        "Much has been written about the chronology of Alexandrian\nliterature and the famous Library, founded by Ptolemy Soter, but\nthe dates of the chief writers are still matters of conjecture.\nThe birth of Apollonius Rhodius is placed by scholars at\nvarious times between 296 and 260 B.C., while the year of his\ndeath is equally uncertain.  In fact, we have very little\ninformation on the subject.  There are two “lives” of Apollonius\nin the Scholia, both derived from an earlier one which is lost.\nFrom these we learn that he was of Alexandria by birth, (1) that\nhe lived in the time of the Ptolemies, and was a pupil of\nCallimachus; that while still a youth he composed and recited in\npublic his “Argonautica”, and that the poem was condemned, in\nconsequence of which he retired to Rhodes; that there he revised\nhis poem, recited it with great applause, and hence called\nhimself a Rhodian.  The second “life” adds: “Some say that he\nreturned to Alexandria and again recited his poem with the utmost\nsuccess, so that he was honoured with the libraries of the Museum\nand was buried with Callimachus.”  The last sentence may be\ninterpreted by the notice of Suidas, who informs us that\nApollonius was a contemporary of Eratosthenes, Euphorion and\nTimarchus, in the time of Ptolemy Euergetes, and that he\nsucceeded Eratosthenes in the headship of the Alexandrian\nLibrary.  Suidas also informs us elsewhere that Aristophanes at\nthe age of sixty-two succeeded Apollonius in this office.  Many\nmodern scholars deny the “bibliothecariate” of Apollonius for\nchronological reasons, and there is considerable difficulty about\nit.  The date of Callimachus’ “Hymn to Apollo”, which closes with\nsome lines (105-113) that are admittedly an allusion to\nApollonius, may be put with much probability at 248 or 247 B.C.\nApollonius must at that date have been at least twenty years old.\nEratosthenes died 196-193 B.C.  This would make Apollonius\nseventy-two to seventy-five when he succeeded Eratosthenes.  This\nis not impossible, it is true, but it is difficult.  But the\ndifficulty is taken away if we assume with Ritschl that\nEratosthenes resigned his office some years before his death,\nwhich allows us to put the birth of Apollonius at about 280, and\nwould solve other difficulties.  For instance, if the Librarians\nwere buried within the precincts, it would account for the burial\nof Apollonius next to Callimachus–Eratosthenes being still\nalive.  However that may be, it is rather arbitrary to take away\nthe “bibliothecariate” of Apollonius, which is clearly asserted\nby Suidas, on account of chronological calculations which are\nthemselves uncertain.  Moreover, it is more probable that the\nwords following “some say” in the second “life” are a remnant of\nthe original life than a conjectural addition, because the first\n\"life” is evidently incomplete, nothing being said about the end\nof Apollonius’ career.",
        "The principal event in his life, so far as we know, was the\nquarrel with his master Callimachus, which was most probably the\ncause of his condemnation at Alexandria and departure to Rhodes.\nThis quarrel appears to have arisen from differences of literary\naims and taste, but, as literary differences often do,\ndegenerated into the bitterest personal strife.  There are\nreferences to the quarrel in the writings of both.  Callimachus\nattacks Apollonius in the passage at the end of the “Hymn to\nApollo”, already mentioned, also probably in some epigrams, but\nmost of all in his “Ibis”, of which we have an imitation, or\nperhaps nearly a translation, in Ovid’s poem of the same name. \nOn the part of Apollonius there is a passage in the third book of\nthe “Argonautica” (11. 927-947) which is of a polemical nature\nand stands out from the context, and the well-known savage\nepigram upon Callimachus. (2)  Various combinations have been\nattempted by scholars, notably by Couat, in his “Poesie\nAlexandrine”, to give a connected account of the quarrel, but we\nhave not data sufficient to determine the order of the attacks,\nand replies, and counter-attacks.  The “Ibis” has been thought to\nmark the termination of the feud on the curious ground that it\nwas impossible for abuse to go further.  It was an age when\nliterary men were more inclined to comment on writings of the\npast than to produce original work.  Literature was engaged in\ntaking stock of itself.  Homer was, of course, professedly\nadmired by all, but more admired than imitated.  Epic poetry was\nout of fashion and we find many epigrams of this period–some\nby Callimachus–directed against the “cyclic” poets, by whom\nwere meant at that time those who were always dragging in\nconventional and commonplace epithets and phrases peculiar to\nepic poetry.  Callimachus was in accordance with the spirit of\nthe age when he proclaimed “a great book” to be “a great evil”,\nand sought to confine poetical activity within the narrowest\nlimits both of subject and space.  Theocritus agreed with him,\nboth in principle and practice.  The chief characteristics of\nAlexandrianism are well summarized by Professor Robinson Ellis as\nfollows: “Precision in form and metre, refinement in diction, a\nlearning often degenerating into pedantry and obscurity, a\nresolute avoidance of everything commonplace in subject,\nsentiment or allusion.”  These traits are more prominent in\nCallimachus than in Apollonius, but they are certainly to be seen\nin the latter.  He seems to have written the “Argonautica” out of\nbravado, to show that he could write an epic poem.  But the\ninfluence of the age was too strong.  Instead of the unity of an\nEpic we have merely a series of episodes, and it is the great\nbeauty and power of one of these episodes that gives the poem its\npermanent value–the episode of the love of Jason and Medea.\nThis occupies the greater part of the third book.  The first and\nsecond books are taken up with the history of the voyage to\nColchis, while the fourth book describes the return voyage. \nThese portions constitute a metrical guide book, filled no doubt\nwith many pleasing episodes, such as the rape of Hylas, the\nboxing match between Pollux and Amyeus, the account of Cyzicus,\nthe account of the Amazons, the legend of Talos, but there is no\nunity running through the poem beyond that of the voyage itself.",
        "The Tale of the Argonauts had been told often before in verse and\nprose, and many authors’ names are given in the Scholia to\nApollonius, but their works have perished.  The best known\nearlier account that we have is that in Pindar’s fourth Pythian\node, from which Apollonius has taken many details.  The subject\nwas one for an epic poem, for its unity might have been found in\nthe working out of the expiation due for the crime of Athamas;\nbut this motive is barely mentioned by our author.",
        "As we have it, the motive of the voyage is the command of Pelias\nto bring back the golden fleece, and this command is based on\nPelias’ desire to destroy Jason, while the divine aid given to\nJason results from the intention of Hera to punish Pelias for his\nneglect of the honour due to her.  The learning of Apollonius is\nnot deep but it is curious; his general sentiments are not\naccording to the Alexandrian standard, for they are simple and\nobvious.  In the mass of material from which he had to choose the\ndifficulty was to know what to omit, and much skill is shown in\nfusing into a tolerably harmonious whole conflicting mythological\nand historical details.  He interweaves with his narrative local\nlegends and the founding of cities, accounts of strange customs,\ndescriptions of works of art, such as that of Ganymede and Eros\nplaying with knucklebones, (3) but prosaically calls himself back\nto the point from these pleasing digressions by such an\nexpression as “but this would take me too far from my song.”  His\nbusiness is the straightforward tale and nothing else.  The\nastonishing geography of the fourth book reminds us of the\ninterest of the age in that subject, stimulated no doubt by the\nresearches of Eratosthenes and others.",
        "The language is that of the conventional epic.  Apollonius seems\nto have carefully studied Homeric glosses, and gives many\nexamples of isolated uses, but his choice of words is by no means\nlimited to Homer.  He freely avails himself of Alexandrian words\nand late uses of Homeric words.  Among his contemporaries\nApollonius suffers from a comparison with Theocritus, who was a\nlittle his senior, but he was much admired by Roman writers who\nderived inspiration from the great classical writers of Greece by\nway of Alexandria.  In fact Alexandria was a useful bridge\nbetween Athens and Rome.  The “Argonautica” was translated by\nVarro Atacinus, copied by Ovid and Virgil, and minutely studied\nby Valerius Flaccus in his poem of the same name.  Some of his\nfinest passages have been appropriated and improved upon by\nVirgil by the divine right of superior genius. (4)  The subject\nof love had been treated in the romantic spirit before the time\nof Apollonius in writings that have perished, for instance, in\nthose of Antimachus of Colophon, but the “Argonautica” is perhaps\nthe first poem still extant in which the expression of this\nspirit is developed with elaboration.  The Medea of Apollonius is\nthe direct precursor of the Dido of Virgil, and it is the pathos\nand passion of the fourth book of the “Aeneid” that keep alive\nmany a passage of Apollonius.",
        "ENDNOTES:\n(1)  “Or of Naucratis”, according to Aelian and Athenaeus.\n(2)  Anth. Pal. xl. 275.\n(3)  iii. 117-124.\n(4)  e.g. compare “Aen.” iv. 305 foll. with Ap. Rh. iv. 355\n     foll.; “Aen.” iv. 327-330 with Ap. Rh. I. 897, 898; “Aen.\"\n     iv. 522 foll., with Ap. Rh. iii. 744 foll.",
        "(ll. 1-4)  Beginning with thee, O Phoebus, I will recount the\nfamous deeds of men of old, who, at the behest of King Pelias,\ndown through the mouth of Pontus and between the Cyanean rocks,\nsped well-benched Argo in quest of the golden fleece.",
        "(ll. 5-17)  Such was the oracle that Pelias heard, that a hateful\ndoom awaited him to be slain at the prompting of the man whom he\nshould see coming forth from the people with but one sandal.  And\nno long time after, in accordance with that true report, Jason\ncrossed the stream of wintry Anaurus on foot, and saved one\nsandal from the mire, but the other he left in the depths held\nback by the flood.  And straightway he came to Pelias to share\nthe banquet which the king was offering to his father Poseidon\nand the rest of the gods, though he paid no honour to Pelasgian\nHera.  Quickly the king saw him and pondered, and devised for him\nthe toil of a troublous voyage, in order that on the sea or among\nstrangers he might lose his home-return.",
        "(ll. 18-22)  The ship, as former bards relate, Argus wrought by\nthe guidance of Athena.  But now I will tell the lineage and the\nnames of the heroes, and of the long sea-paths and the deeds they\nwrought in their wanderings; may the Muses be the inspirers of my\nsong!",
        "(ll. 23-34)  First then let us name Orpheus whom once Calliope\nbare, it is said, wedded to Thracian Oeagrus, near the Pimpleian\nheight.  Men say that he by the music of his songs charmed the\nstubborn rocks upon the mountains and the course of rivers.  And\nthe wild oak-trees to this day, tokens of that magic strain, that\ngrow at Zone on the Thracian shore, stand in ordered ranks close\ntogether, the same which under the charm of his lyre he led down\nfrom Pieria.  Such then was Orpheus whom Aeson’s son welcomed to\nshare his toils, in obedience to the behest of Cheiron, Orpheus\nruler of Bistonian Pieria.",
        "(ll. 35-39)  Straightway came Asterion, whom Cometes begat by the\nwaters of eddying Apidanus; he dwelt at Peiresiae near the\nPhylleian mount, where mighty Apidanus and bright Enipeus join\ntheir streams, coming together from afar.",
        "(ll. 40-44)  Next to them from Larisa came Polyphemus, son of\nEilatus, who aforetime among the mighty Lapithae, when they were\narming themselves against the Centaurs, fought in his younger\ndays; now his limbs were grown heavy with age, but his martial\nspirit still remained, even as of old.",
        "(ll. 45-48)  Nor was Iphiclus long left behind in Phylace, the\nuncle of Aeson’s son; for Aeson had wedded his sister Alcimede,\ndaughter of Phylacus: his kinship with her bade him be numbered\nin the host.",
        "(ll. 49-50)  Nor did Admetus, the lord of Pherae rich in sheep,\nstay behind beneath the peak of the Chalcodonian mount.",
        "(ll. 51-56)  Nor at Alope stayed the sons of Hermes, rich in\ncorn-land, well skilled in craftiness, Erytus and Echion, and\nwith them on their departure their kinsman Aethalides went as the\nthird; him near the streams of Amphrysus Eupolemeia bare, the\ndaughter of Myrmidon, from Phthia; the two others were sprung\nfrom Antianeira, daughter of Menetes.",
        "(ll. 57-64)  From rich Gyrton came Coronus, son of Caeneus,\nbrave, but not braver than his father.  For bards relate that\nCaeneus though still living perished at the hands of the\nCentaurs, when apart from other chiefs he routed them; and they,\nrallying against him, could neither bend nor slay him; but\nunconquered and unflinching he passed beneath the earth,\noverwhelmed by the downrush of massy pines.",
        "(ll. 65-68)  There came too Titaresian Mopsus, whom above all men\nthe son of Leto taught the augury of birds; and Eurydamas the son\nof Ctimenus; he dwelt at Dolopian Ctimene near the Xynian lake.",
        "(ll. 69-70)  Moreover Actor sent his son Menoetius from Opus that\nhe might accompany the chiefs.",
        "(ll. 71-76)  Eurytion followed and strong Eribotes, one the son\nof Teleon, the other of Irus, Actor’s son; the son of Teleon\nrenowned Eribotes, and of Irus Eurytion.  A third with them was\nOileus, peerless in courage and well skilled to attack the flying\nfoe, when they break their ranks.",
        "(ll. 77-85)  Now from Euboea came Canthus eager for the quest,\nwhom Canethus son of Abas sent; but he was not destined to return\nto Cerinthus.  For fate had ordained that he and Mopsus, skilled\nin the seer’s art, should wander and perish in the furthest ends\nof Libya.  For no ill is too remote for mortals to incur, seeing\nthat they buried them in Libya, as far from the Colchians as is\nthe space that is seen between the setting and the rising of the\nsun.",
        "(ll. 86-89)  To him Clytius and Iphitus joined themselves, the\nwarders of Oechalia, sons of Eurytus the ruthless, Eurytus, to\nwhom the Far-shooting god gave his bow; but he had no joy of the\ngift; for of his own choice he strove even with the giver.",
        "(ll. 90-94)  After them came the sons of Aeacus, not both\ntogether, nor from the same spot; for they settled far from\nAegina in exile, when in their folly they had slain their brother\nPhoeus.  Telamon dwelt in the Attic island; but Peleus departed\nand made his home in Phthia.",
        "(ll. 95-104)  After them from Cecropia came warlike Butes, son of\nbrave Teleon, and Phalerus of the ashen spear.  Alcon his father\nsent him forth; yet no other sons had he to care for his old age\nand livelihood.  But him, his well-beloved and only son, he sent\nforth that amid bold heroes he might shine conspicuous.  But\nTheseus, who surpassed all the sons of Erechtheus, an unseen bond\nkept beneath the land of Taenarus, for he had followed that path\nwith Peirithous; assuredly both would have lightened for all the\nfulfilment of their toil.",
        "(ll. 105-114)  Tiphys, son of Hagnias, left the Siphaean people\nof the Thespians, well skilled to foretell the rising wave on the\nbroad sea, and well skilled to infer from sun and star the stormy\nwinds and the time for sailing.  Tritonian Athena herself urged\nhim to join the band of chiefs, and he came among them a welcome\ncomrade.  She herself too fashioned the swift ship; and with her\nArgus, son of Arestor, wrought it by her counsels.  Wherefore it\nproved the most excellent of all ships that have made trial of\nthe sea with oars.",
        "(ll. 115-117)  After them came Phlias from Araethyrea, where he\ndwelt in affluence by the favour of his father Dionysus, in his\nhome by the springs of Asopus.",
        "(ll. 118-121)  From Argos came Talaus and Areius, sons of Bias,\nand mighty Leodocus, all of whom Pero daughter of Neleus bare; on\nher account the Aeolid Melampus endured sore affliction in the\nsteading of Iphiclus.",
        "(ll. 122-132)  Nor do we learn that Heracles of the mighty heart\ndisregarded the eager summons of Aeson’s son.  But when he heard\na report of the heroes’ gathering and had reached Lyrceian Argos\nfrom Arcadia by the road along which he carried the boar alive\nthat fed in the thickets of Lampeia, near the vast Erymanthian\nswamp, the boar bound with chains he put down from his huge\nshoulders at the entrance to the market-place of Mycenae; and\nhimself of his own will set out against the purpose of\nEurystheus; and with him went Hylas, a brave comrade, in the\nflower of youth, to bear his arrows and to guard his bow.",
        "(ll. 133-138)  Next to him came a scion of the race of divine\nDanaus, Nauplius.  He was the son of Clytonaeus son of Naubolus;\nNaubolus was son of Lernus; Lernus we know was the son of Proetus\nson of Nauplius; and once Amymone daughter of Danaus, wedded to\nPoseidon, bare Nauplius, who surpassed all men in naval skill.",
        "(ll. 139-145)  Idmon came last of all them that dwelt at Argos,\nfor though he had learnt his own fate by augury, he came, that\nthe people might not grudge him fair renown.  He was not in truth\nthe son of Abas, but Leto’s son himself begat him to be numbered\namong the illustrious Aeolids; and himself taught him the art of\nprophecy–to pay heed to birds and to observe the signs of the\nburning sacrifice.",
        "(ll. 146-150)  Moreover Aetolian Leda sent from Sparta strong\nPolydeuces and Castor, skilled to guide swift-footed steeds;\nthese her dearly-loved sons she bare at one birth in the house of\nTyndareus; nor did she forbid their departure; for she had\nthoughts worthy of the bride of Zeus.",
        "(ll. 151-155)  The sons of Aphareus, Lynceus and proud Idas, came\nfrom Arene, both exulting in their great strength; and Lynceus\ntoo excelled in keenest sight, if the report is true that that\nhero could easily direct his sight even beneath the earth.",
        "(ll. 156-160)  And with them Neleian Periclymenus set out to\ncome, eldest of all the sons of godlike Neleus who were born at\nPylos; Poseidon had given him boundless strength and granted him\nthat whatever shape he should crave during the fight, that he\nshould take in the stress of battle.",
        "(ll. 161-171)  Moreover from Arcadia came Amphidamas and Cepheus,\nwho inhabited Tegea and the allotment of Apheidas, two sons of\nAldus; and Ancaeus followed them as the third, whom his father\nLycurgus sent, the brother older than both.  But he was left in\nthe city to care for Aleus now growing old, while he gave his son\nto join his brothers.  Antaeus went clad in the skin of a\nMaenalian bear, and wielding in his right hand a huge two-edged\nbattleaxe.  For his armour his grandsire had hidden in the\nhouse’s innermost recess, to see if he might by some means still\nstay his departure.",
        "(ll. 172-175)  There came also Augeias, whom fame declared to be\nthe son of Helios; he reigned over the Eleans, glorying in his\nwealth; and greatly he desired to behold the Colchian land and\nAeetes himself the ruler of the Colchians.",
        "(ll. 176-178)  Asterius and Amphion, sons of Hyperasius, came\nfrom Achaean Pellene, which once Pelles their grandsire founded\non the brows of Aegialus.",
        "(ll. 179-184)  After them from Taenarus came Euphemus whom, most\nswift-footed of men, Europe, daughter of mighty Tityos, bare to\nPoseidon.  He was wont to skim the swell of the grey sea, and\nwetted not his swift feet, but just dipping the tips of his toes\nwas borne on the watery path.",
        "(ll. 185-189)  Yea, and two other sons of Poseidon came; one\nErginus, who left the citadel of glorious Miletus, the other\nproud Ancaeus, who left Parthenia, the seat of Imbrasion Hera;\nboth boasted their skill in seacraft and in war.",
        "(ll. 190-201)  After them from Calydon came the son of Oeneus,\nstrong Meleagrus, and Laocoon–Laocoon the brother of Oeneus,\nthough not by the same mother, for a serving-woman bare him; him,\nnow growing old, Oeneus sent to guard his son: thus Meleagrus,\nstill a youth, entered the bold band of heroes.  No other had\ncome superior to him, I ween, except Heracles, if for one year\nmore he had tarried and been nurtured among the Aetolians.  Yea,\nand his uncle, well skilled to fight whether with the javelin or\nhand to hand, Iphiclus son of Thestius, bare him company on his\nway.",
        "(ll. 202-206)  With him came Palaemonius, son of Olenian Lernus,\nof Lernus by repute, but his birth was from Hephaestus; and so he\nwas crippled in his feet, but his bodily frame and his valour no\none would dare to scorn.  Wherefore he was numbered among all the\nchiefs, winning fame for Jason.",
        "(ll. 207-210)  From the Phocians came Iphitus sprung from\nNaubolus son of Ornytus; once he had been his host when Jason\nwent to Pytho to ask for a response concerning his voyage; for\nthere he welcomed him in his own hails.",
        "(ll. 211-223)  Next came Zetes and Calais, sons of Boreas, whom\nonce Oreithyia, daughter of Erechtheus, bare to Boreas on the\nverge of wintry Thrace; thither it was that Thracian Boreas\nsnatched her away from Cecropia as she was whirling in the dance,\nhard by Hissus’ stream.  And, carrying her far off, to the spot\nthat men called the rock of Sarpedon, near the river Erginus, he\nwrapped her in dark clouds and forced her to his will.  There\nthey were making their dusky wings quiver upon their ankles on\nboth sides as they rose, a great wonder to behold, wings that\ngleamed with golden scales: and round their backs from the top of\nthe head and neck, hither and thither, their dark tresses were\nbeing shaken by the wind.",
        "(ll. 224-227)  No, nor had Acastus son of mighty Pelias himself\nany will to stay behind in the palace of his brave sire, nor\nArgus, helper of the goddess Athena; but they too were ready to\nbe numbered in the host.",
        "(ll. 228-233)  So many then were the helpers who assembled to\njoin the son of Aeson.  All the chiefs the dwellers thereabout\ncalled Minyae, for the most and the bravest avowed that they were\nsprung from the blood of the daughters of Minyas; thus Jason\nhimself was the son of Alcimede who was born of Clymene the\ndaughter of Minyas.",
        "(ll. 234-241)  Now when all things had been made ready by the\nthralls, all things that fully-equipped ships are furnished\nwithal when men’s business leads them to voyage across the sea,\nthen the heroes took their way through the city to the ship where\nit lay on the strand that men call Magnesian Pagasae; and a crowd\nof people hastening rushed together; but the heroes shone like\ngleaming stars among the clouds; and each man as he saw them\nspeeding along with their armour would say:",
        "(ll. 242-246)  “King Zeus, what is the purpose of Pelias? \nWhither is he driving forth from the Panachaean land so great a\nhost of heroes?  On one day they would waste the palace of Aeetes\nwith baleful fire, should he not yield them the fleece of his own\ngoodwill.  But the path is not to be shunned, the toil is hard\nfor those who venture.”",
        "(ll. 247-250)  Thus they spake here and there throughout the\ncity; but the women often raised their hands to the sky in prayer\nto the immortals to grant a return, their hearts’ desire.  And\none with tears thus lamented to her fellow:",
        "(ll. 251-260)  “Wretched Alcimede, evil has come to thee at last\nthough late, thou hast not ended with splendour of life.  Aeson\ntoo, ill-fated man!  Surely better had it been for him, if he\nwere lying beneath the earth, enveloped in his shroud, still\nunconscious of bitter toils.  Would that the dark wave, when the\nmaiden Helle perished, had overwhelmed Phrixus too with the ram;\nbut the dire portent even sent forth a human voice, that it might\ncause to Alcimede sorrows and countless pains hereafter.”",
        "(ll. 261-277)  Thus the women spake at the departure of the\nheroes.  And now many thralls, men and women, were gathered\ntogether, and his mother, smitten with grief for Jason.  And a\nbitter pang seized every woman’s heart; and with them groaned the\nfather in baleful old age, lying on his bed, closely wrapped\nround.  But the hero straightway soothed their pain, encouraging\nthem, and bade the thralls take up his weapons for war; and they\nin silence with downcast looks took them up.  And even as the\nmother had thrown her arms about her son, so she clung, weeping\nwithout stint, as a maiden all alone weeps, falling fondly on the\nneck of her hoary nurse, a maid who has now no others to care for\nher, but she drags on a weary life under a stepmother, who\nmaltreats her continually with ever fresh insults, and as she\nweeps, her heart within her is bound fast with misery, nor can\nshe sob forth all the groans that struggle for utterance; so\nwithout stint wept Alcimede straining her son in her arms, and in\nher yearning grief spake as follows:",
        "(ll. 278-291)  “Would that on that day when, wretched woman that\nI am, I heard King Pelias proclaim his evil behest, I had\nstraightway given up my life and forgotten my cares, so that thou\nthyself, my son, with thine own hands, mightest have buried me;\nfor that was the only wish left me still to be fulfilled by time,\nall the other rewards for thy nurture have I long enjoyed.  Now\nI, once so admired among Achaean women, shall be left behind like\na bondwoman in my empty halls, pining away, ill-fated one, for\nlove of thee, thee on whose account I had aforetime so much\nsplendour and renown, my only son for whom I loosed my virgin\nzone first and last.  For to me beyond others the goddess\nEileithyia grudged abundant offspring.  Alas for my folly!  Not\nonce, not even in nay dreams did I forebode this, that the flight\nof Phrixus would bring me woe.”",
        "(ll. 292-294)  Thus with moaning she wept, and her handmaidens,\nstanding by, lamented; but Jason spake gently to her with\ncomforting words:",
        "(ll. 295-305)  “Do not, I pray thee, mother, store up bitter\nsorrows overmuch, for thou wilt not redeem me from evil by tears,\nbut wilt still add grief to grief.  For unseen are the woes that\nthe gods mete out to mortals; be strong to endure thy share of\nthem though with grief in thy heart; take courage from the\npromises of Athena, and from the answers of the gods (for very\nfavourable oracles has Phoebus given), and then from the help of\nthe chieftains.  But do thou remain here, quiet among thy\nhandmaids, and be not a bird of ill omen to the ship; and thither\nmy clansmen and thralls will follow me.”",
        "(ll. 306-316)  He spake, and started forth to leave the house.\nAnd as Apollo goes forth from some fragrant shrine to divine\nDelos or Claros or Pytho or to broad Lyeia near the stream of\nXanthus, in such beauty moved Jason through the throng of people;\nand a cry arose as they shouted together.  And there met him aged\nIphias, priestess of Artemis guardian of the city, and kissed his\nright hand, but she had not strength to say a word, for all her\neagerness, as the crowd rushed on, but she was left there by the\nwayside, as the old are left by the young, and he passed on and\nwas gone afar.",
        "(ll. 317-331)  Now when he had left the well-built streets of the\ncity, he came to the beach of Pagasae, where his comrades greeted\nhim as they stayed together near the ship Argo.  And he stood at\nthe entering in, and they were gathered to meet him.  And they\nperceived Aeastus and Argus coming from the city, and they\nmarvelled when they saw them hasting with all speed, despite the\nwill of Pelias.  The one, Argus, son of Arestor, had cast round\nhis shoulders the hide of a bull reaching to his feet, with the\nblack hair upon it, the other, a fair mantle of double fold,\nwhich his sister Pelopeia had given him.  Still Jason forebore\nfrom asking them about each point but bade all be seated for an\nassembly.  And there, upon the folded sails and the mast as it\nlay on the ground, they all took their seats in order.  And among\nthem with goodwill spake Aeson’s son:",
        "(ll. 332-340)  “All the equipment that a ship needs for all is in\ndue order–lies ready for our departure.  Therefore we will\nmake no long delay in our sailing for these things’ sake, when\nthe breezes but blow fair.  But, friends,–for common to all is\nour return to Hellas hereafter, and common to all is our path to\nthe land of Aeetes–now therefore with ungrudging heart choose\nthe bravest to be our leader, who shall be careful for\neverything, to take upon him our quarrels and covenants with\nstrangers.”",
        "(ll. 341-344)  Thus he spake; and the young heroes turned their\neyes towards bold Heracles sitting in their midst, and with one\nshout they all enjoined upon him to be their leader; but he, from\nthe place where he sat, stretched forth his right hand and said:",
        "(ll. 345-347)  “Let no one offer this honour to me.  For I will\nnot consent, and I will forbid any other to stand up.  Let the\nhero who brought us together, himself be the leader of the host.”",
        "(ll. 348-350)  Thus he spake with high thoughts, and they\nassented, as Heracles bade; and warlike Jason himself rose up,\nglad at heart, and thus addressed the eager throng:",
        "(ll. 351-362)  “If ye entrust your glory to my care, no longer as\nbefore let our path be hindered.  Now at last let us propitiate\nPhoebus with sacrifice and straightway prepare a feast.  And\nuntil my thralls come, the overseers of my steading, whose care\nit is to choose out oxen from the herd and drive them hither, we\nwill drag down the ship to the sea, and do ye place all the\ntackling within, and draw lots for the benches for rowing.\nMeantime let us build upon the beach an altar to Apollo Embasius\n(1) who by an oracle promised to point out and show me the paths\nof the sea, if by sacrifice to him I should begin my venture for\nKing Pelias.”",
        "(ll. 363-393)  He spake, and was the first to turn to the work,\nand they stood up in obedience to him; and they heaped their\ngarments, one upon the other, on a smooth stone, which the sea\ndid not strike with its waves, but the stormy surge had cleansed\nit long before.  First of all, by the command of Argus, they\nstrongly girded the ship with a rope well twisted within, (2)\nstretching it tight on each side, in order that the planks might\nbe well compacted by the bolts and might withstand the opposing\nforce of the surge.  And they quickly dug a trench as wide as the\nspace the ship covered, and at the prow as far into the sea as it\nwould run when drawn down by their hands.  And they ever dug\ndeeper in front of the stem, and in the furrow laid polished\nrollers; and inclined the ship down upon the first rollers, that\nso she might glide and be borne on by them.  And above, on both\nsides, reversing the oars, they fastened them round the thole-\npins, so as to project a cubit’s space.  And the heroes\nthemselves stood on both sides at the oars in a row, and pushed\nforward with chest and hand at once.  And then Tiphys leapt on\nboard to urge the youths to push at the right moment; and calling\non them he shouted loudly; and they at once, leaning with all\ntheir strength, with one push started the ship from her place,\nand strained with their feet, forcing her onward; and Pelian Argo\nfollowed swiftly; and they on each side shouted as they rushed\non.  And then the rollers groaned under the sturdy keel as they\nwere chafed, and round them rose up a dark smoke owing to the\nweight, and she glided into the sea; but the heroes stood there\nand kept dragging her back as she sped onward.  And round the\nthole-pins they fitted the oars, and in the ship they placed the\nmast and the well-made sails and the stores.",
        "(ll. 394-401)  Now when they had carefully paid heed to\neverything, first they distributed the benches by lot, two men\noccupying one seat; but the middle bench they chose for Heracles\nand Ancaeus apart from the other heroes, Ancaeus who dwelt in\nTegea.  For them alone they left the middle bench just as it was\nand not by lot; and with one consent they entrusted Tiphys with\nguarding the helm of the well-stemmed ship.",
        "(ll. 402-410)  Next, piling up shingle near the sea, they raised\nthere an altar on the shore to Apollo, under the name of Actius\n(3) and Embasius, and quickly spread above it logs of dried\nolive-wood.  Meantime the herdsmen of Aeson’s son had driven\nbefore them from the herd two steers.  These the younger comrades\ndragged near the altars, and the others brought lustral water and\nbarley meal, and Jason prayed, calling on Apollo the god of his\nfathers:",
        "(ll. 411-424)  “Hear, O King, that dwellest in Pagasae and the\ncity Aesonis, the city called by my father’s name, thou who didst\npromise me, when I sought thy oracle at Pytho, to show the\nfulfilment and goal of my journey, for thou thyself hast been the\ncause of my venture; now do thou thyself guide the ship with my\ncomrades safe and sound, thither and back again to Hellas.  Then\nin thy honour hereafter we will lay again on thy altar the bright\nofferings of bulls–all of us who return; and other gifts in\ncountless numbers I will bring to Pytho and Ortygia.  And now,\ncome, Far-darter, accept this sacrifice at our hands, which first\nof all we have offered thee for this ship on our embarcation; and\ngrant, O King, that with a prosperous weird I may loose the\nhawsers, relying on thy counsel, and may the breeze blow softly\nwith which we shall sail over the sea in fair weather.”",
        "(ll. 425-439)  He spake, and with his prayer cast the barley\nmeal.  And they two girded themselves to slay the steers, proud\nAncaeus and Heracles.  The latter with his club smote one steer\nmid-head on the brow, and falling in a heap on the spot, it sank\nto the ground; and Ancaeus struck the broad neck of the other\nwith his axe of bronze, and shore through the mighty sinews; and\nit fell prone on both its horns.  Their comrades quickly severed\nthe victims’ throats, and flayed the hides: they sundered the\njoints and carved the flesh, then cut out the sacred thigh bones,\nand covering them all together closely with fat burnt them upon\ncloven wood.  And Aeson’s son poured out pure libations, and\nIdmon rejoiced beholding the flame as it gleamed on every side\nfrom the sacrifice, and the smoke of it mounting up with good\nomen in dark spiral columns; and quickly he spake outright the\nwill of Leto’s son:",
        "(ll. 440-447)  “For you it is the will of heaven and destiny that\nye shall return here with the fleece; but meanwhile both going\nand returning, countless trials await you.  But it is my lot, by\nthe hateful decree of a god, to die somewhere afar off on the\nmainland of Asia.  Thus, though I learnt my fate from evil omens\neven before now, I have left my fatherland to embark on the ship,\nthat so after my embarking fair fame may be left me in my house.”",
        "(ll. 448-462)  Thus he spake; and the youths hearing the divine\nutterance rejoiced at their return, but grief seized them for the\nfate of Idmon.  Now at the hour when the sun passes his noon-tide\nhalt and the ploughlands are just being shadowed by the rocks, as\nthe sun slopes towards the evening dusk, at that hour all the\nheroes spread leaves thickly upon the sand and lay down in rows\nin front of the hoary surf-line; and near them were spread vast\nstores of viands and sweet wine, which the cupbearers had drawn\noff in pitchers; afterwards they told tales one to another in\nturn, such as youths often tell when at the feast and the bowl\nthey take delightful pastime, and insatiable insolence is far\naway.  But here the son of Aeson, all helpless, was brooding over\neach event in his mind, like one oppressed with thought.  And\nIdas noted him and assailed him with loud voice:",
        "(ll. 463-471)  “Son of Aeson, what is this plan thou art turning\nover in mind.  Speak out thy thought in the midst.  Does fear\ncome on and master thee, fear, that confounds cowards?  Be\nwitness now my impetuous spear, wherewith in wars I win renown\nbeyond all others (nor does Zeus aid me so much as my own spear),\nthat no woe will be fatal, no venture will be unachieved, while\nIdas follows, even though a god should oppose thee.  Such a\nhelpmeet am I that thou bringest from Arene.”",
        "(ll. 472-475)  He spake, and holding a brimming goblet in both\nhands drank off the unmixed sweet wine; and his lips and dark\ncheeks were drenched with it; and all the heroes clamoured\ntogether and Idmon spoke out openly:",
        "(ll. 480-484)  “Vain wretch, thou art devising destruction for\nthyself before the time.  Does the pure wine cause thy bold heart\nto swell in thy breast to thy ruin, and has it set thee on to\ndishonour the gods?  Other words of comfort there are with which\na man might encourage his comrade; but thou hast spoken with\nutter recklessness.  Such taunts, the tale goes, did the sons of\nAloeus once blurt out against the blessed gods, and thou dost no\nwise equal them in valour; nevertheless they were both slain by\nthe swift arrows of Leto’s son, mighty though they were.”",
        "(ll. 485-486)  Thus he spake, and Aphareian Iclas laughed out,\nloud and long, and eyeing him askance replied with biting words:",
        "(ll. 487-491)  “Come now, tell me this by thy prophetic art,\nwhether for me too the gods will bring to pass such doom as thy\nfather promised for the sons of Aloeus.  And bethink thee how\nthou wilt escape from my hands alive, if thou art caught making a\nprophecy vain as the idle wind.”",
        "(ll. 492-495)  Thus in wrath Idas reviled him, and the strife\nwould have gone further had not their comrades and Aeson’s son\nhimself with indignant cry restrained the contending chiefs; and\nOrpheus lifted his lyre in his left hand and made essay to sing.",
        "(ll. 496-511)  He sang how the earth, the heaven and the sea,\nonce mingled together in one form, after deadly strife were\nseparated each from other; and how the stars and the moon and the\npaths of the sun ever keep their fixed place in the sky; and how\nthe mountains rose, and how the resounding rivers with their\nnymphs came into being and all creeping things.  And he sang how\nfirst of all Ophion and Eurynome, daughter of Ocean, held the\nsway of snowy Olympus, and how through strength of arm one\nyielded his prerogative to Cronos and the other to Rhea, and how\nthey fell into the waves of Ocean; but the other two meanwhile\nruled over the blessed Titan-gods, while Zeus, still a child and\nwith the thoughts of a child, dwelt in the Dictaean cave; and the\nearthborn Cyclopes had not yet armed him with the bolt, with\nthunder and lightning; for these things give renown to Zeus.",
        "(ll. 512-518)  He ended, and stayed his lyre and divine voice.\nBut though he had ceased they still bent forward with eagerness\nall hushed to quiet, with ears intent on the enchanting strain;\nsuch a charm of song had he left behind in their hearts.  Not\nlong after they mixed libations in honour of Zeus, with pious\nrites as is customary, and poured them upon the burning tongues,\nand bethought them of sleep in the darkness.",
        "(ll. 519-558)  Now when gleaming dawn with bright eyes beheld the\nlofty peaks of Pelion, and the calm headlands were being drenched\nas the sea was ruffled by the winds, then Tiphys awoke from\nsleep; and at once he roused his comrades to go on board and make\nready the oars.  And a strange cry did the harbour of Pagasae\nutter, yea and Pelian Argo herself, urging them to set forth. \nFor in her a beam divine had been laid which Athena had brought\nfrom an oak of Dodona and fitted in the middle of the stem.  And\nthe heroes went to the benches one after the other, as they had\npreviously assigned for each to row in his place, and took their\nseats in due order near their fighting gear.  In the middle sat\nAntaeus and mighty Heracles, and near him he laid his club, and\nbeneath his tread the ship’s keel sank deep.  And now the hawsers\nwere being slipped and they poured wine on the sea.  But Jason\nwith tears held his eyes away from his fatherland.  And just as\nyouths set up a dance in honour of Phoebus either in Pytho or\nhaply in Ortygia, or by the waters of Ismenus, and to the sound\nof the lyre round his altar all together in time beat the earth\nwith swiftly-moving feet; so they to the sound of Orpheus’ lyre\nsmote with their oars the rushing sea-water, and the surge broke\nover the blades; and on this side and on that the dark brine\nseethed with foam, boiling terribly through the might of the\nsturdy heroes.  And their arms shone in the sun like flame as the\nship sped on; and ever their wake gleamed white far behind, like\na path seen over a green plain.  On that day all the gods looked\ndown from heaven upon the ship and the might of the heroes, half-\ndivine, the bravest of men then sailing the sea; and on the\ntopmost heights the nymphs of Pelion wondered as they beheld the\nwork of Itonian Athena, and the heroes themselves wielding the\noars.  And there came down from the mountain-top to the sea\nChiron, son of Philyra, and where the white surf broke he dipped\nhis feet, and, often waving with his broad hand, cried out to\nthem at their departure, “Good speed and a sorrowless home-\nreturn!”  And with him his wife, bearing Peleus’ son Achilles on\nher arm, showed the child to his dear father.",
        "(ll. 559-579)  Now when they had left the curving shore of the\nharbour through the cunning and counsel of prudent Tiphys son of\nHagnias, who skilfully handled the well-polished helm that he\nmight guide them steadfastly, then at length they set up the tall\nmast in the mastbox, and secured it with forestays, drawing them\ntaut on each side, and from it they let down the sail when they\nhad hauled it to the top-mast.  And a breeze came down piping\nshrilly; and upon the deck they fastened the ropes separately\nround the well-polished pins, and ran quietly past the long\nTisaean headland.  And for them the son of Oeagrus touched his\nlyre and sang in rhythmical song of Artemis, saviour of ships,\nchild of a glorious sire, who hath in her keeping those peaks by\nthe sea, and the land of Iolcos; and the fishes came darting\nthrough the deep sea, great mixed with small, and followed\ngambolling along the watery paths.  And as when in the track of\nthe shepherd, their master, countless sheep follow to the fold\nthat have fed to the full of grass, and he goes before gaily\npiping a shepherd’s strain on Iris shrill reed; so these fishes\nfollowed; and a chasing breeze ever bore the ship onward.",
        "(ll. 580-591)  And straightway the misty land of the Pelasgians,\nrich in cornfields, sank out of sight, and ever speeding onward\nthey passed the rugged sides of Pelion; and the Sepian headland\nsank away, and Sciathus appeared in the sea, and far off appeared\nPiresiae and the calm shore of Magnesia on the mainland and the\ntomb of Dolops; here then in the evening, as the wind blew\nagainst them, they put to land, and paying honour to him at\nnightfall burnt sheep as victims, while the sea was tossed by\nthe swell: and for two days they lingered on the shore, but on\nthe third day they put forth the ship, spreading on high the\nbroad sail.  And even now men call that beach Aphetae (4) of\nArgo.",
        "(ll. 592-608)  Thence going forward they ran past Meliboea,\nescaping a stormy beach and surf-line.  And in the morning they\nsaw Homole close at hand leaning on the sea, and skirted it, and\nnot long after they were about to pass by the outfall of the\nriver Amyrus.  From there they beheld Eurymenae and the seawashed\nravines of Ossa and Olympus; next they reached the slopes of\nPallene, beyond the headland of Canastra, running all night with\nthe wind.  And at dawn before them as they journeyed rose Athos,\nthe Thracian mountain, which with its topmost peak overshadows\nLemnos, even as far as Myrine, though it lies as far off as the\nspace that a well-trimmed merchantship would traverse up to\nmid-day.  For them on that day, till darkness fell, the breeze\nblew exceedingly fresh, and the sails of the ship strained to it.\nBut with the setting of the sun the wind left them, and it was by\nthe oars that they reached Lemnos, the Sintian isle.",
        "(ll. 609-639)  Here the whole of the men of the people together\nhad been ruthlessly slain through the transgressions of the women\nin the year gone by.  For the men had rejected their lawful\nwives, loathing them, and had conceived a fierce passion for\ncaptive maids whom they themselves brought across the sea from\ntheir forays in Thrace; for the terrible wrath of Cypris came\nupon them, because for a long time they had grudged her the\nhonours due.  O hapless women, and insatiate in jealousy to their\nown ruin!  Not their husbands alone with the captives did they\nslay on account of the marriage-bed, but all the males at the\nsame time, that they might thereafter pay no retribution for the\ngrim murder.  And of all the women, Hypsipyle alone spared her\naged father Thoas, who was king over the people; and she sent him\nin a hollow chest, to drift over the sea, if haply he should\nescape.  And fishermen dragged him to shore at the island of\nOenoe, formerly Oenoe, but afterwards called Sicinus from\nSicinus, whom the water-nymph Oenoe bore to Thoas.  Now for all\nthe women to tend kine, to don armour of bronze, and to cleave\nwith the plough-share the wheat-bearing fields, was easier than\nthe works of Athena, with which they were busied aforetime.  Yet\nfor all that did they often gaze over the broad sea, in grievous\nfear against the Thracians’ coming.  So when they saw Argo being\nrowed near the island, straightway crowding in multitude from the\ngates of Myrine and clad in their harness of war, they poured\nforth to the beach like ravening Thyiades: for they deemed that\nthe Thracians were come; and with them Hypsipyle, daughter of\nThoas, donned her father’s harness.  And they streamed down\nspeechless with dismay; such fear was wafted about them.",
        "(ll. 640-652)  Meantime from the ship the chiefs had sent\nAethalides the swift herald, to whose care they entrusted their\nmessages and the wand of Hermes, his sire, who had granted him a\nmemory of all things, that never grew dim; and not even now,\nthough he has entered the unspeakable whirlpools of Acheron, has\nforgetfulness swept over his soul, but its fixed doom is to be\never changing its abode; at one time to be numbered among the\ndwellers beneath the earth, at another to be in the light of the\nsun among living men.  But why need I tell at length tales of\nAethalides?  He at that time persuaded Hypsipyle to receive the\nnew-comers as the day was waning into darkness; nor yet at dawn\ndid they loose the ship’s hawsers to the breath of the north\nwind.",
        "(ll. 653-656)  Now the Lemnian women fared through the city and\nsat down to the assembly, for Hypsipyle herself had so bidden.\nAnd when they were all gathered together in one great throng\nstraightway she spake among them with stirring words:",
        "(ll. 657-666)  “O friends, come let us grant these men gifts to\ntheir hearts’ desire, such as it is fitting that they should take\non ship-board, food and sweet wine, in order that they may\nsteadfastly remain outside our towers, and may not, passing among\nus for need’s sake, get to know us all too well, and so an evil\nreport be widely spread; for we have wrought a terrible deed and\nin nowise will it be to their liking, should they learn it.  Such\nis our counsel now, but if any of you can devise a better plan\nlet her rise, for it was on this account that I summoned you\nhither.”",
        "(ll. 667-674)  Thus she spake and sat upon her father’s seat of\nstone, and then rose up her dear nurse Polyxo, for very age\nhalting upon her withered feet, bowed over a staff, and she was\neager to address them.  Near her were seated four virgins,\nunwedded, crowned with white hair.  And she stood in the midst of\nthe assembly and from her bent back she feebly raised her neck\nand spake thus:",
        "(ll. 675-696)  “Gifts, as Hypsipyle herself wishes, let us send\nto the strangers, for it is better to give them.  But for you\nwhat device have ye to get profit of your life if the Thracian\nhost fall upon us, or some other foe, as often happens among men,\neven as now this company is come unforeseen?  But if one of the\nblessed gods should turn this aside yet countless other woes,\nworse than battle, remain behind, when the aged women die off and\nye younger ones, without children, reach hateful old age.  How\nthen will ye live, hapless ones?  Will your oxen of their own\naccord yoke themselves for the deep plough-lands and draw the\nearth-cleaving share through the fallow, and forthwith, as the\nyear comes round, reap the harvest?  Assuredly, though the fates\ntill now have shunned me in horror, I deem that in the coming\nyear I shall put on the garment of earth, when I have received my\nmeed of burial even so as is right, before the evil days draw\nnear.  But I bid you who are younger give good heed to this.  For\nnow at your feet a way of escape lies open, if ye trust to the\nstrangers the care of your homes and all your stock and your\nglorious city.”",
        "(ll. 697-699) Thus she spake, and the assembly was filled with\nclamour.  For the word pleased them.  And after her straightway\nHypsipyle rose up again, and thus spake in reply.",
        "(ll. 700-701)  “If this purpose please you all, now will I even\nsend a messenger to the ship.”",
        "(ll. 702-707)  She spake and addressed Iphinoe close at hand:\n\"Go, Iphinoe, and beg yonder man, whoever it is that leads this\narray, to come to our land that I may tell him a word that\npleases the heart of my people, and bid the men themselves, if\nthey wish, boldly enter the land and the city with friendly\nintent.”",
        "(ll. 708-711)  She spake, and dismissed the assembly, and\nthereafter started to return home.  And so Iphinoe came to the\nMinyae; and they asked with what intent she had come among them.\nAnd quickly she addressed her questioners with all speed in these\nwords:",
        "(ll. 712-716) “The maiden Hypsipyle daughter of Thoas, sent me on\nmy way here to you, to summon the captain of your ship, whoever\nhe be, that she may tell him a word that pleases the heart of the\npeople, and she bids yourselves, if ye wish it, straightway enter\nthe land and the city with friendly intent.”",
        "(ll. 717-720)  Thus she spake and the speech of good omen pleased\nall.  And they deemed that Thoas was dead and that his beloved\ndaughter Hypsipyle was queen, and quickly they sent Jason on his\nway and themselves made ready to go.",
        "(ll. 721-729)  Now he had buckled round his shoulders a purple\nmantle of double fold, the work of the Tritonian goddess, which\nPallas had given him when she first laid the keel-props of the\nship Argo and taught him how to measure timbers with the rule.\nMore easily wouldst thou cast thy eyes upon the sun at its rising\nthan behold that blazing splendour.  For indeed in the middle the\nfashion thereof was red, but at the ends it was all purple, and\non each margin many separate devices had been skilfully inwoven.",
        "(ll. 730-734)  In it were the Cyclops seated at their\nimperishable work, forging a thunderbolt for King Zeus; by now it\nwas almost finished in its brightness and still it wanted but one\nray, which they were beating out with their iron hammers as it\nspurted forth a breath of raging flame.",
        "(ll. 735-741)  In it too were the twin sons of Antiope, daughter\nof Asopus, Amphion and Zethus, and Thebe still ungirt with towers\nwas lying near, whose foundations they were just then laying in\neager haste.  Zethus on his shoulders was lifting the peak of a\nsteep mountain, like a man toiling hard, and Amphion after him,\nsinging loud and clear on his golden lyre, moved on, and a rock\ntwice as large followed his footsteps.",
        "(ll. 742-746)  Next in order had been wrought Cytherea with\ndrooping tresses, wielding the swift shield of Ares; and from her\nshoulder to her left arm the fastening of her tunic was loosed\nbeneath her breast; and opposite in the shield of bronze her\nimage appeared clear to view as she stood.",
        "(ll. 747-751)  And in it there was a well-wooded pasturage of\noxen; and about the oxen the Teleboae and the sons of Eleetryon\nwere fighting; the one party defending themselves, the others,\nthe Taphian raiders, longing to rob them; and the dewy meadow was\ndrenched with their blood, and the many were overmastering the\nfew herdsmen.",
        "(ll. 752-758)  And therein were fashioned two chariots, racing,\nand the one in front Pelops was guiding, as he shook the reins,\nand with him was Hippodameia at his side, and in pursuit Myrtilus\nurged his steeds, and with him Oenomaus had grasped his couched\nspear, but fell as the axle swerved and broke in the nave, while\nhe was eager to pierce the back of Pelops.",
        "(ll. 759-762)  And in it was wrought Phoebus Apollo, a stripling\nnot yet grown up, in the act of shooting at mighty Tityos who was\nboldly dragging his mother by her veil, Tityos whom glorious\nElate bare, but Earth nursed him and gave him second birth.",
        "(ll. 763-767)  And in it was Phrixus the Minyan as though he were\nin very deed listening to the ram, while it was like one\nspeaking.  Beholding them thou wouldst be silent and wouldst\ncheat thy soul with the hope of hearing some wise speech from\nthem, and long wouldst thou gaze with that hope.",
        "(ll. 768-773)  Such then were the gifts of the Tritonian goddess\nAthena.  And in his right hand Jason held a fardarting spear,\nwhich Atalanta gave him once as a gift of hospitality in Maenalus\nas she met him gladly; for she eagerly desired to follow on that\nquest; but he himself of his own accord prevented the maid, for\nhe feared bitter strife on account of her love.",
        "(ll. 774-792)  And he went on his way to the city like to a\nbright star, which maidens, pent up in new-built chambers, behold\nas it rises above their homes, and through the dark air it charms\ntheir eyes with its fair red gleam and the maid rejoices,\nlove-sick for the youth who is far away amid strangers, for whom\nher parents are keeping her to be his bride; like to that star\nthe hero trod the way to the city.  And when they had passed\nwithin the gates and the city, the women of the people surged\nbehind them, delighting in the stranger, but he with his eyes\nfixed on the ground fared straight on, till he reached the\nglorious palace of Hypsipyle; and when he appeared the maids\nopened the folding doors, fitted with well-fashioned panels. \nHere Iphinoe leading him quickly through a fair porch set him\nupon a shining seat opposite her mistress, but Hypsipyle turned\nher eyes aside and a blush covered her maiden cheeks, yet for all\nher modesty she addressed him with crafty words:",
        "(ll. 793-833)  “Stranger, why stay ye so long outside our towers?\nfor the city is not inhabited by the men, but they, as\nsojourners, plough the wheat-bearing fields of the Thracian\nmainland.  And I will tell out truly all our evil plight, that ye\nyourselves too may know it well.  When my father Thoas reigned\nover the citizens, then our folk starting from their homes used\nto plunder from their ships the dwellings of the Thracians who\nlive opposite, and they brought back hither measureless booty and\nmaidens too.  But the counsel of the baneful goddess Cypris was\nworking out its accomplishment, who brought upon them soul\ndestroying infatuation.  For they hated their lawful wives, and,\nyielding to their own mad folly, drove them from their homes; and\nthey took to their beds the captives of their spear, cruel ones.\nLong in truth we endured it, if haply again, though late, they\nmight change their purpose, but ever the bitter woe grew,\ntwofold.  And the lawful children were being dishonoured in their\nhalls, and a bastard race was rising.  And thus unmarried maidens\nand widowed mothers too wandered uncared for through the city; no\nfather heeded his daughter ever so little even though he should\nsee her done to death before his eyes at the hands of an insolent\nstep-dame, nor did sons, as before, defend their mother against\nunseemly outrage; nor did brothers care at heart for their\nsister.  But in their homes, in the dance, in the assembly and\nthe banquet all their thought was only for their captive maidens;\nuntil some god put desperate courage in our hearts no more to\nreceive our lords on their return from Thrace within our towers\nso that they might either heed the right or might depart and\nbegone elsewhither, they and their captives.  So they begged of\nus all the male children that were left in the city and went back\nto where even now they dwell on the snowy tilths of Thrace.  Do\nye therefore stay and settle with us; and shouldst thou desire to\ndwell here, and this finds favour with thee, assuredly thou shalt\nhave the prerogative of my father Thoas; and I deem that thou\nwilt not scorn our land at all; for it is deepsoiled beyond all\nother islands that lie in the Aegaean sea.  But come now, return\nto the ship and relate my words to thy comrades, and stay not\noutside our city.”",
        "(ll. 834-835)  She spoke, glozing over the murder that had been\nwrought upon the men; and Jason addressed her in answer:",
        "(ll. 836-841)  “Hypsipyle, very dear to our hearts is the help we\nshall meet with, which thou grantest to us who need thee.  And I\nwill return again to the city when I have told everything in\norder due.  But let the sovereignty of the island be thine; it is\nnot in scorn I yield it up, but grievous trials urge me on.”",
        "(ll. 842-852)  He spake, and touched her right hand; and quickly\nhe turned to go back: and round him the young maids on every side\ndanced in countless numbers in their joy till he passed through\nthe gates.  And then they came to the shore in smooth-running\nwains, bearing with them many gifts, when now he had related from\nbeginning to end the speech which Hypsipyle had spoken when she\nsummoned them; and the maids readily led the men back to their\nhomes for entertainment.  For Cypris stirred in them a sweet\ndesire, for the sake of Hephaestus of many counsels, in order\nthat Lemnos might be again inhabited by men and not be ruined.",
        "(ll. 853-864)  Thereupon Aeson’s son started to go to the royal\nhome of Hypsipyle; and the rest went each his way as chance took\nthem, all but Heracles; for he of his own will was left behind by\nthe ship and a few chosen comrades with him.  And straightway the\ncity rejoiced with dances and banquets, being filled with the\nsteam of sacrifice; and above all the immortals they propitiated\nwith songs and sacrifices the illustrious son of Hera and Cypris\nherself.  And the sailing was ever delayed from one day to\nanother; and long would they have lingered there, had not\nHeracles, gathering together his comrades apart from the women,\nthus addressed them with reproachful words:",
        "(ll. 865-874)  “Wretched men, does the murder of kindred keep us\nfrom our native land?  Or is it in want of marriage that we have\ncome hither from thence, in scorn of our countrywomen?  Does it\nplease us to dwell here and plough the rich soil of Lemnos?  No\nfair renown shall we win by thus tarrying so long with stranger\nwomen; nor will some god seize and give us at our prayer a fleece\nthat moves of itself.  Let us then return each to his own; but\nhim leave ye to rest all day long in the embrace of Hypsipyle\nuntil he has peopled Lemnos with men-children, and so there come\nto him great glory.”",
        "(ll. 875-887)  Thus did he chide the band; but no one dared to\nmeet his eye or to utter a word in answer.  But just as they were\nin the assembly they made ready their departure in all haste, and\nthe women came running towards them, when they knew their intent.\nAnd as when bees hum round fair lilies pouring forth from their\nhive in the rock, and all around the dewy meadow rejoices, and\nthey gather the sweet fruit, flitting from one to another; even\nso the women eagerly poured forth clustering round the men with\nloud lament, and greeted each one with hands and voice, praying\nthe blessed gods to grant him a safe return.  And so Hypsipyle\ntoo prayed, seizing the hands of Aeson’s son, and her tears\nflowed for the loss of her lover:",
        "(ll. 888-898)  “Go, and may heaven bring thee back again with thy\ncomrades unharmed, bearing to the king the golden fleece, even as\nthou wilt and thy heart desireth; and this island and my father’s\nsceptre will be awaiting thee, if on thy return hereafter thou\nshouldst choose to come hither again; and easily couldst thou\ngather a countless host of men from other cities. But thou wilt\nnot have this desire, nor do I myself forbode that so it will be. \nStill remember Hypsipyle when thou art far away and when thou\nhast returned; and leave me some word of bidding, which I will\ngladly accomplish, if haply heaven shall grant me to be a\nmother.”",
        "(ll. 899-909)  And Aeson’s son in admiration thus replied:\n\"Hypsipyle, so may all these things prove propitious by the\nfavour of the blessed gods.  But do thou hold a nobler thought of\nme, since by the grace of Pelias it is enough for me to dwell in\nmy native land; may the gods only release me from my toils.  But\nif it is not my destiny to sail afar and return to the land of\nHellas, and if thou shouldst bear a male child, send him when\ngrown up to Pelasgian Iolcus, to heal the grief of my father and\nmother if so be that he find them still living, in order that,\nfar away from the king, they may be cared for by their own hearth\nin their home.”",
        "(ll. 910-921) He spake, and mounted the ship first of all; and so\nthe rest of the chiefs followed, and, sitting in order, seized\nthe oars; and Argus loosed for them the hawsers from under the\nsea-beaten rock.  Whereupon they mightily smote the water with\ntheir long oars, and in the evening by the injunctions of Orpheus\nthey touched at the island of Electra, (5) daughter of Atlas, in\norder that by gentle initiation they might learn the rites that\nmay not be uttered, and so with greater safety sail over the\nchilling sea.  Of these I will make no further mention; but I bid\nfarewell to the island itself and the indwelling deities, to whom\nbelong those mysteries, which it is not lawful for me to sing.",
        "(ll. 922-935)  Thence did they row with eagerness over the depths\nof the black Sea, having on the one side the land of the\nThracians, on the other Imbros on the south; and as the sun was\njust setting they reached the foreland of the Chersonesus.  There\na strong south wind blew for them; and raising the sails to the\nbreeze they entered the swift stream of the maiden daughter of\nAthamas; and at dawn the sea to the north was left behind and at\nnight they were coasting inside the Rhoeteian shore, with the\nland of Ida on their right.  And leaving Dardania they directed\ntheir course to Abydus, and after it they sailed past Percote and\nthe sandy beach of Abarnis and divine Pityeia.  And in that\nnight, as the ship sped on by sail and oar, they passed right\nthrough the Hellespont dark-gleaming with eddies.",
        "(ll. 936-960)  There is a lofty island inside the Propontis, a\nshort distance from the Phrygian mainland with its rich\ncornfields, sloping to the sea, where an isthmus in front of the\nmainland is flooded by the waves, so low does it lie.  And the\nisthmus has double shores, and they lie beyond the river Aesepus,\nand the inhabitants round about call the island the Mount of\nBears.  And insolent and fierce men dwell there, Earthborn, a\ngreat marvel to the neighbours to behold; for each one has six\nmighty hands to lift up, two from his sturdy shoulders, and four\nbelow, fitting close to his terrible sides.  And about the\nisthmus and the plain the Doliones had their dwelling, and over\nthem Cyzicus son of Aeneus was king, whom Aenete the daughter of\ngoodly Eusorus bare.  But these men the Earthborn monsters,\nfearful though they were, in nowise harried, owing to the\nprotection of Poseidon; for from him had the Doliones first\nsprung.  Thither Argo pressed on, driven by the winds of Thrace,\nand the Fair haven received her as she sped.  There they cast\naway their small anchorstone by the advice of Tiphys and left it\nbeneath a fountain, the fountain of Artaeie; and they took\nanother meet for their purpose, a heavy one; but the first,\naccording to the oracle of the Far-Darter, the Ionians, sons of\nNeleus, in after days laid to be a sacred stone, as was right, in\nthe temple of Jasonian Athena.",
        "(ll. 961-988)  Now the Doliones and Cyzicus himself all came\ntogether to meet them with friendliness, and when they knew of\nthe quest and their lineage welcomed them with hospitality, and\npersuaded them to row further and to fasten their ship’s hawsers\nat the city harbour.  Here they built an altar to Ecbasian Apollo\n(6) and set it up on the beach, and gave heed to sacrifices.  And\nthe king of his own bounty gave them sweet wine and sheep in\ntheir need; for he had heard a report that whenever a godlike\nband of heroes should come, straightway he should meet it with\ngentle words and should have no thought of war.  As with Jason,\nthe soft down was just blooming on his chin, nor yet had it been\nhis lot to rejoice in children, but still in his palace his wife\nwas untouched by the pangs of child-birth, the daughter of\nPercosian Merops, fair-haired Cleite, whom lately by priceless\ngifts he had brought from her father’s home from the mainland\nopposite.  But even so he left his chamber and bridal bed and\nprepared a banquet among the strangers, casting all fears from\nhis heart.  And they questioned one another in turn.  Of them\nwould he learn the end of their voyage and the injunctions of\nPelias; while they enquired about the cities of the people round\nand all the gulf of the wide Propontis; but further he could not\ntell them for all their desire to learn.  In the morning they\nclimbed mighty Dindymum that they might themselves behold the\nvarious paths of that sea; and they brought their ship from its\nformer anchorage to the harbour, Chytus; and the path they trod\nis named the path of Jason.",
        "(ll. 989-1011)  But the Earthborn men on the other side rushed\ndown from the mountain and with crags below blocked up the mouth\nof vast Chytus towards the sea, like men lying in wait for a wild\nbeast within.  But there Heracles had been left behind with the\nyounger heroes and he quickly bent his back-springing bow against\nthe monsters and brought them to earth one after another; and\nthey in their turn raised huge ragged rocks and hurled them.  For\nthese dread monsters too, I ween, the goddess Hera, bride of\nZeus, had nurtured to be a trial for Heracles.  And therewithal\ncame the rest of the martial heroes returning to meet the foe\nbefore they reached the height of outlook, and they fell to the\nslaughter of the Earthborn, receiving them with arrows and spears\nuntil they slew them all as they rushed fiercely to battle.  And\nas when woodcutters cast in rows upon the beach long trees just\nhewn down by their axes, in order that, once sodden with brine,\nthey may receive the strong bolts; so these monsters at the\nentrance of the foam-fringed harbour lay stretched one after\nanother, some in heaps bending their heads and breasts into the\nsalt waves with their limbs spread out above on the land; others\nagain were resting their heads on the sand of the shore and their\nfeet in the deep water, both alike a prey to birds and fishes at\nonce.",
        "(ll. 1012-1076)  But the heroes, when the contest was ended\nwithout fear, loosed the ship’s hawsers to the breath of the wind\nand pressed on through the sea-swell.  And the ship sped on under\nsail all day; but when night came the rushing wind did not hold\nsteadfast, but contrary blasts caught them and held them back\ntill they again approached the hospitable Doliones.  And they\nstepped ashore that same night; and the rock is still called the\nSacred Rock round which they threw the ship’s hawsers in their\nhaste.  Nor did anyone note with care that it was the same\nisland; nor in the night did the Doliones clearly perceive that\nthe heroes were returning; but they deemed that Pelasgian war-men\nof the Macrians had landed.  Therefore they donned their armour\nand raised their hands against them.  And with clashing of ashen\nspears and shields they fell on each other, like the swift rush\nof fire which falls on dry brushwood and rears its crest; and the\ndin of battle, terrible and furious, fell upon the people of the\nDoliones.  Nor was the king to escape his fate and return home\nfrom battle to his bridal chamber and bed.  But Aeson’s son leapt\nupon him as he turned to face him, and smote him in the middle of\nthe breast, and the bone was shattered round the spear; he rolled\nforward in the sand and filled up the measure of his fate.  For\nthat no mortal may escape; but on every side a wide snare\nencompasses us.  And so, when he thought that he had escaped\nbitter death from the chiefs, fate entangled him that very night\nin her toils while battling with them; and many champions withal\nwere slain; Heracles killed Telecles and Megabrontes, and Acastus\nslew Sphodris; and Peleus slew Zelus and Gephyrus swift in war.\nTelamon of the strong spear slew Basileus.  And Idas slew\nPromeus, and Clytius Hyacinthus, and the two sons of Tyndareus\nslew Megalossaces and Phlogius.  And after them the son of Oeneus\nslew bold Itomeneus, and Artaceus, leader of men; all of whom the\ninhabitants still honour with the worship due to heroes.  And the\nrest gave way and fled in terror just as doves fly in terror\nbefore swift-winged hawks.  And with a din they rustled in a body\nto the gates; and quickly the city was filled with loud cries at\nthe turning of the dolorous fight.  But at dawn both sides\nperceived the fatal and cureless error; and bitter grief seized\nthe Minyan heroes when they saw before them Cyzicus son of Aeneus\nfallen in the midst of dust and blood.  And for three whole days\nthey lamented and rent their hair, they and the Dollones.  Then\nthree times round his tomb they paced in armour of bronze and\nperformed funeral rites and celebrated games, as was meet, upon\nthe meadow-plain, where even now rises the mound of his grave to\nbe seen by men of a later day.  No, nor was his bride Cleite left\nbehind her dead husband, but to crown the ill she wrought an ill\nyet more awful, when she clasped a noose round her neck.  Her\ndeath even the nymphs of the grove bewailed; and of all the tears\nfor her that they shed to earth from their eyes the goddesses\nmade a fountain, which they call Cleite, (7) the illustrious name\nof the hapless maid.  Most terrible came that day from Zeus upon\nthe Doliones, women and men; for no one of them dared even to\ntaste food, nor for a long time by reason of grief did they take\nthought for the toil of the cornmill, but they dragged on their\nlives eating their food as it was, untouched by fire.  Here even\nnow, when the Ionians that dwell in Cyzicus pour their yearly\nlibations for the dead, they ever grind the meal for the\nsacrificial cakes at the common mill. (8)",
        "(ll. 1079-1091)  After this, fierce tempests arose for twelve\ndays and nights together and kept them there from sailing.  But\nin the next night the rest of the chieftains, overcome by sleep,\nwere resting during the latest period of the night, while Acastus\nand Mopsus the son of Ampyeus kept guard over their deep\nslumbers.  And above the golden head of Aeson’s son there hovered\na halcyon prophesying with shrill voice the ceasing of the stormy\nwinds; and Mopsus heard and understood the cry of the bird of the\nshore, fraught with good omen.  And some god made it turn aside,\nand flying aloft it settled upon the stern-ornament of the ship.\nAnd the seer touched Jason as he lay wrapped in soft sheepskins\nand woke him at once, and thus spake:",
        "(ll. 1092-1102)  “Son of Aeson, thou must climb to this temple on\nrugged Dindymum and propitiate the mother (9) of all the blessed\ngods on her fair throne, and the stormy blasts shall cease.  For\nsuch was the voice I heard but now from the halcyon, bird of the\nsea, which, as it flew above thee in thy slumber, told me all. \nFor by her power the winds and the sea and all the earth below\nand the snowy seat of Olympus are complete; and to her, when from\nthe mountains she ascends the mighty heaven, Zeus himself, the\nson of Cronos, gives place.  In like manner the rest of the\nimmortal blessed ones reverence the dread goddess.”",
        "(ll. 1103-1152)  Thus he spake, and his words were welcome to\nJason’s ear.  And he arose from his bed with joy and woke all his\ncomrades hurriedly and told them the prophecy of Mopsus the son\nof Ampycus.  And quickly the younger men drove oxen from their\nstalls and began to lead them to the mountain’s lofty summit. \nAnd they loosed the hawsers from the sacred rock and rowed to the\nThracian harbour; and the heroes climbed the mountain, leaving a\nfew of their comrades in the ship.  And to them the Macrian\nheights and all the coast of Thrace opposite appeared to view\nclose at hand.  And there appeared the misty mouth of Bosporus\nand the Mysian hills; and on the other side the stream of the\nriver Aesepus and the city and Nepeian plain of Adrasteia.  Now\nthere was a sturdy stump of vine that grew in the forest, a tree\nexceeding old; this they cut down, to be the sacred image of the\nmountain goddess; and Argus smoothed it skilfully, and they set\nit upon that rugged hill beneath a canopy of lofty oaks, which of\nall trees have their roots deepest.  And near it they heaped an\naltar of small stones, and wreathed their brows with oak leaves\nand paid heed to sacrifice, invoking the mother of Dindymum, most\nvenerable, dweller in Phrygia, and Titias and Cyllenus, who alone\nof many are called dispensers of doom and assessors of the Idaean\nmother,–the Idaean Dactyls of Crete, whom once the nymph\nAnchiale, as she grasped with both hands the land of Oaxus, bare\nin the Dictaean cave.  And with many prayers did Aeson’s son\nbeseech the goddess to turn aside the stormy blasts as he poured\nlibations on the blazing sacrifice; and at the same time by\ncommand of Orpheus the youths trod a measure dancing in full\narmour, and clashed with their swords on their shields, so that\nthe ill-omened cry might be lost in the air the wail which the\npeople were still sending up in grief for their king.  Hence from\nthat time forward the Phrygians propitiate Rhea with the wheel\nand the drum.  And the gracious goddess, I ween, inclined her\nheart to pious sacrifices; and favourable signs appeared.  The\ntrees shed abundant fruit, and round their feet the earth of its\nown accord put forth flowers from the tender grass.  And the\nbeasts of the wild wood left their lairs and thickets and came up\nfawning on them with their tails.  And she caused yet another\nmarvel; for hitherto there was no flow of water on Dindymum, but\nthen for them an unceasing stream gushed forth from the thirsty\npeak just as it was, and the dwellers around in after times\ncalled that stream, the spring of Jason.  And then they made a\nfeast in honour of the goddess on the Mount of Bears, singing the\npraises of Rhea most venerable; but at dawn the winds had ceased\nand they rowed away from the island.",
        "(ll. 1153-1171)  Thereupon a spirit of contention stirred each\nchieftain, who should be the last to leave his oar.  For all\naround the windless air smoothed the swirling waves and lulled\nthe sea to rest.  And they, trusting in the calm, mightily drove\nthe ship forward; and as she sped through the salt sea, not even\nthe storm-footed steeds of Poseidon would have overtaken her. \nNevertheless when the sea was stirred by violent blasts which\nwere just rising from the rivers about evening, forspent with\ntoil, they ceased.  But Heracles by the might of his arms pulled\nthe weary rowers along all together, and made the strong-knit\ntimbers of the ship to quiver.  But when, eager to reach the\nMysian mainland, they passed along in sight of the mouth of\nRhyndaeus and the great cairn of Aegaeon, a little way from\nPhrygia, then Heracles, as he ploughed up the furrows of the\nroughened surge, broke his oar in the middle.  And one half he\nheld in both his hands as he fell sideways, the other the sea\nswept away with its receding wave.  And he sat up in silence\nglaring round; for his hands were unaccustomed to he idle.",
        "(ll. 1172-1186)  Now at the hour when from the field some delver\nor ploughman goes gladly home to his hut, longing for his evening\nmeal, and there on the threshold, all squalid with dust, bows his\nwearied knees, and, beholding his hands worn with toil, with many\na curse reviles his belly; at that hour the heroes reached the\nhomes of the Cianian land near the Arganthonian mount and the\noutfall of Cius.  Them as they came in friendliness, the Mysians,\ninhabitants of that land, hospitably welcomed, and gave them in\ntheir need provisions and sheep and abundant wine.  Hereupon some\nbrought dried wood, others from the meadows leaves for beds which\nthey gathered in abundance for strewing, whilst others were\ntwirling sticks to get fire; others again were mixing wine in the\nbowl and making ready the feast, after sacrificing at nightfall\nto Apollo Ecbasius.",
        "(ll. 1187-1206)  But the son of Zeus having duly enjoined on his\ncomrades to prepare the feast took his way into a wood, that he\nmight first fashion for himself an oar to fit his hand. \nWandering about he found a pine not burdened with many branches,\nnor too full of leaves, but like to the shaft of a tall poplar;\nso great was it both in length and thickness to look at.  And\nquickly he laid on the ground his arrow-holding quiver together\nwith his bow, and took off his lion’s skin.  And he loosened the\npine from the ground with his bronze-tipped club and grasped the\ntrunk with both hands at the bottom, relying on his strength; and\nhe pressed it against his broad shoulder with legs wide apart;\nand clinging close he raised it from the ground deep-rooted\nthough it was, together with clods of earth.  And as when\nunexpectedly, just at the time of the stormy setting of baleful\nOrion, a swift gust of wind strikes down from above, and wrenches\na ship’s mast from its stays, wedges and all; so did Heracles\nlift the pine.  And at the same time he took up his bow and\narrows, his lion skin and club, and started on his return.",
        "(ll. 1207-1239)  Meantime Hylas with pitcher of bronze in hand\nhad gone apart from the throng, seeking the sacred flow of a\nfountain, that he might be quick in drawing water for the evening\nmeal and actively make all things ready in due order against his\nlord’s return.  For in such ways did Heracles nurture him from\nhis first childhood when he had carried him off from the house of\nhis father, goodly Theiodamas, whom the hero pitilessly slew\namong the Dryopians because he withstood him about an ox for the\nplough.  Theiodamas was cleaving with his plough the soil of\nfallow land when he was smitten with the curse; and Heracles bade\nhim give up the ploughing ox against his will.  For he desired to\nfind some pretext for war against the Dryopians for their bane,\nsince they dwelt there reckless of right.  But these tales would\nlead me far astray from my song.  And quickly Hylas came to the\nspring which the people who dwell thereabouts call Pegae.  And\nthe dances of the nymphs were just now being held there; for it\nwas the care of all the nymphs that haunted that lovely headland\never to hymn Artemis in songs by night.  All who held the\nmountain peaks or glens, all they were ranged far off guarding\nthe woods; but one, a water-nymph was just rising from the\nfair-flowing spring; and the boy she perceived close at hand with\nthe rosy flush of his beauty and sweet grace.  For the full moon\nbeaming from the sky smote him.  And Cypris made her heart faint,\nand in her confusion she could scarcely gather her spirit back to\nher.  But as soon as he dipped the pitcher in the stream, leaning\nto one side, and the brimming water rang loud as it poured\nagainst the sounding bronze, straightway she laid her left arm\nabove upon his neck yearning to kiss his tender mouth; and with\nher right hand she drew down his elbow, and plunged him into the\nmidst of the eddy.",
        "(ll. 1240-1256)  Alone of his comrades the hero Polyphemus, son\nof Eilatus, as he went forward on the path, heard the boy’s cry,\nfor he expected the return of mighty Heracles.  And he rushed\nafter the cry, near Pegae, like some beast of the wild wood whom\nthe bleating of sheep has reached from afar, and burning with\nhunger he follows, but does not fall in with the flocks; for the\nshepherds beforehand have penned them in the fold, but he groans\nand roars vehemently until he is weary.  Thus vehemently at that\ntime did the son of Eilatus groan and wandered shouting round the\nspot; and his voice rang piteous.  Then quickly drawing his great\nsword he started in pursuit, in fear lest the boy should be the\nprey of wild beasts, or men should have lain in ambush for him\nfaring all alone, and be carrying him off, an easy prey. \nHereupon as he brandished his bare sword in his hand he met\nHeracles himself on the path, and well he knew him as he hastened\nto the ship through the darkness.  And straightway he told the\nwretched calamity while his heart laboured with his panting\nbreath.",
        "(ll. 1257-1260)  “My poor friend, I shall be the first to bring\nthee tidings of bitter woe.  Hylas has gone to the well and has\nnot returned safe, but robbers have attacked and are carrying him\noff, or beasts are tearing him to pieces; I heard his cry.”",
        "(ll. 1261-1272)  Thus he spake; and when Heracles heard his\nwords, sweat in abundance poured down from his temples and the\nblack blood boiled beneath his heart.  And in wrath he hurled the\npine to the ground and hurried along the path whither his feet\nbore on his impetuous soul.  And as when a bull stung by a gadfly\ntears along, leaving the meadows and the marsh land, and recks\nnot of herdsmen or herd, but presses on, now without cheek, now\nstanding still, and raising his broad neck he bellows loudly,\nstung by the maddening fly; so he in his frenzy now would ply his\nswift knees unresting, now again would cease from toil and shout\nafar with loud pealing cry.",
        "(ll. 1273-1289)  But straightway the morning star rose above the\ntopmost peaks and the breeze swept down; and quickly did Tiphys\nurge them to go aboard and avail themselves of the wind.  And\nthey embarked eagerly forthwith; and they drew up the ship’s\nanchors and hauled the ropes astern.  And the sails were bellied\nout by the wind, and far from the coast were they joyfully borne\npast the Posideian headland.  But at the hour when gladsome dawn\nshines from heaven, rising from the east, and the paths stand out\nclearly, and the dewy plains shine with a bright gleam, then at\nlength they were aware that unwittingly they had abandoned those\nmen.  And a fierce quarrel fell upon them, and violent tumult,\nfor that they had sailed and left behind the bravest of their\ncomrades.  And Aeson’s son, bewildered by their hapless plight,\nsaid never a word, good or bad; but sat with his heavy load of\ngrief, eating out his heart.  And wrath seized Telamon, and thus\nhe spake:",
        "(ll. 1290-1295)  “Sit there at thy ease, for it was fitting for\nthee to leave Heracles behind; from thee the project arose, so\nthat his glory throughout Hellas should not overshadow thee, if\nso be that heaven grants us a return home.  But what pleasure is\nthere in words?  For I will go, I only, with none of thy\ncomrades, who have helped thee to plan this treachery.”",
        "(ll. 1296-1314)  He spake, and rushed upon Tiphys son of Hagnias;\nand his eyes sparkled like flashes of ravening flame.  And they\nwould quickly have turned back to the land of the Mysians,\nforcing their way through the deep sea and the unceasing blasts\nof the wind, had not the two sons of Thracian Boreas held back\nthe son of Aeacus with harsh words.  Hapless ones, assuredly a\nbitter vengeance came upon them thereafter at the hands of\nHeracles, because they stayed the search for him.  For when they\nwere returning from the games over Pelias dead he slew them in\nsea-girt Tenos and heaped the earth round them, and placed two\ncolumns above, one of which, a great marvel for men to see, moves\nat the breath of the blustering north wind.  These things were\nthus to be accomplished in after times.  But to them appeared\nGlaucus from the depths of the sea, the wise interpreter of\ndivine Nereus, and raising aloft his shaggy head and chest from\nhis waist below, with sturdy hand he seized the ship’s keel, and\nthen cried to the eager crew:",
        "(ll. 1315-1325)  “Why against the counsel of mighty Zeus do ye\npurpose to lead bold Heracles to the city of Aeetes?  At Argos it\nis his fate to labour for insolent Eurystheus and to accomplish\nfull twelve toils and dwell with the immortals, if so be that he\nbring to fulfilment a few more yet; wherefore let there be no\nvain regret for him.  Likewise it is destined for Polyphemus to\nfound a glorious city at the mouth of Cius among the Mysians and\nto fill up the measure of his fate in the vast land of the\nChalybes.  But a goddess-nymph through love has made Hylas her\nhusband, on whose account those two wandered and were left\nbehind.”",
        "(ll. 1326-1331)  He spake, and with a plunge wrapped him about\nwith the restless wave; and round him the dark water foamed in\nseething eddies and dashed against the hollow ship as it moved\nthrough the sea.  And the heroes rejoiced, and Telamon son of\nAeacus came in haste to Jason, and grasping his hand in his own\nembraced him with these words:",
        "(ll. 1332-1335)  “Son of Aeson, be not wroth with me, if in my\nfolly I have erred, for grief wrought upon me to utter a word\narrogant and intolerable.  But let me give my fault to the winds\nand let our hearts be joined as before.”",
        "(ll. 1336-1343)  Him the son of Aeson with prudence addressed:\n\"Good friend, assuredly with an evil word didst thou revile me,\nsaying before them all that I was the wronger of a kindly man.\nBut not for long will I nurse bitter wrath, though indeed before\nI was grieved.  For it was not for flocks of sheep, no, nor for\npossessions that thou wast angered to fury, but for a man, thy\ncomrade.  And I were fain thou wouldst even champion me against\nanother man if a like thing should ever befall me.”",
        "(ll. 1344-1357)  He spake, and they sat down, united as of old.\nBut of those two, by the counsel of Zeus, one, Polyphemus son of\nEilatus, was destined to found and build a city among the Mysians\nbearing the river’s name, and the other, Heracles, to return and\ntoil at the labours of Eurystheus.  And he threatened to lay\nwaste the Mysian land at once, should they not discover for him\nthe doom of Hylas, whether living or dead.  And for him they gave\npledges choosing out the noblest sons of the people and took an\noath that they would never cease from their labour of search.\nTherefore to this day the people of Cius enquire for Hylas the\nson of Theiodamas, and take thought for the well-built Trachis.\nFor there did Heracles settle the youths whom they sent from Cius\nas pledges.",
        "(ll. 1358-1362)  And all day long and all night the wind bore the\nship on, blowing fresh and strong; but when dawn rose there was\nnot even a breath of air.  And they marked a beach jutting forth\nfrom a bend of the coast, very broad to behold, and by dint of\nrowing came to land at sunrise.",
        "ENDNOTES:\n(1)  i.e. God of embarcation.\n(2)  Or, reading EKTOTHEN, “they strongly girded the ship outside\n     with a well-twisted rope.”  In either case there is probably\n     no allusion to YPOZOMATA (ropes for undergirding) which were\n     carried loose and only used in stormy weather.\n(3)  i.e. God of the shore.\n(4)  i.e. The Starting.\n(5)  Samothrace.\n(6)  i.e. god of disembarcation.\n(7)  Cleite means illustrious.\n(8)  i.e. to avoid grinding it at home.\n(9)  Rhea.",
        "(ll. 1-10)  Here were the oxstalls and farm of Amycus, the\nhaughty king of the Bebrycians, whom once a nymph, Bithynian\nMelie, united to Poseidon Genethlius, bare the most arrogant of\nmen; for even for strangers he laid down an insulting ordinance,\nthat none should depart till they had made trial of him in\nboxing; and he had slain many of the neighbours.  And at that\ntime too he went down to the ship and in his insolence scorned to\nask them the occasion of their voyage, and who they were, but at\nonce spake out among them all:",
        "(ll. 11-18)  “Listen, ye wanderers by sea, to what it befits you\nto know.  It is the rule that no stranger who comes to the\nBebrycians should depart till he has raised his hands in battle\nagainst mine.  Wherefore select your bravest warrior from the\nhost and set him here on the spot to contend with me in boxing.\nBut if ye pay no heed and trample my decrees under foot,\nassuredly to your sorrow will stern necessity come upon you.",
        "(ll. 19-21)  Thus he spake in his pride, but fierce anger seized\nthem when they heard it, and the challenge smote Polydeuces most\nof all.  And quickly he stood forth his comrades’ champion, and\ncried:",
        "(ll. 22-24)  “Hold now, and display not to us thy brutal\nviolence, whoever thou art; for we will obey thy rules, as thou\nsayest.  Willingly now do I myself undertake to meet thee.”",
        "(ll. 25-54)  Thus he spake outright; but the other with rolling\neyes glared on him, like to a lion struck by a javelin when\nhunters in the mountains are hemming him round, and, though\npressed by the throng, he reeks no more of them, but keeps his\neyes fixed, singling out that man only who struck him first and\nslew him not.  Hereupon the son of Tyndareus laid aside his\nmantle, closely-woven, delicately-wrought, which one of the\nLemnian maidens had given him as a pledge of hospitality; and the\nking threw down his dark cloak of double fold with its clasps and\nthe knotted crook of mountain olive which he carried.  Then\nstraightway they looked and chose close by a spot that pleased\nthem and bade their comrades sit upon the sand in two lines; nor\nwere they alike to behold in form or in stature.  The one seemed\nto be a monstrous son of baleful Typhoeus or of Earth herself,\nsuch as she brought forth aforetime, in her wrath against Zeus;\nbut the other, the son of Tyndareus, was like a star of heaven,\nwhose beams are fairest as it shines through the nightly sky at\neventide.  Such was the son of Zeus, the bloom of the first down\nstill on his cheeks, still with the look of gladness in his eyes.\nBut his might and fury waxed like a wild beast’s; and he poised\nhis hands to see if they were pliant as before and were not\naltogether numbed by toil and rowing.  But Amycus on his side\nmade no trial; but standing apart in silence he kept his eyes\nupon his foe, and his spirit surged within him all eager to dash\nthe life-blood from his breast.  And between them Lyeoreus, the\nhenchman of Amycus, placed at their feet on each side two pairs\nof gauntlets made of raw hide, dry, exceeding tough.  And the\nking addressed the hero with arrogant words:",
        "(ll. 55-59)  “Whichever of these thou wilt, without casting lots,\nI grant thee freely, that thou mayst not blame me hereafter. \nBind them about thy hands; thou shalt learn and tell another how\nskilled I am to carve the dry oxhides and to spatter men’s cheeks\nwith blood.”",
        "(ll. 60-66)  Thus he spake; but the other gave back no taunt in\nanswer, but with a light smile readily took up the gauntlets that\nlay at his feet; and to him came Castor and mighty Talaus, son of\nBias, and they quickly bound the gauntlets about his hands, often\nbidding him be of good courage.  And to Amycus came Aretus and\nOrnytus, but little they knew, poor fools, that they had bound\nthem for the last time on their champion, a victim of evil fate.",
        "(ll. 67-97)  Now when they stood apart and were ready with their\ngauntlets, straightway in front of their faces they raised their\nheavy hands and matched their might in deadly strife.  Hereupon\nthe Bebrycian king even as a fierce wave of the sea rises in a\ncrest against a swift ship, but she by the skill of the crafty\npilot just escapes the shock when the billow is eager to break\nover the bulwark–so he followed up the son of Tyndareus,\ntrying to daunt him, and gave him no respite.  But the hero, ever\nunwounded, by his skill baffled the rush of his foe, and he\nquickly noted the brutal play of his fists to see where he was\ninvincible in strength, and where inferior, and stood unceasingly\nand returned blow for blow.  And as when shipwrights with their\nhammers smite ships’ timbers to meet the sharp clamps, fixing\nlayer upon layer; and the blows resound one after another; so\ncheeks and jaws crashed on both sides, and a huge clattering of\nteeth arose, nor did they cease ever from striking their blows\nuntil laboured gasping overcame both.  And standing a little\napart they wiped from their foreheads sweat in abundance, wearily\npanting for breath.  Then back they rushed together again, as two\nbulls fight in furious rivalry for a grazing heifer.  Next Amycus\nrising on tiptoe, like one who slays an ox, sprung to his full\nheight and swung his heavy hand down upon his rival; but the hero\nswerved aside from the rush, turning his head, and just received\nthe arm on his shoulder; and coming near and slipping his knee\npast the king’s, with a rush he struck him above the ear, and\nbroke the bones inside, and the king in agony fell upon his\nknees; and the Minyan heroes shouted for joy; and his life was\npoured forth all at once.",
        "(ll. 98-144)  Nor were the Bebrycians reckless of their king; but\nall together took up rough clubs and spears and rushed straight\non Polydeuces.  But in front of him stood his comrades, their\nkeen swords drawn from the sheath.  First Castor struck upon the\nhead a man as he rushed at him: and it was cleft in twain and\nfell on each side upon his shoulders.  And Polydeuces slew huge\nItymoneus and Mimas.  The one, with a sudden leap, he smote\nbeneath the breast with his swift foot and threw him in the dust;\nand as the other drew near he struck him with his right hand\nabove the left eyebrow, and tore away his eyelid and the eyeball\nwas left bare.  But Oreides, insolent henchman of Amycus, wounded\nTalaus son of Bias in the side, but did not slay him, but only\ngrazing the skin the bronze sped under his belt and touched not\nthe flesh.  Likewise Aretus with well-seasoned club smote\nIphitus, the steadfast son of Eurytus, not yet destined to an\nevil death; assuredly soon was he himself to be slain by the\nsword of Clytius.  Then Ancaeus, the dauntless son of Lycurgus,\nquickly seized his huge axe, and in his left hand holding a\nbear’s dark hide, plunged into the midst of the Bebrycians with\nfurious onset; and with him charged the sons of Aeacus, and with\nthem started warlike Jason.  And as when amid the folds grey\nwolves rush down on a winter’s day and scare countless sheep,\nunmarked by the keen-scented dogs and the shepherds too, and they\nseek what first to attack and carry off; often glaring around,\nbut the sheep are just huddled together and trample on one\nanother; so the heroes grievously scared the arrogant Bebrycians.\nAnd as shepherds or beekeepers smoke out a huge swarm of bees in\na rock, and they meanwhile, pent up in their hive, murmur with\ndroning hum, till, stupefied by the murky smoke, they fly forth\nfar from the rock; so they stayed steadfast no longer, but\nscattered themselves inland through Bebrycia, proclaiming the\ndeath of Amycus; fools, not to perceive that another woe all\nunforeseen was hard upon them.  For at that hour their vineyards\nand villages were being ravaged by the hostile spear of Lycus and\nthe Mariandyni, now that their king was gone.  For they were ever\nat strife about the ironbearing land.  And now the foe was\ndestroying their steadings and farms, and now the heroes from all\nsides were driving off their countless sheep, and one spake among\nhis fellows thus:",
        "(ll. 145-153)  “Bethink ye what they would have done in their\ncowardice if haply some god had brought Heracles hither.\nAssuredly, if he had been here, no trial would there have been of\nfists, I ween, but when the king drew near to proclaim his rules,\nthe club would have made him forget his pride and the rules to\nboot.  Yea, we left him uncared for on the strand and we sailed\noversea; and full well each one of us shall know our baneful\nfolly, now that he is far away.”",
        "(ll. 154-163)  Thus he spake, but all these things had been\nwrought by the counsels of Zeus.  Then they remained there\nthrough the night and tended the hurts of the wounded men, and\noffered sacrifice to the immortals, and made ready a mighty meal;\nand sleep fell upon no man beside the bowl and the blazing\nsacrifice.  They wreathed their fair brows with the bay that grew\nby the shore, whereto their hawsers were bound, and chanted a\nsong to the lyre of Orpheus in sweet harmony; and the windless\nshore was charmed by their song; and they celebrated the\nTherapnaean son of Zeus. (1)",
        "(ll. 164-177)  But when the sun rising from far lands lighted up\nthe dewy hills and wakened the shepherds, then they loosed their\nhawsers from the stem of the baytree and put on board all the\nspoil they had need to take; and with a favouring wind they\nsteered through the eddying Bosporus.  Hereupon a wave like a\nsteep mountain rose aloft in front as though rushing upon them,\never upheaved above the clouds; nor would you say that they could\nescape grim death, for in its fury it hangs over the middle of\nthe ship, like a cloud, yet it sinks away into calm if it meets\nwith a skilful helmsman.  So they by the steering-craft of Tiphys\nescaped, unhurt but sore dismayed.  And on the next day they\nfastened the hawsers to the coast opposite the Bithynian land.",
        "(ll. 178-208)  There Phineus, son of Agenor, had his home by the\nsea, Phineus who above all men endured most bitter woes because\nof the gift of prophecy which Leto’s son had granted him\naforetime.  And he reverenced not a whit even Zeus himself, for\nhe foretold unerringly to men his sacred will.  Wherefore Zeus\nsent upon him a lingering old age, and took from his eyes the\npleasant light, and suffered him not to have joy of the dainties\nuntold that the dwellers around ever brought to his house, when\nthey came to enquire the will of heaven.  But on a sudden,\nswooping through the clouds, the Harpies with their crooked beaks\nincessantly snatched the food away from his mouth and hands.  And\nat times not a morsel of food was left, at others but a little,\nin order that he might live and be tormented.  And they poured\nforth over all a loathsome stench; and no one dared not merely to\ncarry food to his mouth but even to stand at a distance; so\nfoully reeked the remnants of the meal.  But straightway when he\nheard the voice and the tramp of the band he knew that they were\nthe men passing by, at whose coming Zeus’ oracle had declared to\nhim that he should have joy of his food.  And he rose from his\ncouch, like a lifeless dream, bowed over his staff, and crept to\nthe door on his withered feet, feeling the walls; and as he\nmoved, his limbs trembled for weakness and age; and his parched\nskin was caked with dirt, and naught but the skill held his bones\ntogether.  And he came forth from the hall with wearied knees and\nsat on the threshold of the courtyard; and a dark stupor covered\nhim, and it seemed that the earth reeled round beneath his feet,\nand he lay in a strengthless trance, speechless.  But when they\nsaw him they gathered round and marvelled.  And he at last drew\nlaboured breath from the depths of his chest and spoke among them\nwith prophetic utterance:",
        "(ll. 209-239)  “Listen, bravest of all the Hellenes, if it be\ntruly ye, whom by a king’s ruthless command Jason is leading on\nthe ship Argo in quest of the fleece.  It is ye truly.  Even yet\nmy soul by its divination knows everything.  Thanks I render to\nthee, O king, son of Leto, plunged in bitter affliction though I\nbe.  I beseech you by Zeus the god of suppliants, the sternest\nfoe to sinful men, and for the sake of Phoebus and Hera herself,\nunder whose especial care ye have come hither, help me, save an\nill-fated man from misery, and depart not uncaring and leaving me\nthus as ye see.  For not only has the Fury set her foot on my\neyes and I drag on to the end a weary old age; but besides my\nother woes a woe hangs over me the bitterest of all.  The\nHarpies, swooping down from some unseen den of destruction, ever\nsnatch the food from my mouth.  And I have no device to aid me.\nBut it were easier, when I long for a meal, to escape my own\nthoughts than them, so swiftly do they fly through the air.  But\nif haply they do leave me a morsel of food it reeks of decay and\nthe stench is unendurable, nor could any mortal bear to draw near\neven for a moment, no, not if his heart were wrought of adamant.\nBut necessity, bitter and insatiate, compels me to abide and\nabiding to put food in my cursed belly.  These pests, the oracle\ndeclares, the sons of Boreas shall restrain.  And no strangers\nare they that shall ward them off if indeed I am Phineus who was\nonce renowned among men for wealth and the gift of prophecy, and\nif I am the son of my father Agenor; and, when I ruled among the\nThracians, by my bridal gifts I brought home their sister\nCleopatra to be my wife.”",
        "(ll. 240-243)  So spake Agenor’s son; and deep sorrow seized each\nof the heroes, and especially the two sons of Boreas.  And\nbrushing away a tear they drew nigh, and Zetes spake as follows,\ntaking in his own the hand of the grief-worn sire:",
        "(ll. 244-253)  “Unhappy one, none other of men is more wretched\nthan thou, methinks.  Why upon thee is laid the burden of so many\nsorrows?  Hast thou with baneful folly sinned against the gods\nthrough thy skill in prophecy?  For this are they greatly wroth\nwith thee?  Yet our spirit is dismayed within us for all our\ndesire to aid thee, if indeed the god has granted this privilege\nto us two.  For plain to discern to men of earth are the reproofs\nof the immortals.  And we will never check the Harpies when they\ncome, for all our desire, until thou hast sworn that for this we\nshall not lose the favour of heaven.”",
        "(ll. 254-255)  Thus he spake; and towards him the aged sire\nopened his sightless eyes, and lifted them up and replied with\nthese words:",
        "(ll. 256-261)  “Be silent, store not up such thoughts in thy\nheart, my child.  Let the son of Leto be my witness, he who of\nhis gracious will taught me the lore of prophecy, and be witness\nthe ill-starred doom which possesses me and this dark cloud upon\nmy eyes, and the gods of the underworld–and may their curse be\nupon me if I die perjured thus–no wrath from heaven will fall\nupon you two for your help to me.”",
        "(ll. 262-287)  Then were those two eager to help him because of\nthe oath.  And quickly the younger heroes prepared a feast for\nthe aged man, a last prey for the Harpies; and both stood near\nhim, to smite with the sword those pests when they swooped down.\nScarcely had the aged man touched the food when they forthwith,\nlike bitter blasts or flashes of lightning, suddenly darted from\nthe clouds, and swooped down with a yell, fiercely craving for\nfood; and the heroes beheld them and shouted in the midst of\ntheir onrush; but they at the cry devoured everything and sped\naway over the sea after; and an intolerable stench remained.  And\nbehind them the two sons of Boreas raising their swords rushed in\npursuit.  For Zeus imparted to them tireless strength; but\nwithout Zeus they could not have followed, for the Harpies used\never to outstrip the blasts of the west wind when they came to\nPhineus and when they left him.  And as when, upon the mountain-\nside, hounds, cunning in the chase, run in the track of horned\ngoats or deer, and as they strain a little behind gnash their\nteeth upon the edge of their jaws in vain; so Zetes and Calais\nrushing very near just grazed the Harpies in vain with their\nfinger-tips.  And assuredly they would have torn them to pieces,\ndespite heaven’s will, when they had overtaken them far off at\nthe Floating Islands, had not swift Iris seen them and leapt down\nfrom the sky from heaven above, and cheeked them with these\nwords:",
        "(ll. 288-290)  “It is not lawful, O sons of Boreas, to strike\nwith your swords the Harpies, the hounds of mighty Zeus; but I\nmyself will give you a pledge, that hereafter they shall not draw\nnear to Phineus.”",
        "(ll. 291-300)  With these words she took an oath by the waters of\nStyx, which to all the gods is most dread and most awful, that\nthe Harpies would never thereafter again approach the home of\nPhineus, son of Agenor, for so it was fated.  And the heroes\nyielding to the oath, turned back their flight to the ship.  And\non account of this men call them the Islands of Turning though\naforetime they called them the Floating Islands.  And the Harpies\nand Iris parted.  They entered their den in Minoan Crete; but she\nsped up to Olympus, soaring aloft on her swift wings.",
        "(ll. 301-310)  Meanwhile the chiefs carefully cleansed the old\nman’s squalid skin and with due selection sacrificed sheep which\nthey had borne away from the spoil of Amycus.  And when they had\nlaid a huge supper in the hall, they sat down and feasted, and\nwith them feasted Phineus ravenously, delighting his soul, as in\na dream.  And there, when they had taken their fill of food and\ndrink, they kept awake all night waiting for the sons of Boreas.\nAnd the aged sire himself sat in the midst, near the hearth,\ntelling of the end of their voyage and the completion of their\njourney:",
        "(ll. 311-315)  “Listen then.  Not everything is it lawful for you\nto know clearly; but whatever is heaven’s will, I will not hide.\nI was infatuated aforetime, when in my folly I declared the will\nof Zeus in order and to the end.  For he himself wishes to\ndeliver to men the utterances of the prophetic art incomplete, in\norder that they may still have some need to know the will of\nheaven.",
        "(ll. 316-340)  “First of all, after leaving me, ye will see the\ntwin Cyanean rocks where the two seas meet.  No one, I ween, has\nwon his escape between them.  For they are not firmly fixed with\nroots beneath, but constantly clash against one another to one\npoint, and above a huge mass of salt water rises in a crest,\nboiling up, and loudly dashes upon the hard beach.  Wherefore now\nobey my counsel, if indeed with prudent mind and reverencing the\nblessed gods ye pursue your way; and perish not foolishly by a\nself-sought death, or rush on following the guidance of youth.\nFirst entrust the attempt to a dove when ye have sent her forth\nfrom the ship.  And if she escapes safe with her wings between\nthe rocks to the open sea, then no more do ye refrain from the\npath, but grip your oars well in your hands and cleave the sea’s\nnarrow strait, for the light of safety will be not so much in\nprayer as in strength of hands.  Wherefore let all else go and\nlabour boldly with might and main, but ere then implore the gods\nas ye will, I forbid you not.  But if she flies onward and\nperishes midway, then do ye turn back; for it is better to yield\nto the immortals.  For ye could not escape an evil doom from the\nrocks, not even if Argo were of iron.",
        "(ll. 341-359)  “O hapless ones, dare not to transgress my divine\nwarning, even though ye think that I am thrice as much hated by\nthe sons of heaven as I am, and even more than thrice; dare not\nto sail further with your ship in despite of the omen.  And as\nthese things will fall, so shall they fall.  But if ye shun the\nclashing rocks and come scatheless inside Pontus, straightway\nkeep the land of the Bithynians on your right and sail on, and\nbeware of the breakers, until ye round the swift river Rhebas and\nthe black beach, and reach the harbour of the Isle of Thynias.\nThence ye must turn back a little space through the sea and beach\nyour ship on the land of the Mariandyni lying opposite.  Here is\na downward path to the abode of Hades, and the headland of\nAcherusia stretches aloft, and eddying Acheron cleaves its way at\nthe bottom, even through the headland, and sends its waters forth\nfrom a huge ravine.  And near it ye will sail past many hills of\nthe Paphlagonians, over whom at the first Eneteian Pelops\nreigned, and of his blood they boast themselves to be.",
        "(ll. 360-406)  “Now there is a headland opposite Helice the Bear,\nsteep on all sides, and they call it Carambis, about whose crests\nthe blasts of the north wind are sundered.  So high in the air\ndoes it rise turned towards the sea.  And when ye have rounded it\nbroad Aegialus stretches before you; and at the end of broad\nAegialus, at a jutting point of coast, the waters of the river\nHalys pour forth with a terrible roar; and after it his flowing\nnear, but smaller in stream, rolls into the sea with white\neddies.  Onward from thence the bend of a huge and towering cape\nreaches out from the land, next Thermodon at its mouth flows into\na quiet bay at the Themiscyreian headland, after wandering\nthrough a broad continent.  And here is the plain of Doeas, and\nnear are the three cities of the Amazons, and after them the\nChalybes, most wretched of men, possess a soil rugged and\nunyielding sons of toil, they busy themselves with working iron.\nAnd near them dwell the Tibareni, rich in sheep, beyond the\nGenetaean headland of Zeus, lord of hospitality.  And bordering\non it the Mossynoeci next in order inhabit the well-wooded\nmainland and the parts beneath the mountains, who have built in\ntowers made from trees their wooden homes and well-fitted\nchambers, which they call Mossynes, and the people themselves\ntake their name from them.  After passing them ye must beach your\nship upon a smooth island, when ye have driven away with all\nmanner of skill the ravening birds, which in countless numbers\nhaunt the desert island.  In it the Queens of the Amazons, Otrere\nand Antiope, built a stone temple of Ares what time they went\nforth to war.  Now here an unspeakable help will come to you from\nthe bitter sea; wherefore with kindly intent I bid you stay.  But\nwhat need is there that I should sin yet again declaring\neverything to the end by my prophetic art?  And beyond the island\nand opposite mainland dwell the Philyres: and above the Philyres\nare the Macrones, and after them the vast tribes of the Becheiri.\nAnd next in order to them dwell the Sapeires, and the Byzeres\nhave the lands adjoining to them, and beyond them at last live\nthe warlike Colchians themselves.  But speed on in your ship,\ntill ye touch the inmost bourne of the sea.  And here at the\nCytaean mainland and from the Amarantine mountains far away and\nthe Circaean plain, eddying Phasis rolls his broad stream to the\nsea.  Guide your ship to the mouth of that river and ye shall\nbehold the towers of Cytaean Aeetes and the shady grove of Ares,\nwhere a dragon, a monster terrible to behold, ever glares around,\nkeeping watch over the fleece that is spread upon the top of an\noak; neither by day nor by night does sweet sleep subdue his\nrestless eyes.”",
        "(ll. 408-410)  Thus he spake, and straightway fear seized them as\nthey heard.  And for a long while they were struck with silence;\ntill at last the hero, son of Aeson, spake, sore dismayed at\ntheir evil plight:",
        "(ll. 411-418)  “O aged sire, now hast thou come to the end of the\ntoils of our sea-journeying and hast told us the token, trusting\nto which we shall make our way to Pontus through the hateful\nrocks; but whether, when we have escaped them, we shall have a\nreturn back again to Hellas, this too would we gladly learn from\nthee.  What shall I do, how shall I go over again such a long\npath through the sea, unskilled as I am, with unskilled comrades?\nAnd Colchian Aea lies at the edge of Pontus and of the world.”",
        "(ll. 419-425)  Thus he spake, and him the aged sire addressed in\nreply: “O son, when once thou hast escaped through the deadly\nrocks, fear not; for a deity will be the guide from Aea by\nanother track; and to Aea there will be guides enough.  But, my\nfriends, take thought of the artful aid of the Cyprian goddess.\nFor on her depends the glorious issue of your venture.  And\nfurther than this ask me not.”",
        "(ll. 426-437)  Thus spake Agenor’s son, and close at hand the\ntwin sons of Thracian Boreas came darting from the sky and set\ntheir swift feet upon the threshold; and the heroes rose up from\ntheir seats when they saw them present.  And Zetes, still drawing\nhard breath after his toil, spake among the eager listeners,\ntelling them how far they had driven the Harpies and how his\nprevented their slaying them, and how the goddess of her grace\ngave them pledges, and how those others in fear plunged into the\nvast cave of the Dictaean cliff.  Then in the mansion all their\ncomrades were joyful at the tidings and so was Phineus himself.\nAnd quickly Aeson’s son, with good will exceeding, addressed him:",
        "(ll. 438-442)  Assuredly there was then, Phineus, some god who\ncared for thy bitter woe, and brought us hither from afar, that\nthe sons of Boreas might aid thee; and if too he should bring\nsight to thine eyes, verily I should rejoice, methinks, as much\nas if I were on my homeward way.”",
        "(ll. 443-447)  Thus he spake, but Phineus replied to him with\ndowncast look: “Son of Aeson, that is past recall, nor is there\nany remedy hereafter, for blasted are my sightless eyes.  But\ninstead of that, may the god grant me death at once, and after\ndeath I shall take my share in perfect bliss.”",
        "(ll. 448-467)  Then they two returned answering speech, each to\nother, and soon in the midst of their converse early dawn\nappeared; and round Phineus were gathered the neighbours who used\nto come thither aforetime day by day and constantly bring a\nportion of their food.  To all alike, however poor he was that\ncame, the aged man gave his oracles with good will, and freed\nmany from their woes by his prophetic art; wherefore they visited\nand tended him.  And with them came Paraebius, who was dearest to\nhim, and gladly did he perceive these strangers in the house. \nFor long ere now the seer himself had said that a band of\nchieftains, faring from Hellas to the city of Aceres, would make\nfast their hawsers to the Thynian land, and by Zeus’ will would\ncheck tho approach of the Harpies.  The rest the old man pleased\nwith words of wisdom and let them go; Paraebius only he bade\nremain there with the chiefs; and straightway he sent him and\nbade him bring back the choicest of his sheep.  And when he had\nleft the hall Phineus spake gently amid the throng of oarsmen:",
        "(ll. 468-489)  “O my friends, not all men are arrogant, it seems,\nnor unmindful of benefits.  Even as this man, loyal as he is,\ncame hither to learn his fate.  For when he laboured the most and\ntoiled the most, then the needs of life, ever growing more and\nmore, would waste him, and day after day ever dawned more\nwretched, nor was there any respite to his toil.  But he was\npaying the sad penalty of his father’s sin.  For he when alone on\nthe mountains, felling trees, once slighted the prayers of a\nHamadryad, who wept and sought to soften him with plaintive\nwords, not to cut down the stump of an oak tree coeval with\nherself, wherein for a long time she had lived continually; but\nhe in the arrogance of youth recklessly cut it down.  So to him\nthe nymph thereafter made her death a curse, to him and to his\nchildren.  I indeed knew of the sin when he came; and I bid him\nbuild an altar to the Thynian nymph, and offer on it an atoning\nsacrifice, with prayer to escape his father’s fate.  Here, ever\nsince he escaped the god-sent doom, never has he forgotten or\nneglected me; but sorely and against his will do I send him from\nmy doors, so eager is he to remain with me in my affliction.”",
        "(ll. 490-499)  Thus spake Agenor’s son; and his friend\nstraightway came near leading two sheep from the flock.  And up\nrose Jason and up rose the sons of Boreas at the bidding of the\naged sire . And quickly they called upon Apollo, lord of\nprophecy, and offered sacrifice upon the health as the day was\njust sinking.  And the younger comrades made ready a feast to\ntheir hearts’ desire.  Thereupon having well feasted they turned\nthemselves to rest, some near the ship’s hawsers, others in\ngroups throughout the mansion.  And at dawn the Etesian winds\nblew strongly, which by the command of Zeus blow over every land\nequally.",
        "(ll. 500-527)  Cyrene, the tale goes, once tended sheep along the\nmarsh-meadow of Peneus among men of old time; for dear to her\nwere maidenhood and a couch unstained.  But, as she guarded her\nflock by the river, Apollo carried her off far from Haemonia and\nplaced her among the nymphs of the land, who dwelt in Libya near\nthe Myrtosian height.  And here to Phoebus she bore Aristaeus\nwhom the Haemonians, rich in corn-land, call “Hunter” and\n\"Shepherd”.  Her, of his love, the god made a nymph there, of\nlong life and a huntress, and his son he brought while still an\ninfant to be nurtured in the cave of Cheiron.  And to him when he\ngrew to manhood the Muses gave a bride, and taught him the arts\nof healing and of prophecy; and they made him the keeper of their\nsheep, of all that grazed on the Athamantian plain of Phthia and\nround steep Othrys and the sacred stream of the river Apidanus.\nBut when from heaven Sirius scorched the Minoan Isles, and for\nlong there was no respite for the inhabitants, then by the\ninjunction of the Far-Darter they summoned Aristaeus to ward off\nthe pestilence.  And by his father’s command he left Phthia and\nmade his home in Ceos, and gathered together the Parrhasian\npeople who are of the lineage of Lycaon, and he built a great\naltar to Zeus Icmaeus, and duly offered sacrifices upon the\nmountains to that star Sirius, and to Zeus son of Cronos himself.\nAnd on this account it is that Etesian winds from Zeus cool the\nland for forty days, and in Ceos even now the priests offer\nsacrifices before the rising of the Dog-star.",
        "(ll. 528-536)  So the tale is told, but the chieftains stayed\nthere by constraint, and every day the Thynians, doing pleasure\nto Phineus, sent them gifts beyond measure.  And afterwards they\nraised an altar to the blessed twelve on the sea-beach opposite\nand laid offerings thereon and then entered their swift ship to\nrow, nor did they forget to bear with them a trembling dove; but\nEuphemus seized her and brought her all quivering with fear, and\nthey loosed the twin hawsers from the land.",
        "(ll. 537-548)  Nor did they start unmarked by Athena, but\nstraightway swiftly she set her feel on a light cloud, which\nwould waft her on, mighty though she was, and she swept on to the\nsea with friendly thoughts to the oarsmen.  And as when one\nroveth far from his native land, as we men often wander with\nenduring heart, nor is any land too distant but all ways are\nclear to his view, and he sees in mind his own home, and at once\nthe way over sea and land seems slain, and swiftly thinking, now\nthis way, now that, he strains with eager eyes; so swiftly the\ndaughter of Zeus darted down and set her foot on the cheerless\nshore of Thynia.",
        "(ll. 549-567)  Now when they reached the narrow strait of the\nwinding passage, hemmed in on both sides by rugged cliffs, while\nan eddying current from below was washing against the ship as she\nmoved on, they went forward sorely in dread; and now the thud of\nthe crashing rocks ceaselessly struck their ears, and the\nsea-washed shores resounded, and then Euphemus grasped the dove\nin his hand and started to mount the prow; and they, at the\nbidding of Tiphys, son of Hagnias, rowed with good will to drive\nArgo between the rocks, trusting to their strength.  And as they\nrounded a bend they saw the rocks opening for the last time of\nall.  Their spirit melted within them; and Euphemus sent forth\nthe dove to dart forward in flight; and they all together raised\ntheir heads to look; but she flew between them, and the rocks\nagain rushed together and crashed as they met face to face.  And\nthe foam leapt up in a mass like a cloud; awful was the thunder\nof the sea; and all round them the mighty welkin roared.",
        "(ll. 568-592)  The hollow caves beneath the rugged cliffs rumbled\nas the sea came surging in; and the white foam of the dashing\nwave spurted high above the cliff.  Next the current whirled the\nship round.  And the rocks shore away the end of the dove’s tail-\nfeathers; but away she flew unscathed.  And the rowers gave a\nloud cry; and Tiphys himself called to them to row with might and\nmain.  For the rocks were again parting asunder.  But as they\nrowed they trembled, until the tide returning drove them back\nwithin the rocks.  Then most awful fear seized upon all; for over\ntheir head was destruction without escape.  And now to right and\nleft broad Pontus was seen, when suddenly a huge wave rose up\nbefore them, arched, like a steep rock; and at the sight they\nbowed with bended heads.  For it seemed about to leap down upon\nthe ship’s whole length and to overwhelm them.  But Tiphys was\nquick to ease the ship as she laboured with the oars; and in all\nits mass the wave rolled away beneath the keel, and at the stern\nit raised Argo herself and drew her far away from the rocks; and\nhigh in air was she borne.  But Euphemus strode among all his\ncomrades and cried to them to bend to their oars with all their\nmight; and they with a shout smote the water.  And as far as the\nship yielded to the rowers, twice as far did she leap back, and\nthe oar, were bent like curved bows as the heroes used their\nstrength.",
        "(ll. 593-610) Then a vaulted billow rushed upon them, and the\nship like a cylinder ran on the furious wave plunging through the\nhollow sea.  And the eddying current held her between the\nclashing rocks; and on each side they shook and thundered; and\nthe ship’s timbers were held fast.  Then Athena with her left\nhand thrust back one mighty rock and with her right pushed the\nship through; and she, like a winged arrow, sped through the air.\nNevertheless the rocks, ceaselessly clashing, shore off as she\npassed the extreme end of the stern-ornament.  But Athena soared\nup to Olympus, when they had escaped unscathed.  And the rocks in\none spot at that moment were rooted fast for ever to each other,\nwhich thing had been destined by the blessed gods, when a man in\nhis ship should have passed between them alive.  And the heroes\nbreathed again after their chilling fear, beholding at the same\ntime the sky and the expanse of sea spreading far and wide.  For\nthey deemed that they were saved from Hades; and Tiphys first of\nall began to speak:",
        "(ll. 611-618) “It is my hope that we have safely escaped this\nperil–we, and the ship; and none other is the cause so much as\nAthena, who breathed into Argo divine strength when Argus knitted\nher together with bolts; and she may not be caught.  Son of\nAeson, no longer fear thou so much the hest of thy king, since a\ngod hath granted us escape between the rocks; for Phineus,\nAgenor’s son, said that our toils hereafter would be lightly\naccomplished.”",
        "(ll. 619-637)  He spake, and at once he sped the ship onward\nthrough the midst of the sea past the Bithynian coast.  But Jason\nwith gentle words addressed him in reply: “Tiphys, why dost thou\ncomfort thus my grieving heart?  I have erred and am distraught\nin wretched and helpless ruin.  For I ought, when Pelias gave the\ncommand, to have straightway refused this quest to his face, yea,\nthough I were doomed to die pitilessly, torn limb from limb, but\nnow I am wrapped in excessive fear and cares unbearable, dreading\nto sail through the chilling paths of the sea, and dreading when\nwe shall set foot on the mainland.  For on every side are\nunkindly men.  And ever when day is done I pass a night of groans\nfrom the time when ye first gathered together for my sake, while\nI take thought for all things; but thou talkest at thine ease,\neating only for thine own life; while for myself I am dismayed\nnot a whit; but I fear for this man and for that equally, and for\nthee, and for my other comrades, if I shall not bring you back\nsafe to the land of Hellas.”",
        "(ll. 638-640)  Thus he spake, making trial of the chiefs; but\nthey shouted loud with cheerful words.  And his heart was warmed\nwithin him at their cry and again he spake outright among them:",
        "(ll. 641-647)  “My friends, in your valour my courage is\nquickened.  Wherefore now, even though I should take my way\nthrough the gulfs of Hades, no more shall I let fear seize upon\nme, since ye are steadfast amid cruel terrors.  But now that we\nhave sailed out from the striking rocks, I trow that never\nhereafter will there be another such fearful thing, if indeed we\ngo on our way following the counsel of Phineus.”",
        "(ll. 648-668)  Thus he spake, and straightway they ceased from\nsuch words and gave unwearying labour to the oar; and quickly\nthey passed by the swiftly flowing river Rhebas and the peak of\nColone, and soon thereafter the black headland, and near it the\nmouth of the river Phyllis, where aforetime Dipsaeus received in\nhis home the son of Athamas, when with his ram he was flying from\nthe city of Orchomenus; and Dipsacus was the son of a meadow-\nnymph, nor was insolence his delight, but contented by his\nfather’s stream he dwelt with his mother, pasturing his flocks by\nthe shore.  And quickly they sighted and sailed past his shrine\nand the broad banks of the river and the plain, and deep-flowing\nCalpe, and all the windless night and the day they bent to their\ntireless oars.  And even as ploughing oxen toil as they cleave\nthe moist earth, and sweat streams in abundance from flank and\nneck; and from beneath the yoke their eyes roll askance, while\nthe breath ever rushes from their mouths in hot gasps; and all\nday long they toil, planting their hoofs deep in the ground; like\nthem the heroes kept dragging their oars through the sea.",
        "(ll. 669-685)  Now when divine light has not yet come nor is it\nutter darkness, but a faint glimmer has spread over the night,\nthe time when men wake and call it twilight, at that hour they\nran into the harbour of the desert island Thynias and, spent by\nweary toil, mounted the shore.  And to them the son of Leto, as\nhe passed from Lycia far away to the countless folk of the\nHyperboreans, appeared; and about his cheeks on both sides his\ngolden locks flowed in clusters as he moved; in his left hand he\nheld a silver bow, and on his back was slung a quiver hanging\nfrom his shoulders; and beneath his feet all the island quaked,\nand the waves surged high on the beach.  Helpless amazement\nseized them as they looked; and no one dared to gaze face to face\ninto the fair eyes of the god.  And they stood with heads bowed\nto the ground; but he, far off, passed on to the sea through the\nair; and at length Orpheus spake as follows, addressing the\nchiefs:",
        "(ll. 686-693)  “Come, let us call this island the sacred isle of\nApollo of the Dawn since he has appeared to all, passing by at\ndawn; and we will offer such sacrifices as we can, building an\naltar on the shore; and if hereafter he shall grant us a safe\nreturn to the Haemonian land, then will we lay on his altar the\nthighs of horned goats.  And now I bid you propitiate him with\nthe steam of sacrifice and libations.  Be gracious, O king, be\ngracious in thy appearing.”",
        "(ll. 694-713)  Thus he spake, and they straightway built up an\naltar with shingle; and over the island they wandered, seeking if\nhaply they could get a glimpse of a fawn or a wild goat, that\noften seek their pasture in the deep wood.  And for them Leto’s\nson provided a quarry; and with pious rites they wrapped in fat\nthe thigh bones of them all and burnt them on the sacred altar,\ncelebrating Apollo, Lord of Dawn.  And round the burning\nsacrifice they set up a broad dancing-ring, singing, “All hail\nfair god of healing, Phoebus, all hail,” and with them Oeagrus’\ngoodly son began a clear lay on his Bistonian lyre; how once\nbeneath the rocky ridge of Parnassus he slew with his bow the\nmonster Delphyne, he, still young and beardless, still rejoicing\nin his long tresses.  Mayst thou be gracious!  Ever, O king, be\nthy locks unshorn, ever unravaged; for so is it right.  And none\nbut Leto, daughter of Coeus, strokes them with her dear hands.\nAnd often the Corycian nymphs, daughters of Pleistus, took up the\ncheering strain crying “Healer\"; hence arose this lovely refrain\nof the hymn to Phoebus.",
        "(ll. 714-719)  Now when they had celebrated him with dance and\nsong they took an oath with holy libations, that they would ever\nhelp each other with concord of heart, touching the sacrifice as\nthey swore; and even now there stands there a temple to gracious\nConcord, which the heroes themselves reared, paying honour at\nthat time to the glorious goddess.",
        "(ll. 720-751)  Now when the third morning came, with a fresh west\nwind they left the lofty island.  Next, on the opposite side they\nsaw and passed the mouth of the river Sangarius and the fertile\nland of the Mariandyni, and the stream of Lycus and the\nAnthemoeisian lake; and beneath the breeze the ropes and all the\ntackling quivered as they sped onward.  During the night the wind\nceased and at dawn they gladly reached the haven of the\nAcherusian headland.  It rises aloft with steep cliffs, looking\ntowards the Bithynian sea; and beneath it smooth rocks, ever\nwashed by the sea, stand rooted firm; and round them the wave\nrolls and thunders loud, but above, wide-spreading plane trees\ngrow on the topmost point.  And from it towards the land a hollow\nglen slopes gradually away, where there is a cave of Hades\noverarched by wood and rocks.  From here an icy breath,\nunceasingly issuing from the chill recess, ever forms a\nglistening rime which melts again beneath the midday sun.  And\nnever does silence hold that grim headland, but there is a\ncontinual murmur from the sounding sea and the leaves that quiver\nin the winds from the cave.  And here is the outfall of the river\nAcheron which bursts its way through the headland and falls into\nthe Eastern sea, and a hollow ravine brings it down from above.\nIn after times the Nisaean Megarians named it Soonautes (2) when\nthey were about to settle in the land of the Mariandyni.  For\nindeed the river saved them with their ships when they were\ncaught in a violent tempest.  By this way the heroes took the\nship through (3) the Acherusian headland and came to land over\nagainst it as the wind had just ceased.",
        "(ll. 752-773)  Not long had they come unmarked by Lycus, the lord\nof that land, and the Mariandyni–they, the slayers of Amycus,\naccording to the report which the people heard before; but for\nthat very deed they even made a league with the heroes.  And\nPolydeuces himself they welcomed as a god, flocking from every\nside, since for a long time had they been warring against the\narrogant Bebrycians.  And so they went up all together into the\ncity, and all that day with friendly feelings made ready a feast\nwithin the palace of Lycus and gladdened their souls with\nconverse.  Aeson’s son told him the lineage and name of each of\nhis comrades and the behests of Pelias, and how they were\nwelcomed by the Lemnian women, and all that they did at Dolionian\nCyzieus; and how they reached the Mysian land and Cius, where,\nsore against their will, they left behind the hero Heracles, and\nhe told the saying of Glaucus, and how they slew the Bebrycians\nand Amycus, and he told of the prophecies and affliction of\nPhineus, and how they escaped the Cyanean rocks, and how they met\nwith Leto’s son at the island.  And as he told all, Lycus was\ncharmed in soul with listening; and he grieved for Heracles left\nbehind, and spake as follows among them all:",
        "(ll. 774-810)  “O friends, what a man he was from whose help ye\nhave fallen away, as ye cleave your long path to Aeetes; for well\ndo I know that I saw him here in the halls of Dascylus my father,\nwhen he came hither on foot through the land of Asia bringing the\ngirdle of warlike Hippolyte; and me he found with the down just\ngrowing on my cheeks.  And here, when my brother Priolas was\nslain by the Mysians–my brother, whom ever since the people\nlament with most piteous dirges–he entered the lists with\nTitias in boxing and slew him, mighty Titias, who surpassed all\nthe youths in beauty and strength; and he dashed his teeth to the\nground.  Together with the Mysians he subdued beneath my father’s\nsway the Phrygians also, who inhabit the lands next to us, and he\nmade his own the tribes of the Bithynians and their land, as far\nas the mouth of Rhebas and the peak of Colone; and besides them\nthe Paphlagonians of Pelops yielded just as they were, even all\nthose round whom the dark water of Billaeus breaks.  But now the\nBebrycians and the insolence of Amycus have robbed me, since\nHeracles dwells far away, for they have long been cutting off\nhuge pieces of my land until they have set their bounds at the\nmeadows of deep-flowing Hypius.  Nevertheless, by your hands have\nthey paid the penalty; and it was not without the will of heaven,\nI trow, that he brought war on the Bebrycians this day–he, the\nson of Tyndareus, when he slew that champion.  Wherefore whatever\nrequital I am now able to pay, gladly will I pay it, for that is\nthe rule for weaker men when the stronger begin to help them.  So\nwith you all, and in your company, I bid Dascylus my son follow;\nand if he goes, you will find all men friendly that ye meet on\nyour way through the sea even to the mouth of the river\nThermodon.  And besides that, to the sons of Tyndareus will I\nraise a lofty temple on the Acherusian height, which all sailors\nshall mark far across the sea and shall reverence; and hereafter\nfor them will I set apart outside the city, as for gods, some\nfertile fields of the well-tilled plain.”",
        "(ll. 811-814)  Thus all day long they revelled at the banquet.\nBut at dawn they hied down to the ship in haste; and with them\nwent Lycus himself, when he had given them countless gifts to\nbear away; and with them he sent forth his son from his home.",
        "(ll. 815-834)  And here his destined fate smote Idmon, son of\nAbas, skilled in soothsaying; but not at all did his soothsaying\nsave him, for necessity drew him on to death.  For in the mead of\nthe reedy river there lay, cooling his flanks and huge belly in\nthe mud, a white-tusked boar, a deadly monster, whom even the\nnymphs of the marsh dreaded, and no man knew it; but all alone he\nwas feeding in the wide fell.  But the son of Abas was passing\nalong the raised banks of the muddy river, and the boar from some\nunseen lair leapt out of the reed-bed, and charging gashed his\nthigh and severed in twain the sinews and the bone.  And with a\nsharp cry the hero fell to the ground; and as he was struck his\ncomrades flocked together with answering cry.  And quickly Peleus\nwith his hunting spear aimed at the murderous boar as he fled\nback into the fen; and again he turned and charged; but Idas\nwounded him, and with a roar he fell impaled upon the sharp\nspear.  And the boar they left on the ground just as he had\nfallen there; but Idmon, now at the last gasp, his comrades bore\nto the ship in sorrow of heart, and he died in his comrades’\narms.",
        "(ll. 835-850)  And here they stayed from taking thought for their\nvoyaging and abode in grief for the burial of their dead friend.\nAnd for three whole days they lamented; and on the next they\nburied him with full honours, and the people and King Lycus\nhimself took part in the funeral rites; and, as is the due of the\ndeparted, they slaughtered countless sheep at his tomb.  And so a\nbarrow to this hero was raised in that land, and there stands a\ntoken for men of later days to see, the trunk of a wild olive\ntree, such as ships are built of; and it flourishes with its\ngreen leaves a little below the Acherusian headland.  And if at\nthe bidding of the Muses I must tell this tale outright, Phoebus\nstrictly commanded the Boeotians and Nisaeans to worship him as\nguardian of their city, and to build their city round the trunk\nof the ancient wild olive; but they, instead of the god-fearing\nAeolid Idmon, at this day honour Agamestor.",
        "(ll. 851-868)  Who was the next that died?  For then a second\ntime the heroes heaped up a barrow for a comrade dead.  For still\nare to be seen two monuments of those heroes.  The tale goes that\nTiphys son of Hagnias died; nor was it his destiny thereafter to\nsail any further.  But him there on the spot a short sickness\nlaid to rest far from his native land, when the company had paid\ndue honours to the dead son of Abas.  And at the cruel woe they\nwere seized with unbearable grief.  For when with due honours\nthey had buried him also hard by the seer, they cast themselves\ndown in helplessness on the sea-shore silently, closely wrapped\nup, and took no thought for meat or drink; and their spirit\ndrooped in grief, for all hope of return was gone.  And in their\nsorrow they would have stayed from going further had not Hera\nkindled exceeding courage in Ancaeus, whom near the waters of\nImbrasus Astypalaea bore to Poseidon; for especially was he\nskilled in steering and eagerly did he address Peleus:",
        "(ll. 869-877)  “Son of Aeacus, is it well for us to give up our\ntoils and linger on in a strange land?  Not so much for my\nprowess in war did Jason take me with him in quest of the fleece,\nfar from Parthenia, as for my knowledge of ships.  Wherefore, I\npray, let there be no fear for the ship.  And so there are here\nother men of skill, of whom none will harm our voyaging,\nwhomsoever we set at the helm.  But quickly tell forth all this\nand boldly urge them to call to mind their task.”",
        "(ll. 878-884)  Thus he spake; and Peleus’ soul was stirred with\ngladness, and straightway he spake in the midst of all: “My\nfriends, why do we thus cherish a bootless grief like this?  For\nthose two have perished by the fate they have met with; but among\nour host are steersmen yet, and many a one.  Wherefore let us not\ndelay our attempt, but rouse yourselves to the work and cast away\nyour griefs.”",
        "(ll. 885-893)  And him in reply Aeson’s son addressed with\nhelpless words: “Son of Aeacus, where are these steersmen of\nthine?  For those whom we once deemed to be men of skill, they\neven more than I are bowed with vexation of heart.  Wherefore I\nforebode an evil doom for us even as for the dead, if it shall be\nour lot neither to reach the city of fell Aeetes, nor ever again\nto pass beyond the rocks to the land of Hellas, but a wretched\nfate will enshroud us here ingloriously till we grow old for\nnaught.”",
        "(ll. 894-898)  Thus he spake, but Ancaeus quickly undertook to\nguide the swift ship; for he was stirred by the impulse of the\ngoddess.  And after him Erginus and Nauplius and Euphemus started\nup, eager to steer.  But the others held them back, and many of\nhis comrades granted it to Ancaeus.",
        "(ll. 899-910)  So on the twelfth day they went aboard at dawn,\nfor a strong breeze of westerly wind was blowing.  And quickly\nwith the oars they passed out through the river Acheron and,\ntrusting to the wind, shook out their sails, and with canvas\nspread far and wide they were cleaving their passage through the\nwaves in fair weather.  And soon they passed the outfall of the\nriver Callichorus, where, as the tale goes, the Nysean son of\nZeus, when he had left the tribes of the Indians and came to\ndwell at Thebes, held revels and arrayed dances in front of a\ncave, wherein he passed unsmiling sacred nights, from which time\nthe neighbours call the river by the name of Callichorus (4) and\nthe cave Aulion.(5)",
        "(ll. 911-929)  Next they beheld the barrow of Sthenelus, Actor’s\nson, who on his way back from the valorous war against the\nAmazons–for he had been the comrade of Heracles–was struck\nby an arrow and died there upon the sea-beach.  And for a time\nthey went no further, for Persephone herself sent forth the\nspirit of Actor’s son which craved with many tears to behold men\nlike himself, even for a moment.  And mounting on the edge of the\nbarrow he gazed upon the ship, such as he was when he went to\nwar; and round his head a fair helm with four peaks gleamed with\nits blood-red crest.  And again he entered the vast gloom; and\nthey looked and marvelled; and Mopsus, son of Ampycus, with word\nof prophecy urged them to land and propitiate him with libations.\nQuickly they drew in sail and threw out hawsers, and on the\nstrand paid honour to the tomb of Sthenelus, and poured out drink\nofferings to him and sacrificed sheep as victims.  And besides\nthe drink offerings they built an altar to Apollo, saviour of\nships, and burnt thigh bones; and Orpheus dedicated his lyre;\nwhence the place has the name of Lyra.",
        "(ll. 930-945)  And straightway they went aboard as the wind blew\nstrong; and they drew the sail down, and made it taut to both\nsheets; then Argo was borne over the sea swiftly, even as a hawk\nsoaring high through the air commits to the breeze its outspread\nwings and is borne on swiftly, nor swerves in its flight, poising\nin the clear sky with quiet pinions.  And lo, they passed by the\nstream of Parthenius as it flows into the sea, a most gentle\nriver, where the maid, daughter of Leto, when she mounts to\nheaven after the chase, cools her limbs in its much-desired\nwaters.  Then they sped onward in the night without ceasing, and\npassed Sesamus and lofty Erythini, Crobialus, Cromna and woody\nCytorus.  Next they swept round Carambis at the rising of the\nsun, and plied the oars past long Aegialus, all day and on\nthrough the night.",
        "(ll. 946-965)  And straightway they landed on the Assyrian shore\nwhere Zeus himself gave a home to Sinope, daughter of Asopus, and\ngranted her virginity, beguiled by his own promises.  For he\nlonged for her love, and he promised to grant her whatever her\nhearts desire might be.  And she in her craftiness asked of him\nvirginity.  And in like manner she deceived Apollo too who longed\nto wed her, and besides them the river Halys, and no man ever\nsubdued her in love’s embrace.  And there the sons of noble\nDeimachus of Tricca were still dwelling, Deileon, Autolycus and\nPhlogius, since the day when they wandered far away from\nHeracles; and they, when they marked the array of chieftains,\nwent to meet them and declared in truth who they were; and they\nwished to remain there no longer, but as soon as Argestes (6)\nblew went on ship-board.  And so with them, borne along by the\nswift breeze, the heroes left behind the river Halys, and left\nbehind his that flows hard by, and the delta-land of Assyria; and\non the same day they rounded the distant headland of the Amazons\nthat guards their harbour.",
        "(ll. 966-1001)  Here once when Melanippe, daughter of Ares, had,\ngone forth, the hero Heracles caught her by ambuscade and\nHippolyte gave him her glistening girdle as her sister’s ransom,\nand he sent away his captive unharmed.  In the bay of this\nheadland, at the outfall of Thermodon, they ran ashore, for the\nsea was rough for their voyage.  No river is like this, and none\nsends forth from itself such mighty streams over the land.  If a\nman should count every one he would lack but four of a hundred,\nbut the real spring is only one.  This flows down to the plain\nfrom lofty mountains, which, men say, are called the Amazonian\nmountains.  Thence it spreads inland over a hilly country\nstraight forward; wherefrom its streams go winding on, and they\nroll on, this way and that ever more, wherever best they can\nreach the lower ground, one at a distance and another near at\nhand; and many streams are swallowed up in the sand and are\nwithout a name; but, mingled with a few, the main stream openly\nbursts with its arching crest of foam into the inhospitable\nPontus.  And they would have tarried there and have closed in\nbattle with the Amazons, and would have fought not without\nbloodshed for the Amazons were not gentle foes and regarded not\njustice, those dwellers on the Doeantian plain; but grievous\ninsolence and the works of Ares were all their care; for by race\nthey were the daughters of Ares and the nymph Harmonia, who bare\nto Ares war-loving maids, wedded to him in the glens of the\nAcmonian wood had not the breezes of Argestes come again from\nZeus; and with the wind they left the rounded beach, where the\nThemiscyreian Amazons were arming for war.  For they dwelt not\ngathered together in one city, but scattered over the land,\nparted into three tribes.  In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians,\nover whom at that time Hippolyte reigned, in another the\nLycastians, and in another the dart-throwing Chadesians.  And the\nnext day they sped on and at nightfall they reached the land of\nthe Chalybes.",
        "(ll. 1002-1008)  That folk have no care for ploughing with oxen\nor for any planting of honey-sweet fruit; nor yet do they pasture\nflocks in the dewy meadow.  But they cleave the hard iron-bearing\nland and exchange their wages for daily sustenance; never does\nthe morn rise for them without toil, but amid bleak sooty flames\nand smoke they endure heavy labour.",
        "(ll. 1009-1014)  And straightway thereafter they rounded the\nheadland of Genetaean Zeus and sped safely past the land of the\nTibareni.  Here when wives bring forth children to their\nhusbands, the men lie in bed and groan with their heads close\nbound; but the women tend them with food, and prepare child-birth\nbaths for them.",
        "(ll. 1015-1029)  Next they reached the sacred mount and the land\nwhere the Mossynoeci dwell amid high mountains in wooden huts,\n(7) from which that people take their name.  And strange are\ntheir customs and laws.  Whatever it is right to do openly before\nthe people or in the market place, all this they do in their\nhomes, but whatever acts we perform at home, these they perform\nout of doors in the midst of the streets, without blame.  And\namong them is no reverence for the marriage-bed, but, like swine\nthat feed in herds, no whit abashed in others’ presence, on the\nearth they lie with the women.  Their king sits in the loftiest\nhut and dispenses upright judgments to the multitude, poor\nwretch!  For if haply he err at all in his decrees, for that day\nthey keep him shut up in starvation.",
        "(ll. 1030-1046)  They passed them by and cleft their way with\noars over against the island of Ares all day long; for at dusk\nthe light breeze left them.  At last they spied above them,\nhurtling through the air, one of the birds of Ares which haunt\nthat isle.  It shook its wings down over the ship as she sped on\nand sent against her a keen feather, and it fell on the left\nshoulder of goodly Oileus, and he dropped his oar from his hands\nat the sudden blow, and his comrades marvelled at the sight of\nthe winged bolt.  And Eribotes from his seat hard by drew out the\nfeather, and bound up the wound when he had loosed the strap\nhanging from his own sword-sheath; and besides the first, another\nbird appeared swooping down; but the hero Clytius, son of Eurytus\n– for he bent his curved bow, and sped a swift arrow against the\nbird–struck it, and it whirled round and fell close to the\nship.  And to them spake Amphidamas, son of Aleus:",
        "(ll. 1047-1067)  “The island of Ares is near us; you know it\nyourselves now that ye have seen these birds.  But little will\narrows avail us, I trow, for landing.  But let us contrive some\nother device to help us, if ye intend to land, bearing in mind\nthe injunction of Phineus.  For not even could Heracles, when he\ncame to Arcadia, drive away with bow and arrow the birds that\nswam on the Stymphalian lake.  I saw it myself.  But he shook in\nhis hand a rattle of bronze and made a loud clatter as he stood\nupon a lofty peak, and the birds fled far off, screeching in\nbewildered fear.  Wherefore now too let us contrive some such\ndevice, and I myself will speak, having pondered the matter\nbeforehand.  Set on your heads your helmets of lofty crest, then\nhalf row by turns, and half fence the ship about with polished\nspears and shields.  Then all together raise a mighty shout so\nthat the birds may be scared by the unwonted din, the nodding\ncrests, and the uplifted spears on high.  And if we reach the\nisland itself, then make mighty noise with the clashing of\nshields.”",
        "(ll. 1068-1089)  Thus he spake, and the helpful device pleased\nall.  And on their heads they placed helmets of bronze, gleaming\nterribly, and the blood-red crests were tossing.  And half of\nthem rowed in turn, and the rest covered the ship with spears and\nshields.  And as when a man roofs over a house with tiles, to be\nan ornament of his home and a defence against rain, and one the\nfits firmly into another, each after each; so they roofed over\nthe ship with their shields, locking them together.  And as a din\narises from a warrior-host of men sweeping on, when lines of\nbattle meet, such a shout rose upward from the ship into the air.\nNow they saw none of the birds yet, but when they touched the\nisland and clashed upon their shields, then the birds in\ncountless numbers rose in flight hither and thither.  And as when\nthe son of Cronos sends from the clouds a dense hailstorm on city\nand houses, and the people who dwell beneath hear the din above\nthe roof and sit quietly, since the stormy season has not come\nupon them unawares, but they have first made strong their roofs;\nso the birds sent against the heroes a thick shower of feather-\nshafts as they darted over the sea to the mountains of the land\nopposite.",
        "(ll. 1090-1092)  What then was the purpose of Phineus in bidding\nthe divine band of heroes land there?  Or what kind of help was\nabout to meet their desire?",
        "(ll. 1093-1122)  The sons of Phrixus were faring towards the city\nof Orchomenus from Aea, coming from Cytaean Aeetes, on board a\nColchian ship, to win the boundless wealth of their father; for\nhe, when dying, had enjoined this journey upon them.  And lo, on\nthat day they were very near that island.  But Zeus had impelled\nthe north wind’s might to blow, marking by rain the moist path of\nArcturus; and all day long he was stirring the leaves upon the\nmountains, breathing gently upon the topmost sprays; but at night\nhe rushed upon the sea with monstrous force, and with his\nshrieking blasts uplifted the surge; and a dark mist covered the\nheavens, nor did the bright stars anywhere appear from among the\nclouds, but a murky gloom brooded all around.  And so the sons of\nPhrixus, drenched and trembling in fear of a horrible doom, were\nborne along by the waves helplessly.  And the force of the wind\nhad snatched away their sails and shattered in twain the hull,\ntossed as it was by the breakers.  And hereupon by heaven’s\nprompting those four clutched a huge beam, one of many that were\nscattered about, held together by sharp bolts, when the ship\nbroke to pieces.  And on to the island the waves and the blasts\nof wind bore the men in their distress, within a little of death.\nAnd straightway a mighty rain burst forth, and rained upon the\nsea and the island, and all the country opposite the island,\nwhere the arrogant Mossynoeci dwelt.  And the sweep of the waves\nhurled the sons of Phrixus, together with their massy beam, upon\nthe beach of the island, in the murky night; and the floods of\nrain from Zeus ceased at sunrise, and soon the two bands drew\nnear and met each other, and Argus spoke first:",
        "(ll. 1123-1133)  “We beseech you, by Zeus the Beholder, whoever\nye are, to be kindly and to help us in our need.  For fierce\ntempests, falling on the sea, have shattered all the timbers of\nthe crazy ship in which we were cleaving our path on business\nbent.  Wherefore we entreat you, if haply ye will listen, to\ngrant us just a covering for our bodies, and to pity and succour\nmen in misfortune, your equals in age.  Oh, reverence suppliants\nand strangers for Zeus’ sake, the god of strangers and\nsuppliants.  To Zeus belong both suppliants and strangers; and\nhis eye, methinks, beholdeth even us.”",
        "(ll. 1134-1139)  And in reply the son of Aeson prudently\nquestioned him, deeming that the prophecies of Phineus were being\nfulfilled: “All these things will we straightway grant you with\nright good will.  But come tell me truly in what country ye dwell\nand what business bids you sail across the sea, and tell me your\nown glorious names and lineage.”",
        "(ll. 1140-1156)  And him Argus, helpless in his evil plight,\naddressed: “That one Phrixus an Aeolid reached Aea from Hellas\nyou yourselves have clearly heard ere this, I trow; Phrixus, who\ncame to the city of Aeetes, bestriding a ram, which Hermes had\nmade all gold; and the fleece ye may see even now.  The ram, at\nits own prompting, he then sacrificed to Zeus, son of Cronos,\nabove all, the god of fugitives.  And him did Aeetes receive in\nhis palace, and with gladness of heart gave him his daughter\nChalciope in marriage without gifts of wooing. (8)  From\nthose two are we sprung. But Phrixus died at last, an aged man,\nin the home of Aeetes; and we, giving heed to our father’s\nbehests, are journeying to Orehomenus to take the possessions of\nAthamas. And if thou dost desire to learn our names, this is\nCytissorus, this Phrontis, and this Melas, and me ye may. call\nArgus.”",
        "(ll. 1157-1159)  Thus he spake, and the chieftains rejoiced at\nthe meeting, and tended them, much marvelling.  And Jason again\nin turn replied, as was fitting, with these words:",
        "(ll. 1160-1178)  “Surely ye are our kinsmen on my father’s side,\nand ye pray that with kindly hearts we succour your evil plight.\nFor Cretheus and Athamas were brothers.  I am the grandson of\nCretheus, and with these comrades here I am journeying from that\nsame Hellas to the city of Aeetes.  But of these things we will\nconverse hereafter.  And do ye first put clothing upon you.  By\nheaven’s devising, I ween, have ye come to my hands in your sore\nneed.”",
        "(ll. 1168-1178)  He spake, and out of the ship gave them raiment\nto put on.  Then all together they went to the temple of Ares to\noffer sacrifice of sheep; and in haste they stood round the\naltar, which was outside the roofless temple, an altar built of\npebbles; within a black stone stood fixed, a sacred thing, to\nwhich of yore the Amazons all used to pray.  Nor was it lawful\nfor them, when they came from the opposite coast, to burn on this\naltar offerings of sheep and oxen, but they used to slay horses\nwhich they kept in great herds.  Now when they had sacrificed and\neaten the feast prepared, then Aeson’s son spake among them and\nthus began:",
        "(ll. 1179-1195)  “Zeus’ self, I ween, beholds everything; nor do\nwe men escape his eye, we that be god-fearing and just, for as he\nrescued your father from the hands of a murderous step-dame and\ngave him measureless wealth besides; even so hath he saved you\nharmless from the baleful storm.  And on board this ship ye may\nsail hither and thither, where ye will, whether to Aea or to the\nwealthy city of divine Orthomenus.  For our ship Athena built and\nwith axe of bronze cut her timbers near the crest of Pelion, and\nwith the goddess wrought Argus.  But yours the fierce surge hath\nshattered, before ye came nigh to the rocks which all day long\nclash together in the straits of the sea.  But come, be\nyourselves our helpers, for we are eager to bring to Hellas the\ngolden fleece, and guide us on our voyage, for I go to atone for\nthe intended sacrifice of Phrixus, the cause of Zeus’ wrath\nagainst the sons of Aeolus.”",
        "(ll. 1196-1199)  He spake with soothing words; but horror seized\nthem when they heard.  For they deemed that they would not find\nAeetes friendly if they desired to take away the ram’s fleece.\nAnd Argus spake as follows, vexed that they should busy\nthemselves with such a quest:",
        "(ll. 1200-1215)  “My friends, our strength, so far as it avails,\nshall never cease to help you, not one whit, when need shall\ncome.  But Aeetes is terribly armed with deadly ruthlessness;\nwherefore exceedingly do I dread this voyage.  And he boasts\nhimself to be the son of Helios; and all round dwell countless\ntribes of Colchians; and he might match himself with Ares in his\ndread war-cry and giant strength.  Nay, to seize the fleece in\nspite of Aeetes is no easy task; so huge a serpent keeps guard\nround and about it, deathless and sleepless, which Earth herself\nbrought forth on the sides of Caucasus, by the rock of Typhaon,\nwhere Typhaon, they say, smitten by the bolt of Zeus, son of\nCronos, when he lifted against the god his sturdy hands, dropped\nfrom his head hot gore; and in such plight he reached the\nmountains and plain of Nysa, where to this day he lies whelmed\nbeneath the waters of the Serbonian lake.”",
        "(ll. 1216-1218) Thus he spake, and straightway many a cheek grew\npale when they heard of so mighty an adventure.  But quickly\nPeleus answered with cheering words, and thus spake:",
        "(ll. 1219-1225)  “Be not so fearful in spirit, my good friend.\nFor we are not so lacking in prowess as to be no match for Aeetes\nto try his strength with arms; but I deem that we too are cunning\nin war, we that go thither, near akin to the blood of the blessed\ngods.  Wherefore if he will not grant us the fleece of gold for\nfriendship’s sake, the tribes of the Colchians will not avail\nhim, I ween.”",
        "(ll. 1226-1230)  Thus they addressed each other in turn, until\nagain, satisfied with their feast, they turned to rest.  And when\nthey rose at dawn a gentle breeze was blowing; and they raised\nthe sails, which strained to the rush of the wind, and quickly\nthey left behind the island of Ares.",
        "(ll. 1231-1241)  And at nightfall they came to the island of\nPhilyra, where Cronos, son of Uranus, what time in Olympus he\nreigned over the Titans, and Zeus was yet being nurtured in a\nCretan cave by the Curetes of Ida, lay beside Philyra, when he\nhad deceived Rhea; and the goddess found them in the midst of\ntheir dalliance; and Cronos leapt up from the couch with a rush\nin the form of a steed with flowing mane, but Ocean’s daughter,\nPhilyra, in shame left the spot and those haunts, and came to the\nlong Pelasgian ridges, where by her union with the transfigured\ndeity she brought forth huge Cheiron, half like a horse, half\nlike a god.",
        "(ll. 1242-1261)  Thence they sailed on, past the Macrones and the\nfar-stretching land of the Becheiri and the overweening Sapeires,\nand after them the Byzeres; for ever forward they clave their\nway, quickly borne by the gentle breeze.  And lo, as they sped\non, a deep gulf of the sea was opened, and lo, the steep crags of\nthe Caucasian mountains rose up, where, with his limbs bound upon\nthe hard rocks by galling fetters of bronze, Prometheus fed with\nhis liver an eagle that ever rushed back to its prey.  High above\nthe ship at even they saw it flying with a loud whirr, near the\nclouds; and yet it shook all the sails with the fanning of those\nhuge wings.  For it had not the form of a bird of the air but\nkept poising its long wing-feathers like polished oars.  And not\nlong after they heard the bitter cry of Prometheus as his liver\nwas being torn away; and the air rang with his screams until they\nmarked the ravening eagle rushing back from the mountain on the\nself-same track.  And at night, by the skill of Argus, they\nreached broad-flowing Phasis, and the utmost bourne of the sea.",
        "(ll. 1262-1276)  And straightway they let down the sails and the\nyard-arm and stowed them inside the hollow mast-crutch, and at\nonce they lowered the mast itself till it lay along; and quickly\nwith oars they entered the mighty stream of the river; and round\nthe prow the water surged as it gave them way.  And on their left\nhand they had lofty Caucasus and the Cytaean city of Aea, and on\nthe other side the plain of Ares and the sacred grove of that\ngod, where the serpent was keeping watch and ward over the fleece\nas it hung on the leafy branches of an oak.  And Aeson’s son\nhimself from a golden goblet poured into the river libations of\nhoney and pure wine to Earth and to the gods of the country, and\nto the souls of dead heroes; and he besought them of their grace\nto give kindly aid, and to welcome their ship’s hawsers with\nfavourable omen.  And straightway Ancaeus spake these words:",
        "(ll. 1277-1280)  “We have reached the Colchian land and the\nstream of Phasis; and it is time for us to take counsel whether\nwe shall make trial of Aeetes with soft words, or an attempt of\nanother kind shall be fitting.”",
        "(ll. 1281-1285)  Thus he spake, and by the advice of Argus Jason\nbade them enter a shaded backwater and let the ship ride at\nanchor off shore; and it was near at hand in their course and\nthere they passed the night.  And soon the dawn appeared to their\nexpectant eyes.",
        "ENDNOTES:\n(1)  i.e. Polydeuces.\n(2)  i.e. Saviour of Sailors.\n(3)  i.e. through the ravine that divides the headland.\n(4)  i.e. river of fair dances.\n(5)  i.e. the bedchamber.\n(6)  The north-west wind.\n(7)  Called “Mossynes”.\n(8)  i.e. without exacting gifts from the bridegroom.  So in the\n     “Iliad” (ix. 146) Agamemnon offers Achilles any of his three\n     daughters ANAEONOS.",
        "(ll. 1-5)  Come now, Erato, stand by my side, and say next how\nJason brought back the fleece to Iolcus aided by the love of\nMedea.  For thou sharest the power of Cypris, and by thy\nlove-cares dost charm unwedded maidens; wherefore to thee too is\nattached a name that tells of love.",
        "(ll. 6-10)  Thus the heroes, unobserved, were waiting in ambush\namid the thick reed-beds; but Hera and Athena took note of them,\nand, apart from Zeus and the other immortals, entered a chamber\nand took counsel together; and Hera first made trial of Athena:",
        "(ll. 11-16)  “Do thou now first, daughter of Zeus, give advice.\nWhat must be done?  Wilt thou devise some scheme whereby they may\nseize the golden fleece of Aeetes and bear it to Hellas, or can\nthey deceive the king with soft words and so work persuasion?  Of\na truth he is terribly overweening.  Still it is right to shrink\nfrom no endeavour.”",
        "(ll. 17-21)  Thus she spake, and at once Athena addressed her: “I\ntoo was pondering such thoughts in my heart, Hera, when thou\ndidst ask me outright.  But not yet do I think that I have\nconceived a scheme to aid the courage of the heroes, though I\nhave balanced many plans.”",
        "(ll. 22-29)  She ended, and the goddesses fixed their eyes on the\nground at their feet, brooding apart; and straightway Hera was\nthe first to speak her thought: “Come, let us go to Cypris; let\nboth of us accost her and urge her to bid her son (if only he\nwill obey) speed his shaft at the daughter of Aeetes, the\nenchantress, and charm her with love for Jason.  And I deem that\nby her device he will bring back the fleece to Hellas.”",
        "(ll. 30-31)  Thus she spake, and the prudent plan pleased Athena,\nand she addressed her in reply with gentle words:",
        "(ll. 32-35)  “Hera, my father begat me to be a stranger to the\ndarts of love, nor do I know any charm to work desire.  But if\nthe word pleases thee, surely I will follow; but thou must speak\nwhen we meet her.”",
        "(ll. 36-51)  So she said, and starting forth they came to the\nmighty palace of Cypris, which her husband, the halt-footed god,\nhad built for her when first he brought her from Zeus to be his\nwife.  And entering the court they stood beneath the gallery of\nthe chamber where the goddess prepared the couch of Hephaestus.\nBut he had gone early to his forge and anvils to a broad cavern\nin a floating island where with the blast of flame he wrought all\nmanner of curious work; and she all alone was sitting within, on\nan inlaid seat facing the door.  And her white shoulders on each\nside were covered with the mantle of her hair and she was parting\nit with a golden comb and about to braid up the long tresses; but\nwhen she saw the goddesses before her, she stayed and called them\nwithin, and rose from her seat and placed them on couches.  Then\nshe herself sat down, and with her hands gathered up the locks\nstill uncombed.  And smiling she addressed them with crafty\nwords:",
        "(ll. 52-54)  “Good friends, what intent, what occasion brings you\nhere after so long?  Why have ye come, not too frequent visitors\nbefore, chief among goddesses that ye are?”",
        "(ll. 55-75)  And to her Hera replied: “Thou dost mock us, but our\nhearts are stirred with calamity.  For already on the river\nPhasis the son of Aeson moors his ship, he and his comrades in\nquest of the fleece.  For all their sakes we fear terribly (for\nthe task is nigh at hand) but most for Aeson’s son.  Him will I\ndeliver, though he sail even to Hades to free Ixion below from\nhis brazen chains, as far as strength lies in my limbs, so that\nPelias may not mock at having escaped an evil doom–Pelias who\nleft me unhonoured with sacrifice.  Moreover Jason was greatly\nloved by me before, ever since at the mouth of Anaurus in flood,\nas I was making trial of men’s righteousness, he met me on his\nreturn from the chase; and all the mountains and long ridged\npeaks were sprinkled with snow, and from them the torrents\nrolling down were rushing with a roar.  And he took pity on me in\nthe likeness of an old crone, and raising me on his shoulders\nhimself bore me through the headlong tide.  So he is honoured by\nme unceasingly; nor will Pelias pay the penalty of his outrage,\nunless thou wilt grant Jason his return.”",
        "(ll. 76-82)  Thus she spake, and speechlessness seized Cypris.\nAnd beholding Hera supplicating her she felt awe, and then\naddressed her with friendly words: “Dread goddess, may no viler\nthing than Cypris ever be found, if I disregard thy eager desire\nin word or deed, whatever my weak arms can effect; and let there\nbe no favour in return.”",
        "(ll. 83-89)  She spake, and Hera again addressed her with\nprudence: “It is not in need of might or of strength that we have\ncome.  But just quietly bid thy boy charm Aeetes’ daughter with\nlove for Jason.  For if she will aid him with her kindly counsel,\neasily do I think he will win the fleece of gold and return to\nIolcus, for she is full of wiles.”",
        "(ll. 90-99)  Thus she spake, and Cypris addressed them both:\n\"Hera and Athena, he will obey you rather than me.  For unabashed\nthough he is, there will be some slight shame in his eyes before\nyou; but he has no respect for me, but ever slights me in\ncontentious mood.  And, overborne by his naughtiness, I purpose\nto break his ill-sounding arrows and his bow in his very sight.\nFor in his anger he has threatened that if I shall not keep my\nhands off him while he still masters his temper, I shall have\ncause to blame myself thereafter.”",
        "(ll. 100-105)  So she spake, and the goddesses smiled and looked\nat each other.  But Cypris again spoke, vexed at heart: “To\nothers my sorrows are a jest; nor ought I to tell them to all; I\nknow them too well myself.  But now, since this pleases you both,\nI will make the attempt and coax him, and he will not say me\nnay.”",
        "(ll. 106-110)  Thus she spake, and Hera took her slender hand and\ngently smiling, replied: “Perform this task, Cytherea,\nstraightway, as thou sayest; and be not angry or contend with thy\nboy; he will cease hereafter to vex thee.”",
        "(ll. 111-128)  She spake, and left her seat, and Athena\naccompanied her and they went forth both hastening back.  And\nCypris went on her way through the glens of Olympus to find her\nboy.  And she found him apart, in the blooming orchard of Zeus,\nnot alone, but with him Ganymedes, whom once Zeus had set to\ndwell among the immortal gods, being enamoured of his beauty. \nAnd they were playing for golden dice, as boys in one house are\nwont to do.  And already greedy Eros was holding the palm of his\nleft hand quite full of them under his breast, standing upright;\nand on the bloom of his cheeks a sweet blush was glowing.  But\nthe other sat crouching hard by, silent and downcast, and he had\ntwo dice left which he threw one after the other, and was angered\nby the loud laughter of Eros.  And lo, losing them straightway\nwith the former, he went off empty handed, helpless, and noticed\nnot the approach of Cypris.  And she stood before her boy, and\nlaying her hand on his lips, addressed him:",
        "(ll. 129-144)  “Why dost thou smile in triumph, unutterable\nrogue?  Hast thou cheated him thus, and unjustly overcome the\ninnocent child?  Come, be ready to perform for me the task I will\ntell thee of, and I will give thee Zeus’ all-beauteous plaything\n– the one which his dear nurse Adrasteia made for him, while he\nstill lived a child, with childish ways, in the Idaean cave–a\nwell-rounded ball; no better toy wilt thou get from the hands of\nHephaestus.  All of gold are its zones, and round each double\nseams run in a circle; but the stitches are hidden, and a dark\nblue spiral overlays them all.  But if thou shouldst cast it with\nthy hands, lo, like a star, it sends a flaming track through the\nsky.  This I will give thee; and do thou strike with thy shaft\nand charm the daughter of Aeetes with love for Jason; and let\nthere be no loitering.  For then my thanks would be the\nslighter.”",
        "(ll. 145-150)  Thus she spake, and welcome were her words to the\nlistening boy.  And he threw down all his toys, and eagerly\nseizing her robe on this side and on that, clung to the goddess.\nAnd he implored her to bestow the gift at once; but she, facing\nhim with kindly words, touched his cheeks, kissed him and drew\nhim to her, and replied with a smile:",
        "(ll. 151-153)  “Be witness now thy dear head and mine, that\nsurely I will give thee the gift and deceive thee not, if thou\nwilt strike with thy shaft Aeetes’ daughter.”",
        "(ll. 154-166)  She spoke, and he gathered up his dice, and having\nwell counted them all threw them into his mother’s gleaming lap.\nAnd straightway with golden baldric he slung round him his quiver\nfrom where it leant against a tree-trunk, and took up his curved\nbow.  And he fared forth through the fruitful orchard of the\npalace of Zeus.  Then he passed through the gates of Olympus high\nin air; hence is a downward path from heaven; and the twin poles\nrear aloft steep mountain tops the highest crests of earth, where\nthe risen sun grows ruddy with his first beams.  And beneath him\nthere appeared now the life-giving earth and cities of men and\nsacred streams of rivers, and now in turn mountain peaks and the\nocean all around, as he swept through the vast expanse of air.",
        "(ll. 167-193)  Now the heroes apart in ambush, in a back-water of\nthe river, were met in council, sitting on the benches of their\nship.  And Aeson’s son himself was speaking among them; and they\nwere listening silently in their places sitting row upon row: “My\nfriends, what pleases myself that will I say out; it is for you\nto bring about its fulfilment.  For in common is our task, and\ncommon to all alike is the right of speech; and he who in silence\nwithholds his thought and his counsel, let him know that it is he\nalone that bereaves this band of its home-return.  Do ye others\nrest here in the ship quietly with your arms; but I will go to\nthe palace of Aeetes, taking with me the sons of Phrixus and two\ncomrades as well.  And when I meet him I will first make trial\nwith words to see if he will be willing to give up the golden\nfleece for friendship’s sake or not, but trusting to his might\nwill set at nought our quest.  For so, learning his frowardness\nfirst from himself, we will consider whether we shall meet him in\nbattle, or some other plan shall avail us, if we refrain from the\nwar-cry.  And let us not merely by force, before putting words to\nthe test, deprive him of his own possession.  But first it is\nbetter to go to him and win his favour by speech.  Oftentimes, I\nween, does speech accomplish at need what prowess could hardly\ncatty through, smoothing the path in manner befitting.  And he\nonce welcomed noble Phrixus, a fugitive from his stepmother’s\nwiles and the sacrifice prepared by his father.  For all men\neverywhere, even the most shameless, reverence the ordinance of\nZeus, god of strangers, and regard it.”",
        "(ll. 194-209)  Thus he spake, and the youths approved the words\nof Aeson’s son with one accord, nor was there one to counsel\notherwise.  And then he summoned to go with him the sons of\nPhrixus, and Telamon and Augeias; and himself took Hermes’ wand;\nand at once they passed forth from the ship beyond the reeds and\nthe water to dry land, towards the rising ground of the plain.\nThe plain, I wis, is called Circe’s; and here in line grow many\nwillows and osiers, on whose topmost branches hang corpses bound\nwith cords.  For even now it is an abomination with the Colchians\nto burn dead men with fire; nor is it lawful to place them in the \nearth and raise a mound above, but to wrap them in untanned\noxhides and suspend them from trees far from the city.  And so\nearth has an equal portion with air, seeing that they bury the\nwomen; for that is the custom of their land.",
        "(ll. 210-259)  And as they went Hera with friendly thought spread\na thick mist through the city, that they might fare to the palace\nof Aeetes unseen by the countless hosts of the Colchians.  But\nsoon when from the plain they came to the city and Aeetes’\npalace, then again Hera dispersed the mist.  And they stood at\nthe entrance, marvelling at the king’s courts and the wide gates\nand columns which rose in ordered lines round the walls; and high\nup on the palace a coping of stone rested on brazen triglyphs.\nAnd silently they crossed the threshold.  And close by garden\nvines covered with green foliage were in full bloom, lifted high\nin air.  And beneath them ran four fountains, ever-flowing, which\nHephaestus had delved out.  One was gushing with milk, one with\nwine, while the third flowed with fragrant oil; and the fourth\nran with water, which grew warm at the setting of the Pleiads,\nand in turn at their rising bubbled forth from the hollow rock,\ncold as crystal.  Such then were the wondrous works that the\ncraftsman-god Hephaestus had fashioned in the palace of Cytaean\nAeetes.  And he wrought for him bulls with feet of bronze, and\ntheir mouths were of bronze, and from them they breathed out a\nterrible flame of fire; moreover he forged a plough of unbending\nadamant, all in one piece, in payment of thanks to Helios, who\nhad taken the god up in his chariot when faint from the\nPhlegraean fight. (1)  And here an inner-court was built, and\nround it were many well-fitted doors and chambers here and there,\nand all along on each side was a richly-wrought gallery.  And on\nboth sides loftier buildings stood obliquely.  In one, which was\nthe loftiest, lordly Aeetes dwelt with his queen; and in another\ndwelt Apsyrtus, son of Aeetes, whom a Caucasian nymph,\nAsterodeia, bare before he made Eidyia his wedded wife, the\nyoungest daughter of Tethys and Oceanus.  And the sons of the\nColchians called him by the new name of Phaethon, (2) because he\noutshone all the youths.  The other buildings the handmaidens\nhad, and the two daughters of Aeetes, Chalciope and Medea.  Medea\nthen [they found] going from chamber to chamber in search of her\nsister, for Hera detained her within that day; but beforetime she\nwas not wont to haunt the palace, but all day long was busied in\nHecate’s temple, since she herself was the priestess of the\ngoddess.  And when she saw them she cried aloud, and quickly\nChalciope caught the sound; and her maids, throwing down at their\nfeet their yarn and their thread, rushed forth all in a throng.\nAnd she, beholding her sons among them, raised her hands aloft\nthrough joy; and so they likewise greeted their mother, and when\nthey saw her embraced her in their gladness; and she with many\nsobs spoke thus:",
        "(ll. 260-267)  “After all then, ye were not destined to leave me\nin your heedlessness and to wander far; but fate has turned you\nback.  Poor wretch that I am!  What a yearning for Hellas from\nsome woeful madness seized you at the behest of your father\nPhrixus.  Bitter sorrows for my heart did he ordain when dying. \nAnd why should ye go to the city of Orchomenus, whoever this\nOrchomenus is, for the sake of Athamas’ wealth, leaving your\nmother alone to bear her grief?”",
        "(ll. 268-274)  Such were her words; and Aeetes came forth last of\nall and Eidyia herself came, the queen of Aeetes, on hearing the\nvoice of Chalciope; and straightway all the court was filled with\na throng.  Some of the thralls were busied with a mighty bull,\nothers with the axe were cleaving dry billets, and others heating\nwith fire water for the baths; nor was there one who relaxed his\ntoil, serving the king.",
        "(ll. 275-298)  Meantime Eros passed unseen through the grey mist,\ncausing confusion, as when against grazing heifers rises the\ngadfly, which oxherds call the breese.  And quickly beneath the\nlintel in the porch he strung his bow and took from the quiver an\narrow unshot before, messenger of pain.  And with swift feet\nunmarked he passed the threshold and keenly glanced around; and\ngliding close by Aeson’s son he laid the arrow-notch on the cord\nin the centre, and drawing wide apart with both hands he shot at\nMedea; and speechless amazement seized her soul.  But the god\nhimself flashed back again from the high-roofed hall, laughing\nloud; and the bolt burnt deep down in the maiden’s heart like a\nflame; and ever she kept darting bright glances straight up at\nAeson’s son, and within her breast her heart panted fast through\nanguish, all remembrance left her, and her soul melted with the\nsweet pain.  And as a poor woman heaps dry twigs round a blazing\nbrand–a daughter of toil, whose task is the spinning of wool,\nthat she may kindle a blaze at night beneath her roof, when she\nhas waked very early–and the flame waxing wondrous great from\nthe small brand consumes all the twigs together; so, coiling\nround her heart, burnt secretly Love the destroyer; and the hue\nof her soft cheeks went and came, now pale, now red, in her\nsoul’s distraction.",
        "(ll. 299-303)  Now when the thralls had laid a banquet ready\nbefore them, and they had refreshed themselves with warm baths,\ngladly did they please their souls with meat and drink.  And\nthereafter Aeetes questioned the sons of his daughter, addressing\nthem with these words:",
        "(ll. 304-316)  “Sons of my daughter and of Phrixus, whom beyond\nall strangers I honoured in my halls, how have ye come returning\nback to Aea?  Did some calamity cut short your escape in the\nmidst?  Ye did not listen when I set before you the boundless\nlength of the way.  For I marked it once, whirled along in the\nchariot of my father Helios, when he was bringing my sister Circe\nto the western land and we came to the shore of the Tyrrhenian\nmainland, where even now she abides, exceeding far from Colchis.\nBut what pleasure is there in words?  Do ye tell me plainly what\nhas been your fortune, and who these men are, your companions,\nand where from your hollow ship ye came ashore.”",
        "(ll. 317-319)  Such were his questions, and Argus, before all his\nbrethren, being fearful for the mission of Aeson’s son, gently\nreplied, for he was the elder-born:",
        "(ll. 320-366)  “Aeetes, that ship forthwith stormy blasts tore\nasunder, and ourselves, crouching on the beams, a wave drove on\nto the beach of the isle of Enyalius (3) in the murky night; and\nsome god preserved us.  For even the birds of Ares that haunted\nthe desert isle beforetime, not even them did we find.  But these\nmen had driven them off, having landed from their ship on the day\nbefore; and the will of Zeus taking pity on us, or some fate,\ndetained them there, since they straightway gave us both food and\nclothing in abundance, when they heard the illustrious name of\nPhrixus and thine own; for to thy city are they faring.  And if\nthou dost wish to know their errand, I will not hide it from\ntime.  A certain king, vehemently longing to drive this man far\nfrom his fatherland and possessions, because in might he outshone\nall the sons of Aeolus, sends him to voyage hither on a bootless\nventure; and asserts that the stock of Aeolus will not escape the\nheart-grieving wrath and rage of implacable Zeus, nor the\nunbearable curse and vengeance due for Phrixus, until the fleece\ncomes back to Hellas.  And their ship was fashioned by Pallas\nAthena, not such a one as are the ships among the Colchians, on\nthe vilest of which we chanced.  For the fierce waves and wind\nbroke her utterly to pieces; but the other holds firm with her\nbolts, even though all the blasts should buffet her.  And with\nequal swiftness she speedeth before the wind and when the crew\nply the oar with unresting hands.  And he hath gathered in her\nthe mightiest heroes of all Achaea, and hath come to thy city\nfrom wandering far through cities and gulfs of the dread ocean,\nin the hope that thou wilt grant him the fleece.  But as thou\ndost please, so shall it be, for he cometh not to use force, but\nis eager to pay thee a recompense for the gift.  He has heard\nfrom me of thy bitter foes the Sauromatae, and he will subdue\nthem to thy sway.  And if thou desirest to know their names and\nlineage I will tell thee all.  This man on whose account the rest\nwere gathered from Hellas, they call Jason, son of Aeson, whom\nCretheus begat.  And if in truth he is of the stock of Cretheus\nhimself, thus he would be our kinsman on the father’s side.  For\nCretheus and Athamas were both sons of Aeolus; and Phrixus was\nthe son of Athamas, son of Aeolus.  And here, if thou hast heard\nat all of the seed of Helios, thou dost behold Augeias; and this\nis Telamon sprung from famous Aeacus; and Zeus himself begat\nAeacus.  And so all the rest, all the comrades that follow him,\nare the sons or grandsons of the immortals.”",
        "(ll. 367-371)  Such was the tale of Argus; but the king at his\nwords was filled with rage as he heard; and his heart was lifted\nhigh in wrath.  And he spake in heavy displeasure; and was\nangered most of all with the son of Chalciope; for he deemed that\non their account the strangers had come; and in his fury his eyes\nflashed forth beneath his brows:",
        "(ll. 372-381)  “Begone from my sight, felons, straightway, ye and\nyour tricks, from the land, ere someone see a fleece and a\nPhrixus to his sorrow.  Banded together with your friends from\nHellas, not for the fleece, but to seize my sceptre and royal\npower have ye come hither.  Had ye not first tasted of my table,\nsurely would I have cut out your tongues and hewn off both hands\nand sent you forth with your feet alone, so that ye might be\nstayed from starting hereafter.  And what lies have ye uttered\nagainst the blessed gods!”",
        "(ll. 382-385)  Thus he spake in his wrath; and mightily from its\ndepths swelled the heart of Aeacus’ son, and his soul within\nlonged to speak a deadly word in defiance, but Aeson’s son\nchecked him, for he himself first made gentle answer:",
        "(ll. 386-395)  “Aeetes, bear with this armed band, I pray.  For\nnot in the way thou deemest have we come to thy city and palace,\nno, nor yet with such desires.  For who would of his own will\ndare to cross so wide a sea for the goods of a stranger?  But\nfate and the ruthless command of a presumptuous king urged me.\nGrant a favour to thy suppliants, and to all Hellas will I\npublish a glorious fame of thee; yea, we are ready now to pay\nthee a swift recompense in war, whether it be the Sauromatae or\nsome other people that thou art eager to subdue to thy sway.”",
        "(ll. 396-400)  He spake, flattering him with gentle utterance;\nbut the king’s soul brooded a twofold purpose within him, whether\nhe should attack and slay them on the spot or should make trial\nof their might.  And this, as he pondered, seemed the better way,\nand he addressed Jason in answer:",
        "(ll. 401-421)  “Stranger, why needest thou go through thy tale to\nthe end?  For if ye are in truth of heavenly race, or have come\nin no wise inferior to me, to win the goods of strangers, I will\ngive thee the fleece to bear away, if thou dost wish, when I have\ntried thee.  For against brave men I bear no grudge, such as ye\nyourselves tell me of him who bears sway in Hellas.  And the\ntrial of your courage and might shall be a contest which I myself\ncan compass with my hands, deadly though it be.  Two bulls with\nfeet of bronze I have that pasture on the plain of Ares,\nbreathing forth flame from their jaws; them do I yoke and drive\nover the stubborn field of Ares, four plough-gates; and quickly\ncleaving it with the share up to the headland, I cast into the\nfurrows the seed, not the corn of Demeter, but the teeth of a\ndread serpent that grow up into the fashion of armed men; them I\nslay at once, cutting them down beneath my spear as they rise\nagainst me on all sides.  In the morning do I yoke the oxen, and\nat eventide I cease from the harvesting.  And thou, if thou wilt\naccomplish such deeds as these, on that very day shalt carry off\nthe fleece to the king’s palace; ere that time comes I will not\ngive it, expect it not.  For indeed it is unseemly that a brave\nman should yield to a coward.”",
        "(ll. 422-426)  Thus he spake; and Jason, fixing his eyes on the\nground, sat just as he was, speechless, helpless in his evil\nplight.  For a long time he turned the matter this way and that,\nand could in no way take on him the task with courage, for a\nmighty task it seemed; and at last he made reply with crafty\nwords:",
        "(ll. 427-431)  “With thy plea of right, Aeetes, thou dost shut me\nin overmuch.  Wherefore also I will dare that contest, monstrous\nas it is, though it be my doom to die. For nothing will fall upon\nmen more dread than dire necessity, which indeed constrained me\nto come hither at a king’s command.”",
        "(ll. 432-438)  Thus he spake, smitten by his helpless plight; and\nthe king with grim words addressed him, sore troubled as he was:\n\"Go forth now to the gathering, since thou art eager for the\ntoil; but if thou shouldst fear to lift the yoke upon the oxen or\nshrink from the deadly harvesting, then all this shall be my\ncare, so that another too may shudder to come to a man that is\nbetter than he.”",
        "(ll. 439-463)  He spake outright; and Jason rose from his seat,\nand Augeias and Telamon at once; and Argus followed alone, for he\nsigned to his brothers to stay there on the spot meantime; and so\nthey went forth from the hall.  And wonderfully among them all\nshone the son of Aeson for beauty and grace; and the maiden\nlooked at him with stealthy glance, holding her bright veil\naside, her heart smouldering with pain; and her soul creeping\nlike a dream flitted in his track as he went.  So they passed\nforth from the palace sorely troubled.  And Chalciope, shielding\nherself from the wrath of Aeetes, had gone quickly to her chamber\nwith her sons.  And Medea likewise followed, and much she brooded\nin her soul all the cares that the Loves awaken.  And before her\neyes the vision still appeared–himself what like he was, with\nwhat vesture he was clad, what things he spake, how he sat on his\nseat, how he moved forth to the door–and as she pondered she\ndeemed there never was such another man; and ever in her ears\nrung his voice and the honey-sweet words which he uttered.  And\nshe feared for him, lest the oxen or Aeetes with his own hand\nshould slay him; and she mourned him as though already slain\noutright, and in her affliction a round tear through very\ngrievous pity coursed down her cheek; and gently weeping she\nlifted up her voice aloud:",
        "(ll. 464-470)  Why does this grief come upon me, poor wretch?\nWhether he be the best of heroes now about to perish, or the\nworst, let him go to his doom.  Yet I would that he had escaped\nunharmed; yea, may this be so, revered goddess, daughter of\nPerses, may he avoid death and return home; but if it be his lot\nto be o’ermastered by the oxen, may he first learn this, that I\nat least do not rejoice in his cruel calamity.”",
        "(ll. 471-474)  Thus then was the maiden’s heart racked by love-\ncares.  But when the others had gone forth from the people and\nthe city, along the path by which at the first they had come from\nthe plain, then Argus addressed Jason with these words:",
        "(ll. 475-483)  “Son of Aeson, thou wilt despise the counsel which\nI will tell thee, but, though in evil plight, it is not fitting\nto forbear from the trial.  Ere now thou hast heard me tell of a\nmaiden that uses sorcery under the guidance of Hecate, Perses’\ndaughter.  If we could win her aid there will be no dread,\nmethinks, of thy defeat in the contest; but terribly do I fear\nthat my mother will not take this task upon her.  Nevertheless I\nwill go back again to entreat her, for a common destruction\noverhangs us all.”",
        "(ll. 383-491)  He spake with goodwill, and Jason answered with\nthese words: “Good friend, if this is good in thy sight, I say\nnot nay.  Go and move thy mother, beseeching her aid with prudent\nwords; pitiful indeed is our hope when we have put our return in\nthe keeping of women.”  So he spake, and quickly they reached the\nback-water.  And their comrades joyfully questioned them, when\nthey saw them close at hand; and to them spoke Aeson’s son\ngrieved at heart:",
        "(ll. 492-501)  “My friends, the heart of ruthless Aeetes is\nutterly filled with wrath against us, for not at all can the goal\nbe reached either by me or by you who question me.  He said that\ntwo bulls with feet of bronze pasture on the plain of Ares,\nbreathing forth flame from their jaws.  And with these he bade me\nplough the field, four plough-gates; and said that he would give\nme from a serpent’s jaws seed which will raise up earthborn men\nin armour of bronze; and on the same day I must slay them.  This\ntask–for there was nothing better to devise–I took on\nmyself outright.”",
        "(ll. 502-514)  Thus he spake; and to all the contest seemed one\nthat none could accomplish, and long, quiet and silent, they\nlooked at one another, bowed down with the calamity and their\ndespair; but at last Peleus spake with courageous words among all\nthe chiefs: “It is time to be counselling what we shall do.  Yet\nthere is not so much profit, I trow, in counsel as in the might\nof our hands.  If thou then, hero son of Aeson, art minded to\nyoke Aeetes’ oxen, and art eager for the toil, surely thou wilt\nkeep thy promise and make thyself ready.  But if thy soul trusts\nnot her prowess utterly, then neither bestir thyself nor sit\nstill and look round for some one else of these men.  For it is\nnot I who will flinch, since the bitterest pain will be but\ndeath.”",
        "(ll. 515-522)  So spake the son of Aeacus; and Telamon’s soul was\nstirred, and quickly he started up in eagerness; and Idas rose up\nthe third in his pride; and the twin sons of Tyndareus; and with\nthem Oeneus’ son who was numbered among strong men, though even\nthe soft down on his cheek showed not yet; with such courage was\nhis soul uplifted.  But the others gave way to these in silence.\nAnd straightway Argus spake these words to those that longed for\nthe contest:",
        "(ll. 523-539)  “My friends, this indeed is left us at the last.\nBut I deem that there will come to you some timely aid from my\nmother.  Wherefore, eager though ye be, refrain and abide in your\nship a little longer as before, for it is better to forbear than\nrecklessly to choose an evil fate.  There is a maiden, nurtured\nin the halls of Aeetes, whom the goddess Hecate taught to handle\nmagic herbs with exceeding skill all that the land and flowing\nwaters produce.  With them is quenched the blast of unwearied\nflame, and at once she stays the course of rivers as they rush\nroaring on, and checks the stars and the paths of the sacred\nmoon.  Of her we bethought us as we came hither along the path\nfrom the palace, if haply my mother, her own sister, might\npersuade her to aid us in the venture.  And if this is pleasing\nto you as well, surely on this very day will I return to the\npalace of Aeetes to make trial; and perchance with some god’s\nhelp shall I make the trial.”",
        "(ll. 540-544)  Thus he spake, and the gods in their goodwill gave\nthem a sign.  A trembling dove in her flight from a mighty hawk\nfell from on high, terrified, into the lap of Aeson’s son, and\nthe hawk fell impaled on the stern-ornament.  And quickly Mopsus\nwith prophetic words spake among them all:",
        "(ll. 545-554)  “For you, friends, this sign has been wrought by\nthe will of heaven; in no other way is it possible to interpret\nits meaning better, than to seek out the maiden and entreat her\nwith manifold skill.  And I think she will not reject our prayer,\nif in truth Phineus said that our return should be with the help\nof the Cyprian goddess.  It was her gentle bird that escaped\ndeath; and as my heart within me foresees according to this omen,\nso may it prove!  But, my friends, let us call on Cytherea to aid\nus, and now at once obey the counsels of Argus.”",
        "(ll. 555-563)  He spake, and the warriors approved, remembering\nthe injunctions of Phineus; but all alone leapt up Apharcian Idas\nand shouted loudly in terrible wrath: “Shame on us, have we come\nhere fellow voyagers with women, calling on Cypris for help and\nnot on the mighty strength of Enyalius?  And do ye look to doves\nand hawks to save yourselves from contests?  Away with you, take\nthought not for deeds of war, but by supplication to beguile\nweakling girls.”",
        "(ll. 564-571)  Such were his eager words; and of his comrades\nmany murmured low, but none uttered a word of answer back.  And\nhe sat down in wrath; and at once Jason roused them and uttered\nhis own thought: “Let Argus set forth from the ship, since this\npleases all; but we will now move from the river and openly\nfasten our hawsers to the shore.  For surely it is not fitting\nfor us to hide any longer cowering from the battle-cry.”",
        "(ll. 572-575)  So he spake, and straightway sent Argus to return\nin haste to the city; and they drew the anchors on board at the\ncommand of Aeson’s son, and rowed the ship close to the shore, a\nlittle away from the back-water.",
        "(ll. 576-608)  But straightway Aeetes held an assembly of the\nColchians far aloof from his palace at a spot where they sat in\ntimes before, to devise against the Minyae grim treachery and\ntroubles.  And he threatened that when first the oxen should have\ntorn in pieces the man who had taken upon him to perform the\nheavy task, he would hew down the oak grove above the wooded\nhill, and burn the ship and her crew, that so they might vent\nforth in ruin their grievous insolence, for all their haughty\nschemes.  For never would he have welcomed the Aeolid Phrixus as\na guest in his halls, in spite of his sore need, Phrixus, who\nsurpassed all strangers in gentleness and fear of the gods, had\nnot Zeus himself sent Hermes his messenger down from heaven, so\nthat he might meet with a friendly host; much less would pirates\ncoming to his land be let go scatheless for long, men whose care\nit was to lift their hands and seize the goods of others, and to\nweave secret webs of guile, and harry the steadings of herdsmen\nwith ill-sounding forays.  And he said that besides all that the\nsons of Phrixus should pay a fitting penalty to himself for\nreturning in consort with evildoers, that they might recklessly\ndrive him from his honour and his throne; for once he had heard a\nbaleful prophecy from his father Helios, that he must avoid the\nsecret treachery and schemes of his own offspring and their\ncrafty mischief.  Wherefore he was sending them, as they desired,\nto the Achaean land at the bidding of their father–a long\njourney.  Nor had he ever so slight a fear of his daughters, that\nthey would form some hateful scheme, nor of his son Apsyrtus; but\nthis curse was being fulfilled in the children of Chalciope.  And\nhe proclaimed terrible things in his rage against the strangers,\nand loudly threatened to keep watch over the ship and its crew,\nso that no one might escape calamity.",
        "(ll. 609-615)  Meantime Argus, going to Aeetes’ palace, with\nmanifold pleading besought his mother to pray Medea’s aid; and\nChalciope herself already had the same thoughts, but fear checked\nher soul lest haply either fate should withstand and she should\nentreat her in vain, all distraught as she would be at her\nfather’s deadly wrath, or, if Medea yielded to her prayers, her\ndeeds should be laid bare and open to view.",
        "(ll. 616-635)  Now a deep slumber had relieved the maiden from\nher love-pains as she lay upon her couch.  But straightway\nfearful dreams, deceitful, such as trouble one in grief, assailed\nher.  And she thought that the stranger had taken on him the\ncontest, not because he longed to win the ram’s fleece, and that\nhe had not come on that account to Aeetes’ city, but to lead her\naway, his wedded wife, to his own home; and she dreamed that\nherself contended with the oxen and wrought the task with\nexceeding ease; and that her own parents set at naught their\npromise, for it was not the maiden they had challenged to yoke\nthe oxen but the stranger himself; from that arose a contention\nof doubtful issue between her father and the strangers; and both\nlaid the decision upon her, to be as she should direct in her\nmind.  But she suddenly, neglecting her parents, chose the\nstranger.  And measureless anguish seized them and they shouted\nout in their wrath; and with the cry sleep released its hold upon\nher.  Quivering with fear she started up, and stared round the \nwalls of her chamber, and with difficulty did she gather her\nspirit within her as before, and lifted her voice aloud:",
        "(ll. 636-644)  “Poor wretch, how have gloomy dreams affrighted\nme!  I fear that this voyage of the heroes will bring some great\nevil.  My heart is trembling for the stranger.  Let him woo some\nAchaean girl far away among his own folk; let maidenhood be mine\nand the home of my parents.  Yet, taking to myself a reckless\nheart, I will no more keep aloof but will make trial of my sister\nto see if she will entreat me to aid in the contest, through\ngrief for her own sons; this would quench the bitter pain in my\nheart.”",
        "(ll. 645-673)  She spake, and rising from her bed opened the door\nof her chamber, bare-footed, clad in one robe; and verily she\ndesired to go to her sister, and crossed the threshold.  And for\nlong she stayed there at the entrance of her chamber, held back\nby shame; and she turned back once more; and again she came forth\nfrom within, and again stole back; and idly did her feet bear her\nthis way and that; yea, as oft as she went straight on, shame\nheld her within the chamber, and though held back by shame, bold\ndesire kept urging her on.  Thrice she made the attempt and\nthrice she checked herself, the fourth time she fell on her bed\nface downward, writhing in pain.  And as when a bride in her\nchamber bewails her youthful husband, to whom her brothers and\nparents have given her, nor yet does she hold converse with all\nher attendants for shame and for thinking of him; but she sits\napart in her grief; and some doom has destroyed him, before they\nhave had pleasure of each other’s charms; and she with heart on\nfire silently weeps, beholding her widowed couch, in fear lest\nthe women should mock and revile her; like to her did Medea\nlament.  And suddenly as she was in the midst of her tears, one\nof the handmaids came forth and noticed her, one who was her\nyouthful attendant; and straightway she told Chalciope, who sat\nin the midst of her sons devising how to win over her sister. \nAnd when Chalciope heard the strange tale from the handmaid, not\neven so did she disregard it.  And she rushed in dismay from her\nchamber right on to the chamber where the maiden lay in her\nanguish, having torn her cheeks on each side; and when Chalciope\nsaw her eyes all dimmed with tears, she thus addressed her:",
        "(ll. 674-680)  “Ah me, Medea, why dost thou weep so?  What hath\nbefallen thee?  What terrible grief has entered thy heart?  Has\nsome heaven-sent disease enwrapt thy frame, or hast thou heard\nfrom our father some deadly threat concerning me and my sons?\nWould that I did not behold this home of my parents, or the city,\nbut dwelt at the ends of the earth, where not even the name of\nColchians is known!”",
        "(ll. 681-687)  Thus she spake, and her sister’s cheeks flushed;\nand though she was eager to reply, long did maiden shame restrain\nher.  At one moment the word rose on the end of her tongue, at\nanother it fluttered back deep within her breast.  And often\nthrough her lovely lips it strove for utterance; but no sound\ncame forth; till at last she spoke with guileful words; for the\nbold Loves were pressing her hard:",
        "(ll. 688-692)  “Chalciope, my heart is all trembling for thy\nsons, lest my father forthwith destroy them together with the\nstrangers.  Slumbering just now in a short-lived sleep such a\nghastly dream did I see–may some god forbid its fulfilment and\nnever mayst thou win for thyself bitter care on thy sons’\naccount.”",
        "(ll. 693-704)  She spake, making trial of her sister to see if\nshe first would entreat help for her sons.  And utterly\nunbearable grief surged over Chalciope’s soul for fear at what\nshe heard; and then she replied: “Yea, I myself too have come to\nthee in eager furtherance of this purpose, if thou wouldst haply\ndevise with me and prepare some help.  But swear by Earth and\nHeaven that thou wilt keep secret in thy heart what I shall tell\nthee, and be fellow-worker with me.  I implore thee by the\nblessed gods, by thyself and by thy parents, not to see them\ndestroyed by an evil doom piteously; or else may I die with my\ndear sons and come back hereafter from Hades an avenging Fury to\nhaunt thee.”",
        "(ll. 705-710)  Thus she spake, and straightway a torrent of tears\ngushed forth and low down she clasped her sister’s knees with\nboth hands and let her head sink on to her breast.  Then they\nboth made piteous lamentation over each other, and through the\nhalls rose the faint sound of women weeping in anguish.  Medea,\nsore troubled, first addressed her sister:",
        "(ll. 711-717)  “God help thee, what healing can I bring thee for\nwhat thou speakest of, horrible curses and Furies?  Would that it\nwere firmly in my power to save thy sons!  Be witness that mighty\noath of the Colchians by which thou urgest me to swear, the great\nHeaven, and Earth beneath, mother of the gods, that as far as\nstrength lies in me, never shalt thou fail of help, if only thy\nprayers can be accomplished.”",
        "(ll. 718-723)  She spake, and Chalciope thus replied: “Couldst\nthou not then, for the stranger–who himself craves thy aid –\ndevise some trick or some wise thought to win the contest, for\nthe sake of my sons?  And from him has come Argus urging me to\ntry to win thy help; I left him in the palace meantime while I\ncame hither.”",
        "(ll. 724-739)  Thus she spake, and Medea’s heart bounded with joy\nwithin her, and at once her fair cheeks flushed, and a mist swam\nbefore her melting eyes, and she spake as follows: “Chalciope, as\nis dear and delightful to thee and thy sons, even so will I do.\nNever may the dawn appear again to my eyes, never mayst thou see\nme living any longer, if I should take thought for anything\nbefore thy life or thy sons’ lives, for they are my brothers, my\ndear kinsmen and youthful companions.  So do I declare myself to\nbe thy sister, and thy daughter too, for thou didst lift me to\nthy breast when an infant equally with them, as I ever heard from\nmy mother in past days.  But go, bury my kindness in silence, so\nthat I may carry out my promise unknown to my parents; and at\ndawn I will bring to Hecate’s temple charms to cast a spell upon\nthe bulls.”",
        "(ll. 740-743)  Thus Chalciope went back from the chamber, and\nmade known to her sons the help given by her sister.  And again\ndid shame and hateful fear seize Medea thus left alone, that she\nshould devise such deeds for a man in her father’s despite.",
        "(ll. 744-771)  Then did night draw darkness over the earth; and\non the sea sailors from their ships looked towards the Bear and\nthe stars of Orion; and now the wayfarer and the warder longed\nfor sleep, and the pall of slumber wrapped round the mother whose\nchildren were dead; nor was there any more the barking of dogs\nthrough the city, nor sound of men’s voices; but silence held the\nblackening gloom.  But not indeed upon Medea came sweet sleep.\nFor in her love for Aeson’s son many cares kept her wakeful, and\nshe dreaded the mighty strength of the bulls, beneath whose fury\nhe was like to perish by an unseemly fate in the field of Ares.\nAnd fast did her heart throb within her breast, as a sunbeam\nquivers upon the walls of a house when flung up from water, which\nis just poured forth in a caldron or a pail may be; and hither\nand thither on the swift eddy does it dart and dance along; even\nso the maiden’s heart quivered in her breast.  And the tear of\npity flowed from her eyes, and ever within anguish tortured her,\na smouldering fire through her frame, and about her fine nerves\nand deep down beneath the nape of the neck where the pain enters\nkeenest, whenever the unwearied Loves direct against the heart\ntheir shafts of agony.  And she thought now that she would give\nhim the charms to cast a spell on the bulls, now that she would\nnot, and that she herself would perish; and again that she would\nnot perish and would not give the charms, but just as she was\nwould endure her fate in silence.  Then sitting down she wavered\nin mind and said:",
        "(ll. 772-801)  “Poor wretch, must I toss hither and thither in\nwoe?  On every side my heart is in despair; nor is there any help\nfor my pain; but it burneth ever thus.  Would that I had been\nslain by the swift shafts of Artemis before I had set eyes on\nhim, before Chalciope’s sons reached the Achaean land.  Some god\nor some Fury brought them hither for our grief, a cause of many\ntears.  Let him perish in the contest if it be his lot to die in\nthe field.  For how could I prepare the charms without my\nparents’ knowledge?  What story call I tell them?  What trick,\nwhat cunning device for aid can I find?  If I see him alone,\napart from his comrades, shall I greet him?  Ill-starred that I\nam!  I cannot hope that I should rest from my sorrows even though\nhe perished; then will evil come to me when he is bereft of life.\nPerish all shame, perish all glow; may he, saved by my effort, go\nscatheless wherever his heart desires.  But as for me, on the day\nwhen he bides the contest in triumph, may I die either straining\nmy neck in the noose from the roof-tree or tasting drugs\ndestructive of life.  But even so, when I am dead, they will\nfling out taunts against me; and every city far away will ring\nwith my doom, and the Colchian women, tossing my name on their\nlips hither and thither, will revile me with unseemly mocking –\nthe maid who cared so much for a stranger that she died, the maid\nwho disgraced her home and her parents, yielding to a mad\npassion.  And what disgrace will not be mine?  Alas for my\ninfatuation!  Far better would it be for me to forsake life this\nvery night in my chamber by some mysterious fate, escaping all\nslanderous reproach, before I complete such nameless dishonour.”",
        "(ll. 802-824)  She spake, and brought a casket wherein lay many\ndrugs, some for healing, others for killing, and placing it upon\nher knees she wept.  And she drenched her bosom with ceaseless\ntears, which flowed in torrents as she sat, bitterly bewailing\nher own fate.  And she longed to choose a murderous drug to taste\nit, and now she was loosening the bands of the casket eager to\ntake it forth, unhappy maid!  But suddenly a deadly fear of\nhateful Hades came upon her heart.  And long she held back in\nspeechless horror, and all around her thronged visions of the\npleasing cares of life.  She thought of all the delightful things\nthat are among the living, she thought of her joyous playmates,\nas a maiden will; and the sun grew sweeter than ever to behold,\nseeing that in truth her soul yearned for all.  And she put the\ncasket again from off her knees, all changed by the prompting of\nHera, and no more did she waver in purpose; but longed for the\nrising dawn to appear quickly, that she might give him the charms\nto work the spell as she had promised, and meet him face to face.\nAnd often did she loosen the bolts of her door, to watch for the\nfaint gleam: and welcome to her did the dayspring shed its light,\nand folk began to stir throughout the city.",
        "(ll. 825-827)  Then Argus bade his brothers remain there to learn\nthe maiden’s mind and plans, but himself turned back and went to\nthe ship.",
        "(ll. 828-890)  Now soon as ever the maiden saw the light of dawn,\nwith her hands she gathered up her golden tresses which were\nfloating round her shoulders in careless disarray, and bathed her\ntear-stained cheeks, and made her skin shine with ointment sweet\nas nectar; and she donned a beautiful robe, fitted with well-bent\nclasps, and above on her head, divinely fair, she threw a veil\ngleaming like silver.  And there, moving to and fro in the\npalace, she trod the ground forgetful of the heaven-sent woes\nthronging round her and of others that were destined to follow.\nAnd she called to her maids.  Twelve they were, who lay during\nthe night in the vestibule of her fragrant chamber, young as\nherself, not yet sharing the bridal couch, and she bade them\nhastily yoke the mules to the chariot to bear her to the\nbeauteous shrine of Hecate.  Thereupon the handmaids were making\nready the chariot; and Medea meanwhile took from the hollow\ncasket a charm which men say is called the charm of Prometheus.\nIf a man should anoint his body therewithal, having first\nappeased the Maiden, the only-begotten, with sacrifice by night,\nsurely that man could not be wounded by the stroke of bronze nor\nwould he flinch from blazing fire; but for that day he would\nprove superior both in prowess and in might.  It shot up first-\nborn when the ravening eagle on the rugged flanks of Caucasus let\ndrip to the earth the blood-like ichor of tortured Prometheus.\nAnd its flower appeared a cubit above ground in colour like the\nCorycian crocus, rising on twin stalks; but in the earth the root\nwas like newly-cut flesh.  The dark juice of it, like the sap of\na mountain-oak, she had gathered in a Caspian shell to make the\ncharm withal, when she had first bathed in seven ever-flowing\nstreams, and had called seven times on Brimo, nurse of youth,\nnight-wandering Brimo, of the underworld, queen among the dead,\n– in the gloom of night, clad in dusky garments.  And beneath,\nthe dark earth shook and bellowed when the Titanian root was cut;\nand the son of Iapetus himself groaned, his soul distraught with\npain.  And she brought the charm forth and placed it in the\nfragrant band which engirdled her, just beneath her bosom,\ndivinely fair.  And going forth she mounted the swift chariot,\nand with her went two handmaidens on each side.  And she herself\ntook the reins and in her right hand the well-fashioned whip, and\ndrove through the city; and the rest, the handmaids, laid their\nhands on the chariot behind and ran along the broad highway; and\nthey kilted up their light robes above their white knees.  And\neven as by the mild waters of Parthenius, or after bathing in the\nriver Amnisus, Leto’s daughter stands upon her golden chariot and\ncourses over the hills with her swift-footed roes, to greet from\nafar some richly-steaming hecatomb; and with her come the nymphs\nin attendance, gathering, some at the spring of Amnisus itself,\nothers by the glens and many-fountained peaks; and round her\nwhine and fawn the beasts cowering as she moves along: thus they\nsped through the city; and on both sides the people gave way,\nshunning the eyes of the royal maiden.  But when she had left the\ncity’s well paved streets, and was approaching the shrine as she\ndrove over the plains, then she alighted eagerly from the smooth-\nrunning chariot and spake as follows among her maidens:",
        "(ll. 891-911)  “Friends, verily have I sinned greatly and took no\nheed not to go among the stranger-folk 1 who roam over our land.\nThe whole city is smitten with dismay; wherefore no one of the\nwomen who formerly gathered here day by day has now come hither.\nBut since we have come and no one else draws near, come, let us\nsatisfy our souls without stint with soothing song, and when we\nhave plucked the fair flowers amid the tender grass, that very\nhour will we return.  And with many a gift shall ye reach home\nthis very day, if ye will gladden me with this desire of mine.\nFor Argus pleads with me, also Chalciope herself; but this that\nye hear from me keep silently in your hearts, lest the tale reach\nmy father’s ears.  As for yon stranger who took on him the task\nwith the oxen, they bid me receive his gifts and rescue him from\nthe deadly contest.  And I approved their counsel, and I have\nsummoned him to come to my presence apart from his comrades, so\nthat we may divide the gifts among ourselves if he bring them in\nhis hands, and in return may give him a baleful charm.  But when\nhe comes, do ye stand aloof.”",
        "(ll. 912-918)  So she spake, and the crafty counsel pleased them\nall.  And straightway Argus drew Aeson’s son apart from his\ncomrades as soon as he heard from his brothers that Medea had\ngone at daybreak to the holy shrine of Hecate, and led him over\nthe plain; and with them went Mopsus, son of Ampycus, skilled to\nutter oracles from the appearance of birds, and skilled to give\ngood counsel to those who set out on a journey.",
        "(ll. 919-926)  Never yet had there been such a man in the days of\nold, neither of all the heroes of the lineage of Zeus himself,\nnor of those who sprung from the blood of the other gods, as on\nthat day the bride of Zeus made Jason, both to look upon and to\nhold converse with.  Even his comrades wondered as they gazed\nupon him, radiant with manifold graces; and the son of Ampycus\nrejoiced in their journey, already foreboding how all would end.",
        "(ll. 927-931)  Now by the path along the plain there stands near\nthe shrine a poplar with its crown of countless leaves, whereon\noften chattering crows would roost.  One of them meantime as she\nclapped her wings aloft in the branches uttered the counsels of\nHera:",
        "(ll. 932-937)  “What a pitiful seer is this, that has not the wit\nto conceive even what children know, how that no maiden will say\na word of sweetness or love to a youth when strangers be near.\nBegone, sorry prophet, witless one; on thee neither Cypris nor\nthe gentle Loves breathe in their kindness.”",
        "(ll. 938-946)  She spake chiding, and Mopsus smiled to hear the\ngod-sent voice of the bird, and thus addressed them: “Do thou,\nson of Aeson, pass on to the temple, where thou wilt find the\nmaiden; and very kind will her greeting be to thee through the\nprompting of Cypris, who will be thy helpmate in the contest,\neven as Phineus, Agenor’s son, foretold.  But we two, Argus and\nI, will await thy return, apart in this very spot; do thou all\nalone be a suppliant and win her over with prudent words.”",
        "(ll. 947-974)  He spake wisely, and both at once gave approval.\nNor was Medea’s heart turned to other thoughts, for all her\nsinging, and never a song that she essayed pleased her long in\nher sport.  But in confusion she ever faltered, nor did she keep\nher eyes resting quietly upon the throng of her handmaids; but to\nthe paths far off she strained her gaze, turning her face aside.\nOft did her heart sink fainting within her bosom whenever she\nfancied she heard passing by the sound of a footfall or of the\nwind.  But soon he appeared to her longing eyes, striding along\nloftily, like Sirius coming from ocean, which rises fair and\nclear to see, but brings unspeakable mischief to flocks; thus\nthen did Aeson’s son come to her, fair to see, but the sight of\nhim brought love-sick care.  Her heart fell from out her bosom,\nand a dark mist came over her eyes, and a hot blush covered her\ncheeks.  And she had no strength to lift her knees backwards or\nforwards, but her feet beneath were rooted to the ground; and\nmeantime all her handmaidens had drawn aside.  So they two stood\nface to face without a word, without a sound, like oaks or lofty\npines, which stand quietly side by side on the mountains when the\nwind is still; then again, when stirred by the breath of the\nwind, they murmur ceaselessly; so they two were destined to tell\nout all their tale, stirred by the breath of Love.  And Aeson’s\nson saw that she had fallen into some heaven-sent calamity, and\nwith soothing words thus addressed her:",
        "(ll. 975-1007)  “Why, pray, maiden, dost thou fear me so much,\nall alone as I am?  Never was I one of these idle boasters such\nas other men are–not even aforetime, when I dwelt in my own\ncountry.  Wherefore, maiden, be not too much abashed before me,\neither to enquire whatever thou wilt or to speak thy mind.  But\nsince we have met one another with friendly hearts, in a hallowed\nspot, where it is wrong to sin, speak openly and ask questions,\nand beguile me not with pleasing words, for at the first thou\ndidst promise thy sister to give me the charms my heart desires.\nI implore thee by Hecate herself, by thy parents, and by Zeus who\nholds his guardian hand over strangers and suppliants; I come\nhere to thee both a suppliant and a stranger, bending the knee in\nmy sore need.  For without thee and thy sister never shall I\nprevail in the grievous contest.  And to thee will I render\nthanks hereafter for thy aid, as is right and fitting for men who\ndwell far oft, making glorious thy name and fame; and the rest of\nthe heroes, returning to Hellas, will spread thy renown and so\nwill the heroes’ wives and mothers, who now perhaps are sitting\non the shore and making moan for us; their painful affliction\nthou mightest scatter to the winds.  In days past the maiden\nAriadne, daughter of Minos, with kindly intent rescued Theseus\nfrom grim contests–the maiden whom Pasiphae daughter of Helios\nbare.  But she, when Minos had lulled his wrath to rest, went\naboard the ship with him and left her fatherland; and her even\nthe immortal gods loved, and, as a sign in mid-sky, a crown of\nstars, which men call Ariadne’s crown, rolls along all night\namong the heavenly constellations.  So to thee too shall be\nthanks from the gods, if thou wilt save so mighty an array of\nchieftains.  For surely from thy lovely form thou art like to\nexcel in gentle courtest.”",
        "(ll. 1008-1025)  Thus he spake, honouring her; and she cast her\neyes down with a smile divinely sweet; and her soul melted within\nher, uplifted by his praise, and she gazed upon him face to face;\nnor did she know what word to utter first, but was eager to pour\nout everything at once.  And forth from her fragrant girdle\nungrudgingly she brought out the charm; and he at once received\nit in his hands with joy.  And she would even have drawn out all\nher soul from her breast and given it to him, exulting in his\ndesire; so wonderfully did love flash forth a sweet flame from\nthe golden head of Aeson’s son; and he captivated her gleaming\neyes; and her heart within grew warm, melting away as the dew\nmelts away round roses when warmed by the morning’s light.  And\nnow both were fixing their eyes on the ground abashed, and again\nwere throwing glances at each other, smiling with the light of\nlove beneath their radiant brows.  And at last and scarcely then\ndid the maiden greet him:",
        "(ll. 1026-1062)  “Take heed now, that I may devise help for thee.\nWhen at thy coming my father has given thee the deadly teeth from\nthe dragon’s jaws for sowing, then watch for the time when the\nnight is parted in twain, then bathe in the stream of the\ntireless river, and alone, apart from others, clad in dusky\nraiment, dig a rounded pit; and therein slay a ewe, and sacrifice\nit whole, heaping high the pyre on the very edge of the pit.  And\npropitiate only-begotten Hecate, daughter of Perses, pouring from\na goblet the hive-stored labour of bees.  And then, when thou\nhast heedfully sought the grace of the goddess, retreat from the\npyre; and let neither the sound of feet drive thee to turn back,\nnor the baying of hounds, lest haply thou shouldst maim all the\nrites and thyself fail to return duly to thy comrades.  And at\ndawn steep this charm in water, strip, and anoint thy body\ntherewith as with oil; and in it there will be boundless prowess\nand mighty strength, and thou wilt deem thyself a match not for\nmen but for the immortal gods.  And besides, let thy spear and\nshield and sword be sprinkled.  Thereupon the spear-heads of the\nearthborn men shall not pierce thee, nor the flame of the deadly\nbulls as it rushes forth resistless.  But such thou shalt be not\nfor long, but for that one day; still never flinch from the\ncontest.  And I will tell thee besides of yet another help.  As\nsoon as thou hast yoked the strong oxen, and with thy might and\nthy prowess hast ploughed all the stubborn fallow, and now along\nthe furrows the Giants are springing up, when the serpent’s teeth\nare sown on the dusky clods, if thou markest them uprising in\nthrongs from the fallow, cast unseen among them a massy stone;\nand they over it, like ravening hounds over their food, will slay\none another; and do thou thyself hasten to rush to the battle-\nstrife, and the fleece thereupon thou shalt bear far away from\nAea; nevertheless, depart wherever thou wilt, or thy pleasure\ntakes thee, when thou hast gone hence.”",
        "(ll. 1063-1068)  Thus she spake, and cast her eyes to her feet in\nsilence, and her cheek, divinely fair, was wet with warm tears as\nshe sorrowed for that he was about to wander far from her side\nover the wide sea: and once again she addressed him face to face\nwith mournful words, and took his right hand; for now shame had\nleft her eyes:",
        "(ll. 1069-1076)  “Remember, if haply thou returnest to thy home,\nMedea’s name; and so will I remember thine, though thou be far\naway.  And of thy kindness tell me this, where is thy home,\nwhither wilt thou sail hence in thy ship over the sea; wilt thou\ncome near wealthy Orchomenus, or near the Aeaean isle?  And tell\nme of the maiden, whosoever she be that thou hast named, the\nfar-renowned daughter of Pasiphae, who is kinswoman to my\nfather.”",
        "(ll. 1077-1078)  Thus she spake; and over him too, at the tears\nof the maiden, stole Love the destroyer, and he thus answered\nher:",
        "(ll. 1079-1101)  “All too surely do I deem that never by night\nand never by day will I forget thee if I escape death and indeed\nmake my way in safety to the Achaean land, and Aeetes set not\nbefore us some other contest worse than this.  And if it pleases\nthee to know about my fatherland, I will tell it out; for indeed\nmy own heart bids me do that.  There is a land encircled by lofty\nmountains, rich in sheep and in pasture, where Prometheus, son of\nIapetus, begat goodly Deucalion, who first founded cities and\nreared temples to the immortal gods, and first ruled over men.\nThis land the neighbours who dwell around call Haemonia.  And in\nit stands Ioleus, my city, and in it many others, where they have\nnot so much as heard the name of the Aeaean isle; yet there is a\nstory that Minyas starting thence, Minyas son of Aeolus, built\nlong ago the city of Orchomenus that borders on the Cadmeians.\nBut why do I tell thee all this vain talk, of our home and of\nMinos’ daughter, far-famed Ariadne, by which glorious name they\ncalled that lovely maiden of whom thou askest me?  Would that, as\nMinos then was well inclined to Theseus for her sake, so may thy\nfather be joined to us in friendship!”",
        "(ll. 1102-1104)  Thus he spake, soothing her with gentle\nconverse.  But pangs most bitter stirred her heart and in grief\ndid she address him with vehement words:",
        "(ll. 1105-1117)  “In Hellas, I ween, this is fair to pay heed to\ncovenants; but Aeetes is not such a man among men as thou sayest\nwas Pasiphae’s husband, Minos; nor can I liken myself to Ariadne;\nwherefore speak not of guest-love.  But only do thou, when thou\nhast reached Iolcus, remember me, and thee even in my parents’\ndespite, will I remember.  And from far off may a rumour come to\nme or some messenger-bird, when thou forgettest me; or me, even\nme, may swift blasts catch up and bear over the sea hence to\nIolcus, that so I may cast reproaches in thy face and remind thee\nthat it was by my good will thou didst escape.  May I then be\nseated in thy halls, an unexpected guest!”",
        "(ll. 1118-1130)  Thus she spake with piteous tears falling down\nher cheeks, and to her Jason replied: “Let the empty blasts\nwander at will, lady, and the messenger-bird, for vain is thy\ntalk.  But if thou comest to those abodes and to the land of\nHellas, honoured and reverenced shalt thou be by women and men;\nand they shall worship thee even as a goddess, for that by thy\ncounsel their sons came home again, their brothers and kinsmen\nand stalwart husbands were saved from calamity.  And in our\nbridal chamber shalt thou prepare our couch; and nothing shall\ncome between our love till the doom of death fold us round.”",
        "(ll. 1131-1136)  Thus he spake; and her soul melted within her to\nhear his words; nevertheless she shuddered to behold the deeds of\ndestruction to come.  Poor wretch!  Not long was she destined to\nrefuse a home in Hellas.  For thus Hera devised it, that Aeaean\nMedea might come to Ioleus for a bane to Pelias, forsaking her\nnative land.",
        "(ll. 1137-1145)  And now her handmaids, glancing at them from a\ndistance, were grieving in silence; and the time of day required\nthat the maiden should return home to her mother’s side.  But she\nthought not yet of departing, for her soul delighted both in his\nbeauty and in his winsome words, but Aeson’s son took heed, and\nspake at last, though late: “It is time to depart, lest the\nsunlight sink before we know it, and some stranger notice all;\nbut again will we come and meet here.”",
        "(ll. 1146-1162)  So did they two make trial of one another thus\nfar with gentle words; and thereafter parted.  Jason hastened to\nreturn in joyous mood to his comrades and the ship, she to her\nhandmaids; and they all together came near to meet her, but she\nmarked them not at all as they thronged around.  For her soul had\nsoared aloft amid the clouds.  And her feet of their own accord\nmounted the swift chariot, and with one hand she took the reins,\nand with the other the whip of cunning workmanship, to drive the\nmules; and they rushed hasting to the city and the palace.  And\nwhen she was come Chalciope in grief for her sons questioned her;\nbut Medea, distraught by swiftly-changing thoughts, neither heard\nher words nor was eager to speak in answer to her questions.  But\nshe sat upon a low stool at the foot of her couch, bending down,\nher cheek leaning on her left hand, and her eyes were wet with\ntears as she pondered what an evil deed she had taken part in by\nher counsels.",
        "(ll. 1163-1190)  Now when Aeson’s son had joined his comrades\nagain in the spot where he had left them when he departed, he set\nout to go with them, telling them all the story, to the gathering\nof the heroes; and together they approached the ship.  And when\nthey saw Jason they embraced him and questioned him.  And he told\nto all the counsels of the maiden and showed the dread charm; but\nIdas alone of his comrades sat apart biting down his wrath; and\nthe rest joyous in heart, at the hour when the darkness of night\nstayed them, peacefully took thought for themselves.  But at\ndaybreak they sent two men to go to Aeetes and ask for the seed,\nfirst Telamon himself, dear to Ares, and with him Aethalides,\nHermes’ famous son.  So they went and made no vain journey; but\nwhen they came, lordly Aeetes gave them for the contest the fell\nteeth of the Aonian dragon which Cadmus found in Ogygian Thebes\nwhen he came seeking for Europa and there slew the–warder of\nthe spring of Ares.  There he settled by the guidance of the\nheifer whom Apollo by his prophetic word granted him to lead him\non his way.  But the teeth the Tritonian goddess tore away from\nthe dragon’s jaws and bestowed as a gift upon Aeetes and the\nslayer.  And Agenor’s son, Cadmus, sowed them on the Aonian\nplains and founded an earthborn people of all who were left from\nthe spear when Ares did the reaping; and the teeth Aeetes then\nreadily gave to be borne to the ship, for he deemed not that\nJason would bring the contest to an end, even though he should\ncast the yoke upon the oxen.",
        "(ll. 1191-1224)  Far away in the west the sun was sailing beneath\nthe dark earth, beyond the furthest hills of the Aethiopians; and\nNight was laying the yoke upon her steeds; and the heroes were\npreparing their beds by the hawsers.  But Jason, as soon as the\nstars of Heliee, the bright-gleaming bear, had set, and the air\nhad all grown still under heaven, went to a desert spot, like\nsome stealthy thief, with all that was needful; for beforehand in\nthe daytime had he taken thought for everything; and Argus came\nbringing a ewe and milk from the flock; and them he took from the\nship.  But when the hero saw a place which was far away from the\ntread of men, in a clear meadow beneath the open sky, there first\nof all he bathed his tender body reverently in the sacred river;\nand round him he placed a dark robe, which Hypsipyle of Lemnos\nhad given him aforetime, a memorial of many a loving embrace.\nThen he dug a pit in the ground of a cubit’s depth and heaped up\nbillets of wood, and over it he cut the throat of the sheep, and\nduly placed the carcase above; and he kindled the logs placing\nfire beneath, and poured over them mingled libations, calling on\nHecate Brimo to aid him in the contests.  And when he had called\non her he drew back; and she heard him, the dread goddess, from\nthe uttermost depths and came to the sacrifice of Aeson’s son;\nand round her horrible serpents twined themselves among the oak\nboughs; and there was a gleam of countless torches; and sharply\nhowled around her the hounds of hell.  All the meadows trembled\nat her step; and the nymphs that haunt the marsh and the river\nshrieked, all who dance round that mead of Amarantian Phasis. \nAnd fear seized Aeson’s son, but not even so did he turn round as\nhis feet bore him forth, till he came back to his comrades; and\nnow early dawn arose and shed her light above snowy Caucasus.",
        "(ll. 1225-1245)  Then Aeetes arrayed his breast in the stiff\ncorslet which Ares gave him when he had slain Phlegraean Mimas\nwith his own hands; and upon his head he placed a golden helmet\nwith four plumes, gleaming like the sun’s round light when he\nfirst rises from Ocean.  And he wielded his shield of many hides,\nand his spear, terrible, resistless; none of the heroes could\nhave withstood its shock now that they had left behind Heracles\nfar away, who alone could have met it in battle.  For the king\nhis well-fashioned chariot of swift steeds was held near at hand\nby Phaethon, for him to mount; and he mounted, and held the reins\nin his hands.  Then from the city he drove along the broad\nhighway, that he might be present at the contest; and with him a\ncountless multitude rushed forth.  And as Poseidon rides, mounted\nin his chariot, to the Isthmian contest or to Taenarus, or to\nLerna’s water, or through the grove of Hyantian Onchestus, and\nthereafter passes even to Calaureia with his steeds, and the\nHaemonian rock, or well-wooded Geraestus; even so was Aeetes,\nlord of the Colchians, to behold.",
        "(ll. 1246-1277)  Meanwhile, prompted by Medea, Jason steeped the\ncharm in water and sprinkled with it his shield and sturdy spear,\nand sword; and his comrades round him made proof of his weapons\nwith might and main, but could not bend that spear even a little,\nbut it remained firm in their stalwart hands unbroken as before.\nBut in furious rage with them Idas, Aphareus’ son, with his great\nsword hewed at the spear near the butt, and the edge leapt back\nrepelled by the shock, like a hammer from the anvil; and the\nheroes shouted with joy for their hope in the contest.  And then\nhe sprinkled his body, and terrible prowess entered into him,\nunspeakable, dauntless; and his hands on both sides thrilled\nvigorously as they swelled with strength.  And as when a warlike\nsteed eager for the fight neighs and beats the ground with his\nhoof, while rejoicing he lifts his neck on high with ears erect;\nin such wise did Aeson’s son rejoice in the strength of his\nlimbs.  And often hither and thither did he leap high in air\ntossing in his hands his shield of bronze and ashen spear.  Thou\nwouldst say that wintry lightning flashing from the gloomy sky\nkept on darting forth from the clouds what time they bring with\nthem their blackest rainstorm.  Not long after that were the\nheroes to hold back from the contests; but sitting in rows on\ntheir benches they sped swiftly on to the plain of Ares.  And it\nlay in front of them on the opposite side of the city, as far off\nas is the turning-post that a chariot must reach from the\nstarting-point, when the kinsmen of a dead king appoint funeral\ngames for footmen and horsemen.  And they found Aeetes and the\ntribes of the Colchians; these were stationed on the Caucasian\nheights, but the king by the winding brink of the river.",
        "(ll. 1278-1325)  Now Aeson’s son, as soon as his comrades had\nmade the hawsers fast, leapt from the ship, and with spear and\nshield came forth to the contest; and at the same time he took\nthe gleaming helmet of bronze filled with sharp teeth, and his\nsword girt round his shoulders, his body stripped, in somewise\nresembling Ares and in somewise Apollo of the golden sword.  And\ngazing over the field he saw the bulls’ yoke of bronze and near\nit the plough, all of one piece, of stubborn adamant.  Then he\ncame near, and fixed his sturdy spear upright on its butt, and\ntaking his helmet, off leant it against the spear.  And he went\nforward with shield alone to examine the countless tracks of the\nbulls, and they from some unseen lair beneath the earth, where\nwas their strong steading, wrapt in murky smoke, both rushed out\ntogether, breathing forth flaming fire.  And sore afraid were the\nheroes at the sight.  But Jason, setting wide his feet, withstood\ntheir onset, as in the sea a rocky reef withstands the waves\ntossed by the countless blasts.  Then in front of him he held his\nshield; and both the bulls with loud bellowing attacked him with\ntheir mighty horns; nor did they stir him a jot by their onset.\nAnd as when through the holes of the furnace the armourers’\nbellows anon gleam brightly, kindling the ravening flame, and\nanon cease from blowing, and a terrible roar rises from the fire\nwhen it darts up from below; so the bulls roared, breathing forth\nswift flame from their mouths, while the consuming heat played\nround him, smiting like lightning; but the maiden’s charms\nprotected him.  Then grasping the tip of the horn of the right-\nhand bull, he dragged it mightily with all his strength to bring\nit near the yoke of bronze, and forced it down on to its knees,\nsuddenly striking with his foot the foot of bronze.  So also he\nthrew the other bull on to its knees as it rushed upon him, and\nsmote it down with one blow.  And throwing to the ground his\nbroad shield, he held them both down where they had fallen on\ntheir fore-knees, as he strode from side to side, now here, now\nthere, and rushed swiftly through the flame.  But Aeetes\nmarvelled at the hero’s might.  And meantime the sons of\nTyndareus   for long since had it been thus ordained for them –\nnear at hand gave him the yoke from the ground to cast round\nthem.  Then tightly did he bind their necks; and lifting the pole\nof bronze between them, he fastened it to the yoke by its golden\ntip.  So the twin heroes started back from the fire to the ship.\nBut Jason took up again his shield and cast it on his back behind\nhim, and grasped the strong helmet filled with sharp teeth, and\nhis resistless spear, wherewith, like some ploughman with a\nPelasgian goad, he pricked the bulls beneath, striking their\nflanks; and very firmly did he guide the well fitted plough\nhandle, fashioned of adamant.",
        "(ll. 1326-1339)  The bulls meantime raged exceedingly, breathing\nforth furious flame of fire; and their breath rose up like the\nroar of blustering winds, in fear of which above all seafaring\nmen furl their large sail.  But not long after that they moved on\nat the bidding of the spear; and behind them the rugged fallow\nwas broken up, cloven by the might of the bulls and the sturdy\nploughman.  Then terribly groaned the clods withal along the\nfurrows of the plough as they were rent, each a man’s burden; and\nJason followed, pressing down the cornfield with firm foot; and\nfar from him he ever sowed the teeth along the clods as each was\nploughed, turning his head back for fear lest the deadly crop of\nearthborn men should rise against him first; and the bulls toiled\nonwards treading with their hoofs of bronze.",
        "(ll. 1340-1407)  But when the third part of the day was still\nleft as it wanes from dawn, and wearied labourers call for the\nsweet hour of unyoking to come to them straightway, then the\nfallow was ploughed by the tireless ploughman, four plough-gates\nthough it was; and he loosed the plough from the oxen.  Them he\nscared in flight towards the plain; but he went back again to the\nship, while he still saw the furrows free of the earthborn men.\nAnd all round his comrades heartened him with their shouts.  And\nin the helmet he drew from the river’s stream and quenched his\nthirst with the water.  Then he bent his knees till they grew\nsupple, and filled his mighty heart with courage, raging like a\nboar, when it sharpens its teeth against the hunters, while from\nits wrathful mouth plenteous foam drips to the ground.  By now\nthe earthborn men were springing up over all the field; and the\nplot of Ares, the death-dealer, bristled with sturdy shields and\ndouble-pointed spears and shining helmets; and the gleam reached\nOlympus from beneath, flashing through the air.  And as when\nabundant snow has fallen on the earth and the storm blasts have\ndispersed the wintry clouds under the murky night, and all the\nhosts of the stars appear shining through the gloom; so did those\nwarriors shine springing up above the earth.  But Jason bethought\nhim of the counsels of Medea full of craft, and seized from the\nplain a huge round boulder, a terrible quoit of Ares Enyalius;\nfour stalwart youths could not have raised it from the ground\neven a little.  Taking it in his hands he threw it with a rush\nfar away into their midst; and himself crouched unseen behind his\nshield, with full confidence.  And the Colchians gave a loud cry,\nlike the roar of the sea when it beats upon sharp crags; and\nspeechless amazement seized Aeetes at the rush of the sturdy\nquoit.  And the Earthborn, like fleet-footed hounds, leaped upon\none another and slew with loud yells; and on earth their mother\nthey fell beneath their own spears, likes pines or oaks, which\nstorms of wind beat down.  And even as a fiery star leaps from\nheaven, trailing a furrow of light, a portent to men, whoever see\nit darting with a gleam through the dusky sky; in such wise did\nAeson’s son rush upon the earthborn men, and he drew from the\nsheath his bare sword, and smote here and there, mowing them\ndown, many on the belly and side, half risen to the air–and\nsome that had risen as far as the shoulders–and some just\nstanding upright, and others even now rushing to battle.  And as\nwhen a fight is stirred up concerning boundaries, and a\nhusbandman, in fear lest they should ravage his fields, seizes in\nhis hand a curved sickle, newly sharpened, and hastily cuts the\nunripe crop, and waits not for it to be parched in due season by\nthe beams of the sun; so at that time did Jason cut down the crop\nof the Earthborn; and the furrows were filled with blood, as the\nchannels of a spring with water.  And they fell, some on their\nfaces biting the rough clod of earth with their teeth, some on\ntheir backs, and others on their hands and sides, like to sea-\nmonsters to behold.  And many, smitten before raising their feet\nfrom the earth, bowed down as far to the ground as they had risen\nto the air, and rested there with the damp of death on their\nbrows.  Even so, I ween, when Zeus has sent a measureless rain,\nnew planted orchard-shoots droop to the ground, cut off by the\nroot the toil of gardening men; but heaviness of heart and deadly\nanguish come to the owner of the farm, who planted them; so at\nthat time did bitter grief come upon the heart of King Aeetes.\nAnd he went back to the city among the Colchians, pondering how\nhe might most quickly oppose the heroes.  And the day died, and\nJason’s contest was ended.",
        "Endnotes:\n(1)  i.e. the fight between the gods and the giants.\n(2)  i.e. the Shining One.\n(3)  A name of Ares.\n(4)  i.e. the liquid that flows in the veins of gods.\n(5)  Or, reading MENIM, “took no heed of the cause of wrath with\n     the stranger-folk.”",
        "(ll. 1-5)  Now do thou thyself, goddess Muse, daughter of Zeus,\ntell of the labour and wiles of the Colchian maiden.  Surely my\nsoul within me wavers with speechless amazement as I ponder\nwhether I should call it the lovesick grief of mad passion or a\npanic flight, through which she left the Colchian folk.",
        "(ll. 6-10)  Aeetes all night long with the bravest captains of\nhis people was devising in his halls sheer treachery against the\nheroes, with fierce wrath in his heart at the issue of the\nhateful contest; nor did he deem at all that these things were\nbeing accomplished without the knowledge of his daughters.",
        "(ll. 11-29)  But into Medea’s heart Hera cast most grievous fear;\nand she trembled like a nimble fawn whom the baying of hounds\nhath terrified amid the thicket of a deep copse.  For at once she\ntruly forboded that the aid she had given was not hidden from her\nfather, and that quickly she would fill up the cup of woe.  And\nshe dreaded the guilty knowledge of her handmaids; her eyes were\nfilled with fire and her ears rung with a terrible cry.  Often\ndid she clutch at her throat, and often did she drag out her hair\nby the roots and groan in wretched despair.  There on that very\nday the maiden would have tasted the drugs and perished and so\nhave made void the purposes of Hera, had not the goddess driven\nher, all bewildered, to flee with the sons of Phrixus; and her\nfluttering soul within her was comforted; and then she poured\nfrom her bosom all the drugs back again into the casket.  Then\nshe kissed her bed, and the folding-doors on both sides, and\nstroked the walls, and tearing away in her hands a long tress of\nhair, she left it in the chamber for her mother, a memorial of\nher maidenhood, and thus lamented with passionate voice:",
        "(ll. 30-33)  “I go, leaving this long tress here in my stead, O\nmother mine; take this farewell from me as I go far hence;\nfarewell Chalciope, and all my home.  Would that the sea,\nstranger, had dashed thee to pieces, ere thou camest to the\nColchian land!”",
        "(ll. 34-56)  Thus she spake, and from her eyes shed copious\ntears.  And as a bondmaid steals away from a wealthy house, whom\nfate has lately severed from her native land, nor yet has she\nmade trial of grievous toil, but still unschooled to misery and\nshrinking in terror from slavish tasks, goes about beneath the\ncruel hands of a mistress; even so the lovely maiden rushed forth\nfrom her home.  But to her the bolts of the doors gave way\nself-moved, leaping backwards at the swift strains of her magic\nsong.  And with bare feet she sped along the narrow paths, with\nher left hand holding her robe over her brow to veil her face and\nfair cheeks, and with her right lifting up the hem of her tunic.\nQuickly along the dark track, outside the towers of the spacious\ncity, did she come in fear; nor did any of the warders note her,\nbut she sped on unseen by them.  Thence she was minded to go to\nthe temple; for well she knew the way, having often aforetime\nwandered there in quest of corpses and noxious roots of the\nearth, as a sorceress is wont to do; and her soul fluttered with\nquivering fear.  And the Titanian goddess, the moon, rising from\na far land, beheld her as she fled distraught, and fiercely\nexulted over her, and thus spake to her own heart:",
        "(ll. 57-65)  “Not I alone then stray to the Latinian cave, nor do\nI alone burn with love for fair Endymion; oft times with thoughts\nof love have I been driven away by thy crafty spells, in order\nthat in the darkness of night thou mightest work thy sorcery at\nease, even the deeds dear to thee.  And now thou thyself too hast\npart in a like mad passion; and some god of affection has given\nthee Jason to be thy grievous woe.  Well, go on, and steel thy\nheart, wise though thou be, to take up thy burden of pain,\nfraught with many sighs.”",
        "(ll. 66-82)  Thus spake the goddess; but swiftly the maiden’s\nfeet bore her, hasting on.  And gladly did she gain the high-bank\nof the river and beheld on the opposite side the gleam of fire,\nwhich all night long the heroes were kindling in joy at the\ncontest’s issue.  Then through the gloom, with clear-pealing\nvoice from across the stream, she called on Phrontis, the\nyoungest of Phrixus’ sons, and he with his brothers and Aeson’s\nson recognised the maiden’s voice; and in silence his comrades\nwondered when they knew that it was so in truth.  Thrice she\ncalled, and thrice at the bidding of the company Phrontis called\nout in reply; and meantime the heroes were rowing with swift-\nmoving oars in search of her.  Not yet were they casting the\nship’s hawsers upon the opposite bank, when Jason with light feet\nleapt to land from the deck above, and after him Phrontis and\nArgus, sons of Phrixus, leapt to the ground; and she, clasping\ntheir knees with both hands, thus addressed them:",
        "(ll. 83-91)  “Save me, the hapless one, my friends, from Aeetes,\nand yourselves too, for all is brought to light, nor doth any\nremedy come.  But let us flee upon the ship, before the king\nmounts his swift chariot.  And I will lull to sleep the guardian\nserpent and give you the fleece of gold; but do thou, stranger,\namid thy comrades make the gods witness of the vows thou hast\ntaken on thyself for my sake; and now that I have fled far from\nmy country, make me not a mark for blame and dishonour for want\nof kinsmen.”",
        "(ll. 92-98)  She spake in anguish; but greatly did the heart of\nAeson’s son rejoice, and at once, as she fell at his knees, he\nraised her gently and embraced her, and spake words of comfort:\n\"Lady, let Zeus of Olympus himself be witness to my oath, and\nHera, queen of marriage, bride of Zeus, that I will set thee in\nmy halls my own wedded wife, when we have reached the land of\nHellas on our return.”",
        "(ll. 99-108)  Thus he spake, and straightway clasped her right\nhand in his; and she bade them row the swift ship to the sacred\ngrove near at hand, in order that, while it was still night, they\nmight seize and carry off the fleece against the will of Aeetes.\nWord and deed were one to the eager crew.  For they took her on\nboard, and straightway thrust the ship from shore; and loud was\nthe din as the chieftains strained at their oars, but she,\nstarting back, held out her hands in despair towards the shore.\nBut Jason spoke cheering words and restrained her grief.",
        "(ll. 109-122)  Now at the hour when men have cast sleep from\ntheir eyes~huntsmen, who, trusting to their bounds, never slumber\naway the end of night, but avoid the light of dawn lest, smiting\nwith its white beams, it efface the track and scent of the quarry\n– then did Aeson’s son and the maiden step forth from the ship\nover a grassy spot, the “Ram’s couch” as men call it, where it\nfirst bent its wearied knees in rest, bearing on its back the\nMinyan son of Athamas.  And close by, all smirched with soot, was\nthe base of the altar, which the Aeolid Phrixus once set up to\nZeus, the alder of fugitives, when he sacrificed the golden\nwonder at the bidding of Hermes who graciously met him on the\nway.  There by the counsels of Argus the chieftains put them\nashore.",
        "(ll. 123-161)  And they two by the pathway came to the sacred\ngrove, seeking the huge oak tree on which was hung the fleece,\nlike to a cloud that blushes red with the fiery beams of the\nrising sun.  But right in front the serpent with his keen\nsleepless eyes saw them coming, and stretched out his long neck\nand hissed in awful wise; and all round the long banks of the\nriver echoed and the boundless grove.  Those heard it who dwelt\nin the Colchian land very far from Titanian Aea, near the outfall\nof Lycus, the river which parts from loud-roaring Araxes and\nblends his sacred stream with Phasis, and they twain flow on\ntogether in one and pour their waters into the Caucasian Sea.\nAnd through fear young mothers awoke, and round their new-born\nbabes, who were sleeping in their arms, threw their hands in\nagony, for the small limbs started at that hiss.  And as when\nabove a pile of smouldering wood countless eddies of smoke roll\nup mingled with soot, and one ever springs up quickly after\nanother, rising aloft from beneath in wavering wreaths; so at\nthat time did that monster roll his countless coils covered with\nhard dry scales.  And as he writhed, the maiden came before his\neyes, with sweet voice calling to her aid sleep, highest of gods,\nto charm the monster; and she cried to the queen of the\nunderworld, the night-wanderer, to be propitious to her\nenterprise.  And Aeson’s son followed in fear, but the serpent,\nalready charmed by her song, was relaxing the long ridge of his\ngiant spine, and lengthening out his myriad coils, like a dark\nwave, dumb and noiseless, rolling over a sluggish sea; but still\nhe raised aloft his grisly head, eager to enclose them both in\nhis murderous jaws.  But she with a newly cut spray of juniper,\ndipping and drawing untempered charms from her mystic brew,\nsprinkled his eyes, while she chanted her song; and all around\nthe potent scent of the charm cast sleep; and on the very spot he\nlet his jaw sink down; and far behind through the wood with its\nmany trees were those countless coils stretched out.",
        "Hereupon Jason snatched the golden fleece from the oak, at the\nmaiden bidding; and she, standing firm, smeared with the charm\nthe monster’s head, till Jason himself bade her turn back towards\ntheir ship, and she left the grove of Ares, dusky with shade.\nAnd as a maiden catches on her finely wrought robe the gleam of\nthe moon at the full, as it rises above her high-roofed chamber;\nand her heart rejoices as she beholds the fair ray; so at that\ntime did Jason uplift the mighty fleece in his hands; and from\nthe shimmering of the flocks of wool there settled on his fair\ncheeks and brow a red flush like a flame.  And great as is the\nhide of a yearling ox or stag, which huntsmen call a brocket, so\ngreat in extent was the fleece all golden above.  Heavy it was,\nthickly clustered with flocks; and as he moved along, even\nbeneath his feet the sheen rose up from the earth.  And he strode\non now with the fleece covering his left shoulder from the height\nof his neck to his feet, and now again he gathered it up in his\nhands; for he feared exceedingly, lest some god or man should\nmeet him and deprive him thereof.",
        "(ll. 183-189)  Dawn was spreading over the earth when they\nreached the throng of heroes; and the youths marvelled to behold\nthe mighty fleece, which gleamed like the lightning of Zeus.  And\neach one started up eager to touch it and clasp it in his hands.\nBut the son of Aeson restrained them all, and threw over it a\nmantle newly-woven; and he led the maiden to the stern and seated\nher there, and spake to them all as follows:",
        "(ll. 190-205)  “No longer now, my friends, forbear to return to\nyour fatherland.  For now the task for which we dared this\ngrievous voyage, toiling with bitter sorrow of heart, has been\nlightly fulfilled by the maiden’s counsels.  Her–for such is\nher will–I will bring home to be my wedded wife; do ye\npreserve her, the glorious saviour of all Achaea and of\nyourselves.  For of a surety, I ween, will Aeetes come with his\nhost to bar our passage from the river into the sea.  But do some\nof you toil at the oars in turn, sitting man by man; and half of\nyou raise your shields of oxhide, a ready defence against the\ndarts of the enemy, and guard our return.  And now in our hands\nwe hold the fate of our children and dear country and of our aged\nparents; and on our venture all Hellas depends, to reap either\nthe shame of failure or great renown.”",
        "(ll. 206-211)  Thus he spake, and donned his armour of war; and\nthey cried aloud, wondrously eager.  And he drew his sword from\nthe sheath and cut the hawsers at the stern.  And near the maiden\nhe took his stand ready armed by the steersman Aneaeus, and with\ntheir rowing the ship sped on as they strained desperately to\ndrive her clear of the river.",
        "(ll. 212-235)  By this time Medea’s love and deeds had become\nknown to haughty Aeetes and to all the Colchians.  And they\nthronged to the assembly in arms; and countless as the waves of\nthe stormy sea when they rise crested by the wind, or as the\nleaves that fall to the ground from the wood with its myriad\nbranches in the month when the leaves fall–who could reckon\ntheir tale?–so they in countless number poured along the banks\nof the river shouting in frenzy; and in his shapely chariot\nAeetes shone forth above all with his steeds, the gift of Helios,\nswift as the blasts of the wind.  In his left hand he raised his\ncurved shield, and in his right a huge pine-torch, and near him\nin front stood up his mighty spear.  And Apsyrtus held in his\nhands the reins of the steeds.  But already the ship was cleaving\nthe sea before her, urged on by stalwart oarsmen, and the stream\nof the mighty river rushing down.  But the king in grievous\nanguish lifted his hands and called on Helios and Zeus to bear\nwitness to their evil deeds; and terrible threats he uttered\nagainst all his people, that unless they should with their own\nhands seize the maiden, either on the land or still finding the\nship on the swell of the open sea, and bring her back, that so he\nmight satisfy his eager soul with vengeance for all those deeds,\nat the cost of their own lives they should learn and abide all\nhis rage and revenge.",
        "(ll. 236-240)  Thus spake Aeetes; and on that same day the\nColchians launched their ships and cast the tackle on board, and\non that same day sailed forth on the sea; thou wouldst not say so\nmighty a host was a fleet of ships, but that a countless flight\nof birds, swarm on swarm, was clamouring over the sea.",
        "(ll. 241-252)  Swiftly the wind blew, as the goddess Hera\nplanned, so that most quickly Aeaean Medea might reach the\nPelasgian land, a bane to the house of Pelias, and on the third\nmorn they bound the ship’s stern cables to the shores of the\nPaphlagonians, at the mouth of the river Halys.  For Medea bade\nthem land and propitiate Hecate with sacrifice.  Now all that the\nmaiden prepared for offering the sacrifice may no man know, and\nmay my soul not urge me to sing thereof.  Awe restrains my lips,\nyet from that time the altar which the heroes raised on the beach\nto the goddess remains till now, a sight to men of a later day.",
        "(ll. 253-256)  And straightway Aeson’s son and the rest of the\nheroes bethought them of Phineus, how that he had said that their\ncourse from Aea should be different, but to all alike his meaning\nwas dim.  Then Argus spake, and they eagerly hearkened:",
        "(ll. 257-293)  “We go to Orchomenus, whither that unerring seer,\nwhom ye met aforetime, foretold your voyage.  For there is\nanother course, signified by those priests of the immortal gods,\nwho have sprung from Tritonian Thebes.  As yet all the stars that\nwheel in the heaven were not, nor yet, though one should inquire,\ncould aught be heard of the sacred race of the Danai.  Apidanean\nArcadians alone existed, Arcadians who lived even before the\nmoon, it is said, eating acorns on the hills; nor at that time\nwas the Pelasgian land ruled by the glorious sons of Deucalion,\nin the days when Egypt, mother of men of an older time, was\ncalled the fertile Morning-land, and the river fair-flowing\nTriton, by which all the Morning-land is watered; and never does\nthe rain from Zeus moisten the earth; but from the flooding of\nthe river abundant crops spring up.  From this land, it is said,\na king (1) made his way all round through the whole of Europe and\nAsia, trusting in the might and strength and courage of his\npeople; and countless cities did he found wherever he came,\nwhereof some are still inhabited and some not; many an age hath\npassed since then.  But Aea abides unshaken even now and the sons\nof those men whom that king settled to dwell in Aea.  They\npreserve the writings of their fathers, graven on pillars,\nwhereon are marked all the ways and the limits of sea and land as\nye journey on all sides round.  There is a river, the uttermost\nhorn of Ocean, broad and exceeding deep, that a merchant ship may\ntraverse; they call it Ister and have marked it far off; and for\na while it cleaves the boundless tilth alone in one stream; for\nbeyond the blasts of the north wind, far off in the Rhipaean\nmountains, its springs burst forth with a roar.  But when it\nenters the boundaries of the Thracians and Scythians, here,\ndividing its stream into two, it sends its waters partly into the\nIonian sea, (2) and partly to the south into a deep gulf that\nbends upwards from the Trinaerian sea, that sea which lies along\nyour land, if indeed Achelous flows forth from your land.”",
        "(ll. 204-302)  Thus he spake, and to them the goddess granted a\nhappy portent, and all at the sight shouted approval, that this\nwas their appointed path.  For before them appeared a trail of\nheavenly light, a sign where they might pass.  And gladly they\nleft behind there the son of Lyeus and with canvas outspread\nsailed over the sea, with their eyes on the Paphlagonian\nmountains.  But they did not round Carambis, for the winds and\nthe gleam of the heavenly fire stayed with them till they reached\nIster’s mighty stream.",
        "(ll. 303-337)  Now some of the Colchians, in a vain search,\npassed out from Pontus through the Cyanean rocks; but the rest\nwent to the river, and them Apsyrtus led, and, turning aside, he\nentered the mouth called Fair.  Wherefore he outstripped the\nheroes by crossing a neck of land into the furthest gulf of the\nIonian sea.  For a certain island is enclosed by Ister, by name\nPeuee, three-cornered, its base stretching along the coast, and\nwith a sharp angle towards the river; and round it the outfall is\ncleft in two.  One mouth they call the mouth of Narex, and the\nother, at the lower end, the Fair mouth.  And through this\nApsyrtus and his Colchians rushed with all speed; but the heroes\nwent upwards far away towards the highest part of the island. \nAnd in the meadows the country shepherds left their countless\nflocks for dread of the ships, for they deemed that they were\nbeasts coming forth from the monster-teeming sea.  For never yet\nbefore had they seen seafaring ships, neither the Scythians\nmingled with the Thracians, nor the Sigynni, nor yet the\nGraucenii, nor the Sindi that now inhabit the vast desert plain\nof Laurium.  But when they had passed near the mount Angurum, and\nthe cliff of Cauliacus, far from the mount Angurum, round which\nIster, dividing his stream, falls into the sea on this side and\non that, and the Laurian plain, then indeed the Colchians went\nforth into the Cronian sea and cut off all the ways, to prevent\ntheir foes’ escape.  And the heroes came down the river behind\nand reached the two Brygean isles of Artemis near at hand.  Now\nin one of them was a sacred temple; and on the other they landed,\navoiding the host of Apsyrtus; for the Colchians had left these\nislands out of many within the river, just as they were, through\nreverence for the daughter of Zeus; but the rest, thronged by the\nColchians, barred the ways to the sea.  And so on other islands\ntoo, close by, Apsyrtus left his host as far as the river\nSalangon and the Nestian land.",
        "(ll. 338-349)  There the Minyae would at that time have yielded\nin grim fight, a few to many; but ere then they made a covenant,\nshunning a dire quarrel; as to the golden fleece, that since\nAeetes himself had so promised them if they should fulfill the\ncontests, they should keep it as justly won, whether they carried\nit off by craft or even openly in the king’s despite; but as to\nMedea–for that was the cause of strife–that they should\ngive her in ward to Leto’s daughter apart from the throng, until\nsome one of the kings that dispense justice should utter his\ndoom, whether she must return to her father’s home or follow the\nchieftains to the land of Hellas.",
        "(ll. 350-354)  Now when the maiden had mused upon all this, sharp\nanguish shook her heart unceasingly; and quickly she called forth\nJason alone apart from his comrades, and led him aside until they\nwere far away, and before his face uttered her speech all broken\nwith sobs:",
        "(ll. 355-390)  “What is this purpose that ye are now devising\nabout me, O son of Aeson?  Has thy triumph utterly cast\nforgetfulness upon thee, and reekest thou nothing of all that\nthou spakest when held fast by necessity?  Whither are fled the\noaths by Zeus the suppliants’ god, whither are fled thy honied\npromises?  For which in no seemly wise, with shameless will, I\nhave left my country, the glories of my home and even my parents\n– things that were dearest to me; and far away all alone I am\nborne over the sea with the plaintive kingfishers because of thy\ntrouble, in order that I might save thy life in fulfilling the\ncontests with the oxen and the earthborn men.  Last of all the\nfleece–when the matter became known, it was by my folly thou\ndidst win it; and a foul reproach have I poured on womankind.\nWherefore I say that as thy child, thy bride and thy sister, I\nfollow thee to the land of Hellas.  Be ready to stand by me to\nthe end, abandon me not left forlorn of thee when thou dost visit\nthe kings.  But only save me; let justice and right, to which we\nhave both agreed, stand firm; or else do thou at once shear\nthrough this neck with the sword, that I may gain the guerdon due\nto my mad passion.  Poor wretch!  if the king, to whom you both\ncommit your cruel covenant, doom me to belong to my brother.  How\nshall I come to my father’s sight?  Will it be with a good name?\nWhat revenge, what heavy calamity shall I not endure in agony for\nthe terrible deeds I have done?  And wilt thou win the return\nthat thy heart desires?  Never may Zeus’ bride, the queen of all,\nin whom thou dost glory, bring that to pass.  Mayst thou some\ntime remember me when thou art racked with anguish; may the\nfleece like a dream vanish into the nether darkness on the wings\nof the wind!  And may my avenging Furies forthwith drive thee\nfrom thy country, for all that I have suffered through thy\ncruelty!  These curses will not be allowed to fall unaccomplished\nto the ground.  A mighty oath hast thou transgressed, ruthless\none; but not long shalt thou and thy comrades sit at ease casting\neyes of mockery upon me, for all your covenants.”",
        "(ll. 391-394)  Thus she spake, seething with fierce wrath; and\nshe longed to set fire to the ship and to hew it utterly in\npieces, and herself to fall into the raging flame.  But Jason,\nhalf afraid, thus addressed her with gentle words:",
        "(ll. 395-409)  “Forbear, lady; me too this pleases not.  But we\nseek some respite from battle, for such a cloud of hostile men,\nlike to a fire, surrounds us, on thy account.  For all that\ninhabit this land are eager to aid Apsyrtus, that they may lead\nthee back home to thy father, like some captured maid.  And all\nof us would perish in hateful destruction, if we closed with them\nin fight; and bitterer still will be the pain, if we are slain\nand leave thee to be their prey.  But this covenant will weave a\nweb of guile to lead him to ruin.  Nor will the people of the\nland for thy sake oppose us, to favour the Colchians, when their\nprince is no longer with them, who is thy champion and thy\nbrother; nor will I shrink from matching myself in fight with the\nColchians, if they bar my way homeward.”",
        "(ll. 410-420)  Thus he spake soothing her; and she uttered a\ndeadly speech: “Take heed now.  For when sorry deeds are done we\nmust needs devise sorry counsel, since at first I was distraught\nby my error, and by heaven’s will it was I wrought the\naccomplishment of evil desires.  Do thou in the turmoil shield me\nfrom the Colchians’ spears; and I will beguile Apsyrtus to come\ninto thy hands–do thou greet him with splendid gifts–if\nonly I could persuade the heralds on their departure to bring him\nalone to hearken to my words.  Thereupon if this deed pleases\nthee, slay him and raise a conflict with the Colchians, I care\nnot.",
        "(ll. 421-422)  So they two agreed and prepared a great web of\nguile for Apsyrtus, and provided many gifts such as are due to\nguests, and among them gave a sacred robe of Hypsipyle, of\ncrimson hue.  The Graces with their own hands had wrought it for\nDionysus in sea-girt Dia, and he gave it to his son Thoas\nthereafter, and Thoas left it to Hypsipyle, and she gave that\nfair-wrought guest-gift with many another marvel to Aeson’s son\nto wear.  Never couldst thou satisfy thy sweet desire by touching\nit or gazing on it.  And from it a divine fragrance breathed from\nthe time when the king of Nysa himself lay to rest thereon,\nflushed with wine and nectar as he clasped the beauteous breast\nof the maiden-daughter of Minos, whom once Theseus forsook in the\nisland of Dia, when she had followed him from Cnossus.  And when\nshe had worked upon the heralds to induce her brother to come, as\nsoon as she reached the temple of the goddess, according to the\nagreement, and the darkness of night surrounded them, that so she\nmight devise with him a cunning plan for her to take the mighty\nfleece of gold and return to the home of Aeetes, for, she said,\nthe sons of Phrixus had given her by force to the strangers to\ncarry off; with such beguiling words she scattered to the air and\nthe breezes her witching charms, which even from afar would have\ndrawn down the savage beast from the steep mountain-height.",
        "(ll. 445-451)  Ruthless Love, great bane, great curse to mankind,\nfrom thee come deadly strifes and lamentations and groans, and\ncountless pains as well have their stormy birth from thee. \nArise, thou god, and arm thyself against the sons of our foes in\nsuch guise as when thou didst fill Medea’s heart with accursed\nmadness.  How then by evil doom did she slay Apsyrtus when he\ncame to meet her?  For that must our song tell next.",
        "(ll. 452-481)  When the heroes had left the maiden on the island\nof Artemis, according to the covenant, both sides ran their ships\nto land separately.  And Jason went to the ambush to lie in wait\nfor Apsyrtus and then for his comrades.  But he, beguiled by\nthese dire promises, swiftly crossed the swell of the sea in his\nship, and in dark night set foot on the sacred island; and faring\nall alone to meet her he made trial in speech of his sister, as a\ntender child tries a wintry torrent which not even strong men can\npass through, to see if she would devise some guile against the\nstrangers.  And so they two agreed together on everything; and\nstraightway Aeson’s son leapt forth from the thick ambush,\nlifting his bare sword in his hand; and quickly the maiden turned\nher eyes aside and covered them with her veil that she might not\nsee the blood of her brother when he was smitten.  And Jason\nmarked him and struck him down, as a butcher strikes down a\nmighty strong-horned bull, hard by the temple which the Brygi on\nthe mainland opposite had once built for Artemis.  In its\nvestibule he fell on his knees; and at last the hero breathing\nout his life caught up in both hands the dark blood as it welled\nfrom the wound; and he dyed with red his sister’s silvery veil\nand robe as she shrank away.  And with swift side-glance the\nirresistible pitiless Fury beheld the deadly deed they had done.\nAnd the hero, Aeson’s son, cut off the extremities of the dead\nman, and thrice licked up some blood and thrice spat the\npollution from his teeth, as it is right for the slayer to do, to\natone for a treacherous murder.  And the clammy corpse he hid in\nthe ground where even now those bones lie among the Apsyrtians.",
        "(ll. 481-494)  Now as soon as the heroes saw the blaze of a\ntorch, which the maiden raised for them as a sign to pursue, they\nlaid their own ship near the Colchian ship, and they slaughtered\nthe Colchian host, as kites slay the tribes of wood-pigeons, or\nas lions of the wold, when they have leapt amid the steading,\ndrive a great flock of sheep huddled together.  Nor did one of\nthem escape death, but the heroes rushed upon the whole crew,\ndestroying them like a flame; and at last Jason met them, and was\neager to give aid where none was needed; but already they were\ntaking thought for him too.  Thereupon they sat to devise some)\nprudent counsel for their voyage, and the maiden came upon them\nas they pondered, but Peleus spake his word first:",
        "(ll. 495-502)  “I now bid you embark while it is still night, and\ntake with your oars the passage opposite to that which the enemy\nguards, for at dawn when they see their plight I deem that no\nword urging to further pursuit of us will prevail with them; but\nas people bereft of their king, they will be scattered in\ngrievous dissension.  And easy, when the people are scattered,\nwill this path be for us on our return.”",
        "(ll. 503-506)  Thus he spake; and the youths assented to the\nwords of Aeacus’ son.  And quickly they entered the ship, and\ntoiled at their oars unceasingly until they reached the sacred\nisle of Electra, the highest of them all, near the river\nEridanus.",
        "(ll. 507-521)  But when the Colchians learnt the death of their\nprince, verily they were eager to pursue Argo and the Minyans\nthrough all the Cronian sea.  But Hera restrained them by\nterrible lightnings from the sky.  And at last they loathed their\nown homes in the Cytaean land, quailing before Aeetes’ fierce\nwrath; so they landed and made abiding homes there, scattered far\nand wide.  Some set foot on those very islands where the heroes\nhad stayed, and they still dwell there, bearing a name derived\nfrom Apsyrtus; and others built a fenced city by the dark deep\nIllyrian river, where is the tomb of Harmonia and Cadmus,\ndwelling among the Encheleans; and others live amid the mountains\nwhich are called the Thunderers, from the day when the thunders\nof Zeus, son of Cronos, prevented them from crossing over to the\nisland opposite.",
        "(ll. 522-551)  Now the heroes, when their return seemed safe for\nthem, fared onward and made their hawsers fast to the land of the\nHylleans.  For the islands lay thick in the river and made the\npath dangerous for those who sailed thereby.  Nor, as aforetime,\ndid the Hylleans devise their hurt, but of their own accord\nfurthered their passage, winning as guerdon a mighty tripod of\nApollo.  For tripods twain had Phoebus given to Aeson’s son to\ncarry afar in the voyage he had to make, at the time when he went\nto sacred Pytho to enquire about this very voyage; and it was\nordained by fate that in whatever land they should be placed,\nthat land should never be ravaged by the attacks of foemen.\nTherefore even now this tripod is hidden in that land near the\npleasant city of Hyllus, far beneath the earth, that it may ever\nbe unseen by mortals.  Yet they found not King Hyllus still alive\nin the land, whom fair Melite bare to Heracles in the land of the\nPhaeacians.  For he came to the abode of Nausithous and to\nMacris, the nurse of Dionysus, to cleanse himself from the deadly\nmurder of his children; here he loved and overcame the water\nnymph Melite, the daughter of the river Aegaeus, and she bare\nmighty Hyllus.  But when he had grown up he desired not to dwell\nin that island under the rule of Nausithous the king; but he\ncollected a host of native Phaeacians and came to the Cronian\nsea; for the hero King Nausithous aided his journey, and there he\nsettled, and the Mentores slew him as he was fighting for the\noxen of his field.",
        "(ll. 552-556)  Now, goddesses, say how it is that beyond this\nsea, near the land of Ausonia and the Ligystian isles, which are\ncalled Stoechades, the mighty tracks of the ship Argo are clearly\nsung of?  What great constraint and need brought the heroes so\nfar?  What breezes wafted them?",
        "(ll. 557-591)  When Apsyrtus had fallen in mighty overthrow Zeus\nhimself, king of gods, was seized with wrath at what they had\ndone.  And he ordained that by the counsels of Aeaean Circe they\nshould cleanse themselves from the terrible stain of blood and\nsuffer countless woes before their return.  Yet none of the\nchieftains knew this; but far onward they sped starting from the\nHyllean land, and they left behind all the islands that were\nbeforetime thronged by the Colchians–the Liburnian isles, isle\nafter isle, Issa, Dysceladus, and lovely Pityeia.  Next after\nthem they came to Corcyra, where Poseidon settled the daughter of\nAsopus, fair-haired Corcyra, far from the land of Phlius, whence\nhe had carried her off through love; and sailors beholding it\nfrom the sea, all black with its sombre woods, call it Corcyra\nthe Black.  And next they passed Melite, rejoicing in the\nsoft-blowing breeze, and steep Cerossus, and Nymphaea at a\ndistance, where lady Calypso, daughter of Atlas, dwelt; and they\ndeemed they saw the misty mountains of Thunder.  And then Hera\nbethought her of the counsels and wrath of Zeus concerning them.\nAnd she devised an ending of their voyage and stirred up\nstorm-winds before them, by which they were caught and borne back\nto the rocky isle of Electra.  And straightway on a sudden there\ncalled to them in the midst of their course, speaking with a\nhuman voice, the beam of the hollow ship, which Athena had set in\nthe centre of the stem, made of Dodonian oak.  And deadly fear\nseized them as they heard the voice that told of the grievous\nwrath of Zeus.  For it proclaimed that they should not escape the\npaths of an endless sea nor grievous tempests, unless Circe\nshould purge away the guilt of the ruthless murder of Apsyrtus;\nand it bade Polydeuces and Castor pray to the immortal gods first\nto grant a path through the Ausonian sea where they should find\nCirce, daughter of Perse and Helios.",
        "(ll. 592-626)  Thus Argo cried through the darkness; and the sons\nof Tyndareus uprose, and lifted their hands to the immortals\npraying for each boon: but dejection held the rest of the Minyan\nheroes.  And far on sped Argo under sail, and entered deep into\nthe stream of Eridanus; where once, smitten on the breast by the\nblazing bolt, Phaethon half-consumed fell from the chariot of\nHelios into the opening of that deep lake; and even now it\nbelcheth up heavy steam clouds from the smouldering wound.  And\nno bird spreading its light wings can cross that water; but in\nmid-course it plunges into the flame, fluttering.  And all around\nthe maidens, the daughters of Helios, enclosed in tall poplars,\nwretchedly wail a piteous plaint; and from their eyes they shed\non the ground bright drops of amber.  These are dried by the sun\nupon the sand; but whenever the waters of the dark lake flow over\nthe strand before the blast of the wailing wind, then they roll\non in a mass into Eridanus with swelling tide.  But the Celts\nhave attached this story to them, that these are the tears of\nLeto’s son, Apollo, that are borne along by the eddies, the\ncountless tears that he shed aforetime when he came to the sacred\nrace of the Hyperboreans and left shining heaven at the chiding\nof his father, being in wrath concerning his son whom divine\nCoronis bare in bright Lacereia at the mouth of Amyrus.  And such\nis the story told among these men.  But no desire for food or\ndrink seized the heroes nor were their thoughts turned to joy.\nBut they were sorely afflicted all day, heavy and faint at heart,\nwith the noisome stench, hard to endure, which the streams of\nEridanus sent forth from Phaethon still burning; and at night\nthey heard the piercing lament of the daughters of Helios,\nwailing with shrill voice; and, as they lamented, their tears\nwere borne on the water like drops of oil.",
        "(ll. 627-658)  Thence they entered the deep stream of Rhodanus\nwhich flows into Eridanus; and where they meet there is a roar of\nmingling waters.  Now that river, rising from the ends of the\nearth, where are the portals and mansions of Night, on one side\nbursts forth upon the beach of Ocean, at another pours into the\nIonian sea, and on the third through seven mouths sends its\nstream to the Sardinian sea and its limitless bay. (3)  And from\nRhodanus they entered stormy lakes, which spread throughout the\nCeltic mainland of wondrous size; and there they would have met\nwith an inglorious calamity; for a certain branch of the river\nwas bearing them towards a gulf of Ocean which in ignorance they\nwere about to enter, and never would they have returned from\nthere in safety.  But Hera leaping forth from heaven pealed her\ncry from the Hercynian rock; and all together were shaken with\nfear of her cry; for terribly crashed the mighty firmament.  And\nbackward they turned by reason of the goddess, and noted the path\nby which their return was ordained.  And after a long while they\ncame to the beach of the surging sea by the devising of Hera,\npassing unharmed through countless tribes of the Celts and\nLigyans.  For round them the goddess poured a dread mist day by\nday as they fared on.  And so, sailing through the midmost mouth,\nthey reached the Stoechades islands in safety by the aid of the\nsons of Zeus; wherefore altars and sacred rites are established\nin their honour for ever; and not that sea-faring alone did they\nattend to succour; but Zeus granted to them the ships of future\nsailors too.  Then leaving the Stoechades they passed on to the\nisland Aethalia, where after their toil they wiped away with\npebbles sweat in abundance; and pebbles like skin in colour are\nstrewn on the beach; (4) and there are their quoits and their\nwondrous armour; and there is the Argoan harbour called after\nthem.",
        "(ll. 659-684)  And quickly from there they passed through the\nsea, beholding the Tyrrhenian shores of Ausonia; and they came to\nthe famous harbour of Aeaea, and from the ship they cast hawsers\nto the shore near at hand.  And here they found Circe bathing her\nhead in the salt sea-spray, for sorely had she been scared by\nvisions of the night.  With blood her chambers and all the walls\nof her palace seemed to be running, and flame was devouring all\nthe magic herbs with which she used to bewitch strangers whoever\ncame; and she herself with murderous blood quenched the glowing\nflame, drawing it up in her hands; and she ceased from deadly\nfear.  Wherefore when morning came she rose, and with sea-spray\nwas bathing her hair and her garments.  And beasts, not\nresembling the beasts of the wild, nor yet like men in body, but\nwith a medley of limbs, went in a throng, as sheep from the fold\nin multitudes follow the shepherd.  Such creatures, compacted of\nvarious limbs, did each herself produce from the primeval slime\nwhen she had not yet grown solid beneath a rainless sky nor yet\nhad received a drop of moisture from the rays of the scorching\nsun; but time combined these forms and marshalled them in their\nranks; in such wise these monsters shapeless of form followed\nher.  And exceeding wonder seized the heroes, and at once, as\neach gazed on the form and face of Circe, they readily guessed\nthat she was the sister of Aeetes.",
        "(ll. 685-717)  Now when she had dismissed the fears of her\nnightly visions, straightway she fared backwards, and in her\nsubtlety she bade the heroes follow, charming them on with her\nhand.  Thereupon the host remained stedfast at the bidding of\nAeson’s son, but Jason drew with him the Colchian maid.  And both\nfollowed the selfsame path till they reached the hall of Circe,\nand she in amaze at their coming bade them sit on brightly\nburnished seats.  And they, quiet and silent, sped to the hearth\nand sat there, as is the wont of wretched suppliants.  Medea hid\nher face in both her hands, but Jason fixed in the ground the\nmighty hilted sword with which he had slain Aeetes’ son; nor did\nthey raise their eyes to meet her look.  And straightway Circe\nbecame aware of the doom of a suppliant and the guilt of murder.\nWherefore in reverence for the ordinance of Zeus, the god of\nsuppliants, who is a god of wrath yet mightily aids slayers of\nmen, she began to offer the sacrifice with which ruthless\nsuppliants are cleansed from guilt when they approach the altar.\nFirst, to atone for the murder still unexpiated, she held above\ntheir heads the young of a sow whose dugs yet swelled from the\nfruit of the womb, and, severing its neck, sprinkled their hands\nwith the blood; and again she made propitiation with other drink\nofferings, calling on Zeus the Cleanser, the protector of murder-\nstained suppliants.  And all the defilements in a mass her\nattendants bore forth from the palace–the Naiad nymphs who\nministered all things to her.  And within, Circe, standing by the\nhearth, kept burning atonement-cakes without wine, praying the\nwhile that she might stay from their wrath the terrible Furies,\nand that Zeus himself might be propitious and gentle to them \nboth, whether with hands stained by the blood of a stranger or,\nas kinsfolk, by the blood of a kinsman, they should implore his\ngrace.",
        "(ll. 718-738)  But when she had wrought all her task, then she\nraised them up and seated them on well polished seats, and\nherself sat near, face to face with them.  And at once she asked\nthem clearly of their business and their voyaging, and whence\nthey had come to her land and palace, and had thus seated\nthemselves as suppliants at her hearth.  For in truth the hideous\nremembrance of her dreams entered her mind as she pondered; and\nshe longed to hear the voice of the maiden, her kinswoman, as\nsoon as she saw that she had raised her eyes from the ground. \nFor all those of the race of Helios were plain to discern, since\nby the far flashing of their eyes they shot in front of them a\ngleam as of gold.  So Medea told her all she asked–the\ndaughter of Aeetes of the gloomy heart, speaking gently in the\nColchian tongue, both of the quest and the journeyings of the\nheroes, and of their toils in the swift contests, and how she had\nsinned through the counsels of her much-sorrowing sister, and how\nwith the sons of Phrixus she had fled afar from the tyrannous\nhorrors of her father; but she shrank from telling of the murder\nof Apsyrtus.  Yet she escaped not Circe’s ken; nevertheless, in\nspite of all, she pitied the weeping maiden, and spake thus:",
        "(ll. 739-748)  “Poor wretch, an evil and shameful return hast\nthou planned.  Not for long, I ween, wilt thou escape the heavy\nwrath of Aeetes; but soon will he go even to the dwellings of\nHellas to avenge the blood of his son, for intolerable are the\ndeeds thou hast done.  But since thou art my suppliant and my\nkinswoman, no further ill shall I devise against thee at thy\ncoming; but begone from my halls, companioning the stranger,\nwhosoever he be, this unknown one that thou hast taken in thy\nfather’s despite; and kneel not to me at my hearth, for never\nwill I approve thy counsels and thy shameful flight.”",
        "(ll. 749-752)  Thus she spake, and measureless anguish seized the\nmaid; and over her eyes she cast her robe and poured forth a\nlamentation, until the hero took her by the hand and led her\nforth from the hall quivering with fear.  So they left the home\nof Circe.",
        "(ll. 753-756)  But they were not unmarked by the spouse of Zeus,\nson of Cronos; but Iris told her when she saw them faring from\nthe hall.  For Hera had bidden her watch what time they should\ncome to the ship; so again she urged her and spake:",
        "(ll. 757-769)  “Dear Iris, now come, if ever thou hast fulfilled\nmy bidding, hie thee away on light pinions, and bid Thetis arise\nfrom the sea and come hither.  For need of her is come upon me.\nThen go to the sea-beaches where the bronze anvils of Hephaestus\nare smitten by sturdy hammers, and tell him to still the blasts\nof fire until Argo pass by them.  Then go to Aeolus too, Aeolus\nwho rules the winds, children of the clear sky; and to him also\ntell my purpose so that he may make all winds cease under heaven\nand no breeze may ruffle the sea; yet let the breath of the west \nwind blow until the heroes have reached the Phaeacian isle of\nAlcinous.”",
        "(ll. 770-782)  So she spake, and straightway Iris leapt down from\nOlympus and cleft her way, with light wings outspread.  And she\nplunged into the Aegean Sea, where is the dwelling of Nereus. \nAnd she came to Thetis first and, by the promptings of Hera, told\nher tale and roused her to go to the goddess.  Next she came to\nHephaestus, and quickly made him cease from the clang of his iron\nhammers; and the smoke-grimed bellows were stayed from their\nblast.  And thirdly she came to Aeolus, the famous son of\nHippotas.  And when she had given her message to him also and\nrested her swift knees from her course, then Thetis leaving\nNereus and her sisters had come from the sea to Olympus to the\ngoddess Hera; and the goddess made her sit by her side and\nuttered her word:",
        "(ll. 783-832)  “Hearken now, lady Thetis, to what I am eager to\ntell thee.  Thou knowest how honoured in my heart is the hero,\nAeson’s son, and the others that have helped him in the contest,\nand how I saved them when they passed between the Wandering\nrocks, (5) where roar terrible storms of fire and the waves foam\nround the rugged reefs.  And now past the mighty rock of Scylla\nand Charybdis horribly belching, a course awaits them.  But thee\nindeed from thy infancy did I tend with my own hands and love\nbeyond all others that dwell in the salt sea because thou didst\nrefuse to share the couch of Zeus, for all his desire.  For to\nhim such deeds are ever dear, to embrace either goddesses or\nmortal women.  But in reverence for me and with fear in thy heart\nthou didst shrink from his love; and he then swore a mighty oath\nthat thou shouldst never be called the bride of an immortal god.\nYet he ceased not from spying thee against thy will, until\nreverend Themis declared to him the whole truth, how that it was\nthy fate to bear a son mightier than his sire; wherefore he gave\nthee up, for all his desire, fearing lest another should be his\nmatch and rule the immortals, and in order that he might ever\nhold his own dominion.  But I gave thee the best of the sons of\nearth to be thy husband, that thou mightest find a marriage dear\nto thy heart and bear children; and I summoned to the feast the\ngods, one and all.  And with my own hand I raised the bridal\ntorch, in return for the kindly honour thou didst pay me.  But\ncome, let me tell a tale that erreth not.  When thy son shall\ncome to the Elysian plain, he whom now in the home of Cheiron the\nCentaur water-nymphs are tending, though he still craves thy\nmother milk, it is fated that he be the husband of Medea, Aeetes’\ndaughter; do thou aid thy daughter-in-law as a mother-in-law\nshould, and aid Peleus himself.  Why is thy wrath so steadfast?\nHe was blinded by folly.  For blindness comes even upon the gods.\nSurely at my behest I deem that Hephaestus will cease from\nkindling the fury of his flame, and that Aeolus, son of Hippotas,\nwill check his swift rushing winds, all but the steady west wind,\nuntil they reach the havens of the Phaeacians; do thou devise a\nreturn without bane.  The rocks and the tyrannous waves are my\nfear, they alone, and them thou canst foil with thy sisters’ aid.\nAnd let them not fall in their helplessness into Charybdis lest\nshe swallow them at one gulp, or approach the hideous lair of\nScylla, Ausonian Scylla the deadly, whom night-wandering Hecate,\nwho is called Crataeis, (6) bare to Phoreys, lest swooping upon\nthem with her horrible jaws she destroy the chiefest of the\nheroes.  But guide their ship in the course where there shall be\nstill a hair’s breadth escape from destruction.”",
        "(ll. 833-841)  Thus she spake, and Thetis answered with these\nwords: “If the fury of the ravening flame and the stormy winds\ncease in very deed, surely will I promise boldly to save the\nship, even though the waves bar the way, if only the west wind\nblows fresh and clear.  But it is time to fare on a long and\nmeasureless path, in quest of my sisters who will aid me, and to\nthe spot where the ship’s hawsers are fastened, that at early\ndawn the heroes may take thought to win their home-return.”",
        "(ll. 842-855)  She spake, and darting down from the sky fell amid\nthe eddies of the dark blue sea; and she called to aid her the\nrest of the Nereids, her own sisters; and they heard her and\ngathered together; and Thetis declared to them Hera’s behests,\nand quickly sped them all on their way to the Ausonian sea.  And\nherself, swifter than the flash of an eye or the shafts of the\nsun, when it rises upwards from a far-distant land, hastened\nswiftly through the sea, until she reached the Aeaean beach of\nthe Tyrrhenian mainland.  And the heroes she found by the ship\ntaking their pastime with quoits and shooting of arrows; and she\ndrew near and just touched the hand of Aeaeus’ son Peleus, for he\nwas her husband; nor could anyone see her clearly, but she\nappeared to his eyes alone, and thus addressed him:",
        "(ll. 856-864)  “No longer now must ye stay sitting on the\nTyrrhenian beach, but at dawn loosen the hawsers of your swift\nship, in obedience to Hera, your helper.  For at her behest the\nmaiden daughters of Nereus have met together to draw your ship\nthrough the midst of the rocks which are called Planctae, (7) for\nthat is your destined path.  But do thou show my person to no\none, when thou seest us come to meet time, but keep it secret in\nthy mind, lest thou anger me still more than thou didst anger me\nbefore so recklessly.”",
        "(ll. 865-884)  She spake, and vanished into the depths of the\nsea; but sharp pain smote Peleus, for never before had he seen\nher come, since first she left her bridal chamber and bed in\nanger, on account of noble Achilles, then a babe.  For she ever\nencompassed the child’s mortal flesh in the night with the flame\nof fire; and day by day she anointed with ambrosia his tender\nframe, so that he might become immortal and that she might keep\noff from his body loathsome old age.  But Peleus leapt up from\nhis bed and saw his dear son gasping in the flame; and at the\nsight he uttered a terrible cry, fool that he was; and she heard\nit, and catching up the child threw him screaming to the ground,\nand herself like a breath of wind passed swiftly from the hall as\na dream and leapt into the sea, exceeding wroth, and thereafter\nreturned not again.  Wherefore blank amazement fettered his soul;\nnevertheless he declared to his comrades all the bidding of\nThetis.  And they broke off in the midst and hurriedly ceased\ntheir contests, and prepared their meal and earth-strewn beds,\nwhereon after supper they slept through the night as aforetime.",
        "(ll. 885-921)  Now when dawn the light-bringer was touching the\nedge of heaven, then at the coming of the swift west wind they\nwent to their thwarts from the land; and gladly did they draw up\nthe anchors from the deep and made the tackling ready in due\norder; and above spread the sail, stretching it taut with the\nsheets from the yard-arm.  And a fresh breeze wafted the ship on.\nAnd soon they saw a fair island, Anthemoessa, where the clear-\nvoiced Sirens, daughters of Achelous, used to beguile with their\nsweet songs whoever cast anchor there, and then destroy him. \nThem lovely Terpsichore, one of the Muses, bare, united with\nAchelous; and once they tended Demeter’s noble daughter still\nunwed, and sang to her in chorus; and at that time they were\nfashioned in part like birds and in part like maidens to behold.\nAnd ever on the watch from their place of prospect with its fair\nhaven, often from many had they taken away their sweet return,\nconsuming them with wasting desire; and suddenly to the heroes,\ntoo, they sent forth from their lips a lily-like voice.  And they\nwere already about to cast from the ship the hawsers to the\nshore, had not Thracian Orpheus, son of Oeagrus, stringing in his\nhands his Bistonian lyre, rung forth the hasty snatch of a\nrippling melody so that their ears might be filled with the sound\nof his twanging; and the lyre overcame the maidens’ voice.  And\nthe west wind and the sounding wave rushing astern bore the ship\non; and the Sirens kept uttering their ceaseless song.  But even\nso the goodly son of Teleon alone of the comrades leapt before\nthem all from the polished bench into the sea, even Butes, his\nsoul melted by the clear ringing voice of the Sirens; and he swam\nthrough the dark surge to mount the beach, poor wretch.  Quickly\nwould they have robbed him of his return then and there, but the\ngoddess that rules Eryx, Cypris, in pity snatched him away, while\nyet in the eddies, and graciously meeting him saved him to dwell\non the Lilybean height.  And the heroes, seized by anguish, left\nthe Sirens, but other perils still worse, destructive to ships,\nawaited them in the meeting-place of the seas.",
        "(ll. 922-981)  For on one side appeared the smooth rock of\nScylla; on the other Charybdis ceaselessly spouted and roared; in\nanother part the Wandering rocks were booming beneath the mighty\nsurge, where before the burning flame spurted forth from the top\nof the crags, above the rock glowing with fire, and the air was\nmisty with smoke, nor could you have seen the sun’s light.  Then,\nthough Hephaestus had ceased from his toils, the sea was still\nsending up a warm vapour.  Hereupon on this side and on that the\ndaughters of Nereus met them; and behind, lady Thetis set her\nhand to the rudder-blade, to guide them amid the Wandering rocks.\nAnd as when in fair weather herds of dolphins come up from the\ndepths and sport in circles round a ship as it speeds along, now\nseen in front, now behind, now again at the side and delight\ncomes to the sailors; so the Nereids darted upward and circled in\ntheir ranks round the ship Argo, while Thetis guided its course.\nAnd when they were about to touch the Wandering rocks,\nstraightway they raised the edge of their garments over their\nsnow-white knees, and aloft, on the very rocks and where the\nwaves broke, they hurried along on this side and on that apart\nfrom one another.  And the ship was raised aloft as the current\nsmote her, and all around the furious wave mounting up broke over\nthe rocks, which at one time touched the sky like towering crags,\nat another, down in the depths, were fixed fast at the bottom of\nthe sea and the fierce waves poured over them in floods.  And the\nNereids, even as maidens near some sandy beach roll their\ngarments up to their waists out of their way and sport with a\nshapely-rounded ball; then they catch it one from another and\nsend it high into the air; and it never touches the ground; so\nthey in turn one from another sent the ship through the air over\nthe waves, as it sped on ever away from the rocks; and round them\nthe water spouted and foamed.  And lord Hephaestus himself\nstanding on the summit of a smooth rock and resting his massy\nshoulder on the handle of his hammer, beheld them, and the spouse\nof Zeus beheld them as she stood above the gleaming heaven; and\nshe threw her arms round Athena, such fear seized her as she\ngazed.  And as long as the space of a day is lengthened out in\nspringtime, so long a time did they toil, heaving the ship\nbetween the loud-echoing rocks; then again the heroes caught the\nwind and sped onward; and swiftly they passed the mead of\nThrinacia, where the kine of Helios fed.  There the nymphs, like\nsea-mews, plunged beneath the depths, when they had fulfilled the\nbehests of the spouse of Zeus.  And at the same time the bleating\nof sheep came to the heroes through the mist and the lowing of\nkine, near at hand, smote their ears.  And over the dewy leas\nPhaethusa, the youngest of the daughters of Helios, tended the\nsheep, bearing in her hand a silver crook; while Lampetia,\nherding the kine, wielded a staff of glowing orichalcum (8) as\nshe followed.  These kine the heroes saw feeding by the river’s\nstream, over the plain and the water-meadow; not one of them was\ndark in hue but all were white as milk and glorying in their\nhorns of gold.  So they passed them by in the day-time, and when\nnight came on they were cleaving a great sea-gulf, rejoicing,\nuntil again early rising dawn threw light upon their course.",
        "(ll. 982-1013)  Fronting the Ionian gulf there lies an island in\nthe Ceraunian sea, rich in soil, with a harbour on both sides,\nbeneath which lies the sickle, as legend saith–grant me grace,\nO Muses, not willingly do I tell this tale of olden days –\nwherewith Cronos pitilessly mutilated his father; but others call\nit the reaping-hook of Demeter, goddess of the nether world.  For\nDemeter once dwelt in that island, and taught the Titans to reap\nthe ears of corn, all for the love of Macris.  Whence it is\ncalled Drepane, (9) the sacred nurse of the Phaeacians; and thus\nthe Phaeacians themselves are by birth of the blood of Uranus. \nTo them came Argo, held fast by many toils, borne by the breezes\nfrom the Thrinacian sea; and Alcinous and his people with kindly\nsacrifice gladly welcomed their coming; and over them all the\ncity made merry; thou wouldst say they were rejoicing over their\nown sons.  And the heroes themselves strode in gladness through\nthe throng, even as though they had set foot in the heart of\nHaemonia; but soon were they to arm and raise the battle-cry; so\nnear to them appeared a boundless host of Colchians, who had\npassed through the mouth of Pontus and between the Cyanean rocks\nin search of the chieftains.  They desired forthwith to carry off\nMedea to her father’s house apart from the rest, or else they\nthreatened with fierce cruelty to raise the dread war-cry both\nthen and thereafter on the coming of Aeetes.  But lordly Alcinous\nchecked them amid their eagerness for war.  For he longed to\nallay the lawless strife between both sides without the clash of\nbattle.  And the maiden in deadly fear often implored the\ncomrades of Aeson’s son, and often with her hands touched the\nknees of Arete, the bride of Aleinous:",
        "(ll. 1014-1028)  “I beseech thee, O queen, be gracious and\ndeliver me not to the Colchians to be borne to my father, if thou\nthyself too art one of the race of mortals, whose heart rushes\nswiftly to ruin from light transgressions.  For my firm sense\nforsook me–it was not for wantonness.  Be witness the sacred\nlight of Helios, be witness the rites of the maiden that wanders\nby night, daughter of Perses.  Not willingly did I haste from my\nhome with men of an alien race; but a horrible fear wrought on me\nto bethink me of flight when I sinned; other device was there\nnone.  Still my maiden’s girdle remains, as in the halls of my\nfather, unstained, untouched.  Pity me, lady, and turn thy lord\nto mercy; and may the immortals grant thee a perfect life, and\njoy, and children, and the glory of a city unravaged!”",
        "(ll. 1029-1030)  Thus did she implore Arete, shedding tears, and\nthus each of the chieftains in turn:",
        "(ll. 1031-1052)  “On your account, ye men of peerless might, and\non account of my toils in your ventures am I sorely afflicted;\neven I, by whose help ye yoked the bulls, and reaped the deadly\nharvest of the earthborn men; even I, through whom on your\nhomeward path ye shall bear to Haemonia the golden fleece.  Lo,\nhere am I, who have lost my country and my parents, who have lost\nmy home and all the delights of life; to you have I restored your\ncountry and your homes; with eyes of gladness ye will see again\nyour parents; but from me a heavy-handed god has raft all joy;\nand with strangers I wander, an accursed thing.  Fear your\ncovenant and your oaths, fear the Fury that avenges suppliants\nand the retribution of heaven, if I fall into Aeetes’ hands and\nam slain with grievous outrage.  To no shrines, no tower of\ndefence, no other refuge do I pay heed, but only to you.  Hard\nand pitiless in your cruelty!  No reverence have ye for me in\nyour heart though ye see me helpless, stretching my hands towards\nthe knees of a stranger queen; yet, when ye longed to seize the\nfleece, ye would have met all the Colchians face to thee and\nhaughty Aeetes himself; but now ye have forgotten your courage,\nnow that they are all alone and cut off.”",
        "(ll. 1053-1067)  Thus she spake, beseeching; and to whomsoever\nshe bowed in prayer, that man tried to give her heart and to\ncheck her anguish.  And in their hands they shook their sharp\npointed spears, and drew the swords from their sheaths; and they\nswore they would not hold back from giving succour, if she should\nmeet with an unrighteous judgement.  And the host were all\nwearied and Night came on them, Night that puts to rest the works\nof men, and lulled all the earth to sleep; but to the maid no\nsleep brought rest, but in her bosom her heart was wrung with\nanguish.  Even as when a toiling woman turns her spindle through\nthe night, and round her moan her orphan children, for she is a\nwidow, and down her cheeks fall the tears, as she bethinks her\nhow dreary a lot hath seized her; so Medea’s cheeks were wet; and\nher heart within her was in agony, pierced with sharp pain.",
        "(ll. 1068-1072)  Now within the palace in the city, as aforetime,\nlay lordly Alcinous and Arete, the revered wife of Alcinous, and\non their couch through the night they were devising plans about\nthe maiden; and him, as her wedded husband, the wife addressed\nwith loving words:",
        "(ll. 1073-1095)  “Yea, my friend, come, save the woe-stricken\nmaid from the Colchians and show grace to the Minyae.  Argos is\nnear our isle and the men of Haemonia; but Aeetes dwells not\nnear, nor do we know of Aeetes one whit: we hear but his name;\nbut this maiden of dread suffering hath broken my heart by her\nprayers.  O king, give her not up to the Colchians to be borne\nback to her father’s home.  She was distraught when first she\ngave him the drugs to charm the oxen; and next, to cure one ill\nby another, as in our sinning we do often, she fled from her\nhaughty sire’s heavy wrath.  But Jason, as I hear, is bound to\nher by mighty oaths that he will make her his wedded wife within\nhis halls.  Wherefore, my friend, make not, of thy will, Aeson’s\nson to be forsworn, nor let the father, if thou canst help, work\nwith angry heart some intolerable mischief on his child.  For\nfathers are all too jealous against their children; what wrong\ndid Nycteus devise against Antiope, fair of face!  What woes did\nDanae endure on the wide sea through her sire’s mad rage!  Of\nlate, and not far away, Echetus in wanton cruelty thrust spikes\nof bronze in his daughter’s eyes; and by a grievous fate is she\nwasting away, grinding grains of bronze in a dungeon’s gloom.”",
        "(ll. 1096-1097)  Thus she spake, beseeching; and by his wife’s\nwords his heart was softened, and thus he spake:",
        "(ll. 1098-1109)  “Arete, with arms I could drive forth the\nColchians, showing grace to the heroes for the maiden’s sake. \nBut I fear to set at nought the righteous judgment of Zeus.  Nor\nis it well to take no thought of Aeetes, as thou sayest: for none\nis more lordly than Aeetes.  And, if he willed, he might bring\nwar upon Hellas, though he dwell afar.  Wherefore it is right for\nme to deliver the judgement that in all men’s eyes shall be best;\nand I will not hide it from thee.  If she be yet a maid I decree\nthat they carry her back to her father; but if she shares a\nhusband’s bed, I will not separate her from her lord; nor, if she\nbear a child beneath her breast, will I give it up to an enemy.”",
        "(ll. 1110-1120)  Thus he spake, and at once sleep laid him to\nrest.  And she stored up in her heart the word of wisdom, and\nstraightway rose from her couch and went through the palace; and\nher handmaids came hasting together, eagerly tending their\nmistress.  But quietly she summoned her herald and addressed him,\nin her prudence urging Aeson’s son to wed the maiden, and not to\nimplore Alcinous; for he himself, she said, will decree to the\nColchians that if she is still a maid he will deliver her up to\nbe borne to her father’s house, but that if she shares a\nhusband’s bed he will not sever her from wedded love.",
        "(ll. 1121-1127)  Thus she spake, and quickly from the hall his\nfeet bore him, that he might declare to Jason the fair-omened\nspeech of Arete and the counsel of godfearing Alcinous.  And he\nfound the heroes watching in full armour in the haven of Hyllus,\nnear the city; and out he spake the whole message; and each\nhero’s heart rejoiced; for the word that he spake was welcome.",
        "(ll. 1128-1169)  And straightway they mingled a bowl to the\nblessed ones, as is right, and reverently led sheep to the altar,\nand for that very night prepared for the maiden the bridal couch\nin the sacred cave, where once dwelt Macris, the daughter of\nAristaeus, lord of honey, who discovered the works of bees and\nthe fatness of the olive, the fruit of labour.  She it was that\nfirst received in her bosom the Nysean son of Zeus in Abantian\nEuboea, and with honey moistened his parched lips when Hermes\nbore him out of the flame.  And Hera beheld it, and in wrath\ndrove her from the whole island.  And she accordingly came to\ndwell far off, in the sacred cave of the Phaeacians, and granted\nboundless wealth to the inhabitants.  There at that time did they\nspread a mighty couch; and thereon they laid the glittering\nfleece of gold, that so the marriage might be made honoured and\nthe theme of song.  And for them nymphs gathered flowers of\nvaried hue and bore them thither in their white bosoms; and a\nsplendour as of flame played round them all, such a light gleamed\nfrom the golden tufts.  And in their eyes it kindled a sweet\nlonging; yet for all her desire, awe withheld each one from\nlaying her hand thereon.  Some were called daughters of the river\nAegaeus; others dwelt round the crests of the Meliteian mount;\nand others were woodland nymphs from the plains.  For Hera\nherself, the spouse of Zeus, had sent them to do honour to Jason.\nThat cave is to this day called the sacred cave of Medea, where\nthey spread the fine and fragrant linen and brought these two\ntogether.  And the heroes in their hands wielded their spears for\nwar, lest first a host of foes should burst upon them for battle\nunawares, and, their heads enwreathed with leafy sprays, all in\nharmony, while Orpheus’ harp rang clear, sang the marriage song\nat the entrance to the bridal chamber.  Yet not in the house of\nAlcinous was the hero, Aeson’s son, minded to complete his\nmarriage, but in his father’s hall when he had returned home to\nIoleus; and such was the mind of Medea herself; but necessity led\nthem to wed at this time.  For never in truth do we tribes of\nwoe-stricken mortals tread the path of delight with sure foot;\nbut still some bitter affliction keeps pace with our joy.\nWherefore they too, though their souls were melted with sweet\nlove, were held by fear, whether the sentence of Alcinous would\nbe fulfilled.",
        "(ll. 1170-1227)  Now dawn returning with her beams divine\nscattered the gloomy night through the sky; and the island\nbeaches laughed out and the paths over the plains far off,\ndrenched with dew, and there was a din in the streets; the people\nwere astir throughout the city, and far away the Colchians were\nastir at the bounds of the isle of Macris.  And straightway to\nthem went Alcinous, by reason of his covenant, to declare his\npurpose concerning the maiden, and in his hand he held a golden\nstaff, his staff of justice, whereby the people had righteous\njudgments meted out to them throughout the city.  And with him in\norder due and arrayed in their harness of war went marching, band\nby band, the chiefs of the Phaeacians.  And from the towers came\nforth the women in crowds to gaze upon the heroes; and the\ncountry folk came to meet them when they heard the news, for Hera\nhad sent forth a true report.  And one led the chosen ram of his\nflock, and another a heifer that had never toiled; and others set\nhard by jars of wine for mixing; and the smoke of sacrifice leapt\nup far away.  And women bore fine linen, the fruit of much toil,\nas women will, and gifts of gold and varied ornaments as well,\nsuch as are brought to newly-wedded brides; and they marvelled\nwhen they saw the shapely forms and beauty of the gallant heroes,\nand among them the son of Oeagrus, oft beating the ground with\ngleaming sandal, to the time of his loud-ringing lyre and song.\nAnd all the nymphs together, whenever he recalled the marriage,\nuplifted the lovely bridal-chant; and at times again they sang\nalone as they circled in the dance, Hera, in thy honour; for it\nwas thou that didst put it into the heart of Arete to proclaim\nthe wise word of Alcinous.  And as soon as he had uttered the\ndecree of his righteous judgement, and the completion of the\nmarriage had been proclaimed, he took care that thus it should\nabide fixed; and no deadly fear touched him nor Aeetes’ grievous\nwrath, but he kept his judgement fast bound by unbroken oaths. \nSo when the Colchians learnt that they were beseeching in vain\nand he bade them either observe his judgements or hold their\nships away from his harbours and land, then they began to dread\nthe threats of their own king and besought Alcinous to receive\nthem as comrades; and there in the island long time they dwelt\nwith the Phaeacians, until in the course of years, the\nBacchiadae, a race sprung from Ephyra, (10) settled among them;\nand the Colchians passed to an island opposite; and thence they\nwere destined to reach the Ceraunian hills of the Abantes, and\nthe Nestaeans and Oricum; but all this was fulfilled after long\nages had passed.  And still the altars which Medea built on the\nspot sacred to Apollo, god of shepherds, receive yearly\nsacrifices in honour of the Fates and the Nymphs.  And when the\nMinyae departed many gifts of friendship did Alcinous bestow, and\nmany Arete; moreover she gave Medea twelve Phaeacian handmaids\nfrom the palace, to bear her company.  And on the seventh day\nthey left Drepane; and at dawn came a fresh breeze from Zeus. \nAnd onward they sped borne along by the wind’s breath.  Howbeit\nnot yet was it ordained for the heroes to set foot on Achaea,\nuntil they had toiled even in the furthest bounds of Libya.",
        "(ll. 1228-1250)  Now had they left behind the gulf named after\nthe Ambracians, now with sails wide spread the land of the\nCuretes, and next in order the narrow islands with the Echinades,\nand the land of Pelops was just descried; even then a baleful\nblast of the north wind seized them in mid-course and swept them\ntowards the Libyan sea nine nights and as many days, until they\ncame far within Syrtis, wherefrom is no return for ships, when\nthey are once forced into that gulf.  For on every hand are\nshoals, on every hand masses of seaweed from the depths; and over\nthem the light foam of the wave washes without noise; and there\nis a stretch of sand to the dim horizon; and there moveth nothing\nthat creeps or flies.  Here accordingly the flood-tide–for\nthis tide often retreats from the land and bursts back again over\nthe beach coming on with a rush and roar–thrust them suddenly\non to the innermost shore, and but little of the keel was left in\nthe water.  And they leapt forth from the ship, and sorrow seized\nthem when they gazed on the mist and the levels of vast land\nstretching far like a mist and continuous into the distance; no\nspot for water, no path, no steading of herdsmen did they descry\nafar off, but all the scene was possessed by a dead calm.  And\nthus did one hero, vexed in spirit, ask another:",
        "(ll. 1251-1258)  “What land is this?  Whither has the tempest\nhurled us?  Would that, reckless of deadly fear, we had dared to\nrush on by that same path between the clashing rocks!  Better\nwere it to have overleapt the will of Zeus and perished in\nventuring some mighty deed.  But now what should we do, held back\nby the winds to stay here, if ever so short a time?  How desolate\nlooms before us the edge of the limitless land!”",
        "(ll. 1259-1276)  Thus one spake; and among them Ancaeus the\nhelmsman, in despair at their evil case, spoke with grieving\nheart: “Verily we are undone by a terrible doom; there is no\nescape from ruin; we must suffer the cruellest woes, having\nfallen on this desolation, even though breezes should blow from\nthe land; for, as I gaze far around, on every side do I behold a\nsea of shoals, and masses of water, fretted line upon line, run\nover the hoary sand.  And miserably long ago would our sacred\nship have been shattered far from the shore; but the tide itself\nbore her high on to the land from the deep sea.  But now the tide\nrushes back to the sea, and only the foam, whereon no ship can\nsail, rolls round us, just covering the land.  Wherefore I deem\nthat all hope of our voyage and of our return is cut off.  Let\nsomeone else show his skill; let him sit at the helm the man that\nis eager for our deliverance.  But Zeus has no will to fulfil our\nday of return after all our toils.”",
        "(ll. 1277-1317)  Thus he spake with tears, and all of them that\nhad knowledge of ships agreed thereto; but the hearts of all grew\nnumb, and pallor overspread their cheeks.  And as, like lifeless\nspectres, men roam through a city awaiting the issue of war or of\npestilence, or some mighty storm which overwhelms the countless\nlabours of oxen, when the images of their own accord sweat and\nrun down with blood, and bellowings are heard in temples, or when\nat mid-day the sun draws on night from heaven, and the stars\nshine clear through the mist; so at that time along the endless\nstrand the chieftains wandered, groping their way.  Then\nstraightway dark evening came upon them; and piteously did they\nembrace each other and say farewell with tears, that they might,\neach one apart from his fellow, fall on the sand and die.  And\nthis way and that they went further to choose a resting-place;\nand they wrapped their heads in their cloaks and, fasting and\nunfed, lay down all that night and the day, awaiting a piteous\ndeath.  But apart the maidens huddled together lamented beside\nthe daughter of Aeetes.  And as when, forsaken by their mother,\nunfledged birds that have fallen from a cleft in the rock chirp\nshrilly; or when by the banks of fair-flowing Pactolus, swans\nraise their song, and all around the dewy meadow echoes and the\nriver’s fair stream; so these maidens, laying in the dust their\ngolden hair, all through the night wailed their piteous lament.\nAnd there all would have parted from life without a name and\nunknown to mortal men, those bravest of heroes, with their task\nunfulfilled; but as they pined in despair, the heroine-nymphs,\nwarders of Libya, had pity on them, they who once found Athena,\nwhat time she leapt in gleaming armour from her father’s head,\nand bathed her by Trito’s waters.  It was noon-tide and the\nfiercest rays of the sun were scorching Libya; they stood near\nAeson’s son, and lightly drew the cloak from his head.  And the\nhero cast down his eyes and looked aside, in reverence for the\ngoddesses, and as he lay bewildered all alone they addressed him\nopenly with gentle words:",
        "(ll. 1318-1329)  “Ill-starred one, why art thou so smitten with\ndespair?  We know how ye went in quest of the golden fleece; we\nknow each toil of yours, all the mighty deeds ye wrought in your\nwanderings over land and sea.  We are the solitary ones,\ngoddesses of the land, speaking with human voice, the heroines,\nLibya’s warders and daughters.  Up then; be not thus afflicted in\nthy misery, and rouse thy comrades.  And when Amphitrite has\nstraightway loosed Poseidon’s swift-wheeled car, then do ye pay\nto your mother a recompense for all her travail when she bare you\nso long in her womb; and so ye may return to the divine land of\nAchaea.”",
        "(ll. 1330-1332)  Thus they spake, and with the voice vanished at\nonce, where they stood.  But Jason sat upon the earth as he gazed\naround, and thus cried:",
        "(ll. 1333-1336)  “Be gracious, noble goddesses of the desert, yet\nthe saying about our return I understand not clearly.  Surely I\nwill gather together my comrades and tell them, if haply we can\nfind some token of our escape, for the counsel of many is\nbetter.”",
        "(ll. 1337-1346)  He spake, and leapt to his feet, and shouted\nafar to his comrades, all squalid with dust, like a lion when he\nroars through the woodland seeking his mate; and far off in the\nmountains the glens tremble at the thunder of his voice; and the\noxen of the field and the herdsmen shudder with fear; yet to them\nJason’s voice was no whit terrible the voice of a comrade calling\nto his friends.  And with looks downcast they gathered near, and\nhard by where the ship lay he made them sit down in their grief\nand the women with them, and addressed them and told them\neverything:",
        "(ll. 1347-1362)  “Listen, friends; as I lay in my grief, three\ngoddesses girded with goat-skins from the neck downwards round\nthe back and waist, like maidens, stood over my head nigh at\nhand; and they uncovered me, drawing my cloak away with light\nhand, and they bade me rise up myself and go and rouse you, and\npay to our mother a bounteous recompense for all her travail when\nshe bare us so long in her womb, when Amphitrite shall have\nloosed Poseidon’s swift-wheeled car.  But I cannot fully\nunderstand concerning this divine message.  They said indeed that\nthey were heroines, Libya’s warders and daughters; and all the\ntoils that we endured aforetime by land and sea, all these they\ndeclared that they knew full well.  Then I saw them no more in\ntheir place, but a mist or cloud came between and hid them from\nmy sight.”",
        "(ll. 1363-1369)  Thus he spake, and all marvelled as they heard.\nThen was wrought for the Minyae the strangest of portents.  From\nthe sea to the land leapt forth a monstrous horse, of vast size,\nwith golden mane tossing round his neck; and quickly from his\nlimbs he shook off abundant spray and started on his course, with\nfeet like the wind.  And at once Peleus rejoiced and spake among\nthe throng of his comrades:",
        "(ll. 1370-1379)  “I deem that Poseidon’s ear has even now been\nloosed by the hands of his dear wife, and I divine that our\nmother is none else than our ship herself; for surely she bare us\nin her womb and groans unceasingly with grievous travailing.  But\nwith unshaken strength and untiring shoulders will we lift her up\nand bear her within this country of sandy wastes, where yon\nswift-footed steed has sped before.  For he will not plunge\nbeneath the earth; and his hoof-prints, I ween, will point us to\nsome bay above the sea.”",
        "(ll. 1380-1392)  Thus he spake, and the fit counsel pleased all.\nThis is the tale the Muses told; and I sing obedient to the\nPierides, and this report have I heard most truly; that ye, O\nmightiest far of the sons of kings, by your might and your valour\nover the desert sands of Libya raised high aloft on your\nshoulders the ship and all that ye brought therein, and bare her\ntwelve days and nights alike.  Yet who could tell the pain and\ngrief which they endured in that toil?  Surely they were of the\nblood of the immortals, such a task did they take on them,\nconstrained by necessity.  How forward and how far they bore her\ngladly to the waters of the Tritonian lake!  How they strode in\nand set her down from their stalwart shoulders!",
        "(ll. 1393-1421)  Then, like raging hounds, they rushed to search\nfor a spring; for besides their suffering and anguish, a parching\nthirst lay upon them, and not in vain did they wander; but they\ncame to the sacred plain where Ladon, the serpent of the land,\ntill yesterday kept watch over the golden apples in the garden of\nAtlas; and all around the nymphs, the Hesperides, were busied,\nchanting their lovely song.  But at that time, stricken by\nHeracles, he lay fallen by the trunk of the apple-tree; only the\ntip of his tail was still writhing; but from his head down his\ndark spine he lay lifeless; and where the arrows had left in his\nblood the bitter gall of the Lernaean hydra, flies withered and\ndied over the festering wounds.  And close at hand the\nHesperides, their white arms flung over their golden heads,\nlamented shrilly; and the heroes drew near suddenly; but the\nmaidens, at their quick approach, at once became dust and earth\nwhere they stood.  Orpheus marked the divine portent, and for his\ncomrades addressed them in prayer: “O divine ones, fair and kind,\nbe gracious, O queens, whether ye be numbered among the heavenly\ngoddesses, or those beneath the earth, or be called the Solitary\nnymphs; come, O nymphs, sacred race of Oceanus, appear manifest\nto our longing eyes and show us some spring of water from the\nrock or some sacred flow gushing from the earth, goddesses,\nwherewith we may quench the thirst that burns us unceasingly. \nAnd if ever again we return in our voyaging to the Achaean land,\nthen to you among the first of goddesses with willing hearts will\nwe bring countless gifts, libations and banquets.”",
        "(ll. 1422-1431)  So he spake, beseeching them with plaintive\nvoice; and they from their station near pitied their pain; and\nlo!  First of all they caused grass to spring from the earth; and\nabove the grass rose up tall shoots, and then flourishing\nsaplings grew standing upright far above the earth.  Hespere\nbecame a poplar and Eretheis an elm, and Aegle a willow’s sacred\ntrunk.  And forth from these trees their forms looked out, as\nclear as they were before, a marvel exceeding great, and Aegle\nspake with gentle words answering their longing looks:",
        "(ll. 1432-1449)  “Surely there has come hither a mighty succour\nto your toils, that most accursed man, who robbed our guardian\nserpent of life and plucked the golden apples of the goddesses\nand is gone; and has left bitter grief for us.  For yesterday\ncame a man most fell in wanton violence, most grim in form; and\nhis eyes flashed beneath his scowling brow; a ruthless wretch;\nand he was clad in the skin of a monstrous lion of raw hide,\nuntanned; and he bare a sturdy bow of olive, and a bow, wherewith\nhe shot and killed this monster here.  So he too came, as one\ntraversing the land on foot, parched with thirst; and he rushed\nwildly through this spot, searching for water, but nowhere was he\nlike to see it.  Now here stood a rock near the Tritonian lake;\nand of his own device, or by the prompting of some god, he smote\nit below with his foot; and the water gushed out in full flow.\nAnd he, leaning both his hands and chest upon the ground, drank a\nhuge draught from the rifted rock, until, stooping like a beast\nof the field, he had satisfied his mighty maw.”",
        "(ll. 1450-1457)  Thus she spake; and they gladly with joyful\nsteps ran to the spot where Aegle had pointed out to them the\nspring, until they reached it.  And as when earth-burrowing ants\ngather in swarms round a narrow cleft, or when flies lighting\nupon a tiny drop of sweet honey cluster round with insatiate\neagerness; so at that time, huddled together, the Minyae thronged\nabout the spring from the rock.  And thus with wet lips one cried\nto another in his delight:",
        "(ll. 1458-1460)  “Strange!  In very truth Heracles, though far\naway, has saved his comrades, fordone with thirst.  Would that we\nmight find him on his way as we pass through the mainland!”",
        "(ll. 1461-1484)  So they spake, and those who were ready for this\nwork answered, and they separated this way and that, each\nstarting to search.  For by the night winds the footsteps had\nbeen effaced where the sand was stirred.  The two sons of Boreas\nstarted up, trusting in their wings; and Euphemus, relying on his\nswift feet, and Lynceus to cast far his piercing eyes; and with\nthem darted off Canthus, the fifth.  He was urged on by the doom\nof the gods and his own courage, that he might learn for certain\nfrom Heracles where he had left Polyphemus, son of Eilatus; for\nhe was minded to question him on every point concerning his\ncomrade.  But that hero had founded a glorious city among the\nMysians, and, yearning for his home-return, had passed far over\nthe mainland in search of Argo; and in time he reached the land\nof the Chalybes, who dwell near the sea; there it was that his\nfate subdued him.  And to him a monument stands under a tall\npoplar, just facing the sea.  But that day Lynceus thought he saw\nHeracles all alone, far off, over measureless land, as a man at\nthe month’s beginning sees, or thinks he sees, the moon through a\nbank of cloud.  And he returned and told his comrades that no\nother searcher would find Heracles on his way, and they also came\nback, and swift-footed Euphemus and the twin sons of Thracian\nBoreas, after a vain toil.",
        "(ll. 1485-1501)  But thee, Canthus, the fates of death seized in\nLibya.  On pasturing flocks didst thou light; and there followed\na shepherd who, in defence of his own sheep, while thou weft\nleading them off (11) to thy comrades in their need, slew thee by\nthe cast of a stone; for he was no weakling, Caphaurus, the\ngrandson of Lycoreian Phoebus and the chaste maiden Acacallis,\nwhom once Minos drove from home to dwell in Libya, his own\ndaughter, when she was bearing the gods’ heavy load; and she bare\nto Phoebus a glorious son, whom they call Amphithemis and\nGaramas.  And Amphithemis wedded a Tritonian nymph; and she bare\nto him Nasamon and strong Caphaurus, who on that day in defending\nhis sheep slew Canthus.  But he escaped not the chieftains’\navenging hands, when they learned the deed he had done.  And the\nMinyae, when they knew it, afterwards took up the corpse and\nburied it in the earth, mourning; and the sheep they took with\nthem.",
        "(ll. 1502-1536)  Thereupon on the same day a pitiless fate seized\nMopsus too, son of Ampycus; and he escaped not a bitter doom by\nhis prophesying; for there is no averting of death.  Now there\nlay in the sand, avoiding the midday heat, a dread serpent, too\nsluggish of his own will to strike at an unwilling foe, nor yet\nwould he dart full face at one that would shrink back.  But into\nwhatever of all living beings that life-giving earth sustains\nthat serpent once injects his black venom, his path to Hades\nbecomes not so much as a cubit’s length, not even if Paeeon, if\nit is right for me to say this openly, should tend him, when its\nteeth have only grazed the skin.  For when over Libya flew\ngodlike Perseus Eurymedon   for by that name his mother called\nhim–bearing to the king the Gorgon’s head newly severed, all\nthe drops of dark blood that fell to the earth, produced a brood\nof those serpents.  Now Mopsus stepped on the end of its spine,\nsetting thereon the sole of his left foot; and it writhed round\nin pain and bit and tore the flesh between the shin and the\nmuscles.  And Medea and her handmaids fled in terror; but Canthus\nbravely felt the bleeding wound; for no excessive pain harassed\nhim.  Poor wretch!  Already a numbness that loosed his limbs was\nstealing beneath his skin, and a thick mist was spreading over\nhis eyes.  Straightway his heavy limbs sank helplessly to the\nground and he grew cold; and his comrades and the hero, Aeson’s\nson, gathered round, marvelling at the close-coming doom.  Nor\nyet though dead might he lie beneath the sun even for a little\nspace.  For at once the poison began to rot his flesh within, and\nthe hair decayed and fell from the skin.  And quickly and in\nhaste they dug a deep grave with mattocks of bronze; and they\ntore their hair, the heroes and the maidens, bewailing the dead\nman’s piteous suffering; and when he had received due burial\nrites, thrice they marched round the tomb in full armour, and\nheaped above him a mound of earth.",
        "(ll. 1537-1553)  But when they had gone aboard, as the south wind\nblew over the sea, and they were searching for a passage to go\nforth from the Tritonian lake, for long they had no device, but\nall the day were borne on aimlessly.  And as a serpent goes\nwrithing along his crooked path when the sun’s fiercest rays\nscorch him; and with a hiss he turns his head to this side and\nthat, and in his fury his eyes glow like sparks of fire, until he\ncreeps to his lair through a cleft in the rock; so Argo seeking\nan outlet from the lake, a fairway for ships, wandered for a long\ntime.  Then straightway Orpheus bade them bring forth from the\nship Apollo’s massy tripod and offer it to the gods of the land\nas propitiation for their return.  So they went forth and set\nApollo’s gift on the shore; then before them stood, in the form\nof a youth, farswaying Triton, and he lifted a clod from the\nearth and offered it as a stranger’s gift, and thus spake:",
        "(ll. 1554-1561)  “Take it, friends, for no stranger’s gift of\ngreat worth have I here by me now to place in the hands of those\nwho beseech me.  But if ye are searching for a passage through\nthis sea, as often is the need of men passing through a strange\nland, I will declare it.  For my sire Poseidon has made me to be\nwell versed in this sea.  And I rule the shore if haply in your\ndistant land you have ever heard of Eurypylus, born in Libya, the\nhome of wild beasts.”",
        "(ll. 1562-1563)  Thus he spake, and readily Euphemus held out his\nhands towards the clod, and thus addressed him in reply:",
        "(ll. 1564-1570)  “If haply, hero, thou knowest aught of Apis (12)\nand the sea of Minos, tell us truly, who ask it of you.  For not\nof our will have we come hither, but by the stress of heavy\nstorms have we touched the borders of this land, and have borne\nour ship aloft on our shoulders to the waters of this lake over\nthe mainland, grievously burdened; and we know not where a\npassage shows itself for our course to the land of Pelops.”",
        "(ll. 1571-1585)  So he spake; and Triton stretched out his hand\nand showed afar the sea and the lake’s deep mouth, and then\naddressed them: “That is the outlet to the sea, where the deep\nwater lies unmoved and dark; on each side roll white breakers\nwith shining crests; and the way between for your passage out is\nnarrow.  And that sea stretches away in mist to the divine land\nof Pelops beyond Crete; but hold to the right, when ye have\nentered the swell of the sea from the lake, and steer your course\nhugging the land, as long as it trends to the north; but when the\ncoast bends, falling away in the other direction, then your\ncourse is safely laid for you if ye go straight forward from the\nprojecting cape.  But go in joy, and as for labour let there be\nno grieving that limbs in youthful vigour should still toil.”",
        "(ll. 1586-1596)  He spake with kindly counsel; and they at once\nwent aboard, intent to come forth from the lake by the use of\noars.  And eagerly they sped on; meanwhile Triton took up the\nmighty tripod, and they saw him enter the lake; but thereafter\ndid no one mark how he vanished so near them along with the\ntripod.  But their hearts were cheered, for that one of the\nblessed had met them in friendly guise.  And they bade Aeson’s\nson offer to him the choicest of the sheep and when he had slain\nit chant the hymn of praise.  And straightway he chose in haste\nand raising the victim slew it over the stern, and prayed with\nthese words:",
        "(ll. 1597-1600)  “Thou god, who hast manifested thyself on the\nborders of this land, whether the daughters born of the sea call\nthee Triton, the great sea-marvel, or Phoreys, or Nereus, be\ngracious, and grant the return home dear to our hearts.”",
        "(ll. 1601-1637)  He spake, and cut the victim’s throat over the\nwater and cast it from the stern.  And the god rose up from the\ndepths in form such as he really was.  And as when a man trains a\nswift steed for the broad race-course, and runs along, grasping\nthe bushy mane, while the steed follows obeying his master, and\nrears his neck aloft in his pride, and the gleaming bit rings\nloud as he champs it in his jaws from side to side; so the god,\nseizing hollow Argo’s keel, guided her onward to the sea.  And\nhis body, from the crown of his head, round his back and waist as\nfar as the belly, was wondrously like that of the blessed ones in\nform; but below his sides the tail of a sea monster lengthened\nfar, forking to this side and that; and he smote the surface of\nthe waves with the spines, which below parted into curving fins,\nlike the horns of the new moon.  And he guided Argo on until he\nsped her into the sea on her course; and quickly he plunged into\nthe vast abyss; and the heroes shouted when they gazed with their\neyes on that dread portent.  There is the harbour of Argo and\nthere are the signs of her stay, and altars to Poseidon and\nTriton; for during that day they tarried.  But at dawn with sails\noutspread they sped on before the breath of the west wind,\nkeeping the desert land on their right.  And on the next morn\nthey saw the headland and the recess of the sea, bending inward\nbeyond the jutting headland.  And straightway the west wind\nceased, and there came the breeze of the clear south wind; and\ntheir hearts rejoiced at the sound it made.  But when the sun\nsank and the star returned that bids the shepherd fold, which\nbrings rest to wearied ploughmen, at that time the wind died down\nin the dark night; so they furled the sails and lowered the tall\nmast and vigorously plied their polished oars all night and\nthrough the day, and again when the next night came on.  And\nrugged Carpathus far away welcomed them; and thence they were to\ncross to Crete, which rises in the sea above other islands.",
        "(ll. 1638-1653)  And Talos, the man of bronze, as he broke off\nrocks from the hard cliff, stayed them from fastening hawsers to\nthe shore, when they came to the roadstead of Dicte’s haven.  He\nwas of the stock of bronze, of the men sprung from ash-trees, the\nlast left among the sons of the gods; and the son of Cronos gave\nhim to Europa to be the warder of Crete and to stride round the\nisland thrice a day with his feet of bronze.  Now in all the rest\nof his body and limbs was he fashioned of bronze and\ninvulnerable; but beneath the sinew by his ankle was a blood-red\nvein; and this, with its issues of life and death, was covered by\na thin skin.  So the heroes, though outworn with toil, quickly\nbacked their ship from the land in sore dismay.  And now far from\nCrete would they have been borne in wretched plight, distressed\nboth by thirst and pain, had not Medea addressed them as they\nturned away:",
        "(ll. 1654-1658)  “Hearken to me.  For I deem that I alone can\nsubdue for you that man, whoever he be, even though his frame be\nof bronze throughout, unless his life too is everlasting.  But be\nready to keep your ship here beyond the cast of his stones, till\nhe yield the victory to me.”",
        "(ll. 1659-1672)  Thus she spake; and they drew the ship out of\nrange, resting on their oars, waiting to see what plan unlooked\nfor she would bring to pass; and she, holding the fold of her\npurple robe over her cheeks on each side, mounted on the deck;\nand Aeson’s son took her hand in his and guided her way along the\nthwarts.  And with songs did she propitiate and invoke the Death-\nspirits, devourers of life, the swift hounds of Hades, who,\nhovering through all the air, swoop down on the living.  Kneeling\nin supplication, thrice she called on them with songs, and thrice\nwith prayers; and, shaping her soul to mischief, with her hostile\nglance she bewitched the eyes of Talos, the man of bronze; and\nher teeth gnashed bitter wrath against him, and she sent forth\nbaneful phantoms in the frenzy of her rage.",
        "(ll. 1673-1693)  Father Zeus, surely great wonder rises in my\nmind, seeing that dire destruction meets us not from disease and\nwounds alone, but lo! even from afar, may be, it tortures us!  So\nTalos, for all his frame of bronze, yielded the victory to the\nmight of Medea the sorceress.  And as he was heaving massy rocks\nto stay them from reaching the haven, he grazed his ankle on a\npointed crag; and the ichor gushed forth like melted lead; and\nnot long thereafter did he stand towering on the jutting cliff.\nBut even as some huge pine, high up on the mountains, which\nwoodmen have left half hewn through by their sharp axes when they\nreturned from the forest–at first it shivers in the wind by\nnight, then at last snaps at the stump and crashes down; so Talos\nfor a while stood on his tireless feet, swaying to and fro, when\nat last, all strengthless, fell with a mighty thud.  For that\nnight there in Crete the heroes lay; then, just as dawn was\ngrowing bright, they built a shrine to Minoan Athena, and drew\nwater and went aboard, so that first of all they might by rowing\npass beyond Salmone’s height.",
        "(ll. 1694-1730)  But straightway as they sped over the wide\nCretan sea night scared them, that night which they name the Pall\nof Darkness; the stars pierced not that fatal night nor the beams\nof the moon, but black chaos descended from heaven, or haply some\nother darkness came, rising from the nethermost depths.  And the\nheroes, whether they drifted in Hades or on the waters, knew not\none whit; but they committed their return to the sea in helpless\ndoubt whither it was bearing them.  But Jason raised his hands\nand cried to Phoebus with mighty voice, calling on him to save\nthem; and the tears ran down in his distress; and often did he\npromise to bring countless offerings to Pytho, to Amyclae, and to\nOrtygia.  And quickly, O son of Leto, swift to hear, didst thou\ncome down from heaven to the Melantian rocks, which lie there in\nthe sea.  Then darting upon one of the twin peaks, thou raisedst\naloft in thy right hand thy golden bow; and the bow flashed a\ndazzling gleam all round.  And to their sight appeared a small\nisland of the Sporades, over against the tiny isle Hippuris, and\nthere they cast anchor and stayed; and straightway dawn arose and\ngave them light; and they made for Apollo a glorious abode in a\nshady wood, and a shady altar, calling on Phoebus the “Gleamer”,\nbecause of the gleam far-seen; and that bare island they called\nAnaphe, (13) for that Phoebus had revealed it to men sore\nbewildered.  And they sacrificed all that men could provide for\nsacrifice on a desolate strand; wherefore when Medea’s Phaeacian\nhandmaids saw them pouring water for libations on the burning\nbrands, they could no longer restrain laughter within their\nbosoms, for that ever they had seen oxen in plenty slain in the\nhalls of Alcinous.  And the heroes delighted in the jest and\nattacked them with taunting words; and merry railing and\ncontention flung to and fro were kindled among them.  And from\nthat sport of the heroes such scoffs do the women fling at the\nmen in that island whenever they propitiate with sacrifices\nApollo the gleaming god, the warder of Anaphe.",
        "(ll. 1731-1740)  But when they had loosed the hawsers thence in\nfair weather, then Euphemus bethought him of a dream of the\nnight, reverencing the glorious son of Maia.  For it seemed to\nhim that the god-given clod of earth held in his palm close to\nhis breast was being suckled by white streams of milk, and that\nfrom it, little though it was, grew a woman like a virgin; and\nhe, overcome by strong desire, lay with her in love’s embrace;\nand united with her he pitied her, as though she were a maiden\nwhom he was feeding with his own milk; but she comforted him with\ngentle words:",
        "(ll. 1741-1745)  “Daughter of Triton am I, dear friend, and nurse\nof thy children, no maiden; Triton and Libya are my parents.  But\nrestore me to the daughters of Nereus to dwell in the sea near\nAnaphe; I shall return again to the light of the sun, to prepare\na home for thy descendants.”",
        "(ll. 1746-1748)  Of this he stored in his heart the memory, and\ndeclared it to Aeson’s son; and Jason pondered a prophecy of the\nFar-Darter and lifted up his voice and said:",
        "(ll. 1749-1754)  “My friend, great and glorious renown has fallen\nto thy lot.  For of this clod when thou hast cast it into the\nsea, the gods will make an island, where thy children’s children\nshall dwell; for Triton gave this to thee as a stranger’s gift\nfrom the Libyan mainland.  None other of the immortals it was\nthan he that gave thee this when he met thee.”",
        "(ll. 1755-1764)  Thus he spake; and Euphemus made not vain the\nanswer of Aeson’s son; but, cheered by the prophecy, he cast the\nclod into the depths.  Therefrom rose up an island, Calliste,\nsacred nurse of the sons of Euphemus, who in former days dwelt in\nSintian Lemnos, and from Lemnos were driven forth by Tyrrhenians\nand came to Sparta as suppliants; and when they left Sparta,\nTheras, the goodly son of Autesion, brought them to the island\nCalliste, and from himself he gave it the name of Thera.  But\nthis befell after the days of Euphemus.",
        "(ll. 1765-1772)  And thence they steadily left behind long\nleagues of sea and stayed on the beach of Aegina; and at once\nthey contended in innocent strife about the fetching of water,\nwho first should draw it and reach the ship.  For both their need\nand the ceaseless breeze urged them on.  There even to this day \ndo the youths of the Myrmidons take up on their shoulders full-\nbrimming jars, and with swift feet strive for victory in the\nrace.",
        "(ll. 1773-1781)  Be gracious, race of blessed chieftains!  And\nmay these songs year after year be sweeter to sing among men. \nFor now have I come to the glorious end of your toils; for no\nadventure befell you as ye came home from Aegina, and no tempest\nof winds opposed you; but quietly did ye skirt the Cecropian land\nand Aulis inside of Euboea and the Opuntian cities of the\nLocrians, and gladly did ye step forth upon the beach of Pagasae.",
