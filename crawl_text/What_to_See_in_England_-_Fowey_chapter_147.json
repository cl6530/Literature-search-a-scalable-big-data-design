        "Fowey, now little more than a fishing village and holiday resort, was\nonce the chief port in Cornwall, and the equal of Plymouth and\nDartmouth, a position it owed to its fine harbour, formed by the mouth\nof the river Fowey, on which it stands. On the west side of the harbour\nstands St. Catherine’s Castle, dating from the reign of Henry VIII., and\non the east the ruins of St. Saviour’s Chapel, an old church. There are\nalso remains of two square stone towers, erected for the protection of\nthe entrance to the harbour in the reign of Edward IV. Between these\nforts, in mediaeval days, the men of Fowey used to draw a chain as an\nadditional security. The houses are built chiefly of stone, but the\nstreets are so narrow and full of angles that it is difficult for a\nvehicle of any size to pass through them. In the reign of Edward III. it\nsent forty-seven vessels to assist in the siege of Calais.",
        "A heavy blow was dealt to the town by Edward IV. After he had concluded\npeace with France, the men of Fowey continued to make prizes of whatever\nFrench ships they could capture, and refused to give up their piratical\nways. This so incensed the king, that the ringleaders in the matter were\nsummarily executed, a heavy fine was levied upon the town, and its\nvessels handed over to the port of Dartmouth, as a lesson against\npiracy. This treatment of Fowey seems a little hard in view of the fact\nthat Dartmouth men were constantly raiding the coasts of Brittany.",
        "The church, built in the reign of Edward IV. and restored in 1876, has\none of the highest towers in Cornwall. The interior has a good timber\nroof, a carved oak pulpit, an old font, and several interesting\nmonuments to the Treffry and Rashleigh families.",
        "The finest and most interesting house in the town is Place House, the\nseat of the Treffrys, who have been connected with Fowey for many\ngenerations. Many of the apartments are exceedingly interesting,\nespecially the hall, with its fine oak roof. The present owner allows\nthe hall and other portions to be shown to visitors.",
