        "TRAVEL, in the younger sort, is a part of education, in the elder, a part of experience.  He\nthat travelleth into a country, before he hath some\nentrance into the language, goeth to school, and\nnot to travel.  That young men travel under some\ntutor, or grave servant, I allow well; so that he be\nsuch a one that hath the language, and hath been\nin the country before; whereby he may be able\nto tell them what things are worthy to be seen, in\nthe country where they go; what acquaintances\nthey are to seek; what exercises, or discipline, the\nplace yieldeth.  For else, young men shall go\nhooded, and look abroad little.  It is a strange thing,\nthat in sea voyages, where there is nothing to be\nseen, but sky and sea, men should make diaries;\nbut in land-travel, wherein so much is to be observed, for the most part they omit it; as if chance\nwere fitter to be registered, than observation.  Let\ndiaries, therefore, be brought in use.  The things to\nbe seen and observed are: the courts of princes,\nespecially when they give audience to ambassadors; the courts of justice, while they sit and hear\ncauses; and so of consistories ecclesiastic; the\nchurches and monasteries, with the monuments\nwhich are therein extant; the walls and fortifications of cities, and towns, and so the heavens and\nharbors; antiquities and ruins; libraries; colleges,\ndisputations, and lectures, where any are; shipping and navies; houses and gardens of state and\npleasure, near great cities; armories; arsenals;\nmagazines; exchanges; burses; warehouses; exercises of horsemanship, fencing, training of soldiers, and the like; comedies, such whereunto the\nbetter sort of persons do resort; treasuries of jewels\nand robes; cabinets and rarities; and, to conclude,\nwhatsoever is memorable, in the places where\nthey go.  After all which, the tutors, or servants,\nought to make diligent inquiry.  As for triumphs,\nmasks, feasts, weddings, funerals, capital executions, and such shows, men need not to be put in\nmind of them; yet are they not to be neglected.  If\nyou will have a young man to put his travel into a\nlittle room, and in short time to gather much, this\nyou must do.  First, as was said, he must have some\nentrance into the language before he goeth.  Then\nhe must have such a servant, or tutor, as knoweth\nthe country, as was likewise said.  Let him carry\nwith him also, some card or book, describing the\ncountry where he travelleth; which will be a good\nkey to his inquiry.  Let him keep also a diary.  Let\nhim not stay long, in one city or town; more or less\nas the place deserveth, but not long; nay, when he\nstayeth in one city or town, let him change his\nlodging from one end and part of the town, to another; which is a great adamant of acquaintance.\nLet him sequester himself, from the company of\nhis countrymen, and diet in such places, where\nthere is good company of the nation where he\ntravelleth.  Let him, upon his removes from one\nplace to another, procure recommendation to some\nperson of quality, residing in the place whither he\nremoveth; that he may use his favor, in those\nthings he desireth to see or know.  Thus he may\nabridge his travel, with much profit.  As for the\nacquaintance, which is to be sought in travel; that\nwhich is most of all profitable, is acquaintance\nwith the secretaries and employed men of ambassadors: for so in travelling in one country, he shall\nsuck the experience of many.  Let him also see, and\nvisit, eminent persons in all kinds, which are of\ngreat name abroad; that he may be able to tell,\nhow the life agreeth with the fame.  For quarrels,\nthey are with care and discretion to be avoided.\nThey are commonly for mistresses, healths, place,\nand words.  And let a man beware,  how he keepeth\ncompany with choleric and quarrelsome persons;\nfor they will engage him into their own quarrels.\nWhen a traveller returneth home, let him not\nleave the countries, where he hath travelled, altogether behind him; but maintain a correspondence by letters, with those of his acquaintance,\nwhich are of most worth.  And let his travel appear\nrather in his discourse, than his apparel or gesture;\nand in his discourse, let him be rather advised in\nhis answers, than forward to tell stories; and let it\nappear that he doth not change his country manners, for those of foreign parts; but only prick in\nsome flowers, of that he hath learned abroad, into\nthe customs of his own country.",
