        "“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and\nthere they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of\ngold-fish she had accidentally upset the week before.",
        "“Oh, I beg your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay,\nand began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the\naccident of the gold-fish kept running in her head, and she had a\nvague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back\ninto the jury-box, or they would die.",
        "“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King, in a very grave voice,\n“until all the jurymen are back in their proper places—all,” he\nrepeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.",
        "Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\nthe Lizard in head downward, and the poor little thing was waving its\ntail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.",
        "She soon got it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies\nmuch,” she said to herself; “I should think it would be quite as\nmuch use in the trial one way up as the other.”",
        "As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\ncourt.",
        "“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.",
        "“Nothing,” said Alice.",
        "“Nothing whatever?” persisted the King.",
        "“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.",
        "“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\nRabbit interrupted: “Unimportant, your Majesty means, of course,” he\nsaid, in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him\nas he spoke.",
        "“Unimportant, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on\nto himself in an undertone, “important—unimportant—unimportant—important—\"\nas if he were trying which word sounded best.",
        "Some of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”",
        "Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their\nslates; “but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.",
        "At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\nhis note-book, called out, “Silence!” and read out from his book,\n“Rule Forty-two. All persons more than a mile high to leave the\ncourt.”",
        "Everybody looked at Alice.",
        "“I’m not a mile high,” said Alice.",
        "“You are,” said the King.",
        "“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.",
        "“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a\nregular rule: you invented it just now.”",
        "“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.",
        "“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.",
        "The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.",
        "“Consider your verdict,” he said to the jury, in a low trembling\nvoice.",
        "“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the\nWhite Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry: “this paper has just been\npicked up.”",
        "“What’s in it?” said the Queen.",
        "“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit; “but it seems to be\na letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”",
        "“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to\nnobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”",
        "“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.",
        "“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit: “in fact, there’s\nnothing written on the outside.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,\nand added, “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”",
        "“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the\njurymen.",
        "“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest\nthing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)",
        "“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury\nall brightened up again.)",
        "“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they\ncan’t prove that I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”",
        "“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter\nworse. You must have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed\nyour name like an honest man.”",
        "There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\nclever thing the King had said that day.",
        "“That proves his guilt, of course,” said the Queen: “so, off with—”",
        "“It doesn’t prove anything of the sort!” said Alice. “Why, you don’t\neven know what they’re about!”",
        "“Read them,” said the King.",
        "The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please\nyour Majesty?” he asked.",
        "“Begin at the beginning,” the King said very gravely, “and go on till\nyou come to the end: then stop.”",
        "There was dead silence in the court, while the White Rabbit read out\nthese verses:",
        "“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said\nthe King, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”",
        "“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice (she had grown so\nlarge in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of\ninterrupting him), “I’ll give him sixpence. I don’t believe there’s\nan atom of meaning in it.”",
        "The jury all wrote down, on their slates, “She doesn’t believe\nthere’s an atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to\nexplain the paper.",
        "“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of\ntrouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t\nknow,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking\nat them with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\n’—said I could not swim—’ you can’t swim, can you?” he added,\nturning to the Knave.",
        "The Knave shook his head sadly.",
        "“Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he certainly did not, being\nmade entirely of cardboard.)",
        "“All right, so far,” said the King; and he went on muttering over the\nverses to himself: “’We know it to be true’—that’s the jury,\nof course—’If she should push the matter on’—that must be the\nQueen—’What would become of you?’—What indeed!—’I gave\nher one, they gave him two’—why, that must be what he did with\nthe tarts, you know—”",
        "“But it goes on ’they all returned from him to you,’” said\nAlice.",
        "“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\ntarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than that. Then\nagain—’before she had this fit’—you never had fits, my dear,\nI think?” he said to the Queen.",
        "“Never!” said the Queen, furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\nas it lasted.)",
        "“Then the words don’t fit you,” said the King; looking round\nthe court with a smile. There was a dead silence.",
        "“It’s a pun!” the King added in an angry tone, and everybody laughed.\n“Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for about the\ntwentieth time that day.",
        "“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterward.”",
        "“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the\nsentence first!”",
        "“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.",
        "“I won’t!” said Alice.",
        "“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\nmoved.",
        "“Who cares for you?” said Alice (she had grown to her full size by\nthis time). “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”",
        "At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\nher; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.",
        "“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister. “Why, what a long sleep you’ve\nhad!”",
        "“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice. And she told her\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\nadventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and, when\nshe had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It was a curious\ndream, dear, certainly; but now run in to your tea: it’s getting late.”",
        "So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she\nmight, what a wonderful dream it had been.",
        "But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\nher wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\nand this was her dream:",
        "First, she dreamed about little Alice herself: once again the tiny\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\nlooking into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see\nthat queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\nthat would always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\nstrange creatures of her little sister’s dream.",
        "The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighboring pool—she\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the\npig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess’ knee, while plates and dishes\ncrashed around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking\nof the Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed\nguinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sob of the\nmiserable Mock Turtle.",
        "So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\nwould change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep bells, and the Queen’s shrill\ncries to the voice of the shepherd-boy—and the sneeze of the baby,\nthe shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would\nchange (she knew) to the confused clamor of the busy farm-yard—while\nthe lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the\nMock Turtle’s heavy sobs.",
        "Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\nchildhood; and how she would gather about her other little children,\nand make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago; and how she\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy\nsummer days.",
