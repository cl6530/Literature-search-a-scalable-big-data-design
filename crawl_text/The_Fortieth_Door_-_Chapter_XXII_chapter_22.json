        "FROM THE BAZAARS",
        "There was a moment’s pause.",
        "“What? That lovely girl?” said Jinny in startled pity. She added\nincredulously, “Yesterday?... And only the day before–why, what\ncould have happened?”",
        "That was what McLean was asking himself very grimly.",
        "Aloud he told her slowly. “They say that fire happened. Some\naccident–a candle overturned in her apartments. And of course the\nwindows were screened–”",
        "“_Fire–how terrible! That lovely girl,” said Jinny again. She was\ngenuinely horrified and pitiful, yet she found a moment to wonder at\nthe evident depths of McLean’s consternation. For of course he had\nnever seen the girl.",
        "Yet he looked utterly upset.",
        "“It’s one of the most dreadful things I ever heard of,” Jinny\nmurmured. “On her wedding night.... And she was so young, Mr.\nMcLean, and so exquisite. She didn’t look like a real girl.... She\nwas a fairy creature.... I never dreamed there really were\nrose-leaf skins before but hers was just like flower petals. Jack\nand I talked about it, I remember. And her face had something so\nbewitching about it, something so sweet and delicate–”",
        "She broke off revisited with that vision of Aimée’s sprite-like\nbeauty.... How little that poor girl had thought, as she stood there\nin the bright splendor of her robes and diadem, that in a few hours\nmore–",
        "“Oh, I hope that fire–that it was merciful–that she didn’t\nsuffer,” she said almost inaudibly.",
        "But speech itself was too definitive of horrors.",
        "“It’s tragic,” she finished simply.",
        "It was tragic, with a complicated tragedy, thought Andrew McLean as\nhe stood there, his eyes narrowing, his lips compressed, his mind\ninvaded with a dark swarm of conjecture, surmise, suspicion, his\nvision possessed by a flitting rush of pictures.",
        "He saw Jack talking with the girl at the reception.... The girl\nshowing him something about her neck–that accursed locket, he\nthought acutely.... Jack sending Miss Jeffries home.... Had he\narranged that purposely? Was there some mad, improvised scheme of\nescape in the air?",
        "The pictures became mere flitting wraiths of conjecture, yet touched\nwith horrifying possibility.... Jack lingering, hiding.... Jack\nmaking love to the girl, attempting flight.... Jack discovered–and\nthe quick saber thrust–for both.",
        "A fire?... Very likely–to screen the darker tragedy. Hamdi was\ncapable of it to save his pride. And it would dispose so easily of\nthe–evidence.",
        "McLean’s thoughts flinched from the grim outcome of his fear. He\ntried to tell himself that he was inventing horrors, that the fire\nmight be the simple truth, that Ryder’s talk with the girl might\nactually have ended in farewell–at least a temporary farewell–and\nthat his consequent low spirits had taken him off to mope in camp.",
        "That was undoubtedly the thing to believe, at least until there was\nactual necessity to disbelieve it, and looking at the story in that\nway, McLean’s Scotch sense of Providence was capable of pointing out\nthe stern benefits of the sad visitation.",
        "Whatever mischief might have been afoot between his friend and that\nunfortunate young girl the fire had prevented. And however hard Jack\nmight take this now, decidedly the poor girl’s death was better for\nhim than her life.",
        "No more wasting himself now on sad romance and adventure. No more\ndesire and danger. No more lurking about barred gates and secret\ndoors and forbidden palaces. No more clandestine trysts. No more\nfury of mind, beating against the bars of fate.",
        "Jack was saved.",
        "Even if he had succeeded in rescuing the girl–what then? McLean was\nskeptical of felicity from such contrasting lives. Better the\nfinality, the sharp pain, the utter separation. And then–",
        "His eyes returned to the young American before him. She was the\nunconscious answer to that future. She would save Ryder from regret\nand retrospection.... In after years, looking back from a happy and\nwell-ordered domesticity, this would all become to him a fantastic,\nfar-off adventure, sad with the remembered but unfelt sadness of\nyouth, yet mercifully dim and softened with young beauty.",
        "Jack must never tell this girl the story. McLean had read somewhere\nof the mistakes of too-open revelation to women and now he was very\nsure of it.... She must never receive this hurt, never know that\nwhen she had been troubling over Jack’s disappearance he had been\nagonizing over another girl–that the escapade she thought so\nintimate a lark had been a trick to see the other–that the young\ncreature whose loveliness she so innocently praised had been her\nrival, drawing Jack from her....",
        "McLean would speak clearly to Ryder about this and seal his lips....\nBut first he would have to be found.",
        "He became conscious that he had been a long time silent, following\nthese thoughts, while Jinny waited.",
        "“I’ll do everything I can to find out about that fire,” he told her.\n“I mean, about any discovery of Jack in the palace,” he quickly\namended as her face was touched with instant question. “And I’ll see\nif any one in Cairo knows where he is. Then if nothing turns up I’ll\njust pop out to his diggings in the morning and make sure he’s all\nright.... I’ll get back that night and telephone you. And until\nthen, not a word about it. Much better not.”",
        "“Not a word,” Jinny promised. “And if you should happen to find out\nanything to-night–”",
        "“I’ll let you know at once. Well, rather. But don’t count on that.\nThe old boy is out in his tombs, dusting off his mummies. You may\nget a letter, yourself, in the morning,” he threw out with\nheartening inspiration, “And while you are reading it, I’ll be\ntearing along to the infernal desert–”",
        "He had brought the smile to her eyes as well as lips. Bright and\nreassured and comfortably dependent upon his resourceful strength,\nshe took her leave.",
        "But there was no smile remaining upon Andrew McLean’s visage.",
        "Twenty-four hours. Two nights and a day.... And the girl was dead\nand in her grave–Moslems wasted no time before interment–and Jack\nwas–where?",
