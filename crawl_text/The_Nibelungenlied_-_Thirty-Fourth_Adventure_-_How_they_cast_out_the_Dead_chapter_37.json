        "From toil of battle weary / rested the warriors all.\nVolker and Hagen / passed out before the hall,\nAnd on their shields did lean them, / those knights whom naught\n      could daunt.\nThen with full merry converse / gan the twain their foes to taunt.",
        "2010",
        "Spake meanwhile of Burgundy / Giselher the thane:\n“Not yet, good friends, may ye / think to rest again.\nForth from the hall the corses / shall ye rather bear.\nAgain we’ll be assailed, / that would I now in sooth declare.",
        "2011",
        "“Beneath our feet no longer / here the dead must lie.\nBut ere in storm of battle / at hand of Huns to die,\nWe’ll deal such wounds around us / as ’tis my joy to see.\nThereon,” spake Giselher, / “my heart is fixed right steadfastly.”",
        "2012",
        "“I joy in such a master,\" / Hagen spake again:\n“Such counsel well befitteth / alone so valiant thane\nAs my youthful master / hath shown himself this day.\nTherefor, O men of Burgundy, / every one rejoice ye may.”",
        "2013",
        "Then followed they his counsel / and from the hall they bore\nSeven thousand bodies / and cast them from the door.\nAdown the mounting stairway / all together fell,\nWhereat a sound of wailing / did from mourning kinsmen swell.",
        "2014",
        "Many a man among them / so slight wound did bear\nThat he were yet recovered / had he but gentle care,\nWho yet falling headlong / now surely must be dead.\nThereat did grieve their kinsmen / as verily was sorest need.",
        "2015",
        "Then outspake the Fiddler, / Volker a hero bold:\n“Now do I find how truly / hath to me been told\nThat cowards are the Hun-men / who do like women weep.\nRather should be their effort / their wounded kin alive to keep.”",
        "2016",
        "These words deemed a margrave / spoken in kindly mood.\nHe saw one of his kinsmen / weltering in his blood.\nIn his arms he clasped him / and thought him thence to bear,\nBut as he bent above him / pierced him the valiant minstrel’s spear.",
        "2017",
        "When that beheld the others / all in haste they fled,\nCrying each one curses / on that same minstrel’s head.\nFrom the ground then snatched he / a spear with point full keen,\nThat ’gainst him up the stairway / by a Hun had hurled been.",
        "2018",
        "Across the court he flung it / with his arm of might\nFar above the people. / Then did each Hunnish knight\nSeek him safer quarters / more distant from the hall.\nTo see his mighty prowess / did fill with fear his foemen all.",
        "2019",
        "As knights full many thousand / far ’fore the palace stood,\nVolker and Hagen / gan speak in wanton mood\n“Unto King Etzel, / nor did they aught withhold;\nWherefrom anon did sorrow / o’ertake those doughty warriors bold.",
        "2020",
        "“’Twould well beseem,” quoth Hagen, / “the people’s lofty lord\nForemost in storm of battle / to swing the cutting sword,\nAs do my royal masters / each fair example show.\nWhere hew they through the helmets / their swords do make the blood to\n      flow.”",
        "2021",
        "To hear such words brave Etzel / snatched in haste his shield.\n“Now well beware of rashness,\" / cried Lady Kriemhild,\n“And offer to thy warriors / gold heaped on shield full high:\nIf yonder Hagen reach thee, / straightway shalt thou surely die.”",
        "2022",
        "So high was the king’s mettle / that he would not give o’er,\nWhich case is now full seldom / seen in high princes more;\nThey must by shield-strap tugging / him perforce restrain.\nGrim of mood then Hagen / began him to revile again.",
        "2023",
        "“It was a distant kinship,\" / spake Hagen, dauntless knight,\n“That Etzel unto Siegfried / ever did unite,\nAnd husband he to Kriemhild / was ere thee she knew.\nWherefore, O king faint-hearted, / seek’st thou such thing ’gainst me to\n      do?”",
        "2024",
        "Thereto eke must listen / the noble monarch’s spouse,\nAnd grievously to hear it / did Kriemhild’s wrath arouse.\nThat he ’fore men of Etzel / durst herself upbraid;\nTo urge them ’gainst the strangers / she once more her arts essayed.",
        "2025",
        "Cried she: “Of Tronje Hagen / whoso for me will slay,\nAnd his head from body severed / here before me lay,\nFor him the shield of Etzel / I’ll fill with ruddy gold,\nEke lands and lordly castles / I’ll give him for his own to hold.”",
        "2026",
        "“I wot not why they tarry,\" / –thus the minstrel cried;\n“Ne’er saw I heroes any / so their courage hide,\nWhen to them was offered, / like this, reward so high.\n’Tis cause henceforth that Etzel / for aye to them goodwill deny.”",
        "2027",
        "“Who in such craven manner / do eat their master’s bread,\nAnd like caitiffs fail him / in time of greatest need,\nHere see I standing many / of courage all forlorn,\nYet would be men of valor; / all time be they upheld to scorn.”",
