        "\nI had been certain the day before that I should be the first to arrive.  But it\nwas not a question of being the first to arrive.  Not only were they not\nthere, but I had difficulty in finding our room.  The table was not laid\neven.  What did it mean?  After a good many questions I elicited from the\nwaiters that the dinner had been ordered not for five, but for six o’clock.\nThis was confirmed at the buffet too.  I felt really ashamed to go on\nquestioning them.  It was only twenty-five minutes past five.  If they\nchanged the dinner hour they ought at least to have let me know—that is\nwhat the post is for, and not to have put me in an absurd position in my\nown eyes and ... and even before the waiters.  I sat down; the servant\nbegan laying the table; I felt even more humiliated when he was present. \nTowards six o’clock they brought in candles, though there were lamps\nburning in the room.  It had not occurred to the waiter, however, to bring\nthem in at once when I arrived.  In the next room two gloomy, angry-\nlooking persons were eating their dinners in silence at two different\ntables.  There was a great deal of noise, even shouting, in a room further\naway; one could hear the laughter of a crowd of people, and nasty little\nshrieks in French: there were ladies at the dinner.  It was sickening, in fact. \nI rarely passed more unpleasant moments, so much so that when they did\narrive all together punctually at six I was overjoyed to see them, as though\nthey were my deliverers, and even forgot that it was incumbent upon me\nto show resentment.",
        "Zverkov walked in at the head of them; evidently he was the leading\nspirit.  He and all of them were laughing; but, seeing me, Zverkov drew\nhimself up a little, walked up to me deliberately with a slight, rather jaunty\nbend from the waist.  He shook hands with me in a friendly, but not over-\nfriendly, fashion, with a sort of circumspect courtesy like that of a General,\nas though in giving me his hand he were warding off something.  I had\nimagined, on the contrary, that on coming in he would at once break into\nhis habitual thin, shrill laugh and fall to making his insipid jokes and\nwitticisms.  I had been preparing for them ever since the previous day, but I\nhad not expected such condescension, such high-official courtesy.  So,\nthen, he felt himself ineffably superior to me in every respect!  If he only\nmeant to insult me by that high-official tone, it would not matter, I\nthought—I could pay him back for it one way or another.  But what if, in\nreality, without the least desire to be offensive, that sheepshead had a\nnotion in earnest that he was superior to me and could only look at me in a\npatronising way?  The very supposition made me gasp.",
        "“I was surprised to hear of your desire to join us,” he began, lisping and\ndrawling, which was something new.  “You and I seem to have seen nothing of one\nanother.  You fight shy of us.  You shouldn’t.  We are not such terrible\npeople as you think.  Well, anyway, I am glad to renew our acquaintance.”",
        "And he turned carelessly to put down his hat on the window.",
        "“Have you been waiting long?” Trudolyubov inquired.",
        "“I arrived at five o’clock as you told me yesterday,” I answered aloud,\nwith an irritability that threatened an explosion.",
        "“Didn’t you let him know that we had changed the hour?” said\nTrudolyubov to Simonov.",
        "“No, I didn’t.  I forgot,” the latter replied, with no sign of regret,\nand without even apologising to me he went off to order the HORS D’OEUVRE.",
        "“So you’ve been here a whole hour?  Oh, poor fellow!” Zverkov cried\nironically, for to his notions this was bound to be extremely funny.  That\nrascal Ferfitchkin followed with his nasty little snigger like a puppy yapping.\nMy position struck him, too, as exquisitely ludicrous and embarrassing.",
        "“It isn’t funny at all!” I cried to Ferfitchkin, more and more irritated. \n“It wasn’t my fault, but other people’s.  They neglected to let me know.  It\nwas ... it was ... it was simply absurd.”",
        "“It’s not only absurd, but something else as well,” muttered Trudolyubov,\nnaively taking my part.  “You are not hard enough upon it.  It was\nsimply rudeness—unintentional, of course.  And how could Simonov ... h’m!”",
        "“If a trick like that had been played on me,” observed Ferfitchkin, “I\nshould ...”",
        "“But you should have ordered something for yourself,” Zverkov interrupted,\n“or simply asked for dinner without waiting for us.”",
        "“You will allow that I might have done that without your permission,\"\nI rapped out.  “If I waited, it was ...”",
        "“Let us sit down, gentlemen,” cried Simonov, coming in.  “Everything\nis ready; I can answer for the champagne; it is capitally frozen ....  You\nsee, I did not know your address, where was I to look for you?” he\nsuddenly turned to me, but again he seemed to avoid looking at me. \nEvidently he had something against me.  It must have been what\nhappened yesterday.",
        "All sat down; I did the same.  It was a round table.  Trudolyubov was on\nmy left, Simonov on my right, Zverkov was sitting opposite, Ferfitchkin\nnext to him, between him and Trudolyubov.",
        "“Tell me, are you ... in a government office?” Zverkov went on\nattending to me.  Seeing that I was embarrassed he seriously thought that\nhe ought to be friendly to me, and, so to speak, cheer me up.",
        "“Does he want me to throw a bottle at his head?” I thought, in a fury. \nIn my novel surroundings I was unnaturally ready to be irritated.",
        "“In the N—-xxxxxxxxxxxxx office,” I answered jerkily, with my eyes on my plate.",
        "“And ha-ave you a go-od berth?  I say, what ma-a-de you leave your\noriginal job?”",
        "“What ma-a-de me was that I wanted to leave my original job,” I\ndrawled more than he, hardly able to control myself.  Ferfitchkin went off\ninto a guffaw.  Simonov looked at me ironically.  Trudolyubov left off\neating and began looking at me with curiosity.",
        "Zverkov winced, but he tried not to notice it. ",
        "“And the remuneration?”",
        "“What remuneration?”",
        "“I mean, your sa-a-lary?”",
        "“Why are you cross-examining me?” However, I told him at once what\nmy salary was.  I turned horribly red.",
        "“It is not very handsome,” Zverkov observed majestically.",
        "“Yes, you can’t afford to dine at cafes on that,” Ferfitchkin\nadded insolently.",
        "“To my thinking it’s very poor,” Trudolyubov observed gravely.",
        "“And how thin you have grown!  How you have changed!” added\nZverkov, with a shade of venom in his voice, scanning me and my attire\nwith a sort of insolent compassion.",
        "“Oh, spare his blushes,” cried Ferfitchkin, sniggering.",
        "“My dear sir, allow me to tell you I am not blushing,” I broke out at\nlast; “do you hear?  I am dining here, at this cafe, at my own expense, not\nat other people’s—note that, Mr. Ferfitchkin.”",
        "“Wha-at?  Isn’t every one here dining at his own expense?  You would\nseem to be ...”  Ferfitchkin flew out at me, turning as red as a lobster,\nand looking me in the face with fury.\n“Tha-at,” I answered, feeling I had gone too far, “and I imagine it\nwould be better to talk of something more intelligent.”",
        "“You intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?”",
        "“Don’t disturb yourself, that would be quite out of place here.”",
        "“Why are you clacking away like that, my good sir, eh?  Have you gone\nout of your wits in your office?”",
        "“Enough, gentlemen, enough!” Zverkov cried, authoritatively.",
        "“How stupid it is!” muttered Simonov.",
        "“It really is stupid.  We have met here, a company of friends, for a\nfarewell dinner to a comrade and you carry on an altercation,” said\nTrudolyubov, rudely addressing himself to me alone.  “You invited yourself\nto join us, so don’t disturb the general harmony.”",
        "“Enough, enough!” cried Zverkov.  “Give over, gentlemen, it’s out of\nplace.  Better let me tell you how I nearly got married the day before\nyesterday ....”",
        "And then followed a burlesque narrative of how this gentleman had\nalmost been married two days before.  There was not a word about the\nmarriage, however, but the story was adorned with generals, colonels and\nkammer-junkers, while Zverkov almost took the lead among them.  It was\ngreeted with approving laughter; Ferfitchkin positively squealed.",
        "No one paid any attention to me, and I sat crushed and humiliated.",
        "“Good Heavens, these are not the people for me!” I thought.  “And\nwhat a fool I have made of myself before them!  I let Ferfitchkin go too far,\nthough.  The brutes imagine they are doing me an honour in letting me\nsit down with them.  They don’t understand that it’s an honour to them\nand not to me!  I’ve grown thinner!  My clothes!  Oh, damn my trousers!\nZverkov noticed the yellow stain on the knee as soon as he came in ....\nBut what’s the use!  I must get up at once, this very minute, take my hat\nand simply go without a word ... with contempt!  And tomorrow I can\nsend a challenge.  The scoundrels!  As though I cared about the seven\nroubles.  They may think ....  Damn it!  I don’t care about the seven\nroubles.  I’ll go this minute!”",
        "Of course I remained.  I drank sherry and Lafitte by the glassful in my\ndiscomfiture.  Being unaccustomed to it, I was quickly affected.  My\nannoyance increased as the wine went to my head.  I longed all at once to\ninsult them all in a most flagrant manner and then go away.  To seize the\nmoment and show what I could do, so that they would say, “He’s clever,\nthough he is absurd,” and ... and ... in fact, damn them all!",
        "I scanned them all insolently with my drowsy eyes.  But they seemed to\nhave forgotten me altogether.  They were noisy, vociferous, cheerful. \nZverkov was talking all the time.  I began listening.  Zverkov was talking of\nsome exuberant lady whom he had at last led on to declaring her love (of\ncourse, he was lying like a horse), and how he had been helped in this\naffair by an intimate friend of his, a Prince Kolya, an officer in the\nhussars, who had three thousand serfs.",
        "“And yet this Kolya, who has three thousand serfs, has not put in an\nappearance here tonight to see you off,” I cut in suddenly.",
        "For one minute every one was silent.  “You are drunk already.\"\nTrudolyubov deigned to notice me at last, glancing contemptuously in my\ndirection.  Zverkov, without a word, examined me as though I were an insect.\nI dropped my eyes.  Simonov made haste to fill up the glasses with champagne.",
        "Trudolyubov raised his glass, as did everyone else but me.",
        "“Your health and good luck on the journey!” he cried to Zverkov.  “To\nold times, to our future, hurrah!”",
        "They all tossed off their glasses, and crowded round Zverkov to kiss\nhim.  I did not move; my full glass stood untouched before me.",
        "“Why, aren’t you going to drink it?” roared Trudolyubov, losing patience\nand turning menacingly to me.",
        "“I want to make a speech separately, on my own account ... and then\nI’ll drink it, Mr. Trudolyubov.”",
        "“Spiteful brute!” muttered Simonov.  I drew myself up in my chair and\nfeverishly seized my glass, prepared for something extraordinary, though\nI did not know myself precisely what I was going to say.",
        "“SILENCE!” cried Ferfitchkin.  “Now for a display of wit!”",
        "Zverkov waited very gravely, knowing what was coming.",
        "“Mr. Lieutenant Zverkov,” I began, “let me tell you that I hate\nphrases, phrasemongers and men in corsets ... that’s the first point, and\nthere is a second one to follow it.”",
        "There was a general stir.",
        "“The second point is: I hate ribaldry and ribald talkers.  Especially\nribald talkers!  The third point: I love justice, truth and honesty.”  I went\non almost mechanically, for I was beginning to shiver with horror myself\nand had no idea how I came to be talking like this.  “I love thought,\nMonsieur Zverkov; I love true comradeship, on an equal footing and\nnot ... H’m ... I love ... But, however, why not?  I will drink your\nhealth, too, Mr. Zverkov.  Seduce the Circassian girls, shoot the enemies\nof the fatherland and ... and ... to your health, Monsieur Zverkov!”",
        "Zverkov got up from his seat, bowed to me and said:",
        "“I am very much obliged to you.”  He was frightfully offended and\nturned pale.",
        "“Damn the fellow!” roared Trudolyubov, bringing his fist down on\nthe table.",
        "“Well, he wants a punch in the face for that,” squealed Ferfitchkin.",
        "“We ought to turn him out,” muttered Simonov.",
        "“Not a word, gentlemen, not a movement!” cried Zverkov solemnly,\nchecking the general indignation.  “I thank you all, but I can show him\nfor myself how much value I attach to his words.”",
        "“Mr.  Ferfitchkin, you will give me satisfaction tomorrow for your\nwords just now!” I said aloud, turning with dignity to Ferfitchkin.",
        "“A duel, you mean?  Certainly,” he answered.  But probably I was\nso ridiculous as I challenged him and it was so out of keeping with\nmy appearance that everyone including Ferfitchkin was prostrate with laughter.",
        "“Yes, let him alone, of course!  He is quite drunk,” Trudolyubov said\nwith disgust.",
        "“I shall never forgive myself for letting him join us,” Simonov\nmuttered again.",
        "“Now is the time to throw a bottle at their heads,” I thought to myself.\nI picked up the bottle ... and filled my glass ....  “No, I’d better sit\non to the end,” I went on thinking; “you would be pleased, my friends, if I\nwent away.  Nothing will induce me to go.  I’ll go on sitting here and\ndrinking to the end, on purpose, as a sign that I don’t think you of the\nslightest consequence.  I will go on sitting and drinking, because this is a\npublic-house and I paid my entrance money.  I’ll sit here and drink, for I\nlook upon you as so many pawns, as inanimate pawns.  I’ll sit here and\ndrink ... and sing if I want to, yes, sing, for I have the right to ... to\nsing ...  H’m!”",
        "But I did not sing.  I simply tried not to look at any of them.  I assumed\nmost unconcerned attitudes and waited with impatience for them to\nspeak FIRST.  But alas, they did not address me!  And oh, how I wished, how\nI wished at that moment to be reconciled to them!  It struck eight, at last\nnine.  They moved from the table to the sofa.  Zverkov stretched himself\non a lounge and put one foot on a round table.  Wine was brought there. \nHe did, as a fact, order three bottles on his own account.  I, of course, was\nnot invited to join them.  They all sat round him on the sofa.  They\nlistened to him, almost with reverence.  It was evident that they were fond\nof him.  “What for?  What for?” I wondered.  From time to time they were\nmoved to drunken enthusiasm and kissed each other.  They talked of the\nCaucasus, of the nature of true passion, of snug berths in the service, of\nthe income of an hussar called Podharzhevsky, whom none of them knew\npersonally, and rejoiced in the largeness of it, of the extraordinary grace\nand beauty of a Princess D., whom none of them had ever seen; then it\ncame to Shakespeare’s being immortal.",
        "I smiled contemptuously and walked up and down the other side of the\nroom, opposite the sofa, from the table to the stove and back again.  I tried\nmy very utmost to show them that I could do without them, and yet I\npurposely made a noise with my boots, thumping with my heels.  But it\nwas all in vain.  They paid no attention.  I had the patience to walk up and\ndown in front of them from eight o’clock till eleven, in the same place,\nfrom the table to the stove and back again.  “I walk up and down to please\nmyself and no one can prevent me.”  The waiter who came into the room\nstopped, from time to time, to look at me.  I was somewhat giddy from\nturning round so often; at moments it seemed to me that I was in\ndelirium.  During those three hours I was three times soaked with sweat\nand dry again.  At times, with an intense, acute pang I was stabbed to the\nheart by the thought that ten years, twenty years, forty years would pass,\nand that even in forty years I would remember with loathing and humiliation\nthose filthiest, most ludicrous, and most awful moments of my life. \nNo one could have gone out of his way to degrade himself more shamelessly,\nand I fully realised it, fully, and yet I went on pacing up and down\nfrom the table to the stove.  “Oh, if you only knew what thoughts and\nfeelings I am capable of, how cultured I am!” I thought at moments,\nmentally addressing the sofa on which my enemies were sitting.  But my\nenemies behaved as though I were not in the room.  Once—only once—\nthey turned towards me, just when Zverkov was talking about Shakespeare,\nand I suddenly gave a contemptuous laugh.  I laughed in such an\naffected and disgusting way that they all at once broke off their conversation,\nand silently and gravely for two minutes watched me walking up and\ndown from the table to the stove, TAKING NO NOTICE OF THEM.  But nothing\ncame of it: they said nothing, and two minutes later they ceased to notice\nme again.  It struck eleven.",
        "“Friends,” cried Zverkov getting up from the sofa, “let us all be off\nnow, THERE!”",
        "“Of course, of course,” the others assented.  I turned sharply to\nZverkov.  I was so harassed, so exhausted, that I would have cut my throat\nto put an end to it.  I was in a fever; my hair, soaked with perspiration,\nstuck to my forehead and temples.",
        "“Zverkov, I beg your pardon,” I said abruptly and resolutely.\n“Ferfitchkin, yours too, and everyone’s, everyone’s: I have insulted you all!”",
        "“Aha!  A duel is not in your line, old man,” Ferfitchkin\nhissed venomously.",
        "It sent a sharp pang to my heart.",
        "“No, it’s not the duel I am afraid of, Ferfitchkin!  I am ready to fight\nyou tomorrow, after we are reconciled.  I insist upon it, in fact, and you\ncannot refuse.  I want to show you that I am not afraid of a duel.  You shall\nfire first and I shall fire into the air.”",
        "“He is comforting himself,” said Simonov.",
        "“He’s simply raving,” said Trudolyubov.",
        "“But let us pass.  Why are you barring our way?  What do you want?\"\nZverkov answered disdainfully.\nThey were all flushed, their eyes were bright: they had been\ndrinking heavily.",
        "“I ask for your friendship, Zverkov; I insulted you, but ...”",
        "“Insulted?  YOU insulted ME?  Understand, sir, that you never, under any\ncircumstances, could possibly insult ME.”",
        "“And that’s enough for you.  Out of the way!” concluded Trudolyubov.",
        "“Olympia is mine, friends, that’s agreed!” cried Zverkov.",
        "“We won’t dispute your right, we won’t dispute your right,” the others\nanswered, laughing.",
        "I stood as though spat upon.  The party went noisily out of the room. \nTrudolyubov struck up some stupid song.  Simonov remained behind for\na moment to tip the waiters.  I suddenly went up to him.",
        "“Simonov!  give me six roubles!” I said, with desperate resolution.",
        "He looked at me in extreme amazement, with vacant eyes.   He, too,\nwas drunk.",
        "“You don’t mean you are coming with us?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“I’ve no money,” he snapped out, and with a scornful laugh he went\nout of the room.",
        "I clutched at his overcoat.  It was a nightmare.",
        "“Simonov, I saw you had money.  Why do you refuse me?  Am I a\nscoundrel?  Beware of refusing me: if you knew, if you knew why I am\nasking!  My whole future, my whole plans depend upon it!”",
        "Simonov pulled out the money and almost flung it at me.",
        "“Take it, if you have no sense of shame!” he pronounced pitilessly, and\nran to overtake them.",
        "I was left for a moment alone.  Disorder, the remains of dinner, a\nbroken wine-glass on the floor, spilt wine, cigarette ends, fumes of drink\nand delirium in my brain, an agonising misery in my heart and finally\nthe waiter, who had seen and heard all and was looking inquisitively into\nmy face.",
        "“I am going there!” I cried.  “Either they shall all go down on their\nknees to beg for my friendship, or I will give Zverkov a slap in the face!”",
