        "I am free, I am a friend of God, ready to render Him willing\nobedience. Of all else I may set store by nothing—neither by\nmine own body, nor possessions, nor office, nor good report, nor,\nin a word, aught else beside. For it is not His Will, that I\nshould so set store by these things. Had it been His pleasure, He\nwould have placed my Good therein. But now He hath not done so:\ntherefore I cannot transgress one jot of His commands. In\neverything hold fast to that which is thy Good—but to all else\n(as far as is given thee) within the measure of Reason only,\ncontented with this alone. Else thou wilt meet with failure, ill\nsuccess, let and hindrance. These are the Laws ordained of God—\nthese are His Edicts; these a man should expound and interpret;\nto these submit himself, not to the laws of Masurius and\nCassius.(16)",
