        "No literary labor is more delightful to me than translating the\nbeautiful thoughts and fancies of Hans Christian Andersen. My heart is\nin the work, and I feel as if my spirit were kindred to his; just as\nour Saxon English seems to me eminently fitted to give the simple,\npure, and noble sentiments of the Danish mind.",
        "This True Story of his Life will not be found the least interesting of\nhis writings; indeed, to me it seems one of the most so. It furnishes\nthe key, as it were, to all the rest; and the treasures which it\nunlocks will be found to be possessed of additional value when viewed\nthrough the medium of this introduction. It is gratifying for me to be\nable to state that the original Author has a personal interest in this\nEnglish version of his “Life,” as I have arranged with my publishers to\npay Mr. Andersen a certain sum on the publication of this translation,\nand the same on all future editions.",

        "My life is a lovely story, happy and full of incident. If, when I was a\nboy, and went forth into the world poor and friendless, a good fairy\nhad met me and said, “Choose now thy own course through life, and the\nobject for which thou wilt strive, and then, according to the\ndevelopment of thy mind, and as reason requires, I will guide and\ndefend thee to its attainment,” my fate could not, even then, have been\ndirected more happily, more prudently, or better. The history of my\nlife will say to the world what it says to me–There is a loving God,\nwho directs all things for the best.",
        "My native land, Denmark, is a poetical land, full of popular\ntraditions, old songs, and an eventful history, which has become bound\nup with that of Sweden and Norway. The Danish islands are possessed of\nbeautiful beech woods, and corn and clover fields: they resemble\ngardens on a great scale. Upon one of these green islands, Funen,\nstands Odense, the place of my birth. Odense is called after the pagan\ngod Odin, who, as tradition states, lived here: this place is the\ncapital of the province, and lies twenty-two Danish miles from\nCopenhagen.",
        "In the year 1805 there lived here, in a small mean room, a young\nmarried couple, who were extremely attached to each other; he was a\nshoemaker, scarcely twenty-two years old, a man of a richly gifted and\ntruly poetical mind. His wife, a few years older than himself, was\nignorant of life and of the world, but possessed a heart full of love.\nThe young man had himself made his shoemaking bench, and the bedstead\nwith which he began housekeeping; this bedstead he had made out of the\nwooden frame which had borne only a short time before the coffin of the\ndeceased Count Trampe, as he lay in state, and the remnants of the\nblack cloth on the wood work kept the fact still in remembrance.",
        "Instead of a noble corpse, surrounded by crape and wax-lights, here\nlay, on the second of April, 1805, a living and weeping child,–that\nwas myself, Hans Christian Andersen. During the first day of my\nexistence my father is said to have sate by the bed and read aloud in\nHolberg, but I cried all the time. “Wilt thou go to sleep, or listen\nquietly?” it is reported that my father asked in joke; but I still\ncried on; and even in the church, when I was taken to be baptized, I\ncried so loudly that the preacher, who was a passionate man, said, “The\nyoung one screams like a cat!” which words my mother never forgot. A\npoor emigrant, Gomar, who stood as godfather, consoled her in the mean\ntime by saying that the louder I cried as a child, all the more\nbeautifully should I sing when I grew older.",
        "Our little room, which was almost filled with the shoemaker’s bench,\nthe bed, and my crib, was the abode of my childhood; the walls,\nhowever, were covered with pictures, and over the work-bench was a\ncupboard containing books and songs; the little kitchen was full of\nshining plates and metal pans, and by means of a ladder it was possible\nto go out on the roof, where, in the gutters between and the neighbor’s\nhouse, there stood a great chest filled with soil, my mother’s sole\ngarden, and where she grew her vegetables. In my story of the Snow\nQueen that garden still blooms.",
        "I was the only child, and was extremely spoiled, but I continually\nheard from my mother how very much happier I was than she had been, and\nthat I was brought up like a nobleman’s child. She, as a child, had\nbeen driven out by her parents to beg, and once when she was not able\nto do it, she had sate for a whole day under a bridge and wept. I have\ndrawn her character in two different aspects, in old Dominica, in the\nImprovisatore, and in the mother of Christian, in Only a Fiddler.",
        "My father gratified me in all my wishes. I possessed his whole heart;\nhe lived for me. On Sundays, he made me perspective glasses, theatres,\nand pictures which could be changed; he read to me from Holberg’s plays\nand the Arabian Tales; it was only in such moments as these that I can\nremember to have seen him really cheerful, for he never felt himself\nhappy in his life and as a handicrafts-man. His parents had been\ncountry people in good circumstances, but upon whom many misfortunes\nhad fallen; the cattle had died; the farm house had been burned down;\nand lastly, the husband had lost his reason. On this the wife had\nremoved with him to Odense, and there put her son, whose mind was full\nof intelligence, apprentice to a shoemaker; it could not be otherwise,\nalthough it was his ardent wish to be able to attend the Grammar\nSchool, where he might have learned Latin. A few well-to-do citizens\nhad at one time spoken of this, of clubbing together a sufficient sum\nto pay for his board and education, and thus giving him a start in\nlife; but it never went beyond words. My poor father saw his dearest\nwish unfulfilled; and he never lost the remembrance of it. I recollect\nthat once, as a child, I saw tears in his eyes, and it was when a youth\nfrom the Grammar School came to our house to be measured for a new pair\nof boots, and showed us his books and told us what he learned.",
        "“That was the path upon which I ought to have gone!” said my father,\nkissed me passionately, and was silent the whole evening.",
        "He very seldom associated with his equals. He went out into the woods\non Sundays, when he took me with him; he did not talk much when he was\nout, but would sit silently, sunk in deep thought, whilst I ran about\nand strung strawberries on a straw, or bound garlands. Only twice in\nthe year, and that in the month of May, when the woods were arrayed in\ntheir earliest green, did my mother go with us, and then she wore a\ncotton gown, which she put on only on these occasions, and when she\npartook of the Lord’s Supper, and which, as long as I can remember, was\nher holiday gown. She always took home with her from the wood a great\nmany fresh beech boughs, which were then planted behind the polished\nstone. Later in the year sprigs of St. John’s wort were stuck into the\nchinks of the beams, and we considered their growth as omens whether\nour lives would be long or short. Green branches and pictures\nornamented our little room, which my mother always kept neat and clean;\nshe took great pride in always having the bed-linen and the curtains\nvery white.",
        "The mother of my father came daily to our house, were it only for a\nmoment, in order to see her little grandson. I was her joy and her\ndelight. She was a quiet and most amiable old woman, with mild blue\neyes and a fine figure, which life had severely tried. From having been\nthe wife of a countryman in easy circumstances she had now fallen into\ngreat poverty, and dwelt with her feeble-minded husband in a little\nhouse, which was the last, poor remains of their property. I never saw\nher shed a tear. But it made all the deeper impression upon me when she\nquietly sighed, and told me about her own mother’s mother, how she had\nbeen a rich, noble lady in the city of Cassel, and that she had married\na “comedy-player,” that was as she expressed it, and run away from\nparents and home, for all of which her posterity had now to do penance.\nI never can recollect that I heard her mention the family name of her\ngrandmother; but her own maiden name was Nommesen. She was employed to\ntake care of the garden belonging to a lunatic asylum, and every Sunday\nevening she brought us some flowers, which they gave her permission to\ntake home with her. These flowers adorned my mother’s cupboard; but\nstill they were mine, and to me it was allowed to put them in the glass\nof water. How great was this pleasure! She brought them all to me; she\nloved me with her whole soul. I knew it, and I understood it.",
        "She burned, twice in the year, the green rubbish of the garden; on such\noccasions she took me with her to the asylum, and I lay upon the great\nheaps of green leaves and pea-straw. I had many flowers to play with,\nand–which was a circumstance upon which I set great importanceù I had\nhere better food to eat than I could expect at home.",
        "All such patients as were harmless were permitted to go freely about\nthe court; they often came to us in the garden, and with curiosity and\nterror I listened to them and followed them about; nay, I even ventured\nso far as to go with the attendants to those who were raving mad. A\nlong passage led to their cells. On one occasion, when the attendants\nwere out of the way, I lay down upon the floor, and peeped through the\ncrack of the door into one of these cells. I saw within a lady almost\nnaked, lying on her straw bed; her hair hung down over her shoulders,\nand she sang with a very beautiful voice. All at once she sprang up,\nand threw herself against the door where I lay; the little valve\nthrough which she received her food burst open; she stared down upon\nme, and stretched out her long arm towards me. I screamed for terror–I\nfelt the tips of her fingers touching my clothes–I was half dead when\nthe attendant came; and even in later years that sight and that feeling\nremained within my soul.",
        "Close beside the place where the leaves were burned, the poor old women\nhad their spinning-room. I often went in there, and was very soon a\nfavorite. When with these people, I found myself possessed of an\neloquence which filled them with astonishment. I had accidentally heard\nabout the internal mechanism of the human frame, of course without\nunderstanding anything about it; but all these mysteries were very\ncaptivating to me; and with chalk, therefore, I drew a quantity of\nflourishes on the door, which were to represent the intestines; and my\ndescription of the heart and the lungs made the deepest impression. I\npassed for a remarkably wise child, that would not live long; and they\nrewarded my eloquence by telling me tales in return; and thus a world\nas rich as that of the thousand and one nights was revealed to me. The\nstories told by these old ladies, and the insane figures which I saw\naround me in the asylum, operated in the meantime so powerfully upon\nme, that when it grew dark I scarcely dared to go out of the house. I\nwas therefore permitted, generally at sunset, to lay me down in my\nparents’ bed with its long flowered curtains, because the press-bed in\nwhich I slept could not conveniently be put down so early in the\nevening on account of the room it occupied in our small dwelling; and\nhere, in the paternal bed, lay I in a waking dream, as if the actual\nworld did not concern me. I was very much afraid of my weak-minded\ngrandfather. Only once had he ever spoken to me, and then he had made\nuse of the formal pronoun “you.” He employed himself in cutting out of\nwood strange figures, men with beasts’ heads, and beasts with wings;\nthese he packed in a basket and carried them out into the country,\nwhere he was everywhere well received by the peasant women, because he\ngave to them and their children these strange toys. One day, when he\nwas returning to Odense, I heard the boys in the street shouting after\nhim; I hid myself behind a flight of steps in terror, for I knew that I\nwas of his flesh and blood.",
        "Every circumstance around me tended to excite my imagination. Odense\nitself, in those days in which there was not a single steamboat in\nexistence, and when intercourse with other places was much more rare\nthan now, was a totally different city to what it is in our day; a\nperson might have fancied himself living hundreds of years ago, because\nso many customs prevailed then which belonged to an earlier age. The\nguilds walked in procession through the town with their harlequin\nbefore them with mace and bells; on Shrove Tuesday the butchers led the\nfattest ox through the streets adorned with garlands, whilst a boy in a\nwhite shirt and with great wings on his shoulders rode upon it; the\nsailors paraded through the city with music and all their flags flying,\nand then two of the boldest among them stood and wrestled upon a plank\nplaced between two boats, and the one who was not thrown into the water\nwas the victor.",
        "That, however, which more particularly stamped itself upon my memory,\nand became refreshed by after often-repeated relations, was, the abode\nof the Spaniards in Funen in 1808. It is true that at that time I was\nbut three years old; still I nevertheless perfectly remember the brown\nforeign men who made disturbances in the streets, and the cannon which\nwere fired. I saw the people lying on straw in a half-tumbledown\nchurch, which was near the asylum. One day, a Spanish soldier took me\nin his arms and pressed a silver image, which he wore upon his breast,\nto my lips. I remember that my mother was angry at it, because, she\nsaid, there was something papistical about it; but the image, and the\nstrange man, who danced me about, kissed me and wept, pleased me:\ncertainly he had children at home in Spain. I saw one of his comrades\nled to execution; he had killed a Frenchman. Many years afterwards this\nlittle circumstance occasioned me to write my little poem, “The\nSoldier,” which Chamisso translated into German, and which afterwards\nwas included in the illustrated people’s books of soldier-songs.\n[Footnote: This same little song, sent to me by the author, was\ntranslated by me and published in the 19th No. of Howitt’s Journal.–M.\nH.]  I very seldom played with other boys; even at school I took little\ninterest in their games, but remained sitting within doors. At home I\nhad playthings enough, which my father made for me. My greatest delight\nwas in making clothes for my dolls, or in stretching out one of my\nmother’s aprons between the wall and two sticks before a currant-bush\nwhich I had planted in the yard, and thus to gaze in between the sun-\nillumined leaves. I was a singularly dreamy child, and so constantly\nwent about with my eyes shut, as at last to give the impression of\nhaving weak sight, although the sense of sight was especially\ncultivated by me.",
        "Sometimes, during the harvest, my mother went into the field to glean.\nI accompanied her, and we went, like Ruth in the Bible, to glean in the\nrich fields of Boaz. One day we went to a place, the bailiff of which\nwas well known for being a man of a rude and savage disposition. We saw\nhim coming with a huge whip in his hand, and my mother and all the\nothers ran away. I had wooden shoes on my bare feet, and in my haste I\nlost these, and then the thorns pricked me so that I could not run, and\nthus I was left behind and alone. The man came up and lifted his whip\nto strike me, when I looked him in the face and involuntarily\nexclaimed,–",
        "“How dare you strike me, when God can see it?”",
        "The strong, stern man looked at me, and at once became mild; he patted\nme on my cheeks, asked me my name, and gave me money.",
        "When I brought this to my mother and showed it her, she said to the\nothers, “He is a strange child, my Hans Christian; everybody is kind to\nhim: this bad fellow even has given him money.”",
        "I grew up pious and superstitious. I had no idea of want or need; to be\nsure my parents had only sufficient to live from day to day, but I at\nleast had plenty of every thing; an old woman altered my father’s\nclothes for me. Now and then I went with my parents to the theatre,\nwhere the first representations which I saw were in German. “Das\nDonauweibchen” was the favorite piece of the whole city; there,\nhowever, I saw, for the first time, Holberg’s Village Politicians\ntreated as an opera.",
        "The first impression which a theatre and the crowd assembled there made\nupon me was, at all events, no sign of any thing poetical slumbering in\nme; for my first exclamation on seeing so many people, was, “Now, if we\nonly had as many casks of butter as there are people here, then I would\neat lots of butter!” The theatre, however, soon became my favorite\nplace, but, as I could only very seldom go there, I acquired the\nfriendship of the man who carried out the playbills, and he gave me one\nevery day. With this I seated myself in a corner and imagined an entire\nplay, according to the name of the piece and the characters in it. That\nwas my first, unconscious poetising.",
        "My father’s favorite reading was plays and stories, although he also\nread works of history and the Scriptures. He pondered in silent thought\nafterwards upon that which he had read, but my mother did not\nunderstand him when he talked with her about them, and therefore he\ngrew more and more silent. One day, he closed the Bible with the words,\n\"Christ was a man like us, but an extraordinary man!” These words\nhorrified my mother, and she burst into tears. In my distress I prayed\nto God that he would forgive this fearful blasphemy in my father.\n\"There is no other devil than that which we have in our own hearts,” I\nheard my father say one day and I made myself miserable about him and\nhis soul; I was therefore entirely of the opinion of my mother and the\nneighbours, when my father, one morning, found three scratches on his\narm, probably occasioned by a nail, that the devil had been to visit\nhim in the night, in order to prove to him that he really existed. My\nfather’s rambles in the wood became more frequent; he had no rest. The\nevents of the war in Germany, which he read in the newspapers with\neager curiosity, occupied him completely. Napoleon was his hero: his\nrise from obscurity was the most beautiful example to him. At that time\nDenmark was in league with France; nothing was talked of but war; my\nfather entered the service as a soldier, in hope of returning home a\nlieutenant. My mother wept. The neighbours shrugged their shoulders,\nand said that it was folly to go out to be shot when there was no\noccasion for it.",
        "The morning on which the corps were to march I heard my father singing\nand talking merrily, but his heart was deeply agitated; I observed that\nby the passionate manner in which he kissed me when he took his leave.\nI lay sick of the measles and alone in the room, when the drums beat\nand my mother accompanied my father, weeping, to the city gate. As soon\nas they were gone my old grandmother came in; she looked at me with her\nmild eyes and said, it would be a good thing if I died; but that God’s\nwill was always the best.",
        "That was the first day of real sorrow which I remember.",
        "The regiment advanced no farther than Holstein, peace was concluded,\nand the voluntary soldier returned to his work-stool. Everything fell\ninto its old course. I played again with my dolls, acted comedies, and\nalways in German, because I had only seen them in this language; but my\nGerman was a sort of gibberish which I made up, and in which there\noccurred only one real German word, and that was ’Besen,” a word\nwhich I had picked up out of the various dialects which my father\nbrought home from Holstein.",
        "“Thou hast indeed some benefit from my travels,” said he in joke. “God\nknows whether thou wilt get as far; but that must be thy care. Think\nabout it, Hans Christian!” But it was my mother’s intention that as\nlong as she had any voice in the matter, I should remain at home, and\nnot lose my health as he had done.",
        "That was the case with him; his health had suffered. One morning he\nwoke in a state of the wildest excitement, and talked only of campaigns\nand Napoleon. He fancied that he had received orders from him to take\nthe command. My mother immediately sent me, not to the physician, but\nto a so-called wise woman some miles from Odense. I went to her. She\nquestioned me, measured my arm with a woolen thread, made extraordinary\nsigns, and at last laid a green twig upon my breast. It was, she said,\na piece of the same kind of tree upon which the Saviour was crucified.",
        "“Go now,” said she, “by the river side towards home. If your father\nwill die this time, then you will meet his ghost.”",
        "My anxiety and distress may be imagined,–I, who was so full of\nsuperstition, and whose imagination was so easily excited.",
        "“And thou hast not met anything, hast thou?” inquired my mother when I\ngot home. I assured her, with beating heart, that I had not.",
        "My father died the third day after that. His corpse lay on the bed: I\ntherefore slept with my mother. A cricket chirped the whole night\nthrough.",
        "“He is dead,” said my mother, addressing it; “thou needest not call\nhim. The ice maiden has fetched him.”",
        "I understood what she meant. I recollected that, in the winter before,\nwhen our window panes were frozen, my father pointed to them and showed\nus a figure as that of a maiden with outstretched arms. “She is come to\nfetch me,” said he, in jest. And now, when he lay dead on the bed, my\nmother remembered this, and it occupied my thoughts also.",
        "He was buried in St. Knud’s churchyard, by the door on the left hand\nside coming from the altar. My grandmother planted roses upon his\ngrave. There are now in the selfsame place two strangers’ graves, and\nthe grass grows green upon them also.",
        "After my father’s death I was entirely left to myself. My mother went\nout washing. I sate alone at home with my little theatre, made dolls’\nclothes and read plays. It has been told me that I was always clean and\nnicely dressed. I had grown tall; my hair was long, bright, and almost\nyellow, and I always went bare-headed. There dwelt in our neighborhood\nthe widow of a clergyman, Madame Bunkeflod, with the sister of her\ndeceased husband. This lady opened to me her door, and hers was the\nfirst house belonging to the educated class into which I was kindly\nreceived. The deceased clergyman had written poems, and had gained a\nreputation in Danish literature. His spinning songs were at that time\nin the mouths of the people. In my vignettes to the Danish poets I thus\nsang of him whom my contemporaries had forgotten:–",
        "  Spindles rattle, wheels turn round,\n    Spinning-songs depart;\n  Songs which youth sings soon become\n    Music of the heart.",
        "Here it was that I heard for the first time the word poetspoken, and that with so much reverence, as proved it to be something\nsacred. It is true that my father had read Holberg’s play to me; but\nhere it was not of these that they spoke, but of verses and poetry. “My\nbrother the poet,” said Bunkeflod’s sister, and her eyes sparkled as\nshe said it. From her I learned that it was a something glorious, a\nsomething fortunate, to be a poet. Here, too, for the first time, I\nread Shakspeare, in a bad translation, to be sure; but the bold\ndescriptions, the heroic incidents, witches, and ghosts were exactly to\nmy taste. I immediately acted Shakspeare’s plays on my little puppet\ntheatre. I saw Hamlet’s ghost, and lived upon the heath with Lear. The\nmore persons died in a play, the more interesting I thought it. At this\ntime I wrote my first piece: it was nothing less than a tragedy,\nwherein, as a matter of course, everybody died. The subject of it I\nborrowed from an old song about Pyramus and Thisbe; but I had increased\nthe incidents through a hermit and his son, who both loved Thisbe, and\nwho both killed themselves when she died. Many speeches of the hermit\nwere passages from the Bible, taken out of the little catechism,\nespecially from our duty to our neighbors. To the piece I gave the\ntitle “Abor and Elvira.”",
        "“It ought to be called ’Perch (Aborre) and Stockfish,’” said one of our\nneighbors wittily to me, as I came with it to her after having read it\nwith great satisfaction and joy to all the people in our street. This\nentirely depressed me, because I felt that she was turning both me and\nmy poem to ridicule. With a troubled heart I told it to my mother.",
        "“She only said so,” replied my mother, “because her son had not done\nit.” I was comforted, and began a new piece, in which a king and queen\nwere among the dramatis personae. I thought it was not quite right that\nthese dignified personages, as in Shakspeare, should speak like other\nmen and women. I asked my mother and different people how a king ought\nproperly to speak, but no one knew exactly. They said that it was so\nmany years since a king had been in Odense, but that he certainly spoke\nin a foreign language. I procured myself, therefore, a sort of lexicon,\nin which were German, French, and English words with Danish meanings,\nand this helped me. I took a word out of each language, and inserted\nthem into the speeches of my king and queen. It was a regular Babel-\nlike language, which I considered only suitable for such elevated\npersonages.",
        "I desired now that everybody should hear my piece. It was a real\nfelicity to me to read it aloud, and it never occurred to me that\nothers should not have the same pleasure in listening to it.",
        "The son of one of our neighbors worked in a cloth manufactory, and\nevery week brought home a sum of money. I was at a loose end, people\nsaid, and got nothing. I was also now to go to the manufactory, “not\nfor the sake of the money,” my mother said, “but that she might know\nwhere I was, and what I was doing.”",
        "My old grandmother took me to the place, therefore, and was very much\naffected, because, said she, she had not expected to live to see the\ntime when I should consort with the poor ragged lads that worked there.",
        "Many of the journeymen who were employed in the manufactory were\nGermans; they sang and were merry fellows, and many a coarse joke of\ntheirs filled the place with loud laughter. I heard them, and I there\nlearned that, to the innocent ears of a child, the impure remains very\nunintelligible. It took no hold upon my heart. I was possessed at that\ntime of a remarkably beautiful and high soprano voice, and I knew it;\nbecause when I sang in my parents’ little garden, the people in the\nstreet stood and listened, and the fine folks in the garden of the\nstates-councillor, which adjoined ours, listened at the fence. When,\ntherefore, the people at the manufactory asked me whether I could sing,\nI immediately began, and all the looms stood still: all the journeymen\nlistened to me. I had to sing again and again, whilst the other boys\nhad my work given them to do. I now told them that I also could act\nplays, and that I knew whole scenes of Holberg and Shakspeare.\nEverybody liked me; and in this way, the first days in the manufactory\npassed on very merrily. One day, however, when I was in my best singing\nvein, and everybody spoke of the extraordinary brilliancy of my voice,\none of the journeymen said that I was a girl, and not a boy. He seized\nhold of me. I cried and screamed. The other journeymen thought it very\namusing, and held me fast by my arms and legs. I screamed aloud, and\nwas as much ashamed as a girl; and then, darting from them, rushed home\nto my mother, who immediately promised me that I should never go there\nagain.",
        "I again visited Madame Bunkeflod, for whose birthday I invented and\nmade a white silk pincushion. I also made an acquaintance with another\nold clergyman’s widow in the neighborhood. She permitted me to read\naloud to her the works which she had from the circulating library. One\nof them began with these words: “It was a tempestuous night; the rain\nbeat against the window-panes.”",
        "“That is an extraordinary book,” said the old lady; and I quite\ninnocently asked her how she knew that it was. “I can tell from the\nbeginning,” said she, “that it will turn out extraordinary.”",
        "I regarded her penetration with a sort of reverence.",
        "Once in the harvest time my mother took me with her many miles from\nOdense to a nobleman’s seat in the neighborhood of Bogense, her native\nplace. The lady who lived there, and with whose parents my mother had\nlived, had said that some time she might come and see her. That was a\ngreat journey for me: we went most of the way on foot, and required, I\nbelieve, two days for the journey. The country here made such a strong\nimpression upon me, that my most earnest wish was to remain in it, and\nbecome a countryman. It was just in the hop-picking season; my mother\nand I sat in the barn with a great many country people round a great\nbinn, and helped to pick the hops. They told tales as they sat at their\nwork, and every one related what wonderful things he had seen or\nexperienced. One afternoon I heard an old man among them say that God\nknew every thing, both what had happened and what would happen. That\nidea occupied my whole mind, and towards evening, as I went alone from\nthe court, where there was a deep pond, and stood upon some stones\nwhich were just within the water, the thought passed through my head,\nwhether God actually knew everything which was to happen there. Yes, he\nhas now determined that I should live and be so many years old, thought\nI; but, if I now were to jump into the water here and drown myself,\nthen it would not be as he wished; and all at once I was firmly and\nresolutely determined to drown myself. I ran to where the water was\ndeepest, and then a new thought passed through my soul. “It is the\ndevil who wishes to have power over me!” I uttered a loud cry, and,\nrunning away from the place as if I were pursued, fell weeping into my\nmother’s arms. But neither she nor any one else could wring from me\nwhat was amiss with me.",
        "“He has certainly seen a ghost,” said one of the women; and I almost\nbelieved so myself.",
        "My mother married a second time, a young handicraftsman; but his\nfamily, who also belonged to the handicraft class, thought that he had\nmarried below himself, and neither my mother nor myself were permitted\nto visit them. My step-father was a young, grave man, who would have\nnothing to do with my education. I spent my time, therefore, over my\npeep show and my puppet theatre, and my greatest happiness consisted in\ncollecting bright colored pieces of cloth and silk, which I cut out\nmyself and sewed. My mother regarded it as good exercise preparatory to\nmy becoming a tailor, and took up the idea that I certainly was born\nfor it. I, on the contrary, said that I would go to the theatre and be\nan actor, a wish which my mother most sedulously opposed, because she\nknew of no other theatre than those of the strolling players and the\nrope-dancers. No, a tailor I must and should be. The only thing which\nin some measure reconciled me to this prospect was, that I should then\nget so many fragments to make up for my theatre.",
        "My passion for reading, the many dramatic scenes which I knew by heart,\nand my remarkably fine voice, had turned upon me in some sort the\nattention of several of the more influential families of Odense. I was\nsent for to their houses, and the peculiar characteristics of my mind\nexcited their interest. Among others who noticed me was the Colonel\nHoegh-Guldberg, who with his family showed me the kindest sympathy; so\nmuch so, indeed, that he introduced me to the present king, then Prince\nChristian.",
        "I grew rapidly, and was a tall lad, of whom my mother said that she\ncould not let him any longer go about without any object in life. I was\nsent, therefore, to the charity school, but learned only religion,\nwriting, and arithmetic, and the last badly enough; I could also\nscarcely spell a word correctly. On the master’s birthday I always wove\nhim a garland and wrote him a poem; he received them half with smiles\nand half as a joke; the last time, however, he scolded me. The street\nlads had also heard from their parents of my peculiar turn of mind, and\nthat I was in the habit of going to the houses of the gentry. I was\ntherefore one day pursued by a wild crowd of them, who shouted after me\nderisively, “There runs the play-writer!” I hid myself at home in a\ncorner, wept, and prayed to God.",
        "My mother said that I must be confirmed, in order that I might be\napprenticed to the tailor trade, and thus do something rational. She\nloved me with her whole heart, but she did not understand my impulses\nand my endeavors, nor indeed at that time did I myself. The people\nabout her always spoke against my odd ways, and turned me to ridicule.",
        "We belonged to the parish of St. Knud, and the candidates for\nconfirmation could either enter their names with the prevost or the\nchaplain. The children of the so-called superior families and the\nscholars of the grammar school went to the first, and the children of\nthe poor to the second. I, however, announced myself as a candidate to\nthe prevost, who was obliged to receive me, although he discovered\nvanity in my placing myself among his catechists, where, although\ntaking the lowest place, I was still above those who were under the\ncare of the chaplain. I would, however, hope that it was not alone\nvanity which impelled me. I had a sort of fear of the poor boys, who\nhad laughed at me, and I always felt as it were an inward drawing\ntowards the scholars of the grammar school, whom I regarded as far\nbetter than other boys. When I saw them playing in the church-yard, I\nwould stand outside the railings, and wish that I were but among the\nfortunate ones,–not for the sake of play, but for the sake of the many\nbooks they had, and for what they might be able to become in the world.\nWith the prevost, therefore, I should be able to come together with\nthem, and be as they were; but I do not remember a single one of them\nnow, so little intercourse would they hold with me. I had daily the\nfeeling of having thrust myself in where people thought that I did not\nbelong. One young girl, however, there was, and one who was considered\ntoo of the highest rank, whom I shall afterwards have to mention; she\nalways looked gently and kindly at me, and even once gave me a rose. I\nreturned home full of happiness, because there was one being who did\nnot overlook and repel me.",
        "An old female tailor altered my deceased father’s great coat into a\nconfirmation suit for me; never before had I worn so good a coat. I had\nalso for the first time in my life a pair of boots. My delight was\nextremely great; my only fear was that everybody would not see them,\nand therefore I drew them up over my trousers, and thus marched through\nthe church. The boots creaked, and that inwardly pleased me, for thus\nthe congregation would hear that they were new. My whole devotion was\ndisturbed; I was aware of it, and it caused me a horrible pang of\nconscience that my thoughts should be as much with my new boots as with\nGod. I prayed him earnestly from my heart to forgive me, and then again\nI thought about my new boots.",
        "During the last year I had saved together a little sum of money. When I\ncounted it over I found it to be thirteen rix dollars banco (about\nthirty shillings) I was quite overjoyed at the possession of so much\nwealth, and as my mother now most resolutely required that I should be\napprenticed to a tailor, I prayed and besought her that I might make a\njourney to Copenhagen, that I might see the greatest city in the world.\n\"What wilt thou do there?” asked my mother.",
        "“I will become famous,” returned I, and I then told her all that I had\nread about extraordinary men. “People have,” said I, “at first an\nimmense deal of adversity to go through, and then they will be famous.”",
        "It was a wholly unintelligible impulse that guided me. I wept, I\nprayed, and at last my mother consented, after having first sent for a\nso-called wise woman out of the hospital, that she might read my future\nfortune by the coffee-grounds and cards.",
        "“Your son will become a great man,” said the old woman, “and in honor\nof him, Odense will one day be illuminated.”",
        "My mother wept when she heard that, and I obtained permission to\ntravel. All the neighbors told my mother that it was a dreadful thing\nto let me, at only fourteen years of age, go to Copenhagen, which was\nsuch a long way off, and such a great and intricate city, and where I\nknew nobody.",
        "“Yes,” replied my mother, “but he lets me have no peace; I have\ntherefore given my consent, but I am sure that he will go no further\nthan Nyborg; when he gets sight of the rough sea, he will be frightened\nand turn back again.”",
        "During the summer before my confirmation, a part of the singers and\nperformers of the Theatre Royal had been in Odense, and had given a\nseries of operas and tragedies there. The whole city was taken with\nthem. I, who was on good terms with the man who delivered the play-\nbills, saw the performances behind the scenes, and had even acted a\npart as page, shepherd, etc., and had spoken a few words. My zeal was\nso great on such occasions, that I stood there fully apparelled when\nthe actors arrived to dress. By these means their attention was turned\nto me; my childlike manners and my enthusiasm amused them; they talked\nkindly with me, and I looked up to them as to earthly divinities.\nEverything which I had formerly heard about my musical voice, and my\nrecitation of poetry, became intelligible to me. It was the theatre for\nwhich I was born: it was there that I should become a famous man, and\nfor that reason Copenhagen was the goal of my endeavors. I heard a deal\nsaid about the large theatre in Copenhagen, and that there was to be\nsoon what was called the ballet, a something which surpassed both the\nopera and the play; more especially did I hear the solo-dancer, Madame\nSchall, spoken of as the first of all. She therefore appeared to me as\nthe queen of everything, and in my imagination I regarded her as the\none who would be able to do everything for me, if I could only obtain\nher support. Filled with these thoughts, I went to the old printer\nIversen, one of the most respectable citizens of Odense, and who, as I\nheard, had had considerable intercourse with the actors when they were\nin the town. He, I thought, must of necessity be acquainted with the\nfamous dancer; him I would request to give me a letter of introduction\nto her, and then I would commit the rest to God.",
        "The old man saw me for the first time, and heard my petition with much\nkindness; but he dissuaded me most earnestly from it, and said that I\nmight learn a trade.",
        "“That would actually be a great sin,” returned I.",
        "He was startled at the manner in which I said that, and it prepossessed\nhim in my favor; he confessed that he was not personally acquainted\nwith the dancer, but still that he would give me a letter to her. I\nreceived one from him, and now believed the goal to be nearly won.",
        "My mother packed up my clothes in a small bundle, and made a bargain\nwith the driver of a post carriage to take me back with him to\nCopenhagen for three rix dollars banco. The afternoon on which we were\nto set out came, and my mother accompanied me to the city gate. Here\nstood my old grandmother; in the last few years her beautiful hair had\nbecome grey; she fell upon my neck and wept, without being able to\nspeak a word. I was myself deeply affected. And thus we parted. I saw\nher no more; she died in the following year.",
        "I do not even know her grave; she sleeps in the poor-house burial-\nground.",
        "The postilion blew his horn; it was a glorious sunny afternoon, and the\nsunshine soon entered into my gay child-like mind. I delighted in every\nnovel object which met my eye, and I was journeying towards the goal of\nmy soul’s desires. When, however, I arrived at Nyborg on the great\nBelt, and was borne in the ship away from my native island, I then\ntruly felt how alone and forlorn I was, and that I had no one else\nexcept God in heaven to depend upon.",
        "As soon as I set foot on Zealand, I stepped behind a shed, which stood\non the shore, and falling upon my knees, besought of God to help and\nguide me aright; I felt myself comforted by so doing, and I firmly\ntrusted in God and my own good fortune. The whole day and the following\nnight I travelled through cities and villages; I stood solitarily by\nthe carriage, and ate my bread while it was repacked.–I thought I was\nfar away in the wide world.",
        "On Monday morning, September 5th, 1819, I saw from the heights of\nFrederiksburg, Copenhagen, for the first time. At this place I alighted\nfrom the carriage, and with my little bundle in my hand, entered the\ncity through the castle garden, the long alley and the suburb.",
        "The evening before my arrival had been made memorable by the breaking\nout of the so-called Jews quarrel, which spread through many European\ncountries. The whole city was in commotion [Footnote: This remarkable\ndisturbance makes a fine incident in Anderson’s romance of “Only a\nFiddler.\"–M. H.]; every body was in the streets; the noise and tumult\nof Copenhagen far exceeded, therefore, any idea which my imagination\nhad formed of this, at that time, to me great city.",
        "With scarcely ten dollars in my pocket, I turned into a small public-\nhouse. My first ramble was to the theatre. I went round it many times;\nI looked up to its walls, and regarded them almost as a home. One of\nthe bill-sellers, who wandered about here each day, observed me, and\nasked me if I would have a bill. I was so wholly ignorant of the world,\nthat I thought the man wished to give me one; I therefore accepted his\noffer with thankfulness. He fancied I was making fun of him and was\nangry; so that I was frightened, and hastened from the place which was\nto me the dearest in the city. Little did I then imagine that ten years\nafterwards my first dramatic piece would be represented there, and that\nin this manner I should make my appearance before the Danish public. On\nthe following day I dressed myself in my confirmation suit, nor were\nthe boots forgotten, although, this time, they were worn, naturally,\nunder my trousers; and thus, in my best attire, with a hat on, which\nfell half over my eyes, I hastened to present my letter of introduction\nto the dancer, Madame Schall. Before I rung at the bell, I fell on my\nknees before the door and prayed God that I here might find help and\nsupport. A maid-servant came down the steps with her basket in her\nhand; she smiled kindly at me, gave me a skilling (Danish), and tripped\non. Astonished, I looked at her and the money. I had on my confirmation\nsuit, and thought I must look very smart. How then could she think that\nI wanted to beg? I called after her.",
        "“Keep it, keep it!” said she to me, in return, and was gone.",
        "At length I was admitted to the dancer; she looked at me in great\namazement, and then heard what I had to say. She had not the slightest\nknowledge of him from whom the letter came, and my whole appearance and\nbehavior seemed very strange to her. I confessed to her my heartfelt\ninclination for the theatre; and upon her asking me what characters I\nthought I could represent, I replied, Cinderella. This piece had been\nperformed in Odense by the royal company, and the principal characters\nhad so greatly taken my fancy, that I could play the part perfectly\nfrom memory. In the mean time I asked her permission to take off my\nboots, otherwise I was not light enough for this character; and then\ntaking up my broad hat for a tambourine, I began to dance and sing,–",
        "  “Here below, nor rank nor riches,   Are exempt from pain and woe.”",
        "My strange gestures and my great activity caused the lady to think me\nout of my mind, and she lost no time in getting rid of me.",
        "From her I went to the manager of the theatre, to ask for an\nengagement. He looked at me, and said that I was “too thin for the\ntheatre.”",
        "“Oh,” replied I, “if you will only engage me with one hundred rix\ndollars banco salary, then I shall soon get fat!” The manager bade me\ngravely go my way, adding, that they only engaged people of education.",
        "I stood there deeply wounded. I knew no one in all Copenhagen who could\ngive me either counsel or consolation. I thought of death as being the\nonly thing, and the best thing for me; but even then my thoughts rose\nupwards to God, and with all the undoubting confidence of a child in\nhis father, they riveted themselves upon Him. I wept bitterly, and then\nI said to myself, “When everything happens really miserably, then he\nsends help. I have always read so. People must first of all suffer a\ngreat deal before they can bring anything to accomplishment.”",
        "I now went and bought myself a gallery-ticket for the opera of Paul and\nVirginia. The separation of the lovers affected me to such a degree,\nthat I burst into violent weeping. A few women, who sat near me,\nconsoled me by saying that it was only a play, and nothing to trouble\noneself about; and then they gave me a sausage sandwich. I had the\ngreatest confidence in everybody, and therefore I told them, with the\nutmost openness, that I did not really weep about Paul and Virginia,\nbut because I regarded the theatre as my Virginia, and that if I must\nbe separated from it, I should be just as wretched as Paul. They looked\nat me, and seemed not to understand my meaning. I then told them why I\nhad come to Copenhagen, and how forlorn I was there. One of the women,\ntherefore, gave me more, bread and butter, with fruit and cakes.",
        "On the following morning I paid my bill, and to my infinite trouble I\nsaw that my whole wealth consisted in one rix dollar banco. It was\nnecessary, therefore, either that I should find some vessel to take me\nhome, or put myself to work with some handicraftsman. I considered that\nthe last was the wiser of the two, because, if I returned to Odense, I\nmust there also put myself to work of a similar kind; besides which, I\nknew very well that the people there would laugh at me if I came back\nagain. It was to me a matter of indifference what handicraft trade I\nlearned,–I only should make use of it to keep life within me in\nCopenhagen. I bought a newspaper, therefore. I found among the\nadvertisements that a cabinet maker was in want of an apprentice. The\nman received me kindly, but said that before I was bound to him he must\nhave an attestation, and my baptismal register from Odense; and that\ntill these came I could remove to his house, and try how the business\npleased me. At six o’clock the next morning I went to the workshop:\nseveral journeymen were there, and two or three apprentices; but the\nmaster was not come. They fell into merry and idle discourse. I was as\nbashful as a girl, and as they soon perceived this, I was unmercifully\nrallied upon it. Later in the day the rude jests of the young fellows\nwent so far, that, in remembrance of the scene at the manufactory, I\ntook the resolute determination not to remain a single day longer in\nthe workshop. I went down to the master, therefore, and told him that I\ncould not stand it; he tried to console me, but in vain: I was too much\naffected, and hastened away.",
        "I now went through the streets; nobody knew me; I was quite forlorn. I\nthen bethought myself of having read in a newspaper in Odense the name\nof an Italian, Siboni, who was the director of the Academy of Music in\nCopenhagen. Everybody had praised my voice; perhaps he would assist me\nfor its sake; if not, then that very evening I must seek out the master\nof some vessel who would take me home again. At the thoughts of the\njourney home I became still more violently excited, and in this state\nof suffering I hastened to Siboni’s house.",
        "It happened that very day that he had a large party to dinner; our\ncelebrated composer Weyse was there, the poet Baggesen, and other\nguests. The housekeeper opened the door to me, and to her I not only\nrelated my wish to be engaged as a singer, but also the whole history\nof my life. She listened to me with the greatest sympathy, and then she\nleft me. I waited a long time, and she must have been repeating to the\ncompany the greater part of what I had said, for, in a while, the door\nopened, and all the guests came out and looked at me. They would have\nme to sing, and Siboni heard me attentively. I gave some scenes out of\nHolberg, and repeated a few poems; and then, all at once, the sense of\nmy unhappy condition so overcame me that I burst into tears; the whole\ncompany applauded.",
        "“I prophesy,” said Baggesen, “that one day something will come out of\nhim; but do not be vain when, some day, the whole public shall applaud\nthee!” and then he added something about pure, true nature, and that\nthis is too often destroyed by years and by intercourse with mankind. I\ndid not understand it all.",
        "Siboni promised to cultivate my voice, and that I therefore should\nsucceed as singer at the Theatre Royal. It made me very happy; I\nlaughed and wept; and as the housekeeper led me out and saw the\nexcitement under which I labored, she stroked my cheeks, and said that\non the following day I should go to Professor Weyse, who meant to do\nsomething for me, and upon whom I could depend.",
        "I went to Weyse, who himself had risen from poverty; he had deeply felt\nand fully comprehended my unhappy situation, and had raised by a\nsubscription seventy rix dollars banco for me. I then wrote my first\nletter to my mother, a letter full of rejoicing, for the good fortune\nof the whole world seemed poured upon me. My mother in her joy showed\nmy letter to all her friends; many heard of it with astonishment;\nothers laughed at it, for what was to be the end of it? In order to\nunderstand Siboni it was necessary for me to learn something of German.\nA woman of Copenhagen, with whom I travelled from Odense to this city,\nand who gladly, according to her means, would have supported me,\nobtained, through one of her acquaintance, a language-master, who\ngratuitously gave me some German lessons, and thus I learned a few\nphrases in that language. Siboni received me into his house, and gave\nme food and instruction; but half a year afterwards my voice broke, or\nwas injured, in consequence of my being compelled to wear bad shoes\nthrough the winter, and having besides no warm under-clothing. There\nwas no longer any prospect that I should become a fine singer. Siboni\ntold me that candidly, and counselled me to go to Odense, and there\nlearn a trade.",
        "I, who in the rich colors of fancy had described to my mother the\nhappiness which I actually felt, must now return home and become an\nobject of derision! Agonized with this thought, I stood as if crushed\nto the earth. Yet, precisely amid this apparently great un-happiness\nlay the stepping-stones of a better fortune.",
        "As I found myself again abandoned, and was pondering by myself upon\nwhat was best for me next to do, it occurred to me that the Poet\nGuldberg, a brother of the Colonel of that name in Odense, who had\nshown me so much kindness, lived in Copenhagen. He lived at that time\nnear the new church-yard outside the city, of which he has so\nbeautifully sung in his poems. I wrote to him, and related to him\neverything; afterwards I went to him myself, and found him surrounded\nwith books and tobacco pipes. The strong, warm-hearted man received me\nkindly; and as he saw by my letter how incorrectly I wrote, he promised\nto give me instruction in the Danish tongue; he examined me a little in\nGerman, and thought that it would be well if he could improve me in\nthis respect also. More than this, he made me a present of the profits\nof a little work which he had just then published; it became known, and\nI believe they exceeded one hundred rix dollars banco; the excellent\nWeyse and others also supported me.",
        "It was too expensive for me to lodge at a public house; I was therefore\nobliged to seek for private lodgings. My ignorance of the world led me\nto a widow who lived in one of the most disreputable streets of\nCopenhagen; she was inclined to receive me into her house, and I never\nsuspected what kind of world it was which moved around me. She was a\nstern, but active dame; she described to me the other people of the\ncity in such horrible colors as made me suppose that I was in the only\nsafe haven there. I was to pay twenty rix dollars monthly for one room,\nwhich was nothing but an empty store-room, without window and light,\nbut I had permission to sit in her parlor. I was to make trial of it at\nfirst for two days, meantime on the following day she told me that I\ncould decide to stay or immediately go. I, who so easily attach myself\nto people, already liked her, and felt myself at home with her; but\nmore than sixteen dollars per month Weyse had told me I must not pay,\nand this was the sum which I had received from him and Guldberg, so\nthat no surplus remained to me for my other expenses. This troubled me\nvery much; when she was gone out of the room, I seated myself on the\nsofa, and contemplated the portrait of her deceased husband.",
        "I was so wholly a child, that as the tears rolled down my own cheeks, I\nwetted the eyes of the portrait with my tears, in order that the dead\nman might feel how troubled I was, and influence the heart of his wife.\nShe must have seen that nothing more was to be drained out of me, for\nwhen she returned to the room she said that she would receive me into\nher house for the sixteen rix dollars. I thanked God and the dead man.\nI found myself in the midst of the mysteries of Copenhagen, but I did\nnot understand how to interpret them. There was in the house in which I\nlived a friendly young lady, who lived alone, and often wept; every\nevening her old father came and paid her a visit. I opened the door to\nhim frequently; he wore a plain sort of coat, had his throat very much\ntied up, and his hat pulled over his eyes. He always drank his tea with\nher, and nobody dared to be present, because he was not fond of\ncompany: she never seemed very glad at his coming. [Footnote: This\ncharacter will be recognised in Steffen Margaret, in Only a Fiddler.–\nM. H.] Many years afterwards, when I had reached another step on the\nladder of life, when the refined world of fashionable life was opened\nbefore me, I saw one evening, in the midst of a brilliantly lighted\nhall, a polite old gentleman covered with orders–that was the old\nfather in the shabby coat, he whom I had let in. He had little idea\nthat I had opened the door to him when he played his part as guest, but\nI, on my side, then had also no thought but for my own comedy-playing;\nthat is to say, I was at that time so much of a child that I played\nwith my puppet-theatre and made my dolls’ clothes; and in order that I\nmight obtain gaily-colored fragments for this purpose, I used to go to\nthe shops and ask for patterns of various kinds of stuffs and ribbons.\nI myself did not possess a single farthing; my landlady received all\nthe money each month in advance; only now and then, when I did any\nerrands for her, she gave me something, and that went in the purchase\nof paper or for old play-books. I was now very happy, and was doubly so\nbecause Professor Guldberg had induced Lindgron, the first comic actor\nat the theatre, to give me instruction. He gave me several parts in\nHolberg to learn, such as Hendrik, and the Silly Boy, for which I had\nshown some talent. My desire, however, was to play the Correggio. I\nobtained permission to learn this piece in my own way, although\nLindgron asked, with comic gravity, whether I expected to resemble the\ngreat painter? I, however, repeated to him the soliloquy in the picture\ngallery with so much feeling, that the old man clapped me on the\nshoulder and said, “Feeling you have; but you must not be an actor,\nthough God knows what else. Speak to Guldberg about your learning\nLatin: that always opens the way for a student.”",
        "I a student! That was a thought which had never come before into my\nhead. The theatre lay nearer to me, and was dearer too; but Latin I had\nalso always wished to learn. But before I spoke on the subject to\nGuldberg, I mentioned it to the lady who gave me gratuitous instruction\nin German; but she told me that Latin was the most expensive language\nin the world, and that it was not possible to gain free instruction  in\nit. Guldberg, however, managed it so that one of his friends, out of\nkindness, gave me two lessons a week.",
        "The dancer, Dahlen, whose wife at that time was one of the first\nartistes on the Danish boards, opened his house to me. I passed many an\nevening there, and the gentle, warm-hearted lady was kind to me. The\nhusband took me with him to the dancing-school, and that was to me one\nstep nearer to the theatre. There stood I for whole mornings, with a\nlong staff, and stretched my legs; but notwithstanding all my good-\nwill, it was Dahlen’s opinion that I should never get beyond a\nfigurante. One advantage, however, I had gained; I might in an evening\nmake my appearance behind the scenes of the theatre; nay, even sit upon\nthe farthest bench in the box of the figurantes. It seemed to me as if\nI had got my foot just within the theatre, although I had never yet\nbeen upon the stage itself.",
        "One night the little opera of the Two Little Savoyards was given; in\nthe market scene every one, even the mechanists, might go up to help in\nfilling the stage; I heard them say so, and rouging myself a little, I\nwent happily up with the others. I was in my ordinary dress; the\nconfirmation coat, which still held together, although, with regard to\nbrushing and repairs, it looked but miserably, and the great hat which\nfell down over my face. I was very conscious of the ill condition of my\nattire, and would have been glad to have concealed it; but, through the\nendeavor to do so, my movements became still more angular. I did not\ndare to hold myself upright, because, by so doing, I exhibited all the\nmore plainly the shortness of my waistcoat, which I had outgrown. I had\nthe feeling very plainly that people would make themselves merry about\nme; yet, at this moment, I felt nothing but the happiness of stepping\nfor the first time before the foot-lamps. My heart beat; I stepped\nforward; there came up one of the singers, who at that time was much\nthought of, but now is forgotten; he took me by the hand, and jeeringly\nwished me happiness on my d but. “Allow me to introduce you to the\nDanish public,” said he, and drew me forward to the lamps. The people\nwould laugh at me–I felt it; the tears rolled down my cheeks; I tore\nmyself loose, and left the stage full of anguish.",
        "Shortly after this, Dahlen arranged a ballet of Armida, in which I\nreceived a little part: I was a spirit. In this ballet I became\nacquainted with the lady of Professor Heiberg, the wife of the poet,\nand now a highly esteemed actress on the Danish stage; she, then a\nlittle girl, had also a part in it, and our names stood printed in the\nbill. That was a moment in my life, when my name was printed! I fancied\nI could see it a nimbus of immortality. I was continually looking at\nthe printed paper. I carried the programme of the ballet with me at\nnight to bed, lay and read my name by candle light–in short, I was\nhappy.",
        "I had now been two years in Copenhagen. The sum of money which had been\ncollected for me was expended, but I was ashamed of making known my\nwants and my necessities. I had removed to the house of a woman whose\nhusband, when living, was master of a trading-vessel, and there I had\nonly lodging and breakfast. Those were heavy, dark days for me.",
        "The lady believed that I went out to dine with various families, whilst\nI only ate a little bread on one of the benches in the royal garden.\nVery rarely did I venture into some of the lowest eating-houses, and\nchoose there the least expensive dish. I was, in truth, very forlorn;\nbut I did not feel the whole weight of my condition. Every person who\nspoke to me kindly I took for a faithful friend. God was with me in my\nlittle room; and many a night, when I have said my evening prayer, I\nasked of Him, like a child, “Will things soon be better with me?” I had\nthe notion, that as it went with me on New Year’s Day, so would it go\nwith me through the whole year; and my highest wishes were to obtain a\npart in a play.",
        "It was now New Year’s Day. The theatre was closed, and only a half-\nblind porter sat at the entrance to the stage, on which there was not a\nsoul. I stole past him with beating heart, got between the movable\nscenes and the curtain, and advanced to the open part of the stage.\nHere I fell down upon my knees, but not a single verse for declamation\ncould I recall to my memory. I then said aloud the Lord’s Prayer, and\nwent out with the persuasion, that because I had spoken from the stage\non New Year’s Day, I should in the course of the year succeed in\nspeaking still more, as well as in having a part assigned to me.",
        "During the two years of my residence in Copenhagen I had never been out\ninto the open country. Once only had I been in the park, and there I\nhad been deeply engrossed by studying the diversions of the people and\ntheir gay tumult. In the spring of the third year, I went out for the\nfirst time amid the verdure of a spring morning. It was into the garden\nof the Fredericksberg, the summer residence of Frederick VI. I stood\nstill suddenly under the first large budding beech tree. The sun made\nthe leaves transparent–there was a fragrance, a freshness–the birds\nsang. I was overcome by it–I shouted aloud for joy, threw my arms\naround the tree and kissed it.",
        "“Is he mad?” said a man close behind me. It was one of the servants of\nthe castle. I ran away, shocked at what I had heard, and then went\nthoughtfully and calmly back to the city.",
        "My voice had, in the mean time, in part regained its richness. The\nsinging master of the choir-school heard it, offered me a place in the\nschool, thinking that, by singing with the choir, I should acquire\ngreater freedom in the exercise of my powers on the stage. I thought\nthat I could see by this means a new way opened for me. I went from the\ndancing-school into the singing-school, and entered the choir, now as a\nshepherd, and now as a warrior. The theatre was my world. I had\npermission to go in the pit, and thus it fared ill with my Latin. I\nheard many people say that there was no Latin required for singing in\nthe choir, and that without the knowledge of this language it was\npossible to become a great actor. I thought there was good sense in\nthat, and very often, either with or without reason, excused myself\nfrom my Latin evening lesson. Guldberg became aware of this, and for\nthe first time I received a reprimand which almost crushed me to the\nearth. I fancy that no criminal could suffer more by hearing the\nsentence of death pronounced upon him. My distress of mind must have\nexpressed itself in my countenance, for he said “Do not act any more\ncomedy.” But it was no comedy to me.",
        "I was now to learn Latin no longer. I felt my dependence upon the\nkindness of others in such a degree as I had never done before.\nOccasionally I had had gloomy and earnest thoughts in looking forward\nto my future, because I was in want of the very necessaries of life; at\nother times I had the perfect thoughtlessness of a child.",
        "The widow of the celebrated Danish statesman, Christian Colbj÷rnsen,\nand her daughter, were the first ladies of high rank who cordially\nbefriended the poor lad; who listened to me with sympathy, and saw me\nfrequently. Mrs. von Colbj÷rnsen resided, during the summer, at\nBakkehus, where also lived the poet Rahbek and his interesting wife.\nRahbek never spoke to me; but his lively and kind-hearted wife often\namused herself with me. I had at that time again begun to write a\ntragedy, which I read aloud to her. Immediately on hearing the first\nscenes, she exclaimed, “But you have actually taken whole passages out\nof Oehlenschl ger and Ingemann.”",
        "“Yes, but they are so beautiful!” replied I in my simplicity, and read\non.",
        "One day, when I was going from her to Mrs. von Colbj÷rnsen, she gave me\na handful of roses, and said, “Will you take them up to her? It will\ncertainly give her pleasure to receive them from the hand of a poet.\"\nThese words were said half in jest; but it was the first time that\nanybody had connected my name with that of poet. It went through me,\nbody and soul, and tears filled my eyes. I know that, from this very\nmoment, my mind was awoke to writing and poetry. Formerly it had been\nmerely an amusement by way of variety from my puppet-theatre.",
        "At Bakkehus lived also Professor Thiele, a young student at that time,\nbut even then the editor of the Danish popular legends, and known to\nthe public as the solver of Baggesen’s riddle, and as the writer of\nbeautiful poetry. He was possessed of sentiment, true inspiration, and\nheart. He had calmly and attentively watched the unfolding of my mind,\nuntil we now became friends. He was one of the few who, at that time,\nspoke the truth of me, when other people were making themselves merry\nat my expense, and having only eyes for that which was ludicrous in me.\nPeople had called me, in jest, the little orator, and, as such, I was\nan object of curiosity. They found amusement in me, and I mistook every\nsmile for a smile of applause. One of my later friends has told me that\nit probably was about this period that he saw me for the first time. It\nwas in the drawing-room of a rich tradesman, where people were making\nthemselves very merry with me. They desired me to repeat one of my\npoems, and, as I did this with great feeling, the merriment was changed\ninto sympathy with me.",
        "I heard it said every day, what a good thing it would be for me if I\ncould study. People advised me to devote myself to science, but no one\nmoved one step to enable me to do so; it was labor enough for me to\nkeep body and soul together. It therefore occurred to me to write a\ntragedy, which I would offer to the Theatre Royal, and would then begin\nto study with the money which I should thus obtain. Whilst Guldberg\ninstructed me in Danish, I had written a tragedy from a German story,\ncalled The Chapel in the Wood; yet as this was done merely as an\nexercise in the language, and, as he forbade me in the most decided\nmanner to bring it out, I would not do so. I originated my own\nmaterial, therefore; and within fourteen days I wrote my national\ntragedy called the Robbers in Wissenberg (the name of a little village\nin Funen.) There was scarcely a word in it correctly written, as I had\nno person to help me, because I meant it to be anonymous; there was,\nnevertheless, one person admitted into the secret, namely, the young\nlady whom I had met with in Odense, during my preparation for\nconfirmation, the only one who at that time showed me kindness and\ngood-will. It was through her that I was introduced to the Colbj÷rnsen\nfamily, and thus known and received in all those circles of which the\none leads into the other. She paid some one to prepare a legible copy\nof my piece, and undertook to present it for perusal. After an interval\nof six weeks, I received it back, accompanied by a letter which said\nthe people did not frequently wish to retain works which betrayed, in\nso great a degree, a want of elementary knowledge.",
        "It was just at the close of the theatrical season, in May, 1823, that I\nreceived a letter from the directors, by which I was dismissed from the\nsinging and dancing school, the letter adding also, that my\nparticipation in the school-teaching could lead to no advantage for me,\nbut that they wished some of my many friends would enable me to receive\nan education, without which, talent availed nothing. I felt myself\nagain, as it were, cast out into the wide world without help and\nwithout support. It was absolutely necessary that I should write a\npiece for the theatre, and that must be accepted; there was no\nother salvation for me. I wrote, therefore, a tragedy founded on a\npassage in history, and I called it Alfsol. I was delighted with the\nfirst act, and with this I immediately went to the Danish translator of\nShakspeare, Admiral Wulff, now deceased, who good-naturedly heard me\nread it. In after years I met with the most cordial reception in his\nfamily. At that time I also introduced myself to our celebrated\nphysician Oersted, and his house has remained to me to this day an\naffectionate home, to which my heart has firmly attached itself, and\nwhere I find my oldest and most unchangeable friends.",
        "A favorite preacher, the rural dean Gutfeldt, was living at that time,\nand he it was who exerted himself most earnestly for my tragedy, which\nwas now finished; and having written a letter of recommendation, he\nsent it to the managers of the theatre. I was suspended between hope\nand fear. In the course of the summer I endured bitter want, but I told\nit to no one, else many a one, whose sympathy I had experienced, would\nhave helped me to the utmost of their means. A false shame prevented me\nfrom confessing what I endured. Still happiness filled my heart. I read\nthen for the first time the works of Walter Scott. A new world was\nopened to me: I forgot the reality, and gave to the circulating library\nthat which should have provided me with a dinner.",
        "The present conference councillor, Collin, one of the most\ndistinguished men of Denmark, who unites with the greatest ability the\nnoblest and best heart, to whom I looked up with confidence in all\nthings, who has been a second father to me, and in whose children I\nhave found brothers and sisters;–this excellent man I saw now for the\nfirst time. He was at that time director of the Theatre Royal, and\npeople universally told me that it would be the best thing for me if he\nwould interest himself on my behalf: it was either Oersted or Gutfeldt\nwho first mentioned me to him; and now for the first time I went to\nthat house which was to become so dear to me. Before the ramparts of\nCopenhagen were extended, this house lay outside the gate, and served\nas a summer residence to the Spanish Ambassador; now, however, it\nstands, a crooked, angular frame-work building, in a respectable\nstreet; an old-fashioned wooden balcony leads to the entrance, and a\ngreat tree spreads its green branches over the court and its pointed\ngables. It was to become a paternal house to me. Who does not willingly\nlinger over the description of home?",
        "I discovered only the man of business in Collin; his conversation was\ngrave and in few words. I went away, without expecting any sympathy\nfrom this man; and yet it was precisely Collin who in all sincerity\nthought for my advantage, and who worked for it silently, as he had\ndone for others, through the whole course of his active life. But at\nthat time I did not understand the apparent calmness with which he\nlistened, whilst his heart bled for the afflicted, and he always\nlabored for them with zeal and success, and knew how to help them. He\ntouched so lightly upon my tragedy, which had been sent to him, and on\naccount of which many people had overwhelmed me with flattering\nspeeches, that I regarded him rather as an enemy than a protector.",
        "In a few day I was sent for by the directors of the theatre, when\nRahbek gave me back my play as useless for the stage; adding, however,\nthat there were so many grains of corn scattered in it, that it was\nhoped, that perhaps, by earnest study, after going to school and the\nprevious knowledge of all that is requisite, I might, some time, be\nable to write a work which should be worthy of being acted on the\nDanish stage.",
        "In order therefore to obtain the means for my support and the necessary\ninstruction, Collin recommended me to King Frederick the Sixth, who\ngranted to me a certain sum annually for some years; and, by means of\nCollin also, the directors of the high schools allowed me to receive\nfree instruction in the grammar school at Slagelse, where just then a\nnew, and, as was said, an active rector was appointed. I was almost\ndumb with astonishment: never had I thought that my life would take\nthis direction, although I had no correct idea of the path which I had\nnow to tread. I was to go with the earliest mail to Slagelse, which lay\ntwelve Danish miles from Copenhagen, to the place where also the poets\nBaggesen and Ingemann had gone to school. I was to receive money\nquarterly from Collin; I was to apply to him in all cases, and he it\nwas who was to ascertain my industry and my progress.",
        "I went to him the second time to express to him my thanks. Mildly and\nkindly he said to me, “Write to me without restraint about everything\nwhich you require, and tell me how it goes with you.” From this hour I\nstruck root in his heart; no father could have been more to me than he\nwas, and is; none could have more heartily rejoiced in my happiness,\nand my after reception with the public; none have shared my sorrow more\nkindly; and I am proud to say that one of the most excellent men which\nDenmark possesses feels towards me as towards his own child. His\nbeneficence was conferred without his making me feel it painful either\nby word or look. That was not the case with every one to whom, in this\nchange of my fortunes, I had to offer my thanks; I was told to think of\nmy inconceivable happiness and my poverty; in Collin’s words was\nexpressed the warm-heartedness of a father, and to him it was that\nproperly I was indebted for everything.",
        "The journey was hastily determined upon, and I had yet for myself some\nbusiness to arrange. I had spoken to an acquaintance from Odense who\nhad the management of a small printing concern, for a widow, to get\n\"Alfsal” printed, that I might, by the sale of the work, make a little\nmoney. Before, however, the piece was printed, it was necessary that I\nshould obtain a certain number of subscribers; but these were not\nobtained, and the manuscript lay in the printing-office, which, at the\ntime I went to fetch it away, was shut up. Some years afterwards,\nhowever, it suddenly made its appearance in print without my knowledge\nor my desire, in its unaltered shape, but without my name.",
        "On a beautiful autumn day I set off with the mail from Copenhagen to\nbegin my school-life in Slagelse. A young student, who a month before\nhad passed his first examination, and now was travelling home to\nJutland to exhibit himself there as a student, and to see once more his\nparents and his friends, sate at my side and exulted for joy over the\nnew life which now lay before him; he assured me that he should be the\nmost unhappy of human beings if he were in my place, and were again\nbeginning to go to the grammar school. But I travelled with a good\nheart towards the little city of Zealand. My mother received a joyful\nletter from me. I only wished that my father and the old grandmother\nyet lived, and could hear that I now went to the grammar school.",
        "When, late in the evening, I arrived at the inn in Slagelse, I asked\nthe hostess if there were anything remarkable in the city.",
        "“Yes,” said she, “a new English fire-engine and Pastor Bastholm’s\nlibrary,” and those probably were all the lions in the city. A few\nofficers of the Lancers composed the fine-gentleman world. Everybody\nknew what was done in everybody’s house, whether a scholar was elevated\nor degraded in his class, and the like. A private theatre, to which, at\ngeneral rehearsal, the scholars of the grammar school and the maid-\nservants of the town had free entrance, furnished rich material for\nconversation. The place was remote from woods, and still farther from\nthe coast; but the great post-road went through the city, and the post-\nhorn resounded from the rolling carriage.",
        "I boarded with a respectable widow of the educated class, and had a\nlittle chamber looking out into the garden and field. My place in the\nschool was in the lowest class, among little boys:–I knew indeed\nnothing at all.",
        "I was actually like a wild bird which is confined in a cage; I had the\ngreatest desire to learn, but for the moment I floundered about, as if\nI had been thrown into the sea; the one wave followed another; grammar,\ngeography, mathematics–I felt myself overpowered by them, and feared\nthat I should never be able to acquire all these. The rector, who took\na peculiar delight in turning everything to ridicule, did not, of\ncourse, make an exception in my case. To me he stood then as a\ndivinity; I believed unconditionally every word which he spoke. One\nday, when I had replied incorrectly to his question, and he said that I\nwas stupid, I mentioned it to Collin, and told him my anxiety, lest I\ndid not deserve all that people had done for me; but he consoled me.\nOccasionally, however, on some subjects of instruction, I began to\nreceive a good certificate, and the teachers were heartily kind to me;\nyet, notwithstanding that I advanced, I still lost confidence in myself\nmore and more. On one of the first examinations, however, I obtained\nthe praise of the rector. He wrote the same in my character-book; and,\nhappy in this, I went a few days afterwards to Copenhagen. Guldberg,\nwho saw the progress I had made, received me kindly, and commended my\nzeal; and his brother in Odense furnished me the next summer with the\nmeans of visiting the place of my birth, where I had not been since I\nleft it to seek adventures. I crossed the Belt, and went on foot to\nOdense. When I came near enough to see the lofty old church tower, my\nheart was more and more affected; I felt deeply the care of God for me,\nand I burst into tears. My mother rejoiced over me. The families of\nIversen and Guldberg received me cordially; and in the little streets I\nsaw the people open their windows to look after me, for everybody knew\nhow remarkably well things had fared with me; nay, I fancied I actually\nstood upon the pinnacle of fortune, when one of the principal citizens,\nwho had built a high tower to his house, led me up there, and I looked\nout thence over the city, and the surrounding country, and some old\nwomen in the hospital below, who had known me from childhood, pointed\nup to me.",
        "As soon, however, as I returned to Slagelse, this halo of glory\nvanished, as well as every thought of it. I may freely confess that I\nwas industrious, and I rose, as soon as it was possible, into a higher\nclass; but in proportion as I rose did I feel the pressure upon me more\nstrongly, and that my endeavors were not sufficiently productive. Many\nan evening, when sleep overcame me, did I wash my head with cold water,\nor run about the lonely little garden, till I was again wakeful, and\ncould comprehend the book anew. The rector filled up a portion of his\nhours of teaching with jests, nicknames, and not the happiest of\nwitticisms. I was as if paralyzed with anxiety when he entered the\nroom, and from that cause my replies often expressed the opposite of\nthat which I wished to say, and thereby my anxiety was all the more\nincreased. What was to become of me?",
        "In a moment of ill-humor I wrote a letter to the head master, who was\none of those who was most cordially opposed to me. I said in this\nletter that I regarded myself as a person so little gifted by nature,\nthat it was impossible for me to study, and that the people in\nCopenhagen threw away the money which they spent upon me: I besought\nhim therefore to counsel me what I should do. The excellent man\nstrengthened me with mild words, and wrote to me a most friendly and\nconsolatory letter; he said that the rector meant kindly by me–that it\nwas his custom and way of acting–that I was making all the progress\nthat people could expect from me, and that I need not doubt of my\nabilities. He told me that he himself was a peasant youth of three and\ntwenty, older than I myself was, when he began his studies; the\nmisfortune for me was, that I ought to have been treated differently to\nthe other scholars, but that this could hardly be done in a school; but\nthat things were progressing, and that I stood well both with the\nteachers and my fellow students.",
        "Every Sunday we had to attend the church and hear an old preacher; the\nother scholars learned their lessons in history and mathematics while\nhe preached; I learned my task in religion, and thought that, by so\ndoing, it was less sinful. The general rehearsals at the private\ntheatre were points of light in my school life; they took place in a\nback building, where the lowing of the cows might be heard; the street-\ndecoration was a picture of the marketplace of the city, by which means\nthe representation had something familiar about it; it amused the\ninhabitants to see their own houses.",
        "On Sunday afternoons it was my delight to go to the castle of\nAntvorskov, at that time only half ruinous, and once a monastery, where\nI pursued the excavating of the ruined cellars, as if it had been a\nPompeii. I also often rambled to the crucifix of St. Anders, which\nstands upon one of the heights of Slagelse, and which is one of the\nwooden crosses erected in the time of Catholicism in Denmark. St.\nAnders was a priest in Slagelse, and travelled to the Holy Land; on the\nlast day he remained so long praying on the holy grave, that the ship\nsailed away without him. Vexed at this circumstance, he walked along\nthe shore, where a man met him riding on an ass, and took him up with\nhim. Immediately he fell asleep, and when he awoke he heard the bells\nof Slagelse ringing. He lay upon the (Hvileh÷i) hill of rest, where the\ncross now stands. He was at home a year and a day before the ship\nreturned, which had sailed away without him, and an angel had borne him\nhome. The legend, and the place where he woke, were both favorites of\nmine. From this spot I could see the ocean and Funen. Here I could\nindulge my fancies; when at home, my sense of duty chained my thoughts\nonly to my books.",
        "The happiest time, however, was when, once on a Sunday, whilst the wood\nwas green, I went to the city of Sor÷, two (Danish) miles from\nSlagelse, and which lies in the midst of woods, surrounded by lakes.\nHere is an academy for the nobility, founded by the poet Holberg.\nEverything lay in a conventual stillness. I visited here the poet\nIngemann, who had just married, and who held a situation as teacher; he\nhad already received me kindly in Copenhagen; but here his reception of\nme was still more kind. His life in this place seemed to me like a\nbeautiful story; flowers and vines twined around his window; the rooms\nwere adorned with the portraits of distinguished poets, and other\npictures. We sailed upon the lake with an Aeolian harp made fast to the\nmast. Ingemann talked so cheerfully, and his excellent, amiable wife\ntreated me as if she were an elder sister:–I loved these people. Our\nfriendship has grown with years. I have been from that time almost\nevery summer a welcome guest there, and I have experienced that there\nare people in whose society one is made better, as it were; that which\nis bitter passes away, and the whole world appears in sunlight.",
        "Among the pupils in the academy of nobles, there were two who made\nverses; they knew that I did the same, and they attached themselves to\nme. The one was Petit, who afterwards, certainly with the best\nintention, but not faithfully, translated several of my books; the\nother, the poet Karl Bagger, one of the most gifted of men who has come\nforward in Danish literature, but who has been unjustly judged. His\npoems are full of freshness and originality; his story, “The Life of my\nBrother,” is a genial book, by the critique on which the Danish Monthly\nReview of Literature has proved that it does not understand how to give\njudgment. These two academicians were very different from me: life\nrushed rejoicingly through their veins; I was sensitive and childlike.\nIn my character-book I always received, as regarded my conduct,\n\"remarkably good.” On one occasion, however, I only obtained the\ntestimony of “very good;” and so anxious and childlike was I, that I\nwrote a letter to Collin on that account, and assured him in grave\nearnestness, that I was perfectly innocent, although I had only\nobtained a character of “very good.”",
        "The rector grew weary of his residence in Slagelse; he applied for the\nvacant post of rector in the grammar-school of Helsing÷r, and obtained\nit. He told me of it, and added kindly, that I might write to Collin\nand ask leave to accompany him thither; that I might live in his house,\nand could even now remove to his family; I should then in half a year\nbecome a student, which could not be the case if I remained behind, and\nthat then he would himself give me some private lessons in Latin and\nGreek. On this same occasion he wrote also to Collin; and this letter,\nwhich I afterwards saw, contained the greatest praise of my industry,\nof the progress I had made, and of my good abilities, which last I\nimagined that he thoroughly mistook, and for the want of which, I\nmyself had so often wept. I had no conception that he judged of me so\nfavorably; it would have strengthened and relieved me had I known it;\nwhereas, on the contrary, his perpetual blame depressed me. I, of\ncourse, immediately received Collin’s permission, and removed to the\nhouse of the rector. But that, alas! was an unfortunate house.",
        "I accompanied him to Helsing÷r, one of the loveliest places in Denmark,\nclose to the Sound, which is at this place not above a mile (Danish)\nbroad, and which seems like a blue, swelling river between Denmark and\nSweden. The ships of all nations sail past daily by hundreds; in winter\nthe ice forms a firm bridge between the two countries, and when in\nspring this breaks up, it resembles a floating glacier. The scenery\nhere made a lively impression upon me, but I dared only to cast stolen\nglances at it. When the school hours were over, the house door was\ncommonly locked; I was obliged to remain in the heated school-room and\nlearn my Latin, or else play with the children, or sit in my little\nroom; I never went out to visit anybody. My life in this family\nfurnishes the most evil dreams to my remembrance. I was almost overcome\nby it, and my prayer to God every evening was, that he would remove\nthis cup from me and let me die. I possessed not an atom of confidence\nin myself. I never mentioned in my letters how hard it went with me,\nbecause the rector found his pleasure in making a jest of me, and\nturning my feelings to ridicule. I never complained of any one, with\nthe exception of myself. I knew that they would say in Copenhagen, “He\nhas not the desire to do any thing; a fanciful being can do no good\nwith realities.”",
        "My letters to Collin, written at this time, showed such a gloomy\ndespairing state of mind, that they touched him deeply; but people\nimagined that was not to be helped; they fancied that it was my\ndisposition, and not, as was the case, that it was the consequence of\noutward influences. My temper of mind was thoroughly buoyant, and\nsusceptible of every ray of sunshine; but only on one single holiday in\nthe year, when I could go to Copenhagen, was I able to enjoy it.",
        "What a change it was to get for a few days out of the rector’s rooms\ninto a house in Copenhagen, where all was elegance, cleanliness, and\nfull of the comforts of refined life! This was at Admiral Wulff’s,\nwhose wife felt for me the kindness of a mother, and whose children met\nme with cordiality; they dwelt in a portion of the Castle of\nAmalienburg, and my chamber looked out into the square. I remember the\nfirst evening there; Aladdin’s words passed through my mind, when he\nlooked down from his splendid castle into the square, and said, “Here\ncame I as a poor lad.” My soul was full of gratitude.",
        " During my whole residence in Slagelse I had scarcely written more than\nfour or five poems; two of which, “The Soul,” and “To my Mother,” will\nbe found printed in my collected works. During my school-time at\nHelsing÷r I wrote only one single poem, “The Dying Child;” a poem\nwhich, of all my after works, became most popular and most widely\ncirculated. I read it to some acquaintance in Copenhagen; some were\nstruck by it, but most of them only remarked my Funen dialect, which\ndrops the d in every word. I was commended by many; but from the\ngreater number I received a lecture on modesty, and that I should not\nget too great ideas of myself–I who really at that time thought\nnothing of myself. [Footnote: How beautifully is all this part of the\nauthor’s experience reflected in that of Antonio, the Improvisatore,\nwhose highly sensitive nature was too often wounded by the well-meant\nlectures of patrons and common-place minds.–M. H.]",
        "At the house of Admiral Wulff I saw many men of the most distinguished\ntalent, and among them all my mind paid the greatest homage to one–\nthat was the poet Adam Oehlenschl ger. I heard his praise resound from\nevery mouth around me; I looked up to him with the most pious faith: I\nwas happy when one evening, in a large brilliantly-lighted drawing\nroom–where I deeply felt that my apparel was the shabbiest there, and\nfor that reason I concealed myself behind the long curtains–\nOehlenschl ger came to me and offered me his hand. I could have fallen\nbefore him on my knees. I again saw Weyse, and heard him improvise upon\nthe piano. Wulff himself read aloud his translations of Byron; and\nOehlenschl ger’s young daughter Charlotte surprised me by her joyous,\nmerry humor.",
        "From such a house as this, I, after a few days, returned to the rector,\nand felt the difference deeply. He also came direct from Copenhagen,\nwhere he had heard it said that I had read in company one of my own\npoems. He looked at me with a penetrating glance, and commanded me to\nbring him the poem, when, if he found in it one spark of poetry, he\nwould forgive me. I tremblingly brought to him “The Dying Child;” he\nread it, and pronounced it to be sentimentality and idle trash. He gave\nway freely to his anger. If he had believed that I wasted my time in\nwriting verses, or that I was of a nature which required a severe\ntreatment, then his intention would have been good; but he could not\npretend this. But from this day forward my situation was more\nunfortunate than ever; I suffered so severely in my mind that I was\nvery near sinking under it. That was the darkest, the most unhappy time\nin my life.",
        "Just then one of the masters went to Copenhagen, and related to Collin\nexactly what I had to bear, and immediately he removed me from the\nschool and from the rector’s house. When, in taking leave of him, I\nthanked him for the kindness which I had received from him, the\npassionate man cursed me, and ended by saying that I should never\nbecome a student, that my verses would grow mouldy on the floor of the\nbookseller’s shop, and that I myself should end my days in a mad-house.\nI trembled to my innermost being, and left him.",
        "Several years afterwards, when my writings were read, when the\nImprovisatore first came out, I met him in Copenhagen; he offered me\nhis hand in a conciliatory manner, and said that he had erred\nrespecting me, and had treated me wrong; but it now was all the same to\nme. The heavy, dark days had also produced their blessing in my life. A\nyoung man, who afterwards became celebrated in Denmark for his zeal in\nthe Northern languages and in history, became my teacher. I hired a\nlittle garret; it is described in the Fiddler; and in The Picture Book\nwithout Pictures, people may see that I often received there visits\nfrom the moon. I had a certain sum allowed for my support; but as\ninstruction was to be paid for, I had to make savings in other ways. A\nfew families through the week-days gave me a place at their tables. I\nwas a sort of boarder, as many another poor student in Copenhagen is\nstill: there was a variety in it; it gave an insight into the several\nkinds of family life, which was not without its influence on me. I\nstudied industriously; in some particular branches I had considerably\ndistinguished myself in Helsing÷r, especially in mathematics; these\nwere, therefore, now much more left to myself: everything tended to\nassist me in my Greek and Latin studies; in one direction, however, and\nthat the one in which it would least have been expected, did my\nexcellent teacher find much to do; namely, in religion. He closely\nadhered to the literal meaning of the Bible; with this I was\nacquainted, because from my first entrance in the school I had clearly\nunderstood what was said and taught by it. I received gladly, both with\nfeeling and understanding, the doctrine, that God is love: everything\nwhich opposed this–a burning hell, therefore, whose fire endured\nforever–I could not recognize. Released from the distressing existence\nof the school-bench, I now expressed myself like a free man; and my\nteacher, who was one of the noblest and most amiable of human beings,\nbut who adhered firmly to the letter, was often quite distressed about\nme. We disputed, whilst pure flames kindled within our hearts. It was\nnevertheless good for me that I came to this unspoiled, highly-gifted\nyoung man, who was possessed of a nature as peculiar as my own.",
        "That which, on the contrary, was an error in me, and which became very\nperceptible, was a pleasure which I had, not in jesting with, but in\nplaying with my best feelings, and in regarding the understanding as\nthe most important thing in the world. The rector had completely\nmistaken my undisguisedly candid and sensitive character; my excitable\nfeelings were made ridiculous, and thrown back upon themselves; and\nnow, when I could freely advance upon the way to my object, this change\nshowed itself in me. From severe suffering I did not rush into\nlibertinism, but into an erroneous endeavor to appear other than I was.\nI ridiculed feeling, and fancied that I had quite thrown it aside; and\nyet I could be made wretched for a whole day, if I met with a sour\ncountenance where I expected a friendly one. Every poem which I had\nformerly written with tears, I now parodied, or gave to it a ludicrous\nrefrain; one of which I called “The Lament of the Kitten,” another,\n\"The Sick Poet.” The few poems which I wrote at that time were all of a\nhumorous character: a complete change had passed over me; the stunted\nplant was reset, and now began to put forth new shoots.",
        "Wulff’s eldest daughter, a very clever and lively girl, understood and\nencouraged the humor, which made itself evident in my few poems; she\npossessed my entire confidence; she protected me like a good sister,\nand had great influence over me, whilst she awoke in me a feeling for\nthe comic.",
        "At this time, also, a fresh current of life was sent through the Danish\nliterature; for this the people had an interest, and politics played no\npart in it.",
        "Heiberg, who had gained the acknowledged reputation of a poet by his\nexcellent works, “Psyche” and “Walter the Potter,” had introduced the\nvaudeville upon the Danish stage; it was a Danish vaudeville, blood of\nour blood, and was therefore received with acclamation, and supplanted\nalmost everything else. Thalia kept carnival on the Danish stage, and\nHeiberg was her secretary. I made his acquaintance first at Oersted’s.\nRefined, eloquent, and the hero of the day, he pleased me in a high\ndegree; he was most kind to me, and I visited him; he considered one of\nmy humorous poems worthy of a place in his most excellent weekly paper,\n\"The Flying Post.” Shortly before I had, after a deal of trouble, got\nmy poem of “The Dying Child” printed in a paper; none of the many\npublishers of journals, who otherwise accept of the most lamentable\ntrash, had the courage to print a poem by a schoolboy. My best known\npoem they printed at that time, accompanied by an excuse for it.\nHeiberg saw it, and gave it in his paper an honorable place. Two\nhumorous poems, signed H., were truly my d but with him.",
        "I remember the first evening when the “Flying Post” appeared with my\nverses in it. I was with a family who wished me well, but who regarded\nmy poetical talent as quite insignificant, and who found something to\ncensure in every line. The master of the house entered with the “Flying\nPost” in his hand.",
        "“This evening,” said he, “there are two excellent poems: they are by\nHeiberg; nobody else could write anything like them.” And now my poems\nwere received with rapture. The daughter, who was in my secret,\nexclaimed, in her delight, that I was the author. They were all struck\ninto silence, and were vexed. That wounded me deeply.",
        "One of our least esteemed writers, but a man of rank, who was very\nhospitable, gave me one day a seat at his table. He told me that a new\nyear’s gift would come out, and that he was applied to for a\ncontribution. I said that a little poem of mine, at the wish of the\npublisher, would appear in the same new year’s gift.",
        "“What, then, everybody and anybody are to contribute to this book!\"\nsaid the man in vexation: “then he will need nothing from me; I\ncertainly can hardly give him anything.”",
        "My teacher dwelt at a considerable distance from me. I went to him\ntwice each day, and on the way there my thoughts were occupied with my\nlessons. On my return, however, I breathed more freely, and then bright\npoetical ideas passed through my brain, but they were never committed\nto paper; only five or six humorous poems were written in the course of\nthe year, and these disturbed me less when they were laid to rest on\npaper than if they had remained in my mind.",
        "In September, 1828, I was a student; and when the examination was over,\nthe thousand ideas and thoughts, by which I was pursued on the way to\nmy teacher, flew like a swarm of bees out into the world, and, indeed,\ninto my first work, “A Journey on Foot to Amack;” a peculiar, humorous\nbook, but one which fully exhibited my own individual character at that\ntime, my disposition to sport with everything, and to jest in tears\nover my own feelings–a fantastic, gaily-colored tapestry-work. No\npublisher had the courage to bring out that little book; I therefore\nventured to do it myself, and, in a few days after its appearance, the\nimpression was sold. Publisher Keitzel bought from me the second\nedition; after a while he had a third; and besides this, the work was\nreprinted in Sweden.",
        "Everybody read my book; I heard nothing but praise; I was “a student,\"\n–I had attained the highest goal of my wishes. I was in a whirl of joy;\nand in this state I wrote my first dramatic work, “Love on the Nicholas\nTower, or, What says the Pit?” It was unsuccessful, because it\nsatirized that which no longer existed amongst us, namely, the shows of\nthe middle ages; besides which, it rather ridiculed the enthusiasm for\nthe vaudeville. The subject of it was, in short, as follows:–The\nwatchman of the Nicholas Tower, who always spoke as a knight of the\ncastle, wished to give his daughter to the watchman of the neighboring\nchurch-tower; but she loved a young tailor, who had made a journey to\nthe grave of Eulenspiegel, and was just now returned, as the punch-bowl\nsteamed, and was to be emptied in honor of the young lady’s consent\nbeing given. The lovers escape together to the tailor’s herberg, where\ndancing and merriment are going forward. The watchman, however, fetches\nback his daughter; but she had lost her senses, and she assured them\nthat she never would recover them, unless she had her tailor. The old\nwatchman determines that Fate should decide the affair; but, then, who\nwas Fate? The idea then comes into his head that the public shall be\nhis Pythia, and that the public shall decide whether she should have\nthe tailor or the watchman. They determine, therefore, to send to one\nof the youngest of the poets, and beg him to write the history in the\nstyle of the vaudeville, a kind of writing which was the most\nsuccessful at that time, and when the piece was brought upon the stage,\nand the public either whistled or hissed, it should be in no wise\nconsidered that the work of the young author had been unsuccessful, but\nthat it should be the voice of Fate, which said, “She shall marry the\nwatchman.” If, on the contrary, the piece was successful, it indicated\nthat she should have the tailor; and this last, remarked the father,\nmust be said in prose, in order that the public may understand it. Now\nevery one of the characters thought himself on the stage, where in the\nepilogue the lovers besought the public for their applause, whilst the\nwatchman begged them either to whistle, or at least to hiss.",
        "My fellow students received the piece with acclamation; they were proud\nof me. I was the second of their body who in this year had brought out\na piece on the Danish stage; the other was Arnesen, student at the same\ntime with me, and author of a vaudeville called “The Intrigue in the\nPeople’s Theatre,” a piece which had a great run. We were the two young\nauthors of the October examination, two of the sixteen poets which this\nyear produced, and whom people in jest divided into the four great and\nthe twelve small poets.",
        "I was now a happy human being; I possessed the soul of a poet, and the\nheart of youth; all houses began to be open to me; I flew from circle\nto circle. Still, however, I devoted myself industriously to study, so\nthat in September, 1829, I passed my Examen philologicum et\nphilosophicum, and brought out the first collected edition of my\npoems, which met with great praise. Life lay bright with sunshine\nbefore me.",
        "Until now I had only seen a small part of my native land, that is to\nsay, a few points in Funen and Zealand, as well as Moen’s Klint, which\nlast is truly one of our most beautiful places; the beechwoods there\nhang like a garland over the white chalk cliffs, from which a view is\nobtained far over the Baltic. I wished, therefore, in the summer of\n1830, to devote my first literary proceeds to seeing Jutland, and\nmaking myself more thoroughly acquainted with my own Funen. I had no\nidea how much solidity of mind I should derive from this summer\nexcursion, or what a change was about to take place in my inner life.",
        "Jutland, which stretches between the German Ocean and the Baltic, until\nit ends at Skagen in a reef of quicksands, possesses a peculiar\ncharacter. Towards the Baltic extend immense woods and hills; towards\nthe North Sea, mountains and quicksands, scenery of a grand and\nsolitary character; and between the two, infinite expanses of brown\nheath, with their wandering gipsies, their wailing birds, and their\ndeep solitude, which the Danish poet, Steen Blicher, has described in\nhis novels.",
        "This was the first foreign scenery which I had ever seen, and the\nimpression, therefore, which it made upon me was very strong.\n[Footnote: This impressive and wild scenery, with its characteristic\nfigures, of gipsies etc., is most exquisitely introduced into the\nauthor’s novel of “O. T.\"; indeed it gives a coloring and tone to the\nwhole work, which the reader never can forget. In my opinion Andersen\nnever wrote anything finer in the way of description than many parts of\nthis work, though as a story it is not equal to his others.–M. H.] In\nthe cities, where my “Journey on Foot” and my comic poems were known, I\nmet with a good reception. Funen revealed her rural life to me; and,\nnot far from my birth-place of Odense, I passed several weeks at the\ncountry seat of the elder Iversen as a welcome guest. Poems sprung\nforth upon paper, but of the comic fewer and fewer. Sentiment, which I\nhad so often derided, would now be avenged. I arrived, in the course of\nmy journey, at the house of a rich family in a small city; and here\nsuddenly a new world opened before me, an immense world, which yet\ncould be contained in four lines, which I wrote at that time:–",
        "  A pair of dark eyes fixed my sight,\n    They were my world, my home, my delight,\n  The soul beamed in them, and childlike peace,\n    And never on earth will their memory cease.",
        "New plans of life occupied me. I would give up writing poetry,–to what\ncould it lead? I would study theology, and become a preacher; I had\nonly one thought, and that was she. But it was self-delusion:\nshe loved another; she married him. It was not till several years later\nthat I felt and acknowledged that it was best, both for her and for\nmyself, that things had fallen out as they were. She had no idea,\nperhaps, how deep my feeling for her had been, or what an influence it\nproduced in me. She had become the excellent wife of a good man, and a\nhappy mother. God’s blessing rest upon her!",
        "In my “Journey on Foot,” and in most of my writings, satire had been\nthe prevailing characteristic. This displeased many people, who thought\nthat this bent of mind could lead to no good purpose. The critics now\nblamed me precisely for that which a far deeper feeling had expelled\nfrom my breast. A new collection of Poetry, “Fancies and Sketches,\"\nwhich was published for the new year, showed satisfactorily what my\nheart suffered. A paraphrase of the history of my own heart appeared in\na serious vaudeville, “Parting and Meeting,” with this difference only,\nthat here the love was mutual: the piece was not presented on the stage\ntill five years later.",
        "Among my young friends in Copenhagen at that time was Orla Lehmann, who\nafterwards rose higher in popular favor, on account of his political\nefforts than any man in Denmark. Full of animation, eloquent and\nundaunted, his character of mind was one which interested me also. The\nGerman language was much studied at his father’s; they had received\nthere Heine’s poems, and they were very attractive for young Orla. He\nlived in the country, in the neighborhood of the castle of\nFredericksberg. I went there to see him, and he sang as I came one of\nHeine’s verses, “Thalatta, Thalatta, du eviges Meer.” We read Heine\ntogether; the afternoon and the evening passed, and I was obliged to\nremain there all night; but I had on this evening made the acquaintance\nof a poet, who, as it seemed to me, sang from the soul; he supplanted\nHoffman, who, as might be seen by my “Journey on Foot,” had formerly\nhad the greatest influence on me. In my youth there were only three\nauthors who as it were infused themselves into my blood,–Walter Scott,\nHoffman, and Heine.",
        "I betrayed more and more in my writings an unhealthy turn of mind. I\nfelt an inclination to seek for the melancholy in life, and to linger\non the dark side of things. I became sensitive and thought rather of\nthe blame than the praise which was lavished on me. My late school\neducation, which was forced, and my impulse to become an author whilst\nI was yet a student, make it evident that my first work, the “Journey\non Foot,” was not without grammatical errors. Had I only paid some one\nto correct the press, which was a work I was unaccustomed to, then no\ncharge of this kind could have been brought against me. Now, on the\ncontrary, people laughed at these errors, and dwelt upon them, passing\nover carelessly that in the book which had merit. I know people who\nonly read my poems to find out errors; they noted down, for instance,\nhow often I used the word beautiful, or some similar word. A\ngentleman, now a clergyman, at that time a writer of vaudevilles and a\ncritic, was not ashamed, in a company where I was, to go through\nseveral of my poems in this style; so that a little girl of six years\nold, who heard with amazement that he discovered everything to be\nwrong, took the book, and pointing out the conjunction and,\nsaid, “There is yet a little word about which you have not scolded.” He\nfelt what a reproof lay in the remark of the child; he looked ashamed\nand kissed the little one. All this wounded me; but I had, since my\nschool-days, become somewhat timid, and that caused me to take it all\nquietly: I was morbidly sensitive, and I was good-natured to a fault.\nEverybody knew it, and some were on that account almost cruel to me.\nEverybody wished to teach me; almost everybody said that I was spoiled\nby praise, and therefore they would speak the truth to me. Thus I heard\ncontinually of my faults, the real and the ideal weaknesses. In the\nmean time, however, my feelings burst forth; and then I said that I\nwould become a poet whom they should see honored. But this was regarded\nonly as the crowning mark of the most unbearable vanity; and from house\nto house it was repeated. I was a good man, they said, but one of the\nvainest in existence; and in that very time I was often ready wholly to\ndespair of my abilities, and had, as in the darkest days of my school-\nlife, a feeling, as if my whole talents were a self-deception. I almost\nbelieved so; but it was more than I could bear, to hear the same thing\nsaid, sternly and jeeringly, by others; and if I then uttered a proud,\nan inconsiderate word, it was addressed to the scourge with which I was\nsmitten; and when those who smite are those we love, then do the\nscourges become scorpions.",
        "For this reason Collin thought that I should make a little journey,–\nfor instance, to North Germany,–in order to divert my mind and furnish\nme with new ideas.",
        "In the spring of 1831, I left Denmark for the first time. I saw L bek\nand Hamburg. Everything astonished me and occupied my mind. I saw\nmountains for the first time,–the Harzgebirge. The world expanded so\nastonishingly before me. My good humor returned to me, as to the bird\nof passage. Sorrow is the flock of sparrows which remains behind, and\nbuilds in the nests of the birds of passage. But I did not feel myself\nwholly restored.",
        "In Dresden I made acquaintance with Tieck. Ingemann had given me a\nletter to him. I heard him one evening read aloud one of Shakspeare’s\nplays. On taking leave of him, he wished me a poet’s success, embraced\nand kissed me; which made the deepest impression upon me. The\nexpression of his eyes I shall never forget. I left him with tears, and\nprayed most fervently to God for strength to enable me to pursue the\nway after which my whole soul strove–strength, which should enable me\nto express that which I felt in my soul; and that when I next saw\nTieck, I might be known and valued by him. It was not until several\nyears afterwards, when my later works were translated into German, and\nwell received in his country, that we saw each other again; I felt the\ntrue hand-pressure of him who had given to me, in my second father-\nland, the kiss of consecration.",
        "In Berlin, a letter of Oersted’s procured me the acquaintance of\nChamisso. That grave man, with his long locks and honest eyes, opened\nthe door to me himself, read the letter, and I know not how it was, but\nwe understood each other immediately. I felt perfect confidence in him,\nand told him so, though it was in bad German. Chamisso understood\nDanish; I gave him my poems, and he was the first who translated any of\nthem, and thus introduced me into Germany. It was thus he spoke of me\nat that time in the Morgenblatt: “Gifted with wit, fancy, humor,\nand a national na vet , Andersen has still in his power tones which\nawaken deeper echoes. He understands, in particular, how with perfect\nease, by a few slight but graphic touches, to call into existence\nlittle pictures and landscapes, but which are often so peculiarly local\nas not to interest those who are unfamiliar with the home of the poet.\nPerhaps that which may be translated from him, or which is so already,\nmay be the least calculated to give a proper idea of him.”",
        "Chamisso became a friend for my whole life. The pleasure which he had\nin my later writings may be seen by the printed letters addressed to me\nin the collected edition of his works.",
        "The little journey in Germany had great influence upon me, as my\nCopenhagen friends acknowledged. The impressions of the journey were\nimmediately written down, and I gave them forth under the title of\n\"Shadow Pictures.” Whether I were actually improved or not, there still\nprevailed at home the same petty pleasure in dragging out my faults,\nthe same perpetual schooling of me; and I was weak enough to endure it\nfrom those who were officious meddlers. I seldom made a joke of it; but\nif I did so, it was called arrogance and vanity, and it was asserted\nthat I never would listen to rational people. Such an instructor once\nasked me whether I wrote Dog with a little d;–he had found\nsuch an error of the press in my last work. I replied, jestingly, “Yes,\nbecause I here spoke of a little dog.”",
        "But these are small troubles, people will say. Yes, but they are drops\nwhich wear hollows in the rock. I speak of it here; I feel a necessity\nto do so; here to protest against the accusation of vanity, which,\nsince no other error can be discovered in my private life, is seized\nupon, and even now is thrown at me like an old medal.",
        "From the end of the year 1828, to the beginning of 1839, I maintained\nmyself alone by my writings. Denmark is a small country; but few books\nat that time went to Sweden and Norway; and on that account the profit\ncould not be great. It was difficult for me to pull through,–doubly\ndifficult, because my dress must in some measure accord with the\ncircles into which I went. To produce, and always to be producing, was\ndestructive, nay, impossible. I translated a few pieces for the\ntheatre,–La Quarantaine, and La Reine de seize ans; and\nas, at that time, a young composer of the name of Hartmann, a grandson\nof him who composed the Danish folks-song of “King Christian stood by\nthe tall, tall mast,” wished for text to an opera, I was of course\nready to write it. Through the writings of Hoffman, my attention had\nbeen turned to the masked comedies of Gozzi: I read Il Corvo,\nand finding that it was an excellent subject, I wrote, in a few weeks,\nmy opera-text of the Raven. It will sound strange to the ears of\ncountrymen when I say that I, at that time, recommended Hartmann; that\nI gave my word for it, in my letter to the theatrical directors, for\nhis being a man of talent, who would produce something good. He now\ntakes the first rank among the living Danish composers.",
        "I worked up also Walter Scott’s “Bride of Lammermoor” for another young\ncomposer, Bredal. Both operas appeared on the stage; but I was\nsubjected to the most merciless criticism, as one who had stultified\nthe labors of foreign poets. What people had discovered to be good in\nme before seemed now to be forgotten, and all talent was denied to me.\nThe composer Weyse, my earliest benefactor, whom I have already\nmentioned, was, on the contrary, satisfied in the highest degree with\nmy treatment of these subjects. He told me that he had wished for a\nlong time to compose an opera from Walter Scott’s “Kenilworth.” He now\nrequested me to commence the joint work, and write the text. I had no\nidea of the summary justice which would be dealt to me. I needed money\nto live, and, what still more determined me to it, I felt flattered to\nhave to work with Weyse our most celebrated composer. It delighted me\nthat he, who had first spoken in my favor at Siboni’s house, now, as\nartist, sought a noble connection with me. I had scarcely half finished\nthe text, when I was already blamed for having made use of a well-known\nromance. I wished to give it up; but Weyse consoled me, and encouraged\nme to proceed. Afterwards, before he had finished the music, when I was\nabout to travel abroad, I committed my fate, as regarded the text,\nentirely to his hands. He wrote whole verses of it, and the altered\nconclusion is wholly his own. It was a peculiarity of that singular man\nthat he liked no book which ended sorrowfully. For that reason, Amy\nmust marry Leicester, and Elizabeth say, “Proud England, I am thine.” I\nopposed this at the beginning; but afterwards I yielded, and the piece\nwas really half-created by Weyse. It was brought on the stage, but was\nnot printed, with the exception of the songs. To this followed\nanonymous attacks: the city post brought me letters in which the\nunknown writers scoffed at and derided me. That same year I published a\nnew collection of poetry, “The Twelve Months of the Year;” and this\nbook, though it was afterwards pronounced to contain the greater part\nof my best lyrical poems, was then condemned as bad.",
        "At that time “The Monthly Review of Literature,” though it is now gone\nto its grave, was in its full bloom. At its first appearance, it\nnumbered among its co-workers some of the most distinguished names. Its\nwant, however, was men who were qualified to speak ably on aesthetic\nworks. Unfortunately, everybody fancies himself able to give an opinion\nupon these; but people may write excellently on surgery or pedagogical\nscience, and may have a name in those things, and yet be dolts in\npoetry: of this proofs may be seen. By degrees it became more and more\ndifficult for the critical bench to find a judge for poetical works.\nThe one, however, who, through his extraordinary zeal for writing and\nspeaking, was ready at hand, was the historian and states-councillor\nMolbeck, who played, in our time, so great a part in the history of\nDanish criticism, that I must speak of him rather more fully. He is an\nindustrious collector, writes extremely correct Danish, and his Danish\ndictionary, let him be reproached with whatever want he may, is a most\nhighly useful work; but, as a judge of aesthetic works, he is one-\nsided, and even fanatically devoted to party spirit. He belongs,\nunfortunately, to the men of science, who are only one sixty-fourth of\na poet, and who are the most incompetent judges of aesthetics. He has,\nfor example, by his critiques on Ingemann’s romances, shown how far he\nis below the poetry which he censures. He has himself published a\nvolume of poems, which belong to the common run of books, “A Ramble\nthrough Denmark,” written in the fade, flowery style of those\ntimes, and “A Journey through Germany, France, and Italy,” which seems\nto be made up out of books, not out of life. He sate in his study, or\nin the Royal Library, where he has a post, when suddenly he became\ndirector of the theatre and censor of the pieces sent in. He was\nsickly, one-sided in judgment, and irritable: people may imagine the\nresult. He spoke of my first poems very favorably; but my star soon\nsank for another, who was in the ascendant, a young lyrical poet,\nPaludan M ller; and, as he no longer loved, he hated me. That is the\nshort history; indeed, in the selfsame Monthly Review the very poems\nwhich had formerly been praised were now condemned by the same judge,\nwhen they appeared in a new increased edition. There is a Danish\nproverb, “When the carriage drags, everybody pushes behind;” and I\nproved the truth of it now.",
        "It happened that a new star in Danish literature ascended at this time.\nHeinrich Hertz published his “Letters from the Dead” anonymously: it\nwas a mode of driving all the unclean things out of the temple. The\ndeceased Baggesen sent polemical letters from Paradise, which resembled\nin the highest degree the style of that author. They contained a sort\nof apotheosis of Heiberg, and in part attacks upon Oehlenschl ger and\nHauch. The old story about my orthographical errors was again revived;\nmy name and my school-days in Slagelse were brought into connection\nwith St. Anders.",
        "I was ridiculed, or if people will, I was chastised. Hertz’s book went\nthrough all Denmark; people spoke of nothing but him. It made it still\nmore piquant that the author of the work could not be discovered.\nPeople were enraptured, and justly. Heiberg, in his “Flying Post,\"\ndefended a few aesthetical insignificants, but not me. I felt the wound\nof the sharp knife deeply. My enemies now regarded me as entirely shut\nout from the world of spirits. I however in a short time published a\nlittle book, “Vignettes to the Danish Poets,” in which I characterized\nthe dead and the living authors in a few lines each, but only spoke of\nthat which was good in them. The book excited attention; it was\nregarded as one of the best of my works; it was imitated, but the\ncritics did not meddle with it. It was evident, on this occasion, as\nhad already been the case, that the critics never laid hands on those\nof my works which were the most successful.",
        "My affairs were now in their worst condition; and precisely in that\nsame year in which a stipend for travelling had been conferred upon\nHertz, I also had presented a petition for the same purpose. The\nuniversal opinion was that I had reached the point of culmination, and\nif I was to succeed in travelling it must be at this present time. I\nfelt, what since then has become an acknowledged fact, that travelling\nwould be the best school for me. In the mean time I was told that to\nbring it under consideration I must endeavor to obtain from the most\ndistinguished poets and men of science a kind of recommendation;\nbecause this very year there were so many distinguished young men who\nwere soliciting a stipend, that it would be difficult among these to\nput in an available claim. I therefore obtained recommendations for\nmyself; and I am, so far as I know, the only Danish poet who was\nobliged to produce recommendations to prove that he was a poet.",
        "And here also it is remarkable, that the men who recommended me have\neach one made prominent some very different qualification which gave me\na claim: for instance, Oehlenschl ger, my lyrical power, and the\nearnestness that was in me; Ingemann, my skill in depicting popular\nlife; Heiberg declared that, since the days of Wessel, no Danish poet\nhad possessed so much humor as myself; Oersted remarked, every one,\nthey who were against me as well as those who were for me, agreed on\none subject, and this was that I was a true poet. Thiele\nexpressed himself warmly and enthusiastically about the power which he\nhad seen in me, combating against the oppression and the misery of\nlife. I received a stipend for travelling; Hertz a larger and I a\nsmaller one: and that also was quite in the order of things.",
        "“Now be happy,” said my friends, “make yourself aware of your unbounded\ngood fortune! Enjoy the present moment, as it will probably be the only\ntime in which you will get abroad. You shall hear what people say about\nyou while you are travelling, and how we shall defend you; sometimes,\nhowever, we shall not be able to do that.”",
        "It was painful to me to hear such things said; I felt a compulsion of\nsoul to be away, that I might, if possible, breathe freely; but sorrow\nis firmly seated on the horse of the rider. More than one sorrow\noppressed my heart, and although I opened the chambers of my heart to\nthe world, one or two of them I keep locked, nevertheless. On setting\nout on my journey, my prayer to God was that I might die far away from\nDenmark, or return strengthened for activity, and in a condition to\nproduce works which should win for me and my beloved ones joy and\nhonor.",
        "Precisely at the moment of setting out on my journey, the form of my\nbeloved arose in my heart. Among the few whom I have already named,\nthere are two who exercised a great influence upon my life and my\npoetry, and these I must more particularly mention. A beloved mother,\nan unusually liberal-minded and well educated lady, Madame L ss c, had\nintroduced me into her agreeable circle of friends; she often felt the\ndeepest sympathy with me in my troubles; she always turned my attention\nto the beautiful in nature and the poetical in the details of life, and\nas almost everyone regarded me as a poet, she elevated my mind; yes,\nand if there be tenderness and purity in anything which I have written,\nthey are among those things for which I have especially to be thankful\nto her. Another character of great importance to me was Collin’s son\nEdward. Brought up under fortunate circumstances of life, he was\npossessed of that courage and determination which I wanted. I felt that\nhe sincerely loved me, and I full of affection, threw myself upon him\nwith my whole soul; he passed on calmly and practically through the\nbusiness of life. I often mistook him at the very moment when he felt\nfor me most deeply, and when he would gladly have infused into me a\nportion of his own character,–to me who was as a reed shaken by the\nwind. In the practical part of life, he, the younger, stood actively by\nmy side, from the assistance which he gave in my Latin exercises, to\nthe arranging the business of bringing out editions of my works. He has\nalways remained the same; and were I to enumerate my friends, he would\nbe placed by me as the first on the list. When the traveller leaves the\nmountains behind him, then for the first time he sees them in their\ntrue form: so is it also with friends.",
        "I arrived at Paris by way of Cassel and the Rhine. I retained a vivid\nimpression of all that I saw. The idea for a poem fixed itself firmer\nand firmer in my mind; and I hoped, as it became more clearly worked\nout, to propitiate by it my enemies. There is an old Danish folks-song\nof Agnete and the Merman, which bore an affinity to my own state of\nmind, and to the treatment of which I felt an inward impulse. The song\ntells that Agnete wandered solitarily along the shore, when a merman\nrose up from the waves and decoyed her by his speeches. She followed\nhim to the bottom of the sea, remained there seven years, and bore him\nseven children. One day, as she sat by the cradle, she heard the church\nbells sounding down to her in the depths of the sea, and a longing\nseized her heart to go to church. By her prayers and tears she induced\nthe merman to conduct her to the upper world again, promising soon to\nreturn. He prayed her not to forget his children, more especially the\nlittle one in the cradle; stopped up her ears and her mouth, and then\nled her upwards to the sea-shore. When, however, she entered the\nchurch, all the holy images, as soon as they saw her, a daughter of sin\nand from the depths of the sea, turned themselves round to the walls.\nShe was affrighted, and would not return, although the little ones in\nher home below were weeping.",
        "I treated this subject freely, in a lyrical and dramatic manner. I will\nventure to say that the whole grew out of my heart; all the\nrecollections of our beechwoods and the open sea were blended in it.",
        "In the midst of the excitement of Paris I lived in the spirit of the\nDanish folks-songs. The most heartfelt gratitude to God filled my soul,\nbecause I felt that all which I had, I had received through his mercy;\nyet at the same time I took a lively interest in all that surrounded\nme. I was present at one of the July festivals, in their first\nfreshness; it was in the year 1833. I saw the unveiling of Napoleon’s\npillar. I gazed on the world-experienced King Louis Philippe, who is\nevidently defended by Providence. I saw the Duke of Orleans, full of\nhealth and the enjoyment of life, dancing at the gay people’s ball, in\nthe gay Maison de Ville. Accident led in Paris to my first meeting with\nHeine, the poet, who at that time occupied the throne in my poetical\nworld. When I told him how happy this meeting and his kind words made\nme, he said that this could not very well be the case, else I should\nhave sought him out. I replied, that I had not done so precisely\nbecause I estimated him so highly. I should have feared that he might\nhave thought it ridiculous in me, an unknown Danish poet, to seek him\nout; “and,” added I, “your sarcastic smile would deeply have wounded\nme.” In reply, he said something friendly.",
        "Several years afterwards, when we again met in Paris, he gave me a\ncordial reception, and I had a view into the brightly poetical portion\nof his soul.",
        "Paul D port met me with equal kindness. Victor Hugo also received me.",
        " During my journey to Paris, and the whole month that I spent there, I\nheard not a single word from home. Could my friends perhaps have\nnothing agreeable to tell me? At length, however, a letter arrived; a\nlarge letter, which cost a large sum in postage. My heart beat with joy\nand yearning impatience; it was, indeed, my first letter. I opened it,\nbut I discovered not a single written word, nothing but a Copenhagen\nnewspaper, containing a lampoon upon me, and that was sent to me all\nthat distance with postage unpaid, probably by the anonymous writer\nhimself. This abominable malice wounded me deeply. I have never\ndiscovered who the author was, perhaps he was one of those who\nafterwards called me friend, and pressed my hand. Some men have base\nthoughts: I also have mine.",
        "It is a weakness of my country-people, that commonly, when abroad,\nduring their residence in large cities, they almost live exclusively in\ncompany together; they must dine together, meet at the theatre, and see\nall the lions of the place in company. Letters are read by each other;\nnews of home is received and talked over, and at last they hardly know\nwhether they are in a foreign land or their own. I had given way to the\nsame weakness in Paris; and in leaving it, therefore, determined for\none month to board myself in some quiet place in Switzerland, and live\nonly among the French, so as to be compelled to speak their language,\nwhich was necessary to me in the highest degree.",
        "In the little city of Lodi, in a valley of the Jura mountains, where\nthe snow fell in August, and the clouds floated below us, was I\nreceived by the amiable family of a wealthy watchmaker. They would not\nhear a word about payment. I lived among them and their friends as a\nrelation, and when we parted the children wept. We had become friends,\nalthough I could not understand their patois; they shouted loudly into\nmy ear, because they fancied I must be deaf, as I could not understand\nthem. In the evenings, in that elevated region, there was a repose and\na stillness in nature, and the sound of the evening bells ascended to\nus from the French frontier. At some distance from the city, stood a\nsolitary house, painted white and clean; on descending through two\ncellars, the noise of a millwheel was heard, and the rushing waters of\na river which flowed on here, hidden from the world. I often visited\nthis place in my solitary rambles, and here I finished my poem of\n\"Agnete and the Merman,” which I had begun in Paris.",
        "I sent home this poem from Lodi; and never, with my earlier or my later\nworks, were my hopes so high as they were now. But it was received\ncoldly. People said I had done it in imitation of Oehlenschl ger, who\nat one time sent home masterpieces. Within the last few years, I fancy,\nthis poem has been somewhat more read, and has met with its friends. It\nwas, however, a step forwards, and it decided, as it were,\nunconsciously to me, my pure lyrical phasis. It has been also of late\ncritically adjudged in Denmark, that, notwithstanding that on its first\nappearance it excited far less attention than some of my earlier and\nless successful works, still that in this the poetry is of a deeper,\nfuller, and more powerful character than anything which I had hitherto\nproduced.",
        "This poem closes one portion of my life.",
        "On the 5th of September, 1833, I crossed the Simplon on my way to\nItaly. On the very day, on which, fourteen years before, I had arrived\npoor and helpless in Copenhagen, did I set foot in this country of my\nlonging and of my poetical happiness. It happened in this case, as it\noften does, by accident, without any arrangement on my part, as if I\nhad preordained lucky days in the year; yet good fortune has so\nfrequently been with me, that I perhaps only remind myself of its\nvisits on my own self-elected days.",
        "All was sunshine–all was spring! The vine hung in long trails from\ntree to tree; never since have I seen Italy so beautiful. I sailed on\nLago Maggiore; ascended the cathedral of Milan; passed several days in\nGenoa, and made from thence a journey, rich in the beauties of nature,\nalong the shore to Carrara. I had seen statues in Paris, but my eyes\nwere closed to them; in Florence, before the Venus de Medici, it was\nfor the first time as if scales fell from my eyes; a new world of art\ndisclosed itself before me; that was the first fruit of my journey.\nHere it was that I first learned to understand the beauty of form–the\nspirit which reveals itself in form. The life of the people–nature–\nall was new to me; and yet as strangely familiar as if I were come to a\nhome where I had lived in my childhood. With a peculiar rapidity did I\nseize upon everything, and entered into its life, whilst a deep\nnorthern melancholy–it was not home-sickness, but a heavy, unhappy\nfeeling–filled my breast. I received the news in Rome, of how little\nthe poem of Agnete, which I had sent home, was thought of there; the\nnext letter in Rome brought me the news that my mother was dead. I was\nnow quite alone in the world.",
        "It was at this time, and in Rome, that my first meeting with Hertz took\nplace. In a letter which I had received from Collin, he had said that\nit would give him pleasure to hear that Hertz and I had become friends;\nbut even without this wish it would have happened, for Hertz kindly\noffered me his hand, and expressed sympathy with my sorrow. He had, of\nall those with whom I was at that time acquainted, the most variously\ncultivated mind. We had often disputations together, even about the\nattacks which had been made upon me at home as a poet. He, who had\nhimself given me a wound, said the following words, which deeply\nimpressed themselves on my memory: “Your misfortune is, that you have\nbeen obliged to print everything; the public has been able to follow\nyou step by step. I believe that even, a Goethe himself must have\nsuffered the same fate, had he been in your situation.” And then he\npraised my talent for seizing upon the characteristics of nature, and\ngiving, by a few intuitive sketches, pictures of familiar life. My\nintercourse with him was very instructive to me, and I felt that I had\none merciful judge more. I travelled in company with him to Naples,\nwhere we dwelt together in one house.",
        "In Rome I also became first acquainted with Thorwaldsen. Many years\nbefore, when I had not long been in Copenhagen, and was walking through\nthe streets as a poor boy, Thorwaldsen was there too: that was on his\nfirst return home. We met one another in the street. I knew that he was\na distinguished man in art; I looked at him, I bowed; he went on, and\nthen, suddenly turning round, came back to me, and said, “Where have I\nseen you before? I think we know one another.” I replied, “No, we do\nnot know one another at all.” I now related this story to him in Rome;\nhe smiled, pressed my hand, and said, “Yet we felt at that time that we\nshould become good friends.” I read Agnete to him; and that which\ndelighted me in his judgment upon it was the assertion, “It is just,\"\nsaid he, “as if I were walking at home in the woods, and heard the\nDanish lakes;” and then he kissed me.",
        "One day, when he saw how distressed I was, and I related to him about\nthe pasquinade which I had received from home in Paris, he gnashed his\nteeth violently, and said, in momentary anger, “Yes, yes, I know the\npeople; it would not have gone any better with me if I had remained\nthere; I should then, perhaps, not even have obtained permission to set\nup a model. Thank God that I did not need them, for then they know how\nto torment and to annoy.” He desired me to keep up a good heart, and\nthen things could not fail of going well; and with that he told me of\nsome dark passages in his own life, where he in like manner had been\nmortified and unjustly condemned.",
        "After the Carnival, I left Rome for Naples; saw at Capri the blue\nGrotto, which was at that time first discovered; visited the temple at\nPaestum, and returned in the Easter week to Rome, from whence I went\nthrough Florence and Venice to Vienna and Munich; but I had at that\ntime neither mind nor heart for Germany; and when I thought on Denmark,\nI felt fear and distress of mind about the bad reception which I\nexpected to find there. Italy, with its scenery and its people’s life,\noccupied my soul, and towards this land I felt a yearning. My earlier\nlife, and what I had now seen, blended themselves together into an\nimage–into poetry, which I was compelled to write down, although I was\nconvinced that it would occasion me more trouble than joy, if my\nnecessities at home should oblige me to print it. I had written already\nin Rome the first chapter. It was my novel of “The Improvisatore.”",
        "At one of my first visits to the theatre at Odense, as a little boy,\nwhere, as I have already mentioned, the representations were given in\nthe German language, I saw the Donauweibchen, and the public applauded\nthe actress of the principal part. Homage was paid to her, and she was\nhonored; and I vividly remember thinking how happy she must be.",
        "Many years afterwards, when, as a student, I visited Odense, I saw, in\none of the chambers of the hospital where the poor widows lived and\nwhere one bed stood by another, a female portrait hanging over one bed\nin a gilt frame. It was Lessing’s Emilia Galotti, and represented her\nas pulling the rose to pieces; but the picture was a portrait. It\nappeared singular in contrast with the poverty by which it was\nsurrounded.",
        "“Whom does it represent?” asked I.",
        "“Oh!” said one of the old women, “it is the face of the German lady,\nthe poor lady who once was an actress!” And then I saw a little\ndelicate woman, whose face was covered with wrinkles, and in an old\nsilk gown that once had been black. That was the once celebrated\nSinger, who, as the Donauweibchen, had been applauded by every one.\nThis circumstance made an indelible impression upon me, and often\noccurred to my mind.",
        "In Naples I heard Malibran for the first time. Her singing and acting\nsurpassed anything which I had hitherto either heard or seen; and yet I\nthought the while of the miserably poor singer in the hospital of\nOdense: the two figures blended into the Annunciata of the novel. Italy\nwas the back ground for that which had been experienced and that which\nwas imagined.  In August of 1834 I returned to Denmark. I wrote the\nfirst part of the book at Ingemann’s, in Sor÷, in a little chamber in\nthe roof, among fragrant lime-trees. I finished it in Copenhagen.",
        "At this time my best friends, even, had almost given me up as a poet;\nthey said that they had erred with regard to my talents. It was with\ndifficulty that I found a publisher for the book. I received a\nmiserable sum of money for it, and the “Improvisatore” made its\nappearance; was read, sold out, and again published. The critics were\nsilent; the newspapers said nothing; but I heard all around me of the\ninterest which was felt for the work, and the delight that it\noccasioned. At length the poet Carl Bagger, who was at that time the\neditor of a newspaper, wrote the first critique upon it, and began\nironically, with the customary tirade against me–\"that it was all over\nwith this author, who had already passed his heyday;\"–in short, he\nwent the whole length of the tobacco and tea criticism, in order\nsuddenly to dash out, and to express his extremely warm enthusiasm for\nme; and my book. People now laughed at me, but I wept. This was my mood\nof mind. I wept freely, and felt gratitude to God and man.",
        "“To the Conference Councillor Collin and to his noble wife, in whom I\nfound parents, whose children were brethren and sisters to me, whose\nhouse was my home, do I here present the best of which I am\npossessed.\"–So ran the dedication. Many who formerly had been my\nenemy, now changed their opinion; and among these one became my friend,\nwho, I hope, will remain so through the whole of my life. That was\nHauch the poet, one of the noblest characters with whom I am\nacquainted. He had returned home from Italy after a residence of\nseveral years abroad, just at the time when Heiberg’s vaudevilles were\nintoxicating the inhabitants of Copenhagen, and when my “Journey on\nFoot” was making me a little known. He commenced a controversy with\nHeiberg, and somewhat scoffed at me. Nobody called his attention to my\nbetter lyrical writings; I was described to him as a spoiled, petulant\nchild of fortune. He now read my Improvisatore, and feeling that there\nwas something good in me, his noble character evinced itself by his\nwriting a cordial letter to me, in which he said, that he had done me\nan injustice, and offered me now the hand of reconciliation. From that\ntime we became friends. He used his influence for me with the utmost\nzeal, and has watched my onward career with heartfelt friendship. But\nso little able have many people been to understand what is excellent in\nhim, or the noble connection of heart between us two, that not long\nsince, when he wrote a novel, and drew in it the caricature of a poet,\nwhose vanity ended in insanity, the people in Denmark discovered that\nhe had treated me with the greatest injustice, because he had described\nin it my weakness. People must not believe that this was the assertion\nof one single person, or a misapprehension of my character; no; and\nHauch felt himself compelled to write a treatise upon me as a poet,\nthat he might show what a different place he assigned to me.",
        "But to return to the “Improvisatore.” This book raised my sunken\nfortunes; collected my friends again around me, nay, even obtained for\nme new ones. For the first time I felt that I had obtained a due\nacknowledgment. The book was translated into German by Kruse, with a\nlong title, “Jugendleben und Tr ume eines italienischen\nDichter’s.” I objected to the title; but he declared that it was\nnecessary in order to attract attention to the book.",
        "Bagger had, as already stated, been the first to pass judgment on the\nwork; after an interval of some time a second critique made its\nappearance, more courteous, it is true, than I was accustomed to, but\nstill passing lightly over the best things in the book and dwelling on\nits deficiencies, and on the number of incorrectly written Italian\nwords. And, as Nicolai’s well-known book, “Italy as it really is,” came\nout just then, people universally said, “Now we shall be able to see\nwhat it is about which Andersen has written, for from Nicolai a true\nidea of Italy may be obtained for the first time.”",
        "It was from Germany that resounded the first decided acknowledgment of\nthe merits of my work, or rather perhaps its over estimation. I bow\nmyself in joyful gratitude, like a sick man toward the sunshine, when\nmy heart is grateful. I am not, as the Danish Monthly Review, in its\ncritique of the “Improvisatore,” condescended to assert, an unthankful\nman, who exhibits in his work a want of gratitude towards his\nbenefactors. I was indeed myself poor Antonio who sighed under the\nburden which I had to bear,–I, the poor lad who ate the bread\nof charity. From Sweden also, later, resounded my praise, and the\nSwedish newspapers contained articles in praise of this work, which\nwithin the last two years has been equally warmly received in England,\nwhere Mary Howitt, the poetess, has translated it into English; the\nsame good fortune also is said to have attended the book in Holland and\nRussia. Everywhere abroad resounded the loudest acknowledgments of its\nexcellence.",
        "There exists in the public a power which is stronger than all the\ncritics and cliques. I felt that I stood at home on firmer ground, and\nmy spirit again had moments in which it raised its wings for flight. In\nthis alternation of feeling between gaiety and ill humor, I wrote my\nnext novel, “O. T.,” which is regarded by many persons in Denmark as my\nbest work;–an estimation which I cannot myself award to it. It\ncontains characteristic features of town life. My first Tales appeared\nbefore “O. T;” but this is not the place in which to speak of them. I\nfelt just at this time a strong mental impulse to write, and I believed\nthat I had found my true element in novel-writing. In the following\nyear, 1837, I published “Only a Fiddler,” a book which on my part had\nbeen deeply pondered over, and the details of which sprang fresh to the\npaper. My design was to show that talent is not genius, and that if the\nsunshine of good fortune be withheld, this must go to the ground,\nthough without losing its nobler, better nature. This book likewise had\nits partisans; but still the critics would not vouchsafe to me any\nencouragement; they forgot that with years the boy becomes a man, and\nthat people may acquire knowledge in other than the ordinary ways. They\ncould not separate themselves from their old preconceived opinions.\nWhilst “O. T.” was going through the press it was submitted sheet by\nsheet to a professor of the university, who had himself offered to\nundertake this work, and by two other able men also; notwithstanding\nall this, the Reviews said, “We find the usual grammatical negligence,\nwhich we always find in Andersen, in this work also.” That which\ncontributed likewise to place this book in the shade was the\ncircumstance of Heiberg having at that time published his Every-day\nStories, which were written in excellent language, and with good taste\nand truth. Their own merits, and the recommendation of their being\nHeiberg’s, who was the beaming star of literature, placed them in the\nhighest rank.",
        "I had however advanced so far, that there no longer existed any doubt\nas to my poetical ability, which people had wholly denied to me before\nmy journey to Italy. Still not a single Danish critic had spoken of the\ncharacteristics which are peculiar to my novels. It was not until my\nworks appeared in Swedish that this was done, and then several Swedish\njournals went profoundly into the subject and analyzed my works with\ngood and honorable intentions. The case was the same in Germany; and\nfrom this country too my heart was strengthened to proceed. It was not\nuntil last year that in Denmark, a man of influence, Hauch the poet,\nspoke of the novels in his already mentioned treatise, and with a few\ntouches brought their characteristics prominently forward.",
        "“The principal thing,” says he, “in Andersen’s best and most elaborate\nworks, in those which are distinguished for the richest fancy, the\ndeepest feeling, the most lively poetic spirit, is, of talent, or at\nleast of a noble nature, which will struggle its way out of narrow and\ndepressing circumstances. This is the case with his three novels, and\nwith this purpose in view, it is really an important state of existence\nwhich he describes,–an inner world, which no one understands better\nthan he, who has himself, drained out of the bitter cup of suffering\nand renunciation, painful and deep feelings which are closely related\nto those of his own experience, and from which Memory, who, according\nto the old significant myth, is the mother of the Muses, met him hand\nin hand with them. That which he, in these his works, relates to the\nworld, deserves assuredly to be listened to with attention; because, at\nthe same time that it may be only the most secret inward life of the\nindividual, yet it is also the common lot of men of talent and genius,\nat least when these are in needy circumstances, as is the case of those\nwho are here placed before our eyes. In so far as in his\n’Improvisatore,’ in ’O. T.,’ and in ’Only a Fiddler,’ he represents not\nonly himself, in his own separate individuality, but at the same time\nthe momentous combat which so many have to pass through, and which he\nunderstands so well, because in it his own life has developed itself;\ntherefore in no instance can he be said to present to the reader what\nbelongs to the world of illusion, but only that which bears witness to\ntruth, and which, as is the case with all such testimony, has a\nuniversal and enduring worth.",
        "“And still more than this, Andersen is not only the defender of talent\nand genius, but, at the same time, of every human heart which is\nunkindly and unjustly treated. And whilst he himself has so painfully\nsuffered in that deep combat in which the Laocoon-snakes seize upon the\noutstretched hand; whilst he himself has been compelled to drink from\nthat wormwood-steeped bowl which the cold-blooded and arrogant world so\nconstantly offers to those who are in depressed circumstances, he is\nfully capable of giving to his delineations in this respect a truth and\nan earnestness, nay, even a tragic and a pain-awakening pathos that\nrarely fails of producing its effect on the sympathizing human heart.\nWho can read that scene in his ’Only a Fiddler,’ in which the ’high-\nbred hound,’ as the poet expresses it, ’turned away with disgust from\nthe broken victuals which the poor youth received as alms, without\nrecognizing, at the same time, that this is no game in which vanity\nseeks for a triumph, but that it expresses much more–human nature\nwounded to its inmost depths, which here speaks out its sufferings.’”",
        "Thus is it spoken in Denmark of my works, after an interval of nine or\nten years; thus speaks the voice of a noble, venerated man. It is with\nme and the critics as it is with wine,–the more years pass before it\nis drunk the better is its flavor.",
        "During the year in which “The Fiddler” came out, I visited for the\nfirst time the neighboring country of Sweden. I went by the G÷ta canal\nto Stockholm. At that time nobody understood what is now called\nScandinavian sympathies; there still existed a sort of mistrust\ninherited from the old wars between the two neighbor nations. Little\nwas known of Swedish literature, and there were only very few Danes who\ncould easily read and understand the Swedish language;–people scarcely\nknew Tegn r’s Frithiof and Axel, excepting through translations. I had,\nhowever, read a few other Swedish authors, and the deceased,\nunfortunate Stagnelius pleased me more as a poet than Tegn r, who\nrepresented poetry in Sweden. I, who hitherto had only travelled into\nGermany and southern countries, where by this means, the departure from\nCopenhagen was also the departure from my mother tongue, felt, in this\nrespect, almost at home in Sweden: the languages are so much akin, that\nof two persons each might read in the language of his own country, and\nyet the other understand him. It seemed to me, as a Dane, that Denmark\nexpanded itself; kinship with the people exhibited itself, in many\nways, more and more; and I felt, livingly, how near akin are Swedes,\nDanes, and Norwegians.",
        "I met with cordial, kind people,–and with these I easily made\nacquaintance. I reckon this journey among the happiest I ever made. I\nhad no knowledge of the character of Swedish scenery, and therefore I\nwas in the highest degree astonished by the Trollh tta-voyage, and by\nthe extremely picturesque situation of Stockholm. It sounds to the\nuninitiated half like a fairy-tale, when one says that the steam-boat\ngoes up across the lakes over the mountains, from whence may be seen\nthe outstretched pine and beechwoods below. Immense sluices heave up\nand lower the vessel again, whilst the travellers ramble through the\nwoods. None of the cascades of Switzerland, none in Italy, not even\nthat of Terni, have in them anything so imposing as that of Trollh tta.\nSuch is the impression, at all events, which it made on me.",
        "On this journey, and at this last-mentioned place, commenced a very\ninteresting acquaintance, and one which has not been without its\ninfluence on me,–an acquaintance with the Swedish authoress, Fredrika\nBremer. I had just been speaking with the captain of the steam-boat and\nsome of the passengers about the Swedish authors living in Stockholm,\nand I mentioned my desire to see and converse with Miss Bremer.",
        "“You will not meet with her,” said the Captain, “as she is at this\nmoment on a visit in Norway.”",
        "“She will be coming back while I am there,” said I in joke; “I always\nam lucky in my journeys, and that which I most wish for is always\naccomplished.",
        "“Hardly this time, however,” said the captain.",
        "A few hours after this he came up to me laughing, with the list of the\nnewly arrived passengers in his hand. “Lucky fellow,” said he aloud,\n\"you take good fortune with you; Miss Bremer is here, and sails with us\nto Stockholm.”",
        "I received it as a joke; he showed me the list, but still I was\nuncertain. Among the new arrivals, I could see no one who resembled an\nauthoress. Evening came on, and about midnight we were on the great\nWener lake. At sunrise I wished to have a view of this extensive lake,\nthe shores of which could scarcely be seen; and for this purpose I left\nthe cabin. At the very moment that I did so, another passenger was also\ndoing the same, a lady neither young nor old, wrapped in a shawl and\ncloak. I thought to myself, if Miss Bremer is on board, this must be\nshe, and fell into discourse with her; she replied politely, but still\ndistantly, nor would she directly answer my question, whether she was\nthe authoress of the celebrated novels. She asked after my name; was\nacquainted with it, but confessed that she had read none of my works.\nShe then inquired whether I had not some of them with me, and I lent\nher a copy of the “Improvisatore,” which I had destined for Beskow.\nShe vanished immediately with the volumes, and was not again visible\nall morning.",
        "When I again saw her, her countenance was beaming, and she was full of\ncordiality; she pressed my hand, and said that she had read the greater\npart of the first volume, and that she now knew me.",
        "The vessel flew with us across the mountains, through quiet inland\nlakes and forests, till it arrived at the Baltic Sea, where islands lie\nscattered, as in the Archipelago, and where the most remarkable\ntransition takes place from naked cliffs to grassy islands, and to\nthose on which stand trees and houses. Eddies and breakers make it here\nnecessary to take on board a skilful pilot; and there are indeed some\nplaces where every passenger must sit quietly on his seat, whilst the\neye of the pilot is riveted upon one point. On shipboard one feels the\nmighty power of nature, which at one moment seizes hold of the vessel\nand the next lets it go again.",
        "Miss Bremer related many legends and many histories, which were\nconnected with this or that island, or those farm-premises up aloft on\nthe mainland.",
        "In Stockholm, the acquaintance with her increased, and year after year\nthe letters which have passed between us have strengthened it. She is a\nnoble woman; the great truths of religion, and the poetry which lies in\nthe quiet circumstances of life, have penetrated her being.",
        "It was not until after my visit to Stockholm that her Swedish\ntranslation of my novel came out; my lyrical poems only, and my\n\"Journey on Foot,” were known to a few authors; these received me with\nthe utmost kindness, and the lately deceased Dahlgr n, well known by\nhis humorous poems, wrote a song in my honor–in short, I met with\nhospitality, and countenances beaming with Sunday gladness. Sweden and\nits inhabitants became dear to me. The city itself, by its situation\nand its whole picturesque appearance, seemed to me to emulate Naples.\nOf course, this last has the advantage of fine atmosphere, and the\nsunshine of the south; but the view of Stockholm is just as imposing;\nit has also some resemblance to Constantinople, as seen from Pera, only\nthat the minarets are wanting. There prevails a great variety of\ncoloring in the capital of Sweden; white painted buildings; frame-work\nhouses, with the wood-work painted red; barracks of turf, with\nflowering plants; fir tree and birches look out from among the houses,\nand the churches with their balls and towers. The streets in S÷dermalm\nascend by flights of wooden steps up from the M lar lake, which is all\nactive with smoking steam-vessels, and with boats rowed by women in\ngay-colored dresses.",
        "I had brought with me a letter of introduction from Oersted, to the\ncelebrated Berzelius, who gave me a good reception in the old city of\nUpsala. From this place I returned to Stockholm. City, country, and\npeople, were all dear to me; it seemed to me, as I said before, that\nthe boundaries of my native land had stretched themselves out, and I\nnow first felt the kindredship of the three peoples, and in this\nfeeling I wrote a Scandinavian song, a hymn of praise for all the three\nnations, for that which was peculiar and best in each one of them.",
        "“One can see that the Swedes made a deal of him,” was the first remark\nwhich I heard at home on this song.",
        "Years pass on; the neighbors understand each other better;\nOehlenschl ger. Fredrika Bremer, and Tegn r, caused them mutually to\nread each other’s authors, and the foolish remains of the old enmity,\nwhich had no other foundation than that they did not know each other,\nvanished. There now prevails a beautiful, cordial relationship between\nSweden and Denmark. A Scandinavian club has been established in\nStockholm; and with this my song came to honor; and it was then said,\n\"it will outlive everything that Andersen has written:” which was as\nunjust as when they said that it was only the product of flattered\nvanity. This song is now sung in Sweden as well as in Denmark.",
        " On my return home I began to study history industriously, and made\nmyself still further acquainted with the literature of foreign\ncountries. Yet still the volume which afforded me the greatest pleasure\nwas that of nature; and in a summer residence among the country-seats\nof Funen, and more especially at Lykkesholm, with its highly romantic\nsite in the midst of woods, and at the noble seat of Glorup, from whose\npossessor I met with the most friendly reception, did I acquire more\ntrue wisdom, assuredly, in my solitary rambles, than I ever could have\ngained from the schools.",
        "The house of the Conference Councillor Collin in Copenhagen was at that\ntime, as it has been since, a second father’s house to me, and there I\nhad parents, and brothers and sisters. The best circles of social life\nwere open to me, and the student life interested me: here I mixed in\nthe pleasures of youth. The student life of Copenhagen is, besides\nthis, different from that of the German cities, and was at this time\npeculiar and full of life. For me this was most perceptible in the\nstudents’ clubs, where students and professors were accustomed to meet\neach other: there was there no boundary drawn between the youthful and\nelder men of letters. In this club were to be found the journals and\nbooks of various countries; once a week an author would read his last\nwork; a concert or some peculiar burlesque entertainment would take\nplace. It was here that what may be called the first Danish\npeople’scomedies took their origin,–comedies in which the events of\nthe day were worked up always in an innocent, but witty and amusing\nmanner. Sometimes dramatic representations were given in the presence\nof ladies for the furtherance of some noble purpose, as lately to\nassist Thorwaldsen’s Museum, to raise funds for the execution of\nBissen’s statue in marble, and for similar ends. The professors and\nstudents were the actors. I also appeared several times as an actor,\nand convinced myself that my terror at appearing on the stage was\ngreater than the talent which I perhaps possessed. Besides this, I\nwrote and arranged several pieces, and thus gave my assistance. Several\nscenes from this time, the scenes in the students’ club, I have worked\nup in my romance of “O. T.” The humor and love of life observable in\nvarious passages of this book, and in the little dramatic pieces\nwritten about this time, are owing to the influence of the family of\nCollin, where much good was done me in that respect, so that my morbid\nturn of mind was unable to gain the mastery of me. Collin’s eldest\nmarried daughter, especially, exercised great influence over me, by her\nmerry humor and wit. When the mind is yielding and elastic, like the\nexpanse of ocean, it readily, like the ocean, mirrors its environments.",
        "My writings, in my own country, were now classed among those which were\nalways bought and read; therefore for each fresh work I received a\nhigher payment. Yet, truly, when you consider what a circumscribed\nworld the Danish reading world is, you will see that this payment could\nnot be the most liberal. Yet I had to live. Collin, who is one of the\nmen who do more than they promise, was my help, my consolation, my\nsupport.",
        "At this time the late Count Conrad von Rantzau-Breitenburg, a native of\nHolstein, was Prime Minister in Denmark. He was of a noble, amiable\nnature, a highly educated man, and possessed of a truly chivalrous\ndisposition. He carefully observed the movements in German and Danish\nliterature. In his youth he had travelled much, and spent a long time\nin Spain and Italy, He read my “Improvisatore” in the original; his\nimagination was powerfully seized by it, and he spoke both at court and\nin his own private circles of my book in the warmest manner. He did not\nstop here; he sought me out, and became my benefactor and friend. One\nforenoon, whilst I was sitting solitarily in my little chamber, this\nfriendly man stood before me for the first time. He belonged to that\nclass of men who immediately inspire you with confidence; he besought\nme to visit him, and frankly asked me whether there were no means by\nwhich he could be of use to me. I hinted how oppressive it was to be\nforced to write in order to live, always to be forced to think\nof the morrow, and not move free from care, to be able to develop your\nmind and thoughts. He pressed my hand in a friendly manner, and\npromised to be an efficient friend. Collin and Oersted secretly\nassociated themselves with him, and became my intercessors.",
        "Already for many years there had existed, under Frederick VI., an\ninstitution which does the highest honor to the Danish government,\nnamely, that beside the considerable sum expended yearly, for the\ntravelling expenses of young literary men and artists, a small pension\nshall be awarded to such of them as enjoy no office emoluments. All our\nmost important poets have had a share of this assistance,–\nOehlenschl ger, Ingemann, Heiberg, C. Winther, and others. Hertz had\njust then received such a pension, and his future life made thus the\nmore secure. It was my hope and my wish that the same good fortune\nmight be mine–and it was. Frederick VI. granted me two hundred rix\ndollars banco yearly. I was filled with gratitude and joy. I was\nnolonger forced to write in order to live; I had a sure support\nin the possible event of sickness. I was less dependent upon the people\nabout me. A new chapter of my life began.",
        "From this day forward, it was as if a more constant sunshine had\nentered my heart. I felt within myself more repose, more certainty; it\nwas clear to me, as I glanced back over my earlier life, that a loving\nProvidence watched over me, that all was directed for me by a higher\nPower; and the firmer becomes such a conviction, the more secure does a\nman feel himself. My childhood lay behind me, my youthful life began\nproperly from this period; hitherto it had been only an arduous\nswimming against the stream. The spring of my life commenced; but still\nthe spring had its dark days, its storms, before it advanced to settled\nsummer; it has these in order to develop what shall then ripen. That\nwhich one of my dearest friends wrote to me on one of my later travels\nabroad, may serve as an introduction to what I have here to relate. He\nwrote in his own peculiar style:–\"It is your vivid imagination which\ncreates the idea of your being despised in Denmark; it is utterly\nuntrue. You and Denmark agree admirably, and you would agree still\nbetter, if there were in Denmark no theatre–Hinc illae\nlacrymae! This cursed theatre. Is this, then, Denmark? and are you,\nthen, nothing but a writer for the theatre?”",
        "Herein lies a solid truth. The theatre has been the cave out of which\nmost of the evil storms have burst upon me. They are peculiar people,\nthese people of the theatre,–as different, in fact, from others, as\nBedouins from Germans; from the first pantomimist to the first lover,\neveryone places himself systematically in one scale, and puts all the\nworld in the other. The Danish theatre is a good theatre, it may indeed\nbe placed on a level with the Burg theatre in Vienna; but the theatre\nin Copenhagen plays too great a part in conversation, and possesses in\nmost circles too much importance. I am not sufficiently acquainted with\nthe stage and the actors in other great cities, and therefore cannot\ncompare them with our theatre; but ours has too little military\ndiscipline, and this is absolutely necessary where many people have to\nform a whole, even when that whole is an artistical one. The most\ndistinguished dramatic poets in Denmark–that is to say, in Copenhagen,\nfor there only is a theatre–have their troubles. Those actors and\nactresses who, through talent or the popular favor, take the first\nrank, very often place themselves above both the managers and authors.\nThese must pay court to them, or they may ruin a part, or what is still\nworse, may spread abroad an unfavorable opinion of the piece previous\nto its being acted; and thus you have a coffee-house criticism before\nany one ought properly to know anything of the work. It is moreover\ncharacteristic of the people of Copenhagen, that when a new piece is\nannounced, they do not say, “I am glad of it,” but, “It will probably\nbe good for nothing; it will be hissed off the stage.” That hissing-off\nplays a great part, and is an amusement which fills the house; but it\nis not the bad actor who is hissed, no, the author and the composer\nonly are the criminals; for them the scaffold is erected. Five minutes\nis the usual time, and the whistles resound, and the lovely women smile\nand felicitate themselves, like the Spanish ladies at their bloody\nbullfights. All our most eminent dramatic writers have been whistled\ndown,–as Oehlenschl ger, Heiberg, Oversko, and others; to say nothing\nof foreign classics, as Moli re. In the mean time the theatre is the\nmost profitable sphere of labor for the Danish writer, whose public\ndoes not extend far beyond the frontiers. This had induced me to write\nthe opera-text already spoken of, on account of which I was so severely\ncriticised; and an internal impulse drove me afterwards to add some\nother works. Collin was no longer manager of the theatre, Councillor of\nJustice Molbeck had taken his place; and the tyranny which now\ncommenced degenerated into the comic. I fancy that in course of time\nthe manuscript volumes of the censorship, which are preserved in the\ntheatre, and in which Molbeck has certainly recorded his judgments on\nreceived and rejected pieces, will present some remarkable\ncharacteristics. Over all that I wrote the staff was broken! One way\nwas open to me by which to bring my pieces on the stage; and that was\nto give them to those actors who in summer gave representations at\ntheir own cost. In the summer of 1839 I wrote the vaudeville of “The\nInvisible One on Sprog÷,” to scenery which had been painted for another\npiece which fell through; and the unrestrained merriment of the piece\ngave it such favor with the public, that I obtained its acceptance by\nthe manager; and that light sketch still maintains itself on the\nboards, and has survived such a number of representations as I had\nnever anticipated.",
        "This approbation, however, procured me no further advantage, for each\nof my succeeding dramatic works received only rejection, and occasioned\nme only mortification. Nevertheless, seized by the idea and the\ncircumstances of the little French narrative, ’Les  paves,” I\ndetermined to dramatise it; and as I had often heard that I did not\npossess the assiduity sufficient to work my mat riel well, I resolved\nto labor this drama–\"The Mulatto\"–from the beginning to the end, in\nthe most diligent manner, and to compose it in alternately rhyming\nverse, as was then the fashion. It was a foreign subject of which I\navailed myself; but if verses are music, I at least endeavored to adapt\nmy music to the text, and to let the poetry of another diffuse itself\nthrough my spiritual blood; so that people should not be heard to say,\nas they had done before, regarding the romance of Walter Scott, that\nthe composition was cut down and fitted to the stage.",
        "The piece was ready, and declared by able men, old friends, and actors\nwho were to appear in it, to be excellent; a rich dramatic capacity lay\nin the mat riel, and my lyrical composition clothed this with so fresh\na green, that people appeared satisfied. The piece was sent in, and was\nrejected by Molbeck. It was sufficiently known that what he cherished\nfor the boards, withered there the first evening; but what he cast away\nas weeds were flowers for the garden–a real consolation for me. The\nassistant-manager, Privy Counsellor of State, Adler, a man of taste and\nliberality, became the patron of my work; and since a very favorable\nopinion of it already prevailed with the public, after I had read it to\nmany persons, it was resolved on for representation. I had the honor to\nread it before my present King and Queen, who received me in a very\nkind and friendly manner, and from whom, since that time, I have\nexperienced many proofs of favor and cordiality. The day of\nrepresentation arrived; the bills were posted; I had not closed my eyes\nthrough the whole night from excitement and expectation; the people\nalready stood in throngs before the theatre, to procure tickets, when\nroyal messengers galloped through the streets, solemn groups collected,\nthe minute guns pealed,–Frederick VI. had died this morning!",
        "For two months more was the theatre closed, and was opened under\nChristian VIII., with my drama–\"The Mulatto;” which was received with\nthe most triumphant acclamation; but I could not at once feel the joy\nof it, I felt only relieved from a state of excitement, and breathed\nmore freely.",
        "This piece continued through a series of representations to receive the\nsame approbation; many placed this work far above all my former ones,\nand considered that with it began my proper poetical career. It was\nsoon translated into the Swedish, and acted with applause at the royal\ntheatre in Stockholm. Travelling players introduced it into the smaller\ntowns in the neighboring country; a Danish company gave it in the\noriginal language, in the Swedish city Malm÷, and a troop of students\nfrom the university town of Lund, welcomed it with enthusiasm. I had\nbeen for a week previous on a visit at some Swedish country houses,\nwhere I was entertained with so much cordial kindness that the\nrecollection of it will never quit my bosom; and there, in a foreign\ncountry, I received the first public testimony of honor, and which has\nleft upon me the deepest and most inextinguishable impression. I was\ninvited by some students of Lund to visit their ancient town. Here a\npublic dinner was given to me; speeches were made, toasts were\npronounced; and as I was in the evening in a family circle, I was\ninformed that the students meant to honor me with a serenade.",
        "I felt myself actually overcome by this intelligence; my heart throbbed\nfeverishly as I descried the thronging troop, with their blue caps, and\narm-in-arm approaching the house. I experienced a feeling of\nhumiliation; a most lively consciousness of my deficiencies, so that I\nseemed bowed to the very earth at the moment others were elevating me.\nAs they all uncovered their heads while I stepped forth, I had need of\nall my thoughts to avoid bursting into tears. In the feeling that I was\nunworthy of all this, I glanced round to see whether a smile did not\npass over the face of some one, but I could discern nothing of the\nkind; and such a discovery would, at that moment, have inflicted on me\nthe deepest wound.",
        "After an hurrah, a speech was delivered, of which I clearly recollect\nthe following words:–\"When your native land, and the natives of Europe\noffer you their homage, then may you never forget that the first public\nhonors were conferred on you by the students of Lund.”",
        "When the heart is warm, the strength of the expression is not weighed.\nI felt it deeply, and replied, that from this moment I became aware\nthat I must assert a name in order to render myself worthy of these\ntokens of honor. I pressed the hands of those nearest to me, and\nreturned them thanks so deep, so heartfelt,–certainly never was an\nexpression of thanks more sincere. When I returned to my chamber, I\nwent aside, in order to weep out this excitement, this overwhelming\nsensation. “Think no more of it, be joyous with us,” said some of my\nlively Swedish friends; but a deep earnestness had entered my soul.\nOften has the memory of this time come back to me; and no noble-minded\nman, who reads these pages will discover a vanity in the fact, that I\nhave lingered so long over this moment of life, which scorched the\nroots of pride rather than nourished them.",
        "My drama was now to be brought on the stage at Malm÷; the students\nwished to see it; but I hastened my departure, that I might not be in\nthe theatre at the time. With gratitude and joy fly my thoughts towards\nthe Swedish University city, but I myself have not been there again\nsince. In the Swedish newspapers the honors paid me were mentioned, and\nit was added that the Swedes were not unaware that in my own country\nthere was a clique which persecuted me; but that this should not hinder\nmy neighbors from offering me the honors which they deemed my due.",
        "It was when I had returned to Copenhagen that I first truly felt how\ncordially I had been received by the Swedes; amongst some of my old and\ntried friends I found the most genuine sympathy. I saw tears in their\neyes, tears of joy for the honors paid me; and especially, said they,\nfor the manner in which I had received them. There is but one manner\nfor me; at once, in the midst of joy, I fly with thanks to God.",
        "There were certain persons who smiled at the enthusiasm; certain voices\nraised themselves already against “The Mulatto;\"–\"the mat riel was\nmerely borrowed;” the French narrative was scrupulously studied. That\nexaggerated praise which I had received, now made me sensitive to the\nblame; I could bear it less easily than before, and saw more clearly,\nthat it did not spring out of an interest in the matter, but was only\nuttered in order to mortify me. For the rest, my mind was fresh and\nelastic; I conceived precisely at this time the idea of “The Picture-\nBook without Pictures,” and worked it out. This little book appears, to\njudge by the reviews and the number of editions, to have obtained an\nextraordinary popularity in Germany; it was also translated into\nSwedish, and dedicated to myself; at home, it was here less esteemed;\npeople talked only of The Mulatto; and finally, only of the borrowed\nmat riel of it. I determined, therefore to produce a new dramatic work,\nin which both subject and development, in fact, everything should be of\nmy own conception. I had the idea, and now wrote the tragedy of The\nMoorish Maiden, hoping through this to stop the mouths of all my\ndetractors, and to assert my place as a dramatic poet. I hoped, too,\nthrough the income from this, together with the proceeds of The\nMulatto, to be able to make a fresh journey, not only to Italy, but to\nGreece and Turkey. My first going abroad had more than all besides\noperated towards my intellectual development; I was therefore full of\nthe passion for travel, and of the endeavor to acquire more knowledge\nof nature and of human life.",
        "My new piece did not please Heiberg, nor indeed my dramatic endeavors\nat all; his wife–for whom the chief part appeared to me especially to\nbe written–refused, and that not in the most friendly manner, to play\nit. Deeply wounded, I went forth. I lamented this to some individuals.\nWhether this was repeated, or whether a complaint against the favorite\nof the public is a crime, enough: from this hour Heiberg became my\nopponent,–he whose intellectual rank I so highly estimated,–he with\nwhom I would so willingly have allied myself,–and he who so often–I\nwill venture to say it–I had approached with the whole sincerity of my\nnature. I have constantly declared his wife to be so distinguished an\nactress, and continue still so entirely of this opinion, that I would\nnot hesitate one moment to assert that she would have a European\nreputation, were the Danish language as widely diffused as the German\nor the French. In tragedy she is, by the spirit and the geniality with\nwhich she comprehends and fills any part, a most interesting object;\nand in comedy she stands unrivalled.",
        "The wrong may be on my side or not,–no matter: a party was opposed to\nme. I felt myself wounded, excited by many coincident annoyances there.\nI felt uncomfortable in my native country, yes, almost ill. I therefore\nleft my piece to its fate, and, suffering and disconcerted, I hastened\nforth. In this mood I wrote a prologue to The Moorish Maiden; which\nbetrayed my irritated mind far too palpably. If I would represent this\nportion of my life more clearly and reflectively it would require me to\npenetrate into the mysteries of the theatre, to analyze our aesthetic\ncliques, and to drag into conspicuous notice many individuals, who do\nnot belong to publicity. Many persons in my place would, like me, have\nfallen ill, or would have resented it vehemently: perhaps the latter\nwould have been the most sensible.",
        "At my departure, many of my young friends amongst the students prepared\na banquet for me; and amongst the elder ones who were present to\nreceive me were Collin, Oehlenschl ger and Oersted. This was somewhat\nof sunshine in the midst of my mortification; songs by Oehlenschl ger\nand Hillerup were sung; and I found cordiality and friendship, as I\nquitted my country in distress. This was in October of 1840.",
        "For the second time I went to Italy and Rome, to Greece and\nConstantinople–a journey which I have described after my own manner in\nA Poet’s Bazaar.",
        "In Holstein I continued some days with Count Rantzau-Breitenburg, who\nhad before invited me, and whose ancestral castle I now for the first\ntime visited. Here I became acquainted with the rich scenery of\nHolstein, heath and moorland, and then hastened by Nuremberg to Munich,\nwhere I again met with Cornelius and Schelling, and was kindly received\nby Kaulbach and Schelling. I cast a passing glance on the artistic life\nin Munich, but for the most part pursued my own solitary course,\nsometimes filled with the joy of life, but oftener despairing of my\npowers. I possessed a peculiar talent, that of lingering on the gloomy\nside of life, of extracting the bitter from it, of tasting it; and\nunderstood well, when the whole was exhausted, how to torment myself.",
        "In the winter season I crossed the Brenner, remained some days in\nFlorence, which I had before visited for a longer time, and about\nChristmas reached Rome. Here again I saw the noble treasures of art,\nmet old friends, and once more passed a Carnival and Moccoli. But not\nalone was I bodily ill; nature around me appeared likewise to sicken;\nthere was neither the tranquillity nor the freshness which attended my\nfirst sojourn in Rome. The rocks quaked, the Tiber twice rose into the\nstreets, fever raged, and snatched numbers away. In a few days Prince\nBorghese lost his wife and three sons. Rain and wind prevailed; in\nshort, it was dismal, and from home cold lotions only were sent me. My\nletters told me that The Moorish Maiden had several times been acted\nthrough, and had gone quietly off the stage; but, as was seen\nbeforehand, a small public only had been present, and therefore the\nmanager had laid the piece aside. Other Copenhagen letters to our\ncountrymen in Rome spoke with enthusiasm of a new work by Heiberg; a\nsatirical poem–A Soul after Death. It was but just out, they wrote;\nall Copenhagen was full of it, and Andersen was famously handled in it.\nThe book was admirable, and I was made ridiculous in it. That was the\nwhole which I heard,–all that I knew. No one told me what really was\nsaid of me; wherein lay the amusement and the ludicrous. It is doubly\npainful to be ridiculed when we don’t know wherefore we are so. The\ninformation operated like molten lead dropped into a wound, and\nagonized me cruelly. It was not till after my return to Denmark that I\nread this book, and found that what was said of me in it, was really\nnothing in itself which was worth laying to heart. It was a jest over\nmy celebrity “from Schonen to Hundsr ck”, which did not please Heiberg;\nhe therefore sent my Mulatto and The Moorish Maiden to the infernal\nregions, where–and that was the most witty conceit–the condemned were\ndoomed to witness the performance of both pieces in one evening; and\nthen they could go away and lay themselves down quietly. I found the\npoetry, for the rest, so excellent, that I was half induced to write to\nHeiberg, and to return him my thanks for it; but I slept upon this\nfancy, and when I awoke and was more composed, I feared lest such\nthanks should be misunderstood; and so I gave it up.",
        "In Rome, as I have said, I did not see the book; I only heard the\narrows whizz and felt their wound, but I did not know what the poison\nwas which lay concealed in them. It seemed to me that Rome was no joy-\nbringing city; when I was there before, I had also passed dark and\nbitter days. I was ill, for the first time in my life, truly and bodily\nill, and I made haste to get away.",
        "The Danish poet Holst was then in Rome; he had received this year a\ntravelling pension. Hoist had written an elegy on King Frederick VI.,\nwhich went from mouth to mouth, and awoke an enthusiasm, like that of\nBecker’s contemporaneous Rhine song in Germany. He lived in the same\nhouse with me in Rome, and showed me much sympathy: with him I made the\njourney to Naples, where, notwithstanding it was March, the sun would\nnot properly shine, and the snow lay on the hills around. There was\nfever in my blood; I suffered in body and in mind; and I soon lay so\nseverely affected by it, that certainly nothing but a speedy blood-\nletting, to which my excellent Neapolitan landlord compelled me, saved\nmy life.",
        "In a few days I grew sensibly better; and I now proceeded by a French\nwar steamer to Greece. Holst accompanied me on board. It was now as if\na new life had risen for me; and in truth this was the case; and if\nthis does not appear legibly in my later writings, yet it manifested\nitself in my views of life, and in my whole inner development. As I saw\nmy European home lie far behind me, it seemed to me as if a stream of\nforgetfulness flowed of all bitter and rankling remembrances: I felt\nhealth in my blood, health in my thoughts, and freshly and courageously\nI again raised my head.",
        "Like another Switzerland, with a loftier and clearer heaven than the\nItalian, Greece lay before me; nature made a deep and solemn impression\nupon me; I felt the sentiment of standing on the great battle field of\nthe world, where nation had striven with nation, and had perished. No\nsingle poem can embrace such greatness; every scorched-up bed of a\nstream, every height, every stone, has mighty memoirs to relate. How\nlittle appear the inequalities of daily life in such a place! A kingdom\nof ideas streamed through me, and with such a fulness, that none of\nthem fixed themselves on paper. I had a desire to express the idea,\nthat the godlike was here on earth to maintain its contest, that it is\nthrust backward, and yet advances again victoriously through all ages;\nand I found in the legend of the Wandering Jew an occasion for it. For\ntwelve months this fiction had been emerging from the sea of my\nthoughts; often did it wholly fill me; sometimes I fancied with the\nalchemists that I had dug up the treasure; then again it sank suddenly,\nand I despaired of ever being able to bring it to the light. I felt\nwhat a mass of knowledge of various kinds I must first acquire. Often\nat home, when I was compelled to hear reproofs on what they call a want\nof study, I had sat deep into the night, and had studied history in\nHegel’s Philosophy of History. I said nothing of this, or other\nstudies, or they would immediately have been spoken of, in the manner\nof an instructive lady, who said, that people justly complained that I\ndid not possess learning enough. “You have really no mythology” said\nshe; “in all your poems there appears no single God. You must pursue\nmythology; you must read Racine and Corneille.” That she called\nlearning; and in like manner every one had something peculiar to\nrecommend. For my poem of Ahasuerus I had read much and noted much, but\nyet not enough; in Greece, I thought, the whole will collect itself\ninto clearness. The poem is not yet ready, but I hope that it will\nbecome so to my honor; for it happens with the children of the spirit,\nas with the earthly ones,–they grow as they sleep.",
        "In Athens I was heartily welcomed by Professor Ross, a native of\nHolstein, and by my countrymen. I found hospitality and a friendly\nfeeling in the noble Prokesch-Osten; even the king and queen received\nme most graciously. I celebrated my birthday in the Acropolis.",
        "From Athens I sailed to Smyrna, and with me it was no childish pleasure\nto be able to tread another quarter of the globe. I felt a devotion in\nit, like that which I felt as a child when I entered the old church at\nOdense. I thought on Christ, who bled on this earth; I thought on\nHomer, whose song eternally resounds hence over the earth. The shores\nof Asia preached to me their sermons, and were perhaps more impressive\nthan any sermon in any church can be.",
        "In Constantinople I passed eleven interesting days; and according to my\ngood fortune in travel, the birthday of Mahomet itself fell exactly\nduring my stay there. I saw the grand illumination, which completely\ntransported me into the Thousand and One Nights.",
        "Our Danish ambassador lived several miles from Constantinople, and I\nhad therefore no opportunity of seeing him; but I found a cordial\nreception with the Austrian internuntius, Baron von St rmer. With him I\nhad a German home and friends. I contemplated making my return by the\nBlack Sea and up the Danube; but the country was disturbed; it was said\nthere had been several thousand Christians murdered. My companions of\nthe voyage, in the hotel where I resided, gave up this route of the\nDanube, for which I had the greatest desire, and collectively\ncounselled me against it. But in this case I must return again by\nGreece and Italy–it was a severe conflict.",
        "I do not belong to the courageous; I feel fear, especially in little\ndangers; but in great ones, and when an advantage is to be won, then I\nhave a will, and it has grown firmer with years. I may tremble, I may\nfear; but I still do that which I consider the most proper to be done.\nI am not ashamed to confess my weakness; I hold that when out of our\nown true conviction we run counter to our inborn fear, we have done our\nduty. I had a strong desire to become acquainted with the interior of\nthe country, and to traverse the Danube in its greatest expansion. I\nbattled with myself; my imagination pointed to me the most horrible\ncircumstances; it was an anxious night. In the morning I took counsel\nwith Baron St rmer; and as he was of opinion that I might undertake the\nvoyage, I determined upon it. From the moment that I had taken my\ndetermination, I had the most immovable reliance on Providence, and\nflung myself calmly on my fate. Nothing happened to me. The voyage was\nprosperous, and after the quarantine on the Wallachian frontier, which\nwas painful enough to me, I arrived at Vienna on the twenty-first day\nof the journey. The sight of its towers, and the meeting with numerous\nDanes, awoke in me the thought of being speedily again at home. The\nidea bowed down my heart, and sad recollections and mortifications rose\nup within me once more.",
        "In August, 1841, I was again in Copenhagen. There I wrote my\nrecollections of travel, under the title of A Poet’s Bazaar, in several\nchapters, according to the countries. In various places abroad I had\nmet with individuals, as at home, to whom I felt myself attached. A\npoet is like the bird; he gives what he has, and he gives a song. I was\ndesirous to give every one of those dear ones such a song. It was a\nfugitive idea, born, may I venture to say, in a grateful mood. Count\nRantzau-Breitenburg, who had resided in Italy, who loved the land, and\nwas become a friend and benefactor to me through my Improvisatore, must\nlove that part of the book which treated of his country. To Liszt and\nThalberg, who had both shown me the greatest friendship, I dedicated\nthe portion which contained the voyage up the Danube, because one was a\nHungarian and the other an Austrian. With these indications, the reader\nwill easily be able to trace out the thought which influenced me in the\nchoice of each dedication. But these appropriations were, in my native\ncountry, regarded as a fresh proof of my vanity;–\"I wished to figure\nwith great names, to name distinguished people as my friends.”",
        "The book has been translated into several languages, and the\ndedications with it. I know not how they have been regarded abroad; if\nI have been judged there as in Denmark, I hope that this explanation\nwill change the opinion concerning them. In Denmark my Bazaar procured\nme the most handsome remuneration that I have as yet received,–a proof\nthat I was at length read there. No regular criticism appeared upon it,\nif we except notices in some daily papers, and afterwards in the\npoetical attempt of a young writer who, a year before, had testified to\nme in writing his love, and his wish to do me honor; but who now, in\nhis first public appearance, launched his satirical poem against his\nfriend. I was personally attached to this young man, and am so still.\nHe assuredly thought more on the popularity he would gain by sailing in\nthe wake of Heiberg, than on the pain he would inflict on me. The\nnewspaper criticism in Copenhagen was infinitely stupid. It was set\ndown as exaggerated, that I could have seen the whole round blue globe\nof the moon in Smyrna at the time of the new moon. That was called\nfancy and extravagance, which there every one sees who can open his\neyes. The new moon has a dark blue and perfectly round disk.",
        "The Danish critics have generally no open eye for nature: even the\nhighest and most cultivated monthly periodical of literature in Denmark\ncensured me once because, in a poem I had described a rainbow by\nmoonlight. That too was my fancy, which, said they, carried me too far.\nWhen I said in the Bazaar, “if I were a painter, I would paint this\nbridge; but, as I am no painter, but a poet, I must therefore speak,\"\n&c. Upon this the critic says, “He is so vain, that he tells us himself\nthat he is a poet.” There is something so pitiful in such criticism,\nthat one cannot be wounded by it; but even when we are the most\npeaceable of men, we feel a desire to flagellate such wet dogs, who\ncome into our rooms and lay themselves down in the best place in them.\nThere might be a whole Fool’s Chronicle written of all the absurd and\nshameless things which, from my first appearance before the public till\nthis moment, I have been compelled to hear.",
        "In the meantime the Bazaar was much read, and made what is called a\nhit. I received, connected with this book, much encouragement and many\nrecognitions from individuals of the highest distinction in the realms\nof intellect in my native land.",
        "The journey had strengthened me both in mind and body; I began to show\nindications of a firmer purpose, a more certain judgment. I was now in\nharmony with myself and with mankind around me.",
        "Political life in Denmark had, at that time, arrived at a higher\ndevelopment, producing both good and evil fruits. The eloquence which\nhad formerly accustomed itself to the Demosthenic mode, that of putting\nlittle pebbles in the mouth, the little pebbles of every day life, now\nexercised itself more freely on subjects of greater interest. I felt no\ncall thereto, and no necessity to mix myself up in such matters; for I\nthen believed that the politics of our times were a great misfortune\nto many a poet. Madame, politics are like Venus; they whom she decoys\ninto her castle perish. It fares with the writings of these poets as\nwith the newspapers: they are seized upon, read, praised, and\nforgotten. In our days every one wishes to rule; the subjective makes\nits power of value; people forget that that which is thought of cannot\nalways be carried out, and that many things look very different when\ncontemplated from the top of the tree, to what they did when seen from\nits roots. I will bow myself before him who is influenced by a noble\nconviction, and who only desires that which is conducive to good, be he\nprince or man of the people. Politics are no affair of mine. God has\nimparted to me another mission: that I felt, and that I feel still. I\nmet in the so-called first families of the country a number of\nfriendly, kind-hearted men, who valued the good that was in me,\nreceived me into their circles, and permitted me to participate in the\nhappiness of their opulent summer residences; so that, still feeling\nindependent, I could thoroughly give myself up to the pleasures of\nnature, the solitude of woods, and country life. There for the first\ntime I lived wholly among the scenery of Denmark, and there I wrote the\ngreater number of my fairy tales. On the banks of quiet lakes, amid the\nwoods, on the green grassy pastures, where the game sprang past me and\nthe stork paced along on his red legs, I heard nothing of politics,\nnothing of polemics; I heard no one practising himself in Hagel’s\nphraseology. Nature, which was around me and within me, preached to me\nof my calling. I spent many happy days at the old house of Gisselfeld,\nformerly a monastery, which stands in the deepest solitude of the\nwoods, surrounded with lakes and hills. The possessor of this fine\nplace, the old Countess Danneskjold, mother of the Duchess of\nAugustenburg, was an agreeable and excellent lady, I was there not as a\npoor child of the people, but as a cordially-received guest. The\nbeeches now overshadow her grave in the midst of that pleasant scenery\nto which her heart was allied.",
        "Close by Gisselfeld, but in a still finer situation, and of much\ngreater extent, lies the estate of Bregentoed, which belongs to Count\nMoltke, Danish Minister of Finance. The hospitality which I met with in\nthis place, one of the richest and most beautiful of our country, and\nthe happy, social life which surrounded me here, have diffused a\nsunshine over my life.",
        "It may appear, perhaps, as if I desired to bring the names of great\npeople prominently forward, and make a parade of them; or as if I\nwished in this way to offer a kind of thanks to my benefactors. They\nneed it not, and I should be obliged to mention many other names still\nif this were my intention. I speak, however, only of these two places,\nand of Nys÷, which belongs to Baron Stampe, and which has become\ncelebrated through Thorwaldsen. Here I lived much with the great\nsculptor, and here I became acquainted with one of my dearest young\nfriends, the future possessor of the place.",
        "Knowledge of life in these various circles has had great influence on\nme: among princes, among the nobility, and among the poorest of the\npeople, I have met with specimens of noble humanity. We all of us\nresemble each other in that which is good and best.",
        "Winter life in Denmark has likewise its attractions and its rich\nvariety. I spent also some time in the country during this season, and\nmade myself acquainted with its peculiar characteristics. The greatest\npart of my time, however, I passed in Copenhagen. I felt myself at home\nwith the married sons and daughters of Collin, where a number of\namiable children were growing up. Every year strengthened the bond of\nfriendship between myself and the nobly-gifted composer, Hartmann: art\nand the freshness of nature prospered in his house. Collin was my\ncounsellor in practical life, and Oersted in my literary affairs. The\ntheatre was, if I may so say, my club. I visited it every evening, and\nin this very year I had received a place in the so-called court stalls.\nAn author must, as a matter of course, work himself up to it. After the\nfirst accepted piece he obtains admission to the pit; after the second\ngreater work, in the stalls, where the actors have their seats; and\nafter three larger works, or a succession of lesser pieces, the poet is\nadvanced to the best places. Here were to be found Thorwaldsen,\nOehlenschl ger, and several older poets; and here also, in 1840,1\nobtained a place, after I had given in seven pieces. Whilst Thorwaldsen\nlived, I often, by his own wish, sate at his side. Oehlenschl ger was\nalso my neighbor, and in many an evening hour, when no one dreamed of\nit, my soul was steeped in deep humility, as I sate between these great\nspirits. The different periods of my life passed before me; the time\nwhen I sate on the hindmost bench in the box of the female figurantes,\nas well as that in which, full of childish superstition, I knelt down\nthere upon the stage and repeated the Lord’s Prayer, just before the\nvery place where I now sate among the first and the most distinguished\nmen. At the time, perhaps, when a countryman of mine thus thought of\nand passed judgment upon me,–\"there he sits, between the two great\nspirits, full of arrogance and pride;” he may now perceive by this\nacknowledgment how unjustly he has judged me. Humility, and prayer to\nGod for strength to deserve my happiness, filled my heart. May He\nalways enable me to preserve these feelings? I enjoyed the friendship\nof Thorwaldsen as well as of Oehlenschl ger, those two most\ndistinguished stars in the horizon of the North. I may here bring\nforward their reflected glory in and around me.",
        "There is in the character of Oehlenschl ger, when he is not seen in the\ncircles of the great, where he is quiet and reserved, something so open\nand child-like, that no one can help becoming attached to him. As a\npoet, he holds in the North a position of as great importance as Goethe\ndid in Germany. He is in his best works so penetrated by the spirit of\nthe North, that through him it has, as it were, ascended upon all\nnations. In foreign countries he is not so much appreciated. The works\nby which he is best known are “Correggio” and “Aladdin;” but assuredly\nhis masterly poem of “The Northern Gods” occupied a far higher rank: it\nis our “Iliad.” It possesses power, freshness–nay, any expression of\nmine is poor. It is possessed of grandeur; it is the poet\nOehlenschl ger in the bloom of his soul. Hakon, Jarl, and Palnatoke\nwill live in the poetry of Oehlenschl ger as long as mankind endures.\nDenmark, Norway, and Sweden have fully appreciated him, and have shown\nhim that they do so, and whenever it is asked who occupies the first\nplace in the kingdom of mind, the palm is always awarded to him. He is\nthe true-born poet; he appears always young, whilst he himself, the\noldest of all, surpasses all in the productiveness of his mind. He\nlistened with friendly disposition to my first lyrical outpourings; and\nhe acknowledged with earnestness and cordiality the poet who told the\nfairy-tales. My Biographer in the Danish Pantheon brought me in contact\nwith Oehlenschl ger, when he said, “In our days it is becoming more and\nmore rare for any one, by implicitly following those inborn impulses of\nhis soul, which make themselves irresistibly felt, to step forward as\nan artist or a poet. He is more frequently fashioned by fate and\ncircumstances than apparently destined by nature herself for this\noffice. With the greater number of our poets an early acquaintance with\npassion, early inward experience, or outward circumstances, stand\ninstead of the original vein of nature, and this cannot in any case be\nmore incontestably proved in our own literature than by instancing\nOehlenschl ger and Andersen. And in this way it may be explained why\nthe former has been so frequently the object for the attacks of the\ncritics, and why the latter was first properly appreciated as a poet in\nforeign countries where civilization of a longer date has already\nproduced a disinclination for the compulsory rule of schools, and has\noccasioned a reaction towards that which is fresh and natural; whilst\nwe Danes, on the contrary, cherish a pious respect for the yoke of the\nschools and the worn-out wisdom of maxims.”",
        "Thorwaldsen, whom, as I have already said, I had become acquainted with\nin Rome in the years 1833 and 1834, was expected in Denmark in the\nautumn of 1838, and great festive preparations were made in\nconsequence. A flag was to wave upon one of the towers of Copenhagen as\nsoon as the vessel which brought him should come in sight. It was a\nnational festival. Boats decorated with flowers and flags filled the\nRhede; painters, sculptors, all had their flags with emblems; the\nstudents’ bore a Minerva, the poets’ a Pegasus. It was misty weather,\nand the ship was first seen when it was already close by the city, and\nall poured out to meet him. The poets, who, I believe, according to the\narrangement of Heiberg, had been invited, stood by their boat;\nOehlenschl ger and Heiberg alone had not arrived. And now guns were\nfired from the ship, which came to anchor, and it was to be feared that\nThorwaldsen might land before we had gone out to meet him. The wind\nbore the voice of singing over to us: the festive reception had already\nbegun.",
        "I wished to see him, and therefore cried out to the others, “Let us put\noff!”",
        "“Without Oehlenschl ger and Heiberg?” asked some one.",
        "“But they are not arrived, and it will be all over.”",
        "One of the poets declared that if these two men were not with us, I\nshould not sail under that flag, and pointed up to Pegasus.",
        "“We will throw it in the boat,” said I, and took it down from the\nstaff; the others now followed me, and came up just as Thorwaldsen\nreached land. We met with Oehlenschl ger and Heiberg in another boat,\nand they came over to us as the enthusiasm began on shore.",
        "The people drew Thorwaldsen’s carriage through the streets to his\nhouse, where everybody who had the slightest acquaintance with him, or\nwith the friends of a friend of his, thronged around him. In the\nevening the artists gave him a serenade, and the blaze of the torches\nillumined the garden under the large trees, there was an exultation and\njoy which really and truly was felt. Young and old hastened through the\nopen doors, and the joyful old man clasped those whom he knew to his\nbreast, gave them his kiss, and pressed their hands. There was a glory\nround Thorwaldsen which kept me timidly back: my heart beat for joy of\nseeing him who had met me when abroad with kindness and consolation,\nwho had pressed me to his heart, and had said that we must always\nremain friends. But here in this jubilant crowd, where thousands\nnoticed every movement of his, where I too by all these should be\nobserved and criticised–yes, criticised as a vain man who now only\nwished to show that he too was acquainted with Thorwaldsen, and that\nthis great man was kind and friendly towards him–here, in this dense\ncrowd, I drew myself back, and avoided being recognized by him. Some\ndays afterwards, and early in the morning, I went to call upon him, and\nfound him as a friend who had wondered at not having seen me earlier.",
        "In honor of Thorwaldsen a musical-poetic academy was established, and\nthe poets, who were invited to do so by Heiberg, wrote and read each\none a poem in praise of him who had returned home. I wrote of Jason who\nfetched the golden fleece–that is to say, Jason-Thorwaldsen, who went\nforth to win golden art. A great dinner and a ball closed the festival,\nin which, for the first time in Denmark, popular life and a subject of\ngreat interest in the realms of art were made public.",
        "From this evening I saw Thorwaldsen almost daily in company or in his\nstudio: I often passed several weeks together with him at Nys÷, where\nhe seemed to have firmly taken root, and where the greater number of\nhis works, executed in Denmark, had their origin. He was of a healthful\nand simple disposition of mind, not without humor, and, therefore, he\nwas extremely attached to Holberg the poet: he did not at all enter\ninto the troubles and the disruptions of the world.",
        "One morning at Nys÷–at the time when he was working at his own statue\n–I entered his work-room and bade him good morning; he appeared as if\nhe did not wish to notice me, and I stole softly away again. At\nbreakfast he was very parsimonious in the use of words, and when\nsomebody asked him to say something at all events, he replied in his\ndry way:–",
        "“I have said more during this morning than in many whole days, but\nnobody heard me. There I stood, and fancied that Andersen was behind\nme, for he came, and said good morning–so I told him a long story\nabout myself and Byron. I thought that he might give one word in reply,\nand turned myself round; and there had I been standing a whole hour and\nchattering aloud to the bare walls.”",
        "We all of us besought him to let us hear the whole story yet once more;\nbut we had it now very short.",
        "“Oh, that was in Rome,” said he, “when I was about to make Byron’s\nstatue; he placed himself just opposite to me, and began immediately to\nassume quite another countenance to what was customary to him. ’Will not\nyou sit still?’ said I; ’but you must not make these faces.’ ’It is my\nexpression,’ said Byron. ’Indeed?’ said I, and then I made him as I\nwished, and everybody said, when it was finished, that I had hit the\nlikeness. When Byron, however, saw it, he said, ’It does not resemble\nme at all; I look more unhappy.’”",
        "“He was, above all things, so desirous of looking extremely unhappy,\"\nadded Thorwaldsen, with a comic expression.",
        "It afforded the great sculptor pleasure to listen to music after dinner\nwith half-shut eyes, and it was his greatest delight when in the\nevening the game of lotto began, which the whole neighborhood of Nys÷\nwas obliged to learn; they only played for glass pieces, and on this\naccount I am able to relate a peculiar characteristic of this otherwise\ngreat man–that he played with the greatest interest on purpose to win.\nHe would espouse with warmth and vehemence the part of those from whom\nhe believed that he had received an injustice; he opposed himself to\nunfairness and raillery, even against the lady of the house, who for\nthe rest had the most childlike sentiments towards him, and who had no\nother thought than how to make everything most agreeable to him. In his\ncompany I wrote several of my tales for children–for example, “Ole\nLuck Oin,” (\"Ole Shut Eye,”) to which he listened with pleasure and\ninterest. Often in the twilight, when the family circle sate in the\nopen garden parlor, Thorwaldsen would come softly behind me, and,\nclapping me on the shoulder, would ask, “Shall we little ones hear any\ntales tonight?”",
        "In his own peculiarly natural manner he bestowed the most bountiful\npraise on my fictions, for their truth; it delighted him to hear the\nsame stories over and over again. Often, during his most glorious\nworks, would he stand with laughing countenance, and listen to the\nstories of the Top and the Ball, and the Ugly Duckling. I possess a\ncertain talent of improvising in my native tongue little poems and\nsongs. This talent amused Thorwaldsen very much; and as he had\nmodelled, at Nys÷, Holberg’s portrait in clay, I was commissioned to\nmake a poem for his work, and he received, therefore, the following\nimpromptu:–",
        "  “No more shall Holberg live,” by Death was said,\n    “I crush the clay, his soul’s bonds heretofore.\"\n  “And from the formless clay, the cold, the dead,\"\n    Cried Thorwaldsen, “shall Holberg live once more.”",
        "One morning, when he had just modelled in clay his great bas-relief of\nthe Procession to Golgotha, I entered his study.",
        "“Tell me,” said he, “does it seem to you that I have dressed Pilate\nproperly?”",
        "“You must not say anything to him,” said the Baroness, who was always\nwith him: “it is right; it is excellent; go away with you!”",
        "Thorwaldsen repeated his question.",
        "“Well, then,” said I, “as you ask me, I must confess that it really\ndoes appear to me as if Pilate were dressed rather as an Egyptian than\nas a Roman.”",
        "“It seems to me so too,” said Thorwaldsen, seizing the clay with his\nhand, and destroying the figure.",
        "“Now you are guilty of his having annihilated an immortal work,\"\nexclaimed the Baroness to me with warmth.",
        "“Then we can make a new immortal work,” said he, in a cheerful humor,\nand modelled Pilate as he now remains in the bas-relief in the Ladies’\nChurch in Copenhagen.",
        "His last birth-day was celebrated there in the country. I had written a\nmerry little song, and it was hardly dry on the paper, when we sang it,\nin the early morning, before his door, accompanied by the music of\njingling fire-irons, gongs, and bottles rubbed against a basket.\nThorwaldsen himself, in his morning gown and slippers, opened his door,\nand danced round his chamber; swung round his Raphael’s cap, and joined\nin the chorus. There was life and mirth in the strong old man.",
        "On the last day of his life I sate by him at dinner; he was unusually\ngood-humored; repeated several witticisms which he had just read in the\nCorsair, a well-known Copenhagen newspaper, and spoke of the journey\nwhich he should undertake to Italy in the summer. After this we parted;\nhe went to the theatre, and I home.",
        "On the following morning the waiter at the hotel where I lived said,\n\"that it was a very remarkable thing about Thorwaldsen–that he had\ndied yesterday.”",
        "“Thorwaldsen!” exclaimed I; “he is not dead, I dined with him\nyesterday.”",
        "“People say that he died last evening at the theatre,” returned the\nwaiter.  I fancied that he might be taken ill; but still I felt a\nstrange anxiety, and hastened immediately over to his house. There lay\nhis corpse stretched out on the bed; the chamber was filled with\nstrangers; the floor wet with melted snow; the air stifling; no one\nsaid a word: the Baroness Stampe sate on the bed and wept bitterly. I\nstood trembling and deeply agitated.",
        "A farewell hymn, which I wrote, and to which Hartmann composed the\nmusic, was sung by Danish students over his coffin.",
        "In the summer of 1842, I wrote a little piece for the summer theatre,\ncalled, “The Bird in the Pear-tree,” in which several scenes were acted\nup in the pear-tree. I had called it a dramatic trifle, in order that\nno one might expect either a great work or one of a very elaborate\ncharacter. It was a little sketch, which, after being performed a few\ntimes, was received with so much applause, that the directors of the\ntheatre accepted it; nay, even Mrs. Heiberg, the favorite of the\npublic, desired to take a part in it. People had amused themselves; had\nthought the selection of the music excellent. I knew that the piece had\nstood its rehearsal–and then suddenly it was hissed. Some young men,\nwho gave the word to hiss, had said to some others, who inquired from\nthem their reasons for doing so, that the trifle had too much luck, and\nthen Andersen would be getting too mettlesome.",
        "I was not, on this evening, at the theatre myself, and had not the\nleast idea of what was going on. On the following I went to the house\nof one of my friends. I had head-ache, and was looking very grave. The\nlady of the house met me with a sympathizing manner, took my hand, and\nsaid, “Is it really worth while to take it so much to heart? There were\nonly two who hissed, the whole house beside took your part.”",
        "“Hissed! My part! Have I been hissed?” exclaimed I.",
        "It was quite comic; one person assured me that this hissing had been a\ntriumph for me; everybody had joined in acclamation, and “there was\nonly one who hissed.”",
        "After this, another person came, and I asked him of the number of those\nwho hissed. “Two,” said he. The next person said “three,” and said\npositively there were no more. One of my most veracious friends now\nmade his appearance, and I asked him upon his conscience, how many he\nhad heard; he laid his hand upon his heart, and said that, at the very\nhighest, they were five.",
        "“No,” said I, “now I will ask nobody more; the number grows just as\nwith Falstaff; here stands one who asserts that there was only one\nperson who hissed.”",
        "Shocked, and yet inclined to set it all right again, he replied, “Yes,\nthat is possible, but then it was a strong, powerful hiss.”",
        "By my last works, and through a rational economy, I had now saved a\nsmall sum of money, which I destined to the purposes of a new journey\nto Paris, where I arrived in the winter of 1843, by way of D sseldorf,\nthrough Belgium.",
        "Marmier had already, in the R vue de Paris, written an article\non me, La Vie d’un Po te. He had also translated several of my\npoems into French, and had actually honored me with a poem which is\nprinted in the above-named R vue. My name had thus reached, like\na sound, the ears of some persons in the literary world, and I here met\nwith a surprisingly friendly reception.",
        "At Victor Hugo’s invitation, I saw his abused Burggraves. Mr.\nand Mrs. Ancelot opened their house to me, and there I met Martinez\ndella Rosa and other remarkable men of these times. Lamart ne seemed to\nme, in his domestic, and in his whole personal appearance, as the\nprince of them all. On my apologizing because I spoke such bad French,\nhe replied, that he was to blame, because he did not understand the\nnorthern languages, in which, as he had discovered in late years, there\nexisted a fresh and vigorous literature, and where the poetical ground\nwas so peculiar that you had only to stoop down to find an old golden\nhorn. He asked about the Trollh tta canal, and avowed a wish to visit\nDenmark and Stockholm. He recollected also our now reigning king, to\nwhom, when as prince he was in Castellamare, he had paid his respects;\nbesides this, he exhibited for a Frenchman, an extraordinary\nacquaintance with names and places in Denmark. On my departure he wrote\na little poem for me, which I preserve amongst my dearest relics.",
        "I generally found the jovial Alexander Dumas in bed, even long after\nmid-day: here he lay, with paper, pen, and ink, and wrote his newest\ndrama. I found him thus one day; he nodded kindly to me, and said, “Sit\ndown a minute; I have just now a visit from my muse; she will be going\ndirectly.” He wrote on; spoke aloud; shouted a viva! sprang out\nof bed, and said, “The third act is finished!”",
        "One evening he conducted me round into the various theatres, that I\nmight see the life behind the scenes. We wandered about, arm in arm,\nalong the gay Boulevard.",
        "I also have to thank him for my acquaintance with Rachel. I had not\nseen her act, when Alexander Dumas asked me whether I had the desire to\nmake her acquaintance. One evening, when she was to come out as Phedra\nhe led me to the stage of the Th atre Fran ais. The Representation had\nbegun, and behind the scenes, where a folding screen had formed a sort\nof room, in which stood a table with refreshments, and a few ottomans,\nsate the young girl who, as an author has said, understands how to\nchisel living statues out of Racine’s and Corneille’s blocks of marble.\nShe was thin and slenderly formed, and looked very young. She looked to\nme there, and more particularly so afterwards in her own house, as an\nimage of mourning; as a young girl who has just wept out her sorrow,\nand will now let her thoughts repose in quiet. She accosted us kindly\nin a deep powerful voice. In the course of conversation with Dumas, she\nforgot me. I stood there quite superfluous. Dumas observed it, said\nsomething handsome of me, and on that I ventured to take part in the\ndiscourse, although I had a depressing feeling that I stood before\nthose who perhaps spoke the most beautiful French in all France. I said\nthat I truly had seen much that was glorious and interesting, but that\nI had never yet seen a Rachel, and that on her account especially had I\ndevoted the profits of my last work to a journey to Paris; and as, in\nconclusion, I added an apology on account of my French, she smiled and\nsaid, “When you say anything so polite as that which you have just said\nto me, to a Frenchwoman, she will always think that you speak well.”",
        "When I told her that her fame had resounded to the North, she declared\nthat it was her intention to go to Petersburg and Copenhagen: “and when\nI come to your city”, she said, “you must be my defender, as you are\nthe only one there whom I know; and in order that we may become\nacquainted, and as you, as you say, are come to Paris especially on my\naccount, we must see each other frequently. You will be welcome to me.\nI see my friends at my house every Thursday. But duty calls,” said she,\nand offering us her hand, she nodded kindly, and then stood a few paces\nfrom us on the stage, taller, quite different, and with the expression\nof the tragic muse herself. Joyous acclamations ascended to where we\nsat.",
        "As a Northlander I cannot accustom myself to the French mode of acting\ntragedy. Rachel plays in this same style, but in her it appears to be\nnature itself; it is as if all the others strove to imitate her. She is\nherself the French tragic muse, the others are only poor human beings.\nWhen Rachel plays people fancy that all tragedy must be acted in this\nmanner. It is in her truth and nature, but under another revelation to\nthat with which we are acquainted in the north.",
        "At her house everything is rich and magnificent, perhaps too\nrecherch. The innermost room was blue-green, with shaded lamps\nand statuettes of French authors. In the salon, properly speaking, the\ncolor which prevailed principally in the carpets, curtains, and\nbookcases was crimson. She herself was dressed in black, probably as\nshe is represented in the well-known English steel engraving of her.\nHer guests consisted of gentlemen, for the greater part artists and men\nof learning. I also heard a few titles amongst them. Richly apparelled\nservants announced the names of the arrivals; tea was drunk and\nrefreshments handed round, more in the German than the French style.",
        "Victor Hugo had told me that he found she understood the German\nlanguage. I asked her, and she replied in German, “ich kann es lesen;\nich bin ja in Lothringen geboren; ich habe deutsche B cher, sehn Sie\nhier!” and she showed me Grillparzer’s “Sappho,” and then immediately\ncontinued the conversation in French. She expressed her pleasure in\nacting the part of Sappho, and then spoke of Schiller’s “Maria Stuart,\"\nwhich character she has personated in a French version of that play. I\nsaw her in this part, and she gave the last act especially with such a\ncomposure and tragic feeling, that she might have been one of the best\nof German actresses; but it was precisely in this very act that the\nFrench liked her least.",
        "“My countrymen,” said she, “are not accustomed to this manner, and in\nthis manner alone can the part be given. No one should be raving when\nthe heart is almost broken with sorrow, and when he is about to take an\neverlasting farewell of his friends.”",
        "Her drawing-room was, for the most part, decorated with books which\nwere splendidly bound and arranged in handsome book-cases behind glass.\nA painting hung on the wall, which represented the interior of the\ntheatre in London, where she stood forward on the stage, and flowers\nand garlands were thrown to her across the orchestra. Below this\npicture hung a pretty little book-shelf, holding what I call “the high\nnobility among the poets,\"–Goethe, Schiller, Calderon, Shakspeare, &c.",
        "She asked me many questions respecting Germany and Denmark, art, and\nthe theatre; and she encouraged me with a kind smile around her grave\nmouth, when I stumbled in French and stopped for a moment to collect\nmyself, that I might not stick quite fast.",
        "“Only speak,” said she. “It is true that you do not speak French well.\nI have heard many foreigners speak my native language better; but their\nconversation has not been nearly as interesting as yours. I understand\nthe sense of your words perfectly, and that is the principal thing\nwhich interests me in you.”",
        "The last time we parted she wrote the following words in my album:\n\"L’art c’est le vrai! J’esp re que cet aphorisme ne semblera pas\nparadoxal   un  crivain si distingu  comme M. Andersen.”",
        "I perceived amiability of character in Alfred de Vigny. He has married\nan English lady, and that which is best in both nations seemed to unite\nin his house. The last evening which I spent in Paris, he himself, who\nis possessed of intellectual status and worldly wealth, came almost at\nmidnight to my lodging in the Rue Richelieu, ascended the many steps,\nand brought me his works under his arm. So much cordiality beamed in\nhis eyes and he seemed to be so full of kindness towards me, that I\nfelt affected by our separation.",
        "I also became acquainted with the sculptor David. There was a something\nin his demeanor and in his straightforward manner that reminded me of\nThorwaldsen and Bissen, especially of the latter. We did not meet till\ntowards the conclusion of my residence in Paris. He lamented it, and\nsaid that he would execute a bust of me if I would remain there longer.",
        "When I said, “But you know nothing of me as a poet, and cannot tell\nwhether I deserve it or not,” he looked earnestly in my face, clapped\nme on the shoulder, and said, “I have, however, read you yourself\nbefore your books. You are a poet.”",
        "At the Countess ––’s, where I met with Balzac, I saw an old lady, the\nexpression of whose countenance attracted my attention. There was\nsomething so animated, so cordial in it, and everybody gathered about\nher. The Countess introduced me to her, and I heard that she was Madame\nReybaud, the authoress of Les Epaves, the little story which I had made\nuse of for my little drama of The Mulatto. I told her all about it, and\nof the representation of the piece, which interested her so much, that\nshe became from this evening my especial protectress. We went out one\nevening together and exchanged ideas. She corrected my French and\nallowed me to repeat what did not appear correct to her. She is a lady\nof rich mental endowments, with a clear insight into the world, and she\nshowed maternal kindness towards me.",
        "I also again met with Heine. He had married since I was last here. I\nfound him in indifferent health; but full of energy, and so friendly\nand so natural in his behavior towards me, that I felt no timidity in\nexhibiting myself to him as I was. One day he had been relating to his\nwife my story of the Constant Tin Soldier, and, whilst he said that I\nwas the author of this story, he introduced me to her. She was a\nlively, pretty young lady. A troop of children, who, as Heine says,\nbelonged to a neighbor, played about in their room. We two played with\nthem whilst Heine copied out one of his last poems for me.",
        "I perceived in him no pain-giving, sarcastic smile; I only heard the\npulsation of a German heart, which is always perceptible in the songs,\nand which must live.",
        "Through the means of the many people I was acquainted with here, among\nwhom I might enumerate many others, as, for instance, Kalkbrenner,\nGathy, &c., my residence in Paris was made very cheerful and rich in\npleasure. I did not feel myself like a stranger there: I met with a\nfriendly reception among the greatest and best. It was like a payment\nby anticipation of the talent which was in me, and through which they\nexpected that I would some time prove them not to have been mistaken.",
        "Whilst I was in Paris, I received from Germany, where already several\nof my works were translated and read, a delightful and encouraging\nproof of friendship. A German family, one of the most highly cultivated\nand amiable with whom I am acquainted, had read my writings with\ninterest, especially the little biographical sketch prefixed to Only a\nFiddler, and felt the heartiest goodwill towards me, with whom they\nwere then not personally acquainted. They wrote to me, expressed their\nthanks for my works and the pleasure they had derived from them, and\noffered me a kind welcome to their house if I would visit it on my\nreturn home. There was a something extremely cordial and natural in\nthis letter, which was the first that I received of this kind in Paris,\nand it also formed a remarkable contrast to that which was sent to me\nfrom my native land in the year 1833, when I was here for the first\ntime.",
        "In this way I found myself, through my writings, adopted, as it were,\ninto a family to which since then I gladly betake myself, and where I\nknow that it is not only as the poet, but as the man, that I am\nbeloved. In how many instances have I not experienced the same kindness\nin foreign countries! I will mention one for the sake of its\npeculiarity.",
        "There lived in Saxony a wealthy and benevolent family; the lady of the\nhouse read my romance of Only a Fiddler, and the impression of this\nbook was such that she vowed that, if ever, in the course of her life,\nshe should meet with a poor child which was possessed of great musical\ntalents, she would not allow it to perish as the poor Fiddler had done.\nA musician who had heard her say this, brought to her soon after, not\none, but two poor boys, assuring her of their talent, and reminding her\nof her promise. She kept her word: both boys were received into her\nhouse, were educated by her, and are now in the Conservatorium; the\nyoungest of them played before me, and I saw that his countenance was\nhappy and joyful. The same thing perhaps might have happened; the same\nexcellent lady might have befriended these children without my book\nhaving been written: but notwithstanding this, my book is now connected\nwith this as a link in the chain.",
        "On my return home from Paris, I went along the Rhine; I knew that the\npoet Frieligrath, to whom the King of Prussia had given a pension, was\nresiding in one of the Rhine towns. The picturesque character of his\npoems had delighted me extremely, and I wished to talk with him. I\nstopped at several towns on the Rhine, and inquired after him. In St.\nGoar, I was shown the house in which he lived. I found him sitting at\nhis writing table, and he appeared annoyed at being disturbed by a\nstranger. I did not mention my name; but merely said that I could not\npass St. Goar without paying my respects to the poet Frieligrath.",
        "“That is very kind of you,” said he, in a very cold tone; and then\nasked who I was.",
        "“We have both of us one and the same friend, Chamisso!” replied I, and\nat these words he leapt up exultantly.",
        "“You are then Andersen!” he exclaimed; threw his arms around my neck,\nand his honest eyes beamed with joy.",
        "“Now you will stop several days here,” said he. I told him that I could\nonly stay a couple of hours, because I was travelling with some of my\ncountrymen who were waiting for me.",
        "“You have a great many friends in little St. Goar,” said he; “it is but\na short time since I read aloud your novel of O. T. to a large circle;\none of these friends I must, at all events, fetch here, and you must\nalso see my wife. Yes, indeed, you do not know that you had something\nto do in our being married.”",
        "He then related to me how my novel, Only a Fiddler, had caused them to\nexchange letters, and then led to their acquaintance, which\nacquaintance had ended in their being a married couple. He called her,\nmentioned to her my name, and I was regarded as an old friend. Such\nmoments as these are a blessing; a mercy of God, a happiness–and how\nmany such, how various, have I not enjoyed!",
        "I relate all these, to me, joyful occurrences; they are facts in my\nlife: I relate them, as I formerly have related that which was\nmiserable, humiliating, and depressing; and if I have done so, in the\nspirit which operated in my soul, it will not be called pride or\nvanity;–neither of them would assuredly be the proper name for it. But\npeople may perhaps ask at home, Has Andersen then never been attacked\nin foreign countries? I must reply,–no!",
        "No regular attack has been made upon me, at least they have never at\nhome called my attention to any such, and therefore there certainly\ncannot have been anything of the kind;–with the exception of one which\nmade its appearance in Germany, but which originated in Denmark, at the\nvery moment when I was in Paris.",
        "A certain Mr. Boas made a journey at that time through Scandinavia, and\nwrote a book on the subject. In this he gave a sort of survey of Danish\nliterature, which he also published in the journal called Die\nGrenzboten; in this I was very severely handled as a man and as a poet.\nSeveral other Danish poets also, as for instance, Christian Winter,\nhave an equally great right to complain. Mr. Boas had drawn his\ninformation out of the miserable gossip of every-day life; his work\nexcited attention in Copenhagen, and nobody there would allow\nthemselves to be considered as his informants; nay even Holst the poet,\nwho, as may be seen from the work, travelled with him through Sweden,\nand had received him at his house in Copenhagen, on this occasion\npublished, in one of the most widely circulated of our papers, a\ndeclaration that he was in no way connected with Mr. Boas.",
        "Mr. Boas had in Copenhagen attached himself to a particular clique\nconsisting of a few young men; he had heard them full of lively\nspirits, talking during the day, of the Danish poets and their\nwritings; he had then gone home, written down what he had heard and\nafterwards published it in his work. This was, to use the mildest term,\ninconsiderate. That my Improvisatore and Only a Fiddler did not please\nhim, is a matter of taste, and to that I must submit myself. But when\nhe, before the whole of Germany, where probably people will presume\nthat what he has written is true, if he declare it to be, as is the\ncase, the universal judgment against me in my native land; when he, I\nsay, declared me before the whole of Germany, to be the most haughty of\nmen, he inflicts upon me a deeper wound than he perhaps imagined. He\nconveyed the voice of a party, formerly hostile to me, into foreign\ncountries. Nor is he true even in that which he represents; he gives\ncircumstances as facts, which never took place.",
        "In Denmark what he has written could not injure me, and many have\ndeclared themselves afraid of coming into contact with any one, who\nprinted everything which he heard. His book was read in Germany, the\npublic of which is now also mine; and I believe, therefore, that I may\nhere say how faulty is his view of Danish literature and Danish poets;\nin what manner his book was received in my native land and that people\nthere know in what way it was put together. But after I have expressed\nmyself thus on this subject I will gladly offer Mr. Boas my hand; and\nif, in his next visit to Denmark, no other poet will receive him, I\nwill do my utmost for him; I know that he will not be able to judge me\nmore severely when we know each other, than when we knew each other\nnot. His judgment would also have been quite of another character had\nhe come to Denmark but one year later; things changed very much in a\nyear’s time. Then the tide had turned in my favor; I then had published\nmy new children’s stories, of which from that moment to the present\nthere prevailed, through the whole of my native land, but one\nunchanging honorable opinion. When the edition of my collection of\nstories came out at Christmas 1843, the reaction began; acknowledgment\nof my merits were made, and favor shown me in Denmark, and from that\ntime I have no cause for complaint. I have obtained and I obtain in my\nown land that which I deserve, nay perhaps, much more.",
        "I will now turn to those little stories which in Denmark have been\nplaced by every one, without any hesitation, higher than anything else\nI had hitherto written.",
        "In the year 1835, some months after I published the Improvisatore, I\nbrought out my first volume of Stories for Children, [Footnote: I find\nit very difficult to give a correct translation of the original word.\nThe Danish is Eventyr, equivalent to the German Abentheur,\nor adventure; but adventures give in English a very different idea to this\nclass of stories. The German word Märchen, gives the meaning\ncompletely, and this we may English by fairy tale or legend, but\nthen neither of these words are fully correct with regard to Andersen’s\nstories. In my translation of his “Eventyr fortalte for Born,” I gave as\nan equivalent title, “Wonderful Stories for Children,” and perhaps this\nnear as I could come.–M. H.] which at that time was not so very much\nthought of. One monthly critical journal even complained that a young\nauthor who had just published a work like the Improvisatore, should\nimmediately come out with anything so childish as the tales. I reaped a\nharvest of blame, precisely where people ought to have acknowledged\nthe advantage of my mind producing something in a new direction.\nSeveral of my friends, whose judgment was of value to me, counselled\nme entirely to abstain from writing tales, as these were a something for\nwhich I had no talent. Others were of opinion that I had better, first of\nall, study the French fairy tale. I would willingly have discontinued\nwriting them, but they forced themselves from me.",
        "In the volume which I first published, I had, like Mus us, but in my\nown manner, related old stories, which I had heard as a child. The\nvolume concluded with one which was original, and which seemed to have\ngiven the greatest pleasure, although it bore a tolerably near affinity\nto a story of Hoffman’s. In my increasing disposition for children’s\nstories, I therefore followed my own impulse, and invented them mostly\nmyself. In the following year a new volume came out, and soon after\nthat a third, in which the longest story, The Little Mermaid, was my\nown invention. This story, in an especial manner, created an interest\nwhich was only increased by the following volumes. One of these came\nout every Christmas, and before long no Christmas tree could exist\nwithout my stones.",
        "Some of our first comic actors made the attempt of relating my little\nstories from the stage; it was a complete change from the declamatory\npoetry which had been heard to satiety. The Constant Tin Soldier,\ntherefore, the Swineherd, and the Top and Ball, were told from the\nRoyal stage, and from those of private theatres, and were well\nreceived. In order that the reader might be placed in the proper point\nof view, with regard to the manner in which I told the stories, I had\ncalled my first volume Stories told for Children. I had written my\nnarrative down upon paper, exactly in the language, and with the\nexpressions in which I had myself related them, by word of mouth, to\nthe little ones, and I had arrived at the conviction that people of\ndifferent ages were equally amused with them. The children made\nthemselves merry for the most part over what might be called the\nactors, older people, on the contrary, were interested in the deeper\nmeaning. The stories furnished reading for children and grown people,\nand that assuredly is a difficult task for those who will write\nchildren’s stories. They met with open doors and open hearts in\nDenmark; everybody read them. I now removed the words “told for\nchildren,” from my title, and published three volumes of “New Stories,\"\nall of which were of my own invention, and which were received in my\nown country with the greatest favor. I could not wish it greater; I\nfelt a real anxiety in consequence, a fear of not being able to justify\nafterwards such an honorable award of praise.",
        "A refreshing sunshine streamed into my heart; I felt courage and joy,\nand was filled, with a living desire of still more and more developing\nmy powers in this direction,–of studying more thoroughly this class of\nwriting, and of observing still more attentively the rich wells of\nnature out of which I must create it. If attention be paid to the order\nin which my stories are written, it certainly will be seen that there\nis in them a gradual progression, a clearer working out of the idea, a\ngreater discretion in the use of agency, and, if I may so speak,\na more healthy tone and a more natural freshness may be perceived.",
        "At this period of my life, I made an acquaintance which was of great\nmoral and intellectual importance to me. I have already spoken of\nseveral persons and public characters who have had influence on me as\nthe poet; but none of these have had more, nor in a nobler sense of the\nword, than the lady to whom I here turn myself; she, through whom I, at\nthe same time, was enabled to forget my own individual self, to feel\nthat which is holy in art, and to become acquainted with the command\nwhich God has given to genius.",
        "I now turn back to the year 1840. One day in the hotel in which I lived\nin Copenhagen, I saw the name of Jenny Lind among those of the\nstrangers from Sweden. I was aware at that time that she was the first\nsinger in Stockholm. I had been that same year, in this neighbor\ncountry, and had there met with honor and kindness: I thought,\ntherefore, that it would not be unbecoming in me to pay a visit to the\nyoung artist. She was, at this time, entirely unknown out of Sweden, so\nthat I was convinced that, even in Copenhagen, her name was known only\nby few. She received me very courteously, but yet distantly, almost\ncoldly. She was, as she said, on a journey with her father to South\nSweden, and was come over to Copenhagen for a few days in order that\nshe might see this city. We again parted distantly, and I had the\nimpression of a very ordinary character which soon passed away from my\nmind.",
        "In the autumn of 1843, Jenny Lind came again to Copenhagen. One of my\nfriends, our clever ballet-master, Bournonville, who has married a\nSwedish lady, a friend of Jenny Lind, informed me of her arrival here\nand told me that she remembered me very kindly, and that now she had\nread my writings. He entreated me to go with him to her, and to employ\nall my persuasive art to induce her to take a few parts at the Theatre\nRoyal; I should, he said, be then quite enchanted with what I should\nhear.",
        "I was not now received as a stranger; she cordially extended to me her\nhand, and spoke of my writings and of Miss Fredrika Bremer, who also\nwas her affectionate friend. The conversation was soon turned to her\nappearance in Copenhagen, and of this Jenny Lind declared that she\nstood in fear.",
        "“I have never made my appearance,” said she, “out of Sweden; everybody\nin my native land is so affectionate and kind to me, and if I made my\nappearance in Copenhagen and should be hissed!–I dare not venture on\nit!”",
        "I said, that I, it was true, could not pass judgment on her singing,\nbecause I had never heard it, neither did I know how she acted, but\nnevertheless, I was convinced that such was the disposition at this\nmoment in Copenhagen, that only a moderate voice and some knowledge of\nacting would be successful; I believed that she might safely venture.",
        "Bournonville’s persuasion obtained for the Copenhageners the greatest\nenjoyment which they ever had.",
        "Jenny Lind made her first appearance among them as Alice in Robert le\nDiable–it was like a new revelation in the realms of art, the\nyouthfully fresh voice forced itself into every heart; here reigned\ntruth and nature; everything was full of meaning and intelligence. At\none concert Jenny Lind sang her Swedish songs; there was something so\npeculiar in this, so bewitching; people thought nothing about the\nconcert room; the popular melodies uttered by a being so purely\nfeminine, and bearing the universal stamp of genius, exercised their\nomnipotent sway–the whole of Copenhagen was in raptures. Jenny Lind\nwas the first singer to whom the Danish students gave a serenade:\ntorches blazed around the hospitable villa where the serenade was\ngiven: she expressed her thanks by again singing some Swedish songs,\nand I then saw her hasten into the darkest corner and weep for emotion.",
        "“Yes, yes,” said she, “I will exert myself; I will endeavor, I will be\nbetter qualified than I am when I again come to Copenhagen.”",
        "On the stage, she was the great artiste, who rose above all those\naround her; at home, in her own chamber, a sensitive young girl with\nall the humility and piety of a child.",
        "Her appearance in Copenhagen made an epoch in the history of our opera;\nit showed me art in its sanctity–I had beheld one of its vestals. She\njourneyed back to Stockholm, and from there Fredrika Bremer wrote to\nme:–\"With regard to Jenny Lind as a singer, we are both of us\nperfectly agreed; she stands as high as any artist of our time can\nstand; but as yet you do not know her in her full greatness. Speak to\nher about her art, and you will wonder at the expansion of her mind,\nand will see her countenance beaming with inspiration. Converse then\nwith her of God, and of the holiness of religion, and you will see\ntears in those innocent eyes; she is great as an artist, but she is\nstill greater in her pure human existence!”",
        "In the following year I was in Berlin; the conversation with Meyerbeer\nturned upon Jenny Lind; he had heard her sing the Swedish songs, and\nwas transported by them.",
        "“But how does she act?” asked he.",
        "I spoke in raptures of her acting, and gave him at the same time some\nidea of her representation of Alice. He said to me that perhaps it\nmight be possible for him to determine her to come to Berlin.",
        "It is sufficiently well known that she made her appearance there, threw\nevery one into astonishment and delight, and won for herself in Germany\na European name. Last autumn she came again to Copenhagen, and the\nenthusiasm was incredible; the glory of renown makes genius perceptible\nto every one. People bivouacked regularly before the theatre, to obtain\na ticket. Jenny Lind appeared still greater than ever in her art,\nbecause they had an opportunity of seeing her in many and such\nextremely different parts. Her Norma is plastic; every attitude might\nserve as the most beautiful model to a sculptor, and yet people felt\nthat these were the inspiration of the moment, and had not been studied\nbefore the glass; Norma is no raving Italian; she is the suffering,\nsorrowing woman–the woman possessed of a heart to sacrifice herself\nfor an unfortunate rival–the woman to whom, in the violence of the\nmoment, the thought may suggest itself of murdering the children of a\nfaithless lover, but who is immediately disarmed when she gazes into\nthe eyes of the innocent ones.",
        "“Norma, thou holy priestess,” sings the chorus, and Jenny Lind has\ncomprehended and shows to us this holy priestess in the aria, Casta\ndiva. In Copenhagen she sang all her parts in Swedish, and the\nother singers sang theirs in Danish, and the two kindred languages\nmingled very beautifully together; there was no jarring; even in the\nDaughter of the Regiment where there is a deal of dialogue, the Swedish\nhad something agreeable–and what acting! nay, the word itself is a\ncontradiction–it was nature; anything as true never before appeared on\nthe stage. She shows us perfectly the true child of nature grown up in\nthe camp, but an inborn nobility pervades every movement. The Daughter\nof the Regiment and the Somnambule are certainly Jenny Land’s most\nunsurpassable parts; no second can take their places in these beside\nher. People laugh,–they cry; it does them as much good as going to\nchurch; they become better for it. People feel that God is in art; and\nwhere God stands before us face to face there is a holy church.",
        "“There will not in a whole century,” said Mendelssohn, speaking to me\nof Jenny Lind, “be born another being so gifted as she;” and his words\nexpressed my full conviction; one feels as she makes her appearance on\nthe stage, that she is a pure vessel, from which a holy draught will be\npresented to us.",
        "There is not anything which can lessen the impression which Jenny\nLind’s greatness on the stage makes, except her own personal character\nat home. An intelligent and child-like disposition exercises here its\nastonishing power; she is happy; belonging, as it were, no longer to\nthe world, a peaceful, quiet home, is the object of her thoughts–and\nyet she loves art with her whole soul, and feels her vocation in it. A\nnoble, pious disposition like hers cannot be spoiled by homage. On one\noccasion only did I hear her express her joy in her talent and her\nself-consciousness. It was during her last residence in Copenhagen.\nAlmost every evening she appeared either in the opera or at concerts;\nevery hour was in requisition. She heard of a society, the object of\nwhich was, to assist unfortunate children, and to take them out of the\nhands of their parents by whom they were misused, and compelled either\nto beg or steal, and to place them in other and better circumstances.\nBenevolent people subscribed annually a small sum each for their\nsupport, nevertheless the means for this excellent purpose were small.",
        "“But have I not still a disengaged evening?” said she; “let me give a\nnight’s performance for the benefit of these poor children; but we will\nhave double prices!”",
        "Such a performance was given, and returned large proceeds; when she was\ninformed of this, and, that by this means, a number of poor children\nwould be benefited for several years, her countenance beamed, and the\ntears filled her eyes.",
        "“It is however beautiful,” said she, “that I can sing so!”",
        "I value her with the whole feeling of a brother, and I regard myself as\nhappy that I know and understand such a spirit. God give to her that\npeace, that quiet happiness which she wishes for herself!",
        "Through Jenny Lind I first became sensible of the holiness there is in\nart; through her I learned that one must forget oneself in the service\nof the Supreme. No books, no men have had a better or a more ennobling\ninfluence on me as the poet, than Jenny Lind, and I therefore have\nspoken of her so long and so warmly here.",
        "I have made the happy discovery by experience, that inasmuch as art and\nlife are more clearly understood by me, so much more sunshine from\nwithout has streamed into my soul. What blessings have not compensated\nme for the former dark days! Repose and certainty have forced\nthemselves into my heart. Such repose can easily unite itself with the\nchanging life of travel; I feel myself everywhere at home, attach\nmyself easily to people, and they give me in return confidence and\ncordiality.",
        "In the summer of 1844 I once more visited North Germany. An\nintellectual and amiable family in Oldenburg had invited me in the most\nfriendly manner to spend some time at their house. Count von Rantzau-\nBreitenburg repeated also in his letters how welcome I should be to\nhim. I set out on the journey, and this journey was, if not one of my\nlongest, still one of my most interesting.",
        "I saw the rich marsh-land in its summer luxuriance, and made with\nRantzau several interesting little excursions. Breitenburg lies in the\nmiddle of woods on the river St÷r; the steam-voyage to Hamburg gives\nanimation to the little river; the situation is picturesque, and life\nin the castle itself is comfortable and pleasant. I could devote myself\nperfectly to reading and poetry, because I was just as free as the bird\nin the air, and I was as much cared for as if I had been a beloved\nrelation of the family. Alas it was the last time that I came hither;\nCount Rantzau had, even then, a presentiment of his approaching death.\nOne day we met in the garden; he seized my hand, pressed it warmly,\nexpressed his pleasure in my talents being acknowledged abroad, and his\nfriendship for me, adding, in conclusion, “Yes, my dear young friend,\nGod only knows but I have the firm belief that this year is the last\ntime when we two shall meet here; my days will soon have run out their\nfull course.” He looked at me with so grave an expression, that it\ntouched my heart deeply, but I knew not what to say. We were near to\nthe chapel; he opened a little gate between some thick hedges, and we\nstood in a little garden, in which was a turfed grave and a seat beside\nit.",
        "“Here you will find me, when you come the next time to Breitenburg,\"\nsaid he, and his sorrowful words were true. He died the following\nwinter in Wiesbaden. I lost in him a friend, a protector, a noble\nexcellent heart.",
        "When I, on the first occasion, went to Germany, I visited the Hartz and\nthe Saxon Switzerland. Goethe was still living. It was my most\nheartfelt wish to see him. It was not far from the Hartz to Weimar, but\nI had no letters of introduction to him, and, at that time, not one\nline of my writings was translated. Many persons had described Goethe\nto me as a very proud man, and the question arose whether indeed he\nwould receive me. I doubted it, and determined not to go to Weimar\nuntil I should have written some work which would convey my name to\nGermany. I succeeded in this, but alas, Goethe was already dead.",
        "I had made the acquaintance of his daughter-in-law Mrs. von Goethe,\nborn at Pogwitsch, at the house of Mendelssohn Bartholdy, in Leipsig,\non my return from Constantinople; this spirituelle lady received\nme with much kindness. She told me that her son Walter had been my\nfriend for a long time; that as a boy he had made a whole play out of\nmy Improvisatore; that this piece had been performed in Goethe’s house;\nand lastly, that Walter, had once wished to go to Copenhagen to make my\nacquaintance. I thus had now friends in Weimar.",
        "An extraordinary desire impelled me to see this city where Goethe,\nSchiller, Wieland, and Herder had lived, and from which so much light\nhad streamed forth over the world. I approached that land which had\nbeen rendered sacred by Luther, by the strife of the Minnesingers on\nthe Wartburg, and by the memory of many noble and great events.",
        "On the 24th of June, the birthday of the Grand Duke, I arrived a\nstranger in the friendly town. Everything indicated the festivity which\nwas then going forward, and the young prince was received with great\nrejoicing in the theatre, where a new opera was being given. I did not\nthink how firmly, the most glorious and the best of all those whom I\nhere saw around me, would grow into my heart; how many of my future\nfriends sat around me here–how dear this city would become to me–in\nGermany my second home. I was invited by Goethe’s worthy friend, the\nexcellent Chancellor M ller, and I met with the most cordial reception\nfrom him. By accident I here met on my first call, with the Kammerherr\nBeaulieu de Marconnay, whom I had known in Oldenburg; he was now placed\nin Weimar. He invited me to remove to his house. In the course of a few\nminutes I was his stationary guest, and I felt “it is good to be here.”",
        "There are people whom it only requires a few days to know and to love;\nI won in Beaulieu, in these few days, a friend, as I believe, for my\nwhole life. He introduced me into the family circle, the amiable\nchancellor received me equally cordially; and I who had, on my arrival,\nfancied myself quite forlorn, because Mrs. von Goethe and her son\nWalter were in Vienna, was now known in Weimar, and well received in\nall its circles.",
        "The reigning Grand Duke and Duchess gave me so gracious and kind a\nreception as made a deep impression upon me. After I had been\npresented, I was invited to dine, and soon after received an invitation\nto visit the hereditary Grand Duke and his lady, at the hunting seat of\nEttersburg, which stands high, and close to an extensive forest. The\nold fashioned furniture within the house, and the distant views from\nthe park into the Hartz mountains, produced immediately a peculiar\nimpression. All the young peasants had assembled at the castle to\ncelebrate the birthday of their beloved young Duke; climbing-poles,\nfrom which fluttered handkerchiefs and ribbons, were erected; fiddles\nsounded, and people danced merrily under the branches of the large and\nflowering limetrees. Sabbath splendor, contentment and happiness were\ndiffused over the whole.",
        "The young and but new married princely pair seemed to be united by true\nheartfelt sentiment. The heart must be able to forget the star on the\nbreast under which it beats, if its possessor wish to remain long free\nand happy in a court; and such a heart, certainly one of the noblest\nand best which beats, is possessed by Karl Alexander of Saxe-Weimar. I\nhad the happiness of a sufficient length of time to establish this\nbelief. During this, my first residence here, I came several times to\nthe happy Ettersburg. The young Duke showed me the garden and the tree\non the trunk of which Goethe, Schiller, and Wieland had cut their\nnames; nay even Jupiter himself had wished to add his to theirs, for\nhis thunder-bolt had splintered it in one of the branches.",
        "The intellectual Mrs. von Gross (Amalia Winter), Chancellor von M ller,\nwho was able livingly to unroll the times of Goethe and to explain his\nFaust, and the soundly honest and child-like minded Eckermann belonged\nto the circle at Ettersburg. The evenings passed like a spiritual\ndream; alternately some one read aloud; even I ventured, for the first\ntime in a foreign language to me, to read one of my own tales–the\nConstant Tin Soldier.",
        "Chancellor von M ller accompanied me to the princely burial-place,\nwhere Karl August sleeps with his glorious wife, not between Schiller\nand Goethe, as I believed when I wrote–\"the prince has made for\nhimself a rainbow glory, whilst he stands between the sun and the\nrushing waterfall.” Close beside the princely pair, who understood and\nvalued that which was great, repose these their immortal friends.\nWithered laurel garlands lay upon the simple brown coffins, of which\nthe whole magnificence consists in the immortal names of Goethe and\nSchiller. In life the prince and the poet walked side by side, in death\nthey slumber under the same vault. Such a place as this is never\neffaced from the mind; in such a spot those quiet prayers are offered,\nwhich God alone hears.",
        "I remained above eight days in Weimar; it seemed to me as if I had\nformerly lived in this city; as if it were a beloved home which I must\nnow leave. As I drove out of the city, over the bridge and past the\nmill, and for the last time looked back to the city and the castle, a\ndeep melancholy took hold on my soul, and it was to me as if a\nbeautiful portion of my life here had its close; I thought that the\njourney, after I had left Weimar, could afford me no more pleasure. How\noften since that time has the carrier pigeon, and still more\nfrequently, the mind, flown over to this place! Sunshine has streamed\nforth from Weimar upon my poet-life.",
        "From Weimar I went to Leipzig where a truly poetical evening awaited me\nwith Robert Schumann. This great composer had a year before surprised\nme by the honor of dedicating to me the music which he had composed to\nfour of my songs; the lady of Dr. Frege whose singing, so full of soul,\nhas pleased and enchanted so many thousands, accompanied Clara\nSchumann, and the composer and the poet were alone the audience: a\nlittle festive supper and a mutual interchange of ideas shortened the\nevening only too much. I met with the old, cordial reception at the\nhouse of Mr. Brockhaus, to which from former visits I had almost\naccustomed myself. The circle of my friends increased in the German\ncities; but the first heart is still that to which we most gladly turn\nagain.",
        "I found in Dresden old friends with youthful feelings; my gifted half-\ncountryman Dahl, the Norwegian, who knows how upon canvas to make the\nwaterfall rush foaming down, and the birch-tree to grow as in the\nvalleys of Norway, and Vogel von Vogelstein, who did me the honor of\npainting my portrait, which was included in the royal collection of\nportraits. The theatre intendant, Herr von L ttichau, provided me every\nevening with a seat in the manager’s box; and one of the noblest\nladies, in the first circles of Dresden, the worthy Baroness von\nDecken, received me as a mother would receive her son. In this\ncharacter I was ever afterwards received in her family and in the\namiable circle of her friends.",
        "How bright and beautiful is the world! How good are human beings! That\nit is a pleasure to live becomes ever more and more clear to me.",
        " Beaulieu’s younger brother Edmund, who is an officer in the army, came\none day from Tharand, where he had spent the summer months. I\naccompanied him to various places, spent some happy days among the\npleasant scenery of the hills, and was received at the same time into\nvarious families.",
        "I visited with the Baroness Decken, for the first time, the celebrated\nand clever painter Retsch, who has published the bold outlines of\nGoethe, Shakspeare, &c. He lives a sort of Arcadian life among lowly\nvineyards on the way to Meissen. Every year he makes a present to his\nwife, on her birthday, of a new drawing, and always one of his best;\nthe collection has grown through a course of years to a valuable album,\nwhich she, if he die before her, is to publish. Among the many glorious\nideas there, one struck me as peculiar; the Flight into Egypt. It is\nnight; every one sleeps in the picture,–Mary, Joseph, the flowers and\nthe shrubs, nay even the ass which carries her–all, except the child\nJesus, who, with open round countenance, watches over and illumines\nall. I related one of my stories to him, and for this I received a\nlovely drawing,–a beautiful young girl hiding herself behind the mask\nof an old woman; thus should the eternally youthful soul, with its\nblooming loveliness, peep forth from behind the old mask of the fairy-\ntale. Retsch’s pictures are rich in thought, full of beauty, and a\ngenial spirit.",
        "I enjoyed the country-life of Germany with Major Serre and his amiable\nwife at their splendid residence of Maren; it is not possible for any\none to exercise greater hospitality than is done by these two kind-\nhearted people. A circle of intelligent, interesting individuals, were\nhere assembled; I remained among them above eight days, and there\nbecame acquainted with Kohl the traveller, and the clever authoress,\nthe Countess Hahn-Hahn, in whom I discerned a woman by disposition and\nindividual character in whom confidence may be placed. Where one is\nwell received there one gladly lingers. I found myself unspeakably\nhappy on this little journey in Germany, and became convinced that I\nwas there no stranger. It was heart and truth to nature which people\nvalued in my writings; and, however excellent and praiseworthy the\nexterior beauty may be, however imposing the maxims of this world’s\nwisdom, still it is heart and nature which have least changed by time,\nand which everybody is best able to understand.",
        "I returned home by way of Berlin, where I had not been for several\nyears; but the dearest of my friends there–Chamisso, was dead.",
        "  The fair wild swan which flew far o’er the earth,\n  And laid its head upon a wild-swan’s breast,",
        "was now flown to a more glorious hemisphere; I saw his children, who\nwere now fatherless and motherless. From the young who here surround\nme, I discover that I am grown older; I feel it not in myself.\nChamisso’s sons, whom I saw the last time playing here in the little\ngarden with bare necks, came now to meet me with helmet and sword: they\nwere officers in the Prussian service. I felt in a moment how the years\nhad rolled on, how everything was changed and how one loses so many.",
        "  Yet is it not so hard as people deem,\n    To see their soul’s beloved from them riven;\n  God has their dear ones, and in death they seem\n    To form a bridge which leads them up to heaven.",
        "I met with the most cordial reception, and have since then always met\nwith the same, in the house of the Minister Savigny, where I became\nacquainted with the clever, singularly gifted Bettina and her lovely\nspiritual-minded daughter. One hour’s conversation with Bettina during\nwhich she was the chief speaker, was so rich and full of interest, that\nI was almost rendered dumb by all this eloquence, this firework of wit.\nThe world knows her writings, but another talent which she is possessed\nof, is less generally known, namely her talent for drawing. Here again\nit is the ideas which astonish us. It was thus, I observed, she had\ntreated in a sketch an accident which had occurred just before, a young\nman being killed by the fumes of wine. You saw him descending half-\nnaked into the cellar, round which lay the wine casks like monsters:\nBacchanals and Bacchantes danced towards him, seized their victim and\ndestroyed him! I know that Thorwaldsen, to whom she once showed all her\ndrawings, was in the highest degree astonished by the ideas they\ncontained.",
        "It does the heart such good when abroad to find a house, where, when\nimmediately you enter, eyes flash like festal lamps, a house where you\ncan take peeps into a quiet, happy domestic life–such a house is that\nof Professor Weiss. Yet how many new acquaintance which were found, and\nold acquaintance which were renewed, ought I not to mention! I met\nCornelius from Rome, Schelling from Munich, my countryman I might\nalmost call him; Steffens, the Norwegian, and once again Tieck, whom I\nhad not seen since my first visit to Germany. He was very much altered,\nyet his gentle, wise eyes were the same, the shake of his hand was the\nsame. I felt that he loved me and wished me well. I must visit him in\nPotsdam, where he lived in ease and comfort. At dinner I became\nacquainted with his brother the sculptor.",
        "From Tieck I learnt how kindly the King and Queen of Prussia were\ndisposed towards me; that they had read my romance of Only a Fiddler,\nand inquired from Tieck about me. Meantime their Majesties were absent\nfrom Berlin. I had arrived the evening before their departure, when\nthat abominable attempt was made upon their lives.",
        "I returned to Copenhagen by Stettin in stormy weather, full of the joy\nof life, and again saw my dear friends, and in a few days set off to\nCount Moltke’s in Funen, there to spend a few lovely summer days. I\nhere received a letter from the Minister Count Rantzau-Breitenburg, who\nwas with the King and Queen of Denmark at the watering-place of F÷hr.\nHe wrote, saying that he had the pleasure of announcing to me the most\ngracious invitation of their Majesties to F÷hr. This island, as is well\nknown, lies in the North Sea, not far from the coast of Sleswick, in\nthe neighborhood of the interesting Halligs, those little islands which\nBiernatzky described so charmingly in his novels. Thus, in a manner\nwholly unexpected by me, I should see scenery of a very peculiar\ncharacter even in Denmark.",
        "The favor of my king and Queen made me happy, and I rejoiced to be once\nmore in close intimacy with Rantzau. Alas, it was for the last time!",
        "It was just now five and twenty years since I, a poor lad, travelled\nalone and helpless to Copenhagen. Exactly the five and twentieth\nanniversary would be celebrated by my being with my king and queen, to\nwhom I was faithfully attached, and whom I at that very time learned to\nlove with my whole soul. Everything that surrounded me, man and nature,\nreflected themselves imperishably in my soul. I felt myself, as it\nwere, conducted to a point from which I could look forth more\ndistinctly over the past five and twenty years, with all the good\nfortune and happiness which they had evolved for me. The reality\nfrequently surpasses the most beautiful dream.",
        "I travelled from Funen to Flensborg, which, lying in its great bay, is\npicturesque with woods and hills, and then immediately opens out into a\nsolitary heath. Over this I travelled in the bright moonlight. The\njourney across the heath was tedious; the clouds only passed rapidly.\nWe went on monotonously through the deep sand, and monotonous was the\nwail of a bird among the shrubby heath. Presently we reached moorlands.\nLong-continued rain had changed meadows and cornfields into great\nlakes; the embankments along which we drove were like morasses; the\nhorses sank deeply into them. In many places the light carriage was\nobliged to be supported by the peasants, that it might not fall upon\nthe cottages below the embankment. Several hours were consumed over\neach mile (Danish). At length the North Sea with its islands lay before\nme. The whole coast was an embankment, covered for miles with woven\nstraw, against which the waves broke. I arrived at high tide. The wind\nwas favorable, and in less than an hour I reached F÷hr, which, after my\ndifficult journey, appeared to me like a real fairy land.",
        "The largest city, Wyck, in which are the baths, is exactly built like a\nDutch town. The houses are only one story high, with sloping roofs and\ngables turned to the street. The many strangers there, and the presence\nof the court, gave a peculiar animation to the principal street. Well-\nknown faces looked out from almost every house; the Danish flag waved,\nand music was heard. I was soon established in my quarters, and every\nday, until the departure of their Majesties, had I the honor of an\ninvitation from them to dinner, as well as to pass the evening in their\ncircle. On several evenings I read aloud my little stories (M rchen) to\nthe king and queen, and both of them were gracious and affectionate\ntowards me. It is so good when a noble human nature will reveal itself\nwhere otherwise only the king’s crown and the purple mantle might be\ndiscovered. Few people can be more amiable in private life than their\npresent Majesties of Denmark. May God bless them and give them joy,\neven as they filled my breast with happiness and sunshine!",
        "I sailed in their train to the largest of the Halligs, those grassy\nrunes in the ocean, which bear testimony to a sunken country. The\nviolence of the sea has changed the mainland into islands, has riven\nthese again, and buried men and villages. Year after year are new\nportions rent away, and, in half a century’s time, there will be\nnothing here but sea. The Halligs are now only low islets covered with\na dark turf, on which a few flocks graze. When the sea rises these are\ndriven into the garrets of the houses, and the waves roll over this\nlittle region, which is miles distant from the shore. Oland, which we\nvisited, contains a little town. The houses stand closely side by side,\nas if, in their sore need they would all huddle together. They are all\nerected upon a platform, and have little windows, as in the cabin of a\nship. There, in the little room, solitary through half the year, sit\nthe wife and her daughters spinning. There, however, one always finds a\nlittle collection of books. I found books in Danish, German, and\nFrieslandish. The people read and work, and the sea rises round the\nhouses, which lie like a wreck in the ocean. Sometimes, in the night, a\nship, having mistaken the lights, drives on here and is stranded.",
        "In the year 1825, a tempestuous tide washed away men and houses. The\npeople sat for days and nights half naked upon the roofs, till these\ngave way; nor from F÷hr nor the mainland could help be sent to them.\nThe church-yard is half washed away; coffins and corpses were\nfrequently exposed to view by the breakers: it is an appalling sight.\nAnd yet the inhabitants of the Halligs are attached to their little\nhome. They cannot remain on the mainland, but are driven thence by home\nsickness.",
        "We found only one man upon the island, and he had only lately arisen\nfrom a sick bed. The others were out on long voyages. We were received\nby girls and women. They had erected before the church a triumphal arch\nwith flowers which they had fetched from F÷hr; but it was so small and\nlow, that one was obliged to go round it; nevertheless they showed by\nit their good will. The queen was deeply affected by their having cut\ndown their only shrub, a rose bush, to lay over a marshy place which\nshe would have to cross. The girls are pretty, and are dressed in a\nhalf Oriental fashion. The people trace their descent from Greeks. They\nwear their faces half concealed, and beneath the strips of linen which\nlie upon the head is placed a Greek fez, around which the hair is wound\nin plaits.",
        "On our return, dinner was served on board the royal steamer; and\nafterwards, as we sailed in a glorious sunset through this archipelago,\nthe deck of the vessel was changed to a dancing room. Young and old\ndanced; servants flew hither and thither with refreshments; sailors\nstood upon the paddle-boxes and took the soundings, and their deep-\ntoned voices might be heard giving the depth of the water. The moon\nrose round and large, and the promontory of Amrom assumed the\nappearance of a snow-covered chain of Alps.",
        "I visited afterwards these desolate sand hills: the king went to shoot\nrabbits there. Many years ago a ship was wrecked here, on board of\nwhich were two rabbits, and from this pair Amrom is now stored with\nthousands of their descendants. At low tide the sea recedes wholly from\nbetween Amrom and F÷hr, and then people drive across from one island to\nanother; but still the time must be well observed and the passage\naccurately known, or else, when the tide comes, he who crosses will be\ninevitably lost. It requires only a few minutes, and then where dry\nland was large ships may sail. We saw a whole row of wagons driving\nfrom F÷hr to Amrom. Seen upon the white sand and against the blue\nhorizon, they seem to be twice as large as they really were. All around\nwere spread out, like a net, the sheets of water, as if they held\nfirmly the extent of sand which belonged to the ocean and which would\nbe soon overflowed by it. This promontory brings to one’s memory the\nmounds of ashes at Vesuvius; for here one sinks at every step, the wiry\nmoor-grass not being able to bind together the loose sand. The sun\nshone burningly hot between the white sand hills: it was like a journey\nthrough the deserts of Africa.",
        "A peculiar kind of rose, and the heath were in flower in the valleys\nbetween the hills; in other places there was no vegetation whatever;\nnothing but the wet sand on which the waves had left their impress; the\nsea had inscribed on its receding strange hieroglyphics. I gazed from\none of the highest points over the North Sea; it was ebb-tide; the sea\nhad retired above a mile; the vessels lay like dead fishes upon the\nsand, and awaiting the returning tide. A few sailors had clambered down\nand moved about on the sandy ground like black points. Where the sea\nitself kept the white level sand in movement, a long bank elevated\nitself, which, during the time of high-water, is concealed, and upon\nwhich occur many wrecks. I saw the lofty wooden tower which is here\nerected, and in which a cask is always kept filled with water, and a\nbasket supplied with bread and brandy, that the unfortunate human\nbeings, who are here stranded, may be able in this place, amid the\nswelling sea, to preserve life for a few days until it is possible to\nrescue them.",
        "To return from such a scene as this to a royal table, a charming court-\nconcert, and a little ball in the bath-saloon, as well as to the\npromenade by moonlight, thronged with guests, a little Boulevard, had\nsomething in it like a fairy tale,–it was a singular contrast.",
        "As I sat on the above-mentioned five-and-twentieth anniversary, on the\n5th of September, at the royal dinner-table, the whole of my former\nlife passed in review before my mind. I was obliged to summon all my\nstrength to prevent myself bursting into tears. There are moments of\nthankfulness in which, as it were, we feel a desire to press God to our\nhearts. How deeply I felt, at this time, my own nothingness; how all,\nall, had come from him. Rantzau knew what an interesting day this was\nto me. After dinner the king and the queen wished me happiness, and\nthat so–graciously, is a poor word,–so cordially, so sympathizingly!\nThe king wished me happiness in that which I had endured and won. He\nasked me about my first entrance into the world, and I related to him\nsome characteristic traits.",
        "In the course of conversation he inquired if I had not some certain\nyearly income; I named the sum to him.",
        "“That is not much,” said the king.",
        "“But I do not require much,” replied I, “and my writings procure me\nsomething.”",
        "The king, in the kindest manner, inquired farther into my\ncircumstances, and closed by saying,",
        "“If I can, in any way, be serviceable to your literary labors, then\ncome to me.”",
        "In the evening, during the concert, the conversation was renewed, and\nsome of those who stood near me reproached me for not having made use\nof my opportunity.",
        "“The king,” said they, “put the very words into your mouth.”",
        "But I could not, I would not have done it. “If the king,” I said,\n\"found that I required something more, he could give it to me of his\nown will.”",
        "And I was not mistaken. In the following year King Christian VIII.\nincreased my annual stipend, so that with this and that which my\nwritings bring in, I can live honorably and free from care. My king\ngave it to me out of the pure good-will of his own heart. King\nChristian is enlightened, clear-sighted, with a mind enlarged by\nscience; the gracious sympathy, therefore, which he has felt in my fate\nis to me doubly cheering and ennobling.",
        "The 5th of September was to me a festival-day; even the German visitors\nat the baths honored me by drinking my health in the pump-room.",
        "So many flattering circumstances, some people argue, may easily spoil a\nman, and make him vain. But, no; they do not spoil him, they make him\non the contrary–better; they purify his mind, and he must thereby feel\nan impulse, a wish, to deserve all that he enjoys. At my parting-\naudience with the queen, she gave me a valuable ring as a remembrance\nof our residence at F÷hr; and the king again expressed himself full of\nkindness and noble sympathy. God bless and preserve this exalted pair!",
        "The Duchess of Augustenburg was at this time also at F÷hr with her two\neldest daughters. I had daily the happiness of being with them, and\nreceived repeated invitations to take Augustenburg on my return. For\nthis purpose I went from F÷hr to Als, one of the most beautiful islands\nin the Baltic. That little region resembles a blooming garden;\nluxuriant corn and clover-fields are enclosed, with hedges of hazels\nand wild roses; the peasants’ houses are surrounded by large apple-\norchards, full of fruit. Wood and hill alternate. Now we see the ocean,\nand now the narrow Lesser Belt, which resembles a river. The Castle of\nAugustenburg is magnificent, with its garden full of flowers, extending\ndown to the very shores of the serpentine bay. I met with the most\ncordial reception, and found the most amiable family-life in the ducal\ncircle. I spent fourteen days here, and was present at the birth-day\nfestivities of the duchess, which lasted three days; among these\nfestivities was racing, and the town and the castle were filled with\npeople.",
        "Happy domestic life is like a beautiful summer’s evening; the heart is\nfilled with peace; and everything around derives a peculiar glory. The\nfull heart says “it is good to be here;” and this I felt at\nAugustenburg.",
        "In the spring of 1844 I had finished a dramatic tale, “The Flower of\nFortune.” The idea of this was, that it is not the immortal name of the\nartist, nor the splendor of a crown which can make man happy; but that\nhappiness is to be found where people, satisfied with little, love and\nare loved again. The scene was perfectly Danish, an idyllian, sunbright\nlife, in whose clear heaven two dark pictures are reflected as in a\ndream; the unfortunate Danish poet Ewald and Prince Buris, who is\ntragically sung of in our heroic ballads. I wished to show, in honor of\nour times, the middle ages to have been dark and miserable, as they\nwere, but which many poets only represent to us in a beautiful light.",
        "Professor Heiberg, who was appointed censor, declared himself against\nthe reception of my piece. During the last years I had met with nothing\nbut hostility from this party; I regarded it as personal ill-will, and\nthis was to me still more painful than the rejection of the pieces. It\nwas painful for me to be placed in a constrained position with regard\nto a poet whom I respected, and towards whom, according to my own\nconviction, I had done everything in order to obtain a friendly\nrelationship. A further attempt, however, must be made. I wrote to\nHeiberg, expressed myself candidly, and, as I thought, cordially, and\nentreated him to give me explicitly the reasons for his rejection of\nthe piece and for his ill-will towards me. He immediately paid me a\nvisit, which I, not being at home when he called, returned on the\nfollowing day, and I was received in the most friendly manner. The\nvisit and the conversation belong certainly to the extraordinary, but\nthey occasioned an explanation, and I hope led to a better\nunderstanding for the future.",
        "He clearly set before me his views in the rejection of my piece. Seen\nfrom his point of sight they were unquestionably correct; but they were\nnot mine, and thus we could not agree. He declared decidedly that he\ncherished no spite against me, and that he acknowledged my talent. I\nmentioned his various attacks upon me, for example, in the\nIntelligence, and that he had denied to me original invention: I\nimagined, however, that I had shown this in my novels; “But of these,\"\nsaid I, “you have read none; you, yourself have told me so.”",
        "“Yes, that is the truth,” replied he; “I have not yet read them, but I\nwill do so.”",
        "“Since then,” continued I, “you have turned me and my Bazaar to\nridicule in your poem called Denmark, and spoken about my fanaticism\nfor the beautiful Dardanelles; and yet I have, precisely in that book,\ndescribed the Dardanelles as not beautiful; it is the Bosphorus which I\nthought beautiful; you seem not to be aware of that; perhaps you have\nnot read The Bazaar either?”",
        "“Was it the Bosphorus?” said he, with his own peculiar smile; “yes, I\nhad quite forgotten that, and, you see, people do not remember it\neither; the object in this case was only to give you a stab.”",
        "This confession sounded so natural, so like him, that I was obliged to\nsmile. I looked into his clever eyes, thought how many beautiful things\nhe had written, and I could not be angry with him. The conversation\nbecame more lively, more free, and he said many kind things to me; for\nexample, he esteemed my stories very highly, and entreated me\nfrequently to visit him. I have become more and more acquainted with\nhis poetical temperament, and I fancy that he too will understand mine.\nWe are very dissimilar, but we both strive after the same object.\nBefore we separated he conducted me to his little observatory; now his\ndearest world. He seems now to live for poetry and now for philosophy,\nandùfor  which I fancy he is least of all calculated–for astronomy. I\ncould almost sigh and sing,",
        "  Thou wast erewhile the star at which them gazest now!",
        "My dramatic story came at length on the stage, and in the course of the\nseason was performed seven times.",
        "As people grow older, however much they may be tossed about in the\nworld, some one place must be the true home; even the bird of passage\nhas one fixed spot to which it hastens; mine was and is the house of my\nfriend Collin. Treated as a son, almost grown up with the children, I\nhave become a member of the family; a more heartfelt connection, a\nbetter home have I never known: a link broke in this chain, and\nprecisely in the hour of bereavement, did I feel how firmly I have been\nengrafted here, so that I was regarded as one of the children.",
        " If I were to give the picture of the mistress of a family who wholly\nloses her own individual I in her husband and children, I must\nname the wife of Collin; with the sympathy of a mother, she also\nfollowed me in sorrow and in gladness. In the latter years of her life\nshe became very deaf, and besides this she had the misfortune of being\nnearly blind. An operation was performed on her sight, which succeeded\nso well, that in the course of the winter she was able to read a\nletter, and this was a cause of grateful joy to her. She longed in an\nextraordinary manner for the first green of spring, and this she saw in\nher little garden.",
        "I parted from her one Sunday evening in health and joy; in the night I\nwas awoke; a servant brought me a letter. Collin wrote, “My wife is\nvery ill; the children are all assembled here!” I understood it, and\nhastened thither. She slept quietly and without pain; it was the sleep\nof the just; it was death which was approaching so kindly and calmly.\nOn the third day she yet lay in that peaceful slumber: then her\ncountenance grew pale–and she was dead!",
        "  Thou didst but close thine eyes to gather in\n    The large amount of all thy spiritual bliss;\n  We saw thy slumbers like a little child’s.\n     O death! thou art all brightness and not shadow.",
        "Never had I imagined that the departure from this world could be so\npainless, so blessed. A devotion arose in my soul; a conviction of God\nand eternity, which this moment elevated to an epoch in my life. It was\nthe first death-bed at which I had been present since my childhood.\nChildren, and children’s children were assembled. In such moments all\nis holy around us. Her soul was love; she went to love and to God!",
        "At the end of July, the monument of King Frederick VI. was to be\nuncovered at Skanderburg, in the middle of Jutland. I had, by\nsolicitation, written the cantata for the festival, to which Hartmann\nhad furnished the music, and this was to be sung by Danish students. I\nhad been invited to the festival, which thus was to form the object of\nmy summer excursion.",
        "Skanderburg lies in one of the most beautiful districts of Denmark.\nAgreeable hills rise covered with vast beech-woods, and a large inland\nlake of a pleasing form extends among them. On the outside of the city,\nclose by the church, which is built upon the ruins of an old castle,\nnow stands the monument, a work of Thorwaldsen’s. The most beautiful\nmoment to me at this festival was in the evening, after the unveiling\nof the monument; torches were lighted around it, and threw their\nunsteady flame over the lake; within the woods blazed thousands of\nlights, and music for the dance resounded from the tents. Round about\nupon the hills, between the woods, and high above them, bonfires were\nlighted at one and the same moment, which burned in the night like red\nstars. There was spread over lake and land a pure, a summer fragrance\nwhich is peculiar to the north, in its beautiful summer nights. The\nshadows of those who passed between the monument and the church, glided\ngigantically along its red walls, as if they were spirits who were\ntaking part in the festival.",
        "I returned home. In this year my novel of the Improvisatore was\ntranslated into English, by the well-known authoress, Mary Howitt, and\nwas received by her countrymen with great applause. O. T. and the\nFiddler soon followed, and met with, as it seemed, the same reception.\nAfter that appeared a Dutch, and lastly a Russian translation of the\nImprovisatore. That which should never have ventured to have dreamed of\nwas accomplished; my writings seem to come forth under a lucky star;\nthey fly over all lands. There is something elevating, but at the same\ntime, a something terrific in seeing one’s thoughts spread so far, and\namong so many people; it is indeed, almost a fearful thing to belong to\nso many. The noble and the good in us becomes a blessing; but the bad,\none’s errors, shoot forth also, and involuntarily the thought forces\nitself from us: God! let me never write down a word of which I shall\nnot be able to give an account to thee. A peculiar feeling, a mixture\nof joy and anxiety, fills my heart every time my good genius conveys my\nfictions to a foreign people.",
        "Travelling operates like an invigorating bath to the mind; like a\nMedea-draft which always makes young again. I feel once more an impulse\nfor it–not in order to seek up material, as a critic fancied and said,\nin speaking of my Bazaar; there exists a treasury of material in my own\ninner self, and this life is too short to mature this young existence;\nbut there needs refreshment of spirit in order to convey it vigorously\nand maturely to paper, and travelling is to me, as I have said, this\ninvigorating bath, from which I return as it were younger and stronger.",
        "By prudent economy, and the proceeds of my writings, I was in a\ncondition to undertake several journeys during the last year. That\nwhich for me is the most sunbright, is the one in which these pages\nwere written. Esteem, perhaps over-estimation, but especially kindness,\nin short, happiness and pleasure have flowed towards me in abundant\nmeasure.",
        "I wished to visit Italy for the third time, there to spend a summer,\nthat I might become acquainted with the south in its warm season, and\nprobably return thence by Spain and France. At the end of October,\n1845, I left Copenhagen. Formerly I had thought when I set out on a\njourney, God! what wilt thou permit to happen to me on this journey!\nThis time my thoughts were, God, what will happen to my friends at home\nduring this long time! And I felt a real anxiety. In one year the\nhearse may drive up to the door many times, and whose name may shine\nupon the coffin! The proverb says, when one suddenly feels a cold\nshudder, “now death passes over my grave.” The shudder is still colder\nwhen the thoughts pass over the graves of our best friends.",
        "I spent a few days at Count Moltke’s, at Glorup; strolling players were\nacting some of my dramatic works at one of the nearest provincial\ntowns. I did not see them; country life firmly withheld me. There is\nsomething in the late autumn poetically beautiful; when the leaf is\nfallen from the tree, and the sun shines still upon the green grass,\nand the bird twitters, one may often fancy that it is a spring-day;\nthus certainly also has the old man moments in his autumn in which his\nheart dreams of spring.",
        "I passed only one day in Odense–I feel myself there more of a stranger\nthan in the great cities of Germany. As a child I was solitary, and had\ntherefore no youthful friend; most of the families whom I knew have\ndied out; a new generation passes along the streets; and the streets\neven are altered. The later buried have concealed the miserable graves\nof my parents. Everything is changed. I took one of my childhood’s\nrambles to the Marian-heights which had belonged to the Iversen family;\nbut this family is dispersed; unknown faces looked out from the\nwindows. How many youthful thoughts have been here exchanged!",
        "One of the young girls who at that time sat quietly there with beaming\neyes and listened to my first poem, when I came here in the summer time\nas a scholar from Slagelse, sits now far quieter in noisy Copenhagen,\nand has thence sent out her first writings into the world. Her German\npublisher thought that some introductory words from me might be useful\nto them, and I, the stranger, but the almost too kindly received, have\nintroduced the works of this clever girl into Germany.",
        "It is Henriette Hanck of whom I speak, the authoress of “Aunt Anna,\"\nand “An Author’s Daughter.” [Footnote: Since these pages were written,\nI have received from home the news of her death, in July, 1846. She was\nan affectionate daughter to her parents, and was, besides this,\npossessed of a deeply poetical mind. In her I have lost a true friend\nfrom the years of childhood, one who had felt an interest and a\nsisterly regard for me, both in my good and my evil days.] I visited\nher birth-place when the first little circle paid me homage and gave me\njoy. But all was strange there, I myself a stranger.",
        "The ducal family of Augustenburg was now at Castle Gravenstein; they\nwere informed of my arrival, and all the favor and the kindness which\nwas shown to me on the former occasion at Augustenburg, was here\nrenewed in rich abundance. I remained here fourteen days, and it was as\nif these were an announcement of all the happiness which should meet me\nwhen I arrived in Germany. The country around here is of the most\npicturesque description; vast woods, cultivated uplands in perpetual\nvariety, with the winding shore of the bay and the many quiet inland\nlakes. Even the floating mists of autumn lent to the landscape a some\nwhat picturesque, something strange to the islander. Everything here is\non a larger scale than on the island. Beautiful was it without,\nglorious was it within. I wrote here a new little story. The Girl with\nthe Brimstone-matches; the only thing which I wrote upon this journey.\nReceiving the invitation to come often to Gravenstein and Augustenburg,\nI left, with a grateful heart, a place where I had spent such beautiful\nand such happy days.",
        "Now, no longer the traveller goes at a snail’s pace through the deep\nsand over the heath; the railroad conveys him in a few hours to Altona\nand Hamburg. The circle of my friends there is increased within the\nlast years. The greater part of my time I spent with my oldest friends\nCount Hoik, and the resident Minister Bille, and with Zeise, the\nexcellent translator of my stories. Otto Speckter, who is full of\ngenius, surprised me by his bold, glorious drawings for my stories; he\nhad made a whole collection of them, six only of which were known to\nme. The same natural freshness which shows itself in every one of his\nworks, and makes them all little works of art, exhibits itself in his\nwhole character. He appears to possess a patriarchal family, an\naffectionate old father, and gifted sisters, who love him with their\nwhole souls. I wished one evening to go to the theatre; it was scarcely\na quarter of an hour before the commencement of the opera: Speckter\naccompanied me, and on our way we came up to an elegant house.",
        "“We must first go in here, dear friend,” said he; “a wealthy family\nlives here, friends of mine, and friends of your stories; the children\nwill be happy.”",
        "“But the opera,” said I.",
        "“Only for two minutes,” returned he; and drew me into the house,\nmentioned my name, and the circle of children collected around me.",
        "“And now tell us a tale,” said he; “only one.”",
        "I told one, and then hastened away to the theatre.",
        "“That was an extraordinary visit,” said I.",
        "“An excellent one; one entirely out of the common way; one entirely out\nof the common way!” said he exultingly; “only think; the children are\nfull of Andersen and his stories; he suddenly makes his appearance\namongst them, tells one of them himself, and then is gone! vanished!\nThat is of itself like a fairy-tale to the children, that will remain\nvividly in their remembrance.”",
        "I myself was amused by it.",
        "In Oldenburg my own little room, home-like and comfortable, was\nawaiting me. Hofrath von Eisendecker and his well-informed lady, whom,\namong all my foreign friends I may consider as my most sympathizing,\nexpected me. I had promised to remain with them a fortnight, but I\nstayed much longer. A house where the best and the most intellectual\npeople of a city meet, is an agreeable place of residence, and such a\none had I here. A deal of social intercourse prevailed in the little\ncity, and the theatre, in which certainly either opera or ballet was\ngiven, is one of the most excellent in Germany. The ability of Gall,\nthe director, is sufficiently known, and unquestionably the\nnominationof the poet Mosen has a great and good influence. I have to\nthank him for enabling me to see one of the classic pieces of Germany,\n\"Nathan the Wise,” the principal part in which was played by Kaiser,\nwho is as remarkable for his deeply studied and excellent tragic\nacting, as for his readings.",
        "Moses, who somewhat resembles Alexander Dumas, with his half African\ncountenance, and brown sparkling eyes, although he was suffering in\nbody, was full of life and soul, and we soon understood one another. A\ntrait of his little son affected me. He had listened to me with great\ndevotion, as I read one of my stories; and when on the last day I was\nthere, I took leave, the mother said that he must give me his hand,\nadding, that probably a long time must pass before he would see me\nagain, the boy burst into tears. In the evening, when Mosen came into\nthe theatre, he said to me, “My little Erick has two tin soldiers; one\nof them he has given me for you, that you may take him with you on your\njourney.”",
        "The tin soldier has faithfully accompanied me; he is a Turk: probably\nsome day he may relate his travels.",
        "Mosen wrote in the dedication of his “John of Austria,” the following\nlines to me:–",
        "  Once a little bird flew over\n    From the north sea’s dreary strand;\n  Singing, flew unto me over,\n    Singing M rchen through the land.\n  Farewell! yet again bring hither\n    Thy warm heart and song together.",
        "Here I again met with Mayer, who has described Naples and the\nNeapolitans so charmingly. My little stories interested him so much\nthat he had written a little treaties on them for Germany,\nKapellmeister Pott, and my countryman Jerndorff, belong to my earlier\nfriends. I made every day new acquaintance, because all houses were\nopen to me through the family with whom I was staying. Even the Grand\nDuke was so generous as to have me invited to a concert at the palace\nthe day after my arrival, and later I had the honor of being asked to\ndinner. I received in this foreign court, especially, many unlooked-for\nfavors. At the Eisendeckers and at the house of the parents of my\nfriend Beaulieu–the Privy-Counsellor Beaulieu, at Oldenburg, I heard\nseveral times my little stones read in German.",
        "I can read Danish very well, as it ought to be read, and I can give to\nit perfectly the expression which ought to be given in reading; there\nis in the Danish language a power which cannot be transfused into a\ntranslation; the Danish language is peculiarly excellent for this\nspecies of fiction. The stories have a something strange to me in\nGerman; it is difficult for me in reading it to put my Danish soul into\nit; my pronunciation of the German also is feeble, and with particular\nwords I must, as it were, use an effort to bring them out–and yet\npeople everywhere in Germany have had great interest in hearing me read\nthem aloud. I can very well believe that the foreign pronunciation in\nthe reading of these tales may be easily permitted, because this\nforeign manner approaches, in this instance, to the childlike; it gives\na natural coloring to the reading. I saw everywhere that the most\ndistinguished men and women of the most highly cultivated minds,\nlistened to me with interest; people entreated me to read, and I did so\nwillingly. I read for the first time my stories in a foreign tongue,\nand at a foreign court, before the Grand Duke of Oldenburg and a little\nselect circle.",
        "The winter soon came on; the meadows which lay under water, and which\nformed large lakes around the city, were already covered with thick\nice; the skaters flew over it, and I yet remained in Oldenburg among my\nhospitable friends. Days and evenings slid rapidly away; Christmas\napproached, and this season I wished to spend in Berlin. But what are\ndistances in our days?–the steam-carriage goes from Hanover to Berlin\nin one day! I must away from the beloved ones, from children and old\npeople, who were near, as it were, to my heart.",
        "I was astonished in the highest degree on taking leave of the Grand\nDuke, to receive from him, as a mark of his favor and as a keepsake, a\nvaluable ring. I shall always preserve it, like every other remembrance\nof this country, where I have found and where I possess true friends.",
        "When I was in Berlin on the former occasion, I was invited, as the\nauthor of the Improvisatore, to the Italian Society, into which only\nthose who have visited Italy can be admitted. Here I saw Rauch for the\nfirst time, who with his white hair and his powerful, manly figure, is\nnot unlike Thorwaldsen. Nobody introduced me to him, and I did not\nventure to present myself, and therefore walked alone about his studio,\nlike the other strangers. Afterwards I became personally acquainted\nwith him at the house of the Prussian Ambassador, in Copenhagen; I now\nhastened to him.",
        "He was in the highest degree captivated by my little stories, pressed\nme to his breast, and expressed the highest praise, but which was\nhonestly meant. Such a momentary estimation or over-estimation from a\nman of genius erases many a dark shadow from the mind. I received from\nRauch my first welcome in Berlin: he told me what a large circle of\nfriends I had in the capital of Prussia. I must acknowledge that it was\nso. They were of the noblest in mind as well as the first in rank, in\nart, and in science. Alexander von Humboldt, Prince Radziwil, Savigny,\nand many others never to be forgotten.",
        "I had already, on the former occasion, visited the brothers Grimm, but\nI had not at that time made much progress with the acquaintance. I had\nnot brought any letters of introduction to them with me, because people\nhad told me, and I myself believed it, that if I were known by any body\nin Berlin, it must be the brothers Grimm. I therefore sought out their\nresidence. The servant-maid asked me with which of the brothers I\nwished to speak.",
        "“With the one who has written the most,” said I, because I did not\nknow, at that time, which of them had most interested himself in the\nM rchen.",
        "“Jacob is the most learned,” said the maidservant.",
        "“Well, then, take me to him.”",
        "I entered the room, and Jacob Grimm, with his knowing and strongly-\nmarked countenance, stood before me.",
        "“I come to you,” said I, “without letters of introduction, because I\nhope that my name is not wholly unknown to you.”",
        "“Who are you?” asked he.",
        "I told him, and Jacob Grimm said, in a half-embarrassed voice, “I do\nnot remember to have heard this name; what have you written?”",
        "It was now my turn to be embarrassed in a high degree: but I now\nmentioned my little stories.",
        "“I do not know them,” said he; “but mention to me some other of your\nwritings, because I certainly must have heard them spoken of.”",
        "I named the titles of several; but he shook his head. I felt myself\nquite unlucky.",
        "“But what must you think of me,” said I, “that I come to you as a total\nstranger, and enumerate myself what I have written: you must know me!\nThere has been published in Denmark a collection of the M rchen of all\nnations, which is dedicated to you, and in it there is at least one\nstory of mine.”",
        "“No,” said he good-humoredly, but as much embarrassed as myself; “I\nhave not read even that, but it delights me to make your acquaintance;\nallow me to conduct you to my brother Wilhelm?”",
        "“No, I thank you,” said I, only wishing now to get away; I had fared\nbadly enough with one brother. I pressed his hand and hurried from the\nhouse.",
        "That same month Jacob Grimm went to Copenhagen; immediately on his\narrival, and while yet in his travelling dress, did the amiable kind\nman hasten up to me. He now knew me, and he came to me with cordiality.\nI was just then standing and packing my clothes in a trunk for a\njourney to the country; I had only a few minutes time: by this means my\nreception of him was just as laconic as had been his of me in Berlin.",
        "Now, however, we met in Berlin as old acquaintance. Jacob Grimm is one\nof those characters whom one must love and attach oneself to.",
        "One evening, as I was reading one of my little stories at the Countess\nBismark-Bohlen’s, there was in the little circle one person in\nparticular who listened with evident fellowship of feeling, and who\nexpressed himself in a peculiar and sensible manner on the subject,–\nthis was Jacob’s brother, Wilhelm Grimm.",
        "“I should have known you very well, if you had come to me,” said he,\n\"the last time you were here.”",
        "I saw these two highly-gifted and amiable brothers almost daily; the\ncircles into which I was invited seemed also to be theirs, and it was\nmy desire and pleasure that they should listen to my little stories,\nthat they should participate in them, they whose names will be always\nspoken as long as the German Volks M rchen are read.",
        "The fact of my not being known to Jacob Grimm on my first visit to\nBerlin, had so disconcerted me, that when any one asked me whether I\nhad been well received in this city, I shook my head doubtfully and\nsaid, “but Grimm did not know me.”",
        "I was told that Tieck was ill–could see no one; I therefore only sent\nin my card. Some days afterwards I met at a friend’s house, where\nRauch’s birth-day was being celebrated, Tieck, the sculptor, who told\nme that his brother had lately waited two hours for me at dinner. I\nwent to him and discovered that he had sent me an invitation, which,\nhowever, had been taken to a wrong inn. A fresh invitation was given,\nand I passed some delightfully cheerful hours with Raumer the\nhistorian, and with the widow and daughter of Steffens. There is a\nmusic in Tieck’s voice, a spirituality in his intelligent eyes, which\nage cannot lessen, but, on the contrary, must increase. The Elves,\nperhaps the most beautiful story which has been conceived in our time,\nwould alone be sufficient, had Tieck written nothing else, to make his\nname immortal. As the author of M rchen, I bow myself before\nhim, the elder and The master, and who was the first German poet, who\nmany years before pressed me to his breast, as if it were to consecrate\nme, to walk in the same path with himself.",
        "The old friends had all to be visited; but the number of new ones grew\nwith each day. One invitation followed another. It required\nconsiderable physical power to support so much good-will. I remained in\nBerlin about three weeks, and the time seemed to pass more rapidly with\neach succeeding day. I was, as it were, overcome by kindness. I, at\nlength, had no other prospect for repose than to seat myself in a\nrailway-carriage, and fly away out of the country.",
        "And yet amid these social festivities, with all the amiable zeal and\ninterest that then was felt for me, I had one disengaged evening; one\nevening on which I suddenly felt solitude in its most oppressive form;\nChristmas-eve, that very evening of all others on which I would most\nwillingly witness something festal, willingly stand beside a Christmas-\ntree, gladdening myself with the joy of children, and seeing the\nparents joyfully become children again. Every one of the many families\nin which I in truth felt that I was received as a relation, had\nfancied, as I afterwards discovered, that I must be invited out; but I\nsat quite alone in my room at the inn, and thought on home. I seated\nmyself at the open window, and gazed up to the starry heavens, which\nwas the Christmas-tree that was lighted for me.",
        "“Father in Heaven,” I prayed, as the children do, “what dost thou give\nto me!”",
        "When the friends heard of my solitary Christmas night, there were on\nthe following evening many Christmas-trees lighted, and on the last\nevening in the year, there was planted for me alone, a little tree with\nits lights, and its beautiful presents–and that was by Jenny Lind. The\nwhole company consisted of herself, her attendant, and me; we three\nchildren from the north were together on Sylvester-eve, and I was the\nchild for which the Christmas-tree was lighted. She rejoiced with the\nfeeling of a sister in my good fortune in Berlin; and I felt almost\npride in the sympathy of such a pure, noble, and womanly being.\nEverywhere her praise resounded, not merely as a singer, but also as a\nwoman; the two combined awoke a real enthusiasm for her.",
        "It does one good both in mind and heart to see that which is glorious\nunderstood and beloved. In one little anecdote contributing to her\ntriumph I was myself made the confidant.",
        "One morning as I looked out of my window unter den Linden, I saw\na man under one of the trees, half hidden, and shabbily dressed, who\ntook a comb out of his pocket, smoothed his hair, set his neckerchief\nstraight, and brushed his coat with his hand; I understood that bashful\npoverty which feels depressed by its shabby dress. A moment after this,\nthere was a knock at my door, and this same man entered. It was W––,\nthe poet of nature, who is only a poor tailor, but who has a truly\npoetical mind. Rellstab and others in Berlin have mentioned him with\nhonor; there is something healthy in his poems, among which several of\na sincerely religious character may be found. He had read that I was in\nBerlin, and wished now to visit me. We sat together on the sofa and\nconversed: there was such an amiable contentedness, such an unspoiled\nand good tone of mind about him, that I was sorry not to be rich in\norder that I might do something for him. I was ashamed of offering him\nthe little that I could give; in any case I wished to put it in as\nagreeable a form as I could. I asked him whether I might invite him to\nhear Jenny Lind.",
        "“I have already heard her,” said he smiling; “I had, it is true, no\nmoney to buy a ticket; but I went to the leader of the supernumeraries,\nand asked whether I might not act as a supernumerary for one evening in\nNorma: I was accepted and habited as a Roman soldier, with a long sword\nby my side, and thus got to the theatre, where I could hear her better\nthan any body else, for I stood close to her. Ah, how she sung, how she\nplayed! I could not help crying; but they were angry at that: the\nleader forbade and would not let me again make my appearance, because\nno one must weep on the stage.”",
        "With the exception of the theatre, I had very little time to visit\ncollections of any kind or institutions of art. The able and amiable\nOlfers, however, the Director of the Museum, enabled me to pay a rapid\nbut extremely interesting visit to that institution. Olfers himself was\nmy conductor; we delayed our steps only for the most interesting\nobjects, and there are here not a few of these; his remarks threw light\nupon my mind,–for this therefore I am infinitely obliged to him.",
        "I had the happiness of visiting the Princess of Prussia many times; the\nwing of the castle in which she resided was so comfortable, and yet\nlike a fairy palace. The blooming winter-garden, where the fountain\nsplashed among the moss at the foot of the statue, was close beside the\nroom in which the kind-hearted children smiled with their soft blue\neyes. On taking leave she honored me with a richly bound album, in\nwhich, beneath the picture of the palace, she wrote her name. I shall\nguard this volume as a treasure of the soul; it is not the gift which\nhas a value only, but also the manner in which it is given. One\nforenoon I read to her several of my little stories, and her noble\nhusband listened kindly: Prince P ckler-Muskau also was present.",
        "A few days after my arrival in Berlin, I had the honor to be invited to\nthe royal table. As I was better acquainted with Humboldt than any one\nthere, and he it was who had particularly interested himself about me,\nI took my place at his side. Not only on account of his high\nintellectual character, and his amiable and polite behavior, but also\nfrom his infinite kindness towards me, during the whole of my residence\nin Berlin, is he become unchangeably dear to me.",
        "The King received me most graciously, and said that during his stay in\nCopenhagen he had inquired after me, and had heard that I was\ntravelling. He expressed a great interest in my novel of Only a\nFiddler; her Majesty the Queen also showed herself graciously and\nkindly disposed towards me. I had afterwards the happiness of being\ninvited to spend an evening at the palace at Potsdam; an evening which\nis full of rich remembrance and never to be forgotten! Besides the\nladies and gentlemen in waiting, Humboldt and myself were only invited.\nA seat was assigned to me at the table of their Majesties, exactly the\nplace, said the Queen, where Oehlenschl ger had sat and read his\ntragedy of Dina. I read four little stories, the Fir-Tree, the Ugly\nDuckling, the Ball and the Top, and The Swineherd. The King listened\nwith great interest, and expressed himself most wittily on the subject.\nHe said, how beautiful he thought the natural scenery of Denmark, and\nhow excellently he had seen one of Holberg’s comedies performed.",
        "It was so deliciously pleasant in the royal apartment,–gentle eyes\nwere gazing at me, and I felt that they all wished me well. When at\nnight I was alone in my chamber, my thoughts were so occupied with this\nevening, and my mind in such a state of excitement, that I could not\nsleep. Everything seemed to me like a fairy tale. Through the whole\nnight the chimes sounded in the tower, and the aerial music mingled\nitself with my thoughts.",
        "I received still one more proof of the favor and kindness of the King\nof Prussia towards me, on the evening before my departure from the\ncity. The order of the Red Eagle, of the third class, was conferred\nupon me. Such a mark of honor delights certainly every one who receives\nit. I confess candidly that I felt myself honored in a high degree. I\ndiscerned in it an evident token of the kindness of the noble,\nenlightened King towards me: my heart is filled with gratitude. I\nreceived this mark of honor exactly on the birth-day of my benefactor\nCollin, the 6th of January; this day has now a twofold festal\nsignificance for me. May God fill with gladness the mind of the royal\ndonor who wished to give me pleasure!",
        "The last evening was spent in a warm-hearted circle, for the greater\npart, of young people. My health was drunk; a poem, Der M rchenk÷nig,\ndeclaimed. It was not until late in the night that I reached home, that\nI might set off early in the morning by railroad.",
        "I have here given in part a proof of the favor and kindness which was\nshown to me in Berlin: I feel like some one who has received a\nconsiderable sum for a certain object from a large assembly, and now\nwould give an account thereof. I might still add many other names, as\nwell from the learned world, as Theodor, M gge, Geibel, H ring, etc.,\nas from the social circle;–the reckoning is too large. God give me\nstrength for that which I now have to perform, after I have, as an\nearnest of good will, received such a richly abundant sum.",
        "After a journey of a day and night I was once more in Weimar, with my\nnoble Hereditary Grand Duke. What a cordial reception! A heart rich in\ngoodness, and a mind full of noble endeavors, live in this young\nprince. I have no words for the infinite favor, which, during my\nresidence here, I received daily from the family of the Grand Duke, but\nmy whole heart is full of devotion. At the court festival, as well as\nin the familiar family circle, I had many evidences of the esteem in\nwhich I was held. Beaulieu cared for me with the tenderness of a\nbrother. It was to me a month-long Sabbath festival. Never shall I\nforget the quiet evenings spent with him, when friend spoke freely to\nfriend.",
        "My old friends were also unchanged; the wise and able Sch÷ll, as well\nas Schober, joined them also. Jenny Lind came to Weimar; I heard her at\nthe court concerts and at the theatre; I visited with her the places\nwhich are become sacred through Goethe and Schiller: we stood together\nbeside their coffins, where Chancellor von M ller led us. The Austrian\npoet, Rollet, who met us here for the first time, wrote on this subject\na sweet poem, which will serve me as a visible remembrance of this hour\nand this place. People lay lovely flowers in their books, and as such,\nI lay in here this verse of his:–",
        "Weimar, 29th January, 1846.",
        "  M rchen rose, which has so often\n    Charmed me with thy fragrant breath;\n  Where the prince, the poets slumber,\n    Thou hast wreathed the hall of death.",
        "  And with thee beside each coffin,\n    In the death-hushed chamber pale,\n  I beheld a grief-enchanted,\n    Sweetly dreaming nightingale.",
        "  I rejoiced amid the stillness;\n    Gladness through my bosom past,\n  That the gloomy poets’ coffins\n    Such a magic crowned at last.",
        "  And thy rose’s summer fragrance\n    Floated round that chamber pale,\n  With the gentle melancholy\n    Of the grief-hushed nightingale.",
        "It was in the evening circle of the intellectual Froriep that I met,\nfor the first time, with Auerbach, who then chanced to be staying in\nWeimar. His “Village Tales” interested me in the highest degree; I\nregard them as the most poetical, most healthy, and joyous production\nof the young German literature. He himself made the same agreeable\nimpression upon me; there is something so frank and straightforward,\nand yet so sagacious, in his whole appearance, I might almost say, that\nhe looks himself like a village tale, healthy to the core, body and\nsoul, and his eyes beaming with honesty. We soon became friends–and I\nhope forever.",
        "My stay in Weimar was prolonged; it became ever more difficult to tear\nmyself away. The Grand Duke’s birth-day occurred at this time, and\nafter attending all the festivities to which I was invited, I departed.\nI would and must be in Rome at Easter. Once more in the early morning,\nI saw the Hereditary Grand Duke, and, with a heart full of emotion,\nbade him farewell. Never, in presence of the world, will I forget the\nhigh position which his birth gives him, but I may say, as the very\npoorest subject may say of a prince, I love him as one who is dearest\nto my heart. God give him joy and bless him in his noble endeavors! A\ngenerous heart beats beneath the princely star.",
        "Beaulieu accompanied me to Jena. Here a hospitable home awaited me, and\nfilled with beautiful memories from the time of Goethe, the house of\nthe publisher Frommann. It was his kind, warm-hearted sister, who had\nshown me such sympathy in Berlin; the brother was not here less kind.",
        "The Holstener Michelsen, who has a professorship at Jena, assembled a\nnumber of friends one evening, and in a graceful and cordial toast for\nme, expressed his sense of the importance of Danish literature, and the\nhealthy and natural spirit which flourished in it.",
        "In Michelsen’s house I also became acquainted with Professor Hase, who,\none evening having heard some of my little stories, seemed filled with\ngreat kindness towards me. What he wrote in this moment of interest on\nan album leaf expresses this sentiment:",
        "“Schelling–not he who now lives in Berlin, but he who lives an\nimmortal hero in the world of mind–once said: ’Nature is the visible\nspirit.’ This spirit, this unseen nature, last evening was again\nrendered visible to me through your little tales. If on the one hand\nyou penetrate deeply into the mysteries of nature; know and understand\nthe language of birds, and what are the feelings of a fir-tree or a\ndaisy, so that each seems to be there on its own account, and we and\nour children sympathize with them in their joys and sorrows; yet, on\nthe other hand, all is but the image of mind; and the human heart in\nits infinity, trembles and throbs throughout. May this fountain in the\npoet’s heart, which God has lent you, still for a time pour forth this\nrefreshingly, and may these stories in the memories of the Germanic\nnations, become the legends of the people!” That object, for which as a\nwriter of poetical fictions, I must strive after, is contained in these\nlast lines.",
        "It is also to Hase and the gifted improvisatore, Professor Wolff of\nJena, to whom I am most indebted for the appearance of a uniform German\nedition of my writings.",
        "This was all arranged on my arrival at Leipzig: several hours of\nbusiness were added to my traveller’s mode of life. The city of\nbookselling presented me with her bouquet, a sum of money; but she\npresented me with even more. I met again with Brockhaus, and passed\nhappy hours with Mendelssohn, that glorious man of genius. I heard him\nplay again and again; it seemed to me that his eyes, full of soul,\nlooked into the very depths of my being. Few men have more the stamp of\nthe inward fire than he. A gentle, friendly wife, and beautiful\nchildren, make his rich, well-appointed house, blessed and pleasant.\nWhen he rallied me about the Stork, and its frequent appearance in my\nwritings, there was something so childlike and amiable revealed in this\ngreat artist!",
        "I also met again my excellent countryman Gade, whose compositions have\nbeen so well received in Germany. I took him the text for a new opera\nwhich I had written, and which I hope to see brought out on the German\nstage. Gade had written the music to my drama of Agnete and the Merman,\ncompositions which were very successful. Auerbach, whom I again found\nhere, introduced me to many agreeable circles. I met with the composer\nKalliwoda, and with K hne, whose charming little son immediately won my\nheart.",
        "On my arrival at Dresden I instantly hastened to my motherly friend,\nthe Baroness von Decken. That was a joyous hearty welcome! One equally\ncordial I met with from Dahl. I saw once more my Roman friend, the poet\nwith word and color, Reineck, and met the kind-hearted Bendemann.\nProfessor Grahl painted me. I missed, however, one among my olden\nfriends, the poet Brunnow. With life and cordiality he received me the\nlast time in his room, where stood lovely flowers; now these grew over\nhis grave. It awakens a peculiar feeling, thus for once to meet on the\njourney of life, to understand and love each other, and then to part–\nuntil the journey for both is ended.",
        "I spent, to me, a highly interesting evening, with the royal family,\nwho received me with extraordinary favor. Here also the most happy\ndomestic life appeared to reign–a number of amiable children, all\nbelonging to Prince Johann, were present. The least of the Princesses,\na little girl, who knew that I had written the history of the Fir-tree,\nbegan very confidentially with–\"Last Christmas we also had a Fir-tree,\nand it stood here in this room!” Afterwards, when she was led out\nbefore the other children, and had bade her parents and the King and\nQueen good night, she turned round at the half-closed door, and nodding\nto me in a friendly and familiar manner, said I was her Fairy-tale\nPrince.",
        "My story of Holger Danske led the conversation to the rich stores of\nlegends which the north possesses. I related several, and explained the\npeculiar spirit of the fine scenery of Denmark. Neither in this royal\npalace did I feel the weight of ceremony; soft, gentle eyes shone upon\nme. My last morning in Dresden was spent with the Minister von\nK÷nneritz, where I equally met with the most friendly reception.",
        "The sun shone warm: it was spring who was celebrating her arrival, as I\nrolled out of the dear city. Thought assembled in one amount all the\nmany who had rendered my visits so rich and happy: it was spring around\nme, and spring in my heart.",
        "In Prague I had only one acquaintance, Professor Wiesenfeldt. But a\nletter from Dr. Carus in Dresden opened to me the hospitable house of\nCount Thun. The Archduke Stephan received me also in the most gracious\nmanner; I found in him a young man full of intellect and heart. Besides\nit was a very interesting point of time when I left Prague. The\nmilitary, who had been stationed there a number of years, were\nhastening to the railway, to leave for Poland, where disturbances had\nbroken out. The whole city seemed in movement to take leave of its\nmilitary friends; it was difficult to get through the streets which led\nto the railway. Many thousand soldiers were to be accommodated; at\nlength the train was set in motion. All around the whole hill-side was\ncovered with people; it looked like the richest Turkey carpet woven of\nmen, women and children, all pressed together, head to head, and waving\nhats and handkerchiefs. Such a mass of human beings I never saw before,\nor at least, never at one moment surveyed them: such a spectacle could\nnot be painted.",
        "We travelled the whole night through wide Bohemia: at every town stood\ngroups of people; it was as though all the inhabitants had assembled\nthemselves. Their brown faces, their ragged clothes, the light of their\ntorches, their, to me, unintelligible language, gave to the whole a\nstamp of singularity. We flew through tunnel and over viaduct; the\nwindows rattled, the signal whistle sounded, the steam horses snorted–\nI laid back my head at last in the carriage, and fell asleep under the\nprotection of the god Morpheus.",
        "At Olm tz, where we had fresh carnages, a voice spoke my name–it was\nWalter Goethe! We had travelled together the whole night without\nknowing it. In Vienna we met often. Noble powers, true genius, live in\nGoethe’s grandsons, in the composer as well as in the poet; but it is\nas if the greatness of their grandfather pressed upon them. Liszt was\nin Vienna, and invited me to his concert, in which otherwise it would\nhave been impossible to find a place. I again heard his improvising of\nRobert! I again heard him, like a spirit of the storm, play with the\nchords: he is an enchanter of sounds who fills the imagination with\nastonishment. Ernst also was here; when I visited him he seized the\nviolin, and this sang in tears the secret of a human heart.",
        "I saw the amiable Grillparzer again, and was frequently with the kindly\nCastelli, who just at this time had been made by the King of Denmark\nKnight of the Danebrog Order. He was full of joy at this, and begged me\nto tell my countrymen that every Dane should receive a hearty welcome\nfrom him. Some future summer he invited me to visit his grand country\nseat. There is something in Castelli so open and honorable, mingled\nwith such good-natured humor, that one must like him: he appears to me\nthe picture of a thorough Viennese. Under his portrait, which he gave\nme, he wrote the following little improvised verse in the style so\npeculiarly his own:",
        "  This portrait shall ever with loving eyes greet thee,\n    From far shall recall the smile of thy friend;\n  For thou, dearest Dane, ’tis a pleasure to meet thee,\n    Thou art one to be loved and esteemed to the end.",
        "Castelli introduced me to Seidl and Bauernfeld. At the Danisti\nambassador’s, Baron von L÷wenstern, I met Zedlitz. Most of the shining\nstars of Austrian literature I saw glide past me, as people on a\nrailway see church towers; you can still say you have seen them; and\nstill retaining the simile of the stars, I can say, that in the\nConcordia Society I saw the entire galaxy. Here was a host of young\ngrowing intellects, and here were men of importance. At the house of\nCount Szechenye, who hospitably invited me, I saw his brother from\nPest, whose noble activity in Hungary is known. This short meeting I\naccount one of the most interesting events of my stay in Vienna; the\nman revealed himself in all his individuality, and his eye said that\nyou must feel confidence in him.",
        "At my departure from Dresden her Majesty the Queen of Saxony had asked\nme whether I had introductions to any one at the Court of Vienna, and\nwhen I told her that I had not, the Queen was so gracious as to write a\nletter to her sister, the Archduchess Sophia of Austria. Her imperial\nHighness summoned me one evening, and received me in the most gracious\nmanner. The dowager Empress, the widow of the Emperor Francis I., was\npresent, and full of kindness and friendship towards me; also Prince\nWasa, and the hereditary Archduchess of Hesse-Darmstadt. The\nremembrance of this evening will always remain dear and interesting to\nme. I read several of my little stories aloud–when I wrote them, I\nthought least of all that I should some day read them aloud in the\nimperial palace.",
        "Before my departure I had still another visit to make, and this was to\nthe intellectual authoress, Frau von Weissenthurn. She had just left a\nbed of sickness and was still suffering, but wished to see me. As\nthough she were already standing on the threshold of the realm of\nshades, she pressed my hand and said this was the last time we should\never see each other. With a soft motherly gaze she looked at me, and at\nparting her penetrating eye followed me to the door.",
        "With railway and diligence my route now led towards Triest. With steam\nthe long train of carriages flies along the narrow rocky way, following\nall the windings of the river. One wonders that with all these abrupt\nturnings one is not dashed against the rock, or flung down into the\nroaring stream, and is glad when the journey is happily accomplished.\nBut in the slow diligence one wishes its more rapid journey might\nrecommence, and praise the powers of the age.",
        "At length Triest and the Adriatic sea lay before us; the Italian\nlanguage sounded in our ears, but yet for me it was not Italy, the land\nof my desire. Meanwhile I was only a stranger here for a few hours; our\nDanish consul, as well as the consuls of Prussia and Oldenburg, to whom\nI was recommended, received me in the best possible manner. Several\ninteresting acquaintances were made, especially with the Counts\nO’Donnell and Waldstein, the latter for me as a Dane having a peculiar\ninterest, as being the descendant of that unfortunate Confitz Ulfeld\nand the daughter of Christian IV., Eleanore, the noblest of all Danish\nwomen. Their portraits hung in his room, and Danish memorials of that\nperiod were shown me. It was the first time I had ever seen Eleanore\nUlfeld’s portrait, and the melancholy smile on her lips seemed to say,\n\"Poet, sing and free from chains which a hard age had cast upon him,\nfor whom to live and to suffer was my happiness!” Before Oehlenschl ger\nwrote his Dina, which treats of an episode in Ulfeld’s life, I was at\nwork on this subject, and wished to bring it on the stage, but it was\nthen feared this would not be allowed, and I gave it up–since then I\nhave only written four lines on Ulfeld:–",
        "  Thy virtue was concealed, not so thy failings,\n  Thus did the world thy greatness never know,\n  Yet still love’s glorious monument proclaims it,\n  That the best wife from thee would never go.",
        "On the Adriatic sea I, in thought, was carried back to Ulfeld’s time\nand the Danish islands. This meeting with Count Waldstein and his\nancestor’s portrait brought me back to my poet’s world, and I almost\nforgot that the following day I could be in the middle of Italy. In\nbeautiful mild weather I went with the steam-boat to Ancona.",
        "It was a quiet starlight night, too beautiful to be spent in sleep. In\nthe early morning the coast of Italy lay before us, the beautiful blue\nmountains with glittering snow. The sun shone warmly, the grass and the\ntrees were so splendidly green. Last evening in Trieste, now in Ancona,\nin a city of the papal states,–that was almost like enchantment! Italy\nin all its picturesque splendor lay once more before me; spring had\nripened all the fruit trees so that they had burst forth into blossom;\nevery blade of grass in the field was filled with sunshine, the elm\ntrees stood like caryatides enwreathed with vines, which shot forth\ngreen leaves, and above the luxuriance of foliage rose the wavelike\nblue mountains with their snow covering. In company with Count Paar\nfrom Vienna, the most excellent travelling companion, and a young\nnobleman from Hungary, I now travelled on with a vetturino for five\ndays: solitary, and more picturesque than habitable inns among the\nApennines were our night’s quarters. At length the Campagna, with its\nthought-awakening desolation, lay before us.",
        "It was the 31st of March, 1846, when I again saw Rome, and for the\nthird time in my life should reach this city of the world. I felt so\nhappy, so penetrated with thankfulness and joy; how much more God had\ngiven me than a thousand others–nay, than to many thousands! And even\nin this very feeling there is a blessing–where joy is very great, as\nin the deepest grief, there is only God on whom one can lean! The first\nimpression was–I can find no other word for it–adoration. When day\nunrolled for me my beloved Rome, I felt what I cannot express more\nbriefly or better than I did in a letter to a friend: “I am growing\nhere into the very ruins, I live with the petrified gods, and the roses\nare always blooming, and the church bells ringing–and yet Rome is not\nthe Rome it was thirteen years ago when I first was here. It is as if\neverything were modernized, the ruins even, grass and bushes are\ncleared away. Everything is made so neat; the very life of the people\nseems to have retired; I no longer hear the tamborines in the streets,\nno longer see the young girls dancing their Saltarella, even in the\nCampagna intelligence has entered by invisible railroads; the peasant\nno longer believes as he used to do. At the Easter festival I saw great\nnumbers of the people from the Campagna standing before St. Peters\nwhilst the Pope distributed his blessing, just as though they had been\nProtestant strangers. This was repulsive to my feelings, I felt an\nimpulse to kneel before the invisible saint. When I was here thirteen\nyears ago, all knelt; now reason had conquered faith. Ten years later,\nwhen the railways will have brought cities still nearer to each other,\nRome will be yet more changed. But in all that happens, everything is\nfor the best; one always must love Rome; it is like a story book, one\nis always discovering new wonders, and one lives in imagination and\nreality.”",
        "The first time I travelled to Italy I had no eyes for sculpture; in\nParis the rich pictures drew me away from the statues; for the first\ntime when I came to Florence and stood before the Venus de Medicis, I\nfelt as Thorwaldsen expressed, “the snow melted away from my eyes;” and\na new world of art rose before me. And now at my third sojourn in Rome,\nafter repeated wanderings through the Vatican, I prize the statues far\nhigher than the paintings. But at what other places as at Rome, and to\nsome degree in Naples, does this art step forth so grandly into life!\nOne is carried away by it, one learns to admire nature in the work of\nart, the beauty of form becomes spiritual.",
        "Among the many clever and beautiful things which I saw exhibited in the\nstudios of the young artists, two pieces of sculpture were what most\ndeeply impressed themselves on my memory; and these were in the studio\nof my countryman Jerichau. I saw his group of Hercules and Hebe, which\nhad been spoken of with such enthusiasm in the Allgemeine Zeitung and\nother German papers, and which, through its antique repose, and its\nglorious beauty, powerfully seized upon me. My imagination was filled\nby it, and yet I must place Jerichau’s later group, the Fighting\nHunter, still higher. It is formed after the model, as though it had\nsprung from nature. There lies in it a truth, a beauty, and a grandeur\nwhich I am convinced will make his name resound through many lands!",
        "I have known him from the time when he was almost a boy. We were both\nof us born on the same island: he is from the little town of Assens. We\nmet in Copenhagen. No one, not even he himself, knew what lay within\nhim; and half in jest, half in earnest, he spoke of the combat with\nhimself whether he should go to America and become a savage, or to Rome\nand become an artist–painter or sculptor; that he did not yet know.\nHis pencil was meanwhile thrown away: he modelled in clay, and my bust\nwas the first which he made. He received no travelling stipendium from\nthe Academy. As far as I know, it was a noble-minded woman, an artist\nherself, unprovided with means, who, from the interest she felt for the\nspark of genius she observed in him, assisted him so far that he\nreached Italy by means of a trading vessel. In the beginning he worked\nin Thorwaldsen’s atelier. During a journey of several years, he has\ndoubtless experienced the struggles of genius and the galling fetters\nof want; but now the star of fortune shines upon him. When I came to\nRome, I found him physically suffering and melancholy. He was unable to\nbear the warm summers of Italy; and many people said he could not\nrecover unless he visited the north, breathed the cooler air, and took\nsea-baths. His praises resounded through the papers, glorious works\nstood in his atelier; but man does not live on heavenly bread alone.\nThere came one day a Russian Prince, I believe, and he gave a\ncommission for the Hunter. Two other commissions followed on the same\nday. Jerichau came full of rejoicing and told this to me. A few days\nafter he travelled with his wife, a highly gifted painter, to Denmark,\nfrom whence, strengthened body and soul, he returned, with the winter,\nto Rome, where the strokes of his chisel will resound so that, I hope,\nthe world will hear them. My heart will beat joyfully with them!",
        "I also met in Rome, Kolberg, another Danish sculptor, until now only\nknown in Denmark, but there very highly thought of, a scholar of\nThorwaldsen’s and a favorite of that great master. He honored me by\nmaking my bust. I also sat once more with the kindly K chler, and saw\nthe forms fresh as nature spread themselves over the canvas.",
        "I sat once again with the Roman people in the amusing puppet theatre,\nand heard the children’s merriment. Among the German artists, as well\nas among the Swedes and my own countrymen, I met with a hearty\nreception. My birth-day was joyfully celebrated. Frau von Goethe, who\nwas in Rome, and who chanced to be living in the very house where I\nbrought my Improvisatore into the world, and made him spend his first\nyears of childhood, sent me from thence a large, true Roman bouquet, a\nfragrant mosaic. The Swedish painter, S÷dermark, proposed my health to\nthe company whom the Danes, Swedes, and Norwegians had invited me to\nmeet. From my friends I received some pretty pictures and friendly\nkeepsakes.",
        "The Hanoverian minister, K stner, to whose friendship I am indebted for\nmany pleasant hours, is an extremely agreeable man, possessed of no\nsmall talent for poetry, music, and painting. At his house I really saw\nfor the first time flower-painting elevated by a poetical idea. In one\nof his rooms he has introduced an arabesque of flowers which presents\nus with the flora of the whole year. It commences with the first spring\nflowers, the crocus, the snow drop, and so on; then come the summer\nflowers, then the autumn, and at length the garland ends with the red\nberries and yellow-brown leaves of December.",
        "Constantly in motion, always striving to employ every moment and to see\neverything, I felt myself at last very much affected by the unceasing\nsirocco. The Roman air did not agree with me, and I hastened,\ntherefore, as soon as I had seen the illumination of the dome and the\ngirandola, immediately after the Easter festival, through\nTerracina to Naples. Count Paar travelled with me. We entered St.\nLucia: the sea lay before us; Vesuvius blazed. Those were glorious\nevenings! moonlight nights! It was as if the heavens had elevated\nthemselves above and the stars were withdrawn. What effect of light! In\nthe north the moon scatters silver over the water: here it was gold.\nThe circulating lanterns of the lighthouse now exhibited their dazzling\nlight, now were totally extinguished. The torches of the fishing-boats\nthrew their obelisk-formed blaze along the surface of the water, or\nelse the boat concealed them like a black shadow, below which the\nsurface of the water was illuminated. One fancied one could see to the\nbottom, where fishes and plants were in motion. Along the street itself\nthousands of lights were burning in the shops of the dealers in fruit\nand fish. Now came a troop of children with lights, and went in\nprocession to the church of St. Lucia. Many fell down with their\nlights; but above the whole stood, like the hero of this great drama of\nlight, Vesuvius with his blood-red flame and his illumined cloud of\nsmoke.",
        "I visited the islands of Capri and Ischia once more; and, as the heat\nof the sun and the strong sirocco made a longer residence in Naples\noppressive to me, I went to Sarrento, Tasso’s city, where the foliage\nof the vine cast a shade, and where the air appears to me lighter. Here\nI wrote these pages. In Rome, by the bay of Naples and amid the\nPyrenees, I put on paper the story of my life.",
        "The well-known festival of the Madonna dell’ Arco called me again to\nNaples, where I took up my quarters at an hotel in the middle of the\ncity, near the Toledo Street, and found an excellent host and hostess.\nI had already resided here, but only in the winter. I had now to see\nNaples in its summer heat and with all its wild tumult, but in what\ndegree I had never imagined. The sun shone down with its burning heat\ninto the narrow streets, in at the balcony door. It was necessary to\nshut up every place: not a breath of air stirred. Every little corner,\nevery spot in the street on which a shadow fell was crowded with\nworking handicraftsmen, who chattered loudly and merrily; the carriages\nrolled past; the drivers screamed; the tumult of the people roared like\na sea in the other streets; the church bells sounded every minute; my\nopposite neighbor, God knows who he was, played the musical scale from\nmorning till evening. It was enough to make one lose one’s senses!",
        "The sirocco blew its boiling-hot breath and I was perfectly overcome.\nThere was not another room to be had at St. Lucia, and the sea-bathing\nseemed rather to weaken than to invigorate me. I went therefore again\ninto the country; but the sun burned there with the same beams; yet\nstill the air there was more elastic, yet for all that it was to me\nlike the poisoned mantle of Hercules, which, as it were, drew out of me\nstrength and spirit. I, who had fancied that I must be precisely a\nchild of the sun, so firmly did my heart always cling to the south, was\nforced to acknowledge that the snow of the north was in my body, that\nthe snow melted, and that I was more and more miserable.",
        "Most strangers felt as I myself did in this, as the Neapolitans\nthemselves said, unusually hot summer; the greater number went away. I\nalso would have done the same, but I was obliged to wait several days\nfor a letter of credit; it had arrived at the right time, but lay\nforgotten in the hands of my banker. Yet there was a deal for me to see\nin Naples; many houses were open to me. I tried whether the will were\nnot stronger than the Neapolitan heat, but I fell into such a nervous\nstate in consequence, that till the time of my departure I was obliged\nto lie quietly in my hot room, where the night brought no coolness.\nFrom the morning twilight to midnight roared the noise of bells, the\ncry of the people, the trampling of horses on the stone pavement, and\nthe before-mentioned practiser of the scale–it was like being on the\nrack; and this caused me to give up my journey to Spain, especially as\nI was assured, for my consolation, that I should find it just as warm\nthere as here. The physician said that, at this season of the year, I\ncould not sustain the journey.",
        "I took a berth in the steam-boat Castor for Marseilles; the vessel was\nfull to overflowing with passengers; the whole quarter-deck, even the\nbest place, was occupied by travelling carriages; under one of these I\nhad my bed laid; many people followed my example, and the quarter-deck\nwas soon covered with mattresses and carpets. It blew strongly; the\nwind increased, and in the second and third night raged to a perfect\nstorm; the ship rolled from side to side like a cask in the open sea;\nthe waves dashed on the ship’s side and lifted up their broad heads\nabove the bulwarks as if they would look in upon us. It was as if the\ncarriages under which we lay would crush us to pieces, or else would be\nwashed away by the sea. There was a lamentation, but I lay quiet,\nlooked up at the driving clouds, and thought upon God and my beloved.\nWhen at length we reached Genoa most of the passengers went on land: I\nshould have been willing enough to have followed their example, that I\nmight go by Milan to Switzerland, but my letter of credit was drawn\nupon Marseilles and some Spanish sea-ports. I was obliged to go again\non board. The sea was calm; the air fresh; it was the most glorious\nvoyage along the charming Sardinian coast. Full of strength and new\nlife I arrived at Marseilles, and, as I here breathed more easily, my\nlonging to see Spain was again renewed. I had laid the plan of seeing\nthis country last, as the bouquet of my journey. In the suffering state\nin which I had been I was obliged to give it up, but I was now better.\nI regarded it therefore as a pointing of the finger of heaven that I\nshould be compelled to go to Marseilles, and determined to venture upon\nthe journey. The steam-vessel to Barcelona had, in the meantime, just\nsailed, and several days must pass before another set out. I determined\ntherefore to travel by short days’ journeys through the south of France\nacross the Pyrenees.",
        "Before leaving Marseilles, chance favored me with a short meeting with\none of my friends from the North, and this was Ole Bull! He came from\nAmerica, and was received in France with jubilees and serenades, of\nwhich I was myself a witness. At the table d’h te in the\nH tel des Empereurs, where we both lodged, we flew towards each\nother. He told me what I should have expected least of all, that my\nworks had also many friends in America, that people had inquired from\nhim about me with the greatest interest, and that the English\ntranslations of my romances had been reprinted, and spread through the\nwhole country in cheap editions. My name flown over the great ocean! I\nfelt myself at this thought quite insignificant, but yet glad and\nhappy; wherefore should I, in preference to so many thousand others,\nreceive such happiness?",
        "I had and still have a feeling as though I were a poor peasant lad over\nwhom a royal mantle is thrown. Yet I was and am made happy by all this!\nIs this vanity, or does it show itself in these expressions of\nmy joy?",
        "Ole Bull went to Algiers, I towards the Pyrenees. Through Provence,\nwhich looked to me quite Danish, I reached Nismes, where the grandeur\nof the splendid Roman amphitheatre at once carried me back to Italy.\nThe memorials of antiquity in the south of France I have never heard\npraised as their greatness and number deserve; the so-called Maison\nQuar e is still standing in all its splendor, like the Theseus\nTemple at Athens: Rome has nothing so well preserved.",
        "In Nismes dwells the baker Reboul, who writes the most charming poems:\nwhoever may not chance to know him from these is, however, well\nacquainted with him through Lamartine’s Journey to the East. I found\nhim at the house, stepped into the bakehouse, and addressed myself to a\nman in shirt sleeves who was putting bread into the oven; it was Reboul\nhimself! A noble countenance which expressed a manly character greeted\nme. When I mentioned my name, he was courteous enough to say he was\nacquainted with it through the Revue de Paris, and begged me to visit\nhim in the afternoon, when he should be able to entertain me better.\nWhen I came again I found him in a little room which might be called\nalmost elegant, adorned with pictures, casts and books, not alone\nFrench literature, but translations of the Greek classics. A picture on\nthe wall represented his most celebrated poem, “The Dying Child,” from\nMarmier’s Chansons du Nord. He knew I had treated the same\nsubject, and I told him that this was written in my school days. If in\nthe morning I had found him the industrious baker, he now was the poet\ncompletely; he spoke with animation of the literature of his country,\nand expressed a wish to see the north, the scenery and intellectual\nlife of which seemed to interest him. With great respect I took leave\nof a man whom the Muses have not meanly endowed, and who yet has good\nsense enough, spite of all the homage paid him, to remain steadfast to\nhis honest business, and prefer being the most remarkable baker of\nNismes to losing himself in Paris, after a short triumph, among\nhundreds of other poets.",
        "By railway I now travelled by way of Montpelier to Cette, with that\nrapidity which a train possesses in France; you fly there as though for\na wager with the wild huntsman. I involuntarily remembered that at\nBasle, at the corner of a street where formerly the celebrated Dance of\nDeath was painted, there is written up in large letters “Dance of\nDeath,” and on the opposite corner “Way to the Railroad.” This singular\njuxtaposition just at the frontiers of France, gives play to the fancy;\nin this rushing flight it came into my thoughts; it seemed as though\nthe steam whistle gave the signal to the dance. On German railways one\ndoes not have such wild fancies.",
        "The islander loves the sea as the mountaineer loves his mountains!",
        "Every sea-port town, however small it may be, receives in my eyes a\npeculiar charm from the sea. Was it the sea, in connexion perhaps with\nthe Danish tongue, which sounded in my ears in two houses in Cette,\nthat made this town so homelike to me? I know not, but I felt more in\nDenmark than in the south of France. When far from your country you\nenter a house where all, from the master and mistress to the servants,\nspeak your own language, as was here the case, these home tones have a\nreal power of enchantment: like the mantle of Faust, in a moment they\ntransport you, house and all, into your own land. Here, however, there\nwas no northern summer, but the hot sun of Naples; it might even have\nburnt Faust’s cap. The sun’s rays destroyed all strength. For many\nyears there had not been such a summer, even here; and from the country\nround about arrived accounts of people who had died from the heat: the\nvery nights were hot. I was told beforehand I should be unable to bear\nthe journey in Spain. I felt this myself, but then Spain was to be the\nbouquet of my journey. I already saw the Pyrenees; the blue mountains\nenticed me–and one morning early I found myself on the steam-boat. The\nsun rose higher; it burnt above, it burnt from the expanse of waters,\nmyriads of jelly-like medusas filled the river; it was as though the\nsun’s rays had changed the whole sea into a heaving world of animal\nlife; I had never before seen anything like it. In the Languedoc canal\nwe had all to get into a large boat which had been constructed more for\ngoods than for passengers. The deck was coveted with boxes and trunks,\nand these again occupied by people who sought shade under umbrellas. It\nwas impossible to move; no railing surrounded this pile of boxes and\npeople, which was drawn along by three or four horses attached by long\nropes. Beneath in the cabins it was as crowded; people sat close to\neach other, like flies in a cup of sugar. A lady who had fainted from\nthe heat and tobacco smoke, was carried in and laid upon the only\nunoccupied spot on the floor; she was brought here for air, but here\nthere was none, spite of the number of fans in motion; there were no\nrefreshments to be had, not even a drink of water, except the warm,\nyellow water which the canal afforded. Over the cabin windows hung\nbooted legs, which at the same time that they deprived the cabin of\nlight, seemed to give a substance to the oppressive air. Shut up in\nthis place one had also the torment of being forced to listen to a man\nwho was always trying to say something witty; the stream of words\nplayed about his lips as the canal water about the boat. I made myself\na way through boxes, people, and umbrellas, and stood in a boiling hot\nair; on either side the prospect was eternally the same, green grass, a\ngreen tree, flood-gates–green grass, a green tree, flood-gates–and\nthen again the same; it was enough to drive one insane.",
        "At the distance of a half-hour’s journey from Beziers we were put on\nland; I felt almost ready to faint, and there was no carriage here, for\nthe omnibus had not expected us so early; the sun burnt infernally.\nPeople say the south of France is a portion of Paradise; under the\npresent circumstances it seemed to me a portion of hell with all its\nheat. In Beziers the diligence was waiting, but all the best places\nwere already taken; and I here for the first, and I hope for the last\ntime, got into the hinder part of such a conveyance. An ugly woman in\nslippers, and with a head-dress a yard high, which she hung up, took\nher seat beside me; and now came a singing sailor who had certainly\ndrunk too many healths; then a couple of dirty fellows, whose first\nmanoeuvre was to pull off their boots and coats and sit upon them, hot\nand dirty, whilst the thick clouds of dust whirled into the vehicle,\nand the sun burnt and blinded me. It was impossible to endure this\nfarther than Narbonne; sick and suffering, I sought rest, but then came\ngensdarmes and demanded my passport, and then just as night began, a\nfire must needs break out in the neighboring village; the fire alarm\nresounded, the fire-engines rolled along, it was just as though all\nmanner of tormenting spirits were let loose. From here as far as the\nPyrenees there followed repeated demands for your passport, so\nwearisome that you know nothing like it even in Italy: they gave you as\na reason, the nearness to the Spanish frontiers, the number of\nfugitives from thence, and several murders which had taken place in the\nneighborhood: all conduced to make the journey in my then state of\nhealth a real torment.",
        "I reached Perpignan. The sun had here also swept the streets of people,\nit was only when night came that they came forth, but then it was like\na roaring stream, as though a real tumult were about to destroy the\ntown. The human crowd moved in waves beneath my windows, a loud shout\nresounded; it pierced through my sick frame. What was that?–what did\nit mean? “Good evening, Mr. Arago!” resounded from the strongest\nvoices, thousands repeated it, and music sounded; it was the celebrated\nArago, who was staying in the room next to mine: the people gave him a\nserenade. Now this was the third I had witnessed on my journey. Arago\naddressed them from the balcony, the shouts of the people filled the\nstreets. There are few evenings in my life when I have felt so ill as\non this one, the tumult went through my nerves; the beautiful singing\nwhich followed could not refresh me. Ill as I was, I gave up every\nthought of travelling into Spain; I felt it would be impossible for me.\nAh, if I could only recover strength enough to reach Switzerland! I was\nfilled with horror at the idea of the journey back. I was advised to\nhasten as quickly as possible to the Pyrenees, and there breathe the\nstrengthening mountain air: the baths of Vernet were recommended as\ncool and excellent, and I had a letter of introduction to the head of\nthe establishment there. After an exhausting journey of a night and\nsome hours in the morning, I have reached this place, from whence I\nsent these last sheets. The air is so cool, so strengthening, such as I\nhave not breathed for months. A few days here have entirely restored\nme, my pen flies again over the paper, and my thoughts towards that\nwonderful Spain. I stand like Moses and see the land before me, yet may\nnot tread upon it. But if God so wills it, I will at some future time\nin the winter fly from the north hither into this rich beautiful land,\nfrom which the sun with his sword of flame now holds me back.",
        "Vernet as yet is not one of the well-known bathing places, although it\npossesses the peculiarity of being visited all the year round. The most\ncelebrated visitor last winter was Ibrahim Pacha; his name still lives\non the lips of the hostess and waiter as the greatest glory of the\nestablishment; his rooms were shown first as a curiosity. Among the\nanecdotes current about him is the story of his two French words,\nmerci and tr s bien, which he pronounced in a perfectly\nwrong manner.",
        "In every respect, Vernet among baths is as yet in a state of innocence;\nit is only in point of great bills that the Commandant has been able to\nraise it on a level with the first in Europe. As for the rest, you live\nhere in a solitude, and separated from the world as in no other bathing\nplace: for the amusement of the guests nothing in the least has been\ndone; this must be sought in wanderings on foot or on donkey-back among\nthe mountains; but here all is so peculiar and full of variety, that\nthe want of artificial pleasures is the less felt. It is here as though\nthe most opposite natural productions had been mingled together,–\nnorthern and southern, mountain and valley vegetation. From one point\nyou will look over vineyards, and up to a mountain which appears a\nsample card of corn fields and green meadows, where the hay stands in\ncocks; from another you will only see the naked, metallic rocks with\nstrange crags jutting forth from them, long and narrow as though they\nwere broken statues or pillars; now you walk under poplar trees,\nthrough small meadows, where the balm-mint grows, as thoroughly Danish\na production as though it were cut out of Zealand; now you stand under\nshelter of the rock, where cypresses and figs spring forth among vine\nleaves, and see a piece of Italy. But the soul of the whole, the pulses\nwhich beat audibly in millions through the mountain chain, are the\nsprings. There is a life, a babbling in the ever-rushing waters! It\nsprings forth everywhere, murmurs in the moss, rushes over the great\nstones. There is a movement, a life which it is impossible for words to\ngive; you hear a constant rushing chorus of a million strings; above\nand below you, and all around, you hear the babbling of the river\nnymphs.",
        "High on the cliff, at the edge of a steep precipice, lie the remains of\na Moorish castle; the clouds hang where hung the balcony; the path\nalong which the ass now goes, leads through the hall. From here you can\nenjoy the view over the whole valley, which, long and narrow, seems\nlike a river of trees, which winds among the red scorched rocks; and in\nthe middle of this green valley rises terrace-like on a hill, the\nlittle town of Vernet, which only wants minarets to look like a\nBulgarian town. A miserable church with two long holes as windows, and\nclose to it a ruined tower, form the upper portion, then come the dark\nbrown roofs, and the dirty grey houses with opened shutters instead of\nwindows–but picturesque it certainly is.",
        "But if you enter the town itself–where the apothecary’s shop is, is\nalso the bookseller’s–poverty is the only impression. Almost all the\nhouses are built of unhewn stones, piled one upon another, and two or\nthree gloomy holes form door and windows through which the swallows fly\nout and in. Wherever I entered, I saw through the worn floor of the\nfirst story down into a chaotic gloom beneath. On the wall hangs\ngenerally a bit of fat meat with the hairy skin attached; it was\nexplained to me that this was used to rub their shoes with. The\nsleeping-room is painted in the most glaring manner with saints,\nangels, garlands, and crowns al fresco, as if done when the art\nof painting was in its greatest state of imperfection.",
        "The people are unusually ugly; the very children are real gnomes; the\nexpression of childhood does not soften the clumsy features. But a few\nhours’ journey on the other side of the mountains, on the Spanish side,\nthere blooms beauty, there flash merry brown eyes. The only poetical\npicture I retain of Vernet was this. In the market-place, under a\nsplendidly large tree, a wandering pedlar had spread out all his\nwares,–handkerchiefs, books and pictures,–a whole bazaar, but the\nearth was his table; all the ugly children of the town, burnt through\nby the sun, stood assembled round these splendid things; several old\nwomen looked out from their open shops; on horses and asses the\nvisitors to the bath, ladies and gentlemen, rode by in long procession,\nwhilst two little children, half hid behind a heap of planks; played at\nbeing cocks, and shouted all the time, “kekkeriki!”",
        "Far more of a town, habitable and well-appointed, is the garrison town\nof Villefranche, with its castle of the age of Louis XIV., which lies a\nfew hours’ journey from this place. The road by Olette to Spain passes\nthrough it, and there is also some business; many houses attract your\neye by their beautiful Moorish windows carved in marble. The church is\nbuilt half in the Moorish style, the altars are such as are seen in\nSpanish churches, and the Virgin stands there with the Child, all\ndressed in gold and silver. I visited Villefranche one of the first\ndays of my sojourn here; all the visitors made the excursion with me,\nto which end all the horses and asses far and near were brought\ntogether; horses were put into the Commandant’s venerable coach, and it\nwas occupied by people within and without, just as though it had been a\nFrench public vehicle. A most amiable Holsteiner, the best rider of the\ncompany, the well-known painter Dauzats, a friend of Alexander Dumas’s,\nled the train. The forts, the barracks, and the caves were seen; the\nlittle town of Cornelia also, with its interesting church, was not\npassed over. Everywhere were found traces of the power and art of the\nMoors; everything in this neighborhood speaks more of Spain than\nFrance, the very language wavers between the two.",
        "And here in this fresh mountain nature, on the frontiers of a land\nwhose beauty and defects I am not yet to become acquainted with, I will\nclose these pages, which will make in my life a frontier to coming\nyears, with their beauty and defects. Before I leave the Pyrenees these\nwritten pages will fly to Germany, a great section of my life; I myself\nshall follow, and a new and unknown section will begin.–What may it\nunfold?–I know not, but thankfully, hopefully, I look forward. My\nwhole life, the bright as well as the gloomy days, led to the best. It\nis like a voyage to some known point,–I stand at the rudder, I have\nchosen my path,–but God rules the storm and the sea. He may direct it\notherwise; and then, happen what may, it will be the best for me. This\nfaith is firmly planted in my breast, and makes me happy.",
        "The story of my life, up to the present hour, lies unrolled before me,\nso rich and beautiful that I could not have invented it. I feel that I\nam a child of good fortune; almost every one meets me full of love and\ncandor, and seldom has my confidence in human nature been deceived.\nFrom the prince to the poorest peasant I have felt the noble human\nheart beat. It is a joy to live and to believe in God and man. Openly\nand full of confidence, as if I sat among dear friends, I have here\nrelated the story of my life, have spoken both of my sorrows and joys,\nand have expressed my pleasure at each mark of applause and\nrecognition, as I believe I might even express it before God himself.\nBut then, whether this may be vanity? I know not: my heart was affected\nand humble at the same time, my thought was gratitude to God. That I\nhave related it is not alone because such a biographical sketch as this\nwas desired from me for the collected edition of my works, but because,\nas has been already said, the history of my life will be the best\ncommentary to all my works.",
        "In a few days I shall say farewell to the Pyrenees, and return through\nSwitzerland to dear, kind Germany, where so much joy has flowed into my\nlife, where I possess so many sympathizing friends, where my writings\nhave been so kindly and encouragingly received, and where also these\nsheets will be gently criticized, When the Christmas-tree is lighted,–\nwhen, as people say, the white bees swarm,–I shall be, God willing,\nagain in Denmark with my dear ones, my heart filled with the flowers of\ntravel, and strengthened both in body and mind: then will new works\ngrow upon paper; may God lay his blessing upon them! He will do so. A\nstar of good fortune shines upon me; there are thousands who deserve it\nfar more than I; I often myself cannot conceive why I, in preference to\nnumberless others, should receive so much joy: may it continue to\nshine! But should it set, perhaps whilst I conclude these lines, still\nit has shone, I have received my rich portion; let it set! From this\nalso the best will spring. To God and men my thanks, my love!",
