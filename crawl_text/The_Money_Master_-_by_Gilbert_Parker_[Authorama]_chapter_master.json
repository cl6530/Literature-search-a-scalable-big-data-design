        "This book is in a place by itself among the novels I have written.  Many\ncritics said that it was a welcome return to Canada, where I had made my\nfirst success in the field of fiction.  This statement was only meagrely\naccurate, because since ’The Right of Way’ was published in 1901 I had\nwritten, and given to the public, ’Northern Lights’, a book of short\nstories, ’You Never Know Your Luck’, a short novel, and ’The World for\nSale’, though all of these dealt with life in Western Canada, and not\nwith the life of the French Canadians, in which field I had made my first\nfirm impression upon the public.  In any case, The Money Master was\nfavourably received by the press and public both in England and America,\nand my friends were justified in thinking, and in saying, that I was at\nhome in French Canada and gave the impression of mastery of my material.\nIf mastery of material means a knowledge of the life, and a sympathy with\nit, then my friends are justified; for I have always had an intense\nsympathy with, and admiration for, French Canadian life.  I think the\nFrench Canadian one of the most individual, original, and distinctive\nbeings of the modern world.  He has kept his place, with his own customs,\nhis own Gallic views of life, and his religious habits, with an assiduity\nand firmness none too common.  He is essentially a man of the home, of\nthe soil, and of the stream; he has by nature instinctive philosophy and\ntemperamental logic.  As a lover of the soil of Canada he is not\nsurpassed by any of the other citizens of the country, English or\notherwise.",
        "It would almost seem as though the pageantry of past French Canadian\nhistory, and the beauty and vigour of the topographical surroundings of\nFrench Canadian life, had produced an hereditary pride and exaltation–\nperhaps an excessive pride and a strenuous exaltation, but, in any case,\nthere it was, and is.  The French Canadian lives a more secluded life on\nthe whole than any other citizen of Canada, though the native,\nadventurous spirit has sent him to the Eastern States of the American\nUnion for work in the mills and factories, or up to the farthest reaches\nof the St. Lawrence, Ottawa, and their tributaries in the wood and timber\ntrade.",
        "Domestically he is perhaps the most productive son of the North American\ncontinent.  Families of twenty, or even twenty-five, are not unknown,\nand, when a man has had more than one wife, it has even exceeded that.\nLife itself is full of camaraderie and good spirit, marked by religious\ntraits and sacerdotal influence.",
        "The French Canadian is on the whole sober and industrious; but when he\nbreaks away from sobriety and industry he becomes a vicious element in\nthe general organism.  Yet his vices are of the surface, and do not\ndestroy the foundations of his social and domestic scheme.  A French\nCanadian pony used to be considered the most virile and lasting stock on\nthe continent, and it is fair to say that the French Canadians themselves\nare genuinely hardy, long-lived, virile, and enduring.",
        "It was among such people that the hero of The Money Master, Jean Jacques\nBarbille, lived.  He was the symbol or pattern of their virtues and of\ntheir weaknesses.  By nature a poet, a philosopher, a farmer and an\nadventurer, his life was a sacrifice to prepossession and race instinct;\nto temperament more powerful than logic or common sense, though he was\nalmost professionally the exponent of both.",
        "There is no man so simply sincere, or so extraordinarily prejudiced as\nthe French Canadian.  He is at once modest and vain; he is even lyrical\nin his enthusiasms; he is a child in the intrigues and inventions of\nlife; but he has imagination, he has a heart, he has a love of tradition,\nand is the slave of legend.  To him domestic life is the summum bonum of\nbeing.  His four walls are the best thing which the world has to offer,\nexcept the cheerful and sacred communion of the Mass, and his dismissal\nfrom life itself under the blessing of his priest and with the promise of\na good immortality.",
        "Jean Jacques Barbille had the French Canadian life of pageant, pomp, and\nplace extraordinarily developed.  His love of history and tradition was\nabnormal.  A genius, he was, within an inch, a tragedy to the last\nbutton.  Probably the adventurous spirit of his forefathers played a\ngreater part in his development and in the story of his days than\nanything else.  He was wide-eyed, and he had a big soul.  He trained\nhimself to believe in himself and to follow his own judgment; therefore,\nhe invited loss upon loss, he made mistake upon mistake, he heaped\nfinancial adventure upon financial adventure, he ran great risks; and it\nis possible that his vast belief in himself kept him going when other men\nwould have dropped by the wayside.  He loved his wife and daughter, and\nhe lost them both.  He loved his farms, his mills and his manor, and they\ndisappeared from his control.",
        "It must be remembered that the story of The Money Master really runs for\na generation, and it says something for Jean Jacques Barbille that he\ncould travel through scenes, many of them depressing, for long years, and\nstill, in the end, provoke no disparagement, by marrying the woman who\nhad once out of the goodness of her heart offered him everything–\nherself, her home, her honour; and it was to Jean Jacques’s credit\nthat he took neither until the death of his wife made him free; but the\ntremendous gift offered him produced a powerful impression upon his mind\nand heart.",
        "One of the most distinguished men of the world to-day wrote me in praise\nand protest concerning The Money Master.  He declared that the first half\nof the book was as good as anything that had been done by anybody, and\nthen he bemoaned the fact, which he believed, that the author had\nsacrificed his two heroines without real cause and because he was tired\nof them.  There he was wrong.  In the author’s mind the story was planned\nexactly as it worked out.  He was never tired; he was resolute.  He was\nintent to produce, if possible, a figure which would breed and develop\nits own disasters, which would suffer profoundly for its own mistakes;\nbut which, in the end, would triumph over the disasters of life and time.\nIt was all deliberate in the main intention and plan.  Any failures that\nexist in the book are due to the faults of the author, and to nothing\nelse.",
        "Some critics have been good enough to call ’The Money Master’ a beautiful\nbook, and there are many who said that it was real, true, and faithful.\nPersonally I think it is real and true, and as time goes on, and we get\nolder, that is what seems to matter to those who love life and wish to\nsee it well harvested.",
        "I do not know what the future of the book may be; what the future of any\nwork of mine will be; but I can say this, that no one has had the\npleasure in reading my books which I have had in making them.  They have\nbeen ground out of the raw material of the soul.  I have a hope that they\nwill outlast my brief day, but, in any case, it will not matter.  They\nhave given me a chance of showing to the world life as I have seen it,\nand indirectly, and perhaps indistinctly, my own ideas of that life.\n’The Money Master’ is a vivid and somewhat emotional part of it.",
        "“Peace and plenty, peace and plenty\"–that was the phrase M. Jean Jacques\nBarbille, miller and moneymaster, applied to his home-scene, when he was\nat the height of his career.  Both winter and summer the place had a look\nof content and comfort, even a kind of opulence.  There is nothing like a\ngrove of pines to give a sense of warmth in winter and an air of coolness\nin summer, so does the slightest breeze make the pine-needles swish like\nthe freshening sea.  But to this scene, where pines made a friendly\nbackground, there were added oak, ash, and hickory trees, though in less\nquantity on the side of the river where were Jean Jacques Barbille’s\nhouse and mills.  They flourished chiefly on the opposite side of the\nBeau Cheval, whose waters flowed so waywardly–now with a rush, now\nsilently away through long reaches of country.  Here the land was rugged\nand bold, while farther on it became gentle and spacious, and was flecked\nor striped with farms on which low, white houses with dormer-windows and\nbig stoops flashed to the passer-by the message of the pioneer, “It is\nmine.  I triumph.”",
        "At the Manor Cartier, not far from the town of Vilray, where Jean Jacques\nwas master, and above it and below it, there had been battles and the\nravages of war.  At the time of the Conquest the stubborn habitants,\nrefusing to accept the yielding of Quebec as the end of French power\nin their proud province, had remained in arms and active, and had only\nyielded when the musket and the torch had done their work, and smoking\nruins marked the places where homes had been.  They took their fortune\nwith something of the heroic calm of men to whom an idea was more than\naught else.  Jean Jacques’ father, grandfather, and great-great-\ngrandfather had lived here, no one of them rising far, but none worthless\nor unnoticeable.  They all had had “a way of their own,” as their\nneighbours said, and had been provident on the whole.  Thus it was that\nwhen Jean Jacques’ father died, and he came into his own, he found\nhimself at thirty a man of substance, unmarried, who “could have had the\npick of the province.”  This was what the Old Cure said in despair, when\nJean Jacques did the incomprehensible thing, and married l’Espagnole, or\n\"the Spanische,” as the lady was always called in the English of the\nhabitant.",
        "When she came it was spring-time, and all the world was budding, exuding\njoy and hope, with the sun dancing over all.  It was the time between\nthe sowing and the hay-time, and there was a feeling of alertness in\neverything that had life, while even the rocks and solid earth seemed to\nstir.  The air was filled with the long happy drone of the mill-stones as\nthey ground the grain; and from farther away came the soft, stinging cry\nof a saw-mill.  Its keen buzzing complaint was harmonious with the\ngrumble of the mill-stones, as though a supreme maker of music had tuned\nit.  So said a master-musician and his friend, a philosopher from Nantes,\nwho came to St. Saviour’s in the summer just before the marriage, and\nlodged with Jean Jacques.  Jean Jacques, having spent a year at Laval\nUniversity at Quebec, had almost a gift of thought, or thinking; and he\nnever ceased to ply the visiting philosopher and musician with questions\nwhich he proceeded to answer himself before they could do so; his quaint,\nsentimental, meretricious observations on life saddening while they\namused his guests.  They saddened the musician more than the other\nbecause he knew life, while the philosopher only thought it and saw it.",
        "But even the musician would probably have smiled in hope that day when\nthe young “Spanische” came driving up the river-road from the steamboat-\nlanding miles away.  She arrived just when the clock struck noon in the\nbig living-room of the Manor.  As she reached the open doorway and the\nwide windows of the house which gaped with shady coolness, she heard the\nbell summoning the workers in the mills and on the farm–yes, M. Barbille\nwas a farmer, too–for the welcome home to “M’sieu’ Jean Jacques,” as he\nwas called by everyone.",
        "That the wedding had taken place far down in Gaspe and not in St.\nSaviour’s was a reproach and almost a scandal; and certainly it was\nunpatriotic.  It was bad enough to marry the Spanische, but to marry\noutside one’s own parish, and so deprive that parish and its young people\nof the week’s gaiety, which a wedding and the consequent procession and\ntour through the parish brings, was little less than treason.  But there\nit was; and Jean Jacques was a man who had power to hurt, to hinder, or\nto help; for the miller and the baker are nearer to the hearthstone of\nevery man than any other, and credit is a good thing when the oven is\nempty and hard times are abroad.  The wedding in Gaspe had not been\nattended by the usual functions, for it had all been hurriedly arranged,\nas the romantic circumstances of the wooing required.  Romance indeed it\nwas; so remarkable that the master-musician might easily have found a\ntheme for a comedy–or tragedy–and the philosopher would have shaken his\nhead at the defiance it offered to the logic of things.",
        "Now this is the true narrative, though in the parish of St. Saviour’s it\nis more highly decorated and has many legends hanging to it like tassels\nto a curtain.  Even the Cure of to-day, who ought to know all the truth,\nfinds it hard to present it in its bare elements; for the history of Jean\nJacques Barbille affected the history of many a man in St. Saviour’s; and\nall that befel him, whether of good or evil, ran through the parish in a\nthousand invisible threads.",
        "What had happened was this.  After the visit of the musician and the\nphilosopher, Jean Jacques, to sustain his reputation and to increase it,\nhad decided to visit that Normandy from which his people had come at the\ntime of Frontenac.  He set forth with much ’eclat’ and a little innocent\nposturing and ritual, in which a cornet and a violin figured, together\nwith a farewell oration by the Cure.",
        "In Paris Jean Jacques had found himself bewildered and engulfed.  He had\nno idea that life could be so overbearing, and he was inclined to resent\nhis own insignificance.  However, in Normandy, when he read the names on\nthe tombstones and saw the records in the baptismal register of other\nJean Jacques Barbilles, who had come and gone generations before, his\nself-respect was somewhat restored.  This pleasure was dashed, however,\nby the quizzical attitude of the natives of his ancestral parish, who\nwalked round about inspecting him as though he were a zoological\nspecimen, and who criticized his accent–he who had been at Laval for one\nwhole term; who had had special instruction before that time from the Old\nCure and a Jesuit brother; and who had been the friend of musicians and\nphilosophers!",
        "His cheerful, kindly self-assurance stood the test with difficulty, but\nit became a kind of ceremonial with him, whenever he was discomfited, to\nread some pages of a little dun-coloured book of philosophy, picked up on\nthe quay at Quebec just before he sailed, and called, “Meditations in\nPhilosophy.”  He had been warned by the bookseller that the Church had no\nlove for philosophy; but while at Laval he had met the independent minds\nthat, at eighteen to twenty-two, frequent academic groves; and he was not\nto be put off by the pious bookseller–had he not also had a philosopher\nin his house the year before, and was he not going to Nantes to see this\nsame savant before returning to his beloved St. Saviour’s parish.",
        "But Paris and Nantes and Rouen and Havre abashed and discomfited him,\nplayed havoc with his self-esteem, confused his brain, and vexed him by\nformality, and, more than all, by their indifference to himself.  He\nadmired, yet he wished to be admired; he was humble, but he wished all\npeople and things to be humble with him.  When he halted he wanted the\nworld to halt; when he entered a cathedral–Notre Dame or any other; or a\ngreat building–the Law Courts at Rouen or any other; he simply wanted\npeople to say, wanted the cathedral, or at least the cloister, to whisper\nto itself, “Here comes Jean Jacques Barbille.”",
        "That was all he wanted, and that would have sufficed.  He would not have\nhad them whisper about his philosophy and his intellect, or the mills and\nthe ash-factory which he meant to build, the lime-kilns he had started\neven before he left, and the general store he intended to open when he\nreturned to St. Saviour’s.  Not even his modesty was recognized; and, in\nhis grand tour, no one was impressed by all that he was, except once.  An\nancestor, a grandmother of his, had come from the Basque country; and so\ndown to St. Jean Pied de Port he went; for he came of a race who set\ngreat store by mothers and grandmothers.  At St. Jean Pied de Port he was\nmore at home.  He was, in a sense, a foreigner among foreigners there,\nand the people were not quizzical, since he was an outsider in any case\nand not a native returned, as he had been in Normandy.  He learned to\nplay pelota, the Basque game taken from the Spaniards, and he even\nallowed himself a little of that oratory which, as they say, has its\nhabitat chiefly in Gascony.  And because he had found an audience at\nlast, he became a liberal host, and spent freely of his dollars, as he\nhad never done either in Normandy, Paris, or elsewhere.  So freely did he\nspend, that when he again embarked at Bordeaux for Quebec, he had only\nenough cash left to see him through the remainder of his journey in the\ngreat world.  Yet he left France with his self-respect restored, and he\neven waved her a fond adieu, as the creaking Antoine broke heavily into\nthe waters of the Bay of Biscay, while he cried:",
        "                         “My little ship,\n                         It bears me far\n                         From lights of home\n                         To alien star.\n                         O vierge Marie,\n                         Pour moi priez Dieu!\n                         Adieu, dear land,\n                         Provence, adieu.”",
        "Then a further wave of sentiment swept over him, and he was vaguely\nconscious of a desire to share the pains of parting which he saw in\nlabour around him–children from parents, lovers from loved.  He could\nnot imagine the parting from a parent, for both of his were in the bosom\nof heaven, having followed his five brothers, all of whom had died in\ninfancy, to his good fortune, for otherwise his estate would now be only\none-sixth of what it was.  But he could imagine a parting with some sweet\ndaughter of France, and he added another verse to the thrilling of the\nheart of Casimir Delavigne:",
        "                         “Beloved Isaure,\n                         Her hand makes sign–\n                         No more, no more,\n                         To rest in mine.\n                         O vierge Marie,\n                         Pour moi priez Dieu!\n                         Adieu, dear land,\n                         Isaure, adieu!”",
        "As he murmured with limpid eye the last words, he saw in the forecastle\nnot far from him a girl looking at him.  There was unmistakable sadness\nin her glance of interest.  In truth she was thinking of just such a man\nas Jean Jacques, whom she could never see any more, for he had paid with\nhis life the penalty of the conspiracy in which her father, standing now\nbehind her on the leaky Antoine, had been a tool, and an evil tool.  Here\nin Jean Jacques was the same ruddy brown face, black restless eye, and\nyoung, silken, brown beard.  Also there was an air of certainty and\nuniversal comprehension, and though assertion and vanity were apparent,\nthere was no self-consciousness.  The girl’s dead and gone conspirator\nhad not the same honesty of face, the same curve of the ideal in the\nbroad forehead, the same poetry of rich wavy brown hair, the same\ngoodness of mind and body so characteristic of Jean Jacques–he was but\nJean Jacques gone wrong at the start; but the girl was of a nature that\ncould see little difference between things which were alike\nsuperficially, and in the young provincial she only saw one who looked\nlike the man she had loved.  True, his moustaches did not curl upwards at\nthe ends as did those of Carvillho Gonzales, and he did not look out of\nthe corner of his eyes and smoke black cigarettes; but there he was, her\nCarvillho with a difference–only such a difference that made him to her\nCarvillho II., and not the ghost of Carvillho I.",
        "She was a maiden who might have been as good as need be for all life,\nso far as appearances went.  She had a wonderful skin, a smooth, velvety\ncheek, where faint red roses came and went, as it might seem at will;\nwith a deep brown eye; and eh, but she was grandly tall–so Jean Jacques\nthought, while he drew himself up to his full five feet, six and a half\nwith a determined air.  Even at his best, however, Jean Jacques could not\nreach within three inches of her height.",
        "Yet he did not regard her as at all overdone because of that.  He thought\nher hair very fine, as it waved away from her low forehead in a grace\nwhich reminded him of the pictures of the Empress Eugenie, and of the\nsister of that monsieur le duc who had come fishing to St. Saviour’s a\nfew years before.  He thought that if her hair was let down it would\nprobably reach to her waist, and maybe to her ankles.  She had none of\nthe plump, mellow softness of the beauties he had seen in the Basque\ncountry.  She was a slim and long limbed Diana, with fine lines and a\nbosom of extreme youth, though she must have been twenty-one her last\nbirthday.  The gown she wore was a dark green well-worn velvet, which\nseemed of too good a make and quality for her class; and there was no\ndecoration about her anywhere, save at the ears, where two drops of gold\nhung on little links an inch and a half long.",
        "Jean Jacques Barbille’s eyes took it all in with that observation of\nwhich he was so proud and confident, and rested finally on the drops of\ngold at her ears.  Instinctively he fingered the heavy gold watch-chain\nhe had bought in Paris to replace the silver chain with a little crucifix\ndangling, which his father and even his great-grandfather had worn before\nhim.  He had kept the watch, however–the great fat-bellied thing which\nhad never run down in a hundred years.  It was his mascot.  To lose that\nwatch would be like losing his share in the promises of the Church.  So\nhis fingers ran along the new gold-fourteen-carat-chain, to the watch at\nthe end of it; and he took it out a little ostentatiously, since he saw\nthat the eyes of the girl were on him.  Involuntarily he wished to\nimpress her.",
        "He might have saved himself the trouble.  She was impressed.  It was\nquite another matter however, whether he would have been pleased to know\nthat the impression was due to his resemblance to a Spanish conspirator,\nwhose object was to destroy the Monarchy and the Church, as had been the\nobject of the middle-aged conspirator–the girl’s father–who had the\ngood fortune to escape from justice.  It is probable that if Jean Jacques\nhad known these facts, his story would never have been written, and he\nwould have died in course of time with twenty children and a seat in the\nlegislature; for, in spite of his ardent devotion to philosophy and its\naccompanying rationalism, he was a devout monarchist and a child of the\nChurch.",
        "Sad enough it was that, as he shifted his glance from the watch, which\nticked loud enough to wake a farmhand in the middle of the day, he found\nthose Spanish eyes which had been so lost in studying him.  In the glow\nand glisten of the evening sun setting on the shores of Bordeaux, and\nflashing reflected golden light to the girl’s face, he saw that they were\nshining with tears, and though looking at him, appeared not to see him.\nIn that moment the scrutiny of the little man’s mind was volatilized, and\nthe Spanische, as she was ultimately called, began her career in the life\nof the money-master of St. Saviour’s.",
        "It began by his immediately resenting the fact that she should be\ntravelling in the forecastle.  His mind imagined misfortune and a lost\nhome through political troubles, for he quickly came to know that the\ngirl and her father were Spanish; and to him, Spain was a place of\nmartyrs and criminals.  Criminals these could not be–one had but to\nlook at the girl’s face; while the face of her worthless father might\nhave been that of a friend of Philip IV. in the Escorial, so quiet and\noppressed it seemed.  Nobility was written on the placid, apathetic\ncountenance, except when it was not under observation, and then the look\nof Cain took its place.  Jean Jacques, however, was not likely to see\nthat look; since Sebastian Dolores–that was his name–had observed from\nthe first how the master-miller was impressed by his daughter, and he was\nset to turn it to account.",
        "Not that the father entered into an understanding with the girl.  He knew\nher too well for that.  He had a wholesome respect, not to say fear, of\nher; for when all else had failed, it was she who had arranged his escape\nfrom Spain, and who almost saved Carvillho Gonzales from being shot.  She\ncould have saved Gonzales, might have saved him, would have saved him,\nhad she not been obliged to save her father.  In the circumstances she\ncould not save both.",
        "Before the week was out Jean Jacques was possessed of as fine a tale of\npolitical persecution as mind could conceive, and, told as it was by\nSebastian Dolores, his daughter did not seek to alter it, for she had\nher own purposes, and they were mixed.  These refugees needed a friend,\nfor they would land in Canada with only a few dollars, and Carmen Dolores\nloved her father well enough not to wish to see him again in such\ndistress as he had endured in Cadiz.  Also, Jean Jacques, the young,\nverdant, impressionable French Catholic, was like her Carvillho Gonzales,\nand she had loved her Carvillho in her own way very passionately, and–\nthis much to her credit–quite chastely.  So that she had no compunction\nin drawing the young money-master to her side, and keeping him there by\nsuch arts as such a woman possesses.  These are remarkable after their\nkind.  They are combined of a frankness as to the emotions, and such\nouter concessions to physical sensations, as make a painful combination\nagainst a mere man’s caution; even when that caution has a Norman origin.",
        "More than once Jean Jacques was moved to tears, as the Ananias of Cadiz\ntold his stories of persecution.",
        "So that one day, in sudden generosity, he paid the captain the necessary\nsum to transfer the refugees from the forecastle to his own select\nportion of the steamer, where he was so conspicuous a figure among a\nhandful of lower-level merchant folk and others of little mark who were\ngoing to Quebec.  To these latter Jean Jacques was a gift of heaven, for\nhe knew so much, and seemed to know so much more, and could give them the\ninformation they desired.  His importance lured him to pose as a\nseigneur, though he had no claim to the title.  He did not call himself\nSeigneur in so many words, but when others referred to him as the\nSeigneur, and it came to his ears, he did not correct it; and when he was\naddressed as such he did not reprove.",
        "Thus, when he brought the two refugees from the forecastle and assured\nhis fellow-passengers that they were Spanish folk of good family exiled\nby persecution, his generosity was acclaimed, even while all saw he was\nenamoured of Carmen.  Once among the first-class passengers, father and\ndaughter maintained reserve, and though there were a few who saw that\nthey were not very far removed above peasants, still the dress of the\ngirl, which was good–she had been a maid in a great nobleman’s family\n–was evidence in favour of the father’s story.  Sebastian Dolores\nexplained his own workman’s dress as having been necessary for his\nescape.",
        "Only one person gave Jean Jacques any warning.  This was the captain\nof the Antoine.  He was a Basque, he knew the Spanish people well–the\ntypes, the character, the idiosyncrasies; and he was sure that Sebastian\nDolores and his daughter belonged to the lower clerical or higher working\nclass, and he greatly inclined towards the former.  In that he was right,\nbecause Dolores, and his father before him, had been employed in the\noffice of a great commercial firm in Cadiz, and had repaid much\nconsideration by stirring up strife and disloyalty in the establishment.\nBut before the anarchist subtracted himself from his occupation, he had\nappropriated certain sums of money, and these had helped to carry him on,\nwhen he attached himself to the revolutionaries.  It was on his\ndaughter’s savings that he was now travelling, with the only thing he\nhad saved from the downfall, which was his head.  It was of sufficient\npersonal value to make him quite cheerful as the Antoine plunged and\nshivered on her way to the country where he could have no steady work\nas a revolutionist.",
        "With reserve and caution the Basque captain felt it his duty to tell Jean\nJacques of his suspicions, warning him that the Spaniards were the\nchoicest liars in the world, and were not ashamed of it; but had the same\npride in it as had their greatest rivals, the Arabs and the Egyptians.",
        "His discreet confidences, however, were of no avail; he was not discreet\nenough.  If he had challenged the bona fides of Sebastian Dolores only,\nhe might have been convincing, but he used the word “they” constantly,\nand that roused the chivalry of Jean Jacques.  That the comely, careful\nCarmen should be party to an imposture was intolerable.  Everything about\nher gave it the lie.  Her body was so perfect and complete, so finely\ncontrived and balanced, so cunningly curved with every line filled in;\nher eye was so full of lustre and half-melancholy too; her voice had such\na melodious monotone; her mouth was so ripe and yet so distant in its\nluxury, that imposture was out of the question.",
        "Ah, but Jean Jacques was a champion worth while!  He did nothing by\nhalves.  He was of the breed of men who grow more intense, more\nconvinced, more thorough, as they talk.  One adjective begets another,\none warm allusion gives birth to a warmer, one flashing impulse evokes a\nbrighter confidence, till the atmosphere is flaming with conviction.  If\nJean Jacques started with faint doubt regarding anything, and allowed\nhimself betimes the flush of a declaration of belief, there could be but\none end.  He gathered fire as he moved, impulse expanded into momentum,\nand momentum became an Ariel fleeing before the dark.  He would start by\noffering a finger to be pricked, and would end by presenting his own head\non a charger.  He was of those who hypnotize themselves, who glow with\nself-creation, who flower and bloom without pollen.",
        "His rejection of the captain’s confidence even had a dignity.  He took\nout his watch which represented so many laborious hours of other\nBarbilles, and with a decision in which the strong pulse of chivalry was\nbeating hard, he said:",
        "“I can never speak well till I have ate.  That is my hobby.  Well, so it\nis.  And I like good company.  So that is why I sit beside Senor and\nSenorita Dolores at table–the one on the right, the other on the left,\nmyself between, like this, like that.  It is dinner-time now here, and\nmy friends–my dear friends of Cadiz–they wait me.  Have you heard the\nSenorita sing the song of Spain, m’sieu’?  What it must be with the\nguitar, I know not; but with voice alone it is ravishing.  I have learned\nit also.  The Senorita has taught me.  It is a song of Aragon.  It is\nsung in high places.  It belongs to the nobility.  Ah, then, you have not\nheard it–but it is not too late!  The Senorita, the unhappy ma’m’selle,\ndriven from her ancestral home by persecution, she will sing it to you as\nshe has sung it to me.  It is your due.  You are the master of the ship.\nBut, yes, she shall of her kindness and of her grace sing it to you.  You\ndo not know how it runs?  Well, it is like this–listen and tell me if it\ndoes not speak of things that belong to the old regime, the ancient\nnoblesse–listen, m’sieu’ le captaanne, how it runs:",
        "              “Have you not heard of mad Murcie?\n               Granada gay and And’lousie?\n               There’s where you’ll see the joyous rout,\n               When patios pour their beauties out;\n               Come, children, come, the night gains fast,\n               And Time’s a jade too fair to last.\n               My flower of Spain, my Juanetta,\n               Away, away to gay Jota!\n               Come forth, my sweet, away, my queen,\n               Though daybreak scorns, the night’s between.\n               The Fete’s afoot–ah!  ah!  ah!  ah!\n               De la Jota Ar’gonesa.\n               Ah!   ah!  ah!  ah!  ah!  ah!  ah! ah!\n               De la Jota Ar’gonesa.”",
        "Before he had finished, the captain was more than ready to go, for he had\nno patience with such credulity, simplicity and sentimentalism.  He was\nBasque, and to be Basque is to lack sentiment and feel none, to play ever\nfor the safe thing, to get without giving, and to mind your own business.\nIt had only been an excessive sense of duty which had made the captain\nmove in this, for he liked Jean Jacques as everyone aboard his Antoine\ndid; and he was convinced that the Spaniards would play the “Seigneur” to\nthe brink of disaster at least, though it would have been hard to detect\nany element of intrigue or coquetry in Carmen Dolores.",
        "That was due partly to the fact that she was still in grief for her\nGonzales, whose heart had been perforated by almost as many bullets as\nthe arrows of Cupid had perforated it in his short, gay life of adventure\nand anarchy; also partly because there was no coquetry needed to interest\nJean Jacques.  If he was interested it was not necessary to interest\nanyone else, nor was it expedient to do so, for the biggest fish in the\nnet on the Antoine was the money-master of St. Saviour’s.",
        "Carmen had made up her mind from the first to marry Jean Jacques, and she\ndeported herself accordingly–with modesty, circumspection and skill.  It\nwould be the easiest way out of all their difficulties.  Since her heart,\nsuch as it was, fluttered, a mournful ghost, over the Place d’Armes,\nwhere her Gonzales was shot, it might better go to Jean Jacques than\nanyone else; for he was a man of parts, of money, and of looks, and she\nloved these all; and to her credit she loved his looks better than all\nthe rest.  She had no real cupidity, and she was not greatly enamoured of\nbrains.  She had some real philosophy of life learned in a hard school;\nand it was infinitely better founded than the smattering of conventional\nphilosophy got by Jean Jacques from his compendium picked up on the quay\nat Quebec.",
        "Yet Jean Jacques’ cruiser of life was not wholly unarmed.  From his\nNorman forebears he had, beneath all, a shrewdness and an elementary\nalertness not submerged by his vain, kind nature.  He was quite a good\nbusiness man, and had proved himself so before his father died–very\nquick to see a chance, and even quicker to see where the distant,\nsharp corners in the road were; though not so quick to see the pitfalls,\nfor his head was ever in the air.  And here on the Antoine, there crossed\nhis mind often the vision of Carmen Dolores and himself in the parish of\nSt. Saviour’s, with the daily life of the Beau Cheval revolving about\nhim.  Flashes of danger warned him now and then, just at the beginning of\nthe journey, as it were; just before he had found it necessary to become\nher champion against the captain and his calumnies; but they were of the\ninstant only.  But champion as he became, and worshipping as his manner\nseemed, it all might easily have been put down to a warm, chivalrous, and\nspontaneous nature, which had not been bitted or bridled, and he might\nhave landed at Quebec without committing himself, were it not for the\nfact that he was not to land at Quebec.",
        "That was the fact which controlled his destiny.  He had spent many, many\nhours with the Dona Dolores, talking, talking, as he loved to talk, and\nonly saving himself from the betise of boring her by the fact that his\nenthusiasm had in it so fresh a quality, and because he was so like\nher Gonzales that she could always endure him.  Besides, quick of\nintelligence as she was, she was by nature more material than she looked,\nand there was certainly something physically attractive in him–some\ncurious magnetism.  She had a well of sensuousness which might one day\nbecome sensuality; she had a richness of feeling and a contour in harmony\nwith it, which might expand into voluptuousness, if given too much sun,\nor if untamed by the normal restraints of a happy married life.  There\nwas an earthquake zone in her being which might shake down the whole\nstructure of her existence.  She was unsafe, not because she was\ndeceiving Jean Jacques now as to her origin and as to her feelings for\nhim; she was unsafe because of the natural strain of the light of love\nin her, joined to a passion for comfort and warmth and to a natural self-\nindulgence.  She was determined to make Jean Jacques offer himself before\nthey landed at Quebec.",
        "But they did not land at Quebec.",
        "The journey wore on to the coast of Canada.  Gaspe was not far off when,\nstill held back by the constitutional tendency of the Norman not to close\na bargain till compelled to do so, Jean Jacques sat with Carmen far\nforward on the deck, where the groaning Antoine broke the waters into\nsullen foam.  There they silently watched the sunset, golden, purple and\nsplendid–and ominous, as the captain knew.",
        "“Look, the end of life–like that!” said Jean Jacques oratorically with\na wave of the hand towards the prismatic radiance.",
        "“All the way round, the whole circle–no, it would be too much,” Carmen\nreplied sadly.  “Better to go at noon–or soon after.  Then the only\nmemory of life would be of the gallop.  No crawling into the night for\nme, if I can help it.  Mother of Heaven, no!  Let me go at the top of the\nflight.”",
        "“It is all the same to me,” responded Jean Jacques, “I want to know it\nall–to gallop, to trot, to walk, to crawl.  Me, I’m a philosopher.  I\nwait.”",
        "“But I thought you were a Catholic,” she replied, with a kindly, lurking\nsmile, which might easily have hardened into scoffing.",
        "“First and last,” he answered firmly.",
        "“A Catholic and a philosopher–together in one?”  She shrugged a shoulder\nto incite him to argument, for he was interesting when excited; when\nspurting out little geysers of other people’s cheap wisdom and\nphilosophy, poured through the kind distortion of his own intelligence.",
        "He gave a toss of his head.  “Ah, that is my hobby–I reconcile, I unite,\nI adapt!  It is all the nature of the mind, the far-look, the all-round\nsight of the man.  I have it all.  I see.”",
        "He gazed eloquently into the sunset, he swept the horizon with his hand.\n\"I have the all-round look.  I say the Man of Calvary, He is before all,\nthe sun; but I say Socrates, Plato, Jean Jacques–that is my name, and it\nis not for nothing, that–Jean Jacques Rousseau, Descartes, Locke, they\nare stars that go round the sun.  It is the same light, but not the same\nsound.  I reconcile.  In me all comes together like the spokes to the hub\nof a wheel.  Me–I am a Christian, I am philosophe, also.  In St.\nSaviour’s, my home in Quebec, if the crops are good, what do men say?\n’C’est le bon Dieu–it is the good God,’ that is what they say.  If the\ncrops are bad, what do they say?  ’It is the good God’–that is what they\nsay.  It is the good God that makes crops good or bad, and it is the good\nGod that makes men say, ’C’est le bon Dieu.’ The good God makes the\nphilosophy.  It is all one.”",
        "She appeared to grow agitated, and her voice shook as she spoke.  “Tsh,\nit is only a fool that says the good God does it, when the thing that is\ndone breaks you or that which you love all to pieces.  No, no, no, it is\nnot religion, it is not philosophy that makes one raise the head when the\nheart is bowed down, when everything is snatched away that was all in\nall.  That the good God does it is a lie.  Santa Maria, what a lie!”",
        "“Why ’Santa Maria,’ then, if it is a lie?” he asked triumphantly.  He\ndid not observe how her breast was heaving, how her hands were clenched;\nfor she was really busy with thoughts of her dead Carvillho Gonzales; but\nfor the moment he could only see the point of an argument.",
        "She made a gesture of despair.  “So–that’s it.  Habit in us is so\nstrong.  It comes through the veins of our mothers to us.  We say that\nGod is a lie one minute, and then the next minute we say, ’God guard\nyou!’  Always–always calling to something, for something outside\nourselves.  That is why I said Santa Maria, why I ask her to pray for the\nsoul of my friend, to pray to the God that breaks me and mine, and sends\nus over the seas, beggars without a home.”",
        "Now she had him back out of the vanities of his philosophy.  He was up,\ninflamed, looking at her with an excitement on which she depended for her\nfuture.  She knew the caution of his nature, she realized how he would\ntake one step forward and another step back, and maybe get nowhere in the\nend, and she wanted him–for a home, for her father’s sake, for what he\ncould do for them both.  She had no compunctions.  She thought herself\ntoo good for him, in a way, for in her day men of place and mark had\ntaken notice of her; and if it had not been for her Gonzales she would no\ndoubt have listened to one of them sometime or another.  She knew she had\nability, even though she was indolent, and she thought she could do as\nmuch for him as any other girl.  If she gave him a handsome wife and\nhandsome children, and made men envious of him, and filled him with good\nthings, for she could cook more than tortillas-she felt he would have no\nright to complain.  She meant him to marry her–and Quebec was very near!",
        "“A beggar in a strange land, without a home, without a friend–oh, my\nbroken life!” she whispered wistfully to the sunset.",
        "It was not all acting, for the past reached out and swept over her,\nthrowing waves of its troubles upon the future.  She was that saddest\nof human beings, a victim of dual forces which so fought for mastery with\neach other that, while the struggle went on, the soul had no firm\nfoothold anywhere.  That, indeed, was why her Carvillho Gonzales, who\nalso had been dual in nature, said to himself so often, “I am a devil,\"\nand nearly as often, “I have the heart of an angel.”",
        "“Tell me all about your life, my friend,” Jean Jacques said eagerly.  Now\nhis eyes no longer hurried here and there, but fastened on hers and\nstayed thereabouts–ah, her face surely was like pictures he had seen in\nthe Louvre that day when he had ambled through the aisles of great men’s\nglories with the feeling that he could not see too much for nothing in an\nhour.",
        "“My life?  Ah, m’sieu’, has not my father told you of it?” she asked.",
        "He waved a hand in explanation, he cocked his head quizzically.  “Scraps\n–like the buttons on a coat here and there–that’s all,” he answered.\n\"Born in Andalusia, lived in Cadiz, plenty of money, a beautiful home,\"\n–Carmen’s eyes drooped, and her face flushed slightly–\"no brothers or\nsisters–visits to Madrid on political business–you at school–then the\ngoing of your mother, and you at home at the head of the house.  So much\non the young shoulders, the kitchen, the parlour, the market, the shop,\nsociety–and so on.  That is the way it was, so he said, except in the\nlast sad times, when your father, for the sake of Don Carlos and his\nrights, near lost his life–ah, I can understand that: to stand by the\nthing you have sworn to!  France is a republic, but I would give my life\nto put a Napoleon or a Bourbon on the throne.  It is my hobby to stand by\nthe old ship, not sign on to a new captain every port.”",
        "She raised her head and looked at him calmly now.  The flush had gone\nfrom her face, and a light of determination was in her eyes.  To that was\nadded suddenly a certain tinge of recklessness and abandon in carriage\nand manner, as one flings the body loose from the restraints of clothes,\nand it expands in a free, careless, defiant joy.",
        "Jean Jacques’ recital of her father’s tale had confused her for a moment,\nit was so true yet so untrue, so full of lies and yet so solid in fact.\n\"The head of the house–visits to Madrid on political business–the\nparlour, the market, society–all that!”  It suggested the picture of the\nlife of a child of a great house; it made her a lady, and not a superior\nservant as she had been; it adorned her with a credit which was not hers;\nand for a moment she was ashamed.  Yet from the first she had lent\nherself to the general imposture that they had fled from Spain for\npolitical reasons, having lost all and suffered greatly; and it was true\nwhile yet it was a lie.  She had suffered, both her father and herself\nhad suffered; she had been in danger, in agony, in sorrow, in despair–\nit was only untrue that they were of good birth and blood, and had had\nposition and comfort and much money.  Well, what harm did that do\nanybody?  What harm did it do this little brown seigneur from Quebec?\nPerhaps he too had made himself out to be more than he was.  Perhaps he\nwas no seigneur at all, she thought.  When one is in distant seas and in\ndanger of his life, one will hoist any flag, sail to any port, pay homage\nto any king.  So would she.  Anyhow, she was as good as this provincial,\nwith his ancient silver watch, his plump little hands, and his book of\nphilosophy.",
        "What did it matter, so all came right in the end!  She would justify\nherself, if she had the chance.  She was sick of conspiracy, and danger,\nand chicanery–and blood.  She wanted her chance.  She had been badly\nshaken in the last days in Spain, and she shrank from more worry and\nmisery.  She wanted to have a home and not to wander.  And here was a\nchance–how good a chance she was not sure; but it was a chance.  She\nwould not hesitate to make it hers.  After all, self-preservation was the\nthing which mattered.  She wanted a bright fire, a good table, a horse,\na cow, and all such simple things.  She wanted a roof over her and a warm\nbed at night.  She wanted a warm bed at night–but a warm bed at night\nalone.  It was the price she would have to pay for her imposture, that if\nshe had all these things, she could not be alone in the sleep-time.  She\nhad not thought of this in the days when she looked forward to a home\nwith her Gonzales.  To be near him was everything; but that was all dead\nand done for; and now–it was at this point that, shrinking, she suddenly\nthrew off all restraining thoughts.  With abandon of the mind came a\nrecklessness of body, which gave her, all at once, a voluptuousness more\nin keeping with the typical maid of Andalusia.  It got into the eyes and\nsenses of Jean Jacques, in a way which had nothing to do with the\nphilosophy of Descartes, or Kant, or Aristotle, or Hegel.",
        "“It was beautiful in much–my childhood,” she said in a low voice,\ndropping her eyes before his ardent gaze, “as my father said.  My mother\nwas lovely to see, but not bigger than I was at twelve–so petite, and\nyet so perfect in form–like a lark or a canary.  Yes, and she could\nsing–anything.  Not like me with a voice which has the note of a drum or\nan organ–”",
        "“Of a flute, bright Senorita,” interposed Jean Jacques.",
        "“But high, and with the trills in the skies, and all like a laugh with a\ntear in it.  When she went to the river to wash–”",
        "She was going to say “wash the clothes,” but she stopped in time and said\ninstead, “wash her spaniel and her pony\"–her face was flushed again with\nshame, for to lie about one’s mother is a sickening thing, and her mother\nnever had a spaniel or a pony–” the women on the shore wringing their\nclothes, used to beg her to sing.  To the hum of the river she would make\nthe music which they loved–”",
        "“La Manola and such?” interjected Jean Jacques eagerly.  “That’s a fine\nsong as you sing it.”",
        "“Not La Manola, but others of a different sort–The Love of Isabella, The\nFlight of Bobadil, Saragosse, My Little Banderillero, and so on, and all\nso sweet that the women used to cry.  Always, always she was singing till\nthe time when my father became a rebel.  Then she used to cry too; and\nshe would sing no more; and when my father was put against a wall to be\nshot, and fell in the dust when the rifles rang out, she came at the\nmoment, and seeing him lying there, she threw up her hands, and fell down\nbeside him dead–”",
        "“The poor little senora, dead too–”",
        "“Not dead too–that was the pity of it.  You see my father was not dead.\nThe officer\"–she did not say sergeant–\"who commanded the firing squad,\nhe was what is called a compadre of my father–”",
        "“Yes, I understand–a made-brother, sealed with an oath, which binds\ncloser than a blood-brother.  It is that, is it not?”",
        "“So–like that.  Well, the compadre had put blank cartridges in their\nrifles, and my father pretended to fall dead; and the soldiers were\nmarched away; and my father, with my mother, was carried to his home,\nstill pretending to be dead.  It had been all arranged except the awful\nthing, my mother’s death.  Who could foresee that?  She ought to have\nbeen told; but who could guess that she would hear of it all, and come\nat the moment like that?  So, that was the way she went, and I was left\nalone with my father.”  She had told the truth in all, except in\nconveying that her mother was not of the lower orders, and that she went\nto the river to wash her spaniel and her pony instead of her clothes.",
        "“Your father–did they not arrest him again?  Did they not know?”",
        "She shrugged her shoulders.  That is not the way in Spain.  He was shot,\nas the orders were, with his back to the wall by a squad of soldiers with\nregulation bullets.  If he chose to come to life again, that was his own\naffair.  The Government would take no notice of him after he was dead.\nHe could bury himself, or he could come alive–it was all the same to\nthem.  So he came alive again.”",
        "“That is a story which would make a man’s name if he wrote it down,\"\nsaid Jean Jacques eloquently.  “And the poor little senora, but my heart\nbleeds for her!  To go like that in such pain, and not to know–If she\nhad been my wife I think I would have gone after her to tell her it was\nall right, and to be with her–”",
        "He paused confused, for that seemed like a reflection on her father’s\nchivalry, and for a man who had risked his life for his banished king–\nwhat would he have thought if he had been told that Sebastian Dolores was\nan anarchist who loathed kings!–it was an insult to suggest that he did\nnot know the right thing to do, or, knowing, had not done it.",
        "She saw the weakness of his case at once.  “There was his duty to the\nliving,” she said indignantly.",
        "“Ah, forgive me–what a fool I am!” Jean Jacques said repentantly at\nonce.  “There was his little girl, his beloved child, his Carmen Dolores,\nso beautiful, with the voice like a flute, and–”",
        "He drew nearer to her, his hand was outstretched to take hers; his eyes\nwere full of the passion of the moment; pity was drowning all caution,\nall the Norman shrewdness in him, when the Antoine suddenly stopped\nalmost dead with a sudden jolt and shock, then plunged sideways, jerked,\nand trembled.",
        "“We’ve struck a sunk iceberg–the rest of the story to-morrow, Senorita,\"\nhe cried, as they both sprang to their feet.",
        "“The rest of the story to-morrow,” she repeated, angry at the stroke of\nfate which had so interrupted the course of her fortune.  She said it\nwith a voice also charged with fear; for she was by nature a landfarer,\nnot a sea-farer, though on the rivers of Spain she had lived almost as\nmuch as on land, and she was a good swimmer.",
        "“The rest to-morrow,” she repeated, controlling herself.",
        "The rest came to-morrow.  When the Antoine struck the sunken iceberg she\nwas not more than one hundred and twenty miles from the coast of Gaspe.\nShe had not struck it full on, or she would have crumpled up, but had\nstruck and glanced, mounting the berg, and sliding away with a small\ngaping wound in her side, broken internally where she had been weakest.\nHer condition was one of extreme danger, and the captain was by no means\nsure that he could make the land.  If a storm or a heavy sea came on,\nthey were doomed.",
        "As it was, with all hands at the pumps the water gained on her, and she\nmoaned and creaked and ached her way into the night with no surety that\nshe would show a funnel to the light of another day.  Passengers and crew\nalike worked, and the few boats were got ready to lower away when the\nworst should come to the worst.  Below, with the crew, the little\nmoneymaster of St. Saviour’s worked with an energy which had behind it\nsome generations of hardy qualities; and all the time he refused to be\ndowncast.  There was something in his nature or in his philosophy after\nall.  He had not much of a voice, but it was lusty and full of good\nfeeling; and when cursing began, when a sailor even dared to curse his\nbaptism–the crime of crimes to a Catholic mind–Jean Jacques began to\nsing a cheery song with which the habitants make vocal their labours or\ntheir playtimes:",
        "                   “A Saint-Malo, beau port de mer,\n                    Trois gros navir’s sont arrives,\n                    Trois gros navir’s sont arrives\n                    Charges d’avoin’, charges de ble.\n                    Charges d’avoin’, charges de ble:\n                    Trois dam’s s’en vont les marchander.”",
        "And so on through many verses, with a heartiness that was a good antidote\nto melancholy, even though it was no specific for a shipwreck.  It played\nits part, however; and when Jean Jacques finished it, he plunged into\nthat other outburst of the habitant’s gay spirits, ’Bal chez Boule’:",
        "              “Bal chez Boule, bal chez Boule,\n               The vespers o’er, we’ll away to that;\n               With our hearts so light, and our feet so gay,\n               We’ll dance to the tune of ’The Cardinal’s Hat’\n               The better the deed, the better the day\n               Bal chez Boule, bal chez Boule!”",
        "And while Jean Jacques worked “like a little French pony,” as they say in\nCanada of every man with the courage to do hard things in him, he did not\nstop to think that the scanty life-belts had all been taken, and that he\nwas a very poor swimmer indeed: for, as a child, he had been subject to\ncramp, and so had made the Beau Cheval River less his friend than would\nhave been useful now.",
        "He realized it, however, soon after daybreak, when, within a few hundred\nyards of the shores of Gaspe, to which the good Basque captain had been\nslowly driving the Antoine all night, there came the cry, “All\nhands on deck!” and “Lower the boats!” for the Antoine’s time had come,\nand within a hand-reach of shore almost she found the end of her rickety\nlife.  Not more than three-fourths of the passengers and crew were got\ninto the boats.  Jean Jacques was not one of these; but he saw Carmen\nDolores and her father safely bestowed, though in different boats.  To\nthe girl’s appeal to him to come he gave a nod of assent, and said he\nwould get in at the last moment; but this he did not do, pushing into the\nboat instead a crying lad of fifteen, who said he was afraid to die.",
        "So it was that Jean Jacques took to the water side by side with the\nBasque captain, when the Antoine groaned and shook, and then grew still,\nand presently, with some dignity, dipped her nose into the shallow sea\nand went down.",
        "“The rest of the story to-morrow,” Jean Jacques had said when the vessel\nstruck the iceberg the night before; and so it was.",
        "The boat in which Carmen had been placed was swamped not far from shore,\nbut she managed to lay hold of a piece of drifting wreckage, and began to\nfight steadily and easily landward.  Presently she was aware, however, of\na man struggling hard some little distance away to the left of her, and\nfrom the tousled hair shaking in the water she was sure that it was Jean\nJacques.",
        "So it proved to be; and thus it was that, at his last gasp almost, when\nhe felt he could keep up no longer, the wooden seat to which Carmen clung\ncame to his hand, and a word of cheer from her drew his head up with what\nwas almost a laugh.",
        "“To think of this!” he said presently when he was safe, with her\nswimming beside him without support, for the wooden seat would not\nsustain the weight of two.  “To think that it is you who saves me!” he\nagain declared eloquently, as they made the shore in comparative ease,\nfor she was a fine swimmer.",
        "“It is the rest of the story,” he said with great cheerfulness and aplomb\nas they stood on the shore in the morning sun, shoeless, coatless, but\nsafe: and she understood.",
        "There was nothing else for him to do.  The usual process of romance had\nbeen reversed.  He had not saved her life, she had saved his.  The least\nthat he could do was to give her shelter at the Manor Cartier yonder at\nSt. Saviour’s, her and, if need be, her father.  Human gratitude must\nhave play.  It was so strong in this case that it alone could have\novercome the Norman caution of Jean Jacques, and all his worldly wisdom\n(so much in his own eyes).  Added thereto was the thing which had been\ngreatly stirred in him at the instant the Antoine struck; and now he kept\npicturing Carmen in the big living-room and the big bedroom of the house\nby the mill, where was the comfortable four-poster which had come from\nthe mansion of the last Baron of Beaugard down by St. Laurent.",
        "Three days after the shipwreck of the Antoine, and as soon as sufficient\nfinery could be got in Quebec, it was accomplished, the fate of Jean\nJacques.  How proud he was to open his cheque-book before the young\nSpanish maid, and write in cramped, characteristic hand a cheque for a\nhundred dollars or so at a time!  A moiety of this money was given to\nSebastian Dolores, who could scarcely believe his good fortune.  A\nsituation was got for him by the help of a good abbe at Quebec, who was\ntouched by the tale of the wreck of the Antoine, and by the no less\nwonderful tale of the refugees of Spain, who naturally belonged to the\ntrue faith which “feared God and honoured the King.”  Sebastian Dolores\nwas grateful for the post offered him, though he would rather have gone\nto St. Saviour’s with his daughter, for he had lost the gift of work, and\nhe desired peace after war.  In other words, he had that fatal trait of\nthose who strive to make the world better by talk and violence, the vice\nof indolence.",
        "But when Jean Jacques and his handsome bride started for St. Saviour’s,\nthe new father-in-law did not despair of following soon.  He would\ngreatly have enjoyed the festivities which, after all, did follow the\nhome-coming of Jean Jacques Barbille and his Spanische; for while they\nlacked enthusiasm because Carmen was a foreigner, the romance of the\nstory gave the whole proceedings a spirit and interest which spread into\nadjoining parishes: so that people came to mass from forty miles away to\nsee the pair who had been saved from the sea.",
        "And when the Quebec newspapers found their way into the parish, with a\nthrilling account of the last hours of the Antoine; and of Jean Jacques’\nchivalrous act in refusing to enter a boat to save himself, though he was\nsuch a bad swimmer and was in danger of cramp; and how he sang Bal chez\nBoule while the men worked at the pumps; they permitted the apres noces\nof M’sieu’ and Madame Jean Jacques Barbille to be as brilliant as could\nbe, with the help of lively improvisation.  Even speech-making occurred\nagain in an address of welcome some days later.  This was followed by a\nfeast of Spanish cakes and meats made by the hands of Carmen Dolores,\n\"the lady saved from the sea\"–as they called her; not knowing that she\nhad saved herself, and saved Jean Jacques as well.  It was not quite to\nJean Jacques’ credit that he did not set this error right, and tell the\nworld the whole exact truth.",
        "Air of certainty and universal comprehension\nAlways calling to something, for something outside ourselves\nCame of a race who set great store by mothers and grandmothers\nGrove of pines to give a sense of warmth in winter\nGrow more intense, more convinced, more thorough, as they talk\nHe admired, yet he wished to be admired\nInclined to resent his own insignificance\nLyrical in his enthusiasms\nNo man so simply sincere, or so extraordinarily prejudiced\nOf those who hypnotize themselves, who glow with self-creation\nSpurting out little geysers of other people’s cheap wisdom\nUntamed by the normal restraints of a happy married life",
        "It was hard to say which was the more important person in the parish, the\nNew Cure or M’sieu’ Jean Jacques Barbille.  When the Old Cure was alive\nJean Jacques was a lesser light, and he accepted his degree of\nillumination with content.  But when Pere Langon was gathered to his\nfathers, and thousands had turned away from the graveyard, where he who\nhad baptised them, confirmed them, blessed them, comforted them, and\nfirmly led them was laid to rest, they did not turn at once to his\nsuccessor with confidence and affection.  The new cure, M. Savry, was\nyoung; the Old Cure had lived to be eighty-five, bearing wherever he went\na lamp of wisdom at which the people lighted their small souls.  The New\nCure could command their obedience, but he could not command their love\nand confidence until he had earned them.",
        "So it was that, for a time, Jean Jacques took the place of the Old Cure\nin the human side of the life of the district, though in a vastly lesser\ndegree.  Up to the death of M. Langon, Jean Jacques had done very well\nin life, as things go in out-of-the-way places of the world.  His mill,\nwhich ground good flour, brought him increasing pence; his saw-mill more\nthan paid its way; his farms made a small profit, in spite of a cousin\nwho worked one on halves, but who had a spendthrift wife; the ash-factory\nwhich his own initiative had started made no money, but the loss was only\nsmall; and he had even made profit out of his lime-kilns, although\nSebastian Dolores, Carmen’s father, had at one time mismanaged them–but\nof that anon.  Jean Jacques himself managed the business of money-lending\nand horse-dealing; and he also was agent for fire insurance and a dealer\nin lightning rods.",
        "In the thirteen years since he married he had been able to keep a good\nmany irons in the fire, and also keep them more or less hot.  Many people\nin his and neighbouring parishes were indebted to him, and it was worth\ntheir while to stand well with him.  If he insisted on debts being paid,\nhe was never exacting or cruel.  If he lent money, he never demanded more\nthan eight per cent.; and he never pressed his debtors unduly.  His\ncheerfulness seldom deserted him, and he was notably kind to the poor.\nNot seldom in the winter time a poor man, here and there in the parish,\nwould find dumped down outside his door in the early morning a half-cord\nof wood or a bag of flour.",
        "It could not be said that Jean Jacques did not enjoy his own generosity.\nHis vanity, however, did not come from an increasing admiration of his\nown personal appearance, a weakness which often belongs to middle age;\nbut from the study of his so-called philosophy, which in time became an\nobsession with him.  In vain the occasional college professors, who spent\nsummer months at St. Saviour’s, sought to interest him in science and\nhistory, for his philosophy had large areas of boredom; but science\nmarched over too jagged a road for his tender intellectual feet; the\nwild places where it led dismayed him.  History also meant numberless\ndates and facts.  Perhaps he could have managed the dates, for he was\nquick at figures, but the facts were like bees in their hive,–he could\nscarcely tell one from another by looking at them.",
        "So it was that Jean Jacques kept turning his eyes, as he thought, to the\neverlasting meaning of things, to “the laws of Life and the decrees of\nDestiny.”  He was one of those who had found, as he thought, what he\ncould do, and was sensible enough to do it.  Let the poor fellows, who\ngave themselves to science, trouble their twisted minds with trigonometry\nand the formula of some grotesque chemical combination; let the dull\npeople rub their noses in the ink of Greek and Latin, which was no use\nfor everyday consumption; let the heads of historians ache with the\nwarring facts of the lives of nations; it all made for sleep.  But\nphilosophy–ah, there was a field where a man could always use knowledge\ngot from books or sorted out of his own experiences!",
        "It happened, therefore, that Jean Jacques, who not too vaguely realized\nthat there was reputation to be got from being thought a philosopher,\nalways carried about with him his little compendium from the quay at\nQuebec, which he had brought ashore inside his redflannel shirt, with the\nantique silver watch, when the Antoine went down.",
        "Thus also it was that when a lawyer in court at Vilray, four miles from\nSt. Saviour’s, asked him one day, when he stepped into the witness-box,\nwhat he was, meaning what was his occupation, his reply was, “Moi-je suis\nM’sieu’ Jean Jacques, philosophe–(Me–I am M’sieu’ Jean Jacques,\nphilosopher).”",
        "A little later outside the court-house, the Judge who had tried the case\n–M. Carcasson–said to the Clerk of the Court:",
        "“A curious, interesting little man, that Monsieur Jean Jacques.  What’s\nhis history?”",
        "“A character, a character, monsieur le juge,” was the reply of M. Amand\nFille.  “His family has been here since Frontenac’s time.  He is a figure\nin the district, with a hand in everything.  He does enough foolish\nthings to ruin any man, yet swims along–swims along.  He has many kinds\nof business–mills, stores, farms, lime-kilns, and all that, and keeps\nthem all going; and as if he hadn’t enough to do, and wasn’t risking\nenough, he’s now organizing a cheese-factory on the co-operative\nprinciple, as in Upper Canada among the English.”",
        "“He has a touch of originality, that’s sure,” was the reply of the Judge.",
        "The Clerk of the Court nodded and sighed.  “Monseigneur Giron of Laval,\nthe greatest scholar in Quebec, he said to me once that M’sieu’ Jean\nJacques missed being a genius by an inch.  But, monsieur le juge, not to\nhave that inch is worse than to be an ignoramus.”",
        "Judge Carcasson nodded.  “Ah, surely!  Your Jean Jacques lacks a balance-\nwheel.  He has brains, but not enough.  He has vision, but it is not\nsteady; he has argument, but it breaks down just where it should be most\ncohesive.  He interested me.  I took note of every turn of his mind as he\ngave evidence.  He will go on for a time, pulling his strings, doing this\nand doing that, and then, all at once, when he has got a train of\ncomplications, his brain will not be big enough to see the way out.  Tell\nme, has he a balance-wheel in his home–a sensible wife, perhaps?”",
        "The Clerk of the Court shook his head mournfully and seemed to hesitate.\nThen he said, “Comme ci, comme ca–but no, I will speak the truth about\nit.  She is a Spaniard–the Spanische she is called by the neighbours.\nI will tell you all about that, and you will wonder that he has carried\non as well as he has, with his vanity and his philosophy.”",
        "“He’ll have need of his philosophy before he’s done, or I don’t know\nhuman nature; he’ll get a bad fall one of these days,” responded the\nJudge.  “’Moi-je suis M’sieu’ Jean Jacques, philosophe’–that is what he\nsaid.  Bumptious little man, and yet–and yet there’s something in him.\nThere’s a sense of things which everyone doesn’t have–a glimmer of life\nbeyond his own orbit, a catching at the biggest elements of being,\na hovering on the confines of deep understanding, as it were.  Somehow\nI feel almost sorry for him, though he annoyed me while he was in the\nwitness-box, in spite of myself.  He was as the English say, so ’damn\nsure.’”",
        "“So damn sure always,” agreed the Clerk of the Court, with a sense of\npleasure that his great man, this wonderful aged little judge, should\nhave shown himself so human as to use such a phrase.",
        "“But, no doubt, the sureness has been a good servant in his business,\"\nreturned the Judge.  “Confidence in a weak world gets unearned profit\noften.  But tell me about his wife–the Spanische.  Tell me the how and\nwhy, and everything.  I’d like to trace our little money-man wise to his\nsource.”",
        "Again M. Fille was sensibly agitated.  “She is handsome, and she has\ngreat, good gifts when she likes to use them,” he answered.  “She can do\nas much in an hour as most women can do in two; but then she will not\nkeep at it.  Her life is but fits and starts.  Yet she has a good head\nfor business, yes, very good.  She can see through things.  Still, there\nit is–she will not hold fast from day to day.”",
        "“Yes, yes, but where did she come from?  What was the field where she\ngrew?”",
        "“To be sure, monsieur.  It was like this,” responded the other.",
        "Thereupon M. Fille proceeded to tell the history, musical with legend,\nof Jean Jacques’ Grand Tour, of the wreck of the Antoine, of the marriage\nof the “seigneur,” the home-coming, and the life that followed, so far as\nrumour, observation, and a mind with a gift for narrative, which was not\nto be incomplete for lack of imagination, could make it.  It was only\nwhen he offered his own reflections on Carmen Dolores, now Carmen\nBarbille, and on women generally, that Judge Carcasson pulled him up.",
        "“So, so, I see.  She has temperament and so on, but she’s unsteady,\nand regarded by her neighbours not quite as one that belongs.  Bah,\nthe conceit of every race!  They are all the same.  The English are the\nworst–as though the good God was English.  But the child–so beautiful,\nyou say, and yet more like the father than the mother.  He is not\nhandsome, that Jean Jacques, but I can understand that the little one\nshould be like him and yet beautiful too.  I should like to see the\nchild.”",
        "Suddenly the Clerk of the Court stopped and touched the arm of his\ndistinguished friend and patron.  “That is very easy, monsieur,\"\nhe said eagerly, “for there she is in the red wagon yonder, waiting for\nher father.  She adores him, and that makes trouble sometimes.  Then the\nmother gets fits, and makes things hard at the Manor Cartier.  It is not\nall a bed of roses for our Jean Jacques.  But there it is.  He is very\nbusy all the time.  Something doing always, never still, except when you\nwill find him by the road-side, or in a tavern with all the people round\nhim, talking, jesting, and he himself going into a trance with his book\nof philosophy.  It is very strange that everlasting going, going, going,\nand yet that love of his book.  I sometimes think it is all pretence, and\nthat he is all vanity–or almost so.  Heaven forgive me for my want of\ncharity!”",
        "The little round judge cocked his head astutely.  “But you say he is kind\nto the poor, that he does not treat men hardly who are in debt to him,\nand that he will take his coat off his back to give to a tramp–is it\nso?”",
        "“As so, as so, monsieur.”",
        "“Then he is not all vanity, and because of that he will feel the blow\nwhen it comes–alas, so much he will feel it!”",
        "“What blow, monsieur le juge?–but ah, look, monsieur!”  He pointed\neagerly.  “There she is, going to the red wagon–Madame Jean Jacques.\nIs she not a figure of a woman?  See the walk of her–is it not\ndistinguished?  She is half a hand-breadth taller than Jean Jacques.  And\nher face, most sure it is a face to see.  If Jean Jacques was not so busy\nwith his farms and his mills and his kilns and his usury, he would see\nwhat a woman he has got.  It is his good fortune that she has such sense\nin business.  When Jean Jacques listens to her, he goes right.  She\nherself did not want her father to manage the lime-kilns–the old\nSebastian Dolores.  She was for him staying at Mirimachi, where he kept\nthe books of the lumber firm.  But no, Jean Jacques said that he could\nmake her happy by having her father near her, and he would not believe\nshe meant what she said.  He does not understand her; that is the\ntrouble.  He knows as much of women or men as I know of–”",
        "“Of the law–hein?” laughed the great man.",
        "“Monsieur–ah, that is your little joke!  I laugh, yes, but I laugh,\"\nresponded the Clerk of the Court a little uncertainly.  “Now once when\nshe told him that the lime-kilns–”",
        "The Judge, who had retraced his steps down the street of the town–it was\nlittle more than a large village, but because it had a court-house and a\nmarketplace it was called a town–that he might have a good look at\nMadame Jean Jacques and her child before he passed them, suddenly said:",
        "“How is it you know so much about it all, Maitre Fille–as to what she\nsays and of the inner secrets of the household?  Ah, ha, my little\nLothario, I have caught you–a bachelor too, with time on his hands,\nand the right side of seventy as well!  The evidence you have given of a\nclose knowledge of the household of our Jean Jacques does not have its\nbasis in hearsay, but in acute personal observation.  Tut-tut!  Fie-fie!\nmy little gay Clerk of the Court.  Fie!  Fie!”",
        "M. Fille was greatly disconcerted.  He had never been a Lothario.\nIn forty years he had never had an episode with one of “the other sex,\"\nbut it was not because he was impervious to the softer emotions.  An\nintolerable shyness had ever possessed him when in the presence of women,\nand even small girl children had frightened him, till he had made friends\nwith little Zoe Barbille, the daughter of Jean Jacques.  Yet even with\nZoe, who was so simple and companionable and the very soul of childish\nconfidence, he used to blush and falter till she made him talk.  Then he\nbecame composed, and his tongue was like a running stream, and on that\nstream any craft could sail.  On it he became at ease with madame the\nSpanische, and he even went so far as to look her full in the eyes on\nmore than one occasion.",
        "“Answer me–ah, you cannot answer!” teasingly added the Judge, who loved\nhis Clerk of the Court, and had great amusement out of his discomfiture.\n\"You are convicted.  At an age when a man should be settling down, you\nare gallivanting with the wife of a philosopher.”",
        "“Monsieur–monsieur le juge!” protested M. Fille with slowly heightening\ncolour.  “I am innocent, yes, altogether.  There is nothing, believe me.\nIt is the child, the little Zoe–but a maid of charm and kindness.  She\nbrings me cakes and the toffy made by her own hands; and if I go to the\nManor Cartier, as I often do, it is to be polite and neighbourly.  If\nMadame says things to me, and if I see what I see, and hear what I hear,\nit is no crime; it is no misdemeanour; it is within the law–the perfect\nlaw.”",
        "Suddenly the Judge linked his arm within that of the other, for he also\nwas little, and he was fat and round and ruddy, and even smaller than M.\nFille, who was thin, angular and pale.",
        "“Ah, my little Confucius,” he said gently, “have you seen and heard me so\nseldom that you do not know me yet, or what I really think?  Of course it\nis within the law–the perfect law–to visit at m’sieu’ the philosopher’s\nhouse and talk at length also to m’sieu’ the philosopher’s wife; while to\nmake the position regular by friendship with the philosopher’s child is a\nwisdom which I can only ascribe to\"–his voice was charged with humour\nand malicious badinage “to an extended acquaintance with the devices of\nhuman nature, as seen in those episodes of the courts with which you have\nbeen long familiar.”",
        "“Oh, monsieur, dear monsieur!” protested the Clerk of the Court, “you\nalways make me your butt.”",
        "“My friend,” said the Judge, squeezing his arm, “if I could have you no\nother way, I would make you my butler!”",
        "Then they both laughed at the inexpensive joke, and the Clerk of the\nCourt was in high spirits, for on either side of the street were people\nwith whom he lived every day, and they could see the doyen of the Bench,\nthe great Judge Carcasson, who had refused to be knighted, arm in arm\nwith him.  Aye, and better than all, and more than all, here was Zoe\nBarbille drawing her mother’s attention to him almost in the embrace of\nthe magnificent jurist.",
        "The Judge, with his small, round, quizzical eyes which missed nothing,\nsaw too; and his attention was strangely arrested by the faces of both\nthe mother and the child.  His first glance at the woman’s face made him\nflash an inward light on the memory of Jean Jacques’ face in the witness-\nbox, and a look of reflective irony came into his own.  The face of\nCarmen Dolores, wife of the philosophic miller and money-master, did not\nbelong to the world where she was placed–not because she was so unlike\nthe habitant women, or even the wives of the big farmers, or the sister\nof the Cure, or the ladies of the military and commercial exiles who\nlived in that portion of the province; but because of an alien something\nin her look–a lonely, distant sense of isolation, a something which\nmight hide a companionship and sympathy of a rare kind, or might be but\nthe mask of a furtive, soulless nature.  In the child’s face was nothing\nof this.  It was open as the day, bright with the cheerfulness of her\nfather’s countenance, alive with a humour which that countenance did not\npossess.  The contour was like that of Jean Jacques, but with a fineness\nand delicacy to its fulness absent from his own; and her eyes were a deep\nand lustrous brown, under a forehead which had a boldness of gentle\ndignity possessed by neither father nor mother.  Her hair was thick,\nbrown and very full, like that of her father, and in all respects, save\none, she had an advantage over both her parents.  Her mouth had a\nsweetness which might not unfairly be called weakness, though that was\nbalanced by a chin of commendable strength.",
        "But the Judge’s eyes found at once this vulnerable point in her character\nas he had found that of her mother.  Delightful the child was, and alert\nand companionable, with no remarkable gifts, but with a rare charm and\nsympathy.  Her face was the mirror of her mind, and it had no ulterior\nthought.  Her mother’s face, the Judge had noted, was the foreground of a\nlandscape which had lonely shadows.  It was a face of some distinction\nand suited to surroundings more notable, though the rural life Carmen had\nled since the Antoine went down and her fortunes came up, had coarsened\nher beauty a very little.",
        "“There’s something stirring in the coverts,” said the Judge to himself as\nhe was introduced to the mother and child.  By a hasty gesture Zoe gave a\ncommand to M. Fille to help her down.  With a hand on his shoulder she\ndropped to the ground.  Her object was at once apparent.  She made a\npretty old-fashioned curtsey to the Judge, then held out her hand, as\nthough to reassert her democratic equality.",
        "As the Judge looked at Madame Barbille, he was involuntarily, but none\nthe less industriously, noting her characteristics; and the sum of his\nreflections, after a few moments’ talk, was that dangers he had seen\nahead of Jean Jacques, would not be averted by his wife, indeed might\neasily have their origin in her.",
        "“I wonder it has gone on as long as it has,” he said to himself; though\nit seemed unreasonable that his few moments with her, and the story told\nhim by the Clerk of the Court, should enable him to come to any definite\nconclusion.  But at eighty-odd Judge Carcasson was a Solon and a Solomon\nin one.  He had seen life from all angles, and he was not prepared to\ngive any virtue or the possession of any virtue too much rope; while\nnothing in life surprised him.",
        "“How would you like to be a judge?” he asked of Zoe, suddenly taking her\nhand in his.  A kinship had been at once established between them, so\nlittle has age, position, and intellect to do with the natural\ngravitations of human nature.",
        "She did not answer direct, and that pleased him.  “If I were a judge I\nshould have no jails,” she said.  “What would you do with the bad\npeople?” he asked.",
        "“I would put them alone on a desert island, or out at sea in a little\nboat, or out on the prairies without a horse, so that they’d have to work\nfor their lives.”",
        "“Oh, I see!  If M. Fille here set fire to a house, you would drop him on\nthe prairie far away from everything and everybody and let him ’root hog\nor die’?”",
        "“Don’t you think it would kill him or cure him?” she asked whimsically.",
        "The Judge laughed, his eyes twinkling.  “That’s what they did when the\nworld was young, dear ma’m’selle.  There was no time to build jails.\nAlone on the prairie–a separate prairie for every criminal–that would\ntake a lot of space; but the idea is all right.  It mightn’t provide the\nproper degree of punishment, however.  But that is being too particular.\nAlone on the prairie for punishment–well, I should like to see it\ntried.”",
        "He remembered that saying of his long after, while yet he was alive,\nand a tale came to him from the prairies which made his eyes turn\nmore intently towards a land that is far off, where the miserable\nmiscalculations and mistakes of this world are readjusted.  Now he was\nonly conscious of a primitive imagination looking out of a young girl’s\nface, and making a bridge between her understanding and his own.",
        "“What else would you do if you were a judge?” he asked presently.",
        "“I would make my father be a miller,” she replied.  “But he is a miller,\nI hear.”",
        "“But he is so many other things–so many.  If he was only a miller we\nshould have more of him.  He is at home only a little.  If I get up early\nenough in the morning, or if I am let stay up at night late enough, I see\nhim; but that is not enough–is it, mother?” she added with a sudden\nsense that she had gone too far, that she ought not to say this perhaps.",
        "The woman’s face had darkened for an instant, and irritation showed in\nher eyes, but by an effort of the will she controlled herself.",
        "“Your father knows best what he can do and can’t do,” she said evenly.",
        "“But you would not let a man judge for himself, would you, ma’m’selle?\"\nasked the old inquisitor.  “You would judge for the man what was best for\nhim to do?”",
        "“I would judge for my father,” she replied.  “He is too good a man to\njudge for himself.”",
        "“Well, there’s a lot of sense in that, ma’m’selle philosophe,” answered\nJudge Carcasson.  “You would make the good idle, and make the bad work.\nThe good you would put in a mill to watch the stones grind, and the bad\nyou would put on a prairie alone to make the grist for the grinding.\nMa’m’selle, we must be friends–is it not so?”",
        "“Haven’t we always been friends?” the young girl asked with the look of\na visionary suddenly springing up in her eyes.",
        "Here was temperament indeed.  She pleased Judge Carcasson greatly.  “But\nyes, always, and always, and always,” he replied.  Inwardly he said to\nhimself, “I did not see that at first.  It is her father in her.",
        "“Zoe!” said her mother reprovingly.",
        "A moment afterwards the Judge, as he walked down the street still arm in\narm with the Clerk of the Court, said: “That child must have good luck,\nor she will not have her share of happiness.  She has depths that are not\ndeep enough.”  Presently he added, “Tell me, my Clerk, the man–Jean\nJacques–he is so much away–has there never been any talk about–about.”",
        "“About–monsieur le juge?” asked M. Fille rather stiffly.  “For instance\n–about what?”",
        "“For instance, about a man–not Jean Jacques.”",
        "The lips of the Clerk of the Court tightened.  “Never at any time–till\nnow, monsieur le juge.”",
        "“Ah–till now!”",
        "The Clerk of the Court blushed.  What he was about to say was difficult,\nbut he alone of all the world guessed at the tragedy which was hovering\nover Jean Jacques’ home.  By chance he had seen something on an afternoon\nof three days before, and he had fled from it as a child would fly from a\ndemon.  He was a purist at law, but he was a purist in life also, and not\nbecause the flush of youth had gone and his feet were on the path which\nleads into the autumn of a man’s days.  The thing he had seen had been\nterribly on his mind, and he had felt that his own judgment was not\nsufficient for the situation, that he ought to tell someone.",
        "The Cure was the only person who had come to his mind when he became\ntroubled to the point of actual mental agony.  But the new curb,\nM. Savry, was not like the Old Cure, and, besides, was it not stepping\nbetween the woman and her confessional?  Yet he felt that something ought\nto be done.  It never occurred to him to speak to Jean Jacques.  That\nwould have seemed so brutal to the woman.  It came to him to speak to\nCarmen, but he knew that he dared not do so.  He could not say to a\nwoman that which must shame her before him, she who had kept her head\nso arrogantly high–not so much to him, however, as to the rest of the\nworld.  He had not the courage; and yet he had fear lest some awful thing\nwould at any moment now befall the Manor Cartier.  If it did, he would\nfeel himself to blame had he done nothing to stay the peril.  So far he\nwas the only person who could do so, for he was the only person who knew!",
        "The Judge could feel his friend’s arm tremble with emotion, and he said:\n\"Come, now, my Plato, what is it?  A man has come to disturb the peace of\nJean Jacques, our philosophe, eh?”",
        "“That is it, monsieur–a man of a kind.”",
        "“Oh, of course, my bambino, of course, a man ’of a kind,’ or there would\nbe no peace disturbed.  You want to tell me, I see.  Proceed then; there\nis no reason why you should not.  I am secret.  I have seen much.  I have\nno prejudices.  As you will, however; but I can see it would relieve your\nmind to tell me.  In truth I felt there was something when I saw you look\nat her first, when you spoke to her, when she talked with me.  She is a\nfine figure of a woman, and Jean Jacques, as you say, is much away from\nhome.  In fact he neglects her–is it not so?”",
        "“He means it not, but it is so.  His life is full of–”",
        "“Yes, yes, of stores and ash-factories and debtors and lightning-rods and\nlime-kilns, and mortgaged farms, and the price of wheat–but certainly,\nI understand it all, my Fille.  She is too much alone, and if she has\ntravelled by the compass all these thirteen years without losing the\ntrack, it is something to the credit of human nature.”",
        "“Ah, monsieur, a vow before the good God–!”  The Judge interrupted\nsharply.  “Tut, tut–these vows!  Do you not know that a vow may be a\nthing that ruins past redemption?  A vow is sacred.  Well, a poor mortal\nin one moment of weakness breaks it.  Then there is a sense of awful\nshame of being lost, of never being able to put right the breaking of the\nvow, though the rest can be put right by sorrow and repentance!  I would\nhave no vows.  They haunt like ghosts when they are broken, they torture\nlike fire then.  Don’t talk to me of vows.  It is not vows that keep the\nworld right, but the prayer of a man’s soul from day to day.”",
        "The Judge’s words sounded almost blasphemous to M. Fille.  A vow not\nkeep the world right!  Then why the vows of the Church at baptism,\nat confirmation, at marriage?  Why the vows of the priests, of the nuns,\nof those who had given themselves to eternal service?  Monsieur had\nspoken terrible things.  And yet he had said at the last: “It is not vows\nthat keep the world right, but the prayer of a man’s soul from day to\nday.”  That was not heretical, or atheistic, or blasphemous.  It sounded\nlogical and true and good.",
        "He was about to say that, to some people, vows were the only way of\nkeeping them to their duty–and especially women–but the Judge added\ngently: “I would not for the world hurt your sensibilities, my little\nClerk, and we are not nearly so far apart as you think at the minute.\nThank God, I keep the faith that is behind all faith–the speech of a\nman’s soul with God.  .  .  .  But there, if you can, let us hear what\nman it is who disturbs the home of the philosopher.  It is not my Fille,\nthat’s sure.”",
        "He could not resist teasing, this judge who had a mind of the most rare\nuprightness; and he was not always sorry when his teasing hurt; for, to\nhis mind, men should be lashed into strength, when they drooped over the\ntasks of life; and what so sharp a lash as ridicule or satire!",
        "“Proceed, my friend,” he urged brusquely, not waiting for the gasp of\npained surprise of the little Clerk to end.  He was glad to see the\nfigure beside him presently straighten itself, as though to be braced for\na task of difficulty.  Indignation and resentment were good things to\nstiffen a man’s back.",
        "“It was three days ago,” said M. Fille.  “I saw it with my own eyes.\nI had come to the Manor Cartier by the road, down the hill–Mont Violet–\nbehind the house.  I could see into the windows of the house.  There was\nno reason why I should not see–there never has been a reason,” he added,\nas though to justify himself.",
        "“Of course, of course, my friend.  One’s eyes are open, and one sees what\none sees, without looking for it.  Proceed.”",
        "“As I looked down I saw Madame with a man’s arms round her, and his lips\nto hers.  It was not Jean Jacques.”",
        "“Of course, of course.  Proceed.  What did you do?”",
        "“I stopped.  I fell back–”",
        "“Of course.  Behind a tree?”",
        "“Behind some elderberry bushes.”",
        "“Of course.  Elderberry bushes–that’s better than a tree.  I am very\nfond of elderberry wine when it is new.  Proceed.”",
        "The Clerk of the Court shrank.  What did it matter whether or no the\nJudge liked elderberry wine, when the world was falling down for Jean\nJacques and his Zoe–and his wife.  But with a sigh he continued: “There\nis nothing more.  I stayed there for awhile, and then crept up the hill\nagain, and came back to my home and locked myself in.”",
        "“What had you done that you should lock yourself in?”",
        "“Ah, monsieur, how can I explain such things?  Perhaps I was ashamed that\nI had seen things I should not have seen.  I do not blush that I wept for\nthe child, who is–but you saw her, monsieur le juge.”",
        "“Yes, yes, the little Zoe, and the little philosopher.  Proceed.”",
        "“What more is there to tell!”",
        "“A trifle perhaps, as you will think,” remarked the Judge ironically, but\nas one who, finding a crime, must needs find the criminal too.  “I must\nask you to inform the Court who was the too polite friend of Madame.”",
        "“Monsieur, pardon me.  I forgot.  It is essential, of course.  You must\nknow that there is a flume, a great wooden channel–”",
        "“Yes, yes.  I comprehend.  Once I had a case of a flume.  It was fifteen\nfeet deep and it let in the water of the river to the mill-wheels.  A\nflume regulates, concentrates, and controls the water power.  I\ncomprehend perfectly.  Well?”",
        "“So.  This flume for Jean Jacques’ mill was also fifteen feet deep or\nmore.  It was out of repair, and Jean Jacques called in a master-\ncarpenter from Laplatte, Masson by name–George Masson–to put the flume\nright.”",
        "“How long ago was that?”",
        "“A month ago.  But Masson was not here all the time.  It was his workmen\nwho did the repairs, but he came over to see–to superintend.  At first\nhe came twice in the week.  Then he came every day.”",
        "“Ah, then he came every day!  How do you know that?”",
        "“It was my custom to walk to the mill every day–to watch the work on the\nflume.  It was only four miles away across the fields and through the\nwoods, making a walk of much charm–especially in the autumn, when the\ncolours of the foliage are so fine, and the air has a touch of\npensiveness, so that one is induced to reflection.”",
        "There was the slightest tinge of impatience in the Judge’s response.\n\"Yes, yes, I understand.  You walked to study life and to reflect and to\nenjoy your intimacy with nature, but also to see our friend Zoe and her\nhome.  And I do not wonder.  She has a charm which makes me sad–\nfor her.”",
        "“So I have felt, so I have felt for her, monsieur.  When she is gayest,\nand when, as it might seem, I am quite happy, talking to her, or\npicnicking, or idling on the river, or helping her with her lessons,\nI have sadness, I know not why.”",
        "The Judge pressed his friend’s arm firmly.  His voice grew more\ninsistent.  “Now, Maitre Fille, I think I understand the story, but there\nare lacunee which you must fill.  You say the thing happened three days\nago–now, when will the work be finished?”",
        "“The work will be finished to-morrow, monsieur.  Only one workman is\nleft, and he will be quit of his task to-night.”",
        "“So the thing–the comedy or tragedy will come to an end to-morrow?\"\nremarked the Judge seriously.  “How did you find out that the workmen\ngo tomorrow, maitre?”",
        "“Jean Jacques–he told me yesterday.”",
        "“Then it all ends to-morrow,” responded the Judge.",
        "The puzzled subordinate stood almost still, and looked at the Judge in\nwonder.  Why should it all end to-morrow simply because the work was\nfinished at the flume?  At last he spoke.",
        "“It is only twelve miles to Laplatte where George Masson lives, and he\nhas, besides, another contract near here, but three miles from the Manor\nCartier.  Also besides, how can we know what she will do–Jean Jacques’\nwife.  How can we tell but that she will perhaps go and leave the beloved\nZoe alone!”",
        "“And leave our little philosopher–miller also alone?” remarked the\nJudge quizzically, yet with solemnity.  M. Fille was agitated; he made\na protesting gesture.  “Jean Jacques can find comfort, but the child–ah,\nno, it is too terrible!  Someone should speak.  I tried to do it–to\nMadame Carmen, to Jean Jacques; but it was no use.  How could I betray\nher to him, how could I tell her that I knew her shame!”",
        "The Judge turned brusquely and caught his friend by the shoulders,\nfastening him with the eyes which had made many a witness forget to lie.",
        "“If you were an avocat in practice I would ruin your reputation, Fille,\"\nhe said.  “A fool would tell Jean Jacques, or speak to the woman, and\nspoil all; for women go mad when they are in danger, and they do the\nimpossible things.  But did it not occur to you that the one person to\nhave in a quiet room with the doors shut, with the light of the sun in\nhis face, with the book of the law open on your desk and the damages to\nbe got by an injured husband, in a Catholic province with a Catholic\nJudge, written down on a piece of paper, to hand over at the right\nmoment–did it not strike you that that person was your George Masson?”",
        "M. Fille’s head dropped before the disdainful eyes of M. Carcasson.  He\nwho prided himself in keeping the court right on points of procedure, who\nwas looked upon almost with the respect given the position of the Judge\nhimself, that he should fail in thinking of the obvious thing was\nhumiliating, and alas! so disconcerting.",
        "“I am a fool, an imbecile,” he responded, in great dejection.",
        "“This much must be said, my imbecile, that every man some time or other\nmakes just such a fool of his intelligence,” was the soft reply.",
        "A thin hand made a gesture of dissent.  “Not you, monsieur.  Never!”",
        "“If it is any comfort to you, know then, my Solon, that I have done so\npublicly in my time, while you have only done it privately.  But let us\nsee.  That Masson must be struck of a heap.  What sort of a man is he to\nlook at?  Apart from his morals, what class of creature is he?”",
        "“He is a man of strength, of force in his way, monsieur.  He made himself\nfrom an apprentice without a cent, and he has now thirty men at work.”",
        "“Then he does not drink or gamble?”",
        "“Neither, monsieur.”",
        "“Has he a family?”",
        "“No, monsieur.”",
        "“How old is he?”",
        "“Forty or thereabouts, monsieur.”",
        "The Judge cogitated for a moment, then said: “Ah, that’s bad–unmarried\nand forty, and no vices except this.  It gives him few escape-valves.  Is\nhe good-looking?  What is his appearance?”",
        "“Nor short, nor tall, and square shoulders.  His face like the yellow\nbrown of a peach, hair that curls close to his head, blue eyes that see\neverything, and a big hand that knows what it is doing.”",
        "The Judge nodded.  “Ah, you have watched him, maitre.  .  .  .  When?\nSince then?”",
        "“No, no, monsieur, not since.  If I had watched him since, I should\nperhaps have thought of the right thing to do.  But I did not.  I used to\nstudy him while the work was going on, when he first came, but I have\nknown him some time from a distance.  If a man makes himself what he is,\nyou look at him, of course.”",
        "“Truly.  His temper–his disposition, what is it?”  M. Fille was very\nmuch alive now.  He replied briskly.  “Like the snap of a whip.  He flies\ninto anger and flies out.  He has a laugh that makes men say, ’How he\nenjoys himself !’ and his mind is very quick and sure.”",
        "The Judge nodded with satisfaction.  “Well done!  Well done!  I have got\nhim in my eye.  He will not be so easy to handle; but, if he has brains,\nhe will see that you have the right end of the stick; and he will kiss\nand ride away.  It will not be easy, but the game is in your hands, my\nFille.  In a quiet room, with the book of the law open, and figures of\ndamages given by a Catholic court and Judge–I think that will do it; and\nthen the course of true philosophy will not long be interrupted in the\nhouse of Jean Jacques Barbille.”",
        "“Monsieur–monsieur le juge, you mean that I shall do this, shall see\nGeorge Masson and warn him–me?”",
        "“Who else?  You are a friend of the family.  You are a public officer, to\nwhom the good name of your parish is dear.  As all are aware, no doubt,\nyou are the trusted ancient comrade of the daughter of the woman–I speak\nlegally–Carmen Barbille nee Dolores, a name of charm to the ear.  Who\nbut you then to do it?”",
        "“There is yourself, monsieur.”",
        "“Dismiss me from your mind.  I go to Quebec to-night, as you know, and\nthere is not time; but even if there were, I should not be the best\nperson to do this.  I am known to few; you are known to all.  I have no\nlocus standi.  You have.  No, no, it would not be for me.”",
        "Suddenly, in his desperation, the Clerk of the Court sought release for\nhimself from this solemn and frightening duty.",
        "“Monsieur,” he said eagerly, “there is another.  I had forgotten.  It is\nMadame Carmen’s father, Sebastian Dolores.”",
        "“Ah, a father!  Yes, I had forgotten to ask about him; so we are one in\nour imbecility, my little Aristotle.  This Sebastian Dolores, where is\nhe?”",
        "“In the next parish, Beauharnais, keeping books for a lumber-firm.  Ah,\nmonsieur, that is the way to deal with the matter–through Sebastian\nDolores, her father!”",
        "“What sort is he?”",
        "The other shook his head and did not answer.  “Ah, not of the best?\nDrinks?”",
        "M. Fille nodded.",
        "“Has a weak character?”",
        "Again M. Fille nodded.",
        "“Has no good reputation hereabouts?”",
        "The nod was repeated.  “He has never been steady He goes here and there,\nbut always he comes back to get Jean Jacques’ help.  He and his daughter\nare not close friends, and yet he likes to be near her.  She can endure\nhim at least.  He can command her interest.  He is a stranger in a\nstrange land, and he drifts back to where she is always.  But that is\nall.”",
        "“Then he is out of the question, and he would be always out of the\nquestion except as a last resort; for sooner or later he would tell his\ndaughter, and challenge our George Masson too; and that is what you do\nnot wish, eh?”",
        "“Precisely so,” remarked M. Fille, dropping back again into gloom.  “To\nbe quite honest, monsieur, even though it gives me a task which I abhor,\nI do not think that M. Dolores could do what is needed without mistakes\nwhich could not be mended.  At least I can–”  He stopped.",
        "The Judge interposed at once, well pleased with the way things were going\nfor this “case.”  “Assuredly.  You can as can no other, my Solon.  The\nsecret of success in such things is a good heart, a right mind, a clear\nintelligence and some astuteness, and you have it all.  It is your task\nand yours only.”",
        "The little man’s self-respect seemed restored.  He preened himself\nsomewhat and bowed to the Judge.  “I take your commands, monsieur, to\nobey them as heaven gives me power so to do.  Shall it be tomorrow?”",
        "The Judge reflected a moment, then said: “Tonight would be better, but–”",
        "“I can do it better to-morrow morning,” interposed M. Fille, “for George\nMasson has a meeting here at Vilray with the avocat Prideaux at ten\no’clock to sign a contract, and I can ask him to step into my office on a\nlittle affair of business.  He will not guess, and I shall be armed\"–the\nJudge frowned–\"with the book of the law on such misdemeanours, and the\nfigures of the damages,\"–the Judge smiled–\"and I think perhaps I can\nfrighten him as he has never been frightened before.”",
        "A courage and confidence had now taken possession of the Clerk in strange\ncontrast to his timidity and childlike manner of a few minutes before.\nHe was now as he appeared in court, clothed with an austere authority\nwhich gave him a vicarious strength and dignity.  The Judge had done his\nwork well, and he was of those folk in the world who are not content to\ndo even the smallest thing ill.",
        "Arm in arm they passed into the garden which fronted the vine-covered\nhouse, where Maitre Fille lived alone with his sister, a tiny edition of\nhimself, who whispered and smiled her way through life.",
        "She smiled and whispered now in welcome to the Judge; and as she did so,\nthe three saw Jean Jacques, laughing, and cracking his whip, drive past\nwith his daughter beside him, chirruping to the horses; while, moody and\nabstracted, his wife sat silent on the backseat of the red wagon.",
        "Jean Jacques was in great good humour as he drove away to the Manor\nCartier.  The day, which was not yet aged, had been satisfactory from\nevery point of view.  He had impressed the Court, he had got a chance to\npose in the witness-box; he had been able to repeat in evidence the\nnumerous businesses in which he was engaged; had referred to his\nacquaintance with the Lieutenant-Governor and a Cardinal; to his Grand\nTour (this had been hard to do in the cross-examination to which he was\nsubjected, but he had done it); and had been able to say at the very\nstart in reply as to what was his occupation–\"Moi je suis M’sieu’ Jean\nJacques, philosophe.”",
        "Also he had, during the day, collected a debt long since wiped off his\nbooks; he had traded a poor horse for a good cow; he had bought all the\nwheat of a Vilray farmer below market-price, because the poor fellow\nneeded ready money; he had issued an insurance policy; his wife and\ndaughter had conversed in the public streets with the great judge who was\nthe doyen of the provincial Bench; and his daughter had been kissed by\nthe same judge in the presence of at least a dozen people.  He was, in\nfact, very proud of his Carmen and his Carmencita, as he called the two\nwho sat in the red wagon sharing his glory–so proud that he did not\nextol them to others; and he was quite sure they were both very proud of\nhim.  The world saw what his prizes of life were, and there was no need\nto praise or brag.  Dignity and pride were both sustained by silence and\na wave of the hand, which in fact said to the world, “Look you, my\nmasters, they belong to Jean Jacques.  Take heed.”",
        "There his domestic scheme practically ended.  He was so busy that he took\nhis joys by snatches, in moments of suspension of actual life, as it\nwere.  His real life was in the eddy of his many interests, in the field\nof his superficial culture, in the eyes of the world.  The worst of him\nwas on the surface.  He showed what other men hid, that was all.  Their\nvanity was concealed, he wore it in his cap.  They put on a manner as\nthey put on their clothes, and wore it out in the world, or took it off\nin their own homes-behind the door of life; but he was the same vain,\nfrank, cocksure fellow in his home as in the street.  There was no\ndifference at all.  He was vain, but he had no conceit; and therefore he\ndid not deceive, and was not tyrannous or dictatorial; in truth, if you\nbut estimated him at his own value, he was the least insistent man alive.\nMany a debtor knew this; and, by asking Jean Jacques’ advice, making an\nappeal to his logic, as it were–and it was always worth listening to,\neven when wrong or sadly obvious, because of the glow with which he\ndeclared things this or that–found his situation immediately eased.\nMany a hard-up countryman, casting about for a five-dollar bill, could\nget it of Jean Jacques by telling him what agreeable thing some important\nperson had said about him; or by writing to a great newspaper in Montreal\na letter, saying that the next candidate for the provincial legislature\nshould be M. Jean Jacques Barbille, of St. Saviour’s.  This never failed\nto draw a substantial “bill” from the wad which Jean Jacques always\ncarried in his pocket-loose, not tied up in a leather roll, as so many\nlesser men freighted the burdens of their wealth.",
        "He had changed since the day he left Bordeaux on the Antoine; since he\nhad first caught the flash of interest in Carmen Dolores’ eyes–an\ninterest roused from his likeness to a conspirator who had been shot for\nhis country’s good.  He was no stouter in body, for he was of the kind\nthat wear away the flesh by much doing and thinking; but there were\noccasional streaks of grey in his bushy hair, and his eye roamed less\nthan it did once.  In the days when he first brought Carmen home, his eye\nwas like a bead of brown light on a swivel.  It flickered and flamed; it\nsaw here, saw there; it twinkled, and it pierced into life’s mysteries;\nand all the while it was a good eye.  Its whites never showed, as it\nwere.  As an animal, his eye showed a nature free from vice.  In some\nrespects he was easy to live with, for he never found fault with what\nwas given him to eat, or the way the house was managed; and he never\ninterfered with the “kitchen people,” or refused a dollar or ten dollars\nto Carmen for finery.  In fact, he was in a sense too lavish, for he used\nat one time to bring her home presents of silks and clothes and toilet\nthings and stockings and hats, which were not in accord with her taste,\nand only vexed her.  Indeed, she resented wearing them, and could hardly\nbring herself to thank him for them.  At last, however, she induced him\nto let her buy what she wanted with the presents of money which he might\ngive her.",
        "On the whole Carmen fared pretty well, for he would sometimes give her a\nhandful of bills from his pocket, bidding her take ten dollars, and she\nwould coolly take twenty, while he shrugged his shoulders and declared\nshe would be his ruin.  He had never repented of marrying her, in spite\nof the fact that she did not always keep house as his mother and\ngrandmother had kept it; that she was gravely remiss in going to mass;\nand that she quarrelled with more than one of her neighbours, who had an\nidea that Spain was an inferior country because it was south of France,\njust as the habitants regarded the United States as a low and inferior\ncountry because it was south of Quebec.  You went north towards heaven\nand south towards hell, in their view; but when they went so far as to\npatronize or slander Carmen, she drove her verbal stilettos home without\na button; so that on one occasion there would have been a law-suit for\nlibel if the Old Cure had not intervened.  To Jean Jacques’ credit,\nbe it said, he took his wife’s part on this occasion, though in his\nheart he knew that she was in the wrong.",
        "He certainly was not always in the right himself.  If he had been told\nthat he neglected his wife he would have been justly indignant.  Also, it\nnever occurred to him that a woman did not always want to talk philosophy\nor discuss the price of wheat or the cost of flour-barrels; and that for\na man to be stupidly and foolishly fond was dearer to a woman than\nanything else.  How should he know–yet he ought to have done so, if he\nreally was a philosopher–that a woman would want the cleverest man in\nthe world to be a boy and play the fool sometimes; that she would rather,\nif she was a healthy woman, go to a circus than to a revelation of the\nmysteries of the mind from an altar of culture, if her own beloved man\nwas with her.",
        "Carmen had been left too much alone, as M. Fille had said to Judge\nCarcasson.  Her spirits had moments of great dullness, when she was ready\nto fling herself into the river–or the arms of the schoolmaster or the\nfarrier.  When she first came to St. Saviour’s, the necessity of adapting\nherself to the new conditions, of keeping faith with herself, which she\nhad planned on the Antoine, and making a good wife to the man who was to\nsolve all her problems for her, prevailed.  She did not at first miss so\nmuch the life of excitement, of danger, of intrigue, of romance, of\ncolour and variety, which she had left behind in Spain.  When her child\nwas born, she became passionately fond of it; her maternal spirit\nsmothered it.  It gave the needed excitement in the routine of life at\nSt. Saviour’s.",
        "Yet the interest was not permanent.  There came a time when she resented\nthe fact that Jean Jacques made more of the child than he did of herself.\nThat was a bad day for all concerned, for dissimulation presently became\nnecessary, and the home of Jean Jacques was a home of mystery which no\nphilosophy could interpret.  There had never been but the one child.  She\nwas not less handsome than when Jean Jacques married her and brought her\nhome, though the bloom of maiden youthfulness was no longer there; and\nshe certainly was a cut far above the habitant women or even the others\nof a higher social class, in a circle which had an area equal to a\nprincipality in Europe.",
        "The old cure, M. Langon, had had much influence over her, for few could\nresist the amazing personal influence which his rare pure soul secured\nover the worst.  It was a sad day to her when he went to his long home;\nand inwardly she felt a greater loss than she had ever felt, save that\nonce when her Carvillho Gonzales went the way of the traitor.  Memories\nof her past life far behind in Madrid did not grow fainter; indeed, they\ngrew more distinct as the years went on.  They seemed to vivify, as her\ndiscontent and restlessness grew.",
        "Once, when there had come to St. Saviour’s a middle-aged baron from Paris\nwho had heard the fishing was good at St. Saviour’s, and talked to her of\nMadrid and Barcelona, of Cordova and Toledo, as one who had seen and\nknown and (he declared) loved them; who painted for her in splashing\nimpressionist pictures the life that still eddied in the plazas and\ndreamed in the patios, she had been almost carried off her feet with\nlonging; and she nearly gave that longing an expression which would have\nbrought a tragedy, while still her Zoe was only eight years old.  But\nM. Langon, the wise priest whose eyes saw and whose heart understood,\nhad intervened in time; and she never knew that the sudden disappearance\nof the Baron, who still owed fifty dollars to Jean Jacques, was due to\nthe practical wisdom of a great soul which had worked out its own destiny\nin a little back garden of the world.",
        "When this good priest was alive she felt she had a friend who was as\nlarge of heart as he was just, and who would not scorn the fool according\nto his folly, or chastise the erring after his deserts.  In his greatness\nof soul Pere Langon had shut his eyes to things that pained him more\nthan they shocked him, for he had seen life in its most various and\ndemoralized forms, and indeed had had his own temptations when he lived\nin Belgium and France, before he had finally decided to become a priest.\nHe had protected Carmen with a quiet persistency since her first day in\nthe parish, and had had a saving influence over her.  Pere Langon\nreproved those who criticized her and even slandered her, for it was\nevident to all that she would rather have men talk to her than women;\nand any summer visitor who came to fish, gave her an attention never\ngiven even to the youngest and brightest in the district; and the eyes\nof the habitant lass can be very bright at twenty.  Yet whatever Carmen’s\ncoquetry and her sport with fire had been, her own emotions had never\nbeen really involved till now.",
        "The new cure, M. Savry, would have said they were involved now because\nshe never came to confession, and indeed, since the Old Cure died, she\nhad seldom gone to mass.  Yet when, with accumulated reproof on his\ntongue, M. Savry did come to the Manor Cartier, he felt the inherent\nsupremacy of beauty, not the less commanding because it had not the\nrefinement of the duchess or the margravine.",
        "Once M. Savry ventured to do what the Old Cure would never have done–he\nspoke to Jean Jacques concerning Carmen’s neglect of mass and confession,\nand he received a rebuff which was almost au seigneur; for in Jean\nJacques’ eyes he was now the figure in St. Saviour’s; and this was an\noccasion when he could assert his position as premier of the secular\nworld outside the walls of the parish church.  He did it in good style\nfor a man who had had no particular training in the social arts.",
        "This is how he did it and what he said:",
        "“There have been times when I myself have thought it would be a good\nthing to have a rest from the duties of a Catholic, m’sieu’ le cure,” he\nremarked to M. Savry, when the latter had ended his criticism.  He said\nit with an air of conflict, and with full intent to make his supremacy\ncomplete.",
        "“No Catholic should speak like that,” returned the shocked priest.",
        "“No priest should speak to me as you have done,” rejoined Jean Jacques.\n\"What do you know of the reasons for the abstention of madame?  The soul\nmust enjoy rest as well as the body, and madame has a–mind which can\njudge for itself.  I have a body that is always going, and it gets too\nlittle rest, and that keeps my soul in a flutter too.  It must be getting\nto mass and getting to confession, and saying aves and doing penance,\nit is such a busy little soul of mine; but we are not all alike, and\nmadame’s body goes in a more stately way.  I am like a comet, she is\nlike the sun steady, steady, round and round, with plenty of sleep and\nthe comfortable darkness.  Sometimes madame goes hard; so does the sun\nin summer-shines, shines, shines like a furnace.  Madame’s body goes like\nthat–at the dairy, in the garden, with the loom, among the fowls,\ngrowing her strawberries, keeping the women at the beating of the flax;\nand then again it is all still and idle like the sun on a cloudy day;\nand it rests.  So it is with the human soul–I am a philosopher–I think\nthe soul goes hard the same as the body, churning, churning away in the\nheat of the sun; and then it gets quiet and goes to sleep in the cloudy\nday, when the body is sick of its bouncing, and it has a rest–the soul\nhas a rest, which is good for it, m’sieu’.  I have worked it all out so.\nBesides, the soul of madame is her own.  I have not made any claim upon\nit, and I will not expect you to do more, m’sieu’ le cure.”",
        "“It is my duty to speak,” protested the good priest.  “Her soul is God’s,\nand I am God’s vicar–”",
        "Jean Jacques waved a hand.  “T’sh, you are not the Pope.  You are not\neven an abbe.  You were only a deacon a few years ago.  You did not know\nhow to hold a baby for the christening when you came to St. Saviour’s\nfirst.  For the mass, you have some right to speak; it is your duty\nperhaps; but the confession, that is another thing; that is the will of\nevery soul to do or not to do.  What do you know of a woman’s soul-well,\nperhaps, you know what they have told you; but madame’s soul–”",
        "“Madame has never been to confession to me,” interjected M. Savry\nindignantly.  Jean Jacques chuckled.  He had his New Cure now for sure.",
        "“Confession is for those who have sinned.  Is it that you say one must go\nto confession, and in order to go to confession it is needful to sin?”",
        "M. Savry shivered with pious indignation.  He had a sudden desire to rend\nthis philosophic Catholic–to put him under the thumb-screw for the glory\nof the Lord, and to justify the Church; but the little Catholic miller-\nmagnate gave freely to St. Saviour’s; he was popular; he had a position;\nhe was good to the poor; and every Christmas-time he sent a half-dozen\nbags of flour to the presbytery!",
        "All Pere Savry ventured to say in reply was: “Upon your head be it,\nM. Jean Jacques.  I have done my duty.  I shall hope to see madame at\nmass next Sunday.”",
        "Jean Jacques had chuckled over that episode, for he had conquered;\nhe had shown M. Savry that he was master in his own household and outside\nit.  That much his philosophy had done for him.  No other man in the\nparish would have dared to speak to the Cure like that.  He had never\nscolded Carmen when she had not gone to church.  Besides, there was\nCarmen’s little daughter always at his side at mass; and Carmen always\ninsisted on Zoe going with him, and even seemed anxious for them to be\noff at the first sound of the bells of St. Saviour’s.  Their souls were\nbusy, hers wanted rest; that was clear.  He was glad he had worked it out\nso cleverly to the Cure–and to his own mind.  His philosophy surely had\nvindicated itself.",
        "But Jean Jacques was far from thinking of these things as he drove back\nfrom Vilray and from his episode in Court to the Manor Cartier.  He was\nindeed just praising himself, his wife, his child, and everything that\nbelonged to him.  He was planning, planning, as he talked, the new things\nto do–the cheese-factory, the purchase of a steam-plough and a steam-\nthresher which he could hire out to his neighbours.  Only once during the\ndrive did he turn round to Carmen, and then it was to ask her if she had\nseen her father of late.",
        "“Not for ten months,” was her reply.  “Why do you ask?”",
        "“Wouldn’t he like to be nearer you and Zoe?  It’s twelve miles to\nBeauharnais,” he replied.",
        "“Are you thinking of offering him another place at the Manor?” she asked\nsharply.",
        "“Well, there is the new cheese-factory–not to manage, but to keep the\nbooks!  He’s doing them all right for the lumber-firm.  I hear that he–”",
        "“I don’t want it.  No good comes from relatives working together.  Look\nat the Latouche farm where your cousin makes his mess.  My father is well\nenough where he is.”",
        "“But you’d like to see him oftener–I was only thinking of that,” said\nJean Jacques in a mollifying voice.  It was the kind of thing in which he\nshowed at once the weakness and the kindness of his nature.  He was in\nfact not a philosopher, but a sentimentalist.",
        "“If mother doesn’t think it’s sensible, why do it, father?” asked Zoe\nanxiously, looking up into her father’s face.",
        "She had seen the look in her mother’s eyes, and also she had no love for\nher grandfather.  Her instinct had at one time wavered regarding him; but\nshe had seen an incident with a vanished female cook, and though she had\nnot understood, a prejudice had been created in her mind.  She was always\ncontrasting him with M. Fille, who, to her mind, was what a grandfather\nought to be.",
        "“I won’t have him beholden to you,” said Carmen, almost passionately.",
        "“He is of my family,” said Jean Jacques firmly and chivalrously.  “There\nis no question of being beholden.”",
        "“Let well enough alone,” was the gloomy reply.  With a sigh, Jean Jacques\nturned back to the study of the road before him, to gossip with Zoe, and\nto keep on planning subconsciously the new things he must do.",
        "Carmen sighed too, or rather she gave a gasp of agitation and annoyance.\nHer father?  She had lost whatever illusion once existed regarding him.\nFor years he had clung to her–to her pocket.  He was given to drinking\nin past years, and he still had his sprees.  Like the rest of the world,\nshe had not in earlier years seen the furtiveness in his handsome face;\nbut at last, as his natural viciousness became stereotyped, and bad\nhabits matured and emphasized, she saw beneath his mask of low-class\ncomeliness.  When at last she had found it necessary to dismiss the best\ncook she ever had, because of him, they saw little of each other.  This\nwas coincident with his failure at the ash-factory, where he mismanaged\nand even robbed Jean Jacques right and left; and she had firmly insisted\non Jean Jacques evicting him, on the ground that it was not Sebastian\nDolores’ bent to manage a business.",
        "This little episode, as they drove home from Vilray, had an unreasonable\neffect upon her.",
        "It was like the touch of a finger which launches a boat balancing in the\nways onto the deep.  It tossed her on a sea of agitation.  She was swept\naway on a flood of morbid reflection.",
        "Her husband and her daughter, laughing and talking in the front seat of\nthe red wagon, seemed quite oblivious of her, and if ever there was a\ntime when their influence was needed it was now.  George Masson was\ncoming over late this afternoon to inspect the work he had been doing;\nand she was trembling with an agitation which, however, did not show upon\nthe surface.  She had not seen him for two days–since the day after the\nClerk of the Court had discovered her in the arms of a man who was not\nher husband; but he was coming this evening, and he was coming to-morrow\nfor the last time; for the repair work on the flume of the dam would all\nbe finished then.",
        "But would the work he had been doing all be finished then?  As she\nthought of that incident of three days ago and of its repetition on the\nfollowing day, she remembered what he had said to her as she snatched\nherself almost violently from his arms, in a sudden access of remorse.\nHe had said that it had to be, that there was no escape now; and at his\nwords she had felt every pulse in her body throbbing, every vein\nexpanding with a hot life which thrilled and tortured her.  Life had been\nso meagre and so dull, and the man who had worshipped her on the Antoine\nnow worshipped himself only, and also Zoe, the child, maybe; or so she\nthought; while the man who had once possessed her whole mind and whole\nheart, and never her body, back there in Spain, he, Carvillho Gonzales,\nwould have loved her to the end, in scenes where life had colour and\npassion and danger and delightful movement.",
        "She was one of those happy mortals who believe that the dead and gone\nlover was perfect, and that in losing him she was losing all that life\nhad in store; but the bare, hard truth was that her Gonzales could have\nbeen true neither to her nor to any woman in the world for longer than\none lingering year, perhaps one lunar month.  It did not console her–\nshe did not think of it-that the little man on the seat of the red wagon,\nchirruping with their daughter, had been, would always be, true to her.\nOf what good was fidelity if he that was faithful desired no longer as\nhe once did?",
        "A keen observer would have seen in the glowing, unrestful look, in the\nhot cheek, in the interlacing fingers, that a contest was going on in the\nwoman’s soul, as she drove homeward with all that was her own in the\nworld.  The laughter of her husband and child grated painfully on her\nears.  Why should they be mirthful while her life was being swept by a\nstorm of doubt, temptation, and dark passion?  Why was it?",
        "Yet she smiled at Jean Jacques when he lifted her down from the red wagon\nat the door of the Manor Cartier, even though he lifted his daughter down\nfirst.",
        "Did she smile at Jean Jacques because, as they came toward the Manor,\nshe saw George Masson in the distance by the flume, and in that moment\ndecided to keep her promise and meet him at a secluded point on the\nriver-bank at sunset after supper?",
        "The pensiveness of a summer evening on the Beau Cheval was like a veil\nhung over all the world.  While yet the sun was shining, there was the\ntremor of life in the sadness; but when the last glint of amethyst and\ngold died away behind Mont Violet, and the melancholy swish of the river\nagainst the osiered banks rose out of the windless dusk, all the region\naround Manor Cartier, with its cypresses, its firs, its beeches, and its\nelms, became gently triste.  Even the weather-vane on the Manor–the gold\nCock of Beaugard, as it was called–did not move; and the stamping of a\nhorse in the stable was like the thunderous knock of a traveller from\nBeyond.  The white mill and the grey manor stood out with ghostly\nvividness in the light of the rising moon.  Yet there were times\ninnumerable when they looked like cool retreats for those who wanted\nrest; when, in the summer solstice, they offered the pleasant peace of\nthe happy fireside.  How often had Jean Jacques stood off from it all of\na summer night and said to himself: “Look at that, my Jean Jacques.  It\nis all yours, Manor and mills and farms and factory–all.”",
        "“Growing, growing, fattening, while I drone in my feather bed,” he had\nas often said, with the delighted observation of the philosopher.  “And\nme but a young man yet–but a mere boy,” he would add.  “I have piled it\nup–I have piled it up, and it keeps on growing, first one thing and then\nanother.”",
        "Could such a man be unhappy?  Finding within himself his satisfaction,\nhis fountain of appeasement, why should not his days be days of\npleasantness and peace?  So it appeared to him during that summer, just\npassed, when he had surveyed the World and his world within the World,\nand it seemed to his innocent mind that he himself had made it all.\nThere he was, not far beyond forty, and eligible to become a member\nof Parliament, or even a count of the Holy Roman Empire!  He had thought\nof both these honours, but there was so much to occupy him–he never had\na moment to himself, except at night; and then there was planning and\naccounting to do, his foremen to see, or some knotty thing to\ndisentangle.  But when the big clock in the Manor struck ten, and he took\nout his great antique silver watch, to see if the two marched to the\nsecond, he would go to the door, look out into the night, say, “All’s\nwell, thank the good God,” and would go to bed, very often forgetting to\nkiss Carmen, and even forgetting his darling little Zoe.",
        "After all, a mind has to be very big and to have very many tentacles to\nhold so many things all at once, and also to remember to do the right\nthing at the right moment every time.  He would even forget to ask Carmen\nto play on the guitar, which in the first days of their married life was\nthe recreation of every evening.  Seldom with the later years had he\nasked her to sing, because he was so busy; and somehow his ear had not\nthat keenness of sound once belonging to it.  There was a time when he\nhimself was wont to sing, when he taught his little Zoe the tunes of the\nChansons Canadiennes; but even that had dropped away, except at rare\nintervals, when he would sing Le Petit Roger Bontemps, with Petite Fleur\nde Bois, and a dozen others; but most he would sing–indeed there was\nnever a sing-song in the Manor Cartier but he would burst forth with A la\nClaire Fontaine and its haunting refrain:",
        "                   “Il y a longtemps que je t’aime,\n                    Jamais je ne t’oublierai.”",
        "But this very summer, when he had sung it on the birthday of the little\nZoe, his voice had seemed out of tune.  At first he had thought that\nCarmen was playing his accompaniment badly on the guitar, but she had\nsharply protested against that, and had appealed to M. Fille, who was\npresent at the pretty festivity.  He had told the truth, as a Clerk of\nthe Court should.  He said that Jean Jacques’ voice was not as he had so\noften heard it; but he would also frankly admit that he did not think\nmadame played the song as he had heard her play it aforetime, and that\ncovered indeed twelve years or more–in fact, since the birth of the\nrenowned Zoe.",
        "M. Fille had wondered much that night of June at the listless manner and\nlistless playing of Carmen Barbille.  For a woman of such spirit and fire\nit would seem as though she must be in ill-health to play like that.  Yet\nwhen he looked at her he saw only the comeliness of a woman whom the life\nof the haut habitant had not destroyed or, indeed, dimmed.  Her skin was\nsmooth, she had no wrinkles, and her neck was a pillar of softly moulded\nwhite flesh, around which a man might well string unset jewels, if he had\nthem; for the tint and purity of her skin would be a better setting than\nplatinum or fine gold.  But the Clerk of the Court was really\nunsophisticated, or he would have seen that Carmen played the guitar\nbadly because she was not interested in Jean Jacques’ singing.  He would\nhave known that she had come to that stage in her married life when the\ntenure is pitifully insecure.  He would have seen that the crisis was\nnear.  If he had had any real observation he would have noticed that\nCarmen’s eyes at once kindled, and that the guitar became a different\nthing, when M. Colombin, the young schoolmaster, one of the guests,\ncaught up the refrain of A la Claire Fontaine, and in a soft tenor voice\nsang it with Jean Jacques to the end, and then sang it again with Zoe.\nThen Carmen’s dark eyes deepened with the gathering light in them, her\nbody seemed to vibrate and thrill with emotion; and when M. Colombin and\nZoe ceased, with her eyes fixed on the distance, and as though\nunconscious of them all, she began to sing a song of Cadiz which she had\nnot sung since boarding the Antoine at Bordeaux.  Her mind had, suddenly\nflown back out of her dark discontent to the days when all life was\nbefore her, and, with her Gonzales, she had moved in an atmosphere of\nromance, adventure and passion.",
        "In a second she was transformed from the wife of the brown money-master\nto the girl she was when she came to St. Saviour’s from the plaza, where\nher Carvillho Gonzales was shot, with love behind her and memory blazoned\nin the red of martyrdom.  She sang now as she had not sung for some\nyears.  Her guitar seemed to leap into life, her face shone with the hot\npassion of memory, her voice rang with the pain of a disappointed life:",
        "              “Granada, Granada, thy gardens are gay,\n               And bright are thy stars, the high stars above;\n               But as flowers that fade and are gray,\n               But as dusk at the end of the day,\n               Are ye to the light in the eyes of my love\n               In the eyes, in the soul, of my love.",
        "              “Granada, Granada, oh, when shall I see\n               My love in thy gardens, there waiting for me?",
        "              “Beloved, beloved, have pity, and make\n               Not the sun shut its eyes, its hot, envious eyes,\n               And the world in the darkness of night\n               Be debtor to thee for its light.\n               Turn thy face, turn thy face from the skies\n               To the love, to the pain in my eyes.",
        "              “Granada, Granada, oh, when shall I see\n               My love in thy gardens, there waiting for me!”",
        "From that night forward she had been restless and petulant and like one\nwatching and waiting.  It seemed to her that she must fly from the life\nwhich was choking her.  It was all so petty and so small.  People went\nabout sneaking into other people’s homes like detectives; they turned\nyellow and grew scrofulous from too much salt pork, green tea, native\ntobacco, and the heat of feather beds.  The making of a rag carpet was an\nevent, the birth of a baby every year till the woman was forty-five was a\ncommonplace; but the exit of a youth to a seminary to become a priest, or\nthe entrance to the novitiate of a young girl, were matters as important\nas a battle to Napoleon the Great.",
        "How had she gone through it all so long, she asked herself?  The presence\nof Jean Jacques had become almost unbearable when, the day done, he\nretired to the feather bed which she loathed, though he would have looked\nupon discarding it like the abdication of his social position.  A feather\nbed was a sign of social position; it was as much the dais to his honour\nas is the woolsack to the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords.",
        "She was waiting for something.  There was a restless, vagrant spirit\nalive in her now.  She had been so long inactive, tied by the leg,\nwith wings clipped; now her mind roamed into pleasant places of the\nimagination where life had freedom, where she could renew the impulses\nof youth.  A true philosopher-a man of the world-would have known for\nwhat she was waiting with that vague, disordered expectancy and yearning;\nbut there was no man of the world to watch and guide her this fateful\nsummer, when things began to go irretrievably wrong.",
        "Then George Masson came.  He was a man of the world in his way; he saw\nand knew better than the philosopher of the Manor Cartier.  He grasped\nthe situation with the mind of an artist in his own sphere, and with the\nknowledge got by experience.  Thus there had been the thing which the\nClerk of the Court saw from Mont Violet behind the Manor; and so it was\nthat as Jean Jacques helped Carmen down from the red wagon on their\nreturn from Vilray, she gave him a smile which was meant to deceive; for\nthough given to him it was really given to another man in her mind’s eye.\nAt sunset she gave it again to George Masson on the river-bank, only\nwarmer and brighter still, with eyes that were burning, with hands that\ntrembled, and with an agitated bosom more delicately ample than it was on\nthe day the Antoine was wrecked.",
        "Neither of these two adventurers into a wild world of feeling noticed\nthat a man was sitting on a little knoll under a tree, not far away from\ntheir meeting-place, busy with pencil and paper.",
        "It was Jean Jacques, who had also come to the river-bank to work out a\nbusiness problem which must be settled on the morrow.  He had stolen out\nimmediately after supper from neighbours who wished to see him, and had\ncome here by a roundabout way, because he wished to be alone.",
        "George Masson and Carmen were together for a few moments only, but Jean\nJacques heard his wife say, “Yes, to-morrow–for sure,” and then he saw\nher kiss the master-carpenter–kiss him twice, thrice.  After which they\nvanished, she in one direction, and the invader and marauder in another.",
        "If either of these two had seen the face of the man with a pencil\nand paper under the spreading beechtree, they would not have been so\nimpatient for tomorrow, and Carmen would not have said “for sure.”",
        "Jean Jacques was awake at last, man as well as philosopher.",
        "Jean Jacques was not without originality of a kind, and not without\ninitiative; but there were also the elements of the very old Adam in him,\nand the strain of the obvious.  If he had been a real genius, rather than\na mere lively variation of the commonplace–a chicken that could never\nburst its shell, a bird which could not quite break into song–he might\nhave made his biographer guess hard and futilely, as to what he would do\nafter having seen his wife’s arms around the neck of another man than\nhimself–a man little more than a manual labourer, while he, Jean Jacques\nBarbille, had come of the people of the Old Regime.  As it was, this\nmagnate of St. Saviour’s, who yesterday posed so sympathetically and\neffectively in the Court at Vilray as a figure of note, did the quite\nobvious thing: he determined to kill the master-carpenter from Laplatte.",
        "There was no genius in that.  When, from under the spreading beech-tree,\nJean Jacques saw his wife footing it back to her house with a light,\nwayward step; when he watched the master-carpenter vault over a stone\nfence five feet high with a smile of triumph mingled with doubt on his\nface, he was too stunned at first to move or speak.  If a sledge-hammer\nstrikes you on the skull, though your skull is of such a hardness that it\ndoes not break, still the shock numbs activity for awhile, at any rate.\nThe sledge-hammer had descended on Jean Jacques’ head, and also had\nstruck him between the eyes; and it is in the credit balance of his\nledger of life, that he refrained from useless outcry at the moment.\nSuch a stroke kills some men, either at once, or by lengthened torture;\nothers it sends mad, so that they make a clamour which draws the\nattention of the astonished and not sympathetic world; but it only\nparalysed Jean Jacques.  For a time he sat fascinated by the ferocity\nof the event, his eyes following the hurrying wife and the jaunty,\nswaggering master-carpenter with a strange, animal-like dismay and\napprehension.  They remained fixed with a kind of blank horror and\ndistraction on the landscape for some time after both had disappeared.",
        "At last, however, he seemed to recover his senses, and to come back from\nthe place where he had been struck by the hammer of treachery.  He seemed\nto realize again that he was still a part of the common world, not a\nhuman being swung through the universe on his heart-strings by a Gorgon.",
        "The paper and pencil in his hand brought him back from the far Gehenna\nwhere he had been, to the world again–how stony and stormy a world it\nwas, with the air gone as heavy as lead, with his feet so loaded down\nwith chains that he could not stir!  He had had great joy of this his\nworld; he had found it a place where every day were problems to be solved\nby an astute mind, problems which gave way before the master-thinker.\nThere was of course unhappiness in his world.  There was death, there was\naccident occasionally–had his own people not gone down under the scythe\nof time?  But in going they had left behind in real estate and other\nthings good compensation for their loss.  There was occasional suffering\nand poverty and trouble in his little kingdom; but a cord of wood here, a\nbarrel of flour there, a side of beef elsewhere, a little debt remitted,\na bag of dried apples, or an Indian blanket–these he gave, and had great\npleasure in giving; and so the world was not a place where men should\nhang their heads, but a place where the busy man got more than the worth\nof his money.",
        "It had never occurred to him that he was ever translating the world into\nterms of himself, that he went on his way saying in effect, “I am coming.\nI am Jean Jacques Barbille.  You have heard of me.  You know me.  Wave a\nhand to me, duck your head to me, crack the whip or nod when I pass.  I\nam M’sieu’ Jean Jacques, philosopher.”",
        "And all the while he had only been vaguely, not really, conscious of his\nwife and child.  He did not know that he had only made of his wife an\nincident in his life, in spite of the fact that he thought he loved her;\nthat he had been proud of her splendid personality; and that, with\npassionate chivalry, he had resented any criticism of her.",
        "He thought still, as he did on the Antoine, that Carmen’s figure had the\nlines of the Venus of Milo, that her head would have been a model either\nfor a Madonna, or for Joan of Arc, or the famous Isabella of Aragon.\nHaving visited the Louvre and the Luxembourg all in one day, he felt he\nwas entitled to make such comparisons, and that in making them he was on\nsure ground.  He had loved to kiss Carmen in the neck, it was so full and\nsoft and round; and when she went about the garden with her dress\nshortened, and he saw her ankles, even after he had been married thirteen\nyears, and she was thirty-four, he still admired, he still thought that\nthe world was a good place when it produced such a woman.  And even when\nshe had lashed him with her tongue, as she did sometimes, he still\nlaughed–after the smart was over–because he liked spirit.  He would\nnever have a horse that had not some blood, and he had never driven a\nsluggard in his life more than once.  But wife and child and world, and\nall that therein was, existed largely because they were necessary to Jean\nJacques.",
        "That is the way it had been; and it was as though the firmament had been\nrolled up before his eyes, exposing the everlasting mysteries, when he\nsaw his wife in the arms of the master-carpenter.  It was like some\nfrightening dream.",
        "The paper and pencil waked him to reality.  He looked towards his house,\nhe looked the way George Masson had gone, and he knew that what he had\nseen was real life and not a dream.  The paper fell from his hand.  He\ndid not pick it up.  Its fall represented the tumbling walls of life, was\nthe earthquake which shook his world into chaos.  He ground the sheet\ninto the gravel with his heel.  There would be no cheese-factory built at\nSt. Saviour’s for many a year to come.  The man of initiative, the man of\nthe hundred irons would not have the hundred and one, or keep the hundred\nhot any more; because he would be so busy with the iron which had entered\ninto his soul.",
        "When the paper had been made one with the earth, a problem buried for\never, Jean Jacques pulled himself up to his full height, as though facing\na great thing which he must do.",
        "“Well, of course!” he said firmly.",
        "That was what his honour, Judge Carcasson, had said a few hours before,\nwhen the little Clerk of the Court had remarked an obvious thing about\nthe case of Jean Jacques.",
        "And Jean Jacques said only the obvious thing when he made up his mind to\ndo the obvious thing–to kill George Masson, the master-carpenter.",
        "This was evidence that he was no genius.  Anybody could think of killing\na man who had injured him, as the master-carpenter had done Jean Jacques.\nIt is the solution of the problem of the Patagonian.  It is old as\nRameses.",
        "Yet in his own way Jean Jacques did what he felt he had to do.  The thing\nhe was going to do was hopelessly obvious, but the doing of it was Jean\nJacques’ own; and it was not obvious; and that perhaps was genius after\nall.  There are certain inevitable things to do, and for all men to do;\nand they have been doing them from the beginning of time; but the way it\nis done–is not that genius?  There is no new story in the world; all the\nthings that happen have happened for untold centuries; but the man who\ntells the story in a new way, that is genius, so the great men say.  If,\nthen, Jean Jacques did the thing he had to do with a turn of his own, he\nwould justify to some degree the opinion he had formed of himself.",
        "As he walked back to his desecrated home he set himself to think.  How\nshould it be done?  There was the rifle with which he had killed deer in\nthe woods beyond the Saguenay and bear beyond the Chicoutimi.  That was\nsimple–and it was obvious; and it could be done at once.  He could soon\novertake the man who had spoiled the world for him.",
        "Yet he was a Norman, and the Norman thinks before he acts.  He is the\nsoul of caution; he wants to get the best he can out of his bargain.  He\nwill throw nothing away that is to his advantage.  There should be other\nways than the gun with which to take a man’s life–ways which might give\na Norman a chance to sacrifice only one life; to secure punishment where\nit was due, but also escape from punishment for doing the obvious thing.",
        "Poison?  That was too stupid even to think of once.  A pitch-fork and a\ndung-heap?  That had its merits; but again there was the risk of more\nthan one life.",
        "All the way to his house, Jean Jacques, with something of the rage of\npassion and the glaze of horror gone from his eyes, and his face not now\nso ghastly, still brooded over how, after he had had his say, he was to\nput George Masson out of the world.  But it did not come at once.  All\nmakers of life-stories find their difficulty at times.  Tirelessly they\ngrope along a wall, day in, day out, and then suddenly a great gate\nswings open, as though to the touch of a spring, and the whole way is\nclear to the goal.",
        "Jean Jacques went on thinking in a strange, new, intense abstraction.\nHis restless eyes were steadier than they had ever been; his wife noticed\nthat as he entered the house after the Revelation.  She noticed also his\npaleness and his abstraction.  For an instant she was frightened; but no,\nJean Jacques could not know anything.  Yet–yet he had come from the\ndirection of the river!",
        "“What is it, Jean Jacques?” she asked.  “Aren’t you well?”",
        "He put his hand to his head, but did not look her in the eyes.  His\ngesture helped him to avoid that.  “I have a head–la, such a head!\nI have been thinking, thinking-it is my hobby.  I have been planning\nthe cheese-factory, and all at once it comes on-the ache in my head.\nI will go to bed.  Yes, I will go at once.”  Suddenly he turned at the\ndoor leading to the bedroom.  “The little Zoe–is she well?”",
        "“Of course.  Why should she not be well?  She has gone to the top of the\nhill.  Of course, she’s well, Jean Jacques.”",
        "“Good-good!” he remarked.  Somehow it seemed strange to him that Zoe\nshould be well.  Was there not a terrible sickness in his house, and had\nnot that woman, his wife, her mother, brought the infection?  Was he\nhimself not stricken by it?",
        "Carmen was calm enough again.  “Go to bed, Jean Jacques,” she said, “and\nI’ll bring you a sleeping posset.  I know those headaches.  You had one\nwhen the ash-factory was burned.”",
        "He nodded without looking at her, and closed the door behind him.",
        "When she came to the bedroom a half-hour later, his face was turned to\nthe wall.  She spoke, but he did not answer.  She thought he was asleep.\nHe was not asleep.  He was only thinking how to do the thing which was\nnot obvious, which was also safe for himself.  That should be his\ntriumph, if he could but achieve it.",
        "When she came to bed he did not stir, and he did not answer her when she\nspoke.",
        "“The poor Jean Jacques!” he heard her say, and if there had not been\non him the same courage that possessed him the night when the Antoine\nwas wrecked, he would have sobbed.",
        "He did not stir.  He kept thinking; and all the time her words, “The poor\nJean Jacques!” kept weaving themselves through his vague designs.  Why\nhad she said that–she who had deceived, betrayed him?  Had he then seen\nwhat he had seen?",
        "She did not sleep for a long time, and when she did it was uneasily.  But\nthe bed was an immense one, and she was not near him.  There was no sleep\nfor him–not even for an hour.  Once, in exhaustion, he almost rolled\nover into the poppies of unconsciousness; but he came back with a start\nand a groan to sentient life again, and kept feeling, feeling along the\nwall of purpose for a masterly way to kill.",
        "At dawn it came, suddenly spreading out before him like a picture.  He\nsaw himself standing at the head of the flume out there by the Mill\nCartier with his hand on the lever.  Below him in the empty flume was the\nmaster-carpenter giving a last inspection to the repairs.  Beyond the\nmaster-carpenter–far beyond–was the great mill-wheel!  Behind himself,\nJean Jacques, was the river held back by the dam; and if the lever was\nopened,–the river would sweep through the raised gates down the flume to\nthe millwheel–with the man.  And then the wheel would turn and turn, and\nthe man would be in the wheel.",
        "It was not obvious; it was original; and it looked safe for Jean Jacques.\nHow easily could such an “accident” occur!",
        "The air was like a mellow wine, and the light on the landscape was full\nof wistfulness.  It was a thing so exquisite that a man of sentiment like\nJean Jacques in his younger days would have wept to see.  And the feeling\nwas as palpable as the seeing; as in the early spring the new life which\nis being born in the year, produces a febrile kind of sorrow in the mind.\nBut the glow of Indian summer, that compromise, that after-thought of\nreal summer, which brings her back for another good-bye ere she vanishes\nfor ever–its sadness is of a different kind.  Its longing has a sharper\nedge; there stir in it the pangs of discontent; and the mind and body\nyearn for solace.  It is a dangerous time, even more dangerous than\nspring for those who have passed the days of youth.",
        "It had proved dangerous to Carmen Barbille.  The melancholy of the\ngorgeously tinted trees, the flights of the birds to the south, the smell\nof the fallow field, the wind with the touch of the coming rains–these\nhad given to a growing discontent with her monotonous life the desire\nborn of self-pity.  In spite of all she could do she was turning to the\nlife she had left behind in Cadiz long ago.",
        "It seemed to her that Jean Jacques had ceased to care for the charms\nwhich once he had so proudly proclaimed.  There was in her the strain of\nthe religion of Epicurus.  She desired always that her visible corporeal\nself should be admired and desired, that men should say, “What a splendid\ncreature!”  It was in her veins, an undefined philosophy of life; and she\nhad ever measured the love of Jean Jacques by his caresses.  She had no\nother vital standard.  This she could measure, she could grasp it and\nsay, “Here I have a hold; it is so much harvested.”  But if some one had\nwritten her a poem a thousand verses long, she would have said, “Yes, all\nvery fine, but let me see what it means; let me feel that it is so.”",
        "She had an inherent love of luxury and pleasure, which was far more\nactive in her now than when she married Jean Jacques.  For a Spanish\nwoman she had matured late; and that was because, in her youth, she had\nbeen active and athletic, unlike most Spanish girls; and the microbes of\na sensuous life, or what might have become a sensual life, had not good\nchance to breed.",
        "It all came, however, in the dullness of the winter days and nights, in\nthe time of deep snows, when they could go abroad but very little.  Then\nher body and her mind seemed to long for the indolent sun-spaces of\nSpain.  The artificial heat of the big stoves in the rooms with the low\nceilings only irritated her, and she felt herself growing more ample from\nlassitude of the flesh.  This particular autumn it seemed to her that she\ncould not get through another winter without something going wrong,\nwithout a crisis of some sort.  She felt the need of excitement, of\nchange.  She had the desire for pleasures undefined.",
        "Then George Masson came, and the undefined took form almost at once.\nIt was no case of the hunter pursuing his prey with all the craft and\nsubtlety of his trade.  She had answered his look with spontaneity, due\nto the fact that she had been surprised into the candour of her feelings\nby the appearance of one who had the boldness of a brigand, the health of\na Hercules, and the intelligence of a primitive Jesuit.  He had not\nhesitated; he had yielded himself to the sumptuous attraction, and the\nfire in his eyes was only the window of the furnace within him.  He had\ngone headlong to the conquest, and by sheer force of temperament and\nweight of passion he had swept her off her feet.",
        "He had now come to the last day of his duty at the Mill Cartier, when all\nhe had to do was to inspect the work done, give assurance and guarantee\nthat it was all right, and receive his cheque from Jean Jacques.  He had\ncome early, because he had been unable to sleep well, and also he had\nmuch to do before keeping his tryst with Carmen Barbille in the\nafternoon.",
        "As he passed the Manor Cartier this fateful morning, he saw her at the\nwindow, and he waved his hat at her with a cheery salutation which she\ndid not hear.  He knew that she did not hear or see.  “My beauty!” he\nsaid aloud.  “My splendid girl, my charmer of Cadiz!  My wonder of the\nAlhambra, my Moorish maid!  My bird of freedom–hand of Charlemagne, your\nlips are sweet, yes, sweet as one-and-twenty!”",
        "His lips grew redder at the thought of the kisses he had taken, his\ncheek flushed with the thought of those he meant to take; and he laughed\ngreedily as he lowered himself into the flume by a ladder, just under the\nlever that opened the gates, to begin his inspection.",
        "It was not a perfunctory inspection, for he was a good craftsman, and he\nhad pride in what his workmen did.",
        "“Ah!”",
        "It was a sound of dumbfounded amazement, a hoarse cry of horror which was\nnot in tune with the beauty of the morning.",
        "“Ah!”",
        "It came from his throat like the groan of a trapped and wounded lion.\nGeorge Masson had almost finished his inspection, when he heard a noise\nbehind him.  He turned and looked back.  There stood Jean Jacques with\nhis hand on the lever.  The noise he had heard was the fourteen-foot\nladder being dropped, after Jean Jacques had drawn it up softly out of\nthe flume.",
        "“Ah!  Nom de Dieu!” George Masson exclaimed again in helpless fury and\nwith horror in his eyes.",
        "By instinct he understood that Carmen’s husband knew all.  He realized\nwhat Jean Jacques meant to do.  He knew that the lever locking the mill-\nwheel had been opened, and that Jean Jacques had his hand on the lever\nwhich raised the gate of the flume.",
        "By instinct–for there was no time for thought–he did the only thing\nwhich could help him, he made a swift gesture to Jean Jacques, a gesture\nthat bade him wait.  Time was his only friend in this–one minute, two\nminutes, three minutes, anything.  For if the gates were opened, he would\nbe swept into the millwheel, and there would be the end–the everlasting\nend.",
        "“Wait!” he called out after his gesture.  “One second!”",
        "He ran forward till he was about thirty feet from Jean Jacques standing\nthere above him, with the set face and the dark malicious, half-insane\neyes.  Even in his fear and ghastly anxiety, the subconscious mind of\nGeorge Masson was saying, “He looks like the Baron of Beaugard–like the\nBaron of Beaugard that killed the man who abused his wife.”",
        "It was so.  Great-great-grand-nephew of the Baron of Beaugard as he was,\nJean Jacques looked like the portrait of him which hung in the Manor\nCartier.  “Wait–but wait one minute!” exclaimed George Masson; and now,\nall at once, he had grown cool and determined, and his brain was at work\nagain with an activity and a clearness it had never known.  He had gained\none minute of time, he might be able to gain more.  In any case, no one\ncould save him except himself.  There was Jean Jacques with his hand on\nthe lever–one turn and the thing was done for ever.  If a rescuer was\neven within one foot of Jean Jacques, the deed could still be done.  It\nwas so much easier opening than shutting the gates of the flume!",
        "“Why should I wait, devil and rogue?”  The words came from Jean Jacques’\nlips with a snarl.  “I am going to kill you.  It will do you no good to\nwhine–cochon!”",
        "To call a man a pig is the worst insult which could be offered by one man\nto another in the parish of St. Saviour’s.  To be called a pig as you are\ngoing to die, is an offensive business indeed.",
        "“I know you are going to kill me–that you can kill me, and I can do\nnothing,” was the master-carpenter’s reply.  “There it is–a turn of the\nlever, and I am done.  Bien sur, I know how easy!  I do not want to die,\nbut I will not squeal even if I am a pig.  One can only die once.  And\nonce is enough .  .  .  No, don’t–not yet !  Give me a minute till I\ntell you something; then you can open the gates.  You will have a long\ntime to live–yes, yes, you are the kind that live long.  Well, a minute\nor two is not much to ask.  If you want to murder, you will open the\ngates at once; but if it is punishment, if you are an executioner, you\nwill give me time to pray.”",
        "Jean Jacques did not soften.  His voice was harsh and grim.  “Well, get\non with your praying, but don’t talk.  You are going to die,” he added,\nhis hands gripping the lever tighter.",
        "The master-carpenter had had the true inspiration in his hour of danger.\nHe had touched his appeal with logic, he had offered an argument.  Jean\nJacques was a logician, a philosopher!  That point made about the\ndifference between a murder and an execution was a good one.  Beside it\nwas an acknowledgment, by inference, from his victim, that he was getting\nwhat he deserved.",
        "“Pray quick and have it over, pig of an adulterer!” added Jean Jacques.",
        "The master-carpenter raised a protesting hand.  “There you are\nmistaken; but it is no matter.  At the end of to-day I would have been\nan adulterer, if you hadn’t found out.  I don’t complain of the word.\nBut see, as a philosopher\"–Jean Jacques jerked a haughty assent–\"as a\nphilosopher you will want to know how and why it is.  Carmen will never\ntell you–a woman never tells the truth about such things, because she\ndoes not know how.  She does not know the truth ever, exactly, about\nanything.  It is because she is a woman.  But I would like to tell you\nthe exact truth; and I can, because I am a man.  For what she did you\nare as much to blame as she .  .  .  no, no–not yet!”",
        "Jean Jacques’ hand had spasmodically tightened on the lever as though he\nwould wrench the gates open, and a snarl came from his lips.",
        "“Figure de Christ, but it is true, as true as death!  Listen, M’sieu’\nJean Jacques.  You are going to kill me, but listen so that you will know\nhow to speak to her afterwards, understanding what I said as I died.”",
        "“Get on–quick!” growled Jean Jacques with white wrinkled lips and the\nsun in his agonized eyes.  George Masson continued his pleading.  “You\nwere always a man of mind\"–Jean Jacques’ fierce agitation visibly\nsubsided, and a surly sort of vanity crept into his face–\"and you\nmarried a girl who cared more for what you did than what you thought–\nthat is sure, for I know women.  I am not married, and I have had much\nto do with many of them.  I will tell you the truth.  I left the West\nbecause of a woman–of two women.  I had a good business, but I could\nnot keep out of trouble with women.  They made it too easy for me.”",
        "“Peacock-pig!” exclaimed Jean Jacques with an ugly sneer.",
        "“Let a man when he is dying tell all the truth, to ease his mind,” said\nthe master-carpenter with a machiavellian pretence and cunning.  “It was\nvanity, it was, as you say; it was the peacock in me made me be the\nfriend of many women and not the husband of one.  I came down here to\nQuebec from the Far West to get away from consequences.  It was\nexpensive.  I had to sacrifice.  Well, here I am in trouble again–my\nlast trouble, and with the wife of a man that I respect and admire, not\nenough to keep my hands off his wife, but still that I admire.  It is my\nweakness that I could not be, as a man, honourable to Jean Jacques\nBarbille.  And so I pay the price; so I have to go without time to make\nmy will.  Bless heaven above, I have no wife–”",
        "“If you had a wife you would not be dying now.  You would not then meddle\nwith the home of Jean Jacques Barbille,” sneered Jean Jacques.  The note\nwas savage yet.",
        "“Ah, for sure, for sure!  It is so.  And if I lived I would marry at\nonce.”",
        "Desperate as his condition was, the master-carpenter could almost have\nlaughed at the idea of marriage preventing him from following the bent of\nhis nature.  He was the born lover.  If he had been as high as the Czar,\nor as low as the ditcher, he would have been the same; but it would be\nmadness to admit that to Jean Jacques now.",
        "“But, as you say, let me get on.  My time has come–”",
        "Jean Jacques jerked his head angrily.  “Enough of this.  You keep on\nsaying ’Wait a little,’ but your time has come.  Now take it so, and\ndon’t repeat.”",
        "“A man must get used to the idea of dying, or he will die hard,” replied\nthe master-carpenter, for he saw that Jean Jacques’ hands were not so\ntightly clenched on the lever now; and time was everything.  He had\nalready been near five minutes, and every minute was a step to a chance\nof escape–somehow.",
        "“I said you were to blame,” he continued.  “Listen, Jean Jacques\nBarbille.  You, a man of mind, married a girl who cared more for a touch\nof your hand than a bucketful of your knowledge, which every man in the\nprovince knows is great.  At first you were almost always thinking of her\nand what a fine woman she was, and because everyone admired her, you\nplayed the peacock, too.  I am not the only peacock.  You are a good man\n–no one ever said anything against your character.  But always, always,\nyou think most of yourself.  It is everywhere you go as if you say, ’Look\nout.  I am coming.  I am Jean Jacques Barbille.",
        "“’Make way for Jean Jacques.  I am from the Manor Cartier.  You have heard\nof me.’ .  .  .  That is the way you say things in your mind.  But all\nthe time the people say, ’That is Jean Jacques Barbille, but you should\nsee his wife.  She is a wonder.  She is at home at the Manor with the\ncows and the geese.  Jean Jacques travels alone through the parish to\nQuebec, to Three Rivers, to Tadousac, to the great exhibition at\nMontreal, but madame, she stays at home.  M’sieu’ Jean Jacques is nothing\nbeside her’–that is what the people say.  They admire you for your\nbrains, but they would have fallen down before your wife, if you had\ngiven her half a chance.”",
        "“Ah, that’s bosh–what do you know!” exclaimed Jean Jacques fiercely,\nbut he was fascinated too by the argument of the man whose life he was\ngoing to take.",
        "“I know the truth, my money-man.  Do you think she’d have looked at me if\nyou’d been to her what she thought I might be?  No, bien sur!  Did you\ntake her where she could see the world?  No.  Did you bring her presents?\nNo.  Did you say, ’Come along, we will make a little journey to see the\nworld?’  No.  Do you think that a woman can sit and darn your socks, and\ntidy your room, and bake you pancakes in the morning while you roast your\ntoes, and be satisfied with just that, and not long for something\noutside?”",
        "Jean Jacques was silent.  He did not move.  He was being hypnotized by a\nmind of subtle strength, by the logic of which he was so great a lover.",
        "The master-carpenter pressed his logic home.  “No, she must sit in your\nshadow always.  She must wait till you come.  And when you come, it was\n’Here am I, your Jean Jacques.  Fall down and worship me.  I am your\nhusband.’  Did you ever say, ’Heavens, there you are, the woman of all\nthe world, the rising and the setting sun, the star that shines, the\ngarden where all the flowers of love grow’?  Did you ever do that?  But\nno, there was only one person in the world–there was only you, Jean\nJacques.  You were the only pig in the sty.”",
        "It was a bold stroke, but if Jean Jacques could stand that, he could\nstand anything.  There was a savage start on the part of Jean Jacques,\nand the lever almost moved.",
        "“Stop one second!” cried the master-carpenter, sharply now, for in spite\nof the sudden savagery on Jean Jacques’ part, he felt he had an\nadvantage, and now he would play his biggest card.",
        "“You can kill me.  It is there in your hand.  No one can stop you.  But\nwill that give you anything?  What is my life?  If you take it away, will\nyou be happier?  It is happiness you want.  Your wife–she will love you,\nif you give her a chance.  If you kill me, I will have my revenge in\ndeath, for it is the end of all things for you.  You lose your wife for\never.  You need not do so.  She would have gone with me, not because of\nme, but because I was a man who she thought would treat her like a\nfriend, like a comrade; who would love her–sacre, what husband could\nhelp make love to such a woman, unless he was in love with himself\ninstead of her!”",
        "Jean Jacques rocked to and fro over the lever in his agitation, yet he\nmade no motion to move it.  He was under a spell.",
        "Straight home drove the master-carpenter’s reasoning now.  “Kill me, and\nyou lose her for ever.  Kill me, and she will hate you.  You think she\nwill not find out?  Then see: as I die I will shriek out so loud that she\ncan hear me, and she will understand.  She will go mad, and give you over\nto the law.  And then–and then!  Did you ever think what will become of\nyour child, of your Zoe, if you go to the gallows?  That would be your\nlegacy and your blessing to her–the death of a murderer; and she would\nbe left alone with the woman that would hate you in death!  Voila–do you\nnot see?”",
        "Jean Jacques saw.  The terrific logic of the thing smote him.  His wife\nhating him, himself on the scaffold, his little Zoe disgraced and\ndishonoured all her life; and himself out of it all, unable to help her,\nand bringing irremediable trouble on her!  As a chemical clears a muddy\nliquid, leaving it pure and atomless, so there seemed to pass over Jean\nJacques’ face a thought like a revelation.",
        "He took his hand from the lever.  For a moment he stood like one awakened\nout of a sleep.  He put his hands to his eyes, then shook his head as\nthough to free it of some hateful burden.  An instant later he stooped,\nlifted up the ladder beside him, and let it down to the floor of the\nflume.",
        "“There, go–for ever,” he said.",
        "Then he turned away with bowed head.  He staggered as he stepped down\nfrom the bridge of the flume, where the lever was.  He swayed from side\nto side.  Then he raised his head and looked towards his house.  His\nchild lived there–his Zoe.",
        "“Moi je suis philosophe !” he said brokenly.",
        "After a moment or two, as he stumbled on, he said it again–\"Me, I am a\nphilosopher!”",
        "This much must be said for George Masson, that after the terrible\nincident at the flume he would have gone straight to the Manor Cartier\nto warn Carmen, if it had been possible, though perhaps she already knew.\nBut there was Jean Jacques on his way back to the Manor, and nothing\nremained but to proceed to Laplatte, and give the woman up for ever.  He\nhad no wish to pull up stakes again and begin life afresh, though he was\nonly forty, and he had plenty of initiative left.  But if he had to go,\nhe would want to go alone, as he had done before.  Yes, he would have\nliked to tell Carmen that Jean Jacques knew everything; but it was\nimpossible.  She would have to face the full shock from Jean Jacques’\nown battery.  But then again perhaps she knew already.  He hoped she did.",
        "At the very moment that Masson was thinking this, while he went to the\nmain road where he had left his horse and buggy tied up, Carmen came to\nknow.",
        "Carmen had not seen her husband that morning until now.  She had waked\nlate, and when she was dressed and went into the dining-room to look for\nhim, with an apprehension which was the reflection of the bad dreams of\nthe night, she found that he had had his breakfast earlier than usual and\nhad gone to the mill.  She also learned that he had eaten very little,\nand that he had sent a man into Vilray for something or other.  Try as\nshe would to stifle her anxiety, it obtruded itself, and she could eat no\nbreakfast.  She kept her eyes on the door and the window, watching for\nJean Jacques.",
        "Yet she reproved herself for her stupid concern, for Jean Jacques would\nhave spoken last night, if he had discovered anything.  He was not the\nman to hold his tongue when he had a chance of talking.  He would be sure\nto make the most of any opportunity for display of intellectual emotion,\nand he would have burst his buttons if he had known.  That was the way\nshe put it in a vernacular which was not Andalusian.  Such men love a\ngrievance, because it gives them an opportunity to talk–with a good case\nand to some point, not into the air at imaginary things, as she had so\noften seen Jean Jacques do.  She knew her Jean Jacques.  That is, she\nthought she knew her Jean Jacques after living with him for over thirteen\nyears; but hers was a very common mistake.  It is not time which gives\nrevelation, or which turns a character inside out, and exposes a new and\namazing, maybe revolting side to it.  She had never really seen Jean\nJacques, and he had never really seen himself, as he was, but only as\ncircumstances made him seem to be.  What he had showed of his nature all\nthese forty odd years was only the ferment of a more or less shallow\nlife, in spite of its many interests: but here now at last was life, with\nthe crust broken over a deep well of experience and tragedy.  She knew as\nlittle what he would do in such a case as he himself knew beforehand.  As\nthe incident of the flume just now showed, he knew little indeed, for he\nhad done exactly the opposite of what he meant to do.  It was possible\nthat Carmen would also do exactly the opposite of what she meant to do\nin her own crisis.",
        "Her test was to come.  Would she, after all, go off with the master-\ncarpenter, leaving behind her the pretty, clever, volatile Zoe.  .  .  .\nZoe–ah, where was Zoe?  Carmen became anxious about Zoe, she knew not\nwhy.  Was it the revival of the maternal instinct?",
        "She was told that Zoe had gone off on her pony to take a basket of good\nthings to a poor old woman down the river three miles away.  She would be\ngone all morning.  By so much, fate was favouring her; for the child’s\npresence would but heighten the emotion of her exit from that place where\nher youth had been wasted.  Already the few things she had meant to take\naway were secreted in a safe place some distance from the house, beside\nthe path she meant to take when she left Jean Jacques for ever.  George\nMasson wanted her, they were to meet to-day, and she was going–going\nsomewhere out of this intolerable dullness and discontent.",
        "When she pushed her coffee-cup aside and rose from the table without\neating, she went straight to her looking-glass and surveyed herself with\na searching eye.  Certainly she was young enough (she said to herself) to\ndraw the eyes of those who cared for youth and beauty.  There was not a\ngrey hair in the dark brown of her head, there was not a wrinkle–yes,\nthere were two at the corners of her mouth, which told the story of her\nrestlessness, of her hunger for the excitement of which she had been\ndeprived all these years.  To go back to Cadiz?–oh, anywhere, anywhere,\nso that her blood could beat faster; so that she could feel the stir of\nlife which had made her spirit flourish even in the dangers of the far-\noff day when Gonzales was by her side.",
        "She looked at her guitar.  She was sorry she could not take that away\nwith her.  But Jean Jacques would, no doubt, send it after her with his\ncurse.  She would love to play it once again with the old thrill; with\nthe thrill she had felt on the night of Zoe’s birthday a little while\nago, when she was back again with her lover and the birds in the gardens\nof Granada.  She would sing to someone who cared to hear her, and to\nsomeone who would make her care to sing, which was far more important.\nShe would sing to the master-carpenter.  Though he had not asked her to\ngo with him–only to meet in a secret place in the hills–she meant to do\nso, just as she once meant to marry Jean Jacques, and had done so.  It\nwas true she would probably not have married Jean Jacques, if it had not\nbeen for the wreck of the Antoine; but the wreck had occurred, and she\nhad married him, and that was done and over so far as she was concerned.\nShe had determined to go away with the master-carpenter, and though he\nmight feel the same hesitation as that which Jean Jacques had shown–she\nhad read her Norman aright aboard the Antoine–yet, still, George Masson\nshould take her away.  A catastrophe had thrown Jean Jacques into her\narms; it would not be a catastrophe which would throw the master-\ncarpenter into her arms.  It would be that they wanted each other.",
        "The mirror gave her a look of dominance–was it her regular features and\nher classic head?  Does beauty in itself express authority, just because\nit has the transcendent thing in it?  Does the perfect form convey\nsomething of the same thing that physical force–an army in arms, a\nbattleship–conveys?  In any case it was there, that inherent\nmasterfulness, though not in its highest form.  She was not an\naristocrat, she was no daughter of kings, no duchess of Castile, no\ndona of Segovia; and her beauty belonged to more primary manifestations;\nbut it was above the lower forms, even if it did not reach to the\nhighest.  “A handsome even splendid woman of her class” would have been\nthe judgment of the connoisseur.",
        "As she looked in the glass at her clear skin, at the wonderful throat\nshowing so soft and palpable and tower-like under the black velvet ribbon\nbrightened by a paste ornament; as she saw the smooth breadth of brow,\nthe fulness of the lips, the limpid lustre of the large eyes, the well-\ncurved ear, so small and so like ivory, it came home to her, as it had\nnever done before, that she was wasted in this obscure parish of St.\nSaviour’s.",
        "There was not a more restless soul or body in all the hemisphere than the\nsoul and body of Carmen Barbille, as she went from this to that on the\nmorning when Jean Jacques had refrained from killing the soul-disturber,\nthe master-carpenter, who had with such skill destroyed the walls and\nfoundations of his home.  Carmen was pointlessly busy as she watched for\nthe return of Jean Jacques.",
        "At last she saw him coming from the flume of the mill!  She saw that he\nstumbled as he walked, and that, every now and then, he lifted his head\nwith an effort and threw it back, and threw his shoulders back also, as\nthough to assert his physical manhood.  He wore no hat, his hands were\nmaking involuntary gestures of helplessness.  But presently he seemed to\nassert authority over his fumbling body and to come erect.  His hands\nclenched at his sides, his head came up stiffly and stayed, and with\nquickened footsteps he marched rigidly forward towards the Manor.",
        "Then she guessed at the truth, and as soon as she saw his face she was\nsure beyond peradventure that he knew.",
        "His figure darkened the doorway.  Her first thought was to turn and flee,\nnot because she was frightened of what he would do, but because she did\nnot wish to hear what he would say.  She shrank from the uprolling of the\ncurtain of the last thirteen years, from the grim exposure of the\nnakedness of their life together.  Her indolent nature in repose wanted\nthe dust of existence swept into a corner out of sight; yet when she was\nroused, and there were no corners into which the dust could be swept,\nshe could be as bold as any better woman.",
        "She hesitated till it was too late to go, and then as he entered the\nhouse from the staring sunlight and the peace of the morning, she\nstraightened herself, and a sulky, stubborn look came into her eyes.\nHe might try to kill her, but she had seen death in many forms far away\nin Spain, and she would not be afraid till there was cause.  Imagination\nwould not take away her courage.  She picked up a half-knitted stocking\nwhich lay upon the table, and standing there, while he came into the\nmiddle of the room, she began to ply the needles.",
        "He stood still.  Her face was bent over her knitting.  She did not look\nat him.",
        "“Well, why don’t you look at me?” he asked in a voice husky with\npassion.",
        "She raised her head and looked straight into his dark, distracted eyes.",
        "“Good morning,” she said calmly.",
        "A kind of snarling laugh came to his lips.  “I said good morning to my\nwife yesterday, but I will not say it to-day.  What is the use of saying\ngood morning, when the morning is not good!”",
        "“That’s logical, anyhow,” she said, her needles going faster now.  She\nwas getting control of them–and of herself.",
        "“Why isn’t the morning good?  Speak.  Why isn’t it good, Carmen?”",
        "“Quien sabe–who knows!” she replied with exasperating coolness.",
        "“I know–I know all; and it is enough for a lifetime,” he challenged.",
        "“What do you know–what is the ’all’?”  Her voice had lost timbre.  It\nwas suddenly weak, but from suspense and excitement rather than from\nfear.",
        "“I saw you last night with him, by the river.  I saw what you did.  I\nheard you say, ’Yes, to-morrow, for sure.’  I saw what you did.”",
        "Her eyes were busy with the knitting now.  She did not know what to say.\nThen, he had known all since the night before!  He knew it when he\npretended that his head ached–knew it as he lay by her side all night.\nHe knew it, and said nothing!  But what had he done–what had he done?\nShe waited for she knew not what.  George Masson was to come and inspect\nthe flume early that morning.  Had he come?  She had not seen him.  But\nthe river was flowing through the flume: she could hear the mill-wheel\nturning–she could hear the mill-wheel turning!",
        "As she did not speak, with a curious husky shrillness to his voice he\nsaid: “There he was down in the flume, there was I at the lever above,\nthere was the mill-wheel unlocked.  There it was.  I gripped the lever,\nand–”",
        "Her great eyes stared with horror.  The knitting-needles stopped;\na pallor swept across her face.  She felt as she did when she heard the\ncourt-martial sentence Carvillho Gonzales to death.",
        "The mill-wheel sounded louder and louder in her ears.",
        "“You let in the river!” she cried.  “You drove him into the wheel–you\nkilled him!”",
        "“What else was there to do?” he demanded.  “It had to be done, and it\nwas the safest way.  It would be an accident.  Such a thing might easily\nhappen.”",
        "“You have murdered him!” she gasped with a wild look.",
        "“To call it murder!” he sneered.  “Surely my wife would not call it\nmurder.”",
        "“Fiend–not to have the courage to fight him!” she flung back at him.\n\"To crawl like a snake and let loose a river on a man!  In any other\ncountry, he’d have been given a chance.”",
        "This was his act in a new light.  He had had only one idea in his mind\nwhen he planned the act, and that was punishment.  What rights had a man\nwho had stolen what was nearer and dearer than a man’s own flesh, and for\nwhich he would have given his own flesh fifty times?  Was it that Carmen\nwould now have him believe he ought to have fought the man, who had\nspoiled his life and ruined a woman’s whole existence.",
        "“What chance had I when he robbed me in the dark of what is worth fifty\ntimes my own life to me?” he asked savagely.",
        "“Murderer–murderer!” she cried hoarsely.  “You shall pay for this.”",
        "“You will tell–you will give me up?”",
        "Her eyes were on the mill and the river .  .  .  “Where–where is he?\nHas he gone down the river?  Did you kill him and let him go–like that!”",
        "She made a flinging gesture, as one would toss a stone.",
        "He stared at her.  He had never seen her face like that–so strained and\nhaggard.  George Masson was right when he said that she would give him\nup; that his life would be in danger, and that his child’s life would be\nspoiled.",
        "“Murderer!” she repeated.  “And when you go to the gallows, your child’s\nlife–you did not think of that, eh?  To have your revenge on the man who\nwas no more to blame than I, thinking only of yourself, you killed him;\nbut you did not think of your child.”",
        "Ah, yes, surely George Masson was right!  That was what he had said about\nhis child, Zoe.  What a good thing it was he had not killed the ravager\nof his home!",
        "But suddenly his logic came to his aid.  In terrible misery as he was, he\nwas almost pleased that he could reason.  “And you would give me over to\nthe law?  You would send me to the gallows–and spoil your child’s life?\"\nhe retorted.",
        "She threw the knitting down and flung her hands up.  “I have no husband.\nI have no child.  Take your life.  Take it.  I will go and find his\nbody,” she said, and she moved swiftly towards the door.  “He has gone\ndown the river–I will find him!”",
        "“He has gone up the river,” he exclaimed.  “Up the river, I say!”",
        "She stopped short and looked at him blankly.  Then his meaning became\nclear to her.",
        "“You did not kill him?” she asked scarce above a whisper.",
        "“I let him go,” he replied.",
        "“You did not fight him–why?”  There was scorn in her tone.",
        "“And if I had killed him that way?” he asked with terrible logic, as he\nthought.",
        "“There was little chance of that,” she replied scornfully, and steadied\nherself against a chair; for, now that the suspense was over, she felt as\nthough she had been passed between stones which ground the strength out\nof her.",
        "A flush of fierce resentment crossed over his face.  “It is not\neverything to be big,” he rejoined.  “The greatest men in the world have\nbeen small like me, but they have brought the giant things to their\nfeet.”",
        "She waved a hand disdainfully.  “What are you going to do now?” she\nasked.",
        "He drew himself up.  He seemed to rearrange the motions of his mind\nwith a little of the old vanity, which was at once grotesque and piteous.\n\"I am going to forgive you and to try to put things right,” he said.\n\"I have had my faults.  You were not to blame altogether.  I have left\nyou too much alone.  I did not understand everything all through.  I had\nnever studied women.  If I had I should have done the right thing always.\nI must begin to study women.”  The drawn look was going a little from his\nface, the ghastly pain was fading from his eyes; his heart was speaking\nfor her, while his vain intellect hunted the solution of his problem.",
        "She could scarcely believe her ears.  No Spaniard would ever have acted\nas this man was doing.  She had come from a land of No Forgiveness.\nCarvillho Gonzales would have killed her, if she had been untrue to him;\nand she would have expected it and understood it.",
        "But Jean Jacques was going to forgive her–going to study women, and so\nunderstand her and understand women, as he understood philosophy!  This\nwas too fantastic for human reason.  She stared at him, unable to say a\nword, and the distracted look in her face did not lessen.  Forgiveness\ndid not solve her problem.",
        "“I am going to take you to Montreal–and then out to Winnipeg, when I’ve\ngot the cheese-factory going,” he said with a wise look in his face, and\nwith tenderness even coming into his eyes.  “I know what mistakes I’ve\nmade\"–had not George Masson the despoiler told him of them?–\"and I know\nwhat a scoundrel that fellow is, and what tricks of the tongue he has.\nAlso he is as sleek to look at as a bull, and so he got a hold on you.\nI grasp things now.  Soon we will start away together again as we did at\nGaspe.”",
        "He came close to her.  “Carmen!” he said, and made as though he would\nembrace her.",
        "“Wait–wait a little.  Give me time to think,” she said with dry lips,\nher heart beating hard.  Then she added with a flattery which she knew\nwould tell, “I cannot think quick as you do.  I am slow.  I must have\ntime.  I want to work it all out.  Wait till to-night,” she urged.\n\"Then we can–”",
        "“Good, we will make it all up to-night,” he said, and he patted her\nshoulder as one would that of a child.  It had the slight flavour of the\nsuperior and the paternal.",
        "She almost shrank from his touch.  If he had kissed her she would have\nfelt that she must push him away; and yet she also knew how good a man he\nwas.",
        "“Well, what is it, M’sieu’ Fille?  What do you want with me?  I’ve got a\nlot to do before sundown, and it isn’t far off.  Out with it.”",
        "George Masson was in no good humour; from the look on the face of the\nlittle Clerk of the Court he had no idea that he would disclose any good\nnews.  It was probably some stupid business about “money not being paid\ninto the Court,” which had been left over from cases tried and lost;\nand he had had a number of cases that summer.  His head was not so clear\nto-day as usual, but he had had little difficulties with M’sieu’ Fille\nbefore, and he was sure that there was something wrong now.",
        "“Do you want to make me a present?” he added with humorous impatience,\nfor though he was not in a good temper, he liked the Clerk of the Court,\nwho was such a figure at Vilray.",
        "The opening for his purpose did not escape M. Fille.  He had been at a\nloss to begin, but here was a natural opportunity for him.",
        "“Well, good advice is not always a present, but I should like mine to be\ntaken as such, monsieur,” he said a little oracularly.",
        "“Oh, advice–to give me advice–that’s why you’ve brought me in here,\nwhen I’ve so much to do I can’t breathe!  Time is money with me, old\n’un.”",
        "“Mine is advice which may be money in your pocket, monsieur,” remarked\nthe Clerk of the Court with meaning.  “Money saved is money earned.\"\n\"How do you mean to save me money–by getting the Judge to give decisions\nin my favour?  That would be money in my pocket for sure.  The Court has\nbeen running against my interests this year.  When I think I was never so\nright in my life–bang goes the judgment of the Court against me, and\ninto my pocket goes my hand.  I don’t only need to save money, I need to\nmake it; so if you can help me in that way I’m your man, M’sieu’ la\nFillette?”",
        "The little man bristled at the misuse of his name, and he flushed\nslightly also; but there was always something engaging in the pleasure-\nloving master-carpenter.  He had such an eloquent and warm temperament,\nthe atmosphere of his personality was so genial, that his impertinence\nwas insulated.  Certainly the master-carpenter was not unpopular, and\npeople could not easily resist the grip of his physical influence, while\nmentally he was far indeed from being deficient.  He looked as little\nlike a villain as a man could, and yet–and yet–a nature like that of\nGeorge Masson (even the little Clerk could see that) was not capable of\nbeing true beyond the minute in which he took his oath of fidelity.\nWhile the fit of willingness was on him he would be true; yet in reality\nthere was no truth at all–only self-indulgence unmarked by duty or\nhonour.",
        "“Give me a judgment for defamation of character.  Give me a thousand\ndollars or so for that, m’sieu’, and you’ll do a good turn to a deserving\nfellow-citizen and admirer–one little thousand, that’s all, m’sieu’.\nThen I’ll dance at your wedding and weep at your tomb–so there!”",
        "How easy he made the way for the little Clerk of the Court!  “Defamation\nof character\"–could there possibly be a better opening for what he had\npromised Judge Carcasson he would say!",
        "“Ah, Monsieur Masson,” very officially and decorously replied M. Fille,\n\"but is it defamation of character?  If the thing is true, then what is\nthe judgment?  It goes against you–so there!”  There was irony in the\nlast words.",
        "“If what thing is true?” sharply asked the mastercarpenter, catching at\nthe fringe of the idea in M. Fille’s mind.  “What thing?”",
        "“Ah, but it is true, for I saw it!  Yes, alas!  I saw it with my own\neyes.  By accident of course; but there it was–absolute, uncompromising,\ndeadly and complete.”",
        "It was a happy moment for the little Clerk of the Court when he could, in\nsuch an impromptu way, coin a phrase, or a set of adjectives, which would\nbear inspection of purists of the language.  He loved to talk, though he\ndid not talk a great deal, but he made innumerable conversations in his\nmind, and that gave him facility when he did speak.  He had made\nconversations with George Masson in his mind since yesterday, when he\ngave his promise to Judge Carcasson; but none of them was like the real\nconversation now taking place.  It was all the impression of the moment,\nwhile the phrases in his mind had been wonderfully logical things which,\nfrom an intellectual standpoint, would have delighted the man whose cause\nhe was now engaged in defending.",
        "“You saw what, M’sieu’ la Fillette?  Out with it, and don’t use such big\nadjectives.  I’m only a carpenter.  ’Absolute, uncompromising, deadly,\ncomplete’–that’s a mouthful of grammar, my lords!  Come, my sprig of\njurisprudence, tell us what you saw.”  There was an apparent nervousness\nin Masson’s manner now.  Indeed he showed more agitation than when, a few\nhours before, Jean Jacques had stood with his hand on the lever of the\ngates of the flume, and the life of the master-carpenter at his feet, to\nbe kicked into eternity.",
        "“Four days ago at five o’clock in the afternoon\"–in a voice formal and\nexact, the little Clerk of the Court seemed to be reading from a paper,\nsince he kept his eyes fixed on the blotter before him, as he did in\nCourt–\"I was coming down the hill behind the Manor Cartier, when my\nattention–by accident–was drawn to a scene below me in the Manor.  I\nstopped short, of course, and–”",
        "“Diable!  You stopped short ’of course’ before what you saw!  Spit it\nout–what did you see?”  George Masson had had a trying day, and there\nwas danger of losing control of himself.  There was a whiteness growing\nround the eyes, and eating up the warmth of the cheek; his admirably\nsmooth brow was contracted into heavy wrinkles, and a foot shifted\nuneasily on the floor with a scraping sole.  This drew the attention of\nM. Fille, who raised his head reprovingly–he could not get rid of the\nfeeling that he was in court, and that a case was being tried; and the\nseverity of a Judge is naught compared with the severity of a Clerk of\nthe Court, particularly if he is small and unmarried, and has no one to\nbeat him into manageable humanity.",
        "M. Fille’s voice was almost querulous.",
        "“If you will but be patient, monsieur!  I saw a man with a woman in his\narms, and I fear that I must mention the name of the man.  It is not\nnecessary to give the name of the woman, but I have it written here\"–\nhe tapped the paper–\"and there is no mistake in the identity.  The man’s\nname is George Masson, master-carpenter, of the town of Laplatte in the\nprovince of Quebec.”",
        "George Masson was as one hit between the eyes.  He made a motion as\nthough to ward off a blow.  “Name of Peter, old cock!” he exclaimed\nabruptly.  “You saw enough certainly, if you saw that, and you needn’t\nmention the lady’s name, as you say.  The evidence is not merely\ncircumstantial.  You saw it with your own eyes, and you are an official\nof the Court, and have the ear of the Judge, and you look like a saint to\na jury.  Well for sure, I can’t prove defamation of character, as you\nsay.  But what then–what do you want?”",
        "“What I want I hope you may be able to grant without demur, monsieur.\nI want you to give your pledge on the Book\"–he laid his hand on a\nTestament lying on the table–\"that you will hold no further\ncommunication with the lady.”",
        "“Where do you come inhere?  What’s your standing in the business?\"\nMasson jerked out his words now.  The Clerk of the Court made a reproving\ngesture.  “Knowing what I did, what I had seen, it was clear that I must\napproach one or other of the parties concerned.  Out of regard for the\nlady I could not approach her husband, and so betray her; out of regard\nfor the husband I could not approach himself and destroy his peace; out\nof regard for all concerned I could not approach the lady’s father, for\nthen–”",
        "Masson interrupted with an oath.",
        "“That old reprobate of Cadiz–well no, bagosh!",
        "“And so you whisked me into your office with the talk of urgent business\nand–”",
        "“Is not the business urgent, monsieur?”",
        "“Not at all,” was the sharp reply of the culprit.",
        "“Monsieur, you shock me.  Do you consider that your conduct is not\ncriminal?  I have here\"–he placed his hand on a book–\"the Statutes of\nVictoria, and it lays down with wholesome severity the law concerning the\ntheft of the affection of a wife, with the accompanying penalty, going as\nhigh as twenty thousand dollars.”",
        "George Masson gasped.  Here was a new turn of affairs.  But he set his\nteeth.",
        "“Twenty thousand dollars–think of that!” he sneered angrily.",
        "“That is what I said, monsieur.  I said I could save you money, and money\nsaved is money earned.  I am your benefactor, if you will but permit me\nto be so, monsieur.  I would save you from the law, and from the damages\nwhich the law gives.  Can you not guess what would be given in a court of\nthe Catholic province of Quebec, against the violation of a good man’s\nhome?  Do you not see that the business is urgent?”",
        "“Not at all,” curtly replied the master-carpenter.  M. Fille bridled up,\nand his spare figure seemed to gain courage and dignity.",
        "“If you think I will hold my peace unless you give your sacred pledge,\nyou are mistaken, monsieur.  I am no meddler, but I have had much\nkindness at the hands of Monsieur and Madame Barbille, and I will do what\nI can to protect them and their daughter–that good and sweet daughter,\nfrom the machinations, corruptions and malfeasance–”",
        "“Three damn good words for the Court, bagosh!” exclaimed Masson with a\njeer.",
        "“No, with a man devoid of honour, I shall not hesitate, for the Manor\nCartier has been the home of domestic peace, and madame, who came to us a\nstranger, deserves well of the people of that ancient abode of chivalry-\nthe chivalry of France.”",
        "“When we are wound up, what a humming we can make!” laughed George\nMasson sourly.  “Have you quite finished, m’sieu’?”",
        "“The matter is urgent, you will admit, monsieur?” again demanded M.\nFille with austerity.",
        "“Not at all.”",
        "The master-carpenter was defiant and insolent, yet there was a devilish\nkind of humour in his tone as in his attitude.",
        "“You will not heed the warning I give?”  The little Clerk pointed to the\nopen page of the Victorian statutes before him.",
        "“Not at all.”",
        "“Then I shall, with profound regret–”",
        "Suddenly George Masson thrust his face forward near that of M. Fille, who\ndid not draw back.",
        "“You will inform the Court that the prisoner refuses to incriminate\nhimself, eh?” he interjected.",
        "“No, monsieur, I will inform Monsieur Barbille of what I saw.  I will do\nthis without delay.  It is the one thing left me to do.”",
        "In quite a grand kind of way he stood up and bowed, as though to dismiss\nhis visitor.",
        "As George Masson did not move, the other went to the door and opened it.\n\"It is the only thing left to do,” he repeated, as he made a gentle\ngesture of dismissal.",
        "“Not at all, my legal bombardier.  Not at all, I say.  All you know Jean\nJacques knows, and a good deal more–what he has seen with his own eyes,\nand understood with his own mind, without legal help.  So, you see,\nyou’ve kept me here talking when there’s no need and while my business\nwaits.  It is urgent, M’sieu’ la Fillette–your business is stale.  It\nbelongs to last session of the Court.”  He laughed at his joke.  “M’sieu’\nJean Jacques and I understand each other.”  He laughed grimly now.  “We\nknow each other like a book, and the Clerk of the Court couldn’t get in\nan adjective that would make the sense of it all clearer.”",
        "Slowly M. Fille shut the door, and very slowly he came back.  Almost\nblindly, as it might seem, and with a moan, he dropped into his chair.\nHis eyes fixed themselves on George Masson.",
        "“Ah–that!” he said helplessly.  “That!  The little Zoe–dear God, the\nlittle Zoe, and the poor madame!”  His voice was aching with pain and\nrepugnance.",
        "“If you were not such an icicle naturally, I’d be thinking your interest\nin the child was paternal,” said the master-carpenter roughly, for the\nvirtuous horror of the other’s face annoyed him.  He had had a vexing\nday.",
        "The Clerk of the Court was on his feet in a second.  “Monsieur, you\ndare!” he exclaimed.  “You dare to multiply your crimes in that shameless\nway.  Begone!  There are those who can make you respect decency.  I am\nnot without my friends, and we all stand by each other in our love of\nhome–of sacred home, monsieur.”",
        "There was something right in the master-carpenter at the bottom, with all\nhis villainy.  It was not alone that he knew there were fifty men in the\nParish of St. Saviour’s who would man-handle him for such a suggestion,\nand for what he had done at the Manor Cartier, if they were roused; but\nhe also had a sudden remorse for insulting the man who, after all, had\ntried to do him a service.  His amende was instant.",
        "“I take it back with humble apology–all I can hold in both hands,\nm’sieu’,” he said at once.  “I would not insult you so, much less Madame\nBarbille.  If she’d been like what I’ve hinted at, I wouldn’t have gone\nher way, for the promiscuous is not for me.  I’ll tell you the whole\ntruth of what happened to-day this morning.  Last night I met her at the\nriver, and–\"Then briefly he told all that had happened to the moment\nwhen Jean Jacques had left him at the flume with the words, “Moi, je suis\nphilosophe!”  And at the last he said:",
        "“I give you my word–my oath on this\"–he laid his hand on the Testament\non the table–\"that beyond what you saw, and what Jean Jacques saw, there\nhas been nothing.”  He held up a hand as though taking an oath.",
        "“Name of God, is it not enough what there has been?” whispered the\nlittle Clerk.",
        "“Oh, as you think, and as you say!  It is quite enough for me after to-\nday.  I’m a teetotaller, but I’m not so fond of water as to want to take\nmy eternal bath in it.”  He shuddered slightly.  “Bien sur, I’ve had my\nfill of the Manor Cartier for one day, my Clerk of the Court.”",
        "“Bien sur, it was enough to set you thinking, monsieur,” was the dry\ncomment of M. Fille, who was now recovering his composure.",
        "At that moment there came a knock at the door, and another followed\nquickly; then there entered without waiting for a reply–Carmen Barbille.",
        "The Clerk of the Court came to his feet with a startled “Merci!” and the\nmaster-carpenter fell back with a smothered exclamation.  Both men stared\nconfusedly at the woman as she shut the door slowly and, as it might\nseem, carefully, before she faced them.",
        "“Here I am, George,” she said, her face alive with vital adventure.",
        "His face was instantly swept by a storm of feeling for her, his nature\nresponded to the sound of her voice and the passion of her face.",
        "“Carmen–ah !” he said, and took a step forward, then stopped.  The\nhoarse feeling in his voice made her eyes flash gratitude and triumph,\nand she waited for him to take her in his arms; but she suddenly\nremembered M. Fille.  She turned to him.",
        "“I am sorry to intrude, m’sieu’,” she said.  “I beg your pardon.  They\ntold me at the office of avocat Prideaux that M’sieu’ Masson was here.\nSo I came; but be sure I would not interrupt you if there was not cause.”",
        "M. Fille came forward and took her hand respectfully.  “Madame, it is the\nfirst time you have honoured me here.  I am very glad to receive you.\nMonsieur and Mademoiselle Zoe, they are with you?  They will also come in\nperhaps?”",
        "M. Fille was courteous and kind, yet he felt that a duty was devolving on\nhim, imposed by his superior officer, Judge Carcasson, and by his own\nconscience, and with courage he faced the field of trouble which his\nsimple question opened up.  George Masson had but now said there had been\nnothing more than he himself had seen from the hill behind the Manor; and\nhe had further said, in effect, that all was ended between Carmen\nBarbille and himself; yet here they were together, when they ought to be\na hundred miles apart for many a day.  Besides, there was the look in the\nwoman’s face, and that intense look also in the face of the master-\ncarpenter!  The Clerk of the Court, from sheer habit of his profession,\nwatched human faces as other people watch the weather, or the rise or\nfall in the price of wheat and potatoes.  He was an archaic little\nofficial, and apparently quite unsophisticated; yet there was hidden\nbehind his ascetic face a quiet astuteness which would have been a\nvaluable asset to a worldly-minded and ambitious man.  Besides, affection\nsharpens the wits.  Through it the hovering, protecting sense becomes\ninstinctive, and prescience takes on uncanny certainty.  He had a real\nand deep affection for Jean Jacques and his Carmen, and a deeper one\nstill for the child Zoe; and the danger to the home at the Manor Cartier\nnow became again as sharp as the knife of the guillotine.  His eyes ran\nfrom the woman to the man, and back again, and then with great courage he\nrepeated his question:",
        "“Monsieur and mademoiselle, they are well–they are with you, I hope,\nmadame?”",
        "She looked at him in the eyes without flinching, and on the instant she\nwas aware that he knew all, and that there had been talk with George\nMasson.  She knew the little man to be as good as ever can be, but she\nresented the fact that he knew.  It was clear George Masson had told him\n–else how could he know; unless, perhaps, all the world knew!",
        "“You know well enough that I have come alone, my friend,” she answered.\n\"It is no place for Zoe; and it is no place for my husband and him\ntogether “she made a motion of the head towards the mastercarpenter.\n\"Santa Maria, you know it very well indeed!”",
        "The Clerk of the Court bowed, but made no reply.  What was there to say\nto a remark like that!  It was clear that the problem must be worked out\nalone between these two people, though he was not quite sure what the\nproblem was.  The man had said the thing was over; but the woman had\ncome, and the look of both showed that it was not all over.",
        "What would the man do?  What was it the woman wished to do?  The master-\ncarpenter had said that Jean Jacques had spared him, and meant to forgive\nhis wife.  No doubt he had done so, for Jean Jacques was a man of\nsentiment and chivalry, and there was no proof that there had been\nanything more than a few mad caresses between the two misdemeanants; yet\nhere was the woman with the man for whom she had imperilled her future\nand that of her husband and child!",
        "As though Carmen understood what was going on in his mind, she said:\n\"Since you know everything, you can understand that I want a few words\nwith M’sieu’ George here alone.”",
        "“Madame, I beg of you,” the Clerk of the Court answered instantly, his\nvoice trembling a little–\"I beg that you will not be alone with him.  As\nI believe, your husband is willing to let bygones be bygones, and to\nbegin to-morrow as though there was no to-day.  In such case you should\nnot see Monsieur Masson here alone.  It is bad enough to see him here in\nthe office of the Clerk of the Court, but to see him alone–what would\nMonsieur Jean Jacques say?  Also, outside there in the street, if our\nneighbours should come to know of the trouble, what would they say?  I\nwish not to be tiresome, but as a friend, a true friend of your whole\nfamily, madame–yes, in spite of all, your whole family–I hope you will\nrealize that I must remain here.  I owe it to a past made happy by\nkindness which is to me like life itself.  Monsieur Masson, is it not\nso?” he added, turning to the master-carpenter.  More flushed and\nagitated than when he had faced Jean Jacques in the flume, the master-\ncarpenter said: “If she wants a few words-of farewell–alone with me, she\nmust have it, M’sieu’ Fille.  The other room–eh?  Outside there\"–he\njerked a finger towards the street–\"they won’t know that you are not\nwith us; and as for Jean Jacques, isn’t it possible for a Clerk of the\nCourt to stretch the truth a little?  Isn’t the Clerk of the Court a man\nas well as a mummy?  I’d do as much for you, little lawyer, any time.  A\nword to say farewell, you understand!”  He looked M. Fille squarely in\nthe eye.",
        "“If I had to answer M. Jean Jacques on such a matter–and so much at\nstake–”",
        "Masson interrupted.  “Well, if you like we’ll bind your eyes and put wads\nin your ears, and you can stay, so that you’ll have been in the room all\nthe time, and yet have heard and seen nothing at all.  How is that,\nm’sieu’?  It’s all right, isn’t it?”",
        "M. Fille stood petrified for a moment at the audacity of the proposition.\nFor him, the Clerk of the Court, to be blinded and made ridiculous with\nwads in his ears-impossible!",
        "“Grace of Heaven, I would prefer to lie!” he answered quickly.  “I will\ngo into the next room, but I beg that you be brief, monsieur and madame.\nYou owe it to yourselves and to the situation to be brief, and, if I may\nsay so, you owe it to me.  I am not a practised Ananias.”",
        "“As well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, m’sieu’,” returned Masson.",
        "“I must beg that you will make your farewells of a minute and no more,\"\nreplied the Clerk of the Court firmly.  He took out his watch.  “It is\nsix o’clock.  I will come again at three minutes past six.  That is long\nenough for any farewell–even on the gallows.”",
        "Not daring to look at the face of the woman, he softly disappeared into\nthe other room, and shut the door without a sound.",
        "“Too good for this world,” remarked the master-carpenter when the door\nclosed tight.  He said it after the disappearing figure and not to\nCarmen.  “I don’t suppose he ever kissed a real grown-up woman in his\nlife.  It would have shattered his frail little carcass if, if\"–he\nturned to his companion–\"if you had kissed him, Carmen.  He’s made of\ntissue-paper,–not tissue–and apple-jelly.  Yes, but a stiff little\nbackbone, too, or he’d not have faced me down.”",
        "Masson talked as though he were trying to gain time.  “He said three\nminutes,” she returned with a look of death in her face.  As George\nMasson had talked with the Clerk of the Court, she had come to see, in so\nfar as agitation would permit, that he was not the same as when he left\nher by the river the evening before.",
        "“There’s no time to waste,” she continued.  “You spoke of farewells–\ntwice you spoke, and three times he spoke of farewells between us.\nFarewells–farewells–George–!”",
        "With sudden emotion she held out her arms, and her face flushed with\npassion and longing.",
        "The tempest which shook her shook him also, and he swayed from side to\nside like an animal uncertain if the moment had come to try its strength\nwith its foe; and in truth the man was fighting with himself.  His\nmoments with Jean Jacques at the flume had expanded him in a curious kind\nof way.  His own arguments while he was fighting for his life had, in a\nway, convinced himself.  She was a rare creature, and she was alluring–\nmore alluring than she had ever been; for a tragic sense had made her\nthinner, had refined the boldness of her beauty, had given a wonderful\nlustre to her eyes; and suffering has its own attraction to the\ndegenerate.  But he, George Masson, had had a great shock, and he had\ncome out of the jaws of death by the skin of his teeth.  It had been the\nnearest thing he had ever known; for though once he had had a pistol\npointed at him, there was the chance that it might miss at half-a-dozen\nyards, while there was no chance of the lever of the flume going wrong;\nand water and a mill-wheel were as absolute as the rope of the gallows.",
        "In a sense he had saved himself by his cleverness, but if Jean Jacques\nhad not been just the man he was, he could not have saved himself.  It\ndid not occur to him that Jean Jacques had acted weakly.  He would not\nhave done what Jean Jacques had done, had Jean Jacques spoiled his home.\nHe would have sprung the lever; but he was not so mean as to despise Jean\nJacques because he had foregone his revenge.  This master-carpenter had\ncertain gifts, or he could not have caused so much trouble in the world.\nThere is a kind of subtlety necessary to allure or delude even the\nhumblest of women, if she is not naturally bad; and Masson had had\nexperiences with the humblest, and also with those a little higher up.\nThis much had to be said for him, that he did not think Jean Jacques\ncontemptible because he had been merciful, or degraded because he had\nchosen to forgive his wife.",
        "The sight of the woman, as she stood with arms outstretched, had made his\npulses pound in his veins, but the heat was suddenly chilled by the wave\nof tragedy which had passed over him.  When he had climbed out of the\nflume, and opened the lever for the river to rush through, he had felt as\nthough ice–cold liquid flowed in his veins, not blood; and all day he\nhad been like that.  He had moved much as one in a dream, and he had felt\nfor the first time in his life that he was not ready to bluff creation.\nHe had always faced things down, as long as it could be done; and when it\ncould not, he had retreated, with the comment that no man was wise who\ntook gruel when he needn’t.  He was now face to face with his greatest\nproblem.  One thing was clear–they must either part for ever, or go\ntogether, and part no more.  There could be no half measures.  She was\na remarkable woman in her way, with a will of her own, and a kind of\nmadness in her; and there could be no backing and filling.  They only\nhad three minutes to talk together alone, and two of them were up.",
        "Her arms were held out to him, but he stood still, and before the fire of\nher eyes his own eyes dropped.  “No, not yet!” he exclaimed.  “It’s been\na day–heaven and hell, what a day it’s been!  He had me like that!”  He\nopened and shut his hand with fierce, spasmodic strength.  “And he let me\ngo–oh, let me go like a fox out of a trap!  I’ve had enough for one day\n–blood of St. Peter, enough, enough!”",
        "The flame of desire in her eyes suddenly turned to fury.  “It is\nfarewell,  then,  that you wish,”  she said hoarsely.  “It is no more and\nfarewell then?  You said it to him\"–she pointed to the other room–\"you\nsaid it to Jean Jacques, and you say it to me–to me that’s given you all\nI have.  Ah, what a beast you are, George Masson!”",
        "“No, Carmen, you have not given me all.  If you had, there would be no\nfarewell.  I would stand by you to the end of life, if I had taken all.\"\nHe lied, but that does not matter here.",
        "“All–all!” she cried.  “What is all?  Is it but the one thing that the\nworld says must part husband and wife?  Caramba!  Is that all?  I have\ngiven everything–I have had your arms around me–”",
        "“Yes, the Clerk of the Court saw that,” he interrupted.  “He saw from the\nhill behind the Manor on Tuesday last.”",
        "There was a tap at the door of the other room; it slowly opened, and the\nfigure of the Clerk appeared.  “Two minutes–just two minutes more, old\ntrump!” said the master-carpenter, stretching out a hand.  “One minute\nwill be enough,” said Carmen, who was suffering the greatest humiliation\nwhich can come to a woman.",
        "The Clerk looked at them both, and he was content.  He saw that one\nminute would certainly be enough.  “Very well, monsieur and madame,” he\nsaid, and closed the door again.",
        "Carmen turned fiercely on the man.  “M. Fille saw, did he, from Mont\nViolet?  Well, when I came here I did not care who saw.  I only thought\nof you–that you wanted me, and that I wanted you.  What the world\nthought was nothing, if you were as when we parted last night.  .  .  .\nI could not face Jean Jacques’ forgiveness.  To stay there, feeling that\nI must be always grateful, that I must be humble, that I must pretend,\nthat I must kiss Jean Jacques, and lie in his arms, and go to mass and to\nconfession, and–”",
        "“There is the child, there is Zoe–”",
        "“Oh, it is you that preaches now–you that tempted me, that said I was\nwasted at the Manor; that the parish did not understand me; that Jean\nJacques did not know a jewel of price when he saw it–little did you\nthink of Zoe then!”",
        "He made a protesting gesture.  “Maybe so, Carmen, but I think now before\nit is too late.”",
        "“The child loves her father as she never loved me,” she declared.  “She\nis twelve years old.  She will soon be old enough to keep house for him,\nand then to marry–ah, before there is time to think she will marry!”",
        "“It would be better then for you to wait till she marries before–\nbefore–”",
        "“Before I go away with you!”  She gave a shrill, agonized laugh.  “So\nthat is the end of it all!  What did you think of my child when you\nforced your way into my life, when you made me think of you–ah, quel\nbete–what a coward and beast you are!”",
        "“No, I am not all coward, though I may be a beast,” he answered.\n\"I didn’t think of your child when I began to talk to you as I did.  I\nwas out for all I could get.  I was the hunter.  And you were the finest\nwoman that I’d ever met and talked with; you–”",
        "“Oh, stop lying!” she cried with a face suddenly grown white and cold.",
        "“It isn’t lying.  You’re the sort of woman to drive men mad.  I went mad,\nand I didn’t think of your child.  But this morning in the flume I saved\nmy life by thinking of her, and I saved your life, too, maybe, by\nthinking of her; and I owe her something.  I’m going to try to pay back\nby letting her keep her mother.  I never felt towards a woman as I’ve\nfelt towards you; and that’s why I want to make things not so bad for you\nas they might be.”",
        "In her bitter eagerness she took a step nearer to him.  “As things might\nbe, if you were the man you were yesterday, willing to throw up\neverything for me?”",
        "“Like that–if you put it so,” he answered.",
        "She walked slowly up to him, looking as though she would plunge a knife\ninto his heart.  “I wish Jean Jacques had opened the gates,” she said.\n\"It would have saved the hangman trouble.”",
        "Then suddenly, and with a cry, she raised her hand and struck him full in\nthe face with her fist.  At that instant came a tap at the door of the\nother room, and the Clerk of the Court appeared.  He saw the blow, and\ndrew back with an exclamation.",
        "Carmen turned to him.  “Farewell has been said, M’sieu’ Fille,” she\nremarked in a voice sombre with rage and despair, and she went to the\ndoor leading to the street.",
        "Masson had winced at the blow, but he remained silent.  He knew not what\nto say or do.",
        "M. Fille hastily followed Carmen to the door.  “You are going  home,\ndear madame?  Permit me  to accompany you,” he said gently.  “I have to\ndo business with Jean Jacques.”",
        "A hand upon his chest, she pushed him back.  “Where I go I’m going\nalone,” she said.  Opening the door she went out, but turning back again\nshe gave George Masson a look that he never forgot.  Then the door\nclosed.",
        "“Grace of God, she is not going home!” brokenly murmured the Clerk of\nthe Court.",
        "With a groan the master-carpenter started forward towards the door, but\nM. Fille stepped between, laid a hand on his arm, and stopped him.",

        "In the last note of the song applause came instantaneously, almost\nimpatiently, as it might seem.  With cries of “Encore!  Encore!” it\nlasted some time, while the happy singer looked around with frank\npleasure on the little group encircling her in the Manor Cartier.",
        "“Did you like it so much?” she asked in a general way, and not looking\nat any particular person.  A particular person, however, replied, and she\nhad addressed the question to him, although not looking at him.  He was\nthe Man from Outside, and he sat near the bright wood-fire; for though it\nwas almost June the night was cool and he was delicate.",
        "“Ah, but splendid, but splendid–it got into every corner of every one of\nus,” the Man from Outside responded, speaking his fluent French with a\nslight English accent, which had a pleasant piquancy–at least to the\nears of the pretty singer, Mdlle. Zoe Barbille.  He was a man of about\nthirty-three, clean-shaven, dark-haired, with an expression of\ncleverness; yet with an irresponsible something about him which M. Fille\nhad reflected upon with concern.  For this slim, eager, talkative, half-\ninvalid visitor to St. Saviour’s had of late shown a marked liking for\nthe presence and person of Zoe Barbille; and Zoe was as dear to M. Fille\nas though she were his own daughter.  He it was who, in sarcasm, had\nspoken of this young stranger as “The Man from Outside.”",
        "Ever since Zoe’s mother had vanished–alone–seven years before from the\nManor Cartier, or rather from his office at Vilray, M. Fille had been as\nmuch like a maiden aunt or a very elder brother to the Spanische’s\ndaughter as a man could be.  Of M. Fille’s influence over his daughter\nand her love of his companionship, Jean Jacques had no jealousy whatever.\nVery often indeed, when he felt incompetent to do for his child all that\nhe wished–philosophers are often stupid in human affairs–he thought it\nwas a blessing Zoe had a friend like M. Fille.  Since the terrible day\nwhen he found that his wife had gone from him–not with the master-\ncarpenter who only made his exit from Laplatte some years afterwards–he\nhad had no desire to have a woman at the Manor to fill her place, even as\nhousekeeper.  He had never swerved from that.  He had had a hard row to\nhoe, but he had hoed it with a will not affected by domestic accidents or\ninconveniences.  The one woman from outside whom he permitted to go and\ncome at will–and she did not come often, because she and M. Fille agreed\nit would be best not to do so–was the sister of the Cure.  To be sure\nthere was Seraphe Corniche, the old cook, but she was buried in her\nkitchen, and Jean Jacques treated her like a man.",
        "When Zoe was confirmed, and had come back from Montreal, having spent two\nyears in a convent there–the only time she had been away from her father\nin seven years–having had her education chiefly from a Catholic\n\"brother,” the situation developed in a new way.  Zoe at once became\nas conspicuous in the country-side as her father had been over so many\nyears.  She was fresh, volatile, without affectation or pride, and had\na temperament responsive to every phase of life’s simple interests.\nShe took the attention of the young men a little bit as her due, but yet\nwithout conceit.  The gallants had come about her like bees, for there\nwas Jean Jacques’ many businesses and his reputation for wealth; and\nthere was her own charm, concerning which there could be far less doubt\nthan about Jean Jacques’ magnificent solvency.",
        "Zoe had gone heart-whole and with no especial preference for any young\nman, until the particular person came, the Man from Outside.",
        "His name was Gerard Fynes, and his business was mumming.  He was a young\nlawyer turned actor, and he had lived in Montreal before he went on the\nstage.  He was English–that was a misfortune; he was an actor–that was\na greater misfortune, for it suggested vagabondage of morals as well as\nof profession; and he was a Protestant, which was the greatest misfortune\nof all.  But he was only at St. Saviour’s for his convalescence after a\nso-called attack of congestion of the lungs; and as he still had a slight\ncough and looked none too robust, and as, more than all, he was simple\nin his ways, enjoying the life of the parish with greater zest than the\nresidents, he found popularity.  Undoubtedly he had a taking way with\nhim.  He was lodging with Louis Charron, a small farmer and kinsman of\nJean Jacques, who sold whisky–\"white whisky\"–without a license.  It was\na Charron family habit to sell liquor illegally, and Louis pursued the\ncareer with all an amateur’s enthusiasm.  He had a sovereign balm for\n\"colds,” composed of camomile flowers, boneset, liquorice, pennyroyal and\ngentian root, which he sold to all comers; and it was not unnatural that\na visitor with weak lungs should lodge with him.",
        "Louis and his wife had only good things to say about Gerard Fynes; for\nthe young man lived their life as though he was born to it.  He ate the\nslap-jacks, the buttermilk-pop, the pork and beans, the Indian corn on\nthe cob, the pea-soup, and the bread baked in the roadside oven, with a\nrelish which was not all pretence; for indeed he was as primitive as he\nwas subtle.  He himself could not have told how much of him was true and\nhow much was make-believe.  But he was certainly lovable, and he was not\nbad by nature.  Since coming to St. Saviour’s he had been constant to one\nattraction, and he had not risked his chances with Zoe by response to the\nshy invitations of dark eyes, young and not so young, which met his own\nhere and there in the parish.",
        "Only M. Fille and Jean Jacques himself had feelings of real antagonism to\nhim.  Jean Jacques, though not naturally suspicious, had, however, seen\nan understanding look pass between his Zoe and this stranger–this\nProtestant English stranger from the outer world, to which Jean Jacques\nwent less frequently since his fruitless search for his vanished Carmen.\nThe Clerk of the Court saw that Jean Jacques had observed the intimate\nglances of the two young people, and their eyes met in understanding.  It\nwas just before Zoe had sung so charmingly, ’Oh, Who Will Walk the Wood\nWith Me’.",
        "At first after Carmen’s going Jean Jacques had found it hard to endure\nsinging in his house.  Zoe’s trilling was torture to him, though he had\nnever forbidden her to sing, and she had sung on to her heart’s content.\nBy a subtle instinct, however, and because of the unspoken sorrow in her\nown heart, she never sang the songs like ’La Manola’.  Never after the\nday Carmen went did Zoe speak of her mother to anyone at all.  It was\nworse than death; it was annihilation, so far as speech was concerned.\nThe world at large only knew that Carmen Barbille had run away, and that\neven Sebastian Dolores her father did not know where she was.  The old\nman had not heard from her, and he seldom visited at the Manor Cartier or\nsaw his grand-daughter.  His own career of late years had been marked by\nlong sojourns in Quebec, Montreal and even New York; yet he always came\nback to St. Saviour’s when he was penniless, and was there started afresh\nby Jean Jacques.  Some said that Carmen had gone back to Spain, but\nothers discredited that, for, if she had done so, certainly old Sebastian\nDolores would have gone also.  Others continued to insist that she had\ngone off with a man; but there was George Masson at Laplatte living\nalone, and never going twenty miles away from home, and he was the only\nperson under suspicion.  Others again averred that since her flight\nCarmen had become a loose woman in Montreal; but the New Cure came down\non that with a blow which no one was tempted to invite again.",
        "M. Savry’s method of punishing was of a kind to make men shrink.  If\nCarmen Barbille had become a loose woman in Montreal, how did any member\nof his flock know that it was the case?  What company had he kept in\nMontreal that he could say that?  Did he see the woman–or did he hear\nabout her?  And if he heard, what sort of company was he keeping when he\nwent to Montreal without his wife to hear such things?  That was final,\nand the slanderer was under a cloud for a time, by reason of the anger of\nhis own wife.  It was about this time that the good priest preached from\nthe text, “Judge not that ye be not judged,” and said that there were\nonly ten commandments on the tables of stone; but that the ten included\nall the commandments which the Church made for every man, and which every\nman, knowing his own weakness, must also make for himself.",
        "His flock understood, though they did refrain, every one, from looking\ntowards the place where Jean Jacques sat with Ma’m’selle–she was always\ncalled that, as though she was a great lady; or else she was called “the\nlittle Ma’m’selle Zoe,” even when she had grown almost as tall as her\nmother had been.",
        "Though no one looked towards the place where Jean Jacques and his\ndaughter sat when this sermon was preached, and although Zoe seemed not\nto apprehend personal reference in the priest’s words, when she reached\nhome, after talking to her father about casual things all the way, she\nflew to her room, and, locking the door, flung herself on her bed and\ncried till her body felt as though it had been beaten by rods.  Then\nshe suddenly got up and, from a drawer, took out two things–an old\nphotograph of her mother at the time of her marriage, and Carmen’s\nguitar, which she had made her own on the day after the flight, and had\nkept hidden ever since.  She lay on the bed with her cheek pressed to the\nguitar, and her eyes hungrily feeding on the face of a woman whose beauty\nbelonged to spheres other than where she had spent the thirteen years of\nher married life.",
        "Zoe had understood more even at the time of the crisis than they thought\nshe did, child though she was; and as the years had gone on she had\ngrasped the meaning of it all more clearly perhaps than anyone at all\nexcept her adored friends Judge Carcasson, at whose home she had visited\nin Montreal, and M. Fille.",
        "The thing last rumoured about her mother in the parish was that she had\nbecome an actress.  To this Zoe made no protest in her mind.  It was\nbetter than many other possibilities, and she fixed her mind on it, so\nsaving herself from other agonizing speculations.  In a fixed imagination\nlay safety.  In her soul she knew that, no matter what happened, her\nmother would never return to the Manor Cartier.",
        "The years had not deepened confidence between father and daughter.  A\nshadow hung between them.  They laughed and talked together, were even\nboisterous in their fun sometimes, and yet in the eyes of both was the\nforbidden thing–the deserted city into which they could not enter.  He\ncould not speak to the child of the shame of her mother; she could not\nspeak of that in him which had contributed to that mother’s shame–the\nneglect which existed to some degree in her own life with him.  This was\nchiefly so because his enterprises had grown to such a number and height,\nthat he seemed ever to be counting them, ever struggling to the height,\nwhile none of his ventures ever reached that state of success when it\n\"ran itself”, although as years passed men called him rich, and he spent\nand loaned money so freely that they called him the Money Master, or the\nMoney Man Wise, in deference to his philosophy.",
        "Zoe was not beautiful, but there was a wondrous charm in her deep brown\neyes and in the expression of her pretty, if irregular, features.\nSometimes her face seemed as small as that of a young child, and alive\nwith eerie fancies; and always behind her laughter was something which\ngot into her eyes, giving them a haunting melancholy.  She had no signs\nof hysteria, though now and then there came heart-breaking little\noutbursts of emotion which had this proof that they were not hysteria–\nthey were never seen by others.  They were sacred to her own solitude.\nWhile in Montreal she had tasted for the first time the joys of the\ntheatre, and had then secretly read numbers of plays, which she bought\nfrom an old bookseller, who was wise enough to choose them for her.  She\nbecame possessed of a love for the stage even before Gerard Fynes came\nupon the scene.  The beginning of it all was the rumour that her mother\nwas now an actress; yet the root-cause was far down in a temperament\nresponsive to all artistic things.",
        "The coming of the Man from Outside acted on the confined elements of her\nnature like the shutter of a camera.  It let in a world of light upon\nunexplored places, it set free elements of being which had not before\nbeen active.  She had been instantly drawn to Gerard Fynes.  He had the\ndistance from her own life which provoked interest, and in that distance\nwas the mother whom perhaps it was her duty to forget, yet for whom she\nhad a longing which grew greater as the years went on.",
        "Gerard Fynes could talk well, and his vivid pictures of his short play-\nacting career absorbed her; and all the time she was vigilant for some\nname, for the description of some actress which would seem to be a clue\nto the lost spirit of her life.  This clue never came, but before she\ngave up hope of it, the man had got nearer to her than any man had ever\ndone.",
        "After meeting him she awoke to the fact that there was a difference\nbetween men, that it was not the same thing to be young as to be old;\nthat the reason why she could kiss the old Judge and the little Clerk of\nthe Court, and not kiss, say, the young manager of the great lumber firm\nwho came every year for a fortnight’s fishing at St. Saviour’s, was one\nwhich had an understandable cause and was not a mere matter of individual\ntaste.  She had been good friends with this young manager, who was only\nthirty years of age, and was married, but when he had wanted to kiss her\non saying good-bye one recent summer, she had said, “Oh, no, oh, no, that\nwould spoil it all!”  Yet when he had asked her why, and what she meant,\nshe could not tell him.  She did not know; but by the end of the first\nweek after Gerard Fynes had been brought to the Manor Cartier by Louis\nCharron, she knew.",
        "She had then been suddenly awakened from mere girlhood.  Judge Carcasson\nsaw the difference in her on a half-hour’s visit as he passed westward,\nand he had said to M. Fille, “Who is the man, my keeper of the treasure?\"\nThe reply had been of such a sort that the Judge was startled:",
        "“Tut, tut,” he had exclaimed, “an actor–an actor once a lawyer!  That’s\nserious.  She’s at an age–and with a temperament like hers she’ll\nbelieve anything, if once her affections are roused.  She has a flair for\nthe romantic, for the thing that’s out of reach–the bird on the highest\nbranch, the bird in the sky beyond ours, the song that was lost before\ntime was, the light that never was on sea or land.  Why, damn it, damn it\nall, my Solon, here’s the beginning of a case in Court unless we can lay\nthe fellow by the heels!  How long is he here for?”",
        "When M. Fille had told him that he would stay for another month for\ncertain, and no doubt much longer, if there seemed a prospect of winning\nthe heiress of the Manor Cartier, the Judge gave a groan.",
        "“We must get him away, somehow,” he said.  “Where does he stay?”",
        "“At the house of Louis Charron,” was the reply.  “Louis Charron–isn’t\nhe the fellow that sells whisky without a license?”",
        "“It is so, monsieur.”",
        "The Judge moved his head from side to side like a bear in a cage.  “It is\nthat, is it, my Fille?  By the thumb of the devil, isn’t it time then\nthat Louis Charron was arrested for breaking the law?  Also how do we\nknow but that the interloping fellow Fynes is an agent for a whisky firm\nperhaps?  Couldn’t he, then, on suspicion, be arrested with–”",
        "The Clerk of the Court shook his head mournfully.  His Judge was surely\nbecoming childish in his old age.  He looked again closely at the great\nman, and saw a glimmer of moisture in the grey eyes.  It was clear that\nJudge Carcasson felt deeply the dangers of the crisis, and that the\nfutile outburst had merely been the agitated protest of the helpless.",
        "“The man is what he says he is–an actor; and it would be folly to arrest\nhim.  If our Zoe is really fond of him, it would only make a martyr of\nhim.”",
        "As he made this reply M. Fille looked furtively at the other–out of the\ncorner of his eye, as it were.  The reply of the Judge was impatient,\nalmost peevish and rough.  “Did you think I was in earnest, my\npunchinello?  Surely I don’t look so young as all that.  I am over sixty-\nfive, and am therefore mentally developed!”",
        "M. Fille was exactly sixty-five years of age, and the blow was a shrewd\none.  He drew himself up with rigid dignity.",
        "“You must feel sorry sometimes for those who suffered when your mind was\nundeveloped, monsieur,” he answered.  “You were a judge at forty-nine,\nand you defended poor prisoners for twenty years before that.”",
        "The Judge was conquered, and he was never the man to pretend he was not\nbeaten when he was.  He admired skill too much for that.  He squeezed M.\nFille’s arm and said:",
        "“I’ve been quick with my tongue myself, but I feel sure now, that it’s\nthrough long and close association with my Clerk of the Court.”",
        "“Ah, monsieur, you are so difficult to understand!” was the reply.\n\"I have known you all these years, and yet–”",
        "“And yet you did not know how much of the woman there was in me!  .  .  .\nBut yes, it is that.  It is that which I fear with our Zoe.  Women break\nout–they break out, and then there is the devil to pay.  Look at her\nmother.  She broke out.  It was not inevitable.  It was the curse of\nopportunity, the wrong thing popping up to drive her mad at the wrong\nmoment.  Had the wrong thing come at the right time for her, when she was\nquite sane, she would be yonder now with our philosopher.  Perhaps she\nwould not be contented if she were there, but she would be there; and as\ntime goes on, to be where we were in all things which concern the\naffections, that is the great matter.”",
        "“Ah, yes, ah, yes,” was the bright-eyed reply of that Clerk, “there is no\ndoubt of that!  My sister and I there, we are fifty years together, never\nwith the wrong thing at the wrong time, always the thing as it was,\nalways to be where we were.”",
        "The Judge shook his head.  “There is an eternity of difference, Fille,\nbetween the sister and brother and the husband and wife.  The sacredness\nof isolation is the thing which holds the brother and sister together.\nThe familiarity of–but never mind what it is that so often forces\nhusband and wife apart.  It is there, and it breaks out in rebellion as\nit did with the wife of Jean Jacques Barbille.  As she was a strong woman\nin her way, it spoiled her life, and his too when it broke out.”",
        "M. Fille’s face lighted with memory and feeling.  “Ah, a woman of\npowerful emotions, monsieur, that is so!  I think I never told you, but\nat the last, in my office, when she went, she struck George Masson in the\nface.  It was a blow that–but there it was; I have never liked to think\nof it.  When I do, I shudder.  She was a woman who might have been in\nother circumstances–but there!”",
        "The Judge suddenly stopped in his walk and faced round on his friend.\n\"Did you ever know, my Solon,” he said, “that it was not Jean Jacques who\nsaved Carmen at the wreck of the Antoine, but it was she who saved him;\nand yet she never breathed of it in all the years.  One who was saved\nfrom the Antoine told me of it.  Jean Jacques was going down.  Carmen\ngave him her piece of wreckage to hang on to, and swam ashore without\nhelp.  He never gave her the credit.  There was something big in the\nwoman, but it did not come out right.”",
        "M. Fille threw up his hands.  “Grace de Dieu, is it so that she saved\nJean Jacques?  Then he would not be here if it had not been for her?”",
        "“That is the obvious deduction, Maitre Fille,” replied the Judge.",
        "The Clerk of the Court seemed moved.  “He did not treat her ill.\nI know that he would take her back to-morrow if he could.  He has never\nforgotten.  I saw him weeping one day–it was where she used to sing to\nthe flax-beaters by the Beau Cheval.  I put my hand on his shoulder, and\nsaid, ’I know, I comprehend; but be a philosopher, Jean Jacques.’”",
        "“What did he say?” asked the Judge.",
        "“He drew himself up.  ’In my mind, in my soul, I am philosopher always,’\nhe said, ’but my eyes are the windows of my heart, m’sieu’.  They look\nout and see the sorrow of one I loved.  It is for her sorrow that I weep,\nnot for my own.  I have my child, I have money; the world says to me,\n\"How goes it, my friend?”  I have a home–a home; but where is she, and\nwhat does the world say to her?’”",
        "The Judge shook his head sadly.  “I used to think I knew life, but I come\nto the belief in the end that I know nothing.  Who could have guessed\nthat he would have spoken like that!”",
        "“He forgave her, monsieur.”",
        "The Judge nodded mournfully.  “Yes, yes, but I used to think it is such\nmen who forgive one day and kill the next.  You never can tell where they\nwill explode, philosophy or no philosophy.”",
        "The Judge was right.  After all the years that had passed since his wife\nhad left him, Jean Jacques did explode.  It was the night of his birthday\nparty at which was present the Man from Outside.  It was in the hour when\nhe first saw what the Clerk of the Court had seen some time before–the\nunderstanding between Zoe and Gerard Fynes.  It had never occurred to him\nthat there was any danger.  Zoe had been so indifferent to the young men\nof St. Saviour’s and beyond, had always been so much his friend and the\nfriend of those much older than himself, like Judge Carcasson and M.\nFille, that he had not yet thought of her electing to go and leave him\nalone.",
        "To leave him alone!  To be left alone–it had never become a possibility\nto his mind.  It did not break upon him with its full force all at once.\nHe first got the glimmer of it, then the glimmer grew to a glow, and the\nglow to a great red light, in which his brain became drunk, and all his\nphilosophy was burned up like wood-shavings in a fiery furnace.",
        "“Did you like it so much?”  Zoe had asked when her song was finished, and\nthe Man from Outside had replied, “Ah, but splendid, splendid!  It got\ninto every corner of every one of us.”",
        "“Into the senses–why not into the heart?  Songs are meant for the\nheart,” said Zoe.",
        "“Yes, yes, certainly,” was the young man’s reply, “but it depends upon\nthe song whether it touches the heart more than the senses.  Won’t you\nsing that perfect thing, ’La Claire Fontaine’?” he added, with eyes as\nbright as passion and the hectic fires of his lung-trouble could make\nthem.",
        "She nodded and was about to sing, for she loved the song, and it had been\nringing in her head all day; but at that point M. Fille rose, and with\nhis glass raised high–for at that moment Seraphe Corniche and another\ncarried round native wine and cider to the company–he said:",
        "“To Monsieur Jean Jacques Barbille, and his fifty years, good health–\nbonne sante!  This is his birthday.  To a hundred years for Jean\nJacques!”",
        "Instantly everyone was up with glass raised, and Zoe ran and threw her\narms round her father’s neck.  “Kiss me before you drink,” she said.",
        "With a touch almost solemn in its tenderness Jean Jacques drew her head\nto his shoulder and kissed her hair, then her forehead.  “My blessed one\n–my angel,” he whispered; but there was a look in his eyes which only M.\nFille had seen there before.  It was the look which had been in his eyes\nat the flax-beaters’ place by the river.",
        "“Sing–father, you must sing,” said Zoe, and motioned to the fiddler.\n\"Sing It’s Fifty Years,” she cried eagerly.  They all repeated her\nrequest, and he could but obey.",
        "Jean Jacques’ voice was rather rough, but he had some fine resonant notes\nin it, and presently, with eyes fastened on the distance, and with free\ngesture and much expression, he sang the first verse of the haunting\nballad of the man who had reached his fifty years:",
        "                   “Wherefore these flowers?\n                    This fete for me?\n                    Ah, no, it is not fifty years,\n                    Since in my eyes the light you see\n                    First shone upon life’s joys and tears!\n                    How fast the heedless days have flown\n                    Too late to wail the misspent hours,\n                    To mourn the vanished friends I’ve known,\n                    To kneel beside love’s ruined bowers.\n                    Ah, have I then seen fifty years,\n                    With all their joys and hopes and fears!”",
        "Through all the verses he ranged, his voice improving with each phrase,\ngrowing more resonant, till at last it rang out with a ragged richness\nwhich went home to the hearts of all.  He was possessed.  All at once he\nwas conscious that the beginning of the end of things was come for him;\nand that now, at fifty, in no sphere had he absolutely “arrived,” neither\nin home nor fortune, nor–but yes, there was one sphere of success; there\nwas his fatherhood.  There was his daughter, his wonderful Zoe.  He drew\nhis eyes from the distance, and saw that her ardent look was not towards\nhim, but towards one whom she had known but a few weeks.",
        "Suddenly he stopped in the middle of a verse, and broke forward with his\narms outstretched, laughing.  He felt that he must laugh, or he would\ncry; and that would be a humiliating thing to do.",
        "“Come, come, my friends, my children, enough of that!” he cried.  “We’ll\nhave no more maundering.  Fifty years–what are fifty years!  Think of\nMethuselah!  It’s summer in the world still, and it’s only spring at St.\nSaviour’s.  It’s the time of the first flowers.  Let’s dance–no, no,\nnever mind the Cure to-night!  He will not mind.  I’ll settle it with\nhim.  We’ll dance the gay quadrille.”",
        "He caught the hands of the two youngest girls present, and nodded at the\nfiddler, who at once began to tune his violin afresh.  One of the joyous\nyoung girls, however, began to plead with him.",
        "“Ah, no, let us dance, but at the last–not yet, M’sieu’ Jean Jacques!\nThere is Zoe’s song, we must have that, and then we must have charades.\nHere is M’sieu’ Fynes–he can make splendid charades for us.  Then the\ndance at the last–ah, yes, yes, M’sieu’ Jean Jacques!  Let it be like\nthat.  We all planned it, and though it is your birthday, it’s us are\nmaking the fete.”",
        "“As you will then, as you will, little ones,” Jean Jacques acquiesced\nwith a half-sigh; but he did not look at his daughter.  Somehow,\nsuddenly, a strange constraint possessed him where Zoe was concerned.\n\"Then let us have Zoe’s song; let us have ’La Claire Fontaine’,” cried\nthe black-eyed young madcap who held Jean Jacques’ arms.",
        "But Zoe interrupted.  “No, no,” she protested, “the singing spell is\nbroken.  We will have the song after the charades–after the charades.”",
        "“Good, good–after the charades!” they all cried, for there would be\ncharades like none which had ever been played before, with a real actor\nto help them, to carry them through as they did on the stage.  To them\nthe stage was compounded of mystery, gaiety and the forbidden.",
        "So, for the next half-hour they were all at the disposal of the Man from\nOutside, who worked as though it was a real stage, and they were real\nplayers, and there were great audiences to see them.  It was all quite\nwonderful, and it involved certain posings, attitudes, mimicry and\npantomime, for they were really ingenious charades.",
        "So it happened that Zoe’s fingers often came in touch with those of the\nstage-manager, that his hands touched her shoulders, that his cheek\nbrushed against her dark hair once, and that she had sensations never\nexperienced before.  Why was it that she thrilled when she came near to\nhim, that her whole body throbbed and her heart fluttered when their\nshoulders or arms touched?  Her childlike nature, with all its warmth and\nvibration of life, had never till now felt the stir of sex in its vital\nsense.  All men had in one way been the same to her; but now she realized\nthat there was a world-wide difference between her Judge Carcasson, her\nlittle Clerk of the Court, and this young man whose eyes drank hers.  She\nhad often been excited, even wildly agitated, had been like a sprite let\nloose in quiet ways; but that was mere spirit.  Here was body and senses\ntoo; here was her whole being alive to a music, which had an aching\nsweetness and a harmony coaxing every sense into delight.",
        "“To-morrow evening, by the flume, where the beechtrees are–come–at six.\nI want to speak with you.  Will you come?”",
        "Thus whispered the maker of this music of the senses, who directed the\ncharades, but who was also directing the course of another life than his\nown.",
        "“Yes, if I can,” was Zoe’s whispered reply, and the words shook as she\nsaid them; for she felt that their meeting in the beech-trees by the\nflume would be of consequence beyond imagination.",
        "Judge Carcasson had always said that Zoe had judgment beyond her years;\nM. Fille had remarked often that she had both prudence and shrewdness as\nwell as a sympathetic spirit; but M. Fille’s little whispering sister,\nwho could never be tempted away from her home to any house, to whom the\nmarket and the church were like pilgrimages to distant wilds, had said to\nher brother:",
        "“Wait, Armand–wait till Zoe is waked, and then prudence and wisdom will\nbe but accident.  If all goes well, you will see prudence and wisdom; but\nif it does not, you will see–ah, but just Zoe!”",
        "The now alert Jean Jacques had seen the whispering of the two, though he\ndid not know what had been said.  It was, however, something secret, and\nif it was secret, then it was–yes, it was love; and love between his\ndaughter and that waif of the world–the world of the stage–in which men\nand women were only grown-up children, and bad grown-up children at that\n–it was not to be endured.  One thing was sure, the man should come to\nthe Manor Cartier no more.  He would see to that to-morrow.  There would\nbe no faltering or paltering on his part.  His home had been shaken to\nits foundations once, and he was determined that it should not fall about\nhis ears a second time.  An Englishman, an actor, a Protestant, and a\nrenegade lawyer!  It was not to be endured.",
        "The charade now being played was the best of the evening.  One of the\nmadcap friends of Zoe was to be a singing-girl.  She was supposed to\ncarry a tambourine.  When her turn to enter came, with a look of mischief\nand a gay dancing step, she ran into the room.  In her hands was a\nguitar, not a tambourine.  When Zoe saw the guitar she gave a cry.",
        "“Where did you get that?” she asked in a low, shocked, indignant voice.",
        "“In your room–your bedroom,” was the half-frightened answer.  “I saw it\non the dresser, and I took it.”",
        "“Come, come, let’s get on with the charade,” urged the Man from Outside.",
        "On the instant’s pause, in which Zoe looked at her lover almost\ninvoluntarily, and without fully understanding what he said, someone else\nstarted forward with a smothered exclamation–of anger, of horror, of\ndismay.  It was Jean Jacques.  He was suddenly transformed.",
        "His eyes were darkened by hideous memory, his face alight with passion.\nHe caught from the girl’s hands the guitar–Carmen’s forgotten guitar\nwhich he had not seen for seven years–how well he knew it!  With both\nhands he broke it across his knee.  The strings, as they snapped, gave a\nshrill, wailing cry, like a voice stopped suddenly by death.  Stepping\njerkily to the fireplace he thrust it into the flame.",
        "“Ah, there!” he said savagely.  “There–there!”  When he turned round\nslowly again, his face–which he had never sought to control before he\nhad his great Accident seven years ago–was under his command.\nA strange, ironic-almost sardonic-smile was on his lips.",
        "“It’s in the play,” he said.",
        "“No, it’s not in the charade, Monsieur Barbille,” said the Man from\nOutside fretfully.",
        "“That is the way I read it, m’sieu’,” retorted Jean Jacques, and he made\na motion to the fiddler.",
        "“The dance!  The dance!” he exclaimed.",
        "But yet he looked little like a man who wished to dance, save upon a\ngrave.",
        "It is a bad thing to call down a crisis in the night-time.  A “scene” at\nmidnight is a savage enemy of ultimate understanding, and that Devil,\ncalled Estrangement, laughs as he observes the objects of his attention\nin conflict when the midnight candle burns.",
        "He should have been seized with a fit of remorse, however, at the sight\nhe saw in the Manor Cartier at midnight of the day when Jean Jacques\nBarbille had reached his fiftieth year.  There is nothing which, for\npathos and for tragedy, can compare with a struggle between the young\nand the old.",
        "The Devil of Estrangement when he sees it, may go away and indulge\nhimself in sleep; for there will be no sleep for those who, one young and\nthe other old, break their hearts on each other’s anvils, when the lights\nare low and it is long till morning.",
        "When Jean Jacques had broken the forgotten guitar which his daughter had\nretrieved from her mother’s life at the Manor Cartier (all else he had\nhad packed and stored away in the flour-mill out of sight) and thrown it\nin the fire, there had begun a revolt in the girl’s heart, founded on a\nsense of injustice, but which itself became injustice also; and that is a\ndark thing to come between those who love–even as parent and child.",
        "After her first exclamation of dismay and pain, Zoe had regained her\ncomposure, and during the rest of the evening she was full of feverish\ngaiety.  Indeed her spirits and playful hospitality made the evening a\nsuccess in spite of the skeleton at the feast.  Jean Jacques had also\nroused himself, and, when the dance began, he joined in with spirit,\nthough his face was worn and haggard even when lighted by his smile.  But\nthough the evening came to the conventional height of hilarity, there was\na note running through it which made even the youngest look at each\nother, as though to say, “Now, what’s going to happen next!”",
        "Three people at any rate knew that something was going to happen.  They\nwere Zoe, the Man from Outside and M. Fille.  Zoe had had more than one\nrevelation that night, and she felt again as she did one day, seven years\nbefore, when, coming home from over the hills, she had stepped into a\nhouse where Horror brooded as palpably as though it sat beside the fire,\nor hung above the family table.  She had felt something as soon as she\nhad entered the door that far-off day, though the house seemed empty.  It\nwas an emptiness which was filled with a torturing presence or torturing\npresenes.  It had stilled her young heart.  What was it?  She had learned\nthe truth soon enough.  Out of the sunset had come her father with a face\ntwisted with misery, and as she ran to him, he had caught her by both\nshoulders, looked through her eyes to something far beyond, and hoarsely\nsaid: “She is gone–gone from us!  She has run away from home!  Curse her\nbaptism–curse it, curse it!”",
        "Zoe could never forget these last words she had ever heard her father\nspeak of Carmen.  They were words which would make any Catholic shudder\nto hear.  It was a pity he had used them, for they made her think at last\nthat her mother had been treated with injustice.  This, in spite of the\nfact that in the days, now so far away, when her mother was with them she\nhad ever been nearer to her father, and that, after first childhood, she\nand her mother were not so close as they had been, when she went to sleep\nto the humming of a chanson of Cadiz.  Her own latent motherhood,\nhowever, kept stealing up out of the dim distances of childhood’s\nignorance and, with modesty and allusiveness, whispering knowledge in\nher ear.  So it was that now she looked back pensively to the years she\nhad spent within sight and sound of her handsome mother, and out of the\nhunger of her own spirit she had come to idealize her memory.  It was\ngood to have a loving father; but he was a man, and he was so busy just\nwhen she wanted–when she wanted she knew not what, but at least to go\nand lay her head on a heart that would understand what was her sorrow,\nher joy, or her longing.",
        "And now here at last was come Crisis, which showed its thunderous head in\nthe gay dance, and shook his war-locks in the fire, where her mother’s\nguitar had shrieked in its last agony.",
        "When all the guests had gone, when the bolts had been shot home, and old\nSeraphe Corniche had gone to bed, father and daughter came face to face.",
        "There was a moment’s pause, as the two looked at each other, and then Zoe\ncame up to Jean Jacques to kiss him good-night.  It was her way of facing\nthe issue.  Instinctively she knew that he would draw back, and that the\nstruggle would begin.  It might almost seem that she had invited it; for\nshe had let the Man from Outside hold her hand for far longer than\ncourtesy required, while her father looked on with fretful eyes–even\nwith a murmuring which was not a benediction.  Indeed, he had evaded\nshaking hands with his hated visitor by suddenly offering him a cigar,\nand then in the doorway itself handing a lighted match.",
        "“His eminence, Cardinal Christophe, gave these cigars to me when he\npassed through St. Saviour’s five years ago,” Jean Jacques had remarked\nloftily, “and I always smoke one on my birthday.  I am a good Catholic,\nand his eminence rested here for a whole day.”",
        "He had had a grim pleasure in avoiding the handshake, and in having the\nProtestant outsider smoke the Catholic cigar!  In his anger it seemed to\nhim that he had done something worthy almost of the Vatican, indeed of\nthe great Cardinal Christophe himself.  Even in his moments of crisis, in\nhis hours of real tragedy, in the times when he was shaken to the centre,\nJean Jacques fancied himself more than a little.  It was as the master-\ncarpenter had remarked seven years before, he was always involuntarily\nsaying, “Here I come–look at me.  I am Jean Jacques Barbille!”",
        "When Zoe reached out a hand to touch his arm, and raised her face as\nthough to kiss him good-night, Jean Jacques drew back.",
        "“Not yet, Zoe,” he said.  “There are some things–What is all this\nbetween you and that man?  .  .  .  I have seen.  You must not forget\nwho you are–the daughter of Jean Jacques Barbille, of the Manor Cartier,\nwhose name is known in the whole province, who was asked to stand for the\nlegislature.  You are Zoe Barbille–Mademoiselle Zoe Barbille.  We do not\nput on airs.  We are kind to our neighbours, but I am descended from the\nBaron of Beaugard.  I have a place–yes, a place in society; and it is\nfor you to respect it.  You comprehend?”",
        "Zoe flushed, but there was no hesitation whatever in her reply.  “I am\nwhat I have always been, and it is not my fault that I am the daughter of\nM. Jean Jacques Barbille!  I have never done anything which was not good\nenough for the Manor Cartier.”  She held her head firmly as she said it.",
        "Now Jean Jacques flushed, and he did hesitate in his reply.  He hated\nirony in anyone else, though he loved it in himself, when heaven gave him\ninspiration thereto.  He was in a state of tension, and was ready to\nbreak out, to be a force let loose–that is the way he would have\nexpressed it; and he was faced by a new spirit in his daughter which\nwould surely spring the mine, unless he secured peace by strategy.  He\nhad sense enough to feel the danger.",
        "He did not see, however, any course for diplomacy here, for she had given\nhim his cue in her last words.  As a pure logician he was bound to take\nit, though it might lead to drama of a kind painful to them both.",
        "“It is not good enough for the Manor Cartier that you go falling in love\nwith a nobody from nowhere,” he responded.",
        "“I am not falling in love,” she rejoined.",
        "“What did you mean, then, by looking at him as you did; by whispering\ntogether; by letting him hold your hand when he left, and him looking at\nyou as though he’d eat you up–without sugar!”",
        "“I said I was not falling in love,” she persisted, quietly, but with\ncharacteristic boldness.  “I am in love.”",
        "“You are in love with him–with that interloper!  Heaven of heavens, do\nyou speak the truth?  Answer me, Zoe Barbille.”",
        "She bridled.  “Certainly I will answer.  Did you think I would let a man\nlook at me as he did, that I would look at a man as I looked at him, that\nI would let him hold my hand as I did, if I did not love him?  Have you\never seen me do it before?”",
        "Her voice was even and quiet–as though she had made up her mind on a\ncourse, and meant to carry it through to the end.",
        "“No, I never saw you look at a man like that, and everything is as you\nsay, but–” his voice suddenly became uneven and higher–pitched and a\nlittle hoarse, “but he is English, he is an actor–only that; and he is a\nProtestant.”",
        "“Only that?” she asked, for the tone of his voice was such as one would\nuse in speaking of a toad or vermin, and she could not bear it.  “Is it a\ndisgrace to be any one of those things?”",
        "“The Barbilles have been here for two hundred years; they have been\nFrench Catholics since the time of\"–he was not quite sure–\"since the\ntime of Louis XI.,” he added at a venture, and then paused, overcome by\nhis own rashness.",
        "“Yes, that is a long time,” she said, “but what difference does it make?\nWe are just what we are now, and as if there never had been a Baron of\nBeaugard.  What is there against Gerard except that he is an actor, that\nhe is English, and that he is a Protestant?  Is there anything?”",
        "“Sacre, is it not enough?  An actor, what is that–to pretend to be\nsomeone else and not to be yourself!”",
        "“It would be better for a great many people to be someone else rather\nthan themselves–for nothing; and he does it for money.”",
        "“For money!  What money has he got?  You don’t know.  None of us know.\nBesides, he’s a Protestant, and he’s English, and that ends it.  There\nnever has been an Englishman or a Protestant in the Barbille family, and\nit shan’t begin at the Manor Cartier.”  Jean Jacques’ voice was rising in\nproportion as he perceived her quiet determination.  Here was something\nof the woman who had left him seven years ago–left this comfortable home\nof his to go to disgrace and exile, and God only knew what else!  Here in\nthis very room–yes, here where they now were, father and daughter, stood\nhusband and wife that morning when he had his hand on the lever prepared\nto destroy the man who had invaded his home; who had cast a blight upon\nit, which remained after all the years; after he had done all a man could\ndo to keep the home and the woman too.  The woman had gone; the home\nremained with his daughter in it, and now again there was a fight for\nhome and the woman.  Memory reproduced the picture of the mother standing\njust where the daughter now stood, Carmen quiet and well in hand, and\nhimself all shaken with weakness, and with all power gone out of him–\neven the power which rage and a murderous soul give.",
        "But yet this was different.  There was no such shame here as had fallen\non him seven years ago.  But there was a shame after its kind; and if it\nwere not averted, there was the end of the home, of the prestige, the\npride and the hope of “M’sieu’ Jean Jacques, philosophe.”",
        "“What shall not begin here at the Manor Cartier?” she asked with burning\ncheek.",
        "“The shame–it shall not begin here.”",
        "“What shame, father?”",
        "“Of marriage with a Protestant and an actor.”",
        "“You will not let me marry him?” she persisted stubbornly.",
        "Her words seemed to shake him all to pieces.  It was as though he was\ngoing through the older tragedy all over again.  It had possessed him\never since the sight of Carmen’s guitar had driven him mad three hours\nago.  He swayed to and fro, even as he did when his hand left the lever\nand he let the master-carpenter go free.  It was indeed a philosopher\nunder torture, a spirit rocking on its anchor.  Just now she had put into\nwords herself what, even in his fear, he had hoped had no place in her\nmind–marriage with the man.  He did not know this daughter of his very\nwell.  There was that in her which was far beyond his ken.  Thousands of\nmiles away in Spain it had origin, and the stream of tendency came down\nthrough long generations, by courses unknown to him.",
        "“Marry him–you want to marry him!” he gasped.  “You, my Zoe, want to\nmarry that tramp of a Protestant!”",
        "Her eyes blazed in anger.  Tramp–the man with the air of a young\nAlexander, with a voice like the low notes of the guitar thrown to the\nflames!  Tramp!",
        "“If I love him I ought to marry him,” she answered with a kind of\ncalmness, however, though all her body was quivering.  Suddenly she came\nclose to her father, a great sympathy welled up in her eyes, and her\nvoice shook.",
        "“I do not want to leave you, father, and I never meant to do so.  I never\nthought of it as possible; but now it is different.  I want to stay with\nyou; but I want to go with him too.”",
        "Presently as she seemed to weaken before him, he hardened.  “You can’t\nhave both,” he declared with as much sternness as was possible to him,\nand with a Norman wilfulness which was not strength.  “You shall not\nmarry an actor and a Protestant.  You shall not marry a man like that–\nnever–never–never.  If you do, you will never have a penny of mine,\nand I will never–”",
        "“Oh, hush–Mother of Heaven, hush!” she cried.  “You shall not put a\ncurse on me too.”",
        "“What curse?” he burst forth, passion shaking him.  “You cursed my\nmother’s baptism.  It would be a curse to be told that you would see me\nno more, that I should be no more part of this home.  There has been\nenough of that curse here.  .  .  .  Ah, why–why–” she added with a\nsudden rush of indignation, “why did you destroy the only thing I had\nof hers?  It was all that was left–her guitar.  I loved it so.”",
        "All at once, with a cry of pain, she turned and ran to the door–entering\non the staircase which led to her room.  In the doorway she turned.",
        "“I can’t help it.  I can’t help it, father.  I love him–but I love you\ntoo,” she cried.  “I don’t want to go–oh, I don’t want to go!  Why do\nyou–?” her voice choked; she did not finish the sentence; or if she did,\nhe could not hear.",
        "Then she opened the door wide, and disappeared into the darkness of the\nunlighted stairway, murmuring, “Pity–have pity on me, holy Mother,\nVierge Marie!”  Then the door closed behind her almost with a bang.",
        "After a moment of stupefied inaction Jean Jacques hurried over and threw\nopen the door she had closed.  “Zoe–little Zoe, come back and say good-\nnight,” he called.  But she did not hear, for, with a burst of crying,\nshe had hurried into her own room and shut and locked the door.",
        "It was a pity, a measureless pity, as Mary the Mother must have seen,\nif she could see mortal life at all, that Zoe did not hear him.  It might\nhave altered the future.  As it was, the Devil of Estrangement might well\nbe content with his night’s work.",
        "Vilray was having its market day, and everyone was either going to or\ncoming from market, or buying and selling in the little square by the\nCourt House.  It was the time when the fruits were coming in, when\nvegetables were in full yield, when fish from the Beau Cheval were to be\nhad in plenty–from mud-cats and suckers, pike and perch, to rock-bass,\nsturgeon and even maskinonge.  Also it was the time of year when butter\nand eggs, chickens and ducks were so cheap that it was a humiliation not\nto buy.  There were other things on sale also, not for eating and\ndrinking, but for wear and household use–from pots and pans to rag-\ncarpets and table-linen, from woollen yarn to pictures of the Virgin and\nlittle calvaries.",
        "These were side by side with dried apples, bottled fruits, jars of maple\nsyrup, and cordials of so generous and penetrating a nature that the\ncurrant and elderberry wine by which they were flanked were tipple for\nbabes beside them.  Indeed, when a man wanted to forget himself quickly\nhe drank one of these cordials, in preference to the white whisky so\ncommonly imbibed in the parishes.  But the cordials being expensive, they\nwere chiefly bought for festive occasions like a wedding, a funeral, a\nconfirmation, or the going away of some young man or young woman to the\nmonastery or the convent to forget the world.  Meanwhile, if these\nspiritual argonauts drank it, they were likely to forget the world on the\nway to their voluntary prisons.  It was very seldom that a man or woman\nbought the cordials for ordinary consumption, and when that was done, it\nwould almost make a parish talk!  Yet cordials of nice brown, of delicate\ngreen, of an enticing yellow colour, were here for sale at Vilray market\non the morning after the painful scene at the Manor Cartier between Zoe\nand her father.",
        "The market-place was full–fuller than it had been for many a day.  A\ngreat many people were come in as much to “make fete” as to buy and sell.\nIt was a saint’s day, and the bell of St. Monica’s had been ringing away\ncheerfully twice that morning.  To it the bell of the Court House had\nmade reply, for a big case was being tried in the court.  It was a river-\ndriving and lumber case for which many witnesses had been called; and\nthere were all kinds of stray people in the place–red-shirted river-\ndrivers, a black-coated Methodist minister from Chalfonte, clerks from\nlumber-firms, and foremen of lumber-yards; and among these was one who\ngreatly loved such a day as this when he could be free from work, and\ncelebrate himself!",
        "Other people might celebrate saints dead and gone, and drink to ’La\nPatrie’, and cry “Vive Napoleon!” or “Vive la Republique!” or “Vive la\nReine!” though this last toast of the Empire was none too common–but he\ncould only drink with real sincerity to the health of Sebastian Dolores,\nwhich was himself.  Sebastian Dolores was the pure anarchist, the most\ncomplete of monomaniacs.",
        "“Here comes the father of the Spanische,” remarked Mere Langlois, who\npresided over a heap of household necessities, chiefly dried fruits,\npreserves and pickles, as Sebastian Dolores appeared not far away.",
        "“Good-for-nothing villain!  I pity the poor priest that confesses him.”",
        "“Who is the Spanische?” asked a young woman from her own stall or stand\nvery near, as she involuntarily arranged her hair and adjusted her waist-\nbelt; for the rakish-looking reprobate, with the air of having been\nsomewhere, was making towards them; and she was young enough to care how\nshe looked when a man, who took notice, was near.  Her own husband had\nbeen a horse-doctor, farmer, and sportsman of a kind, and she herself was\nnow a farmer of a kind; and she had only resided in the parish during the\nthree years since she had been married to, and buried, Palass Poucette.",
        "Old Mere Langlois looked at her companion in merchanting irritably, then\nshe remembered that Virginie Poucette was a stranger, in a way, and was\ntherefore deserving of pity, and she said with compassionate patronage:\n\"Newcomer you–I’d forgotten.  Look you then, the Spanische was the wife\nof my third cousin, M’sieu’ Jean Jacques, and–”",
        "Virginie Poucette nodded, and the slight frown cleared from her low yet\nshapely forehead.  “Yes, yes, of course I know.  I’ve heard enough.  What\na fool she was, and M’sieu’ Jean Jacques so rich and kind and good-\nlooking!  So this is her father–well, well, well!”",
        "Palass Poucette’s widow leaned forward, and looked intently at Sebastian\nDolores, who had stopped near by, and facing a couple of barrels on which\nwere exposed some bottles of cordial and home-made wine.  He was\naddressing himself with cheerful words to the dame that owned the\nmerchandise.",
        "“I suppose you think it’s a pity Jean Jacques can’t get a divorce,\"\nsaid Mere Langlois, rather spitefully to Virginie, for she had her\nsex’s aversion to widows who had had their share of mankind, and were\nafterwards free to have someone else’s share as well.  But suddenly\nrepenting, for Virginie was a hard-working widow who had behaved very\nwell for an outsider–having come from Chalfonte beyond the Beau\nChevalshe added: “But if he was a Protestant and could get a divorce,\nand you did marry him, you’d make him have more sense than he’s got; for\nyou’ve a quiet sensible way, and you’ve worked hard since Palass Poucette\ndied.”",
        "“Where doesn’t he show sense, that M’sieu’ Jean Jacques?” the younger\nwoman asked.",
        "“Where?  Why, with his girl–with Ma’m’selle.”  “Everybody I ever heard\nspeaks well of Ma’m’selle Zoe,” returned the other warmly, for she had a\nvery generous mind and a truthful, sentimental heart.  Mere Langlois\nsniffed, and put her hands on her hips, for she had a daughter of her\nown; also she was a relation of Jean Jacques, and therefore resented in\none way the difference in their social position, while yet she plumed\nherself on being kin.",
        "“Then you’ll learn something now you never knew before,” she said.\n\"She’s been carrying on–there’s no other word for it–with an actor\nfellow–”",
        "“Yes, yes, I did hear about him–a Protestant and an Englishman.”",
        "“Well, then, why do you pretend you don’t know–only to hear me talk, is\nit?  Take my word, I’d teach cousin Zoe a lesson with all her education\nand her two years at the convent.  Wasn’t it enough that her mother\nshould spoil everything for Jean Jacques, and make the Manor Cartier a\nplace to point the finger at, without her bringing disgrace on the parish\ntoo!  What happened last night–didn’t I hear this morning before I had\nmy breakfast!  Didn’t I–”",
        "She then proceeded to describe the scene in which Jean Jacques had thrown\nthe wrecked guitar of his vanished spouse into the fire.  Before she had\nfinished, however, something occurred which swept them into another act\nof the famous history of Jean Jacques Barbille and his house.",
        "She had arrived at the point where Zoe had cried aloud in pain at her\nfather’s incendiary act, when there was a great stir at the Court House\ndoor which opened on the market-place, and vagrant cheers arose.  These\nwere presently followed by a more disciplined fusillade; which presently,\nin turn, was met by hisses and some raucous cries of resentment.  These\nincreased as a man appeared on the steps of the Court House, looked round\nfor a moment in a dazed kind of way, then seeing some friends below who\nwere swarming towards him, gave a ribald cry, and scrambled down the\nsteps towards them.",
        "He was the prisoner whose release had suddenly been secured by a piece of\nevidence which had come as a thunder-clap on judge and jury.  Immediately\nafter giving this remarkable evidence the witness–Sebastian Dolores–\nhad left the court-room.  He was now engaged in buying cordials in the\nmarket-place–in buying and drinking them; for he had pulled the cork out\nof a bottle filled with a rich yellow liquid, and had drained half the\nbottle at a gulp.  Presently he offered the remainder to a passing\ncarter, who made a gesture of contempt and passed on, for, to him, white\nwhisky was the only drink worth while.  Besides, he disliked Sebastian\nDolores.  Then, with a flourish, the Spaniard tendered the bottle to\nMadame Langlois and Palass Poucette’s widow, at whose corner of\nmerchandise he had now arrived.",
        "Surely there never was a more benign villain and perjurer in the world\nthan Sebastian Dolores!  His evidence, given a half-hour before, with\nevery sign of truthfulness, was false.  The man–Rocque Valescure–for\nwhom he gave it was no friend of his; but he owned a tavern called “The\nRed Eagle,” a few miles from the works where the Spaniard was employed;\nalso Rocque Valescure’s wife set a good table, and Sebastian Dolores was\na very liberal feeder; when he was not hungry he was always thirsty.  The\nappeasement of hunger and thirst was now become a problem to him, for his\nemployers at Beauharnais had given him a month’s notice because of\ncertain irregularities which had come to their knowledge.  Like a wise\nman Sebastian Dolores had said nothing about this abroad, but had\nenlarged his credit in every direction, and had then planned this piece\nof friendly perjury for Rocque Valescure, who was now descending the\nsteps of the Court House to the arms of his friends and amid the\nexecrations of his foes.  What the alleged crime was does not matter.\nIt has no vital significance in the history of Jean Jacques Barbille,\nthough it has its place as a swivel on which the future swung.",
        "Sebastian Dolores had saved Rocque Valescure from at least three years in\njail, and possibly a very heavy fine as well; and this service must have\nits due reward.  Something for nothing was not the motto of Sebastian\nDolores; and he confidently looked forward to having a home at “The Red\nEagle” and a banker in its landlord.  He was no longer certain that he\ncould rely on help from Jean Jacques, to whom he already owed so much.\nThat was why he wanted to make Rocque Valescure his debtor.  It was not\nhis way to perjure his soul for nothing.  He had done so in Spain–yet\nnot for nothing either.  He had saved his head, which was now doing\nuseful work for himself and for a needy fellow-creature.  No one could\ndoubt that he had helped a neighbour in great need, and had done it at\nsome expense to his own nerve and brain.  None but an expert could have\nlied as he had done in the witness-box.  Also he had upheld his lies with\na striking narrative of circumstantiality.  He made things fit in “like\nmortised blocks” as the Clerk of the Court said to Judge Carcasson, when\nthey discussed the infamy afterwards with clear conviction that it was\nperjury of a shameless kind; for one who would perjure himself to save a\nman from jail, would also swear a man into the gallows-rope.  But Judge\nCarcasson had not been able to charge the jury in that sense, for there\nwas no effective evidence to rebut the untruthful attestation of the\nSpaniard.  It had to be taken for what it was worth, since the\nprosecuting attorney could not shake it; and yet to the Court itself it\nwas manifestly false witness.",
        "Sebastian Dolores was too wise to throw himself into the arms of his\nreleased tavern-keeper here immediately after the trial, or to allow\nRocque Valescure a like indiscretion and luxury; for there was a strong\nlaw against perjury, and right well Sebastian Dolores knew that old Judge\nCarcasson would have little mercy on him, in spite of the fact that he\nwas the grandfather of Zoe Barbille.  The Judge would probably think that\nsafe custody for his wayward character would be the kindest thing he\ncould do for Zoe.  Therefore it was that Sebastian Dolores paid no\nattention to the progress of the released landlord of “The Red Eagle,\"\nthough, by a glance out of the corner of his eyes, he made sure that the\nfootsteps of liberated guilt were marching at a tangent from where he\nwas–even to the nearest tavern.",
        "It was enough for Dolores that he should watch the result of his good\ndeed from the isolated area where he now was, in the company of two\nvirtuous representatives of domesticity.  His time with liberated guilt\nwould come!  He chuckled to think how he had provided himself with a\nrefuge against his hour of trouble.  That very day he had left his\nemployment, meaning to return no more, securing his full wages through\nhaving suddenly become resentful and troublesome, neglectful–and\nimperative.  To avoid further unpleasantness the firm had paid him all\nhis wages; and he had straightway come to Vilray to earn his bed and\nboard by other means than through a pen, a ledger and a gift for figures.\nIt would not be a permanent security against the future, but it would\nsuffice for the moment.  It was a rest-place on the road.  If the worst\ncame to the worst, there was his grand-daughter and his dear son-in-law\nwhom he so seldom saw–blood was thicker than water, and he would see to\nit that it was not thinned by neglect.",
        "Meanwhile he ogled Palass Poucette’s widow with one eye, and talked\nsoftly with his tongue to Mere Langlois, as he importuned Madame to “Sip\nthe good cordial in the name of charity to all and malice towards none.”",
        "“You’re a bad man–you, and I want none of your cordials,” was Mere\nLanglois’s response.  “Malice towards none, indeed!  If you and the devil\nstarted business in the same street, you’d make him close up shop in a\nyear.  I’ve got your measure, for sure; I have you certain as an arm and\na pair of stirrups.”",
        "“I go about doing good–only good,” returned the old sinner with a leer\nat the young widow, whose fingers he managed to press unseen, as he swung\nthe little bottle of cordial before the eyes of Mere Langlois.  He was\nnot wholly surprised when Palass Poucette’s widow did not show abrupt\ndispleasure at his bold familiarity.",
        "A wild thought flashed into his mind.  Might there not be another refuge\nhere–here in Palass Poucette’s widow!  He was sixty-three, it was true,\nand she was only thirty-two; but for her to be an old man’s darling who\nhad no doubt been a young man’s slave, that would surely have its weight\nwith her.  Also she owned the farm where she lived; and she was pleasant\npasturage–that was the phrase he used in his own mind, even as his eye\nswept from Mere Langlois to hers in swift, hungry inquiry.",
        "He seemed in earnest when he spoke–but that was his way; it had done him\nservice often.  “I do good whenever it comes my way to do it,” he\ncontinued.  “I left my work this morning\"–he lied of course–\"and hired\na buggy to bring me over here, all at my own cost, to save a fellow-man.\nThere in the Court House he was sure of prison, with a wife and three\nsmall children weeping in ’The Red Eagle’; and there I come at great\nexpense and trouble to tell the truth–before all to tell the truth–and\nsave him and set him free.  Yonder he is in the tavern, the work of my\nhands, a gift to the world from an honest man with a good heart and a\nsense of justice.  But for me there would be a wife and three children in\nthe bondage of shame, sorrow, poverty and misery\"–his eyes again\nravished the brown eyes of Palass Poucette’s widow–\"and here again\nI drink to my own health and to that of all good people–with charity\nto all and malice towards none!”",
        "The little bottle of golden cordial was raised towards Mere Langlois.\nThe fingers of one hand, however, were again seeking those of the comely\nyoung widow who was half behind him, when he felt them caught\nspasmodically away.  Before he had time to turn round he heard a voice,\nsaying: “I should have thought that ’With malice to all and charity\ntowards none,’ was your motto, Dolores.”",
        "He knew that voice well enough.  He had always had a lurking fear that\nhe would hear it say something devastating to him, from the great chair\nwhere its owner sat and dispensed what justice a jury would permit him to\ndo.  That devastating something would be agony to one who loved liberty\nand freedom–had not that ever been his watchword, liberty and freedom to\ndo what he pleased in the world and with the world?  Yes, he well knew\nJudge Carcasson’s voice.  He would have recognized it in the dark–or\nunder the black cap.  “M’sieu’ le juge !” he said, even before he turned\nround and saw the faces of the tiny Judge and his Clerk of the Court.\nThere was a kind of quivering about his mouth, and a startled look in his\neyes as he faced the two.  But there was the widow of Palass Poucette,\nand, if he was to pursue and frequent her, something must be done to keep\nhim decently figured in her eye and mind.",
        "“It cost me three dollars to come here and save a man from jail to-day,\nm’sieu’ le juge,” he added firmly.  The Judge pressed the point of his\ncane against the stomach of the hypocrite and perjurer.  “If the Devil\nand you meet, he will take off his hat to you, my escaped anarchist\"–\nDolores started almost violently now–\"for you can teach him much, and\nAnanias was the merest aboriginal to you.  But we’ll get you–we’ll get\nyou, Dolores.  You saved that guilty fellow by a careful and remarkable\nperjury to-day.  In a long experience I have never seen a better\nperformance–have you, monsieur?” he added to M. Fille.",
        "“But once,” was the pointed and deliberate reply.  “Ah, when was that?\"\nasked Judge Carcasson, interested.",
        "“The year monsieur le juge was ill, and Judge Blaquiere took your place.\nIt was in Vilray at the Court House here.”",
        "“Ah–ah, and who was the phenomenon–the perfect liar?” asked the Judge\nwith the eagerness of the expert.",
        "“His name was Sebastian Dolores,” meditatively replied M. Fille.  “It was\neven a finer performance than that of to-day.”",
        "The Judge gave a little grunt of surprise.  “Twice, eh?” he asked.\n\"Yet this was good enough to break any record,” he added.  He fastened\nthe young widow’s eyes.  “Madame, you are young, and you have an eye of\nintelligence.  Be sure of this: you can protect yourself against almost\nanyone except a liar–eh, madame?” he added to Mere Langlois.  “I am\nsure your experience of life and your good sense–”",
        "“My good sense would make me think purgatory was hell if I saw him\"–\nshe nodded savagely at Dolores as she said it, for she had seen that last\neffort of his to take the fingers of Palass Poucette’s widow–\"if I saw\nhim there, m’sieu’ le juge.”",
        "“We’ll have you yet–we’ll have you yet, Dolores,” said the Judge, as the\nSpaniard prepared to move on.  But, as Dolores went, he again caught the\neyes of the young widow.",
        "This made him suddenly bold.  “’Thou shalt not bear false witness against\nthy neighbour,’–that is the commandment, is it not, m’sieu’ le juge?\nYou are doing against me what I didn’t do in Court to-day.  I saved a man\nfrom your malice.”",
        "The crook of the Judge’s cane caught the Spaniard’s arm, and held him\ngently.",
        "“You’re possessed of a devil, Dolores,” he said, “and I hope I’ll never\nhave to administer justice in your case.  I might be more man than judge.\nBut you will come to no good end.  You will certainly–”",
        "He got no further, for the attention of all was suddenly arrested by a\nwagon driving furiously round the corner of the Court House.  It was a\nred wagon.  In it was Jean Jacques Barbille.",
        "His face was white and set; his head was thrust forward, as though\nlooking at something far ahead of him; the pony stallions he was driving\nwere white with sweat, and he had an air of tragic helplessness and\npanic.",
        "Suddenly a child ran across the roadway in front of the ponies, and the\nwild cry of the mother roused Jean Jacques out of his agonized trance.\nHe sprang to his feet, wrenching the horses backward and aside with\ndeftness and presence of mind.  The margin of safety was not more than a\nfoot, but the child was saved.",
        "The philosopher of the Manor Cartier seemed to come out of a dream as men\nand women applauded, and cries arose of “Bravo, M’sieu’ Jean Jacques!”",
        "At any other time this would have made Jean Jacques nod and smile, or\nwave a hand, or exclaim in good fellowship.  Now, however, his eyes were\nfull of trouble, and the glassiness of the semi-trance leaving them, they\nshifted restlessly here and there.  Suddenly they fastened on the little\ngroup of which Judge Carcasson was the centre.  He had stopped his horses\nalmost beside them.",
        "“Ah!” he said, “ah!” as his eyes rested on the Judge.  “Ah!” he again\nexclaimed, as the glance ran from the Judge to Sebastian Dolores.  “Ah,\nmercy of God!” he added, in a voice which had both a low note and a high\nnote-deep misery and shrill protest in one.  Then he seemed to choke, and\nwords would not come, but he kept looking, looking at Sebastian Dolores,\nas though fascinated and tortured by the sight of him.",
        "“What is it, Jean Jacques?” asked the little Clerk of the Court gently,\ncoming forward and laying a hand on the steaming flank of a spent and\ntrembling pony.",
        "As though he could not withdraw his gaze from Sebastian Dolores, Jean\nJacques did not look at M. Fil1e; but he thrust out the long whip he\ncarried towards the father of his vanished Carmen and his Zoe’s\ngrandfather, and with the deliberation of one to whom speaking was like\nthe laceration of a nerve he said: “Zoe’s run away–gone–gone!”",
        "At that moment Louis Charron, his cousin, at whose house Gerard Fynes had\nlodged, came down the street galloping his horse.  Seeing the red wagon,\nhe made for it, and drew rein.",
        "“It’s no good, Jean Jacques,” he called.  “They’re married and gone to\nMontreal–married right under our noses by the Protestant minister at\nTerrebasse Junction.  I’ve got the telegram here from the stationmaster\nat Terrebasse.  .  .  .  Ah, the villain to steal away like that–only a\nchild–from her own father!  Here it is–the telegram.  But believe me,\nan actor, a Protestant and a foreigner–what a devil’s mess!”",
        "He waved the telegram towards Jean Jacques.",
        "“Did he owe you anything, Louis?” asked old Mere Langlois, whose\npractical mind was alert to find the material status of things.",
        "“Not a sou.  Well, but he was honest, I’ll say that for the rogue and\nseducer.”",
        "“Seducer–ah, God choke you with your own tongue!” cried Jean Jacques,\nturning on Louis Charron with a savage jerk of the whip he held.  “She is\nas pure–”",
        "“It is no marriage, of course!” squeaked a voice from the crowd.",
        "“It’ll be all right among the English, won’t it, monsieur le juge?\"\nasked the gentle widow of Palass Poucette, whom the scene seemed to rouse\nout of her natural shyness.",
        "“Most sure, madame, most sure,” answered the Judge.  “It will be all\nright among the English, and it is all right among the French so far as\nthe law is concerned.  As for the Church, that is another matter.  But–\nbut see,” he added addressing Louis Charron, “does the station-master say\nwhat place they took tickets for?”",
        "“Montreal and Winnipeg,” was the reply.  “Here it is in the telegram.\nWinnipeg–that’s as English as London.”",
        "“Winnipeg–a thousand miles!” moaned Jean Jacques.",
        "With the finality which the tickets for Winnipeg signified, the shrill\npanic emotion seemed to pass from him.  In its mumbling, deadening force\nit was like a sentence on a prisoner.",
        "As many eyes were on Sebastian Dolores as on Jean Jacques.  “It’s the bad\nblood that was in her,” said a farmer with a significant gesture towards\nSebastian Dolores.",
        "“A little bad blood let out would be a good thing,” remarked a truculent\nriver-driver, who had given evidence directly contrary to that given by\nSebastian Dolores in the trial just concluded.  There was a savage look\nin his eye.",
        "Sebastian Dolores heard, and he was not the man to invite trouble.  He\ncould do no good where he was, and he turned to leave the market-place;\nbut in doing so he sought the eye of Virginie Poucette, who, however,\nkept her face at an angle from him, as she saw Mere Langlois sharply\nwatching her.",
        "“Grandfather, mother and daughter, all of a piece!” said a spiteful\nwoman, as Sebastian Dolores passed her.  The look he gave her was not the\nsame as that he had given to Palass Poucette’s widow.  If it had been\ngiven by a Spanish inquisitor to a heretic, little hope would have\nremained in the heretic’s heart.  Yet there was a sad patient look on his\nface, as though he was a martyr.  He had no wish to be a martyr; but he\nhad a feeling that for want of other means of expressing their sympathy\nwith Jean Jacques, these rough people might tar and feather him at least;\nthough it was only his misfortune that those sprung from his loins had\nsuch adventurous spirits!",
        "Sebastian Dolores was not without a real instinct regarding things.  What\nwas in his mind was also passing through that of the river-driver and a\nfew of his friends, and they carefully watched the route he was taking.",
        "Jean Jacques prepared to depart.  He had ever loved to be the centre of a\npicture, but here was a time when to be in the centre was torture.  Eyes\nof morbid curiosity were looking at the open wounds of his heart-ragged\nwounds made by the shrapnel of tragedy and treachery, not the clean\nwounds got in a fair fight, easily healed.  For the moment at least the\nlittle egoist was a mere suffering soul–an epitome of shame, misery and\ndisappointment.  He must straightway flee the place where he was tied to\nthe stake of public curiosity and scorn.  He drew the reins tighter, and\nthe horses straightened to depart.  Then it was that old Judge Carcasson\nlaid a hand on his knee.",
        "“Come, come,” he said to the dejected and broken little man, “where is\nyour philosophy?”",
        "Jean Jacques looked at the Judge, as though with a new-born suspicion\nthat henceforth the world would laugh at him, and that Judge Carcasson\nwas setting the fashion; but seeing a pitying moisture in the other’s\neyes, he drew himself up, set his jaw, and calling on all the forces at\nhis command, he said:",
        "“Moi je suis philosophe!”",
        "His voice frayed a little on the last word, but his head was up now.\nThe Clerk of the Court would have asked to accompany him to the Manor\nCartier, but he was not sure that Jean Jacques would like it.  He had a\nfeeling that Jean Jacques would wish to have his dark hour alone.  So he\nremained silent, and Jean Jacques touched his horses with the whip.\nAfter starting, however, and having been followed for a hundred yards or\nso by the pitying murmurs and a few I-told-you-so’s and revilings for\nhaving married as he did, Jean Jacques stopped the ponies.  Standing up\nin the red wagon he looked round for someone whom, for a moment, he did\nnot see in the slowly shifting crowd.",
        "Philosophy was all very well, and he had courageously given his\nallegiance to it, or a formula of it, a moment before; but there was\nsomething deeper and rarer still in the little man’s soul.  His heart\nhungered for the two women who had been the joy and pride of his life,\neven when he had been lost in the business of the material world.  They\nwere more to him than he had ever known; they were parts of himself which\nhad slowly developed, as the features and characteristics of ancestors\ngradually emerge and are emphasized in a descendant as his years\nincrease.  Carmen and Zoe were more a part of himself now than they had\never been.",
        "They were gone, the living spirits of his home.  Anything that reminded\nhim of them, despite the pain of the reminder, was dear to him.  Love was\ngreater than the vengeful desire of injured human nature.  His eyes\nwandered over the people, over the market.  At last he saw what he was\nlooking for.  He called.  A man turned.  Jean Jacques beckoned to him.\nHe came eagerly, he hurried to the red wagon.",
        "“Come home with me,” said Jean Jacques.",
        "The words were addressed to Sebastian Dolores, who said to himself that\nthis was a refuge surer than “The Red Eagle,” or the home of the widow\nPoucette.  He climbed in beside Jean Jacques with a sigh of content.",
        "“Ah, but that–but that is the end of our philosopher,” said Judge\nCarcasson sadly to the Clerk of the Court, as with amazement he saw this\ncatastrophe.",
        "“Alas!  if I had only asked to go with him, as I wished to do!\"\nresponded M. Fille.  “There, but a minute ago, it was in my mind,” he\nadded with a look of pain.",
        "“You missed your chance, falterer,” said the Judge severely.  “If you\nhave a good thought, act on it–that is the golden rule.  You missed your\nchance.  It will never come again.  He has taken the wrong turning, our\nunhappy Jean Jacques.”",
        "“Monsieur–oh, monsieur, do not shut the door in the face of God like\nthat!” said the shocked little master of the law.  “Those two together\n–it may be only for a moment.”",
        "“Ah, no, my little owl, Jean Jacques will wind the boa-constrictor round\nhis neck like a collar, all for love of those he has lost,” answered the\nJudge with emotion; and he caught M. Fille’s arm in the companionship of\nsorrow.",
        "In silence these two watched the red wagon till it was out of sight.",
        "He hated irony in anyone else\nI said I was not falling in love–I am in love\nIf you have a good thought, act on it\nPhilosophers are often stupid in human affairs\nThe beginning of the end of things was come for him",
        "Judge Carcasson was right.  For a year after Zoe’s flight Jean Jacques\nwrapped Sebastian Dolores round his neck like a collar, and it choked him\nlike a boaconstrictor.  But not Sebastian Dolores alone did that.  When\nthings begin to go wrong in the life of a man whose hands have held too\nmany things, the disorder flutters through all the radii of his affairs,\nand presently they rattle away from the hub of his control.",
        "So it was with Jean Jacques.  To take his reprobate father-in-law to his\nlonely home would have brought him trouble in any case; but as things\nwere, the Spaniard became only the last straw which broke his camel’s\nback.  And what a burden his camel carried–flour-mill, saw-mill, ash-\nfactory, farms, a general store, lime-kilns, agency for lightning-rods\nand insurance, cattle-dealing, the project for the new cheese-factory,\nand money-lending!",
        "Money-lending?  It seemed strange that Jean Jacques should be able to\nlend money, since he himself had to borrow, and mortgage also, from time\nto time.  When things began to go really wrong with him financially, he\nmortgaged his farms, his flour-mill, and saw-mill, and then lent money on\nother mortgages.  This he did because he had always lent money, and it\nwas a habit so associated with his prestige, that he tied himself up in\nborrowing and lending and counter-mortgaging till, as the saying is, “a\nPhiladelphia lawyer” could not have unravelled his affairs without having\nbeen born again in the law.  That he was able to manipulate his tangled\naffairs, while keeping the confidence of those from whom he borrowed, and\nthe admiration of those to whom he lent, was evidence of his capacity.\n\"Genius of a kind” was what his biggest creditor called it later.",
        "After a personal visit to St. Saviour’s, this biggest creditor and\nfinancial potentate–M. Mornay–said that if Jean Jacques had been\nstarted right and trained right, he would have been a “general in the\nfinancial field, winning big battles.”",
        "M. Mornay chanced to be a friend of Judge Carcasson, and when he visited\nVilray he remembered that the Judge had spoken often of his humble but\nlearned friend, the Clerk of the Court, and of his sister.  So M. Mornay\nmade his way from the office of the firm of avocats whom he had\ninstructed in his affairs with Jean Jacques, to that of M. Fille.  Here\nhe was soon engaged in comment on the master-miller and philosopher.",
        "“He has had much trouble, and no doubt his affairs have suffered,\"\nremarked M. Fille cautiously, when the ice had been broken and the Big\nFinancier had referred casually to the difficulties among which Jean\nJacques was trying to maintain equilibrium; “but he is a man who can do\nthings too hard for other men.”",
        "The Big Financier lighted another cigar and blew away several clouds of\nsmoke before he said in reply, “Yes, I know he has had family trouble\nagain, but that is a year ago, and he has had a chance to get another\ngrip of things.”",
        "“He did not sit down and mope,” explained M. Fille.  “He was at work the\nnext day after his daughter’s flight just the same as before.  He is a\nman of great courage.  Misfortune does not paralyse him.”",
        "M. Mornay’s speech was of a kind which came in spurts, with pauses of\nthought between, and the pause now was longer than usual.",
        "“Paralysis–certainly not,” he said at last.  “Physical activity is one\nof the manifestations of mental, moral, and even physical shock and\ninjury.  I’ve seen a man with a bullet in him run a half-mile–anywhere;\nI’ve seen a man ripped up by a crosscut-saw hold himself together, and\nwalk–anywhere–till he dropped.  Physical and nervous activity is one of\nthe forms which shattered force takes.  I expect that your ’M’sieu’ Jean\nJacques’ has been busier this last year than ever before in his life.\nHe’d have to be; for a man who has as many irons in the fire as he has,\nmust keep running from bellows to bellows when misfortune starts to damp\nhim down.”",
        "The Clerk of the Court sighed.  He realized the significance of what his\nvisitor was saying.  Ever Since Zoe had gone, Jean Jacques had been for\never on the move, for ever making hay on which the sun did not shine.\nJean Jacques’ face these days was lined and changeful.  It looked\nunstable and tired–as though disturbing forces were working up to the\nsurface out of control.  The brown eyes, too, were far more restless than\nthey had ever been since the Antoine was wrecked, and their owner\nreturned with Carmen to the Manor Cartier.  But the new restlessness of\nthe eyes was different from the old.  That was a mobility impelled by an\nactive, inquisitive soul, trying to observe what was going on in the\nworld, and to make sure that its possessor was being seen by the world.\nThis activity was that of a mind essentially concerned to find how many\nways it could see for escape from a maze of things; while his vanity was\ntaking new forms.  It was always anxious to discover if the world was\ntrying to know how he was taking the blows of fate and fortune.  He had\nbeen determined that, whatever came, it should not see him paralysed or\nbroken.",
        "As M. Fille only nodded his head in sorrowful assent, the Big Financier\nbecame more explicit.  He was determined to lose nothing by Jean Jacques,\nand he was prepared to take instant action when it was required; but he\nwas also interested in the man who might have done really powerful things\nin the world, had he gone about them in the right way.",
        "“M. Barbille has had some lawsuits this year, is it not so?” he asked.",
        "“Two of importance, monsieur, and one is not yet decided,” answered M.\nFille.",
        "“He lost those suits of importance?”",
        "“That is so, monsieur.”",
        "“And they cost him six thousand dollars–and over?”  The Big Financier\nseemed to be pressing towards a point.",
        "“Something over that amount, monsieur.”",
        "“And he may lose the suit now before the Courts?”",
        "“Who can tell, monsieur!” vaguely commented the little learned official.",
        "M. Mornay was not to be evaded.  “Yes, yes, but the case as it stands–\nto you who are wise in experience of legal affairs, does it seem at all\na sure thing for him?”",
        "“I wish I could say it was, monsieur,” sadly answered the other.",
        "The Big Financier nodded vigorously.  “Exactly.  Nothing is so\nunproductive as the law.  It is expensive whether you win or lose, and it\nis murderously expensive when you do lose.  You will observe, I know,\nthat your Jean Jacques is a man who can only be killed once–eh?”",
        "“Monsieur?”  M. Fille really did not grasp this remark.",
        "M. Mornay’s voice became precise.  “I will explain.  He has never\ncreated; he has only developed what has been created.  He inherited much\nof what he has or has had.  His designs were always affected by the fact\nthat he had never built from the very bottom.  When he goes to pieces–”",
        "“Monsieur–to pieces!” exclaimed the Clerk of the Court painfully.",
        "“Well, put it another way.  If he is broken financially, he will never\ncome up again.  Not because of his age–I lost a second fortune at fifty,\nand have a third ready to lose at sixty–but because the primary\ninitiative won’t be in him.  He’ll say he has lost, and that there’s\nan end to it all.  His philosophy will come into play–just at the last.\nIt will help him in one way and harm him in another.”",
        "“Ah, then you know about his philosophy, monsieur?” queried M. Fille.\nWas Jean Jacques’ philosophy, after all, to be a real concrete asset of\nhis life sooner or later?",
        "The Big Financier smiled, and turned some coins over in his pocket rather\nloudly.  Presently he said: “The first time I ever saw him he treated me\nto a page of Descartes.  It cost him one per cent.  I always charge a man\nfor talking sentiment to me in business hours.  I had to listen to him,\nand he had to pay me for listening.  I’ve no doubt his general yearly\nexpenditure has been increased for the same reason–eh, Maitre Fille?  He\nhas done it with others–yes?”  M. Fille waved a hand in deprecation, and\nhis voice had a little acidity as he replied: “Ah, monsieur, what can we\npoor provincials do–any of us–in dealing with men like you, philosophy\nor no philosophy?  You get us between the upper and the nether mill\nstones.  You are cosmopolitan; M. Jean Jacques Barbille is a provincial;\nand you, because he has soul enough to forget business for a moment and\nto speak of things that matter more than money and business, you grind\nhim into powder.”",
        "M. Mornay shook his head and lighted his cigar again.  “There you are\nwrong, Maitre Fille.  It is bad policy to grind to powder, or grind at\nall, men out of whom you are making money.  It is better to keep them\nfrom between the upper and nether mill-stones.",
        "“I have done so with your Barbille.  I could give him such trouble as\nwould bring things crashing down upon him at once, if I wanted to be\nmerely vicious in getting my own; but that would make it impossible for\nme to meet at dinner my friend Judge Carcasson.  So, as long as I can,\nI will not press him.  But I tell you that the margin of safety on which\nhe is moving now is too narrow–scarce a foot-hold.  He has too much\nunder construction in the business of his life, and if one stone slips\nout, down may come the whole pile.  He has stopped building the cheese-\nfactory–that represents sheer loss.  The ash-factory is to close next\nweek, the saw-mill is only paying its way, and the flour-mill and the\nfarms, which have to sustain the call of his many interests, can’t stand\nthe drain.  Also, he has several people heavily indebted to him, and if\nthey go down–well, it depends on the soundness of the security he holds.\nIf they listened to him talk philosophy, encouraged him to do it, and\ntold him they liked it, when the bargain was being made, the chances are\nthe security is inadequate.”",
        "The Clerk of the Court bridled up.  “Monsieur, you are very hard on a man\nwho for twenty-five years has been a figure and a power in this part of\nthe province.  You sneer at one who has been a benefactor to the place\nwhere he lives; who has given with the right hand and the left; whose\nenterprise has been a source of profit to many; and who has got a savage\nreward for the acts of a blameless and generous life.  You know his\ntroubles, monsieur, and we who have seen him bear them with fortitude and\nChristian philosophy, we resent–”",
        "“You need resent nothing, Maitre Fille,” interrupted the Big Financier,\nnot unkindly.  “What I have said has been said to his friend and the\nfriend of my own great friend, Judge Carcasson; and I am only anxious\nthat he should be warned by someone whose opinions count with him; whom\nhe can trust–”",
        "“But, monsieur, alas!” broke in the Clerk of the Court, “that is the\ntrouble; he does not select those he can trust.  He is too confiding.\nHe believes those who flatter him, who impose on his good heart.\nIt has always been so.”",
        "“I judge it is so still in the case of Monsieur Dolores, his daughter’s\ngrandfather?” the Big Financier asked quizzically.",
        "“It is so, monsieur,” replied M. Fille.  “The loss of his daughter shook\nhim even more than the flight of his wife; and it is as though he could\nnot live without that scoundrel near him–a vicious man, who makes\ntrouble wherever he goes.  He was a cause of loss to M. Barbille years\nago when he managed the ash-factory; he is very dangerous to women–even\nnow he is a danger to the future of a young widow” (he meant the widow of\nPalass Poucette); “and he has caused a scandal by perjury as a witness,\nand by the consequences–but I need not speak of that here.  He will do\nJean Jacques great harm in the end, of that I am sure.  The very day\nMademoiselle Zoe left the Manor Cartier to marry the English actor, Jean\nJacques took that Spanish bad-lot to his home; and there he stays, and\nthe old friends go–the old friends go; and he does not seem to miss\nthem.”",
        "There was something like a sob in M. Fille’s voice.  He had loved Zoe\nin a way that in a mother would have meant martyrdom, if necessary,\nand in a father would have meant sacrifice when needed; and indeed he\nhad sacrificed both time and money to find Zoe.  He had even gone as far\nas Winnipeg on the chance of finding her, making that first big journey\nin the world, which was as much to him in all ways as a journey to Bagdad\nwould mean to most people of M. Mornay’s world.  Also he had spent money\nsince in corresponding with lawyers in the West whom he engaged to search\nfor her; but Zoe had never been found.  She had never written but one\nletter to Jean Jacques since her flight.  This letter said, in effect,\nthat she would come back when her husband was no longer “a beggar” as her\nfather had called him, and not till then.  It was written en route to\nWinnipeg, at the dictation of Gerard Fynes, who had a romantic view of\nlife and a mistaken pride, but some courage too–the courage of love.",
        "“He thinks his daughter will come back–yes?” asked M. Mornay.  “Once he\nsaid to me that he was sorry there was no lady to welcome me at the Manor\nCartier, but that he hoped his daughter would yet have the honour.  His\ntalk is quite spacious and lofty at times, as you know.”",
        "“So–that is so, monsieur .  .  .  Mademoiselle Zoe’s room is always\nready for her.  At time of Noel he sent cards to all the families of the\nparish who had been his friends, as from his daughter and himself; and\nwhen people came to visit at the Manor on New Year’s Day, he said to each\nand all that his daughter regretted she could not arrive in time from the\nWest to receive them; but that next year she would certainly have the\npleasure.”",
        "“Like the light in the window for the unreturning sailor,” somewhat\ncynically remarked the Big Financier.  “Did many come to the Manor on\nthat New Year’s Day?”",
        "“But yes, many, monsieur.  Some came from kindness, and some because they\nwere curious–”",
        "“And Monsieur Dolores?”",
        "The lips of the Clerk of the Court curled, “He went about with a manner\nas soft as that of a young cure.  Butter would not melt in his mouth.\nSome of the women were sorry for him, until they knew he had given one\nof Jean Jacques’ best bear-skin rugs to Madame Palass Poucette for a New\nYear’s gift.”",
        "The Big Financier laughed cheerfully.  “It’s an old way to popularity–\nbeing generous with other people’s money.  That is why I am here.  The\npeople that spend your Jean Jacques’ money will be spending mine too, if\nI don’t take care.”",
        "M. Fille noted the hard look which now settled in M. Mornay’s face, and\nit disturbed him.  He rose and leaned over the table towards his visitor\nanxiously.",
        "“Tell me, if you please, monsieur, is there any real and immediate danger\nof the financial collapse of Jean Jacques?”",
        "The other regarded M. Fille with a look of consideration.  He liked this\nClerk of the Court, but he liked Jean Jacques for the matter of that,\nand away now from the big financial arena where he usually worked, his\nnatural instincts had play.  He had come to St. Saviour’s with a bigger\nthing in his mind than Jean Jacques and his affairs; he had come on the\nmatter of a railway, and had taken Jean Jacques on the way, as it were.\nThe scheme for the railway looked very promising to him, and he was in\ngood humour; so that all he said about Jean Jacques was free from that\ngeneral irritation of spirit which has sacrificed many a small man on a\nbig man’s altar.  He saw the agitation he had caused, and he almost\nrepented of what he had already said; yet he had acted with a view to\ngetting M. Fille to warn Jean Jacques.",
        "“I repeat what I said,” he now replied.  “Monsieur Jean Jacques’ affairs\nare too nicely balanced.  A little shove one way or another and over goes\nthe whole caboose.  If anyone here has influence over him, it would be a\nkindness to use it.  That case before the Court of Appeal, for instance;\nhe’d be better advised to settle it, if there is still time.  One or two\nof the mortgages he holds ought to be foreclosed, so that he may get out\nof them all the law will let him.  He ought to pouch the money that’s\nowing him; he ought to shave away his insurance, his lightning-rod, and\nhis horsedealing business; and he ought to sell his farms and his store,\nand concentrate on the flour-mill and the saw-mill.  He has had his\nwarnings generally from my lawyers, but what he wants most is the gentle\nhand to lead him; and I should think that yours, M. Fille, is the hand\nthe Almighty would choose if He was concerned with what happens at St.\nSaviour’s and wanted an agent.”",
        "The Clerk of the Court blushed greatly.  This was a very big man\nindeed in the great commercial world, and flattery from him had unusual\nsignificance; but he threw out his hands with a gesture of helplessness,\nand said: “Monsieur, if I could be of use I would; but he has ceased to\nlisten to me; he–”",
        "He got no further, for there was a sharp knock at the street door of the\nouter office, and M. Fille hastened to the other room.  After a moment he\ncame back, a familiar voice following him.",
        "“It is Monsieur Barbille, monsieur,” M. Fille said quietly, but with\napprehensive eyes.",
        "“Well–he wants to see me?” asked M. Mornay.  “No, no, monsieur.\nIt would be better if he did not see you.  He is in some agitation.”",
        "“Fille!  Maitre Fille–be quick now,” called Jean Jacques’ voice from the\nother room.",
        "“What did I say, monsieur?” asked the Big Financier.  “The mind that’s\nreceived a blow must be moving–moving; the man with the many irons must\nbe flying from bellows to bellows!”",
        "“Come, come, there’s no time to lose,” came Jean Jacques’ voice again,\nand the handle of the door of their room turned.",
        "M. Fille’s hand caught the handle.  “Excuse me, Monsieur Barbille,\n–a minute please,” he persisted almost querulously.  “Be good enough to\nkeep your manners .  .  .  monsieur!” he added to the Financier, “if you\ndo not wish to speak with him, there is a door\"–he pointed–\"which will\nlet you into the side-street.”",
        "“What is his trouble?” asked M. Mornay.",
        "M. Fille hesitated, then said reflectively: “He has lost his case in the\nAppeal Court, monsieur; also, his cousin, Auguste Charron, who has been\nworking the Latouche farm, has flitted, leaving–”",
        "“Leaving Jean Jacques to pay unexpected debts?”",
        "“So, monsieur.”",
        "“Then I can be of no use, I fear,” remarked M. Mornay dryly.",
        "“Fille!  Fille !” came the voice of Jean Jacques insistently from the\nroom.",
        "“And so I will say au revoir, Monsieur Fille,” continued the Big\nFinancier.",
        "A moment later the great man was gone, and M. Fille was alone with the\nphilosopher of the Manor Cartier.",
        "“Well, well, why do you keep me waiting!  Who was it in there–anyone\nthat’s concerned with my affairs?” asked Jean Jacques.",
        "In these days he was sensitive when there was no cause, and he was\ncredulous where he ought to be suspicious.  The fact that the little man\nhad held the door against him made him sure that M. Fille had not wished\nhim to see the departed visitor.",
        "“Come, out with it–who was it making fresh trouble for me?” persisted\nJean Jacques.",
        "“No one making trouble for you, my friend,” answered the Clerk of the\nCourt, “but someone who was trying to do you a good turn.”",
        "“He must have been a stranger then,” returned Jean Jacques bitterly.\n\"Who was it?”",
        "M. Fille, after an instant’s further hesitation, told him.",
        "“Oh, him–M. Momay !” exclaimed Jean Jacques, with a look of relief, his\nface lighting.  “That’s a big man with a most capable and far-reaching\nmind.  He takes a thing in as the ocean mouths a river.  If I had had\nmen like that to deal with all my life, what a different ledger I’d be\nbalancing now!  Descartes, Kant, Voltaire, Rousseau, Hume, Hegel–he has\nan ear for them all.  That is the intellectual side of him; and in\nbusiness\"–he threw up a hand–\"there he views the landscape from the\nmountain-top.  He has vision, strategy, executive.  He is Napoleon and\nAnacreon in one.  He is of the builders on the one hand, of the\nIlluminati and the Encyclopedistes on the other.”",
        "Even the Clerk of the Court, with his circumscribed range of thought and\nexperience, in that moment saw Jean Jacques as he really was.  Here was a\nman whose house of life was beginning to sway from an earthquake; who had\nbeen smitten in several deadly ways, and was about to receive buffetings\nbeyond aught he had yet experienced, philosophizing on the tight-rope–\nBlondin and Plato in one.  Yet sardonically piteous as it was, the\nincident had shown Jean Jacques with the germ of something big in him.\nHe had recognized in M. Mornay, who could level him to the dust tomorrow\nfinancially, a master of the world’s affairs, a prospector of life’s\nfields, who would march fearlessly beyond the farthest frontiers into the\nunknown.  Jean Jacques’ admiration of the lion who could, and would, slay\nhim was the best tribute to his own character.",
        "M. Fille’s eyes moistened as he realized it; and he knew that nothing he\ncould say or do would make this man accommodate his actions to the hard\nrules of the business of life; he must for ever be applying to them\nconceptions of a half-developed mind.",
        "“Quite so, quite so, Jean Jacques,” M. Fille responded gently, “but\"\n–here came a firmer note to his voice, for he had taken to heart the\nlesson M. Mornay had taught him, and he was determined to do his duty now\nwhen the opportunity was in his hand–\"but you have got to deal with\nthings as they are; not as they might have been.  If you cannot have the\ngreat men you have to deal with the little men like me.  You have to\nprove yourself bigger than the rest of us by doing things better.  A man\ndoesn’t fail only because of others, but also because of himself.  You\nwere warned that the chances were all against you in the case that’s just\nbeen decided, yet you would go on; you were warned that your cousin,\nAuguste Charron, was in debt, and that his wife was mad to get away from\nthe farm and go West, yet you would take no notice.  Now he has gone, and\nyou have to pay, and your case has gone against you in the Appellate\nCourt besides.  .  .  .  I will tell you the truth, my friend, even if it\ncuts me to the heart.  You have not kept your judgment in hand; you have\ngone ahead like a bull at a gate; and you pay the price.  You listen to\nthose who flatter, and on those who would go through fire and water for\nyou, you turn your back–on those who would help you in your hour of\ntrouble, in your dark day.”",
        "Jean Jacques drew himself up with a gesture, impatient, masterful and\nforbidding.  “I have fought my fight alone in the dark day; I have not\nasked for any one’s help,” he answered.  “I have wept on no man’s\nshoulder.  I have been mauled by the claws of injury and shame, and I\nhave not flinched.  I have healed my own wounds, and I wear my scars\nwithout–”",
        "He stopped, for there came a sharp rat-tat-tat at the door which opened\ninto the street.  Somehow the commonplace, trivial interruption produced\non both a strange, even startling effect.  It suddenly produced in their\nminds a feeling of apprehension, as though there was whispered in their\nears, “Something is going to happen–beware!”",
        "Rat-tat-tat!  The two men looked at each other.  The same thought was in\nthe mind of both.  Jean Jacques clutched at his beard nervously, then\nwith an effort he controlled himself.  He took off his hat as though he\nwas about to greet some important person, or to receive sentence in a\ncourt.  Instinctively he felt the little book of philosophy which he\nalways carried now in his breast-pocket, as a pietist would finger his\nbeads in moments of fear or anxiety.  The Clerk of the Court passed his\nthin hand over his hair, as he was wont to do in court when the Judge\nbegan his charge to the Jury, and then with an action more impulsive than\nwas usual with him, he held out his hand, and Jean Jacques grasped it.\nSomething was bringing them together just when it seemed that, in the\nstorm of Jean Jacques’ indignation, they were about to fall apart.\nM. Fille’s eyes said as plainly as words could do, “Courage, my friend!”",
        "Rat-tat-tat!  Rat-tat-tat!  The knocking was sharp and imperative now.\nThe Clerk of the Court went quickly forward and threw open the door.",
        "There stepped inside the widow of Palass Poucette.  She had a letter in\nher hand.  “M’sieu’, pardon, if I intrude,” she said to M. Fille; “but I\nheard that M’sieu’ Jean Jacques was here.  I have news for him.”",
        "“News!” repeated Jean Jacques, and he looked like a man who was waiting\nfor what he feared to hear.  “They told me at the post-office that you\nwere here.  I got the letter only a quarter of an hour ago, and I thought\nI would go at once to the Manor Cartier and tell M’sieu’ Jean Jacques\nwhat the letter says.  I wanted to go to the Manor Cartier for something\nelse as well, but I will speak of that by and by.  It is the letter now.”",
        "She pulled off first one glove and then the other, still holding the\nletter, as though she was about to perform some ceremony.  “It was a good\nthing I found out that M’sieu’ Jean Jacques was here.  It saves a four-\nmile drive,” she remarked.",
        "“The news–ah, nom de Dieu, the slowness of the woman–like a river going\nuphill!” exclaimed Jean Jacques, who was finding it hard to still the\ntrembling of his limbs.",
        "The widow of Palass Poucette flushed, but she had some sense in her head,\nand she realized that Jean Jacques was a little unbalanced at the moment.\nIndeed, Jean Jacques was not so old that she would have found it\ndifficult to take a well-defined and warm interest in him, were\ncircumstances propitious.  She held out the letter to him at once.\n\"It is from my sister in the West–at Shilah,” she explained.  “There is\nnothing in it you can’t read, and most of it concerns you.”  Jean Jacques\ntook the letter, but he could not bring himself to read it, for Virginie\nPoucette’s manner was not suggestive of happy tidings.  After an\ninstant’s hesitation he handed the letter to M. Fille, who pressed\nhis lips with an air of determination, and put on his glasses.",
        "Jean Jacques saw the face of the Clerk of the Court flush and then turn\npale as he read the letter.  “There, be quick!” he said before M. Fille\nhad turned the first page.",
        "Then the widow of Palass Poucette came to him and, in a simple harmless\nway she had, free from coquetry or guile, stood beside him, took his hand\nand held it.  He seemed almost unconscious of her act, but his fingers\nconvulsively tightened on hers; while she reflected that here was one who\nneeded help sorely; here was a good, warm-hearted man on whom a woman\ncould empty out affection like rain and get a good harvest.  She really\nwas as simple as a child, was Virginie Poucette, and even in her\nacquaintance with Sebastian Dolores, there had only been working in her\nthe natural desire of a primitive woman to have a man saying that which\nwould keep alive in her the things that make her sing as she toils; and\ncertainly Virginie toiled late and early on her farm.  She really was\nconcerned for Jean Jacques.  Both wife and daughter had taken flight, and\nhe was alone and in trouble.  At this moment she felt she would like to\nbe a sister to him–she was young enough to be his daughter almost.  Her\nheart was kind.",
        "“Now!” said Jean Jacques at last, as the Clerk of the Court’s eyes\nreached the end of the last page.  “Now, speak!  It is–it is my Zoe?”",
        "“It is our Zoe,” answered M. Fille.",
        "“Figure de Christ, what do you wait for–she is not dead?” exclaimed\nJean Jacques with a courage which made him set his feet squarely.",
        "The Clerk of the Court shook his head and began.  “She is alive.\nMadame Poucette’s sister saw her by chance.  Zoe was on her way up the\nSaskatchewan River to the Peace River country with her husband.  Her\nhusband’s health was bad.  He had to leave the stage in the United States\nwhere he had gone after Winnipeg.  The doctors said he must live the\nopen-air life.  He and Zoe were going north, to take a farm somewhere.”",
        "“Somewhere!  Somewhere!” murmured Jean Jacques.  The farther away from\nJean Jacques the better–that is what she thinks.”",
        "“No, you are wrong, my friend,” rejoined M. Fille.  “She said to Madame\nPoucette’s sister\"–he held up the letter–\"that when they had proved\nthey could live without anybody’s help they would come back to see you.\nZoe thought that, having taken her life in her own hands, she ought to\njustify herself before she asked your forgiveness and a place at your\ntable.  She felt that you could only love her and be glad of her, if her\nman was independent of you.  It is a proud and sensitive soul–but there\nit is!”",
        "“It is romance, it is quixotism–ah, heart of God, what quixotism!\"\nexclaimed Jean Jacques.",
        "“She gets her romance and quixotism from Jean Jacques Barbille,” retorted\nthe Clerk of the Court.  “She does more feeling than thinking–like you.”",
        "Jean Jacques’ heart was bleeding, but he drew himself up proudly, and\ncaught his hand away from the warm palm of Poucette’s widow.  As his\naffairs crumbled his pride grew more insistent.  M. Fille had challenged\nhis intellect–his intellect!",
        "“My life has been a procession of practical things,” he declared\noracularly.  “I have been a man of business who designs.  I am no\ndreamer.  I think.  I act.  I suffer.  I have been the victim of romance,\nnot its interpreter.  Mercy of God, what has broken my life, what but\nromance–romance, first with one and then with another!  More feeling\nthan thinking, Maitre Fille–you say that?  Why the Barbilles have ever\nin the past built up life on a basis of thought and action, and I have\nadded philosophy–the science of thought and act.  Jean Jacques Barbille\nhas been the man of design and the man of action also.  Don Quixote was a\nfool, a dreamer, but Jean Jacques is no Don Quixote.  He is a man who has\ndone things, but also he is a man who has been broken on the wheel of\nlife.  He is a man whose heart-strings have been torn–”",
        "He had worked himself up into a fit of eloquence and revolt.  He was\ntouched by the rod of desperation, which makes the soul protest that it\nis right when it knows that it is wrong.",
        "Suddenly, breaking off his speech, he threw up his hands and made for the\ndoor.",
        "“I will fight it out alone!” he declared with rough emotion, and at the\ndoor he turned towards them again.  He looked at them both as though he\nwould dare them to contradict him.  The restless fire of his eyes seemed\nto dart from one to the other.",
        "“That’s the way it is,” said the widow of Palass Poucette coming quickly\nforward to him.  “It’s always the way.  We must fight our battles alone,\nbut we don’t have to bear the wounds alone.  In the battle you are alone,\nbut the hand to heal the wounds may be another’s.  You are a philosopher\n–well, what I speak is true, isn’t it?”",
        "Virginie had said the one thing which could have stayed the tide of Jean\nJacques’ pessimism and broken his cloud of gloom.  She appealed to him in\nthe tune of an old song.  The years and the curses of years had not\ndispelled the illusion that he was a philosopher.  He stopped with his\nhand on the door.",
        "“That’s so, without doubt that’s so,” he said.  “You have stumbled on a\ntruth of life, madame.”",
        "Suddenly there came into his look something of the yearning and hunger\nwhich the lonely and forsaken feel when they are not on the full tide of\ndoing.  It was as though he must have companionship, in spite of his\nbrave announcement that he must fight his fight alone.  He had been\nwounded in the battle, and here was one who held out the hand of healing\nto him.  Never since his wife had left him the long lonely years ago had\na woman meant anything to him except as one of a race; but in this moment\nhere a woman had held his hand, and he could feel still the warm palm\nwhich had comforted his own agitated fingers.",
        "Virginie Poucette saw, and she understood what was passing in his mind.\nYet she did not see and understand all by any means; and it is hard to\ntell what further show of fire there might have been, but that the Clerk\nof the Court was there, saying harshly under his breath, “The huzzy!\nThe crafty huzzy!”",
        "The Clerk of the Court was wrong.  Virginie was merely sentimental, not\nintriguing or deceitful; for Jean Jacques was not a widower–and she was\nan honest woman and genuinely tender-hearted.",
        "“I’m coming to the Manor Cartier to-morrow,” Virginie continued.  “I have\na rug of yours.  By mistake it was left at my house by M’sieu’ Dolores.”",
        "“You needn’t do that.  I will call at your place tomorrow for it,\"\nreplied Jean Jacques almost eagerly.  “I told M’sieu’ Dolores to-day\nnever to enter my house again.  I didn’t know it was your rug.  It was\ngiving away your property, not his own,” she hurriedly explained, and her\nface flushed.",
        "“That is the Spanish of it,” said Jean Jacques bitterly.  His eyes were\nbeing opened in many directions to-day.",
        "M. Fille was in distress.  Jean Jacques had had a warning about Sebastian\nDolores, but here was another pit into which he might fall, the pit\ndigged by a widow, who, no doubt, would not hesitate to marry a divorced\nCatholic philosopher, if he could get a divorce by hook or by crook.\nJean Jacques had said that he was going to Virginie Poucette’s place\nthe next day.  That was as bad as it could be; yet there was this to the\ngood, that it was to-morrow and not to-day; and who could tell what might\nhappen between to-day and to-morrow!",
        "A moment later the three were standing outside the office in the street.\nAs Jean Jacques climbed into his red wagon, Virginie Poucette’s eyes were\nattracted to the northern sky where a reddish glow appeared, and she gave\nan exclamation of surprise.",
        "“That must be a fire,” she said, pointing.",
        "“A bit of pine-land probably,” said M. Fille–with anxiety, however, for\nthe red glow lay in the direction of St. Saviour’s where were the Manor\nCartier and Jean Jacques’ mills.  Maitre Fille was possessed of a\nsuperstition that all the things which threaten a man’s life to wreck it,\noperate awhile in their many fields before they converge like an army in\none field to deliver the last attack on their victim.  It would not have\nseemed strange to him, if out of the night a voice of the unseen had said\nthat the glow in the sky came from the Manor Cartier.  This very day\nthree things had smitten Jean Jacques, and, if three, why not four or\nfive, or fifty!",
        "With a strange fascination Jean Jacques’ eyes were fastened on the glow.\nHe clucked to his horses, and they started jerkily away.  M. Fille and\nthe widow Poucette said good-bye to him, but he did not hear, or if he\nheard, he did not heed.  His look was set upon the red reflection which\nwidened in the sky and seemed to grow nearer and nearer.  The horses\nquickened their pace.  He touched them with the whip, and they went\nfaster.  The glow increased as he left Vilray behind.  He gave the horses\nthe whip again sharply, and they broke into a gallop.  Yet his eyes\nscarcely left the sky.  The crimson glow drew him, held him, till his\nbrain was afire also.  Jean Jacques had a premonition and a conviction\nwhich was even deeper than the imagination of M. Fille.",
        "In Vilray, behind him, the telegraph clerk was in the street shouting to\nsomeone to summon the local fire-brigade to go to St. Saviour’s.",
        "“What is it–what is it?” asked M. Fille of the telegraph clerk in\nmarked agitation.",
        "“It’s M’sieu’ Jean Jacques’ flour-mill,” was the reply.",
        "Wagons and buggies and carts began to take the road to the Manor Cartier;\nand Maitre Fille went also with the widow of Palass Poucette.",
        "Jean Jacques did not go to the house of the widow of Palass Poucette\n\"next day” as he had proposed: and she did not expect him.  She had seen\nhis flour-mill burned to the ground on the-evening when they met in the\noffice of the Clerk of the evening Court, when Jean Jacques had learned\nthat his Zoe had gone into farther and farther places away from him.\nPerhaps Virginie Poucette never had shed as many tears in any whole year\nof her life as she did that night, not excepting the year Palass Poucette\ndied, and left her his farm and seven horses, more or less sound, and a\nthreshing-machine in good condition.  The woman had a rare heart and\nthere was that about Jean Jacques which made her want to help him.  She\nhad no clear idea as to how that could be done, but she had held his hand\nat any rate, and he had seemed the better for it.  Virginie had only an\nobjective view of things; and if she was not material, still she could\nbest express herself through the medium of the senses.",
        "There were others besides her who shed tears also–those who saw Jean\nJacques’ chief asset suddenly disappear in flame and smoke and all his\nother assets become thereby liabilities of a kind; and there were many\nwho would be the poorer in the end because of it.  If Jean Jacques went\ndown, he probably would not go alone.  Jean Jacques had done a good fire-\ninsurance business over a course of years, but somehow he had not insured\nhimself as heavily as he ought to have done; and in any case the fire-\npolicy for the mill was not in his own hands.  It was in the safe-keeping\nof M. Mornay at Montreal, who had warned M. Fille of the crisis in the\nmoney-master’s affairs on the very day that the crisis came.",
        "No one ever knew how it was that the mill took fire, but there was one\nman who had more than a shrewd suspicion, though there was no occasion\nfor mentioning it.  This was Sebastian Dolores.  He had not set the mill\nafire.  That would have been profitable from no standpoint, and he had no\ngrudge against Jean Jacques.  Why should he have a grudge?  Jean Jacques’\ngood fortune, as things were, made his own good fortune; for he ate and\ndrank and slept and was clothed at his son-in-law’s expense.  But he\nguessed accurately who had set the mill on fire, and that it was done\naccidentally.  He remembered that a man who smoked bad tobacco which had\nto be lighted over and over again, threw a burning match down after\napplying it to his pipe.  He remembered that there was a heap of flour-\nbags near where the man stood when the match was thrown down; and that\nsome loose strings for tying were also in a pile beside the bags.  So it\nwas easy for the thing to have happened if the man did not turn round\nafter he threw the match down, but went swaying on out of the mill, and\nover to the Manor Cartier, and up staggering to bed; for he had been\ndrinking potato-brandy, and he had been brought up on the mild wines of\nSpain!  In other words, the man who threw down the lighted match which\ndid the mischief was Sebastian Dolores himself.",
        "He regretted it quite as much as he had ever regretted anything; and on\nthe night of the fire there were tears in his large brown eyes which\ndeceived the New Cure and others; though they did not deceive the widow\nof Palass Poucette, who had found him out, and who now had no pleasure at\nall in his aged gallantries.  But the regret Dolores experienced would\nnot prevent him from doing Jean Jacques still greater injury if, and\nwhen, the chance occurred, should it be to his own advantage.",
        "Jean Jacques shed no tears on the night that his beloved flour-mill\nbecame a blackened ruin, and his saw-mill had a narrow escape.  He was\nlike one in a dream, scarcely realizing that men were saying kind things\nto him; that the New Cure held his hand and spoke to him more like a\nbrother than one whose profession it was to be good to those who\nsuffered.  In his eyes was the same half-rapt, intense, distant look\nwhich came into them when, at Vilray, he saw that red reflection in the\nsky over against St. Saviour’s, and urged his horses onward.",
        "The world knew that the burning of the mill was a blow to Jean Jacques,\nbut it did not know how great and heavy the blow was.  First one and then\nanother of his friends said he was insured, and that in another six\nmonths the mill-wheel would be turning again.  They said so to Jean\nJacques when he stood with his eyes fixed on the burning fabric, which\nnothing could save; but he showed no desire to speak.  He only nodded and\nkept on staring at the fire with that curious underglow in his eyes.\nSome chemistry of the soul had taken place in him in the hour when he\ndrove to the Manor Cartier from Vilray, and it produced a strange fire,\nwhich merged into the reflection of the sky above the burning mill.\nLater, came things which were strange and eventful in his life, but that\nunder-glow was for ever afterwards in his eyes.  It was in singular\ncontrast to the snapping fire which had been theirs all the days of his\nlife till now–the snapping fire of action, will and design.  It still\nwas there when they said to him suddenly that the wind had changed, and\nthat the flame and sparks were now blowing toward the saw-mill.  Even\nwhen he gave orders, and set to work to defend the saw-mill, arranging a\nline of men with buckets on its roof, and so saving it, this look\nremained.  It was something spiritual and unmaterial, something, maybe,\nwhich had to do with the philosophy he had preached, thought and\npractised over long years.  It did not disappear when at last, after\nmidnight, everyone had gone, and the smouldering ruins of his greatest\nasset lay mournful in the wan light of the moon.",
        "Kind and good friends like the Clerk of the Court and the New Cure had\nseen him to his bedroom at midnight, leaving him there with a promise\nthat they would come on the morrow; and he had said goodnight evenly, and\nhad shut the door upon them with a sort of smile.  But long after they\nhad gone, when Sebastian Dolores and Seraphe Corniche were asleep, he had\ngot up again and left the house, to gaze at the spot where the big white\nmill with the red roof had been-the mill which had been there in the days\nof the Baron of Beaugard, and to which time had only added size and\nadornment.  The gold-cock weathervane of the mill, so long the admiration\nof people living and dead, and indeed the symbol of himself, as he had\nbeen told, being so full of life and pride, courage and vigour-it lay\namong the ruins, a blackened relic of the Barbilles.",
        "He had said in M. Fille’s office not many hours before, “I will fight it\nall out alone,” and here in the tragic quiet of the night he made his\nresolve a reality.  In appearance he was not now like the “Seigneur” who\nsang to the sailors on the Antoine when she was fighting for the shore of\nGaspe; nevertheless there was that in him which would keep him much the\nsame man to the end.",
        "Indeed, as he got into bed that fateful night he said aloud: “They shall\nsee that I am not beaten.  If they give me time up there in Montreal I’ll\nkeep the place till Zoe comes back–till Zoe comes home.”",
        "As he lay and tried to sleep, he kept saying over to himself, “Till Zoe\ncomes home.”",
        "He thought that if he could but have Zoe back, it all would not matter so\nmuch.  She would keep looking at him and saying, “There’s the man that\nnever flinched when things went wrong; there’s the man that was a friend\nto everyone.”",
        "At last a thought came to him–the key to the situation as it seemed, the\none thing necessary to meet the financial situation.  He would sell the\nbiggest farm he owned, which had been to him in its importance like the\nflour-mill itself.  He had had an offer for it that very day, and a\nbigger offer still a week before.  It was mortgaged to within eight\nthousand dollars of what it could be sold for but, if he could gain time,\nthat eight thousand dollars would build the mill again.  M. Mornay, the\nBig Financier, would certainly see that this was his due–to get his\nchance to pull things straight.  Yes, he would certainly sell the\nBarbille farm to-morrow.  With this thought in his mind he went to sleep\nat last, and he did not wake till the sun was high.",
        "It was a sun of the most wonderful brightness and warmth.  Yesterday it\nwould have made the Manor Cartier and all around it look like Arcady.\nBut as it shone upon the ruins of the mill, when Jean Jacques went out\ninto the working world again, it made so gaunt and hideous a picture\nthat, in spite of himself, a cry of misery came from his lips.",
        "Through all the misfortunes which had come to him the outward semblance\nof things had remained, and when he went in and out of the plantation of\nthe Manor Cartier, there was no physical change in the surroundings,\nwhich betrayed the troubles and disasters fallen upon its overlord.\nThere it all was just as it had ever been, and seeming to deny that\nanything had changed in the lives of those who made the place other than\na dead or deserted world.  When Carmen went, when Zoe fled, when his\ncousin Auguste Charron took his flight, when defeats at law abashed him,\nthe house and mills, and stores and offices, and goodly trees, and well-\nkept yards and barns and cattle-sheds all looked the same.  Thus it was\nthat he had been fortified.  In one sense his miseries had seemed unreal,\nbecause all was the same in the outward scene.  It was as though it all\nsaid to him: “It is a dream that those you love have vanished, that ill-\nfortune sits by your fireside.  One night you will go to bed thinking\nthat wife and child have gone, that your treasury is nearly empty; and in\nthe morning you will wake up and find your loved ones sitting in their\naccustomed places, and your treasury will be full to overflowing as of\nold.”",
        "So it was while the picture of his home scene remained unbroken and\nserene; but the hideous mass of last night’s holocaust was now before his\neyes, with little streams of smoke rising from the cindered pile, and\na hundred things with which his eyes had been familiar lay distorted,\nexcoriated and useless.  He realized with sudden completeness that a\nterrible change bad come in his life, that a cyclone had ruined the face\nof his created world.",
        "This picture did more to open up Jean Jacques’ eyes to his real position\nin life than anything he had experienced, than any sorrow he had\nsuffered.  He had been in torment in the past, but he had refused to see\nthat he was in Hades.  Now it was as though he had been led through the\nstreets of Hell by some dark spirit, while in vain he looked round for\nhis old friends Kant and Hegel, Voltaire and Rousseau and Rochefoucauld,\nPlato and Aristotle.",
        "While gazing at the dismal scene, however, and unheeding the idlers who\npoked about among the ruins, and watched him as one who was the centre of\na drama, he suddenly caught sight of the gold Cock of Beaugard, which had\nstood on the top of the mill, in the very centre of the ruins.",
        "Yes, there it was, the crested golden cock which had typified his own\nlife, as he went head high, body erect, spurs giving warning, and a\nclarion in his throat ready to blare forth at any moment.  There was the\ngolden Cock of Beaugard in the cinders, the ashes and the dust.  His chin\ndropped on his breast, and a cloud like a fog on the coast of Gaspe\nsettled round him.  Yet even as his head drooped, something else\nhappened–one of those trivial things which yet may be the pivot of great\nthings.  A cock crowed–almost in his very ear, it seemed.  He lifted his\nhead quickly, and a superstitious look flashed into his face.  His eyes\nfastened on the burnished head of the Cock among the ruins.  To his\nexcited imagination it was as though the ancient symbol of the Barbilles\nhad spoken to him in its own language of good cheer and defiance.  Yes,\nthere it was, half covered by the ruins, but its head was erect in the\nmidst of fire and disaster.  Brought low, it was still alert above the\nwreckage.  The child, the dreamer, the optimist, the egoist, and the man\nalive in Jean Jacques sprang into vigour again.  It was as though the\nCock of Beaugard had really summoned him to action, and the crowing had\nnot been that of a barnyard bantam not a hundred feet away from him.\nJean Jacques’ head went up too.",
        "“Me–I am what I always was, nothing can change me,” he exclaimed\ndefiantly.  “I will sell the Barbille farm and build the mill again.”",
        "So it was that by hook or by crook, and because the Big Financier had\nmore heart than he even acknowledged to his own wife, Jean Jacques did\nsell the Barbille farm, and got in cash–in good hard cash-eight thousand\ndollars after the mortgage was paid.  M. Mornay was even willing to take\nthe inadequate indemnity of the insurance policy on the mill, and lose\nthe rest, in order that Jean Jacques should have the eight thousand\ndollars to rebuild.  This he did because Jean Jacques showed such amazing\ncourage after the burning of the mill, and spread himself out in a\ngreater activity than his career had yet shown.  He shaved through this\nfinancial crisis, in spite of the blow he had received by the loss of his\nlawsuits, the flitting of his cousin, Auguste Charron, and the farm debts\nof this same cousin.  It all meant a series of manipulations made\npossible by the apparent confidence reposed in him by M. Mornay.",
        "On the day he sold his farm he was by no means out of danger of absolute\ninsolvency–he was in fact ruined; but he was not yet the victim of those\nprocesses which would make him legally insolvent.  The vultures were\nhovering, but they had not yet swooped, and there was the Manor saw-mill\ngoing night and day; for by the strangest good luck Jean Jacques received\nan order for M. Mornay’s new railway (Judge Carcasson was behind that)\nwhich would keep his saw-mill working twenty-four hours in the day for\nsix months.",
        "“I like his pluck, but still, ten to one, he loses,” remarked M. Mornay\nto Judge Carcasson.  “He is an unlucky man, and I agree with Napoleon\nthat you oughtn’t to be partner with an unlucky man.”",
        "“Yet you have had to do with Monsieur Jean Jacques,” responded the aged\nJudge.",
        "M. Mornay nodded indulgently.",
        "“Yes, without risk, up to the burning of the mill.  Now I take my\nchances, simply because I’m a fool too, in spite of all the wisdom I see\nin history and in life’s experiences.  I ought to have closed him up, but\nI’ve let him go on, you see.”",
        "“You will not regret it,” remarked the Judge.  “He really is worth it.”",
        "“But I think I will regret it financially.  I think that this is the last\nflare of the ambition and energy of your Jean Jacques.  That often\nhappens–a man summons up all his reserves for one last effort.  It’s\npartly pride, partly the undefeated thing in him, partly the gambling\nspirit which seizes men when nothing is left but one great spectacular\nsuccess or else be blotted out.  That’s the case with your philosopher;\nand I’m not sure that I won’t lose twenty thousand dollars by him yet.”",
        "“You’ve lost more with less justification,” retorted the Judge, who, in\nhis ninetieth year, was still as alive as his friend at sixty.",
        "M. Mornay waved a hand in acknowledgment, and rolled his cigar from\ncorner to corner of his mouth.  “Oh, I’ve lost a lot more in my time,\nJudge, but with a squint in my eye!  But I’m doing this with no\nastigmatism.  I’ve got the focus.”",
        "The aged Judge gave a conciliatory murmur-he had a fine persuasive voice.\n\"You would never be sorry for what you have done if you had known his\ndaughter–his Zoe.  It’s the thought of her that keeps him going.  He\nwants the place to be just as she left it when she comes back.”",
        "“Well, well, let’s hope it will.  I’m giving him a chance,” replied M.\nMornay with his wineglass raised.  “He’s got eight thousand dollars in\ncash to build his mill again; and I hope he’ll keep a tight hand on it\ntill the mill is up.”",
        "Keep a tight hand on it?",
        "That is what Jean Jacques meant to do; but if a man wants to keep a tight\nhand on money he should not carry it about in his pocket in cold, hard\ncash.  It was a foolish whim of Jean Jacques that he must have the eight\nthousand dollars in cash–in hundred-dollar bills–and not in the form of\na cheque; but there was something childlike in him.  When, as he thought,\nhe had saved himself from complete ruin, he wanted to keep and gloat over\nthe trophy of victory, and his trophy was the eight thousand dollars got\nfrom the Barbille farm.  He would have to pay out two thousand dollars in\ncash to the contractors for the rebuilding of the mill at once,–they\nwere more than usually cautious–but he would have six thousand left,\nwhich he would put in the bank after he had let people see that he was\nwell fortified with cash.",
        "The child in him liked the idea of pulling out of his pocket a few\nthousand dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  He had always carried a good\ndeal of money loose in his pocket, and now that his resources were so\nlimited he would still make a gallant show.  After a week or two he would\ndeposit six thousand dollars in the bank; but he was so eager to begin\nbuilding the mill, that he paid over the stipulated two thousand dollars\nto the contractors on the very day he received the eight thousand.  A few\ndays later the remaining six thousand were housed in a cupboard with an\niron door in the wall of his office at the Manor Cartier.",
        "“There, that will keep me in heart and promise,” said Jean Jacques as he\nturned the key in the lock.",
        "The day after Jean Jacques had got a new lease of life and become his own\nbanker, he treated himself to one of those interludes of pleasure from\nwhich he had emerged in the past like a hermit from his cave.  He sat on\nthe hill above his lime-kilns, reading the little hand-book of philosophy\nwhich had played so big a part in his life.  Whatever else had disturbed\nhis mind and diverted him from his course, nothing had weaned him from\nthis obsession.  He still interlarded all his conversation with\nquotations from brilliant poseurs like Chateaubriand and Rochefoucauld,\nand from missionaries of thought like Hume and Hegel.",
        "His real joy, however, was in withdrawing for what might be called a\nseance of meditation from the world’s business.  Some men make\ncelebration in wine, sport and adventure; but Jean Jacques made it in\nflooding his mind with streams of human thought which often tried to run\nuphill, which were frequently choked with weeds, but still were like the\npool of Siloam to his vain mind.  They bathed that vain mind in the\nillusion that it could see into the secret springs of experience.",
        "So, on as bright a day as ever the New World offered, Jean Jacques sat\nreciting to himself a spectacular bit of logic from one of his idols,\nwedged between a piece of Aristotle quartz and Plato marble.  The sound\nof it was good in his ears.  He mouthed it as greedily and happily as\nthough he was not sitting on the edge of a volcano instead of the moss-\ngrown limestone on a hill above his own manor.",
        "“The course of events in the life of a man, whatever their gravity or\nlevity, are only to be valued and measured by the value and measure of\nhis own soul.  Thus, what in its own intrinsic origin and material should\nin all outer reason be a tragedy, does not of itself shake the\nfoundations or make a fissure in the superstructure.  Again–”",
        "Thus his oracle, but Jean Jacques’ voice suddenly died down, for, as he\nsat there, the face of a woman made a vivid call of recognition.  He\nslowly awakened from his self-hypnotism, to hear a woman speaking to him;\nto see two dark eyes looking at him from under heavy black brows with\nbright, intent friendliness.",
        "“They said at the Manor you had come this way, so I thought I’d not have\nmy drive for nothing, and here I am.  I wanted to say something to you,\nM’sieu’ Jean Jacques.”",
        "It was the widow of Palass Poucette.  She looked very fresh and friendly\nindeed, and she was the very acme of neatness.  If she was not handsome,\nshe certainly had a true and sweet comeliness of her own, due to the deep\nrose-colour of her cheeks, the ivory whiteness round the lustrous brown\neyes, the regular shining teeth which showed so much when she smiled, and\nthe look half laughing, half sentimental which dominated all.",
        "Before she had finished speaking Jean Jacques was on his feet with his\nhat off.  Somehow she seemed to be a part of that abstraction, that\nintoxication, in which he had just been drowning his accumulated\nanxieties.  Not that Virginie Poucette was logical or philosophical, or\na child of thought, for she was wholly the opposite-practical, sensuous,\nemotional, a child of nature and of Eve.  But neither was Jean Jacques a\nreal child of thought, though he made unconscious pretence of it.  He\nalso was a child of nature–and Adam.  He thought he had the courage of\nhis convictions, but it was only the courage of his emotions.  His\nphilosophy was but the bent or inclination of a mind with a capacity\nto feel things rather than to think them.  He had feeling, the first\nessential of the philosopher, but there he stayed, an undeveloped\nchrysalis.",
        "His look was abstracted still as he took the hand of the widow of Palass\nPoucette; but he spoke cheerfully.  “It is a pleasure, madame, to welcome\nyou among my friends,” he said.",
        "He made a little flourish with the book which had so long been his bosom\nfriend, and added: “But I hope you are in no trouble that you come to me\n–so many come to me in their troubles,” he continued with an air of\nsatisfaction.",
        "“Come to you–why, you have enough troubles of your own!” she made\nanswer.  “It’s because you have your own troubles that I’m here.”",
        "“Why you are here,” he remarked vaguely.",
        "There was something very direct and childlike in Virginie Poucette.  She\ncould not pretend; she wore her heart on her sleeve.  She travelled a\nlong distance in a little while.",
        "“I’ve got no trouble myself,” she responded.  “But, yes, I have,” she\nadded.  “I’ve got one trouble–it’s yours.  It’s that you’ve been having\nhard times–the flour-mill, your cousin Auguste Charron, the lawsuits,\nand all the rest.  They say at Vilray that you have all you can do to\nkeep out of the Bankruptcy Court, and that–”",
        "Jean Jacques started, flushed, and seemed about to get angry; but she put\nthings right at once.",
        "“People talk more than they know, but there’s always some fire where\nthere’s smoke,” she hastened to explain.  “Besides, your father-in-law\nbabbles more than is good for him or for you.  I thought at first that\nM. Dolores was a first-class kind of man, that he had had hard times too,\nand I let him come and see me; but I found him out, and that was the end\nof it, you may be sure.  If you like him, I don’t want to say anything\nmore, but I’m sure that he’s no real friend to you-or to anybody.  If\nthat man went to confession–but there, that’s not what I’ve come for.\nI’ve come to say to you that I never felt so sorry for anyone in my life\nas I do for you.  I cried all night after your beautiful mill was burned\ndown.  You were coming to see me next day–you remember what you said in\nM. Fille’s office–but of course you couldn’t.  Of course, there was no\nreason why you should come to see me really–I’ve ’only got two hundred\nacres and the house.  It’s a good house, though–Palass saw to that–and\nit’s insured; but still I know you’d have come just the same if I’d had\nonly two acres.  I know.  There’s hosts of people you’ve been good to\nhere, and they’re sorry for you; and I’m sorrier than any, for I’m alone,\nand you’re alone, too, except for the old Dolores, and he’s no good to\neither of us–mark my words, no good to you!  I’m sorry for you, M’sieu’\nJean Jacques, and I’ve come to say that I’m ready to lend you two\nthousand dollars, if that’s any help.  I could make it more if I had\ntime; but sometimes money on the spot is worth a lot more than what’s\njust crawling to you–snailing along while you eat your heart out.  Two\nthousand dollars is two thousand dollars–I know what it’s worth to me,\nthough it mayn’t be much to you; but I didn’t earn it.  It belonged to\na first-class man, and he worked for it, and he died and left it to me.\nIt’s not come easy, go easy with me.  I like to feel I’ve got two\nthousand cash without having to mortgage for it.  But it belonged to\na number-one man, a man of brains–I’ve got no brains, only some sense\n–and I want another good man to use it and make the world easier for\nhimself.”",
        "It was a long speech, and she delivered it in little gasps of oratory\nwhich were brightened by her wonderfully kind smile and the heart–not to\nsay sentiment–which showed in her face.  The sentiment, however, did not\nprejudice Jean Jacques against her, for he was a sentimentalist himself.\nHis feelings were very quick, and before she had spoken fifty words the\nunderglow of his eyes was flooded by something which might have been\nmistaken for tears.  It was, however, only the moisture of gratitude and\nthe soul’s good feeling.",
        "“Well there, well there,” he said when she had finished, “I’ve never had\nanything like this in my life before.  It’s the biggest thing in the art\nof being a neighbour I’ve ever seen.  You’ve only been in the parish\nthree years, and yet you’ve shown me a confidence immense, inspiring!\nIt is as the Greek philosopher said, ’To conceive the human mind aright\nis the greatest gift from the gods.’  And to you, who never read a line\nof philosophy, without doubt, you have done the thing that is greatest.\nIt says, ’I teach neighbourliness and life’s exchange.’  Madame, your\nhouse ought to be called Neighbourhood House.  It is the epitome of the\nspirit, it is the shrine of–”",
        "He was working himself up to a point where he could forget all the things\nthat trouble humanity, in the inebriation of an idealistic soul which had\na casing of passion, but the passion of the mind and not of the body; for\nJean Jacques had not a sensual drift in his organism.  If there had been\na sensual drift, probably Carmen would still have been the lady of his\nmanor, and he would still have been a magnate and not a potential\nbankrupt; for in her way Carmen had been a kind of balance to his\njudgment in the business of life, in spite of her own material and\n(at the very last) sensual strain.  It was a godsend to Jean Jacques to\nhave such an inspiration as Virginie Poucette had given him.  He could\nnot in these days, somehow, get the fires of his soul lighted, as he was\nwont to do in the old times, and he loved talking–how he loved talking\nof great things!  He was really going hard, galloping strong, when\nVirginie interrupted him, first by an exclamation, then, as insistently\nhe repeated the words, “It is the epitome of the spirit, the shrine of–”",
        "She put out a hand, interrupting him, and said: “Yes, yes, M’sieu’\nJean Jacques, that’s as good as Moliere, I s’pose, or the Archbishop at\nQuebec, but are you going to take it, the two thousand dollars?  I made a\nlong speech, I know, but that was to tell you why I come with the money\"\n–she drew out a pocketbook–\"with the order on my lawyer to hand the\ncash over to you.  As a woman I had to explain to you, there being lots\nof ideas about what a woman should do and what she shouldn’t do; but\nthere’s nothing at all for you to explain, and Mere Langlois and a lot of\nothers would think I’m vain enough now without your compliments.  I’m a\nneighbour if you like, and I offer you a loan.  Will you take it–that’s\nall?”",
        "He held out his hand in silence and took the paper from her.  Putting his\nhead a little on one side, he read it.  At first he seemed hardly to get\nthe formal language clear in his mind; however, or maybe his mind was\nstill away in that abstraction into which he had whisked it when he began\nhis reply to her fine offer; but he read it out aloud, first quickly,\nthen very slowly, and he looked at the signature with a deeply meditative\nair.",
        "“Virginie Poucette–that’s a good name,” he remarked; “and also good for\ntwo thousand dollars!”  He paused to smile contentedly over his own joke.\n\"And good for a great deal more than that too,” he added with a nod.",
        "“Yes, ten times as much as that,” she responded quickly, her eyes fixed\non his face.  She scarcely knew herself what she was thinking when she\nsaid it; but most people who read this history will think she was hinting\nthat her assets might be united with his, and so enable him to wipe out\nhis liabilities and do a good deal more besides.  Yet, how could that be,\nsince Carmen Dolores was still his wife if she was alive; and also they\nboth were Catholics, and Catholics did not recognize divorce!",
        "Truth is, Virginie Poucette’s mind did not define her feelings at all\nclearly, or express exactly what she wanted.  Her actions said one thing\ncertainly; but if the question had been put to her, whether she was doing\nthis thing because of a wish to take the place of Carmen Dolores in Jean\nJacques’ life she would have said no at once.  She had not come to that\n–yet.  She was simply moved by a sentiment of pity for Jean Jacques, and\nas she had no child, or husband, or sister, or brother, or father, or\nmother, but only relatives who tried to impose upon her, she needed an\nobjective for the emotions of her nature, for the overflow of her unused\naffection and her unsatisfied maternal spirit.  Here, then, was the most\nobvious opportunity–a man in trouble who had not deserved the bitter bad\nluck which had come to him.  Even old Mere Langlois in the market-place\nat Vilray had admitted that, and had said the same later on in Virginie’s\nhome.",
        "For an instant Jean Jacques was fascinated by the sudden prospect which\nopened out before him.  If he asked her, this woman would probably loan\nhim five thousand dollars–and she had mentioned nothing about security!",
        "“What security do you want?” he asked in a husky voice.",
        "“Security?  I don’t understand about that,” she replied.  “I’d not offer\nyou the money if I didn’t think you were an honest man, and an honest man\nwould pay me back.  A dishonest man wouldn’t pay me back, security or no\nsecurity.”",
        "“He’d have to pay you back if the security was right to start with,” Jean\nJacques insisted.  “But you don’t want security, because you think I’m an\nhonest man!  Well, for sure you’re right.  I am honest.  I never took a\ncent that wasn’t mine; but that’s not everything.  If you lend you ought\nto have security.  I’ve lost a good deal from not having enough security\nat the start.  You are willing to lend me money without security–that’s\nenough to make me feel thirty again, and I’m fifty–I’m fifty,” he added,\nas though with an attempt to show her that she could not think of him in\nany emotional way; though the day when his flour-mill was burned he had\nfelt the touch of her fingers comforting and thrilling.",
        "“You think Jean Jacques Barbille’s word as good as his bond?” he\ncontinued.  “So it is; but I’m going to pull this thing through alone.\nThat’s what I said to you and Maitre Fille at his office.  I meant it too\n–help of God, it is the truth!”",
        "He had forgotten that if M. Mornay had not made it easy for him, and had\nnot refrained from insisting on his pound of flesh, he would now be\ninsolvent and with no roof over him.  Like many another man Jean Jacques\nwas the occasional slave of formula, and also the victim of phases of his\nown temperament.  In truth he had not realized how big a thing M. Mornay\nhad done for him.  He had accepted the chance given him as the tribute to\nhis own courage and enterprise and integrity, and as though it was to the\nadvantage of his greatest creditor to give him another start; though in\nreality it had made no difference to the Big Financier, who knew his man\nand, with wide-open eyes, did what he had done.",
        "Virginie was not subtle.  She did not understand, was never satisfied\nwith allusions, and she had no gift for catching the drift of things.\nShe could endure no peradventure in her conversation.  She wanted plain\nspeaking and to be literally sure.",
        "“Are you going to take it?” she asked abruptly.",
        "He could not bear to be checked in his course.  He waved a hand and\nsmiled at her.  Then his eyes seemed to travel away into the distance,\nthe look of the dreamer in them; but behind all was that strange, ruddy\nunderglow of revelation which kept emerging from shadows, retreating and\nemerging, yet always there now, in much or in little, since the burning\nof the mill.",
        "“I’ve lent a good deal of money without security in my time,” he\nreflected, “but the only people who ever paid me back were a deaf and\ndumb man and a flyaway–a woman that was tired of selling herself, and\nstarted straight and right with the money I lent her.  She had been the\nwife of a man who studied with me at Laval.  She paid me back every\npenny, too, year by year for five years.  The rest I lent money to never\npaid; but they paid, the dummy and the harlot that was, they paid!  But\nthey paid for the rest also!  If I had refused these two because of the\nothers, I’d not be fit to visit at Neighbourhood House where Virginie\nPoucette lives.”",
        "He looked closely at the order she had given him again, as though to let\nit sink in his mind and be registered for ever.  “I’m going to do without\nany further use of your two thousand dollars,” he continued cheer fully.\n\"It has done its work.  You’ve lent it to me, I’ve used it\"–he put the\nhand holding it on his breast–\"and I’m paying it back to you, but\nwithout interest.”  He gave the order to her.",
        "“I don’t see what you mean,” she said helplessly, and she looked at the\npaper, as though it had undergone some change while it was in his hand.",
        "“That you would lend it me is worth ten times two thousand to me,\nVirginie Poucette,” he explained.  “It gives me, not a kick from behind\n–I’ve not had much else lately–but it holds a light in front of me.\nIt calls me.  It says, ’March on, Jean Jacques–climb the mountain.’\nIt summons me to dispose my forces for the campaign which will restore\nthe Manor Cartier to what it has ever been since the days of the Baron\nof Beaugard.  It quickens the blood at my heart.  It restores–”",
        "Virginie would not allow him to go on.  “You won’t let me help you?\nSuppose I do lose the money–I didn’t earn it; it was earned by Palass\nPoucette, and he’d understand, if he knew.  I can live without the money,\nif I have to, but you would pay it back, I know.  You oughtn’t to take\nany extra risks.  If your daughter should come back and not find you\nhere, if she returned to the Manor Cartier, and–”",
        "He made an insistent gesture.  “Hush!  Be still, my friend–as good a\nfriend as a man could have.  If my Zoe came back I’d like to feel–I’d\nlike to feel that I had saved things alone; that no woman’s money made\nme safe.  If Zoe or if–”",
        "He was going to say, “If Carmen came back,” for his mind was moving in\npast scenes; but he stopped short and looked around helplessly.  Then\npresently, as though by an effort, he added with a bravura note in his\nvoice:",
        "“The world has been full of trouble for a long time, but there have\nalways been men to say to trouble, ’I am master, I have the mind to get\nabove it all.’  Well, I am one of them.”",
        "There was no note of vanity or bombast in his voice as he said this,\nand in his eyes that new underglow deepened and shone.  Perhaps in this\ninstant he saw more of his future than he would speak of to anyone on\nearth.  Perhaps prevision was given him, and it was as the Big Financier\nhad said to Maitre Fille, that his philosophy was now, at the last, to be\nof use to him.  When his wife had betrayed him, and his wife and child\nhad left him, he had said, “Moi je suis philosophe!” but he was a man of\nwealth in those days, and money soothes hurts of that kind in rare\ndegree.  Would he still say, whatever was yet to come, that he was a\nphilosopher?",
        "“Well, I’ve done what I thought would help you, and I can’t say more than\nthat,” Virginie remarked with a sigh, and there was despondency in her\neyes.  Her face became flushed, her bosom showed agitation; she looked at\nhim as she had done in Maitre Fille’s office, and a wave of feeling\npassed over him now, as it did then, and he remembered, in response to\nher look, the thrill of his fingers in her palm.  His face now flushed\nalso, and he had an impulse to ask her to sit down beside him.  He put it\naway from him, however, for the present, at any rate-who could tell what\nto-morrow might bring forth!–and then he held out his hand to her.  His\nvoice shook a little when he spoke; but it cleared, and began to ring,\nbefore he had said a dozen words.",
        "“I’ll never forget what you’ve said and done this morning, Virginie\nPoucette,” he declared; “and if I break the back of the trouble that’s in\nmy way, and come out cock o’ the walk again\"–the gold Cock of Beaugard\nin the ruins near and the clarion of the bantam of his barnyard were in\nhis mind and ears–\"it’ll be partly because of you.  I hug that thought\nto me.”",
        "“I could do a good deal more than that,” she ventured, with a tremulous\nvoice, and then she took her warm hand from his nervous grasp, and turned\nsharply into the path which led back towards the Manor.  She did not turn\naround, and she walked quickly away.",
        "There was confusion in her eyes and in her mind.  It would take some time\nto make the confusion into order, and she was now hot, now cold, in all\nher frame, when at last she climbed into her wagon.",
        "This physical unrest imparted itself to all she did that day.  First her\nhorses were driven almost at a gallop; then they were held down to a slow\nwalk; then they were stopped altogether, and she sat in the shade of the\ntrees on the road to her home, pondering–whispering to herself and\npondering.",
        "As her horses were at a standstill she saw a wagon approaching.\nInstantly she touched her pair with the whip, and moved on.  Before the\napproaching wagon came alongside, she knew from the grey and the\ndarkbrown horses who was driving them, and she made a strong effort for\ncomposure.  She succeeded indifferently, but her friend, Mere Langlois,\ndid not notice this fact as her wagon drew near.  There was excitement in\nMere Langlois’ face.",
        "“There’s been a shindy at the ’Red Eagle’ tavern,” she said.  “That\nfather-in-law of M’sieu’ Jean Jacques and Rocque Valescure, the landlord,\nthey got at each other’s throats.  Dolores hit Valescure on the head with\na bottle.”",
        "“He didn’t kill Valescure, did he?”",
        "“Not that–no.  But Valescure is hurt bad–as bad.  It was six to one and\nhalf a dozen to the other–both no good at all.  But of course they’ll\narrest the old man–your great friend!  He’ll not give you any more fur-\nrobes, that’s sure.  He got away from the tavern, though, and he’s hiding\nsomewhere.  M’sieu’ Jean Jacques can’t protect him now; he isn’t what he\nonce was in the parish.  He’s done for, and old Dolores will have to go\nto trial.  They’ll make it hot for him when they catch him.  No more fur-\nrobes from your Spanish friend, Virginie !  You’ll have to look somewhere\nelse for your beaux, though to be sure there are enough that’d be glad to\nget you with that farm of yours, and your thrifty ways, if you keep your\ncharacter.”",
        "Virginie was quite quiet now.  The asperity and suggestiveness of the\nother’s speech produced a cooling effect upon her.",
        "“Better hurry, Mere Langlois, or everybody won’t hear your story before\nsundown.  If your throat gets tired, there’s Brown’s Bronchial Troches–\"\nShe pointed to an advertisement on the fence near by.  “M. Fille’s cook\nsays they cure a rasping throat.”",
        "With that shot, Virginie Poucette whipped up her horses and drove on.\nShe did not hear what Mere Langlois called after her, for Mere Langlois\nhad been slow to recover from the unexpected violence dealt by one whom\nshe had always bullied.",
        "“Poor Jean Jacques!” said Virginie Poucette to herself as her horses ate\nup the ground.  “That’s another bit of bad luck.  He’ll not sleep to-\nnight.  Ah, the poor Jean Jacques–and all alone–not a hand to hold; no\none to rumple that shaggy head of his or pat him on the back!  His wife\nand Ma’m’selle Zoe, they didn’t know a good thing when they had it.  No,\nhe’ll not sleep to-night-ah, my dear Jean Jacques!”",
        "But Jean Jacques did sleep well that night; though it would have been\nbetter for him if he had not done so.  The contractor’s workmen had\narrived in the early afternoon, he had seen the first ton of debris\nremoved from the ruins of the historic mill, and it was crowned by the\ngold Cock of Beaugard, all grimy with the fire, but jaunty as of yore.\nThe cheerfulness of the workmen, who sang gaily an old chanson of mill-\nlife as they tugged at the timbers and stones, gave a fillip to the\nspirits of Jean Jacques, to whom had come a red-letter day.",
        "Like Mirza on the high hill of Bagdad he had had his philosophic\nmeditations; his good talk with Virginie Poucette had followed; and the\nwoman of her lingered in the feeling of his hand all day, as something\nkind and homelike and true.  Also in the evening had come M. Fille, who\nbrought him a message from Judge Carcasson, that he must make the world\nsing for himself again.",
        "Contrary to what Mere Langlois had thought, he had not been perturbed by\nthe parish noise about the savage incident at “The Red Eagle,” and the\ndesperate affair which would cause the arrest of his father-in-law.  He\nwas at last well inclined to be rid of Sebastian Dolores, who had ceased\nto be a comfort to him, and who brought him hateful and not kindly\nmemories of his lost women, and the happy hours of the past they\nrepresented.",
        "M. Fille had come to the Manor in much alarm, lest the news of the\nmiserable episode at “The Red Eagle” should bring Jean Jacques down again\nto the depths.  He was infinitely relieved, however, to find that the\nlord of the Manor Cartier seemed only to be grateful that Sebastian\nDolores did not return, and nodded emphatically when M. Fille remarked\nthat perhaps it would be just as well if he never did return.",
        "As M. Fille sat with his host at the table in the sunset light, Jean\nJacques seemed quieter and steadier of body and mind than he had been for\na long, long time.  He even drank three glasses of the cordial which Mere\nLanglois had left for him, with the idea that it might comfort him when\nhe got the bad news about Sebastian Dolores; and parting with M. Fille at\nthe door, he waved a hand and said: “Well, good-night, master of the\nlaws.  Safe journey!  I’m off to bed, and I’ll sleep without rocking,\nthat’s very sure and sweet.”",
        "He stood and waved his hand several times to M. Fille–till he was\nout of sight indeed; and the Clerk of the Court smiled to himself long\nafterwards, recalling Jean Jacques’ cheerful face as he had seen it at\ntheir parting in the gathering dusk.  As for Jean Jacques, when he locked\nup the house at ten o’clock, with Dolores still absent, he had the air of\na man from whose shoulders great weights had fallen.",
        "“Now I’ve shut the door on him, it’ll stay shut,” he said firmly.  “Let\nhim go back to work.  He’s no good here to me, to himself, or to anyone.\nAnd that business of the fur-robe and Virginie Poucette–ah, that!”",
        "He shook his head angrily, then seeing the bottle of cordial still\nuncorked on the sideboard, he poured some out and drank it very slowly,\ntill his eyes were on the ceiling above him and every drop had gone home.\nPresently, with the bedroom lamp in his hand, he went upstairs, humming\nto himself the chanson the workmen had sung that afternoon as they raised\nagain the walls of the mill:",
        "                   “Distaff of flax flowing behind her\n                    Margatton goes to the mill\n                    On the old grey ass she goes,\n                    The flour of love it will blind her\n                    Ah, the grist the devil will grind her,\n                    When Margatton goes to the mill!\n                    On the old grey ass she goes,\n                    And the old grey ass, he knows!”",
        "He liked the sound of his own voice this night of his Reconstruction\nPeriod–or such it seemed to him; and he thought that no one heard his\nsinging save himself.  There, however, he was mistaken.  Someone was\nhidden in the house–in the big kitchen-bunk which served as a bed or a\nseat, as needed.  This someone had stolen in while Jean Jacques and M.\nFille were at supper.  His name was Dolores, and he had a horse just over\nthe hill near by, to serve him when his work was done, and he could get\naway.",
        "The constables of Vilray had twice visited the Manor to arrest him that\nday, but they had been led in another direction by a clue which he had\nprovided; and afterwards in the dusk he had doubled back and hid himself\nunder Jean Jacques’ roof.  He had very important business at the Manor\nCartier.",
        "Jean Jacques’ voice ceased one song, and then, after a silence, it took\nup another, not so melodious.  Sebastian Dolores had impatiently waited\nfor this later “musicale” to begin–he had heard it often before; and\nwhen it was at last a regular succession of nasal explosions, he crawled\nout and began to do the business which had brought him to the Manor\nCartier.",
        "He did it all alone and with much skill; for when he was an anarchist in\nSpain, those long years ago, he had learned how to use tools with expert\nunderstanding.  Of late, Spain had been much in his mind.  He wanted to\ngo back there.  Nostalgia had possessed him ever since he had come again\nto the Manor Cartier after Zoe had left.  He thought much of Spain, and\nbut little of his daughter.  Memory of her was only poignant, in so far\nas it was associated with the days preceding the wreck of the Antoine.\nHe had had far more than enough of the respectable working life of the\nNew World; but there never was sufficient money to take him back to\nEurope, even were it safe to go.  Of late, however, he felt sure that he\nmight venture, if he could only get cash for the journey.  He wanted to\ndrift back to the idleness and adventure and the “easy money” of the old\nanarchist days in Cadiz and Madrid.  He was sick for the patio and the\nplaza, for the bull-fight, for the siesta in the sun, for the lazy\nglamour of the gardens and the red wine of Valladolid, for the redolent\ncigarette of the roadside tavern.  This cold iron land had spoiled him,\nand he would strive to get himself home again before it was too late.  In\nSpain there would always be some woman whom he could cajole; some comrade\nwhom he could betray; some priest whom he could deceive, whose pocket he\ncould empty by the recital of his troubles.  But if, peradventure, he\nreturned to Spain with money to spare in his pocket, how easy indeed it\nwould all be, and how happy he would find himself amid old surroundings\nand old friends!",
        "The way had suddenly opened up to him when Jean Jacques had brought\nhome in hard cash, and had locked away in the iron-doored cupboard in\nthe officewall, his last, his cherished, eight thousand dollars.  Six\nthousand of that eight were still left, and it was concern for this six\nthousand which had brought Dolores to the Manor this night when Jean\nJacques snored so loudly.  The events of the day at “The Red Eagle” had\nbrought things to a crisis in the affairs of Carmen’s father.  It was a\nfoolish business that at the tavern–so, at any rate, he thought, when\nit was all over, and he was awake to the fact that he must fly or go to\njail.  From the time he had, with a bottle of gin, laid Valescure low,\nSpain was the word which went ringing through his head, and the way to\nSpain was by the Six Thousand Dollar Route, the New World terminal of\nwhich was the cupboard in the wall at the Manor Cartier.",
        "Little cared Sebastian Dolores that the theft of the money would mean\nthe end of all things for Jean Jacques Barbille-for his own daughter’s\nhusband.  He was thinking of himself, as he had always done.",
        "He worked for two whole hours before he succeeded in quietly forcing open\nthe iron door in the wall; but it was done at last.  Curiously enough,\nJean Jacques’ snoring stopped on the instant that Sebastian Dolores’\nfingers clutched the money; but it began cheerfully again when the door\nin the wall closed once more.",
        "Five minutes after Dolores had thrust the six thousand dollars into his\npocket, his horse was galloping away over the hills towards the River St.\nLawrence.  If he had luck, he would reach it by the morning.  As it\nhappened, he had the luck.  Behind him, in the Manor Cartier, the man\nwho had had no luck and much philosophy, snored on till morning in\nunconscious content.",
        "It was a whole day before Jean Jacques discovered his loss.  When he had\nfinished his lonely supper the next evening, he went to the cupboard in\nhis office to cheer himself with the sight of the six thousand dollars.\nHe felt that he must revive his spirits.  They had been drooping all day,\nhe knew not why.",
        "When he saw the empty pigeon-hole in the cupboard, his sight swam.  It\nwas some time before it cleared, but, when it did, and he knew beyond\nperadventure the crushing, everlasting truth, not a sound escaped him.\nHis heart stood still.  His face filled with a panic confusion.  He\nseemed like one bereft of understanding.",
        "It is seldom that Justice travels as swiftly as Crime, and it is also\nseldom that the luck is more with the law than with the criminal.  It\ntook the parish of St. Saviour’s so long to make up its mind who stole\nJean Jacques’ six thousand dollars, that when the hounds got the scent at\nlast the quarry had reached the water–in other words, Sebastian Dolores\nhad achieved the St. Lawrence.  The criminal had had near a day’s start\nbefore a telegram was sent to the police at Montreal, Quebec, and other\nplaces to look out for the picaroon who had left his mark on the parish\nof St. Saviour’s.  The telegram would not even then have been sent had it\nnot been for M. Fille, who, suspecting Sebastian Dolores, still refrained\nfrom instant action.  This he did because he thought Jean Jacques would\nnot wish his beloved Zoe’s grandfather sent to prison.  But when other\npeople at last declared that it must have been Dolores, M. Fille insisted\non telegrams being sent by the magistrate at Vilray without Jean Jacques’\nconsent.  He had even urged the magistrate to “rush” the wire, because it\ncame home to him with stunning force that, if the money was not\nrecovered, Jean Jacques would be a beggar.  It was better to jail the\nfather-in-law, than for the little money-master to take to the road a\npauper, or stay on at St. Saviour’s as an underling where he had been\noverlord.",
        "As for Jean Jacques, in his heart of hearts he knew who had robbed him.\nHe realized that it was one of the radii of the comedy-tragedy which\nbegan on the Antoine, so many years before; and it had settled in his\nmind at last that Sebastian Dolores was but part of the dark machinery\nof fate, and that what was now had to be.",
        "For one whole day after the robbery he was like a man paralysed–\ndispossessed of active being; but when his creditors began to swarm, when\nM. Mornay sent his man of business down to foreclose his mortgages before\nothers could take action, Jean Jacques waked from his apathy.  He began\nan imitation of his old restlessness, and made essay again to pull the\nstrings of his affairs.  They were, however, so confused that a pull at\none string tangled them all.",
        "When the constables and others came to him, and said that they were on\nthe trail of the robber, and that the rogue would be caught, he nodded\nhis head encouragingly; but he was sure in his own mind that the flight\nof Dolores would be as successful as that of Carmen and Zoe.",
        "This is the way he put it: “That man–we will just miss finding him,\nas I missed Zoe at the railroad junction when she went away, as I missed\ncatching Carmen at St. Chrisanthine.  When you are at the shore, he will\nbe on the river; when you are getting into the train, he will be getting\nout.  It is the custom of the family.  At Bordeaux, the Spanish\ndetectives were on the shore gnashing their teeth, when he was a hundred\nyards away at sea on the Antoine.  They missed him like that; and we’ll\nmiss him too.  What is the good!  It was not his fault–that was the way\nof his bringing up beyond there at Cadiz, where they think more of a\ntoreador than of John the Baptist.  It was my fault.  I ought to have\nbanked the money.  I ought not to have kept it to look at like a gamin\nwith his marbles.  There it was in the wall; and there was Dolores a long\nway from home and wanting to get back.  He found the way by a gift of the\ntools; and I wish I had the same gift now; for I’ve got no other gift\nthat’ll earn anything for me.”",
        "These were the last dark or pessimistic words spoken at St. Saviour’s by\nJean Jacques; and they were said to the Clerk of the Court, who could not\ndeny the truth of them; but he wrung the hand of Jean Jacques\nnevertheless, and would not leave him night or day.  M. Fille was like a\nlittle cruiser protecting a fort when gunboats swarm near, not daring to\nattack till their battleship heaves in sight.  The battleship was the\nBig Financier, who saw that a wreck was now inevitable, and was only\nconcerned that there should be a fair distribution of the assets.  That\nmeant, of course, that he should be served first, and then that those\nbelow the salt should get a share.",
        "Revelation after revelation had been Jean Jacques’ lot of late years,\nbut the final revelation of his own impotence was overwhelming.  When\nhe began to stir about among his affairs, he was faced by the fact that\nthe law stood in his way.  He realized with inward horror his shattered\negotism and natural vanity; he saw that he might just as well be in jail;\nthat he had no freedom; that he could do nothing at all in regard to\nanything he owned; that he was, in effect, a prisoner of war where\nhe had been the general commanding an army.",
        "Yet the old pride intervened, and it was associated with some innate\nnobility; for from the hour in which it was known that Sebastian Dolores\nhad escaped in a steamer bound for France, and could not be overhauled,\nand the chances were that he would never have to yield up the six\nthousand dollars, Jean Jacques bustled about cheerfully, and as though\nhe had still great affairs of business to order and regulate.  It was a\nmake-believe which few treated with scorn.  Even the workmen at the mill\nhumoured him, as he came several times every day to inspect the work of\nrebuilding; and they took his orders, though they did not carry them out.\nNo one really carried out any of his orders except Seraphe Corniche, who,\nweeping from morning till night, protested that there never was so good a\nman as M’sieu’ Jean Jacques; and she cooked his favourite dishes, giving\nhim no peace until he had eaten them.",
        "The days, the weeks went on, with Jean Jacques growing thinner and\nthinner, but going about with his head up like the gold Cock of Beaugard,\nand even crowing now and then, as he had done of yore.  He faced the\ninevitable with something of his old smiling volubility; treating nothing\nof his disaster as though it really existed; signing off this asset and\nthat; disposing of this thing and that; stripping himself bare of all the\nproperties on his life’s stage, in such a manner as might have been his\nhad he been receiving gifts and not yielding up all he owned.  He chatted\nas his belongings were, figuratively speaking, being carried away–as\nthough they were mechanical, formal things to be done as he had done them\nevery day of a fairly long life; as a clerk would check off the boxes or\nparcels carried past him by the porters.  M. Fille could hardly bear to\nsee him in this mood, and the New Cure hovered round him with a mournful\nand harmlessly deceptive kindness.  But the end had to come, and\npractically all the parish was present when it came.  That was on the\nday when the contents of the Manor were sold at auction by order of the\nCourt.  One thing Jean Jacques refused absolutely and irrevocably to do\nfrom the first–refused it at last in anger and even with an oath: he\nwould not go through the Bankruptcy Court.  No persuasion had any effect.\nThe very suggestion seemed to smirch his honour.  His lawyer pleaded with\nhim, said he would be able to save something out of the wreck, and that\nhis creditors would be willing that he should take advantage of the\nprivileges of that court; but he only said in reply:",
        "“Thank you, thank you altogether, monsieur, but it is impossible–’non\npossumus, non possumus, my son,’ as the Pope said to Bonaparte.  I owe\nand I will pay what I can; and what I can’t pay now I will try to pay in\nthe future, by the cent, by the dollar, till all is paid to the last\ncopper.  It is the way with the Barbilles.  They have paid their way and\ntheir debts in honour, and it is in the bond with all the Barbilles of\nthe past that I do as they do.  If I can’t do it, then that I have tried\nto do it will be endorsed on the foot of the bill.”",
        "No one could move him, not even Judge Carcasson, who from his armchair in\nMontreal wrote a feeble-handed letter begging him to believe that it was\n\"well within his rights as a gentleman\"–this he put in at the request of\nM. Mornay–to take advantage of the privileges of the Bankruptcy Court.\nEven then Jean Jacques had only a few moments’ hesitation.  What the\nJudge said made a deep impression; but he had determined to drink the cup\nof his misfortune to the dregs.  He was set upon complete renunciation;\non going forth like a pilgrim from the place of his troubles and sorrows,\ntaking no gifts, no mercies save those which heaven accorded him.",
        "When the day of the auction came everything went.  Even his best suit\nof clothes was sold to a blacksmith, while his fur-coat was bought by a\nhorse-doctor for fifteen dollars.  Things that had been part of his life\nfor a generation found their way into hands where he would least have\nwished them to go–of those who had been envious of him, who had cheated\nor deceived him, of people with whom he had had nothing in common.  The\nred wagon and the pair of little longtailed stallions, which he had\ndriven for six years, were bought by the owner of a rival flour-mill in\nthe parish of Vilray; but his best sleigh, with its coon-skin robes, was\nbought by the widow of Palass Poucette, who bought also the famous\nbearskin which Dolores had given her at Jean Jacques’ expense, and had\nbeen returned by her to its proper owner.  The silver fruitdish, once (it\nwas said) the property of the Baron of Beaugard, which each generation of\nBarbilles had displayed with as much ceremony as though it was a chalice\ngiven by the Pope, went to Virginie Poucette.  Virginie also bought the\nfurniture from Zoe’s bedroom as it stood, together with the little\nupright piano on which she used to play.  The Cure bought Jean Jacques’\nwriting-desk, and M. Fille purchased his armchair, in which had sat at\nleast six Barbilles as owners of the Manor.  The beaver-hat which Jean\nJacques wore on state occasions, as his grandfather had done, together\nwith the bonnet rouge of the habitant, donned by him in his younger days\n–they fell to the nod of Mere Langlois, who declared that, as she was a\ncousin, she would keep the things in the family.  Mere Langlois would\nhave bought the fruit-dish also if she could have afforded to bid against\nVirginie Poucette; but the latter would have had the dish if it had cost\nher two hundred dollars.  The only time she had broken bread in Jean\nJacques’ house, she had eaten cake from this fruit-dish; and to her,\nas to the parish generally, the dish so beautifully shaped, with its\ngraceful depth and its fine-chased handles, was symbol of the social\ncaste of the Barbilles, as the gold Cock of Beaugard was sign of their\ncivic and commercial glory.",
        "Jean Jacques, who had moved about all day with an almost voluble\naffability, seeming not to realize the tragedy going on, or, if he\nrealized it, rising superior to it, was noticed to stand still suddenly\nwhen the auctioneer put up the fruit-dish for sale.  Then the smile left\nhis face, and the reddish glow in his eyes, which had been there since\nthe burning of the mill, fled, and a touch of amazement and confusion\ntook its place.  All in a moment he was like a fluttered dweller of the\nwilds to whom comes some tremor of danger.",
        "His mouth opened as though he would forbid the selling of the heirloom;\nbut it closed again, because he knew he had no right to withhold it from\nthe hammer; and he took on a look like that which comes to the eyes of a\nchild when it faces humiliating denial.  Quickly as it came, however, it\nvanished, for he remembered that he could buy the dish himself.  He could\nbuy it himself and keep it.  .  .  .  Yet what could he do with it?  Even\nso, he could keep it.  It could still be his till better days came.",
        "The auctioneer’s voice told off the value of the fruitdish–\"As an\nheirloom, as an antique; as a piece of workmanship impossible of\nduplication in these days of no handicraft; as good pure silver, bearing\nthe head of Louis Quinze–beautiful, marvellous, historic, honourable,\"\nand Jean Jacques made ready to bid.  Then he remembered he had no money–\nhe who all his life had been able to take a roll of bills from his pocket\nas another man took a packet of letters.  His glance fell in shame, and\nthe words died on his lips, even as M. Manotel, the auctioneer, was about\nto add another five-dollar bid to the price, which already was standing\nat forty dollars.",
        "It was at this moment Jean Jacques heard a woman’s voice bidding, then\ntwo women’s voices.  Looking up he saw that one of the women was Mere\nLanglois and the other was Virginie Poucette, who had made the first bid.\nFor a moment they contended, and then Mere Langlois fell out of the\ncontest, and Virginie continued it with an ambitious farmer from the next\ncounty, who was about to become a Member of Parliament.  Presently the\nowner of a river pleasure-steamer entered into the costly emulation also,\nbut he soon fell away; and Virginie Poucette stubbornly raised the\nbidding by five dollars each time, till the silver symbol of the\nBarbilles’ pride had reached one hundred dollars.  Then she raised the\nprice by ten dollars, and her rival, seeing that he was face to face with\na woman who would now bid till her last dollar was at stake, withdrew;\nand Virginie was left triumphant with the heirloom.",
        "At the moment when Virginie turned away with the handsome dish from M.\nManotel, and the crowd cheered her gaily, she caught Jean-Jacques’ eye,\nand she came straight towards him.  She wanted to give the dish to him\nthen and there; but she knew that this would provide annoying gossip for\nmany a day, and besides, she thought he would refuse.  More than\nthat, she had in her mind another alternative which might in the end\nsecure the heirloom to him, in spite of all.  As she passed him,\nshe said:",
        "“At least we keep it in the parish.  If you don’t have it, well, then...”",
        "She paused, for she did not quite know what to say unless she spoke what\nwas really in her mind, and she dared not do that.",
        "“But you ought to have an heirloom,” she added, leaving unsaid what was\nher real thought and hope.  With sudden inspiration, for he saw she was\ntrying to make it easy for him, he drew the great silver-watch from his\npocket, which the head of the Barbilles had worn for generations, and\nsaid:",
        "“I have the only heirloom I could carry about with me.  It will keep time\nfor me as long as I’ll last.  The Manor clock strikes the time for the\nworld, and this watch is set by the Manor clock.”",
        "“Well said–well and truly said, M’sieu’ Jean Jacques,” remarked the lean\nwatchmaker and so-called jeweller of Vilray, who stood near.  “It is a\nwatch which couldn’t miss the stroke of Judgment Day.”",
        "It was at that moment, in the sunset hour, when the sale had drawn to a\nclose, and the people had begun to disperse, that the avocat of Vilray\nwho represented the Big Financier came to Jean Jacques and said:",
        "“M’sieu’, I have to say that there is due to you three hundred and fifty\ndollars from the settlement, excluding this sale, which will just do what\nwas expected of it.  I am instructed to give it to you from the\ncreditors.  Here it is.”",
        "He took out a roll of bills and offered it to Jean Jacques.",
        "“What creditors?” asked Jean Jacques.",
        "“All the creditors,” responded the other, and he produced a receipt for\nJean Jacques to sign.  “A formal statement will be sent you, and if there\nis any more due to you, it will be added then.  But now–well, there it\nis, the creditors think there is no reason for you to wait.”",
        "Jean Jacques did not yet take the roll of bills.  “They come from M.\nMornay?” he asked with an air of resistance, for he did not wish to be\nunder further obligations to the man who would lose most by him.",
        "The lawyer was prepared.  M. Mornay had foreseen the timidity and\nsensitiveness of Jean Jacques, had anticipated his mistaken chivalry–for\nhow could a man decline to take advantage of the Bankruptcy Court unless\nhe was another Don Quixote!  He had therefore arranged with all the\ncreditors for them to take responsibility with ’himself, though he\nprovided the cash which manipulated this settlement.",
        "“No, M’sieu’ Jean Jacques,” the lawyer replied, this comes from all the\ncreditors, as the sum due to you from all the transactions, so far as can\nbe seen as yet.  Further adjustment may be necessary, but this is the\ninterim settlement.”",
        "Jean Jacques was far from being ignorant of business, but so bemused was\nhis judgment and his intelligence now, that he did not see there was no\nbalance which could possibly be his, since his liabilities vastly\nexceeded his assets.  Yet with a wave of the hand he accepted the roll of\nbills, and signed the receipt with an air which said, “These forms must\nbe observed, I suppose.”",
        "What he would have done if the three hundred and fifty dollars had not\nbeen given him, it would be hard to say, for with gentle asperity he had\ndeclined a loan from his friend M. Fille, and he had but one silver\ndollar in his pocket, or in the world.  Indeed, Jean Jacques was living\nin a dream in these dark days–a dream of renunciation and sacrifice, and\nin the spirit of one who gives up all to some great cause.  He was not\nyet even face to face with the fulness of his disaster.  Only at moments\nhad the real significance of it all come to him, and then he had shivered\nas before some terror menacing his path.  Also, as M. Mornay had said,\nhis philosophy was now in his bones and marrow rather than in his words.\nIt had, after all, tinctured his blood and impregnated his mind.  He had\nbabbled and been the egotist, and played cock o’ the walk; and now at\nlast his philosophy was giving some foundation for his feet.  Yet at\nthis auction-sale he looked a distracted, if smiling, whimsical, rather\nbustling figure of misfortune, with a tragic air of exile, of isolation\nfrom all by which he was surrounded.  A profound and wayworn loneliness\nshowed in his figure, in his face, in his eyes.",
        "The crowd thinned in time, and yet very many lingered to see the last of\nthis drama of lost fortunes.  A few of the riff-raff, who invariably\nattend these public scenes, were now rather the worse for drink, from the\nindifferent liquor provided by the auctioneer, and they were inclined to\nhorseplay and coarse chaff.  More than one ribald reference to Jean\nJacques had been checked by his chivalrous fellow-citizens; indeed, M.\nFille had almost laid himself open to a charge of assault in his own\ncourt by raising his stick at a loafer, who made insulting references to\nJean Jacques.  But as the sale drew to a close, an air of rollicking\nhumour among the younger men would not be suppressed, and it looked as\nthough Jean Jacques’ exit would be attended by the elements of farce and\nsatire.",
        "In this world, however, things do not happen logically, and Jean Jacques\nmade his exit in a wholly unexpected manner.  He was going away by the\ntrain which left a new railway junction a few miles off, having gently\nyet firmly declined M. Fille’s invitation, and also the invitations of\nothers–including the Cure and Mere Langlois–to spend the night with\nthem and start off the next day.  He elected to go on to Montreal that\nvery night, and before the sale was quite finished he prepared to start.\nHis carpet-bag containing a few clothes and necessaries had been sent on\nto the junction, and he meant to walk to the station in the cool of the\nevening.",
        "M. Manotel, the auctioneer, hoarse with his heavy day’s work, was\nannouncing that there were only a few more things to sell, and no doubt\nthey could be had at a bargain, when Jean Jacques began a tour of the\nManor.  There was something inexpressibly mournful in this lonely\npilgrimage of the dismantled mansion.  Yet there was no show of cheap\nemotion by Jean Jacques; and a wave of the hand prevented any one from\nfollowing him in his dry-eyed progress to say farewell to these haunts of\nchildhood, manhood, family, and home.  There was a strange numbness in\nhis mind and body, and he had a feeling that he moved immense and\nreflective among material things.  Only tragedy can produce that feeling.\nHappiness makes the universe infinite and stupendous, despair makes it\nsmall and even trivial.",
        "It was when he had reached the little office where he had done the\nbusiness of his life–a kind of neutral place where he had ever isolated\nhimself from the domestic scene–that the final sensation, save one, of\nhis existence at the Manor came to him.  Virginie Poucette had divined\nhis purpose when he began the tour of the house, and going by a\nroundabout way, she had placed herself where she could speak with him\nalone before he left the place for ever–if that was to be.  She was not\nsure that his exit was really inevitable–not yet.",
        "When Jean Jacques saw Virginie standing beside the table in his office\nwhere he lead worked over so many years, now marked Sold, and waiting to\nbe taken away by its new owner, he started and drew back, but she held\nout her hand and said:",
        "“But one word, M’sieu’ Jean Jacques; only one word from a friend–indeed\na friend.”",
        "“A friend of friends,” he answered, still in abstraction, his eyes having\nthat burnished light which belonged to the night of the fire; but yet\nrealizing that she was a sympathetic soul who had offered to lend him\nmoney without security.",
        "“Oh, indeed yes, as good a friend as you can ever have!” she added.",
        "Something had waked the bigger part of her, which had never been awake in\nthe days of Palass Poucette.  Jean Jacques was much older than she, but\nwhat she felt had nothing to do with age, or place or station.  It had\nonly to do with understanding, with the call of nature and of a\nmotherhood crying for expression.  Her heart ached for him.",
        "“Well, good-bye, my friend,” he said, and held out his hand.  “I must be\ngoing now.”",
        "“Wait,” she said, and there was something insistent and yet pleading in\nher voice.  “I’ve got something to say.  You must hear it.  .  .  .  Why\nshould you go?  There is my farm–it needs to be worked right.  It has\ngot good chances.  It has water-power and wood and the best flax in the\nprovince–they want to start a flax-mill on it–I’ve had letters from big\nmen in Montreal.  Well, why shouldn’t you do it instead?  There it is,\nthe farm, and there am I a woman alone.  I need help.  I’ve got no head.\nI have to work at a sum of figures all night to get it straight.  .  .  .\nAh, m’sieu’, it is a need both sides!  You want someone to look after\nyou; you want a chance again to do things; but you want someone to look\nafter you, and it is all waiting there on the farm.  Palass Poucette left\nbehind him seven sound horses, and cows and sheep, and a threshing-\nmachine and a fanning-mill, and no debts, and two thousand dollars in the\nbank.  You will never do anything away from here.  You must stay here,\nwhere–where I can look after you, Jean Jacques.”",
        "The light in his eyes flamed up, died down, flamed up again, and\npresently it covered all his face, as he grasped what she meant.",
        "“Wonder of God, do you forget?” he asked.  “I am married–married still,\nVirginie Poucette.  There is no divorce in the Catholic Church–no, none\nat all.  It is for ever and ever.”",
        "“I said nothing about marriage,” she said bravely, though her face\nsuffused.",
        "“Hand of Heaven, what do you mean?  You mean to say you would do that for\nme in spite of the Cure and–and everybody and everything?”",
        "“You ought to be taken care of,” she protested.  “You ought to have your\nchance again.  No one here is free to do it all but me.  You are alone.\nYour wife that was–maybe she is dead.  I am alone, and I’m not afraid of\nwhat the good God will say.  I will settle with Him myself.  Well, then,\ndo you think I’d care what–what Mere Langlois or the rest of the world\nwould say?  .  .  .  I can’t bear to think of you going away with\nnothing, with nobody, when here is something and somebody–somebody\nwho would be good to you.  Everybody knows that you’ve been badly used–\neverybody.  I’m young enough to make things bright and warm in your life,\nand the place is big enough for two, even if it isn’t the Manor Cartier.”",
        "“Figure de Christ, do you think I’d let you do it–me?” declared Jean\nJacques, with lips trembling now and his shoulders heaving.  Misfortune\nand pain and penalty he could stand, but sacrifice like this and–and\nwhatever else it was, were too much for him.  They brought him back to\nthe dusty road and everyday life again; they subtracted him from his big\ndream, in which he had been detached from the details of his catastrophe.",
        "“No, no, no,” he added.  “You go look another way, Virginie.  Turn your\nface to the young spring, not to the dead winter.  To-morrow I’ll be gone\nto find what I’ve got to find.  I’ve finished here, but there’s many a\ngood man waiting for you–men who’ll bring you something worth while\nbesides themselves.  Make no mistake, I’ve finished.  I’ve done my term\nof life.  I’m only out on ticket-of-leave now–but there, enough, I shall\nalways want to think of you.  I wish I had something to give you–but\nyes, here is something.”  He drew from his pocket a silver napkin-ring.\n\"I’ve had that since I was five years old.  My uncle Stefan gave it to\nme.  I’ve always used it.  I don’t know why I put it in my pocket this\nmorning, but I did.  Take it.  It’s more than money.  It’s got something\nof Jean Jacques about it.  You’ve got the Barbille fruit-dish-that is a\nthing I’ll remember.  I’m glad you’ve got it, and–”",
        "“I meant we should both eat from it,” she said helplessly.",
        "“It would cost too much to eat from it with you, Virginie–”",
        "He stopped short, choked, then his face cleared, and his eyes became\nsteady.",
        "“Well then, good-bye, Virginie,” he said, holding out his hand.",
        "“You don’t think I’d say to any other living man what I’ve said to you?\"\nshe asked.",
        "He nodded understandingly.  “That’s the best part of it.  It was for me\nof all the world,” he answered.  “When I look back, I’ll see the light\nin your window–the light you lit for the lost one–for Jean Jacques\nBarbille.”",
        "Suddenly, with eyes that did not see and hands held out before him, he\nturned, felt for the door and left the room.",
        "She leaned helplessly against the table.  “The poor Jean Jacques–the\npoor Jean Jacques!” she murmured.  “Cure or no Cure, I’d have done it,\"\nshe declared, with a ring to her voice.  “Ah, but Jean Jacques, come with\nme!” she added with a hungry and compassionate gesture, speaking into\nspace.  “I could make life worth while for us both.”",
        "A moment later Virginie was outside, watching the last act in the career\nof Jean Jacques in the parish of St. Saviour’s.",
        "This was what she saw.",
        "The auctioneer was holding up a bird-cage containing a canary-Carmen’s\nbird-cage, and Zoe’s canary which had remained to be a vocal memory of\nher in her old home.",
        "“Here,” said the rhetorical, inflammable auctioneer, “here is the\nchoicest lot left to the last.  I put it away in the bakery, meaning to\nsell it at noon, when everybody was eating-food for the soul and food for\nthe body.  I forgot it.  But here it is, worth anything you like to\nanybody that loves the beautiful, the good, and the harmonious.  What do\nI hear for this lovely saffron singer from the Elysian fields?  What did\nthe immortal poet of France say of the bird in his garret, in ’L’Oiseau\nde Mon Crenier’?  What did he say:",
        "                   ’Sing me a song of the bygone hour,\n                    A song of the stream and the sun;\n                    Sing of my love in her bosky bower,\n                    When my heart it was twenty-one.’",
        "“Come now, who will renew his age or regale her youth with the divine\nnotes of nature’s minstrel?  Who will make me an offer for this vestal\nvirgin of song–the joy of the morning and the benediction of the\nevening?  What do I hear?  The best of the wine to the last of the feast!\nWhat do I hear?–five dollars–seven dollars–nine dollars–going at nine\ndollars–ten dollars–Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bird can sing–ah,\nvoila !”",
        "He stopped short for a moment, for as the evening sun swept its veil of\nrainbow radiance over the scene, the bird began to sing.  Its little\nthroat swelled, it chirruped, it trilled, it called, it soared, it lost\nitself in a flood of ecstasy.  In the applausive silence, the emotional\nrecess of the sale, as it were, the man to whom the bird and the song\nmeant most, pushed his way up to the stand where M. Manotel stood.  When\nthe people saw who it was, they fell back, for there was that in his face\nwhich needed no interpretation.  It filled them with a kind of awe.",
        "He reached up a brown, eager, affectionate hand–it had always been that\n–fat and small, but rather fine and certainly emotional, though not\nmaterial or sensual.",
        "“Go on with your bidding,” he said.",
        "He was going to buy the thing which had belonged to his daughter, was\nbeloved by her–the living oracle of the morning, the muezzin of his\nmosque of home.  It had been to the girl who had gone as another such a\nbird had been to the mother of the girl, the voice that sang, “Praise\nGod,” in the short summer of that bygone happiness of his.  Even this\ncage and its homebird were not his; they belonged to the creditors.",
        "“Go on.  I buy–I bid,” Jean Jacques said in a voice that rang.  It had\nno blur of emotion.  It had resonance.  The hammer that struck the bell\nof his voice was the hammer of memory, and if it was plaintive it also\nwas clear, and it was also vibrant with the silver of lost hopes.",
        "M. Manotel humoured him, while the bird still sang.  “Four dollars–five\ndollars: do I hear no more than five dollars?–going once, going twice,\ngoing three times–gone!” he cried, for no one had made a further bid;\nand indeed M. Manotel would not have heard another voice than Jean\nJacques’ if it had been as loud as the falls of the Saguenay.  He was a\nkind of poet in his way, was M. Manotel.  He had been married four times,\nand he would be married again if he had the chance; also he wrote verses\nfor tombstones in the churchyard at St. Saviour’s, and couplets for fetes\nand weddings.",
        "He handed the cage to Jean Jacques, who put it down on the ground at his\nfeet, and in an instant had handed up five dollars for one of the idols\nof his own altar.  Anyone else than M. Manotel, or perhaps M. Fille or\nthe New Cure, would have hesitated to take the five dollars, or, if they\nhad done so, would have handed it back; but they had souls to understand\nthis Jean Jacques, and they would not deny him his insistent\nindependence.  And so, in a moment, he was making his way out of the\ncrowd with the cage in his hand, the bird silent now.",
        "As he went, some one touched his arm and slipped a book into his hand.\nIt was M. Fille, and the book was his little compendium of philosophy\nwhich his friend had retrieved from his bedroom in the early morning.",
        "“You weren’t going to forget it, Jean Jacques?” M. Fille said\nreproachfully.  “It is an old friend.  It would not be happy with\nany one else.”",
        "Jean Jacques looked M. Fille in the eyes.  “Moi–je suis philosophe,” he\nsaid without any of the old insistence and pride and egotism, but as one\nwould make an affirmation or repeat a creed.",
        "“Yes, yes, to be sure, always, as of old,” answered M. Fille firmly;\nfor, from that formula might come strength, when it was most needed,\nin a sense other and deeper far than it had been or was now.  “You will\nremember that you will always know where to find us–eh?” added the\nlittle Clerk of the Court.",
        "The going of Jean Jacques was inevitable; all persuasion had failed to\ninduce him to stay–even that of Virginie; and M. Fille now treated it\nas though it was the beginning of a new career for Jean Jacques, whatever\nthat career might be.  It might be he would come back some day, but not\nto things as they were, not ever again, nor as the same man.",
        "“You will move on with the world outside there,” continued M. Fille,\n\"but we shall be turning on the same swivel here always; and whenever you\ncome–there, you understand.  With us it is semper fidelis, always the\nsame.”",
        "Jean Jacques looked at M. Fille again as though to ask him a question,\nbut presently he shook his head in negation to his thought.",
        "“Well, good-bye,” he said cheerfully–\"A la bonne heure!”",
        "By that M. Fille knew that Jean Jacques did not wish for company as he\nwent–not even the company of his old friend who had loved the bright\nwhimsical emotional Zoe; who had hovered around his life like a\nprotecting spirit.",
        "“A bi’tot,” responded M. Fille, declining upon the homely patois.",
        "But as Jean Jacques walked away with his little book of philosophy in his\npocket, and the bird-cage in his hand, someone sobbed.  M. Fille turned\nand saw.  It was Virginie Poucette.  Fortunately for Virginie other women\ndid the same, not for the same reason, but out of a sympathy which was\npart of the scene.",
        "It had been the intention of some friends of Jean Jacques to give him\na cheer when he left, and even his sullen local creditors, now that the\nworst had come, were disposed to give him a good send-off; but the\nincident of the canary in its cage gave a turn to the feeling of the\ncrowd which could not be resisted.  They were not a people who could cut\nand dry their sentiments; they were all impulse and simplicity, with an\nobvious cocksure shrewdness too, like that of Jean Jacques–of the old\nJean Jacques.  He had been the epitome of all their faults and all their\nvirtues.",
        "No one cheered.  Only one person called, “Au ’voir, M’sieu’ Jean\nJacques!” and no one followed him–a curious, assertive, feebly-brisk,\nshock-headed figure in the brown velveteen jacket, which he had bought in\nParis on his Grand Tour.",
        "“What a ridiculous little man!” said a woman from Chalfonte over the\nwater, who had been buying freely all day for her new “Manor,” her\nhusband being a member of the provincial legislature.",
        "The words were no sooner out of her mouth than two women faced her\nthreateningly.",
        "“For two pins I’d slap your face,” said old Mere Langlois, her great\nbreast heaving.  “Popinjay–you, that ought to be in a cage like his\ncanary.”",
        "But Virginie Poucette also was there in front of the offender, and she\nalso had come from Chalfonte–was born in that parish; and she knew what\nshe was facing.",
        "“Better carry a bird-cage and a book than carry swill to swine,” she\nsaid; and madame from Chalfonte turned white, for it had been said that\nher father was once a swine-herd, and that she had tried her best to\nforget it when, with her coarse beauty, she married the well-to-do\nfarmer who was now in the legislature.",
        "“Hold your tongues, all of you, and look at that,” said M. Manotel, who\nhad joined the agitated group.  He was pointing towards the departing\nJean Jacques, who was now away upon his road.",
        "Jean Jacques had raised the cage on a level with his face, and was\nevidently speaking to the bird in the way birds love–that soft kissing\nsound to which they reply with song.",
        "Presently there came a chirp or two, and then the bird thrust up its\nhead, and out came the full blessedness of its song, exultant, home-like,\nintimate.",
        "Jean Jacques walked on, the bird singing by his side; and he did not look\nback.",
        "Nothing stops when we stop for a time, or for all time, except ourselves.\nEverything else goes on–not in the same way; but it does go on.  Life\ndid not stop at St. Saviour’s after Jean Jacques made his exit.  Slowly\nthe ruined mill rose up again, and very slowly indeed the widow of Palass\nPoucette recovered her spirits, though she remained a widow in spite of\nall appeals; but M. Fille and his sister never were the same after they\nlost their friend.  They had great comfort in the dog which Jean Jacques\nhad given to them, and they roused themselves to a malicious pleasure\nwhen Bobon, as he had been called by Zoe, rushed out at the heels of an\nimportunate local creditor who had greatly worried Jean Jacques at the\nlast.  They waited in vain for a letter from Jean Jacques, but none came;\nnor did they hear anything from him, or of him, for a long, long time.",
        "Jean Jacques did not mean that they should.  When he went away with his\nbook of philosophy and his canary he had but one thing in his mind, and\nthat was to find Zoe and make her understand that he knew he had been in\nthe wrong.  He had illusions about starting life again, in which he\nprobably did not believe; but the make-believe was good for him.  Long\nbefore the crash came, in Zoe’s name–not his own–he had bought from the\nGovernment three hundred and twenty acres of land out near the Rockies\nand had spent five hundred dollars in improvements on it.",
        "There it was in the West, one remaining asset still his own–or rather\nZoe’s–but worth little if he or she did not develop it.  As he left St.\nSaviour’s, however, he kept fixing his mind on that “last domain,” as he\ncalled it to himself.  If this was done intentionally, that he might be\nsaved from distraction and despair, it was well done; if it was a real\nillusion–the old self-deception which had been his bane so often in the\npast–it still could only do him good at the present.  It prevented him\nfrom noticing the attention he attracted on the railway journey from St.\nSaviour’s to Montreal, cherishing his canary and his book as he went.",
        "He was not so self-conscious now as in the days when he was surprised\nthat Paris did not stop to say, “Bless us, here is that fine fellow, Jean\nJacques Barbille of St. Saviour’s!”  He could concentrate himself more\nnow on things that did not concern the impression he was making on the\nworld.  At present he could only think of Zoe and of her future.",
        "When a patronizing and aggressive commercial traveller in the little\nhotel on a side-street where he had taken a room in Montreal said to him,\n\"Bien, mon vieux” (which is to say, “Well, old cock”), “aren’t you a long\nway from home?” something of a new dignity came into Jean Jacques’\nbearing, very different from the assurance of the old days, and in reply\nhe said:",
        "“Not so far that I need be careless about my company.”  This made the\nlandlady of the little hotel laugh quite hard, for she did not like the\nbraggart “drummer” who had treated her with great condescension for a\nnumber of years.  Also Madame Glozel liked Jean Jacques because of his\ncanary.  She thought there must be some sentimental reason for a man of\nfifty or more carrying a bird about with him; and she did not rest until\nshe had drawn from Jean Jacques that he was taking the bird to his\ndaughter in the West.  There, however, madame was stayed in her search\nfor information.  Jean Jacques closed up, and did but smile when she\nadroitly set traps for him, and at last asked him outright where his\ndaughter was.",
        "Why he waited in Montreal it would be hard to say, save that it was a\nkind of middle place between the old life and the new, and also because\nhe must decide what was to be his plan of search.  First the West–first\nWinnipeg, but where after that?  He had at last secured information of\nwhere Zoe and Gerard Fynes had stayed while in Montreal; and now he\nfollowed clues which would bring him in touch with folk who knew them.\nHe came to know one or two people who were with Zoe and Gerard in the\nlast days they spent in the metropolis, and he turned over and over in\nhis mind every word said about his girl, as a child turns a sweetmeat in\nits mouth.  This made him eager to be off; but on the very day he decided\nto start at once for the West, something strange happened.",
        "It was towards the late afternoon of a Saturday, when the streets were\nfull of people going to and from the shops in a marketing quarter, that\nMadame Glozel came to him and said:",
        "“M’sieu’, I have an idea, and you will not think it strange, for you have\na kind heart.  There is a woman–look you, it is a sad, sad story hers.\nShe is ill and dying in a room a little way down the street.  But yes,\nI am sure she is dying–of heart disease it is.  She came here first when\nthe illness took her, but she could not afford to stay.  She went to\nthose cheaper lodgings down the street.  She used to be on the stage\nover in the States, and then she came back here, and there was a man–\nmarried to him or not I do not know, and I will not think.  Well, the\nman–the brute–he left her when she got ill–but yes, forsook her\nabsolutely!  He was a land-agent or something like that, and all very\nfine to your face, to promise and to pretend–just make-believe.  When\nher sickness got worse, off he went with ’Au revoir, my dear–I will be\nback to supper.’  Supper!  If she’d waited for her supper till he came\nback, she’d have waited as long as I’ve done for the fortune the gipsy\npromised me forty years ago.  Away he went, the rogue, without a thought\nof her, and with another woman.  That’s what hurt her most of all.\nStraight from her that could hardly drag herself about–ah, yes, and has\nbeen as handsome a woman as ever was!–straight from her he went to a\nslut.  She was a slut, m’sieu’–did I not know her?  Did Ma’m’selle Slut\nnot wait at table in this house and lead the men a dance here night and\nday-day and night till I found it out!  Well, off he went with the slut,\nand left the lady behind.  .  .  .  You men, you treat women so.”",
        "Jean Jacques put out a hand as though to argue with her.  “Sometimes it\nis the other way,” he retorted.  “Most of us have seen it like that.”",
        "“Well, for sure, you’re right enough there, m’sieu’,” was the response.\n\"I’ve got nothing to say to that, except that it’s a man that runs away\nwith a woman, or that gets her to leave her husband when she does go.\nThere’s always a man that says, ’Come along, I’m the better chap for\nyou.’”",
        "Jean Jacques wearily turned his head away towards the cage where his\ncanary was beginning to pipe its evening lay.",
        "“It all comes to the same thing in the end,” he said pensively; and then\nhe who had been so quiet since he came to the little hotel–Glozel’s,\nit was called–began to move about the room excitedly, running his\nfingers through his still bushy hair, which, to his credit, was always\nas clean as could be, burnished and shiny even at his mid-century period.\nHe began murmuring to himself, and a frown settled on his fore head.\nMme. Glozel saw that she had perturbed him, and that no doubt she had\nroused some memories which made sombre the sunny little room where the\ncanary sang; where, to ravish the eyes of the pessimist, was a picture of\nLouis XVI.  going to heaven in the arms of St. Peter.",
        "When started, however, the good woman could no more “slow down” than her\nFrench pony would stop when its head was turned homewards from market.\nSo she kept on with the history of the woman down the street.",
        "“Heart disease,” she said, nodding with assurance and finality; “and we\nknow what that is–a start, a shock, a fall, a strain, and pht! off the\npoor thing goes.  Yes, heart disease, and sometimes with such awful pain.\nBut so; and yesterday she told me she had only a hundred dollars left.\n’Enough to last me through,’ she said to me.  Poor thing, she lifted up\nher eyes with a way she has, as if looking for something she couldn’t\nfind, and she says, as simple as though she was asking about the price of\na bed-tick, ’It won’t cost more than fifty dollars to bury me, I s’pose?’\nWell, that made me squeamish, for the poor dear’s plight came home to me\nso clear, and she young enough yet to get plenty out of life, if she had\nthe chance.  So I asked her again about her people–whether I couldn’t\nsend for someone belonging to her.  ’There’s none that belongs to me,’\nshe says, ’and there’s no one I belong to.’",
        "“I thought very likely she didn’t want to tell me about herself; perhaps\nbecause she had done wrong, and her family had not been good to her.  Yet\nit was right I should try and get her folks to come, if she had any\nfolks.  So I said to her, ’Where was your home?’  And now, what do you\nthink she answered, m’sieu’?’  ’Look there,’ she said to me, with her big\neyes standing out of her head almost–for that’s what comes to her\nsometimes when she is in pain, and she looks more handsome then than at\nany other time–’Look there,’ she said to me, ’it was in heaven, that’s\nwhere–my home was; but I didn’t know it.  I hadn’t been taught to know\nthe place when I saw it.’",
        "“Well, I felt my skin go goosey, for I saw what was going on in her\nmind, and how she was remembering what had happened to her some time,\nsomewhere; but there wasn’t a tear in her eyes, and I never saw her cry-\nnever once, m’sieu’–well, but as brave as brave.  Her eyes are always\ndry–burning.  They’re like two furnaces scorching up her face.  So I\nnever found out her history, and she won’t have the priest.  I believe\nthat’s because she wants to die unknown, and doesn’t want to confess.\nI never saw a woman I was sorrier for, though I think she wasn’t married\nto the man that left her.  But whatever she was, there’s good in her–I\nhaven’t known hundreds of women and had seven sisters for nothing.  Well,\nthere she is–not a friend near her at the last; for it’s coming soon,\nthe end–no one to speak to her, except the woman she pays to come in and\nlook after her and nurse her a bit.  Of course there’s the landlady too,\nMadame Popincourt, a kind enough little cricket of a woman, but with no\nsense and no head for business.  And so the poor sick thing has not a\nsingle pleasure in the world.  She can’t read, because it makes her head\nache, she says; and she never writes to any one.  One day she tried to\nsing a little, but it seemed to hurt her, and she stopped before she had\nbegun almost.  Yes, m’sieu’, there she is without a single pleasure in\nthe long hours when she doesn’t sleep.”",
        "“There’s my canary–that would cheer her up,” eagerly said Jean Jacques,\nwho, as the story of the chirruping landlady continued, became master of\nhis agitation, and listened as though to the tale of some life for which\nhe had concern.  “Yes, take my canary to her, madame.  It picked me up\nwhen I was down.  It’ll help her–such a bird it is!  It’s the best\nsinger in the world.  It’s got in its throat the music of Malibran and\nJenny Lind and Grisi, and all the stars in heaven that sang together.\nAlso, to be sure, it doesn’t charge anything, but just as long as there’s\ndaylight it sings and sings, as you know.”",
        "“M’sieu’–oh, m’sieu’, it was what I wanted to ask you, and I didn’t\ndare!” gushingly declared madame.  “I never heard a bird sing like that\n–just as if it knew how much good it was doing, and with all the airs of\na grand seigneur.  It’s a prince of birds, that.  If you mean it,\nm’sieu’, you’ll do as good a thing as you have ever done.”",
        "“It would have to be much better, or it wouldn’t be any use,” remarked\nJean Jacques.",
        "The woman made a motion of friendliness with both hands.  “I don’t\nbelieve that.  You may be queer, but you’ve got a kind eye.  It won’t be\nfor long she’ll need the canary, and it will cheer her.  There certainly\nwas never a bird so little tied to one note.  Now this note, now that,\nand so amusing.  At times it’s as though he was laughing at you.”",
        "“That’s because, with me for his master, he has had good reason to\nlaugh,” remarked Jean Jacques, who had come at last to take a despondent\nview of himself.",
        "“That’s bosh,” rejoined Mme. Glozel; “I’ve seen several people odder than\nyou.”",
        "She went over to the cage eagerly, and was about to take it away.\n\"Excuse me,” interposed Jean Jacques, “I will carry the cage to the\nhouse.  Then you will go in with the bird, and I’ll wait outside and see\nif the little rascal sings.”",
        "“This minute?” asked madame.",
        "“For sure, this very minute.  Why should the poor lady wait?  It’s a\nlonely time of day, this, the evening, when the long night’s ahead.”",
        "A moment later the two were walking along the street to the door of Mme.\nPopincourt’s lodgings, and people turned to look at the pair, one\ncarrying something covered with a white cloth, evidently a savoury dish\nof some kind–the other with a cage in which a handsome canary hopped\nabout, well pleased with the world.",
        "At Mme.  Popincourt’s door Mme.  Glozel took the cage and went upstairs.\nJean Jacques, left behind, paced backwards and forwards in front of the\nhouse waiting and looking up, for Mme.  Glozel had said that behind the\nfront window on the third floor was where the sick woman lived.  He had\nnot long to wait.  The setting sun shining full on the window had roused\nthe bird, and he began to pour out a flood of delicious melody which\nflowed on and on, causing the people in the street to stay their steps\nand look up.  Jean Jacques’ face, as he listened, had something very like\na smile.  There was that in the smile belonging to the old pride, which\nin days gone by had made him say when he looked at his domains at the\nManor Cartier–his houses, his mills, his store, his buildings and his\nlands–\"It is all mine.  It all belongs to Jean Jacques Barbille.”",
        "Suddenly, however, there came a sharp pause in the singing, and after\nthat a cry–a faint, startled cry.  Then Mme.  Glozel’s head was thrust\nout of the window three floors up, and she called to Jean Jacques to come\nquickly.  As she bade him come, some strange premonition flashed to Jean\nJacques, and with thumping heart he hastened up the staircase.  Outside a\nbedroom door, Mme.  Glozel met him.  She was so excited she could only\nwhisper.",
        "“Be very quiet,” she said.  “There is something strange.  When the bird\nsang as it did–you heard it–she sat like one in a trance.  Then her\nface took on a look glad and frightened too, and she stared hard at the\ncage.  ’Bring that cage to me,’ she said.  I brought it.  She looked\nsharp at it, then she gave a cry and fell back.  As I took the cage away\nI saw what she had been looking at–a writing at the bottom of the cage.\nIt was the name Carmen.”",
        "With a stifled cry Jean Jacques pushed her aside and entered the room.\nAs he did so, the sick woman in the big armchair, so pale yet so splendid\nin her death-beauty, raised herself up.  With eyes that Francesca might\nhave turned to the vision of her fate, she looked at the opening door, as\nthough to learn if he who came was one she had wished to see through\nlong, relentless days.",
        "“Jean Jacques–ah, my beautiful Jean Jacques!” she cried out presently in\na voice like a wisp of sound, for she had little breath; and then with a\nsmile she sank back, too late to hear, but not too late to know, what\nJean Jacques said to her.",
        "Being generous with other people’s money\nI had to listen to him, and he had to pay me for listening\nLaw.  It is expensive whether you win or lose\nProtest that it is right when it knows that it is wrong",
        "However far Jean Jacques went, however long the day since leaving the\nManor Cartier, he could not escape the signals from his past.  He heard\nmore than once the bells of memory ringing at the touch of the invisible\nhand of Destiny which accepts no philosophy save its own.  At Montreal,\nfor one hallowed instant, he had regained his lost Carmen, but he had\nturned from her grave–the only mourners being himself, Mme. Glozel and\nMme. Popincourt, together with a barber who had coiffed her wonderful\nhair once a week–with a strange burning at his heart.  That iceberg\nwhich most mourners carry in their breasts was not his, as he walked down\nthe mountainside from Carmen’s grave.  Behind him trotted Mme. Glozel and\nMme. Popincourt, like little magpies, attendants on this eagle of sorrow\nwhose life-love had been laid to rest, her heart-troubles over.  Passion\nor ennui would no more vex her.",
        "She had had a soul, had Carmen Dolores, though she had never known it\ntill her days closed in on her, and from the dusk she looked out of the\ncasements of life to such a glowing as Jean Jacques had seen when his\nburning mill beatified the evening sky.  She had known passion and vivid\nlife in the days when she went hand-in-hand with Carvillho Gonzales\nthrough the gardens of Granada; she had known the smothering home-\nsickness which does not alone mean being sick for a distant home, but a\nsickness of the home that is; and she had known what George Masson gave\nher for one thrilling hour, and then–then the man who left her in her\ndeath-year, taking not only the last thread of hope which held her to\nlife.  This vulture had taken also little things dear to her daily life,\nsuch as the ring Carvillho Gonzales had given her long ago in Cadiz, also\nanother ring, a gift of Jean Jacques, and things less valuable to her,\nsuch as money, for which she knew surely she would have no long use.",
        "As she lay waiting for the day when she must go from the garish scene,\nshe unconsciously took stock of life in her own way.  There intruded on\nher sight the stages of the theatres where she had played and danced, and\nshe heard again the music of the paloma and those other Spanish airs\nwhich had made the world dance under her girl’s feet long ago.  At first\nshe kept seeing the faces of thousands looking up at her from the stalls,\ndown at her from the gallery, over at her from the boxes; and the hot\nbreath of that excitement smote her face with a drunken odour that sent\nher mad.  Then, alas!  somehow, as disease took hold of her, there were\nthe colder lights, the colder breath from the few who applauded so\nlittle.  And always the man who had left her in her day of direst need;\nwho had had the last warm fires of her life, the last brief outrush of\nher soul, eager as it was for a joy which would prove she had not lost\nall when she fled from the Manor Cartier–a joy which would make her\nforget!",
        "What she really did feel in this last adventure of passion only made her\nremember the more when she was alone now, her life at the Manor Cartier.\nShe was wont to wake up suddenly in the morning–the very early morning\n–with the imagined sound of the gold Cock of Beaugard crowing in her\nears.  Memory, memory, memory–yet never a word, and never a hearsay of\nwhat had happened at the Manor Cartier since she had left it!  Then there\ncame a time when she longed intensely to see Jean Jacques before she\ndied, though she could not bring herself to send word to him.  She\ndreaded what the answer might be-not Jean Jacques’ answer, but the answer\nof Life.  Jean Jacques and her child, her Zoe–more his than hers in\nyears gone by–one or both might be dead!  She dared not write, but she\ncherished a desire long denied.  Then one day she saw everything in her\nlife more clearly than she had ever done.  She found an old book of\nFrench verse, once belonging to Mme. Popincourt’s husband, who had been a\nprofessor.  Some lines therein opened up a chamber of her being never\nbefore unlocked.  At first only the feeling of the thing came, then\nslowly the spiritual meaning possessed her.  She learnt it by heart and\nlet it sing to her as she lay half-sleeping and half-waking, half-living\nand half-dying:",
        "         “There is a World; men compass it through tears,\n          Dare doom for joy of it; it called me o’er the foam;\n          I found it down the track of sundering years,\n          Beyond the long island where the sea steals home.",
        "         “A land that triumphs over shame and pain,\n          Penitence and passion and the parting breath,\n          Over the former and the latter rain,\n          The birth-morn fire and the frost of death.",
        "         “From its safe shores the white boats ride away,\n          Salving the wreckage of the portless ships\n          The light desires of the amorous day,\n          The wayward, wanton wastage of the lips.",
        "         “Star-mist and music and the pensive moon\n          These when I harboured at that perfumed shore;\n          And then, how soon!  the radiance of noon,\n          And faces of dear children at the door.",
        "         “Land of the Greater Love–men call it this;\n          No light-o’-love sets here an ambuscade;\n          No tender torture of the secret kiss\n          Makes sick the spirit and the soul afraid.",
        "         “Bright bowers and the anthems of the free,\n          The lovers absolute–ah, hear the call!\n          Beyond the long island and the sheltering sea,\n          That World I found which holds my world in thrall.",
        "         “There is a World; men compass it through tears,\n          Dare doom for joy of it; it called me o’er the foam;\n          I found it down the track of sundering years,\n          Beyond the long island where the sea steals home.”",
        "At last the inner thought of it got into her heart, and then it was in\nreply to Mme. Glozel, who asked her where her home was, she said: “In\nHeaven, but I did not know it!”  And thus it was, too, that at the very\nlast, when Jean Jacques followed the singing bird into her death-chamber,\nshe cried out, “Ah, my beautiful Jean Jacques!”",
        "And because Jean Jacques knew that, at the last, she had been his, soul\nand body, he went down from the mountain-side, the two black magpies\nfluttering mournfully and yet hopefully behind him, with more warmth at\nhis heart than he had known for years.  It never occurred to him that the\ntwo elderly magpies would jointly or severally have given the rest of\ntheir lives and their scant fortunes to have him with them either as\nhusband, or as one who honourably hires a home at so much a day.",
        "Though Jean Jacques did not know this last fact, when he fared forth\nagain he left behind his canary with Mme. Glozel; also all Carmen’s\nclothes, except the dress she died in, he gave to Mme. Popincourt, on\ncondition that she did not wear them till he had gone.  The dress in\nwhich Carmen died he wrapped up carefully, with her few jewels and her\nwedding-ring, and gave the parcel to Mme. Glozel to care for till he\nshould send for it or come again.",
        "“The bird–take him on my birthday to sing at her grave,” he said to Mme.\nGlozel just before he went West.  “It is in summer, my birthday, and you\nshall hear how he will sing there,” he added in a low voice at the very\ndoor.  Then he took out a ten-dollar bill, and would have given it to her\nto do this thing for him; but she would have none of his money.  She only\nwiped her eyes and deplored his going, and said that if ever he wanted a\nhome, and she was alive, he would know where to find it.  It sounded and\nlooked sentimental, yet Jean Jacques was never less sentimental in a very\nsentimental life.  This particular morning he was very quiet and grave,\nand not in the least agitated; he spoke like one from a friendly, sun-\nbright distance to Mme. Glozel, and also to Mme. Popincourt as he passed\nher at the door of her house.",
        "Jean Jacques had no elation as he took the Western trail; there was not\nmuch hope in his voice; but there was purpose and there was a little\nstream of peace flowing through his being–and also, mark, a stream of\nanger tumbling over rough places.  He had read two letters addressed to\nCarmen by the man–Hugo Stolphe–who had left her to her fate; and there\nwas a grim devouring thing in him which would break loose, if ever the\nman crossed his path.  He would not go hunting him, but if he passed him\nor met him on the way–!  Still he would go hunting–to find his\nCarmencita, his little Carmen, his Zoe whom he had unwittingly, God knew!\ndriven forth into the far world of the millions of acres–a wide, wide\nhunting-ground in good sooth.",
        "So he left his beloved province where he no longer had a home, and though\nno letters came to him from St. Saviour’s, from Vilray or the Manor\nCartier, yet he heard the bells of memory when the Hand Invisible\narrested his footsteps.  One day these bells rang so loud that he would\nhave heard them were he sunk in the world’s deepest well of shame; but,\nas it was, he now marched on hills far higher than the passes through the\nmountains which his patchwork philosophy had ever provided.",
        "It was in the town of Shilah on the Watloon River that the bells boomed\nout–not because he had encountered one he had ever known far down by the\nBeau Cheval, or in his glorious province, not because he had found his\nZoe, but because a man, the man–not George Masson, but the other–met\nhim in the way.",
        "Shilah was a place to which, almost unconsciously, he had deviated his\ncourse, because once Virginie Poucette had read him a letter from there.\nThat was in the office of the little Clerk of the Court at Vilray.  The\nletter was from Virginie’s sister at Shilah, and told him that Zoe and\nher husband had gone away into farther fields of homelessness.  Thus it\nwas that Shilah ever seemed to him, as he worked West, a goal in his\nquest–not the last goal perhaps, but a goal.",
        "He had been far past it by another route, up, up and out into the more\nscattered settlements, and now at last he had come to it again, having\ncompleted a kind of circle.  As he entered it, the past crowded on to him\nwith a hundred pictures.  Shilah–it was where Virginie Poucette’s sister\nlived; and Virginie had been a part of the great revelation of his life\nat St. Saviour’s.",
        "As he was walking by the riverside at Shilah, a woman spoke to him,\ntouching his arm as she did so.  He was in a deep dream as she spoke,\nbut there certainly was a look in her face that reminded him of someone\nbelonging to the old life.  For an instant he could not remember.  For a\nmoment he did not even realize that he was at Shilah.  His meditation had\nalmost been a trance, and it took him time to adjust himself to the\nknowledge of the conscious mind.  His subconsciousness was very\npowerfully alive in these days.  There was not the same ceaselessly\nactive eye, nor the vibration of the impatient body which belonged to the\nmoney-master and miller of the Manor Cartier.  Yet the eye had more depth\nand force, and the body was more powerful and vigorous than it had ever\nbeen.  The long tramping, the everlasting trail on false scents, the\nmental battling with troubles past and present, had given a fortitude and\nvigour to the body beyond what it had ever known.  In spite of his\nhomelessness and pilgrim equipment he looked as though he had a home–\nfar off.  The eyes did not smile; but the lips showed the goodness of\nhis heart–and its hardness too.  Hardness had never been there in the\nold days.  It was, however, the hardness of resentment, and not of\ncruelty.  It was not his wife’s or his daughter’s flight that he\nresented, nor yet the loss of all he had, nor the injury done him by\nSebastian Dolores.  No, his resentment was against one he had never seen,\nbut was now soon to see.  As his mind came back from the far places where\nit had been, and his eyes returned to the concrete world, he saw what the\nwoman recalled to him.  It was–yes, it was Virginie Poucette–the kind\nand beautiful Virginie–for her goodness had made him remember her as\nbeautiful, though indeed she was but comely, like this woman who stayed\nhim as he walked by the river.",
        "“You are M’sieu’ Jean Jacques Barbille?” she said questioningly.",
        "“How did you know?” he asked.  .  .  .  “Is Virginie Poucette here?”",
        "“Ah, you knew me from her?” she asked.",
        "“There was something about her–and you have it also–and the look in the\neyes, and then the lips!” he replied.",
        "Certainly they were quite wonderful, luxurious lips, and so shapely too\n–like those of Virginie.",
        "“But how did you know I was Jean Jacques Barbille?” he repeated.",
        "“Well, then it is quite easy,” she replied with a laugh almost like a\ngiggle, for she was quite as simple and primitive as her sister.  “There\nis a photographer at Vilray, and Virginie got one of your pictures there,\nand sent, it to me.  ’He may come your way,’ said Virginie to me, ’and if\nhe does, do not forget that he is my friend.’”",
        "“That she is my friend,” corrected Jean Jacques.  “And what a friend–\nmerci, what a friend!”  Suddenly he caught the woman’s arm.  “You once\nwrote to your sister about my Zoe, my daughter, that married and ran\naway–”",
        "“That ran away and got married,” she interrupted.",
        "“Is there any more news–tell me, do you know-?”",
        "But Virginie’s sister shook her head.  “Only once since I wrote Virginie\nhave I heard, and then the two poor children–but how helpless they were,\nclinging to each other so!  Well, then, once I heard from Faragay, but\nthat was much more than a year ago.  Nothing since, and they were going\non–on to Fort Providence to spend the winter–for his health–his\nlungs.”",
        "“What to do–on what to live?” moaned Jean Jacques.",
        "“His grandmother sent him a thousand dollars, so your Madame Zoe wrote\nme.”",
        "Jean Jacques raised a hand with a gesture of emotion.  “Ah, the blessed\nwoman!  May there be no purgatory for her, but Heaven at once and\nalways!”",
        "“Come home with me–where are your things?” she asked.",
        "“I have only a knapsack,” he replied.  “It is not far from here.  But I\ncannot stay with you.  I have no claim.  No, I will not, for–”",
        "“As to that, we keep a tavern,” she returned.  “You can come the same\nas the rest of the world.  The company is mixed, but there it is.  You\nneedn’t eat off the same plate, as they say in Quebec.”",
        "Quebec!  He looked at her with the face of one who saw a vision.  How\nlike Virginie Poucette–the brave, generous Virginie–how like she was!",
        "In silence now he went with her, and seeing his mood she did not talk to\nhim.  People stared as they walked along, for his dress was curious and\nhis head was bare, and his hair like the coat of a young lion.  Besides,\nthis woman was, in her way, as brave and as generous as Virginie\nPoucette.  In the very doorway of the tavern by the river a man jostled\nthem.  He did not apologize.  He only leered.  It made his foreign-\nlooking, coarsely handsome face detestable.",
        "“Pig!” exclaimed Virginie Poucette’s sister.  “That’s a man–well, look\nout!  There’s trouble brewing for him.  If he only knew!  If suspicion\ncomes out right and it’s proved–well, there, he’ll jostle the door-jamb\nof a jail.”",
        "Jean Jacques stared after the man, and somehow every nerve in his body\nbecame angry.  He had all at once a sense of hatred.  He shook the\nshoulder against which the man had collided.  He remembered the leer\non the insolent, handsome face.",
        "“I’d like to see him thrown into the river,” said Virginie Poucette’s\nsister.  “We have a nice girl here–come from Ireland–as good as can be.\nWell, last night–but there, she oughtn’t to have let him speak to her.\n’A kiss is nothing,’ he said.  Well, if he kissed me I would kill him–if\nI didn’t vomit myself to death first.  He’s a mongrel–a South American\nmongrel with nigger blood.”",
        "Jean Jacques kept looking after the man.  “Why don’t you turn him out?\"\nhe asked sharply.",
        "“He’s going away to-morrow anyhow,” she replied.  “Besides, the girl,\nshe’s so ashamed–and she doesn’t want anyone to know.  ’Who’d want to\nkiss me after him’ she said, and so he stays till to-morrow.  He’s not in\nthe tavern itself, but in the little annex next door-there, where he’s\ngoing now.  He’s only had his meals here, though the annex belongs to us\nas well.  He’s alone there on his dung-hill.”",
        "She brought Jean Jacques into a room that overlooked the river–which,\nindeed, hung on its very brink.  From the steps at its river-door, a\nlittle ferry-boat took people to the other side of the Watloon, and very\nnear–just a few hand-breadths away–was the annex where was the man who\nhad jostled Jean Jacques.",
        "A single lighted lamp, turned low, was suspended from the ceiling of the\nraftered room, and through the open doorway which gave on to a little\nwooden piazza with a slight railing and small, shaky gate came the swish\nof the Watloon River.  No moon was visible, but the stars were radiant\nand alive–trembling with life.  There was something soothing, something\nendlessly soothing in the sound of the river.  It suggested the ceaseless\nmovement of life to the final fulness thereof.",
        "So still was the room that it might have seemed to be without life, were\nit not for a faint sound of breathing.  The bed, however, was empty, and\nno chair was occupied; but on a settle in a corner beside an unused\nfireplace sat a man, now with hands clasped between his knees, again with\narms folded across his breast; but with his head always in a listening\nattitude.  The whole figure suggested suspense, vigilance and\npreparedness.  The man had taken off his boots and stockings, and his\nbare feet seemed to grip the floor; also the sleeves of his jacket were\nrolled up a little.  It was not a figure you would wish to see in your\nroom at midnight unasked.  Once or twice he sighed heavily, as he\nlistened to the river slishing past and looked out to the sparkle of the\nskies.  It was as though the infinite had drawn near to the man, or else\nthat the man had drawn near to the infinite.  Now and again he brought\nhis fists down on his knees with a savage, though noiseless, force.  The\npeace of the river and the night could not contend successfully against a\ndark spirit working in him.  When, during his vigil, he shook his shaggy\nhead and his lips opened on his set teeth, he seemed like one who would\ntake toll at a gateway of forbidden things.",
        "He started to his feet at last, hearing footsteps outside upon the\nstairs.  Then he settled back again, drawing near to the chimney-wall, so\nthat he should not be easily seen by anyone entering.  Presently there\nwas the click of a latch, then the door opened and shut, and cigar-smoke\ninvaded the room.  An instant later a hand went up to the suspended oil-\nlamp and twisted the wick into brighter flame.  As it did so, there was a\nslight noise, then the click of a lock.  Turning sharply, the man under\nthe lamp saw at the door the man who had been sitting in the corner.  The\nman had a key in his hand.  Exit now could only be had through the door\nopening on to the river.",
        "“Who are you?  What the hell do you want here?” asked the fellow under\nthe lamp, his swarthy face drawn with fear and yet frowning with anger.",
        "“Me–I am Jean Jacques Barbille,” said the other in French, putting the\nkey of the door in his pocket.  The other replied in French, with a\nSpanish-English accent.  “Barbille–Carmen’s husband!  Well, who would\nhave thought–!”",
        "He ended with a laugh not pleasant to hear, for it was coarse with\nsardonic mirth; yet it had also an unreasonable apprehension; for why\nshould he fear the husband of the woman who had done that husband such an\ninjury!",
        "“She treated you pretty bad, didn’t she–not much heart, had Carmen!\"\nhe added.",
        "“Sit down.  I want to talk to you,” said Jean Jacques, motioning to two\nchairs by a table at the side of the room.  This table was in the middle\nof the room when the man under the lamp-Hugo Stolphe was his name–had\nleft it last.  Why had the table been moved?",
        "“Why should I sit down, and what are you doing here?–I want to know\nthat,” Stolphe demanded.  Jean Jacques’ hands were opening and shutting.\n\"Because I want to talk to you.  If you don’t sit down, I’ll give you no\nchance at all.  .  .  .  Sit down!”  Jean Jacques was smaller than\nStolphe, but he was all whipcord and leather; the other was sleek and\nsoft, but powerful too; and he had one of those savage natures which go\nblind with hatred, and which fight like beasts.  He glanced swiftly round\nthe room.",
        "“There is no weapon here,” said Jean Jacques, nodding.  “I have put\neverything away–so you could not hurt me if you wanted.  .  .  .  Sit\ndown!”",
        "To gain time Stolphe sat down, for he had a fear that Jean Jacques was\narmed, and might be a madman armed–there were his feet bare on the brown\npainted boards.  They looked so strange, so uncanny.  He surely must be a\nmadman if he wanted to do harm to Hugo Stolphe; for Hugo Stolphe had only\n\"kept” the woman who had left her husband, not because of himself, but\nbecause of another man altogether–one George Masson.  Had not Carmen\nherself told him that before she and he lived together?  What grudge\ncould Carmen’s husband have against Hugo Stolphe?",
        "Jean Jacques sat down also, and, leaning on the table said: “Once I was a\nfool and let the other man escape-George Masson it was.  Because of what\nhe did, my wife left me.”",
        "His voice became husky, but he shook his throat, as it were, cleared it,\nand went on.  “I won’t let you go.  I was going to kill George Masson–I\nhad him like that!”  He opened and shut his hand with a gesture of fierce\npossession.  “But I did not kill him.  I let him go.  He was so clever–\ncleverer than you will know how to be.  She said to me–my wife said to\nme, when she thought I had killed him, ’Why did you not fight him?  Any\nman would have fought him.’  That was her view.  She was right–not to\nkill without fighting.  That is why I did not kill you at once when I\nknew.”",
        "“When you knew what?” Stolphe was staring at the madman.",
        "“When I knew you were you.  First I saw that ring–that ring on your\nhand.  It was my wife’s.  I gave it to her the first New Year after we\nmarried.  I saw it on your hand when you were drinking at the bar next\ndoor.  Then I asked them your name.  I knew it.  I had read your letters\nto my wife–”",
        "“Your wife once on a time!”",
        "Jean Jacques’ eyes swam red.  “My wife always and always–and at the last\nthere in my arms.”  Stolphe temporized.  “I never knew you.  She did not\nleave you because of me.  She came to me because–because I was there for\nher to come to, and you weren’t there.  Why do you want to do me any\nharm?”  He still must be careful, for undoubtedly the man was mad–his\neyes were too bright.",
        "“You were the death of her,” answered Jean Jacques, leaning forward.\n\"She was most ill-ah, who would not have been sorry for her!  She was\npoor.  She had been to you–but to live with a woman day by day, but to\nbe by her side when the days are done, and then one morning to say, ’Au\nrevoir till supper’ and then go and never come back, and to take money\nand rings that belonged to her!  .  .  .  That was her death–that was\nthe end of Carmen Barbille; and it was your fault.”",
        "“You would do me harm and not hurt her!  Look how she treated you–and\nothers.”",
        "Jean Jacques half rose from his seat in sudden rage, but he restrained\nhimself, and sat down again.  “She had one husband–only one.  It was\nJean Jacques Barbille.  She could only treat one as she treated me–me,\nher husband.  But you, what had you to do with that!  You used her–so!\"\nHe made a motion as though to stamp out an insect with his foot.\n\"Beautiful, a genius, sick and alone–no husband, no child, and you used\nher so!  That is why I shall kill you to-night.  We will fight for it.”",
        "Yes, but surely the man was mad, and the thing to do was to humour him,\nto gain time.  To humour a madman–that is what one always advised,\ntherefore Stolphe would make the pourparler, as the French say.",
        "“Well, that’s all right,” he rejoined, “but how is it going to be done?\nHave you got a pistol?”  He thought he was very clever, and that he would\nnow see whether Jean Jacques Barbille was armed.  If he was not armed,\nwell, then, there would be the chances in his favour; it wasn’t easy to\nkill with hands alone.",
        "Jean Jacques ignored the question, however.  He waved a hand impatiently,\nas though to dismiss it.  “She was beautiful and splendid; she had been a\nqueen down there in Quebec.  You lied to her, and she was blind at first\n–I can see it all.  She believed so easily–but yes, always!  There\nshe was what she was, and you were what you are, not a Frenchman, not\nCatholic, and an American–no, not an American–a South American.  But\nno, not quite a South American, for there was the Portuguese nigger in\nyou–Sit down!”",
        "Jean Jacques was on his feet bending over the enraged mongrel.  He had\nspoken the truth, and Carmen’s last lover had been stung as though a\nserpent’s tooth was in his flesh.  Of all things that could be said about\nhim, that which Jean Jacques said was the worst–that he was not all\nwhite, that he had nigger blood!  Yet it was true; and he realized that\nJean Jacques must have got his information in Shilah itself where he had\nbeen charged with it.  Yet, raging as he was, and ready to take the\nJohnny Crapaud–that is the name by which he had always called Carmen’s\nhusband–by the throat, he was not yet sure that Jean Jacques was\nunarmed.  He sat still under an anger greater than his own, for there\nwas in it that fanaticism which only the love or hate of a woman could\nbreed in a man’s mind.",
        "Suddenly Stolphe laughed outright, a crackling, mirthless, ironical\nlaugh; for it really was absurdity made sublime that this man, who had\nbeen abandoned by his wife, should now want to kill one who had abandoned\nher!  This outdid Don Quixote over and over.",
        "“Well, what do you want?” he asked.",
        "“I want you to fight,” said Jean Jacques.  “That is the way.  That was\nCarmen’s view.  You shall have your chance to live, but I shall throw you\nin the river, and you can then fight the river.  The current is swift,\nthe banks are steep and high as a house down below there.  Now, I am\nready.  .  .  .  !”",
        "He had need to be, for Stolphe was quick, kicking the chair from beneath\nhim, and throwing himself heavily on Jean Jacques.  He had had his day at\nthat in South America, and as Jean Jacques Barbille had said, the water\nwas swift and deep, and the banks of the Watloon high and steep!",
        "But Jean Jacques was unconscious of everything save a debt to be\ncollected for a woman he had loved, a compensation which must be taken in\nflesh and blood.  Perhaps at the moment, as Stolphe had said to himself,\nhe was a little mad, for all his past, all his plundered, squandered,\nspoiled life was crying out at him like a hundred ghosts, and he was\nfighting with beasts at Ephesus.  An exaltation possessed him.  Not since\nthe day when his hand was on the lever of the flume with George Masson\nbelow; not since the day he had turned his back for ever on the Manor\nCartier had he been so young and so much his old self-an egotist, with\nall the blind confidence of his kind; a dreamer inflamed into action with\nall a mad dreamer’s wild power.  He was not fifty-two years of age, but\nthirty-two at this moment, and all the knowledge got of the wrestling\nriver-drivers of his boyhood, when he had spent hours by the river\nstruggling with river-champions, came back to him.  It was a relief to\nhis sick soul to wrench and strain, and propel and twist and force\nonward, step by step, to the door opening on the river, this creature who\nhad left his Carmen to die alone.",
        "“No, you don’t–not yet.  The jail before the river!” called a cool,\nsharp, sour voice; and on the edge of the trembling platform overhanging\nthe river, Hugo Stolphe was dragged back from the plunge downward he was\nabout to take, with Jean Jacques’ hand at his throat.",
        "Stolphe had heard the door of the bedroom forced, but Jean Jacques had\nnot heard it; he was only conscious of hands dragging him back just at\nthe moment of Stolphe’s deadly peril.",
        "“What is it?” asked Jean Jacques, seeing Stolphe in the hands of two\nmen, and hearing the snap of steel.  “Wanted for firing a house for\ninsurance–wanted for falsifying the accounts of a Land Company–wanted\nfor his own good, Mr. Hugo Stolphe, C.O.D.–collect on delivery!” said\nthe officer of the law.  “And collected just in time!”",
        "“We didn’t mean to take him till to-morrow,” the officer added, “but out\non the river one of us saw this gladiator business here in the red-light\nzone, and there wasn’t any time to lose.  .  .  .  I don’t know what your\nbusiness with him was,” the long-moustached detective said to Jean\nJacques, “but whatever the grudge is, if you don’t want to appear in\ncourt in the morning, the walking’s good out of town night or day–so\nlong!”",
        "He hustled his prisoner out.",
        "Jean Jacques did not want to appear in court, and as the walking was\nofficially good at dawn, he said good-bye to Virginie Poucette’s sister\nthrough the crack of a door, and was gone before she could restrain him.",
        "“Well, things happen that way,” he said, as he turned back to look at\nShilah before it disappeared from view.",
        "“Ah, the poor, handsome vaurien!” the woman at the tavern kept saying to\nher husband all that day; and she could not rest till she had written to\nVirginie how Jean Jacques came to Shilah in the evening, and went with\nthe dawn.",
        "The Young Doctor of Askatoon had a good heart, and he was exercising it\nhonourably one winter’s day near three years after Jean Jacques had left\nSt. Saviour’s.",
        "“There are many French Canadians working on the railway now, and a good\nmany habitant farmers live hereabouts, and they have plenty of children\n–why not stay here and teach school?  You are a Catholic, of course,\nmonsieur?”",
        "This is what the Young Doctor said to one who had been under his anxious\ncare for a few, vivid days.  The little brown-bearded man with the grey-\nbrown hair nodded in reply, but his gaze was on the billowing waste of\nsnow, which stretched as far as eye could see to the pine-hills in the\nfar distance.  He nodded assent, but it was plain to be seen that the\nYoung Doctor’s suggestion was not in tune with his thought.  His nod only\nacknowledged the reasonableness of the proposal.  In his eyes, however,\nwas the wanderlust which had possessed him for three long years, in which\nhe had been searching for what to him was more than Eldorado, for it was\nhope and home.  Hope was all he had left of the assets which had made him\nso great a figure–as he once thought–in his native parish of St.\nSaviour’s.  It was his fixed idea–une idee fixe, as he himself said.\nLands, mills, manor, lime-kilns, factories, store, all were gone, and his\nwife Carmen also was gone.  He had buried her with simple magnificence\nin Montreal–Mme.  Glozel had said to her neighbours afterwards that the\nfuneral cost over seventy-five dollars–and had set up a stone to her\nmemory on which was carved, “Chez nous autrefois, et chez Dieu\nmaintenant\"–which was to say, “Our home once, and God’s Home now.”",
        "That done, with a sorrow which still had the peace of finality in his\nmind, he had turned his face to the West.  His long, long sojourning had\nbrought him to Shilah where a new chapter of his life was closed, and at\nlast to Askatoon, where another chapter still closed an epoch in his\nlife, and gave finality to all.  There he had been taken down with\ncongestion of the lungs, and, fainting at the door of a drug-store, had\nbeen taken possession of by the Young Doctor, who would not send him to\nthe hospital.  He would not send him there because he found inside the\nwaistcoat of this cleanest tramp–if he was a tramp–that he had ever\nseen, a book of philosophy, the daguerreotype photo of a beautiful\nforeign-looking woman, and some verses in a child’s handwriting.  The\nbook of philosophy was underlined and interlined on every page, and every\nmargin had comment which showed a mind of the most singular simplicity,\nsearching wisdom, and hopeless confusion, all in one.",
        "The Young Doctor was a man of decision, and he had whisked the little\nbrown-grey sufferer to his own home, and tended him there like a brother\ntill the danger disappeared; and behold he was rewarded for his humanity\nby as quaint an experience as he had ever known.  He had not succeeded–\nthough he tried hard–in getting at the history of his patient’s life;\nbut he did succeed in reading the fascinating story of a mind; for Jean\nJacques, if not so voluble as of yore, had still moments when he seemed\nto hypnotize himself, and his thoughts were alive in an atmosphere of\nintellectual passion ill in accord with his condition.",
        "Presently the little brown man withdrew his eyes from the window of the\nYoung Doctor’s office and the snowy waste beyond.  They had a curious red\nunderglow which had first come to them an evening long ago, when they\ncaught from the sky the reflection of a burning mill.  There was distance\nand the far thing in that underglow of his eyes.  It had to do with the\nhorizon, not with the place where his feet were.  It said, “Out there,\nbeyond, is what I go to seek, what I must find, what will be home to me.”",
        "“Well, I must be getting on,” he said in a low voice to the Young Doctor,\nignoring the question which had been asked.",
        "“If you want work, there’s work to be had here, as I said,” responded the\nYoung Doctor.  “You are a man of education–”",
        "“How do you know that?” asked Jean Jacques.",
        "“I hear you speak,” answered the other, and then Jean Jacques drew\nhimself up and threw back his head.  He had ever loved appreciation, not\nto say flattery, and he had had very little of it lately.",
        "“I was at Laval,” he remarked with a flash of pride.  “No degree, but a\nyear there, and travel abroad–the Grand Tour, and in good style, with\nplenty to do it with.  Oh, certainly, no thought for sous, hardly for\nfrancs!  It was gold louis abroad and silver dollars at home–that was\nthe standard.”",
        "“The dollars are much scarcer now, eh?” asked the Young Doctor\nquizzically.",
        "“I should think I had just enough to pay you,” said the other, bridling\nup suddenly; for it seemed to him the Young Doctor had become ironical\nand mocking; and though he had been mocked much in his day, there were\ntimes when it was not easy to endure it.",
        "The truth is the Young Doctor was somewhat of an expert in human nature,\nand he deeply wanted to know the history of this wandering habitant,\nbecause he had a great compassionate liking for him.  If he could get the\nlittle man excited, he might be able to find out what he wanted.  During\nthe days in which the wanderer had been in his house, he had been far\nfrom silent, for he joked at his own suffering and kept the housekeeper\nlaughing at his whimsical remarks; while he won her heart by the\nextraordinary cleanliness of his threadbare clothes, and the perfect\norder of his scantily-furnished knapsack.  It had the exactness of one\nwho was set upon a far course and would carry it out on scientific\ncalculation.  He had been full of mocking quips and sallies at himself,\nbut from first to last he never talked.  The things he said were nothing\nmore than surface sounds, as it were–the ejaculations of a mind, not its\nlanguage or its meanings.",
        "“He’s had some strange history, this queer little man,” said the\nhousekeeper to the Young Doctor; “and I’d like to know what it is.  Why,\nwe don’t even know his name.”",
        "“So would I,” rejoined the Young Doctor, “and I’ll have a good try for\nit.”",
        "He had had his try more than once, but it had not succeeded.  Perhaps a\nlittle torture would do it, he thought; and so he had made the rather\ntactless remark about the scarcity of dollars.  Also his look was\nincredulous when Jean Jacques protested that he had enough to pay the\nfee.",
        "“When you searched me you forgot to look in the right place,” continued\nJean Jacques; and he drew from the lining of the hat he held in his hand\na little bundle of ten-dollar bills.  “Here–take your pay from them,” he\nsaid, and held out the roll of bills.  “I suppose it won’t be more than\nfour dollars a day; and there’s enough, I think.  I can’t pay you for\nyour kindness to me, and I don’t want to.  I’d like to owe you that; and\nit’s a good thing for a man himself to be owed kindness.  He remembers it\nwhen he gets older.  It helps him to forgive himself more or less for\nwhat he’s sorry for in life.  I’ve enough in this bunch to pay for board\nand professional attendance, or else the price has gone up since I had a\ndoctor before.”",
        "He laughed now, and the laugh was half-ironical, half-protesting.  It\nseemed to come from the well of a hidden past; and no past that is hidden\nhas ever been a happy past.",
        "The Young Doctor took the bills, looked at them as though they were\ncurios, and then returned them with the remark that they were of a kind\nand denomination of no use to him.  There was a twinkle in his eye as he\nsaid it.  Then he added:",
        "“I agree with you that it’s a good thing for a man to lay up a little\ncredit of kindness here and there for his old age.  Well, anything I did\nfor you was meant for kindness and nothing else.  You weren’t a bit of\ntrouble, and it was simply your good constitution and a warm room and a\nfew fly-blisters that pulled you through.  It wasn’t any skill of mine.\nGo and thank my housekeeper if you like.  She did it all.”",
        "“I did my best to thank her,” answered Jean Jacques.  “I said she\nreminded me of Virginie Palass Poucette, and I could say nothing better\nthan that, except one thing; and I’m not saying that to anybody.”",
        "The Young Doctor had a thrill.  Here was a very unusual man, with mystery\nand tragedy, and yet something above both, in his eyes.",
        "“Who was Virginie Palass Poucette?” he asked.  Jean Jacques threw out a\nhand as though to say, “Attend–here is a great thing,” and he began,\n\"Virginie Poucette–ah, there .  .  .  !”",
        "Then he paused, for suddenly there spread out before him that past, now\nso far away, in which he had lived–and died.  Strange that when he had\nmentioned Virginie’s name to the housekeeper he had no such feeling as\npossessed him now.  It had been on the surface, and he had used her name\nwithout any deep stir of the waters far down in his soul.  But the Young\nDoctor was fingering the doors of his inner life–all at once this\nconviction came to him–and the past rushed upon him with all its\ndisarray and ignominy, its sorrow, joy, elation and loss.  Not since he\nhad left the scene of his defeat, not since the farewell to his dead\nCarmen, that sweet summer day when he had put the lovely, ruined being\naway with her words, “Jean Jacques–ah, my beautiful Jean Jacques,\"\nringing in his ears, had he ever told anyone his story.  He had had a\nfeeling that, as Carmen had been restored to him without his crying out,\nor vexing others with his sad history, so would Zoe also come back to\nhim.  Patience and silence was his motto.",
        "Yet how was it that here and now there came an overpowering feeling, that\nhe must tell this healer of sick bodies the story of an invalid soul?\nThis man with the piercing dark-blue eyes before him, who looked so\nresolute, who had the air of one who could say,",
        "“This is the way to go,” because he knew and was sure; he was not to be\ndenied.",
        "“Who was Virginie Poucette?” repeated the Young Doctor insistently, yet\never so gently.  “Was she such a prize among women?  What did she do?”",
        "A flood of feeling passed over Jean Jacques’ face.  He looked at his hat\nand his knapsack lying in a chair, with a desire to seize them and fly\nfrom the inquisitor; then a sense of fatalism came upon him.  As though\nhe had received an order from within his soul, he said helplessly:",
        "“Well, if it must be, it must.”",
        "Then he swept the knapsack and his hat from the chair to the floor, and\nsat down.",
        "“I will begin at the beginning,” he said with his eyes fixed on those of\nthe Young Doctor, yet looking beyond him to far-off things.  “I will\nstart from the time when I used to watch the gold Cock of Beaugard\nturning on the mill, when I sat in the doorway of the Manor Cartier in my\npinafore.  I don’t know why I tell you, but maybe it was meant I should.\nI obey conviction.  While you are able to keep logic and conviction hand\nin hand then everything is all right.  I have found that out.  Logic,\nphilosophy are the props of life, but still you must obey the impulse of\nthe soul–oh, absolutely!  You must–”",
        "He stopped short.  “But it will seem strange to you,” he added after a\nmoment, in which the Young Doctor gestured to him to proceed, “to hear me\ntalk like this–a wayfarer–a vagabond you may think.  But in other days\nI was in places–”",
        "The Young Doctor interjected with abrupt friendliness that there was no\nneed to say he had been in high places.  It would still be apparent, if\nhe were in rags.",
        "“Then, there, I will speak freely,” rejoined Jean Jacques, and he took\nthe cherry-brandy which the other offered him, and drank it off with\ngusto.",
        "“Ah, that–that,” he said, “is like the cordials Mere Langlois used to\nsell at Vilray.  She and Virginie Poucette had a place together on the\nmarket–none better than Mere Langlois except Virginie Poucette, and she\nwas like a drink of water in the desert.  .  .  .  Well, there, I will\nbegin.  Now my father was–”",
        "It was lucky there were no calls for the Young Doctor that particular\nearly morning, else the course of Jean Jacques’ life might have been\ngreatly different from what it became.  He was able to tell his story\nfrom the very first to the last.  Had it been interrupted or unfinished\none name might not have been mentioned.  When Jean Jacques used it, the\nYoung Doctor sat up and leaned forward eagerly, while a light came into\nhis face-a light of surprise, of revelation and understanding.",
        "When Jean Jacques came to that portion of his life when manifest tragedy\nbegan–it began of course on the Antoine, but then it was not manifest–\nwhen his Carmen left him after the terrible scene with George Masson, he\npaused and said: “I don’t know why I tell you this, for it is not easy to\ntell; but you saved my life, and you have a right to know what it is you\nhave saved, no matter how hard it is to put it all before you.”",
        "It was at this point that he mentioned Zoe’s name–he had hitherto only\nspoken of her as “my daughter\"; and here it was the Young Doctor showed\nstartled interest, and repeated the name after Jean Jacques.  “Zoe! Zoe!\n–ah!” he said, and became silent again.",
        "Jean Jacques had not noticed the Young Doctor’s pregnant interruption, he\nwas so busy with his own memories of the past; and he brought the tale to\nthe day when he turned his face to the West to look for Zoe.  Then he\npaused.",
        "“And then?” the Young Doctor asked.  “There is more–there is the search\nfor Zoe ever since.”",
        "“What is there to say?” continued Jean Jacques.  “I have searched till\nnow, and have not found.”",
        "“How have you lived?” asked the other.",
        "“Keeping books in shops and factories, collecting accounts for\nstorekeepers, when they saw they could trust me, working at threshings\nand harvests, teaching school here and there.  Once I made fifty dollars\nat a railway camp telling French Canadian tales and singing chansons\nCanadiennes.  I have been insurance agent, sold lightning-rods, and been\nforeman of a gang building a mill–but I could not bear that.  Every time\nI looked up I could see the Cock of Beaugard where the roof should be.\nAnd so on, so on, first one thing and then another till now–till I came\nto Askatoon and fell down by the drug-store, and you played the good\nSamaritan.  So it goes, and I step on from here again, looking–looking.”",
        "“Wait till spring,” said the Young Doctor.  “What is the good of going on\nnow!  You can only tramp to the next town, and–”",
        "“And the next,” interposed Jean Jacques.  “But so it is my orders.”  He\nput his hand on his heart, and gathered up his hat and knapsack.",
        "“But you haven’t searched here at Askatoon.”  “Ah?  .  .  .  Ah-well,\nsurely that is so,” answered Jean Jacques wistfully.  “I had forgotten\nthat.  Perhaps you can tell me, you who know all.  Have you any news\nabout my Zoe for me?  Do you know–was she ever here?  Madame Gerard\nFynes would be her name.  My name is Jean Jacques Barbille.”",
        "“Madame Zoe was here, but she has gone,” quietly answered the Young\nDoctor.",
        "Jean Jacques dropped the hat and the knapsack.  His eyes had a glad, yet\nstaring and frightened look, for the Young Doctor’s face was not the\nbearer of good tidings.",
        "“Zoe–my Zoe!  You are sure?  .  .  .  When was she here?” he added\nhuskily.",
        "“A month ago.”",
        "“When did she go?”  Jean Jacques’ voice was almost a whisper.",
        "“A month ago.”",
        "“Where did she go?” asked Jean Jacques, holding himself steady, for he\nhad a strange dreadful premonition.",
        "“Out of all care at last,” answered the Young Doctor, and took a step\ntowards the little man, who staggered, then recovered himself.",
        "“She–my Zoe is dead!  How?” questioned Jean Jacques in a ghostly sort\nof voice, but there was a steadiness and control unlike what he had shown\nin other tragic moments.",
        "“It was a blizzard.  She was bringing her husband’s body in a sleigh to\nthe railway here.  He had died of consumption.  She and the driver of the\nsleigh went down in the blizzard.  Her body covered the child and saved\nit.  The driver was lost also.”",
        "“Her child–Zoe’s child?” quavered Jean Jacques.  “A little girl–Zoe.\nThe name was on her clothes.  There were letters.  One to her father–\nto you.  Your name is Jean Jacques Barbille, is it not?  I have that\nletter to you.  We buried her and her husband in the graveyard yonder.\"\nHe pointed.  “Everybody was there–even when they knew it was to be a\nCatholic funeral.”",
        "“Ah!  she was buried a Catholic?” Jean Jacques’ voice was not quite so\nblurred now.",
        "“Yes.  Her husband had become Catholic too.  A priest who had met them in\nthe Peace River Country was here at the time.”",
        "At that, with a moan, Jean Jacques collapsed.  He shed no tears, but he\nsat with his hands between his knees, whispering his child’s name.",
        "The Young Doctor laid a hand on his shoulder gently, but presently went\nout, shutting the door after him.  As he left the room, however, he\nturned and said, “Courage, Monsieur Jean Jacques!  Courage!”",
        "When the Young Doctor came back a half-hour later he had in his hand the\nletters found in Zoe’s pocket.  “Monsieur Jean Jacques,” he said gently\nto the bowed figure still sitting as he left him.",
        "Jean Jacques got up slowly and looked at him as though scarce\nunderstanding where he was.",
        "“The child–the child–where is my Zoe’s child?  Where is Zoe’s Zoe?\"\nhe asked in agitation.  His whole body seemed to palpitate.  His eyes\nwere all red fire.",
        "The Young Doctor did not answer Jean Jacques at once.  As he looked at\nthis wayworn fugitive he knew that another, and perhaps the final crisis\nof his life, was come to Jean Jacques Barbille, and the human pity in him\nshrank from the possible end to it all.  It was an old-world figure this,\nwith the face of a peasant troubadour and the carriage of an aboriginal–\nor an aristocrat.  Indeed, the ruin, the lonely wandering which had been\nJean Jacques’ portion, had given him that dignity which often comes to\nthose who defy destiny and the blows of angry fate.  Once there had been\nin his carriage something jaunty.  This was merely life and energy and a\nlittle vain confidence; now there was the look of courage which awaits\nthe worst the world can do.  The life which, according to the world’s\nlogic, should have made Jean Jacques a miserable figure, an ill-nourished\nvagabond, had given him a physical grace never before possessed by him.\nThe face, however, showed the ravages which loss and sorrow had made.\nIt was lined and shadowed with dark reflection, yet the forehead had a\nstrange smoothness and serenity little in accord with the rest of the\ncountenance.  It was like the snow-summit of a mountain below which are\nthe ragged escarpments of trees and rocks, making a look of storm and\nwarfare.",
        "“Where is she–the child of my Zoe?” Jean Jacques repeated with an\nalmost angry emphasis; as though the Young Doctor were hiding her from\nhim.",
        "“She is with the wife of Nolan Doyle, my partner in horse-breeding, not\nvery far from here.  Norah Doyle was married five years, and she had no\nchild.  This was a grief to her, even more than to Nolan, who, like\nher, came of a stock that was prolific.  It was Nolan who found your\ndaughter on the prairie–the driver dead, but she just alive when found.\nTo give her ease of mind, Nolan said he would make the child his own.\nWhen he said that, she smiled and tried to speak, but it was too late,\nand she was gone.”",
        "In sudden agony Jean Jacques threw up his hands.  “So young and so soon\nto be gone!” he exclaimed.  “But a child she was and had scarce tasted\nthe world.  The mercy of God–what is it!”",
        "“You can’t take time as the measure of life,” rejoined the Young Doctor\nwith a compassionate gesture.  “Perhaps she had her share of happiness–\nas much as most of us get, maybe, in a longer course.”",
        "“Share!  She was worth a hundred years of happiness!” bitterly retorted\nJean Jacques.",
        "“Perhaps she knew her child would have it?” gently remarked the Young\nDoctor.",
        "“Ah, that–that !  .  .  .  Do you think that possible, m’sieu’?  Tell\nme, do you think that was in her mind–to have loved, and been a mother,\nand given her life for the child, and then the bosom of God.  Answer that\nto me, m’sieu’?”",
        "There was intense, poignant inquiry in Jean Jacques’ face, and a light\nseemed to play over it.  The Young Doctor heeded the look and all that\nwas in the face.  It was his mission to heal, and he knew that to heal\nthe mind was often more necessary than to heal the body.  Here he would\ntry to heal the mind, if only in a little.",
        "“That might well have been in her thought,” he answered.  “I saw her\nface.  It had a wonderful look of peace, and a smile that would reconcile\nanyone she loved to her going.  I thought of that when I looked at her.\nI recall it now.  It was the smile of understanding.”",
        "He had said the only thing which could have comforted Jean Jacques\nat that moment.  Perhaps it was meant to be that Zoe’s child should\nrepresent to him all that he had lost–home, fortune, place, Carmen and\nZoe.  Perhaps she would be home again for him and all that home should\nmean–be the promise of a day when home would again include that fled\nfrom Carmen, and himself, and Carmen’s child.  Maybe it was sentiment in\nhim, maybe it was sentimentality–and maybe it was not.",
        "“Come, m’sieu’,” Jean Jacques said impatiently: “let us go to the house\nof that M’sieu’ Doyle.  But first, mark this: I have in the West here\nsome land–three hundred and twenty acres.  It may yet be to me a home,\nwhere I shall begin once more with my Zoe’s child–with my Zoe of Zoe–\nthe home-life I lost down by the Beau Cheval.  .  .  .  Let us go at\nonce.”",
        "“Yes, at once,” answered the Young Doctor.  Yet his feet were laggard,\nfor he was not so sure that there would be another home for Jean Jacques\nwith his grandchild as its star.  He was thinking of Norah, to whom a\nwaif of the prairie had made home what home should be for herself and\nNolan Doyle.",
        "“Read these letters first,” he said, and he put the letters found on Zoe\nin Jean Jacques’ eager hands.",
        "A half-hour later, at the horse-breeding ranch, the Young Doctor\nintroduced Jean Jacques to Norah Doyle, and instantly left the house.\nHe had no wish to hear the interview which must take place between the\ntwo.  Nolan Doyle was not at home, but in the room where they were shown\nto Norah was a cradle.  Norah was rocking it with one foot while,\nstanding by the table, she busied herself with sewing.",
        "The introduction was of the briefest.  “Monsieur Barbille wishes a word\nwith you, Mrs. Doyle,” said the Young Doctor.  “It’s a matter that\ndoesn’t need me.  Monsieur has been in my care, as you know.  .  .  .\nWell, there, I hope Nolan is all right.  Tell him I’d like to see him\nto-morrow about the bay stallion and the roans.  I’ve had an offer for\nthem.  Good-bye–good-bye, Mrs. Doyle\"–he was at the door–\"I hope you\nand Monsieur Barbille will decide what’s best for the child without\ndifficulty.”",
        "The door opened quickly and shut again, and Jean Jacques was alone with\nthe woman and the child.  “What’s best for the child!”",
        "That was what the Young Doctor had said.  Norah stopped rocking the\ncradle and stared at the closed door.  What had this man before her, this\ntramp habitant of whom she had heard, of course, to do with little Zoe in\nthe cradle–her little Zoe who had come just when she was most needed;\nwho had brought her man and herself close together again after an\nestrangement which neither had seemed able to prevent.",
        "“What’s best for the child!”  How did the child in the cradle\nconcern this man?  Then suddenly his name almost shrieked in her brain.\nBarbille–that was the name on the letter found on the body of the woman\nwho died and left Zoe behind–M. Jean Jacques Barbille.",
        "Yes, that was the name.  What was going to happen?  Did the man intend to\ntry and take Zoe from her?",
        "“What is your name–all of it?” she asked sharply.  She had a very fine\nset of teeth, as Jean Jacques saw mechanically; and subconsciously he\nsaid to himself that they seemed cruel, they were so white and regular–\nand cruel.  The cruelty was evident to him as she bit in two the thread\nfor the waistcoat she was mending, and then plied her needle again.  Also\nthe needle in her fingers might have been intended to sew up his shroud,\nso angry did it appear at the moment.  But her teeth had something almost\nsavage about them.  If he had seen them when she was smiling, he would\nhave thought them merely beautiful and rare, atoning for her plain face\nand flat breast–not so flat as it had been; for since the child had come\ninto her life, her figure, strangely enough, had rounded out, and lines\nnever before seen in her contour appeared.",
        "He braced himself for the contest he knew was at hand, and replied to\nher.  “My name is Jean Jacques Barbille.  I was of the Manor Cartier, in\nSt. Saviour’s parish, Quebec.  The mother of the child Zoe, there, was\nborn at the Manor Cartier.  I was her father.  I am the grandfather of\nthis Zoe.”  He motioned towards the cradle.",
        "Then, with an impulse he could not check and did not seek to check–why\nshould he?  was not the child his own by every right?–he went to the\ncradle and looked down at the tiny face on its white pillow.  There\ncould be no mistake about it; here was the face of his lost Zoe, with\nsomething, too, of Carmen, and also the forehead of the Barbilles.  As\nthough the child knew, it opened its eyes wide-big, brown eyes like those\nof Carmen Dolores.",
        "“Ah, the beautiful, beloved thing!” he exclaimed in a low-voice, ere\nNorah stepped between and almost pushed him back.  An outstretched arm in\nfront of her prevented him from stooping to kiss the child.  “Stand back.\nThe child must not be waked,” she said.  “It must sleep another hour.  It\nhas its milk at twelve o’clock.  Stand aside.  I won’t have my child\ndisturbed.”",
        "“Have my child disturbed\"–that was what she had said, and Jean Jacques\nrealized what he had to overbear.  Here was the thing which must be\nfought out at once.",
        "“The child is not yours, but mine,” he declared.  “Here is proof–the\nletter found on my Zoe when she died–addressed to me.  The doctor knew.\nThere is no mistake.”",
        "He held out the letter for her to see.  “As you can read here, my\ndaughter was on her way back to the Manor Cartier, to her old home at\nSt. Saviour’s.  She was on her way back when she died.  If she had lived\nI should have had them both; but one is left, according to the will of\nGod.  And so I will take her–this flower of the prairie–and begin life\nagain.”",
        "The face Norah turned on him had that look which is in the face of an\nanimal, when its young is being forced from it–fierce, hungering,\nfurtive, vicious.",
        "“The child is mine,” she exclaimed–\"mine and no other’s.  The prairie\ngave it to me.  It came to me out of the storm.  ’Tis mine-mine only.\nI was barren and wantin’, and my man was slippin’ from me, because there\nwas only two of us in our home.  I was older than him, and yonder was a\ngirl with hair like a sheaf of wheat in the sun, and she kept lookin’ at\nhim, and he kept goin’ to her.  ’Twas a man she wanted, ’twas a child he\nwanted, and there they were wantin’, and me atin’ my heart out with\npassion and pride and shame and sorrow.  There was he wantin’ a child,\nand the girl wantin’ a man, and I only wantin’ what God should grant all\nwomen that give themselves to a man’s arms after the priest has blessed\nthem.  And whin all was at the worst, and it looked as if he was away\nwith her–the girl yonder–then two things happened.  A man–he was me\nown brother and a millionaire if I do say it–he took her and married\nher; and then, too, Heaven’s will sent this child’s mother to her last\nend and the child itself to my Nolan’s arms.  To my husband’s arms first\nit came, you understand; and he give the child to me, as it should be,\nand said he, ’We’ll make believe it is our own.’  But I said to him,\n’There’s no make-believe.  ’Tis mine.  ’Tis mine.  It came to me out of\nthe storm from the hand of God.’ And so it was and is; and all’s well\nhere in the home, praise be to God.  And listen to me: you’ll not come\nhere to take the child away from me.  It can’t be done.  I’ll not have\nit.  Yes, you can let that sink down into you–I’ll not have it.”",
        "During her passionate and defiant appeal Jean Jacques was restless with\nthe old unrest of years ago, and his face twitched with emotion; but\nbefore she had finished he had himself in some sort of control.",
        "“You–madame, you are only thinking of yourself in this.  You are only\nthinking what you want, what you and your man need.  But it’s not to be\nlooked at that way only, and–”",
        "“Well, then it isn’t to be looked at that way only,” she interrupted.\n\"As you say, it isn’t Nolan and me alone to be considered.  There’s–”",
        "“There’s me,” he interrupted sharply.  “The child is bone of my bone.\nIt is bone of all the Barbilles back to the time of Louis XI.\"–he had\nsaid that long ago to Zoe first, and it was now becoming a fact in his\nmind.  “It is linked up in the chain of the history of the Barbilles.\nIt is one with the generations of noblesse and honour and virtue.\nIt is–”",
        "“It’s one with Abel the son of Adam, if it comes to that, and so am I,\"\nNorah bitingly interjected, while her eyes flashed fire, and she rocked\nthe cradle more swiftly than was good for the child’s sleep.",
        "Jean Jacques flared up.  “There were sons and daughters of the family of\nAdam that had names, but there were plenty others you whistled to as you\nwould to a four-footer, and they’d come.  The Barbilles had names–always\nnames of their own back to Adam.  The child is a Barbille–Don’t rock the\ncradle so fast,” he suddenly added with an irritable gesture, breaking\noff from his argument.  “Don’t you know better than that when a child’s\nasleep?  Do you want it to wake up and cry?”",
        "She flushed to the roots of her hair, for he had said something for which\nshe had no reply.  She had undoubtedly disturbed the child.  It stirred\nin its sleep, then opened its eyes, and at once began to cry.",
        "“There,” said Jean Jacques, “what did I tell you?  Any one that had ever\nhad children would know better than that.”",
        "Norah paid no attention to his mocking words, to the undoubted-truth of\nhis complaint.  Stooping over, she gently lifted the child up.  With\nhungry tenderness she laid it against her breast and pressed its cheek to\nher own, murmuring and crooning to it.",
        "“Acushla!  Acushla!  Ah, the pretty bird–mother’s sweet–mother’s\nangel!” she said softly.",
        "She rocked backwards and forwards.  Her eyes, though looking at Jean\nJacques as she crooned and coaxed and made lullaby, apparently did not\nsee him.  She was as concentrated as though it were a matter of life and\ndeath.  She was like some ancient nurse of a sovereign-child, plainly\ndressed, while the dainty white clothes of the babe in her arms–ah,\nhadn’t she raided the hoard she had begun when first married, in the hope\nof a child of her own, to provide this orphan with clothes good enough\nfor a royal princess!",
        "The flow of the long, white dress of the waif on the dark blue of Norah’s\ngown, which so matched the deep sapphire of her eyes, caught Jean\nJacques’ glance, allured his mind.  It was the symbol of youth and\ninnocence and home.  Suddenly he had a vision of the day when his own Zoe\nhad been given to the cradle for the first time, and he had done exactly\nwhat Norah had done–rocked too fast and too hard, and waked his little\none; and Carmen had taken her up in her long white draperies, and had\nrocked to and fro, just like this, singing a lullaby.  That lullaby he\nhad himself sung often afterwards; and now, with his grandchild in\nNorah’s arms there before him–with this other Zoe–the refrain of it\nkept lilting in his brain.  In the pause ensuing, when Norah stooped to\nput the pacified child again in its nest, he also stooped over the cradle\nand began to hum the words of the lullaby:",
        "         “Sing, little bird, of the whispering leaves,\n          Sing a song of the harvest sheaves;\n          Sing a song to my Fanchonette,\n          Sing a song to my Fanchonette!\n          Over her eyes, over her eyes, over her eyes of violet,\n          See the web that the weaver weaves,\n          The web of sleep that the weaver weaves–\n          Weaves, weaves, weaves!\n          Over those eyes of violet,\n          Over those eyes of my Fanchonette,\n          Weaves, weaves, weaves–\n          See the web that the weaver weaves!”",
        "For quite two minutes Jean Jacques and Norah Doyle stooped over the\ncradle, looking at Zoe’s rosy, healthy, pretty face, as though\nunconscious of each other, and only conscious of the child.  When Jean\nJacques had finished the long first verse of the chanson, and would have\nbegun another, Norah made a protesting gesture.",
        "“She’s asleep, and there’s no more need,” she said.  “Wasn’t it a good\nlullaby, madame?” Jean Jacques asked.",
        "“So, so,” she replied, on her defence again.",
        "“It was good enough for her mother,” he replied, pointing to the cradle.",
        "“It’s French and fanciful,” she retorted–\"both music and words.”",
        "“The child’s French–what would you have?” asked Jean Jacques\nindignantly.",
        "“The child’s father was English, and she’s goin’ to be English, the\ndarlin’, from now on and on and on.  That’s settled.  There’s manny an\nEnglish and Irish lullaby that’ll be sung to her hence and onward; and\nthere’s manny an English song she’ll sing when she’s got her voice, and\nis big enough.  Well, I think she’ll sing like a canary.”",
        "“Do the birds sing in English?” exclaimed Jean Jacques, with anger in\nhis face now.  Was there ever any vanity like the vanity of these people\nwho had made the conquest of Quebec, when sixteen Barbilles lost their\nlives, one of them being aide-de-camp to M. Vaudreuil, the governor!",
        "“All the canaries I ever heard sung in English,” she returned stubbornly.",
        "“How do Frenchmen understand their singing, then?” irritably questioned\nJean Jacques.",
        "“Well, in translation only,” she retorted, and with her sharp white teeth\nshe again bit the black thread of her needle, tied the end into a little\nknot, and began to mend the waistcoat which she had laid down in the\nfirst moments of the interview.",
        "“I want the child,” Jean Jacques insisted abruptly.  “I’ll wait till she\nwakes, and then I’ll wrap her up and take her away.”",
        "“Didn’t you hear me say she was to be brought up English?” asked Norah,\nwith a slowness which clothed her fiercest impulses.",
        "“Name of God, do you think I’ll let you have her!” returned Jean Jacques\nwith asperity and decision.  “You say you are alone, you and your M’sieu’\nNolan.  Well, I am alone–all alone in the world, and I need her–Mother\nof God, I need her more than I ever needed anything in my life!  You have\neach other, but I have only myself, and it is not good company.  Besides,\nthe child is mine, a Barbille of Barbilles, une legitime–a rightful\nchild of marriage.  But if it was a love-child only it would still be\nmine, being my daughter’s child.  Look you, it is no such thing.  It is\nof those who can claim inheritance back to Louis XI.  She will be to me\nthe gift of God in return for the robbery of death.”",
        "He leaned over the cradle, and his look was like that of one who had\nfound a treasure in the earth.",
        "Now she struck hard.  Yet very subtly too did she attack him.  “You–you\nare thinking of yourself, m’sieu’, only of yourself.  Aren’t you going to\nthink of the child at all?  It isn’t yourself that counts so much.\nYou’ve had your day, or the part of it that matters most.  But her time\nis not yet even begun.  It’s all–all–before her.  You say you’ll take\nher away–well, to what?  To what will you take her?  What have you got\nto give her?  What–”",
        "“I have the three hundred and twenty acres out there\"–he pointed\nwestward–\"and I will make a home and begin again with her.”",
        "“Three hundred and twenty acres–’out there’!” she exclaimed in scorn.\n\"Any one can have a farm here for the askin’.  What is that?  Is it a\nhome?  What have you got to start a home with?  Do you deny you are no\nbetter than a tramp?  Have you got a hundred dollars in the world?  Have\nyou got a roof over your head?  Have you got a trade?  You’ll take\nher where–to what?  Even if you had a home, what then?  You would have\nto get someone to look after her–some old crone, a wench maybe, who’d be\nas fit to bring up a child as I would be to–” she paused and looked\nround in helpless quest for a simile, when, in despair, she caught sight\nof Jean Jacques’ watch-chain–\"as I would be to make a watch!” she\nadded.",
        "Instinctively Jean Jacques drew out the ancient timepiece he had worn on\nthe Grand Tour; which had gone down with the Antoine and come up with\nhimself.  It gave him courage to make the fight for his own.",
        "“The good God would see that–” he began.",
        "“The good God doesn’t interfere in bringing up babies,” she retorted.\n\"That’s the work for the fathers and mothers, or godfathers and\ngodmothers.”",
        "“You are neither,” exclaimed Jean Jacques.  “You have no rights at all.”",
        "“I have no rights–eh?  I have no rights!  Look at the child.  Look at\nthe way she’s clothed.  Look at the cradle in which it lies.  It cost\nfifteen dollars; and the clothes–what they cost would keep a family half\na year.  I have no rights, is it?–I who stepped in and took the child\nwithout question, without bein’ asked, and made it my own, and treated it\nas if it was me own.  No, by the love of God, I treated it far, far\nbetter than if it had been me own.  Because a child was denied me, the\nhunger of the years made me love the child as a mother would on a desert\nisland with one child at her knees.”",
        "“You can get another-one not your own, as this isn’t,” argued Jean\nJacques fiercely.",
        "She was not to be forced to answer his arguments directly.  She chose her\nown course to convince.  “Nolan loves this child as if it was his,” she\ndeclared, her eyes all afire, “but he mightn’t love another–men are\nqueer creatures.  Then where would I be?  and what would the home be but\nwhat it was before–as cold, as cold and bitter!  It was the hand of God\nbrought the child to the door of two people who had no child and who\nprayed for one.  Do you deny it was the hand of God that brought your\ndaughter here away, that put the child in my arms?  Not its mother,\nam I not?  But I love her better than twenty mothers could.  It’s the\nhunger–the hunger–the hunger in me.  She’s made a woman of me.  She has\na home where everything is hers–everything.  To see Nolan play with her,\ntossin’ her up and down in his arms as if he’d done it all his life–as\nnatural as natural!  To take her away from that–all the comfort here\nwhere she can have annything she wants!  With my old mother to care for\nher, if so be I was away to market or whereabouts–one that brought up\nsix children, a millionaire among them, praise be to God as my mother\ndid–to take this delicate little thing away from here, what a sin and\ncrime ’twould be!  She herself ’d never forgive you for it, if ever she\ngrew up–though that’s not likely, things bein’ as they are with you, and\nyou bein’ what you are.  Ah, there–there she is awake and smilin’, and\nkickin’ up her pretty toes this minute!  There she is, the lovely little\nZoe, with eyes like black pearls.  .  .  .  See now–see now which she’ll\ncome to–to you or me, m’sieu’.  There, put out your arms to her, and\nI’ll put out mine, and see which she’ll take.  I’ll stand by that–I’ll\nstand by that.  Let the child decide.  Hold out your arms, and so will I”",
        "With an impassioned word Jean Jacques reached down his arms to the child,\nwhich lay laughing up at them and kicking its pink toes into the air, and\nNorah Doyle did the same, murmuring an Irish love-name for a child.  Jean\nJacques was silent, but in his face was the longing of a soul sick for\nhome, of one who desires the end of a toilsome road.",
        "The laughing child crooned and spluttered and shook its head, as though\nit was playing some happy game.  It looked first at Norah, then at Jean\nJacques, then at Norah again, and then, with a little gurgle of pleasure,\nstretched out its arms to her and half-raised itself from the pillow.\nWith a glad cry Norah gathered it to her bosom, and triumph shone in her\nface.",
        "“Ah, there, you see!” she said, as she lifted her face from the blossom\nat her breast.",
        "“There it is,” said Jean Jacques with shaking voice.",
        "“You have nothing to give her–I have everything,” she urged.  “My rights\nare that I would die for the child–oh, fifty times!  .  .  .  What are\nyou going to do, m’sieu’?”",
        "Jean Jacques slowly turned and picked up his hat.  He moved with the\ndignity of a hero who marches towards a wall to meet the bullets of a\nfiring-squad.",
        "“You are going?” Norah whispered, and in her eyes was a great relief and\nthe light of victory.  The golden link binding Nolan and herself was in\nher arms, over her heart.",
        "Jean Jacques did not speak a word in reply, though his lips moved.  She\nheld out the little one to him for a good-bye, but he shook his head.  If\nhe did that–if he once held her in his arms–he would not be able to\ngive her up.  Gravely and solemnly, however, he stooped over and kissed\nthe lips of the child lying against Norah’s breast.  As he did so, with a\nquick, mothering instinct Norah impulsively kissed his shaggy head, and\nher eyes filled with tears.  She smiled too, and Jean Jacques saw how\nbeautiful her teeth were–cruel no longer.",
        "He moved away slowly.  At the door he turned, and looked back at the two\n–a long, lingering look he gave.  Then he faced away from them again.",
        "“Moi je suis philosophe,” he said gently, and opened the door and stepped\nout and away into the frozen world.",
        "Change might lay its hand on the parish of St. Saviour’s, and it did so\non the beautiful sentient living thing, as on the thing material and man-\nmade; but there was no change in the sheltering friendship of Mont Violet\nor the flow of the illustrious Beau Cheval.  The autumns also changed not\nat all.  They cast their pensive canopies over the home-scene which Jean\nJacques loved so well, before he was exhaled from its bosom.",
        "One autumn when the hillsides were in those colours which none but a\nrainbow of the moon ever had, so delicately sad, so tenderly assuring,\na traveller came back to St. Saviour’s after a long journey.  He came by\nboat to the landing at the Manor Cartier, rather than by train to the\nrailway-station, from which there was a drive of several miles to Vilray.\nAt the landing he was met by a woman, as much a miniature of the days of\nOrleanist France as himself.  She wore lace mits which covered the hands\nbut not the fingers, and her gown showed the outline of a meek crinoline.",
        "“Ah, Fille–ah, dear Fille!” said the little fragment of an antique day,\nas the Clerk of the Court–rather, he that had been for so many years\nClerk of the Court–stepped from the boat.  “I can scarce believe that\nyou are here once more.  Have you good news?”",
        "“It was to come back with good news that I went,” her brother answered\nsmiling, his face lighted by an inner exaltation.",
        "“Dear, dear Fille!”  She always called him that now, and not by his\nChristian name, as though he was a peer.  She had done so ever since the\nGovernment had made him a magistrate, and Laval University had honoured\nhim with the degree of doctor of laws.",
        "She was leading him to the pony-carriage in which she had come to meet\nhim, when he said:",
        "“Do you think you could walk the distance, my dear?  .  .  . It would be\nlike old times,” he added gently.",
        "“I could walk twice as far to-day,” she answered, and at once gave\ndirections for the young coachman to put “His Honour’s” bag into the\ncarriage.  In spite of Fille’s reproofs she insisted in calling him that\nto the servants.  They had two servants now, thanks to the legacy left\nthem by the late Judge Carcasson.  Presently M. Fille took her by the\nhand.  “Before we start–one look yonder,” he murmured, pointing towards\nthe mill which had once belonged to Jean Jacques, now rebuilt and looking\nalmost as of old.  “I promised Jean Jacques that I would come and salute\nit in his name, before I did aught else, and so now I do salute it.”",
        "He waved a hand and made a bow to the gold Cock of Beaugard, the pride of\nall the vanished Barbilles.  “Jean Jacques Barbille says that his head is\nup like yours, M. le Coq, and he wishes you many, many winds to come,” he\nrecited quite seriously, and as though it was not out of tune with the\nmodern world.",
        "The gold Cock of Beaugard seemed to understand, for it swung to the left,\nand now a little to the right, and then stood still, as if looking at the\nlittle pair of exiles from an ancient world–of which the only vestiges\nremaining may be found in old Quebec.",
        "This ceremony over, they walked towards Mont Violet, averting their heads\nas they passed the Manor Cartier, in a kind of tribute to its departed\nmaster–as a Stuart Legitimist might pass the big palace at the end of\nthe Mall in London.  In the wood-path, Fille took his sister’s hand.",
        "“I will tell you what you are so trembling to hear,” he said.  “There\nthey are at peace, Jean Jacques and Virginie–that best of best women.”",
        "“To think–married to Virginie Poucette–to think of that!”  His sister’s\nvoice fluttered as she spoke.  “But entirely.  There was nothing in the\nway–and she meant to have him, the dear soul!  I do not blame her, for\nat bottom he is as good a man as lives.  Our Judge called him ’That dear\nfool, Jean Jacques, a man of men in his way, after all,’ and our Judge\nwas always right–but yes, nearly always right.”",
        "After a moment of contented meditation he resumed.  “Well, when Virginie\nsold her place here and went to live with her sister out at Shilah in the\nWest, she said, ’If Jean Jacques is alive, he will be on the land which\nwas Zoe’s, which he bought for her.  If he is alive–then!’ So it was,\nand by one of the strange accidents which chance or women like Virginie,\nwho have plenty of courage in their simpleness, arrange, they met on that\nthree hundred and sixty acres.  It was like the genius of Jean Jacques to\nhave done that one right thing which would save him in the end–a thing\nwhich came out of his love for his child–the emotion of an hour.\nIndeed, that three hundred and sixty acres was his salvation after he\nlearned of Zoe’s death, and the other little Zoe, his grandchild, was\ndenied to him–to close his heart against what seemed that last hope, was\nit not courage?  And so, and so he has the reward of his own soul–a home\nat last once more.”",
        "“With Virginie Poucette–Fille, Fille, how things come round!” exclaimed\nthe little lady in the tiny bonnet with the mauve strings.",
        "“More than Virginie came round,” he replied almost oracularly.  “Who,\nthink you, brought him the news that coal was found on his acres–who but\nthe husband of Virginie’s sister!  Then came Virginie.  On the day Jean\nJacques saw her again, he said to her, ’What you would have given me at\nsuch cost, now let me pay for with the rest of my life.  It is the great\nthought which was in your heart that I will pay for with the days left to\nme.’”",
        "A flickering smile brightened the sensitive ascetic face, and humour was\nin the eyes.  “What do you think Virginie said to that?  Her sister told\nme.  Virginie said to that, ’You will have more days left, Jean Jacques,\nif you have a better cook.  What do you like best for supper?’  And Jean\nJacques laughed much at that.  Years ago he would have made a speech at\nit!”",
        "“Then he is no more a philosopher?”",
        "“Oh always, always, but in his heart, and not with his tongue.  I cried,\nand so did he, when we met and when we parted.  I think I am getting old,\nfor indeed I could not help it: yet there was peace in his eyes–peace.”",
        "“His eyes used to rustle so.”",
        "“Rustle–that is the word.  Now, that is what, he has learned in life–\nthe way to peace.  When I left him, it was with Virginie close beside\nhim, and when I said to him, ’Will you come back to us one day, Jean\nJacques?’ he said, ’But no, Fille, my friend; it is too far.  I see it–\nit is a million miles away–too great a journey to go with the feet, but\nwith the soul I will visit it.  The soul is a great traveller.  I see it\nalways–the clouds and the burnings and the pitfalls gone–out of sight–\nin memory as it was when I was a child.  Well, there it is, everything\nhas changed, except the child-memory.  I have had, and I have had not;\nand there it is.  I am not the same man–but yes, in my love just the\nsame, with all the rest–’  He did not go on, so I said, ’If not the\nsame, then what are you, Jean Jacques?’”",
        "“Ah, Fille, in the old days he would have said that he was a philosopher\"\n–said his sister interrupting.  “Yes, yes, one knows–he said it often\nenough and had need enough to say it.  Well, said he to me, ’Me, I am a’\n–then he stopped, shook his head, and so I could scarcely hear him,\nmurmured, ’Me–I am a man who has been a long journey with a pack on his\nback, and has got home again.’  Then he took Virginie’s hand in his.”",
        "The old man’s fingers touched the corner of his eye as though to find\nsomething there; then continued.  “’Ah, a pedlar!’ said I to him, to hear\nwhat he would answer.  ’Follies to sell for sous of wisdom,’ he answered.\nThen he put his arm around Virginie, and she gave him his pipe.”",
        "“I wish M. Carcasson knew,” the little grey lady remarked.",
        "“But of course he knows,” said the Clerk of the Court, with his face\nturned to the sunset.",
