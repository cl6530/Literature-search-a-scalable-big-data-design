        "The Queen having been robbed of her purse as she was passing from the\nTuileries to the Feuillans, requested my sister to lend her twenty-five\nlouis.",
        "     [On being interrogated the Queen declared that these five and twenty\n     louis had been lent to her by my sister; this formed a pretence for\n     arresting her and me, and led to her death.–MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "I spent part of the day at the Feuillans, and her Majesty told me she\nwould ask Potion to let me be with her in the place which the Assembly\nshould decree for her prison.  I then returned home to prepare everything\nthat might be necessary for me to accompany her.",
        "On the same day (11th August), at nine in the evening, I returned to the\nFeuillans.  I found there were orders at all the gates forbidding my\nbeing admitted.  I claimed a right to enter by virtue of the first\npermission which had been given to me; I was again refused.  I was told\nthat the Queen had as many people as were requisite about her.  My sister\nwas with her, as well as one of my companions, who came out of the\nprisons of the Abbaye on the 11th.  I renewed my solicitations on the\n12th; my tears and entreaties moved neither the keepers of the gates, nor\neven a deputy, to whom I addressed myself.",
        "I soon heard of the removal of Louis XVI. and his family to the Temple.\nI went to Potion accompanied by M. Valadon, for whom I had procured a\nplace in the post-office, and who was devoted to me.  He determined to go\nup to Potion alone; he told him that those who requested to be confined\ncould not be suspected of evil designs, and that no political opinion\ncould afford a ground of objection to these solicitations.  Seeing that\nthe well-meaning man did not succeed, I thought to do more in person; but\nPetion persisted in his refusal, and threatened to send me to La Force.\nThinking to give me a kind of consolation, he added I might be certain\nthat all those who were then with Louis XVI. and his family would not\nstay with them long.  And in fact, two or three days afterwards the\nPrincesse de Lamballe, Madame de Tourzel, her daughter, the Queen’s first\nwoman, the first woman of the Dauphin and of Madame, M. de Chamilly, and\nM. de Hue were carried off during the night and transferred to La Force.\nAfter the departure of the King and Queen for the Temple, my sister was\ndetained a prisoner in the apartments their Majesties had quitted for\ntwenty-four hours.",
        "From this time I was reduced to the misery of having no further\nintelligence of my august and unfortunate mistress but through the medium\nof the newspapers or the National Guard, who did duty at the Temple.",
        "The King and Queen said nothing to me at the Feuillans about the\nportfolio which had been deposited with me; no doubt they expected to see\nme again.  The minister Roland and the deputies composing the provisional\ngovernment were very intent on a search for papers belonging to their\nMajesties.  They had the whole of the Tuileries ransacked.  The infamous\nRobespierre bethought himself of M. Campan, the Queen’s private\nsecretary, and said that his death was feigned; that he was living\nunknown in some obscure part of France, and was doubtless the depositary\nof all the important papers.  In a great portfolio belonging to the King\nthere had been found a solitary letter from the Comte d’Artois, which, by\nits date, and the subjects of which it treated, indicated the existence\nof a continued correspondence.  (This letter appeared among the documents\nused on the trial of Louis XVI.)  A former preceptor of my son’s had\nstudied with Robespierre; the latter, meeting him in the street, and\nknowing the connection which had subsisted between him and the family of\nM. Campan, required him to say, upon his honour, whether he was certain\nof the death of the latter.  The man replied that M. Campan had died at\nLa Briche in 1791, and that he had seen him interred in the cemetery of\nEpinay.  “well, then,” resumed Robespierre, “bring me the certificate of\nhis burial at twelve to-morrow; it is a document for which I have\npressing occasion.”  Upon hearing the deputy’s demand I instantly sent\nfor a certificate of M. Campan’s burial, and Robespierre received it at\nnine o’clock the next morning.  But I considered that, in thinking of my\nfather-in-law, they were coming very near me, the real depositary of\nthese important papers.  I passed days and nights in considering what I\ncould do for the best under such circumstances.",
        "I was thus situated when the order to inform against those who had been\ndenounced as suspected on the 10th of August led to domiciliary visits.\nMy servants were told that the people of the quarter in which I lived\nwere talking much of the search that would be made in my house, and came\nto apprise me of it.  I heard that fifty armed men would make themselves\nmasters of M. Auguies house, where I then was.  I had just received this\nintelligence when M. Gougenot, the King’s maitre d’hotel and receiver-\ngeneral of the taxes, a man much attached to his sovereign, came into my\nroom wrapped in a ridingcloak, under which, with great difficulty, he\ncarried the King’s portfolio, which I had entrusted to him.  He threw it\ndown at my feet, and said to me, “There is your deposit; I did not\nreceive it from our unfortunate King’s own hands; in delivering it to you\nI have executed my trust.”  After saying this he was about to withdraw.\nI stopped him, praying him to consult with me what I ought to do in such\na trying emergency.  He would not listen to my entreaties, or even hear\nme describe the course I intended to pursue.  I told him my abode was\nabout to be surrounded; I imparted to him what the Queen had said to me\nabout the contents of the portfolio.  To all this he answered, “There it\nis; decide for yourself; I will have no hand in it.”  Upon that I\nremained a few seconds thinking, and my conduct was founded upon the\nfollowing reasons.  I spoke aloud, although to myself; I walked about the\nroom with agitated steps; M. Gougenot was thunderstruck.  “Yes,” said I,\n“when we can no longer communicate with our King and receive his orders,\nhowever attached we may be to him, we can only serve him according to the\nbest of our own judgment.  The Queen said to me, ’This portfolio contains\nscarcely anything but documents of a most dangerous description in the\nevent of a trial taking place, if it should fall into the hands of\nrevolutionary persons.’  She mentioned, too, a single document which\nwould, under the same circumstances, be useful.  It is my duty to\ninterpret her words, and consider them as orders.  She meant to say,\n’You will save such a paper, you will destroy the rest if they are likely\nto be taken from you.’  If it were not so, was there any occasion for her\nto enter into any detail as to what the portfolio contained?  The order\nto keep it was sufficient.  Probably it contains, moreover, the letters\nof that part of the family which has emigrated; there is nothing which\nmay have been foreseen or decided upon that can be useful now; and there\ncan be no political thread which has not been cut by the events of the\n10th of August and the imprisonment of the King.  My house is about to be\nsurrounded; I cannot conceal anything of such bulk; I might, then,\nthrough want of foresight, give up that which would cause the\ncondemnation of the King.  Let us open the portfolio, save the document\nalluded to, and destroy the rest.”  I took a knife and cut open one side\nof the portfolio.  I saw a great number of envelopes endorsed by the\nKing’s own hand.  M. Gougenot found there the former seals of the King,",
        "     [No doubt it was in order to have the ancient seals ready at a\n     moment’s notice, in case of a counter-revolution, that the Queen\n     desired me not to quit the Tuileries.  M. Gougenot threw the seals\n     into the river, one from above the Pont Neuf, and the other from\n     near the Pont Royal.–MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "such as they were before the Assembly had changed the inscription.  At\nthis moment we heard a great noise; he agreed to tie up the portfolio,\ntake it again under his cloak, and go to a safe place to execute what I\nhad taken upon me to determine.  He made me swear, by all I held most\nsacred, that I would affirm, under every possible emergency, that the\ncourse I was pursuing had not been dictated to me by anybody; and that,\nwhatever might be the result, I would take all the credit or all the\nblame upon myself.  I lifted up my hand and took the oath he required;\nhe went out.  Half an hour afterwards a great number of armed men came to\nmy house; they placed sentinels at all the outlets; they broke open\nsecretaires and closets of which they had not the keys; they ’searched\nthe flower-pots and boxes; they examined the cellars; and the commandant\nrepeatedly said, “Look particularly for papers.”  In the afternoon M.\nGougenot returned.  He had still the seals of France about him, and he\nbrought me a statement of all that he had burnt.",
        "The portfolio contained twenty letters from Monsieur, eighteen or\nnineteen from the Comte d’Artois, seventeen from Madame Adelaide,\neighteen from Madame Victoire, a great many letters from Comte Alexandre\nde Lameth, and many from M. de Malesherbes, with documents annexed to\nthem.  There were also some from M. de Montmorin and other ex-ministers\nor ambassadors.  Each correspondence had its title written in the King’s\nown hand upon the blank paper which contained it.  The most voluminous\nwas that from Mirabeau.  It was tied up with a scheme for an escape,\nwhich he thought necessary.  M. Gougenot, who had skimmed over these\nletters with more attention than the rest, told me they were of so\ninteresting a nature that the King had no doubt kept them as documents\nexceedingly valuable for a history of his reign, and that the\ncorrespondence with the Princes, which was entirely relative to what was\ngoing forward abroad, in concert with the King, would have been fatal to\nhim if it had been seized.  After he had finished he placed in my hands\nthe proces-verbal, signed by all the ministers, to which the King\nattached so much importance, because he had given his opinion against the\ndeclaration of war; a copy of the letter written by the King to the\nPrinces, his brothers, inviting them to return to France; an account of\nthe diamonds which the Queen had sent to Brussels (these two documents\nwere in my handwriting); and a receipt for four hundred thousand francs,\nunder the hand of a celebrated banker.  This sum was part of the eight\nhundred thousand francs which the Queen had gradually saved during her\nreign, out of her pension of three hundred thousand francs per annum, and\nout of the one hundred thousand francs given by way of present on the\nbirth of the Dauphin.",
        "This receipt, written on a very small piece of paper, was in the cover of\nan almanac.  I agreed with M. Gougenot, who was obliged by his office to\nreside in Paris, that he should retain the proces-verbal of the Council\nand the receipt for the four hundred thousand francs, and that we should\nwait either for orders or for the means of transmitting these documents\nto the King or Queen; and I set out for Versailles.",
        "The strictness of the precautions taken to guard the illustrious\nprisoners was daily increased.  The idea that I could not inform the King\nof the course I had adopted of burning his papers, and the fear that I\nshould not be able to transmit to him that which he had pointed out as\nnecessary, tormented me to such a degree that it is wonderful my health\nendured the strain.",
        "The dreadful trial drew near.  Official advocates were granted to the\nKing; the heroic virtue of M. de Malesherbes induced him to brave the\nmost imminent dangers, either to save his master or to perish with him.\nI hoped also to be able to find some means of informing his Majesty of\nwhat I had thought it right to do.  I sent a man, on whom I could rely,\nto Paris, to request M. Gougenot to come to me at Versailles he came\nimmediately.  We agreed that he should see M. de Malesherbes without\navailing himself of any intermediate person for that purpose.",
        "M. Gougenot awaited his return from the Temple at the door of his hotel,\nand made a sign that he wished to speak to him.  A moment afterwards a\nservant came to introduce him into the magistrates’ room.  He imparted to\nM. de Malesherbes what I had thought it right to do with respect to the\nKing’s papers, and placed in his hands the proces-verbal of the Council,\nwhich his Majesty had preserved in order to serve, if occasion required\nit, for a ground of his defence.  However, that paper is not mentioned in\neither of the speeches of his advocate; probably it was determined not to\nmake use of it.",
        "I stop at that terrible period which is marked by the assassination of a\nKing whose virtues are well known; but I cannot refrain from relating\nwhat he deigned to say in my favour to M. de Malesherbes:",
        "“Let Madame Campan know that she did what I should myself have ordered\nher to do; I thank her for it; she is one of those whom I regret I have\nit not in my power to recompense for their fidelity to my person, and for\ntheir good services.”  I did not hear of this until the morning after he\nhad suffered, and I think I should have sunk under my despair if this\nhonourable testimony had not given me some consolation.",
