        "The Devil’s Dictionary was begun in a weekly paper in 1881, and was \ncontinued in a desultory way at long intervals until 1906.  In that \nyear a large part of it was published in covers with the title The \nCynic’s Word Book, a name which the author had not the power to \nreject or happiness to approve.  To quote the publishers of the \npresent work:",
        "“This more reverent title had previously been forced upon him by \nthe religious scruples of the last newspaper in which a part of the \nwork had appeared, with the natural consequence that when it came out \nin covers the country already had been flooded by its imitators with a \nscore of ’cynic’ books — The Cynic’s This, The Cynic’s That, and \nThe Cynic’s t’Other.  Most of these books were merely stupid, though \nsome of them added the distinction of silliness.  Among them, they \nbrought the word ’cynic’ into disfavor so deep that any book bearing \nit was discredited in advance of publication.”",
        "Meantime, too, some of the enterprising humorists of the country \nhad helped themselves to such parts of the work as served their needs, \nand many of its definitions, anecdotes, phrases and so forth, had \nbecome more or less current in popular speech.  This explanation is \nmade, not with any pride of priority in trifles, but in simple denial \nof possible charges of plagiarism, which is no trifle.  In merely \nresuming his own the author hopes to be held guiltless by those to \nwhom the work is addressed — enlightened souls who prefer dry wines \nto sweet, sense to sentiment, wit to humor and clean English to slang.",
        "A conspicuous, and it is hope not unpleasant, feature of the book \nis its abundant illustrative quotations from eminent poets, chief of \nwhom is that learned and ingenius cleric, Father Gassalasca Jape, \nS.J., whose lines bear his initials.  To Father Jape’s kindly \nencouragement and assistance the author of the prose text is greatly \nindebted.",

        "  Poor Isabella’s Dead, whose abdication\n  Set all tongues wagging in the Spanish nation.\n  For that performance ’twere unfair to scold her:\n  She wisely left a throne too hot to hold her.\n  To History she’ll be no royal riddle —\n  Merely a plain parched pea that jumped the griddle.",
        "G.J.",
        "\nABDOMEN, n.  The temple of the god Stomach, in whose worship, with \nsacrificial rights, all true men engage.  From women this ancient \nfaith commands but a stammering assent.  They sometimes minister at \nthe altar in a half-hearted and ineffective way, but true reverence \nfor the one deity that men really adore they know not.  If woman had a \nfree hand in the world’s marketing the race would become \ngraminivorous.",
        "ABILITY, n.  The natural equipment to accomplish some small part of \nthe meaner ambitions distinguishing able men from dead ones.  In the \nlast analysis ability is commonly found to consist mainly in a high \ndegree of solemnity.  Perhaps, however, this impressive quality is \nrightly appraised; it is no easy task to be solemn.",
        "ABNORMAL, adj.  Not conforming to standard.  In matters of thought and \nconduct, to be independent is to be abnormal, to be abnormal is to be \ndetested.  Wherefore the lexicographer adviseth a striving toward the \nstraiter [sic] resemblance of the Average Man than he hath to himself.  \nWhoso attaineth thereto shall have peace, the prospect of death and \nthe hope of Hell.",

        "  Whether the word is a verb or a noun\n      Is knowledge beyond my reach.\n  I only know that ’tis handed down.\n          From sage to sage,\n          From age to age —\n      An immortal part of speech!",
        "  Of an ancient man the tale is told\n  That he lived to be ten centuries old,\n      In a cave on a mountain side.\n      (True, he finally died.)\n  The fame of his wisdom filled the land,\n  For his head was bald, and you’ll understand\n      His beard was long and white\n      And his eyes uncommonly bright.",
        "  Philosophers gathered from far and near\n  To sit at his feat and hear and hear,\n          Though he never was heard\n          To utter a word\n      But “Abracadabra, abracadab,\n          Abracada, abracad,\n      Abraca, abrac, abra, ab!“\n          ’Twas all he had,\n  ’Twas all they wanted to hear, and each\n  Made copious notes of the mystical speech,\n          Which they published next —\n          A trickle of text\n  In the meadow of commentary.\n      Mighty big books were these,\n      In a number, as leaves of trees;\n  In learning, remarkably — very!",
        "          He’s dead,\n          As I said,\n  And the books of the sages have perished,\n  But his wisdom is sacredly cherished.\n  In Abracadabra it solemnly rings,\n  Like an ancient bell that forever swings.\n          O, I love to hear\n          That word make clear\n  Humanity’s General Sense of Things.",

Not many absolute monarchies are left, most of them \nhaving been replaced by limited monarchies, where the sovereign’s \npower for evil (and for good) is greatly curtailed, and by republics, \nwhich are governed by chance.",
        "ABSTAINER, n.  A weak person who yields to the temptation of denying \nhimself a pleasure.  A total abstainer is one who abstains from \neverything but abstention, and especially from inactivity in the \naffairs of others.",

The animal is widely and variously \ncelebrated in the literature, art and religion of every age and \ncountry; no other so engages and fires the human imagination as this \nnoble vertebrate.  Indeed, it is doubted by some (Ramasilus, lib. \nII., De Clem., and C. Stantatus, De Temperamente) if it is not a \ngod; and as such we know it was worshiped by the Etruscans, and, if we \nmay believe Macrobious, by the Cupasians also.  Of the only two \nanimals admitted into the Mahometan Paradise along with the souls of \nmen, the ass that carried Balaam is one, the dog of the Seven Sleepers \nthe other.  This is no small distinction.  From what has been written \nabout this beast might be compiled a library of great splendor and \nmagnitude, rivalling that of the Shakespearean cult, and that which \nclusters about the Bible.

        "FLY-SPECK, n.  The prototype of punctuation.  It is observed by \nGarvinus that the systems of punctuation in use by the various \nliterary nations depended originally upon the social habits and \ngeneral diet of the flies infesting the several countries.  These \ncreatures, which have always been distinguished for a neighborly and \ncompanionable familiarity with authors, liberally or niggardly \nembellish the manuscripts in process of growth under the pen, \naccording to their bodily habit, bringing out the sense of the work by \na species of interpretation superior to, and independent of, the \nwriter’s powers.  The “old masters” of literature — that is to say, \nthe early writers whose work is so esteemed by later scribes and \ncritics in the same language — never punctuated at all, but worked \nright along free-handed, without that abruption of the thought which \ncomes from the use of points.  (We observe the same thing in children \nto-day, whose usage in this particular is a striking and beautiful \ninstance of the law that the infancy of individuals reproduces the \nmethods and stages of development characterizing the infancy of \nraces.)  In the work of these primitive scribes all the punctuation is \nfound, by the modern investigator with his optical instruments and \nchemical tests, to have been inserted by the writers’ ingenious and \nserviceable collaborator, the common house-fly — Musca maledicta.  \nIn transcribing these ancient MSS, for the purpose of either making \nthe work their own or preserving what they naturally regard as divine \nrevelations, later writers reverently and accurately copy whatever \nmarks they find upon the papyrus or parchment, to the unspeakable \nenhancement of the lucidity of the thought and value of the work.  \nWriters contemporary with the copyists naturally avail themselves of \nthe obvious advantages of these marks in their own work, and with such \nassistance as the flies of their own household may be willing to \ngrant, frequently rival and sometimes surpass the older compositions, \nin respect at least of punctuation, which is no small glory.  Fully to \nunderstand the important services that flies perform to literature it \nis only necessary to lay a page of some popular novelist alongside a \nsaucer of cream-and-molasses in a sunny room and observe “how the wit \nbrightens and the style refines” in accurate proportion to the \nduration of exposure.",

Skeptical persons have doubted Homer’s authorship of the \nwork, but the learned, ingenious and industrious Dr. Schliemann has \nset the question forever at rest by uncovering the bones of the slain \nfrogs.  One of the forms of moral suasion by which Pharaoh was \nbesought to favor the Israelities was a plague of frogs, but Pharaoh, \nwho liked them fricasees, remarked, with truly oriental stoicism, \nthat he could stand it as long as the frogs and the Jews could; so the \nprogramme was changed.  The frog is a diligent songster, having a good \nvoice but no ear.  The libretto of his favorite opera, as written by \nAristophanes, is brief, simple and effective — “brekekex-koax\"; the \nmusic is apparently by that eminent composer, Richard Wagner.

Many believe that the bear hibernates during the \nwhole winter and subsists by mechanically sucking its paws.  It is \nadmitted that it comes out of its retirement in the spring so lean \nthat it had to try twice before it can cast a shadow.

Liability to attacks of laughter \nis one of the characteristics distinguishing man from the animals — \nthese being not only inaccessible to the provocation of his example, \nbut impregnable to the microbes having original jurisdiction in \nbestowal of the disease.  Whether laughter could be imparted to \nanimals by inoculation from the human patient is a question that has \nnot been answered by experimentation.  Dr. Meir Witchell holds that \nthe infection character of laughter is due to the instantaneous \nfermentation of sputa diffused in a spray.

        "\nOPPOSITION, n.  In politics the party that prevents the Government from \nrunning amuck by hamstringing it.\n  The King of Ghargaroo, who had been abroad to study the science of \ngovernment, appointed one hundred of his fattest subjects as members \nof a parliament to make laws for the collection of revenue.  Forty of \nthese he named the Party of Opposition and had his Prime Minister \ncarefully instruct them in their duty of opposing every royal measure.  \nNevertheless, the first one that was submitted passed unanimously.  \nGreatly displeased, the King vetoed it, informing the Opposition that \nif they did that again they would pay for their obstinacy with their \nheads.  The entire forty promptly disemboweled themselves.\n  “What shall we do now?” the King asked.  “Liberal institutions \ncannot be maintained without a party of Opposition.\"\n  “Splendor of the universe,” replied the Prime Minister, “it is \ntrue these dogs of darkness have no longer their credentials, but all \nis not lost.  Leave the matter to this worm of the dust.\"\n  So the Minister had the bodies of his Majesty’s Opposition \nembalmed and stuffed with straw, put back into the seats of power and \nnailed there.  Forty votes were recorded against every bill and the \nnation prospered.  But one day a bill imposing a tax on warts was \ndefeated — the members of the Government party had not been nailed to \ntheir seats!  This so enraged the King that the Prime Minister was put \nto death, the parliament was dissolved with a battery of artillery, \nand government of the people, by the people, for the people perished \nfrom Ghargaroo.",

Sealing, \nin this sense, is a survival of an ancient custom of inscribing \nimportant papers with cabalistic words or signs to give them a magical \nefficacy independent of the authority that they represent.  In the \nBritish museum are preserved many ancient papers, mostly of a \nsacerdotal character, validated by necromantic pentagrams and other \ndevices, frequently initial letters of words to conjure with; and in \nmany instances these are attached in the same way that seals are \nappended now.  As nearly every reasonless and apparently meaningless \ncustom, rite or observance of modern times had origin in some remote \nutility, it is pleasing to note an example of ancient nonsense \nevolving in the process of ages into something really useful.  Our \nword “sincere” is derived from sine cero, without wax, but the \nlearned are not in agreement as to whether this refers to the absence \nof the cabalistic signs, or to that of the wax with which letters were \nformerly closed from public scrutiny.  Either view of the matter will \nserve one in immediate need of an hypothesis.

        "SOUL, n.  A spiritual entity concerning which there hath been brave \ndisputation.  Plato held that those souls which in a previous state of \nexistence (antedating Athens) had obtained the clearest glimpses of \neternal truth entered into the bodies of persons who became \nphilosophers.  Plato himself was a philosopher.  The souls that had \nleast contemplated divine truth animated the bodies of usurpers and \ndespots.  Dionysius I, who had threatened to decapitate the broad- \nbrowed philosopher, was a usurper and a despot.  Plato, doubtless, was \nnot the first to construct a system of philosophy that could be quoted \nagainst his enemies; certainly he was not the last.\n  “Concerning the nature of the soul,” saith the renowned author of \nDiversiones Sanctorum, “there hath been hardly more argument than \nthat of its place in the body.  Mine own belief is that the soul hath \nher seat in the abdomen — in which faith we may discern and interpret \na truth hitherto unintelligible, namely that the glutton is of all men \nmost devout.  He is said in the Scripture to ’make a god of his belly’ \n— why, then, should he not be pious, having ever his Deity with him \nto freshen his faith?  Who so well as he can know the might and \nmajesty that he shrines?  Truly and soberly, the soul and the stomach \nare one Divine Entity; and such was the belief of Promasius, who \nnevertheless erred in denying it immortality.  He had observed that \nits visible and material substance failed and decayed with the rest of \nthe body after death, but of its immaterial essence he knew nothing.  \nThis is what we call the Appetite, and it survives the wreck and reek \nof mortality, to be rewarded or punished in another world, according \nto what it hath demanded in the flesh.  The Appetite whose coarse \nclamoring was for the unwholesome viands of the general market and the \npublic refectory shall be cast into eternal famine, whilst that which \nfirmly through civilly insisted on ortolans, caviare, terrapin, \nanchovies, pates de foie gras and all such Christian comestibles \nshall flesh its spiritual tooth in the souls of them forever and ever, \nand wreak its divine thirst upon the immortal parts of the rarest and \nrichest wines ever quaffed here below.

In order to \neffect this purpose it is necessary to supply a contrast in the person \nof one who is called the defendant, the prisoner, or the accused.  If \nthe contrast is made sufficiently clear this person is made to undergo \nsuch an affliction as will give the virtuous gentlemen a comfortable \nsense of their immunity, added to that of their worth.  In our day the \naccused is usually a human being, or a socialist, but in mediaeval \ntimes, animals, fishes, reptiles and insects were brought to trial.  A \nbeast that had taken human life, or practiced sorcery, was duly \narrested, tried and, if condemned, put to death by the public \nexecutioner.  Insects ravaging grain fields, orchards or vineyards \nwere cited to appeal by counsel before a civil tribunal, and after \ntestimony, argument and condemnation, if they continued in \ncontumaciam the matter was taken to a high ecclesiastical court, \nwhere they were solemnly excommunicated and anathematized.  In a \nstreet of Toledo, some pigs that had wickedly run between the \nviceroy’s legs, upsetting him, were arrested on a warrant, tried and \npunished.  In Naples and ass was condemned to be burned at the stake, \nbut the sentence appears not to have been executed.  D’Addosio relates \nfrom the court records many trials of pigs, bulls, horses, cocks, \ndogs, goats, etc., greatly, it is believed, to the betterment of their \nconduct and morals.  In 1451 a suit was brought against the leeches \ninfesting some ponds about Berne, and the Bishop of Lausanne, \ninstructed by the faculty of Heidelberg University, directed that some \nof “the aquatic worms” be brought before the local magistracy.  This \nwas done and the leeches, both present and absent, were ordered to \nleave the places that they had infested within three days on pain of \nincurring “the malediction of God.”  In the voluminous records of this \ncause celebre nothing is found to show whether the offenders braved \nthe punishment, or departed forthwith out of that inhospitable \njurisdiction.",

The Greeks \nbefore Troy were so harried by Apollo that they jumped out of the \nfrying-pan of the wrath of Cryses into the fire of the wrath of \nAchilles, though Agamemnon, the sole offender, was neither fried nor \nroasted.
