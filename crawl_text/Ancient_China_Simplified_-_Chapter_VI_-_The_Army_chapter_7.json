        "As the struggle for pre-eminency which we are about to describe\ninvolved bloodthirsty combats extending almost uninterruptedly\nover five centuries, it may be of interest to inquire of what\nconsisted the paraphernalia of warfare in those days. It appears\nthat among the Chinese federal princes, who, as we have seen, only\noccupied in the main the flat country on the right bank of the\nYellow River, war-chariots were invariably used, which is the more\nremarkable in that after the Conquest in 220 B.C. of China by the\nFirst August Emperor of Ts’in, and down to this day, war-chariots\nhave scarcely ever once been even named, at least as having been\nmarshalled in serious battle array. The Emperor alone was supposed\nin true feudal times to possess a force of 10,000 chariots, and\neven now a “10,000-chariot” state is the diplomatic expression\nfor “a great power,” “a power of the first rank,” or “an empire.\"\nNo vassal was entitled to more than 1000 war-chariots. In the\nyear 632 B.C., when Tsin inflicted a great defeat upon its chief\nrival Ts’u, the former power had 700 chariots in the field. In 589\nB.C. the same country, with 800 chariots included in its forces,\nmarched across the Yellow River and defeated the state of Ts’i,\nits rival to the east. Again in 632 Tsin offered to the Emperor\n100 chariots just captured from Ts’u, and in 613 sent 800 chariots\nto the assistance of a dethroned Emperor. The best were made of\nleather, and we may assume from this that the wooden ones found it\nvery difficult to get safely over rough ground, for in a\ncelebrated treaty of peace of 589 B.C. between the two rival\nstates Tsin and Ts’i, the victor, lying to the west, imposed a\ncondition that “your ploughed furrows shall in future run east and\nwest instead of north and south,” meaning that “no systematic\nobstacles shall in future be placed in the way of our invading\nchariots.”",
        "One of the features in many of the vassal states was the growth of\ngreat families, whose private power was very apt to constrain the\nwishes of the reigning duke, count, or baron. Thus in the year\n537, when the King of Ts’u was meditating a treacherous attack\nupon Tsin, he was warned that “there were many magnates at the\nbehest of the ruler of Tsin, each of whom was equal to placing 100\nwar-chariots in the field.” So much a matter of course was it to\nuse chariots in war, that in the year 572, when the rival great\npowers of Ts’u and Tsin were contesting for suzerainty over one of\nthe purely Chinese principalities in the modern Ho Nan province,\nit was considered quite a remarkable fact that this principality\nin taking the side of Ts’u brought no chariots with the forces led\nagainst Tsin. In 541 a refugee prince of Ts’u, seeking asylum in\nTsin, only brought five chariots with him, on which the ruler,\nashamed as host of such a poor display, at once assigned him\nrevenue sufficient for the maintenance of 100 individuals. It so\nhappened that at the same time there arrived in Tsin a refugee\nprince from Ts’in, bringing with him 1000 carts, all heavily\nladen. On another occasion the prince (not a ruler) of a\nneighbouring state, on visiting the ruler of another, brings with\nhim as presents an eight-horsed chariot for the reigning prince, a\nsix-horsed conveyance for the premier, a four-horsed carriage for\na very distinguished minister in the suite, and a two-horsed cart\nfor a minor member of the mission.",
        "Besides the heavy war-chariots, there were also rather more\ncomfortable and lighter conveyances: in one case two generals are\nspoken of ironically because they went to the front playing the\nbanjo in a light cart, whilst their colleague from another state–\nthe very state they were assisting–was roughing it in a war-\nchariot. These latter seem to have connoted, for military\norganization purposes, a strength of 75 men each, and four horses;\nto wit, three heavily armed men or cuirassiers in the chariot\nitself, and 72 foot-soldiers. At least in the case of Tsin, a\nforce of 37,500 men, which in the year 613 boldly marched off\nthree hundred or more English miles upon an eastern expedition, is\nso described. On the other hand, thirty years later, a small Ts’u\nforce is said to have had 125 men attached to each chariot, while\nthe Emperor’s chariots are stated to have had 100 men assigned to\neach. In the year 627 a celebrated battle was fought between the\nrival powers of Ts’in and Tsin, in which the former was utterly\nrouted; “not a man nor a wheel of the whole army ever got back.\"\nWar-chariots are mentioned as having been in use at least as far\nback as 1797 B.C. by the Tartar-affected ancestors of the Chou\ndynasty, nearly 700 years before they themselves came to the\nimperial power. The territory north of the River Wei, inhabited by\nthem, is all yellow loess, deeply furrowed by the stream in\nquestion, and by its tributaries: there is no apparent reason to\nsuppose that the gigantic cart-houses used by the Tartars, even to\nthis day, had any historical connection with the swift war-\nchariots of the Chinese.",
        "Little, if anything, is said of conveying troops by boat in any of\nthe above-mentioned countries north of the Yang-tsz River. None\nof the rivers in Shen Si are navigable, even now, for any\nconsiderable stretches, and the Yellow River itself has its strict\nlimitations. Later on, when the King of Ts’u’s possessions along\nthe sea coast, embracing the delta of the Yang-tsz, revolted from\nhis suzerainty and began (as we shall relate in due course) to\ntake an active part in orthodox Chinese affairs, boats and\ngigantic canal works were introduced by the hitherto totally\nunknown or totally forgotten coast powers; and it is probably\nowing to this innovation that war-chariots suddenly disappeared\nfrom use, and that even in the north of China boat expeditions\nbecame the rule, as indeed was certainly the case after the third\ncentury B.C.",
        "Some idea of the limited population of very ancient China may be\ngained from a consideration of the oldest army computations. The\nEmperor was supposed to have six brigades, the larger vassals\nthree, the lesser two, and the small ones one; but owing to the\nloose way in which a Shi, or regiment of 2,500 men, and a\nKun, or brigade of 12,500 men, are alternately spoken of,\nthe Chinese commentators themselves are rather at a loss to\nestimate how matters really stood after the collapse of the\nEmperor in 771: but though at much later dates enormous armies,\ncounting up to half a million men on each side, stubbornly\ncontended for mastery, at the period of which we speak there is no\nreason to believe that any state, least of all the imperial\nreserve, ever put more than 1000 chariots, or say, 75,000 men,\ninto the field on any one expedition.",
        "Flags seem to have been in use very much as in the West. The\nfounder of the Chou dynasty marched to the conquest of China\ncarrying, or having carried for him, a yellow axe in the left, and\na white flag in the right hand. In 660 one of the minor federal\nprinces was crushed because he did not lower his standard in time;\nnearly a century later, this precedent was quoted to another\nfederal prince when hard-pressed, in consequence of which a sub-\nofficer “rolled up his master’s standard and put it in its\nsheath.” In 645 “the cavaliers under the ruler’s flag “–defined\nto mean his body-guard–were surrounded by the enemy.",
        "During the fifth century B.C., when the coast provinces, having\nseparated from the Ts’u suzerainty, were asserting their equality\nwith the orthodox Chinese princes, and two rival “barbarian\"\narmies were contending for the Shanghai region, one royal scion\nwas indignant when he saw the enemy advance “with the flag\ncaptured in the last battle from his own father the general.\"\nFlags were used, not only to signal movements of troops during the\ncourse of battle, but also in the great hunts or battues which\nwere arranged in peace times, not merely for sport, but also in\norder to prepare soldiers for a military life.",
        "For victories over the Tartars in 623, the Emperor presented the\nruler of Ts’in with a metal drum; and it seems that sacrificing to\nthe regimental drum before a fight was a very ancient custom,\nwhich has been carried down to the present day. In 1900, during\nthe “Boxer” troubles, General (now Viceroy) Yiian Shi-k’ai is\nreported to have sacrificed several condemned criminals to his\ndrum before setting out upon his march.",
