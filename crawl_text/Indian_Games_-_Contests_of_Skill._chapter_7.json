        "Lewis and Clarke [Footnote: Vol. II, p. 140.] describe a game among the\nOregon Indians which can neither be called an athletic game nor a game\nof chance, but which seems to have been a simple contest of skill. “Two\npins are placed on the floor, about the distance of a foot from each\nother, and a small hole made behind them. The players then go about ten\nfeet from the hole, into which they try to roll a small piece,\nresembling the men used at draughts; if they succeed in putting it into\nthe hole, they win the stake; if the piece rolls between the pins, but\ndoes not go into the hole, nothing is won or lost; but the wager is\nwholly lost if the chequer rolls outside the pins.”",
        "Morgan [Footnote: League of the Iroquois, p. 303.] describes a winter\ncontest of skill among the Iroquois, which he calls snow-snake. The\nso-called snakes were made of hickory. They were from five to seven feet\nin length, a quarter of an inch in thickness, tapering from an inch in\nwidth at the head to about half an inch at the tail. The head was round,\nturned up slightly and weighted with lead. This implement was shot along\nthe snow crust, by hand, with great speed, and a point in the game was\ngained by the snake which ran the greatest distance. When there were a\nnumber of players divided into sides, if there were two, three or more\nsnakes of the same side which were in advance of the snakes of the other\nside, all such counted. Such contests usually took place between tribes\nand aroused a great degree of spirit and the usual amount of betting. In\nsimpler form, Sagard Theodat describes this kind of amusement.",
