        "And as for His inner life, what can be said of that? He lay now back in\nhis wooden chair, thinking with closed eyes.",
        "He could not have described it consistently even to Himself, for indeed\nHe scarcely knew it: He acted rather than indulged in reflex thought.\nBut the centre of His position was simple faith. The Catholic Religion,\nHe knew well enough, gave the only adequate explanation of the universe;\nit did not unlock all mysteries, but it unlocked more than any other key\nknown to man; He knew, too, perfectly well, that it was the only system\nof thought that satisfied man as a whole, and accounted for him in his\nessential nature. Further, He saw well enough that the failure of\nChristianity to unite all men one to another rested not upon its\nfeebleness but its strength; its lines met in eternity, not in time.\nBesides, He happened to believe it.",
        "But to this foreground there were other moods whose shifting was out of\nhis control. In his exalt moods, which came upon Him like a breeze\nfrom Paradise, the background was bright with hope and drama–He saw\nHimself and His companions as Peter and the Apostles must have regarded\nthemselves, as they proclaimed through the world, in temples, slums,\nmarket-places and private houses, the faith that was to shake and\ntransform the world. They had handled the Lord of Life, seen the empty\nsepulchre, grasped the pierced hands of Him Who was their brother and\ntheir God. It was radiantly true, though not a man believed it; the huge\nsuperincumbent weight of incredulity could not disturb a fact that was\nas the sun in heaven. Moreover, the very desperateness of the cause was\ntheir inspiration. There was no temptation to lean upon the arm of\nflesh, for there was none that fought for them but God. Their nakedness\nwas their armour, their slow tongues their persuasiveness, their\nweakness demanded God’s strength, and found it. Yet there was this\ndifference, and it was a significant one. For Peter the spiritual world\nhad an interpretation and a guarantee in the outward events he had\nwitnessed. He had handled the Risen Christ, the external corroborated\nthe internal. But for Silvester it was not so. For Him it was necessary\nso to grasp spiritual truths in the supernatural sphere that the\nexternal events of the Incarnation were proved by rather than proved the\ncertitude of His spiritual apprehension. Certainly, historically\nspeaking, Christianity was true–proved by its records–yet to see that\nneeded illumination. He apprehended the power of the Resurrection,\ntherefore Christ was risen.",
        "Therefore in heavier moods it was different with him. There were\nperiods, lasting sometimes for days together, clouding Him when He\nawoke, stifling Him as He tried to sleep, dulling the very savour of the\nSacrament and the thrill of the Precious Blood; times in which the\ndarkness was so intolerable that even the solid objects of faith\nattenuated themselves to shadow, when half His nature was blind not only\nto Christ, but to God Himself, and the reality of His own\nexistence–when His own awful dignity seemed as the insignia of a fool.\nAnd was it conceivable, His earthly mind demanded, that He and His\ncollege of twelve and His few thousands should be right, and the entire\nconsensus of the civilised world wrong? It was not that the world had\nnot heard the message of the Gospel; it had heard little else for two\nthousand years, and now pronounced it false–false in its external\ncredentials, and false therefore in its spiritual claims. It was a lost\ncause for which He suffered; He was not the last of an august line, He\nwas the smoking wick of a candle of folly; He was the reductio ad\nabsurdam of a ludicrous syllogism based on impossible premises. He was\nnot worth killing, He and His company of the insane–they were no more\nthan the crowned dunces of the world’s school. Sanity sat on the solid\nbenches of materialism. And this heaviness waxed so dark sometimes that\nHe almost persuaded Himself that His faith was gone; the clamours of\nmind so loud that the whisper of the heart was unheard, the desires for\nearthly peace so fierce that supernatural ambitions were silenced–so\ndense was the gloom, that, hoping against hope, believing against\nknowledge, and loving against truth, He cried as One other had cried on\nanother day like this–Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani! ... But that, at\nleast, He never failed to cry.",
        "One thing alone gave Him power to go on, so far at least as His\nconsciousness was concerned, and that was His meditation. He had\ntravelled far in the mystical life since His agonies of effort. Now He\nused no deliberate descents into the spiritual world: He threw, as it\nwere, His hands over His head, and dropped into spacelessness.\nConsciousness would draw Him up, as a cork, to the surface, but He would\ndo no more than repeat His action, until by that cessation of activity,\nwhich is the supreme energy, He floated in the twilight realm of\ntranscendence; and there God would deal with Him–now by an articulate\nsentence, now by a sword of pain, now by an air like the vivifying\nbreath of the sea. Sometimes after Communion He would treat Him so,\nsometimes as He fell asleep, sometimes in the whirl of work. Yet His\nconsciousness did not seem to retain for long such experiences; five\nminutes later, it might be, He would be wrestling once more with the all\nbut sensible phantoms of the mind and the heart.",
        "There He lay, then, in the chair, revolving the intolerable blasphemies\nthat He had read. His white hair was thin upon His browned temples, His\nhands were as the hands of a spirit, and His young face lined and\npatched with sorrow. His bare feet protruded from beneath His stained\ntunic, and His old brown burnous lay on the floor beside Him....",
        "It was an hour before He moved, and the sun had already lost half its\nfierceness, when the steps of the horses sounded in the paved court\noutside. Then He sat up, slipped His feet into their shoes, and lifted\nthe burnous from the floor, as the door opened and the lean sun-burned\npriest came through.",
        "“The horses, Holiness,” said the man.",
        "The Pope spoke not one word that afternoon, until the two came towards\nsunset up the bridle-path that leads between Thabor and Nazareth. They\nhad taken their usual round through Cana, mounting a hillock from which\nthe long mirror of Gennesareth could be seen, and passing on, always\nbearing to the right, under the shadow of Thabor until once more\nEsdraelon spread itself beneath like a grey-green carpet, a vast circle,\ntwenty miles across, sprinkled sparsely with groups of huts, white walls\nand roofs, with Nain visible on the other side, Carmel heaving its long\nform far off on the right, and Nazareth nestling a mile or two away on\nthe plateau on which they had halted.",
        "It was a sight of extraordinary peace, and seemed an extract from some\nold picture-book designed centuries ago. Here was no crowd of roofs, no\npressure of hot humanity, no terrible evidences of civilisation and\nmanufactory and strenuous, fruitless effort. A few tired Jews had come\nback to this quiet little land, as old people may return to their native\nplace, with no hope of renewing their youth, or refinding their ideals,\nbut with a kind of sentimentality that prevails so often over more\nlogical motives, and a few more barrack-like houses had been added here\nand there to the obscure villages in sight. But it was very much as it\nhad been a hundred years ago.",
        "The plain was half shadowed by Carmel, and half in dusty golden light.\nOverhead the clear Eastern sky was flushed with rose, as it had flushed\nfor Abraham, Jacob, and the Son of David. There was no little cloud\nhere, as a man’s hand, over the sea, charged with both promise and\nterror; no sound of chariot-wheels from earth or heaven, no vision of\nheavenly horses such as a young man had seen thirty centuries ago in\nthis very sky. Here was the old earth and the old heaven, unchanged and\nunchangeable; the patient, returning spring had starred the thin soil\nwith flowers of Bethlehem, and those glorious lilies to which Solomon’s\nscarlet garments might not be compared. There was no whisper from the\nThrone as when Gabriel had once stooped through this very air to hail\nHer who was blessed among women, no breath of promise or hope beyond\nthat which God sends through every movement of His created robe of life.",
        "As the two halted, and the horses looked out with steady, inquisitive\neyes at the immensity of light and air beneath them, a soft hooting cry\nbroke out, and a shepherd passed below along the hillside a hundred\nyards away, trailing his long shadow behind him, and to the mellow\ntinkle of bells his flock came after, a troop of obedient sheep and\nwilful goats, cropping and following and cropping again as they went on\nto the fold, called by name in that sad minor voice of him who knew\neach, and led instead of driving. The soft clanking grew fainter, the\nshadow of the shepherd shot once to their very feet, as he topped the\nrise, and vanished again as he stepped down once more; and the call grew\nfainter yet, and ceased.",
        "The Pope lifted His hand to His eyes for an instant, then smoothed it\ndown His face.",
        "He nodded across to a dim patch of white walls glimmering through the\nviolet haze of the falling twilight.",
        "“That place, father,” He said, “what is its name?”",
        "The Syrian priest looked across, back once more at the Pope, and across\nagain.",
        "“That among the palms, Holiness?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“That is Megiddo,” he said. “Some call it Armageddon.”",
