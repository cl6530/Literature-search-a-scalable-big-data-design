        "Each century, or sometimes each generation, is distinguished by\nsome especial interest among those who are given to fancies–not\nto call them fads. Thus, at the present time, the cultivated few\nare taken up with what they choose to term the “new thought,” or\nthe “new criticism,” or, on the other hand, with socialistic\ntheories and projects. Thirty years ago, when Oscar Wilde was\nregarded seriously by some people, there were many who made a cult\nof estheticism. It was just as interesting when their leader–",
        "or when Sir William Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan guyed him as\nBunthorne in “Patience.”",
        "When Charles Kingsley was a great expounder of British common\nsense, “muscular Christianity” was a phrase which was taken up by\nmany followers. A little earlier, Puseyism and a primitive form of\nsocialism were in vogue with the intellectuals. There are just as\nmany different fashions in thought as in garments, and they come\nand go without any particular reason. To-day, they are discussed\nand practised everywhere. To-morrow, they are almost forgotten in\nthe rapid pursuit of something new.",
        "Forty years before the French Revolution burst forth with all its\nthunderings, France and Germany were affected by what was\ngenerally styled “sensibility.” Sensibility was the sister of\nsentimentality and the half-sister of sentiment. Sentiment is a\nfine thing in itself. It is consistent with strength and humor and\nmanliness; but sentimentality and sensibility are poor cheeping\ncreatures that run scuttering along the ground, quivering and\nwhimpering and asking for perpetual sympathy, which they do not at\nall deserve.",
        "No one need be ashamed of sentiment. It simply gives temper to the\nblade, and mellowness to the intellect. Sensibility, on the other\nhand, is full of shivers and shakes and falsetto notes and\nsqueaks. It is, in fact, all humbug, just as sentiment is often\nall truth.",
        "Therefore, to find an interesting phase of human folly, we may\nlook back to the years which lie between 1756 and 1793 as the era\nof sensibility. The great prophets of this false god, or goddess,\nwere Rousseau in France and Goethe with Schiller in Germany,\ntogether with a host of midgets who shook and shivered in\nimitation of their masters. It is not for us to catalogue these\npersons. Some of them were great figures in literature and\nphilosophy, and strong enough to shake aside the silliness of\nsensibility; but others, while they professed to be great as\nwriters or philosophers, are now remembered only because their\ndevotion to sensibility made them conspicuous in their own time.\nThey dabbled in one thing and another; they “cribbed” from every\npopular writer of the day. The only thing that actually belonged\nto them was a high degree of sensibility.",
        "And what, one may ask, was this precious thing–this sensibility?",
        "It was really a sort of St. Vitus’s dance of the mind, and almost\nof the body. When two persons, in any way interested in each\nother, were brought into the same room, one of them appeared to be\nseized with a rotary movement. The voice rose to a higher pitch\nthan usual, and assumed a tremolo. Then, if the other person was\nalso endowed with sensibility, he or she would rotate and quake in\nsomewhat the same manner. Their cups of tea would be considerably\nagitated. They would move about in as unnatural a manner as\npossible; and when they left the room, they would do so with\ngaspings and much waste of breath.",
        "This was not an exhibition of love–or, at least, not necessarily\nso. You might exhibit sensibility before a famous poet, or a\ngallant soldier, or a celebrated traveler–or, for that matter,\nbefore a remarkable buffoon, like Cagliostro, or a freak, like\nKaspar Hauser.",
        "It is plain enough that sensibility was entirely an abnormal\nthing, and denoted an abnormal state of mind. Only among people\nlike the Germans and French of that period, who were forbidden to\ntake part in public affairs, could it have flourished so long, and\nhave put forth such rank and fetid outgrowths. From it sprang the\n“elective affinities” of Goethe, and the loose morality of the\nFrench royalists, which rushed on into the roaring sea of\ninfidelity, blasphemy, and anarchy of the Revolution.",
        "Of all the historic figures of that time, there is just one which\nto-day stands forth as representing sensibility. In her own time\nshe was thought to be something of a philosopher, and something\nmore of a novelist. She consorted with all the clever men and\nwomen of her age. But now she holds a minute niche in history\nbecause of the fact that Napoleon stooped to hate her, and because\nshe personifies sensibility.",
        "Criticism has stripped from her the rags and tatters of the\nphilosophy which was not her own. It is seen that she was indebted\nto the brains of others for such imaginative bits of fiction as\nshe put forth in Delphine and Corinne; but as the exponent of\nsensibility she remains unique. This woman was Anne Louise\nGermaine Necker, usually known as Mme. de Stael.",
        "There was much about Mile. Necker’s parentage that made her\ninteresting. Her father was the Genevese banker and minister of\nLouis XVI, who failed wretchedly in his attempts to save the\nfinances of France. Her mother, Suzanne Curchod, as a young girl,\nhad won the love of the famous English historian, Edward Gibbon.\nShe had first refused him, and then almost frantically tried to\nget him back; but by this time Gibbon was more comfortable in\nsingle life and less infatuated with Mlle. Curchod, who presently\nmarried Jacques Necker.",
        "M. Necker’s money made his daughter a very celebrated “catch.” Her\nmother brought her to Paris when the French capital was brilliant\nbeyond description, and yet was tottering to its fall. The\nrumblings of the Revolution could be heard by almost every ear;\nand yet society and the court, refusing to listen, plunged into\nthe wildest revelry under the leadership of the giddy Marie\nAntoinette.",
        "It was here that the young girl was initiated into the most\nelegant forms of luxury, and met the cleverest men of that time–\nVoltaire, Rousseau, Lamartine, Chateaubriand, Volney. She set\nherself to be the most accomplished woman of her day, not merely\nin belles lettres, but in the natural and political sciences.\nThus, when her father was drawing up his monograph on the French\nfinances, Germaine labored hard over a supplementary report,\nstudying documents, records, and the most complicated statistics,\nso that she might obtain a mastery of the subject.",
        "“I mean to know everything that anybody knows,” she said, with an\narrogance which was rather admired in so young a woman.",
        "But, unfortunately, her mind was not great enough to fulfil her\naspiration. The most she ever achieved was a fair knowledge of\nmany things–a knowledge which seemed surprising to the average\nman, but which was superficial enough to the accomplished\nspecialist.",
        "In her twentieth year (1786) it was thought best that she should\nmarry. Her revels, as well as her hard studies, had told upon her\nhealth, and her mother believed that she could not be at once a\nblue-stocking and a woman of the world.",
        "There was something very odd about the relation that existed\nbetween the young girl and this mother of hers. In the Swiss\nprovince where they had both been born, the mother had been\nconsidered rather bold and forward. Her penchant for Gibbon was\nonly one of a number of adventures that have been told about her.\nShe was by no means coy with the gallants of Geneva. Yet, after\nher marriage, and when she came to Paris, she seemed to be\ntransformed into a sort of Swiss Puritan.",
        "As such, she undertook her daughter’s bringing up, and was\nextremely careful about everything that Germaine did and about the\ncompany she kept. On the other hand, the daughter, who in the city\nof Calvin had been rather dull and quiet in her ways, launched out\ninto a gaiety such as she had never known in Switzerland. Mother\nand daughter, in fact, changed parts. The country beauty of Geneva\nbecame the prude of Paris, while the quiet, unemotional young\nGenevese became the light of all the Parisian salons, whether\nsocial or intellectual.",
        "The mother was a very beautiful woman. The daughter, who was to\nbecome so famous, is best described by those two very\nuncomplimentary English words, “dumpy” and “frumpy.” She had\nbulging eyes–which are not emphasized in the flattering portrait\nby Gerard–and her hair was unbecomingly dressed. There are\nreasons for thinking that Germaine bitterly hated her mother, and\nwas intensely jealous of her charm of person. It may be also that\nMme. Necker envied the daughter’s cleverness, even though that\ncleverness was little more, in the end, than the borrowing of\nbrilliant things from other persons. At any rate, the two never\ncared for each other, and Germaine gave to her father the\naffection which her mother neither received nor sought.",
        "It was perhaps to tame the daughter’s exuberance that a marriage\nwas arranged for Mlle. Necker with the Baron de Stael-Holstein,\nwho then represented the court of Sweden at Paris. Many eyebrows\nwere lifted when this match was announced. Baron de Stael had no\npersonal charm, nor any reputation for wit. His standing in the\ndiplomatic corps was not very high. His favorite occupations were\nplaying cards and drinking enormous quantities of punch. Could he\nbe considered a match for the extremely clever Mlle. Necker, whose\nfather had an enormous fortune, and who was herself considered a\ngem of wit and mental power, ready to discuss political economy,\nor the romantic movement of socialism, or platonic love?",
        "Many differed about this. Mlle. Necker was, to be sure, rich and\nclever; but the Baron de Stael was of an old family, and had a\ntitle. Moreover, his easy-going ways–even his punch-drinking and\nhis card-playing–made him a desirable husband at that time of\nFrench social history, when the aristocracy wished to act exactly\nas it pleased, with wanton license, and when an embassy was a very\nconvenient place into which an indiscreet ambassadress might\nretire when the mob grew dangerous. For Paris was now approaching\nthe time of revolution, and all “aristocrats” were more or less in\ndanger.",
        "At first Mme. de Stael rather sympathized with the outbreak of the\npeople; but later their excesses drove her back into sympathy with\nthe royalists. It was then that she became indiscreet and abused\nthe privilege of the embassy in giving shelter to her friends. She\nwas obliged to make a sudden flight across the frontier, whence\nshe did not return until Napoleon loomed up, a political giant on\nthe horizon–victorious general, consul, and emperor.",
        "Mme. de Stael’s relations with Napoleon have, as I remarked above,\nbeen among her few titles to serious remembrance. The Corsican\neagle and the dumpy little Genevese make, indeed, a peculiar pair;\nand for this reason writers have enhanced the oddities of the\npicture.",
        "“Napoleon,” says one, “did not wish any one to be near him who was\nas clever as himself.”",
        "“No,” adds another, “Mme. de Stael made a dead set at Napoleon,\nbecause she wished to conquer and achieve the admiration of\neverybody, even of the greatest man who ever lived.”",
        "“Napoleon found her to be a good deal of a nuisance,” observes a\nthird. “She knew too much, and was always trying to force her\nknowledge upon others.”",
        "The legend has sprung up that Mme. de Stael was too wise and witty\nto be acceptable to Napoleon; and many women repeated with unction\nthat the conqueror of Europe was no match for this frowsy little\nwoman. It is, perhaps, worth while to look into the facts, and to\ndecide whether Napoleon was really of so petty a nature as to feel\nhimself inferior to this rather comic creature, even though at the\ntime many people thought her a remarkable genius.",
        "In the first place, knowing Napoleon, as we have come to know him\nthrough the pages of Mme. de Remusat, Frederic Masson, and others,\nwe can readily imagine the impatience with which the great soldier\nwould sit at dinner, hastening to finish his meal, crowding the\nwhole ceremony into twenty minutes, gulping a glass or two of wine\nand a cup of coffee, and then being interrupted by a fussy little\nfemale who wanted to talk about the ethics of history, or the\npossibility of a new form of government. Napoleon, himself, was\nmaking history, and writing it in fire and flame; and as for\ngovernments, he invented governments all over Europe as suited his\nimperial will. What patience could he have with one whom an\nEnglish writer has rather unkindly described as “an ugly coquette,\nan old woman who made a ridiculous marriage, a blue-stocking, who\nspent much of her time in pestering men of genius, and drawing\nfrom them sarcastic comment behind their backs?”",
        "Napoleon was not the sort of a man to be routed in discussion, but\nhe was most decidedly the sort of man to be bored and irritated by\npedantry. Consequently, he found Mme. de Stael a good deal of a\nnuisance in the salons of Paris and its vicinity. He cared not the\nleast for her epigrams. She might go somewhere else and write all\nthe epigrams she pleased. When he banished her, in 1803, she\nmerely crossed the Rhine into Germany, and established herself at\nWeimar.",
        "The emperor received her son, Auguste de Stael-Holstein, with much\ngood humor, though he refused the boy’s appeal on behalf of his\nmother.",
        "“My dear baron,” said Napoleon, “if your mother were to be in\nParis for two months, I should really be obliged to lock her up in\none of the castles, which would be most unpleasant treatment for\nme to show a lady. No, let her go anywhere else and we can get\nalong perfectly. All Europe is open to her–Rome, Vienna, St.\nPetersburg; and if she wishes to write libels on me, England is a\nconvenient and inexpensive place. Only Paris is just a little too\nnear!”",
        "Thus the emperor gibed the boy–he was only fifteen or sixteen–\nand made fun of the exiled blue-stocking; but there was not a sign\nof malice in what he said, nor, indeed, of any serious feeling at\nall. The legend about Napoleon and Mme. de Stael must, therefore,\ngo into the waste-basket, except in so far as it is true that she\nsucceeded in boring him.",
        "For the rest, she was an earlier George Sand–unattractive in\nperson, yet able to attract; loving love for love’s sake, though\nseldom receiving it in return; throwing herself at the head of\nevery distinguished man, and generally finding that he regarded\nher overtures with mockery. To enumerate the men for whom she\nprofessed to care would be tedious, since the record of her\npassions has no reality about it, save, perhaps, with two\nexceptions.",
        "She did care deeply and sincerely for Henri Benjamin Constant, the\nbrilliant politician and novelist. He was one of her coterie in\nParis, and their common political sentiments formed a bond of\nfriendship between them. Constant was banished by Napoleon in\n1802, and when Mme. de Stael followed him into exile a year later\nhe joined her in Germany.",
        "The story of their relations was told by Constant in Adolphe,\nwhile Mme. de Stael based Delphine on her experiences with him. It\nseems that he was puzzled by her ardor; she was infatuated by his\ngenius. Together they went through all the phases of the tender\npassion; and yet, at intervals, they would tire of each other and\nseparate for a while, and she would amuse herself with other men.\nAt last she really believed that her love for him was entirely\nworn out.",
        "“I always loved my lovers more than they loved me,” she said once,\nand it was true.",
        "Yet, on the other hand, she was frankly false to all of them, and\nhence arose these intervals. In one of them she fell in with a\nyoung Italian named Rocca, and by way of a change she not only\namused herself with him, but even married him. At this time–1811\n–she was forty-five, while Rocca was only twenty-three–a young\nsoldier who had fought in Spain, and who made eager love to the\nshe-philosopher when he was invalided at Geneva.",
        "The marriage was made on terms imposed by the middle-aged woman\nwho became his bride. In the first place, it was to be kept\nsecret; and second, she would not take her husband’s name, but he\nmust pass himself off as her lover, even though she bore him\nchildren. The reason she gave for this extraordinary exhibition of\nher vanity was that a change of name on her part would put\neverybody out.",
        "“In fact,” she said, “if Mme. de Stael were to change her name, it\nwould unsettle the heads of all Europe!”",
        "And so she married Rocca, who was faithful to her to the end,\nthough she grew extremely plain and querulous, while he became\ndeaf and soon lost his former charm. Her life was the life of a\nwoman who had, in her own phrase, “attempted everything\"; and yet\nshe had accomplished nothing that would last. She was loved by a\nman of genius, but he did not love her to the end. She was loved\nby a man of action, and she tired of him very soon. She had a\nwonderful reputation for her knowledge of history and philosophy,\nand yet what she knew of those subjects is now seen to be merely\nthe scraps and borrowings of others.",
        "Something she did when she introduced the romantic literature into\nFrance; and there are passages from her writings which seem worthy\nof preservation. For instance, we may quote her outburst with\nregard to unhappy marriages. “It was the subject,” says Mr.\nGribble, “on which she had begun to think before she was married,\nand which continued to haunt her long after she was left a widow;\nthough one suspects that the word ’marriage’ became a form of\nspeech employed to describe her relations, not with her husband,\nbut with her lovers.” The passage to which I refer is as follows:",
        "In an unhappy marriage, there is a violence of distress surpassing\nall other sufferings in the world. A woman’s whole soul depends\nupon the conjugal tie. To struggle against fate alone, to journey\nto the grave without a friend to support you or to regret you, is\nan isolation of which the deserts of Arabia give but a faint and\nfeeble idea. When all the treasure of your youth has been given in\nvain, when you can no longer hope that the reflection of these\nfirst rays will shine upon the end of your life, when there is\nnothing in the dusk to remind you of the dawn, and when the\ntwilight is pale and colorless as a livid specter that precedes\nthe night, your heart revolts, and you feel that you have been\nrobbed of the gifts of God upon earth.",
        "Equally striking is another prose passage of hers, which seems\nless the careful thought of a philosopher than the screeching of a\ntermagant. It is odd that the first two sentences recall two\nfamous lines of Byron:",
        "The passage by Mme. de Stael is longer and less piquant:",
        "Love is woman’s whole existence. It is only an episode in the\nlives of men. Reputation, honor, esteem, everything depends upon\nhow a woman conducts herself in this regard; whereas, according to\nthe rules of an unjust world, the laws of morality itself are\nsuspended in men’s relations with women. They may pass as good\nmen, though they have caused women the most terrible suffering\nwhich it is in the power of one human being to inflict upon\nanother. They may be regarded as loyal, though they have betrayed\nthem. They may have received from a woman marks of a devotion\nwhich would so link two friends, two fellow soldiers, that either\nwould feel dishonored if he forgot them, and they may consider\nthemselves free of all obligations by attributing the services to\nlove–as if this additional gift of love detracted from the value\nof the rest!",
        "One cannot help noticing how lacking in neatness of expression is\nthis woman who wrote so much. It is because she wrote so much that\nshe wrote in such a muffled manner. It is because she thought so\nmuch that her reflections were either not her own, or were never\nclear. It is because she loved so much, and had so many lovers–\nBenjamin Constant; Vincenzo Monti, the Italian poet; M. de\nNarbonne, and others, as well as young Rocca–that she found both\nlove and lovers tedious.",
        "She talked so much that her conversation was almost always mere\npersonal opinion. Thus she told Goethe that he never was really\nbrilliant until after he had got through a bottle of champagne.\nSchiller said that to talk with her was to have a “rough time,\"\nand that after she left him, he always felt like a man who was\njust getting over a serious illness. She never had time to do\nanything very well.",
        "There is an interesting glimpse of her in the recollections of Dr.\nBollmann, at the period when Mme. de Stael was in her prime. The\nworthy doctor set her down as a genius–an extraordinary,\neccentric woman in all that she did. She slept but a few hours out\nof the twenty-four, and was uninterruptedly and fearfully busy all\nthe rest of the time. While her hair was being dressed, and even\nwhile she breakfasted, she used to keep on writing, nor did she\never rest sufficiently to examine what she had written.",
        "Such then was Mme. de Stael, a type of the time in which she\nlived, so far as concerns her worship of sensibility–of\nsensibility, and not of love; for love is too great to be so\nscattered and made a thing to prattle of, to cheapen, and thus\ndestroy. So we find at the last that Germaine de Stael, though she\nwas much read and much feted and much followed, came finally to\nthat last halting-place where confessedly she was merely an old\nwoman, eccentric, and unattractive. She sued her former lovers for\nthe money she had lent them, she scolded and found fault–as\nperhaps befits her age.",
        "But such is the natural end of sensibility, and of the woman who\ntypifies it for succeeding generations.",
