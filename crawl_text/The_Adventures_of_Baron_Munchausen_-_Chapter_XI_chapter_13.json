        "  An interesting account of the Baron’s ancestors–A quarrel\n  relative to the spot where Noah built his ark–The history of the\n  sling, and its properties–A favourite poet introduced upon no\n  very reputable occasion–queen Elizabeth’s abstinence–The Baron’s\n  father crosses from England to Holland upon a marine horse, which\n  he sells for seven hundred ducats.",
        "You wish (I can see by your countenances) I would inform you how I\nbecame possessed of such a treasure as the sling just mentioned. (Here\nfacts must be held sacred.) Thus then it was: I am a descendant of the\nwife of Uriah, whom we all know David was intimate with; she had\nseveral children by his majesty; they quarrelled once upon a matter of\nthe first consequence, viz., the spot where Noah’s ark was built, and\nwhere it rested after the flood. A separation consequently ensued. She\nhad often heard him speak of this sling as his most valuable treasure:\nthis she stole the night they parted; it was missed before she got out\nof his dominions, and she was pursued by no less than six of the\nking’s body-guards: however, by using it herself she hit the first of\nthem (for one was more active in the pursuit than the rest) where\nDavid did Goliath, and killed him on the spot. His companions were so\nalarmed at his fall that they retired, and left Uriah’s wife to pursue\nher journey. She took with her, I should have informed you before, her\nfavourite son by this connection, to whom she bequeathed the sling;\nand thus it has, without interruption, descended from father to son\ntill it came into my possession. One of its possessors, my great-\ngreat-great-grandfather, who lived about two hundred and fifty years\nago, was upon a visit to England, and became intimate with a poet who\nwas a great deer-stealer; I think his name was Shakespeare: he\nfrequently borrowed this sling, and with it killed so much of Sir\nThomas Lucy’s venison, that he narrowly escaped the fate of my two\nfriends at Gibraltar. Poor Shakespeare was imprisoned, and my ancestor\nobtained his freedom in a very singular manner. Queen Elizabeth was\nthen on the throne, but grown so indolent, that every trifling matter\nwas a trouble to her; dressing, undressing, eating, drinking, and some\nother offices which shall be nameless, made life a burden to her; all\nthese things he enabled her to do without, or by a deputy! and what do\nyou think was the only return she could prevail upon him to accept for\nsuch eminent services? setting Shakespeare at liberty! Such was his\naffection for that famous writer, that he would have shortened his own\ndays to add to the number of his friend’s.",
        "I do not hear that any of the queen’s subjects, particularly the\nbeef-eaters, as they are vulgarly called to this day, however they\nmight be struck with the novelty at the time, much approved of her\nliving totally without food. She did not survive the practice herself\nabove seven years and a half.",
        "My father, who was the immediate possessor of this sling before me,\ntold me the following anecdote:–",
        "He was walking by the sea-shore at Harwich, with this sling in his\npocket; before his paces had covered a mile he was attacked by a\nfierce animal called a seahorse, open-mouthed, who ran at him with\ngreat fury; he hesitated a moment, then took out his sling, retreated\nback about a hundred yards, stooped for a couple of pebbles, of which\nthere were plenty under his feet, and slung them both so dexterously\nat the animal, that each stone put out an eye, and lodged in the\ncavities which their removal had occasioned. He now got upon his back,\nand drove him into the sea; for the moment he lost his sight he lost\nalso ferocity, and became as tame as possible: the sling was placed as\na bridle in his mouth; he was guided with the greatest facility across\nthe ocean, and in less than three hours they both arrived on the\nopposite shore, which is about thirty leagues. The master of the\nThree Cups, at Helvoetsluys, in Holland, purchased this marine\nhorse, to make an exhibition of, for seven hundred ducats, which was\nupwards of three hundred pounds, and the next day my father paid his\npassage back in the packet to Harwich.",
        "–My father made several curious observations in this passage, which\nI will relate hereafter.",
