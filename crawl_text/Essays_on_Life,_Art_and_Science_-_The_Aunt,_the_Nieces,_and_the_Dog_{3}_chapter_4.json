        "\nSamuel Butler (1835 - 1902)\nEnglish composer, novelist, and satiric author\n",

        "When a thing is old, broken, and useless we throw it on the dust-\nheap, but when it is sufficiently old, sufficiently broken, and\nsufficiently useless we give money for it, put it into a museum, and\nread papers over it which people come long distances to hear.  By-\nand-by, when the whirligig of time has brought on another revenge,\nthe museum itself becomes a dust-heap, and remains so till after\nlong ages it is re-discovered, and valued as belonging to a neo-\nrubbish age—containing, perhaps, traces of a still older paleo-\nrubbish civilisation.  So when people are old, indigent, and in all\nrespects incapable, we hold them in greater and greater contempt as\ntheir poverty and impotence increase, till they reach the pitch when\nthey are actually at the point to die, whereon they become sublime.\nThen we place every resource our hospitals can command at their\ndisposal, and show no stint in our consideration for them.",
        "It is the same with all our interests.  We care most about extremes\nof importance and of unimportance; but extremes of importance are\ntainted with fear, and a very imperfect fear casteth out love.\nExtremes of unimportance cannot hurt us, therefore we are well\ndisposed towards them; the means may come to do so, therefore we do\nnot love them.  Hence we pick a fly out of a milk-jug and watch with\npleasure over its recovery, for we are confident that under no\nconceivable circumstances will it want to borrow money from us; but\nwe feel less sure about a mouse, so we show it no quarter.  The\ncompilers of our almanacs well know this tendency of our natures, so\nthey tell us, not when Noah went into the ark, nor when the temple\nof Jerusalem was dedicated, but that Lindley Murray, grammarian,\ndied January 16, 1826.  This is not because they could not find so\nmany as three hundred and sixty-five events of considerable interest\nsince the creation of the world, but because they well know we would\nrather hear of something less interesting.  We care most about what\nconcerns us either very closely, or so little that practically we\nhave nothing whatever to do with it.",
        "I once asked a young Italian, who professed to have a considerable\nknowledge of English literature, which of all our poems pleased him\nbest.  He replied without a moment’s hesitation:-",
        "He said this was better than anything in Italian.  They had Dante\nand Tasso, and ever so many more great poets, but they had nothing\ncomparable to “Hey diddle diddle,” nor had he been able to conceive\nhow any one could have written it.  Did I know the author’s name,\nand had we given him a statue?  On this I told him of the young lady\nof Harrow who would go to church in a barrow, and plied him with\nwhatever rhyming nonsense I could call to mind, but it was no use;\nall of these things had an element of reality that robbed them of\nhalf their charm, whereas “Hey diddle diddle” had nothing in it that\ncould conceivably concern him.",
        "So again it is with the things that gall us most.  What is it that\nrises up against us at odd times and smites us in the face again and\nagain for years after it has happened?  That we spent all the best\nyears of our life in learning what we have found to be a swindle,\nand to have been known to be a swindle by those who took money for\nmisleading us?  That those on whom we most leaned most betrayed us?\nThat we have only come to feel our strength when there is little\nstrength left of any kind to feel?  These things will hardly much\ndisturb a man of ordinary good temper.  But that he should have said\nthis or that little unkind and wanton saying; that he should have\ngone away from this or that hotel and given a shilling too little to\nthe waiter; that his clothes were shabby at such or such a garden-\nparty—these things gall us as a corn will sometimes do, though the\nloss of a limb way not be seriously felt.",
        "I have been reminded lately of these considerations with more than\ncommon force by reading the very voluminous correspondence left by\nmy grandfather, Dr. Butler, of Shrewsbury, whose memoirs I am\nengaged in writing.  I have found a large number of interesting\nletters on subjects of serious import, but must confess that it is\nto the hardly less numerous lighter letters that I have been most\nattracted, nor do I feel sure that my eminent namesake did not share\nmy predilection.  Among other letters in my possession I have one\nbundle that has been kept apart, and has evidently no connection\nwith Dr. Butler’s own life.  I cannot use these letters, therefore,\nfor my book, but over and above the charm of their inspired\nspelling, I find them of such an extremely trivial nature that I\nincline to hope the reader may derive as much amusement from them as\nI have done myself, and venture to give them the publicity here\nwhich I must refuse them in my book.  The dates and signatures have,\nwith the exception of Mrs. Newton’s, been carefully erased, but I\nhave collected that they were written by the two servants of a\nsingle lady who resided at no great distance from London, to two\nnieces of the said lady who lived in London itself.  The aunt never\nwrites, but always gets one of the servants to do so for her.  She\nappears either as “your aunt” or as “She\"; her name is not given,\nbut she is evidently looked upon with a good deal of awe by all who\nhad to do with her.",
        "The letters almost all of them relate to visits either of the aunt\nto London, or of the nieces to the aunt’s home, which, from\noccasional allusions to hopping, I gather to have been in Kent,\nSussex, or Surrey.  I have arranged them to the best of my power,\nand take the following to be the earliest.  It has no signature, but\nis not in the handwriting of the servant who styles herself\nElizabeth, or Mrs. Newton.  It runs:-",
        "“MADAM,—Your Aunt Wishes me to inform you she will be glad if you\nwill let hir know if you think of coming To hir House thiss month or\nNext as she cannot have you in September on a kount of the Hoping If\nyou ar coming she thinkes she had batter Go to London on the Day you\ncom to hir House the says you shall have everry Thing raddy for you\nat hir House and Mrs. Newton to meet you and stay with you till She\nreturnes a gann.",
        "“if you arnot Coming thiss Summer She will be in London before thiss\nMonth is out and will Sleep on the Sofy As She willnot be in London\nmore thann two nits. and She Says she willnot truble you on anny a\nkount as She Will returne the Same Day before She will plage you\nanny more. but She thanks you for asking hir to London. but She says\nShe cannot leve the house at prassant She sayhir Survants ar to do\nfor you as she cannot lodge yours nor she willnot have thim in at\nthe house anny more to brake and destroy hir thinks and beslive hir\nand make up Lies by hir and Skandel as your too did She says she\nmens to pay fore 2 Nits and one day, She says the Pepelwill let hir\nhave it if you ask thim to let hir:  you Will be so good as to let\nhir know sun:  wish She is to do, as She says She dos not care anny\nthing a bout it. which way tiss she is batter than She was and\ndesirs hir Love to bouth bouth.",
        "“Your aunt wises to know how the silk Clocks ar madup [how the silk\ncloaks are made up] with a Cape or a wood as she is a goin to have\none madeup to rideout in in hir littel shas [chaise].",
        "“Charles is a butty and so good.",
        "“Mr & Mrs Newton ar quite wall & desires to be remembered to you.”",
        "I can throw no light on the meaning of the verb to “beslive.”  Each\nletter in the MS. is so admirably formed that there can be no\nquestion about the word being as I have given it.  Nor have I been\nable to discover what is referred to by the words “Charles is a\nbutty and so good.”  We shall presently meet with a Charles who\n“flies in the Fier,” but that Charles appears to have been in\nLondon, whereas this one is evidently in Kent, or wherever the aunt\nlived.",
        "The next letter is from Mrs. Newton",
        "“DER Miss —, I Receve your Letter your Aunt is vary Ill and\nLowspireted I Donte think your Aunt wood Git up all Day if My Sister\nWasnot to Persage her We all Think hir lif is two monopolous. you\nWish to know Who Was Liveing With your Aunt. that is My Sister and\nWillian—and Cariline—as Cock and Old Poll Pepper is Come to Stay\nWith her a Littel Wile and I hoped [hopped] for Your Aunt, and Harry\nhas Worked for your Aunt all the Summer.  Your Aunt and Harry Whent\nto the Wells Races and Spent a very Pleasant Day your Aunt has Lost\nOld Fanney Sow She Died about a Week a Go Harry he Wanted your Aunt\nto have her killed and send her to London and Shee Wold Fech her 11\npounds the Farmers have Lost a Greet Deal of Cattel such as Hogs and\nCows What theay call the Plage I Whent to your Aunt as you Wish Mee\nto Do But She Told Mee She Did not wont aney Boddy She Told Mee She\nShould Like to Come up to see you But She Cant Come know for she is\nBoddyley ill and Harry Donte Work there know But he Go up there Once\nin Two or Three Day Harry Offered is self to Go up to Live With your\nAunt But She Made him know Ancer.  I hay Been up to your Aunt at\nWork for 5 Weeks Hopping and Ragluting Your Aunt Donte Eat nor Drink\nBut vary Littel indeed.",
        "“I am Happy to Say We are Both Quite Well and I am Glad no hear you\nare Both Quite Well",
        "“MRS NEWTON.”",
        "This seems to have made the nieces propose to pay a visit to their\naunt, perhaps to try and relieve the monopoly of her existence and\ncheer her up a little.  In their letter, doubtless, the dog motive\nis introduced that is so finely developed presently by Mrs. Newton.\nI should like to have been able to give the theme as enounced by the\nnieces themselves, but their letters are not before me.  Mrs. Newton\nwrites:-",
        "“MY DEAR GIRLS,—Your Aunt receiv your Letter your Aunt will Be vary\nglad to see you as it quite a greeable if it tis to you and Shee is\nQuite Willing to Eair the beds and the Rooms if you Like to Trust to\nhir and the Servantes; if not I may Go up there as you Wish.  My\nSister Sleeps in the Best Room as she allways Did and the Coock in\nthe garret and you Can have the Rooms the same as you allways Did as\nyour Aunt Donte set in the Parlour She Continlery Sets in the\nCiching. your Aunt says she Cannot Part from the dog know hows and\nShe Says he will not hurt you for he is Like a Child and I can\nsafeley say My Self he wonte hurt you as She Cannot Sleep in the\nRoom With out him as he allWay Sleep in the Same Room as She Dose.\nyour Aunt is agreeable to Git in What Coles and Wood you Wish for I\nam know happy to say your Aunt is in as Good health as ever She Was\nand She is happy to hear you are Both Well your Aunt Wishes for\nAncer By Return of Post.”",
        "The nieces replied that their aunt must choose between the dog and\nthem, and Mrs. Newton sends a second letter which brings her\ndevelopment to a climax.  It runs:-",
        "“DEAR MISS —, I have Receve your Letter and i Whent up to your Aunt\nas you Wish me and i Try to Perveal With her about the Dog But she\nWold not Put the Dog away nor it alow him to Be Tied up But She\nStill Wishes you to Come as Shee says the Dog Shall not interrup you\nfor She Donte alow the Dog nor it the Cats to Go in the Parlour\nnever sence She has had it Donup ferfere of Spoiling the Paint your\nAunt think it vary Strange you Should Be so vary Much afraid of a\nDog and She says you Cant Go out in London But What you are up a\ngance one and She says She Wonte Trust the Dog in know one hands But\nher Owne for She is afraid theay Will not fill is Belley as he Lives\nupon Rost Beeff and Rost and Boil Moutten Wich he Eats More then the\nServantes in the House there is not aney One Wold Beable to Give\nSattefacktion upon that account Harry offerd to Take the Dog But She\nWood not Trust him in our hands so I Cold not Do aney thing With her\nyour Aunt youse to Tell Me When we was at your House in London She\nDid not know how to make you amens and i Told her know it was the\nTime to Do it But i Considder She sets the Dog Before you your Aunt\nkeep know Beer know Sprits know Wines in the House of aney Sort\nOneley a Little Barl of Wine I made her in the Summer the Workmen\nand servantes are a Blige to Drink wauter Morning Noon and Night\nyour Aunt the Same She Donte Low her Self aney Tee nor Coffee But is\nLoocking Wonderful Well",
        "“I Still Remane your Humble Servant Mrs Newton",
        "“I am vary sorry to think the Dog Perventes your Comeing",
        "“I am Glad to hear you are Both Well and we are the same.”",
        "The nieces remained firm, and from the following letter it is plain\nthe aunt gave way.  The dog motive is repeated pianissimo, and is\nnot returned to—not at least by Mrs. Newton.",
        "“DEAR Miss —, I Receve your Letter on Thursday i Whent to your Aunt\nand i see her and She is a Greable to everry thing i asked her and\nseme so vary Much Please to see you Both Next Tuseday and she has\nsent for the Faggots to Day and she Will Send for the Coles to\nMorrow and i will Go up there to Morrow Morning and Make the Fiers\nand Tend to the Beds and sleep in it Till you Come Down your Aunt\nsends her Love to you Both and she is Quite well your Aunt Wishes\nyou wold Write againe Before you Come as she ma Expeckye and the Dog\nis not to Gointo the Parlor a Tall",
        "“your Aunt kind Love to you Both & hopes you Wonte Fail in Coming\naccording to Prommis",
        "MRS NEWTON.”",
        "From a later letter it appears that the nieces did not pay their\nvisit after all, and what is worse a letter had miscarried, and the\naunt sat up expecting them from seven till twelve at night, and\nHarry had paid for “Faggots and Coles quarter of Hund.  Faggots Half\ntun of Coles 1l. 1s. 3d.”  Shortly afterwards, however, “She” again\ntalks of coming up to London herself and writes through her servant\n-",
        "“My Dear girls i Receve your kind letter & I am happy to hear you ar\nboth Well and I Was in hopes of seeing of you Both Down at My House\nthis spring to stay a Wile I am Quite well my self in Helth But vary\nLow Spireted I am vary sorry to hear the Misforting of Poor charles\n& how he cum to flie in the Fier I cannot think.  I should like to\nknow if he is dead or a Live, and I shall come to London in August &\nstay three or four daies if it is agreable to you.  Mrs. Newton has\nlost her mother in Law 4 day March & I hope you send me word Wather\ncharles is Dead or a Live as soon as possible, and will you send me\nword what Little Betty is for I cannot make her out.”",
        "The next letter is a new handwriting, and tells the nieces of their\naunt’s death in the the following terms:  -",
        "“DEAR Miss —, It is my most painful duty to inform you that your\ndear aunt expired this morning comparatively easy as Hannah informs\nme and in so doing restored her soul to the custody of him whom she\nconsidered to be alone worthy of its care.",
        "“The doctor had visited her about five minutes previously and had\napplied a blister.",
        "“You and your sister will I am sure excuse further details at\npresent and believe me with kindest remembrances to remain",
        "“Yours truly, &c.”",
        "After a few days a lawyer’s letter informs the nieces that their\naunt had left them the bulk of her not very considerable property,\nbut had charged them with an annuity of 1 pound a week to be paid to\nHarry and Mrs. Newton so long as the dog lived.",
        "The only other letters by Mrs. Newton are written on paper of a\ndifferent and more modern size; they leave an impression of having\nbeen written a good many years later.  I take them as they come.\nThe first is very short:-",
        "“DEAR Miss —, i write to say i cannot possiblely come on Wednesday\nas we have killed a pig.  your’s truely,",
        "“ELIZABETH NEWTON.”",
        "The second runs:-",
        "“DEAR Miss —, i hope you are both quite well in health & your Leg\nmuch better i am happy to say i am getting quite well again i hope\nAmandy has reached you safe by this time i sent a small parcle by\nAmandy, there was half a dozen Pats of butter & the Cakes was very\nhomely and not so light as i could wish i hope by this time Sarah\nAnn has promised she will stay untill next monday as i think a few\ndaies longer will not make much diferance and as her young man has\nbeen very considerate to wait so long as he has i think he would for\na few days Longer dear Miss — I wash for William and i have not got\nhis clothes yet as it has been delayed by the carrier & i cannot\npossiblely get it done before Sunday and i do not Like traviling on\na Sunday but to oblige you i would come but to come sooner i cannot\npossiblely but i hope Sarah Ann will be prevailed on once more as\nShe has so many times i feel sure if she tells her young man he will\nhave patient for he is a very kind young man",
        "“i remain your sincerely",
        "“ELIZABETH NEWTON.”",
        "The last letter in my collection seems written almost within\nmeasurable distance of the Christmas-card era.  The sheet is headed\nby a beautifully embossed device of some holly in red and green,\nwishing the recipient of the letter a merry Xmas and a happy new\nyear, while the border is crimped and edged with blue.  I know not\nwhat it is, but there is something in the writer’s highly finished\nstyle that reminds me of Mendelssohn.  It would almost do for the\nwords of one of his celebrated “Lieder ohne Worte”:",
        "“DEAR MISS MARIA,—I hasten to acknowledge the receipt of your kind\nnote with the inclosure for which I return my best thanks.  I need\nscarcely say how glad I was to know that the volumes secured your\napproval, and that the announcement of the improvement in the\ncondition of your Sister’s legs afforded me infinite pleasure.  The\ngratifying news encouraged me in the hope that now the nature of the\ndisorder is comprehended her legs will—notwithstanding the process\nmay be gradual—ultimately get quite well.  The pretty Robin\nRedbreast which lay ensconced in your epistle, conveyed to me, in\nterms more eloquent than words, how much you desired me those\nCompliments which the little missive he bore in his bill expressed;\nthe emblem is sweetly pretty, and now that we are again allowed to\nfelicitate each other on another recurrence of the season of the\nChristian’s rejoicing, permit me to tender to yourself, and by you\nto your Sister, mine and my Wife’s heartfelt congratulations and\nwarmest wishes with respect to the coming year.  It is a common\nbelief that if we take a retrospective view of each departing year,\nas it behoves us annually to do, we shall find the blessings which\nwe have received to immeasurably outnumber our causes of sorrow.\nSpeaking for myself I can fully subscribe to that sentiment, and\ndoubtless neither Miss — nor yourself are exceptions.  Miss —’s\nillness and consequent confinement to the house has been a severe\ntrial, but in that trouble an opportunity was afforded you to prove\na Sister’s devotion and she has been enabled to realise a larger (if\npossible) display of sisterly affection.",
        "“A happy Christmas to you both, and may the new year prove a\nCornucopia from which still greater blessings than even those we\nhave hitherto received, shall issue, to benefit us all by\ncontributing to our temporal happiness and, what is of higher\nimportance, conducing to our felicity hereafter.",
        "“I was sorry to hear that you were so annoyed with mice and rats,\nand if I should have an opportunity to obtain a nice cat I will do\nso and send my boy to your house with it.",
        "“I remain,\n“Yours truly.”",
        "How little what is commonly called education can do after all\ntowards the formation of a good style, and what a delightful volume\nmight not be entitled “Half Hours with the Worst Authors.”  Why, the\nfinest word I know of in the English language was coined, not by my\npoor old grandfather, whose education had left little to desire, nor\nby any of the admirable scholars whom he in his turn educated, but\nby an old matron who presided over one of the halls, or houses of\nhis school.",
        "This good lady, whose name by the way was Bromfield, had a fine high\ntemper of her own, or thought it politic to affect one.  One night\nwhen the boys were particularly noisy she burst like a hurricane\ninto the hall, collared a youngster, and told him he was “the ramp-\ningest-scampingest-rackety-tackety-tow-row-roaringest boy in the\nwhole school.”  Would Mrs. Newton have been able to set the aunt and\nthe dog before us so vividly if she had been more highly educated?\nWould Mrs. Bromfield have been able to forge and hurl her\nthunderbolt of a word if she had been taught how to do so, or indeed\nbeen at much pains to create it at all?  It came.  It was her [Greek\ntext].  She did not probably know that she had done what the\ngreatest scholar would have had to rack his brains over for many an\nhour before he could even approach.  Tradition says that having\nbrought down her boy she looked round the hall in triumph, and then\nafter a moment’s lull said, “Young gentlemen, prayers are excused,\"\nand left them.",
        "I have sometimes thought that, after all, the main use of a\nclassical education consists in the check it gives to originality,\nand the way in which it prevents an inconvenient number of people\nfrom using their own eyes.  That we will not be at the trouble of\nlooking at things for ourselves if we can get any one to tell us\nwhat we ought to see goes without saying, and it is the business of\nschools and universities to assist us in this respect.  The theory\nof evolution teaches that any power not worked at pretty high\npressure will deteriorate:  originality and freedom from affectation\nare all very well in their way, but we can easily have too much of\nthem, and it is better that none should be either original or free\nfrom cant but those who insist on being so, no matter what\nhindrances obstruct, nor what incentives are offered them to see\nthings through the regulation medium.",
        "To insist on seeing things for oneself is to be in [Greek text], or\nin plain English, an idiot; nor do I see any safer check against\ngeneral vigour and clearness of thought, with consequent terseness\nof expression, than that provided by the curricula of our\nuniversities and schools of public instruction.  If a young man, in\nspite of every effort to fit him with blinkers, will insist on\ngetting rid of them, he must do so at his own risk.  He will not be\nlong in finding out his mistake.  Our public schools and\nuniversities play the beneficent part in our social scheme that\ncattle do in forests:  they browse the seedlings down and prevent\nthe growth of all but the luckiest and sturdiest.  Of course, if\nthere are too many either cattle or schools, they browse so\neffectually that they find no more food, and starve till equilibrium\nis restored; but it seems to be a provision of nature that there\nshould always be these alternate periods, during which either the\ncattle or the trees are getting the best of it; and, indeed, without\nsuch provision we should have neither the one nor the other.  At\nthis moment the cattle, doubtless, are in the ascendant, and if\nuniversity extension proceeds much farther, we shall assuredly have\nno more Mrs. Newtons and Mrs. Bromfields; but whatever is is best,\nand, on the whole, I should propose to let things find pretty much\ntheir own level.",
        "However this may be, who can question that the treasures hidden in\nmany a country house contain sleeping beauties even fairer than\nthose that I have endeavoured to waken from long sleep in the\nforegoing article?  How many Mrs. Quicklys are there not living in\nLondon at this present moment?  For that Mrs. Quickly was an\ninvention of Shakespeare’s I will not believe.  The old woman from\nwhom he drew said every word that he put into Mrs. Quickly’s mouth,\nand a great deal more which he did not and perhaps could not make\nuse of.  This question, however, would again lead me far from my\nsubject, which I should mar were I to dwell upon it longer, and\ntherefore leave with the hope that it may give my readers absolutely\nno food whatever for reflection.",
