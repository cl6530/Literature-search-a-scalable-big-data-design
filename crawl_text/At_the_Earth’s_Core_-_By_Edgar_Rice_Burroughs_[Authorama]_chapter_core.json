        "In the first place please bear in mind that I do not\nexpect you to believe this story. Nor could you wonder\nhad you witnessed a recent experience of mine when,\nin the armor of blissful and stupendous ignorance,\nI gaily narrated the gist of it to a Fellow of the Royal\nGeological Society on the occasion of my last trip to London.",
        "You would surely have thought that I had been detected\nin no less a heinous crime than the purloining of the Crown\nJewels from the Tower, or putting poison in the coffee\nof His Majesty the King.",
        "The erudite gentleman in whom I confided congealed\nbefore I was half through!—it is all that saved him\nfrom exploding—and my dreams of an Honorary Fellowship,\ngold medals, and a niche in the Hall of Fame faded into\nthe thin, cold air of his arctic atmosphere.",
        "But I believe the story, and so would you, and so would\nthe learned Fellow of the Royal Geological Society, had you\nand he heard it from the lips of the man who told it to me.\nHad you seen, as I did, the fire of truth in those gray eyes;\nhad you felt the ring of sincerity in that quiet voice;\nhad you realized the pathos of it all—you, too, would believe.\nYou would not have needed the final ocular proof that I\nhad—the weird rhamphorhynchus-like creature which he\nhad brought back with him from the inner world.",
        "I came upon him quite suddenly, and no less unexpectedly,\nupon the rim of the great Sahara Desert. He was standing\nbefore a goat-skin tent amidst a clump of date palms within\na tiny oasis. Close by was an Arab douar of some eight\nor ten tents.",
        "I had come down from the north to hunt lion. My party\nconsisted of a dozen children of the desert—I was the only\n\"white” man. As we approached the little clump of verdure\nI saw the man come from his tent and with hand-shaded eyes\npeer intently at us. At sight of me he advanced rapidly\nto meet us.",
        "“A white man!” he cried. “May the good Lord be praised! I\nhave been watching you for hours, hoping against hope that\nTHIS time there would be a white man. Tell me the date.\nWhat year is it?”",
        "And when I had told him he staggered as though he had\nbeen struck full in the face, so that he was compelled\nto grasp my stirrup leather for support.",
        "“It cannot be!” he cried after a moment. “It cannot be!\nTell me that you are mistaken, or that you are but joking.”",
        "“I am telling you the truth, my friend,” I replied.\n\"Why should I deceive a stranger, or attempt to, in so\nsimple a matter as the date?”",
        "For some time he stood in silence, with bowed head.",
        "“Ten years!” he murmured, at last. “Ten years, and I\nthought that at the most it could be scarce more than one!\"\nThat night he told me his story—the story that I give you\nhere as nearly in his own words as I can recall them.",
        "I was born in Connecticut about thirty years ago.\nMy name is David Innes. My father was a wealthy mine owner.\nWhen I was nineteen he died. All his property was to be\nmine when I had attained my majority—provided that I\nhad devoted the two years intervening in close application\nto the great business I was to inherit.",
        "I did my best to fulfil the last wishes of my parent—\nnot because of the inheritance, but because I loved\nand honored my father. For six months I toiled in the\nmines and in the counting-rooms, for I wished to know\nevery minute detail of the business.",
        "Then Perry interested me in his invention. He was an old\nfellow who had devoted the better part of a long life\nto the perfection of a mechanical subterranean prospector.\nAs relaxation he studied paleontology. I looked over\nhis plans, listened to his arguments, inspected his working\nmodel—and then, convinced, I advanced the funds necessary\nto construct a full-sized, practical prospector.",
        "I shall not go into the details of its construction—it lies\nout there in the desert now—about two miles from here.\nTomorrow you may care to ride out and see it. Roughly, it is\na steel cylinder a hundred feet long, and jointed so that\nit may turn and twist through solid rock if need be.\nAt one end is a mighty revolving drill operated by an\nengine which Perry said generated more power to the cubic\ninch than any other engine did to the cubic foot.\nI remember that he used to claim that that invention\nalone would make us fabulously wealthy—we were going\nto make the whole thing public after the successful issue\nof our first secret trial—but Perry never returned\nfrom that trial trip, and I only after ten years.",
        "I recall as it were but yesterday the night of that momentous\noccasion upon which we were to test the practicality\nof that wondrous invention. It was near midnight when we\nrepaired to the lofty tower in which Perry had constructed\nhis “iron mole” as he was wont to call the thing.\nThe great nose rested upon the bare earth of the floor.\nWe passed through the doors into the outer jacket,\nsecured them, and then passing on into the cabin,\nwhich contained the controlling mechanism within the\ninner tube, switched on the electric lights.",
        "Perry looked to his generator; to the great tanks that held\nthe life-giving chemicals with which he was to manufacture\nfresh air to replace that which we consumed in breathing;\nto his instruments for recording temperatures, speed, distance,\nand for examining the materials through which we were to pass.",
        "He tested the steering device, and overlooked the mighty\ncogs which transmitted its marvelous velocity to the giant\ndrill at the nose of his strange craft.",
        "Our seats, into which we strapped ourselves, were so arranged\nupon transverse bars that we would be upright whether\nthe craft were ploughing her way downward into the bowels\nof the earth, or running horizontally along some great\nseam of coal, or rising vertically toward the surface again.",
        "At length all was ready. Perry bowed his head in prayer.\nFor a moment we were silent, and then the old man’s hand\ngrasped the starting lever. There was a frightful roaring\nbeneath us—the giant frame trembled and vibrated—there\nwas a rush of sound as the loose earth passed up through\nthe hollow space between the inner and outer jackets\nto be deposited in our wake. We were off!",
        "The noise was deafening. The sensation was frightful.\nFor a full minute neither of us could do aught but cling\nwith the proverbial desperation of the drowning man to\nthe handrails of our swinging seats. Then Perry glanced\nat the thermometer.",
        "“Gad!” he cried, “it cannot be possible—quick! What does\nthe distance meter read?”",
        "That and the speedometer were both on my side of the cabin,\nand as I turned to take a reading from the former I could\nsee Perry muttering.",
        "“Ten degrees rise—it cannot be possible!” and then I\nsaw him tug frantically upon the steering wheel.",
        "As I finally found the tiny needle in the dim light I\ntranslated Perry’s evident excitement, and my heart\nsank within me. But when I spoke I hid the fear which\nhaunted me. “It will be seven hundred feet, Perry,” I said,\n\"by the time you can turn her into the horizontal.”",
        "“You’d better lend me a hand then, my boy,” he replied,\n\"for I cannot budge her out of the vertical alone.\nGod give that our combined strength may be equal to the task,\nfor else we are lost.”",
        "I wormed my way to the old man’s side with never a doubt\nbut that the great wheel would yield on the instant\nto the power of my young and vigorous muscles. Nor was\nmy belief mere vanity, for always had my physique been\nthe envy and despair of my fellows. And for that very\nreason it had waxed even greater than nature had intended,\nsince my natural pride in my great strength had led me\nto care for and develop my body and my muscles by every\nmeans within my power. What with boxing, football,\nand baseball, I had been in training since childhood.",
        "And so it was with the utmost confidence that I laid hold\nof the huge iron rim; but though I threw every ounce of my\nstrength into it, my best effort was as unavailing as Perry’s\nhad been—the thing would not budge—the grim, insensate,\nhorrible thing that was holding us upon the straight\nroad to death!",
        "At length I gave up the useless struggle, and without a word\nreturned to my seat. There was no need for words—at least\nnone that I could imagine, unless Perry desired to pray.\nAnd I was quite sure that he would, for he never left an\nopportunity neglected where he might sandwich in a prayer.\nHe prayed when he arose in the morning, he prayed\nbefore he ate, he prayed when he had finished eating,\nand before he went to bed at night he prayed again.\nIn between he often found excuses to pray even when the\nprovocation seemed far-fetched to my worldly eyes—now\nthat he was about to die I felt positive that I should\nwitness a perfect orgy of prayer—if one may allude\nwith such a simile to so solemn an act.",
        "But to my astonishment I discovered that with death staring\nhim in the face Abner Perry was transformed into a new being.\nFrom his lips there flowed—not prayer—but a clear and limpid\nstream of undiluted profanity, and it was all directed\nat that quietly stubborn piece of unyielding mechanism.",
        "“I should think, Perry,” I chided, “that a man of your\nprofessed religiousness would rather be at his prayers\nthan cursing in the presence of imminent death.”",
        "“Death!” he cried. “Death is it that appalls you?\nThat is nothing by comparison with the loss the world\nmust suffer. Why, David within this iron cylinder we have\ndemonstrated possibilities that science has scarce dreamed.\nWe have harnessed a new principle, and with it animated\na piece of steel with the power of ten thousand men.\nThat two lives will be snuffed out is nothing to the world\ncalamity that entombs in the bowels of the earth the\ndiscoveries that I have made and proved in the successful\nconstruction of the thing that is now carrying us farther\nand farther toward the eternal central fires.”",
        "I am frank to admit that for myself I was much more\nconcerned with our own immediate future than with any\nproblematic loss which the world might be about to suffer.\nThe world was at least ignorant of its bereavement,\nwhile to me it was a real and terrible actuality.",
        "“What can we do?” I asked, hiding my perturbation beneath\nthe mask of a low and level voice.",
        "“We may stop here, and die of asphyxiation when our atmosphere\ntanks are empty,” replied Perry, “or we may continue\non with the slight hope that we may later sufficiently\ndeflect the prospector from the vertical to carry us along\nthe arc of a great circle which must eventually return us\nto the surface. If we succeed in so doing before we reach\nthe higher internal temperature we may even yet survive.\nThere would seem to me to be about one chance in several\nmillion that we shall succeed—otherwise we shall die\nmore quickly but no more surely than as though we sat\nsupinely waiting for the torture of a slow and horrible death.”",
        "I glanced at the thermometer. It registered 110 degrees.\nWhile we were talking the mighty iron mole had bored its way\nover a mile into the rock of the earth’s crust.",
        "“Let us continue on, then,” I replied. “It should soon\nbe over at this rate. You never intimated that the speed\nof this thing would be so high, Perry. Didn’t you know it?”",
        "“No,” he answered. “I could not figure the speed exactly,\nfor I had no instrument for measuring the mighty power\nof my generator. I reasoned, however, that we should make\nabout five hundred yards an hour.”",
        "“And we are making seven miles an hour,” I concluded\nfor him, as I sat with my eyes upon the distance meter.\n\"How thick is the Earth’s crust, Perry?” I asked.",
        "“There are almost as many conjectures as to that as there\nare geologists,” was his answer. “One estimates it\nthirty miles, because the internal heat, increasing at\nthe rate of about one degree to each sixty to seventy\nfeet depth, would be sufficient to fuse the most refractory\nsubstances at that distance beneath the surface.\nAnother finds that the phenomena of precession and\nnutation require that the earth, if not entirely solid,\nmust at least have a shell not less than eight hundred\nto a thousand miles in thickness. So there you are.\nYou may take your choice.”",
        "“And if it should prove solid?” I asked.",
        "“It will be all the same to us in the end, David,\"\nreplied Perry. “At the best our fuel will suffice to carry\nus but three or four days, while our atmosphere cannot\nlast to exceed three. Neither, then, is sufficient to bear\nus in the safety through eight thousand miles of rock to\nthe antipodes.”",
        "“If the crust is of sufficient thickness we shall come\nto a final stop between six and seven hundred miles\nbeneath the earth’s surface; but during the last hundred\nand fifty miles of our journey we shall be corpses.\nAm I correct?” I asked.",
        "“Quite correct, David. Are you frightened?”",
        "“I do not know. It all has come so suddenly that I scarce\nbelieve that either of us realizes the real terrors of\nour position. I feel that I should be reduced to panic;\nbut yet I am not. I imagine that the shock has been\nso great as to partially stun our sensibilities.”",
        "Again I turned to the thermometer. The mercury was\nrising with less rapidity. It was now but 140 degrees,\nalthough we had penetrated to a depth of nearly four miles.\nI told Perry, and he smiled.",
        "“We have shattered one theory at least,” was his\nonly comment, and then he returned to his self-assumed\noccupation of fluently cursing the steering wheel.\nI once heard a pirate swear, but his best efforts would\nhave seemed like those of a tyro alongside of Perry’s\nmasterful and scientific imprecations.",
        "Once more I tried my hand at the wheel, but I might\nas well have essayed to swing the earth itself. At my\nsuggestion Perry stopped the generator, and as we came\nto rest I again threw all my strength into a supreme effort\nto move the thing even a hair’s breadth—but the results\nwere as barren as when we had been traveling at top speed.",
        "I shook my head sadly, and motioned to the starting lever.\nPerry pulled it toward him, and once again we were plunging\ndownward toward eternity at the rate of seven miles an hour.\nI sat with my eyes glued to the thermometer and the\ndistance meter. The mercury was rising very slowly now,\nthough even at 145 degrees it was almost unbearable within\nthe narrow confines of our metal prison.",
        "About noon, or twelve hours after our start upon this\nunfortunate journey, we had bored to a depth of eighty-four\nmiles, at which point the mercury registered 153 degrees F.",
        "Perry was becoming more hopeful, although upon what meager\nfood he sustained his optimism I could not conjecture.\nFrom cursing he had turned to singing—I felt that the\nstrain had at last affected his mind. For several hours\nwe had not spoken except as he asked me for the readings\nof the instruments from time to time, and I announced them.\nMy thoughts were filled with vain regrets. I recalled\nnumerous acts of my past life which I should have been glad\nto have had a few more years to live down. There was the\naffair in the Latin Commons at Andover when Calhoun and I\nhad put gunpowder in the stove—and nearly killed one of\nthe masters. And then—but what was the use, I was about\nto die and atone for all these things and several more.\nAlready the heat was sufficient to give me a foretaste\nof the hereafter. A few more degrees and I felt that I\nshould lose consciousness.",
        "“What are the readings now, David?” Perry’s voice broke\nin upon my somber reflections.",
        "“Ninety miles and 153 degrees,” I replied.",
        "“Gad, but we’ve knocked that thirty-mile-crust theory\ninto a cocked hat!” he cried gleefully.",
        "“Precious lot of good it will do us,” I growled back.",
        "“But my boy,” he continued, “doesn’t that temperature reading\nmean anything to you? Why it hasn’t gone up in six miles.\nThink of it, son!”",
        "“Yes, I’m thinking of it,” I answered; “but what difference\nwill it make when our air supply is exhausted whether\nthe temperature is 153 degrees or 153,000? We’ll be just\nas dead, and no one will know the difference, anyhow.\"\nBut I must admit that for some unaccountable reason\nthe stationary temperature did renew my waning hope.\nWhat I hoped for I could not have explained, nor did\nI try. The very fact, as Perry took pains to explain,\nof the blasting of several very exact and learned\nscientific hypotheses made it apparent that we could not\nknow what lay before us within the bowels of the earth,\nand so we might continue to hope for the best, at least\nuntil we were dead—when hope would no longer be essential\nto our happiness. It was very good, and logical reasoning,\nand so I embraced it.",
        "At one hundred miles the temperature had DROPPED TO 152 1/2\nDEGREES! When I announced it Perry reached over and hugged me.",
        "From then on until noon of the second day, it continued\nto drop until it became as uncomfortably cold as it had\nbeen unbearably hot before. At the depth of two hundred\nand forty miles our nostrils were assailed by almost\noverpowering ammonia fumes, and the temperature had dropped\nto TEN BELOW ZERO! We suffered nearly two hours of this\nintense and bitter cold, until at about two hundred\nand forty-five miles from the surface of the earth we\nentered a stratum of solid ice, when the mercury quickly\nrose to 32 degrees. During the next three hours we\npassed through ten miles of ice, eventually emerging\ninto another series of ammonia-impregnated strata,\nwhere the mercury again fell to ten degrees below zero.",
        "Slowly it rose once more until we were convinced that at\nlast we were nearing the molten interior of the earth.\nAt four hundred miles the temperature had reached 153 degrees.\nFeverishly I watched the thermometer. Slowly it rose.\nPerry had ceased singing and was at last praying.",
        "Our hopes had received such a deathblow that the gradually\nincreasing heat seemed to our distorted imaginations\nmuch greater than it really was. For another hour I\nsaw that pitiless column of mercury rise and rise until\nat four hundred and ten miles it stood at 153 degrees.\nNow it was that we began to hang upon those readings\nin almost breathless anxiety.",
        "One hundred and fifty-three degrees had been the maximum\ntemperature above the ice stratum. Would it stop at this\npoint again, or would it continue its merciless climb? We\nknew that there was no hope, and yet with the persistence\nof life itself we continued to hope against practical certainty.",
        "Already the air tanks were at low ebb—there was barely\nenough of the precious gases to sustain us for another\ntwelve hours. But would we be alive to know or care?\nIt seemed incredible.",
        "At four hundred and twenty miles I took another reading.",
        "“Perry!” I shouted. “Perry, man! She’s going down! She’s\ngoing down! She’s 152 degrees again.”",
        "“Gad!” he cried. “What can it mean? Can the earth\nbe cold at the center?”",
        "“I do not know, Perry,” I answered; “but thank God,\nif I am to die it shall not be by fire—that is all that I\nhave feared. I can face the thought of any death but that.”",
        "Down, down went the mercury until it stood as low as it\nhad seven miles from the surface of the earth, and then\nof a sudden the realization broke upon us that death was\nvery near. Perry was the first to discover it. I saw him\nfussing with the valves that regulate the air supply.\nAnd at the same time I experienced difficulty in breathing.\nMy head felt dizzy—my limbs heavy.",
        "I saw Perry crumple in his seat. He gave himself a shake\nand sat erect again. Then he turned toward me.",
        "“Good-bye, David,” he said. “I guess this is the end,\"\nand then he smiled and closed his eyes.",
        "“Good-bye, Perry, and good luck to you,” I answered,\nsmiling back at him. But I fought off that awful lethargy.\nI was very young—I did not want to die.",
        "For an hour I battled against the cruelly enveloping\ndeath that surrounded me upon all sides. At first I\nfound that by climbing high into the framework above me\nI could find more of the precious life-giving elements,\nand for a while these sustained me. It must have been\nan hour after Perry had succumbed that I at last came\nto the realization that I could no longer carry on this\nunequal struggle against the inevitable.",
        "With my last flickering ray of consciousness I turned\nmechanically toward the distance meter. It stood at exactly\nfive hundred miles from the earth’s surface—and then\nof a sudden the huge thing that bore us came to a stop.\nThe rattle of hurtling rock through the hollow jacket ceased.\nThe wild racing of the giant drill betokened that it\nwas running loose in AIR—and then another truth flashed\nupon me. The point of the prospector was ABOVE us.\nSlowly it dawned on me that since passing through the ice\nstrata it had been above. We had turned in the ice\nand sped upward toward the earth’s crust. Thank God! We\nwere safe!",
        "I put my nose to the intake pipe through which samples were\nto have been taken during the passage of the prospector\nthrough the earth, and my fondest hopes were realized—a\nflood of fresh air was pouring into the iron cabin.\nThe reaction left me in a state of collapse, and I\nlost consciousness.",
        "I was unconscious little more than an instant,\nfor as I lunged forward from the crossbeam to which I\nhad been clinging, and fell with a crash to the floor\nof the cabin, the shock brought me to myself.",
        "My first concern was with Perry. I was horrified at the thought\nthat upon the very threshold of salvation he might be dead.\nTearing open his shirt I placed my ear to his breast.\nI could have cried with relief—his heart was beating\nquite regularly.",
        "At the water tank I wetted my handkerchief, slapping it\nsmartly across his forehead and face several times.\nIn a moment I was rewarded by the raising of his lids.\nFor a time he lay wide-eyed and quite uncomprehending.\nThen his scattered wits slowly foregathered, and he sat\nup sniffing the air with an expression of wonderment upon\nhis face.",
        "“Why, David,” he cried at last, “it’s air, as sure as I live.\nWhy—why what does it mean? Where in the world are we?\nWhat has happened?”",
        "“It means that we’re back at the surface all right, Perry,” I cried;\n\"but where, I don’t know. I haven’t opened her up yet.\nBeen too busy reviving you. Lord, man, but you had a close squeak!”",
        "“You say we’re back at the surface, David? How can\nthat be? How long have I been unconscious?”",
        "“Not long. We turned in the ice stratum.\nDon’t you recall the sudden whirling of our seats?\nAfter that the drill was above you instead of below.\nWe didn’t notice it at the time; but I recall it now.”",
        "“You mean to say that we turned back in the ice stratum,\nDavid? That is not possible. The prospector cannot turn\nunless its nose is deflected from the outside—by some\nexternal force or resistance—the steering wheel within\nwould have moved in response. The steering wheel has\nnot budged, David, since we started. You know that.”",
        "I did know it; but here we were with our drill racing in\npure air, and copious volumes of it pouring into the cabin.",
        "“We couldn’t have turned in the ice stratum, Perry, I know\nas well as you,” I replied; “but the fact remains\nthat we did, for here we are this minute at the surface\nof the earth again, and I am going out to see just where.”",
        "“Better wait till morning, David—it must be midnight now.”",
        "I glanced at the chronometer.",
        "“Half after twelve. We have been out seventy-two hours,\nso it must be midnight. Nevertheless I am going to have\na look at the blessed sky that I had given up all hope\nof ever seeing again,” and so saying I lifted the bars\nfrom the inner door, and swung it open. There was quite\na quantity of loose material in the jacket, and this I\nhad to remove with a shovel to get at the opposite door\nin the outer shell.",
        "In a short time I had removed enough of the earth and rock\nto the floor of the cabin to expose the door beyond.\nPerry was directly behind me as I threw it open.\nThe upper half was above the surface of the ground.\nWith an expression of surprise I turned and looked at\nPerry—it was broad daylight without!",
        "“Something seems to have gone wrong either with our\ncalculations or the chronometer,” I said. Perry shook\nhis head—there was a strange expression in his eyes.",
        "“Let’s have a look beyond that door, David,” he cried.",
        "Together we stepped out to stand in silent contemplation\nof a landscape at once weird and beautiful. Before us\na low and level shore stretched down to a silent sea.\nAs far as the eye could reach the surface of the water\nwas dotted with countless tiny isles—some of towering,\nbarren, granitic rock—others resplendent in gorgeous\ntrappings of tropical vegetation, myriad starred with\nthe magnificent splendor of vivid blooms.",
        "Behind us rose a dark and forbidding wood of giant\narborescent ferns intermingled with the commoner types\nof a primeval tropical forest. Huge creepers depended\nin great loops from tree to tree, dense under-brush\novergrew a tangled mass of fallen trunks and branches.\nUpon the outer verge we could see the same splendid\ncoloring of countless blossoms that glorified the islands,\nbut within the dense shadows all seemed dark and gloomy\nas the grave.",
        "And upon all the noonday sun poured its torrid rays\nout of a cloudless sky.",
        "“Where on earth can we be?” I asked, turning to Perry.",
        "For some moments the old man did not reply. He stood\nwith bowed head, buried in deep thought. But at last\nhe spoke.",
        "“David,” he said, “I am not so sure that we are ON earth.”",
        "“What do you mean Perry?” I cried. “Do you think that we\nare dead, and this is heaven?” He smiled, and turning,\npointing to the nose of the prospector protruding from\nthe ground at our backs.",
        "“But for that, David, I might believe that we were indeed\ncome to the country beyond the Styx. The prospector\nrenders that theory untenable—it, certainly, could never\nhave gone to heaven. However I am willing to concede\nthat we actually may be in another world from that\nwhich we have always known. If we are not ON earth,\nthere is every reason to believe that we may be IN it.”",
        "“We may have quartered through the earth’s crust and come\nout upon some tropical island of the West Indies,\"\nI suggested. Again Perry shook his head.",
        "“Let us wait and see, David,” he replied, “and in the\nmeantime suppose we do a bit of exploring up and down\nthe coast—we may find a native who can enlighten us.”",
        "As we walked along the beach Perry gazed long and\nearnestly across the water. Evidently he was wrestling\nwith a mighty problem.",
        "“David,” he said abruptly, “do you perceive anything\nunusual about the horizon?”",
        "As I looked I began to appreciate the reason for the\nstrangeness of the landscape that had haunted me from\nthe first with an illusive suggestion of the bizarre\nand unnatural—THERE WAS NO HORIZON! As far as the eye\ncould reach out the sea continued and upon its bosom\nfloated tiny islands, those in the distance reduced\nto mere specks; but ever beyond them was the sea,\nuntil the impression became quite real that one was\nLOOKING UP at the most distant point that the eyes\ncould fathom—the distance was lost in the distance.\nThat was all—there was no clear-cut horizontal\nline marking the dip of the globe below the line of vision.",
        "“A great light is commencing to break on me,” continued Perry,\ntaking out his watch. “I believe that I have partially\nsolved the riddle. It is now two o’clock. When we emerged\nfrom the prospector the sun was directly above us.\nWhere is it now?”",
        "I glanced up to find the great orb still motionless\nin the center of the heaven. And such a sun! I had\nscarcely noticed it before. Fully thrice the size of\nthe sun I had known throughout my life, and apparently\nso near that the sight of it carried the conviction\nthat one might almost reach up and touch it.",
        "“My God, Perry, where are we?” I exclaimed. “This thing\nis beginning to get on my nerves.”",
        "“I think that I may state quite positively, David,\"\nhe commenced, “that we are—” but he got no further.\nFrom behind us in the vicinity of the prospector there\ncame the most thunderous, awe-inspiring roar that ever\nhad fallen upon my ears. With one accord we turned\nto discover the author of that fearsome noise.",
        "Had I still retained the suspicion that we were on earth the\nsight that met my eyes would quite entirely have banished it.\nEmerging from the forest was a colossal beast which closely\nresembled a bear. It was fully as large as the largest\nelephant and with great forepaws armed with huge claws.\nIts nose, or snout, depended nearly a foot below its\nlower jaw, much after the manner of a rudimentary trunk.\nThe giant body was covered by a coat of thick, shaggy hair.",
        "Roaring horribly it came toward us at a ponderous,\nshuffling trot. I turned to Perry to suggest that it\nmight be wise to seek other surroundings—the idea had\nevidently occurred to Perry previously, for he was already\na hundred paces away, and with each second his prodigious\nbounds increased the distance. I had never guessed\nwhat latent speed possibilities the old gentleman possessed.",
        "I saw that he was headed toward a little point of the\nforest which ran out toward the sea not far from where we\nhad been standing, and as the mighty creature, the sight\nof which had galvanized him into such remarkable action,\nwas forging steadily toward me. I set off after Perry,\nthough at a somewhat more decorous pace. It was evident\nthat the massive beast pursuing us was not built for speed,\nso all that I considered necessary was to gain the trees\nsufficiently ahead of it to enable me to climb to the safety\nof some great branch before it came up.",
        "Notwithstanding our danger I could not help but laugh at\nPerry’s frantic capers as he essayed to gain the safety\nof the lower branches of the trees he now had reached.\nThe stems were bare for a distance of some fifteen feet—at\nleast on those trees which Perry attempted to ascend,\nfor the suggestion of safety carried by the larger of\nthe forest giants had evidently attracted him to them.\nA dozen times he scrambled up the trunks like a huge cat\nonly to fall back to the ground once more, and with each\nfailure he cast a horrified glance over his shoulder at\nthe oncoming brute, simultaneously emitting terror-stricken\nshrieks that awoke the echoes of the grim forest.",
        "At length he spied a dangling creeper about the bigness\nof one’s wrist, and when I reached the trees he was racing\nmadly up it, hand over hand. He had almost reached the lowest\nbranch of the tree from which the creeper depended when\nthe thing parted beneath his weight and he fell sprawling\nat my feet.",
        "The misfortune now was no longer amusing, for the beast\nwas already too close to us for comfort. Seizing Perry\nby the shoulder I dragged him to his feet, and rushing\nto a smaller tree—one that he could easily encircle with\nhis arms and legs—I boosted him as far up as I could,\nand then left him to his fate, for a glance over my\nshoulder revealed the awful beast almost upon me.",
        "It was the great size of the thing alone that saved me.\nIts enormous bulk rendered it too slow upon its feet\nto cope with the agility of my young muscles, and so I was\nenabled to dodge out of its way and run completely behind\nit before its slow wits could direct it in pursuit.",
        "The few seconds of grace that this gave me found me\nsafely lodged in the branches of a tree a few paces\nfrom that in which Perry had at last found a haven.",
        "Did I say safely lodged? At the time I thought we were\nquite safe, and so did Perry. He was praying—raising\nhis voice in thanksgiving at our deliverance—and had\njust completed a sort of paeon of gratitude that the thing\ncouldn’t climb a tree when without warning it reared up\nbeneath him on its enormous tail and hind feet, and reached\nthose fearfully armed paws quite to the branch upon\nwhich he crouched.",
        "The accompanying roar was all but drowned in Perry’s\nscream of fright, and he came near tumbling headlong\ninto the gaping jaws beneath him, so precipitate was\nhis impetuous haste to vacate the dangerous limb.\nIt was with a deep sigh of relief that I saw him gain\na higher branch in safety.",
        "And then the brute did that which froze us both anew\nwith horror. Grasping the tree’s stem with his powerful\npaws he dragged down with all the great weight of his\nhuge bulk and all the irresistible force of those\nmighty muscles. Slowly, but surely, the stem began to\nbend toward him. Inch by inch he worked his paws upward\nas the tree leaned more and more from the perpendicular.\nPerry clung chattering in a panic of terror. Higher and\nhigher into the bending and swaying tree he clambered.\nMore and more rapidly was the tree top inclining toward\nthe ground.",
        "I saw now why the great brute was armed with such\nenormous paws. The use that he was putting them to was\nprecisely that for which nature had intended them.\nThe sloth-like creature was herbivorous, and to feed that mighty\ncarcass entire trees must be stripped of their foliage.\nThe reason for its attacking us might easily be accounted\nfor on the supposition of an ugly disposition such as that\nwhich the fierce and stupid rhinoceros of Africa possesses.\nBut these were later reflections. At the moment I was too\nfrantic with apprehension on Perry’s behalf to consider aught\nother than a means to save him from the death that loomed so close.",
        "Realizing that I could outdistance the clumsy brute in\nthe open, I dropped from my leafy sanctuary intent only on\ndistracting the thing’s attention from Perry long enough\nto enable the old man to gain the safety of a larger tree.\nThere were many close by which not even the terrific\nstrength of that titanic monster could bend.",
        "As I touched the ground I snatched a broken limb from\nthe tangled mass that matted the jungle-like floor of the\nforest and, leaping unnoticed behind the shaggy back,\ndealt the brute a terrific blow. My plan worked like magic.\nFrom the previous slowness of the beast I had been led\nto look for no such marvelous agility as he now displayed.\nReleasing his hold upon the tree he dropped on all fours\nand at the same time swung his great, wicked tail with a\nforce that would have broken every bone in my body had it\nstruck me; but, fortunately, I had turned to flee at the\nvery instant that I felt my blow land upon the towering back.",
        "As it started in pursuit of me I made the mistake of running\nalong the edge of the forest rather than making for the\nopen beach. In a moment I was knee-deep in rotting vegetation,\nand the awful thing behind me was gaining rapidly\nas I floundered and fell in my efforts to extricate myself.",
        "A fallen log gave me an instant’s advantage, for climbing\nupon it I leaped to another a few paces farther on,\nand in this way was able to keep clear of the mush that\ncarpeted the surrounding ground. But the zigzag course\nthat this necessitated was placing such a heavy handicap\nupon me that my pursuer was steadily gaining upon me.",
        "Suddenly from behind I heard a tumult of howls, and sharp,\npiercing barks—much the sound that a pack of wolves\nraises when in full cry. Involuntarily I glanced\nbackward to discover the origin of this new and menacing\nnote with the result that I missed my footing and went\nsprawling once more upon my face in the deep muck.",
        "My mammoth enemy was so close by this time that I knew I\nmust feel the weight of one of his terrible paws before I\ncould rise, but to my surprise the blow did not fall upon me.\nThe howling and snapping and barking of the new element\nwhich had been infused into the melee now seemed centered\nquite close behind me, and as I raised myself upon my hands\nand glanced around I saw what it was that had distracted\nthe DYRYTH, as I afterward learned the thing is called,\nfrom my trail.",
        "It was surrounded by a pack of some hundred wolf-like\ncreatures—wild dogs they seemed—that rushed growling\nand snapping in upon it from all sides, so that they sank\ntheir white fangs into the slow brute and were away again\nbefore it could reach them with its huge paws or sweeping tail.",
        "But these were not all that my startled eyes perceived.\nChattering and gibbering through the lower branches of\nthe trees came a company of manlike creatures evidently\nurging on the dog pack. They were to all appearances\nstrikingly similar in aspect to the Negro of Africa.\nTheir skins were very black, and their features much\nlike those of the more pronounced Negroid type except\nthat the head receded more rapidly above the eyes,\nleaving little or no forehead. Their arms were rather\nlonger and their legs shorter in proportion to the torso\nthan in man, and later I noticed that their great toes\nprotruded at right angles from their feet—because of their\narboreal habits, I presume. Behind them trailed long,\nslender tails which they used in climbing quite as much as\nthey did either their hands or feet.",
        "I had stumbled to my feet the moment that I discovered\nthat the wolf-dogs were holding the dyryth at bay.\nAt sight of me several of the savage creatures left off\nworrying the great brute to come slinking with bared fangs\ntoward me, and as I turned to run toward the trees again\nto seek safety among the lower branches, I saw a number\nof the man-apes leaping and chattering in the foliage\nof the nearest tree.",
        "Between them and the beasts behind me there was little choice,\nbut at least there was a doubt as to the reception\nthese grotesque parodies on humanity would accord me,\nwhile there was none as to the fate which awaited me\nbeneath the grinning fangs of my fierce pursuers.",
        "And so I raced on toward the trees intending to pass\nbeneath that which held the man-things and take refuge\nin another farther on; but the wolf-dogs were very close\nbehind me—so close that I had despaired of escaping them,\nwhen one of the creatures in the tree above swung\ndown headforemost, his tail looped about a great limb,\nand grasping me beneath my armpits swung me in safety up\namong his fellows.",
        "There they fell to examining me with the utmost excitement\nand curiosity. They picked at my clothing, my hair,\nand my flesh. They turned me about to see if I had a tail,\nand when they discovered that I was not so equipped they\nfell into roars of laughter. Their teeth were very large\nand white and even, except for the upper canines which were\na trifle longer than the others—protruding just a bit\nwhen the mouth was closed.",
        "When they had examined me for a few moments one of them\ndiscovered that my clothing was not a part of me, with the\nresult that garment by garment they tore it from me amidst\npeals of the wildest laughter. Apelike, they essayed\nto don the apparel themselves, but their ingenuity\nwas not sufficient to the task and so they gave it up.",
        "In the meantime I had been straining my eyes to catch\na glimpse of Perry, but nowhere about could I see him,\nalthough the clump of trees in which he had first taken\nrefuge was in full view. I was much exercised by fear\nthat something had befallen him, and though I called his\nname aloud several times there was no response.",
        "Tired at last of playing with my clothing the creatures\nthrew it to the ground, and catching me, one on either side,\nby an arm, started off at a most terrifying pace through\nthe tree tops. Never have I experienced such a journey\nbefore or since—even now I oftentimes awake from a deep\nsleep haunted by the horrid remembrance of that awful experience.",
        "From tree to tree the agile creatures sprang like flying\nsquirrels, while the cold sweat stood upon my brow as I\nglimpsed the depths beneath, into which a single misstep\non the part of either of my bearers would hurl me.\nAs they bore me along, my mind was occupied with a thousand\nbewildering thoughts. What had become of Perry? Would\nI ever see him again? What were the intentions of these\nhalf-human things into whose hands I had fallen? Were they\ninhabitants of the same world into which I had been born?\nNo! It could not be. But yet where else? I had not left\nthat earth—of that I was sure. Still neither could I\nreconcile the things which I had seen to a belief that\nI was still in the world of my birth. With a sigh I gave it up.",
        "We must have traveled several miles through the dark\nand dismal wood when we came suddenly upon a dense\nvillage built high among the branches of the trees.\nAs we approached it my escort broke into wild shouting\nwhich was immediately answered from within, and a moment\nlater a swarm of creatures of the same strange race\nas those who had captured me poured out to meet us.\nAgain I was the center of a wildly chattering horde.\nI was pulled this way and that. Pinched, pounded,\nand thumped until I was black and blue, yet I do not\nthink that their treatment was dictated by either cruelty\nor malice—I was a curiosity, a freak, a new plaything,\nand their childish minds required the added evidence of all\ntheir senses to back up the testimony of their eyes.",
        "Presently they dragged me within the village,\nwhich consisted of several hundred rude shelters\nof boughs and leaves supported upon the branches of the trees.",
        "Between the huts, which sometimes formed crooked streets,\nwere dead branches and the trunks of small trees which connected\nthe huts upon one tree to those within adjoining trees;\nthe whole network of huts and pathways forming an almost\nsolid flooring a good fifty feet above the ground.",
        "I wondered why these agile creatures required connecting\nbridges between the trees, but later when I saw the motley\naggregation of half-savage beasts which they kept within\ntheir village I realized the necessity for the pathways.\nThere were a number of the same vicious wolf-dogs\nwhich we had left worrying the dyryth, and many goatlike\nanimals whose distended udders explained the reasons\nfor their presence.",
        "My guard halted before one of the huts into which I was pushed;\nthen two of the creatures squatted down before the entrance—to\nprevent my escape, doubtless. Though where I should have\nescaped to I certainly had not the remotest conception.\nI had no more than entered the dark shadows of the interior\nthan there fell upon my ears the tones of a familiar voice,\nin prayer.",
        "“Perry!” I cried. “Dear old Perry! Thank the Lord you\nare safe.”",
        "“David! Can it be possible that you escaped?” And the old\nman stumbled toward me and threw his arms about me.",
        "He had seen me fall before the dyryth, and then he had been\nseized by a number of the ape-creatures and borne through\nthe tree tops to their village. His captors had been\nas inquisitive as to his strange clothing as had mine,\nwith the same result. As we looked at each other we\ncould not help but laugh.",
        "“With a tail, David,” remarked Perry, “you would make\na very handsome ape.”",
        "“Maybe we can borrow a couple,” I rejoined. “They seem\nto be quite the thing this season. I wonder what the\ncreatures intend doing with us, Perry. They don’t seem\nreally savage. What do you suppose they can be? You\nwere about to tell me where we are when that great hairy\nfrigate bore down upon us—have you really any idea at all?”",
        "“Yes, David,” he replied, “I know precisely where we are.\nWe have made a magnificent discovery, my boy! We have\nproved that the earth is hollow. We have passed entirely\nthrough its crust to the inner world.”",
        "“Perry, you are mad!”",
        "“Not at all, David. For two hundred and fifty miles our\nprospector bore us through the crust beneath our outer world.\nAt that point it reached the center of gravity of the\nfive-hundred-mile-thick crust. Up to that point we had been\ndescending—direction is, of course, merely relative.\nThen at the moment that our seats revolved—the thing\nthat made you believe that we had turned about and were\nspeeding upward—we passed the center of gravity and,\nthough we did not alter the direction of our progress,\nyet we were in reality moving upward—toward the surface\nof the inner world. Does not the strange fauna and flora\nwhich we have seen convince you that you are not in the\nworld of your birth? And the horizon—could it present\nthe strange aspects which we both noted unless we were\nindeed standing upon the inside surface of a sphere?”",
        "“But the sun, Perry!” I urged. “How in the world can\nthe sun shine through five hundred miles of solid crust?”",
        "“It is not the sun of the outer world that we see here.\nIt is another sun—an entirely different sun—that\ncasts its eternal noonday effulgence upon the face\nof the inner world. Look at it now, David—if you can\nsee it from the doorway of this hut—and you will see\nthat it is still in the exact center of the heavens.\nWe have been here for many hours—yet it is still noon.",
        "“And withal it is very simple, David. The earth was once\na nebulous mass. It cooled, and as it cooled it shrank.\nAt length a thin crust of solid matter formed upon\nits outer surface—a sort of shell; but within it was\npartially molten matter and highly expanded gases.\nAs it continued to cool, what happened? Centrifugal\nforce burled the particles of the nebulous center toward\nthe crust as rapidly as they approached a solid state.\nYou have seen the same principle practically applied\nin the modern cream separator. Presently there was only\na small super-heated core of gaseous matter remaining\nwithin a huge vacant interior left by the contraction\nof the cooling gases. The equal attraction of the solid\ncrust from all directions maintained this luminous core\nin the exact center of the hollow globe. What remains\nof it is the sun you saw today—a relatively tiny thing\nat the exact center of the earth. Equally to every part\nof this inner world it diffuses its perpetual noonday light\nand torrid heat.",
        "“This inner world must have cooled sufficiently to\nsupport animal life long ages after life appeared upon\nthe outer crust, but that the same agencies were at work\nhere is evident from the similar forms of both animal\nand vegetable creation which we have already seen.\nTake the great beast which attacked us, for example.\nUnquestionably a counterpart of the Megatherium of the\npost-Pliocene period of the outer crust, whose fossilized\nskeleton has been found in South America.”",
        "“But the grotesque inhabitants of this forest?” I urged.\n\"Surely they have no counterpart in the earth’s history.”",
        "“Who can tell?” he rejoined. “They may constitute the\nlink between ape and man, all traces of which have been\nswallowed by the countless convulsions which have racked\nthe outer crust, or they may be merely the result of evolution\nalong slightly different lines—either is quite possible.”",
        "Further speculation was interrupted by the appearance\nof several of our captors before the entrance of the hut.\nTwo of them entered and dragged us forth. The perilous\npathways and the surrounding trees were filled with\nthe black ape-men, their females, and their young.\nThere was not an ornament, a weapon, or a garment among\nthe lot.",
        "“Quite low in the scale of creation,” commented Perry.",
        "“Quite high enough to play the deuce with us, though,\"\nI replied. “Now what do you suppose they intend doing\nwith us?”",
        "We were not long in learning. As on the occasion of our\ntrip to the village we were seized by a couple of the\npowerful creatures and whirled away through the tree tops,\nwhile about us and in our wake raced a chattering,\njabbering, grinning horde of sleek, black ape-things.",
        "Twice my bearers missed their footing, and my heart ceased\nbeating as we plunged toward instant death among the tangled\ndeadwood beneath. But on both occasions those lithe,\npowerful tails reached out and found sustaining branches,\nnor did either of the creatures loosen their grasp upon me.\nIn fact, it seemed that the incidents were of no greater\nmoment to them than would be the stubbing of one’s toe\nat a street crossing in the outer world—they but laughed\nuproariously and sped on with me.",
        "For some time they continued through the forest—how long\nI could not guess for I was learning, what was later\nborne very forcefully to my mind, that time ceases to be\na factor the moment means for measuring it cease to exist.\nOur watches were gone, and we were living beneath a\nstationary sun. Already I was puzzled to compute the period\nof time which had elapsed since we broke through the crust\nof the inner world. It might be hours, or it might be\ndays—who in the world could tell where it was always\nnoon! By the sun, no time had elapsed—but my judgment\ntold me that we must have been several hours in this\nstrange world.",
        "Presently the forest terminated, and we came out upon\na level plain. A short distance before us rose a few low,\nrocky hills. Toward these our captors urged us, and after\na short time led us through a narrow pass into a tiny,\ncircular valley. Here they got down to work, and we\nwere soon convinced that if we were not to die to make\na Roman holiday, we were to die for some other purpose.\nThe attitude of our captors altered immediately as they\nentered the natural arena within the rocky hills.\nTheir laughter ceased. Grim ferocity marked their bestial\nfaces—bared fangs menaced us.",
        "We were placed in the center of the amphitheater—the\nthousand creatures forming a great ring about us.\nThen a wolf-dog was brought—hyaenadon Perry called it—and\nturned loose with us inside the circle. The thing’s\nbody was as large as that of a full-grown mastiff,\nits legs were short and powerful, and its jaws broad\nand strong. Dark, shaggy hair covered its back and sides,\nwhile its breast and belly were quite white. As it slunk\ntoward us it presented a most formidable aspect with its\nupcurled lips baring its mighty fangs.",
        "Perry was on his knees, praying. I stooped and picked\nup a small stone. At my movement the beast veered off\na bit and commenced circling us. Evidently it had been\na target for stones before. The ape-things were dancing\nup and down urging the brute on with savage cries,\nuntil at last, seeing that I did not throw, he charged us.",
        "At Andover, and later at Yale, I had pitched on winning\nball teams. My speed and control must both have been\nabove the ordinary, for I made such a record during\nmy senior year at college that overtures were made\nto me in behalf of one of the great major-league teams;\nbut in the tightest pitch that ever had confronted me\nin the past I had never been in such need for control\nas now.",
        "As I wound up for the delivery, I held my nerves and muscles\nunder absolute command, though the grinning jaws were\nhurtling toward me at terrific speed. And then I let go,\nwith every ounce of my weight and muscle and science in back\nof that throw. The stone caught the hyaenodon full upon\nthe end of the nose, and sent him bowling over upon his back.",
        "At the same instant a chorus of shrieks and howls arose\nfrom the circle of spectators, so that for a moment\nI thought that the upsetting of their champion was\nthe cause; but in this I soon saw that I was mistaken.\nAs I looked, the ape-things broke in all directions\ntoward the surrounding hills, and then I distinguished\nthe real cause of their perturbation. Behind them,\nstreaming through the pass which leads into the valley,\ncame a swarm of hairy men—gorilla-like creatures armed\nwith spears and hatchets, and bearing long, oval shields.\nLike demons they set upon the ape-things, and before\nthem the hyaenodon, which had now regained its senses\nand its feet, fled howling with fright. Past us swept\nthe pursued and the pursuers, nor did the hairy ones accord\nus more than a passing glance until the arena had been\nemptied of its former occupants. Then they returned to us,\nand one who seemed to have authority among them directed\nthat we be brought with them.",
        "When we had passed out of the amphitheater onto the\ngreat plain we saw a caravan of men and women—human\nbeings like ourselves—and for the first time hope\nand relief filled my heart, until I could have cried\nout in the exuberance of my happiness. It is true\nthat they were a half-naked, wild-appearing aggregation;\nbut they at least were fashioned along the same lines\nas ourselves—there was nothing grotesque or horrible about\nthem as about the other creatures in this strange,\nweird world.",
        "But as we came closer, our hearts sank once more, for we\ndiscovered that the poor wretches were chained neck to neck\nin a long line, and that the gorilla-men were their guards.\nWith little ceremony Perry and I were chained at the end\nof the line, and without further ado the interrupted\nmarch was resumed.",
        "Up to this time the excitement had kept us both up;\nbut now the tiresome monotony of the long march\nacross the sun-baked plain brought on all the agonies\nconsequent to a long-denied sleep. On and on we stumbled\nbeneath that hateful noonday sun. If we fell we were\nprodded with a sharp point. Our companions in chains\ndid not stumble. They strode along proudly erect.\nOccasionally they would exchange words with one another\nin a monosyllabic language. They were a noble-appearing\nrace with well-formed heads and perfect physiques.\nThe men were heavily bearded, tall and muscular; the women,\nsmaller and more gracefully molded, with great masses\nof raven hair caught into loose knots upon their heads.\nThe features of both sexes were well proportioned—there\nwas not a face among them that would have been called\neven plain if judged by earthly standards. They wore\nno ornaments; but this I later learned was due to the\nfact that their captors had stripped them of everything\nof value. As garmenture the women possessed a single\nrobe of some light-colored, spotted hide, rather similar\nin appearance to a leopard’s skin. This they wore either\nsupported entirely about the waist by a leathern thong,\nso that it hung partially below the knee on one side,\nor possibly looped gracefully across one shoulder.\nTheir feet were shod with skin sandals. The men wore\nloin cloths of the hide of some shaggy beast, long ends\nof which depended before and behind nearly to the ground.\nIn some instances these ends were finished with the\nstrong talons of the beast from which the hides had\nbeen taken.",
        "Our guards, whom I already have described as gorilla-like men,\nwere rather lighter in build than a gorilla, but even so\nthey were indeed mighty creatures. Their arms and legs\nwere proportioned more in conformity with human standards,\nbut their entire bodies were covered with shaggy, brown hair,\nand their faces were quite as brutal as those of the few stuffed\nspecimens of the gorilla which I had seen in the museums at home.",
        "Their only redeeming feature lay in the development\nof the head above and back of the ears. In this\nrespect they were not one whit less human than we.\nThey were clothed in a sort of tunic of light cloth which\nreached to the knees. Beneath this they wore only a loin\ncloth of the same material, while their feet were shod\nwith thick hide of some mammoth creature of this inner world.",
        "Their arms and necks were encircled by many ornaments of\nmetal—silver predominating—and on their tunics were sewn\nthe heads of tiny reptiles in odd and rather artistic designs.\nThey talked among themselves as they marched along on\neither side of us, but in a language which I perceived\ndiffered from that employed by our fellow prisoners.\nWhen they addressed the latter they used what appeared\nto be a third language, and which I later learned is\na mongrel tongue rather analogous to the Pidgin-English\nof the Chinese coolie.",
        "How far we marched I have no conception, nor has Perry.\nBoth of us were asleep much of the time for hours before\na halt was called—then we dropped in our tracks.\nI say “for hours,” but how may one measure time where time\ndoes not exist! When our march commenced the sun stood\nat zenith. When we halted our shadows still pointed\ntoward nadir. Whether an instant or an eternity of\nearthly time elapsed who may say. That march may have\noccupied nine years and eleven months of the ten years\nthat I spent in the inner world, or it may have been\naccomplished in the fraction of a second—I cannot tell.\nBut this I do know that since you have told me that ten\nyears have elapsed since I departed from this earth\nI have lost all respect for time—I am commencing to\ndoubt that such a thing exists other than in the weak,\nfinite mind of man.",
        "When our guards aroused us from sleep we were much refreshed.\nThey gave us food. Strips of dried meat it was, but it\nput new life and strength into us, so that now we too\nmarched with high-held heads, and took noble strides.\nAt least I did, for I was young and proud; but poor Perry\nhated walking. On earth I had often seen him call a cab\nto travel a square—he was paying for it now, and his old\nlegs wobbled so that I put my arm about him and half carried\nhim through the balance of those frightful marches.",
        "The country began to change at last, and we wound up\nout of the level plain through mighty mountains of\nvirgin granite. The tropical verdure of the lowlands was\nreplaced by hardier vegetation, but even here the effects\nof constant heat and light were apparent in the immensity\nof the trees and the profusion of foliage and blooms.\nCrystal streams roared through their rocky channels,\nfed by the perpetual snows which we could see far above us.\nAbove the snowcapped heights hung masses of heavy clouds.\nIt was these, Perry explained, which evidently served\nthe double purpose of replenishing the melting snows and\nprotecting them from the direct rays of the sun.",
        "By this time we had picked up a smattering of the bastard\nlanguage in which our guards addressed us, as well\nas making good headway in the rather charming tongue\nof our co-captives. Directly ahead of me in the chain\ngang was a young woman. Three feet of chain linked us\ntogether in a forced companionship which I, at least,\nsoon rejoiced in. For I found her a willing teacher,\nand from her I learned the language of her tribe,\nand much of the life and customs of the inner world—at\nleast that part of it with which she was familiar.",
        "She told me that she was called Dian the Beautiful,\nand that she belonged to the tribe of Amoz, which dwells\nin the cliffs above the Darel Az, or shallow sea.",
        "“How came you here?” I asked her.",
        "“I was running away from Jubal the Ugly One,” she answered,\nas though that was explanation quite sufficient.",
        "“Who is Jubal the Ugly One?” I asked. “And why did you\nrun away from him?”",
        "She looked at me in surprise.",
        "“Why DOES a woman run away from a man?” she answered\nmy question with another.",
        "“They do not, where I come from,” I replied.\n\"Sometimes they run after them.”",
        "But she could not understand. Nor could I get her to grasp\nthe fact that I was of another world. She was quite as\npositive that creation was originated solely to produce her\nown kind and the world she lived in as are many of the outer world.",
        "“But Jubal,” I insisted. “Tell me about him, and why you\nran away to be chained by the neck and scourged across\nthe face of a world.”",
        "“Jubal the Ugly One placed his trophy before my father’s house.\nIt was the head of a mighty tandor. It remained there\nand no greater trophy was placed beside it. So I knew\nthat Jubal the Ugly One would come and take me as his mate.\nNone other so powerful wished me, or they would have\nslain a mightier beast and thus have won me from Jubal.\nMy father is not a mighty hunter. Once he was,\nbut a sadok tossed him, and never again had he the full\nuse of his right arm. My brother, Dacor the Strong One,\nhad gone to the land of Sari to steal a mate for himself.\nThus there was none, father, brother, or lover, to save\nme from Jubal the Ugly One, and I ran away and hid among\nthe hills that skirt the land of Amoz. And there these\nSagoths found me and made me captive.”",
        "“What will they do with you?” I asked. “Where are they\ntaking us?”",
        "Again she looked her incredulity.",
        "“I can almost believe that you are of another world,\"\nshe said, “for otherwise such ignorance were inexplicable.\nDo you really mean that you do not know that the Sagoths\nare the creatures of the Mahars—the mighty Mahars who\nthink they own Pellucidar and all that walks or grows\nupon its surface, or creeps or burrows beneath, or swims\nwithin its lakes and oceans, or flies through its air?\nNext you will be telling me that you never before heard\nof the Mahars!”",
        "I was loath to do it, and further incur her scorn;\nbut there was no alternative if I were to absorb knowledge,\nso I made a clean breast of my pitiful ignorance as to the\nmighty Mahars. She was shocked. But she did her very best\nto enlighten me, though much that she said was as Greek\nwould have been to her. She described the Mahars largely\nby comparisons. In this way they were like unto thipdars,\nin that to the hairless lidi.",
        "About all I gleaned of them was that they were\nquite hideous, had wings, and webbed feet; lived in\ncities built beneath the ground; could swim under\nwater for great distances, and were very, very wise.\nThe Sagoths were their weapons of offense and defense,\nand the races like herself were their hands and feet—they\nwere the slaves and servants who did all the manual labor.\nThe Mahars were the heads—the brains—of the inner world.\nI longed to see this wondrous race of supermen.",
        "Perry learned the language with me. When we halted,\nas we occasionally did, though sometimes the halts seemed\nages apart, he would join in the conversation, as would\nGhak the Hairy One, he who was chained just ahead of Dian\nthe Beautiful. Ahead of Ghak was Hooja the Sly One.\nHe too entered the conversation occasionally. Most of\nhis remarks were directed toward Dian the Beautiful.\nIt didn’t take half an eye to see that he had developed\na bad case; but the girl appeared totally oblivious\nto his thinly veiled advances. Did I say thinly veiled?\nThere is a race of men in New Zealand, or Australia,\nI have forgotten which, who indicate their preference\nfor the lady of their affections by banging her over\nthe head with a bludgeon. By comparison with this method\nHooja’s lovemaking might be called thinly veiled.\nAt first it caused me to blush violently although I\nhave seen several Old Years out at Rectors, and in other\nless fashionable places off Broadway, and in Vienna,\nand Hamburg.",
        "But the girl! She was magnificent. It was easy to see\nthat she considered herself as entirely above and apart from\nher present surroundings and company. She talked with me,\nand with Perry, and with the taciturn Ghak because we\nwere respectful; but she couldn’t even see Hooja the\nSly One, much less hear him, and that made him furious.\nHe tried to get one of the Sagoths to move the girl up\nahead of him in the slave gang, but the fellow only poked\nhim with his spear and told him that he had selected the\ngirl for his own property—that he would buy her from the\nMahars as soon as they reached Phutra. Phutra, it seemed,\nwas the city of our destination.",
        "After passing over the first chain of mountains we skirted\na salt sea, upon whose bosom swam countless horrid things.\nSeal-like creatures there were with long necks stretching\nten and more feet above their enormous bodies and whose\nsnake heads were split with gaping mouths bristling\nwith countless fangs. There were huge tortoises too,\npaddling about among these other reptiles, which Perry\nsaid were Plesiosaurs of the Lias. I didn’t question his\nveracity—they might have been most anything.",
        "Dian told me they were tandorazes, or tandors of the sea,\nand that the other, and more fearsome reptiles, which occasionally\nrose from the deep to do battle with them, were azdyryths,\nor sea-dyryths—Perry called them Ichthyosaurs.\nThey resembled a whale with the head of an alligator.",
        "I had forgotten what little geology I had studied\nat school—about all that remained was an impression\nof horror that the illustrations of restored prehistoric\nmonsters had made upon me, and a well-defined belief\nthat any man with a pig’s shank and a vivid imagination\ncould “restore” most any sort of paleolithic monster he\nsaw fit, and take rank as a first class paleontologist.\nBut when I saw these sleek, shiny carcasses shimmering in\nthe sunlight as they emerged from the ocean, shaking their\ngiant heads; when I saw the waters roll from their sinuous\nbodies in miniature waterfalls as they glided hither\nand thither, now upon the surface, now half submerged;\nas I saw them meet, open-mouthed, hissing and snorting,\nin their titanic and interminable warring I realized\nhow futile is man’s poor, weak imagination by comparison\nwith Nature’s incredible genius.",
        "And Perry! He was absolutely flabbergasted. He said\nso himself.",
        "“David,” he remarked, after we had marched for a long time\nbeside that awful sea. “David, I used to teach geology,\nand I thought that I believed what I taught; but now I\nsee that I did not believe it—that it is impossible\nfor man to believe such things as these unless he sees\nthem with his own eyes. We take things for granted,\nperhaps, because we are told them over and over again,\nand have no way of disproving them—like religions,\nfor example; but we don’t believe them, we only think\nwe do. If you ever get back to the outer world you\nwill find that the geologists and paleontologists will\nbe the first to set you down a liar, for they know\nthat no such creatures as they restore ever existed.\nIt is all right to IMAGINE them as existing in an equally\nimaginary epoch—but now? poof!”",
        "At the next halt Hooja the Sly One managed to find enough\nslack chain to permit him to worm himself back quite close\nto Dian. We were all standing, and as he edged near the\ngirl she turned her back upon him in such a truly earthly\nfeminine manner that I could scarce repress a smile; but it\nwas a short-lived smile for on the instant the Sly One’s\nhand fell upon the girl’s bare arm, jerking her roughly\ntoward him.",
        "I was not then familiar with the customs or social ethics\nwhich prevailed within Pellucidar; but even so I did\nnot need the appealing look which the girl shot to me\nfrom her magnificent eyes to influence my subsequent act.\nWhat the Sly One’s intention was I paused not to inquire;\nbut instead, before he could lay hold of her with his\nother hand, I placed a right to the point of his jaw that\nfelled him in his tracks.",
        "A roar of approval went up from those of the other prisoners\nand the Sagoths who had witnessed the brief drama; not, as I\nlater learned, because I had championed the girl, but for\nthe neat and, to them, astounding method by which I had bested Hooja.",
        "And the girl? At first she looked at me with wide, wondering eyes,\nand then she dropped her head, her face half averted,\nand a delicate flush suffused her cheek. For a moment\nshe stood thus in silence, and then her head went high,\nand she turned her back upon me as she had upon Hooja.\nSome of the prisoners laughed, and I saw the face of Ghak\nthe Hairy One go very black as he looked at me searchingly.\nAnd what I could see of Dian’s cheek went suddenly from red\nto white.",
        "Immediately after we resumed the march, and though I realized\nthat in some way I had offended Dian the Beautiful I could\nnot prevail upon her to talk with me that I might learn\nwherein I had erred—in fact I might quite as well have\nbeen addressing a sphinx for all the attention I got.\nAt last my own foolish pride stepped in and prevented\nmy making any further attempts, and thus a companionship\nthat without my realizing it had come to mean a great deal\nto me was cut off. Thereafter I confined my conversation\nto Perry. Hooja did not renew his advances toward the girl,\nnor did he again venture near me.",
        "Again the weary and apparently interminable marching became\na perfect nightmare of horrors to me. The more firmly\nfixed became the realization that the girl’s friendship\nhad meant so much to me, the more I came to miss it;\nand the more impregnable the barrier of silly pride.\nBut I was very young and would not ask Ghak for the\nexplanation which I was sure he could give, and that might\nhave made everything all right again.",
        "On the march, or during halts, Dian refused consistently\nto notice me—when her eyes wandered in my direction\nshe looked either over my head or directly through me.\nAt last I became desperate, and determined to swallow\nmy self-esteem, and again beg her to tell me how I\nhad offended, and how I might make reparation. I made\nup my mind that I should do this at the next halt.\nWe were approaching another range of mountains at the time,\nand when we reached them, instead of winding across\nthem through some high-flung pass we entered a mighty\nnatural tunnel—a series of labyrinthine grottoes,\ndark as Erebus.",
        "The guards had no torches or light of any description.\nIn fact we had seen no artificial light or sign of\nfire since we had entered Pellucidar. In a land of\nperpetual noon there is no need of light above ground,\nyet I marveled that they had no means of lighting\ntheir way through these dark, subterranean passages.\nSo we crept along at a snail’s pace, with much stumbling\nand falling—the guards keeping up a singsong chant ahead\nof us, interspersed with certain high notes which I found\nalways indicated rough places and turns.",
        "Halts were now more frequent, but I did not wish to speak\nto Dian until I could see from the expression of her face\nhow she was receiving my apologies. At last a faint\nglow ahead forewarned us of the end of the tunnel,\nfor which I for one was devoutly thankful. Then at a sudden\nturn we emerged into the full light of the noonday sun.",
        "But with it came a sudden realization of what meant\nto me a real catastrophe—Dian was gone, and with her\na half-dozen other prisoners. The guards saw it too,\nand the ferocity of their rage was terrible to behold.\nTheir awesome, bestial faces were contorted in the most\ndiabolical expressions, as they accused each other of\nresponsibility for the loss. Finally they fell upon us,\nbeating us with their spear shafts, and hatchets.\nThey had already killed two near the head of the line,\nand were like to have finished the balance of us when\ntheir leader finally put a stop to the brutal slaughter.\nNever in all my life had I witnessed a more horrible\nexhibition of bestial rage—I thanked God that Dian had not\nbeen one of those left to endure it.",
        "Of the twelve prisoners who had been chained ahead of me\neach alternate one had been freed commencing with Dian.\nHooja was gone. Ghak remained. What could it mean? How\nhad it been accomplished? The commander of the guards\nwas investigating. Soon he discovered that the rude\nlocks which had held the neckbands in place had been\ndeftly picked.",
        "“Hooja the Sly One,” murmured Ghak, who was now next to me\nin line. “He has taken the girl that you would not have,\"\nhe continued, glancing at me.",
        "“That I would not have!” I cried. “What do you mean?”",
        "He looked at me closely for a moment.",
        "“I have doubted your story that you are from another world,\"\nhe said at last, “but yet upon no other grounds could\nyour ignorance of the ways of Pellucidar be explained.\nDo you really mean that you do not know that you offended\nthe Beautiful One, and how?”",
        "“I do not know, Ghak,” I replied.",
        "“Then shall I tell you. When a man of Pellucidar\nintervenes between another man and the woman the other\nman would have, the woman belongs to the victor.\nDian the Beautiful belongs to you. You should have claimed\nher or released her. Had you taken her hand, it would\nhave indicated your desire to make her your mate, and had\nyou raised her hand above her head and then dropped it,\nit would have meant that you did not wish her for a mate\nand that you released her from all obligation to you.\nBy doing neither you have put upon her the greatest affront\nthat a man may put upon a woman. Now she is your slave.\nNo man will take her as mate, or may take her honorably,\nuntil he shall have overcome you in combat, and men do not\nchoose slave women as their mates—at least not the men\nof Pellucidar.”",
        "“I did not know, Ghak,” I cried. “I did not know.\nNot for all Pellucidar would I have harmed Dian the Beautiful\nby word, or look, or act of mine. I do not want her as\nmy slave. I do not want her as my—” but here I stopped.\nThe vision of that sweet and innocent face floated before\nme amidst the soft mists of imagination, and where I had\non the second believed that I clung only to the memory\nof a gentle friendship I had lost, yet now it seemed\nthat it would have been disloyalty to her to have said\nthat I did not want Dian the Beautiful as my mate.\nI had not thought of her except as a welcome friend\nin a strange, cruel world. Even now I did not think\nthat I loved her.",
        "I believe Ghak must have read the truth more in my\nexpression than in my words, for presently he laid\nhis hand upon my shoulder.",
        "“Man of another world,” he said, “I believe you.\nLips may lie, but when the heart speaks through the eyes\nit tells only the truth. Your heart has spoken to me.\nI know now that you meant no affront to Dian the Beautiful.\nShe is not of my tribe; but her mother is my sister.\nShe does not know it—her mother was stolen by Dian’s\nfather who came with many others of the tribe of Amoz\nto battle with us for our women—the most beautiful women\nof Pellucidar. Then was her father king of Amoz, and her\nmother was daughter of the king of Sari—to whose power I,\nhis son, have succeeded. Dian is the daughter of kings,\nthough her father is no longer king since the sadok tossed\nhim and Jubal the Ugly One wrested his kingship from him.\nBecause of her lineage the wrong you did her was greatly\nmagnified in the eyes of all who saw it. She will never\nforgive you.”",
        "I asked Ghak if there was not some way in which I\ncould release the girl from the bondage and ignominy\nI had unwittingly placed upon her.",
        "“If ever you find her, yes,” he answered. “Merely to\nraise her hand above her head and drop it in the presence\nof others is sufficient to release her; but how may you\never find her, you who are doomed to a life of slavery\nyourself in the buried city of Phutra?”",
        "“Is there no escape?” I asked.",
        "“Hooja the Sly One escaped and took the others with him,\"\nreplied Ghak. “But there are no more dark places on\nthe way to Phutra, and once there it is not so easy—the\nMahars are very wise. Even if one escaped from Phutra\nthere are the thipdars—they would find you, and then—\"\nthe Hairy One shuddered. “No, you will never escape\nthe Mahars.”",
        "It was a cheerful prospect. I asked Perry what he thought\nabout it; but he only shrugged his shoulders and continued\na longwinded prayer he had been at for some time.\nHe was wont to say that the only redeeming feature of our\ncaptivity was the ample time it gave him for the improvisation\nof prayers—it was becoming an obsession with him.\nThe Sagoths had begun to take notice of his habit\nof declaiming throughout entire marches. One of them\nasked him what he was saying—to whom he was talking.\nThe question gave me an idea, so I answered quickly\nbefore Perry could say anything.",
        "“Do not interrupt him,” I said. “He is a very holy\nman in the world from which we come. He is speaking\nto spirits which you cannot see—do not interrupt him\nor they will spring out of the air upon you and rend you\nlimb from limb—like that,” and I jumped toward the great\nbrute with a loud “Boo!” that sent him stumbling backward.",
        "I took a long chance, I realized, but if we could make\nany capital out of Perry’s harmless mania I wanted to make\nit while the making was prime. It worked splendidly.\nThe Sagoths treated us both with marked respect during\nthe balance of the journey, and then passed the word along\nto their masters, the Mahars.",
        "Two marches after this episode we came to the city of Phutra.\nThe entrance to it was marked by two lofty towers of granite,\nwhich guarded a flight of steps leading to the buried city.\nSagoths were on guard here as well as at a hundred or more\nother towers scattered about over a large plain.",
        "As we descended the broad staircase which led to the main\navenue of Phutra I caught my first sight of the dominant\nrace of the inner world. Involuntarily I shrank back\nas one of the creatures approached to inspect us.\nA more hideous thing it would be impossible to imagine.\nThe all-powerful Mahars of Pellucidar are great reptiles,\nsome six or eight feet in length, with long narrow heads\nand great round eyes. Their beak-like mouths are lined\nwith sharp, white fangs, and the backs of their huge,\nlizard bodies are serrated into bony ridges from their\nnecks to the end of their long tails. Their feet are\nequipped with three webbed toes, while from the fore feet\nmembranous wings, which are attached to their bodies just\nin front of the hind legs, protrude at an angle of 45\ndegrees toward the rear, ending in sharp points several\nfeet above their bodies.",
        "I glanced at Perry as the thing passed me to inspect him.\nThe old man was gazing at the horrid creature with wide\nastonished eyes. When it passed on, he turned to me.",
        "“A rhamphorhynchus of the Middle Olitic, David,” he said,\n\"but, gad, how enormous! The largest remains we ever\nhave discovered have never indicated a size greater than\nthat attained by an ordinary crow.”",
        "As we continued on through the main avenue of Phutra we\nsaw many thousand of the creatures coming and going upon\ntheir daily duties. They paid but little attention to us.\nPhutra is laid out underground with a regularity that\nindicates remarkable engineering skill. It is hewn from\nsolid limestone strata. The streets are broad and of a\nuniform height of twenty feet. At intervals tubes pierce\nthe roof of this underground city, and by means of lenses\nand reflectors transmit the sunlight, softened and diffused,\nto dispel what would otherwise be Cimmerian darkness.\nIn like manner air is introduced.",
        "Perry and I were taken, with Ghak, to a large public building,\nwhere one of the Sagoths who had formed our guard explained\nto a Maharan official the circumstances surrounding our capture.\nThe method of communication between these two was remarkable\nin that no spoken words were exchanged. They employed\na species of sign language. As I was to learn later,\nthe Mahars have no ears, not any spoken language.\nAmong themselves they communicate by means of what Perry\nsays must be a sixth sense which is cognizant of a fourth dimension.",
        "I never did quite grasp him, though he endeavored to explain\nit to me upon numerous occasions. I suggested telepathy,\nbut he said no, that it was not telepathy since they could\nonly communicate when in each others’ presence, nor could\nthey talk with the Sagoths or the other inhabitants\nof Pellucidar by the same method they used to converse\nwith one another.",
        "“What they do,” said Perry, “is to project their thoughts\ninto the fourth dimension, when they become appreciable\nto the sixth sense of their listener. Do I make myself\nquite clear?”",
        "“You do not, Perry,” I replied. He shook his head\nin despair, and returned to his work. They had set us\nto carrying a great accumulation of Maharan literature\nfrom one apartment to another, and there arranging it\nupon shelves. I suggested to Perry that we were in the\npublic library of Phutra, but later, as he commenced\nto discover the key to their written language, he assured\nme that we were handling the ancient archives of the race.",
        "During this period my thoughts were continually upon\nDian the Beautiful. I was, of course, glad that she had\nescaped the Mahars, and the fate that had been suggested\nby the Sagoth who had threatened to purchase her upon our\narrival at Phutra. I often wondered if the little party\nof fugitives had been overtaken by the guards who had returned\nto search for them. Sometimes I was not so sure but that I\nshould have been more contented to know that Dian was here\nin Phutra, than to think of her at the mercy of Hooja\nthe Sly One. Ghak, Perry, and I often talked together\nof possible escape, but the Sarian was so steeped in his\nlifelong belief that no one could escape from the Mahars\nexcept by a miracle, that he was not much aid to us—his\nattitude was of one who waits for the miracle to come to him.",
        "At my suggestion Perry and I fashioned some swords of scraps\nof iron which we discovered among some rubbish in the cells\nwhere we slept, for we were permitted almost unrestrained\nfreedom of action within the limits of the building to which\nwe had been assigned. So great were the number of slaves\nwho waited upon the inhabitants of Phutra that none of us\nwas apt to be overburdened with work, nor were our masters\nunkind to us.",
        "We hid our new weapons beneath the skins which formed\nour beds, and then Perry conceived the idea of making bows\nand arrows—weapons apparently unknown within Pellucidar.\nNext came shields; but these I found it easier to steal\nfrom the walls of the outer guardroom of the building.",
        "We had completed these arrangements for our protection\nafter leaving Phutra when the Sagoths who had been sent\nto recapture the escaped prisoners returned with four\nof them, of whom Hooja was one. Dian and two others\nhad eluded them. It so happened that Hooja was confined\nin the same building with us. He told Ghak that he had\nnot seen Dian or the others after releasing them within\nthe dark grotto. What had become of them he had not\nthe faintest conception—they might be wandering yet,\nlost within the labyrinthine tunnel, if not dead\nfrom starvation.",
        "I was now still further apprehensive as to the fate\nof Dian, and at this time, I imagine, came the first\nrealization that my affection for the girl might be\nprompted by more than friendship. During my waking\nhours she was constantly the subject of my thoughts,\nand when I slept her dear face haunted my dreams.\nMore than ever was I determined to escape the Mahars.",
        "“Perry, “ I confided to the old man, “if I have to search\nevery inch of this diminutive world I am going to find\nDian the Beautiful and right the wrong I unintentionally\ndid her.” That was the excuse I made for Perry’s benefit.",
        "“Diminutive world!” he scoffed. “You don’t know what you\nare talking about, my boy,” and then he showed me a map\nof Pellucidar which he had recently discovered among\nthe manuscript he was arranging.",
        "“Look,” he cried, pointing to it, “this is evidently water,\nand all this land. Do you notice the general configuration\nof the two areas? Where the oceans are upon the outer crust,\nis land here. These relatively small areas of ocean follow\nthe general lines of the continents of the outer world.",
        "“We know that the crust of the globe is 500 miles in thickness;\nthen the inside diameter of Pellucidar must be 7,000 miles,\nand the superficial area 165,480,000 square miles.\nThree-fourths of this is land. Think of it! A land area\nof 124,110,000 square miles! Our own world contains\nbut 53,000,000 square miles of land, the balance of its\nsurface being covered by water. Just as we often compare\nnations by their relative land areas, so if we compare\nthese two worlds in the same way we have the strange\nanomaly of a larger world within a smaller one!",
        "“Where within vast Pellucidar would you search for your\nDian? Without stars, or moon, or changing sun how could\nyou find her even though you knew where she might be found?”",
        "The proposition was a corker. It quite took my breath away;\nbut I found that it left me all the more determined\nto attempt it.",
        "“If Ghak will accompany us we may be able to do it,\"\nI suggested.",
        "Perry and I sought him out and put the question straight\nto him.",
        "“Ghak,” I said, “we are determined to escape from\nthis bondage. Will you accompany us?”",
        "“They will set the thipdars upon us,” he said, “and then\nwe shall be killed; but—” he hesitated—\"I would take\nthe chance if I thought that I might possibly escape\nand return to my own people.”",
        "“Could you find your way back to your own land?” asked Perry.\n\"And could you aid David in his search for Dian?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“But how,” persisted Perry, “could you travel to strange\ncountry without heavenly bodies or a compass to guide you?”",
        "Ghak didn’t know what Perry meant by heavenly bodies\nor a compass, but he assured us that you might blindfold\nany man of Pellucidar and carry him to the farthermost\ncorner of the world, yet he would be able to come directly\nto his own home again by the shortest route. He seemed\nsurprised to think that we found anything wonderful in it.\nPerry said it must be some sort of homing instinct such\nas is possessed by certain breeds of earthly pigeons.\nI didn’t know, of course, but it gave me an idea.",
        "“Then Dian could have found her way directly to her\nown people?” I asked.",
        "“Surely,” replied Ghak, “unless some mighty beast of prey\nkilled her.”",
        "I was for making the attempted escape at once, but both Perry\nand Ghak counseled waiting for some propitious accident\nwhich would insure us some small degree of success.\nI didn’t see what accident could befall a whole community\nin a land of perpetual daylight where the inhabitants had\nno fixed habits of sleep. Why, I am sure that some of the\nMahars never sleep, while others may, at long intervals,\ncrawl into the dark recesses beneath their dwellings and\ncurl up in protracted slumber. Perry says that if a Mahar\nstays awake for three years he will make up all his lost\nsleep in a long year’s snooze. That may be all true, but I\nnever saw but three of them asleep, and it was the sight\nof these three that gave me a suggestion for our means of escape.",
        "I had been searching about far below the levels that we\nslaves were supposed to frequent—possibly fifty feet\nbeneath the main floor of the building—among a network\nof corridors and apartments, when I came suddenly upon\nthree Mahars curled up upon a bed of skins. At first I\nthought they were dead, but later their regular breathing\nconvinced me of my error. Like a flash the thought\ncame to me of the marvelous opportunity these sleeping\nreptiles offered as a means of eluding the watchfulness\nof our captors and the Sagoth guards.",
        "Hastening back to Perry where he pored over a musty pile of,\nto me, meaningless hieroglyphics, I explained my plan to him.\nTo my surprise he was horrified.",
        "“It would be murder, David,” he cried.",
        "“Murder to kill a reptilian monster?” I asked in astonishment.",
        "“Here they are not monsters, David,” he replied.\n\"Here they are the dominant race—we are the ’monsters’—the\nlower orders. In Pellucidar evolution has progressed\nalong different lines than upon the outer earth.\nThese terrible convulsions of nature time and time again\nwiped out the existing species—but for this fact some\nmonster of the Saurozoic epoch might rule today upon\nour own world. We see here what might well have occurred\nin our own history had conditions been what they have been here.",
        "“Life within Pellucidar is far younger than upon the outer crust.\nHere man has but reached a stage analogous to the Stone\nAge of our own world’s history, but for countless millions\nof years these reptiles have been progressing. Possibly it\nis the sixth sense which I am sure they possess that has\ngiven them an advantage over the other and more frightfully\narmed of their fellows; but this we may never know.\nThey look upon us as we look upon the beasts of our fields,\nand I learn from their written records that other races\nof Mahars feed upon men—they keep them in great droves,\nas we keep cattle. They breed them most carefully,\nand when they are quite fat, they kill and eat them.”",
        "I shuddered.",
        "“What is there horrible about it, David?” the old man asked.\n\"They understand us no better than we understand\nthe lower animals of our own world. Why, I have come\nacross here very learned discussions of the question\nas to whether gilaks, that is men, have any means\nof communication. One writer claims that we do not even\nreason—that our every act is mechanical, or instinctive.\nThe dominant race of Pellucidar, David, have not yet\nlearned that men converse among themselves, or reason.\nBecause we do not converse as they do it is beyond them\nto imagine that we converse at all. It is thus that we\nreason in relation to the brutes of our own world.\nThey know that the Sagoths have a spoken language,\nbut they cannot comprehend it, or how it manifests itself,\nsince they have no auditory apparatus. They believe\nthat the motions of the lips alone convey the meaning.\nThat the Sagoths can communicate with us is incomprehensible\nto them.",
        "“Yes, David,” he concluded, “it would entail murder\nto carry out your plan.”",
        "“Very well then, Perry.” I replied. “I shall become\na murderer.”",
        "He got me to go over the plan again most carefully,\nand for some reason which was not at the time clear to me\ninsisted upon a very careful description of the apartments\nand corridors I had just explored.",
        "“I wonder, David,” he said at length, “as you are determined\nto carry out your wild scheme, if we could not accomplish\nsomething of very real and lasting benefit for the human\nrace of Pellucidar at the same time. Listen, I have\nlearned much of a most surprising nature from these\narchives of the Mahars. That you may not appreciate\nmy plan I shall briefly outline the history of the race.",
        "“Once the males were all-powerful, but ages ago the females,\nlittle by little, assumed the mastery. For other ages\nno noticeable change took place in the race of Mahars.\nIt continued to progress under the intelligent and\nbeneficent rule of the ladies. Science took vast strides.\nThis was especially true of the sciences which we know\nas biology and eugenics. Finally a certain female\nscientist announced the fact that she had discovered\na method whereby eggs might be fertilized by chemical\nmeans after they were laid—all true reptiles, you know,\nare hatched from eggs.",
        "“What happened? Immediately the necessity for males ceased\nto exist—the race was no longer dependent upon them.\nMore ages elapsed until at the present time we find a race\nconsisting exclusively of females. But here is the point.\nThe secret of this chemical formula is kept by a single\nrace of Mahars. It is in the city of Phutra, and unless I\nam greatly in error I judge from your description of the\nvaults through which you passed today that it lies hidden\nin the cellar of this building.",
        "“For two reasons they hide it away and guard it jealously.\nFirst, because upon it depends the very life of the race\nof Mahars, and second, owing to the fact that when it\nwas public property as at first so many were experimenting\nwith it that the danger of over-population became very grave.",
        "“David, if we can escape, and at the same time take with\nus this great secret what will we not have accomplished\nfor the human race within Pellucidar!” The very thought\nof it fairly overpowered me. Why, we two would be the\nmeans of placing the men of the inner world in their\nrightful place among created things. Only the Sagoths\nwould then stand between them and absolute supremacy,\nand I was not quite sure but that the Sagoths owed all\ntheir power to the greater intelligence of the Mahars—I\ncould not believe that these gorilla-like beasts\nwere the mental superiors of the human race of Pellucidar.",
        "“Why, Perry,” I exclaimed, “you and I may reclaim\na whole world! Together we can lead the races of men\nout of the darkness of ignorance into the light of\nadvancement and civilization. At one step we may carry\nthem from the Age of Stone to the twentieth century.\nIt’s marvelous—absolutely marvelous just to think about it.”",
        "“David,” said the old man, “I believe that God sent us\nhere for just that purpose—it shall be my life work\nto teach them His word—to lead them into the light\nof His mercy while we are training their hearts and hands\nin the ways of culture and civilization.”",
        "“You are right, Perry,” I said, “and while you are teaching\nthem to pray I’ll be teaching them to fight, and between\nus we’ll make a race of men that will be an honor to us both.”",
        "Ghak had entered the apartment some time before we\nconcluded our conversation, and now he wanted to know\nwhat we were so excited about. Perry thought we had best\nnot tell him too much, and so I only explained that I\nhad a plan for escape. When I had outlined it to him,\nhe seemed about as horror-struck as Perry had been;\nbut for a different reason. The Hairy One only considered\nthe horrible fate that would be ours were we discovered;\nbut at last I prevailed upon him to accept my plan as\nthe only feasible one, and when I had assured him that I\nwould take all the responsibility for it were we captured,\nhe accorded a reluctant assent.",
        "\nWithin Pellucidar one time is as good as another.\nThere were no nights to mask our attempted escape.\nAll must be done in broad daylight—all but the work\nI had to do in the apartment beneath the building.\nSo we determined to put our plan to an immediate test\nlest the Mahars who made it possible should awake before\nI reached them; but we were doomed to disappointment,\nfor no sooner had we reached the main floor of the building\non our way to the pits beneath, than we encountered hurrying\nbands of slaves being hastened under strong Sagoth guard\nout of the edifice to the avenue beyond.",
        "Other Sagoths were darting hither and thither in search\nof other slaves, and the moment that we appeared we were\npounced upon and hustled into the line of marching humans.",
        "What the purpose or nature of the general exodus we did\nnot know, but presently through the line of captives ran\nthe rumor that two escaped slaves had been recaptured—a\nman and a woman—and that we were marching to witness\ntheir punishment, for the man had killed a Sagoth\nof the detachment that had pursued and overtaken them.",
        "At the intelligence my heart sprang to my throat,\nfor I was sure that the two were of those who escaped\nin the dark grotto with Hooja the Sly One, and that Dian\nmust be the woman. Ghak thought so too, as did Perry.",
        "“Is there naught that we may do to save her?” I asked Ghak.",
        "“Naught,” he replied.",
        "Along the crowded avenue we marched, the guards showing\nunusual cruelty toward us, as though we, too, had been\nimplicated in the murder of their fellow. The occasion\nwas to serve as an object-lesson to all other slaves of\nthe danger and futility of attempted escape, and the fatal\nconsequences of taking the life of a superior being,\nand so I imagine that Sagoths felt amply justified in making\nthe entire proceeding as uncomfortable and painful to\nus as possible.",
        "They jabbed us with their spears and struck at us with the\nhatchets at the least provocation, and at no provocation\nat all. It was a most uncomfortable half-hour that we\nspent before we were finally herded through a low entrance\ninto a huge building the center of which was given up\nto a good-sized arena. Benches surrounded this open\nspace upon three sides, and along the fourth were heaped\nhuge bowlders which rose in receding tiers toward the roof.",
        "At first I couldn’t make out the purpose of this mighty\npile of rock, unless it were intended as a rough and\npicturesque background for the scenes which were enacted\nin the arena before it, but presently, after the wooden\nbenches had been pretty well filled by slaves and Sagoths,\nI discovered the purpose of the bowlders, for then\nthe Mahars began to file into the enclosure.",
        "They marched directly across the arena toward the rocks upon\nthe opposite side, where, spreading their bat-like wings,\nthey rose above the high wall of the pit, settling down\nupon the bowlders above. These were the reserved seats,\nthe boxes of the elect.",
        "Reptiles that they are, the rough surface of a great stone\nis to them as plush as upholstery to us. Here they lolled,\nblinking their hideous eyes, and doubtless conversing with\none another in their sixth-sense- fourth-dimension language.",
        "For the first time I beheld their queen. She differed\nfrom the others in no feature that was appreciable\nto my earthly eyes, in fact all Mahars look alike to me:\nbut when she crossed the arena after the balance of her\nfemale subjects had found their bowlders, she was preceded\nby a score of huge Sagoths, the largest I ever had seen,\nand on either side of her waddled a huge thipdar,\nwhile behind came another score of Sagoth guardsmen.",
        "At the barrier the Sagoths clambered up the steep side\nwith truly apelike agility, while behind them the haughty\nqueen rose upon her wings with her two frightful dragons\nclose beside her, and settled down upon the largest\nbowlder of them all in the exact center of that side of\nthe amphitheater which is reserved for the dominant race.\nHere she squatted, a most repulsive and uninteresting queen;\nthough doubtless quite as well assured of her beauty\nand divine right to rule as the proudest monarch of the\nouter world.",
        "And then the music started—music without sound! The Mahars\ncannot hear, so the drums and fifes and horns of earthly\nbands are unknown among them. The “band” consists of a\nscore or more Mahars. It filed out in the center of the\narena where the creatures upon the rocks might see it,\nand there it performed for fifteen or twenty minutes.",
        "Their technic consisted in waving their tails and moving\ntheir heads in a regular succession of measured movements\nresulting in a cadence which evidently pleased the eye\nof the Mahar as the cadence of our own instrumental music\npleases our ears. Sometimes the band took measured steps\nin unison to one side or the other, or backward and again\nforward—it all seemed very silly and meaningless to me,\nbut at the end of the first piece the Mahars upon the\nrocks showed the first indications of enthusiasm that I\nhad seen displayed by the dominant race of Pellucidar.\nThey beat their great wings up and down, and smote their rocky\nperches with their mighty tails until the ground shook.\nThen the band started another piece, and all was again\nas silent as the grave. That was one great beauty about\nMahar music—if you didn’t happen to like a piece that was\nbeing played all you had to do was shut your eyes.",
        "When the band had exhausted its repertory it took wing\nand settled upon the rocks above and behind the queen.\nThen the business of the day was on. A man and woman were\npushed into the arena by a couple of Sagoth guardsmen.\nI leaned forward in my seat to scrutinize the female—hoping\nagainst hope that she might prove to be another than Dian\nthe Beautiful. Her back was toward me for a while,\nand the sight of the great mass of raven hair piled high\nupon her head filled me with alarm.",
        "Presently a door in one side of the arena wall was opened\nto admit a huge, shaggy, bull-like creature.",
        "“A Bos,” whispered Perry, excitedly. “His kind roamed\nthe outer crust with the cave bear and the mammoth ages\nand ages ago. We have been carried back a million years,\nDavid, to the childhood of a planet—is it not wondrous?”",
        "But I saw only the raven hair of a half-naked girl,\nand my heart stood still in dumb misery at the sight of her,\nnor had I any eyes for the wonders of natural history.\nBut for Perry and Ghak I should have leaped to the floor\nof the arena and shared whatever fate lay in store for this\npriceless treasure of the Stone Age.",
        "With the advent of the Bos—they call the thing a thag\nwithin Pellucidar—two spears were tossed into the arena\nat the feet of the prisoners. It seemed to me that a bean\nshooter would have been as effective against the mighty\nmonster as these pitiful weapons.",
        "As the animal approached the two, bellowing and pawing\nthe ground with the strength of many earthly bulls,\nanother door directly beneath us was opened, and from\nit issued the most terrific roar that ever had fallen\nupon my outraged ears. I could not at first see\nthe beast from which emanated this fearsome challenge,\nbut the sound had the effect of bringing the two victims\naround with a sudden start, and then I saw the girl’s\nface—she was not Dian! I could have wept for relief.",
        "And now, as the two stood frozen in terror, I saw the author\nof that fearsome sound creeping stealthily into view.\nIt was a huge tiger—such as hunted the great Bos\nthrough the jungles primeval when the world was young.\nIn contour and markings it was not unlike the noblest\nof the Bengals of our own world, but as its dimensions\nwere exaggerated to colossal proportions so too were\nits colorings exaggerated. Its vivid yellows fairly\nscreamed aloud; its whites were as eider down; its blacks\nglossy as the finest anthracite coal, and its coat long\nand shaggy as a mountain goat. That it is a beautiful\nanimal there is no gainsaying, but if its size and colors\nare magnified here within Pellucidar, so is the ferocity\nof its disposition. It is not the occasional member\nof its species that is a man hunter—all are man hunters;\nbut they do not confine their foraging to man alone,\nfor there is no flesh or fish within Pellucidar that they\nwill not eat with relish in the constant efforts which they\nmake to furnish their huge carcasses with sufficient\nsustenance to maintain their mighty thews.",
        "Upon one side of the doomed pair the thag bellowed\nand advanced, and upon the other tarag, the frightful,\ncrept toward them with gaping mouth and dripping fangs.",
        "The man seized the spears, handing one of them to the woman.\nAt the sound of the roaring of the tiger the bull’s\nbellowing became a veritable frenzy of rageful noise.\nNever in my life had I heard such an infernal din as\nthe two brutes made, and to think it was all lost upon\nthe hideous reptiles for whom the show was staged!",
        "The thag was charging now from one side, and the tarag\nfrom the other. The two puny things standing between them\nseemed already lost, but at the very moment that the beasts\nwere upon them the man grasped his companion by the arm\nand together they leaped to one side, while the frenzied\ncreatures came together like locomotives in collision.",
        "There ensued a battle royal which for sustained and frightful\nferocity transcends the power of imagination or description.\nTime and again the colossal bull tossed the enormous tiger\nhigh into the air, but each time that the huge cat touched\nthe ground he returned to the encounter with apparently\nundiminished strength, and seemingly increased ire.",
        "For a while the man and woman busied themselves only with\nkeeping out of the way of the two creatures, but finally I\nsaw them separate and each creep stealthily toward one of\nthe combatants. The tiger was now upon the bull’s broad back,\nclinging to the huge neck with powerful fangs while its long,\nstrong talons ripped the heavy hide into shreds and ribbons.",
        "For a moment the bull stood bellowing and quivering\nwith pain and rage, its cloven hoofs widespread,\nits tail lashing viciously from side to side, and then,\nin a mad orgy of bucking it went careening about the\narena in frenzied attempt to unseat its rending rider.\nIt was with difficulty that the girl avoided the first mad\nrush of the wounded animal.",
        "All its efforts to rid itself of the tiger seemed futile,\nuntil in desperation it threw itself upon the ground,\nrolling over and over. A little of this so disconcerted\nthe tiger, knocking its breath from it I imagine,\nthat it lost its hold and then, quick as a cat, the great\nthag was up again and had buried those mighty horns\ndeep in the tarag’s abdomen, pinning him to the floor\nof the arena.",
        "The great cat clawed at the shaggy head until eyes and\nears were gone, and naught but a few strips of ragged,\nbloody flesh remained upon the skull. Yet through all\nthe agony of that fearful punishment the thag still stood\nmotionless pinning down his adversary, and then the man\nleaped in, seeing that the blind bull would be the least\nformidable enemy, and ran his spear through the tarag’s heart.",
        "As the animal’s fierce clawing ceased, the bull raised\nhis gory, sightless head, and with a horrid roar ran\nheadlong across the arena. With great leaps and bounds\nhe came, straight toward the arena wall directly beneath\nwhere we sat, and then accident carried him, in one\nof his mighty springs, completely over the barrier into\nthe midst of the slaves and Sagoths just in front of us.\nSwinging his bloody horns from side to side the beast cut\na wide swath before him straight upward toward our seats.\nBefore him slaves and gorilla-men fought in mad stampede\nto escape the menace of the creature’s death agonies,\nfor such only could that frightful charge have been.",
        "Forgetful of us, our guards joined in the general\nrush for the exits, many of which pierced the wall\nof the amphitheater behind us. Perry, Ghak, and I\nbecame separated in the chaos which reigned for a few\nmoments after the beast cleared the wall of the arena,\neach intent upon saving his own hide.",
        "I ran to the right, passing several exits choked with the\nfear mad mob that were battling to escape. One would\nhave thought that an entire herd of thags was loose\nbehind them, rather than a single blinded, dying beast;\nbut such is the effect of panic upon a crowd.",
        "Once out of the direct path of the animal, fear of it\nleft me, but another emotion as quickly gripped me—hope\nof escape that the demoralized condition of the guards\nmade possible for the instant.",
        "I thought of Perry, but for the hope that I might better\nencompass his release if myself free I should have put\nthe thought of freedom from me at once. As it was I\nhastened on toward the right searching for an exit toward\nwhich no Sagoths were fleeing, and at last I found it—a low,\nnarrow aperture leading into a dark corridor.",
        "Without thought of the possible consequence, I darted into\nthe shadows of the tunnel, feeling my way along through\nthe gloom for some distance. The noises of the amphitheater\nhad grown fainter and fainter until now all was as silent\nas the tomb about me. Faint light filtered from above\nthrough occasional ventilating and lighting tubes, but it\nwas scarce sufficient to enable my human eyes to cope with\nthe darkness, and so I was forced to move with extreme care,\nfeeling my way along step by step with a hand upon the\nwall beside me.",
        "Presently the light increased and a moment later,\nto my delight, I came upon a flight of steps leading upward,\nat the top of which the brilliant light of the noonday\nsun shone through an opening in the ground.",
        "Cautiously I crept up the stairway to the tunnel’s end,\nand peering out saw the broad plain of Phutra before me.\nThe numerous lofty, granite towers which mark the several\nentrances to the subterranean city were all in front\nof me—behind, the plain stretched level and unbroken\nto the nearby foothills. I had come to the surface,\nthen, beyond the city, and my chances for escape seemed\nmuch enhanced.",
        "My first impulse was to await darkness before attempting\nto cross the plain, so deeply implanted are habits\nof thought; but of a sudden I recollected the perpetual\nnoonday brilliance which envelopes Pellucidar,\nand with a smile I stepped forth into the day-light.",
        "Rank grass, waist high, grows upon the plain of\nPhutra—the gorgeous flowering grass of the inner world,\neach particular blade of which is tipped with a tiny,\nfive-pointed blossom—brilliant little stars of varying\ncolors that twinkle in the green foliage to add still\nanother charm to the weird, yet lovely, land-scape.",
        "But then the only aspect which attracted me was the distant\nhills in which I hoped to find sanctuary, and so I hastened on,\ntrampling the myriad beauties beneath my hurrying feet.\nPerry says that the force of gravity is less upon the\nsurface of the inner world than upon that of the outer.\nHe explained it all to me once, but I was never particularly\nbrilliant in such matters and so most of it has escaped me.\nAs I recall it the difference is due in some part to the\ncounter-attraction of that portion of the earth’s crust\ndirectly opposite the spot upon the face of Pellucidar\nat which one’s calculations are being made. Be that as\nit may, it always seemed to me that I moved with greater\nspeed and agility within Pellucidar than upon the outer\nsurface—there was a certain airy lightness of step that was\nmost pleasing, and a feeling of bodily detachment which\nI can only compare with that occasionally experienced in dreams.",
        "And as I crossed Phutra’s flower-bespangled plain that time\nI seemed almost to fly, though how much of the sensation\nwas due to Perry’s suggestion and how much to actuality\nI am sure I do not know. The more I thought of Perry\nthe less pleasure I took in my new-found freedom.\nThere could be no liberty for me within Pellucidar unless\nthe old man shared it with me, and only the hope that I\nmight find some way to encompass his release kept me\nfrom turning back to Phutra.",
        "Just how I was to help Perry I could scarce imagine,\nbut I hoped that some fortuitous circumstance might solve\nthe problem for me. It was quite evident however that\nlittle less than a miracle could aid me, for what could\nI accomplish in this strange world, naked and unarmed?\nIt was even doubtful that I could retrace my steps\nto Phutra should I once pass beyond view of the plain,\nand even were that possible, what aid could I bring\nto Perry no matter how far I wandered?",
        "The case looked more and more hopeless the longer I viewed it,\nyet with a stubborn persistency I forged ahead toward\nthe foothills. Behind me no sign of pursuit developed,\nbefore me I saw no living thing. It was as though I\nmoved through a dead and forgotten world.",
        "I have no idea, of course, how long it took me to reach\nthe limit of the plain, but at last I entered the foothills,\nfollowing a pretty little canyon upward toward\nthe mountains. Beside me frolicked a laughing brooklet,\nhurrying upon its noisy way down to the silent sea.\nIn its quieter pools I discovered many small fish, of four-\nor five-pound weight I should imagine. In appearance,\nexcept as to size and color, they were not unlike the\nwhale of our own seas. As I watched them playing about\nI discovered, not only that they suckled their young,\nbut that at intervals they rose to the surface to breathe\nas well as to feed upon certain grasses and a strange,\nscarlet lichen which grew upon the rocks just above the\nwater line.",
        "It was this last habit that gave me the opportunity I\ncraved to capture one of these herbivorous cetaceans—that\nis what Perry calls them—and make as good a meal as one can\non raw, warm-blooded fish; but I had become rather used,\nby this time, to the eating of food in its natural state,\nthough I still balked on the eyes and entrails,\nmuch to the amusement of Ghak, to whom I always passed\nthese delicacies.",
        "Crouching beside the brook, I waited until one of the\ndiminutive purple whales rose to nibble at the long\ngrasses which overhung the water, and then, like the beast\nof prey that man really is, I sprang upon my victim,\nappeasing my hunger while he yet wriggled to escape.",
        "Then I drank from the clear pool, and after washing my hands\nand face continued my flight. Above the source of the brook\nI encountered a rugged climb to the summit of a long ridge.\nBeyond was a steep declivity to the shore of a placid,\ninland sea, upon the quiet surface of which lay several\nbeautiful islands.",
        "The view was charming in the extreme, and as no man or beast\nwas to be seen that might threaten my new-found liberty,\nI slid over the edge of the bluff, and half sliding,\nhalf falling, dropped into the delightful valley,\nthe very aspect of which seemed to offer a haven of peace\nand security.",
        "The gently sloping beach along which I walked was thickly\nstrewn with strangely shaped, colored shells; some empty,\nothers still housing as varied a multitude of mollusks\nas ever might have drawn out their sluggish lives along the\nsilent shores of the antediluvian seas of the outer crust.\nAs I walked I could not but compare myself with the first\nman of that other world, so complete the solitude which\nsurrounded me, so primal and untouched the virgin wonders\nand beauties of adolescent nature. I felt myself a second\nAdam wending my lonely way through the childhood of a world,\nsearching for my Eve, and at the thought there rose\nbefore my mind’s eye the exquisite outlines of a perfect\nface surmounted by a loose pile of wondrous, raven hair.",
        "As I walked, my eyes were bent upon the beach so that it\nwas not until I had come quite upon it that I discovered\nthat which shattered all my beautiful dream of solitude\nand safety and peace and primal overlordship. The thing\nwas a hollowed log drawn upon the sands, and in the bottom\nof it lay a crude paddle.",
        "The rude shock of awakening to what doubtless might prove\nsome new form of danger was still upon me when I heard\na rattling of loose stones from the direction of the bluff,\nand turning my eyes in that direction I beheld the\nauthor of the disturbance, a great copper-colored man,\nrunning rapidly toward me.",
        "There was that in the haste with which he came which\nseemed quite sufficiently menacing, so that I did\nnot need the added evidence of brandishing spear and\nscowling face to warn me that I was in no safe position,\nbut whither to flee was indeed a momentous question.",
        "The speed of the fellow seemed to preclude the possibility\nof escaping him upon the open beach. There was but a\nsingle alternative—the rude skiff—and with a celerity\nwhich equaled his, I pushed the thing into the sea and\nas it floated gave a final shove and clambered in over the end.",
        "A cry of rage rose from the owner of the primitive craft,\nand an instant later his heavy, stone-tipped spear grazed\nmy shoulder and buried itself in the bow of the boat beyond.\nThen I grasped the paddle, and with feverish haste urged\nthe awkward, wobbly thing out upon the surface of the sea.",
        "A glance over my shoulder showed me that the copper-colored\none had plunged in after me and was swimming rapidly\nin pursuit. His mighty strokes bade fair to close up\nthe distance between us in short order, for at best I\ncould make but slow progress with my unfamiliar craft,\nwhich nosed stubbornly in every direction but that which I\ndesired to follow, so that fully half my energy was\nexpended in turning its blunt prow back into the course.",
        "I had covered some hundred yards from shore when it became\nevident that my pursuer must grasp the stern of the skiff\nwithin the next half-dozen strokes. In a frenzy of despair,\nI bent to the grandfather of all paddles in a hopeless\neffort to escape, and still the copper giant behind me\ngained and gained.",
        "His hand was reaching upward for the stern when I saw a sleek,\nsinuous body shoot from the depths below. The man saw\nit too, and the look of terror that overspread his face\nassured me that I need have no further concern as to him,\nfor the fear of certain death was in his look.",
        "And then about him coiled the great, slimy folds of a\nhideous monster of that prehistoric deep—a mighty serpent\nof the sea, with fanged jaws, and darting forked tongue,\nwith bulging eyes, and bony protuberances upon head\nand snout that formed short, stout horns.",
        "As I looked at that hopeless struggle my eyes met\nthose of the doomed man, and I could have sworn\nthat in his I saw an expression of hopeless appeal.\nBut whether I did or not there swept through me a sudden\ncompassion for the fellow. He was indeed a brother-man,\nand that he might have killed me with pleasure\nhad he caught me was forgotten in the extremity of his danger.",
        "Unconsciously I had ceased paddling as the serpent rose\nto engage my pursuer, so now the skiff still drifted close\nbeside the two. The monster seemed to be but playing with his\nvictim before he closed his awful jaws upon him and dragged\nhim down to his dark den beneath the surface to devour him.\nThe huge, snakelike body coiled and uncoiled about its prey.\nThe hideous, gaping jaws snapped in the victim’s face.\nThe forked tongue, lightning-like, ran in and out upon\nthe copper skin.",
        "Nobly the giant battled for his life, beating with his\nstone hatchet against the bony armor that covered that\nfrightful carcass; but for all the damage he inflicted\nhe might as well have struck with his open palm.",
        "At last I could endure no longer to sit supinely by while\na fellowman was dragged down to a horrible death by that\nrepulsive reptile. Embedded in the prow of the skiff lay\nthe spear that had been cast after me by him whom I suddenly\ndesired to save. With a wrench I tore it loose, and standing\nupright in the wobbly log drove it with all the strength\nof my two arms straight into the gaping jaws of the hydrophidian.",
        "With a loud hiss the creature abandoned its prey to\nturn upon me, but the spear, imbedded in its throat,\nprevented it from seizing me though it came near\nto overturning the skiff in its mad efforts to reach me.",
        "The aborigine, apparently uninjured, climbed quickly into\nthe skiff, and seizing the spear with me helped to hold\noff the infuriated creature. Blood from the wounded\nreptile was now crimsoning the waters about us and soon\nfrom the weakening struggles it became evident that I\nhad inflicted a death wound upon it. Presently its\nefforts to reach us ceased entirely, and with a few\nconvulsive movements it turned upon its back quite dead.",
        "And then there came to me a sudden realization of the\npredicament in which I had placed myself. I was entirely\nwithin the power of the savage man whose skiff I had stolen.\nStill clinging to the spear I looked into his face to find\nhim scrutinizing me intently, and there we stood for some\nseveral minutes, each clinging tenaciously to the weapon\nthe while we gazed in stupid wonderment at each other.",
        "What was in his mind I do not know, but in my own was\nmerely the question as to how soon the fellow would\nrecommence hostilities.",
        "Presently he spoke to me, but in a tongue which I was\nunable to translate. I shook my head in an effort to\nindicate my ignorance of his language, at the same time\naddressing him in the bastard tongue that the Sagoths\nuse to converse with the human slaves of the Mahars.",
        "To my delight he understood and answered me in the same jargon.",
        "“What do you want of my spear?” he asked.",
        "“Only to keep you from running it through me,” I replied.",
        "“I would not do that,” he said, “for you have just saved\nmy life,” and with that he released his hold upon it\nand squatted down in the bottom of the skiff.",
        "“Who are you,” he continued, “and from what country\ndo you come?”",
        "I too sat down, laying the spear between us, and tried\nto explain how I came to Pellucidar, and wherefrom, but it\nwas as impossible for him to grasp or believe the strange\ntale I told him as I fear it is for you upon the outer\ncrust to believe in the existence of the inner world.\nTo him it seemed quite ridiculous to imagine that there\nwas another world far beneath his feet peopled by\nbeings similar to himself, and he laughed uproariously\nthe more he thought upon it. But it was ever thus.\nThat which has never come within the scope of our really\npitifully meager world-experience cannot be—our finite\nminds cannot grasp that which may not exist in accordance\nwith the conditions which obtain about us upon the outside\nof the insignificant grain of dust which wends its tiny\nway among the bowlders of the universe—the speck of moist\ndirt we so proudly call the World.",
        "So I gave it up and asked him about himself. He said he\nwas a Mezop, and that his name was Ja.",
        "“Who are the Mezops?” I asked. “Where do they live?”",
        "He looked at me in surprise.",
        "“I might indeed believe that you were from another world,\"\nhe said, “for who of Pellucidar could be so ignorant! The\nMezops live upon the islands of the seas. In so far as I\never have heard no Mezop lives elsewhere, and no others\nthan Mezops dwell upon islands, but of course it may be\ndifferent in other far-distant lands. I do not know.\nAt any rate in this sea and those near by it is true that\nonly people of my race inhabit the islands.",
        "“We are fishermen, though we be great hunters as well,\noften going to the mainland in search of the game\nthat is scarce upon all but the larger islands. And we\nare warriors also,” he added proudly. “Even the Sagoths\nof the Mahars fear us. Once, when Pellucidar was young,\nthe Sagoths were wont to capture us for slaves as they\ndo the other men of Pellucidar, it is handed down from\nfather to son among us that this is so; but we fought\nso desperately and slew so many Sagoths, and those of us\nthat were captured killed so many Mahars in their own\ncities that at last they learned that it were better\nto leave us alone, and later came the time that the\nMahars became too indolent even to catch their own fish,\nexcept for amusement, and then they needed us to supply\ntheir wants, and so a truce was made between the races.\nNow they give us certain things which we are unable\nto produce in return for the fish that we catch,\nand the Mezops and the Mahars live in peace.",
        "“The great ones even come to our islands. It is there,\nfar from the prying eyes of their own Sagoths, that they\npractice their religious rites in the temples they have\nbuilded there with our assistance. If you live among\nus you will doubtless see the manner of their worship,\nwhich is strange indeed, and most unpleasant for the poor\nslaves they bring to take part in it.”",
        "As Ja talked I had an excellent opportunity to inspect him\nmore closely. He was a huge fellow, standing I should say\nsix feet six or seven inches, well developed and of a coppery\nred not unlike that of our own North American Indian,\nnor were his features dissimilar to theirs. He had\nthe aquiline nose found among many of the higher tribes,\nthe prominent cheek bones, and black hair and eyes,\nbut his mouth and lips were better molded. All in all,\nJa was an impressive and handsome creature, and he talked\nwell too, even in the miserable makeshift language we\nwere compelled to use.",
        "During our conversation Ja had taken the paddle and was\npropelling the skiff with vigorous strokes toward a large\nisland that lay some half-mile from the mainland.\nThe skill with which he handled his crude and awkward\ncraft elicited my deepest admiration, since it had been\nso short a time before that I had made such pitiful work\nof it.",
        "As we touched the pretty, level beach Ja leaped out\nand I followed him. Together we dragged the skiff\nfar up into the bushes that grew beyond the sand.",
        "“We must hide our canoes,” explained Ja, “for the Mezops\nof Luana are always at war with us and would steal them\nif they found them,” he nodded toward an island farther\nout at sea, and at so great a distance that it seemed\nbut a blur hanging in the distant sky. The upward curve\nof the surface of Pellucidar was constantly revealing the\nimpossible to the surprised eyes of the outer-earthly. To\nsee land and water curving upward in the distance until it\nseemed to stand on edge where it melted into the distant sky,\nand to feel that seas and mountains hung suspended directly\nabove one’s head required such a complete reversal\nof the perceptive and reasoning faculties as almost to\nstupefy one.",
        "No sooner had we hidden the canoe than Ja plunged\ninto the jungle, presently emerging into a narrow but\nwell-defined trail which wound hither and thither much\nafter the manner of the highways of all primitive folk,\nbut there was one peculiarity about this Mezop trail\nwhich I was later to find distinguished them from all\nother trails that I ever have seen within or without the earth.",
        "It would run on, plain and clear and well defined to end\nsuddenly in the midst of a tangle of matted jungle, then Ja\nwould turn directly back in his tracks for a little distance,\nspring into a tree, climb through it to the other side,\ndrop onto a fallen log, leap over a low bush and alight\nonce more upon a distinct trail which he would follow back\nfor a short distance only to turn directly about and retrace\nhis steps until after a mile or less this new pathway\nended as suddenly and mysteriously as the former section.\nThen he would pass again across some media which would\nreveal no spoor, to take up the broken thread of the\ntrail beyond.",
        "As the purpose of this remarkable avenue dawned upon me I\ncould not but admire the native shrewdness of the ancient\nprogenitor of the Mezops who hit upon this novel plan to\nthrow his enemies from his track and delay or thwart them\nin their attempts to follow him to his deep-buried cities.",
        "To you of the outer earth it might seem a slow\nand tortuous method of traveling through the jungle,\nbut were you of Pellucidar you would realize that time\nis no factor where time does not exist. So labyrinthine\nare the windings of these trails, so varied the connecting\nlinks and the distances which one must retrace one’s\nsteps from the paths’ ends to find them that a Mezop\noften reaches man’s estate before he is familiar\neven with those which lead from his own city to the sea.",
        "In fact three-fourths of the education of the young\nmale Mezop consists in familiarizing himself with these\njungle avenues, and the status of an adult is largely\ndetermined by the number of trails which he can follow\nupon his own island. The females never learn them,\nsince from birth to death they never leave the clearing\nin which the village of their nativity is situated except\nthey be taken to mate by a male from another village,\nor captured in war by the enemies of their tribe.",
        "After proceeding through the jungle for what must have been\nupward of five miles we emerged suddenly into a large\nclearing in the exact center of which stood as strange\nan appearing village as one might well imagine.",
        "Large trees had been chopped down fifteen or twenty feet\nabove the ground, and upon the tops of them spherical\nhabitations of woven twigs, mud covered, had been built.\nEach ball-like house was surmounted by some manner\nof carven image, which Ja told me indicated the identity\nof the owner.",
        "Horizontal slits, six inches high and two or three\nfeet wide, served to admit light and ventilation.\nThe entrances to the house were through small apertures\nin the bases of the trees and thence upward by rude\nladders through the hollow trunks to the rooms above.\nThe houses varied in size from two to several rooms.\nThe largest that I entered was divided into two floors and\neight apartments.",
        "All about the village, between it and the jungle,\nlay beautifully cultivated fields in which the Mezops raised\nsuch cereals, fruits, and vegetables as they required.\nWomen and children were working in these gardens as we crossed\ntoward the village. At sight of Ja they saluted deferentially,\nbut to me they paid not the slightest attention.\nAmong them and about the outer verge of the cultivated area\nwere many warriors. These too saluted Ja, by touching\nthe points of their spears to the ground directly before them.",
        "Ja conducted me to a large house in the center of the\nvillage—the house with eight rooms—and taking me up\ninto it gave me food and drink. There I met his mate,\na comely girl with a nursing baby in her arms. Ja told\nher of how I had saved his life, and she was thereafter\nmost kind and hospitable toward me, even permitting me\nto hold and amuse the tiny bundle of humanity whom Ja\ntold me would one day rule the tribe, for Ja, it seemed,\nwas the chief of the community.",
        "We had eaten and rested, and I had slept, much to Ja’s\namusement, for it seemed that he seldom if ever did so,\nand then the red man proposed that I accompany him to the\ntemple of the Mahars which lay not far from his village.\n\"We are not supposed to visit it,” he said; “but the great\nones cannot hear and if we keep well out of sight they need\nnever know that we have been there. For my part I hate them\nand always have, but the other chieftains of the island\nthink it best that we continue to maintain the amicable\nrelations which exist between the two races; otherwise I\nshould like nothing better than to lead my warriors amongst\nthe hideous creatures and exterminate them—Pellucidar\nwould be a better place to live were there none of them.”",
        "I wholly concurred in Ja’s belief, but it seemed that it\nmight be a difficult matter to exterminate the dominant race\nof Pellucidar. Thus conversing we followed the intricate trail\ntoward the temple, which we came upon in a small clearing\nsurrounded by enormous trees similar to those which must\nhave flourished upon the outer crust during the carboniferous age.",
        "Here was a mighty temple of hewn rock built in the shape\nof a rough oval with rounded roof in which were several\nlarge openings. No doors or windows were visible in\nthe sides of the structure, nor was there need of any,\nexcept one entrance for the slaves, since, as Ja explained,\nthe Mahars flew to and from their place of ceremonial,\nentering and leaving the building by means of the apertures\nin the roof.",
        "“But,” added Ja, “there is an entrance near the base\nof which even the Mahars know nothing. Come,” and he\nled me across the clearing and about the end to a pile\nof loose rock which lay against the foot of the wall.\nHere he removed a couple of large bowlders, revealing a\nsmall opening which led straight within the building,\nor so it seemed, though as I entered after Ja I discovered\nmyself in a narrow place of extreme darkness.",
        "“We are within the outer wall,” said Ja. “It is hollow.\nFollow me closely.”",
        "The red man groped ahead a few paces and then began\nto ascend a primitive ladder similar to that which leads\nfrom the ground to the upper stories of his house.\nWe ascended for some forty feet when the interior of\nthe space between the walls commenced to grow lighter\nand presently we came opposite an opening in the inner\nwall which gave us an unobstructed view of the entire\ninterior of the temple.",
        "The lower floor was an enormous tank of clear water in\nwhich numerous hideous Mahars swam lazily up and down.\nArtificial islands of granite rock dotted this artificial sea,\nand upon several of them I saw men and women like myself.",
        "“What are the human beings doing here?” I asked.",
        "“Wait and you shall see,” replied Ja. “They are to take\na leading part in the ceremonies which will follow\nthe advent of the queen. You may be thankful that you\nare not upon the same side of the wall as they.”",
        "Scarcely had he spoken than we heard a great fluttering\nof wings above and a moment later a long procession\nof the frightful reptiles of Pellucidar winged slowly\nand majestically through the large central opening\nin the roof and circled in stately manner about the temple.",
        "There were several Mahars first, and then at least\ntwenty awe-inspiring pterodactyls—thipdars, they are\ncalled within Pellucidar. Behind these came the queen,\nflanked by other thipdars as she had been when she\nentered the amphitheater at Phutra.",
        "Three times they wheeled about the interior of the oval\nchamber, to settle finally upon the damp, cold bowlders\nthat fringe the outer edge of the pool. In the center\nof one side the largest rock was reserved for the queen,\nand here she took her place surrounded by her terrible guard.",
        "All lay quiet for several minutes after settling\nto their places. One might have imagined them in\nsilent prayer. The poor slaves upon the diminutive\nislands watched the horrid creatures with wide eyes.\nThe men, for the most part, stood erect and stately\nwith folded arms, awaiting their doom; but the women and\nchildren clung to one another, hiding behind the males.\nThey are a noble-looking race, these cave men of Pellucidar,\nand if our progenitors were as they, the human race\nof the outer crust has deteriorated rather than improved\nwith the march of the ages. All they lack is opportunity.\nWe have opportunity, and little else.",
        "Now the queen moved. She raised her ugly head,\nlooking about; then very slowly she crawled to the edge\nof her throne and slid noiselessly into the water.\nUp and down the long tank she swam, turning at the ends\nas you have seen captive seals turn in their tiny tanks,\nturning upon their backs and diving below the surface.",
        "Nearer and nearer to the island she came until at last she\nremained at rest before the largest, which was directly\nopposite her throne. Raising her hideous head from the\nwater she fixed her great, round eyes upon the slaves.\nThey were fat and sleek, for they had been brought from\na distant Mahar city where human beings are kept in droves,\nand bred and fattened, as we breed and fatten beef cattle.",
        "The queen fixed her gaze upon a plump young maiden.\nHer victim tried to turn away, hiding her face in her\nhands and kneeling behind a woman; but the reptile,\nwith unblinking eyes, stared on with such fixity that I\ncould have sworn her vision penetrated the woman,\nand the girl’s arms to reach at last the very center of\nher brain.",
        "Slowly the reptile’s head commenced to move to and fro,\nbut the eyes never ceased to bore toward the frightened girl,\nand then the victim responded. She turned wide,\nfear-haunted eyes toward the Mahar queen, slowly she rose\nto her feet, and then as though dragged by some unseen power\nshe moved as one in a trance straight toward the reptile,\nher glassy eyes fixed upon those of her captor.\nTo the water’s edge she came, nor did she even pause,\nbut stepped into the shallows beside the little island.\nOn she moved toward the Mahar, who now slowly retreated as though\nleading her victim on. The water rose to the girl’s knees,\nand still she advanced, chained by that clammy eye.\nNow the water was at her waist; now her armpits.\nHer fellows upon the island looked on in horror,\nhelpless to avert her doom in which they saw a forecast\nof their own.",
        "The Mahar sank now till only the long upper bill and eyes\nwere exposed above the surface of the water, and the\ngirl had advanced until the end of that repulsive beak\nwas but an inch or two from her face, her horror-filled\neyes riveted upon those of the reptile.",
        "Now the water passed above the girl’s mouth and nose—her\neyes and forehead all that showed—yet still she walked\non after the retreating Mahar. The queen’s head slowly\ndisappeared beneath the surface and after it went the\neyes of her victim—only a slow ripple widened toward\nthe shores to mark where the two vanished.",
        "For a time all was silence within the temple. The slaves\nwere motionless in terror. The Mahars watched the surface\nof the water for the reappearance of their queen,\nand presently at one end of the tank her head rose\nslowly into view. She was backing toward the surface,\nher eyes fixed before her as they had been when she\ndragged the helpless girl to her doom.",
        "And then to my utter amazement I saw the forehead\nand eyes of the maiden come slowly out of the depths,\nfollowing the gaze of the reptile just as when she had\ndisappeared beneath the surface. On and on came the girl\nuntil she stood in water that reached barely to her knees,\nand though she had been beneath the surface sufficient time\nto have drowned her thrice over there was no indication,\nother than her dripping hair and glistening body,\nthat she had been submerged at all.",
        "Again and again the queen led the girl into the depths\nand out again, until the uncanny weirdness of the thing\ngot on my nerves so that I could have leaped into the tank\nto the child’s rescue had I not taken a firm hold of myself.",
        "Once they were below much longer than usual, and when they came\nto the surface I was horrified to see that one of the girl’s\narms was gone—gnawed completely off at the shoulder—but\nthe poor thing gave no indication of realizing pain,\nonly the horror in her set eyes seemed intensified.",
        "The next time they appeared the other arm was gone,\nand then the breasts, and then a part of the face—it\nwas awful. The poor creatures on the islands awaiting\ntheir fate tried to cover their eyes with their hands\nto hide the fearful sight, but now I saw that they too\nwere under the hypnotic spell of the reptiles, so that\nthey could only crouch in terror with their eyes fixed\nupon the terrible thing that was transpiring before them.",
        "Finally the queen was under much longer than ever before,\nand when she rose she came alone and swam sleepily\ntoward her bowlder. The moment she mounted it seemed\nto be the signal for the other Mahars to enter the tank,\nand then commenced, upon a larger scale, a repetition\nof the uncanny performance through which the queen had led\nher victim.",
        "Only the women and children fell prey to the Mahars—they\nbeing the weakest and most tender—and when they had satisfied\ntheir appetite for human flesh, some of them devouring\ntwo and three of the slaves, there were only a score\nof full-grown men left, and I thought that for some reason\nthese were to be spared, but such was far from the case,\nfor as the last Mahar crawled to her rock the queen’s thipdars\ndarted into the air, circled the temple once and then,\nhissing like steam engines, swooped down upon the remaining slaves.",
        "There was no hypnotism here—just the plain, brutal ferocity\nof the beast of prey, tearing, rending, and gulping its meat,\nbut at that it was less horrible than the uncanny method of\nthe Mahars. By the time the thipdars had disposed of the last\nof the slaves the Mahars were all asleep upon their rocks,\nand a moment later the great pterodactyls swung back\nto their posts beside the queen, and themselves dropped\ninto slumber.",
        "“I thought the Mahars seldom, if ever, slept,” I said\nto Ja.",
        "“They do many things in this temple which they do not do elsewhere,\"\nhe replied. “The Mahars of Phutra are not supposed to eat\nhuman flesh, yet slaves are brought here by thousands and\nalmost always you will find Mahars on hand to consume them.\nI imagine that they do not bring their Sagoths here,\nbecause they are ashamed of the practice, which is supposed\nto obtain only among the least advanced of their race;\nbut I would wager my canoe against a broken paddle that\nthere is no Mahar but eats human flesh whenever she can get it.”",
        "“Why should they object to eating human flesh,” I asked,\n\"if it is true that they look upon us as lower animals?”",
        "“It is not because they consider us their equals that they are\nsupposed to look with abhorrence upon those who eat our flesh,\"\nreplied Ja; “it is merely that we are warm-blooded animals.\nThey would not think of eating the meat of a thag, which we\nconsider such a delicacy, any more than I would think\nof eating a snake. As a matter of fact it is difficult\nto explain just why this sentiment should exist among them.”",
        "“I wonder if they left a single victim,” I remarked,\nleaning far out of the opening in the rocky wall to\ninspect the temple better. Directly below me the water\nlapped the very side of the wall, there being a break\nin the bowlders at this point as there was at several\nother places about the side of the temple.",
        "My hands were resting upon a small piece of granite\nwhich formed a part of the wall, and all my weight upon it\nproved too much for it. It slipped and I lunged forward.\nThere was nothing to save myself and I plunged headforemost\ninto the water below.",
        "Fortunately the tank was deep at this point, and I suffered\nno injury from the fall, but as I was rising to the surface\nmy mind filled with the horrors of my position as I thought\nof the terrible doom which awaited me the moment the eyes\nof the reptiles fell upon the creature that had disturbed\ntheir slumber.",
        "As long as I could I remained beneath the surface,\nswimming rapidly in the direction of the islands that I\nmight prolong my life to the utmost. At last I was\nforced to rise for air, and as I cast a terrified glance\nin the direction of the Mahars and the thipdars I was\nalmost stunned to see that not a single one remained upon\nthe rocks where I had last seen them, nor as I searched\nthe temple with my eyes could I discern any within it.",
        "For a moment I was puzzled to account for the thing,\nuntil I realized that the reptiles, being deaf, could not\nhave been disturbed by the noise my body made when it hit\nthe water, and that as there is no such thing as time\nwithin Pellucidar there was no telling how long I had been\nbeneath the surface. It was a difficult thing to attempt\nto figure out by earthly standards—this matter of elapsed\ntime—but when I set myself to it I began to realize\nthat I might have been submerged a second or a month\nor not at all. You have no conception of the strange\ncontradictions and impossibilities which arise when all\nmethods of measuring time, as we know them upon earth,\nare non-existent.",
        "I was about to congratulate myself upon the miracle which had\nsaved me for the moment, when the memory of the hypnotic\npowers of the Mahars filled me with apprehension lest\nthey be practicing their uncanny art upon me to the end\nthat I merely imagined that I was alone in the temple.\nAt the thought cold sweat broke out upon me from every pore,\nand as I crawled from the water onto one of the tiny\nislands I was trembling like a leaf—you cannot imagine\nthe awful horror which even the simple thought of the\nrepulsive Mahars of Pellucidar induces in the human mind,\nand to feel that you are in their power—that they\nare crawling, slimy, and abhorrent, to drag you down\nbeneath the waters and devour you! It is frightful.",
        "But they did not come, and at last I came to the conclusion\nthat I was indeed alone within the temple. How long I\nshould be alone was the next question to assail me as I\nswam frantically about once more in search of a means\nto escape.",
        "Several times I called to Ja, but he must have left\nafter I tumbled into the tank, for I received no response\nto my cries. Doubtless he had felt as certain of my doom\nwhen he saw me topple from our hiding place as I had,\nand lest he too should be discovered, had hastened from\nthe temple and back to his village.",
        "I knew that there must be some entrance to the building beside\nthe doorways in the roof, for it did not seem reasonable\nto believe that the thousands of slaves which were brought\nhere to feed the Mahars the human flesh they craved would\nall be carried through the air, and so I continued my search\nuntil at last it was rewarded by the discovery of several\nloose granite blocks in the masonry at one end of the temple.",
        "A little effort proved sufficient to dislodge enough\nof these stones to permit me to crawl through into\nthe clearing, and a moment later I had scurried across\nthe intervening space to the dense jungle beyond.",
        "Here I sank panting and trembling upon the matted grasses\nbeneath the giant trees, for I felt that I had escaped\nfrom the grinning fangs of death out of the depths of my\nown grave. Whatever dangers lay hidden in this island jungle,\nthere could be none so fearsome as those which I had\njust escaped. I knew that I could meet death bravely\nenough if it but came in the form of some familiar beast\nor man—anything other than the hideous and uncanny Mahars.",
        "I must have fallen asleep from exhaustion. When I awoke\nI was very hungry, and after busying myself searching\nfor fruit for a while, I set off through the jungle to\nfind the beach. I knew that the island was not so large\nbut that I could easily find the sea if I did but move\nin a straight line, but there came the difficulty as there\nwas no way in which I could direct my course and hold it,\nthe sun, of course, being always directly above my head,\nand the trees so thickly set that I could see no distant\nobject which might serve to guide me in a straight line.",
        "As it was I must have walked for a great distance since I\nate four times and slept twice before I reached the sea,\nbut at last I did so, and my pleasure at the sight of it\nwas greatly enhanced by the chance discovery of a hidden\ncanoe among the bushes through which I had stumbled just\nprior to coming upon the beach.",
        "I can tell you that it did not take me long to pull\nthat awkward craft down to the water and shove it far\nout from shore. My experience with Ja had taught me that\nif I were to steal another canoe I must be quick about\nit and get far beyond the owner’s reach as soon as possible.",
        "I must have come out upon the opposite side of the\nisland from that at which Ja and I had entered it,\nfor the mainland was nowhere in sight. For a long time I\npaddled around the shore, though well out, before I saw\nthe mainland in the distance. At the sight of it I lost\nno time in directing my course toward it, for I had long\nsince made up my mind to return to Phutra and give myself\nup that I might be once more with Perry and Ghak the Hairy One.",
        "I felt that I was a fool ever to have attempted to\nescape alone, especially in view of the fact that our\nplans were already well formulated to make a break for\nfreedom together. Of course I realized that the chances\nof the success of our proposed venture were slim indeed,\nbut I knew that I never could enjoy freedom without\nPerry so long as the old man lived, and I had learned\nthat the probability that I might find him was less than slight.",
        "Had Perry been dead, I should gladly have pitted my\nstrength and wit against the savage and primordial world\nin which I found myself. I could have lived in seclusion\nwithin some rocky cave until I had found the means to\noutfit myself with the crude weapons of the Stone Age,\nand then set out in search of her whose image had now\nbecome the constant companion of my waking hours,\nand the central and beloved figure of my dreams.",
        "But, to the best of my knowledge, Perry still lived\nand it was my duty and wish to be again with him, that we\nmight share the dangers and vicissitudes of the strange\nworld we had discovered. And Ghak, too; the great,\nshaggy man had found a place in the hearts of us both,\nfor he was indeed every inch a man and king.\nUncouth, perhaps, and brutal, too, if judged too harshly\nby the standards of effete twentieth- century civilization,\nbut withal noble, dignified, chivalrous, and loveable.",
        "Chance carried me to the very beach upon which I\nhad discovered Ja’s canoe, and a short time later I\nwas scrambling up the steep bank to retrace my steps\nfrom the plain of Phutra. But my troubles came when I\nentered the canyon beyond the summit, for here I found\nthat several of them centered at the point where I\ncrossed the divide, and which one I had traversed\nto reach the pass I could not for the life of me remember.",
        "It was all a matter of chance and so I set off down\nthat which seemed the easiest going, and in this I made\nthe same mistake that many of us do in selecting the path\nalong which we shall follow out the course of our lives,\nand again learned that it is not always best to follow\nthe line of least resistance.",
        "By the time I had eaten eight meals and slept twice\nI was convinced that I was upon the wrong trail,\nfor between Phutra and the inland sea I had not slept\nat all, and had eaten but once. To retrace my steps\nto the summit of the divide and explore another canyon\nseemed the only solution of my problem, but a sudden\nwidening and levelness of the canyon just before me seemed\nto suggest that it was about to open into a level country,\nand with the lure of discovery strong upon me I decided\nto proceed but a short distance farther before I turned back.",
        "The next turn of the canyon brought me to its mouth,\nand before me I saw a narrow plain leading down to an ocean.\nAt my right the side of the canyon continued to the\nwater’s edge, the valley lying to my left, and the foot\nof it running gradually into the sea, where it formed\na broad level beach.",
        "Clumps of strange trees dotted the landscape here and there\nalmost to the water, and rank grass and ferns grew between.\nFrom the nature of the vegetation I was convinced that\nthe land between the ocean and the foothills was swampy,\nthough directly before me it seemed dry enough all the\nway to the sandy strip along which the restless waters\nadvanced and retreated.",
        "Curiosity prompted me to walk down to the beach,\nfor the scene was very beautiful. As I passed along\nbeside the deep and tangled vegetation of the swamp I\nthought that I saw a movement of the ferns at my left,\nbut though I stopped a moment to look it was not repeated,\nand if anything lay hid there my eyes could not penetrate\nthe dense foliage to discern it.",
        "Presently I stood upon the beach looking out over the\nwide and lonely sea across whose forbidding bosom no\nhuman being had yet ventured, to discover what strange\nand mysterious lands lay beyond, or what its invisible\nislands held of riches, wonders, or adventure.\nWhat savage faces, what fierce and formidable beasts were\nthis very instant watching the lapping of the waves upon\nits farther shore! How far did it extend? Perry had told\nme that the seas of Pellucidar were small in comparison\nwith those of the outer crust, but even so this great ocean\nmight stretch its broad expanse for thousands of miles.\nFor countless ages it had rolled up and down its countless\nmiles of shore, and yet today it remained all unknown\nbeyond the tiny strip that was visible from its beaches.",
        "The fascination of speculation was strong upon me.\nIt was as though I had been carried back to the birth\ntime of our own outer world to look upon its lands and\nseas ages before man had traversed either. Here was a\nnew world, all untouched. It called to me to explore it.\nI was dreaming of the excitement and adventure which lay\nbefore us could Perry and I but escape the Mahars,\nwhen something, a slight noise I imagine, drew my attention\nbehind me.",
        "As I turned, romance, adventure, and discovery in the\nabstract took wing before the terrible embodiment of all\nthree in concrete form that I beheld advancing upon me.",
        "A huge, slimy amphibian it was, with toad-like body and the\nmighty jaws of an alligator. Its immense carcass must have\nweighed tons, and yet it moved swiftly and silently toward me.\nUpon one hand was the bluff that ran from the canyon to the sea,\non the other the fearsome swamp from which the creature\nhad sneaked upon me, behind lay the mighty untracked sea,\nand before me in the center of the narrow way that led\nto safety stood this huge mountain of terrible and menacing flesh.",
        "A single glance at the thing was sufficient to assure me\nthat I was facing one of those long-extinct, prehistoric\ncreatures whose fossilized remains are found within\nthe outer crust as far back as the Triassic formation,\na gigantic labyrinthodon. And there I was, unarmed, and,\nwith the exception of a loin cloth, as naked as I had come\ninto the world. I could imagine how my first ancestor\nfelt that distant, prehistoric morn that he encountered\nfor the first time the terrifying progenitor of the thing\nthat had me cornered now beside the restless, mysterious sea.",
        "Unquestionably he had escaped, or I should not have been\nwithin Pellucidar or elsewhere, and I wished at that moment\nthat he had handed down to me with the various attributes\nthat I presumed I have inherited from him, the specific\napplication of the instinct of self-preservation which saved\nhim from the fate which loomed so close before me today.",
        "To seek escape in the swamp or in the ocean would have been\nsimilar to jumping into a den of lions to escape one upon\nthe outside. The sea and swamp both were doubtless alive\nwith these mighty, carnivorous amphibians, and if not,\nthe individual that menaced me would pursue me into either\nthe sea or the swamp with equal facility.",
        "There seemed nothing to do but stand supinely and await my end.\nI thought of Perry—how he would wonder what had become of me.\nI thought of my friends of the outer world, and of how they\nall would go on living their lives in total ignorance\nof the strange and terrible fate that had overtaken me,\nor unguessing the weird surroundings which had witnessed\nthe last frightful agony of my extinction. And with these\nthoughts came a realization of how unimportant to the life\nand happiness of the world is the existence of any one of us.\nWe may be snuffed out without an instant’s warning, and for\na brief day our friends speak of us with subdued voices.\nThe following morning, while the first worm is busily\nengaged in testing the construction of our coffin,\nthey are teeing up for the first hole to suffer more\nacute sorrow over a sliced ball than they did over our,\nto us, untimely demise. The labyrinthodon was coming\nmore slowly now. He seemed to realize that escape for me\nwas impossible, and I could have sworn that his huge,\nfanged jaws grinned in pleasurable appreciation of\nmy predicament, or was it in anticipation of the juicy\nmorsel which would so soon be pulp between those\nformidable teeth?",
        "He was about fifty feet from me when I heard a voice\ncalling to me from the direction of the bluff at my left.\nI looked and could have shouted in delight at the sight\nthat met my eyes, for there stood Ja, waving frantically\nto me, and urging me to run for it to the cliff’s base.",
        "I had no idea that I should escape the monster that had\nmarked me for his breakfast, but at least I should not\ndie alone. Human eyes would watch me end. It was cold\ncomfort I presume, but yet I derived some slight peace\nof mind from the contemplation of it.",
        "To run seemed ridiculous, especially toward that steep\nand unscalable cliff, and yet I did so, and as I ran I\nsaw Ja, agile as a monkey, crawl down the precipitous\nface of the rocks, clinging to small projections, and the\ntough creepers that had found root-hold here and there.",
        "The labyrinthodon evidently thought that Ja was coming\nto double his portion of human flesh, so he was in no\nhaste to pursue me to the cliff and frighten away this\nother tidbit. Instead he merely trotted along behind me.",
        "As I approached the foot of the cliff I saw what Ja intended\ndoing, but I doubted if the thing would prove successful.\nHe had come down to within twenty feet of the bottom,\nand there, clinging with one hand to a small ledge,\nand with his feet resting, precariously upon tiny bushes\nthat grew from the solid face of the rock, he lowered\nthe point of his long spear until it hung some six feet\nabove the ground.",
        "To clamber up that slim shaft without dragging Ja down\nand precipitating both to the same doom from which the\ncopper-colored one was attempting to save me seemed\nutterly impossible, and as I came near the spear I told\nJa so, and that I could not risk him to try to save myself.",
        "But he insisted that he knew what he was doing and was\nin no danger himself.",
        "“The danger is still yours,” he called, “for unless you\nmove much more rapidly than you are now, the sithic\nwill be upon you and drag you back before ever you\nare halfway up the spear—he can rear up and reach\nyou with ease anywhere below where I stand.”",
        "Well, Ja should know his own business, I thought, and so I\ngrasped the spear and clambered up toward the red man\nas rapidly as I could—being so far removed from my simian\nancestors as I am. I imagine the slow-witted sithic,\nas Ja called him, suddenly realized our intentions and\nthat he was quite likely to lose all his meal instead\nof having it doubled as he had hoped.",
        "When he saw me clambering up that spear he let out a hiss\nthat fairly shook the ground, and came charging after me\nat a terrific rate. I had reached the top of the spear\nby this time, or almost; another six inches would give\nme a hold on Ja’s hand, when I felt a sudden wrench from\nbelow and glancing fearfully downward saw the mighty jaws\nof the monster close on the sharp point of the weapon.",
        "I made a frantic effort to reach Ja’s hand, the sithic\ngave a tremendous tug that came near to jerking Ja\nfrom his frail hold on the surface of the rock,\nthe spear slipped from his fingers, and still clinging\nto it I plunged feet foremost toward my executioner.",
        "At the instant that he felt the spear come away from Ja’s\nhand the creature must have opened his huge jaws to catch me,\nfor when I came down, still clinging to the butt end\nof the weapon, the point yet rested in his mouth and the\nresult was that the sharpened end transfixed his lower jaw.",
        "With the pain he snapped his mouth closed.\nI fell upon his snout, lost my hold upon the spear,\nrolled the length of his face and head, across his\nshort neck onto his broad back and from there to the ground.",
        "Scarce had I touched the earth than I was upon my feet,\ndashing madly for the path by which I had entered this\nhorrible valley. A glance over my shoulder showed me\nthe sithic engaged in pawing at the spear stuck through\nhis lower jaw, and so busily engaged did he remain in this\noccupation that I had gained the safety of the cliff top\nbefore he was ready to take up the pursuit. When he did\nnot discover me in sight within the valley he dashed,\nhissing into the rank vegetation of the swamp and that was\nthe last I saw of him.",
        "I hastened to the cliff edge above Ja and helped him\nto a secure footing. He would not listen to any thanks\nfor his attempt to save me, which had come so near miscarrying.",
        "“I had given you up for lost when you tumbled into the\nMahar temple,” he said, “for not even I could save you from\ntheir clutches, and you may imagine my surprise when on\nseeing a canoe dragged up upon the beach of the mainland\nI discovered your own footprints in the sand beside it.",
        "“I immediately set out in search of you, knowing as I did\nthat you must be entirely unarmed and defenseless against\nthe many dangers which lurk upon the mainland both in the\nform of savage beasts and reptiles, and men as well.\nI had no difficulty in tracking you to this point.\nIt is well that I arrived when I did.”",
        "“But why did you do it?” I asked, puzzled at this show\nof friendship on the part of a man of another world\nand a different race and color.",
        "“You saved my life,” he replied; “from that moment it\nbecame my duty to protect and befriend you. I would\nhave been no true Mezop had I evaded my plain duty;\nbut it was a pleasure in this instance for I like you.\nI wish that you would come and live with me. You shall\nbecome a member of my tribe. Among us there is the best\nof hunting and fishing, and you shall have, to choose\na mate from, the most beautiful girls of Pellucidar.\nWill you come?”",
        "I told him about Perry then, and Dian the Beautiful,\nand how my duty was to them first. Afterward I should\nreturn and visit him—if I could ever find his island.",
        "“Oh, that is easy, my friend,” he said. “You need merely\nto come to the foot of the highest peak of the Mountains\nof the Clouds. There you will find a river which flows\ninto the Lural Az. Directly opposite the mouth of the\nriver you will see three large islands far out, so far\nthat they are barely discernible, the one to the extreme\nleft as you face them from the mouth of the river is Anoroc,\nwhere I rule the tribe of Anoroc.”",
        "“But how am I to find the Mountains of the Clouds?” I asked.\n\"Men say that they are visible from half Pellucidar,\"\nhe replied.",
        "“How large is Pellucidar?” I asked, wondering what sort\nof theory these primitive men had concerning the form\nand substance of their world.",
        "“The Mahars say it is round, like the inside of a tola shell,\"\nhe answered, “but that is ridiculous, since, were it true,\nwe should fall back were we to travel far in any direction,\nand all the waters of Pellucidar would run to one spot\nand drown us. No, Pellucidar is quite flat and extends\nno man knows how far in all directions. At the edges,\nso my ancestors have reported and handed down to me,\nis a great wall that prevents the earth and waters from\nescaping over into the burning sea whereon Pellucidar floats;\nbut I never have been so far from Anoroc as to have\nseen this wall with my own eyes. However, it is quite\nreasonable to believe that this is true, whereas there\nis no reason at all in the foolish belief of the Mahars.\nAccording to them Pellucidarians who live upon the opposite\nside walk always with their heads pointed downward!” and Ja\nlaughed uproariously at the very thought.",
        "It was plain to see that the human folk of this inner\nworld had not advanced far in learning, and the thought\nthat the ugly Mahars had so outstripped them was a\nvery pathetic one indeed. I wondered how many ages it\nwould take to lift these people out of their ignorance\neven were it given to Perry and me to attempt it.\nPossibly we would be killed for our pains as were those\nmen of the outer world who dared challenge the dense\nignorance and superstitions of the earth’s younger days.\nBut it was worth the effort if the opportunity ever\npresented itself.",
        "And then it occurred to me that here was an opportunity—that\nI might make a small beginning upon Ja, who was my friend,\nand thus note the effect of my teaching upon a Pellucidarian.",
        "“Ja,” I said, “what would you say were I to tell you\nthat in so far as the Mahars’ theory of the shape\nof Pellucidar is concerned it is correct?”",
        "“I would say,” he replied, “that either you are a fool,\nor took me for one.”",
        "“But, Ja,” I insisted, “if their theory is incorrect\nhow do you account for the fact that I was able to pass\nthrough the earth from the outer crust to Pellucidar.\nIf your theory is correct all is a sea of flame beneath us,\nwhere in no peoples could exist, and yet I come from a\ngreat world that is covered with human beings, and beasts,\nand birds, and fishes in mighty oceans.”",
        "“You live upon the under side of Pellucidar, and walk\nalways with your head pointed downward?” he scoffed.\n\"And were I to believe that, my friend, I should indeed\nbe mad.”",
        "I attempted to explain the force of gravity to him,\nand by the means of the dropped fruit to illustrate how\nimpossible it would be for a body to fall off the earth\nunder any circumstances. He listened so intently that I\nthought I had made an impression, and started the train\nof thought that would lead him to a partial understanding\nof the truth. But I was mistaken.",
        "“Your own illustration,” he said finally, “proves the\nfalsity of your theory.” He dropped a fruit from his hand\nto the ground. “See,” he said, “without support even this\ntiny fruit falls until it strikes something that stops it.\nIf Pellucidar were not supported upon the flaming sea it too\nwould fall as the fruit falls—you have proven it yourself!\"\nHe had me, that time—you could see it in his eye.",
        "It seemed a hopeless job and I gave it up, temporarily at least,\nfor when I contemplated the necessity explanation of our\nsolar system and the universe I realized how futile it would\nbe to attempt to picture to Ja or any other Pellucidarian\nthe sun, the moon, the planets, and the countless stars.\nThose born within the inner world could no more conceive\nof such things than can we of the outer crust reduce\nto factors appreciable to our finite minds such terms\nas space and eternity.",
        "“Well, Ja,” I laughed, “whether we be walking with our feet\nup or down, here we are, and the question of greatest\nimportance is not so much where we came from as where we\nare going now. For my part I wish that you could guide\nme to Phutra where I may give myself up to the Mahars\nonce more that my friends and I may work out the plan\nof escape which the Sagoths interrupted when they\ngathered us together and drove us to the arena to witness\nthe punishment of the slaves who killed the guardsman.\nI wish now that I had not left the arena for by this\ntime my friends and I might have made good our escape,\nwhereas this delay may mean the wrecking of all our plans,\nwhich depended for their consummation upon the continued\nsleep of the three Mahars who lay in the pit beneath\nthe building in which we were confined.”",
        "“You would return to captivity?” cried Ja.",
        "“My friends are there,” I replied, “the only friends I\nhave in Pellucidar, except yourself. What else may I\ndo under the circumstances?”",
        "He thought for a moment in silence. Then he shook his\nhead sorrowfully.",
        "“It is what a brave man and a good friend should do,\"\nhe said; “yet it seems most foolish, for the Mahars will\nmost certainly condemn you to death for running away,\nand so you will be accomplishing nothing for your friends\nby returning. Never in all my life have I heard of a\nprisoner returning to the Mahars of his own free will.\nThere are but few who escape them, though some do,\nand these would rather die than be recaptured.”",
        "“I see no other way, Ja,” I said, “though I can assure\nyou that I would rather go to Sheol after Perry\nthan to Phutra. However, Perry is much too pious\nto make the probability at all great that I should\never be called upon to rescue him from the former locality.”",
        "Ja asked me what Sheol was, and when I explained, as best\nI could, he said, “You are speaking of Molop Az, the flaming\nsea upon which Pellucidar floats. All the dead who are buried\nin the ground go there. Piece by piece they are carried\ndown to Molop Az by the little demons who dwell there.\nWe know this because when graves are opened we find that\nthe bodies have been partially or entirely borne off.\nThat is why we of Anoroc place our dead in high trees\nwhere the birds may find them and bear them bit by bit\nto the Dead World above the Land of Awful Shadow.\nIf we kill an enemy we place his body in the ground that it\nmay go to Molop Az.”",
        "As we talked we had been walking up the canyon down\nwhich I had come to the great ocean and the sithic.\nJa did his best to dissuade me from returning to Phutra,\nbut when he saw that I was determined to do so,\nhe consented to guide me to a point from which I could see\nthe plain where lay the city. To my surprise the distance\nwas but short from the beach where I had again met Ja.\nIt was evident that I had spent much time following the\nwindings of a tortuous canon, while just beyond the ridge\nlay the city of Phutra near to which I must have come\nseveral times.",
        "As we topped the ridge and saw the granite gate towers\ndotting the flowered plain at our feet Ja made a final\neffort to persuade me to abandon my mad purpose and\nreturn with him to Anoroc, but I was firm in my resolve,\nand at last he bid me good-bye, assured in his own mind\nthat he was looking upon me for the last time.",
        "I was sorry to part with Ja, for I had come to like him\nvery much indeed. With his hidden city upon the island\nof Anoroc as a base, and his savage warriors as escort\nPerry and I could have accomplished much in the line\nof exploration, and I hoped that were we successful\nin our effort to escape we might return to Anoroc later.",
        "There was, however, one great thing to be accomplished\nfirst—at least it was the great thing to me—the finding\nof Dian the Beautiful. I wanted to make amends for the\naffront I had put upon her in my ignorance, and I wanted\nto—well, I wanted to see her again, and to be with her.",
        "Down the hillside I made my way into the gorgeous field\nof flowers, and then across the rolling land toward the\nshadowless columns that guard the ways to buried Phutra.\nAt a quarter-mile from the nearest entrance I was\ndiscovered by the Sagoth guard, and in an instant four\nof the gorilla-men were dashing toward me.",
        "Though they brandished their long spears and yelled\nlike wild Comanches I paid not the slightest attention\nto them, walking quietly toward them as though unaware\nof their existence. My manner had the effect upon them\nthat I had hoped, and as we came quite near together they\nceased their savage shouting. It was evident that they\nhad expected me to turn and flee at sight of them,\nthus presenting that which they most enjoyed, a moving\nhuman target at which to cast their spears.",
        "“What do you here?” shouted one, and then as he recognized me,\n\"Ho! It is the slave who claims to be from another world—he\nwho escaped when the thag ran amuck within the amphitheater.\nBut why do you return, having once made good your escape?”",
        "“I did not ’escape’,” I replied. “I but ran away to avoid\nthe thag, as did others, and coming into a long passage\nI became confused and lost my way in the foothills\nbeyond Phutra. Only now have I found my way back.”",
        "“And you come of your free will back to Phutra!\"\nexclaimed one of the guardsmen.",
        "“Where else might I go?” I asked. “I am a stranger\nwithin Pellucidar and know no other where than Phutra.\nWhy should I not desire to be in Phutra? Am I not well fed\nand well treated? Am I not happy? What better lot could\nman desire?”",
        "The Sagoths scratched their heads. This was a new one\non them, and so being stupid brutes they took me to their\nmasters whom they felt would be better fitted to solve\nthe riddle of my return, for riddle they still considered it.",
        "I had spoken to the Sagoths as I had for the purpose\nof throwing them off the scent of my purposed attempt\nat escape. If they thought that I was so satisfied\nwith my lot within Phutra that I would voluntarily return\nwhen I had once had so excellent an opportunity to escape,\nthey would never for an instant imagine that I could\nbe occupied in arranging another escape immediately\nupon my return to the city.",
        "So they led me before a slimy Mahar who clung to a slimy\nrock within the large room that was the thing’s office.\nWith cold, reptilian eyes the creature seemed to bore through\nthe thin veneer of my deceit and read my inmost thoughts.\nIt heeded the story which the Sagoths told of my return\nto Phutra, watching the gorilla-men’s lips and fingers\nduring the recital. Then it questioned me through one of\nthe Sagoths.",
        "“You say that you returned to Phutra of your own free will,\nbecause you think yourself better off here than elsewhere—do\nyou not know that you may be the next chosen to give up\nyour life in the interests of the wonderful scientific\ninvestigations that our learned ones are continually\noccupied with?”",
        "I hadn’t heard of anything of that nature, but I thought\nbest not to admit it.",
        "“I could be in no more danger here,” I said, “than naked\nand unarmed in the savage jungles or upon the lonely\nplains of Pellucidar. I was fortunate, I think, to return\nto Phutra at all. As it was I barely escaped death within\nthe jaws of a huge sithic. No, I am sure that I am safer\nin the hands of intelligent creatures such as rule Phutra.\nAt least such would be the case in my own world, where human\nbeings like myself rule supreme. There the higher races\nof man extend protection and hospitality to the stranger\nwithin their gates, and being a stranger here I naturally\nassumed that a like courtesy would be accorded me.”",
        "The Mahar looked at me in silence for some time after I\nceased speaking and the Sagoth had translated my words\nto his master. The creature seemed deep in thought.\nPresently he communicated some message to the Sagoth.\nThe latter turned, and motioning me to follow him, left the\npresence of the reptile. Behind and on either side of me\nmarched the balance of the guard.",
        "“What are they going to do with me?” I asked the fellow\nat my right.",
        "“You are to appear before the learned ones who will\nquestion you regarding this strange world from which you\nsay you come.”",
        "After a moment’s silence he turned to me again.",
        "“Do you happen to know,” he asked, “what the Mahars\ndo to slaves who lie to them?”",
        "“No,” I replied, “nor does it interest me, as I have\nno intention of lying to the Mahars.”",
        "“Then be careful that you don’t repeat the impossible\ntale you told Sol-to-to just now—another world, indeed,\nwhere human beings rule!” he concluded in fine scorn.",
        "“But it is the truth,” I insisted. “From where else then\ndid I come? I am not of Pellucidar. Anyone with half\nan eye could see that.”",
        "“It is your misfortune then,” he remarked dryly, “that you\nmay not be judged by one with but half an eye.”",
        "“What will they do with me,” I asked, “if they do not\nhave a mind to believe me?”",
        "“You may be sentenced to the arena, or go to the pits\nto be used in research work by the learned ones,\"\nhe replied.",
        "“And what will they do with me there?” I persisted.",
        "“No one knows except the Mahars and those who go to the pits\nwith them, but as the latter never return, their knowledge\ndoes them but little good. It is said that the learned\nones cut up their subjects while they are yet alive,\nthus learning many useful things. However I should not\nimagine that it would prove very useful to him who was\nbeing cut up; but of course this is all but conjecture.\nThe chances are that ere long you will know much\nmore about it than I,” and he grinned as he spoke.\nThe Sagoths have a well-developed sense of humor.",
        "“And suppose it is the arena,” I continued; “what then?”",
        "“You saw the two who met the tarag and the thag the time\nthat you escaped?” he said.",
        "“Yes. “",
        "“Your end in the arena would be similar to what was\nintended for them,” he explained, “though of course\nthe same kinds of animals might not be employed.”",
        "“It is sure death in either event?” I asked.",
        "“What becomes of those who go below with the learned\nones I do not know, nor does any other,” he replied;\n\"but those who go to the arena may come out alive and thus\nregain their liberty, as did the two whom you saw.”",
        "“They gained their liberty? And how?”",
        "“It is the custom of the Mahars to liberate those who\nremain alive within the arena after the beasts depart\nor are killed. Thus it has happened that several mighty\nwarriors from far distant lands, whom we have captured\non our slave raids, have battled the brutes turned in upon\nthem and slain them, thereby winning their freedom.\nIn the instance which you witnessed the beasts killed\neach other, but the result was the same—the man and woman\nwere liberated, furnished with weapons, and started\non their homeward journey. Upon the left shoulder\nof each a mark was burned—the mark of the Mahars—which\nwill forever protect these two from slaving parties.”",
        "“There is a slender chance for me then if I be sent\nto the arena, and none at all if the learned ones drag\nme to the pits?”",
        "“You are quite right,” he replied; “but do not felicitate\nyourself too quickly should you be sent to the arena,\nfor there is scarce one in a thousand who comes out alive.”",
        "To my surprise they returned me to the same building in which I\nhad been confined with Perry and Ghak before my escape.\nAt the doorway I was turned over to the guards there.",
        "“He will doubtless be called before the investigators shortly,\"\nsaid he who had brought me back,” so have him in readiness.”",
        "The guards in whose hands I now found myself, upon hearing\nthat I had returned of my own volition to Phutra evidently\nfelt that it would be safe to give me liberty within\nthe building as had been the custom before I had escaped,\nand so I was told to return to whatever duty had been\nmine formerly.",
        "My first act was to hunt up Perry; whom I found poring\nas usual over the great tomes that he was supposed to be\nmerely dusting and rearranging upon new shelves.",
        "As I entered the room he glanced up and nodded pleasantly\nto me, only to resume his work as though I had never\nbeen away at all. I was both astonished and hurt at\nhis indifference. And to think that I was risking death\nto return to him purely from a sense of duty and affection!",
        "“Why, Perry!” I exclaimed, “haven’t you a word for me\nafter my long absence?”",
        "“Long absence!” he repeated in evident astonishment.\n\"What do you mean?”",
        "“Are you crazy, Perry? Do you mean to say that you\nhave not missed me since that time we were separated\nby the charging thag within the arena?”",
        "“’That time’,” he repeated. “Why man, I have but just\nreturned from the arena! You reached here almost\nas soon as I. Had you been much later I should indeed\nhave been worried, and as it is I had intended\nasking you about how you escaped the beast as soon\nas I had completed the translation of this most\ninteresting passage.”",
        "“Perry, you ARE mad,” I exclaimed. “Why, the Lord only knows\nhow long I have been away. I have been to other lands,\ndiscovered a new race of humans within Pellucidar,\nseen the Mahars at their worship in their hidden temple,\nand barely escaped with my life from them and from a\ngreat labyrinthodon that I met afterward, following my\nlong and tedious wanderings across an unknown world.\nI must have been away for months, Perry, and now you barely\nlook up from your work when I return and insist that we\nhave been separated but a moment. Is that any way to treat\na friend? I’m surprised at you, Perry, and if I’d thought\nfor a moment that you cared no more for me than this I\nshould not have returned to chance death at the hands\nof the Mahars for your sake.”",
        "The old man looked at me for a long time before he spoke.\nThere was a puzzled expression upon his wrinkled face,\nand a look of hurt sorrow in his eyes.",
        "“David, my boy,” he said, “how could you for a moment\ndoubt my love for you? There is something strange here\nthat I cannot understand. I know that I am not mad,\nand I am equally sure that you are not; but how in the\nworld are we to account for the strange hallucinations\nthat each of us seems to harbor relative to the passage\nof time since last we saw each other. You are positive\nthat months have gone by, while to me it seems equally\ncertain that not more than an hour ago I sat beside you\nin the amphitheater. Can it be that both of us are\nright and at the same time both are wrong? First tell me\nwhat time is, and then maybe I can solve our problem.\nDo you catch my meaning?”",
        "I didn’t and said so.",
        "“Yes,” continued the old man, “we are both right. To me,\nbent over my book here, there has been no lapse of time.\nI have done little or nothing to waste my energies\nand so have required neither food nor sleep, but you,\non the contrary, have walked and fought and wasted strength\nand tissue which must needs be rebuilt by nutriment\nand food, and so, having eaten and slept many times\nsince last you saw me you naturally measure the lapse\nof time largely by these acts. As a matter of fact,\nDavid, I am rapidly coming to the conviction that there\nis no such thing as time—surely there can be no time here\nwithin Pellucidar, where there are no means for measuring\nor recording time. Why, the Mahars themselves take\nno account of such a thing as time. I find here in all\ntheir literary works but a single tense, the present.\nThere seems to be neither past nor future with them.\nOf course it is impossible for our outer-earthly minds\nto grasp such a condition, but our recent experiences seem\nto demonstrate its existence.”",
        "It was too big a subject for me, and I said so, but Perry\nseemed to enjoy nothing better than speculating upon it,\nand after listening with interest to my account of the\nadventures through which I had passed he returned once more\nto the subject, which he was enlarging upon with considerable\nfluency when he was interrupted by the entrance of a Sagoth.",
        "“Come!” commanded the intruder, beckoning to me.\n\"The investigators would speak with you.”",
        "“Good-bye, Perry!” I said, clasping the old man’s hand.\n\"There may be nothing but the present and no such thing\nas time, but I feel that I am about to take a trip\ninto the hereafter from which I shall never return.\nIf you and Ghak should manage to escape I want you to\npromise me that you will find Dian the Beautiful and tell\nher that with my last words I asked her forgiveness\nfor the unintentional affront I put upon her, and that my\none wish was to be spared long enough to right the wrong\nthat I had done her.”",
        "Tears came to Perry’s eyes.",
        "“I cannot believe but that you will return, David,” he said.\n\"It would be awful to think of living out the balance of my\nlife without you among these hateful and repulsive creatures.\nIf you are taken away I shall never escape, for I feel\nthat I am as well off here as I should be anywhere within\nthis buried world. Good-bye, my boy, good-bye!” and then\nhis old voice faltered and broke, and as he hid his face\nin his hands the Sagoth guardsman grasped me roughly\nby the shoulder and hustled me from the chamber.",
        "A moment later I was standing before a dozen\nMahars—the social investigators of Phutra. They asked\nme many questions, through a Sagoth interpreter.\nI answered them all truthfully. They seemed particularly\ninterested in my account of the outer earth and the strange\nvehicle which had brought Perry and me to Pellucidar.\nI thought that I had convinced them, and after they had\nsat in silence for a long time following my examination,\nI expected to be ordered returned to my quarters.",
        "During this apparent silence they were debating through\nthe medium of strange, unspoken language the merits of\nmy tale. At last the head of the tribunal communicated\nthe result of their conference to the officer in charge\nof the Sagoth guard.",
        "“Come,” he said to me, “you are sentenced to the\nexperimental pits for having dared to insult the\nintelligence of the mighty ones with the ridiculous\ntale you have had the temerity to unfold to them.”",
        "“Do you mean that they do not believe me?” I asked,\ntotally astonished.",
        "“Believe you!” he laughed. “Do you mean to say that you\nexpected any one to believe so impossible a lie?”",
        "It was hopeless, and so I walked in silence beside my\nguard down through the dark corridors and runways toward\nmy awful doom. At a low level we came upon a number\nof lighted chambers in which we saw many Mahars engaged\nin various occupations. To one of these chambers my guard\nescorted me, and before leaving they chained me to a\nside wall. There were other humans similarly chained.\nUpon a long table lay a victim even as I was ushered\ninto the room. Several Mahars stood about the poor\ncreature holding him down so that he could not move.\nAnother, grasping a sharp knife with her three-toed\nfore foot, was laying open the victim’s chest and abdomen.\nNo anesthetic had been administered and the shrieks\nand groans of the tortured man were terrible to hear.\nThis, indeed, was vivisection with a vengeance.\nCold sweat broke out upon me as I realized that soon my turn\nwould come. And to think that where there was no such\nthing as time I might easily imagine that my suffering\nwas enduring for months before death finally released me!",
        "The Mahars had paid not the slightest attention to me\nas I had been brought into the room. So deeply immersed\nwere they in their work that I am sure they did\nnot even know that the Sagoths had entered with me.\nThe door was close by. Would that I could reach it!\nBut those heavy chains precluded any such possibility.\nI looked about for some means of escape from my bonds.\nUpon the floor between me and the Mahars lay a tiny\nsurgical instrument which one of them must have dropped.\nIt looked not unlike a button-hook, but was much smaller,\nand its point was sharpened. A hundred times in my boyhood\ndays had I picked locks with a buttonhook. Could I but\nreach that little bit of polished steel I might yet effect\nat least a temporary escape.",
        "Crawling to the limit of my chain, I found that by\nreaching one hand as far out as I could my fingers\nstill fell an inch short of the coveted instrument.\nIt was tantalizing! Stretch every fiber of my being\nas I would, I could not quite make it.",
        "At last I turned about and extended one foot toward\nthe object. My heart came to my throat! I could just\ntouch the thing! But suppose that in my effort to drag it\ntoward me I should accidentally shove it still farther\naway and thus entirely out of reach! Cold sweat broke\nout upon me from every pore. Slowly and cautiously I\nmade the effort. My toes dropped upon the cold metal.\nGradually I worked it toward me until I felt that it was\nwithin reach of my hand and a moment later I had turned\nabout and the precious thing was in my grasp.",
        "Assiduously I fell to work upon the Mahar lock that held\nmy chain. It was pitifully simple. A child might have\npicked it, and a moment later I was free. The Mahars\nwere now evidently completing their work at the table.\nOne already turned away and was examining other victims,\nevidently with the intention of selecting the next subject.",
        "Those at the table had their backs toward me. But for the\ncreature walking toward us I might have escaped that moment.\nSlowly the thing approached me, when its attention was\nattracted by a huge slave chained a few yards to my right.\nHere the reptile stopped and commenced to go over the poor\ndevil carefully, and as it did so its back turned toward me\nfor an instant, and in that instant I gave two mighty leaps\nthat carried me out of the chamber into the corridor beyond,\ndown which I raced with all the speed I could command.",
        "Where I was, or whither I was going, I knew not.\nMy only thought was to place as much distance as possible\nbetween me and that frightful chamber of torture.",
        "Presently I reduced my speed to a brisk walk, and later\nrealizing the danger of running into some new predicament,\nwere I not careful, I moved still more slowly and cautiously.\nAfter a time I came to a passage that seemed in some\nmysterious way familiar to me, and presently, chancing to\nglance within a chamber which led from the corridor I saw\nthree Mahars curled up in slumber upon a bed of skins.\nI could have shouted aloud in joy and relief. It was\nthe same corridor and the same Mahars that I had intended\nto have lead so important a role in our escape from Phutra.\nProvidence had indeed been kind to me, for the reptiles\nstill slept.",
        "My one great danger now lay in returning to the upper\nlevels in search of Perry and Ghak, but there was nothing\nelse to be done, and so I hastened upward. When I came\nto the frequented portions of the building, I found a large\nburden of skins in a corner and these I lifted to my head,\ncarrying them in such a way that ends and corners fell\ndown about my shoulders completely hiding my face.\nThus disguised I found Perry and Ghak together in the\nchamber where we had been wont to eat and sleep.",
        "Both were glad to see me, it was needless to say, though of\ncourse they had known nothing of the fate that had been\nmeted out to me by my judges. It was decided that no time\nshould now be lost before attempting to put our plan of\nescape to the test, as I could not hope to remain hidden\nfrom the Sagoths long, nor could I forever carry that bale\nof skins about upon my head without arousing suspicion.\nHowever it seemed likely that it would carry me once\nmore safely through the crowded passages and chambers\nof the upper levels, and so I set out with Perry and\nGhak—the stench of the illy cured pelts fairly choking me.",
        "Together we repaired to the first tier of corridors beneath\nthe main floor of the buildings, and here Perry and Ghak\nhalted to await me. The buildings are cut out of the solid\nlimestone formation. There is nothing at all remarkable about\ntheir architecture. The rooms are sometimes rectangular,\nsometimes circular, and again oval in shape. The corridors\nwhich connect them are narrow and not always straight.\nThe chambers are lighted by diffused sunlight reflected\nthrough tubes similar to those by which the avenues\nare lighted. The lower the tiers of chambers, the darker.\nMost of the corridors are entirely unlighted. The Mahars\ncan see quite well in semidarkness.",
        "Down to the main floor we encountered many Mahars,\nSagoths, and slaves; but no attention was paid to us as we\nhad become a part of the domestic life of the building.\nThere was but a single entrance leading from the place\ninto the avenue and this was well guarded by Sagoths—this\ndoorway alone were we forbidden to pass. It is true\nthat we were not supposed to enter the deeper corridors\nand apartments except on special occasions when we were\ninstructed to do so; but as we were considered a lower\norder without intelligence there was little reason\nto fear that we could accomplish any harm by so doing,\nand so we were not hindered as we entered the corridor\nwhich led below.",
        "Wrapped in a skin I carried three swords, and the two bows,\nand the arrows which Perry and I had fashioned.\nAs many slaves bore skin-wrapped burdens to and fro my load\nattracted no comment. Where I left Ghak and Perry there\nwere no other creatures in sight, and so I withdrew one sword\nfrom the package, and leaving the balance of the weapons\nwith Perry, started on alone toward the lower levels.",
        "Having come to the apartment in which the three Mahars slept\nI entered silently on tiptoe, forgetting that the creatures\nwere without the sense of hearing. With a quick thrust\nthrough the heart I disposed of the first but my second\nthrust was not so fortunate, so that before I could kill\nthe next of my victims it had hurled itself against the third,\nwho sprang quickly up, facing me with wide-distended jaws.\nBut fighting is not the occupation which the race\nof Mahars loves, and when the thing saw that I already\nhad dispatched two of its companions, and that my sword\nwas red with their blood, it made a dash to escape me.\nBut I was too quick for it, and so, half hopping,\nhalf flying, it scurried down another corridor with me\nclose upon its heels.",
        "Its escape meant the utter ruin of our plan, and in all\nprobability my instant death. This thought lent wings\nto my feet; but even at my best I could do no more than\nhold my own with the leaping thing before me.",
        "Of a sudden it turned into an apartment on the right\nof the corridor, and an instant later as I rushed\nin I found myself facing two of the Mahars. The one\nwho had been there when we entered had been occupied\nwith a number of metal vessels, into which had been put\npowders and liquids as I judged from the array of flasks\nstanding about upon the bench where it had been working.\nIn an instant I realized what I had stumbled upon.\nIt was the very room for the finding of which Perry had\ngiven me minute directions. It was the buried chamber\nin which was hidden the Great Secret of the race of Mahars.\nAnd on the bench beside the flasks lay the skin-bound book\nwhich held the only copy of the thing I was to have sought,\nafter dispatching the three Mahars in their sleep.",
        "There was no exit from the room other than the doorway\nin which I now stood facing the two frightful reptiles.\nCornered, I knew that they would fight like demons,\nand they were well equipped to fight if fight they must.\nTogether they launched themselves upon me, and though I ran\none of them through the heart on the instant, the other\nfastened its gleaming fangs about my sword arm above\nthe elbow, and then with her sharp talons commenced to rake\nme about the body, evidently intent upon disemboweling me.\nI saw that it was useless to hope that I might release\nmy arm from that powerful, viselike grip which seemed\nto be severing my arm from my body. The pain I suffered\nwas intense, but it only served to spur me to greater\nefforts to overcome my antagonist.",
        "Back and forth across the floor we struggled—the Mahar\ndealing me terrific, cutting blows with her fore feet,\nwhile I attempted to protect my body with my left hand,\nat the same time watching for an opportunity to transfer\nmy blade from my now useless sword hand to its rapidly\nweakening mate. At last I was successful, and with what\nseemed to me my last ounce of strength I ran the blade\nthrough the ugly body of my foe.",
        "Soundless, as it had fought, it died, and though weak from\npain and loss of blood, it was with an emotion of triumphant\npride that I stepped across its convulsively stiffening\ncorpse to snatch up the most potent secret of a world.\nA single glance assured me it was the very thing that\nPerry had described to me.",
        "And as I grasped it did I think of what it meant to the\nhuman race of Pellucidar—did there flash through my\nmind the thought that countless generations of my own\nkind yet unborn would have reason to worship me for the\nthing that I had accomplished for them? I did not.\nI thought of a beautiful oval face, gazing out of\nlimpid eyes, through a waving mass of jet-black hair.\nI thought of red, red lips, God-made for kissing.\nAnd of a sudden, apropos of nothing, standing there\nalone in the secret chamber of the Mahars of Pellucidar,\nI realized that I loved Dian the Beautiful.",
        "For an instant I stood there thinking of her, and then,\nwith a sigh, I tucked the book in the thong that supported\nmy loin cloth, and turned to leave the apartment.\nAt the bottom of the corridor which leads aloft from\nthe lower chambers I whistled in accordance with the\nprearranged signal which was to announce to Perry and Ghak\nthat I had been successful. A moment later they stood\nbeside me, and to my surprise I saw that Hooja the Sly\nOne accompanied them.",
        "“He joined us,” explained Perry, “and would not be denied.\nThe fellow is a fox. He scents escape, and rather than\nbe thwarted of our chance now I told him that I would\nbring him to you, and let you decide whether he might\naccompany us.”",
        "I had no love for Hooja, and no confidence in him.\nI was sure that if he thought it would profit him he would\nbetray us; but I saw no way out of it now, and the fact\nthat I had killed four Mahars instead of only the three I\nhad expected to, made it possible to include the fellow\nin our scheme of escape.",
        "“Very well,” I said, “you may come with us, Hooja; but at\nthe first intimation of treachery I shall run my sword\nthrough you. Do you understand?”",
        "He said that he did.",
        "Some time later we had removed the skins from the four Mahars,\nand so succeeded in crawling inside of them ourselves\nthat there seemed an excellent chance for us to pass\nunnoticed from Phutra. It was not an easy thing to fasten\nthe hides together where we had split them along the belly\nto remove them from their carcasses, but by remaining\nout until the others had all been sewed in with my help,\nand then leaving an aperture in the breast of Perry’s\nskin through which he could pass his hands to sew me up,\nwe were enabled to accomplish our design to really much\nbetter purpose than I had hoped. We managed to keep the\nheads erect by passing our swords up through the necks,\nand by the same means were enabled to move them about in\na life-like manner. We had our greatest difficulty with\nthe webbed feet, but even that problem was finally solved,\nso that when we moved about we did so quite naturally.\nTiny holes punctured in the baggy throats into which our\nheads were thrust permitted us to see well enough to guide\nour progress.",
        "Thus we started up toward the main floor of the building.\nGhak headed the strange procession, then came Perry,\nfollowed by Hooja, while I brought up the rear,\nafter admonishing Hooja that I had so arranged my sword\nthat I could thrust it through the head of my disguise into\nhis vitals were he to show any indication of faltering.",
        "As the noise of hurrying feet warned me that we were\nentering the busy corridors of the main level, my heart\ncame up into my mouth. It is with no sense of shame that I\nadmit that I was frightened—never before in my life,\nnor since, did I experience any such agony of soulsearing\nfear and suspense as enveloped me. If it be possible\nto sweat blood, I sweat it then.",
        "Slowly, after the manner of locomotion habitual to\nthe Mahars, when they are not using their wings, we crept\nthrough throngs of busy slaves, Sagoths, and Mahars.\nAfter what seemed an eternity we reached the outer door\nwhich leads into the main avenue of Phutra. Many Sagoths\nloitered near the opening. They glanced at Ghak as he\npadded between them. Then Perry passed, and then Hooja.\nNow it was my turn, and then in a sudden fit of freezing\nterror I realized that the warm blood from my wounded arm\nwas trickling down through the dead foot of the Mahar skin\nI wore and leaving its tell-tale mark upon the pavement,\nfor I saw a Sagoth call a companion’s attention to it.",
        "The guard stepped before me and pointing to my bleeding\nfoot spoke to me in the sign language which these two\nraces employ as a means of communication. Even had I\nknown what he was saying I could not have replied\nwith the dead thing that covered me. I once had seen\na great Mahar freeze a presumptuous Sagoth with a look.\nIt seemed my only hope, and so I tried it. Stopping in\nmy tracks I moved my sword so that it made the dead head\nappear to turn inquiring eyes upon the gorilla-man. For\na long moment I stood perfectly still, eyeing the fellow\nwith those dead eyes. Then I lowered the head and started\nslowly on. For a moment all hung in the balance,\nbut before I touched him the guard stepped to one side,\nand I passed on out into the avenue.",
        "On we went up the broad street, but now we were safe\nfor the very numbers of our enemies that surrounded us\non all sides. Fortunately, there was a great concourse\nof Mahars repairing to the shallow lake which lies a mile\nor more from the city. They go there to indulge their\namphibian proclivities in diving for small fish, and enjoying\nthe cool depths of the water. It is a fresh-water lake,\nshallow, and free from the larger reptiles which make the use\nof the great seas of Pellucidar impossible for any but their\nown kind.",
        "In the thick of the crowd we passed up the steps and out\nonto the plain. For some distance Ghak remained with the\nstream that was traveling toward the lake, but finally,\nat the bottom of a little gully he halted, and there we\nremained until all had passed and we were alone. Then,\nstill in our disguises, we set off directly away from Phutra.",
        "The heat of the vertical rays of the sun was fast\nmaking our horrible prisons unbearable, so that after\npassing a low divide, and entering a sheltering forest,\nwe finally discarded the Mahar skins that had brought\nus thus far in safety.",
        "I shall not weary you with the details of that bitter\nand galling flight. How we traveled at a dogged run until\nwe dropped in our tracks. How we were beset by strange\nand terrible beasts. How we barely escaped the cruel fangs\nof lions and tigers the size of which would dwarf into\npitiful insignificance the greatest felines of the outer world.",
        "On and on we raced, our one thought to put as much\ndistance between ourselves and Phutra as possible.\nGhak was leading us to his own land—the land of Sari.\nNo sign of pursuit had developed, and yet we were sure\nthat somewhere behind us relentless Sagoths were dogging\nour tracks. Ghak said they never failed to hunt down\ntheir quarry until they had captured it or themselves been\nturned back by a superior force.",
        "Our only hope, he said, lay in reaching his tribe\nwhich was quite strong enough in their mountain fastness\nto beat off any number of Sagoths.",
        "At last, after what seemed months, and may, I now realize,\nhave been years, we came in sight of the dun escarpment\nwhich buttressed the foothills of Sari. At almost\nthe same instant, Hooja, who looked ever quite as much\nbehind as before, announced that he could see a body\nof men far behind us topping a low ridge in our wake.\nIt was the long-expected pursuit.",
        "I asked Ghak if we could make Sari in time to escape them.",
        "“We may,” he replied; “but you will find that the\nSagoths can move with incredible swiftness, and as they\nare almost tireless they are doubtless much fresher\nthan we. Then—” he paused, glancing at Perry.",
        "I knew what he meant. The old man was exhausted.\nFor much of the period of our flight either Ghak or I had\nhalf supported him on the march. With such a handicap,\nless fleet pursuers than the Sagoths might easily\novertake us before we could scale the rugged heights\nwhich confronted us.",
        "“You and Hooja go on ahead,” I said. “Perry and I will make\nit if we are able. We cannot travel as rapidly as you two,\nand there is no reason why all should be lost because\nof that. It can’t be helped—we have simply to face it.”",
        "“I will not desert a companion,” was Ghak’s simple reply.\nI hadn’t known that this great, hairy, primeval man had\nany such nobility of character stowed away inside him.\nI had always liked him, but now to my liking was added honor\nand respect. Yes, and love.",
        "But still I urged him to go on ahead, insisting that if he\ncould reach his people he might be able to bring out\na sufficient force to drive off the Sagoths and rescue\nPerry and myself.",
        "No, he wouldn’t leave us, and that was all there was to it,\nbut he suggested that Hooja might hurry on and warn\nthe Sarians of the king’s danger. It didn’t require much\nurging to start Hooja—the naked idea was enough to send\nhim leaping on ahead of us into the foothills which we\nnow had reached.",
        "Perry realized that he was jeopardizing Ghak’s life and mine\nand the old fellow fairly begged us to go on without him,\nalthough I knew that he was suffering a perfect anguish\nof terror at the thought of falling into the hands of\nthe Sagoths. Ghak finally solved the problem, in part,\nby lifting Perry in his powerful arms and carrying him.\nWhile the act cut down Ghak’s speed he still could travel\nfaster thus than when half supporting the stumbling\nold man.",
        "The Sagoths were gaining on us rapidly, for once they\nhad sighted us they had greatly increased their speed.\nOn and on we stumbled up the narrow canyon that Ghak had\nchosen to approach the heights of Sari. On either side\nrose precipitous cliffs of gorgeous, parti-colored rock,\nwhile beneath our feet a thick mountain grass formed a soft\nand noiseless carpet. Since we had entered the canyon we\nhad had no glimpse of our pursuers, and I was commencing\nto hope that they had lost our trail and that we would\nreach the now rapidly nearing cliffs in time to scale them\nbefore we should be overtaken.",
        "Ahead we neither saw nor heard any sign which might\nbetoken the success of Hooja’s mission. By now he\nshould have reached the outposts of the Sarians, and we\nshould at least hear the savage cries of the tribesmen\nas they swarmed to arms in answer to their king’s appeal\nfor succor. In another moment the frowning cliffs ahead\nshould be black with primeval warriors. But nothing\nof the kind happened—as a matter of fact the Sly One\nhad betrayed us. At the moment that we expected to see\nSarian spearmen charging to our relief at Hooja’s back,\nthe craven traitor was sneaking around the outskirts\nof the nearest Sarian village, that he might come up\nfrom the other side when it was too late to save us,\nclaiming that he had become lost among the mountains.",
        "Hooja still harbored ill will against me because of the blow\nI had struck in Dian’s protection, and his malevolent spirit\nwas equal to sacrificing us all that he might be revenged upon me.",
        "As we drew nearer the barrier cliffs and no sign of rescuing\nSarians appeared Ghak became both angry and alarmed,\nand presently as the sound of rapidly approaching pursuit\nfell upon our ears, he called to me over his shoulder\nthat we were lost.",
        "A backward glance gave me a glimpse of the first of\nthe Sagoths at the far end of a considerable stretch\nof canyon through which we had just passed, and then\na sudden turning shut the ugly creature from my view;\nbut the loud howl of triumphant rage which rose behind\nus was evidence that the gorilla-man had sighted us.",
        "Again the canyon veered sharply to the left, but to the\nright another branch ran on at a lesser deviation from\nthe general direction, so that appeared more like the main\ncanyon than the lefthand branch. The Sagoths were now\nnot over two hundred and fifty yards behind us, and I saw\nthat it was hopeless for us to expect to escape other than\nby a ruse. There was a bare chance of saving Ghak and Perry,\nand as I reached the branching of the canyon I took the chance.",
        "Pausing there I waited until the foremost Sagoth hove\ninto sight. Ghak and Perry had disappeared around a bend\nin the left-hand canyon, and as the Sagoth’s savage\nyell announced that he had seen me I turned and fled\nup the right-hand branch. My ruse was successful,\nand the entire party of man-hunters raced headlong after\nme up one canyon while Ghak bore Perry to safety up the other.",
        "Running has never been my particular athletic forte,\nand now when my very life depended upon fleetness of foot\nI cannot say that I ran any better than on the occasions\nwhen my pitiful base running had called down upon my head\nthe rooter’s raucous and reproachful cries of “Ice Wagon,\"\nand “Call a cab.”",
        "The Sagoths were gaining on me rapidly. There was\none in particular, fleeter than his fellows, who was\nperilously close. The canyon had become a rocky slit,\nrising roughly at a steep angle toward what seemed a pass\nbetween two abutting peaks. What lay beyond I could\nnot even guess—possibly a sheer drop of hundreds of feet\ninto the corresponding valley upon the other side.\nCould it be that I had plunged into a cul-de-sac?",
        "Realizing that I could not hope to outdistance the Sagoths\nto the top of the canyon I had determined to risk all\nin an attempt to check them temporarily, and to this\nend had unslung my rudely made bow and plucked an arrow\nfrom the skin quiver which hung behind my shoulder.\nAs I fitted the shaft with my right hand I stopped\nand wheeled toward the gorilla-man.",
        "In the world of my birth I never had drawn a shaft,\nbut since our escape from Phutra I had kept the party\nsupplied with small game by means of my arrows, and so,\nthrough necessity, had developed a fair degree of accuracy.\nDuring our flight from Phutra I had restrung my bow with a piece\nof heavy gut taken from a huge tiger which Ghak and I had\nworried and finally dispatched with arrows, spear, and sword.\nThe hard wood of the bow was extremely tough and this,\nwith the strength and elasticity of my new string,\ngave me unwonted confidence in my weapon.",
        "Never had I greater need of steady nerves than then—never\nwere my nerves and muscles under better control.\nI sighted as carefully and deliberately as though at\na straw target. The Sagoth had never before seen a bow\nand arrow, but of a sudden it must have swept over his dull\nintellect that the thing I held toward him was some sort\nof engine of destruction, for he too came to a halt,\nsimultaneously swinging his hatchet for a throw.\nIt is one of the many methods in which they employ\nthis weapon, and the accuracy of aim which they achieve,\neven under the most unfavorable circumstances, is little\nshort of miraculous.",
        "My shaft was drawn back its full length—my eye had centered\nits sharp point upon the left breast of my adversary;\nand then he launched his hatchet and I released my arrow.\nAt the instant that our missiles flew I leaped to one side,\nbut the Sagoth sprang forward to follow up his attack\nwith a spear thrust. I felt the swish of the hatchet\nat it grazed my head, and at the same instant my shaft\npierced the Sagoth’s savage heart, and with a single groan\nhe lunged almost at my feet—stone dead. Close behind\nhim were two more—fifty yards perhaps—but the distance\ngave me time to snatch up the dead guardsman’s shield,\nfor the close call his hatchet had just given me had borne\nin upon me the urgent need I had for one. Those which I\nhad purloined at Phutra we had not been able to bring along\nbecause their size precluded our concealing them within\nthe skins of the Mahars which had brought us safely from\nthe city.",
        "With the shield slipped well up on my left arm I let fly\nwith another arrow, which brought down a second Sagoth,\nand then as his fellow’s hatchet sped toward me I caught\nit upon the shield, and fitted another shaft for him;\nbut he did not wait to receive it. Instead, he turned and\nretreated toward the main body of gorilla-men. Evidently he\nhad seen enough of me for the moment.",
        "Once more I took up my flight, nor were the Sagoths\napparently overanxious to press their pursuit so closely\nas before. Unmolested I reached the top of the canyon\nwhere I found a sheer drop of two or three hundred feet\nto the bottom of a rocky chasm; but on the left a narrow\nledge rounded the shoulder of the overhanging cliff.\nAlong this I advanced, and at a sudden turning,\na few yards beyond the canyon’s end, the path widened,\nand at my left I saw the opening to a large cave.\nBefore, the ledge continued until it passed from sight\nabout another projecting buttress of the mountain.",
        "Here, I felt, I could defy an army, for but a single\nfoeman could advance upon me at a time, nor could he know\nthat I was awaiting him until he came full upon me around\nthe corner of the turn. About me lay scattered stones\ncrumbled from the cliff above. They were of various\nsizes and shapes, but enough were of handy dimensions\nfor use as ammunition in lieu of my precious arrows.\nGathering a number of stones into a little pile beside\nthe mouth of the cave I waited the advance of the Sagoths.",
        "As I stood there, tense and silent, listening for the\nfirst faint sound that should announce the approach\nof my enemies, a slight noise from within the cave’s\nblack depths attracted my attention. It might have\nbeen produced by the moving of the great body of some\nhuge beast rising from the rock floor of its lair.\nAt almost the same instant I thought that I caught the\nscraping of hide sandals upon the ledge beyond the turn.\nFor the next few seconds my attention was considerably divided.",
        "And then from the inky blackness at my right I saw two\nflaming eyes glaring into mine. They were on a level\nthat was over two feet above my head. It is true that the\nbeast who owned them might be standing upon a ledge within\nthe cave, or that it might be rearing up upon its hind legs;\nbut I had seen enough of the monsters of Pellucidar to know\nthat I might be facing some new and frightful Titan whose\ndimensions and ferocity eclipsed those of any I had seen before.",
        "Whatever it was, it was coming slowly toward the entrance\nof the cave, and now, deep and forbidding, it uttered a low\nand ominous growl. I waited no longer to dispute possession\nof the ledge with the thing which owned that voice.\nThe noise had not been loud—I doubt if the Sagoths heard\nit at all—but the suggestion of latent possibilities\nbehind it was such that I knew it would only emanate\nfrom a gigantic and ferocious beast.",
        "As I backed along the ledge I soon was past the mouth\nof the cave, where I no longer could see those fearful\nflaming eyes, but an instant later I caught sight of the\nfiendish face of a Sagoth as it warily advanced beyond\nthe cliff’s turn on the far side of the cave’s mouth.\nAs the fellow saw me he leaped along the ledge in pursuit,\nand after him came as many of his companions as could\ncrowd upon each other’s heels. At the same time the beast\nemerged from the cave, so that he and the Sagoths came\nface to face upon that narrow ledge.",
        "The thing was an enormous cave bear, rearing its colossal\nbulk fully eight feet at the shoulder, while from the tip\nof its nose to the end of its stubby tail it was fully twelve\nfeet in length. As it sighted the Sagoths it emitted a most\nfrightful roar, and with open mouth charged full upon them.\nWith a cry of terror the foremost gorilla-man turned to escape,\nbut behind him he ran full upon his on-rushing companions.",
        "The horror of the following seconds is indescribable.\nThe Sagoth nearest the cave bear, finding his escape\nblocked, turned and leaped deliberately to an awful\ndeath upon the jagged rocks three hundred feet below.\nThen those giant jaws reached out and gathered in the\nnext—there was a sickening sound of crushing bones,\nand the mangled corpse was dropped over the cliff’s edge.\nNor did the mighty beast even pause in his steady advance\nalong the ledge.",
        "Shrieking Sagoths were now leaping madly over the precipice\nto escape him, and the last I saw he rounded the turn still\npursuing the demoralized remnant of the man hunters.\nFor a long time I could hear the horrid roaring of the brute\nintermingled with the screams and shrieks of his victims,\nuntil finally the awful sounds dwindled and disappeared\nin the distance.",
        "Later I learned from Ghak, who had finally come to his\ntribesmen and returned with a party to rescue me,\nthat the ryth, as it is called, pursued the Sagoths until\nit had exterminated the entire band. Ghak was, of course,\npositive that I had fallen prey to the terrible creature,\nwhich, within Pellucidar, is truly the king of beasts.",
        "Not caring to venture back into the canyon, where I\nmight fall prey either to the cave bear or the Sagoths I\ncontinued on along the ledge, believing that by following\naround the mountain I could reach the land of Sari from\nanother direction. But I evidently became confused by the\ntwisting and turning of the canyons and gullies, for I did\nnot come to the land of Sari then, nor for a long time thereafter.",
        "With no heavenly guide, it is little wonder that I became confused\nand lost in the labyrinthine maze of those mighty hills.\nWhat, in reality, I did was to pass entirely through them\nand come out above the valley upon the farther side.\nI know that I wandered for a long time, until tired and\nhungry I came upon a small cave in the face of the limestone\nformation which had taken the place of the granite farther back.",
        "The cave which took my fancy lay halfway up the precipitous\nside of a lofty cliff. The way to it was such that I\nknew no extremely formidable beast could frequent it,\nnor was it large enough to make a comfortable habitat\nfor any but the smaller mammals or reptiles. Yet it\nwas with the utmost caution that I crawled within its\ndark interior.",
        "Here I found a rather large chamber, lighted by a\nnarrow cleft in the rock above which let the sunlight\nfilter in in sufficient quantities partially to dispel\nthe utter darkness which I had expected. The cave was\nentirely empty, nor were there any signs of its having been\nrecently occupied. The opening was comparatively small,\nso that after considerable effort I was able to lug\nup a bowlder from the valley below which entirely blocked it.",
        "Then I returned again to the valley for an armful of grasses\nand on this trip was fortunate enough to knock over\nan orthopi, the diminutive horse of Pellucidar, a little\nanimal about the size of a fox terrier, which abounds\nin all parts of the inner world. Thus, with food\nand bedding I returned to my lair, where after a meal\nof raw meat, to which I had now become quite accustomed,\nI dragged the bowlder before the entrance and curled\nmyself upon a bed of grasses—a naked, primeval, cave man,\nas savagely primitive as my prehistoric progenitors.",
        "I awoke rested but hungry, and pushing the bowlder aside\ncrawled out upon the little rocky shelf which was my\nfront porch. Before me spread a small but beautiful valley,\nthrough the center of which a clear and sparkling river\nwound its way down to an inland sea, the blue waters\nof which were just visible between the two mountain ranges\nwhich embraced this little paradise. The sides of the\nopposite hills were green with verdure, for a great forest\nclothed them to the foot of the red and yellow and copper\ngreen of the towering crags which formed their summit.\nThe valley itself was carpeted with a luxuriant grass,\nwhile here and there patches of wild flowers made great\nsplashes of vivid color against the prevailing green.",
        "Dotted over the face of the valley were little clusters\nof palmlike trees—three or four together as a rule.\nBeneath these stood antelope, while others grazed in the open,\nor wandered gracefully to a near-by ford to drink.\nThere were several species of this beautiful animal,\nthe most magnificent somewhat resembling the giant eland\nof Africa, except that their spiral horns form a complete\ncurve backward over their ears and then forward again\nbeneath them, ending in sharp and formidable points\nsome two feet before the face and above the eyes.\nIn size they remind one of a pure bred Hereford bull,\nyet they are very agile and fast. The broad yellow bands\nthat stripe the dark roan of their coats made me take\nthem for zebra when I first saw them. All in all they\nare handsome animals, and added the finishing touch\nto the strange and lovely landscape that spread before my\nnew home.",
        "I had determined to make the cave my headquarters,\nand with it as a base make a systematic exploration\nof the surrounding country in search of the land\nof Sari. First I devoured the remainder of the carcass\nof the orthopi I had killed before my last sleep.\nThen I hid the Great Secret in a deep niche at the back\nof my cave, rolled the bowlder before my front door,\nand with bow, arrows, sword, and shield scrambled down\ninto the peaceful valley.",
        "The grazing herds moved to one side as I passed through them,\nthe little orthopi evincing the greatest wariness and\ngalloping to safest distances. All the animals stopped\nfeeding as I approached, and after moving to what they\nconsidered a safe distance stood contemplating me with\nserious eyes and up-cocked ears. Once one of the old bull\nantelopes of the striped species lowered his head and\nbellowed angrily—even taking a few steps in my direction,\nso that I thought he meant to charge; but after I had passed,\nhe resumed feeding as though nothing had disturbed him.",
        "Near the lower end of the valley I passed a number of tapirs,\nand across the river saw a great sadok, the enormous\ndouble-horned progenitor of the modern rhinoceros.\nAt the valley’s end the cliffs upon the left ran\nout into the sea, so that to pass around them as I\ndesired to do it was necessary to scale them in search\nof a ledge along which I might continue my journey.\nSome fifty feet from the base I came upon a projection\nwhich formed a natural path along the face of the cliff,\nand this I followed out over the sea toward the cliff’s end.",
        "Here the ledge inclined rapidly upward toward the top\nof the cliffs—the stratum which formed it evidently having\nbeen forced up at this steep angle when the mountains\nbehind it were born. As I climbed carefully up the ascent\nmy attention suddenly was attracted aloft by the sound\nof strange hissing, and what resembled the flapping of wings.",
        "And at the first glance there broke upon my horrified vision\nthe most frightful thing I had seen even within Pellucidar.\nIt was a giant dragon such as is pictured in the legends\nand fairy tales of earth folk. Its huge body must have\nmeasured forty feet in length, while the batlike wings\nthat supported it in midair had a spread of fully thirty.\nIts gaping jaws were armed with long, sharp teeth,\nand its claw equipped with horrible talons.",
        "The hissing noise which had first attracted my attention\nwas issuing from its throat, and seemed to be directed\nat something beyond and below me which I could not see.\nThe ledge upon which I stood terminated abruptly a few\npaces farther on, and as I reached the end I saw the cause\nof the reptile’s agitation.",
        "Some time in past ages an earthquake had produced a fault\nat this point, so that beyond the spot where I stood\nthe strata had slipped down a matter of twenty feet.\nThe result was that the continuation of my ledge lay twenty\nfeet below me, where it ended as abruptly as did the end\nupon which I stood.",
        "And here, evidently halted in flight by this insurmountable\nbreak in the ledge, stood the object of the creature’s\nattack—a girl cowering upon the narrow platform,\nher face buried in her arms, as though to shut out the\nsight of the frightful death which hovered just above her.",
        "The dragon was circling lower, and seemed about to dart\nin upon its prey. There was no time to be lost,\nscarce an instant in which to weigh the possible\nchances that I had against the awfully armed creature;\nbut the sight of that frightened girl below me called\nout to all that was best in me, and the instinct for\nprotection of the other sex, which nearly must have\nequaled the instinct of self-preservation in primeval man,\ndrew me to the girl’s side like an irresistible magnet.",
        "Almost thoughtless of the consequences, I leaped from\nthe end of the ledge upon which I stood, for the tiny\nshelf twenty feet below. At the same instant the dragon\ndarted in toward the girl, but my sudden advent upon the\nscene must have startled him for he veered to one side,\nand then rose above us once more.",
        "The noise I made as I landed beside her convinced the girl\nthat the end had come, for she thought I was the dragon;\nbut finally when no cruel fangs closed upon her she\nraised her eyes in astonishment. As they fell upon me\nthe expression that came into them would be difficult\nto describe; but her feelings could scarcely have been\none whit more complicated than my own—for the wide eyes\nthat looked into mine were those of Dian the Beautiful.",
        "“Dian!” I cried. “Dian! Thank God that I came in time.”",
        "“You?” she whispered, and then she hid her face again;\nnor could I tell whether she were glad or angry that I\nhad come.",
        "Once more the dragon was sweeping toward us, and so rapidly\nthat I had no time to unsling my bow. All that I could\ndo was to snatch up a rock, and hurl it at the thing’s\nhideous face. Again my aim was true, and with a hiss\nof pain and rage the reptile wheeled once more and soared away.",
        "Quickly I fitted an arrow now that I might be ready\nat the next attack, and as I did so I looked down at\nthe girl, so that I surprised her in a surreptitious\nglance which she was stealing at me; but immediately,\nshe again covered her face with her hands.",
        "“Look at me, Dian,” I pleaded. “Are you not glad to see me?”",
        "She looked straight into my eyes.",
        "“I hate you,” she said, and then, as I was about to beg\nfor a fair hearing she pointed over my shoulder.\n\"The thipdar comes,” she said, and I turned again to meet\nthe reptile.",
        "So this was a thipdar. I might have known it. The cruel\nbloodhound of the Mahars. The long-extinct pterodactyl\nof the outer world. But this time I met it with a weapon it\nnever had faced before. I had selected my longest arrow,\nand with all my strength had bent the bow until the very\ntip of the shaft rested upon the thumb of my left hand,\nand then as the great creature darted toward us I let\ndrive straight for that tough breast.",
        "Hissing like the escape valve of a steam engine,\nthe mighty creature fell turning and twisting into the\nsea below, my arrow buried completely in its carcass.\nI turned toward the girl. She was looking past me.\nIt was evident that she had seen the thipdar die.",
        "“Dian,” I said, “won’t you tell me that you are not sorry\nthat I have found you?”",
        "“I hate you,” was her only reply; but I imagined\nthat there was less vehemence in it than before—yet\nit might have been but my imagination.",
        "“Why do you hate me, Dian?” I asked, but she did not\nanswer me.",
        "“What are you doing here?” I asked, “and what has happened\nto you since Hooja freed you from the Sagoths?”",
        "At first I thought that she was going to ignore me entirely,\nbut finally she thought better of it.",
        "“I was again running away from Jubal the Ugly One,\"\nshe said. “After I escaped from the Sagoths I made my way\nalone back to my own land; but on account of Jubal I did\nnot dare enter the villages or let any of my friends know\nthat I had returned for fear that Jubal might find out.\nBy watching for a long time I found that my brother\nhad not yet returned, and so I continued to live in a\ncave beside a valley which my race seldom frequents,\nawaiting the time that he should come back and free me\nfrom Jubal.",
        "“But at last one of Jubal’s hunters saw me as I was creeping\ntoward my father’s cave to see if my brother had yet\nreturned and he gave the alarm and Jubal set out after me.\nHe has been pursuing me across many lands. He cannot\nbe far behind me now. When he comes he will kill you\nand carry me back to his cave. He is a terrible man.\nI have gone as far as I can go, and there is no escape,\"\nand she looked hopelessly up at the continuation of the ledge\ntwenty feet above us.",
        "“But he shall not have me,” she suddenly cried,\nwith great vehemence. “The sea is there\"—she pointed over\nthe edge of the cliff—\"and the sea shall have me rather than Jubal.”",
        "“But I have you now Dian,” I cried; “nor shall Jubal,\nnor any other have you, for you are mine,” and I seized\nher hand, nor did I lift it above her head and let it fall\nin token of release.",
        "She had risen to her feet, and was looking straight\ninto my eyes with level gaze.",
        "“I do not believe you,” she said, “for if you meant it\nyou would have done this when the others were present\nto witness it—then I should truly have been your mate;\nnow there is no one to see you do it, for you know that\nwithout witnesses your act does not bind you to me,\"\nand she withdrew her hand from mine and turned away.",
        "I tried to convince her that I was sincere, but she\nsimply couldn’t forget the humiliation that I had put\nupon her on that other occasion.",
        "“If you mean all that you say you will have ample chance to\nprove it,” she said, “if Jubal does not catch and kill you.\nI am in your power, and the treatment you accord me\nwill be the best proof of your intentions toward me.\nI am not your mate, and again I tell you that I hate you,\nand that I should be glad if I never saw you again.”",
        "Dian certainly was candid. There was no gainsaying that.\nIn fact I found candor and directness to be quite\na marked characteristic of the cave men of Pellucidar.\nFinally I suggested that we make some attempt to gain\nmy cave, where we might escape the searching Jubal,\nfor I am free to admit that I had no considerable desire\nto meet the formidable and ferocious creature, of whose\nmighty prowess Dian had told me when I first met her.\nHe it was who, armed with a puny knife, had met and killed\na cave bear in a hand-to-hand struggle. It was Jubal who\ncould cast his spear entirely through the armored carcass\nof the sadok at fifty paces. It was he who had crushed\nthe skull of a charging dyryth with a single blow of his\nwar club. No, I was not pining to meet the Ugly One-and it\nwas quite certain that I should not go out and hunt for him;\nbut the matter was taken out of my hands very quickly,\nas is often the way, and I did meet Jubal the Ugly One face\nto face.",
        "This is how it happened. I had led Dian back along\nthe ledge the way she had come, searching for a path\nthat would lead us to the top of the cliff, for I knew\nthat we could then cross over to the edge of my own\nlittle valley, where I felt certain we should find a means\nof ingress from the cliff top. As we proceeded along\nthe ledge I gave Dian minute directions for finding my\ncave against the chance of something happening to me.\nI knew that she would be quite safely hidden away\nfrom pursuit once she gained the shelter of my lair,\nand the valley would afford her ample means of sustenance.",
        "Also, I was very much piqued by her treatment of me.\nMy heart was sad and heavy, and I wanted to make her feel\nbadly by suggesting that something terrible might happen\nto me—that I might, in fact, be killed. But it didn’t\nwork worth a cent, at least as far as I could perceive.\nDian simply shrugged those magnificent shoulders of hers,\nand murmured something to the effect that one was not rid of\ntrouble so easily as that.",
        "For a while I kept still. I was utterly squelched.\nAnd to think that I had twice protected her from\nattack—the last time risking my life to save hers.\nIt was incredible that even a daughter of the Stone Age\ncould be so ungrateful—so heartless; but maybe her heart\npartook of the qualities of her epoch.",
        "Presently we found a rift in the cliff which had been widened\nand extended by the action of the water draining through it\nfrom the plateau above. It gave us a rather rough climb\nto the summit, but finally we stood upon the level mesa\nwhich stretched back for several miles to the mountain range.\nBehind us lay the broad inland sea, curving upward in the\nhorizonless distance to merge into the blue of the sky,\nso that for all the world it looked as though the sea\nlapped back to arch completely over us and disappear beyond\nthe distant mountains at our backs—the weird and uncanny\naspect of the seascapes of Pellucidar balk description.",
        "At our right lay a dense forest, but to the left the country\nwas open and clear to the plateau’s farther verge.\nIt was in this direction that our way led, and we had\nturned to resume our journey when Dian touched my arm.\nI turned to her, thinking that she was about to make\npeace overtures; but I was mistaken.",
        "“Jubal,” she said, and nodded toward the forest.",
        "I looked, and there, emerging from the dense wood,\ncame a perfect whale of a man. He must have been seven\nfeet tall, and proportioned accordingly. He still was\ntoo far off to distinguish his features.",
        "“Run,” I said to Dian. “I can engage him until you get\na good start. Maybe I can hold him until you have gotten\nentirely away,” and then, without a backward glance,\nI advanced to meet the Ugly One. I had hoped that Dian\nwould have a kind word to say to me before she went,\nfor she must have known that I was going to my death\nfor her sake; but she never even so much as bid me\ngood-bye, and it was with a heavy heart that I strode\nthrough the flower-bespangled grass to my doom.",
        "When I had come close enough to Jubal to distinguish\nhis features I understood how it was that he had earned\nthe sobriquet of Ugly One. Apparently some fearful\nbeast had ripped away one entire side of his face.\nThe eye was gone, the nose, and all the flesh, so that\nhis jaws and all his teeth were exposed and grinning\nthrough the horrible scar.",
        "Formerly he may have been as good to look upon as the others\nof his handsome race, and it may be that the terrible\nresult of this encounter had tended to sour an already\nstrong and brutal character. However this may be it\nis quite certain that he was not a pretty sight, and now\nthat his features, or what remained of them, were distorted\nin rage at the sight of Dian with another male, he was\nindeed most terrible to see—and much more terrible to meet.",
        "He had broken into a run now, and as he advanced he\nraised his mighty spear, while I halted and fitting\nan arrow to my bow took as steady aim as I could.\nI was somewhat longer than usual, for I must confess that\nthe sight of this awful man had wrought upon my nerves\nto such an extent that my knees were anything but steady.\nWhat chance had I against this mighty warrior for whom\neven the fiercest cave bear had no terrors! Could I\nhope to best one who slaughtered the sadok and dyryth\nsinglehanded! I shuddered; but, in fairness to myself,\nmy fear was more for Dian than for my own fate.",
        "And then the great brute launched his massive stone-tipped\nspear, and I raised my shield to break the force of its\nterrific velocity. The impact hurled me to my knees,\nbut the shield had deflected the missile and I was unscathed.\nJubal was rushing upon me now with the only remaining\nweapon that he carried—a murderous-looking knife.\nHe was too close for a careful bowshot, but I let drive\nat him as he came, without taking aim. My arrow pierced\nthe fleshy part of his thigh, inflicting a painful\nbut not disabling wound. And then he was upon me.",
        "My agility saved me for the instant. I ducked beneath\nhis raised arm, and when he wheeled to come at me again he\nfound a sword’s point in his face. And a moment later he\nfelt an inch or two of it in the muscles of his knife arm,\nso that thereafter he went more warily.",
        "It was a duel of strategy now—the great, hairy man maneuvering\nto get inside my guard where he could bring those giant\nthews to play, while my wits were directed to the task\nof keeping him at arm’s length. Thrice he rushed me,\nand thrice I caught his knife blow upon my shield.\nEach time my sword found his body—once penetrating\nto his lung. He was covered with blood by this time,\nand the internal hemorrhage induced paroxysms of coughing\nthat brought the red stream through the hideous mouth\nand nose, covering his face and breast with bloody froth.\nHe was a most unlovely spectacle, but he was far from dead.",
        "As the duel continued I began to gain confidence, for,\nto be perfectly candid, I had not expected to survive\nthe first rush of that monstrous engine of ungoverned\nrage and hatred. And I think that Jubal, from utter\ncontempt of me, began to change to a feeling of respect,\nand then in his primitive mind there evidently loomed\nthe thought that perhaps at last he had met his master,\nand was facing his end.",
        "At any rate it is only upon this hypothesis that I can\naccount for his next act, which was in the nature of a last\nresort—a sort of forlorn hope, which could only have been\nborn of the belief that if he did not kill me quickly\nI should kill him. It happened on the occasion of his\nfourth charge, when, instead of striking at me with his knife,\nhe dropped that weapon, and seizing my sword blade in both\nhis hands wrenched the weapon from my grasp as easily as\nfrom a babe.",
        "Flinging it far to one side he stood motionless for just\nan instant glaring into my face with such a horrid leer\nof malignant triumph as to almost unnerve me—then he\nsprang for me with his bare hands. But it was Jubal’s\nday to learn new methods of warfare. For the first time\nhe had seen a bow and arrows, never before that duel\nhad he beheld a sword, and now he learned what a man\nwho knows may do with his bare fists.",
        "As he came for me, like a great bear, I ducked again\nbeneath his outstretched arm, and as I came up planted\nas clean a blow upon his jaw as ever you have seen.\nDown went that great mountain of flesh sprawling upon\nthe ground. He was so surprised and dazed that he lay there\nfor several seconds before he made any attempt to rise,\nand I stood over him with another dose ready when he\nshould gain his knees.",
        "Up he came at last, almost roaring in his rage and mortification;\nbut he didn’t stay up—I let him have a left fair on the\npoint of the jaw that sent him tumbling over on his back.\nBy this time I think Jubal had gone mad with hate, for no sane\nman would have come back for more as many times as he did.\nTime after time I bowled him over as fast as he could\nstagger up, until toward the last he lay longer on the\nground between blows, and each time came up weaker than before.",
        "He was bleeding very profusely now from the wound in his lungs,\nand presently a terrific blow over the heart sent him\nreeling heavily to the ground, where he lay very still,\nand somehow I knew at once that Jubal the Ugly One would\nnever get up again. But even as I looked upon that massive\nbody lying there so grim and terrible in death, I could\nnot believe that I, single-handed, had bested this slayer\nof fearful beasts—this gigantic ogre of the Stone Age.",
        "Picking up my sword I leaned upon it, looking down on\nthe dead body of my foeman, and as I thought of the battle\nI had just fought and won a great idea was born in my\nbrain—the outcome of this and the suggestion that Perry\nhad made within the city of Phutra. If skill and science\ncould render a comparative pygmy the master of this\nmighty brute, what could not the brute’s fellows accomplish\nwith the same skill and science. Why all Pellucidar would\nbe at their feet—and I would be their king and Dian their queen.",
        "Dian! A little wave of doubt swept over me. It was quite\nwithin the possibilities of Dian to look down upon me even\nwere I king. She was quite the most superior person I\never had met—with the most convincing way of letting you\nknow that she was superior. Well, I could go to the cave,\nand tell her that I had killed Jubal, and then she\nmight feel more kindly toward me, since I had freed her\nof her tormentor. I hoped that she had found the cave\neasily—it would be terrible had I lost her again, and I\nturned to gather up my shield and bow to hurry after her,\nwhen to my astonishment I found her standing not ten paces\nbehind me.",
        "“Girl!” I cried, “what are you doing here? I thought\nthat you had gone to the cave, as I told you to do.”",
        "Up went her head, and the look that she gave me took\nall the majesty out of me, and left me feeling more\nlike the palace janitor—if palaces have janitors.",
        "“As you told me to do!” she cried, stamping her little foot.\n\"I do as I please. I am the daughter of a king,\nand furthermore, I hate you.”",
        "I was dumbfounded—this was my thanks for saving\nher from Jubal! I turned and looked at the corpse.\n\"May be that I saved you from a worse fate, old man,\"\nI said, but I guess it was lost on Dian, for she never\nseemed to notice it at all.",
        "“Let us go to my cave,” I said, “I am tired and hungry.”",
        "She followed along a pace behind me, neither of us speaking.\nI was too angry, and she evidently didn’t care to converse\nwith the lower orders. I was mad all the way through,\nas I had certainly felt that at least a word of thanks should\nhave rewarded me, for I knew that even by her own standards,\nI must have done a very wonderful thing to have killed\nthe redoubtable Jubal in a hand-to-hand encounter.",
        "We had no difficulty in finding my lair, and then I went\ndown into the valley and bowled over a small antelope,\nwhich I dragged up the steep ascent to the ledge before\nthe door. Here we ate in silence. Occasionally I glanced\nat her, thinking that the sight of her tearing at raw\nflesh with her hands and teeth like some wild animal\nwould cause a revulsion of my sentiments toward her;\nbut to my surprise I found that she ate quite as daintily\nas the most civilized woman of my acquaintance, and finally\nI found myself gazing in foolish rapture at the beauties\nof her strong, white teeth. Such is love.",
        "After our repast we went down to the river together\nand bathed our hands and faces, and then after drinking\nour fill went back to the cave. Without a word I crawled\ninto the farthest corner and, curling up, was soon asleep.",
        "When I awoke I found Dian sitting in the doorway looking out\nacross the valley. As I came out she moved to one side to let\nme pass, but she had no word for me. I wanted to hate her,\nbut I couldn’t. Every time I looked at her something came\nup in my throat, so that I nearly choked. I had never been\nin love before, but I did not need any aid in diagnosing\nmy case—I certainly had it and had it bad. God, how I\nloved that beautiful, disdainful, tantalizing, prehistoric girl!",
        "After we had eaten again I asked Dian if she intended\nreturning to her tribe now that Jubal was dead, but she\nshook her head sadly, and said that she did not dare,\nfor there was still Jubal’s brother to be considered—his\noldest brother.",
        "“What has he to do with it?” I asked. “Does he too want you,\nor has the option on you become a family heirloom,\nto be passed on down from generation to generation?”",
        "She was not quite sure as to what I meant.",
        "“It is probable,” she said, “that they all will want revenge\nfor the death of Jubal—there are seven of them—seven\nterrible men. Someone may have to kill them all,\nif I am to return to my people.”",
        "It began to look as though I had assumed a contract much\ntoo large for me—about seven sizes, in fact.",
        "“Had Jubal any cousins?” I asked. It was just as well\nto know the worst at once.",
        "“Yes,” replied Dian, “but they don’t count—they all have mates.\nJubal’s brothers have no mates because Jubal could get\nnone for himself. He was so ugly that women ran away\nfrom him—some have even thrown themselves from the cliffs\nof Amoz into the Darel Az rather than mate with the Ugly One.”",
        "“But what had that to do with his brothers?” I asked.",
        "“I forget that you are not of Pellucidar,” said Dian,\nwith a look of pity mixed with contempt, and the contempt\nseemed to be laid on a little thicker than the circumstance\nwarranted—as though to make quite certain that I shouldn’t\noverlook it. “You see,” she continued, “a younger brother\nmay not take a mate until all his older brothers have\ndone so, unless the older brother waives his prerogative,\nwhich Jubal would not do, knowing that as long as he\nkept them single they would be all the keener in aiding\nhim to secure a mate.”",
        "Noticing that Dian was becoming more communicative I\nbegan to entertain hopes that she might be warming up\ntoward me a bit, although upon what slender thread\nI hung my hopes I soon discovered.",
        "“As you dare not return to Amoz,” I ventured, “what is\nto become of you since you cannot be happy here with me,\nhating me as you do?”",
        "“I shall have to put up with you,” she replied coldly,\n\"until you see fit to go elsewhere and leave me in peace,\nthen I shall get along very well alone.”",
        "I looked at her in utter amazement. It seemed\nincredible that even a prehistoric woman could\nbe so cold and heartless and ungrateful. Then I arose.",
        "“I shall leave you NOW,” I said haughtily, “I have had quite\nenough of your ingratitude and your insults,” and then I\nturned and strode majestically down toward the valley.\nI had taken a hundred steps in absolute silence, and then\nDian spoke.",
        "“I hate you!” she shouted, and her voice broke—in rage,\nI thought.",
        "I was absolutely miserable, but I hadn’t gone too far\nwhen I began to realize that I couldn’t leave her alone\nthere without protection, to hunt her own food amid\nthe dangers of that savage world. She might hate me,\nand revile me, and heap indignity after indignity upon me,\nas she already had, until I should have hated her;\nbut the pitiful fact remained that I loved her, and I\ncouldn’t leave her there alone.",
        "The more I thought about it the madder I got,\nso that by the time I reached the valley I was furious,\nand the result of it was that I turned right around\nand went up that cliff again as fast as I had come down.\nI saw that Dian had left the ledge and gone within the cave,\nbut I bolted right in after her. She was lying upon her\nface on the pile of grasses I had gathered for her bed.\nWhen she heard me enter she sprang to her feet like\na tigress.",
        "“I hate you!” she cried.",
        "Coming from the brilliant light of the noonday sun into\nthe semidarkness of the cave I could not see her features,\nand I was rather glad, for I disliked to think of the hate\nthat I should have read there.",
        "I never said a word to her at first. I just strode\nacross the cave and grasped her by the wrists, and when\nshe struggled, I put my arm around her so as to pinion her\nhands to her sides. She fought like a tigress, but I took\nmy free hand and pushed her head back—I imagine that I\nhad suddenly turned brute, that I had gone back a thousand\nmillion years, and was again a veritable cave man taking\nmy mate by force—and then I kissed that beautiful mouth\nagain and again.",
        "“Dian,” I cried, shaking her roughly, “I love you.\nCan’t you understand that I love you? That I love you\nbetter than all else in this world or my own? That I am\ngoing to have you? That love like mine cannot be denied?”",
        "I noticed that she lay very still in my arms now,\nand as my eyes became accustomed to the light I saw\nthat she was smiling—a very contented, happy smile.\nI was thunderstruck. Then I realized that, very gently,\nshe was trying to disengage her arms, and I loosened my\ngrip upon them so that she could do so. Slowly they came\nup and stole about my neck, and then she drew my lips down\nto hers once more and held them there for a long time.\nAt last she spoke.",
        "“Why didn’t you do this at first, David? I have been\nwaiting so long.”",
        "“What!” I cried. “You said that you hated me!”",
        "“Did you expect me to run into your arms, and say that I\nloved you before I knew that you loved me?” she asked.",
        "“But I have told you right along that I love you,” I said.\n\"Love speaks in acts,” she replied. “You could have made\nyour mouth say what you wished it to say, but just now\nwhen you came and took me in your arms your heart spoke\nto mine in the language that a woman’s heart understands.\nWhat a silly man you are, David?”",
        "“Then you haven’t hated me at all, Dian?” I asked.",
        "“I have loved you always,” she whispered, “from the\nfirst moment that I saw you, although I did not know\nit until that time you struck down Hooja the Sly One,\nand then spurned me.”",
        "“But I didn’t spurn you, dear,” I cried. “I didn’t know\nyour ways—I doubt if I do now. It seems incredible\nthat you could have reviled me so, and yet have cared\nfor me all the time.”",
        "“You might have known,” she said, “when I did not run away\nfrom you that it was not hate which chained me to you.\nWhile you were battling with Jubal, I could have run\nto the edge of the forest, and when I learned the outcome\nof the combat it would have been a simple thing to have\neluded you and returned to my own people.”",
        "“But Jubal’s brothers—and cousins—” I reminded her,\n\"how about them?”",
        "She smiled, and hid her face on my shoulder.",
        "“I had to tell you SOMETHING, David,” she whispered.\n\"I must needs have SOME excuse for remaining near you.”",
        "“You little sinner!” I exclaimed. “And you have caused\nme all this anguish for nothing!”",
        "“I have suffered even more,” she answered simply, “for I\nthought that you did not love me, and I was helpless.\nI couldn’t come to you and demand that my love be returned,\nas you have just come to me. Just now when you went away\nhope went with you. I was wretched, terrified, miserable,\nand my heart was breaking. I wept, and I have not done\nthat before since my mother died,” and now I saw that there\nwas the moisture of tears about her eyes. It was near\nto making me cry myself when I thought of all that poor\nchild had been through. Motherless and unprotected;\nhunted across a savage, primeval world by that hideous\nbrute of a man; exposed to the attacks of the countless\nfearsome denizens of its mountains, its plains, and its\njungles—it was a miracle that she had survived it all.",
        "To me it was a revelation of the things my early forebears\nmust have endured that the human race of the outer\ncrust might survive. It made me very proud to think\nthat I had won the love of such a woman. Of course\nshe couldn’t read or write; there was nothing cultured\nor refined about her as you judge culture and refinement;\nbut she was the essence of all that is best in woman,\nfor she was good, and brave, and noble, and virtuous.\nAnd she was all these things in spite of the fact\nthat their observance entailed suffering and danger\nand possible death.",
        "How much easier it would have been to have gone to Jubal\nin the first place! She would have been his lawful mate.\nShe would have been queen in her own land—and it meant\njust as much to the cave woman to be a queen in the Stone\nAge as it does to the woman of today to be a queen now;\nit’s all comparative glory any way you look at it,\nand if there were only half-naked savages on the outer\ncrust today, you’d find that it would be considerable glory\nto be the wife a Dahomey chief.",
        "I couldn’t help but compare Dian’s action with that\nof a splendid young woman I had known in New York—I\nmean splendid to look at and to talk to. She had been\nhead over heels in love with a chum of mine—a clean,\nmanly chap—but she had married a broken-down, disreputable\nold debauchee because he was a count in some dinky\nlittle European principality that was not even accorded\na distinctive color by Rand McNally.",
        "Yes, I was mighty proud of Dian.",
        "After a time we decided to set out for Sari, as I was anxious\nto see Perry, and to know that all was right with him.\nI had told Dian about our plan of emancipating the human\nrace of Pellucidar, and she was fairly wild over it.\nShe said that if Dacor, her brother, would only return he\ncould easily be king of Amoz, and that then he and Ghak\ncould form an alliance. That would give us a flying start,\nfor the Sarians and the Amozites were both very powerful tribes.\nOnce they had been armed with swords, and bows and arrows,\nand trained in their use we were confident that they\ncould overcome any tribe that seemed disinclined to join\nthe great army of federated states with which we were\nplanning to march upon the Mahars.",
        "I explained the various destructive engines of war\nwhich Perry and I could construct after a little\nexperimentation—gunpowder, rifles, cannon, and the like,\nand Dian would clap her hands, and throw her arms about my neck,\nand tell me what a wonderful thing I was. She was beginning\nto think that I was omnipotent although I really hadn’t\ndone anything but talk—but that is the way with women\nwhen they love. Perry used to say that if a fellow was\none-tenth as remarkable as his wife or mother thought him,\nhe would have the world by the tail with a down-hill drag.",
        "The first time we started for Sari I stepped into a nest\nof poisonous vipers before we reached the valley.\nA little fellow stung me on the ankle, and Dian made me\ncome back to the cave. She said that I mustn’t exercise,\nor it might prove fatal—if it had been a full-grown\nsnake that struck me she said, I wouldn’t have moved\na single pace from the nest—I’d have died in my tracks,\nso virulent is the poison. As it was I must have been laid\nup for quite a while, though Dian’s poultices of herbs\nand leaves finally reduced the swelling and drew out\nthe poison.",
        "The episode proved most fortunate, however, as it gave\nme an idea which added a thousand-fold to the value\nof my arrows as missiles of offense and defense.\nAs soon as I was able to be about again, I sought out\nsome adult vipers of the species which had stung me,\nand having killed them, I extracted their virus,\nsmearing it upon the tips of several arrows. Later I\nshot a hyaenodon with one of these, and though my arrow\ninflicted but a superficial flesh wound the beast\ncrumpled in death almost immediately after he was hit.",
        "We now set out once more for the land of the Sarians,\nand it was with feelings of sincere regret that we bade\ngood-bye to our beautiful Garden of Eden, in the comparative\npeace and harmony of which we had lived the happiest moments\nof our lives. How long we had been there I did not know,\nfor as I have told you, time had ceased to exist for me\nbeneath that eternal noonday sun—it may have been an hour,\nor a month of earthly time; I do not know.",
        "We crossed the river and passed through the mountains beyond,\nand finally we came out upon a great level plain which\nstretched away as far as the eye could reach. I cannot tell\nyou in what direction it stretched even if you would care\nto know, for all the while that I was within Pellucidar\nI never discovered any but local methods of indicating\ndirection—there is no north, no south, no east, no west.\nUP is about the only direction which is well defined,\nand that, of course, is DOWN to you of the outer crust.\nSince the sun neither rises nor sets there is no method\nof indicating direction beyond visible objects such as\nhigh mountains, forests, lakes, and seas.",
        "The plain which lies beyond the white cliffs which flank\nthe Darel Az upon the shore nearest the Mountains\nof the Clouds is about as near to any direction as any\nPellucidarian can come. If you happen not to have heard\nof the Darel Az, or the white cliffs, or the Mountains\nof the Clouds you feel that there is something lacking,\nand long for the good old understandable northeast\nand southwest of the outer world.",
        "We had barely entered the great plain when we discovered\ntwo enormous animals approaching us from a great distance.\nSo far were they that we could not distinguish what manner\nof beasts they might be, but as they came closer, I saw that\nthey were enormous quadrupeds, eighty or a hundred feet long,\nwith tiny heads perched at the top of very long necks.\nTheir heads must have been quite forty feet from the ground.\nThe beasts moved very slowly—that is their action was\nslow—but their strides covered such a great distance\nthat in reality they traveled considerably faster than\na man walks.",
        "As they drew still nearer we discovered that upon the back\nof each sat a human being. Then Dian knew what they were,\nthough she never before had seen one.",
        "“They are lidis from the land of the Thorians,” she cried.\n\"Thoria lies at the outer verge of the Land of Awful Shadow.\nThe Thorians alone of all the races of Pellucidar ride\nthe lidi, for nowhere else than beside the dark country\nare they found.”",
        "“What is the Land of Awful Shadow?” I asked.",
        "“It is the land which lies beneath the Dead World,\"\nreplied Dian; “the Dead World which hangs forever between\nthe sun and Pellucidar above the Land of Awful Shadow.\nIt is the Dead World which makes the great shadow upon this\nportion of Pellucidar.”",
        "I did not fully understand what she meant, nor am I\nsure that I do yet, for I have never been to that part\nof Pellucidar from which the Dead World is visible;\nbut Perry says that it is the moon of Pellucidar—a tiny\nplanet within a planet—and that it revolves around\nthe earth’s axis coincidently with the earth, and thus\nis always above the same spot within Pellucidar.",
        "I remember that Perry was very much excited when I told\nhim about this Dead World, for he seemed to think that it\nexplained the hitherto inexplicable phenomena of nutation\nand the precession of the equinoxes.",
        "When the two upon the lidis had come quite close to us\nwe saw that one was a man and the other a woman.\nThe former had held up his two hands, palms toward us,\nin sign of peace, and I had answered him in kind,\nwhen he suddenly gave a cry of astonishment and pleasure,\nand slipping from his enormous mount ran forward toward Dian,\nthrowing his arms about her.",
        "In an instant I was white with jealousy, but only for\nan instant; since Dian quickly drew the man toward me,\ntelling him that I was David, her mate.",
        "“And this is my brother, Dacor the Strong One, David,\"\nshe said to me.",
        "It appeared that the woman was Dacor’s mate. He had\nfound none to his liking among the Sari, nor farther on\nuntil he had come to the land of the Thoria, and there\nhe had found and fought for this very lovely Thorian\nmaiden whom he was bringing back to his own people.",
        "When they had heard our story and our plans they decided\nto accompany us to Sari, that Dacor and Ghak might come\nto an agreement relative to an alliance, as Dacor was\nquite as enthusiastic about the proposed annihilation\nof the Mahars and Sagoths as either Dian or I.",
        "After a journey which was, for Pellucidar, quite uneventful,\nwe came to the first of the Sarian villages which consists\nof between one and two hundred artificial caves cut into\nthe face of a great cliff. Here to our immense delight,\nwe found both Perry and Ghak. The old man was quite\novercome at sight of me for he had long since given me\nup as dead.",
        "When I introduced Dian as my wife, he didn’t quite know\nwhat to say, but he afterward remarked that with the pick\nof two worlds I could not have done better.",
        "Ghak and Dacor reached a very amicable arrangement,\nand it was at a council of the head men of the various\ntribes of the Sari that the eventual form of government\nwas tentatively agreed upon. Roughly, the various\nkingdoms were to remain virtually independent,\nbut there was to be one great overlord, or emperor.\nIt was decided that I should be the first of the dynasty\nof the emperors of Pellucidar.",
        "We set about teaching the women how to make bows and arrows,\nand poison pouches. The young men hunted the vipers which\nprovided the virus, and it was they who mined the iron ore,\nand fashioned the swords under Perry’s direction.\nRapidly the fever spread from one tribe to another until\nrepresentatives from nations so far distant that the\nSarians had never even heard of them came in to take\nthe oath of allegiance which we required, and to learn\nthe art of making the new weapons and using them.",
        "We sent our young men out as instructors to every\nnation of the federation, and the movement had reached\ncolossal proportions before the Mahars discovered it.\nThe first intimation they had was when three of their great\nslave caravans were annihilated in rapid succession.\nThey could not comprehend that the lower orders had suddenly\ndeveloped a power which rendered them really formidable.",
        "In one of the skirmishes with slave caravans some of our\nSarians took a number of Sagoth prisoners, and among\nthem were two who had been members of the guards within\nthe building where we had been confined at Phutra.\nThey told us that the Mahars were frantic with rage\nwhen they discovered what had taken place in the cellars\nof the buildings. The Sagoths knew that something very\nterrible had befallen their masters, but the Mahars had been\nmost careful to see that no inkling of the true nature\nof their vital affliction reached beyond their own race.\nHow long it would take for the race to become extinct\nit was impossible even to guess; but that this must\neventually happen seemed inevitable.",
        "The Mahars had offered fabulous rewards for the capture\nof any one of us alive, and at the same time had threatened\nto inflict the direst punishment upon whomever should\nharm us. The Sagoths could not understand these seemingly\nparadoxical instructions, though their purpose was quite\nevident to me. The Mahars wanted the Great Secret,\nand they knew that we alone could deliver it to them.",
        "Perry’s experiments in the manufacture of gunpowder and the\nfashioning of rifles had not progressed as rapidly as we\nhad hoped—there was a whole lot about these two arts which\nPerry didn’t know. We were both assured that the solution\nof these problems would advance the cause of civilization\nwithin Pellucidar thousands of years at a single stroke.\nThen there were various other arts and sciences which we\nwished to introduce, but our combined knowledge of them\ndid not embrace the mechanical details which alone\ncould render them of commercial, or practical value.",
        "“David,” said Perry, immediately after his latest failure to\nproduce gunpowder that would even burn, “one of us must return\nto the outer world and bring back the information we lack.\nHere we have all the labor and materials for reproducing\nanything that ever has been produced above—what we lack\nis knowledge. Let us go back and get that knowledge\nin the shape of books—then this world will indeed be at our feet.”",
        "And so it was decided that I should return in the prospector,\nwhich still lay upon the edge of the forest at the point where\nwe had first penetrated to the surface of the inner world.\nDian would not listen to any arrangement for my going\nwhich did not include her, and I was not sorry that she\nwished to accompany me, for I wanted her to see my world,\nand I wanted my world to see her.",
        "With a large force of men we marched to the great iron mole,\nwhich Perry soon had hoisted into position with its nose\npointed back toward the outer crust. He went over all\nthe machinery carefully. He replenished the air tanks,\nand manufactured oil for the engine. At last everything\nwas ready, and we were about to set out when our pickets,\na long, thin line of which had surrounded our camp at\nall times, reported that a great body of what appeared\nto be Sagoths and Mahars were approaching from the direction\nof Phutra.",
        "Dian and I were ready to embark, but I was anxious\nto witness the first clash between two fair-sized armies\nof the opposing races of Pellucidar. I realized that this\nwas to mark the historic beginning of a mighty struggle\nfor possession of a world, and as the first emperor\nof Pellucidar I felt that it was not alone my duty,\nbut my right, to be in the thick of that momentous struggle.",
        "As the opposing army approached we saw that there were many\nMahars with the Sagoth troops—an indication of the vast\nimportance which the dominant race placed upon the outcome\nof this campaign, for it was not customary with them to take\nactive part in the sorties which their creatures made for\nslaves—the only form of warfare which they waged upon the\nlower orders.",
        "Ghak and Dacor were both with us, having come primarily to\nview the prospector. I placed Ghak with some of his Sarians\non the right of our battle line. Dacor took the left,\nwhile I commanded the center. Behind us I stationed\na sufficient reserve under one of Ghak’s head men.\nThe Sagoths advanced steadily with menacing spears,\nand I let them come until they were within easy bowshot\nbefore I gave the word to fire.",
        "At the first volley of poison-tipped arrows the front\nranks of the gorilla-men crumpled to the ground; but those\nbehind charged over the prostrate forms of their comrades\nin a wild, mad rush to be upon us with their spears.\nA second volley stopped them for an instant, and then\nmy reserve sprang through the openings in the firing line\nto engage them with sword and shield. The clumsy spears\nof the Sagoths were no match for the swords of the Sarian\nand Amozite, who turned the spear thrusts aside with their\nshields and leaped to close quarters with their lighter,\nhandier weapons.",
        "Ghak took his archers along the enemy’s flank, and while\nthe swordsmen engaged them in front, he poured volley after\nvolley into their unprotected left. The Mahars did little\nreal fighting, and were more in the way than otherwise,\nthough occasionally one of them would fasten its powerful\njaw upon the arm or leg of a Sarian.",
        "The battle did not last a great while, for when Dacor\nand I led our men in upon the Sagoth’s right with naked\nswords they were already so demoralized that they turned\nand fled before us. We pursued them for some time,\ntaking many prisoners and recovering nearly a hundred slaves,\namong whom was Hooja the Sly One.",
        "He told me that he had been captured while on his way\nto his own land; but that his life had been spared\nin hope that through him the Mahars would learn the\nwhereabouts of their Great Secret. Ghak and I were\ninclined to think that the Sly One had been guiding\nthis expedition to the land of Sari, where he thought\nthat the book might be found in Perry’s possession;\nbut we had no proof of this and so we took him in and\ntreated him as one of us, although none liked him.\nAnd how he rewarded my generosity you will presently learn.",
        "There were a number of Mahars among our prisoners,\nand so fearful were our own people of them that they\nwould not approach them unless completely covered\nfrom the sight of the reptiles by a piece of skin.\nEven Dian shared the popular superstition regarding\nthe evil effects of exposure to the eyes of angry Mahars,\nand though I laughed at her fears I was willing enough\nto humor them if it would relieve her apprehension\nin any degree, and so she sat apart from the prospector,\nnear which the Mahars had been chained, while Perry and I\nagain inspected every portion of the mechanism.",
        "At last I took my place in the driving seat, and called\nto one of the men without to fetch Dian. It happened that\nHooja stood quite close to the doorway of the prospector,\nso that it was he who, without my knowledge, went to\nbring her; but how he succeeded in accomplishing the\nfiendish thing he did, I cannot guess, unless there were\nothers in the plot to aid him. Nor can I believe that,\nsince all my people were loyal to me and would have made\nshort work of Hooja had he suggested the heartless scheme,\neven had he had time to acquaint another with it.\nIt was all done so quickly that I may only believe that it\nwas the result of sudden impulse, aided by a number of,\nto Hooja, fortuitous circumstances occurring at precisely\nthe right moment.",
        "All I know is that it was Hooja who brought Dian\nto the prospector, still wrapped from head to toe\nin the skin of an enormous cave lion which covered her\nsince the Mahar prisoners had been brought into camp.\nHe deposited his burden in the seat beside me. I was all\nready to get under way. The good-byes had been said.\nPerry had grasped my hand in the last, long farewell.\nI closed and barred the outer and inner doors,\ntook my seat again at the driving mechanism, and pulled\nthe starting lever.",
        "As before on that far-gone night that had witnessed our\nfirst trial of the iron monster, there was a frightful\nroaring beneath us—the giant frame trembled and vibrated—\nthere was a rush of sound as the loose earth passed up\nthrough the hollow space between the inner and outer jackets\nto be deposited in our wake. Once more the thing was off.",
        "But on the instant of departure I was nearly thrown\nfrom my seat by the sudden lurching of the prospector.\nAt first I did not realize what had happened, but presently\nit dawned upon me that just before entering the crust the\ntowering body had fallen through its supporting scaffolding,\nand that instead of entering the ground vertically we were\nplunging into it at a different angle. Where it would bring\nus out upon the upper crust I could not even conjecture.\nAnd then I turned to note the effect of this strange\nexperience upon Dian. She still sat shrouded in the great skin.",
        "“Come, come,” I cried, laughing, “come out of your shell.\nNo Mahar eyes can reach you here,” and I leaned over and\nsnatched the lion skin from her. And then I shrank back\nupon my seat in utter horror.",
        "The thing beneath the skin was not Dian—it was a\nhideous Mahar. Instantly I realized the trick that Hooja\nhad played upon me, and the purpose of it. Rid of me,\nforever as he doubtless thought, Dian would be at his mercy.\nFrantically I tore at the steering wheel in an effort\nto turn the prospector back toward Pellucidar; but, as on\nthat other occasion, I could not budge the thing a hair.",
        "It is needless to recount the horrors or the monotony\nof that journey. It varied but little from the former one\nwhich had brought us from the outer to the inner world.\nBecause of the angle at which we had entered the ground\nthe trip required nearly a day longer, and brought me out\nhere upon the sand of the Sahara instead of in the United\nStates as I had hoped.",
        "For months I have been waiting here for a white man to come.\nI dared not leave the prospector for fear I should never\nbe able to find it again—the shifting sands of the desert\nwould soon cover it, and then my only hope of returning\nto my Dian and her Pellucidar would be gone forever.",
        "That I ever shall see her again seems but remotely possible,\nfor how may I know upon what part of Pellucidar my return\njourney may terminate—and how, without a north or south\nor an east or a west may I hope ever to find my way across\nthat vast world to the tiny spot where my lost love lies\ngrieving for me?",
        "\nThat is the story as David Innes told it to me in the\ngoat-skin tent upon the rim of the great Sahara Desert.\nThe next day he took me out to see the prospector—it\nwas precisely as he had described it. So huge was it\nthat it could have been brought to this inaccessible part\nof the world by no means of transportation that existed\nthere—it could only have come in the way that David\nInnes said it came—up through the crust of the earth\nfrom the inner world of Pellucidar.",
        "I spent a week with him, and then, abandoned my\nlion hunt, returned directly to the coast and hurried\nto London where I purchased a great quantity of stuff\nwhich he wished to take back to Pellucidar with him.\nThere were books, rifles, revolvers, ammunition, cameras,\nchemicals, telephones, telegraph instruments, wire,\ntool and more books—books upon every subject under\nthe sun. He said he wanted a library with which they\ncould reproduce the wonders of the twentieth century\nin the Stone Age and if quantity counts for anything\nI got it for him.",
        "I took the things back to Algeria myself, and accompanied\nthem to the end of the railroad; but from here I\nwas recalled to America upon important business.\nHowever, I was able to employ a very trustworthy man\nto take charge of the caravan—the same guide, in fact,\nwho had accompanied me on the previous trip into the\nSahara—and after writing a long letter to Innes in which\nI gave him my American address, I saw the expedition head south.",
        "Among the other things which I sent to Innes was over five\nhundred miles of double, insulated wire of a very fine gauge.\nI had it packed on a special reel at his suggestion, as it\nwas his idea that he could fasten one end here before he\nleft and by paying it out through the end of the prospector\nlay a telegraph line between the outer and inner worlds.\nIn my letter I told him to be sure to mark the terminus\nof the line very plainly with a high cairn, in case I\nwas not able to reach him before he set out, so that I\nmight easily find and communicate with him should he\nbe so fortunate as to reach Pellucidar.",
        "I received several letters from him after I returned\nto America—in fact he took advantage of every\nnorthward-passing caravan to drop me word of some sort.\nHis last letter was written the day before he intended\nto depart. Here it is.",
        "\nMy Dear Friend:",
        "Tomorrow I shall set out in quest of Pellucidar and Dian.\nThat is if the Arabs don’t get me. They have been very nasty\nof late. I don’t know the cause, but on two occasions they\nhave threatened my life. One, more friendly than the rest,\ntold me today that they intended attacking me tonight.\nIt would be unfortunate should anything of that sort happen\nnow that I am so nearly ready to depart.",
        "However, maybe I will be as well off, for the nearer the\nhour approaches, the slenderer my chances for success appear.",
        "Here is the friendly Arab who is to take this letter north\nfor me, so good-bye, and God bless you for your kindness\nto me.",
        "The Arab tells me to hurry, for he sees a cloud of sand\nto the south—he thinks it is the party coming to murder me,\nand he doesn’t want to be found with me. So goodbye again.",
        "Yours,",
        "David Innes.",
        "\nA year later found me at the end of the railroad\nonce more, headed for the spot where I had left Innes.\nMy first disappointment was when I discovered that my\nold guide had died within a few weeks of my return,\nnor could I find any member of my former party who could\nlead me to the same spot.",
        "For months I searched that scorching land, interviewing\ncountless desert sheiks in the hope that at last I might find\none who had heard of Innes and his wonderful iron mole.\nConstantly my eyes scanned the blinding waste of sand\nfor the ricky cairn beneath which I was to find the wires\nleading to Pellucidar—but always was I unsuccessful.",
        "And always do these awful questions harass me when I\nthink of David Innes and his strange adventures.",
        "Did the Arabs murder him, after all, just on the eve\nof his departure? Or, did he again turn the nose of his\niron monster toward the inner world? Did he reach it,\nor lies he somewhere buried in the heart of the great crust?\nAnd if he did come again to Pellucidar was it to break\nthrough into the bottom of one of her great island seas,\nor among some savage race far, far from the land of his\nheart’s desire?",
        "Does the answer lie somewhere upon the bosom of the\nbroad Sahara, at the end of two tiny wires, hidden beneath\na lost cairn? I wonder.",
