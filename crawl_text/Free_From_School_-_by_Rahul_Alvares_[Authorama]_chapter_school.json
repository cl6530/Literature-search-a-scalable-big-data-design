        "You must try to understand that when I finished school I was as raw as\nraw could be. I had never travelled anywhere on my own, never purchased\na train ticket, since like most kids my age I had only travelled with\nmy parents or relatives and they made all the decisions. I had no\nexperience of how to handle money (my knowledge being limited to\nspending the 50 paise or one rupee I would receive as pocket money now\nand then).",
        "So while I had set my sights on travelling far and wide my parents\nwisely thought that I should begin by learning to manage on my own\nwithin Goa itself. It was also the rainy season and travelling around\nthe country would be much more difficult they explained.",
        "So I started out by helping at an aquarium shop in Mapusa, the town\nnearest my village. The proprietor of the shop is Ashok D’Cruz, a\ncollege friend of my father’s. I must tell you about Ashok. He is no\nordinary businessman: keeping fish is a passion with him. He is far\nmore interested in chatting with his customers about fish than making\nmoney selling them. I have never seen him forcing any of his customers\nto buy from his stock of aquarium fish.",
        "In fact, it was Ashok who introduced me to the amazing world of\naquarium fish way back when I was just nine and studying in Class V.\nUnder his guidance then, I experimented with breeding guppies, platties\nand mollies, fairly simple types of fish to breed. However, it was a\nmatter of great excitement for me at that time to be successful in my\nexperiments and Ashok was generous enough to even buy back from me the\nbaby fish I reared just to encourage me. Later I developed sufficient\nconfidence to experiment with and breed more difficult types of fish,\nlike Siamese Fighting Fish and Blue Guramies-all under the expert\ntutelage of Ashok.",
        "So it was to Ashok’s shop that I went every morning at 9.00 a.m.,\nspeeding on my bicycle to be on time. I would stay there until lunch\ntime, a regular hands on, doing whatever I was asked to do.",
        "Ashok’s shop is not very large. It is a two-roomed shop on the ground\nfloor of the Gomes Catao complex. It has a display section in front and\na store room at the back. The showroom has about twenty fish tanks on\ndisplay with a variety of fish that Ashok purchases mainly from Mumbai.\nEach tank stores a particular species of fish. Ashok’s shop is located\naway from the main market area so he does not have the advantage of\ncasual customers dropping by. However Ashok has his regular customers\nand there are always at least twenty to thirty customers daily.",
        "During my first few days at his shop, my work was only to watch the\ntanks, clean those which were dirty, remove the dead fish and do some\nother small jobs. I also fed the fish and treated the wounded and\ndiseased fish. Sometimes, I also attended to customers. Gradually, I\nbegan to accompany Ashok on his rounds to various places.",
        "A gentleman in Moira wanted to set up an aquarium at his home. He had a\ntank. He also had definite ideas about how he wanted it to finally look\nand Ashok was called to see how it could all be done. The man sent his\ncar for us. At his house we discussed the location of the tank,\nlighting arrangements, the water filters, the kind and quantity of fish\nhe would like to have, and maintenance. After we were fully satisfied\nthat we had everything right and had noted down his requirements, we\nreturned to Mapusa. Later he came for the material which we kept ready\nfor him.",
        "Another time I accompanied Ashok to a client’s office to put a pair of\nDwarf Guramies in the fish tank and to fix a picture as a backdrop for\nthe tank. On such visits I watched care fully what Ashok did and soon\nenough Ashok started sending me on my own to visit some of his clients\nwho had small or simple problems.",
        "I went to clients to fix aquarium equipment such as air pumps and\nfilters, to fix toys in the tanks, to check fish for diseases or if\nthere was a sudden crisis such as fish dying in numbers, or if a client\nwished to add more fish to his collection. I was sent to collect\noverdue payments or simply to enquire the aquariums were doing.\nSometimes I went on my own to visit some of the places where we had set\nup tanks and enjoyed watching the fish swimming happily in their new\nhomes.",
        "One day my employer decided to send me as a spy to find out the prices\nof fish and fish food at a competitive fish shop. I tried to behave\nlike a casual customer and walked coolly into the competitor’s shop and\ngradually began to ask the prices of fish and fish food. After I had\nfound out what was needed I bought a pair of cheap Black Mollies from\nhis shop just to show him that I was a genuine customer. From the\ninformation I got, we found Ashok’s to be comparatively cheaper than\nthe competitor.",
        "During this period I improved my knowledge about aquarium fish\ntremendously. This was mainly due to two things. Firstly, I had spent a\nlot of time observing the fish at Ashok’s shop and getting practical\nexperience from the places we visited. Secondly, I had been reading the\nfish books that my father bought for me as a gift for getting a\ndistinction in my SSC exam. The books were quite expensive but well\nworth the cost. Being able to get theoretical knowledge and practical\nexperience at the same time gave me a lot of confidence with regard to\naquarium fish.",
        "One of the important highlights of my experience at Ashok’s was\nlearning to make fish tanks. Ashok told me that since we were going\nthrough a slack period, he would teach me how to make fish tanks. I had\nto start from basics which meant purchasing glass for six tanks, having\nthe glass pieces cut to specifications and then having the pieces\ndelivered at the shop without a scratch.",
        "I had accompanied Ashok on several occasions earlier to the glass shop\nand watched as he ordered glass explaining his requirements, or having\na piece re-cut because it was done wrongly. In fact, I had been sent\noften to the glass shop for small purchases so I was fairly familiar\nwith the owner and the procedures. Ashok had even taught me how to\ncalculate the price of glass. Still it was a new experience for me when\nAshok handed me some money and gave me general directions on what to do\nand I was on my own.",
        "I managed to purchase the glass and also to get it cut to size. So\nfar, so good. Now came the difficult part of transporting the glass\npieces to the shop. I wondered whether I should get a rickshaw for the\npurpose but was a little hesitant since I hadn’t checked what it would\ncost for the trip, short though it would be. While I was trying to make\nup my mind by testing the package for its weight, the shopkeeper\nassured me that I would be able to handcarry the glass to Ashok’s shop,\nwhich is what I finally did.",
        "I started out. In the beginning, it was no problem. However, the\npackage grew heavier and heavier as I trudged up the road to Ashok’s\nshop with rickshaws, taxis and motorcycles honking away on all sides.\nEven before I reached my destination I doubted the wisdom of my actions\nfor I was tired and my arms ached but I dared not put down the glass\nsimply because it was glass. When I finally reached the shop I heaved a\nsigh of relief that the glass was intact. Ashok was horrified at my\ndecision and understandably very angry too for as he explained to me\nshould I have had an accident on the way the consequences would have\nbeen disastrous and he was after all responsible for me! I truly learnt\nan important lesson that day.",
        "Learning to make an aquarium tank is great fun. One has to first plan\nthe size of the tank. For this one must first decide on the length of\nthe tank. After that, the height and the breadth are to be\nproportionately calculated. The sides of the glass are held together\nwith silicone, which is a glue, and which feels like rubber when it\nhardens. Silicone does not dissolve in water. The tricky part is being\nable to apply the silicone only to the edges of the glass and not\nletting your sticky fingers touch any other portions of the glass.\nOtherwise, the glass will look dirty, for the silicone marks will stay\nlike a fingerprint on the glass forever. After the tank is resealed on\nthe inside with silicone (to give double protection), it is left for a\nday to dry. The next day it is tested by filling with water and if all\nis well the tank is ready for sale and can be delivered to the\ncustomer.",
        "After I was taught how to do the first tank, I started helping with the\nrest. I recall how once by mistake I stuck the glass upside down.\n\"There’s something fishy about the looks of this tank,” said Ashok.\nWhen he realized what my mistake was, he very nearly put me into the\ntank!",
        "My first opportunity at testing my skills at finding out the reasons\nfor “fish dying in an aquarium” (the most common complaint from\ncustomers) came when the manager of Hotel Osborne in Calangute asked\nAshok to come and examine their aquarium on the hotel premises. The\nfish were dying, he said. The owner of the hotel was a very good\ncustomer of Ashok’s and so Ashok was keen to solve the problem. However\nas he could not go himself that day and did not wish to delay matters,\nhe decided to send me instead. He gave me the manager’s visiting card,\ndirections to the hotel, some fish medicines and a pump to install in\nplace of the old one which was defective and I was on my own. I was\nproud and happy that Ashok felt confident to entrust me with such an\nimportant job.",
        "I left in the evening for the hotel. I found it with no problem at all.\nIt was a large hotel with lovely lawns and a swimming pool. I walked\ninto the hotel proudly, with my head held high, and tried to act as if\nI were a very experienced fish doctor. I went and met the manager. He\ntold me which fish had died. I searched for symptoms of disease but\nfound none. I then realised that the problem was very simple and one\nthat is very common: a case of overfeeding. Fish require food in\nproportion to their size but often people put more food than necessary\ninto the tank. The extra food makes the water cloudy and polluted and\nthis causes the fish to die.",
        "I cleaned the tanks, replaced the pump, checked the filters and showed\nthe hotel staff how to feed the fish. I even managed to do some sales\nwork by selling them some fish medicines which they could keep as\nstandby and made a bill for them on the bill book that Ashok had given\nme. They seemed satisfied with my work and made me a cup of tea, which\nI didn’t drink because I don’t drink tea. After I had finished I\ncouldn’t wait to tell Ashok about my experience.",
        "During this period, I took the opportunity once to visit fish shops in\nPanjim which I had heard about but had not yet seen. The occasion came\nwhen my 3-gear cycle broke down and I needed to go to Panjim to get\nspares. I tried to persuade my mother to get them for me from Panjim\nsince she went there often. She refused, saying that I should learn to\ndo things on my own. That’s when I thought of making a whole-day trip\nto Panjim to buy the spares, visit fish shops and also make a few\npurchases for Ashok.",
        "The next day, I accompanied my mum to Panjim where she showed me a few\nessential places and then left me on my own. I was a bit nervous but\nwas determined to manage somehow. I first went to the Kamat restaurant\nto eat as I was hungry. I was amazed at how much it cost me to fill my\nstomach outside home! After that, I searched for a shop from where I\ncould purchase silicone (Ashok’s errand). After a lot of asking around\nI found the place. Then I looked for the cycle shop, found it quickly\nenough but discovered that the item I wanted was out of stock and would\nbe available only the next week.",
        "I was then free to visit the two fish shops I had in mind: “Bislin” and\n\"Something Fishy”. Bislin was well stocked and had many types of exotic\nfish but I found it very expensive. I chatted with the people who ran\nthe shop (it is a family business). They also kept birds for sale.\nAfter watching the fish for sometime I decided to go to Something Fishy\nwhich was just around the corner. At Something Fishy, I was\ndisappointed at first sight to see very few fish. The shop assistant\ntold me that as they were expecting fish the following weekend almost\nall their tanks were empty. But what I saw remaining in the display\ntank amazed me. I saw man-eating piranhas with my own eyes for the\nfirst time in my life! However, the piranhas were quite timid and shy.\nApparently, it is only when they are kept hungry that they become\nferocious meat-eaters. Something Fishy also had exotic fish called\nBlack Ghost which sold at Rs.3000 a pair!",
        "Apart from learning about fish at Ashok’s shop I gained a lot of other\nvaluable experience.",
        "I had never done banking before. But one day Ashok casually asked me if\nI would go to his bank to withdraw some money. I didn’t feel like\ntelling him that I had no idea of how to go about doing this. Instead I\nasked for directions to the bank and set out. Somehow I figured my way\naround and got the job done. I was sent many times after that to the\nbank to deposit and withdraw money.",
        "Although I had all the time in the world at my disposal I found it was\nnot the easiest thing for me to effectively manage my time. Several\ntimes I would be speeding away on my bicycle to Ashok’s shop because I\nhad woken up late that morning. Or I had to push my lunch hour till\nlater because I had not completed all my tasks for the day. It was an\nexperience learning to plan my day properly and I would feel quite\npleased with myself when I got things right on my own.",
        "I also gained a lot of valuable insights into my own hobbies and\ninterests since for the first time in my life I was on my own and free\nto make decisions or experiment with ideas I thought worthwhile.",
        "I discovered that I have a great passion for reading books. I used to\ngo every morning to the library, on my way to Ashok’s shop, and pick up\nsomething to read during my free time. My favourite books were the\nHardy Boys and I finished practically the entire series while I was at\nAshok’s. I also enjoyed comics like Tintin and Phantom.",
        "Evenings, after I had finished with Ashok’s shop, I would listen to the\nFM radio music programmes. Like any other teenager, I like fast and\nloud music. Fortunately, my aunt Allison visiting us from Canada gave\nme a walkman which enabled me to play my music without disturbing the\nothers. I thought about starting to learn the guitar but my parents\nadvised against starting guitar lessons immediately as I had plans to\ntravel out of Goa in the coming months. Letter writing is not one of my\nfavourite things. However, I was forced to reply to the people who sent\nme letters and cash prizes, congratulating me on my examination\nresults. I was overjoyed to receive prompt replies from several of my\nrelatives and friends commending me on my choice of a year’s\nsabbatical. I also realised that you only get letters when you write to\npeople. However, I still don’t enjoy letter-writing.",
        "On Sundays, I used to do a few odd jobs to earn some pocket money. Like\nwashing the car for which I used to get five rupees from my dad. I was\nalso the main errand boy at home and I did all kinds of jobs like\npaying the electricity bills, buying the rations and so on.",
        "All in all, working at Ashok’s was a good beginning.",
        "Field Work Notes:\nNow Julie Has a Fish Tank",
        "Juliet and Peter D’Souza are college friends of my parents. They live\nat Calangute. Peter is a criminal lawyer and Juliet is a school\nteacher. Our families occasionally go on outings together. On one of\nthese picnics during my SSC year Juliet discovering my interest in\naquarium fish promptly tried to get me to assist her in setting up an\naquarium in their home.",
        "Actually they did have a fish tank earlier but the bottom glass had\ncracked and Juliet had given it to Ashok for repairs. And there it\nremained, in Ashok’s shop, with nobody attending to it. Juliet had\nreminded me on several occasions about the tank but there was little I\ncould do other than pass on her reminders to Ashok. When I started\nworking with Ashok I quickly took the opportunity of keeping my promise\nto her.",
        "The first problem was to find the tank. I began searching for it in the\nstoreroom of Ashok’s shop. I found it right at the bottom of all the\nother big tanks. I was relieved to see it still in one piece. Ashok and\nI then removed the broken bottom glass. We took the measurements and\nbought new glass from the glass shop. After fixing the tank, I went to\nPeter’s office and told him to pick it up and take it home whenever he\ncould.",
        "Peter came by and took it home the next evening. A few days later I\ncycled down to their house to set it up. Once there I realized that\nJuliet did not have any material for placing in the tank except a\nlittle gravel which was not enough to cover even the base of the tank.\nI explained to her all the essential items needed and she gave me a\nfreehand to purchase material and decorations for the tank. On my next\nvisit, I took a few kilos of gravel, a pump, plastic plants, fish\nmedicine, the undergravel filter, some pipeline, a few regulators,\nT-joints and a fishnet. I also took four types of aquarium toys and two\nshells for her to choose from.",
        "I started off with washing the gravel, then fixed the under-gravel\nfilter. I next poured gravel over the filter, and placed the\ndecorations of shells and toys on top. Then the tap and filters were\njoined to the air pump. All this while I was watched intently by\nAngelann and Miriam, Juliet’s two young daughters, who kept offering\nopinions or help here and there. After about two hours, everything was\nready. Only the fish and aquatic plants remained to be put in the\naquarium. The task of selecting the fish for the tank was not part of\nmy assignment as Julie said that she would buy the fish from a fish\nshop in Candolim. However, as she doubted whether live plants were sold\nin Candolim, she asked me to send her the plants through Peter. She\nalso told me to prepare a bill for her which I was to hand over to\nPeter. All this I did within the next two days.",
        "A week later, I had to visit Peter and Julie’s place to deliver a note\nto Peter from my dad. I was keen to see the fish she had bought and how\nthey were doing in the new home I had made for them. As a present I\ndecided to take five pairs of guppies from my garden tank. Imagine my\nshock when I found that the tank was just as I had left it, with no\nfish at all to inhabit the lovely quarters. I was glad I had brought\nalong the guppies and these became the first lot of fish to inhabit the\ntank. I also fixed the light and the regulators and set the plants\nproperly.",
        "Juliet’s little daughters crowded round me as I stood back to admire\nthe now complete aquarium: fish swimming happily with newly installed\nplants and air filters bubbling away in a corner. Juliet soon joined us\nand thanked me warmly and to my utter surprise slipped a 50 rupee note\ninto my pocket. I protested that she should not pay me for this as I\nwas having great fun but she insisted that I take the money and this\nbecame my first earning.",
        "In similar fashion I set up fish tanks for a few other family friends.\nBesides having a lot of fun and gaining valuable experience, I also\nearned pocket money! Avdoot and Rekha Munj in Mapusa have a lovely big\ntank which I helped set up for their daughter; Alvito and Celine\nSantiago from Parra also had an empty fish tank which they wanted to\nput back in use and I organised the fish for them too.",
        "There was also the large fish tank in the office of the Principal of my\nschool (St. Anthony’s at Monte Guirim), which I had maintained during\nmy school days. I continued to keep watch over it through my younger\nbrother Milind, who, like me, is also a fish fan.",
        "One of my plans for the rainy season was to go to RUSTIC Farm which is\nin Thanem, a small village near Valpoi in the remote north-eastern\ndistrict of Sattari, so that I could gain some experience in farming.\nRUSTIC Farm holds a special attraction for me because I was born when\nmy parents lived on this farm and we stayed there till I was three\nyears old. Although I have no real recollection of that period, we have\nmany photographs of my baby days on the farm and many stories that my\nparents tell us of those times. We still visit the place at least once\na year and also maintain contact with several of the villagers who\nworked then on the farm. Yesu, our domestic help for the past 16 years\ncomes from that area. In 1985 RUSTIC Farm was sold to the present\nowners Shyam and Ujwala Achrekar. I had intended to stay with them for\na month and learn about farming first-hand. Unfortunately due to some\npersonal difficulties they could not have me visit them. It is one of\nthe few regrets I had during my one-year sabbatical. As things worked\nout, however, I was able to learn a few basics about farming in my own\nvillage at Parra.",
        "My neighbours, the Kandolkars, are a peasant family and during the\nrains they take to farming their own fields. They also do ploughing\nwork for others. Guru, the eldest son, has a fine pair of bullocks for\nthe purpose. It so happened that Guru was doing some masonry work at\nour house and I was chatting with him about my sabbatical when he\ncasually asked me whether I would like to come ploughing with him. I\njumped at the offer even as he seemed a bit surprised that I had so\nreadily agreed. Next morning I was woken up early and we set out for\nthe fields which are quite close to our homes.",
        "Holding the plough may appear a simple task but believe me it is not so\nand calls for quite a lot of skill and stamina. The trick is to keep\nthe plough in the centre and avoid cutting the hoofs of the animals at\nthe same time. One needs to put the right amount of pressure on the\nhandle as the plough should neither be too deep nor too shallow in the\nsoil. Also one has to constantly keep one’s eye on the bullocks to\ndirect them to turn around at the end of the field and to lift the\nplough when it reaches a bund. Lastly (and this is most important) the\nbullocks must recognise you or else they won’t take orders from you.",
        "The bullocks knew Guru very well but I was a stranger so Guru made me\nkeep shouting cries of “heeree heeree” which is how they get the\nanimals to move-so that they would at least begin to recognise my\nvoice. Although I went ploughing with Guru for several days in a row,\nhe never let me plough on my own because getting the right balance was\nstill very difficult for me and if any of the bullocks got hurt due to\nmy inexperience he would have to give the animal at least 15 days’ rest\nwhich would cost him heavily in earnings.",
        "After the ploughing is done the ground has to be levelled for seeding.\nThis is also done by the bullocks who drag a wooden piece shaped like a\nbroad fork across the field. This I was allowed to do on my own and I\nenjoyed it thoroughly. It was like having a nice ride, standing on the\nwooden leveller while the bullocks went up and down the field.",
        "I also tried my hand at spraying seeds and later fertilizer, on the\nfields. Sometimes I did a bit of weeding, to while away the time\nin-between ploughing. On some days when we were ploughing it used to\nrain heavily and I enjoyed working in the rain with all the other\nfarmers. After ploughing we would be treated to hot tea and bread or\npao baji by the owner of the field.",
        "I recall how surprised the owners of the fields we had ploughed would\nbe on seeing me sitting with the other workers-dirty with mud like\nthem-because naturally, they recognised me, since I am from the same\nvillage. One lady, in fact, thought I was playing truant. She told me\nshe was going to inform my mother where I was that Sunday morning. She\nthought that I ought to have been in church attending Mass instead.",
        "The field work was a good experience and one which I cherish. I helped\nGuru plough about half a dozen fields and even now when the rainy\nseason approaches I remember that experience with warmth and pleasure.",
        "The rainy season brings out the average Goan’s passion ate love for\nplants and some of this fervour and enthusiasm finds its way into plant\nexhibitions and plant festivals. I would like to recount my experiences\nwith two of them-at Saligao and at Siolim-two villages close to where I\nlive. At the first I was a mere spectator but played a more active role\nin the second.",
        "Saligao\nSunday, the 1st of July, was an unusually bright day for the normally\ndull, wet, cloudy rainy season. I was looking forward to going to\nSaligao to see an exhibition of plants and was glad for the dry weather\nas I pedalled the 20 minutes it took to reach Lourdes Convent, the well\nknown school in the village where the exhibition was being held. I\nreached around 10.30 in the morning. The exhibition had already been\ninaugurated and the place was crowded with people all trying to enter\nthe main hall where the exhibits were kept. I too did likewise.",
        "The main exhibition hall was quite big and the plants were exhibited in\npots in the centre of the hall. Many of the plants were for sale. They\nhad been brought there by different people and most of the pots had the\nnames of their owners on them. The cacti were grouped together on a\ntable on one side of the hall and the prize winning exhibits of the\nflower arrangement competition on another. I noticed that the first\nprize had been given to a flower arrangement done inside a painted\nscooter tyre. I thought this a really unusual idea. The two most\nattractive and unusual cacti were ones on exhibit: while one had a thin\ngreen base and a bright red lumpy top the other was like a cotton puff.",
        "Besides the plants in the hall some classrooms alongside were also\noccupied with plants and other items for sale. There were food plants\nlike coriander and coconut seedlings, ornamental plants such as money\nplants, creepers, and indoor decorative plants. There were also garden\nimplements including spraying tools, cutters, flowerpots, seed packets\nand organic manures.",
        "At eleven o’clock there was an announcement that there would be a talk\ngiven by Mr Francis Borges, the topic being `Organic Farming’. Francis\nBorges is a college lecturer but is better known for his experience and\nknowledge of plants. He practises organic farming and has a nursery\ncalled Apurbai. He used to write a weekly column in a Goan paper the\n\"Weekender”. My dad had already told me about him so I was eager to\nhear what he had to say.",
        "His talk dealt with the consequences of using chemicals (pesticides,\ninsecticides, fertilizers) which he said was a recent happening in the\nworld. He stressed the need to return to organic farming which he said\nwas the only sensible way of farming. He also spoke about the role of\nearthworms as friends of the farmer.",
        "Many questions followed. Most of these dealt with problems people faced\nwhile gardening at home. Mr Borges in his reply offered practical\nsolutions which he himself had tried out successfully. For example, to\nthe query, “Why does a papaya plant die after flowering?” he suggested\nbuilding a bund round the base of the plant because water collecting\nthere rots the papaya base stem. In this connection he also spoke of a\nmedicine which he and his colleagues had invented to drastically reduce\nthe diseases which attack papaya. He markets this as “Papaya Cure”. By\naround noon the talk ended and I left for home.",
        "Siolim\nThe plant exhibition at Saligao had given me an idea of what to expect\nat the next plant festival I attended, which was at Siolim. Here I took\nan active part thanks to the invitation I received from Alexyz, the\nwell known Goan cartoonist, who was in charge of the Siolim Plant\nFestival called “Green Heritage”. Green Heritage was started by Alexyz\nand his friends a few years ago and it has proved to be an enormous\nsuccess with people eagerly awaiting the event each year.",
        "I woke up early on the morning of August 11th, 1995 and pedalled away\nto Siolim, which is a picturesque village across the hill from Parra. I\nfound myself sitting at Alexyz’s doorstep much earlier than expected.\nAlexyz and his wife Tecla arrived home in time for lunch. After lunch,\nI hopped on the back of Alexyz’s Kinetic Honda and we set off to visit\nthe homes of all those participating in the exhibition, informing them\nto keep their exhibits ready for us to collect the next day.",
        "I woke up on the 12th morning to the sound of Alexyz’s gibberish much\nlike scatman’s scat. “Come on man, let’s get going”, he yelled. He was\na college friend of my parents and he is one of the funniest people I\nknow. Just being in his company is one big laugh!",
        "Our task that morning was to collect the plant exhibits from the homes\nof all those on our list. The tempo arrived at 9.30 a.m. We covered the\nbase of the tempo with shrubs to act as cushions for the potted plants.\nWe had a long list of homes to visit. Each time we picked up an item\nfor the exhibition we tagged and numbered it so we would know the\ncorrect house to return the pot to later. We had to be careful at some\nhouses otherwise we might have ended with torn pants ripped up by the\nhuge Dobermans people owned.",
        "When the tempo could carry no more we would return to SFX school where\nthe exhibition was to be held in order to unload the pots and start out\nagain. Each round was an experience of new people, new homes, new\ngardens. On one round we visited the famous pop singer Remo’s house.\nHis mother was taking part in the exhibition.",
        "It took us all day to complete the list and we eventually made three\ntrips round the village. We then arranged the pots on the benches in\nthe school hall. Miguel Braganza (an agricultural officer of the\nGovernment who at that time was posted to the Indian Council of\nAgricultural Research in Old Goa) and Francis Borges (the same person\nwho gave the talk on organic farming at the Saligao Plant Exhibition)\nwere also there along with several other village boys and girls all\nhelping in various ways to set up the show which was to begin the next\nmorning. In fact by the time we finished it was already one a.m. of the\n13th. We would have only a few hours of sleep before we would all be on\nduty again at 9 a.m. to complete the last minute jobs before the\nfestival got started.",
        "The Green Heritage Plant Festival lasted three days. The Director of\nthe Agricultural Department, Mr P.K. Desai, inaugurated it at 11 a.m\n(instead of a ribbon to be cut between the doors of the exhibition,\nthere was a creeper). He also released a book titled, Green Aid\nIII-Total Gardening that the Green Heritage had published. The book was\nwrapped up in a large money plant leaf instead of wrapping paper. I\nthought this an unusual and apt idea. After the inauguration and the\nrelease of the book, the official made his speech which was followed by\na funny speech made by Alexyz.",
        "The Green Heritage programme had several aspects: (i) the exhibition,\n(ii) lectures and talks on different subjects and (iii) competitions of\ndifferent kinds-all related to the green world.",
        "The main exhibition hall was very big and it was filled with all kinds\nof plants, arranged in such a manner that people could move around\neasily and view the plants without too much difficulty. Altogether\nthere must have been about two hundred pots. There were vegetable\nplants such as chillies and brinjals. There were flowering plants,\ncacti, creepers, ferns, bonsai of Banyan trees, peepal trees, etc.\nThere were also lime trees, orange trees and chickoo trees all growing\nin pots.",
        "On the stage in the hall, competition exhibits-vegetable-carving crafts\nand flower-making crafts of students from different schools-were kept.",
        "Outside the hall there were two corridors. In one corridor the\ngovernment nursery was stationed, where neem, mango, coconut, chickoo,\ntamarind, cashew and some other kinds of trees were being sold. Along\nthe other corridor a variety of other items were kept on sale: a small\ntable held copies of the book, Total Gardening as well as the previous\ntwo volumes released at the earlier exhibitions by the Green Heritage;\nanother table held beautiful coconut handicrafts for sale. There was an\nelephant head, a table lamp, a skull, all made out of different parts\nof a coconut. Next to this, The Other India Bookstore had set up a\nstall with a large variety of environment titles. Further down was the\nGarden Glory stall selling various types of garden implements such as\nlawn movers, cutters, sprayers and other accessories. Apurbhai had a\nvariety of organic manures like leaf mould, Karanji and bone meal\nbesides ornamental plants, palms and creepers. There were pickles,\nsquashes and medicine for papaya plants also on sale.",
        "At the far end of the corridor was the canteen. Here, whenever we were\nthirsty or hungry, we went and had a cold drink or some snacks. I\ndidn’t have to worry about my bill, because it was taken care of by the\nGreen Heritage group.",
        "Next to the canteen, there was a small table, a blackboard, some chalk\nand some benches. This was where the programme of lectures and talks\nwas held. Altogether there were four talks given during the Green\nHeritage Programme: on vegetable carving, jams and squashes,\nwine-making, and cacti.",
        "I decided to attend the talk given on cacti by a person who grew cacti\nin his flat. His talk was extremely interesting and full of practical\ninformation and handy hints on how to grow cacti. Although I have not\ntried my hand at growing cacti, yet I took down detailed notes which I\nshared with my mother, who as I correctly thought was very happy to get\nthe information as it helped her in her little cacti rock garden. And\nit certainly was a very educative talk for me.",
        "All through the three days I was assigned simple jobs like watching\nover the plants in the main hall, watering the plants, carrying pots\nand furniture around, handling the sales of the Green Heritage\nbooklets, and so on. And with Alexyz around each task was great fun.",
        "On the last day, there was the prize distribution ceremony. I was proud\nand happy to receive a special certificate for having assisted in the\nGreen Heritage Festival. As the fair came to an end the organisers all\nfelt that it was yet another successful event. I was happy to have been\na part of it. But the fun was not yet over for we all had a barbecue\ndinner that evening that lasted well into the early hours of the\nmorning. We slept only briefly for there remained the final task of\nreturning the pot exhibits to their respective owners. This we\ncommenced early next morning.",
        "I had enjoyed my work at the Green Heritage and my stay at Alexyz’s\nhouse. I was indeed sad when it all ended. I rested the next day at\nAlexyz’s house and on the 18th morning, left for home.",
        "Field Work Notes:\nGrowing Cacti At Home",
        "Cacti are plants suited to the desert and we must keep this factor in\nmind always when growing ornamental cacti in our gardens, for it helps\nin the survival of the plant. For example, a cactus should never be\nwatered over its body as it will start to rot. This is because it is\ncovered with a waxy coating which prevents water loss through\nevaporation. When one waters the cactus over its body, the waxy coating\nis washed away and the plant begins to rot. The amount of water that\nyou must supply to the cactus is very much dependent upon the season\nand upon the climate of the place. During the summer season one should\nwater cacti every four days whereas in the rainy season once every\nfifteen days is quite enough.",
        "Cacti need a minimum of two and a half hours of sunlight per day.\nHowever they should not be kept all day in the sun because they may\nwrinkle in too much of bright sunlight. Unlike other plants cacti\nproduce carbon dioxide during the day and oxygen during the night.\nHence, they are ideal plants to be kept in bedrooms to freshen up the\nair at night.",
        "If the cactus plant is to thrive and prosper, the size of the pot in\nwhich it is grown has to be carefully monitored. The pot should always\nbe a little smaller than the plant itself because it is only when the\nplant has to struggle to survive that it will thrive. If the pot is too\nspacious the struggle element is removed and the chances are that the\ncactus will die. Cacti are like human beings. When they suffer they\nwill grow. Similarly if a cactus shows no signs of growth, stop the\nwatering. It should be resumed only when the plant resumes growth.",
        "The substrata of a cactus pot is ideally composed of pieces of broken\nbricks at the bottom, charcoal above it, then coarse sand and pebbles\nabove it. Leaf mould is the best manure.",
        "Grafting of cacti is very simple. A very small piece of the cactus\nplant should be stuck with cellotape to the plant that needs grafting.\nThe smaller the piece the easier it is to graft. To reproduce cacti,\none has to simply cut off a piece of the cactus, allow it to dry for a\nfew days and then just place it over the cacti substrate. It will\nautomatically develop roots.",
        "To differentiate between cacti and other plants that look like cacti is\nvery easy. All cacti have fine hair at the base of each thorn. The\nso-called thorns are in fact highly modified leaves which prevent loss\nof water through transpiration. If one ever gets pricked by cacti\nthorns, one should take cellotape, place it over the area where the\nthorns have penetrated the skin and then peel it off. All the thorns\nwill get stuck to the cellotape and will be removed.",
        "Attending the Green Heritage plant festival in Siolim had one more\nadvantage for me. It brought me into contact with Mr Miguel Braganza,\nan agricultural officer of the Goa Government. It was through him that\nI learnt of a two-day course on mushrooms to be conducted by the Indian\nCouncil of Agricultural Research (ICAR) at Ela Farm, Old Goa in the\nlast week of August.",
        "This programme also marked the beginning of my experience in getting\naround on my own. For, although the course was conducted in Goa itself\nI had never been to Ela Farm nor did I know anyone at the programme.",
        "Mr Braganza had informed me that participants would be offered free\naccommodation on the campus. However, it was not compulsory to stay\nthere. I assumed that most people would avail of the accommodation\nfacilities offered since late evening transport is not very good in\nGoa. At any rate I enjoy camping out and so I asked my parents if I\ncould spend the night on the campus. They agreed. My assumption however\nproved wrong as I turned out to be the only residential participant!",
        "Anyway, on the morning of 24th August, after taking directions from my\ndad, I left for the ICAR at Old Goa which is about 22 kms from my home.\nI arrived there without any difficulty. The ICAR is located within Ela\nfarm. At the gate I had to fill in a gate pass. Down the right lane was\nthe ICAR office. On either side of the road were coconut, guava and\nchickoo plantations. Further down was a small office which looked more\nlike a lab with various specimens of preserved mushroom. I enquired\nabout the course with the man in charge and was directed to the Farmers\nTraining Centre.",
        "Mr Miguel Braganza and Mr Oscar-the two persons conducting the\ncourse-were already there and so were some of the participants. We were\nfirst made to register our names for the course and immediately after\nand to my total surprise we were informed that each of us would receive\na stipend of Rs.500 for attending the course. This appears to be a sort\nof bonus or incentive which is provided to the participants and is\nmeant to cover expenses for transport, food, etc.",
        "I noticed that all the other participants (there were thirty-three\nother students) were older than me. Most of them were farmers, so all\nthe people who gave talks either spoke part English and part Konkani,\nor if the lecturers spoke only English then Oscar would translate into\nKonkani.",
        "The course which basically comprised lectures and demonstrations\nstarted with a talk by the tall, thin, long-haired Nandakumar Kamat.\nHis first question was: “What do you want to cultivate mushrooms for?\nKitchen gardening, small scale production or large scale export?\"\nDepending on your objectives you can decide on the variety and the\nquantity, he told us. His talk included slides of different varieties\nof mushrooms, poisonous and non poisonous.",
        "The talk was lengthy but very interesting. It ended well past lunch\ntime and most of the participants including myself were happy to go\nstraight to a meal at the FTC canteen where a delicious fish curry\nthali could be purchased for just Rs.6.",
        "The second session began at three in the afternoon. There were two\ntalks in this session, the first by a scientist from the ICAR who spoke\non pests and diseases that attack mushrooms. Among the problem areas he\nmentioned insects, fungi, bacteria and improper management.",
        "Unfortunately most of the remedies he suggested were limited to\nspraying of insecticides and pesticides such as lindane, malathion\ndichlorose, copper sulphate or citronella oil. To be fair, he also laid\nstress on proper management and hygiene as an effective way to reduce\ndiseases. Since none of us had ever grown mushrooms before there were\nnot many questions or doubts raised at the end of his lecture.",
        "Then there was a talk by a woman who explained to us the nutritional\nvalue of mushrooms. For half an hour she spoke on the low fat and sugar\ncontent of mushrooms and how mushrooms prevent pain in joints of bones,\ntooth decay and bleeding gums. It made me feel that I should make\nmushrooms my staple diet!",
        "The programme for the day ended at 6 p.m. That’s when I was surprised\nto discover that everyone was going home and I was the only residential\nparticipant. I decided to stay the night anyway since the organisers\ntold me that adequate arrangements had been made for anyone wishing to\ndo so.",
        "I spent the evening and early in the morning the next day looking\naround the campus. I noticed that the ICAR had a small nursery, a\nflower garden, a small fish pond, pens for small animals such as\nrabbits and chickens, cattle sheds and vast paddy fields. There was\nalso an orchard with a variety of fruit trees such as mango, chickoo,\ncoconut palms etc.",
        "In the midst of all this greenery were the residential buildings with\nthe canteen in between. I occupied one of the rooms on the first floor\nof the four-storey building. It was a small room, with two beds, a few\nlockers, a table and a mirror. Since there was no one else staying the\nnight, the watchman was asked to stay with me for company. The canteen\nserved good and cheap meals. I had already eaten there in the afternoon\nwith the others. For the night the cook prepared some fish curry rice\nfor me. The next morning I had a breakfast of bread and vegetables for\nthree rupees only. That night, not having much to do, the watchman and\nI decided to walk up the hill at the back of the campus, at the top of\nwhich was a temple.",
        "Most of the second day was conducted by Oscar. Oscar’s presentation was\nmore of a practical exercise. He gave very practical information on how\nto grow mushrooms and interspersed his talk with slides and live\ndemonstrations. He showed us the inoculation and culture room for\ntissue culture as well as the ultraviolet tube where the mother spawn\nis prepared. Rushing up and down the lab and the lecture hall we were\nshown how straw is boiled, how the mushroom bags are filled, and so on.\nWe were allowed to actively participate and fill in the bags ourselves.\nAll the participants enjoyed Oscar’s session and wished it could have\nbeen longer.",
        "None of the participants had any experience with growing mushrooms for\ncommercial purposes so Oscar had invited two people who grew mushrooms\nfor the local market as well as for export purposes to address us. They\nhad been growing mushrooms for the past one year, selling them fresh or\ndried according to the demand and they gave us very practical\ninformation based on their personal experience. They said that they\nfilled two hundred bags of straw everyday. They told us of the problems\nthey faced with pests (mainly rats) and diseases and also the\ndifficulties they initially faced when selling mushrooms. The programme\nfinally concluded with a speech by the Director of the Farmers’\nTraining Centre who told us about the general activities of the FTC and\nthe ICAR.",
        "Some of the students took spawn-filled bottles home. I didn’t, because\nI knew I wouldn’t be in a position to get into action immediately as my\ntravel plans for getting out of Goa for the next few months were\nalready underway.",
        "So although I didn’t really get into the act of mushrooms-growing, I\nlearnt much and also made many friends.",
        "Field Work Notes:\nHow to Grow Mushrooms",
        "There are many varieties of edible mushrooms, of which the oyster and\nbutton mushrooms are the most popular with both the mushroom\ncultivators and the general public.",
        "Mushrooms can be eaten by anyone including children since they are\neasily digested and absorbed by the body into the bloodstream within\ntwo to three hours. They contain iron, vitamins, calcium and protein.\nThey are especially good for pregnant mothers, and diabetic and blood\npressure patients. Mushrooms have medicinal properties and are known to\nreduce heart, liver and blood diseases including cholesterol and\nstomach cancer.",
        "Mushrooms can be profitably grown using little investment. However one\nhas to master the techniques and follow all the procedures and\nrequirements very carefully. One does not need land to become a\nmushroom cultivator for one can grow mushrooms even in one’s own house.",
        "Climate: Mushrooms require a temperature of 20-32o Celsius and about\n35-90% humidity. They also require adequate ventilation, diffused light\nand semi-darkness. Too much light makes mushrooms dark in colour.",
        "If the room temperature increases above 32oC, it should be decreased by\nhanging wet sacks around the place. However the sacks should be first\nsterilized using savlon, formalin or dettol to avoid fungi or bacteria\nentering the room. If the temperature decreases below 20oC, then a 200W\nbulb (for a small room) should be lit to generate heat.",
        "Spawn: Mushrooms are grown from spawn. The colour of good spawn is\nmilky white with a sweet smell or no smell. The spawn should be\ncompact, white on all sides and cottony. If it is yellow, it means that\nthe spawn is old. Any other coloured patches seen on the spawn signify\ncontaminant fungi in the spawn. Spawn should be maximum 18 to 20 days\nold.",
        "To prepare mother spawn, one needs good quality jowar, wheat or gram.\nThe seed should be of uniform size, good quality, free from pests and\ndiseases and dry. The grain should be washed, all hollow grains should\nbe removed and the remaining boiled for one hour so that it is half\ncooked. While boiling some formalin or savlon should be added to\ndisinfect the grain. The grain is then spread on a disinfected muslin\ncloth and mixed with calcium carbonate. It is then filled into bottles\nwhich are tightly corked using nonabsorbent cotton. The bottles are\nthen put into a pressure cooker.",
        "The inoculation or the culture room for tissue culture was also shown\nto us. This room should be about 2.25 m in height and 1.25 m in length.\nTwo tubes i.e. an ultra-violet tube and a normal tube light are used. A\nspirit lamp is also used. One can produce up to six generations from\none bottle of mother spawn with the help of tissue culture. After six\ngenerations the strength of the spawn decreases and the yield of the\nmushrooms will be less.",
        "Substratum: Paddy straw is the main substratum used for growing\nmushrooms-it contains cellulose and lignin, both of which are necessary\nfor the growth of mushrooms. However many other kinds of substrata are\nalso used, for example, saw dust, sacks, banana leaves, dry mango\nleaves, coconut leaves, sugarcane, wild grass, rice husk, etc.",
        "The paddy straw must be carefully selected. It should be brittle,\nyellow or golden brown in colour and not older than 6 months. The straw\nshould be dried in the sun for several days, stored if necessary in an\nair-tight container and used within two months. The ratio of paddy\nstraw to mushroom spawn should be 1 kg “prepared” straw to 4% spawn.",
        "Procedure: First the straw must be prepared. The straw should be cut to\n3-5 cm pieces. It should then be filled in cloth bags and soaked in\nwater (1 kg straw to 10 litres water) for 10 hours. The straw should be\nweighted down in the water so that no part of it remains above the\nlevel of water.",
        "The next stage is pasteurization. Water must be boiled to a temperature\nof 80 to 85oC. When bubbles appear, the soaked straw, surrounded by the\ncloth bags, should be weighted down and fully immersed in water. The\nbubbles will disappear when the straw is immersed and then reappear.\nThirty minutes after the reappearance of bubbles the straw should be\nremoved. It should be drained of water and cooled at room temperature,\nthen spread out on a clean surface and dried for two hours.",
        "The moisture content of the straw should not exceed 60%. To judge the\nmoisture content one should hold some straw between one’s fingers and\nsqueeze tightly. If only one drop of water comes out, then the moisture\ncontent is correct.",
        "Polythene or polypropylene bags are now required to fill the straw\ninto. The bags should be approximately 35 x 50 cm and should weigh 150\ngms each. Before using them, they should be washed with savlon or\ndettol or formalin. Four strings should be tied together at one end\nwhich should be placed at the bottom of the bag. The four free ends\nmust be held outside the bag. The bag can now be filled. First a 5 cm\nlayer of straw should be put in and the straw pressed lightly against\nthe bottom. Mushroom spawn should then be spread over it. Then another\n10 cm layer of straw, over which the spawn should be spread and so on\ntill one reaches the top of the bag. Finally it must be covered with a\nfinal 5 cm layer of straw, and the four pieces of string and the bag\nmust be tied together. The bags can either be kept on the ground or\nhung in the room. Hanging them enables one to get at the mushrooms from\nthe bottom of the bag easily.",
        "The following day, 30 to 35 holes should be made in each bag with a\nsterile needle. The bags should be kept in darkness, with very little\nventilation allowed to them, for 15 days. The bags should then be moved\nto another room. Here they should get four hours of diffused light and\ncross ventilation. After one and a half days the substrate should be\nsprayed with water three times a day with a shower pointing upwards so\nthat the water falls on the bags like rain. On the following day small\nmushrooms, the size of pinheads will appear. Two days later fully grown\nmushrooms will appear. The mushrooms should not be pulled out because\nthe substrata will also be pulled out with it. Instead they should be\ncut or twisted and broken off from the base. If the substrata is dry\nthe bag should be given a quick dip in water. Otherwise continue\nspraying with water. The second crop of mushrooms will reappear one\nweek later. The process can be continued upto 4 times. Then one has to\nstart afresh. This is because after 4 crops the substrata begin to\nattract disease and get contaminated.",
        "Pests and Diseases: Mushrooms are easily attacked by pests and diseases\nand therefore require utmost care and good management. Of the two well\nknown types of mushrooms, the button mushroom is more prone to disease\nwhereas the oyster mushroom is hardier.",
        "Insects which attack mushrooms are the Scearid fly, the Phosid fly,\nSpring Tails (small insects like grasshoppers) and mites. To prevent\ninsects from attacking mushrooms it is best to keep the mushroom bags\nat least one foot above the ground. One can burn sulphur in the room\nbefore seeding the mushrooms. Citronella oil mixed with water can also\nbe used for spraying on the bags. It is absolutely essential to\nmaintain the highest standards of hygiene to prevent attack by insects.",
        "Bacteria and nematodes are other causes for worry. Bacteria occur when\nthere is too much humidity and this shows in a wet rot or a brown\nblotch. To avoid this problem it is essential to constantly monitor the\nhumidity level and maintain it as required. To prevent the occurrence\nof nematodes, the substrata should be constantly changed-it should\nnever be older than six months to one year. The straw must be carefully\nselected and should be disinfected thoroughly before use. 100 gms of\npotassium permanganate, or 20 ml of formalin should be sprayed on the\nbags if the disease should appear.",
        "It was now the end of August and also the end of the heavy rains. I was\neager to begin travelling out of Goa to visit the many places on my\nagenda. I had got fairly comfortable now with being on my own within\nGoa (where I could at least communicate in the same language with\nanyone I met) asking for directions, buying myself a meal and learning\nto handle small quantities of money. I therefore impatiently awaited my\ntrip out of Goa.",
        "Another reason for my wanting to travel was because I was fed up of my\nneighbours and friends constantly asking me what I was doing after my\nSSC and why I was not in college. Somehow they couldn’t get used to the\nidea that I was enjoying myself learning the things I wanted to on my\nown, so I would be constantly badgered by queries. I thought that if I\nwent away I would certainly escape all these queries.",
        "It so happened that my father was attending a seminar on organic\nfarming in Kottayam and as he would also be visiting some organic farms\nhe thought it a good idea if I came along. The trip would take us to\nKerala.",
        "Dad and I left Goa on 30th August, 1995. The bus departed from Panaji\nbus stand at six a.m. and reached Mangalore the same day at four in the\nevening. En route we passed through Karwar, Ankola, Kumta, Honavar,\nKundapur and Udupi. Mangalore happens to be my ancestral home. (My dad,\nthough born and brought up in Mumbai and now living since marriage in\nGoa, is originally from Mangalore.) Although we do not have an\nancestral home any more we have lots of relatives in Mangalore city.",
        "We stayed at my grand uncle’s house which is very close to the\nbus-stand. It is a two storey building in the heart of Mangalore and my\ngrand aunt Monica Mauxi lives there with her three sons, Reggie,\nPatrick and Lambert and their families in a sort of joint family\nset-up. My grand uncle J.S. Alvares who was a very well known Konkani\nwriter passed away a few years ago. I was meeting my aunt and cousins\nalmost for the first time.",
        "After the introductions were over and we had had tea and snacks Dad\nshowed me around the city. Since I knew that I would be returning to\nGoa alone at the end of the seminar in Kottayam I took care to be very\nobservant about landmarks and other details so that I would not get\nlost on my return trip. I carefully noted the locations of the railway\nstation, Hampankatta, which is the centre of Mangalore and the old bus\nstand and the route to Aunt Monica’s home. We returned at dark to a\nsplendid meal and went to bed early for we had to wake up at 3 a.m. for\nour onward journey.",
        "Our train left Mangalore on the dot at 4.15 a.m. We travelled all day\nthrough green countryside, passing through Kannur, Calicut, Thrissur\nand Ernakulam to reach our destination Kottayam at 3.45 p.m. We were\nbooked at Hotel Aishwarya. I had a refreshing bath and then as usual we\nwent off to explore the city but had to return soon because it started\nto rain.",
        "The seminar was at Hotel Green Park and we set out for the venue early\nin the morning. We had already been registered as participants and each\nof us was given a cloth bag, notebook and pen to use during the\nseminar. There were many stalls selling a large number of items from\norganic tea and pickles, to books and manuals.",
        "We looked around very briefly for the organisers were already calling\nout to everyone to settle down for the inaugural. All day there were\ntalks, most of them by scientists. The sessions continued till evening\nwith a break for a vegetarian lunch in between. Of all the talks, the\none that caught my attention was the talk given by Dr Sultan Ismail on\nearthworms. I have refrained from giving details of Dr Ismail’s talk\nhere because I have a full chapter on my association with his work\nlater in this book.",
        "The next morning the same sort of programme continued. However there\nwas a farmer’s session which was chaired by my father. Many farmers\nspoke about their experience in organic farming. I found it quite\ninteresting. Sometime after lunch my father and I, along with Guru\nRishi Prabhakar (the founder of the Siddha Samadhi Yoga programme) and\nKartikeyan (who was researching some chapters for a source book on\norganic farming) left to visit the farm of an organic farmer, a Mr.\nK.T. Thomas. He showed us his shrimp pond, rubber plantations, cows,\nfishing ponds, orchids, giant bamboo filter ponds, etc. His farm was\nreally huge, dark and damp-like a forest in the night!",
        "Next morning we took a train to Calicut. We passed through Ernakulam\nand Trishur. At Shoranur we changed trains and from the railway station\nwe took a bus to Sultan’s Battery where we spent the night at a hotel\ncalled the Resort. As usual, we spent enjoyable hours walking around\nthe town.",
        "The next programme was at Wynad. Here, another meeting of persons\ninterested in organic farming was taking place. We stayed at the Wynad\nWildlife Division Guest House.",
        "The group here was not very large and they generally had small intense\ndiscussions. I was not much interested in the sessions and wandered\nabout as I pleased. But I liked the company of the people there very\nmuch for all of them were very knowledgeable and they were the active\ntype too. Some of them-like Bernard from Auroville, Korah Mathen and\nhis daughter Nidhi from Ahmedabad and Omkar-I would meet again during\nmy sabbatical year.",
        "We used to go for long walks in the forest, morning and evening. On the\nfirst day itself we saw Nilgiri Langurs and a variety of small birds,\nfrogs and trees.",
        "In the evening the organisers showed us two movies on the pollution of\nthe river Bhavani. After that we watched a very popular and lovely\nmovie called `Animals are Beautiful People’.",
        "On our early morning walk the following day (the second at Wynad) we\nsaw a herd of spotted deer and a barking deer. We also saw many\nfootprints of animals, especially of deer; and traces of elephant\nfootprints too. The experience excited me very much and after that I\nwould eagerly set out with whoever was interested in taking a walk. On\nthe third day, a Mr Shivanand gave a very interesting talk on the\nWestern Ghats. He showed us many slides on the Western Ghats i.e.\ninsectivorous plants, mountain goats, rivers that are formed by\ncondensation of water vapour, plants that flower every ten years, etc.\nAll that I had studied in geography and science in school now came\nalive for me.",
        "That evening we watched two movies, one called `The Whistling Hunters’\n(about wild dogs) and another called `The Lord of the Jungle’ (about\nelephants). Both were very good. The next morning we went walking again\nand saw only birds. We walked about 12 kms that day. Later that morning\nthe concluding session of the programme was held.",
        "In the evening the forest department organised a tour for us through\nthe jungle. We walked quite a distance, saw the watchtower, then deer\nand a wild boar, but we had to turn back soon because we saw tiger\nfootprints. At night we saw another two movies, one on the Narmada\ncalled `A Valley Rises’ and the second called `The Silent Valley’.",
        "After the meeting ended my dad was scheduled to go to Chennai for some\nwork but I was to return to Goa on my own. My dad came along with me by\nbus to Calicut. At the railway station, my father bought me a ticket to\nMangalore and left me at the station at about 2 p.m. to await the train\nwhich was due at around 4 p.m.",
        "It was the first time I was travelling alone and I was quite nervous.\nAlthough it would be two hours before the train arrived I dared not\nfall asleep. I had with me a small battery operated video game and I\noccupied myself with this while waiting for the train to arrive. When\nit did there was a general commotion as people started rushing into the\ncompartments. I enquired with one or two persons whether there were any\nspecial seats but nobody was really willing to pay attention so I just\nfound myself a nice spot and settled down. The train started soon\nthereafter.",
        "I stayed fully alert during the entire journey, keeping a watch on my\nthings (I carried a haversack and a sleeping bag, both new) and having\nheard about pickpockets and other thieves I wanted to be doubly\ncareful. I did not get down at any of the railway stations as I was not\nsure how long the train would stop. So I contented myself with eating\nthe fruit that Dad had bought for me at the Calicut station.",
        "The train arrived in Mangalore at 9 p.m. From the station I took a\nrickshaw to my grand aunt’s house for which I paid thirty rupees. This\nwas quite a lot of money, but since it was night-time and since I was\nnot perfectly confident of the route I did not bother to argue with the\nrickshaw-wallah.",
        "My aunt and family were pleased to see me and urged me to stay on for a\nfew days. But I knew that my mother would be anxiously awaiting my\nreturn, and not wanting to be irresponsible, I decided to return as\nplanned the next day itself.",
        "In the morning my cousin Reggie took me on his scooter to the bus\nstation where we saw a bus about to depart for Goa. I jumped in and\nmanaged to get the last empty seat. The bus reached Panaji at 5 p.m.\nFrom there I took the local bus to Mapusa. Only when the bus reached\nthe Mapusa bus terminus was I finally on familiar territory. I looked\naround at the familiar street dogs and hawker stands and then hailed a\nmotorcycle taxi to take me home, which was a short distance of 3 kms.",
        "Back home I proudly walked up to my mum who was smiling a welcome, my\nbrothers punching me, my dog licking me-all so far away from the world\nof elephants and tiger footprints.",
        "It took several letters and phone calls from my dad to establish\ncontact with Mr Neelimkumar Khaire, Director of the Snake Park in Pune\ntill finally the green signal was given and I was all set to visit the\nplace. As the arrangements were not absolutely “pucca” my dad decided\nto come along with me to Pune, which is what we did on the 3rd of\nOctober, soon after he returned from Chennai.",
        "We left Goa by bus and arrived at Pune early the next morning. Two of\nmy parents’ very good friends, Sujit and Vidya Patwardhan, live in\nPune. Our entire family, dad, mum, my two brothers and I, had holidayed\nat their place a year earlier. That was when I had my first glimpse of\nthe Pune Snake Park and the idea of my one year sabbatical took root.\n(Later, I was surprised to learn from Bany, their daughter, who I\nbecame good friends with, that her elder sister Lara and her friend had\ntaken a sabbatical several years ago on completing school and they had\ntoured the countryside looking at alternative methods of education.) So\nit was to the Patwardhan residence at Ganeshkhind Road that we first\nwent and after a wash and a brief rest we set off for the Park.",
        "The Director Mr Khaire was not in, but the Assistant Director Mr Rajan\nShirke was aware of my visit and assured my father that once Mr Khaire\narrived he would make arrangements for my food and stay. Until then I\ncould spend all day at the Park but would have to go back to Sujit’s\nhouse for the night. My father had no option but to leave it that way\nfor Mr Khaire was expected to return only after three days. Dad then\nleft me at the Park and proceeded to Mumbai. For the first few days\ntherefore I journeyed back and forth from Sujit’s house.",
        "Sujit’s home is at Ganeshkhind while the snake park is at Katraj, a\ngood 20 kms away. I remember how I got lost on the first day. My Dad\nhad shown me the bus stand in the morning and given me the bus number.\nIn the evening, one of the staff dropped me off at the bus stand where\nI waited and waited for the bus, which never arrived. I asked the\npeople around but their answers were either “it will come” or “the\nfrequency of that bus may be low”.",
        "Soon it started raining and since that bus-stand had no shelter in\nsight I had to stand in the rain and get wet. While I tried as much as\npossible to take shelter under the note book I carried, I was surprised\nto see a number of children, who didn’t seem to mind the rain, walking\ncoolly past me as if there were no rain at all! By seven in the\nevening, I was soaked to the skin. My feet were numb and it was getting\ndark. My first day at the snake park and what an experience!",
        "Anyway, I crossed the road and walked to a telephone booth. While I was\nphoning Sujit the electricity went off. Sujit kept trying to explain to\nme how to come home by another route. I took out my half wet note book\nand scribbled “Deccan Gymkhana” and “Simbla Office”. I managed to get a\nbus to Deccan Gymkhana (there are several buses which take you there)\nand from Simbla office I took a rickshaw and after going round in\ncircles for sometime, I managed to find Sujit’s house. How I wished I\nhad my trusty bicycle instead of having to depend on buses and\nrickshaws!",
        "During the first two days at the park I only scribbled notes and\nwatched the workers. I tried to make friends with the workers and as a\nresult I was allowed to handle one trinket snake. On the third day Mr\nKhaire arrived and immediately made arrangements for me to stay at the\nPark in spite of the Park not having accommodation facilities. Several\nstudents came there now and then to work for short stretches of time\nbut they all had their residences in Pune and went home in the\nevenings.",
        "Mr. Khaire is very popular among the workers and is affectionately\ncalled “Anna” (\"big brother” in Marathi) by one and all. He always\nwears a glove and long sleeved shirt as he lost his left hand to a\nRussell’s viper bite several years ago. Still, his love for the reptile\nworld and his enthusiasm for snakes has not diminished one bit.",
        "The Snake Park is quite large and has several snake pits housing\nvarious types of reptiles. In the centre is the administrative building\nwhich is a one storey cottage having on the ground floor a small office\nwhich doubles up as reception area, a room which holds the display\nexhibits like the king cobra, python etc., a store room and a toilet.\nOn the first floor is a large room with two beds. It is here that I\nbegan to stay, with the watchman as company for the night. Anna\ninstalled a small T.V. in the room and also had a phone extension made\nto my room. He told me that I was welcome to come over to his place\nanytime, to eat or even to stay. However, I preferred being at the\npark.",
        "In addition to Anna and Shirke there were about 8 to 10 staff at the\npark. Some of those I got to know very well included Mahesh, Milind,\nBhushan and Baba, the watchman. Many of the boys were studying at night\nschool and working here during the day. On Sundays and holidays there\nwould sometimes be extra students to lend a hand. All of them lived in\nPune and would go home for the night. However now and again some of\nthem would stay the night with me and we would watch T.V. or they would\ntell me tales. I also wrote my daily diary every evening after dinner,\nand sometimes read a bit.",
        "My work at the park was to help the workers with their jobs for that\nwas the only way for me to learn about snakes. So everyday I would\nclean the starback tortoise pit, the turkey pit, the chicken pits and\nlater on the ratsnake pit, the chequered keel back pit and the monitor\nlizard pit. I also assisted with feeding the snakes, which is usually\ndone once a week. Most of the snakes are fed small rats-the white mice\ncome from the laboratory-and frogs while the python gets a chicken\nevery week.",
        "I was also taught the proper way of holding and handling snakes. On\nthe third day, I was bitten by a wolf snake. Now you must understand\nthat this is a non-poisonous snake and it was deliberately allowed to\nbite me for my experience and to enable me to get over the irrational\nfear of snake bites that all of us have acquired as a result of\ngrandmother’s tales being dinned into us from childhood. In my case\neven though I liked snakes, still, Anna explained, there will be a\nsubconscious residual fear! This bite was not particularly painful and\ntreatment was like any other wound one might receive.",
        "During my stay at the snake park I was bitten on several occasions by a\nvariety of non-poisonous (but hot-tempered) snakes and when I left\nafter 3 weeks I had at least about 15-20 bites on my arms. Some of the\nbites were quite painful and one was so bad that my wrist had swelled\nup and I couldn’t wear my watch for quite sometime. However when you\nremember that the snake gets damaged much more than you-it loses quite\na few of its teeth in the bite-then you don’t feel too bad. At any rate\nthere was no question of using anti-venom as the snakes were all\nnon-poisonous. And I learnt to think of the bites as injuries and\nwounds rather than the much feared `snake-bite’.",
        "Besides snakes, the Park also has a number of other animals. Some had\nbeen rescued, others found injured and brought to the Park for rest and\nrecuperation. At the time of my stay at the Park it housed a wild boar,\na civet-cat, a leopard, a Shikra bird, a jackal, three mongooses and\nseveral owls and eagles with broken wings. The eagles and owls were in\ncages with the top end kept open.",
        "Once they were able to fly again they could fly out if they wished.\nThere were also many types of exotic fowls, guinea pigs, white mice,\nrabbits, monkeys and a pair of turkeys. And of course there were Ganges\nsoft shell turtles, starback tortoises and melanac turtles. All these\nanimals had to be fed daily and their cages cleaned regularly.",
        "The snake park has a system through which people in Pune city can call\nup the park if they sight a snake. Someone from the park will then go\nto the site with the caller, after taking directions from him/her, and\ntry to get the snake. This ensures that people do not unnecessarily\nkill snakes. It was on two such occasions that I went with the boys on\n\"calls” and returned without a snake. You see when the distance that\nthe rescue team has to travel is long, the snake may not necessarily\nremain in the same spot till it gets there.",
        "The snake park has a lot of visitors daily and people are always\nlooking for someone knowledgeable to answer questions. I used to feel\nquite proud to do this and would gladly answer all the queries like,\n\"What is the name of the snake?” “What does it eat?” “Which is the male\nand the female?” and so on. At other times I would be pestering the\nstaff to answer more complicated and detailed questions about the\nhabits of snakes. Workers are a mine of information and all of it is\nknowledge gained from practical experience.",
        "Some nights we went frog catching. We used to go after dinner on\nscooters to a river about 10 kms away. The method was simple. One\nperson shone a torch on the wet banks of the riverbed, blinding the\nvision of the frog, which would stop dead in its tracks, while another\nnabbed it with his bare hands from behind. (Frogs must be taken alive\nor else the snakes won’t eat them.) It was easy to catch the frogs as\nthey remain quite still for the few seconds it takes to catch them, the\ndifficult part being only to ensure that once caught they do not slip\nout of your grasp, for frogs are quite wet and slippery. After two to\nthree hours we would return with 25 to 30 frogs in our sack.",
        "I used to have my food at a small shack where some poor people cooked\nmeals mainly for the Snake Park staff. One of the popular items was\nsomething called `shample’ which was made of vegetables and had lots of\noil floating over it. This was served with bread and it was deep red in\ncolour and very spicy. After a couple of days of eating this delicious\nfood, I had a very bad stomach and I had to go to the toilet seven\ntimes that day. That was the end of shample. I decided to stick to dal\nand chappaties, and cheap creamrolls.",
        "The bathroom of the snake park looked very dirty and I usually avoided\nhaving a bath. I would wet my long hair and pretend that I had had a\nbath. When the Snake Park staff found out about this they decided to\ngive me a bath. One day they caught me and stripped me of all my\nclothes, then they dragged me to the bathroom and, using detergent and\na little bit of Harpic, they scrubbed me with the toilet brush.",
        "Somehow these chaps also came to know that I was afraid of the dark and\nall night sounds. So they kept telling me ghost stories which despite\nmy fears I liked to hear. Finally, on the last night I even met this\n\"real” ghost. It happened this way. Three of us, together with the\nwatchman were watching TV when Bhushan, one of the boys said he had to\ngo on a “call”. Shortly thereafter the lights went off and a sound like\na cat mewing was heard. Baba, the watchman didn’t seem to care but the\nother boy Popea and I were terrified. Next a light appeared at the\nwindow and the door started banging. A voice (in Marathi) thundered,\n\"close the window”. All sorts of strange things kept happening one\nafter another. A skull with bones was floating in the air outside the\nwindow and when we went out, cautiously, to see who was there we found\nno one. Returning to the room we found my bedding thrown around and my\nclothes and the whole room in a mess. The door frame shook, the windows\nrattled and I held on tight to the watchman’s hand. I remembered being\ntold that if one makes the sign of the cross the “ghost” will\ndisappear, and so I did that, but it didn’t work. This ghost apparently\ndid not know the rules. Then suddenly we received a phone call from\nBhushan saying that he was on his way back, and strangely, with\nBhushan’s return, the ghost had done the disappearing act. Nothing more\nwas heard from the ghost after that. The next day when I told Anna and\nthe others about this night-time visitor they all had a good laugh.",
        "During my stay at the park I learnt how to handle almost all the\nnon-poisonous snakes except the pythons. I also learnt how to handle\nmonitor lizards, catch geckos and eat earthworms. Eating earthworms was\nnot part of my diet or training, but once I saw Mr Shirke toss one into\nhis mouth after being challenged to do so by one of the boys. I thought\nof trying this out and though I felt nauseated the first time I took a\nbite. I was okay the second time, for earthworms taste crunchy, like\nraw cucumber, not slimy and wet as they look.",
        "On my last day at the Park, I was allowed to handle a cobra. I held a\nstick under the neck of the cobra and then lifted it by its tail. I did\nthis about 2-3 times after which the cobra was put back in its box. I\nwas so excited and happy. It was a perfect ending to my stay at the\nSnake Park.",
        "As I write this I think about my other previous experiences with\nsnakes. Like the story my mum tells about the time when I was only a\nfew months old, sleeping one afternoon in my cradle at our home in\nValpoi. She had heard a soft thud and to her utter horror she saw a\nthin bluish green snake which had obviously dropped from the roof\nmaking loops all over and around the cradle. Snakes are not unusual in\nthe countryside and RUSTIC Farm was no exception. Mum says she was\nterrified but dared not make a sound for I was sleeping soundly and the\ncradle was covered with a mosquito net, outside of which the snake\nleapt around. It was less than a minute before it bounded onto the\nchairs and was out of the window and she rushed to reassure herself\nthat I was safe which I very much was. From her description I know now\nthat it was a green whip snake, a very delicate and absolutely harmless\nsnake.",
        "Another time as a toddler, Mum says, I was playing with some old\ncartons and boxes at the farm when out leapt a snake from one of them.\nTo my parents’ astonishment, instead of crying out in fear as one might\nexpect a child to do, I promptly went on my hands and knees crawling\ntowards it as fast as I could, reaching out and trying to catch it.",
        "In fact, as mum tells it, I seem to have deliberately gone out of my\nway to befriend snakes as a child. I would be afraid of dogs, for, as I\nwould say, they had teeth and could bite, but snakes didn’t appear to\nhave any and for that reason perhaps remained my best friends.",
        "Field Work Notes:\nSnakes",
        "There are around 2500 species of snakes in the world. Of these, only\nabout 15% are poisonous. The maximum number of species of poisonous\nsnakes is found in Australia (90% of the snakes are poisonous).",
        "238 species of snakes are found in India. Of these, 72 are poisonous.\nBut only few can cause serious or fatal bites. For example, Pit Vipers\nare poisonous but rarely prove fatal to human beings. The poisonous Big\nFour are (1) the Cobra, (2) the Krait, (3) the Russel’s Viper, and (4)\nthe Saw-Scaled Viper. Of these the most poisonous is the common Krait.\nIts venom is about four times more toxic than that of the Cobra.",
        "All sea-snakes are poisonous. The most poisonous snakes in the world\ninclude some sea-snakes which have venom 5 times more toxic than the\nCobra. But sea-snakes will bite only when severely provoked and are\nnever known to attack swimmers in water.",
        "Snakes are cold-blooded; their eyesight is very poorly developed and\nthey have no eyelids. They are deaf and can only respond to vibrations.\nThey taste, feel and smell with their forked tongue. These senses are\nvery well developed and enable them to differentiate between living and\ndead creatures, prey or enemy.",
        "Some poisonous snakes inject venom into their prey, release the prey\nand then track it down with their tongue after the venom has done its\njob of killing it. The venom contains digestive enzymes that start\ndigesting the prey from the inside.",
        "Snakes grow rapidly till they mature and then continue to grow very\nslowly till their death. As they grow, they outgrow their skin so they\nmoult the old one after a new skin has formed under it. The snake\nsplits the old skin at the nose and literally crawls out of the old\nskin. During moulting, the snake stops eating but becomes aggressive.",
        "A bite from a poisonous snake affects either the nervous system\n(neurotoxic) or the blood vessels (hemotoxic) of human beings. The only\ncure against snake bite is snake anti-venom. It is made by injecting\nvery small doses of raw venom (about one-tenth of the fatal dose) into\na horse and then gradually increasing the dose, making the horse immune\nto snake venom. The blood of the horse is then drawn, frozen and\nprocessed after separating the antibodies and crystallized into a\npowder. This is anti-venom as we know it.",
        "When a snake bite occurs, the following first aid measures should be\ntaken. Panic should be avoided and the patient should be kept warm and\nreassured. The wound should be checked to see if it is a poisonous or\nnon poisonous bite. A poisonous bite will have two big fang marks, a\nnon poisonous bite will have many teeth marks.",
        "If the bite is poisonous, the patient should first be immobilized. No\nalcohol, tea, coffee or other stimulants, nor even painkillers should\nbe given.",
        "The wound should not be washed or cut or the poison swabbed out as this\ncould cause infection and loss of blood. A tight tourniquet can be tied\na little above the wound, such that one finger should be able to pass\nunder the tourniquet. The patient should be transported as quickly as\npossible to the nearest hospital. The tourniquet should be left in\nplace until antivenom is given. But it should be released for 10\nseconds every 90 seconds and should not be used for more than six\nhours. At the hospital antivenom will be given which rapidly subdues\nthe effects of the venom.",
        "To avoid snakes, the following precautions must be taken. Rubbish\naround the house should be cleared. Rat holes should be filled and rats\nshould be prevented from breeding in and around the house. Long tree\nbranches touching the houses and creepers trailing the porches and\nwindow panes should be cut. Good boots should be used while walking\nthrough forested area. Avoid stepping over any obstacle when the other\nside is not visible and use a torch while moving outside the house at\nnight.",
        "My stay at the Pune Snake Park was to be for about three weeks but I\nwas enjoying the experience so much that I was reluctant to return\nhome. To my good fortune the family decided to spend the Diwali\nvacation holidaying in Rajasthan and since it was necessary to travel\nto Mumbai to catch the onward train north, I persuaded my parents that\nI would come to Mumbai directly from Pune where I would meet them at my\ngrandparents’ house in Girgaum. So I got myself a few extra days at the\nPark and another experience of finding my way around, this time in the\nbig city of Mumbai.",
        "Sujit bought me a bus ticket to Mumbai and dropped me off at the bus\nstation as well. I had earlier received elaborate instructions on the\nphone from my dad on how I was to get to Girgaum once I got off the bus\nat Dadar and backup information from my nervous Mum on what I should do\nin case I got lost. I later learnt that my uncle and family were also\nput on alert to receive a call from their nephew in distress, which did\nnot happen for I was determined to find my way on my own, and I\nsucceeded in doing so.",
        "The bus left Pune at around 10 a.m. and arrived in Mumbai a little\nafter 2 p.m. I took a taxi, gave the driver the address and watched\ncarefully as the taxi sped away down unfamiliar streets. I could barely\nrecognise the place where the driver dropped me off but I asked around\nand after wandering about for around 20 minutes, found myself suddenly\nat the doorstep of the familiar 47/C Khotachiwadi, my paternal\ngrandparents’ house. My aunt and uncle were expecting me and so were my\nfavourite cousins, Lucano and Ricardo. An hour later came my parents’\nanxious call from Goa to find out if I had reached safely. By then I\nwas already in my shorts watching a movie on TV with my cousins.",
        "The next few weeks were strictly not part of my sabbatical programme\nfor it was a holiday along with my family, with snakes and frogs and\nfish left far behind. Our holiday included a brief visit to Ahmedabad\nwhere we stayed with Korah and Sue Mathen. I had met Korah and his\ndaughter Nidhi a few months earlier at the organic farmers’ meeting in\nWynad. On knowing that there was a snake park in Ahmedabad we simply\nhad to visit the place, just to satisfy my curiosity. At the park, we\nfound pythons, Russel’s vipers, kraits, chequered keelbacks, boas,\nratsnakes and a king cobra, all in glass cages. The park also had\nstarback tortoises, monitor lizards, ducks and geese of various kinds,\nmonkeys and other small animals. There was also a small aquarium, kept\nvery poorly. I don’t know whether the whole setup was run down because\nof lack of funds or lack of interest.",
        "From Ahmedabad we went by train to Jaipur where we spent the next eight\ndays at the home of Srilata and Mahendra Chowdhury. Although our base\nwas Jaipur we visited and stayed two nights at a real fort, on the\noutskirts of Jaipur. It was my first visit to a fort and it was quite\nan experience living high up in the residential part of the fort with\nits cool rooms, some large, others tiny, some corridors so narrow and\nso low one had to bend one’s head to walk through. The time of our\nvisit coincided with the famous solar eclipse which was the talk of the\ntown but I was disappointed with the eclipse as it darkened only\nbriefly before returning to normal again. My friends told me later that\nthe TV experience was far more wonderful.",
        "In Jaipur we went sightseeing almost everyday, visiting forts, palaces\nand shopping bazaars, and had delicious kulfi and lassi in mud pots,\nand mouth-watering chicken tandoori. We drove down to Udaipur, where we\nwent boating on the famous lake, saw some more palaces and then to\nSrilata and Mahendra’s second home in Ghantali where we swam in the\nriver behind the house and fished with the village boys.",
        "The vacation ended with a 3 hour bus journey to Ratlam station, from\nwhere my brothers and I returned to Mumbai with my mum while my dad\nwent on to Delhi. This time we stayed at my maternal grandparents’\nplace in Mahim. My grandfather, a sprightly 86 year old and a very\nactive gentleman, was there to greet us. It happened to be his birthday\nand he decided to take us all out to dinner to a Chinese restaurant not\nvery far away from the house. I recall we were all dressed and ready to\ngo when Mum asked Grandpapa how we were going to the restaurant. To\nwhich he said: “You and the boys take a taxi, but I will walk. I prefer\nto walk.” I was quite astonished. Of course, we all decided instead to\nwalk to the restaurant, with Grandpapa briskly leading the way, and had\nan enjoyable birthday dinner.",
        "My mum and my two younger brothers, Sameer and Milind returned to Goa\nsoon thereafter, but I stayed on with Grandpapa in Mumbai for a few\nmore days, since I was to proceed from there directly to Chennai where\nI would spend the next two and a half months in the pleasant company of\nspiders, earthworms and my all-time favourites, crocodiles and snakes.",
        "On the 6th of November, I was put on the Chennai Express, which was to\nleave Dadar Railway station at 7 p.m., by my Uncle Alan who is very\nknowledgeable about trains since he has worked in the railways all his\nworking life. My mum had requested him to check my departure from\nMumbai since Dadar railway station is a crowded and busy place and I\ntoo was not confident of finding my way around. Earlier Grandpapa had\nbrought me to the railway station by cab after making me double-check\nthat I had my ticket, sufficient cash, little tidbits to eat and my\nwater bottle filled for the long journey ahead.",
        "I was to spend one night and the whole of the next day in the train for\nit was due to arrive in Chennai at about 8.30 p.m. on the 7th. Having\ntravelled on a couple of journeys by train during the past few months I\nwas quite relaxed on this one although I continued to be watchful and\ncareful of my things throughout.",
        "The train journey from Mumbai was entirely uneventful. I had a window\nseat and slept the night on the lower berth. Around me was a family of\nmigrant workers who spoke neither Hindi nor English and who were quite\nbusy doing their own things. I did not speak with them nor with anyone\nelse on the journey but contented myself with watching the countryside\nwe passed through and the hustle and bustle at each station, and when I\nwas bored I just went to sleep. I had about Rs.500 with me in cash and\nsome of this was carefully tucked away in different pockets of my\njeans, the balance in various compartments of the haversack. When I\nslept the haversack was my pillow. I also carried a water bottle, some\nsnacks and some fruit which was all I ate during the journey.",
        "The train was delayed by 3 hours and it was well past 11.30 p.m. when\nit arrived at Chennai Central railway station. I was to be met at the\nstation by my parents’ long-time friend K. Manoharan. Uncle Mano and\nAunty Sagu had willingly agreed to look after me during my stay in\nChennai, even though both of them were not keeping good health. Not\nknowing where exactly Uncle Mano would be waiting I walked towards the\nentrance keeping a careful lookout for him. Yet, I failed to recognise\nhim when I saw him for his hair was whiter than when I had seen him\nlast. He recognised me, however, from the bright yellow haversack that\nI carried. He took me home in a rickshaw. I had some food there and\nwent straight off to sleep. Uncle Mano suggested that I relax the next\nday, which I did, watching T.V., looking at photo albums and generally\nchatting with them about my sabbatical so far and about my plans in\nChennai.",
        "Early the following morning Uncle Mano and I set off for New College\nwhere Dr Sultan Ismail’s Earthworm Institute is located and where I\nwould spend the next fortnight studying earthworms and vermiculture.\nActually I had a choice of studying at Dr Bhawalkar’s centre in Pune or\nDr Ismail’s institute in Chennai. But I chose Chennai because I had\nheard Dr Ismail speak at the organic farmers’ convention in Kottayam\nand had liked his talk very much. Another reason of course was that I\nwas dying to get to the Crocodile Bank in Mamallapuram and being in\nChennai which was close to the Croc Bank was infinitely better than\nbeing far away in Pune where Dr Bhawalkar works.",
        "Although Uncle Mano, being a heart patient, does not usually travel by\nbus, he deliberately took me by bus that morning so that I could get to\nknow the route to New College. On the way he pointed out to me various\nlandmarks which would help me know my way around, and gave me general\nbits of advice on how to travel in the city. I had to learn well and\nquickly, for language would be the main problem for me in this city\nwhere I spoke no Tamil.",
        "At the College we met Dr Ismail who took us through the college campus\ndown to the fields where the vermi-pits were and we saw the biogas\nplant, the garbage collection pits, the culture crates and the organic\ncompost now ready for use. I was quite eager to begin and happy when\n\"Sir” as everyone calls him, suggested I start work from the next day\nitself.",
        "Every day, except Sundays, for the next 15 days I followed the same\nroutine which was: wake up at 6 a.m or so, eat a hot breakfast of\nidlis, sambar, dosas, vadas or whatever was cooked for breakfast, carry\na hot packed lunch which Aunty Sagu prepared for me and catch a bus by\n7 a.m. from Ashok Pillar to Panagal where I had to change buses and get\non one going to New College. Usually I would land up at the College by\n8.30 a.m. or so and would be at the College till about 3.30 or 4 p.m.,\nafter which the journey would be reversed. These timings helped me to\navoid the office rush both ways. My dad had suggested to Prof Ismail\nthat I be given practical experience and so my programme included a\nmixture of study from books, taking down notes, watching and helping\nthe others and finally making my own vermi-pits.",
        "During the first two days I read up as much as I could about earthworms\nand the world they inhabit from books which were recommended to me by\nDr Ismail. Later I started to observe the different types of\nearthworms, their movements, colour and other characteristics. I also\nlearnt a lot about different types of soils, their textures and nature,\nand was taught how to take soil samples using the tulgren funnel.",
        "There were about 8 to 10 students doing different kinds of research\nunder Dr Ismail and all of us worked in a large room which was formerly\nthe main library. Each one had a separate desk to work and when I came\nI was also given my own desk and chair. The big hall also had a mini\nlibrary on earthworm related books at one end and it was a simple\nmatter therefore to find the books I needed to read.",
        "The main vermi-beds, compost pits and so on were on the ground floor\nbut some of the vermi-beds which were in crates were stacked in the\nnarrow corridor outside the study hall, where we also gathered to eat\nour lunch in the afternoons. Usually any one of the students would\nbriefly guide me in the work that I was assigned for the day after\nwhich I would manage on my own.",
        "During my fortnight stay at the Institute I learnt a lot about\nearthworm environments, including determination of porosity of soil,\nmoisture content and texture. I also observed the other organisms\npresent in the soil and took photos of microarthropods with the help of\na compound microscope. At the end of the course, I practically prepared\na vermi-bed and also ate a few earthworms and cockroaches for\nexperience!",
        "My stay in Chennai was not without its share of adventure. I recall\nthat on my second day, I had entered a bus and rushed for an empty\nseat. I was completely unaware of the procedure, that while in Goa the\nticket collector comes to you and sells you the ticket in the bus, in\nChennai one has to go to the conductor (who is seated at the end of the\nbus) and buy the ticket. So while I waited for the conductor to come on\nhis rounds two inspectors came up to me and caught me for not buying\nthe ticket. One of them started shouting at me in a forceful stream of\nTamil. After much action and hand waving, I explained that I did not\nknow Tamil, that I was from Goa and it was the first time I was\ntravelling in a bus in Chennai. He fined me Rs.25! Fortunately, I had\nenough money on me and paid the fine but when I got down from the bus,\nI found that my empty purse had also been pick-pocketed!",
        "Another time I was on the last step of a bus which I thought would be\nquite okay for I had seen many people travelling while hanging at the\ndoors of crowded buses. However, as this bus started gathering speed I\nfound it very difficult to hold on because the weight of so many people\nbegan to press against me and it felt like I was literally holding\neveryone in with my outstretched arms as I hung practically out of the\ndoor. I resolved never to travel on the footboard, if I could help it,\nagain.",
        "I also got lost several times. But I would never phone for help with\ndirections but would struggle away, walking this side or that, asking\npassers-by till I reached familiar landmarks which would get me home.\nOften I found that I had alighted from the bus a few stops before or\nafter my destination. On one such occasion the next stop was so far\naway that I jumped out of the bus while it slowed down at a traffic\nlight and then spent nearly 30 minutes walking back!",
        "Although Uncle Mano and Aunty Sagu had welcomed me very warmly. Looking\nback, I think I must have given them quite a headache during my stay at\ntheir house because of my rather careless and casual ways and the\nlaid-back lifestyle I had acquired and was thoroughly enjoying. Uncle\nMano would constantly be shouting at me for not having a bath regularly\nor for staying in the bathroom forever when I decided to have a bath or\nfor wearing soiled clothes again instead of washing them.",
        "Aunty Sagu cooks well and I enjoyed her food but both she and Uncle\nMano would notice that I ate much more when there was chicken or fish\nfor dinner rather than vegetarian food and I would get a lecture again\nfor my poor appetite for simple food. I was also quite a sloppy fellow\nand would slouch around on the sofas after coming back from the\ncollege, channel surfing as I watched TV, which must have been quite\nexasperating for both of them. Anyway, they took very good care of me,\nnot only in terms of feeding me but also going out of their way to make\narrangements for me to study at the Earthworm Institute, the spider\ncentre and later at the Crocodile Bank and I am most grateful for that.\nI hope when they read this book they will forgive me for all the\ntrouble I must have caused them.",

        "10th November: Sir gave me a book on earthworms to read, then Jagan\ntook me down to the field. There I was able to observe many organisms\nother than earthworms. We took a soil sample from one place and then\nwent back to the lab where we put the soil sample into the tulgren\nfunnel. I then went and brought three more samples from the vermi-tech\npit. We then put these also into three other tulgren funnels. By then\nit was lunch time and we all ate together. After lunch I weighed the\nsoil samples and got to see the organisms that were in the beaker under\nthe tulgren funnel. At 3.30 p.m I left for home.",
        "11th November: In the morning, I was given two types of earthworms i.e.\nLampito mauritii and Perionyx excavatus and told to observe them. I\nspent the whole morning doing this. After lunch, I wrote down the\nobservations that I had made. In the evening we went out to the College\nplayground and also to the area near the College Boarding to make some\nobservations. We dug two pits of 25 cm x 25 cm x 25 cm each at the\nplayground and one, of the same size, at the Boarding. We made many\nobservations which included the number and species of earthworms we\nfound and whether they were clitellates or not. We also made\nobservations regarding soil, atmospheric temperature and relative\nhumidity and took soil samples to measure the moisture content.",
        "12th November: Left for New College as usual. I was told that Sir did\nnot come today as he had a high viral fever. Yesterday a research\nscholar had expired and so there was a condolence meeting today. After\nthat everybody left as it was declared a holiday. I arrived home at\nabout 10.30 a.m. I had a bath and then some food. I then watched a bit\nof TV and wrote my diary. In the night Uncle Mano and Aunty Sagu had\ninvited some guests and had cooked chicken curry which I enjoyed very\nmuch.",
        "14th November: Sir did not arrive today either. With the help of Jagan\nI used the Infrared Moisture Balance to find out the moisture content\nof the soil samples which we had taken on Saturday. After we finished\none sample, the voltage started fluctuating so we used the tulgren\nfunnel instead. Then Jagan sent me to get soil samples from the field\nand from the area near the Boarding. We put the soil samples in the\ntulgren funnel and observed the arthropods that fell into the beaker\nunder a compound microscope. We also observed some preserved specimens\nof microarthropods.",
        "15th November: Pounded 100 gms of soil sample and then sieved each soil\nsample through 5 sieves. Then weighed the soil in each sieve and noted\nthis down.",

        "18th November: Sir arrived this morning. Read some books in the library\nfor sometime. Then did a bit of soil sieving and then did burning of\nsoil in a bunsen burner. In the afternoon, I watched a very comic film\ncalled “Junior Shylock”.",
        "19th November: Started preparing my report in rough. In the evening I\nwent with Babu to buy a film roll for taking photographs for my report.",
        "20th November: Did burning of a second sample of soil. After that\nJagan, Sir and I photographed microarthropods with the help of the\ncompound microscope that has a camera attached to it. After lunch, I\nattended a seminar conducted by one of the students.",

        "Field Notes on Vermiculture:\nTurning Garbage into Gold",
        "Vermicompost and vermiwash are the two earthworm products that have\nbecome very popular nowadays. Ordinary organic garbage which consists\nof litter, such as, kitchen waste and dead plant material is used and\nconverted into manure with the help of earthworms.",
        "There are three kinds of earthworms. One, the epigeal or surface\nearthworm (Perionyx excavatus) which eats only organic litter which is\npresent on the top layer of the soil. Two, the anecic earthworms\n(Lampito mauritii) which are present in the upper layers of soil and\nfeed on waste and leaf litter. The third kind are present deep inside\nthe soil and are known as endogeic earthworms (Octochaetona\nthriretonis).",
        "The most suitable earthworms recommended for vermiculture are the\nepigeic and anecic earthworms. Perionyx excavatus is purplish red and\nrough. Near the two ends the Perionyx excavatus is almost black in\ncolour. It is smaller and thinner (approx. 10 cms long) and more active\ncompared to the Lampito mauritii. They also breed faster than Lampito\nmauritii. Lampito mauritii are greyish white in colour and shiny,\nthicker and longer (length-16 cms) compared to Perionyx excavatus.",
        "Earthworms prefer cool temperatures, moist soil, humidity, relatively\nless sunlight and neither too coarse nor too fine sand. These are the\nideal conditions that must be kept in mind when using them for\nvermiculture. Since earthworms breathe through the skin, they perish if\ntheir skin becomes dry or the quantity of mucus diminishes. Hence to\nkeep earthworms alive in the vermicompost containers, care should be\ntaken to ensure that the vermibed remains moist. Earthworms however do\nnot prefer waterlogged soils. In fact if earthworms are kept in water\nfor too long, the concentration of ammonia that is discharged through\ntheir excreta makes the water too toxic for the earthworms to survive.\nEarthworms also cannot tolerate salt or salt water even briefly.",
        "Earthworms are hermaphrodites. Depending on the species, their life\nspan is between six months to one year. Fully matured earthworms upon\nmating shed their clitellum (a small band like an overgrowth of skin)\nand produce cocoons which take about 14 days to incubate and hatch into\njuveniles. Maximum three juveniles are hatched from each cocoon. From\nthe juvenile to the clitellate stage i.e. the fully matured or\nreproductive stage it takes 15-18 days. Thus earthworms are able to\nmultiply several times in their life span which makes them ideally\nsuited to process even large quantities of garbage.",
        "A pit, a small plastic or wooden crate or, even a bucket, can be used\nfor vermicomposting organic matter. Although not necessary, two crates\ncan be used simultaneously; while one is being used for fresh garbage,\nthe garbage in the other can be allowed to decompose.",
        "First, 6-8 holes should be made (one at each corner and four in the\nmiddle of the crate). A pot or a bucket needs about 3-5 holes. The\ncrate or pit must first be filled with a one inch layer of pebbles or\nbroken bricks. Then, a half to one inch layer of sand should be spread.\nOver that, a five to six inch layer of soil should be spread. Then\nLampito mauritii and Perionyx excavatus earthworms should be\nintroduced. The soil must then be moistened with water. A little bit of\ncowdung (nitrogen) and some hay (carbon) should be spread on it, and\nthe contents of the pit left for 20-30 days. This is called a vermibed.\nThe cowdung and hay will allow the worms to multiply. With this, the\nvermicompost crate or pit will be ready for processing organic waste.",
        "All organic waste should be evenly spread out on the vermibed. As far\nas possible add garbage in small quantities regularly rather than\ndumping large quantities at one go. The earthworm begins processing the\ngarbage immediately. Water the container occasionally so that the\nvermibed remains moist. Once the container is full with organic waste,\nit should be covered with a little soil and allowed to decompose\nundisturbed. Only watering the pit should continue. After it has\ndecomposed fully (roughly 45 days) watering must be stopped for about 3\nto 5 days. This will force the earthworms to migrate down to the bottom\nof the container which will have some moisture as compared with the top\nsoil. Then the top layer of soil which is really the organic matter\nwhich has been converted into manure should be removed without\ndisturbing the vermibed. This organic manure can be used for plants.",
        "A drum, barrel or bucket can be used for making vermiwash. The drum or\nbucket should be placed on supports a little above the ground. A hole\nshould be made at the bottom of the container. A pipe should be pushed\nthrough the hole and a tap attached to the outer end.",
        "The bottom of the drum should be covered with a layer of gravel (about\n6-8 inches). Over it, a layer of sand (6-8 inches), and then a layer of\nsoil (6-8 inches) should be spread. The earthworms should then be\nintroduced and the soil moistened a little. Then a little bit of\ncowdung and hay should be mixed together and scattered over it. This\nshould be left for a few days.",
        "Whenever vermiwash is needed, water should be sprinkled with a shower\nor, gradually poured on top of it (5 litres of water for a 150 litres\ndrum). The water will pass through the earthworm burrows and the\norganically rich soil will become liquid manure and can be collected at\nthe bottom of the container. As the hay and cowdung is eaten up by the\nearthworms, this should gradually be replaced.",
        "In nature, litter is decomposed in a way similar to what happens in a\nvermicompost pit. Litter (consisting of leaf material, twigs, bark,\ndead wood, flowers, fruits and other plant and animal material) that\nfalls on the ground is constantly moistened by dew or rain.\nDecomposition then sets in with the help of microbes, fungi and\nmicroarthropods.",
        "Microarthropods are of two kinds-the detritivores that feed on the\nlitter attacked by the microbes and fungi and the predators that feed\non the detritivores. The litter that has not been decomposed, dead\nmicrobes and microarthropods, along with their excretions and\nsecretions, mix and form humus. This humus is in a complex form and\ntherefore not available to the plants for use. Here is where earthworms\ncome into the picture. The earthworms present in the soil feed on the\nhumus. The castings (wormicasts) excreted by these earthworms, as a\nresult, contain nutrients in a form that is readily available to the\nplants for their growth. The plants in turn, when they die or shed\nleaves, contribute to the litter which becomes food for microbes and\nfungi. Thus nature’s cycle is made whole and complete.",
        "Earthworms have proven that they are wonderful creatures for they can\ntruly turn garbage into gold.",
        "My stint with vermiculture over, I had another fortnight of study with\nDr K. Vijayalakshmi, whom my dad calls India’s `Spider Woman’. Dr\nVijayalakshmi has been doing research on rearing spiders as a\nbiological weapon for controlling cockroaches and her workplace is full\nof spiders of various types, all in bottles, and bred under her\nsupervision. An authority on spiders, she is also the author of a\nwell-known book on the subject.",
        "Actually I had been anxiously waiting for a phone call from my parents\nsaying that the decks were cleared for my Crocodile Bank visit. Instead\nDad had phoned to say that the final arrangements for my stay at Croc\nBank were still being finalised and that I could use the 10 days or so\nin between to learn what I could from Dr Vijayalakshmi about spiders,\nand the unusual use she intends to put them to. I had readily agreed.",
        "Dr K. Vijayalakshmi and her husband both work in an organisation called\nthe Centre for Indian Knowledge Systems (CIKS). CIKS is housed in a one\nstorey building and Dr Vijayalakshmi’s office is on the first floor.\nHere she studies various plants that are useful as pesticides and so\non. But I was not at all concerned with that aspect of her work.",
        "In the garage of the building was the Spider Room-a laboratory of sorts\nfilled with bottles of different spiders in various stages of growth.\nThere must have been over 500 transparent plastic bottles at the time I\nwas there, each one neatly labelled, and all sitting one next to the\nother with spiders in them. For air, each bottle had tiny pinholes in\nits lid. Feeding was done through another small hole in the lid: this\nhole was plugged with cotton. All these spiders and their activities\nincluding growth, moulting, mating and hatching of babies were\nmonitored by Dr Vijayalakshmi. She had an assistant called Selvan and\nhe followed her instructions, keeping the records and making the\nnotings in a log book.",
        "During the fortnight that I worked with Dr Vijayalakshmi, I simply\nslipped into this set-up, reading books about spiders that Dr\nVijayalakshmi gave me, then learning to identify different spiders and\nsimultaneously helping Selvan in all the tasks that were needed to\nmaintain the huge spider population housed in the garage.",
        "The spiders that Dr Vijayalakshmi deals with are called giant crab\nspiders. These spiders do not build webs. They feed only on\ncockroaches. The spiders were a little smaller than their prey i.e. the\ncockroaches. I used to separate the babies, feed them, check the\nmoultings and catch flies for feeding them. I read a lot of books here\nand sometimes caught the spiders in the garden in order to identify and\nstudy them.",
        "Spiders were not the only creatures housed in the garage. There were\nalso cockroaches bred in buckets with rolled cardboard in the centre\nand broken biscuit pieces thrown in the bucket. The cockroaches were\nfed once a week or so to the giant crab spiders.",
        "The smaller spiders used to get flies to eat and these were caught by\nus everyday from the garden. The flies have to be fed alive to the\nspiders, so we used transparent plastic bottles to trap the flies and\nonce caught we would carefully put them into the spider’s bottle.\nSometimes the spider would immediately catch the prey and eat it; at\nother times the fly would buzz around in the bottle for days till the\nspider was ready to eat it.",
        "Dr Vijayalakshmi also bred a particular species of fly in a small cage\nwith fine mesh with a small saucer of milk in the centre as a medium\nfor breeding.",
        "Baby spiders were also housed individually in bottles and these were\nfed fly larvae or the larvae which come when maida or rava begins to\nlose its freshness.",
        "The purpose of all these experiments was to find out which types of\nspiders were useful for using as pest control agents to deal with\ncockroaches. Information about spiders such as their growth, hardiness,\ntheir eating habits, reproduction etc. are important indicators of the\nspecies of spiders that can be kept in houses as predators for\ncockroaches.",
        "Other than the spider work I tried to learn Tamil from Selvan but he\nwas keen to learn English from me and so both of us failed in learning\na new language and ended up speaking a cocktail of TamEnglish instead.",

        "27th November: Watched how Selvan separated baby spiders from their\nmother, placing each baby in a separate container. There were about 110\nbabies. Then we fed about 200 older spider babies. Selvan showed me how\nto check their moulting.",

        "1st December: Madam came to the office today and showed me how to\ncollect spiders which were in the compound of the office. She also gave\nme some more material to read on spiders and told me to start preparing\nmy essay on spiders. After doing a little bit of feeding as usual, I\nwent out on my own and collected few species of spiders. Then Madam\nhelped me identify them and also some other species of spiders that\nthey had caught. Spent the afternoon catching flies to feed to some of\nthe older spiders.",
        "2nd December: Today I only did identifying of different species of\nspiders. I took some material home to read and so I left early; was so\nbusy looking at the books I was carrying, I didn’t notice the terminus\nwhere I was to get off and got over carried much further.

        "Field Work Notes:\nSpiders",
        "These days most of us use Baygon or some other synthetic poison to\ncontrol cockroaches and other pests. But what does this do? It only\nmakes cockroaches or pests immune or resistant to such poisons.\nMoreover, synthetic chemicals are very harmful and pollute the\nenvironment. How nice it would be if we had a biological method of\ncontrolling of pests. But that’s just what spiders are!",
        "A spider is not an insect. Insects are made up of a head, thorax and an\nabdomen. They have compound eyes and are six-legged. They usually grow\nwings in certain stages of their life and possess feelers or antennae.\nInsects produce eggs which hatch into young that are completely\ndifferent from their parents. The young ones usually grow through\nmetamorphosis.",
        "A spider on the other hand is an arthropod, made up of a cepolothorax\njoined to an abdomen. It does not grow wings at any stage of its life.\nIt is eight-legged, and in place of the normal insect antennae it has\npedipalps. A spider generally has eight simple eyes or it could have\nsix eyes e.g. a spitting spider. Depending on the species the eyesight\nmay be well or poorly developed. Some species, such as the cave\nspiders, are totally blind. Depending on the species a spider’s life\nspan ranges from a couple of months to more than a decade (e.g.\nmygalomorphs).",
        "Almost all spiders have their first pair of appendages later modified\ninto fangs with venom glands. But only a few have fangs that are large\nand strong enough to pierce human skin. Out of these, most cannot do\nany serious damage to human beings except for about four to five\nspecies which can be lethal.",
        "The Black Widow spider, for example, which is found in South America is\nthe most poisonous of all spiders. The female of the species, whose\npoison is strong enough to kill a human being, often kills and eats the\nmale after mating and is thus aptly named the Black Widow. This spider\nis shiny black in colour with a red hour glass mark on the ventricle\nside of the abdomen. Fortunately, there are no spiders in India which\ncan seriously harm human beings.",
        "There are about 30,000 species of spiders in the world. They have been\nfound upto a height of 23,000 feet up Mount Everest as well as\nunderwater.",
        "Almost all spiders are carnivorous. They can eat insects, small birds,\nmammals and reptiles, including poisonous snakes and other spiders,\nwhich they first subdue with their poison. They inject their prey with\na highly lethal venom and, having no teeth, suck out the liquid from\ninside their prey. Large spiders with longer and powerful jaws may eat\npart of or even the whole of their prey. Spiders can live without food\nfrom a few weeks upto three months, depending on species, size, and\nage. They obtain liquid from their food and thus do not need water.",
        "Many spiders spin webs to capture their prey. However spiders also have\nother means of capturing their prey. Some spiders spit a sticky web\nonto their prey. Others live in burrows with trapdoors. Whenever they\nfeel hungry they come out and catch an unsuspecting insect. One species\nattaches a sticky drop to one end of its silken thread and holds it\nwith its first three pairs of legs. When an insect passes by, the\nspider waves the thread at the insect and ropes it in, as it were.",
        "Some spiders sit on flowers and catch insects that come to collect\nnectar. Others spin a small web, hold it with their first few pairs of\nappendages and then throw it on insects passing below them. Still\nothers feed on other spiders only and are called pirate spiders. A few\nspiders live on the webs of other spiders: they are too small to be\neaten by their host. They eat the small prey that get caught in the\nweb, thus keeping it tidy.",
        "Spiders also have amazing defence mechanisms. Some spiders camouflage\nthemselves as a bird dropping. Others, as a dried yellow or black\nrotting leaf or twig. And yet others resemble ants which are often\nrejected by birds, reptiles and other insects. Some are even able to\nchange colour and shape, to some extent, to match their surroundings.\nSome species build zigzag white coloured threads in their webs which\nare visible to birds who avoid flying through the webs and damaging\nthem.",
        "The male spider is smaller than the female, and is thus liable to be\neaten by his mate. So, the male uses many tactics to prevent his being\ndevoured by his mate. In some cases the male drums or pulls at the\nstrings of the web in a special code to announce that he is not a prey\nor an enemy, but a sexual object.",
        "Some spiders offer their mate a gift such as a juicy fly, wrapped in\nsilk. But it may well be taken back after mating and offered to another\nfemale. Sometimes a male may even offer the female the empty husk of an\ninsect. Sometimes the male loosely binds the female with silk to\nimmobilize her before mating. Some species of male spiders may\npatiently wait near the web of a female spider for weeks until she has\ncaught a prey, and then mate with her while she is busy feeding on the\nprey. Sometimes, the male is so small compared to the female that the\nfemale is practically unaware of him while mating and this gives him\nprotection.",
        "Most spiders are solitary in nature. Each one builds its own separate\nweb. If one spider falls by mistake into another web, the bigger spider\nwill eat the smaller spider. However, there are some spiders called\nsocial spiders that live together in one web. Sometimes there may be\nhundreds or even thousands of adults and young ones living in one web.\nEven if a single prey is caught (such as a small fly), all the spiders\nwill share the meal.",
        "Spiders multiply very rapidly. After mating, an egg sac is constructed\nand the internally fertilized eggs laid inside the egg sac which is\ncarried by the female with her palps and fangs. Fertilization of eggs\nmay be internal or external depending on the species. Within 15 to 20\ndays, 80% of the eggs hatch. (The eggs hatch into young spiderlings.\nThe new born spiders are similar to their parents, only smaller. The\nspiderlings moult to mature.) After a gap of one week to ten days the\nnext batch of eggs is laid in a fresh egg sac, and fertilised with the\nhelp of stored sperm. The female can do this three to four times\nwithout mating with another male, although she will readily mate with a\nmale after the laying of every batch of eggs.",
        "Spiders have proven themselves to be one of the best biocontrollers of\ninsect pests. Very few of us realize that spiders were, are and will be\nlaying traps for insects even after man has finally disappeared from\nthe earth.",
        "How to Rear Spiders",
        "Spiders have cannibalistic tendencies, i.e. if two or more are kept in\none container, they will prey on each other. Hence from birth, they\nmust be separated into individual containers.",
        "Transparent plastic containers (size depending on the individual\nspecies) can be used to rear spiders. A few pin-sized holes should be\nmade in the lid of the container as aeration holes. One big hole should\nbe made for dropping prey inside. It should be blocked with a piece of\ncotton.",
        "Baby spiders will eat culture foods such as Thrypolium, drosophilia,\nfruit fly and house fly larvae. As they grow, they will eat house flies\nand later on cockroaches.",
        "Cleaning the prey remains and moults is a must. Two containers should\nbe used. Every week the used one should be washed with soap and water,\nand allowed to dry in the sun.",
        "The legs of the stands on which the spider containers are kept should\nbe placed in bowls of water or oil to avoid ants. The adults should be\nfed well before allowing them to mate. Spiders will tolerate moderate\nroom temperature.",
        "Culturing food",
        "1. Milk powder and a medium sized piece of cotton, mixed with water.\nEvery day, a teaspoon of milk powder should be added.",
        "2. Drosophilia larvae culturing: quarter cup of wheat flour and two\nmedium sized pieces of jaggery should be boiled in two cups of water.",
        "Housefly and drosophilia can be reared in a wooden or metal framed box,\ncovered with a fine mesh or netting. The above mixture should be put\ninto small bowls and introduced into the cage. Adult houseflies and\ndrosophilia should be captured and put inside the cage and left there\nto lay their eggs.",
        "3. Thrypodium larvae: adults are found in rava and maida. A special\nbucket should be kept with an aeration hole and the maida or rava in\nthe bucket, sprinkled with a little bit of water every day. A strainer\ncan be used to strain out the larvae wherever necessary.",
        "4. Cockroaches: need a bucket with many big aeration holes, covered\nwith a fine mesh. A few rolls of paper can be placed vertically inside\nthe box for the cockroaches to climb on.",
        "December was the most eagerly awaited month of my one year sabbatical.\nAll decks had finally been cleared for my long awaited trip to the\nCrocodile Bank at Mamallapuram. Nearly three months earlier my dad had\nwritten to Romulus Whitaker the legendary snakeman who now runs the\nCroc Bank asking whether I could spend some time there. There had been\nno reply largely because Rom travels quite a bit but also because, as I\ndiscovered, writing replies to letters is about the last thing these\nanimal-dedicated persons have time for.",
        "I was in fact beginning to feel quite frustrated thinking that my trip\nwould not work out when Srilata Swaminadhan (with whom we stayed in\nJaipur) told my father that her sister lived at Mamallapuram and would\nhelp out. Phone calls back and forth and finally it was all organised.\nI was overjoyed when my dad’s phone call came to Uncle Mano’s house\nsaying I could go.",
        "Babu, Uncle Mano’s nephew, reached me by bus to the Croc Bank on the\n9th of December and I spent one glorious month there, the nearest I got\nto living in the wild. Although I was supposed to return home for\nChristmas I begged to be let off and was in the seventh heaven when my\nparents agreed. In fact I enjoyed my stay so much, that in March, I\nreturned to the Croc Bank again (for a brief while), as that was the\nbreeding season for crocodiles.",
        "The Croc Bank is situated at Mamallapuram which is about 37 kms from\nChennai. It is a huge place with a beach just behind it.",
        "Croc Bank is home to thousands of crocodiles, all of them housed in\npits of varying sizes with sloping walls to enable water to collect at\nthe centre so that the crocs can sunbathe on the upper part of the\nslopes. Some of the huge crocodiles have individual pits but usually\nthe species is kept separately, male and female further separated from\neach other. A large enclosure divided into several sections houses the\nbaby crocs.",
        "In addition to crocodiles, snakes also have a significant position at\nCroc Bank for snakes were Director Romulus Whitaker’s first love, and\nhe is still known as the Snakeman, having founded Madras Snake Park\nseveral years ago. There is, in fact, a big snake pit at the Croc Bank,\nin which various kinds of snakes are kept. Here, snake venom is\nextracted from the snakes by the Irulas. There is a separate fee for\nvisitors for entering the snake area. While the poisonous snakes are\nkept in pots in a snake room, the King Cobras, of course, have special\nseparate rooms.",
        "Croc Bank also has enclosures and pits for various kinds of turtles and\nlarge aquariums with fish in them.",
        "At one end of the campus is the library, well stocked with books and\nmagazines on all these creatures. Adjacent to it are the residential\nquarters of researchers and guests (there were mainly foreigners at the\ntime I was there) who come to stay at Croc Bank from time to time. The\nresidential quarters are quite simple but comfortable. Each room has a\nbed, desk and table, and an attached bath and toilet. I occupied one of\nthese rooms during my stay here.",
        "The Irula families live in a separate area close to where the Snake\npits are located. The permanent staff which includes the Director,\nDeputy Directory and others have their own individual houses located in\nvarious places within the Croc Bank.",
        "During my stay I became good friends with many of the people at the\nCroc Bank including the six foot tall Director, Romulus Whitaker, whom\neveryone calls Rom; his wife, Zai Whitaker; their sons Samir and\nNikhil; Harry Andrews, the Deputy Director who hails from Kerala;\nRomaine, his wife and their son Tharak, Gerry the snake-catcher from\nBangalore and many others.",
        "My stay at Croc bank was exciting throughout and I learnt a lot. For\nthe first few days, I was given my first assignment i.e., treating a\n2-foot long turtle with infected skin. I used to apply ointment to its\nfeet and then put on some bandage. The next day, before repeating the\ntreatment, I had to feed the turtle with cabbage in water.",
        "From turtles, I moved to big lizards i.e. monitor lizards and Green\nIguanas. The Green Iguana I handled was quite big-about the size of an\naverage dachshund. His tail measured two to three times the length of\nhis body if not more. From head to tail, he must have been about two\nand a half metres long. But he had been in captivity for so long that\nhe was very friendly, though he had sharp claws and a spiny back and\nhead. Sometimes, when I used to guide special guests around, I would\ntake him out so that they could have a feel of his sandpapery skin. I\nwas surprised when Harry, the deputy director, told me the Iguana was\nas old as I was.",
        "Sometimes, I also handled monitor lizards. They were very strong, had\nsharp claws and a very bad bite. Every time I jumped into the pit to\nhandle them they would rush into the water. I soon learned to be quick\nenough, and would get them before they could reach the water. Once they\nwere cornered they would whip their tails about and inflate their\nnecks, hissing dangerously. Of course, you had a few of them running up\ntrees and then you couldn’t do anything about it. I soon discovered\nthat though it looked scarier, it was easier to catch them in the\nwater.",
        "The croc bank is filled with pits. Each of these pits is an enclosure\nvarying in size, depending on the size and type of reptile, and the\nnumber of them in it. Every pit has a pond of sorts filled with water\nfor the reptiles to swim in or to drink. Most of the crocodile pits\nwere bare, but the monitor lizard pits were usually filled with trees\nwhich they could climb to the highest branches. The branch ends were\nkept within the range of the pits so that the monitor lizards did not\nget out by trying to climb other trees or jumping out from the high\nbranches.",
        "The ponds of the monitor lizards were almost waist deep with dark murky\nwater and you had to feel around until you touched the head, leg or\nbody of the monitor (they are less likely to bite in water). Then I\nwould feel around till I got the tail, slowly lift it to the surface\nand grab the neck under the water. Their necks were so huge that I\ncould hardly get my fingers round them. On land, catching them by\ngrabbing the tail was much faster, but one had to avoid the biting head\nby quickly grabbing the neck.",
        "Once, when the Croc Bank staff wanted to get some monitors down from\nthe trees, they just took a long stick and pushed them over from the\nheight of almost a two storey building. They fell on the ground but\nsuffered no damage and just continued running around. I recall the day\nGerry challenged Nikhil “the bodybuilder” to pull a monitor lizard that\nwas half out of a burrow. At first he thought the monitor’s tail would\nbreak but though he tugged with all his might his rippling muscles\ncouldn’t move an inch of the monitor.",
        "In the mornings, I helped the workers clean the croc pits, a task which\nI thoroughly enjoyed. We would jump into the pits with big sticks and\nchase all the crocs into the water. Then we would clean out the croc\nshit and the left overs of their food which included a lot of bones.\nThis exercise was usually done with a male worker first chasing the\ncrocs into the water. Then the remaining 3 to 4 women would help with\nbrooms, baskets and spades. Occasionally, we would have a crocodile\nwanting us to get out of his pit instead. No matter how hard you hit\nhim on his nose he would chase you around until he would finally give\nin, so to speak, and dash into the water with a big splash or\nsometimes, glide gracefully to where he could join his friends who\nsometimes numbered a thousand! (The Croc Bank had around seven thousand\ncrocs at the time I was there.)",
        "I also had occasion to participate a few times in the operations\ninvolved in shifting crocodiles from one location to another. That was\nquite an adventure in itself!",
        "One day Rom and Harry decided to shift the largest male Gharial in the\nCroc Bank from one pit to another as it had broken its upper jaw in a\nfight with another male during the previous breeding season.",
        "Normally you try to catch a croc by throwing a sort of a small anchor\nin and when the croc latches on to it you try and pull it out. Once it\nis out, about 10-15 people quickly jump and sit on it. (That’s the only\nway to prevent a croc from getting back into water!). With its mouth\nbound by rubber bands, the croc is then rolled onto a ladder, bound to\nit, lifted and carried to the pit that it has to be transferred to. An\naverage adult croc is about 250 kg and about two to three metres long.\nIt takes 15-20 people to carry it.",
        "Once it is released in the pool the ropes and rubber bands are removed\nand the last unfortunate or brave man, depending on how you look at it,\nmakes a run for his life over the edge of the pond onto the safety of\ndry land.",
        "As we were transferring the male Gharial into a female mugger pit,\nHarry jokingly yelled: “What do you think we will get-a Ghammer?” Of\ncourse crocs only mate with others of their own species and there is no\nway a Gharial and mugger will get together. We were in fact\ntransferring the male here in order to give it a period of rest and\nrecovery from fighting with other males.",
        "Another time the exercise was because `Jaws III’ needed female company.\nJaws III is the biggest captive salt water crocodile in India. He is\nabout 16 feet and ranks may be, 3rd or 4th in the world in terms of his\nlength. Therefore, after Part II of `The Great White Man-eating Shark’\nwas produced, called Jaws II, the Croc Bank rightly decided to name its\ncrocodile `Jaws III’.",
        "Jaws III was a loner and would kill anything including other crocs\nwhich fell into his pit. So he lived a lonely, if majestic life.\nWhenever we jumped into his pit to clean it he would come charging at\nus even if he was in the water. He seemed to give us more exercise than\nall of us put together gave him. Anyway, the Croc Bank, after ten\nyears, finally felt it was time to find a him bride. Since he had on\nmore than one occasion bashed his head against a wall sensing a female\nin the opposite pit, we knew he was ready!",
        "The first female we caught was about to be thrown into his pit when I\nasked to examine her. (I had just learnt how to sex them). I began to\nfeel inside the crocodile and felt a hemipenis! “It’s a male,” I\nshouted. “Can’t be,” said Gerry, “let me check.” After a few seconds\nthere was a reassuring nod from Gerry: “Yes, Rom, it’s a male!”",
        "“Rahul, Champion Sexer,” cried Gerry.",
        "One cannot tell if crocs are male or female by their outward\nappearance. So, at the Croc Bank, after crocs grow to a certain length\nthey are sexed and markings are made on their scales. But workers can\nsometimes make mistakes while sexing small crocs. That’s perhaps how\nthe error occurred with the first bride we got for Jaws. I can’t\nimagine the plight of the poor chap had he been put in the pit with\nJaws. He would have been turned into minced meat in minutes.",
        "After that episode we physically examined every supposed female we\ncaught to be doubly sure of not making any error and found that most of\nthe supposed females turned out to be males! By then, most of the crocs\nhad run into the deepest part of the pond and we had hardly any crocs\nto choose a female from. Rom suggested chasing the females out of the\nwater onto the land, but that’s not easy at all. So he came up with\nanother idea.",
        "We got some iron gates and tied them together with a thick mesh net\nover it all. Then we had to wade into the green water with the net in\nfront of us. This would effectively push the crocs from the deep water\nonto the land. But the best of plans can go haywire and, instead, the\nreverse started happening. The crocs from the land started coming into\nthe water colliding with those being driven out by us. Thereafter there\nwas general commotion in the water and all the crocs started thrashing\nabout. One almost got my neighbour’s hand. I could feel the crocs at my\nfeet through the iron mesh that I held grimly onto. However we finally\naccomplished our dangerous mission and when we had driven a sufficient\nnumbers onto the land we were able to select a female for Jaws.",
        "Imagine Jaws’ surprise when he saw a companion after all those years.\nShe was exactly half his size in length and width. Perhaps he was just\nvery excited or maybe it was due to a normal state of male aggression,\nwe don’t know, because he just caught the hapless female croc between\nhis huge jaws and thrashed her about. “Croc barbecue is delicious”,\nsaid Tharak expecting the poor creature to perish any moment.\nFortunately or unfortunately, his wish was not fulfilled. The female\nsurvived although with quite a few bloody marks. Thereafter she kept\nher distance from the water as any sane creature would, avoiding Jaws\nlike the plague.",
        "Much later, when I visited Croc Bank a second time, it was the breeding\nseason and there were a few nests to be excavated everyday. Each nest\nwould occupy about the space of a medium size basket. Each egg was at\nleast three times the size of a hen’s egg and they usually numbered\naround 30 to 35. Every female-and each one of these measured from about\n2 m to 3.5 m-would determinedly guard her nest, refusing to budge when\nwe tried to chase her into the water in order to clean the pit.",
        "There is now a problem of excess population of the mugger crocodiles\nat the Croc Bank partly because they breed twice as much at the croc\nbank compared to in the wild and also due to their high survival rate.\nIn the wild, at the most, one or two survive out of the 30-35 eggs as\nmany are lost to predators, etc., but here due to artificial\nincubation, special enclosures, etc., a large number tend to survive.\nTherefore the croc bank has stopped all breeding of this species which\nmeant that we had a surfeit of eggs for breakfast! We used to scramble\nthe salty eggs and finish them off with sauce, although a larger number\nused to be sent raw for the monitor lizards’ breakfast.",
        "I sometimes went snake hunting with the Irulas. The Irulas are tribals\nthat are expert at snake catching. They formerly caught snakes for the\nsnake skin industry. After the ban, they went out of business and found\nit difficult to make a living because they did not own land and did not\nknow how to cultivate fields or do any trade at all. After the croc\nbank opened they were back in the business they excelled in, but this\ntime it was to save people and snakes with snake venom extraction.",
        "Carrying only a crowbar and a few cloth bags, they would set out,\noverturning every bush and digging any hole that showed signs of a\nsnake in it. Their crowbar had three uses, namely: (1) to shine light\ninto the burrow; (2) to dig the hole and (3) to handle the snake.\nDuring my outings with the dark, short, curly haired snake hunters, we\ncaught striped keelbacks, ratsnakes and also black scorpions.",
        "Apart from snakes the Irulas also caught rats. These rats, which\ndestroy crops and fields, build their burrows within the bunds. After\ncatching the rats, the Irulas would take away the rice which the rats\nhad stowed away and cook it to eat with the field rat meat. These\noutings were long, hot and tiring but I found them nonetheless\nenjoyable.",
        "The Irulas also taught me a lot about snake handling. I learnt to\nhandle the four poisonous snakes of India (the “Big Four”, i.e. Cobras,\nCommon Kraits, Russel’s Vipers, Saw-scaled Vipers) and also Pit Vipers\nand Pythons.",
        "Snakes were kept in mud pots that were placed in the snake room (no\ndifferent from an ordinary bedroom). Outside, a board merely announced:\n`Danger: Snakes Loose’. This was done to discourage intruders. But\nreally speaking, snakes were let loose only under supervision. There\nwas a small canal of water outside to prevent ants from entering the\nroom. (You may not believe it but ants can reduce a snake to a\nskeleton.) Next, there was a little space outside the room and about 1\nto 2 metres after, a smooth wall, about a metre high. I used to remove\nthe snakes from their pots, put them to drink water in the canal and\nthen clean the pots. During this exercise I would take the opportunity\nto improve my skills at handling the snakes. Basically one has to hold\nthe tail with one hand and control the snake using the snake hook (a\nlong stick with an iron hook at the end) with the other.",
        "Bites! That’s practically the first question anyone asks me when I talk\nof my croc bank vacation. Did I get bitten? Yes, several times, mostly\nby accident. But sometimes I allowed myself to be bitten just for the\nheck of it. I recall once when a ratsnake gave me a bite on the nose. I\ntried to prevent Rom seeing it but he found out soon enough by the\nblood on my shirt. A bite from a ratsnake is not painful but it bleeds\nlike a leaking tap. “Don’t worry, Rahul,” Rom said cheerfully, “the\nvenom will not take effect for another half an hour.” (Ratsnakes are\nnon-poisonous.)",
        "Another time I was getting a picture taken of myself with a baby\ncrocodile when it turned round and bit me. That was quite bad! Imagine\na sawing machine running over your hand. But I was cool, and happy that\nI had been bitten by a crocodile!",
        "Then I was dumb enough to try the bite of a wall lizard that Gerry had\ncaught to feed to his pit vipers. The scar, still on my hand, reminds\nme also of the chequered keelback bite I got in Pune (the one which got\nso bad that I couldn’t wear my watch for a few days).",
        "And on the last day of my stay at Croc Bank the red-eared turtle which\nI was taking away as my gift and souvenir from Croc Bank bit me so bad\nthat I could see my flesh and I could barely use my hand for a few\ndays.",
        "Now when I look back I think I was collecting bites in much the same\nway that some people collect trophies. Although this may appear quite a\nfoolish thing to do and perhaps it was too (some of the bites were\nquite painful), one good thing did come out of all those bites. I have\nno paranoid fear of such bites any longer. I am very careful when I\nhandle reptiles and take all the precautions that I have been taught\nbut I know that I would not be terror stricken should I get bitten and\nwould know what remedial steps to take.",
        "Apart from my practical studies, there was a huge library at the Croc\nBank where I would browse through several books on crocs, snakes,\nmonitors, turtles, the works. It was always with great pleasure that I\nwould search for information about something that I had learnt or seen\nthat day. And the best part is that although I didn’t have to memorize\nthe facts for any examination, nothing of what I read has gone out of\nmy head.",
        "And then, there was always time for fun. Sometimes I would go to\nHarry’s house where Tharaq and I played music or recorded songs. Other\ntimes, I would watch a movie at Rom’s. There was time for barbecues of\nfield rats, froglegs, frankfurters, parrot fish, chicken and beef,\nrounded off with chocolate cake. The beach at the back was for swimming\nduring the day and catching crabs during the night.",
        "One of the interesting happenings at the time that I was there was the\narrival of a film team from the magazine National Geographic to film\nthe King Cobras at the Bank. I became one of the many hands-on they had\nfor the job: I would assist in various ways like holding the flash,\nhelping with the setting up of shots, catching and re-catching the\nfrogs as they scampered off during the numerous retakes.",
        "One lazy afternoon Tharaq suggested a haircut for me. My hair was by\nthen really long. In fact I had not put a scissor to it since the\nbeginning of my sabbatical. So now it stood nearly at shoulder length.\nHe told me he had one and a half months’ experience in hair cutting. I\nwas thus persuaded to take up his offer of a “free” haircut in the\n\"latest style”.",
        "I explained in great detail to Tharaq how I wanted it cut and he\nnodded attentively making a few suggestions here and there. Then he\nstarted to work with the scissors, cutting and shaving here and there.\nWhen he announced that he had finished he produced a mirror and I\nlooked into the face of an unrecognisable Rahul with a hairstyle of\ntriangles sitting amidst shaved parts and a long strand of hair in the\nfront. I looked crazier than any rock star! It was only then that I\nlearnt that Tharaq did not know the ABC of haircutting, much less\nhairstyling and that he had just had a great time experimenting on my\nhead.",
        "Anyway I decided that now was a good time to try out the “bald look\"\nand so I got to a proper barber and had my hair shaved off completely.\nIt was truly liberating. I took several pictures of myself at this time\nwith the reptiles at the croc bank to remember my days here and also to\nrecord for posterity my new look.",
        "I felt truly sorry when it was time for me to leave Croc Bank. I\npromised everyone that I’d be back soon. I carried a souvenir with me-a\nred-eared turtle (which I still have) and some turtle eggs.",
        "I travelled through the night on a bus to Bangalore. At my foot was the\nturtle in a box and I had left a small opening for her to breathe.\nSuddenly I noticed that the turtle was out and was already making for\nthe door of the bus. I quickly caught her and put her back without any\nof the sleeping passengers noticing it except for a dear old lady who\nsmiled and said, “Dropped your water bottle, son?”",
        "Field Work Notes:\nCrocodiles",
        "Living millions of years before man, but today facing extinction...with\nmany myths about them and very little known about their nature. Many\nare considered dangerous. None are considered useful. Who are these\ncreatures? They are called crocodiles, alligators and lizards.",
        "There are 21 species of crocodiles and alligators in the world.",
        "Three species of crocodiles are found in India, namely:",
        "1) the Gharials-which are fish-eating crocodiles;",
        "2) the Muggers; and",
        "3) the Salt-water crocodiles.",
        "The biggest and the most dangerous of all crocodiles in the world is\nthe salt water crocodile, which can grow upto 25 feet. It is the only\ncrocodile that can live in the sea for a long time. The Nile crocodile\nof Africa is yet another deadly species. Fossils of three other extinct\nspecies of crocodiles have also been found in India.",
        "These cold blooded animals have evolved with dinosaurs millions of\nyears ago and are more closely related to birds than to snakes or\nreptiles. Being cold blooded they control their body temperature by\nseeking shady, sunny spots or different levels in water. They often\nbask with their jaws open, which probably helps them to keep cool.",
        "Their eyes, nose and ears are positioned in a straight line along with\nhead and snout. They have good eyesight and a good sense of smell, and\ncan hear very well. Their tail is very strong and helps them in\nswimming. They have a very low metabolic rate and thus need to hunt\nonly every few days. They can decrease their metabolic rate and stay\nunder water for a long time. Alligators have been known to stay under\nwater for upto 6 hours. They do not make any unnecessary movements but\ncan move very fast even on land when necessary. Small salties can\ngallop at a speed of 48 kph for short distances.",
        "Crocodiles are found in large and small rivers, lakes, mangroves, and\nin brackish and fresh water. When a baby crocodile hatches, it is just\nabout three quarters of a foot (25-30 cms) in length. In a few years it\nmatures into an adult. Maturity depends upon size rather than on age.\nGenerally males mature slower than females.",
        "In the wild, a female will take between 5-7 years to mature whereas\nmales will take 9-11 years. Gharials take longer to mature; about 8-10\nyears for the female and 12 years for the male. In captivity, such as\nin the Madras Crocodile Bank, females mature in four years and males in\nfive.",
        "The average size for maturity for a Mugger is-male (2 metres) and\nfemale (1.6 metres). Males of Gharials and Salties mature at three and\na half metres and females at three metres.",
        "Mugger crocodiles breed in between February and April. Salties breed in\nApril and Gharials between the last week of March to the second week of\nApril.",
        "Breeding depends on environmental conditions. In the breeding season\nmales often fight for the right to court with several females. During\ncourtship each pair may blow bubbles, rub noses, raise their snout and\nperiodically submerge and re-emerge. Different species show different\ncourtship displays. Gharials, for example, often court each other by\nmaking a loud buzzing sound. Mating occurs under water with the male\nmounted on top of the female.",
        "The average gestation period is between 35-60 days. The gestation for a\nMugger is 35-40 days and for Gharials and Salties, 40-65 days. The\ntemperature at which eggs are incubated and the moisture content of the\nenvironment (humidity) influence the sex within the embryo.",
        "Crocodiles will either dig a hole about 30 cms deep or pile up leaves\nto incubate their eggs. They sometime splash water on the nest to\ncontrol the temperature. In mugger crocs, females are exclusively\nproduced at constant temperature of 28¡C through 31¡C. At 32.5¡C only\nmales are produced. Both sexes in varying proportion are produced at\n31.5 to 33¡C.",
        "The female guards the nest. At the time of hatching the young start\ncroaking so the mother (sometimes even the father) digs open the nest.\nThen she cracks some of the eggs with her teeth to set free the young\nand carries them to the water in her mouth. The adult crocodiles\ncontinue to guard the young until they are about 5-7 months old.",
        "Crocodiles have many uses in nature’s ecosystem. They help keep the\nenvironment clean by eating the carcasses that would otherwise rot.\nThey capture the diseased, wounded and weaker prey thus letting only\nthe strongest survive and thus maintaining a healthy population and\nkeeping up the genetic quality of their prey species.",
        "In the dry season, wallows and tunnels dug by crocs provide essential\nwater for other animals, turtles and fish. Many animals depend upon\ncrocs for food for e.g. the sacred Ibis and monitor lizard will eat the\neggs of the Nile crocodile. Crocs are also exceptionally resistant to\ndisease and thus may be of great use in medical research.",
        "January brought fresh experience for me and it happened entirely\nbecause of Hartman de Souza. I was to return to Goa via Bangalore and\nsince our good friends, Hartman and Ujwala, live in Bangalore and had\nexpressed willingness to accommodate me, should I need a place to stay\nfor a while during my sabbatical, my parents suggested that I spend a\nfew days there before returning home. I was to stay at their place,\nsight-see Bangalore if I liked and inform my parents as soon as I was\nready to return. This then was the general plan.",
        "I reached Bangalore at 1.40 p.m. on the 7th of January. Bing (that’s\nhow we all call Hartman) was at the bus-stand to pick me up, with his\ncar. We drove to his house, me chatting away in reply to all his\nquestions. At home there was Ujwala and their kids, Zuri and her\nyounger brother, Zaeer. Also living with them at the time was Mrs Kalai\nwho was Bing’s colleague at the India Foundation for the Arts.",
        "After settling down to a good meal and generally relaxing, Bing told me\nthat he had in mind a few people and institutions connected with my\ninterest i.e., wildlife and that I should use my time in Bangalore to\nmeet them. I agreed to his suggestion, little realizing that the people\nhe suggested I meet would make their own suggestions about other people\nI should meet and when I would report this information to Bing, he\nwould insist that I go and meet them as well. So I spent quite a few\ndays meeting, or writing to, various persons connected with wildlife in\nBangalore.",
        "Bing is quite a hard taskmaster and he would not let me off easily; if\nthe people were not in station at that time or, if the names suggested\nwere not from Bangalore, I had to write to them instead. I wrote\nnumerous letters as a result. The general purpose of this activity was\nthat I should get an idea of what options were there for me if I\ndecided to pursue a career in wildlife eventually. Bing also suggested\nthat I should try to find out how and why these people decided to take\nto environment and wildlife studies, whether they were happy in their\nchoices and so on.",
        "Bing made several copies of an introductory cum reference letter for me\nwhich I was to give to the people I was to meet. The letter, which was\nsigned by him, stated that I had taken a one year sabbatical to explore\nwildlife which I had done for the past eight months and that I would\nlike to have a small interview with the person concerned. I also\nprepared small questionnaires to help me in the interviews. Bing would\nmost often phone the person in advance and make the appointment for me.\nSometimes he even reached me to the place; at other times I went in a\nrickshaw.",
        "The first person I met was Mr T. Parameswarappa, Retd. Principal Chief\nConservator of Forests. I reached Mr Parameswarappa’s house at 11.45\na.m. I had an appointment with him at 12.30 p.m. However Mr\nParameswarappa was out and did not arrive home until 1.30 p.m. So I sat\nand looked at a couple of books in his office. Soon after he returned\nwe began to talk, first about my sabbatical and then about what I\nwanted to do in the future.",
        "He told me that after graduation, one must answer a competitive\nexamination held by the Union Public Service Commission. The students\nwho are selected are trained and then posted to a forest. At the\nUniversity of Agricultural Sciences at Dharwad or Hebbal, a four year\ncourse on forestry can be done after completing pre-university. At the\nWildlife Research Institute short courses may be available, he said,\nbut after graduation long courses are definitely available.",
        "I asked him some questions and I relate briefly the interview I had\nwith him:",
        "Rahul: Is it possible to have a ranger give you a private guided tour\nwithin the Banargatta Wildlife Sanctuary?",
        "Parmeswarappa: I’m afraid not. There are only routine safaris for\nvisitors. But if you like you can meet Mr Venkatesh, Deputy Conservator\nof Forests and give him my reference.",
        "R: What is the condition of the sanctuary?",
        "P: It is a government initiative and as you can expect, there are good\nand bad points to all such activities.",
        "R: Are there any unusual career courses offered in Wildlife?",
        "P: In India there are no privately run sanctuaries or zoos. Therefore\nany career in wildlife or forestry must be through the government. This\nmakes it almost impossible to have any rare or unusual career courses.",
        "R: What are the duties of the staff at the Banargatta Park?",
        "P: Their only duty is to see to the well-being of the animals i.e. feed\nthem and keep their surroundings clean. They do not study or do\nresearch on the animals.",
        "R: How did you acquire this post of Principal Chief Conservator of\nForests? What was your background?",
        "P: Like you, I had to study. I answered an examination and got a job\nas a forest officer. Later I went to the US for two years and on my\nreturn I was appointed as Chief Conservator of Forests.",
        "R: Is it possible to set up a Snake Park for doing snake venom\nextraction?",
        "P: Of course it is possible. But one must apply for a\nlicence/permission for keeping wild snakes in captivity. Pune Snake\nPark will know the procedure and if you write to them they will give\nyou all the details.",
        "Mr Parameswarappa proved to be a very friendly and helpful person.\nBefore I left I showed him copies of the letters which I had already\nsent to the Indira Gandhi Research Institute and to the Indian Wildlife\nResearch Institute at Dehradun.",
        "My second appointment was with Mr Arun Kotankar, one of the main\npersons running an organisation called Samvad which has a programme\ncalled SMILE (Student Mobilisation Initiative for Learning) in\nBangalore. I reached the office at 10.30 a.m. although my appointment\nwas at 12 o’clock. I showed him my reference letter and in a little\nwhile he sat to talk with me.",
        "Mr Kotankar told me about the SMILE programmes in Bangalore. On\nSaturday afternoons they have an informal open house at Samvad. They\nwatch a film, have a debate or just talk on a specific topic of\ninterest to students, like tourism, dowry, child abuse, fisherfolk’s\nstruggles or topics like marriage, love, education or parents.",
        "Students also visit organisations working with dalits, tribals, women,\nstreet children, fisherpeople, etc. One can also learn environmental\nconservation. If the students cannot go to far off places and have to\nstay back during vacations, they are advised to take up campaigns or\nundertake studies on local problems like child labour, environmental\ndegradation, construction workers’ rights, etc.",
        "Shodhane which means `search’ is a newsletter brought out by students\nwho have been to these exposure camps and they write about their\nexperiences during the exposure or generally about other social\nconcerns. One can contribute articles, poems, cartoons or stories in\nKannada and English. I was quite interested to hear all that Mr\nKotankar had to say about this organisation.",
        "Later, I went straight to St. Joseph’s College where according to the\ninformation Bing had, there were various environmental courses being\nconducted for college students. I met one of the clerks in the college\noffice who gave me the information I requested and also a pamphlet\nlisting the different courses one could take after graduation.",
        "Two days later I went to meet Dr Harish Gaonkar at his house, at 11\na.m. Both he and his wife (who is German) were very friendly and I\nspent a lot of time talking with Mr Gaonkar who is a specialist on\nbutterflies.",
        "I learnt from him that butterflies are insects that are more closely\nrelated to plants than to insects. From the number of species of\nbutterflies in an area, a butterfly collector can also find out the\nnumber of species of plants in that area. This is because each species\nof butterfly will use only a certain plant/plants species. For example,\nin Goa, there are about 250 species of butterflies, that means that\nthere are about 900 to 1,000 plant species in Goa. This information\nwould be much more difficult for a pure botanist to give. Thus\nbutterflies are an ideal medium for a botanist who wishes to have an\nidea of the plant species in the locality.",
        "Eggs are laid by the mother butterflies in distinct places on leaves to\navoid predators from feeding upon them. They hatch within two to three\ndays. The larvae will moult many times (on an average five) to become a\npupa. During the pupa stage, it does not feed and after a few days it\nemerges as a butterfly. It waits for about 10 minutes to dry its wings\nin the sun and then flutters away. The whole process to become an adult\nmay take a period of five weeks to two months. Then the butterfly will\nlive for about 2 weeks, and within the first few days, will lay only\none batch of eggs.",
        "Moths are the ones that spin silk. No butterfly spins silk. There are\nabout 10,000 species of moths in the world-much more than butterflies.\nSome butterflies and moths are poisonous e.g. the Crimson Rose, even\nfound in Goa. It is a butterfly with wings and a red body. It also has\nred dots on its wings and black dots on its body. The smallest\nbutterflies are about a few centimetres in size and one of the biggest\nbutterflies is about the size of two palms put together.",
        "At the end of the meeting Dr Gaonkar showed me some books on\nbutterflies and some papers written by him on the subject. At around\n1.30 p.m. I took leave of him and left for MES College where I had an\nappointment with Dr Leela for the same afternoon. There I saw preserved\ndolphin tails and specimens of hammer-headed sharks.",
        "My stay in Bangalore also became very special because of the Times of\nIndia programme that Bing managed to arrange for me. The Times of India\nin Bangalore has a special section called “Newspaper in Education”. One\nof the programmes of NIE is to have workshops in schools on varied\ntopics. On the 20th of January, I went to The Times office on M.G. Road\nand after talking with the person in charge for sometime about what I\nhad been doing during the past year I was asked whether I would take a\nfew workshops in some schools over the next couple of days. Although I\nwas not too certain how well I would do this job I agreed because if\nthere is one thing I learnt during my sabbatical it is that one should\nalways give a try to anything new because things are not always as hard\nas they might appear to be. So I said yes.",
        "My first workshop was on the 22nd of January. I was picked up by one of\nthe organisers from NIE and taken to the Srivani Education Centre where\nI was to speak to the students of Standard VIII. I was expected to\nspeak for about 35 minutes and keep around 10 minutes for questions or\ndiscussion.",
        "I was a bit nervous at first but as the talk progressed and I found\nthe students listening attentively I talked more freely. After these\nsessions were over I would be dropped back home or to Hartman’s office\nwhichever was nearer. After the first few schools went off well and I\nbecame accustomed to the routine I found myself enjoying these classes.\nI was even more pleased to learn that I would be paid Rs.100 per\nworkshop plus my travel costs.",
        "For the talk I would start by telling the students about my sabbatical,\nhow the idea came up, the various places I had visited and the various\nthings I had done so far. After that I would speak about two\ntopics-vermiculture and snakes-because I thought that these would be of\nmost use to the students. Vermiculture because they could practise this\nat home to process the garbage into compost and snakes because people\nhave so many fears about them.",
        "When I talked about vermiculture, particularly about mixing cowdung\nwith soil, sometimes the girls and boys would find it distasteful and\nwould make jokes about it or laugh at the idea and I would think that\nthese are city kids and they don’t know anything about cowdung. But\nstill I would continue to explain how a vermipit can be set up in their\nhomes.",
        "On snakes, I would first give general information about poisonous and\nnon-poisonous snakes, and how to identify the poisonous ones. Then I\nwould tell them what should be done if someone got a snake bite. I\nwould also discuss the various beliefs that people have about snakes\nand which of them are myths. Depending on the time left, I would speak\nabout other things too, like crocodiles, turtles or spiders.",
        "At the end of the class, I would show them croc teeth, photos of myself\nwith snakes, crocs, monitors, etc., and then my red-eared turtle that I\nalways carried around with me in my bag. At this point there would be\nmaximum excitement. Everyone would crowd around, some would ask to hold\nthe turtle and they would ask questions about its eating habits etc. I\nwould allow them to touch the shell and nothing more because the turtle\nis very nasty and bites.\nIn this fashion I took workshops at several other schools including\nNational English School, Sindhi School, St. Mary’s School, Bolivian\nGirls School and Bangalore International School. I usually spoke to the\nstudents of Class VII to X. At Bangalore International School however\nthe workshop was for the students of Class III and IV.",
        "A few months later back in Goa I was pleased when the postman handed me\na registered letter from NIE, Bangalore which contained a cheque for\nRs.1075, my full earnings for giving the lectures. Later when I wrote\nan article on my one year sabbatical for the Hindustan Times I sent a\ncopy to NIE and they too published it in their newsletter. Newspaper in\nEducation has also invited me to take more workshops whenever I am in\nBangalore.",
        "Bangalore was very enjoyable in many other ways as well. One morning I\nwent to a swimming pool with Kalia and got the shock of my life on\njumping into the water; it was freezing cold! I resolved never to try\nswimming in Bangalore in the winter again.",
        "I ate out often especially during the day and tried out various small\neating joints (Bangalore has plenty of them), sampling South Indian\nfood, vegetable cutlets, milk shakes and so on. Of course, I constantly\nhad to watch my purse, for my budget did not allow lavish eating.\nSometimes I went to a book shop, sometimes I did small errands for Bing\nand Ujwala, and I recall helping Bing with the cooking on at least two\noccasions and occasionally helping Ujwala with her garden.",
        "I also used to accompany Bing and Ujwala and their two kids on family\noutings. Once we went to a lake called Sanki Tank where I enjoyed\nmotorboat rides and then played with Zuri and Zaeer in a small\nchildren’s park. Another time, we all went to see a dance performance\nthat I didn’t understand too much about. Sometimes we all just went out\nfor a drive (I enjoyed these rides best) and then would have ice-cream\ncones on the way home.",
        "I must tell you how I learnt to eat vegetables. I have generally\ndisliked vegetables as far as I can remember. My mum tells me that she\nregularly fed me vegetables as a baby and we have always had one or two\nvegetables on the table at home for any meal. Still I would generally\nrefuse vegetables and preferred to stick to fish curry and rice, our\nstaple food in Goa.",
        "When I was starting on my travels my parents warned me that in several\nplaces the food would be only vegetarian, and that did happen to be the\ncase. During the year I learnt how to eat all types of food at\ndifferent people’s houses. But I stuck to veggies I could tolerate like\ncabbage and potatoes or I would eat the dhal and rice with pickles. I\nhad still not started eating vegetables like ladyfinger and brinjal.\nBing found out about this when chatting with me and said that he hated\nanybody making a fuss about food. So everyday while eating he would put\na huge helping of vegetables on my plate. Especially the ones I didn’t\nlike, like tomatoes, brinjal and ladyfinger.",
        "I would finish the vegetables first so that I could enjoy the better\npart of the meal i.e. the meat or fish without having to deal with the\nveggies. But no sooner had I finished the vegetables, he would say: “Oh\nlovely, you like this vegetable? Have another helping!” and despite my\nprotests I would get another huge helping of vegetable. In this way I\nwould eat about three times the quantity of vegetables as I took the\nfirst time before I finally ended my meal.",
        "Eventually, I stayed on in Bangalore for three weeks, returning home\nonly on the 30th of January. I had not met my parents and brothers for\nnearly 3 months and was eager to share my experiences with them.\nUnfortunately when I arrived, I got just an hour or so to chat with my\nparents as they were leaving that very day for a 10-day stay in Delhi\nto attend the World Book Fair along with some of the staff from Other\nIndia Bookstore. So I had to wait till their return to regale them with\nmy tales.",
        "But in the meanwhile there were my two younger brothers eager to know\nabout my travels, my neighbours who hadn’t seen me for five months and\nof course my old pals like Ashok who were happy to welcome me in their\nmidst again.",
        "I was at home for practically the entire month of February, partly\nbecause my parents themselves were away for nearly half the month and\nhad asked me to help in the house during that time. Also, I had to\nre-plan my programme for the last few months of my sabbatical and some\ntime was always needed for replies to be got from the people we had\nwritten to.",
        "I found that I had completed most of the things I had set out to do\nduring my sabbatical though there were a few areas like honey bees for\nwhich definite programmes had not yet been worked out.",
        "I busied myself during this time with writing out those special essays\nof the past couple of months that I had not yet completed (though my\ndaily diary was up-to-date and in perfect order).",
        "I also set up the earthworm vermicompost pit in our backyard. It was my\ndad’s idea that I should put into practice immediately the vermiculture\nthat I had learnt, since managing garbage is becoming a problem in\nalmost all households. His idea was that once I mastered the technique\nof setting up the vermipits by trial and error at home, I could set the\nsame type up with little variations if needed for friends of ours and\nlater for anyone who wanted this useful method of garbage management.",
        "Dad suggested that I prepare a large vermipit which would be suitable\nfor any family having a large compound like we have and also one or two\nsmall vermibeds which could be used by people living in flats who do\nnot have lots of space of their own. We would keep all the pits going\nby putting waste into all of them from time to time and this way I\ncould get experience on how the big and small pits both worked so that\nwhen people asked for such information I would readily have it.",
        "So to start with I had to construct a vermibed. I began with the tank\nitself which was to be of brick. We had a labourer doing some odd jobs\nat that time at our house and he said he knew a bit about how to cement\nbricks together, so he and I constructed this 3’ by 2’ by 4’ high tank\nof bricks. We mixed cement and sand in some rough proportion with\nwater. Within a day we had the bricks placed one over the other with\nthe cement mixture holding it all together. This was easy stuff I\nthought as I wrote out my record of how many bricks and the quantity of\ncement and sand we had used to construct the bed.",
        "Next day, I dutifully wet the construction twice as instructed in order\nto have the cement set. Imagine my shock when on the third day I found\nthat our entire tank was shaking and ready to collapse. I rushed off\nnext door to my neighbour Guru who took one look at the tank and told\nme that we would have to take down the whole thing and start from\nscratch again. Apparently we had not used the right proportion of\ncement and sand mixture, or laid the bricks right. Nor had we laid any\nfoundation for the structure. Masonry was not that simple, I realized.",
        "I immediately got down to carefully removing each brick without\ndamaging it as the bricks were to be re-used. Guru, the expert mason,\nthen came over to construct the tank, and I helped. In fact, we built\ntwo tanks that day: one large and one medium. I then prepared the\nvermipits and Yesu, our maid, was instructed to henceforth put all the\nhousehold wastes (except paper and plastic) into the pits, alternating\nbetween the different ones.",
        "We also started vermiculture in a wooden crate. Eventually the crate\nwas used as a seed bed and a fine crop of jackfruit seedlings was\nraised in the box. The other two vermipits (of brick) function well,\nand all our household waste is processed by the earthworms.",
        "At the end of February, I was eager and ready to set out again.\nAlthough some contacts for the study of bee-keeping had been made by my\ndad, I was personally not very much interested in the subject. Crocs,\nsnakes and the wild had gripped me and I was longing to get back to the\nCroc Bank.",
        "I also had another totally unrelated and unconnected programme that I\nwanted to accomplish, namely to improve my eyesight by taking a course\non eye care and learning eye exercises at the Eye Clinic at the\nAurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry.",
        "I came to know of the Eye Clinic through Farida, one of the resident\nstaff at Croc Bank. I have been wearing glasses since class IV when my\nmum made the discovery that the reason I was not copying lessons from\nthe blackboard was not because I was inattentive or disobedient but\nsimply because I couldn’t read clearly from the blackboard at all. Then\ncame the visit to the oculist and the mandatory spectacles.",
        "But I fervently wished to rid myself of these glasses ever since I\nheard that with eye exercises one can improve one’s eyesight. In fact,\nI had begun doing eye exercises with Sister Gemma, a Medical Mission\nSister who is associated with my parents’ work. I had continued these\nexercises when I was at the Croc Bank, where Farida seeing me at it,\nhad told me about the Eye Clinic at Aurobindo Ashram where I could get\nproper training.",
        "As I was also eager to return to my favourite Croc Bank and since\nPondicherry is not very far from Mamallapuram I proposed to my parents\nthat I be allowed to go to Pondicherry via Bangalore, complete the eye\ncourse there and then proceed to Croc Bank where I could spend a\nfortnight or so before returning to Goa. This would comfortably keep me\naway during the month of March when my brothers would be studying for\ntheir school finals and I would return in time to enjoy the April-May\nvacations when our cousins from Belgaum, Lucano and Ricardo, would join\nus for a whole summer season of mangoes, jackfruits and umpteen picnics\non the beach.",
        "My parents approved of my programme and on the 26th of February, I set\nout for Pondicherry. By now I was quite familiar with the routes and\ndid not need anyone to pick me up from the bus stops on arrival.\nHowever, I had phoned Bernard at Auroville earlier and made\narrangements to stay with him at Auroville for the duration of the\ncourse.",
        "I travelled by an overnight bus from Goa to Bangalore, rested briefly\nduring the day at Hartman’s place and caught the night bus again at\nBangalore bus station arriving at Pondicherry at 4 a.m. There a cycle\nrickshaw fellow managed to cheat me of Rs.40 by promising to take me to\nAuroville but instead depositing me at Aurobindo Ashram which was more\nor less next door to the bus stop.",
        "I had to get into another local bus to get to Auroville which was more\nthan 10 kms away and after walking a short distance was greeted by\nBernard, whom I knew, as I had met him some months earlier on my first\nvisit to Auroville. I stayed free of cost at Auroville in a room in\nBernard’s quarters, sharing with him the meals he prepared.",
        "I cycled twice a day from Bernard’s house to the Ashram. At the Ashram,\nI used to do my eye exercises and then return home. I did a total of 45\nkms of cycling per day i.e. 360 kms of cycling for the nine days that I\nwas there.",
        "The Ashram itself was an old building. Before you entered you had to\nleave your slippers outside and place a plastic tag, with a number, on\nthem; another tag, with the same number, you carried in your pocket as\nyou walked barefoot up the stairs of the ashram. The place reminded me\nof a retreat centre with people in meditative moods and soft Indian\nclassical music playing continuously.",
        "The first exercise was the most terrible one. I would have just reached\nthe Centre after cycling in the sun when honey drops would be put in my\neyes. I then had to stand sweating in the sun with my eyes burning\nbecause of the honey. (Honey is sweet on the tongue but burns in the\neyes.)",
        "The next exercise would be struggling to read fine print in the dark\nwith only a candle light burning. Next, one had to carry out the same\nexercise in normal sunlight, outside. There was an exercise involving\neye movement through the use of a small rubber ball, then the reading\nof a chart with letters and words of diminishing size in varying\ndegrees, bathing the eyes with steam, much in the same way as\ninhalation is done, and then cooling the eyes with cold cotton packs.\nFinally, there was the colour treatment, where one stares at bright\ncolours reflected over a lamp in a darkened room.",
        "Each exercise had to be performed a specific number of times with small\ndetails like opening, shutting and blinking of the eyes controlled to\nthe finest degree. After I finished I would return to rock music on a\nwalkman, on my way to Auroville.",
        "There was no charge for the 10 day course at the Ashram but at the end\nof it I paid Rs.77 for the material needed to enable me continue with\nthe exercises-namely, 4 bottles of eyedrops, 2 small jars of honey, one\nrubber ball, two charts and two booklets with fine print.",
        "I benefitted a lot from the course and within a month or so, after\nregularly doing the exercises, I was able to read without spectacles. I\nstill do the exercises, though not so regularly, and the best part is\nthat after having been a regular wearer of glasses I now have to use my\nglasses only occasionally, like when watching TV or movies-which I do\nvery rarely anyway since we do not have a TV set at home.",
        "After the course was over I was eager to get another look at the Croc\nBank and as per the prior arrangements made on telephone I set out for\nMamallapuram, once again, on the 7th of March.",
        "A funny, but expensive incident happened to me on the way.",
        "I got to the interstate bus station early that morning and waited till\n8 or 9 a.m. for the bus going to Mamallapuram to arrive. I started\nasking around and eventually I was directed by a bus driver to the\nMamallapuram bus.",
        "Before I could reached the bus a man dressed in a conductors’ uniform\nwalked towards me. “Where are you going?” he asked. “To Mamallapuram”,\nI replied. “Come, come with me”, said the man. We both got into the\nbus, I took a seat and he put my luggage on the overhead rack.\n\"Ticket”, he demanded. “How much?” I asked. “25 rupees”, he replied. I\nhanded over the amount to him.",
        "Shortly after the bus had started on its way, and to my astonishment,\nanother conductor appeared and started issuing tickets to the\npassengers. I explained that I had already paid Rs.25 to the other\nconductor only to find that there was no “other conductor”, only a\nclever cheat who had taken me for a ride while the bus was still\nstationary. I had to shell out another 18 rupees for my journey to the\nCroc Bank! What I found hard to accept was that the man was able to\ncheat me in front of all those passengers sitting in the bus. No one\nthought to tell me that he was not the real conductor.",
        "This time I stayed at the Croc Bank only for a week as Rom, Harry and\neveryone else on the farm were leaving for Kerala to continue with the\nNational Geographic film programme and there was little else I could do\nat the Croc Bank with everyone away.",
        "The summer vacation that year was great fun. My cousins from Belgaum\narrived on schedule and since no one had Board exams that year the\nholiday season began in the first week of April itself. We would enjoy\ntwo whole months of the sea, swimming as often as we could in the river\nthat joins the sea at Baga.",
        "One morning in May my dad asked me whether I’d like to participate in a\nproject that the Goa Foundation, an environment organisation of which\nmy dad is Executive Secretary, was organising for college students. I\nagreed. The project turned out to be field visits to the forests in\nBetim in order to identify which areas were still forest, which areas\nhad been cut down and by whom, which projects/constructions had come\nup, and so on. The two students who had opted for this project were\nStephen and Jerry, both from St. Xavier’s College, Mapusa doing their\ngraduation degree. I joined the team as an extra.",
        "On the morning of the 20th of May, Dad and I set out in the car for\nBetim. On the way we picked up Stephen and Jerry. Dad showed us the\ndifferent spots in and around the area he wanted us to cover and then\nleft.",
        "Steven was the leader of the team. He had obviously been briefed by Dad\non how we were to proceed for he soon took out a note book and started\nwriting notes. I took my notebook and wrote down some names of birds.\nStephen said that just in case anybody questioned us, we were to say we\nwere birdwatchers!",
        "We found two illegal houses in the middle of the forest and a huge\nclearing made by cutting a lot of big trees. The trees appeared to be\ncut with the use of an electric saw and tar was smeared on top of them\nto prevent further growth. Many logs were thrown nearby. It was a\ntiring task and being the month of May, it was extremely hot and my\nshoes had begun cooking my poor feet. Even if we saw a small path,\nSteven would insist we go to the end. Jerry would sometimes complain,\n\"Steven who the hell do you think will go down there, in that\ninaccessible valley, to cut trees?” But Steven was stubborn and would\nretort, “Jerry if we don’t go down there we will have it on our\nconscience that there was a path which we could have checked out but\ndidn’t.” So we trudged down each and every pathway we saw, howsoever\nnarrow and unused it appeared to be.",
        "On the second day, I went on my bicycle to Betim. We continued and we\nfound another two illegal houses and a big tree cut, on the hill. This\ntree was also smeared with tar. The exercise usually took the whole\nmorning and we would call it a day by about 2 p.m. or so.",
        "On the third day, my Dad and my cousin Luke joined us. We showed my\nfather the different spots we had visited, the places where trees were\ncut and the illegal houses. Dad had brought along a camera which he\ngave to Stephen to take photographs of the different patches of forest,\nthe felling and the constructions. In some areas we found that fire had\nbeen set to the area after the trees were cut and this had destroyed\nthe scrub bushes as well.",
        "I was glad that the fourth day would be the last, since by now I was\nquite tired of this assignment. I had a lot of thorn pricks all over my\nbody and they had become little itchy swellings. My feet were also sore\nand the heat was killing. But I carried on, as the project was near\ncompletion. On the hill we found a lot of houses, several of them\nillegal, coming up in the forest. We also found clear-felled plots with\nbarbed wire fences around.",
        "My part of the assignment was over that day and I received a small\nstipend for my work from the Goa Foundation. Steven and Jerry later\nprepared the project report with photographs and write-up. The report\nwas submitted by the Foundation to the Forest Department. The\ndepartment sent an officer to investigate the matter and also issued\norders not to allow felling or constructions in the area.",
        "A year had gone by since I had finished school and what an exciting\nyear it had been. Having to go to college now seemed quite tame in\ncomparison. But as I busied myself with filling up the admission forms\nand getting the ID card photographs ready another surprise awaited me,\nand it came from a totally unexpected place.",
        "I was invited to be Chief Guest at an Environment Day function to be\nheld in Belgaum on 5th June, World Environment Day, where I was to\nspeak on my experiences during the past year. This was surely the\ncrowning event of my one year sabbatical.",
        "The invitation came from Dileep Kamat who was one of the organisers of\nan environment awareness programme, which he and others in Belgaum had\norganised for school children during the previous month. The programme\nincluded painting and essay competitions. The concluding part of the\nprogramme was to be held on 5th June where the finalists would give\ntheir speeches and the winners of all the competitions would be given\ntheir prizes.",
        "Dileep, his wife Nilima and their son Partha are family friends of long\nstanding and whenever Uncle Dileep comes to Goa he stays with us. As he\nexplained, the purpose of the environment programme was to inculcate\nthe idea that one can do things on one’s own and one has to think out\nways and means for this. And so, he said, he had considered the idea of\ninviting a young person, whom the students could identify with, to\nspeak on the occasion. The Committee had wholeheartedly approved when\nhe suggested my name as I had done something quite unique during the\npast year; and the fact that my preference was in the field of ecology\nmade me an ideal choice, according to Uncle Dileep.",
        "Of course I was delighted and accepted the offer. Who wouldn’t be?\nUncle Dileep said that all my expenses would be taken care of. I had an\nuncle (my father’s youngest brother, Benjamin) at Belgaum, at whose\nhouse I could stay. There was only my bus ticket which the organisers\nhad to pay for.",
        "I started preparing my speech straightway as there was only a week left\nto go and I knew that I had do a good job as this was a big occasion\nfor me. As usual I turned to my mum for help. She helped me choose the\npoints I would speak on, then I wrote out my entire speech which she\ncorrected and I set about memorising it.",
        "Public speaking was not a major problem for me nor did I suffer from\nstage-fright as I had participated in several school competitions and\nalso represented my school in inter-school debates. In fact, I had been\nawarded the Best Speaker prize in my final year at school. Still,\nspeaking at a competition was one thing and being the main speaker for\nthe day was quite another.",
        "My mum gave me several tips on how to address the gathering, what I\nshould do if I felt I could not remember the next line and so on. I\nrehearsed the speech several times at home and when I left on 3rd June\nfor Belgaum I felt quite confident and well-prepared.",
        "Along with essentials like clothes to wear, etc. I carried with me in\nmy haversack my red-eared turtle, and another small turtle found\nlocally in Goa, the croc teeth and photos of myself at the Snake Park,\nthe Croc Bank, etc.",
        "I arrived in Belgaum on 4th June and was met at the bus stand by my\ncousin Lucano who took me straight to his home. That evening Uncle\nDileep came to our house, briefed me about the next day’s programme and\nwhen he left he took with him the photos which he said he would put up\non exhibition at the hall.",
        "The next day Lucano took me to the venue at 3 p.m. The function was\nheld in the school hall. There were children from several schools\nalready there along with their parents. I noticed my photos put up on a\ncardboard on one side of the hall. My uncle Benjamin and aunt Grace and\nmy other cousins also came for the function which began at 4 p.m. The\nhall was quite full when I entered. I was seated in front with my\ncousin Lucano next to me.",
        "The programme was compered by one of the students. It began with the\nprize winners of the elocution competition delivering their\nspeeches-one in English and the others in Marathi and Kannada. Then one\nof the students introduced me to the audience and I was called up to\nthe stage to deliver my speech. I spoke in English and initially had to\nhalt every little while for Uncle Dileep to translate what I had said\ninto Kannada. Fortunately, however, after a few rounds of this\nEnglish-Kannada speech it became obvious that the audience did not need\nthe Kannada translation since they all understood English quite well.\nThen it became easier for me to continue and I finished with great\nconfidence and was roundly applauded.",
        "As I had done in the workshops I had conducted in the Bangalore schools\nearlier, I then took out the red eared turtle which I carried around\nfor the audience to see at close quarters while my cousin took around a\nlocal turtle which those who wanted could handle. There were many\nstudents and parents who wanted to be photographed holding the turtles.\nI also showed the croc teeth to those who were interested.",
        "The compere then announced that they would like to get on with the rest\nof the programme, but in view of the fact that several students wanted\nto ask questions, a question-answer session would be held, after the\nprogramme of skits was over. I returned to my seat and watched the\nskits which were on the theme of ecology.",
        "After that was the prize distribution ceremony and I was called up to\nthe stage to hand out prizes to the winners of the various competitions\n(elocution, as well as dramatics and drawing which were held earlier).",
        "After this, the organisers allowed questions from the audience which I\nanswered on the spot. I was quite happy to find that the audience had\nheard me attentively for there were many questions both from students\nand adults. Most of these concerned information about snakes. From this\nI gathered that snakes not only frighten people but fascinate them as\nwell. The function ended at around 6.30 p.m. Before departing, the\norganizers gave me an envelope containing Rs.300 which more than amply\ncovered my expenses for the trip.",
        "Uncle Dileep invited Lucano and myself for dinner that night. On seeing\nthat he had an interest in keeping the small turtle, I happily left it\nbehind for him. Next morning I was pleasantly surprised to find that\none of the local Kannada papers had reported the previous day’s\nfunction and there was a photograph of me at the function and a report\non it as well. I was thrilled beyond words.",
        "Later I wrote an article on my one year sabbatical for the Hindustan\nTimes which appeared on the Youth Page together with a couple of\nphotographs and was pleased when my parents told me that several of\ntheir friends had read it and had complimented them and me for this\nbold and unusual step of taking a break from studies. The same article\nwas eventually carried by several other newspapers and magazines\nincluding The Utusan Konsumer in Malaysia.",
        "In my speech at Belgaum, in the workshops I had conducted at Bangalore\nfor the school students and in the article I wrote I always recommended\nat the end of my presentation that every student ask their parents for\na break from regular studies when they finished school as it is\nsomething they would never regret.",
        "And I wish to repeat here, at the end of my book, that June 1995 to\nJune 1996 was the most wonderful year that I can ever remember. I\nlearnt a lot, not only about the things I wanted to learn, but about\nmany other things as well. And best of all I had a lot of fun and a\nwhole lot of freedom to do all that I ever wanted to do. I certainly\nlook forward to another sabbatical! And so, by now, should you!",
