        "When to the Rhine King Etzel / his messengers had sent,\nWith hasty flight fresh tidings / from land to land there went:\nWith messengers full quickly / to his high festival\nHe bade them, eke and summoned. / To many thereby did death befall.",
        "1423",
        "The messengers o’er the borders / of Hunland thence did fare\nUnto the land of Burgundy; / thither sent they were\nUnto three lordly monarchs / and eke their mighty men.\nTo Etzel’s land to bid them / hastily they journeyed then.",
        "1424",
        "Unto Bechelaren / rode they on their way,\nWhere found they willing service. / Nor did aught delay\nRuediger to commend him / and Gotelinde as well\nAnd eke their fairest daughter / to them that by the Rhine did dwell.",
        "1425",
        "They let them not unladen / with gifts from thence depart,\nSo did the men of Etzel / fare on with lighter heart.\nTo Ute and to her household / sent greeting Ruediger,\nThat never margrave any / to them more well disposed were.",
        "1426",
        "Unto Brunhild also / did they themselves commend\nWith willing service offered / and steadfast to the end.\nBearing thus fair greeting / the messengers thence did fare,\nAnd prayed the noble margravine / that God would have them in his care.",
        "1427",
        "Ere the messengers had fully / passed o’er Bavarian ground,\nHad the nimble Werbel / the goodly bishop found.\nWhat greetings to his kinsmen / unto the Rhine he sent,\nThat I cannot tell you; / the messengers yet from him went",
        "1428",
        "Laden with gold all ruddy, / to keep his memory.\nThus spake the Bishop Pilgrim: / “’Twere highest joy to me\nMight I my sister’s children / here see in home of mine,\nFor that I may but seldom / go unto them to the Rhine.”",
        "1429",
        "What were the ways they followed / as through the lands they fared,\nThat can I nowise tell you. / Yet never any dared\nRob them of wealth or raiment, / for fear of Etzel’s hand:\nA lofty king and noble, / mighty in sooth was his command.",
        "1430",
        "Before twelve days were over / came they unto the Rhine,\nAnd rode into Worms city / Werbel and Schwemmelein.\nTold were soon the tidings / to the kings and their good men,\nHow that were come strange messengers. / Gunther the king did question\n      then.",
        "1431",
        "And spake the monarch further: / “Who here may understand\nWhence do come these strangers / riding unto our land?\"\nYet was never any / might answer to him make,\nUntil of Tronje Hagen / thus unto King Gunther spake:",
        "1432",
        "“To us hath come strange tidings / to hand this day, I ween,\nFor Etzel’s fiddlers riding / hither have I seen.\nThe same have by thy sister / unto the Rhine been sent:\nFor sake of their high master / now give we them fair compliment.”",
        "1433",
        "E’en then did ride the messengers / unto the castle door,\nAnd never royal minstrels / more stately went before.\nBy the monarch’s servants / well received they were:\nThey gave them fitting lodging / and for their raiment had a care.",
        "1434",
        "Rich and wrought full deftly / was the travelling-dress they wore,\nWherein they well with honor / might go the king before;\nYet they at court no longer / would the same garments wear.\nThe messengers inquired / if any were might wish them there.",
        "1435",
        "In sooth in such condition / many eke were found,\nWho would receive them gladly; / to such they dealt around.\nThen decked themselves the strangers / in garments richer far,\nSuch as royal messengers / beseemeth well at court to wear.",
        "1436",
        "By royal leave came forward / to where the monarch sat\nThe men that came from Etzel, / and joy there was thereat.\nHagen then to meet them / in courteous manner went,\nAnd heartily did greet them, / whereat they gave fair compliment.",
        "1437",
        "To know what were the tidings, / to ask he then began\nHow did find him Etzel / and each valiant man.\nThen answer gave the fiddler: / “Ne’er higher stood the land,\nNor the folk so joyous: / that shall ye surely understand.”",
        "1438",
        "They went unto the monarch. / Crowded was the hall.\nThere were received the strangers / as of right men shall\nKindly greeting offer / in other monarch’s land.\nMany a valiant warrior / saw Werbel by King Gunther stand.",
        "1439",
        "Right courteously the monarch / began to greet them then:\n“Now be ye both right welcome, / Hunland’s merry men,\nAnd knights that give you escort. / Hither sent are ye\nBy Etzel mighty monarch / unto the land of Burgundy?”",
        "1440",
        "They bowed before the monarch; / then spake Werbelein:\n“My dear lord and master, / and Kriemhild, sister thine,\nHither to thy country / give fairest compliment.\nIn faith of kindly welcome / us unto you they now have sent.”",
        "1441",
        "Then spake the lofty ruler: / “I joy o’er this ye bring.\nHow liveth royal Etzel,\" / further spake the king,\n“And Kriemhild, my sister, / afar in Hunland?\"\nThen answered him the fiddler: / “That shalt thou straightway understand.",
        "1442",
        "“That never any people / more lordly life might show\nThan they both do joy in, / –that shalt thou surely know,–\nWherein do share their kinsmen / and all their doughty train.\nWhen from them we parted, / of our journey were they fain.”",
        "1443",
        "“My thanks for these high greetings / ye bring at his command\nAnd from my royal sister. / That high in joy they stand,\nThe monarch and his kinsmen, / rejoiceth me to hear.\nFor, sooth to say, the tidings / asked I now in mickle fear.”",
        "1444",
        "The twain of youthful princes / were eke come thitherward,\nAs soon as they the tidings / from afar had heard.\nRight glad were seen the messengers / for his dear sister’s sake\nBy the young Giselher, / who in such friendly manner spake:",
        "1445",
        "“Right hearty were your welcome / from me and brother mine,\nWould ye but more frequent / ride hither to the Rhine;\nHere found ye friends full many / whom glad ye were to see,\nAnd naught but friendly favors / the while that in this land ye be.”",
        "1446",
        "“To us how high thy favor,\" / spake Schwemmel, “know we well;\nNor with my best endeavor / might I ever tell\nHow kindly is the greeting / we bear from Etzel’s hand\nAnd from your noble sister, / who doth in highest honor stand.",
        "1447",
        "“Your sometime love and duty / recalleth Etzel’s queen,\nAnd how to her devoted / in heart we’ve ever been,\nBut first to royal Gunther / do we a message bear,\nAnd pray it be your pleasure / unto Etzel’s land to fare.",
        "1448",
        "“To beg of you that favor / commanded o’er and o’er\nEtzel mighty monarch / and bids you know the more,\nAn will ye not your sister / your faces give to see,\nSo would he know full gladly / wherein by him aggrieved ye be,",
        "1449",
        "“That ye thus are strangers / to him and all his men.\nIf that his spouse so lofty / to you had ne’er been known,\nYet well he thought to merit / that him ye’d deign to see;\nIn sooth could naught rejoice him / more than that such thing might be.”",
        "1450",
        "Then spake the royal Gunther: / “A sennight from this day\nShall ye have an answer, / whereon decide I may\nWith my friends in counsel. / The while shall ye repair\nUnto your place of lodging, / and right goodly be your fare.”",
        "1451",
        "Then spake in answer Werbel: / “And might such favor be\nThat we the royal mistress / should first have leave to see,\nUte, the lofty lady, / ere that we seek our rest?\"\nTo him the noble Giselher / in courteous wise these words addressed.",
        "1452",
        "“That grace shall none forbid you. / Will ye my mother greet,\nTherein do ye most fully / her own desire meet.\nFor sake of my good sister / fain is she you to see,\nFor sake of Lady Kriemhild / ye shall to her full welcome be.”",
        "1453",
        "Giselher then led him / unto the lofty dame,\nWho fain beheld the messengers / from Hunland that came.\nShe greeted them full kindly / as lofty manner taught,\nAnd in right courteous fashion / told they to her the tale they brought.",
        "1454",
        "“Pledge of loyal friendship / sendeth unto thee\nNow my lofty mistress,\" / spake Schwemmel. “Might it be,\nThat she should see thee often, / then shalt thou know full well,\nIn all the world there never / a greater joy to her befell.”",
        "1455",
        "Replied the royal lady: / “Such thing may never be.\nGladly as would I oft-times / my dearest daughter see,\nToo far, alas, is distant / the noble monarch’s wife.\nMay ever yet full happy / with King Etzel be her life.",
        "1456",
        "“See that ye well advise me, / ere that ye hence are gone,\nWhat time shall be your parting; / for messengers I none\nHave seen for many seasons / as glad as greet I you.\"\nThe twain gave faithful promise / such courtesy full sure to do.",
        "1457",
        "Forthwith to seek their lodgings / the men of Hunland went,\nThe while the mighty monarch / for trusted warriors sent,\nOf whom did noble Gunther / straightway question make,\nHow thought they of the message. / Whereupon full many spake",
        "1458",
        "That he might well with honor / to Etzel’s land be bound,\nThe which did eke advise him / the highest ’mongst them found,\nAll save Hagen only, / whom sorely grieved such rede.\nUnto the king in secret / spake he: “Ill shall be thy meed.",
        "1459",
        "“What deed we twain compounded / art thou full well aware,\nWherefor good cause we ever / shall have Kriemhild to fear,\nFor that her sometime husband / I slew by my own hand.\nHow dare we ever journey / then unto King Etzel’s land?”",
        "1460",
        "Replied the king: “My sister / no hate doth harbor more.\nAs we in friendship kissed her, / vengeance she forswore\nFor evil that we wrought her, / ere that from hence she rode,–\nUnless this message, Hagen, / ill for thee alone forebode.”",
        "1461",
        "“Now be thou not deceived,\" / spake Hagen, “say what may\nThe messengers from Hunland. / If thither be thy way,\nAt Kriemhild’s hands thou losest / honor eke and life,\nFor full long-avenging / is the royal Etzel’s wife.”",
        "1462",
        "Added then his counsel / the princely Gernot there:\n“Though be it thou hast reason / thine own death to fear\nAfar in Hunnish kingdom, / should we for that forego\nTo visit our high sister, / that were in sooth but ill to do.”",
        "1463",
        "Unto that thane did likewise / Giselher then say:\n“Since well thou know’st, friend Hagen, / what guilt on thee doth weigh,\nThen tarry here behind us / and of thyself have care,\nAnd let who dares the journey / with us unto my sister fare.”",
        "1464",
        "Thereat did rage full sorely / Tronje’s doughty thane:\n“So shall ye ne’er find any / that were to go more fain,\nNor who may better guide you / than I upon your way.\nAnd will ye not give over, / know then my humor soon ye may.”",
        "1465",
        "Then spake the Kitchen Master, / Rumold a lofty thane:\n“Here might ye guests and kinsmen / in plenty long maintain\nAfter your own pleasure, / for ye have goodly store.\nI ween ye ne’er found Hagen / traitor to you heretofore.",
        "1466",
        "“If heed ye will not Hagen, / still Rumold doth advise\n–For ye have faithful service / from me in willing wise–\nThat here at home ye tarry / for the love of me,\nAnd leave the royal Etzel / afar with Kriemhild to be.",
        "1467",
        "“Where in the world might ever / ye more happy be\nThan here where from danger / of every foeman free,\nWhere ye may go as likes you / in goodliest attire,\nDrink wine the best, and stately / women meet your heart’s desire.",
        "1468",
        "“And daily is your victual / the best that ever knew\nA king of any country. / And were the thing not true,\nAt home ye yet should tarry / for sake of your fair wife\nEre that in childish fashion / ye thus at venture set your life.",
        "1469",
        "“Thus rede I that ye go not. / Mighty are your lands,\nAnd at home more easy may ye / be freed from hostile hands\nThan if ye pine in Hunland. / How there it is, who knows?\nO Master, go not thither, / –such is the rede that Rumold owes.”",
        "1470",
        "“We’ll ne’er give o’er the journey,\" / Gernot then did say,\n“When thus our sister bids us / in such friendly way\nAnd Etzel, mighty monarch. / Wherefore should we refrain?\nWho goes not gladly thither, / here at home may he remain.”",
        "1471",
        "Thereto gave answer Hagen: / “Take not amiss, I pray,\nThese my words outspoken, / let befall what may.\nYet do I counsel truly, / as ye your safety prize,\nThat to the Huns ye journey / armed full well in warlike guise.",
        "1472",
        "“Will ye then not give over, / your men together call,\nThe best that ye may gather / from districts one and all.\nFrom out them all I’ll choose you / a thousand knights full good,\nThen may ye reck but little / the vengeful Kriemhild’s angry mood.”",
        "1473",
        "“I’ll gladly heed thy counsel,\" / straight the king replied,\nAnd bade the couriers traverse / his kingdom far and wide.\nSoon they brought together / three thousand men or more,\nWho little weened what mickle / sorrow was for them in store.",
        "1474",
        "Joyful came they riding / to King Gunther’s land.\nSteeds and equipment for them / all he did command,\nWho should make the journey / thence from Burgundy.\nWarriors many were there / to serve the king right willingly.",
        "1475",
        "Hagen then of Tronje / to Dankwart did assign\nOf their warriors eighty / to lead unto the Rhine.\nEquipped in knightly harness / were they soon at hand.\nRiding in gallant fashion / unto royal Gunther’s land.",
        "1476",
        "Came eke the doughty Volker, / a noble minstrel he,\nWith thirty goodly warriors / to join the company,\nWho wore so rich attire / ’twould fit a monarch well.\nThat he would fare to Hunland, / bade he unto Gunther tell.",
        "1477",
        "Who was this same Volker / that will I let you know:\nHe was a knight full noble, / to him did service owe\nMany a goodly warrior / in the land of Burgundy.\nFor that he well could fiddle, / named the Minstrel eke was he.",
        "1478",
        "Thousand men chose Hagen, / who well to him were known.\nWhat things in storm of battle / their doughty arm had done,\nOr what they wrought at all times, / that knew he full well.\nNor of them might e’er mortal / aught but deeds of valor tell.",
        "1479",
        "The messengers of Kriemhild, / full loath they were to wait,\nFor of their master’s anger / stood they in terror great.\nEach day for leave to journey / more great their yearning grew,\nBut daily to withhold it / crafty Hagen pretext knew.",
        "1480",
        "He spake unto his master: / “Well shall we beware\nHence to let them journey / ere we ourselves prepare\nIn seven days thereafter / to ride to Etzel’s land:\nIf any mean us evil, / so may we better understand.",
        "1481",
        "“Nor may the Lady Kriemhild / ready make thereto,\nThat any by her counsel / scathe to us may do.\nYet if such wish she cherish, / evil shall be her meed,\nFor many a chosen warrior / with us shall we thither lead.”",
        "1482",
        "Shields well-wrought and saddles, / with all the mickle gear\nThat into Etzel’s country / the warriors should wear,\nThe same was now made ready / for many a knight full keen.\nThe messengers of Kriemhild / before King Gunther soon were seen.",
        "1483",
        "When were come the messengers, / Gernot them addressed:\n“King Gunther now is minded / to answer Etzel’s quest.\nFull gladly go we thither / with him to make high-tide\nAnd see our lofty sister, / –of that set ye all doubt aside.”",
        "1484",
        "Thereto spake King Gunther: / “Can ye surely say\nWhen shall be the high-tide, / or upon what day\nWe shall there assemble?\" / Spake Schwemmel instantly:\n“At turn of sun in summer / shall in sooth the meeting be.”",
        "1485",
        "The monarch leave did grant them, / ere they should take their way,\nIf that to Lady Brunhild / they would their homage pay,\nHis high pleasure was it / they unto her should go.\nSuch thing prevented Volker, / and did his mistress’ pleasure so.",
        "1486",
        "“In sooth, my Lady Brunhild / hath scarce such health to-day\nAs that she might receive you,\" / the gallant knight did say.\n“Bide ye till the morrow, / may ye the lady see.\"\nWhen thus they sought her presence, / might their wish not granted be.",
        "1487",
        "To the messengers right gracious / was the mighty king,\nAnd bade he from his treasure / on shields expansive bring\nShining gold in plenty / whereof he had great store.\nEke richest gifts received they / from his lofty kinsmen more.",
        "1488",
        "Giselher and Gernot, / Gere and Ortwein,\nThat they were free in giving / soon full well was seen.\nSo costly gifts were offered / unto each messenger\nThat they dared not receive them, / for Etzel’s anger did they fear.",
        "1489",
        "Then unto King Gunther / Werbel spake again:\nSire, let now thy presents / in thine own land remain.\nThe same we may not carry, / my master hath decreed\nThat we accept no bounty. / Of that in sooth we’ve little need.”",
        "1490",
        "Thereat the lord of Rhineland / was seen in high displeasure,\nThat they should thus accept not / so mighty monarch’s treasure?\nIn their despite yet took they / rich dress and gold in store,\nThe which moreover with them / home to Etzel’s land they bore.",
        "1491",
        "Ere that they thence departed / they Lady Ute sought,\nWhereat the gallant Giselher / straight the minstrels brought\nUnto his mother’s presence. / Kind greetings sent the dame,\nAnd wish that high in honor / still might stand her daughter’s name.",
        "1492",
        "Then bade the lofty lady / embroidered silks and gold\nFor the sake of Kriemhild, / whom loved she as of old,\nAnd eke for sake of Etzel, / unto the minstrels give.\nWhat thus so free was offered / might they in sooth right fain receive.",
        "1493",
        "Soon now had ta’en departure / the messengers from thence,\nFrom knight and fairest lady, / and joyous fared they hence\nUnto Suabian country; / Gernot had given behest\nThus far for armed escort, / that none their journey might molest.",
        "1494",
        "When these had parted from them, / safe still from harm were they,\nFor Etzel’s might did guard them / wherever led their way.\nNor ever came there any / that aught to take would dare,\nAs into Etzel’s country / they in mickle haste did fare.",
        "1495",
        "Where’er they friends encountered, / to all they straight made known\nHow that they of Burgundy / should follow after soon\nFrom Rhine upon their journey / unto the Huns’ country.\nThe message brought they likewise / unto Bishop Pilgrim’s see.",
        "1496",
        "As down ’fore Bechelaren / they passed upon their way,\nThe tidings eke to Ruediger / failed they not to say,\nAnd unto Gotelinde, / the margrave’s wife the same.\nAt thought so soon to see them / was filled with joy the lofty dame.",
        "1497",
        "Hasting with the tidings / each minstrel’s courser ran,\nTill found they royal Etzel / within his burgh at Gran.\nGreeting upon greeting, / which they must all bestow,\nThey to the king delivered; / with joy his visage was aglow.",
        "1498",
        "When that the lofty Kriemhild / did eke the tidings hear,\nHow that her royal brothers / unto the land would fare,\nIn sooth her heart was gladdened; / on the minstrels she bestowed\nRichest gifts in plenty, / as she to her high station owed.",
        "1499",
        "She spake: “Now shall ye, Werbel / and Schwemmel, tell to me\nWho cometh of my kinsmen / to our festivity,\nWho of all were bidden / this our land to seek?\nNow tell me, when the message / heard he, what did Hagen speak?”",
        "1500",
        "Answered: “He came to council / early upon a day,\nBut little was of pleasant / in what he there did say.\nWhen learned he their intention, / in wrath did Hagen swear,\nTo death ’twere making journey, / to country of the Huns to fare.",
        "1501",
        "“Hither all are coming, / thy royal brothers three,\nAnd they right high in spirit. / Who more shall with them be,\nThe tale to tell entire / were more than I might do.\nTo journey with them plighted / Volker the valiant fiddler too.”",
        "1502",
        "“’Twere little lost, full truly,\" / answered then the queen,\n“If by my eyes never / Volker here were seen.\n’Tis Hagen hath my favor, / a noble knight is he,\nAnd mickle is my pleasure / that him full soon we here may see.”",
        "1503",
        "Her way the Lady Kriemhild / then to the king did take,\nAnd in right joyous manner / unto her consort spake:\n“How liketh thee the tidings, / lord full dear to me?\nWhat aye my heart hath yearned for, / that shall now accomplished be.”",
        "1504",
        "“Thy will my joy was ever,\" / the lofty monarch said.\n“In sooth for my own kinsmen / I ne’er have been so glad,\nTo hear that they come hither / unto my country.\nTo know thy friends are coming, / hath parted sadness far from me.”",
        "1505",
        "Straight did the royal provosts / give everywhere decree\nThat hall and stately palace / well prepared should be\nWith seats, that unprovided / no worthy guest be left.\nAnon by them the monarch / should be of mickle joy bereft.",
