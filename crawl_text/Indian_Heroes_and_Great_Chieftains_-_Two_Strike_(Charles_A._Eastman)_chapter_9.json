        "It is a pity that so many interesting names of well-known Indians\nhave been mistranslated, so that their meaning becomes very vague\nif it is not wholly lost.  In some cases an opposite meaning is\nconveyed.  For instance there is the name, “Young-Man-Afraid-of-\nHis-Horses.”  It does not mean that the owner of the name is afraid\nof his own horse – far from it!  Tashunkekokipapi signifies “The\nyoung men [of the enemy] fear his horses.”  Whenever that man\nattacks, the enemy knows there will be a determined charge.",
        "The name Tashunkewitko, or Crazy Horse, is a poetic simile. \nThis leader was likened to an untrained or untouched horse, wild,\nignorant of domestic uses, splendid in action, and unconscious of\ndanger.",
        "The name of Two Strike is a deed name.  In a battle with the\nUtes this man knocked two enemies from the back of a war horse.  \nThe true rendering of the name Nomkahpa would be, “He knocked off\ntwo.”",
        "I was well acquainted with Two Strike and spent many pleasant\nhours with him, both at Washington, D. C., and in his home on the\nRosebud reservation.  What I have written is not all taken from his\nown mouth, because he was modest in talking about himself, but I\nhad him vouch for the truth of the stories.  He said that he was\nborn near the Republican River about 1832.  His earliest\nrecollection was of an attack by the Shoshones upon their camp on\nthe Little Piney.  The first white men he ever met were traders who\nvisited his people when he was very young.  The incident was still\nvividly with him, because, he said, “They made my father crazy,\"\n[drunk].  This made a deep impression upon him, he told me, so that\nfrom that day he was always afraid of the white man’s “mysterious\nwater.”",
        "Two Strike was not a large man, but he was very supple and\nalert in motion, as agile as an antelope.  His face was mobile and\nintelligent.  Although he had the usual somber visage of an Indian,\nhis expression brightened up wonderfully when he talked.  In some\nways wily and shrewd in intellect, he was not deceitful nor mean. \nHe had a high sense of duty and honor.  Patriotism was his ideal\nand goal of life.",
        "As a young man he was modest and even shy, although both his\nfather and grandfather were well-known chiefs.  I could find few\nnoteworthy incidents in his early life, save that he was an expert\nrider of wild horses.  At one time I was pressing him to give me\nsome interesting incident of his boyhood.  He replied to the effect\nthat there was plenty of excitement but “not much in it.”  There\nwas a delegation of Sioux chiefs visiting Washington, and we were\nspending an evening together in their hotel.  Hollow Horn Bear\nspoke up and said:",
        "“Why don’t you tell him how you and a buffalo cow together\nheld your poor father up and froze him almost to death?”",
        "Everybody laughed, and another man remarked: “I think he had\nbetter tell the medicine man (meaning myself) how he lost the power\nof speech when he first tried to court a girl.”  Two Strike,\nalthough he was then close to eighty years of age, was visibly\nembarrassed by their chaff.",
        "“Anyway, I stuck to the trail.  I kept on till I got what I\nwanted,” he muttered.  And then came the story.",
        "The old chief, his father, was very fond of the buffalo hunt;\nand being accomplished in horsemanship and a fine shot, although\nnot very powerfully built, young Two Strike was already following\nhard in his footsteps.  Like every proud father, his was giving him\nevery incentive to perfect his skill, and one day challenged his\nsixteen-year-old son to the feat of “one arrow to kill” at the very\nnext chase.",
        "It was midwinter.  A large herd of buffalo was reported by the\ngame scout.  The hunters gathered at daybreak prepared for the\ncharge.  The old chief had his tried charger equipped with a soft,\npillow-like Indian saddle and a lariat.  His old sinew-backed\nhickory bow was examined and strung, and a fine straight arrow with\na steel head carefully selected for the test.  He adjusted a keen\nbutcher knife over his leather belt, which held a warm buffalo robe\nsecurely about his body.  He wore neither shirt nor coat, although\na piercing wind was blowing from the northwest.  The youthful Two\nStrike had his favorite bow and his swift pony, which was perhaps\ndearer to him than his closest boy comrade.",
        "Now the hunters crouched upon their horses’ necks like an army\nin line of battle, while behind them waited the boys and old men\nwith pack ponies to carry the meat.  “Hukahey!” shouted the leader\nas a warning.  “Yekiya wo!” (Go) and in an instant all the ponies\nleaped forward against the cutting wind, as if it were the start in\na horse race.  Every rider leaned forward, tightly wrapped in his\nrobe, watching the flying herd for an opening in the mass of\nbuffalo, a chance to cut out some of the fattest cows.  This was\nthe object of the race.",
        "The chief had a fair start; his horse was well trained and\nneeded no urging nor guidance.  Without the slightest pull on the\nlariat he dashed into the thickest of the herd.  The youth’s pony\nhad been prancing and rearing impatiently; he started a little\nbehind, yet being swift passed many.  His rider had one clear\nglimpse of his father ahead of him, then the snow arose in blinding\nclouds on the trail of the bison.  The whoops of the hunters, the\nlowing of the cows, and the menacing glances of the bulls as they\nplunged along, or now and then stood at bay, were enough to unnerve\na boy less well tried.  He was unable to select his victim.  He had\nbeen carried deeply into the midst of the herd and found himself\nhelpless to make the one sure shot, therefore he held his one arrow\nin his mouth and merely strove to separate them so as to get his\nchance.",
        "At last the herd parted, and he cut out two fat cows, and was\nmaneuvering for position when a rider appeared out of the snow\ncloud on their other side.  This aroused him to make haste lest his\nrival secure both cows; he saw his chance, and in a twinkling his\narrow sped clear through one of the animals so that she fell\nheadlong.",
        "In this instant he observed that the man who had joined him\nwas his own father, who had met with the same difficulties as\nhimself.  When the young man had shot his only arrow, the old chief\nwith a whoop went after the cow that was left, but as he gained her\nbroadside, his horse stepped in a badger hole and fell, throwing\nhim headlong.  The maddened buffalo, as sometimes happens in such\ncases, turned upon the pony and gored him to death.  His rider lay\nmotionless, while Two Strike rushed forward to draw her attention,\nbut she merely tossed her head at him, while persistently standing\nguard over the dead horse and the all but frozen Indian.",
        "Alas for the game of “one arrow to kill!”  The boy must think\nfast, for his father’s robe had slipped off, and he was playing\ndead, lying almost naked in the bitter air upon the trampled snow. \nHis bluff would not serve, so he flew back to pull out his solitary\narrow from the body of the dead cow.  Quickly wheeling again, he\nsent it into her side and she fell.  The one arrow to kill had\nbecome one arrow to kill two buffalo!  At the council lodge that\nevening Two Strike was the hero.",
        "The following story is equally characteristic of him, and in\nexplanation it should be said that in the good old days among the\nSioux, a young man is not supposed to associate with girls until he\nis ready to take a wife.  It was a rule with our young men,\nespecially the honorable and well-born, to gain some reputation in\nthe hunt and in war, – the more difficult the feats achieved the\nbetter, – before even speaking to a young woman.  Many a life was\nrisked in the effort to establish a reputation along these lines. \nCourtship was no secret, but rather a social event, often\ncelebrated by the proud parents with feasts and presents to the\npoor, and this etiquette was sometimes felt by a shy or sensitive\nyouth as an insurmountable obstacle to the fulfilment of his\ndesires.",
        "Two Strike was the son and grandson of a chief, but he could\nnot claim any credit for the deeds of his forbears.  He had not\nonly to guard their good name but achieve one for himself.  This he\nhad set out to do, and he did well.  He was now of marriageable age\nwith a war record, and admitted to the council, yet he did not seem\nto trouble himself at all about a wife.  His was strictly a\nbachelor career.  Meanwhile, as is apt to be the case, his parents\nhad thought much about a possible daughter-in-law, and had even\ncollected ponies, fine robes, and other acceptable goods to be\ngiven away in honor of the event, whenever it should take place.  \nNow and then they would drop a sly hint, but with no perceptible\neffect.",
        "They did not and could not know of the inward struggle that\nracked his mind at this period of his life.  The shy and modest\nyoung man was dying for a wife, yet could not bear even to think of\nspeaking to a young woman!  The fearless hunter of buffaloes,\nmountain lions, and grizzlies, the youth who had won his eagle\nfeathers in a battle with the Utes, could not bring himself to take\nthis tremendous step.",
        "At last his father appealed to him directly.  “My son,” he\ndeclared, “it is your duty to take unto yourself a wife, in order\nthat the honors won by your ancestors and by yourself may be handed\ndown in the direct line.  There are several eligible young women in\nour band whose parents have intimated a wish to have you for their\nson-in-law.”",
        "Two Strike made no reply, but he was greatly disturbed.  He\nhad no wish to have the old folks select his bride, for if the\ntruth were told, his choice was already made.  He had simply lacked\nthe courage to go a-courting!",
        "The next morning, after making an unusually careful toilet, he\ntook his best horse and rode to a point overlooking the path by\nwhich the girls went for water.  Here the young men were wont to\ntake their stand, and, if fortunate, intercept the girl of their\nheart for a brief but fateful interview.  Two Strike had determined\nto speak straight to the point, and as soon as he saw the pretty\nmaid he came forward boldly and placed himself in her way.  A long\nmoment passed.  She glanced up at him shyly but not without\nencouragement.  His teeth fairly chattered with fright, and he\ncould not say a word.  She looked again, noted his strange looks,\nand believed him suddenly taken ill.  He appeared to be suffering. \nAt last he feebly made signs for her to go on and leave him alone. \nThe maiden was sympathetic, but as she did not know what else to do\nshe obeyed his request.",
        "The poor youth was so ashamed of his cowardice that he\nafterward admitted his first thought was to take his own life.  He\nbelieved he had disgraced himself forever in the eyes of the only\ngirl he had ever loved.  However, he determined to conquer his\nweakness and win her, which he did.  The story came out many years\nafter and was told with much enjoyment by the old men.",
        "Two Strike was better known by his own people than by the\nwhites, for he was individually a terror in battle rather than a\nleader.  He achieved his honorable name in a skirmish with the Utes\nin Colorado.  The Sioux regarded these people as their bravest\nenemies, and the outcome of the fight was for some time uncertain. \nFirst the Sioux were forced to retreat and then their opponents,\nand at the latter point the horse of a certain Ute was shot under\nhim.  A friend came to his rescue and took him up behind him.  Our\nhero overtook them in flight, raised his war club, and knocked both\nmen off with one blow.",
        "He was a very old man when he died, only two or three years\nago, on the Rosebud reservation.",
