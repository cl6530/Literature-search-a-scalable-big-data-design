        "[Footnote A: Hegel’s Inaugural Address at Heidelberg.]",
        "Before entering upon a criticism of Browning’s theory, as represented in\nthe last chapter, it may be well to give a brief summary of it.",
        "The most interesting feature of Browning’s proof of his optimistic faith\nis his appeal from the intelligence to the moral consciousness. To show\ntheoretically that evil is merely phenomenal is, in his view, both\nimpossible and undesirable. It is impossible, because the human\nintellect is incapable of knowing anything as it really is, or of\npronouncing upon the ultimate nature of any phenomenon. It is\nundesirable, because a theoretical proof of the evanescence of evil\nwould itself give rise to the greatest of all evils. The best thing in\nthe world is moral character. Man exists in order to grow better, and\nthe world exists in order to help him. But moral growth is possible only\nthrough conflict against evil, or what seems to be evil; hence, to\ndisprove the existence of evil would be to take away the possibility of\nlearning goodness, to stultify all human effort, and to deprive the\nworld of its meaning.",
        "But, if an optimistic doctrine cannot be reached by way of speculative\nthought, if the intellect of man cannot see the good in things evil, his\nmoral consciousness guarantees that all is for the best, and that “the\ngood is all in all.” For, in distinguishing between good and evil, the\nmoral consciousness sets up an ideal over against the actual. It\nconceives of a scheme of goodness which is not realized in the world,\nand it condemns the world as it is. Man, as moral being, is so\nconstituted that he cannot but regard the evil in the world as something\nto be annulled. If he had only the power, there would be no pain, no\nsorrow, no weakness, no failure, no death. Is man, then, better than the\nPower which made the world and let woe gain entrance into it? No!\nanswers the poet; for man himself is part of that world and the product\nof that Power. The Power that made the world also made the moral\nconsciousness which condemns the world; if it is the source of the evil\nin the world, it is also the source of that love in man, which, by\nself-expenditure, seeks to remedy it. If the external world is merely an\nexpression of a remorseless Power, whence comes the love which is the\nprinciple of the moral life in man? The same Power brings the antidote\nas well as the bane. And, further, the bane exists for the sake of the\nantidote, the wrong for the sake of the remedy. The evil in the world is\nmeans to a higher good, and the only means possible; for it calls into\nactivity the divine element in man, and thereby contributes to its\nrealization in his character. It gives the necessary opportunity for the\nexercise of love.",
        "Hence, evil cannot be regarded as ultimately real. It is real only as a\nstage in growth, as means to an end; and the means necessarily perishes,\nor is absorbed in, the attainment of the end. It has no significance\nexcept by reference to that end. From this point of view, evil is the\nresistance which makes progress possible, the negative which gives\nmeaning to the positive, the darkness that makes day beautiful. This\nmust not, however, be taken to mean that evil is nothing. It is\nresistance; it is negative; it does oppose the good; although its\nopposition is finally overcome. If it did not, if evil were unreal,\nthere would be no possibility of calling forth the moral potency of man,\nand the moral life would be a figment. But these two conditions of the\nmoral life–on the one hand, that the evil of the world must be capable\nof being overcome and is there for the purpose of being overcome, and\nthat it is unreal except as a means to the good; and, on the other hand,\nthat evil must be actually opposed to the good, if the good is to have\nany meaning,–cannot, Browning thinks, be reconciled with each other. It\nis manifest that the intellect of man cannot, at the same time, regard\nevil as both real and unreal. It must assert the one and deny the other;\nor else we must regard its testimony as altogether untrustworthy. But\nthe first alternative is destructive of the moral consciousness. Moral\nlife is alike impossible whether we deny or assert the real existence of\nevil. The latter alternative stultifies knowledge, and leaves all the\ndeeper concerns of life–the existence of good and evil, the reality of\nthe distinction between them, the existence of God, the moral governance\nof the world, the destiny of man–in a state of absolute uncertainty. We\nmust reject the testimony either of the heart or of the head.",
        "Browning, as we have seen, unhesitatingly adopts the latter alternative.\nHe remains loyal to the deliverances of his moral consciousness and\naccepts as equally valid, beliefs which the intellect finds to be\nself-contradictory: holding that knowledge on such matters is\nimpossible. And he rejects this knowledge, not only because our thoughts\nare self-contradictory in themselves, but because the failure of a\nspeculative solution of these problems is necessary to morality. Clear,\nconvincing, demonstrative knowledge would destroy morality; and the fact\nthat the power to attain such knowledge has been withheld from us is to\nbe regarded rather as an indication of the beneficence of God, who has\nnot held even ignorance to be too great a price for man to pay for\ngoodness.",
        "Knowledge is not the fit atmosphere for morality. It is faith and not\nreason, hope and trust but not certainty, that lend vigour to the good\nlife. We may believe, and rejoice in the belief, that the absolute good\nis fulfilling itself in all things, and that even the miseries of life\nare really its refracted rays–the light that gains in splendour by\nbeing broken. But we must not, and, indeed, cannot ascend from faith to\nknowledge. The heart may trust, and must trust, if it faithfully listens\nto its own natural voice; but reason must not demonstrate. Ignorance on\nthe side of intellect, faith on the side of the emotions; distrust of\nknowledge, absolute confidence in love; such is the condition of man’s\nhighest welfare: it is only thus that the purpose of his life, and of\nthe world which is his instrument, can be achieved.",
        "No final estimate of the value of this theory of morals and religion can\nbe made, without examining its philosophical presuppositions. Nor is\nsuch an examination in any way unfair; for it is obvious that Browning\nexplicitly offers us a philosophical doctrine. He appeals to argument\nand not to artistic intuition; he offers a definite theory to which he\nclaims attention, not on account of any poetic beauty that may lie\nwithin it, but on the ground that it is a true exposition of the moral\nnature of man. Kant’s Metaphysic of Ethics is not more metaphysical in\nintention than the poet’s later utterances on the problems of morality.\nIn La Saisiaz, in Ferishtah’s Fancies, in the Parleyings, and,\nthough less explicitly, in Asolando, Fifine at the Fair, and Red\nCotton Nightcap Country, Browning definitely states, and endeavours to\ndemonstrate a theory of knowledge, a theory of the relation of knowledge\nto morality, and a theory of the nature of evil; and he discusses the\narguments for the immortality of the soul. In these poems his artistic\ninstinct avails him, not as in his earlier ones, for the discovery of\ntruth by way of intuition, but for the adornment of doctrines already\nderived from a metaphysical repository. His art is no longer free, no\nlonger its own end, but coerced into an alien service. It has become\nillustrative and argumentative, and in being made to subserve\nspeculative purposes, it has ceased to be creative. Browning has\nappealed to philosophy, and philosophy must try his cause.",
        "Such, then, is Browning’s theory; and I need make no further apology for\ndiscussing at some length the validity of the division which it involves\nbetween the intellectual and the moral life of man. Is it possible to\ncombine the weakness of man’s intelligence with the strength of his\nmoral and religious life, and to find in the former the condition of the\nlatter? Does human knowledge fail, as the poet considers it to fail? Is\nthe intelligence of man absolutely incapable of arriving at knowledge of\nthings as they are? If it does, if man cannot know the truth, can he\nattain goodness? These are the questions that must now be answered.",
        "It is one of the characteristics of recent thought that it distrusts its\nown activity: the ancient philosophical “Scepticism” has been revived\nand strengthened. Side by side with the sense of the triumphant progress\nof natural science, there is a conviction, shared even by scientific\ninvestigators themselves, as well as by religious teachers and by many\nstudents of philosophy, that our knowledge has only limited and relative\nvalue, and that it always stops short of the true nature of things. The\nreason of this general conviction lies in the fact that thought has\nbecome aware of its own activity; men realize more clearly than they did\nin former times that the apparent constitution of things depends\ndirectly on the character of the intelligence which apprehends them.",
        "This relativity of things to thought has, not unnaturally, suggested the\nidea that the objects of our knowledge are different from objects as\nthey are. “That the real nature of things is very different from what we\nmake of them, that thought and thing are divorced, that there is a\nfundamental antithesis between them,” is, as Hegel said, “the hinge on\nwhich modern philosophy turns.” Educated opinion in our day has lost its\nnaive trust in itself. “The natural belief of man, it is true, ever\ngives the lie” to the doctrine that we do not know things. “In common\nlife,” adds Hegel, “we reflect without particularly noting that this is\nthe process of arriving at the truth, and we think without hesitation\nand in the firm belief that thought coincides with things.\"[A] But, as\nsoon as attention is directed to the process of thinking, and to the way\nin which the process affects our consciousness of the object, it is at\nonce concluded that thought will never reach reality, that things are\nnot given to us as they are, but distorted by the medium of sense and\nour intelligence, through which they pass. The doctrine of the\nrelativity of knowledge is thus very generally regarded as equivalent to\nthe doctrine that there is no true knowledge whatsoever. We know only\nphenomena, or appearances; and it is these, and not veritable facts,\nthat we systematize into sciences. “We can arrange the appearances–the\nshadows of our cave–and that, for the practical purposes of the cave,\nis all that we require.\"[B] Not even “earth’s least atom” can ever be\nknown to us as it really is; it is for us, at the best,",
        "[Footnote A: Wallace’s Translation of Hegel’s Logic, p. 36.]",
        "[Footnote B: Caird’s Comte.]",
        "  “An atom with some certain properties\n  Known about, thought of as occasion needs.\"[C]",
        "[Footnote C: A Bean-Stripe.]",
        "In this general distrust of knowledge, however, there are, as might be\nexpected, many different degrees. Its origin in modern times was, no\ndoubt, the doctrine of Kant. “This divorce of thing and thought,” says\nHegel, “is mainly the work of the critical philosophy and runs counter\nto the conviction of all previous ages.” And the completeness of the\ndivorce corresponds, with tolerable accuracy, to the degree in which the\ncritical philosophy has been understood; for Kant’s writings, like those\nof all great thinkers, are capable of many interpretations, varying in\ndepth with the intelligence of the interpreters.",
        "The most common and general form of this view of the limitation of the\nhuman intelligence is that which places the objects of religious faith\nbeyond the reach of human knowledge. We find traces of it in much of the\npopular theology of our day. The great facts of religion are often\nspoken of as lying in an extra-natural sphere, beyond experience, into\nwhich men cannot enter by the native right of reason. It is asserted\nthat the finite cannot know the infinite, that the nature of God is\nunknowable–except by means of a supernatural interference, which gives\nto men a new power of spiritual discernment, and “reveals” to them\nthings which are “above reason,\" although not contrary to it. The\ntheologian often shields certain of his doctrines from criticism, on the\nground, as he contends, that there are facts which we must believe, but\nwhich it would be presumptuous for us to pretend to understand or to\ndemonstrate. They are the proper objects of “faith.”",
        "But this view of the weakness of the intelligence when applied to\nsupersensuous facts, is held along with an undisturbed conviction of the\nvalidity of our knowledge of ordinary objects. It is believed, in a\nword, that there are two kinds of realities,–natural and supernatural;\nand that the former is knowable and the latter not.",
        "It requires, however, no great degree of intellectual acumen to discover\nthat this denial of the validity of our knowledge of these matters\ninvolves its denial in all its applications. The ordinary knowledge of\nnatural objects, which we begin by regarding as valid, or, rather, whose\nvalidity is taken for granted without being questioned, depends upon our\nideas of these supersensible objects. In other words, those fundamental\ndifficulties which pious opinion discovers in the region of theology,\nand which, as is thought, fling the human intellect back upon itself\ninto a consciousness of frailty and finitude, are found to lurk beneath\nour ordinary knowledge. Whenever, for instance, we endeavour to know any\nobject, we find that we are led back along the line of its conditions to\nthat which unconditionally determines it. For we cannot find the reason\nfor a particular object in a particular object. We are driven back\nendlessly from one to another along the chain of causes; and we can\nneither discover the first link nor do without it. The first link must\nbe a cause of itself, and experience yields none such. Such a cause\nwould be the unconditioned, and the unconditioned we cannot know. The\nfinal result of thinking is thus to lead us to an unknown; and, in\nconsequence, all our seeming knowledge is seen to have no intelligible\nbasis, and, therefore, to be merely hypothetical. If we cannot know God,\nwe cannot know anything.",
        "This view is held by the Positivists, and the most popular English\nexponent of it is, perhaps, Mr. Herbert Spencer. Its characteristic is\nits repudition of both theology and metaphysics as pseudo-sciences, and\nits high esteem for science. That esteem is not disturbed by the\nconfession that “noumenal causes,\"–that is, the actual reality of\nthings,–are unknown; for we can still lay claim to valid knowledge of\nthe laws of phenomena. Having acknowledged that natural things as known\nare merely phenomena, positivism treats them in all respects as if they\nwere realities; and it rejoices in the triumphant progress of the\nnatural sciences as if it were a veritable growth of knowledge. It does\nnot take to heart the phenomenal nature of known objects. But, having\npaid its formal compliments to the doctrine of the relativity of all\nknowledge, it neglects it altogether.",
        "Those who understand Kant better carry his scepticism further, and they\ncomplete the divorce between man’s knowledge and reality. The process of\nknowing, they hold, instead of leading us towards facts, as it was so\nlong supposed to do, takes us away from them: i.e., if either\n“towards” or “away from” can have any meaning when applied to two realms\nwhich are absolutely severed from one another. Knowledge is always\nconcerned with the relations between things; with their likeness, or\nunlikeness, their laws, or connections; but these are universals, and\nthings are individuals. Science knows the laws of things, but not the\nthings; it reveals how one object affects another, how it is connected\nwith it; but what are the things themselves, which are connected, it\ndoes not know. The laws are mere forms of thought, “bloodless\ncategories,” and not facts. They may somehow be regarded as explaining\nfacts, but they must not be identified with the facts. Knowledge is the\nsphere of man’s thoughts, and is made up of ideas; real things are in\nanother sphere, which man’s thoughts cannot reach. We must distinguish\nmore clearly than has hitherto been done, between logic as the science\nof knowledge, and metaphysics as a science which pretends to reveal the\nreal nature of things. In a word, we can know thoughts or universals,\nbut not things or particular existences. “When existence is in question\nit is the individual, not the universal, that is real; and the real\nindividual is not a composite of species and accidents, but is\nindividual to the inmost fibre of its being.” Each object keeps its own\nreal being to itself. Its inmost secret, its reality, is something that\ncannot appear in knowledge. We can only know its manifestations; but\nthese manifestations are not its reality, nor connected with it. These\nbelong to the sphere of knowledge, they are parts in a system of\nabstract thoughts; they do not exist in that system, or no-system, of\nindividual realities, each of which, in its veritable being, is itself\nonly, and connected with nought beside.",
        "Now, this view of the absolute impossibility of knowing any reality, on\naccount of the fundamental difference between things and our thoughts\nabout things, contains a better promise of a true view both of reality\nand of knowledge, than any of the previously mentioned half-hearted\ntheories. It forces us explicitly either to regard every effort to know\nas futile, or else to regard it as futile on this theory of it. In\nother words, we must either give up knowledge or else give up the\naccount of knowledge advanced by these philosophers. Hitherto, however,\nevery philosophy that has set itself against the possibility of the\nknowledge of reality has had to give way. It has failed to shake the\nfaith of mankind in its own intellectual endowment, or to arrest, even\nfor a moment, the attempt by thinking to know things as they are. The\nview held by Berkeley, that knowledge is merely subjective, because the\nessence of things consists in their being perceived by the individual,\nand that they are nothing but his ideas, was refuted by Kant, when he\nshowed that the very illusion of seeming knowledge was impossible on\nthat theory. And this later view, which represents knowledge as merely\nsubjective, on the ground that it is the product of the activity of the\nthought of mankind, working according to universal laws, is capable of\nbeing refuted in the same manner. The only difference between the\nBerkeleian and this modern speculative theory is that, on the former\nview, each individual constructed his own subjective entities or\nillusions; while, on the latter, all men, by reason of the universality\nof the laws of thought governing their minds, create the same illusion,\nthe same subjective scheme of ideas. Instead of each having his own\nprivate unreality, as the product of his perceiving activity, they have\nall the same, or at least a similar, phantom-world of ideas, as the\nresult of their thinking. But, in both cases alike, the reality of the\nworld without is out of reach, and knowledge is a purely subjective\napprehension of a world within. Thoughts are quite different from\nthings, and no effort of human reason can reveal any community between\nthem.",
        "Now, there are certain difficulties which, so far as I know, those who\nhold this view have scarcely attempted to meet. The first of these lies\nin the obvious fact, that all men at all times consider that this very\nprocess of thinking, which the theory condemns as futile, is the only\nway we have of finding out what the reality of things is. Why do we\nreflect and think, except in order to pass beyond the illusions of\nsensuous appearances to the knowledge of things as they are? Nay, why do\nthese philosophers themselves reflect, when reflection, instead of\nleading to truth, which is knowledge of reality, leads only to ideas,\nwhich, being universal, cannot represent the realities that are said to\nbe “individual.”",
        "The second is, that the knowledge of “the laws” of things gives to us\npractical command over them; although, according to this view, laws are\nnot things, nor any part of the reality of things, nor even true\nrepresentations of things. Our authority over things seems to grow pari\npassu with our knowledge. The natural sciences seem to prove by their\npractical efficiency, that they are not building up a world of\napparitions, like the real world; but gradually getting inside nature,\nlearning more and more to wield her powers, and to make them the\ninstruments of the purposes of man, and the means of his welfare. To\ncommon-sense,–which frequently “divines” truths that it cannot prove,\nand, like ballast in a ship, has often given steadiness to human\nprogress although it is only a dead weight,–the assertion that man\nknows nothing is as incredible as that he knows all things. If it is\nreplied, that the “things” which we seem to dominate by the means of\nknowledge are themselves only phenomena, the question arises, what then\nare the real things to which they are opposed? What right has any\nphilosophy to say that there is any reality which no one can in any\nsense know? The knowledge that such reality is, is surely a relation\nbetween that reality and consciousness, and, if so, the assertion of an\nunknowable reality is self-contradictory. For the conception of it is\nthe conception of something that is, and at the same time is not, out of\nrelation to consciousness.",
        "To say what kind of thing reality is, is a still more remarkable feat,\nif reality is unknowable. Reality, being beyond knowledge, why is it\ncalled particular or individual, rather than universal? How is it known\nthat the true being of things is different from ideas? Surely both of\nthe terms must be regarded as known to some extent, if they are called\nlike or unlike, contrasted or compared, opposed or identified.",
        "But, lastly, this theory has to account for the fact that it constitutes\nwhat is not only unreal, but impossible, into the criterion of what is\nactual. If knowledge of reality is altogether different from human\nknowledge, how does it come to be its criterion? That knowledge is\ninadequate or imperfect can be known, only by contrasting it with its\nown proper ideal, whatever that may be. A criticism by reference to a\nforeign or irrelevant criterion, or the condemnation of a theory as\nimperfect because it does not realize an impossible end, is\nunreasonable. All true criticism of an object implies a reference to a\nmore perfect state of itself.",
        "We must, then, regard the knowledge of objects as they are, which is\nopposed to human knowledge, as, only a completer and fuller form of that\nknowledge; or else we must cease to contrast it with our human\nknowledge, as valid with invalid, true with phenomenal. Either knowledge\nof reality is complete knowledge, or else it is a chimera. And, in\neither case, the sharp distinction between the real and the phenomenal\nvanishes; and what remains, is not a reality outside of consciousness,\nor different from ideas, but a reality related to consciousness, or, in\nother words, a knowable reality. “The distinction of objects into\nphenomena and noumena, i.e., into things that for us exist, and things\nthat for us do not exist, is an Irish bull in philosophy,” said Heine.\nTo speak of reality as unknowable, or to speak of anything as\nunknowable, is to utter a direct self-contradiction; it is to negate in\nthe predicate what is asserted in the subject. It is a still more\nstrange perversion to erect this knowable emptiness into a criterion of\nknowledge, and to call the latter phenomenal by reference to it.",
        "These difficulties are so fundamental and so obvious, that the theory of\nthe phenomenal nature of human knowledge, which, being interpreted,\nmeans that we know nothing, could scarcely maintain its hold, were it\nnot confused with another fact of human experience, that is apparently\ninconsistent with the doctrine that man can know the truth. Side by side\nwith the faith of ordinary consciousness, that in order to know anything\nwe must think, or, in other words, that knowledge shows us what things\nreally are, there is a conviction, strengthened by constant experience,\nthat we never know things fully. Every investigation into the nature of\nan object soon brings us to an enigma, a something more we do not know.\nFailing to know this something more, we generally consider that we have\nfallen short of reaching the reality of the object. We recognize, as it\nhas been expressed, that we have been brought to a stand, and we\ntherefore conclude that we are also brought to the end. We arrive at\nwhat we do not know, and we pronounce that unknown to be unknowable;\nthat is, we regard it as something different in nature from what we do\nknow. So far as I can see, the attitude of ordinary thought in regard to\nthis matter might be fairly represented by saying, that it always begins\nby considering objects as capable of being known in their reality, or as\nthey are, and that experience always proves the attempt to know them as\nthey are to be a failure. The effort is continued although failure is\nthe result, and even although that failure be exaggerated and\nuniversalized into that despair of knowledge which we have described. We\nare thus confronted with what seems to be a contradiction; a trust and\ndistrust in knowledge. It can only be solved by doing full justice to\nboth of the conflicting elements; and then, if possible, by showing that\nthey are elements, and not the complete, concrete fact, except when held\ntogether.",
        "From one point of view, it is undeniable that in every object of\nperception, we come upon problems that we cannot solve. Science at its\nbest, and even when dealing with the simplest of things, is forced to\nstop short of its final secret. Even when it has discovered its law,\nthere is still apparently something over and above which science cannot\ngrasp, and which seems to give to the object its reality. All the\nnatural sciences concentrated on a bit of iron ore fail to exhaust the\ntruth in it: there is always a “beyond” in it, something still more\nfundamental which is not yet understood. And that something beyond, that\ninner essence, that point in which the laws meet and which the sciences\nfail to lift into knowledge, is regarded as just the reality of the\nthing. Thus the reality is supposed, at the close of every\ninvestigation, to lie outside of knowledge; and conversely, all that we\ndo know, seeing that it lacks this last element, seems to be only\napparent knowledge, or knowledge of phenomena.",
        "In this way the process of knowing seems always to stop short at the\ncritical moment, when the truth is just about to be reached. And those\nwho dwell on this aspect alone are apt to conclude that man’s intellect\nis touched with a kind of impotence, which makes it useless when it gets\nnear the reality. It is like a weapon that snaps at the hilt just when\nthe battle is hottest. For we seem to be able to know everything but the\nreality, and yet apart from the real essence all knowledge seems to be\nmerely apparent. Physical science penetrates through the outer\nappearances of things to their laws, analyzes them into forms of energy,\ncalculates their action and predicts their effects with certainty. Its\npractical power over the forces of nature is so great that it seems to\nhave got inside her secrets. And yet science will itself acknowledge\nthat in every simplest object there is an unknown. Its triumphant course\nof explaining seems to be always arrested at the threshold of reality.\nIt has no theory, scarcely an hypothesis, of the actual nature of\nthings, or of what that is in each object, which constitutes it a real\nexistence. Natural science, with a scarcely concealed sneer, hands over\nto the metaphysician all questions as to the real being of things; and\nitself makes the more modest pretension of showing how things behave,\nnot what they are; what effects follow the original noumenal causes, but\nnot the veritable nature of these causes. Nor can the metaphysician, in\nhis turn, do more than suggest a hypothesis as to the nature of the\nultimate reality in things. He cannot detect or demonstrate it in any\nparticular fact. In a word, every minutest object in the world baffles\nthe combined powers of all forms of human thought, and holds back its\nessence or true being from them. And as long as this true being, or\nreality is not known, the knowledge which we seem to have cannot be held\nas ultimately true, but is demonstrably a makeshift.",
        "Having made this confession, there seems to be no alternative but to\npostulate an utter discrepancy between human thought and real existence,\nor between human knowledge and truth, which is the correspondence of\nthing and thought. For, at no point is knowledge found to be in touch\nwith real being; it is everywhere demonstrably conditioned and relative,\nand inadequate to express the true reality of its objects. What remains,\nthen, except to regard human knowledge as completely untrustworthy, as\nmerely of phenomena? If we cannot know any reality, does not knowledge\ncompletely fail?",
        "Now, in dealing with the moral life of man, we saw that the method of\nhard alternatives is invalid. The moral life, being progressive, was\nshown to be the meeting–point of the ideal and the actual; and the\nideal of perfect goodness was regarded as manifesting itself in actions\nwhich, nevertheless, were never adequate to express it. The good when\nachieved was ever condemned as unworthy, and the ideal when attained\never pressed for more adequate expression in a better character. The\nideal was present as potency, as realizing itself, but it was never\ncompletely realized. The absolute good was never reached in the best\naction, and never completely missed in the worst.",
        "The same conflict of real and unreal was shown to be essential to every\nnatural life. As long as anything grows it neither completely attains,\nnor completely falls away from its ideal. The growing acorn is not an\noak tree, and yet it is not a mere acorn. The child is not the man; and\nyet the man is in the child, and only needs to be evolved by interaction\nwith circumstances. The process of growth is one wherein the ideal is\nalways present, as a reconstructive power gradually changing its whole\nvehicle, or organism, into a more perfect expression of itself. The\nideal is reached in the end, just because it is present in the\nbeginning; and there is no end as long as growth continues.",
        "Now, it is evident that knowledge, whether it be that of the individual\nman or of the human race, is a thing that grows. The process by means of\nwhich natural science makes progress, or by which the consciousness of\nthe child expands and deepens into the consciousness of the man, is best\nmade intelligible from the point of view of evolution. It is like an\norganic process, in which each new acquirement finds its place in an old\norder, each new fact is brought under the permanent principles of\nexperience, and absorbed into an intellectual life, which itself, in\nturn, grows richer and fuller with every new acquisition. No knowledge\nworthy of the name is an aggregation of facts. Wisdom comes by growth.",
        "Hence, the assertion that knowledge never attains reality, does not\nimply that it always misses it. In morals we do not say that a man is\nentirely evil, although he never, even in his best actions, attains the\ntrue good. And if the process of knowing is one that presses onward\ntowards an ideal, that ideal is never completely missed even in the\npoorest knowledge. If it grows, the method of fixed alternatives must be\ninapplicable to it. The ideal, whatever it may be, must be considered as\nactive in the present, guiding the whole movement, and gradually\nmanifesting itself in each of the passing forms, which are used up as\nthe raw material of new acquirement; and yet no passing form completely\nexpresses the ideal.",
        "Nor is it difficult to say what that ideal of knowledge is, although we\ncannot define it in any adequate manner. We know that the end of\nmorality is the summum bonum, although we cannot, as long as we are\nprogressive, define its whole content, or find it fully realized in any\naction. Every failure brings new truth, every higher grade of moral\ncharacter reveals some new height of goodness to be scaled; the moral\nideal acquires definiteness and content as humanity moves upwards. And\nyet the ideal is not entirely unknown even at the first; even to the\nmost ignorant, it presents itself as a criterion which enables him to\ndistinguish between right and wrong, evil and goodness, and which guides\nhis practical life. The same truth holds with regard to knowledge. Its\ngrowth receives its impulse from, and is directed and determined by,\nwhat is conceived as the real world of facts. This truth, namely, that\nthe ideal knowledge is knowledge of reality, the most subjective\nphilosopher cannot but acknowledge. It is implied in his condemnation of\nknowledge as merely phenomenal, that there is possible a knowledge of\nreal being. That thought and reality can be brought together, or rather,\nthat they are always together, is presupposed in all knowledge and in\nall experience. The effort to know is the effort to explain the\nrelation of thought and reality, not to create it. The ideal of perfect\nknowledge is present from the first; it generates the effort, directs\nit, distinguishes between truth and error. And that which man ever aims\nat, whether in the ordinary activities of daily thought, or through the\npatient labour of scientific investigation, or in the reflective\nself-torture of philosophic thought, is to know the world as it is. No\nfailure damps the ardour of this endeavour. Relativists, phenomenalists,\nagnostics, sceptics, Kantians or Neo-Kantians–all the crowd of thinkers\nwho cry down the human intellect, and draw a charmed circle around\nreality so as to make it unapproachable to the mind of man–ply this\nuseless labour. They are seeking to penetrate beneath the shows of sense\nand the outer husk of phenomena to the truth, which is the meeting-point\nof knowledge and reality; they are endeavouring to translate into an\nintellectual possession the powers that play within and around them; or,\nin other words, to make these powers express themselves in their\nthoughts, and supply the content of their spiritual life. The irony,\nlatent in their endeavour, gives them no pause; they are in some way\ncontent to pursue what they call phantoms, and to try to satisfy their\nthirst with the waters of a mirage. This comes from the presence of the\nideal within them, that is, of the implicit unity of reality and\nthought, which seeks for explicit and complete manifestation in\nknowledge. The reality is present in them as thinking activity, working\ntowards complete revelation of itself by means of knowledge. And its\npresence is real, although the process is never complete.",
        "In knowledge, as in morals, it is necessary to remember both of the\ntruths implied in the pursuit of an ideal–that a growing thing not only\nalways fails to attain, but also always succeeds. The distinction\nbetween truth and error in knowledge is present at every stage in the\neffort to attain truth, as the distinction between right and wrong is\npresent in every phase of the moral life. It is the source of the\nintellectual effort. But that distinction cannot be drawn except by\nreference to a criterion of truth, which condemns our actual knowledge;\nas it is the absolute good, which condemns the present character. The\nideal may be indefinite, and its content confused and poor; but it is\nalways sufficient for its purpose, always better than the actual\nachievement. And, in this sense, reality, the truth, the veritable being\nof things, is always reached by the poorest knowledge. As there is no\nstarved and distorted sapling which is not the embodiment of the\nprinciple of natural life, so the meanest character is the product of an\nideal of goodness, and the most confused opinion of ignorant mankind is\nan expression of the reality of things. Without it there would not be\neven the semblance of knowledge, not even error and untruth.",
        "Those who, like Browning, make a division between man’s thought and real\nthings, and regard the sphere of knowledge as touching at no point the\nsphere of actual existence, are attributing to the bare human intellect\nmuch more power than it has. They regard mind as creating its phenomenal\nknowledge, or the apparent world. For, having separated mind from\nreality, it is evident that they cannot avail themselves of any doctrine\nof sensations or impressions as a medium between them, or postulate any\nother form of connection or means of communication. Connection of any\nkind must, in the end, imply some community of nature, and must put the\nunity of thought and being–here denied–beneath their difference.\nHence, the world of phenomena which we know, and which as known, does\nnot seem to consist of realities, must be the product of the unaided\nhuman mind. The intellect, isolated from all real being, has\nmanufactured the apparent universe, in all its endless wealth. It is a\ncreative intellect, although it can only create illusions. It evolves\nall its products from itself.",
        "But thought, set to revolve upon its own axis in an empty region, can\nproduce nothing, not even illusions. And, indeed, those who deny that it\nis possible for thought and reality to meet in a unity, have,\nnotwithstanding, to bring over “something” to the aid of thought. There\nmust be some effluence from the world of reality, some manifestations of\nthe thing (though they are not the reality of the thing, nor any part of\nthe reality, nor connected with the reality!) to assist the mind and\nsupply it with data. The “phenomenal world” is a hybrid, generated by\nthought and “something\"–which yet is not reality; for the real world is\na world of things in themselves, altogether beyond thought. By bringing\nin these data, it is virtually admitted that the human mind reaches down\ninto itself in vain for a world, even for a phenomenal one.",
        "Thought apart from things is quite empty, just as things apart from\nthought are blind. Such thought and such reality are mere abstractions,\nhypostasized by false metaphysics; they are elements of truth rent\nasunder, and destroyed in the rending. The dependence of the\nintelligence of man upon reality is direct and complete. The foolishest\ndream, that ever played out its panorama beneath a night-cap, came\nthrough the gates of the senses from the actual world. Man is limited to\nhis material in all that he knows, just as he is ruled by the laws of\nthought. He cannot go one step beyond it. To transcend “experience” is\nimpossible. We have no wings to sustain us in an empty region, and no\nneed of any. It is as impossible for man to create new ideas, as it is\nfor him to create new atoms. Our thought is essentially connected with\nreality. There is no mauvais pas from thought to things. We do not\nneed to leap out of ourselves in order to get into the world. We are in\nit from the first, both as physical and moral agents, and as thinking\nbeings. Our thoughts are expressions of the real nature of things, so\nfar as they go. They may be and are imperfect; they may be and are\nconfused and inadequate, and express only the superficial aspects and\nnot “the inmost fibres\"; still, they are what they are, in virtue of\n“the reality,” which finds itself interpreted in them. Severed from that\nreality, they would be nothing.",
        "Thus, the distinction between thought and reality is a distinction\nwithin a deeper unity. And that unity must not be regarded as something\nadditional to both, or as a third something. It is their unity. It is\nboth reality and thought: it is existing thought, or reality knowing\nitself and existing through its knowledge of self; it is\nself-consciousness. The distinguished elements have no existence or\nmeaning except in their unity. Like the actual and ideal, they have\nsignificance and being, only in their reference to each other.",
        "There is one more difficulty connected with this matter which I must\ntouch upon, although the discussion may already be regarded as prolix.\nIt is acknowledged by every one that the knowledge of the individual,\nand his apparent world of realities, grow pari passu. Beyond his\nsphere of knowledge there is no reality for him, not even apparent\nreality. But, on the other hand, the real world of existing things\nexists all the same whether he knows it or not. It did not begin to be\nwith any knowledge he may have of it, it does not cease to be with his\nextinction, and it is not in any way affected by his valid, or invalid,\nreconstruction of it in thought. The world which depends on his thought\nis his world, and not the world of really existing things. And this is\ntrue alike of every individual. The world is independent of all human\nminds. It existed before them, and will, very possibly, exist after\nthem. Can we not, therefore, conclude that the real world is independent\nof thought, and that it exists without relation to it?",
        "A short reference to the moral consciousness may suggest the answer to\nthis difficulty. In morality (as also is the case in knowledge) the\nmoral ideal, or the objective law of goodness, grows in richness and\nfulness of content with the individual who apprehends it. His moral\nworld is the counterpart of his moral growth as a character. Goodness\nfor him directly depends upon his recognition of it. Animals,\npresumably, have no moral ideal, because they have not the power to\nconstitute it. In morals, as in knowledge, the mind of man constructs\nits own world. And yet, in both alike, the world of truth or of goodness\nexists all the same whether the individual knows it or not. He does not\ncall the moral law into being, but finds it without, and then realizes\nit in his own life. The moral law does not vanish and reappear with its\nrecognition by mankind. It is not subject to the chances and changes of\nits life, but a good in itself that is eternal.",
        "Is it therefore independent of all intelligence? Can goodness be\nanything but the law of a self-conscious being? Is it the quality or\nmotive or ideal of a mere thing? Manifestly not. Its relation to\nself-consciousness is essential. With the extinction of\nself-consciousness all moral goodness is extinguished.",
        "The same holds true of reality. The question of the reality or unreality\nof things cannot arise except in an intelligence. Animals have neither\nillusions nor truths–unless they are self-conscious. The reality, which\nman sets over against his own inadequate knowledge, is posited by him;\nand it has no meaning whatsoever except in this contrast. And to\nendeavour to conceive a reality which no one knows, is to assert a\nrelative term without its correlative, which is absurd; it is to posit\nan ideal which is opposed to nothing actual.",
        "In this view, so commonly held in our day, that knowledge is subjective\nand reality unknowable, we have another example of the falseness and\ninconsistency of abstract thinking. If this error be committed, there is\nno fundamental gain in saying with Kant, that things are relative to the\nthought of all, instead of asserting, with Berkeley or Browning, that\nthey are relative to the thought of each. The final result is the same.\nThings as known, are reduced into mere creations of thought; things as\nthey are, are regarded as not thoughts, and as partaking in no way of\nthe nature of thought. And yet “reality” is virtually assumed to be\ngiven at the beginning of knowledge; for the sensations are supposed to\nbe emanations from it, or roused in consciousness by it. These\nsensations, it is said, man does not make, but receives, and receives\nfrom the concealed reality. They flow from it, and are the\nmanifestations of its activity. Then, in the next moment, reality is\nregarded as not given in any way, but as something to be discovered by\nthe effort of thought; for we always strive to know things, and not\nphantoms. Lastly, the knowledge thus acquired being regarded as\nimperfect, and experience showing to us continually that every object\nhas more in it than we know, the reality is pronounced to be unknowable,\nand all knowledge is regarded as failure, as acquaintance with mere\nphantoms. Thus, in thought, as in morality, the ideal is present at the\nbeginning, it is an effort after explicit realization, and its process\nis never complete.",
        "Now, all these aspects of the ideal of knowledge, that is, of reality,\nare held by the unsophisticated intelligence of man; and abstract\nphilosophy is not capable of finally getting rid of any one of them. It,\ntoo, holds them alternately. Its denial of the possibility of knowing\nreality is refuted by its own starting-point; for it begins with a given\nsomething, regarded as real, and its very effort to know is an attempt\nto know that reality by thinking. But it forgets these facts, when it is\ndiscovered that knowledge at the best is incomplete. It is thus tossed\nfrom assertion to denial, and from denial to assertion; from one\nabstract or one-sided view of reality, to the other.",
        "When these different aspects of truth are grasped together from the\npoint of view of evolution, there seems to be a way of escaping the\ndifficulties to which they give rise. For the ideal must be present at\nthe beginning, and cannot be present in its fulness till the process is\ncomplete. What is here required is to lift our theory of man’s knowledge\nto the level of our theory of his moral life, and to treat it frankly as\nthe process whereby reality manifests itself in the mind of man. In that\nway, we shall avoid the absurdities of both of the abstract schools of\nphilosophy, to both of which alike the native intelligence of man gives\nthe lie. We shall say neither that man knows nothing, nor that he knows\nall; we shall regard his knowledge, neither as purely phenomenal and out\nof all contact with reality, nor as an actual identification with the\nreal being of things in all their complex variety. For, in morality, we\ndo not say either that the individual is absolutely evil, because his\nactions never realize the supreme ideal of goodness; nor, that he is at\nthe last term of development, and “taking the place of God,” because he\nlives as “ever in his great Taskmaster’s eye.” Just as every moral\naction, however good, leaves something still to be desiderated,\nsomething that may become a stepping-stone for new movement towards the\nideal which it has failed to actualize; so all our knowledge of an\nobject leaves something over that we have not apprehended, which is\ntruer and more real than anything we know, and which in all future\neffort we strive to master. And, just as the very effort, to be good\nderives its impulse and direction from the ideal of goodness which is\npresent, and striving for realization; so the effort to know derives its\nimpulse and direction from the reality which is present, and striving\nfor complete realization in the thought of man. We know reality\nconfusedly from the first; and it is because we have attained so much\nknowledge, that we strive for greater clearness and fulness. It is by\nplanting his foot on the world that man travels. It is by opposing his\npower to the given reality that his knowledge grows.",
        "When once we recognize that reality is the ideal of knowledge, we are\nable to acknowledge all the truth that is in the doctrine of the\nphenomenalists, without falling into their errors and contradictions. We\nmay go as far as the poet in confessing intellectual impotence, and\nroundly call the knowledge of man “lacquered ignorance.” “Earth’s least\natom” does veritably remain an enigma. Man is actually flung back into\nhis circumscribed sphere by every fact; and he will continue to be so\nflung to the end of time. He will never know reality, nor be able to\nhold up in his hand the very heart of the simplest thing in the world.\nFor the world is an organic totality, and its simplest thing will not be\nseen, through and through, till everything is known, till every fact and\nevent is related to every other under principles which are universal:\njust as goodness cannot be fully achieved in any act, till the agent is\nin all ways lifted to the level of absolute goodness. Physics cannot\nreveal the forces which keep a stone in its place on the earth, till it\nhas traced the forces that maintain the starry systems in their course.\nNo fact can be thoroughly known, i.e., known in its reality, till the\nlight of the universe has been focussed upon it: and, on the other hand,\nto know any subject through and through would be to explain all being.\nThe highest law and the essence of the simple fact, the universal and\nthe particular, can only be known together, in and through one another.\n“Reality” in “the least atom” will be known, only when knowledge has\ncompleted its work, and the universe has become a transparent sphere,\npenetrated in every direction by the shafts of intelligence.",
        "But this is only half the truth. If knowledge is never complete, it is\nalways completing; if reality is never known, it is ever being\nknown; if the ideal is never actual, it is always being actualized.\nThe complete failure of knowledge is as impossible as its complete\nsuccess. It is at no time severed from reality; it is never its mere\nadumbration, nor are its contents mere phenomena. On the contrary, it is\nreality partially revealed, the ideal incompletely actualized. Our very\nerrors are the working of reality within us, and apart from it they\nwould be impossible. The process towards truth by man is the process of\ntruth in man; the movement of knowledge towards reality is the movement\nof reality into knowledge. A purely subjective consciousness which knows,\nsuch as the poet tried to describe, is a self-contradiction: it would be\na consciousness at once related, and not related, to the actual world.\nBut man has no need to relate himself to the world. He is already\nrelated, and his task is to understand that relation, or, in other words,\nto make both its terms intelligible. Man has no need to go out from\nhimself to facts; his relation to facts is prior to his distinction from\nthem. The truth is that he cannot entirely lift himself away from them,\nnor suspend his thoughts in the void. In his inmost being he is\ncreation’s voice, and in his knowledge he confusedly murmurs its deep\nthoughts.",
        "Browning was aware of this truth in its application to man’s moral\nnature. In speaking of the principle of love, he was not tempted to\napply fixed alternatives. On the contrary, he detected in the “poorest\nlove that was ever offered” the veritable presence of that which is\nperfect and complete, though never completely actualized. His interest\nin the moral development of man, and his penetrative moral insight,\nacting upon, and guided by the truths of the Christian religion, warned\nhim, on this side, against the absolute separation of the ideal and\nactual, the divine and human. Human love, however poor in quality and\nlimited in range, was to him God’s love in man. It was a wave breaking\nin the individual of that First Love, which is ever flowing back through\nthe life of humanity to its primal source. To him all moral endeavour is\nthe process of this Primal Love; and every man, as he consciously\nidentifies himself with it, may use the language of Scripture, and say,\n“It is not I that live, but Christ lives in me.”",
        "But, on the side of knowledge, he was neither so deeply interested, nor\nhad he so good a guide to lean upon. Ignorant, according to all\nappearances, of the philosophy which has made the Christian maxim, “Die\nto live,\"–which primarily is only a principle of morality–the basis of\nits theory of knowledge, he exaggerated the failure of science to reach\nthe whole truth as to any particular object, into a qualitative\ndiscrepancy between knowledge and truth. Because knowledge is never\ncomplete, it is always mere lacquered ignorance; and man’s apparent\nintellectual victories are only conquests in a land of unrealities, or\nmere phenomena. He occupies in regard to knowledge, a position strictly\nanalogous to that of Carlyle, in regard to morality; his intellectual\npessimism is the counterpart of the moral pessimism of his predecessor,\nand it springs from the same error. He forgot that the ideal without is\nalso the power within, which makes for its own manifestation in the mind\nof man.",
        "He opposed the intellect to the world, as Carlyle opposed the weakness\nof man to the law of duty; and he neglected the fact that the world was\nthere for him, only because he knew it, just as Carlyle neglected the\nfact that the duty was without, only because it was recognized within.\nHe strained the difference between the ideal and actual into an absolute\ndistinction; and, as Carlyle condemned man to strive for a goodness\nwhich he could never achieve, so Browning condemns him to pursue a truth\nwhich he can never attain. In both, the failure is regarded as absolute.\n“There is no good in us,” has for its counterpart “There is no truth in\nus.” Both the moralist and the poet dwell on the negative relation of\nthe ideal and actual, and forget that the negative has no meaning,\nexcept as the expression of a deeper affirmative. Carlyle had to learn\nthat we know our moral imperfection, only because we are conscious of a\nbetter within us; and Browning had to learn that we are aware of our\nignorance, only because we have the consciousness of fuller truth with\nwhich we contrast our knowledge. Browning, indeed, knew that the\nconsciousness of evil was itself evidence of the presence of good, that\nperfection means death, and progress is life, on the side of morals; but\nhe has missed the corresponding truth on the side of knowledge. If he\nacknowledges that the highest revealed itself to man, on the practical\nside, as love; he does not see that it has also manifested itself to\nman, on the theoretical side, as reason. The self-communication of the\nInfinite is incomplete love is a quality of God, intelligence a quality\nof man; hence, on one side, there is no limit to achievement, but on the\nother there is impotence. Human nature is absolutely divided against\nitself; and the division, as we have already seen, is not between flesh\nand spirit, but between a love which is God’s own and perfect, and an\nintelligence which is merely man’s and altogether weak and deceptive.",
        "This is what makes Browning think it impossible to re-establish faith in\nGod, except by turning his back on knowledge; but whether it is possible\nfor him to appeal to the moral consciousness, we shall inquire in the\nnext chapter.",
