        "When his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly, and\nwondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen.  The man was\nquite impassive, and waited for his orders.  Dorian lit a cigarette,\n[59] and walked over to the glass and glanced into it.  He could see\nthe reflection of Victor’s face perfectly.  It was like a placid mask\nof servility.  There was nothing to be afraid of, there.  Yet he\nthought it best to be on his guard.",
        "Speaking very slowly, he told him to tell the housekeeper that he\nwanted to see her, and then to go to the frame-maker’s and ask him to\nsend two of his men round at once.  It seemed to him that as the man\nleft the room he peered in the direction of the screen.  Or was that\nonly his fancy?",
        "After a few moments, Mrs. Leaf, a dear old lady in a black silk\ndress, with a photograph of the late Mr. Leaf framed in a large gold\nbrooch at her neck, and old-fashioned thread mittens on her wrinkled\nhands, bustled into the room.",
        "“Well, Master Dorian,” she said, “what can I do for you?  I beg your\npardon, sir,\"–here came a courtesy,–\"I shouldn’t call you Master\nDorian any more.  But, Lord bless you, sir, I have known you since\nyou were a baby, and many’s the trick you’ve played on poor old Leaf.\nNot that you were not always a good boy, sir; but boys will be boys,\nMaster Dorian, and jam is a temptation to the young, isn’t it, sir?”",
        "He laughed.  “You must always call me Master Dorian, Leaf.  I will be\nvery angry with you if you don’t.  And I assure you I am quite as\nfond of jam now as I used to be.  Only when I am asked out to tea I\nam never offered any.  I want you to give me the key of the room at\nthe top of the house.”",
        "“The old school-room, Master Dorian?  Why, it’s full of dust.  I must\nget it arranged and put straight before you go into it.  It’s not fit\nfor you to see, Master Dorian.  It is not, indeed.”",
        "“I don’t want it put straight, Leaf.  I only want the key.”",
        "“Well, Master Dorian, you’ll be covered with cobwebs if you goes into\nit.  Why, it hasn’t been opened for nearly five years,–not since his\nlordship died.”",
        "He winced at the mention of his dead uncle’s name.  He had hateful\nmemories of him.  “That does not matter, Leaf,” he replied.  “All I\nwant is the key.”",
        "“And here is the key, Master Dorian,” said the old lady, after going\nover the contents of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands.\n“Here is the key.  I’ll have it off the ring in a moment.  But you\ndon’t think of living up there, Master Dorian, and you so comfortable\nhere?”",
        "“No, Leaf, I don’t.  I merely want to see the place, and perhaps\nstore something in it,–that is all.  Thank you, Leaf.  I hope your\nrheumatism is better; and mind you send me up jam for breakfast.”",
        "Mrs. Leaf shook her head.  “Them foreigners doesn’t understand jam,\nMaster Dorian.  They calls it ’compot.’  But I’ll bring it to you\nmyself some morning, if you lets me.”",
        "“That will be very kind of you, Leaf,” he answered, looking at the\nkey; and, having made him an elaborate courtesy, the old lady left\nthe room, her face wreathed in smiles.  She had a strong objection to\nthe French valet.  It was a poor thing, she felt, for any one to be\nborn a foreigner.",
        "[60] As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket, and looked\nround the room.  His eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet\nheavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-\ncentury Venetian work that his uncle had found in a convent near\nBologna.  Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in.  It\nhad perhaps served often as a pall for the dead.  Now it was to hide\nsomething that had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption\nof death itself,–something that would breed horrors and yet would\nnever die.  What the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the\npainted image on the canvas.  They would mar its beauty, and eat away\nits grace.  They would defile it, and make it shameful.  And yet the\nthing would still live on.  It would be always alive.",
        "He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told\nBasil the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away.\nBasil would have helped him to resist Lord Henry’s influence, and the\nstill more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament.\nThe love that he bore him–for it was really love–had something\nnoble and intellectual in it.  It was not that mere physical\nadmiration of beauty that is born of the senses, and that dies when\nthe senses tire.  It was such love as Michael Angelo had known, and\nMontaigne, and Winckelmann, and Shakespeare himself.  Yes, Basil\ncould have saved him.  But it was too late now.  The past could\nalways be annihilated.  Regret, denial, or forgetfulness could do\nthat.  But the future was inevitable.  There were passions in him\nthat would find their terrible outlet, dreams that would make the\nshadow of their evil real.",
        "He took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that\ncovered it, and, holding it in his hands, passed behind the screen.\nWas the face on the canvas viler than before?  It seemed to him that\nit was unchanged; and yet his loathing of it was intensified.  Gold\nhair, blue eyes, and rose-red lips,–they all were there.  It was\nsimply the expression that had altered.  That was horrible in its\ncruelty.  Compared to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke, how\nshallow Basil’s reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!–how shallow,\nand of what little account!  His own soul was looking out at him from\nthe canvas and calling him to judgment.  A look of pain came across\nhim, and he flung the rich pall over the picture.  As he did so, a\nknock came to the door.  He passed out as his servant entered.",
        "“The persons are here, monsieur.”",
        "He felt that the man must be got rid of at once.  He must not be\nallowed to know where the picture was being taken to.  There was\nsomething sly about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes.\nSitting down at the writing-table, he scribbled a note to Lord Henry,\nasking him to send him round something to read, and reminding him\nthat they were to meet at eight-fifteen that evening.",
        "“Wait for an answer,” he said, handing it to him, “and show the men\nin here.”",
        "In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Ashton\nhimself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in\nwith a somewhat rough-looking young assistant.  Mr. Ashton was a\nflorid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was\nconsiderably [61] tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of\nthe artists who dealt with him.  As a rule, he never left his shop.\nHe waited for people to come to him.  But he always made an exception\nin favor of Dorian Gray.  There was something about Dorian that\ncharmed everybody.  It was a pleasure even to see him.",
        "“What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?” he said, rubbing his fat freckled\nhands.  “I thought I would do myself the honor of coming round in\nperson.  I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir.  Picked it up at a\nsale.  Old Florentine.  Came from Fonthill, I believe.  Admirably\nsuited for a religious picture, Mr. Gray.”",
        "“I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round,\nMr. Ashton.  I will certainly drop in and look at the frame,–though\nI don’t go in much for religious art,–but to-day I only want a\npicture carried to the top of the house for me.  It is rather heavy,\nso I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men.”",
        "“No trouble at all, Mr. Gray.  I am delighted to be of any service to\nyou.  Which is the work of art, sir?”",
        "“This,” replied Dorian, moving the screen back.  “Can you move it,\ncovering and all, just as it is?  I don’t want it to get scratched\ngoing up-stairs.”",
        "“There will be no difficulty, sir,” said the genial frame-maker,\nbeginning, with the aid of his assistant, to unhook the picture from\nthe long brass chains by which it was suspended.  “And, now, where\nshall we carry it to, Mr. Gray?”",
        "“I will show you the way, Mr. Ashton, if you will kindly follow me.\nOr perhaps you had better go in front.  I am afraid it is right at\nthe top of the house.  We will go up by the front staircase, as it is\nwider.”",
        "He held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall and\nbegan the ascent.  The elaborate character of the frame had made the\npicture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the obsequious\nprotests of Mr. Ashton, who had a true tradesman’s dislike of seeing\na gentleman doing anything useful, Dorian put his hand to it so as to\nhelp them.",
        "“Something of a load to carry, sir,” gasped the little man, when they\nreached the top landing.  And he wiped his shiny forehead.",
        "“A terrible load to carry,” murmured Dorian, as he unlocked the door\nthat opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious secret\nof his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men.",
        "He had not entered the place for more than four years,–not, indeed,\nsince he had used it first as a play-room when he was a child and\nthen as a study when he grew somewhat older.  It was a large, well-\nproportioned room, which had been specially built by the last Lord\nSherard for the use of the little nephew whom, being himself\nchildless, and perhaps for other reasons, he had always hated and\ndesired to keep at a distance.  It did not appear to Dorian to have\nmuch changed.  There was the huge Italian cassone, with its\nfantastically-painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in\nwhich he had so often hidden himself as a boy.  There was the\nsatinwood bookcase filled with his dog-eared school-books.  On the\nwall behind it was hanging the same [62] ragged Flemish tapestry\nwhere a faded king and queen were playing chess in a garden, while a\ncompany of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted\nwrists.  How well he recalled it all!  Every moment of his lonely\nchildhood came back to him, as he looked round.  He remembered the\nstainless purity of his boyish life, and it seemed horrible to him\nthat it was here that the fatal portrait was to be hidden away.  How\nlittle he had thought, in those dead days, of all that was in store\nfor him!",
        "But there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes\nas this.  He had the key, and no one else could enter it.  Beneath\nits purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial,\nsodden, and unclean.  What did it matter?  No one could see it.  He\nhimself would not see it.  Why should he watch the hideous corruption\nof his soul?  He kept his youth,–that was enough.  And, besides,\nmight not his nature grow finer, after all?  There was no reason that\nthe future should be so full of shame.  Some love might come across\nhis life, and purify him, and shield him from those sins that seemed\nto be already stirring in spirit and in flesh,–those curious\nunpictured sins whose very mystery lent them their subtlety and their\ncharm.  Perhaps, some day, the cruel look would have passed away from\nthe scarlet sensitive mouth, and he might show to the world Basil\nHallward’s masterpiece.",
        "No; that was impossible.  The thing upon the canvas was growing old,\nhour by hour, and week by week.  Even if it escaped the hideousness\nof sin, the hideousness of age was in store for it.  The cheeks would\nbecome hollow or flaccid.  Yellow crow’s-feet would creep round the\nfading eyes and make them horrible.  The hair would lose its\nbrightness, the mouth would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross,\nas the mouths of old men are.  There would be the wrinkled throat,\nthe cold blue-veined hands, the twisted body, that he remembered in\nthe uncle who had been so stern to him in his boyhood.  The picture\nhad to be concealed.  There was no help for it.",
        "“Bring it in, Mr. Ashton, please,” he said, wearily, turning round.\n“I am sorry I kept you so long.  I was thinking of something else.”",
        "“Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray,” answered the frame-maker, who\nwas still gasping for breath.  “Where shall we put it, sir?”",
        "“Oh, anywhere, Here, this will do.  I don’t want to have it hung up.\nJust lean it against the wall.  Thanks.”",
        "“Might one look at the work of art, sir?”",
        "Dorian started.  “It would not interest you, Mr. Ashton,” he said,\nkeeping his eye on the man.  He felt ready to leap upon him and fling\nhim to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that\nconcealed the secret of his life.  “I won’t trouble you any more now.\nI am much obliged for your kindness in coming round.”",
        "“Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray.  Ever ready to do anything for\nyou, sir.”  And Mr. Ashton tramped down-stairs, followed by the\nassistant, who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in\nhis rough, uncomely face.  He had never seen any one so marvellous.",
        "When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked [63]\nthe door, and put the key in his pocket.  He felt safe now.  No one\nwould ever look on the horrible thing.  No eye but his would ever see\nhis shame.",
        "On reaching the library he found that it was just after five o’clock,\nand that the tea had been already brought up.  On a little table of\ndark perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from his\nguardian’s wife, Lady Radley, who had spent the preceding winter in\nCairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside it was a book\nbound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the edges soiled.\nA copy of the third edition of the St. James’s Gazette had been\nplaced on the tea-tray.  It was evident that Victor had returned.  He\nwondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were leaving the\nhouse and had wormed out of them what they had been doing.  He would\nbe sure to miss the picture,–had no doubt missed it already, while\nhe had been laying the tea-things.  The screen had not been replaced,\nand the blank space on the wall was visible.  Perhaps some night he\nmight find him creeping up-stairs and trying to force the door of the\nroom.  It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one’s house.  He had\nheard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some\nservant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked\nup a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered\nflower or a bit of crumpled lace.",
        "He sighed, and, having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord\nHenry’s note.  It was simply to say that he sent him round the\nevening paper, and a book that might interest him, and that he would\nbe at the club at eight-fifteen.  He opened the St. James’s\nlanguidly, and looked through it.  A red pencil-mark on the fifth\npage caught his eye.  He read the following paragraph:",
        "“INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.–An inquest was held this morning at the Bell\nTavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the body\nof Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal Theatre,\nHolborn.  A verdict of death by misadventure was returned.\nConsiderable sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased,\nwho was greatly affected during the giving of her own evidence, and\nthat of Dr. Birrell, who had made the post-mortem examination of the\ndeceased.”",
        "He frowned slightly, and, tearing the paper in two, went across the\nroom and flung the pieces into a gilt basket.  How ugly it all was!\nAnd how horribly real ugliness made things!  He felt a little annoyed\nwith Lord Henry for having sent him the account.  And it was\ncertainly stupid of him to have marked it with red pencil.  Victor\nmight have read it.  The man knew more than enough English for that.",
        "Perhaps he had read it, and had begun to suspect something.  And,\nyet, what did it matter?  What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl\nVane’s death?  There was nothing to fear.  Dorian Gray had not killed\nher.",
        "His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him.  What\nwas it, he wondered.  He went towards the little pearl-colored\noctagonal stand, that had always looked to him like the work of some\n[64] strange Egyptian bees who wrought in silver, and took the volume\nup.  He flung himself into an arm-chair, and began to turn over the\nleaves.  After a few minutes, he became absorbed.  It was the\nstrangest book he had ever read.  It seemed to him that in exquisite\nraiment, and to the delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world\nwere passing in dumb show before him.  Things that he had dimly\ndreamed of were suddenly made real to him.  Things of which he had\nnever dreamed were gradually revealed.",
        "It was a novel without a plot, and with only one character, being,\nindeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian, who\nspent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the\npassions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except\nhis own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods\nthrough which the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their mere\nartificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called\nvirtue, as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call\nsin.  The style in which it was written was that curious jewelled\nstyle, vivid and obscure at once, full of argot and of archaisms, of\ntechnical expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that\ncharacterizes the work of some of the finest artists of the French\nschool of Décadents.  There were in it metaphors as monstrous as\norchids, and as evil in color.  The life of the senses was described\nin the terms of mystical philosophy.  One hardly knew at times\nwhether one was reading the spiritual ecstasies of some mediaeval\nsaint or the morbid confessions of a modern sinner.  It was a\npoisonous book.  The heavy odor of incense seemed to cling about its\npages and to trouble the brain.  The mere cadence of the sentences,\nthe subtle monotony of their music, so full as it was of complex\nrefrains and movements elaborately repeated, produced in the mind of\nthe lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter, a form of revery, a\nmalady of dreaming, that made him unconscious of the falling day and\nthe creeping shadows.",
        "Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky\ngleamed through the windows.  He read on by its wan light till he\ncould read no more.  Then, after his valet had reminded him several\ntimes of the lateness of the hour, he got up, and, going into the\nnext room, placed the book on the little Florentine table that always\nstood at his bedside, and began to dress for dinner.",
        "It was almost nine o’clock before he reached the club, where he found\nLord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very bored.",
        "“I am so sorry, Harry,” he cried, “but really it is entirely your\nfault.  That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot what the\ntime was.”",
        "“I thought you would like it,” replied his host, rising from his\nchair.",
        "“I didn’t say I liked it, Harry.  I said it fascinated me.  There is\na great difference.”",
        "“Ah, if you have discovered that, you have discovered a great deal,\"\nmurmured Lord Henry, with his curious smile.  “Come, let us go in to\ndinner.  It is dreadfully late, and I am afraid the champagne will be\ntoo much iced.”",
