        "\n   For my own part, I remember nothing of my flight\nexcept the stress of blundering against trees and stumbling\nthrough the heather.  All about me gathered the invisible\nterrors of the Martians; that pitiless sword of heat seemed\nwhirling to and fro, flourishing overhead before it descended\nand smote me out of life.  I came into the road between the\ncrossroads and Horsell, and ran along this to the crossroads.",
        "At last I could go no further; I was exhausted with the\nviolence of my emotion and of my flight, and I staggered and\nfell by the wayside.  That was near the bridge that crosses\nthe canal by the gasworks.  I fell and lay still.",
        "I must have remained there some time.",
        "I sat up, strangely perplexed.  For a moment, perhaps, I\ncould not clearly understand how I came there.  My terror\nhad fallen from me like a garment.  My hat had gone, and\nmy collar had burst away from its fastener.  A few minutes\nbefore, there had only been three real things before me--the\nimmensity of the night and space and nature, my own feeble-\nness and anguish, and the near approach of death.  Now it\nwas as if something turned over, and the point of view altered\nabruptly.  There was no sensible transition from one state of\nmind to the other.  I was immediately the self of every day\nagain--a decent, ordinary citizen.  The silent common, the\nimpulse of my flight, the starting flames, were as if they had\nbeen in a dream.  I asked myself had these latter things indeed\nhappened?  I could not credit it.",
        "I rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the\nbridge.  My mind was blank wonder.  My muscles and nerves\nseemed drained of their strength.  I dare say I staggered\ndrunkenly.  A head rose over the arch, and the figure of a\nworkman carrying a basket appeared.  Beside him ran a little\nboy.  He passed me, wishing me good night.  I was minded to\nspeak to him, but did not.  I answered his greeting with a\nmeaningless mumble and went on over the bridge.",
        "Over the Maybury arch a train, a billowing tumult of\nwhite, firelit smoke, and a long caterpillar of lighted windows,\nwent flying south--clatter, clatter, clap, rap, and it had gone.\nA dim group of people talked in the gate of one of the houses\nin the pretty little row of gables that was called Oriental\nTerrace.  It was all so real and so familiar.  And that behind\nme!  It was frantic, fantastic!  Such things, I told myself,\ncould not be.",
        "Perhaps I am a man of exceptional moods.  I do not know\nhow far my experience is common.  At times I suffer from the\nstrangest sense of detachment from myself and the world\nabout me; I seem to watch it all from the outside, from some-\nwhere inconceivably remote, out of time, out of space, out\nof the stress and tragedy of it all.  This feeling was very\nstrong upon me that night.  Here was another side to my\ndream.",
        "But the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity\nand the swift death flying yonder, not two miles away.  There\nwas a noise of business from the gasworks, and the electric\nlamps were all alight.  I stopped at the group of people.",
        "“What news from the common?” said I.",
        "There were two men and a woman at the gate.",
        "“Eh?” said one of the men, turning.",
        "“What news from the common?” I said.",
        "“’Ain’t yer just BEEN there?” asked the men.",
        "“People seem fair silly about the common,” said the woman\nover the gate.  “What’s it all abart?”",
        "“Haven’t you heard of the men from Mars?” said I; “the\ncreatures from Mars?”",
        "“Quite enough,” said the woman over the gate.  “Thenks\";\nand all three of them laughed.",
        "I felt foolish and angry.  I tried and found I could not tell\nthem what I had seen.  They laughed again at my broken\nsentences.",
        "“You’ll hear more yet,” I said, and went on to my home.",
        "I startled my wife at the doorway, so haggard was I.  I went\ninto the dining room, sat down, drank some wine, and so\nsoon as I could collect myself sufficiently I told her the things\nI had seen.  The dinner, which was a cold one, had already\nbeen served, and remained neglected on the table while I\ntold my story.",
        "“There is one thing,” I said, to allay the fears I had\naroused; “they are the most sluggish things I ever saw crawl.\nThey may keep the pit and kill people who come near them,\nbut they cannot get out of it. . . .  But the horror of them!”",
        "“Don’t, dear!” said my wife, knitting her brows and putting\nher hand on mine.",
        "“Poor Ogilvy!” I said.  “To think he may be lying dead\nthere!”",
        "My wife at least did not find my experience incredible.\nWhen I saw how deadly white her face was, I ceased abruptly.",
        "“They may come here,” she said again and again.",
        "I pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure her.",
        "“They can scarcely move,” I said.",
        "I began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that\nOgilvy had told me of the impossibility of the Martians estab-\nlishing themselves on the earth.  In particular I laid stress on\nthe gravitational difficulty.  On the surface of the earth the\nforce of gravity is three times what it is on the surface of\nMars.  A Martian, therefore, would weigh three times more\nthan on Mars, albeit his muscular strength would be the same.\nHis own body would be a cope of lead to him.  That, indeed,\nwas the general opinion.  Both THE TIMES and the DAILY\nTELEGRAPH, for instance, insisted on it the next morning, and\nboth overlooked, just as I did, two obvious modifying influ-\nences.",
        "The atmosphere of the earth, we now know, contains far\nmore oxygen or far less argon (whichever way one likes to\nput it) than does Mars.  The invigorating influences of this\nexcess of oxygen upon the Martians indisputably did much\nto counterbalance the increased weight of their bodies.  And,\nin the second place, we all overlooked the fact that such\nmechanical intelligence as the Martian possessed was quite\nable to dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch.",
        "But I did not consider these points at the time, and so my\nreasoning was dead against the chances of the invaders.\nWith wine and food, the confidence of my own table, and\nthe necessity of reassuring my wife, I grew by insensible\ndegrees courageous and secure.",
        "“They have done a foolish thing,” said I, fingering my\nwineglass.  “They are dangerous because, no doubt, they are\nmad with terror.  Perhaps they expected to find no living\nthings--certainly no intelligent living things.",
        "“A shell in the pit” said I, “if the worst comes to the worst\nwill kill them all.”",
        "The intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my\nperceptive powers in a state of erethism.  I remember that\ndinner table with extraordinary vividness even now.  My dear\nwife’s sweet anxious face peering at me from under the pink\nlamp shade, the white cloth with its silver and glass table\nfurniture--for in those days even philosophical writers had\nmany little luxuries--the crimson-purple wine in my glass,\nare photographically distinct.  At the end of it I sat, temper-\ning nuts with a cigarette, regretting Ogilvy’s rashness, and\ndenouncing the shortsighted timidity of the Martians.",
        "So some respectable dodo in the Mauritius might have\nlorded it in his nest, and discussed the arrival of that shipful\nof pitiless sailors in want of animal food.  “We will peck them\nto death tomorrow, my dear.”",
        "I did not know it, but that was the last civilised dinner\nI was to eat for very many strange and terrible days.",
