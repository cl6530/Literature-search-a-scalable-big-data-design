        "On the morning of the 3d the battle was renewed, but the enemy seemed\nto have expended his energy in the assault of the previous night, and\nthe firing along the lines was desultory until stopped by my sending\nthe following letter within the Spanish lines:",
        "“Headquarters U. S. Forces, near San Juan River,\n“July 3, 1898–8:30 a. m.",
        "“Sir,–I shall be obliged, unless you surrender, to shell Santiago de\nCuba. Please inform the citizens of foreign countries, and all the\nwomen and children, that they should leave the city before 10 o’clock\nto-morrow morning.",
        "“Very respectfully, your obedient servant,",
        "“William R. Shafter,\n“Maj.-Gen. U. S. Vols.\n“The Commanding General of the Spanish Forces, Santiago de Cuba.”",
        "To this letter I received the following reply:",
        "“Santiago de Cuba, July 3, 1898.",
        "“His Excellency the General Commanding Forces of the United States,\nnear San Juan River:",
        "“Sir,–I have the honor to reply to your communication of to-day,\nwritten at 8:30 a. m. and received at 1 p. m., demanding the surrender\nof this city, or, in the contrary case, announcing to me that you will\nbombard this city, and that I advise the foreigners, women and\nchildren, that they must leave the city before 10 o’clock to-morrow\nmorning.",
        "“It is my duty to say to you that this city will not surrender, and\nthat I will inform the foreign consuls and inhabitants of the contents\nof your message.",
        "“Very respectfully, Jose Toral,\n“Commander-in-Chief 4th Corps.”",
        "Several of the foreign consuls came into my lines and asked that the\ntime given for them–the women and children–to depart from the city\nbe extended until 10 o’clock on July 5th. This induced me to write a\nsecond letter, as follows:",
        "“Santiago de Cuba, July 3d, 1898.",
        "“Sir,–In consideration of a request of the consular officers in your\ncity for further delay in carrying out my intentions to fire on the\ncity, and in the interests of the poor women and children who will\nsuffer very greatly by their hasty and enforced departure from the\ncity, I have the honor to announce that I will delay such action,\nsolely in their interests, until noon of the 5th, provided that during\nthe interim your forces make no demonstration whatever upon those of\nmy own.",
        "“I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,",
        "“William R Shafter,\n“Maj.-Gen. U. S. A.\n“The Commanding General, Spanish Forces.”",
        "My first message went under a flag of truce at 12:42 p.m. I was of the\nopinion that the Spaniards would surrender if given a little time, and\nI thought this result would be hastened if the men of their army could\nbe made to understand they would be well treated as prisoners of war.\nActing upon this presumption, I determined to offer to return all the\nwounded Spanish officers at El Caney who were able to bear\ntransportation, and who were willing to give their paroles not to\nserve against the forces of the United States until regularly\nexchanged. This offer was made and accepted. These officers, as well\nas several of the wounded Spanish privates, twenty-seven in all, were\nsent to their lines under the escort of some of our mounted cavalry.\nOur troops were received with honors, and I have every reason to\nbelieve the return of the Spanish prisoners produced a good impression\non their comrades.",
