        "Can you be taught how to write for vaudeville?  If you have the\nnative gift, what experienced writers say about its problems, what\nthey themselves have accomplished, and the means by which it has\nbeen wrought, will be of help to you.  So much this book offers,\nand more I would not claim for it.",
        "Although this volume is the first treatise on the subject of which\nI know, it is less an original offering than a compilation.  Growing\nout of a series of articles written in collaboration with Mr.\nWilliam C. Lengel for The Green Book Magazine, the subject assumed\nsuch bigness in my eyes that when I began the writing of this book,\nI spent months harvesting the knowledge of others to add to my own\nexperience.  With the warm-heartedness for which vaudevillians are\nfamous, nearly everyone whose aid I asked lent assistance gladly.\n\"It is vaudeville’s first book,” said more than one, deprecating\nthe value of his own suggestions, “and we want it right in each\nslightest particular.”",
        "To the following kindly gentlemen I wish to express my especial\nthanks:  Aaron Hoffman, Edwin Hopkins, James Madison, Edgar Allan\nWoolf, Richard Harding Davis–the foremost example of a writer who\nmade a famous name first in literature and afterward in\nvaudeville–Arthur Hopkins, Taylor Granville, Junie McCree, Arthur\nDenvir, Frank Fogarty, Irving Berlin, Charles K. Harris, L. Wolfe\nGilbert, Ballard MacDonald, Louis Bernstein, Joe McCarthy, Joseph\nHart, Joseph Maxwell, George A. Gottlieb, Daniel F. Hennessy,\nSime Silverman, Thomas J. Gray, William C. Lengel, Miss Nellie\nRevell, the “big sister of vaudeville,” and a host of others whose\nnames space does not permit my naming again here, but whose work\nis evidenced in the following pages.  To Alexander Black, the man\nwho made the first picture play twenty-one years ago, I owe thanks\nfor points in the discussion of dramatic values.  And for many\nhelpful suggestions, and his kindly editing, I wish to express my\ngratitude to Dr. J. Berg Esenwein.  To these “friends indeed\"\nbelongs whatever merit this book possesses.",

        "It falls to the lot of few men in these days to blaze a new trail\nin Bookland.  This Mr. Brett Page has done, with firmness and\nprecision, and with a joy in every stroke that will beget in\ncountless readers that answering joy which is the reward of both\nhim who guides and him who follows.  There is but one word for a\nwork so penetrating, so eductive, so clear–and that word is\nmasterly.  Let no one believe the modest assertion that “Writing\nfor Vaudeville” is “less an original offering than a compilation.\"\nI have seen it grow and re-grow, section by section, and never\nhave I known an author give more care to the development of his\ntheme in an original way.  Mr. Page has worked with fidelity to\nthe convictions gained while himself writing professionally, yet\nwith deference for the opinions of past masters in this field.\nThe result is a book quite unexcelled among manuals of instruction,\nfor authority, full statement, analysis of the sort that leads the\nreader to see what essentials he must build into his own structures,\nand sympathetic helpfulness throughout.  I count it an honor to\nhave been the editorial sponsor for a pioneer book which will be\nsoon known everywhere.",
        "J. BERG ESENWEIN",
        "A French workman who lived in the Valley of the Vire in the\nfourteenth or fifteenth century, is said to be vaudeville’s\ngrandparent.  Of course, the child of his brain bears not even a\nremote resemblance to its descendant of to-day, yet the line is\nunbroken and the relationship clearer than many of the family trees\nof the royal houses.  The French workman’s name was Oliver Bassel,\nor Olivier Basselin, and in his way he was a poet.  He composed\nand sang certain sprightly songs which struck the popular fancy\nand achieved a reputation not only in his own town but throughout\nthe country.",
        "Bassel’s success raised the usual crop of imitators and soon a\nwhole family of songs like his were being whistled in France.  In\nthe course of time these came to be classed as a new and distinct\nform of musical entertainment.  They were given the name of\n\"Val-de-Vire” from the valley in which Bassel was born.  This\nname became corrupted, into “vaux-de-vire” in the time of Louis\nXVI, and was applied to all the popular or topical songs sung on\nthe streets of Paris.  Then the aristocrats took up these songs\nand gave entertainments at their country seats.  To these\nentertainments they gave the name of “vaux-de-ville,” the last\nsyllable being changed to honor Bassel’s native town [1] And\ngradually the x was dropped and the word has remained through the\nyears as it is to-day.",
        "[1] Another version relates that these songs were sung on the Pont\nNeuf in Paris, where stands the Hotel de Ville, or City Hall, and\nthus the generic name acquired the different termination.",
        "As the form of entertainment advanced, the word vaudeville expanded\nin meaning.  It came to comprise not only a collection of songs,\nbut also acrobatic feats and other exhibitions.  Having no dramatic\nsequence whatever, these unrelated acts when shown together achieved\nrecognition as a distinct form of theatrical entertainment.  As\n\"vaudeville\"–or “variety\"–this form of entertainment became known\nand loved in every country of the world.",
        "Vaudeville was introduced into this country before 1820, but it\ndid not become a common form of entertainment until shortly before\nthe Civil War when the word ’variety’ was at once adopted and\nbecame familiar as something peculiarly applicable to the troubled\ntimes.  The new and always cheerful entertainment found the reward\nof its optimism in a wide popularity.  But as those days of war\nwere the days of men, vaudeville made its appeal to men only.  And\nthen the war-clouds passed away and the show business had to\nreestablish itself, precisely as every other commercial pursuit\nhad to readjust itself to changed conditions.",
        "Tony Pastor saw his opportunity.  On July 31, 1865, he opened “Tony\nPastor’s Opera House” at 199-201 Bowery, New York.  He had a theory\nthat a vaudeville entertainment from which every objectionable\nword and action were taken away, and from which the drinking bar\nwas excluded, would appeal to women and children as well as men.\nHe knew that no entertainment that excluded women could long hold\na profitable place in a man’s affections.  So to draw the whole\nfamily to his new Opera House, Tony Pastor inaugurated clean\nvaudeville [1]. Pastor’s success was almost instantaneous.  It\nbecame the fashion to go to Pastor’s Opera House and later when\nhe moved to Broadway, and then up to Fourteenth Street, next to\nTammany Hall, he carried his clientele with him.  And vaudeville,\nas a form of entertainment that appealed to every member of the\nhome circle, was firmly established–for a while.",
        "[1] In the New York Clipper for December 19, 1914, there is an\ninteresting article:  “The Days of Tony Pastor,” by Al.  Fostelle,\nan old-time vaudeville performer, recounting the names of the\nfamous performers who played for Tony Pastor in the early days.\nIt reads like a “who’s who” of vaudeville history.  Mr. Fostelle,\nhas in his collection a bill of an entertainment given in England\nin 1723, consisting of singing, dancing, character impersonations,\nwith musical accompaniment, tight-rope walking, acrobatic feats,\netc.",
        "For Pastor’s success in New York did not at first seem to the\naverage vaudeville manager something that could be duplicated\neverywhere.  A large part of the profits of the usual place came\nfrom the sale of drinks and to forego this source of revenue seemed\nsuicidal.  Therefore, vaudeville as a whole continued for years\non the old plane.  “Variety” was the name–in England vaudeville\nis still called “variety\"–that it held even more widely then.\nAnd in the later seventies and the early eighties “variety” was\non the ebb-tide.  It was classed even lower than the circus, from\nwhich many of its recruits were drawn.",
        "Among the men who came to vaudeville’s rescue, because they saw\nthat to appear to the masses profitably, vaudeville must be clean,\nwere F. F. Proctor in Philadelphia, and B. F. Keith in Boston.\nOn Washington Street in Boston, B. F. Keith had opened a “store\nshow.”  The room was very small and he had but a tiny stage; still\nhe showed a collection of curiosities, among which were a two-headed\ncalf and a fat woman.  Later on he added a singer and a serio-comic\ncomedian and insisted that they eliminate from their acts everything\nthat might offend the most fastidious.  The result was that he\nmoved to larger quarters and ten months later to still more\ncommodious premised.",
        "Continuous vaudeville–\"eleven o’clock in the morning until eleven\nat night\"–had its birth on July 6, 1885.  It struck the popular\nfancy immediately and soon there was hardly a city of any importance\nthat did not possess its “continuous” house.  From the “continuous\"\nvaudeville has developed the two-performances-a-day policy, for\nwhich vaudeville is now so well known.",
        "The vaudeville entertainment of this generation is, however, a\nvastly different entertainment from that of even the nineties.\nWhat it has become in popular affection it owes not only to Tony\nPastor, F. F.  Proctor, or even to B. F. Keith–great as was his\ninfluence–but to a host of showmen whose names and activities\nwould fill more space than is possible here.  E. F. Albee, Oscar\nHammerstein, S. Z. Poli, William Morris, Mike Shea, James E. Moore,\nPercy G. Williams, Harry Davis, Morris Meyerfeld, Martin Beck,\nJohn J. Murdock, Daniel F. Hennessy, Sullivan and Considine,\nAlexander Pantages, Marcus Loew, Charles E. Kohl, Max Anderson,\nHenry Zeigler, and George Castle, are but a few of the many men\nliving and dead who have helped to make vaudeville what it is.",
        "From the old variety show, made up of a singer of topical songs,\nan acrobatic couple, a tight-rope walker, a sidewalk “patter” pair,\nand perhaps a very rough comedy sketch, there has developed a\nperformance that sometimes includes as many as ten or twelve acts,\neach one presented by an artist whose name is known around the\nworld.  One of the laments of the old vaudeville performers is\nthat they have a place in vaudeville no more.  The most famous\ngrand opera singers and the greatest actors and actresses appear\nin their room.  The most renowned dramatists write some of its\nplaylets.  The finest composers cut down their best-known works\nto fit its stage, and little operas requiring forty people and\nthree or four sets of scenery are the result.  To the legitimate\n[1] stage vaudeville has given some of its successful plays and\nat least one grand opera has been expanded from a playlet.  To-day\na vaudeville performance is the best thought of the world condensed\nto fit the flying hour.",
        "[1] Legitimate is a word used in the theatrical business to\ndistinguish the full-evening drama, its actors, producers, and its\nmechanical stage from those of burlesque and vaudeville.  Originally\ncoined as a word of reproach against vaudeville, it has lost its\nsting and is used by vaudevillians as well as legitimate actors\nand managers.",
        "There is no keener psychologist than a vaudeville manager.  Not\nonly does he present the best of everything that can be shown upon\na stage, but he so arranges the heterogeneous elements that they\ncombine to form a unified whole.  He brings his audiences together\nby advertising variety and reputations, and he sends them away\naglow with the feeling that they have been entertained every minute.\nHis raw material is the best he can buy.  His finished product is\nusually the finest his brain can form.  He engages Sarah Bernhardt,\nCalve, a Sir James M. Barrie playlet, Ethel Barrymore, and Henry\nMiller.  He takes one of them as the nucleus of a week’s bill.\nThen he runs over the names of such regular vaudevillians as Grace\nLa Rue, Nat Wills, Trixie Friganza, Harry Fox and Yansci Dollie,\nEmma Carus, Sam and Kitty Morton, Walter C.  Kelly, Conroy and\nLeMaire, Jack Wilson, Hyams and McIntyre, and Frank Fogarty.  He\nselects two or maybe three of them.  Suddenly it occurs to him\nthat he hasn’t a big musical “flash” for his bill, so he telephones\na producer like Jesse L. Lasky, Arthur Hopkins or Joe Hart and\nasks him for one of his fifteen- or twenty-people acts.  This he\nadds to his bill.  Then he picks a song-and-dance act and an\nacrobatic turn.  Suddenly he remembers that he wants–not for this\nshow, but for some future week–Gertrude Hoffman with her big\ncompany, or Eva Tanguay all by herself.  This off his mind, the\nmanager lays out his show–if it is the standard nine-act\nbill–somewhat after the following plan, as George A. Gottlieb,\nwho books Keith’s Palace Theatre, New York, shows–probably the\nbest and certainly the “biggest” vaudeville entertainments seen\nin this country–has been good enough to explain.",
        "“We usually select a ’dumb act’ for the first act on the bill.\nIt may be a dancing act, some good animal act, or any act that\nmakes a good impression and will not be spoiled by the late arrivals\nseeking their seats.  Therefore it sometimes happens that we make\nuse of a song-and-dance turn, or any other little act that does\nnot depend on its words being heard.",
        "“For number two position we select an interesting act of the sort\nrecognized as a typical ’vaudeville act.’ It may be almost anything\nat all, though it should be more entertaining than the first act.\nFor this reason it often happens that a good man-and-woman singing\nact is placed here.  This position on the bill is to ’settle’ the\naudience and to prepare it for the show.",
        "“With number three position we count on waking up the audience.\nThe show has been properly started and from now on it must build\nright up to the finish.  So we offer a comedy dramatic sketch–a\nplaylet that wakens the interest and holds the audience every\nminute with a culminative effect that comes to its laughter-climax\nat the ’curtain,’ or any other kind of act that is not of the same\norder as the preceding turn, so that, having laid the foundations,\nwe may have the audience wondering what is to come next.",
        "“For number four position we must have a ’corker’ of an act–and\na ’name.’ It must be the sort of act that will rouse the audience\nto expect still better things, based on the fine performance of\nthe past numbers.  Maybe this act is the first big punch of the\nshow; anyway, it must strike home and build up the interest for\nthe act that follows.",
        "“And here for number five position, a big act, and at the same\ntime another big name, must be presented.  Or it might be a big\ndancing act–one of those delightful novelties vaudeville likes\nso well.  In any event this act must be as big a ’hit’ as any on\nthe bill.  It is next to intermission and the audience must have\nsomething really worth while to talk over.  And so we select one\nof the best acts on the bill to crown the first half of the show.",
        "“The first act after intermission, number six on the bill, is a\ndifficult position to fill, because the act must not let down the\ncarefully built-up tension of interest and yet it must not be\nstronger than the acts that are to follow.  Very likely there is\nchosen a strong vaudeville specialty, with comedy well to the fore.\nPerhaps a famous comedy dumb act is selected, with the intention\nof getting the audience back in its seats without too many conspicuous\ninterruptions of what is going on on the stage.  Any sort of act\nthat makes a splendid start-off is chosen, for there has been a\nfine first half and the second half must be built up again–of\ncourse the process is infinitely swifter in the second half of the\nshow–and the audience brought once more into a delighted-expectant\nattitude.",
        "“Therefore the second act after intermission–number seven–must\nbe stronger than the first.  It is usually a full-stage act and\nagain must be another big name.  Very likely it is a big playlet,\nif another sketch has not been presented earlier on the bill.  It\nmay be a comedy playlet or even a serious dramatic playlet, if the\nstar is a fine actor or actress and the name is well known.  Or\nit may be anything at all that builds up the interest and appreciation\nof the audience to welcome the ’big’ act that follows.  “For here\nin number eight position–next to closing, on a nine-act bill–the\ncomedy hit of the show is usually placed.  It is one of the acts\nfor which the audience has been waiting.  Usually it is one of the\nfamous ’single’ man or ’single’ women acts that vaudeville has\nmade such favorites.",
        "“And now we have come to the act that closes the show.  We count\non the fact that some of the audience will be going out.  Many\nhave only waited to see the chief attraction of the evening, before\nhurrying off to their after-theatre supper and dance.  So we spring\na big ’flash.’ It must be an act that does not depend for its\nsuccess upon being heard perfectly.  Therefore a ’sight’ act is\nchosen, an animal act maybe, to please the children, or a Japanese\ntroupe with their gorgeous kimonos and vividly harmonizing stage\ndraperies, or a troupe of white-clad trapeze artists flying against\na background of black.  Whatever the act is, it must be a showy\nact, for it closes the performance and sends the audience home\npleased with the program to the very last minute.",
        "“Now all the time a booking-manager is laying out his show, he has\nnot only had these many artistic problems on his mind, but also\nthe mechanical working of the show.  For instance, he must consider\nthe actual physical demands of his stage and not place next each\nother two full-stage acts.  If he did, how would the stage hands\nchange the scenery without causing a long and tedious wait?  In\nvaudeville there must be no waits.  Everything must run with\nunbroken stride.  One act must follow another as though it were\nespecially made for the position.  And the entire show must be\ndovetailed to the split seconds of a stop-watch.",
        "“Therefore it is customary to follow an ’act in One’ (See below)\nwith an act requiring Full Stage.  Then after the curtain has\nfallen on this act, an act comes on to play in One again.  A show\ncan, of course, start with a full-stage act, and the alternation\nprocess remains the same.  Or there may be an act that can open\nin One and then go into Full Stage–after having given the stage\nhands time to set their scenery–or vice versa, close in One.\nBriefly, the whole problem is simply this–acts must be arranged\nnot only in the order of their interest value, but also according\nto their physical demands.",
        "“But there is still another problem the manager must solve. ’Variety’\nis vaudeville’s paternal name–vaudeville must present a varied\nbill and a show consisting of names that will tend to have a\nbox-office appeal.  No two acts in a show should be alike.  No two\ncan be permitted to conflict. ’Conflict’ is a word that falls with\nominous meaning on a vaudeville performer’s or manager’s ears,\nbecause it means death to one of the acts and injury to the show\nas a whole.  If two famous singing ’single’ women were placed on\nthe same bill, very likely there would be odious comparisons–even\nthough they did not use songs that were alike.  And however\ninteresting each might be, both would lose in interest.  And yet,\nsometimes we do just this thing–violating a minor rule to win a\ngreat big box-office appeal.",
        "“Part of the many sides of this delicate problem may be seen when\nyou consider that no two ’single’ singing acts should be placed\nnext each other–although they may not conflict if they are placed\nfar apart on the bill.  And no two ’quiet’ acts may be placed\ntogether.  The tempo of the show must be maintained–and because\ntragic playlets, and even serious playlets, are suspected of\n’slowing up a show,’ they are not booked unless very exceptional.”",
        "These are but a few of the many sides of the problem of what is\ncalled “laying out a show.”  A command of the art of balancing a\nshow is a part of the genius of a great showman.  It is a gift.\nIt cannot be analyzed.  A born showman lays out his bill, not by\nrule, but by feeling.",
        "In preparing the raw material from which the manager makes up his\nshow, the writer may play many parts.  He may bear much of the\nburden of entertainment, as in a playlet, or none of the responsibility,\nas in the average dumb act.  And yet, he may write the pantomimic\nstory that pleases the audience most.  Indeed, the writer may be\neverything in a vaudeville show, and always his part is an important\none.",
        "Of course the trained seals do not need a dramatist to lend them\ninterest, nor does the acrobat need his skill; but without the\nwriter what would the actress be, and without the song-smith, what\nwould the singer sing?  And even the animal trainer may utilize\nthe writer to concoct his “line of talk.”  The monologist, who of\nall performers seems the most independent of the author, buys his\nmerriest stories, his most up-to-the-instant jests, ready-made\nfrom the writer who works like a marionette’s master pulling the\nstrings.  The two-act, which sometimes seems like a funny impromptu\nfight, is the result of the writer’s careful thinking.  The\nflirtatious couple who stroll out on the stage to make everyone\nin the audience envious, woo Cupid through the brain of their\nauthor.  And the musical comedy, with its strong combination of\nnearly everything; is but the embodied flight of the writer’s\nfancy.  In fact, the writer supplies much of the life-blood of a\nvaudeville show.  Without him modern vaudeville could not live.",
        "Thus, much of the present wide popularity of vaudeville is due to\nthe writer.  It is largely owing to the addition of his thoughts\nthat vaudeville stands to-day as a greater influence–because it\nhas a wider appeal–than the legitimate drama in the make-believe\nlife of the land.  Even the motion pictures, which are nearer the\neyes of the masses, are not nearer their hearts.  Vaudeville was\nthe first to foster motion pictures and vaudeville still accords\nthe motion picture the place it deserves on its bills.  For\nvaudeville is the amusement weekly of the world–it gathers and\npresents each week the best the world affords in entertainment.\nAnd much of the best comes from the writer’s brain.",
        "Because mechanical novelties that are vaudeville-worth-while are\nrare, and because acrobats and animal trainers are of necessity\nlimited by the frailties of the flesh, and for the reason that\ndancers cannot forever present new steps, it remains for the writer\nto bring to vaudeville the never-ceasing novelty of his thoughts.\nNew songs, new ideas, new stories, new dreams are what vaudeville\ndemands from the writer.  Laughter that lightens the weary day is\nwhat is asked for most.",
        "It is in the fulfilling of vaudeville’s fine mission that writers\nall over the world are turning out their best.  And because the\nmission of vaudeville is fine, the writing of anything that is not\nfine is contemptible.  The author who tries to turn his talents\nto base uses–putting an untrue emphasis on life’s false values,\npicturing situations that are not wholesome, using words that are\nnot clean–deserves the fate of failure that awaits him.  As E.\nF. Albee, who for years has been a controlling force in vaudeville,\nwrote:  [1] “We have no trouble in keeping vaudeville clean and\nwholesome, unless it is with some act that is just entering, for\nthe majority of the performers are jealous of the respectable name\nthat vaudeville has to-day, and cry out themselves against\nbesmirchment by others.”",
        "[1] “The Future of the Show Business,” by E. F. Albee, in The\nBillboard for December 19, 1914.",
        "Reality and truth are for what the vaudeville writer strives.  The\nclean, the fine, the wholesome is his goal.  He finds in the many\ntheatres all over the land a countless audience eager to hear what\nhe has to say.  And millions are invested to help him say it well.",
        "“I became a writer,” George Bernard Shaw once said, “because I\nwanted to get a living without working for it–I have since realized\nmy mistake.”  Anyone who thinks that by writing for vaudeville he\ncan get a living without working for it is doomed to a sad and\nspeedy awakening.",
        "If I were called upon to give a formula for the creation of a\nsuccessful vaudeville writer, I would specify:  The dramatic genius\nof a Shakespere, the diplomatic craftiness of a Machiavelli, the\nexplosive energy of a Roosevelt, and the genius-for-long-hours of\nan Edison:  mix in equal proportions, add a dash of Shaw’s impudence,\nall the patience of Job, and keep boiling for a lifetime over the\nseething ambition of Napoleon.",
        "In other–and less extreme–words, if you contemplate writing for\nvaudeville for your bread and butter, you must bring to the business,\nif not genius, at least the ability to think, and if not boundless\nenergy, at any rate a determination never to rest content with the\nworking hours of the ordinary professions.",
        "If you suppose that the mere reading of this book is going to make\nyou able to think, permit me gently to disillusion you; and if you\nare imbued with the flattering faith that after studying these\nchapters you will suddenly be able to sit down and write a successful\nplaylet, monologue, two-act, musical comedy libretto, or even a\ngood little “gag,” in the words of classic vaudeville–forget it!\nAll this book can do for you–all any instruction can do–is to\nshow you the right path, show precisely how others have successfully\nessayed it, and wish you luck.  Do you remember the brave lines\nof W. E. Henley, the blind English poet:",
        "And again in the same poem, “Invictus”:",
        "There sings the spirit that will carry a writer to success in\nvaudeville or in any other line of writing; and it is this inspired\nattitude you should assume toward the present book of instruction.",
        "These chapters, carefully designed and painstakingly arranged,\ncontain information and suggestions which, if studied and applied\nby the right person, will help him to a mastery of vaudeville\nwriting.  But they should be viewed not as laying down rules, only\nas being suggestive.  This book cannot teach you how to write–with\nits aid you may be able to teach yourself.",
        "Are you the sort of person likely to make a success of writing for\nvaudeville?  You, alone, can determine.  But the following discussion\nof some of the elements of equipment which anyone purposing to\nwrite for vaudeville should possess, may help you find the answer.",
        "Let us suppose that you have been engaged in writing for a newspaper\nfor years.  You started as a reporter and because of your unusual\nability in the handling of political news have made politics your\nspecialty.  You have been doing nothing but politics until politics\nseems to be all you know.  Suddenly the sporting editor falls ill,\nand at the moment there is no one to take his place but you.  Your\nassistant takes over your work and you are instructed to turn out\na daily page of sporting news.",
        "If you knew nothing at all about writing you would find the task\nnearly impossible to accomplish.  But you do know how to write and\ntherefore the mere writing does not worry you.  And your experience\nas a special writer on politics has taught you that there are\ncertain points all special newspaper work has in common and you\napply your knowledge to the task before you.",
        "Still you are seriously handicapped for a time because you have\nbeen thinking in terms of politics.  But soon, by turning all your\nenergy and ability upon your new subject, you learn to think in\nterms of sport.  And, if you are a better thinker and a better\nwriter than the old sporting editor, it won’t be long before you\nturn out a better sporting page than he did.  If you were the owner\nof the newspaper, which, in the emergency, would you choose to be\nyour sporting editor:  the untried man who has never demonstrated\nhis ability to write, the reporter who has no knowledge of special\nwriting, or the trained writer who has mastered one specialty and,\nit may reasonably be supposed, will master another quickly?  The\nsame care you would exercise in choosing another man to work for\nyou, you should exercise in choosing your own work for yourself.",
        "Do you know how to write?  Do you write with ease and find pleasure\nin the work?  If you do, class yourself with the reporter.",
        "What success have you had in writing fiction?  Have you written\nsuccessful novels or short-stories?  If you have, class yourself\nwith the special writer.  Did you ever write a play?  Was your\nfull-evening play accepted and successful?  If you have written a\nplay and if your play was a success, class yourself with the\nsporting editor himself–but as one who has made a success in only\none specialty in the realm of sport.",
        "For, those who have had some success in other forms of writing–even\nthe successful playwright–and those who never have written even\na salable joke, all have to learn the slightly different form of\nthe vaudeville act.",
        "But, having once learned the form and become perfectly familiar\nwith vaudeville’s peculiar requirements, the dramatist and the\ntrained fiction writer will outstrip the untrained novice.  Remember\nthat the tortoise was determined, persistent, and energetic.",
        "The dramatist and the trained fiction writer possess imagination,\nthey think in plots, they have learned how to picture vivid,\ndramatic incidents, and they know a story when it comes up and\ntaps them on the shoulder.  Furthermore, they know where to look\nfor ideas, and how to twist them to plot uses.  In every one of\nthese points of special knowledge both the dramatist and the trained\nfiction writer have the advantage over the untrained novice, for\nthe essence of all vaudeville writing lies in plot–which is\nstory–arrangement.",
        "But there is a wide difference between being able to think in a\nstory-plot and in drama, and in this the playwright who has produced\na full-evening play has the advantage over even the trained fiction\nwriter when it comes to applying his dramatic knowledge to vaudeville.\nPrecisely what the difference is, and what drama itself is–especially\nthat angle of the art to be found in vaudeville–will be taken up\nand explained as clearly as the ideas admit of explanation, in the\nfollowing pages.  But not on one page, nor even in a whole chapter,\nwill the definition of drama be found, for pulsating life cannot\nbe bound by words.  However, by applying the rules and heeding the\nsuggestions herein contained, you will be able to understand the\n\"why” of the drama that you feel when you witness it upon the\nstage.  The ability to think in drama means being able to see drama\nand bring it fresh and new and gripping to the stage.",
        "Of course drama is nothing more than story presented by a different\nmethod than that employed in the short-story and the novel.  Yet\nthe difference in methods is as great as the difference between\npainting and sculpture.  Indeed the novel-writer’s methods have\nalways seemed to me analogous to those employed by the painter,\nand the dramatist’s methods similar to those used by the sculptor.\nAnd I have marvelled at the nonchalant way in which the fiction\nwriter often rushes into the writing of a play, when a painter\nwould never think of trying to “sculpt” until he had learned at\nleast some of the very different processes employed in the strange\nart-form of sculpture.  The radical difference between writing and\nplaywrighting [1] has never been popularly understood, but some\nday it will be comprehended by everybody as clearly as by those\nwhose business it is to make plays.",
        "[1] Note the termination of the word playwright.  A “wright” is\na workman in some mechanical business.  Webster’s dictionary says:\n\"Wright is used chiefly in compounds, as, figuratively, playwright.\"\nIt is significant that the playwright is compelled to rely for\nnearly all his effects upon purely mechanical means.",
        "An intimate knowledge of the stage itself is necessary for success\nin the writing of plays.  The dramatist must know precisely what\nmeans, such as scenery, sound-effects, and lights–the hundred\ncontributing elements of a purely mechanical nature at his command–\nhe can employ to construct his play to mimic reality.  In the\npresent commercial position of the stage such knowledge is\nabsolutely necessary, or the writer may construct an act that\ncannot possibly win a production, because he has made use of\nscenes that are financially out of the question, even if they are\nartistically possible.",
        "This is a fundamental knowledge that every person who would write\nfor the stage must possess.  It ranks with the “a b c” course in\nthe old common school education, and yet nearly every novice\noverlooks it in striving after the laurel wreaths of dramatic\nsuccess that are impossible without it.  And, precisely in the\ndegree that stage scenery is different from nature’s scenes, is\nthe way people must talk upon the stage different from the way\nthey talk on the street.  The method of stage speech–what is\nsaid, not how it is said–is best expressed in the definition\nof all art, which is summed up in the one word “suppression.”  Not\nwhat to put in, but what to leave out, is the knowledge the\nplaywright–in common with all other artists–must possess.  The\ndifference in methods between writing a novel and writing a play\nlies in the difference in the scenes and speeches that must be\nleft out, as well as in the descriptions of scenery and moods of\ncharacter that everyone knows cannot be expressed in a play by\nwords.",
        "Furthermore, the playwright is working with spoken, not written,\nwords, therefore he must know something about the art of acting,\nif he would achieve the highest success.  He must know not only\nhow the words he writes will sound when they are spoken, but he\nmust also know how he can make gestures and glances take the place\nof the volumes they can be made to speak.",
        "Therefore of each one of the different arts that are fused into\nthe composite art of the stage, the playwright must have intimate\nknowledge.  Prove the truth of this statement for yourself by\nselecting at random any play you have liked and inquiring into the\ntechnical education of its author.  The chances are scores to one\nthat the person who wrote that play has been closely connected\nwith the stage for years.  Either he was an actor, a theatrical\npress agent, a newspaper man, a professional play-reader for some\nproducer, or gained special knowledge of the stage through a\ndramatic course at college or by continual attendance at the theatre\nand behind the scenes.  It is only by acquiring special knowledge\nof one of the most difficult of arts that anyone may hope to achieve\nsuccess.",
        "It is strange but true that a writer able to produce a successful\nvaudeville playlet often writes a successful full-evening play,\nbut that only in rare instances do full-evening dramatists produce\nsuccessful vaudeville playlets.  Clyde Fitch wrote more than\nfifty-four long plays in twenty years, and yet his “Frederic\nLemaitre,” used by Henry Miller in vaudeville, was not a true\nvaudeville playlet–merely a short play–and achieved its success\nsimply because Fitch wrote it and Miller played it with consummate\nart.",
        "The vaudeville playlet and the play that is merely short, are\nseparate art forms, they are precisely and as distinctly different\nas the short-story and the story that is merely short.  It is only\nwithin the last few years that Brander Matthews drew attention to\nthe artistic isolation of the short-story; and J. Berg Esenwein,\nin his very valuable work [1], established the truth so that all\nmight read and know it.  For years I have contended for the\nrecognition of the playlet as an art form distinct from the play\nthat is short.",
        "[1] Writing the Short-Story, by J. Berg Esenwein, published uniform\nwith this volume, in, “The Writer’s Library.”",
        "And what is true of the peculiar difference of the playlet form\nis, in a lesser measure, true of the monologue, the two-act, and\nthe one-act musical comedy.  They are all different from their\nsisters and brothers that are found as integral parts of full-evening\nentertainments.",
        "To recognize these forms as distinct, to learn what material [2]\nbest lends itself to them and how it may be turned into the most\nnatural and efficient form, requires a special training different\nfrom that necessary for the writing of plays for the legitimate\nstage.",
        "[2] The word material in vaudeville means manuscript material.\nTo write vaudeville material is to write monologues and playlets\nand the other forms of stage speech used in vaudeville acts.",
        "But not only is there a vast difference between the material and\nthe art forms of the legitimate and the vaudeville stage, there\nis also a great difference in their playing stages.  The arrangements\nof the vaudeville stage, its lights and scenery, are all unique,\nas are even the playing spaces and mechanical equipment.",
        "Therefore the author must know the mechanical aids peculiar to his\nspecial craft, as well as possess a familiar knowledge of the\nmaterial that vaudeville welcomes and the unique forms into which\nthat material must be cast.",
        "The “gentle reader” who has read thus far certainly has not been\ndeterred by the emphasis–not undue emphasis, by the way–placed\non the value of proved ability in other forms of writing to one\nwho would write for vaudeville.  That he has not been discouraged\nby what has been said–if he is a novice–proves that he is not\neasily downcast.  If he has been discouraged–even if he has read\nthis far simply from curiosity–proves that he is precisely the\nperson who should not waste his time trying to write for vaudeville.\nSuch a person is one who ought to ponder his lack of fitness for\nthe work in hand and turn all his energies into his own business.\nMany a good clerk, it has been truly said, has been wasted in a\npoor writer.",
        "But, while emphasis has been laid upon the value of training in\nother forms of literary work, the emphasis has been placed not on\npurely literary skill, but on the possession of ideas and the\ntraining necessary to turn the ideas to account.  It is “up to\"\nthe ambitious beginner, therefore, to analyze the problem for\nhimself and to decide if he possesses the peculiar qualifications\nthat can by great energy and this special training place him upon\na par with the write who has made a success in other forms of\nliterary work.  For there is a sense in which no literary training\nis really necessary for success in vaudeville writing.",
        "If the amateur has an imaginative mind, the innate ability to see\nand turn to his own uses an interesting and coherent story, and\nis possessed of the ability to think in drama, and, above all, has\nthe gift of humor, he can write good vaudeville material, even if\nhe has not education or ability to write an acceptable poem, article\nor short-story.  In other words, a mastery of English prose or\nverse is not necessary for success in vaudeville writing.  Some\nof the most successful popular songs, the most successful playlets,\nand other vaudeville acts, have been written by men unable to write\neven a good letter.",
        "But the constant advancement in excellence demanded of vaudeville\nmaterial, both by the managers and the public, is gradually making\nit profitable for only the best-educated, specially-trained writers\nto undertake this form of work.  The old, illiterate, rough-and-ready\nwriter is passing, in a day when the “coon shouter” has given the\nheadline-place to Calve and Melba, and every dramatic star has\nfollowed Sarah Bernhardt into the “two-a-day.” [1]",
        "[1] The two-a-day is stage argot for vaudeville.  It comes from\nthe number of performances the actor “does,” for in vaudeville\nthere are two shows every day, six or seven days a week.",
        "Nevertheless, in this sense the novice needs no literary training.\nIf he can see drama in real life and feels how it can be turned\ninto a coherent, satisfying story, he can learn how to apply that\nstory to the peculiar requirements of vaudeville.  But no amount\nof instruction can supply this inborn ability.  The writer himself\nmust be the master of his fate, the captain of his own dramatic\nsoul.",
        "To achieve success in any art the artist must know his tools and\nfor what purposes they are designed.  Furthermore, to achieve the\nhighest success, he must know what he cannot do as well as what\nhe can do with them.",
        "The vaudeville stage–considered as a material thing–lends itself\nto only a few definite possibilities of use, and its scenery,\nlights and stage-effects constitute the box of tools the vaudeville\nwriter has at his command.",
        "The footlights are the equator of the theatre, separating the\n\"front of the house,” or auditorium, from the “back of the house,\"\nor stage.  The frame through which the audience views the stage\nis the “proscenium arch.”  Flat against the stage side of the arch\nrun the “house curtain” and the asbestos curtain that are raised\nat the beginning and lowered at the end of the performance.",
        "That portion of the stage which lies between the curving footlights\nand a line drawn between the bases of the proscenium arch is called\nthe “apron.”  The apron is very wide in old-fashioned theatres,\nbut is seldom more than two or three feet wide in recently built\nhouses.",
        "1. One",
        "Back of the proscenium arch–four feet or more behind it–you have\nnoticed canvas-covered wings painted in neutral-toned draperies\nto harmonize with every sort of curtain, and you have noticed that\nthey are pushed forward or drawn back as it is found necessary to\nwiden or make narrow the stage opening.  These first wings, called\n\"tormentors,” [1] extend upward from the floor–anywhere from\n18 to 25 feet,–to the “Grand Drapery” and “Working Drapery,” or\nfirst “border,” which extend and hang just in front of them across\nthe stage and hide the stage-rigging from the audience.  The space\nlying between the tormentors and a line drawn between the bases\nof the proscenium arch is called “One.”",
        "[1] No one of the score I have asked for the origin of the word\ntormentor has been able to give it.  They all say they have asked\nold-time stage-carpenters, but even they did not know.",
        "It is in One that monologues, most “single acts\"–that is, acts\npresented by one person–and many “two-acts\"–acts requiring but\ntwo people–are played.",
        "Behind the tormentors is a curtain called the “olio,” which\nfulfills the triple purpose of hiding the rest of the stage, serving\nas scenery for acts in One and often as a curtain to raise and\nlower on acts playing in the space back of One.",
        "2. Two",
        "Five, or six, or even seven feet behind the tormentors you have\nnoticed another set of wings which–extending parallel with the\ntormentors–serve to mask the rest of stage.  The space between\nthese wings and the line of the olio is called “Two.”",
        "In Two, acts such as flirtation-acts–a man and a woman playing\nlover-like scenes–which use scenery or small “props,” and all\nother turns requiring but a small playing space, are staged.",
        "3. Three",
        "An equal number of feet back of the wings that bound Two, are wings\nthat serve as boundaries for “Three.”",
        "In Three, playlets that require but shallow sets, and other acts\nthat need not more than twelve feet for presentation, are played.",
        "4. Four or Full Stage",
        "Behind the wings that bound Three are another pair of wings, set\nan equal number of feet back, which serve as the boundaries of\n\"Four.”  But, as there are rarely more than four entrances on any\nstage, Four is usually called “Full Stage.”",
        "In Full Stage are presented all acts such as acrobatic acts, animal\nturns, musical comedies, playlets and other pretentious acts that\nrequire deep sets and a wide playing space.",
        "5. Bare Stage",
        "Sometimes the very point of a playlet depends upon showing not the\nconventional stage, as it is commonly seen, but the real stage as\nit is, unset with scenery; therefore sometimes the entire stage\nis used as the playing stage, and then in the vernacular it is\ncalled “Bare Stage.” [1]",
        "[1] The New Leader, written by Aaron Hoffman and played for so\nmany years by Sam Mann & Company, is an excellent example of a\nBare Stage act.",
        "On the opposite page is a diagram of the stage of Keith’s Palace\nTheatre, New York City.  A comparison of the preceding definitions\nwith this diagram should give a clear understanding of the vaudeville\nplaying stage.",
        "At audience-right–or stage-left–flat against the extended wall\nof the proscenium arch in the First Entrance (to One) there is\nusually a signal-board equipped with push buttons presided over\nby the stage-manager.  The stage-manager is the autocrat behind\nthe scenes.  His duty is to see that the program is run smoothly\nwithout the slightest hitch or wait between acts and to raise and\nlower the olio, or to signal the act-curtain up or down, on\ncues. [2]",
        "[2] A cue is a certain word or action regarded as the signal for\nsome other speech or action by another actor, or the signal for\nthe lights to change or a bell to ring or something to happen\nduring the course of a dramatic entertainment.",
        "When an act is ready to begin, the stage-manager pushes a button\nto signal the olio up or raises it himself–if, that drop [1] is\nworked from the stage–and on the last cue he pushes another button\nto signal the curtain down, or lowers it himself, as the case may\nbe.  He keeps time on the various acts and sees that the performers\nare ready when their turn arrives.  Under the stage-manager are\nthe various departments to which the working of scenery and effects\nare entrusted.",
        "[1] A drop is the general name for a curtain of canvas–painted\nto represent some scene and stretched on a batten–a long, thick\nstrip of wood–pocketed in the lower end to give the canvas the\nrequired stability. Sets of lines are tied to the upper batten\non which the drop is tied and thus the drop can be raised or lowered\nto its place on the stage.  There are sets of lines in the rear\nboundaries of One, Two, Three and Four, and drops can be hung\non any desired set.",
        "As a rule the stage-manager is also the stage-carpenter.  As such\nhe, the wizard of scenery, has charge of the men, and is able to\nerect a palace, construct a tenement, raise a garden or a forest,\nor supply you with a city street in an instant.",
        "Up on the wall of the stage, just under a network of iron called\nthe “gridiron\"–on which there are innumerable pulleys through\nwhich run ropes or “lines” that carry the scenery–there is, in\nthe older houses, a balcony called the “fly-gallery.”  Into the\nfly-gallery run the ends of all the lines that are attached to the\ncounter-weighted drops and curtains; and in the gallery are the\nflymen who pull madly on these ropes to lift or lower the curtains\nand drops when the signal flashes under the finger of the stage-manager\nat the signal-board below.  But in the newer houses nearly all\ndrops and scenery are worked from the stage level, and the\nfly-gallery–if there is one–is deserted.  When a “set” is to be\nmade, the stage-carpenter takes his place in the centre of the\nstage and claps his hands a certain number of times to make his\nmen understand which particular set is wanted–if the sequence of\nthe sets has not yet been determined and written down for the\nflymen to follow in definite order.  Then the flymen lower a drop\nto its place on the stage and the “grips” push out the “flats\"\nthat make the wall of a room or the wings that form the scenery\nof a forest–or whatever the set may be.",
        "Into the mimic room that the grips are setting comes the\nProperty-man–\"Props,” in stage argot–with his assistants, who\nplace in the designated positions the furniture, bric-a-brac,\npianos, and other properties, that the story enacted in this room\ndemands.",
        "After the act has been presented and the curtain has been rung\ndown, the order to “strike” is given and the clearers run in and\ntake away all the furniture and properties, while the property-man\nsubstitutes the new furniture and properties that are needed.\nThis is done at the same time the grips and fly men are changing\nthe scenery.  No regiment is better trained in its duties.  The\nproperty-man of the average vaudeville theatre is a hard-worked\nchap.  Beside being an expert in properties, he must be something\nof an actor, for if there is an “extra man” needed in a playlet\nwith a line or two to speak, it is on him that the duty falls.\nHe must be ready on the instant with all sorts of effects, such\nas glass-crashes and wood-crashes, when a noise like a man being\nthrown downstairs or through a window is required, or if a doorbell\nor a telephone-bell must ring at a certain instant on a certain\ncue, or the noise of thunder, the wash of the sea on the shore,\nor any one of a hundred other effects be desired.",
        "Upon the electrician fall all the duties of Jove in the delicate\nmatter of making the sun to shine or the moon to cast its pale\nrays over a lover’s scene.  Next to the stage-manager’s signal-board,\nor in a gallery right over it, or perhaps on the other side of the\nstage, stands the electric switch-board.  From here all the stage\nlights and the lights in the auditorium and all over the front of\nthe house are operated.",
        "From the footlights with their red and white and blue and vari-tinted\nbulbs, to the borders that light the scenery from above, the\nbunch-lights that shed required lights through windows, the\ngrate-logs, the lamps and chandeliers that light the mimic rooms\nthemselves, and the spot-light operated by the man in the haven\nof the gallery gods out front, all are under the direction of the\nelectrician who sits up in his little gallery and makes the moonlight\nsuddenly give place to blazing sunlight on a cue.",
        "It is to the stage-manager and the stage-carpenter, the property-man\nand the electrician, that are due the working of the stage miracles\nthat delight us in the theatres.",
        "In the ancient days before even candles were invented–the rush-light\ndays of Shakespere and his predecessors–plays were presented in\nopen court-yards or, as in France, in tennis-courts in the broad\ndaylight.  A proscenium arch was all the scenery usually thought\nnecessary in these outdoor performances, and when the plays were\ngiven indoors even the most realistic scenery would have been of\nlittle value in the rush-lit semi-darkness.  Then, indeed, the\nplay was the thing.  A character walked into the STORY and out of\nit again; and “place” was left to the imagination of the audience,\naided by the changing of a sign that stated where the story had\nchosen to move itself.",
        "As the centuries rolled along, improvements in lighting methods\nmade indoor theatrical presentations more common and brought scenery\ninto effective use.  The invention of the kerosene lamp and later\nthe invention of gas brought enough light upon the stage to permit\nthe actor to step back from the footlights into a wider working-space\nset with the rooms and streets of real life.  Then with the electric\nlight came the scenic revolution that emancipated the stage forever\nfrom enforced gloomy darkness, permitted the actor’s expressive\nface to be seen farther back from the footlights, and made of the\nproscenium arch the frame of a picture.",
        "“It is for this picture-frame stage that every dramatist is composing\nhis plays,” Brander Matthews says; “and his methods are of necessity\nthose of the picture-frame stage; just as the methods of the\nElizabethan dramatic poet were of necessity those of the platform\nstage.”  And on the same page:  The influence of the realistic\nmovement of the middle of the nineteenth century imposed on the\nstage-manager the duty of making every scene characteristic of the\nperiod and of the people, and of relating the characters closely\nto their environment.” [1]",
        "[1] The Study of the Drama, Brander Matthews.",
        "On the vaudeville stage to-day, when all the sciences and the arts\nhave come to the aid of the drama, there is no period nor place,\nnor even a feeling of atmosphere, that cannot be reproduced with\namazing truth and beauty of effect.  Everything in the way of\nscenery is artistically possible, from the squalid room of the\ntenement-dweller to the blossoming garden before the palace of a\nking–but artistic possibility and financial advisability are two\nvery different things.",
        "If an act is designed to win success by spectacular appeal, there\nis no doubt that it is good business for the producer to spend as\nmuch money as is necessary to make his effects more beautiful and\nmore amazing than anything ever before seen upon the stage.  But\neven here he must hold his expenses down to the minimum that will\nprove a good investment, and what he may spend is dependent on\nwhat the vaudeville managers will pay for the privilege of showing\nthat act in their houses.",
        "But it is not worth spectacular acts that the vaudeville writer\nhas particularly to deal.  His problem is not compounded of\nextravagant scenery, gorgeous properties, trick-scenes and\nlight-effects.  Like Shakespere, for him the play–the story–is\nthe thing.  The problem he faces is an embarrassment of riches.\nWith everything artistically possible, what is financially advisable?",
        "The highest praise a vaudevillian can conjure up out of his vast\nreservoir of enthusiastic adjectives to apply to any act is, “It\ncan be played in the alley and knock ’em cold.”  In plain English\nhe means, the STORY is so good that it doesn’t require scenery.",
        "Scenery, in the business of vaudeville–please note the word\n\"business\"–has no artistic meaning.  If the owner of a dwelling\nhouse could rent his property with the rooms unpapered and the\nwoodwork unpainted, he would gladly do so and pocket the saving,\nwouldn’t he?  In precisely the same spirit the vaudeville-act owner\nwould sell his act without going to the expense of buying and\ntransporting scenery, if he could get the same price for it.  To\nthe vaudevillian scenery is a business investment.",
        "Because he can get more money for his act if it is properly mounted\nin a pleasing picture, the vaudeville producer invests in scenery.\nBut he has to figure closely, just as every other business man is\ncompelled to scheme and contrive in dollars and cents, or the\nbusiness asset of scenery will turn into a white elephant and eat\nup all his profits.",
        "Jesse L. Lasky, whose many pleasing musical acts will be remembered,\nhad many a near-failure at the beginning of his vaudeville-producing\ncareer because of his artistic leaning toward the beautiful in\nstage setting.  His subsequent successes were no less pleasing\nbecause he learned the magic of the scenery mystery.  Lasky is but\none example, and were it not that the names of vaudeville acts are\nbut fleeting memories, dimmed and eclipsed by the crowded impressions\nof many acts seen at one sitting, there might be given an amazing\nlist of beautiful little entertainments that have failed because\nof the transportation cost of the scenery they required.",
        "When a producer is approached with a request to read a vaudeville\nact he invariably asks, “What scenery?”  His problem is in two\nparts:",
        "1. He must decide whether the merits of the act, itself, justify\nhim in investing his money in scenery on the gamble that the act\nwill be a success.",
        "2. If the act proves a success, can the scenery be transported\nfrom town to town at so low a cost that the added price he can get\nfor the act will allow a gross profit large enough to repay the\noriginal cost of the scenery and leave a net profit?",
        "An experience of my own in producing a very small act–small enough\nto be in the primary class–may be as amusing as it is typical.\nMy partners and I decided to put out a quartet.  We engaged four\ngood singers, two of them men, and two women.  I wrote the little\nstory that introduced them in a humorous way and we set to work\nrehearsing.  At the same time the scenic artist hung three nice\nbig canvases on his paint frames and laid out a charming street-scene\nin the Italian Quarter of Anywhere, the interior of a squalid\ntenement and the throne room of a palace.",
        "The first drop was designed to be hung behind the Olio–for the\nact opened in One–and when the Olio went up, after the act’s name\nwas hung out, the lights dimmed to the blue and soft green of\nevening in the Quarter.  Then the soprano commenced singing, the\ntenor took up the duet, and they opened the act by walking\nrhythmically with the popular ballad air to stage-centre in the\namber of the spot-light.  When the duet was finished, on came the\nbaritone, and then the contralto, and there was a little comedy\nbefore they sang their first quartet number.",
        "Then the first drop was lifted in darkness and the scene changed\nto the interior of the squalid tenement in which the pathos of the\nlittle story unfolded, and a characteristic song was sung.  At\nlength the scene changed to the throne room of the palace, where\nthe plot resolved itself into happiness and the little opera closed\nwith the “Quartet from Rigoletto.”",
        "The act was a success; it never received less than five bows and\nalways took two encores.  But we paid three hundred and fifty\ndollars for those miracles of drops, my partners and I, and we\nused them only one week.",
        "In the first place, the drops were too big for the stage on which\nwe “tried out” the act.  We could not use them there and played\nbefore the house street-drop and in the house palace set.  The act\nwent very well.  We shipped the drops at length-rates–as all\nscenery is charged for by expressmen and railroads–to the next\ntown.  There we used them and the act went better.  It was a\nquestion whether the bigger success was due to the smoother working\nof the act or to the beautiful drops.",
        "The price for which the act was playing at that breaking-in period\nled me to ponder the cost of transporting the drops in their\nrolled-up form on the battens.  Therefore when I was informed that\nthe stage in the next town was a small one, I had a bright idea.\nI ordered the stage-carpenter to take the drops from their battens,\ndiscard the battens, and put pockets on the lower ends of the drops\nand equip the upper ends with tie ropes so the drops could be tied\non the battens used in the various houses.  The drops would then\nfit small or large stages equally well and could be folded up into\na small enough space to tuck in a trunk and save all the excess\ntransportation charges.",
        "Of course the drops folded up all right, but they unfolded in chips\nof scaled-off paint.  In the excitement, or the desire to “take a\nchance,” I had not given a thought to the plain fact that the drops\nwere not aniline.  They were doomed to chip in time anyway, and\nfolding only hastened their end.  Still, we received just as much\nmoney for the act all the time we were playing it, as though we\nhad carried the beautiful drops.",
        "Now comes the third lesson of this incident:  Although we were\nprecisely three hundred and sixty-eight dollars “out” on account\nof the drops, we really saved money in the end because we were\nforced to discard them.  The local union of the International\nAssociation of Theatrical Stage Employees–Stage Hands’ Union,\nfor short–tried to assess me in the town where we first used the\ndrops, for the salary of a stage-carpenter.  According to their\nthen iron-clad rule, before which managers had to bow, the scenery\nof every act carrying as many as three drops on battens had to be\nhung and taken down by the act’s own stage-carpenter–at forty\ndollars a week.  They could not collect from such an act today\nbecause the rules have been changed, but our act was liable, under\nthe old rules, and I evaded it only by diplomacy.  But even to-day\nevery act that carries a full set of scenery–such as a playlet\nrequiring a special set–must carry its own stage-carpenter.",
        "Therefore, to the problem of original cost and transportation\nexpense, now add the charge of forty dollars a week against\nscenery–and an average of five dollars a week extra railroad fare\nfor the stage-carpenter–and you begin to perceive why a vaudeville\nproducer asks, when you request him to read an act:  “What scenery?”",
        "There is no intention of decrying the use of special scenery in\nvaudeville.  Some of the very best and most profitable acts, even\naside from great scenic one-act dramas like “The System,” [1] would\nbe comparatively valueless without their individual sets.  And\nfurthermore the use of scenery, with the far-reaching possibilities\nof the special set in all its beauty and–on this side of the\nwater–hitherto unrealized effectiveness, has not yet even approached\nits noon.  Together with the ceaseless advance of the art of\nmounting a full-evening play on the legitimate stage [2] will go\nthe no less artistic vaudeville act.  But, for the writer anxious\nto make a success of vaudeville writing, the special set should\nbe decried.  Indeed, the special set ought not to enter into the\nwriter’s problem at all.",
        "[1] See Appendix.  [2] The Theatre of To-Day, Hiram Kelly Moderwell’s\nbook on the modem theatre, will repay reading by anyone particularly\ninterested in the special set and its possibilities.",
        "No scenery can make up for weakness of story.  Rather, like a paste\ndiamond in an exquisitely chased, pure gold setting, the paste\nstory will appear at greater disadvantage:  because of the very\nbeauty of its surroundings.  The writer should make his story so\nfine that it will sparkle brilliantly in any setting.",
        "The only thought that successful vaudeville writers give to scenery\nis to indicate in their manuscripts the surroundings that “relate\nthe characters closely to their environment.”",
        "It requires no ability to imagine startling and beautiful scenic\neffects that cost a lot of money to produce–that is no “trick.\"\nThe vaudeville scenery magic lies in making use of simple scenes\nthat can be carried at little cost–or, better still for the new\nwriter, in twisting the combinations of drops and sets to be found\nin every vaudeville house to new uses.",
        "In every vaudeville theatre there is an Olio and, although the\nscene which it is designed to represent may be different in each\nhouse, the street Olio is common enough to be counted as universally\nused.  Usually there are two drops in “One,” either of which may\nbe the Olio, and one of them is likely to represent a street, while\nthe other is pretty sure to be a palace scene.",
        "Usually in Four–and sometimes in Three–there are to be found in\nnearly every vaudeville theatre two different drops, which with\ntheir matching wings [1] form the two common “open sets\"–or scenes\ncomposed merely of a rear drop and side wings, and not boxed in.",
        "[1] A wing is a double frame of wood covered with painted canvas\nand set to stand as this book will when its covers are opened at\nright angles to each other.",
        "The Wood Set consists of a drop painted to represent the interior\nof a wood or forest, with wings painted in the same style.  It is\nused for knock-about acts, clown acts, bicycle acts, animal turns\nand other acts that require a deep stage and can play in this sort\nof scene.",
        "The Palace Set, with its drop and wings, is painted to represent\nthe interior of a palace.  It is used for dancing acts, acrobats\nand other acts that require a deep stage and can appropriately\nplay in a palace scene.",
        "A “box set” is, as the name implies, a set of scenery that is\nbox-shaped.  It represents a room seen through the fourth wall,\nwhich has been removed.  Sometimes with a, ceiling-piece, but\nalmost invariably with “borders\"–which are painted canvas strips\nhanging in front of the “border-lights” to mask them and keep the\naudience from seeing the ropes and pulleys hanging from the\ngridiron–the box set more nearly mimics reality than the open\nset, which calls upon the imagination of the audience to supply\nthe realities that are entirely lacking or only hinted at.",
        "The painted canvas units which are assembled to make the box set\nare called “flats.”  A flat is a wooden frame about six feet six\ninches wide and from twelve to eighteen feet long, covered with\ncanvas and, of course, painted with any scene desired.  It differs\nfrom a wing in being only one-half the double frame; therefore it\ncannot stand alone.",
        "Upon the upper end of each flat along the unpainted outer edge\nthere is fastened a rope as long as the flat.  Two-thirds of the\nway up from the bottom of the corresponding edge of the matching\nflat there is a “cleat,” or metal strip, into which the rope, or\n\"lash-line” is snapped.  The two flats are then drawn tight together\nso that their edges match evenly and the lash-line is lashed through\nthe framework to hold the flats firmly together.",
        "While one flat may be a painted wall, the next may contain a doorway\nand door, another a part of an ornamental arch, and still another\na window, so, when the various flats are assembled and set, the\nbox set will have the appearance of a room containing doors and\nwindows and even ornamental arches.  The most varied scenes can\nthus be realistically set up.",
        "In the rear of open doors there are usually wings, or perhaps\nflats, [1] painted to represent the walls of hallways and adjoining\nrooms and they are called “interior backings.”  Behind a door\nsupposed to open out into the street or behind windows overlooking\nthe country, there are hung, or set, short drops or wings painted\nto show parts of a street, a garden, or a country-side, and these\nare called “exterior backings.”",
        "[1] When flats are used as backings they are made stable by the\nuse of the stage-brace, a device made of wood and capable of\nextension, after the manner of the legs of a camera tripod.  It\nis fitted with double metal hooks on one end to hook into the\nwooden cross-bar on the back of the flat and with metal eyes on\nthe other end through which stage-screws are inserted and screwed\ninto the floor of the stage.",
        "The Centre-door Fancy is the most common of the box sets.  Called\n\"fancy,” because it has an arch with portieres and a rich-looking\nbacking, and because it is supposed to lead into the other palatial\nrooms of the house, this set can be used for a less pretentious\nscene by the substitution of a matched door for the arch.",
        "In this plainer form it is called simply The Parlor Set.  Sometimes\na parlor set is equipped with a French window, but this should not\nbe counted on.  But there are usually a grate and mantelpiece, and\nthree doors.  The doors are designed to be set, one in the rear\nwall, and one in each of the right and left walls.  A ceiling-piece\nis rarely found, but borders are always to be had, and a chandelier\nis customary.",
        "The Kitchen Set is, as the name implies, less pretentious than\nthe changeable parlor set.  It usually is equipped with three\ndoors, possesses matching borders, may have an ordinary window,\nand often has a fireplace panel.",
        "Slightly altered in appearance, by changing the positions of the\ndoors and the not very common substitution of a “half-glass door\"\nin the rear wall, the kitchen set does duty as The Office Set.",
        "It is in these two box sets–changed in minor details to serve as\nfour sets–that the vaudeville playlet is played.",
        "On the following pages will be found eight diagrams showing how\nthe stock or house box sets can be set in various forms.  A study\nof these will show how two different acts using the same house set\ncan be given surroundings that appear absolutely different.  These\ndiagrams should prove of great help to the playlet writer who\nwishes to know how many doors he may use, where they are placed\nand how his act will fit and play in a regulation set of scenery.",
        "The following diagrams, showing the scenic equipment of the average\nvaudeville theatre, have been specially drawn for this volume and\nare used here by courtesy of the Lee Lash Studios, New York.  As\nthey are drawn to a scale of one-eighth of an inch to the foot,\nthe precise size of the various scenes may be calculated.",
        "The diagrams are based on the average vaudeville stage, which\nallows thirty or thirty-two feet between tormentors.  The proscenium\narch may be much greater, but the average vaudeville stage will\nset the tormentors about thirty feet apart.  All vaudeville stage\nsettings are made back of the tormentor line.",
        "At the tormentor line there will be, of course, a Grand Drapery\nand Working Drapery which will mask the first entrance overhead.",
        "There will be either a set of borders for each scene, or else the\nborders will be painted to use with any scene, to mask the stage\nrigging.  The borders are usually hung from six to seven feet\napart, so that in planning a scene this should be considered.  In\na few of the larger houses, a ceiling-piece is found, but, as has\nbeen said, this is so rare it should not be counted on.",
        "Most houses have a floor cloth, and medallion or carpet, in addition\nto the properties hereafter described.  Reference to the diagrams\nwill show that the tormentors have a “flipper,” which runs to the\nproscenium arch wall; in the flipper is usually a door or a curtained\nopening for the entrances and exits of acts in One.",
        "If you will combine with the diagrams shown these elements which\ncannot be diagrammed, you will have a clear idea of the way in\nwhich any scene is constructed.  Then if you will imagine the scene\nyou have in mind as being set up on a stage like that of the Palace\nTheatre, shown in the last chapter, you will have a working\nunderstanding of the vaudeville stage.",
        "A well-ordered vaudeville stage, as has been described, possesses\nDrops for use in One, one or more Fancy Interiors, a Kitchen Set,\nand Exterior Sets.  The Drops in One are omitted from these diagrams,\nbecause they would be represented merely by a line drawn behind\nthe tormentors.",
        "The Fancy Interiors may include a Light Fancy, a Dark Fancy, an\nOak Interior, and a Plain Chamber set.  As the differences are\nlargely of painting, the usual Centre-door Fancy is taken as the\nbasis for the variations–five different ways of setting it are\nshown.",
        "Two out of the many different ways of setting the Kitchen Set are\ngiven.",
        "The Exterior Set allows little or no variation; the only thing\nthat can be done is to place balustrades, vases, etc., in different\npositions on the stage; therefore but one diagram is supplied.",
        "DIAGRAM I.–FANCY INTERIOR No. 1",
        "Showing the usual method of setting a “Fancy.”  It may be made\nshallower by omitting a wing on either side.",
        "DIAGRAM II.–FANCY INTERIOR No. 2",
        "The double arch is thrown from the centre to the side, the landscape\ndrop being used to back the scene–the drop may be seen through\nthe window on stage-left.  The window of the Fancy Interior is\nalways of the French type, opening full to the floor.",
        "DIAGRAM III.–FANCY INTERIOR No. 3",
        "This is a deeper and narrower set, approximating more closely a\nroom in an ordinary house.  The double arch at the rear may be\nbacked with an interior backing or a conservatory backing.  If the\ninterior backing is used, the conservatory backing may be used to\nback the single four-foot arch at stage-left.",
        "DIAGRAM IV.–FANCY INTERIOR No. 4",
        "This shows the double arch flanked by a single arch on each side,\nmaking three large openings looking out on the conservatory drop.",
        "DIAGRAM V.–FANCY INTERIOR No. 5",
        "The fireplace is here brought into prominence by setting it in a\ncorner with two “jogs” on each side.  The window is backed with a\nlandscape or garden drop as desired.",
        "DIAGRAM VI.–KITCHEN SET No. 1",
        "This arrangement of a Kitchen Set makes use of three doors,\nemphasizing the double doors in the centre of rear wall, which\nopen out on an interior backing or a wood or garden drop.  In this\nand the following setting a small window can be fitted into the\nupper half of either of the single doors.",
        "DIAGRAM VII.–KITCHEN SET No. 2",
        "Two doors only are used in this setting; the double doors, in the\nsame relative position as in the preceding arrangement, open out\non a wood or landscape backing.  The fireplace is brought out on\nstage-right.  The single door on stage-left opens on an interior\nbacking.",
        "DIAGRAM VIII.–WOOD OR GARDEN SET",
        "Many theatres have two sets of Exterior wings–one of Wood Wings\nand one of Garden Wings.  In some houses the Wood Wings are used\nwith the Garden Drop, set vases and balustrades being used to\nproduce the garden effect, as shown here.  Some theatres also have\na Set House and Set Cottage, which may be placed on either side\nof the stage; each has a practical door and a practical window.\nWith the Set House and Set Tree slight variations of exterior\nsettings may be contrived.",
        "4. Properties",
        "In the argot of the stage the word “property” or “prop” means any\narticle–aside from scenery–necessary for the proper mounting or\npresentation of a play.  A property may be a set of furniture, a\nrug, a pair of portieres, a picture for the wall, a telephone, a\nkitchen range or a stew-pan–indeed, anything a tall that is not\nscenery, although serving to complete the effect and illusion of\na scene.",
        "Furniture is usually of only two kinds in a vaudeville playhouse.\nThere is a set of parlor furniture to go with the parlor set and\na set of kitchen furniture to furnish the kitchen set.  But, while\nthese are all that are at the immediate command of the property-man,\nhe is usually permitted to exchange tickets for the theatre with\nany dealer willing to lend needed sets of furniture, such as a\ndesk or other office equipment specially required for the use of\nan act.",
        "In this way the sets of furniture in the property room may be\nexpanded with temporary additions into combinations of infinite\nvariety.  But, it is wise not to ask for anything out of the\nordinary, for many theatre owners frown upon bills for hauling,\neven though the rent of the furniture may be only a pair of seats.",
        "For the same reason, it is unwise to specify in the property-list–\nwhich is a printed list of the properties each act requires–anything\nin the way of rugs that is unusual.  Though some theatres have\nmore than two kinds of rugs, the white bear rug and the carpet rug\nare the most common.  It is also unwise to ask for pictures to\nhang on the walls.  If a picture is required, one is usually\nsupplied set upon an easel.",
        "Of course, every theatre is equipped with prop telephones and sets\nof dishes and silver for dinner scenes.  But there are few vaudeville\nhouses in the country that have on hand a bed for the stage,\nalthough the sofa is commonly found.",
        "A buffet, or sideboard, fully equipped with pitchers and wine\nglasses, is customary in every vaudeville property room.  And\nchampagne is supplied in advertising bottles which “pop” and sparkle\nnone the less realistically because the content is merely ginger\nale.",
        "While the foregoing is not an exhaustive list of what the property\nroom of a vaudeville theatre may contain, it gives the essential\nproperties that are commonly found.  Thus every ordinary requirement\nof the usual vaudeville act can be supplied.",
        "The special properties that an act may require must be carried by\nthe act.  For instance, if a playlet is laid in an artist’s studio\nthere are all sorts of odds and ends that would lend a realistic\neffect to the scene.  A painter’s easel, bowls of paint brushes,\na palette, half-finished pictures to hang on the walls, oriental\ndraperies, a model’s throne, and half a dozen rugs to spread upon\nthe floor, would lend an atmosphere of charming bohemian realism.",
        "Special Sound-Effects fall under the same common-sense rule.\nFor, while all vaudeville theatres have glass crashes, wood crashes,\nslap-sticks, thunder sheets, cocoanut shells for horses’ hoof-beats,\nand revolvers to be fired off-stage, they could not be expected\nto supply such little-called-for effects as realistic battle sounds,\nvolcanic eruptions, and like effects.",
        "If an act depends on illusions for its appeal, it will, of course,\nbe well supplied with the machinery to produce the required sounds.\nAnd those that do not depend on exactness of illusion can usually\nsecure the effects required by calling on the drummer with his\nvery effective box-of-tricks to help out the property-man.",
        "At the electrical switchboard centre all the lights of the theatre,\nas well as those of the stage itself.  Presided over by the\nelectrician, the switchboard, so far as the stage and its light\neffects are concerned, commands two classes of lights.  The first\nof these is the arc light and the second the electric bulb.",
        "The Spot-lights are the lamps that depend upon the arc for their\nillumination.  If you have ever sat in the gallery of any theatre,\nand particularly of a vaudeville theatre, you certainly have noticed\nthe very busy young man whose sole purpose in life appears to be\nto follow the heroine around the stage with the focused spot of\nlight that shines like a halo about her.  The lamp with which he\naccomplishes this difficult feat is appropriately called a\n\"spot-light.”  While there are often spot-lights on the electrician’s\n\"bridge,” as his balcony is called, the gallery out front is the\nsurest place to find the spot-light.",
        "The Footlights are electric bulbs dyed amber, blue, and red–\nor any other special shade desired–beside the well-known white,\nset in a tin trough sunk in the stage and masked to shine only\nupon the stage.  By causing only one group of colors to light,\nthe electrician can secure all sorts of variations, and with the\naid of “dimmers” permit the lights to shine brilliantly or merely\nto glow with faint radiance.",
        "The Border-lights are electric bulbs of varying colors set in\ntin troughs a little longer than the proscenium opening and are\nsuspended above the stage behind the scenery borders.  They shine\nonly downward.  There are border-lights just in front of the drops\nin One, Two, Three and Four, and they take the names of “first\nborder-light,” “second border-light,” and so on from the drops\nthey illuminate.",
        "Strip-lights are electric bulbs set in short strips of tin\ntroughs, that are equipped with hooks by which they can be hung\nbehind doors and out-of-the-way dark places in sets to illuminate\nthe backings.",
        "A Bunch-light is a box of tin set on a standard, which can be\nmoved about the stage the length of its electric cord, and has ten\nor twelve electric bulbs inside that cast a brilliant illumination\nwherever it is especially desired.  Squares of gelatine in metal\nframes can be slipped into the grooves in front of the bunch-light\nto make the light any color or shade desired.  These boxes are\nespecially valuable in giving the effect of blazing sunlight just\noutside the doors or windows of a set, or to shine through the\nwindows in the soft hue of moonlight.",
        "Grate Logs are found in nearly every vaudeville house and are\nmerely iron painted to represent logs of wood, inside of which are\nconcealed lamps that shine up through red gelatine, simulating the\nglow of a wood fire shining in the fireplace under the mantelpiece\nusually found in the centre-door-fancy set.",
        "Special Light-effects have advanced so remarkably with the science\nof stage illumination that practically any effect of nature may\nbe secured.  If the producer wishes to show the water rippling on\nthe river drop there is a “ripple-lamp” at his command, which is\na clock-actuated mechanism that slowly revolves a ripple glass in\nfront of a “spot-lamp” and casts a realistic effect of water\nrippling in the moonlight.",
        "By these mechanical means, as well as others, the moon or the sun\ncan be made to shine through a drop and give the effect of rising\nor of setting, volcanos can be made to pour forth blazing lava and\na hundred other amazing effects can be obtained.  In fact, the\nmodern vaudeville stage is honeycombed with trapdoors and overhung\nwith arching light-bridges, through which and from which all manner\nof lights can be thrown upon the stage, either to illuminate the\nfaces of the actors with striking effect, or to cast strange and\nbeautiful effects upon the scenery.  Indeed, there is nothing to\nbe seen in nature that the electrician cannot reproduce upon the\nstage with marvellous fidelity and pleasing effect.",
        "But the purpose here, as in explaining all the other physical\ndepartments of the vaudeville stage, is not to tell what has been\ndone and what can be done, interesting and instructive as such a\ndiscussion would be, but to describe what is usually to be found in\na vaudeville theatre.  The effects that are at ready command are\nthe only effects that should interest anyone about to write for\nvaudeville.  As was emphasized in the discussion of scenery, the\nwriter should not depend for success on the unusual.  His aim\nshould be to make use of the common stage-effects that are found on\nevery vaudeville stage–if, indeed, he depends on any effects at all.",
        "Here, then, we have made the acquaintance of the physical proportions\nand aspects of the vaudeville stage and have inquired into all the\ndepartments that contribute to the successful presentation of a\nvaudeville entertainment.  We have examined the vaudeville writer’s\ntool-box and have learned to know the uses for which each tool of\nspace, scenery, property, and light is specially designed.  And\nby learning what these tools can do, we have also learned what\nthey cannot do.",
        "Now let us turn to the plans and specifications–called manuscripts–\nthat go to make up the entertaining ten or forty minutes during which\na vaudeville act calls upon these physical aids to make it live\nupon the mimic stage, as though it were a breathing reality of the\ngreat stage of life.",
        "The word monologue comes from the combination of two Greek words,\nmonos, alone, and legein, to speak.  Therefore the word monologue\nmeans “to speak alone\"–and that is often how a monologist feels.\nIf in facing a thousand solemn faces he is not a success, no one\nin all the world is more alone than he.",
        "It appears easy for a performer to stroll into a theatre, without\nbothersome scenery, props, or tagging people, and walk right out\non the stage alone and set the house a-roar.  But, like most things\nthat appear easy, it is not.  It is the hardest “stunt” in the\nshow business, demanding two very rare things:  uncommon ability\nin the man, and extraordinary merit in the monologue itself.",
        "To arrive at a clear understanding of what a monologue is, the\nlong way around through the various types of “talking singles” may\nbe the shortest cut home to the definition.",
        "The soliloquy of the by-gone days of dramatic art was sometimes\ncalled a monologue, because the person who spoke it was left alone\nupon the stage to commune with himself in spoken words that described\nto the audience what manner of man he was and what were the problems\nthat beset him.  Hamlet’s “To be or not to be,” perhaps the most\nfamous of soliloquies, is, therefore, a true monologue in the\nancient sense, for Hamlet spoke alone when none was near him.  In\nthe modern sense this, and every other soliloquy, is but a speech\nin a play.  There is a fundamental reason why this is so:  A monologue\nis spoken to the audience, while in a soliloquy (from the Latin\nsolus, alone, loqui, to talk) the actor communes with himself\nfor the “benefit” of the audience.",
        "There are all sorts of entertaining talking acts in vaudeville\npresented by a single person.  Among them are the magician who\nperforms his tricks to the accompaniment of a running fire of talk\nwhich, with the tricks themselves, raises laughter; and the person\nwho gives imitations and wins applause and laughter by fidelity\nof speech, mannerisms and appearance to the famous persons imitated.\nYet neither of these can be classed as a monologist, because neither\ndepends upon speech alone to win success.",
        "Nor, in the strictest vaudeville sense, is a monologue merely a\nstring of stories that possesses no unity as a whole and owns as\nits sole reason of being that of amusement and entertainment.  For\ninstance, apropos of nothing whatever an entertainer may say:",
        "  I visited Chinatown the other evening and took dinner in one of\n  the charming Oriental restaurants there.  The first dish I ordered\n  was called Chop Suey.  It was fine.  They make it of several\n  kinds of vegetables and meats, and one dark meat in particular\n  hit my taste.  I wanted to find out what it was, so I called the\n  waiter.  He was a solemn-looking Chinaman, whose English I could\n  not understand, so I pointed to a morsel of the delicious dark\n  meat and, rubbing the place where all the rest of it had gone,\n  I asked:",
        "    “Quack-quack?”\n\n    The Chink grinned and said:\n\n    “No.  No.  Bow-wow.”",
        "Before the laughter has subsided the entertainer continues:",
        "  That reminds me of the deaf old gentleman at a dinner party who\n  was seated right next to the prettiest of the very young ladies\n  present.  He did his best to make the conversation agreeable,\n  and she worked hard to make him understand what she said.  But\n  finally she gave it up in despair and relapsed into a pained\n  silence until the fruit was passed.  Then she leaned over and\n  said:",
        "  “Do you like bananas?”",
        "  A smile of comprehension crept over the deaf old man’s face and\n  he exclaimed:",
        "  “No, I like the old-fashioned night-gowns best.”",
        "And so, from story to story the entertainer goes, telling his funny\nanecdotes for the simple reason that they are funny and create\nlaughter.  But funny as they are, they are disconnected and,\ntherefore, do not meet the requirement of unity of character, which\nis one of the elements of the pure monologue.",
        "If the entertainer had told the stories of the Chinaman and the\ndeaf old gentleman as though they had happened to a single character\nabout whom all the stories he tells revolve, his act and his\nmaterial would more nearly approach the pure monologue form.  For\ninstance:",
        "  Casey’s a great fellow for butting into queer places to get a\n  bite to eat.  The other evening we went down to Chinatown and\n  in one of those Oriantal joints that hand out Chop Suey in real\n  china bowls with the Jersey City dragoons on ’em, we struck a\n  dish that hit Casey just right.",
        "  “Mither av Moses,” says Casey, “this is shure the atein fer ye;\n  but what’s thot dilicate little tid-bit o’ brown mate?”\n  \n  “I don’t know,” says I.",
        "  “Oi’ll find out,” says Casey.  “Just listen t’me spake that\n  heathen’s language.”",
        "  “Here, boy,” he hollers, “me likee, what you call um?”",
        "  The Chink stares blankly at Casey.  Casey looks puzzled, then\n  he winks at me.  Rubbing his hand over the place where the rest\n  of the meat had gone, he says:",
        "  “Quack-quack?”",
        "  A gleam shot into the Chink’s almond eyes and he says:\n\n  “No.  No.  Bow-wow.”",
        "  It took seven of us to hold Casey, he felt that bad.  But that\n  wasn’t a patchin’ to the time we had dinner with a rich friend\n  o’ ours and Casey was seated right next to the nicest little old\n  lady y’ever saw. . . .",
        "And so on until the banana story is told, with Casey the hero and\nvictim of each anecdote.",
        "But an entertainer feels no necessity of making his entire offering\nof related anecdotes only.  Some monologists open with a song\nbecause they want to get the audience into their atmosphere, and\n\"with” them, before beginning their monologue.  The song merely\nby its melody and rhythm helps to dim the vividness of impression\nleft by the preceding act and gives the audience time to quiet\ndown, serving to bridge the psychic chasm in the human mind that\nlies between the relinquishing of one impression and the reception\nof the next.",
        "Or the monologist may have a good finishing song and knows that\nhe can depend on it for an encore that will bring him back to tell\nmore stories and sing another song.  So he gives the orchestra\nleader the cue, the music starts and off he goes into his song.",
        "Or he may have some clever little tricks that will win applause,\nor witty sayings that will raise a laugh, and give him a chance\nto interject into his offering assorted elements of appeal that\nwill gain applause from different classes of people in his audience.\nTherefore, as his purpose is to entertain, he sings his song,\nperforms his tricks, tells his witty sayings, or perhaps does an\nimitation or two, as suits his talent best.  And a few end their\nacts with serious recitations of the heart-throb sort that bring\nlumps into kindly throats and leave an audience in the satisfied\nmood that always comes when a touch of pathos rounds off a hearty\nlaugh.",
        "But by adding to his monologue unrelated offerings the monologist\nbecomes an “entertainer,” an “impersonator,” or whatever title\nbest describes his act.  If he stuck to his stories only and told\nthem all on a single character, his offering would be a monologue\nin the sense that it observes the unity of character, but still\nit would not be a pure monologue in the vaudeville sense as we now\nmay define it–though a pure monologue might form the major part\nof his “turn.”",
        "Having seen in what respects other single talking acts–the\nsoliloquy, the “talking single” that has no unity of material, the\ndisconnected string of stories, and the connected series of stories\ninterspersed with songs–differ from the pure monologue, it will\nnow be a much simpler task to make plain the elements that compose\nthe real vaudeville monologue.",
        "The real monologue possesses the following eight characteristics:",
        "Each of these eight characteristics has either been mentioned\nalready or will be taken up in detail later, so now we can combine\nthem into a single paragraphic definition:",
        "The pure vaudeville monologue is a humorous talk spoken by one\n  person, possesses unity of character, is not combined with any\n  other entertainment form, is marked by compression, follows a\n  definite form of construction and usually requires from ten to\n  fifteen minutes for delivery.",
        "It must be emphasized that because some single talking acts do not\nmeet every one of the requirements is no reason for condemning\nthem [1]. They may be as fine for entertainment purposes as the\npure monologue, but we must have some standard by which to work\nand the only true standard of anything is its purest form.\nTherefore, let us now take up the several parts that make up the\npure monologue as a whole, and later we shall consider the other\nmonologue variations that are permissible and often desirable.",
        "[1] Frank Fogarty, “The Dublin Minstrel,” one of the most successful\nmonologists in vaudeville, often opens with a song and usually\nends his offering with a serious heart-throb recitation.  By making\nuse of the song and serious recitation Mr. Fogarty places his act\nin the “entertainer\" class, but his talking material is, perhaps,\nthe best example of the “gag\"-anecdotal-monologue to be found in\nvaudeville.",
        "Mr. Fogarty won The New York Morning Telegraph contest to determine\nthe most popular performer in vaudeville in 1912, and was elected\nPresident of “The White Rats\"–the vaudeville actors’ protective\nUnion–in 1914.    [end footnote]",
        "If you have not yet turned to the appendix and read Aaron Hoffman’s\n\"The German Senator” do so now.  (See Appendix.)  It will be referred\nto frequently to illustrate structural points.",
        "All monologues, whether of the pure type or not, possess one element\nin common–humor.  I have yet to hear of a monologist who did not\nat least try to be funny.  But there are different types of monologic\nhumor.",
        "“Each eye,” the Italians say, “forms its own beauty,” so every\nnation, every section, and each individual forms its own humor to\nsuit its own peculiar risibilities.  Still, there are certain\nwell-defined kinds of stories and classes of points in which we\nAmericans find a certain delight.",
        "What these are the reader knows as well as the writer and can\ndecide for himself much better than I can define them for him.\nTherefore, I shall content myself with a mere mention of the basic\ntechnical elements that may be of suggestive help.",
        "(a) The Element of Incongruity.  “The essence of all humor,” it\nhas been said, “is incongruity,” and in the monologue there is no\none thing that brings better laugh-results than the incongruous.\nNote in the Appendix the closing point of “The German Senator.\"\nCould there be any more incongruous thing than wives forming a\nUnion?",
        "(b) Surprise.  By surprise is meant leading the audience to\nbelieve the usual thing is going to happen, and “springing” the\nunusual–which in itself is often an incongruity, but not necessarily\nso.",
        "(c) Situation.  Both incongruity and surprise are part and parcel\nof the laughter of a situation.  For instance; a meeting of two\npeople, one of whom is anxious to avoid the other–a husband, for\ninstance, creeping upstairs at three A. M. meeting his wife–or\nboth anxious to avoid each other–wife was out, too, and husband\novertakes wife creeping slowly up, doing her best not to awaken\nhim, each supposing the other in bed and asleep.  The laughter\ncomes because of what is said at that particular moment in that\nparticular situation–\"and is due,” Freud says, “to the release\nfrom seemingly unpleasant and inevitable consequences.”",
        "(d) Pure Wit.  Wit exists for its own sake, it is detachable\nfrom its context, as for example:",
        "  And what a fine place they picked out for Liberty to stand.\n  With Coney Island on one side and Blackwell’s Island on the\n  other. [1]",
        "[1] The German Senator.  See Appendix.",
        "(e) Character.  The laughable sayings that are the intense\nexpression at the instant of the individuality of the person voicing\nthem, is what is meant by the humor of character.  For instance:\nthe German Senator gets all “balled up” in his terribly long effort\nto make a “regular speech,” and he ends:",
        "We got to feel a feeling of patriotic symptoms–we got to feel\n  patriotic symp–symps–you got to feel the patri–you can’t help\n  it, you got to feel it.",
        "These five suggestions–all, in the last analysis, depending on\nthe first, incongruity–may be of assistance to the novice in\nanalyzing the elements of humor and framing his own efforts with\nintelligence and precision.",
        "In considering the other elemental characteristics of the monologue,\nwe must bear in mind that the emphasizing of humor is the monologue’s\nchief reason for being.",
        "Unity of character does not mean unity of subject–note the variety\nof subjects treated in “The German Senator\"–but, rather, the\nsingleness of impression that a monologue gives of the “character\"\nwho delivers it, or is the hero of it.",
        "The German Senator, himself, is a politician “spouting,” in a\nperfectly illogical, broken-English stump speech, about the condition\nof the country and the reason why things are so bad.  Never once\ndo the various subjects stray far beyond their connection with the\ncountry’s deplorable condition and always they come back to it.\nFurthermore, not one of the observations is about anything that a\npolitician of his mental calibre would not make.  Also the\nconstruction of every sentence is in character.  This example is,\nof course, ideal, and the precision of its unity of character one\nof the great elements of a great monologue.",
        "Next to humor, unity of character is the most important requirement\nof the monologue.  Never choose a subject, or write a joke, that\ndoes not fit the character delivering the monologue.  In other\nwords, if you are writing a pure monologue, do not, just because\nit is humorous, drag in a gag [1] or a point [2] that is not in\ncharacter or that does not fit the subject.  Make every turn of\nphrase and every word fit not only the character but also the\nsubject.",
        "[1] A gag is the vaudeville term for any joke or pun.",
        "[2] A point is the laugh-line of a gag, or the funny observation\nof a monologue.",
        "We have long heard that “brevity is the soul of wit,” and certainly\nwe realize the truth in a hazy sort of way, but the monologue\nwriter should make brevity his law and seven of his ten commandments\nof writing.  Frank Fogarty, who writes his own gags and delivers\nthem in his own rapid, inimitable way, said to me:",
        "“The single thing I work to attain in any gag is brevity.  I never\nuse an ornamental word, I use the shortest word I can and I tell\na gag in the fewest words possible.  If you can cut out one word\nfrom any of my gags and not destroy it, I’ll give you five dollars,\nand it’ll be worth fifty to me to lose it.  “You can kill the whole\npoint of a gag by merely an unnecessary word.  For instance, let\nus suppose the point of a gag is ’and he put the glass there’;\nwell, you won’t get a laugh if you say, ’and then he picked the\nglass up and put it there.’ Only a few words more–but words are\ncostly.",
        "“Take another example.  Here’s one of my best gags, a sure-fire\nlaugh if told this way:",
        "“O’Brien was engaged by a farmer to milk cows and do chores.  There\nwere a hundred and fifty cows, and three men did the milking.  It\nwas hard work, but the farmer was a kind-hearted, progressive man,\nso when he went to town and saw some milking-stools he bought three\nand gave ’em to the men to sit down on while at work.  The other\ntwo men came back delighted, but not O’Brien.  At last he appeared,\nall cut-up, and holding one leg of the stool.",
        "“’What’s the matter?’ said the farmer.",
        "“’Nothing, only I couldn’t make the cow sit down on it.’",
        "“When I tell it this way it invariably gets a big laugh.  Now\nhere’s the way I once heard a ’chooser’ [1] do it.",
        "[1] Chooser–one who chooses some part of another performer’s act\nand steals it for his own use.",
        "“’O’Brien came to this country and looked around for work.  He\ncouldn’t get a job until at last a friend told him that a farmer\nup in the country wanted a man to milk cows.  So O’Brien got on a\ntrolley car and went out to the end of the line, took a side-door\npullman from there, was ditched and had to walk the rest of the\nway to the farm.  But at last he got to the farmer’s place and\nasked him for the job.",
        "“’\"Sure I can use you,” said the farmer, “here’s a milk pail and\na milking-stool.  Take ’em and go out and milk the cows in the\nbarn.”",
        "“’Now O’Brien didn’t know how to milk a cow, he’d never milked a\ncow in his whole life, but he needed a job so he didn’t tell the\nfarmer he hadn’t ever milked a cow.  He took the pail and the\nmilking-stool and went out to the barn.  After half an hour he\ncame back to the farm house all cut-up, and he had one leg of the\nmilking-stool in his hand.",
        "“’\"What’s the matter?” asked the farmer, “How’d you get all cut\nup–been in a fight or something?”",
        "“’\"No,” said O’Brien, “I couldn’t get the cow to sit on it.’”",
        "“See the difference?  There’s only one right way to tell any gag\nand that’s to make it brief, little–like the works of a watch\nthat’ll fit in a thin watch case and be better and finer than a\nbig turnip of a pocket clock.”",
        "So, then, each point and gag in a monologue is told in the fewest,\nshortest words possible and the monologue, as a whole, is marked\nby compression.  Remember, “brevity is the soul of wit\"–never\nforget it.",
        "If a successful monologue writer has in mind two gags that are\nequally funny he will invariably choose the one that can be told\nmost vividly–that is, the one that can be told as if the characters\nthemselves were on the stage.  For instance, the words, “Here stood\nJohn and there stood Mary,” with lively, appropriate gestures by\nthe monologist, make the characters and the scene seem living on\nthe stage before the very eyes of the audience.  That is why the\nmonologist illustrates his points and gags with gestures that\npicturize.",
        "Every gag and every point of great monologues are told in words\nthat paint pictures.  If the gag is supposititious, and the direct\nright-here-they-stood method cannot be used, the point is worded\nso strikingly, and is so comically striking in itself, that the\naudience sees–visualizes–it. [1]",
        "[1] Walter Kelly, “The Virginia Judge,” offers a fine example of\nthe monologist who makes his words picturize.  He “puts his stories\nover” almost without a gesture.",
        "Unlike the playlet, the monologue does not have flesh-and-blood\npeople on the stage to act the comic situation.  The way a point\nor gag is constructed, the words used, the monologist’s gestures,\nand his inflections, must make the comic situation live in vivid\npictures.",
        "Therefore, in selecting material the monologue writer should choose\nthose gags and points that can be told in pictures, and every word\nhe uses should be a picture-word.",
        "A monologue–like the thin-model watch mentioned–is made up of\nmany parts.  Each part fits into, the other–one gag or point\nblends perfectly into the following one–so that the entire monologue\nseems not a combination of many different parts, but a smoothly\nworking, unified whole.",
        "Count the number of different points there are in “The German\nSenator” and note how each seemingly depends on the one before it\nand runs into the one following; you will then see what is meant\nby blending.  Then read the monologue again, this time without the\nPanama Canal point–plainly marked for this exposition–and you\nwill see how one part can be taken away and still leave a smoothly\nreading and working whole.",
        "It is to careful blending that the monologue owes its smoothness.\nThe ideal for which the writer should strive is so to blend his\ngags and points that, by the use of not more than one short sentence,\nhe relates one gag or point to the next with a naturalness and\ninevitableness that make the whole perfectly smooth.",
        "We are now, I think, in a position to sum up the theory of the\nmonologue.  The pure vaudeville monologue, which was defined as a\nhumorous talk spoken by one person, possesses unity of character,\nis not combined with any other entertainment form, is marked by\ncompression, follows a definite form of construction, and usually\nrequires from ten to fifteen minutes for delivery.  Humor is its\nmost notable characteristic; unity of the character delivering it,\nor of its “hero,” is its second most important requirement.  Each\npoint, or gag, is so compressed that to take away or add even one\nword would spoil its effect; each is expressed so vividly that the\naction seems to take place before the eyes of the audience.  Finally,\nevery point leads out of the preceding point so naturally, and\nblends into the following point so inevitably, that the entire\nmonologue is a smooth and perfect whole.",
        "Before an experienced writer takes up his pencil he has formed\ndefinitely in his mind just what he is going to write about–that\nis the simple yet startling difference between the experienced\nwriter and the novice.  Not only does the former know what his\nsubject is, but he usually knows how he is going to treat it, and\neven some striking phrases and turns of sentences are ready in his\nmind, together with the hundreds of minute points which, taken\ntogether, make up the singleness of impression of the whole.",
        "But just as it is impossible for the human mind–untrained, let\nus say, in the art of making bricks–to picture at a glance the\nvarious processes through which the clay passes before it takes\nbrick form, so it is identically as impossible for the mind of the\nnovice to comprehend in a flash the various purposes and half-purposes\nthat precede the actual work of writing anything.",
        "True as this is of writing in general, it seems to me particularly\ntrue of writing the monologue, for the monologue is one of those\nprecise forms of the art of writing that may best be compared to\nthe miniature, where every stroke must be true and unhesitating\nand where all combine unerringly to form the composite whole.",
        "In preparing monologue material the writer usually is working in\nthe sounds of spoken–and mis-spoken–words, and the humor that\nlies in the twisting of ideas into surprising conclusions.  He\nseldom deliberately searches for a theme–more often some\nlaugh-provoking incident or sentence gives him an idea and he\nbuilds it into a monologue with its subject for the theme.",
        "Anything at all in the whole range of subjects with which life\nabounds will lend itself for a monologue theme–provided the writer\ncan without straining twist it to the angle of humor; but propriety\ndemands that nothing blatantly suggestive shall be treated, and\ncommon sense dictates that no theme of merely local interest shall\nbe used, when the purpose of the monologue is to entertain the\nwhole country.  Of course if a monologue is designed to entertain\nmerely a certain class or the residents of a certain city or section\nonly, the very theme–for instance, some purely local happening\nor trade interest–that you would avoid using in a monologue planned\nfor national use, would be the happiest theme that could be chosen.\nBut, as the ambitious monologue writer does not wish to confine\nhimself to a local or a sectional subject and market, let us\nconsider here only themes that have universal appeal.",
        "      Politics                  Woman Suffrage\n      Love                      Drink\n      Marriage                  Baseball\n      Woman’s Dress             Money",
        "While there are many more themes that can be twisted to universal\ninterest–and anyone could multiply the number given–these few\nare used in whole or in part in nearly every successful monologue\nnow being presented.  And, they offer to the new writer the surest\nground to build a new monologue.  That they have all been done\nbefore is no reason why they should not be done again:  the new\nauthor has only to do them better–and a little different.  It is\nall a matter of fresh vision.  What is there in any art that is\nreally new–but treatment?",
        "Do not make the fatal mistake of supposing that these few themes\nare the only themes possessing universal interest.  Anything in\nthe whole wide world may be the subject for a monologue, when\ntransmuted by the magic of common sense and uncommon ability into\nuniversal fun.",
        "As a monologue is a collection of carefully selected and smoothly\nblended points or gags, with a suitable introduction to the routine\n[1]–each point and gag being a complete, separate entity, and the\nintroduction being as truly distinct–the monologue writer, unlike\nthe playlet writer, may begin to write anywhere.  He may even write\nthe last point or gag used in the routine before he writes the\nfirst.  Or he may write the twelfth point before he writes either\nthe first one or the last one.  But usually, he writes his\nintroduction first.",
        "[1] Routine–the entire monologue; but more often used to suggest\nits arrangement and construction.  A monologue with its gags and\npoints arranged in a certain order is one routine; a different\nroutine is used when the gags or points are arranged in a different\norder.  Thus routine means arrangement.  The word is also used to\ndescribe the arrangement of other stage offerings–for instance, a\ndance:  the same steps arranged in a different order make a new\n\"dance routine.”",
        "A monologue introduction may be just one line with a point or a\ngag that will raise a snicker, or it may be a long introduction\nthat stamps the character as a “character,” and causes amusement\nbecause it introduces the entire monologue theme in a bright way.",
        "An example of the short introduction is:",
        "“D’you know me friend Casey?  He’s the guy that put the sham in\nshamrock,” then on into the first gag that stamps Casey as a\nsure-’nuff “character,” with a giggle-point to the gag.",
        "The very best example of the long introduction being done on the\nstage today is the first four paragraphs of “The German Senator.\"\nThe first line, “My dear friends and falling Citizens,” stamps the\nmonologue unquestionably as a speech.  The second line, “My heart\nfills up with vaccination to be disabled,” declares the mixed-up\ncharacter of the oration and of the German Senator himself, and\ncauses amusement.  And the end of the fourth paragraph–which you\nwill note is one long involved sentence filled with giggles–raises\nthe first laugh.",
        "Nat Wills says the introduction to the gag-monologue may often\nprofitably open with a “local\"–one about the town or some local\nhappening–as a local is pretty sure to raise a giggle, and will\ncause the audience to think the monologist “bright” and at least\nstart their relations off pleasantly.  He says:  “Work for giggles\nin your introduction, but don’t let the audience get set–with a\nbig laugh–until the fifth or sixth joke.”",
        "The introduction, therefore, is designed to establish the monologist\nwith the audience as “bright,” to stamp the character of the\n\"character” delivering it–or about whom the gags are told–and\nto delay a big laugh until the monologist has “got” his audience.",
        "The “point,” you will recall, we defined as the funny observation\nof a pure monologue–in lay-conversation it means the laugh line\nof a joke; and “gag” we defined as a joke or a pun.  For the sake\nof clearness let us confine “point” to a funny observation in a\nmonologue, and “gag” to a joke in a connected series of stories.",
        "It is impossible for anyone to teach you how to write a really\nfunny point or a gag.  But, if you have a well-developed sense of\nhumor, you can, with the help of the suggestions for form given\nhere and the examples of humor printed in the appendix, and those\nyou will find in the funny papers and hear along the street or on\nthe stage, teach yourself to write saleable material.  All that\nthis chapter can hope to do for you is to show you how the best\nmonologue writes and the most successful monologists work to achieve\ntheir notable results, and thus put you in the right path to\naccomplish, with the least waste of time and energy, what they\nhave done.",
        "Therefore, let us suppose that you know what is humorous, have a\nwell-developed sense of humor, and can produce really funny points\nand gags.  Now, having your points and gags clearly framed in mind\nand ready to set down on paper, you naturally ask, How shall I\narrange them?  In what order shall I place them to secure the best\neffect for the whole monologue?",
        "Barrett Wendell, professor of English at Harvard University, [1]\nhas suggested an effective mechanical aid for determining the\nclearest and best arrangement of sentences and paragraphs in English\nprose, and his plan seems especially adapted to help the monologue\nwriter determine a perfect routine.  Briefly his method may be\nparaphrased thus:",
        "[1] English Composition, page 165.",
        "Have as many cards or slips of paper as you have points or gags.\nWrite only one point or gag on one card or slip of paper.  On the\nfirst card write “Introduction,” and always keep that card first\nin your hand.  Then take up a card and read the point or gag on\nit as following the introduction, the second card as the second\npoint or gag, and so on until you have arranged your monologue in\nan effective routine.",
        "Then try another arrangement.  Let us say the tenth joke in the\nfirst routine reads better as the first joke.  All right, place\nit in your new arrangement right after the introduction.  Perhaps\nthe fourteenth point or gag fits in well after the tenth gag–fine,\nmake that fourteenth gag the second gag; and so on through your\ncards until you have arranged a new routine.",
        "Your first arrangement can invariably be improved–maybe even your\nseventh arrangement can be made better; very good, by shuffiing\nthe cards you may make as many arrangements as you wish and\neventually arrive at the ideal routine.  And by keeping a memorandum\nof preceding arrangements you can always turn back to the older\nroutine–if that appears the best after all other arrangements\nhave been tried.",
        "But what is really the ideal arrangement of a monologue?  How may\nyou know which routine is really the best?  Frankly, you cannot\nknow until it has been tried out on an audience many, many\ntimes–and has been proved a success by actual test.  Arranging a\nroutine of untried points and gags on paper is like trying to solve\na cut-out puzzle with the key-piece missing.  Only by actually\ntrying out a monologue before an audience and fitting the points\nand gags to suit the monologist’s peculiar style (indeed, this is\nthe real work of writing a monologue and will be described later\non) can you determine what really is the best routine.  And even\nthen another arrangement may “go” better in another town.  Still\nthere are a few suggestions–a very few–that can be given here\nto aid the beginner.",
        "Like ocean waves, monologic laughs should come in threes and\nnines–proved, like most rules, by exceptions.  Note the application\nof this rule in “The German Senator.”",
        "Study the arrangement of the points in this great monologue and\nyou will see that each really big point is dependent on several\nminor points that precede it to get its own big laugh.  For instance,\ntake the following point:",
        "  And if meat goes any higher, it will be worth more than money.",
        "  Then there won’t be any money.",
        "  Instead of carrying money in your pocket, you’ll carry meat\n  around.",
        "  A sirloin steak will be worth a thousand dollar bill.",
        "  When you go down to the bank to make a deposit, instead of giving\n  the cashier a thousand dollar bill, you’ll slip him a sirloin\n  steak.",
        "  If you ask him for change, he’ll give you a hunk of bologny.\n  \nThe first line blends this point with the preceding one about\nthe high cost of eggs.  The second line awakens interest and\nprepares for the next, “Instead of carrying money in your pocket,\nyou’ll carry meat around,” which is good for a grin.  The next\nline states the premise necessary for the first point-ending\n\"–you’ll slip him a sirloin steak,” which is always good for a\nlaugh.  Then the last line, “If you ask him for change, he’ll\ngive you a hunk of bologny,” tops the preceding laugh.",
        "From this example you see what is meant by monologic laughs coming\nin threes and nines.  The introduction of each new story–the line\nafter the blend-line–should awaken a grin, its development cause\na chuckle, and the point-line itself raise a laugh.",
        "Each new point should top the preceding point until with the end\nof that particular angle or situation, should come a roar of honest\nlaughter.  Then back to the grin, the chuckle, and on to the laugh\nagain, building up to the next big roar.",
        "With the end of the monologue should come complete satisfaction\nin one great burst of laughter.  This, of course, is the ideal.",
        "A monologue should run anywhere from ten to fifteen minutes.  The\nmonologist can vary his playing time at will by leaving out points\nand gags here and there, as necessity demands, so the writer should\nsupply at least a full fifteen minutes of material in his manuscript.",
        "“How shall I time my manuscript?” is the puzzling problem the new\nwriter asks himself.  The answer is that it is very difficult to\ntime a monologue exactly, because different performers work at\ndifferent speeds and laughs delay the delivery and, therefore,\nmake the monologue run longer.  But here is a very rough counting\nscale that may be given, with the warning that it is far from\nexact:",
        "For every one hundred and fifteen to one hundred and forty words\ncount one minute for delivery.  This is so inexact, depending as\nit does on the number of laughs and the monologist’s speed of\ndelivery, that it is like a rubber ruler.  At one performance it\nmay be too long, at another too short.",
        "Having given a full fifteen minutes of material, filled, let us\nhope, with good points made up of grins, chuckles and laughs, now\nchoose your very biggest laugh-point for the last.  When you wrote\nthe monologue and arranged it into the first routine, that biggest\nlaugh may have been the tenth, or the ninth, or the fifteenth, but\nyou have spotted it unerringly as the very biggest laugh you\npossess, so you blend it in as the final laugh of the completed\nmonologue.",
        "It may now be worth while thus to sum up the ideal structure:",
        "A routine is so arranged that the introduction stamps the monologist\nas bright, and the character he is impersonating or telling about\nas a real “character.”  The first four points or gags are snickers\nand the fifth or sixth is a laugh. [1] Each point or gag blends\nperfectly into the ones preceding and following it.  The introduction\nof each new story awakens a grin, its development causes a chuckle,\nand the point-line itself raises a laugh.  The final point or gag\nrounds the monologue off in the biggest burst of honest laughter.",
        "[1] It is true that some monologists strive for a laugh on the\nvery first point, but to win a big laugh at once is very rare.",
        "When a writer delivers the manuscript of a monologue to a monologist\nhis work is not ended.  It has just begun, because he must share\nwith the monologist the pains of delivering the monologue before\nan audience.  Dion Boucicault once said, “A play is not written,\nbut rewritten.”  True as this is of a play, it is, if possible,\neven more true of a monologue.",
        "Of course, not all beginners can afford to give this personal\nattention to staging a monologue, but it is advisable whenever\npossible.  For, points that the author and the monologist himself\nwere sure would “go big,” “die,” while points and gags that neither\nthought much of, “go big.”  It is for precisely this purpose of\nweeding out the good points and gags from the bad that even famous\nmonologists “hide away,” under other names, in very small houses\nfor try-outs.  And while the monologist is working on the stage\nto make the points and gags “get over,” the author is working in\nthe audience to note the effect of points and finding ways to\nchange a phrase here and a word there to build dead points into\nlife and laughter.  Then it is that they both realize that Frank\nFogarty’s wise words are true:  “There is only one way to tell a\ngag.  If you can cut one word out from any of my gags I’ll give\nyou five dollars, for it’s worth fifty to me.  Words are costly.”",
        "Some entire points and gags will be found to be dead beyond\nresurrection, and even whole series of gags and points must be\ncast away and new and better ones substituted to raise the golden\nlaughs.  So the monologue is changed and built performance after\nperformance, with both the monologist and the author working as\nthough their very lives depended on making it perfect.",
        "Then, when it is “set” to the satisfaction of both, the monologist\ngoes out on the road to try it out on different audiences and to\nwrite the author continually for new points and gags.  It may be\nsaid with perfect truth that a monologue is never finished.  Nat\nWills, the Tramp Monologist, pays James Madison a weekly salary\nto supply him with new jokes every seventh day.  So, nearly every\nmonologist retains the author to keep him up to the minute with\nmaterial, right in the forefront of the laughter-of-the-hour.",
        "The discussion of the monologue form has been exhaustive, for the\npure monologue holds within itself all the elements of the other\nallied forms.  The only difference between a pure monologue and\nany other kind is in the addition of entertainment features that\nare not connected gags and points.  Therefore, to cover the field\ncompletely it is necessary only to name a few of the many different\nkinds of single talking acts and to describe them briefly.",
        "The most common talking singles–all of whom buy material from\nvaudeville writers–are:",
        "(a) The Talking Magician–who may have only a few little tricks\nto present, but who plays them up big because he sprinkles his\nwork with laughter-provoking points.",
        "(b) The “Nut Comedian”–who does all manner of silly tricks to\nmake his audience laugh, but who has a carefully prepared routine\nof “nut” material.",
        "(c) The Parody Monologist–who opens and closes with funny\nparodies on the latest song hits and does a monologue routine\nbetween songs.",
        "(d) The “Original Talk” Impersonator–who does impersonations\nof celebrities, but adds to his offering a few clever points and\ngags.",
        "Before you seek a market [1] for your monologue, be sure that it\nfulfills all the requirements of a monologue and that it is the very\nbest work you can do.  Above all, make sure that every gag or point\nyou use is original with you, and that the angle of the subject you\nhave selected for your theme is honestly your own.  For if you have\ncopied even one gag or point that has been used before, you have laid\nyour work open to suspicion and yourself to the epithet of “chooser.”",
        "[1] See Chapter XXIV, Manuscripts and Markets.",
        "The infringer–who steals gags and points bodily–can be pursued\nand punished under the copyright law, but the chooser is a kind\nof sneak thief who works gags and points around to escape taking\ncriminal chances, making his material just enough different to\nevade the law.  A chooser damages the originator of the material\nwithout himself getting very far.  No one likes a chooser; no one\nknowingly will have dealings with a chooser.  Call a vaudeville\nman a liar and he may laugh at you–call him a chooser and you’ll\nhave to fight him.",
        "There are, of course, deliberate choosers in the vaudeville business,\njust as there are “crooks” in every line of life, but they never\nmake more than a momentary success.  Here is why they invariably\nfail:",
        "When you sit in the audience, and hear an old gag or point, you\nwhisper, “Phew, that’s old,” or you give your companion a knowing\nlook, don’t you?  Well, half the audience is doing the very same\nthing, and they, like you, receive the impression that all the\ngags are old, and merely suppose that they haven’t heard the other\nones before.",
        "The performer, whose bread and butter depends on the audience\nthinking him bright, cannot afford to have anything ancient in his\nroutine.  Two familiar gags or points will kill at least twenty-five\npercent of his applause.  He may not get even one bow, and when\naudiences do not like a monologist well enough to call him out for\na bow, he might as well say good-by to his chances of getting even\nanother week’s booking.  Therefore the performer watches the\nmaterial that is offered him with the strained attention of an\nAsiatic potentate who suspects there is poison in his breakfast\nfood.  He not only guards against old gags or points, but he takes\ngreat care that the specific form of the subject of any routine\nthat he accepts is absolutely new.",
        "Some of the deliberate choosers watch the field very closely and\nas soon as anyone strikes a new vein or angle they proceed to work\nit over.  But taking the same subject and working around it–even\nthough each gag or point is honestly new–does not and cannot pay.\nEven though the chooser secures some actor willing to use such\nmaterial, he fails ultimately for two reasons:  In the first place,\nthe copier is never as good as the originator; and, in the second\nplace, the circuit managers do not look with favor upon copy-acts.",
        "As the success of the performer depends on his cleverness and the\nnovelty of his material, in identically the same way the success\nof a vaudeville theatre lies in the cleverness and novelty of the\nacts it plays.  Individual house managers, and therefore circuit\nmanagers, cannot afford to countenance copy-acts.  For this reason\na monologist or an act is often given exclusive rights to use a\nprecise kind of subject-material over a given circuit.  A copy-act\ncannot keep going to very long with only a few segregated house\nwilling to play his act.",
        "Therefore before you offer your monologue to a possible buyer, be\nsure–absolutely sure–that your theme and every one of your points\nand gags are original.",
        "The word “two-act” is used to describe any act played by two\npeople.  It has nothing to do with the number of scenes or acts\nof a drama.  When two people present a “turn,” it is called a\ntwo-act.  It is a booking-office term–a word made necessary by\nthe exigencies of vaudeville commerce.",
        "If the manager of a theatre requires an acrobatic act to fill his\nbill and balance his show he often inquires for an acrobatic\ntwo-act.  It may matter little to him whether the act plays in One\nor Full Stage–he wants an acrobatic act, and one presented by two\npeople.  If he requires any other kind of two-people-act, he\nspecifies the kind of two-act of which he is in need.",
        "On the other hand, if a performer asks an author to write a\nvaudeville two-act, an act of a certain definite character is\nusually meant and understood.  For, among writers, the vaudeville\ntwo-act–or “act in One” as it is often called–has come to mean\na talking act presented by two persons; furthermore, a talking act\nthat has certain well-defined characteristics.",
        "The most carefully constructed definition cannot describe even the\nsimplest thing with satisfying exactness.  But the human mind is\nso formed that it have a definition for a guide to learn anything\nis new.  Therefore let us set up this dogmatic definition:",
        "A pure vaudeville two-act is a humorous talking act performed\n  by two persons.  It possesses unity of the characters, is not\n  combined with songs, tricks or any other entertainment form, is\n  marked by compression, follows a definite form of construction,\n  and usually requires from ten to fifteen minutes for delivery.",
        "You have noticed that this definition is merely that of the monologue\nvery slightly changed.  It differs from it only in the number of\npersons required for its delivery.  But, like many such verbal\njugglings, the likeness of the two-act to the monologue is more\napparent than real.",
        "Turn to the Appendix and read “The Art of Flirtation,” by Aaron\nHoffman. [1] It was chosen for publication in this volume as an\nexample of the vaudeville two-act, for two reasons:  First, it is\none of the best vaudeville two-acts ever written; second, a careful\nstudy of it, in connection with “The German Senator,” will repay\nthe student by giving an insight into the difference in treatment\nthat the same author gives to the monologue and the two-act.",
        "[1] The Art of Flirtation,” by Aaron Hoffman, has been used in\nvaudeville, on the burlesque stage, and in various musical comedies,\nfor years and has stood the test of time.",
        "Aside from the merely physical facts that two persons deliver the\nvaudeville two-act and but one “does” the monologue, you will\nnotice in reading “The Art of Flirtation,” that the two-act depends\na surprising lot on “business” [1] to punch home its points and\nwin its laughs.  This is the first instance in our study of\nvaudeville material in which “acting” [2] demands from the writer\nstudied consideration.",
        "[1] Business means any movement an actor makes on the stage.\nTo walk across the stage, to step on a man’s toes, to pick up a\ntelephone, to drop a handkerchief, or even to grimace–if done to\ndrive the spoken words home, or to “get over” a meaning without\nwords–are all, with a thousand other gestures and movements,\nstage business.",
        "[2] Acting is action.  It comprises everything necessary to the\nperforming of a part in a play and includes business.",
        "So large a part does the element of business play in the success\nof the two-act that the early examples of this vaudeville form\nwere nearly all built out of bits of business.  And the business\nwas usually of the “slap-stick” kind.",
        "Slap-stick humor wins its laughs by the use of physical methods,\nhaving received its name from the stick with which one clown hits\nanother.",
        "A slap-stick is so constructed that when a person is hit a light\nblow with it, a second piece of wood slaps the first and a\nsurprisingly loud noise, as of a hard blow, is heard.  Children\nalways laugh at the slap-stick clowns and you can depend upon many\ngrown-ups, too, going into ecstasies of mirth.",
        "Building upon this sure foundation, a class of comedians sprang\nup who “worked up” the laughter by taking advantage of the human\ndelight in expectation.  For instance:  A man would lean over a\nwall and gaze at some distant scene.  He was perfectly oblivious\nto what was going on behind him.  The comedy character strolled\nout on the stage with a stick in his hand.  He nearly walked into\nthe first man, then he saw the seat of the man’s trousers and the\nprovokingly tempting mark they offered.  In the early days of the\nuse of the slap-stick, the comedian would have spanked the man at\nonce, got one big laugh and have run off the stage in a comic\nchase.  In the later days the comedian worked up his laugh into\nmany laughs, by spacing all of his actions in the delivery of the\nblow.",
        "As soon as the audience realized that the comedian had the opportunity\nto spank the unsuspecting man, they laughed.  Then the comedian\nwould make elaborate preparations to deliver the blow.  He would\nspit on his hands, grasp the stick firmly and take close aim–a\nlaugh.  Then he would take aim again and slowly swing the stick\nover his shoulder ready to strike–a breathless titter.  Down would\ncome the stick–and stop a few inches short of the mark and the\ncomedian would say:  “It’s a shame to do it!”  This was a roar, for\nthe audience was primed to laugh and had to give vent to its\nexpectant delight.  A clever comedian could do this twice, or even\nthree times, varying the line each time.  But usually on the third\npreparation he would strike–and the house would be convulsed.",
        "In burlesque they sometimes used a woman for the victim, and the\nlaughter was consequently louder and longer.  It is an interesting\ncommentary on the advancement of all branches of the stage in\nrecent years that even in burlesque such extreme slap-stick methods\nare now seldom used.  In vaudeville such an elemental bit of\nslap-stick business is rarely, if ever, seen.  Happily, a woman\nis now never the victim.",
        "But it was upon such “sure-fire” [1] bits of business that the\nearly vaudeville two-acts–as well as many other acts–depended\nfor a large percentage of their laughs.  It mattered little what\nwere the lines they spoke.  They put their trust in business–and\ninvariably won.  But their business was always of the same type\nas that “bit” [2] of spanking the unsuspecting man.  It depended\nfor its humor on the supposed infliction of pain.  It was always\nphysical–although by no means always even remotely suggestive.",
        "[1] Any act or piece of business or line in a speech that can be\ndepended on to win laughter at every performance is called\nsure-fire.",
        "[2] Anything done on the stage may be called a bit.  A minor\ncharacter may have only a bit, and some one part of a scene that\nthe star may have, may be a bit.  The word is used to describe a\nsuccessful little scene that is complete in itself.",
        "Because such acts did not depend on lines but on slap-stick humor,\nthey became known as slap-stick acts.  And because these vaudeville\ntwo-acts–as we have elected to call them–were usually presented\nby two men and worked in One, in front of a drop that represented\na street, they were called “sidewalk comedian slap-stick acts.”",
        "Their material was a lot of jokes of the “Who was that lady I saw\nyou with last night?\"–\"She weren’t no lady, she was my wife,\"\nkind.  Two performers would throw together an act made up of\nsure-fire comedy bits they had used in various shows, interpolate\na few old “gags\"–and the vaudeville writer had very little\nopportunity.",
        "But to-day–as a study of “The Art of Flirtation” will show–wit\nand structural skill in the material itself is of prime importance.\nTherefore the writer is needed to supply vaudeville two-acts.  But\neven to-day business still plays a very large part in the success\nof the two-act.  It may even be considered fundamental to the\ntwo-act’s success.  Therefore, before we consider the structural\nelements that make for success in writing the two-act, we shall\ntake up the matter of two-act business.",
        "The fact that we all laugh–in varying degrees–at the antics of\nthe circus clown, should be sufficient evidence of the permanence\nof certain forms of humor to admit of a belief in the basic truth\nthat certain actions do in all times find a humorous response in\nall hearts.  Certain things are fundamentally funny, and have made\nour ancestors laugh, just as they make us laugh and will make our\ndescendants laugh.",
        "“There’s no joke like an old joke,” is sarcastically but nevertheless\nliterally true.  There may even be more than a humorous\ncoincidence–perhaps an unconscious recognition of the sure-firedness\nof certain actions–in the warnings received in childhood to “stop\nthat funny business.”",
        "However this may be, wherever actors foregather and talk about\nbits of stage business that have won and always will win laughs\nfor them, there are a score or more points on which they agree.\nNo matter how much they may quarrel about the effectiveness of\nlaugh-bits with which one or another has won a personal success–due,\nperhaps, to his own peculiar personality–they unite in admitting\nthe universal effectiveness of certain good old stand-bys.",
        "Weber and Fields–before they made so much money that they retired\nto indulge in the pleasant pastime of producing shows–presented\nprobably the most famous of all the sidewalk comedian slap-stick\nacts. [1] They elevated the slap-stick sidewalk conversation act\ninto national popularity and certainly reduced the business of\ntheir performance to a science–or raised it to an art.  In an\narticle entitled “Adventures in Human Nature,” published in The\nAssociated Sunday Mazagines for June 23, 1912, Joe Weber and Lew\nFields have this to say about the stage business responsible, in\nlarge measure, for the success of their famous two-act:",
        "  The capitalizing of the audiences’ laughter we have set down in\n  the following statistics, ranged in the order of their value.\n  An audience will laugh loudest at these episodes:",

        "  (2) When a man sticks two fingers into another man’s eyes.",
        "  (3) When a man chokes another man and shakes his head from side\n  to side.",

        "  Human nature–as we have analyzed it, with results that will be\n  told you by the cashier at our bank–will laugh louder and oftener\n  at these spectacles, in the respective order we have chronicled\n  them, than at anything else one might name.  Human nature here,\n  as before, insists that the object of the attacks–the other\n  man–be not really hurt.",
        "  Now, let us tell you how we arrived at our conclusions.  The eye\n  is the most delicate part of the body.  If a man, therefore,\n  pokes his two forefingers into the eyes of another man without\n  hurting them, then human nature will make you scream with mirth;\n  not at the sight of the poking of the fingers into the other\n  man’s eyes (as you who have seen us do this trick night in and\n  night out have imagined), but because you get all the sensations\n  of such a dangerous act without there being any actual pain\n  involved in the case of the man you were watching.  You laugh\n  because human nature tells you to.  You laugh because the man\n  who had the fingers stuck into his eyes might have been hurt\n  badly, but wasn’t.",
        "  The greatest laughter, the greatest comedy, is divided by a hair\n  from the greatest tragedy.  Always remember that!  As the chance\n  of pain, the proportion of physical misery, the proportion of\n  tragedy, becomes diminished (see the other items in the table),\n  so does the proportion of laughter become less and less.  We\n  have often tried to figure out a way to do something to the\n  other’s kneecap–second in delicacy only to the eye–but the\n  danger involved is too great.  Once let us figure out the trick,\n  however, and we shall have capitalized another item that may be\n  listed high in our table.  Here is how you can verify the truth\n  of our observations yourself:",
        "  You have seen those small imitation tacks made of rubber.  Exhibit\n  one, put it on a chair, ask a stranger to sit down–and everybody\n  who is in on the joke will scream with mirth.

        "George M. Cohan spent his boyhood on the vaudeville stage as one\nof “The Four Cohans.”  In collaboration with George J. Nathan, Mr.\nCohan published in McClure’s Magazine for November, 1913, an article\nentitled “The Mechanics of Emotion.”  Here is what he has to say\nabout some bits of business that are sure-fire laughs:  [1]",
        "[1] These sure-fire bits of business should be considered as being\nequally effective when used in any form of stage work.  Some of\nthem, however, lend themselves most readily to the vaudeville\ntwo-act.",
        "  Here, then, are a few of the hundred-odd things that you constantly\n  laugh at on the stage, though, when you see them in cold type,\n  you will probably be ashamed of doing so.",
        "  (1) Giving a man a resounding whack on the back under the guise\n  of friendship.  The laugh in this instance may be “built up\"\n  steadily in a climacteric way by repeating the blow three times\n  at intervals of several minutes.",
        "  (2) A man gives a woman a whack on the back, believing in an\n  absent-minded moment that the woman (to whom he is talking) is\n  a man.",
        "  (3) One character steps on the sore foot of another character,\n  causing the latter to jump with pain.",
        "  (4) The spectacle of a man laden with many large bundles.",
        "  (5) A man or a woman starts to lean his or her elbow on a table\n  or the arm of a chair, the elbow slipping off abruptly and\n  suddenly precipitating him or her forward.",
        "  (6) One character imitating the walk of another character, who\n  is walking in front of him and cannot see him.",
        "  (7) A man consuming a drink of considerable size at one quick\n  gulp.",
        "  (8) A character who, on entering an “interior” or room scene,\n  stumbles over a rug.  If the character in point be of the\n  “dignified” sort, the power of this laugh provoker is doubled.",
        "  (9) Intoxication in almost any form. [1]",
        "[1] Intoxication, however, must never be revolting.  To be welcomed,\nit must always be funny; in rare instances, it may be pathetic.",
        "  (10) Two men in heated conversation.  One starts to leave.\n  Suddenly, as if fearing the other will kick him while his back\n  is turned, this man bends his body inward (as if he actually had\n  been kicked) and sidles off.",
        "  (11) A man who, in trying to light his cigar or cigarette, strikes\n  match after match in an attempt to keep one lighted.  If the man\n  throws each useless match vigorously to the floor with a muttered\n  note of vexation the laughter will increase.",
        "  (12) The use of a swear-word. [2]",
        "[2] The use of swear-words is prohibited in most first-class\nvaudeville theatres.  On the walls of every B. F. Keith Theatre\nis posted this notice:  “The use of ’Damn’ and ’Hell’ is forbidden\non the stage of this theatre.  If a performer cannot do without\nusing them, he need not open here.”",
        "  (13) A man proclaims his defiance of his wife while the latter\n  is presumably out of hearing.  As the man is speaking, his wife’s\n  voice is heard calling him.  Meekly he turns and goes to her.\n  This device has many changes, such as employer and employee.\n  All are equally effective.",
        "  (14) A pair of lovers who try several times to kiss, and each\n  time are interrupted by the entrance of some one or by the ringing\n  of the doorbell or telephone-bell or something of the sort.",
        "  (15) A bashful man and a not-bashful woman are seated on a bench\n  or divan.  As the woman gradually edges up to the man, the man\n  just as gradually edges away from her.",
        "  All these “laugh-getters” are known to the experienced as “high\n  class\"; that is, they may all be used upon the legitimate stage.\n  On the burlesque and vaudeville stages devices of a somewhat\n  lower intellectual plane have established a permanent standing\n  An authority on this phase of the subject is Mr. Frederick\n  Wyckoff, who catalogues the following as a few of the tricks\n  that make a vaudeville audience laugh:",
        "  Open your coat and show a green vest, or pull out your shirt\n  front and expose a red undershirt.  Another excellent thing to\n  do is to wear a shirt without sleeves and pull off your coat\n  repeatedly. [1]",
        "[1] Such ancient methods of winning laughs, however, belong to\nvaudeville yesterdays.  It should be remembered that Mr. Nathan,\nwho bore the labor of writing this excellent article, is blessed\nwith a satirical soul–which, undoubtedly, is the reason why he\nis so excellent and so famous a dramatic critic.",
        "  Ask the orchestra leader if he is married.",
        "  Have the drummer put in an extra beat with the cymbals, then\n  glare at him.",
        "  Always use an expression which ends with the query, “Did he not?\"\n  Then say, “He did not.”",
        "  The men who elaborated this kind of thing into a classic are\n  Messrs. Weber and Fields.  They are the great presiding deities\n  of “slap-stick” humor.  They have capitalized it to enormous\n  financial profit.  They claim that Mr. Fields’ favorite trick\n  of poking his forefinger periodically in Mr. Weber’s eye is worth\n  a large fortune in itself.  A peculiarity of this kind of humor\n  is that it finds its basis in the inflicting of pain.  A painful\n  situation apparently contains elements of the ridiculous so long\n  as the pain is not actually of a serious nature.  Here, too, the\n  stage merely mirrors life itself.  We laugh at the person who\n  falls on the ice, at the man who bumps against a chair or table\n  in the dark, at the headache of the “morning after,” at the boy\n  who eats green apples and pays the abdominal penalty, at the\n  woman whose shoes are so tight they hurt her, at the person who\n  is thrown to the floor by a sudden lurch of a street-car, and\n  at the unfortunate who sits on a pin.  A man chasing his rolling\n  hat in the street makes everybody laugh.",
        "  The most successful tricks or jokes are all based on the idea\n  of pain or embarrassment.  Tacks made of rubber, matches that\n  explode or refuse to light, exploding cigars or cigarettes,\n  fountain-pens that smear ink over the fingers immediately they\n  are put to use, “electric” bells with pins secreted in their\n  push buttons, and boutonnieres that squirt water into the face\n  of the beholder, are a few familiar examples.",
        "Here, then, we have the bits of business that three of the ablest\nproducers of the legitimate stage–all graduates from vaudeville,\nby the way–agree upon as sure-fire for the vaudeville two-act.\nParadoxically, however, they should be considered not as instructive\nof what you should copy, but as brilliant examples of what you\nshould avoid.  They belong more to vaudeville’s Past than to its\nPresent.  Audiences laughed at them yesterday–they may not laugh\nat them tomorrow.  If you would win success, you must invent new\nbusiness in the light of the old successes.  The principles\nunderlying these laugh-getters remain the same forever.",
        "If you will read again what Weber and Fields have to say about\ntheir adventures in human nature, you will note that not once do\nthey mention the lines with which they accompanied the business\nof their two-act.  Several times they mention situation–which is\nthe result of action, when it is not its cause–but the words by\nwhich they accompanied those actions and explained those situations\nthey did not consider of enough importance to mention.  Every\nsuccessful two-act, every entertainment-form of which acting is\nan element–the playlet and the full-evening play as well–prove\nbeyond the shadow of a doubt that what audiences laugh at–what\nyou and I laugh at–is not words, but actions and situations.",
        "Later on, this most important truth–the very life-blood of stage\nreality–will be taken up and considered at greater length in the\nstudy of the playlet.  But it cannot be mentioned too often.  It\nis a vital lesson that you must learn if you would achieve even\nthe most fleeting success in writing for the stage in general and\nvaudeville in particular.",
        "But by action is not meant running about the stage, or even wild\nwavings of the arms.  There must be action in the idea–in the\nthought–even though the performers stand perfectly still.",
        "So it is not with words, witty sayings, funny observations and\ntopsy-turvy language alone that the writer works, when he constructs\na vaudeville two-act.  It is with clever ideas, expressed in\nlaughable situations and actions, that his brain is busy when he\nbegins to marshal to his aid the elements that enter into the\npreparation of two-act material.",
        "It is very likely that in your study of “The German Senator” and\n\"The Art of Flirtation,” there has crossed your mind this thought:\nBoth the monologue and the two-act are composed of points and gags.\nThe only difference–besides the merely physical difference of two\npersons delivering the gags and the greater amount of business\nused to “get them over” [1]–lies in the way the gags are constructed.\nThe very same gags–twisted just a little differently–would do\nequally well for either the monologue or the two-act.",
        "[1] To get over a vaudeville line or the entire act, means to\nmake it a success–to make it get over the foot-lights so that the\naudience may see and appreciate it, or “get” it.",
        "There is just enough truth in this to make it seem an illuminating\nfact.  For instance, take the “janitor point” in “The German\nSenator.”  We may imagine the characters of a two-act working up\nthrough a routine, and then one saying to the other:",

But only a few points of “The German Senator\"\ncould be used for a two-act, with nearly as much effect as in the\nmonologue form.  For instance, take the introduction.  Of course,\nthat is part and parcel of the monologue form, and therefore seems\nhardly a fair example, yet it is particularly suggestive of the\nunique character of much monologic material.",

        "How could business be introduced in this gag–without having the\nobvious effect of being lugged in by the heels?  Business, to be\neffective, must be the body of the material’s soul.

        "Yet it is in a measure true that some of the points and gags that\nare used in many monologues–rarely the anecdotal gag, however,\nwhich must be acted out in non-two-act form–would be equally\neffective if differently treated in the two-act.

Everything in the\nchapter on “The Nature of the Monologue” is as true of the two-act\nas of the monologue, if you use discrimination.  Refer to what was\nsaid about humor, unity of character, compression, vividness,\nsmoothness and blending, and read it all again in the light of the\npeculiar requirements of the two-act.  They are the elements that\nmake for its success.",
        "The two-act–like all stage material in which acting plays a\npart–is not written; it is constructed.  You may write with the\ngreatest facility, and yet fail in writing material for the\nvaudeville stage.  The mere wording of a two-act means little, in\nthe final analysis.  It is the action behind the words that suggests\nthe stage effect.  It is the business–combined with the acting–that\ncauses the audience to laugh and makes the whole a success.  So\nthe two-act, like every other stage form, must–before it is\nwritten–be thought out.",
        "In the preceding chapter, you read of the elements that enter into\nthe construction of a two-act.

In this\nchapter we shall consider what you must have before you even begin\nto think out your two-act–your theme.",
        "Imitation may be the sincerest flattery, but it is dangerous for\nthe imitator.  And yet to stray too far afield alone is even more\nhazardous.  Successful vaudeville writers are much like a band of\nIndians marching through an enemy’s country–they follow one another\nin single file, stepping in each other’s footprints.  In other\nwords, they obey the rules of their craft, but their mental strides,\nlike the Indians’ physical footsteps, are individual and distinct.",

        "There are two other important items in human nature that we have\n  capitalized along with others to large profit.  Human nature,\n  according to the way we analyzed it, is such a curious thing\n  that it will invariably find cause for extreme mirth in seeing\n  some other fellow being made a fool of, no matter who that fellow\n  may be, and in seeing a man betting on a proposition when he\n  cannot possibly win.  We figured it out, in the first place,\n  that nothing pleased a man much more than when he saw another\n  man being made to look silly in the eyes of others.",

        "Note how the “fool” theme runs all through “The Art of Flirtation.\"\nGo to see as many two-acts as you can and you will find that one\nor another of the characters is always trying to “show up” the\nother.",
        "(c) The “Sucker” Theme.",
        " As for the quirk in human nature that shows great gratification\n  at the sight of a man betting on something where he is bound to\n  be the loser:  in inelegant language, this relates simply to the\n  universal impulse to laugh at a “sucker.”  It is just like\n  standing in front of a sideshow tent after you have paid your\n  good money, gone in, and been “stung,” and laughing at everyone\n  else who pays his good money, comes out, and has been equally\n  “stung.”  You laugh at a man when he loses the money he has bet\n  on a race that has already been run when the wager has been\n  posted.  You laugh at a man who bets a man ten dollars “receive\"\n  is spelled “recieve,” when you have just looked at the\n  dictionary and appreciate that he hasn’t a chance. . . .  Comedy\n  that lives year after year–no matter whether you choose to call\n  it “refined” or not–never comes to its exploiters by accident.\n  The intrinsic idea, the germ, may come accidentally; but the\n  figuring out of the elaboration and execution of the comedy takes\n  thinking and a pretty fair knowledge of your fellow men. [1]",
        "[1] From the Weber and Fields article.",
        "Although there are very many two-acts–among them “The Art of\nFlirtation\"–which do not make use of this third fundamental theme,\nthere are a great many that depend for their biggest laughs upon\nthis sure-fire subject.",

        "Anything that admits of treatment on the lines of the two-act as\nit has been spread before you, offers itself as a subject theme.\nIn the degree that you can find in it points that are bright,\nclever, laughter-provoking and business-suggestive, does it recommend\nitself to you as a theme.",
        "Here is the merest skimming of the themes of the two-acts presented\nin one large city during one week:",
        "Flirting:  done in a burlesque way.  Our own example, “The Art of\nFlirtation.”",

        "Note the variety of subjects treated.  If my memory serves me\ncorrectly, everyone of these acts had a quarrel either as its\nentire subject, or the usual quarrels developed frequently in the\nroutine.  These quarrels, as in most two-acts, were fundamental\nto much of their humor.  But no two of the acts had the same subject\ntheme.",
        "It would seem, then, that in thinking out the two-act, the author\nwould do well to avoid every theme that has been used–if such a\nthing is humanly possible, where everything seems to have been\ndone–and to attempt, at least, to bring to his two-act a new\nsubject theme.",
        "But if this is impossible, the writer should bring to the old theme\na new treatment.  Indeed, a new treatment with all its charm of\nnovelty will make any old theme seem new.  One of the standard\nrecipes for success in any line of endeavor is:  “Find out what\nsomebody else has done, and then do that thing–better.”  And one\nof the ways of making an old theme appear new, is to invest it\nwith the different personalities of brand new characters.",
        "From the time when vaudeville first emerged as a commanding new\nform of entertainment, distinct from its progenitor, the legitimate\nstage, and its near relatives, burlesque and musical comedy, there\nhave been certain characters indissolubly associated with the\ntwo-act.  Among them are the Irish character, or “Tad\"; the German,\nor “Dutch,” as they are often misnamed; the “black-face,” or\n\"Nigger\"; the farmer, or “Rube\"; the Swedish, or “Swede\"; the\nItalian, or “Wop\"; and the Hebrew, or “Jew.”",
        "Not much chance for a new character, you will say–but have you\nthought about the different combinations you can make?  There is\na wealth of ready humor waiting not only in varying combinations,\nbut in placing the characters in new businesses.  For example,\ndoesn’t a “Jew” aviator who is pestered by an insurance agent or\nan undertaker, strike you as offering amusing possibilities?",
        "But don’t sit right down and think out your two-act on the lines\nof the combination I have suggested on the spur of the moment.\nOthers are sure to be ahead of you.  You can only win success with\nnew characters that are all your own.  Then you are likely to be\nthe first in the field.",
        "As a final warning, permit the suggestion that bizarre combinations\nof characters very probably will be difficult to sell.  Make your\ncombinations within the limits of plausibility, and use characters\nthat are seen upon the stage often enough to be hailed with at\nleast a pleasant welcome.",
        "The characters of the two-act are technically called the “comedian\"\nand the “straight-man.”  The comedian might better be called the\n\"laugh-man,” just as the straight is more clearly termed the\n\"feeder.”",
        "In the early days of the business the comedian was always\ndistinguishable by his comedy clothes.  One glance would tell you\nhe was the comical cuss.  The straight-man dressed like a “gent,\"\ndazzling the eyes of the ladies with his correct raiment.  From\nthis fact the names “comedian” and “straight” arose.",
        "But today you seldom can tell the two apart.  They do not dress\nextravagantly, either for comedy or for fashion effect.  They often\ndress precisely alike–that is, so far as telling their different\ncharacters is concerned.  Their difference in wealth and intelligence\nmay be reflected in their clothes, but only as such differences\nwould be apparent in real life.  Indeed, the aim today is to mimic\nreality in externals, precisely as the real characters themselves\nare impersonated in every shade of thought and artistic inflection\nof speech.  There are, to be sure, exceptions to this modern\ntendency.",
        "The original purposes of their stage names, however, remain as\ntrue today as they did when the two-act first was played.  The\ncomedian has nearly all the laugh lines and the straight-man feeds\nhim.",
        "Not only must you keep the characters themselves pure of any\nviolation of their unity, but you must also see to it that every\nbig laugh is given to the comedian.  If the comedian is the one\n\"getting the worst of it\"–as is almost invariably the case–he\nmust get the worst of it nearly every time.  But that does not\ninfluence the fact that he also gets almost all the laugh lines.",
        "Note the working out of the laugh lines in “The Art of Flirtation.\"\nYou will see that only on the rarest of occasions does the\nstraight-man have a funny line given him.",
        "The only time the feeder may be given a laugh line, is when the\nlaugh is what is called a “flash-back.”  For example, take the\npoint in “The Art of Flirtation” beginning:",

        "                   STRAIGHT",
        "  Yes, or she might answer you with an umbrella.",
        "This is a flash-back.  But, the comedian gets a bigger laugh on\nthe next line–worked up by a gesture:",
        "                   COMEDIAN Over the head.",
        "Or take this form of the flash-back, which may seem an even clearer\nexample:",

        "To your wife?  Any man can be disagreeable to his wife.  But\nthink–,",
        "and so on into the introduction to the next point.  It is always\na safe rule to follow that whenever you give the straight-man a\nflash-back, top it with a bigger laugh for the comedian.  How many\nflash-backs you may permit in your two-act, depends upon the\ncharacter of the material, and also varies according to the bigness\nof the roars that the business adds to the comedian’s laughs.  No\nstated rule can be given you.  In this, as in everything else, you\nmust carve your own way to win your own business.",
        "You have selected your theme, chosen your characters, thought out\nevery angle of business, and mapped nearly all of your points, as\nwell as your big laugh-lines:  now you are ready to put your two-act\non paper.  Before “taking your pen in hand,” stop for a moment of\nself-analysis.",
        "You can now determine how likely you are to succeed as a writer\nof the two-act, by this simple self-examination:",
        "How much of my two-act have I thought out clearly so that it is\nplaying before my very eyes?",
        "If you have thought it all out, so that every bit of business moves\nbefore your eyes, as every point rings in your ears, you are very\nlikely to turn out an acceptable two-act–if you have not played\na “chooser’s” part, and your points are real points.",
        "But do not imagine because you are positive that you have thought\neverything out beforehand, and now have come to writing it down,\nthat your job of thinking is ended.  Not at all; there are a few\nthings still to be thought out, while you are writing.",
        "As in the monologue–because your material is made up of points–you\nmay begin nearly anywhere to write your two-act.  And like the\nmonologue, you need not have a labored formal introduction.",
        "Still, your introduction is no less comprehensively informing\nbecause it has not the air of formality.  If your characters by\ntheir appearance stamp themselves for what they are, you may trust\ncomplete characterization–as you should in writing every form of\nstage material–to what each character does and says.",
        "But in your very first line you should subtly tell the audience,\nso there cannot possibly be any mistake, what your subject is.",
        "Why are those two men out there on the stage?",
        "What is the reason for their attitude toward each ther?",
        "If they are quarreling, why are they quarreling?",
        "If they are laughing, why are they laughing?",
        "But don’t make the mistake of trying to tell too much.  To do that,\nwould be to make your introduction draggy.  You must make the\naudience think the characters are bright–precisely as the\nintroduction of the monologue is designed to make the audience\nthink the monologist is bright.  Write your introduction in very\nshort speeches.  Show the attitude of the characters clearly and\nplainly, as the first speech of our two-act example shows the\ncharacters are quarreling:",
        "                        STRAIGHT",
        "  Say, whenever we go out together you always got a kick coming.\n  What’s the matter with you?",
        "Then get into your subject-theme quickly after you have given the\naudience time to get acquainted and settled, with the memory of\nthe preceding act dimmed in their minds by the giggle-points of\nyour introduction.",
        "The introduction of the two-act is designed to stamp the characters\nas real characters, to establish their relations to each other,\nto give the audience time to settle down to the new “turn,” to\nmake them think the performers are “bright” and to delay the first\nbig laugh until the psychological moment has come to spring the\ninitial big point of the subject theme, after the act has “got\"\nthe audience.",
        "It would seem needless to repeat what has already been stated so\nplainly in the chapters on the monologue, that no one can teach\nyou how to write excruciatingly funny points and gags, and that\nno one can give you the power to originate laughter-compelling\nsituations.  You must rise or fall by the force of your own ability.",
        "There are, however, two suggestions that can be given you for the\nproduction of a good two-act.  One is a “don’t,” and the other a\n\"do.”  Don’t write your points in the form of questions and answers.\nThe days of the “Why did the chicken cross the road?\"–\"Because\nshe wanted to get on the other side” sort of two-act, is past.\nWrite all your points in conversational style.",
        "Never write:",
        "What were you doing at Pat’s dinner lathering your face with a\n  charlotte russe?",
        "Write it:",
        "So you were down at Pat’s house for dinner, and you went and\n  lathered your face with a charlotte russe–I saw you.",
        "Of course when a legitimate question is to be asked, ask it.  But\ndo not deliberately throw your points into question form.  Your\nguide to the number of direct queries you would use should be the\nusual conversational methods of real life.",
        "Your subject, of course, in a large measure determines how many\nquestions you need to ask.  For instance, if your theme is one\nthat develops a lot of fun through one character instructing the\nother, a correspondingly large number of questions naturally would\nbe asked.  But, as “The Art of Flirtation” plainly shows, you can\nget a world of fun out of even an instruction theme, without the\nuse of a wearying number of inquiries.  The two-act fashion today\nis the direct, conversational style.",
        "Now for the second suggestion:",
        "Although some exceedingly successful two-acts have been written\nwith many themes scattered through their twelve or more minutes,\nprobably a larger number have won success through singleness of\nsubject.  A routine with but one subject worked up to its most\neffective height is often more likely to please.",
        "Furthermore, for the reason that the two-act is breaking away from\nthe offering that is merely pieced together out of successful\nbits–precisely as that class of act struggled away from the old\nslap-stick turn–the single-routine now finds readier sale.  The\npresent tendency of the two-act seems to be to present clever\ncharacterization–and so to win by artistic acting, as before it\nwon by cruder methods.",
        "Therefore, strive for unity of routine.  Treat but one subject and\namplify that one subject with singleness of purpose.",
        "The point, or the gag, of a two-act is very much like that of the\nmonologue.  In so far as construction is concerned–by this I mean\nlaugh-wave construction–they are identical.  Study “The Art of\nFlirtation,” and you will see how little laughs precede big laughs\nand follow after, mounting into still bigger laughs that rise into\nroars of laughter.",
        "If you were telling a joke to a friend you would be sure to tell\nhim in your very first sentence all the things he would need in\norder to understand the point of the joke, wouldn’t you?  You would\ntake great care not to leave out one salient bit of information\nthat would make him see the joke plainly–you would be as logical\nas though you were trying to sell him a bill of goods.  Take the\nsame attitude toward each point that you introduce into your\ntwo-act.  Remember, you are wholesaling your “jokes” to the\ncomedians, who must retail them to their audiences.  Therefore,\nintroduce each new point as clearly and as briefly as you can.",
        "Let us take a point from “The Art of Flirtation” and see how it\nis constructed.  The very first line the straight-man speaks when\nhe comes out on the stage unmistakably declares his relation to\nthe comedian.  When he shows the book, he explains precisely what\nit is.  And while laugh after laugh is worked out of it, the precise\nthings that the book teaches are made clear.",

It serves as an audience settler, gives\nemphasis to the explanation of just what the book tells and helps\nto blend into the next line.",
        "There’s a first laugh on, “For ten cents.”  A bigger laugh comes\non, “Run the other way.”  And the bigest–in this point-division–\non the third laugh line “And hold on to your money.”",
        "When you have a big laugh, you must make the next line carry you\non smoothly into the succeeding lint.  It matters not whether the\npoints are all related to the same general subject or not–although\nwe are considering here only the single-routine two-act–you must\ntake great care that each point blends into the following one with\nlogical sequence.",
        "The line, “Who wants to flirt with a handkerchief?  I want to flirt\nwith a woman,” helps in the blending of the point division we have\njust examined.",
        "The straight-man’s line following the big laugh line in that point\ndivision, “No, you take out your handkerchief,” (biz. [1]) is\nanother example of the blend-line.  And it is the very first\nintroduction of the peculiar style of business that makes of “The\nArt of Flirtation” so funny an act.",
        "[1] Biz. is often used in vaudeville material for bus., the\ncorrect contraction of business.",
        "Let us continue in the examination of this example.",
        "                         COMEDIAN",
        "  Suppose you ain’t got a handkerchief?\n\n                         STRAIGHT",
        "  Every flirter must have a handkerchief.  It says it in the book.\n  Now you shake the handkerchief three times like this.  (Biz) Do\n  you know what that means?",
        "                         COMEDIAN",
        "  (Biz. of shaking head.)",
        "                         STRAIGHT",
        "  That means you want her to give you–",
        "                         COMEDIAN\n\n  Ten cents.",
        "The reason why these two words come with such humorous effect,\nlies in two causes.  First, “ten cents” has been used before with\ngood laugh results–as a “gag line,” you recall–and this is the\ncomedian’s magical “third time” use of it.  It is a good example\nof the “three-sequence mystery” which Weber and Fields mentioned,\nand which has been used to advantage on the stage for many, many\nyears.",
        "Second, the comedian had refused to answer the straight-man’s\nquestion.  He simply stood there and shook his head.  It was the\nvery simple business of shaking his head that made his interruption\ncome as a surprise and gave perfect setting for the “gag-line.”",
        "Read the speeches that follow and you will see how business is\nused.  Note particularly how the business makes this point stand\nout as a great big laugh:",
        "                        STRAIGHT",
        "  . . .Den you hold your handkerchief by the comer like dis.",
        "                        COMEDIAN",
        "  Vat does that mean?",
        "                        STRAIGHT",
        "  Meet me on the corner.",
        "                        COMEDIAN",
        "  Och, dat’s fine.  (Takes handkerchief). . . Den if you hold it\n  dis way, dat means (biz.):  “Are you on the square?”",
        "This line reads even funnier than many laughs in the act that are\nbigger, but its business cannot be explained in words.  It seems\nfunnier to you because you can picture it.  You actually see it,\nprecisely as it is done.",
        "Then the next line blends it into the next point, which is clearly\nintroduced with a grin–is developed into a laugh, a bigger laugh\nby effective business, and then into a roar.",
        "Point after point follows–each point topping the preceding\npoint–until the end of the two-act is reached in the biggest laugh\nof all.",
        "The business of the two-act, which secures its effects by actions\nthat are often wholly without words, makes the two-act more difficult\nto time than a monologue.  Furthermore, even if the time-consuming\nbits of business were negligible, the precise timing of a two-act\nby the author is not really necessary.",
        "Precisely as a monologist can vary the length of his offering by\nleaving out gags, the two-act performers can shorten their offering\nat will–by leaving out points.  Hence it is much better to supply\nmore points than time will permit to delivery in the finished\nperformance, than to be required to rewrite your material to stretch\nthe subject to fill out time.  All you need do is to keep the\ntwo-act within, say, twenty minutes.  And to gauge the length\nroughly, count about one hundred and fifteen words to a minute.",
        "Therefore, having arranged your points upon separate cards, or\nslips of paper, and having shuffied them about and tried them all\nin various routines to establish the best, choose your very biggest\nlaugh for the last. [1] Wherever that biggest laugh may have been\nin the sample routines you have arranged, take it out and blend\nit in for your final big roar.",
        "[1] See description of card system, Chapter VI, section III.",
        "Remember that the last laugh must be the delighted roar that will\ntake the performers off stage, and bring them back again and again\nfor their bows.",
        "The manuscript of a two-act is only a prophecy of what may be.\nIt may be a good prophecy or a bad prognostication–only actual\nperformance before an audience can decide.  As we saw in the\nmonologue, points that the author thought would “go big\"–\"die\";\nand unexpectedly, little grins waken into great big laughs.  There\nis no way of telling from the manuscript.",
        "When you have finished your two-act you must be prepared to construct\nit all over again in rehearsal, and during all the performances\nof its try-out weeks.  Not only must the points be good themselves,\nthey must also fit the performers like the proverbial kid gloves.",
        "More two-acts–and this applies to all other stage-offerings as\nwell–have started out as merely promising successes, than have\nwon at the first try-out.  For this reason, be prepared to work\nall the morning rehearsing, at the matinee and the night performances,\nand after the theatre is dark, to conjure giggle points into great\nbig laughs, and lift the entire routine into the success your\nability and the performers’ cleverness can make it.",
        "Even after it has won its way into a contract and everybody is\nhappy, you must be prepared to keep your two-act up-to-the-minute.\nWhile it is on the road, you must send to the performers all the\nlaughs you can think of–particularly if you have chosen for your\ntheme one that demands constant furbishing to keep it bright.",
        "It is with direct purpose that the discussion of the two-act has\nbeen confined to the kind of act that Weber and Fields made so\nsuccessful–and of which Mr. Hoffman’s “The Art of Flirtation” is\na more up-to-date, mild and artistic form.  There are other forms\nof the two-act, of course, but the kind of two-act we have discussed\nis peculiarly typical of two-act material.  It holds within itself\npractically all the elements of the two-act that the writer has\nto consider.  It is only necessary now to describe the other forms\nbriefly.",
        "By “pure two-act form,” I mean the two-act that is presented without\nsongs, tricks, or any other entertainment elements.  Yet many of\nthe most successful two-acts open with a song, introduce songs or\nparodies into the middle of their dialogue, or close with a song\nor some novelty.",
        "Do not imagine that a two-act in which songs are introduced cannot\nbe precisely as good as one that depends upon its talk alone.  It\nmay be an even better act.  If it pleases the audience better, it\nis a better act.  Remember that while we have been discussing the\ntwo-act from the writer’s view-point, it is the applause of the\naudience that stamps every act with the final seal of approval.\nBut, whether a two-act makes use of songs or tricks or anything\nelse, does not change the principles on which all two-act points\nand gags are constructed.",
        "The more common talking two-acts are:",
        "This form may or may not open and close with songs, and depends\nupon skillfully blended, but not necessarily related, gags and\njokes.",
        "This sort of act opens and closes with parodies on the latest\nsong-hits, and uses talk for short rests and humorous effect between\nthe parodies by which the act makes its chief appeal.",
        "This type makes its appeal not by the use of songs, but because\nthe voices are very fine.  Such an act may use a few gags and\nunrelated jokes–perhaps of the “nut” variety–to take the act out\nof the pure duet class and therefore offer wider appeal.",
        "Such acts may depend on precisely the same form of routine the\npure talking two-act for men uses.  Of course, the treatment of\nthe subject themes is gentler and the material is all of a milder\ncharacter.",
        "Acts of this character make use of a comedy, burlesque, melodramatic\nor even a dramatic plot.  This form of sketch seldom rises into\nthe playlet class.  It is a two-act merely because it is played\nby two persons.  Often, however, this form of the two-act uses a\nthread of plot on which to string its business and true two-act\npoints.  It may or may not make use of songs, parodies, tricks or\nother entertainment elements.  We have now come to a form of two-act\nwhich is of so popular a nature that it requires more than passing\nmention.  This is",
        "Usually presented with songs making their appeal to sentiment,\nalmost always marked by at least one change of costume by the\nwoman, sometimes distinguished by a special drop and often given\nmore than a nucleus of plot, this very popular form of two-act\nsometimes rises into the dignity of a little production.  Indeed,\nmany two-acts of this kind have been so successful in their little\nform they have been expanded into miniature musical comedies [1].",
        "[1] See Chapter XXX, The One-Act Musical Comedy.",
        "(a) Romance is the chief source of the flirtation two-act’s\nappeal.  It is the dream-love in the heart of every person in the\naudience which makes this form of two-act “go” so well.  Moonlight,\na girl and a man–this is the recipe.",
        "(b) Witty Dialogue that fences with love, that thrusts, parries\nand–surrenders, is what makes the flirtation two-act “get over.\"\nIt is the same kind of dialogue that made Anthony Hope’s “Dolly\nDialogues” so successful in their day, the sort of speeches which\nwe, in real life, think of afterward and wish we had made.",
        "(c) Daintiness of effect is what is needed in this form of\ntwo-act.  Dialogue and business, scenery, lights and music all\ncombine to the fulfillment of its purpose.  The cruder touches of\nother two-act forms are forgotten and the entire effort is\nconcentrated on making an appeal to the “ideal.”  Turn to the\nAppendix, and read “After the Shower,” and you will see how these\nvarious elements are unified.  This famous flirtation two-act has\nbeen chosen because it shows practically all the elements we have\ndiscussed.",
        "The playlet is a very definite thing–and yet it is difficult to\ndefine.  Like the short-story, painting as we know it today,\nphotography, the incandescent lamp, the telephone, and the myriad\nother forms of art and mechanical conveniences, the playlet did\nnot spring from an inventor’s mind full fledged, but attained its\npresent form by slow growth.  It is a thing of life–and life\ncannot be bounded by words, lest it be buried in the tomb of a\nhasty definition.",
        "To attempt even the most cautious of definitions without having\nfirst laid down the foundations of understanding by describing\nsome of the near-playlet forms to be seen on many vaudeville bills\nwould, indeed, be futile.  For perhaps the surest way of learning\nwhat a thing is, is first to learn what it is not.  Confusion is\nthen less likely to creep into the conception, and the definition\ncomes like a satisfactory summing up of familiar points that are\nresolved into clear words.",
        "Even in the old music hall days, when a patron strolled in from a\nhard day’s work and sat down to enjoy an even harder evening’s\nentertainment, the skit or sketch or short play which eventually\ndrifted upon the boards–where it was seen through the mists of\ntobacco smoke and strong drink–was the thing.  The admiration\nthe patrons had for the performers, whom they liberally treated\nafter the show, did not prevent them from actively driving from\nthe stage any offering that did not possess the required dramatic\n\"punch.” [1] They had enjoyed the best of everything else the music\nhall manager could obtain for their amusement and they demanded\nthat their bit of a play be, also, the very best of its kind.",
        "[1] It is worthy of note in this connection that many of the\ndramatic and particularly the comedy offerings seen in the music\nhalls of twenty years ago, and in the “Honkitonks” of Seattle and\nother Pacific Coast cities during the Alaskan gold rush, have,\nexpurgated, furnished the scenarios of a score of the most successful\nlegitimate dramas and comedies of recent years.  Some of our\ngreatest legitimate and vaudeville performers also came from this\nhumble and not-to-be-boasted-of school.  This phase of the growth\nof the American drama has never been written.  It should be recorded\nwhile the memories of “old timers” are still fresh.",
        "No matter what this form of entertainment that we now know by the\nname of vaudeville may be called, the very essence of its being\nis variety.  “Topical songs\"–we call their descendants “popular\nsongs\"–classic ballads, short concerts given on all sorts of\ninstruments, juggling, legerdermain, clowning, feats of balancing,\nall the departments of dancing and of acrobatic work, musical\ncomedy, pantomime, and all the other hundred-and-one things that\nmay be turned into an amusing ten or twenty minutes, found eager\nwelcome on the one stage that made it, and still makes it, a\nbusiness to present the very newest and the very best of everything.\nTo complete its claim to the title of variety, to separate itself\nfrom a likeness to the circus, to establish itself as blood brother\nof the legitimate stage, and, most important of all, to satisfy\nthe craving of its audiences for drama, vaudeville tried many\nforms of the short play before the playlet was evolved to fill the\nwant.",
        "Everything that bears even the remotest likeness to a play found\na place and had a more or less fleeting–or lasting–popularity.\nAnd not only was every form of play used, but forms of entertainment\nthat could not by reason of their very excellencies be made to\nfill the crying want, were pressed into service and supplied with\nill-fitting plots in the vain attempt.",
        "Musical acts, whose chief appeal was the coaxing of musical sounds\nfrom wagon tires, drinking glasses, and exotic instruments, were\nstaged in the kitchen set.  And father just home from work would\nsay, “Come, daughter, let’s have a tune.”  Then off they would\nstart, give their little entertainment, and down would come the\ncurtain on a picture of never-to-be-seen domestic life.  Even\ntoday, we sometimes see such a hybrid act.",
        "Slap-stick sidewalk conversation teams often would hire an author\nto fit them with a ready-made plot, and, pushed back behind the\nOlio into a centre-door fancy set, would laboriously explain why\nthey were there, then go through their inappropriate antics and\nfinish with a climax that never “climaxed.”  All kinds of two-acts,\nfrom the dancing pair to the flirtatious couple, vainly tried to\ngive their offerings dramatic form.  They did their best to make\nthem over into little plays and still retain the individual elements\nthat had won them success.",
        "The futility of such attempts it took years to realize.  It was\nonly when the stock opening, “I expect a new partner to call at\nthe house today in answer to my advertisement (which was read for\na laugh) and while I am waiting for him I might as well practice\nmy song,” grew so wearisome that it had to be served with a special\nnotice in many vaudeville theatres, that these groping two-acts\nreturned to the pure forms from which they never should have\nstrayed.  But even today you sometimes see such an act–with a\nlittle less inappropriate opening–win, because of the extreme\ncleverness of the performers.",
        "Among the dramatic forms–by which I mean acts depending on dialogue,\nplot and “acting” for appeal–that found more or less success in\nvaudeville, were sketches and short plays (not playlets) using\neither comedy, farce, or dramatic plots, and containing either\nburlesque or extravaganza.  Let us take these dramatic forms in\ntheir order of widest difference from the playlet and give to each\nthe explanatory word it deserves.",
        "Extravaganza is anything out of rule.  It deals comically with the\nimpossible and the unreal, and serves its purpose best when it\namazes most.  Relying upon physical surprises, as well as extravagant\nstage-effects, the extravaganza act may be best explained, perhaps,\nby naming a famous example–\"Eight Bells.”  The Byrne Brothers\ntook the elements of this entertainment so often into\nvaudeville and out of it again into road shows that it is difficult\nto remember where it originated.  The sudden appearances of the\nacrobatic actors and their amazing dives through seemingly solid\ndoors and floors, held the very essence of extravaganza.  Uncommon\nnowadays even in its pure form, the extravaganza act that tries\nto ape the play form is seldom if ever seen.",
        "Burlesque acts, however, are not uncommon today and are of two\ndifferent kinds.  First, there is the burlesque that is travesty,\nwhich takes a well-known and often serious subject and hits off\nits famous features in ways that are uproariously funny.  “When\nCaesar Sees Her,” took the famous meeting between Cleopatra and\nMarc Antony and made even the most impressive moment a scream. [1]\nAnd Arthur Denvir’s “The Villain Still Pursued Her” (See Appendix),\nan exceptionally fine example of the travesty, takes the well-\nremembered melodrama and extracts laughter from situations that\nonce thrilled.",
        "[1] In musical comedy this is often done to subjects and personalities\nof national interest.  The Ziegfeld perennial Follies invariably\nhave bits that are played by impersonators of the national figure\nof the moment.  Sometimes in musical revues great dramatic successes\nare travestied, and the invariable shouts of laughter their\npresentation provokes are an illuminating exemplification of the\ntruth that between tragedy and comedy there is but a step.",
        "Second, there are the acts that are constructed from bits of comedy\nbusiness and depend for their success not on dialogue, but on\naction.  Merely a thread of plot holds them together and on it is\nstrung the elemental humor of the comedy bits, which as often as\nnot may be slap-stick.  The purpose being only to amuse for the\nmoment, all kinds of entertainment forms may be introduced.  One\nof the most successful examples of the burlesque tab, [2] James\nMadison’s “My Old Kentucky Home” (See Appendix), serves as the\nbasic example in my treatment of this vaudeville form.",
        "[2] Tab is short for tabloid.  There may be tabloid musical\ncomedies–running forty minutes or more–as well as burlesque\ntabs.",
        "Short plays, as the name implies, are merely plays that are short.\nThey partake of the nature of the long play and are simply short\nbecause the philosophic speeches are few and the number of scenes\nthat have been inserted are not many.  The short play may have\nsub-plots; it may have incidents that do not affect the main design;\nits characters may be many and some may be introduced simply to\nachieve life-like effect; and it usually comes to a leisurely end\nafter the lapse of from twenty minutes to even an hour or more.",
        "Again like the full-evening play, the one-act play that is merely\nshort paints its characters in greater detail than is possible in\nthe playlet, where the strokes are made full and broad.  Furthermore,\nwhile in the playlet economy of time and attention are prime\nrequisites, in the short play they are not; to take some of the\nincidents away from the short play might not ruin it, but to take\neven one incident away from a playlet would make it incomplete.",
        "For many years, however, the following tabloid forms of the\nlegitimate drama were vaudeville’s answer to the craving of its\naudiences for drama.",
        "(a) Condensed Versions, “Big” Scenes and Single Acts of Long\nPlays.  For example–an example which proves three points in a\nsingle instance:  the need for drama in vaudeville, vaudeville’s\nanxiety for names, and its willingness to pay great sums for what\nit wants–Joseph Jefferson was offered by F. F.  Proctor, in 1905,\nthe then unheard-of salary of $5,000 a week for twelve consecutive\nweeks to play “Bob Acres” in a condensed version of “The Rivals.\"\nMr. Jefferson was to receive this honorarium for himself alone,\nMr. Proctor agreeing to furnish the condensed play, the scenery\nand costumes, and pay the salaries of the supporting cast.  The\noffer was not accepted, but it stood as the record until Martin\nBeck paid Sarah Bernhardt the sum of $7,500 a week for herself and\nsupporting players during her famous 1913 tour of the Orpheum\nCircuit.  In recent years nearly every legitimate artist of national\nand international reputation has appeared in vaudeville in some\nsort of dramatic vehicle that had a memory in the legitimate.",
        "But that neither a condensed play, nor one “big” scene or a single\nact from a long play, is not a playlet should be apparent when you\nremember the impression of inadequacy left on your own mind by\nsuch a vehicle, even when a famous actor or actress has endowed\nit with all of his or her charm and wonderful art.",
        "(b) The Curtain-Raiser.  First used to supplement or preface a\nshort three-act play so as to eke out a full evening’s entertainment,\nthe little play was known as either an “afterpiece” or a\n\"curtain-raiser\"; usually, however, it was presented before the\nthree-act drama, to give those who came early their full money’s\nworth and still permit the fashionables, who “always come late,\"\nto be present in time to witness the important play of the evening.\nThen it was that “curtain-raiser” was considered a term of reproach.\nBut often in these days a curtain-raiser, like Sir James M. Barrie’s\n\"The Twelve Pound Look,” proves even more entertaining and worth\nwhile than the ambitious play it precedes.",
        "That Ethel Barrymore took “The Twelve Pound Look” into vaudeville\ndoes not prove, however, that the curtain-raiser and the vaudeville\nplaylet are like forms.  As in the past, the curtain-raiser of\ntoday usually is more kin to the long play than to the playlet.\nBut it is nevertheless true that in some recent curtain-raisers\nthe compact swiftness and meaningful effect of the playlet form\nhas become more apparent–they differ from the vaudeville playlet\nless in form than in legitimate feeling.",
        "Historically, however, the curtain-raiser stands in much the same\nposition in the genealogy of the playlet that the forms discussed\nin the preceding section occupy.  As in the other short plays,\nthere was no sense of oneness of plot and little feeling of\ncoming-to-the-end that mark a good playlet.",
        "Therefore, since the short play could not fully satisfy the\nvaudeville patron’s natural desire for drama, the sketch held the\nvaudeville stage unchallenged until the playlet came.",
        "The vaudeville sketch in the old days was almost anything you might\ncare to name, in dramatic form.  Any vaudeville two-act that stepped\nbehind the Olio and was able to hold a bit of a plot alive amid\nits murdering of the King’s English and its slap-stick ways, took\nthe name of “a sketch.”  But the “proper sketch,” as the English\nwould say–the child of vaudeville and elder half-brother to the\nplaylet–did not make use of other entertainment forms.  It depended\non dialogue, business and acting and a more or less consistent\nplot or near-plot for its appeal.  Usually a comedy–yet sometimes\na melodrama–the vaudeville sketch of yesterday and of today rarely\nmakes plot a chief element.  The story of a sketch usually means\nlittle in its general effect.  The general effect of the sketch\nis–general.  That is one of the chief differences between it and\nthe playlet.",
        "The purpose of the sketch is not to leave a single impression of\na single story.  It points no moral, draws no conclusion, and\nsometimes it might end quite as effectively anywhere before the\nplace in the action at which it does terminate.  It is built for\nentertainment purposes only, and furthermore, for entertainment\npurposes that end the moment the sketch ends.  When you see a\nsketch you carry away no definite impression, save that of\nentertainment, and usually you cannot remember what it was that\nentertained you.  Often a sketch might be incorporated into a\nburlesque show or a musical comedy and serve for part of an act,\nwithout suffering, itself, in effect. [1] And yet, without the\nsketch of yesterday there would be no playlet today.",
        "[1] Not so many years ago, a considerable number of vaudeville\nsketches were used in burlesque; and vice versa, many sketches\nwere produced in burlesque that afterward had successful runs in\nvaudeville.  Yet they were more than successful twenty-minute\n\"bits,” taken out of burlesque shows.  They had a certain completeness\nof form which did not lose in effect by being transplanted.",
        "(a) The Character Sketch.  Some sketches, like Tom Nawn’s “Pat\nand the Geni,” and his other “Pat” offerings, so long a famous\nvaudeville feature, are merely character sketches.  Like the\nnear-short-story character-sketch, the vaudeville sketch often\ngives an admirable exposition of character, without showing any\nchange in the character’s heart effected by the incidents of the\nstory.  “Pat” went through all sorts of funny and startling\nadventures when he opened the brass bottle and the Geni came forth,\nbut he was the very same Pat when he woke up and found it all a\ndream. [1]",
        "[1] The Ryan and Richfield acts that have to do with Haggerty and\nhis society-climbing daughter Mag, may be remembered.  For longer\nthan my memory runs, Mag Haggerty has been trying to get her father\ninto society, but the Irish brick-layer will never “arrive.”  The\nhumor lies in Haggerty’s rich Irishness and the funny mistakes he\nalways makes.  The “Haggerty” series of sketches and the “Pat\"\nseries show, perhaps better than any others, the closeness of the\ncharacter-sketch short-story that is often mistaken for the true\nshort-story, to the vaudeville sketch that is so often considered\na playlet.",
        "Indeed, the vaudeville sketch was for years the natural vehicle\nand “artistic reward” for clever actors who made a marked success\nin impersonating some particular character in burlesque or in the\nlegitimate.  The vaudeville sketch was written around the personality\nof the character with which success had been won and hence was\nconstructed to give the actor opportunity to show to the best\nadvantage his acting in the character.  And in the degree that it\nsucceeded it was and still is a success–and a valuable entertainment\nform for vaudeville.",
        "(b) The Narrative Sketch.  Precisely as the character sketch is\nnot a playlet, the merely narrative sketch is not a true playlet.\nNo matter how interesting and momentarily amusing or thrilling may\nbe the twenty-minute vaudeville offering that depends upon incident\nonly, it does not enlist the attention, hold the sympathy, or\nlinger in the memory, as does the playlet.",
        "Character revelation has little place in the narrative sketch, a\ncomplete well-rounded plot is seldom to be found, and a change in\nthe relations of the characters rarely comes about.  The sketch\ndoes not convince the audience that it is complete in itself–rather\nit seems an incident taken out of the middle of a host of similar\nexperiences.  It does not carry the larger conviction of reality\nthat lies behind reality.",
        "(1) The Farce Sketch.  Nevertheless such excellent farce sketches\nas Mr. and Mrs. Sydney Drew, Rice and Cohen, Homer Mason and\nMargaret Keeler, and other sterling performers have presented in\nvaudeville, are well worth while.  The fact that many of the minor\nincidents that occur in such finely amusing sketches as Mason and\nKeeler’s “In and Out” [1] do not lend weight to the ending, but\nseem introduced merely to heighten the cumulative effect of the\nfarce-comedy, does not prove them, or the offering, to be lacking\nin entertainment value for vaudeville.  Rather, the use of just\nsuch extraneous incidents makes these sketches more worth while;\nbut the introduction of them and the dependence upon them, for\ninterest, does mark such offerings as narrative sketches rather\nthan as true playlets.",
        "[1] By Porter Emerson Brown, author of A Fool There Was, and other\nfull-evening plays.",
        "(2) The Straight Dramatic and Melodramatic Sketch.  In identically\nthe same way the introduction into one-act dramas and melodramas\nof “bits” that are merely added to heighten the suspense and make\nthe whole seem more “creepy,” without having a definite–an\ninevitable–effect upon the ending makes and marks them as narrative\ndramas and melodramas and not true playlet forms.",
        "From the foregoing examples we may now attempt",
        "A Vaudeville Sketch is a simple narrative, or a character sketch,\n  presented by two or more people, requiring usually about twenty\n  minutes to act, having little or no definite plot, developing\n  no vital change in the relations of the characters, and depending\n  on effective incidents for its appeal, rather than on the\n  singleness of effect of a problem solved by character revelation\n  and change.",
        "It must be borne in mind that vaudeville is presenting today all\nsorts of sketches, and that nothing in this definition is levelled\nagainst their worth.  All that has been attempted so far in this\nchapter has been to separate for you the various forms of dramatic\nand near-dramatic offerings to be seen in vaudeville.  A good\nsketch is decidedly worth writing.  And you should also remember\nthat definitions and separations are dangerous things.  There are\nvaudeville sketches that touch in one point or two or three the\npeculiar requirements of the playlet and naturally, in proportion\nas these approach closely the playlet form, hair-splitting separations\nbecome nearly, if not quite, absurd.",
        "Furthermore, when an experienced playwright sits down to write a\nvaudeville offering he does not consider definitions.  He has in\nhis mind something very definite that he plans to produce and he\nproduces it irrespective of definitions.  He is not likely to stop\nto inquire whether it is a sketch or a playlet. [1] The only\nclassifications the professional vaudeville writer considers, are\nfailures and successes.  He defines a success by the money it\nbrings him.",
        "[1] In discussing this, Arthur Hopkins said:  “When vaudeville\npresents a very good dramatic offering, ’playlet’ is the word used\nto describe it.  If it isn’t very fine, it is called a ’sketch.’”",
        "But today there is a force abroad in vaudeville that is making for\na more artistic form of the one-act play.  It is the same artistic\nspirit that produced out of short fiction the short-story.  This\nage has been styled the age of the short-story and of vaudeville–it\nis, indeed, the age of the playlet.",
        "The actor looking for a vaudeville vehicle today is not content\nwith merely an incident that will give him the opportunity to\npresent the character with which he has won marked success on the\nlegitimate stage.  Nor is he satisfied with a series of incidents,\nhowever amusing or thrilling they may be.  He requires an offering\nthat will lift his work into a more artistic sphere.  He desires\na little play that will be remembered after the curtain has been\nrung down.",
        "This is the sort of vehicle that he must present to win success\nin vaudeville for any length of time.  While vaudeville managers\nmay seem content to book an act that is not of the very first rank,\nbecause it is played by someone whose ability and whose name glosses\nover its defects, they do not encourage such offerings by long\ncontracts.  Even with the most famous of names, vaudeville\nmanagers–reflecting the desires of their audiences–demand\nacceptable playlets.",
        "Edgar Allan Woolf, one of the day’s most successful playlet writers\nwho has won success year after year with vaudeville offerings that\nhave been presented by some of the most famous actors of this\ncountry and of England, said when I asked him what he considered\nto be the difference between the sketch and the playlet:",
        "“There was a time when the vaudeville sketch was moulded on lines\nthat presented less difficulties and required less technique of\nthe playwright than does the playlet of today.  The curtain generally\nrose on a chambermaid in above-the-ankle skirts dusting the furniture\nas she told in soliloquy form that her master and mistress had\nsent for a new butler or coachman or French teacher.  How the\nbutler, coachman or French teacher might make her happier was not\ndisclosed.",
        "“Then came a knock on the door, followed by the elucidating remark\nof the maid, ’Ah, this must be he now.’ A strange man thereupon\nentered, who was not permitted to say who he was till the piece\nwas over or there would have been no piece.  The maid for no reason\nmistook him for the butler, coachman or French teacher, as the\ncase may have been, and the complications ensuing were made hilarious\nby the entrance of the maid’s husband who, of course, brought about\na comedy chase scene, without which no ’comedietta’ was complete.\nThen all characters met–hasty explanations–and ’comedy curtain.’",
        "“Today, all these things are taboo.  A vaudeville audience resents\nhaving the ’protiasis’ or introductory facts told them in monologue\nform, as keenly as does the ’legitimate’ audience.  Here, too, the\nactor may not explain his actions by ’asides.’ And ’mistaken\nidentity’ is a thing of the past.",
        "“Every trivial action must be thoroughly motivated, and the finish\nof the playlet, instead of occurring upon the ’catabasis,’ or\ngeneral windup of the action, must develop the most striking feature\nof the playlet, so that the curtain may come down on a surprise,\nor at least an event toward which the entire action has been\nprogressing.",
        "“But the most important element that has developed in the playlet\nof today is the problem, or theme.  A little comedy that provokes\nlaughter yet means nothing, is apt to be peddled about from week\nto week on the ’small time’ and never secure booking in the better\nhouses.  In nearly all cases where the act has been a ’riot’ of\nlaughter, yet has failed to secure bookings, the reason is to be\nfound in the fact that it is devoid of a definite theme or central\nidea.",
        "“The booking managers are only too eager to secure playlets–and\nnow I mean precisely the playlet–which are constructed to develop\na problem, either humorous or dramatic.  The technique of the\nplaylet playwright is considered in the same way that the three-act\nplaywright’s art of construction is analyzed by the dramatic\ncritic.”",
        "We have seen what the playlet is not.  We have considered the\nvarious dramatic and near-dramatic forms from which it differs.\nAnd now, having studied its negative qualities, I may assemble its\npositive characteristics before we embark once more upon the\ntroubled seas of definition.  The true playlet is marked by the\nfollowing ten characteristics:",
        "1–A clearly motivated opening–not in soliloquy form.",
        "2–A single definite and predominating problem or theme.",
        "3–A single preeminent character.",
        "4–Motivated speeches.",
        "5–Motivated business and acting.",
        "6–Unity of characters.",
        "7–Compression.",
        "8–Plot.",
        "9–A finish that develops the most striking feature into a\nsurprise–or is an event toward which every speech and every action\nhas been progressing.",
        "10–Unity of impression [1]",
        "[1] See page 30, Writing the Short-Story, by J. Berg Esenwein,\npublished in “The Writer’s Library,” uniform with this volume.\nNote the seven characteristics of the short-story and compare them\nwith the playlet’s ten characteristics.  You will find a surprising\nsimilarity between the short-story and the playlet in some points\nof structure.  A study of both in relation to each other may give\nyou a clearer understanding of each.",
        "Each of these characteristics has already been discussed in our\nconsideration of the dramatic forms–either in its negative or\npositive quality–or will later be taken up at length in its proper\nplace.  Therefore, we may hazard in the following words",
        "A Playlet is a stage narrative taking usually about twenty minutes\n  to act, having a single chief character, and a single problem\n  which predominates, and is developed by means of a plot so\n  compressed and so organized that every speech and every action\n  of the characters move it forward to a finish which presents the\n  most striking features; while the whole is so organized as to\n  produce a single impression.",
        "You may haunt the vaudeville theatres in a vain search for a playlet\nthat will embody all of these characteristics in one perfect\nexample. [1] But the fact that a few playlets are absolutely perfect\ntechnically is no reason why the others should be condemned.\nRemember that precise conformity to the rules here laid down is\nmerely academic perfection, and that the final worth of a playlet\ndepends not upon adherence to any one rule, or all–save as they\npoint the way to success–but upon how the playlet as a whole\nsucceeds with the audience.",
        "[1] Study the playlet examples in the Appendix and note how closely\neach approaches technical perfection.",
        "Yet there will be found still fewer dramatic offerings in vaudeville\nthat do not conform to some of these principles.  Such near-playlets\nsucceed not because they evade the type, but mysteriously in spite\nof their mistakes.  And as they conform more closely to the standards\nof what a playlet should be, they approach the elements that make\nfor lasting success.",
        "But beyond these “rules\"–if rules there really are–and far above\nthem in the heights no rules can reach, lies that something which\ncannot be defined, which breathes the breath of life into words\nand actions that bring laughter and tears.  Rules cannot build the\nbridge from your heart to the hearts of your audiences.  Science\nstands abashed and helpless before the task.  All that rules can\nsuggest, all that science can point out–is the way others have\nbuilt their bridges",
        "For this purpose only, are these standards of any value to you.",
        "The kind of playlet is largely determined by its characters and\ntheir surroundings, and on these there are practically no limits.\nYou may have characters of any nationality; you may treat them\nreverently, or–save that you must never offend–you may make them\nas funny as you desire; you may give them any profession that suits\nyour purpose; you may place them in any sort of house or on the\nopen hills or in an air-ship high in the sky; you may show them\nin any country of the earth or on the moon or in the seas under\nthe earth–you may do anything you like with them.  Vaudeville\nwants everything–everything so long as it is well and strikingly\ndone.  Therefore, to attempt to list the many different kinds of\nplaylet to be seen upon the vaudeville stage would, indeed, be a\ntask as fraught with hazard as to try to classify minutely the\ndivers kinds of men seen upon the stage of life.  And of just as\nlittle practical value would it be to have tables showing the\nscores of superficial variations of character, nationality, time\nand place which the years have woven into the playlets of the past.",
        "In the “art” of the playlet there are, to be sure, the same three\n\"schools\"–more or less unconsciously followed in nearly every\nvaudeville instance–which are to be found in the novel, the\nshort-story, painting, and the full-length play.  These are, of\ncourse, realism, romance, and idealism. [1] These distinctions,\nhowever, are–in vaudeville–merely distinctions without being\nvaluable differences.  You need never give thought as to the school\nto which you are paying allegiance in your playlet; your work will\nprobably be neither better nor worse for this knowledge or its\nlack.  Your playlet must stand on its own legs, and succeed or\nfail by the test of interest.  Make your playlet grip, that is the\nthing.",
        "[1] Should you wish to dally with the mooted question of the\ndifference between realism and romanticism–in the perplexing mazes\nof which many a fine little talent has been snuffed out like a\nflickering taper in a gust of wind–there are a score or more\nvolumes that you will find in any large library, in which the whole\nmatter is thrashed out unsatisfactorily.  However, if you wish to\nspend a half-hour profitably and pleasantly, read Robert Louis\nStevenson’s short chapter, A Note on Realism, to be found in his\nsuggestive and all-too-few papers on The Art of Writing.  In the\ncollection of his essays entitled Memories and Portraits will be\nfound an equally delightful and valuable paper, A Gossip on Romance.\nA brief technical discussion will also be found in Writing the\nShort-Story, by J. Berg Esenwein, pp. 64-67.",
        "But do not confuse the word “romance,” as it is used in the preceding\nparagraph, with love.  Love is an emotional, not a technical\nelement, and consorts equally well with either romance or realism\nin writing.  Love might be the heading of one of those tables we\nhave agreed not to bother with.  Into everything that is written\nfor vaudeville love may stray.  Or it may not intrude, if your\npurpose demands that love stay out.  Yet, like the world, what\nwould vaudeville be, if love were left out?  And now we come to\nthose broad types of playlet which you should recognize instinctively.\nUnless you do so recognize them–and the varying half-grounds that\nlie between, where they meet and mingle quite as often as they\nappear in their pure forms–you will have but little success in\nwriting the playlet.",
        "In considering the broad types of playlet you should remember that\nwords are said to denote definitely the ideas they delineate,\nand to connote the thoughts and emotions they do not clearly\nexpress but arouse in the hearer or reader.  For example, what do\n\"farce,” “comedy,” “tragedy” and “melodrama” connote to you?\nWhat emotions do they suggest?  This is an important matter, because\nall great artistic types are more or less fully associated with a\nmood, a feeling, an atmosphere.",
        "Webster’s dictionary gives to them the following denotations, or\ndefinitions:",
        "Farce:  “A dramatic composition, written without regularity, and\ndiffering from comedy chiefly in the grotesqueness, extravagance\nand improbability of its characters and incidents; low comedy.”",
        "Arthur Denvir’s “The Villain Still Pursued Her” is one of the\nbest examples of the travesty vaudeville has produced. [1] James\nMadison’s “My Old Kentucky Home” is a particularly fine example\nof burlesque in tabloid form. [1] These two acts have been chosen\nto show the difference between two of the schools of farce.",
        "[1] See Appendix.",
        "Comedy:  “A dramatic composition or representation, designed for\npublic amusement and usually based upon laughable incidents, or\nthe follies or foibles of individuals or classes; a form of the\ndrama in which humor and mirth predominate, and the plot of which\nusually ends happily; the opposite of tragedy.”",
        "Edgar Allan Woolf’s “The Lollard” is an exceptionally good example\nof satirical comedy. [1]",
        "Tragedy:  “A dramatic composition, representing an important event\nor a series of events in the life of some person or persons in\nwhich the diction is elevated, the movement solemn and stately,\nand the catastrophe sad; a kind of drama of a lofty or mournful\ncast, dealing with the dark side of life and character.”  Richard\nHarding Davis’s “Blackmail” is a notable example of tragedy. [1]",
        "[1] See Appendix.",
        "Melodrama:  “A romantic [connoting love] play, generally of a\nserious character, in which effect is sought by startling incidents,\nstriking situations, exaggerated sentiment and thrilling denouement,\naided by elaborate stage effects.  The more thrilling passages are\nsometimes accentuated by musical accompaniments, the only surviving\nrelic of the original musical character of the melodrama.”",
        "Taylor Granville’s “The System” is one of the finest examples of\npure melodrama seen in vaudeville. [2]",
        "[2] Written by Taylor Granville, Junie MacCree and Edward Clark;\nsee Appendix.",
        "There are, of course, certain other divisions into which these\nfour basic kinds of playlet–as well as the full-length play–may\nbe separated, but they are more or less false forms.  However,\nfour are worthy of particular mention:",
        "The Society Drama:  The form of drama in which a present-day story\nis told, and the language, dress and manners of the actors are\nthose of polite modern society. [1] You will see how superficial\nthe distinction is, when you realize that the plot may be farcical,\ncomic, tragic or melodramatic.",
        "[1] As the dramas of the legitimate stage are more often remembered\nby name than are vaudeville acts, I will mention as example of the\nsociety drama Clyde Fitch’s The Climbers.  This fine satire skirted\nthe edge of tragedy.",
        "The same is true of",
        "The Problem Drama:  The form of drama dealing with life’s\n\"problems\"–of sex, business, or what not. [2]",
        "[2] Ibsen’s Ghosts; indeed, nearly every one of the problem master’s\nplays offer themselves as examples of the problem type.",
        "And the same is likewise true of",
        "The Pastoral-Rural Drama:  The form of drama dealing with rustic\nlife. [3]",
        "[3] The long play Way Down East is a fine example of the pastoral–or\nrural–drama of American life.",
        "And also of",
        "The Detective Drama:  [4] The form of drama dealing with the\ndetection of crime and the apprehension of the criminal.  I cannot\nrecollect a detective playlet–or three-act play, for that\nmatter–that is not melodramatic.  When the action is not purely\nmelodramatic, the lines and the feeling usually thrill with\nmelodrama. [5] “The System,” which is a playlet dealing with the\ndetection of detectives, is but one example in point.",

        "Remember that this chapter is merely one of definitions and that\na definition is a description of something given to it after–not\nbefore–it is finished.  A definition is a tag, like the label the\nentomologist ties to the pin after he has the butterfly nicely\ndead.  Of questionable profit it would be to you, struggling to\nwaken your playlet into life, to worry about a definition that\nmight read “Here Lies a Polite Comedy.”",
        "Professor Baker says that the tragedies of Shakespere may have\nseemed to the audiences of their own day “not tragedies at all,\nbut merely more masterly specimens of dramatic story-telling than\nthe things that preceded them.” [1] If Shakespere did not worry\nabout the precise labels of the plays he was busy writing and\nproducing, you and I need not.  Forget definitions–forget everything\nbut your playlet and the grip, the thrill, the punch, the laughter\nof your plot.",
        "[1] Development of Shakespere as a Dramatist, by Prof. Baker of\nHarvard University.",
        "To sum up:  The limits of the playlet are narrow, its requirements\nare exacting, but within those limits and those requirements you\nmay picture anything you possess the power to present.  Pick out\nfrom life some incident, character, temperament–whatever you\nwill–and flash upon it the glare of the vaudeville spot-light;\nbreathe into it the breath of life; show its every aspect and\neffect; dissect away the needless; vivify the series of actions\nyou have chosen for your brief and trenchant crisis; lift it all\nwith laughter or touch it all with tears.  Like a searchlight your\nplaylet must flash over the landscape of human hearts and rest\nupon some phase of passion, some momentous incident, and make it\nstand out clear and real from the darkness of doubt that surrounds\nit.",
        "Where does a playlet writer get his idea?  How does he recognize\na playlet idea when it presents itself to him?  How much of the\nplaylet is achieved when he hits on the idea?  These questions are\nasked successful playlet writers every day, but before we proceed\nto find their answers, we must have a paragraph or two of definition.",
        "Whenever the word “problem” is used–as, “the problem of a playlet\"–I\ndo not mean it in the sense that one gathers when he hears the\nwords “problem play\"; nothing whatever of sex or the other problems\nof the day is meant.  What I mean is grasped at first glance better,\nperhaps, by the word “theme.”  Yet “theme” does not convey the\nprecise thought I wish to associate with the idea.",
        "A theme is a subject–that much I wish to convey–but I choose\n\"problem” because I wish to connote the fact that the theme of a\nplaylet is more than a subject:  it is precisely what a problem in\nmathematics is.  Given a problem in geometry, you must solve\nit–from its first statement all the way through to the “Q.E.D.\"\nEach step must bear a plain and logical relation to that which\nwent before and what follows.  Your playlet theme is your problem,\nand you must choose for a theme or subject only such a problem as\ncan be “proved” conclusively within the limits of a playlet.",
        "Naturally, you are inclined to inquire as a premise to the questions\nthat open this chapter, What are the themes or subjects that offer\nthemselves as best suited to playlet requirements?  In other words,\nwhat make the best playlet problems?  Here are a few that present\nthemselves from memory of playlets that have achieved exceptional\nsuccess:",

        "Youth that lies in the mind and not in the body or dress may make\na grandmother act and seem younger than her granddaughter–\"Youth,\"\nby Edgar Allan Woolf.",
        "A foolish young woman may leave her husband because she has “found\nhim out,” yet return to him again when she discovers that another\nman is no better than he is–\"The Lollard,” by Edgar Allan Woolf.",
        "A man may do away with another, but escape the penalty because of\nthe flawless method of the killing–\"Blackmail,” by Richard Harding\nDavis.",
        "A wide range of themes is shown in even these few playlets, isn’t\nthere?  Yet the actual range of themes from which playlet problems\nmay be chosen is not even suggested.  Though I stated the problems\nof all the playlets that were ever presented in vaudeville, the\nfield of playlet-problem possibilities would not be even adequately\nsuggested.  Anything, everything, presents itself for a playlet\nproblem–if you can make it human, interesting and alive.",
        "What interests men and women?  Everything, you answer.  Whatever\ninterests you and your family, and your neighbor and his family,\nand the man across the street and his wife’s folks back home–is\na subject for a playlet.  Whatever causes you to stop and think,\nto laugh or cry, is a playlet problem.  “Art is life seen through\na personality,” is as true of the playlet as of any other art form.",
        "Because some certain subject or theme has never been treated in a\nplaylet, does not mean that it cannot be.  It simply means that\nthat particular subject has never yet appealed to a man able to\npresent it successfully.  Vaudeville is hungering for writers able\nto make gripping playlets out of themes that never have been treated\nwell.  To such it offers its largest rewards.  What do you know\nbetter than anyone else–what do you feel keener than anyone else\ndoes–what can you present better than anyone else?  That is the\nsubject you should choose for your playlet problem.",
        "And so you see that a playlet problem is not merely just “an idea\";\nit is a subject that appeals to a writer as offering itself with\npeculiar credentials–as the theme that he should select.  It is\nanything at all–anything that you can make your own by your mastery\nof its every angle.",
        "(a) Unfamiliar Themes.  If a subject of which you have not a\nfamiliar knowledge presents itself to you, reject it.  Imagine how\na producer, the actors and an audience–if they let the thing go\nthat far–would laugh at a playlet whose premises were false and\nwhose incidents were silly, because untrue.  Never give anyone an\nopportunity to look up from a manuscript of yours and grin, as he\nsays:  “This person’s a fool; he doesn’t know what he’s writing\nabout.”",
        "(b) “Cause” Themes.  Although more powerful than the “stump” or\nthe pulpit today, and but little less forceful than the newspaper\nas a means of exposing intolerable conditions and ushering in new\nand better knowledge, the stage is not the place for propaganda.\nThe public goes to the theatre to be entertained, not\ninstructed–particularly is this true of vaudeville–and the writer\ndaring enough to attempt to administer even homeopathic doses of\ninstruction, must be a master-hand to win.  Once in a generation\na Shaw may rise, who, by a twist of his pen, can make the public\nthink, while he wears a guileful smile as he propounds philosophy\nfrom under a jester’s cap; but even then his plays must be edited–as\nsome of Shaw’s are–of all but the most dramatic of his belligerently\nimpudent notions.",
        "If you have a religious belief, a political creed, a racial\npropagandum–in short, a “cause\"–either to defend or to forward,\ndon’t write it in a drama.  The legitimate stage might be induced\nto present it, if someone were willing to pay the theatre’s losses,\nbut vaudeville does not want it.  Choose any form of presentation–a\nnewspaper article, a magazine story, anything at all–save a playlet\nfor polemic or “cause” themes.",
        "(c) Hackneyed Themes.  What has been “done to death” in vaudeville?\nYou know as well as the most experienced playlet-writer, if you\nwill only give the subject unbiased thought.  What are the things\nthat make you squirm in your seat and the man next you reach for\nhis hat and go out?  A list would fill a page, but there are two\nthat should be mentioned because so many playlets built upon them\nare now being offered to producers without any hope of acceptance.\nThere is the “mistaken identity” theme, in which the entire action\nhinges on one character’s mistaking another for someone else–one\nword spoken in time would make the entire action needless, but the\nword is never spoken–or there would be no playlet.  And the\n\"henpecked husband,” or the mistreated wife, who gets back at the\nfinal curtain, is a second.  Twenty years hence either one of these\nmay be the theme of the “scream” of the season, for stage fashions\nchange like women’s styles, but, if you wish your playlet produced\ntoday, don’t employ them.",
        "(d) Improper Themes.  Any theme that would bring a blush to the\ncheek of your sister, of your wife, of your daughter, you must\navoid.  No matter how pure your motive might be in making use of\nsuch a theme, resolutely deny it when it presents itself to you.\nThe fact that the young society girl who offered me a playlet based\non, to her, an amazing experience down at the Women’s Night\nCourt–where she saw the women of the streets brought before the\njudge and their “men” paying the fines–was a clean-minded,\nbig-hearted girl anxious to help better conditions, did not make\nher theme any cleaner or her playlet any better.",
        "Of course, I do not mean that you must ignore such conditions when\nyour playlet calls for the use of such characters.  I mean that\nyou should not base your playlet entirely on such themes–you\nshould never make such a theme the chief reason of your playlet’s\nbeing.",
        "You may treat any subject or play upon any theme, whatsoever it\nmay be, provided it is not a “cause,” is not hackneyed, is not\nimproper for its own sake and likely to bring a blush to the cheeks\nof those you love, is familiar to you in its every angle, and is\na subject that forms a problem which can be proved conclusively\nwithin the requirements of a playlet.",
        "It is generally accepted by students of the novel and the short-story\nthat there are three ways of constructing a narrative:",
        "(a) Characters may be fitted with a story.",
        "(b) A sequence of events may be fitted with characters.",
        "(c) An interesting atmosphere may be expressed by characters and\na sequence of events.",
        "In other words, a narrative may be told by making either the\ncharacters or the events or the atmosphere peculiarly and particularly\nprominent.",
        "It should be obvious that the special character of vaudeville makes\nthe last-named–the story of atmosphere–the least effective;\nindeed, as drama is action–by which I mean a clash of wills and\nthe outcome–no audience would be likely to sit through even\ntwenty minutes of something which, after all, merely results in a\n\"feeling.”  Therefore the very nature of the pure story of atmosphere\neliminates it from the stage; next in weakness of effect is the\nstory of character; while the strongest–blood of its blood and\nbone of its bone–is the story of dramatic events.  This is for\nwhat the stage is made and by which it lives.  To be sure, character\nand atmosphere both have their places in the play of dramatic\naction, but for vaudeville those places must be subordinate.",
        "These last two ways of constructing a story will be taken up and\ndiscussed in detail later on, in their proper order; they are\nmentioned here to help make clear how a playwright gets an idea.",
        "It is not at all uncommon for a playlet writer to be asked to fit\nsome legitimate star, about to enter vaudeville, with a playlet\nthat shall have for its hero or its heroine the particular character\nin which the star has had marked success. [1] And often a man and\nwife who have achieved a reputation in vaudeville together will\norder a new playlet that shall have characters modeled on the lines\nof those in the old playlet.  Or, indeed, as I have know in many\ninstances, three performers will order a playlet in which there\nmust be characters to fit them all.  When a writer receives such\nan order it would seem that at least a part of his task is already\ndone for him; but this is not the case, he still must seek that\nmost important things–a story.",
        "[1] In precisely the same way writers of the full-evening play for\nthe legitimate stage are forever fashioning vehicles for famous\nstars.  The fact that the chief consideration is the star and that\nthe play is considered merely as a “vehicle” is one of the reasons\nwhy our plays are not always of the best.  Where you consider a\npersonality greater than a story, the story is likely to suffer.\nCan you name more than one or two recent plays so fashioned that\nhave won more than a season’s run?",
        "The beginner, fortunately, is not brought face to face with this\nproblem; he is foot-free to wander wherever his fancy leads.  And\nyet he may find in his thoughts a character or two who beg to serve\nhim so earnestly that he cannot deny them.  So he takes them,\nknowing them so well that he is sure he can make them live–and\nhe constructs a story around them.",
        "Or there may first pop into his mind a story in its entirety, full\nfledged, with beginning, middle and ending–that is; thoroughly\nmotivated in every part and equipped with characters that live and\nbreathe.  Unhappily this most fortunate of occurrences usually\nhappens only in the middle of the night, when one must wake up\nnext morning and sadly realize it was but a dream.",
        "A playwright, let us say, reads in the newspapers of some striking\ncharacters, or of an event that appeals to him as funny or as\nhaving a deep dramatic import.  There may be only a few bald lines\ntelling the news.  features of the story in one sentence, or there\nmay be an entire column, discussing the case from every angle.\nWhatever it is, the bit of news appeals to him, and maybe of all\nmen to him only, so he starts thinking about the possibilities it\noffers for a playlet.",
        "Some striking incident rises out of the life about the playwright\nand he sees it or hears about it, and straightway comes the thought:\nThis is a playlet idea.  A large number of playlets have been\ngerminated so.",
        "Some personal experience which wakens in the mind of the playwright\nthe thought, Here’s something that’ll make a good playlet, is one\nof the fruitful sources of playlet-germs.",
        "But however the germ idea comes to him–whether as a complete\nstory, or merely as one striking incident, or just a situation\nthat recommends itself to him as worth while fitting with a story–he\nbegins by turning it over in his mind and casting it into dramatic\nform.",
        "For the purpose of illustration, let us suppose that Taylor\nGranville, who conceived the idea of “The System,” had read in the\nNew York newspapers about the Becker case and the startling expose\nof the alleged police “system” that grew out of the Rosenthal\nmurder, here is how his mind, trained to vaudeville and dramatic\nconventions, might have evolved that excellent melodramatic playleet.\n[1]",
        "[1] As a matter of fact, Mr. Granville had the first draft of the\nplaylet in his trunk many months before the Rosenthal murder\noccurred, and Mr. MacCree and Mr. Clark were helping him with the\nfinal revisions when the fatal shot was fired.",
        "In this connection it should be emphasized that the Becker case\ndid not make The System a great playlet; the investigation of the\nNew York Police Department only gave it the added attraction of\ntimeliness and, therefore, drew particular attention to it.  Dozens\nof other playlets and many long plays that followed The System on\nthe wave of the same timely interest failed.  Precisely as Within\nthe Law, Bayard Veiller’s great play, so successful for the Selwyn\nCompany, was given a striking timeliness by the Rosenthal murder,\nThe System reaped merely the brimming harvest of lucky accident.\nAnd like Within the Law, this great playlet would be as successful\ntoday as it was then–because it is “big” in itself. [end footnote]",
        "The incidents of “the Becker Case” were these:  Herman Rosenthal,\na gambler of notorious reputation, one day went to District Attorney\nWhitman with the story that he was being hounded by the police–at\nthe command of a certain Police Lieutenant.  Rosenthal asserted\nthat he had a story to tell which would shake up the New York\nPolice Department.  He was about to be called to testify to his\nalleged story when he was shot to death in front of the Metropole\nHotel on Forty-third Street and the murderer or murderers escaped\nin an automobile.  Several notorious underworld characters were\narrested, charged with complicity in the murder, and some, in the\nhope, it has been said, of receiving immunity, confessed and\nimplicated Police Lieutenant Becker, who was arrested on the charge\nof being the instigator of the crime. [1] These are the bare facts\nas every newspaper in New York City told them in glaring headlines\nat the time.  Merely as incidents of a striking story, Mr. Granville\nwould, it is likely, have turned them over in his mind with these\nthoughts:",
        "[1] Becker’s subsequent trial, conviction, sentence to death and\nexecution occurred many months later and could not have entered\ninto the playwright’s material, therefore they are not recounted\nhere.",
        "“If I take these incidents as they stand, I’ll have a grewsome\nending that’ll ’go great’ for a while–if the authorities let me\nplay it–and then the playlet will die with the waning interest.\nThere isn’t much that’s dramatic in a gambler shown in the District\nAttorney’s Office planning to ’squeal,’ and then getting shot for\nit, even though the police in the playlet were made to instigate\nthe murder.  It’d make a great ’movie,’ perhaps, but there isn’t\nenough time in vaudeville to go through all the motions:  I’ve got\nto recast it into drama.",
        "“I must ’forget’ the bloody ending, too–it may be great drama,\nbut it isn’t good vaudeville.  The two-a-day wants the happy ending,\nif it can get it.",
        "“And even if the Becker story’s true in every detail, Rosenthal\nisn’t a character with whom vaudeville can sympathize–I’ll have\nto get a lesser offender, to win sympathy–a ’dip’s’ about right–\n’The Eel.’",
        "“There isn’t any love-interest, either–where’s the girl that\nsticks to him through thick and thin?  I’ll add his sweetheart,\nGoldie.  And I’ll give The Eel more sympathy by making Dugan’s\nmotive the attempt to win her.",
        "“Then there’s got to be the square Copper–the public knows that\nthe Police force is fundamentally honest–so the Department has\ngot to clean itself up, in my playlet; fine, there’s McCarthy, the\nhonest Inspector.”",
        "Here we have a little more, perhaps, than a bare germ idea, but\nit is probably the sort of thing that came into Mr. Granville’s\nmind with the very first thought of “The System.”  Even more might\nhave come during the first consideration of his new playlet, and–as\nwe are dealing now not with a germ idea only but primarily with\nhow a playwright’s mind works–let us follow his supposititious\nreasoning further:",
        "“All right; now, there’s got to be an incident that’ll give Dugan\nhis chance to ’railroad’ The Eel, and a money-society turn is\nalways good, so we have Mrs. Worthington and the necklace, with\nGoldie, the suspected maid, who casts suspicion on The Eel.  Dugan\n’plants’ it all, gets the necklace himself, tries to lay it to The\nEel, and win Goldie besides–but a dictograph shows him up.  Now\na man-to-man struggle between Dugan and The Eel for good old\nmelodrama.  The Eel is losing, in comes the Inspector and saves\nhim–Dugan caught–triumph of the honest police–and Goldie and\nThe Eel free to start life anew together.  That’s about it–for a\nstarter, anyway.",
        "“Re-read these dramatic incidents carefully, compare them with the\nincidents of the suggestive case as the newspapers reported them,\nand you will see not only where a playwright may get a germ idea,\nbut how his mind works in casting it into stage form.",
        "The first thing that strikes you is the dissimilarity of the two\nstories; the second, the greater dramatic effectiveness of the\nplot the playlet-writer’s mind has evolved; third, that needless\nincidents have been cut away; fourth, that the very premise of the\nstory, and all the succeeding incidents, lead you to recognize\nthem in the light of the denouement as the logical first step and\nsucceeding steps of which the final scene is inevitably the last;\nfifth, however many doubts may hover around the story of the\nsuggesting incident, there is no cloud of doubt about the perfect\njustice of the stage story; and, sixth, that while you greet the\nending of the suggesting story with a feeling of repugnance, the\nfinal scene of the stage story makes the whole clearly, happily\nand pleasantly true–truer than life itself, to human hearts which\nforever aspire after what we sometimes sadly call “poetic justice.”",
        "Now, in a few short paragraphs, we may sum up the answer to the\nquestion which opens this chapter, and answer the other two questions\nas well.  A playlet writer may get the germ of a playlet idea:\nfrom half-ideas suggested by the necessity of fitting certain\nplayers; directly from his own imagination; from the newspapers;\nfrom what someone tells him, or from his observation of incidents\nthat come under his personal notice; from experiences that happen\nto him–in fact, from anywhere.",
        "A playlet writer recognizes that the character or characters, the\nincident or incidents, possess a funny, serious or tragic grip,\nand the fact that he, himself, is gripped, is evidence that a\nplaylet is “there,” if–IF–he can trust his own dramatic instinct.\nA playlet writer recognizes an idea as a playlet idea, because he\nis able so to recognize such an idea; there is no escape from this:\nYOU MUST POSSESS DRAMATIC INSTINCT [1] to recognize playlet ideas\nand write playlets.",
        "[1] See the following chapter on “The Dramatic–the Vital Element\nof Plot.”",
        "No two persons in this world act alike, and certainly no two persons\nthink alike.  How much of a playlet is achieved when the germ idea\nis found and recognized, depends somewhat upon the idea–whether\nit is of characters that must be fitted with a story, a series of\nincidents, or one incident only–but more upon the writer.  I have\nknown playlets which were the results of ideas that originated in\nthe concepts of clever final situations, the last two minutes of\nthe playlet serving as the incentive to the construction of the\nstory that led inevitably up to the climax.  I have also known\nplaylets whose big scenes were the original ideas–the opening and\nfinish being fitted to them.  One or two writers have told me of\nplaylets which came almost entirely organized and motivated into\ntheir minds with the first appearance of the germ idea.  And others\nhave told me of the hours of careful thinking through which they\nsaw, in divers half-purposes of doubt, the action and the characters\nemerge into a definite, purposeful whole.",
        "What one writer considers a full-fledged germ idea, may be to\nanother but the first faint evidence that an idea may possibly be\nthere.  The skilled playlet-writer will certainly grasp a germ\nidea, and appraise its worth quicker than the novice can.  In the\neager acceptance of half-formed ideas that speciously glitter,\nlies the pitfall which entraps many a beginner.  Therefore, engrave\non the tablets of your resolution this determination and single\nstandard:",
        "Never accept a subject as a germ idea and begin to write a playlet\n  until you have turned its theme over in your mind a sufficient\n  length of time to establish its worth beyond question.  Consider\n  it from every angle in the light of the suggestions in this\n  chapter, and make its characters and its action as familiar to\n  you as is the location of every article in your own room.  Then,\n  when your instinct for the dramatic tells you there is no doubt\n  that here is the germ idea of a playlet, state it in one short\n  sentence, and consider that statement as a problem that must be\n  solved logically, clearly and conclusively, within the requirements\n  of the playlet form.",
        "With the germ idea the entire playlet may flood into the writer’s\nmind, or come in little waves that rise continually, like the ever\nadvancing tide, to the flood that touches high-water mark.  But,\nhowever complete the germ idea may be, it depends upon the writer\nalone whether he struggles like a novice to keep his dramatic head\nabove water, or strikes out with the bold, free strokes of the\npractised swimmer.",
        "What the dramatic is–no matter whether it be serious or comic in\ntone–requires some consideration in a volume such as this, even\nthough but a brief discussion is possible and only a line of thought\nmay be pointed out.",
        "This discussion is placed here in the sequence of chapters, because\nit first begins to trouble the novice after he has accepted his\ngerm idea, and before he has succeeded in casting it into a stage\nstory.  Indeed, at that moment even the most self-sure becomes\nconscious of the demands of the dramatic.  Yet this chapter will\nbe found to overlap some that precede it and some that\nfollow–particularly the chapter on plot structure, of which this\ndiscussion may be considered an integral part–as is the case in\nevery attempt to put into formal words, principles separate in\ntheory, but inseparable in application.",
        "In the previous chapter, the conscious thought that precedes even\nthe acceptance of a germ idea was insisted on–it was “played up,\"\nas the stage phrase terms a scene in which the emotional key is\npitched high–with the purpose of forcing upon your attention the\nprime necessity of thinking out–not yet writing–the playlet.\nEmphasis was also laid on the necessity for the possession of\ndramatic instinct–a gift far different from the ability to think–by\nanyone who would win success in writing this most difficult of\ndramatic forms.  But now I wish to lay an added stress–to pitch\neven higher the key of emphasis–on one fundamental, this vital\nnecessity:  Anyone who would write a playlet must possess in himself,\nas an instinct–something that cannot be taught and cannot be\nacquired–the ability to recognize and grasp the dramatic.",
        "No matter if you master the technic by which the great dramatists\nhave built their plays, you cannot achieve success in writing the\nplaylet if you do not possess an innate sense of what is dramatic.\nFor, just as a man who is tone-deaf [1] might produce musical\nmanuscripts which while technically faultless would play inharmoniously,\nso the man who is drama-blind might produce “perfect” playlet\nmanuscripts that would play in dramatic discords.",
        "[1] Not organically defective, as were the ears of the great\ncomposer, Beethoven, but tone-deaf, as a person may be color-blind.",
        "When you witness a really thrilling scene in a play you find\nyourself sitting on the edge of your seat; you clench your hands\nuntil the nails sink into your flesh; tears roll down your cheeks\nat other scenes, until you are ashamed of your emotion and wipe\nthem furtively away; and you laugh uproariously at still other\nscenes.  But your quickened heart-beats, your tears, and your\nlaughter are, however, no evidence that you possess dramatic\ninstinct–they are a tribute to the possession of that gift in the\nperson who wrote the play.  So do not confuse appreciation–the\nultimate result of another’s gift–with the ability to create:\nthey are two very different things.",
        "No more does comprehension of a dramatist’s methods–a sort of\ndetached and often cold appreciation–indicate the possession of\ngifts other than those of the critic.",
        "Dramatic instinct is the ability to see the dramatic moments in\n  real life; to grasp the dramatic possibilities; to pick out the\n  thrills, the tears and the laughter, and to lift these out from\n  the mass and set them–combined, coherent and convincing–in a\n  story that seems truer than life itself, when unfolded on the\n  stage by characters who are more real than reality. [1]",
        "[1] Arniel in his Journal says:  “The ideal, after all, is truer\nthan the real; for the ideal is the eternal element in perishable\nthings; it is their type, their sum, their ’raison d’etre,’ their\nformula in the book of the Creator, and therefore at once the most\nexact and the most condensed expression of them.”",
        "Elizabeth Woodbridge in her volume, The Drama, says:  “It is in\nfinding the mean between personal narrowness which is too selective,\nand photographic impersonality that is not selective at all, that\nthe individuality of the artist, his training, and his ideals, are\ntested.  It is this that determines how much his work shall possess\nof what we may call poetic, or artistic, truth.”  [end footnote]",
        "Yet, true as it is that dramatic ability inevitably shines through\nfinished drama when it is well played upon the stage, there are\nso many determining factors of pleasing theme, acting, production\nand even of audience–and so many little false steps both in\nmanuscript and presentation; which might be counted unfortunate\naccident–that the failure of a play is not always a sure sign\nthat the playwright lacks dramatic instinct.  If it were, hardly\none of our successful dramatists of today would have had the heart\nto persevere–for some wrote twenty full-evening plays before one\nwas accepted by a manager, and then plodded through one or more\nstage failures before they were rewarded with final success.  If\nproducing managers could unerringly tell who has dramatic instinct\nhighly developed and who has it not at all, there would be few\nplay failures and the show-business would cease to be a gamble\nthat surpasses even horse-racing for hazard.",
        "Not only is it impossible for anyone to weigh the quantity or to\nassay the quality of dramatic instinct–whether in his own or\nanother’s breast–but it is as nearly impossible for anyone to\ndecide from reading a manuscript whether a play will succeed or\nfail.  Charles Frohman is reported to have said:  “A man who could\npick out winners would be worth a salary of a million dollars a\nyear.”",
        "And even when a play is put into rehearsal the most experienced\nmen in the business cannot tell unerringly whether it will succeed\nor fail before an audience.  An audience–the heart of the crowd,\nthe intellect of the mass, whatever you wish to call it–is at\nonce the jury that tries a play and the judge who pronounces\nsentence to speedy death or a long and happy life.  It is an\naudience, the “crowd,” that awards the certificate of possession\nof dramatic instinct. [1]",
        "[1] [four paragraphs:]",
        "From three of the ablest critics of the “theatre crowd” I quote a\ntabloid statement:",
        "“The theatre is a function of the crowd,” says Brander Matthews,\n\"and the work of the dramatist is conditioned by the audience to\nwhich he meant to present it.  In the main, this influence is\nwholesome, for it tends to bring about a dealing with themes of\nuniversal interest.  To some extent, it may be limiting and even\nharmful–but to what extent we cannot yet determine in our present\nignorance of that psychology of the crowd which LeBon has analyzed\nso interestingly.”",
        "Here is M. LeBon’s doctrine neatly condensed by Clayton Hamilton:\n\"The mental qualities in which men differ from one another are the\nacquired qualities of intellect and character; but the qualities\nin which they are one are basic passions of the race.  A crowd,\ntherefore, is less intellectual and more emotional than the\nindividuals that compose it.  It is less reasonable, less judicious,\nless disinterested, more credulous, more primitive, more partisan;\nand hence, a man, by the mere fact that he forms a part of an\norganized crowd, descends several rungs on the ladder of civilization.\nEven the most cultured and intellectual of men, when he forms an\natom of a crowd, loses consciousness of his acquired mental\nqualities, and harks back to his primal nakedness of mind.  The\ndramatist, therefore, because he writes for the crowd, writes for\nan uncivilized and uncultivated mind, a mind richly human, vehement\nin approbation, violent in disapproval, easily credulous, eagerly\nenthusiastic, boyishly heroic, and carelessly thinking.”",
        "And Clayton Hamilton himself adds that, “. . .both in its sentiments\nand in its opinions, the crowd is hugely commonplace.  It is\nincapable of original thought and of any but inherited emotion.\nIt has no speculation in its eyes.  What it feels was felt before\nthe flood; and what it thinks, its fathers thought before it.  The\nmost effective moments in the theatre are those that appeal to\ncommonplace emotions–love of women, love of home, love of country,\nlove of right, anger, jealousy, revenge, ambition, lust and\ntreachery.”",
        "By what standards, then, do producers decide whether a play has\nat least a good chance of success?  How is it possible for a manager\nto pick a successful play even once in a while?  Why is it that\nmanagers do not produce failures all the time?",
        "Leaving outside of our consideration the question of changeable\nfashions in themes, and the commercial element (which includes the\nnumber of actors required, the scenery, costumes and similar\nfactors), let us devote our attention, as the manager does, to the\ndetermining element–the story.",
        "Does the story grip?  Does it thrill?  Does it lure to laughter?\nDoes it touch to tears?  Is it well constructed–that is, does it\ninterest every minute of the time?  Is every word, is every action,\nthoroughly motivated?  Is the dialogue fine?  Are the characters\ninteresting, lovable, hateable, laughable, to be remembered?  Does\nit state its problem clearly, so that everyone can comprehend it,\ndevelop its angle absorbingly, and end, not merely stop, with\ncomplete satisfaction?  Could one little scene be added, or even\none little passage be left out, without marring the whole?  Is it\ntrue to life–truer than life?  If it is all this, it is good\ndrama.",
        "Good drama is therefore more than plot.  It is more than story\nplus characters, dialogue, acting, costumes, scenery–it is more\nthan them all combined.  Just as a man is more than his body, his\nspeech, his dress, his movings to and fro in the scenes where he\nplays out his life, and even more than his deeds, so is a play\nmore than the sum of all its parts.  Every successful play, every\ngreat playlet, possesses a soul–a character, if you like–that\ncarries a message to its audiences by means which cannot be analyzed.",
        "But the fact that the soul of a great play cannot be analyzed does\nnot prevent some other dramatist from duplicating the miracle in\nanother play.  And it is from a study of these great plays that\ncertain mechanics of the drama–though, of course, they cannot\nexplain the hidden miracle–have been laid down as laws.",
        "These few observations upon the nature of drama, which have scarcely\nbeen materially added to since Aristotle laid down the first over\ntwo thousand years ago, will be taken up and discussed in their\nrelation to the playlet in the chapter on plot construction.  Here\nthey have no place, because we are concerned now not with how\nthe results are obtained, but with what they are.",
        "Let us approach our end by the standard definition route.  The\nword “drama” is defined by Webster as, “A composition in poetry\nor prose, or both, representing a picture of human life, arranged\nfor action, and having a plot, developed by the words and actions\nof its characters, which culminates in a final situation of human\ninterest.  It is usually designed for production on the stage,\nwith the accessories of costumes, scenery, music, etc.”",
        "“Dramatic,” is defined as, “Of or pertaining to the drama; represented\nby action; appropriate to or in the form of a drama; theatrical.\nCharacterized by the force and fidelity appropriate to the drama.”",
        "In this last sentence we have the first step to what we are seeking:\nanything to be dramatic must be forceful, and it also must be\nfaithful to life.  And in the preceding sentence, “dramatic. . .\nis theatrical,” we have a second step.",
        "But what is “forceful,” and why does Webster define anything that\nis dramatic as “theatrical”?  To define one shadow by the name of\nanother shadow is not making either clearer.  However, the necessary\nlooseness of the foregoing definitions is why they are so valuable\nto us–they are most suggestive.",
        "If the maker of a dictionary, [1] hampered by space restrictions,\nfinds it necessary to define “dramatic” by the word “theatrical,\"\nwe may safely assume that theatrical effect has a foundation in\nthe very heart of man.  How many times have you heard someone say\nof another’s action, “Oh, he did that just for theatrical effect”?\nInstantly you knew that the speaker was accusing the other of a\ndesire to impress you by a carefully calculated action, either of\nthe fineness of his own character or of the necessity and righteousness\nof your doing what he suggested so forcefully.  We need not go\nback several thousand years to Aristotle to determine what is\ndramatic.  In the promptings of our own hearts we can find the\nanswer. [2]",
        "[1] Webster’s Dictionary was chosen because it is, historically,\nclosely associated with American life, and therefore would seem\nto reflect the best American thought upon the peculiar form of our\nown drama.",
        "[2] Shelley, in his preface to Cenci, says:  “The highest moral\npurpose aimed at in the highest species of the drama is the teaching\nof the human heart, through its sympathies and antipathies, the\nknowledge of itself.”",
        "What is dramatic, is not what falls out as things ordinarily occur\nin life’s flow of seemingly disconnected happenings; it is what\noccurs with precision and purpose, and with results which are\neventually recognizable as being far beyond the forces that show\nupon its face.  In an illuminating flash that reveals character,\nwe comprehend what led up to that instant and what will follow.\nIt is the revealing flash that is dramatic.  Drama is a series of\nrevealing flashes.",
        "“This is not every-day life,” we say, “but typical life–life\nas it would be if it were compactly ordered–life purposeful, and\nleading surely to an evident somewhere.”",
        "And, as man’s heart beats high with hope and ever throbs with\njustice, those occurrences that fall out as he would wish them are\nthe ones he loves the best; in this we find the reason for “poetic\njustice\"–the “happy ending.”  For, as “man is of such stuff as\ndreams are made of,” so are his plays made of his dreams.  Here\nis the foundation of what is dramatic.",
        "Yet, the dramatic ending may be unhappy, if it rounds the play out\nwith big and logical design.  Death is not necessarily poignantly\nsad upon the stage, because death is life’s logical end.  And who\ncan die better than he who dies greatly? [1] Defeat, sorrow and\nsuffering have a place as exquisitely fitting as success, laughter\nand gladness, because they are inalienable elements of life.  Into\nevery life a little sadness must come, we know, and so the lives\nof our stage-loves may be “draped with woe,” and we but love them\nbetter.",
        "[1] “The necessity that tragedy and the serious drama shall possess\nan element of greatness or largeness–call it nobility, elevation,\nwhat you will–has always been recognized.  The divergence has\ncome when men have begun to say what they meant by that quality,\nand–which is much the same thing–how it is to be attained.  Even\nAristotle, when he begins to analyze methods, sounds, at first\nhearing, a little superficial.”  Elizabeth Woodbridge, The Drama,\npp. 23-24.",
        "Great souls who suffer, either by the hand of Fate, or unjustly\nthrough the machinations of their enemies, win our sympathy for\ntheir sorrows and our admiration by their noble struggles.  If\nFate dooms them, there may be no escape, and still we are content;\nbut if they suffer by man’s design, there must be escape from\nsorrow and defeat through happiness to triumph–for, if it were\nnot so, they would not be great.  The heart of man demands that\nthose he loves upon the stage succeed, or fail greatly, because\nthe hero’s dreams are our dreams–the hero’s life is ours, the\nhero’s sorrows are our own, and because they are ours, the hero\nmust triumph over his enemies.",
        "Thus, for the very reason that life is a conflict and because man’s\nheart beats quickest when he faces another man, and leaps highest\nwhen he conquers him, the essence of the dramatic is–conflict.\nVoltaire in one of his letters said that every scene in a play\nshould represent a combat.  In “Memories and Portraits,” Stevenson\nsays:  “A good serious play must be founded on one of the passionate\ncruces of life, where duty and inclination come nobly to the\ngrapple.”  Goethe, in his “William Meister” says:  “All events\noppose him [the hero] and he either clears and removes every\nobstacle out of his path, or else becomes their victim.”  But it\nwas the French critic, Ferdinand Brunetiere, who defined dramatic\nlaw most sharply and clearly, and reduced it to such simple terms\nthat we may state it in this one free sentence:  “Drama is a\nstruggle of wills and its outcome.”",
        "In translating and expounding Brunetiere’s theory, Brander Matthews\nin his “A Study of the Drama” condenses the French critic’s\nreasoning into these illuminating paragraphs:",
        "“It [the drama] must have some essential principle of its own.\nIf this essential principle can be discovered, then we shall be\nin possession of the sole law of the drama, the one obligation\nwhich all writers for the stage must accept.  Now, if we examine\na collection of typical plays of every kind, tragedies and melodramas,\ncomedies and farces, we shall find that the starting point of\neveryone of them is the same.  Some one central character wants\nsomething; and this exercise of volition is the mainspring of the\naction. . . .  In every successful play, modern or ancient, we shall\nfind this clash of contending desires, this assertion of the human\nwill against strenuous opposition of one kind or another.",
        "“Brunetiere made it plain that the drama must reveal the human\nwill in action; and that the central figure in a play must know\nwhat he wants and must strive for it with incessant determination.\n. . .Action in the drama is thus seen to be not mere movement or\nexternal agitation; it is the expression of a will which knows\nitself.",
        "“The French critic maintained also that, when this law of the drama\nwas once firmly grasped, it helped to differentiate more precisely\nthe several dramatic species.  If the obstacles against which the\nwill of the hero has to contend are insurmountable, Fate or\nProvidence or the laws of nature–then there is tragedy, and the\nend of the struggle is likely to be death, since the hero is\ndefeated in advance.  But if these obstacles are not absolutely\ninsurmountable, being only social conventions and human prejudices,\nthen the hero has a chance to attain his desire,–and in this case,\nwe have the serious drama without an inevitably fatal ending.\nChange this obstacle a little, equalize the conditions of the\nstruggle, set two wills in opposition–and we have comedy.  And\nif the obstacle is of still a lower order, merely an absurdity of\ncustom, for instance, we find ourselves in farce.”",
        "Here we have, sharply and brilliantly stated, the sole law of\ndrama–whether it be a play in five acts requiring two hours and\na half to present, or a playlet taking but twenty minutes.  This\none law is all that the writer need keep in mind as the great\ngeneral guide for plot construction.",
        "Today, of course, as in every age when the drama is a bit more\nvirile than in the years that have immediately preceded it, there\nis a tendency to break away from conventions and to cavil at\ndefinitions.  This is a sign of health, and has in the past often\nbeen the first faint stirring which betokened the awakening of the\ndrama to greater uses.  In the past few years, the stage, both\nhere and abroad, has been throbbing with dramatic unrest.  The\nresult has been the presentation of oddities–a mere list of whose\nnames would fill a short chapter–which have aimed to “be different.\"\nAnd in criticising these oddities–whose differences are more\napparent than real–critics of the soundness and eminence of Mr.\nWilliam Archer in England, and Mr. Clayton Hamilton in America,\nhave taken the differences as valid ground for opposing Brunetiere’s\nstatement of the law of the drama.",
        "Mr. Hamilton, in his thought-provoking “Studies in Stage-craft,\"\ntakes occasion to draw attention to the fact that Brunetiere’s\nstatement is not as old as Aristotle’s comments on the drama.  Mr.\nHamilton seemingly objects to the eagerness with which Brunetiere’s\nstatement was accepted when first it was made, less than a quarter\ncentury ago, and the tenacity with which it has been held ever\nsince; while acknowledging its general soundness he denies its\ntruth, more on account of its youth, it would seem, than on account\nof the few exceptions that “prove it,” putting to one side, or\nforgetting, that its youth is not a fault but a virtue, for had\nit been stated in Aristotle’s day, Brunetiere would not have had\nthe countless plays from which to draw its truth, after the fruitful\nmanner of a scientist working in a laboratory on innumerable\nspecimens of a species.  Yet Mr. Hamilton presents his criticism\nwith such critical skill that he sums it all up in these judicial\nsentences:",
        "”. . .But if this effort were ever perfectly successful, the drama\nwould cease to have a reason for existence, and the logical\nconsequence would be an abolition of the theatre. . . .  But on the\nother hand, if we judge the apostles of the new realism less by\ntheir ultimate aims than by their present achievements, we must\nadmit that they are rendering a very useful service by holding the\nmirror up to many interesting contrasts between human characters\nwhich have hitherto been ignored in the theatre merely because\nthey would not fit into the pattern of the well-made play.”",
        "As to the foremost critical apostle of the “new realism\"–which\nseeks to construct plays which begin anywhere and have no dramatic\nending and would oppose the force of wills by a doubtfully different\n\"negation of wills\"–let us now turn to Mr. William Archer and his\nvery valuable definition of the dramatic in his “Play-Making”:",
        "“The only really valid definition of the dramatic is:  any\nrepresentation of imaginary personages which is capable of interesting\nan average audience assembled in a theatre. . . .  Any further\nattempt to limit the term ’dramatic’ is simply the expression of\nan opinion that such-and-such forms of representation will not be\nfound to interest an audience; and this opinion may always be\nrebutted by experiment.”",
        "Perhaps a truer and certainly as inclusive an observation would\nbe that the word “dramatic,” like the words “picturesque” and\n\"artistic,” has one meaning that is historical and another that\nis creative or prophetic.  To say of anything that it is dramatic\nis to say that it partakes of the nature of all drama that has\ngone before, for “ic” means “like.”  But dramatic does not mean\nonly this, it means besides, as Alexander Black expresses it, that\n\"the new writer finds all the world’s dramatic properties gathered\nas in a storehouse for his instruction.  Under the inspiration of\nthe life of the hour, the big man will gather from them what is\ndramatic today, and the bigger man will see, not only what was\ndramatic yesterday and what is dramatic today, but what will be\ndramatic tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.”",
        "Now these admirably broad views of the drama and the dramatic are\npresented because they are suggestive of the unrestricted paths\nthat you may tread in selecting your themes and deciding on your\ntreatment of them in your playlets.  True, they dangerously represent\nthe trend of “individualism,” and a master of stagecraft may be\nindividual in his plot forms and still be great, but the novice\nis very likely to be only silly.  So read and weigh these several\ntheories with care.  Be as individual as you like in the choice\nof a theme–the more you express your individuality the better\nyour work is likely to be–but in your treatment tread warily in\nthe footprints of the masters, whose art the ages have proved to\nbe true.  Then you stand less chance of straying into the underbrush\nand losing yourself where there are no trails and where no one is\nlikely to hear from you again.",
        "But clear and illuminating as these statements of the law of the\ndrama are, one point needs slight expansion, and another vital\npoint, not yet touched upon, should be stated, in a volume designed\nnot for theory but for practice.",
        "The first is, “Action in the drama is thus seen to be not mere\nmovement or external agitation; it is the expression of a will\nwhich knows itself.”  Paradoxical as it may seem, action that is\ndramatic is not “action,” as the word is commonly understood.\nPhysical activity is not considered at all; the action of a play\nis not acting, but plot–story.  Does the story move–not the\nbodies of the actors, but the merely mental recounting of the\nnarrative?  As the French state the principle in the form of a\ncommand, “Get on with the story!  Get on!”  This is one-half of the\nplaywright’s action-problem.",
        "The other half–the other question–deals, not with the story\nitself, but with how it is made to “get on.”  How it is told in\naction–still mental and always mental, please note–is what\ndifferentiates the stage story from other literary forms like the\nnovel and the short-story.  It must be told dramatically or it is\nnot a stage story; and the dramatic element must permeate its every\nfibre.  Not only must the language be dramatic–slang may in a\ngiven situation be the most dramatic language that could be used–and\nnot only must the quality of the story itself be dramatic, but the\nscene-steps by which the story is unfolded must scintillate with\nthe soul of the dramatic–revealing flashes.",
        "To sum up, the dramatic, in the final analysis, has nothing whatever\nto do with characters moving agitatedly about the stage, or with\nmoving at all, because the dramatic lies not in what happens but\nin what the happening means.  Even a murder may be undramatic,\nwhile the mere utterance of the word “Yes,” by a paralyzed woman\nto a paralyzed man may be the most dramatic thing in the world.\nLet us take another instance:  Here is a stage–in the centre are\nthree men bound or nailed to crosses.  The man at the left turns\nto the one in the middle and sneers:",
        "“If you’re a god, save yourself and us.”",
        "The one at the left interrupts,",
        "“Keep quiet!  We’re guilty, we deserve this, but this Man doesn’t.”",
        "And the Man in the centre says,",
        "“This day shalt thou be with me in paradise.”",
        "Could there be anything more dramatic than that? [1]",
        "[1] Do not attempt to stage this sacred scene.  However, Ran\nKennedy, who wrote The Servant in the House, did so at Winthrop\nAmes’ Little Theatre, New York, in an evening of one-act plays,\nwith surprising results.",
        "To carry this truth still further, let me offer two examples out\nof scores that might be quoted to prove that the dramatic may not\neven depend upon speech.",
        "In one of Bronson Howard’s plays, a man the police are after\nconspires with his comrades to get him safely through the cordon\nof guards by pretending that he is dead.  They carry him out, his\nface covered with a cloth.  A policeman halts them–not a word is\nspoken–and the policeman turns down the cover from the face.\nDramatic as this all is, charged as it is with meaning to the man\nthere on the stretcher and to his comrades, there is even more\nportentous meaning in the facial expression of the policeman as\nhe reverently removes his helmet and motions the bearers to go\non–the man has really died.",
        "The movements are as simple and unagitated as one could imagine,\nand not one word is spoken, yet could you conceive of anything\nmore dramatic?  Again, one of the master-strokes in Bulwer-Lytton’s\n\"Richelieu” is where the Cardinal escapes from the swords of his\nenemies who rush into his sleeping apartments to slay him, by lying\ndown on his bed with his hands crossed upon his breast, and by his\nward’s lover (but that instant won to loyalty to Richelieu)\nannouncing to his fellow conspirators that they have come too\nlate–old age has forestalled them, “Richelieu is dead.”",
        "The only difference between the sublime and the ridiculous is the\nproverbial step.  The sad and the funny are merely a difference\nof opinion, of viewpoint.  Tragedy and comedy are only ways of\nlooking at things.  Often it is but a difference of to whom the\ncircumstance happens, whether it is excruciatingly funny or\nunutterably sad.  If you are the person to whom it happens, there\nis no argument about it–it is sad; but the very same thing happening\nto another person would be–funny.",
        "Take for example, the everyday occurrence of a high wind and a\nflying hat:  If the hat is yours, you chase it with unutterable\nthoughts–not the least being the consciousness that hundreds may\nbe laughing at you–and if, just as you are about to seize the\nhat, a horse steps on it, you feel the tragedy of going all the\nway home without a hat amid the stares of the curious, and the\nsorrow of having to spend your good money to buy another.",
        "But let that hat be not yours but another’s and not you but somebody\nelse be chasing it, and the grins will play about your mouth until\nyou smile.  Then let the horse step on the hat and squash it into\na parody of a headgear, just as that somebody else is about to\nretrieve it–and you will laugh outright.  As Elizabeth Woodbridge\nin summing up says, “the whole matter is seen to be dependent on\nperception of relations and the assumption of a standard of\nreference.”",
        "Incidentally the foregoing example is a very clear instance of the\ncomic effect that, like the serious or tragic effect, is achieved\nwithout words.  Any number of examples of comedy which secure their\neffect without action will occur to anyone, from the instance of\nthe lackadaisical Englishman who sat disconsolately on the race\ntrack fence, and welcomed the jockey who had ridden the losing\nhorse that had swept away all his patrimony, with these words:\n\"Aw, I say, what detained you?” [1] to the comedy that was achieved\nwithout movement or words in the expressive glance that the owner\nof the crushed headgear gave the guileless horse.",
        "[1] It would seem needless to state categorically that the sources\nof humor, and the technical means by which comedy is made comic,\nhave no place in the present discussion.  We are only concerned\nwith the flashes by which comedy, like tragedy, is revealed.",
        "Precisely as the tragic and the serious depend for their best\neffects upon character-revealing flashes and the whole train of\nincidents which led up to the instant and lead away from it, does\nthe comic depend upon the revealing flash that is the essence of\nthe dramatic, the veritable soul of the stage.",
        "No matter by what technical means dramatic effect is secured,\nwhether by the use of words and agitated movement, or without\nmovement, or without words, or sans both, matters not; the\nilluminating flash which reveals the thought behind it all, the\nmeaning to the characters and their destiny–in which the audience\nis breathlessly interested because they have all unconsciously\ntaken sides–is what makes the dramatic.  Let me repeat:  It is not\nthe incident, whatever it may be, that is dramatic, but the\nilluminating flash that reveals to the minds of the audience the\nmeaning of it.",
        "Did you ever stand in front of a newspaper office and watch the\nboard on which a baseball game, contested perhaps a thousand miles\naway, is being played with markers and a tiny ball on a string?\nThere is no playing field stretching its cool green diamond before\nthat crowd, there are no famous players present, there is no crowd\nof adoring fans jamming grand stand and bleachers; there is only\na small board, with a tiny ball swaying uncertainly on its string,\nan invisible man to operate it, markers to show the runs, and a\nlittle crowd of hot, tired men and office boys mopping their faces\nin the shadeless, dirty street.  There’s nothing pretty or pleasant\nor thrillingly dramatic about this.",
        "But wait until the man behind the board gets the flashes that tell\nhim that a Cravath has knocked the ball over the fence and brought\nin the deciding run in the pennant race!  Out on the board the\nlittle swaying ball flashes over the mimic fence, the tiny piece\nof wood slips to first and chases the bits of wood that represent\nthe men on second and third–home! “Hurray!  Hurray!!  Hurray!!!\"\nyell those weary men and office boys, almost bursting with delight.\nOver what?  Not over the tiny ball that has gone back to swaying\nuncertainly on its string, not over the tiny bits of board that\nare now shoved into their resting place, not even over those\nruns–but over what those runs mean!",
        "And so the playlet writer makes his audience go wild with delight–\nnot by scenery, not by costumes, not by having famous players, not by\nbeautifully written speeches, not even by wonderful scenes that\nflash the dramatic, but by what those scenes in the appealing story\nmean to the characters and their destiny, whereby each person in\nthe audience is made to be as interested as though it were to him\nthese things were happening with all their dramatic meaning of\nsadness or gladness.",
        "However, it is to the dramatic artist only that ability is given\nto breathe nobility into the whole and to charge the singleness\nof effect with a vitality which marks a milestone in countless\nlives.",
        "In this chapter we have found that the essence of drama is conflict–\na clash of wills and its outcome; that the dramatic consists in those\nflashes which reveal life at its significant, crucial moments; and\nthat the dramatic method is the way of telling the story with such\neconomy of attention that it is comprehended by means of those\nilluminating flashes which both reveal character and show in an\ninstant all that led up to the crisis as well as what will follow.",
        "Now let us combine these three doctrines in the following definition,\nwhich is peculiarly applicable to the playlet:",
        "Drama–whether it be serious or comic in tone–is a representation\n  of reality arranged for action, and having a plot which is\n  developed to a logical conclusion by the words and actions of\n  its characters and showing a single situation of big human\n  interest; the whole is told in a series of revealing flashes of\n  which the final illuminating revelation rounds out the entire\n  plot and leaves the audience with a single vivid impression.",
        "Finally, we found that the physical movements of the characters\noften have nothing to do with securing dramatic effect, and that\neven words need not of necessity be employed.  Hence dramatic\neffect in its final analysis depends upon what meaning the various\nminor scenes and the final big situation have for the characters\nand their destinies, and that this dramatic effect depends,\nfurthermore, upon the big broad meaning which it bears to the minds\nof the audience, who have taken sides and feel that the chief\ncharacter’s life and destiny represent their own, or what they\nwould like them to be, or fear they might be.  In the next chapter\nwe shall see how the dramatic spirit is given form by plot structure.",
        "In the chapter on the germ idea we saw that the theme or subject\nof a playlet is a problem that must be solved with complete\nsatisfaction.  In this chapter we shall see how the problem–which\nis the first creeping form of a plot–is developed and expanded\nby the application of formal elements and made to grow into a plot.\nAt the same time we shall see how the dramatic element of\nplot–discussed in the preceding chapter–is given form and direction\nin logical expression.",
        "You will recall that our consideration of the germ idea led us\nfarther afield than a mere consideration of a theme or subject,\nor even of the problem–as we agreed to call the spark that makes\nthe playlet go.  In showing how a playlet writer gets an idea and\nhow his mind works in developing it, we took the problem of “The\nSystem” and developed it into a near-plot form.  It may have seemed\nto you at the time that the problem we assumed for the purpose of\nexposition was worked out very carefully into a plot, but if you\nwill turn back to it now, you will realize how incomplete the\nelaboration was–it was no more complete than any germ idea should\nbe before you even consider spending time to build it into a\nplaylet.",
        "Let us now determine definitely what a playlet plot is, consider\nits structural elements and then take one of the fine examples of\na playlet in the Appendix and see how its plot is constructed.",
        "The plot of a playlet is its story.  It is the general outline,\nthe plan, the skeleton which is covered by the flesh of the\ncharacters and clothed by their words.  If the theme or problem\nis the heart that beats with life, then the scenery amid which the\nanimated body moves is its habitation, and the dramatic spirit is\nthe soul that reveals meaning in the whole.",
        "To hazard a definition:",
        "A playlet plot is a sequence of events logically developed out\n  of a theme or problem, into a crisis or entanglement due to a\n  conflict of the characters’ wills, and then logically untangled\n  again, leaving the characters in a different relation to each\n  other–changed in themselves by the crisis.",
        "Note that a mere series of incidents does not make a plot–the\npresence of crisis is absolutely necessary to plot.  If the series\nof events does not develop a complication that changes the characters\nin themselves and in their relations to each other, there can be\nno plot.  If this is so, let us now take the sequence of events\nthat compose the story of “The Lollard” [1] and see what constitutes\nthem a plot.  I shall not restate its story, only repeat it in the\nexamination of its various points [2].",
        "[1] Edgar Allan Woolf’s fine satirical comedy to be found in the\nAppendix.",
        "[2] As a side light, you see how a playlet theme differs from a\nplaylet plot.  You will recall that in the chapter on “The Germ\nIdea,” the theme of The Lollard was thus stated in terms of a\nplaylet problem:  “A foolish young woman may leave her husband\nbecause she has ’found him out,’ yet return to him when she discovers\nthat another man is no better than he is.”  Compare this brief\nstatement with the full statement of the plot given hereafter.",
        "The coming of Angela Maxwell to Miss Carey’s door at 2 A.M.–unusual\nas is the hour–is just an event; the fact that Angela has left\nher husband, Harry, basic as it is, is but little more than an\nevent; the entrance of the lodger, Fred Saltus, is but another\nevent, and even Harry Maxwell’s coming in search of his wife is\nmerely an event–for if Harry had sat down and argued Angela out\nof her pique, even though Fred were present, there would have been\nno complication, save for the cornerstone motive of her having\nleft him.  If this sequence of events forms merely a mildly\ninteresting narrative, what, then, is the complication that weaves\nthem into a plot?",
        "The answer is, in Angela’s falling in love with Fred’s broad\nshoulders, wealth of hair and general good looks–this complication\ndevelops the crisis out of Harry’s wanting Angela.  If Harry hadn’t\ncared, there would have been no drama–the drama comes from Harry’s\nwanting Angela when Angela wants Fred; Angela wants something that\nruns counter to Harry’s will–there is the clash of wills out\nof which flashes the dramatic.",
        "But still there would be no plot–and consequently no playlet–if\nHarry had acknowledged himself beaten after his first futile\ninterview with Angela.  The entanglement is there–Harry has to\nuntangle it.  He has to win Angela again–and how he does it, on\nMiss Carey’s tip, you may know from reading the playlet.  But, if\nyou have read it, did you realize the dramatic force of the unmasking\nof Fred–accomplished without (explanatory) words, merely by making\nFred run out on the stage and dash back into his room again? There\nis a fine example of the revealing flash!  This incident–made big\nby the dramatic–is the ironical solvent that loosens the warp of\nAngela’s will and prepares her for complete surrender.  Harry’s\nentrance in full regimentals–what woman does not love a uniform?–\nis merely the full rounding out of the plot that ends with Harry’s\ncarrying his little wife home to happiness again.",
        "But, let us pursue this examination further, in the light of the\npreceding chapter.  There would have been no drama if the meaning\nof these incidents had not–because Angela is a “character” and\nHarry one, too–been inherent in them.  There would have been no\nplot, nothing of dramatic spirit, if Harry had not been made by\nthose events to realize his mistake and Angela had not been made\nto see that Harry was “no worse” than another man.  It is the\nchange in Harry and the change in Angela that changes their\nrelations to each other–therein lies the essence of the plot. [1]",
        "[1] Unfortunately, the bigger, broader meaning we all read into\nthis satire of life, cannot enter into our consideration of the\nstructure of plot.  It lies too deep in the texture of the\nplaywright’s mind and genius to admit of its being plucked out by\nthe roots for critical examination.  The bigger meaning is there–we\nall see it, and recognize that it stamps The Lollard as good drama.\nEach playwright must work out his own meanings of life for himself\nand weave them magically into his own playlets; this is something\nthat cannot be added to a man, that cannot be satisfactorily\nexplained when seen, and cannot be taken away from him.",
        "Now, having determined what a plot is, let us take up its structural\nparts and see how these clearly understood principles make the\nconstruction of a playlet plot in a measure a matter of clear\nthinking.",
        "We must swerve for a moment and cut across lots, that we may touch\nevery one of the big structural elements of plot and relate them\nwith logical closeness to the playlet, summing them all up in the\nend and tying them closely into–what I hope may be–a helpful\ndefinition, on the last page of this chapter.",
        "The first of the structural parts that we must consider before we\ntake up the broader dramatic unities, is the seemingly obvious one\nthat a plot has a beginning, a middle and an ending.",
        "There has been no clearer statement of this element inherent in\nall plots, than that made by Aristotle in his famous twenty-century\nold dissection of tragedy; he says:",
        "“Tragedy is an imitation of an action, that is complete and whole,\nand of a certain magnitude (not trivial). . . .  A whole is that\nwhich has a beginning, middle and end.  A beginning is that which\ndoes not itself follow anything by causal necessity, but after\nwhich something naturally is or comes to be.  An end, on the\ncontrary, is that which itself naturally follows some other thing,\neither by necessity or in the regular course of events, but has\nnothing to follow it.  A middle is that which naturally follows\nsomething as some other thing follows it.  A well-constructed plot,\ntherefore, must neither begin nor end at haphazard, but conform\nto the type here described.” [1]",
        "[1] Aristotle, Poetics VII.",
        "Let us state the first part of the doctrine in this way:",
        "Although life knows neither a beginning nor an end–not your life\nnor mine, but the stream of unseparate events that make up\nexistence–a work of art, like the playlet, must have both.  The\nbeginning of any event in real life may lie far back in history;\nits immediate beginnings, however, start out closely together and\ndistinctly in related causes and become more indistinctly related\nthe farther back they go.  Just where you should consider the event\nthat is the crisis of your playlet has its beginning, depends upon\nhow you want to tell it–in other words, it depends upon you.  No\none can think for you, but there are one or two observations upon\nthe nature of plot-beginnings that may be suggestive.",
        "In the first place, no matter how carefully the dramatic material\nhas been severed from connection with other events, it cannot be\nconsidered entirely independent.  By the very nature of things,\nit must have its roots in the past from which it springs, and these\nroots–the foundations upon which the playlet rises–must be\npresented to the audience at the very beginning.",
        "If you were introducing a friend of yours and his sister and brother\nto your family, who had never met them before, you would tell which\none was your particular friend, what his sister’s name was, and\nhis brother’s name, too, and their relationship to your friend.\nAnd, if the visit were unexpected, you would–naturally and\nunconsciously–determine how they happened to come and how long\nyou might have the pleasure of entertaining them; in fact, you\nwould fix every fact that would give your family a clear understanding\nof the event of their presence.  In other words, you would very\ninformally and delicately establish their status, by outlining\ntheir relations to you and to each other, so that your family might\nhave a clear understanding of the situation they were asked to\nface.",
        "This is precisely what must be done at the very beginning of a\nplaylet–the friends, who are the author’s characters, must be\nintroduced to his interested family, the audience, with every bit\nof information that is necessary to a clear understanding of the\nplaylet’s situation.  These are the roots from which the playlet\nsprings–the premise of its problem.  Precisely as “The Lollard\"\ndeclares in its opening speeches who Miss Carey is and who Angela\nMaxwell is, and that Angela is knocking at Miss Carey’s door at\ntwo o’clock in the morning because she has left Harry, her husband,\nafter a quarrel the roots of which lie in the past, so every playlet\nmust state in its very first speeches, the “whos” and “whys\"–the\npremises–out of which the playlet logically develops.",
        "The prologue of “The Villain Still Pursued Her” is an excellent\nillustration of this point.  When this very funny travesty was\nfirst produced, it did not have a prologue.  It began almost\nprecisely as the full-stage scene begins now, and the audience did\nnot know whether to take it seriously or not.  The instant he\nwatched the audience at the first performance, the author sensed\nthe problem he had to face.  He knew, then, that he would have to\ntell the next audience and every other that the playlet is a farce,\na roaring travesty, to get the full value of laughter that lies\nin the situations.  He pondered the matter and saw that if the\nannouncement in plain type on the billboards and in the program\nthat his playlet was a travesty was not enough, he would have to\ntell the audience by a plain statement from the stage before his\nplaylet began.  So he hit upon the prologue that stamps the act\nas a travesty in its very first lines, introduces the characters\nand exposes the roots out of which the action develops so clearly\nthat there cannot possibly be any mistake.  And his reward was the\nmaking over of an indifferent success into one of the most successful\ntravesties in vaudeville.",
        "This conveying to the audience of the knowledge necessary to enable\nthem to follow the plot is technically known as “exposition.”  It\nis one of the most important parts of the art of construction–indeed,\nit is a sure test of a playwright’s dexterity.  While there are\nvarious ways of offering preliminary information in the long\ndrama–that is, it may be presented all at once in the opening\nscene of the first act, or homeopathically throughout the first\nact, or some minor bits of necessary information may be postponed\neven until the opening of the second act–there is only one way\nof presenting the information necessary to the understanding of\nthe playlet:  It must all be compressed into the very first speeches\nof the opening scene.",
        "The clever playlet writer is advertised by the ease–the\nsimplicity–with which he condenses every bit of the exposition\ninto the opening speeches.  You are right in the middle of things\nbefore you realize it and it is all done so skillfully that its\nstraightforwardness leaves never a suspicion that the simplicity\nis not innate but manufactured; it seems artless, yet its artlessness\nis the height of art.  The beginning of a playlet, then, must\nconvey to the audience every bit of information about the characters\nand their relations to each other that is necessary for clear\nunderstanding.  Furthermore, it must tell it all compactly and\nswiftly in the very first speeches, and by the seeming artlessness\nof its opening events it must state the problem so simply that\nwhat follows is foreshadowed and seems not only natural but\ninevitable.",
        "For the purpose of perfect understanding, I would define the\n\"middle” of a playlet as that part which carries the story on from\nthe indispensable introduction to and into the scene of final\nsuspense–the climax–in which the chief character’s will breaks\nor triumphs and the end is decided.  In “The Lollard” this would\nbe from the entrance of Fred Saltus and his talk with Angela, to\nMiss Carey’s exposure of Fred’s “lollardness,” which breaks down\nAngela’s determination by showing her that her husband is no worse\nthan Fred and makes it certain that Harry has only to return to\nhis delightful deceptions of dress to carry her off with him home.",
        "(a) The “Exciting Force.” The beginning of the action that we\nhave agreed to call the middle of a playlet, is technically termed\n\"the exciting force.”  The substance of the whole matter is this:\nRemember what your story is and tell it with all the dramatic force\nwith which you are endowed.",
        "Perhaps the most common, and certainly the very best, place to\n\"start the trouble\"–to put the exciting force which arouses the\ncharacters to conflict–is the very first possible instant after\nthe clear, forceful and foreshadowing introduction.  The introduction\nhas started the action of the story, the chief characters have\nshown what they are and the interest of the audience has been\nawakened.  Now you must clinch that interest by having something\nhappen that is novel, and promises in the division of personal\ninterests which grow out of it to hold a punch that will stir the\nsympathies legitimately and deeply.",
        "(b) The “Rising Movement.” This exciting force is the beginning\nof what pundits call “the rising movement\"–in simple words, the\naction which from now on increases in meaning vital to the characters\nand their destinies.  What happens, of course, depends upon the\nmaterial and the treatment, but there is one point that requires\na moment’s discussion here, although closely linked with the ability\nto seize upon the dramatic–if it is not, itself, the heart of the\ndramatic.  This important point is, that in every story set for\nthe stage, there are certain",
        "(c) Scenes that Must be Shown.  From the first dawn of drama\nuntil today, when the motion pictures are facing the very same\nnecessity, the problem that has vexed playwrights most is the\nselection of what scenes must be shown.  These all-important scenes\nare the incidents of the story or the interviews between characters\nthat cannot be recounted by other characters.  Call them dramatic\nscenes, essential scenes, what you will, if they are not shown\nactually happening, but are described by dialogue–the interest\nof the audience will lag and each person from the first seat in\nthe orchestra to the last bench in the gallery will be disappointed\nand dissatisfied.  For instance:",
        "If, instead of Fred Saltus’ appearing before the audience and\nhaving his humorously thoughtless but nevertheless momentous talk\nwith Angela in which Angela falls in love with him, the interview\nhad been told the audience by Miss Carey, there would have been\nno playlet.  Nearly as important is the prologue of “The Villian\nStill Pursued Her\"; Mr. Denvir found it absolutely necessary to\nshow those characters to the audience, so that they might see them\nwith their own eyes in their farcical relations to each other,\nbefore he secured the effect that made his playlet.  Turn to “The\nSystem” and try to find even one scene there shown that could be\nreplaced by narrative dialogue and you will see once more how\nimportant are the “scenes that must be shown.”",
        "One of the all-rules-in-one for writing drama that I have heard,\nthough I cannot now recall what playwright told me, deals with\nprecisely this point.  He expressed it this way:  “First tell your\naudience what you are going to do, then show it to them happening,\nand then tell ’em it has happened!”  You will not make a mistake,\nof course, if you show the audience those events in which the\ndramatic conflict enters.  The soul of a playlet is the clash of\nthe wills of the characters, from which fly the revealing flashes;\na playlet, therefore, loses interest for the audience when the\nscenes in which those wills clash and flash revealingly are not\nshown.",
        "It is out of such revealing scenes that the rising movement grows,\nas Freytag says, “with a progressive intensity of interest.”  But,\nnot only must the events progress and the climax be brought nearer,\nbut the scenes themselves must broaden with force and revealing\npower.  They must grow until there comes one big scene–\"big” in\nevery way–somewhere on the toes of the ending, a scene next to\nthe last or the last itself.",
        "(d) The Climax.  Here is where the decisive blow is struck in a\nmoment when the action becomes throbbing and revealing in every\nword and movement.  In “The Lollard” it is when Fred makes his\nrevealing dash through the room–this is the dramatic blow which\nbreaks Angela’s infatuation.  It is the crowning point of the\ncrowning scene in which the forces of the playlet culminate, and\nthe “heart wallop\"–as Tom Barry calls it [1]–is delivered and\nthe decision is won and made.",
        "[1] Vaudeville Appeal and the “Heart Wallop,” by Tom Barry, author\nof The Upstart and Brother Fans, an interesting article in The\nDramatic Mirror of December 16, 1914.  For this and other valuable\ninformation I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness and to express\nmy thanks to The Dramatic Mirror and its courteous Vaudeville\nEditor, Frederick James Smith.",
        "Whatever this decision may be and however it is won and made, the\nclimax must be first of all a real climax–it must be “big,” whether\nit be a comedy scream or the seldom-seen tragic tear.  Big in\nmovement and expression it must be, depending for effect not on\nwords but on the revealing flash; it must be the summit of the\naction; it must be the event toward which the entire movement has\nbeen rising; it must be the fulfillment of what was foreshadowed;\nit must be keen, quick, perfectly logical and flash the illuminating\nrevelation, as if one would say, “Here, this is what I’ve kept you\nwaiting for–my whole reason for being.”  Need I say that such a\nclimax will be worth while?",
        "And now, as the climax is the scene toward which every moment of\nthe playlet–from the first word of the introduction and the first\nscene-statement of the playlet’s problem–has been motivated, and\ntoward which it has risen and culminated, so also the climax holds\nwithin itself the elements from which develops the ending.",
        "For the purpose of clearness, let me define the ending of a playlet\nas a scene that lies between the climax or culminating scene–in\nwhich the audience has been made to feel the coming-to-an-end\neffect–and the very last word on which the curtain descends.  If\nyou have ever watched a sailor splicing a rope, you will know what\nI mean when I say that the worker, reaching for the loose ends to\nfinish the job off neatly, is like the playlet writer who reaches\nhere and there for the playlet’s loose ends and gathers them all\nup into a neat, workmanlike finish.  The ending of a playlet must\nnot leave unfulfilled any promises of the premise, but must fulfill\nthem all satisfyingly.",
        "The characteristics of a good playlet ending–besides the completeness\nwith which the problem has been “proved” and the satisfyingness\nwith which it all rounds out–are terseness, speed and “punch.\"\nIf the climax is a part of the playlet wherein words may not be\nsquandered, the ending is the place where words–you will know\nwhat I mean–may not be used at all.  Everything that must be\nexplained must be told by means which reach into the spectator’s\nmemory of what has gone before and make it the positive pole of\nthe battery from which flash the wireless messages from the scene\nof action.  As Emerson defined character as that which acts by\nmere presence without words, let me define the ending of a playlet\nas that which acts without words by the simple bringing together\nof the characters in their new relations.",
        "The climax has said to the audience, “Here, this is what I’ve kept\nyou waiting for–my whole reason for being,” therefore the ending\ncannot dally–it must run swiftly to the final word.  There is no\nexcuse for the ending to linger over anything at all–the shot has\nbeen fired and the audience waits only for the smoke to clear away,\nthat it may see how the bull’s-eye looks.  The swifter you can blow\nthe smoke away, show them that you’ve hit the bull’s-eye dead in the\ncentre, and bow yourself off amid their pleased applause, the better\nyour impression will be.",
        "Take these three examples:",
        "When Fred Saltus dashes revealingly across the stage and back into\nhis room again, “The Lollard’s” climax is reached; and as soon\nas Angela exclaims “What ’a lollard’ that is!” there’s a ring\nat the door bell and in comes Harry to win Angela completely with\nhis regimentals and to carry her off and bring the curtain down–\nin eight very short speeches.",
        "In “The System,” the climax arrives when the honest Inspector\norders Dugan arrested and led away.  Then he gives “The Eel” and\nGoldie their freedom and exits with a simple “Good Night\"–and the\ncurtain comes down–all in seven speeches.",
        "The climax of “Blackmail” seems to come when Fallon shoots Mohun\nand Kelly breaks into the room–to the curtain it is seven\nspeeches.  But the real climax is reached when Kelly shouts over\nthe telephone “Of course, in self-defense, you fool, of course,\nin self-defense.”  This is–the last speech.",
        "Convincing evidence, is this not, of the speed with which the\ncurtain must follow the climax?",
        "And so we have come, to this most important point–the “finish\"\nor “the curtain,” as vaudeville calls it.  The very last thing\nthat must be shown, and the final word that must be said before\nthe curtain comes down, are the last loose ends of the plot which\nmust be spliced into place–the final illuminating word to round\nout the whole playlet humanly and cleverly.  “The Lollard” goes\nback to Miss Carey’s sleep, which Angela’s knock on the door\ninterrupted:  “Now, thank Gawd, I’ll get a little sleep,” says Miss\nCarey as she puts out the light.  A human, an everyday word it is,\nspoken like a reminiscent thrill–and down comes the curtain amid\nlaughter and applause.  A fine way to end.",
        "But not the only way–let us examine “The System.”",
        "“Well, we’re broke again,” says Goldie tearfully.  “We can’t go\nWest now, so there’s no use packing.”  Now, note the use of business\nin the ending, and the surprise.  The Eel goes stealthily to the\nwindow L, looks out, and pulls the dictograph from the wall.  Then\nhe comes down stage to Goldie who is sitting on the trunk and has\nwatched him.  He taps her on the shoulder, taking Dugan’s red\nwallet out of his pocket.  “Go right ahead and pack,” says The\nEel, while Goldie looks astonished and begins to laugh.  The\naudience, too, look astonished and begin to laugh when they see\nthat red wallet.  It is a surprise–a surprise so cleverly constructed\nthat it hits the audience hard just above the laughter-and-applause-belt–\na surprise that made the act at least twenty-five per cent better\nthan it would have been without it.  And from it we may now draw\nthe “rules” for the use of that most helpful and most dangerous\nelement, surprise in the vaudeville finish:",
        "Note first, that it was entirely logical for The Eel to steal the\nwallet–he is a pickpocket.  Second, that the theft of the wallet\nis not of trivial importance to Goldie’s destiny and to his–they\nare “broke” and they must get away; the money solves all their\nproblems.  And third, note that while The Eel’s possession of the\nwallet is a surprise, the wallet itself is not a surprise–it\nhas first played a most important part in the tempting of Goldie\nand has been shown to the audience not once but many times; and\nits very color–red–makes it instantly recognizable; the spectators\nknow what it contains and what its contents mean to the destinies\nof both The Eel and Goldie–it is only that The Eel has it, that\nconstitutes the surprise.",
        "Now I must sound a warning against striving too hard after a\nsurprise finish.  The very nature of many playlets makes it\nimpossible to give them such a curtain.  If you have built up a\nstory which touches the heart and brings tears to the eyes, and\nthen turn it all into a joke, the chances are the audience will\nfeel that their sympathies have been outraged, and so the playlet\nwill fail.  For instance, one playlet was ruined because right on\ntop of the big, absorbing climax two of the characters who were\nthen off stage stuck their heads in at the door and shouted at the\nhero of the tense situation, “April Fool.”",
        "Therefore, the following may be considered as an important “rule\";\na playlet that touches the heart should never end with a trick or\na surprise. [1]",
        "[1] See Chapter XVIII, section III, par. 4.",
        "Now, let me sum up these four elements of surprise:",
        "A surprise finish must be fitting, logical, vitally important,\n  and revealingly dramatic; if you cannot give a playlet a\n  surprise-finish that shall be all of these four things at once,\n  be content with the simpler ending.",
        "The importance of a playlet’s ending is so well understood in\nvaudeville that the insistence upon a “great finish” to every\nplaylet has sometimes seemed to be over-insistence, for, important\nas it is, it is no more important than a “great opening” and “great\nscenes.”  The ending is, of course, the final thing that quickens\napplause, and, coming last and being freshest in the mind of the\naudience, it is more likely to carry just a fair act to success\nthan a fine act is likely to win with the handicap of a poor finish.\nBut, discounting this to be a bit under the current valuation of\n\"great finishes,” we still may round out this discussion of the\nplaylet’s three important parts, with this temperate sentence:",
        "A well constructed playlet plot is one whose Beginning states\n  the premises of its problem clearly and simply, whose Middle\n  develops the problem logically and solves the entanglement in a\n  “big” scene, and whose Ending rounds out the whole satisfyingly–\n  with a surprise, if fitting.",
        "But, temperate and helpful as this statement of a well constructed\nplot may be, there is something lacking in it.  And that something\nlacking is the very highest test of plot–lightly touched on at\nvarious times, but which, although it enters into a playwright’s\ncalculations every step of the way, could not be logically considered\nin this treatise until the structure had been examined as a whole:\nI mean the formidable-sounding, but really very simple dramatic\nunities.",
        "Now, but only for a moment, we must return to the straight line\nof investigation from which we swerved in considering the structural\nparts of a playlet plot.",
        "At the beginning of this chapter we saw that a simple narrative\nof events is made a plot by the addition of a crisis or entanglement,\nand its resolution or untying.  Now, the point I wish to present\nwith all the emphasis at my command, is that complication does not\nmean complexity.",
        "In other words, no matter how many events you place one after\nanother–no matter how you pile incident upon incident–you will\nnot have a plot unless you so inter-relate them that the removal\nof anyone event will destroy the whole story.  Each event must\ndepend on the one preceding it, and in turn form a basis for the\none following, and each must depend upon all the others so vitally\nthat if you take one away the whole collapses. [1]",
        "[1] See Aristotle, Poetics, Chapter VIII, and also Poe’s criticism,\nThe American Drama.",
        "(a) Unity of Hero is not Unity of Action. One of the great errors\ninto which the novice is likely to fall, is to believe that because\nhe makes every event which happens happen to the hero, he is\nobserving the rule of unity.  Nothing could be farther from the\ntruth–nothing is so detrimental to successful plot construction.\n[2]",
        "[2] See Freytag’s Technique of the Drama, p. 36.",
        "Aristotle tried to correct this evil, which he saw in the plays\nof the great Athenian poets, by saying:  “The action is the first\nand most important thing, the characters only second;” and, “The\naction is not given unity by being made to concern only one person.”",
        "Remember, unity of action means unity of story.",
        "(b) Double-Action is Dangerous to Unity.  If you have a scene\nin which two minor characters come together for a reason vital to\nthe plot, you must be extremely careful not to tell anything more\nthan the facts that are vital.  In long plays the use of what is\ncalled “double-action “–that is, giving to characters necessary\nto the plot an interest and a destiny separate from that of the\nchief characters–is, of course, recognized and productive of fine\nresults.  But, even in the five-act play, the use of double-action\nis dangerous.  For instance:  Shakespere developed Falstaff so\nhumorously that today we sometimes carelessly think of “Henry IV\"\nas a delightful comedy, when in reality it was designed as a serious\ndrama–and is most serious, when Falstaff’s lines are cut from the\nreading version to the right proportions for to-day’s stage effect.\nIf Shakespere nodded, it is a nod even the legitimate dramatist\nof today should take to heart, and the playlet writer–peculiarly\nrestricted as to time–must engrave deeply in his memory.",
        "The only way to secure unity of action is to concentrate upon your\nproblem or theme; to realize that you are telling a story; to\nremember that each character, even your hero, is only a pawn to\nadvance the story; and to cut away rigorously all non-essential\nevents.  If you will bear in mind that a playlet is only as good\nas its plot, that a plot is a story and that you must give to\nyour story, as has been said, “A completeness–a kind of universal\ndovetailedness, a sort of general oneness,” you will have little\ndifficulty in observing the one playlet rule that should never be\nbroken–Unity of action.",
        "The second of the classical unities, unity of time, is peculiarly\nperplexing, if you study to “understand” and not merely to write.\nBriefly–for I must reiterate that our purpose is practice and not\ntheory–the dramatists of every age since Aristotle have quarreled\nover the never-to-be-settled problem of what space of time a play\nshould be permitted to represent.  Those who take the stand that\nno play should be allowed to show an action that would require\nmore than twenty-four hours for the occurrences in real life, base\ntheir premise on the imitative quality of the stage, rather than\nupon the selective quality of art.  While those who contend that\na play may disregard the classical unity of time, if only it\npreserves the unity of action, base their contention upon the fact\nthat an audience is interested not in time at all–but in story.\nIn other words, a play preserves the only unity worth preserving\nwhen it deals with the incidents that cause a crisis and ends by\nshowing its effect, no matter whether the action takes story-years\nto occur or happens all in a story-hour.",
        "If we were studying the long drama it might be worth our while to\nconsider the various angles of this ancient dispute, but, fortunately,\nwe have a practical and, therefore, better standard by which to\nstate this unity in its application to the playlet.  Let us approach\nthe matter in this way:",
        "Vaudeville is variety–it strives to compress into the space of\nabout two hours and a half a great number of different acts which\nrun the gamut of the entertainment forms, and therefore it cannot\nafford more than an average of twenty minutes to each.  This time\nlimit makes it difficult for a playlet to present effectively any\nstory that does not occur in consecutive minutes.  It has been\nfound that even the lowering of the curtain for one second to\ndenote the lapse of an hour or a year, has a tendency to distract\nthe minds of the audience from the story and to weaken the singleness\nof effect without which a playlet is nothing.",
        "On the other hand, this “rule” is not unbreakable:  a master\ncraftsman’s genius is above all laws.  In “The System” the first\nscene takes place in the evening; scene two, a little later the\nsame evening; and scene three later that same night.  The story\nis really continuous in time, but the story-time is not equal to\nthe playing-time even though this playlet consumes nearly twice\ntwenty minutes.  But, you will note, the scenery changes help to\nkeep the interest of the audience from flagging, and also stamp\nthe lapses of time effectively.",
        "A still greater violation of the “rule\"–if it were stated as\nabsolutely rigid–is to be found in Mr. Granville’s later act,\n\"The Yellow Streak,” written in collaboration with James Madison.\nHere scene two takes place later in the evening of the first scene,\nand the third scene after a lapse of four months.  But these two\nexceptions, out of many that might be cited, merely prove that\ndramatic genius can mold even the rigid time of the vaudeville\nstage to its needs.",
        "Of course, there is the possibility of foreshortening time to meet\nthe exigencies of vaudeville when the scene is not changed.  For\ninstance:  a character telephones that he will be right over and\nsolve the whole situation on which the punch of the playlet depends,\nand he enters five actual minutes later–although in real life it\nwould take an hour to make the trip.  This is an extreme instance,\nas time foreshortening goes, because it is one where the audience\nmight grasp the disparity, and is given for its side-light of\nwarning as well as for its suggestive value.",
        "More simple foreshortenings of time are found in many playlets\nwhere the effect of an hour-or-more of events is compressed into\nthe average twenty minutes.  As an example of this perfectly safe\nuse of shortening, note the quickness with which Harry returns to\nMiss Carey’s apartment when he goes out to change into his\nregimentals.  And as still safer foreshortenings, note the quickness\nwith which Fred Saltus enters after Miss Carey goes to bed leaving\nAngela on the couch; and the quickness with which Angela falls in\nlove with him–in fact, the entire compression inherent in the\ndramatic events which cannot be dissociated from time compression.",
        "A safe attitude for a playlet writer to take, is that all of his\naction shall mimic time reality as closely as his dramatic moment\nand the time-allowance of presentation will permit.  This is\nconsidered in all dramatic art to be the ideal.",
        "A good way to obviate disparaging comparison is to avoid reference\nto time–either in the dialogue or by the movements of events.",
        "To sum up the whole matter, a vaudeville playlet may be considered\nas preserving unity of time when its action occurs in continuous\nminutes of about the length the episode would take to occur in\nreal life.",
        "The commercial element of vaudeville often makes it inadvisable\nfor a playlet to show more than one scene–very often an otherwise\nacceptable playlet is refused production because the cost of\nsupplying special scenes makes it a bad business venture. [1]",
        "[1] See Chapter III.",
        "Yet it is permissible for a writer to give his playlet more than\none place of happening–if he can make his story so compact and\ngripping that it does not lose in effect by the unavoidable few\nseconds’ wait necessary to the changing of the scenery.  But, even\nif his playlet is so big and dramatic that it admits of a change\nof scenes, he must conform it to the obvious vaudeville necessity\nof scenic alternation. [2] With this scenic “rule” the matter of\nunity of place in the playlet turns to the question of a playwright’s\nart, which rules cannot limit.",
        "[2] See Chapter I.",
        "This third and last unity of the playlet may, however, for all\nsave the master-craftsman, be safely stated as follows:",
        "Except in rare instances a playlet should deal with a story that\nrequires but one set of scenery, thus conserving the necessities\nof commercial vaudeville, aiding the smooth running of a performance,\nand preserving the dramatic unity of place.",
        "We may now condense the three dramatic unities into a statement\npeculiarly applicable to the playlet–which would seem as though\nspecially designed to fulfill them all:",
        "A playlet preserves the dramatic unities when it shows one action\n  in one time and in one place.",
        "And now it may be worth while once more to sum up what I have said\nabout the elements of plot–of which the skeleton of every playlet\nmust be made up:",
        "A mere sequence of events is not a plot; to become a plot there\nmust develop a crisis or entanglement due to a conflict of the\ncharacters’ wills; the entanglement must be of such importance\nthat when it is untangled the characters will be in a different\nrelation to each other–changed in themselves by the crisis.  A\nplot is divided into three parts:  a Beginning, a Middle and an\nEnding.  The Beginning must state the premises of the playlet’s\nproblem clearly and simply; the Middle must develop the problem\nlogically and solve the entanglement in a “big” scene, and the\nEnding must round out the whole satisfyingly–with a surprise, if\nfitting.  A plot, furthermore, must be so constructed that the\nremoval of anyone of its component parts will be detrimental to\nthe whole.  It is told best when its action occurs in continuous\ntime of about the length the episode would take to occur in real\nlife and does not require the changing of scenery.  Thus will a\nplaylet be made to give the singleness of effect that is the height\nof playlet art.",
        "In this chapter the single word “character” must, of necessity,\ndo duty to express three different things.  First, by “characters,\"\nas used in the title, I mean what the programs sometimes more\nclearly express by the words “persons of the play.”  Second, in\nthe singular, it must connote what we all feel when we use the\nword in everyday life, as “he is a man of–good or bad–character.\"\nAnd third, and also in the singular, I would also have it connote,\nin the argot of the stage, “a character actor,” meaning one who\npresents a distinct type–as, say, a German character, or a French\ncharacter.  It is because of the suggestive advantage of having\none word to express these various things that the single term\n\"characters” is used as the title of this chapter.  But, that there\nmay be no possible confusion, I shall segregate the different\nmeanings sharply.",
        "In discussing how a playwright gets an idea, you will recall, we\nfound that there are two chief ways of fashioning the playlet:\nFirst, a plot may be fitted with characters; second, characters\nmay be fitted with a plot.  In other words, the plot may be made\nmost prominent, or the characters may be made to stand out above\nthe story.  You will also remember we found that the stage–the\nvaudeville quite as much as the legitimate–is “character-ridden,\"\nthat is, an actor who has made a pronounced success in the delineation\nof one character type forever afterward wants another play or\nplaylet “just like the last, but with a different plot,” so that\nhe can go right on playing the same old character.  This we saw\nhas in some cases resulted in the story being considered merely\nas a vehicle for a personality, often to the detriment of the\nplaylet.  Naturally, this leads us to inquire:  is there not some\njust balance between characters and plot which should be preserved?",
        "Were we considering merely dramatic theory, we would be perfectly\nright in saying that no play should be divisible into plot and\ncharacters, but that story and characters should be so closely\ntwinned that one would be unthinkable without the other.  As Brander\nMatthews says, “In every really important play the characters make\nthe plot, and the story is what it is merely because the characters\nare what they are.”  An exceptionally fine vaudeville example–one\nonly, it is agreeable to note, out of many that might be quoted\nfrom vaudeville’s past and present–that has but two persons in\nthe playlet is Will Cressy’s “The Village Lawyer.”  One is a\npenniless old lawyer who has been saving for years to buy a\nclarionet.  A woman comes in quest of a divorce.  When he has\nlistened to her story he asks twenty dollars advance fee.  Then\nhe persuades her to go back home–and hands the money back.  There\nis a splendid climax.  The old lawyer stands in the doorway of his\nshabby office looking out into the night.  “Well,” he sighs, “maybe\nI couldn’t play the darned thing anyway!”  If the lawyer had not\nbeen just what he was there would have been no playlet.  But vital\nas the indissoluble union of plot and characters is in theory, we\nare not discussing theory; we are investigating practice, and\npractice from the beginner’s standpoint, therefore let us approach\nthe answer to our question in this way:",
        "When you were a child clamoring for “a story” you did not care a\nsnap of your fingers about anything except “Once upon a time there\nwas a little boy–or a giant–or a dragon,” who did something.\nYou didn’t care what the character was, but whatever it was, it\nhad to do something, to be doing something all of the time.  Even\nwhen you grew to youth and were on entertainment bent, you cared\nnot so much what the characters in a story were, just so long as\nthey kept on doing something–preferably “great” deeds, such as\ncapturing a city or scuttling a ship or falling in love.  It was\nonly a little later that you came to find enjoyment in reading a\nbook or seeing a play in which the chief interest came from some\nperson who had admirable qualities or was an odd sort of person\nwho talked in an odd sort of way.  Was it George Cohan who said\n\"a vaudeville audience is of the mental age of a nine-year-old\nchild”?",
        "Theoretically and, of course, practically too, when it is possible,\nthe characters of a playlet should be as interesting as the plot.\nEach should vitally depend upon the other.  But, if you must choose\nwhether to sacrifice plot-interest or character-interest, save the\ninterest of plot every time.  As Aristotle says, “the action is\nthe first and most important thing, the characters only secondary.”",
        "How a playwright begins to construct a play, whether he fits a\nplot with characters, or fits characters with a plot, does not\nmatter.  What matters is how he ends.  If the story and the\ncharacters blend perfectly the result is an example of the highest\nart, but characters alone will never make a stage story–the playlet\nwriter must end with plot.  Story is for what the stage is made.\nPlot is the life blood of the playlet.  To vivify cold dramatic\nincidents is the province of playlet characters.",
        "While it is true that, no matter with what method he begins, a\nplaywright may end by having a successful playlet, the clearer way\nto understanding is for us to suppose that you have your plot and\nare striving to fit it with live people–therefore I shall assume\nthat such is the case.  For if the reverse were the case and the\ncharacters were all ready to fit with a plot, the question would\nbe primarily not of characters but of plot.",
        "How many people shall I have in my playlet? ought to be one of\nthe very first questions the writer asks, for enough has been said\nin the earlier chapters, it would seem, to establish the fact that\nvaudeville is first of all a commercial pursuit and after that an\nartistic profession.  While there can be no hard and fast rule as\nto the number of persons there may be in a playlet, business economy\ndictates that there shall be no more than the action of the playlet\npositively demands.  But before I say a short word about this\ngeneral “rule,” permit me to state another that comes fast upon\nits heels:  A really big playlet–big in theme, in grip of action,\nand in artistic effect–may have even thrice the number of characters\na “little” playlet may possess.  Merit determines the number.",
        "Let us find the reasons for these two general statements in this\nway:",
        "In “The Lollard” there are four persons, while in “The System “\nthere are thirteen speaking parts and a number of “supers.”  Would\nit then be correct to suppose that “The System” is a “bigger\"\nplaylet than “The Lollard”?  It would not be safe to assume any\nsuch judgment, for the circuit that booked “The System” may have\nbeen in need of a playlet using a large number of persons to make\nwhat is known as a “flash,” therefore the booking manager may have\ngiven orders that this playlet be built to make that flash, and\nthe total return to the producer might not have been any greater\nproportionally than the return to the producer of the numerically\nsmaller “The Lollard.”  Therefore of two playlets whose total\neffects are equal, the one having the lesser number of persons is\nthe better producing gamble, and for this reason is more likely\nto be accepted when offered for sale.",
        "If you will constantly bear in mind that you are telling a story\nof action and not of character, you will find very little difficulty\nin reducing the number of players from what you first supposed\nabsolutely necessary.  As just one suggestion:  If your whole playlet\nhangs on an important message to be delivered, the property man,\ndressed as a messenger boy, may hand in the message without a word.\nI have chosen this one monotonously often-seen example because it\nis suggestive of the crux of the problem–the final force of a\nplaylet is affected little by what the character says when he\ndelivers a vital message.  All that matters is the message itself.\nThe one thing to remember in reducing the number of characters to\nthe lowest possible number is–plot.",
        "Four Persons the Average.  While there are playlets ranging in\nnumber of characters from the two-person “The Village Lawyer,\"\nthrough “The Lollard’s” four, to “The System’s” thirteen speaking\nparts, and even more in rare instances, the average vaudeville\nplaylet employs four people.  But it is a fact of importance to\nnote that a three-person playlet can be sold more easily–I am\nassuming an equal standard of merit–than a four-person playlet.\nAnd, by the same law of demand, a two-person playlet wins a quicker\nmarket than a three-person playlet.  The reason for this average\nhas its rise in the demands of the dramatic, and not merely in\neconomy.  The very nature of the playlet makes it the more difficult\nto achieve dramatic effect the more the number of characters is\nreduced.  But while four persons are perfectly permissible in a\nplaylet designed for vaudeville’s commercial stage, the beginner\nwould do well to make absolutely sure that he has reduced his\ncharacters to their lowest number before he markets his playlet,\nand, if possible, make a three-person or a two-person offering.",
        "There would seem to be little need, in this day of wide curiosity\nabout all the forms of writing and those of playwriting in particular,\nto warn the beginner against straying far afield in search of\ncharacters whom he will not understand even when he finds them.\nYet this is precisely the fault that makes failures of many otherwise\ngood playlets.  The whole art of selecting interesting characters\nmay be summed up in one sentence–choose those that you know.  The\nmost interesting characters in the world are rubbing elbows with\nyou every day.",
        "Willard Mack–who developed into a successful legitimate playwright\nfrom vaudeville, and is best known, perhaps, for the expansion of\nhis vaudeville act, “Kick in,” into the long play of the same\nname–has this to say on the subject:  “I say to the ambitious\nplaywright, take the types you are familiar with.  Why go to the\nNorthwest, to New Orleans in the 40’s, to the court of Louis XIV,\nfor characters?  The milkman who comes to your door in the morning,\nthe motorman on the passing street car, the taxi driver, all have\ntheir human-interest stories.  Anyone of them would make a drama.\nI never attempt to write anything that has not suggested itself\nfrom something in real life.  I must know it has existed.” [1]",
        "[1] Willard Mack on the “Vaudeville Playlet,” The New York Dramatic\nMirror, March 3, 1915.",
        "Precisely as it is impossible to tell anyone how to grasp the\ndramatic and transplant it into a playlet, is it impossible to\nshow how to seize on character and transplant it to the stage.\nOnly remember that interesting characters are all about you, and\nyou will have little difficulty–if you have, as the French say,\nthe “flare.”",
        "It would seem that a playwright who has his plot all thought out\nwould experience little difficulty in fitting the characters of a\nplaylet into their waiting niches; it is easy, true enough–if his\nplot is perfectly dovetailed and motivated as to character.  By\nthis I mean, that in even a playlet in which plot rides the\ncharacters, driving them at its will to attain its end, logic must\nbe used.  And it certainly would not be logical to make your\ncharacters do anything which such persons would not do in real\nlife.  As there must be unity in plot, so must there be unity in\ncharacter.",
        "The persons in a playlet are not merely puppets, even if plot is\nmade to predominate.  They are–let us hope–live persons.  I do\nnot mean that you have transplanted living people to the stage,\nbut that you have taken the elements of character that you require\nout of life and have combined these into a consistent whole to\nform characters necessary to your playlet.  Therefore, you must\nbe careful to make each character uniform throughout.  You must\nnot demand of any character anything you have not laid down in tbe\npremises of your problem–which presupposes that each character\npossesses certain definite and logical characteristics which make\nthe plot what it is.",
        "Bearing this single requirement firmly in mind, you must so motivate\nyour plot that everything which occurs to a character rises out\nof that character’s personality; you must make the crisis the\noutward evidence of his inner being and the change which comes\nthrough the climax the result of inner change.  This was considered\nin the chapters on the dramatic and on plot construction and\nexpressed when I said:  It is the meaning hidden in the events\nthat makes the dramatic.  It is this inner meaning that lies in\nthe soul of the character himself which marks the change in his\nown character and his own outward life.",
        "IV.  CHARACTERIZATION",
        "How a playwright delineates character in the persons of his playlet,\nis at once the easiest thing to explain and the most difficult for\nwhich to lay down helpful methods, for while the novelist and the\nshort-story writer have three ways of telling their readers what\nmanner of man it is in whom he asks interest, the dramatist has\nbut two.",
        "First, a playwright may build up a characterization by having one\ncharacter tell another what sort of a person the third is.  Second,\nhe may make the character show by his own speech and actions what\nhe is.  This latter is the dramatic way, and peculiarly the playlet\nway.",
        "As the first method is perfectly plain in itself, I shall dismiss\nit with the suggestive warning that even this essentially undramatic\nmethod must partake of the dramatic to be most effective:  to get\nthe most out of one character’s describing a second to a third,\nthe reason for the disclosure must be bone-and-brawn a part of the\naction.",
        "The two elements of the dramatic method are:  First, the character\nmay disclose his inner being by his own words, and second, by his\nactions.",
        "The first is so intimately connected with the succeeding chapter\non dialogue that I shall postpone its consideration until then and\ndiscuss here the disclosure of character through action.",
        "When you meet a man whom you have never met before, you carry away\nwith you a somewhat complete impression.  Even though he has spoken\nbut a word or two, his appearance first of all, the cut of his\nclothes, his human twinkle, the way he lights his cigar, the\ncourteous way in which he gives precedence to another, or his rough\nway of “butting into” a conversation, all combine to give him a\npersonality distinct from every other man’s.  What he does not\ndisclose of himself by actions, you read into his personality\nyourself.  “First impressions are the strongest,” is a common\nsaying–we make them strong by reading character on sight, by\njumping at conclusions.  Man does not need to have a whole life\nlaid before him to form a judgment.  Little things are what drive\ncharacter impressions home.",
        "It is this human trait of which the playwright makes use in the\ndelineation of character.  The playlet writer has even less time\nthan the legitimate dramatist to stamp character.  He must seize\non the essentials, and with a few broad strokes make the character\nlive as distinct from all other men.",
        "For much of his characterization–aside from that absolutely\ninherent in the plot–the playlet writer depends upon the actor.\nBy the use of costumes and of make-up, the age and station in life,\neven the business by which a character earns his daily bread, are\nmade clear at a glance.  And by the trick of a twitching mouth, a\ntrembling hand, or a cunningly humble glance, the inner being is\nlaid bare, with the help of a few vital words which are made to\ndo duty to advance the story as well.",
        "In a word, the playwright and the actor work in partnership, with\nbroad strokes, relying upon the eager imagination of the audience\nto amplify the tiny sketch into a well-rounded, full personality.\nThis is the method simply stated.  It does not admit of the laying\ndown of precepts.",
        "In the old days of vaudeville the persons of a playlet were often\nnamed to fit their most prominent characteristic; for instance, a\nsneaky fellow would be named Sam Sly, and a pretty girl Madge\nDimples.  But with the change in fashion in the long play, the\nplaylet has relegated this symbolical method of naming characters\nto burlesque and the lurid types of melodrama, and even there it\nis going out of fashion.",
        "Today, names are carefully chosen to seem as life-like as do the\ncharacters themselves.  Instead of trying to express characteristics\nby a name, the very opposite effect is sought, except when the\ncharacter would in real life have a “monicker,” or the naming of\nthe character in the old way would serve to relate the act more\nclosely to its form and awaken pleasing reminiscences. [1] The\nmethod today is to select a name that shall fit a character in a\ngeneral way and yet be so unobtrusive that it will not be remarked.",
        "[1] See The System and My Old Kentucky Home, in the Appendix.",
        "Simple names are always the best.  The shorter they are the\nbetter–usually nicknames, if true to life and the character, have\na “homey” sort of sound that is worth securing.  Bill, and Jack,\nand Madge, and Flo, or anyone of a hundred others, sound less\nformidable than William, and James, and Margaret, and Florence.\nNames that are long and “romantic” are usually amusing; merely\nlisten to Algernon, Hortense, and Reginald Montmorency, and you\nhave to smile–and not always with pleasure.",
        "But for a name to be simple or short or unromantic does not solve\nthe problem for all cases.  A long “romantic” name might be the\nvery best one you could choose for a certain character. [1] The\nname you should select depends on what effect you wish to secure.\nNo one can tell you just what name to choose for a character you\nalone have in mind.",
        "[1] See The Villain Still Pursued Her in the Appendix.",
        "But do not make the mistake of pondering too long over the naming\nof your characters.  It is not the name that counts, it is the\ncharacter himself, and behind it all the action that has brought\nthe character into being–your gripping plot.",
        "And now, let us sum up this brief discussion of characters and\ncharacterization before we pass on to a consideration of dialogue.\nBecause of time-restriction, a playlet must depend for interest\nupon plot rather than upon character.  The average number of persons\nin a playlet is four.  Interesting characters are to be found\neverywhere, and the playlet writer can delineate those he rubs\nelbows with better than those he does not know well and therefore\ncannot fully understand.  The same unity demanded of a plot is\nrequired of a character–characters must be consistent.\nCharacterization is achieved by the dramatic method of letting\nactions speak for themselves, is done in broad strokes growing out\nof the plot itself, and is conveyed in close partnership with the\nactor by working on the minds of the audience who take a meagre\nfirst impression and instantly build it up into a full portrait.",
        "We have now come to one of the least important elements of the\nplaylet–yet a decorative element which wit and cleverness can\nmake exceedingly valuable.",
        "If it is true that scenery is the habitation in which the playlet\nmoves, that its problem is the heart beating with life, that the\ndramatic is the soul which shines with meaning through the whole,\nthat plot is the playlet’s skeleton which is covered by the flesh\nof the characters–then the dialogue is, indeed, merely a playlet’s\nclothes.  Clothes do not make a man, but the world gives him a\nreadier welcome who wears garments that fit well and are becoming.\nThis is the whole secret of dialogue–speeches that fit well and\nare becoming.",
        "It has been said that “Romeo and Juliet” played in English in any\ncountry would be enjoyed by everyone, even though they could not\nunderstand a word of what was said.  There is a story told about\na Slav in Pennsylvania who could not speak one word of English,\nbut who happened to come up from his work as a laborer in a coal\nmine just as the people were filing in to the performance of “The\nTwo Orphans,” and as he had nothing in particular to do, in he\nwent–and nearly broke up the performance by the loudness of his\nsobbing.  I shall never forget an experience of my own, when I\ntook a good French friend to see David Warfield in “The Music\nMaster\"; this young chap could not understand more than a word\nhere and there, but we were compelled to miss the last act because\nhe cried so hard during the famous lost-daughter scene that he was\nashamed to enter the theatre after the intermission.",
        "Every great play is, in the last analysis, a pantomime.  Words are\nunnecessary to tell a stage story that has its wellspring deep in\nthe emotions of the human heart.  Words can only embellish it.  A\ngreat pantomimist–a Mlle. Dazie, who played Sir James M. Barrie’s\n\"The Pantaloon” in vaudeville without speaking a word; a Pavlowa,\nwho dances her stories into the hearts of her audience; a Joe\nJackson, who makes his audiences roar with laughter and keeps them\nconvulsed throughout his entire act, with the aid of a dilapidated\nbicycle, a squeaky auto horn and a persistently annoying cuff–does\nnot need words to tell a story.",

        "[1] Reported in A Study of the Drama, by Brander Matthews.",
        "If it is true that a great play, being in its final analysis a\npantomime, is effective without dialogue, and if some famous\ndramatists thought so little of dialogue that they considered their\nplays all written before they wrote the dialogue, then speech must\nbe something that has little comparative value–something primarily\nemployed to aid the idea behind it, to add emphasis to plot–not\nto exist for itself.",
        "Dialogue makes the dramatic story clear, advances it, reveals\ncharacter, and wins laughter–all by five important means:",
        "(a) Dialogue Conveys Information of Basic Events at the Opening.\nAs we saw in the discussion of the structural elements of plot,\nthere are of necessity some points in the basic incidents chosen\nfor the story of a playlet that have their roots grounded in the\npast.  Upon a clear understanding of these prior happenings which\nmust be explained immediately upon the rise of the curtain, depends\nthe effect of the entire sequence of events and, consequently, the\nfinal and total effect of the playlet.  To “get this information\nover” the characters are made to tell of them as dramatically as\npossible.  For instance:",
        "Angela Maxwell knocks on Miss Carey’s door the instant the curtain\nrises on “The Lollard,” and as soon as Miss Carey opens the door\nAngela says:  “Listen, you don’t know me, but I’ve just left my\nhusband.”  And the dialogue goes on to tell why she left Harry,\nclearly stating the events that the audience must know in order\nto grasp the meaning of those that follow.",
        "At the very beginning of a playlet the dialogue must be especially\nclear, vividly informing and condensed.  By “condensed,” I meant\nthe dialogue must be tense, and supported by swift action–it must\nwithout delay have done with the unavoidable explanations, and\nquickly get into the rising movement of events.",
        "(b) Dialogue Brings out the Incidents Clearly.  Never forgetting\nthat action makes dialogue but that dialogue never makes action,\nlet us take the admirable surprise ending of “The System,” for an\nexample:",
        "The Inspector has left, after giving The Eel and Goldie their\nfreedom and advising them to clear out and start life anew.  The\naudience knows they are in hard straits financially.  How are they\ngoing to secure the money to get away from town?  Goldie expresses\nit concisely:  “Well, we’re broke again (tearfully). We can’t go\nWest now, so there’s no use packing.”  This speech is like a\nsign-post that points out the condition the events have made them\nface.  And then like a sign-post that points the other way, it\nadds emphasis to the flash of the surprise and the solution when\nThe Eel, stealthily making sure no one will see him and no one can\nhear him, comes down to Goldie, sitting forlornly on the trunk,\ntaps her on the shoulder and shows her Dugan’s red wallet.  Of\ncourse, the audience knows that the wallet spells the solution of\nall their problems, but The Eel clinches it by saying, “Go right\nahead and pack.”",
        "Out of this we may draw one observation which is at least interesting,\nif not illuminating:  When an audience accepts the premises of a\nplaylet without question, it gives over many of its emotions and\nmost of its reasoning power into the author’s hands.  Therefore\nthe author must think for his audience and keenly suggest by\ndialogue that something is about to happen, show it as happening,\nand make it perfectly clear by dialogue that it has actually\nhappened.  This is the use to which dialogue is put most\ntellingly–bringing out the incidents in clear relief and at the\nvery same time interpreting them cunningly.",
        "(c) Dialogue Reveals Character Humanly.  Character is tried,\ndeveloped and changed not by dialogue, but by action; yet the first\nintimate suggestion of character is shown in dialogue; and its\ntrials, development and change are brought into clear relief–just\nas events, of which character-change is the vital part, are made\nunmistakably clear–by the often illuminating word that fits\nprecisely.  As J. Berg Esenwein says, “Just as human interest is\nthe heart of the narrative, so human speech is its most vivid\nexpression.  In everyday life we do not know a man until we have\nheard him speak.  Then our first impressions are either confirmed,\nmodified, or totally upset.” [1]",
        "[1] Writing the Short-Slory, page 247.",
        "It is by making all of his characters talk alike that the novice\nis betrayed, whereas in giving each character individuality of\nspeech as well as of action the master dramatist is revealed.\nWhile it is permissible for two minor characters to possess a hazy\nlikeness of speech, because they are so unimportant that the\naudience will not pay much attention to them, the playlet writer\nmust give peculiar individuality to every word spoken by the chief\ncharacters.  By this I do not mean that, merely to show that a\ncharacter is different, a hero or heroine should be made to talk\nwith a lisp or to use some catch-word–though this is sometimes\ndone with admirable effect.  What I mean is that the words given\nto the chief characters must possess an individuality rising from\ntheir inner differences; their speech should show them as not only\ndifferent from each other, but also different from every other\ncharacter in the playlet–in the whole world, if possible–and\ntheir words should be just the words they and no others would use\nin the circumstances.",
        "If you will remember that you must give to the dialogue of your\nchief characters a unity as complete as you must give to plot and\ncharacter as shown through action, you will evade many dialogue\ndangers.  This will not only help you to give individuality to\neach character, but also save you from making a character use\ncertain individual expressions at one time and then at another\ntalk in the way some other character has spoken.  Furthermore,\nstrict observance of this rule should keep you from putting into\nthe mouth of a grown man, who is supposed to be most manly,\nexpressions only a “sissy” would use; or introducing a character\nas a wise man and permitting him to talk like a fool.  As in life,\nso in dialogue–consistency is a test of worth.",
        "Keep your own personality out of the dialogue.  Remember that your\ncharacters and not you are doing the talking.  You have laid down\na problem in your playlet, and your audience expects it to fulfill\nits promise dramatically–that is, by a mimicry of life.  So it\ndoes not care to listen to one man inhabiting four bodies and\ntalking like a quartet of parrots.  It wants to hear four different\npersonalities talk with all the individuality that life bestows\nso lavishly–in life.",
        "You will find little difficulty in keeping your individuality out\nof dialogue if you will only remember that you cannot write\nintelligently of characters you do not know.  Make use of the\ncharacters nearest you, submerge yourself in their individualities,\nand you will then be so interested in them that you will forget\nyourself and end by making the characters of your playlet show\nthemselves in their dialogue as individual, enthrallingly entertaining,\nnew, and–what is the final test of all dialogue–convincing.",
        "(d) Dialogue Wins Laughter.  There are three sources from which\nlaughter rises out of dialogue.  First, from the word that is a\nwitticism, existing for its own sake.  Second, from the word that\nis an intensely individual expression of character–the\ncharacter-revealing phrase.  Third, the word that is funny because\nit is spoken at the right instant in the action.  All three have\na place in the playlet, but the last, the dialogue that rises out\nof and illuminates a situation, is productive of the best results.\nThis is but another way of saying what cannot be too often repeated,\nthat the playlet is plot. [1]",
        "[1] See Chapter V, in which humor was discussed in relation to the\nmonologue.",
        "Even in dialect, dialogue does not bother with anything much but\nplot-expression of character.  Indicate the odd twist of a character’s\nthoughts as clearly as you can, but never try to reproduce all his\nspeech phonetically.  If you do, you will end disastrously, for\nyour manuscript will look like a scrambled alphabet which nobody\ncan decipher.  In writing dialect merely suggest the broken English\nhere and there–follow the method so clearly shown in “The German\nSenator.”  Remember that the actor who will be engaged to play the\npart has studied the expression of that particular type all his\nlife.  His method of conveying what you intend is likely to be\ndifferent from your method.  Trust him–for you must.",
        "(e) Dialogue Advances the Action and Rounds Out the Plot.\nPrecisely in the way that incidents are brought out clearly by\ndialogue, dialogue advances the action and rounds out the plot at\nthe curtain.  Clear as I hope the method has been made, I wish to\npoint out two dialogue peculiarities which come with the rise of\nemotion.",
        "First, as the action quickens, there inevitably occurs a compression\ninherent in the dramatic that is felt by the dialogue.  Joe Maxwell’s\nepitome of vaudeville as he once expressed it to me in a most\nsuggestive discussion of the two-a-day, illustrates this point\nbetter, perhaps, than a chapter would explain:  “Vaudeville is\nmeat,” he said, “the meat of action, the meat of words.”  There\nis no time in vaudeville climaxes for one word that does not point\nout, or clinch home the action.  Here action speaks louder than\nwords.  Furthermore, in the speed of bodily movement there is\nactually no time for words.  If two men are grappling in a life\nand death struggle they can’t stop for speech.",
        "And second, as the playlet nears its ending there is no need for\nexplanatory words–if the preceding action has been dramatic.\nEvery new situation rises out of the old, the audience knows it\nall now, they even foresee the climax, and, in a well constructed\nplaylet, they feel the coming-to-an-end thrill that is in the air.\nWhat need is there for dialogue?  Only a need for the clearing,\nclinching kind, and for",
        "The Finish Line.  While the last-speech of a playlet is bone of\nthe bone and blood of the blood of plot, the finish line is\npeculiarly a part of dialogue.  It is here, in the last line, that\nthe tragic has a strangely illuminating force and the comic must\nbe given full play.  Indeed, a comedy act that does not end in a\n\"scream” is hardly worth anything.  And, as comedy acts are most\nin demand in vaudeville, I shall relate this discussion solely to\nthe comic ending.  Here it is, then, in the last line of a comedy\nact, that the whole action is rounded neatly off with a full play\nof fancy–with emphasis on the use of wit.",
        "Of course I do not mean that the last line may be permitted to\nstray away from the playlet and crack an unrelated joke.  But the\nlast line, being a completing line, may return to some incident\nearlier than the closing action.  It may with full profit even go\nback to the introduction, as “The Lollard’s” last line takes Miss\nCarey back to her interrupted sleep with, “Now, thank Gawd, I’ll\nget a little sleep.”",
        "Or it may be merely a quaint line, like that which ended a very\nsuccessful playlet which has stuck in my memory, but whose title\nI have forgotten.  Here the sweethearts were brought together,\nthey flew into each other’s arms, they kissed.  Naturally the\ncurtain was on that kiss, but no–they drew apart and the girl\nrubbed her lips with the back of her hand.  “Aw,” said the boy,\n\"what you rubbing it off for?”  And the girl, half-crying,\nhalf-laughing, answered, “I ain’t rubbing it off; I’m rubbing it\nin!“",
        "Or the last line may be a character line, rounding back to the\nopening, perhaps, but having its mainspring in character, like the\nlast line of “The Village Lawyer”:  “Well,” he sighs–as he watches\nthe money with which he could have satisfied his longing to buy a\nclarionet, disappear–\"Maybe I couldn’t play the darned thing\nanyway!” [1]",
        "[1] Chapter XV, section I.",
        "Example after example might be quoted to illustrate every possible\nvariation, yet in the end we would come to the very same conclusions\nthese four instances reveal.  The finish line is the concluding\nthought of the action.  It may round back to the opening plainly;\nbring out sharply the most prominent point developed; vividly\npresent a pleasing side-light with a punch; illuminate a character\npoint; take some completing element and twist it into a surprise–\nindeed, the finish line may present anything at all, so long as it\nthrills with human interest and laughter.",
        "In playlet dialogue there is as much need of the dramatic spirit\nas in the playlet plot.  Not what is said in real life, but what\nmust be said to express the action concisely, is its aim.  Playlet\ndialogue cannot take time to reproduce small talk.  It must connote,\nnot denote, even the big things.  To omit is more important than\nto include.  A whole life must be compressed into a single speech\nand entire stages of progression be epitomized in a single sentence.\nTrue enough, in really big scenes a character may rise to lofty\nexpression; but of all playlet moments, here sane selection and\ncompression are most vital.  The wind of talk must be made compressed\nair.",
        "Conversation for conversation’s sake is the one thing, above all\nothers that stamps a playlet as in vain.  I have seen producing\nmanager after producing manager run through manuscripts to select\nfor careful reading the ones with short speeches.  Those weighty\nwith long speeches were returned unread.  Why?  Because experience\nhad taught them that a playlet filled with long speeches is likely\nto be filled with little else.  They realize that conversation as\nan art died the day the first automobile did the mile in sixty\nflat.  Speed is what the playlet needs, and talk slows the track.\nIn the classic words of vaudeville, if you must talk, “hire a\nhall.”",
        "Where is it you hear more clever lines than anywhere else?  In\nvaudeville.  Where is it that slang hits the hardest?  In vaudeville.\nOn what stage do people talk more nearly like you and I talk?  The\nvaudeville stage.  For vaudeville is up-to-the-minute–vaudeville\nis the instant’s dramatic review.",
        "And it is this speech of the instant that playlet dialogue needs–\nthe short, sharp, seemingly thoughtless but vividly pulsating words\nof everyday life.  If today men talked in long speeches filled\nwith grandiloquent periods, the playlet would mimic their length\nand tone, but men today do not speak that way and the playlet must\nmimic today’s shortness and crispness.  As Alexander Black says,\n\"The language of the moment is the bridge; that carries us straight\nto the heart of the whole world, and all the past.  Life or fancy\nthat comes in the language of the moment comes to us translated.\nFantastically, the language of the street is always close to the\nbones of art.  It is always closer to the Bible and to all the big\nfellows than the language of the drawing rooms.  Art is only the\nexpression of ideas.  Ideas, emotions, impulses, are more important\nthan the medium, just as religion is more important than theology.\nThere is just as much excuse for saying ’theology for its own sake’\nas for saying ’art for art’s sake.’ The joy of a new word should\nmake us grateful for the fertility of the street out of which most\nof the really strong words come.  The street doesn’t make us fine,\nbut it keeps us from being too sweet and thin.  It loves the punch.\nAnd the punch clears the path.”  It is the punch in dialogue that\nthe playlet demands.",
        "Before we agree upon what is fit and becoming dialogue, I think\nit advisable to condense into a few words all that I have said on\nthe subject.  In its final analysis a playlet is a pantomime.\nDialogue is primarily employed to add emphasis to the plot.  It\ndoes this by conveying information of basic events at the opening;\nby bringing out the succeeding incidents clearly; by revealing\ncharacter humanly; by winning laughter; by advancing the action;\nand by rounding out the plot in a finish line which thrills with\nhuman interest and, in the comedy playlet, with laughter.  And\nnow, what is fit and becoming dialogue?  Fit dialogue is–what\nfits the plot exactly.  Becoming dialogue is–what makes the plot\nseem even better.  But dialogue cannot make plot better, it can\nonly make it seem better–it can only dress it.  Remember that.",
        "In considering the “business” of the playlet, we have come to the\nplace where it would seem that writing must be left behind and the\nfunction of the producer entered upon.  For business is the detail\nof stage action and movement.  But, while it is the peculiar\nfunction of the producer to invent and to incorporate into the\nplaylet little bits of everyday movements of the characters to\nlend the effect of real life to the mimic picture, it is the\nprovince of the writer–in reducing his words to the lowest possible\nnumber, in an effort to secure that “economy of attention” which\nis the foundation of all art–to tell as much of his story as he\ncan by actions that speak even louder than words.  Every great\nplaywright is as much a producer as he is a writer.",
        "As we saw in Chapter VII, “business” includes every movement an\nactor makes while he is on the stage.  Thus a facial expression\nmay be called “business,” if it lends a peculiar significance\nto a line.  And a wild leap of a man on horseback through a\nwindow–this has actually been done in a vaudeville act–is also\ncalled business.  In fact everything, from “mugging,” [1] walking\nabout, sitting down, picking up a handkerchief, taking off or\nputting on a coat, to the wordless scenes into which large parts\nof the story are condensed and made clear solely by situation–everything\nis called “business.”  But to differentiate the actor’s part from\nthe work of the playwright, I shall arbitrarily call every action\nwhich is as indivisible from acting as facial play, “pantomime\";\nwhile I shall employ the word “business” to express the use of\nmovement by the playwright for the purpose of condensing large\nparts of the story and telling it wordlessly.",
        "[1] “Mugging,” considered by some to be one of the lowest forms\nof comedy, is bidding for laughter by facial contortions unrelated\nto the action or the lines–making the scene subservient to the\ncomical faces made by the actor.",
        "[2] The impossibility of keeping separate the designing and the\nwriting of business, will be seen as the chapter progresses,\ntherefore I shall treat both freely in one.",
        "Let us turn to that part of the third scene of “The System” where\nThe Eel and Goldie–who have been given their liberty “with a\nstring to it” by Inspector McCarthy in his anxiety to catch Officer\nDugan red-handed–are “up against it” in their efforts to get away\nfrom town.  They have talked it all over in Goldie’s flat and The\nEel has gone out to borrow the money from Isaacson, the “fence.\"\nNow when The Eel closes Goldie’s door and runs downstairs, Goldie\nlistens intently until the outer door slams, then begins to\npack.  She opens the trunk first, gets her jacket from the couch\nwhere she has thrown it, puts it in the trunk and then goes up\ninto the bedroom and gets a skirt.  She shakes the skirt as she\ncomes down stage.  Then a long, low whistle is heard–then the\nrapping of a policeman’s club.",
        "“Bulls!” she gasps.  Looking up at the light burning, she turns\nit out and closes the trunk at the same time.  And she stands still\nuntil she sees the shadow of a man’s hand cast by the moonlight\non the wall.  Then she gives a frightened exclamation and cowers\non the sofa.",
        "Here we have packed into little more than sixty seconds a revelation\nof the fear in which all crooks live, the unthinking faith and\nlove Goldie bears The Eel, and a quiet moment which emphasizes the\nrush of the preceding events–a space also adding punch to the\nclimax of incidents which follow hot upon its heels.  When the\nlong, low whistle sounds and the policeman’s club raps out its\nalarm, the audience feels that the action is filled with tense\nmeaning–The Eel has been caught.  That hand on the wall is like\na coming event casting its shadow before, and when Goldie gives\nher frightened exclamation and cowers on the couch, her visible\nfear–coming in contrast to her commonplace packing to get\naway–builds up the scene into a thrill that is capped by the\nmeaningful window entrance of Dugan.  “Ah!” says the audience,\n\"here’s the first time they’ve gotten together alone.  It’s the\nfirst time we’ve really seen that Dugan is behind it all.  Something\nbig is going to happen.”",
        "All of these revealing flashes, which illumine like searchlights,\nare told by movement.  The only word that is spoken is Goldie’s\ncry “Bulls!”  The only other sounds are the whistle and the rapping\nof the club.  But if Goldie had taken up the time with telling the\naudience how glad she was to pack and get away with The Eel to a\nnew life, and if she had expressed her fear by bewailing the\nhardness of fate–the dramatic effect would have been lost.  Do\nyou see how words can kill and soundless movements vivify?",
        "In “The Lollard,” when Miss Carey wants to disillusionize Angela,\nshe does not sit down and argue her out of her insane infatuation\nfor Fred; nor does she tell Angela that Fred is a “lollard” and\nweakly unmask him by describing his “lollard “ points.  She cries\n\"Fire!  Fire!  Fire!”  Whereupon Fred dashes out on the stage and\nAngela and the audience with their own eyes behold Fred as a\n\"lollard.”  Here the whole problem of the playlet is solved in a\nflash.  Not one word of explanatory dialogue is needed.",
        "In “Three of a Kind,” a comedy playlet produced by Roland West,\ntwo crooks fleece a “sucker” and agree to leave the money in a\nmiddle room while they sleep in opposite rooms.  They say they\ntrust each other implicitly, but each finds a pretext to sit up\nand watch that money himself.  The comedy rises from their movements\naround the room as they try to outmaneuver each other.",
        "These three examples plainly show how movement, unexplained by\ndialogue, may be used to condense a middle action, a climax, and\nan opening.  Now, if you will turn to the surprise ending of “The\nSystem\"–which has been discussed before in its relation to\ndialogue–you will see how business may condense an ending.  Indeed,\nthe very essence of the surprise ending lies in this dramatic\nprinciple.  Of course, how the condensation of story into movement\nis to be made in any given case depends upon the material, and the\nwriter’s purpose.  But as a part of the problem let us see",
        "Consider the inimitable gesture the Latins use when they wish to\nexpress their helplessness.  The shoulders shrug until the man\nseems folding into himself, his hands come together approaching\nhis face and then he drops them despairingly to his side as if he\nwould say:  “But what can I do?”  A gesture such as this reveals\nin a flash the depths of a human soul.  Volumes could say no more.",
        "This is what the actor may bring to your playlet, and what you,\nwith the greatest caution, may sometimes–though rarely–indicate\nin your manuscript.",
        "“Walk up stage,” said David Belasco to an actor who was proving\n\"difficult,” “and when you turn your back, get some meaning into\nit.  Make your back express–the whole play, if you can.”  Most\ncertainly you would not write this in the directions for a\nplaylet–the producer would laugh at it and the actor would be\nindignant.  But you might with the greatest helpfulness direct\nthat the character turn his back–and this is the point of the\nproblem–if, by turning his back on some one, the character conveys,\nsay, contempt for or fearlessness of an enemy’s bravado.  Every\ndirection for acting in your playlet must be of such a kind that\nanyone can convey the meaning–because the emphasis is inherent\nin the situation.  A stage direction ought not to depend for its\nvalue on the actor’s ability.  If this were not so, play writing\nwould consist chiefly in engaging fine actors.",
        "When an actor receives a part he studies it not only to learn the\nlines, but with the desire to familiarize himself with the character\nso thoroughly that he may not seem to be playing it.  He hopes to\nmake the audience feel that the character is alive.  For this\nreason, it is not amiss to indicate characteristic actions once\nin a while.  A good example of this is found in “The Lollard,\"\nwhere Angela says to Miss Carey:  “But–excuse me–how do you know\nso many different kinds of men if you’ve never been married?”",
        "“Boarders,” says Miss Carey quickly.  “To make ends meet, I’ve\nalways had to have a male boarder since I was left an orphan.\"\n\"She rises–turns her back to audience–gives a touch to her\npigtail, during laugh on this line.  This business always builds\nlaugh,” say the directions.  It is such little touches that stamp\na character as individual; and therefore they are just the little\ntouches the playwright may add to his manuscript by way of suggestion\nto the actor.  They may be very helpful, indeed, but they should\nbe made with great care and discretion.  For the actor, if he is\na capable performer, is ready when rehearsal begins with many\nsuggestions of a like nature.  He will often suggest something\nthat will not only exhibit character clearly, but will also condense\nstory by eliminating needless words and movement.",
        "For instance:  F. F. Mackay was rehearsing to play the French count\nin the famous old play, “One of Our Girls.”  Mr. Bronson Howard\nhad directed in his manuscript that the count, when struck across\nthe face with a glove by an English officer, should become very\nviolent and angry, in accordance with the popular notion of an\nexcitable Frenchman’s character.  “But Mr. Mackay,” says Daniel\nFrohman, “argued that the French count, having been shown in the\nplay to be an expert duellist with both the rapier and the pistol,\nand having faced danger frequently, was not liable to lose control\nof himself.  Mr. Howard readily saw the point.  The result was one\nof the most striking situations in the American drama; for the\nFrenchman received the insult without the movement of a muscle.\nHe stood rigid.  Only the flash of the eye for an instant revealed\nhis emotion.  Then the audience saw his face grow red, and then\npale.  This was followed by the quiet announcement from the count\nthat he would send his seconds to see the Englishman.",
        "“This exhibition of facial emotion betrayed by the visible rush\nof blood to the actor’s face was frequently noted at the time.\nIt was a muscular trick, Mr. Mackay told me.  He put on a tight\ncollar for the scene and strained his neck against it until the\nblood tame, and when he released the pressure, and the blood\nreceded, the effect was reached.  It was a splendid moment, and\nit is one of the many effects that have been studied out during\nthe progress and development of a play during rehearsals.”",
        "It is for the great majority of such little touches, therefore,\nthat the playwright must depend on the actor and the producer to\nadd to his playlet.  However, the playwright may help to the limit\nof his ability, by giving very short, very carefully thought out\ndirections in his manuscript.  But it is much better for the novice\nto disregard suggestions to the actor for character analysis and\neven to be sparing with his hints for facial expressions or slight\nmovements–and to content himself with an effort to condense his\nstory in the broader ways.",
        "As the playlet is primarily action, and as the audience expects\nthe playlet to keep moving all the time, it is a common practise\nto try to trick the audience into believing every speech is vibrant\nwith emotional force, by keeping the actors moving about the stage.\nBut the fact that a really vital speech may be killed by a movement\nwhich distracts the attention of the audience ought to be proof\npositive that needless movements about the stage are merely a\nconfession of poverty in the playlet.  Nevertheless, as a long\nexplanatory speech seems sometimes unavoidable, I devote two or\nthree short paragraphs to what has saved some playlets from absolute\nfailure.",
        "If you are unable to tell every bit of your story by dramatic means\nand therefore face a long speech that may seem tiresomely wordy,\nbreak it up with natural movements which lend a feeling of homely\nreality to the scene.  For instance, don’t let the character who\nis delivering that long speech tell it all uninterruptedly from\nthe chair in which he is sitting.  Let him rise after he has spoken\ntwo or three sentences and cross to the other character, or do\nsomething that will illustrate a point in his story, or have the\none who is listening interrupt now and then.  Inject motive into\nthe interruptions if you can; but in any event, keep your characters\nmoving.",
        "But make the movements natural.  To this end, study the movements\nof the men and women about you.  Try to invent new ways of expressing\nthe old things in movement.  Strive not so much to be “different,\"\nas to be vividly interesting.  You can make the movements of your\ncharacters about the stage as brilliant as dialogue.",
        "Above all, make sure that you do not let your characters wander\nabout the stage aimlessly.  To make it a complete unity every\nlittle scene demands as careful thought as does the entire playlet.\nA playlet may be suggestively defined as a number of minute-long\nplaylets moving vividly one after the other to make a vivid whole.\nRemember this, and you may be able to save a tiresome scene from\nruining the entire effect of your playlet.",
        "As a playlet is nothing if it is not action, so a comedy playlet\nis nothing if its comedy does not develop from situations.  By\n\"action,” as the word is used here, I mean that the story of the\nplaylet is told by the movements of its characters.  In real life,\nyou know, comedy and tragedy do not come from what persons say\nthey are going to do–but from what they actually do.  Therefore,\nthe merry jests that one character perpetrates upon another must\nbe told not in words, but by showing the character actually\nperpetrating them on the victim.  In a comedy playlet, the playwright\nmust be a practical joker.  Every funny happening in a playlet is\na “scene that must be shown.”",
        "For instance, in “Billy’s Tombstones,” the football player who is\nin love with the girl, whom he has followed half around the world,\nis shown first as losing his “tombstones\"–his false teeth, made\nnecessary by the loss of his real ones in a famous college game;\nthen he is shown in his wild efforts to pronounce his sweetheart’s\nname without the dental help.  Much of the comedy arises from his\nefforts to pronounce that loved name–and the climax comes when\nthe lost tombstones are found and Billy proposes to her in perfect\nspeech that lingers fondly on her name.",
        "In farce–particularly in the old farces which depended on mistaken\nidentity, a motive force considered hardly worthy of use today–the\ncomedy arises very rarely from a witty saying in itself.  The fun\nusually depends upon the humorous situations that develop.  “The\nNew Coachman\"–one of those old farcical “screams\"–contained an\nexceptionally fine example of this point and is pertinent to-day\nbecause it had no relation to mistaken identity in this humorous\nscene.  Here the best fun of the comedy came from the use of a\nstepladder by the supposed coachman, who got all tangled up in it.\nAfter the first misstep with that stepladder, there was never any\ntime for more than a word here and there.  Of course, such a scene\ndepends upon the actor almost entirely, and therefore cannot be\nindicated in the business by the playwright, but I use it for an\nexample because it is a peculiarly brilliant instance of the fact\nthat hearty laughter depends not on hearing, but on seeing.",
        "But do not make the mistake of trying to patch together a comedy\nplaylet from the bits of funny stage business you have seen in\nother acts.  If you present such a manuscript to a producer you\nmay be very sure it will be refused, for there are plenty of\nproducers and performers in vaudeville who can supply such an act\nat a moment’s notice from memory.",
        "The sort of comedy expected from the playwright is comedy that\ndevelops from situation.  It is in the invention of new situations\nand new business to fit these situations that the playlet writer\nfinds his reward in production and profit.",
        "Among the many definitions of drama–frequently misleading, but\nequally often helpful–there is one which holds the whole art of\nplay writing lies in getting the characters on the stage naturally\nand effectively and getting them off again–naturally and effectively.\nBut, even the most daring of definition makers has not yet told\nus how this is to be accomplished in all cases.  The fact is, no\none can tell us, because a method that would be natural and effective\nin a given playlet, would very likely be most unnatural and\nineffective in another.  All that can be said is that the same\ndramatic sense with which you have constructed the story of your\nplaylet will carry you forward in the inevitable entrances and\nexits.  How these moments are to be effective, lies in the very\nnature of the story you are telling.  This is boldly begging the\nquestion, but it is all that may with honest helpfulness be said.",
        "However, regarding the stage-cross, and allied movements of the\nactors, there are two suggestions that may be helpful.  The first\nis founded on the old theory that a scene ought to be “dressed\"\nall the time–that is, if one character moves across the stage,\nthe other ought to move a little up stage to give him room to cross\nand should then move down on the opposite side, to keep the scene\ndressed or “balanced.”  But no hard and fast rule can be given,\neven for the stage-cross.  If it seems the easy and natural thing\nfor the characters to do this, all well and good.  But you should\nfeel no compulsion about it and really should give to the matter\nbut little thought.",
        "The second is based on the common-sense understanding at which you\nyourself will arrive if you will take the trouble to notice how\nthe slightest movement made by one of two persons to whom you are\ntelling a story distracts the other’s attention.  Briefly, never\nindicate business for a character during the moments when short\nand vitally important speeches are conveying information to the\naudience.",
        "Both of these minor suggestions may be summed up in this sentence\nwith which I shall dismiss the subject:  The box sets in which the\nplaylet is played in vaudeville are usually not very deep and are\nso arranged that every part of the scene is in plain view from\npractically every seat in the house, therefore you may forget that\nyour story is being played in a mimic room and may make your\ncharacters move as if the room were real.  If you will only keep\nin mind you should have little trouble.",
        "In the old days before the boxed set, the manuscript of a play\nbristled with such cryptic signs as R. U. E., and L. F. E., meaning,\nwhen reduced to everyday English, “right upper entrance,” “left\nfirst entrance,” and the like.  But as the old “entrances” of the\nstage have been lost with the introduction of the box set, which\nclosely mimics a real room–being, indeed, a room with the fourth\nwall removed–the modern stage directions are much simpler.  “Right\ndoor,” “centre door,” “left door,” are the natural directions to\nbe found in a playlet manuscript today.",
        "It is a good general rule to avoid in your stage directions\nexpressions which show you are dealing with a stage scene and not\na scene of real life.  In the first place, if you attempt to be\ntechnical, you are very likely to be over-technical and confusing.\nIn the second place, you will be more likely to produce a life-like\nplaylet if you are not forever groping among strange terms, which\nmake you conscious all the time that you are dealing with unreality.\nTherefore choose the simplest directions, expressed in the fewest\npossible words, to indicate the effects you have carefully thought\nout:  Never forget that reality and simplicity go hand in hand.",
        "And now it may be of advantage to sum up what has been said about\nstage business in this chapter.  We have seen how business may be\nused to condense the story of a playlet; how business is often–though\nnot always–the very heart of the dramatic; how pantomime may be\nskillfully used to condense salient parts of the playlet story and\nillumine character; how business may be employed to break up a\nclumsy but necessarily long speech–thus sometimes saving a playlet\nfrom the failure of the tedious;–and why business is more productive\nof comedy than is dialogue.  We have concluded that the playlet\nwriter must not ape what has already been done, but can win success\nonly in the measure he succeeds in bringing to his playlet new\nbusiness which makes his new situations all the more vivid and\nvital.  Finally, we have seen that entrances and exits must be\nnatural and effective, and that all stage business should be\nconceived and thought of and indicated in the manuscript as simple\nexpressions of reality.",
        "With this chapter, the six elements of a successful playlet have\nbeen discussed from the angle of exposition.  In the next chapter\nI shall make use of all this expository material and shall endeavor\nto show how playlets are actually written.",
        "While it is plain that no two writers ever have, nor ever will,\ngo about writing a playlet in precisely the same way, and impossible\nas it is to lay down rules which may be followed with precision\nto inevitable success, I shall present some suggestions, following\nthe logical order of composition.",
        "First, however, I must point out that you should study the vaudeville\nstage of this week, not of last year or even of last month, before\nyou even entertain a germ idea for a playlet.  You should be sure\nbefore you begin even to think out your playlet, that its problem\nis in full accord with the very best, and that it will fit into\nvaudeville’s momentary design with a completeness that will win\nfor it an eager welcome.",
        "You should inquire of yourself first, “Is this a comedy or a serious\nplaylet I am about to write?”  And if the latter, “Should I write\na serious playlet?”",
        "One of vaudeville’s keenest observers, Sime Silverman, editor of\nVariety, said when we were discussing this point:  “Nobody ought\nto write a tragic or even a serious playlet who can write anything\nelse.  There are two or three reasons why.  First, vaudeville likes\nlaughter, and while it may be made to like tears, a teary playlet\nmust be exceedingly well done to win.  Second, the serious playlet\nmust be so well done and so well advertised that usually a big\nname is necessary to carry it to success; and the ’name’ demands\nso much money that it is sometimes impossible to engage an adequate\nsupporting cast.  Third, the market for tragic and serious playlets\nis so small that there is only opportunity for the playlet master;\nof course, there sometimes comes an unknown with a great success,\nlike ’War Brides,’ [1] but only rarely.  Therefore, I would advise\nthe new writer to write comedy.”",

        "Miss Nellie Revell, whom B. F. Keith once called “The Big Sister\nof Vaudeville,” and who was Vaudeville Editor of the New York\nMorning Telegraph before becoming General Press Representative of\nthe Orpheum Circuit, summed up her years of experience as a critic\nin these words:",
        "“The new writer should first try his hand at a comedy playlet.\nThen after he has made a success of comedy, or if he is sure he\ncan’t write anything but sobby playlets, let him try to make an\naudience weep.  Vaudeville, like any other really human thing,\nwould rather laugh than cry, yet if you make vaudeville cry finely,\nit will still love you.  But a serious playlet must be mighty well\ndone to get over–therein lies a stumbling block sometimes.  A few\ngreat artists can make vaudeville sob finely–but only a few.\nComedy, good comedy, always gets by.",
        "“How many comedy playlets are there to one serious playlet in\nvaudeville?  I should say about ten to one.  That ought to convince\nanybody that comedy is the thing to write for vaudeville.”",
        "There have been many hybrid playlets which have combined tragedy\nand comedy to give some particular star an opportunity to show\nversatility in acting. [1] But some of these playlets have been\nmerely vehicles for a personality, and therefore cannot be considered\nin this discussion.",
        "[1] See Chapter XII, section II, topic 2.",
        "On the other hand, there have been some serious playlets which\nhave had comedy twists, or a light turn, which brought the curtain\ndown amid laughter that was perfectly logical and in good taste.\nAn example of the surprise ending that lightens the gloom is found\nin “The Bomb,” finely played by Wilton Lackaye, in which the Italian\nwho so movingly confesses to the outrage is merely a detective in\ndisguise, trapping the real bomb thrower–and suddenly he unmasks.\nIf a serious playlet can be made to end with a light touch that\nis fitting, it will have a better chance in vaudeville.  But this\nis one of the most difficult and dangerous effects to attempt.\nThe hazard is so great that success may come but once in many\nefforts. [2]",
        "[2] See Chapter XIV, section II, topic 3.",
        "Since comedy should be the new writer’s aim, the following discussion,\nwhile conceived with the broad view to illustrate the writing of\nthe playlet in general, brings into particular prominence the\nwriting of comedy.",
        "When should you begin to write your playlet?  Assuming that you\nalready have a germ idea, the next step is to express your theme\nin a single short sentence, and consider it as your playlet problem,\nwhich must be proved logically, clearly and conclusively.  To do\nthis you must dovetail your incidents into a playlet plot; but how\nfar should you think out your playlet before beginning to set it\ndown on paper?",
        "Nearly all the playlet writers with whom I have talked during a\nperiod of more than five years have with surprising unanimity\ndeclared in favor of beginning with the scenario, the summary of\nthe dramatic action.  But they disagree as to the completeness\nwith which the scenario should be drawn up.",
        "Some merely sketch the main outlines of the plot and leave to the\nmoment of actual writing the details that often make it a success.\nOthers write out a long scenario, boiling it down to the essence\nfor the stage version.  Still other playlet writers carry their\nscenarios just far enough to make sure that they will not have to\nthink about the details of plot when they set about writing the\ndialogue–they see that there is an effective reason for the\nentrance of each character and a clear motive for exit.  But,\nhowever they disagree as to the completeness the scenario should\nshow, they all agree that the plot should be firmly fixed in its\ngeneral outlines before pen is set to paper.",
        "It may be of suggestive value as well as of interest to point out\nthat in olden times the scenario was the only part of the play the\nplaywright wrote.  The groundwork of the plot was fixed beyond\nchange, and then the actors were permitted to do as they pleased\nwithin these limits.  Even today, in the construction of hurried\nentertainments for club nights at the various actors’ club-houses,\noften only the scenario or general framework of the act is typewritten\nand handed to the performers who are to take part.  All that this\ntells them is that on some given cue they are to enter and work\nopposite so-and-so, and are, in turn, to give an agreed-upon cue\nto bring on such-and-such a performer.  In a word, the invaluable\npart of any dramatic entertainment is the scenario.",
        "One valuable aid to the making of a clear and effective scenario\nis the use of a diagram of the set in which the act is to be played.\nReference to Chapter IV, “The Scenery Commonly Found in Vaudeville\nTheatres,” will place in your hands a wide–if not an exhaustive–\nrange of variations of the commonly found box sets.  Within the walls\nof any one of these diagrams you may carefully mark the exact\nlocation of chairs, tables and any other properties your action\ndemands.  Then, knowing the precise room in which your characters\nmust work, you can plot the details of their movements exactly\nfrom entrances to exits and give to your playlet action a clearness\nand preciseness it might not otherwise possess.",
        "But there is one point I feel the necessity of emphasizing, whose\napplication each one must determine for himself:  While you ought\nto consider your scenario as directive and as laying down the line\nthat should be followed, you ought not to permit your playlet to\nbecome irrevocably fixed merely because you have written your\nscenario.  It is often the sign of a dramatic mind, and of a healthy\nproblem too, that the playlet changes and develops as the theme\nis carefully considered.  To produce the very best work, a scenario\nmust be thought of as clay to be molded, rather than as iron that\nmust be scrapped and melted again to be recast.",
        "This section is so arranged that the elements of writing discussed\nin the preceding chapters are summarized, and the vital elements\nwhich could not be considered before are all given their proper\nplaces in a step-by-step scheme of composition.  The whole forms\na condensed standard for review to refresh your memory before\nwriting, and by which to test your playlet after it is written.",
        "Every playlet must have a beginning, a middle and an ending.  The\nbeginning must state the premises of the problem clearly and simply;\nthe middle must develop the problem logically and solve the\nentanglement in a “big” scene, and the ending must round out the\nwhole satisfyingly–with a surprise, if fitting.",
        "Because the total effect of a playlet is complete oneness, there\nlie in the “big” scene and in the ending certain results of which\nthe beginning must be the beginning or immediate cause.  Such\ncauses are what you must show clearly.",
        "(a) The Causes before the Curtain Rose.  If the causes lie far\nback in events that occurred before the curtain rose, you must\nhave those events carefully and clearly stated.  But while you\nconvey this necessary exposition as dramatically as possible, be\nsure to make the involved dramatic elements subservient to clearness.",
        "(b) The Causes that Occur after the Curtain Rises.  If the causes\ndo not lie in the past, but occur after the curtain rises, you\nmust show them as clearly occurring right then and there.  They\nmust be as plain as dawn, or the rest of the playlet will be\nshrouded in the darkness of perplexing doubts.",
        "(c) The Character Motive from which the Complication Rises.  If\nthe causes lie in character, you must show the motive of the person\nof the playlet from whose peculiar character the complication rises\nlike a spring from its source.  You must expose the point of\ncharacter plainly.",
        "But in striving to make your premises clear do not make the mistake\nof being prolix–or you will be tedious.  Define character sharply.\nTell in quick, searching dialogue the facts that must be told and\nlet your opening scenes on which the following events depend, come\nwith a snap and a perfectly adequate but nevertheless, have-done-with-it\nfeeling.",
        "In every scene of your playlet you must prepare the minds of your\naudience to accept gladly what follows–and to look forward to it\neagerly.  You must not only plainly show what the causes of every\naction are, but you must also make the audience feel what they\nimply.  Thus you will create the illusion which is the chief\ncharm of the theatre–a feeling of superiority to the mimic\ncharacters which the gods must experience as they look down upon\nus.  This is the inalienable right of an audience.",
        "(a) The Scenes that Make Suspense.  But while foreshadowing\nplainly, you must not forestall your effect.  One of the most\nimportant elements of playlet writing is to let your audience guess\nwhat is going to happen–but keep them tensely interested in how\nit is going to happen.  This is what creates the playlet’s enthralling\npower–suspense.",
        "It is so important to secure suspense in a playlet that an experienced\nwriter who feels that he has not created it out of the body of his\nmaterial, will go back to the beginning and insert some point that\nwill pique the curiosity of the audience, leaving it unexplained\nuntil the end.  He keeps the audience guessing, but he satisfies\ntheir curiosity finely in the finish–this is the obligation such\na suspense element carries with it.",
        "(b) The Points that Balance the Preparation with the Result.\nNothing could be more disastrous than to promise with weighty\npreparation some event stupendously big with meaning and then to\noffer a weak little result.  And it would be nearly as unfortunate\nto foreshadow a weak little fulfillment and then to present a\ntremendous result.  Therefore, you must so order your events that\nyou balance the preparation with the result, to the shade of a\ndramatic hair.",
        "But take care to avoid a too obvious preparation.  If you disclose\ntoo plainly what you are aiming at your end is defeated in advance,\nbecause your audience is bound to lapse into a cynically smiling\ndoes-this-fellow-take-us-for-babies? attitude.",
        "The art of the dramatic is the art that conceals art.  The middle\nof your playlet must conceal just enough to keep the stream of\nsuspense flowing eagerly toward the end, which is dimly seen to\nbe inevitably approaching.",
        "(c) The One Event that Makes the Climax Really Big.  From the\nfirst speech, through every speech, and in every action, your\nplaylet has moved toward this one event, and now you must bring\nit out so prominently that everything else sinks into insignificance.\nThis event is:  The change in the relations of the characters.",
        "This is the planned-for result of all that has gone before.  Bear\nfirmly in mind that you have built up a suspense which this change\nmust crown.  Keep foremost the fact that what you have hidden\nbefore you must now disclose.  Lay your cards on the table face\nup–all except one.  This last card takes the final trick, completing\nthe hand you have laid down, and everyone watches with breathless\ninterest while you play:",
        "If you can make this final event a surprise, all the better.  But\nif you cannot change the whole result in one dramatic disclosure,\nyou must be content to lay down your last card, not as a point in\nitself surprising, but nevertheless dramatically.",
        "The Finish must be Complete–and Completely Satisfy.  You have\nsprung your climax; you have disclosed what it is that changes the\nrelations of your characters; now you must show that those relations\nhave been changed.  And at the same time you bring forward the\nlast strand of plot that is loose and weave it into the now complete\ndesign.  You must account for everything here in the finish, and\ndo it with speed.",
        "Now let us say that you have expanded the first draft of your\nplastic scenario into a nearly perfect manuscript.  But as you\nread it over, you are not content.  You feel that it lacks “punch.\"\nWhat is “punch,” and how are you going to add it when it is lacking?",
        "Willard Mack says:  “’Punch’ is the most abused word I know.  The\ndramatic punch is continually confused with the theatrical trick.\nCritics said the third act of ’Kick In’ [1]–in which the detective\nis overpowered in a hand-to-hand fight after a hypodermic has been\njabbed into his wrist–had a punch.  It didn’t. What it really had\nwas a theatric trick.  But the human punch was in the second act,\nwhen the little frightened girl of the slums comes to see her\nwounded lover–who is really dead.  If the needle should suddenly\nbe lost in playing the third act the scene would be destroyed.\nBut the other moment would have its appeal regardless of theatrical\ndetail.”",
        "[1] Developed into a long play from the vaudeville act of the same\nname.",
        "Punch comes only from a certain strong human appeal in the story.\nPunch is the thing that makes the pulse beat a little quicker,\nbecause the heart has been touched.  Punch is the precise moment\nof the dramatic.  It is the second in which the revelation flashes\nupon the audience.",
        "While whatever punch you may be able to add must lie in the heart\nof your material–which no one but yourself can know–there are\nthree or four ways by which you may go about finding a mislaid\npunch.",
        "If you have turned the logical order of writing about and let your\nplaylet drag you instead of your driving it, you may find help in\nasking yourself whether you should keep your secret from the\naudience.",
        "While it is possible to write a most enthralling novel of mystery\nor a detective short-story which suddenly, at the very last moment,\nmay disclose the trick by which it has all been built up, such a\nthing is not successfully possible in a playlet.  You must not\nconceal the identity of anyone of your characters from the audience.\nConceal his identity from every other character and you may construct\na fine playlet, but don’t conceal his motive from the audience.",
        "The very nature of the drama–depending as it does on giving to\nthe spectator the pleasure of feeling omniscient–precludes the\npossibility of “unheralded surprise.”  For instance, if you have\na character whom the audience has never seen before and of whom\nthey know nothing suddenly spring up from behind a sofa where he\nhas overheard two other characters conspiring–the audience may\nthink he is a stage-hand.  How would they know he was connected\nwith the other characters in the playlet if you neglected to tell\nthem beforehand?  They could not know.  The sudden appearance of\nthe unknown man from behind the sofa would have much the effect\nof a disturbance in the rear of the theatre, distracting attention\nfrom the characters on the stage and the plot of the playlet.",
        "If your plot calls for an eavesdropper behind a sofa–though I\nhope you will never resort to so ancient a device–you must first\nlet the audience know who he is and why he wants to eavesdrop; and\nsecond you must show him going behind that sofa.  The audience\nmust be given the god-like pleasure of watching the other two\ncharacters approach the sofa and sit down on it, in ignorance that\nthere is an enemy behind it into whose hands they are delivering\nthemselves.",
        "This is only a simple instance, but it points out how far the\nramifications to which this problem of not keeping a secret from\nthe audience may extend.  Moreover, it should suggest that it is\npossible that your playlet lacks the required punch–because you\nhave kept something secret that you ought to have disclosed.\nTherefore, go through your playlet carefully and try to discover\njust what you have not treated with dramatic frankness.",
        "On the other hand, of course, if you decide you must keep a\nsecret–some big mystery of plot–you must be sure that it is worth\nkeeping.  If you build up a series of mysterious incidents, the\nsolution must be adequate to the suspense.  But, I have treated\nthis angle of secret-keeping in “preparation versus result,” so I\nshall now direct your attention to the other side of the problem\nof dramatic frankness–which may be the cause of the lack of punch:",
        "Go back through the early moments of your playlet and see if you\nhave not given the whole thing away at the very beginning.  If you\nhave, you have, as we saw, killed your suspense, which is the road\non which punch lies in wait.  The way to remedy this defect is to\ncondense the preparation and so express it in action and by dialogue\nthat you leave opportunity for a revealing flash.",
        "In going over your manuscript you must strive to attain the correct\nbalance between the two.  The whole art lies in knowing just what\nto disclose and it when to disclose it–and what not and when not\nto disclose.",
        "Remember that vaudeville has no time for “fine speeches.”  Cut\neven the lines you have put in for the purpose of disclosing\ncharacter, and–save in rare instances–depend chiefly on character\nrevelation through action.",
        "One of the most common reasons why playlets lack the effect of\nvital oneness is to be found in the fault of mixing the kinds:\nfor example, making the first half a comedy and the second half\na tragedy.  It is as if a song began with one air and suddenly\nswitched to a totally different melody.  If your playlet is a\ncomedy, make it a comedy throughout; it if is a deeply human story,\nlet it end as it began; [1] if you are writing a straight drama\nor a melodrama, keep your playlet straight drama or melodrama all\nthe way through.  Go over your playlet with the eye of a relentless\ncritic and make sure that you have not mixed your genres, which\nonly in the rarest cases can be done effectively.",
        "[1] See Chapter XIV, section II, topic 3.",
        "Finally, if every other investigation has failed to develop the\nneeded punch, go over your playlet again to see if it is possible\nthat you have erred in the first principle of the art.  If you\nhave permitted even one tiny scene to creep in that does not hold\na vital meaning to the single point of your climax, you have lost\nby so much the possibility of the punch.  Remember, here, that a\ngreat playlet can be played without a single word being spoken and\nstill be vividly clear to everyone.  Realizing this, chop every\nsecond of action that is not vital.",
        "But long before you have exhausted these suggestions you will have\ndeveloped your punch.  Your punch has risen out of your material–\nif you possess the sense of the dramatic.  If the punch has not\ndeveloped–with a series of minor punches that all contribute to\nthe main design of the “heart wallop\"–there is something wrong\nwith your material.",
        "But even a realization of this ought not to discourage you, for\nthere are instances every day of well-known playwrights who have\nchosen the wrong material.  We all have seen these plays.  You\nmust do as they do–cast your playlet aside and begin anew with\nnew material.  The man who keeps at it is the only one who wins–but\nhe must keep at it with the right stuff.",
        "When you have trimmed your playlet by cutting off all the trimmings,\nyour thoughts naturally turn to a title.  More than likely you\nhave selected your title long before you have written “curtain\"–it\nis possible a title sprang into your mind out of the germ idea.\nBut even then, you ought now to select the proper title.",
        "A proper title is one that both names a playlet and concisely\nsuggests more than it tells.  For instance, “The System” suggests\na problem vital to all big cities–because the word “system” was on\neverybody’s tongue at the time.  “The Lollard” piques curiosity–what\nis a “lollard,” you are inclined to want to know; it also carries\na suggestion of whimsicality.  “The Villain Still Pursued Her,\"\ntells as plainly as a whole paragraph could that the playlet is a\ntravesty, making fun of the old blood-and-thunder melodrama.  “In\nand Out” is a short, snappy, curiosity-piquing name; it is a title\nthat hangs out a sign like a question mark.  “Kick In” is of the\nsame class, but with the added touch of slang.  “War Brides” is\nanother luring title, and one that attracts on frankly dramatic\nand “problem” grounds.  “Youth” is a title that suggests much more\nthan it tells–it connotes almost anything.  “Blackmail” has the\npunch of drama and suggests “atmosphere” as well.  But these are\nenough to establish the fact that a good title is one which suggests\nmore than it tells.  A good title frankly advertises the wares\nwithin, yet wakens eager curiosity to see what those wares are.",
        "An improper title, first, is one that does not precisely fit a\nplaylet as a name; or second, that tells too much.  For instance,\n\"Sweets to the Sweet” is the title of a playlet whose only reason\nfor being so named is because the young man brings the girl a box\nof candy–it does not name the playlet at all precisely, its\nconnotation is misleading.  Do not choose a title just because it\nis pretty.  Make your title really express the personality of your\nplaylet.  But more important still, do not let your title tell too\nmuch.  If “The Bomb” were called “The Trap,” much of the effect\nof the surprise would be discounted, and the unmasking of the\ndetective who confesses to throwing the bomb to trap the real\ncriminal would come as something expected.  In a word, be most\ncareful not to select a title that “gives it all away.”",
        "A short title seems to be the playlet fashion today; but tomorrow\nthe two- or three-word title may grow to a four- or five-word name.\nYet it will never be amiss to make a title short.",
        "This same law of good use points to a similar variation in the\ncontext of even the short title–I mean that every little while\nthere develops a fad for certain words.  There may at any time\nspring up a wide use of words like “girl,” or “fun,” or color\nwords, like “red “ or “purple” or “blond.”  But your close study\nof the vaudeville of the moment will show you when these fad-words\nmay be used advantageously in a title.",
        "You need never worry over-long about a title for your playlet if\nyou put the emphasis in your own mind upon the fact that your title\nis an advertisement.",
        "But when you have a playlet manuscript that is full of laughter\nand vibrant with dramatic thrills, and even after you have sold\nit to a manager who has produced it, your work as a playlet writer\nis not done.  You still must cut and polish it until it is a\nflawless gem that flashes from the stage.  As Edgar Allan Woolf\nexpressed it to me in one of our conversations:",
        "“The work of the author of a one-act comedy is not over until,\nafter several weeks of playing, his playlet has been so reshaped\nand altered by him that not a single dull spot remains.  Individual\nlines must be condensed so that they are as short as they possibly\ncan be made.  The elimination of every unnecessary word or phrase\nis essential.  Where a line that develops the plot can be altered\nso that it will still serve its purpose, and also score a laugh\non its own account, it must be so changed.  Where lines cannot be\nchanged, bits of comedy business may perhaps be inserted to keep\nthe audience from lapsing into listlessness.  For it is a deplorable\nfact that a vaudeville audience that is not laughing outright at\na comedy becomes listless.  Vaudeville managers never book a playlet\nthat makes an audience smile–for while the humor that brings a\nsmile may be more brilliant than the comedy that gets a laugh, it\nmust always be remembered that vaudeville audiences come to laugh\nand not to smile.  Some of the biggest laughs in every one of my\nmany acts I put in after the acts had been playing some weeks.\nAnd I attribute whatever success they have had later in the best\nvaudeville theatres to the improvements I have made during their\n’breaking in’ periods.”",
        "To sum up:  While no two writers ever have written and never will\nwrite a playlet in precisely the same way, the wise beginner chooses\nfor his first playlet a comedy theme.  Your germ idea you express\nin a single short sentence which you consider as the problem of\nyour playlet, to be solved logically, clearly and conclusively.\nInstinct for the dramatic leads you to lift out from life’s flowing\nstream of events the separate incidents you require and to dovetail\nthem into a plot which tells the story simply by means of characters\nand dialogue skillfully blended into an indivisible whole, flashing\nwith revealing meaning and ending with complete satisfaction.",
        "After you have thought out your playlet, you set down so much of\nit as you feel is necessary in the form of a scenario.  But you\ndo not consider this scenario as unchangeable.  Rather you judge\nthe value of the idea by the freedom with which it grows in\neffectiveness.  And while this process is going on, you carefully\nselect the basic points in the beginning of the story that must\nbe brought out prominently.",
        "Then you develop the story by making the points that foreshadow\nyour “big” scene stand out so as to weave the enthralling power\nof suspense.  You let your audience guess what is going to happen,\nbut keep them tensely interested in how it is going to happen.\nAnd you prepare your audience by a carefully preserved balance\nbetween the promise and the performance for the one big point of\nthe climax which changes the relations of the characters to each\nother.",
        "After you have shown the change as happening, you punch home the\nfact that it has happened, and withhold your completing card until\nthe finish.  In your finish you play the final card and account\nfor the last loose strand of the plot, with a speed that does not\ndetract from your effect of complete satisfaction.",
        "In seeking to “punch up” your playlet, you go over every word,\nevery bit of characterization, every moment of action, and eliminate\nsingle words, whole speeches, entire scenes, to cut down the playlet\nto the meat, seeking for lost punches particularly in the faults\nof keeping secrets that should be instantly disclosed, and in the\ntoo frank disclosures of secrets that ought to be kept in the\nbeginning.  And out of this re-writing there rises into view the\n\"heart wallop” which first attracted you.",
        "Finally, when your playlet is finished, you decide on a proper\ntitle.  Remembering that a title is an advertisement, you choose\na short name that both names and lures.  And then you prepare\nthe manuscript for its market–which is discussed in a later\nchapter.",
        "But when you have written your playlet and have sold it to a manager\nwho has produced it, your work is not yet done.  You watch it in\nrehearsal, and during the “breaking in” weeks you cut it here,\nchange it there, make a plot-line do double duty as a laugh-line\nin this spot, take away a needless word from another–until your\nplaylet flashes a flawless gem from the stage.  The final effect\nin the medium of expression for which you write it is UNITY.  Every\npart–acting, dialogue, action–blends in a perfect whole.  Not\neven one word may be taken away without disturbing the total effect\nof its vital oneness.",
        "If you were asked, “What is a one-act musical comedy?” you might\nanswer:  “Let’s see, a one-act musical comedy is–is–. Well, all\nI remember is a lot of pretty girls who changed their clothes every\nfew minutes, two lovers who sang about the moon, a funny couple\nand a whole lot of music.”",
        "Hazy?  Not at all.  This is really a clear and reasonably correct\ndefinition of the average one-act musical colnedy, for this type\nof act is usually about fifty per cent. girl, twenty per cent.\ncostumes and scenery, twenty-five per cent. music, and usually,\nbut not always, five per cent. comedy.  A musical comedy, therefore,\nis not music and comedy–it is girls and music.  That is why the\ntrade name of this, one of the most pleasing of vaudeville acts,\nis–a girl-act.”",
        "It was the girl-act, perhaps more than any other one style of act,\nthat helped to build vaudeville up to its present high standing.\nOn nearly every bill of the years that are past there was a girl-act.\nIt is a form of entertainment that pleases young and old, and\ncoming in the middle or toward the end of a varied program, it\nlends a touch of romance and melody without which many vaudeville\nbills would seem incomplete.",
        "A girl-act is a picture, too.  Moreover, it holds a touch of\nbigness, due to the number of its people, their changing costumes,\nand the length of time the act holds the stage.  With its tuneful\nhaste, its swiftly moving events, its rapid dialogue, its succession\nof characters, and its ever-changing, colorful pictures, the one-act\nmusical comedy is not so much written as put together.",
        "Technically known as a girl-act, and booked by managers who wish\na “flash\"–a big effect–the one-act musical comedy naturally puts\nits best foot foremost as soon as the curtain rises.  And, equally\nof course, it builds up its effects into a concluding best-foot.",
        "The best-foot of a musical comedy is the ensemble number, in which\nall the characters–save the principals, sometimes–join in a\nrousing song.  The ensemble is musical comedy, and one-act musical\ncomedy is–let this exaggeration clinch the truth–the ensemble. [1]",
        "[1] Of course, I am discussing the usual musical comedy–the flash\nof a bill–in pointing out so forcefully the value of the ensemble.\nThere have been some fine one-act musical comedies in which the\nensemble was not used at all.  Indeed, the musical comedy in one\nact without any ensemble offers most promising possibilities.",
        "Between the opening and the closing ensembles there is usually one\nother ensemble number, and sometimes two.  And between these three\nor four ensembles there are usually one or two single numbers–solos\nby a man or a woman–and a duet, or a trio, or a quartet.  These\nform the musical element of the one-act musical comedy.",
        "While the one-act musical comedy may be played in one set of scenery\nonly, it very often happens that there are two or three different\nscenes.  The act may open in One, as did Joe Hart’s “If We Said\nWhat We Thought,” and then go into Full Stage; or it may open in\nFull Stage, go into One for a little musical number, and then go\nback into a different full-stage scene for its finish.  It may\neven be divided into three big scenes–each played in a different\nset–with two interesting numbers in One, if time permits, or the\nact be planned to make its appeal by spectacular effects.",
        "Very often, as in Lasky’s “A Night on a Houseboat,” a big set-piece\nor a trick scene is used to give an effect of difference, although\nthe entire act is played without dropping a curtain.",
        "To sum up the idea behind the use of musical comedy scenery:  it\nis designed to present an effect of bigness–to make the audience\nfeel they are viewing a “production.”",
        "The same thought is behind the continual costume changes which are\nan integral part of the one-act musical comedy effect.  For each\nensemble number the girls’ costumes are changed.  If there are\nthree ensembles there are three costumes, and four changes if there\nare four ensembles.  Needless to say, it sometimes keeps the girls\nhustling every minute the act is in progress, changing from one\ncostume to another, and taking that one off to don a third or a\nfourth.",
        "The result in spectacular effect is as though a scene were changed\nevery time an ensemble number is sung.  Furthermore, the lights\nare so contrived as to add to this effect of difference, and the\ncombination of different colors playing over different costumes,\nmoving about in different sets, forms an ever-changing picture\ndelightfully pleasing and big.",
        "Now, as the musical comedy depends for its appeal upon musical\nvolume, numbers of people, sometimes shifting scenery, a kaleidoscopic\neffect of pretty girls in ever changing costumes and dancing about\nto catchy music, it does not have to lean upon a fascinating plot\nor brilliant dialogue, in order to succeed.  But of course, as we\nshall see, a good story and funny dialogue make a good musical\ncomedy better.",
        "If your memory and my recollection of numerous musical comedies\nof both the one-act and the longer production of the legitimate\nstage are to be trusted, a plot is something not vital to the\nsuccess of a musical comedy.  Indeed, it is actually true that\nmany a musical comedy has failed because the emphasis was placed\non plot rather than on a skeleton of a story which showed the\nlarger elements to the best advantage.  Therefore I present the\nplot element of the average one-act musical comedy thus:",
        "Whereas the opening and the finish of the playlet are two of its\nmost difficult parts to write, in the musical comedy the beginning\nand the finish are ready-made to the writer’s hand.  However anxious\nhe may be to introduce a novel twist of plot at the end, the writer\nis debarred from doing so, because he must finish with an ensemble\nnumber where the appeal is made by numbers of people, costumes,\npretty girls and music.  At the beginning, however, the writer may\nbe as unconventional as he pleases–providing he does not take too\nlong to bring on his first ensemble, and so disappoint his audience,\nwho are waiting for the music and the girls.  Therefore the writer\nmust be content to “tag on” his plot to an opening nearly always–\nif not always–indicated, and to round his plot out into an almost\ninvariably specified ending.",
        "Between the opening and the closing ensembles the writer has to\nfigure on at least one, and maybe more, ensembles, and a solo and\na duet, or a trio and a quartet, or other combinations of these\nmusical elements.  These demands restrict his plot still further.\nHe must indeed make his plot so slight that it will lead out from\nand blend into the overshadowing stage effects.  Necessarily, his\nplot must first serve the demands of scenery and musical numbers–\nthen and only then may his plot be whatever he can make it.",
        "The one important rule for the making of a musical comedy plot is\nthis:  The plot of a one-act musical comedy should be considered\nas made up of story and comedy elements so spaced that the time\nnecessary for setting scenery and changing costumes is neither too\nlong nor too short.",
        "More than one dress rehearsal on the night before opening has been\nwisely devoted to the precise rehearsing of musical numbers and\ncostume changes only.  The dialogue was never even hastily spoken.\nThe entire effort was directed to making the entrances and exits\nof the chorus and principals on time.  “For,” the producer cannily\nreasons, “if they slip up on the dialogue they can fake it–but\nthe slightest wait on a musical number will seem like a mortal\nwound.”",
        "If you recall any of Jesse L. Lasky’s famous musical acts, “A Night\nat the Country Club,” “At the Waldorf,” “The Love Waltz,” “The\nSong Shop” (these come readily to mind, but for the life of me I\ncannot recall even one incident of any of their plots), you will\nrealize how important is the correct timing of musical numbers.\nYou will also understand how unimportant to a successful vaudeville\nmusical comedy is its plot.",
        "As there is no time for studied character analysis and plot\nexposition, and little time for dialogue, the story of a musical\ncomedy must be told by broad strokes.  When you read “A Persian\nGarden,” selected for full reproduction in the Appendix because\nit is one of the best examples of a well-balanced musical comedy\nplot ever seen in vaudeville, you will understand why so careful\na constructionist as Edgar Allan Woolf begins his act with the\nfollowing broad stroke:",
        "The opening chorus has been sung, and instantly an old man’s voice\nis heard off stage.  Then all the chorus girls run up and say,\n\"Oh, here comes the old Sheik now.”",
        "Again, when Paul wishes to be alone with Rose, Mr. Woolf makes\nPaul turn to Phil and say, “What did I tell you to do?”  Then Phil\nseizes Mrs. Schuyler and runs her off the stage into the house.",
        "Mr. Woolf’s skill built this very broad stroke up into a comedy\nexit good for a laugh, but you and I have seen other exits where\nthe comedy was lacking and the mechanics stood out even more boldly.",
        "So we see that the same time-restriction which makes a musical\ncomedy plot a skeleton, also makes the exits and entrances and the\ndialogue and every happening structurally a skeleton so loosely\njointed that it would rattle horribly–were it not for the beautiful\ncovering of the larger effects of costumes, scenery and music.\nTherefore the overshadowing necessity for speed makes admissible\nin the musical comedy broad strokes that would not be tolerated\nanywhere else.",
        "It is by willingly granting this necessary license that the audience\nis permitted to enjoy many single musical numbers and delightful\nensembles within the time-limits vaudeville can afford for anyone\nact.  So we see why it is–to return to the bald expository statement\nwith which this division begins–that the writer must consider his\nstory and his comedy scenes only as time-fillers to make the waits\nbetween musical numbers pleasantly interesting and laughter-worthwhile.",
        "Plainly recognizing the quickness with which one character must\nbe brought on the stage and taken off again, and thoroughly\nappreciating that whatever is done between the musical numbers\nmust be speedily dismissed, let us now see what forms of comedy\nare possible.",
        "Obviously the comedy cannot depend upon delicate shades.  It must\nbe the sort of comedy that is physical rather than mental.\nSlap-stick comedy would seem to be the surest to succeed.",
        "But while this is true, there is no need to depend entirely on the\nslap-stick brand of humor.  For instance, while we find in “A\nPersian Garden” one whole comedy scene built on the killing of\nmosquitoes on Phil’s face–certainly the slap-stick brand, even\nthough a hand delivers the slap–we also have the comedy of character\nin Mrs. Schuyler’s speeches.",
        "Comedy rising directly out of and dependent upon plot, however,\nis not the sort of comedy that usually gives the best results,\nbecause plot is nearly always subservient to the musical and picture\nmaking elements.  But the comedy element of plot may be made to\nrun throughout and can be used with good effect, if it is the kind\nthat is easily dismissed and brought back.  This is why so many\nmusical comedies have made use of plots hinged on mistaken identity,\nKings and Princesses in masquerade, and wives and husbands anxiously\navoiding each other and forever meeting unexpectedly.",
        "Still, plot-comedy may be depended upon for at least one big scene,\nif the idea is big enough.  For instance, the internationally\nsuccessful “The Naked Truth” possessed a plot that was big enough\nto carry the musical comedy on plot-interest alone, if that were\nnecessary.  Indeed, it might have been used as a good farce without\nmusic.  The whole act hung on a magic statue in whose presence\nnothing but the truth could be told, on pain of parting from one’s\nclothes.  And the comedy scenes that developed out of it carried\na series of twists and turns of real plot-interest that made the\nmusical numbers all the more delightful and the whole act a notable\nsuccess.  The musical element of this delightful vaudeville form\nmakes certain other humorous acts fit into the musical comedy\nstructure.  For instance, if the comedy character is left alone\non the stage, he can with perfect propriety deliver a short\nmonologue.  Or he may do anything else that will win laughter and\napplause.",
        "And the two-act, even more perfectly than the monologue, fits into\nthe musical comedy.  No matter what the two-act is, if it is short\nand humorous, it may be used for one of the ornamental time-gap\nstoppers.  A quarrel scene may be just what is needed to fill out\nand advance the plot.  But more often, the flirtation two-act is\nthe form that best suits, for the nature of the musical comedy\nseems best expressed by love and its romantic moments.  Indeed,\nthe flirtation two-act is often a little musical comedy in itself,\nminus a background of girls.  As an example, take Louis Weslyn’s\nvery successful two-act, “After the Shower.” [1] You can easily\nimagine all the other girls in the camping party appearing, to act\nas the chorus.  Then suppply a talkative chaperon, and you have\nonly to add her comical husband to produce a fine musical comedy\noffering.",
        "[1] See the Appendix.",
        "So we see once more that the one-act musical comedy is the result\nof assembling, rather than of writing.  There is no need of adding\neven one instruction paragraph here.",
        "Before we take up the one or two hints on writing that would seem\nto present themselves in helpful guise, you should read Edgar Allan\nWoolf’s “A Persian Garden.”  Turn to the Appendix and this act\nwill show you clearly how the writer welds these different vaudeville\nforms into one perfect whole.",
