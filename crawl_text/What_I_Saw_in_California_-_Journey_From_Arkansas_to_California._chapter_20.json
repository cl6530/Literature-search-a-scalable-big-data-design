        "The following general view of the nature of the country which divides\nthe United States from California is taken from a narrative, published\nby Lieutenant Emory, of a journey from the Arkansas to the newly\nannexed territory of the United States.",
        "“The country,” says the lieutenant, “from the Arkansas to the Colorado,\na distance of over 1200 miles, in its adaptation to agriculture, has\npeculiarities which must for ever stamp itself upon the population\nwhich inhabits it. All North Mexico, embracing New Mexico, Chihuahua,\nSonora, and the Californias, as far north as the Sacramento, is, as far\nas the best information goes, the same in the physical character of its\nsurface, and differs but little in climate and products. In no part of\nthis vast tract can the rains from heaven be relied upon, to any\nextent, for the cultivation of the soil. The earth is destitute of\ntrees, and in great part also of any vegetation whatever. A few feeble\nstreams flow in different directions from the great mountains, which in\nmany places traverse this region. These streams are separated,\nsometimes by plains, and sometimes by mountains, without water and\nwithout vegetation, and may be called deserts, so far as they perform\nany useful part in the sustenance of animal life.",
        "“The whole extent of country, except on the margin of streams, is\ndestitute of forest trees. The Apaches, a very numerous race, and the\nNavajoes, are the chief occupants, but there are many minor bands, who,\nunlike the Apaches and Navajoes, are not nomadic, but have fixed\nhabitations. Amongst the most remarkable of these are the Soones, most\nof whom are said to be Albinoes. The latter cultivate the soil, and\nlive in peace with their more numerous and savage neighbours. Departing\nfrom the ford of the Colorado in the direction of Sonora, there is a\nfearful desert to encounter. Alter, a small town, with a Mexican\ngarrison, is the nearest settlement. All accounts concur in\nrepresenting the journey as one of extreme hardship, and even peril.\nThe distance is not exactly known, but it is variously represented at\nfrom four to seven days’ journey. Persons bound for Sonora from\nCalifornia, who do not mind a circuitous route, should ascend the Gila\nas far as the Pimos village, and thence penetrate the province by way\nof Tucson. At the ford, the Colorado is 1,500 feet wide, and flows at\nthe rate of a mile and a half per hour. Its greatest depth in the\nchannel, at the ford where we crossed, is four feet. The banks are low,\nnot more than four feet high, and, judging from indications, sometimes,\nthough not frequently, overflowed. Its general appearance at this point\nis much like that of the Arkansas, with its turbid waters and shifting\nsand islands.”",
        "The narrative of Lieut. Emory, of his journey from this point across\nthe Desert of California, becomes highly interesting and\ncharacteristic.",
        "“November 26.–The dawn of day found every man on horseback, and a\nbunch of grass from the Colorado tied behind him on the cantle of his\nsaddle. After getting well under way, the keen air at 26° Fahrenheit\nmade it most comfortable to walk. We travelled four miles along the\nsand butte, in a southern direction; we mounted the buttes and found a\nfirmer footing covered with fragments of lava, rounded by water, and\nmany agates. We were now fairly on the desert.",
        "“Our course now inclined a few degrees more to the north, and at 10,\nA.M., we found a large patch of grama, where we halted for an hour, and\nthen pursued our way over the plains covered with fragments of lava,\ntraversed at intervals by sand buttes, until 4, P.M., when, after\ntravelling 24 miles, we reached the Alamo or cotton-wood. At this\npoint, the Spaniards informed us, that, failing to find water, they had\ngone a league to the west, in pursuit of their horses, where they found\na running stream. We accordingly sent parties to search, but neither\nthe water nor their trail could be found. Neither was there any\ncotton-wood at the Alamo, as its name would signify; but it was\nnevertheless the place, the tree having probably been covered by the\nencroachments of the sand, which here terminates in a bluff 40 feet\nhigh, making the arc of a great circle convexing to the north.\nDescending this bluff, we found in what had been the channel of a\nstream, now overgrown with a few ill-conditioned mesquite, a large hole\nwhere persons had evidently dug for water. It was necessary to halt to\nrest our animals, and the time was occupied in deepening this hole,\nwhich, after a strong struggle, showed signs of water. An old champagne\nbasket, used by one of the officers as a pannier, was lowered in the\nhole, to prevent the crumbling of the sand. After many efforts to keep\nout the caving sand, a basket-work of willow twigs effected the object,\nand, much to the joy of all, the basket, which was now 15 or 20 feet\nbelow the surface, filled with water. The order was given for each mess\nto draw a kettle of water, and Captain Turner was placed in charge of\nthe spring, to see fair distribution.",
        "“When the messes were supplied, the firmness of the banks gave hopes\nthat the animals might be watered, and each party was notified to have\ntheir animals in waiting; the important business of watering then\ncommenced, upon the success of which depended the possibility of their\nadvancing with us a foot further. Two buckets for each animal were\nallowed. At 10, A.M., when my turn came, Captain Moore had succeeded,\nby great exertions, in opening another well, and the one already opened\nbegan to flow more freely, in consequence of which, we could afford to\ngive each animal as much as it could drink. The poor brutes, none of\nwhich had tasted water in forty-eight hours, and some not for the last\nsixty, clustered round the well and scrambled for precedence. At 12\no’clock I had watered all my animals, thirty-seven in number, and\nturned over the well to Captain Moore. The animals still had an aching\nvoid to fill, and all night was heard the munching of sticks, and their\npiteous cries for more congenial food.",
        "“November 27 and 28.–To-day we started a few minutes after sunrise.\nOur course was a winding one, to avoid the sand-drifts. The Mexicans\nhad informed us that the waters of the salt lake, some thirty or forty\nmiles distant, were too salt to use, but other information led us to\nthink the intelligence was wrong. We accordingly tried to reach it;\nabout 3, P.M., we disengaged ourselves from the sand, and went due\n(magnetic) west, over an immense level of clay detritus, hard and\nsmooth as a bowling-green. The desert was almost destitute of\nvegetation; now and then an Ephedra, Oenothera, or bunches of Aristida\nwere seen, and occasionally the level was covered with a growth of\nObione canescens, and a low bush with small oval plaited leaves,\nunknown. The heavy sand had proved too much for many horses and some\nmules, and all the efforts of their drivers could bring them no further\nthan the middle of this desert. About 8 o’clock, as we approached the\nlake, the stench of dead animals confirmed the reports of the Mexicans,\nand put to flight all hopes of being able to use the water.",
        "“The basin of the lake, as well as I could judge at night, is about\nthree-quarters of a mile long and half a mile wide. The water had\nreceded to a pool, diminished to one half its size, and the approach to\nit, was through a thick soapy quagmire. It was wholly unfit for man or\nbrute, and we studiously kept the latter from it, thinking that the use\nof it would but aggravate their thirst. One or two of the men came in\nlate, and, rushing to the lake, threw themselves down and took many\nswallows before discovering their mistake; but the effect was not\ninjurious except that it increased their thirst. A few mezquite trees\nand a chenopodiaceous shrub bordered the lake, and on these our mules\nmunched till they had sufficiently refreshed themselves, when the call\nto saddle was sounded, and we groped silently our way in the dark. The\nstoutest animals now began to stagger, and when day dawned scarcely a\nman was seen mounted.",
        "“With the sun rose a heavy fog from the south-west, no doubt from the\ngulf, and, sweeping towards us, enveloped us for two or three hours,\nwetting our blankets and giving relief to the animals. Before it had\ndisappeared we came to a patch of sun-burned grass. When the fog had\nentirely dispersed we found ourselves entering a gap in the mountains,\nwhich had been before us for four days. The plain was crossed, but we\nhad not yet found water. The first valley we reached was dry, and it\nwas not till 12 o’clock, M., that we struck the Cariso (cane) creek,\nwithin half a mile of one of its sources, and although so close to the\nsource, the sands had already absorbed much of its water, and left but\nlittle running. A mile or two below, the creek entirely disappears. We\nhalted, having made fifty-four miles in the two days, at the source, a\nmagnificent spring, twenty or thirty feet in diameter, highly\nimpregnated with sulphur, and medicinal in its properties.",
        "“The desert over which we had passed, ninety miles from water to water,\nis an immense triangular plain, bounded on one side by the Colorado, on\nthe west by the Cordilleras of California, the coast chain of mountains\nwhich now encircles us, extending from the Sacramento river to the\nsouthern extremity of Lower California, and on the north-east by a\nchain of mountains, running southeast and northwest. It is chiefly\ncovered with floating sand, the surface of which in various places is\nwhite, with diminutive spinelas, and everywhere over the whole surface\nis found the large and soft muscle shell. I have noted the only two\npatches of grass found during the ’jornada.’ There were scattered, at\nwide intervals, the Palafoxia linearis, Atriplex, Encelia farinosa,\nDaleas, Euphorbias, and a Simsia, described by Dr. Torrey as a new\nspecies.",
        "“The southern termination of this desert is bounded by the Tecaté chain\nof mountains and the Colorado; but its northern and eastern boundaries\nare undefined, and I should suppose from the accounts of trappers, and\nothers, who have attempted the passage from California to the Gila by a\nmore northern route, that it extends many days’ travel beyond the chain\nof barren mountains which bound the horizon in that direction. The\nportal to the mountains through which we passed was formed by immense\nbuttes of yellow clay and sand, with large flakes of mica and seams of\ngypsum. Nothing could be more forlorn and desolate in appearance. The\ngypsum had given some consistency to the sand buttes, which were washed\ninto fantastic figures. One ridge formed apparently a complete circle,\ngiving it the appearance of a crater; and although some miles to the\nleft, I should have gone to visit it, supposing it to be a crater, but\nmy mule was sinking with thirst, and water was yet at some distance.\nMany animals were left on the road to die of thirst and hunger, in\nspite of the generous efforts of the men to bring them to the spring.\nMore than one was brought up, by one man tugging at the halter and\nanother pushing up the brute, by placing his shoulder against its\nbuttocks. Our most serious loss, perhaps, was that of one or two fat\nmares and colts brought with us for food; for, before leaving camp,\nMajor Swords found in a concealed place one of the best pack mules\nslaughtered, and the choice bits cut from his shoulders and flanks,\nstealthily done by some mess less provident than others.",
        "“Nov. 29.–The grass at the spring was anything but desirable for our\nhorses, and there was scarcely a ration left for the men. This last\nconsideration would not prevent our giving the horses a day’s rest\nwherever grass could be found. We followed the dry sandy bed of the\nCariso nearly all day, at a snail’s pace, and at length reached the\n’little pools’ where the grass was luxuriant but very salt. The water\nstrongly resembled that at the head of the Cariso creek, and the earth,\nwhich was very tremulous for many acres about the pools, was covered\nwith salt. This valley is not more than half a mile wide, and on each\nside are mountains of grey granite and pure quartz, rising from 1,000\nto 3,000 feet above it.",
        "“We rode for miles through thickets of the centennial plant, Agave\nAmericana, and found one in full bloom. The sharp thorns terminating\nevery leaf of this plant were a great annoyance to our dismounted and\nwearied men, whose legs were now almost bare. A number of these plants\nwere cut by the soldiers, and the body of them used as food. The day\nwas intensely hot, and the sand deep; the animals, inflated with water\nand rushes, gave way by scores; and although we advanced only sixteen\nmiles, many did not arrive at camp until 10 o’clock at night. It was a\nfeast day for the wolves, which followed in packs close on our track,\nseizing our deserted brutes, and making the air resound with their\nhowls as they battled for the carcases.",
        "“December 12.–We followed the Solidad through a deep fertile valley\nin the shape of a cross. Here we ascended to the left a steep hill to\nthe table lands, which, keeping for a few miles, we descended into a\nwaterless valley, leading into False Bay at a point distant two or\nthree miles from San Diego. At this place we were in view of the fort\noverlooking the town of San Diego and the barren waste which surrounds\nit.",
        "“The town consists of a few adobe houses, two or three of which only\nhave plank floors. It is situated at the foot of a high hill on a sand\nflat, two miles wide, reaching from the head of San Diego Bay to False\nBay. A high promontory, of nearly the same width, runs into the sea\nfour or five miles, and is connected by the flat with the main land.\nThe road to the hide-houses leads on the east side of this promontory,\nand abreast of them the frigate Congress and the sloop Portsmouth are\nat anchor. The hide-houses are a collection of store-houses where the\nhides of cattle are packed before being shipped, this article forming\nthe only trade of the little town.",
        "“The bay is a narrow arm of the sea indenting the land some four or\nfive miles, easily defended, and having twenty feet of water at the\nlowest tide. The rise is five feet, making the greatest water\ntwenty-five feet.",
        "“Standing on the hill which overlooks the town, and looking to the\nnorth-east, I saw the mission of San Diego, a fine large building now\ndeserted. The Rio San Diego runs under ground in a direct course from\nthe mission to the town, and, sweeping around the hill, discharges\nitself into the bay. Its original debouche was into False bay, where,\nmeeting the waters rolling in from the seaward, a bar was formed by the\ndeposit of sand, making the entrance of False Bay impracticable.",
        "“January 2.–Six and a half miles’ march brought us to the deserted\nmission of San Luis Rey. The keys of this mission were in charge of the\nalcalde of the Indian village, a mile distant. He was at the door to\nreceive us and deliver up possession. There we halted for the day, to\nlet the sailors, who suffered dreadfully from sore feet, recruit a\nlittle. This building is one which, for magnitude, convenience, and\ndurability of architecture, would do honour to any country.",
        "“The walls are adobe, and the roofs of well-made tile. It was built\nabout sixty years since by the Indians of the country, under the\nguidance of a zealous priest. At that time the Indians were very\nnumerous, and under the absolute sway of the missionaries. These\nmissionaries at one time bid fair to christianize the Indians of\nCalifornia. Under grants from the Mexican government, they collected\nthem into missions, built immense houses, and began successfully to\ntill the soil by the hands of the Indians for the benefit of the\nIndians.",
        "“The habits of the priests, and the avarice of the military rulers of\nthe territory, however, soon converted these missions into instruments\nof oppression and slavery of the Indian race.",
        "“The revolution of 1836 saw the downfall of the priests, and most of\nthese missions passed by fraud into the hands of private individuals,\nand with them the Indians were transferred as serfs of the land.",
        "“This race, which, in our country, has never been reduced to slavery,\nis in that degraded condition throughout California, and does the only\nlabour performed in the country. Nothing can exceed their present\ndegradation.”",
        "The general closing remarks of Lieutenant Emory are as follow:",
        "“The region extending from the head of the Gulf of California to the\nparallel of the Pueblo, or Ciudad de los Angeles, is the only portion\nnot heretofore covered by my own notes and journal, or by the notes and\njournals of other scientific expeditions fitted out by the United\nStates. The journals and published accounts of these several\nexpeditions combined will give definite ideas of all those portions of\nCalifornia susceptible of cultivation or settlement. From this remark\nis to be excepted the vast basin watered by the Colorado, and the\ncountry lying between that river and the range of Cordilleras,\nrepresented as running east of the Tulare lakes, and south of the\nparallel of 36°, and the country between the Colorado and Gila rivers.",
        "“Of these regions nothing is known except from the reports of trappers,\nand the speculations of geologists. As far as these accounts go, all\nconcur in representing it as a waste of sand and rock, unadorned with\nvegetation, poorly watered, and unfit, it is believed, for any of the\nuseful purposes of life. A glance at the map will show what an immense\narea is embraced in these boundaries; and, notwithstanding the oral\naccounts in regard to it, it is difficult to bring the mind to the\nbelief in the existence of such a sea of waste and desert; when every\nother grand division of the earth presents some prominent feature in\nthe economy of nature, administering to the wants of man. Possibly this\nunexplored region may be filled with valuable minerals.",
        "“Where irrigation can be had in this country, the produce of the soil\nis abundant beyond description. All the grains and fruits of the\ntemperate zones, and many of those of the tropical, flourish\nluxuriantly. Descending from the heights of San Barnardo to the Pacific\none meets every degree of temperature. Near the coast, the winds\nprevailing from the south-west in winter, and from the north-west in\nsummer, produce a great uniformity of temperature, and the climate is\nperhaps unsurpassed in salubrity. With the exception of a very few\ncases of ague and fever of a mild type, sickness is unknown.",
        "“The season of the year at which we visited the country was\nunfavourable to obtaining a knowledge of its botany. The vegetation,\nmostly deciduous, had gone to decay, and no flowers nor seeds were\ncollected. The country generally is entirely destitute of trees. Along\nthe principal range of the mountains are a few live oaks, sycamore and\npine; now and then, but very rarely, the sycamore and cotton-wood occur\nin the champaign country, immediately on the margins of the streams.\nWild oats everywhere cover the surface of the hills, and these, with\nthe wild mustard and carrots, furnish good pasturage to the immense\nherds of cattle which form the staple of California. Of the many fruits\ncapable of being produced with success, by culture and irrigation, the\ngrape is perhaps that which is brought nearest to perfection.\nExperienced wine-growers and Europeans, pronounce this portion of\nCalifornia unequalled for the quality of its wines.”",
