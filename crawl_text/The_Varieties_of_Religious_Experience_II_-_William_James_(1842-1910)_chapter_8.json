        "The road by which William James arrived at his position of\nleadership among American philosophers was, during his childhood,\nyouth and early maturity, quite as circuitous and unpredictable\nas were his father’s ideas on the training of his children. That\nSwedenborgian theologian foresaw neither the career of novelist\nfor his son Henry, nor that of pragmatist philosopher for the\nolder William.  The father’s migrations between New York, Europe\nand Newport meant that William’s education had variety if it did\nnot have fixed direction.  From 13 to 18 he studied in Europe and\nreturned to Newport, Rhode Island, to study painting under the\nguidance of John La Farge.  After a year, he gave up art for\nscience and entered Harvard University, where his most\ninfluential teachers were Louis Agassiz and Charles W. Eliot. \nIn 1863, William James began the study of medicine, and in 1865\nhe joined an expedition to the Amazon. Before long, he wrote: \n“If there is anything I hate, it is collecting.” His studies\nconstantly interrupted by ill health, James returned to Germany\nand began hearing lectures and reading voluminously in\nphilosophy.  He won his medical degree at Harvard in 1870.  For\nfour years he was an invalid in Cambridge, but finally, in 1873,\nhe passed his gravest physical and spiritual crises and began the\ncareer by which he was to influence so profoundly generations of\nAmerican students.  From 1880 to 1907 he was successively\nassistant professor of philosophy, professor of psychology and\nprofessor of philosophy at Harvard.  In 1890, the publication of\nhis Principles of Psycholog brought him the acknowledged\nleadership in the field of functional psychology.  The selection\nof William James to deliver the Gifford lectures in Edinburgh was\nat once a tribute to him and a reward for the university that\nsponsored the undertaking.  These lectures, collected in this\nvolume, have since become famous as the standard scientific work\non the psychology of the religious impulse.  Death ended his\ncareer on August 27th, 1910.",
