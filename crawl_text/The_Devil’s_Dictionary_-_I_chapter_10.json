        "I is the first letter of the alphabet, the first word of the language, \nthe first thought of the mind, the first object of affection.  In \ngrammar it is a pronoun of the first person and singular number.  Its \nplural is said to be We, but how there can be more than one myself \nis doubtless clearer the grammarians than it is to the author of this \nincomparable dictionary.  Conception of two myselfs is difficult, but \nfine.  The frank yet graceful use of “I” distinguishes a good writer \nfrom a bad; the latter carries it with the manner of a thief trying to \ncloak his loot.",

        "\nICONOCLAST, n.  A breaker of idols, the worshipers whereof are \nimperfectly gratified by the performance, and most strenuously protest \nthat he unbuildeth but doth not reedify, that he pulleth down but \npileth not up.  For the poor things would have other idols in place of \nthose he thwacketh upon the mazzard and dispelleth.  But the \niconoclast saith:  “Ye shall have none at all, for ye need them not; \nand if the rebuilder fooleth round hereabout, behold I will depress \nthe head of him and sit thereon till he squawk it.”",
        "IDIOT, n.  A member of a large and powerful tribe whose influence in \nhuman affairs has always been dominant and controlling.  The Idiot’s \nactivity is not confined to any special field of thought or action, \nbut “pervades and regulates the whole.”  He has the last word in \neverything; his decision is unappealable.  He sets the fashions and \nopinion of taste, dictates the limitations of speech and circumscribes \nconduct with a dead-line.",

        "\nIMPALE, v.t.  In popular usage to pierce with any weapon which remains \nfixed in the wound.  This, however, is inaccurate; to imaple is, \nproperly, to put to death by thrusting an upright sharp stake into the \nbody, the victim being left in a sitting position.  This was a common \nmode of punishment among many of the nations of antiquity, and is \nstill in high favor in China and other parts of Asia.  Down to the \nbeginning of the fifteenth century it was widely employed in \n“churching” heretics and schismatics.  Wolecraft calls it the “stoole \nof repentynge,” and among the common people it was jocularly known as \n“riding the one legged horse.”  Ludwig Salzmann informs us that in \nThibet impalement is considered the most appropriate punishment for \ncrimes against religion; and although in China it is sometimes awarded \nfor secular offences, it is most frequently adjudged in cases of \nsacrilege.  To the person in actual experience of impalement it must \nbe a matter of minor importance by what kind of civil or religious \ndissent he was made acquainted with its discomforts; but doubtless he \nwould feel a certain satisfaction if able to contemplate himself in \nthe character of a weather-cock on the spire of the True Church.",

        "  His tale he told with a solemn face\n  And a tender, melancholy grace.\n      Improbable ’twas, no doubt,\n      When you came to think it out,\n      But the fascinated crowd\n      Their deep surprise avowed\n  And all with a single voice averred\n  ’Twas the most amazing thing they’d heard —\n  All save one who spake never a word,\n      But sat as mum\n      As if deaf and dumb,\n  Serene, indifferent and unstirred.\n      Then all the others turned to him\n      And scrutinized him limb from limb —\n      Scanned him alive;\n      But he seemed to thrive\n      And tranquiler grow each minute,\n      As if there were nothing in it.\n  “What! what!” cried one, “are you not amazed\n  At what our friend has told?”  He raised\n  Soberly then his eyes and gazed\n      In a natural way\n      And proceeded to say,\n  As he crossed his feet on the mantel-shelf:\n  “O no — not at all; I’m a liar myself.”",

        "INADMISSIBLE, adj.  Not competent to be considered.  Said of certain \nkinds of testimony which juries are supposed to be unfit to be \nentrusted with, and which judges, therefore, rule out, even of \nproceedings before themselves alone.  Hearsay evidence is inadmissible \nbecause the person quoted was unsworn and is not before the court for \nexamination; yet most momentous actions, military, political, \ncommercial and of every other kind, are daily undertaken on hearsay \nevidence.  There is no religion in the world that has any other basis \nthan hearsay evidence.  Revelation is hearsay evidence; that the \nScriptures are the word of God we have only the testimony of men long \ndead whose identity is not clearly established and who are not known \nto have been sworn in any sense.  Under the rules of evidence as they \nnow exist in this country, no single assertion in the Bible has in its \nsupport any evidence admissible in a court of law.  It cannot be \nproved that the battle of Blenheim ever was fought, that there was \nsuch as person as Julius Caesar, such an empire as Assyria.",
        "But as records of courts of justice are admissible, it can easily \nbe proved that powerful and malevolent magicians once existed and were \na scourge to mankind.  The evidence (including confession) upon which \ncertain women were convicted of witchcraft and executed was without a \nflaw; it is still unimpeachable.  The judges’ decisions based on it \nwere sound in logic and in law.  Nothing in any existing court was \never more thoroughly proved than the charges of witchcraft and sorcery \nfor which so many suffered death.  If there were no witches, human \ntestimony and human reason are alike destitute of value.",
        "INAUSPICIOUSLY, adv.  In an unpromising manner, the auspices being \nunfavorable.  Among the Romans it was customary before undertaking any \nimportant action or enterprise to obtain from the augurs, or state \nprophets, some hint of its probable outcome; and one of their favorite \nand most trustworthy modes of divination consisted in observing the \nflight of birds — the omens thence derived being called auspices.  \nNewspaper reporters and certain miscreant lexicographers have decided \nthat the word — always in the plural — shall mean “patronage” or \n“management\"; as, “The festivities were under the auspices of the \nAncient and Honorable Order of Body-Snatchers\"; or, “The hilarities \nwere auspicated by the Knights of Hunger.”",
        "  A Roman slave appeared one day\n  Before the Augur.  “Tell me, pray,\n  If —” here the Augur, smiling, made\n  A checking gesture and displayed\n  His open palm, which plainly itched,\n  For visibly its surface twitched.\n  A denarius (the Latin nickel)\n  Successfully allayed the tickle,\n  And then the slave proceeded:  “Please\n  Inform me whether Fate decrees\n  Success or failure in what I\n  To-night (if it be dark) shall try.\n  Its nature?  Never mind — I think\n  ’Tis writ on this” — and with a wink\n  Which darkened half the earth, he drew\n  Another denarius to view,\n  Its shining face attentive scanned,\n  Then slipped it into the good man’s hand,\n  Who with great gravity said:  “Wait\n  While I retire to question Fate.\"\n  That holy person then withdrew\n  His scared clay and, passing through\n  The temple’s rearward gate, cried “Shoo!\"\n  Waving his robe of office.  Straight\n  Each sacred peacock and its mate\n  (Maintained for Juno’s favor) fled\n  With clamor from the trees o’erhead,\n  Where they were perching for the night.\n  The temple’s roof received their flight,\n  For thither they would always go,\n  When danger threatened them below.\n  Back to the slave the Augur went:\n  “My son, forecasting the event\n  By flight of birds, I must confess\n  The auspices deny success.\"\n  That slave retired, a sadder man,\n  Abandoning his secret plan —\n  Which was (as well the craft seer\n  Had from the first divined) to clear\n  The wall and fraudulently seize\n  On Juno’s poultry in the trees.",
        "G.J.",
        "\nINCOME, n.  The natural and rational gauge and measure of \nrespectability, the commonly accepted standards being artificial, \narbitrary and fallacious; for, as “Sir Sycophas Chrysolater” in the \nplay has justly remarked, “the true use and function of property (in \nwhatsoever it consisteth — coins, or land, or houses, or merchant- \nstuff, or anything which may be named as holden of right to one’s own \nsubservience) as also of honors, titles, preferments and place, and \nall favor and acquaintance of persons of quality or ableness, are but \nto get money.  Hence it followeth that all things are truly to be \nrated as of worth in measure of their serviceableness to that end; and \ntheir possessors should take rank in agreement thereto, neither the \nlord of an unproducing manor, howsoever broad and ancient, nor he who \nbears an unremunerate dignity, nor yet the pauper favorite of a king, \nbeing esteemed of level excellency with him whose riches are of daily \naccretion; and hardly should they whose wealth is barren claim and \nrightly take more honor than the poor and unworthy.”",
        "INCOMPATIBILITY, n.  In matrimony a similarity of tastes, particularly \nthe taste for domination.  Incompatibility may, however, consist of a \nmeek-eyed matron living just around the corner.  It has even been \nknown to wear a moustache.",
        "INCOMPOSSIBLE, adj.  Unable to exist if something else exists.  Two \nthings are incompossible when the world of being has scope enough for \none of them, but not enough for both — as Walt Whitman’s poetry and \nGod’s mercy to man.  Incompossibility, it will be seen, is only \nincompatibility let loose.  Instead of such low language as “Go heel \nyourself — I mean to kill you on sight,” the words, “Sir, we are \nincompossible,” would convey and equally significant intimation and in \nstately courtesy are altogether superior.",
        "INCUBUS, n.  One of a race of highly improper demons who, though \nprobably not wholly extinct, may be said to have seen their best \nnights.  For a complete account of incubi and succubi, including \nincubae and succubae, see the Liber Demonorum of Protassus \n(Paris, 1328), which contains much curious information that would be \nout of place in a dictionary intended as a text-book for the public \nschools.\n  Victor Hugo relates that in the Channel Islands Satan himself — \ntempted more than elsewhere by the beauty of the women, doubtless — \nsometimes plays at incubus, greatly to the inconvenience and alarm \nof the good dames who wish to be loyal to their marriage vows, \ngenerally speaking.  A certain lady applied to the parish priest to \nlearn how they might, in the dark, distinguish the hardy intruder from \ntheir husbands.  The holy man said they must feel his brown for horns; \nbut Hugo is ungallant enough to hint a doubt of the efficacy of the \ntest.",
        "INCUMBENT, n.  A person of the liveliest interest to the outcumbents.",
        "INDECISION, n.  The chief element of success; “for whereas,” saith Sir \nThomas Brewbold, “there is but one way to do nothing and divers way to \ndo something, whereof, to a surety, only one is the right way, it \nfolloweth that he who from indecision standeth still hath not so many \nchances of going astray as he who pusheth forwards” — a most clear \nand satisfactory exposition on the matter.\n  “Your prompt decision to attack,” said Genera Grant on a certain \noccasion to General Gordon Granger, “was admirable; you had but five \nminutes to make up your mind in.\"\n  “Yes, sir,” answered the victorious subordinate, “it is a great \nthing to be know exactly what to do in an emergency.  When in doubt \nwhether to attack or retreat I never hesitate a moment — I toss us a \ncopper.\"\n  “Do you mean to say that’s what you did this time?\"\n  “Yes, General; but for Heaven’s sake don’t reprimand me:  I \ndisobeyed the coin.”",
        "INDIFFERENT, adj.  Imperfectly sensible to distinctions among things.",
        "  “You tiresome man!” cried Indolentio’s wife,\n  “You’ve grown indifferent to all in life.\"\n  “Indifferent?” he drawled with a slow smile;\n  “I would be, dear, but it is not worth while.”",
        "Apuleius M. Gokul",
        "\nINDIGESTION, n.  A disease which the patient and his friends \nfrequently mistake for deep religious conviction and concern for the \nsalvation of mankind.  As the simple Red Man of the western wild put \nit, with, it must be confessed, a certain force:  “Plenty well, no \npray; big bellyache, heap God.”",

        "INEXPEDIENT, adj.  Not calculated to advance one’s interests.",
        "INFANCY, n.  The period of our lives when, according to Wordsworth, \n“Heaven lies about us.”  The world begins lying about us pretty soon \nafterward.",
        "INFERIAE,n.  [Latin]  Among the Greeks and Romans, sacrifices for \npropitation of the Dii Manes, or souls of the dead heroes; for the \npious ancients could not invent enough gods to satisfy their spiritual \nneeds, and had to have a number of makeshift deities, or, as a sailor \nmight say, jury-gods, which they made out of the most unpromising \nmaterials.  It was while sacrificing a bullock to the spirit of \nAgamemnon that Laiaides, a priest of Aulis, was favored with an \naudience of that illustrious warrior’s shade, who prophetically \nrecounted to him the birth of Christ and the triumph of Christianity, \ngiving him also a rapid but tolerably complete review of events down \nto the reign of Saint Louis.  The narrative ended abruptly at the \npoint, owing to the inconsiderate crowing of a cock, which compelled \nthe ghosted King of Men to scamper back to Hades.  There is a fine \nmediaeval flavor to this story, and as it has not been traced back \nfurther than Pere Brateille, a pious but obscure writer at the court \nof Saint Louis, we shall probably not err on the side of presumption \nin considering it apocryphal, though Monsignor Capel’s judgment of the \nmatter might be different; and to that I bow — wow.",
        "INFIDEL, n.  In New York, one who does not believe in the Christian \nreligion; in Constantinople, one who does.  (See GIAOUR.)

One who ventures to believe that Adam need not have \nsinned unless he had a mind to — in opposition to the \nSupralapsarians, who hold that that luckless person’s fall was decreed \nfrom the beginning.  Infralapsarians are sometimes called \nSublapsarians without material effect upon the importance and lucidity \nof their views about Adam.",

        "INK, n.  A villainous compound of tannogallate of iron, gum-arabic and \nwater, chiefly used to facilitate the infection of idiocy and promote \nintellectual crime.  The properties of ink are peculiar and \ncontradictory:  it may be used to make reputations and unmake them; to \nblacken them and to make them white; but it is most generally and \nacceptably employed as a mortar to bind together the stones of an \nedifice of fame, and as a whitewash to conceal afterward the rascal \nquality of the material.  There are men called journalists who have \nestablished ink baths which some persons pay money to get into, others \nto get out of.

        "INNATE, adj.  Natural, inherent — as innate ideas, that is to say, \nideas that we are born with, having had them previously imparted to \nus.  The doctrine of innate ideas is one of the most admirable faiths \nof philosophy, being itself an innate idea and therefore inaccessible \nto disproof, though Locke foolishly supposed himself to have given it \n“a black eye.”  Among innate ideas may be mentioned the belief in \none’s ability to conduct a newspaper, in the greatness of one’s \ncountry, in the superiority of one’s civilization, in the importance \nof one’s personal affairs and in the interesting nature of one’s \ndiseases.",
        "IN’ARDS, n.  The stomach, heart, soul and other bowels.  Many eminent \ninvestigators do not class the soul as an in’ard, but that acute \nobserver and renowned authority, Dr. Gunsaulus, is persuaded that the \nmysterious organ known as the spleen is nothing less than our \nimportant part.  To the contrary, Professor Garrett P. Servis holds \nthat man’s soul is that prolongation of his spinal marrow which forms \nthe pith of his no tail; and for demonstration of his faith points \nconfidently to the fact that no tailed animals have no souls.  \nConcerning these two theories, it is best to suspend judgment by \nbelieving both.",

In \n      other words, you expect me to bet that my house will not last \n      so long as you say that it will probably last.\n  INSURANCE AGENT:  But if your house burns without insurance it \n      will be a total loss.\n  HOUSE OWNER:  Beg your pardon — by your own actuary’s tables I \n      shall probably have saved, when it burns, all the premiums I \n      would otherwise have paid to you — amounting to more than the \n      face of the policy they would have bought.  But suppose it to \n      burn, uninsured, before the time upon which your figures are \n      based.  If I could not afford that, how could you if it were \n      insured?\n  INSURANCE AGENT:  O, we should make ourselves whole from our \n      luckier ventures with other clients.  Virtually, they pay your \n      loss.\n  HOUSE OWNER:  And virtually, then, don’t I help to pay their \n      losses?  Are not their houses as likely as mine to burn before \n      they have paid you as much as you must pay them?  The case \n      stands this way:  you expect to take more money from your \n      clients than you pay to them, do you not?\n  INSURANCE AGENT:  Certainly; if we did not —\n  HOUSE OWNER:  I would not trust you with my money.  Very well \n      then.  If it is certain, with reference to the whole body of \n      your clients, that they lose money on you it is probable, \n      with reference to any one of them, that he will.  It is \n      these individual probabilities that make the aggregate \n      certainty.\n  INSURANCE AGENT:  I will not deny it — but look at the figures in \n      this pamph —\n  HOUSE OWNER:  Heaven forbid!\n  INSURANCE AGENT:  You spoke of saving the premiums which you would \n      otherwise pay to me.  Will you not be more likely to squander \n      them?  We offer you an incentive to thrift.\n  HOUSE OWNER:  The willingness of A to take care of B’s money is \n      not peculiar to insurance, but as a charitable institution you \n      command esteem.  Deign to accept its expression from a \n      Deserving Object.",
