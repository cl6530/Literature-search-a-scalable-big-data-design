        "It was still early in the evening, but a little after nine o’clock.\nThe Fifth Avenue bus wended its way, jouncing its patrons,\nparticularly those on the top seats, across town, and turned into\nRiverside Drive.  A short distance behind the bus, a limousine\nrolled down the cross street leisurely, silently.",
        "As the lights of passing craft on the Hudson and a myriad\nscintillating, luminous points dotting the west shore came into\nview, Jimmie Dale rose impulsively from his seat on the top of the\nbus, descended the little circular iron ladder at the rear, and\ndropped off into the street.  It was only a few blocks farther to\nhis residence on the Drive, and the night was well worth the walk;\nbesides, restless, disturbed, and perplexed in mind, the walk\nappealed to him.",
        "He stepped across to the sidewalk and proceeded slowly along.  A\nmonth had gone by and he had not heard a word from–HER.  The break\non West Broadway, the murder of Metzer in Moriarty’s gambling hell,\nthe theft of Markel’s diamond necklace had followed each other in\nquick succession–and then this month of utter silence, with no sign\nof her, as though indeed she had never existed.",
        "But it was not this temporary silence on her part that troubled\nJimmie Dale now.  In the years that he had worked with this unknown,\nmysterious accomplice of his whom he had never seen, there had been\nlonger intervals than a bare month in which he had heard nothing\nfrom her–it was not that.  It was the failure, total, absolute, and\ncomplete, that was the only result for the month of ceaseless,\nunremitting, doggedly-expended effort, even as it had been the\nresult many times before, in an attempt to solve the enigma that was\nso intimate and vital a factor in his own life.",
        "If he might lay any claims to cleverness, his resourcefulness, at\nleast, he was forced to admit, was no match for hers.  She came, she\nwent without being seen–and behind her remained, instead of clews\nto her identity, only an amazing, intangible mystery, that left him\nat times appalled and dismayed.  How did she know about those\nconditions in West Broadway, how did she know about Metzer’s murder,\nhow did she know about Markel and Wilbur–how did she know about a\nhundred other affairs of the same sort that had happened since that\nnight, years ago now, when out of pure adventure he had tampered\nwith Marx’s, the jeweller’s strong room in Maiden Lane, and she had,\nmysteriously then, too, solved HIS identity, discovered him to be\nthe Gray Seal?",
        "Jimmie Dale, wrapped up in his own thoughts, entirely oblivious to\nhis surroundings, traversed another block.  There had never been\nsince the world began, and there would never be again, so singular\nand bizarre a partnership as this–of hers and his.  He, Jimmie\nDale, with his strange double life, one of New York’s young bachelor\nmillionaires, one whose social status was unquestioned; and she,\nwho–who WHAT?  That was just it!  Who what?  What was she?  What\nwas her name?  What one personal, intimate thing did he know about\nher?  And what was to be the end?  Not that he would have severed\nhis association with her–not for worlds!–though every time, that,\nby some new and curious method, one of her letters found its way\ninto his hands, outlining some fresh coup for him to execute, his\nperil and danger of discovery was increased in staggering ratio.\nTo-day, the police hunted the Gray Seal as they hunted a mad dog;\nthe papers stormed and raved against him: in every detective bureau\nof two continents he was catalogued as the most notorious criminal\nof the age–and yet, strange paradox, no single crime had ever been\ncommitted!",
        "Jimmie Dale’s strong, fine-featured face lighted up.  Crime!  Thanks\nto her, there were those who blessed the name of the Gray Seal,\nthose into whose lives had come joy, relief from misery, escape from\ndeath even–and their blessings were worth a thousandfold the risk\nand peril of disaster that threatened him at every minute of the\nday.",
        "“Thank God for her!” murmured Jimmie Dale softly.  “But–but if I\ncould only find her, see her, know who she is, talk to her, and hear\nher voice!”  Then he smiled a little wanly.  “It’s been a pretty\ntough month–and nothing to show for it!”",
        "It had!  It had been one of the hardest months through which Jimmie\nDale had ever lived.  The St. James, that most exclusive club, his\nfavourite haunt, had seen nothing of him; the easel in his den, that\nwas his hobby, had been untouched; there had been days even when he\nhad not crossed the threshold of his home.  Every resource at his\ncommand he had called into play in an effort to solve the mystery.\nFor nearly the entire month, following first this lead and then\nthat, he had lived in the one disguise that he felt confident she\nknew nothing of–that was, or, rather, had become, almost a dual\npersonality with him.  From the Sanctuary, that miserable and\ndisreputable room in a tenement on the East Side, a tenement that\nhad three separate means of entrance and exit, he had emerged day\nafter day as Larry the Bat, a character as well known and as well\nliked in the exclusive circles of the underworld as was Jimmie Dale\nin the most exclusive strata of New York’s society and fashion.  And\nit had been useless–all useless.  Through his own endeavours,\nthrough the help of his friends of the underworld, the lives of half\na dozen men, Bert Hagan’s on West Broadway, for instance, Markel’s,\nand others’, had been laid bare to the last shred, but nowhere could\nbe found the one vital point that linked their lives with hers, that\nwould account for her intimate knowledge of them, and so furnish him\nwith the clew that would then with certainty lead him to a solution\nof her identity.",
        "It was baffling, puzzling, unbelievable, bordering, indeed, on the\nmiraculous–herself, everything about her, her acts, her methods,\nher cleverness, intangible in one sense, were terrifically real in\nanother.  Jimmie Dale shook his head.  The miraculous and this\npractical, everyday life were wide and far apart.  There was nothing\nmiraculous about it–it was only that the key to it was, so far,\nbeyond his reach.",
        "And then suddenly Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders in consonance\nwith a whimsical change in both mood and thought.",
        "“Larry the Bat, is a hard taskmaster!” he muttered facetiously.\n“I’m afraid I’m not very presentable this evening–no bath this\nmorning, and no shave, and, after nearly a month of make-up, that\nbeastly grease paint gets into the skin creases in a most intimate\nway.”  He chuckled as the thought of old Jason, his butler, came to\nhim.  “I saw Jason, torn between two conflicting emotions, shaking\nhis head over the black circles under my eyes last night–he didn’t\nknow whether to worry over the first signs of a galloping decline,\nor break his heart at witnessing the young master he had dandled on\nhis knees going to the damnation bowwows and turning into a\nconfirmed roue!  I guess I’ll have to mind myself, though.  Even\nCarruthers detached his mind far enough from his editorial desk and\nthe hope of exclusively publishing the news of the Gray Seal’s\ncapture in the MORNING NEWS-ARGUS, to tell me I was looking seedy.\nIt’s wonderful the way a little paint will metamorphose a man!\nWell, anyway, here’s for a good hot tub to-night, and a fresh start!",
        "He quickened his pace.  There were still three blocks to go, and\nhere was no hurrying, jostling crowd to impede his progress; indeed,\nas far as he could see up the Drive, there was not a pedestrian in\nsight.  And then, as he walked, involuntarily, insistently, his mind\nharked back into the old groove again.",
        "“I’ve tried to picture her,” said Jimmie Dale softly to himself.\n“I’ve tried to picture her a hundred, yes, a thousand times, and–”",
        "A bus, rumbling cityward, went by him, squeaking, creaking, and\nrattling in its uneasy joints–and out of the noise, almost at his\nelbow it seemed, a voice spoke his name–and in that instant\nintuitively he KNEW, and it thrilled him, stopped the beat of his\nheart, as, dulcet, soft, clear as the note of a silver bell it fell–\nand only one word:",
        "“Jimmie!”",
        "He whirled around.  A limousine, wheels just grazing the curb, was\ngliding slowly and silently past him, and from the window a woman’s\narm, white-gloved and dainty, was extended, and from the fingers to\nthe pavement fluttered an envelope–and the car leaped forward.",
        "For the fraction of a second, Jimmie Dale stood dazed, immovable, a\ngamut of emotions, surprise, fierce exultation, amazement, a strange\njoy, a mighty uplift, swirling upon him–and then, snatching up the\nenvelope from the ground, he sprang out into the road after the car.\nIt was the one chance he had ever had, the one chance she had ever\ngiven him, and he had seen–a white-gloved arm!  He could not reach\nthe car, it was speeding away from him like an arrow now, but there\nwas something else that would do just as well, something that with\nall her cleverness she had overlooked–the car’s number dangling on\nthe rear axle, the rays of the little lamp playing on the enamelled\nsurface of the plate!  Gasping, panting, he held his own for a yard\nor more, and there floated back to him a little silvery laugh from\nthe body of the limousine, and then Jimmie Dale laughed, too, and\nstopped–it was No.15,836!",
        "He stood and watched the car disappear up the Drive.  What delicious\nirony!  A month of gruelling, ceaseless toil that had been vain,\nfutile, useless–and the key, when he was not looking for it,\nunexpectedly, through no effort of his, was thrust into his hand–\nNo.15,836!",
        "Jimmie Dale, the gently ironic smile still on his lips, those slim,\nsupersensitive fingers of his subconsciously noting that the texture\nof the envelope was the same as she always used, retraced his steps\nto the sidewalk.",
        "“Number fifteen thousand eight hundred and thirty-six,” said Jimmie\nDale aloud–and halted at the curb as though rooted to the spot.  It\nsounded strangely familiar, that number!  He repeated it over again\nslowly: “One-five-eight-three-six.”  And the smile left his lips,\nand upon his face came the look of a chastened child.  She had used\na duplicate plate!  Fifteen thousand eight hundred and thirty-six\nwas the number of one of his own cars–his own particular runabout!",
        "For a moment longer he stood there, undecided whether to laugh or\nswear, and then his eyes fastened mechanically on the envelope he\nwas twirling in his fingers.  Here, at least, was something that was\nnot elusive; that, on the contrary, as a hundred others in the past\nhad done, outlined probably a grim night’s work ahead for the Gray\nSeal!  And, if it were as those others had been, every minute from\nthe moment of its receipt was precious time.  He stepped under the\nnearest street light, and tore the envelope open.",
        "“Dear Philanthropic Crook,” it began–and then followed two closely\nwritten pages.  Jimmie Dale read them, his lips growing gradually\ntighter, a smouldering light creeping into his dark eyes, and once\nhe emitted a short, low whistle of consternation–that was at the\nend, as he read the post-script that was heavily underscored: “Work\nquickly.  They will raid to-night.  Be careful.  Look out for Kline,\nhe is the sharpest man in the United States secret service.”",
        "For a brief instant longer, Jimmie Dale stood under the street lamp,\nhis mind in a lightning-quick way cataloguing every point in her\nletter, viewing every point from a myriad angles, constructing,\ndevising, mapping out a plan to dove-tail into them–and then Jimmie\nDale swung on a downtown bus.  There was neither time nor occasion\nto go home now–that marvellous little kit of burglar’s tools that\npeeped from their tiny pockets in that curious leather undervest,\nand that reposed now in the safe in his den, would be useless to him\nto-night; besides, in the breast pocket of his coat, neatly folded,\nwas a black silk mask, and, relics of his role of Larry the Bat, an\nautomatic revolver, an electric flashlight, a steel jimmy, and a\nbunch of skeleton keys, were distributed among the other pockets of\nhis smart tweed suit.",
        "Jimmie Dale changed from the bus to the subway, leaving behind him,\nstrewn over many blocks, the tiny and minute fragments into which he\nhad torn her letter; at Astor Place he left the subway, walked to\nBroadway, turned uptown for a block to Eighth Street, then along\nEighth Street almost to Sixth Avenue–and stopped.",
        "A rather shabby shop, a pitiful sort of a place, displaying in its\nwindow a heterogeneous conglomeration of cheap odds and ends, ink\nbottles, candy, pencils, cigarettes, pens, toys, writing pads,\nmarbles, and a multitude of other small wares, confronted him.\nWithin, a little, old, sweet-faced, gray-haired woman stood behind\nthe counter, pottering over the rearrangement of some articles on\nthe shelves.",
        "“My word!” said Jimmie Dale softly to himself.  “You wouldn’t\nbelieve it, would you!  And I’ve always wondered how these little\nstores managed to make both ends meet.  Think of that old soul\nmaking fifteen or twenty thousand dollars from a layout like this–\neven if it has taken her a lifetime!”",
        "Jimmie Dale had halted nonchalantly and unconcernedly by the curb,\nnot too near the window, busied apparently in an effort to light a\nrefractory cigarette; and then, about to enter the store, he gazed\naimlessly across the street for a moment instead.  A man came\nbriskly around the corner from Sixth Avenue, opened the store door,\nand went in.",
        "Jimmie Dale drew back a little, and turned his head again as the\ndoor closed–and a sudden, quick, alert, and startled look spread\nover his face.",
        "The man who had entered bent over the counter and spoke to the old\nlady.  She seemed to listen with a dawning terror creeping over her\nfeatures, and then her hands went piteously to the thin hair behind\nher ears.  The man motioned toward a door at the rear of the store.\nShe hesitated, then came out from behind the counter, and swayed a\nlittle as though her limbs would not support her weight.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s lips thinned.",
        "“I’m afraid,” he muttered slowly, “I’m afraid that I’m too late even\nnow.”  And then, as she came to the door and turned the key on the\ninside: “Pray Heaven she doesn’t turn the light out–or somebody\nmight think I was trying to break in!”",
        "But in that respect Jimmie Dale’s fears were groundless.  She did\nnot turn out either of the gas jets that lighted the little shop;\ninstead, in a faltering, reluctant sort of manner, she led the way\ndirectly through the door in the rear, and the man followed her.",
        "The shop was empty–and Jimmie Dale was standing against the door on\nthe outside.  His position was perfectly natural–a hundred passers-\nby would have noted nothing but a most commonplace occurrence–a man\nin the act of entering a store.  And, if he appeared to fumble and\nhave trouble with the latch, what of it!  Jimmie Dale, however, was\nnot fumbling–hidden by his back that was turned to the street,\nthose wonderful fingers of his, in whose tips seemed embodied and\nconcentrated every one of the human senses, were working quickly,\nsurely, accurately, without so much as the wasted movement of a\nsingle muscle.",
        "A faint tinkle–and the key within fell from the lock to the floor.\nA faint click–and the bolt of the lock slipped back.  Jimmie Dale\nrestored the skeleton keys and a little steel instrument that\naccompanied them to his pocket–and quietly opened the door.  He\nstepped inside, picked up the key from the floor, inserted it in the\nlock, closed the door behind him, and locked it again.",
        "“To guard against interruption,” observed Jimmie Dale, a little\nquizzically.",
        "He was, perhaps, thirty seconds behind the others.  He crossed the\nshop noiselessly, cautiously, and passed through the door at the\nrear.  It opened into a short passage that, after a few feet, gave\non a sort of corridor at right angles–and down this latter, facing\nhim, at the end, the door of a lighted room was open, and he could\nsee the figure of the man who had entered the shop, back turned,\nstanding on the threshold.  Voices, indistinct, came to him.",
        "The corridor itself was dark; and Jimmie Dale, satisfied that he was\nfairly safe from observation, stole softly forward.  He passed two\ndoors on his left–and the curious arrangement of the building that\nhad puzzled him for a moment became clear.  The store made the front\nof an old tenement building, with apartments above, and the rear of\nthe store was a sort of apartment, too–the old lady’s living\nquarters.",
        "Step by step, testing each one against a possible creaking of the\nfloor, Jimmie Dale moved forward, keeping close up against one wall.\nThe man passed on into the room–and now Jimmie Dale could\ndistinguish every word that was being spoken; and, crouched up, in\nthe dark corridor, in the angle of the wall and the door jamb\nitself, could see plainly enough into the room beyond.  Jimmie\nDale’s jaw crept out a little.",
        "A young man, gaunt, pale, wrapped in blankets, half sat, half\nreclined in an invalid’s chair; the old lady, on her knees, the\ntears streaming down her face, had her arms around the sick man’s\nneck; while the other man, apparently upset at the scene, tugged\nvigorously at long, gray mustaches.",
        "“Sammy!  Sammy!” sobbed the woman piteously.  “Say you didn’t do it,\nSammy–say you didn’t do it!”",
        "Look here, Mrs. Matthews,” said the man with the gray mustaches\ngently, “now don’t you go to making things any harder.  I’ve got to\ndo my duty just the same, and take your son.”",
        "The young man, a hectic flush beginning to burn on his cheeks, gazed\nwildly from one to the other.",
        "“What–what is it?” he cried out.",
        "The man threw back his coat and displayed a badge on his vest.",
        "“I’m Kline of the secret service,” he said gravely.  “I’m sorry,\nSammy, but I want you for that little job in Washington at the\nbureau–before you left on sick leave!”",
        "Sammy Matthews struggled away from his mother’s arms, pulled himself\nforward in his chair–and his tongue licked dry lips.",
        "“What–what job?” he whispered thickly.",
        "“You know, don’t you?” the other answered steadily.  He took a\nlarge, flat pocketbook from his pocket, opened it, and took out a\nfive-dollar bill.  He held this before the sick man’s eyes, but just\nout of reach, one finger silently indicating the lower left-hand\ncorner.",
        "Matthews stared at it for a moment, and the hectic flush faded to a\ngrayish pallor, and a queer, impotent sound gurgled in his throat.",
        "“I see you recognise it,” said the other quietly.  “It’s open and\nshut, Sammy.  That little imperfection in the plate’s got you, my\nboy.”",
        "“Sammy!  Sammy!” sobbed the woman again.  “Sammy, say you didn’t do\nit!”",
        "“It’s a lie!” said Matthews hoarsely.  “It’s a lie!  That plate was\ncondemned in the bureau for that imperfection–condemned and\ndestroyed.”",
        "“Condemned TO BE destroyed,” corrected the other, without raising\nhis voice.  “There’s a little difference there, Sammy–about twenty\nyears’ difference–in the Federal pen.  But it wasn’t destroyed;\nthis note was printed from it by one of the slickest gangs of\ncounterfeiters in the United States–but I don’t need to tell you\nthat, I guess you know who they are.  I’ve been after them a long\ntime, and I’ve got them now, just as tight as I’ve got you.  Instead\nof destroying that plate, you stole it, and disposed of it to the\ngang.  How much did they give you?”",
        "Matthews’ face seemed to hold a dumb horror, and his fingers picked\nat the arms of the chair.  His mother had moved from beside him now,\nand both her hands were patting at the man’s sleeve in a pitiful\nway, while again and again she tried to speak, but no words would\ncome.",
        "“It’s a lie!” said Matthews again, in a colourless, mechanical way.",
        "The man glanced at Mrs. Matthews as he put the five-dollar note back\ninto his pocket, seemed to choke a little, shook his head, and all\ntrace of the official sternness that had crept into his voice\ndisappeared.",
        "“It’s no good,” he said in a low tone.  “Don’t do that, Mrs.\nMatthews, I’ve got to do my duty.”  He leaned a little toward the\nchair.  “It’s dead to rights, Sammy.  You might as well make a clean\nbreast of it.  It was up to you and Al Gregor to see that the plate\nwas destroyed.  It WASN’T destroyed; instead, it shows up in the\nhands of a gang of counterfeiters that I’ve been watching for\nmonths.  Furthermore, I’ve got the plate itself.  And finally,\nthough I haven’t placed him under arrest yet for fear you might hear\nof it before I wanted you to and make a get-away, I’ve got Al Gregor\nwhere I can put my hands on him, and I’ve got his confession that\nyou and he worked the game between you to get that plate out of the\nbureau and dispose of it to the gang.”",
        "“Oh, my God!\"–it came in a wild cry from the sick man, and in a\ndesperate, lurching way he struggled up to his feet.  “Al Gregor\nsaid that?  Then–then I’m done!”  He clutched at his temples.  “But\nit’s not true–it’s not true!  If the plate was stolen, and it must\nhave been stolen, or that note wouldn’t have been found, it was Al\nGregor who stole it–I didn’t, I tell you!  I knew nothing of it,\nexcept that he and I were responsible for it and–and I left it to\nhim–that’s the only way I’m to blame.  He’s caught, and he’s trying\nto get out of it with a light sentence by pretending to turn State’s\nevidence, but–but I’ll fight him–he can’t prove it–it’s only his\nword against mine, and–”",
        "The other shook his head again.",
        "“It’s no good, Sammy,” he said, a touch of sternness back in his\ntones again.  “I told you it was open and shut.  It’s not only Al\nGregor.  One of the gang got weak knees when I got him where I\nwanted him the other night, and he swears that you are the one who\nDELIVERED the plate to them.  Between him and Gregor and what I know\nmyself, I’ve got evidence enough for any jury against every one of\nthe rest of you.”",
        "Horror, fear, helplessness seemed to mingle in the sick man’s\nstaring eyes, and he swayed unsteadily upon his feet.",
        "“I’m innocent!” he screamed out.  “But I’m caught, I’m caught in a\nnet, and I can’t get out–they lied to you–but no one will believe\nit any more than you do and–and it means twenty years for me–oh,\nGod!–twenty years,  and–”  His hands went wriggling to his temples\nagain, and he toppled back in a faint into the chair.",
        "“You’ve killed him!  You’ve killed my boy!” the old lady shrieked\nout piteously, and flung herself toward the senseless figure.",
        "The man jumped for the table across the room, on which was a row of\nbottles, snatched one up, drew the cork, smelled it, and ran back\nwith the bottle.  He poured a little of the contents into his cupped\nhand, held it under young Matthews’ nostrils, and pushed the bottle\ninto Mrs. Matthews’ hands.",
        "“Bathe his forehead with this, Mrs. Matthews,” he directed\nreassuringly.  “He’ll be all right again in a moment.  There, see–\nhe’s coming around now.”",
        "There was a long, fluttering sigh, and Matthews opened his eyes;\nthen a moment’s silence; and then he spoke, with an effort, with\nlong pauses between the words:",
        "“Am–I–to–go–now?”",
        "The words seemed to ring absolute terror in the old lady’s ears.\nShe turned, and dropped to her knees on the floor.",
        "“Mr. Kline, Mr. Kline,” she sobbed out, “oh, for God’s love, don’t\ntake him!  Let him off, let him go!  He’s my boy–all I’ve got!\nYou’ve got a mother, haven’t you?  You know–”  The tears were\nstreaming down the sweet, old face again.  “Oh, won’t you, for God’s\ndear name, won’t you let him go?  Won’t–”",
        "“Stop!” the man cried huskily.  He was mopping at his face with his\nhandkerchief.  “I thought I was case-hardened, I ought to be–but I\nguess I’m not.  But I’ve got to do my duty.  You’re only making it\nworse for Sammy there, as well as me.”",
        "Her arms were around his knees now, clinging there.",
        "“Why can’t you let him off!” she pleaded hysterically.  “Why can’t\nyou!  Why can’t you!  Nobody would know, and I’d do anything–I’d\npay anything–anything–I’ll give you ten–fifteen thousand\ndollars!”",
        "“My poor woman,” he said kindly, placing his hand on her head, “you\nare talking wildly.  Apart altogether from the question of duty,\neven if I succeeded in hushing the matter up, I would probably at\nleast be suspected and certainly discharged, and I have a family to\nsupport–and if I were caught I’d get ten years in the Federal\nprison for it.  I’m sorry for this; I believe it’s your boy’s first\noffence, and if I could let him off I would.”",
        "“But you can–you can!” she burst out, rocking on her knees,\nclinging tighter still to him, as though in a paroxysm of fear that\nhe might somehow elude her.  “It will kill him–it will kill my boy.\nAnd you can save him!  And even if they discharged you, what would\nthat mean against my boy’s life!  You wouldn’t suffer, your family\nwouldn’t suffer, I’ll–I’ll take care of that–perhaps I could raise\na little more than fifteen thousand–but, oh, have pity, have mercy–\ndon’t take him away!”",
        "The man stared at her a moment, stared at the white face on the\nreclining chair–and passed his hand heavily across his eyes.",
        "“You will!  You will!”  It came in a great surging cry of joy from\nthe old lady.  “You will–oh, thank God, thank God!–I can see it in\nyour face!”",
        "“I–I guess I’m soft,” he said huskily, and stooped and raised Mrs.\nMatthews to her feet.  “Don’t cry any more.  It’ll be all right–\nit’ll be all right.  I’ll–I’ll fix it up somehow.  I haven’t made\nany arrests yet, and–well, I’ll take my chances.  I’ll get the\nplate and turn it over to you to-morrow, only–only it’s got to be\ndestroyed in my presence.”",
        "“Yes, yes!” she cried, trying to smile through her tears–and then\nshe flung her arms around her son’s neck again.  “And when you come\nto-morrow, I’ll be ready with the money to do my share, too, and–”",
        "But Sammy Matthews shook his head.",
        "“You’re wrong, both of you,” he said weakly.  “You’re a white man,\nKline.  But destroying that plate won’t save me.  The minute a\nsingle note printed from it shows up, they’ll know back there in\nWashington that the plate was stolen, and–”",
        "“No; you’re safe enough there,” the other interposed heavily.\n“Knowing what was up, you don’t think I’d give the gang a chance to\nget them into circulation, do you?  I got them all when I got the\nplate.  And\"–he smiled a little anxiously–\"I’ll bring them here to\nbe destroyed with the plate.  It would finish me now, as well as\nyou, if one of them ever showed up.  Say,” he said suddenly, with a\ncatch in his breath, “I–I don’t think I know what I’m doing.”",
        "Mrs. Matthews reached out her hands to him.",
        "“What can I say to you!” she said brokenly, “What–”",
        "Jimmie Dale drew back along the wall.  A little way from the door he\nquickened his pace, still moving, however, with extreme caution.\nThey were still talking behind him as he turned from the corridor\ninto the passageway leading to the store, and from there into the\nstore itself.  And then suddenly, in spite of caution, his foot\nslipped on the bare floor.  It was not much–just enough to cause\nhis other foot, poised tentatively in air, to come heavily down, and\na loud and complaining creak echoed from the floor.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s jaws snapped like a steel trap.  From down the\ncorridor came a sudden, excited exclamation in the little old lady’s\nvoice, and then her steps sounded running toward the store.  In the\nfraction of a second Jimmie Dale was at the front door.",
        "“Clumsy, blundering fool!” he whispered fiercely to himself as he\nturned the key, opened the door noiselessly until it was just ajar,\nand turned the key in the lock again, leaving the bolt protruding\nout.  One step backward, and he was rapping on the counter with his\nknuckles.  “Isn’t anybody here?” he called out loudly.  “Isn’t any–\noh!\"–as Mrs. Matthews appeared in the back doorway.  “A package of\ncigarettes, please.”",
        "She stared at him, a little frightened, her eyes red and swollen\nwith recent crying.",
        "“How–how did you get in here?” she asked tremendously.",
        "“I beg your pardon?” inquired Jimmie Dale, in polite surprise.",
        "“I–I locked the door–I’m sure I did,” she said, more to herself\nthan to Jimmie Dale, and hurried across the floor to the door as she\nspoke.",
        "Jimmie Dale, still politely curious, turned to watch her.  For a\nmoment bewilderment and a puzzled look were in her face–and then a\nsort of surprised relief.",
        "“I must have turned the key in the lock without shutting the door\ntight,” she explained, “for I knew I turned the key.”",
        "Jimmie Dale bent forward to examine the lock–and nodded.",
        "“Yes,” he agreed, with a smile.  “I should say so.”  Then, gravely\ncourteous: “I’m sorry to have intruded.”",
        "“It is nothing,” she answered; and, evidently anxious to be rid of\nhim, moved quickly around behind the counter.  “What kind of\ncigarettes do you want?”",
        "“Egyptians–any kind,” said Jimmie Dale, laying a bill on the\ncounter.",
        "He pocketed the cigarettes and his change, and turned to the door.",
        "“Good-evening,” he said pleasantly–and went out.",
        "Jimmie Dale smiled a little curiously, a little tolerantly.  As he\nstarted along the street, he heard the door of the little shop close\nwith a sort of supercareful bang, the key turned, and the latch\nrattle to try the door–the little old lady was bent on making no\nmistake a second time!",
        "And then the smile left Jimmie Dale’s lips, his face grew strained\nand serious, and he broke into a run down the block to Sixth Avenue.\nHere he paused for an instant–there was the elevated, the surface\ncars–which would be the quicker?  He looked up the avenue.  There\nwas no train coming; the nearest surface car was blocks away.  He\nbit his lips in vexation–and then with a jump he was across the\nstreet and hailing a passing taxicab that his eyes had just lighted\non.",
        "“Got a fare?” called Jimmie Dale.",
        "“No, sir,” answered the chauffeur, bumping his car to an abrupt\nhalt.",
        "“Good!” Jimmie Dale ran alongside, and yanked the door open.  “Do\nyou know where the Palace Saloon on the Bowery is?”",
        "“Yes, sir,” replied the man.",
        "Jimmie Dale held a ten-dollar bank note up before the chauffeur’s\neyes.",
        "“Earn that in four minutes, then,” he snapped–and sprang into the\ncab.",
        "The taxicab swerved around on little better than two wheels, started\non a mad dash down the Avenue–and Jimmie Dale braced himself grimly\nin his seat.  The cab swerved again, tore across Waverly Place,\ncircuited Washington Square, crossed Broadway, and whirled finally\ninto the upper end of the Bowery.",
        "Jimmie Dale spoke once–to himself–plaintively.",
        "“It’s too bad I can’t let old Carruthers in on this for a scoop with\nhis precious MORNING NEWS-ARGUS–but if I get out of it alive\nmyself, I’ll do well!  Wonder if the day’ll ever come when he finds\nout that his very dear friend and old college pal, Jimmie Dale, is\nthe Gray Seal that he’s turned himself inside out for about four\nyears now to catch, and that he’d trade his soul with the devil any\ntime to lay hands on!  Good old Carruthers!  ’The most puzzling,\nbewildering, delightful crook in the annals of crime’–am I?”",
        "The cab drew up at the curb.  Jimmie Dale sprang out, shoved the\nbill into the chauffeur’s hand, stepped quickly across the sidewalk,\nand pushed his way through the swinging doors of the Palace Saloon.\nInside leisurely and nonchalantly, he walked down past the length of\nthe bar to a door at the rear.  This opened into a passageway that\nled to the side entrance of the saloon on the cross street.  Jimmie\nDale emerged from the side entrance, crossed the street, retraced\nhis steps to the Bowery, crossed over, and walked rapidly down that\nthoroughfare for two blocks.  Here he turned east into the cross\nstreet; and here, once more, his pace became leisurely and\nunhurried.",
        "“It’s a strange coincidence, though possibly a very happy one,” said\nJimmie Dale, as he walked along, “that it should be on the same\nstreet as the Sanctuary–ah, this ought to be the place!”",
        "An alleyway, corresponding to the one that flanked the tenement\nwhere, as Larry the Bat, he had paid room rent as a tenant for\nseveral years, in fact, the alleyway next above it, and but a short\nblock away, intersected the street, narrow, black, and uninviting.\nJimmie Dale, as he passed, peered down its length.",
        "“No light–that’s good!” commented Jimmie Dale to himself.  Then:\n“Window opens on alleyway ten feet from ground–shoe store, Russian\nJew, in basement–go in front door–straight hallway–room at end–\nRussian Jew probably accomplice–be careful that he does not hear\nyou moving overhead\"–Jimmie Dale’s mind, with that curious faculty\nof his, was subconsciously repeating snatches from her letter word\nfor word, even as he noted the dimly lighted, untidy, and disorderly\ninterior of what, from strings of leather slippers that decorated\nthe cellarlike entrance, was evidently a cheap and shoddy shoe store\nin the basement of the building.",
        "The building itself was rickety and tumble-down, three stories high,\nand given over undoubtedly to gregarious foreigners of the poorer\nclass, a rabbit burrow, as it were, having a multitude of roomers\nand lodgers.  There was nothing ominous or even secretive about it–\nup the short flight of steps to the entrance, even the door hung\ncarelessly half open.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s slouch hat was pulled a little farther down over his\neyes as he mounted the steps and entered the hallway.  He listened a\nmoment.  A sort of subdued, querulous hubbub seemed to hum through\nthe place, as voices, men’s, women’s, and children’s, echoing out\nfrom their various rooms above, mingled together, and floated down\nthe stairways in a discordant medley.  Jimmie Dale stepped lightly\ndown the length of the hall–and listened again; this time intently,\nwith his ear to the keyhole of the door that made the end of the\npassage.  There was not a sound from within.  He tried the door,\nsmiled a little as he reached for his keys, worked over the lock–\nand straightened up suddenly as his ear caught a descending step on\nthe stairs.  It was two flights up, however–and the door was\nunlocked now.  Jimmie Dale opened it, and, like a shadow, slipped\ninside; and, as he locked the door behind him, smiled once more–the\ndoor lock was but a paltry makeshift at best, but INSIDE his fingers\nhad touched a massive steel bolt that, when shot home, would yield\nwhen the door itself yielded–and not before.  Without moving the\nbolt, he turned–and his flashlight for a moment swept the room.",
        "“Not much like the way they describe this sort of place in\nstorybooks!” murmured Jimmie Dale capriciously.  “But I get the\nidea.  Mr. Russian Jew downstairs makes a bluff at using it for a\nstoreroom.”",
        "Again the flashlight made a circuit.  Here, there, and everywhere,\nseemingly without any attempt at order, were piles of wooden\nshipping cases.  Only the centre of the room was clear and empty;\nthat, and a vacant space against the wall by the window.",
        "Jimmie Dale, moving without sound, went to the window.  There was a\nshade on it, and it was pulled down.  He reached up underneath it,\nfelt for the window fastening, and unlocked it; then cautiously\ntested the window itself by lifting it an inch or two–it slid\neasily in its grooves.",
        "He stood then for a moment, hardfaced, a frown gathering his\nforehead into heavy furrows, as the flashlight’s ray again and again\ndarted hither and thither.  There was nothing, absolutely nothing in\nthe room but wooden packing cases.  He lifted the cover of the one\nnearest to him and looked inside.  It was quite empty, except for\nsome pieces of heavy cord, and a few cardboard shoe boxes that, in\nturn, were empty, too.",
        "“It’s here, of course,” said Jimmie Dale thoughtfully to himself.\n“Clever work, too!  But I can’t move half a hundred packing cases\nwithout that chap below hearing me; and I can’t do it in ten\nminutes, either, which, I imagine is the outside limit of time.\nFortunately, though, these cases are not without their compensation–\na dozen men could hide here.”",
        "He began to move about the room.  And now he stooped before one pile\nof boxes and then another, curiously attempting to lift up the\nentire pile from the bottom.  Some he could not move; others, by\nexerting all his strength, gave a little; and then, finally, over in\none corner, he found a pile that appeared to answer his purpose.",
        "“These are certainly empty,” he muttered.",
        "There was just room to squeeze through between them and the next\nstack of cases alongside; but, once through, by the simple expedient\nof moving the cases out a little to take advantage of the angle made\nby the corner of the room, he obtained ample space to stand\ncomfortably upright against the wall.  But Jimmie Dale was not\nsatisfied yet.  Could he see out into the room?  He experimented\nwith his flashlight–and carefully shifted the screen of cases\nbefore him a little to one side.  And yet still he was not\nsatisfied.  With a sort of ironical droop at the corners of his\nlips, as though suddenly there had flashed upon him the inspiration\nthat fathered one of those whimsical ideas and fancies that were so\nessentially a characteristic of Jimmie Dale, he came out from behind\nthe cases, went across the room to the case he had opened when he\nfirst entered, took out the cord and the cover of one of the\ncardboard shoe boxes, and with these returned to his hiding place\nonce more.",
        "The sounds from the upper stories of the tenement now reached him\nhardly at all; but from below, directly under his feet almost, he\ncould hear some one, the proprietor of the shoe store probably,\nwalking about.",
        "Tense, every faculty now on the alert, his head turned in a\nstrained, attentive attitude, Jimmie Dale threw on the flashlight’s\ntiny switch, took that intimate and thin metal case from his pocket,\nextracted a diamond-shaped, gray paper seal with the little\ntweezers, moistened the adhesive side, and stuck it in the centre of\nthe white cardboard-box cover, then tore the edges of the cardboard\ndown until the whole was just small enough to slip into his pocket.\nThrough the cardboard he looped a piece of cord, placard fashion,\nand with his pencil printed the four words–\"with the compliments of\n“–above the gray seal.  He surveyed the result with a grim,\nmirthless chuckle–and put the piece of cardboard in his pocket.",
        "“I’m taking the longest chances I ever took in my life,” said Jimmie\nDale very seriously to himself, as his fingers twisted, and doubled,\nand tied the remaining pieces of cord together, and finally\nfashioned a running noose in one end.  “I don’t–”  The cord and the\nflashlight went into his pocket, the room was in darkness, the black\nmask was whipped from his breast pocket and adjusted to his face,\nand his automatic was in his hand.",
        "Came the creak of a footstep, as though on a ladder exactly below\nhim, another, and another, receding curiously in its direction, yet\nat the same time growing louder in sound as if nearer the floor–\nthen a crack of light showed in the floor in the centre of the room.\nThis held for an instant, then expanded suddenly into a great\nluminous square–and through a trapdoor, opened wide now, a man’s\nhead appeared.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes, fixed through the space between the piles of\ncases, narrowed–there was, indeed, little doubt but that the shoe-\nstore proprietor below was an accomplice!  The store served a most\nconvenient purpose in every respect–as a secret means of entry into\nthe room, as a sort of guarantee of innocence for the room itself.\nWhy not!  To the superficial observer, to the man who might by some\nchance blunder into the room–it was but an adjunct of the store\nitself!",
        "The man in the trap-doorway paused with his shoulders above the\nfloor, looked around, listened, then drew himself up, walked across\nthe floor, and shot the heavy bolt on the door that led into the\nhallway of the house.  He returned then to the trapdoor, bent over\nit, and whistled softly.  Two more men, in answer to the summons,\ncame up into the room.",
        "“The Cap’ll be along in a minute,” one of them said.  “Turn on the\nlight.”",
        "A switch clicked, flooding the room with sudden brilliancy from half\na dozen electric bulbs.",
        "“Too many!” grunted the same voice again.  “We ain’t working to-\nnight–turn out half of ’em.”",
        "The sudden transition from the darkness for a moment dazzled Jimmie\nDale’s eyes–but the next moment he was searching the faces of the\nthree men.  There were few crooks, few denizens of the crime world\nbelow the now obsolete but still famous dead line that, as Larry the\nBat, he did not know at least by sight.",
        "“Moulton, Whitie Burns, and Marty Dean,” confided Jimmie Dale softly\nto himself.  “And I don’t know of any worse, except–the Cap.  And\ngun fighters, every one of them, too–nice odds, to say nothing of–”",
        "“Here’s the Cap now!” announced one of the three.  “Hello, Cap,\nwhere’d you raise the mustache?”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes shifted to the trapdoor, and into them crept a\ncontemptuous and sardonic smile–the man who was coming up now and\nhoisting himself to the floor was the man who, half an hour before,\nhad threatened young Sammy Matthews with arrest.",
        "The Cap, alias Bert Malone, alias a score of other names, closed the\ntrapdoor after him, pulled off his mustache and gray wig, tucked\nthem in his pocket, and faced his companions brusquely.",
        "“Never mind about the mustache,” he said curtly.  “Get busy, the lot\nof you.  Stir around and get the works out!”",
        "“What for?” inquired Whitie Burns, a sharp, ferret-faced little man.\n“We got enough of the old stuff on hand now, and that bum break\nGregor made when he pinched the cracked plate put the finish on\nthat.  Say, Cap–”",
        "“Close your face, Whitie, and get the works out!” Malone cut in\nshortly.  “We’ve only got the whole night ahead of us–but we’ll\nneed it all.  We’re going to run the queer off that cracked plate.”",
        "One of the others, Marty Dean this time, a certain brutal\naggressiveness in both features and physique, edged forward.",
        "“Say, what’s the lay?” he demanded.  “A joke?  We printed one fiver\noff that plate–and then we knew enough to quit.  With that crack\nalong the corner, you couldn’t pass ’em on a blind man!  And Gregor\nsaying he thought we could patch the plate up enough to get by with\ngives me a pain–he’s got jingles in his dome factory!  Run them\nfivers eh–say, are you cracked, too?”",
        "“Aw, forget it!” observed Malone caustically.  “Who’s running this\ngang?”  Then, with a malicious grin: “I got a customer for those\nfivers–fifteen thousand dollars for all we can turn out to-night.\nSee?”",
        "The others stared at him for a moment, incredulity and greed\nmingling in a curious half-hesitant, half-expectant look on their\nfaces.",
        "Then Whitie Burns spoke, circling his lips with the tip of his\ntongue:",
        "“D’ye mean it, Cap–honest?  What’s the lay?  How’d you work it?”",
        "Malone, unbending with the sensation he had created, grinned again.",
        "“Easy enough,” he said offhandedly.  It was like falling off a log.\nGregor said, didn’t he, that the only way he had been able to get\nhis claws on that plate was on account of young Matthews going away\nsick–eh?  Well, the old Matthews woman, his mother, has got money–\nabout fifteen thousand.  I guess she ain’t got any more than that,\nor I’d have raised the ante.  Aw, it was easy.  She threw it at me.\nI framed one up on them, that’s all.  I’m Kline, of the secret\nservice–see?  I don’t suppose they’d ever seen him, though they’d\nknow his name fast enough, but I made up something like him.  I\nshowed them where I had a case against Sammy for pinching the plate\nthat was strong enough to put a hundred innocent men behind the\nbars.  Of course, he knew well enough he was innocent, but he could\nsee the twenty years I showed him with both eyes.  Say, he mussed\nall over the place, and went and fainted like a girl.  And then the\nold woman came across with an offer of fifteen thousand for the\nplate, and corrupted me.”  Malone’s cunning, vicious face, now that\nthe softening effects of the gray hair and mustache were gone,\nseemed accentuated diabolically by the grin broadening into a laugh,\nas he guffawed.",
        "Marty Dean’s hand swung with a bang to Malone’s shoulder.",
        "“Say, Cap–say, you’re all right!” he exclaimed excitedly.  You’re\nthe boy!  But what’s the good of running anything off the plate\nbefore turning it over to ’em–the stuff’s no good to us.”",
        "“You got a wooden nut, with sawdust for brains,” said Malone\nsarcastically.  “If he’d thought the gang of counterfeiters that was\nsupposed to have bought the plate from him had run off only one\nfiver and then stopped because they say it wouldn’t get by, and\nweren’t going to run any more, and just destroy the plate like it\nwas supposed to have been destroyed to begin with, and it all end up\nwith no one the wiser, where d’ye think we’d have banked that\nfifteen thousand!  I told him I had the whole run confiscated, and\nthat the queer went with the plate, so we’ll just make that little\nrun to-night–that’s why I sent word around to you this morning.”",
        "“By the jumping!” ejaculated Whitie Burns, heavy with admiration.\n“You got a head on you, Cap!”",
        "“It’s a good thing for some of you that I have,” returned Malone\ncomplacently.  “But don’t stand jawing all night.  Go on, now–get\nbusy!”",
        "There was no surprise in Jimmie Dale’s face–he had chosen his\nposition behind a pile of cases that he had been extremely careful,\nas a man is careful when his life hangs in the balance, to assure\nhimself were empty.  None of the four came near or touched the pile\nbehind which he stood; but, here and there about the room, they\npulled this one and that one out from various stacks.  In scarcely\nmore than a moment, the room was completely transformed.  It was no\nlonger a storeroom for surplus stock, for the storage of bulky and\nempty packing cases!  From the cases the men had picked out, like a\ntouch of magic, appeared a veritable printing plant, an elaborate\nengraver’s outfit–a highly efficient foot-power press, rapidly\nbeing assembled by Whitie Burns; an electric dryer, inks, a pile of\nwhite, silk-threaded bank-note paper, a cutter, and a score of other\nappurtenances.",
        "“Yes,” said Jimmie Dale very gently to himself.  “Yes, quite so–but\nthe plate?  Ah!”  Malone was taking it out from the middle of a\nbundle of old newspapers, loosely tied together, that he had lifted\nfrom one of the cases.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes fastened on it–and from that instant never left\nit.  A minute passed, two, three of them–the four men were silently\nbusy about the room–Malone was carefully cleaning the plate.",
        "“They will raid to-night.  Look out for Kline, he is the sharpest\nman in the United State secret service\"–the warning in her letter\nwas running through Jimmie Dale’s mind.  Kline–the real Kline–was\ngoing to raid the place to-night.  When?  At what time?  It must be\nnearly eleven o’clock already, and–",
        "It came sudden, quick as the crack of doom–a terrific crash against\nthe bolted door–but the door, undoubtedly to the surprise of those\nwithout, held fast, thanks to the bolt.  The four men, white-faced,\nseemed for an instant turned to statues.  Came another crash against\nthe door–and a sharp, imperative order to those within to open it\nand surrender.",
        "“We’re pinched!  Beat it!” whispered Whitie Burns wildly–and dashed\nfor the trapdoor.",
        "Like a rat for its hole, Marty Dean followed.  Malone, farther away,\ndropped the plate on the floor, and rushed, with Moulton beside him,\nafter the others–but he never reached the trapdoor.",
        "Over the crashing blows, raining now in quick succession on the door\nof the room, over a startled commotion as lodgers, roomers, and\ntenants on the floor above awoke into frightened activity with\nshouts and cries, came the louder crash of a pile of packing boxes\nhurled to the floor.  And over them, vaulting those scattered in his\nway, Jimmie Dale sprang at Malone.  The man reeled back, with a\ncry.  Moulton dashed through the trapdoor and disappeared.  The\nshort, ugly barrel of Jimmie Dale’s automatic was between Malone’s\neyes.",
        "“You make a move,” said Jimmie Dale, in a low sibilant way, “and\nI’ll drop you where you stand!  Put your hands behind your back–\npalms together!”",
        "Malone, dazed, cowed, obeyed.  A panel of the door split and rent\ndown its length–the hinges were sagging.  Jimmie Dale worked like\nlightning.  The cord with the slip noose from his pocket went around\nMalone’s wrists, jerked tight, and knotted; the placard, his lips\ngrim, with no sign of humour, Jimmie Dale dangled around the man’s\nneck.",
        "“An introduction for you to Mr. Kline out there–that you seem so\nfond of!” gritted Jimmie Dale.  Then, working as he talked: “I’ve\ngot no time to tell you what I think of you, you pitiful hound\"–he\nsnatched up the plate from the floor and put it in his pocket–\"\nTwenty years, I think you said, didn’t you?\"–his hand shot into\nMalone’s pocket-book, and extracted the five-dollar note–”  If you\ncan open this with your toes maybe you can get a way\"–he wrenched\nthe trapdoor over and slammed it shut–\"good-night, Malone\"–and he\nleaped for the window.",
        "The door tottered inward from the top, ripping, tearing, smashing\nhinges, panels, and jamb.  Jimmie Dale got a blurred vision of brass\nbuttons, blue coats, and helmets, and, in the forefront, of a\nstocky, gray-mustached, gray-haired man in plain clothes.",
        "Jimmie Dale threw up the window, swung out, as with a rush the\nofficers burst through into the room and a revolver bullet hummed\nviciously past his ear, and dropped to the ground–into encircling\narms!",
        "“Ah, no, you don’t, my bucko!” snapped a hoarse voice in his ear.\n“Keep quiet now, or I’ll crack your bean–understand!”",
        "But the officer, too heavy to be muscular, was no match for Jimmie\nDale, who, even as he had dropped from the sill, had caught sight of\nthe lurking form below; and now, with a quick, sudden, lithe\nmovement he wriggled loose, his fist from a short-arm jab smashed\nupon the point of the other’s jaw, sending the man staggering\nbackward–and Jimmie Dale ran.",
        "A crowd was already collecting at the mouth of the alleyway, mostly\noccupants of the house itself, and into these, scattering them in\nall directions, eluding dexterously another officer who made a grab\nfor him, Jimmie Dale charged at top speed, burst through, and headed\ndown the street, running like a deer.",
        "Yells went up, a revolver spat venomously behind him, came the\nshrill CHEEP-CHEEP! of the police whistle, and heavy boots pounding\nthe pavement in pursuit.",
        "Down the block Jimmie Dale raced.  The yells augmented in his rear.\nAnother shot–and this time he heard the bullet buzz.  And then he\nswerved–into the next alleyway–that flanked the Sanctuary.",
        "He had perhaps a ten yards’ lead, just a little more than the\ndistance from the street to the side door of the Sanctuary that\nopened on the alleyway.  And, as he ran now, his fingers tore at his\nclothing, loosening his tie, unbuttoning coat, vest, collar, shirt,\nand undershirt.  He leaped at the door, swung it open, flung himself\ninside–and then sacrificing speed to silence, went up the stairs\nlike a cat, cramming his mask now into his pocket.",
        "His room was on the first landing.  In an instant he had unlocked\nthe door, entered, and locked it again behind him.  From outside, an\nexcited street urchin’s voice shrilled up to him:",
        "“He went in that door!  I seen him!”",
        "The police whistle chirped again; and then an authoritative voice:",
        "“Get around and watch the saloon back of this, Heeney–there’s a way\nout through there from this joint.”",
        "Jimmie Dale, divested of every stitch of clothing that he had worn,\npulled a disreputable collarless flannel shirt over his head, pulled\non a dirty and patched pair of trousers, and slipped into a\nthreadbare and filthy coat.  Jimmie Dale was working against\nseconds.  They were at the lower door now.  He lifted the oilcloth\nin the corner of the room, lifted up the loose piece of the\nflooring, shoved his discarded garments inside, and from a little\nbox that was there smeared the hollow of his hand with some black\nsubstance, possessed himself of two little articles, replaced the\nflooring, replaced the oilcloth, and, in bare feet, stole across the\nroom to the door.  Against the door, without a sound, Jimmie Dale\nplaced a chair, and on the chair seat he laid the two little\narticles he had been carrying in his hand.  It was intensely black\nin the room, but Jimmie Dale needed no light here.  From under the\nbed he pulled out a pair of woolen socks and a pair of congress\nboots, both as disreputable as the rest of his attire, put them on–\nand very quietly, softly, cautiously, stretched himself out on the\nbed.",
        "The officers were at the top of the stairs.  A voice barked out:",
        "“Stand guard on this landing, Peters.  Higgins, you take the one\nabove.  We’ll start from the top of the house and work down.  Allow\nno one to pass you.”",
        "“Yes, sir!  Very good, Mr. Kline,” was the response.",
        "Kline!–the sharpest man in the United States secret service, she\nhad said.  Jimmie Dale’s lips set.",
        "“I’m glad I had no shave this morning,” said Jimmie Dale grimly to\nhimself.",
        "His fingers were working with the black substance in the hollow of\nhis hand–and the long, slim, tapering fingers, the shapely, well-\ncared-for hands grew unkempt and grimy, black beneath the finger\nnails–and a little, too, played its part on the day’s growth of\nbeard, a little around the throat and at the nape of the neck, a\nlittle across the forehead to meet the locks of straggling and\ndisordered hair.  Jimmie Dale wiped the residue from the hollow of\nhis hand on the knee of his trousers–and lay still.",
        "An officer paced outside.  Upstairs doors opened and closed.  Gruff,\nharsh tones in commands echoed through the house.  The search party\ndescended to the second floor–and again the same sounds were\nrepeated.  And then, thumping down the creaking stairs, they stopped\nbefore Jimmie Dale’s room.  Some one tried the door, and, finding it\nlocked, rattled it violently.",
        "“Open the door!”  It was Kline’s voice,",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes were closed, and he was breathing regularly,\nthough just a little slower than in natural respiration.",
        "“Break it down!” ordered Kline tersely.",
        "There was a rush at it–and it gave.  It surged inward, knocked\nagainst the chair, upset the latter, something tinkled to the floor–\nand four officers, with Kline at their head, jumped into the room.",
        "Jimmie Dale never moved.  A flashlight played around the room and\nfocused upon him–and then he was shaken roughly–only to fall\ninertly back on the bed again.",
        "“I guess this is all right, Mr. Kline,” said one of the officers.\n“It’s Larry the Bat, and he’s doped to the eyes.  There’s the stuff\non the floor we knocked off the chair.”",
        "“Light the gas!” directed Kline curtly; and, being obeyed, stooped\nto the floor and picked up a hypodermic syringe and a small bottle.\nHe held the bottle to the light, and read the label: LIQUOR\nMORPHINAE.   “Shake him again!” he commanded.",
        "None too gently, a policeman caught Jimmie Dale by the shoulder and\nshook him vigorously–again Jimmie Dale, once the other let go his\nhold, fell back limply on the bed, breathing in that same, slightly\nslowed way.",
        "“Larry the Bat, eh?” grunted Kline; then, to the officer who had\nvolunteered the information: “Who’s Larry the Bat?  What is he?  And\nhow long have you known him?”",
        "“I don’t know who he is any more than what you can see there for\nyourself,” replied the officer.  “He’s a dope fiend, and I guess a\npretty tough case, though we’ve never had him up for anything.  He’s\nlived here ever since I’ve been on the beat, and that’s three years\nor–”",
        "“All right!” interrupted Kline crisply.  “He’s no good to us!  You\nsay there’s an exit from this house into that saloon at the back?”",
        "“Yes, sir but the fellow, whoever he is, couldn’t get away from\nthere.  Heeney’s been over on guard from the start.”",
        "“Then he’s still inside there,” said Kline, clipping off his words.\n“We’ll search the saloon.  Nice night’s work this is!  One out of\nthe whole gang–and that one with the compliments of the Gray Seal!”",
        "The men went out and began to descend the stairs.",
        "“One,” said Jimmie Dale to himself, still motionless, still\nbreathing in that slow way so characteristic of the drug.  “Two.\nThree.  Four.”",
        "The minutes went by–a quarter of an hour–a half hour.  Still\nJimmie Dale lay there–still motionless–still breathing with slow\nregularity.  His muscles began to cramp, to give him exquisite\ntorture.  Around him all was silence–only distant sounds from the\nstreet reached him, muffled, and at intervals.  Another quarter of\nan hour passed–an eternity of torment.  It seemed to Jimmie Dale,\nfor all his will power, that he could not hold himself in check,\nthat he must move, scream out even in the torture that was passing\nall endurance.  It was silent now, utterly silent–and then out of\nthe silence, just outside his door, a footstep creaked–and a man\nwalked to the stairs and went down.",
        "“Five,” said Jimmie Dale to himself.  “The sharpest man in the\nUnited States secret service.”",
        "And then for the first time Jimmie Dale moved–to wipe away the\nbeads of sweat that had sprung out upon his forehead.",
