        "Exeter, the metropolis of the west, was known as a city even when the\nRomans came to Britain. There are no important Roman buildings left now,\nbut coins and pottery testify to the Roman occupation. The first actual\nhistoric records date from the reign of King Alfred, whose grandson,\nAthelstane, made Exeter into a strong city, fortifying it with walls.\nExeter made a stubborn resistance to William the Conqueror, but when\nbesieged by him was forced to yield. The city suffered siege on two\nother notable occasions. In the reign of Henry VII., Perkin Warbeck, the\npretender, made an attack on the castle, but was defeated. In 1646 the\ncity was blockaded by the Parliamentary forces under Fairfax and\ncompelled to surrender.",
        "In the centre of the city is the cathedral, which was commenced in A.D.\n1107 by Bishop Warelwast, who built the massive Norman towers. Bishop\nQuivil, who died in 1292, completely remodelled the cathedral, changing\nthe somewhat heavy Norman structure into the present graceful Gothic\none. The successor of Bishop Quivil carried out the plans he left behind\nhim, and the cathedral was finished in 1350, although some minor work\nremained to be done. Unlike so many of the early cathedrals, Exeter has\nno central tower, therefore its interior is famous for having the most\nuninterrupted vista of any cathedral in England, having no tower-piers\nto hinder the view. One of the most beautiful features is the carved\nwest front.",
        "Standing on the highest ground in Exeter, though not now conspicuous,\nare the ruined walls of the Norman castle, called Rougemont (Red Mount),\nwhich obtained its name from the red clay found there. The High Street\ncontains many old and picturesque buildings, the most important of which\nis the Guildhall, built in the fifteenth century, but altered during the\nlate Renaissance period. Many of the parish churches of Exeter are\nworthy of note.",
