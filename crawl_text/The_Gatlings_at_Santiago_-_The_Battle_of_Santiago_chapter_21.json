        "My own health was impaired by overexertion in the sun and intense heat\nof the day before, which prevented me from participating as actively\nin the battle as I desired; but from a high hill near my headquarters\nI had a general view of the battle-field, extending from El Caney on\nthe right to the left of our lines on San Juan Hill. His staff\nofficers were stationed at various points on the field, rendering\nfrequent reports, and through them, by the means of orderlies and the\ntelephone, I was enabled to transmit my orders. During the afternoon I\nvisited the position of Grimes’ Battery on the heights of El Pozo, and\nsaw Sumner and Kent in firm possession of San Juan Hill, which I\ndirected should be intrenched during the night. My engineer officer,\nLieut.-Col. Derby, collected and sent forward the necessary tools, and\nduring the night trenches of very considerable strength were\nconstructed.",
        "During the afternoon, Maj. Dillenback, by my order, brought forward\nthe two remaining batteries of his battalion and put them in position\nat El Pozo, to the left of Grimes. Later in the afternoon all three\nbatteries were moved forward to positions near the firing-line, but\nthe nature of the country and the intensity of the enemy’s small-arm\nfire was such that no substantial results were gained by our artillery\nin the new positions. The batteries were intrenched during the night.\nGen. Duffield, with the 33d Michigan, attacked Aguadores, as ordered,\nbut was unable to accomplish more than to detain the Spaniards in that\nvicinity.",
        "After the brilliant and important victory gained at El Caney, Lawton\nstarted his tried troops, who had been fighting all day and marching\nmuch of the night before, to connect with the right of the cavalry\ndivision. Night came on before this movement could be accomplished. In\nthe darkness the enemy’s pickets were encountered, and the division\ncommander, being uncertain of the ground and as to what might be in\nhis front, halted his command and reported the situation to me. This\ninformation was received about 12:30 a. m., and I directed Gen. Lawton\nto return by my headquarters and the El Pozo house as the only certain\nway of gaining his new position.",
        "This was done, and the division took position on the right of the\ncavalry early next morning; Chaffee’s Brigade arriving first, about\nhalf-past seven, and the other brigades before noon.",
        "On the night of July 1st, I ordered Gen. Duffield, at Siboney, to send\nforward the 34th Michigan and the 9th Massachusetts. Both of which had\njust arrived from the United States. These regiments reached the front\nthe next morning. The 34th was placed in rear of Kent, and the 9th was\nassigned to Bates, who placed it on his left.",
        "Soon after daylight on July 2d the enemy opened battle, but because of\nthe intrenchments made during the night, the approach of Lawton’s\nDivision, and the presence of Bates’ Brigade, which had taken position\nduring the night on Kent’s left, little apprehension was felt as to\nour ability to repel the Spaniards.",
        "It is proper here to state that Gen. Bates and his brigade had\nperformed most arduous and efficient service, having marched much of\nthe night of June 30th-July 1st, and a good part of the latter day,\nduring which he also participated in the battle of El Caney, after\nwhich he proceeded, by way of El Pozo, to the left of the line at San\nJuan, reaching his new position about midnight.",
        "All day on the 2d the battle raged with more or less fury, but such of\nour troops as were in position at daylight held their ground, and\nLawton gained a strong and commanding position on the right.",
        "About 10 p. m. the enemy made a vigorous assault to break through my\nlines, but he was repulsed at all points.",
