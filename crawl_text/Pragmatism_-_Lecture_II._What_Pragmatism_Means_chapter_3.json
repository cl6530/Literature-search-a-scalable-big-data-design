        "Some years ago, being with a camping party in the mountains, I\nreturned from a solitary ramble to find everyone engaged in a\nferocious metaphysical dispute. The corpus of the dispute was a\nsquirrel–a live squirrel supposed to be clinging to one side of a\ntree-trunk; while over against the tree’s opposite side a human\nbeing was imagined to stand. This human witness tries to get sight\nof the squirrel by moving rapidly round the tree, but no matter how\nfast he goes, the squirrel moves as fast in the opposite direction,\nand always keeps the tree between himself and the man, so that never\na glimpse of him is caught. The resultant metaphysical problem now\nis this: DOES THE MAN GO ROUND THE SQUIRREL OR NOT? He goes round\nthe tree, sure enough, and the squirrel is on the tree; but does he\ngo round the squirrel? In the unlimited leisure of the wilderness,\ndiscussion had been worn threadbare. Everyone had taken sides, and\nwas obstinate; and the numbers on both sides were even. Each side,\nwhen I appeared, therefore appealed to me to make it a majority.\nMindful of the scholastic adage that whenever you meet a\ncontradiction you must make a distinction, I immediately sought and\nfound one, as follows: “Which party is right,” I said, “depends on\nwhat you PRACTICALLY MEAN by ’going round’ the squirrel. If you mean\npassing from the north of him to the east, then to the south, then\nto the west, and then to the north of him again, obviously the man\ndoes go round him, for he occupies these successive positions. But\nif on the contrary you mean being first in front of him, then on the\nright of him, then behind him, then on his left, and finally in\nfront again, it is quite as obvious that the man fails to go round\nhim, for by the compensating movements the squirrel makes, he keeps\nhis belly turned towards the man all the time, and his back turned\naway. Make the distinction, and there is no occasion for any farther\ndispute. You are both right and both wrong according as you conceive\nthe verb ’to go round’ in one practical fashion or the other.”",
        "Altho one or two of the hotter disputants called my speech a\nshuffling evasion, saying they wanted no quibbling or scholastic\nhair-splitting, but meant just plain honest English ’round,’ the\nmajority seemed to think that the distinction had assuaged the\ndispute.",
        "I tell this trivial anecdote because it is a peculiarly simple\nexample of what I wish now to speak of as THE PRAGMATIC METHOD. The\npragmatic method is primarily a method of settling metaphysical\ndisputes that otherwise might be interminable. Is the world one or\nmany?–fated or free?–material or spiritual?–here are notions\neither of which may or may not hold good of the world; and disputes\nover such notions are unending. The pragmatic method in such cases\nis to try to interpret each notion by tracing its respective\npractical consequences. What difference would it practically make to\nanyone if this notion rather than that notion were true? If no\npractical difference whatever can be traced, then the alternatives\nmean practically the same thing, and all dispute is idle. Whenever a\ndispute is serious, we ought to be able to show some practical\ndifference that must follow from one side or the other’s being\nright.",
        "A glance at the history of the idea will show you still better what\npragmatism means. The term is derived from the same Greek word [pi\nrho alpha gamma mu alpha], meaning action, from which our words\n’practice’ and ’practical’ come. It was first introduced into\nphilosophy by Mr. Charles Peirce in 1878. In an article entitled\n’How to Make Our Ideas Clear,’ in the ’Popular Science Monthly’ for\nJanuary of that year [Footnote: Translated in the Revue\nPhilosophique for January, 1879 (vol. vii).] Mr. Peirce, after\npointing out that our beliefs are really rules for action, said that\nto develope a thought’s meaning, we need only determine what conduct\nit is fitted to produce: that conduct is for us its sole\nsignificance. And the tangible fact at the root of all our thought-\ndistinctions, however subtle, is that there is no one of them so\nfine as to consist in anything but a possible difference of\npractice. To attain perfect clearness in our thoughts of an object,\nthen, we need only consider what conceivable effects of a practical\nkind the object may involve–what sensations we are to expect from\nit, and what reactions we must prepare. Our conception of these\neffects, whether immediate or remote, is then for us the whole of\nour conception of the object, so far as that conception has positive\nsignificance at all.",
        "This is the principle of Peirce, the principle of pragmatism. It lay\nentirely unnoticed by anyone for twenty years, until I, in an\naddress before Professor Howison’s philosophical union at the\nuniversity of California, brought it forward again and made a\nspecial application of it to religion. By that date (1898) the times\nseemed ripe for its reception. The word ’pragmatism’ spread, and at\npresent it fairly spots the pages of the philosophic journals. On\nall hands we find the ’pragmatic movement’ spoken of, sometimes with\nrespect, sometimes with contumely, seldom with clear understanding.\nIt is evident that the term applies itself conveniently to a number\nof tendencies that hitherto have lacked a collective name, and that\nit has ’come to stay.’",
        "To take in the importance of Peirce’s principle, one must get\naccustomed to applying it to concrete cases. I found a few years ago\nthat Ostwald, the illustrious Leipzig chemist, had been making\nperfectly distinct use of the principle of pragmatism in his\nlectures on the philosophy of science, tho he had not called it by\nthat name.",
        "“All realities influence our practice,” he wrote me, “and that\ninfluence is their meaning for us. I am accustomed to put questions\nto my classes in this way: In what respects would the world be\ndifferent if this alternative or that were true? If I can find\nnothing that would become different, then the alternative has no\nsense.”",
        "That is, the rival views mean practically the same thing, and\nmeaning, other than practical, there is for us none. Ostwald in a\npublished lecture gives this example of what he means. Chemists have\nlong wrangled over the inner constitution of certain bodies called\n’tautomerous.’ Their properties seemed equally consistent with the\nnotion that an instable hydrogen atom oscillates inside of them, or\nthat they are instable mixtures of two bodies. Controversy raged;\nbut never was decided. “It would never have begun,” says Ostwald,\n“if the combatants had asked themselves what particular experimental\nfact could have been made different by one or the other view being\ncorrect. For it would then have appeared that no difference of fact\ncould possibly ensue; and the quarrel was as unreal as if,\ntheorizing in primitive times about the raising of dough by yeast,\none party should have invoked a ’brownie,’ while another insisted on\nan ’elf’ as the true cause of the phenomenon.” [Footnote: ’Theorie\nund Praxis,’ Zeitsch. des Oesterreichischen Ingenieur u.\nArchitecten-Vereines, 1905, Nr. 4 u. 6. I find a still more radical\npragmatism than Ostwald’s in an address by Professor W. S. Franklin:\n“I think that the sickliest notion of physics, even if a student\ngets it, is that it is ’the science of masses, molecules and the\nether.’ And I think that the healthiest notion, even if a student\ndoes not wholly get it, is that physics is the science of the ways\nof taking hold of bodies and pushing them!” (Science, January 2,\n1903.)]",
        "It is astonishing to see how many philosophical disputes collapse\ninto insignificance the moment you subject them to this simple test\nof tracing a concrete consequence. There can BE no difference any-\nwhere that doesn’t MAKE a difference elsewhere–no difference in\nabstract truth that doesn’t express itself in a difference in\nconcrete fact and in conduct consequent upon that fact, imposed on\nsomebody, somehow, somewhere and somewhen. The whole function of\nphilosophy ought to be to find out what definite difference it will\nmake to you and me, at definite instants of our life, if this world-\nformula or that world-formula be the true one.",
        "There is absolutely nothing new in the pragmatic method. Socrates\nwas an adept at it. Aristotle used it methodically. Locke, Berkeley\nand Hume made momentous contributions to truth by its means.\nShadworth Hodgson keeps insisting that realities are only what they\nare ’known-as.’ But these forerunners of pragmatism used it in\nfragments: they were preluders only. Not until in our time has it\ngeneralized itself, become conscious of a universal mission,\npretended to a conquering destiny. I believe in that destiny, and I\nhope I may end by inspiring you with my belief.",
        "Pragmatism represents a perfectly familiar attitude in philosophy,\nthe empiricist attitude, but it represents it, as it seems to me,\nboth in a more radical and in a less objectionable form than it has\never yet assumed. A pragmatist turns his back resolutely and once\nfor all upon a lot of inveterate habits dear to professional\nphilosophers. He turns away from abstraction and insufficiency, from\nverbal solutions, from bad a priori reasons, from fixed principles,\nclosed systems, and pretended absolutes and origins. He turns\ntowards concreteness and adequacy, towards facts, towards action,\nand towards power. That means the empiricist temper regnant, and the\nrationalist temper sincerely given up. It means the open air and\npossibilities of nature, as against dogma, artificiality and the\npretence of finality in truth.",
        "At the same time it does not stand for any special results. It is a\nmethod only. But the general triumph of that method would mean an\nenormous change in what I called in my last lecture the\n’temperament’ of philosophy. Teachers of the ultra-rationalistic\ntype would be frozen out, much as the courtier type is frozen out in\nrepublics, as the ultramontane type of priest is frozen out in\nprotestant lands. Science and metaphysics would come much nearer\ntogether, would in fact work absolutely hand in hand.",
        "Metaphysics has usually followed a very primitive kind of quest. You\nknow how men have always hankered after unlawful magic, and you know\nwhat a great part, in magic, WORDS have always played. If you have\nhis name, or the formula of incantation that binds him, you can\ncontrol the spirit, genie, afrite, or whatever the power may be.\nSolomon knew the names of all the spirits, and having their names,\nhe held them subject to his will. So the universe has always\nappeared to the natural mind as a kind of enigma, of which the key\nmust be sought in the shape of some illuminating or power-bringing\nword or name. That word names the universe’s PRINCIPLE, and to\npossess it is, after a fashion, to possess the universe itself.\n’God,’ ’Matter,’ ’Reason,’ ’the Absolute,’ ’Energy,’ are so many\nsolving names. You can rest when you have them. You are at the end\nof your metaphysical quest.",
        "But if you follow the pragmatic method, you cannot look on any such\nword as closing your quest. You must bring out of each word its\npractical cash-value, set it at work within the stream of your\nexperience. It appears less as a solution, then, than as a program\nfor more work, and more particularly as an indication of the ways in\nwhich existing realities may be CHANGED.",
        "THEORIES THUS BECOME INSTRUMENTS, NOT ANSWERS TO ENIGMAS, IN WHICH\nWE CAN REST. We don’t lie back upon them, we move forward, and, on\noccasion, make nature over again by their aid. Pragmatism unstiffens\nall our theories, limbers them up and sets each one at work. Being\nnothing essentially new, it harmonizes with many ancient philosophic\ntendencies. It agrees with nominalism for instance, in always\nappealing to particulars; with utilitarianism in emphasizing\npractical aspects; with positivism in its disdain for verbal\nsolutions, useless questions, and metaphysical abstractions.",
        "All these, you see, are ANTI-INTELLECTUALIST tendencies. Against\nrationalism as a pretension and a method, pragmatism is fully armed\nand militant. But, at the outset, at least, it stands for no\nparticular results. It has no dogmas, and no doctrines save its\nmethod. As the young Italian pragmatist Papini has well said, it\nlies in the midst of our theories, like a corridor in a hotel.\nInnumerable chambers open out of it. In one you may find a man\nwriting an atheistic volume; in the next someone on his knees\npraying for faith and strength; in a third a chemist investigating a\nbody’s properties. In a fourth a system of idealistic metaphysics is\nbeing excogitated; in a fifth the impossibility of metaphysics is\nbeing shown. But they all own the corridor, and all must pass\nthrough it if they want a practicable way of getting into or out of\ntheir respective rooms.",
        "No particular results then, so far, but only an attitude of\norientation, is what the pragmatic method means. THE ATTITUDE OF\nLOOKING AWAY FROM FIRST THINGS, PRINCIPLES, ’CATEGORIES,’ SUPPOSED\nNECESSITIES; AND OF LOOKING TOWARDS LAST THINGS, FRUITS,\nCONSEQUENCES, FACTS.",
        "So much for the pragmatic method! You may say that I have been\npraising it rather than explaining it to you, but I shall presently\nexplain it abundantly enough by showing how it works on some\nfamiliar problems. Meanwhile the word pragmatism has come to be used\nin a still wider sense, as meaning also a certain theory of TRUTH. I\nmean to give a whole lecture to the statement of that theory, after\nfirst paving the way, so I can be very brief now. But brevity is\nhard to follow, so I ask for your redoubled attention for a quarter\nof an hour. If much remains obscure, I hope to make it clearer in\nthe later lectures.",
        "One of the most successfully cultivated branches of philosophy in\nour time is what is called inductive logic, the study of the\nconditions under which our sciences have evolved. Writers on this\nsubject have begun to show a singular unanimity as to what the laws\nof nature and elements of fact mean, when formulated by\nmathematicians, physicists and chemists. When the first\nmathematical, logical and natural uniformities, the first LAWS, were\ndiscovered, men were so carried away by the clearness, beauty and\nsimplification that resulted, that they believed themselves to have\ndeciphered authentically the eternal thoughts of the Almighty. His\nmind also thundered and reverberated in syllogisms. He also thought\nin conic sections, squares and roots and ratios, and geometrized\nlike Euclid. He made Kepler’s laws for the planets to follow; he\nmade velocity increase proportionally to the time in falling bodies;\nhe made the law of the sines for light to obey when refracted; he\nestablished the classes, orders, families and genera of plants and\nanimals, and fixed the distances between them. He thought the\narchetypes of all things, and devised their variations; and when we\nrediscover any one of these his wondrous institutions, we seize his\nmind in its very literal intention.",
        "But as the sciences have developed farther, the notion has gained\nground that most, perhaps all, of our laws are only approximations.\nThe laws themselves, moreover, have grown so numerous that there is\nno counting them; and so many rival formulations are proposed in all\nthe branches of science that investigators have become accustomed to\nthe notion that no theory is absolutely a transcript of reality, but\nthat any one of them may from some point of view be useful. Their\ngreat use is to summarize old facts and to lead to new ones. They\nare only a man-made language, a conceptual shorthand, as someone\ncalls them, in which we write our reports of nature; and languages,\nas is well known, tolerate much choice of expression and many\ndialects.",
        "Thus human arbitrariness has driven divine necessity from scientific\nlogic. If I mention the names of Sigwart, Mach, Ostwald, Pearson,\nMilhaud, Poincare, Duhem, Ruyssen, those of you who are students\nwill easily identify the tendency I speak of, and will think of\nadditional names.",
        "Riding now on the front of this wave of scientific logic Messrs.\nSchiller and Dewey appear with their pragmatistic account of what\ntruth everywhere signifies. Everywhere, these teachers say, ’truth’\nin our ideas and beliefs means the same thing that it means in\nscience. It means, they say, nothing but this, THAT IDEAS (WHICH\nTHEMSELVES ARE BUT PARTS OF OUR EXPERIENCE) BECOME TRUE JUST IN SO\nFAR AS THEY HELP US TO GET INTO SATISFACTORY RELATION WITH OTHER\nPARTS OF OUR EXPERIENCE, to summarize them and get about among them\nby conceptual short-cuts instead of following the interminable\nsuccession of particular phenomena. Any idea upon which we can ride,\nso to speak; any idea that will carry us prosperously from any one\npart of our experience to any other part, linking things\nsatisfactorily, working securely, simplifying, saving labor; is true\nfor just so much, true in so far forth, true INSTRUMENTALLY. This is\nthe ’instrumental’ view of truth taught so successfully at Chicago,\nthe view that truth in our ideas means their power to ’work,’\npromulgated so brilliantly at Oxford.",
        "Messrs. Dewey, Schiller and their allies, in reaching this general\nconception of all truth, have only followed the example of\ngeologists, biologists and philologists. In the establishment of\nthese other sciences, the successful stroke was always to take some\nsimple process actually observable in operation–as denudation by\nweather, say, or variation from parental type, or change of dialect\nby incorporation of new words and pronunciations–and then to\ngeneralize it, making it apply to all times, and produce great\nresults by summating its effects through the ages.",
        "The observable process which Schiller and Dewey particularly singled\nout for generalization is the familiar one by which any individual\nsettles into NEW OPINIONS. The process here is always the same. The\nindividual has a stock of old opinions already, but he meets a new\nexperience that puts them to a strain. Somebody contradicts them; or\nin a reflective moment he discovers that they contradict each other;\nor he hears of facts with which they are incompatible; or desires\narise in him which they cease to satisfy. The result is an inward\ntrouble to which his mind till then had been a stranger, and from\nwhich he seeks to escape by modifying his previous mass of opinions.\nHe saves as much of it as he can, for in this matter of belief we\nare all extreme conservatives. So he tries to change first this\nopinion, and then that (for they resist change very variously),\nuntil at last some new idea comes up which he can graft upon the\nancient stock with a minimum of disturbance of the latter, some idea\nthat mediates between the stock and the new experience and runs them\ninto one another most felicitously and expediently.",
        "This new idea is then adopted as the true one. It preserves the\nolder stock of truths with a minimum of modification, stretching\nthem just enough to make them admit the novelty, but conceiving that\nin ways as familiar as the case leaves possible. An outree\nexplanation, violating all our preconceptions, would never pass for\na true account of a novelty. We should scratch round industriously\ntill we found something less excentric. The most violent revolutions\nin an individual’s beliefs leave most of his old order standing.\nTime and space, cause and effect, nature and history, and one’s own\nbiography remain untouched. New truth is always a go-between, a\nsmoother-over of transitions. It marries old opinion to new fact so\nas ever to show a minimum of jolt, a maximum of continuity. We hold\na theory true just in proportion to its success in solving this\n’problem of maxima and minima.’ But success in solving this problem\nis eminently a matter of approximation. We say this theory solves it\non the whole more satisfactorily than that theory; but that means\nmore satisfactorily to ourselves, and individuals will emphasize\ntheir points of satisfaction differently. To a certain degree,\ntherefore, everything here is plastic.",
        "The point I now urge you to observe particularly is the part played\nby the older truths. Failure to take account of it is the source of\nmuch of the unjust criticism leveled against pragmatism. Their\ninfluence is absolutely controlling. Loyalty to them is the first\nprinciple–in most cases it is the only principle; for by far the\nmost usual way of handling phenomena so novel that they would make\nfor a serious rearrangement of our preconceptions is to ignore them\naltogether, or to abuse those who bear witness for them.",
        "You doubtless wish examples of this process of truth’s growth, and\nthe only trouble is their superabundance. The simplest case of new\ntruth is of course the mere numerical addition of new kinds of\nfacts, or of new single facts of old kinds, to our experience–an\naddition that involves no alteration in the old beliefs. Day follows\nday, and its contents are simply added. The new contents themselves\nare not true, they simply COME and ARE. Truth is what we say about\nthem, and when we say that they have come, truth is satisfied by the\nplain additive formula.",
        "But often the day’s contents oblige a rearrangement. If I should now\nutter piercing shrieks and act like a maniac on this platform, it\nwould make many of you revise your ideas as to the probable worth of\nmy philosophy. ’Radium’ came the other day as part of the day’s\ncontent, and seemed for a moment to contradict our ideas of the\nwhole order of nature, that order having come to be identified with\nwhat is called the conservation of energy. The mere sight of radium\npaying heat away indefinitely out of its own pocket seemed to\nviolate that conservation. What to think? If the radiations from it\nwere nothing but an escape of unsuspected ’potential’ energy, pre-\nexistent inside of the atoms, the principle of conservation would be\nsaved. The discovery of ’helium’ as the radiation’s outcome, opened\na way to this belief. So Ramsay’s view is generally held to be true,\nbecause, altho it extends our old ideas of energy, it causes a\nminimum of alteration in their nature.",
        "I need not multiply instances. A new opinion counts as ’true’ just\nin proportion as it gratifies the individual’s desire to assimilate\nthe novel in his experience to his beliefs in stock. It must both\nlean on old truth and grasp new fact; and its success (as I said a\nmoment ago) in doing this, is a matter for the individual’s\nappreciation. When old truth grows, then, by new truth’s addition,\nit is for subjective reasons. We are in the process and obey the\nreasons. That new idea is truest which performs most felicitously\nits function of satisfying our double urgency. It makes itself true,\ngets itself classed as true, by the way it works; grafting itself\nthen upon the ancient body of truth, which thus grows much as a tree\ngrows by the activity of a new layer of cambium.",
        "Now Dewey and Schiller proceed to generalize this observation and to\napply it to the most ancient parts of truth. They also once were\nplastic. They also were called true for human reasons. They also\nmediated between still earlier truths and what in those days were\nnovel observations. Purely objective truth, truth in whose\nestablishment the function of giving human satisfaction in marrying\nprevious parts of experience with newer parts played no role\nwhatever, is nowhere to be found. The reasons why we call things\ntrue is the reason why they ARE true, for ’to be true’ MEANS only to\nperform this marriage-function.",
        "The trail of the human serpent is thus over everything. Truth\nindependent; truth that we FIND merely; truth no longer malleable to\nhuman need; truth incorrigible, in a word; such truth exists indeed\nsuperabundantly–or is supposed to exist by rationalistically minded\nthinkers; but then it means only the dead heart of the living tree,\nand its being there means only that truth also has its paleontology\nand its ’prescription,’ and may grow stiff with years of veteran\nservice and petrified in men’s regard by sheer antiquity. But how\nplastic even the oldest truths nevertheless really are has been\nvividly shown in our day by the transformation of logical and\nmathematical ideas, a transformation which seems even to be invading\nphysics. The ancient formulas are reinterpreted as special\nexpressions of much wider principles, principles that our ancestors\nnever got a glimpse of in their present shape and formulation.",
        "Mr. Schiller still gives to all this view of truth the name of\n’Humanism,’ but, for this doctrine too, the name of pragmatism seems\nfairly to be in the ascendant, so I will treat it under the name of\npragmatism in these lectures.",
        "Such then would be the scope of pragmatism–first, a method; and\nsecond, a genetic theory of what is meant by truth. And these two\nthings must be our future topics.",
        "What I have said of the theory of truth will, I am sure, have\nappeared obscure and unsatisfactory to most of you by reason of us\nbrevity. I shall make amends for that hereafter. In a lecture on\n’common sense’ I shall try to show what I mean by truths grown\npetrified by antiquity. In another lecture I shall expatiate on the\nidea that our thoughts become true in proportion as they\nsuccessfully exert their go-between function. In a third I shall\nshow how hard it is to discriminate subjective from objective\nfactors in Truth’s development. You may not follow me wholly in\nthese lectures; and if you do, you may not wholly agree with me. But\nyou will, I know, regard me at least as serious, and treat my effort\nwith respectful consideration.",
        "You will probably be surprised to learn, then, that Messrs.\nSchiller’s and Dewey’s theories have suffered a hailstorm of\ncontempt and ridicule. All rationalism has risen against them. In\ninfluential quarters Mr. Schiller, in particular, has been treated\nlike an impudent schoolboy who deserves a spanking. I should not\nmention this, but for the fact that it throws so much sidelight upon\nthat rationalistic temper to which I have opposed the temper of\npragmatism. Pragmatism is uncomfortable away from facts. Rationalism\nis comfortable only in the presence of abstractions. This pragmatist\ntalk about truths in the plural, about their utility and\nsatisfactoriness, about the success with which they ’work,’ etc.,\nsuggests to the typical intellectualist mind a sort of coarse lame\nsecond-rate makeshift article of truth. Such truths are not real\ntruth. Such tests are merely subjective. As against this, objective\ntruth must be something non-utilitarian, haughty, refined, remote,\naugust, exalted. It must be an absolute correspondence of our\nthoughts with an equally absolute reality. It must be what we OUGHT\nto think, unconditionally. The conditioned ways in which we DO think\nare so much irrelevance and matter for psychology. Down with\npsychology, up with logic, in all this question!",
        "See the exquisite contrast of the types of mind! The pragmatist\nclings to facts and concreteness, observes truth at its work in\nparticular cases, and generalizes. Truth, for him, becomes a class-\nname for all sorts of definite working-values in experience. For the\nrationalist it remains a pure abstraction, to the bare name of which\nwe must defer. When the pragmatist undertakes to show in detail just\nWHY we must defer, the rationalist is unable to recognize the\nconcretes from which his own abstraction is taken. He accuses us of\nDENYING truth; whereas we have only sought to trace exactly why\npeople follow it and always ought to follow it. Your typical ultra-\nabstractionist fairly shudders at concreteness: other things equal,\nhe positively prefers the pale and spectral. If the two universes\nwere offered, he would always choose the skinny outline rather than\nthe rich thicket of reality. It is so much purer, clearer, nobler.",
        "I hope that as these lectures go on, the concreteness and closeness\nto facts of the pragmatism which they advocate may be what approves\nitself to you as its most satisfactory peculiarity. It only follows\nhere the example of the sister-sciences, interpreting the unobserved\nby the observed. It brings old and new harmoniously together. It\nconverts the absolutely empty notion of a static relation of\n’correspondence’ (what that may mean we must ask later) between our\nminds and reality, into that of a rich and active commerce (that\nanyone may follow in detail and understand) between particular\nthoughts of ours, and the great universe of other experiences in\nwhich they play their parts and have their uses.",
        "But enough of this at present? The justification of what I say must\nbe postponed. I wish now to add a word in further explanation of the\nclaim I made at our last meeting, that pragmatism may be a happy\nharmonizer of empiricist ways of thinking, with the more religious\ndemands of human beings.",
        "Men who are strongly of the fact-loving temperament, you may\nremember me to have said, are liable to be kept at a distance by the\nsmall sympathy with facts which that philosophy from the present-day\nfashion of idealism offers them. It is far too intellectualistic.\nOld fashioned theism was bad enough, with its notion of God as an\nexalted monarch, made up of a lot of unintelligible or preposterous\n’attributes’; but, so long as it held strongly by the argument from\ndesign, it kept some touch with concrete realities. Since, however,\ndarwinism has once for all displaced design from the minds of the\n’scientific,’ theism has lost that foothold; and some kind of an\nimmanent or pantheistic deity working IN things rather than above\nthem is, if any, the kind recommended to our contemporary\nimagination. Aspirants to a philosophic religion turn, as a rule,\nmore hopefully nowadays towards idealistic pantheism than towards\nthe older dualistic theism, in spite of the fact that the latter\nstill counts able defenders.",
        "But, as I said in my first lecture, the brand of pantheism offered\nis hard for them to assimilate if they are lovers of facts, or\nempirically minded. It is the absolutistic brand, spurning the dust\nand reared upon pure logic. It keeps no connexion whatever with\nconcreteness. Affirming the Absolute Mind, which is its substitute\nfor God, to be the rational presupposition of all particulars of\nfact, whatever they may be, it remains supremely indifferent to what\nthe particular facts in our world actually are. Be they what they\nmay, the Absolute will father them. Like the sick lion in Esop’s\nfable, all footprints lead into his den, but nulla vestigia\nretrorsum. You cannot redescend into the world of particulars by the\nAbsolute’s aid, or deduce any necessary consequences of detail\nimportant for your life from your idea of his nature. He gives you\nindeed the assurance that all is well with Him, and for his eternal\nway of thinking; but thereupon he leaves you to be finitely saved by\nyour own temporal devices.",
        "Far be it from me to deny the majesty of this conception, or its\ncapacity to yield religious comfort to a most respectable class of\nminds. But from the human point of view, no one can pretend that it\ndoesn’t suffer from the faults of remoteness and abstractness. It is\neminently a product of what I have ventured to call the\nrationalistic temper. It disdains empiricism’s needs. It substitutes\na pallid outline for the real world’s richness. It is dapper; it is\nnoble in the bad sense, in the sense in which to be noble is to be\ninapt for humble service. In this real world of sweat and dirt, it\nseems to me that when a view of things is ’noble,’ that ought to\ncount as a presumption against its truth, and as a philosophic\ndisqualification. The prince of darkness may be a gentleman, as we\nare told he is, but whatever the God of earth and heaven is, he can\nsurely be no gentleman. His menial services are needed in the dust\nof our human trials, even more than his dignity is needed in the\nempyrean.",
        "Now pragmatism, devoted tho she be to facts, has no such\nmaterialistic bias as ordinary empiricism labors under. Moreover,\nshe has no objection whatever to the realizing of abstractions, so\nlong as you get about among particulars with their aid and they\nactually carry you somewhere. Interested in no conclusions but those\nwhich our minds and our experiences work out together, she has no a\npriori prejudices against theology. IF THEOLOGICAL IDEAS PROVE TO\nHAVE A VALUE FOR CONCRETE LIFE, THEY WILL BE TRUE, FOR PRAGMATISM,\nIN THE SENSE OF BEING GOOD FOR SO MUCH. FOR HOW MUCH MORE THEY ARE\nTRUE, WILL DEPEND ENTIRELY ON THEIR RELATIONS TO THE OTHER TRUTHS\nTHAT ALSO HAVE TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED.",
        "What I said just now about the Absolute of transcendental idealism\nis a case in point. First, I called it majestic and said it yielded\nreligious comfort to a class of minds, and then I accused it of\nremoteness and sterility. But so far as it affords such comfort, it\nsurely is not sterile; it has that amount of value; it performs a\nconcrete function. As a good pragmatist, I myself ought to call the\nAbsolute true ’in so far forth,’ then; and I unhesitatingly now do\nso.",
        "But what does TRUE IN SO FAR FORTH mean in this case? To answer, we\nneed only apply the pragmatic method. What do believers in the\nAbsolute mean by saying that their belief affords them comfort? They\nmean that since in the Absolute finite evil is ’overruled’ already,\nwe may, therefore, whenever we wish, treat the temporal as if it\nwere potentially the eternal, be sure that we can trust its outcome,\nand, without sin, dismiss our fear and drop the worry of our finite\nresponsibility. In short, they mean that we have a right ever and\nanon to take a moral holiday, to let the world wag in its own way,\nfeeling that its issues are in better hands than ours and are none\nof our business.",
        "The universe is a system of which the individual members may relax\ntheir anxieties occasionally, in which the don’t-care mood is also\nright for men, and moral holidays in order–that, if I mistake not,\nis part, at least, of what the Absolute is ’known-as,’ that is the\ngreat difference in our particular experiences which his being true\nmakes for us, that is part of his cash-value when he is\npragmatically interpreted. Farther than that the ordinary lay-reader\nin philosophy who thinks favorably of absolute idealism does not\nventure to sharpen his conceptions. He can use the Absolute for so\nmuch, and so much is very precious. He is pained at hearing you\nspeak incredulously of the Absolute, therefore, and disregards your\ncriticisms because they deal with aspects of the conception that he\nfails to follow.",
        "If the Absolute means this, and means no more than this, who can\npossibly deny the truth of it? To deny it would be to insist that\nmen should never relax, and that holidays are never in order. I am\nwell aware how odd it must seem to some of you to hear me say that\nan idea is ’true’ so long as to believe it is profitable to our\nlives. That it is GOOD, for as much as it profits, you will gladly\nadmit. If what we do by its aid is good, you will allow the idea\nitself to be good in so far forth, for we are the better for\npossessing it. But is it not a strange misuse of the word ’truth,’\nyou will say, to call ideas also ’true’ for this reason?",
        "To answer this difficulty fully is impossible at this stage of my\naccount. You touch here upon the very central point of Messrs.\nSchiller’s, Dewey’s and my own doctrine of truth, which I cannot\ndiscuss with detail until my sixth lecture. Let me now say only\nthis, that truth is ONE SPECIES OF GOOD, and not, as is usually\nsupposed, a category distinct from good, and co-ordinate with it.\nTHE TRUE IS THE NAME OF WHATEVER PROVES ITSELF TO BE GOOD IN THE WAY\nOF BELIEF, AND GOOD, TOO, FOR DEFINITE, ASSIGNABLE REASONS. Surely\nyou must admit this, that if there were NO good for life in true\nideas, or if the knowledge of them were positively disadvantageous\nand false ideas the only useful ones, then the current notion that\ntruth is divine and precious, and its pursuit a duty, could never\nhave grown up or become a dogma. In a world like that, our duty\nwould be to SHUN truth, rather. But in this world, just as certain\nfoods are not only agreeable to our taste, but good for our teeth,\nour stomach and our tissues; so certain ideas are not only agreeable\nto think about, or agreeable as supporting other ideas that we are\nfond of, but they are also helpful in life’s practical struggles. If\nthere be any life that it is really better we should lead, and if\nthere be any idea which, if believed in, would help us to lead that\nlife, then it would be really BETTER FOR US to believe in that idea,\nUNLESS, INDEED, BELIEF IN IT INCIDENTALLY CLASHED WITH OTHER GREATER\nVITAL BENEFITS.",
        "’What would be better for us to believe’! This sounds very like a\ndefinition of truth. It comes very near to saying ’what we OUGHT to\nbelieve’: and in THAT definition none of you would find any oddity.\nOught we ever not to believe what it is BETTER FOR US to believe?\nAnd can we then keep the notion of what is better for us, and what\nis true for us, permanently apart?",
        "Pragmatism says no, and I fully agree with her. Probably you also\nagree, so far as the abstract statement goes, but with a suspicion\nthat if we practically did believe everything that made for good in\nour own personal lives, we should be found indulging all kinds of\nfancies about this world’s affairs, and all kinds of sentimental\nsuperstitions about a world hereafter. Your suspicion here is\nundoubtedly well founded, and it is evident that something happens\nwhen you pass from the abstract to the concrete, that complicates\nthe situation.",
        "I said just now that what is better for us to believe is true UNLESS\nTHE BELIEF INCIDENTALLY CLASHES WITH SOME OTHER VITAL BENEFIT. Now\nin real life what vital benefits is any particular belief of ours\nmost liable to clash with? What indeed except the vital benefits\nyielded by OTHER BELIEFS when these prove incompatible with the\nfirst ones? In other words, the greatest enemy of any one of our\ntruths may be the rest of our truths. Truths have once for all this\ndesperate instinct of self-preservation and of desire to extinguish\nwhatever contradicts them. My belief in the Absolute, based on the\ngood it does me, must run the gauntlet of all my other beliefs.\nGrant that it may be true in giving me a moral holiday.\nNevertheless, as I conceive it,–and let me speak now\nconfidentially, as it were, and merely in my own private person,–it\nclashes with other truths of mine whose benefits I hate to give up\non its account. It happens to be associated with a kind of logic of\nwhich I am the enemy, I find that it entangles me in metaphysical\nparadoxes that are inacceptable, etc., etc.. But as I have enough\ntrouble in life already without adding the trouble of carrying these\nintellectual inconsistencies, I personally just give up the\nAbsolute. I just TAKE my moral holidays; or else as a professional\nphilosopher, I try to justify them by some other principle.",
        "If I could restrict my notion of the Absolute to its bare holiday-\ngiving value, it wouldn’t clash with my other truths. But we cannot\neasily thus restrict our hypotheses. They carry supernumerary\nfeatures, and these it is that clash so. My disbelief in the\nAbsolute means then disbelief in those other supernumerary features,\nfor I fully believe in the legitimacy of taking moral holidays.",
        "You see by this what I meant when I called pragmatism a mediator and\nreconciler and said, borrowing the word from Papini, that he\nunstiffens our theories. She has in fact no prejudices whatever, no\nobstructive dogmas, no rigid canons of what shall count as proof.\nShe is completely genial. She will entertain any hypothesis, she\nwill consider any evidence. It follows that in the religious field\nshe is at a great advantage both over positivistic empiricism, with\nits anti-theological bias, and over religious rationalism, with its\nexclusive interest in the remote, the noble, the simple, and the\nabstract in the way of conception.",
        "In short, she widens the field of search for God. Rationalism sticks\nto logic and the empyrean. Empiricism sticks to the external senses.\nPragmatism is willing to take anything, to follow either logic or\nthe senses, and to count the humblest and most personal experiences.\nShe will count mystical experiences if they have practical\nconsequences. She will take a God who lives in the very dirt of\nprivate fact-if that should seem a likely place to find him.",
        "Her only test of probable truth is what works best in the way of\nleading us, what fits every part of life best and combines with the\ncollectivity of experience’s demands, nothing being omitted. If\ntheological ideas should do this, if the notion of God, in\nparticular, should prove to do it, how could pragmatism possibly\ndeny God’s existence? She could see no meaning in treating as ’not\ntrue’ a notion that was pragmatically so successful. What other kind\nof truth could there be, for her, than all this agreement with\nconcrete reality?",
        "In my last lecture I shall return again to the relations of\npragmatism with religion. But you see already how democratic she is.\nHer manners are as various and flexible, her resources as rich and\nendless, and her conclusions as friendly as those of mother nature.",
