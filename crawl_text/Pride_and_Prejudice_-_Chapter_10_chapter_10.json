        "The day passed much as the day before had done.  Mrs. Hurst\nand Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the\ninvalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the\nevening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.  The\nloo-table, however, did not appear.  Mr. Darcy was writing, and\nMiss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his\nletter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to\nhis sister.  Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.\nHurst was observing their game.",
        "Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently\namused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his\ncompanion.  The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on\nhis handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length\nof his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises\nwere received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in\nunion with her opinion of each.",
        "“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”",
        "He made no answer.",
        "“You write uncommonly fast.”",
        "“You are mistaken.  I write rather slowly.”",
        "“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the\ncourse of a year!  Letters of business, too!  How odious I should\nthink them!”",
        "“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.”",
        "“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”",
        "“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”",
        "“I am afraid you do not like your pen.  Let me mend it for you.\nI mend pens remarkably well.”",
        "“Thank you–but I always mend my own.”",
        "“How can you contrive to write so even?”",
        "He was silent.",
        "“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on\nthe harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with\nher beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely\nsuperior to Miss Grantley’s.”",
        "“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?\nAt present I have not room to do them justice.”",
        "“Oh! it is of no consequence.  I shall see her in January.  But do\nyou always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”",
        "“They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not\nfor me to determine.”",
        "“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter\nwith ease, cannot write ill.”",
        "“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried\nher brother, “because he does not write with ease.  He studies\ntoo much for words of four syllables.  Do not you, Darcy?”",
        "“My style of writing is very different from yours.”",
        "“Oh!” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless\nway imaginable.  He leaves out half his words, and blots the\nrest.”",
        "“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express\nthem–by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas\nat all to my correspondents.”",
        "“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm\nreproof.”",
        "“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of\nhumility.  It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes\nan indirect boast.”",
        "“And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of\nmodesty?”",
        "“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a\nrapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not\nestimable, you think at least highly interesting.  The power of\ndoing anything with quickness is always prized much by the\npossessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of\nthe performance.  When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that\nif you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be\ngone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of\ncompliment to yourself–and yet what is there so very laudable\nin a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone\nelse?”",
        "“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all\nthe foolish things that were said in the morning.  And yet, upon\nmy honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I\nbelieve it at this moment.  At least, therefore, I did not assume\nthe character of needless precipitance merely to show off before\nthe ladies.”",
        "“I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that\nyou would be gone with such celerity.  Your conduct would be\nquite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if,\nas you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say,  ’Bingley,\nyou had better stay till next week,’ you would probably do it,\nyou would probably not go–and at another word, might stay a\nmonth.”",
        "“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr.\nBingley did not do justice to his own disposition.  You have\nshown him off now much more than he did himself.”",
        "“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting\nwhat my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my\ntemper.  But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that\ngentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think\nbetter of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat\ndenial, and ride off as fast as I could.”",
        "“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original\nintentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”",
        "“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must\nspeak for himself.”",
        "“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to\ncall mine, but which I have never acknowledged.  Allowing the\ncase, however, to stand according to your representation, you\nmust remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to\ndesire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has\nmerely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in\nfavour of its propriety.”",
        "“To yield readily–easily–to the persuasion of a friend is\nno merit with you.”",
        "“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding\nof either.”",
        "“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the\ninfluence of friendship and affection.  A regard for the requester\nwould often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting\nfor arguments to reason one into it.  I am not particularly\nspeaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr.\nBingley.  We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance\noccurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\nthereupon.  But in general and ordinary cases between friend and\nfriend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a\nresolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that\nperson for complying with the desire, without waiting to be\nargued into it?”",
        "“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to\narrange with rather more precision the degree of importance\nwhich is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of\nintimacy subsisting between the parties?”",
        "“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars,\nnot forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will\nhave more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be\naware of.  I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall\nfellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so\nmuch deference.  I declare I do not know a more awful object\nthan Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at\nhis own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has\nnothing to do.”",
        "Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that\nhe was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh.  Miss\nBingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an\nexpostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.",
        "“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend.  “You dislike an\nargument, and want to silence this.”",
        "“Perhaps I do.  Arguments are too much like disputes.  If you and\nMiss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall\nbe very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”",
        "“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and\nMr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.”",
        "Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.",
        "When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and\nElizabeth for an indulgence of some music.  Miss Bingley moved\nwith some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request\nthat Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely\nand more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.",
        "Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus\nemployed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned\nover some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently\nMr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed on her.  She hardly knew how to\nsuppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a\nman; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her,\nwas still more strange.  She could only imagine, however, at last\nthat she drew his notice because there was something more wrong\nand reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any\nother person present.  The supposition did not pain her.  She\nliked him too little to care for his approbation.",
        "After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm\nby a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing\nnear Elizabeth, said to her:",
        "“Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such\nan opportunity of dancing a reel?”",
        "She smiled, but made no answer.  He repeated the question, with\nsome surprise at her silence.",
        "“Oh!” said she, “I heard you before, but I could not immediately\ndetermine what to say in reply.  You wanted me, I know, to say\n’Yes,’ that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste;\nbut I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes,\nand cheating a person of their premeditated contempt.  I have,\ntherefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to\ndance a reel at all–and now despise me if you dare.”",
        "“Indeed I do not dare.”",
        "Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at\nhis gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness\nin her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody;\nand Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he\nwas by her.  He really believed, that were it not for the\ninferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.",
        "Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her\ngreat anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received\nsome assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.",
        "She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by\ntalking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in\nsuch an alliance.",
        "“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the\nshrubbery the next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few\nhints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage\nof holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do sure the\nyounger girls of running after officers.  And, if I may mention so\ndelicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something,\nbordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady\npossesses.”",
        "“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”",
        "“Oh! yes.  Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be\nplaced in the gallery at Pemberley.  Put them next to your\ngreat-uncle the judge.  They are in the same profession, you\nknow, only in different lines.  As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you\nmust not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those\nbeautiful eyes?”",
        "“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their\ncolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might\nbe copied.”",
        "At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst\nand Elizabeth herself.",
        "“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley,\nin some confusion, lest they had been overheard.",
        "“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running\naway without telling us that you were coming out.”",
        "Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth\nto walk by herself.  The path just admitted three.  Mr. Darcy felt\ntheir rudeness, and immediately said:",
        "“This walk is not wide enough for our party.  We had better go\ninto the avenue.”",
        "But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with\nthem, laughingly answered:",
        "“No, no; stay where you are.  You are charmingly grouped, and\nappear to uncommon advantage.  The picturesque would be\nspoilt by admitting a fourth.  Good-bye.”",
        "She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the\nhope of being at home again in a day or two.  Jane was already\nso much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of\nhours that evening.",
