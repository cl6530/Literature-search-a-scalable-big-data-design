        "Every one who has read the late Mr. R.D. Blackmore’s Lorna Doone has a\nkeen interest in what is frequently called the Doone Country. This\ncomprises the north-west corner of Exmoor, bordering on the boundaries\nof Devonshire. But those who visit the little village of Oare and\nBadgworthy Water must not expect to see all that the novelist’s\nimagination conjured up. Nevertheless, though some have been\ndisappointed, there is much to be seen which is of interest. The church\nat Oare, for instance, is closely associated with John Ridd and Lorna,\nand the Snowe family, mentioned by the novelist, are commemorated in the\nchurch. Then, too, the feats of a “Great John Ridd” are obscurely\ntraditional in the district.",
        "The Doone valley, with Badgworthy (pronounced Badgery_) Water running\nthrough it, is about half-an-hour’s walk from Malmsmead Bridge, which is\nclose to the village of Oare. Keeping up the course of the stream one\nreaches a wood of oaks, and near it one finds a tributary of the brook\nfalling down a series of miniature cascades. This is the “water slide\"\nup which Blackmore took his hero on the occasion of his first meeting\nwith Lorna Doone. If one crosses a bridge near this the path will be\nfound to continue for about a mile. At this distance one turns to the\nright by another stream, and enters a combe containing the ruins of the\nDoone Houses as they are called. A lonely cottage looks down upon all\nthat is to be seen of the famous stronghold of the Doones. The narrow\napproach to the place never existed outside the pages of the romance.\nThe scenery of this portion of Exmoor is exceedingly wild.",
