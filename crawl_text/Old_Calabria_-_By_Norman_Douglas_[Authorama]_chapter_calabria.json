        "I find it hard to sum up in one word the character of Lucera–the effect\nit produces on the mind; one sees so many towns that the freshness of\ntheir images becomes blurred. The houses are low but not undignified;\nthe streets regular and clean; there is electric light and somewhat\nindifferent accommodation for travellers; an infinity of barbers and\nchemists. Nothing remarkable in all this. Yet the character is there, if\none could but seize upon it, since every place has its genius. Perhaps\nit lies in a certain feeling of aloofness that never leaves one here. We\nare on a hill–a mere wave of ground; a kind of spur, rather, rising up\nfrom, the south–quite an absurd little hill, but sufficiently high to\ndominate the wide Apulian plain. And the nakedness of the land\nstimulates this aerial sense. There are some trees in the “Belvedere” or\npublic garden that lies on the highest part of the spur and affords a\nfine view north and eastwards. But the greater part were only planted a\nfew years ago, and those stretches of brown earth, those half-finished\nwalks and straggling pigmy shrubs, give the place a crude and embryonic\nappearance. One thinks that the designers might have done more in the\nway of variety; there are no conifers excepting a few cryptomerias and\nyews which will all be dead in a couple of years, and as for those\nyuccas, beloved of Italian municipalities, they will have grown more\ndyspeptic-looking than ever. None the less, the garden will be a\npleasant spot when the ilex shall have grown higher; even now it is the\nfavourite evening walk of the citizens. Altogether, these public parks,\nwhich are now being planted all over south Italy, testify to renascent\ntaste; they and the burial-places are often the only spots where the\ndeafened and light-bedazzled stranger may find a little green\ncontent; the content, respectively, of L’Allegro and Il Penseroso.\nSo the cemetery of Lucera, with its ordered walks drowned in the shade\nof cypress–roses and gleaming marble monuments in between–is a\ncharming retreat, not only for the dead.",
        "The Belvedere, however, is not my promenade. My promenade lies yonder,\non the other side of the valley, where the grave old Suabian castle sits\non its emerald slope. It does not frown; it reposes firmly, with an air\nof tranquil and assured domination; “it has found its place,” as an\nItalian observed to me. Long before Frederick Barbarossa made it the\ncentre of his southern dominions, long before the Romans had their\nfortress on the site, this eminence must have been regarded as the key\nof Apulia. All round the outside of those turreted walls (they are\nnearly a mile in circumference; the enclosure, they say, held sixty\nthousand people) there runs a level space. This is my promenade, at all\nhours of the day. Falcons are fluttering with wild cries overhead; down\nbelow, a long unimpeded vista of velvety green, flecked by a few trees\nand sullen streamlets and white farmhouses–the whole vision framed in a\nring of distant Apennines. The volcanic cone of Mount Vulture, land of\nHorace, can be detected on clear days; it tempts me to explore those\nregions. But eastward rises up the promontory of Mount Gargano, and on\nthe summit of its nearest hill one perceives a cheerful building, some\nvillage or convent, that beckons imperiously across the intervening\nlowlands. Yonder lies the venerable shrine of the archangel Michael, and\nManfred’s town. . . .",
        "This castle being a national monument, they have appointed a custodian\nto take charge of it; a worthless old fellow, full of untruthful\ninformation which he imparts with the hushed and conscience-stricken air\nof a man who is selling State secrets.",
        "“That corner tower, sir, is the King’s tower. It was built by the King.”",
        "“But you said just now that it was the Queen’s tower.”",
        "“So it is. The Queen–she built it.”",
        "“What Queen?”",
        "“What Queen? Why, the Queen–the Queen the German professor was talking\nabout three years ago. But I must show you some skulls which we found\n(sotto voce) in a subterranean crypt. They used to throw the poor dead\nfolk in here by hundreds; and under the Bourbons the criminals were\nhanged here, thousands of them. The blessed times! And this tower is the\nQueen’s tower.”",
        "“But you called it the King’s tower just now.”",
        "“Just so. That is because the King built it.”",
        "“What King?”",
        "“Ah, sir, how can I remember the names of all those gentlemen? I haven’t\nso much as set eyes on them! But I must now show you some round\nsling-stones which we excavated (sotto voce) in a subterranean crypt-----”",
        "One or two relics from this castle are preserved in the small municipal\nmuseum, founded about five years ago. Here are also a respectable\ncollection of coins, a few prehistoric flints from Gargano, some quaint\nearly bronze figurines and mutilated busts of Roman celebrities carved\nin marble or the recalcitrant local limestone. A dignified old lion–one\nof a pair (the other was stolen) that adorned the tomb of Aurelius,\nprastor of the Roman Colony of Luceria–has sought a refuge here, as\nwell as many inscriptions, lamps, vases, and a miscellaneous collection\nof modern rubbish. A plaster cast of a Mussulman funereal stone, found\nnear Foggia, will attract your eye; contrasted with the fulsome epitaphs\nof contemporary Christianity, it breathes a spirit of noble resignation:–",
        "“In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate. May God show\nkindness to Mahomet and his kinsfolk, fostering them by his favours!\nThis is the tomb of the captain Jacchia Albosasso. God be merciful to\nhim. He passed away towards noon on Saturday in the five days of the\nmonth Moharram of the year 745 (5th April, 1348). May Allah likewise\nshow mercy to him who reads.”",
        "One cannot be at Lucera without thinking of that colony of twenty\nthousand Saracens, the escort of Frederick and his son, who lived here\nfor nearly eighty years, and sheltered Manfred in his hour of danger.\nThe chronicler Spinelli [Footnote: These journals are now admitted to\nhave been manufactured in the sixteenth century by the historian\nCostanze for certain genealogical purposes of his own. Professor\nBernhard! doubted their authenticity in 1869, and his doubts have been\nconfirmed by Capasse.] has preserved an anecdote which shows Manfred’s\ninfatuation for these loyal aliens. In the year 1252 and in the\nsovereign’s presence, a Saracen official gave a blow to a Neapolitan\nknight–a blow which was immediately returned; there was a tumult, and\nthe upshot of it was that the Italian was condemned to lose his hand;\nall that the Neapolitan nobles could obtain from Manfred was that his\nleft hand should be amputated instead of his right; the Arab, the cause\nof all, was merely relieved of his office. Nowadays, all memory of\nSaracens has been swept out of the land. In default of anything better,\nthey are printing a local halfpenny paper called “II Saraceno\"–a very\ninnocuous pagan, to judge by a copy which I bought in a reckless moment.",
        "This museum also contains a buxom angel of stucco known as the “Genius\nof Bourbonism.” In the good old days it used to ornament the town hall,\nfronting the entrance; but now, degraded to a museum curiosity, it\npresents to the public its back of ample proportions, and the curator\nintimated that he considered this attitude quite appropriate–\nhistorically speaking, of course. Furthermore, they have carted\nhither, from the Chamber of Deputies in Rome, the chair once\noccupied by Ruggiero Bonghi. Dear Bonghi! From a sense of duty he used\nto visit a certain dull and pompous house in the capital and forthwith\nfall asleep on the nearest sofa; he slept sometimes for two hours at a\nstretch, while all the other visitors were solemnly marched to the spot\nto observe him–behold the great Bonghi: he slumbers! There is a statue\nerected to him here, and a street has likewise been named after another\ncelebrity, Giovanni Bovio. If I informed the townsmen of my former\nacquaintance with these two heroes, they would perhaps put up a marble\ntablet commemorating the fact. For the place is infected with the\npatriotic disease of monumentomania. The drawback is that with every\nchange of administration the streets are re-baptized and the statues\nshifted to make room for new favourites; so the civic landmarks come and\ngo, with the swiftness of a cinematograph.",
        "Frederick II also has his street, and so has Pietjo Giannone. This\nsmacks of anti-clericalism. But to judge by the number of priests and\nthe daily hordes of devout and dirty pilgrims that pour into the town\nfrom the fanatical fastnesses of the Abruzzi–picturesque, I suppose we\nshould call them–the country is sufficiently orthodox. Every\nself-respecting family, they tell me, has its pet priest, who lives on\nthem in return for spiritual consolations.",
        "There was a religious festival some nights ago in honour of Saint\nEspedito. No one could tell me more about this holy man than that he was\na kind of pilgrim-warrior, and that his cult here is of recent date; it\nwas imported or manufactured some four years ago by a rich merchant who,\ntired of the old local saints, built a church in honour of this new one,\nand thereby enrolled him among the city gods.",
        "On this occasion the square was seething with people: few\nwomen, and the men mostly in dark clothes; we are already under Moorish\nand Spanish influences. A young boy addressed me with the polite\nquestion whether I could tell him the precise number of the population\nof London.",
        "That depended, I said, on what one described as London. There was what\nthey called greater London–",
        "It depended! That was what he had always been given to understand. . . .\nAnd how did I like Lucera? Rather a dull little place, was it not?\nNothing like Paris, of course. Still, if I could delay my departure for\nsome days longer, they would have the trial of a man who had murdered\nthree people: it might be quite good fun. He was informed that they\nhanged such persons in England, as they used to do hereabouts; it seemed\nrather barbaric, because, naturally, nobody is ever responsible for his\nactions; but in England, no doubt–",
        "That is the normal attitude of these folks towards us and our\ninstitutions. We are savages, hopeless savages; but a little savagery,\nafter all, is quite endurable. Everything is endurable if you have lots\nof money, like these English.",
        "As for myself, wandering among that crowd of unshaven creatures, that\nrustic population, fiercely gesticulating and dressed in slovenly hats\nand garments, I realized once again what the average Anglo-Saxon would\nask himself: Are they all brigands, or only some of them? That music,\ntoo–what is it that makes this stuff so utterly unpalatable to a\ncivilized northerner? A soulless cult of rhythm, and then, when the\nsimplest of melodies emerges, they cling to it with the passionate\ndelight of a child who has discovered the moon. These men are still in\nthe age of platitudes, so far as music is concerned; an infantile aria\nis to them what some foolish rhymed proverb is to the Arabs: a thing of\nGod, a portent, a joy for ever.",
        "You may visit the cathedral; there is a fine verde antico column on\neither side of the sumptuous main portal. I am weary, just now, of these\nstructures; the spirit of pagan Lucera–\"Lucera dei Pagani” it used to\nbe called–has descended upon me; I feel inclined to echo Carducci’s\n”Addio, nume semitico!” One sees so many of these sombre churches,\nand they are all alike in their stony elaboration of mysticism and\nwrong-headedness; besides, they have been described, over and over\nagain, by enthusiastic connaisseurs who dwell lovingly upon their\nartistic quaintnesses but forget the grovelling herd that reared them,\nwith the lash at their backs, or the odd type of humanity–the gargoyle\ntype–that has since grown up under their shadow and influence.\nI prefer to return to the sun and stars, to my promenade beside\nthe castle walls.",
        "But for the absence of trees and hedges, one might take this to be some\nEnglish prospect of the drowsy Midland counties–so green it is, so\ngolden-grey the sky. The sunlight peers down dispersedly through windows\nin this firmament of clouded amber, alighting on some mouldering tower,\nsome patch of ripening corn or distant city–Troia, lapped in Byzantine\nslumber, or San Severo famed in war. This in spring. But what days of\nglistering summer heat, when the earth is burnt to cinders under a\nheavenly dome that glows like a brazier of molten copper! For this\ncountry is the Sahara of Italy.",
        "One is glad, meanwhile, that the castle does not lie in the natal land\nof the Hohenstaufen. The interior is quite deserted, to be sure; they\nhave built half the town of Lucera with its stones, even as Frederick\nquarried them out of the early Roman citadel beneath; but it is at least\na harmonious desolation. There are no wire-fenced walks among the ruins,\nno feeding-booths and cheap reconstructions of draw-bridges and\npolice-notices at every corner; no gaudy women scribbling to their\nfriends in the “Residenzstadt” post cards illustrative of the\n\"Burgruine,” while their husbands perspire over mastodontic beer-jugs.\nThere is only peace.",
        "These are the delights of Lucera: to sit under those old walls and watch\nthe gracious cloud-shadows dappling the plain, oblivious of yonder\nassemblage of barbers and politicians. As for those who can reconstruct\nthe vanished glories of such a place–happy they! I find the task\nincreasingly difficult. One outgrows the youthful age of hero-worship;\nnext, our really keen edges are so soon worn off by mundane trivialities\nand vexations that one is glad to take refuge in simpler pleasures once\nmore–to return to primitive emotionalism. There are so many Emperors of\npast days! And like the old custodian, I have not so much as set eyes on\nthem.",
        "Yet this Frederick is no dim figure; he looms grandly through the\nintervening haze. How well one understands that craving for the East,\nnowadays; how modern they were, he and his son the “Sultan of Lucera,\"\nand their friends and counsellors, who planted this garden of exotic\nculture! Was it some afterglow of the luminous world that had sunk below\nthe horizon, or a pale streak of the coming dawn? And if you now glance\ndown into this enclosure that once echoed with the song of minstrels\nand the soft laughter of women, with the discourse of wits, artists and\nphilosophers, and the clang of arms–if you look, you will behold\nnothing but a green lake, a waving field of grass. No matter. The\nambitions of these men are fairly realized, and every one of us may keep\na body-guard of pagans, an’t please him; and a harem likewise–to judge\nby the newspapers.",
        "For he took his Orientalism seriously; he had a harem, with eunuchs,\netc., all proper, and was pleased to give an Eastern colour to his\nentertainments. Matthew Paris relates how Frederick’s brother-in-law,\nreturning from the Holy Land, rested awhile at his Italian court, and\nsaw, among other diversions, “duas puellas Saracenicas formosas, quae in\npavimenti planitie binis globis insisterent, volutisque globis huo\nillucque ferrentur canentes, cymbala manibus collidentes, corporaque\nsecundum modules motantes atque flectentes.” I wish I had been there. . . .",
        "I walked to the castle yesterday evening on the chance of seeing an\neclipse of the moon which never came, having taken place at quite\nanother hour. A cloudless night, dripping with moisture, the electric\nlights of distant Foggia gleaming in the plain. There are brick-kilns at\nthe foot of the incline, and from some pools in the neighbourhood issued\na loud croaking of frogs, while the pallid smoke of the furnaces,\npressed down by the evening dew, trailed earthward in a long twisted\nwreath, like a dragon crawling sulkily to his den. But on the north side\none could hear the nightingales singing in the gardens below. The dark\nmass of Mount Gargano rose up clearly in the moonlight, and I began to\nsketch out some itinerary of my wanderings on that soil. There was Sant’\nAngelo, the archangel’s abode; and the forest region; and Lesina with\nits lake; and Vieste the remote, the end of all things. . . .",
        "Then my thoughts wandered to the Hohenstaufen and the conspiracy whereby\ntheir fate was avenged. The romantic figures of Manfred and Conradin;\ntheir relentless enemy Charles; Costanza, her brow crowned with a poetic\nnimbus (that melted, towards the end, into an aureole of bigotry);\nFrangipani, huge in villainy; the princess Beatrix, tottering from the\ndungeon where she had been confined for nearly twenty years; her\ndeliverer Roger de Lauria, without whose resourcefulness and audacity it\nmight have gone ill with Aragon; Popes and Palaso-logus–brilliant\ncolour effects; the king of England and Saint Louis of France; in the\nbackground, dimly discernible, the colossal shades of Frederick and\nInnocent, looked in deadly embrace; and the whole congress of figures\nenlivened and interpenetrated as by some electric fluid–the personality\nof John of Procida. That the element of farce might not be lacking, Fate\ncontrived that exquisite royal duel at Bordeaux where the two mighty\npotentates, calling each other by a variety of unkingly epithets,\nenacted a prodigiously fine piece of foolery for the delectation of\nEurope.",
        "From this terrace one can overlook both Foggia and Castel\nFiorentino–the beginning and end of the drama; and one follows the\nmarch of this magnificent retribution without a shred of compassion for\nthe gloomy papal hireling. Disaster follows disaster with mathematical\nprecision, till at last he perishes miserably, consumed by rage and\ndespair. Then our satisfaction is complete.",
        "No; not quite complete. For in one point the stupendous plot seems to\nhave been imperfectly achieved. Why did Roger de Lauria not profit by\nhis victory to insist upon the restitution of the young brothers of\nBeatrix, of those unhappy princes who had been confined as infants in\n1266, and whose very existence seems to have faded from the memory of\nhistorians? Or why did Costanza, who might have dealt with her enemy’s\nson even as Conradin had been dealt with, not round her magnanimity by\nclaiming her own flesh and blood, the last scions of a great house? Why\nwere they not released during the subsequent peace, or at least in 1302?\nThe reason is as plain as it is unlovely; nobody knew what to do with\nthem. Political reasons counselled their effacement, their\nnon-existence. Horrible thought, that the sunny world should be too\nsmall for three orphan children! In their Apulian fastness they\nremained–in chains. A royal rescript of 1295 orders that they be freed\nfrom their fetters. Thirty years in fetters! Their fate is unknown; the\nnight of medievalism closes in upon them once more. . . .",
        "Further musings were interrupted by the appearance of a shape which\napproached from round the corner of one of the towers. It cams nearer\nstealthily, pausing every now and then. Had I evoked, willy-nilly, some\nphantom of the buried past?",
        "It was only the custodian, leading his dog Musolino. After a shower of\ncompliments and apologies, he gave me to understand that it was his\nduty, among other things, to see that no one should endeavour to raise\nthe treasure which was hidden under these ruins; several people, he\nexplained, had already made the attempt by night. For the rest, I was\nquite at liberty to take my pleisure about the castle at all hours. But\nas to touching the buried hoard, it was proibito–forbidden!",
        "I was glad of the incident, which conjured up for me the Oriental mood\nwith its genii and subterranean wealth. Straightway this incongruous and\nirresponsible old buffoon was invested with a new dignity; transformed\ninto a threatening Ifrit, the guardian of the gold, or–who\nknows?–Iblis incarnate. The gods take wondrous shapes, sometimes.",
        "As the train moved from Lucera to Foggia and thence onwards, I had\nenjoyed myself rationally, gazing at the emerald plain of Apulia, soon\nto be scorched to ashes, but now richly dight with the yellow flowers of\nthe giant fennel, with patches of ruby-red poppy and asphodels pale and\nshadowy, past their prime. I had thought upon the history of this\nimmense tract of country–upon all the floods of legislation and\ntheorizings to which its immemorial customs of pasturage have given\nbirth. . . .",
        "Then, suddenly, the aspect of life seemed to change. I felt unwell, and\nso swift was the transition from health that I had wantonly thrown out\nof the window, beyond recall, a burning cigar ere realizing that it was\nonly a little more than half smoked. We were crossing the Calendaro, a\nsluggish stream which carefully collects all the waters of this region\nonly to lose them again in a swamp not far distant; and it was\npositively as if some impish sprite had leapt out of those noisome\nwaves, boarded the train, and flung himself into me, after the fashion\nof the “Horla” in the immortal tale.",
        "Doses of quinine such as would make an English doctor raise his eyebrows\nhave hitherto only succeeded in provoking the Calendaro microbe to more\nvirulent activity. Nevertheless, on s’y fait. I am studying him and,\ndespite his protean manifestations, have discovered three principal\ningredients: malaria, bronchitis and hay-fever–not your ordinary\nhay-fever, oh, no! but such as a mammoth might conceivably catch, if\nthrust back from his germless, frozen tundras into the damply blossoming\nMiocene.",
        "The landlady of this establishment has a more commonplace name for the\ndistemper. She calls it “scirocco.” And certainly this pest of the south\nblows incessantly; the mountain-line of Gargano is veiled, the sea’s\nhorizon veiled, the coast-lands of Apulia veiled by its tepid and\nunwholesome breath. To cheer me up, she says that on clear days one can\nsee Castel del Monte, the Hohenstaufen eyrie, shining yonder above\nBarletta, forty miles distant. It sounds rather improbable; still,\nyesterday evening there arose a sudden vision of a white town in that\ndirection, remote and dream-like, far across the water. Was it Barletta?\nOr Margherita? It lingered awhile, poised on an errant sunbeam; then\nsank into the deep.",
        "From this window I look into the little harbour whose beach is dotted\nwith fishing-boats. Some twenty or thirty sailing-vessels are riding at\nanchor; in the early morning they unfurl their canvas and sally forth,\nin amicable couples, to scour the azure deep–it is greenish-yellow at\nthis moment–returning at nightfall with the spoils of ocean, mostly\nyoung sharks, to judge by the display in the market. Their white sails\nbear fabulous devices in golden colour of moons and crescents and\ndolphins; some are marked like the “orange-tip” butterfly. A gunboat is\nnow stationed here on a mysterious errand connected with the Albanian\nrising on the other side of the Adriatic. There has been whispered talk\nof illicit volunteering among the youth on this side, which the\ngovernment is anxious to prevent. And to enliven the scene, a steamer\ncalls every now and then to take passengers to the Tremiti islands. One\nwould like to visit them, if only in memory of those martyrs of\nBourbonism, who were sent in hundreds to these rocks and cast into\ndungeons to perish. I have seen such places; they are vast caverns\nartificially excavated below the surface of the earth; into these the\nunfortunates were lowered and left to crawl about and rot, the living\nmingled with the dead. To this day they find mouldering skeletons,\nloaded with heavy iron chains and ball-weights.",
        "A copious spring gushes up on this beach and flows into the sea. It is\nsadly neglected. Were I tyrant of Manfredonia, I would build me a fair\nmarble fountain here, with a carven assemblage of nymphs and\nsea-monsters spouting water from their lusty throats, and plashing in\nits rivulets. It may well be that the existence of this fount helped to\ndecide Manfred in his choice of a site for his city; such springs are\nrare in this waterless land. And from this same source, very likely, is\nderived the local legend of Saint Lorenzo and the Dragon, which is quite\nindependent of that of Saint Michael the dragon-killer on the heights\nabove us. These venerable water-spirits, these dracs, are interesting\nbeasts who went through many metamorphoses ere attaining their present\nshape.",
        "Manfredonia lies on a plain sloping very gently seawards–practically\na dead level, and in one of the hottest districts of Italy. Yet, for\nsome obscure reason, there is no street along the sea itself; the\ncross-roads end in abrupt squalor at the shore. One wonders what\nconsiderations–political, aesthetic or hygienic–prevented the\ndesigners of the town from carrying out its general principles of\nconstruction and building a decent promenade by the waves, where the ten\nthousand citizens could take the air in the breathless summer evenings,\ninstead of being cooped up, as they now are, within stifling hot walls.\nThe choice of Man-fredonia as a port does not testify to any great\nforesight on the part of its founder–peace to his shade! It will for\never slumber in its bay, while commerce passes beyond its reach; it will\nfor ever be malarious with the marshes of Sipontum at its edges. But\nthis particular defect of the place is not Manfred’s fault, since the\ncity was razed to the ground by the Turks in 1620, and then built up\nanew; built up, says Lenormant, according to the design of the old city.\nPerhaps a fear of other Corsair raids induced the constructors to adhere\nto the old plan, by which the place could be more easily defended. Not\nmuch of Man-fredonia seems to have been completed when Pacicchelli’s\nview (1703) was engraved.",
        "Speaking of the weather, the landlady further told me that the wind blew\nso hard three months ago–\"during that big storm in the winter, don’t\nyou remember?\"–that it broke all the iron lamp-posts between the town\nand the station. Now here was a statement sounding even more improbable\nthan her other one about Castel del Monte, but admitting of\nverification. Wheezing and sneezing, I crawled forth, and found it\ncorrect. It must have been a respectable gale, since the cast-iron\nsupports are snapped in half, every one of them.",
        "Those Turks, by the way, burnt the town on that memorable occasion. That\nwas a common occurrence in those days. Read any account of their\nincursions into Italy during this and the preceding centuries, and you\nwill find that the corsairs burnt the towns whenever they had time to\nset them alight. They could not burn them nowadays, and this points to a\ntotal change in economic conditions. Wood was cut down so heedlessly\nthat it became too scarce for building purposes, and stone took its\nplace. This has altered domestic architecture; it has changed the\nlandscape, denuding the hill-sides that were once covered with timber;\nit has impoverished the country by converting fruitful plains into\nmarshes or arid tracts of stone swept by irregular and intermittent\nfloods; it has modified, if I mistake not, the very character of the\npeople. The desiccation of the climate has entailed a desiccation of\nnational humour.",
        "Muratori has a passage somewhere in his “Antiquities” regarding the old\nmethod of construction and the wooden shingles, scandulae, in use for\nroofing–I must look it up, if ever I reach civilized regions again.",
        "At the municipality, which occupies the spacious apartments of a former\nDominican convent, they will show you the picture of a young girl, one\nof the Beccarmi family, who was carried off at a tender age in one of\nthese Turkish raids, and subsequently became “Sultana.” Such captive\ngirls generally married sultans–or ought to have married them; the wish\nbeing father to the thought. But the story is disputed; rightly, I\nthink. For the portrait is painted in the French manner, and it is\nhardly likely that a harem-lady would have been exhibited to a European\nartist. The legend goes on to say that she was afterwards liberated by\nthe Knights of Malta, together with her Turkish son who, as was meet and\nproper, became converted to Christianity and died a monk. The Beccarmi\nfamily (of Siena, I fancy) might find some traces of her in their\narchives. Ben trovato, at all events. When one looks at the pretty\nportrait, one cannot blame any kind of “Sultan” for feeling\nwell-disposed towards the original.",
        "The weather has shown some signs of improvement and tempted me, despite\nthe persistent “scirocco” mood, to a few excursions into the\nneighbourhood. But there seem to be no walks hereabouts, and the hills,\nthree miles distant, are too remote for my reduced vitality. The\nintervening region is a plain of rock carved so smoothly, in places, as\nto appear artificially levelled with the chisel; large tracts of it are\ncovered with the Indian fig (cactus). In the shade of these grotesque\ngrowths lives a dainty flora: trembling grasses of many kinds, rue,\nasphodel, thyme, the wild asparagus, a diminutive blue iris, as well as\npatches of saxifrage that deck the stone with a brilliant enamel of red\nand yellow. This wild beauty makes one think how much better the\ngraceful wrought-iron balconies of the town would look if enlivened with\nblossoms, with pendent carnations or pelargonium; but there is no great\ndisplay of these things; the deficiency of water is a characteristic of\nthe place; it is a flowerless and songless city. The only good\ndrinking-water is that which is bottled at the mineral springs of Monte\nVulture and sold cheaply enough all over the country. And the mass of\nthe country people have small charm of feature. Their faces seem to have\nbeen chopped with a hatchet into masks of sombre virility; a hard life\namid burning limestone deserts is reflected in their countenances.",
        "None the less, they have a public garden; even more immature than that\nof Lucera, but testifying to greater taste. Its situation, covering a\nforlorn semicircular tract of ground about the old Anjou castle, is a\npriori a good one. But when the trees are fully grown, it will be\nimpossible to see this fine ruin save at quite close quarters–just\nacross the moat.",
        "I lamented this fact to a solitary gentleman who was strolling about\nhere and who replied, upon due deliberation:",
        "“One cannot have everything.”",
        "Then he added, as a suggestive afterthought:",
        "“Inasmuch as one thing sometimes excludes another.”",
        "I pause, to observe parenthetically that this habit of uttering\nplatitudes in the grand manner as though disclosing an idea of vital\nnovelty (which Charles Lamb, poor fellow, thought peculiar to natives of\nScotland) is as common among Italians as among Englishmen. But veiled in\nsonorous Latinisms, the staleness of such remarks assumes an air of\nprofundity.",
        "“For my part,” he went on, warming to his theme, “I am thoroughly\nsatisfied. Who will complain of the trees? Only a few makers of bad\npictures. They can go elsewhere. Our country, dear sir, is encrusted,\nwith old castles and other feudal absurdities, and if I had the\nmanagement of things-----”",
        "The sentence was not concluded, for at that moment his hat was blown off\nby a violent gust of wind, and flew merrily over beds of flowering\nmarguerites in the direction of the main street, while he raced after\nit, vanishing in a cloud of dust. The chase must have been long and\narduous; he never returned.",
        "Wandering about the upper regions of this fortress whose chambers are\nnow used as a factory of cement goods and a refuge for some poor\nfamilies, I espied a good pre-renaissance relief of Saint Michael and\nthe dragon immured in the masonry, and overhung by the green leaves of\nan exuberant wild fig that has thrust its roots into the sturdy old\nwalls. Here, at Manfredonia, we are already under the shadow of the holy\nmountain and the archangel’s wings, but the usual representations of him\nare childishly emasculate–the negation of his divine and heroic\ncharacter. This one portrays a genuine warrior-angel of the old type:\ngrave and grim. Beyond this castle and the town-walls, which are best\npreserved on the north side, nothing in Manfredonia is older than 1620.\nThere is a fine campanile, but the cathedral looks like a shed for\ndisused omnibuses.",
        "Along the streets, little red flags are hanging out of the houses, at\nfrequent intervals: signals of harbourage for the parched wayfarer.\nWithin, you behold a picturesque confusion of rude chairs set among\nbarrels and vats full of dark red wine where, amid Rembrandtesque\nsurroundings, you can get as drunk as a lord for sixpence. Blithe oases!\nIt must be delightful, in summer, to while away the sultry hours in\ntheir hospitable twilight; even at this season they seem to be extremely\npopular resorts, throwing a new light on those allusions by classical\nauthors to “thirsty Apulia.”",
        "But on many of the dwellings I noticed another symbol: an ominous blue\nmetal tablet with a red cross, bearing the white-lettered words\n\"VIGILANZA NOTTURNA.”",
        "Was it some anti-burglary association? I enquired of a serious-looking\nindividual who happened to be passing.",
        "His answer did not help to clear up matters.",
        "“A pure job, signore mio, a pure job! There is a society in Cerignola\nor somewhere, a society which persuades the various town\ncouncils–persuades them, you understand-----”",
        "He ended abruptly, with the gesture of paying out money between his\nfinger and thumb. Then he sadly shook his head.",
        "I sought for more light on this cryptic utterance; in vain. What were\nthe facts, I persisted? Did certain householders subscribe to keep a\nguardian on their premises at night–what had the municipalities to do\nwith it–was there much house-breaking in Manfredonia, and, if so, had\nthis association done anything to check it? And for how long had the\ninstitution been established?",
        "But the mystery grew ever darker. After heaving a deep sigh, he\ncondescended to remark:",
        "“The usual camorra! Eat–eat; from father to son. Eat–eat! That’s all\nthey think about, the brood of assassins. . . . Just look at them!”",
        "I glanced down the street and beheld a venerable gentleman of kindly\naspect who approached slowly, leaning on the arm of a fair-haired\nyouth–his grandson, I supposed. He wore a long white beard, and an air\nof apostolic detachment from the affairs of this world. They came\nnearer. The boy was listening, deferentially, to some remark of the\nelder; his lips were parted in attention and his candid, sunny face\nwould have rejoiced the heart of della Robbia. They passed within a few\nfeet of me, lovingly engrossed in one another.",
        "“Well?” I queried, turning to my informant and anxious to learn what\nmisdeeds could be laid to the charge of such godlike types of humanity.",
        "But that person was no longer at my side. He had quietly withdrawn\nhimself, in the interval; he had evanesced, “moved on.”",
        "An oracular and elusive citizen. ...",
        "Whoever looks at a map of the Gargano promontory will see that it is\nbesprinkled with Greek names of persons and places–Matthew, Mark,\nNikander, Onofrius, Pirgiano (Pyrgos) and so forth. Small wonder, for\nthese eastern regions were in touch with Constantinople from early days,\nand the spirit of Byzance still hovers over them. It was on this\nmountain that the archangel Michael, during his first flight to Western\nEurope, deigned to appear to a Greek bishop of Sipontum, Laurentius by\nname; and ever since that time a certain cavern, sanctified by the\npresence of this winged messenger of God, has been the goal of millions\nof pilgrims.",
        "The fastness of Sant’ Angelo, metropolis of European angel-worship, has\ngrown up around this “devout and honourable cave\"; on sunny days its\nhouses are clearly visible from Man-fredonia. They who wish to pay their\ndevotions at the shrine cannot do better than take with them\nGregorovius, as cicerone and mystagogue.",
        "Vainly I waited for a fine day to ascend the heights. At last I\ndetermined to have done with the trip, be the weather what it might. A\ncoachman was summoned and negotiations entered upon for starting next\nmorning.",
        "Sixty-five francs, he began by telling me, was the price paid by an\nEnglishman last year for a day’s visit to the sacred mountain. It may\nwell be true–foreigners will do anything, in Italy. Or perhaps it was\nonly said to “encourage” me. But I am rather hard to encourage,\nnowadays. I reminded the man that there was a diligence service there\nand back for a franc and a half, and even that price seemed rather\nextortionate. I had seen so many holy grottos in my life! And who, after\nall, was this Saint Michael? The Eternal Father, perchance? Nothing of\nthe kind: just an ordinary angel! We had dozens of them, in England.\nFortunately, I added, I had already received an offer to join one of the\nprivate parties who drive up, fourteen or fifteen persons behind\none diminutive pony–and that, as he well knew, would be a matter of\nonly a few pence. And even then, the threatening sky . . . Yes, on\nsecond thoughts, it was perhaps wisest to postpone the excursion\naltogether. Another day, if God wills! Would he accept this cigar as a\nrecompense for his trouble in coming?",
        "In dizzy leaps and bounds his claims fell to eight francs. It was the\ntobacco that worked the wonder; a gentleman who will give something for\nnothing (such was his logic)–well, you never know what you may not get\nout of him. Agree to his price, and chance it!",
        "He consigned the cigar to his waistcoat pocket to smoke after dinner,\nand departed–vanquished, but inwardly beaming with bright anticipation.",
        "A wretched morning was disclosed as I drew open the shutters–gusts of\nrain and sleet beating against the window-panes. No matter: the carriage\nstood below, and after that customary and hateful apology for breakfast\nwhich suffices to turn the thoughts of the sanest man towards themes of\nsuicide and murder–when will southerners learn to eat a proper\nbreakfast at proper hours?–we started on our journey. The sun came out\nin visions of tantalizing briefness, only to be swallowed up again in\ndriving murk, and of the route we traversed I noticed only the old stony\ntrack that cuts across the twenty-one windings of the new carriage-road\nhere and there. I tried to picture to myself the Norman princes, the\nemperors, popes, and other ten thousand pilgrims of celebrity crawling\nup these rocky slopes–barefoot–on such a day as this. It must have\ntried the patience even of Saint Francis of Assisi, who pilgrimaged with\nthe rest of them and, according to Pontanus, performed a little miracle\nhere en passant, as was his wont.",
        "After about three hours’ driving we reached the town of Sant’ Angelo. It\nwas bitterly cold at this elevation of 800 metres. Acting on the advice\nof the coachman, I at once descended into the sanctuary; it would be\nwarm down there, he thought. The great festival of 8 May was over, but\nflocks of worshippers were still arriving, and picturesquely pagan they\nlooked in grimy, tattered garments–their staves tipped with\npine-branches and a scrip.",
        "In the massive bronze doors of the chapel, that were made at\nConstantinople in 1076 for a rich citizen of Amalfi, metal rings are\ninserted; these, like a true pilgrim, you must clash furiously, to call\nthe attention of the Powers within to your visit; and on issuing, you\nmust once more knock as hard as you can, in order that the consummation\nof your act of worship may be duly reported: judging by the noise made,\nthe deity must be very hard of hearing. Strangely deaf they are,\nsometimes.",
        "The twenty-four panels of these doors are naively encrusted with\nrepresentations, in enamel, of angel-apparitions of many kinds; some of\nthem are inscribed, and the following is worthy of note:",
        "“I beg and implore the priests of Saint Michael to cleanse these gates\nonce a year as I have now shown them, in order that they may be always\nbright and shining.” The recommendation has plainly not been carried out\nfor a good many years past.",
        "Having entered the portal, you climb down a long stairway amid swarms of\npious, foul clustering beggars to a vast cavern, the archangel’s abode.\nIt is a natural recess in the rock, illuminated by candles. Here divine\nservice is proceeding to the accompaniment of cheerful operatic airs\nfrom an asthmatic organ; the water drops ceaselessly from the rocky\nvault on to the devout heads of kneeling worshippers that cover the\nfloor, lighted candle in hand, rocking themselves ecstatically and\ndroning and chanting. A weird scene, in truth. And the coachman was\nquite right in his surmise as to the difference in temperature. It is\nhot down here, damply hot, as in an orchid-house. But the aroma cannot\nbe described as a floral emanation: it is the bouquet, rather, of\nthirteen centuries of unwashed and perspiring pilgrims. “TERRIBILIS EST\nLOCUS ISTE,” says an inscription over the entrance of the shrine. Very\ntrue. In places like this one understands the uses, and possibly the\norigin, of incense.",
        "I lingered none the less, and my thoughts went back to the East, whence\nthese mysterious practices are derived. But an Oriental crowd of\nworshippers does not move me like these European masses of fanaticism; I\ncan never bring myself to regard without a certain amount of disquietude\nsuch passionate pilgrims. Give them their new Messiah, and all our\npainfully accumulated art and knowledge, all that reconciles civilized\nman to earthly existence, is blown to the winds. Society can deal with\nits criminals. Not they, but fond enthusiasts such as these, are the\nmenace to its stability. Bitter reflections; but then–the drive upward\nhad chilled my human sympathies, and besides–that so-called breakfast.\n. . .",
        "The grovelling herd was left behind. I ascended the stairs and,\nprofiting by a gleam of sunshine, climbed up to where, above the town,\nthere stands a proud aerial ruin known as the “Castle of\nthe Giant.” On one of its stones is inscribed the date 1491–a certain\nQueen of Naples, they say, was murdered within those now crumbling\nwalls. These sovereigns were murdered in so many castles that one\nwonders how they ever found time to be alive at all. The structure is a\nwreck and its gateway closed up; nor did I feel any great inclination,\nin that icy blast of wind, to investigate the roofless interior.",
        "I was able to observe, however, that this “feudal absurdity” bears a\nnumber like any inhabited house of Sant’ Angelo–it is No. 3.",
        "This is the latest pastime of the Italian Government: to re-number\ndwellings throughout the kingdom; and not only human habitations, but\nwalls, old ruins, stables, churches, as well as an occasional door-post\nand window. They are having no end of fun over the game, which promises\nto keep them amused for any length of time–in fact, until the next\ncraze is invented. Meanwhile, so long as the fit lasts, half a million\nbright-eyed officials, burning with youthful ardour, are employed in\naffixing these numerals, briskly entering them into ten times as many\nnote-books and registering them into thousands of municipal archives,\nall over the country, for some inscrutable but hugely important\nadministrative purposes. “We have the employes,” as a Roman deputy once\ntold me, “and therefore: they must find some occupation.”",
        "Altogether, the weather this day sadly impaired my appetite for research\nand exploration. On the way to the castle I had occasion to admire the\nfine tower and to regret that there seemed to exist no coign of vantage\nfrom which it could fairly be viewed; I was struck, also, by the number\nof small figures of Saint Michael of an ultra-youthful, almost\ninfantile, type; and lastly, by certain clean-shaven old men of the\nplace. These venerable and decorative brigands–for such they would have\nbeen, a few years ago–now stood peacefully at their thresholds, wearing\na most becoming cloak of thick brown wool, shaped like a burnous. The\ngarment interested me; it may be a legacy from the Arabs who dominated\nthis region for some little time, despoiling the holy sanctuary and\nleaving their memory to be perpetuated by the neighbouring “Monte\nSaraceno.” The costume, on the other hand, may have come over from\nGreece; it is figured on Tanagra statuettes and worn by modern Greek\nshepherds. By Sardinians, too. ... It may well be a primordial form of\nclothing with mankind.",
        "The view from this castle must be superb on clear days. Standing there,\nI looked inland and remembered all the places I had intended to\nsee–Vieste, and Lesina with its lakes, and Selva Umbra, whose very name\nis suggestive of dewy glades; how remote they were, under such\ndispiriting clouds! I shall never see them. Spring hesitates to smile\nupon these chill uplands; we are still in the grip of winter–",
        "so sang old Horace, of Garganian winds. I scanned the horizon, seeking\nfor his Mount Vulture, but all that region was enshrouded in a grey\ncurtain of vapour; only the Stagno Salso–a salt mere wherein Candelaro\nforgets his mephitic waters–shone with a steady glow, like a sheet of\npolished lead.",
        "Soon the rain fell once more and drove me to seek refuge among the\nhouses, where I glimpsed the familiar figure of my coachman, sitting\ndisconsolately under a porch. He looked up and remarked (for want of\nsomething better to say) that he had been searching for me all over the\ntown, fearing that some mischief might have happened to me. I was\ntouched by these words; touched, that is, by his child-like simplicity\nin imagining that he could bring me to believe a statement of such\nradiant improbability; so touched, that I pressed a franc into his\nreluctant palm and bade him buy with it something to eat. A whole franc.\n. . . Aha! he doubtless thought, my theory of the gentleman: it\nbegins to work.",
        "It was barely midday. Yet I was already surfeited with the angelic\nmetropolis, and my thoughts began to turn in the direction of\nManfredonia once more. At a corner of the street, however, certain\nfluent vociferations in English and Italian, which nothing would induce\nme to set down here, assailed my ears, coming up–apparently–out of the\nbowels of the earth. I stopped to listen, shocked to hear ribald\nlanguage in a holy town like this; then, impelled by curiosity,\ndescended a long flight of steps and found myself in a subterranean\nwine-cellar. There was drinking and card-playing going on here among a\nparty of emigrants–merry souls; a good half of them spoke English and,\ndespite certain irreverent phrases, they quickly won my heart with a\n\"Here! You drink this, mister.”",
        "This dim recess was an instructive pendant to the archangel’s cavern. A\nnew type of pilgrim has been evolved; pilgrims who think no more of\ncrossing to Pittsburg than of a drive to Manfredonia. But their cave was\npermeated with an odour of spilt wine and tobacco-smoke instead of the\nsubtle Essence des pelerins aes Abruzzes fleuris, and alas, the\nobject of their worship was not the Chaldean angel, but another and\nequally ancient eastern shape: Mammon. They talked much of dollars; and\nI also heard several unorthodox allusions to the “angel-business,” which\nwas described as “played out,” as well as a remark to the effect that\n\"only damn-fools stay in this country.” In short, these men were at the\nother end of the human scale; they were the strong, the energetic; the\nruthless, perhaps; but certainly–the intelligent.",
        "And all the while the cup circled round with genial iteration, and it\nwas universally agreed that, whatever the other drawbacks of Sant’\nAngelo might be, there was nothing to be said against its native liquor.",
        "It was, indeed, a divine product; a vino di montagna of noble\npedigree. So I thought, as I laboriously scrambled up the stairs once\nmore, solaced by this incident of the competition-grotto and slightly\ngiddy, from the tobacco-smoke. And here, leaning against the door-post,\nstood the coachman who had divined my whereabouts by some dark masonic\nintuition of sympathy. His face expanded into an inept smile, and I\nquickly saw that instead of fortifying his constitution with sound food,\nhe had tried alcoholic methods of defence against the inclement weather.\nJust a glass of wine, he explained. “But,” he added, “the horse is\nperfectly sober.”",
        "That quadruped was equal to the emergency. Gloriously indifferent to our\nfates, we glided down, in a vertiginous but masterly vol-plane, from the\nsomewhat objectionable mountain-town.",
        "An approving burst of sunshine greeted our arrival on the plain.",
        "Why has the exalted archangel chosen for an abode this reeking cell,\nrather than some well-built temple in the sunshine? “As symbolizing a\nray of light that penetrates into the gloom,” so they will tell you. It\nis more likely that he entered it as an extirpating warrior, to oust\nthat heathen shape which Strabo describes as dwelling in its dank\nrecesses, and to take possession of the cleft in the name of\nChristianity. Sant’ Angelo is one of many places where Michael has\nperformed the duty of Christian Hercules, cleanser of Augean stables.",
        "For the rest, this cave-worship is older than any god or devil. It is\nthe cult of the feminine principle–a relic of that aboriginal obsession\nof mankind to shelter in some Cloven Rock of Ages, in the sacred womb of\nMother Earth who gives us food and receives us after death.\nGrotto-apparitions, old and new, are but the popular explanations of\nthis dim primordial craving, and hierophants of all ages have understood\nthe commercial value of the holy shudder which penetrates in these\ncaverns to the heart of worshippers, attuning them to godly deeds. So\nhere, close beside the altar, the priests are selling fragments of the\nso-called “Stone of Saint Michael.” The trade is brisk.",
        "The statuette of the archangel preserved in this subterranean chapel is\na work of the late Renaissance. Though savouring of that mawkish\nelaboration which then began to taint local art and literature and is\nbound up with the name of the poet Marino, it is still a passably virile\nfigure. But those countless others, in churches or over house-doors–do\nthey indeed portray the dragon-killer, the martial prince of angels?\nThis amiable child with girlish features–can this be the Lucifer of\nChristianity, the Sword of the Almighty? Quis ut Deus! He could\nhardly hurt a fly.",
        "The hoary winged genius of Chaldea who has absorbed the essence of so\nmany solemn deities has now, in extreme old age, entered upon a second\nchildhood and grown altogether too youthful for his role, undergoing\na metimorphosis beyond the boundaries of legendary probability or common\nsense; every trace of divinity and manly strength has been boiled out of\nhim. So young and earthly fair, he looks, rather, like some pretty boy\ndressed up for a game with toy sword and helmet–one wants to have a\nromp with him. No warrior this! C’est beau, mais ce n’est pas la\nguerre.",
        "The gods, they say, are ever young, and a certain sensuous and fleshly\nnote is essential to those of Italy if they are to retain the love of\ntheir worshippers. Granted. We do not need a scarred and hirsute\nveteran; but we need, at least, a personage capable of wielding the\nsword, a figure something like this:–",
        "His starry helm unbuckled show’d his prime In manhood where youth ended;\nby his side As in a glist’ring zodiac hung the sword, Satan’s dire\ndread, and in his hand the spear. . . .",
        "There! That is an archangel of the right kind.",
        "And the great dragon, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, has\nsuffered a similar transformation. He is shrunk into a poor little\nreptile, the merest worm, hardly worth crushing.",
        "But how should a sublime conception like the apocalyptic hero appeal to\nthe common herd? These formidable shapes emerge from the dusk, offspring\nof momentous epochs; they stand aloof at first, but presently their\nluminous grandeur is dulled, their haughty contour sullied and\nobliterated by attrition. They are dragged down to the level of their\nlowest adorers, for the whole flock adapts its pace to that of the\nweakest lamb. No self-respecting deity will endure this treatment–to be\npopularized and made intelligible to a crowd. Divinity comprehended of\nthe masses ceases to be efficacious; the Egyptians and Brahmans\nunderstood that. It is not giving gods a chance to interpret them in an\nincongruous and unsportsmanlike fashion. But the vulgar have no idea of\npropriety or fair play; they cannot keep at the proper distance; they\nare for ever taking liberties. And, in the end, the proudest god is\nforced to yield.",
        "We see this same fatality in the very word Cherub. How different an\nimage does this plump and futile infant evoke to the stately Minister of\nthe Lord, girt with a sword of flame! We see it in the Italian Madonna\nof whom, whatever her mental acquirements may have been, a certain\ngravity of demeanour is to be presupposed, and who, none the less, grows\nmore childishly smirking every day; in her Son who–hereabouts at\nleast–has doffed all the serious attributes of manhood and dwindled\ninto something not much better than a doll. It was the same in days of\nold. Apollo (whom Saint Michael has supplanted), and Eros, and\nAphrodite–they all go through a process of saccharine deterioration.\nOur fairest creatures, once they have passed their meridian vigour, are\nliable to be assailed and undermined by an insidious diabetic tendency.",
        "It is this coddling instinct of mankind which has reduced Saint Michael\nto his present state. And an extraneous influence has worked in the same\ndirection–the gradual softening of manners within historical times,\nthat demasculinization which is an inevitable concomitant of increasing\nsocial security. Divinity reflects its human creators and their\nenvironment; grandiose or warlike gods become superfluous, and finally\nincomprehensible, in humdrum days of peace. In order to survive, our\ndeities (like the rest of us) must have a certain plasticity. If\nrecalcitrant, they are quietly relieved of their functions, and\nforgotten. This is what has happened in Italy to God the Father and the\nHoly Ghost, who have vanished from the vulgar Olympus; whereas the\ndevil, thanks to that unprincipled versatility for which he is famous,\nremains ever young and popular.",
        "The art-notions of the Cinque-Cento are also to blame; indeed, so far as\nthe angelic shapes of south Italy are concerned, the influence of the\nRenaissance has been wholly malefic. Aliens to the soil, they were at\nfirst quite unknown–not one is pictured in the Neapolitan catacombs.\nNext came the brief period of their artistic glory; then the syncretism\nof the Renaissance, when these winged messengers were amalgamated with\npagan amoretti and began to flutter in foolish baroque fashion about\nthe Queen of Heaven, after the pattern of the disreputable little genii\nattendant upon a Venus of a bad school. That same instinct which\ndegraded a youthful Eros into the childish Cupid was the death-stroke to\nthe pristine dignity and holiness of angels. Nowadays, we see the\nperversity of it all; we have come to our senses and can appraise the\nmuch-belauded revival at its true worth; and our modern sculptors will\nrear you a respectable angel, a grave adolescent, according to the best\ncanons of taste–should you still possess the faith that once\nrequisitioned such works of art.",
        "We travellers acquaint ourselves with the lineage of this celestial\nMessenger, but it can hardly be supposed that the worshippers now\nswarming at his shrine know much of these things. How shall one discover\ntheir real feelings in regard to this great cave-saint and his life and\ndeeds?",
        "Well, some idea of this may be gathered from the literature sold on the\nspot. I purchased three of these modern tracts printed respectively at\nBitonto, Molfetta and Naples. The “Popular Song in honour of St. Michael\"\ncontains this verse:",
        "Ci guidi per pieta. . . . This is the Mercury-heritage. Next, the\n\"History and Miracles of St. Michael” opens with a rollicking dialogue\nin verse between the archangel and the devil concerning a soul; it ends\nwith a goodly list, in twenty-five verses, of the miracles performed by\nthe angel, such as helping women in childbirth, curing the blind, and\nother wonders that differ nothing from those wrought by humbler earthly\nsaints. Lastly, the “Novena in Onore di S. Michele Arcangelo,” printed\nin 1910 (third edition) with ecclesiastical approval, has the following\nnoteworthy paragraph on the",
        "“DEVOTION FOR THE SACRED STONES OF THE GROTTO OF ST. MICHAEL.",
        "“It is very salutary to hold in esteem the STONES which are taken from\nthe sacred cavern, partly because from immemorial times they have always\nbeen held in veneration by the faithful and also because they have been\nplaced as relics of sepulchres and altars. Furthermore, it is known that\nduring the plague which afflicted the kingdom of Naples in the year\n1656, Monsignor G. A. Puccini, archbishop of Manfredonia, recommended\nevery one to carry devoutly on his person a fragment of the sacred\nSTONE, whereby the majority were saved from the pestilence, and this\naugmented the devotion bestowed on them.”",
        "The cholera is on the increase, and this may account for the rapid sale\nof the STONES at this moment.",
        "This pamphlet also contains a litany in which the titles of the\narchangel are enumerated. He is, among other things, Secretary of God,\nLiberator from Infernal Chains, Defender in the Hour of Death, Custodian\nof the Pope, Spirit of Light, Wisest of Magistrates, Terror of Demons,\nCommander-in-Chief of the Armies of the Lord, Lash of Heresies, Adorer\nof the Word Incarnate, Guide of Pilgrims, Conductor of Mortals: Mars,\nMercury, Hercules, Apollo, Mithra–what nobler ancestry can angel\ndesire? And yet, as if these complicated and responsible functions did\nnot suffice for his energies, he has twenty others, among them being\nthat of “Custodian of the Holy Family “–who apparently need a\nprotector, a Monsieur Paoli, like any mortal royalties.",
        "“Blasphemous rubbish!” I can hear some Methodist exclaiming. And one\nmay well be tempted to sneer at those pilgrims for the more enlightened\nof whom such literature is printed. For they are unquestionably a\nrepulsive crowd: travel-stained old women, under-studies for the Witch\nof Endor; dishevelled, anaemic and dazed-looking girls; boys, too weak\nto handle a spade at home, pathetically uncouth, with mouths agape and\neyes expressing every grade of uncontrolled emotion–from wildest joy to\ndownright idiotcy. How one realizes, down in this cavern, the effect\nupon some cultured ancient like Rutilius Namatianus of the\ncatacomb-worship among those early Christian converts, those men who\nshun the light, drawn as they were from the same social classes towards\nthe same dark underground rites! One can neither love nor respect such\npeople; and to affect pity for them would be more consonant with their\nreligion than with my own.",
        "But it is perfectly easy to understand them. For thirteen centuries this\npilgrim-movement has been going on. Thirteen centuries? No. This site\nwas an oracle in heathen days, and we know that such were frequented by\nmen not a whit less barbarous and bigoted than their modern\nrepresentatives–nothing is a greater mistake than to suppose that the\ncrowds of old Rome and Athens were more refined than our own\n(\"Demosthenes, sir, was talking to an assembly of brutes”). For thirty\ncenturies then, let us say, a deity has attracted the faithful to his\nshrine–Sant’ Angelo has become a vacuum, as it were, which must be\nperiodically filled up from the surrounding country. These pilgrimages\nare in the blood of the people: infants, they are carried there; adults,\nthey carry their own offspring; grey-beards, their tottering steps are\nstill supported by kindly and sturdier fellow-wanderers.",
        "Popes and emperors no longer scramble up these slopes; the spirit of\npiety has abated among the great ones of the earth; so much is certain.\nBut the rays of light that strike the topmost branches have not yet\npenetrated to the rank and seething undergrowth. And then–what else can\none offer to these Abruzzi mountain-folk? Their life is one of\nmiserable, revolting destitution. They have no games or sports, no\nlocal racing, clubs, cattle-shows, fox-hunting, politics, rat-catching,\nor any of those other joys that diversify the lives of our peasantry. No\ntouch of humanity reaches them, no kindly dames send them jellies or\nblankets, no cheery doctor enquires for their children; they read no\nnewspapers or books, and lack even the mild excitements of church\nversus chapel, or the vicar’s daughter’s love-affair, or the squire’s\nlatest row with his lady–nothing! Their existence is almost bestial in\nits blankness. I know them–I have lived among them. For four months in\nthe year they are cooped up in damp dens, not to be called chambers,\nwhere an Englishman would deem it infamous to keep a dog–cooped up amid\nsqualor that must be seen to be believed; for the rest of the time they\nstruggle, in the sweat of their brow, to wrest a few blades of corn from\nthe ungrateful limestone. Their visits to the archangel–these vernal\nand autumnal picnics–are their sole form of amusement.",
        "The movement is said to have diminished since the early nineties, when\nthirty thousand of them used to come here annually. It may well be the\ncase; but I imagine that this is due not so much to increasing\nenlightenment as to the depopulation caused by America; many villages\nhave recently been reduced to half their former number of inhabitants.",
        "And here they kneel, candle in hand, on the wet flags of this foetid and\nmalodorous cave, gazing in rapture upon the blandly beaming idol, their\nsensibilities tickled by resplendent priests reciting full-mouthed Latin\nphrases, while the organ overhead plays wheezy extracts from “La Forza\ndel Destino” or the Waltz out of Boito’s “Mefistofele”... for sure, it\nmust be a foretaste of Heaven! And likely enough, these are “the poor in\nheart” for whom that kingdom is reserved.",
        "One may call this a debased form of Christianity. Whether it would have\nbeen distasteful to the feelings of the founder of that cult is another\nquestion, and, debased or not, it is at least alive and palpitating,\nwhich is more than can be said of certain other varieties. But the\narchangel, as was inevitable, has suffered a sad change. His fairest\nattribute of Light-bringer, of Apollo, is no longer his own; it has been\nclaimed and appropriated by the “Light of the World,” his new master.\nOne by one, his functions have been stripped from him, all save in name,\nas happens to men and angels alike, when they take service under\n\"jealous” lords.",
        "What is now left of Saint Michael, the glittering hierarch? Can he still\nendure the light of sun? Or has he not shrivelled into a spectral\nHermes, a grisly psychopomp, bowing his head in minished glory, and\nleading men’s souls no longer aloft but downwards–down to the pale\nregions of things that have been? And will it be long ere he, too, is\nthrust by some flaming Demogorgon into these same realms of Minos, into\nthat shadowy underworld where dwell Saturn, and Kronos, and other\ncracked and shivered ideals?",
        "So I mused that afternoon, driving down the slopes from Sant’ Angelo\ncomfortably sheltered against the storm, while the generous mountain\nwine sped through my veins, warming my fancy. Then, at last, the sun\ncame out in a sudden burst of light, opening a rift in the vapours and\nrevealing the whole chain of the Apennines, together with the peaked\ncrater of Mount Vulture.",
        "The spectacle cheered me, and led me to think that such a day might\nworthily be rounded off by a visit to Sipontum, which lies a few miles\nbeyond Manfredonia on the Foggia road. But I approached the subject\ncautiously, fearing that the coachman might demur at this extra work.\nFar from it. I had gained his affection, and he would conduct me\nwhithersoever I liked. Only to Sipontum? Why not to Foggia, to Naples,\nto the ends of the earth? As for the horse, he was none the worse for\nthe trip, not a bit the worse; he liked nothing better than running in\nfront of a carriage; besides, e suo dovere– it was his duty.",
        "Sipontum is so ancient that it was founded, they say, by that legendary\nDiomed who acted in the same capacity for Beneven-tum, Arpi, and other\ncities. But this record does not satisfy Monsignor Sarnelli, its\nhistorian, according to whom it was already a flourishing town when\nShem, first son of Noah, became its king. He reigned about the year 1770\nof the creation of the world. Two years after the deluge he was 100\nyears old, and at that age begat a son Arfaxad, after whose birth he\nlived yet another five hundred years. The second king of Sipontum was\nAppulus, who ruled in the year 2213. . . . Later on, Saint Peter\nsojourned here, and baptized a few people.",
        "Of Sipontum nothing is left; nothing save a church, and even that built\nonly yesterday–in the eleventh century; a far-famed church, in the\nPisan style, with wrought marble columns reposing on lions, sculptured\ndiamond ornaments, and other crafty stonework that gladdens the eye. It\nused to be the seat of an archbishopric, and its fine episcopal chairs\nare now preserved at Sant’ Angelo; and you may still do homage to the\nauthentic Byzantine Madonna painted on wood by Saint Luke,\nbrown-complexioned, long-nosed, with staring eyes, and holding the\nInfant on her left arm. Earthquakes and Saracen incursions ruined the\ntown, which became wholly abandoned when Man-fredonia was built with its\nstones.",
        "Of pagan antiquity there are a few capitals lying about, as well as\ngranite columns in the curious old crypt. A pillar stands all forlorn in\na field; and quite close to the church are erected two others–the\nlarger of cipollino, beautified by a patina of golden lichen; a marble\nwell-head, worn half through with usage of ropes, may be found buried in\nthe rank grass. The plain whereon stood the great city of Sipus is\ncovered, now, with bristly herbage. The sea has retired from its old\nbeach, and half-wild cattle browse on the site of those lordly quays and\npalaces. Not a stone is left. Malaria and desolation reign supreme.",
        "It is a profoundly melancholy spot. Yet I was glad of the brief vision.\nI shall have fond and enduring memories of that sanctuary–the\ntravertine of its artfully carven fabric glowing orange-tawny in the\nsunset; of the forsaken plain beyond, full of ghostly phantoms of the past.",
        "As for Manfredonia–it is a sad little place, when the south wind moans\nand mountains are veiled in mists.",
        "Venosa, nowadays, lies off the beaten track. There are only three trains\na day from the little junction of Rocchetta, and they take over an hour\nto traverse the thirty odd kilometres of sparsely inhabited land. It is\nan uphill journey, for Venosa lies at a good elevation. They say that\nGerman professors, bent on Horatian studies, occasionally descend from\nthose worn-out old railway carriages; but the ordinary travellers are\neither peasant-folk or commercial gentlemen from north Italy. Worse than\nmalaria or brigandage, against both of which a man may protect himself,\nthere is no escaping from the companionship of these last-named–these\npathologically inquisitive, empty-headed, and altogether dreadful\npeople. They are the terror of the south. And it stands to reason that\nonly the most incapable and most disagreeable of their kind are sent to\nout-of-the-way places like Venosa.",
        "One asks oneself whether this town has greatly changed since Roman\ntimes. To be sure it has; domestic calamities and earthquakes (such as\nthe terrible one of 1456) have altered it beyond recognition. The\namphitheatre that seated ten thousand spectators is merged into the\nearth, and of all the buildings of Roman date nothing is left save a\npile of masonry designated as the tomb of the Marcellus who was killed\nhere by Hannibal’s soldiery, and a few reticulated walls of the second\ncentury or thereabouts known as the “House of Horace\"–as genuine as\nthat of Juliet in Verona or the Mansion of Loreto. Yet the tradition is\nan old one, and the builder of the house, whoever he was, certainly\ndisplayed some poetic taste in his selection of a fine view across the\nvalley. There is an indifferent statue of Horace in the marketplace. A\nprevious one, also described as Horace, was found to be the effigy of\nsomebody else. Thus much I learn from Lupoli’s “Iter Venusinum.”",
        "But there are ancient inscriptions galore, worked into the masonry of\nbuildings or lying about at random. Mommsen has collected numbers of\nthem in his Corpus, and since that time some sixty new ones have been\ndiscovered. And then–the stone lions of Roman days, couched forlornly\nat street corners, in courtyards and at fountains, in every stage of\ndecrepitude, with broken jaws and noses, missing legs and tails! Venosa\nis a veritable infirmary for mutilated antiques of this species. Now the\nlion is doubtless a nobly decorative beast, but–toujours perdrix! Why\nnot a few griffons or other ornaments? The Romans were not an\nimaginative race.",
        "The country around must have looked different in olden days. Horace\ndescribes it as covered with forests, and from a manuscript of the early\nseventeenth century which has lately been printed one learns that the\nsurrounding regions were full of “hares, rabbits, foxes, roe deer,\nwild boars, martens, porcupines, hedgehogs, tortoises and wolves\"–\nwood-loving creatures which have now, for the most part, deserted\nVenosa. Still, there are left some stretches of oak at the back\nof the town, and the main lines of the land cannot change. Yonder lies\nthe Horatian Forense and “Acherontia’s nest\"; further on, the glades of\nBantia (the modern Banzi); the long-drawn Garganian Mount, on which the\npoet’s eye must often have rested, emerges above the plain of Apulia\nlike an island (and such it is: an island of Austrian stone, stranded\nupon the beach of Italy). Monte Vulture still dominates the landscape,\nalthough at this nearness the crater loses its shapely conical outline\nand assumes a serrated edge. On its summit I perceive a gigantic\ncross–one of a number of such symbols which were erected by the\nclericals at the time of the recent rationalist congress in Rome.",
        "From this chronicler I learn another interesting fact: that Venosa was\nnot malarious in the author’s day. He calls it healthy, and says that\nthe only complaint from which the inhabitants suffered was “ponture\"\n(pleurisy). It is now within the infected zone. I dare say the\ndeforestation of the country, which prevented the downflow of the\nrivers–choking up their beds with detritus and producing stagnant pools\nfavourable to the breeding of the mosquito–has helped to spread the\nplague in many parts of Italy. In Horace’s days Venosa was immune,\nalthough Rome and certain rural districts were already malarious.\nAncient votive tablets to the fever-goddess Mephitis (malaria) have been\nfound not far from here, in the plain below the present city of Potenza.",
        "A good deal of old Roman blood and spirit seems to survive here. After\nthe noise of the Neapolitan provinces, where chattering takes the place\nof thinking, it is a relief to find oneself in the company of these\ngrave self-respecting folks, who really converse, like the Scotch, in\ndisinterested and impersonal fashion. Their attitude towards religious\nmatters strikes me as peculiarly Horatian; it is not active scepticism,\nbut rather a bland tolerance or what one of them described as\n\"indifferentismo\"–submission to acts of worship and all other usages\n(whatever they may be) consecrated by time: the pietas–the\nconservative, law-abiding Roman spirit. And if you walk towards sunset\nalong any of the roads leading into the country, you will meet the\npeasants riding home from their field labours accompanied by their dogs,\npigs and goats; and among them you will recognize many types of Roman\nphysiognomies–faces of orators and statesmen–familiar from old coins.\nAbout a third of the population are of the dark-fair complexion, with\nblue or green eyes. But the women are not handsome, although the town\nderives its name from Benoth (Venus). Some genuine Roman families have\ncontinued to exist to this day, such as that of Cenna (Cinna). One of\nthem was the author of the chronicle above referred to; and there is an\nantique bas-relief worked into the walls of the Trinita abbey, depicting\nsome earlier members of this local family.",
        "One is astonished how large a literature has grown up around this small\nplace–but indeed, the number of monographs dealing with every one of\nthese little Italian towns is a ceaseless source of surprise. Look below\nthe surface and you will find, in all of them, an undercurrent of keen\nspirituality–a nucleus of half a dozen widely read and thoughtful men,\nwho foster the best traditions of the mind. You will not find them in\nthe town council or at the cafe. No newspapers commend their labours, no\nmillionaires or learned societies come to their assistance, and though\ntypography is cheap in this country, they often stint themselves of the\nnecessities of life in order to produce these treatises of calm\nresearch. There is a deep gulf, here, between the mundane and the\nintellectual life. These men are retiring in their habits; and one\ncannot but revere their scholarly and almost ascetic spirit that\nsurvives like a green oasis amid the desert of “politics,” roguery and\nmunicipal corruption.",
        "The City Fathers of Venosa are reputed rich beyond the dreams of\navarice. Yet their town is by no means a clean place–it is twice as\ndirty as Lucera: a reposeful dirtiness, not vulgar or chaotic, but\ntestifying to time-honoured neglect, to a feudal contempt of\ncleanliness. You crawl through narrow, ill-paved streets, looking down\ninto subterranean family bedrooms that must be insufferably damp in\nwinter, and filled, during the hot months, with an odour hard to\nconceive. There is electric lighting, of course–a paternal government\nhaving made the price of petroleum so prohibitive that the use of\nelectricity for street-lighting became quite common in the lowliest\nplaces; but the crude glare only serves to show up the general squalor.\nOne reason for this state of affairs is that there are no quarries for\ndecent paving-stones in the neighbourhood. And another, that Venosa\npossesses no large citizen class, properly so called. The inhabitants\nare mostly peasant proprietors and field labourers, who leave the town\nin the morning and return home at night with their beasts, having\nlearned by bitter experience to take up their domiciles in the towns\nrather than in the country-side, which was infested with brigandage and\nin an unsettled state up to a short time ago. The Cincinnatus note\ndominates here, and with an agricultural population no city can be kept\nclean.",
        "But Venosa has one inestimable advantage over Lucera and most Italian\ntowns: there is no octroi.",
        "Would it be believed that Naples is surrounded by a towering Chinese\nwall, miles upon miles of it, crowned with a complicated apparatus of\nalarm-bells and patrolled night and day by a horde of doganieri armed\nto the teeth–lest some peasant should throw a bundle of onions into the\nsacred precincts of the town without paying the duty of half a farthing?\nNo nation with any sense of humour would endure this sort of thing.\nEvery one resents the airs of this army of official loafers who infest\nthe land, and would be far better employed themselves in planting onions\nupon the many miles of Italy which now lie fallow; the results of the\nsystem have been shown to be inadequate, “but,” as my friend the Roman\ndeputy once asked me, “if we dismiss these fellows from their job, how\nare we to employ them?”",
        "“Nothing is simpler,” I replied. “Enrol them into the Town Council of\nNaples. It already contains more employes than all the government\noffices of London put together; a few more will surely make no difference?”",
        "“By Bacchus,” he cried, “you foreigners have ideas! We could dispose of\nten or fifteen thousand of them, at least, in the way you suggest. I’ll\nmake a note of that, for our next session.”",
        "And so he did.",
        "But the Municipio of Naples, though extensive, is a purely local\ncharity, and I question whether its inmates will hear of any one save\ntheir own cousins and brothers-in-law figuring as colleagues in office.",
        "Every attempt at innovation in agriculture, as in industry, is forthwith\ndiscouraged by new and subtle impositions, which lie in wait for the\nenterprising Italian and punish him for his ideas. There is, of course,\na prohibitive duty on every article or implement manufactured abroad;\nthere is the octroi, a relic of medisevalism, the most unscientific,\nfutile, and vexatious of taxes; there are municipal dues to be paid on\nanimals bought and animals sold, on animals kept and animals killed, on\nmilk and vine-props and bricks, on timber for scaffolding and lead and\ntiles and wine–on every conceivable object which the peasant produces\nor requires for his existence. And one should see the faces of the\nmunicipal employes who extort these tributes. God alone knows from\nwhat classes of the populace they are recruited; certain it is that\ntheir physiognomy reflects their miserable calling. One can endure the\nmilitarism of Germany and the bureaucracy of Austria; but it is\nrevolting to see decent Italian countryfolk at the mercy of these\nuncouth savages, veritable cave-men, whose only intelligible expression\nis one of malice striving to break through a crust of congenital\ncretinism.",
        "We hear much of the great artists and speculative philosophers of old\nItaly. The artists of modern Italy are her bureaucrats who design and\nelaborate the taxes; her philosophers, the peasants who pay them.",
        "In point of method, at least, there is nothing to choose between the\nexactions of the municipal and governmental ruffians. I once saw an old\nwoman fined fifty francs for having in her possession a pound of\nsea-salt. By what logic will you make it clear to ignorant people that\nit is wrong to take salt out of the sea, whence every one takes fish\nwhich are more valuable? The waste of time employed over red tape alone\non these occasions would lead to a revolution anywhere save among men\ninured by long abuses to this particular form of tyranny. No wonder the\nwomen of the country-side, rather than waste three precious hours in\narguments about a few cheeses, will smuggle them past the authorities\nunder the device of being enceintes; no wonder their wisest old men\nregard the paternal government as a successfully organized swindle,\nwhich it is the citizen’s bounden duty to frustrate whenever possible.\nHave you ever tried to convey–in legal fashion–a bottle of wine from\none town into another; or to import, by means of a sailing-boat, an old\nfrying-pan into some village by the sea?   It is a fine art, only to be\nlearnt by years of apprenticeship. The regulations on these subjects,\nthough ineffably childish, look simple enough on paper; they take no\naccount of that “personal element” which is everything in the south, of\nthe ruffled tempers of those gorgeous but inert creatures who, disturbed\nin their siestas or mandolin-strummings, may keep you waiting half a\nday while they fumble ominously over some dirty-looking scrap of paper.\nFor on such occasions they are liable to provoking fits of\nconscientiousness. This is all very well, my dear sir, but–Ha! Where,\nwhere is that certificate of origin, that stamp, that lascia-passare?",
        "And all for one single sou!",
        "No wonder even Englishmen discover that law-breaking, in Italy, becomes\na necessity, a rule of life.",
        "And, soon enough, much more than a mere necessity. . . .",
        "For even as the traveller new to Borneo, when they offer him a\ndurian-fruit, is instantly brought to vomiting-point by its odour, but\nafter a few mouthfuls declares it to be the very apple of Paradise, and\nmarvels how he could have survived so long in the benighted lands where\nsuch ambrosial fare is not; even as the true connaisseur who, beholding\nsome rare scarlet idol from the Tingo-Tango forests, at first casts it\naside and then, light dawning as he ponders over those monstrous\ncomplexities, begins to realize that they, and they alone, contain the\nquintessential formulae of all the fervent dreamings of Scopas and\nMichelangelo; even as he who first, upon a peak in Darien, gazed\nawestruck upon the grand Pacific slumbering at his feet, till presently\nhis senses reeled at the blissful prospect of fresh regions unrolling\nthemselves, boundless, past the fulfilment of his fondest hopes--------",
        "Even so, in Italy, the domesticated Englishman is amazed to find that he\npossesses a sense hitherto unrevealed, opening up a new horizon, a new\nzest in life–the sense of law-breaking. At first, being an honest man,\nhe is shocked at the thought of such a thing; next, like a sensible\nperson, reconciled to the inevitable; lastly, as befits his virile race,\nhe learns to play the game so well that the horrified officials\ngrudgingly admit (and it is their highest praise):",
        "Yes; slowly the charm of law-breaking grows upon the Italianated Saxon;\nslowly, but surely. There is a neo-barbarism not only in matters of art.",
        "There has always, no doubt, been a castle at Venosa. Frederick\nBarbarossa lived here oftener than in Sicily; from these regions he\ncould look over to his beloved East, and the security of this particular\nkeep induced him to store his treasures therein. The indefatigable\nHuillard Breholles has excavated some account of them from the\nHohen-staufen records. Thus we learn that here, at Venosa, the Emperor\ndeposited that marvel, that tentorium, I mean, mirifica arte\nconstructum, in quo imagines solis et lunce artificialiter motte, cursum\nsuum certis et debitis spatiis peragrant, et boras diei et noctis\nin-fallibiliter indicant. Cuius tentorii valor viginti millium marcarum\npretium dicitur transcendisse. It was given him by the Sultan of\nBabylonia. Always the glowing Oriental background!",
        "The present castle, a picturesque block with moat and corner towers, was\nbuilt in 1470 by the redoubtable Pierro del Balzo. A church used to\noccupy the site, but the warrior, recognizing its strategic advantages,\ntransplanted the holy edifice to some other part of the town. It is now\na ruin, the inhabitable portions of which have been converted into cheap\nlodgings for sundry poor folk–a monetary speculation of some local\nmagnate, who paid 30,000 francs for the whole structure. You can climb\nup into one of the shattered towers whereon reposes an old cannon amid a\nwind-sown garden of shrubs and weeds. Here the jackdaws congregate at\nnightfall, flying swiftly and noiselessly to their resting-place. Odd,\nhow quiet Italian jackdaws are, compared with those of England; they\nhave discarded their voices, which is the best thing they could have\ndone in a land where every one persecutes them. There is also a dungeon\nat this castle, an underground recess with cunningly contrived\nprojections in its walls to prevent prisoners from climbing upwards; and\nother horrors.",
        "The cathedral of Venosa contains a chapel with an unusually nne portal\nof Renaissance work, but the chief architectural beauty of the town is\nthe decayed Benedictine abbey of La Trinita. The building is roofless;\nit was never completed, and the ravages of time and of man have not\nspared it; earthquakes, too, have played sad tricks with its arches and\ncolumns, particularly that of 1851, which destroyed the neighbouring\ntown of Melfi. It stands beyond the more modern settlement on what is\nnow a grassy plain, and attached to it is a Norman chapel containing the\nbones of Alberada, mother of Boemund, and others of her race. Little of\nthe original structure of this church is left, though its walls are\nstill adorned, in patches, with frescoes of genuine angels–attractive\ncreatures, as far removed from those bloodless Byzantine anatomies as\nfrom the plethoric and insipid females of the settecento. There is\nalso a queenly portrait declared to represent Catherine of Siena. I\nwould prefer to follow those who think it is meant for Sigilgaita.",
        "Small as it is, this place–the church and the abbey–is not one for a\ncasual visit. Lenormant calls the Trinita a “Musee epigra-phique\"–so\nmany are the Latin inscriptions which the monks have worked into its\nmasonry. They have encrusted the walls with them; and many antiquities\nof other kinds have been deposited here since those days. The ruin is\nstrewn with columns and capitals of fantastic devices; the inevitable\nlions, too, repose upon its grassy floor, as well as a pagan altar-stone\nthat once adorned the neighbouring amphitheatre. One thinks of the\nlabour expended in raising those prodigious blocks and fitting them\ntogether without mortar in their present positions–they, also, came\nfrom the amphitheatre, and the sturdy letterings engraved on some of\nthem formed, once upon a time, a sentence that ran round that building,\nrecording the names of its founders.",
        "Besides the Latin inscriptions, there are Hebrew funereal stones of\ngreat interest, for a colony of Jews was established here between the\nyears 400 and 800; poor folks, for the most part; no one knows whence\nthey came or whither they went. One is apt to forget that south Italy\nwas swarming with Jews for centuries. The catacombs of Venosa were\ndiscovered in 1853. Their entrance lies under a hill-side not far from\nthe modern railway station, and Professor Mueller, a lover of Venosa,\nhas been engaged for the last twenty-five years in writing a ponderous\ntome on the subject. Unfortunately (so they say) there is not much\nchance of its ever seeing the light, for just as he is on the verge of\npublication, some new Jewish catacombs are discovered in another part of\nthe world which cause the Professor to revise all his previous theories.\nThe work must be written anew and brought up to date, and hardly is this\naccomplished when fresh catacombs are found elsewhere, necessitating a\nfurther revision. The Professor once more rewrites the whole. . . .",
        "You will find accounts of the Trinita in Bertaux, Schulz and other\nwriters. Italian ones tell us what sounds rather surprising, namely,\nthat the abbey was built after a Lombard model, and not a French one. Be\nthat as it may–and they certainly show good grounds for their\ncontention–the ruin is a place of rare charm. Not easily can one see\nrelics of Roman, Hebrew and Norman life crushed into so small a space,\nwelded together by the massive yet fair architecture of the\nBenedictines, and interpenetrated, at the same time, with a\nMephistophelian spirit of modern indifference. Of cynical\ninsouciance; for although this is a “national monument,” nothing\nwhatever is done in the way of repairs. Never a month passes without\nsome richly carven block of stonework toppling down into the weeds,\n[Footnote: The process of decay can be seen by comparing my photograph\nof the east front with that taken to illustrate Giuseppe de Lorenzo’s\nmonograph “Venosa e la Regione del Vulture” (Bergamo, 1906).]\nand were it not for the zeal of a private citizen, the interior of the\nbuilding would long ago have become an impassable chaos of stones and\nshrubbery. The Trinita cannot be restored without enormous outlay;\nnobody dreams of such a thing. A yearly expenditure of ten pounds,\nhowever, would go far towards arresting its fall. But where shall the\nmoney be found? This enthusiastic nation, so enamoured of all that is\nexquisite in art, will spend sixty million francs on a new Ministry of\nJustice which, barely completed, is already showing signs of disrupture;\nit will cheerfully vote (vide daily press) the small item of eighty\nthousand francs to supply that institution with pens and ink–lucky\ncontractor!–while this and a hundred other buildings of singular beauty\nare allowed to crumble to pieces, day by day.",
        "Not far from the abbey there stands a church dedicated to Saint Roque.\nGo within, if you wish to see the difference between Benedictine dignity\nand the buffoonery which subsequently tainted the Catholicism of the\nyouth. On its gable sits a strange emblem: a large stone dog, gazing\namiably at the landscape. The saint, during his earthly career, was\nalways accompanied by a dog, and now likes to have him on the roof of\nhis sanctuary.",
        "The Norman church attached to the Trinita lies at a lower level than\nthat building, having been constructed, says Lupoli, on the foundations\nof a temple to Hymenaeus. It may be so; but one distrusts Lupoli. A\nremarkable Norman capital, now wrought into a font, is preserved here,\nand I was interested in watching the behaviour of a procession of female\npilgrims in regard to it. Trembling with emotion, they perambulated the\nsacred stone, kissing every one of its corners; then they dipped their\nhands into its basin, and kissed them devoutly. An old hag, the mistress\nof the ceremonies, muttered: “tutti santi–tutti santi!” at each\nosculation. Next, they prostrated themselves on the floor and licked\nthe cold stones, and after wallowing there awhile, rose up and began to\nkiss a small fissure in the masonry of the wall, the old woman\nwhispering, “Santissimo!” A familiar spectacle, no doubt; but one which\nnever fails of its effect. This anti-hygienic crack in the wall, with\nits suggestions of yoni-worship, attracted me so strongly that I begged\na priest to explain to me its mystical signification. But he only said,\nwith a touch of mediaeval contempt:",
        "“Sono femine!“",
        "He showed me, later on, a round Roman pillar near the entrance of the\nchurch worn smooth by the bodies of females who press themselves between\nit and the wall, in order to become mothers. The notion caused him some\namusement–he evidently thought this practice a speciality of Venosa.",
        "In my country, I said, pillars with a contrary effect would be more\npopular among the fair sex.",
        "Lear gives another account of this phallic emblem. He says that\nperambulating it hand in hand with another person, the two are sure to\nremain friends for life.",
        "This is pre-eminently a “Victorian” version.",
        "The traveller in these parts is everlastingly half-starved. Here, at\nVenosa, the wine is good–excellent, in fact; but the food monotonous\nand insufficient. This improper dieting is responsible for much\nmischief; it induces a state of chronic exacerbation. Nobody would\nbelieve how nobly I struggle, day and night, against its evil\nsuggestions. A man’s worst enemy is his own empty stomach. None knew it\nbetter than Horace.",
        "And yet he declared that lettuces and such-like stuff sufficed him. No\ndoubt, no doubt. “Olives nourish me.” Just so! One does not grow up in\nthe school of Maecenas without learning the subtle delights of the\nsimple life. But I would wager that after a week of such feeding as I\nhave now undergone at his native place, he would quickly have remembered\nsome urgent business to be transacted in the capital–Caesar Augustus,\nme-thinks, would have desired his company. And even so, I have suddenly\nwoke up to the fact that Taranto, my next resting-place, besides\npossessing an agreeably warm climate, has some passable restaurants. I\nwill pack without delay. Mount Vulture must wait. The wind alone, the\nVulturnus or south-easterly wind, is quite enough to make one despair of\nclimbing hills. It has blown with objectionable persistency ever since\nmy arrival at Venosa.",
        "To escape from its attentions, I have been wandering about the secluded\nvalleys that seam this region. Streamlets meander here amid rustling\ncanes and a luxuriant growth of mares’ tails and creepers; their banks\nare shaded by elms and poplars–Horatian trees; the thickets are loud\nwith songs of nightingale, black-cap and oriole. These humid dells are a\ndifferent country from the uplands, wind-swept and thriftily cultivated.",
        "It was here, yesterday, that I came upon an unexpected sight–an army of\nworkmen engaged in burrowing furiously into the bowels of Mother Earth.\nThey told me that this tunnel would presently become one of the arteries\nof that vast system, the Apulian Aqueduct. The discovery accorded with\nmy Roman mood, for the conception and execution alike of this grandiose\nproject are worthy of the Romans. Three provinces where, in years of\ndrought, wine is cheaper than water, are being irrigated–in the teeth\nof great difficulties of engineering and finance. Among other things,\nthere are 213 kilometres of subterranean tunnellings to be built; eleven\nthousand workmen are employed; the cost is estimated at 125 million\nfrancs. The Italian government is erecting to its glory a monument more\ndurable than brass. This is their heritage from the Romans–this talent\nfor dealing with rocks and waters; for bridling a destructive\nenvironment and making it subservient to purposes of human\nintercourse. It is a part of that practical Roman genius for\n\"pacification.” Wild nature, to the Latin, ever remains an obstacle to\nbe overcome–an enemy.",
        "Such was Horace’s point of view. The fruitful fields and their hardy\nbrood of tillers appealed to him; [Footnote: See next chapter.]\nthe ocean and snowy Alps were beyond the range of his affections. His\nlove of nature was heartfelt, but his nature was not ours; it was nature\nas we see it in those Roman landscapes at Pompeii; nature ancillary to\nhuman needs, in her benignant and comfortable moods. Virgil’s lachrymae\nrerum hints at mystic and extra-human yearnings; to the troubadours\nnature was conventionally stereotyped–a scenic decoration to set off\nsentiments more or less sincere; the roman-ticists wallow in her rugged\naspects. Horace never allowed phantasy to outrun intelligence; he kept\nhis feet on earth; man was the measure of his universe, and a sober mind\nhis highest attribute. Nature must be kept “in her place.” Her\nextrava-gances are not to be admired. This anthropocentric spirit has\nmade him what he is–the ideal anti-sentimentalist and anti-vulgarian.\nFor excess of sentiment, like all other intemperance, is the mark of\nthat unsober and unsteady beast–the crowd.",
        "Things have changed since those days; in proportion as the world has\ngrown narrower and the element of fear and mystery diluted, our\nsympathies have broadened; the Goth, in particular, has learnt the knack\nof detecting natural charm where the Latin, to this day, beholds nothing\nbut confusion and strife.",
        "On the spot, I observe, one is liable to return to the antique outlook;\nto see the beauty of fields and rivers, yet only when subsidiary to\nman’s personal convenience; to appreciate a fair landscape–with a\nshrewd worldly sense of its potential uses. “The garden that I love,\"\nsaid an Italian once to me, “contains good vegetables.” This utilitarian\nflavour of the south has become very intelligible to me during the last\nfew days. I, too, am thinking less of calceolarias than of cauliflowers.",
        "A pilgrimage to the Bandusian Fount (if such it be) is no great\nundertaking–a morning’s trip. The village of San Gervasio is the next\nstation to Venosa, lying on an eminence only thirteen kilometres from\nthere.",
        "Here once ran a fountain which was known as late as the twelfth century\nas the Fons Bandusinus, and Ughelli, in his “Italia Sacra,” cites a deed\nof the year 1103 speaking of a church “at the Bandusian Fount near\nVenosa.” Church and fountain have now disappeared; but the site of the\nformer, they say, is known, and close to it there once issued a copious\nspring called “Fontana Grande.” This is probably the Horatian one; and\nis also, I doubt not, that referred to in Cenna’s chronicle of Venosa:\n\"At Torre San Gervasio are the ruins of a castle and an abundant spring\nof water colder than all the waters of Venosa,” Frigus amabile. . . .",
        "I could discover no one in the place to show me where this now vanished\nchurch stood. I rather think it occupied the site of the present church\nof Saint Anthony, the oldest in San Gervasio.",
        "As to the fountain–there are now two of them, at some considerable\ndistance from each other. Both of them are copious, and both lie near\nthe foot of the hill on which the village now stands. Capmartin de\nChaupy has reasons for believing that in former times San Gervasio did\nnot occupy its present exalted position (vol. iii, p. 538).",
        "One of them gushes out on the plain near the railway station, and has\nbeen rebuilt within recent times. It goes by the name of “Fontana\nrotta.” The other, the “Fontana del Fico,” lies on the high road to\nSpinazzola; the water spouts out of seven mouths, and near at hand is a\nplantation of young sycamores. The basin of this fount was also rebuilt\nabout ten years ago at no little expense, and has now a thoroughly\nmodern and businesslike aspect. But I was told that a complicated\nnetwork of subterranean pipes and passages, leading to “God knows\nwhere,” was unearthed during the process of reconstruction. It was\nmagnificent masonry, said my informant, who was an eye-witness of the\nexcavations but could tell me nothing more of interest.",
        "The problem how far either of these fountains fulfils the conditions\npostulated in the last verse of Horace’s ode may be solved by every one\naccording as he pleases. In fact, there is no other way of solving it.\nIn my professorial mood, I should cite the cavern and the “downward\nleaping” waters against the hypothesis that the Bandusian Fount stood on\neither of these modern sites; in favour of it, one might argue that the\nconventional rhetoric of all Roman art may have added these embellishing\ntouches, and cite, in confirmation thereof, the last two lines of the\nprevious verse, mentioning animals that could hardly have slaked their\nthirst with any convenience at a cavernous spring such as he describes.\nCaverns, moreover, are not always near the summits of hills; they may be\nat the foot of them; and water, even the Thames at London Bridge, always\nleaps downhill–more or less. Of more importance is old Chaupy’s\ndiscovery of the northerly aspect of one of these springs–\"thee the\nfierce season of the blazing dog-star cannot touch.” There may have been\na cave at the back of the “Fontana del Fico\"; the “Fontana rotta” is\nhopelessly uncavernous.",
        "For the rest, there is no reason why the fountain should not have\nchanged its position since ancient days. On the contrary, several things\nmight incline one to think that it has been forced to abandon the high\ngrounds and seek its present lower level. To begin with, the hill on\nwhich the village stands is honeycombed by hives of caves which the\ninhabitants have carved out of the loose conglomerate (which, by the\nway, hardly corresponds with the poet’s saxum); and it may well be\nthat a considerable collapse of these earth-dwellings obstructed the\noriginal source of the waters and obliged them to seek a vent lower down.",
        "Next, there are the notorious effects of deforestation. An old man told\nme that in his early days the hill was covered with timber–indeed, this\nwhole land, now a stretch of rolling grassy downs, was decently wooded\nup to a short time ago. I observed that the roof of the oldest of the\nthree churches, that of Saint Anthony, is formed of wooden rafters (a\nrare material hereabouts). Deforestation would also cause the waters to\nissue at a lower level.",
        "Lastly, and chiefly–the possible shatterings of earthquakes.\nCatastrophes such as those which have damaged Venosa in days past may\nhave played havoc with the water-courses of this place by choking up\ntheir old channels. My acquaintance with the habits of Apulian\nearthquakes, with the science of hydrodynamics and the geological\nformation of San Gervasio is not sufficiently extensive to allow me to\nexpress a mature opinion. I will content myself with presenting to\nfuture investigators the plausible theory–plausible because\nconveniently difficult to refute–that some terrestrial upheaval in past\ndays is responsible for the present state of things.",
        "But these are merely three hypotheses. I proceed to mention three facts\nwhich point in the same direction; i.e. that the water used to issue at\na higher level. Firstly, there is that significant name “Fontana\nrotta\"–\"the broken fountain.” . . . Does not this suggest that its flow\nmay have been interrupted, or intercepted, in former times?",
        "Next, if you climb up from this “Fontana rotta” to the village by the\nfootpath, you will observe, on your right hand as you ascend the slope,\nat about a hundred yards below the Church of Saint Anthony, an old well\nstanding in a field of corn and shaded by three walnuts and an oak. This\nwell is still running, and was described to me as “molto antico.\"\nTherefore an underground stream–in diminished volume, no doubt–still\ndescends from the heights.",
        "Thirdly, in the village you will notice an alley leading out of the\nCorso Manfredi (one rejoices to find the name of Manfred surviving in\nthese lands)–an alley which is entitled “Vico Sirene.” The name arrests\nyour attention, for what have the Sirens to do in these inland regions?\nNothing whatever, unless they existed as ornamental statuary: statuary\nsuch as frequently gives names to streets in Italy, witness the “Street\nof the Faun” in Ouida’s novel, or that of the “Giant” in Naples (which\nhas now been re-christened). It strikes me as a humble but quite\nscholarly speculation to infer that, the chief decorative uses of Sirens\nbeing that of fountain deities, this obscure roadway keeps alive the\ntradition of the old “Fontana Grande\"–ornamented, we may suppose, with\nmarble Sirens–whose site is now forgotten, and whose very name has\nfaded from the memory of the countryfolk.",
        "What, then, does my ramble of two hours at San Gervasio amount to? It\nshows that there is a possibility, at least, of a now vanished fountain\nhaving existed on the heights where it might fulfil more accurately the\nconditions of Horace’s ode. If Ughelli’s church “at the Bandusian Fount\"\nstood on this eminence–well, I shall be glad to corroborate, for once\nin the way, old Ughelli, whose book contains a deal of dire nonsense.\nAnd if the Abbe Chaupy’s suggestion that the village lay at the foot of\nthe hill should ever prove to be wrong–well, his amiable ghost may be\npleased to think that even this does not necessitate the sacrifice of\nhis Venosa theory in favour of that of the scholiast Akron; there is\nstill a way out of the difficulty.",
        "But whether this at San Gervasio is the actual fountain hymned by\nHorace–ah, that is quite another affair! Few poets, to be sure, have\nclung more tenaciously to the memories of their childhood than did he\nand Virgil. And yet, the whole scene may be a figment of his\nimagination–the very word Bandusia may have been coined by him. Who can\ntell? Then there is the Digentia hypothesis. I know it, I know it! I\nhave read some of its defenders, and consider (entre nous) that they\nhave made out a pretty strong case. But I am not in the mood for\ndiscussing their proposition–not just now.",
        "Here at San Gervasio I prefer to think only of the Roman singer, so\nsanely jovial, and of these waters as they flowed, limpid and cool, in\nthe days when they fired his boyish fancy. Deliberately I refuse to hear\nthe charmer Boissier. Deliberately, moreover, I shut my eyes to the\npresent condition of affairs; to the herd of squabbling laundresses and\nthose other incongruities that spoil the antique scene. Why not? The\ntimid alone are scared by microscopic discords of time and place. The\nsage can invest this prosaic water-trough with all its pristine dignity\nand romance by an unfailing expedient. He closes an eye. It is an art he\nlearns early in life; a simple art, and one that greatly conduces to\nhappiness. The ever alert, the conscientiously wakeful–how many fine\nthings they fail to see! Horace knew the wisdom of being genially\nunwise; of closing betimes an eye, or an ear; or both. Desipere in\nloco. . . .",
        "I remember watching an old man stubbornly digging a field by himself. He\ntoiled through the flaming hours, and what he lacked in strength was\nmade up in the craftiness, malizia, born of long love of the soil. The\nground was baked hard; but there was still a chance of rain, and the\npeasants were anxious not to miss it. Knowing this kind of labour, I\nlooked on from my vine-wreathed arbour with admiration, but without envy.",
        "I asked whether he had not children to work for him.",
        "“All dead–and health to you!” he replied, shaking his white head\ndolefully.",
        "And no grandchildren?",
        "“All Americans (emigrants).”",
        "He spoke in dreamy fashion of years long ago when he, too, had\ntravelled, sailing to Africa for corals, to Holland and France; yes, and\nto England also. But our dockyards and cities had faded from his mind;\nhe remembered only our men.",
        "“Che bella gioventu–che bella gioventu!” (\"a sturdy brood”), he kept\non repeating. “And lately,” he added, “America has been discovered.” He\ntoiled fourteen hours a day, and he was 83 years old.",
        "Apart from that creature of fiction, the peasant in fabula whom we all\nknow, I can find little to admire in this whole class of men, whose talk\nand dreams are of the things of the soil, and who knows of nothing save\nthe regular interchange of summer and winter with their unvarying tasks\nand rewards. None save a Cincinnatus or Garibaldi can be ennobled by the\nspade. In spleenful moments, it seems to me that the most depraved of\ncity-dwellers has flashes of enthusiasm and self-abnegation never\nexperienced by this shifty, retrogressive and ungenerous brood, which\nlives like the beasts of the field and has learnt all too much of their\nlogic. But they have a beast-virtue hereabouts which compels\nrespect–contentment in adversity. In this point they resemble the\nRussian peasantry. And yet, who can pity the moujik? His cheeks are\naltogether too round, and his morals too superbly bestial; he has\nclearly been created to sing and starve by turns. But the Italian\npeasant who speaks in the tongue of Homer and Virgil and Boccaccio is\neasily invested with a halo of martyrdom; it is delightful to sympathize\nwith men who combine the manners of Louis Quatorze with the profiles of\nAugustus or Plato, and who still recall, in many of their traits, the\npristine life of Odyssean days. Thus, they wear to-day the identical\n\"clouted leggings of oxhide, against the scratches of the thorns” which\nold Laertes bound about his legs on the upland farm in Ithaka. They call\nthem “galandrine.”",
        "On occasions of drought or flood there is not a word of complaint. I\nhave known these field-faring men and women for thirty years, and have\nyet to hear a single one of them grumble at the weather. It is not\nindifference; it is true philosophy–acquiescence in the inevitable. The\ngrievances of cultivators of lemons and wholesale agriculturalists,\nwhose speculations are often ruined by a single stroke of the human pen\nin the shape of new regulations or tariffs, are a different thing;\ntheir curses are loud and long. But the bean-growers, dependent\nchiefly on wind and weather, only speak of God’s will. They have the\nsame forgiveness for the shortcomings of nature as for a wayward child.\nAnd no wonder they are distrustful. Ages of oppression and misrule have\npassed over their heads; sun and rain, with all their caprice, have been\nkinder friends to them than their earthly masters. Some day, presumably,\nthe government will wake up to the fact that Italy is not an industrial\ncountry, and that its farmers might profitably be taken into account again.",
        "But a change is upon the land. Types like this old man are becoming\nextinct; for the patriarchal system of Coriolanus, the glory of southern\nItaly, is breaking up.",
        "This is not the fault of conscription which, though it destroys old\ndialects, beliefs and customs, widens the horizon by bringing fresh\nideas into the family, and generally sound ones. It does even more; it\nteaches the conscripts to read and write, so that it is no longer as\ndangerous to have dealings with a man who possesses these\naccomplishments as in the days when they were the prerogative of\navvocati and other questionable characters. A countryman, nowadays,\nmay read and write and yet be honest.",
        "What is shattering family life is the speculative spirit born of\nemigration. A continual coming and going; two-thirds of the adolescent\nand adult male population are at this moment in Argentina or the United\nStates–some as far afield as New Zealand. Men who formerly reckoned in\nsous now talk of thousands of francs; parental authority over boys is\nrelaxed, and the girls, ever quick to grasp the advantages of money,\nlose all discipline and steadiness.",
        "“My sons won’t touch a spade,” said a peasant to me; “and when I thrash\nthem, they complain to the police. They simply gamble and drink, waiting\ntheir turn to sail. If I were to tell you the beatings we used to get,\nsir, you wouldn’t believe me. You wouldn’t believe me, not if I took my\noath, you wouldn’t! I can feel them still–speaking with respect–here!”",
        "These emigrants generally stay away three or four years at a stretch,\nand then return, spend their money, and go out again to make more.\nOthers remain for longer periods, coming back with huge incomes–twenty\nto a hundred francs a day. Such examples produce the same effect as\nthose of the few lucky winners in the State lottery; every one talks of\nthem, and forgets the large number of less fortunate speculators.\nMeanwhile the land suffers. The carob-tree is an instance. This\nbeautiful and almost eternal growth, the “hope of the southern\nApennines” as Professor Savastano calls it, whose pods constitute an\nimportant article of commerce and whose thick-clustering leaves yield a\ncool shelter, comparable to that of a rocky cave, in the noonday heat,\nused to cover large tracts of south Italy. Indifferent to the scorching\nrays of the sun, flourishing on the stoniest declivities, and sustaining\nthe soil in a marvellous manner, it was planted wherever nothing else\nwould grow–a distant but sure profit. Nowadays carobs are only cut\ndown. Although their produce rises in value every year, not one is\nplanted; nobody has time to wait for the fruit. [Footnote: There are a\nfew laudable exceptions, such as Prince Belmonte, who has covered large\nstretches of bad land with this tree. (See Consular Reports, Italy, No.\n431.) But he is not a peasant!]",
        "It is nothing short of a social revolution, depopulating the country of\nits most laborious elements. 788,000 emigrants left in one year alone\n(1906); in the province of Basilicata the exodus exceeds the birthrate.\nI do not know the percentage of those who depart never to return, but it\nmust be considerable; the land is full of chronic grass-widows.",
        "Things will doubtless right themselves in due course; it stands to\nreason that in this acute transitional stage the demoralizing effects of\nthe new system should be more apparent than its inevitable benefits.\nAlready these are not unseen; houses are springing up round villages,\nand the emigrants return home with a disrespect for many of their\ncountry’s institutions which, under the circumstances, is neither\ndeplorable nor unjustifiable. A large family of boy-children, once a\ndire calamity, is now the soundest of investments. Soon after their\narrival in America they begin sending home rations of money to their\nparents; the old farm prospers once more, the daughters receive decent\ndowries. I know farmers who receive over three pounds a month from their\nsons in America–all under military age.",
        "“We work, yes,” they will then tell you, “but we also smoke our pipe.”",
        "Previous to this wholesale emigration, things had come to such a pass\nthat the landed proprietor could procure a labourer at a franc a day,\nout of which he had to feed and clothe himself; it was little short of\nslavery. The roles are now reversed, and while landlords are\nimpoverished, the rich emigrant buys up the farms or makes his own terms\nfor work to be done, wages being trebled. A new type of peasant is being\nevolved, independent of family, fatherland or traditions–with a sure\nhaven of refuge across the water when life at home becomes intolerable.",
        "Yes; a change is at hand.",
        "And another of those things which emigration and the new order of\naffairs are surely destroying is that ancient anthropomorphic way of\nlooking at nature, with its expressive turns of speech. A small boy,\nwhom I watched gathering figs last year, informed me that the fig-tree\nwas innamorato delle pietre e cisterne–enamoured of stones and\ncisterns; meaning, that its roots are searchingly destructive to masonry\nand display a fabulous intuition for the proximity of water. He also\ntold me, what was news to me, that there are more than two or three\nvarieties of figs. Will you have his list of them? Here it is:",
        "There is the fico arnese, the smallest of all, and the fico\nsantillo, both of which are best when dried; the fico vollombola,\nwhich is never dried, because it only makes the spring fruit; the fico\nmolegnano, which ripens as late as the end of October and must be eaten\nfresh; the fico coretorto (” wry-heart “–from its shape), which has\nthe most leathery skin of all and is often destroyed by grubs after\nrain; the fico troiano; the fico arzano; and the fico vescovo,\nwhich appears when all the others are over, and is eaten in February\n(this may be the kind referred to in Stamer’s “Dolce Napoli” as deriving\nfrom Sorrento, where the first tree of its kind was discovered growing\nout of the garden wall of the bishop’s palace, whence the name). All\nthese are neri–black.",
        "Now for the white kinds. The fico paradiso has a tender skin, but is\neasily spoilt by rain and requires a ridiculous amount of sun to dry it;\nihe fico vottato is also better fresh; the fico pezzottolo is often\nattacked by grubs, but grows to a large size every two or three years;\nthe fico pascarello is good up till Christmas; the fico natalino;\nlastly, the fico -----, whose name I will not record, though it would\nbe an admirable illustration of that same anthropomorphic turn of mind.\nThe santillo and arnese, he added, are the varieties which are cut\ninto two and laid lengthwise upon each other and so dried (Query: Is not\nthis the “duplex ficus” of Horace?).",
        "“Of course there are other kinds,” he said, “but I don’t remember them\njust now.” When I asked whether he could tell these different fig-trees\napart by the leaves and stems alone and without the fruit, he said that\neach kind, even in winter, retained its peculiar “faccia” (face), but\nthat some varieties are more easy to distinguish than others. I enquired\ninto the mysteries of caprification, and learned that artificial\nripening by means of a drop of oil is practised with some of them,\nchiefly the santillo, vollombola, pascarello and natalino. Then he\ngave me an account of the prices for the different qualities and seasons\nwhich would have astonished a grocer.",
        "All of which proves how easy it is to misjudge of folks who, although\nthey do not know that Paris is the capital of France, yet possess a\ntraining adapted to their present needs. They are specialists for things\nof the grain-giving earth; it is a pleasure to watch them grafting vines\nand olives and lemons with the precision of a trained horticulturist.\nThey talk of “governing” (governare) their soil; it is the word they\nuse in respect to a child.",
        "Now figs are neither white nor black, but such is the terminology.\nStones are white or black; prepared olives are white or black; wine is\nwhite or black. Are they become colour-blind because impregnated,\nfrom earliest infancy, with a perennial blaze of rainbow hues–\ncolour-blinded, in fact; or from negligence, attention to this\nmatter not bringing with it any material advantage? Excepting that\nsign-language which is profoundly interesting from an artistic and\nethnological point of view–why does not some scholar bring old lorio’s\n\"Mimica degli Antichi” up to date?–few things are more worthy of\ninvestigation than the colour-sense of these people. Of blue they have\nnot the faintest conception, probably because there are so few blue\nsolids in nature; Max Mueller holds the idea of blue to be quite\na modern acquisition on the part of the human race. So a cloudless sky\nis declared to be “quite white.” I once asked a lad as to the colour\nof the sea which, at the moment, was of the most brilliant sapphire hue.\nHe pondered awhile and then said:",
        "“Pare come fosse un colore morto” (a sort of dead colour).",
        "Green is a little better known, but still chiefly connected with things\nnot out of doors, as a green handkerchief. The reason may be that this\ntint is too common in nature to be taken note of. Or perhaps because\ntheir chain of association between green and grass is periodically\nbroken up–our fields are always verdant, but theirs turn brown in\nsummer. Trees they sometimes call yellow, as do some ancient writers;\nbut more generally “half-black” or “tree-colour.” A beech in full leaf\nhas been described to me as black. “Rosso” does not mean red, but\nrather dun or dingy; earth is rosso. When our red is to be signified,\nthey will use the word “turco,” which came in with the well-known\ndye-stuff of which the Turks once monopolized the secret. Thus there are\n\"Turkish” apples and “Turkish” potatoes. But “turco” may also mean\nblack–in accordance with the tradition that the Turks, the Saracens,\nwere a black race. Snakes, generally greyish-brown in these parts, are\ndescribed as either white or black; an eagle-owl is half-black; a\nkestrel un quasi bianco. The mixed colours of cloths or silks are\neither beautiful or ugly, and there’s an end of it. It is curious to\ncompare this state of affairs with that existing in the days of Homer,\nwho was, as it were, feeling his way in a new region, and the propriety\nof whose colour epithets is better understood when one sees things on\nthe spot. Of course I am only speaking of the humble peasant whose\nblindness, for the rest, is not incurable.",
        "One might enlarge the argument and deduce his odd insensibility to\ndelicate scents from the fact that he thrives in an atmosphere saturated\nwith violent odours of all kinds; his dullness in regard to finer shades\nof sound–from the shrieks of squalling babies and other domestic\nexplosions in which he lives from the cradle to the grave. That is why\nthese people have no “nerves\"; terrific bursts of din, such as the\npandemonium of Piedigrotta, stimulate them in the same way that others\nmight be stimulated by a quartette of Brahms. And if they who are so\nconcerned about the massacre of small birds in this country would devote\ntheir energies to the invention of a noiseless and yet cheap powder,\ntheir efforts would at last have some prospects of success. For it is\nnot so much the joy of killing, as the pleasurable noise of the gun,\nwhich creates these local sportsmen; as the sagacious “Ultramontain\"\nobserved long ago. “Le napolitain est pas-sionne pour la chasse,” he\nsays, “parce que les coups de fusil flattent son oreille.” [Footnote:\nI have looked him up in Jos. Blanc’s “Bibliographic.” His name was C.\nHaller.] This ingenuous love of noise may be connected, in some way,\nwith their rapid nervous discharges.",
        "I doubt whether intermediate convulsions have left much purity of Greek\nblood in south Italy, although emotional travellers, fresh from the\nnorth, are for ever discovering “classic Hellenic profiles” among the\npeople. There is certainly a scarce type which, for want of a better\nhypothesis, might be called Greek: of delicate build and below the\naverage height, small-eared and straight-nosed, with curly hair that\nvaries from blonde to what Italians call castagno chiaro. It differs\nnot only from the robuster and yet fairer northern breed, but also from\nthe darker surrounding races. But so many contradictory theories have\nlately been promulgated on this head, that I prefer to stop short at the\npreliminary question–did a Hellenic type ever exist? No more, probably,\nthan that charming race which the artists of Japan have invented for our\ndelectation.",
        "Strains of Greek blood can be traced with certainty by their track of\nfolklore and poetry and song, such as still echoes among the vales of\nSparta and along the Bosphorus. Greek words are rather rare here, and\nthose that one hears–such as sciusciello, caruso, crisommele,\netc.–have long ago been garnered by scholars like De Grandis, Moltedo,\nand Salvatore Mele. So Naples is far more Hellenic in dialect, lore,\nsong and gesture than these regions, which are still rich in pure\nlatinisms of speech, such as surgere (to arise); scitare (excitare–to\narouse); e (est–yes); fetare (foetare); trasete (transitus–passage of\nquails); titillare (to tickle); craje (cras–to-morrow); pastena (a\nplantation of young vines; Ulpian has “pastinum instituere”). A woman is\ncalled “muliera,” a girl “figliola,” and children speak of their fathers\nas “tata” (see Martial, epig. I, 101). Only yesterday I added a\nbeautiful latinism to my collection, when an old woman, in whose cottage\nI sometimes repose, remarked to me, “Non avete virtu oggi “–you are not\nup to the mark to-day. The real, antique virtue! I ought to have\nembraced her. No wonder I have no “virtue” just now. This savage\nVulturnian wind–did it not sap the Roman virtue at Cannae?",

        "The same as a sopranome. It is a nickname which, as with the Russian\npeasants, takes the place of Christian and surname together. A man will\ntell you: “My name is Luigi, but they call me, by contranome,\nO’Canzirro. I don’t know my surname.” Some of these nicknames are\nintelligible, such as O’Sborramurella, which refers to the man’s\nprofession of building those walls without mortar which are always\ntumbling down and being repaired again; or O’Sciacquariello (acqua–a\nleaking–one whose money leaks from his pocket–a spendthrift); or San\nPietro, from his saintly appearance; O’Civile, who is so uncivilized, or\nCristoforo Colombo, because he is so very wideawake. But eighty per cent\nof them are quite obscure even to their owners, going back, as they do,\nto some forgotten trick or incident during childhood or to some pet name\nwhich even in the beginning meant nothing. Nearly every man and boy has\nhis contranome by which, and by which alone, he is known in his\nvillage; the women seldomer, unless they are conspicuous by some\npeculiarity, such as A’Sbirra (the spy), or A’Paponnessa (the fat\none)–whose counterpart, in the male sex, would be O’Tripone.",
        "Conceive, now, what trouble it entails to find a man in a strange\nvillage if you happen not to know his contranome (and how on earth are\nyou to discover it?), if his surname means nothing to the inhabitants,\nand his Christian name is shared by a hundred others. For they have an\namazing lack of inventiveness in this matter; four or five Christian\nnames will include the whole population of the place. Ten to one you\nwill lose a day looking for him, unless something like this takes place:",
        "You set forth your business to a crowd of villagers that have collected\naround. It is simple enough. You want to speak to Luigi So-and-so. A\ngood-natured individual, who seems particularly anxious to help,\nsummarizes affairs by saying:",
        "“The gentleman wants Luigi So-and-so.”",
        "There is evidently some joke in the mere suggestion of such a thing;\nthey all smile. Then a confused murmur of voices goes up:",
        "“Luigi–Luigi. . . . Now which Luigi does he mean?”",
        "You repeat his surname in a loud voice. It produces no effect, beyond\nthat of increased hilarity.",
        "“Luigi–Luigi. . . .”",
        "“Perhaps O’Zoccolone?”",
        "“Perhaps O’Seticchio?”",
        "“Or the figlio d’ O’Zibalocchio?”",
        "The good-natured individual volunteers to beat the surrounding district\nand bring in all the Luigis he can find. After half an hour they begin\nto arrive, one by one. He is not among them. Dismissed with cigars, as\ncompensation for loss of time.",
        "Meanwhile half the village has gathered around, vastly enjoying the fun,\nwhich it hopes will last till bedtime. You are getting bewildered; new\npeople flock in from the fields to whom the mysterious joke about Luigi\nmust be explained.",
        "“Luigi–Luigi,” they begin again. “Now, which of them can he mean?”",
        "“Perhaps O’Marzariello?”",
        "“Or O’Cuccolillo?”",
        "“I never thought of him,” says the good-natured individual. “Here, boy,\nrun and tell O’Cuccolillo that a foreign gentleman wants to give him a\ncigar.”",
        "By the time O’Cuccolillo appears on the scene the crowd has thickened.\nYou explain the business for the fiftieth time; no–he is Luigi, of\ncourse, but not the right Luigi, which he regrets considerably. Then the\njoke is made clear to him, and he laughs again. You have lost all your\nnerve, but the villagers are beginning to love you,",
        "“Can it be O’Sciabecchino?”",
        "“Or the figlio d’ O’Chiappino?”",
        "“It might be O’Busciardiello (the liar).”",
        "“He’s dead.”",
        "“So he is. I quite forgot. Well, then it must be the husband of\nA’Cicivetta (the flirt).”",
        "“He’s in prison. But how about O’Caccianfierno?”",
        "Suddenly a withered hag croaks authoritatively:",
        "“I know! The gentleman wants O’Tentillo.”",
        "Chorus of villagers:",
        "“Then why doesn’t he say so?”",
        "O’Tentillo lives far, far away. An hour elapses; at last he comes, full\nof bright expectations. No, this is not your Luigi, he is another Luigi.\nYou are ready to sink into the earth, but there is no escape. The crowd\nsurges all around, the news having evidently spread to neighbouring\nhamlets.",
        "“Luigi–Luigi. . . . Let me see. It might be O’Rappo.”",
        "“O’Massassillo, more likely.”",
        "“I have it! It’s O’Spennatiello.”",
        "“I never thought of him,” says a well-known voice. “Here, boy, run and\ntell-----”",
        "“Or O’Cicereniello.”",
        "“O’Vergeniello.”",
        "“O’Sciabolone. ...”",
        "“Never mind the G----- d----- son of b-----,” says a cheery person in\nexcellent English, who has just arrived on the scene. “See here, I live\nfifteen years in Brooklyn; damn fine! ’Ave a glass of wine round my\nplace. Your Luigi’s in America, sure. And if he isn’t, send him to Hell.”",
        "Sound advice, this.",
        "“What’s his surname, anyhow?” he goes on.",
        "You explain once more.",
        "“Why, there’s the very man you’re looking for. There, standing right in\nfront of you! He’s Luigi, and that’s his surname right enough. He don’t\nknow it himself, you bet.”",
        "And he points to the good-natured individual. . . .",
        "These countryfolk can fare on strange meats. A boy consumed a snake that\nwas lying dead by the roadside; a woman ate thirty raw eggs and then a\nplate of maccheroni; a man swallowed six kilograms of the uncooked fat\nof a freshly slaughtered pig (he was ill for a week afterwards); another\none devoured two small birds alive, with beaks, claws and feathers. Such\ndeeds are sternly reprobated as savagery; still, they occur, and nearly\nalways as the result of wagers. I wish I could couple them with equally\nheroic achievements in the drinking line, but, alas! I have only heard\nof one old man who was wont habitually to en-gulph twenty-two litres of\nwine a day; eight are spoken of as “almost too much” in these degenerate\ndays. . . .",
        "Mice, says Movers, were sacrificially eaten by the Babylonians. Here, as\nin England, they are cooked into a paste and given to children, to cure\na certain complaint. To take away the dread of the sea from young boys,\nthey mix into their food small fishes which have been devoured by larger\nones and taken from their stomachs–the underlying idea being that these\nhalf-digested fry are thoroughly familiar with the storms and perils of\nthe deep, and will communicate these virtues to the boys who eat them.\nIt is the same principle as that of giving chamois blood to the\ngoat-boys of the Alps, to strengthen their nerves against\ngiddiness–pure sympathetic magic, of which there is this, at least, to\nbe said, that “its fundamental conception is identical with that of\nmodern science–a faith in the order or uniformity of nature.”",
        "I have also met persons who claim to have been cured of rachitic\ntroubles in their youth by eating a puppy dog cooked in a saucepan. But\nonly one kind of dog is good for this purpose, to be procured from those\nfoundling hospitals whither hundreds of illegitimate infants are taken\nas soon as possible after birth. The mothers, to relieve the discomfort\ncaused by this forcible separation from the new-born, buy a certain kind\nof puppy there, bring them home, and nourish them in loco infantis.\nThese puppies cost a franc apiece, and are generally destroyed after\nperforming their duties; it is they who are cooked for curing the\nscrofulous tendencies of other children. Swallows’ hearts are also used\nfor another purpose; so is the blood of tortoises–for strengthening the\nbacks of children (the tortoise being a hard animal). So is that of\nsnakes, who are held up by head and tail and pricked with needles; the\ngreater their pain, the more beneficial their blood, which is soaked up\nwith cotton-wool and applied as a liniment for swollen glands. In fact,\nnearly every animal has been discovered to possess some medicinal property.",
        "But of the charm of such creatures the people know nothing. How\ndifferent from the days of old! These legendary and gracious beasts,\nthat inspired poets and artists and glyptic engravers–these things of\nbeauty have now descended into the realm of mere usefulness, into the\npharmacopoeia.",
        "The debasement is quite intelligible, when one remembers what\naccumulated miseries these provinces have undergone. Memories of\nrefinement were starved out of the inhabitants by centuries of misrule,\nwhen nothing was of interest or of value save what helped to fill the\nbelly. The work of bestialization was carried on by the despotism of\nSpanish Viceroys and Bourbons. They, the Spaniards, fostered and perhaps\nimported the Camorra, that monster of many heads which has established\nitself in nearly every town of the south. Of the deterioration in taste\ncoincident with this period, I lately came across this little bit of\nevidence, curious and conclusive:–In 1558 a number of the country-folk\nwere captured in one of the usual Corsair raids; they were afterwards\nransomed, and among the Christian names of the women I note: Livia,\nFiula, Cassandra, Aurelia, Lucrezia, Verginia, Medea, Violanta, Galizia,\nVittoria, Diamanta, etc. Where were these full-sounding noble names two\ncenturies later–where are they nowadays? Do they not testify to a state\nof culture superior to that of the present time, when Maria, Lucia, and\nabout four others of the most obvious catholic saints exhaust the list\nof all female Christian names hereabouts?",
        "All this is changing once more; a higher standard of comfort is being\nevolved, though relics of this former state of insecurity may still be\nfound; such as the absence, even in houses of good families, of clocks\nand watches, and convenient storage for clothes and domestic utensils;\ntheir habits of living in penury and of buying their daily food by\nfarthings, as though one never knew what the next day might bring; their\ndread of going out of doors by night (they have a proverb which runs,\ndi notte, non parlar forte; di giorno, guardati attorno), their lack\nof humour. For humour is essentially a product of ease, and nobody can\nbe at ease in unquiet times. That is why so few poets are humorous;\ntheir restlessly querulous nature has the same effect on their outlook\nas an insecure environment.",
        "But it will be long ere these superstitions are eradicated. The magic of\nsouth Italy deserves to be well studied, for the country is a cauldron\nof demonology wherein Oriental beliefs–imported direct from Egypt, the\nclassic home of witchcraft–commingled with those of the West. A\nforeigner is at an unfortunate disadvantage; if he asks questions, he\nwill only get answers dictated by suspicion or a deliberate desire to\nmislead–prudent answers; whoso accepts these explanations in good\nfaith, might produce a wondrous contribution to ethnology.",
        "Wise women and wizards abound, but they are not to be compared with that\nsanta near Naples whom I used to visit in the nineties, and who was so\nsuccessful in the magics that the Bishop of Pozzuoli, among hundreds of\nother clients, was wont to drive up to her door once a week for a\nconsultation. These mostly occupy themselves with the manufacture of\ncharms for gaining lucky lottery numbers, and for deluding fond women\nwho wish to change their lovers.",
        "The lore of herbs is not much studied. For bruises, a slice of the\nOpuntia is applied, or the cooling parietaria (known as “pareta” or\n\"paretene”); the camomile and other common remedies are in vogue; the\nvirtues of the male fern, the rue, sabina and (home-made) ergot of rye\nare well known but not employed to the extent they are in Russia, where\na large progeny is a disaster. There is a certain respect for the\nlegitimate unborn, and even in cases of illegitimacy some neighbouring\nfoundling hospital, the house of the Madonna, is much more convenient.",
        "It is a true monk’s expedient; it avoids the risk of criminal\nprosecution; the only difference being that the Mother of God, and not\nthe natural mother of the infant, becomes responsible for its prompt and\nalmost inevitable destruction. [Footnote: The scandals that\noccasionally arise in connection with that saintly institution, the\nFoundling Hospital at Naples, are enough to make humanity shudder. Of\n856 children living under its motherly care during 1895, 853 “died” in\nthe course of that one year-only three survived; a wholesale massacre.\nThese 853 murdered children were carried forward in the books as still\nliving, and the institution, which has a yearly revenue of over 600,000\nfrancs, was debited with their maintenance, while 42 doctors (instead of\nthe prescribed number of 19) continued to draw salaries for their\nservices to these innocents that had meanwhile been starved and tortured\nto death. The official report on these horrors ends with the words:\n\"There is no reason to think that these facts are peculiar to the year\n1895.\"]",
        "That the moon stands in sympathetic relations with living vegetation is\na fixed article of faith among the peasantry. They will prune their\nplants only when the satellite is waxing–al sottile detta luna, as\nthey say. Altogether, the moon plays a considerable part in their lore,\nas might be expected in a country where she used to be worshipped under\nso many forms. The dusky markings on her surface are explained by saying\nthat the moon used to be a woman and a baker of bread, her face gleaming\nwith the reflection of the oven, but one day she annoyed her mother, who\ntook up the brush they use for sweeping away the ashes, and smirched her\nface. . . .",
        "Whoever reviews the religious observances of these people as a whole\nwill find them a jumble of contradictions and incongruities, lightly\nheld and as lightly dismissed. Theirs is the attitude of mind of little\nchildren–of those, I mean, who have been so saturated with Bible\nstories and fairy tales that they cease to care whether a thing be true\nor false, if it only amuses for the moment. That is what makes them an\nideal prey for the quack physician. They will believe anything so long\nas it is strange and complicated; a straightforward doctor is not\nlistened to; they want that mystery-making “priest-physician\"\nconcerning whom a French writer–I forget his name–has wisely\ndiscoursed. I once recommended a young woman who was bleeding at the\nnose to try the homely remedy of a cold key. I thought she would have\ndied of laughing! The expedient was too absurdly simple to be efficacious.",
        "The attitude of the clergy in regard to popular superstitions is the\nsame here as elsewhere. They are too wise to believe them, and too\nshrewd to discourage the belief in others; these things can be turned to\naccount for keeping the people at a conveniently low level of\nintelligence. For the rest, these priests are mostly good fellows of the\nlive-and-let-live type, who would rather cultivate their own potatoes\nthan quarrel about vestments or the Trinity. Violently acquisitive, of\ncourse, like most southerners. I know a parish priest, a son of poor\nparents, who, by dint of sheer energy, has amassed a fortune of half a\nmillion francs. He cannot endure idleness in any shape, and a fine\nmediaeval scene may be witnessed when he suddenly appears round the\ncorner and catches his workmen wasting their time and his money–",
        "“Ha, loafers, rogues, villains, vermin and sons of bastardi cornuti!\nIf God had not given me these garments and thereby closed my lips to all\nevil-speaking (seizing his cassock and displaying half a yard of purple\nstocking)–wouldn’t I just tell you, spawn of adulterous assassins, what\nI think of you!”",
        "But under the new regime these priests are becoming mere decorative\nsurvivals, that look well enough in the landscape, but are not taken\nseriously save in their match-making and money-lending capacities.",
        "The intense realism of their religion is what still keeps it alive for\nthe poor in spirit. Their saints and devils are on the same familiar\nfooting towards mankind as were the old gods of Greece. Children do not\nknow the meaning of “Inferno\"; they call it “casa del diavolo” (the\ndevil’s house); and if they are naughty, the mother says, “La Madonna\nstrilla\"–the Madonna will scold. Here is a legend of Saint Peter,\ninteresting for its realism and because it has been grafted upon a very\nancient motif:–",
        "The apostle Peter was a dissatisfied sort of man, who was always\ngrumbling about things in general and suggesting improvements in the\nworld-scheme. He thought himself cleverer even than “N. S. G. C.” One\nday they were walking together in an olive orchard, and Peter said:",
        "“Just look at the trouble and time it takes to collect all those\nmiserable little olives. Let’s have them the size of melons.”",
        "“Very well. Have your way, friend Peter! But something awkward is bound\nto happen. It always does, you know, with those improvements of yours.\"\nAnd, sure enough, one of these enormous olives fell from the tree\nstraight on the saint’s head, and ruined his new hat.",
        "“I told you so,” said N. S. G. C.",
        "I remember a woman explaining to me that the saints in Heaven took their\nfood exactly as we do, and at the same hours.",
        "“The same food?” I asked. “Does the Madonna really eat beans?”",
        "“Beans? Not likely! But fried fish, and beefsteaks of veal.” I tried to\npicture the scene, but the effort was too much for my hereditary Puritan\nleanings. Unable to rise to these heights of realism, I was rated a\npagan for my ill-timed spirituality.",
        "Madame est servie. . . .",
        "The train conveying me to Taranto was to halt for the night at the\nsecond station beyond Venosa–at Spinaz-zola. Aware of this fact, I had\nenquired about the place and received assuring reports as to its hotel\naccommodation. But the fates were against me. On my arrival in the late\nevening I learnt that the hotels were all closed long ago, the townsfolk\nhaving gone to bed “with the chickens\"; it was suggested that I had\nbetter stay at the station, where the manageress of the restaurant kept\ncertain sleeping quarters specially provided for travellers in my\npredicament.",
        "Presently the gentle dame lighted a dim lantern and led me across what\nseemed to be a marsh (it was raining) to the door of a hut which was to\nbe my resting-place. At the entrance she paused, and after informing me\nthat a band of musicians had taken all the beds save one which was at my\ndisposal if I were good enough to pay her half a franc, she placed the\nlantern in my hand and stumbled back into the darkness.",
        "I stepped into a low chamber, the beds of which were smothered under a\nprofusion of miscellaneous wraps. The air was warm–the place exhaled an\nindescribable esprit de corps. Groping further, I reached another\napartment, vaulted and still lower than the last, an old-fashioned\ncow-stable, possibly, converted into a bedroom. One glance sufficed me:\nthe couch was plainly not to be trusted. Thankful to be out of the rain\nat least, I lit a pipe and prepared to pass the weary hours till 4 a.m.",
        "It was not long ere I discovered that there was another bed in this den,\nopposite my own; and judging by certain undulatory and saltatory\nmovements within, it was occupied. Presently the head of a youth\nemerged, with closed eyes and flushed features. He indulged in a series\nof groans and spasmodic kicks, that subsided once more, only to\nrecommence. A flute projected from under his pillow.",
        "“This poor young man,” I thought, “is plainly in bad case. On account of\nillness, he has been left behind by the rest of the band, who have gone\nto Spinazzola to play at some marriage festival. He is feverish, or\npossibly subject to fits–to choriasis or who knows what disorder of the\nnervous system. A cruel trick, to leave a suffering youngster alone in\nthis foul hovel.” I mis-liked his symptoms–that anguished complexion\nand delirious intermittent trembling, and began to run over the scanty\nstock of household remedies contained in my bag, wondering which of them\nmight apply to his complaint. There was court plaster and boot polish,\nquinine, corrosive sublimate and Worcester sauce (detestable stuff, but\nindispensable hereabouts).",
        "Just as I had decided in favour of the last-named, he gave a more than\nusually vigorous jerk, sat up in bed and, opening his eyes, remarked:",
        "“Those fleas!”",
        "This, then, was the malady. I enquired why he had not joined his\ncompanions.",
        "He was tired, he said; tired of life in general, and of flute-playing in\nparticular. Tired, moreover, of certain animals; and with a tiger-like\nspring he leapt out of bed.",
        "Once thoroughly awake, he proved an amiable talker, though oppressed\nwith an incurable melancholy which no amount of tobacco and Venosa wine\ncould dispel. In gravely boyish fashion he told me of his life and\nambitions. He had passed a high standard at school, but–what would\nyou?–every post was crowded. He liked music, and would gladly take it\nup as a profession, if anything could be learnt with a band such as his;\nhe was sick, utterly sick, of everything. Above all things, he wished to\ntravel. Visions of America floated before his mind–where was the money\nto come from? Besides, there was the military service looming close at\nhand; and then, a widowed mother at home–the inevitable mother–with a\ncouple of little sisters; how shall a man desert his family? He was born\non a farm on the Murge, the watershed between this country and the\nAdriatic. Thinking of the Murge, that shapeless and dismal range of\nlimestone hills whose name suggests its sad monotony, I began to\nunderstand the origin of his pagan wistfulness.",
        "“Happy foreigners!\"–such was his constant refrain–\"happy foreigners,\nwho can always do exactly what they like! Tell me something about other\ncountries,” he said.",
        "“Something true?”",
        "“Anything–anything!”",
        "To cheer him up, I replied with improbable tales of Indian life, of\nrajahs and diamonds, of panthers whose eyes shine like moonbeams in the\ndark jungle, of elephants huge as battleships, of sportive monkeys who\ntie knots in each others’ tails and build themselves huts among the\ntrees, where they brew iced lemonade, which they offer in friendliest\nfashion to the thirsty wayfarer, together with other light\nrefreshment-----",
        "“Cigarettes as well?”",
        "“No. They are not allowed to cultivate tobacco.”",
        "“Ah, that monopolio, the curse of humanity!”",
        "He was almost smiling when, at 2.30 a.m., there resounded a furious\nknocking at the door, and the rest of the band appeared from their\nunknown quarters in the liveliest of spirits. Altogether, a memorable\nnight. But at four o’clock the lantern was extinguished and the cavern,\nbereft of its Salvator-Rosa glamour, resolved itself into a prosaic and\ninfernally unclean hovel. Issuing from the door, I saw those murky\nrecesses invaded by the uncompromising light of dawn, and shuddered. . . .",
        "The railway journey soon dispelled the phantoms of the night. As the\ntrain sped downhill, the sun rose in splendour behind the Murge hills,\ndevouring mists so thickly couched that, struck by the first beams, they\nglistered like compact snow-fields, while their shaded portions might\nhave been mistaken for stretches of mysterious swamp, from which an\noccasional clump of tree-tops emerged, black and island-like. These\ndreamland effects lasted but a brief time, and soon the whole face of\nthe landscape was revealed. An arid region, not unlike certain parts of\nnorthern Africa.",
        "Yet the line passes through places renowned in history. Who would not\nlike to spend a day at Altamura, if only in memory of its treatment by\nthe ferocious Cardinal Ruffo and his army of cut-throats? After a heroic\nbut vain resistance comparable only to that of Saguntum or Petelia,\nduring which every available metal, and even money, was converted into\nbullets to repel the assailers, there followed a three days’ slaughter\nof young and old; then the cardinal blessed his army and pronounced, in\nthe blood-drenched streets, a general absolution. Even this man has\ndiscovered apologists. No cause so vile, that some human being will not\nbe found to defend it.",
        "So much I called to mind that morning from the pages of Colletta, and\nstraightway formed a resolution to slip out of the carriage and arrest\nmy journey at Altamura for a couple of days. But I must have been asleep\nwhile the train passed through the station, nor did I wake up again till\nthe blue Ionian was in sight.",
        "At Venosa one thinks of Roman legionaries fleeing from Hannibal,\nof Horace, of Norman ambitions; Lucera and Manfredonia call up\nSaracen memories and the ephemeral gleams of Hohen-staufen; Gargano\ntakes us back into Byzantine mysticism and monkery. And now from\nAltamura with its dark record of Bourbon horrors, we glide into the\nsunshine of Hellenic days when the wise Archytas, sage and lawgiver,\nfriend of Plato, ruled this ancient city of Tarentum. A wide sweep of\nhistory! And if those Periclean times be not remote enough, yonder lies\nOria on its hilltop, the stronghold of pre-Hellenic and almost legendary\nMessapians; while for such as desire more recent associations there is\nthe Albanian colony of San Giorgio, only a few miles distant, to recall\nthe glories of Scanderbeg and his adventurous bands.",
        "Herein lies the charm of travel in this land of multiple\ncivilizations–the ever-changing layers of culture one encounters, their\nwondrous juxtaposition.",
        "My previous experiences of Taranto hotels counselled me to take a\nprivate room overlooking the inland sea (the southern aspect is already\nintolerably hot), and to seek my meals at restaurants. And in such a one\nI have lived for the last ten days or so, reviving old memories. The\nplace has grown in the interval; indeed, if one may believe certain\npersons, the population has increased from thirty to ninety thousand\nin–I forget how few years. The arsenal brings movement into the town;\nit has appropriated the lion’s share of building sites in the “new\"\ntown. Is it a ripple on the surface of things, or will it truly stir the\nspirits of the city? So many arsenals have come and gone, at Taranto!",
        "This arsenal quarter is a fine example of the Italian mania of fare\nfigura–everything for effect. It is an agglomeration of dreary\nstreets, haunted by legions of clamorous black swifts, and constructed\non the rectangular principle dear to the Latin mind. Modern, and\nsurpassingly monotonous. Are such interminable rows of stuccoed barracks\nartistic to look upon, are they really pleasant to inhabit? Is it\nreasonable or even sanitary, in a climate of eight months’ sunshine, to\nbuild these enormous roadways and squares filled with glaring limestone\ndust that blows into one’s eyes and almost suffocates one; these Saharas\nthat even at the present season of the year (early June) cannot be\ntraversed comfortably unless one wears brown spectacles and goes veiled\nlike a Tuareg? This arsenal quarter must be a hell during the really not\nseason, which continues into October.",
        "For no trees whatever are planted to shade the walking population, as in\nParis or Cairo or any other sunlit city.",
        "And who could guess the reason? An Englishman, at least, would never\nbring himself to believe what is nevertheless a fact, namely, that if\nthe streets are converted into shady boulevards, the rents of the houses\nimmediately fall. When trees are planted, the lodgers complain and\nfinally emigrate to other quarters; the experiment has been tried, at\nNaples and elsewhere, and always with the same result. Up trees, down\nrents. The tenants refuse to be deprived of their chief pleasure in\nlife–that of gazing at the street-passengers, who must be good enough\nto walk in the sunshine for their delectation. But if you are of an\ninquisitive turn of mind, you are quite at liberty to return the\ncompliment and to study from the outside the most intimate details of\nthe tenants’ lives within. Take your fill of their domestic doings;\nstare your hardest. They don’t mind in the least, not they! That feeling\nof privacy which the northerner fosters doggedly even in the centre of a\nteeming city is alien to their hearts; they like to look and be looked\nat; they live like fish in an aquarium. It is a result of the whole\npalazzo-System that every one knows his neighbour’s business better than\nhis own. What does it matter, in the end? Are we not all “Christians “?",
        "The municipality, meanwhile, is deeply indebted for the sky-piercing\nambitions which have culminated in the building of this new quarter. To\nmeet these obligations, the octroi prices have been raised to the\nhighest pitch by the City Fathers. This octroi is farmed out and\nproduces (they tell me) 120 pounds a day; there are some hundred\ntoll-collecting posts at the outskirts of the town, and the average\nsalary of their officials is three pounds a month. They are supposed to\nbe respectable and honest men, but it is difficult to see how a family\ncan be supported on that wage, when one knows how high the rents are,\nand how severely the most ordinary commodities of life are taxed.",
        "I endeavoured to obtain photographs of the land as it looked ere it was\ncovered by the arsenal quarter, but in vain. Nobody seems to have\nthought it worth while preserving what would surely be a notable\neconomic document for future generations. Out of sheer curiosity I also\ntried to procure a plan of the old quarter, that labyrinth of\nthick-clustering humanity, where the Streets are often so narrow that\ntwo persons can barely squeeze past each other. I was informed that no\nsuch plan had ever been drawn up; it was agreed that a map of this kind\nmight be interesting, and suggested, furthermore, that I might undertake\nthe task myself; the authorities would doubtless appreciate my labours.\nWe foreigners, be it understood, have ample means and unlimited leisure,\nand like nothing better than doing unprofitable jobs of this kind.\n[Footnote: here is a map of old Taranto in Lasor a Varea (Savonarola)\nUniversus terrarum etc., Vol. II, p. 552, and another in J. Blaev’s\nTheatrum Civitatum (1663). He talks of the “rude houses” of this\ntown.]",
        "One is glad to leave the scintillating desert of this arsenal quarter,\nand enter the cool stone-paved streets of the other, which remind one\nsomewhat of Malta. In the days of Salis-Marschlins this city possessed\nonly 18,000 inhabitants, and “outdid even the customary Italian filth,\nbeing hardly passable on account of the excessive nastiness and stink.\"\nIt is now scrupulously clean–so absurdly clean, that it has quite\nceased to be picturesque. Not that its buildings are particularly\nattractive to me; none, that is, save the antique “Trinita” column of\nDoric gravity–sole survivor of Hellenic Taras, which looks wondrously\nout of place in its modern environment. One of the finest of these\nearlier monuments, the Orsini tower depicted in old prints of the place,\nhas now been demolished.",
        "Lovers of the baroque may visit the shrine of Saint Cataldo, a jovial\nnightmare in stone. And they who desire a literary pendant to this\nfantastic structure should read the life of the saint written by Morone\nin 1642. Like the shrine, it is the quintessence of insipid exuberance;\nthere is something preposterous in its very title “Cataldiados,” and\nwhoever reads through those six books of Latin hexameters will arise\nfrom the perusal half-dazed. Somehow or other, it dislocates one’s whole\nsense of terrestrial values to see a frowsy old monk [Footnote: This\nwandering Irish missionary is supposed to have died here in the seventh\ncentury, and they who are not satisfied with his printed biographies\nwill find one in manuscript of 550 pages, compiled in 1766, in the Cuomo\nLibrary at Naples.] treated in the heroic style and metre, as though he\nwere a new Achilles. As a jeu d’esprit the book might pass; but it is\ndeadly serious. Single men will always be found to perpetrate\nmonstrosities of literature; the marvel is that an entire generation of\nwriters should have worked themselves into a state of mind which\nsolemnly approved of such freaks.",
        "Every one has heard of the strange position of this hoary island-citadel\n(a metropolis, already, in neolithic days). It is of oval shape, the\nbroad sides washed by the Ionian Sea and an oyster-producing lagoon;\nbridges connect it at one extremi-y with the arsenal or new town, and at\nthe other with the so-called commercial quarter. It is as if some\nprecious gem were set, in a ring, between two others of minor worth. Or,\nto vary the simile, this acropolis, with its close-packed alleys, is the\nthrobbing heart of Taranto; the arsenal quarter–its head; and that\nother one–well, its stomach; quite an insignificant stomach as compared\nwith the head and corroborative, in so far, of the views of\nMetch-nikoff, who holds that this hitherto commendable organ ought now\nto be reduced in size, if not abolished altogether. . . .",
        "From out of this window I gaze upon the purple lagoon flecked with\nwarships and sailing-boats; and beyond it, upon the venerable land of\nJapygia, the heel of Italy, that rises in heliotrope-tinted undulations\ntowards the Adriatic watershed. At night-time an exquisite perfume of\nflowers and ripe corn comes wafted into my room over the still waters,\nand when the sun rises, white settlements begin to sparkle among its\nolives and vineyards. My eyes often rest upon one of them; it is\nGrottaglie, distant a few miles from Taranto on the Brindisi line. I\nmust visit Grottaglie, for it was here that the flying monk received his\neducation.",
        "The flying monk!",
        "The theme is not inappropriate at this moment, when the newspapers are\nringing with the Paris-Rome aviation contest and the achievements of\nBeaumont, Garros and their colleagues. I have purposely brought his\nbiography with me, to re-peruse on the spot. But let me first explain\nhow I became acquainted with this seventeenth-century pioneer of aviation.",
        "It was an odd coincidence.",
        "I had arrived in Naples, and was anxious to have news of the proceedings\nat a certain aviation meeting in the north, where a rather inexperienced\nfriend of mine had insisted upon taking a part; the newspaper reports of\nthese entertainments are enough to disturb anybody. While admiring the\ngreat achievements of modern science in this direction, I wished\ndevoutly, at that particular moment, that flying had never been\ninvented; and it was something of a coincidence, I say, that stumbling\nin this frame of mind down one of the unspeakable little side-streets in\nthe neighbourhood of the University, my glance should have fallen upon\nan eighteenth-century engraving in a bookseller’s window which depicted\na man raised above the ground without any visible means of\nsupport–flying, in short. He was a monk, floating before an altar. A\ncompanion, near at hand, was portrayed as gazing in rapturous wonder at\nthis feat of levitation. I stepped within and demanded the volume to\nwhich this was the frontispiece.",
        "The salesman, a hungry-looking old fellow with incredibly dirty hands\nand face, began to explain.",
        "“The Flying Monk, sir, Joseph of Copertino. A mighty saint and conjuror!\nOr perhaps you would like some other book? I have many, many lives of\nsanti here. Look at this one of the great Egidio, for instance. I can\ntell you all about him, for he raised my mother’s grand-uncle from the\ndead; yes, out of the grave, as one may say. You’ll find out all about\nit in this book; and it’s only one of his thousand miracles. And here is\nthe biography of the renowned Giangiuseppe, a mighty saint and-----”",
        "I was paying little heed; the flying monk had enthralled me. An\nunsuspected pioneer of aviation . . . here was a discovery!",
        "“He flew?” I queried, my mind reverting to the much-vaunted triumphs of\nmodern science.",
        "“Why not? The only reason why people don’t fly like that nowadays is\nbecause–well, sir, because they can’t. They fly with machines, and\nthink it something quite new and wonderful. And yet it’s as old as the\nhills! There was Iscariot, for example–Icarus, I mean-----”",
        "“Pure legend, my good man.”",
        "“Everything becomes legend, if the gentleman will have the goodness to\nwait. And here is the biography of-----”",
        "“How much for Joseph of Copertino?” Cost what it may, I said to myself,\nthat volume must be mine.",
        "He took it up and began to turn over the pages lovingly, as though\nhandling some priceless Book of Hours.",
        "“A fine engraving,” he observed, sotto voce. “And this is the best of\nmany biographies of the flying monk. It is by Rossi, the\nMinister-General of the Franciscan order to which our monk belonged; the\nofficial biography, it might be called–dedicated, by permission, to His\nHoliness Pope Clemens XIII, and based on the documents which led to the\nsaint’s beatification. Altogether, a remarkable volume-----”",
        "And he paused awhile. Then continued:",
        "“I possess a cheaper biography of him, also with a frontispiece, by\nMontanari, which has the questionable advantage of being printed as\nrecently as 1853. And here is yet another one, by Antonio Basile–oh, he\nhas been much written about; a most celebrated taumaturgo,\n(wonder-worker)! As to this Life of 1767, I could not, with a good\nconscience, appraise it at less than five francs.”",
        "“I respect your feelings. But–five francs! I have certain scruples of\nmy own, you know, and it irks my sense of rectitude to pay five francs\nfor the flying monk unless you can supply me with six or seven\nadditional books to be included in that sum.",
        "“Twelve soldi (sous) apiece–that strikes me as the proper price of\nsuch literature, for foreigners, at least. Therefore I’ll have the great\nEgidio as well, and Montanari’s life of the flying monk, and that other\none by Basile, and Giangiuseppe, and-----”",
        "“By all means! Pray take your choice.”",
        "And so it came about that, relieved of a tenuous and very sticky\nfive-franc note, and loaded down with three biographies of the flying\nmonk, one of Egidio, two of Giangiuseppe–I had been hopelessly\nswindled, but there! no man can bargain in a hurry, and my eagerness to\nlearn something of the life of this early airman had made me oblivious\nof the natural values of things–and with sundry smaller volumes of\nsimilar import bulging out of my pockets I turned in the direction of\nthe hotel, promising myself some new if not exactly light reading.",
        "But hardly had I proceeded twenty paces before the shopkeeper came\nrunning after me with another formidable bundle under his arm. More\nbooks! An ominous symptom–the clearest demonstration of my defeat; I\nwas already a marked man, a good customer. It was humiliating, after my\nlong years’ experience of the south.",
        "And there resounded an unmistakable note of triumph in his voice, as he\nsaid:",
        "“Some more biographies, sir. Read them at your leisure, and pay me what\nyou like. You cannot help being generous; I see it in your face.”",
        "“I always try to encourage polite learning, if that is what you think to\ndecipher in my features. But it rains santi this morning,” I added,\nrather sourly.",
        "“The gentleman is pleased to joke! May it rain soldi tomorrow.”",
        "“A little shower, possibly. But not a cloud-burst, like today. . . .”",
        "As to the flying monk, there is no doubt whatever that he deserved his\nname. He flew. Being a monk, these feats of his were naturally confined\nto convents and their immediate surroundings, but that does not alter\nthe facts of the case.",
        "Of the flights that he took in the little town of Copertino-alone, more\nthan seventy, says Father Rossi whom I follow throughout, are on record\nin the depositions which were taken on oath from eye-witnesses after his\ndeath. This is one of them, for example:",
        "“Stupendous likewise was the ratto (flight or rapture) which he\nexhibited on a night of Holy Thursday. . . . He suddenly flew towards\nthe altar in a straight line, leaving untouched all the ornaments of\nthat structure; and after some time, being called back by his superior,\nreturned flying to the spot whence he had set out.”",
        "And another:",
        "“He flew similarly upon an olive tree . . . and there remained in\nkneeling posture for the space of half an hour. A marvellous thing it\nwas to see the branch which sustained him swaying lightly, as though a\nbird had alighted upon it.”",
        "But Copertino is a remote little place, already famous in the annals of\nmiraculous occurrences. It can be urged that a kind of enthusiasm for\ntheir distinguished brother-monk may have tempted the inmates of the\nconvent to exaggerate his rare gifts. Nothing of the kind. He performed\nflights not only in Copertino, but in various large towns of Italy, such\nas Naples, Rome, and Assisi. And the spectators were by no means an\nassemblage of ignorant personages, but men whose rank and credibility\nwould have weight in any section of society.",
        "“While the Lord High Admiral of Castille, Ambassador of Spain at the\nVatican, was passing through Assisi in the year 1645, the custodian of\nthe convent commanded Joseph to descend from the room into the church,\nwhere the Admiral’s lady was waiting for him, desirous of seeing him.\nand speaking to him; to whom Joseph replied, ’I will obey, but I do not\nknow whether I shall be able to speak to her.’ And, as a matter of fact,\nhardly had he entered the church and raised his eyes to a statue . . .\nsituated above the altar, when he threw himself into a flight in order\nto embrace its feet at a distance of twelve paces, passing over the\nheads of all the congregation; then, after remaining there some time, he\nflew back over them with his usual cry, and immediately returned to his\ncell. The Admiral was amazed, his wife fainted away, and all the\nonlookers became piously terrified.”",
        "And if this does not suffice to win credence, the following will\nassuredly do so:",
        "“And since it was God’s wish to render him marvellous even in the sight\nof men of the highest sphere, He ordained that Joseph, having arrived in\nRome, should be conducted one day by the Father-General (of the\nFranciscan Order) to kiss the feet of the High Pontiff, Urban the\nEighth; in which act, while contemplating Jesus Christ in the person of\nHis Vicar, he was ecstatically raised in air, and thus remained till\ncalled back by the General, to whom His Holiness, highly astonished,\nturned and said that ’if Joseph were to die during his pontificate, he\nhimself would bear witness to this successo.’”",
        "But his most remarkable flights took place at Fossombrone, where once\n\"detaching himself in swiftest manner from the altar with a cry like\nthunder, he went, like lightning, gyrating hither and thither about the\nchapel, and with such an impetus that he made all the cells of the\ndormitory tremble, so that the monks, issuing thence in consternation,\ncried, ’An earthquake! An earthquake!’” Here, too, he cast a young sheep\ninto the air, and took flight after it to the height of the trees, where\nhe “remained in kneeling posture, ecstatic and with extended arms, for\nmore than two hours, to the extraordinary marvel of the clergy who\nwitnessed this.” This would seem to have been his outdoor record–two\nhours without descent to earth.",
        "Sometimes, furthermore, he took a passenger, if such a term can properly\nbe applied.",
        "So once, while the monks were at prayers, he was observed to rise up and\nrun swiftly towards the Confessor of the convent, and “seizing him by\nthe hand, he raised him from the ground by supernatural force, and with\njubilant rapture drew him along, turning him round and round in a\nviolento ballo; the Confessor moved by Joseph, and Joseph by God.”",
        "And what happened at Assisi is still more noteworthy, for here\nwas a gentleman, a suffering invalid, whom Joseph “snatched by the hair,\nand, uttering his customary cry of ’oh!’ raised himself from the earth,\nwhile he drew the other after him by his hair, carrying him in this\nfashion for a short while through the air, to the intensest admiration\nof the spectators.” The patient, whose name was Chevalier Baldassarre,\ndiscovered, on touching earth again, that he had been cured by this\nflight of a severe nervous malady which had hitherto afflicted him. . . .",
        "Searching in the biography for some other interesting traits of Saint\nJoseph of Copertino, I find, in marked contrast to his heaven-soaring\nvirtues, a humility of the profoundest kind. Even as a full-grown man he\nretained the exhilarating, childlike nature of the pure in heart. “La\nMamma mia“–thus he would speak, in playful-saintly fashion, of the\nMother of God–”la Mamma mia is capricious. When I bring Her flowers,\nShe tells me She does not want them; when I bring Her candles, She also\ndoes not want them; and when I ask Her what She wants, She says, ’I\nwant the heart, for I feed only on hearts.’” What wonder if the “mere\npronouncement of the name of Maria often sufficed to raise him from the\nground into the air”?",
        "Nevertheless, the arch-fiend was wont to creep into his cell at night\nand to beat and torture him; and the monks of the convent were terrified\nwhen they heard the hideous din of echoing blows and jangling chains.\n\"We were only having a little game,” he would then say. This is\nrefreshingly boyish. He once induced a flock of sheep to enter the\nchapel, and while he recited to them the litany, it was observed with\namazement that “they responded at the proper place to his verses–he\nsaying Sancta Maria, and they answering, after their manner, Bah!”",
        "I am not disguising from myself that an incident like the last-named may\nsmack of childishness to a certain austere type of northern Puritan.\nChildishness! But to go into this question of the relative hilarity and\nmoroseness of religions would take us far afield; for aught I know it\nmay, at bottom, be a matter of climatic influences, and there we can\nleave it. Under the sunny sky of Italy, who would not be disposed to see\nthe bright side of things?",
        "Saint Joseph of Copertino performed a variety of other miracles. He\nmultiplied bread and wine, calmed a tempest, drove out devils, caused\nthe lame to walk and the blind to see–all of which are duly attested by\neye-witnesses on oath. Though “illiterate,” he had an innate knowledge\nof ecclesiastical dogma; he detected persons of impure life by their\nsmell, and sinners were revealed to his eyes with faces of black colour\n(the Turks believe that on judgment day the damned will be thus marked);\nhe enjoyed the company of two guardian angels, which were visible not\nonly to himself but to other people. And, like all too many saints, he\nduly fell into the clutches of the Inquisition, ever on the look-out for\nvictims pious or otherwise.",
        "There is one little detail which it would be disingenuous to slur over.\nIt is this. We are told that Saint Joseph was awkward and backward in\nhis development. As a child his boy-comrades used to laugh at him for\nhis open-mouthed staring habits; they called him “bocca-aperta\"\n(gape-mouth), and in the frontispiece to Montanari’s life of him, which\ndepicts him as a bearded man of forty or fifty, his mouth is still\nagape; he was, moreover, difficult to teach, and Rossi says he profited\nvery little by his lessons and was of niuna letteratura. As a lad of\nseventeen he could not distinguish white bread from brown, and he used\nto spill water-cans, break vases and drop plates to such an extent that\nthe monks of the convent who employed him were obliged, after eight\nmonths’ probation, to dismiss him from their service. He was unable to\npass his examination as priest. At the age of twenty-five he was\nordained by the Bishop of Castro, without that formality.",
        "All this points to a certain weak-mindedness or arrested development,\nand were this an isolated case one might be inclined to think that the\nchurch had made Saint Joseph an object of veneration on the same\nprinciples as do the Arabs, who elevate idiots, epileptics, and\notherwise deficient creatures to the rank of marabouts, and credit them\nwith supernatural powers.",
        "But it is not an isolated case. The majority of these southern saints\nare distinguished from the vulgar herd by idiosyncrasies to which modern\nphysicians give singular names such as “gynophobia,” “glossolalia” and\n\"demonomania\"; [Footnote: Good examples of what Max Nordau calls\nEcholalie are to be found in this biography (p. 22).] even the founder\nof the flying monk’s order, the great Francis of Assisi, has been\naccused of some strange-sounding mental disorder because, with touching\nhumility, he doffed his vestments and presented himself naked before his\nCreator. What are we to conclude therefrom?",
        "The flying monk resembles Saint Francis in more than one feature. He,\ntoo, removed his clothes and even his shirt, and exposed himself thus to\na crucifix, exclaiming, “Here I am, Lord, deprived of everything.” He\nfollowed his prototype, further, in that charming custom of introducing\nthe animal world into his ordinary talk (\"Brother Wolf, Sister Swallow,\"\netc.). So Joseph used to speak of himself as l’asinelio–the little\nass; and a pathetic scene was witnessed on his death-bed when he was\nheard to mutter: “L’asinelio begins to climb the mountain;\nl’asinelio is half-way up; l’asinelio has reached the summit;\nl’asinelio can go no further, and is about to leave his skin behind.”",
        "It is to be noted, in this connection, that Saint Joseph of Coper-tino\nwas born in a stable.",
        "This looks like more than a mere coincidence. For the divine Saint\nFrancis was likewise born in a stable.",
        "But why should either of these holy men be born in stables?",
        "A reasonable explanation lies at hand. A certain Japanese statesman is\ncredited with that shrewd remark that the manifold excellencies and\ndiversities of Hellenic art are due to the fact that the Greeks had no\n\"old masters” to copy from–no “schools” which supplied their\nimagination with ready-made models that limit and smother individual\ninitiative. And one marvels to think into what exotic beauties these\nsouthern saints would have blossomed, had they been at liberty, like\nthose Greeks, freely to indulge their versatile genius–had they not\nbeen bound to the wheels of inexorable precedent. If the flying monk,\nfor example, were an ordinary mortal, there was nothing to prevent him\nfrom being born in an omnibus or some other of the thousand odd places\nwhere ordinary mortals occasionally are born. But–no! As a Franciscan\nsaint, he was obliged to conform to the school of Bethlehem and Assisi.\nHe was obliged to select a stable. Such is the force of tradition. . . .",
        "Joseph of Copertino lived during the time of the Spanish viceroys, and\nhis fame spread not only over all Italy, but to France, Germany and\nPoland. Among his intimates and admirers were no fewer than eight\ncardinals, Prince Leopold of Tuscany, the Duke of Bouillon, Isabella of\nAustria, the Infanta Maria of Savoy and the Duke of Brunswick, who,\nduring a visit to various courts of Europe in 1649, purposely went to\nAssisi to see him, and was there converted from the Lutheran heresy by\nthe spectacle of one of his flights. Prince Casimir, heir to the throne\nof Poland, was his particular friend, and kept up a correspondence with\nhim after the death of his father and his own succession to the throne.",
        "Towards the close of his life, the flying monk became so celebrated that\nhis superiors were obliged to shut him up in the convent of Osimo, in\nclose confinement, in order that his aerial voyages “should not be\ndisturbed by the concourse of the vulgar.” And here he expired, in his\nsixty-first year, on the 18th September, 1663. He had been suffering and\ninfirm for some little time previous to that event, but managed to take\na short flight on the very day preceding his demise.",
        "Forthwith the evidences of his miraculous deeds were collected and\nsubmitted to the inspired examination of the Sacred Congregation of\nRites in Rome. Their conscientiousness in sifting and weighing the\ndepositions is sufficiently attested by the fact that ninety years were\nallowed to elapse ere Joseph of Copertino was solemnly received into the\nnumber of the Blessed. This occurred in 1753; and though the date may\nhave been accidentally chosen, some people will be inclined to detect\nthe hand of Providence in the ordering of the event, as a challenge to\nVoltaire, who was just then disquieting Europe with certain doctrines of\na pernicious nature.",
        "The railway line to Grottaglie skirts the shore of the inland sea for\ntwo or three miles, and then turns away. Old Taranto glimmers in lordly\nfashion across the tranquil waters; a sense of immemorial culture\npervades this region of russet tilth, and olives, and golden corn.",
        "They led me, at Grottaglie, to the only convent of males now in use, San\nFrancesco, recently acquired by the Jesuits. In the sacristy of its\nchurch, where I was told to wait, a slender young priest was praying\nrapturously before some image, and the clock that stood at hand recorded\nthe flight of twenty minutes ere his devotions were ended. Then he arose\nslowly and turned upon me a pair of lustrous, dreamy eyes, as though\nawakened from another world.",
        "This was quite a new convent, he explained; it could not possibly be the\none I was seeking. But there was another one, almost a ruin, and now\nconverted into a refuge for a flock of poor old women; he would gladly\nshow me the way. Was I a “Germanese”? [Footnote: Germanese or\nAllemanno = a German. Tedesco, hereabouts, signifies an Austrian–a\ndetested nationality, even at this distance of time. I have wondered,\nsince writing the above, whether this is really the place of which Rossi\nspeaks. He calls it Grottole (the difference in spelling would be of\nlittle account), and says it lies not far distant from Copertino. But\nthere may be a place of this name still nearer; it is a common\nappellation in these honeycombed limestone districts. This Grottaglie\nis certainly the birth-place of another religious hero, the\npriest-brigand Ciro, who gave so much trouble to Sir R. Church.] No, I\nreplied; I came from Scotland.",
        "“A Calvinist,” he remarked, without bitterness.",
        "“A Presbyterian,” I gently corrected.",
        "“To be sure–a Presbyterian.”",
        "As we walked along the street under the glowing beams of midday I set\nforth the object of my visit. He had never heard of the flying monk–it\nwas astonishing, he said. He would look up the subject without delay.\nThe flying monk! That a Protestant should come all the way from “the\nother end of the world” to enquire about a local Catholic saint of\nwhose existence he himself was unaware, seemed not so much to surprise\nas positively to alarm him.",
        "Among other local curiosities, he pointed out the portal of the parish\nchurch, a fine but dilapidated piece of work, with a large rosette\nwindow overhead. The town, he told me, derives its name from certain\nlarge grottoes wherein the inhabitants used to take refuge during\nSaracen raids. This I already knew, from the pages of Swinburne and\nSanchez; and in my turn was able to inform him that a certain Frenchman,\nBertaux by name, had written about the Byzantine wall-paintings within\nthese caves. Yes, those old Greeks! he said. And that accounted for the\nfamous ceramics of the place, which preserved the Hellenic traditions in\nextraordinary purity. I did not inform him that Hector Preconi, who\npurposely visited Grottaglie to study these potteries, was considerably\ndisappointed.",
        "At the door of the decayed convent my guide left me, with sundry polite\nexpressions of esteem. I entered a spacious open courtyard; a well stood\nin the centre of a bare enclosure whereon, in olden days, the monks may\nhave cultivated their fruit and vegetables; round this court there ran\nan arched passage, its walls adorned with frescoes, now dim and faded,\ndepicting sacred subjects. The monastery itself was a sombre maze of\nstairways and cells and corridors–all the free spaces, including the\nvery roof, encumbered with gleaming potteries of every shape and size,\nthat are made somewhere near the premises.",
        "I wandered about this sunless and cobwebby labyrinth, the old woman\npensioners flitting round me like bats in the twilight. I peered into\nmany dark closets; which of them was it–Joseph’s famous\nblood-bespattered cell?",
        "“He tormented his body so continuously and obstinately with pins,\nneedles and blades of steel, and with such effusion of blood, that even\nnow, after entire years, the walls of his cell and other places of\nretirement are discoloured and actually encrusted with blood.” Which of\nthem was it–the chamber that witnessed these atrocious macerations? It\nwas all so gloomy and forlorn.",
        "Then, pushing aside a door in these tenebrous regions, I suddenly found\nmyself bathed in dazzling light. A loggia opened here, with a view over\nstretches of gnarled olives, shining all silvery under the immaculate\nsky of noonday and bounded by the sapphire belt of the Ionian. Sunshine\nand blue sea! Often must the monks have taken pleasure in this fair\nprospect; and the wiser among them, watching the labourers returning\nhome at nightfall, the children at play, and all the happy life of a\nworld so alien to their own, may well have heaved a sigh.",
        "Meanwhile a crowd of citizens had assembled below, attracted by the\nunusual novelty of a stranger in their town. The simple creatures\nappeared to regard my investigations in the light of a good joke; they\nhad heard of begging monks, and thieving monks, and monks of another\nvariety whose peculiarities I dare not attempt to describe; but a flying\nmonk–no, never!",
        "“The Dark Ages,” said one of them–the mayor, I dare say–with an air of\ngrave authority. “Believe me, dear sir, the days of such fabulous\nmonsters are over.”",
        "So they seem to be, for the present.",
        "No picture or statue records the life of this flying wonder, this\nmasterpiece of Spanish priestcraft; no mural tablet–in this land of\ncommemorative stones–has been erected to perpetuate the glory of his\nsignal achievements; no street is called after him. It is as if he had\nnever existed. On the contrary, by a queer irony of fate, the roadway\nleading past his convent evokes the memory of a misty heathen poet,\nlikewise native of these favoured regions, a man whose name Joseph of\nCopertino had assuredly never heard–Ennius, of whom I can now recall\nnothing save that one unforgettable line which begins “O Tite tute Tati\ntibi-----\"; Ennius, who never so much as tried to fly, but contented\nhimself with singing, in rather bad Latin, of the things of this earth.",

        "It is the swing of the pendulum. The old pagan, at this moment, may be\nnearer to our ideals and aspirations than the flying monk who died only\nyesterday, so to speak.",
        "But a few years hence–who can tell?",
        "A characteristic episode. I had carefully timed myself to catch the\nreturning train to Tarante. Great was my surprise when, half-way to the\nstation, I perceived the train swiftly approaching. I raced it, and\nmanaged to jump into a carriage just as it drew out of the station. The\nguard straightway demanded my ticket and a fine for entering the train\nwithout one (return tickets, for weighty reasons of “internal\nadministration,” are not sold). I looked at my watch, which showed that\nwe had left six minutes before the scheduled hour. He produced his; it\ncoincided with my own. “No matter,” he said. “I am not responsible for\nthe eccentricities of the driver, who probably had some urgent private\naffairs to settle at Taranto. The fine must be paid.” A fellow-passenger\ntook a more charitable view of the case. He suggested that an inspector\nof the line had been travelling along with us, and that the driver,\nknowing this, was naturally ambitious to show how fast he could go.",
        "A mile or so before reaching Tarante the railway crosses a stream that\nflows into the inland sea. One would be glad to believe those sages who\nhold it to be the far-famed Galaesus. It rises near at hand in a marsh,\namid mighty tufts of reeds and odorous flowers, and the liquid bubbles\nup in pools of crystalline transparency–deep and perfidious cauldrons\noverhung by the trembling soil on which you stand. These fountains form\na respectable stream some four hundred yards in length; another copious\nspring rises up in the sea near its mouth. But can this be the river\nwhose virtues are extolled by: Virgil, Horace, Martial, Statius,\nPropertius, Strabo, Pliny, Varro and Coramella? What a constellation of\nnames around these short-lived waters! Truly, minuit praesentia\nfamam, as Boccaccio says of the once-renowned Sebethus.",
        "Often have I visited this site and tried to reconstruct its vanished\nglories. My enthusiasm even led me, some years ago, to the town hall, in\norder to ascertain its true official name, and here they informed me\nthat “it is vulgarly called Citrezze; but the correct version is ’Le\nGiadrezze,’ which, as you are aware, sir, signifies pleasantness”\nThis functionary was evidently ignorant of the fact that so long ago as\n1771 the learned commentator (Carducci) of the “Delizie Tarentine\"\nalready sneered at this popular etymology; adding, what is of greater\ninterest, that “in the time of our fathers” this region was covered with\nwoods and rich in game. In the days of Keppel Craven, the vale was\n\"scantily cultivated with cotton.” Looking at it from above, it\ncertainly resembles an old river-bed of about five hundred yards in\nbreadth, and I hold it possible that the deforestation of the higher\nlands may have suffocated the original sources with soil carried down\nfrom thence, and forced them to seek a lower level, thus shortening the\nstream and reducing its volume of water.",
        "But who shall decide? If we follow Polybius, another brook at the\nfurther end of the inland sea has more valid claims to the title of\nGalaesus. Virgil called it “black Galaesus “–a curious epithet, still\napplied to water in Italy as well as in Greece (Mavromati, etc.). “For\nme,” says Gissing, “the Galaesus is the stream I found and tracked,\nwhose waters I heard mingle with the little sea.” There is something to\nbe said for such an attitude, on the part of a dilettante traveller,\ntowards these desperate antiquarian controversies.",
        "It is an agreeable promenade from the Giadrezze rivulet to Taranto along\nthe shore of this inland sea. Its clay banks are full of shells and\npotteries of every age, and the shallow waters planted with stakes\nindicating the places where myriads of oysters and mussels are\nbred–indeed, if you look at a map you will observe that the whole of\nthis lagoon, as though to shadow forth its signification, is split up\ninto two basins like an opened oyster.",
        "Here and there along this beach are fishermen’s huts constructed of\ntree-stems which are smothered under multitudinous ropes of grass, ropes\nof all ages and in every stage of decomposition, some fairly fresh,\nothers dissolving once more into amorphous bundles of hay. There is a\nsmack of the stone ages, of primeval lake-dwellings, about these\nshelters on the deserted shore; two or three large fetichistic stones\nstand near their entrance; wickerwork objects of dark meaning strew the\nground; a few stakes emerge, hard by, out of the placid and oozy waters.\nIn such a cabin, methinks, dwelt those two old fishermen of\nTheocritus–here they lived and slumbered side by side on a couch of sea\nmoss, among the rude implements of their craft.",
        "The habits of these fisherfolk are antique, because the incidents of\ntheir calling have remained unchanged. Some people have detected traces\nof “Greek” in the looks and language of these of Tarante. I can detect\nnothing of the kind.",
        "And the same with the rest of the population. Hellenic traits have\ndisappeared from Tarante, as well they may have done, when one remembers\nits history. It was completely latinized under Augustus, and though\nByzantines came hither under Nicephorus Phocas–Benjamin of Tudela says\nthe inhabitants are “Greeks\"–they have long ago become merged into\nthe Italian element. Only the barbers seem to have preserved something\nof the old traditions: grandiloquent and terrible talkers, like the\ncooks in Athenasus.",
        "I witnessed an Aristophanic scene in one of their shops lately, when a\nsimple-minded stranger, a north Italian–some arsenal official–brought\na little boy to have his hair cut “not too short” and, on returning\nfrom a brief visit to the tobacconist next door, found it cropped much\ncloser than he liked.",
        "“But, damn it,” he said (or words to that effect), “I told you not to\ncut the hair too short.”",
        "The barber, immaculate and imperturbable, gave a preliminary bow. He was\ncollecting his thoughts, and his breath.",
        "“I say, I told you not to cut it too short. It looks horrible-----\"\n\"Horrible? That, sir–pardon my frankness!–is a matter of opinion. I\nfully admit that you desired the child’s hair to be cut not too short.\nThose, in fact, were your very words. Notwithstanding, I venture to\nthink you will come round to my point of view, on due reflection, like\nmost of my esteemed customers. In the first place, there is the\nethnological aspect of the question. You are doubtless sufficiently\nversed in history to know that under the late regime it was considered\nimproper, if not criminal, to wear a moustache. Well, nowadays we think\ndifferently. Which proves that fashions change; yes, they change, sir;\nand the wise man bends to them–up to a certain point, of course; up to\na certain reasonable point-----” “But, damn it-----”",
        "“And in favour of my contention that hair should be worn short nowadays,\nI need only cite the case of His Majesty the King, whose august head, we\nall know, is clipped like that of a racehorse. Horrible (as you call it)\nor not, the system has momentarily the approval of royalty, and that\nalone should suffice for all loyal subjects to deem it not unworthy of\nimitation. Next, there are what one might describe as hygienic and\nclimatic considerations. Summer is approaching, sir, and apart from\ncertain unpleasant risks which I need not specify, you will surely agree\nwith me that the solstitial heat is a needlessly severe trial for a boy\nwith long hair. My own children are all cropped close, and I have reason\nto think they are grateful for it. Why not yours? Boys may differ in\nstrength or complexion, in moral character and mental attainments, but\nthey are remarkably unanimous as to what constitutes personal comfort.\nAnd it is obviously the duty of parents to consult the personal comfort\nof their offspring–within certain reasonable limits, of course-----”",
        "“But-----”",
        "“Lastly, we come to the much-debated point: I mean the aesthetic side of\nthe matter. No doubt, to judge by some old pictures such as those of the\nrenowned Mantegna, there must have been a time when men thought long\nhair in children rather beautiful than otherwise. And I am not so\nrigorous as to deny a certain charm to these portraits–a charm which is\nlargely due I fancy, to the becoming costumes of the period. At the same\ntime-----”",
        "The stranger did not trust himself to listen any longer. He threw down a\ncoin and walked out of the shop with his son, muttering something not\nvery complimentary to the barber’s female relations.",
        "But the other was quite unmoved. “And after all,” he continued,\naddressing the half-opened door through which his visitor had fled, “the\ntrue question is this: What is ’too short’? Don’t cut it too short,\nyou said. Che vuol dire? An ambiguous phrase!",
        "“Too short for one man may be too long for another. Everything is\nrelative. Yes, gentlemen” (turning to myself and his shop-assistant),\n\"everything on this earth is relative.”",
        "With this sole exception, I have hitherto garnered no Hellenic traits in\nTaranto.",
        "Visible even from Giadrezze, on the other side of the inland sea and\nbeyond the arsenal, there stands a tall, solitary palm. It is the last,\nthe very last, or almost the very last, of a race of giants that adorned\nthe gardens which have now been converted into the “New Quarter.” I\nimagine it is the highest existing palm in Italy, and am glad to have\ntaken a likeness of it, ere it shall have been cut down like the rest of\nits fellows. Taranto was once celebrated for these queenly growths,\nwhich the Saracens brought over from their flaming Africa.",
        "The same fate has overtaken the trees of the Villa Beaumont, which used\nto be a shady retreat, but was bought by the municipality and forthwith\n\"pulizzato\"–i.e. cleaned. This is in accordance with that\nmutilomania of the south: that love of torturing trees which causes\nthem to prune pines till they look like paint-brushes that had been out\nall night, and which explains their infatuation for the much-enduring\nrobinia that allows itself to be teased into any pattern suggested by\ntheir unhealthy phantasy. It is really as if there were something\noffensive to the Latin mind in the sight of a well-grown tree, as if man\nalone had the right of expanding normally. But I must not do the City\nFathers an injustice. They have planted two rows of cryp-tomerias. Will\npeople never learn that cryptomerias cannot flourish in south Italy?\nInstead of this amateurish gardening, why not consult some competent\nprofessional, who with bougain-villeas, hibiscus and fifty other such\nplants would soon transform this favoured spot into a miniature paradise?",
        "The Villa Beaumont and the road along the Admiralty canal are now the\ncitizens’ chief places of disport. Before the year 1869 the Corso\nVittorio Emmanuele, that skirts the sea on the south side of the old\ntown, was their sole promenade. And even this street was built only a\nshort time ago. Vainly one conjectures where the medieval Tarentines\ntook the air. It must have been like Manfredonia at the present day.",
        "This Corso, which has a most awkward pavement and is otherwise\ndisagreeable as looking due south, becomes interesting after sunset.\nHere you may see the young bloods of Taranto leaning in rows against the\nrailing with their backs to the sea–they are looking across the road\nwhence, from balconies and windows, the fair sex are displaying their\ncharms. Never a word is spoken. They merely gaze at each other like\nlovesick puppies; and after watching the performance for several\nevenings, I decided in favour of robuster methods–I decided that\ncourtship, under conditions such as the Corso supplies, can only be\npursued by the very young or the hopelessly infatuated. But in the\nsouth, this gazing is only part of a huge game. They are not really in\nlove at all, these excellent young men–not at all, at all; they know\nbetter. They are only pretending, because it looks manly.",
        "We must revise our conceptions as to the love-passions of these\nsoutherners; no people are more fundamentally sane in matters of the\nheart; they have none of our obfuscated sentimentality; they are seldom\nnaively enamoured, save in early stages of life. It is then that small\ngirls of eight or ten may be seen furtively recording their feelings on\nthe white walls of their would-be lovers’ houses; these archaic scrawls\ngo straight to the point, and are models of what love-letters may\nultimately become, in the time-saving communities of the future. But\nwhen the adolescent and perfumed-pink-paper stage is reached, the\nmissives relapse into barbarous ambiguity; they grow allegorical and\nwilfully exuberant as a Persian carpet, the effigy of a pierced heart at\nthe end, with enormous blood-drops oozing from it, alone furnishing a\nkey to the document.",
        "So far they are in earnest, and it is the girl who takes the lead; her\nyouthful innamorato ties these letters into bundles and returns them\nconscientiously, in due course, to their respective senders. Seldom does\na boy make overtures in love; he gets more of it than he knows what to\ndo with; he is still torpid, and slightly bored by all these attentions.",
        "But presently he wakes up to the fact that he is a man among men, and\nthe obsession of “looking manly” becomes a part of his future artificial\nand rhetorical life-scheme. From henceforth he plays to the gallery.",
        "Reading the city papers, one would think that south Italian youths are\nthe most broken-hearted creatures in the world; they are always trying\nto poison themselves for love. Sometimes they succeed, of course; but\nsometimes–dear me, no! Suicides look manly, that is all. They are part\nof the game. The more sensible youngsters know exactly how much\ncorrosive sublimate to take without immediate fatal consequences,\nallowing for time to reach the nearest hospital. There, the kindly\nphysician and his stomach-pump will perform their duty, and the patient\nwears a feather in his cap for the rest of his life. The majority of\nthese suicides are on a par with French duels–a harmless institution\nwhereby the protagonists honour themselves; they confer, as it were, a\npatent of virility. The country people are as warmblooded as the\ncitizens, but they rarely indulge in suicides because–well, there are\nno hospitals handy, and the doctor may be out on his rounds. It is too\nrisky by half.",
        "And a good proportion of these suicides are only simulated. The wily\nvictim buys some innocuous preparation which sends him into convulsions\nwith ghastly symptoms of poisoning, and, after treatment, remains the\nenviable hero of a mysterious masculine passion. Ask any town\napothecary. A doctor friend of mine lately analysed the results of his\nbenevolent exertions upon a young man who had been seen to drink some\ndreadful liquid out of a bottle, and was carried to his surgery,\nwrithing in most artistic agonies. He found not only no poison, but not\nthe slightest trace of any irritant whatever.",
        "The true courtship of these Don Giovannis of Tarante will be quite\nanother affair–a cash transaction, and no credit allowed. They will\nselect a life partner, upon the advice of ma mere and a strong\ncommittee of uncles and aunts, but not until the military service is\nterminated. Everything in its proper time and place.",
        "Meanwhile they gaze and perhaps even serenade. This looks as if they\nwere furiously in love, and has therefore been included among the rules\nof the game. Youth must keep up the poetic tradition of “fiery.\"\nBesides, it is an inexpensive pastime–the cinematograph costs forty\ncentimes–and you really cannot sit in the barber’s all night long.",
        "But catch them marrying the wrong girl!",
        "POSTSCRIPT.–Here are two samples of youthful love-letters from my\ncollection.",
        "1.–From a disappointed maiden, aged 13. Interesting, because\nintermediate between the archaic and pink-paper stages:",
        "“IDOL OF MY HEART,",
        "“Do not the stars call you when you look to Heaven? Does not the moon\ntell you, the black-cap on the willow when it says farewell to the sun?\nThe birds of nature, the dreary country sadly covered by a few flowers\nthat remain there? Once your look was passionate and pierced me like a\nsunny ray, now it seems the flame of a day. Does nothing tell you of\nimperishable love?” I love you and love you as (illegible) loves its\nliberty, as the corn in the fields loves the sun, as the sailor loves\nthe sea tranquil or stormy. To you I would give my felicity, my future;\nfor one of your words I would spill my blood drop by drop.",
        "“Of all my lovers you are the only ideal consort (consorto) to whom I\nwould give my love and all the expansion of my soul and youthful\nenthusiasm (intusiamo), the greatest enthusiasm (co-tusiamo) my\nheart has ever known. O cruel one who has deigned to put his sweet\npoison in my heart to-day, while to-morrow you will pass me with\nindifference. Cold, proud as ever, serious and disdainful–you\nunderstand? However that may be, I send you the unrepenting cry of my\nrebellious heart: I love you!",
        "“It is late at night, and I am still awake, and at this hour my soul is\nsadder than ever in its great isolation (insolamende); I look on my\npast love and your dear image. Too much I love you and (illegible)\nwithout your affection.",
        "“How sadly I remember your sweet words whispered on a pathetic evening\nwhen everything around was fair and rosy. How happy I then was when life\nseemed radiant with felicity and brightened by your love. And now\nnothing more remains of it; everything is finished. How sad even to say\nit. My heart is shipwrecked far, far away from that happiness which I\nsought.”",
        "(Three further pages of this.)",
        "2.–From a boy of 14 who takes the initiative; such letters are rare.\nNote the business-like brevity.",
        "“DEAR MISS ANNE,",
        "“I write you these few lines to say that I have understood your character\n (carattolo). Therefore, if I may have the honour of being your\nsweetheart, you will let me know the answer at your pleasure. I salute\nyou, and remain,",
        "“Signing myself, “SALVATORE.",
        "“Prompt reply requested!”",
        "One looks into the faces of these Tarentines and listens to their casual\nconversations, trying to unravel what manner of life is theirs. But it\nis difficult to avoid reading into their characters what history leads\none to think should be there.",
        "The upper classes, among whom I have some acquaintance, are mellow and\nenlightened; it is really as if something of the honied spirit of those\nold Greek sages still brooded over them. Their charm lies in the fact\nthat they are civilized without being commercialized. Their politeness\nis unstrained, their suaveness congenital; they remind me of that New\nEngland type which for Western self-assertion substitutes a yielding\ngraciousness of disposition. So it is with persistent gentle upbringing,\nat Taranto and elsewhere. It tones the individual to reposeful\nsweetness; one by one, his anfractuosities are worn off; he becomes as a\npebble tossed in the waters, smooth, burnished, and (to outward\nappearances) indistinguishable from his fellows.",
        "But I do not care about the ordinary city folk. They have an air of\nelaborate superciliousness which testifies to ages of systematic\nhalf-culture. They seem to utter that hopeless word, connu! And what,\nas a matter of fact, do they know? They are only dreaming in their\nlittle backwater, like the oysters of the lagoon, distrustful of\nextraneous matter and oblivious of the movement in a world of men beyond\ntheir shell. You hear next to nothing of “America,” that fruitful source\nof fresh notions; there is no emigration to speak of; the population is\nnot sufficiently energetic–they prefer to stay at home. Nor do they\ncare much about the politics of their own country: one sees less\nnewspapers here than in most Italian towns. “Our middle classes,” said\nmy friend the Italian deputy of whom I have already spoken, “are like\nour mules: to be endurable, they must be worked thirteen hours out of\nthe twelve.” But these have no industries to keep them awake, no sports,\nno ambitions; and this has gone on for long centuries, In Taranto it is\nalways afternoon. “The Tarentines,” says Strabo, “have more holidays\nthan workdays in the year.”",
        "And never was city-population more completely cut off from the country;\nnever was wider gulf between peasant and townsman. There are charming\nwalks beyond the New Quarter–a level region, with olives and figs and\nalmonds and pomegranates standing knee-deep in ripe odorous wheat; but\nthe citizens might be living at Timbuctu for all they know of these\nthings. It rains little here; on the occasion of my last visit not a\ndrop had fallen for fourteen months; and consequently the country\nroads are generally smothered in dust. Now, dusty boots are a scandal\nand an offence in the eyes of the gentle burghers, who accordingly never\nissue out of their town walls. They have forgotten the use of ordinary\nappliances of country life, such as thick boots and walking-sticks; you\nwill not see them hereabouts. Unaware of this idiosyncrasy, I used to\ncarry a stick on my way through the streets into the surroundings, but\nleft it at home on learning that I was regarded as a kind of\nperambulating earthquake. The spectacle of a man clattering through the\nstreets on horseback, such as one often sees at Venosa, would cause them\nto barricade their doors and prepare for the last judgment.",
        "Altogether, essentially nice creatures, lotus-eaters, fearful of fuss or\nnovelty, and drowsily satisfied with themselves and life in general. The\nbreezy healthfulness of travel, the teachings of art or science, the\njoys of rivers and green lanes–all these things are a closed book to\nthem. Their interests are narrowed down to the purely human: a case of\npartial atrophy. For the purely human needs a corrective; it is not\nsufficiently humbling, and that is exactly what makes them so\nsupercilious. We must take a little account of the Cosmos nowadays–it\nhelps to rectify our bearings. They have their history, no doubt. But\nsave for that one gleam of Periclean sunshine the record, though long\nand varied, is sufficiently inglorious and does not testify to undue\nexertions.",
        "A change is at hand.",
        "Gregorovius lamented the filthy condition of the old town. It is now\nspotless.",
        "He deplored that Taranto possessed no museum. This again is changed, and\nthe provincial museum here is justly praised, though the traveller may\nbe annoyed at finding his favourite rooms temporarily closed (is there\nany museum in Italy not “partially closed for alterations”?). New\naccessions to its store are continually pouring in; so they lately\ndiscovered, in a tomb, a Hellenistic statuette of Eros and Aphrodite, 30\ncentimetres high, terra-cotta work of the third century. The goddess\nstands, half-timidly, while Eros alights in airy fashion on her\nshoulders and fans her with his wings–an exquisite little thing.",
        "He was grieved, likewise, that no public collection of books existed\nhere. But the newly founded municipal library is all that can be\ndesired. The stranger is cordially welcomed within its walls and may\nperuse, at his leisure, old Galateus, Giovan Giovene, and the rest of them.",
        "Wandering among those shelves, I hit upon a recent volume (1910) which\ngave me more food for thought than any of these ancients. It is called\n\"Cose di Puglie,” and contains some dozen articles, all by writers of\nthis province of old Calabria, [Footnote: It included the heel of\nItaly.] on matters of exclusively local interest–its history,\nmeteorology, dialects, classical references to the country, extracts\nfrom old economic documents, notes on the development of Apulian\nprinting, examples of modern local caricature, descriptions of mediaeval\nmonuments; a kind of anthology, in short, of provincial lore. The\ntypography, paper and illustrations of this remarkable volume are beyond\nall praise; they would do honour to the best firm in London or Paris.\nWhat is this book? It is no commercial speculation at all; it is a\nwedding present to a newly married couple–a bouquet of flowers, of\nintellectual blossoms, culled from their native Apulian meadows. One\nnotes with pleasure that the happy pair are neither dukes nor princes.\nThere is no trace of snobbishness in the offering, which is simply a\nspontaneous expression of good wishes on the part of a few friends. But\nsurely it testifies to most refined feelings. How immeasurably does this\npermanent and yet immaterial feast differ from our gross wedding\nbanquets and ponderous gilt clocks and tea services! Such persons\ncannot but have the highest reverence for things of the mind; such a\ngift is the fairest efflorescence of civilization. And this is only\nanother aspect of that undercurrent of spirituality in south Italy of\nwhose existence the tourist, harassed by sordid preoccupations, remains\nwholly unaware.",
        "This book was printed at Bari. Bari, not long ago, consisted of a dark\nand tortuous old town, exactly like the citadel of Taranto. It has now\nits glaring New Quarter, not a whit less disagreeable than the one here.\nWhy should Taranto not follow suit in the matter of culture? Heraclea,\nSybaris and all the Greek settlements along this coast have vanished\nfrom earth; only Taranto and Cotrone have survived to carry on, if they\ncan, the old traditions. They have survived, thanks to peculiar physical\nconditions that have safeguarded them from invaders. . . .",
        "But these very conditions have entailed certain drawbacks–drawbacks\nwhich Buckle would have lovingly enumerated to prove their influence\nupon the habits and disposition of the Tarentines. That marine situation\n. . . only think of three thousand years of scirocco, summer and winter!\nIt is alone enough to explain molle Tarentum– enough to drain the\nenergy out of a Newfoundland puppy! And then, the odious dust of the\ncountry roadways–for it is odious. Had the soil been granitic, or\neven of the ordinary Apennine limestone, the population might have\nremained in closer contact with wild things of nature, and retained a\nperennial fountain of enjoyment and inspiration. A particular kind of\nrock, therefore, has helped to make them sluggish and incurious. The\ninsularity of their citadel has worked in the same direction, by\nfocussing their interests upon the purely human. That inland sea, again:\nwere it not an ideal breeding-place for shell-fish, the Tarentines would\nlong ago have learnt to vary their diet. Thirty centuries of\nmussel-eating cannot but impair the physical tone of a people.",
        "And had the inland sea not existed, the Government would not have been\ntempted to establish that arsenal which has led to the erection of the\nnew town and consequent municipal exactions. “The arsenal,” said a\ngrumbling old boatman to me, “was the beginning of our purgatory.” A\nmilk diet would work wonders with the health and spirits of the\ncitizens. But since the building of the new quarter, such a diet has\nbecome a luxury; cows and goats will soon be scarce as the megatherium.\nThere is a tax of a franc a day on every cow, and a herd of ten goats,\nbarely enough to keep a poor man alive, must pay annually 380 francs in\noctroi. These and other legalized robberies, which among a more virile\npopulace would cause the mayor and town council to be forthwith attached\nto the nearest lamp-post, are patiently borne. It is imbelle\nTarentum– a race without grit.",
        "I would also recommend the burghers some vegetables, so desirable for\ntheir sedentary habits, but there again! it seems to be a peculiarity of\nthe local soil to produce hardly a leaf of salad or cabbage. Potatoes\nare plainly regarded as an exotic–they are the size of English peas,\nand make me think of Ruskin’s letter to those old ladies describing the\nasparagus somewhere in Tuscany. And all this to the waiter’s undisguised\nastonishment.",
        "“The gentleman is rich enough to pay for meat. Why trouble about this\nkind of food?”...",
        "And yet–a change is at hand. These southern regions are waking up from\ntheir slumber of ages. Already some of Italy’s acutest thinkers and most\nbrilliant politicians are drawn from these long-neglected shores. For we\nmust rid ourselves of that incubus of “immutable race characters”: think\nonly of our Anglo-Saxon race! What has the Englishman of to-day in\ncommon with that rather lovable fop, drunkard and bully who would faint\nwith ecstasy over Byron’s Parisina after pistolling his best friend\nin a duel about a wench or a lap-dog? Such differences as exist between\nraces of men, exist only at a given moment.",
        "And what, I sometimes ask myself–what is now the distinguishing feature\nbetween these southern men and ourselves? Briefly this, I think. In\nmundane matters, where the personal equation dominates, their judgment\nis apt to be turbid and perverse; but as one rises into questions of\npure intelligence, it becomes serenely impartial. We, on the other hand,\nwho are pre-eminently clear-sighted in worldly concerns of law and\ngovernment and in all subsidiary branches of mentality, cannot bring\nourselves to reason dispassionately on non-practical subjects. “L’esprit\naussi a sa pudeur,” says Remy de Gourmont. Well, this pudeur de\nl’esprit, discouraged among the highest classes in England, is the\nhall-mark of respectability hereabouts. A very real difference, at this\nparticular moment. . . .",
        "There is an end of philosophizing.",
        "They have ousted me from my pleasant quarters, the landlady’s son and\ndaughter-in-law having returned unexpectedly and claiming their\napartments. I have taken refuge in a hotel. My peace is gone; my days in\nTaranto are numbered.",
        "Loath to depart, I linger by the beach of the Ionian Sea beyond the new\ntown. It is littered with shells and holothurians, with antique tesserae\nof blue glass and marble fragments, with white mosaic pavements and\npotteries of every age, from the glossy Greco-Roman ware whose\ndelicately embossed shell devices are emblematic of this sea-girt city,\ndown to the grosser products of yesterday. Of marbles I have found\ncipollino, pavonazzetto, giallo and rosso antico, but no harder\nmaterials such as porphyry or serpentine. This, and the fact that the\nmosaics are pure white, suggests that the houses here must have dated,\nat latest, from Augustan times.",
        "[Footnote: Nor is there any of the fashionable verde antico, and\nthis points in the same direction. Corsi says nothing as to the date of\nits introduction, and I have not read the treatise of Silenziario, but\nmy own observations lead me to think that the lapis atracius can\nhardly have been known under Tiberius. Not so those hard ones: they\nimported wholesale by his predecessor Augustus, who was anxious to be\nknown as a scorner of luxury (a favourite pose with monarchs), yet spent\nincalculable sums on ornamental stones both for public and private ends.\nOne is struck by a certain waste of material; either the expense was\ndeliberately disregarded or finer methods of working the stones were not\nyet in vogue. A revolution in the technique of stone-cutting must have\nset in soon after his death, for thenceforward we find the most\nintractable rocks cut into slices thin as card-board: too thin for\npavements, and presumably for encrusting walls and colonnades. The\nAugustans, unable to produce these effects naturally, attempted\nimitation-stones, and with wonderful success. I have a fragment of their\nplaster postiche copying the close-grained Egyptian granite; the oily\nlustre of the quartz is so fresh and the peculiar structure of the rock,\nwith its mica scintillations, so admirably rendered as to deceive, after\ntwo thousand years, the eye of a trained mineralogist.]",
        "Here I sit, on the tepid shingle, listening to the plash of the waves\nand watching the sun as it sinks over the western mountains that are\nveiled in mists during the full daylight, but loom up, at this sunset\nhour, as from a fabulous world of gold. Yonder lies the Calabrian Sila\nforest, the brigands’ country. I will attack it by way of Rossano, and\nthence wander, past Longobucco, across the whole region. It may be well,\nafter all, to come again into contact with streams and woodlands, after\nthis drenching of classical associations and formal civic life!",
        "Near me stands a shore-battery which used to be called “Batteria\nChianca.” It was here they found, some twenty years ago, a fine marble\nhead described as a Venus, and now preserved in the local museum. I\nobserve that this fort has lately been re-christened “Batteria Archyta.\"\nCan this be due to a burst of patriotism for the Greek warrior-sage who\nruled Taranto, or is it a subtle device to mislead the foreign spy?",

But if you wish to see the\nmanufacture of more complicated potteries, you must go to the unclean\nquarter beyond the railway station. Once there, you will not soon weary\nof that potter’s wheel and the fair shapes that blossom forth under its\nenchanted touch.

        "Hardly has the sun disappeared before the lighthouse in the east begins\nto flash. The promontory on which it stands is called San Vito after one\nof the musty saints, now almost forgotten, whose names survive along\nthese shores. Stoutly this venerable one defended his ancient worship\nagainst the radiant and victorious Madonna; nor did she dislodge him\nfrom a certain famous sanctuary save by the questionable expedient of\nadopting his name: she called herself S. M. “della Vita.” That settled\nit. He came from Mazzara in Sicily, whither they still carry, to his\nlonely shrine, epileptics and others distraught in mind. And were I in a\ndiscursive mood, I would endeavour to trace some connection between his\nestablishment here and the tarantella–between St. Vitus’ dance and that\nother one which cured, they say, the bite of the Tarentine spider.",

In 1737 the learned Aceti was able to enumerate\nover two thousand celebrated Calabrians–athletes, generals, musicians,\ncentenarians, inventors, martyrs, ten popes, ten kings, as well as some\nsixty conspicuous women. A land of thinkers. Old Zavarroni, born in\n1705, gives us a list of seven hundred Calabrian writers; and I, for\none, would not care to bring his catalogue up to date.

There groweth Gum, Pitch, Turpentine and liquid Storax. In former\ntimes it was never without Mettals, but at this present it doth much\nabound, having in most parts divers sorts of Mines, as Gold, Silver,\nIron, Marble, Alabaster, Cristal, Marchesite, three sorts of white\nChaulk, Virmilion, Alume, Brimstone, and the Adamant stone, which being\nin the fifth degree, draweth not Iron, and is in colour black. There\ngroweth hemp and flax of two sorts, the one called the male, the other\nthe female: there falleth Manna from heaven, truly a thing very rare;\nand although there is not gathered such abundance of Silk, yet I dare\nsay there is not had so much in all Italy besides. There are also\nbathes, both hot, luke-warm, and cold, to cure many diseases. Near the\nSeaside, and likewise on the Mediterrane are goodly Gardens full of\nOringes, Citrons, and Lemons of divers sorts. It is watered with many\nRivers. There are on the hils of the Apennine, thick Woods of high\nFirrs, Holms, Platanes, Oaks, where grows the white odoriferous Mushrome\nwhich shineth in the night. Here is bred the soft stone Frigia, which\nevery month yields a delicate and wholesome Gum, and the stone\nAetites, by us called the stone Aquilina. In this Province there is\nexcellent hunting of divers creatures, as wild Hoggs, Staggs, Goats,\nHares, Foxes, Porcupines, Marmosets. There are also ravenous beasts, as\nWolves, Bears, Luzards, which are quick-sighted, and have the hinder\nparts spotted with divers colours. This kind of Beast was brought from\nFrance to Rome in the sports of Pompey the great, and Hunters\naffirm this Beast to be of so frail a memory, that although he eateth\nwith hunger, if he chance to look back, remembreth no more his meat, and\ndeparting searcheth for other.” Who would not visit Calabria, if only on\nthe chance of beholding the speckled posterior of the absent-minded\nLuzard?",
        "This short plunge into the jungle was a relief, after the all-too-human\nexperiences of Taranto. The forest of Policoro skirts the Ionian; the\nrailway line cleaves it into two unequal portions, the seaward tract\nbeing the smaller. It is bounded on the west by the river Sinnc, and I\nimagine the place has not changed much since the days when Keppel Craven\nexplored its recesses.",
        "Twilight reigns in this maze of tall deciduous trees. There is thick\nundergrowth, too; and I measured an old lentiscus–a shrub, in\nItaly–which was three metres in circumference. But the exotic feature\nof the grove is its wealth of creeping vines that clamber up the trunks,\nswinging from one tree-top to another, and allowing the merest threads\nof sunlight to filter through their matted canopy. Policoro has the\ntangled beauty of a tropical swamp. Rank odours arise from the decaying\nleaves and moist earth; and once within that verdant labyrinth, you\nmight well fancy yourself in some primeval region of the globe, where\nthe foot of man has never penetrated.",
        "Yet long ago it resounded with the din of battle and the trumpeting of\nelephants–in that furious first battle between Pyrrhus and the Romans.\nAnd here, under the very soil on which you stand, lies buried, they say,\nthe ancient city of Siris.",
        "They have dug canals to drain off the moisture as much as possible, but\nthe ground is marshy in many places and often quite impassable,\nespecially in winter. None the less, winter is the time when a little\nshooting is done here, chiefly wild boars and roe-deer. They are driven\ndown towards the sea, but only as far as the railway line. Those that\nescape into the lower portions are safe for another year, as this is\nnever shot over but kept as a permanent preserve. I have been told that\nred-deer were introduced, ut that the experiment failed; probably the\ncountry was too not and damp. In his account of Calabria, Duret de Tavel\n[Footnote: An English translation of his book appeared in 1832.]\nsometimes speaks of killing the fallow-deer, an autochthonous\nTyrrhenian beast which is now extinct on the mainland in its wild state.\nNor can he be confounding it with the roe, since he mentions the two\ntogether–for instance, in the following note from Corigliano (February,\n1809), which must make the modern Calabrian’s mouth water:",
        "“Game has multiplied to such an extent that the fields are ravaged, and\nwe are rendering a real service in destroying it. I question whether\nthere exists in Europe a country offering more varied species. . . . We\nreturn home followed by carriages and mules loaded with wild boars,\nroe-deer, fallow-deer, hares, pheasants, wild duck, wild geese–to say\nnothing of foxes and wolves, of which we have already killed an immense\nquantity.”",
        "The pheasants seem to have likewise died out, save in royal preserves.\nThey were introduced into Calabria by that mighty hunter Frederick II.",
        "The parcelling out of many of these big properties has been followed by\na destruction of woodland and complete disappearance of game. It is\nhailed as the beginning of a new era of prosperity; and so it well may\nbe, from a commercial point of view. But the traveller and lover of\nnature will be glad to leave some of these wild districts in the hands\nof their rich owners, who have no great interests in cultivating every\ninch of ground, levelling rocky spaces, draining the land and hewing\ndown every tree that fails to bear fruit. Split into peasant\nproprietorships, this forest would soon become a scientifically\nirrigated campagna for the cultivation of tomatoes or what not, like the\n\"Colonia Elena,” near the Pontine Marshes. The national exchequer would\nprofit, without a doubt. But I question whether we should all take the\neconomical point of view–whether it would be wise for humanity to do\nso. There is a prosperity other than material. Some solitary artist or\npoet, drawing inspiration from scenes like this, might have contributed\nmore to the happiness of mankind than a legion of narrow-minded, grimy\nand litigious tomato-planters.",
        "To all appearances, Italy is infected just now with a laudable mania for\nthe “exploitation of natural resources\"–at the expense, of course, of\nwealthy landowners, who are described as withholding from the people\ntheir due. The programme sounds reasonable enough; but one must not\nforget that what one reads on this subject in the daily papers is\nlargely the campaign of a class of irresponsible pressmen and\npoliticians, who exploit the ignorance of weak people to fill their own\npockets. How one learns to loathe, in Italy and in England, that lovely\nword socialism, when one knows a little of the inner workings of the\ncause and a few–just a few!–details of the private lives of these\nunsavoury saviours of their country!",

Such was the anguished\npoverty of the country-folk that up to the eighties of last century they\nused to sell their children by regular contracts, duly attested before\nthe local mayors. But nowadays I listen to their complaints with\ncomparative indifference.",
        "“You are badly treated, my friend? I quite believe it; indeed, I can see\nit. Well, go to Argentina and sell potatoes, or to the mines of\nPennsylvania.

        "For the rest, the domain of Policoro–it is spelt Pelicaro in older\nmaps like those of Magini and Rizzi-Zannone–seems to be well\nadministered, and would repay a careful study. I was not encouraged,\nhowever, to undertake this study, the manager evidently suspecting some\nulterior motive to underlie my simple questions. He was not at all\nresponsive to friendly overtures. Restive at first, he soon waxed\nambiguous, and finally taciturn. Perhaps he thought I was a tax-gatherer\nin disguise. A large structure combining the features of palace,\nfortress and convent occupies an eminence, and is supposed by some to\nstand on the site of old Heracleia; it was erected by the Jesuits; the\nworkpeople live in humble dwellings that cluster around it.

        "You walk to this building from the station along an avenue of eucalypti\nplanted some forty years ago. Detesting, as I do, the whole tribe of gum\ntrees, I never lose an opportunity of saying exactly what I think about\nthis particularly odious representative of the brood, this eyesore, this\ngrey-haired scarecrow, this reptile of a growth with which a pack of\nmisguided enthusiasts have disfigured the entire Mediterranean basin.\nThey have now realized that it is useless as a protection against\nmalaria. Soon enough they will learn that instead of preventing the\ndisease, it actually fosters it, by harbouring clouds of mosquitoes\nunder its scraggy so-called foliage. These abominations may look better\non their native heath: I sincerely hope they do. Judging by the “Dead\nHeart of Australia\"–a book which gave me a nightmare from which I shall\nnever recover–I should say that a varnished hop-pole would be an\nartistic godsend out there.",
        "But from here the intruder should be expelled without mercy. A single\neucalyptus will ruin the fairest landscape. No plant on earth rustles in\nsuch a horribly metallic fashion when the wind blows through those\neverlastingly withered branches; the noise chills one to the marrow; it\nis like the sibilant chattering of ghosts. Its oil is called “medicinal\"\nonly because it happens to smell rather nasty; it is worthless as\ntimber, objectionable in form and hue–objectionable, above all things,\nin its perverse, anti-human habits. What other tree would have the\neffrontery to turn the sharp edges of its leaves–as if these were not\nnarrow enough already!–towards the sun, so as to be sure of giving at\nall hours of the day the minimum of shade and maximum of discomfort to\nmankind?",
        "But I confess that this avenue of Policoro almost reconciled me to the\nexistence of the anaemic Antipodeans. Almost; since for some reason or\nother (perhaps on account of the insufferably foul nature of the soil)\ntheir foliage is here thickly tufted; it glows like burnished bronze in\nthe sunshine, like enamelled scales of green and gold. These eucalypti\nare unique in Italy. Gazing upon them, my heart softened and I almost\nforgave the gums their manifold iniquities, their diabolical thirst,\ntheir demoralizing aspect of precocious senility and vice, their peeling\nbark suggestive of unmentionable skin diseases, and that system of\nradication which is nothing short of a scandal on this side of the\nglobe. . . .",
        "In the exuberance of his joy at the prospect of getting rid of me, the\nmanager of the estate lent me a dog-cart to convey me to the forest’s\nedge, as well as a sleepy-looking boy for a guide, warning me, however,\nnot to put so much as the point of my nose inside the jungle, on account\nof the malaria which has already begun to infect the district. One sees\nall too many wan faces hereabouts. Visible from the intervening plain is\na large building on the summit of a hill; it is called Acinapura, and\nthis is the place I should have gone to, had time permitted, for the\nsake of the fine view which it must afford over the whole Policoro region.",
        "Herds of buffaloes wallow in the mire. An old bull, reposing in solitary\ngrandeur, allowed me so near an approach that I was able to see two or\nthree frogs hopping about his back, and engaged in catching the\nmosquitoes that troubled him. How useful, if something equally efficient\nand inexpensive could be devised for humanity!",
        "We entered the darksome forest. The boy, who had hitherto confined\nhimself to monosyllables, suddenly woke up under its mysterious\ninfluence; he became alert and affable; he related thrilling tales of\nthe outlaws who used to haunt these thickets, lamenting that those happy\ndays were over. There were the makings of a first-class brigand in\nPaolo. I stimulated his brave fancy; and it was finally proposed that I\nshould establish myself permanently with the manager of the estate, so\nthat on Sundays we could have some brigand-sport together, on the sly.",
        "Then out again–into the broad and sunlit bed of the Sinno. The water\nnow ripples in bland content down a waste of shining pebbles. But its\nwintry convulsions are terrific, and higher up the stream, where the\nbanks are steep, many lives are lost in those angry floods that rush\ndown from the hill-sides, filling the riverbed with a turmoil of crested\nwaves. At such moments, these torrents put on new faces. From placid\nwaterways they are transformed into living monsters, Aegirs or dragons,\nthat roll themselves seaward, out of their dark caverns, in tawny coils\nof destruction.",
        "And precisely this angry aspect of the waters has been acclaimed as one\nof the origins of that river-dragon idea which used to be common in\nsouth Italy, before the blight of Spaniardism fell upon the land and\nwithered up the pagan myth-making faculty. There are streams still\nperpetuating this name–the rivulet Dragone, for instance, which falls\ninto the Ionian not far from Cape Colonne.",
        "A non-angry aspect of them has also been suggested as the origin: the\ntortuous wanderings of rivers in the plains, like the Meander, that\nrecall the convolutions of the serpent. For serpent and dragon are apt\nto be synonymous with the ancients.",
        "Both these explanations, I think, are late developments in the evolution\nof the dragon-image. They leave one still puzzling as to what may be the\naboriginal conception underlying this legendary beast of earth and\nclouds and waters. We must go further back.",
        "What is a dragon? An animal, one might say, which looks or regards\n(Greek drakon); so called, presumably, from its terrible eyes. Homer\nhas passages which bear out this interpretation:",
        "[Greek: Smerdaleon de dedorken], etc.",
        "Now the Greeks were certainly sensitive to the expression of animal\neyes–witness “cow-eyed” Hera, or the opprobrious epithet “dog-eyed\";\naltogether, the more we study what is left of their zoological\nresearches, the more we realize what close observers they were in\nnatural history. Aristotle, for instance, points out sexual differences\nin the feet of the crawfish which were overlooked up to a short time\nago. And Hesiod also insists upon the dragon’s eyes. Yet it is\nsignificant that ophis, the snake, is derived, like drakon, from a\nroot meaning nothing more than to perceive or regard. There is no\nconnotation of ferocity in either of the words. Gesner long ago suspected\nthat the dragon was so called simply from its keen or rapid perception.",
        "One likes to search for some existing animal prototype of a fabled\ncreature like this, seeing that to invent such things out of sheer\nnothing is a feat beyond human ingenuity–or, at least, beyond what the\nhistory of others of their kind leads us to expect. It may well be that\nthe Homeric writer was acquainted with the Uromastix lizard that occurs\nin Asia Minor, and whoever has watched this beast, as I have done,\ncannot fail to have been impressed by its contemplative gestures, as if\nit were gazing intently (drakon) at something. It is, moreover, a\n\"dweller in rocky places,” and more than this, a vegetarian–an “eater\nof poisonous herbs” as Homer somewhere calls his dragon. So Aristotle\nsays: “When the dragon has eaten much fruit, he seeks the juice of the\nbitter lettuce; he has been seen to do this.”",
        "Are we tracking the dragon to his lair? Is this the aboriginal beast?\nNot at all, I should say. On the contrary, this is a mere side-issue, to\nfollow which would lead us astray. The reptile-dragon was invented when\nmen had begun to forget what the arch-dragon was; it is the product of a\nlater stage–the materializing stage; that stage when humanity sought to\nexplain, in naturalistic fashion, the obscure traditions of the past. We\nmust delve still deeper. . . .",
        "My own dragon theory is far-fetched–perhaps necessarily so, dragons\nbeing somewhat remote animals. The dragon, I hold, is the\npersonification of the life within the earth–of that life which, being\nunknown and uncontrollable, is eo ipso hostile to man. Let me explain\nhow this point is reached.",
        "The animal which looks or regards. . . . Why–why an animal? Why not\ndrakon = that which looks?",
        "Now, what looks?",
        "The eye.",
        "This is the key to the understanding of the problem, the key to the\nsubterranean dragon-world.",
        "The conceit of fountains or sources of water being things that see\n(drakon)–that is, eyes–or bearing some resemblance to eyes, is common\nto many races. In Italy, for example, two springs in the inland sea near\nTaranto are called “Occhi\"–eyes; Arabs speak of a watery fountain as an\neye; the notion exists in England top–in the “Blentarn” of Cumberland,\nthe blind tarn (tarn = a trickling of tears), which is “blind” because\ndry and waterless, and therefore lacking the bright lustre of the open eye.",
        "There is an eye, then, in the fountain: an eye which looks or regards.\nAnd inasmuch as an eye presupposes a head, and a head without body is\nhard to conceive, a material existence was presently imputed to that\nwhich looked upwards out of the liquid depths. This, I think, is the\nprimordial dragon, the archetype. He is of animistic descent and\nsurvives all over the earth; and it is precisely this universality of\nthe dragon-idea which induces me to discard all theories of local origin\nand to seek for some common cause. Fountains are ubiquitous, and so are\ndragons. There are fountain dragons in Japan, in the superstitions of\nKeltic races, in the Mediterranean basin. The dragon of Wantley lived in\na well; the Lambton Worm began life in fresh water, and only took to\ndry land later on. I have elsewhere spoken of the Manfredonia legend of\nSaint Lorenzo and the dragon, an indigenous fable connected, I suspect,\nwith the fountain near the harbour of that town, and quite independent\nof the newly-imported legend of Saint Michael. Various springs in Greece\nand Italy are called Dragoneria; there is a cave-fountain Dragonara on\nMalta, and another of the same name near Cape Misenum–all are sources\nof apposite lore. The water-drac. . . .",
        "So the dragon has grown into a subterranean monster, who peers up from\nhis dark abode wherever he can–out of fountains or caverns whence\nfountains issue. It stands to reason that he is sleepless; all dragons\nare “sleepless “; their eyes are eternally open, for the luminous\nsparkle of living waters never waxes dim. And bold adventurers may well\nbe devoured by dragons when they fall into these watery rents, never to\nappear again.",
        "Furthermore, since gold and other treasures dear to mankind lie hidden\nin the stony bowels of the earth and are hard to attain, the jealous\ndragon has been accredited with their guardianship–hence the plutonic\nelement in his nature. The dragon, whose “ever-open eye” protected the\ngarden of the Hesperides, was the Son of Earth. The earth or\ncave-dragon. . . . Calabria has some of these dragons’ caves; you can\nread about them in the Campania. Sotteranea of G. Sanchez.",
        "In volcanic regions there are fissures in the rocks exhaling pestiferous\nemanations; these are the spiracula, the breathing-holes, of the\ndragon within. The dragon legends of Naples and Mondragone are probably\nof this origin, and so is that of the Roman Campagna (1660) where the\ndragon-killer died from the effects of this poisonous breath: Sometimes\nthe confined monster issues in a destructive lava-torrent–Bellerophon\nand the Chimsera. The fire-dragon. ... Or floods of water suddenly\nstream down from the hills and fountains are released. It is the hungry\ndragon, rushing from his den in search of prey; the river-dragon. . . .\nHe rages among the mountains with such swiftness and impetuosity.",
        "This is chiefly the poets’ work, though the theologians have added one\nor two embellishing touches. But in whatever shape he appears, whether\nhis eyes have borrowed a more baleful fire from heathen basilisks, or\ntraits of moral evil are instilled into his pernicious physique by\namalgamation with the apocalyptic Beast, he remains the vindictive enemy\nof man and his ordered ways. Of late–like the Saurian tribe in\ngeneral–he has somewhat degenerated. So in modern Greece, by that\nprocess of stultified anthropomorphism which results from grafting\nChristianity upon an alien mythopoesis, he dons human attributes,\ntalking and acting as a man (H. F. Tozer). And here, in Calabria, he\nlingers in children’s fables, as “sdrago,” a mockery of his former self.",
        "To follow up his wondrous metamorphoses through medievalism would be a\npastime worthy of some leisured dilettante. How many noble shapes\nacquired a tinge of absurdity in the Middle Ages! Switzerland alone,\nwith its mystery of untrodden crevices, used to be crammed with\ndragons–particularly the calcareous (cavernous) province of Rhaetia.\nSecondary dragons; for the good monks saw to it that no reminiscences of\nthe autochthonous beast survived. Modern scholars have devoted much\nlearning to the local Tazzelwurm and Bergstutz. But dragons of our\nfamiliar kind were already well known to the chroniclers from whom old\nCysat extracted his twenty-fifth chapter (wherein, by the way, you will\nlearn something of Calabrian dragons); then came J. J. Wagner (1680);\nthen Scheuchzer, prince of dragon-finders, who informs us that multorum\ndraconum historta mendax.",
        "But it is rather a far cry from Calabria to the asthmatic Scheuchzer,\nwiping the perspiration off his brow as he clambers among the Alps to\nrecord truthful dragon yarns and untruthful barometrical observations;\nor to China, dragon-land par excellence; [Footnote: In Chinese\nmythology the telluric element has remained untarnished. The dragon is\nan earth-god, who controls the rain and thunder clouds.] or even to our\nown Heralds’ College, where these and other beasts have sought a refuge\nfrom prying professors under such queer disguises that their own mothers\nwould hardly recognize them.",
        "Exhausted with the morning’s walk at Policoro, a railway journey and a\nlong drive up nearly a thousand feet to Rossano in the heat of midday, I\nsought refuge, contrary to my usual custom, in the chief hotel,\nintending to rest awhile and then seek other quarters. The establishment\nwas described as “ganz ordentlich” in Baedeker. But, alas! I found\nlittle peace or content. The bed on which I had hoped to repose was\nalready occupied by several other inmates. Prompted by curiosity, I\ncounted up to fifty-two of them; after that, my interest in the matter\nfaded away. It became too monotonous. They were all alike, save in point\nof size (some were giants). A Swammerdam would have been grieved by\ntheir lack of variety.",
        "And this, I said to myself, in a renowned city that has given birth to\npoets and orators, to saints like the great Nilus, to two popes\nand–last, but not least–one anti-pope!

Then is the moment to take a seat,\nsmiling affably at the assembled company, but without proffering a\nsyllable. If this etiquette is strictly adhered to, it will not be long\nere you are politely questioned as to your plans, your present\naccommodation, and so forth; and soon several members will be vying with\neach other to procure you a clean and comfortable room at half the price\ncharged in a hotel.",
        "Even when this end is accomplished, my connection with the pharmacy\ncoterie is not severed. I go there from time to time, ostensibly to\ntalk, but in reality to listen. Here one can feel the true pulse of the\nplace. Local questions are dispassionately discussed, with ample forms\nof courtesy and in a language worthy of Cicero. It is the club of the\nelite.",
        "In olden days I used to visit south Italy armed with introductions to\nmerchants, noblemen and landed proprietors. I have quite abandoned that\nsystem, as these people, bless their hearts, have such cordial notions\nof hospitality that from morning to night the traveller has not a moment\nhe can call his own. Letters to persons in authority, such as syndics or\npolice officers, are useless and worse than useless. Like Chinese\nmandarins, these officials are so puffed up with their own importance\nthat it is sheer waste of time to call upon them. If wanted, they can\nalways be found; if not, they are best left alone. For besides being\nusually the least enlightened and least amiable of the populace, they\nare inordinately suspicious of political or commercial designs on the\npart of strangers–God knows what visions are fermenting in their turbid\nbrains–and seldom let you out of their sight, once they have known you.",
        "Excepting at Cosenza, Cotrone and Catanzaro, an average white man will\nseldom find, in any Calabrian hostelry, what he is accustomed to\nconsider as ordinary necessities of life. The thing is easily\nexplicable. These men are not yet in the habit of “handling” civilized\ntravellers; they fail to realize that hotel-keeping is a business to be\nlearnt, like tailoring or politics. They are still in the patriarchal\nstage, wealthy proprietors for the most part, and quite independent of\nyour custom. They have not learnt the trick of Swiss servility. You must\ntherefore be prepared to put up with what looks like very bad treatment.\nOn your entrance nobody moves a step to enquire after your wants; you\nmust begin by foraging for yourself, and thank God if any notice is\ntaken of what you say; it is as if your presence were barely\ntolerated. But once the stranger has learnt to pocket his pride and\ntreat his hosts in the same offhand fashion, he will find among them an\nunconventional courtesy of the best kind.",
        "The establishment being run as a rule by the proprietor’s own family,\ngratuities with a view to exceptional treatment are refused with quiet\ndignity, and even when accepted will not further your interests in the\nleast; on the contrary, you are thenceforward regarded as tactless and\nweak in the head. Discreet praise of their native town or village is the\nbest way to win the hearts of the younger generation; for the parents a\nlittle knowledge of American conditions is desirable, to prove that you\nare a man of the world and worthy, a priori, of some respect. But if\nthere exists a man-cook, he is generally an importation and should be\nperiodically and liberally bribed, without knowledge of the family, from\nthe earliest moment. Wonderful, what a cook can do!",
        "It is customary here not to live en pension or to pay a fixed price\nfor any meal, the smallest item, down to a piece of bread, being\nconscientiously marked against you. My system, elaborated after\nconsiderable experimentation, is to call for this bill every morning\nand, for the first day or two after arrival, dispute in friendly fashion\nevery item, remorselessly cutting down some of them. Not that they\novercharge; their honesty is notorious, and no difference is made in\nthis respect between a foreigner and a native. It is a matter of\nprinciple. By this system, which must not be overdone, your position in\nthe house gradually changes; from being a guest, you become a friend, a\nbrother. For it is your duty to show, above all things, that you are not\nscemo–witless, soft-headed–the unforgivable sin in the south. You\nmay be a forger or cut-throat–why not? It is a vocation like any other,\na vocation for men. But whoever cannot take care of him-self–i.e. of\nhis money–is not to be trusted, in any walk of life; he is of no\naccount; he is no man. I have become firm friends with some of these\nproprietors by the simple expedient of striking a few francs off their\nbills; and should I ever wish to marry one or their daughters, the\nsurest way to predispose the whole family in my favour would be this\nmethod of amiable but unsmiling contestation.",
        "Of course the inns are often dirty, and not only in their sleeping\naccommodation. The reason is that, like Turks or Jews, their owners do\nnot see dirt (there is no word for dirt in the Hebrew language); they\nthink it odd when you draw their attention to it. I remember\ncomplaining, in one of my fastidious moments, of a napkin, plainly not\nmy own, which had been laid at my seat. There was literally not a clean\nspot left on its surface, and I insisted on a new one. I got it; but not\nbefore hearing the proprietor mutter something about “the caprices of\npregnant women.” . . .",
        "The view from these my new quarters at Rossano compensates for divers\nother little drawbacks. Down a many-folded gorge of glowing red earth\ndecked with olives and cistus the eye wanders to the Ionian Sea shining\nin deepest turquoise tints, and beautified by a glittering margin of\nwhite sand. To my left, the water takes a noble sweep inland; there lies\nthe plain of Sybaris, traversed by the Crathis of old that has thrust a\nlong spit of fand into the waves. On this side the outlook is bounded by\nthe high range of Pollino and Dolcedorme, serrated peaks that are even\nnow (midsummer) displaying a few patches of snow. Clear-cut in the\nmorning light, these exquisite mountains evaporate, towards sunset, in\nan amethystine haze. A restful prospect.",
        "But great was my amazement, on looking out of the window during the\nnight after my arrival, to observe the Polar star placed directly over\nthe Ionian Sea–the south, as I surely deemed it. A week has passed\nsince then, and in spite of the map I have not quite familiarized myself\nwith this spectacle, nor yet with that other one of the sun setting\napparently due east, over Monte Pollino.",
        "The glory of Rossano is the image of the Madonna Achiropita.\nBartholomaeus tells us, in his life of Saint Nilus, that in olden days\nshe was wont to appear, clothed in purple, and drive away with a divine\ntorch the Saracen invaders of this town. In more recent times, too, she\nhas often saved the citizens from locusts, cholera, and other calamitous\nvisitations. Unlike most of her kind, she was not painted by Saint Luke.\nShe is acheiropoeta–not painted by any human hands whatever, and in\nso far resembles a certain old image of the Magna Mater, her prototype,\nwhich was also of divine origin. It is generally supposed that this\npicture is painted on wood. Not so, says Diehl; it is a fragment of a\nfresco on stone.",
        "Hard by, in the clock-tower of the square, is a marble tablet erected to\nthe memory of the deputy Felice Cavalotti. We all remember Cavalotti,\nthe last–with Imbriani–of the republican giants, a blustering\nrhetorician-journalist, annihilator of monarchs and popes; a fire-eating\nduellist, who deserved his uncommon and unlovely fate. He provoked a\ncolleague to an encounter and, during a frenzied attack, received into\nhis open mouth the point of his adversary’s sword, which sealed up for\never that fountain of eloquence and vituperation.",
        "Cavalotti and the Virgin Achiropita–the new and the old. Really, with\nsuch extreme ideals before his eyes, the burghers of Rossano must\nsometimes wonder where righteousness lies.",
        "They call themselves Calabrians. Noi siamo calabresi! they proudly\nsay, meaning that they are above suspicion of unfair dealing. As a\nmatter of fact, they are a muddled brood, and considerably given to\ncheating when there is any prospect of success. You must watch the\npeasants coming home at night from their field-work if you wish to see\nthe true Calabrian type–whiskered, short and wiry, and of dark\ncomplexion. There is that indescribable mark of race in these\ncountrymen; they are different in features and character from the\nItalians; it is an ascetic, a Spanish type. Your Calabrian is strangely\nscornful of luxury and even comfort; a creature of few but well-chosen\nwords, straightforward, indifferent to pain and suffering, and dwelling\nby preference, when religiously minded, on the harsher aspects of his\nfaith. A note of unworldliness is discoverable in his outlook upon life.\nDealing with such men, one feels that they are well disposed not from\nimpulse, but from some dark sense of preordained obligation. Greek and\nother strains have infused versatility and a more smiling exterior; but\nthe groundwork of the whole remains that old homo ibericus of austere\ngentlemanliness.",
        "Rossano was built by the Romans, says Procopius, and during Byzantine\ndays became a fortress of primary importance. An older settlement\nprobably lay by the seashore, and its harbour is marked as “good” so\nlate as the days of Edrisius. Like many of these old Calabrian ports, it\nis now invaded by silt and sand, though a few ships still call there.\nWishful to learn something of the past glories of the town, I enquired\nat the municipality for the public library, but was informed by the\nsupercilious and not over-polite secretary that this proud city\npossesses no such institution. A certain priest, he added, would give me\nall the desired information.",
        "Canonico Rizzo was a delightful old man, with snowy hair and candid blue\neyes. Nothing, it seemed, could have given him greater pleasure than my\nappearance at that particular moment. He discoursed awhile, and sagely,\nconcerning England and English literature, and then we passed on, via\nMilton, to Calvin and the Puritan movement in Scotland; next, via\nLivingstone, to colonial enterprises in Africa; and finally, via\nEgypt, Abyssinia, and Prester John, to the early history of the eastern\nchurches. Byzantinism–Saint Nilus; that gave me the desired\nopportunity, and I mentioned the object of my visit.",
        "“The history of Rossano? Well, well! The secretary of the municipality\ndoes me too much honour. You must read the Book of Genesis and Hesiod\nand Berosus and the rest of them. But stay! I have something of more\nmodern date, in which you will find these ancient authors conveniently\nclassified.”",
        "From this book by de Rosis, printed in 1838, I gleaned two facts,\nfirstly, that the city of Rossano is now 3663 years old–quite a\nrespectable age, as towns go–and lastly, that in the year 1500 it had\nits own academy of lettered men, who called themselves “I spensierati,\"\nwith the motto Non alunt curai–an echo, no doubt, of the Neapolitan\nrenaissance under Alfonso the Magnificent. The popes Urban VIII and\nBenedict XIII belonged to this association of “thoughtless ones.” The\nwork ends with a formidable list of local personages distinguished in\nthe past for their gentleness of birth and polite accomplishments. One\nwonders how all these delicately nurtured creatures can have survived at\nRossano, if their sleeping accommodation-----",
        "You might live here some little time before realizing that this place,\nwhich seems to slope gently downhill against a pleasing background of\nwooded mountains, is capable of being strongly fortified. It lies, like\nother inland Calabrian (and Etruscan) cities, on ground enclosed by\nstream-beds, and one of these forms a deep gully above which Rossano\ntowers on a smooth and perpendicular precipice. The upper part of this\nwall of rock is grey sandstone; the lower a bed of red granitic matter.\nFrom this coloured stone, which crops up everywhere, the town may have\ndrawn its name of Rossano (rosso = red); not a very old settlement,\ntherefore; although certain patriotic philologers insist upon deriving\nit from “rus sanum,” healthy country. Its older names were Roscia, and\nRuscianum; it is not marked in Peutinger. Countless jackdaws and\nkestrels nestle in this cliff, as well as clouds of swifts, both Alpine\nand common. These swifts are the ornithological phenomenon of Rossano,\nand I think the citizens have cause to be thankful for their existence;\nto them I attribute the fact that there are so few flies, mosquitoes,\nand other aerial plagues here. If only the amiable birds could be\ninduced to extend their attentions to the bedrooms as well!",
        "This shady glen at the back of the city, with its sparse tufts of\nvegetation and monstrous blocks of deep red stone cloven into rifts and\nravines by the wild waters, has a charm of its own. There are undeniable\nsuggestions of Hell about the place. A pathway runs adown this vale of\nHinnom, and if you follow it upwards to the junction of the streams you\nwill reach a road that once more ascends to the town, past the old\nchurch of Saint Mark, a most interesting building. It has five little\ncupolas, but the interior, supported by eight columns, has been\nwhitewashed. The structure has now rightly been declared a “national\nmonument.” It dates from the ninth or tenth century and, according to\nBertaux, has the same plan and the same dimensions as the famous\n\"Cattolica” at Stilo, which the artistic Lear, though he stayed some\ntime at that picturesque place, does not so much as mention. They say\nthat this chapel of Saint Mark was built by Euprassius, protos-padarius\nof Calabria, and that in the days of Nilus it was dedicated to Saint\nAnastasius. Here, at Rossano, we are once more en plein Byzance.",
        "Rossano was not only a political bulwark, the most formidable citadel of\nthis Byzantine province. It was a great intellectual centre, upon which\nliterature, theology and art converged. Among the many perverse\nhistorical notions of which we are now ridding ourselves is this-that\nByzantinism in south Italy was a period of decay and torpid dreamings.\nIt needed, on the contrary, a resourceful activity to wipe out, as did\nthose colonists from the east, every trace of Roman culture and language\n(Latin rule only revived at Rossano in the fifteenth century). There was\nno lethargy in their social and political ambitions, in their military\nachievements, which held the land against overwhelming numbers of\nSaracens, Lombards and other intruders. And the life of those old monks\nof Saint Basil, as we now know it, represented a veritable renaissance\nof art and letters.",
        "Of the ten Basilean convents that grew up in the surroundings of Rossano\nthe most celebrated was that of S. M. del Patir. Together with the\nothers, it succeeded to a period of eremitism of solitary anchorites\nwhose dwellings honeycombed the warm slopes that confront the\nIonian....",
        "The lives of some of these Greco-Calabrian hermits are valuable\ndocuments. In the Vitae Sanctorum Siculorum of O. Caietanus (1057)\nthe student will find a Latin translation of the biography of one of\nthem, Saint Elia Junior. He died in 903. It was written by a\ncontemporary monk, who tells us that the holy man performed many\nmiracles, among them that of walking over a river dryshod. And the\nBollandists (Acta Sanctorum, 11th September) have reprinted the\nbiography of Saint Elia Spelaeotes-the cave-dweller, as composed in\nGreek by a disciple. It is yet more interesting. He lived in a “honesta\nspelunca” which he discovered in 864 by means of a flight of bats\nissuing therefrom; he suffered persecutions from a woman, exactly after\nthe fashion of Joseph and Potiphar’s wife; he grew to be 94 years old;\nthe Saracens vainly tried to burn his dead body, and the water in which\nthis corpse was subsequently washed was useful for curing another holy\nman’s toothache. Yet even these creatures were subject to gleams of\ncommon sense. “Virtues,” said this one, “are better than miracles.”",
        "How are we to account for these rock-hermits and their inelegant habits?\nHow explain this poisoning of the sources of manly self-respect?",
        "Thus, I think: that under the influence of their creed they reverted\nperforce to the more bestial traits of aboriginal humanity. They were\nthrust back in their development. They became solitaries, animalesque\nand shy–such as we may imagine our hairy progenitors to have been.\nHence their dirt and vermin, their horror of learning, their unkempt\nhair, their ferocious independence, their distrust of sunshine and\nordered social life, their foul dieting, their dread of malign spirits,\ntheir cave-dwelling propensities. All bestial characteristics!",
        "This atavistic movement, this retrogression towards primevalism, must\nhave possessed a certain charm, for it attracted vast multitudes; it was\nonly hemmed, at last, by a physical obstacle.",
        "The supply of caves ran out.",
        "Not till then were its votaries forced to congregate in those unhealthy\nclusters which afterwards grew to be monasteries. Where many of them\nwere gathered together under one roof there imposed itself a certain\nrudimentary discipline and subordination; yet they preserved as much as\nthey could of their savage traits, cave-like cells and hatred of\ncleanliness, terror of demons, matted beards.",
        "Gradually the social habits of mundane fellow-creatures insinuated\nthemselves into these hives of squalor and idleness. The inmates began\nto wash and to shave; they acquired property, they tilled the ground,\nthey learnt to read and write, and finally became connaisseurs of books\nand pictures and wine and women. They were pleased to forget that the\neunuch and the beggar are the true Christian or Buddhist. In other\nwords, the allurements of rational life grew too strong for their\nconvictions; they became reasonable beings in spite of their creed. This\nis how coenobitism grew out of eremitism not only in Calabria, but in\nevery part of the world which has been afflicted with these\neccentrics. Go to Mount Athos, if you wish to see specimens of all the\ndifferent stages conveniently arranged upon a small area. . . .",
        "This convent of Patir exercised a great local influence as early as the\ntenth century; then, towards the end of the eleventh, it was completely\nrebuilt without and reorganized within. The church underwent a thorough\nrestoration in 1672. But it was shattered, together with the rest of the\nedifice, by the earthquake of 1836 which, Madonna Achiropita\nnotwithstanding, levelled to the ground one-half of the fifteen thousand\nhouses then standing at Rossano.",
        "These monastic establishments, as a general rule, were occupied later on\nby the Benedictines, who ousted the Basileans and were supplanted, in\ntheir turn, by popular orders of later days like the Theatines. Those\nthat are conveniently situated have now been turned into post offices,\nmunicipalities, and other public buildings–such has been the common\nprocedure. But many of them, like this of Patir, are too decayed and\nremote from the life of man. Fiore, who wrote in 1691, counts up 94\ndilapidated Basilean monasteries in Calabria out of a former total of\nabout two hundred; Patir and thirteen others he mentions as having, in\nhis day, their old rites still subsisting. Batiffol has recently gone\ninto the subject with his usual thoroughness.",
        "Nothing is uglier than a modern ruin, and the place would assuredly not\nbe worth the three hours’ ride from Rossano were it not for the church,\nwhich has been repaired, and for the wondrous view to be obtained from\nits site. The journey, too, is charming, both by the ordinary track that\ndescends from Rossano and skirts the foot of the hills through olives\nand pebbly stream-beds, ascending, finally, across an odorous tangle of\ncistus, rosemary and myrtle to the platform on which the convent\nstands–or by the alternative and longer route which I took on the\nhomeward way, and which follows the old water conduit built by the monks\ninto a forest of enormous chestnuts, oaks, hollies and Calabrian pines,\nemerging out of an ocean of glittering bracken.",
        "I was pursued into the church of Patir by a bevy of country wenches who\nfrequented this region for purposes of haymaking. There is a miraculous\ncrucifix in this sanctuary, hidden behind a veil which, with infinite\nceremony, these females withdrew for my edification. There it was, sure\nenough; but what, I wondered, would happen from the presence of these\nimpure creatures in such a place? Things have changed considerably since\nthe days of old, for such was the contamination to be expected from the\nmere presence of a woman within these walls that even the Mother of God,\nwhile visiting Saint Nilus–the builder, not the great saint–at work\nupon the foundations, often conversed with him, but never ventured to\nstep within the area of the building itself. And later on it was a\nwell-authenticated phenomenon recorded by Beltrano and others, that if a\nfemale entered the church, the heavens immediately became cloudy and\nsent down thunders and lightnings and such-like signs of celestial\ndisapproval, which never ceased until the offending monster had left the\npremises.",
        "From this ancient monastery comes, I fancy, the Achiropita image.\nMontorio will tell you all about it; he learnt its history in June 1712\nfrom the local archbishop, who had extracted his information out of the\nepiscopal archives. Concerning another of these wonder-working\nidols–that of S. M. del Patirion–you may read in the ponderous tomes\nof Ughelli.",
        "Whether the celebrated Purple Codex of Rossano ever formed part of the\nlibrary of Patirion has not yet been determined. This wonderful\nparchment–now preserved at Rossano–is mentioned for the first time by\nCesare Malpica, who wrote some interesting things about the Albanian and\nGreek colonies in Calabria, but it was only discovered, in the right\nsense of that word, in March 1879 by Gebhardt and Harnack. They\nillustrated it in their Evangeliorum Codex Graecus. Haseloff also\ndescribed it in 1898 (Codex Purpureus Rossanensis), and pointed out\nthat its iconographical value consists in the fact that it is the only\nGreek Testament MS. containing pictures of the life of Christ before the\neighth-ninth century. These pictures are indeed marvellous–more\nmarvellous than beautiful, like so many Byzantine productions; their\nvalue is such that the parchment has now been declared a “national\nmonument.” It is sternly guarded, and if it is moved out of Rossano–as\nhappened lately when it was exhibited at Grottaferrata–it travels in\nthe company of armed carbineers.",
        "Still pursued by the flock of women, I took to examining the floor of\nthis church, which contains tesselated marble pavements depicting\ncentaurs, unicorns, lions, stags, and other beasts. But my contemplation\nof these choice relics was disturbed by irrelevant remarks on the part\nof the worldly females, who discovered in the head of the stag some\nsubtle peculiarity that stirred their sense of humour.",
        "“Look!” said one of them to her neighbour. “He has horns. Just like your\nPasquale.”",
        "“Pasquale indeed! And how about Antonio?”",
        "I enquired whether they knew what kind of animals these were.",
        "“Beasts of the ancients. Beasts that nobody knows. Beasts that have\nhorns–like certain Christians. . . .”",
        "From the terrace of green sward that fronts this ruined monastery you\ncan see the little town of Corigliano, whose coquettish white houses lie\nin a fold of the hills. Corigliano–[Greek: xorion   hellaion] (land of\nolives): the derivation, if not correct, is at least appropriate, for it\nlies embowered in a forest of these trees. A gay place it was, in\nBourbon times, with a ducal ruler of its own. Here, they say, the\nremnants of the Sybarites took refuge after the destruction of their\ncity whose desolate plain lies at our feet, backed by the noble range of\nDolcedorme. Swinburne, like a sensible man, takes the Sybarites under\nhis protection; he defends their artificially shaded streets and those\nother signs of voluptuousness which, to judge by certain modern\nresearches, seem to have been chiefly contrived for combating the demon\nof malaria. Earthly welfare, the cult of material health and ease–such\nwas their ideal.",
        "In sharpest contrast to these strivings stands the aim of those old\nmonks who scorned the body as a mere encumbrance, seeking spiritual\nenlightenment and things not of this earth.",
        "And now, Sybarites and Basileans–alike in ruins!",
        "A man of to-day, asked which of the two civilizations he would wish\nrestored, would not hesitate long in deciding for the Hellenic one.\nReaders of Lenormant will call to mind his glowing pages on the wonders\nthat might be found buried on the site of Sybaris. His plan of\nexcavation sounds feasible enough. But how remote it becomes, when one\nremembers the case of Herculaneum! Here, to our certain knowledge, many\nmiracles of antique art and literature lie within a few feet of our\nreach; yet nothing is done. These hidden monuments, which are the\nheritage of all humanity, are withheld from our eyes by the\ndog-in-the-manger policy of a country which, even without foreign\nassistance, could easily accomplish the work, were it to employ thereon\nonly half the sum now spent in feeding, clothing and supervising a horde\nof criminals, every one of whom ought to be hanged ten times over.\nMeanwhile other nations are forbidden to co-operate; the fair-minded\nGerman proposals were scornfully rejected; later on, those of Sir\nCharles Waldstein.",
        "“What!” says the Giornale d’ Italia, “are we to have international\nexcavation-committees thrust upon us? Are we to be treated like the Turks?”",
        "That, gentle sirs, is precisely the state of the case.",
        "The object of such committees is to do for the good of mankind what a\nsingle nation is powerless or unwilling to do. Your behaviour at\nHerculaneum is identical with that of the Turks at Nineveh. The system\nadopted should likewise be the same.",
        "I shall never see that consummation.",
        "But I shall not forget a certain article in an American paper–\"The New\nYork Times,” I fancy–which gave me fresh food for thought, here at\nPatirion, in the sight of that old Hellenic colony, and with the light\nchatter of those women still ringing in my ears. Its writer, with whom\nnot all of us will agree, declared that first in importance of all the\nantiquities buried in Italian soil come the lost poems of Sappho. The\nlost poems of Sappho–a singular choice! In corroboration whereof he\nquoted the extravagant praise of J. A. Symonds upon that amiable and\nambiguous young person. And he might have added Algernon Swinburne, who\ncalls her “the greatest poet who ever was at all.”",
        "Sappho and these two Victorians, I said to myself. . . . Why just these\ntwo? How keen is the cry of elective affinity athwart the ages! The\nsoul, says Plato, divines that which it seeks, and traces obscurely\nthe footsteps of its obscure desire.",
        "The footsteps of its obscure desire-----",
        "So one stumbles, inadvertently, upon problems of the day concerning\nwhich our sages profess to know nothing. And yet I do perceive a certain\nWriting upon the Wall setting forth, in clearest language, that 1 + 1 =\n3; a legend which it behoves them not to expunge, but to expound. For it\nrefuses to be expunged; and we do not need a German lady to tell us how\nmuch the “synthetic” sex, the hornless but not brainless sex, has done\nfor the life of the spirit while those other two were reclaiming the\nwaste places of earth, and procreating, and fighting–as befits their\nhorned anatomy.",
        "I remember asking my friend the Roman deputy of whom I have already\nspoken, and whom I regard as a fountain of wisdom on matters Italian,\nhow it came about that the railway stations in his country were apt to\nbe so far distant from the towns they serve. Rocca Bernarda, I was\nsaying, lies 33 kilometres from its station; and even some of the\nlargest towns in the kingdom are inconveniently and unnecessarily remote\nfrom the line.",
        "“True,” he replied. “Very true! Inconveniently . . . but perhaps not\nunnecessarily. . . .” He nodded his head, as he often does, when\nrevolving some deep problem in his mind.",
        "“Well, sir?”",
        "“Inasmuch as everything has its reasons, be they geographical,\nsociological, or otherwise . . .” and he mused again. “Let me tell you\nwhat I think as regards our respective English and Italian points of\nview,” he said at last. “And to begin with–a few generalities! We may\nhold that success in modern life consists in correctly appreciating the\nprinciples which underlie our experiences–in what may be called the\nscientific attitude towards things in general. Now, do the English\ncultivate this attitude? Not sufficiently. They are in the stage of\nthose mediaeval scholars who contentedly alleged separate primary causes\nfor each phenomenon, instead of seeking, by the investigation of\nsecondary ones, for the inevitable interdependence of the whole. In\nother words, they do not subordinate facts; they co-ordinate them. Your\npoliticians and all your public men are guided by impulse–by\nexpediency, as they prefer to call it; they are empirical; they never\nattempt to codify their conduct; they despise it as theorizing. What\nhappens? This old-fashioned hand-to-mouth system of theirs invariably\nbreaks down here and there. And then f Then they trust to some divine\ninterposition, some accident, to put things to rights again. The success\nof the English is largely built up on such accidents–on the mistakes of\nother people. Provi dence has favoured them so far, on the whole; but\none day it may leave them in the lurch, as it did the anti-scientific\nRussians in their war with the Japanese. One day other people will\nforget to make these pleasant mistakes.”",
        "He paused, and I forbore to interrupt his eloquence.",
        "“To come now to the practical application–to this particular instance.\nTell me, does your English system testify to any constructive\nforethought? In London, I am assured, the railway companies have built\nstations at enormous expense in the very heart of the town. What will be\nthe consequence of this hand-to-mouth policy? This, that in fifty years\nsuch structures will have become obsolete–stranded in slums at the back\nof new quarters yet undreamed of. New depots will have to be built.\nWhereas in Italy the now distant city will in fifty years have grown to\nreach its station and, in another half-century, will have encircled it.\nThanks to our sagacity, the station will then be in its proper place, in\nthe centre of the town. Our progeny will be grateful; and that again,\nyou will admit, is a worthy aim for our politicians. Besides, what would\nhappen to our coachmen if nobody needed their services on arriving at\nhis destination? The poor men must not be allowed to starve! Cold head\nand warm heart, you know; humanitarian considerations cannot be thrust\naside by a community that prides itself on being truly civilized. I\ntrust I have made myself intelligible?”",
        "“You always do. But why should I incommode myself to please your\nprogeny, or even my own? And I don’t like the kind of warm heart that\nsubordinates my concerns to those of a cab-driver. You don’t altogether\nconvince me, dear sir.”",
        "“To speak frankly, I sometimes don’t convince myself. My own country\nstation, for example, is curiously remote from the city, and it is\nannoying on wintry nights to drive through six miles of level mud when\nyou are anxious to reach home and dinner; so much so that, in my\negoistical moments, I would have been glad if our administration had\nadopted the more specious British method. But come now! You cannot raise\nthat objection against the terminus at Rome.”",
        "“Not that one. But I can raise two others. The platforms are\ninconveniently arranged, and a traveller will often find it impossible\nto wash his hands and face there; as to hot water-----”",
        "“Granting a certain deplorable disposition of the lines–why on earth,\npray, should a man cleanse himself at the station when there are\ncountless hotels and lodging-houses in the city? O you English originals!”",
        "“And supposing,” I urged, “he is in a hurry to catch another train going\nsouth, to Naples or Palermo?”",
        "“There I have you, my illustrious friend! Nobody travels south of Rome.”",
        "Nobody travels south of Rome. . . .",
        "Often have I thought upon those words.",
        "This conversation was forcibly recalled to my mind by the fact that it\ntook our creaky old diligence two and a half hours (one of the horses\nhad been bought the day before, for six pounds) to drive from the\nstation of Castrovillari to the entrance of the town, where we were\ndelayed another twenty minutes, while the octroi zealots searched\nthrough every bag and parcel on the post-waggon.",
        "Many people have said bad things about this place. But my once\nunpleasant impressions of it have been effaced by my reception at its\nnew and decent little hostelry. What a change after the sordid filth of\nRossano! Castrovillari, to be sure, has no background of hoary eld to\natone for such deficiencies. It was only built the other day, by the\nNormans; or by the Romans, who called it Aprustum; or possibly by the\nGreeks, who founded their Abystron on this particular site for the same\nreasons that commended it in yet earlier times to certain bronze and\nstone age primitives, whose weapons you may study in the British Museum\nand elsewhere. [Footnote: Even so Taranto, Cumae, Paestum, Metapontum,\nMonteleone and other southern towns were founded by the ancients on the\nsite of prehistoric stations.]",
        "But what are the stone ages compared with immortal and immutable\nRossano? An ecclesiastical writer has proved that Calabria was inhabited\nbefore the Noachian flood; and Rossano, we may be sure, was one of the\nfavourite haunts of the antediluvians. None the less, it is good to rest\nin a clean bed, for a change; and to feed off a clean plate.",
        "We are in the south. One sees it in sundry small ways–in the behaviour\nof the cats, for instance. . . .",
        "The Tarentines, they say, imported the cat into Europe. If those of\nsouth Italy still resemble their old Nubian ancestors, the beast would\nassuredly not have been worth the trouble of acclimatizing. On entering\nthese regions, one of the first things that strikes me is the difference\nbetween the appearance of cats and dogs hereabouts, and in England or\nany northern country; and the difference in their temperaments. Our dogs\nare alert in their movements and of wideawake features; here they are\narowsy and degraded mongrels, with expressionless eyes. Our cats are\nsleek and slumberous; here they prowl about haggard, shifty and\ncareworn, their fur in patches and their ears a-tremble from nervous\nanxiety. That domestic animals such as these should be fed at home does\nnot commend itself to the common people; they must forage for their food\nabroad. Dogs eat offal, while the others hunt for lizards in the fields.\nA lizard diet is supposed to reduce their weight (it would certainly\nreduce mine); but I suspect that southern cats are emaciated not only\nfrom this cause, but from systematic starvation. Many a kitten is born\nthat never tastes a drop of cow’s milk from the cradle to the grave, and\nlittle enough of its own mother’s.",
        "To say that our English zoophilomania–our cult of lap-dogs–smacks of\ndegeneracy does not mean that I sympathize with the ill-treatment of\nbeasts which annoys many visitors to these parts and has been attributed\nto “Saracenic” influences. Wrongly, of course; one might as well\nattribute it to the old Greeks. [Footnote: Whose attitude towards\nanimals, by the way, was as far removed from callousness as from\nsentimentalism. We know how those Hellenic oxen fared who had laboured\nto draw up heavy blocks for the building of a temple–how, on the\ncompletion of their task, they were led into green fields, there to\npasture unmolested for the rest of their lives. We know that the Greeks\nwere appreciative of the graces and virtues of canine nature–is not the\nHomeric Argo still the finest dog-type in literature? Yet to them the\ndog, even he of the tender Anthology, remained what he is: a tamed\nbeast. The Greeks, sitting at dinner, resented the insolence of a\ncreature that, watching every morsel as it disappeared into the mouth of\nits master, plainly discovered by its physiognomy the desire, the\npresumed right, to devour what he considered fit only for himself.\nWhence that profound word [Greek: kunopes]–dog-eyed, shameless. In\ncontrast to this sanity, observe what an Englishman can read into a\ndog’s eye:",
        "[That is how Matthew Arnold interprets the feelings of Fido, watching his\nmaster at work upon a tender beefsteak. . . .]",
        "Poor Saracens! They are a sort of whipping-boy, all over the country.\nThe chief sinner in this respect is the Vatican, which has authorized\ncruelty to animals by its official teaching. When Lord Odo-Russell\nenquired of the Pope regarding the foundation of a society for the\nprevention of cruelty to animals in Italy, the papal answer was: “Such\nan association could not be sanctioned by the Holy See, being founded\non a theological error, to wit, that Christians owed any duties to\nanimals.” This language has the inestimable and rather unusual merit of\nbeing perspicuous. Nevertheless, Ouida’s flaming letters to “The Times\"\ninaugurated an era of truer humanity. . . .",
        "And the lateness of the dining-hour–another symptom of the south. It\nwas eleven o’clock when I sat down to dinner on the night of my arrival,\nand habitues of the hotel, engineers and so forth, were still dropping\nin for their evening meal. Appetite comes more slowly than ever, now\nthat the heats have begun.",
        "They have begun in earnest. The swoon of summer is upon the land, the\ngrass is cut, cicadas are chirping overhead. Despite its height of a\nthousand feet, Castrovillari must be blazing in August, surrounded as it\nis by parched fields and an amphitheatre of bare limestone hills that\nexhale the sunny beams. You may stroll about these fields observing the\nconstruction of the line which is to pass through Cassano, a pretty\nplace, famous for its wine and mineral springs; or studying the habits\nof the gigantic grasshoppers that hang in clusters to the dried thistles\nand start off, when scared, with the noise of a covey of partridges; or\nwatching how the cows are shod, at this season, to thresh the corn. Old\nauthors are unanimous in declaring that the town was embowered in oak\nforests; as late as 1844 it was lamented that this “ancient barbarous\ncustom” of cutting them down had not yet been discontinued. The\nmischief is now done, and it would be interesting to know the difference\nbetween the present summer temperature and that of olden days.",
        "The manna ash used to be cultivated in these parts. I cannot tell\nwhether its purgative secretion is still in favour. The confusion\nbetween this stuff and the biblical manna gave rise to the legends about\nCalabria where “manna droppeth as dew from Heaven.” Sandys says it was\nprepared out of the mulberry. He copied assiduously, did old Sandys, and\nyet found room for some original blunders of his own. R. Pococke, by the\nway, is one of those who were dissatisfied with Castrovillari. He found\nno accommodation save an empty house. “A poor town.” . . .",
        "Driving through modern Castrovillari one might think the place flat and\nundeserving of the name of castrum. But the old town is otherwise. It\noccupies a proud eminence–the head of a promontory which overlooks the\njunction of two streams; the newer settlement stands on the more level\nground at its back. This acropolis, once thronged with folk but now\nwell-nigh deserted, has all the macabre fascination of decay. A mildewy\nspirit haunts those tortuous and uneven roadways; plaster drops unheeded\nfrom the walls; the wild fig thrusts luxuriant arms through the windows\nof palaces whose balconies are rusted and painted loggias crumbling to\nearth ... a mournful and malarious agglomeration of ruins.",
        "There is a castle, of course. It was built, or rebuilt, by the\nAragonese, with four corner towers, one of which became infamous for a\nscene that rivals the horrors of the Black Hole of Calcutta. Numbers of\nconfined brigands, uncared-for, perished miserably of starvation within\nits walls. Says the historian Botta:",
        "“The abominable taint prevented the guards from approaching; the dead\nbodies were not carried away. The pestilence increased; in pain and\nexhaustion, the dying fell shuddering on the dead; the hale on the\ndying; all tearing themselves like dogs with teeth and nails. The tower\nof Castrovillari became a foul hole of corruption, and the stench was\nspread abroad for a long season.”",
        "This castle is now used as a place of confinement. Sentries warned me at\none point not to approach too near the walls; it was “forbidden.” I had\nno particular desire to disobey this injunction. Judging by the number\nof rats that swarm about the place, it is not exactly a model prison.",
        "One of the streets in this dilapidated stronghold bears to this day the\ninscription “Giudea,” or Jewry. Southern Italy was well stocked with\nthose Hebrews concerning whom Mr. H. M. Adler has sagely discoursed.\nThey lived in separate districts, and seem to have borne a good\nreputation. Those of Castrovillari, on being ejected by Ferdinand the\nCatholic in 1511, obligingly made a donation of their school to the\ntown. But they returned anon, and claimed it again. Persecuted as they\nwere, they never suffered the martyrdom of the ill-starred Waldensian\ncolonies in Calabria.",
        "The houses of this Jewry overlook the Coscile river, the Sybaris of old,\nand from a spot in the quarter a steep path descends to its banks. Here\nyou will find yourself in another climate, cool and moist. The livid\nwaters tumble gleefully towards the plain, amid penurious plots of beans\nand tomatoes, and a fierce tangle of vegetation wherever the hand of man\nhas not made clearings. Then, mounting aloft once more, you will do well\nto visit the far-famed chapel that sits at the apex of the promontory,\nSanta Maria del Castello. There is a little platform where you may\nrepose and enjoy the view, as I have done for some evenings\npast–letting the eye roam up-country towards Dolcedorme and its sister\npeaks, and westwards over the undulating Sila lands whose highest point,\nBotte Donato, is unmistakable even at this distance of forty miles, from\nits peculiar shape.",
        "The Madonna picture preserved within the sanctuary has performed so many\nmiracles in ages past that I despair of giving any account of them. It\nis high time, none the less, for a new sign from Heaven. Shattered by\nearthquakes, the chapel is in a dis-ruptured and even menacing\ncondition. Will some returned emigrant from America come forward with\nthe necessary funds?",
        "That would be a miracle, too, in its way. But gone, for the present, are\nthe ages of Faith–the days when the peevishly-protestant J. H. Bartels\nsojourned here and groaned as he counted up the seven monasteries of\nCastrovillari (there used to be nearly twice that number), and viewed\nthe 130 priests, “fat-paunched rascals, loafing about the streets and\ndoorways.” . . .",
        "From my window in the hotel I espy a small patch of snow on the hills. I\nknow the place; it is the so-called “Montagna del Principe” past which\nthe track winds into the Pollino regions. Thither I am bound; but so\ncomplicated is life that even for a short three days’ ramble among those\nforests a certain amount of food and clothing must be provided–a mule\nis plainly required. There seem to be none of these beasts available at\nCastrovillari.",
        "“To Morano!” they tell me. “It is nearer the mountain, and there you\nwill find mules plentiful as blackberries. To Morano!”",
        "Morano lies a few miles higher up the valley on the great military road\nto Lagonegro, which was built by Murat and cuts through the interior of\nBasilicata, rising at Campo Tenese to a height of noo metres. They are\nnow running a public motor service along this beautiful stretch of 52\nkilometres, at the cheap rate of a sou per kilometre.",
        "En route!",
        "Once you have reached the latitude of Naples, the word grazie (thank\nyou) vanishes from the vocabulary of all save the most cultured. But to\nconclude therefrom that one is among a thankless race is not altogether\nthe right inference. They have a wholly different conception of the\naffair. Our septentrional “thanks” is a complicated product in which\ngratefulness for things received and for things to come are\nunconsciously balanced; while their point of view differs in nothing\nfrom that of the beau-ideal of Greek courtesy, of Achilles, whose mother\nprocured for him a suit of divine armour from Hephaistos, which he\nreceived without a word of acknowledgment either for her or for the god\nwho had been put to some little trouble in the matter. A thing given\nthey regard as a thing found, a hermaion, a happy hit in the lottery of\nlife; the giver is the blind instrument of Fortune. This chill attitude\nrepels us; and our effusive expressions of thankfulness astonish these\npeople and the Orientals.",
        "A further difference is that the actual gift is viewed quite\nextrinsically, intellectually, either in regard to what it would fetch\nif bartered or sold, or, if to be kept, as to how far its possession may\nraise the recipient in the eyes of other men. This is purely Homeric,\nonce more–Homeric or primordial, if you prefer. Odysseus told his kind\nhost Alkinoos, whom he was never to see again, that he would be glad to\nreceive farewell presents from him–to cherish as a friendly memory?\nNo, but “because they would make him look a finer fellow when he got\nhome.” The idea of a keepsake, of an emotional value attaching to some\ntrifle, is a northern one. Here life is give and take, and lucky he who\ntakes more than he gives; it is what Professor Mahaffy calls the\n\"ingrained selfishness of the Greek character.” Speaking of all below\nthe upper classes, I should say that disinterested benevolence is apt to\nsurpass their comprehension, a good-natured person being regarded as\nweak in the head.",

They will\ndo acts of spontaneous kindness towards their family, far oftener than\nis customary with us. But outside that narrow sphere, interesse\n(Odyssean self-advantage) is the mainspring of their actions. Whence\ntheir smooth and glozing manners towards the stranger, and those\nprotestations of undying affection which beguile the unwary–they wish\nto be forever in your good graces, for sooner or later you may be of\nuse; and if perchance you do content them, they will marvel\n(philosophically) at your grotesque generosity, your lack of\ndiscrimination and restraint. Such malizia (cleverness) is none the\nmore respectable for being childishly transparent. The profound and\nunscrupulous northerner quickly familiarizes himself with its technique,\nand turns it to his own profit. Lowering his moral notions, he soon–so\none of them expressed it to me–\"walks round them without getting off\nhis chair” and, on the strength of his undeserved reputation for\nsimplicity and fair dealing, keeps them dangling a lifetime in a tremble\nof obsequious amiability, cheered on by the hope of ultimately\nover-reaching him. Idle dream, where a pliant and sanguine southerner is\npitted against the unswerving Saxon or Teuton! This accounts for the\nsuccess of foreign trading houses in the south. Business is business,\nand the devil take the hindmost! By all means; but they who are not\nrooted to the spot by commercial exigencies nor ready to adopt debased\nstandards of conduct will find that a prolonged residence in a centre\nlike Naples–the daily attrition of its ape-and-tiger elements–sullies\ntheir homely candour and self-respect.",

So much\nferocity tinctures civic life, that had they not dwelt in towns while we\nwere still shivering in bogs, one would deem them not yet ripe for\nherding together in large numbers; one would say that post-patriarchal\nconditions evoked the worst qualities of the race.

Then he was induced to try the maccheroni, because they were\n\"particularly good that morning\"; he ate, or rather drank, an immense\nplateful. After that came some slices of meat and a dish of green stuff\nsufficient to satisfy a starving bullock. A little fish? asked the\nwaiter. Well, perhaps yes, just for form’s sake–two fried mullets and\nsome nondescript fragments. Next, he devoured a couple of raw eggs “on\naccount of his miserably weak stomach,” a bowl of salad and a goodly\nlump of fresh cheese. Not without a secret feeling of envy I left him at\nwork upon his dessert, of which he had already consumed some six\npeaches.

Their less fortunate fellow-Semites, the Arabs, have\ncontinued to starve and to swear by the Koran–empty in body and empty\nin mind. No poise or balance is possible to those who live in uneasy\nconditions. The wisest of them can only attain to stoicism–a dumb\nprotest against the environment.

        "This Morano is a very ancient city; Tufarelli, writing in 1598, proves\nthat it was then exactly 3349 years old. Oddly enough, therefore, its\nfoundation almost coincides with that of Rossano. . . .",
        "There may be mules at Morano; indeed, there are. But they are illusive\nbeasts: phantom-mules. Despite the assistance of the captain of the\ncarbineers, the local innkeeper, the communal policeman, the secretary\nof the municipality, an amiable canon of the church and several\nnon-official residents, I vainly endeavoured, for three days, to procure\none–flitting about, meanwhile, between this place and Castrovillari.\nFor Morano, notwithstanding its size (they say it is larger than the\nother town) offers no accommodation or food in the septentrional sense\nof those terms.",
        "Its situation, as you approach from Castrovillari, is striking. The\nwhite houses stream in a cataract down one side of a steep conical hill\nthat dominates the landscape–on the summit sits the inevitable castle,\nblue sky peering through its battered windows. But the interior is not\nat all in keeping with this imposing aspect. Morano, so far as I was\nable to explore it, is a labyrinth of sombre, tortuous and fetid alleys,\nwhexe black pigs wallow amid heaps ’of miscellaneous and malodorous\nfilth–in short, the town exemplifies that particular idea of civic\nliberty which consists in everybody being free to throw their own\nprivate refuse into the public street and leave it there, from\ngeneration to generation. What says Lombroso? “The street-cleaning is\nentrusted, in many towns, to the rains of heaven and, in their absence,\nto the voracity of the pigs.” None the less, while waiting for mules\nthat never came, I took to patrolling those alleys, at first out of\nsheer boredom, but soon impelled by that subtle fascination which\nemanates from the ne plus ultra of anything–even of grotesque\ndirtiness. On the second day, however, a case of cholera was announced,\nwhich chilled my ardour for further investigations. It was on that\naccount that I failed to inspect what was afterwards described to me as\nthe chief marvel of the place–a carved wooden altar-piece in a certain\nchurch.",
        "“It is prodigious and antichissimo,” said an obliging citizen to\nwhom I applied for information. “There is nothing like it on earth, and\nI have been six times to America, sir. The artist–a real artist, mind\nyou, not a common professor–spent his whole life in carving it. It was\nfor the church, you see, and he wanted to show what he could do in the\nway of a masterpiece. Then, when it was finished and in its place, the\npriests refused to pay for it. It was made not for them, they said, but\nfor the glory of God; the man’s reward was sufficient. And besides, he\ncould have remission of sins for the rest of his life. He said he did\nnot care about remission of sins; he wanted money–money! But he got\nnothing. Whereupon he began to brood and to grow yellow. Money–money!\nThat was all he ever said. And at last he became quite green and died.\nAfter that, his son took up the quarrel, but he got as little out of the\npriests as the father. It was fixed in the church, you understand, and\nhe could not take it away. He climbed through the window one night and\ntried to burn it–the marks are there to this day–but they were too\nsharp for him. And he took the business so much to heart that he also\nsoon died quite young! And quite green–like his father.”",
        "The most characteristic item in the above history is that about growing\ngreen. People are apt to put on this colour in the south from\ndisappointment or from envy.

Therefore, if relief is thwarted,\nthey either brood themselves into a green melancholy, or succumb to a\nsudden “colpo di sangue,” like a young woman of my acquaintance who,\nconsidering herself beaten in a dispute with a tram-conductor about a\npenny, forthwith had a “colpo di sangue,” and was dead in a few hours.

The tackle consisted of a rod\nwith a bent piece of wire fixed to one end, and it seemed to me a pretty\nunpromising form of sport. But suddenly, amid wild vociferations, they\nhooked one, and carried it off in triumph to supper. The mother bird,\nmeanwhile, sailed restlessly about the aether watching every movement,\nas I could see by my glasses; at times she drifted quite near, then\nswerved again and hovered, with vibrating pinions, directly overhead. It\nwas clear that she could not tear herself away from the scene, and\nhardly had the marauders departed, when she alighted on the wall and\nbegan to inspect what was left of her dwelling. It was probably rather\nuntidy. I felt sorry for her; yet such harebrained imprudence cannot go\nunpunished. With so many hundred crannies in this old castle, why choose\none which any boy can reach with a stick? She will know better next season.",
        "Then an old shepherd scrambled up, and sat on the stone beside me. He\nwas short-sighted, asthmatic, and unable to work; the doctor had\nrecommended an evening walk up to the castle. We conversed awhile, and\nhe extracted a carnation out of his waistcoat pocket–unusual receptacle\nfor flowers–which he presented to me. I touched upon the all-absorbing\ntopic of mules.",
        "“Mules are very busy animals in Morano,” he explained. “Animali\noccupatissimi.” However, he promised to exert himself on my behalf; he\nknew a man with a mule–two mules–he would send him round, if possible.",
        "Quite a feature in the landscape of Morano is the costume of the women,\nwith their home-dyed red skirts and ribbons of the same hue plaited into\ntheir hair. It is a beautiful and reposeful shade of red, between\nPompeian and brick-colour, and the tint very closely resembles that of\nthe cloth worn by the beduin (married) women of Tunisia. Maybe it was\nintroduced by the Saracens. And it is they, I imagine, who imported that\nlove of red peppers (a favourite dish with most Orientals) which is\npeculiar to these parts, where they eat them voraciously in every form,\nparticularly in that of red sausages seasoned with these fiery condiments.",
        "The whole country is full of Saracen memories. The name of Morano, they\nsay, is derived from moro, [Footnote: This is all wrong, of course.\nAnd equally wrong is the derivation from moral, a mulberry–abundant\nas these trees are. And more wrong still, if possible, is that which is\ndrawn from a saying of the mysterious Oenotrians–that useful\ntribe–who, wandering in search of homesteads across these regions and\nobserving their beauty, are supposed to have remarked: Hic moremur–\nhere let us stay! Morano (strange to say) is simply the Roman Muranum.]\na Moor; and in its little piazza–an irregular and picturesque spot,\nshaded by a few grand old elms amid the sound of running waters–there\nis a sculptured head of a Moor inserted into the wall, commemorative, I\nwas told, of some ancient anti-Saracen exploit. It is the escutcheon of\nthe town. This Moor wears a red fez, and his features are painted black\n(this is de rigueur, for “Saracens “); he bears the legend Vivit\nsub arbore morus. Near at hand, too, lies the prosperous village\nSaracena, celebrated of old for its muscatel wines. They are made from\nthe grape which the Saracens brought over from Maskat, and planted all\nover Sicily. [Footnote: See next chapter.]",
        "The men of Morano emigrate to America; two-thirds of the adult and\nadolescent male population are at this moment on the other side of the\nAtlantic. But the oldsters, with their peaked hats (capello pizzuto)\nshading gnarled and canny features, are well worth studying. At this\nsummer season they leave the town at 3.30 a.m. to cultivate their\nfields, often far distant, returning at nightfall; and to observe these\nreally wonderful types, which will soon be extinct, you must take up a\nstand on the Castrovillari road towards sunset and watch them riding\nhome on their donkeys, or walking, after the labours of the day.",
        "Poorly dressed, these peasants are none the less wealthy; the post\noffice deposit of Morano is said to have two million francs to its\ncredit, mostly the savings of these humble cultivators, who can discover\nan astonishing amount of money when it is a question, for example, of\nproviding their daughters with a dowry. The bridal dress alone, a blaze\nof blue silk and lace and gold embroidery, costs between six hundred and\na thousand francs. Altogether, Morano is a rich place, despite its\nsordid appearance; it is also celebrated as the birthplace of various\nlearned men. The author of the “Calascione Scordato,” a famous\nNeapolitan poem of the seventeenth century, certainly lived here for\nsome time and has been acclaimed as a son of Morano, though he\ndistinctly speaks of Naples as his home. Among its elder literary\nglories is that Leonardo Tufarelli, who thus apostrophizes his birthplace:",
        "“And to proceed–how many letterati and virtuosi have issued from\nyou in divers times? Among whom–not to name all of them–there has been\nin our days Leopardo de l’Osso of happy memory, physician and most\nexcellent philosopher, singular in every science, of whom I dare say\nthat he attained to Pythagorean heights. How many are there to-day,\nversed in every faculty, in theology, in the two laws, and in medicine?\nHow many historians, how many poets, grammarians, artists, actors?”",
        "The modern writer Nicola Leoni is likewise a child of Morano; his\nvoluminous “Della Magna Grecia e delle Tre Calabrie” appeared in\n1844-1846. He, too, devotes much space to the praises of his natal city,\nand to lamentations regarding the sad condition of Calabrian letters\nduring those dark years.",
        "“Closed for ever is the academy of Amantea! Closed for ever is\nthe academy of Rossano! Rare are the lectures in the academy of\nMonteleone! Rare indeed the lectures in the academy of Catan-zaro!\nClosed for ever is the public library of Monteleone! O ancient days! O\nwisdom of our fathers! Where shall I find you?. . .”",
        "To live the intellectual life amid the ferociously squalid surroundings\nof Morano argues an enviable philosophic calm–a detachment bordering on\ninsensibility. But perhaps we are too easily influenced by externals, in\nthese degenerate times. Or things may have been better in days of\nold–who can tell? One always likes to think so, though the evidence\nusually points to the contrary.",
        "When least I expected it, a possessor of mules presented himself. He was\na burly ruffian of northern extraction, with clear eyes, fair moustache,\nand an insidious air of cheerfulness.",
        "Yes, he had a mule, he said; but as to climbing the mountain for three\nor four days on end–ha, ha!–that was rather an undertaking, you know.\nWas I aware that there were forests and snow up there? Had I ever been\nup the mountain? Indeed! Well, then I must know that there was no food-----",
        "I pointed to my store of provisions from Castrovillari. His eye wandered\nlovingly over the pile and reposed, finally, upon sundry odd bottles and\na capacious demijohn, holding twelve litres.",
        "“Wine of family,” I urged. “None of your eating-house stuff.”",
        "He thought he could manage it, after all. Yes; the trip could be\nundertaken, with a little sacrifice. And he had a second mule, a\nlady-mule, which it struck him I might like to ride now and then; a\npleasant beast and a companion, so to speak, for the other one. Two\nmules and two Christians–that seemed appropriate. . . . And only four\nfrancs a day more.",
        "Done! It was really cheap. So cheap, that I straightway grew suspicious\nof the “lady-mule.”",
        "We sealed the bargain in a glass of the local mixture, and I thereupon\ndemanded a caparra– a monetary security that he would keep his word,\ni.e. be round at my door with the animals at two in the morning, so as\nto reach the uplands before the heat became oppressive.",
        "His face clouded–a good omen, indicating that he was beginning to\nrespect me. Then he pulled out his purse, and reluctantly laid two\nfrancs on the table.",
        "The evening was spent in final preparations; I retired early to bed, and\ntried to sleep. One o’clock came, and two o’clock, and three o’clock–no\nmules! At four I went to the man’s house, and woke him out of ambrosial\nslumbers.",
        "“You come to see me so early in the morning?” he enquired, sitting up in\nbed and rubbing his eyes. “Now that’s really nice of you.”",
        "One of the mules, he airily explained, had lost a shoe in the afternoon.\nHe would get it put right at once–at once.",
        "“You might have told me so yesterday evening, instead of keeping me\nawake all night waiting for you.”",
        "“True,” he replied. “I thought of it at the time. But then I went to\nbed, and slept. Ah, sir, it is good to sleep!” and he stretched himself\nvoluptuously.",
        "The beast was shod, and at 5 a.m. we left.",
        "There is a type of physiognomy here which is undeniably Semitic–with\ncurly hair, dusky skin and hooked nose. We may take it to be of\nSaracenic origin, since a Phoenician descent is out of the question,\nwhile mediaeval Jews never intermarried with Christians. It is the same\nclass of face which one sees so abundantly at Palermo, the former\nmetropolis of these Africans. The accompanying likeness is that of a\nnative of Cosenza, a town that was frequently in their possession.\nEastern traits of character, too, have lingered among the populace. So\nthe humour of the peddling Semite who will allow himself to be called by\nthe most offensive epithets rather than lose a chance of gaining a sou;\nwho, eternally professing poverty, cannot bear to be twitted on his\nnotorious riches; their ceaseless talk of hidden treasures, their\nsecretiveness and so many other little Orientalisms that whoever has\nlived in the East will be inclined to echo the observation of Edward\nLear’s Greek servant: “These men are Arabs, but they have more clothes on.”",
        "Many Saracenic words (chiefly of marine and commercial import) have\nsurvived from this period; I could quote a hundred or more, partly in\nthe literary language (balio, dogana, etc.), partly in dialect (cala,\ntavuto, etc.) and in place-names such as Tamborio (the Semitic Mount\nTabor), Kalat (Calatafimi), Marsa (Marsala).",
        "Dramatic plays with Saracen subjects are still popular with the lower\nclasses; you can see them acted in any of the coast towns. In fact, the\nrecollection of these intruders is very much alive to this day. They\nhave left a deep scar.",
        "Such being the case, it is odd to find local writers hardly referring to\nthe Saracenic period. Even a modern like l’Occaso, who describes the\nCastrovillari region in a conscientious fashion, leaps directly from\nGreco-Roman events into those of the Normans. But this is in accordance\nwith the time-honoured ideal of writing such works: to say nothing in\ndispraise of your subject (an exception may be made in favour of\nSpano-Bolani’s History of Reggio). Malaria and earthquakes and Saracen\nirruptions are awkward arguments when treating of the natural\nattractions and historical glories of your native place. So the once\nrenowned descriptions of this province by Grano and the rest of them are\nlittle more than rhetorical exercises; they are “Laus Calabria.” And\nthen–their sources of information were limited and difficult of access.\nCollective works like those of Muratori and du Chesne had not appeared\non the market; libraries were restricted to convents; and it was not to\nbe expected that they should know all the chroniclers of the Byzantines,\nLatins, Lombards, Normans and Hohenstaufen–to say nothing of Arab\nwriters like Nowairi, Abulfeda, Ibn Chaldun and Ibn Alathir–who throw a\nlittle light on those dark times, and are now easily accessible to\nscholars.",
        "Dipping into this old-world literature of murders and prayers, we gather\nthat in pre-Saracenic times the southern towns were denuded of their\ngarrisons, and their fortresses fallen into disrepair. “Nec erat formido\naut metus bellorum, quoniam alta pace omnes gaudebant usque ad tempora\nSaracenorum.” In this part of Italy, as well as at Taranto and other\nparts of old “Calabria,” the invaders had an easy task before them, at\nfirst.",
        "In 873, on their return from Salerno, they poured into Calabria, and by\n884 already held several towns, such as Tropea and Amantea, but were\ndriven out temporarily. In 899 they ravaged, says Hepi-danus, the\ncountry of the Lombards (? Calabria). In 900 they destroyed Reggio, and\nrenewed their incursions in 919, 923, 924, 925, 927, till the Greek\nEmperor found it profitable to pay them an annual tribute. In 953, this\ntribute not being forthcoming, they defeated the Greeks in Calabria, and\nmade further raids in 974, 975; 976, 977, carrying off a large store of\ncaptives and wealth. In 981 Otto II repulsed them at Cotrone, but was\nbeaten the following year near Squillace, and narrowly escaped capture.\nIt was one of the most romantic incidents of these wars. During the\nyears 986, 988, 991, 994, 998, 1002, 1003 they were continually in the\ncountry; indeed, nearly every year at the beginning of the eleventh\ncentury is marked by some fresh inroad. In 1009 they took Cosenza for\nthe third or fourth time; in 1020 they were at Bisignano in the Crati\nvalley, and returned frequently into those parts, defeating, in 1025, a\nGreek army under Orestes, and, in 1031, the assembled forces of the\nByzantine Catapan-------- [Footnote: I have not seen Moscato’s “Cronaca\ndei Musulmani in Calabria,” where these authorities might be\nconveniently tabulated. It must be a rare book. Martorana deals only\nwith the Saracens of Sicily.]",
        "No bad record, from their point of view.",
        "But they never attained their end, the subjection of the mainland. And\ntheir methods involved appalling and enduring evils.",
        "Yet the presumable intent or ambition of these aliens must be called\nreasonable enough. They wished to establish a provincial government here\non the same lines as in Sicily, of which island it has been said that it\nwas never more prosperous than under their administration.",
        "Literature, trade, industry, and all the arts of peace are described as\nflourishing there; in agriculture they paid especial attention to the\nolive; they initiated, I believe, the art of terracing and irrigating\nthe hill-sides; they imported the date-palm, the lemon and sugar-cane\n(making the latter suffice not only for home consumption, but for\nexport); their silk manufactures were unsurpassed. Older writers like\nMazzella speak of the abundant growth of sugar-cane in Calabria\n(Capialbi, who wallowed in learning, has a treatise on the subject);\nJohn Evelyn saw it cultivated near Naples; it is now extinct from\neconomical and possibly climatic causes. They also introduced the\npapyrus into Sicily, as well as the cotton-plant, which used to be\ncommon all over south Italy, where I have myself seen it growing.",
        "All this sounds praiseworthy, no doubt. But I see no reason why they\nshould have governed Sicily better than they did North Africa, which\ncrumbled into dust at their touch, and will take many long centuries to\nrecover its pre-Saracen prosperity. There is something flame-like and\nanti-constructive in the Arab, with his pastoral habits and contempt of\nforethought. In favour of their rule, much capital has been made out of\nBenjamin of Tudela’s account of Palermo. But it must not be forgotten\nthat his brief visit was made a hundred years after the Norman\noccupation had begun. Palermo, he says, has about 1500 Jews and a large\nnumber of Christians and Mohammedans; Sicily “contains all the pleasant\nthings of this world.” Well, so it did in pre-Saracen times; so it does\nto-day. Against the example of North Africa, no doubt, may be set their\nactivities in Spain.",
        "They have been accused of destroying the old temples of Magna Gracia\nfrom religious or other motives. I do not believe it; this was against\ntheir usual practice. They sacked monasteries, because these were\nfortresses defended by political enemies and full of gold which they\ncoveted; but in their African possessions, during all this period, the\nruins of ancient civilizations were left untouched, while Byzantine\ncults lingered peacefully side by side with Mos-lemism; why not here?\nTheir fanaticism has been much exaggerated. Weighing the balance between\nconflicting writers, it would appear that Christian rites were tolerated\nin Sicily during all their rule, though some governors were more bigoted\nthan others; the proof is this, that the Normans found resident\nfellow-believers there, after 255 years of Arab domination. It was the\nChristians rather, who with the best intentions set the example of\nfanaticism during their crusades; these early Saracen raids had no more\nreligious colouring than our own raids into the Transvaal or elsewhere.\nThe Saracens were out for plunder and fresh lands, exactly like the\nEnglish. [Footnote: The behaviour of the Normans was wholly different\nfrom that of the Arabs, immediately on their occupation of the country\nthey razed to the ground thousands of Arab temples and sanctuaries. Of\nseveral hundred in Palermo alone, not a single one was left standing.]",
        "Nor were they tempted to destroy these monuments for decorative\npurposes, since they possessed no palaces on the mainland like the\nPalermitan Cuba or Zisa; and that sheer love of destructive-ness with\nwhich they have been credited certainly spared the marbles of Paestum\nwhich lay within a short distance of their strongholds, Agropoli and\nCetara. No. What earthquakes had left intact of these classic relics was\nniched by the Christians, who ransacked every corner of Italy for\nsuch treasures to adorn their own temples in Pisa, Rome and Venice–\ndisplaying small veneration for antiquity, but considerable taste.\nIn Calabria, for instance, the twenty granite pillars of the\ncathedral of Gerace were drawn from the ruins of old Locri; those of\nMelito came from the ancient Hipponium (Monteleone). So Paestum, after\nthe Saracens, became a regular quarry for the Lombards and the rich\ncitizens of Amalfi when they built their cathedral; and above all, for\nthe shrewdly pious Robert Guiscard. Altogether, these Normans, dreaming\nthrough the solstitial heats in pleasaunces like Ravello, developed a\nnice taste in the matter of marbles, and were not particular where they\ncame from, so long as they came from somewhere. The antiquities remained\nintact, at least, which was better than the subsequent system of Colonna\nand Frangipani, who burnt them into lime.",
        "Whatever one may think of the condition of Sicily under Arab rule, the\nproceedings of these strangers was wholly deplorable so far as the\nmainland of Italy was concerned. They sacked and burnt wherever they\nwent; the sea-board of the Tyrrhenian, Ionian and Adriatic was\ndepopulated of its inhabitants, who fled inland; towns and villages\nvanished from the face of the earth, and the richly cultivated land\nbecame a desert; they took 17,000 prisoners from Reggio on a single\noccasion–13,000 from Termula; they reduced Matera to such distress,\nthat a mother is said to have slaughtered and devoured her own child.\nSuch was their system on the mainland, where they swarmed. Their numbers\ncan be inferred from a letter written in 871 by the Emperor Ludwig II\nto the Byzantine monarch, in which he complains that “Naples has become\na second Palermo, a second Africa,” while three hundred years later, in\n1196, the Chancellor Konrad von Hildesheim makes a noteworthy\nobservation, which begins: “In Naples I saw the Saracens, who with their\nspittle destroy venomous beasts, and will briefly set forth how they\ncame by this virtue. . . .” [Footnote: He goes on to say, “Paulus\nApostolus naufragium passus, apud Capream insulam applicuit [sic] quae\nin Actibus Apostolorum Mitylene nuncupatur, et cum multis allis evadens,\nab indigenis tcrrae benigne acceptatus est.” Then follows the episode of\nthe fire and of the serpent which Paul casts from him; whereupon the\nSaracens, naturally enough, begin to adore him as a saint. In recompense\nfor this kind treatment Paul grants to them and their descendants the\npower of killing poisonous animals in the manner aforesaid–i.e. with\ntheir spittle–a superstition which is alive in south Italy to this day.\nThese gifted mortals are called Sanpaulari, or by the Greek word\nCerauli; they are men who are born either on St. Paul’s night (24-25\nJanuary) or on 29 June. Saint Paul, the “doctor of the Gentiles,” is a\ngreat wizard hereabouts, and an invocation to him runs as follows:\n\"Saint Paul, thou wonder-worker, kill this beast, which is hostile to\nGod; and save me, for I am a son of Maria.\"]",
        "It is therefore no exaggeration to say that the coastal regions of south\nItaly were practically in Arab possession for centuries, and one is\ntempted to dwell on their long semi-domination here because it has\naffected to this day the vocabulary of the people, their lore, their\narchitecture, their very faces–and to a far greater extent than a\nvisitor unacquainted with Moslem countries and habits would believe.\nSaracenism explains many anomalies in their mode of life and social\nconduct.",
        "From these troublous times dates, I should say, that use of the word\ncristiano applied to natives of the country–as opposed to Mohammedan\nenemies.",
        "“Saraceno” is still a common term of abuse.",
        "The fall of Luceria may be taken as a convenient time-boundary to mark\nthe end of the Saracenic period. A lull, but no complete repose from\nattacks, occurs between that event and the fall of Granada. Then begins\nthe activity of the corsairs. There is this difference between them,\nthat the corsairs merely paid flying visits; a change of wind, the\nappearance of an Italian sail, an unexpected resistance on the part of\nthe inhabitants, sufficed to unsettle their ephemeral plans. The\ncoast-lands were never in their possession; they only harried the\nnatives. The system of the Saracens on the mainland, though it seldom\nattained the form of a provincial or even military government, was\ndifferent. They had the animus manendi. Where they dined, they slept.",
        "In point of destructiveness, I should think there was little to choose\nbetween them. One thinks of the hundreds of villages the corsairs\ndevastated; the convents and precious archives they destroyed,\n[Footnote: In this particular branch, again, the Christians surpassed\nthe unbeliever. More archives were destroyed in the so-called “Age of\nLead\"–the closing period of Bour-bonism–than under Saracens and\nCorsairs combined. It was quite the regular thing to sell them as\nwaste-paper to the shopkeepers. Some of them escaped this fate by the\nveriest miracle–so those of the celebrated Certoza of San Lorenzo in\nPadula. The historian Marincola, walking in the market of Salerno,\nnoticed a piece of cheese wrapped up in an old parchment. He elicited\nthe fact that it came from this Certosa, intercepted the records on\ntheir way for sale in Salerno, and contrived by a small present to the\ndriver that next night two cartloads of parchments were deposited in the\nlibrary of La Cava.] the thousands of captives they carried\noff–sometimes in such numbers that the ships threatened to sink till\nthe more unsaleable portion of the human freight had been cast\noverboard. And it went on for centuries. Pirates and slave-hunters they\nwere; but not a whit more so than their Christian adversaries, on whose\nnational rivalries they thrived. African slaves, when not chained to the\ngalleys, were utilized on land; so the traveller Moore records that the\npalace of Caserta was built by gangs of slaves, half of them Italian,\nhalf Turkish. We have not much testimony as to whether these Arab slaves\nenjoyed their lot in European countries; but many of the Christians in\nAlgiers certainly enjoyed theirs. A considerable number of them refused\nto profit by Lord Exmouth’s arrangement for their ransom. I myself knew\nthe descendant of a man who had been thus sent back to his relations\nfrom captivity, and who soon enough returned to Africa, declaring that\nthe climate and religion of Europe were alike insupportable.",
        "In Saracen times the Venetians actually sold Christian slaves to the\nTurks. Parrino cites the severe enactments which were issued in the\nsixteenth century against Christian sailors who decoyed children on\nboard their boats and sold them as slaves to the Moslem. I question\nwhether the Turks were ever guilty of a corresponding infamy.",
        "This Parrino, by the way, is useful as showing the trouble to which the\nSpanish viceroys were put by the perpetual inroads of these Oriental\npests. Local militia were organized, heavy contributions levied, towers\nof refuge sprang up all along the coast–every respectable house had its\nprivate tower as well (for the dates, see G. del Giudice, Del Grande\nArchivio di Napoli, 1871, p. 108). The daring of the pirates knew no\nbounds; they actually landed a fleet at Naples itself, and carried off a\nnumber of prisoners. The entire kingdom, save the inland parts, was\nterrorized by their lightning-like descents.",
        "A particular literature grew up about this time–those “Lamenti” in\nrime, which set forth the distress of the various places they afflicted.",
        "The saints had work to do. Each divine protector fought for his own town\nor village, and sometimes we see the pleasing spectacle of two patrons\nof different localities joining their forces to ward off a piratical\nattack upon some threatened district by means of fiery hail, tempests,\napparitions and other celestial devices. A bellicose type of Madonna\nemerges, such as S. M. della Libera and S. M. di Constantinopoli, who\ndistinguishes herself by a fierce martial courage in the face of the\nenemy. There is no doubt that these inroads acted as a stimulus to the\nChristian faith; that they helped to seat the numberless patron saints\nof south Italy more firmly on their thrones. The Saracens as\nsaint-makers. . . .",
        "But despite occasional successes, the marine population suffered\nincreasingly. Historians like Summonte have left us descriptions of the\nprodigious exodus of the country people from Calabria and elsewhere into\nthe safer capital, and how the polished citizens detested these new\narrivals.",
        "The ominous name “Torre di Guardia” (tower of outlook)–a cliff whence\nthe sea was scanned for the appearance of Turkish vessels–survives all\nover the south. Barbarossa, too, has left his mark; many a hill,\nfountain or castle has been named after him. In the two Barbarossas were\nsummed up the highest qualities of the pirates, and it is curious to\nthink that the names of those scourges of Christendom, Uruj and\nKheir-eddin, should have been contracted into the classical forms of\nHorace and Ariadne. The picturesque Uruj was painted by Velasquez; the\nother entertained a polite epistolatory correspondence with Aretino, and\ndied, to his regret, “like a coward” in bed. I never visit\nConstantinople without paying my respects to that calm tomb at\nBeshiktah, where, after life’s fitful fever, sleeps the Chief of the Sea.",
        "And so things went on till recently. K. Ph. Moritz writes that King\nFerdinand of Naples, during his sporting excursions to the islands of\nhis dominions, was always accompanied by two cruisers, to forestall the\nchance of his being carried off by these Turchi. But his loyal\nsubjects had no cruisers at their disposal; they lived Turcarum\npraedonibus semper obnoxii. Who shall calculate the effects of this\nlong reign of terror on the national mind?",
        "For a thousand years–from 830 to 1830–from the days when the\nAmalfitans won the proud title of “Defenders of the Faith” up to those\nof the sentimental poet Waiblinger (1826), these shores were infested by\nOriental ruffians, whose activities were an unmitigated evil. It is all\nvery well for Admiral de la Graviere to speak of “Gallia Victrix\"–the\nAmericans, too, might have something to say on that point. The fact is\nthat neither European nor American arms crushed the pest. But for the\ninvention of steam, the Barbary corsairs might still be with us.",
        "It has a pleasant signification, that word “Dolcedorme”: it means\nSweet slumber. But no one could tell me how the mountain group came by\nthis name; they gave me a number of explanations, all fanciful and\nunconvincing. Pollino, we are told, is derived from Apollo, and authors\nof olden days sometimes write of it as “Monte Apollino.” But Barrius\nsuggests an alternative etymology, equally absurd, and connected with\nthe medicinal herbs which are found there. Pollino, he says, a\npolleo dictus, quod nobilibus herbis medelae commodis polleat. Pro-venit\nenim ibi, ut ab herbariis accepi, tragium dictamnum Cretense, chamaeleon\nbigenum, draucus, meum, nardus, celtica, anonides, anemone, peucedamum,\nturbit, reubarbarum, pyrethrum, juniperus ubertim, stellarla,\nimperatoria, cardus masticem fundens, dracagas, cythisus–whence\nlikewise the magnificent cheeses; gold and the Phrygian stone, he adds,\nare also found here.",
        "Unhappily Barrius–we all have a fling at this “Strabo and Pliny of\nCalabria”! So jealous was he of his work that he procured a prohibition\nfrom the Pope against all who might reprint it, and furthermore invoked\nthe curses of heaven and earth upon whoever should have the audacity to\ntranslate it into Italian. Yet his shade ought to be appeased with the\nmonumental edition of 1737, and, as regards his infallibility, one must\nnot forget that among his contemporaries the more discerning had already\ncensured his philopatria, his immoderate love of Calabria. And that is\nthe right way to judge of men who were not so much ignorant as unduly\nzealous for the fair name of their natal land. To sneer at them is to\nmisjudge their period. It was the very spirit of the Renaissance to\npress rhetorical learning into the service of patriotism. They made some\nhappy guesses and not a few mistakes; and when they lied deliberately,\nit was done in what they held a just cause–as scholars and gentlemen.",
        "The Calabria Illustrata of Fiore also fares badly at the hands of\ncritics. But I shall not repeat what they say; I confess to a sneaking\nfondness for Father Fiore.",
        "Marafioti, a Calabrian monk, likewise dwells on these same herbs of\nPollino, and gives a long account of a medical secret which he learnt on\nthe spot from two Armenian botanists. Alas for Marafioti! Despite his\nexcellent index and seductively chaste Paduan type and paper, the\nimpartial Soria is driven to say that “to make his shop appear more rich\nin foreign merchandise, he did not scruple to adorn it with books and\nauthors apocryphal, imaginary, and unknown to the whole human race.” In\nshort, he belonged to the school of Pratilli, who wrote a wise and\nedifying history of Capua on the basis of inscriptions which he himself\nhad previously forged; of Ligorio Pirro, prince of his tribe, who\nmanufactured thousands of coins, texts and marbles out of sheer\nexuberance of creative artistry!",
        "Gone are those happy days of authorship, when the constructive\nimagination was not yet blighted and withered. . . .",
        "Marching comfortably, it will take you nearly twelve hours to go from\nMorano to the village of Terranova di Pollino, which I selected as my\nfirst night-quarter. This includes a scramble up the peak of Pollino,\nlocally termed “telegrafo,” from a pile of stones–? an old\nsignal-station–erected on the summit. But since decent accommodation\ncan only be obtained at Castrovillari, a start should be made from\nthere, and this adds another hour to the trip. Moreover, as the peak of\nPollino lies below that of Dolcedorme, which shuts oil a good deal of\nits view seaward, this second mountain ought rather to be ascended, and\nthat will probably add yet another hour–fourteen altogether. The\nnatives, ever ready to say what they think will please you, call it a\nsix hours’ excursion. As a matter of fact, although I spoke to numbers\nof the population of Morano, I only met two men who had ever been to\nTerranova, one of them being my muleteer; the majority had not so much\nas heard its name. They dislike mountains and torrents and forests, not\nonly as an offence to the eye, but as hindrances to agriculture and\nenemies of man and his ordered ways. “La montagna” is considerably\nabused, all over Italy.",
        "It takes an hour to cross the valley and reach the slopes of the\nopposite hills. Here, on the plain, lie the now faded blossoms of the\nmonstrous arum, the botanical glory of these regions. To see it in\nflower, in early June, is alone almost worth the trouble of a journey to\nCalabria.",
        "On a shady eminence at the foot of these mountains, in a most\npicturesque site, there stands a large castellated building, a\nmonastery. It is called Colorito, and is now a ruin; the French, they\nsay, shelled it for harbouring the brigand-allies of Bourbonism. Nearly\nall convents in the south, and even in Naples, were at one time or\nanother refuges of bandits, and this association of monks and robbers\nused to give much trouble to conscientious politicians. It is a solitary\nbuilding, against the dark hill-side; a sombre and romantic pile such as\nwould have charmed Anne Radcliffe; one longs to explore its recesses.\nBut I dreaded the coming heats of midday. Leone da Morano, who died in\n1645, belonged to this congregation, and was reputed an erudite\necclesiastic. The life of one of its greatest luminaries, Fra Bernardo\nda Rogliano, was described by Tufarelli in a volume which I have never\nbeen able to catch sight of. It must be very rare, yet it certainly was\nprinted. [Footnote: Haym has no mention of this work. But it is fully\nquoted in old Toppi’s “Biblioteca” (p. 317), and also referred to in\nSavonarola’s “Universus Terrarum,” etc. (1713, Vol. I, p. 216). Both say\nit was printed at Cosenza; the first, in 1650; the second, in 1630.]",
        "The path ascends now through a long and wearisome limestone gap called\nValle di Gaudolino, only the last half-hour of the march being shaded by\ntrees. It was in this gully that an accidental encounter took place\nbetween a detachment of French soldiers and part of the band of the\ncelebrated brigand Scarolla, whom they had been pursuing for months all\nover the country. The brigands were sleeping when the others fell upon\nthem, killing numbers and carrying off a large booty; so rich it was,\nthat the soldiers were seen playing at “petis palets\"–whatever that may\nbe–with quadruples of Spain–whatever that may be. Scarolla escaped\nwounded, but was afterwards handed over to justice, for a consideration\nof a thousand ducats, by some shepherds with whom he had taken refuge;\nand duly hanged. His band consisted of four thousand ruffians; it was\none of several that infested south Italy. This gives some idea of the\nmagnitude of the evil.",
        "It was my misfortune that after weeks of serene weather this particular\nmorning should be cloudy. There was sunshine in the valley below, but\nwreaths of mist were skidding over the summit of Pollino; the view, I\nfelt sure, would be spoilt. And so it was. Through swiftly-careering\ncloud-drifts I caught glimpses of the plain and the blue Ionian; of the\nSila range confronting me; of the peak of Dolcedorme to the left, and\nthe “Montagna del Principe” on the right; of the large forest region at\nmy back. Tantalizing visions!",
        "Viewed from below, this Pollino is shaped like a pyramid, and promises\nrather a steep climb over bare limestone; but the ascent is quite easy.\nNo trees grow on the pyramid. The rock is covered with a profusion of\nforget-me-nots and gay pansies; some mez-ereon and a few dwarfed\njunipers–earthward-creeping–nearly reach the summit. When I passed\nhere on a former trip, on the 6th of June, this peak was shrouded in\nsnow. There are some patches of snow even now, one of them descending in\nglacier fashion down the slope on the other side; they call it\n\"eternal,” but I question whether it will survive the heats of autumn.\nBeyond a brace of red-legged partridges, I saw no birds whatever. This\ngroup of Pollino, descending its seven thousand feet in a precipitous\nflight of terraces to the plain of Sibari, is an imposing finale to\nthe Apennines that have run hitherward, without a break, from Genoa and\nBologna. Westward of this spot there are mountains galore; but no more\nApennines; no more limestone precipices. The boundary of the old\nprovinces of Calabria and Basilicata ran over this spot. . . .",
        "I was glad to descend once more, and to reach the Altipiano di\nPollino–an Alpine meadow with a little lake (the merest puddle),\nbright with rare and beautiful flowers. It lies 1780 metres above\nsea-level, and no one who visits these regions should omit to see this\nexquisite tract encircled by mountain peaks, though it lies a little off\nthe usual paths. Strawberries, which I had eaten at Rossano, had not yet\nopened their flowers here; the flora, boreal in parts, has been studied\nby Terracciano and other Italian botanists.",
        "It was on this verdant, flower-enamelled mead that, fatigued with the\nclimb, I thought to try the powers of my riding mule. But the beast\nproved vicious; there was no staying on her back. A piece of string\nattached to her nose by way of guiding-rope was useless as a rein; she\nhad no mane wherewith I might have steadied myself in moments of danger,\nand as to seizing her ears for that purpose, it was out of the question,\nfor hardly was I in the saddle before her head descended to the ground\nand there remained, while her hinder feet essayed to touch the stars.\nAfter a succession of ignominious and painful flights to earth, I\ncomplained to her owner, who had been watching the proceedings with\nquiet interest.",
        "“That lady-mule,” he said, “is good at carrying loads. But she has never\nhad a Christian on her back till now. I was rather curious to see how\nshe would behave.”",
        "“Santo Dio! And do you expect me to pay four francs a day for having\nmy bones broken in this fashion?”",
        "“What would you, sir? She is still young–barely four years old. Only\nwait! Wait till she is ten or twelve.”",
        "To do him justice, however, he tried to make amends in other ways. And\nhe certainly knew the tracks. But he was a returned emigrant, and when\nan Italian has once crossed the ocean he is useless for my purposes, he\nhas lost his savour–the virtue has gone out of him. True Italians will\nsoon be rare as the dodo in these parts. These americani cast off\ntheir ancient animistic traits and patriarchal disposition with the ease\nof a serpent; a new creature emerges, of a wholly different\ncharacter–sophisticated, extortionate at times, often practical and in\nso far useful; scorner of every tradition, infernally wideawake and\ncuriously deficient in what the Germans call “Gemuet” (one of those\nwords which we sadly need in our own language). Instead of being regaled\nwith tales of Saint Venus and fairies and the Evil Eye, I learnt a good\ndeal about the price of food in the Brazilian highlands.",
        "The only piece of local information I was able to draw from him\nconcerned a mysterious plant in the forest that “shines by night.” I\ndare say he meant the dictamnus fraxinella, which is sometimes luminous.",
        "The finest part of the forest was traversed in the afternoon. It is\ncalled Janace, and composed of firs and beeches. The botanist Tenore\nsays that firs 150 feet in height are “not difficult to find” here, and\nsome of the beeches, a forestal inspector assured me, attain the height\nof 35 metres. They shoot up in straight silvery trunks; their roots are\noften intertwined with those of the firs. The track is not level by any\nmeans. There are torrents to be crossed; rocky ravines with splashing\nwaters where the sunshine pours down through a dense network of branches\nupon a carpet of russet leaves and grey boulders–the envious beeches\nallowing of no vegetation at their feet; occasional meadows, too, bright\nwith buttercups and orchids. No pines whatever grow in this forest. Yet\na few stunted ones are seen clinging to the precipices that descend into\nthe Coscile valley; their seeds may have been wafted across from the\nSila mountains.",
        "In olden days all this country was full of game; bears, stags and\nfallow-deer are mentioned. Only wolves and a few roe-deer are now left.\nThe forest is sombre, but not gloomy, and one would like to spend some\ntime in these wooded regions, so rare in Italy, and to study their life\nand character–but how set about it? The distances are great; there are\nno houses, not even a shepherd’s hut or a cave; the cold at night is\nsevere, and even in the height of midsummer one must be prepared for\nspells of mist and rain. I shall be tempted, on another occasion, to\nprovide myself with a tent such as is supplied to military officers.\nThey are light and handy, and perhaps camping out with a man-cook of the\nkind that one finds in the Abruzzi provinces would be altogether the\nbest way of seeing the remoter parts of south and central Italy. For\ndecent food-supplies can generally be obtained in the smallest places;\nthe drawback is that nobody can cook them. Dirty food by day and dirty\nbeds by night will daunt the most enterprising natures in the long run.",
        "These tracks are only traversed in summer. When I last walked through\nthis region–in the reverse direction, from Lagonegro over Latronico and\nSan Severino to Castrovillari–the ground was still covered with\nstretches of snow, and many brooks were difficult to cross from the\nswollen waters. This was in June. It was odd to see the beeches rising,\nin full leaf, out of the deep snow.",
        "During this afternoon ramble I often wondered what the burghers of\nTaranto would think of these sylvan solitudes. Doubtless they would\nshare the opinion of a genteel photographer of Morano who showed me some\ncoloured pictures of local brides in their appropriate costumes, such as\nare sent to relatives in America after weddings. He possessed a good\ncamera, and I asked whether he had never made any pictures of this fine\nforest scenery. No, he said; he had only once been to the festival of\nthe Madonna di Pollino, but he went alone–his companion, an\navvocato, got frightened and failed to appear at the last moment.",
        "“So I went alone,” he said, “and those forests, it must be confessed,\nare too savage to be photographed. Now, if my friend had come, he might\nhave posed for me, sitting comically at the foot of a tree, with crossed\nlegs, and smoking a cigar, like this. ... Or he might have pretended to\nbe a wood-cutter, bending forwards and felling a tree . . . tac, tac,\ntac . . . without his jacket, of course. That would have made a picture.\nBut those woods and mountains, all by themselves–no! The camera\nrevolts. In photography, as in all good art, the human element must\npredominate.”",
        "It is sad to think that in a few years’ time nearly all these forests\nwill have ceased to exist; another generation will hardly recognize the\nsite of them. A society from Morbegno (Valtellina) has acquired rights\nover the timber, and is hewing down as fast as it can. They import their\nown workmen from north Italy, and have built at a cost of two million\nfrancs (say the newspapers) a special funicular railway, 23 kilometres\nlong, to carry the trunks from the mountain to Francavilla at its foot,\nwhere they are sawn up and conveyed to the railway station of Cerchiara,\nnear Sibari. This concession, I am told, extends to twenty-five\nyears–they have now been at work for two, and the results are already\napparent in some almost bare slopes once clothed with these huge\nprimeval trees.",
        "There are inspectors, some of them conscientious, to see that a due\nproportion of the timber is left standing; but we all know what the\naverage Italian official is, and must be, considering his salary. One\ncould hardly blame them greatly if, as I have been assured is the case,\nthey often sell the wood which they are paid to protect.",
        "The same fate is about to overtake the extensive hill forests which lie\non the watershed between Morano and the Tyrrhenian. These, according to\na Castrovillari local paper, have lately been sold to a German firm for\nexploitation.",
        "It is useless to lament the inevitable–this modern obsession of\n\"industrialism” which has infected a country purely agricultural. Nor is\nit any great compensation to observe that certain small tracts of\nhill-side behind Morano are being carefully reafforested by the\nGovernment at this moment. Whoever wishes to see these beautiful\nstretches of woodland ere their disappearance from earth–let him hasten!",
        "After leaving the forest region it is a downhill walk of nearly three\nhours to reach Terranova di Pollino, which lies, only 910 metres above\nsea-level, against the slope of a wide and golden amphitheatre of hills,\nat whose entrance the river Sarmento has carved itself a prodigious\ngateway through the rock. A dirty little place; the male inhabitants are\nnearly all in America; the old women nearly all afflicted with goitre. I\nwas pleased to observe the Calabrian system of the house-doors, which\nlife in civilized places had made me forget. These doors are divided\ninto two portions, not vertically like ours, but horizontally. The upper\nportion is generally open, in order that the housewife sitting within\nmay have light and air in her room, and an opportunity of gossiping with\nher neighbours across the street; the lower part is closed, to prevent\nthe pigs in the daytime from entering the house (where they sleep at\nnight). The system testifies to social instincts and a certain sense of\nrefinement.",
        "The sights of Terranova are soon exhausted. They had spoken to me of a\nhouse near the woods, about four hours distant, inhabited just now by\nshepherds. Thither we started, next day, at about 3 p.m.",
        "The road climbs upwards through bare country till it reaches a dusky\npinnacle of rock, a conspicuous landmark, which looks volcanic but is\nnothing of the kind. It bears the name of Pietra-Sasso–the explanation\nof this odd pleonasm being, I suppose, that here the whole mass of rock,\ngenerally decked with grass or shrubs, is as bare as any single stone.",
        "There followed a pleasant march through pastoral country of streamlets\nand lush grass, with noble views downwards on our right, over\nmany-folded hills into the distant valley of the Sinno. To the left is\nthe forest region. But the fir trees are generally mutilated–their\nlower branches lopped off; and the tree resents this treatment and often\ndies, remaining a melancholy stump among the beeches. They take these\nbranches not for fuel, but as fodder for the cows. A curious kind of\nfodder, one thinks; but Calabrian cows will eat anything, and their milk\ntastes accordingly. No wonder the natives prefer even the greasy fluid\nof their goats to that of cows.",
        "“How?” they will ask, “You Englishmen, with all your money–you drink\nthe milk of cows?”",
        "Goats are over-plentiful here, and the hollies, oaks and thorns along\nthe path have been gnawed by them into quaint patterns like the\ntopiarian work in old-fashioned gardens. If they find nothing to their\ntaste on the ground, they actually climb trees; I have seen them\nbrowsing thus, at six feet above the ground. These miserable beasts are\nthe ruin of south Italy, as they are of the whole Mediterranean basin.\nWhat malaria and the Barbary pirates have done to the sea-board, the\ngoats have accomplished for the regions further inland; and it is really\ntime that sterner legislation were introduced to limit their\ngrazing-places and incidentally reduce their numbers, as has been done\nin parts of the Abruzzi, to the great credit of the authorities. But the\nsubject is a well-worn one.",
        "The solitary little house which now appeared before us is called\n\"Vitiello,” presumably from its owner or builder, a proprietor of the\nvillage of Noepoli. It stands in a charming site, with a background of\nwoodland whence rivulets trickle down–the immediate surroundings are\ncovered with pasture and bracken and wild pear trees smothered in\nflowering dog-roses. I strolled about in the sunset amid tinkling herds\nof sheep and goats that were presently milked and driven into their\nenclosure of thorns for the night, guarded by four or five of those\nsavage white dogs of the Campagna breed. Despite these protectors, the\nwolf carried off two sheep yesterday, in broad daylight. The flocks come\nto these heights in the middle of June, and descend again in October.",
        "The shepherds offered us the only fare they possessed–the much-belauded\nPollino cheeses, the same that were made, long ago, by Polyphemus\nhimself. You can get them down at a pinch, on the principle of the\nGerman proverb, “When the devil is hungry, he eats flies.” Fortunately\nour bags still contained a varied assortment, though my man had\ndeveloped an appetite and a thirst that did credit to his Berserker\nancestry.",
        "We retired early. But long after the rest of them were snoring hard I\ncontinued awake, shivering under my blanket and choking with the acrid\nsmoke of a fire of green timber. The door had been left ajar to allow it\nto escape, but the only result of this arrangement was that a glacial\nblast of wind swept into the chamber from outside. The night was\nbitterly cold, and the wooden floor on which I was reposing seemed to be\nharder than the majority of its kind. I thought with regret of the tepid\nnights of Taranto and Castrovillari, and cursed my folly for climbing\ninto these Arctic regions; wondering, as I have often done, what demon\nof restlessness or perversity drives one to undertake such insane\nexcursions.",
        "Leaving the hospitable shepherds in the morning, we arrived after\nmidday, by devious woodland paths, at the Madonna di Pollino. This\nsolitary fane is perched, like an eagle’s nest, on the edge of a cliff\noverhanging the Frida torrent. Owing to this fact, and to its great\nelevation, the views inland are wonderful; especially towards evening,\nwhen crude daylight tints fade away and range after range of mountains\nreveal themselves, their crests outlined against each other in tender\ngradations of mauve and grey. The prospect is closed, at last, by the\nlofty groups of Sirino and Alburno, many long leagues away. On all other\nsides are forests, interspersed with rock. But near at hand lies a\nspacious green meadow, at the foot of a precipice. This is now covered\nwith encampments in anticipation of to-morrow’s festival, and the\nbacchanal is already in full swing.",
        "Very few foreigners, they say, have attended this annual feast, which\ntakes place on the first Saturday and Sunday of July, and is worth\ncoming a long way to see. Here the old types, uncon-taminated by\nmodernism and emigration, are still gathered together. The whole\ncountry-side is represented; the peasants have climbed up with their\nentire households from thirty or forty villages of this thinly populated\nland, some of them marching a two days’ journey; the greater the\ndistance, the greater the “divozione” to the Mother of God. Piety\nconquers rough tracks, as old Bishop Paulinus sang, nearly fifteen\nhundred years ago.",
        "It is a vast picnic in honour of the Virgin. Two thousand persons are\nencamped about the chapel, amid a formidable army of donkeys and mules\nwhose braying mingles with the pastoral music of reeds and\nbagpipes–bagpipes of two kinds, the common Calabrian variety and that\nof Basilicata, much larger and with a resounding base key, which will\nsoon cease to exist. A heaving ebb and flow of humanity fills the eye;\nfires are flickering before extempore shelters, and an ungodly amount of\nfood is being consumed, as traditionally prescribed for such\noccasions–\"si mangia per divozione.” On all sides picturesque groups of\ndancers indulge in the old peasants’ measure, the percorara, to the\ndroning of bagpipes–a demure kind of tarantella, the male capering\nabout with faun-like attitudes of invitation and snappings of fingers,\nhis partner evading the advances with downcast eyes. And the church\nmeanwhile, is filled to overflowing; orations and services follow one\nanother without interruption; the priests are having a busy time of it.",
        "The rocky pathway between this chapel and the meadow is obstructed by\nfolk and lined on either side with temporary booths of green branches,\nwhose owners vociferously extol the merits of their wares–cloths,\nwoollens, umbrellas, hot coffee, wine, fresh meat, fruit, vegetables\n(the spectre of cholera is abroad, but no one heeds)–as well as gold\nwatches, rings and brooches, many of which will be bought ere to-morrow\nmorning, in memory of to-night’s tender meetings. The most interesting\nshops are those which display ex-votos, waxen reproductions of various\nailing parts of the body which have been miraculously cured by the\nVirgin’s intercession: arms, legs, fingers, breasts, eyes. There are\nalso entire infants of wax. Strangest of all of them is a many-tinted\nand puzzling waxen symbol which sums up all the internal organs of the\nabdomen in one bold effort of artistic condensation; a kind of heraldic,\nmaterialized stomache-ache. I would have carried one away with me, had\nthere been the slightest chance of its remaining unbroken. [Footnote: A\ngood part of these, I dare say, arc intended to represent the enlarged\nspleen of malaria. In old Greece, says Dr. W. H. D. Rouse, votives of\nthe trunk are commonest, after the eyes–malaria, again.]",
        "These are the votive offerings which catch the visitor’s eye in southern\nchurches, and were beloved not only of heathendom, but of the neolithic\ngentry; a large deposit has been excavated at Taranto; the British\nMuseum has some of marble, from Athens; others were of silver, but the\nmajority terra-cotta. The custom must have entered Christianity in early\nages, for already Theo-doret, who died in 427, says, “some bring images\nof eyes, others of feet, others of hands; and sometimes they are made of\ngold, sometimes of silver. These votive gifts testify to cure of\nmaladies.” Nowadays, when they become too numerous, they are melted down\nfor candles; so Pericles, in some speech, talks of selling them for the\nbenefit of the commonwealth.",
        "One is struck with the feast of costumes here, by far the brightest\nbeing those of the women who have come up from the seven or eight\nAlbanian villages that surround these hills. In their variegated array\nof chocolate-brown and white, of emerald-green and gold and flashing\nviolet, these dames move about the sward like animated tropical flowers.\nBut the Albanian girls of Civita stand out for aristocratic\nelegance–pleated black silk gowns, discreetly trimmed with gold and\nwhite lace, and open at the breast. The women of Morano, too, make a\nbrave show.",
        "Night brings no respite; on the contrary, the din grows livelier than\never; fires gleam brightly on the meadow and under the trees; the\ndancers are unwearied, the bagpipers with their brazen lungs show no\nsigns of exhaustion. And presently the municipal music of Castrovillari,\nspecially hired for the occasion, ascends an improvised bandstand and\npours brisk strains into the night. Then the fireworks begin,\nsensational fireworks, that have cost a mint of money; flaring wheels\nand fiery devices that send forth a pungent odour; rockets of many hues,\nlighting up the leafy recesses, and scaring the owls and wolves for\nmiles around.",
        "Certain persons have told me that if you are of a prying disposition,\nnow is the time to observe amorous couples walking hand in hand into the\ngloom–passionate young lovers from different villages, who have looked\nforward to this night of all the year on the chance of meeting, at last,\nin a fervent embrace under the friendly beeches. These same stern men\n(they are always men) declare that such nocturnal festivals are a\ndisgrace to civilization; that the Greek Comedy, long ago, reprobated\nthem as disastrous to the morals of females–that they were condemned by\nthe Council of Elvira, by Vigilantius of Marseilles and by the great\nSaint Jerome, who wrote that on such occasions no virgin should wander a\nhand’s-breadth from her mother. They wish you to believe that on these\nwarm summer nights, when the pulses of nature are felt and senses\nstirred with music and wine and dance, the Gran Madre di Dio is adored\nin a manner less becoming Christian youths and maidens, than heathens\ncelebrating mad orgies to Magna Mater in Daphne, or the Babylonian\ngroves (where she was not worshipped at all–though she might have been).",
        "In fact, they insinuate that----",
        "It may well be true. What were the moralists doing there?",
        "Festivals like this are relics of paganism, and have my cordial\napproval. We English ought to have learnt by this time that the\nrepression of pleasure is a dangerous error. In these days when even\nItaly, the grey-haired cocotte, has become tainted with\nAnglo-Pecksniffian principles, there is nothing like a little\ntime-honoured bestiality for restoring the circulation and putting\nthings to rights generally. On ethical grounds alone–as\nsafety-valves–such nocturnal feasts ought to be kept up in regions such\nas these, where the country-folk have not our “facilities.” Who would\ngrudge them these primordial joys, conducted under the indulgent\nmotherly eye of Madonna, and hallowed by antiquity and the starlit\nheavens above? Every one is so happy and well-behaved. No bawling, no\nquarrelsomeness, no staggering tipplers; a spirit of universal good\ncheer broods over the assembly. Involuntarily, one thinks of the\ndrunkard-strewn field of battle at the close of our Highland games; one\nthinks of God-fearing Glasgow on a Saturday evening, and of certain\nother aspects of Glasgow life. . . .",
        "I accepted the kindly proffered invitation of the priests to share their\ndinner; they held out hopes of some sort of sleeping accommodation as\nwell. It was a patriarchal hospitality before that fire of logs (the\nnight had grown chilly), and several other guests partook of it,\nforestal inspectors and such-like notabilities–one lady among them who,\ntrue to feudal traditions, hardly spoke a word the whole evening. I was\nstruck, as I have sometimes been, at the attainments of these country\npriests; they certainly knew our Gargantuan novelists of the Victorian\nepoch uncommonly well. Can it be that these great authors are more\nreadable in Italian translations than in the original? One of them took\nto relating, in a strain of autumnal humour, experiences of his life in\nthe wilds of Bolivia, where he had spent many years among the Indians;\nmy neighbour, meanwhile, proved to be steeped in Horatian lore. It was\nhis pet theory, supported by a wealth of aptly cited lines, that Horace\nwas a “typical Italian countryman,” and great was his delight on\ndiscovering that I shared his view and could even add another–somewhat\nimproper–utterance of the poet’s to his store of illustrative quotations.",
        "They belonged to the old school, these sable philosophers; to the days\nwhen the priest was arbiter of life and death, and his mere word\nsufficient to send a man to the galleys; when the cleverest boys of\nwealthy and influential families were chosen for the secular career and\ncarefully, one might say liberally, trained to fulfil those responsible\nfunctions. The type is becoming extinct, the responsibility is gone, the\nprofession has lost its glamour; and only the clever sons of pauper\nfamilies, or the dull ones of the rich, are now tempted to forsake the\nworldly path.",
        "Regarding the origin of this festival, I learned that it was\n\"tradition.” It had been suggested to me that the Virgin had appeared to\na shepherd in some cave near at hand–the usual Virgin, in the usual\ncave; a cave which, in the present instance, no one was able to point\nout to me. Est traditio, ne quaeras amplius.",
        "My hosts answered questions on this subject with benignant ambiguity,\nand did not trouble to defend the divine apparition on the sophistical\nlines laid down in Riccardi’s “Santuari.” The truth, I imagine, is that\nthey have very sensibly not concerned themselves with inventing an\noriginal legend. The custom of congregating here on these fixed days\nseems to be recent, and I am inclined to think that it has been called\ninto being by the zeal of some local men of standing. On the other hand,\na shrine may well have stood for many years on this spot, for it marks\nthe half-way house in the arduous two days’ journey between San Severino\nand Castro-villari, a summer trek that must date from hoary antiquity.",
        "Our bedroom contained two rough couches which were to be shared between\nfour priests and myself. Despite the fact that I occupied the place of\nhonour between the two oldest and wisest of my ghostly entertainers,\nsleep refused to come; the din outside had grown to a pandemonium. I lay\nawake till, at 2.30 a.m., one of them arose and touched the others with\na whispered and half-jocular oremus! They retired on tiptoe to the\nnext room, noiselessly closing the door, to prepare themselves for early\nservice. I could hear them splashing vigorously at their ablutions in\nthe icy water, and wondered dreamily how many Neapolitan priests would\nindulge at that chill hour of the morning in such a lustrai rite,\nprescribed as it is by the rules of decency and of their church.",
        "After that, I stretched forth at my ease and endeavoured to repose\nseriously. There were occasional lulls, now, in the carnival, but\nexplosions of sound still broke the stillness, and phantoms of the\nrestless throng began to chase each other through my brain. The exotic\ncostumes of the Albanian girls in their green and gold wove themselves\ninto dreams and called up colours seen in Northern Africa during still\nwilder festivals–negro festivals such as Fro-mentin loved to depict. In\nspectral dance there flitted before my vision nightmarish throngs of\ndusky women bedizened in that same green and gold; Arabs I saw, riding\ntumultuously hither and thither with burnous flying in the wind; beggars\ncrawling about the hot sand and howling for alms; ribbons and flags\nflying–a blaze of sunshine overhead, and on earth a seething orgy of\ncolour and sound; methought I heard the guttural yells of the\nfruit-vendors, musketry firing, braying of asses, the demoniacal groans\nof the camels-----",
        "Was it really a camel? No. It was something infinitely worse, and within\na few feet of my ears. I sprang out of bed. There, at the very window,\nstood a youth extracting unearthly noises out of the Basilicata bagpipe.\nTo be sure! I remembered expressing an interest in this rare instrument\nto one of my hosts who, with subtle delicacy, must have ordered the boy\nto give me a taste of his quality–to perform a matutinal serenade, for\nmy especial benefit. How thoughtful these people are. It was not quite 4\na.m. With some regret, I said farewell to sleep and stumbled out of\ndoors, where my friends of yesterday evening were already up and doing.\nThe eating, the dancing, the bagpipes–they were all in violent\nactivity, under the sober and passionless eye of morning.",
        "A gorgeous procession took place about midday. Like a many-coloured\nserpent it wound out of the chapel, writhed through the intricacies of\nthe pathway, and then unrolled itself freely, in splendid convolutions,\nabout the sunlit meadow, saluted by the crash of mortars, bursts of\nmilitary music from the band, chanting priests and women, and all the\nbagpipers congregated in a mass, each playing his own favourite tune.\nThe figure of the Madonna–a modern and unprepossessing image–was\ncarried aloft, surrounded by resplendent ecclesiastics and followed by a\npicturesque string of women bearing their votive offerings of candles,\ngreat and small. Several hundredweight of wax must have been brought up\non the heads of pious female pilgrims. These multi-coloured candles are\narranged in charming designs; they are fixed upright in a framework of\nwood, to resemble baskets or bird-cages, and decked with bright ribbons\nand paper flowers.",
        "Who settles the expenses of such a festival? The priests, in the first\nplace, have paid a good deal to make it attractive; they have improved\nthe chapel, constructed a number of permanent wooden shelters (rain\nsometimes spoils the proceedings), as well as a capacious reservoir for\nholding drinking water, which has to be transported in barrels from a\nconsiderable distance. Then–as to the immediate outlay for music,\nfireworks, and so forth–the Madonna-statue is “put up to auction”:\nfanno l’incanto della Madonna, as they say; that is, the privilege of\nhelping to carry the idol from the church and back in the procession is\nsold to the highest bidders. Inasmuch as She is put up for auction\nseveral times during this short perambulation, fresh enthusiasts coming\nforward gaily with bank-notes and shoulders–whole villages competing\nagainst each other–a good deal of money is realized in this way. There\nare also spontaneous gifts of money. Goats and sheep, too, decorated\nwith coloured rags, are led up by peasants who have “devoted” them to\nthe Mother of God; the butchers on the spot buy these beasts for\nslaughter, and their price goes to swell the funds.",
        "This year’s expenditure may have been a thousand francs or so, and the\nproceeds are calculated at about two-thirds of that sum.",
        "No matter. If the priests do not make good the deficiency, some one else\nwill be kind enough to step forward. Better luck next year! The\nfestival, they hope, is to become more popular as time goes on, despite\nthe chilling prophecy of one of our friends: “It will finish, this\ncomedy!” The money, by the way, does not pass through the hands of the\nclerics, but of two individuals called “Regolatore” and “Priore,” who\nmutually control each other. They are men of reputable families, who\nburden themselves with the troublesome task for the honour of the thing,\nand make up any deficiencies in the accounts out of their own pockets.\nCases of malversation are legendary.",
        "This procession marked the close of the religious gathering. Hardly was\nit over before there began a frenzied scrimmage of departure. And soon\nthe woodlands echoed with the laughter and farewellings of pilgrims\nreturning homewards by divergent paths; the whole way through the\nforest, we formed part of a jostling caravan along the\nCastrovillari-Morano track–how different from the last time I had\ntraversed this route, when nothing broke the silence save a chaffinch\npiping among the branches or the distant tap of some woodpecker!",
        "So ended the festa. Once in the year this mountain chapel is rudely\ndisquieted in its slumbers by a boisterous riot; then it sinks again\ninto tranquil oblivion, while autumn dyes the beeches to gold. And very\nsoon the long winter comes; chill tempests shake the trees and leaves\nare scattered to earth; towards Yuletide some woodman of Viggianello\nadventuring into these solitudes, and mindful of their green summer\nrevels, discovers his familiar sanctuary entombed up to the door-lintle\nunder a glittering sheet of snow. . . .",
        "There was a little episode in the late afternoon. We had reached the\nfoot of the Gaudolino valley and begun the crossing of the plain, when\nthere met us a woman with dishevelled hair, weeping bitterly and showing\nother signs of distress; one would have thought she had been robbed or\nbadly hurt. Not at all! Like the rest of us, she had attended the feast\nand, arriving home with the first party, had been stopped at the\nentrance of the town, where they had insisted upon fumigating her\nclothes as a precaution against cholera, and those of her companions.\nThat was all. But the indignity choked her–she had run back to warn the\nrest of us, all of whom were to be treated to the same outrage. Every\napproach to Morano, she declared, was watched by doctors, to prevent\nwary pilgrims from entering by unsuspected paths.",
        "During her recital my muleteer had grown thoughtful.",
        "“What’s to be done?” he asked.",
        "“I don’t much mind fumigation,” I replied.",
        "“Oh, but I do! I mind it very much. And these doctors are so dreadfully\ndistrustful. How shall we cheat them? ... I have it, I have it!”",
        "And he elaborated the following stratagem:",
        "“I go on ahead of you, alone, leading the two mules. You follow, out of\nsight, behind. And what happens? When I reach the doctor, he asks slyly:\n’Well, and how did you enjoy the festival this year?’ Then I say:\n’Not this year, doctor; alas, no festival for me! I’ve been with an\nEnglishman collecting beetles in the forest, and see? here’s his riding\nmule. He walks on behind–oh, quite harmless, doctor! a nice gentleman,\nindeed–only, he prefers walking; he really likes it, ha, ha, ha!-----”",
        "“Why mention about my walking?” I interrupted. The lady-mule was still a\nsore subject.",
        "“I mention about your not riding,” he explained graciously, “because it\nwill seem to the doctor a sure sign that you are a little\"–here he\ntouched his forehead with a significant gesture–\"a little like some\nother foreigners, you know. And that, in its turn, will account for your\ncollecting beetles. And that, in its turn, will account for your not\nvisiting the Madonna. You comprehend the argument: how it all hangs\ntogether?”",
        "“I see. What next?”",
        "“Then you come up, holding one beetle in each hand, and pretend not to\nknow a word of Italian–not a word! You must smile at the doctor, in\nfriendly fashion; he’ll like that. And besides, it will prove what I\nsaid about-----” (touching his forehead once more). “In fact, the truth\nwill be manifest. And there will be no fumigation for us.”",
        "It seemed a needlessly circuitous method of avoiding such a slight\ninconvenience. I would have put more faith in a truthful narrative by\nmyself, suffused with that ingratiating amiability which I would\nperforce employ on such occasions. But the stronger mind, as usual, had\nits way.",
        "“I’ll smile,” I agreed. “But you shall carry my beetles; it looks more\nnatural, somehow. Go ahead, and find them.”",
        "He moved forwards with the beasts and, after destroying a considerable\ntract of stone wall, procured a few specimens of native coleoptera,\nwhich he carefully wrapped up in a piece of paper. I followed slowly.",
        "Unfortunately for him, that particular doctor happened to be\nan americana a snappy little fellow, lately returned from the States.",
        "“Glad to make your acquaintance, sir,” he began, as I came up to where\nthe two were arguing together. “I’ve heard of your passing through the\nother day. So you don’t talk Italian? Well, then, see here: this man of\nyours, this God-dam son of Satan, has been showing me a couple of bugs\nand telling me a couple of hundred lies about them. Better move on right\naway; lucky you struck me! As for this son of a -----, you bet I’ll\nsulphur him, bugs and all, to hell!”",
        "I paid the crestfallen muleteer then and there; took down my bags,\ngreatly lightened, and departed with them. Glancing round near the\nlittle bridge, I saw that the pair were still engaged in heated\ndiscussion, my man clinging despairingly, as it seemed, to the\nbeetle-hypothesis; he looked at me with reproachful eyes, as though I\nhad deserted him in his hour of need.",
        "But what could I do, not knowing Italian?",
        "Moreover, I remembered the “lady-mule.”",
        "Fifteen minutes later a light carriage took me to Castrovillari, whence,\nafter a bath and dinner that compensated for past hardships, I sped down\nto the station and managed, by a miracle, to catch the night-train to\nCosenza.",
        "You may spend pleasant days in this city of Cosenza, doing nothing\nwhatever. But I go there a for set purpose, and bristling with energy. I\ngo there to hunt for a book by a certain Salandra, which was printed on\nthe spot, and which I have not yet been able to find, although I once\ndiscovered it in an old catalogue, priced at 80 grani. Gladly would I\ngive 8000 for it!",
        "The author was a contemporary of that Flying Monk of whom I spoke in\nChapter X, and he belonged to the same religious order. If, in what I\nthen said about the flying monk, there appears to be some trace of light\nfooling in regard to this order and its methods, let amends be made by\nwhat I have to tell about old Salandra, the discovery of whose book is\none of primary importance for the history of English letters. Thus I\nthought at the time; and thus I still think, with all due deference to\ncertain grave and discerning gentlemen, the editors of various English\nmonthlies to whom I submitted a paper on this subject–a paper which\nthey promptly returned with thanks. No; that is not quite correct. One\nof them has kept it; and as six years have passed over our heads, I\npresume he has now acquired a title by “adverse possession.” Much good\nmay it do him!",
        "Had the discovery been mine, I should have endeavoured to hide my light\nunder the proverbial bushel. But it is not mine, and therefore I make\nbold to say that Mr. Bliss Perry, of the “Atlantic Monthly,” knew better\nthan his English colleagues when he published the article from which I\ntake what follows.",
        "“Charles Dunster (’Considerations on Milton’s Early Reading,’ etc.,\n1810) traces the prima stamina of ’Paradise Lost’ to Sylvester’s ’Du\nBartas.’ Masenius, Cedmon, Vendei, and other older writers have also\nbeen named in this connection, while the majority of Milton’s English\ncommentators–and among foreigners Voltaire and Tiraboschi–are inclined\nto regard the ’Adamus Exul’ of Grotius or Andreini’s sacred drama of\n’Adamo’ as the prototype.”",
        "This latter can be consulted in the third volume of Cowper’s ’Milton’\n(1810).",
        "The matter is still unsettled, and in view of the number of recent\nscholars who have interested themselves in it, one is really surprised\nthat no notice has yet been taken of an Italian article which goes far\ntowards deciding this question and proving that the chief source of\n’Paradise Lost’ is the ’Adamo Caduto,’ a sacred tragedy by Serafino\ndella Salandra. The merit of this discovery belongs to Francesco Zicari,\nwhose paper, ’Sulla scoverta dell’ originale italiano da cui Milton\ntrasse il suo poema del paradiso perduto,’ is printed on pages 245\nto 276 in the 1845 volume of the Naples ’Album scientifico-\nartistico-letterario’ now lying before me. It is in the form of\na letter addressed to his friend Francesco Ruffa, a native of\nTropea in Calabria. [Footnote: Zicari contemplated another paper on\nthis subject, but I am unaware whether this was ever published. The\nNeapolitan Minieri-Riccio, who wrote his ’Memorie Storiche’ in 1844,\nspeaks of this article as having been already printed in 1832, but does\nnot say where. This is corroborated by N. Falcone (’Biblioteca\nstorica-topo-grafica della Calabria,’ 2nd ed., Naples, 1846, pp.\n151-154), who gives the same date, and adds that Zicari was the author\nof a work on the district of Fuscaldo. He was born at Paola in Calabria,\nof which he wrote a (manuscript) history, and died in 1846. In this\nMilton article, he speaks of his name being ’unknown in the republic of\nletters.’. He it mentioned by Nicola Leoni (’ Della Magna Grecia,’ vol.\nii, p. 153),]",
        "Salandra, it is true, is named among the writers of sacred tragedies in\nTodd’s ’Milton’ (1809, vol. ii, p. 244), and also by Hayley, but neither\nof them had the curiosity, or the opportunity, to examine his ’Adamo\nCaduto’; Hayley expressly says that he has not seen it. More recent\nworks, such as that of Moers (’De fontibus Paradisi Amissi Miltoniani,’\nBonn, 1860), do not mention Salandra at all. Byse (’Milton on the\nContinent,’ 1903) merely hints at some possible motives for the Allegro\nand the Penseroso.",
        "As to dates, there can be no doubt to whom the priority belongs. The\n’Adamo’ of Salandra was printed at Cosenza in 1647. Richardson thinks\nthat Milton entered upon his ’Paradise Lost’ in 1654, and that it was\nshown, as done, in 1665; D. Masson agrees with this, adding that ’it was\nnot published till two years afterwards.’ The date 1665 is fixed, I\npresume, by the Quaker Elwood’s account of his visit to Milton in the\nautumn of that year, when the poet gave him the manuscript to read; the\ntwo years’ delay in publication may possibly have been due to the\nconfusion occasioned by the great plague and fire of London.",
        "The castigation bestowed upon Lauder by Bishop Douglas, followed, as it\nwas, by a terrific ’back-hander’ from the brawny arm of Samuel Johnson,\ninduces me to say that Salandra’s ’Adamo Caduto,’ though extremely\nrare–so rare that neither the British Museum nor the Paris Bibliotheque\nNationale possesses a copy–is not an imaginary book; I have had it in\nmy hands, and examined it at the Naples Biblioteca Nazionale; it is a\nsmall octavo of 251 pages (not including twenty unnumbered ones, and\nanother one at the end for correction of misprints); badly printed and\nbearing all the marks of genuineness, with the author’s name and the\nyear and place of publication clearly set forth on the title-page. I\nhave carefully compared Zicari’s references to it, and quotations from\nit with the original. They are correct, save for a few insignificant\nverbal discrepancies which, so far as I can judge, betray no indication\nof an attempt on his part to mislead the reader, such as using the word\ntromba (trumpet) instead of Salandra’s term sambuca (sackbut). And\nif further proof of authenticity be required, I may note that the ’Adamo\nCaduto’ of Salandra is already cited in old bibliographies like Toppi’s\n’Biblioteca Napoletana’ (1678), or that of Joannes a S. Antonio\n(’Biblioteca universa Franciscana, etc.,’ Madrid, 1732-1733, vol. iii,\np. 88). It appears to have been the only literary production of its\nauthor, who was a Franciscan monk and is described as ’Preacher, Lector\nand Definitor of the Reformed Province of Basilicata.’",
        "We may take it, then, that Salandra was a real person, who published a\nmystery called ’Adamo Caduto’ in 1647; and I will now, without further\npreamble, extract from Zicari’s article as much as may be sufficient to\nshow ground for his contention that Milton’s ’Paradise Lost’ is a\ntransfusion, in general and in particular, of this same mystery.",
        "Salandra’s central theme is the Universe shattered by the disobedience\nof the First Man, the origin of our unhappiness and sins. The same with\nMilton.",
        "Salandra’s chief personages are God and His angels; the first man and\nwoman; the serpent; Satan and his angels. The same with Milton.",
        "Salandra, at the opening of his poem (the prologue), sets forth his\nargument, and dwells upon the Creative Omnipotence and his works. The\nsame with Milton.",
        "Salandra then describes the council of the rebel angels, their fall from\nheaven into a desert and sulphurous region, their discourses. Man is\nenviously spoken of, and his fall by means of stratagem decided upon; it\nis resolved to reunite in council in Pandemonium or the Abyss, where\nmeasures may be adopted to the end that man may become the enemy of God\nand the prey of hell. The same with Milton.",
        "Salandra personifies Sin and Death, the latter being the child of the\nformer. The same with Milton.",
        "Salandra describes Omnipotence foreseeing the effects of the temptation\nand fall of man, and preparing his redemption. The same with Milton.",
        "Salandra depicts the site of Paradise and the happy life there. The same\nwith Milton.",
        "Salandra sets forth the miraculous creation of the universe and of man,\nand the virtues of the forbidden fruit. The same with Milton.",
        "Salandra reports the conversation between Eve and the Serpent; the\neating of the forbidden fruit and the despair of our first parents. The\nsame with Milton.",
        "Salandra describes the joy of Death at the discomfiture of Eve; the\nrejoicings in hell; the grief of Adam; the flight of our first parents,\ntheir shame and repentance. The same with Milton.",
        "Salandra anticipates the intercession of the Redeemer, and the overthrow\nof Sin and Death; he dwells upon the wonders of the Creation, the murder\nof Abel by his brother Cain, and other human ills; the vices of the\nAntediluvians, due to the fall of Adam; the infernal gift of war. The\nsame with Milton.",
        "Salandra describes the passion of Jesus Christ, and the comforts which\nAdam and Eve receive from the angel who announces the coming of the\nMessiah; lastly, their departure from the earthly paradise. The same\nwith Milton.",
        "So much for the general scheme of both poems. And now for a few\nparticular points of resemblance, verbal and otherwise.",
        "The character of Milton’s Satan, with the various facets of pride, envy,\nvindictiveness, despair, and impenitence which go to form that\nharmonious whole, are already clearly mapped out in the Lucifero of\nSalandra. For this statement, which I find correct, Zicari gives chapter\nand verse, but it would take far too long to set forth the matter in\nthis place. The speeches of Lucifero, to be sure, read rather like a\ncaricature–it must not be forgotten that Salandra was writing for\nlower-class theatrical spectators, and not for refined readers–but the\nelements which Milton has utilized are already there.",
        "Here is a coincidence:",
        "Here we may reign secure . . .",
        "Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.",
        "MILTON (i, 258)",
        ". . . . Qui propria voglia, Son capo, son qui duce, son\nlor Prence.",
        "SALANDRA (p. 49).",
        "And another:",
        "Milton’s Terror is partially taken from the Megera of the Italian poet.\nThe ’grisly Terror’ threatens Satan (ii, 699), and the office of Megera,\nin Salandra’s drama, is exactly the same–that is, to threaten and\nchastise the rebellious spirit, which she does very effectually (pages\n123-131). The identical monsters–Cerberus, Hydras, and Chimseras–are\nfound in their respective abodes, but Salandra does not content himself\nwith these three; his list includes such a mixed assemblage of creatures\nas owls, basilisks, dragons, tigers, bears, crocodiles, sphynxes,\nharpies, and panthers. Terror moves with dread rapidity:",
        "and so does Megera:",
        "Both Milton and Salandra use the names of the gods of antiquity for\ntheir demons, but the narrative epic of the English poet naturally\npermitted of far greater prolixity and variety in this respect. A most\ncurious parallelism exists between Milton’s Belial and that of Salandra.\nBoth are described as luxurious, timorous, slothful, and scoffing, and\nthere is not the slightest doubt that Milton has taken over these mixed\nattributes from the Italian. [Footnote: This is one of the occasions in\nwhich Zicari appears, at first sight, to have stretched a point in order\nto improve his case, because, in the reference he gives, it is Behemoth,\nand not Belial, who speaks of himielf as cowardly (imbelle). But in\nanother place Lucifer applies this designation to Belial as well,]",
        "The words of Milton’s Beelzebub (ii, 368):",
        "are copied from those of the Italian Lucifero (p. 52):",
        "Regarding the creation of the world, Salandra asks (p. 11):",
        "which is thus echoed by Milton (vii, 112):",
        "There is a considerable resemblance between the two poets in their\ndescriptions of Paradise and of its joys. In both poems, too, Adam warns\nhis spouse of her frailty, and in the episode of Eve’s meeting with the\nserpent there are no less than four verbal coincidences. Thus Salandra\nwrites (p. 68):",
        "and Milton transcribes it as follows (ix, 517-554):",
        "Altogether, Zicari has observed that Rolli, although unacquainted with\nthe ’Adamo Caduto,’ has sometimes inadvertently hit upon the same words\nin his Italian translation of Milton which Salandra had used before him.",
        "Eve’s altered complexion after the eating of the forbidden fruit is\nnoted by both poets:",
        "Torbata ne la faccia? Non sei quella",
        "Qual ti lasciai contenta . . .–SALANDRA (p. 89).",
        "Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told;",
        "But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed. –MILTON (ix, 886).",
        "only with this difference, that the Italian Eve adds a half-lie by way\nof explaining the change:",
        "In both poems Sin and Death reappear on the scene after the transgression.",
        "The flight of Innocence from earth; the distempered lust which dominates\nover Adam and Eve after the Fall; the league of Sin and Death to rule\nhenceforward over the world; the pathetic lament of Adam regarding his\nmisfortune and the evils in store for his progeny; his noble sentiment,\nthat none can withdraw himself from the all-seeing eye of God–all these\nare images which Milton has copied from Salandra.",
        "Adam’s state of mind, after the fall, is compared by Salandra to a boat\ntossed by impetuous winds (p. 228):",
        "which is thus paraphrased in Milton (ix, 1122):",
        "Here is a still more palpable adaptation:",
        "After the Fall, according to Salandra, vacillo la terra (i), geme\n(2), e pianse (3), rumoreggiano i tuoni (4), accompagnati da\ngrandini (5), e dense nevi (6), (pp. 138, 142, 218). Milton\ntranslates this as follows: Earth trembled from her entrails (1), and\nnature gave a second groan (2); sky loured and, muttering thunders (4),\nsome sad drops wept (3), the winds, armed with ice and snow (6) and hail\n(5). (’Paradise Lost,’ ix, 1000, x. 697).",
        "Here is another translation:",
        "It is not to my purpose to do Zicari’s work over again, as this would\nentail a complete translation of his long article (it contains nearly\nten thousand words), to which, if the thing is to be done properly, must\nbe appended Salandra’s ’Adamo,’ in order that his quotations from it can\nbe tested. I will therefore refer to the originals those who wish to go\ninto the subject more fully, warning them, en passant, that they may\nfind the task of verification more troublesome than it seems, owing to a\nstupid mistake on Zicari’s part. For in his references to Milton, he\nclaims (p. 252) to use an 1818 Venice translation of the ’Paradise Lost’\nby Rolli. Now Rolli’s ’Paradiso Perduto’ is a well-known work which was\nissued in many editions in London, Paris, and Italy throughout the\neighteenth century. But I cannot trace this particular one of Venice,\nand application to many of the chief libraries of Italy has convinced me\nthat it does not exist, and that 1818 must be a misprint for some other\nyear. The error would be of no significance if Zicari had referred to\nRolli’s ’Paradiso’ by the usual system of cantos and lines, but he\nrefers to it by pages, and the pagination differs in every one of the\neditions of Rolli which have passed through my hands. Despite every\neffort, I have not been able to hit upon the precise one which Zicari\nhad in mind, and if future students are equally unfortunate, I wish them\njoy of their labours. [Footnote: Let me take this opportunity of\nexpressing my best thanks to Baron E. Tortora Brayda, of the Naples\nBiblioteca Nazionale, who has taken an infinity of trouble in this\nmatter.]",
        "These few extracts, however, will suffice to show that, without\nSalandra’s ’Adamo,’ the ’Paradise Lost,’ as we know it, would not be in\nexistence; and that Zicari’s discovery is therefore one of primary\nimportance for English letters, although it would be easy to point out\ndivergencies between the two works–divergencies often due to the\nvarying tastes and feelings of a republican Englishman and an Italian\nCatholic, and to the different conditions imposed by an epic and a\ndramatic poem. Thus, in regard to this last point, Zicari has already\nnoted (p. 270) that Salandra’s scenic acts were necessarily reproduced\nin the form of visions by Milton, who could not avail himself of the\nmechanism of the drama for this purpose. Milton was a man of the world,\ntraveller, scholar, and politician; but it will not do for us to insist\ntoo vehemently upon the probable mental inferiority of the Calabrian\nmonk, in view of the high opinion which Milton seems to have had of his\ntalents. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. The ’Adamo\nCaduto,’ of course, is only one of a series of similar works concerning\nwhich a large literature has now grown up, and it might not be difficult\nto prove that Salandra was indebted to some previous writer for those\nwords and phrases which he passed on to the English poet.",
        "But where did Milton become acquainted with this tragedy? It was at\nNaples, according to Cowper (’Milton,’ vol. iii, p. 206), that the\nEnglish poet may first have entertained the idea of ’the loss of\nparadise as a subject peculiarly fit for poetry.’ He may well have\ndiscussed sacred tragedies, like those of Andreini, with the Marquis\nManso. But Milton had returned to England long before Salandra’s poem\nwas printed; nor can Manso have sent him a copy of it, for he died in\n1645–two years before its publication–and Zicari is thus mistaken in\nassuming (p. 245) that Milton became acquainted with it in the house of\nthe Neapolitan nobleman. Unless, therefore, we take for granted that\nManso was intimate with the author Salandra–he knew most of his\nliterary countrymen–and sent or gave to Milton a copy of the manuscript\nof ’Adamo’ before it was printed, or that Milton was personally\nfamiliar with Salandra, we may conclude that the poem was forwarded to\nhim from Italy by some other friend, perhaps by some member of the\nAccademia, degli Oziosi which Manso had founded.",
        "A chance therefore seems to have decided Milton; Salandra’s tragedy fell\ninto his hands, and was welded into the epic form which he had designed\nfor Arthur the Great, even as, in later years, a chance question on the\npart of Elwood led to his writing ’Paradise Regained.’ [Footnote: Thou\nhast said much of Paradise Lost, but what hast thou to say of Paradise\nFound? He made no answer, but sat some time in a muse. . . .]",
        "For this poem there were not so many models handy as for the other, but\nMilton has written too little to enable us to decide how far its\ninferiority to the earlier epic is due to this fact, and how far to the\ninherent inertia of its subject-matter. Little movement can be contrived\nin a mere dialogue such as ’Paradise Regained ’; it lacks the grandiose\nmise-en-scene and the shifting splendours of the greater epic; the\nstupendous figure of the rebellious archangel, the true hero of\n’Paradise Lost,’ is here dwarfed into a puny, malignant sophist; nor is\nthe final issue in the later poem even for a moment in doubt–a\nserious defect from an artistic point of view. Jortin holds its peculiar\nexcellence to be ’artful sophistry, false reasoning, set off in the most\nspecious manner, and refuted by the Son of God with strong unaffected\neloquence’; merits for which Milton needed no original of any kind, as\nhis own lofty religious sentiments, his argumentative talents and long\nexperience of political pamphleteering, stood him in good stead. Most of\nus must have wondered how it came about that Milton could not endure to\nhear ’Paradise Lost’ preferred to ’Paradise Regained,’ in view of the\nvery apparent inferiority of the latter. If we had known what Milton\nknew, namely, to how large an extent ’Paradise Lost’ was not the child\nof his own imagination, and therefore not so precious in his eyes as\n’Paradise Regained,’ we might have understood his prejudice.",
        "Certain parts of ’Paradise Lost’ are drawn, as we all know, from other\nItalian sources, from Sannazario, Ariosto, Guarini, Bojardo, and others.\nZicari who, it must be said, has made the best of his case, will have it\nthat the musterings and battles of the good and evil angels are copied\nfrom the ’Angeleide’ of Valvasone published at Milan in 1590. But G.\nPolidori, who has reprinted the ’Angeleide’ in his Italian version of\nMilton (London, 1840), has gone into this matter and thinks otherwise.\nThese devil-and-angel combats were a popular theme at the time, and\nthere is no reason why the English poet should copy continental writers\nin such descriptions, which necessarily have a common resemblance. The\nMarquis Manso was very friendly with the poets Tasso and Marino, and it\nis also to be remarked that entire passages in ’Paradise Lost’ are\ncopied, totidem verbis, from the writings of these two, Manso having\nno doubt drawn Milton’s attention to their beauties. In fact, I am\ninclined to think that Manso’s notorious enthusiasm for the warlike\nepic of Tasso may first of all have diverted Milton from purely pastoral\nideals and inflamed him with the desire of accomplishing a similar feat,\nwhence the well-known lines in Milton’s Latin verses to this friend,\nwhich contain the first indication of such a design on his part. Even\nthe familiar invocation, ’Hail, wedded Love,’ is bodily drawn from one\nof Tasso’s letters (see Newton’s ’Milton,’ 1773, vol. i, pp. 312, 313).",
        "It has been customary to speak of these literary appropriations as\n’imitations ’; but whoever compares them with the originals will find\nthat many of them are more correctly termed translations. The case, from\na literary-moral point of view, is different as regards ancient writers,\nand it is surely idle to accuse Milton, as has been done, of pilferings\nfrom Aeschylus or Ovid. There is no such thing as robbing the classics.\nThey are our literary fathers, and what they have left behind them is\nour common heritage; we may adapt, borrow, or steal from them as much as\nwill suit our purpose; to acknowledge such ’thefts’ is sheer pedantry\nand ostentation. But Salandra and the rest of them were Milton’s\ncontemporaries. It is certainly an astonishing fact that no scholar of\nthe stamp of Thyer was acquainted with the ’Adamo Caduto’; and it says\nmuch for the isolation of England that, at a period when poems on the\nsubject of paradise lost were being scattered broadcast in Italy and\nelsewhere–when, in short, all Europe was ringing with the doleful\nhistory of Adam and Eve–Milton could have ventured to speak of\nhis work as ’Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyma’–an amazing\nverse which, by the way, is literally transcribed out of Ariosto\n(’Cosa, non detta in prosa mai, ne in rima’). But even now the\nacquaintance of the British public with the productions of continental\nwriters is superficial and spasmodic, and such was the ignorance of\nEnglish scholars of this earlier period, that Birch maintained that\nMilton’s drafts, to be referred to presently, indicated his intention of\nwriting an opera (!); while as late as 1776 the poet Mickle,\nnotwithstanding Voltaire’s authority, questioned the very existence of\nAndreini, who has written thirty different pieces.",
        "Some idea of the time when Salandra’s tragedy reached Milton might be\ngained if we knew the date of his manuscript projects for ’Paradise\nLost’ and other writings which are preserved at Cambridge. R. Garnett\n(’Life of Milton,’ 1890, p. 129) supposes these drafts to date from\nabout 1640 to 1642, and I am not sufficiently learned in Miltonian lore\nto controvert or corroborate in a general way this assertion. But the\ndate must presumably be pushed further forward in the case of the\nskeletons for ’Paradise Lost,’ which are modelled to a great extent upon\nSalandra’s ’Adamo’ of 1647, though other compositions may also have been\npresent before Milton’s mind, such as that mentioned on page 234 of the\nsecond volume of Todd’s ’Milton,’ from which he seems to have drawn the\nhint of a ’prologue spoken by Moses.’",
        "Without going into the matter exhaustively, I will only say that from\nthese pieces it is clear that Milton’s primary idea was to write, like\nSalandra, a sacred tragedy upon this theme, and not an epic. These\ndrafts also contain a chorus, such as Salandra has placed in his drama,\nand a great number of mutes, who do not figure in the English epic, but\nwho reappear in the ’Adamo Caduto’ and all similar works. Even Satan is\nhere designated as Lucifer, in accordance with the Italian Lucifero; and\nat the end of one of Milton’s drafts we read ’at last appears Mercy,\ncomforts him, promises the Messiah, etc.,’ which is exactly what\nSalandra’s Misericordia (Mercy) does in the same place.",
        "Milton no doubt kept on hand many loose passages of poetry, both\noriginal and borrowed, ready to be worked up into larger pieces; all\npoets are smothered in odd scraps of verse and lore which they ’fit in’\nas occasion requires; and it is therefore quite possible that some\nfragments now included in ’Paradise Lost’ may have been complete before\nthe ’Adamo Caduto’ was printed. I am referring, more especially, to\nSatan’s address to the sun, which Philips says was written before the\ncommencement of the epic.",
        "Admitting Philips to be correct, I still question whether this\ninvocation was composed before Milton’s visit to Naples; and if it was,\nthe poet may well have intended it for some other of the multitudinous\nworks which these drafts show him to have been revolving in his mind, or\nfor none of them in particular.",
        "De Quincey rightly says that Addison gave the initial bias in favour of\n’Paradise Lost’ to the English national mind, which has thenceforward\nshrunk, as Addison himself did, from a dispassionate contemplation of\nits defects; the idea being, I presume, that a ’divine poem’ in a manner\ndisarmed rational criticism. And, strange to say, even the few faults\nwhich earlier scholars did venture to point out in Milton’s poem will be\nfound in that of Salandra. There is the same superabundance of allegory;\nthe same confusion of spirit and matter among the supernatural persons;\nthe same lengthy astronomical treatise; the same personification of Sin\nand Death; the same medley of Christian and pagan mythology; the same\ntedious historico-theological disquisition at the end of both poems.",
        "For the rest, it is to be hoped that we have outgrown our fastidiousness\non some of these points. Theological fervour has abated, and in a work\nof the pure imagination, as ’Paradise Lost’ is now–is it\nnot?–considered to be, there is nothing incongruous or offensive in an\namiable commingling of Semitic and Hellenic deities after the approved\nItalian recipe; nor do a few long words about geography or science\ndisquiet us any more. Milton was not writing for an uncivilized mob, and\nhis occasional displays of erudition will represent to a cultured person\nonly those breathing spaces so refreshing in all epic poetry. That\nMilton’s language is saturated with Latinisms and Italianisms is\nperfectly true. His English may not have been good enough for his\ncontemporaries. But it is quite good enough for us. That ’grand manner’\nwhich Matthew Arnold claimed for Milton, that sustained pitch of kingly\nelaboration and fullness, is not wholly an affair of high moral tone; it\nresults in part from the humbler ministrations of words happily\nchosen–from a felicitous alloy of Mediterranean grace and Saxon mettle.\nFor, whether consciously or not, we cannot but be influenced by the\ncolour-effects of mere words, that arouse in us definite but\nindefinable moods of mind. To complain of the foreign phraseology and\nturns of thought in ’Paradise Lost’ would be the blackest ingratitude\nnowadays, seeing that our language has become enriched by steady gleams\nof pomp and splendour due, in large part, to the peculiar lustre of\nMilton’s comely importations.",
        "It was to be the Sila in earnest, this time. I would traverse the whole\ncountry, from the Coscile valley to Catanzaro, at the other end.\nArriving from Cosenza the train deposited me, once more, at the unlovely\nstation of Castrovillari. I looked around the dusty square, half-dazed\nby the sunlight–it was a glittering noonday in July–but the postal\nwaggon to Spezzano Albanese, my first resting-point, had not yet\narrived. Then a withered old man, sitting on a vehicle behind the sorry\nskeleton of a horse, volunteered to take me there at once; we quickly\ncame to terms; it was too hot, we both agreed, to waste breath in\nbargaining. With the end of his whip he pointed out the church of\nSpezzano on its hilltop; a proud structure it looked at this distance,\nthough nearer acquaintance reduced it to extremely humble proportions.",
        "The Albanian Spezzano (Spezzano Grande is another place) lies on the\nmain road from Castrovillari to Cosenza, on the summit of a\nlong-stretched tongue of limestone which separates the Crati river from\nthe Esaro; this latter, after flowing into the Coscile, joins its waters\nwith the Crati, and so closes the promontory. An odd geographical\nfeature, this low stretch, viewed from the greater heights of Sila or\nPollino; one feels inclined to take a broom and sweep it into the sea,\nso that the waters may mingle sooner.",
        "Our road ascended the thousand feet in a sinuous ribbon of white dust,\nand an eternity seemed to pass as we crawled drowsily upwards to the\nmusic of the cicadas, under the simmering blue sky. There was not a soul\nin sight; a hush had fallen upon all things; great Pan was brooding over\nthe earth. At last we entered the village, and here, once more,\ndeathlike stillness reigned; it was the hour of post-prandial slumber.",
        "At our knocking the proprietor of the inn, situated in a side-street,\ndescended. But he was in bad humour, and held out no hopes of\nrefreshment. Certain doctors and government officials, he said, were\ngathered together in his house, telegraphically summoned to consult\nabout a local case of cholera. As to edibles, the gentlemen had lunched,\nand nothing was left, absolutely nothing; it had been uno\nsterminio–an extermination–of all he possessed. The prospect of\nwalking about the burning streets till evening did not appeal to me, and\nas this was the only inn at Spezzano I insisted, first gently, then\nforcibly–in vain. There was not so much as a chair to sit upon, he\navowed; and therewith retired into his cool twilight.",
        "Despairing, I entered a small shop wherein I had observed the only signs\nof life so far–an Albanian woman spinning in patriarchal fashion. It\nwas a low-ceilinged room, stocked with candles, seeds, and other\ncommodities which a humble householder might desire to purchase,\nincluding certain of those water-gugglets of Corigliano ware in whose\nshapely contours something of the artistic dreamings of old Sybaris\nstill seems to linger. The proprietress, clothed in gaudily picturesque\ncostume, greeted me with a smile and the easy familiarity which I have\nsince discovered to be natural to all these women. She had a room, she\nsaid, where I could rest; there was also food, such as it was, cheese,\nand wine, and-----",
        "“Fruit?” I queried.",
        "“Ah, you like fruit? Well, we may not so much as speak about it just\nnow–the cholera, the doctors, the policeman, the prison! I was going to\nsay salami.”",
        "Salami? I thanked her. I know Calabrian pigs and what they feed on,\nthough it would be hard to describe in the language of polite society.",
        "Despite the heat and the swarms of flies in that chamber, I felt little\ndesire for repose after her simple repast; the dame was so affable and\nentertaining that we soon became great friends. I caused her some\namusement by my efforts to understand and pronounce her language–these\nfolk speak Albanian and Italian with equal facility–which seemed to my\nunpractised ears as hopeless as Finnish. Very patiently, she gave me a\nlong lesson during which I thought to pick up a few words and phrases,\nbut the upshot of it all was:",
        "“You’ll never learn it. You have begun a hundred years too late.”",
        "I tried her with modern Greek, but among such fragments as remained on\nmy tongue after a lapse of over twenty years, only hit upon one word\nthat she could understand.",
        "“Quite right!” she said encouragingly. “Why don’t you always speak\nproperly? And now, let me hear a little of your own language.”",
        "I gave utterance to a few verses of Shakespeare, which caused\nconsiderable merriment.",
        "“Do you mean to tell me,” she asked, “that people really talk like that?”",
        "“Of course they do.”",
        "“And pretend to understand what it means?”",
        "“Why, naturally.”",
        "“Maybe they do,” she agreed. “But only when they want to be thought\nfunny by their friends.”",
        "The afternoon drew on apace, and at last the pitiless sun sank to rest.\nI perambulated Spezzano in the gathering twilight; it was now fairly\nalive with people. An unclean place; an epidemic of cholera would work\nwonders here. . . .",
        "At 9.30 p.m. the venerable coachman presented himself, by appointment;\nhe was to drive me slowly (out of respect for his horse) through the\ncool hours of the night as far as Vaccarizza, on the slopes of the Greek\nSila, where he expected to arrive early in the morning. (And so he did;\nat half-past five.) Not without more mirth was my leave-taking from the\ngood shopwoman; something, apparently, was hopelessly wrong with the\nAlbanian words of farewell which I had carefully memorized from our\npreceding lesson. She then pressed a paper parcel into my hand.",
        "“For the love of God,” she whispered, “silence! Or we shall all be in\njail to-morrow.”",
        "It contained a dozen pears.",
        "Driving along, I tried to enter into conversation with the coachman who,\njudging by his face, was a mine of local lore. But I had come too late;\nthe poor old man was so weakened by age and infirmities that he cared\nlittle for talk, his thoughts dwelling, as I charitably imagined, on his\nwife and children, all dead and buried (so he said) many long years ago.\nHe mentioned, however, the diluvio, the deluge, which I have heard\nspoken of by older people, among whom it is a fixed article of faith.\nThis deluge is supposed to have affected the whole Crati valley,\nsubmerging towns and villages. In proof, they say that if you dig near\nTarsia below the present river-level, you will pass through beds of silt\nand ooze to traces of old walls and cultivated land. Tarsia used to lie\nby the river-side, and was a flourishing place, according to the\ndescriptions of Leandro Alberti and other early writers; floods and\nmalaria have now forced it to climb the hills.",
        "The current of the Crati is more spasmodic and destructive than in\nclassical times when the river was “navigable\"; and to one of its\ninundations may be due this legend of the deluge; to the same\none, maybe, that affected the courses of this river and the Coscile,\nmingling their waters which used to flow separately into the Ionian. Or\nit may be a hazy memory of the artificial changing of the riverbed when\nthe town of Sybaris, lying between these two rivers, was destroyed. Yet\nthe streams are depicted as entering the sea apart in old maps such as\nthose of Magini, Fiore, Coronelli, and Cluver; and the latter writes\nthat “near the mouth of the Crati there flows into the same sea a river\nvulgarly called Cochile.” [Footnote: In the earlier part of\nRathgeber’s astonishing “Grossgriechenland und Pythagoras” (1866) will\nbe found a good list of old maps of the country.]",
        "This is important. It remains to be seen whether this statement is the\nresult of a personal visit, or whether he simply repeated the old\ngeography. His text in many places indicates a personal acquaintance\nwith southern Italy–Italian, says Heinsius, non semel\nperagravit– and he may well have been tempted to investigate a site\nlike that of Sybaris. If so, the change in the river courses and\npossibly this “deluge” has taken place since his day.",
        "Deprived of converse, I relapsed into a doze, but soon woke up with a\nstart. The carriage had stopped; it was nearly midnight; we were at\nTerranova di Sibari, whose houses were lit up by the silvery beams of\nthe moon.",
        "Thurii–death-place of Herodotus! How one would like to see this place\nby daylight. On the ancient site, which lies at a considerable distance,\nthey have excavated antiquities, a large number of which are in the\npossession of the Marchese Galli at Castrovillari. I endeavoured to see\nhis museum, but found it inaccessible for “family reasons.” The same\nanswer was given me in regard to a valuable private library at Rossano,\nand annoying as it may be, one cannot severely blame such local\ngentlemen for keeping their collections to themselves. What have they to\ngain from the visits of inquisitive travellers?",
        "During these meditations on my part, the old man hobbled busily to and\nfro with a bucket, bearing water from a fountain near at hand wherewith\nto splash the carriage-wheels. He persisted in this singular occupation\nfor an unreasonably long time. Water was good for the wheels, he\nexplained; it kept them cool.",
        "At last we started, and I began to slumber once more. The carriage\nseemed to be going down a steep incline; endlessly it descended, with a\npleasant swaying motion. . . . Then an icy shiver roused me from my\ndreams. It was the Crati whose rapid waves, fraught with unhealthy\nchills, rippled brightly in the moonlight. We crossed the malarious\nvalley, and once more touched the hills.",
        "From those treeless slopes there streamed forth deliciously warm\nemanations stored up during the scorching hours of noon; the short scrub\nthat clothed them was redolent of that peculiar Calabrian odour which\nhaunts one like a melody–an odour of dried cistus and other aromatic\nplants, balsamic by day, almost overpowering at this hour. To aid and\ndiversify the symphony of perfume, I lit a cigar, and then gave myself\nup to contemplation of the heavenly bodies. We passed a solitary man,\nwalking swiftly with bowed head. What was he doing there?",
        "“Lupomanaro,” said the driver.",
        "A werewolf. . . .",
        "I had always hoped to meet with a werewolf on his nocturnal rambles, and\nnow my wish was gratified. But it was disappointing to see him in human\ngarb–even werewolves, it seems, must march with the times. This\nenigmatical growth of the human mind flourishes in Calabria, but is not\npopular as a subject of conversation. The more old-fashioned werewolves\ncling to the true versipellis habits, and in that case only the pigs,\nthe inane Calabrian pigs, are dowered with the faculty of distinguishing\nthem in daytime, when they look like any other “Christian.” There is a\nrecord, in Fiore’s book, of an epidemic of lycanthropy that attacked the\nboys of Cassano. (Why only the boys?) It began on 31 July, 1210; and the\nseason of the year strikes me as significant.",
        "After that I fell asleep in good earnest, nor did I wake up again till\nthe sun was peering over the eastern hills. We were climbing up a long\nslope; the Albanian settlements of Vaccarizza and San Giorgio lay before\nus and, looking back, I still saw Spezzano on its ridge; it seemed so\nclose that a gunshot could have reached it.",
        "These non-Italian villages date from the centuries that followed the\ndeath of Scanderbeg, when the Grand Signior consolidated his power. The\nrefugees arrived in flocks from over the sea, and were granted tracts of\nwild land whereon to settle–some of them on this incline of the Sila,\nwhich was accordingly called “Greek” Sila, the native confusing these\nforeigners with the Byzantines whose dwellings, as regards Calabria, are\nnow almost exclusively confined to the distant region of Aspromonte.\nColonies of Albanians are scattered all over South Italy, chiefly in\nApulia, Calabria, Basilicata, and Sicily; a few are in the north and\ncentre–there is one on the Po, for instance, now reduced to 200\ninhabitants; most of these latter have become absorbed into the\nsurrounding Italian element. Angelo Masci (reprinted 1846) says there\nare 59 villages of them, containing altogether 83,000 inhabitants–\nexclusive of Sicily; Morelli (1842) gives their total population\nfor Italy and Sicily as 103,466. If these figures are correct,\nthe race must have multiplied latterly, for I am told there are\nnow some 200,000 Albanians in the kingdom, living in about 80 villages.\nThis gives approximately 2500 for each settlement–a likely number, if\nit includes those who are at present emigrants in America. There is a\nvoluminous literature on the subject of these strangers, the authors of\nwhich are nearly all Albanians themselves. The fullest account of older\nconditions may well be that contained in the third volume of Rodota’s\nlearned work (1758); the ponderous Francesco Tajani (1886) brings\naffairs up to date, or nearly so. If only he had provided his book with\nan index!",
        "There were troubles at first. Arriving, as they did, solely “with their\nshirts and rhapsodies” (so one of them described it to me)–that is,\ndespoiled of everything, they indulged in robberies and depredations\nsomewhat too freely even for those free days, with the result that\nferocious edicts were issued against them, and whole clans wiped out. It\nwas a case of necessity knowing no law. But in proportion as the forests\nwere hewn down and crops sown, they became as respectable as their\nhosts. They are bilingual from birth, one might almost say, and numbers\nof the men also express themselves correctly in English, which they pick\nup in the United States.",
        "These islands of alien culture have been hotbeds of Liberalism\nthroughout history. The Bourbons persecuted them savagely on that\naccount, exiling and hanging the people by scores. At this moment there\nis a good deal of excitement going on in favour of the Albanian revolt\nbeyond the Adriatic, and it was proposed, among other things, to\norganize a demonstration in Rome, where certain Roman ladies were to\ndress themselves in Albanian costumes and thus work upon the sentiments\nof the nation; but “the authorities” forbade this and every other\nmovement. None the less, there has been a good deal of clandestine\nrecruiting, and bitter recriminations against this turcophile attitude\non the part of Italy–this “reactionary rigorism against every\nmanifestation of sympathy for the Albanian cause.” Patriotic\npamphleteers ask, rightly enough, why difficulties should be placed in\nthe way of recruiting for Albania, when, in the recent cases of Cuba and\nGreece, the despatch of volunteers was actually encouraged by the\ngovernment? “Legality has ceased to exist here; we Albanians are watched\nand suspected exactly as our compatriots now are by the Turks. . . .\nThey sequestrate our manifestos, they forbid meetings and conferences,\nthey pry into our postal correspondence. . . . Civil and military\nauthorities have conspired to prevent a single voice of help and comfort\nreaching our brothers, who call to us from over the sea.” A hard case,\nindeed. But Vienna and Cettinje might be able to throw some light upon\nit. [Footnote: This was written before the outbreak of the Balkan war.]",
        "The Albanian women, here as elsewhere, are the veriest beasts of burden;\nunlike the Italians, they carry everything (babies, and wood, and water)\non their backs. Their crudely tinted costumes would be called more\nstrange than beautiful under any but a bright sunshiny sky. The fine\nnative dresses of the men have disappeared long ago; they even adopted,\nin days past, the high-peaked Calabrian hat which is now only worn by\nthe older generation. Genuine Calabrians often settle in these foreign\nvillages, in order to profit by their anti-feudal institutions. For even\nnow the Italian cultivator is supposed to make, and actually does make,\n\"voluntary” presents to his landlord at certain seasons; gifts which are\nalways a source of irritation and, in bad years, a real hardship. The\nAlbanians opposed themselves from the very beginning against these\nmediaeval practices. “They do not build houses,” says an old writer, “so\nas not to be subject to barons, dukes, princes, or other lords. And if\nthe owner of the land they inhabit ill-treats them, they set fire to\ntheir huts and go elsewhere.” An admirable system, even nowadays.",
        "One would like to be here at Easter time to see the rusalet–those\nPyrrhic dances where the young men group themselves in martial array,\nand pass through the streets with song and chorus, since, soon enough,\nAmerica will have put an end to such customs. The old Albanian guitar of\nnine strings has already died out, and the double tibia–biforem dat\ntibia cantum–will presently follow suit. This instrument, familiar\nfrom classical sculpture and lore, and still used in Sicily and\nSardinia, was once a favourite with the Sila shepherds, who called it\n\"fischietto a pariglia.” But some years ago I vainly sought it in the\ncentral Sila; the answer to my enquiries was everywhere the same: they\nknew it quite well; so and so used to play it; certain persons in\ncertain villages still made it–they described it accurately enough, but\ncould not produce a specimen. Single pipes, yes; and bagpipes galore;\nbut the tibia: pares were “out of fashion” wherever I asked for them.",
        "Here, in the Greek Sila, I was more fortunate. A boy at the village of\nMacchia possessed a pair which he obligingly gave me, after first\nplaying a song–a farewell song–a plaintive ditty that required, none\nthe less, an excellent pair of lungs, on account of the two mouthpieces.\nMelodies on this double flageolet are played principally at Christmas\ntime. The two reeds are about twenty-five centimetres in length, and\nmade of hollow cane; in my specimen, the left hand controls four, the\nother six holes; the Albanian name of the instrument is “fiscarol.”",
        "From a gentleman at Vaccarizza I received a still more valuable\npresent–two neolithic celts (aenolithic, I should be inclined to call\nthem) wrought in close-grained quartzite, and found not far from that\nvillage. These implements must be rare in the uplands of Calabria, as I\nhave never come across them before, though they have been found, to my\nknowledge, at Savelli in the central Sila. At Vaccarizza they call such\nrelics “pic\"–they are supposed, as usual, to be thunderbolts, and I am\nalso told that a piece of string tied to one of them cannot be burnt in\nfire. The experiment might be worth trying.",
        "Meanwhile, the day passed pleasantly at Vaccarizza. I became the guest\nof a prosperous resident, and was treated to genuine Albanian\nhospitality and excellent cheer. I only wish that all his compatriots\nmight enjoy one meal of this kind in their lifetime. For they are poor,\nand their homes of miserable aspect. Like all too many villages in South\nItaly, this one is depopulated of its male inhabitants, and otherwise\ndirty and neglected. The impression one gains on first seeing one of\nthese places is more than that of Oriental decay; they are not merely\nragged at the edges. It is a deliberate and sinister chaos, a note of\ndownright anarchy–a contempt for those simple forms of refinement which\neven the poorest can afford. Such persons, one thinks, cannot have much\nsense of home and its hallowed associations; they seem to be\neverlastingly ready to break with the existing state of things. How\ndifferent from England, where the humblest cottages, the roadways, the\nvery stones testify to immemorial love of order, to neighbourly feelings\nand usages sanctioned by time!",
        "They lack the sense of home as a fixed and old-established topographical\npoint; as do the Arabs and Russians, neither of whom have a word\nexpressing our “home” or “Heimat.” Here, the nearest equivalent is la\nfamiglia. We think of a particular house or village where we were born\nand where we spent our impressionable days of childhood; these others\nregard home not as a geographical but as a social centre, liable to\nshift from place to place; they are at home everywhere, so long as their\nclan is about them. That acquisitive sense which affectionately adorns\nour meanest dwelling, slowly saturating it with memories, has been\ncrushed out of them–if it ever existed–by hard blows of fortune; it is\nsafer, they think, to transform the labour of their hands into gold,\nwhich can be moved from place to place or hidden from the tyrant’s eye.\nThey have none of our sentimentality in regard to inanimate objects.\nEliza Cook’s feelings towards her “old arm-chair” would strike them as\nsavouring of childishness. Hence the unfinished look of their houses,\nwithin and without. Why expend thought and wealth upon that which may be\nabandoned to-morrow?",
        "The two churches of Vaccarizza, dark and unclean structures, stand side\nby side, and I was shown through them by their respective priests, Greek\nand Catholic, who walked arm in arm in friendly wise, and meekly smiled\nat a running fire of sarcastic observations on the part of another\ncitizen directed against the “bottega” in general–the shop, as the\nchurch is sometimes irreverently called. The Greco-Catholic cult to\nwhich these Albanians belong is a compromise between the Orthodox and\nRoman; their priests may wear beards and marry wives, they use bread\ninstead of the wafer for sacramental purposes, and there are one or two\nother little differences of grave import.",
        "Six Albanian settlements lie on these northern slopes of the Sila–San\nGiorgio, Vaccarizza, San Cosimo, Macchia, San Demetrio Corone, and Santa\nSofia d’ Epiro. San Demetrio is the largest of them, and thither, after\nan undisturbed night’s rest at the house of my kind host–the last, I\nfear, for many days to come–I drove in the sunlit hours of next\nmorning. Along the road one can see how thoroughly the Albanians have\ndone their work; the land is all under cultivation, save for a dark belt\nof trees overhead, to remind one of what once it was. Perhaps they have\neradicated the forest over-zealously, for I observe in San Demetrio that\nthe best drinking water has now to be fetched from a spring at a\nconsiderable distance from the village; it is unlikely that this should\nhave been the original condition of affairs; deforestation has probably\ndiminished the water-supply.",
        "It was exhilarating to traverse these middle heights with their aerial\nviews over the Ionian and down olive-covered hill-sides towards the wide\nvalley of the Crati and the lofty Pollino range, now swimming in\nmidsummer haze. The road winds in and out of gullies where rivulets\ndescend from the mountains; they are clothed in cork-oak, ilex, and\nother trees; golden orioles, jays, hoopoes and rollers flash among the\nfoliage. In winter these hills are swept by boreal blasts from the\nApennines, but at this season it is a delightful tract of land.",
        "San Demetrio, famous for its Italo-Albanian College, lies on a fertile\nincline sprinkled with olives and mulberries and chestnuts, fifteen\nhundred feet above sea-level. They tell me that within the memory of\nliving man no Englishman has ever entered the town. This is quite\npossible; I have not yet encountered a single English traveller, during\nmy frequent wanderings over South Italy. Gone are the days of Keppel\nCraven and Swinburne, of Eustace and Brydone and Hoare! You will come\nacross sporadic Germans immersed in Hohenstaufen records, or searching\nafter Roman antiquities, butterflies, minerals, or landscapes to\npaint–you will meet them in the most unexpected places; but never an\nEnglishman. The adventurous type of Anglo-Saxon probably thinks the\ncountry too tame; scholars, too trite; ordinary tourists, too dirty. The\naccommodation and food in San Demetrio leave much to be desired; its\nstreets are irregular lanes, ill-paved with cobbles of gneiss and\nsmothered under dust and refuse. None the less, what noble names have\nbeen given to these alleys–names calculated to fire the ardent\nimagination of young Albanian students, and prompt them to valorous and\npatriotic deeds! Here are the streets of “Odysseus,” of “Salamis” and\n\"Marathon” and “Thermopylae,” telling of the glory that was Greece; “Via\nSkanderbeg” and “Hypsilanti” awaken memories of more immediate renown;\n\"Corso Dante Alighieri” reminds them that their Italian hosts, too, have\ndone something in their day; the “Piazza Francesco Ferrer” causes their\nultra-liberal breasts to swell with mingled pride and indignation; while\nthe “Via dell’ Industria” hints, not obscurely, at the great truth that\ngenius, without a capacity for taking pains, is an idle phrase. Such\nappellations, without a doubt, are stimulating and glamorous. But if the\nstreets themselves have seen a scavenger’s broom within the last\nhalf-century, I am much mistaken. The goddess “Hygeia” dost not figure\namong their names, nor yet that Byzantine Monarch whose infantile\nexploit might be re-enacted in ripest maturity without attracting any\nattention in San Demetrio. To the pure all things are pure.",
        "The town is exclusively Albanian; the Roman Catholic church has fallen\ninto disrepair, and is now used as a shed for timber. But at the door of\nthe Albanian sanctuary I was fortunate enough to intercept a native\nwedding, just as the procession was about to enter the portal. Despite\nthe fact that the bride was considered the ugliest girl in the place,\nshe had been duly “robbed” by her bold or possibly blind lover–her\nfeatures were providentially veiled beneath her nuptial flammeum, and\nof her squat figure little could be discerned under the gorgeous\naccoutrements of the occasion. She was ablaze with ornaments and\nembroidery of gold, on neck and shoulders and wrist; a wide lace collar\nfell over a bodice of purple silk; silken too, and of brightest green,\nwas her pleated skirt. The priest seemed ineffably bored with his task,\nand mumbled through one or two pages of holy books in record time; there\nwere holdings of candles, interchange of rings, sacraments of bread and\nwine and other solemn ceremonies–the most quaint being the\nstephanoma, or crowning, of the happy pair, and the moving of their\nrespective crowns from the head of one to that of the other. It ended\nwith a chanting perlustration of the church, led by the priest: this is\nthe so-called “pesatura.”",
        "I endeavoured to attune my mind to the gravity of this marriage, to the\ndeep historico-ethnologico-poetical significance of its smallest detail.\nSuch rites, I said to myself, must be understood to be appreciated, and\nhad I not been reading certain native commentators on the subject that\nvery morning? Nevertheless, my attention was diverted from the main\nissue–the bridegroom’s face had fascinated me. The self-conscious male\nis always at a disadvantage during grotesquely splendid buffooneries of\nthis kind; and never, in all my life, have I seen a man looking such a\nsorry fool as this individual, never; especially during the\nperambulation, when his absurd crown was supported on his head, from\nbehind, by the hand of his best man.",
        "Meanwhile a handful of boys, who seemed to share my private feelings in\nregard to the performance, had entered the sacred precincts, their\npockets stuffed with living cicadas. These Albanian youngsters, like all\ntrue connaisseurs, are aware of the idiosyncrasy of the classical insect\nwhich, when pinched or tickled on a certain spot, emits its\ncharacteristic and ear-piercing note–the “lily-soft voice” of the Greek\nbard. The cicadas, therefore, were duly pinched and then let loose; like\nsquibs and rockets they careered among the congregation, dashing in our\nfaces and clinging to our garments; the church resounded like an\nolive-copse at noon. A hot little hand conveyed one of these tremulously\nthrobbing creatures into my own, and obeying a whispered injunction of\n\"Let it fly, sir!” I had the joy of seeing the beast alight with a\nviolent buzz on the head of the bride–doubtless the happiest of\nauguries. Such conduct, on the part of English boys, would be deemed\nvery naughty and almost irreverent; but here, one hopes, it may have its\norigin in some obscure but pious credence such as that which prompts the\npopulace to liberate birds in churches, at Easter time. These escaping\ncicadas, it may be, are symbolical of matrimony–the individual man and\nwoman freed, at last, from the dungeon-like horrors of celibate\nexistence; or, if that parallel be far-fetched, we may conjecture that\ntheir liberation represents the afflatus of the human soul, aspiring\nupwards to merge its essence into the Divine All. . . .",
        "The pride of San Demetrio is its college. You may read about it in\nProfessor Mazziotti’s monograph; but whoever wishes to go to the\nfountain-head must peruse the Historia Erectionis Pontifici Collegi\nCorsini Ullanensis, etc., of old Zavarroni–an all-too-solid piece of\nwork. Founded under the auspices of Pope Clement XII in 1733 (or 1735)\nat San Benedetto Ullano, it was moved hither in 1794, and between that\ntime and now has passed through fierce vicissitudes. Its president,\nBishop Bugliari, was murdered by the brigands in 1806; much of its lands\nand revenues have been dissipated by maladministration; it was\npersecuted for its Liberalism by the Bourbons, who called it a “workshop\nof the devil.” It distinguished itself during the anti-dynastic revolts\nof 1799 and 1848 and, in 1860, was presented with twelve thousand ducats\nby Garibaldi, “in consideration of the signal services rendered to the\nnational cause by the brave and generous Albanians.” [Footnote: There\nused to be regiments of these Albanians at Naples. In Filati de\nTassulo’s sane study (1777) they are spoken of as highly prized.] Even\nnow the institution is honeycombed with Freemasonry–the surest path to\nadvancement in any career, in modern Italy. Times indeed have changed\nsince the “Inviolable Constitutions” laid it down that nullus omnino\nAlumnus in Collegio detineatur, cuius futura; Chris-tianae pietatis\nsignificatio non extet. But only since 1900 has it been placed on a\nreally sound and prosperous footing. An agricultural school has lately\nbeen added, under the supervision of a trained expert. They who are\nqualified to judge speak of the college as a beacon of learning–an\ninstitution whose aims and results are alike deserving of high respect.\nAnd certainly it can boast of a fine list of prominent men who have\nissued from its walls.",
        "This little island of stern mental culture contains, besides twenty-five\nteachers and as many servants, some three hundred scholars preparing for\na variety of secular professions. About fifty of them are\nItalo-Albanians, ten or thereabouts are genuine Albanians from over the\nwater, the rest Italians, among them two dozen of those unhappy orphans\nfrom. Reggio and Messina who flooded the country after the earthquake,\nand were “dumped down” in colleges and private houses all over Italy.\nSome of the boys come of wealthy families in distant parts, their\nparents surmising that San Demetrio offers no temptations to youthful\nfolly and extravagance. In this, so far as I can judge, they are\nperfectly correct.",
        "The heat of summer and the fact that the boys were in the throes of\ntheir examinations may have helped to make the majority of them seem\npale and thin; they certainly complained of their food, and the cook was\nthe only prosperous-looking person whom I could discover in the\nestablishment–his percentages, one suspects, being considerable. The\naverage yearly payment of each scholar for board and tuition is only\ntwenty pounds (it used to be twenty ducats); how shall superfluities be\nincluded in the bill of fare for such a sum?",
        "The class-rooms are modernized; the dormitories neither clean nor very\ndirty; there is a rather scanty gymnasium as well as a physical\nlaboratory and museum of natural history. Among the recent acquisitions\nof the latter is a vulture (Gyps fulvus) which was shot here in the\nspring of this year. The bird, they told me, has never been seen in\nthese regions before; it may have come over from the east, or from\nSardinia, where it still breeds. I ventured to suggest that they should\nlose no time in securing a native porcupine, an interesting beast\nconcerning which I never fail to enquire on my rambles. They used to be\nencountered in the Crati valley; two were shot near Corigliano a few\nyears ago, and another not far from Cotronei on the Neto; they still\noccur in the forests near the “Pagliarelle” above Petilia Policastro;\nbut, judging by all indications, I should say that this animal is\nrapidly approaching extinction not only here, but all over Italy.\nAnother very rare creature, the otter, was killed lately at Vaccarizza,\nbut unfortunately not preserved.",
        "Fencing and music are taught, but those athletic exercises which led to\nthe victories of Marathon and Salamis are not much in vogue–mens sana\nin corpare sana is clearly not the ideal of the place; fighting among\nthe boys is reprobated as “savagery,” and corporal punishment forbidden.\nThere is no playground or workshop, and their sole exercise consists in\ndull promenades along the high road under the supervision of one or more\nteachers, during which the youngsters indulge in attempts at games by\nthe wayside which are truly pathetic. So the old “Inviolable\nConstitutions” ordain that “the scholars must not play outside the\ncollege, and if they meet any one, they should lower their voices.” A\nrule of recent introduction is that in this warm weather they must all\nlie down to sleep for two hours after the midday meal; it may suit the\nmanagers, but the boys consider it a great hardship and would prefer\nbeing allowed to play. Altogether, whatever the intellectual results may\nbe, the moral tendency of such an upbringing is damaging to the spirit\nof youth and must make for precocious frivolity and brutality. But the\npedagogues of Italy are like her legislators: theorists. They close\ntheir eyes to the cardinal principles of all education–that the waste\nproducts and toxins of the imagination are best eliminated by motor\nactivities, and that the immature stage of human development, far from\nbeing artificially shortened, should be prolonged by every possible\nmeans. . If the internal arrangement of this institution is not all it\nmight be as regards the healthy development of youth, the situation of\nthe college resembles the venerable structures of Oxford in that it is\ntoo good, far too good, for mere youngsters. This building, in its\nseclusion from the world, its pastoral surroundings and soul-inspiring\npanorama, is an abode not for boys but for philosophers; a place to fill\nwith a wave of deep content the sage who has outgrown earthly ambitions.\nYour eye embraces the snow-clad heights of Dolcedorme and the Ionian\nSea, wandering over forests, and villages, and rivers, and long reaches\nof fertile country; but it is not the variety of the scene, nor yet the\nhistorical memories of old Sybaris which kindle the imagination so much\nas the spacious amplitude of the whole prospect. In England we think\nsomething of a view of ten miles. Conceive, here, a grandiose valley\nwider than from Dover to Calais, filled with an atmosphere of such\nimpeccable clarity that there are moments when one thinks to see every\nstone and every bush on the mountains yonder, thirty miles distant. And\nthe cloud-effects, towards sunset, are such as would inspire the brush\nof Turner or Claude Lorraine. . . .",
        "For the college, as befits its grave academic character, stands by\nitself among fruitful fields and backed by a chestnut wood, at ten\nminutes’ walk from the crowded streets. It is an imposing edifice–the\nBasilean convent of St. Adrian, with copious modern additions; the\nfounders may well have selected this particular site on account of its\nfountain of fresh water, which flows on as in days of yore. One thinks\nof those communities of monks in the Middle Ages, scattered over this\nwild region and holding rare converse with one another by gloomy forest\npaths–how remote their life and ideals! In the days of Fiore (1691) the\ninmates of this convent still practised their old rites.",
        "The nucleus of the building is the old chapel, containing a remarkable\nfont; two antique columns sawn up (apparently for purposes of\ntransportation from some pagan temple by the shore)–one of them being\nof African marble and the other of grey granite; there is also a\ntessellated pavement with beast-patterns of leopards and serpents akin\nto those of Patir. Bertaux gives a reproduction of this serpent; he\nassimilates it, as regards technique and age, to that which lies before\nthe altar of Monte Cassino and was wrought by Greek artisans of the\nabbot Desiderius. The church itself is held to be two centuries older\nthan that of Patir.",
        "The library, once celebrated, contains musty folios of classics and\ntheir commentators, but nothing of value. It has been ransacked of its\ntreasures like that of Patir, whose disjecta membra have been tracked\ndown by the patience and acumen of Monsignor Batiffol.",
        "Batiffol, Bertaux–Charles Diehl, Jules Gay (who has also written on San\nDemetrio)–Huillard-Breholles–Luynes–Lenormant. . . here are a few\nFrench scholars who have recently studied these regions and their\nhistory. What have we English done in this direction?",
        "Nothing. Absolutely nothing.",
        "Such thoughts occur inevitably.",
        "It may be insinuated that researches of this kind are gleanings; that\nour English genius lies rather in the spade-work of pioneers like Leake\nor Layard. Granted. But a hard fact remains; the fact, namely, that\ncould any of our scholars have been capable of writing in the large and\nprofound manner of Bertaux or Gay, not one of our publishers would have\nundertaken to print his work. Not one. They know their business; they\nknow that such a book would have been a dead loss. Therefore let us\nfrankly confess the truth: for things of the mind there is a smaller\nmarket in England than in France. How much smaller only they can tell,\nwho have familiarized themselves with other departments of French thought.",
        "Here, then, I have lived for the past few days, strolling among the\nfields, and attempting to shape some picture of these Albanians from\ntheir habits and such of their literature as has been placed at my\ndisposal. So far, my impression of them has not changed since the days\nwhen I used to rest at their villages, in Greece. They remind me of the\nIrish. Both races are scattered over the earth and seem to prosper best\noutside their native country; they have the same songs and bards, the\nsame hero-chieftains, the same com-bativeness and frank hospitality;\nboth are sunk in bigotry and broils; they resemble one another in their\nlove of dirt, disorder and display, in their enthusiastic and\nadventurous spirit, their versatile brilliance of mind, their incapacity\nfor self-government and general (Keltic) note of inspired inefficiency.\nAnd both profess a frenzied allegiance to an obsolete tongue which, were\nit really cultivated as they wish, would put a barrier of triple brass\nbetween themselves and the rest of humanity.",
        "Even as the Irish despise the English as their worldly and effete\nrelatives, so the Albanians look down upon the Greeks–even those of\nPericles–with profoundest contempt. The Albanians, so says one of their\nwriters, are “the oldest people upon earth,” and their language is the\n\"divine Pelasgic mother-tongue.” I grew interested awhile in Stanislao\nMarchiano’s plausibly entrancing study on this language, as well as in a\npamphlet of de Rada’s on the same subject; but my ardour has cooled\nsince learning, from another native grammarian, that these writers are\nhopelessly in the wrong on nearly every point. So much is certain, that\nthe Albanian language already possesses more than thirty different\nalphabets (each of them with nearly fifty letters). Nevertheless they\nhave not yet, in these last four (or forty) thousand years, made up\ntheir minds which of them to adopt, or whether it would not be wisest,\nafter all, to elaborate yet another one–a thirty-first. And so\ndifficult is their language with any of these alphabets that even after\na five days’ residence on the spot I still find myself puzzled by such\nsimple passages as this:",
        "I will only add that the translation of such a passage–it contains\ntwenty-eight accents which I have omitted–is mere child’s play to its\npronunciation.",
        "Sometimes I find my way to the village of Macchia, distant about three\nmiles from San Demetrio. It is a dilapidated but picturesque cluster of\nhouses, situate on a projecting tongue of land which is terminated by a\nlittle chapel to Saint Elias, the old sun-god Helios, lover of peaks and\npromontories, whom in his Christian shape the rude Albanian colonists\nbrought hither from their fatherland, even as, centuries before, he had\naccompanied the Byzantines on the same voyage and, fifteen centuries yet\nearlier, the Greeks.",
        "At Macchia was born, in 1814, of an old and relatively wealthy family,\nGirolamo de Rada, [Footnote: Thus his friend and compatriot, Dr. Michele\nMarchiano, spells the name in a biography which I recommend to those who\nthink there is no intellectual movement in South Italy. But he himself,\nat the very close of his life, in 1902, signs himself Ger. de Rhada. So\nthis village of Macchia is spelt indifferently by Albanians as Maki or\nMakji. They have a fine Elizabethan contempt for orthography–as well\nthey may have, with their thirty alphabets.] a flame-like patriot in\nwhom the tempestuous aspirations of modern Albania took shape. The ideal\npursued during his long life was the regeneration of his country; and if\nthe attention of international congresses and linguists and folklorists\nis now drawn to this little corner of the earth–if, in 1902,\ntwenty-one newspapers were devoted to the Albanian cause (eighteen in\nItaly alone, and one even in London)–it was wholly his merit.",
        "He was the son of a Greco-Catholic priest. After a stern religious\nupbringing under the paternal roof at Macchia and in the college of San\nDemetrio, he was sent to Naples to complete his education. It is\ncharacteristic of the man that even in the heyday of youth he cared\nlittle for modern literature and speculations and all that makes for\nexact knowledge, and that he fled from his Latin teacher, the celebrated\nPuoti, on account of his somewhat exclusive love of grammatical rules.\nNone the less, though con-genitally averse to the materialistic and\nsubversive theories that were then seething in Naples, he became\nentangled in the anti-Bourbon movements of the late thirties, and\nnarrowly avoided the death-penalty which struck down some of his\ncomrades. At other times his natural piety laid him open to the\naccusation of reactionary monarchical leanings.",
        "He attributed his escape from this and every other peril to the hand of\nGod. Throughout life he was a zealous reader of the Bible, a firm and\neven ascetic believer, forever preoccupied, in childlike simplicity of\nsoul, with first causes. His spirit moved majestically in a world of\nfervent platitudes. The whole Cosmos lay serenely distended before his\nmental vision; a benevolent God overhead, devising plans for the\nprosperity of Albania; a malignant, ubiquitous and very real devil,\nthwarting these His good intentions whenever possible; mankind on earth,\nsowing and reaping in the sweat of their brow, as was ordained of old.\nLike many poets, he never disabused his mind of this comfortable form of\nanthropomorphism. He was a firm believer, too, in dreams. But his\nguiding motive, his sun by day and star by night, was a belief in the\n\"mission” of the Pelasgian race now scattered about the shores of the\nInland Sea–in Italy, Sicily, Greece, Dalmatia, Roumania, Asia Minor,\nEgypt–a belief as ardent and irresponsible as that which animates the\nLost Tribe enthusiasts of England. He considered that the world hardly\nrealized how much it owed to his countryfolk; according to his views,\nAchilles, Philip of Macedon, Alexander the Great, Aristotle, Pyrrhus,\nDiocletian, Julian the Apostate–they were all Albanians. Yet even\ntowards the end of his life he is obliged to confess:–",
        "“But the evil demon who for over four thousand years has been hindering\nthe Pelasgian race from collecting itself into one state, is still\nendeavouring by insidious means to thwart the work which would lead it\nto that union.”",
        "Disgusted with the clamorous and intriguing bustle of Naples, he\nretired, at the early age of 34, to his natal village of Macchia,\nthrowing over one or two offers of lucrative worldly appointments. He\ndescribes himself as wholly disenchanted with the “facile fatuity” of\nLiberalism, the fact being, that he lacked what a French psychologist\nhas called the function of the real; his temperament was not of the\nkind to cope with actualities. This retirement is an epoch in his\nlife–it is the Grand Renunciation. Henceforward he loses personal touch\nwith thinking humanity. At Macchia he remained, brooding on Albanian\nwrongs, devising remedies, corresponding with foreigners and\nwriting–ever writing; consuming his patrimony in the cause of Albania,\ntill the direst poverty dogged his footsteps.",
        "I have read some of his Italian works. They are curiously oracular, like\nthe whisperings of those fabled Dodonian oaks of his fatherland; they\nheave with a darkly-virile mysticism. He shares Blake’s ruggedness, his\ntorrential and confused utterance, his benevolence, his flashes of\nluminous inspiration, his moral background. He resembles that visionary\nin another aspect: he was a consistent and passionate adorer of the\nEwig-weibliche. Some of the female characters in his poems retain\ntheir dewy freshness, their exquisite originality, even after passing\nthrough the translator’s crucible.",
        "At the age of 19 he wrote a poem on “Odysseus,” which was published\nunder a pseudonym. Then, three years later, there appeared a collection\nof rhapsodies entitled “Milosao,” which he had garnered from the lips of\nAlbanian village maidens. It is his best-known work, and has been\ntranslated into Italian more than once. After his return to Macchia\nfollowed some years of apparent sterility, but later on, and especially\nduring the last twenty years of his life, his literary activity became\nprodigious. Journalism, folklore, poetry, history, grammar, philology,\nethnology, aesthetics, politics, morals–nothing came amiss to his\ngifted pen, and he was fruitful, say his admirers, even in his errors,\nLike other men inflamed with one single idea, he boldly ventured into\ndomains of thought where specialists fear to tread. His biographer\nenumerates forty-three different works from his pen. They all throb with\na resonant note of patriotism; they are “fragments of a heart,” and\nindeed, it has been said of him that he utilized even the grave science\nof grammar as a battlefield whereon to defy the enemies of Albania. But\nperhaps he worked most successfully as a journalist. His “Fiamuri\nArberit” (the Banner of Albania) became the rallying cry of his\ncountrymen in every corner of the earth.",
        "These multifarious writings–and doubtless the novelty of his central\ntheme–attracted the notice of German philologers and linguists, of all\nlovers of freedom, folklore and verse. Leading Italian writers like\nCantupraised him highly; Lamartine, in 1844, wrote to him: “Je suis\nbien-heureux de ce signe de fraternite poetique et politique entre vous\net moi. La poesie est venue de vos rivages et doit y retourner. . . .\"\nHermann Buchholtz discovers scenic changes worthy of Shakespeare, and\npassages of Aeschylean grandeur, in his tragedy “Sofonisba.” Carnet\ncompares him with Dante, and the omniscient Mr. Gladstone wrote in\n1880–a post card, presumably–belauding his disinterested efforts on\nbehalf of his country. He was made the subject of many articles and\npamphlets, and with reason. Up to his time, Albania had been a myth. He\nit was who divined the relationship between the Albanian and Pelasgian\ntongues; who created the literary language of his country, and\nformulated its political ambitions.",
        "Whereas the hazy “Autobiologia” records complicated political intrigues\nat Naples that are not connected with his chief strivings, the little\n\"Testamento politico,” printed towards the end of his life, is more\ninteresting. It enunciates his favourite and rather surprising theory\nthat the Albanians cannot look for help and sympathy save only to their\nbrothers, the Turks. Unlike many Albanians on either side of the\nAdriatic, he was a pronounced Turco-phile, detesting the “stolid\nperfidy” and “arrogant disloyalty” of the Greeks. Of Austria, the most\ninsidious enemy of his country’s freedom, he seems to have thought well.\nA year before his death he wrote to an Italian translator of “Milosao\"\n(I will leave the passage in the original, to show his cloudy language):",
        "“Ed un tempo propizio la accompagna: la ricostituzione dell’ Epiro nei\nsuoi quattro vilayet autonomi quale e nei propri consigli e nei propri\ndesideri; ricostituzione, che pel suo Giornale, quello dell’ ottimo A.\nLorecchio–cui precede il principe Nazionale Kastriota, Chini–si\nannuncia fatale, e quasi fulcro della stabilita dello impero Ottomano, a\ndella pace Europea; preludio di quella diffusione del regno di Dio sulla\nterra, che sara la Pace tra gli Uomini.”",
        "Truly a remarkable utterance, and one that illustrates the disadvantages\nof living at a distance from the centres of thought. Had he travelled\nless with the spirit and more with the body, his opinions might have\nbeen modified and corrected. But he did not even visit the Albanian\ncolonies in Italy and Sicily. Hence that vast confidence in his\nmission–a confidence born of solitude, intellectual and geographical.\nHence that ultra-terrestrial yearning which tinges his apparently\npractical aspirations.",
        "He remained at home, ever poor and industrious; wrapped in bland\nexaltation and oblivious to contemporary movements of the human mind.\nNot that his existence was without external activities. A chair of\nAlbanian literature at San Demetrio, instituted in 1849 but suppressed\nafter three years, was conferred on him in 1892 by the historian and\nminister Pasquale Villari; for a considerable time, too, he was director\nof the communal school at Corigliano, where, with characteristic energy,\nhe set up a printing press; violent journalistic campaigns succeeded one\nanother; in 1896 he arranged for the first congress of Albanian language\nin that town, which brought together delegates from every part of Italy\nand elicited a warm telegram of felicitation from the minister\nFrancesco Crispi, himself an Albanian. Again, in 1899, we find him\nreading a paper before the twelfth international congress of\nOrientalists at Rome.",
        "But best of all, he loved the seclusion of Macchia.",
        "Griefs clustered thickly about the closing years of this unworldly\ndreamer. Blow succeeded blow. One by one, his friends dropped off; his\nbrothers, his beloved wife, his four sons–he survived them all; he\nstood alone at last, a stricken figure, in tragic and sublime isolation.\nOver eighty years old, he crawled thrice a week to deliver his lectures\nat San Demetrio; he still cultivated a small patch of ground with\nenfeebled arm, composing, for relaxation, poems and rhapsodies at the\npatriarchal age of 88! They will show you the trees under which he was\nwont to rest, the sunny views he loved, the very stones on which he sat;\nthey will tell you anecdotes of his poverty–of an indigence such as we\ncan scarcely credit. During the last months he was often thankful for a\ncrust of bread, in exchange for which he would bring a sack of acorns,\nself-collected, to feed the giver’s pigs. Destitution of this kind,\nbrought about by unswerving loyalty to an ideal, ceases to exist in its\nsordid manifestations: it exalts the sufferer. And his life’s work is\nthere. Hitherto there had been no “Albanian Question” to perplex the\nchanceries of Europe. He applied the match to the tinder; he conjured up\nthat phantom which refuses to be laid.",
        "He died, in 1903, at San Demetrio; and there lies entombed in the\ncemetery on the hill-side, among the oaks.",
        "But you will not easily find his grave.",
        "His biographer indulges a poetic fancy in sketching the fair monument\nwhich a grateful country will presently rear to his memory on the snowy\nAcroceraunian heights. It might be well, meanwhile, if some simple\ncommemorative stone were placed on the spot where he lies buried. Had he\nsuccumbed at his natal Macchia, this would have been done; but death\novertook him in the alien parish of San Demetrio, and his remains were\nmingled with those of its poorest citizens. A microcosmic illustration\nof that clannish spirit of Albania which he had spent a lifetime in\nendeavouring to direct to nobler ends!",
        "He was the Mazzini of his nation.",
        "A Garibaldi, when the crisis comes, may possibly emerge from that\ntumultuous horde.",
        "Where is the Cavour?",
        "A driving road to connect San Demetrio with Acri whither I was now bound\nwas begun, they say, about twenty years ago; one can follow it for a\nconsiderable distance beyond the Albanian College. Then, suddenly, it\nends. Walking to Acri, however, by the old track, one picks up, here and\nthere, conscientiously-engineered little stretches of it, already\novergrown with weeds; these, too, break off as abruptly as they began,\nin the wild waste. For purposes of wheeled traffic these picturesque but\ndisconnected fragments are quite useless.",
        "Perhaps the whole undertaking will be completed some day–speriamo! as\nthe natives say, when speaking of something rather beyond reasonable\nexpectation. But possibly not; and in that case–pazienza! meaning,\nthat all hope may now be abandoned. There is seldom any great hurry,\nwith non-governmental works of this kind.",
        "It would be interesting if one could learn the inner history of these\nabortive transactions. I have often tried, in vain. It is impossible for\nan outsider to pierce the jungle of sordid mystery and intrigue which\nsurrounds them. So much I gathered: that the original contract was based\non the wages then current and that, the price of labour having more than\ndoubled in consequence of the “discovery” of America, no one will\nundertake the job on the old terms. That is sufficiently intelligible.\nBut why operations proceeded so slowly at first, and why a new contract\ncannot now be drawn up–who can tell! The persons interested blame the\ncontractor, who blames the engineer, who blames the dilatory and corrupt\nadministration of Cosenza. My private opinion is, that the last three\nparties have agreed to share the swag between them. Meanwhile everybody\nhas just grounds of complaint against everybody else; the six or seven\ninevitable lawsuits have sprung up and promise to last any length of\ntime, seeing that important documents have been lost or stolen and that\nhalf the original contracting parties have died in the interval: nobody\nknows what is going to happen in the end. It all depends upon whether\nsome patriotic person will step forward and grease the wheels in the\nproper quarter.",
        "And even then, if he hails from Acri, they of San Demetrio will probably\nwork against the project, and vice versa. For no love is lost between\nneighbouring communities–wonderful, with what venomous feudal animosity\nthey regard each other! United Italy means nothing to these people,\nwhose conceptions of national and public life are those of the cock on\nhis dung-hill. You will find in the smallest places intelligent and\nbroad-minded men, tradespeople or professionals or landed proprietors,\nbut they are seldom members of the municipio; the municipal career is\nalso a money-making business, yes; but of another kind, and requiring\nother qualifications.",
        "Foot-passengers like myself suffer no inconvenience by being obliged to\nfollow the shorter and time-honoured mule-track that joins the two\nplaces. It rises steeply at first, then begins to wind in and out among\nshady vales of chestnut and oak, affording unexpected glimpses now\ntowards distant Tarsia and now, through a glade on the right, on to the\nancient citadel of Bisignano, perched on its rock.",
        "I reached Acri after about two and a half hours’ walking. It lies in a\ntheatrical situation and has a hotel; but the proprietor of that\nestablishment having been described to me as “the greatest brigand of\nthe Sila” I preferred to refresh myself at a small wineshop, whose\nmanageress cooked me an uncommonly good luncheon and served some of the\nbest wine I had tasted for long. Altogether, the better-class women here\nare far more wideawake and civilized than those of the Neapolitan\nprovince; a result of their stern patriarchal up-bringing and of their\npossessing more or less sensible husbands.",
        "Thus fortified, I strolled about the streets. One would like to spend a\nweek or two in a place like this, so little known even to Italians, but\nthe hot weather and bad feeding had begun to affect me disagreeably and\nI determined to push on without delay into cooler regions. It would\nnever do to be laid up at Acri with heatstroke, and to have one’s last\ndrops of life drained away by copious blood-lettings, relic of\nHispano-Arabic practices and the favourite remedy for every complaint.\nAcri is a large place, and its air of prosperity contrasts with the\nslumberous decay of San Demetrio; there is silk-rearing, and so much\nemigration into America that nearly every man I addressed replied in\nEnglish. New houses are rising up in all directions, and the place is\ncelebrated for its rich citizens.",
        "But these same wealthy men are in rather a dilemma. Some local\nauthority, I forget who, has deduced from the fact that there are so\nmany forges and smiths’ shops here that this must be the spot to which\nthe over-sensitive inhabitants of Sybaris banished their workers in\nmetal and other noisy professions. Now the millionaires would like to be\nthought Sybarites by descent, but it is hardly respectable to draw a\npedigree from these outcasts.",
        "They need not alarm themselves. For Acri, as Forbiger has shown, is the\nold Acherontia; the river Acheron, the Mocone or Mucone of to-day, flows\nat its foot, and from one point of the town I had a fine view into its\nraging torrent.",
        "A wearisome climb of two hours brought me to the Croce Greca, the\nGreek Cross, which stands 1185 metres above sea-level. How hot it was,\nin that blazing sun! I should be sorry to repeat the trip, under the\nsame conditions. A structure of stone may have stood here in olden days;\nat present it is a diminutive wooden crucifix by the roadside. It marks,\nnone the less, an important geographical point: the boundary between the\n\"Greek” Sila which I was now leaving and the Sila Grande, the central\nand largest region. Beyond this last-named lies the lesser Sila, or\n\"Sila Piccola “; and if you draw a line from Rogliano (near Cosenza) to\nCotrone you will approximately strike the watershed which divides the\nSila Grande from this last and most westerly of the three Sila\ndivisions. After that comes Catanzaro and the valley of the Corace, the\nnarrowest point of the Italian continent, and then the heights of Serra\nand Aspromonte, the true “Italy” of old, that continue as far as Reggio.",
        "Though I passed through some noble groves of chestnut on the way up, the\ncountry here was a treeless waste. Yet it must have been forest up to a\nshort time ago, for one could see the beautiful vegetable mould which\nhas not yet had time to be washed down the hill-sides. A driving road\npasses the Croce Greca; it joins Acri with San Giovanni, the capital of\nSila Grande, and with Cosenza.",
        "It was another long hour’s march, always uphill, before I reached a\nspacious green meadow or upland with a few little buildings. The place\nis called Verace and lies on the watershed between the upper Crati\nvalley and the Ionian; thenceforward my walk would be a descent along\nthe Trionto river, the Traeis of old, as far as Longo-bucco which\noverlooks its flood. It was cool here at last, from the altitude and the\ndecline of day; and hay-making was going on, amid the pastoral din of\ncow-bells and a good deal of blithe love-making and chattering.",
        "After some talk with these amiable folks, I passed on to where\nthe young Traeis bubbles up from the cavernous reservoirs of the earth.\nOf those chill and roguish wavelets I took a draught, mindful of the day\nwhen long ago, by these same waters, an irreparable catastrophe\noverwhelmed our European civilization. For it was the Traeis near whose\nestuary was fought the battle between 300,000 Sybarites (I refuse to\nbelieve these figures) and the men of Croton conducted by their champion\nMilo–a battle which led to the destruction of Sybaris and,\nincidentally, of Hellenic culture throughout the mainland of Italy. This\nwas in the same fateful year 510 that witnessed the expulsion of the\nTarquins from Rome and the Pisistratidae from Athens.",
        "Pines, the characteristic tree of the Sila, now begin to appear. Passing\nthrough Verace I had already observed, on the left, a high mountain\nentirely decked with them. It is the ridge marked Pale-parto on the map;\nthe Trionto laves its foot. But the local pronunciation of this name is\nPalepite, and I cannot help thinking that here we have a genuine old\nGreek name perpetuated by the people and referring to this covering of\nhoary pines–a name which the cartographers, arbitrary and ignorant as\nthey often are, have unconsciously disguised. (It occurs in some old\ncharts, however, as Paleparto.) An instructive map of Italy could be\ndrawn up, showing the sites and cities wrongly named from corrupt\netymology or falsified inscriptions, and those deliberately miscalled\nout of principles of local patriotism. The whole country is full of\nthese inventions of litterati which date, for the most part, from the\nenthusiastic but undisciplined Cinque-Cento.",
        "The minute geographical triangle comprised between Cosenza, Longobucco\nand San Demetrio which I was now traversing is one of the least known\ncorners of Italy, and full of dim Hellenic memories. The streamlet\n\"Calamo” flows through the valley I ascended from Acri, and at its side,\na little way out of the town, stands the fountain “Pompeio” where the\nbrigands, not long ago, used to lie in wait for women and children\ncoming to fetch water, and snatch them away for ransom. On the way up, I\nhad glimpses down a thousand feet or more into the Mucone or Acheron,\nraging and foaming in its narrow valley. It rises among the mountains\ncalled “Fallistro” and “Li Tartari\"–unquestionably Greek names.",
        "On this river and somewhere above Acri stood, according to the scholarly\nresearches of Lenormant, the ancient city of Pandosia. I do not know if\nits site has been determined since his day. It was “very strong” and\nrich and at its highest prosperity in the fourth century B.C.; after the\nfall of Sybaris it passed under the supremacy of Croton. The god Pan was\nfigured on some of its coins, and appropriately enough, considering its\nsylvan surroundings; others bear the head of the nymph Pandosia with her\nname and that of the river Crathis, under the guise of a young shepherd:\nthey who wish to learn his improper legend will find it in the pages of\nAelian, or in chapter xxxii of the twenty-fifth book of Rhodiginus,\nbeginning Quae sit brutorum affectio, etc. [Footnote: Brunii a\nbrutis moribus: so say certain spiteful writers, an accusation which\nStrabo and Horace extend to all Calabrians. As to the site of Pandosia,\na good number of scholars, such as old Prosper Parisius and Luigi Maria\nGreco, locate it at the village of Mendicino on the river Merenzata,\nwhich was called Arconte (? Acheron) in the Middle Ages. So the Trionto\nis not unquestionably the Traeis, and in Marincola Pistoia’s good little\n\"Cose di Sibari” (1845) the distinction is claimed for one of four\nrivers–the Lipuda, Colognati, Trionto, or Fiuminica.]",
        "We have here not the Greece of mediaeval Byzantine times, much less that\nof the Albanians, but the sunny Hellas of the days when the world was\nyoung, when these ardent colonists sailed westwards to perpetuate their\nnames and legends in the alien soil of Italy.",
        "The Mucone has always been known as a ferocious and pitiless torrent,\nand maintains to this day its Tartarean reputation. Twenty persons a\nyear, they tell me, are devoured by its angry waters: mangia venti\ncristiani all’ anno! This is as bad as the Amendolea near Reggio. But\nnone of its victims have attained the celebrity of Alexander of\nMolossus, King of Epirus, who perished under the walls of Pandosia in\n326 B.C. during an excursion against the Lucanians. He had been warned\nby the oracle of Dodona to avoid the waters of Acheron and the town of\nPandosia; once in Italy, however, he paid small heed to these words,\nthinking they referred to the river and town of the same name in\nThesprotia. But the gods willed otherwise, and you may read of his death\nin the waters, and the laceration of his body by the Lucanians, in\nLivy’s history.",
        "It is a strange caprice that we should now possess what is in every\nprobability the very breastplate worn by the heroic monarch on that\noccasion. It was found in 1820, and thereafter sold–some fragments of\nit, at least–to the British Museum, where under the name of “Bronze of\nSiris” it may still be admired: a marvellous piece of repoussee work, in\nthe style of Lysippus, depicting the combat of Ajax and the Amazons. . . .",
        "The streamlet Trionto, my companion to Longobucco, glides along between\nstretches of flowery meadow-land–fit emblem of placid rural\ncontentment. But soon this lyric mood is spent. It enters a winding\ngorge that shuts out the sunlight and the landscape abruptly assumes an\nepic note; the water tumbles wildly downward, hemmed in by mountains\nwhose slopes are shrouded in dusky pines wherever a particle of soil\naffords them foothold. The scenery in this valley is as romantic as any\nin the Sila. Affluents descend on either side, while the swollen rivulet\nwrithes and screeches in its narrow bed, churning the boulders with\nhideous din. The track, meanwhile, continues to run beside the water\ntill the passage becomes too difficult; it must perforce attack the\nhill-side. Up it climbs, therefore, in never-ending ascension, and then\nmeanders at a great height above the valley, in and out of its tributary\nglens.",
        "I was vastly enjoying this promenade–the shady pines, whose fragrance\nmingled with that of a legion of tall aromatic plants in full\nblossom–the views upon the river, shining far below me like the thread\nof silver–when I observed with surprise that the whole mountain-side\nwhich the track must manifestly cross had lately slipped down into the\nabyss. A cloud-burst two or three days ago, as I afterwards learned, had\ndone the mischief. On arrival at the spot, the path was seen to be\ninterrupted–clean gone, in fact, and not a shred of earth or trees\nleft; there confronted me a bare scar, a wall of naked rock which not\neven a chamois could negotiate. Here was a dilemma. I must either\nretrace my steps along the weary road to Verace and there seek a night’s\nshelter with the gentle hay-makers, or clamber down into the ravine,\nfollow the river and–chance it! After anxious deliberation, the latter\nalternative was chosen.",
        "But the Trionto was now grown into a formidable torrent of surging waves\nand eddies, with a perverse inclination to dash from one side to the\nother of its prison, so as to necessitate frequent fordings on my part.\nThese watery passages, which I shall long remember, were not without a\ncertain danger. The stream was still swollen with the recent rains, and\nits bed, invisible under the discoloured element, sufficiently deep to\ninspire respect and studded, furthermore, with slippery boulders of\nevery size, concealing insidious gulfs. Having only a short\nwalking-stick to support me through this raging flood, I could not but\npicture to myself the surprise of the village maidens of Crepolati,\nlower down, on returning to their laundry work by the river-side next\nmorning and discovering the battered anatomy of an Englishman–a rare\nfish, in these waters–stranded upon their familiar beach. Murdered, of\ncourse. What a galaxy of brigand legends would have clustered round my\nmemory!",
        "Evening was closing in, and I had traversed the stream so often and\nstumbled so long amid this chaos of roaring waters and weirdly-tinted\nrocks, that I began to wonder whether the existence of Longobucco was\nnot a myth. But suddenly, at a bend of the river, the whole town, still\ndistant, was revealed, upraised on high and framed in the yawning mouth\nof the valley. After the solitary ramble of that afternoon, my eyes\nfamiliarized to nothing save the wild things of nature, this unexpected\nglimpse of complicated, civilized structures had all the improbability\nof a mirage. Longo-bucco, at that moment, arose before me like those\ndream-cities in the Arabian tale, conjured by enchantment out of the\ndesert waste.",
        "The vision, though it swiftly vanished again, cheered me on till after a\ngood deal more scrambling and wading, with boots torn to rags, lame,\nfamished and drenched to the skin, I reached the bridge of the Rossano\nhighway and limped upwards, in the twilight, to the far-famed “Hotel\nVittoria.”",
        "Soon enough, be sure, I was enquiring as to supper. But the manageress\nmet my suggestions about eatables with a look of blank astonishment.",
        "Was there nothing in the house, then? No cheese, or meat, or maccheroni,\nor eggs–no wine to drink?",
        "“Nothing!” she replied. “Why should you eat things at this hour? You\nmust find them yourself, if you really want them. I might perhaps\nprocure you some bread.”",
        "Avis aux voyageurs, as the French say.",
        "Undaunted, I went forth and threw myself upon the mercy of a citizen of\npromising exterior, who listened attentively to my case. Though far too\npolite to contradict, I could see that nothing in the world would induce\nhim to credit the tale of my walking from San Demetrio that day–it was\ntacitly relegated to the regions of fable. With considerable tact, so as\nnot to wound my feelings, he avoided expressing any opinion on so\nfrivolous a topic; nor did the reason of his reluctance to discuss my\nexploit dawn upon me till I realized, later on, that like many of the\ninhabitants he had never heard of the track over Acri, and consequently\ndisbelieved its existence. They reach San Demetrio by a two or even\nthree days’ drive over Rossano, Corigliano, and Vaccarizza. He became\nconvinced, however, that for some reason or other I was hungry, and\nthereupon good-naturedly conducted me to various places where wine and\nother necessities of life were procured.",
        "The landlady watched me devouring this fare, more astonished than\never–indeed, astonishment seemed to be her chronic condition so long as\nI was under her roof. But the promised bread was not forthcoming, for\nthe simple reason that there was none in the house. She had said that\nshe could procure it for me, not that she possessed it; now, since I had\ngiven no orders to that effect, she had not troubled about it.",
        "Nobody travels south of Rome. . . .",
        "Strengthened beyond expectation by this repast, I sallied into the night\nonce more, and first of all attended an excellent performance at the\nlocal cinematograph. After that, I was invited to a cup of coffee by\ncertain burghers, and we strolled about the piazza awhile, taking our\npleasure in the cool air of evening (the town lies 794 metres above\nsea-level). Its streets are orderly and clean; there are no Albanians,\nand no costumes of any kind. Here, firm-planted on the square, and\njutting at an angle from the body of the church, stands a massive\nbell-tower overgrown from head to foot with pendent weeds and grasses\nwhose roots have found a home in the interstices of its masonry; a\ngrimly venerable pile, full of character.",
        "Weary but not yet satiated, I took leave of the citizens and\nperambulated the more ignoble quarters, all of which are decently\nlighted with electricity. Everywhere in these stiller regions was the\nsound of running waters, and I soon discerned that Longobucco is an\nimprovement on the usual site affected by Calabrian hill-towns–the\nY-shaped enclosure, namely, at the junction of two rivers–inasmuch as\nit has contrived to perch itself on a lofty platform protected by no\nless than three streams that rush impetuously under its walls: the\nTrionto and two of its affluents. On the flank inclined towards the\nIonian there is a veritable chasm; the Trionto side is equally difficult\nof approach–the rear, of course, inaccessible. No wonder the brigands\nchose it for their chief citadel.",
        "I am always on the look-out for modern epigraphical curiosities;\nregarding the subject as one of profound social significance (postage\nstamps, indeed!) I have assiduously formed a collection, the envy of\nconnaisseurs, about one-third of whose material, they tell me, might\npossibly be printed at Brussels or Geneva. Well, here is a mural\ngraffito secured in the course of this evening’s walk:",
        "Abaso [sic] questo paese sporco incivile: down with this dirty savage\ncountry!",
        "There is food for thought in this inscription. For if some bilious\nhyper-civilized stranger were its author, the sentiments might pass. But\ncoming from a native, to what depths of morbid discontent do they\ntestify! Considering the recent progress of these regions that has led\nto a security and prosperity formerly undreamed of, one is driven to the\nconjecture that these words can only have been penned by some\ncantankerous churl of an emigrant returning to his native land after an\neaseful life in New York and compelled–\"for his sins,” as he would put\nit–to reside at the “Hotel Vittoria.”",
        "Towards that delectable hostelry I now turned, somewhat regretfully, to\nface a bedroom whose appearance had already inspired me with anything\nbut confidence. But hardly were the preliminary investigations begun,\nwhen a furious noise in the street below drew me to the window once\nmore. Half the town was passing underneath in thronged procession, with\nlighted torches and flags, headed by the municipal band discoursing\nmartial strains of music.",
        "Whither wending, at this midnight hour?",
        "To honour a young student, native of the place, now returning up the\nRossano road from Naples, where he had distinguished himself prominently\nin some examination. I joined the crowd, and presently we were met by a\nsmall carriage whence there emerged a pallid and frail adolescent with\nburning eyes, who was borne aloft in triumph and cheered with that\nvociferous, masculine heartiness which we Englishmen reserve for our\npopular prize-fighters. And this in the classic land of brigandage and\nbloodshed!",
        "The intellectual under-current. . . .",
        "It was an apt commentary on my graffito. And another, more personally\npoignant, not to say piquant, was soon to follow: the bed. But no. I\nwill say nothing about the bed, nothing whatever; nothing beyond this,\nthat it yielded an entomological harvest which surpassed my wildest\nexpectations.",
        "Conspicuous among the wise men of Longobucco in olden days was the\nphysician Bruno, who “flourished” about the end of the thirteenth\ncentury. He called himself Longoburgensis Calaber, and his great\ntreatise on anatomical dissection, embodying much Greek and Arabic lore,\nwas printed many years after his death. Another was Francesco Maria\nLabonia; he wrote, in 1664, “De vera loci urbis Timesinae situatione,\netc.,” to prove, presumably, that his birthplace occupied the site\nwhence the Homeric ore of Temese was derived. There are modern writers\nwho support this view.",
        "The local silver mines were exploited in antiquity; first by Sybaris,\nthen by Croton. They are now abandoned, but a good deal has been written\nabout them. In the year 1200 a thousand miners were employed, and the\nAnjous extracted a great deal of precious metal thence; the goldsmiths\nof Longobucco were celebrated throughout Italy during the Middle Ages.\nThe industrious H. W. Schulz has unearthed a Royal rescript of 1274\ncharging a certain goldsmith Johannes of Longobucco with researches into\nthe metal and salt resources of the whole kingdom of Naples.",
        "Writing from Longobucco in 1808 during a brigand-hunt, Duret de Tavel says:",
        "“The high wooded mountains which surround this horrible place spread\nover it a sombre and savage tint which saddens the imagination. This\nborough contains a hideous population of three thousand souls, composed\nof nail-makers, of blacksmiths and charcoal-burners. The former\ngovernment employed them in working the silver mines situated in the\nneighbourhood which are now abandoned.”",
        "He tells a good deal about the brigandage that was then rife here, and\nthe atrocities which the repression of this pest entailed. Soon after\nhis arrival, for instance, four hundred soldiers were sent to a village\nwhere the chiefs of the brigand “insurrection” were supposed to be\nsheltered. The soldiers, he says, “poured into the streets like a\ntorrent in flood, and there began a horrible massacre, rendered\ninevitable by the obstinacy of the insurgents, who fired from all the\nhouses. This unhappy village was sacked and burnt, suffering all the\nhorrors inseparable from a capture by assault.” Two hundred dead were\nfound in the streets. But the brigand chiefs, the sole pretext of this\nbloodshed, managed to escape. Perhaps they were not within fifty miles\nof the place.",
        "Be that as it may, they were captured later on by their own compatriots,\nafter the French had waited a month at Longobucco. Their heads were\nbrought in, still bleeding, and “l’identite ayant ete suffisamment\nconstatee, la mort des principaux acteurs a termine cette sanglante\ntragedie, et nous sommes sortis de ces catacombes apennines pour revoir\nle plus brillant soleil.”",
        "Wonderful tales are still told of the brigands in these forests. They\nwill show you notches on the trees, cut by such and such a brigand for\nsome particular purpose of communication with his friends; buried\ntreasure has been found, and even nowadays shepherds sometimes discover\nrude shelters of bark and tree trunks built by them in the thickest part\nof the woods. There are legends, too, of caverns wherein they hived\ntheir booty–caverns with cleverly concealed entrances–caverns which\n(many of them, at least) I regard as a pure invention modelled after the\nauthentic brigand caves of Salerno and Abruzzi, where the limestone rock\nis of the kind to produce them. Bourbonism fostered the brood, and there\nwas a fierce recrudescence in the troubled sixties. They lived in bands,\n squadrigli, burning and plundering with impunity. Whoever refused to\ncomply with their demands for food or money was sure to repent of it.\nAll this is over, for the time being; the brigands are extirpated, to\nthe intense relief of the country people, who were entirely at their\nmercy, and whose boast it is that their district is now as safe as the\nstreets of Naples. Qualified praise, this. . . . [Footnote: See next\nchapter.]",
        "It is an easy march of eight hours or less, through pleasing scenery and\nby a good track, from Longobucco to San Giovanni in Fiore, the capital\nof the Sila. The path leaves Longobucco at the rear of the town and,\nclimbing upward, enters a valley which it follows to its head. The\npeasants have cultivated patches of ground along the stream; the slopes\nare covered, first with chestnuts and then with hoary firs–a rare\ngrowth, in these parts–from whose branches hangs the golden bough of\nthe mistletoe. And now the stream is ended and a dark ridge blocks the\nway; it is overgrown with beeches, under whose shade you ascend in steep\ncurves. At the summit the vegetation changes once more, and you find\nyourself among magnificent stretches of pines that continue as far as\nthe governmental domain of Galoppano, a forestal station, two hours’\nwalk from Longobucco.",
        "This pine is a particular variety (Pinus lancio, var. Calabra),\nknown as the “Pino della Sila\"–it is found over this whole country,\nand grows to a height of forty metres with a silvery-grey trunk,\nexhaling a delicious aromatic fragrance. In youth, especially where the\nsoil is deep, it shoots up prim and demure as a Nuremberg toy; but in\nold age grows monstrous. High-perched upon some lonely granite boulder,\nwith roots writhing over the bare stone like the arms of an octopus, it\nsits firm and unmoved, deriding the tempest and flinging fantastic limbs\ninto the air–emblem of tenacity in desolation. From these trees, which\nin former times must have covered the Sila region, was made that\nBruttian pitch mentioned by Strabo and other ancient writers; from them\nthe Athenians, the Syracusans, Tarentines and finally the Romans built\ntheir fleets. Their timber was used in the construction of Caserta palace.",
        "A house stands here, inhabited by government officials the whole year\nround–one may well puzzle how they pass the long winter, when snow lies\nfrom October to May. So early did I arrive at this establishment that\nthe more civilized of its inhabitants were still asleep; by waiting, I\nmight have learnt something of the management of the estate, but gross\nmaterial preoccupations–the prospect of a passable luncheon at San\nGiovanni after the “Hotel Vittoria” fare–tempted me to press forwards.\nA boorish and unreliable-looking individual volunteered three pieces of\ninformation–that the house was built thirty years ago, that a large\nnursery for plants lies about ten kilometres distant, and that this\nparticular domain covers “two or four thousand hectares.” A young\nplantation of larches and silver birches–aliens to this region–seemed\nto be doing well.",
        "Not far from here, along my track, lies Santa Barbara, two or three\nhuts, with corn still green–like Verace (above Acri) on the watershed\nbetween the Ionian and upper Grati. Then follows a steep climb up the\nslopes of Mount Pettinascura, whose summit lies 1708 metres above\nsea-level. This is the typical landscape of the Sila Grande. There is\nnot a human habitation in sight; forests all around, with views down\nmany-folded vales into the sea and towards the distant and fairy-like\nApennines, a serrated edge, whose limestone precipices gleam like\ncrystals of amethyst between the blue sky and the dusky woodlands of the\nforeground.",
        "Here I reposed awhile, watching the crossbills, wondrously tame, at work\namong the branches overhead, and the emerald lizard peering out of the\nbracken at my side. This lucertone, as they call it, is a local beast,\nvery abundant in some spots (at Venosa and Patirion, for example); it is\nelsewhere conspicuous by its absence. The natives are rather afraid of\nit, and still more so of the harmless gecko, the “salamide,” which is\nreputed highly poisonous.",
        "Then up again, through dells and over uplands, past bubbling streams,\nsometimes across sunlit meadows, but oftener in the leafy shelter of\nmaples and pines–a long but delightful track, winding always high above\nthe valleys of the Neto and Lese. At last, towards midday, I struck the\ndriving road that connects San Giovanni with Savelli, crossed a bridge\nover the foaming Neto, and climbed into the populous and dirty streets\nof the town–the “Siberia of Calabria,” as it may well be, for seven\nmonths of the year.",
        "At this season, thanks to its elevation of 1050 metres, the temperature\nis all that could be desired, and the hotel, such as it is, compares\nfavourably indeed with the den at Longobucco. Instantly I felt at home\namong these good people, who recognized me, and welcomed me with the\ncordiality of old friends.",
        "“Well,” they asked, “and have you found it at last?”",
        "They remembered my looking for the double flute, the tibiae pares,\nsome years ago.",
        "It will not take you long to discover that the chief objects of interest\nin San Giovanni are the women. Many Calabrian villages still possess\ntheir distinctive costumes–Marcellinara and Cimi-gliano are celebrated\nin this respect–but it would be difficult to find anywhere an equal\nnumber of handsome women on such a restricted space. In olden days it\nwas dangerous to approach these attractive and mirthful creatures; they\nwere jealously guarded by brothers and husbands. But the brothers and\nhusbands, thank God, are now in America, and you may be as friendly with\nthem as ever you please, provided you confine your serious attentions to\nnot more than two or three. Secrecy in such matters is out of the\nquestion, as with the Arabs; there is too much gossip, and too little\ncoyness about what is natural; your friendships are openly recognized,\nand tacitly approved. The priests do not interfere; their hands are full.",
        "To see these women at their best one must choose a Sunday or a\nfeast-day; one must go, morever, to the favourite fountain of Santa\nLucia, which lies on the hill-side and irrigates some patches of corn\nand vegetables. Their natural charms are enhanced by elaborate and\ntasteful golden ornaments, and by a pretty mode of dressing the hair,\ntwo curls of which are worn hanging down before their ears with an\nirresistibly seductive air. Their features are regular; eyes black or\ndeep gentian blue; complexion pale; movements and attitudes impressed\nwith a stamp of rare distinction. Even the great-grandmothers have a\ncertain austere dignity–sinewy, indestructible old witches, with tawny\nhide and eyes that glow like lamps.",
        "And yet San Giovanni is as dirty as can well be; it has the accumulated\nfilth of an Eastern town, while lacking all its glowing tints or\nharmonious outlines. We are disposed to associate squalor with certain\nartistic effects, but it may be said of this and many other Calabrian\nplaces that they have solved the problem how to be ineffably squalid\nwithout becoming in the least picturesque. Much of this sordid look is\ndue to the smoke which issues out of all the windows and blackens the\nhouse walls, inside and out–the Calabrians persisting in a prehistoric\nfashion of cooking on the floor. The buildings themselves look crude and\ngaunt from their lack of plaster and their eyeless windows; black pigs\nwallowing at every doorstep contribute to this slovenly ensemble. The\nCity Fathers have turned their backs upon civilization; I dare say the\nmagnitude of the task before them has paralysed their initiative.",
        "Nothing is done in the way of public hygiene, and one sees women washing\nlinen in water which is nothing more or less than an open drain. There\nis no street-lighting whatever; a proposal on the part of a North\nItalian firm to draw electric power from the Neto was scornfully\nrejected; one single tawdry lamp, which was bought some years ago “as a\nsample” in a moment of municipal recklessness, was lighted three times\nin as many years, and on the very day when it was least necessary–to\nwit, on midsummer eve, which happens to be the festival of their patron\nsaint (St. John). “It now hangs\"–so I wrote some years ago–\"at a\ndangerous angle, and I doubt whether it will survive till its services\nare requisitioned next June.” Prophetic utterance! It was blown down\nthat same winter, and has not yet been replaced. This in a town of\n20,000 (?) inhabitants–and in Italy, where the evening life of the\npopulace plays such an important role. No wonder North Italians, judging\nby such external indications, regard all Calabrians as savages.",
        "Some trees have been planted in the piazza since my last stay here; a\nnewspaper has also been started–it is called “Co-operation: Organ of\nthe Interests of San Giovanni in Fiore,” and its first and possibly\nunique number contains a striking article on the public health, as\nrevealed in the report of two doctors who had been despatched by the\nprovincial sanitary authorities to take note of local conditions of\nhygiene. “The illustrious scientists” (thus it runs) “were horrified at\nthe filth, mud and garbage which encumbered, and still encumbers, our\nstreets, sending forth in the warm weather a pestilential odour. . . .\nThey were likewise amazed at the vigorously expressed protest of our\nmayor, who said: ’My people cannot live’ without their pigs wallowing\nin the streets. San Giovanni in Fiore is exempt from earthquakes and\nepidemics because it is under the protection of Saint John the Baptist,\nand because its provincial councillor is a saintly man.’” Such\njournalistic plain speaking, such lack of sweet reasonableness, cannot\nexpect to survive in a world governed by compromise, and if the gift of\nprophecy has not deserted me, I should say that “Co-operation” has by\nthis time ended its useful mission upon earth.",
        "This place is unhealthy; its water-supply is not what it should be, and\nsuch commodities as eggs and milk are rather dear, because “the invalids\neat everything” of that kind. Who are the invalids? Typhoid patients\nand, above all, malarious subjects who descend to the plains as\nagricultural labourers and return infected to the hills, where they\nbecome partially cured, only to repeat the folly next year. It is the\nsame at Longobucco and other Sila towns. Altogether, San Giovanni has\ngrave drawbacks. The streets are too steep for comfort, and despite its\nheight, the prospect towards the Ionian is intercepted by a ridge; in\npoint of situation it cannot compare with Savelli or the neighbouring\nCasino, which have impressive views both inland, and southward down\nundulating slopes that descend in a stately procession of four thousand\nfeet to the sea, where sparkles the gleaming horn of Cotrone. And the\nsurroundings of the place are nowise representative of the Sila in a\ngood sense. The land has been so ruthlessly deforested that it has\nbecome a desert of naked granite rocks; even now, in midsummer, the\ncitizens are already collecting fuel for their long winter from enormous\ndistances. As one crawls and skips among these unsavoury tenements, one\ncannot help regretting that Saint John the Baptist, or the piety of a\nprovincial councillor, should have hindered the earthquakes from doing\ntheir obvious duty.",
        "Were I sultan of San Giovanni, I would certainly begin by a general\nbombardment. Little in the town is worth preserving from a cataclysm\nsave the women, and perhaps the old convent on the summit of the hill\nwhere the French lodged during their brigand-wars, and that other one,\nfamous in the ecclesiastical annals of Calabria–the monastery of\nFloriacense, founded at the end of the twelfth century, round which the\ntown gradually grew up. Its ponderous portal is much injured, having\nbeen burnt, I was told, by the brigands in 1860. But the notary, who\nkindly looked up the archives for me, has come to the conclusion that\nthe French are responsible for the damage. It contains, or contained, a\nfabulous collection of pious lumber–teeth and thigh-bones and other\nrelics, the catalogue of which is one of my favourite sections of Father\nFiore’s work. I would make an exception, also, in favour of the doorway\nof the church, a finely proportioned structure of the Renaissance in\nblack stone, which looks ill at ease among its ignoble environment. A\npriest, to whom I applied for information as to its history, told me\nwith the usual Calabrian frankness that he never bothered his head about\nsuch things.",
        "San Giovanni was practically unknown to the outside world up to a few\nyears ago. I question whether Lenormant or any of them came here.\nPacicchelli did, however, in the seventeenth century, though he has left\nus no description of the place. He crossed the whole Sila from the\nIonian to the other sea. I like this amiable and loquacious creature,\nrestlessly gadding about Europe, gloriously complacent, hopelessly,\nabsorbed in trivialities, and credulous beyond belief. In fact (as the\nreader may have observed), I like all these old travellers, not so much\nfor what they actually say, as for their implicit outlook upon life.\nThis Pacicchelli was a fellow of our Royal Society, and his accounts of\nEngland are worth reading; here, in Calabria (being a non-southerner)\nhis “Familiar Letters” and “Memoirs of Travel” act as a wholesome\ncorrective. Which of the local historians would have dared to speak of\nCosenza as “citta aperta, scomposta, e disordinata di fabbriche”?",
        "That these inhabitants of the Sila are Bruttians may be inferred from\nthe superior position occupied by their women-folk, who are quite\ndifferently treated to those of the lowlands. There–all along the\ncoasts of South Italy–the cow-woman is still found, unkempt and\nuncivilized; there, the male is the exclusive bearer of culture. Such\nthings are not seen among the Bruttians of the Sila, any more than among\nthe grave Latins or Samnites. These non-Hellenic races are, generally\nspeaking, honest, dignified and incurious; they are bigoted, not to say\nfanatical; and their women are not exclusively beasts of burden, being\nbetter dressed, better looking, and often as intelligent as the men.\nThey are the fruits of a female selection.",
        "But wherever the mocking Ionic spirit has penetrated–and the Ionian\nwomen occupied even a lower position than those of the Dorians and\nAeolians–it has resulted in a glorification of masculinity. Hand in\nhand with this depreciation of the female sex go other characteristics\nwhich point to Hellenic influences: lack of commercial morality, of\nveracity, of seriousness in religious matters; a persistent,\nlight-hearted inquisitiveness; a levity (or sprightliness, if you prefer\nit) of mind. The people are fetichistic, amulet-loving, rather than\ndevout. We may certainly suspect Greek or Saracen strains wherever women\nare held in low estimation; wherever, as the god Apollo himself said,\n\"the mother is but the nurse.” In the uplands of Calabria the mother is\na good deal more than the nurse.",
        "For the rest, it stands to reason that in proportion as the agricultural\nstage supplants that of pasturage, the superior strength and utility of\nboys over girls should become more apparent, and this in South Italy is\nuniversally proclaimed by the fact that everything large and fine is\nlaughingly described as “maschio” (male), and by some odd superstitions\nin disparagement of the female sex, such as these: that in giving\npresents to women, uneven numbers should be selected, lest even ones “do\nthem more good than they deserve\"; that to touch the hump of a female\nhunchback brings no luck whatever; that if a woman be the first to drink\nout of a new earthenware pitcher, the vessel may as well be thrown away\nat once–it is tainted for ever. [Footnote: In Japan, says Hearn, the\nfirst bucketful of water to be drawn out of a cleaned well must be drawn\nby a man; for if a womsn first draw water, the well will always\nhereafter remain muddy. Some of these prejudices seem to be based on\nprimordial misreadmgs of physiology. There is also a strong feeling in\nfavour of dark hair. No mother would entrust her infant to a fair\nwet-nurse; the milk even of white cows is considered “lymphatic” and not\nstrengthening; perhaps the eggs of white hens are equally devoid of the\nfortifying principle. There is something to be said for this since, in\nproportion as we go south, the risk of irritation, photophobia, and\nother com-plaints incidental to the xanthous complexion becomes\ngreater.] Yet the birth of a daughter is no Chinese calamity; even girls\nare “Christians” and welcomed as such, the populace having never sunk\nto the level of our theologians, who were wont to discuss an faemina\nsint monstra.",
        "All over the Sila there is a large preponderance of women over men,\nnearly the whole male section of the community, save the quite young and\nthe decrepit, being in America. This emigration brings much money into\nthe country and many new ideas; but the inhabitants have yet to learn\nthe proper use of their wealth, and to acquire a modern standard of\ncomfort. Together with the Sardinians, these Calabrians are the hardiest\nof native races, and this is what makes them prefer the strenuous but\nlucrative life in North American mines to the easier career in\nArgentina, which Neapolitans favour. There they learn English. They\nremember their families and the village that gave them birth, but their\npatriotism towards Casa Savoia is of the slenderest. How could it be\notherwise? I have spoken to numbers of them, and this is what they say:",
        "“This country has done nothing for us; why should we fight its battles?\nNot long ago we were almost devouring each other in our hunger; what did\nthey do to help us? If we have emerged from misery, it is due to our own\ninitiative and the work of our own hands; if we have decent clothes and\ndecent houses, it is because they drove us from our old homes with their\ninfamous misgovern-ment to seek work abroad.”",
        "Perfectly true! They have redeemed themselves, though the new regime has\nhardly had a fair trial. And the drawbacks of emigration (such as a\nslight increase of tuberculosis and alcoholism) are nothing compared\nwith the unprecedented material prosperity and enlightenment. There has\nalso been–in these parts, at all events–a marked diminution of crime.\nNo wonder, seeing that three-quarters of the most energetic and\nturbulent elements are at present in America, where they recruit the\nBlack Hand. That the Bruttian is not yet ripe for town life, that his\nvirtues are pastoral rather than civic, might have been expected; but\nthe Arab domination of much of his territory, one suspects, may have\ninfused fiercer strains into his character and helped to deserve for him\nthat epithet of sanguinario by which he is proud to be known.",
        "The last genuine bandit of the Sila was Gaetano Ricca. On account of\nsome trivial misunderstanding with the authorities, this man was\ncompelled in the early eighties to take to the woods, where he lived a\nwild life (alla campagna; alla macchia) for some three years. A price\nwas set on his head, but his daring and knowledge of the country\nintimidated every one. I should be sorry to believe in the number of\ncarbineers he is supposed to have killed during that period; no doubt\nthe truth came out during his subsequent trial. On one occasion he was\nsurrounded, and while the officer in command of his pursuers, who had\ntaken refuge behind a tree, ordered him to yield, Ricca waited patiently\ntill the point of his enemy’s foot became visible, when he pierced his\nankle-bone with his last bullet and escaped. He afterwards surrendered\nand was imprisoned for twenty years or so; then returned to the Sila,\nwhere up to a short time ago he was enjoying a green old age in his home\nat Parenti–Parenti, already celebrated in the annals of brigandage by\nthe exploit of the perfidious Francatripa (Giacomo Pisani), who, under\npretence of hospitality, enticed a French company into his clutches and\nmurdered its three officers and all the men, save seven. The memoirs of\nsuch men might be as interesting as those of the Sardinian Giovanni Tolu\nwhich have been printed. I would certainly have paid my respects to\nRicca had I been aware of his existence when, some years back, I passed\nthrough Parenti on my way–a long day’s march!–from Rogliano to San\nGiovanni. He has died in the interval.",
        "But the case of Ricca is a sporadic one, such as may crop up anywhere\nand at any time. It is like that of Musolino–the case of an isolated\noutlaw, who finds the perplexed geographical configuration of the\ncountry convenient for offensive and defensive purposes. Calabrian\nbrigandage, as a whole, has always worn a political character.",
        "The men who gave the French so much trouble were political brigands,\nallies of Bourbonism. They were commanded by creatures like Mammone, an\nanthropophagous monster whose boast it was that he had personally killed\n455 persons with the greatest refinements of cruelty, and who wore at\nhis belt the skull of one of them, out of which he used to drink human\nblood at mealtime; he drank his own blood as well; indeed, he “never\ndined without having a bleeding human heart on the table.” This was the\nman whom King Ferdinand and his spouse loaded with gifts and\ndecorations, and addressed as “Our good Friend and General–the\nfaithful Support of the Throne.” The numbers of these savages were\nincreased by shiploads of professional cut-throats sent over from Sicily\nby the English to help their Bourbon friends. Some of these actually\nwore the British uniform; one of the most ferocious was known as\n\"L’Inglese\"–the Englishman.",
        "One must go to the fountain-head, to the archives, in order to gain some\nidea of the sanguinary anarchy that desolated South Italy in those days.\nThe horrors of feudalism, aided by the earthquake of 1784 and by the\neffects of Cardinal Ruffo’s Holy Crusade, had converted the country into\na pandemonium. In a single year (1809) thirty-three thousand crimes were\nrecorded against the brigands of the Kingdom of Naples; in a single\nmonth they are said to have committed 1200 murders in Calabria alone.\nThese were the bands who were described by British officers as “our\nchivalrous brigand-allies.”",
        "It is good to bear these facts in mind when judging of the present state\nof this province, for the traces of such a reign of terror are not\neasily expunged. Good, also, to remember that this was the period of the\nhighest spiritual eminence to which South Italy has ever attained. Its\npopulation of four million inhabitants were then consoled by the\npresence of no less than 120,000 holy persons–to wit, 22 archbishops,\n116 bishops, 65,500 ordained priests, 31,800 monks, and 23,600 nuns.\nSome of these ecclesiastics, like the Bishop of Capaccio, were notable\nbrigand-chiefs.",
        "It must be confessed that the French were sufficiently coldblooded in\ntheir reprisals. Colletta himself saw, at Lagonegro, a man impaled by\norder of a French colonel; and some account of their excesses may be\ngleaned from Duret de Tavel, from Rivarol (rather a disappointing\nauthor), and from the flamboyant epistles of P. L. Courier, a\nsoldier-scribe of rare charm, who lost everything in this campaign.\n\"J’ai perdu huit chevaux, mes habits, mon linge, mon manteau, mes\npistolets, mon argent (12,247 francs). . . . Je ne regrette que mon\nHomere (a gift from the Abbe Barthelemy), et pour le ravoir, je\ndonnerais la seule chemise qui me reste.”",
        "But even that did not destroy the plague. The situation called for a\ngenial and ruthless annihilator, a man like Sixtus V, who asked for\nbrigands’ heads and got them so plentifully that they lay “thick as\nmelons in the market” under the walls of Rome, while the Castel Sant’\nAngelo was tricked out like a Christmas tree with quartered corpses–a\nman who told the authorities, when they complained of the insufferable\nstench of the dead, that the smell of living iniquity was far worse.\nSuch a man was wanted. Therefore, in 1810, Murat gave carte blanche\nto General Manhes, the greatest brigand-catcher of modern times, to\nextirpate the ruffians, root and branch. He had just distinguished\nhimself during a similar errand in the Abruzzi and, on arriving in\nCalabria, issued proclamations of such inhuman severity that the\ninhabitants looked upon them as a joke. They were quickly undeceived.\nThe general seems to have considered that the end justified the means,\nand that the peace and happiness of a province was not to be disturbed\nyear after year by the malignity of a few thousand rascals; his threats\nwere carried out to the letter, and, whatever may be said against his\nmethods, he certainly succeeded. At the end of a few months’ campaign,\nevery single brigand, and all their friends and relations, were wiped\noff the face of the earth–together with a very considerable number of\ninnocent persons. The high roads were lined with decapitated bandits,\nthe town walls decked with their heads; some villages had to be\nabandoned, on account of the stench; the Crati river was swollen with\ncorpses, and its banks whitened with bones. God alone knows the\ncruelties which were enacted; Colletta confesses that he “lacks courage\nto relate them.” Here is his account of the fate of the brigand chief\nBenincasa:",
        "“Betrayed and bound by his followers as he slept in the forest of\nCassano, Benincasa was brought to Cosenza, and General Manhes ordered\nthat both his hands be lopped off and that he be led, thus mutilated, to\nhis home in San Giovanni, and there hanged; a cruel sentence, which the\nwretch received with a bitter smile. His right hand was first cut off\nand the stump bound, not out of compassion or regard for his life, but\nin order that all his blood might not flow out of the opened veins,\nseeing that he was reserved for a more miserable death. Not a cry\nescaped him, and when he saw that the first operation was over, he\nvoluntarily laid his left hand upon the block and coldly watched the\nsecond mutilation, and saw his two amputated hands lying on the ground,\nwhich were then tied together by the thumbs and hung round his neck; an\nawful and piteous spectacle. This happened at Cosenza. On the same day\nhe began his march to San Giovanni in Fiore, the escort resting at\nintervals; one of them offered the man food, which he accepted;\nhe ate and drank what was placed in his mouth, and not so much in order\nto sustain life, as with real pleasure. He arrived at his home, and\nslept through the following night; on the next day, as the hour of\nexecution approached, he refused the comforts of religion, ascended the\ngallows neither swiftly nor slowly, and died admired for his brutal\nintrepidity.” [Footnote: This particular incident was flatly denied by\nManhes in a letter dated 1835, which is   quoted in the “Notizia storica\ndel Conte C. A. Manhes” (Naples, 1846)–one of a considerable number of\npro-Bourbon books that cropped up about this time. One is apt to have\nquite a wrong impression of Manhes, that inexorable but incorruptible\nscourge of evildoers. One pictures him a grey-haired veteran, scarred\nand gloomy; and learns, on the contrary, that he was only thirty-two\nyears old at this time, gracious in manner and of surprising personal\nbeauty.]",
        "For the first time since long Calabria was purged. Ever since the\nBruttians, irreclaimable plunderers, had established themselves at\nCosenza, disquieting their old Hellenic neighbours, the recesses of this\ncountry had been a favourite retreat of political malcontents. Here\nSpartacus drew recruits for his band of rebels; here “King Marcene\"\ndefied the oppressive Spanish Viceroys, and I blame neither him nor his\nimitators, since the career of bandit was one of the very few that still\ncommended itself to decent folks, under that regime.",
        "During the interregnum of Bourbonism between Murat and Garibaldi the\nmischief revived–again in a political form. Brigands drew pensions from\nkings and popes, and the system gave rise to the most comical incidents;\nthe story of the pensioned malefactors living together at Monticello\nreads like an extravaganza. It was the spirit of Offenbach, brooding\nover Europe. One of the funniest episodes was a visit paid in 1865 by\nthe disconsolate Mrs. Moens to the ex-brigand Talarico, who was then\nliving in grand style on a government pension. Her husband had been\ncaptured by the band of Manzi (another brigand), and expected to be\nmurdered every day, and the lady succeeded in procuring from the\nchivalrous monster–\"an extremely handsome man, very tall, with the\nsmallest and most delicate hands\"–an exquisite letter to his colleague,\nrecommending him to be merciful to the Englishman and to emulate his own\nconduct in that respect. The letter had no effect, apparently; but Moens\nescaped at last, and wrote his memoirs, while Manzi was caught and\nexecuted in 1868 after a trial occupying nearly a month, during which\nthe jury had to answer 311 questions.",
        "His villainies were manifold. But they were put in the shade by those of\nothers of his calling–of Caruso, for example, who was known to have\nmassacred in one month (September, 1863) two hundred persons with his\nown hands. Then, as formerly, the Church favoured the malefactors, and I\nam personally acquainted with priests who fought on the side of the\nbrigands. Francis II endeavoured to retrieve his kingdom by the help of\nan army of scoundrels like those of Ruffo, but the troops shot them\ndown. Brigandage, as a governmental institution, came to an end.\nUnquestionably the noblest figure in this reactionary movement was that\nof Jose Borjes, a brave man engaged in an unworthy cause. You can read\nhis tragic journal in the pages of M. Monnier or Maffei. It has been\ncalculated that during these last years of Bourbonism the brigands\ncommitted seven thousand homicides a year in the kingdom of Naples.",
        "Schools and emigration have now brought sounder ideas among the people,\nand the secularization of convents with the abolition of ecclesiastical\nright of asylum (Sixtus V had wisely done away with it) has broken up\nthe prosperous old bond between monks and malefactors. What the\ngovernment has done towards establishing decent communications in this\nonce lawless and pathless country ranks, in its small way, beside the\nachievement of the French who, in Algeria, have built nearly ten\nthousand miles of road. But it is well to note that even as the\nmechanical appliance of steam destroyed the corsairs, the external\nplague, so this hoary form of internal disorder could have been\npermanently eradicated neither by humanity nor by severity. A scientific\ninvention, the electric telegraph, is the guarantee of peace against the\nrascals.",
        "These brigand chiefs were often loaded with gold. On killing them, the\nfirst thing the French used to do was to strip them. “On le depouilla.\"\nFrancatripa, for instance, possessed “a plume of white ostrich feathers,\nclasped by a golden band and diamond Madonna” (a gift from Queen\nCaroline)–Cerino and Manzi had “bunches of gold chains as thick as an\narm suspended across the breasts of their waistcoats, with gorgeous\nbrooches at each fastening.” Some of their wealth now survives in\ncertain families who gave them shelter in the towns in winter time, or\nwhen they were hard pressed. These favoreggiatori or manutengoli\n(the terms are interconvertible, but the first is the legal one) were\nsometimes benevolently inclined. But occasionally they conceived the\nhappy idea of being paid for their silence and services. The brigand,\nthen, was hoist with his own petard and forced to disgorge his\nill-gotten summer gains to these blood-suckers, who extorted heavy\nblackmail under menaces of disclosure to the police, thriving on their\ndouble infamy to such an extent that they acquired immense riches. One\nof the wealthiest men in Italy descends from this class; his two hundred\nmillion (?) francs are invested, mostly, in England; every one knows his\nname, but the origin of his fortune is no longer mentioned, since\n(thanks to this money) the family has been able to acquire not only\nrespectability but distinction.",
        "A great project is afoot. As I understand it, a reservoir is being\ncreated by damming up the valley of the Ampollina; the artificial lake\nthus formed will be enlarged by the additional waters of the Arvo, which\nare to be led into it by means of a tunnel, about three miles long,\npassing underneath Monte Nero. The basin, they tell me, will be some ten\nkilometres in length; the work will cost forty million francs, and will\nbe completed in a couple of years; it will supply the Ionian lowlands\nwith pure water and with power for electric and other industries.",
        "And more than that. The lake is to revolutionize the Sila; to convert\nthese wildernesses into a fashionable watering-place. Enthusiasts\nalready see towns growing upon its shores–there are visions of gorgeous\nhotels and flocks of summer visitors in elegant toilettes,\nvilla-residences, funicular railways up all the mountains, sailing\nregattas, and motor-boat services. In the place of the desert there will\narise a “Lucerna di Calabria.”",
        "A Calabrian Lucerne. H’m. ...",
        "It remains to be seen whether, by the time the lake is completed, there\nwill be any water left to flow into it. For the catchment basins are\nbeing so conscientiously cleared of their timber that the two rivers\ncannot but suffer a great diminution in volume. By 1896 already, says\nMarincola San Fioro, the destruction of woodlands in the Sila had\nresulted in a notable lack of moisture. Ever since then the vandalism\nhas been pursued with a zeal worthy of a better cause. One trembles to\nthink what these regions will be like in fifty years; a treeless and\nwaterless tableland–worse than the glaring limestone deserts of the\nApennines in so far as they, at least, are diversified in contour.",
        "So the healthfulness, beauty, and exchequer value of enormous tracts in\nthis country are being systematically impaired, day by day. Italy is\nready, said D’Azeglio, but where are the Italians?",
        "Let us give the government credit for any number of good ideas. It\nactually plants bare spaces; it has instituted a “Festa degli alberi\"\nakin to the American Arbour Day, whereby it is hoped, though scarcely\nbelieved, that the whole of Italy will ultimately be replenished with\ntrees; it encourages schools of forestry, supplies plants free of cost\nto all who ask for them, despatches commissions and prints reports.\nAbove all, it talks prodigiously and very much to the purpose.",
        "But it omits to administer its own laws with becoming severity. A few\nexemplary fines and imprisonments would have a more salutary effect than\nthe commissioning of a thousand inspectors whom nobody takes seriously,\nand the printing of ten thousand reports which nobody reads.",
        "With a single stroke of the pen the municipalities could put an end to\nthe worst form of forest extirpation–that on the hill-sides–by\nforbidding access to such tracts and placing them under the “vincolo\nforestale.” To denude slopes in the moist climate and deep soil of\nEngland entails no risk; in this country it is the beginning of the end.\nAnd herein lies the ineptitude of the Italian regulations, which entrust\nthe collective wisdom of rapacious farmers with measures of this kind,\ntaking no account of the destructively utilitarian character of the\nnative mind, of that canni-ness which overlooks a distant profit in its\neagerness to grasp the present–that beast avarice which Horace\nrecognized as the root of all evil. As if provisions like this of the\n\"vincolo forestale” were ever carried out! Peasants naturally prefer to\nburn the wood in their own chimneys or to sell it; and if a landslide\nthen crashes down, wrecking houses and vineyards–let the government\ncompensate the victims!",
        "An ounce of fact–",
        "In one year alone (1903), and in the sole province of Cosenza wherein\nSan Giovanni lies, there were 156 landslides; they destroyed 1940\nhectares of land, and their damage amounted to 432,738 francs. The two\nother Calabrian provinces–Reggio and Catanzaro–doubtless also had\ntheir full quota of these catastrophes, all due to mischievous\ndeforestation. So the bare rock is exposed, and every hope of planting\nat an end.",
        "Vox clamantis! The Normans, Anjou and Aragonese concerned themselves\nwith the proper administration of woodlands. Even the Spanish Viceroys,\nthat ineffable brood, issued rigorous enactments on the subject; while\nthe Bourbons (to give the devil his due) actually distinguished\nthemselves as conservators of forests. As to Napoleon–he was busy\nenough, one would think, on this side of the Alps. Yet he found time to\nframe wise regulations concerning trees which the present patriotic\nparliament, during half a century of frenzied confabulation, has not yet\ntaken to heart.",
        "How a great man will leave his mark on minutiae!",
        "I passed through the basin of this future lake when, in accordance with\nmy project, I left San Giovanni to cross the remaining Sila in the\ndirection of Catanzaro. This getting up at 3.30 a.m., by the way, rather\nupsets one’s daily routine; at breakfast time I already find myself\nenquiring anxiously for dinner.",
        "The Ampollina valley lies high; here, in the dewy grass, I enjoyed what\nI well knew would be my last shiver for some time to come; then moved\nfor a few miles on the further bank of the rivulet along that driving\nroad which will soon be submerged under the waters of the lake, and\nstruck up a wooded glen called Barbarano. At its head lies the upland\nCircilla.",
        "There is no rock scenery worth mentioning in all this Sila country; no\nwaterfalls or other Alpine features. It is a venerable granitic\ntableland, that has stood here while the proud Apennines were still\nslumbering in the oozy bed of ocean–[Footnote: Nissen says that “no\nlandscape of Italy has lost so little of its original appearance in the\ncourse of history as Calabria.” This may apply to the mountains; but the\nlowlands have suffered hideous changes.] a region of gentle undulations,\nthe hill-tops covered with forest-growth, the valleys partly arable and\npartly pasture. Were it not for the absence of heather with its peculiar\nmauve tints, the traveller might well imagine himself in Scotland. There\nis the same smiling alternation of woodland and meadow, the same huge\nboulders of gneiss and granite which give a distinctive tone to the\nlandscape, the same exuberance of living waters. Water, indeed, is one\nof the glories of the Sila–everywhere it bubbles forth in chill\nrivulets among the stones and trickles down the hill-sides to join the\nlarger streams that wend their way to the forlorn and fever-stricken\ncoastlands of Magna Graecia. Often, as I refreshed myself at these icy\nfountains, did I thank Providence for making the Sila of primitive rock,\nand not of the thirsty Apennine limestone.",
        "“Much water in the Sila,” an old shepherd once observed to me, “much\nwater! And little tobacco.”",
        "One of the largest of these rivers is the Neto, the classic Neaithos\nsung by Theocritus, which falls into the sea north of Cotrone; San\nGiovanni overlooks its raging flood, and, with the help of a little\nimagination here and there, its whole course can be traced from\neminences like that of Pettinascura. The very name of these\nstreams–Neto, Arvo, Lese, Ampollina–are redolent of pastoral life. All\nof them are stocked with trout; they meander in their upper reaches\nthrough valleys grazed by far-tinkling flocks of sheep and goats and\ngrey cattle–the experiment of acclimatizing Swiss cattle has proved a\nfailure, I know not why–and their banks are brilliant with blossoms.\nLater on, in the autumn, the thistles begin to predominate–the finest\nof them being a noble ground thistle of pale gold, of which they eat the\nunopened bud; it is the counterpart of the silvery one of the Alps. The\nair in these upper regions is keen. I remember, some years ago, that\nduring the last week of August a lump of snow, which a goat-boy produced\nas his contribution to our luncheon, did not melt in the bright sunshine\non the summit of Monte Nero.",
        "From whichever side one climbs out of the surrounding lowlands into the\nSila plateau, the same succession of trees is encountered. To the\nwarmest zone of olives, lemons and carobs succeeds that of the\nchestnuts, some of them of gigantic dimensions and yielding a sure\nthough moderate return in fruit, others cut down periodically as coppice\nfor vine-props and scaffoldings. Large tracts of these old chestnut\ngroves are now doomed; a French society in Cosenza, so they tell me, is\nbuying them up for the extraction out of their bark of some chemical or\nmedicine. The vine still flourishes at this height, though dwarfed in\nsize; soon the oaks begin to dominate, and after that we enter into the\nthird and highest region cf the pines and beeches. Those accustomed to\nthe stony deserts of nearly all South European mountain districts will\nfind these woodlands intensely refreshing. Their inaccessibility has\nproved their salvation–up to a short time ago.",
        "Nearly all the cattle on the Sila, like the land itself, belongs to\nlarge proprietors. These gentlemen are for the most part invisible; they\ninhabit their palaces in the cities, and the very name of the Sila sends\na cold shudder through their bones; their revenues are collected from\nthe shepherds by agents who seem to do their work very conscientiously.\nI once observed, in a hut, a small fragment of the skin of a newly\nkilled kid; the wolf had devoured the beast, and the shepherd was\nkeeping this corpus delicti to prove to his superior, the agent, that\nhe was innocent of the murder. There was something naive in his\nhonesty–as if a shepherd could not eat a kid as well as any wolf, and\nkeep a portion of its skin! The agent, no doubt, would hand it on to his\nlord, by way of confirmation and verification. Another time I saw the\ndebris of a goat hanging from a tree; it was the wolf again; the boy had\nattached these remains to the tree in order that all who passed that way\nmight be his witnesses, if necessary, that the animal had not been sold\nunderhand.",
        "You may still find the legendary shepherds here–curly-haired\nstriplings, reclining sub tegmine fagi in the best Theocritean style,\nand piping wondrous melodies to their flocks. These have generally come\nup for the summer season from the Ionian lowlands. Or you may encounter\nyet more primitive creatures, forest boys, clad in leather, with wild\neyes and matted locks, that take an elvish delight in misdirecting you.\nThese are the Lucanians of old. “They bring them up from childhood in\nthe woods among the shepherds,” says Justinus, “without servants, and\neven without any clothes to cover them, or to lie upon, that from their\nearly years they may become inured to hardiness and frugality, and have\nno intercourse with the city. They live upon game, and drink nothing but\nwater or milk.” But the majority of modern Sila shepherds are shrewd\nfellows of middle age (many of them have been to America), who keep\nstrict business accounts for their masters of every ounce of cheese and\nbutter produced. The local cheese, which Cassiodorus praises in one of\nhis letters, is the cacciacavallo common all over South Italy; the\nbutter is of the kind which has been humorously, but quite wrongly,\ndescribed by various travellers.",
        "Although the old wolves are shot and killed by spring guns and dynamite\nwhile the young ones are caught alive in steel traps and other\nappliances, their numbers are still formidable enough to perturb the\npastoral folks. One is therefore surprised to see what a poor breed of\ndogs they keep; scraggy mongrels that run for their lives at the mere\nsight of a wolf who can, and often does, bite them into two pieces with\none snap of his jaws. They tell me that there is a government reward for\nevery wolf killed, but it is seldom paid; whoever has the good fortune\nto slay one of these beasts, carries the skin as proof of his prowess\nfrom door to door, and receives a small present everywhere–half a\nfranc, or a cheese, or a glass of wine.",
        "The goats show fight, and therefore the wolf prefers sheep. Shepherds\nhave told me that he comes up to them delicatamente, and then, fixing\nhis teeth in the wool of their necks, pulls them onward, caressing their\nsides with his tail. The sheep are fascinated with his gentle manners,\nand generally allow themselves to be led up to the spot he has selected\nfor their execution; the truth being that he is too lazy to carry them,\nif he can possibly avoid it.",
        "He will promptly kill his quarry and carry its carcase downhill on the\nrare occasions when the flocks are grazing above his haunt; but if it is\nan uphill walk, they must be good enough to use their own legs.\nIncredible stories of his destructiveness are related.",
        "Fortunately, human beings are seldom attacked, a dog or a pig being\ngenerally forthcoming when the usual prey is not to be found. Yet not\nlong ago a sad affair occurred; a she-wolf attacked a small boy before\nthe eyes of his parents, who pursued him, powerless to help–the head\nand arms had already been torn off before a shot from a neighbour\ndespatched the monster. Truly, “a great family displeasure,” as my\ninformant styled it. Milo of Croton, the famous athlete, is the most\nrenowned victim of these Sila wolves. Tradition has it that, relying on\nhis great strength, he tried to rend asunder a mighty log of wood which\nclosed, however, and caught his arms in its grip; thus helpless, he was\ndevoured alive by them.",
        "By keeping to the left of Circilla, I might have skirted the forest of\nGariglione. This tract lies at about four and a half hours’ distance\nfrom San Giovanni; I found it, some years ago, to be a region of real\n\"Urwald” or primary jungle; there was nothing like it, to my knowledge,\non this side of the Alps, nor yet in the Alps themselves; nothing of the\nkind nearer than Russia. But the Russian jungles, apart from their\nmonotony of timber, foster feelings of sadness and gloom, whereas these\nsouthern ones, as Hehn has well observed, are full of a luminous\nbeauty–their darkest recesses being enlivened by a sense of benignant\nmystery. Gariglione was at that time a virgin forest, untouched by the\nhand of man; a dusky ridge, visible from afar; an impenetrable tangle of\nforest trees, chiefest among them being the “garigli” (Quercus cerris)\nwhence it derives its name, as well as thousands of pines and bearded\nfirs and all that hoary indigenous vegetation struggling out of the\nmoist soil wherein their progenitors had lain decaying time out of mind.\nIn these solitudes, if anywhere, one might still have found the\nabsent-minded luzard (lynx) of the veracious historian; or that squirrel\nwhose “calabrere” fur, I strongly suspect, came from Russia; or, at any\nrate, the Mushroom-stone which shineth in the night. [Footnote: As a\nmatter of fact, the mushroom-stone is a well-known commodity, being\nstill collected and eaten, for example, at Santo Stefano in Aspramente.\nOlder travellers tell us that it used to be exported to Naples and kept\nin the cellars of the best houses for the enjoyment of its\nfruit–sometimes in lumps measuring two feet in diameter which, being\nsoaked in water, produced these edible fungi. A stone yielding food–a\nmiracle! It is a porous tufa adapted, presumably, for sheltering and\nfecundating vegetable spores. A little pamphlet by Professor A. Trotter\n(\"Flora Montana della Calabria”) gives some idea of the local plants and\ncontains a useful bibliography. A curious feature is the relative\nabundance of boreal and Balkan-Oriental forms; another, the rapid spread\nof Genista anglica, which is probably an importation.]",
        "Well, I am glad my path to-day did not lead me to Gariglione, and so\ndestroy old memories of the place. For the domain, they tell me, has\nbeen sold for 350,000 francs to a German company; its primeval silence\nis now invaded by an army of 260 workmen, who have been cutting down the\ntimber as fast as they can. So vanishes another fair spot from earth!\nAnd what is left of the Sila, once these forests are gone? Not even the\ncharm, such as it is, of Caithness. . . .",
        "After Circilla comes the watershed that separates the Sila Grande from\nthe westerly regions of Sila Piccola. Thenceforward it was downhill\nwalking, at first through forest lands, then across verdant stretches,\nbereft of timber and simmering in the sunshine. The peculiar character\nof this country is soon revealed–ferociously cloven ravines, utterly\ndifferent from the Sila Grande.",
        "With the improvidence of the true traveller I had consumed my stock of\nprovisions ere reaching the town of Taverna after a march of nine hours\nor thereabouts. A place of this size and renown, I had argued, would\nsurely be able to provide a meal. But Taverna belies its name. The only\ntavern discoverable was a composite hovel, half wine-shop, half\nhen-house, whose proprietor, disturbed in his noonday nap, stoutly\nrefused to produce anything eatable. And there I stood in the blazing\nsunshine, famished and un-befriended. Forthwith the strength melted out\nof my bones; the prospect of walking to Catanzaro, so alluring with a\nfull stomach, faded out of the realm of possibility; and it seemed a\nspecial dispensation of Providence when, at my lowest ebb of vitality, a\nsmall carriage suddenly hove in sight.",
        "“How much to Catanzaro?”",
        "The owner eyed me critically, and then replied in English:",
        "“You can pay twenty dollars.”",
        "Twenty dollars–a hundred francs! But it is useless trying to bargain\nwith an americano (their time is too valuable).",
        "“A dollar a mile?” I protested.",
        "“That’s so.”",
        "“You be damned.”",
        "“Same to you, mister.” And he drove off.",
        "Such bold defiance of fate never goes unrewarded. A two-wheeled cart\nconveying some timber overtook me shortly afterwards on my way from the\ninhospitable Taverna. For a small consideration I was enabled to pass\nthe burning hours of the afternoon in an improvised couch among its load\nof boards, admiring the scenery and the engineering feats that have\ncarried a road through such difficult country, and thinking out some\nfurther polite remarks to be addressed to my twenty-dollar friend, in\nthe event of our meeting at Catanzaro. . . .",
        "One must have traversed the Sila in order to appreciate the manifold\ncharms of the mountain town–I have revelled in them since my arrival.\nBut it has one irremediable drawback: the sea lies at an inconvenient\ndistance. It takes forty-five minutes to reach the shore by means of two\nrailways in whose carriages the citizens descend after wild scrambles\nfor places, packed tight as sardines in the sweltering heat. Only a\ngenuine enthusiast will undertake the trip more than once. For the\nMarina itself–at this season, at least–is an unappetizing spot; a\nsordid agglomeration of houses, a few dirty fruit-stalls, ankle-deep\ndust, swarms of flies. I prefer to sleep through the warm hours of the\nday, and then take the air in that delightful public garden which, by\nthe way, has already become too small for the increasing population.",
        "At its entrance stands the civic museum, entrusted, just now, to the\ncare of a quite remarkably ignorant and slatternly woman. It contains\ntwo rooms, whose exhibits are smothered in dust and cobwebs; as\nneglected, in short, as her own brats that sprawl about its floor. I\nenquired whether she possessed no catalogue to show where the objects,\nbearing no labels, had been found. A catalogue was unnecessary, she\nsaid; she knew everything–everything!",
        "And everything, apparently, hailed from “Stromboli.” The Tiriolo helmet,\nthe Greek vases, all the rest of the real and sham treasures of this\nestablishment: they were all discovered at Stromboli.",
        "“Those coins–whence?”",
        "“Stromboli!”",
        "Noticing some neolithic celts similar to those I obtained at Vaccarizza,\nI would gladly have learnt their place of origin. Promptly came the answer:",
        "“Stromboli!”",
        "“Nonsense, my good woman. I’ve been three times to Stromboli; it is an\nisland of black stones where the devil has a house, and such things are\nnot found there.” (Of course she meant Strangoli, the ancient Petelia.)",
        "This vigorous assertion made her more circumspect. Thenceforward\neverything was declared to come from the province–dalla provincia; it\nwas safer.",
        "“That bad picture–whence?”",
        "“Dalla provincia!”",
        "“Have you really no catalogue?”",
        "“I know everything.”",
        "“And this broken statue–whence?”",
        "“Dalla provincia!”",
        "“But the province is large,” I objected.",
        "“So it is. Large, and old.”",
        "I have also revisited Tiriolo, once celebrated for the “Sepulchres of\nthe Giants” (Greek tombs) that were unearthed here, and latterly for a\ncertain more valuable antiquarian discovery. Not long ago it was a\nconsiderable undertaking to reach this little place, but nowadays a\npublic motor-car whirls you up and down the ravines at an alarming pace\nand will deposit you, within a few hours, at remote Cosenza, once an\nenormous drive. It is the same all over modern Calabria. The diligence\nservice, for instance, that used to take fourteen hours from San\nGiovanni to Cosenza has been replaced by motors that cover the distance\nin four or five. One is glad to save time, but this new element of\nmechanical hurry has produced a corresponding kind of traveller–a\nmachine-made creature, devoid of the humanity of the old; it has done\naway with the personal note of conviviality that reigned in the\npost-carriages. What jocund friendships were made, what songs and tales\napplauded, during those interminable hours in the lumbering chaise!",
        "You must choose Sunday for Tiriolo, on account of the girls, whose\npretty faces and costumes are worth coming any distance to see. A good\nproportion of them have the fair hair which seems to have been\neliminated, in other parts of the country, through the action of malaria.",
        "Viewed from Catanzaro, one of the hills of Tiriolo looks like a broken\nvolcanic crater. It is a limestone ridge, decked with those\ncharacteristic flowers like Campanula fragilis which you will vainly\nseek on the Sila. Out of the ruins of some massive old building they\nhave constructed, on the summit, a lonely weather-beaten fabric that\nwould touch the heart of Maeterlinck. They call it a seismological\nstation. I pity the people that have to depend for their warnings of\nearthquakes upon the outfit of a place like this. I could see no signs\nof life here; the windows were broken, the shutters decaying, an old\nlightning-rod dangled disconsolately from the roof; it looked as\nabandoned as any old tower in a tale. There is a noble view from this\npoint over both seas and into the riven complexities of Aspromonte, when\nthe peak is not veiled in mists, as it frequently is. For Tiriolo lies\non the watershed; there (to quote from a “Person of Quality “) “where\nthe Apennine is drawn into so narrow a point, that the rain-water which\ndescendeth from the ridge of some one house, falleth on the left in the\nTerrene Sea, and on the right into the Adriatick. . . .”",
        "My visits to the provincial museum have become scandalously frequent\nduring the last few days. I cannot keep away from the place. I go there\nnot to study the specimens but to converse with their keeper, the woman\nwho, in her quiet way, has cast a sort of charm over me. Our relations\nare the whispered talk of the town; I am suspected of matrimonial\ndesigns upon a poor widow with the ulterior object of appropriating the\ncream of the relics under her care. Regardless of the perils of the\nsituation, I persevere; for the sake of her company I forswear the\nmanifold seductions of Catan-zaro. She is a noteworthy person, neither\nvicious nor vulgar, but simply the dernier mot of incompetence. Her\ndress, her looks, her children, her manners–they are all on an even\nplane with her spiritual accomplishments; at no point does she sink, or\nrise, beyond that level. They are not as common as they seem to be,\nthese harmoniously inefficient females.",
        "Why has she got this job in a progressive town containing so many folks\nwho could do it creditably? Oh, that is simple enough! She needs it. On\nthe platform of the Reggio station (long before the earthquake) I once\ncounted five station-masters and forty-eight other railway officials,\nswaggering about with a magnificent air of incapacity. What were they\ndoing? Nothing whatever. They were like this woman: they needed a job.",
        "We are in a patriarchal country; work is pooled; it is given not to\nthose who can do it best, but to those who need it most–given, too, on\npretexts which sometimes strike one as inadequate, not to say recondite.\nSo the street-scavengering in a certain village has been entrusted to a\none-armed cripple, utterly unfit for the business–why? Because his\nmaternal grand-uncle is serving a long sentence in gaol. The poor family\nmust be helped! A brawny young fellow will be removed from a\nlanding-stage boat, and his place taken by some tottering old peasant\nwho has never handled an oar–why? The old man’s nephew has married\nagain; the family must be helped. A secretarial appointment was\nspecially created for an acquaintance of mine who could barely sign his\nown name, for the obvious reason that his cousin’s sister was rheumatic.\nOne must help that family.",
        "A postman whom I knew delivered the letters only once every three days,\nalleging, as unanswerable argument in his defence, that his brother’s\nwife had fifteen children.",
        "One must help that family!",
        "Somebody seems to have thought so, at all events.",
        "I have never beheld the enchantment of the Straits of Messina, that Fata\nMorgana, when, under certain conditions of weather, phantasmagoric\npalaces of wondrous shape are cast upon the waters–not mirrored, but\nstanding upright; tangible, as it were; yet diaphanous as a veil of gauze.",
        "A Dominican monk and correspondent of the Naples Academy, Minasi by\nname, friend of Sir W. Hamilton, wrote a dissertation upon this\natmospheric mockery. Many have seen and described it, among them Filati\nde Tassulo; Nicola Leoni reproduces the narrative of an eye-witness\nof 1643; another account appears in the book of A. Fortis\n(\"Mineralogische Reisen, 1788”). The apparition is coy. Yet there are\npictures of it–in an article in “La Lettura” by Dr. Vittorio Boccara,\nwho therein refers to a scientific treatise by himself on the subject,\nas well as in the little volume “Da Reggio a Metaponto” by Lupi-Crisafi,\nwhich was printed at Gerace some years ago. I mention these writers for\nthe sake of any one who, luckier than myself, may be able to observe\nthis phenomenon and become interested in its history and origin. . . .",
        "The chronicles of Messina record the scarcely human feats of the diver\nCola Pesce (Nicholas the Fish). The dim submarine landscapes of the\nStraits with their caves and tangled forests held no secrets from him;\nhis eyes were as familiar with sea-mysteries as those of any fish. Some\nthink that the legend dates from Frederick II, to whom he brought up\nfrom the foaming gulf that golden goblet which has been immortalized in\nSchiller’s ballad. But Schneegans says there are Norman documents that\nspeak of him. And that other tale, according to which he took to his\nwatery life in pursuit of some beloved maiden who had been swallowed by\nthe waves, makes one think of old Glaucus as his prototype.",
        "Many are the fables connected with his name, but the most portentous is\nthis: One day, during his subaqueous wanderings, he discovered the\nfoundations of Messina. They were insecure! The city rested upon three\ncolumns, one of them intact, another quite decayed away, the third\npartially corroded and soon to crumble into ruin. He peered up from, his\nblue depths, and in a fateful couplet of verses warned the townsmen of\ntheir impending doom. In this prophetic utterance ascribed to the\nfabulous Cola Pesce is echoed a popular apprehension that was only too\njustified.",
        "F. Muenter–one of a band of travellers who explored these regions after\nthe earthquake of 1783–also gave voice to his fears that Messina had\nnot yet experienced the full measure of her calamities. . . .",
        "I remember a night in September of 1908, a Sunday night, fragrant with\nthe odours of withered rosemary and cistus and fennel that streamed in\naromatic showers from the scorched heights overhead–a starlit night,\ntranquil and calm. Never had Messina appeared so attractive to me.\nArriving there generally in the daytime and from larger and sprightlier\ncentres of civilization, one is prone to notice only its defects. But\nnight, especially a southern night, has a wizard touch. It transforms\ninto objects of mysterious beauty all unsightly things, or hides them\nclean away; while the nobler works of man, those facades and cornices\nand full-bellied balconies of cunningly wrought iron rise up, under its\nenchantment, ethereal as the palace of fairies. And coming, as I then\ndid, from the sun-baked river-beds of Calabria, this place, with its\nbroad and well-paved streets, its glittering cafes and demure throng of\nevening idlers, seemed a veritable metropolis, a world-city.",
        "With deliberate slowness, ritardando con molto sentimento, I worked my\nway to the familiar restaurant.",
        "At last! At last, after an interminable diet of hard bread, onions and\ngoat’s cheese, I was to enjoy the complicated menu mapped out weeks\nbeforehand, after elaborate consideration and balancing of merits; so\ncomplicated, that its details have long ago lapsed from my memory. I\nrecollect only the sword-fish, a local speciality, and (as crowning\nglory) the cassata alla siciliana, a glacial symphony, a multicoloured\nice of commingling flavours, which requires far more time to describe\nthan to devour. Under the influence of this Sybaritic fare, helped down\nwith a crusted bottle of Calabrian wine–your Sicilian stuff is too\nstrong for me, too straightforward, uncompromising; I prefer to be\nwheedled out of my faculties by inches, like a gentleman–under this\ngenial stimulus my extenuated frame was definitely restored; I became\nmellow and companionable; the traveller’s lot, I finally concluded, is\nnot the worst on earth. Everything was as it should be. As for\nMessina–Messina was unquestionably a pleasant city. But why were all\nthe shops shut so early in the evening?",
        "“These Sicilians,” said the waiter, an old Neapolitan acquaintance, in\nreply to my enquiries, “are always playing some game. They are\npretending to be Englishmen at this moment; they have the Sunday-closing\nobsession on the brain. Their attacks generally last a fortnight; it’s\nlike the measles. Poor people.”",
        "Playing at being Englishmen!",
        "They have invented a new game now, those that are left of them. They are\nliving in dolls’ houses, and the fit is likely to last for some little\ntime.",
        "An engineer remarked to me, not long ago, among the ruins:",
        "“This baracca, this wooden shelter, has an interior surface area of\nless than thirty square metres. Thirty-three persons–men, women, and\nchildren–have been living and sleeping in it for the last five months.”",
        "“A little overcrowded?” I suggested.",
        "“Yes. Some of them are beginning to talk of overcrowding. It was all\nvery well in the winter months, but when August comes. . . . Well, we\nshall see.”",
        "No prophetic visions of the Messina of to-day, with its minute sheds\nperched among a wilderness of ruins and haunted by scared shadows in\nsable vestments of mourning, arose in my mind that evening as I sat at\nthe little marble table, sipping my coffee–overroasted, like all\nItalian coffee, by exactly two minutes–and puffing contentedly at my\ncigar, while the sober crowd floated hither and thither before my eyes.\nYes, everything was as it should be. And yet, what a chance!",
        "What a chance for some God, in this age of unbelief, to establish his\nrule over mankind on the firm foundations of faith! We are always\ncomplaining, nowadays, of an abatement of religious feeling. How easy\nfor such a one to send down an Isaiah to foretell the hour of the coming\ncatastrophe, and thus save those of its victims who were disposed to\nhearken to the warning voice; to reanimate the flagging zeal of\nworshippers, to straighten doubts and segregate the sheep from the\ngoats! Truly, He moves in a mysterious way, for no divine message came;\nthe just were entombed with the unjust amid a considerable deal of\ntelegraphing and heart-breaking.",
        "A few days after the disaster the Catholic papers explained matters by\nsaying that the people of Messina had not loved their Madonna\nsufficiently well. But she loved them none the less, and sent the\nearthquake as an admonishment. Rather a robust method of conciliating\ntheir affection; not exactly the suaviter in modo. . . .",
        "But if genuine prophets can only flourish among the malarious willow\nswamps of old Babylon and such-like improbable spots, we might at least\nhave expected better things of our modern spiritualists. Why should\ntheir apparitions content themselves with announcing the decease, at the\nAntipodes, of profoundly uninteresting relatives? Alas! I begin to\nperceive that spirits of the right kind, of the useful kind, have yet to\nbe discovered. Our present-day ghosts are like seismographs; they\nchronicle the event after it has happened. Now, what we want is-----",
        "“The Signore smokes, and smokes, and smokes. Why not take the tram and\nlisten to the municipal music in the gardens?”",
        "“Music? Gardens? An excellent suggestion, Gennarino.”",
        "Even as a small Italian town would be incomplete without its piazza\nwhere streets converge and commercial pulses beat their liveliest\nmeasure, so every larger one contrives to possess a public garden for\nthe evening disport of its citizens; night-life being the true life of\nthe south. Charming they are, most of them; none more delectable than\nthat of old Messina–a spacious pleasaunce, decked out with trim palms\nand flower-beds and labyrinthine walks freshly watered, and cooled, that\nevening, by stealthy breezes from the sea. The grounds were festively\nilluminated, and as I sat down near the bandstand and watched the folk\nmeandering to and fro, I calculated that no fewer than thirty thousand\npersons were abroad, taking their pleasure under the trees, in the bland\nair of evening. An orderly, well-dressed crowd. We may smile when they\ntell us that these people will stint themselves of the necessities of\nlife in order to wear fine clothes, but the effect, for an outsider, is\nall that it should be. For the rest, the very urchins, gambolling about,\nhad an air of happy prosperity, different from the squalor of the north\nwith its pinched white faces, its over-breeding and under-feeding.",
        "And how well the sensuous Italian strains accord with such an hour and\nscene! They were playing, if I remember rightly, the ever-popular Aida;\nother items followed later–more ambitious ones; a Hungarian rhapsody,\nBerlioz, a selection from Wagner.",
        "“Musica filosofica” said my neighbour, alluding to the German\ncomposer. He was a spare man of about sixty; a sunburnt, military\ncountenance, seamed by lines of suffering. “Non va in Sicilia–it\nwon’t do in this country. Not that we fail to appreciate your great\nthinkers,” he added. “We read and admire your Schopenhauer, your\nSpencer. They give passable representations of Wagner in Naples. But-----”",
        "“The climate?”",
        "“Precisely. I have travelled, sir; and knowing your Berlin, and London,\nand Boston, have been able to observe how ill our Italian architecture\nlooks under your grey skies, how ill our music sounds among the complex\nappliances of your artificial life. It has made you earnest, this\nclimate of yours, and prone to take earnestly your very pastimes.\nMusic, for us, has remained what it was in the Golden Age–an\nunburdening of the soul on a summer’s night. They play well, these\nfellows. Palermo, too, has a respectable band–Oh! a little too fast,\nthat recitativo!”",
        "“The Signore is a musician?”",
        "“A proprietario. But I delight in music, and I beguiled myself with\nthe fiddle as a youngster. Nowadays–look here!” And he extended his\nhand; it was crippled. “Rheumatism. I have it here, and here\"–pointing\nto various regions of his body–”and here! Ah, these doctors! The\nbaths I have taken! The medicines–the ointments–the embrocations: a\nperfect pharmacopceia! I can hardly crawl now, and without the help of\nthese two devoted boys even this harmless little diversion would have\nbeen denied me. My nephews–orphans,” he added, observing the direction\nof my glance.",
        "They sat on his other side, handsome lads, who spoke neither too much\nnor too little. Every now and then they rose with one accord and\nstrolled among the surging crowd to stretch their legs, returning after\nfive minutes to their uncle’s side. His eyes always followed their\nmovements.",
        "“My young brother, had he lived, would have made men of them,” he once\nobserved.",
        "The images revive, curiously pertinacious, with dim lapses and gulfs. I\ncan see them still, the two boys, their grave demeanour belied by mobile\nlips and mischievous fair curls of Northern ancestry; the other, leaning\nforward intent upon the music, and caressing his moustache with bent\nfingers upon which glittered a jewel set in massive gold–some scarab or\nintaglio, the spoil of old Magna Graecia. His conversation, during the\nintervals, moved among the accepted formulas of cosmopolitanism with\neasy flow, quickened at times by the individual emphasis of a man who\ncan forsake conventional tracks and think for himself. Among other\nthings, he had contrived an original project for reviving the lemon\nindustry of his country, which, though it involved a few tariff\nmodifications–\"a mere detail\"–struck me as amazingly effective and\ningenious. The local deputy, it seems, shared my view, for he had\nundertaken to bring it before the notice of Parliament.",
        "What was it?",
        "I have forgotten!",
        "So we discussed the world, while the music played under the starlit\nsouthern night.",
        "It must have been midnight ere a final frenzied galop on the part of the\nindefatigable band announced the close of the entertainment. I walked a\nfew paces beside the lame “proprietor” who, supported on the arms of his\nnephews, made his way to the spot where the cabs were waiting–his\nrheumatism, he explained, obliging him to drive. How he had enjoyed\nwalking as a youth, and what pleasure it would now have given him to\nprotract, during a promenade to my hotel, our delightful conversation!\nBut infirmities teach us to curtail our pleasures, and many things that\nseem natural to man’s bodily configuration are found to be unattainable.\nHe seldom left his rooms; the stairs–the diabolical stairs! Would I at\nleast accept his card and rest assured how gladly he would receive me\nand do all in his power to make my stay agreeable?",
        "That card has gone the way of numberless others which the traveller in\nSouthern Europe gathers about him. I have also forgotten the old man’s\nname. But the palazzo in which he lived bore a certain historical\ntitle which happened to be very familiar to me. I remember wondering how\nit came to reach Messina.",
        "In the olden days, of course, the days of splendour.",
        "Will they ever return?",
        "It struck me that the sufferings of the survivors would be alleviated if\nall the sheds in which they are living could be painted white or\npearl-grey in order to protect them, as far as possible, from the\nburning rays of the sun. I mentioned the idea to an overseer.",
        "“We are painting as fast as we can,” he replied. “An expensive matter,\nhowever. The Villagio Elena alone has cost us, in this respect, twenty\nthousand francs–with the greatest economy.”",
        "This will give some notion of the scale on which things have to be done.\nThe settlement in question contains some two hundred sheds–two hundred\nout of over ten thousand.",
        "But I was alluding not to these groups of hygienic bungalows erected by\npublic munificence and supplied with schools, laboratories, orphanages,\nhospitals, and all that can make life endurable, but to the\nothers–those which the refugees built for themselves–ill-contrived\nhovels, patched together with ropes, potato-sacks, petroleum cans and\nmiscellaneous odds and ends. A coat of whitewash, at least, inside and\nout. ... I was thinking, too, of those still stranger dwellings, the\ndisused railway trucks which the government has placed at the disposal\nof homeless families. At many Stations along the line may be seen\nstrings of these picturesque wigwams crowded with poor folk who have\ninstalled themselves within, apparently for ever. They are cultivating\ntheir favourite flowers and herbs in gaudy rows along the wooden\nplatforms of the carriages; the little children, all dressed in black,\nplay about in the shade underneath. The people will suffer in these\nnarrow tenements under the fierce southern sun, after their cool\ncourtyards and high-vaulted chambers! There will be diseases, too;\ntyphoids from the disturbed drainage and insufficient water-supply; eye\ntroubles, caused by the swarms of flies and tons of accumulated dust.\nThe ruins are also overrun with hordes of mangy cats and dogs which\nought to be exterminated without delay.",
        "If, as seems likely, those rudely improvised sheds are to be inhabited\nindefinitely, we may look forward to an interesting phenomenon, a\nreversion to a corresponding type of man. The lack of the most ordinary\nappliances of civilization, such as linen, washing-basins and cooking\nutensils, will reduce them to the condition of savages who view these\nthings with indifference or simple curiosity; they will forget that they\never had any use for them. And life in these huts where human beings are\nherded together after the manner of beasts–one might almost say fitted\nin, like the fragments of a mosaic pavement–cannot but be harmful to\nthe development of growing children.",
        "The Calabrians, I was told, distinguished themselves by unearthly\nferocity; Reggio was given over to a legion of fiends that descended\nfrom the heights during the week of confusion. “They tore the rings and\nbrooches off the dead,” said a young officiai to me. “They strangled the\nwounded and dying, in order to despoil them more comfortably. Here, and\nat Messina, the mutilated corpses were past computation; but the\nCalabrians were the worst.”",
        "Vampires, offspring of Night and Chaos.",
        "So Dolomieu, speaking of the depravation incroyable des moeurs which\naccompanied the earthquake of 1783, recounts the case of a householder\nof Polistena who was pinned down under some masonry, his legs emerging\nout of the ruins; his servant came and took the silver buckles off his\nshoes and then fled, without attempting to free him. We have seen\nsomething of this kind more recently at San Francisco.",
        "“After despoiling the corpses, they ransacked the dwellings. Five\nthousand beds, sir, were carried up from Reggio into the mountains.”",
        "“Five thousand beds! Per Dio! It seems a considerable number.”",
        "A young fellow, one of the survivors, attached himself to me in the\ncapacity of guide through the ruins of Reggio. He wore the\ncharacteristic earthquake look, a dazed and bewildered expression of\ncountenance; he spoke in a singularly deliberate manner. Knowing the\ncountry, I was soon bending my steps in the direction of the cemetery,\nchiefly for the sake of the exquisite view from those windswept heights,\nand to breathe more freely after the dust and desolation of the lower\nparts. This burial-ground is in the same state as that of Messina, once\nthe pride of its citizens; the insane frolic of nature has not respected\nthe slumber of the dead or their commemorative shrines; it has made a\nmockery of the place, twisting the solemn monuments into repulsive and\nirreverential shapes.",
        "But who can recount the freaks of stone and iron during those\nmoments–the hair-breadth escapes? My companion’s case was miraculous\nenough. Awakened from sleep with the first shock, he saw, by the dim\nlight of the lamp which burns in all their bedrooms, the wall at his\nbedside weirdly gaping asunder. He darted to reach the opening, but it\nclosed again and caught his arm in a stony grip. Hours seemed to\npass–the pain was past enduring; then the kindly cleft yawned once\nmore, allowing him to jump into the garden below. Simultaneously he\nheard a crash as the inner rooms of the house fell; then climbed aloft,\nand for four days wandered among the bleak, wet hills. Thousands were in\nthe same plight.",
        "I asked what he found to eat.",
        "“Erba, Signore. We all did. You could not touch property; a single\norange, and they would have killed you.”",
        "Grass!",
        "He bore a name renowned in the past, but his home being turned into a\ndust-heap under which his money, papers and furniture, his two parents\nand brothers, are still lying, he now gains a livelihood by carrying\nvegetables and fruit from the harbour to the collection of sheds\nhonoured by the name of market. Later in the day we happened to walk\npast the very mansion, which lies near the quay. “Here is my house and\nmy family,” he remarked, indicating, with a gesture of antique\nresignation, a pile of wreckage.",
        "Hard by, among the ruins, there sat a young woman with dishevelled hair,\nsinging rapturously. “Her husband was crushed to death,” he said, “and\nit unhinged her wits. Strange, is it not, sir? They used to fight like\nfiends, and now–she sings to him night and day to come back.”",
        "Love–so the Greeks fabled–was the child of Chaos.",
        "In this part of the town stands the civic museum, which all readers of\nGissing’s “Ionian Sea” will remember as the closing note of those\nharmonious pages. It is shattered, like everything else that he visited\nin Reggio; like the hotel where he lodged; like the cathedral whose\nproud superscription Circumlegentes devenimus Rhegium impressed him so\ndeeply; like that “singular bit of advanced civilization, which gave me\nan odd sense of having strayed into the world of those romancers who\nforecast the future–a public slaughter-house of tasteful architecture,\nset in a grove of lemon trees and palms, suggesting the dreamy ideal of\nsome reformer whose palate shrinks from vegetarianism.” We went the\nround of all these places, not forgetting the house which bears the\ntablet commemorating the death of a young soldier who fell fighting\nagainst the Bourbons. From its contorted iron balcony there hangs a rope\nby which the inmates may have tried to let themselves down.",
        "A friend of mine, Baron C----- of Stilo, is a member of that same\npatriotic family, and gave me the following strange account. He was\nabsent from Reggio at the time of the catastrophe, but three others of\nthem were staying there. On the first shock they rushed together,\npanic-stricken, into one room; the floor gave way, and they suddenly\nfound themselves sitting in their motor-car which happened to be placed\nexactly below them. They escaped with a few cuts and bruises.",
        "An inscription on a neighbouring ruin runs to the effect that the\nmansion having been severely damaged in the earthquake of 1783, its\nowner had rebuilt it on lines calculated to defy future shattering!\nWhether he would rebuild it yet again?",
        "Nevertheless, there seems to be some chance for the revival of Reggio;\nits prognosis is not utterly hopeless.",
        "But Messina is in desperate case.",
        "That haughty sea-front, with its long line of imposing edifices–imagine\na painted theatre decoration of cardboard through which some sportive\nbehemoth has been jumping with frantic glee; there you have it. And\nwithin, all is desolation; the wreckage reaches to the windows; you must\nclamber over it as best you can. What an all-absorbing post-tertiary\ndeposit for future generations, for the crafty antiquarian who deciphers\nthe history of mankind out of kitchen-middens and deformed heaps of\nforgotten trash! The whole social life of the citizens, their arts,\ndomestic economy, and pastimes, lies embedded in that rubbish. “A\nmusical race,” he will conclude, observing the number of decayed\npianofortes, guitars, and mandolines. The climate of Messina, he will\nfurther arene, must have been a wet one, inasmuch as there are umbrellas\neverywhere, standing upright among the debris, leaning all forlorn\nagainst the ruins, or peering dismally from under them. It rained much\nduring those awful days, and umbrellas were at a premium. Yet fifty of\nthem would not have purchased a loaf of bread.",
        "It was Goethe who, speaking of Pompeii, said that of the many\ncatastrophes which have afflicted mankind few have given greater\npleasure to posterity. The same will never be said of Messina, whose\nrelics, for the most part, are squalid and mean. The German poet, by the\nway, visited this town shortly after the disaster of 1783, and describes\nits zackige Ruinenwueste–words whose very sound is suggestive of\nshatterings and dislocations. Nevertheless, the place revived again.",
        "But what was 1783?",
        "A mere rehearsal, an amateur performance.",
        "Wandering about in this world of ghosts, I passed the old restaurant\nwhere the sword-fish had once tasted so good–an accumulation of stones\nand mortar–and reached the cathedral. It is laid low, all save the\nGargantuan mosaic figures that stare down from behind the altar in\nfutile benediction of Chaos; inane, terrific. This, then, is the house\nof that feudal lady of the fortiter in re, who sent an earthquake and\ncalled it love. Womanlike, she doted on gold and precious stones, and\nthey recovered her fabulous hoard, together with a copy of a Latin\nletter she sent to the Christians of Messina by the hand of Saint Paul.",
        "And not long afterwards–how came it to pass?–my steps were guided amid\nthat wilderness towards a narrow street containing the ruins of a\npalazzo that bore, on a tablet over the ample doorway, an inscription\nwhich arrested my attention. It was an historical title familiar to me;\nand forthwith a train of memories, slumbering in the caverns of my mind,\nwas ignited. Yes; there was no doubt about it: the old “proprietor” and\nhis nephews, he of the municipal gardens. . . .",
        "I wondered how they had met their fate, on the chill wintry morning. For\nassuredly, in that restricted space, not a soul can have escaped alive;\nthe wreckage, hitherto undisturbed, still covered their remains.",
        "And, remembering the old man and his humane converse that evening under\nthe trees, the true meaning of the catastrophe began to disentangle\nitself from accidental and superficial aspects. For I confess that the\nmassacre of a myriad Chinamen leaves me cool and self-possessed; between\nsuch creatures and ourselves there is hardly more than the frail bond of\na common descent from the ape; they are altogether too remote for our\nnarrow world-sympathies. I would as soon shed tears over the lost\nPleiad. But these others are our spiritual cousins; we have deep roots\nin this warm soil of Italy, which brought forth a goodly tithe of what\nis best in our own lives, in our arts and aspirations.",
        "And I thought of the two nephews, their decent limbs all distorted and\nmangled under a heap of foul rubbish, waiting for a brutal disinterment\nand a nameless grave. This is no legitimate death, this murderous\nviolation of life. How inconceivably hateful is such a leave-taking, and\nall that follows after! To picture a fair young body, that divine\ninstrument of joy, crushed into an unsightly heap; once loved, now\nloathed of all men, and thrust at last, with abhorrence, into some\ncommon festering pit of abominations. . . . The Northern type–a mighty\nbond, again; a tie of blood, this time, between our race and those\nrulers of the South, whose exploits in this land of orange and myrtle\nsurpassed the dreamings of romance.",
        "Strange to reflect that, without the ephemeral friendship of that\nevening, Messina of to-day might have represented to my mind a mere\nspectacle, the hecatomb of its inhabitants extorting little more than a\nconventional sigh. So it is. The human heart has been constructed on\nsomewhat ungenerous lines. Moralists, if any still exist on earth, may\ngeneralize with eloquence from the masses, but our poets have long ago\nsuccumbed to the pathos of single happenings; the very angels of Heaven,\nthey say, take more joy in one sinner that repenteth than in a hundred\nrighteous, which, duly apprehended, is only an application of the same\nilliberal principle.",
        "A rope of bed-sheets knotted together dangled from one of the upper\nwindows, its end swaying in mid-air at the height of the second floor.\nMany of them do, at Messina: a desperate expedient of escape. Some pots\nof geranium and cactus, sadly flowering, adorned the other windows,\nwhose glass panes were unbroken. But for the ominous sunlight pouring\nthrough them from within, the building looked fairly intact on this\nouter side. Its ponderous gateway, however, through which I had hoped to\nenter, was choked up by internal debris, and I was obliged to climb,\nwith some little trouble, to the rear of the house.",
        "If a titanic blade had sheared through the palazzo lengthwise, the\nthing could not have been done more neatly. The whole interior had gone\ndown, save a portion of the rooms abutting on the street-front; these\nwere literally cut in half, so as to display an ideal section of\ndomestic architecture. The house with its inmates and all it contained\nwas lying among the high-piled wreckage within, under my feet; masonry\nmostly–entire fragments of wall interspersed with crumbling mortar and\nconvulsed iron girders that writhed over the surface or plunged sullenly\ninto the depths; fetid rents and gullies in between, their flanks\naffording glimpses of broken vases, candelabras, hats, bottles,\nbirdcages, writing-books, brass pipes, sofas, picture-frames,\ntablecloths, and all the paltry paraphernalia of everyday life. No\nattempt at stratification, horizontal, vertical, or inclined; it was as\nif the objects had been thrown up by some playful volcano and allowed to\nsettle where they pleased. Two immense chiselled blocks of stone–one\nlying prone at the bottom of a miniature ravine, the other proudly\nerect, like a Druidical monument, in the upper regions–reminded me of\nthe existence of a staircase, a diabolical staircase.",
        "Looking upwards, I endeavoured to reconstruct the habits of the inmates,\nbut found it impossible, the section that remained being too shallow.\nSky-blue seems to have been their favourite colour. The kitchen was\neasily discernible, the hearth with its store of charcoal underneath,\ncopper vessels hanging in a neat row overhead, and an open cupboard full\nof household goods; a neighbouring room (the communicating doors were\nall gone), with lace window-curtains, a table, lamp, and book, and a\nbedstead toppling over the abyss; another one, carpeted and hung with\npictures and a large faded mirror, below which ran a row of shelves that\ngroaned under a multitudinous collection of phials and bottles.",
        "The old man’s embrocations. . . .",
        "After such sights of suffering humanity–back to the fields and\nmountains! Aspromonte, the wild region behind Reggio, was famous, not\nlong ago, for Garibaldi’s battle. But the exploits of this warrior have\nlately been eclipsed by those of the brigand Musolino, who infested the\ncountry up to a few years ago, defying the soldiery and police of all\nItaly. He would still be safe and unharmed had he remained in these\nfastnesses. But he wandered away, wishful to leave Italy for good and\nall, and was captured far from his home by some policemen who were\nlooking for another man, and who nearly fainted when he pronounced his\nname. After a sensational trial, they sentenced him to thirty odd years’\nimprisonment; he is now languishing in the fortress of Porto Longone on\nElba. Whoever has looked into this Spanish citadel will not envy him. Of\nthe lovely little bay, of the loadstone mountain, of the romantic\npathway to the hermitage of Monserrato or the glittering beach at\nRio–of all the charms of Porto Longone he knows nothing, despite a\nlengthy residence on the spot.",
        "They say he has grown consumptive and witless during the long solitary\nconfinement which preceded his present punishment–an eternal night in a\nnarrow cell. No wonder. I have seen the condemned on their release from\nthese boxes of masonry at the island of Santo Stefano: dazed shadows,\ntottering, with complexions the colour of parchment. These are the\nsurvivors. But no one asks after the many who die in these dungeons\nfrenzied, or from battering their heads against the wall; no one knows\ntheir number save the doctor and the governor, whose lips are sealed. . . .",
        "I decided upon a rear attack of Aspromonte. I would go by rail as far as\nBagnara on the Tyrrhenian, the station beyond Scylla of old renown; and\nthence afoot via Sant’ Eufemia [Footnote: Not to be confounded with the\nrailway station on the gulf of that name, near Maida.] to Sinopoli,\npushing on, if day permitted, as far as Delianuova, at the foot of\nthe mountain. Early next morning I would climb the summit and descend to\nthe shores of the Ionian, to Bova. It seemed a reasonable programme.",
        "All this Tyrrhenian coast-line is badly shattered; far more so than the\nsouthern shore. But the scenery is finer. There is nothing on that side\nto compare with the views from Nicastro, or Monte-leone, or Sant’ Elia\nnear Palmi. It is also more smiling, more fertile, and far less\nmalarious. Not that cultivation of the land implies absence of\nmalaria–nothing is a commoner mistake! The Ionian shore is not\nmalarious because it is desert–it is desert because malarious. The\nrichest tracts in Greece are known to be very dangerous, and it is the\nsame in Italy. Malaria and intensive agriculture go uncommonly well\ntogether. The miserable anopheles-mosquito loves the wells that are sunk\nfor the watering of the immense orange and lemon plantations in the\nReggio district; it displays a perverse predilection for the minute\npuddles left by the artificial irrigation of the fields that are covered\nwith fruit and vegetables. This artificial watering, in fact, seems to\nbe partly responsible for the spread of the disease. It is doubtful\nwhether the custom goes back into remote antiquity, for the climate used\nto be moister and could dispense with these practices. Certain products,\nonce grown in Calabria, no longer thrive there, on account of the\nincreased dryness and lack of rainfall.",
        "But there are some deadly regions, even along this Tyrrhenian shore.\nSuch is the plain of Maida, for instance, where stood not long ago the\nforest of Sant’ Eufemia, safe retreat of Parafante and other brigand\nheroes. The level lands of Rosarno and Gioia are equally ill-reputed. A\nFrench battalion stationed here in the summer of 1807 lost over sixty\nmen in fourteen days, besides leaving two hundred invalids in the\nhospital at Monteleone. Gioia is so malarious that in summer every one\nof the inhabitants who can afford the price of a ticket goes by the\nevening train to Palmato sleep there. You will do well, by the way, to\nsee something of the oil industry of Palmi, if time permits. In good\nyears, 200,000 quintals of olive oil are manufactured in the regions of\nwhich it is the commercial centre. Not long ago, before modern methods\nof refining were introduced, most of this oil was exported to Russia, to\nbe burned in holy lamps; nowadays it goes for the most part to Lucca, to\nbe adulterated for foreign markets (the celebrated Lucca oil, which the\nsimple Englishman regards as pure); only the finest quality is sent\nelsewhere, to Nice. From Gioia there runs a postal diligence once a day\nto Delianuova of which I might have availed myself, had I not preferred\nto traverse the country on foot.",
        "The journey from Reggio to Bagnara on this fair summer morning, along\nthe rippling Mediterranean, was short enough, but sufficiently long to\nlet me overhear the following conversation:",
        "A.–What a lovely sea! It is good, after all, to take three or four\nbaths a year. What think you?",
        "B.–I? No. For thirteen years I have taken no baths. But they are\nconsidered good for children.",
        "The calamities that Bagnara has suffered in the past have been so\nnumerous, so fierce and so varied that, properly speaking, the town has\nno right to exist any longer. It has enjoyed more than its full share of\nearthquakes, having been shaken to the ground over and over again. Sir\nWilliam Hamilton reports that 3017 persons were killed in that of 1783.\nThe horrors of war, too, have not spared it, and a certain modern\nexploit of the British arms here strikes me as so instructive that I\nwould gladly extract it from Grant’s “Adventures of an Aide-de-Camp,\"\nwere it not too long to transcribe, and far too good to abbreviate.",
        "A characteristic story, further, is told of the methods of General\nManhes at Bagnara. It may well be an exaggeration when they say that the\nentire road from Reggio to Naples was lined with the heads of\ndecapitated brigands; be that as it may, it stands to reason that\nBagnara, as befits an important place, was to be provided with an\n-appropriate display of these trophies. The heads were exhibited in\nbaskets, with strict injunctions to the authorities that they were not\nto be touched, seeing that they served not only for decorative but also\nmoral purposes–as examples. Imagine, therefore, the General’s feelings\non being told that one of these heads had been stolen; stolen, probably,\nby some pious relative of the deceased rascal, who wished to give the\nrelic a decent Christian burial.",
        "“That’s rather awkward,” he said, quietly musing. “But of course the\nspecimen must be replaced. Let me see. . . . Suppose we put the head of\nthe mayor of Bagnara into the vacant basket? Shall we? Yes, we’ll have\nthe mayor. It will make him more careful in future.” And within half an\nhour the basket was filled once more.",
        "There was a little hitch in starting from Bagnara. From the windings of\nthe carriage-road as portrayed by the map, I guessed that there must be\na number of short cuts into the uplands at the back of the town,\nundiscoverable to myself, which would greatly shorten the journey.\nBesides, there was my small bag to be carried. A porter familiar with\nthe tracks was plainly required, and soon enough I found a number of\nlusty youths leaning against a wall and doing nothing in particular.\nYes, they would accompany me, they said, the whole lot of them, just for\nthe fun of the thing.",
        "“And my bag?” I asked.",
        "“A bag to be carried? Then we must get a woman.”",
        "They unearthed a nondescript female who undertook to bear the burden as\nfar as Sinopoli for a reasonable consideration. So far good. But as we\nproceeded, the boys began to drop off, till only a single one was left.\nAnd then the woman suddenly vanished down a side street, declaring that\nshe must change her clothes. We waited for three-quarters of an hour, in\nthe glaring dust of the turnpike; she never emerged again, and the\nremaining boy stoutly refused to handle her load.",
        "“No,” he declared. “She must carry the bag. And I will keep you company.”",
        "The precious morning hours were wearing away, and here we stood idly by\nthe side of the road. It never struck me that the time might have been\nprofitably employed in paying a flying visit to one of the most sacred\nobjects in Calabria and possibly in the whole world, one which Signor N.\nMarcene describes as reposing at Bagnara in a rich reliquary–the\nauthentic Hat of the Mother of God. A lady tourist would not have missed\nthis chance of studying the fashions of those days. [Footnote: See next\nchapter.]",
        "Finally, in desperation, I snatched up the wretched luggage and poured\nmy griefs with unwonted eloquence into the ears of a man driving a\nbullock-cart down the road. So much was he moved, that he peremptorily\nordered his son to conduct me then and there to Sinopoli, to carry the\nbag, and claim one franc by way of payment. The little man tumbled off\nthe cart, rather reluctantly.",
        "“Away with you!” cried the stern parent, and we began the long march,\nclimbing uphill in the blazing sunshine; winding, later on, through\nshady chestnut woods and across broad tracts of cultivated land. It was\nplain that the task was beyond his powers, and when we had reached a\nspot where the strange-looking new village of Sant’ Eufemia was\nvisible–it is built entirely of wooden shelters; the stone town was\ngreatly shaken in the late earthquake–he was obliged to halt, and\nthenceforward stumbled slowly into the place. There he deposited the bag\non the ground, and faced me squarely.",
        "“No more of this!” he said, concentrating every ounce of his virility\ninto a look of uncompromising defiance.",
        "“Then I shall not pay you a single farthing, my son. And, moreover, I\nwill tell your father. You know what he commanded: to Sinopoli. This is\nonly Sant’ Eufemia. Unless-----”",
        "“You will tell my father? Unless-----?”",
        "“Unless you discover some one who will carry the bag not only to\nSinopoli, but as far as Delianuova.” I was not in the mood for repeating\nthe experiences of the morning.",
        "“It is difficult. But we will try.”",
        "He went in search, and returned anon with a slender lad of unusual\ncomeliness–an earthquake orphan. “This big one,” he explained, “walks\nwherever you please and carries whatever you give him. And you will pay\nhim nothing at all, unless he deserves it. Such is the arrangement. Are\nyou content?”",
        "“You have acted like a man.”",
        "The earthquake survivor set off at a swinging pace, and we soon reached\nSinopoli–new Sinopoli; the older settlement lies at a considerable\ndistance. Midday was past, and the long main street of the town–a\nformer fief of the terrible Ruffo family–stood deserted in the\ntrembling heat. None the less there was sufficient liveliness within the\nhouses; the whole place seemed in a state of jollification. It was\nSunday, the orphan explained; the country was duller than usual,\nhowever, because of the high price of wine. There had been no murders to\nspeak of–no, not for a long time past. But the vintage of this year, he\nadded, promises well, and life will soon become normal again.",
        "The mule track from here to Delianuova traverses some pretty scenery,\nboth wild and pastoral. But the personal graces of my companion made me\ntake small heed of the landscape. He was aglow with animal spirits, and\nhis conversation naively brilliant and of uncommon import. Understanding\nat a glance that he belonged to a type which is rather rare in Calabria,\nthat he was a classic (of a kind), I made every effort to be pleasant to\nhim; and I must have succeeded, for he was soon relating anecdotes which\nwould have been neither instructive, nor even intelligible, to the\njeune fille; all this, with angelic serenity of conscience.",
        "This radiantly-vicious child was the embodiment of the joy of life, the\nperfect immoralist. There was no cynicism in his nature, no cruelty, no\nobliquity, no remorse; nothing but sunshine with a few clouds sailing\nacross the fathomless blue spaces–the sky of Hellas. Nihil humani\nalienum; and as I listened to those glad tales, I marvelled at the\nmany-tinted experiences that could be crammed into seventeen short\nyears; what a document the ad-verttures of such a frolicsome demon would\nbe, what a feast for the initiated, could some one be induced to make\nthem known! But such things are hopelessly out of the question. And that\nis why so many of our wise people go into their graves without ever\nlearning what happens in this world.",
        "Among minor matters, he mentioned that he had already been three times\nto prison for “certain little affairs of blood,” while defending\n\"certain friends.” Was it not dull, I asked, in prison? “The time passes\npleasantly anywhere,” he answered, “when you are young. I always make\nfriends, even in prison.” I could well believe it. His affinities were\nwith the blithe crew of the Liber Stratonis. He had a roving eye and the\nmouth of Antinous; and his morals were those of a condescending tiger-cub.",
        "Arriving at Delianuova after sunset, he conceived the project of\naccompanying me next morning up Montalto. I hesitated. In the first\nplace, I was going not only up that mountain, but to Bova on the distant\nIonian littoral-----",
        "“For my part,” he broke in, “ho pigliato confidenza. If you mistrust\nme, here! take my knife,” an ugly blade, pointed, and two inches in\nexcess of the police regulation length. This act of quasi-filial\nsubmission touched me; but it was not his knife I feared so much as that\nof “certain friends.” Some little difference of opinion might arise,\nsome question of money or other argument, and lo! the friends would be\nat hand (they always are), and one more stranger might disappear among\nthe clefts and gullies of Montalto. Aspromonte, the roughest corner of\nItaly, is no place for misunderstandings; the knife decides promptly who\nis right or wrong, and only two weeks ago I was warned not to cross the\ndistrict without a carbineer on either side of me.",
        "But to have clothed my thoughts in words during his gracious mood would\nhave been supremely unethical. I contented myself with the trite but\npregnant remark that things sometimes looked different in the morning,\nwhich provoked a pagan fit of laughter; farewelled him “with the\nMadonna!” and watched as he withdrew under the trees, lithe and buoyant,\nlike a flame that is swallowed up in the night.",
        "Only then did the real business begin. I should be sorry to say into how\nmany houses and wine-shops the obliging owner of the local inn conducted\nme, in search of a guide. We traversed all the lanes of this straggling\nand fairly prosperous place, and even those of its suburb Paracorio,\nevidently of Byzantine origin; the answer was everywhere the same: To\nMontalto, yes; to Bova, no! Night drew on apace and, as a last resource,\nhe led the way to the dwelling of a gentleman of the old school–a\nretired brigand, to wit, who, as I afterwards learned, had some ten or\ntwelve homicides to his account. Delianuova, and indeed the whole of\nAspromonte, has a bad reputation for crime.",
        "It was our last remaining chance.",
        "We found the patriarch sitting in a simple but tidy chamber, smoking his\npipe and playing with a baby; his daughter-in-law rose as we entered,\nand discreetly moved into an adjoining room. The cheery cut-throat put\nthe baby down to crawl on the floor, and his eyes sparkled when he heard\nof Bova.",
        "“Ah, one speaks of Bova!” he said. “A fine walk over the mountain!” He\nmuch regretted that he was too old for the trip, but so-and-so, he\nthought, might know something of the country. It pained him, too, that\nhe could not offer me a glass of wine. There was none in the house. In\nhis day, he added, it was not thought right to drink in the modern\nfashion; this wine-bibbing was responsible for considerable mischief; it\ntroubled the brain, driving men to do things they afterwards repented.\nHe drank only milk, having become accustomed to it during a long life\namong the hills. Milk cools the blood, he said, and steadies the hand,\nand keeps a man’s judgment undisturbed.",
        "The person he had named was found after some further search. He was a\nbronzed, clean-shaven type of about fifty, who began by refusing his\nservices point-blank, but soon relented, on hearing the ex-brigand’s\nrecommendation of his qualities.",
        "Southern saints, like their worshippers, put on new faces and vestments\nin the course of ages. Old ones die away; new ones take their place.\nSeveral hundred of the older class of saint have clean faded from the\npopular memory, and are now so forgotten that the wisest priest can tell\nyou nothing about them save, perhaps, that “he’s in the\nchurch\"–meaning, that some fragment of his holy anatomy survives as a\nrelic amid a collection of similar antiques. But you can find their\nhistories in early literature, and their names linger on old maps where\nthey are given to promontories and other natural features which are\ngradually being re-christened.",
        "Such saints were chiefly non-Italian: Byzantines or Africans who, by\nmiraculous intervention, protected the village or district of which they\nwere patrons from the manifold scourges of medi-aevalism; they took the\nplace of the classic tutelar deities. They were men; they could fight;\nand in those troublous times that is exactly what saints were made for.",
        "With the softening of manners a new element appears. Male saints lost\ntheir chief raison d’etre, and these virile creatures were superseded\nby pacific women. So, to give only one instance, Saint Rosalia in\nPalermo displaced the former protector Saint Mark. Her sacred bones were\nmiraculously discovered in a cave; and have since been identified as\nthose of a goat. But it was not till the twelfth century that the cult\nof female saints began to assume imposing dimensions.",
        "Of the Madonna no mention occurs in the songs of Bishop Paulinus (fourth\ncentury); no monument exists in the Neapolitan catacombs. Thereafter her\ncult begins to dominate.",
        "She supplied the natives with what orthodox Christianity did not give\nthem, but what they had possessed from early times–a female element in\nreligion. Those Greek settlers had their nymphs, their Venus, and so\nforth; the Mother of God absorbed and continued their functions. There\nis indeed only one of these female pagan divinities whose role she has\nnot endeavoured to usurp–Athene. Herein she reflects the minds of her\ncreators, the priests and common people, whose ideal woman contents\nherself with the duties of motherhood. I doubt whether an\nAthene-Madonna, an intellectual goddess, could ever have been evolved;\ntheir attitude towards gods in general is too childlike and positive.",
        "South Italians, famous for abstractions in philosophy, cannot endure\nthem in religion. Unlike ourselves, they do not desire to learn anything\nfrom their deities or to argue about them. They only wish to love and be\nloved in return, reserving to themselves the right to punish them, when\nthey deserve it. Countless cases are on record where (pictures or\nstatues of) Madonnas and saints have been thrown into a ditch for not\ndoing what they were told, or for not keeping their share of a bargain.\nDuring the Vesuvius eruption of 1906 a good number were subjected to\nthis “punishment,” because they neglected to protect their worshippers\nfrom the calamity according to contract (so many candles and festivals =\nso much protection).",
        "For the same reason the adult Jesus–the teacher, the God–is\npractically unknown. He is too remote from themselves and the ordinary\nactivities of their daily lives; he is not married, like his mother; he\nhas no trade, like his father (Mark calls him a carpenter); moreover,\nthe maxims of the Sermon on the Mount are so repugnant to the South\nItalian as to be almost incomprehensible. In effigy, this period of\nChrist’s life is portrayed most frequently in the primitive monuments of\nthe catacombs, erected when tradition was purer.",
        "Three tangibly-human aspects of Christ’s life figure here: the\nbambino-cult, which not only appeals to the people’s love of babyhood\nbut also carries on the old traditions of the Lar Familiaris and of\nHorus; next, the youthful Jesus, beloved of local female mystics; and\nlastly the Crucified–that grim and gloomy image of suffering which was\nimported, or at least furiously fostered, by the Spaniards.",
        "The engulfing of the saints by the Mother of God is due also to\npolitical reasons. The Vatican, once centralized in its policy, began to\nbe disquieted by the persistent survival of Byzantinism (Greek cults and\nlanguage lingered up to the twelfth century); with the Tacitean odium\nfratrum she exercised more severity towards the sister-faith than\ntowards actual paganism. [Footnote: Greek and Egyptian anchorites were\nestablished in south Italy by the fourth century. But paganism was still\nflourishing, locally, in the sixth. There is some evidence that\nChristians used to take part in pagan festivals.]",
        "The Madonna was a fit instrument for sweeping away the particularist\ntendencies of the past; she attacked relic-worship and other outworn\nsuperstitions; like a benignant whirlwind she careered over the land,\nand these now enigmatical shapes and customs fell faster than leaves of\nVallombrosa. No sanctuary or cave so remote that she did not endeavour\nto expel its male saint–its old presiding genius, whether Byzantine or\nRoman. But saints have tough lives, and do not yield without a struggle;\nthey fought for their time-honoured privileges like the “daemons” they\nwere, and sometimes came off victorious. Those sanctuaries that proved\ntoo strong to be taken by storm were sapped by an artful and determined\nsiege. The combat goes on to this day. This is what is happening to the\nthrice-deposed and still triumphant Saint Januarius, who is hard pressed\nby sheer force of numbers. Like those phagocytes which congregate from\nall sides to assail some weakened cell in the body physical, even so\nMadonna-cults–in frenzied competition with each other–cluster thickest\nround some imperilled venerable of ancient lineage, bent on his\ndestruction. The Madonna dell’ Arco, del Soccorso, and at least fifty\nothers (not forgetting the newly-invented Madonna di Pompei)–they have\nall established themselves in the particular domain of St. Januarius;\nthey are all undermining his reputation, and claiming to possess his\nspecial gifts. [Footnote: He is known to have quelled an outbreak of\nVesuvius in the fifth century, though his earliest church, I believe,\nonly dates from the ninth. His blood, famous for liquefaction, is not\nmentioned till 1337.]",
        "Early monastic movements of the Roman Church also played their part in\nobliterating old religious landmarks. Settling down in some remote place\nwith the Madonna as their leader or as their “second Mother,” these\ncompanies of holy men soon acquired such temporal and spiritual\ninfluence as enabled them successfully to oppose their divinity to the\nlocal saint, whose once bright glories began to pale before her\neffulgence. Their labours in favour of the Mother of God were part of\nthat work of consolidating Papal power which was afterwards carried on\nby the Jesuits.",
        "Perhaps what chiefly accounts for the spread of Madonna-worship is the\nhuman craving for novelty. You can invent most easily where no fixed\nlegends are established. Now the saints have fixed legendary attributes\nand histories, and as culture advances it becomes increasingly difficult\nto manufacture new saints with fresh and original characters and yet\npassable pedigrees (the experiment is tried, now and again); while the\nold saints have been exploited and are now inefficient–worn out, like\nold toys. Madonna, on the other hand, can subdivide with the ease of an\namoeba, and yet never lose her identity or credibility; moreover, thanks\nto her divine character, anything can be accredited to her–anything\ngood, however wonderful; lastly, the traditions concerning her are so\nconveniently vague that they actually foster the mythopoetic faculty.\nHence her success. Again: the man-saints were separatists; they fought\nfor their own towns against African intruders, and in those frequent and\nbloody inter-communal battles which are a feature of Italian\nmedievalism. Nowadays it is hardly proper that neighbouring townsmen,\naided and abetted by their respective saints, should sally forth to cut\neach others’ throats. The Madonna, as cosmopolitan Nike, is a fitter\npatroness for settled society.",
        "She also found a ready welcome in consequence of the pastoral\ninstitutions of the country in which the mother plays such a conspicuous\nrole. So deeply are they ingrained here that if the Mother of God had\nnot existed, the group would have been deemed incomplete; a family\nwithout a mother is to them like a tree without roots–a thing which\ncannot be. This accounts for the fact that their Trinity is not ours; it\nconsists of the Mother, the Father (Saint Joseph), and the Child–with\nSaint Anne looming in the background (the grandmother is an important\npersonage in the patriarchal family). The Creator of all things and the\nHoly Ghost have evaporated; they are too intangible and non-human.",
        "But She never became a true cosmopolitan Nike, save in literature. The\ndecentralizing spirit of South Italy was too strong for her. She had to\nconform to the old custom of geographical specialization. In all save in\nname she doffed her essential character of Mother of God, and became a\nlocal demi-god; an accessible wonder-worker attached to some particular\ndistrict. An inhabitant of village A would stand a poor chance of his\nprayers being heard by the Madonna of village B; if you have a headache,\nit is no use applying to the Madonna of the Hens, who deals with\ndiseases of women; you will find yourself in a pretty fix if you expect\nfinancial assistance from the Madonna of village C: she is a\nweather-specialist. In short, these hundreds of Madonnas have taken up\nthe qualities of the saints they supplanted.",
        "They can often outdo them; and this is yet another reason for their\nsuccess. It is a well-ascertained fact, for example, that many holy men\nhave been nourished by the Milk of the Mother of God, “not,” as a\nCatholic writer says, “in a mystic or spiritual sense, but with their\nactual lips\"; Saint Bernard “among a hundred, a thousand, others.” Nor\nis this all, for in the year 1690, a painted image of the Madonna, not\nfar from the city of Carinola, was observed to “diffuse abundant milk\"\nfor the edification of a great concourse of spectators–a miracle which\nwas recognized as such by the bishop of that diocese, Monsignor Paolo\nAyrola, who wrote a report on the subject. Some more of this authentic\nmilk is kept in a bottle in the convent of Mater Domini on Vesuvius, and\nthe chronicle of that establishment, printed in 1834, says:",
        "“Since Mary is the Mother and Co-redeemer of the Church, may she not\nhave left some drops of her precious milk as a gift to this Church, even\nas we still possess some of the blood of Christ? In various churches\nthere exists some of this milk, by means of which many graces and\nbenefits are obtained. We find such relics, for example, in the church\nof Saint Luigi in Naples, namely, two bottles full of the milk of the\nBlessed Virgin; and this milk becomes fluid on feast-days of the\nMadonna, as everybody can see. Also in this convent of Mater Domini the\nmilk sometimes liquefies.” During eruptions of Vesuvius this bottle is\ncarried abroad in procession, and always dispels the danger. Saint\nJanuarius must indeed look to his laurels! Meanwhile it is interesting\nto observe that the Mother of God has condescended to employ the method\nof holy relics which she once combated so strenuously, her milk\ncompeting with the blood of Saint John, the fat of Saint Laurence, and\nthose other physiological curios which are still preserved for the\nedification of believers.",
        "All of which would pass if a subtle poison had not been creeping in to\ntaint religious institutions. Taken by themselves, these infantile\nobservances do not necessarily harm family life, the support of the\nstate; for a man can believe a considerable deal of nonsense, and yet go\nabout his daily work in a natural and cheerful manner. But when the body\nis despised and tormented the mind loses its equilibrium, and when that\nhappens nonsense may assume a sinister shape. We have seen it in\nEngland, where, during the ascetic movement of Puritanism, more witches\nwere burnt than in the whole period before and after.",
        "The virus of asceticism entered South Italy from three principal\nsources. From early ages the country had stood in commercial relations\nwith the valley of the Nile; and even as its black magic is largely\ntinged with Egyptian practices, so its magic of the white kind–its\nsaintly legends–bear the impress of the self-macerations and perverted\nlife-theories of those desert-lunatics who called themselves Christians.\n[Footnote: These ascetics were here before Christianity (see Philo\nJudaeus); in fact, there is not a single element in the new faith which\nhad not been independently developed by the pagans, many of whom, like\nSeneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius, were ripe for the most abject\nself-abasement.] But this Orientalism fell at first upon unfruitful\nsoil; the Vatican was yet wavering, and Hellenic notions of\nconduct still survived. It received a further rebuff at the hands of men\nlike Benedict, who set up sounder ideals of holiness, introducing a\ngleam of sanity even in that insanest of institutions–the herding\ntogether of idle men to the glory of God.",
        "But things became more centralized as the Papacy gainedground. The\nstrong Christian, the independent ruler or warrior or builder saint, was\ntolerated only if he conformed to its precepts; and the inauspicious\nrise of subservient ascetic orders like the Franciscans and Dominicans,\nwho quickly invaded the fair regions of the south, gave an evil tone to\ntheir Christianity.",
        "There has always been a contrary tendency at work: the Ionic spirit,\nheritage of the past. Monkish ideals of chastity and poverty have never\nappealed to the hearts of people, priests or prelates of the south; they\nwill endure much fondness in their religion, but not those phenomena of\ncruelty and pruriency which are inseparably connected with asceticism;\ntheir notions have ever been akin to those of the sage Xenocrates, who\nheld that “happiness consists not only in the possession of human\nvirtues, but in the accomplishment of natural acts.” Among the latter\nthey include the acquisition of wealth and the satisfaction of carnal\nneeds. At this time, too, the old Hellenic curiosity was not wholly\ndimmed; they took an intelligent interest in imported creeds like that\nof Luther, which, if not convincing, at least satisfied their desire for\nnovelty. Theirs was exactly the attitude of the Athenians towards Paul’s\n\"New God\"; and Protestantism might have spread far in the south, had it\nnot been ferociously repressed.",
        "But after the brilliant humanistic period of the Aragons there followed\nthe third and fiercest reaction–that of the Spanish viceroys, whose\nmisrule struck at every one of the roots of national prosperity. It is\nthat “seicentismo” which a modern writer (A. Niceforo, “L’Italia\nbarbara,” 1898) has recognized as the blight, the evil genius, of south\nItaly. The Ionic spirit did not help the people much at this time. The\ngreatest of these viceroys, Don Pietro di Toledo, hanged 18,000 of them\nin eight years, and then confessed, with a sigh, that “he did not know\nwhat more he could do.” What more could he do? As a pious Spaniard he\nwas incapable of understanding that quarterings and breakings on the\nrack were of less avail than the education of the populace in certain\nsecular notions of good conduct–notions which it was the business of\nhis Church not to teach. Reading through the legislation of the\nviceregal period, one is astonished to find how little was done for the\ncommon people, who lived like the veriest beasts of earth.",
        "Their civil rulers–scholars and gentlemen, most of them–really\nbelieved that the example of half a million illiterate and vicious monks\nwas all the education they needed. And yet one notes with surprise that\nthe Government was perpetually at loggerheads with the ecclesiastical\nauthorities. True; but it is wonderful with what intuitive alacrity they\njoined forces when it was a question of repelling their common\nantagonist, enlightenment.",
        "From this rank soil there sprang up an exotic efflorescence of holiness.\nIf south Italy swarmed with sinners, as the experiences of Don Pietro\nseemed to show, it also swarmed with saints. And hardly one of them\nescaped the influence of the period, the love of futile ornamentation.\nTheir piety is overloaded with embellishing touches and needless\nexcrescences of virtue. It was the baroque period of saintliness, as of\narchitecture.",
        "I have already given some account of one of them, the Flying Monk\n(Chapter X), and have perused the biographies of at least fifty others.\nOne cannot help observing a great uniformity in their lives–a kind of\nfamily resemblance. This parallelism is due to the simple reason that\nthere is only one right for a thousand wrongs. One may well look in\nvain, here, for those many-tinted perversions and aberrations which\ndisfigure the histories of average mankind. These saints are all\nalike–monotonously alike, if one cares to say so–in their chastity and\nother official virtues. But a little acquaintance with the subject will\nsoon show you that, so far as the range of their particular Christianity\nallowed of it, there is a praiseworthy and even astonishing diversity\namong them. Nearly all of them could fly, more or less; nearly all of\nthem could cure diseases and cause the clouds to rain; nearly all of\nthem were illiterate; and every one of them died in the odour of\nsanctity–with roseate complexion, sweetly smelling corpse, and flexible\nlimbs. Yet each one has his particular gifts, his strong point. Joseph\nof Copertino specialized in flying; others were conspicuous for their\nheroism in sitting in hot baths, devouring ordure, tormenting themselves\nwith pins, and so forth.",
        "Here, for instance, is a good representative biography–the Life of\nSaint Giangiuseppe della Croce (born 1654), reprinted for the occasion\nof his solemn sanctification. [Footnote: “Vita di S. Giangiuseppe della\nCroce . . . Scritta dal P. Fr. Diodato dell’ Assunta per la\nBeatificazione ed ora ristampata dal postulatore della causa P. Fr.\nGiuseppe Rostoll in occasione della solenne Santificazione.” Roma,\n1839.]",
        "He resembled other saints in many points. He never allowed the “vermin\nwhich generated in his bed” to be disturbed; he wore the same clothes\nfor sixty-four years on end; with women his behaviour was that of an\n\"animated statue,” and during his long life he never looked any one in\nthe face (even his brother-monks were known to him only by their\nvoices); he could raise the dead, relieve a duchess of a devil in the\nshape of a black dog, change chestnuts into apricots, and bad wine into\ngood; his flesh was encrusted with sores, the result of his fierce\nscarifications; he was always half starved, and when delicate viands\nwere brought to him, he used to say to his body: “Have you seen them?\nHave you smelt them? Then let that suffice for you.”",
        "He, too, could fly a little. So once, when he was nowhere to be found,\nthe monks of the convent at last discovered him in the church, “raised\nso high above the ground that his head touched the ceiling.” This is not\na bad performance for a mere lad, as he then was. And how useful this\ngift became in old age was seen when, being almost incapable of moving\nhis legs, and with body half paralysed, he was nevertheless enabled to\naccompany a procession for the length of two miles on foot, walking, to\nthe stupefaction of thousands of spectators, at about a cubit’s height\nabove the street, on air; after the fashion of those Hindu gods whose\nfeet–so the pagans fable–are too pure to touch mortal earth.",
        "His love of poverty, moreover, was so intense that even after his death\na picture of him, which his relatives had tried to attach to the wall in\nloving remembrance, repeatedly fell down again, although nailed very\nsecurely; nor did it remain fixed until they realized that its costly\ngilt frame was objectionable to the saint in heaven, and accordingly\nremoved it. No wonder the infant Jesus was pleased to descend from the\nbreast of Mary and take rest for several hours in the arms of Saint\nGiangiuseppe, who, on being disturbed by some priestly visitor,\nexclaimed, “O how I have enjoyed holding the Holy Babe in my arms!” This\nis an old and favourite motif; it occurs, for example, in the Fioretti\nof Saint Francis; there are precedents, in fact, for all these divine\nfavours.",
        "But his distinguishing feature, his “dominating gift,” was that of\nprophecy, especially in foretelling the deaths of children, “which he\nalmost always accompanied with jocular words (scherzi) on his lips.\"\nHe would enter a house and genially remark: “O, what an odour of\nParadise “; sooner or later one or more of the children of the family\nwould perish. To a boy of twelve he said, “Be good, Natale, for the\nangels are coming to take you.” These playful words seem to have weighed\nconsiderably on the boy’s mind and, sure enough, after a few years he\ndied. But even more charming–piu grazioso, the biographer calls\nit–was the incident when he once asked a father whether he would give\nhis son to Saint Pasquale. The fond parent agreed, thinking that the\nwords referred to the boy’s future career in the Church. But the saint\nmeant something quite different–he meant a career in heaven! And in\nless than a month the child died. To a little girl who was crying in the\nstreet he said: “I don’t want to hear you any more. Go and sing in\nParadise.” And meeting her a short time after, he said, “What, are you\nstill here?” In a few days she was dead.",
        "The biography gives many instances of this pretty gift which would\nhardly have contributed to the saint’s popularity in England or any\nother country save this, where–although the surviving youngsters are\ndescribed as “struck with terror at the mere name of the Servant of\nGod\"–the parents were naturally glad to have one or two angels in the\nfamily, to act as avvocati (pleaders) for those that remained on earth.",
        "And the mention of the legal profession brings me to one really\ninstructive miracle. It is usually to be observed, after a saint has\nbeen canonized, that heaven, by some further sign or signs, signifies\napproval of this solemn act of the Vicar of God; indeed, to judge by\nthese biographies, such a course is not only customary but, to use a\nworldly expression, de rigueur. And so it happened after the decree\nrelative to Saint Giangiuseppe had been pronounced in the Vatican\nbasilica by His Holiness Pius VI, in the presence of the assembled\ncardinals. Innumerable celestial portents (their enumeration fills\neleven pages of the “Life”) confirmed and ratified the great event, and\namong them this: the notary, who had drawn up both the ordinary and the\napostolic processi, was cured of a grievous apoplexy, survived for\nfour years, and finally died on the very anniversary of the death of the\nsaint. Involuntarily one contrasts this heavenly largesse with the\nsordid guineas which would have contented an English lawyer. . . .",
        "Or glance into the biography of the Venerable Sister Orsola Benincasa.\nShe, too, could fly a little and raise men from the dead. She cured\ndiseases, foretold her own death and that of others, lived for a month\non the sole nourishment of a consecrated wafer; she could speak Latin\nand Polish, although she had been taught nothing at all; wrought\nmiracles after death, and possessed to a heroic degree the virtues of\npatience, humility, temperance, justice, etc. etc. So inflamed was she\nwith divine love, that almost every day thick steam issued out of her\nmouth, which was observed to be destructive to articles of clothing; her\nheated body, when ice was applied, used to hiss like a red-hot iron\nunder similar conditions.",
        "As a child, she already cried for other people’s sins; she was always\nhunting for her own and would gladly, at the end of her long and\nblameless career, have exchanged her sins for those of the youthful\nDuchess of Aquaro. An interesting phenomenon, by the way, the theory of\nsinfulness which crops up at this particular period of history. For our\nconception of sin is alien to the Latin mind. There is no “sin” in Italy\n(and this is not the least of her many attractions); it is an article\nmanufactured exclusively for export. [Footnote: “Vita della Venerabile\nServa di Dio Suor Orsola Benincasa, Scritta da un cherico regolare,\"\nRome, 1796. There are, of course, much earlier biographies of all these\nsaints; concerning Sister Orsola we possess, for instance, the\nremarkable pamphlet by Cesare d’Eboli (\"Caesaris Aevoli Neapolitan!\nApologia pro Ursula Neapolitana quas ad urbem accessit MDLXXXIII,\"\nVenice, 1589), which achieves the distinction of never mentioning Orsola\nby name: she is only once referred to as “mulier de qua agitur.” But I\nprefer to quote from the more recent ones because they are\nauthoritative, in so far as they have been written on the basis of\nmiracles attested by eye-witnesses and accepted as veracious by the\nVatican tribunal. Sister Orsola, though born in 154.7, was only declared\nVenerable by Pontifical decree of 1793. Biographies prior to that date\nare therefore ex-parte statements and might conceivably contain errors\nof fact. This is out of the question here, as is clearly shown by the\nauthor on p. 178.]",
        "Orsola’s speciality, however, were those frequent trance-like conditions\nby reason of which, during her lifetime, she was created “Protectress of\nthe City of Naples.” I cannot tell whether she was the first woman-saint\nto obtain this honour. Certainly the “Seven Holy Protectors” concerning\nwhom Paolo Regio writes were all musty old males. . . .",
        "And here is quite another biography, that of Alfonso di Liguori (born\n1696), the founder of the Redemptorist order and a canonized saint. He,\ntoo, could fly a little and raise the dead to life; he suffered\ndevil-temptations, caused the clouds to rain, calmed an eruption of\nVesuvius, multiplied food, and so forth. Such was his bashfulness, that\neven as an aged bishop he refused to be unrobed by his attendants; such\nhis instinct for moral cleanliness that once, when a messenger had\nalighted at his convent accompanied by a soldier, he instantly detected,\nunder the military disguise, the lineaments of a young woman-friend.\nDespite these divine gifts, he always needed a confessor. An enormous\nbatch of miracles accompanied his sanctification.",
        "But he only employed these divine graces by the way; he was by\nprofession not a taumaturgo, but a clerical instructor, organizer,\nand writer. The Vatican has conferred on him the rare title of “Doctor\nEcclesia,” which he shares with Saint Augustine and some others.",
        "The biography from which I have drawn these details was printed in Rome\nin 1839. It is valuable because it is modern and so far authentic; and\nfor two other reasons. In the first place, curiously enough, it barely\nmentions the saint’s life-work–his writings. Secondly, it is a good\nexample of what I call the pious palimpsest. It is over-scored with\ncontradictory matter. The author, for example, while accidentally\ninforming us that Alfonso kept a carriage, imputes to him a degrading,\nOriental love of dirt and tattered garments, in order (I presume) to\nmake his character conform to the grosser ideals of the mendicant\nfriars. I do not believe in these traits–in his hatred of soap and\nclean apparel. From his works I deduce a different original. He was\nrefined and urbane; of a casuistical and prying disposition; like many\nsensitive men, unduly preoccupied with the sexual life of youth; like a\ntrue feudal aristocrat, ever ready to apply force where verbal\nadmonition proved unavailing. . . .",
        "In wonder-working capacities these saints were all put in the shade by\nthe Calabrian Francesco di Paola, who raised fifteen persons from the\ndead in his boyhood. He used to perform a hundred miracles a day, and\n\"it was a miracle, when a day passed without a miracle.” The index alone\nof any one of his numerous biographies is enough to make one’s head swim.",
        "The vast majority of saints of this period do not belong to that third\nsex after which, according to some, the human race has ever striven–the\nconstructive and purposeful third sex. They are wholly sexless, unsocial\nand futile beings, the negation of every masculine or feminine virtue.\nTheir independence fettered by the iron rules of the Vatican and of\ntheir particular order, these creatures had nothing to do; and like\nthe rest of us under such conditions, became vacuously introspective.\nThose honourable saintly combats of the past with external enemies and\nplagues and stormy seasons were transplanted from without into the\nmicrocosm within, taking the shape of hallucinations and\ndemon-temptations. They were no longer actors, but sufferers; automata,\nwho attained a degree of inanity which would have made their old\nByzantine prototypes burst with envy.",
        "Yet they vary in their gifts; each one, as I have said, has his or her\nstrong point. Why? The reason of this diversity lies in the furious\ncompetition between the various monastic orders of the time–in those\nunedifying squabbles which led to never-ending litigation and complaints\nto head-quarters in Rome. Every one of these saints, from the first\ndawning of his divine talents, was surrounded by an atmosphere of\njealous hatred on the part of his co-religionists. If one order came out\nwith a flying wonder, another, in frantic emulation, would introduce\nsome new speciality to eclipse his fame–something in the fasting line,\nit may be; or a female mystic whose palpitating letters to Jesus Christ\nwould melt all readers to pity. The Franciscans, for instance, dissected\nthe body of a certain holy Margaret and discovered in her heart the\nsymbols of the Trinity and of the Passion. This bold and original idea\nwould have gained them much credit, but for the rival Dominicans, who\npromptly discovered, and dissected, another saintly Margaret, whose\nheart contained three stones on which were engraven portraits of the\nVirgin Mary. [Footnote: These and other details will be found in the\nfour volumes “Das Heidentum in der romischen Kirche” (Gotha, 1889-91),\nby Theodor Trede, a late Protestant parson in Naples, strongly tinged\nwith anti-Catholicism, but whose facts may be relied upon. Indeed, he\ngives chapter and verse for them.] So they ceaselessly unearthed fresh\nsaints with a view to disparaging each other–all of them waiting for a\nfavourable moment when the Vatican could be successfully approached to\nconsider their particular claims. For it stands to reason that a\nCarmelite Pope would prefer a Carmelite saint to one of the Jesuits, and\nso forth.",
        "And over all throned the Inquisition in Rome, alert, ever-suspicious;\ntesting the “irregularities” of the various orders and harassing their\nrespective saints with Olympic impartiality.",
        "I know that mystics such as Orsola Benincasa are supposed to have\nanother side to their character, an eminently practical side. It is\nperfectly true–and we need not go out of England to learn it–that\npiety is not necessarily inconsistent with nimbleness in worldly\naffairs. But the mundane achievements, the monasteries and churches, of\nnine-tenths of these southern ecstatics are the work of the confessor\nand not of the saint. Trainers of performing animals are aware how these\ndiffer in plasticity of disposition and amenability to discipline; the\nspiritual adviser, who knows his business, must be quick to detect these\nvarious qualities in the minds of his penitents and to utilize them to\nthe best advantage. It is inconceivable, for instance, that the\nconvent-foundress Orsola was other than a neuropathic nonentity–a blind\ninstrument in the hands of what we should call her backers, chiefest of\nwhom (in Naples) were two Spanish priests, Borii and Navarro, whose\nlocal efforts were supported, at head-quarters, by the saintly Filippo\nNeri and the learned Cardinal Baronius.",
        "This is noticeable. The earlier of these godly biographies are written\nin Latin, and these are more restrained in their language; they were\ncomposed, one imagines, for the priests and educated classes who could\ndispense to a certain degree with prodigies. But the later ones, from\nthe viceregal period onwards, are in the vernacular and display a marked\ndeterioration; one must suppose that they were printed for such of the\ncommon people as could still read (up to a few years ago, sixty-five per\ncent of the populace were analphabetic). They are pervaded by the\ncharacteristic of all contemporary literature and art: that deliberate\nintention to astound which originated with the poet Marino, who\ndeclared such to have been his object and ideal. The miracles certainly\ndo astound; they are as strepitosi (clamour-arousing) as the writers\nclaim them to be; how they ever came to occur must be left to the\nconsciences of those who swore on oath to the truth of them.",
        "During this period the Mother of God as a local saint increased in\npopularity. There was a ceaseless flow of monographs dealing with\nparticular Madonnas, as well as a small library on what the Germans\nwould doubtless call the “Madonna as a Whole.” Here is Serafino\nMontorio’s “Zodiaco di Maria,” printed in 1715 on the lines of that\nmonster of a book by Gumppenberg. It treats of over two hundred\nsubspecies of Madonna worshipped in different parts of south Italy which\nis divided, for these celestial purposes, into twelve regions, according\nto the signs of the Zodiac. The book is dedicated by the author to his\n\"Sovereign Lady the Gran Madre di Dio” and might, in truth, have been\nwritten to the glory of that protean old Magna Mater by one of Juvenal’s\n\"tonsured herd” possessed of much industry but little discrimination.\n[Footnote: The Mater Dei was officially installed in the place of Magna\nMater at the Synod of Ephesus in 431.] Such as it is, it reflects the\ncrude mental status of the Dominican order to which the author belonged.\nI warmly recommend this book to all Englishmen desirous of understanding\nthe south. It is pure, undiluted paganism–paganism of a bad school; one\nwould think it marked the lowest possible ebb of Christian spirituality.\nBut this is by no means the case, as I shall presently show.",
        "How different, from such straightforward unreason, are the etherealized,\nsaccharine effusions of the “Glories of Mary,” by Alfonso di Liguori!\nThey represent the other pole of Mariolatry–the gentlemanly pole. And\nunder the influence of Mary-worship a new kind of saintly physiognomy\nwas elaborated, as we can see from contemporary prints and pictures. The\nbearded men-saints were extinct; in the place of them this mawkish,\nsub-sexual love for the Virgin developed a corresponding type of\nadorer–clean-shaven, emasculate youths, posing in ecstatic attitudes\nwith a nauseous feminine smirk. Rather an unpleasant sort of saint.",
        "The unwholesome chastity-ideal, without which no holy man of the period\nwas “complete,” naturally left its mark upon literature, notably on that\nof certain Spanish theologians. But good specimens of what I mean may\nalso be found in the Theologia Moralis of Liguori; the kind of stuff,\nthat is, which would be classed as “curious” in catalogues and kept in a\nlocked cupboard by the most broad-minded paterfamilias. Reading these\nelucubrations of Alfonso’s, one feels that the saint has pondered long\nand lovingly upon themes like an et quando peccata sint oscula or de\ntactu et adspectu corporis; he writes with all the authority of an\nexpert whose richly-varied experiences in the confessional have been\namplified and irradiated by divine inspiration. I hesitate what to call\nthis literature, seeing that it was obviously written to the glory of\nGod and His Virgin Mother. The congregation of the Index, which was\nsevere in the matter of indecent publications and prohibited Boccaccio’s\nDecameron on these grounds, hailed with approval the appearance of such\ntreatises composed, as they were, for the guidance of young priests.",
        "Cruelty (in the shape of the Inquisition) and lasciviousness (as\nexemplified by such pious filth)–these are the prime fruits of that\ncult of asceticism which for centuries the Government strove to impose\nupon south Italy. If the people were saved, it was due to that\nsubstratum of sanity, of Greek sophrosyne, which resisted the one and\nderided the other. Whoever has saturated himself with the records will\nmarvel not so much that the inhabitants preserved some shreds of common\nsense and decent feeling, as that they survived at all–he will marvel\nthat the once fair kingdom was not converted into a wilderness, saintly\nbut uninhabited, like Spain itself.",
        "For the movement continued in a vertiginous crescendo. Spaniardism\nculminated in Bourbonism, and this, again, reached its climax in the\nclosing years of the eighteenth century, when the conditions of south\nItaly baffled description. I have already (p. 212) given the formidable\nnumber of its ecclesiastics; the number of saints was commensurate,\nbut–as often happens when the quantity is excessive–the quality\ndeclined. This lazzaroni-period was the debacle of holiness. So true it\nis that our gods reflect the hearts that make them.",
        "The Venerable Fra Egidio, a native of Taranto, is a good example of\ncontemporary godliness. My biography of him was printed in Naples in\n1876, [Footnote: “Vita del Venerabile servo di Dio Fra Egidio da S.\nGiuseppe laico professo alcantarino,” Napoli, 1876.] and contains a\ndedicatory epistle addressed to the Blessed Virgin by her “servant,\nsubject, and most loving son Rosario Frungillo\"–a canon of the church\nand the author of the book.",
        "This “taumaturgo” could perform all the ordinary feats; I will not\nlinger over them. What has made him popular to this day are those\nwonders which appealed to the taste of the poorer people, such as, for\nexample, that miracle of the eels. A fisherman had brought fourteen\nhundredweight of these for sale in the market. Judge of his\ndisappointment when he discovered that they had all died during the\njourney (southerners will not pay for dead eels). Fortunately, he saw\nthe saint arriving in a little boat, who informed him that the eels were\n\"not dead, but only asleep,” and who woke them up again by means of a\nrelic of Saint Pasquale which he always carried about with him, after a\nquarter of an hour’s devout praying, during which the perspiration oozed\nfrom his forehead. The eels, says the writer, had been dead and slimy,\nbut now turned their bellies downwards once more and twisted about in\ntheir usual spirals; there began a general weeping among the onlookers,\nand the fame of the miracle immediately spread abroad. He could do the\nsame with lobsters, cows, and human beings.",
        "Thus a cow belonging to Fra Egidio’s monastery was once stolen by an\nimpious butcher, and cut up into the usual joints with a view to a\nclandestine sale of the meat. The saint discovered the beast’s remains,\nordered that they should be laid together on the floor in the shape of a\nliving cow, with the entrails, head and so forth in their natural\npositions; then, having made the sign of the cross with his cord upon\nthe slaughtered beast, and rousing up all his faith, he said: “In the\nname of God and of Saint Pasquale, arise, Catherine!” (Catherine was the\ncow’s name.) “At these words the animal lowed, shook itself, and stood\nup on its feet alive, whole and strong, even as it had been before it\nwas killed.”",
        "In the case of one of the dead men whom he brought to life, the\nundertakers were already about their sad task; but Fra Egidio, viewing\nthe corpse, remarked in his usual manner that the man was “not dead, but\nonly asleep,” and after a few saintly manipulations, roused him from his\nslumber. The most portentous of his wonders, however, are those which he\nwrought after his own death by means of his relics and otherwise; they\nhave been sworn to by many persons. Nor did his hand lose its old\ncunning, in these posthumous manifestations, with the finny tribe. A\ncertain woman, Maria Scuotto, was enabled to resuscitate a number of\ndead eels by means of an image of the deceased saint which she cast\namong them.",
        "Every one of the statements in this biography is drawn from the\nprocessi to which I will presently refer; there were 202 witnesses who\ndeposed “under the rigour and sanctity of oath” to the truth of these\nmiracles; and among those who were personally convinced of the\nVenerable’s rare gifts was the Royal Family of Naples, the archbishop of\nthat town, as well as innumerable dukes and princes. An embittered\nrationalist would note that the reading of Voltaire, at this period, was\npunished with three years’ galley-slavery and that several thousand\ncitizens were hanged for expressing liberal opinions; he will suggest\nthat belief in the supernatural, rejected by the thinking classes, finds\nan abiding shelter among royalty and the proletariat.",
        "It occurs to me, a propos of Fra Egidio, to make the obvious statement\nthat an account of an occurrence is not necessarily true, because it\nhappened long ago. Credibility does not improve, like violins and port\nwine, with lapse of years. This being the case, it will not be\nconsidered objectionable to say that there are certain deeds attributed\nto holy men of olden days which, to speak frankly, are open to doubt; or\nat least not susceptible of proof. Who were these men, if they ever\nexisted? and who vouches for their prodigies? This makes me think that\nPope Gelasius showed no small penetration in excluding, as early as the\nfifth century, some few acta sanctorum from the use of the churches;\nanother step in the same direction was taken in the twelfth century when\nthe power of canonizing saints, which had hitherto been claimed by all\nbishops, became vested in the Pope alone; and yet another, when Urban\nVIII forbade the nomination of local patron saints by popular vote.\nPious legends are supposed to have their uses as an educative agency. So\nbe it. But such relations of imperfectly ascertained and therefore\nquestionable wonders suffer from one grave drawback: they tend to shake\nour faith in the evidence of well-authenticated ones. Thus Saint Patrick\nis also reported to have raised a cow from the dead–five cows, to be\nquite accurate; but who will come forward and vouch for the fact? No\none. That is because Saint Patrick belongs to the legendary stage; he\ndied, it is presumed, about 490.",
        "Here, with Saint Egidio, we are on other ground; on the ground of bald\nactuality. He expired in 1812, and the contemporaries who have attested\nhis miraculous deeds are not misty phantoms of the Thebais; they were\ncreatures of flesh and blood, human, historical personages, who were\ndressed and nourished and educated after the fashion of our own\ngrandfathers. Yet it was meet and proper that the documentary evidence\nas to his divine graces should be conscientiously examined. And only in\n1888 was the crowning work accomplished. In that year His Holiness Leo\nXIII and the Sacred Congregation of Cardinals solemnly approved the\nevidence and inscribed the name of Egidio in the book of the Blessed.",
        "To touch upon a few minor matters–I observe that Fra Egidio, like the\nFlying Monk, was “illiterate,” and similarly preserved up to a decrepit\nage “the odorous lily of purity, which made him appear in words and\ndeeds as a most innocent child.” He was accustomed to worship before a\nfavourite picture of the Mother of God which he kept adorned with\ncandles; and whenever the supply of these ran out, he was wont to\naddress Her with infantile simplicity of heart and in the local dialect:\n\"Now there’s no wax for You; so think about it Yourself; if not, You’ll\nhave to go without.” The playful-saintly note. . . .",
        "But there is this difference between him and earlier saints that whereas\nthey, all too often, suffered in solitude, misunderstood and rejected of\nmen, he enjoyed the highest popularity during his whole long life.\nWherever he went, his footsteps were pursued by crowds of admirers,\neager to touch his wonder-working body or to cut off shreds of his\nclothing as amulets; hardly a day passed that he did not return home\nwith garments so lacerated that only half of them was left; every\nevening they had to be patched up anew, although they were purposely\nstitched full of wires and small chains of iron as a protection. The\nsame passionate sympathy continued after death, for while his body was\nlying in state a certain Luigi Ascione, a surgeon, pushed through the\ncrowd and endeavoured to cut off one of his toe-nails with the flesh\nattached to it; he admitted being driven to this act of pious\ndepredation by the pleading request of the Spanish Ambassador and a\nNeapolitan princess, who held Fra Egidio in great veneration.",
        "This is not an isolated instance. Southerners love their saints, and do\nnot content themselves with chill verbal expressions of esteem. So the\nbiographer of Saint Giangiuseppe records that “one of the deceased\nsaint’s toes was bitten off with most regret-able devotion by the teeth\nof a man in the crowd, who wished to preserve it as a relic. And the\nblood from the wound flowed so copiously and so freely that many pieces\nof cloth were saturated with it; nor did it cease to flow till the\nprecious corpse was interred.” It is hard to picture such proofs of\nfervid popularity falling to the lot of English deans and bishops.",
        "He was modern, too, in this sense, that he did not torment himself with\npenitences (decay of Spanish austerity); on the contrary, he even kept\nchocolate, honey and suchlike delicacies in his cell. In short, he was\nan up-to-date saint, who despised mediaeval practices and lived in a\nmanner befitting the age which gave him birth. In this respect he\nresembles our English men of holiness, who exercise a laudable\nself-denial in resisting the seductions of the ascetic life.",
        "Meanwhile, the cult of the Mother of God continued to wax in favour, and\nthose who are interested in its development should read the really\nremarkable book by Antonio Cuomo, “Saggio apologetico della belezza\nceleste e divina di Maria S.S. Madre di Dio” (Castellamare, 1863). It is\na diatribe against modernism by a champion of lost causes, an\nexacerbated lover of the “Singular Virgin and fecund Mother of the\nVerb.” His argument, as I understand it, is the consensus gentium\ntheory applied to the Virgin Mary. In defence of this thesis, the book\nhas been made to bristle with quotations; they stand out like quills\nupon the porcupine, ready to impale the adventurous sceptic. Pliny and\nVirgil and the Druids and Balaam’s Ass are invoked as foretelling Her\nbirth; the Old Testament–that venerable sufferer, as Huxley called\nit–is twisted into dire convulsions for the same purpose; much evidence\nis also drawn from Hebrew observances and from the Church Fathers. But\nthe New Testamentary record is seldom invoked; the Saviour, on the rare\noccasions when He is mentioned, being dismissed as “G. C.” The volume\nends with a pyrotechnical display of invective against non-Catholic\nheretics; a medley of threats and abuse worthy of those breezy days of\nErasmus, when theologians really said what they thought of each other.\nThe frank polytheism of Montorio is more to my taste. This outpouring of\npapistical rhetoric gives me unwarrantable sensations–it makes me feel\npositively Protestant.",
        "Another sign of increasing popularity is that the sacred bacchanals\nconnected with the “crowning” of various Madonnas were twice as\nnumerous, in Naples, in the nineteenth as in the eighteenth century. Why\nan image of the Mother of God should be decked with this worldly symbol,\nas a reward for services rendered, will be obscure only to those who\nfail to appreciate the earthly-tangible complexion of southern religion.\nPuerility is its key-note. The Italian is either puerile or adult; the\nEnglishman remains everlastingly adolescent. . . .",
        "Now of course it is open to any one to say that the pious records from\nwhich I have quoted are a desolation of the spirit; that they possess\nall the improbability of the “Arabian Nights,” and none of their charm;\nthat all the distempered dreamings to which our poor humanity is subject\nhave given themselves a rendezvous in their pages. I am not for\ndisputing the point, and I can understand how one man may be saddened by\ntheir perusal, while another extracts therefrom some gleams of mirth.\nFor my part, I merely verify this fact: the native has been fed with\nthis stuff for centuries, and if we desire to enter into his feelings,\nwe must feed ourselves likewise–up to a point. The past is the key to\nthe present. That is why I have dwelt at such length on the subject–in\nthe hope of clearing up the enigma in the national character: the\nunpassable gulf, I mean, between the believing and the unbelieving\nsections of the community.",
        "An Anglo-Saxon arriving at Bagnara and witnessing a procession in honour\nof that Sacred Hat of the Mother of God which has led me into this\ndisquisition, would be shocked at the degree of bigotry implied. “The\nHat of the Virgin Mary,” he would say–\"what next?” Then, accosting some\nordinary citizen not in the procession–any butcher or baker–he would\nreceive a shock of another kind; he would be appalled at the man’s\nlanguage of contemptuous derision towards everything which he, the\nAnglo-Saxon, holds sacred in biblical tradition. There is no attempt,\nhere, at “reconciliation.” The classes calling themselves enlightened\nare making a clean sweep of the old gods in a fashion that bewilders us\nwho have accustomed ourselves to see a providential design in everything\nthat exists (possibly because our acquaintance with a providentially-\ndesigned Holy Office is limited to an obsolete statute, the genial\nde haeretico comburendo). The others, the fetishists, have\nremained on the spiritual level of their own saints. And there we stand\ntoday. That section so numerous in England, the pseudo-pagans,\ncrypto-Christians, or whatever obscurantists like Messrs. A. J. Balfour\nand Mallock like to call themselves (the men who, with disastrous\neffects, transport into realms of pure intelligence the spirit of\ncompromise which should be restricted to practical concerns)–that\nsection has no representatives hereabouts.",
        "Fully to appreciate their attitude as opposed to ours, we must also\nremember that the south Italian does not trouble himself about the\nobjective truth of any miracle whatever; his senses may be perverted,\nbut his intelligence remains outside the sphere of infection. This is\nhis saving grace. To the people here, the affair of Moses and the\nBurning Bush, the raising of Lazarus, and Egidio’s cow-revival, are on\nthe identical plane of authenticity; the Bible is one of a thousand\nsaints’ books; its stories may be as true as theirs, or just as untrue;\nin any case, what has that to do with his own worldly conduct? But the\nEnglishman with ingenuous ardour thinks to believe in the Burning Bush\nwonder, and in so far his intelligence is infected; with equal ardour he\nexcludes the cow-performance from the range of possibility; and to him\nit matters considerably which of the miracles are true and which are\nfalse, seeing that his conduct is supposed to take colour from such\nsupernatural events. Ultra-credulous as to one set of narratives, he has\nno credulity left for other sets; he concentrates his believing energies\nupon a small space, whereas the Italian’s are diffused, thinly, over a\nwide area. It is the old story: Gothic intensity and Latin spaciousness.\nSo the Gothic believer takes his big dose of irrationalism on one fixed\nday; the Latin, by attending Mass every morning, spreads it over the\nwhole week. And the sombre strenuousness of our northern character\nexpects a remuneration for this outlay of faith, while the other\ncontents himself with such sensuous enjoyment as he can momentarily\nextract from his ceremonials. That is why our English religion has a\ndemocratic tinge distasteful to the Latin who, at bottom, is always a\nphilosopher; democratic because it relies for its success, like\ndemocratic politicians, upon promises–promises that may or may not be\nkept–promises that form no part (they are only an official appendage)\nof the childlike paganism of the south. . . .",
        "Fifteen francs will buy you a reliable witness for a south Italian\nlawsuit; you must pay a good deal more in England. Thence one might\nargue that the cult of credulity implied by these saintly biographies is\nresponsible for this laxness, for the general disregard of veracity. I\ndoubt it. I am not inclined to blame the monkish saint-makers for this\nparticular trait; I suspect that for fifteen francs you could have\nbought a first-class witness under Pericles. Southerners are not yet\npressed for time; and when people are not pressed for time, they do not\nlearn the time-saving value of honesty. Our respect for truth and fair\ndealing, such as it is, derives from modern commerce; in the Middle Ages\nnobody was concerned about honesty save a few trading companies like the\nHanseatic League, and the poor mediaeval devil (the only gentleman of\nhis age) who was generally pressed for time and could be relied upon to\nkeep his word. Even God, of whom they talked so much, was systematically\nswindled. Where time counts for nothing, expeditious practices between\nman and man are a drug in the market. Besides, it must be noted that\nthis churchly misteaching was only a fraction of that general shattering\nwhich has disintegrated all the finer fibres of public life. It stands\nto reason that the fragile tissues of culture are dislocated, and its\ndelicate edges defaced, by such persistive governmental brutalization as\nthe inhabitants have undergone. None but the grossest elements in a\npeople can withstand enduring misrule; none but a mendacious and servile\nnature will survive its wear and tear. So it comes about that up to a\nfew years ago the nobler qualities which we associate with those old\nHellenic colonists–their intellectual curiosity, their candid outlook\nupon life, their passionate sense of beauty, their love of nature–all\nthese things had been abraded, leaving, as residue, nothing save what\nthe Greeks shared with ruder races. There are indications that this\nstate of affairs is now ending.",
        "The position is this. The records show that the common people never took\ntheir saints to heart in the northern fashion–as moral exemplars; from\nbeginning to end, they have only utilized them as a pretext for fun and\nfestivals, a means of brightening the cata-combic, the essentially\nsunless, character of Christianity. So much for the popular saints, the\npatrons and heroes. The others, the ecclesiastical ones, are an\nartificial product of monkish institutions. These monkeries were\nestablished in the land by virtue of civil authority. Their continued\nexistence, however, was contingent upon the goodwill of the Vatican. One\nof the surest and cheapest methods of obtaining this goodwill was to\nproduce a satisfactory crop of saints whose beatification swelled the\nVatican treasury with the millions collected from a deluded populace for\nthat end. The monks paid nothing; they only furnished the saint and, in\ndue course, the people’s money. Can we wonder that they discovered\nsaints galore? Can we wonder that the Popes were gratified by their\npious zeal?",
        "So things went on till yesterday. But now a large proportion of the ten\nthousand (?) churches and monasteries of Naples are closed or actually\nin ruins; wayside sanctuaries crumble to dust in picturesque fashion;\nthe price of holy books has fallen to zero, and the godly brethren have\nemigrated to establish their saint-manufactories elsewhere. Not without\nhope of success; for they will find purchasers of their wares wherever\nmankind can be interested in that queer disrespect of the body which is\ntaught by the metaphysical ascetics of the East.",
        "It was Lewes, I believe, who compared metaphysics to ghosts by saying\nthat there was no killing either of them; one could only dissipate them\nby throwing light into the dark places they love to inhabit–to show\nthat nothing is there. Spectres, likewise, are these saintly caricatures\nof humanity, perambulating metaphysics, the application in corpore\nvili of Oriental fakirism. Nightmare-literature is the crazy recital of\ntheir deeds and sufferings. Pathological phantoms! The state of mind\nwhich engenders and cherishes such illusions is a disease, and it has\nbeen well said that “you cannot refute a disease.” You cannot nail\nghosts to the counter.",
        "But a ray of light . . .",
        "Day was barely dawning when we left Delianuova and began the long and\nweary climb up Montalto. Chestnuts gave way to beeches, but the summit\nreceded ever further from us. And even before reaching the uplands, the\nso-called Piano di Carmelia, we encountered a bank of bad weather. A\nglance at the map will show that Montalto must be a cloud-gatherer,\ndrawing to its flanks every wreath of vapour that rises from Ionian and\nTyrrhenian; a west wind was blowing that morning, and thick fogs clung\nto the skirts of the peak. We reached the summit (1956 metres) at last,\ndrenched in an icy bath of rain and sleet, and with fingers so numbed\nthat we could hardly hold our sticks.",
        "Of the superb view–for such it must be–nothing whatever was to be\nseen; we were wrapped in a glacial mist. On the highest point stands a\nfigure of the Redeemer. It was dragged up in pieces from Delianuova some\nseven years ago, but soon injured by frosts; it has lately been\nrefashioned. The original structure may be due to the same pious\nstimulus as that which placed the crosses on Monte Vulture and other\npeaks throughout the country–a counterblast to the rationalistic\ncongress at Rome in 1904, when Giordano Bruno became, for a while, the\nhero of the country. This statue does not lack dignity. The Saviour’s\nregard turns towards Reggio, the capital of the province; and one hand\nis upraised in calm and godlike benediction.",
        "Passing through magnificent groves of fir, we descended rapidly into\nanothsr climate, into realms of golden sunshine. Among these trees I\nespied what has become quite a rare bird in Italy–the common\nwood-pigeon. The few that remain have been driven into the most secluded\nrecesses of the mountains; it was different in the days of Theocritus,\nwho sang of this amiable fowl when the climate was colder and the\nwoodlands reached as far as the now barren seashore. To the firs\nsucceeded long stretches of odorous pines interspersed with\nMediterranean heath (brayere), which here grows to a height of twelve\nfeet; one thinks of the number of briar pipes that could be cut out of\nits knotty roots. A British Vice-Consul at Reggio, Mr. Kerrich, started\nthis industry about the year 1899; he collected the roots, which were\nsawn into blocks and then sent to France and America to be made into\npipes. This Calabrian briar was considered superior to the French kind,\nand Mr. Kerrich had large sales on both sides of the Atlantic; his chief\ndifficulty was want of labour owing to emigration.",
        "We passed, by the wayside, several rude crosses marking the site of\naccidents or murders, as well as a large heap of stones, where-under lie\nthe bones of a man who attempted to traverse these mountains in\nwinter-time and was frozen to death.",
        "“They found him,” the guide told me, “in spring, when the snow melted\nfrom off his body. There he lay, all fresh and comely! It looked as if\nhe would presently wake up and continue his march; but he neither spoke\nnor stirred. Then they knew he was dead. And they piled all these stones\nover him, to prevent the wolves, you understand-----”",
        "Aspromonte deserves its name. It is an incredibly harsh agglomeration of\nhill and dale, and the geology of the district, as I learned long ago\nfrom my friend Professor Cortese, reveals a perfect chaos of rocks of\nevery age, torn into gullies by earthquakes and other cataclysms of the\npast–at one place, near Scido, is an old stream of lava. Once the\nhigher ground, the nucleus of the group, is left behind, the wanderer\nfinds himself lost in a maze of contorted ravines, winding about without\nany apparent system of watershed. Does the liquid flow north or south?\nWho can tell! The track crawls in and out of valleys, mounts upwards to\nheights of sun-scorched bracken and cistus, descends once more into dewy\nglades hemmed in by precipices and overhung by drooping fernery. It\ncrosses streams of crystal clearness, rises afresh in endless gyrations\nunder the pines only to vanish, yet again, into the twilight of deeper\nabysses, where it skirts the rivulet along precarious ledges, until some\nnew obstruction blocks the way–so it writhes about for long, long\nhours. . . .",
        "Here, on the spot, one can understand how an outlaw like Musolino was\nenabled to defy justice, helped, as he was, by the fact that the vast\nmajority of the inhabitants were favourable to him, and that the officer\nin charge of his pursuers was paid a fixed sum for every day he spent in\nthe chase and presumably found it convenient not to discover his\nwhereabouts. [Footnote: See next chapter.]",
        "We rested awhile, during these interminable meanderings, under the\nshadow of a group of pines.",
        "“Do you see that square patch yonder?” said my man. “It is a cornfield.\nThere Musolino shot one of his enemies, whom he suspected of giving\ninformation to the police. It was well done.”",
        "“How many did he shoot, altogether?”",
        "“Only eighteen. And three of them recovered, more or less; enough to\nlimp about, at all events. Ah, if you could have seen him, sir! He was\nyoung, with curly fair hair, and a face like a rose. God alone can tell\nhow many poor people he helped in their distress. And any young girl he\nmet in the mountains he would help with her load and accompany as far as\nher home, right into her father’s house, which none of us would have\nrisked, however much we might have liked it. But every one knew that he\nwas pure as an angel.”",
        "“And there was a young fellow here,” he went on, “who thought he could\nprofit by pretending to be Musolino. So one day he challenged a\nproprietor with his gun, and took all his money. When it came to\nMusolino’s ears, he was furious–furious! He lay in wait for him, caught\nhim, and said: ’How dare you touch fathers of children? Where’s that\nmoney you took from Don Antonio?’ Then the boy began to cry and tremble\nfor his life. ’Bring it,’ said Musolino, ’every penny, at midday next\nMonday, to such and such a spot, or else-----’ Of course he brought it.\nThen he marched him straight into the proprietor’s house. ’Here’s this\nwretched boy, who robbed you in my name. And here’s the money: please\ncount it. Now, what shall we do with him?’ So Don Antonio counted the\nmoney. ’It’s all there,’ he said; ’let him off this time.’ Then Musolino\nturned to the lad: ’You have behaved like a mannerless puppy,’ he said,\n’without shame or knowledge of the world. Be reasonable in future, and\nunderstand clearly: I will have no brigandage in these mountains. Leave\nthat to the syndics and judges in the towns.’”",
        "We did not traverse Musolino’s natal village, Santo Stefano; indeed, we\npassed through no villages at all. But after issuing from the labyrinth,\nwe saw a few of them, perched in improbable situations–Roccaforte and\nRoghudi on our right; on the other side, Africo and Casalnuovo. Salis\nMarschlins says that the inhabitants of these regions are so wild and\ninnocent that money is unknown; everything is done by barter. That comes\nof copying without discrimination. For this statement he utilized the\nreport of a Government official, a certain Leoni, who was sent hither\nafter the earthquake of 1783, and found the use of money not unknown,\nbut forgotten, in consequence of this terrible catastrophe.",
        "These vales of Aspromonte are one of the last refuges of living\nByzantinism. Greek is still spoken in some places, such as Rocca-forte\nand Roghudi. Earlier travellers confused the natives with the Albanians;\nNiehbuhr, who had an obsession on the subject of Hellenism, imagined\nthey were relics of old Dorian and Achaean colonies. Scholars are\napparently not yet quite decided upon certain smaller matters. So\nLenormant (Vol. II, p. 433) thinks they came hither after the Turkish\nconquest, as did the Albanians; Batiffol argues that they were chased\ninto Calabria from Sicily by the Arabs after the second half of the\nseventh century; Morosi, who treats mostly of their Apulian settlements,\nsays that they came from the East between the sixth and tenth centuries.\nMany students, such as Morelli and Comparetti, have garnered their\nsongs, language, customs and lore, and whoever wants a convenient resume\nof these earlier researches will find it in Pellegrini’s book which was\nwritten in 1873 (printed 1880). He gives the number of Greek inhabitants\nof these places–Roghudi, for example, had 535 in his day; he has also\nnoted down these villages, like Africo and Casalnuovo, in which the\nByzantine speech has lately been lost. Bova and Condofuri are now the\nhead-quarters of mediaeval Greek in these parts.",
        "From afar we had already descried a green range of hills that shut out\nthe seaward view. This we now began to climb, in wearisome ascension; it\nis called Pie d’lmpisa, because “your feet are all the time on a steep\nincline.” Telegraph wires here accompany the track, a survival of the\nwar between the Italian Government and Musolino. On the summit lies a\nlonely Alp, Campo di Bova, where a herd of cattle were pasturing under\nthe care of a golden-haired youth who lay supine on the grass, gazing at\nthe clouds as they drifted in stately procession across the firmament.\nSave for a dusky charcoal-burner crouching in a cave, this boy was the\nonly living person we encountered on our march–so deserted are these\nmountain tracks.",
        "At Campo di Bova a path branches off to Staiti; the sea is visible once\nmore, and there are fine glimpses, on the left, towards Staiti (or is it\nFerruzzano?) and, down the right, into the destructive and dangerous\ntorrent of Amendolea. Far beyond it, rises the mountain peak of\nPentedattilo, a most singular landmark which looks exactly like a molar\ntooth turned upside down, with fangs in air. The road passes through a\ngateway in the rock whence, suddenly, a full view is disclosed of Bova\non its hill-top, the houses nestling among huge blocks of stone that\nmake one think of some cyclopean citadel of past ages. My guide stoutly\ndenied that this was Bova; the town, he declared, lay in quite another\ndirection. I imagine he had never been beyond the foot of the “Pie\nd’Impisa.”",
        "Here, once more, the late earthquake has done some damage, and there is\na row of trim wooden shelters near the entrance of the town. I may add,\nas a picturesque detail, that about one-third of them have never been\ninhabited, and are never likely to be. They were erected in the heat of\nenthusiasm, and there they will stay, empty and abandoned, until some\nenergetic mayor shall pull them down and cook his maccheroni with their\ntimber.",
        "Evening was drawing on apace, and whether it was due to the joy of\nhaving accomplished an arduous journey, or to inconsiderate potations of\nthe Bacchus of Bova, one of the most remarkable wines in Italy, I very\nsoon found myself on excellent terms with the chief citizens of this\nrather sordid-looking little place. A good deal has been written\nconcerning Bova and its inhabitants, but I should say there is still a\nmine of information to be exploited on the spot. They are bilingual, but\nwhile clinging stubbornly to their old speech, they have now embraced\nCatholicism. The town kept its Greek religious rites till the latter\nhalf of the sixteenth century; and Rodota has described the “vigorous\nresistance” that was made to the introduction of Romanism, and the\nceremonies which finally accompanied that event.",
        "Mine hostess obligingly sang me two or three songs in her native\nlanguage; the priest furnished me with curious statistics of folklore\nand criminology; and the notary, with whom I conversed awhile on the\ntiny piazza that overlooks the coastlands and distant Ionian, was a most\naffable gentleman. Seeing that the Christian names of the populace are\npurely Italian, I enquired as to their surnames, and learned what I\nexpected, namely, that a good many Greek family names survive among the\npeople. His own name, he said, was unquestionably Greek: Condemi; if I\nliked, he would go through the local archives and prepare me a list of\nall such surnames as appeared to him to be non-Italian; we could thus\nobtain some idea of the percentage of Greek families still living here.\nMy best thanks to the good Signor!",
        "After some further liquid refreshment, a youthful native volunteered to\nguide me by short cuts to the remote railway station. We stepped\nblithely into the twilight, and during the long descent I discoursed\nwith him, in fluent Byzantine Greek, of the affairs of his village.",
        "It is my theory that among a populace of this kind the words relative to\nagricultural pursuits will be those which are least likely to suffer\nchange with lapse of years, or to be replaced by others.",
        "Acting on this principle, I put him through a catechism on the subject\nas soon as we reached our destination, and was surprised at the relative\nscarcity of Italian terms–barely 25 per cent I should say. Needless to\nadd, I omitted to note them down. Such as it is, be that my contribution\nto the literature of these sporadic islets of mediaeval Hellenism, whose\noutstanding features are being gnawed away by the waves of military\nconscription, governmental schooling, and emigration.",
        "Caulonia, my next halting-place, lay far off the line. I had therefore\nthe choice of spending the night at Gerace (old Locri) or Rocella\nIonica–intermediate stations. Both of them, to my knowledge, possessing\nindifferent accommodation, I chose the former as being the nearest, and\nslept there, not amiss; far better than on a previous occasion, when\ncertain things occurred which need not be set down here.",
        "The trip from Delianuova over the summit of Montalto to Bova railway\nstation is by no means to be recommended to young boys or persons in\ndelicate health. Allowing for only forty-five minutes’ rest, it took me\nfourteen hours to walk to the town of Bova, and the railway station lies\nnearly three hours apart from that place. There is hardly a level yard\nof ground along the whole route, and though my “guide” twice took the\nwrong track and thereby probably lost me some little time, I question\nwhether the best walker, provided (as I was) with the best maps, will be\nable to traverse the distance in less than fifteen hours.",
        "Whoever he is, I wish him joy of his journey. Pleasant to recall,\nassuredly; the scenery and the mountain flowers are wondrously\nbeautiful; but I have fully realized what the men of Delianuova meant,\nwhen they said:",
        "“To Montalto, Yes; to Bova, No.”",
        "Musolino will remain a hero for many long years to come. “He did his\nduty “: such is the popular verdict on his career. He was not a brigand,\nbut an unfortunate–a martyr, a victim of the law. So he is described\nnot only by his country-people, but by the writers of many hundred\nserious pamphlets in every province of Italy.",
        "At any bookstall you may buy cheap illustrated tracts and poems setting\nforth his achievements. In Cosenza I saw a play of which he was the\nleading figure, depicted as a pale, long-suffering gentleman of the\n\"misunderstood\" type–friend of the fatherless, champion of widows and\norphans, rectifier of all wrongs; in fact, as the embodiment of those\nvirtues which we are apt to associate with Prometheus or the founder of\nChristianity.",
        "Only to those who know nothing of local conditions will it seem strange\nto say that Italian law is one of the factors that contribute to the\ndisintegration of family life throughout the country, and to the\nproduction of creatures like Musolino. There are few villages which do\nnot contain some notorious assassins who have escaped punishment under\nsentimental pleas, and now terrorize the neighbourhood. This is one of\nthe evils which derange patriarchalism; the decent-minded living in fear\nof their lives, the others with a conspicuous example before their eyes\nof the advantages of evil-doing. And another is that the innocent often\nsuffer, country-bred lads being locked up for months and years in prison\non the flimsiest pretexts–often on the mere word of some malevolent\nlocal policeman–among hardened habitual offenders. If they survive the\ntreatment, which is not always the case, they return home completely\ndemoralized and a source of infection to others.",
        "It is hardly surprising if, under such conditions, rich and poor alike\nare ready to hide a picturesque fugitive from justice. A sad state of\naffairs, but–as an unsavoury Italian proverb correctly says–il pesce\npuzza dal capo.",
        "For the fault lies not only in the fundamental perversity of all Roman\nLaw. It lies also in the local administration of that law, which is\ninefficient and marked by that elaborate brutality characteristic of all\n\"philosophic” and tender-hearted nations. One thinks of the Byzantines.\n. . . That justices should be well-salaried gentlemen, cognizant of\ntheir duties to society; that carbineers and other police-functionaries\nshould be civilly responsible for outrages upon the public; that a\nso-called “habeas-corpus” Act might be as useful here as among certain\nsavages of the north; that the Baghdad system of delays leads to\ncorruption of underpaid officials and witnesses alike (not to speak of\njudges)–in a word, that the method pursued hereabouts is calculated to\ncreate rather than to repress crime: these are truths of too elementary\na nature to find their way into the brains of the megalomaniac\nrhetoricians who control their country’s fate. They will never endorse\nthat saying of Stendhal’s: “In Italy, with the exception of Milan, the\ndeath-penalty is the preface of all civilization.” (To this day, the\nproportion of murders is still 13 per cent higher in Palermo than in\nMilan.)",
        "Speak to the wisest judges of the horrors of cellular confinement such\nas Musolino was enduring up to a short time ago, as opposed to capital\npunishment, and you will learn that they invoke the humanitarian\nBeccaria in justification of it. Theorists!",
        "For less formidable criminals there exists that wondrous institution of\ndomicilio coatto, which I have studied in the islands of Lipari and\nPonza. These evil-doers seldom try to escape; life is far too\ncomfortable, and the wine good and cheap; often, on completing their\nsentences, they get themselves condemned anew, in order to return. The\nhard-working man may well envy their lot, for they recuve free lodging\nfrom the Government, a daily allowance of money, and two new suits of\nclothes a year–they are not asked to do a stroke of work in return, but\nmay lie in bed all day long, if so disposed. The law-abiding citizen,\nmeanwhile, pays for the upkeep of this horde of malefactors, as well as\nfor the army of officials who are deputed to attend to their wants. This\ninstitution of domicilio coatto is one of those things which would be\nincredible, were it not actually in existence. It is a school, a\nState-fostered school, for the promotion of criminality.",
        "But what shall be expected? Where judges sob like children, and jurors\nswoon away with emotionalism; where floods of bombast–go to the courts,\nand listen!–take the place of cross-examination and duly-sworn\naffidavits; where perjury is a humanly venial and almost praiseworthy\nfailing–how shall the code, defective as it is, be administered?\nRhetoric, and rhetoric alone, sways the decision of the courts. Scholars\nare only now beginning to realize to what an extent the ancient sense of\nveracity was tainted with this vice–how deeply all classical history is\npermeated with elegant partisan non-truth. And this evil legacy from\nGreco-Roman days has been augmented by the more recent teachings of\nJesuitry and the Catholic theory of “peccato veniale.” Rhetoric alone\ncounts; rhetoric alone is “art.” The rest is mere facts; and your\n\"penalista” has a constitutional horror of a bald fact, because there\nit is, and there is nothing to be done with it. It is too crude a thing\nfor cultured men to handle. If a local barrister were forced to state in\ncourt a plain fact, without varnish, he would die of cerebral\ncongestion; the judge, of boredom.",
        "In early times, these provinces had a rough-and-ready cowboy justice\nwhich answered simple needs, and when, in Bourbon days, things became\nmore centralized, there was still a never-failing expedient: each judge\nhaving a fixed and publicly acknowledged tariff, the village elders, in\ndeserving cases, subscribed the requisite sum and released their\nprisoner. But Italy is now paying the penalty of ambition. With one foot\nin the ferocity of her past, and the other on a quicksand of\ndream-nurtured idealism, she contrives to combine the disadvantages of\nboth. She, who was the light o’ love of all Europe for long ages, and in\nher poverty denied nothing to her clientele, has now laid aside a little\nmoney, repenting of her frivolous and mercenary deeds (they sometimes\ndo), and becoming puritanically zealous of good works in her old\nage–all this, however, as might have been expected from her antecedent\ncareer, without much discrimination.",
        "It is certainly remarkable that a race of men who have been such ardent\nopponents of many forms of tyranny in the past, should still endure a\nsystem of criminal procedure worthy of Torquemada. High and low cry out\nagainst it, but–pazienza! Where shall grievances be ventilated? In\nParliament? A good joke, that! In the press? Better still! Italian\nnewspapers nowise reflect the opinions of civilized Italy; they are mere\ncheese-wrappers; in the whole kingdom there are only three\nself-respecting dailies. The people have learnt to despair of their\nrulers–to regard them with cynical suspicion. Public opinion has been\ncrushed out of the country. What goes by that name is the gossip of the\ntown-concierge, or obscure village cabals and schemings.",
        "I am quite aware that the law-abiding spirit is the slow growth of ages,\nand that a serious mischief like this cannot be repaired in a short\ngeneration. I know that even now the Italian code of criminal procedure,\nthat tragic farce, is under revision. I know, moreover, that there are\nstipendiary magistrates in south Italy whose discernment and integrity\nwould do honour to our British courts. But–take the case out of their\nhands into a higher tribunal, and you may put your trust in God, or in\nyour purse. Justice hereabouts is in the same condition as it was in\nEgypt at the time of Lord Dufferin’s report: a mockery.",
        "It may be said that it does not concern aliens to make such criticism. A\nfatuous observation! Everything concerns everybody. The foreigner in\nItaly, if he is wise, will familiarize himself not only with the\ncathedrals to be visited, but also, and primarily, with the technique of\nlegal bribery and subterfuge–with the methods locally employed for\nescaping out of the meshes of the law. Otherwise he may find unpleasant\nsurprises in store for him. Had Mr. Mercer made it his business to\nacquire some rudiments of this useful knowledge, he would never have\nundergone that outrageous official ill-treatment which has become a\nbyword in the annals of international amenities. And if these strictures\nbe considered too severe, let us see what Italians themselves have to\nsay. In 1900 was published a book called “La Quistione Meridionale\"\n(What’s Wrong with the South), that throws a flood of light upon local\nconditions. It contains the views of twenty-seven of the most prominent\nmen in the country as to how south Italian problems should be faced and\nsolved. Nearly all of them deplore the lack of justice. Says Professor\nColajanni: “To heal the south, we require an honest, intelligent and\nsagacious government, which we have not got.” And Lombroso: “In the\nsouth it is necessary to introduce justice, which does not exist, save\nin favour of certain classes.”",
        "I am tempted to linger on this subject, not without reason. These people\nand their attitude towards life will remain an enigma to the traveller,\nuntil he has acquainted himself with the law of the land and seen with\nhis own eyes something of the atrocious misery which its administration\ninvolves. A murderer like Musolino, crowned with an aureole of\nsaintliness, would be an anomaly in England. We should think it rather\nparadoxical to hear a respectable old farmer recommending his boys to\nshoot a policeman, whenever they safely can. On the spot, things begin\nto wear a different aspect. Musolino is no more to be blamed than a\nchild who has been systematically misguided by his parents; and if these\npeople, much as they love their homes and families, are all potential\nMusolinos, they have good reasons for it–excellent reasons.",
        "No south Italian living at this present moment, be he of what social\nclass you please–be he of the gentlest blood or most refined\nculture–is a priori on the side of the policeman. No; not a\npriori. The abuses of the executive are too terrific to warrant such an\nattitude. Has not the entire police force of Naples, up to its very\nhead, been lately proved to be in the pay of the camorra; to say nothing\nof its connection with what Messrs. King and Okey euphemistically call\n\"the unseen hand at Rome\"–a hand which is held out for blackmail, and\nnot vainly, from the highest ministerial benches? Under such conditions,\nthe populace becomes profoundly distrustful of the powers that be, and\nsuch distrust breeds bad citizens. But so things will remain, until the\nbag-and-baggage policy is applied to the whole code of criminal\nprocedure, and to a good half of its present administrators.",
        "The best of law-systems, no doubt, is but a compromise. Science being\none thing, and public order another, the most enlightened of legislators\nmay well tremble to engraft the fruits of modern psychological research\nupon the tree of law, lest the scion prove too vigorous for the aged\nvegetable. But some compromises are better than others; and the Italian\ncode, which reads like a fairy tale and works like a Fury, is as bad a\none as human ingenuity can devise. If a prisoner escape punishment, it\nis due not so much to his innocence as to some access of sanity or\nbenevolence on the part of the judge, who courageously twists the law in\nhis favour. Fortunately, such humane exponents of the code are common\nenough; were it otherwise, the prisons, extensive as they are, would\nhave to be considerably enlarged. But that ideal judge who shall be paid\nas befits his grave calling, who shall combine the honesty and common\nsense of the north with the analytical acumen of the south, has yet to\nbe evolved. What interests the student of history is that things\nhereabouts have not changed by a hair since the days of Demosthenes and\nthose preposterous old Hellenic tribunals. Not by a single hair! On the\none hand, we have a deluge of subtle disquisitions on “jurisprudence,\"\n\"personal responsibility” and so forth; on the other, the sinister\ntomfoolery known as law– that is, babble, corruption, palaeolithic\nideas of what constitutes evidence, and a court-procedure that reminds\none of Gilbert and Sullivan at their best.",
        "There was a report in the papers not long ago of the trial of an old\nmarried couple, on the charge of murdering a young girl. The bench\ndismissed the case, remarking that there was not a particle of evidence\nagainst them; they had plainly been exemplary citizens all their long\nlives. They had spent five years in prison awaiting trial. Five years,\nand innocent! It stands to reason that such abuses disorganize the\nfamily, especially in Italy, where the “family” means much more than it\ndoes in England; the land lies barren, and savings are wasted in paying\nlawyers and bribing greedy court officials. What are this worthy couple\nto think of Avanti, Savoia! once they have issued from their dungeon?",
        "I read, in yesterday’s Parliamentary Proceedings, of an honourable\nmember (Aprile) rising to ask the Minister of Justice (Gallini) whether\nthe time has not come to proceed with the trial of “Signori Camerano and\ntheir co-accused,” who have been in prison for six years, charged with\nvoluntary homicide. Whereto His Excellency sagely replies that “la\nmagistratura ha avuto i suoi motivi\"–the magistrates have had their\nreasons. Six years in confinement, and perhaps innocent! Can one wonder,\nunder such circumstances, at the anarchist schools of Prato and\nelsewhere? Can one wonder if even a vindictive and corrupt rag like the\nsocialistic “Avanti” occasionally prints frantic protests of\nquasi-righteous indignation? And not a hundredth part of such accused\npersons can cause a Minister of the Crown to be interpellated on their\nbehalf. The others suffer silently and often die, forgotten, in their\ncells.",
        "And yet–how seriously we take this nation! Almost as seriously as we\ntake ourselves. The reason is that most of us come to Italy too\nundiscerning, too reverent; in the pre-critical and pre-humorous stages.\nWe arrive here, stuffed with Renaissance ideals or classical lore, and\nviewing the present through coloured spectacles. We arrive here, above\nall things, too young; for youth loves to lean on tradition and to draw\ninspiration from what has gone before; youth finds nothing more\ndifficult than to follow Goethe’s advice about grasping that living life\nwhich shifts and fluctuates about us. Few writers are sufficiently\ndetached to laugh at these people as they, together with ourselves, so\noften and so richly deserve. I spoke of the buffoonery of Italian law; I\nmight have called it a burlesque. The trial of the ex-minister Nasi:\nhere was a cause celebre conducted by the highest tribunal of the\nland; and if it was not a burlesque–why, we must coin a new word for\nwhat is.",
        "A black snake of alarming dimensions, one of the monsters that still\ninfest the Calabrian lowlands, glided across the roadway while I was\nwaiting for the post carriage to drive me to Caulonia from its\nrailway-station. Auspicious omen! It carried my thoughts from old\nAesculapius to his modern representatives–to that school of wise and\ndisinterested healers who are ridding these regions of their curse, and\nwith whom I was soon to have some nearer acquaintance. We started at\nlast, in the hot hours of the morning, and the road at first skirts the\nbanks of the Alaro, the Sagra of old, on whose banks was fought the\nfabled battle between the men of Croton and Locri. Then it begins to\nclimb upwards. My companion was a poor peasant woman, nearly blind (from\nmalaria, possibly). Full of my impressions of yesterday, I promptly led\nthe conversation towards the subject of Musolino. She had never spoken\nto him, she said, or even seen him. But she got ten francs from him, all\nthe same. In dire distress, some years ago, she had asked a friend in\nthe mountains to approach the brigand on her behalf. The money was long\nin coming, she added, but of course it came in the end. He always helped\npoor people, even those outside his own country. The site of the\noriginal Caulonia is quite uncertain. Excavations now going on at\nMonasterace, some ten miles further on, may decide that the town lay\nthere. Some are in favour of the miserable village of Foca, near at\nhand; or of other sites. The name of Foca seems to point, rather, to a\nsettlement of the regenerator Nicephorus Phocas. Be that as it may, the\npresent town of Caulonia used to be called Castelvetere, and it\nappropriated the Greek name in accordance with a custom which has been\nlargely followed hereabouts. [Footnote: It is represented with two\ntowers in Peutinger’s Tables. But these, says an editor, should have\nbeen given to the neighbouring Scilatio, for Caulon was in ruins at the\ntime of Pliny, and is not even mentioned by Ptolemy. Servius makes\nanother mistake; he confuses the Calabrian Caulon with a locality of the\nsame name near Capua.] It contains some ten thousand inhabitants,\namiable, intelligent and distinguished by a philoxenia befitting the\ntraditions of men who sheltered Pythagoras in his hour of need. As at\nRossano, Catanzaro and many other Calabrian towns, there used to be a\nghetto of Jews here; the district is still called “La Giudeca\"; their\nsynagogue was duly changed into a church of the Madonna.",
        "So much I learn from Montorio, who further informs me that the\nubiquitous Saint Peter preached here on his way to Rome, and converted\nthe people to Christianity; and that the town can boast of three\nauthentic portraits of the Mother of God painted by Saint Luke (\"Lukas\nme pinxit”). One is rather bewildered by the number of these\nmasterpieces in Italy, until one realizes, as an old ecclesiastical\nwriter has pointed out, that “the Saint, being excellent in his art,\ncould make several of them in a few days, to correspond to the great\ndevotion of those early Christians, fervent in their love to the Great\nMother of God. Whence we may believe that to satisfy their ardent\ndesires he was continually applying himself to this task of so much\nglory to Mary and her blessed Son.” But the sacristan of the church at\nCaulonia, to whom I applied for information regarding these local\ntreasures, knew nothing about them, and his comments gave me the\nimpression that he has relapsed into a somewhat pagan way of regarding\nsuch matters.",
        "You may obtain a fairly good view of Caulonia from the southeast; or\nagain, from the neighbouring hillock of San Vito. The town lies some 300\nmetres above sea-level on a platform commanding the valleys of the Amusa\nand Alaro. This position, which was clearly chosen for its strategic\nvalue, unfortunately does not allow it to expand, and so the inhabitants\nare deprived of that public garden which they amply deserve. At the\nhighest point lies a celebrated old castle wherein, according to\ntradition, Campanella was imprisoned for a while. In the days of\nPacicchelli, it was a fine place–\"magnifico nelle regole di Fortezza,\ncon cinque baloardi provveduti di cannoni di bronzo, ed una riccha\nArmeria, degna habitazione di don Carlo Maria Carrafa, Prencipe della\nRoccella, che se ne intitola Marchese.” Mingled with the stones of its\nold walls they have recently found skeletons–victims, possibly, of the\nsame macabre superstition to which the blood-drenched masonry of the\nTower of London bears witness. Here, too, have been unearthed\nterra-cotta lamps and other antiquities. What are we to surmise from\nthis? That it was a Roman foundation? Or that the malaria in older times\nforced Caulonia to wander towards healthier inland heights after the\nexample of Sybaris-Terranova, and that the Romans continued to occupy\nthis same site? Or, assuming Castelvetere to date only from mediaeval\ntimes, that these ancient relics found their way into it accidentally?\nThe low-lying district of Foca, at this day, is certainly very\nmalarious, whereas the death-rate up here is only about 12 per 1000.",
        "Dr. Francesco Genovese of Caulonia, to whom I am indebted for much\nkindness and who is himself a distinguished worker in the humanitarian\nmission of combating malaria, has published, among other interesting\npamphlets, one which deals with this village of Foca, a small place of\nabout 200 inhabitants, surrounded by fertile orange and vine plantations\nnear the mouth of the Alaro. His researches into its vital statistics\nfor the half-century ending 1902 reveal an appalling state of affairs.\nBriefly summarized, they amount to this, that during this period there\nwere 391 births and 516 deaths. In other words, the village, which in\n1902 ought to have contained between 600 and 800 inhabitants, not only\nfailed to progress, but devoured its original population of 200; and not\nonly them, but also 125 fresh immigrants who had entered the region from\nthe healthy uplands, lured by the hope of gaining a little money during\nthe vintage season.",
        "A veritable Moloch!",
        "Had the old city of Caulonia, numbering perhaps 20,000 inhabitants,\nstood here under such conditions of hygiene, it would have been expunged\noff the face of the earth in fifty years.",
        "Yet–speaking of malaria in general–a good deal of evidence has been\nbrought together to show that the disease has been endemic in Magna\nGrsecia for two thousand years, and the customs of the Sybarites seem to\nprove that they had some acquaintance with marsh fever, and tried to\nguard against it. “Whoever would live long,” so ran their proverb, “must\nsee neither the rising nor the setting sun.” A queer piece of advice,\nintelligible only if the land was infested with malaria. Many of their\nluxurious habits assume another import, on this hypothesis. Like the\ninhabitants of the malarious Etruscan region, they were adepts at\ndraining, and their river is described, in one of the minor works\nattributed to Galen, as “rendering men infertile\"–a characteristic\nresult of malaria. What is still more significant is that their new town\nThurii, built on the heights, was soon infected, and though twice\nrepeopled, decayed away. And that they had chosen the heights for their\nrelative healthfulness we can infer from Strabo, who says that Paestum,\na colony from Sybaris, was removed further inland from the shore, on\naccount of the pestilential climate of the lowlands.",
        "But the Ionian shores cannot have been as deadly as they now are. We\ncalculate, for example, that the town walls of Croton measured eighteen\nkilometres in circumference, a figure which the modern visitor to\nCotrone only brings himself to believe when he remembers what can be\nactually proved of other Hellenic colonies, such as Syracuse. Well, the\npopulace of so large a city requires a surrounding district to supply it\nwith agricultural produce. The Marchesato, the vast tract bordering on\nCotrone, is now practically uninhabitable; the population (including the\ntown) has sunk to 45 to the square kilometre. That is malaria.",
        "Or rather, only one side of the evil. For these coastlands attract rural\nlabourers who descend from the mountains during the season of hay-making\nor fruit-harvest, and then return infected to their homes. One single\nmalarious patient may inoculate an entire village, hitherto immune,\ngranted the anophelines are there to propagate the mischief. By means of\nthese annual migrations the scourge has spread, in the past. And so it\nspreads to-day, whenever possible. Of forty labourers that left Caulonia\nfor Cotrone in 1908 all returned infected save two, who had made liberal\nuse of quinine as a prophylactic. Fortunately, there are no anophelines\nat Caulonia.",
        "Greatly, indeed, must this country have changed since olden days; and\ngleaning here and there among the ancients, Dr. Genovese has garnered\nsome interesting facts on this head. The coast-line, now unbroken sand,\nis called rocky, in several regions, by Strabo, Virgil and Persius\nFlaccus; of the two harbours, of Locri, of that of Metapontum, Caulonia\nand other cities, nothing remains; the promontory of Cocynthum\n(Stilo)–described as the longest promontory in Italy–together with\nother capes, has been washed away by the waves or submerged under silt\ncarried down from the hills; islands, like that of Calypso which is\ndescribed in Vincenzo Pascale’s book (1796), and mentioned by G.\nCastaidi (1842), have clean vanished from the map.",
        "The woodlands have retired far inland; yet here at Caulonia, says\nThucydides, was prepared the timber for the fleets of Athens. The\nrivers, irregular and spasmodic torrents, must have flowed with more\nequal and deeper current, since Pliny mentions five of them as\nnavigable; snow, very likely, covered the mountain tops; the rainfall\nwas clearly more abundant–one of the sights of Locri was its daily\nrainbow; the cicadas of the territory of Reggio are said to have been\n\"dumb,” on account of the dampness of the climate. They are anything but\ndumb nowadays.",
        "Earth-movements, too, have tilted the coast-line up and down, and there\nis evidence to show that while the Tyrrhenian shore has been raised by\nthese oscillations, the Ionian has sunk. Not long ago four columns were\nfound in the sea at Cotrone two hundred yards from the beach; old\nsailors remember another group of columns visible at low tide near\nCaulonia. It is quite possible that the Ionian used to be as rocky as\nthe other shore, and this gradual sinking of the coast must have\nretarded the rapid outflow of the rivers, as it has done in the plain of\nPaestum and in the Pontine marshes, favouring malarious conditions.\nEarthquakes have helped in the work; that of 1908 lowered certain parts\nof the Calabrian shore opposite Messina by about one metre. Indeed,\nthough earthquakes have been known to raise the soil and thereby improve\nit, the Calabrian ones have generally had a contrary effect. The\nterrific upheavals of 1783-1787 produced two hundred and fifteen lakes\nin the country; they were drained away in a style most creditable to the\nBourbons, but there followed an epidemic of malaria which carried off\n18,800 people!",
        "These Calabrian conditions are only part of a general change of climate\nwhich seems to have taken place all over Italy; a change to which\nColumella refers when, quoting Saserna, he says that formerly the vine\nand olive could not prosper “by reason of the severe winter” in certain\nplaces where they have since become abundant, “thanks to a milder\ntemperature.” We never hear of the frozen Tiber nowadays, and many\nremarks of the ancients as to the moist and cold climate seem strange to\nus. Pliny praises the chestnuts of Tarentum; I question whether the tree\ncould survive the hot climate of to-day. Nobody could induce “splendid\nbeeches” to grow in the lowlands of Latium, yet Theophrastus, a\nbotanist, says that they were drawn from this region for shipbuilding\npurposes. This gradual desiccation has probably gone on for long ages;\nso Signor Cavara has discovered old trunks of white fir in districts of\nthe Apennines where such a plant could not possibly grow to-day.",
        "A change to a dry and warm atmosphere is naturally propitious to\nmalaria, granted sufficient water remains to propagate the mosquito. And\nthe mosquito contents itself with very little–the merest teacup fui.",
        "Returning to old Calabria, we find the woods of Locri praised by\nProclus–woods that must have been of coniferous timber, since Virgil\nlauds their resinous pitch. Now the Aleppo pine produces pitch, and\nwould still flourish there, as it does in the lowlands between Taranto\nand Metaponto; the classical Sila pitch-trees, however, could not grow\nat this level any more. Corroborative evidence can be drawn from\nTheocritus, who mentions heath and arbutus as thriving in the marine\nthickets near Cotrone–mountain shrubs, nowadays, that have taken refuge\nin cooler uplands, together with the wood-pigeon which haunted the same\njungles. It is true that he hints at marshes near Cotrone, and, indeed,\nlarge tracts of south Italy are described as marshy by the ancients;\nthey may well have harboured the anopheles mosquito from time\nimmemorial, but it does not follow that they were malarious.",
        "Much of the healthy physical conditions may have remained into the\nMiddle Ages or even later; it is strange to read, for example, in\nEdrisius, of the pitch and tar that were exported to all parts from the\nBradano river, or of the torrential Sinno that “ships enter this\nriver–it offers excellent anchorage\"; odd, too, to hear of coral\nfisheries as late as the seventeenth century at Rocella Ionica, where\nthe waves now slumber on an even and sandy beach.",
        "But malaria had made insidious strides, meanwhile. Dr. Genovese thinks\nthat by the year 1691 the entire coast was malarious and abandoned like\nnow, though only within the last two centuries has man actively\nco-operated in its dissemination. So long as the woodlands on the plains\nare cut down or grazed by goats, relatively little damage is done; but\nit spells ruin to denude, in a country like this, the steep slopes of\ntheir timber. Whoever wishes to know what mischief the goats, those\npicturesque but pernicious quadrupeds, can do to a mountainous country,\nshould study the history of St. Helena. [Footnote: By J. C. Melliss\n(London, 1875).] Thanks to the goats, Maltese fever has lately been\nintroduced into Calabria. Man, with his charcoal-burning, has completed\nthe disaster. What happens? The friable rock, no longer sustained by\nplant-life, crashes down with each thunderstorm, blocks up the valleys,\ndevastating large tracts of fertile land; it creates swamps in the\nlowlands, and impedes the outflow of water to the sea. These ravenous\nfiumare have become a feature in Calabrian scenery; underneath one of\nthe most terrible of them lies the birthplace of Praxiteles. Dry or\nhalf-dry during the warm months, and of formidable breadth, such\ntorrent-beds–the stagnant water at their skirts–are ideal\nbreeding-places for the anophelines from their mouth up to a height of\n250 metres. So it comes about that, within recent times, rivers have\ngrown to be the main arteries of malaria. And there are rivers galore in\nCalabria. The patriotic Barrius enumerates no of them–Father Fiore,\nless learned, or more prudent, not quite so many. Deforestation and\nmalaria have gone hand in hand here, as in Greece, Asia Minor, North\nAfrica, and other countries.",
        "Thus year after year, from one cause or another, the conditions have\nbecome more favourable for the disease to do its fatal work.",
        "That much of this harm has been done quite lately can often be\nproved. At Caulonia, for instance, the woodlands are known to have\nreached the shore a hundred years ago, and there are bare tracts of land\nstill bearing the name of “foresta.” In a single summer (1807) a French\nregiment stationed at Cosenza lost 800 men from fever, and when Rath\nvisited the town in 1871 it was described to him as a “vast hospital\"\nduring the hot months; nevertheless, says he, the disease has only been\nso destructive during the last two centuries, for up to that time the\nforests touched the outskirts of the town and regulated the Crati-bed,\npreventing the formation of marshes. The literary record of Cosenza is\none of exceptional brilliance; for acute and original thought this town\ncan hardly be surpassed by any other of its size on earth. Were\nstatistics available, I have not the slightest doubt that fever could be\nshown to be largely responsible for the withering of its spiritual life.",
        "The same fate–the same relapse from prosperity to decay–and for the\nsame reasons, has overtaken many other riverside villages, among them\nthat of Tarsia, the Caprasia of the An tonine Itinerary. “It was\ndescribed to us,” says Rath, “as the most miserable and dirty village in\nCalabria; but we found it worse.” It remains, to-day, a highly infected\nand altogether pitiable place, concerning which I have made certain\nmodest researches that would require, none the less, a chapter to\nthemselves. . . .",
        "Perhaps I have already said over-much on the subject. An Englishman\nunacquainted with malaria might think so, oblivious of the fact that Sir\nRonald Ross has called it “perhaps the most important of human\ndiseases.” But let him go to a malarious country and see with his own\neyes something of the degradation it involves; how it stamps its\naccursed imprimatur upon man and nature alike! It is the blight of\nyouth–the desert-maker. A well-known Italian senator has declared that\nthe story of south Italy is, was, and will be the story of malaria; and\nthe greater part of Calabria will certainly remain an enigma to the\ntraveller who ignores what is meant by this plague.",
        "Malaria is the key to a correct understanding of the landscape; it\nexplains the inhabitants, their mode of life, their habits, their history.",
        "“How do you treat your malaria patients?” I once enquired of a doctor in\nIndia. A few good stiff doses, he said, when the attack is on; that\ngenerally settles them. If not, they can begin again. To take quinine as\na prophylactic, he considered folly. It might grow into a habit; you\nnever know. . . .",
        "It is to be hoped that such types are extinct, out there. They are\nextinct hereabouts. None but an ignorant person would now traverse\nmalarious tracts in summer without previous quininiza-tion; or, if\ninfected, deal with the disease otherwise than by an amply protracted\ntreatment of cure. Yet it is only quite lately that we have gained our\nknowledge of a proper use of the drug; and this accounts for the great\nmortality long after its specific effects had been recognized by the\nprofession. It was given both inefficiently and insufficiently. It was\nsold at a prohibitive price. The country people were distrustful;\nso-and-so had taken it for three or four days; he had improved, yes; but\nthe fever was on him once more. Why waste money on such experiments?",
        "I remember accosting a lad, anemic, shivering with the tertian, and\nmarked by that untimely senility which is the sign-manual of malaria. I\nsuggested quinine.",
        "“I don’t take doctors’ stuff,” he said. “Even if I wanted to, my father\nwould not let me. And if he did, there’s no money to pay for it. And if\nthere were, it would do no good. He’s tried it himself.”",
        "“Well, but how are you feeling?”",
        "“Oh, all right. There’s nothing much the matter with me. Just the bad air.”",
        "Such types, too, are practically extinct nowadays; the people are being\neducated to recognize their peril and how to avoid it; they begin to\nfollow Professor Celli’s advice in the matter of regarding quinine as\ntheir “daily bread.” For since the discovery of the anophelic origin of\nmalaria many devices have been put into execution to combat the disease,\nnot the least of them being a popularized teaching of its causes and\nconsequences by means of pamphlets, lectures to school-children, and so\nforth.",
        "Now, you may either fight the anopheles–the vehicle, or the disease\nitself. The first entails putting the country into such a state that the\nmosquito finds it unpleasant to live there, a labour of Hercules. Yet\nlarge sums are being expended in draining marshy tracts, regulating\nriver-beds and afforesting bare spaces; and if you are interested in\nsuch works, you will do well to see what is going on at Metaponto at\nthis moment. (A considerable portion of the Government grant for these\npurposes has lately been deflected for use in the Tripolitan war.)\nExemplary fines are also imposed for illicit timber-cutting and\ngrazing,–in those towns, at least, where the magistrate has sufficient\nsense to perceive the ulterior benefits to be derived from what\ncertainly entails a good deal of temporary hardship on poor people.\nCertain economic changes are helping in this work; so the wealth\nimported from America helps to break up the big properties, those\nlatifundia which, says an Italian authority, “are synonymous with\nmalaria.” The ideal condition–the extirpation of anophelines–will\nnever be attained; nor is it of vital importance that it should be.",
        "Far more pressing is the protection of man against their attacks.\nWonderful success has crowned the wire-netting of the windows–an\noutcome of the classical experiments of 1899, in the Roman Campagna.",
        "But chiefest and most urgent of all is the cure of the infected\npopulation. In this direction, results astonishing–results well-nigh\nincredible–have attended the recently introduced governmental sale of\nquinine. In the year 1895 there were 16,464 deaths from malaria\nthroughout Italy. By 1908 the number had sunk to 3463. Eloquent figures,\nthat require no comment! And, despite the fact that the drug is now sold\nat a merely nominal rate or freely given away to the needy–nay, thrust\ndown the very throats of the afflicted peasantry by devoted gentlemen\nwho scour the plains with ambulances during the deadly season–despite\nthis, the yearly profits from its sale are amounting to about\nthree-quarters of a million francs.",
        "So these forlorn regions are at last beginning to revive.",
        "And returning to Foca, of whose dreadful condition up to 1902 (year of\nthe introduction of Government quinine) I have just spoken, we find that\na revolution has taken place. Between that year and 1908 the birth-rate\nmore than doubled the death-rate. In 1908 some two hundred poor folks\nfrequented the ambulance, nearly six kilogrammes of quinine being\ngratuitously distributed; not one of the natives of the place was\nattacked by the disease; and there was a single death–an old woman of\neighty, who succumbed to senile decay. [Footnote: Doctor Genovese’s\nstatistical investigations have brought an interesting little fact to\nlight. In the debilitating pre-quinine period there was a surplus of\nfemale births; now, with increased healthfulness, those of the males\npreponderate.]",
        "This is an example of what the new quinine-policy has done for Italy, in\nbriefest space of time. Well may the nation be proud of the men who\nconceived this genial and beneficial measure and carried it through\nParliament, and of those local doctors without whose enlightened zeal\nsuch a triumph could not have been achieved. . . .",
        "Sir Ronald Ross’s discovery, by the way, has been fruitful not only in\npractical humanitarian results. For instance, it has reduced North’s\nlaborious “Roman Fever” to something little better than a curiosity. And\nhere, on these deserted shores that were once resplendent with a great\ncivilization–here is the place to peruse Mr. W. M. Jones’s studies on\nthis subject. I will not give even the shortest precis of his\nconscientious researches nor attempt to picture their effect upon a mind\ntrained in the old school of thought; suffice to say, that the author\nwould persuade us that malaria is implicated, to an hitherto unsuspected\nextent, in the decline of ancient Greece and Rome. And he succeeds. Yes;\na man accustomed to weigh evidence will admit, I think, that he has made\nout a suggestively strong case.",
        "How puzzled we were to explain why the brilliant life of Magna Graecia\nwas snuffed out suddenly, like a candle, without any appreciably\nefficient cause–how we listened to our preachers cackling about the\ninevitable consequences of Sybaritic luxury, and to the warnings of sage\npoliticians concerning the dangers of mere town-patriotism as opposed to\nworthier systems of confederation! How we drank it all in! And how it\nwarmed the cockles of our hearts to think that we were not vicious,\nnarrow-minded heathens, such as these!",
        "And now a vulgar gnat is declared to be at the bottom of the whole mystery.",
        "Crudely disconcerting, these scientific discoveries. Or is it not rather\nhard to be dragged to earth in this callous fashion, while soaring\nheavenward on the wings of our edifying reflections? For the rest–the\nold, old story; a simple, physical explanation of what used to be an\nenigma brimful of moral significance.",
        "That Mr. Jones’s facts and arguments will be found applicable to\nother decayed races in the old and new worlds is highly probable.\nMeanwhile, it takes one’s breath away quite sufficiently to realize that\nthey apply to Hellas and her old colonies on these shores.",
        "“’AUTOS. Strange! My interest waxes. Tell me then, what affliction, God\nor Devil, wiped away the fair life upon the globe, the beasts, the\nbirds, the delectable plantations, and all the blithe millions of the\nhuman race? What calamity fell upon them?’",
        "“’ESCHATA. A gnat.’",
        "“’AUTOS. A gnat?’",
        "“’ESCHATA. Even so.’”",
        "Thus I wrote, while yet unaware that such pests as anophelines existed\nupon earth. . . .",
        "At the same time, I think we must be cautious in following certain\ndeductions of our author; that theory of brutality, for example, as\nresulting from malaria. Speaking of Calabria, I would almost undertake\nto prove, from the archives of law-courts, that certain of the most\nmalarial tracts are precisely those in which there is least brutality of\nany kind. Cotrone, for instance. . . . The delegato (head of the\npolice) of that town is so young–a mere boy–that I marvelled how he\ncould possibly have obtained a position which is usually filled by\nseasoned and experienced officers. He was a “son of the white hen,” they\ntold me; that is, a socially favoured individual, who was given this job\nfor the simple reason that there was hardly any serious work for him to\ndo. Cosenza, on the other hand, has a very different reputation\nnowadays. And it is perfectly easy to explain how malaria might have\ncontributed to this end. For the disease–and herein lies its\ncurse–lowers both the physical and social standard of a people; it\nbreeds misery, poverty and ignorance–fit soil for callous rapacity.",
        "But how about his theory of “pessimism” infecting the outlook of\ngenerations of malaria-weakened sages? I find no trace of pessimism\nhere, not even in its mild Buddhistic form. The most salient mental\ntrait of cultured Calabrians is a subtle detachment and contempt of\nillusions–whence their time-honoured renown as abstract thinkers and\nspeculators. This derives from a philosophic view of life and entails,\nnaturally enough, the outward semblance of gravity–a Spanish gravity,\ndue not so much to a strong graft of Spanish blood and customs during\nthe viceregal period, as to actual affinities with the race of Spain.\nBut this gravity has nothing in common with pessimism, antagonistic\nthough it be to those outbursts of irresponsible optimism engendered\nunder northern skies by copious food, or beer.",
        "To reach the uplands of Fabbrizia and Serra, whither I was now bound, I\nmight have utilized the driving road from Gioioso, on the Reggio side of\nCaulonia. But that was everybody’s route. Or I might have gone via\nStilo, on the other side. But Stilo with its memories of Campanella–a\nSpanish type, this!–and of Otho II, its winding track into the\nbeech-clad heights of Ferdinandea, was already familiar to me. I elected\nto penetrate straight inland by the shortest way; a capable muleteer at\nonce presented himself.",
        "We passed through one single village, Ragona; leaving those of S. Nicola\nand Nardo di Pace on the right. The first of them is celebrated for its\nannual miracle of the burning olive, when, armed to the teeth (for some\nancient reason), the populace repairs to the walls of a certain convent\nout of which there grows an olive tree: at its foot is kindled a fire\nwhose flames are sufficient to scorch all the leaves, but behold! next\nday the foliage is seen to glow more bravely green than ever. Perhaps\nthe roots of the tree are near some cistern. These mountain villages,\nhidden under oaks and vines, with waters trickling through their lanes,\na fine climate and a soil that bears everything needful for life, must\nbe ideal habitations for simple folks. In some of them, the death-rate\nis as low as 7: 1000. Malaria is unknown here: they seem to fulfil all\nthe conditions of a terrestrial paradise.",
        "There is a note of joyous vigour in this landscape. The mule-track winds\nin and out among the heights, through flowery meadows grazed by cattle\nand full of buzzing insects and butterflies, and along hill-sides\ncunningly irrigated; it climbs up to heathery summits and down again\nthrough glades of chestnut and ilex with mossy trunks, whose shadow\nfosters strange sensations of chill and gloom. Then out again, into the\nsunshine of waving corn and poppies.",
        "For a short while we stumbled along a torrent-bed, and I grew rather sad\nto think that it might be the last I should see for some time to come,\nmy days in this country being now numbered. This one was narrow. But\nthere are others, interminable in length and breadth. Interminable! No\nbreeze stirs in those deep depressions through which the merest thread\nof milky water trickles disconsolately. The sun blazes overhead and\nhours pass, while you trudge through the fiery inferno; scintillations\nof heat rise from the stones and still you crawl onwards, breathless and\nfootsore, till eyes are dazed and senses reel. One may well say bad\nthings of these torrid deserts of pebbles which, up till lately, were\nthe only highways from the lowlands into the mountainous parts. But they\nare sweet in memory. One calls to mind the wild savours that hang in\nthe stagnant air; the cloven hill-sides, seamed with gorgeous patches of\nrusset and purple and green; the spectral tamarisks, and the glory of\ncoral-tinted oleanders rising in solitary tufts of beauty, or flaming\ncongregations, out of the pallid waste of boulders.",
        "After exactly six hours Fabbrizia was reached–a large place whose name,\nlike that of Borgia, Savelli, Carafa and other villages on these\nsouthern hills, calls up associations utterly non-Calabrian; Fabbrizia,\nwith pretentious new church and fantastically dirty side-streets. It\nlies at the respectable elevation of 900 metres, on the summit of a\nmonstrous landslide which has disfigured the country.",
        "While ascending along the flank of this deformity I was able to see how\nthe authorities have attempted to cope with the mischief and arrest\nfurther collapses. This is what they have done. The minute channels of\nwater, that might contribute to the disintegration of the soil by\nrunning into this gaping wound from the sides or above, have been\nartfully diverted from their natural courses; trees and shrubs are\nplanted at its outskirts in order to uphold the earth at these spots by\ntheir roots–they have been protected by barbed wire from the grazing of\ncattle; furthermore, a multitude of wickerwork dykes are thrown across\nthe accessible portions of the scar, to collect the downward-rushing\nmaterial and tempt winged plant-seeds to establish themselves on the\nledges thus formed. To bridle this runaway mountain is no mean task, for\nsuch frane are like rodent ulcers, ever enlarging at the edges. With\nthe heat, with every shower of rain, with every breath of wind, the\nearth crumbles away; there is an eternal trickling, day and night, until\nsome huge boulder is exposed which crashes down, loosening everything in\nits wild career; a single tempest may disrupture what the patience and\ningenuity of years have contrived.",
        "Three more hours or thereabouts will take you to Serra San Bruno along\nthe backbone of southern Italy, through cultivated lands and pasture and\nlonely stretches of bracken, once covered by woodlands.",
        "It may well be that the townlet has grown up around, or rather near, the\nfar-famed Carthusian monastery. I know nothing of its history save that\nit has the reputation of being one of the most bigoted places in\nCalabria–a fact of which the sagacious General Manhes availed himself\nwhen he devised his original and effective plan of chastising the\ninhabitants for a piece of atrocious conduct on their part. He caused\nall the local priests to be arrested and imprisoned; the churches were\nclosed, and the town placed under what might be called an interdict. The\nnatives took it quietly at first, but soon the terror of the situation\ndawned upon them. No religious marriages, no baptisms, no funerals–the\ncomforts of heaven refused to living and dead alike. . . . The strain\ngrew intolerable and, in a panic of remorse, the populace hunted down\ntheir own brigand-relations and handed them over to Manhes, who duly\nexecuted them, one and all. Then the interdict was taken off and the\npriests set at liberty; and a certain writer tells us that the people\nwere so charmed with the General’s humane and businesslike methods that\nthey forthwith christened him “Saint Manhes,” a name which, he avers,\nhas clung to him ever since.",
        "The monastery lies about a mile distant; near at hand is a little\nartificial lake and the renowned chapel of Santa Maria. There was a time\nwhen I would have dilated lovingly upon this structure–a time when I\nprobably knew as much about Carthusian convents as is needful for any of\ntheir inmates; when I studied Tromby’s ponderous work and God knows how\nmany more–ay, and spent two precious weeks of my life in deciphering\ncertain crabbed MSS. of Tutini in the Brancacciana library–ay, and\ntested the spleenful Perrey’s “Ragioni del Regio Fisco, etc.,” as to the\nalleged land-grabbing propensities of this order–ay, and even\npilgrimaged to Rome to consult the present general of the Carthusians\n(his predecessor, more likely) as to some administrative detail,\nall-important, which has wholly escaped my memory. Gone are those days\nof studious gropings into blind alleys! The current of zeal has slowed\ndown or turned aside, maybe, into other channels. They who wish, will\nfind a description of the pristine splendour of this monastery in\nvarious books by Pacicchelli; the catastrophe of 1783 was described by\nKeppel Craven and reported upon, with illustrations, by the Commission\nof the Naples Academy; and if you are of a romantic turn of mind, you\nwill find a good story of the place, as it looked duringthe ruinous days\nof desolation, in Misasi’s “Calabrian Tales.”",
        "It is now rebuilt on modern lines and not much of the original structure\nremains upright. I wandered about the precincts in the company of two\nwhite-robed French monks, endeavouring to reconstruct not the convent as\nit was in its younger days, but them. That older one, especially–he\nhad known the world. . . .",
        "Meat being forbidden, the godly brethren have a contract for fish to be\nbrought up every day by the post-carriage from the distant Soverato. And\nwhat happens, I asked, when none are caught?",
        "“Eh bien, nous mangeons des macaroni!”",
        "Such a diet would never suit me. Let me retire to a monkery where\ncarnivorous leanings may be indulged. Methinks I could pray more\ncheerfully with the prospect of a rational dejeuner a la fourchette\nlooming ahead.",
        "At the back of the monastery lies a majestic forest of white\nfirs–nothing but firs; a unique region, so far as south and central\nItaly are concerned. I was there in the golden hour after sunset, and\nyet again in the twilight of dew-drenched morning; and it seemed to me\nthat in this temple not made by hands there dwelt an enchantment more\nelemental, and more holy, than in the cloistered aisles hard by. This\nassemblage of solemn trees has survived, thanks to rare conditions of\nsoil and climate. The land lies high; the ground is perennially moist\nand intersected by a horde of rills that join their waters to form the\nriver Ancinale; frequent showers descend from above. Serra San Bruno has\nan uncommonly heavy rainfall. It lies in a vale occupying the site of a\npleistocene lake, and the forest, now restricted to one side of the\nbasin, encircled it entirely in olden days. At its margin they have\nestablished a manufactory which converts the wood into paper–blissful\nsight for the utilitarian.",
        "Finding little else of interest in Serra, and hungering for the\nflesh-pots of Cotrone, I descended by the postal diligence to Soverato,\nnearly a day’s journey. Old Soverato is in ruins, but the new town seems\nto thrive in spite of being surrounded by deserts of malaria. While\nwaiting for supper and the train to Cotrone, I strolled along the\nbeach, and soon found myself sitting beside the bleached anatomy of\nsome stranded leviathan, and gazing at the mountains of Squillace that\nglowed in the soft lights of sunset. The shore was deserted save for\nmyself and a portly dogana-official who was playing with his little\nson–trying to amuse him by elephantine gambols on the sand, regardless\nof his uniform and manly dignity. Notwithstanding his rotundity, he was\nan active and resourceful parent, and enjoyed himself vastly; the boy\npretending, as polite children sometimes do, to enter into the fun of\nthe game.",
        "Two new hotels have recently sprung up at Cotrone. With laudable\npatriotism, they are called after its great local champions, athletic\nand spiritual, in ancient days–Hotel Milo and Hotel Pythagoras. As\nsuch, they might be expected to make a strong appeal to the muscles and\nbrains of their respective clients. I rather fancy that the chief\ncustomers of both are commercial travellers who have as little of the\none as of the other, and to whom these fine names are Greek.",
        "As for myself, I remain faithful to the “Concordia” which has twice\nalready sheltered me within its walls.",
        "The shade of George Gissing haunts these chambers and passages. It was\nin 1897 that he lodged here with that worthy trio: Gibbon, Lenormant and\nCassiodorus. The chapters devoted to Cotrone are the most lively and\ncharacteristic in his “Ionian Sea.” Strangely does the description of\nhis arrival in the town, and his reception in the “Concordia,” resemble\nthat in Bourget’s “Sensations.”",
        "The establishment has vastly improved since those days. The food is good\nand varied, the charges moderate; the place is spotlessly clean in every\npart–I could only wish that the hotels in some of our English country\ntowns were up to the standard of the “Concordia” in this respect. “One\ncannot live without cleanliness,” as the housemaid, assiduously\nscrubbing, remarked to me. It is also enlarged; the old dining-room,\nwhose guests are so humorously described by him, is now my favourite\nbedroom, while those wretched oil-lamps sputtering on the wall have been\nreplaced by a lavish use of electricity. One is hardly safe, however, in\npraising these inns over-much; they are so apt to change hands. So long\nas competition with the two others continues, the “Concordia” will\npresumably keep to its present level.",
        "Of freaks in the dining-room, I have so far only observed one whom\nGissing might have added to his collection. He is a director of some\nkind, and his method of devouring maccheroni I unreservedly admire–it\ndisplays that lack of all effort which distinguishes true art from\nfalse. He does not eat them with deliberate mastication; he does not\neven–like your ordinary amateur–drink them in separate gulps; but he\ncontrives, by some swiftly-adroit process of levitation, that the whole\nplateful shall rise in a noiseless and unbroken flood from the table to\nhis mouth, whence it glides down his gullet with the relentless ease of\na river pouring into a cavern. Altogether, a series of films depicting\nhim at work upon a meal would make the fortune of a picture-show\ncompany–in England. Not here, however; such types are too common to be\nremarked, the reason being that boys are seldom sent to boarding schools\nwhere stereotyped conventions of “good form” are held up for their\nimitation, but brought up at home by adoring mothers who care little for\nsuch externals or, if they do, have no great authority to enforce their\nviews. On entering the world, these eccentricities in manner are proudly\nclung to, as a sign of manly independence.",
        "Death has made hideous gaps in the short interval. The kindly\nVice-Consul at Catanzaro is no more; the mayor of Cotrone, whose permit\nenabled Gissing to visit that orchard by the riverside, has likewise\njoined the majority; the housemaid of the “Concordia,” the domestic serf\nwith dark and fiercely flashing eyes–dead! And dead is mine hostess,\n\"the stout, slatternly, sleepy woman, who seemed surprised at my demand\nfor food, but at length complied with it.”",
        "But the little waiter is alive and now married; and Doctor Sculco still\nresides in his aristocratic palazzo up that winding way in the old\ntown, with the escutcheon of a scorpion–portentous emblem for a\ndoctor–over its entrance. He is a little greyer, no doubt; but the same\ngenial and alert personage as in those days.",
        "I called on this gentleman, hoping to obtain from him some reminiscences\nof Gissing, whom he attended during a serious illness.",
        "“Yes,” he replied, to my enquiries, “I remember him quite well; the\nyoung English poet who was ill here. I prescribed for him. Yes–yes! He\nwore his hair long.”",
        "And that was all I could draw from him. I have noticed more than once\nthat Italian physicians have a stern conception of the Hippocratic oath:\nthe affairs of their patients, dead or alive, are a sacred trust in\nperpetuity.",
        "The town, furthermore, has undergone manifold improvements in those few\nyears. Trees are being planted by the roadsides; electric light is\neverywhere and, best of all, an excellent water-supply has been led down\nfrom the cool heights of the Sila, bringing cleanliness, health and\nprosperity in its train. And a stately cement-bridge is being built over\nthe Esaro, that “all but stagnant and wholly pestilential stream.” The\nEsaro glides pleasantly, says the chronicler Noia Molisi. Perhaps it\nreally glided, in his day.",
        "One might do worse than spend a quiet month or two at Cotrone in the\nspring, for the place grows upon one: it is so reposeful and orderly.\nBut not in winter. Gissing committed the common error of visiting south\nItaly at that season when, even if the weather will pass, the country\nand its inhabitants are not true to themselves. You must not come to\nthese parts in winter time.",
        "Nor yet in the autumn, for the surrounding district is highly malarious.\nThucydides already speaks of these coastlands as depopulated (relatively\nspeaking, I suppose), and under the Romans they recovered but little;\nthey have only begun to revive quite lately. [Footnote: Between\n1815–1843, and in this single province of Catanzaro, there was an\nactual decline in the population of thirty-six towns and villages.\nMalaria!] Yet this town must have looked well enough in the twelfth\ncentury, since it is described by Edrisius as “a very old city,\nprimitive and beautiful, prosperous and populated, in a smiling\nposition, with walls of defence and an ample port for anchorage.” I\nsuspect that the history of Cotrone will be found to bear out Professor\nCelli’s theory of the periodical recrudescences and abatements of\nmalaria. However that may be, the place used to be in a deplorable\nstate. Riedesel (1771) calls it “la ville la plus affreuse de l’Italie,\net peut-etre du monde entier\"; twenty years later, it is described as\n\"sehr ungesund ... so aermlich als moeglich\"; in 1808 it was “reduite a\nune population de trois mille habitants ronges par la misere, et les\nmaladies qu’occasionne la stagnation des eaux qui autrefois\nfertilisaient ces belles campagnes.” In 1828, says Vespoli, it contained\nonly 3932 souls.",
        "I rejoice to cite such figures. They show how vastly Cotrone, together\nwith the rest of Calabria, has improved since the Bourbons were ousted.\nThe sack of the town by their hero Cardinal Ruffo, described by Pepe and\nothers, must have left long traces. “Horrible was the carnage\nperpetrated by these ferocious bands. Neither age nor sex nor condition\nwas spared. . . . After two days of pillage accompanied by a multitude\nof excesses and cruelties, they erected, on the third day, a magnificent\naltar in the middle of a large square\"–and here the Cardinal, clothed\nin his sacred purple, praised the good deeds of the past two days and\nthen, raising his arms, displayed a crucifix, absolving his crew from\nthe faults committed during the ardour of the sack, and blessed them.",
        "I shall be sorry to leave these regions for the north, as leave them I\nmust, in shortest time. The bathing alone would tempt me to prolong my\nstay, were it possible. Whereas Taranto, despite its situation,\npossesses no convenient beach, there are here, on either side of the\ntown, leagues of shimmering sand lapped by tepid and caressing waves; it\nis a sunlit solitude; the land is your own, the sea your own, as far as\neye can reach. One may well become an amphibian, at Cotrone.",
        "The inhabitants of this town are well-mannered and devoid of the\n\"ineffable” air of the Tarentines. But they are not a handsome race.\nGissing says, a propos of the products of a local photographer, that it\nwas “a hideous exhibition; some of the visages attained an incredible\ndegree of vulgar ugliness.” That is quite true. Old authors praise the\nbeauty of the women of Cotrone, Bagnara, and other southern towns; for\nmy part, I have seldom found good-looking women in the coastlands of\nCalabria; the matrons, especially, seem to favour that ideal of the\nHottentot Venus which you may study in the Jardin des Plantes; they are\ndecidedly centripetal. Of the girls and boys one notices only those who\npossess a peculiar trait: the eyebrows pencilled in a dead straight\nline, which gives them an almost hieratic aspect. I cannot guess from\nwhat race is derived this marked feature which fades away with age as\nthe brows wax thicker and irregular in contour. We may call it Hellenic\non the old-fashioned principle that everything attractive comes from the\nGreeks, while its opposite is ascribed to those unfortunate “Arabs” who,\nas a matter of fact, are a sufficiently fine-looking breed.",
        "And there must be very little Greek blood left here. The town–among\nmany similar vicissitudes–was peopled largely by Bruttians, after\nHannibal had established himself here. In the Viceregal period, again,\nthere was a great infusion of Spanish elements. A number of Spanish\nsurnames still linger on the spot.",
        "And what of Gissing’s other friend, the amiable guardian of the\ncemetery? “His simple good nature and intelligence greatly won upon me.\nI like to think of him as still quietly happy amid his garden walls,\ntending flowers that grow over the dead at Cotrone.”",
        "Dead, like those whose graves he tended; like Gissing himself. He\nexpired in February 1901–the year of the publication of the “Ionian\nSea,” and they showed me his tomb near the right side of the entrance;\na. poor little grave, with a wooden cross bearing a number, which will\nsoon be removed to make room for another one.",
        "This cemetery by the sea is a fair green spot, enclosed in a high wall\nand set with flowering plants and comely cypresses that look well\nagainst their background of barren clay-hills. Wandering here, I called\nto mind the decent cemetery of Lucera, and that of Manfredonia, built in\na sleepy hollow at the back of the town which the monks in olden days\nhad utilized as their kitchen garden (it is one of the few localities\nwhere deep soil can be found on that thirsty limestone plain); I\nremembered the Venosa burial-ground near the site of the Roman\namphitheatre, among the tombs of which I had vainly endeavoured to find\nproofs that the name of Horace is as common here as that of Manfred in\nthose other two towns; the Taranto cemetery, beyond the railway quarter,\nsomewhat overloaded with pretentious ornaments; I thought of many cities\nof the dead, in places recently explored–that of Rossano, ill-kept\nwithin, but splendidly situated on a projecting spur that dominates the\nIonian; of Caulonia, secluded among ravines at the back of the\ntown. . . .",
        "They are all full of character; a note in the landscape, with their\ncypresses darkly towering amid the pale and lowly olives; one would\nthink the populace had thrown its whole poetic feeling into the choice\nof these sites and their embellishments. But this is not the case; they\nare chosen merely for convenience–not too far from habitations, and yet\non ground that is comparatively cheap. Nor are they truly venerable,\nlike ours. They date, for the most part, from the timewhen the\nGovernment abolished the oldsystem of inhumation in churches–a system\nwhich, for the rest, still survives; there are over six hundred of these\nfosse carnarie in use at this moment, most of them in churches.",
        "And a sad thought obtrudes itself in these oases of peace and verdure.\nThe Italian law requires that the body shall be buried within\ntwenty-four hours after decease (the French consider forty-eight hours\ntoo short a term, and are thinking of modifying their regulations in\nthis respect): a doctor’s certificate of death is necessary but often\nimpossible to procure, since some five hundred Italian communities\npossess no medical man whatever. Add to this, the superstitions of\nignorant country people towards the dead, testified to by extraordinary\nbeliefs and customs which you will find in Pitre and other collectors of\nnative lore–their mingled fear and hatred of a corpse, which prompts\nthem to thrust it underground at the earliest possible opportunity.\n. . . Premature burial must be all too frequent here. I will not\nenlarge upon the theme of horror by relating what gravediggers\nhave seen with their own eyes on disturbing old coffins; if only half\nwhat they tell me is true, it reveals a state of affairs not to be\ncontemplated without shuddering pity, and one that calls for prompt\nlegislation. Only last year a frightful case came to light in Sicily.\nVideant Consules.",
        "Here, at the cemetery, the driving road abruptly ends; thenceforward\nthere is merely a track along the sea that leads, ultimately, to Capo\nNau, where stands a solitary column, last relic of the great temple of\nHera. I sometimes follow it as far as certain wells that are sunk,\nArab-fashion, into the sand, and dedicated to Saint Anne. Goats and cows\nrecline here after their meagre repast of scorched grasses, and the\nshepherds in charge have voices so soft, and manners so gentle, as to\ncall up suggestions of the Golden Age. These pastoral folk are the\nprimitives of Cotrone. From father to son, for untold ages before\nTheocritus hymned them, they have kept up their peculiar habits and\ntraditions; between them and the agricultural classes is a gulf as deep\nas between these and the citizens. Conversing with them, one marvels how\nthe same occupation can produce creatures so unlike as these and the\ngoat-boys of Naples, the most desperate camorristi.",
        "The cows may well be descendants of the sacred cattle of Hera that\nbrowsed under the pines which are known to have clothed the bleak\npromontory. You may encounter them every day, wandering on the way to\nthe town which they supply with milk; to avoid the dusty road, they\nmarch sedately through the soft wet sand at the water’s edge, their\nsilvery bodies outlined against a cserulean flood of sky and sea.",
        "On this promenade I yesterday observed, slow-pacing beside the waves, a\nmeditative priest, who gave me some details regarding the ruined church\nof which Gissing speaks. It lies in the direction of the cemetery,\noutside the town; “its lonely position,” he says, “made it interesting,\nand the cupola of coloured tiles (like that of the cathedral of Amalfi)\nremained intact, a bright spot against the grey hills behind.” This\ncupola has recently been removed, but part of the old walls serve as\nfoundation for a new sanctuary, a sordid-looking structure with\nred-tiled roof: I am glad to have taken a view of it, some years ago,\nere its transformation. Its patroness is the Madonna del Carmine–the\nsame whose church in Naples is frequented by thieves and cut-throats,\nwho make a special cult of this Virgin Motherand invoke Her blessing on\ntheir nefarious undertakings.",
        "The old church, he told me, was built in the middle of the seventeenth\ncentury; this new one, he agreed, might have been constructed on more\nambitious lines, “but nowadays-----” and he broke off, with eloquent\naposiopesis.",
        "It was the same, he went on, with the road to the cemetery; why should\nit not be continued right up to the cape of the Column as in olden days,\nover ground dove ogni passo e una memoria: where every footstep is a\nmemory?",
        "“Rich Italians,” he said, “sometimes give away money to benefit the\npublic. But the very rich–never! And at Cotrone, you must remember,\nevery one belongs to the latter class.”",
        "We spoke of the Sila, which he had occasionally visited.",
        "“What?” he asked incredulously, “you have crossed the whole of that\ncountry, where there is nothing to eat–nothing in the purest and most\nliteral sense of that word? My dear sir! You must feel like Hannibal,\nafter his passage of the Alps.”",
        "Those barren clay-hills on our right of which Gissing speaks (they are\nlike the baize of the Apennines) annoyed him considerably; they were\nthe malediction of the town, he declared. At the same time, they\nsupplied him with the groundwork of a theory for which there is a good\ndeal to be said. The old Greek city, he conjectured, must have been\nlargely built of bricks made from their clay, which is once more being\nutilized for this purpose. How else account for its utter disappearance?\nMuch of the finer buildings were doubtless of stone, and these have been\nworked into the fort, the harbour and palazzi of new Cotrone; but this\nwould never account for the vanishing of a town nearly twelve miles in\ncircumference. Bricks, he said, would explain the mystery; they had\ncrumbled into dust ere yet the Romans rebuilt, with old Greek stones,\nthe city on the promontory now occupied by the new settlement.",
        "The modern palaces on the rising ground of the citadel are worthy of a\nvisit; they are inhabited by some half-dozen “millionaires” who have\ngiven Cotrone the reputation of being the richest town of its size in\nItaly. So far as I can judge, the histories of some of these wealthy\nfamilies would be curious reading.",
        "“Gentlemen,” said the Shepherd, “if you have designs of Trading, you\nmust go another way; but if you’re of the admired sort of Men, that have\nthe thriving qualifications of Lying and Cheating, you’re in the direct\nPath to Business; for in this City no Learning flourisheth; Eloquence\nfinds no room here; nor can Temperance, Good Manners, or any Vertue meet\nwith a Reward; assure yourselves of finding but two sorts of Men, and\nthose are the Cheated, and those that Cheat.”",
        "If gossip at Naples and elsewhere is to be trusted, old Petronius seems\nto have had a prophetic glimpse of the dessus du panier of modern\nCotrone.",
        "The sun has entered the Lion. But the temperature at Cotrone is not\nexcessive–five degrees lower than Taranto or Milan or London. One grows\nweary, none the less, of the deluge of implacable light that descends,\nday after day, from the aether. The glistering streets are all but\ndeserted after the early hours of the morning. A few busy folks move\nabout till midday on the pavements; and so do I–in the water. But the\nlong hours following luncheon are consecrated to meditation and repose.",
        "A bundle of Italian newspapers has preceded me hither; upon these I\nbrowse dispersedly, while awaiting the soft call to slumber. Here are\nsome provincial sheets–the “Movement” of Castro-villari–the “New\nRossano\"–the “Bruttian” of Corigliano, with strong literary flavour.\nAstonishing how decentralized Italy still is, how brimful of purely\nlocal patriotism: what conception have these men of Rome as their\ncapital? These articles often reflect a lively turmoil of ideas,\nwell-expressed. Who pays for such journalistic ventures? Typography is\ncheap, and contributors naturally content themselves with the ample\nremuneration of appearing in print before their fellow-citizens; a\nconsiderable number of copies are exported to America. Yet I question\nwhether the circulation of the “New Rossano,” a fortnightly in its sixth\nyear, can exceed five hundred copies.",
        "But these venial and vapid Neapolitan dailies are my pet aversion. We\nknow them, nous autres, with their odious personalities and playful\nblackmailing tactics; many “distinguished foreigners,” myself included,\ncould tell a tale anent that subject.

I read it conscientiously from beginning to end, admiring, in my\nphysical capacity, the throbbing passion that prompts such public\noutbursts of confidence and, from a literary point of view, their\nlapidary style, model of condensation, impossible to render in English\nand conditioned by the hard fact that every word costs two sous.

Why, to be sure, it is the identical\ndissertation, with a few changes by the office-boy, that has cropped up\nperiodically in these pages for the last half-century, or whenever the\nrailway was first projected.

        "Towards this sunset hour the unbroken dome of the sky often undergoes a\nbrief transformation. High-piled masses of cloud may then be seen\naccumulating over the Sila heights and gathering auxiliaries from every\nquarter; lightning is soon playing about the livid and murky\nvapours–you can hear the thunders muttering, up yonder, to some\ndrenching downpour. But on the plain the sun continues to shine in\nvacuously benevolent fashion; nothing is felt of the tempest save\nunquiet breaths of wind that raise dust-eddies from the country roads\nand lash the sea into a mock frenzy of crisp little waves. It is the\nmerest interlude. Soon the blue-black drifts have fled away from the\nmountains that stand out, clear and refreshed, in the twilight. The wind\nhas died down, the storm is over and Cotrone thirsts, as ever, for rain\nthat never comes. Yet they have a Madonna-picture here–a celebrated\nblack Madonna, painted by Saint Luke–who “always procures rain, when\nprayed to.”",
        "Once indeed the tail of a shower must have passed overhead, for there\nfell a few sad drops. I hurried abroad, together with some other\ncitizens, to observe the phenomenon. There was no doubt about the\nmatter; it was genuine rain; the drops lay, at respectable intervals, on\nthe white dust of the station turnpike. A boy, who happened to be\npassing in a cart, remarked that if the shower could have been collected\ninto a saucer or some other small receptacle, it might have sufficed to\nquench the thirst of a puppy-dog.",
        "I usually take a final dip in the sea, at this time of the evening.\nAfter that, it is advisable to absorb an ice or two–they are excellent,\nat Cotrone–and a glass of Strega liqueur, to ward off the effects of\nover-work. Next, a brief promenade through the clean, well-lighted\nstreets and now populous streets, or along the boulevard Margherita to\nview the rank and fashion taking the air by the murmuring waves, under\nthe cliff-like battlements of Charles the Fifth’s castle; and so to dinner.",
        "This meal marks the termination of my daily tasks; nothing serious is\nallowed to engage my attention, once that repast is ended; I call for a\nchair and sit down at one of the small marble-topped tables in the open\nstreet and watch the crowd as it floats around me, smoking a Neapolitan\ncigar and imbibing, alternately, ices and black coffee until, towards\nmidnight, a final bottle of vino di Ciro is uncorked–fit seal for the\nlabours of the day.",
        "One might say much in praise of Calabrian wine. The land is full of\npleasant surprises for the cenophilist, and one of these days I hope to\nembody my experiences in the publication of a wine-chart of the province\nwith descriptive text running alongside–the purchasers of which, if\nfew, will certainly be of the right kind. The good Dr. Barth–all praise\nto him!–has already done something of the kind for certain parts of\nItaly, but does not so much as mention Calabria. And yet here nearly\nevery village has its own type of wine and every self-respecting family\nits own peculiar method of preparation, little known though they be\noutside the place of production, on account of the octroi laws which\nstrangle internal trade and remove all stimulus to manufacture a good\narticle for export. This wine of Ciro, for instance, is purest nectar,\nand so is that which grows still nearer at hand in the classical vale of\nthe Neto and was praised, long ago, by old Pliny; and so are at least\ntwo dozen more. For even as Gregorovius says that the smallest Italian\ncommunity possesses its duly informed antiquarian, if you can but put\nyour hand upon him, so, I may be allowed to add, every little place\nhereabouts can boast of at least one individual who will give you good\nwine, provided–provided you go properly to work to find him.",
        "Now although, when young, the Calabrian Bacchus has a wild-eyed beaute\ndu diable which appeals to one’s expansive moods, he already begins to\ntotter, at seven years of age, in sour, decrepit eld. To pounce upon him\nat the psychological moment, to discover in whose cool and cobwebby\ncellar he is dreaming out his golden summer of manhood–that is what a\nforeigner can never, never hope to achieve, without competent local aid.",
        "To this end, I generally apply to the priests; not because they are the\ngreatest drunkards (far from it; they are mildly epicurean, or even\nabstemious) but by reason of their unrivalled knowledge of\npersonalities. They know exactly who has been able to keep his liquor of\nsuch and such a year, and who has been obliged to sell or partially\nadulterate it; they know, from the confessional of the wives, the why\nand wherefore of all such private family affairs and share, with the\nchemist, the gift of seeing furthest into the tangled web of home life.\nThey are “gialosi,” however, of these acquirements, and must be\napproached in the right spirit–a spirit of humility. But if you\ntactfully lead up to the subject by telling of the manifold hardships of\ntravel in foreign lands, the discomfort of life in hostelries, the food\nthat leaves so much to be desired and, above all, the coarse wine that\nis already beginning, you greatly fear, to injure your sensitive spleen\n(an important organ, in Calabria), inducing a hypochondriacal tendency\nto see all the beauties of this fair land in an odious and sombre\nlight–turning your day into night, as it were–it must be an odd\npriest, indeed, who is not compassionately moved to impart the desired\ninformation regarding the whereabouts of the best vino di famiglia at\nthat moment obtainable. After all, it costs him nothing to do a double\nfavour–one to yourself and another to the proprietor of the wine,\ndoubtless an old friend of his, who will be able to sell his stuff to a\nforeigner 20 per cent dearer than to a native.",
        "And failing the priests, I go to an elderly individual of that tribe of\nred-nosed connaisseurs, the coachmen, ever thirsty and mercenary souls,\nwho for a small consideration may be able to disclose not only this\nsecret, but others far more mysterious.",
        "As to your host at the inn–he raises not the least objection to\nyour importing alien liquor into his house. His own wine, he tells you,\nis last year’s vintage and somewhat harsh (slightly watered, he might\nadd)–and why not? The ordinary customers are gentlemen of commerce who\ndon’t care a fig what they eat and drink, so long as there is enough of\nit. No horrible suggestions are proffered concerning corkage; on the\ncontrary, he tests your wine, smacks his lips, and thanks you for\ncommunicating a valuable discovery. He thinks he will buy a bottle or\ntwo for the use of himself and a few particular friends. . . .",
        "Midnight has come and gone. The street is emptying; the footsteps of\npassengers begin to ring hollow. I arise, for my customary stroll in the\ndirection of the cemetery, to attune myself to repose by shaking off\nthose restlessly trivial images of humanity which might otherwise haunt\nmy slumbers.",
        "Town visions are soon left behind; it is very quiet here under the hot,\nstarlit heavens; nothing speaks of man save the lighthouse flashing in\nghostly activity–no, it is a fixed light–on the distant Cape of the\nColumn. And nothing breaks the stillness save the rhythmic breathing of\nthe waves, and a solitary cricket that has yet to finish his daily task\nof instrumental music, far away, in some warm crevice of the hills.",
        "A suave odour rises up from the narrow patch of olives, and figs loaded\nwith fruit, and ripening vines, that skirts the path by the beach. The\nfig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender\ngrape give a good smell.",
        "And so I plough my way through the sand, in the darkness, encompassed by\ntepid exhalations of earth and sea. Another spirit has fallen upon me–a\nspirit of biblical calm. Here, then, stood the rejoicing city that\ndwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside\nme: how is she become a desolation! It is indeed hard to realize that a\ntown thronged with citizens covered all this area. Yet so it is. Every\nfootstep is a memory. Along this very track walked the sumptuous ladies\nof Croton on their way to deposit their vain jewels before the goddess\nHera, at the bidding of Pythagoras. On this spot, maybe, stood that\npublic hall which was specially built for the delivery of his lectures.",
        "No doubt the townsfolk had been sunk in apathetic luxury; the time was\nripe for a Messiah.",
        "And lo! he appeared.",
        "The popularity of this sage at Croton offers no problem: the inhabitants\nhad become sufficiently civilized to appreciate the charm of being\nregenerated. We all do. Renunciation has always exercised an\nirresistible attraction for good society; it makes us feel so\ncomfortable, to be told we are going to hell–and Pythagoras was very\neloquent on the subject of Tartarus as a punishment. The Crotoniates\ndiscovered in repentance of sins a new and subtle form of pleasure;\nexactly as did the Florentines, when Savonarola appeared on the scene.",
        "Next: his doctrines found a ready soil in Magna Graecia which was\nalready impregnated with certain vague notions akin to those he\nintroduced. And then–he permitted and even encouraged the emotional sex\nto participate in the mysteries; the same tactics that later on\nmaterially helped the triumph of Christianity over the more exclusive\nand rational cult of Mithra. Lastly, he came with a “message,” like the\nApostle of the Gentiles; and in those times a preaching reformer was a\nnovelty. That added a zest. We know them a little better, nowadays.",
        "He enjoyed the specious and short-lived success that has attended,\nelsewhere, such efforts to cultivate the ego at the expense of its\nenvironment. “A type of aspiring humanity,” says Gissing, echoing the\nsentiments of many of us, “a sweet and noble figure, moving as a dim\nradiance through legendary Hellas.” I fancy that the mist of centuries\nof undiscriminating admiration has magnified this figure out of all\nproportion and contrived, furthermore, to fix an iridescent nimbus of\nsanctity about its head. Such things have been known to happen, in foggy\nweather.",
        "Was Greece so very legendary, in those times? Why, on the contrary, it\nwas full of real personages, of true sages to whom it seemed as if no\nsecrets of heaven or earth were past fathoming; far from being\nlegendary, the countryhad never attained a higher plane of intellectual\ncuriosity than when Pythagoras made his appearance. And it cannot be\ngainsaid that he and his disciples gave the impetus away from these wise\nand beneficial researches into the arid regions of metaphysics. It is so\nmuch more gentlemanly (and so much easier) to talk bland balderdash\nabout soul-migrations than to calculate an eclipse of the moon or bother\nabout the circulation of the blood.",
        "That a man of his speculative vigour, knowing so many extra-Hellenic\nraces, should have hit upon one or two good things adventitiously is\nonly to be expected. But they were mere by-products. One might as well\npraise John Knox for creating the commons of Scotland with a view to the\nfuture prosperity of that country–a consummation which his black\nfanaticism assuredly never foresaw.",
        "The chief practical doctrine of Pythagoras, that mankind are to be\ngoverned on the principle of a community of eastern monks, makes for the\ndisintegration of rational civic life.",
        "And his chief theoretical doctrines, of metempsychosis and the reduction\nof everything to a system of numbers [Footnote: Vincenzo Dorsa, an\nAlbanian, has written two pamphlets on the survival of Greco-Roman\ntraditions in Calabria. They are difficult to procure, but whoever is\nlucky enough to find them will be much helped in his understanding of\nthe common people. In one place, he speaks of the charm-formula of\nOtto-Nave! (Eight-Nine) It is considered meet and proper, in the\npresence of a suckling infant, to spit thrice and then call out, three\ntimes, Otto-Nove! This brings luck; and the practice, he thinks, is an\necho of the number-system of Pythagoras.]–these are sheer lunacy.",
        "Was it not something of a relapse, after the rigorous mental discipline\nof old, to have a man gravely assuring his fellows that he is the son of\nHermes and the divinely appointed messenger of Apollo; treating\ndiseases, like an Eskimo Angekok, by incantation; recording veracious\nincidents of his experiences during a previous life in Hell, which he\nseems to have explored almost as thoroughly as Swedenborg; dabbling in\nmagic, and consulting dreams, birds and the smoke of incense as oracles?\nAnd in the exotic conglomerate of his teachings are to be found the\nprima stamina of much that is worse: the theory of the pious fraud\nwhich has infected Latin countries to this day; the Jesuitical maxim of\nthe end justifying the means; the insanity of preferring deductions to\nfacts which has degraded philosophy up to the days of Kant; mysticism,\ndemon-worship and much else of pernicious mettle–they are all there,\nembryonically embedded in Pythagoras.",
        "We are told much of his charity; indeed, an English author has written a\nlearned work to prove that Pythagoreanism has close affinities with\nChristianity. Charity has now been tried on an ample scale, and has\nproved a dismal failure. To give, they say, is more blessed than to\nreceive. It is certainly far easier, for the most part, to give than to\nrefrain from giving. We are at last shaking off the form, of\nself-indulgence called charity; we realize that if mankind is to profit,\nsterner conceptions must prevail. The apotheosis of the god-favoured\nloafer is drawing to a close.",
        "For the rest, there was the inevitable admixture of quackery about our\nreforming sage; his warmest admirers cannot but admit that he savours\nsomewhat strongly of the holy impostor. Those charms and amulets, those\ndark gnomic aphorisms which constitute the stock-in-trade of all\nreligious cheap-jacks, the bribe of future life, the sacerdotal tinge\nwith its complement of mendacity, the secrecy of doctrine, the\npretentiously-mysterious self-retirement, the “sacred quaternion,” the\nbean-humbug . . .",
        "He had the true maraboutic note.",
        "And for me, this regenerator crowned with a saintly aureole remains a\nglorified marabout–an intellectual dissolvent; the importer of that\noriental introspectiveness which culminated in the idly-splendid\nyearnings of Plato, paved the way for the quaint Alexandrian\ntutti-frutti known as Christianity, and tainted the well-springs of\nhonest research for two thousand years. By their works ye shall known\nthem. It was the Pythagoreans who, not content with a just victory over\nthe Sybarites, annihilated their city amid anathemas worthy of those old\nChaldeans (past masters in the art of pious cursings); a crime against\ntheir common traditions and common interests; a piece of savagery which\nwrecked Hellenic civilization in Italy. It is ever thus, when the soul\nis appointed arbiter over reason. It is ever thus, when gentle,\ngod-fearing dreamers meddle with worldly affairs. Beware of the wrath of\nthe lamb!",
        "So rapidly did the virus act, that soon we find Plato declaring that all\nthe useful arts are degrading; that “so long as a man tries to study\nany sensible object, he can never be said to be learning anything\"; in\nother words, that the kind of person to whom one looks for common sense\nshould be excluded from the management of his most refined republic. It\nneeded courage of a rather droll kind to make such propositions in\nGreece, under the shadow of the Parthenon. And hand in hand with this\nfeudalism in philosophy there began that unhealthy preoccupation with\nthe morals of our fellow-creatures, that miasma of puritanism, which has\ninfected life and literature up to this moment.",
        "The Renaissance brought many fine things to England. But the wicked\nfairy was there with her gift: Pythagoras and Plato. We were not like\nthe Italians who, after the first rapture of discovery was over, soon\noutgrew these distracted dialectics; we stuck fast in them. Hence our\nPlatonic touch: our demi-vierge attitude in matters of the mind, our\nacademic horror of clean thinking. How Plato hated a fact! He could\nfind no place for it in his twilight world of abstractions. Was it not\nhe who wished to burn the works of Democritus of Abdera, most exact and\nreasonable of old sages?",
        "They are all alike, these humanitarian lovers of first causes. Always\nready to burn something, or somebody; always ready with their cheerful\nHell-fire and gnashing of teeth.",
        "Know thyself: to what depths of vain, egocentric brooding has that\ndictum led! But we are discarding, now, such a mischievously narrow view\nof the Cosmos, though our upbringing is still too rhetorical and\nmediaeval to appraise its authors at their true worth. Youth is prone to\njudge with the heart rather than the head; youth thrives on vaporous\nideas, and there was a time when I would have yielded to none in my\nenthusiasm for these mellifluous babblers; one had a blind, sentimental\nregard for their great names. It seems to me, now, that we take them\nsomewhat too seriously; that a healthy adult has nothing to learn from\ntheir teachings, save by way of warning example. Plato is food for\nadolescents. And a comfort, possibly, in old age, when the judicial\nfaculties of the mind are breaking up and primitive man, the visionary,\nreasserts his ancient rights. For questioning moods grow burdensome with\nyears; after a strain of virile doubt we are glad to acquiesce once\nmore–to relapse into Platonic animism, the logic of valetudinarians.\nThe dog to his vomit.",
        "And after Plato–the deluge. Neo-platonism. . . .",
        "Yet it was quite good sport, while it lasted. To “make men better” by\nchoice dissertations about Utopias, to sit in marble halls and have a\nfair and fondly ardent jeunesse doree reclining about your knees while\nyou discourse, in rounded periods, concerning the salvation of their\nsouls by means of transcendental Love–it would suit me well enough, at\nthis present moment; far better than croaking, forlorn as the\nnight-raven, among the ruins of their radiant lives.",
        "Meanwhile, and despite our Universities, new conceptions are prevailing,\nAristotle is winning the day. A fresh kind of thinker has arisen, whose\nchief idea of “virtue” is to investigate patiently the facts of life;\nmen of the type of Lister, any one of whom have done more to regenerate\nmankind, and to increase the sum of human happiness, than a wilderness\nof the amiably-hazy old doctrinaires who professed the same object. I\ncall to mind those physicians engaged in their malaria-campaign, and\nwonder what Plato would have thought of them. Would he have recognized the\nsignificance of their researches which, while allaying pain and misery,\nare furthering the prosperity of the country, causing waters to flow in\ndry places and villages to spring up in deserts–strengthening its\npolitical resources, improving its very appearance? Not likely. Plato’s\nopinion of doctors was on a par with the rest of his mentality. Yet\nthese are the men who are taking up the thread where it was dropped,\nperforce, by those veritable Greek sages, whelmed under turbid floods of\nPythagorean irrationalism. And are such things purely utilitarian? Are\nthey so grossly mundane? Is there really no “philosophy” in the choice\nof such a healing career, no romance in its studious self-denial, no\nbeauty in its results? If so, we must revise that classic adage which\nconnects vigour with beauty–not to speak of several others.",
        "Day after day, I look across the six miles of sea to the Lacinian\npromontory and its column. How reach it? The boatmen are eager for the\nvoyage: it all depends, they say, upon the wind.",
        "Day after day–a dead calm.",
        "“Two hours–three hours–four hours–according!” And they point to the\nsky. A little breeze, they add, sometimes makes itself felt in the early\nmornings; one might fix up a sail.",

        "“Three hours–four hours–five hours–according!”",
        "The prospect of rocking about for half a day in a small boat under a\nblazing sky is not my ideal of enjoyment, the novelty of such an\nexperience having worn off a good many years ago. I decide to wait; to\nmake an attack, meanwhile, upon old Petelia–the “Stromboli” of my\nlady-friend at the Catanzaro Museum....",
        "It is an easy day’s excursion from Cotrone to Strongoli, which is\nsupposed to lie on the site of that ancient, much-besieged town. It sits\nupon a hill-top, and the diligence which awaits the traveller at the\nlittle railway-station takes about two hours to reach the place,\nclimbing up the olive-covered slopes in ample loops and windings.",
        "Of Strangoli my memories, even at this short distance of time, are\nconfused and blurred. The drive up under the glowing beams of morning,\nthe great heat of the last few days, and two or three nights’\nsleeplessness at Cotrone had considerably blunted my appetite for new\nthings. I remember seeing some Roman marbles in the church, and being\nthence conducted into a castle.",
        "Afterwards I reposed awhile in the upper regions, under an olive, and\nlooked down towards the valley of the Neto, which flows not far from\nhere into the Ionian. I thought upon Theocritus, trying to picture this\nvale of Neaithos as it appeared to him and his shepherds. The woodlands\nare gone, and the rains of winter, streaming down the earthen slopes,\nhave remodelled the whole face of the country.",
        "Yet, be nature what it may, men will always turn to one who sings so\nmelodiously of eternal verities–of those human tasks and needs which no\nlapse of years can change. How modern he reads to us, who have been\nbrought into contact with the true spirit by men like Johnson-Cory and\nLefroy! And how unbelievably remote is that Bartolozzi-Hellenism which\nwent before! What, for example–what of the renowned pseudo-Theocritus,\nSalamon Gessner, who sang of this same vale of Neto in his “Daphnis”?\nAlas, the good Salamon has gone the way of all derivative bores; he is\ndead–deader than King Psammeticus; he is now moralizing in some\ndecorous Paradise amid flocks of Dresden-China sheep and sugar-watery\nyouths and maidens. Who can read his much-translated masterpiece without\nunpleasant twinges? Dead as a doornail!",
        "So far as I can recollect, there is an infinity of kissing in “Daphnis.\"\nIt was an age of sentimentality, and the Greek pastoral ideal,\ntransfused into a Swiss environment of 1810, could not but end in\nslobber and Gefuehlsduselei. True it is that shepherds have ample\nopportunities of sporting with Amaryllis in the shade; opportunities\nwhich, to my certain knowledge, they do not neglect. Theocritus knew it\nwell enough. But, in a general way, he is niggardly with the precious\ncommodity of kisses; he seems to have thought that in literature, if not\nin real life, one can have too much of a good thing. Also, being a\nsoutherner, he could not have trusted his young folks to remain\neternally at the kissing-stage, after the pattern of our fish-like\nEnglish lovers. Such behaviour would have struck him as improbable;\npossibly immoral. . . .",
        "From where I sat one may trace a road that winds upwards into the Sila,\npast Pallagorio. Along its sides are certain mounded heaps and the smoke\nof refining works. These are mines of that dusky sulphur which I had\nobserved being drawn in carts through the streets of Cotrone. There are\nsome eight or ten of them, they tell me, discovered about thirty years\nago–this is all wrong: they are mentioned in 1571–and employing\nseveral hundred workmen. It had been my intention to visit these\nexcavations. But now, in the heat of day, I wavered; the distance, even\nto the nearest of them, seemed inordinately great; and just as I had\ndecided to look for a carnage with a view of being driven there (that\ncurse of conscientiousness!) an amiable citizen snatched me up as his\nguest for luncheon. He led me, weakly resisting, to a vaulted chamber\nwhere, amid a repast of rural delicacies and the converse of his spouse,\nall such fond projects were straightway forgotten. Instead of\nsulphur-statistics, I learnt a little piece of local history.",
        "“You were speaking about the emptiness of our streets of Strangoli,” my\nhost said. “And yet, up to a short time ago, there was no emigration\nfrom this place. Then a change came about: I’ll tell you how it was.\nThere was a guardia di finanze here–a miserable octroi official. To\nkeep up the name of his family, he married an heiress; not for the sake\nof having progeny, but–well! He began buying up all the land round\nabout–slowly, systematically, cautiously–till, by dint of threats and\nintrigues, he absorbed nearly all the surrounding country. Inch by inch,\nhe ate it up; with his wife’s money. That was his idea of perpetuating\nhis memory. All the small proprietors were driven from their domains and\nfled to America to escape starvation; immense tracts of well-cultivated\nland are now almost desert. Look at the country! But some day he will\nget his reward; under the ribs, you know.”",
        "By this purposeful re-creation of those feudal conditions of olden,\ndays, this man has become the best-hated person in the district.",
        "Soon it was time to leave the friendly shelter and inspect in the\nglaring sunshine the remaining antiquities of Petelia. Never have I felt\nless inclined for such antiquarian exploits. How much better the hours\nwould have passed in some cool tavern! I went forth, none the less; and\nwas delighted to discover that there are practically no antiquities\nleft–nothing save a few walls standing near a now ruined convent, which\nis largely built of Roman stone-blocks and bricks. Up to a few years\nago, the municipality carried on excavations here and unearthed a few\nrelics which were promptly dispersed. Perhaps some of these are what one\nsees in the Catanzaro Museum. The paternal government, hearing of this\nenterprise, claimed the site and sat down upon it; the exposed remains\nwere once more covered up with soil.",
        "A goat-boy, a sad little fellow, sprang out of the earth as I dutifully\nwandered about here. He volunteered to show me not only Strongoli, but\nall Calabria; in fact, his heart’s desire was soon manifest: to escape\nfrom home and find his way to America under my passport and protection.\nHere was his chance–a foreigner (American) returning sooner or later to\nhis own country! He pressed the matter with naif forcefulness. Vainly I\ntold him that there were other lands on earth; that I was not going to\nAmerica. He shook his head and sagely remarked:",
        "“I have understood. You think my journey would cost too much. But you,\nalso, must understand. Once I get work there, I will repay you every\nfarthing.”",
        "As a consolation, I offered him some cigarettes. He accepted one;\npensive, unresigned.",
        "The goat-herds had no such cravings–in the days of Theocritus.",
        "“Two hours–three hours–four hours: according!”",
        "The boatmen are still eager for the voyage. It all depends, as before,\nupon the wind.",
        "And day   after day   the Ionian lies before us–immaculate, immutable.",
        "I determined to approach the column by land. A mule was discovered, and\nstarting from the “Concordia” rather late in the morning, reached the\ntemple-ruin in two hours to the minute. I might have been tempted to\nlinger by the way but for the intense sunshine and for the fact that the\nmuleteer was an exceptionally dull dog–a dusky youth of the taciturn\nand wooden-faced Spanish variety, whose anti-Hellenic profile irked me,\nin that landscape. The driving road ends at the cemetery. Thence onward\na pathway skirts the sea at the foot of the clay-hills; passes the\nsunken wells; climbs up and down steepish gradients and so attains the\nplateau at whose extremity stands the lighthouse, the column, and a few\nwhite bungalows–summer-residences of Cotrone citizens.",
        "A day of shimmering heat. . . .",
        "The ground is parched. Altogether, it is a poor and thinly peopled\nstretch of land between Cotrone and Capo Rizzuto. No wonder the wolves\nare famished. Nine days ago one of them actually ventured upon the road\nnear the cemetery, in daylight.",
        "Yet there is some plant-life, and I was pleased to see, emerging from\nthe bleak sand-dunes, the tufts of the well-known and conspicuous sea\nlily in full flower. Wishful to obtain a few blossoms, I asked the boy\nto descend from his mule, but he objected.",
        "“Non si toccano questi fiori,” he said. These flowers are not to be\ntouched.",
        "Their odour displeased him. Like the Arab, the uncultivated Italian is\ninsensitive to certain smells that revolt us; while he cannot endure, on\nthe other hand, the scent of some flowers. I have seen a man professing\nto feel faint at the odour of crushed geranium leaves. They are fiori\ndi morti, he says: planted (sometimes) in graveyards.",
        "The last remarkable antiquity found at this site, to my knowledge, is a\nstone vase, fished up some years ago out of the sea, into which it may\nhave fallen while being carried off by pious marauders for the purpose\nof figuring as font in some church (unless, indeed, the land has sunk at\nthis point, as there is some evidence to show). I saw it, shortly after\nits return to dry land, in a shed near the harbour of Cotrone; the\nTaranto museum has now claimed it. It is a basin of purple-veined\npavonazzetto marble. Originally a monolith, it now consists of two\nfragments; the third and smallest is still missing. This noble relic\nstands about 85 centimetres in height and measures some 215 centimetres\nin circumference; it was never completed, as can be seen by the rim,\nwhich is still partially in the rough. A similar vessel is figured, I\nbelieve, in Tischbein.",
        "The small villa-settlement on this promontory is deserted owing to lack\nof water, every drop of which has to be brought hither by sea from\nCotrone. One wonders why they have not thought of building a cistern to\ncatch the winter rains, if there are any; for a respectable stone crops\nup at this end of the peninsula.",
        "One often wonders at things. . . .",
        "The column has been underpinned and strengthened by a foundation of\ncement; rains of centuries had begun to threaten its base, and there was\nsome risk of a catastrophe. Near at hand are a few ancient walls of\nreticulated masonry in strangely leaning attitudes, peopled by black\ngoats; on the ground I picked up some chips of amphorse and vases, as\nwell as a fragment of the limb of a marble statue. The site of this\npillar, fronting the waves, is impressively forlorn. And it was rather\nthoughtful, after all, of the despoiling Bishop Lucifero to leave two of\nthe forty-eight columns standing upright on the spot, as a sample of the\nlocal Doric style. One has fallen to earth since his day. Nobody would\nhave complained at the time, if he had stolen all of them, instead of\nonly forty-six. I took a picture of the survivor; then wandered a little\napart, in the direction of the shore, and soon found myself in a\nsolitude of burning stones, a miniature Sahara.",
        "The temple has vanished, together with the sacred grove that once\nembowered it; the island of Calypso, where Swinburne took his ease (if\nsuch it was), has sunk into the purple realms of Glaucus; the corals and\nsea-beasts that writhed among its crevices are en-gulphed under mounds\nof submarine sand. There was life, once, at this promontory. Argosies\ntouched here, leaving priceless gifts; fountains flowed, and cornfields\nwaved in the genial sunshine. Doubtless there will be life again; earth\nand sea are only waiting for the enchanter’s wand.",
        "All now lies bare, swooning in summer stagnation.",
        "Calabria is not a land to traverse alone. It is too wistful and\nstricken; too deficient in those externals that conduce to comfort. Its\ncharms do not appeal to the eye of romance, and the man who would\nperambulate Magna Graecia as he does the Alps would soon regret his\nchoice. One needs something of that “human element” which delighted the\ngenteel photographer of Morano–comrades, in short; if only those sages,\nlike old Noia Molisi, who have fallen under the spell of its ancient\nglories. The joys of Calabria are not to be bought, like those of\nSwitzerland, for gold.",
        "Sir Giovati Battista di Noia Molisi, the last of his family and name,\nhaving no sons and being come to old age without further hope of\noffspring, has desired in the place of children to leave of himself an\neternal memory to mankind– to wit, this Chronicle of the most Ancient,\nMagnificent, and Faithful City of Cotrone. A worthier effort at\nself-perpetuation than that of Strangoli. . . .",
        "A sturgeon, he notes, was caught in 1593 by the Spanish Castellan of the\ntown. This nobleman, puzzling whom he could best honour with so rare a\ndainty, despatched it by means of a man on horseback to the Duke of\nNocera. The Duke was no less surprised than pleased; he thought mighty\nwell of the sturgeon and of the respectful consideration which prompted\nthe gift; and then, by another horseman, sent it to Noia Molisi’s own\nuncle, accompanied, we may conjecture, by some ceremonious compliment\nbefitting the occasion.",
        "A man of parts, therefore, our author’s uncle, to whom his Lordship of\nNocera sends table-delicacies by mounted messenger; and himself a mellow\ncomrade whom I am loath to leave; his pages are distinguished by a\npleasing absence of those saintly paraphernalia which hang like a fog\nathwart the fair sky of the south.",
        "Yet to him and to all of them I must bid good-bye, here and now. At this\nhour to-morrow I shall be far from Cotrone.",
        "Farewell to Capialbi, inspired bookworm! And to Lenormant.",
        "On a day like this, the scholar sailed at Bivona over a sea so unruffled\nthat the barque seemed to be suspended in air. The water’s surface, he\ntells us, is “unie comme une glace.” He sees the vitreous depths invaded\nby piercing sunbeams that light up its mysterious forests of algae, its\nrock-headlands and silvery stretches of sand; he peers down into these\n\"prairies pelagiennes” and beholds all their wondrous fauna–the\nurchins, the crabs, the floating fishes and translucent medusae\n\"semblables a des clochettes d’opale.” Then, realizing how this\n\"population pullulante des petits animaux marins” must have impressed\nthe observing ancients, he goes on to touch–ever so lightly!–upon\nthose old local arts of ornamentation whereby sea-beasts and molluscs\nand aquatic plants were reverently copied by master-hand, not from dead\nspecimens, but “pris sur le vif et observes au milieu des eaux\"; he\nexplains how an entire school grew up, which drew its inspiration from\nthe dainty ... apes and movements of these frail creatures. This is au\nmeilleur Lenormant. His was a full-blooded yet discriminating zest of\nknowledge. One wonders what more was fermenting in that restlessly\ncurious brain, when a miserable accident ended his short life, after 120\ndays of suffering.",
        "So Italy proved fatal to him, as Greece to his father. But one of his\nhappiest moments must have been spent on the sea at Bivona, on that\nclear summer day–a day such as this, when every nerve tingles with joy\nof life.",
        "Meanwhile it is good to rest here, immovable but alert, in the\nbreathless hush of noon. Showers of benevolent heat stream down upon\nthis desolation; not the faintest wisp of vapour floats upon the\nhorizon; not a sail, not a ripple, disquiets the waters. The silence can\nbe felt. Slumber is brooding over the things of earth:",
        "Asleep are the peaks of the hills, and the vales,",
        "The promontories, the clefts,",
        "And all the creatures that move upon the black earth. . . .",
        "Such torrid splendour, drenching a land of austerut simplicity,\ndecomposes the mind into corresponding states of primal contentment and\nresilience. There arises before our phantasy a new perspective of human\naffairs; a suggestion of well-being wherein the futile complexities and\ndisharmonies of our age shall have no place. To discard these wrappings,\nto claim kinship with some elemental and robust archetype, lover of\nearth and sun-----",
        "How fair they are, these moments of golden equipoise!",
        "Yes; it is good to be merged awhile into these harshly-vibrant\nsurroundings, into the meridian glow of all things. This noontide is the\n\"heavy” hour of the Greeks, when temples are untrodden by priest or\nworshipper. Controra they now call it–the ominous hour. Man and\nbeast are fettered in sleep, while spirits walk abroad, as at midnight.\nNon timebis a timore noctuno: a sagitta volante in aie: a negotio\nperambulante in tenebris: ab incursu et demonio meridiano. The midday\ndemon–that southern Haunter of calm blue spaces. . . .",
        "So may some enchantment of kindlier intent have crept over Phaedrus and\nhis friend, at converse in the noontide under the whispering plane-tree.\nAnd the genius dwelling about this old headland of the Column is candid\nand benign.",
        "This corner of Magna Graecia is a severely parsimonious manifestation of\nnature. Rocks and waters! But these rocks and waters are actualities;\nthe stuff whereof man is made. A landscape so luminous, so resolutely\nscornful of accessories, hints at brave and simple forms of expression;\nit brings us to the ground, where we belong; it medicines to the disease\nof introspection and stimulates a capacity which we are in danger of\nunlearning amid our morbid hyperborean gloom–the capacity for honest\ncontempt: contempt of that scarecrow of a theory which would have us\nneglect what is earthly, tangible. What is life well lived but a blithe\ndiscarding of primordial husks, of those comfortable intangibilities\nthat lurk about us, waiting for our weak moments?",
        "The sage, that perfect savage, will be the last to withdraw himself from\nthe influence of these radiant realities. He will strive to knit closer\nthe bond, and to devise a more durable and affectionate relationship\nbetween himself and them. Let him open his eyes. For a reasonable\nadjustment lies at his feet. From these brown stones that seam the\ntranquil Ionian, from this gracious solitude, he can carve out, and bear\naway into the cheerful din of cities, the rudiments of something clean\nand veracious and wholly terrestrial–some tonic philosophy that shall\nfoster sunny mischiefs and farewell regret.",
