        "And dost thou that hast received all from another’s hands,\nrepine and blame the Giver, if He takes anything from thee? Why,\nwho art thou, and to what end comest thou here? was it not He\nthat brought thee into the world; was it not He that made the\nLight manifest unto thee, that gave thee fellow-workers, and\nsenses, and the power to reason? And how brought He thee into\nthe world? Was it not as one born to die; as one bound to live\nout his earthly life in some small tabernacle of flesh; to\nbehold His administration, and for a little while to share with\nHim in the mighty march of this great Festival Procession? Now\ntherefore that thou hast beheld, while it was permitted thee, the\nSolemn Feast and Assembly, wilt thou not cheerfully depart, when\nHe summons thee forth, with adoration and thanksgiving for what\nthou hast seen and heard?—\"Nay, but I would fain have stayed\nlonger at the Festival.\"—Ah, so would the mystics fain have the\nrites prolonged; so perchance would the crowd at the Great Games\nfain behold more wrestlers still. But the Solemn Assembly is\nover! Come forth, depart with thanksgiving and modesty—give\nplace to others that must come into being even as thyself.",
