        "And so that drawing-room which had brought Swann and Odette together\nbecame an obstacle in the way of their meeting. She no longer said to him,\nas she had said in the early days of their love: “We shall meet, anyhow,\nto-morrow evening; there’s a supper-party at the Verdurins’,” but “We\nsha’n’t be able to meet to-morrow evening; there’s a supper-party at the\nVerdurins’.” Or else the Verdurins were taking her to the Opéra-Comique,\nto see Une Nuit de Cléopâtre, and Swann could read in her eyes that\nterror lest he should ask her not to go, which, but a little time before,\nhe could not have refrained from greeting with a kiss as it flitted across\nthe face of his mistress, but which now exasperated him. “Yet I’m not\nreally angry,” he assured himself, “when I see how she longs to run away\nand scratch from maggots in that dunghill of cacophony. I’m disappointed;\nnot for myself, but for her; disappointed to find that, after living for\nmore than six months in daily contact with myself, she has not been\ncapable of improving her mind even to the point of spontaneously\neradicating from it a taste for Victor Massé! More than that, to find that\nshe has not arrived at the stage of understanding that there are evenings\non which anyone with the least shade of refinement of feeling should be\nwilling to forego an amusement when she is asked to do so. She ought to\nhave the sense to say: ’I shall not go,’ if it were only from policy,\nsince it is by what she answers now that the quality of her soul will be\ndetermined once and for all.” And having persuaded himself that it was\nsolely, after all, in order that he might arrive at a favourable estimate\nof Odette’s spiritual worth that he wished her to stay at home with him\nthat evening instead of going to the Opéra-Comique, he adopted the same\nline of reasoning with her, with the same degree of insincerity as he had\nused with himself, or even with a degree more, for in her case he was\nyielding also to the desire to capture her by her own self-esteem.",
        "“I swear to you,” he told her, shortly before she was to leave for the\ntheatre, “that, in asking you not to go, I should hope, were I a selfish\nman, for nothing so much as that you should refuse, for I have a thousand\nother things to do this evening, and I shall feel that I have been tricked\nand trapped myself, and shall be thoroughly annoyed, if, after all, you\ntell me that you are not going. But my occupations, my pleasures are not\neverything; I must think of you also. A day may come when, seeing me\nirrevocably sundered from you, you will be entitled to reproach me with\nnot having warned you at the decisive hour in which I felt that I was\ngoing to pass judgment on you, one of those stern judgments which love\ncannot long resist. You see, your Nuit de Cléopâtre (what a title!) has\nno bearing on the point. What I must know is whether you are indeed one of\nthose creatures in the lowest grade of mentality and even of charm, one of\nthose contemptible creatures who are incapable of foregoing a pleasure.\nFor if you are such, how could anyone love you, for you are not even a\nperson, a definite, imperfect, but at least perceptible entity. You are a\nformless water that will trickle down any slope that it may come upon, a\nfish devoid of memory, incapable of thought, which all its life long in\nits aquarium will continue to dash itself, a hundred times a day, against\na wall of glass, always mistaking it for water. Do you realise that your\nanswer will have the effect–I do not say of making me cease from that\nmoment to love you, that goes without saying, but of making you less\nattractive to my eyes when I realise that you are not a person, that you\nare beneath everything in the world and have not the intelligence to raise\nyourself one inch higher? Obviously, I should have preferred to ask you,\nas though it had been a matter of little or no importance, to give up your\nNuit de Cléopâtre (since you compel me to sully my lips with so abject a\nname), in the hope that you would go to it none the less. But, since I had\nresolved to weigh you in the balance, to make so grave an issue depend\nupon your answer, I considered it more honourable to give you due\nwarning.”",
        "Meanwhile, Odette had shewn signs of increasing emotion and uncertainty.\nAlthough the meaning of his tirade was beyond her, she grasped that it was\nto be included among the scenes of reproach or supplication, scenes which\nher familiarity with the ways of men enabled her, without paying any heed\nto the words that were uttered, to conclude that men would not make unless\nthey were in love; that, from the moment when they were in love, it was\nsuperfluous to obey them, since they would only be more in love later on.\nAnd so, she would have heard Swann out with the utmost tranquillity had\nshe not noticed that it was growing late, and that if he went on speaking\nfor any length of time she would “never” as she told him with a fond\nsmile, obstinate but slightly abashed, “get there in time for the\nOverture.”",
        "On other occasions he had assured himself that the one thing which, more\nthan anything else, would make him cease to love her, would be her refusal\nto abandon the habit of lying. “Even from the point of view of coquetry,\npure and simple,” he had told her, “can’t you see how much of your\nattraction you throw away when you stoop to lying? By a frank\nadmission–how many faults you might redeem! Really, you are far less\nintelligent than I supposed!” In vain, however, did Swann expound to her\nthus all the reasons that she had for not lying; they might have succeeded\nin overthrowing any universal system of mendacity, but Odette had no such\nsystem; she contented herself, merely, whenever she wished Swann to remain\nin ignorance of anything that she had done, with not telling him of it. So\nthat a lie was, to her, something to be used only as a special expedient;\nand the one thing that could make her decide whether she should avail\nherself of a lie or not was a reason which, too, was of a special and\ncontingent order, namely the risk of Swann’s discovering that she had not\ntold him the truth.",
        "Physically, she was passing through an unfortunate phase; she was growing\nstouter, and the expressive, sorrowful charm, the surprised, wistful\nexpressions which she had formerly had, seemed to have vanished with her\nfirst youth, with the result that she became most precious to Swann at the\nvery moment when he found her distinctly less good-looking. He would gaze\nat her for hours on end, trying to recapture the charm which he had once\nseen in her and could not find again. And yet the knowledge that, within\nthis new and strange chrysalis, it was still Odette that lurked, still the\nsame volatile temperament, artful and evasive, was enough to keep Swann\nseeking, with as much passion as ever, to captivate her. Then he would\nlook at photographs of her, taken two years before, and would remember how\nexquisite she had been. And that would console him, a little, for all the\nsufferings that he voluntarily endured on her account.",
        "When the Verdurins took her off to Saint-Germain, or to Chatou, or to\nMeulan, as often as not, if the weather was fine, they would propose to\nremain there for the night, and not go home until next day. Mme.  Verdurin\nwould endeavour to set at rest the scruples of the pianist, whose aunt had\nremained in Paris: “She will be only too glad to be rid of you for a day.\nHow on earth could she be anxious, when she knows you’re with us? Anyhow,\nI’ll take you all under my wing; she can put the blame on me.”",
        "If this attempt failed, M. Verdurin would set off across country until he\ncame to a telegraph office or some other kind of messenger, after first\nfinding out which of the ’faithful’ had anyone whom they must warn. But\nOdette would thank him, and assure him that she had no message for anyone,\nfor she had told Swann, once and for all, that she could not possibly send\nmessages to him, before all those people, without compromising herself.\nSometimes she would be absent for several days on end, when the Verdurins\ntook her to see the tombs at Dreux, or to Compiègne, on the painter’s\nadvice, to watch the sun setting through the forest–after which they went\non to the Château of Pierrefonds.",
        "“To think that she could visit really historic buildings with me, who have\nspent ten years in the study of architecture, who am constantly bombarded,\nby people who really count, to take them over Beauvais or\nSaint-Loup-de-Naud, and refuse to take anyone but her; and instead of that\nshe trundles off with the lowest, the most brutally degraded of creatures,\nto go into ecstasies over the petrified excretions of Louis-Philippe and\nViollet-le-Duc!  One hardly needs much knowledge of art, I should say, to\ndo that; though, surely, even without any particularly refined sense of\nsmell, one would not deliberately choose to spend a holiday in the\nlatrines, so as to be within range of their fragrant exhalations.”",
        "But when she had set off for Dreux or Pierrefonds–alas, without allowing\nhim to appear there, as though by accident, at her side, for, as she said,\nthat would “create a dreadful impression,\"–he would plunge into the most\nintoxicating romance in the lover’s library, the railway timetable, from\nwhich he learned the ways of joining her there in the afternoon, in the\nevening, even in the morning. The ways? More than that, the authority, the\nright to join her. For, after all, the time-table, and the trains\nthemselves, were not meant for dogs. If the public were carefully\ninformed, by means of printed advertisements, that at eight o’clock in the\nmorning a train started for Pierrefonds which arrived there at ten, that\ncould only be because going to Pierrefonds was a lawful act, for which\npermission from Odette would be superfluous; an act, moreover, which might\nbe performed from a motive altogether different from the desire to see\nOdette, since persons who had never even heard of her performed it daily,\nand in such numbers as justified the labour and expense of stoking the\nengines.",
        "So it came to this; that she could not prevent him from going to\nPierrefonds if he chose to do so. Now that was precisely what he found\nthat he did choose to do, and would at that moment be doing were he, like\nthe travelling public, not acquainted with Odette. For a long time past he\nhad wanted to form a more definite impression of Viollet-le-Duc’s work as\na restorer. And the weather being what it was, he felt an overwhelming\ndesire to spend the day roaming in the forest of Compiègne.",
        "It was, indeed, a piece of bad luck that she had forbidden him access to\nthe one spot that tempted him to-day. To-day! Why, if he went down there,\nin defiance of her prohibition, he would be able to see her that very day!\nBut then, whereas, if she had met, at Pierrefonds, some one who did not\nmatter, she would have hailed him with obvious pleasure: “What, you here?\"\nand would have invited him to come and see her at the hotel where she was\nstaying with the Verdurins, if, on the other hand, it was himself, Swann,\nthat she encountered there, she would be annoyed, would complain that she\nwas being followed, would love him less in consequence, might even turn\naway in anger when she caught sight of him. “So, then, I am not to be\nallowed to go away for a day anywhere!” she would reproach him on her\nreturn, whereas in fact it was he himself who was not allowed to go.",
        "He had had the sudden idea, so as to contrive to visit Compiègne and\nPierrefonds without letting it be supposed that his object was to meet\nOdette, of securing an invitation from one of his friends, the Marquis de\nForestelle, who had a country house in that neighbourhood. This friend, to\nwhom Swann suggested the plan without disclosing its ulterior purpose, was\nbeside himself with joy; he did not conceal his astonishment at Swann’s\nconsenting at last, after fifteen years, to come down and visit his\nproperty, and since he did not (he told him) wish to stay there, promised\nto spend some days, at least, in taking him for walks and excursions in\nthe district.  Swann imagined himself down there already with M. de\nForestelle. Even before he saw Odette, even if he did not succeed in\nseeing her there, what a joy it would be to set foot on that soil where,\nnot knowing the exact spot in which, at any moment, she was to be found,\nhe would feel all around him the thrilling possibility of her suddenly\nappearing: in the courtyard of the Château, now beautiful in his eyes\nsince it was on her account that he had gone to visit it; in all the\nstreets of the town, which struck him as romantic; down every ride of the\nforest, roseate with the deep and tender glow of sunset;–innumerable and\nalternative hiding-places, to which would fly simultaneously for refuge,\nin the uncertain ubiquity of his hopes, his happy, vagabond and divided\nheart. “We mustn’t, on any account,” he would warn M. de Forestelle, “run\nacross Odette and the Verdurins. I have just heard that they are at\nPierrefonds, of all places, to-day. One has plenty of time to see them in\nParis; it would hardly be worth while coming down here if one couldn’t go\na yard without meeting them.” And his host would fail to understand why,\nonce they had reached the place, Swann would change his plans twenty times\nin an hour, inspect the dining-rooms of all the hotels in Compiègne\nwithout being able to make up his mind to settle down in any of them,\nalthough he had found no trace anywhere of the Verdurins, seeming to be in\nsearch of what he had claimed to be most anxious to avoid, and would in\nfact avoid, the moment he found it, for if he had come upon the little\n’group,’ he would have hastened away at once with studied indifference,\nsatisfied that he had seen Odette and she him, especially that she had\nseen him when he was not, apparently, thinking about her. But no; she\nwould guess at once that it was for her sake that he had come there. And\nwhen M. de Forestelle came to fetch him, and it was time to start, he\nexcused himself: “No, I’m afraid not; I can’t go to Pierrefonds to-day.\nYou see, Odette is there.” And Swann was happy in spite of everything in\nfeeling that if he, alone among mortals, had not the right to go to\nPierrefonds that day, it was because he was in fact, for Odette, some one\nwho differed from all other mortals, her lover; and because that\nrestriction which for him alone was set upon the universal right to travel\nfreely where one would, was but one of the many forms of that slavery,\nthat love which was so dear to him. Decidedly, it was better not to risk a\nquarrel with her, to be patient, to wait for her return. He spent his days\nin poring over a map of the forest of Compiègne, as though it had been\nthat of the ’Pays du Tendre’; he surrounded himself with photographs of\nthe Château of Pierrefonds. When the day dawned on which it was possible\nthat she might return, he opened the time-table again, calculated what\ntrain she must have taken, and, should she have postponed her departure,\nwhat trains were still left for her to take. He did not leave the house,\nfor fear of missing a telegram, he did not go to bed, in case, having\ncome by the last train, she decided to surprise him with a midnight visit.\nYes! The front-door bell rang. There seemed some delay in opening the\ndoor, he wanted to awaken the porter, he leaned out of the window to shout\nto Odette, if it was Odette, for in spite of the orders which he had gone\ndownstairs a dozen times to deliver in person, they were quite capable of\ntelling her that he was not at home. It was only a servant coming in. He\nnoticed the incessant rumble of passing carriages, to which he had never\nbefore paid any attention.  He could hear them, one after another, a long\nway off, coming nearer, passing his door without stopping, and bearing\naway into the distance a message which was not for him. He waited all\nnight, to no purpose, for the Verdurins had returned unexpectedly, and\nOdette had been in Paris since midday; it had not occurred to her to tell\nhim; not knowing what to do with herself she had spent the evening alone\nat a theatre, had long since gone home to bed, and was peacefully asleep.",
        "As a matter of fact, she had never given him a thought. And such moments\nas these, in which she forgot Swann’s very existence, were of more value\nto Odette, did more to attach him to her, than all her infidelities.  For\nin this way Swann was kept in that state of painful agitation which had\nonce before been effective in making his interest blossom into love, on\nthe night when he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins’ and had\nhunted for her all evening. And he did not have (as I had, afterwards, at\nCombray in my childhood) happy days in which to forget the sufferings that\nwould return with the night. For his days, Swann must pass them without\nOdette; and as he told himself, now and then, to allow so pretty a woman\nto go out by herself in Paris was just as rash as to leave a case filled\nwith jewels in the middle of the street. In this mood he would scowl\nfuriously at the passers-by, as though they were so many pickpockets.  But\ntheir faces–a collective and formless mass–escaped the grasp of his\nimagination, and so failed to feed the flame of his jealousy. The effort\nexhausted Swann’s brain, until, passing his hand over his eyes, he cried\nout: “Heaven help me!” as people, after lashing themselves into an\nintellectual frenzy in their endeavours to master the problem of the\nreality of the external world, or that of the immortality of the soul,\nafford relief to their weary brains by an unreasoning act of faith. But\nthe thought of his absent mistress was incessantly, indissolubly blended\nwith all the simplest actions of Swann’s daily life–when he took his\nmeals, opened his letters, went for a walk or to bed–by the fact of his\nregret at having to perform those actions without her; like those initials\nof Philibert the Fair which, in the church of Brou, because of her grief,\nher longing for him, Margaret of Austria intertwined everywhere with her\nown. On some days, instead of staying at home, he would go for luncheon to\na restaurant not far off, to which he had been attracted, some time\nbefore, by the excellence of its cookery, but to which he now went only\nfor one of those reasons, at once mystical and absurd, which people call\n’romantic’; because this restaurant (which, by the way, still exists) bore\nthe same name as the street in which Odette lived: the Lapérouse.\nSometimes, when she had been away on a short visit somewhere, several days\nwould elapse before she thought of letting him know that she had returned\nto Paris. And then she would say quite simply, without taking (as she\nwould once have taken) the precaution of covering herself, at all costs,\nwith a little fragment borrowed from the truth, that she had just, at that\nvery moment, arrived by the morning train.  What she said was a falsehood;\nat least for Odette it was a falsehood, inconsistent, lacking (what it\nwould have had, if true) the support of her memory of her actual arrival\nat the station; she was even prevented from forming a mental picture of\nwhat she was saying, while she said it, by the contradictory picture, in\nher mind, of whatever quite different thing she had indeed been doing at\nthe moment when she pretended to have been alighting from the train. In\nSwann’s mind, however, these words, meeting no opposition, settled and\nhardened until they assumed the indestructibility of a truth so\nindubitable that, if some friend happened to tell him that he had come by\nthe same train and had not seen Odette, Swann would have been convinced\nthat it was his friend who had made a mistake as to the day or hour, since\nhis version did not agree with the words uttered by Odette. These words\nhad never appeared to him false except when, before hearing them, he had\nsuspected that they were going to be. For him to believe that she was\nlying, an anticipatory suspicion was indispensable. It was also, however,\nsufficient. Given that, everything that Odette might say appeared to him\nsuspect. Did she mention a name: it was obviously that of one of her\nlovers; once this supposition had taken shape, he would spend weeks in\ntormenting himself; on one occasion he even approached a firm of ’inquiry\nagents’ to find out the address and the occupation of the unknown rival\nwho would give him no peace until he could be proved to have gone abroad,\nand who (he ultimately learned) was an uncle of Odette, and had been dead\nfor twenty years.",
        "Although she would not allow him, as a rule, to meet her at public\ngatherings, saying that people would talk, it happened occasionally that,\nat an evening party to which he and she had each been invited–at\nForcheville’s, at the painter’s, or at a charity ball given in one of the\nMinistries–he found himself in the same room with her. He could see her,\nbut dared not remain for fear of annoying her by seeming to be spying upon\nthe pleasures which she tasted in other company, pleasures which–while he\ndrove home in utter loneliness, and went to bed, as anxiously as I myself\nwas to go to bed, some years later, on the evenings when he came to dine\nwith us at Combray–seemed illimitable to him since he had not been able\nto see their end. And, once or twice, he derived from such evenings that\nkind of happiness which one would be inclined (did it not originate in so\nviolent a reaction from an anxiety abruptly terminated) to call peaceful,\nsince it consists in a pacifying of the mind: he had looked in for a\nmoment at a revel in the painter’s studio, and was getting ready to go\nhome; he was leaving behind him Odette, transformed into a brilliant\nstranger, surrounded by men to whom her glances and her gaiety, which were\nnot for him, seemed to hint at some voluptuous pleasure to be enjoyed\nthere or elsewhere (possibly at the Bal des Incohérents, to which he\ntrembled to think that she might be going on afterwards) which made Swann\nmore jealous than the thought of their actual physical union, since it was\nmore difficult to imagine; he was opening the door to go, when he heard\nhimself called back in these words (which, by cutting off from the party\nthat possible ending which had so appalled him, made the party itself seem\ninnocent in retrospect, made Odette’s return home a thing no longer\ninconceivable and terrible, but tender and familiar, a thing that kept\nclose to his side, like a part of his own daily life, in his carriage; a\nthing that stripped Odette herself of the excess of brilliance and gaiety\nin her appearance, shewed that it was only a disguise which she had\nassumed for a moment, for his sake and not in view of any mysterious\npleasures, a disguise of which she had already wearied)–in these words,\nwhich Odette flung out after him as he was crossing the threshold: “Can’t\nyou wait a minute for me? I’m just going; we’ll drive back together and\nyou can drop me.” It was true that on one occasion Forcheville had asked\nto be driven home at the same time, but when, on reaching Odette’s gate,\nhe had begged to be allowed to come in too, she had replied, with a finger\npointed at Swann: “Ah! That depends on this gentleman. You must ask him.\nVery well, you may come in, just for a minute, if you insist, but you\nmustn’t stay long, for, I warn you, he likes to sit and talk quietly with\nme, and he’s not at all pleased if I have visitors when he’s here. Oh, if\nyou only knew the creature as I know him; isn’t that so, my love, there’s\nno one that really knows you, is there, except me?”",
        "And Swann was, perhaps, even more touched by the spectacle of her\naddressing him thus, in front of Forcheville, not only in these tender\nwords of predilection, but also with certain criticisms, such as: “I feel\nsure you haven’t written yet to your friends, about dining with them on\nSunday.  You needn’t go if you don’t want to, but you might at least be\npolite,” or “Now, have you left your essay on Vermeer here, so that you\ncan do a little more to it to-morrow? What a lazy-bones! I’m going to make\nyou work, I can tell you,” which proved that Odette kept herself in touch\nwith his social engagements and his literary work, that they had indeed a\nlife in common. And as she spoke she bestowed on him a smile which he\ninterpreted as meaning that she was entirely his.",
        "And then, while she was making them some orangeade, suddenly, just as when\nthe reflector of a lamp that is badly fitted begins by casting all round\nan object, on the wall beyond it, huge and fantastic shadows which, in\ntime, contract and are lost in the shadow of the object itself, all the\nterrible and disturbing ideas which he had formed of Odette melted away\nand vanished in the charming creature who stood there before his eyes. He\nhad the sudden suspicion that this hour spent in Odette’s house, in the\nlamp-light, was, perhaps, after all, not an artificial hour, invented for\nhis special use (with the object of concealing that frightening and\ndelicious thing which was incessantly in his thoughts without his ever\nbeing able to form a satisfactory impression of it, an hour of Odette’s\nreal life, of her life when he was not there, looking on) with theatrical\nproperties and pasteboard fruits, but was perhaps a genuine hour of\nOdette’s life; that, if he himself had not been there, she would have\npulled forward the same armchair for Forcheville, would have poured out\nfor him, not any unknown brew, but precisely that orangeade which she was\nnow offering to them both; that the world inhabited by Odette was not that\nother world, fearful and supernatural, in which he spent his time in\nplacing her–and which existed, perhaps, only in his imagination, but the\nreal universe, exhaling no special atmosphere of gloom, comprising that\ntable at which he might sit down, presently, and write, and this drink\nwhich he was being permitted, now, to taste; all the objects which he\ncontemplated with as much curiosity and admiration as gratitude, for if,\nin absorbing his dreams, they had delivered him from an obsession, they\nthemselves were, in turn, enriched by the absorption; they shewed him the\npalpable realisation of his fancies, and they interested his mind; they\ntook shape and grew solid before-his eyes, and at the same time they\nsoothed his troubled heart. Ah!  had fate but allowed him to share a\nsingle dwelling with Odette, so that in her house he should be in his own;\nif, when asking his servant what there would be for luncheon, it had been\nOdette’s bill of fare that he had learned from the reply; if, when Odette\nwished to go for a walk, in the morning, along the Avenue du\nBois-de-Boulogne, his duty as a good husband had obliged him, though he\nhad no desire to go out, to accompany her, carrying her cloak when she was\ntoo warm; and in the evening, after dinner, if she wished to stay at home,\nand not to dress, if he had been forced to stay beside her, to do what she\nasked; then how completely would all the trivial details of Swann’s life,\nwhich seemed to him now so gloomy, simply because they would, at the same\ntime, have formed part of the life of Odette, have taken on–like that\nlamp, that orangeade, that armchair, which had absorbed so much of his\ndreams, which materialised so much of his longing,–a sort of\nsuperabundant sweetness and a mysterious solidity.",
        "And yet he was inclined to suspect that the state for which he so much\nlonged was a calm, a peace, which would not have created an atmosphere\nfavourable to his love. When Odette ceased to be for him a creature always\nabsent, regretted, imagined; when the feeling that he had for her was no\nlonger the same mysterious disturbance that was wrought in him by the\nphrase from the sonata, but constant affection and gratitude, when those\nnormal relations were established between them which would put an end to\nhis melancholy madness; then, no doubt, the actions of Odette’s daily life\nwould appear to him as being of but little intrinsic interest–as he had\nseveral times, already, felt that they might be, on the day, for instance,\nwhen he had read, through its envelope, her letter to Forcheville.\nExamining his complaint with as much scientific detachment as if he had\ninoculated himself with it in order to study its effects, he told himself\nthat, when he was cured of it, what Odette might or might not do would be\nindifferent to him. But in his morbid state, to tell the truth, he feared\ndeath itself no more than such a recovery, which would, in fact, amount to\nthe death of all that he then was.",
        "After these quiet evenings, Swann’s suspicions would be temporarily\nlulled; he would bless the name of Odette, and next day, in the morning,\nwould order the most attractive jewels to be sent to her, because her\nkindnesses to him overnight had excited either his gratitude, or the\ndesire to see them repeated, or a paroxysm of love for her which had need\nof some such outlet.",
        "But at other times, grief would again take hold of him; he would imagine\nthat Odette was Forcheville’s mistress, and that, when they had both sat\nwatching him from the depths of the Verdurins’ landau, in the Bois, on the\nevening before the party at Chatou to which he had not been invited, while\nhe implored her in vain, with that look of despair on his face which even\nhis coachman had noticed, to come home with him, and then turned away,\nsolitary, crushed,–she must have employed, to draw Forcheville’s\nattention to him, while she murmured: “Do look at him, storming!” the same\nglance, brilliant, malicious, sidelong, cunning, as on the evening when\nForcheville had driven Saniette from the Verdurins’.",
        "At such times Swann detested her. “But I’ve been a fool, too,” he would\nargue. “I’m paying for other men’s pleasures with my money. All the same,\nshe’d better take care, and not pull the string too often, for I might\nvery well stop giving her anything at all. At any rate, we’d better knock\noff supplementary favours for the time being. To think that, only\nyesterday, when she said she would like to go to Bayreuth for the season,\nI was such an ass as to offer to take one of those jolly little places the\nKing of Bavaria has there, for the two of us. However she didn’t seem\nparticularly keen; she hasn’t said yes or no yet. Let’s hope that she’ll\nrefuse. Good God!  Think of listening to Wagner for a fortnight on end\nwith her, who takes about as much interest in music as a fish does in\nlittle apples; it will be fun!” And his hatred, like his love, needing to\nmanifest itself in action, he amused himself with urging his evil\nimaginings further and further, because, thanks to the perfidies with\nwhich he charged Odette, he detested her still more, and would be able, if\nit turned out–as he tried to convince himself–that she was indeed guilty\nof them, to take the opportunity of punishing her, emptying upon her the\noverflowing vials of his wrath. In this way, he went so far as to suppose\nthat he was going to receive a letter from her, in which she would ask him\nfor money to take the house at Bayreuth, but with the warning that he was\nnot to come there himself, as she had promised Forcheville and the\nVerdurins to invite them. Oh, how he would have loved it, had it been\nconceivable that she would have that audacity. What joy he would have in\nrefusing, in drawing up that vindictive reply, the terms of which he\namused himself by selecting and declaiming aloud, as though he had\nactually received her letter.",
        "The very next day, her letter came. She wrote that the Verdurins and their\nfriends had expressed a desire to be present at these performances of\nWagner, and that, if he would be so good as to send her the money, she\nwould be able at last, after going so often to their house, to have the\npleasure of entertaining the Verdurins in hers. Of him she said not a\nword; it was to be taken for granted that their presence at Bayreuth would\nbe a bar to his.",
        "Then that annihilating answer, every word of which he had carefully\nrehearsed overnight, without venturing to hope that it could ever be used,\nhe had the satisfaction of having it conveyed to her. Alas! he felt only\ntoo certain that with the money which she had, or could easily procure,\nshe would be able, all the same, to take a house at Bayreuth, since she\nwished to do so, she who was incapable of distinguishing between Bach and\nClapisson.  Let her take it, then; she would have to live in it more\nfrugally, that was all. No means (as there would have been if he had\nreplied by sending her several thousand-franc notes) of organising, each\nevening, in her hired castle, those exquisite little suppers, after which\nshe might perhaps be seized by the whim (which, it was possible, had\nnever yet seized her) of falling into the arms of Forcheville. At any\nrate, this loathsome expedition, it would not be Swann who had to pay for\nit. Ah! if he could only manage to prevent it, if she could sprain her\nankle before starting, if the driver of the carriage which was to take her\nto the station would consent (no matter how great the bribe) to smuggle\nher to some place where she could be kept for a time in seclusion, that\nperfidious woman, her eyes tinselled with a smile of complicity for\nForcheville, which was what Odette had become for Swann in the last\nforty-eight hours.",
        "But she was never that for very long; after a few days the shining, crafty\neyes lost their brightness and their duplicity, that picture of an\nexecrable Odette saying to Forcheville: “Look at him storming!” began to\ngrow pale and to dissolve. Then gradually reappeared and rose before him,\nsoftly radiant, the face of the other Odette, of that Odette who al^o\nturned with a smile to Forcheville, but with a smile in which there was\nnothing but affection for Swann, when she said: “You mustn’t stay long,\nfor this gentleman doesn’t much like my having visitors when he’s here.\nOh! if you only knew the creature as I know him!” that same smile with\nwhich she used to thank Swann for some instance of his courtesy which she\nprized so highly, for some advice for which she had asked him in one of\nthose grave crises in her life, when she could turn to him alone.",
        "Then, to this other Odette, he would ask himself what could have induced\nhim to write that outrageous letter, of which, probably, until then, she\nhad never supposed him capable, a letter which must have lowered him from\nthe high, from the supreme place which, by his generosity, by his loyalty,\nhe had won for himself in her esteem. He would become less dear to her,\nsince it was for those qualities, which she found neither in Forcheville\nnor in any other, that she loved him. It was for them that Odette so often\nshewed him a reciprocal kindness, which counted for less than nothing in\nhis moments of jealousy, because it was not a sign of reciprocal desire,\nwas indeed a proof rather of affection than of love, but the importance of\nwhich he began once more to feel in proportion as the spontaneous\nrelaxation of his suspicions, often accelerated by the distraction brought\nto him by reading about art or by the conversation of a friend, rendered\nhis passion less exacting of reciprocities.",
        "Now that, after this swing of the pendulum, Odette had naturally returned\nto the place from which Swann’s jealousy had for the moment driven her, in\nthe angle in which he found her charming, he pictured her to himself as\nfull of tenderness, with a look of consent in her eyes, and so beautiful\nthat he could not refrain from moving his lips towards her, as though she\nhad actually been in the room for him to kiss; and he preserved a sense of\ngratitude to her for that bewitching, kindly glance, as strong as though\nshe had really looked thus at him, and it had not been merely his\nimagination that had portrayed it in order to satisfy his desire.",
        "What distress he must have caused her! Certainly he found adequate reasons\nfor his resentment, but they would not have been sufficient to make him\nfeel that resentment, if he had not so passionately loved her. Had he not\nnourished grievances, just as serious, against other women, to whom he\nwould, none the less, render willing service to-day, feeling no anger\ntowards them because he no longer loved them? If the day ever came when he\nwould find himself in the same state of indifference with regard to\nOdette, he would then understand that it was his jealousy alone which had\nled him to find something atrocious, unpardonable, in this desire (after\nall, so natural a desire, springing from a childlike ingenuousness and\nalso from a certain delicacy in her nature) to be able, in her turn, when\nan occasion offered, to repay the Verdurins for their hospitality, and to\nplay the hostess in a house of her own.",
        "He returned to the other point of view–opposite to that of his love and\nof his jealousy, to which he resorted at times by a sort of mental equity,\nand in order to make allowance for different eventualities–from which he\ntried to form a fresh judgment of Odette, based on the supposition that he\nhad never been in love with her, that she was to him just a woman like\nother women, that her life had not been (whenever he himself was not\npresent) different, a texture woven in secret apart from him, and warped\nagainst him.",
        "Wherefore believe that she would enjoy down there with Forcheville or with\nother men intoxicating pleasures which she had never known with him, and\nwhich his jealousy alone had fabricated in all their elements? At\nBayreuth, as in Paris, if it should happen that Forcheville thought of him\nat all, it would only be as of some one who counted for a great deal in\nthe life of Odette, some one for whom he was obliged to make way, when\nthey met in her house. If Forcheville and she scored a triumph by being\ndown there together in spite of him, it was he who had engineered that\ntriumph by striving in vain to prevent her from going there, whereas if he\nhad approved of her plan, which for that matter was quite defensible, she\nwould have had the appearance of being there by his counsel, she would\nhave felt herself sent there, housed there by him, and for the pleasure\nwhich she derived from entertaining those people who had so often\nentertained her, it was to him that she would have had to acknowledge her\nindebtedness.",
        "And if–instead of letting her go off thus, at cross-purposes with him,\nwithout having seen him again–he were to send her this money, if he were\nto encourage her to take this journey, and to go out of his way to make it\ncomfortable and pleasant for her, she would come running to him, happy,\ngrateful, and he would have the joy–the sight of her face–which he had\nnot known for nearly a week, a joy which none other could replace.  For\nthe moment that Swann was able to form a picture of her without revulsion,\nthat he could see once again the friendliness in her smile, and that the\ndesire to tear her away from every rival was no longer imposed by his\njealousy upon his love, that love once again became, more than anything, a\ntaste for the sensations which Odette’s person gave him, for the pleasure\nwhich he found in admiring, as one might a spectacle, or in questioning,\nas one might a phenomenon, the birth of one of her glances, the formation\nof one of her smiles, the utterance of an intonation of her voice. And\nthis pleasure, different from every other, had in the end created in him a\nneed of her, which she alone, by her presence or by her letters, could\nassuage, almost as disinterested, almost as artistic, as perverse as\nanother need which characterised this new period in Swann’s life, when the\nsereness, the depression of the preceding years had been followed by a\nsort of spiritual superabundance, without his knowing to what he owed this\nunlooked-for enrichment of his life, any more than a person in delicate\nhealth who from a certain moment grows stronger, puts on flesh, and seems\nfor a time to be on the road to a complete recovery:–this other need,\nwhich, too, developed in him independently of the visible, material world,\nwas the need to listen to music and to learn to know it.",
        "And so, by the chemical process of his malady, after he had created\njealousy out of his love, he began again to generate tenderness, pity for\nOdette. She had become once more the old Odette, charming and kind. He was\nfull of remorse for having treated her harshly. He wished her to come to\nhim, and, before she came, he wished to have already procured for her some\npleasure, so as to watch her gratitude taking shape in her face and\nmoulding her smile.",
        "So, too, Odette, certain of seeing him come to her in a few days, as\ntender and submissive as before, and plead with her for a reconciliation,\nbecame inured, was no longer afraid of displeasing him, or even of making\nhim angry, and refused him, whenever it suited her, the favours by which\nhe set most store.",
        "Perhaps she did not realise how sincere he had been with her during their\nquarrel, when he had told her that he would not send her any money, but\nwould do what he could to hurt her. Perhaps she did not realise, either,\nhow sincere he still was, if not with her, at any rate with himself, on\nother occasions when, for the sake of their future relations, to shew\nOdette that he was capable of doing without her, that a rupture was still\npossible between them, he decided to wait some time before going to see\nher again.",
        "Sometimes several days had elapsed, during which she had caused him no\nfresh anxiety; and as, from the next few visits which he would pay her, he\nknew that he was likely to derive not any great pleasure, but, more\nprobably, some annoyance which would put an end to the state of calm in\nwhich he found himself, he wrote to her that he was very busy, and would\nnot be able to see her on any of the days that he had suggested.\nMeanwhile, a letter from her, crossing his, asked him to postpone one of\nthose very meetings. He asked himself, why; his suspicions, his grief,\nagain took hold of him. He could no longer abide, in the new state of\nagitation into which he found himself plunged, by the arrangements which\nhe had made in his preceding state of comparative calm; he would run to\nfind her, and would insist upon seeing her on each of the following days.\nAnd even if she had not written first, if she merely acknowledged his\nletter, it was enough to make him unable to rest without seeing her. For,\nupsetting all Swann’s calculations, Odette’s acceptance had entirely\nchanged his attitude. Like everyone who possesses something precious, so\nas to know what would happen if he ceased for a moment to possess it, he\nhad detached the precious object from his mind, leaving, as he thought,\neverything else in the same state as when it was there. But the absence of\none part from a whole is not only that, it is not simply a partial\nomission, it is a disturbance of all the other parts, a new state which it\nwas impossible to foresee from the old.",
        "But at other times–when Odette was on the point of going away for a\nholiday–it was after some trifling quarrel for which he had chosen the\npretext, that he decided not to write to her and not to see her until her\nreturn, giving the appearance (and expecting the reward) of a serious\nrupture, which she would perhaps regard as final, to a separation, the\ngreater part of which was inevitable, since she was going away, which, in\nfact, he was merely allowing to start a little sooner than it must. At\nonce he could imagine Odette, puzzled, anxious, distressed at having\nreceived neither visit nor letter from him and this picture of her, by\ncalming his jealousy, made it easy for him to break himself of the habit\nof seeing her.  At odd moments, no doubt, in the furthest recesses of his\nbrain, where his determination had thrust it away, and thanks to the\nlength of the interval, the three weeks’ separation to which he had\nagreed, it was with pleasure that he would consider the idea that he would\nsee Odette again on her return; but it was also with so little impatience\nthat he began to ask himself whether he would not readily consent to the\ndoubling of the period of so easy an abstinence. It had lasted, so far,\nbut three days, a much shorter time than he had often, before, passed\nwithout seeing Odette, and without having, as on this occasion he had,\npremeditated a separation.  And yet, there and then, some tiny trace of\ncontrariety in his mind, or of weakness in his body,–by inciting him to\nregard the present as an exceptional moment, one not to be governed by the\nrules, one in which prudence itself would allow him to take advantage of\nthe soothing effects of a pleasure and to give his will (until the time\nshould come when its efforts might serve any purpose) a holiday–suspended\nthe action of his will, which ceased to exert its inhibitive control; or,\nwithout that even, the thought of some information for which he had\nforgotten to ask Odette, such as if she had decided in what colour she\nwould have her carriage repainted, or, with regard to some investment,\nwhether they were ’ordinary’ or ’preference’ shares that she wished him to\nbuy (for it was all very well to shew her that he could live without\nseeing her, but if, after that, the carriage had to be painted over again,\nif the shares produced no dividend, a fine lot of good he would have\ndone),–and suddenly, like a stretched piece of elastic which is let go,\nor the air in a pneumatic machine which is ripped open, the idea of seeing\nher again, from the remote point in time to which it had been attached,\nsprang back into the field of the present and of immediate possibilities.",
        "It sprang back thus without meeting any further resistance, so\nirresistible, in fact, that Swann had been far less unhappy in watching\nthe end gradually approaching, day by day, of the fortnight which he must\nspend apart from Odette, than he was when kept waiting ten minutes while\nhis coachman brought round the carriage which was to take him to her,\nminutes which he passed in transports of impatience and joy, in which he\nrecaptured a thousand times over, to lavish on it all the wealth of his\naffection, that idea of his meeting with Odette, which, by so abrupt a\nrepercussion, at a moment when he supposed it so remote, was once more\npresent and on the very surface of his consciousness. The fact was that\nthis idea no longer found, as an obstacle in its course, the desire to\ncontrive without further delay to resist its coming, which had ceased to\nhave any place in Swann’s mind since, having proved to himself–or so, at\nleast, he believed–that he was so easily capable of resisting it, he no\nlonger saw any inconvenience in postponing a plan of separation which he\nwas now certain of being able to put into operation whenever he would.\nFurthermore, this idea of seeing her again came back to him adorned with a\nnovelty, a seductiveness, armed with a virulence, all of which long habit\nhad enfeebled, but which had acquired new vigour during this privation,\nnot of three days but of a fortnight (for a period of abstinence may be\ncalculated, by anticipation, as having lasted already until the final date\nassigned to it), and had converted what had been, until then, a pleasure\nin store, which could easily be sacrificed, into an unlooked-for happiness\nwhich he was powerless to resist. Finally, the idea returned to him with\nits beauty enhanced by his own ignorance of what Odette might have\nthought, might, perhaps, have done on finding that he shewed no sign of\nlife, with the result that he was going now to meet with the entrancing\nrevelation of an Odette almost unknown.",
        "But she, just as she had supposed that his refusal to send her money was\nonly a feint, saw nothing but a pretext in the question which he came,\nnow, to ask her, about the repainting of her carriage, or the purchase of\nstock. For she could not reconstruct the several phases of these crises\nthrough which he passed, and in the general idea which she formed of them\nshe made no attempt to understand their mechanism, looking only to what\nshe knew beforehand, their necessary, never-failing and always identical\ntermination. An imperfect idea (though possibly all the more profound in\nconsequence), if one were to judge it from the point of view of Swann, who\nwould doubtless have considered that Odette failed to understand him, just\nas a morphinomaniac or a consumptive, each persuaded that he has been\nthrown back, one by some outside event, at the moment when he was just\ngoing to shake himself free from his inveterate habit, the other by an\naccidental indisposition at the moment when he was just going to be\nfinally cured, feels himself to be misunderstood by the doctor who does\nnot attach the same importance to these pretended contingencies, mere\ndisguises, according to him, assumed, so as to be perceptible by his\npatients, by the vice of one and the morbid state of the other, which in\nreality have never ceased to weigh heavily and incurably upon them while\nthey were nursing their dreams of normality and health.  And, as a matter\nof fact, Swann’s love had reached that stage at which the physician and\n(in the case of certain affections) the boldest of surgeons ask themselves\nwhether to deprive a patient of his vice or to rid him of his malady is\nstill reasonable, or indeed possible.",
        "Certainly, of the extent of this love Swann had no direct knowledge.  When\nhe sought to measure it, it happened sometimes that he found it\ndiminished, shrunken almost to nothing; for instance, the very moderate\nliking, amounting almost to dislike, which, in the days before he was in\nlove with Odette, he had felt for her expressive features, her faded\ncomplexion, returned on certain days. “Really, I am making distinct\nheadway,” he would tell himself on the morrow, “when I come to think it\nover carefully, I find out that I got hardly any pleasure, last night, out\nof being in bed with her; it’s an odd thing, but I actually thought her\nugly.” And certainly he was sincere, but his love extended a long way\nbeyond the province of physical desire. Odette’s person, indeed, no longer\nheld any great place in it. When his eyes fell upon the photograph of\nOdette on his table, or when she came to see him, he had difficulty in\nidentifying her face, either in the flesh or on the pasteboard, with the\npainful and continuous anxiety which dwelt in his mind. He would say to\nhimself, almost with astonishment, “It is she!” as when suddenly some one\nshews us in a detached, externalised form one of our own maladies, and we\nfind in it no resemblance to what we are suffering. “She?\"–he tried to\nask himself what that meant; for it is something like love, like death\n(rather than like those vague conceptions of maladies), a thing which one\nrepeatedly calls in question, in order to make oneself probe further into\nit, in the fear that the question will find no answer, that the substance\nwill escape our grasp–the mystery of personality. And this malady, which\nwas Swann’s love, had so far multiplied, was so closely interwoven with\nall his habits, with all his actions, with his thoughts, his health, his\nsleep, his life, even with what he hoped for after his death, was so\nentirely one with him that it would have been impossible to wrest it away\nwithout almost entirely destroying him; as surgeons say, his case was past\noperation.",
        "By this love Swann had been so far detached from all other interests that\nwhen by chance he reappeared in the world of fashion, reminding himself\nthat his social relations, like a beautifully wrought setting (although\nshe would not have been able to form any very exact estimate of its\nworth), might, still, add a little to his own value in Odette’s eyes (as\nindeed they might have done had they not been cheapened by his love\nitself, which for Odette depreciated everything that it touched by seeming\nto denounce such things as less precious than itself), he would feel\nthere, simultaneously with his distress at being in places and among\npeople that she did not know, the same detached sense of pleasure as he\nwould have derived from a novel or a painting in which were depicted the\namusements of a leisured class; just as, at home, he used to enjoy the\nthought of the smooth efficiency of his household, the smartness of his\nown wardrobe and of his servants’ liveries, the soundness of his\ninvestments, with the same relish as when he read in Saint-Simon, who was\none of his favourite authors, of the machinery of daily life at\nVersailles, what Mme. de Maintenon ate and drank, or the shrewd avarice\nand great pomp of Lulli. And in the small extent to which this detachment\nwas not absolute, the reason for this new pleasure which Swann was tasting\nwas that he could emigrate for a moment into those few and distant parts\nof himself which had remained almost foreign to his love and to his pain.\nIn this respect the personality, with which my great-aunt endowed him, of\n’young Swann,’ as distinct from the more individual personality of Charles\nSwann, was that in which he now most delighted. Once when, because it was\nthe birthday of the Princesse de Parme (and because she could often be of\nuse, indirectly, to Odette, by letting her have seats for galas and\njubilees and all that sort of thing), he had decided to send her a basket\nof fruit, and was not quite sure where or how to order it, he had\nentrusted the task to a cousin of his mother who, delighted to be doing a\ncommission for him, had written to him, laying stress on the fact that she\nhad not chosen all the fruit at the same place, but the grapes from\nCrapote, whose speciality they were, the straw berries from Jauret, the\npears from Chevet, who always had the best, am soon, “every fruit visited\nand examined, one by one, by myself.” And ii the sequel, by the cordiality\nwith which the Princess thanked him, hi had been able to judge of the\nflavour of the strawberries and of the ripe ness of the pears. But, most\nof all, that “every fruit visited and examinee one by one, by myself” had\nbrought balm to his sufferings by carrying hi mind off to a region which\nhe rarely visited, although it was his by right, as the heir of a rich and\nrespectable middle-class family in which had been handed down from\ngeneration to generation the knowledge of the ’right places’ and the art\nof ordering things from shops.",
        "Of a truth, he had too long forgotten that he was ’young Swann’ not to\nfeel, when he assumed that part again for a moment, a keener pleasure than\nhe was capable of feeling at other times–when, indeed, he was grown sick\nof pleasure; and if the friendliness of the middle-class people, for whom\nhe had never been anything else than ’young Swann,’ was less animated than\nthat of the aristocrats (though more flattering, for all that, since in\nthe middle-class mind friendship is inseparable from respect), no letter\nfrom a Royal Personage, offering him some princely entertainment, could\never be so attractive to Swann as the letter which asked him to be a\nwitness, or merely to be present at a wedding in the family of some old\nfriends of his parents; some of whom had ’kept up’ with him, like my\ngrandfather, who, the year before these events, had invited him to my\nmother’s wedding, while others barely knew him by sight, but were, they\nthought, in duty bound to shew civility to the son, to the worthy\nsuccessor of the late M. Swann.",
        "But, by virtue of his intimacy, already time-honoured, with so many of\nthem, the people of fashion, in a certain sense, were also a part of his\nhouse, his service, and his family. He felt, when his mind dwelt upon his\nbrilliant connections, the same external support, the same solid comfort\nas when he looked at the fine estate, the fine silver, the fine\ntable-linen which had come down to him from his forebears. And the thought\nthat, if he were seized by a sudden illness and confined to the house, the\npeople whom his valet would instinctively run to find would be the Duc de\nChartres, the Prince de Reuss, the Duc de Luxembourg and the Baron de\nCharlus, brought him the same consolation as our old Françoise derived\nfrom the knowledge that she would, one day, be buried in her own fine\nclothes, marked with her name, not darned at all (or so exquisitely darned\nthat it merely enhanced one’s idea of the skill and patience of the\nseamstress), a shroud from the constant image of which in her mind’s eye\nshe drew a certain satisfactory sense, if not actually of wealth and\nprosperity, at any rate of self-esteem. But most of all,–since in every\none of his actions and thoughts which had reference to Odette, Swann was\nconstantly subdued and swayed by the unconfessed feeling that he was,\nperhaps not less dear, but at least less welcome to her than anyone, even\nthe most wearisome of the Verdurins’ ’faithful,’–when he betook himself\nto a world in which he was the paramount example of taste, a man whom no\npains were spared to attract, whom people were genuinely sorry not to see,\nhe began once again to believe in the existence of a happier life,\nalmost to feel an appetite for it, as an invalid may feel who has been in\nbed for months and on a strict diet, when he picks up a newspaper and\nreads the account of an official banquet or the advertisement of a cruise\nround Sicily.",
        "If he was obliged to make excuses to his fashionable friends for not\npaying them visits, it was precisely for the visits that he did pay her\nthat he sought to excuse himself to Odette. He still paid them (asking\nhimself at the end of each month whether, seeing that he had perhaps\nexhausted her patience, and had certainly gone rather often to see her, it\nwould be enough if he sent her four thousand francs), and for each visit\nhe found a pretext, a present that he had to bring her, some information\nwhich she required, M. de Charlus, whom he had met actually going to her\nhouse, and who had insisted upon Swann’s accompanying him. And, failing\nany excuse, he would beg M. de Charlus to go to her at once, and to tell\nher, as though spontaneously, in the course of conversation, that he had\njust remembered something that he had to say to Swann, and would she\nplease send a message to Swann’s house asking him to come to her then and\nthere; but as a rule Swann waited at home in vain, and M. de Charlus\ninformed him, later in the evening, that his device had not proved\nsuccessful. With the result that, if she was now frequently away from\nParis, even when she was there he scarcely saw her; that she who, when she\nwas in love with him, used to say, “I am always free” and “What can it\nmatter to me, what other people think?” now, whenever he wanted to see\nher, appealed to the proprieties or pleaded some engagement. When he spoke\nof going to a charity entertainment, or a private view, or a first-night\nat which she was to be present, she would expostulate that he wished to\nadvertise their relations in public, that he was treating her like a woman\noff the streets.  Things came to such a pitch that, in an effort to save\nhimself from being altogether forbidden to meet her anywhere, Swann,\nremembering that she knew and was deeply attached to my great-uncle\nAdolphe, whose friend he himself also had been, went one day to see him in\nhis little flat in the Rue de Bellechasse, to ask him to use his influence\nwith Odette. As it happened, she invariably adopted, when she spoke to\nSwann about my uncle, a poetical tone, saying: “Ah, he! He is not in the\nleast like you; it is an exquisite thing, a great, a beautiful thing, his\nfriendship for me. He’s not the sort of man who would have so little\nconsideration for me as to let himself be seen with me everywhere in\npublic.” This was embarrassing for Swann, who did not know quite to what\nrhetorical pitch he should screw himself up in speaking of Odette to my\nuncle. He began by alluding to her excellence, a priori, the axiom of\nher seraphic super-humanity, the revelation of her inexpressible virtues,\nno conception of which could possibly be formed. “I should like to speak\nto you about her,” he went on, “you, who know what a woman supreme above\nall women, what an adorable being, what an angel Odette is. But you know,\nalso, what life is in Paris.  Everyone doesn’t see Odette in the light in\nwhich you and I have been Privileged to see her. And so there are people\nwho think that I am behaving rather foolishly; she won’t even allow me to\nmeet her out of doors, at the theatre. Now you, in whom she has such\nenormous confidence, couldn’t you say a few words for me to her, just to\nassure her that she exaggerate the harm which my bowing to her in the\nstreet might do her?”",
        "My uncle advised Swann not to see Odette for some days, after which she\nwould love him all the more; he advised Odette to let Swann meet he;\neverywhere, and as often as he pleased. A few days later Odette told Swann\nthat she had just had a rude awakening; she had discovered that my uncle\nwas the same as other men; he had tried to take her by assault. She calmed\nSwann, who, at first, was for rushing out to challenge my uncle to a duel,\nbut he refused to shake hands with him when they met again. He regretted\nthis rupture all the more because he had hoped, if he had met my uncle\nAdolphe again sometimes and had contrived to talk things over with him in\nstrict confidence, to be able to get him to throw a light on certain\nrumours with regard to the life that Odette had led, in the old days, at\nNice. For my uncle Adolphe used to spend the winter there, and Swann\nthought that it might indeed have been there, perhaps, that he had first\nknown Odette.  The few words which some one had let fall, in his hearing,\nabout a man who, it appeared, had been Odette’s lover, had left Swann dumb\nfoundered.  But the very things which he would, before knowing them, have\nregarded as the most terrible to learn and the most impossible to believe,\nwere, once he knew them, incorporated for all time in the general mass of\nhis sorrow; he admitted them, he could no longer have understood their not\nexisting.  Only, each one of them in its passage traced an indelible line,\naltering the picture that he had formed of his mistress. At one time\nindeed he felt that he could understand that this moral ’lightness,’ of\nwhich he would never have suspected Odette, was perfectly well known, and\nthat at Baden or Nice, when she had gone, in the past, to spend several\nmonths in one or the other place, she had enjoyed a sort of amorous\nnotoriety. He attempted, in order to question them, to get into touch\nagain with certain men of that stamp; but these were aware that he knew\nOdette, and, besides, he was afraid of putting the thought of her into\ntheir heads, of setting them once more upon her track. But he, to whom, up\ntill then, nothing could have seemed so tedious as was all that pertained\nto the cosmopolitan life of Baden or of Nice, now that he learned that\nOdette had, perhaps, led a ’gay’ life once in those pleasure-cities,\nalthough he could never find out whether it had been solely to satisfy a\nwant of money which, thanks to himself, she no longer felt, or from some\ncapricious instinct which might, at any moment, revive in her, he would\nlean, in impotent anguish, blinded and dizzy, over the bottomless abyss\ninto which had passed, in which had been engulfed those years of his own,\nearly in MacMahon’s Septennat, in which one spent the winter on the\nPromenade des Anglais, the summer beneath the limes of Baden, and would\nfind in those years a sad but splendid profundity, such as a poet might\nhave lent to them; and he would have devoted to the reconstruction of all\nthe insignificant details that made up the daily round on the Côte d’Azur\nin those days, if it could have helped him to understand something that\nstill baffled him in the smile or in the eyes of Odette, more enthusiasm\nthan does the aesthete who ransacks the extant documents of\nfifteenth-century Florence, so as to try to penetrate further into the\nsoul of the Primavera, the fair Vanna or the Venus of Botticelli. He would\nsit, often, without saying a word to her, only gazing at her and dreaming;\nand she would comment: “You do look sad!” It was not very long since, from\nthe idea that she was an excellent creature, comparable to the best women\nthat he had known, he had passed to that of her being ’kept’; and yet\nalready, by an inverse process, he had returned from the Odette de Crécy,\nperhaps too well known to the holiday-makers, to the ’ladies’ men’ of Nice\nand Baden, to this face, the expression on which was so often gentle, to\nthis nature so eminently human. He would ask himself: “What does it mean,\nafter all, to say that everyone at Nice knows who Odette de Crécy is?\nReputations of that sort, even when they’re true, are always based upon\nother people’s ideas\"; he would reflect that this legend–even if it were\nauthentic–was something external to Odette, was not inherent in her like\na mischievous and ineradicable personality; that the creature who might\nhave been led astray was a woman with frank eyes, a heart full of pity for\nthe sufferings of others, a docile body which he had pressed tightly in\nhis arms and explored with his fingers, a woman of whom he might one day\ncome into absolute possession if he succeeded in making himself\nindispensable to her. There she was, often tired, her face left blank for\nthe nonce by that eager, feverish preoccupation with the unknown things\nwhich made Swann suffer; she would push back her hair with both hands; her\nforehead, her whole face would seem to grow larger; then, suddenly, some\nordinary human thought, some worthy sentiment such as is to be found in\nall creatures when, in a moment of rest or meditation, they are free to\nexpress themselves, would flash out from her eyes like a ray of gold. And\nimmediately the whole of her face would light up like a grey landscape,\nswathed in clouds which, suddenly, are swept away and the dull scene\ntransfigured, at the moment of the sun’s setting.  The life which occupied\nOdette at such times, even the future which she seemed to be dreamily\nregarding, Swann could have shared with her. No evil disturbance seemed to\nhave left any effect on them. Rare as they became, those moments did not\noccur in vain. By the process of memory, Swann joined the fragments\ntogether, abolished the intervals between them, cast, as in molten gold,\nthe image of an Odette compact of kindness and tranquillity, for whom he\nwas to make, later on (as we shall see in the second part of this story)\nsacrifices which the other Odette would never have won from him. But how\nrare those moments were, and how seldom he now saw her! Even in regard to\ntheir evening meetings, she would never tell him until the last minute\nwhether she would be able to see him, for, reckoning on his being always\nfree, she wished first to be certain that no one else would offer to come\nto her. She would plead that she was obliged to wait for an answer which\nwas of the very greatest importance, and if, even after she had made Swann\ncome to her house, any of her friends asked her, half-way through the\nevening, to join them at some theatre, or at supper afterwards, she would\njump for joy and dress herself with all speed.  As her toilet progressed,\nevery movement that she made brought Swann nearer to the moment when he\nwould have to part from her, when she would fly off with irresistible\nforce; and when at length she was ready, and, Plunging into her mirror a\nlast glance strained and brightened by her anxiety to look well, smeared a\nlittle salve on her lips, fixed a stray loci of hair over her brow, and\ncalled for her cloak of sky-blue silk with golden tassels, Swann would be\nlooking so wretched that she would be unable to restrain a gesture of\nimpatience as she flung at him: “So that is how you thank me for keeping\nyou here till the last minute! And I thought I was being so nice to you.\nWell, I shall know better another time!” Sometime ... at the risk of\nannoying her, he made up his mind that he would find out where she had\ngone, and even dreamed of a defensive alliance with Forcheville, who might\nperhaps have been able to tell him. But anyhow, when he knew with whom she\nwas spending the evening, it was very seldom that he could not discover,\namong all his innumerable acquaintance, some one who knew–if only\nindirectly–the man with whom she had gone out, and could easily obtain\nthis or that piece of information about him. And while he was writing to\none of his friends, asking him to try to get a little light thrown upon\nsome point or other, he would feel a sense of relief on ceasing to vex\nhimself with questions to which there was no answer and transferring to\nsome one else the strain of interrogation. It is true that Swann was\nlittle the wiser for such information as he did receive. To know a thing\ndoes not enable us, always, to prevent its happening, but after all the\nthings that we know we do hold, if not in our hands, at any rate in our\nminds, where we can dispose of them as we choose, which gives us the\nillusion of a sort of power to control them. He was quite happy whenever\nM. de Charlus was with Odette. He knew that between M. de Charlus and her\nnothing untoward could ever happen, that when M. de Charlus went anywhere\nwith her, it was out of friendship for himself, and that he would make no\ndifficulty about telling him everything that she had done.  Sometimes she\nhad declared so emphatically to Swann that it was impossible for him to\nsee her on a particular evening, she seemed to be looking forward so\nkeenly to some outing, that Swann attached a very real importance to the\nfact that M. de Charlus was free to accompany her. Next day, without\ndaring to put many questions to M. de Charlus, he would force him, by\nappearing not quite to understand his first answers, to give him more,\nafter each of which he would feel himself increasingly relieved, for he\nvery soon learned that Odette had spent her evening in the most innocent\nof dissipations.",
        "“But what do you mean, my dear Mémé, I don’t quite understand....  You\ndidn’t go straight from her house to the Musée Grévin? Surely you went\nsomewhere else first? No? That is very odd! You don’t know how amusing you\nare, my dear Mémé. But what an odd idea of hers to go on to the Chat Noir\nafterwards; it was her idea, I suppose? No? Yours?  That’s strange. After\nall, it wasn’t a bad idea; she must have known dozens of people there? No?\nShe never spoke to a soul? How extraordinary! Then you sat there like\nthat, just you and she, all by yourselves? I can picture you, sitting\nthere! You are a worthy fellow, my dear Mémé; I’m exceedingly fond of\nyou.”",
        "Swann was now quite at ease. To him, who had so often happened, when\ntalking to friends who knew nothing of his love, friends to whom he hardly\nlistened, to hear certain detached sentences (as, for instance, “I saw\nMme.  de Crécy yesterday; she was with a man I didn’t know.”), sentences\nwhich dropped into his heart and passed at once into a solid state, grew\nhard as stalagmites, and seared and tore him as they lay there\nirremovable,–how charming, by way of contrast, were the words: “She didn’t\nknow a soul; she never spoke to a soul.” How freely they coursed through\nhim, how fluid they were, how vaporous, how easy to breathe! And yet, a\nmoment later, he was telling himself that Odette must find him very dull\nif those were the pleasures that she preferred to his company. And their\nvery insignificance, though it reassured him, pained him as if her\nenjoyment of them had been an act of treachery.",
        "Even when he could not discover where she had gone, it would have sufficed\nto alleviate the anguish that he then felt, for which Odette’s presence,\nthe charm of her company, was the sole specific (a specific which in the\nlong run served, like many other remedies, to aggravate the disease, but\nat least brought temporary relief to his sufferings), it would have\nsufficed, had Odette only permitted him to remain in her house while she\nwas out, to wait there until that hour of her return, into whose stillness\nand peace would flow, to be mingled and lost there, all memory of those\nintervening hours which some sorcery, some cursed spell had made him\nimagine as, somehow, different from the rest. But she would not; he must\nreturn home; he forced himself, on the way, to form various plans, ceased\nto think of Odette; he even reached the stage, while he undressed, of\nturning over all sorts of happy ideas in his mind: it was with a light\nheart, buoyed with the anticipation of going to see some favourite work of\nart on the morrow, that he jumped into bed and turned out the light; but\nno sooner had he made himself ready to sleep, relaxing a self-control of\nwhich he was not even conscious, so habitual had it become, than an icy\nshudder convulsed his body and he burst into sobs. He did not wish to know\nwhy, but dried his eyes, saying with a smile: “This is delightful; I’m\nbecoming neurasthenic.” After which he could not save himself from utter\nexhaustion at the thought that, next day, he must begin afresh his attempt\nto find out what Odette had been doing, must use all his influence to\ncontrive to see her. This compulsion to an activity without respite,\nwithout variety, without result, was so cruel a scourge that one day,\nnoticing a swelling over his stomach, he felt an actual joy in the idea\nthat he had, perhaps, a tumour which would prove fatal, that he need not\nconcern himself with anything further, that it was his malady which was\ngoing to govern his life, to make a plaything of him, until the\nnot-distant end. If indeed, at this period, it often happened that, though\nwithout admitting it even to himself, he longed for death, it was in order\nto escape not so much from the keenness of his sufferings as from the\nmonotony of his struggle.",
        "And yet he would have wished to live until the time came when he no longer\nloved her, when she would have no reason for lying to him, when at length\nhe might learn from her whether, on the day when he had gone to see her in\nthe afternoon, she had or had not been in the arms of Forcheville.  Often\nfor several days on end the suspicion that she was in love with some one\nelse would distract his mind from the question of Forcheville, making it\nalmost immaterial to him, like those new developments of a continuous\nstate of ill-health which seem for a little time to have delivered us from\ntheir predecessors. There were even days when he was not tormented by any\nsuspicion. He fancied that he was cured. But next morning, when he awoke,\nhe felt in the same place the same pain, a sensation which, the day\nbefore, he had, as it were, diluted in the torrent of different\nimpressions.  But it had not stirred from its place. Indeed, it was the\nsharpness of this pain that had awakened him.",
        "Since Odette never gave him any information as to those vastly important\nmatters which took up so much of her time every day (albeit he had lived\nlong enough in the world to know that such matters are never anything else\nthan pleasures) he could not sustain for any length of time the effort to\nimagine them; his brain would become a void; then he would pass a finger\nover his tired eyelids, in the same way as he might have wiped his\neyeglass, and would cease altogether to think. There emerged, however,\nfrom this unexplored tract, certain occupations which reappeared from time\nto time, vaguely connected by Odette with some obligation towards distant\nrelatives or old friends who, inasmuch as they were the only people whom\nshe was in the habit of mentioning as preventing her from seeing him,\nseemed to Swann to compose the necessary, unalterable setting of her life.\nBecause of the tone in which she referred, from time to time, to “the day\nwhen I go with my friend to the Hippodrome,” if, when he felt unwell and\nhad thought, “Perhaps Odette would be kind and come to see me,” he\nremembered, suddenly, that it was one of those very days, he would correct\nhimself with an “Oh, no! It’s not worth while asking her to come; I should\nhave thought of it before, this is the day when she goes with her friend\nto the Hippodrome. We must confine ourselves to what is possible; no use\nwasting our time in proposing things that can’t be accepted and are\ndeclined in advance.” And this duty that was incumbent upon Odette, of\ngoing to the Hippodrome, to which Swann thus gave way, seemed to him to be\nnot merely ineluctable in itself; but the mark of necessity which stamped\nit seemed to make plausible and legitimate everything that was even\nremotely connected with it. If, when Odette, in the street, had\nacknowledged the salute of a passer-by, which had aroused Swann’s\njealousy, she replied to his questions by associating the stranger with\nany of the two or three paramount duties of which she had often spoken to\nhim; if, for instance, she said: “That’s a gentleman who was in my\nfriend’s box the other day; the one I go to the Hippodrome with,” that\nexplanation would set Swann’s suspicions at rest; it was, after all,\ninevitable that this friend should have other guests than Odette in her\nbox at the Hippodrome, but he had never sought to form or succeeded in\nforming any coherent impression of them. Oh! how he would have loved to\nknow her, that friend who went to the Hippodrome, how he would have loved\nher to invite him there with Odette. How readily he would have sacrificed\nall his acquaintance for no matter what person who was in the habit of\nseeing Odette, were she but a manicurist or a girl out of a shop. He would\nhave taken more trouble, incurred more expense for them than for queens.\nWould they not have supplied him, out of what was contained in their\nknowledge of the life of Odette, with the one potent anodyne for his pain?\nWith what joy would he have hastened to spend his days with one or other\nof those humble folk with whom Odette kept up friendly relations, either\nwith some ulterior motive or from genuine simplicity of nature. How\nwillingly would he have fixed his abode for ever in the attics of some\nsordid but enviable house, where Odette went but never took him, and\nwhere, if he had lived with the little retired dressmaker, whose lover he\nwould readily have pretended to be, he would have been visited by. Odette\nalmost daily.  In those regions, that were almost slums, what a modest\nexistence, abject, if you please, but delightful, nourished by\ntranquillity and happiness, he would have consented to lead indefinitely.",
        "It sometimes happened, again, that, when, after meeting Swann, she saw\nsome man approaching whom he did not know, he could distinguish upon\nOdette’s face that look of sorrow which she had worn on the day when he\nhad come to her while Forcheville was there. But this was rare; for, on\nthe days when, in spite of all that she had to do, and of her dread of\nwhat people would think, she did actually manage to see Swann, the\npredominant quality in her attitude, now, was self-assurance; a striking\ncontrast, perhaps an unconscious revenge for, perhaps a natural reaction\nfrom the timorous emotion which, in the early days of their friendship,\nshe had felt in his presence, and even in his absence, when she began a\nletter to him with the words: “My dear, my hand trembles so that I can\nscarcely write.” (So, at least, she pretended, and a little of that\nemotion must have been sincere, or she would not have been anxious to\nenlarge and emphasise it.) So Swann had been pleasing to her then. Our\nhands do not tremble except for ourselves, or for those whom we love. When\nthey have ceased to control our happiness how peaceful, how easy, how bold\ndo we become in their presence! In speaking to him, in writing to him now,\nshe no longer employed those words by which she had sought to give herself\nthe illusion that he belonged to her, creating opportunities for saying\n“my” and “mine” when she referred to him: “You are all that I have in the\nworld; it is the perfume of our friendship, I shall keep it,” nor spoke to\nhim of the future, of death itself, as of a single adventure which they\nwould have to share.  In those early days, whatever he might say to her,\nshe would answer admiringly: “You know, you will never be like other\npeople!\"–she would gaze at his long, slightly bald head, of which people\nwho know only of his successes used to think: “He’s not regularly\ngood-looking, if you like, but he is smart; that tuft, that eyeglass, that\nsmile!” and, with more curiosity perhaps to know him as he really was than\ndesire to become his mistress, she would sigh:",
        "“I do wish I could find out what there is in that head of yours!”",
        "But, now, whatever he might say, she would answer, in a tone sometimes of\nirritation, sometimes indulgent: “Ah! so you never will be like other\npeople!”",
        "She would gaze at his head, which was hardly aged at all by his recent\nanxieties (though people now thought of it, by the same mental process\nwhich enables one to discover the meaning of a piece of symphonic music of\nwhich one has read the programme, or the ’likenesses’ in a child whose\nfamily one has known: “He’s not positively ugly, if you like, but he is\nreally rather absurd; that eyeglass, that tuft, that smile!” realising in\ntheir imagination, fed by suggestion, the invisible boundary which\ndivides, at a few months’ interval, the head of an ardent lover from a\ncuckold’s), and would say:",
        "“Oh, I do wish I could change you; put some sense into that head of\nyours.”",
        "Always ready to believe in the truth of what he hoped, if it was only\nOdette’s way of behaving to him that left room for doubt, he would fling\nhimself greedily upon her words: “You can if you like,” he would tell her.",
        "And he tried to explain to her that to comfort him, to control him, to\nmake him work would be a noble task, to which numbers of other women asked\nfor nothing better than to be allowed to devote themselves, though it is\nonly fair to add that in those other women’s hands the noble task would\nhave seemed to Swann nothing more than an indiscreet and intolerable\nusurpation of his freedom of action. “If she didn’t love me, just a\nlittle,” he told himself, “she would not wish to have me altered. To alter\nme, she will have to see me more often.” And so he was able to trace, in\nthese faults which she found in him, a proof at least of her interest,\nperhaps even of her love; and, in fact, she gave him so little, now, of\nthe last, that he was obliged to regard as proofs of her interest in him\nthe various things which, every now and then, she forbade him to do. One\nday she announced that she did not care for his coachman, who, she\nthought, was perhaps setting Swann against her, and, anyhow, did not shew\nthat promptness and deference to Swann’s orders which she would have liked\nto see. She felt that he wanted to hear her say: “Don’t have him again\nwhen you come to me,” just as he might have wanted her to kiss him. So,\nbeing in a good temper, she said it; and he was deeply moved. That\nevening, when talking to M. de Charlus, with whom he had the satisfaction\nof being able to speak of her openly (for the most trivial remarks that he\nuttered now, even to people who had never heard of her, had always some\nsort of reference to Odette), he said to him:",
        "“I believe, all the same, that she loves me; she is so nice to me now, and\nshe certainly takes an interest in what I do.”",
        "And if, when he was starting off for her house, getting into his carriage\nwith a friend whom he was to drop somewhere on the way, his friend said:\n“Hullo! that isn’t Loredan on the box?” with what melancholy joy would\nSwann answer him:",
        "“Oh! Good heavens, no! I can tell you, I daren’t take Loredan when I go to\nthe Rue La Pérouse; Odette doesn’t like me to have Loredan, she thinks he\ndoesn’t suit me. What on earth is one to do? Women, you know, women. My\ndear fellow, she would be furious. Oh, lord, yes; I’ve only to take Rémi\nthere; I should never hear the last of it!”",
        "These new manners, indifferent, listless, irritable, which Odette now\nadopted with Swann, undoubtedly made him suffer; but he did not realise\nhow much he suffered; since it had been with a regular progression, day\nafter day, that Odette had chilled towards him, it was only by directly\ncontrasting what she was to-day with what she had been at first that he\ncould have measured the extent of the change that had taken place. Now\nthis change was his deep, his secret wound, which pained him day and\nnight, and whenever he felt that his thoughts were straying too near it,\nhe would quickly turn them into another channel for fear of being made to\nsuffer too keenly. He might say to himself in a vague way: “There was a\ntime when Odette loved me more,” but he never formed any definite picture\nof that time. Just as he had in his study a cupboard at which he contrived\nnever to look, which he turned aside to avoid passing whenever he entered\nor left the room, because in one of its drawers he had locked away the\nchrysanthemum which she had given him on one of those first evenings when\nhe had taken her home in his carriage, and the letters in which she said:\n“Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have\nthat back,” and “At whatever hour of the day or night you may need me,\njust send me a word, and dispose of me as you please,” so there was a\nplace in his heart to which he would never allow his thoughts to trespass\ntoo near, forcing them, if need be, to evade it by a long course of\nreasoning so that they should not have to pass within reach of it; the\nplace in which lingered his memories of happy days.",
        "But his so meticulous prudence was defeated one evening when he had gone\nout to a party.",
        "It was at the Marquise de Saint-Euverte’s, on the last, for that season,\nof the evenings on which she invited people to listen to the musicians who\nwould serve, later on, for her charity concerts. Swann, who had intended\nto go to each of the previous evenings in turn, but had never been able to\nmake up his mind, received, while he was dressing for this party, a visit\nfrom the Baron de Charlus, who came with an offer to go with him to the\nMarquise’s, if his company could be of any use in helping Swann not to\nfeel quite so bored when he got there, to be a little less unhappy. But\nSwann had thanked him with:",
        "“You can’t conceive how glad I should be of your company. But the greatest\npleasure that you can give me will be if you will go instead to see\nOdette. You know what a splendid influence you have over her. I don’t\nsuppose she’ll be going anywhere this evening, unless she goes to see her\nold dressmaker, and I’m sure she would be delighted if you went with her\nthere. In any case, you’ll find her at home before then. Try to keep her\namused, and also to give her a little sound advice. If you could arrange\nsomething for to-morrow which would please her, something that we could\nall three do together. Try to put out a feeler, too, for the summer; see\nif there’s anything she wants to do, a cruise that we might all three\ntake; anything you can think of. I don’t count upon seeing her to-night,\nmyself; still if she would like me to come, or if you find a loophole,\nyou’ve only to send me a line at Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s up till midnight;\nafter that I shall be here. Ever so many thanks for all you are doing for\nme–you know what I feel about you!”",
        "His friend promised to go and do as Swann wished as soon as he had\ndeposited him at the door of the Saint-Euverte house, where he arrived\nsoothed by the thought that M. de Charlus would be spending the evening in\nthe Rue La Pérouse, but in a state of melancholy indifference to\neverything that did not involve Odette, and in particular to the details\nof fashionable life, a state which invested them with the charm that is to\nbe found in anything which, being no longer an object of our desire,\nappears to us in its own guise. On alighting from his carriage, in the\nforeground of that fictitious summary of their domestic existence which\nhostesses are pleased to offer to their guests on ceremonial occasions,\nand in which they shew a great regard for accuracy of costume and setting,\nSwann was amused to discover the heirs and successors of Balzac’s\n’tigers’–now ’grooms’–.  who normally followed their mistress when she\nwalked abroad, but now, hatted and booted, were posted out of doors, in\nfront of the house on the gravelled drive, or outside the stables, as\ngardeners might be drawn up for inspection at the ends of their several\nflower-beds. The peculiar tendency which he had always had to look for\nanalogies between living people and the portraits in galleries reasserted\nitself here, but in a more positive and more general form; it was society\nas a whole, now that he was detached from it, which presented itself to\nhim in a series of pictures. In the cloak-room, into which, in the old\ndays, when he was still a man of fashion, he would have gone in his\novercoat, to emerge from it in evening dress, but without any impression\nof what had occurred there, his mind having been, during the minute or two\nthat he had spent in it, either still at the party which he had just left,\nor already at the party into which he was just about to be ushered, he now\nnoticed, for the first time, roused by the unexpected arrival of so\nbelated a guest, the scattered pack of splendid effortless animals, the\nenormous footmen who were drowsing here and there upon benches and chests,\nuntil, pointing their noble greyhound profiles, they towered upon their\nfeet and gathered in a circle round about him.",
        "One of them, of a particularly ferocious aspect, and not unlike the\nheadsman in certain Renaissance pictures which represent executions,\ntortures, and the like, advanced upon him with an implacable air to take\nhis ’things.’ But the harshness of his steely glare was compensated by the\nsoftness of his cotton gloves, so effectively that, as he approached\nSwann, he seemed to be exhibiting at once an utter contempt for his person\nand the most tender regard for his hat. He took it with a care to which\nthe precision of his movements imparted something that was almost\nover-fastidious, and with a delicacy that was rendered almost touching by\nthe evidence of his splendid strength. Then he passed it to one of his\nsatellites, a novice and timid, who was expressing the panic that\noverpowered him by casting furious glances in every direction, and\ndisplayed all the dumb agitation of a wild animal in the first hours of\nits captivity.",
        "A few feet away, a strapping great lad in livery stood musing, motionless,\nstatuesque, useless, like that purely decorative warrior whom one sees in\nthe most tumultuous of Mantegna’s paintings, lost in dreams, leaning upon\nhis shield, while all around him are fighting and bloodshed and death;\ndetached from the group of his companions who were thronging about Swann,\nhe seemed as determined to remain unconcerned in the scene, which he\nfollowed vaguely with his cruel, greenish eyes, as if it had been the\nMassacre of the Innocents or the Martyrdom of Saint James. He seemed\nprecisely to have sprung from that vanished race–if, indeed, it ever\nexisted, save in the reredos of San Zeno and the frescoes of the\nEremitani, where Swann had come in contact with it, and where it still\ndreams–fruit of the impregnation of a classical statue by some one of the\nMaster’s Paduan models, or of Albert Duerer’s Saxons. And the locks of his\nreddish hair, crinkled by nature, but glued to his head by brilliantine,\nwere treated broadly as they are in that Greek sculpture which the\nMantuan painter never ceased to study, and which, if in its creator’s\npurpose it represents but man, manages at least to extract from man’s\nsimple outlines such a variety of richness, borrowed, as it were, from the\nwhole of animated nature, that a head of hair, by the glossy undulation\nand beak-like points of its curls, or in the overlaying of the florid\ntriple diadem of its brushed tresses, can suggest at once a bunch of\nseaweed, a brood of fledgling doves, a bed of hyacinths and a serpent’s\nwrithing back. Others again, no less colossal, were disposed upon the\nsteps of a monumental staircase which, by their decorative presence and\nmarmorean immobility, was made worthy to be named, like that god-crowned\nascent in the Palace of the Doges, the ’Staircase of the Giants,’ and on\nwhich Swann now set foot, saddened by the thought that Odette had never\nclimbed it. Ah, with what joy would he, on the other hand, have raced up\nthe dark, evil-smelling, breakneck flights to the little dressmaker’s, in\nwhose attic he would so gladly have paid the price of a weekly stage-box\nat the Opera for the right to spend the evening there when Odette came,\nand other days too, for the privilege of talking about her, of living\namong people whom she was in the habit of seeing when he was not there,\nand who, on that account, seemed to keep secret among themselves some part\nof the life of his mistress more real, more inaccessible and more\nmysterious than anything that he knew. Whereas upon that pestilential,\nenviable staircase to the old dressmaker’s, since there was no other, no\nservice stair in the building, one saw in the evening outside every door\nan empty, unwashed milk-can set out, in readiness for the morning round,\nupon the door-mat; on the despicable, enormous staircase which Swann was\nat that moment climbing, on either side of him, at different levels,\nbefore each anfractuosity made in its walls by the window of the porter’s\nlodge or the entrance to a set of rooms, representing the departments of\nindoor service which they controlled, and doing homage for them to the\nguests, a gate-keeper, a major-domo, a steward (worthy men who spent the\nrest of the week in semi-independence in their own domains, dined there by\nthemselves like small shopkeepers, and might to-morrow lapse to the\nplebeian service of some successful doctor or industrial magnate),\nscrupulous in carrying out to the letter all the instructions that had\nbeen heaped upon them before they were allowed to don the brilliant livery\nwhich they wore only at long intervals, and in which they did not feel\naltogether at their ease, stood each in the arcade of his doorway, their\nsplendid pomp tempered by a democratic good-fellowship, like saints in\ntheir niches, and a gigantic usher, dressed Swiss Guard fashion, like the\nbeadle in a church, struck the pavement with his staff as each fresh\narrival passed him. Coming to the top of the staircase, up which he had\nbeen followed by a servant with a pallid countenance and a small pigtail\nclubbed at the back of his head, like one of Goya’s sacristans or a\ntabellion in an old play, Swann passed by an office in which the lackeys,\nseated like notaries before their massive registers, rose solemnly to\ntheir feet and inscribed his name. He next crossed a little hall\nwhich–just as certain rooms are arranged by their owners to serve as the\nsetting for a single work of art (from which they take their name), and,\nin their studied bareness, contain nothing else besides–displayed to him\nas he entered it, like some priceless effigy by Benvenuto Cellini of an\narmed watchman, a young footman, his body slightly bent forward, rearing\nabove his crimson gorget an even more crimson face, from which seemed to\nburst forth torrents of fire, timidity and zeal, who, as he pierced the\nAubusson tapestries that screened the door of the room in which the music\nwas being given with his impetuous, vigilant, desperate gaze, appeared,\nwith a soldierly impassibility or a supernatural faith–an allegory of\nalarums, incarnation of alertness, commemoration of a riot–to be looking\nout, angel or sentinel, from the tower of dungeon or cathedral, for the\napproach of the enemy or for the hour of Judgment.  Swann had now only to\nenter the concert-room, the doors of which were thrown open to him by an\nusher loaded with chains, who bowed low before him as though tendering to\nhim the keys of a conquered city.  But he thought of the house in which at\nthat very moment he might have been, if Odette had but permitted, and the\nremembered glimpse of an empty milk-can upon a door-mat wrung his heart.",
        "He speedily recovered his sense of the general ugliness of the human male\nwhen, on the other side of the tapestry curtain, the spectacle of the\nservants gave place to that of the guests. But even this ugliness of\nfaces, which of course were mostly familiar to him, seemed something new\nand uncanny, now that their features,–instead of being to him symbols of\npractical utility in the identification of this or that man, who until\nthen had represented merely so many pleasures to be sought after, boredoms\nto be avoided, or courtesies to be acknowledged–were at rest, measurable\nby aesthetic co-ordinates alone, in the autonomy of their curves and\nangles.  And in these men, in the thick of whom Swann now found himself\npacked, there was nothing (even to the monocle which many of them wore,\nand which, previously, would, at the most, have enabled Swann to say that\nso-and-so wore a monocle) which, no longer restricted to the general\nconnotation of a habit, the same in all of them, did not now strike him\nwith a sense of individuality in each. Perhaps because he did not regard\nGeneral de Froberville and the Marquis de Bréaute, who were talking\ntogether just inside the door, as anything more than two figures in a\npicture, whereas they were the old and useful friends who had put him up\nfor the Jockey Club and had supported him in duels, the General’s monocle,\nstuck like a shell-splinter in his common, scarred, victorious,\noverbearing face, in the middle of a forehead which it left half-blinded,\nlike the single-eyed flashing front of the Cyclops, appeared to Swann as a\nmonstrous wound which it might have been glorious to receive but which it\nwas certainly not decent to expose, while that which M. de Bréaute wore,\nas a festive badge, with his pearl-grey gloves, his crush hat and white\ntie, substituting it for the familiar pair of glasses (as Swann himself\ndid) when he went out to places, bore, glued to its other side, like a\nspecimen prepared on a slide for the microscope, an infinitesimal gaze\nthat swarmed with friendly feeling and never ceased to twinkle at the\nloftiness of ceilings, the delightfulness of parties, the interestingness\nof programmes and the excellence of refreshments.",
        "“Hallo! you here! why, it’s ages since I’ve seen you,” the General greeted\nSwann and, noticing the look of strain on his face and concluding that it\nwas perhaps a serious illness that had kept him away, went on, “You’re\nlooking well, old man!” while M. de Bréauté turned with, “My dear fellow,\nwhat on earth are you doing here?” to a ’society novelist’ who had just\nfitted into the angle of eyebrow and cheek his own monocle, the sole\ninstrument that he used in his psychological investigations and\nremorseless analyses of character, and who now replied, with an air of\nmystery and importance, rolling the ’r’:–\"I am observing!”",
        "The Marquis de Forestelle’s monocle was minute and rimless, and, by\nenforcing an incessant and painful contraction of the eye over which it\nwas incrusted like a superfluous cartilage, the presence of which there\nwas inexplicable and its substance unimaginable, it gave to his face a\nmelancholy refinement, and led women to suppose him capable of suffering\nterribly when in love. But that of M. de Saint-Candé, girdled, like\nSaturn, with an enormous ring, was the centre of gravity of a face which\ncomposed itself afresh every moment in relation to the glass, while his\nthrusting red nose and swollen sarcastic lips endeavoured by their\ngrimaces to rise to the level of the steady flame of wit that sparkled in\nthe polished disk, and saw itself preferred to the most ravishing eyes in\nthe world by the smart, depraved young women whom it set dreaming of\nartificial charms and a refinement of sensual bliss; and then, behind him,\nM. de Palancy, who with his huge carp’s head and goggling eyes moved\nslowly up and down the stream of festive gatherings, unlocking his great\nmandibles at every moment as though in search of his orientation, had the\nair of carrying about upon his person only an accidental and perhaps\npurely symbolical fragment of the glass wall of his aquarium, a part\nintended to suggest the whole which recalled to Swann, a fervent admirer\nof Giotto’s Vices and Virtues at Padua, that Injustice by whose side a\nleafy bough evokes the idea of the forests that enshroud his secret lair.",
        "Swann had gone forward into the room, under pressure from Mme. de\nSaint-Euverte and in order to listen to an aria from Orfeo which was\nbeing rendered on the flute, and had taken up a position in a corner from\nwhich, unfortunately, his horizon was bounded by two ladies of ’uncertain’\nage, seated side by side, the Marquise de Cambremer and the Vicomtesse de\nFranquetot, who, because they were cousins, used to spend their time at\nparties in wandering through the rooms, each clutching her bag and\nfollowed by her daughter, hunting for one another like people at a railway\nstation, and could never be at rest until they had reserved, by marking\nthem with their fans or handkerchiefs, two adjacent chairs; Mme. de\nCambremer, since she knew scarcely anyone, being all the more glad of a\ncompanion, while Mme. de Franquetot, who, on the contrary, was extremely\npopular, thought it effective and original to shew all her fine friends\nthat she preferred to their company that of an obscure country cousin with\nwhom she had childish memories in common. Filled with ironical melancholy,\nSwann watched them as they listened to the pianoforte inter, mezzo\n(Liszt’s ’Saint Francis preaching to the birds’) which came after the\nflute, and followed the virtuoso in his dizzy flight; Mme. de Franquetot\nanxiously, her eyes starting from her head, as though the keys over which\nhis fingers skipped with such agility were a series of trapezes, from any\none of which he might come crashing, a hundred feet, to the ground,\nstealing now and then a glance of astonishment and unbelief at her\ncompanion, as who should say: “It isn’t possible, I would never have\nbelieved that a human being could do all that!\"; Mme. de Cambremer, as a\nwoman who had received a sound musical education, beating time with her\nhead–transformed for the nonce into the pendulum of a metronome, the\nsweep and rapidity of whose movements from one shoulder to the other\n(performed with that look of wild abandonment in her eye which a sufferer\nshews who is no longer able to analyse his pain, nor anxious to master it,\nand says merely “I can’t help it”) so increased that at every moment her\ndiamond earrings caught in the trimming of her bodice, and she was obliged\nto put straight the bunch of black grapes which she had in her hair,\nthough without any interruption of her constantly accelerated motion. On\nthe other side (and a little way in front) of Mme. de Franquetot, was the\nMarquise de Gallardon, absorbed in her favourite meditation, namely upon\nher own kinship with the Guermantes family, from which she derived both\npublicly and in private a good deal of glory no unmingled with shame, the\nmost brilliant ornaments of that house remaining somewhat aloof from her,\nperhaps because she was just a tiresome old woman, or because she was a\nscandalous old woman, or because she came of an inferior branch of the\nfamily, or very possibly for no reason at all. When she found herself\nseated next to some one whom she did not know, as she was at this moment\nnext to Mme. de Franquetot, she suffered acutely from the feeling that her\nown consciousness of her Guermantes connection could not be made\nexternally manifest in visible character like those which, in the\nmosaics in Byzantine churches, placed one beneath another, inscribe in a\nvertical column by the side of some Sacred Personage the words which he is\nsupposed to be uttering. At this moment she was pondering the fact that\nshe had never received an invitation, or even call, from her young cousin\nthe Princesse des Laumes, during the six years that had already elapsed\nsince the latter’s marriage. The thought filled her with anger–and with\npride; for, by virtue of having told everyone who expressed surprise at\nnever seeing her at Mme. des Laumes’s, that it was because of the risk of\nmeeting the Princesse Mathilde there–a degradation which her own family,\nthe truest and bluest of Legitimists, would never have forgiven her, she\nhad come gradually to believe that this actually was the reason for her\nnot visiting her young cousin. She remembered, it is true, that she had\nseveral times inquired of Mme. des Laumes how they might contrive to meet,\nbut she remembered it only in a confused way, and besides did more than\nneutralise this slightly humiliating reminiscence by murmuring, “After\nall, it isn’t for me to take the first step; I am at least twenty years\nolder than she is.” And fortified by these unspoken words she flung her\nshoulders proudly back until they seemed to part company with her bust,\nwhile her head, which lay almost horizontally upon them, made one think of\nthe ’stuck-on’ head of a pheasant which is brought to the table regally\nadorned with its feathers. Not that she in the least degree resembled a\npheasant, having been endowed by nature with a short and squat and\nmasculine figure; but successive mortifications had given her a backward\ntilt, such as one may observe in trees which have taken root on the very\nedge of a precipice and are forced to grow backwards to preserve their\nbalance. Since she was obliged, in order to console herself for not being\nquite on a level with the rest of the Guermantes, to repeat to herself\nincessantly that it was owing to the uncompromising rigidity of her\nprinciples and pride that she saw so little of them, the constant\niteration had gradually remoulded her body, and had given her a sort of\n’bearing’ which was accepted by the plebeian as a sign of breeding, and\neven kindled, at times, a momentary spark in the jaded eyes of old\ngentlemen in clubs. Had anyone subjected Mme. de Gallardon’s conversation\nto that form of analysis which by noting the relative frequency of its\nseveral terms would furnish him with the key to a ciphered message, he\nwould at once have remarked that no expression, not even the commonest\nforms of speech, occurred in it nearly so often as “at my cousins the\nGuermantes’s,” “at my aunt Guermantes’s,” “Elzéar de Guermantes’s health,\"\n“my cousin Guermantes’s box.” If anyone spoke to her of a distinguished\npersonage, she would reply that, although she was not personally\nacquainted with him, she had seen him hundreds of times at her aunt\nGuermantes’s, but she would utter this reply in so icy a tone, with such a\nhollow sound, that it was at once quite clear that if she did not know the\ncelebrity personally that was because of all the obstinate, ineradicable\nprinciples against which her arching shoulders were stretched back to\nrest, as on one of those ladders on which gymnastic instructors make us\n’extend’ so as to develop the expansion of our chests.",
        "At this moment the Princesse des Laumes, who had not been expected to\nappear at Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s that evening, did in fact arrive.  To\nshew that she did not wish any special attention, in a house to which she\nhad come by an act of condescension, to be paid to her superior rank, she\nhad entered the room with her arms pressed close to her sides, even when\nthere was no crowd to be squeezed through, no one attempting to get past\nher; staying purposely at the back, with the air of being in her proper\nplace, like a king who stands in the waiting procession at the doors of a\ntheatre where the management have not been warned of his coming; and\nstrictly limiting her field of vision–so as not to seem to be advertising\nher presence and claiming the consideration that was her due–to the study\nof a pattern in the carpet or of her own skirt, she stood there on the\nspot which had struck her as the most modest (and from which, as she very\nwell knew, a cry of rapture from Mme. de Saint-Euverte would extricate her\nas soon as her presence there was noticed), next to Mme. de Cambremer,\nwhom, however, she did not know. She observed the dumb-show by which her\nneighbour was expressing her passion for music, but she refrained from\ncopying it. This was not to say that, for once that she had consented to\nspend a few minutes in Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s house, the Princesse des\nLaumes would not have wished (so that the act of politeness to her hostess\nwhich she had performed by coming might, so to speak, ’count double’) to\nshew herself as friendly and obliging as possible. But she had a natural\nhorror of what she called ’exaggerating,’ and always made a point of\nletting people see that she ’simply must not’ indulge in any display of\nemotion that was not in keeping with the tone of the circle in which she\nmoved, although such displays never failed to make an impression upon her,\nby virtue of that spirit of imitation, akin to timidity, which is\ndeveloped in the most self-confident persons, by contact with an\nunfamiliar environment, even though it be inferior to their own. She began\nto ask herself whether these gesticulations might not, perhaps, be a\nnecessary concomitant of the piece of music that was being played, a piece\nwhich, it might be, was in a different category from all the music that\nshe had ever heard before; and whether to abstain from them was not a sign\nof her own inability to understand the music, and of discourtesy towards\nthe lady of the house; with the result that, in order to express by a\ncompromise both of her contradictory inclinations in turn, at one moment\nshe would merely straighten her shoulder-straps or feel in her golden hair\nfor the little balls of coral or of pink enamel, frosted with tiny\ndiamonds, which formed its simple but effective ornament, studying, with a\ncold interest, her impassioned neighbour, while at another she would beat\ntime for a few bars with her fan, but, so as not to forfeit her\nindependence, she would beat a different time from the pianist’s. When he\nhad finished the Liszt Intermezzo and had begun a Prelude by Chopin, Mme.\nde Cambremer turned to Mme. de Franquetot with a tender smile, full of\nintimate reminiscence, as well as of satisfaction (that of a competent\njudge) with the performance. She had been taught in her girlhood to fondle\nand cherish those long-necked, sinuous creatures, the phrases of Chopin,\nso free, so flexible, so tactile, which begin by seeking their ultimate\nresting-place somewhere beyond and far wide of the direction in which they\nstarted, the point which one might have expected them to reach, phrases\nwhich divert themselves in those fantastic bypaths only to return more\ndeliberately–with a more premeditated reaction, with more precision, as\non a crystal bowl which, if you strike it, will ring and throb until you\ncry aloud in anguish–to clutch at one’s heart.",
        "Brought up in a provincial household with few friends or visitors, hardly\never invited to a ball, she had fuddled her mind, in the solitude of her\nold manor-house, over setting the pace, now crawling-slow, now passionate,\nwhirling, breathless, for all those imaginary waltzing couples, gathering\nthem like flowers, leaving the ball-room for a moment to listen, where the\nwind sighed among the pine-trees, on the shore of the lake, and seeing of\na sudden advancing towards her, more different from anything one had ever\ndreamed of than earthly lovers are, a slender young man, whose voice was\nresonant and strange and false, in white gloves. But nowadays the\nold-fashioned beauty of this music seemed to have become a trifle stale.\nHaving forfeited, some years back, the esteem of ’really musical’ people,\nit had lost its distinction and its charm, and even those whose taste was\nfrankly bad had ceased to find in it more than a moderate pleasure to\nwhich they hardly liked to confess. Mme. de Cambremer cast a furtive\nglance behind her. She knew that her young daughter-in-law (full of\nrespect for her new and noble family, except in such matters as related to\nthe intellect, upon which, having ’got as far’ as Harmony and the Greek\nalphabet, she was specially enlightened) despised Chopin, and fell quite\nill when she heard him played. But finding herself free from the scrutiny\nof this Wagnerian, who was sitting, at some distance, in a group of her\nown contemporaries, Mme. de Cambremer let herself drift upon a stream of\nexquisite memories and sensations. The Princesse des Laumes was touched\nalso. Though without any natural gift for music, she had received, some\nfifteen years earlier, the instruction which a music-mistress of the\nFaubourg Saint-Germain, a woman of genius who had been, towards the end of\nher life, reduced to penury, had started, at seventy, to give to the\ndaughters and granddaughters of her old pupils. This lady was now dead.\nBut her method, an echo of her charming touch, came to life now and then\nin the fingers of her pupils, even of those who had been in other respects\nquite mediocre, had given up music, and hardly ever opened a piano. And so\nMme. des Laumes could let her head sway to and fro, fully aware of the\ncause, with a perfect appreciation of the manner in which the pianist was\nrendering this Prelude, since she knew it by heart. The closing notes of\nthe phrase that he had begun sounded already on her lips.  And she\nmurmured “How charming it is!” with a stress on the opening consonants of\nthe adjective, a token of her refinement by which she felt her lips so\nromantically compressed, like the petals of a beautiful, budding flower,\nthat she instinctively brought her eyes into harmony, illuminating them\nfor a moment with a vague and sentimental gaze. Meanwhile Mme.  de\nGallardon had arrived at the point of saying to herself how annoying it\nwas that she had so few opportunities of meeting the Princesse des Laumes,\nfor she meant to teach her a lesson by not acknowledging her bow. She did\nnot know that her cousin was in the room. A movement of Mme. Franquetot’s\nhead disclosed the Princess. At once Mme. de Gallardon dashed towards her,\nupsetting all her neighbours; although determined to preserve a distant\nand glacial manner which should remind everyone present that she had no\ndesire to remain on friendly terms with a person in whose house one might\nfind oneself, any day, cheek by jowl with the Princesse Mathilde, and to\nwhom it was not her duty to make advances since she was not ’of her\ngeneration,’ she felt bound to modify this air of dignity and reserve by\nsome non-committal remark which would justify her overture and would force\nthe Princess to engage in conversation; and so, when she reached her\ncousin, Mme. de Gallardon, with a stern countenance and one hand thrust\nout as though she were trying to ’force’ a card, began with: “How is your\nhusband?” in the same anxious tone that she would have used if the Prince\nhad been seriously ill. The Princess, breaking into a laugh which was one\nof her characteristics, and was intended at once to shew the rest of an\nassembly that she was making fun of some one and also to enhance her own\nbeauty by concentrating her features around her animated lips and\nsparkling eyes, answered: “Why; he’s never been better in his life!” And\nshe went on laughing.",
        "Mme. de Gallardon then drew herself up and, chilling her expression still\nfurther, perhaps because she was still uneasy about the Prince’s health,\nsaid to her cousin:",
        "“Oriane,” (at once Mme. des Laumes looked with amused astonishment towards\nan invisible third, whom she seemed to call to witness that she had never\nauthorised Mme. de Gallardon to use her Christian name) “I should be so\npleased if you would look in, just for a minute, to-morrow evening, to\nhear a quintet, with the clarinet, by Mozart. I should like to have your\nopinion of it.”",
        "She seemed not so much to be issuing an invitation as to be asking favour,\nand to want the Princess’s opinion of the Mozart quintet just though it\nhad been a dish invented by a new cook, whose talent it was most important\nthat an epicure should come to judge.",
        "“But I know that quintet quite well. I can tell you now–that I adore it.”",
        "“You know, my husband isn’t at all well; it’s his liver. He would like so\nmuch to see you,” Mme. de Gallardon resumed, making it now a corporal work\nof charity for the Princess to appear at her party.",
        "The Princess never liked to tell people that she would not go to their\nhouses. Every day she would write to express her regret at having been\nkept away–by the sudden arrival of her husband’s mother, by an invitation\nfrom his brother, by the Opera, by some excursion to the country–from\nsome party to which she had never for a moment dreamed of going.  In this\nway she gave many people the satisfaction of feeling that she was on\nintimate terms with them, that she would gladly have come to their houses,\nand that she had been prevented from doing so only by some princely\noccurrence which they were flattered to find competing with their own\nhumble entertainment. And then, as she belonged to that witty ’Guermantes\nset’–in which there survived something of the alert mentality, stripped\nof all commonplace phrases and conventional sentiments, which dated from\nMérimée, and found its final expression in the plays of Meilhac and\nHalévy–she adapted its formula so as to suit even her social engagements,\ntransposed it into the courtesy which was always struggling to be positive\nand precise, to approximate itself to the plain truth. She would never\ndevelop at any length to a hostess the expression of her anxiety to be\npresent at her party; she found it more pleasant to disclose to her all\nthe various little incidents on which it would depend whether it was or\nwas not possible for her to come.",
        "“Listen, and I’ll explain,” she began to Mme. de Gallardon. “To-morrow\nevening I must go to a friend of mine, who has been pestering me to fix a\nday for ages. If she takes us to the theatre afterwards, then I can’t\npossibly come to you, much as I should love to; but if we just stay in the\nhouse, I know there won’t be anyone else there, so I can slip away.”",
        "“Tell me, have you seen your friend M. Swann?”",
        "“No! my precious Charles! I never knew he was here. Where is he? I must\ncatch his eye.”",
        "“It’s a funny thing that he should come to old Saint-Euverte’s,” Mme.  de\nGallardon went on. “Oh, I know he’s very clever,” meaning by that ’very\ncunning,’ “but that makes no difference; fancy a Jew here, and she the\nsister and sister-in-law of two Archbishops.”",
        "“I am ashamed to confess that I am not in the least shocked,” said the\nPrincesse des Laumes.",
        "“I know he’s a converted Jew, and all that, and his parents and\ngrandparents before him. But they do say that the converted ones are worse\nabout their religion than the practising ones, that it’s all just a\npretence; is that true, d’you think?”",
        "“I can throw no light at all on the matter.”",
        "The pianist, who was ’down’ to play two pieces by Chopin, after finishing\nthe Prelude had at once attacked a Polonaise. But once Mme. de Gallardon\nhad informed her cousin that Swann was in the room, Chopin himself might\nhave risen from the grave and played all his works in turn without Mme.\ndes Laumes’s paying him the slightest attention. She belonged to that one\nof the two divisions of the human race in which the untiring curiosity\nwhich the other half feels about the people whom it does not know is\nreplaced by an unfailing interest in the people whom it does. As with many\nwomen of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, the presence, in any room in which\nshe might find herself, of another member of her set, even although she\nhad nothing in particular to say to him, would occupy her mind to the\nexclusion of every other consideration. From that moment, in the hope that\nSwann would catch sight of her, the Princess could do nothing but (like a\ntame white mouse when a lump of sugar is put down before its nose and then\ntaken away) turn her face, in which were crowded a thousand signs of\nintimate connivance, none of them with the least relevance to the\nsentiment underlying Chopin’s music, in the direction where Swann was,\nand, if he moved, divert accordingly the course of her magnetic smile.",
        "“Oriane, don’t be angry with me,” resumed Mme. de Gallardon, who could\nnever restrain herself from sacrificing her highest social ambitions, and\nthe hope that she might one day emerge into a light that would dazzle the\nworld, to the immediate and secret satisfaction of saying something\ndisagreeable, “people do say about your M. Swann that he’s the sort of man\none can’t have in the house; is that true?”",
        "“Why, you, of all people, ought to know that it’s true,” replied the\nPrincesse des Laumes, “for you must have asked him a hundred times, and\nhe’s never been to your house once.”",
        "And leaving her cousin mortified afresh, she broke out again into a laugh\nwhich scandalised everyone who was trying to listen to the music, but\nattracted the attention of Mme. de Saint-Euverte, who had stayed, out of\npoliteness, near the piano, and caught sight of the Princess now for the\nfirst time. Mme. de Saint-Euverte was all the more delighted to see Mme.\ndes Laumes, as she imagined her to be still at Guermantes, looking after\nher father-in-law, who was ill.",
        "“My dear Princess, you here?”",
        "“Yes, I tucked myself away in a corner, and I’ve been hearing such lovely\nthings.”",
        "“What, you’ve been in the room quite a time?”",
        "“Oh, yes, quite a long time, which seemed very short; it was only long\nbecause I couldn’t see you.”",
        "Mme. de Saint-Euverte offered her own chair to the Princess, who declined\nit with:",
        "“Oh, please, no! Why should you? It doesn’t matter in the least where\nI sit.” And deliberately picking out, so as the better to display the\nsimplicity of a really great lady, a low seat without a back: “There now,\nthat hassock, that’s all I want. It will make me keep my back straight.\nOh!  Good heavens, I’m making a noise again; they’ll be telling you to\nhave me ’chucked out’.”",
        "Meanwhile, the pianist having doubled his speed, the emotion of the\nmusic-lovers was reaching its climax, a servant was handing refreshments\nabout on a salver, and was making the spoons rattle, and, as on every\nother ’party-night’, Mme. de Saint-Euverte was making signs to him, which\nhe never saw, to leave the room. A recent bride, who had been told that a\nyoung woman ought never to appear bored, was smiling vigorously, trying to\ncatch her hostess’s eye so as to flash a token of her gratitude for the\nother’s having ’thought of her’ in connection with so delightful an\nentertainment. And yet, although she remained more calm than Mme. de\nFranquetot, it was not without some uneasiness that she followed the\nflying fingers; what alarmed her being not the pianist’s fate but the\npiano’s, on which a lighted candle, jumping at each fortissimo,\nthreatened, if not to set its shade on fire, at least to spill wax upon\nthe ebony. At last she could contain herself no longer, and, running up\nthe two steps of the platform on which the piano stood, flung herself on\nthe candle to adjust its sconce. But scarcely had her hand come within\nreach of it when, on a final chord, the piece finished, and the pianist\nrose to his feet. Nevertheless the bold initiative shewn by this young\nwoman and the moment of blushing confusion between her and the pianist\nwhich resulted from it, produced an impression that was favourable on the\nwhole.",
        "“Did you see what that girl did just now, Princess?” asked General de\nFroberville, who had come up to Mme. des Laumes as her hostess left her\nfor a moment. “Odd, wasn’t it? Is she one of the performers?”",
        "“No, she’s a little Mme. de Cambremer,” replied the Princess carelessly,\nand then, with more animation: “I am only repeating what I heard just now,\nmyself; I haven’t the faintest notion who said it, it was some one behind\nme who said that they were neighbours of Mme. de Saint-Euverte in the\ncountry, but I don’t believe anyone knows them, really. They must be\n’country cousins’! By the way, I don’t know whether you’re particularly\n’well-up’ in the brilliant society which we see before us, because I’ve no\nidea who all these astonishing people can be. What do you suppose they do\nwith themselves when they’re not at Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s parties? She\nmust have ordered them in with the musicians and the chairs and the food.\n’Universal providers,’ you know. You must admit, they’re rather splendid,\nGeneral. But can she really have the courage to hire the same ’supers’\nevery week? It isn’t possible!”",
        "“Oh, but Cambremer is quite a good name; old, too,” protested the General.",
        "“I see no objection to its being old,” the Princess answered dryly, “but\nwhatever else it is it’s not euphonious,” she went on, isolating the word\neuphonious as though between inverted commas, a little affectation to\nwhich the Guermantes set were addicted.",
        "“You think not, eh! She’s a regular little peach, though,” said the\nGeneral, whose eyes never strayed from Mme. de Cambremer. “Don’t you agree\nwith me, Princess?”",
        "“She thrusts herself forward too much; I think, in so young a woman,\nthat’s not very nice–for I don’t suppose she’s my generation,” replied\nMme. des Laumes (the last word being common, it appeared, to Gallardon and\nGuermantes). And then, seeing that M. de Froberville was still gazing at\nMme. de Cambremer, she added, half out of malice towards the lady, half\nwishing to oblige the General: “Not very nice... for her husband!  I am\nsorry that I do not know her, since she seems to attract you so much; I\nmight have introduced you to her,” said the Princess, who, if she had\nknown the young woman, would most probably have done nothing of the sort.\n“And now I must say good night, because one of my friends is having a\nbirthday party, and I must go and wish her many happy returns,” she\nexplained, modestly and with truth, reducing the fashionable gathering to\nwhich she was going to the simple proportions of a ceremony which would be\nboring in the extreme, but at which she was obliged to be present, and\nthere would be something touching about her appearance. “Besides, I must\npick up Basin. While I’ve been here, he’s gone to see those friends of\nhis–you know them too, I’m sure,–who are called after a bridge–oh, yes,\nthe Iénas.”",
        "“It was a battle before it was a bridge, Princess; it was a victory!” said\nthe General. “I mean to say, to an old soldier like me,” he went on,\nwiping his monocle and replacing it, as though he were laying a fresh\ndressing on the raw wound underneath, while the Princess instinctively\nlooked away, “that Empire nobility, well, of course, it’s not the same\nthing, but, after all, taking it as it is, it’s very fine of its kind;\nthey were people who really did fight like heroes.”",
        "“But I have the deepest respect for heroes,” the Princess assented, though\nwith a faint trace of irony. “If I don’t go with Basin to see this\nPrincesse d’Iéna, it isn’t for that, at all; it’s simply because I don’t\nknow them. Basin knows them; he worships them. Oh, no, it’s not what you\nthink; he’s not in love with her. I’ve nothing to set my face against!\nBesides, what good has it ever done when I have set my face against them?\"\nshe queried sadly, for the whole world knew that, ever since the day upon\nwhich the Prince des Laumes had married his fascinating cousin, he had\nbeen consistently unfaithful to her. “Anyhow, it isn’t that at all.\nThey’re people he has known for ever so long, they do him very well, and\nthat suits me down to the ground. But I must tell you what he’s told me\nabout their house; it’s quite enough. Can you imagine it, all their\nfurniture is ’Empire’!”",
        "“But, my dear Princess, that’s only natural; it belonged to their\ngrandparents.”",
        "“I don’t quite say it didn’t, but that doesn’t make it any less ugly. I\nquite understand that people can’t always have nice things, but at least\nthey needn’t have things that are merely grotesque. What do you say? I can\nthink of nothing more devastating, more utterly smug than that hideous\nstyle–cabinets covered all over with swans’ heads, like bath-taps!”",
        "“But I believe, all the same, that they’ve got some lovely things; why,\nthey must have that famous mosaic table on which the Treaty of...”",
        "“Oh, I don’t deny, they may have things that are interesting enough from\nthe historic point of view. But things like that can’t, ever, be beautiful\n... because they’re simply horrible! I’ve got things like that myself,\nthat came to Basin from the Montesquious. Only, they’re up in the attics\nat Guermantes, where nobody ever sees them. But, after all, that’s not the\npoint, I would fly to see them, with Basin; I would even go to see them\namong all their sphinxes and brasses, if I knew them, but–I don’t know\nthem! D’you know, I was always taught, when I was a little girl, that it\nwas not polite to call on people one didn’t know.” She assumed a tone of\nchildish gravity. “And so I am just doing what I was taught to do.  Can’t\nyou see those good people, with a totally strange woman bursting into\ntheir house? Why, I might get a most hostile reception.”",
        "And she coquettishly enhanced the charm of the smile which the idea had\nbrought to her lips, by giving to her blue eyes, which were fixed on the\nGeneral, a gentle, dreamy expression.",
        "“My dear Princess, you know that they’d be simply wild with joy.”",
        "“No, why?” she inquired, with the utmost vivacity, either so as to seem\nunaware that it would be because she was one of the first ladies in\nFrance, or so as to have the pleasure of hearing the General tell her so.\n“Why?  How can you tell? Perhaps they would think it the most unpleasant\nthing that could possibly happen. I know nothing about them, but if\nthey’re anything like me, I find it quite boring enough to see the people\nI do know; I’m sure if I had to see people I didn’t know as well, even if\nthey had ’fought like heroes,’ I should go stark mad. Besides, except when\nit’s an old friend like you, whom one knows quite apart from that, I’m not\nsure that ’heroism’ takes one very far in society. It’s often quite boring\nenough to have to give a dinner-party, but if one had to offer one’s arm\nto Spartacus, to let him take one down...! Really, no; it would never be\nVercingetorix I should send for, to make a fourteenth. I feel sure, I\nshould keep him for really big ’crushes.’ And as I never give any...”",
        "“Ah! Princess, it’s easy to see you’re not a Guermantes for nothing.  You\nhave your share of it, all right, the ’wit of the Guermantes’!”",
        "“But people always talk about the wit of the Guermantes; I never could\nmake out why. Do you really know any others who have it?” she rallied him,\nwith a rippling flow of laughter, her features concentrated, yoked to the\nservice of her animation, her eyes sparkling, blazing with a radiant\nsunshine of gaiety which could be kindled only by such speeches–even if\nthe Princess had to make them herself–as were in praise of h wit or of\nher beauty. “Look, there’s Swann talking to your Cambremer woman; over\nthere, beside old Saint-Euverte, don’t you see him? Ask him to introduce\nyou. But hurry up, he seems to be just going!”",
        "“Did you notice how dreadfully ill he’s looking?” asked the General.",
        "“My precious Charles? Ah, he’s coming at last; I was beginning to think he\ndidn’t want to see me!”",
        "Swann was extremely fond of the Princesse des Laumes, and the sight of her\nrecalled to him Guermantes, a property close to Combray, and all that\ncountry which he so dearly loved and had ceased to visit, so as not to be\nseparated from Odette. Slipping into the manner, half-artistic,\nhalf-amorous–with which he could always manage to amuse the Princess–a\nmanner which came to him quite naturally whenever he dipped for a moment\ninto the old social atmosphere, and wishing also to express in words, for\nhis own satisfaction, the longing that he felt for the country:",
        "“Ah!” he exclaimed, or rather intoned, in such a way as to be audible at\nonce to Mme. de Saint-Euverte, to whom he spoke, and to Mme. des Laumes,\nfor whom he was speaking, “Behold our charming Princess! See, she has come\nup on purpose from Guermantes to hear Saint Francis preach to the birds,\nand has only just had time, like a dear little tit-mouse, to go and pick a\nfew little hips and haws and put them in her hair; there are even some\ndrops of dew upon them still, a little of the hoar-frost which must be\nmaking the Duchess, down there, shiver. It is very pretty indeed, my dear\nPrincess.”",
        "“What! The Princess came up on purpose from Guermantes? But that’s too\nwonderful! I never knew; I’m quite bewildered,” Mme. de Saint-Euverte\nprotested with quaint simplicity, being but little accustomed to Swann’s\nway of speaking. And then, examining the Princess’s headdress, “Why,\nyou’re quite right; it is copied from... what shall I say, not chestnuts,\nno,–oh, it’s a delightful idea, but how can the Princess have known what\nwas going to be on my programme? The musicians didn’t tell me, even.”",
        "Swann, who was accustomed, when he was with a woman whom he had kept up\nthe habit of addressing in terms of gallantry, to pay her delicate\ncompliments which most other people would not and need not understand, did\nnot condescend to explain to Mme. de Saint-Euverte that he had been\nspeaking metaphorically. As for the Princess, she was in fits of laughter,\nboth because Swann’s wit was highly appreciated by her set, and because\nshe could never hear a compliment addressed to herself without finding it\nexquisitely subtle and irresistibly amusing.",
        "“Indeed! I’m delighted, Charles, if my little hips and haws meet with your\napproval. But tell me, why did you bow to that Cambremer person, are you\nalso her neighbour in the country?”",
        "Mme. de Saint-Euverte, seeing that the Princess seemed quite happy talking\nto Swann, had drifted away.",
        "“But you are, yourself, Princess!”",
        "“I! Why, they must have ’countries’ everywhere, those creatures! Don’t I\nwish I had!”",
        "“No, not the Cambremers; her own people. She was a Legrandin, and used to\ncome to Combray. I don’t know whether you are aware that you are Comtesse\nde Combray, and that the Chapter owes you a due.”",
        "“I don’t know what the Chapter owes me, but I do know that I’m ’touched’\nfor a hundred francs, every year, by the Curé, which is a due that I could\nvery well do without. But surely these Cambremers have rather a startling\nname. It ends just in time, but it ends badly!” she said with a laugh.",
        "“It begins no better.” Swann took the point.",
        "“Yes; that double abbreviation!”",
        "“Some one very angry and very proper who didn’t dare to finish the first\nword.”",
        "“But since he couldn’t stop himself beginning the second, he’d have done\nbetter to finish the first and be done with it. We are indulging in the\nmost refined form of humour, my dear Charles, in the very best of\ntaste–but how tiresome it is that I never see you now,” she went on in a\ncoaxing tone, “I do so love talking to you. Just imagine, I could not make\nthat idiot Froberville see that there was anything funny about the name\nCambremer.  Do agree that life is a dreadful business. It’s only when I\nsee you that I stop feeling bored.”",
        "Which was probably not true. But Swann and the Princess had the same way\nof looking at the little things of life–the effect, if not the cause of\nwhich was a close analogy between their modes of expression and even of\npronunciation. This similarity was not striking because no two things\ncould have been more unlike than their voices. But if one took the trouble\nto imagine Swann’s utterances divested of the sonority that enwrapped\nthem, of the moustache from under which they emerged, one found that they\nwere the same phrases, the same inflexions, that they had the ’tone’ of\nthe Guermantes set. On important matters, Swann and the Princess had not\nan idea in common. But since Swann had become so melancholy, and was\nalways in that trembling condition which precedes a flood of tears, he had\nthe same need to speak about his grief that a murderer has to tell some\none about his crime. And when he heard the Princess say that life was a\ndreadful business, he felt as much comforted as if she had spoken to him\nof Odette.",
        "“Yes, life is a dreadful business! We must meet more often, my dear\nfriend. What is so nice about you is that you are not cheerful. We could\nspend a most pleasant evening together.”",
        "“I’m sure we could; why not come down to Guermantes? My mother-in-law\nwould be wild with joy. It’s supposed to be very ugly down there, but I\nmust say, I find the neighborhood not at all unattractive; I have a horror\nof ’picturesque spots’.”",
        "“I know it well, it’s delightful!” replied Swann. “It’s almost too\nbeautiful, too much alive for me just at present; it’s a country to be\nhappy in. It’s perhaps because I have lived there, but things there speak\nto me so. As soon as a breath of wind gets up, and the cornfields begin to\nstir, I feel that some one is going to appear suddenly, that I am going to\nhear some news; and those little houses by the water’s edge... I should be\nquite wretched!”",
        "“Oh! my dearest Charles, do take care; there’s that appalling Rampillon\nwoman; she’s seen me; hide me somewhere, do tell me again, quickly, what\nit was that happened to her; I get so mixed up; she’s just married off her\ndaughter, or her lover (I never can remember),–perhaps both–to each\nother! Oh, no, I remember now, she’s been dropped by her Prince... Pretend\nto be talking, so that the poor old Berenice sha’n’t come and invite me to\ndinner. Anyhow, I’m going. Listen, my dearest Charles, now that I have\nseen you, once in a blue moon, won’t you let me carry you off and take you\nto the Princesse de Parme’s, who would be so pleased to see you (you\nknow), and Basin too, for that matter; he’s meeting me there. If one\ndidn’t get news of you, sometimes, from Mémé...  Remember, I never see you\nat all now!”",
        "Swann declined. Having told M. de Charlus that, on leaving Mme. de\nSaint-Euverte’s, he would go straight home, he did not care to run the\nrisk, by going on now to the Princesse de Parme’s, of missing a message\nwhich he had, all the time, been hoping to see brought in to him by one of\nthe footmen, during the party, and which he was perhaps going to find left\nwith his own porter, at home.",
        "“Poor Swann,” said Mme. des Laumes that night to her husband; “he is\nalways charming, but he does look so dreadfully unhappy. You will see for\nyourself, for he has promised to dine with us one of these days. I do feel\nthat it’s really absurd that a man of his intelligence should let himself\nbe made to suffer by a creature of that kind, who isn’t even interesting,\nfor they tell me, she’s an absolute idiot!” she concluded with the wisdom\ninvariably shewn by people who, not being in love themselves, feel that a\nclever man ought to be unhappy only about such persons as are worth his\nwhile; which is rather like being astonished that anyone should condescend\nto die of cholera at the bidding of so insignificant a creature as the\ncommon bacillus.",
        "Swann now wished to go home, but, just as he was making his escape,\nGeneral de Froberville caught him and asked for an introduction to Mme.\nde Cambremer, and he was obliged to go back into the room to look for her.",
        "“I say, Swann, I’d rather be married to that little woman than killed by\nsavages, what do you say?”",
        "The words ’killed by savages’ pierced Swann’s aching heart; and at once he\nfelt the need of continuing the conversation. “Ah!” he began, “some fine\nlives have been lost in that way... There was, you remember, that explorer\nwhose remains Dumont d’Urville brought back, La Pérouse...” (and he was at\nonce happy again, as though he had named Odette). “He was a fine\ncharacter, and interests me very much, does La Pérouse,” he ended sadly.",
        "“Oh, yes, of course, La Pérouse,” said the General. “It’s quite a\nwell-known name. There’s a street called that.”",
        "“Do you know anyone in the Rue La Pérouse?” asked Swann excitedly.",
        "“Only Mme. de Chanlivault, the sister of that good fellow Chaussepierre.\nShe gave a most amusing theatre-party the other evening. That’s a house\nthat will be really smart some day, you’ll see!”",
        "“Oh, so she lives in the Rue La Pérouse. It’s attractive; I like that\nstreet; it’s so sombre.”",
        "“Indeed it isn’t. You can’t have been in it for a long time; it’s not at\nall sombre now; they’re beginning to build all round there.”",
        "When Swann did finally introduce M. de Froberville to the young Mme.  de\nCambremer, since it was the first time that she had heard the General’s\nname, she hastily outlined upon her lips the smile of joy and surprise\nwith which she would have greeted him if she had never, in the whole of\nher life, heard anything else; for, as she did not yet know all the\nfriends of her new family, whenever anyone was presented to her, she\nassumed that he must be one of them, and thinking that she would shew her\ntact by appearing to have heard ’such a lot about him’ since her marriage,\nshe would hold out her hand with an air of hesitation which was meant as a\nproof at once of the inculcated reserve which she had to overcome and of\nthe spontaneous friendliness which successfully overcame it. And so her\nparents-in-law, whom she still regarded as the most eminent pair in\nFrance, declared that she was an angel; all the more that they preferred\nto appear, in marrying her to their son, to have yielded to the attraction\nrather of her natural charm than of her considerable fortune.",
        "“It’s easy to see that you’re a musician heart and soul, Madame,” said the\nGeneral, alluding to the incident of the candle.",
        "Meanwhile the concert had begun again, and Swann saw that he could not now\ngo before the end of the new number. He suffered greatly from being shut\nup among all these people whose stupidity and absurdities wounded him all\nthe more cruelly since, being ignorant of his love, incapable, had they\nknown of it, of taking any interest, or of doing more than smile at it as\nat some childish joke, or deplore it as an act of insanity, they made it\nappear to him in the aspect of a subjective state which existed for\nhimself alone, whose reality there was nothing external to confirm; he\nsuffered overwhelmingly, to the point at which even the sound of the\ninstruments made him want to cry, from having to prolong his exile in this\nplace to which Odette would never come, in which no one, nothing was aware\nof her existence, from which she was entirely absent.",
        "But suddenly it was as though she had entered, and this apparition tore\nhim with such anguish that his hand rose impulsively to his heart. What\nhad happened was that the violin had risen to a series of high notes, on\nwhich it rested as though expecting something, an expectancy which it\nprolonged without ceasing to hold on to the notes, in the exaltation with\nwhich it already saw the expected object approaching, and with a desperate\neffort to continue until its arrival, to welcome it before itself expired,\nto keep the way open for a moment longer, with all its remaining strength,\nthat the stranger might enter in, as one holds a door open that would\notherwise automatically close. And before Swann had had time to understand\nwhat was happening, to think: “It is the little phrase from Vinteuil’s\nsonata. I mustn’t listen!”, all his memories of the days when Odette had\nbeen in love with him, which he had succeeded, up till that evening, in\nkeeping invisible in the depths of his being, deceived by this sudden\nreflection of a season of love, whose sun, they supposed, had dawned\nagain, had awakened from their slumber, had taken wing and risen to sing\nmaddeningly in his ears, without pity for his present desolation, the\nforgotten strains of happiness.",
        "In place of the abstract expressions “the time when I was happy,” “the\ntime when I was loved,” which he had often used until then, and without\nmuch suffering, for his intelligence had not embodied in them anything of\nthe past save fictitious extracts which preserved none of the reality, he\nnow recovered everything that had fixed unalterably the peculiar, volatile\nessence of that lost happiness; he could see it all; the snowy, curled\npetals of the chrysanthemum which she had tossed after him into his\ncarriage, which he had kept pressed to his lips, the address ’Maison\nDorée,’ embossed on the note-paper on which he had read “My hand trembles\nso as I write to you,” the frowning contraction of her eyebrows when she\nsaid pleadingly: “You won’t let it be very long before you send for me?\";\nhe could smell the heated iron of the barber whom he used to have in to\nsinge his hair while Loredan went to fetch the little working girl; could\nfeel the torrents of rain which fell so often that spring, the ice-cold\nhomeward drive in his victoria, by moonlight; all the network of mental\nhabits, of seasonable impressions, of sensory reactions, which had\nextended over a series of weeks its uniform meshes, by which his body now\nfound itself inextricably held. At that time he had been satisfying a\nsensual curiosity to know what were the pleasures of those people who\nlived for love alone.  He had supposed that he could stop there, that he\nwould not be obliged to learn their sorrows also; how small a thing the\nactual charm of Odette was now in comparison with that formidable terror\nwhich extended it like a cloudy halo all around her, that enormous anguish\nof not knowing at every hour of the day and night what she had been doing,\nof not possessing her wholly, at all times and in all places! Alas, he\nrecalled the accents in which she had exclaimed: “But I can see you at any\ntime; I am always free!\"–she, who was never free now; the interest, the\ncuriosity that she had shewn in his life, her passionate desire that he\nshould do her the favour–of which it was he who, then, had felt\nsuspicious, as of a possibly tedious waste of his time and disturbance of\nhis arrangements–of granting her access to his study; how she had been\nobliged to beg that he would let her take him to the Verdurins’; and, when\nhe did allow her to come to him once a month, how she had first, before he\nwould let himself be swayed, had to repeat what a joy it would be to her,\nthat custom of their seeing each other daily, for which she had longed at\na time when to him it had seemed only a tiresome distraction, for which,\nsince that time, she had conceived a distaste and had definitely broken\nherself of it, while it had become for him so insatiable, so dolorous a\nneed. Little had he suspected how truly he spoke when, on their third\nmeeting, as she repeated: “But why don’t you let me come to you oftener?\"\nhe had told her, laughing, and in a vein of gallantry, that it was for\nfear of forming a hopeless passion.  Now, alas, it still happened at times\nthat she wrote to him from a restaurant or hotel, on paper which bore a\nprinted address, but printed in letters of fire that seared his heart.\n“Written from the Hôtel Vouillemont.  What on earth can she have gone\nthere for? With whom? What happened there?” He remembered the gas-jets\nthat were being extinguished along the Boulevard des Italiens when he had\nmet her, when all hope was gone among the errant shades upon that night\nwhich had seemed to him almost supernatural and which now (that night of a\nperiod when he had not even to ask himself whether he would be annoying\nher by looking for her and by finding her, so certain was he that she knew\nno greater happiness than to see him and to let him take her home)\nbelonged indeed to a mysterious world to which one never may return again\nonce its doors are closed. And Swann could distinguish, standing,\nmotionless, before that scene of happiness in which it lived again, a\nwretched figure which filled him with such pity, because he did not at\nfirst recognise who it was, that he must lower his head, lest anyone\nshould observe that his eyes were filled with tears.  It was himself.",
        "When he had realised this, his pity ceased; he was jealous, now, of that\nother self whom she had loved, he was jealous of those men of whom he had\nso often said, without much suffering: “Perhaps she’s in love with them,\"\nnow that he had exchanged the vague idea of loving, in which there is no\nlove, for the petals of the chrysanthemum and the ’letter-heading’ of the\nMaison d’Or; for they were full of love. And then, his anguish becoming\ntoo keen, he passed his hand over his forehead, let the monocle drop from\nhis eye, and wiped its glass. And doubtless, if he had caught sight of\nhimself at that moment, he would have added to the collection of the\nmonocles which he had already identified, this one which he removed, like\nan importunate, worrying thought, from his head, while from its misty\nsurface, with his handkerchief, he sought to obliterate his cares.",
        "There are in the music of the violin–if one does not see the instrument\nitself, and so cannot relate what one hears to its form, which modifies\nthe fullness of the sound–accents which are so closely akin to those of\ncertain contralto voices, that one has the illusion that a singer has\ntaken her place amid the orchestra. One raises one’s eyes; one sees only\nthe wooden case, magical as a Chinese box; but, at moments, one is still\ntricked by the deceiving appeal of the Siren; at times, too, one believes\nthat one is listening to a captive spirit, struggling in the darkness of\nits masterful box, a box quivering with enchantment, like a devil immersed\nin a stoup of holy water; sometimes, again, it is in the air, at large,\nlike a pure and supernatural creature that reveals to the ear, as it\npasses, its invisible message.",
        "As though the musicians were not nearly so much playing the little phrase\nas performing the rites on which it insisted before it would consent to\nappear, as proceeding to utter the incantations necessary to procure, and\nto prolong for a few moments, the miracle of its apparition, Swann, who\nwas no more able now to see it than if it had belonged to a world of\nultra-violet light, who experienced something like the refreshing sense of\na metamorphosis in the momentary blindness with which he had been struck\nas he approached it, Swann felt that it was present, like a protective\ngoddess, a confidant of his love, who, so as to be able to come to him\nthrough the crowd, and to draw him aside to speak to him, had disguised\nherself in this sweeping cloak of sound. And as she passed him, light,\nsoothing, as softly murmured as the perfume of a flower, telling him what\nshe had to say, every word of which he closely scanned, sorry to see them\nfly away so fast, he made involuntarily with his lips the motion of\nkissing, as it went by him, the harmonious, fleeting form.",
        "He felt that he was no longer in exile and alone since she, who addressed\nherself to him, spoke to him in a whisper of Odette. For he had no longer,\nas of old, the impression that Odette and he were not known to the little\nphrase. Had it not often been the witness of their joys? True that, as\noften, it had warned him of their frailty. And indeed, whereas, in that\ndistant time, he had divined an element of suffering in its smile, in its\nlimpid and disillusioned intonation, to-night he found there rather the\ncharm of a resignation that was almost gay. Of those sorrows, of which the\nlittle phrase had spoken to him then, which he had seen it–without his\nbeing touched by them himself–carry past him, smiling, on its sinuous and\nrapid course, of those sorrows which were now become his own, without his\nhaving any hope of being, ever, delivered from them, it seemed to say to\nhim, as once it had said of his happiness: “What does all that matter; it\nis all nothing.” And Swann’s thoughts were borne for the first time on a\nwave of pity and tenderness towards that Vinteuil, towards that unknown,\nexalted brother who also must have suffered so greatly; what could his\nlife have been? From the depths of what well of sorrow could he have drawn\nthat god-like strength, that unlimited power of creation?",
        "When it was the little phrase that spoke to him of the vanity of his\nsufferings, Swann found a sweetness in that very wisdom which, but a\nlittle while back, had seemed to him intolerable when he thought that he\ncould read it on the faces of indifferent strangers, who would regard his\nlove as a digression that was without importance. ’Twas because the little\nphrase, unlike them, whatever opinion it might hold on the short duration\nof these states of the soul, saw in them something not, as everyone else\nsaw, less serious than the events of everyday life, but, on the contrary,\nso far superior to everyday life as to be alone worthy of the trouble of\nexpressing it. Those graces of an intimate sorrow, ’twas them that the\nphrase endeavoured to imitate, to create anew; and even their essence, for\nall that it consists in being incommunicable and in appearing trivial to\neveryone save him who has experience of them, the little phrase had\ncaptured, had rendered visible. So much so that it made their value be\nconfessed, their divine sweetness be tasted by all those same\nonlookers–provided only that they were in any sense musical–who, the\nnext moment, would ignore, would disown them in real life, in every\nindividual love that came into being beneath their eyes. Doubtless the\nform in which it had codified those graces could not be analysed into any\nlogical elements. But ever since, more than a year before, discovering to\nhim many of the riches of his own soul, the love of music had been born,\nand for a time at least had dwelt in him, Swann had regarded musical\nmotifs as actual ideas, of another world, of another order, ideas veiled\nin shadows, unknown, impenetrable by the human mind, which none the less\nwere perfectly distinct one from another, unequal among themselves in\nvalue and in significance. When, after that first evening at the\nVerdurins’, he had had the little phrase played over to him again, and had\nsought to disentangle from his confused impressions how it was that, like\na perfume or a caress, it swept over and enveloped him, he had observed\nthat it was to the closeness of the intervals between the five notes which\ncomposed it and to the constant repetition of two of them that was due\nthat impression of a frigid, a contracted sweetness; but in reality he\nknew that he was basing this conclusion not upon the phrase itself, but\nmerely upon certain equivalents, substituted (for his mind’s convenience)\nfor the mysterious entity of which he had become aware, before ever he\nknew the Verdurins, at that earlier party, when for the first time he had\nheard the sonata played. He knew that his memory of the piano falsified\nstill further the perspective in which he saw the music, that the field\nopen to the musician is not a miserable stave of seven notes, but an\nimmeasurable keyboard (still, almost all of it, unknown), on which, here\nand there only, separated by the gross darkness of its unexplored tracts,\nsome few among the millions of keys, keys of tenderness, of passion, of\ncourage, of serenity, which compose it, each one differing from all the\nrest as one universe differs from another, have been discovered by certain\ngreat artists who do us the service, when they awaken in us the emotion\ncorresponding to the theme which they have found, of shewing us what\nrichness, what variety lies hidden, unknown to us, in that great black\nimpenetrable night, discouraging exploration, of our soul, which we have\nbeen content to regard as valueless and waste and void. Vinteuil had been\none of those musicians. In his little phrase, albeit it presented to the\nmind’s eye a clouded surface, there was contained, one felt, a matter so\nconsistent, so explicit, to which the phrase gave so new, so original a\nforce, that those who had once heard it preserved the memory of it in the\ntreasure-chamber of their minds. Swann would repair to it as to a\nconception of love and happiness, of which at once he knew as well in what\nrespects it was peculiar as he would know of the Princesse de Clèves, or\nof René, should either of those titles occur to him. Even when he was\nnot thinking of the little phrase, it existed, latent, in his mind, in the\nsame way as certain other conceptions without material equivalent, such as\nour notions of light, of sound, of perspective, of bodily desire, the rich\npossessions wherewith our inner temple is diversified and adorned. Perhaps\nwe shall lose them, perhaps they will be obliterated, if we return to\nnothing in the dust. But so long as we are alive, we can no more bring\nourselves to a state in which we shall not have known them than we can\nwith regard to any material object, than we can, for example, doubt the\nluminosity of a lamp that has just been lighted, in view of the changed\naspect of everything in the room, from which has vanished even the memory\nof the darkness. In that way Vinteuil’s phrase, like some theme, say, in\nTristan, which represents to us also a certain acquisition of sentiment,\nhas espoused our mortal state, had endued a vesture of humanity that was\naffecting enough. Its destiny was linked, for the future, with that of the\nhuman soul, of which it was one of the special, the most distinctive\nornaments. Perhaps it is not-being that is the true state, and all our\ndream of life is without existence; but, if so, we feel that it must be\nthat these phrases of music, these conceptions which exist in relation to\nour dream, are nothing either. We shall perish, but we have for our\nhostages these divine captives who shall follow and share our fate. And\ndeath in their company is something less bitter, less inglorious, perhaps\neven less certain.",
        "So Swann was not mistaken in believing that the phrase of the sonata did,\nreally, exist. Human as it was from this point of view, it belonged, none\nthe less, to an order of supernatural creatures whom we have never seen,\nbut whom, in spite of that, we recognise and acclaim with rapture when\nsome explorer of the unseen contrives to coax one forth, to bring it down\nfrom that divine world to which he has access to shine for a brief moment\nin the firmament of ours. This was what Vinteuil had done for the little\nphrase. Swann felt that the composer had been content (with the musical\ninstruments at his disposal) to draw aside its veil, to make it visible,\nfollowing and respecting its outlines with a hand so loving, so prudent,\nso delicate and so sure, that the sound altered at every moment, blunting\nitself to indicate a shadow, springing back into life when it must follow\nthe curve of some more bold projection. And one proof that Swann was not\nmistaken when he believed in the real existence of this phrase, was that\nanyone with an ear at all delicate for music would at once have detected\nthe imposture had Vinteuil, endowed with less power to see and to render\nits forms, sought to dissemble (by adding a line, here and there, of his\nown invention) the dimness of his vision or the feebleness of his hand.",
        "The phrase had disappeared. Swann knew that it would come again at the end\nof the last movement, after a long passage which Mme. Verdurin’s pianist\nalways ’skipped.’ There were in this passage some admirable ideas which\nSwann had not distinguished on first hearing the sonata, and which he now\nperceived, as if they had, in the cloakroom of his memory, divested\nthemselves of their uniform disguise of novelty. Swann listened to all the\nscattered themes which entered into the composition of the phrase, as its\npremises enter into the inevitable conclusion of a syllogism; he was\nassisting at the mystery of its birth. “Audacity,” he exclaimed to\nhimself, “as inspired, perhaps, as a Lavoisier’s or an Ampere’s, the\naudacity of a Vinteuil making experiment, discovering the secret laws that\ngovern an unknown force, driving across a region unexplored towards the\none possible goal the invisible team in which he has placed his trust and\nwhich he never may discern!” How charming the dialogue which Swann now\nheard between piano and violin, at the beginning of the last passage. The\nsuppression of human speech, so far from letting fancy reign there\nuncontrolled (as one might have thought), had eliminated it altogether.\nNever was spoken language of such inflexible necessity, never had it known\nquestions so pertinent, such obvious replies. At first the piano\ncomplained alone, like a bird deserted by its mate; the violin heard and\nanswered it, as from a neighbouring tree. It was as at the first beginning\nof the world, as if there were not yet but these twain upon the earth, or\nrather in this world closed against all the rest, so fashioned by the\nlogic of its creator that in it there should never be any but themselves;\nthe world of this sonata. Was it a bird, was it the soul, not yet made\nperfect, of the little phrase, was it a fairy, invisibly somewhere\nlamenting, whose plaint the piano heard and tenderly repeated? Its cries\nwere so sudden that the violinist must snatch up his bow and race to catch\nthem as they came. Marvellous bird! The violinist seemed to wish to charm,\nto tame, to woo, to win it. Already it had passed into his soul, already\nthe little phrase which it evoked shook like a medium’s the body of the\nviolinist, ’possessed’ indeed.  Swann knew that the phrase was going to\nspeak to him once again.  And his personality was now so divided that the\nstrain of waiting for the imminent moment when he would find himself face\nto face, once more, with the phrase, convulsed him in one of those sobs\nwhich a fine line of poetry or a piece of alarming news will wring from\nus, not when we are alone, but when we repeat one or the other to a\nfriend, in whom we see ourselves reflected, like a third person, whose\nprobable emotion softens him.  It reappeared, but this time to remain\npoised in the air, and to sport there for a moment only, as though\nimmobile, and shortly to expire. And so Swann lost nothing of the precious\ntime for which it lingered. It was still there, like an iridescent bubble\nthat floats for a while unbroken. As a rainbow, when its brightness fades,\nseems to subside, then soars again and, before it is extinguished, is\nglorified with greater splendour than it has ever shewn; so to the two\ncolours which the phrase had hitherto allowed to appear it added others\nnow, chords shot with every hue in the prism, and made them sing. Swann\ndared not move, and would have liked to compel all the other people in the\nroom to remain still also, as if the slightest movement might embarrass\nthe magic presence, supernatural, delicious, frail, that would so easily\nvanish. But no one, as it happened, dreamed of speaking.  The ineffable\nutterance of one solitary man, absent, perhaps dead (Swann did not know\nwhether Vinteuil were still alive), breathed out above the rites of those\ntwo hierophants, sufficed to arrest the attention of three hundred minds,\nand made of that stage on which a soul was thus called into being one of\nthe noblest altars on which a supernatural ceremony could be performed. It\nfollowed that, when the phrase at last was finished, and only its\nfragmentary echoes floated among the subsequent themes which had already\ntaken its place, if Swann at first was annoyed to see the Comtesse de\nMonteriender, famed for her imbecilities, lean over towards him to confide\nin him her impressions, before even the sonata had come to an end; he\ncould not refrain from smiling, and perhaps also found an underlying\nsense, which she was incapable of perceiving, in the words that she used.\nDazzled by the virtuosity of the performers, the Comtesse exclaimed to\nSwann: “It’s astonishing! I have never seen anything to beat it...” But a\nscrupulous regard for accuracy making her correct her first assertion, she\nadded the reservation: “anything to beat it... since the table-turning!”",
        "From that evening, Swann understood that the feeling which Odette had once\nhad for him would never revive, that his hopes of happiness would not be\nrealised now. And the days on which, by a lucky chance, she had once more\nshewn herself kind and loving to him, or if she had paid him any\nattention, he recorded those apparent and misleading signs of a slight\nmovement on her part towards him with the same tender and sceptical\nsolicitude, the desperate joy that people reveal who, when they are\nnursing a friend in the last days of an incurable malady, relate, as\nsignificant facts of infinite value: “Yesterday he went through his\naccounts himself, and actually corrected a mistake that we had made in\nadding them up; he ate an egg to-day and seemed quite to enjoy it, if he\ndigests it properly we shall try him with a cutlet to-morrow,\"–although\nthey themselves know that these things are meaningless on the eve of an\ninevitable death. No doubt Swann was assured that if he had now been\nliving at a distance from Odette he would gradually have lost all interest\nin her, so that he would have been glad to learn that she was leaving\nParis for ever; he would have had the courage to remain there; but he had\nnot the courage to go.",
        "He had often thought of going. Now that he was once again at work upon his\nessay on Vermeer, he wanted to return, for a few days at least, to The\nHague, to Dresden, to Brunswick. He was certain that a ’Toilet of Diana’\nwhich had been acquired by the Mauritshuis at the Goldschmidt sale as a\nNicholas Maes was in reality a Vermeer. And he would have liked to be able\nto examine the picture on the spot, so as to strengthen his conviction.\nBut to leave Paris while Odette was there, and even when she was not\nthere–for in strange places where our sensations have not been numbed by\nhabit, we refresh, we revive an old pain–was for him so cruel a project\nthat he felt himself to be capable of entertaining it incessantly in his\nmind only because he knew himself to be resolute in his determination\nnever to put it into effect. But it would happen that, while he was\nasleep, the intention to travel would reawaken in him (without his\nremembering that this particular tour was impossible) and would be\nrealised. One night he dreamed that he was going away for a year; leaning\nfrom the window of the train towards a young man on the platform who wept\nas he bade him farewell, he was seeking to persuade this young man to come\naway also. The train began to move; he awoke in alarm, and remembered that\nhe was not going away, that he would see Odette that evening, and next day\nand almost every day. And then, being still deeply moved by his dream, he\nwould thank heaven for those special circumstances which made him\nindependent, thanks to which he could remain in Odette’s vicinity, and\ncould even succeed in making her allow him to see her sometimes; and,\ncounting over the list of his advantages: his social position–his\nfortune, from which she stood too often in need of assistance not to\nshrink from the prospect of a definite rupture (having even, so people\nsaid, an ulterior plan of getting him to marry her)–his friendship with\nM. de Charlus, which, it must be confessed, had never won him any very\ngreat favour from Odette, but which gave him the pleasant feeling that she\nwas always hearing complimentary things said about him by this common\nfriend for whom she had so great an esteem–and even his own intelligence,\nthe whole of which he employed in weaving, every day, a fresh plot which\nwould make his presence, if not agreeable, at any rate necessary to Odette\n–he thought of what might have happened to him if all these advantages\nhad been lacking, he thought that, if he had been, like so many other men,\npoor and humble, without resources, forced to undertake any task that\nmight be offered to him, or tied down by parents or by a wife, he might\nhave been obliged to part from Odette, that that dream, the terror of\nwhich was still so recent, might well have been true; and he said to\nhimself: “People don’t know when they are happy. They’re never so unhappy\nas they think they are.” But he reflected that this existence had lasted\nalready for several years, that all that he could now hope for was that it\nshould last for ever, that he would sacrifice his work, his pleasures, his\nfriends, in fact the whole of his life to the daily expectation of a\nmeeting which, when it occurred, would bring him no happiness; and he\nasked himself whether he was not mistaken, whether the circumstances that\nhad favoured their relations and had prevented a final rupture had not\ndone a disservice to his career, whether the outcome to be desired was not\nthat as to which he rejoiced that it happened only in dreams–his own\ndeparture; and he said to himself that people did not know when they were\nunhappy, that they were never so happy as they supposed.",
        "Sometimes he hoped that she would die, painlessly, in some accident, she\nwho was out of doors in the streets, crossing busy thoroughfares, from\nmorning to night. And as she always returned safe and sound, he marvelled\nat the strength, at the suppleness of the human body, which was able\ncontinually to hold in check, to outwit all the perils that environed it\n(which to Swann seemed innumerable, since his own secret desire had strewn\nthem in her path), and so allowed its occupant, the soul, to abandon\nitself, day after day, and almost with impunity, to its career of\nmendacity, to the pursuit of pleasure. And Swann felt a very cordial\nsympathy with that Mahomet II whose portrait by Bellini he admired, who,\non finding that he had fallen madly in love with one of his wives, stabbed\nher, in order, as his Venetian biographer artlessly relates, to recover\nhis spiritual freedom. Then he would be ashamed of thinking thus only of\nhimself, and his own sufferings would seem to deserve no pity now that he\nhimself was disposing so cheaply of Odette’s very life.",
        "Since he was unable to separate himself from her without a subsequent\nreturn, if at least he had seen her continuously and without separations\nhis grief would ultimately have been assuaged, and his love would,\nperhaps, have died. And from the moment when she did not wish to leave\nParis for ever he had hoped that she would never go. As he knew that her\none prolonged absence, every year, was in August and September, he had\nabundant opportunity, several months in advance, to dissociate from it the\ngrim picture of her absence throughout Eternity which was lodged in him by\nanticipation, and which, consisting of days closely akin to the days\nthrough which he was then passing, floated in a cold transparency in his\nmind, which it saddened and depressed, though without causing him any\nintolerable pain. But that conception of the future, that flowing stream,\ncolourless and unconfined, a single word from Odette sufficed to penetrate\nthrough all Swann’s defences, and like a block of ice immobilised it,\ncongealed its fluidity, made it freeze altogether; and Swann felt himself\nsuddenly filled with an enormous and unbreakable mass which pressed on the\ninner walls of his consciousness until he was fain to burst asunder; for\nOdette had said casually, watching him with a malicious smile:\n“Forcheville is going for a fine trip at Whitsuntide. He’s going to\nEgypt!” and Swann had at once understood that this meant: “I am going to\nEgypt at Whitsuntide with Forcheville.” And, in fact, if, a few days\nlater, Swann began: “About that trip that you told me you were going to\ntake with Forcheville,” she would answer carelessly: “Yes, my dear boy,\nwe’re starting on the 19th; we’ll send you a ’view’ of the Pyramids.” Then\nhe was determined to know whether she was Forcheville’s mistress, to ask\nher point-blank, to insist upon her telling him. He knew that there were\nsome perjuries which, being so superstitious, she would not commit, and\nbesides, the fear, which had hitherto restrained his curiosity, of making\nOdette angry if he questioned her, of making himself odious, had ceased to\nexist now that he had lost all hope of ever being loved by her.",
        "One day he received an anonymous letter which told him that Odette had\nbeen the mistress of countless men (several of whom it named, among them\nForcheville, M. de Bréauté and the painter) and women, and that she\nfrequented houses of ill-fame. He was tormented by the discovery that\nthere was to be numbered among his friends a creature capable of sending\nhim such a letter (for certain details betrayed in the writer a\nfamiliarity with his private life). He wondered who it could be. But he\nhad never had any suspicion with regard to the unknown actions of other\npeople, those which had no visible connection with what they said. And\nwhen he wanted to know whether it was rather beneath the apparent\ncharacter of M. de Charlus, or of M. des Laumes, or of M. d’Orsan that he\nmust place the untravelled region in which this ignoble action might have\nhad its birth; as none of these men had ever, in conversation with Swann,\nsuggested that he approved of anonymous letters, and as everything that\nthey had ever said to him implied that they strongly disapproved, he saw\nno further reason for associating this infamy with the character of any\none of them more than with the rest. M. de Charlus was somewhat inclined\nto eccentricity, but he was fundamentally good and kind; M. des Laumes was\na trifle dry, but wholesome and straight. As for M. d’Orsan, Swann had\nnever met anyone who, even in the most depressing circumstances, would\ncome to him with a more heartfelt utterance, would act more properly or\nwith more discretion. So much so that he was unable to understand the\nrather indelicate part commonly attributed to M. d’Orsan in his relations\nwith a certain wealthy woman, and that whenever he thought of him he was\nobliged to set that evil reputation on one side, as irreconcilable with so\nmany unmistakable proofs of his genuine sincerity and refinement.  For a\nmoment Swann felt that his mind was becoming clouded, and he thought of\nsomething else so as to recover a little light; until he had the courage\nto return to those other reflections. But then, after not having been able\nto suspect anyone, he was forced to suspect everyone that he knew.  After\nall, M. de Charlus might be most fond of him, might be most good-natured;\nbut he was a neuropath; to-morrow, perhaps, he would burst into tears on\nhearing that Swann was ill; and to-day, from jealousy, or in anger, or\ncarried away by some sudden idea, he might have wished to do him a\ndeliberate injury. Really, that kind of man was the worst of all. The\nPrince des Laumes was, certainly, far less devoted to Swann than was M. de\nCharlus. But for that very reason he had not the same susceptibility with\nregard to him; and besides, his was a nature which, though, no doubt, it\nwas cold, was as incapable of a base as of a magnanimous action. Swann\nregretted that he had formed no attachments in his life except to such\npeople. Then he reflected that what prevents men from doing harm to their\nneighbours is fellow-feeling, that he could not, in the last resort,\nanswer for any but men whose natures were analogous to his own, as was, so\nfar as the heart went, that of M. de Charlus. The mere thought of causing\nSwann so much distress would have been revolting to him. But with a man\nwho was insensible, of another order of humanity, as was the Prince des\nLaumes, how was one to foresee the actions to which he might be led by the\npromptings of a different nature? To have a good heart was everything, and\nM. de Charlus had one. But M. d’Orsan was not lacking in that either, and\nhis relations with Swann–cordial, but scarcely intimate, arising from the\npleasure which, as they held the same views about everything, they found\nin talking together–were more quiescent than the enthusiastic affection\nof M. de Charlus, who was apt to be led into passionate activity, good or\nevil. If there was anyone by whom Swann felt that he had always been\nunderstood, and (with delicacy) loved, it was M. d’Orsan. Yes, but the\nlife he led; it could hardly be called honourable. Swann regretted that he\nhad never taken any notice of those rumours, that he himself had admitted,\njestingly, that he had never felt so keen a sense of sympathy, or of\nrespect, as when he was in thoroughly ’detrimental’ society. “It is not\nfor nothing,” he now assured himself, “that when people pass judgment upon\ntheir neighbour, their finding is based upon his actions. It is those\nalone that are significant, and not at all what we say or what we think.\nCharlus and des Laumes may have this or that fault, but they are men of\nhonour. Orsan, perhaps, has not the same faults, but he is not a man of\nhonour. He may have acted dishonourably once again.” Then he suspected\nRémi, who, it was true, could only have inspired the letter, but he now\nfelt himself, for a moment, to be on the right track. To begin with,\nLoredan had his own reasons for wishing harm to Odette. And then, how were\nwe not to suppose that our servants, living in a situation inferior to our\nown, adding to our fortunes and to our frailties imaginary riches and\nvices for which they at once envied and despised us, should not find\nthemselves led by fate to act in a manner abhorrent to people of our own\nclass? He also suspected my grandfather. On every occasion when Swann had\nasked him to do him any service, had he not invariably declined? Besides,\nwith his ideas of middle-class respectability, he might have thought that\nhe was acting for Swann’s good. He suspected, in turn, Bergotte, the\npainter, the Verdurins; paused for a moment to admire once again the\nwisdom of people in society, who refused to mix in the artistic circles in\nwhich such things were possible, were, perhaps, even openly avowed, as\nexcellent jokes; but then he recalled the marks of honesty that were to be\nobserved in those Bohemians, and contrasted them with the life of\nexpedients, often bordering on fraudulence, to which the want of money,\nthe craving for luxury, the corrupting influence of their pleasures often\ndrove members of the aristocracy. In a word, this anonymous letter proved\nthat he himself knew a human being capable of the most infamous conduct,\nbut he could see no reason why that infamy should lurk in the\ndepths–which no strange eye might explore–of the warm heart rather than\nthe cold, the artist’s rather than the business-man’s, the noble’s rather\nthan the flunkey’s. What criterion ought one to adopt, in order to judge\none’s fellows? After all, there was not a single one of the people whom he\nknew who might not, in certain circumstances, prove capable of a shameful\naction. Must he then cease to see them all? His mind grew clouded; he\npassed his hands two or three times across his brow, wiped his glasses\nwith his handkerchief, and remembering that, after all, men who were as\ngood as himself frequented the society of M. de Charlus, the Prince des\nLaumes and the rest, he persuaded himself that this meant, if not that\nthey were incapable of shameful actions, at least that it was a necessity\nin human life, to which everyone must submit, to frequent the society of\npeople who were, perhaps, not incapable of such actions. And he continued\nto shake hands with all the friends whom he had suspected, with the purely\nformal reservation that each one of them had, possibly, been seeking to\ndrive him to despair. As for the actual contents of the letter, they did\nnot disturb him; for in not one of the charges which it formulated against\nOdette could he see the least vestige of fact. Like many other men, Swann\nhad a naturally lazy mind, and was slow in invention. He knew quite well\nas a general truth, that human life is full of contrasts, but in the case\nof any one human being he imagined all that part of his or her life with\nwhich he was not familiar as being identical with the part with which he\nwas. He imagined what was kept secret from him in the light of what was\nrevealed. At such times as he spent with Odette, if their conversation\nturned upon an indelicate act committed, or an indelicate sentiment\nexpressed by some third person, she would ruthlessly condemn the culprit\nby virtue of the same moral principles which Swann had always heard\nexpressed by his own parents, and to which he himself had remained loyal;\nand then, she would arrange her flowers, would sip her tea, would shew an\ninterest in his work. So Swann extended those habits to fill the rest of\nher life, he reconstructed those actions when he wished to form a picture\nof the moments in which he and she were apart. If anyone had portrayed her\nto him as she was, or rather as she had been for so long with himself, but\nhad substituted some other man, he would have been distressed, for such a\nportrait would have struck him as lifelike. But to suppose that she went\nto bad houses, that she abandoned herself to orgies with other women, that\nshe led the crapulous existence of the most abject, the most contemptible\nof mortals–would be an insane wandering of the mind, for the realisation\nof which, thank heaven, the chrysanthemums that he could imagine, the\ndaily cups of tea, the virtuous indignation left neither time nor place.\nOnly, now and again, he gave Odette to understand that people maliciously\nkept him informed of everything that she did; and making opportune use of\nsome detail–insignificant but true–which he had accidentally learned, as\nthough it were the sole fragment which he would allow, in spite of\nhimself, to pass his lips, out of the numberless other fragments of that\ncomplete reconstruction of her daily life which he carried secretly in his\nmind, he led her to suppose that he was perfectly informed upon matters,\nwhich, in reality, he neither knew nor suspected, for if he often adjured\nOdette never to swerve from or make alteration of the truth, that was\nonly, whether he realised it or no, in order that Odette should tell him\neverything that she did. No doubt, as he used to assure Odette, he loved\nsincerity, but only as he might love a pander who could keep him in touch\nwith the daily life of his mistress.  Moreover, his love of sincerity, not\nbeing disinterested, had not improved his character. The truth which he\ncherished was that which Odette would tell him; but he himself, in order\nto extract that truth from her, was not afraid to have recourse to\nfalsehood, that very falsehood which he never ceased to depict to Odette\nas leading every human creature down to utter degradation. In a word, he\nlied as much as did Odette, because, while more unhappy than she, he was\nno less egotistical. And she, when she heard him repeating thus to her the\nthings that she had done, would stare at him with a look of distrust and,\nat all hazards, of indignation, so as not to appear to be humiliated, and\nto be blushing for her actions. One day, after the longest period of calm\nthrough which he had yet been able to exist without being overtaken by an\nattack of jealousy, he had accepted an invitation to spend the evening at\nthe theatre with the Princesse des Laumes. Having opened his newspaper to\nfind out what was being played, the sight of the title–Les Filles de\nMarbre, by Théodore Barrière,–struck him so cruel a blow that he\nrecoiled instinctively from it and turned his head away. Illuminated, as\nthough by a row of footlights, in the new surroundings in which it now\nappeared, that word ’marble,’ which he had lost the power to distinguish,\nso often had it passed, in print, beneath his eyes, had suddenly become\nvisible once again, and had at once brought back to his mind the story\nwhich Odette had told him, long ago, of a visit which she had paid to the\nSalon at the Palais d’Industrie with Mme. Verdurin, who had said to her,\n“Take care, now! I know how to melt you, all right. You’re not made of\nmarble.” Odette had assured him that it was only a joke, and he had not\nattached any importance to it at the time. But he had had more confidence\nin her then than he had now.  And the anonymous letter referred explicitly\nto relations of that sort.
