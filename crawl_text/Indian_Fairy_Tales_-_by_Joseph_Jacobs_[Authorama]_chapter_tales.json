        "To My Dear Little Phil",
        "From the extreme West of the Indo-European world, we go this year to\nthe extreme East. From the soft rain and green turf of Gaeldom, we seek\nthe garish sun and arid soil of the Hindoo. In the Land of Ire, the\nbelief in fairies, gnomes, ogres and monsters is all but dead; in the\nLand of Ind it still flourishes in all the vigour of animism.",
        "Soils and national characters differ; but fairy tales are the same in\nplot and incidents, if not in treatment. The majority of the tales in\nthis volume have been known in the West in some form or other, and the\nproblem arises how to account for their simultaneous existence in\nfarthest West and East. Some–as Benfey in Germany, M. Cosquin in\nFrance, and Mr. Clouston in England–have declared that India is the\nHome of the Fairy Tale, and that all European fairy tales have been\nbrought from thence by Crusaders, by Mongol missionaries, by Gipsies,\nby Jews, by traders, by travellers. The question is still before the\ncourts, and one can only deal with it as an advocate. So far as my\ninstructions go, I should be prepared, within certain limits, to hold a\nbrief for India. So far as the children of Europe have their fairy\nstories in common, these–and they form more than a third of the whole\n–are derived from India. In particular, the majority of the Drolls or\ncomic tales and jingles can be traced, without much difficulty, back to\nthe Indian peninsula.",
        "Certainly there is abundant evidence of the early transmission by\nliterary means of a considerable number of drolls and folk-tales from\nIndia about the time of the Crusaders. The collections known in Europe\nby the titles of The Fables of Bidpai, The Seven Wise Masters, Gesia\nRomanorum, and Barlaam and Josaphat, were extremely popular\nduring the Middle Ages, and their contents passed on the one hand into\nthe Exempla of the monkish preachers, and on the other into the\nNovelle of Italy, thence, after many days, to contribute their\nquota to the Elizabethan Drama. Perhaps nearly one-tenth of the main\nincidents of European folktales can be traced to this source.",
        "There are even indications of an earlier literary contact between\nEurope and India, in the case of one branch of the folk-tale, the Fable\nor Beast Droll. In a somewhat elaborate discussion [Footnote: “History\nof the Aesopic Fable,” the introductory volume to my edition of Caxton’s\nFables of Esope (London, Nutt, 1889).] I have come to the\nconclusion that a goodly number of the fables that pass under the name\nof the Samian slave, Aesop, were derived from India, probably from the\nsame source whence the same tales were utilised in the Jatakas, or\nBirth-stories of Buddha. These Jatakas contain a large quantity of\ngenuine early Indian folk-tales, and form the earliest collection of\nfolk-tales in the world, a sort of Indian Grimm, collected more than\ntwo thousand years before the good German brothers went on their quest\namong the folk with such delightful results. For this reason I have\nincluded a considerable number of them in this volume; and shall be\nsurprised if tales that have roused the laughter and wonder of pious\nBuddhists for the last two thousand years, cannot produce the same\neffect on English children. The Jatakas have been fortunate in their\nEnglish translators, who render with vigour and point; and I rejoice\nin being able to publish the translation of two new Jatakas, kindly\ndone into English for this volume by Mr. W. H. D. Rouse, of Christ’s\nCollege, Cambridge. In one of these I think I have traced the source\nof the Tar Baby incident in “Uncle Remus.”",
        "Though Indian fairy tales are the earliest in existence, yet they are\nalso from another point of view the youngest. For it is only about\ntwenty-five years ago that Miss Frere began the modern collection of\nIndian folk-tales with her charming “Old Deccan Days” (London, John\nMurray, 1868; fourth edition, 1889). Her example has been followed by\nMiss Stokes, by Mrs. Steel, and Captain (now Major) Temple, by the\nPandit Natesa Sastri, by Mr. Knowles and Mr. Campbell, as well as\nothers who have published folk-tales in such periodicals as the\nIndian Antiquary and The Orientalist. The story-store of\nmodern India has been well dipped into during the last quarter of a\ncentury, though the immense range of the country leaves room for any\nnumber of additional workers and collections. Even so far as the\nmaterials already collected go, a large number of the commonest\nincidents in European folk-tales have been found in India. Whether\nbrought there or born there, we have scarcely any criterion for\njudging; but as some of those still current among the folk in India can\nbe traced back more than a millennium, the presumption is in favour of\nan Indian origin.",
        "From all these sources–from the Jatakas, from the Bidpai, and from the\nmore recent collections–I have selected those stories which throw most\nlight on the origin of Fable and Folk-tales, and at the same time are\nmost likely to attract English children. I have not, however, included\ntoo many stories of the Grimm types, lest I should repeat the contents\nof the two preceding volumes of this series. This has to some degree\nweakened the case for India as represented by this book. The need of\ncatering for the young ones has restricted my selection from the well-\nnamed “Ocean of the Streams of Story,” Katha-Sarit Sagara of\nSomadeva. The stories existing in Pali and Sanskrit I have taken from\ntranslations, mostly from the German of Benfey or the vigorous English\nof Professor Rhys-Davids, whom I have to thank for permission to use\nhis versions of the Jatakas.",
        "I have been enabled to make this book a representative collection of\nthe Fairy Tales of Ind by the kindness of the original collectors or\ntheir publishers. I have especially to thank Miss Frere, who kindly\nmade an exception in my favour, and granted me the use of that fine\nstory, “Punchkin,” and that quaint myth, “How Sun, Moon, and Wind went\nout to Dinner.” Miss Stokes has been equally gracious in granting me\nthe use of characteristic specimens from her “Indian Fairy Tales.” To\nMajor Temple I owe the advantage of selecting from his admirable\nWideawake Stories, and Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench & Co. have\nallowed me to use Mr. Knowles’ “Folk-tales of Kashmir,” in their\nOriental Library; and Messrs. W. H. Allen have been equally obliging\nwith regard to Mrs. Kingscote’s “Tales of the Sun.” Mr. M. L. Dames has\nenabled me add to the published story-store of India by granting me the\nuse of one from his inedited collection of Baluchi folk-tales.",
        "I have again to congratulate myself an the co-operation of my friend\nMr. J. D. Batten in giving beautiful or amusing form to the creations\nof the folk fancy of the Hindoos. It is no slight thing to embody, as\nhe has done, the glamour and the humour both of the Celt and of the\nHindoo. It is only a further proof that Fairy Tales are something more\nthan Celtic or Hindoo. They are human.",

        "The Bodhisatta was at one time born in the region of Himavanta as a\nwhite crane; now Brahmadatta was at that time reigning in Benares. Now\nit chanced that as a lion was eating meat a bone stuck in his throat.\nThe throat became swollen, he could not take food, his suffering was\nterrible. The crane seeing him, as he was perched an a tree looking for\nfood, asked, “What ails thee, friend?” He told him why. “I could free\nthee from that bone, friend, but dare not enter thy mouth for fear thou\nmightest eat me.” “Don’t be afraid, friend, I’ll not eat thee; only\nsave my life.” “Very well,” says he, and caused him to lie down on his\nleft side. But thinking to himself, “Who knows what this fellow will\ndo,” he placed a small stick upright between his two jaws that he could\nnot close his mouth, and inserting his head inside his mouth struck one\nend of the bone with his beak. Whereupon the bone dropped and fell out.\nAs soon as he had caused the bone to fall, he got out of the lion’s\nmouth, striking the stick with his beak so that it fell out, and then\nsettled on a branch. The lion gets well, and one day was eating a\nbuffalo he had killed. The crane, thinking “I will sound him,” settled\nan a branch just over him, and in conversation spoke this first verse:",
        "  “A service have we done thee\n    To the best of our ability,\n  King of the Beasts! Your Majesty!\n    What return shall we get from thee?”",
        "In reply the Lion spoke the second verse:",
        "  “As I feed on blood,\n    And always hunt for prey,\n  ’Tis much that thou art still alive\n    Having once been between my teeth.”",
        "Then in reply the crane said the two other verses:",
        "  “Ungrateful, doing no good,\n    Not doing as he would be done by,\n  In him there is no gratitude,\n    To serve him is useless.",
        "  “His friendship is not won\n    By the clearest good deed.\n  Better softly withdraw from him,\n    Neither envying nor abusing.”",
        "And having thus spoken the crane flew away.",
        "And when the great Teacher, Gautama the Buddha, told this tale, he\nused to add: “Now at that time the lion was Devadatta the Traitor, but\nthe white crane was I myself.”",
        "In a country there was a Raja who had an only son who every day went\nout to hunt. One day the Rani, his mother, said to him, “You can hunt\nwherever you like on these three sides; but you must never go to the\nfourth side.” This she said because she knew if he went on the fourth\nside he would hear of the beautiful Princess Labam, and that then he\nwould leave his father and mother and seek for the princess.",
        "The young prince listened to his mother, and obeyed her for some time;\nbut one day, when he was hunting on the three sides where he was\nallowed to go, he remembered what she had said to him about the fourth\nside, and he determined to go and see why she had forbidden him to hunt\non that side. When he got there, he found himself in a jungle, and\nnothing in the jungle but a quantity of parrots, who lived in it. The\nyoung Raja shot at some of them, and at once they all flew away up to\nthe sky. All, that is, but one, and this was their Raja, who was called\nHiraman parrot.",
        "When Hiraman parrot found himself left alone, he called out to the\nother parrots, “Don’t fly away and leave me alone when the Raja’s son\nshoots. If you desert me like this, I will tell the Princess Labam.”",
        "Then the parrots all flew back to their Raja, chattering. The prince\nwas greatly surprised, and said, “Why, these birds can talk!” Then he\nsaid to the parrots, “Who is the Princess Labam? Where does she live?\"\nBut the parrots would not tell him where she lived. “You can never get\nto the Princess Labam’s country.” That is all they would say.",
        "The prince grew very sad when they would not tell him anything more;\nand he threw his gun away, and went home. When he got home, he would\nnot speak or eat, but lay on his bed for four or five days, and seemed\nvery ill.",
        "At last he told his father and mother that he wanted to go and see the\nPrincess Labam. “I must go,” he said; “I must see what she is like.\nTell me where her country is.”",
        "“We do not know where it is,” answered his father and mother.",
        "“Then I must go and look for it,” said the prince.",
        "“No, no,” they said, “you must not leave us. You are our only son. Stay\nwith us. You will never find the Princess Labam.”",
        "“I must try and find her,” said the prince. “Perhaps God will show me\nthe way. If I live and I find her, I will come back to you; but perhaps\nI shall die, and then I shall never see you again. Still I must go.”",
        "So they had to let him go, though they cried very much at parting with\nhim. His father gave him fine clothes to wear, and a fine horse. And he\ntook his gun, and his bow and arrows, and a great many other weapons,\n\"for,” he said, “I may want them.” His father, too, gave him plenty of\nrupees.",
        "Then he himself got his horse all ready for the journey, and he said\ngood-bye to his father and mother; and his mother took her handkerchief\nand wrapped some sweetmeats in it, and gave it to her son. “My child,\"\nshe said to him, “When you are hungry eat some of these sweetmeats.”",
        "He then set out on his journey, and rode on and on till he came to a\njungle in which were a tank and shady trees. He bathed himself and his\nhorse in the tank, and then sat down under a tree. “Now,” he said to\nhimself, “I will eat some of the sweetmeats my mother gave me, and I\nwill drink some water, and then I will continue my journey.” He opened\nhis handkerchief, and took out a sweetmeat. He found an ant in it. He\ntook out another. There was an ant in that one too. So he laid the two\nsweetmeats on the ground, and he took out another, and another, and\nanother, until he had taken them all out; but in each he found an ant.\n\"Never mind,” he said, “I won’t eat the sweetmeats; the ants shall eat\nthem.” Then the Ant-Raja came and stood before him and said, “You have\nbeen good to us. If ever you are in trouble, think of me and we will\ncome to you.”",
        "The Raja’s son thanked him, mounted his horse and continued his\njourney. He rode on and on until he came to another jungle, and there\nhe saw a tiger who had a thorn in his foot, and was roaring loudly from\nthe pain.",
        "“Why do you roar like that?” said the young Raja. “What is the matter\nwith you?”",
        "“I have had a thorn in my foot for twelve years,” answered the tiger,\n\"and it hurts me so; that is why I roar.”",
        "“Well,” said the Raja’s son, “I will take it out for you. But perhaps,\nas you are a tiger, when I have made you well, you will eat me?”",
        "“Oh, no,” said the tiger, “I won’t eat you. Do make me well.”",
        "Then the prince took a little knife from his pocket, and cut the thorn\nout of the tiger’s foot; but when he cut, the tiger roared louder than\never–so loud that his wife heard him in the next jungle, and came\nbounding along to see what was the matter. The tiger saw her coming,\nand hid the prince in the jungle, so that she should not see him.",
        "“What man hurt you that you roared so loud?” said the wife. “No one\nhurt me,” answered the husband; “but a Raja’s son came and took the\nthorn out of my foot.”",
        "“Where is he? Show him to me,” said his wife.",
        "“If you promise not to kill him, I will call him,” said the tiger.",
        "“I won’t kill him; only let me see him,” answered his wife.",
        "Then the tiger called the Raja’s son, and when he came the tiger and\nhis wife made him a great many salaams. Then they gave him a good\ndinner, and he stayed with them for three days. Every day he looked at\nthe tiger’s foot, and the third day it was quite healed. Then he said\ngood-bye to the tigers, and the tiger said to him, “If ever you are in\ntrouble, think of me, and we will come to you.”",
        "The Raja’s son rode on and on till he came to a third jungle. Here he\nfound four fakirs whose teacher and master had died, and had left four\nthings,–a bed, which carried whoever sat on it whithersoever he wished\nto go; a bag, that gave its owner whatever he wanted, jewels, food, or\nclothes; a stone bowl that gave its owner as much water as he wanted,\nno matter how far he might be from a tank; and a stick and rope, to\nwhich its owner had only to say, if any one came to make war on him,\n\"Stick, beat as many men and soldiers as are here,” and the stick would\nbeat them and the rope would tie them up.",
        "The four fakirs were quarrelling over these four things. One said, “I\nwant this;” another said, “You cannot have it, for I want it;” and so\non.",
        "The Raja’s son said to them, “Do not quarrel for these things. I will\nshoot four arrows in four different directions. Whichever of you gets\nto my first arrow, shall have the first thing–the bed. Whosoever gets\nto the second arrow, shall have the second thing–the bag. He who gets\nto the third arrow, shall have the third thing–the bowl. And he who\ngets to the fourth arrow, shall have the last things–the stick and\nrope.” To this they agreed, and the prince shot off his first arrow.\nAway raced the fakirs to get it. When they brought it back to him he\nshot off the second, and when they had found and brought it to him he\nshot off his third, and when they had brought him the third he shot off\nthe fourth.",
        "While they were away looking for the fourth arrow the Raja’s son let\nhis horse loose in the jungle, and sat on the bed, taking the bowl, the\nstick and rope, and the bag with him. Then he said, “Bed, I wish to go\nto the Princess Labam’s country.” The little bed instantly rose up into\nthe air and began to fly, and it flew and flew till it came to the\nPrincess Labam’s country, where it settled on the ground. The Raja’s\nson asked some men he saw, “Whose country is this?”",
        "“The Princess Labam’s country,” they answered. Then the prince went on\ntill he came to a house where he saw an old woman.",
        "“Who are you?” she said. “Where do you come from?”",
        "“I come from a far country,” he said; “do let me stay with you to-\nnight.”",
        "“No,” she answered, “I cannot let you stay with me; for our king has\nordered that men from other countries may not stay in his country. You\ncannot stay in my house.”",
        "“You are my aunty,” said the prince; “let me remain with you for this\none night. You see it is evening, and if I go into the jungle, then the\nwild beasts will eat me.”",
        "“Well,” said the old woman, “you may stay here to-night; but to-morrow\nmorning you must go away, for if the king hears you have passed the\nnight in my house, he will have me seized and put into prison.”",
        "Then she took him into her house, and the Raja’s son was very glad. The\nold woman began preparing dinner, but he stopped her, “Aunty,” he said,\n\"I will give you food.” He put his hand into his bag, saying, “Bag, I\nwant some dinner,” and the bag gave him instantly a delicious dinner,\nserved up on two gold plates. The old woman and the Raja’s son then\ndined together.",
        "When they had finished eating, the old woman said, “Now I will fetch\nsome water.”",
        "“Don’t go,” said the prince. “You shall have plenty of water directly.\"\nSo he took his bowl and said to it, “Bowl, I want some water,” and then\nit filled with water. When it was full, the prince cried out, “Stop,\nbowl,” and the bowl stopped filling. “See, aunty,” he said, “with this\nbowl I can always get as much water as I want.”",
        "By this time night had come. “Aunty,” said the Raja’s son, “why don’t\nyou light a lamp?”",
        "“There is no need,” she said. “Our king has forbidden the people in his\ncountry to light any lamps; for, as soon as it is dark, his daughter,\nthe Princess Labam, comes and sits on her roof, and she shines so that\nshe lights up all the country and our houses, and we can see to do our\nwork as if it were day.”",
        "When it was quite black night the princess got up. She dressed herself\nin her rich clothes and jewels, and rolled up her hair, and across her\nhead she put a band of diamonds and pearls. Then she shone like the\nmoon, and her beauty made night day. She came out of her room, and sat\non the roof of her palace. In the daytime she never came out of her\nhouse; she only came out at night. All the people in her father’s\ncountry then went about their work and finished it.",
        "The Raja’s son watched the princess quietly, and was very happy. He\nsaid to himself, “How lovely she is!”",
        "At midnight, when everybody had gone to bed, the princess came down\nfrom her roof, and went to her room; and when she was in bed and\nasleep, the Raja’s son got up softly, and sat on his bed. “Bed,” he\nsaid to it, “I want to go to the Princess Labam’s bed-room.” So the\nlittle bed carried him to the room where she lay fast asleep.",
        "The young Raja took his bag and said, “I want a great deal of betel-\nleaf,” and it at once gave him quantities of betel-leaf. This he laid\nnear the princess’s bed, and then his little bed carried him back to\nthe old woman’s house.",
        "Next morning all the princess’s servants found the betel-leaf, and\nbegan to eat it. “Where did you get all that betel-leaf?” asked the\nprincess.",
        "“We found it near your bed,” answered the servants. Nobody knew the\nprince had come in the night and put it all there.",
        "In the morning the old woman came to the Raja’s son. “Now it is\nmorning,” she said, “and you must go; for if the king finds out all I\nhave done for you, he will seize me.”",
        "“I am ill to-day, dear aunty,” said the prince; “do let me stay till\nto-morrow morning.”",
        "“Good,” said the old woman. So he stayed, and they took their dinner\nout of the bag, and the bowl gave them water.",
        "When night came the princess got up and sat on her roof, and at twelve\no’clock, when every one was in bed, she went to her bed-room, and was\nsoon fast asleep. Then the Raja’s son sat on his bed, and it carried\nhim to the princess. He took his bag and said, “Bag, I want a most\nlovely shawl.” It gave him a splendid shawl, and he spread it over the\nprincess as she lay asleep. Then he went back to the old woman’s house\nand slept till morning.",
        "In the morning, when the princess saw the shawl she was delighted.\n\"See, mother,” she said; “Khuda must have given me this shawl, it is so\nbeautiful.” Her mother was very glad too.",
        "“Yes, my child,” she said; “Khuda must have given you this splendid\nshawl.”",
        "When it was morning the old woman said to the Raja’s son, “Now you must\nreally go.”",
        "“Aunty,” he answered, “I am not well enough yet. Let me stay a few days\nlonger. I will remain hidden in your house, so that no one may see me.\"\nSo the old woman let him stay.",
        "When it was black night, the princess put on her lovely clothes and\njewels, and sat on her roof. At midnight she went to her room and went\nto sleep. Then the Raja’s son sat on his bed and flew to her bed-room.\nThere he said to his bag, “Bag, I want a very, very beautiful ring.\"\nThe bag gave him a glorious ring. Then he took the Princess Labam’s\nhand gently to put on the ring, and she started up very much\nfrightened.",
        "“Who are you?” she said to the prince. “Where do you come from? Why do\nyou come to my room?”",
        "“Do not be afraid, princess,” he said; “I am no thief. I am a great\nRaja’s son. Hiraman parrot, who lives in the jungle where I went to\nhunt, told me your name, and then I left my father and mother, and came\nto see you.”",
        "“Well,” said the princess, “as you are the son of such a great Raja, I\nwill not have you killed, and I will tell my father and mother that I\nwish to marry you.”",
        "The prince then returned to the old woman’s house; and when morning\ncame the princess said to her mother, “The son of a great Raja has come\nto this country, and I wish to marry him.” Her mother told this to the\nking.",
        "“Good,” said the king; “but if this Raja’s son wishes to marry my\ndaughter, he must first do whatever I bid him. If he fails I will kill\nhim. I will give him eighty pounds weight of mustard seed, and out of\nthis he must crush the oil in one day. If he cannot do this he shall\ndie.”",
        "In the morning the Raja’s son told the old woman that he intended to\nmarry the princess. “Oh,” said the old woman, “go away from this\ncountry, and do not think of marrying her. A great many Rajas and\nRajas’ sons have come here to marry her, and her father has had them\nall killed. He says whoever wishes to marry his daughter must first do\nwhatever he bids him. If he can, then he shall marry the princess; if\nhe cannot, the king will have him killed. But no one can do the things\nthe king tells him to do; so all the Rajas and Rajas’ sons who have\ntried have been put to death. You will be killed too, if you try. Do go\naway.” But the prince would not listen to anything she said.",
        "The king sent for the prince to the old woman’s house, and his servants\nbrought the Raja’s son to the king’s court-house to the king. There the\nking gave him eighty pounds of mustard seed, and told him to crush all\nthe oil out of it that day, and bring it next morning to him to the\ncourt-house. “Whoever wishes to marry my daughter,” he said to the\nprince, “must first do all I tell him. If he cannot, then I have him\nkilled. So if you cannot crush all the oil out of this mustard seed,\nyou will die.”",
        "The prince was very sorry when he heard this. “How can I crush the oil\nout of all this mustard seed in one day?” he said to himself; “and if I\ndo not, the king will kill me.” He took the mustard seed to the old\nwoman’s house, and did not know what to do. At last he remembered the\nAnt-Raja, and the moment he did so, the Ant-Raja and his ants came to\nhim. “Why do you look so sad?” said the Ant-Raja.",
        "The prince showed him the mustard seed, and said to him, “How can I\ncrush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day? And if I do not\ntake the oil to the king to-morrow morning, he will kill me.”",
        "“Be happy,” said the Ant-Raja; “lie down and sleep; we will crush all\nthe oil out for you during the day, and to-morrow morning you shall\ntake it to the king.” The Raja’s son lay down and slept, and the ants\ncrushed out the oil for him. The prince was very glad when he saw the\noil.",
        "The next morning he took it to the court-house to the king. But the\nking said, “You cannot yet marry my daughter. If you wish to do so, you\nmust first fight with my two demons and kill them.” The king a long\ntime ago had caught two demons, and then, as he did not know what to do\nwith them, he had shut them up in a cage. He was afraid to let them\nloose for fear they would eat up all the people in his country; and he\ndid not know how to kill them. So all the kings and kings’ sons who\nwanted to marry the Princess Labam had to fight with these demons;\n\"for,” said the king to himself, “perhaps the demons may be killed, and\nthen I shall be rid of them.”",
        "When he heard of the demons the Raja’s son was very sad. “What can I\ndo?” he said to himself. “How can I fight with these two demons?” Then\nhe thought of his tiger: and the tiger and his wife came to him and\nsaid, “Why are you so sad?” The Raja’s son answered, “The king has\nordered me to fight with his two demons and kill them. How can I do\nthis?” “Do not be frightened,” said the tiger. “Be happy. I and my wife\nwill fight with them for you.”",
        "Then the Raja’s son took out of his bag two splendid coats. They were\nall gold and silver, and covered with pearls and diamonds. These he put\non the tigers to make them beautiful, and he took them to the king, and\nsaid to him, “May these tigers fight your demons for me?” “Yes,” said\nthe king, who did not care in the least who killed his demons, provided\nthey were killed. “Then call your demons,” said the Raja’s son, “and\nthese tigers will fight them.” The king did so, and the tigers and the\ndemons fought and fought until the tigers had killed the demons.",
        "“That is good,” said the king. “But you must do something else before I\ngive you my daughter. Up in the sky I have a kettle-drum. You must go\nand beat it. If you cannot do this, I will kill you.”",
        "The Raja’s son thought of his little bed; so he went to the old woman’s\nhouse and sat on his bed. “Little bed,” he said, “up in the sky is the\nking’s kettle-drum. I want to go to it.” The bed flew up with him, and\nthe Raja’s son beat the drum, and the king heard him. Still, when he\ncame down, the king would not give him his daughter. “You have,” he\nsaid to the prince, “done the three things I told you to do; but you\nmust do one thing more.” “If I can, I will,” said the Raja’s son.",
        "Then the king showed him the trunk of a tree that was lying near his\ncourt-house. It was a very, very thick trunk. He gave the prince a wax\nhatchet, and said, “Tomorrow morning you must cut this trunk in two\nwith this wax hatchet.”",
        "The Raja’s son went back to the old woman’s house. He was very sad, and\nthought that now the Raja would certainly kill him. “I had his oil\ncrushed out by the ants,” he said to himself. “I had his demons killed\nby the tigers. My bed helped me to beat his kettle-drum. But now what\ncan I do? How can I cut that thick tree-trunk in two with a wax\nhatchet?”",
        "At night he went on his bed to see the princess. “To-morrow,” he said\nto her, “your father will kill me.” “Why?” asked the princess.",
        "“He has told me to cut a thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet.\nHow can I ever do that?” said the Raja’s son. “Do not be afraid,” said\nthe princess; “do as I bid you, and you will cut it in two quite\neasily.”",
        "Then she pulled out a hair from her head, and gave it to the prince.\n\"To-morrow,” she said, “when no one is near you, you must say to the\ntree-trunk, ’The Princess Labam commands you to let yourself be cut in\ntwo by this hair.’ Then stretch the hair down the edge of the wax\nhatchet’s blade.”",
        "The prince next day did exactly as the princess had told him; and the\nminute the hair that was stretched down the edge of the hatchet-blade\ntouched the tree-trunk it split into two pieces.",
        "The king said, “Now you can marry my daughter.” Then the wedding took\nplace. All the Rajas and kings of the countries round were asked to\ncome to it, and there were great rejoicings. After a few days the\nprince’s son said to his wife, “Let us go to my father’s country.” The\nPrincess Labam’s father gave them a quantity of camels and horses and\nrupees and servants; and they travelled in great state to the prince’s\ncountry, where they lived happily.",
        "The prince always kept his bag, bowl, bed, and stick; only, as no one\never came to make war on him, he never needed to use the stick.",
        "Once upon a time there was a wee wee Lambikin, who frolicked about on\nhis little tottery legs, and enjoyed himself amazingly.",
        "Now one day he set off to visit his Granny, and was jumping with joy to\nthink of all the good things he should get from her, when who should he\nmeet but a Jackal, who looked at the tender young morsel and said:\n\"Lambikin! Lambikin! I’ll EAT YOU!”",
        "But Lambikin only gave a little frisk and said:",
        "  “To Granny’s house I go,\n  Where I shall fatter grow,\n  Then you can eat me so.”",
        "The Jackal thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass.",
        "By-and-by he met a Vulture, and the Vulture, looking hungrily at the\ntender morsel before him, said: “Lambikin! Lambikin! I’ll EAT YOU!”",
        "But Lambikin only gave a little frisk, and said:",
        "  “To Granny’s house I go,\n  Where I shall fatter grow,\n  Then you can eat me so.”",
        "The Vulture thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass.",
        "And by-and-by he met a Tiger, and then a Wolf, and a Dog, and an Eagle,\nand all these, when they saw the tender little morsel, said: “Lambikin!\nLambikin! I’ll EAT YOU!”",
        "But to all of them Lambikin replied, with a little frisk:",
        "  “To Granny’s house I go,\n  Where I shall fatter grow,\n  Then you can eat me so.”",
        "At last he reached his Granny’s house, and said, all in a great hurry,\n\"Granny, dear, I’ve promised to get very fat; so, as people ought to\nkeep their promises, please put me into the corn-bin at once.”",
        "So his Granny said he was a good boy, and put him into the corn-bin,\nand there the greedy little Lambikin stayed for seven days, and ate,\nand ate, and ate, until he could scarcely waddle, and his Granny said\nhe was fat enough for anything, and must go home. But cunning little\nLambikin said that would never do, for some animal would be sure to eat\nhim on the way back, he was so plump and tender.",
        "“I’ll tell you what you must do,” said Master Lambikin, “you must make\na little drumikin out of the skin of my little brother who died, and\nthen I can sit inside and trundle along nicely, for I’m as tight as a\ndrum myself.”",
        "So his Granny made a nice little drumikin out of his brother’s skin,\nwith the wool inside, and Lambikin curled himself up snug and warm in\nthe middle, and trundled away gaily. Soon he met with the Eagle, who\ncalled out:",
        "  “Drumikin! Drumikin!\n  Have you seen Lambikin?”",
        "And Mr. Lambikin, curled up in his soft warm nest, replied:",
        "  “Fallen into the fire, and so will you\n  On little Drumikin. Tum-pa, tum-too!”",
        "“How very annoying!” sighed the Eagle, thinking regretfully of the\ntender morsel he had let slip.",
        "Meanwhile Lambikin trundled along, laughing to himself, and singing:",
        "  “Tum-pa, tum-too;\n  Tum-pa, tum-too!”",
        "Every animal and bird he met asked him the same question:",
        "  “Drumikin! Drumikin!\n  Have you seen Lambikin?”",
        "And to each of them the little slyboots replied:",
        "  “Fallen into the fire, and so will you\n  On little Drumikin. Tum-pa, tum too;\n  Tum-pa, tum-too; Tum-pa, tum-too!”",
        "Then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had let\nslip.",
        "At last the Jackal came limping along, for all his sorry looks as sharp\nas a needle, and he too called out–",
        "  “Drumikin! Drumikin!\n  Have you seen Lambikin?”",
        "And Lambikin, curled up in his snug little nest, replied gaily:",
        "  “Fallen into the fire, and so will you\n  On little Drumikin! Tum-pa–”",
        "But he never got any further, for the Jackal recognised his voice at\nonce, and cried: “Hullo! you’ve turned yourself inside out, have you?\nJust you come out of that!”",
        "Whereupon he tore open Drumikin and gobbled up Lambikin.",
        "Once upon a time there was a Raja who had seven beautiful daughters.\nThey were all good girls; but the youngest, named Balna, was more\nclever than the rest. The Raja’s wife died when they were quite little\nchildren, so these seven poor Princesses were left with no mother to\ntake care of them.",
        "The Raja’s daughters took it by turns to cook their father’s dinner\nevery day, whilst he was absent deliberating with his Ministers on the\naffairs of the nation.",
        "About this time the Prudhan died, leaving a widow and one daughter; and\nevery day, every day, when the seven Princesses were preparing their\nfather’s dinner, the Prudhan’s widow and daughter would come and beg\nfor a little fire from the hearth. Then Balna used to say to her\nsisters, “Send that woman away; send her away. Let her get the fire at\nher own house. What does she want with ours? If we allow her to come\nhere, we shall suffer for it some day.”",
        "But the other sisters would answer, “Be quiet, Balna; why must you\nalways be quarrelling with this poor woman? Let her take some fire if\nshe likes.” Then the Prudhan’s widow used to go to the hearth and take\na few sticks from it; and whilst no one was looking, she would quickly\nthrow some mud into the midst of the dishes which were being prepared\nfor the Raja’s dinner.",
        "Now the Raja was very fond of his daughters. Ever since their mother’s\ndeath they had cooked his dinner with their own hands, in order to\navoid the danger of his being poisoned by his enemies. So, when he\nfound the mud mixed up with his dinner, he thought it must arise from\ntheir carelessness, as it did not seem likely that any one should have\nput mud there on purpose; but being very kind he did not like to\nreprove them for it, although this spoiling of the curry was repeated\nmany successive days.",
        "At last, one day, he determined to hide, and watch his daughters\ncooking, and see how it all happened; so he went into the next room,\nand watched them through a hole in the wall.",
        "There he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice and\npreparing the curry, and as each dish was completed, they put it by the\nfire ready to be cooked. Next he noticed the Prudhan’s widow come to\nthe door, and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her dinner\nwith. Balna turned to her, angrily, and said, “Why don’t you keep fuel\nin your own house, and not come here every day and take ours? Sisters,\ndon’t give this woman any more wood; let her buy it for herself.”",
        "Then the eldest sister answered, “Balna, let the poor woman take the\nwood and the fire; she does us no harm.” But Balna replied, “If you let\nher come here so often, maybe she will do us some harm, and make us\nsorry for it, some day.”",
        "The Raja then saw the Prudhan’s widow go to the place where all his\ndinner was nicely prepared, and, as she took the wood, she threw a\nlittle mud into each of the dishes.",
        "At this he was very angry, and sent to have the woman seized and\nbrought before him. But when the widow came, she told him that she had\nplayed this trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him; and\nshe spoke so cleverly, and pleased him so well with her cunning words,\nthat instead of punishing her, the Raja married her, and made her his\nRanee, and she and her daughter came to live in the palace.",
        "Now the new Ranee hated the seven poor Princesses, and wanted to get\nthem, if possible, out of the way, in order that her daughter might\nhave all their riches, and live in the palace as Princess in their\nplace; and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to her,\nshe did all she could to make them miserable. She gave them nothing but\nbread to eat, and very little of that, and very little water to drink;\nso these seven poor little Princesses, who had been accustomed to have\neverything comfortable about them, and good food and good clothes all\ntheir lives long, were very miserable and unhappy; and they used to go\nout every day and sit by their dead mother’s tomb and cry–and say:",
        "“Oh mother, mother, cannot you see your poor children, how unhappy we\nare, and how we are starved by our cruel step-mother?”",
        "One day, whilst they were thus sobbing and crying, lo and behold! a\nbeautiful pomelo tree grew up out of the grave, covered with fresh ripe\npomeloes, and the children satisfied their hunger by eating some of the\nfruit, and every day after this, instead of trying to eat the bad\ndinner their step-mother provided for them, they used to go out to\ntheir mother’s grave and eat the pomeloes which grew there on the\nbeautiful tree.",
        "Then the Ranee said to her daughter, “I cannot tell how it is, every\nday those seven girls say they don’t want any dinner, and won’t eat\nany; and yet they never grow thin nor look ill; they look better than\nyou do. I cannot tell how it is.” And she bade her watch the seven\nPrincesses, and see if any one gave them anything to eat.",
        "So next day, when the Princesses went to their mother’s grave, and were\neating the beautiful pomeloes, the Prudhan’s daughter followed them,\nand saw them gathering the fruit.",
        "Then Balna said to her sisters, “Do you not see that girl watching us?\nLet us drive her away, or hide the pomeloes, else she will go and tell\nher mother all about it, and that will be very bad for us.”",
        "But the other sisters said, “Oh no, do not be unkind, Balna. The girl\nwould never be so cruel as to tell her mother. Let us rather invite her\nto come and have some of the fruit.” And calling her to them, they gave\nher one of the pomeloes.",
        "No sooner had she eaten it, however, than the Prudhan’s daughter went\nhome and said to her mother, “I do not wonder the seven Princesses will\nnot eat the dinner you prepare for them, for by their mother’s grave\nthere grows a beautiful pomelo tree, and they go there every day and\neat the pomeloes. I ate one, and it was the nicest I have ever tasted.”",
        "The cruel Ranee was much vexed at hearing this, and all next day she\nstayed in her room, and told the Raja that she had a very bad headache.\nThe Raja was deeply grieved, and said to his wife, “What can I do for\nyou?” She answered, “There is only one thing that will make my headache\nwell. By your dead wife’s tomb there grows a fine pomelo tree; you must\nbring that here, and boil it, root and branch, and put a little of the\nwater in which it has been boiled, on my forehead, and that will cure\nmy headache.” So the Raja sent his servants, and had the beautiful\npomelo tree pulled up by the roots, and did as the Ranee desired; and\nwhen some of the water, in which it had been boiled, was put on her\nforehead, she said her headache was gone and she felt quite well.",
        "Next day, when the seven Princesses went as usual to the grave of their\nmother, the pomelo tree had disappeared. Then they all began to cry\nvery bitterly.",
        "Now there was by the Ranee’s tomb a small tank, and as they were crying\nthey saw that the tank was filled with a rich cream-like substance,\nwhich quickly hardened into a thick white cake. At seeing this all the\nPrincesses were very glad, and they ate some of the cake, and liked it;\nand next day the same thing happened, and so it went on for many days.\nEvery morning the Princesses went to their mother’s grave, and found\nthe little tank filled with the nourishing cream-like cake. Then the\ncruel step-mother said to her daughter: “I cannot tell how it is, I\nhave had the pomelo tree which used to grow by the Ranee’s grave\ndestroyed, and yet the Princesses grow no thinner, nor look more sad,\nthough they never eat the dinner I give them. I cannot tell how it is!”",
        "And her daughter said, “I will watch.”",
        "Next day, while the Princesses were eating the cream cake, who should\ncome by but their step-mother’s daughter. Balna saw her first, and\nsaid, “See, sisters, there comes that girl again. Let us sit round the\nedge of the tank and not allow her to see it, for if we give her some\nof our cake, she will go and tell her mother; and that will be very\nunfortunate for us.”",
        "The other sisters, however, thought Balna unnecessarily suspicious, and\ninstead of following her advice, they gave the Prudhan’s daughter some\nof the cake, and she went home and told her mother all about it.",
        "The Ranee, on hearing how well the Princesses fared, was exceedingly\nangry, and sent her servants to pull down the dead Ranee’s tomb, and\nfill the little tank with the ruins. And not content with this, she\nnext day pretended to be very, very ill–in fact, at the point of\ndeath–and when the Raja was much grieved, and asked her whether it was\nin his power to procure her any remedy, she said to him: “Only one\nthing can save my life, but I know you will not do it.” He replied,\n\"Yes, whatever it is, I will do it.” She then said, “To save my life,\nyou must kill the seven daughters of your first wife, and put some of\ntheir blood on my forehead and on the palms of my hands, and their\ndeath will be my life.” At these words the Raja was very sorrowful; but\nbecause he feared to break his word, he went out with a heavy heart to\nfind his daughters.",
        "He found them crying by the ruins of their mother’s grave.",
        "Then, feeling he could not kill them, the Raja spoke kindly to them,\nand told them to come out into the jungle with him; and there he made a\nfire and cooked some rice, and gave it to them. But in the afternoon,\nit being very hot, the seven Princesses all fell asleep, and when he\nsaw they were fast asleep, the Raja, their father, stole away and left\nthem (for he feared his wife), saying to himself: “It is better my poor\ndaughters should die here, than be killed by their step-mother.”",
        "He then shot a deer, and returning home, put some of its blood on the\nforehead and hands of the Ranee, and she thought then that he had\nreally killed the Princesses, and said she felt quite well.",
        "Meantime the seven Princesses awoke, and when they found themselves all\nalone in the thick jungle they were much frightened, and began to call\nout as loud as they could, in hopes of making their father hear; but he\nwas by that time far away, and would not have been able to hear them\neven had their voices been as loud as thunder.",
        "It so happened that this very day the seven young sons of a\nneighbouring Raja chanced to be hunting in that same jungle, and as\nthey were returning home, after the day’s sport was over, the youngest\nPrince said to his brothers “Stop, I think I hear some one crying and\ncalling out. Do you not hear voices? Let us go in the direction of the\nsound, and find out what it is.”",
        "So the seven Princes rode through the wood until they came to the place\nwhere the seven Princesses sat crying and wringing their hands. At the\nsight of them the young Princes were very much astonished, and still\nmore so on learning their story; and they settled that each should take\none of these poor forlorn ladies home with him, and marry her.",
        "So the first and eldest Prince took the eldest Princess home with him,\nand married her.",
        "And the second took the second;",
        "And the third took the third;",
        "And the fourth took the fourth;",
        "And the fifth took the fifth;",
        "And the sixth took the sixth;",
        "And the seventh, and the handsomest of all, took the beautiful Balna.",
        "And when they got to their own land, there was great rejoicing\nthroughout the kingdom, at the marriage of the seven young Princes to\nseven such beautiful Princesses.",
        "About a year after this Balna had a little son, and his uncles and\naunts were so fond of the boy that it was as if he had seven fathers\nand seven mothers. None of the other Princes and Princesses had any\nchildren, so the son of the seventh Prince and Balna was acknowledged\ntheir heir by all the rest.",
        "They had thus lived very happily for some time, when one fine day the\nseventh Prince (Balna’s husband) said he would go out hunting, and away\nhe went; and they waited long for him, but he never came back.",
        "Then his six brothers said they would go and see what had become of\nhim; and they went away, but they also did not return.",
        "And the seven Princesses grieved very much, for they feared that their\nkind husbands must have been killed.",
        "One day, not long after this had happened, as Balna was rocking her\nbaby’s cradle, and whilst her sisters were working in the room below,\nthere came to the palace door a man in a long black dress, who said\nthat he was a Fakir, and came to beg. The servants said to him, “You\ncannot go into the palace–the Raja’s sons have all gone away; we think\nthey must be dead, and their widows cannot be interrupted by your\nbegging.” But he said, “I am a holy man, you must let me in.” Then the\nstupid servants let him walk through the palace, but they did not know\nthat this was no Fakir, but a wicked Magician named Punchkin.",
        "Punchkin Fakir wandered through the palace, and saw many beautiful\nthings there, till at last he reached the room where Balna sat singing\nbeside her little boy’s cradle. The Magician thought her more beautiful\nthan all the other beautiful things he had seen, insomuch that he asked\nher to go home with him and to marry him. But she said, “My husband, I\nfear, is dead, but my little boy is still quite young; I will stay here\nand teach him to grow up a clever man, and when he is grown up he shall\ngo out into the world, and try and learn tidings of his father. Heaven\nforbid that I should ever leave him, or marry you.” At these words the\nMagician was very angry, and turned her into a little black dog, and\nled her away; saying, “Since you will not come with me of your own free\nwill, I will make you.” So the poor Princess was dragged away, without\nany power of effecting an escape, or of letting her sisters know what\nhad become of her. As Punchkin passed through the palace gate the\nservants said to him, “Where did you get that pretty little dog?” And\nhe answered, “One of the Princesses gave it to me as a present.” At\nhearing which they let him go without further questioning.",
        "Soon after this, the six elder Princesses heard the little baby, their\nnephew, begin to cry, and when they went upstairs they were much\nsurprised to find him all alone, and Balna nowhere to be seen. Then\nthey questioned the servants, and when they heard of the Fakir and the\nlittle black dog, they guessed what had happened, and sent in every\ndirection seeking them, but neither the Fakir nor the dog were to be\nfound. What could six poor women do? They gave up all hopes of ever\nseeing their kind husbands, and their sister, and her husband, again,\nand devoted themselves thenceforward to teaching and taking care of\ntheir little nephew.",
        "Thus time went on, till Balna’s son was fourteen years old. Then, one\nday, his aunts told him the history of the family; and no sooner did he\nhear it, than he was seized with a great desire to go in search of his\nfather and mother and uncles, and if he could find them alive to bring\nthem home again. His aunts, on learning his determination, were much\nalarmed and tried to dissuade him, saying, “We have lost our husbands,\nand our sister and her husband, and you are now our sole hope; if you\ngo away, what shall we do?” But he replied, “I pray you not to be\ndiscouraged; I will return soon, and if it is possible bring my father\nand mother and uncles with me.” So he set out on his travels; but for\nsome months he could learn nothing to help him in his search.",
        "At last, after he had journeyed many hundreds of weary miles, and\nbecome almost hopeless of ever hearing anything further of his parents,\nhe one day came to a country that seemed full of stones, and rocks, and\ntrees, and there he saw a large palace with a high tower; hard by which\nwas a Malee’s little house.",
        "As he was looking about, the Malee’s wife saw him, and ran out of the\nhouse and said, “My dear boy, who are you that dare venture to this\ndangerous place?” He answered, “I am a Raja’s son, and I come in search\nof my father, and my uncles, and my mother whom a wicked enchanter\nbewitched.”",
        "Then the Malee’s wife said, “This country and this palace belong to a\ngreat enchanter; he is all powerful, and if any one displeases him, he\ncan turn them into stones and trees. All the rocks and trees you see\nhere were living people once, and the Magician turned them to what they\nnow are. Some time ago a Raja’s son came here, and shortly afterwards\ncame his six brothers, and they were all turned into stones and trees;\nand these are not the only unfortunate ones, for up in that tower lives\na beautiful Princess, whom the Magician has kept prisoner there for\ntwelve years, because she hates him and will not marry him.”",
        "Then the little Prince thought, “These must be my parents and my\nuncles. I have found what I seek at last.” So he told his story to the\nMalee’s wife, and begged her to help him to remain in that place awhile\nand inquire further concerning the unhappy people she mentioned; and\nshe promised to befriend him, and advised his disguising himself lest\nthe Magician should see him, and turn him likewise into stone. To this\nthe Prince agreed. So the Malee’s wife dressed him up in a saree, and\npretended that he was her daughter.",
        "One day, not long after this, as the Magician was walking in his garden\nhe saw the little girl (as he thought) playing about, and asked her who\nshe was. She told him she was the Malee’s daughter, and the Magician\nsaid, “You are a pretty little girl, and to-morrow you shall take a\npresent of flowers from me to the beautiful lady who lives in the\ntower.”",
        "The young Prince was much delighted at hearing this, and went\nimmediately to inform the Malee’s wife; after consultation with whom he\ndetermined that it would be more safe for him to retain his disguise,\nand trust to the chance of a favourable opportunity for establishing\nsome communication with his mother, if it were indeed she.",
        "Now it happened that at Balna’s marriage her husband had given her a\nsmall gold ring on which her name was engraved, and she had put it on\nher little son’s finger when he was a baby, and afterwards when he was\nolder his aunts had had it enlarged for him, so that he was still able\nto wear it. The Malee’s wife advised him to fasten the well-known\ntreasure to one of the bouquets he presented to his mother, and trust\nto her recognising it. This was not to be done without difficulty, as\nsuch a strict watch was kept over the poor Princess (for fear of her\never establishing communication with her friends), that though the\nsupposed Malee’s daughter was permitted to take her flowers every day,\nthe Magician or one of his slaves was always in the room at the time.\nAt last one day, however, opportunity favoured him, and when no one was\nlooking, the boy tied the ring to a nosegay, and threw it at Balna’s\nfeet. It fell with a clang on the floor, and Balna, looking to see what\nmade the strange sound, found the little ring tied to the flowers. On\nrecognising it, she at once believed the story her son told her of his\nlong search, and begged him to advise her as to what she had better do;\nat the same time entreating him on no account to endanger his life by\ntrying to rescue her. She told him that for twelve long years the\nMagician had kept her shut up in the tower because she refused to marry\nhim, and she was so closely guarded that she saw no hope of release.",
        "Now Balna’s son was a bright, clever boy, so he said, “Do not fear,\ndear mother; the first thing to do is to discover how far the\nMagician’s power extends, in order that we may be able to liberate my\nfather and uncles, whom he has imprisoned in the form of rocks and\ntrees. You have spoken to him angrily for twelve long years; now rather\nspeak kindly. Tell him you have given up all hopes of again seeing the\nhusband you have so long mourned, and say you are willing to marry him.\nThen endeavour to find out what his power consists in, and whether he\nis immortal, or can be put to death.”",
        "Balna determined to take her son’s advice; and the next day sent for\nPunchkin, and spoke to him as had been suggested.",
        "The Magician, greatly delighted, begged her to allow the wedding to\ntake place as soon as possible.",
        "But she told him that before she married him he must allow her a little\nmore time, in which she might make his acquaintance, and that, after\nbeing enemies so long, their friendship could but strengthen by\ndegrees. “And do tell me,” she said, “are you quite immortal? Can death\nnever touch you? And are you too great an enchanter ever to feel human\nsuffering?”",
        "“Why do you ask?” said he.",
        "“Because,” she replied, “if I am to be your wife, I would fain know all\nabout you, in order, if any calamity threatens you, to overcome, or if\npossible to avert it.”",
        "“It is true,” he added, “that I am not as others. Far, far away,\nhundreds of thousands of miles from this, there lies a desolate country\ncovered with thick jungle. In the midst of the jungle grows a circle of\npalm trees, and in the centre of the circle stand six chattees full of\nwater, piled one above another: below the sixth chattee is a small cage\nwhich contains a little green parrot; on the life of the parrot depends\nmy life; and if the parrot is killed I must die. It is, however,” he\nadded, “impossible that the parrot should sustain any injury, both on\naccount of the inaccessibility of the country, and because, by my\nappointment, many thousand genii surround the palm trees, and kill all\nwho approach the place.”",
        "Balna told her son what Punchkin had said; but at the same time\nimplored him to give up all idea of getting the parrot.",
        "The Prince, however, replied, “Mother, unless I can get hold of that\nparrot, you, and my father, and uncles, cannot be liberated: be not\nafraid, I will shortly return. Do you, meantime, keep the Magician in\ngood humour–still putting off your marriage with him on various\npretexts; and before he finds out the cause of delay, I will be here.\"\nSo saying, he went away.",
        "Many, many weary miles did he travel, till at last he came to a thick\njungle; and, being very tired, sat down under a tree and fell asleep.\nHe was awakened by a soft rustling sound, and looking about him, saw a\nlarge serpent which was making its way to an eagle’s nest built in the\ntree under which he lay, and in the nest were two young eagles. The\nPrince seeing the danger of the young birds, drew his sword, and killed\nthe serpent; at the same moment a rushing sound was heard in the air,\nand the two old eagles, who had been out hunting for food for their\nyoung ones, returned. They quickly saw the dead serpent and the young\nPrince standing over it; and the old mother eagle said to him, “Dear\nboy, for many years all our young ones have been devoured by that cruel\nserpent; you have now saved the lives of our children; whenever you are\nin need, therefore, send to us and we will help you; and as for these\nlittle eagles, take them, and let them be your servants.”",
        "At this the Prince was very glad, and the two eaglets crossed their\nwings, on which he mounted; and they carried him far, far away over the\nthick jungles, until he came to the place where grew the circle of palm\ntrees, in the midst of which stood the six chattees full of water. It\nwas the middle of the day, and the heat was very great. All round the\ntrees were the genii fast asleep; nevertheless, there were such\ncountless thousands of them, that it would have been quite impossible\nfor any one to walk through their ranks to the place; down swooped the\nstrong-winged eaglets–down jumped the Prince; in an instant he had\noverthrown the six chattees full of water, and seized the little green\nparrot, which he rolled up in his cloak; while, as he mounted again\ninto the air, all the genii below awoke, and finding their treasure\ngone, set up a wild and melancholy howl.",
        "Away, away flew the little eagles, till they came to their home in the\ngreat tree; then the Prince said to the old eagles, “Take back your\nlittle ones; they have done me good service; if ever again I stand in\nneed of help, I will not fail to come to you.” He then continued his\njourney on foot till he arrived once more at the Magician’s palace,\nwhere he sat down at the door and began playing with the parrot.\nPunchkin saw him, and came to him quickly, and said, “My boy, where did\nyou get that parrot? Give it to me, I pray you.”",
        "But the Prince answered, “Oh no, I cannot give away my parrot, it is a\ngreat pet of mine; I have had it many years.”",
        "Then the Magician said, “If it is an old favourite, I can understand\nyour not caring to give it away; but come what will you sell it for?”",
        "“Sir,” replied the Prince, “I will not sell my parrot.”",
        "Then Punchkin got frightened, and said, “Anything, anything; name what\nprice you will, and it shall be yours.” The Prince answered, “Let the\nseven Raja’s sons whom you turned into rocks and trees be instantly\nliberated.”",
        "“It is done as you desire,” said the Magician, “only give me my\nparrot.” And with that, by a stroke of his wand, Balna’s husband and\nhis brothers resumed their natural shapes. “Now, give me my parrot,\"\nrepeated Punchkin.",
        "“Not so fast, my master,” rejoined the Prince; “I must first beg that\nyou will restore to life all whom you have thus imprisoned.”",
        "The Magician immediately waved his wand again; and, whilst he cried, in\nan imploring voice, “Give me my parrot!” the whole garden became\nsuddenly alive: where rocks, and stones, and trees had been before,\nstood Rajas, and Punts, and Sirdars, and mighty men on prancing horses,\nand jewelled pages, and troops of armed attendants.",
        "“Give me my parrot!” cried Punchkin. Then the boy took hold of the\nparrot, and tore off one of its wings; and as he did so the Magician’s\nright arm fell off.",
        "Punchkin then stretched out his left arm, crying, “Give me my parrot!\"\nThe Prince pulled off the parrot’s second wing, and the Magician’s left\narm tumbled off.",
        "“Give me my parrot!” cried he, and fell on his knees. The Prince pulled\noff the parrot’s right leg, the Magician’s right leg fell off: the\nPrince pulled off the parrot’s left leg, down fell the Magician’s left.",
        "Nothing remained of him save the limbless body and the head; but still\nhe rolled his eyes, and cried, “Give me my parrot!” “Take your parrot,\nthen,” cried the boy, and with that he wrung the bird’s neck, and threw\nit at the Magician; and, as he did so, Punchkin’s head twisted round,\nand, with a fearful groan, he died!",
        "Then they let Balna out of the tower; and she, her son, and the seven\nPrinces went to their own country, and lived very happily ever\nafterwards. And as to the rest of the world, every one went to his own\nhouse.",
        "There lived in a certain place a Brahman, whose name was\nSvabhavakripana, which means “a born miser.” He had collected\na quantity of rice by begging, and after having dined off it, he filled a\npot with what was left over. He hung the pot on a peg on the wall,\nplaced his couch beneath, and looking intently at it all the night, he\nthought, “Ah, that pot is indeed brimful of rice. Now, if there should be\na famine, I should certainly make a hundred rupees by it. With this I\nshall buy a couple of goats. They will have young ones every six months,\nand thus I shall have a whole herd of goats. Then, with the goats, I\nshall buy cows. As soon as they have calved, I shall sell the calves.\nThen, with the calves, I shall buy buffaloes; with the buffaloes, mares.\nWhen the mares have foaled, I shall have plenty of horses; and when\nI sell them, plenty of gold. With that gold I shall get a house with four\nwings. And then a Brahman will come to my house, and will give me his\nbeautiful daughter, with a large dowry. She will have a son, and I shall\ncall him Somasarman. When he is old enough to be danced on his\nfather’s knee, I shall sit with a book at the back of the stable, and while\nI am reading, the boy will see me, jump from his mother’s lap, and run\ntowards me to be danced on my knee. He will come too near the\nhorse’s hoof, and, full of anger, I shall call to my wife, ’Take the baby;\ntake him!’ But she, distracted by some domestic work, does not hear me.\nThen I get up, and give her such a kick with my foot.” While he thought\nthis, he gave a kick with his foot, and broke the pot. All the rice fell\nover him, and made him quite white. Therefore, I say, “He who makes\nfoolish plans for the future will be white all over, like the father of\nSomasarman.”",
        "Once upon a time there lived seven brothers and a sister. The brothers\nwere married, but their wives did not do the cooking for the family. It\nwas done by their sister, who stopped at home to cook. The wives for\nthis reason bore their sister-in-law much ill-will, and at length they\ncombined together to oust her from the office of cook and general\nprovider, so that one of themselves might obtain it. They said, “She\ndoes not go out to the fields to work, but remains quietly at home, and\nyet she has not the meals ready at the proper time.” They then called\nupon their Bonga, and vowing vows unto him they secured his good-will\nand assistance; then they said to the Bonga, “At midday, when our\nsister-in-law goes to bring water, cause it thus to happen, that on\nseeing her pitcher, the water shall vanish, and again slowly re-appear.\nIn this way she will be delayed. Let the water not flow into her\npitcher, and you may keep the maiden as your own.”",
        "At noon when she went to bring water, it suddenly dried up before her,\nand she began to weep. Then after a while the water began slowly to\nrise. When it reached her ankles she tried to fill her pitcher, but it\nwould not go under the water. Being frightened she began to wail and\ncry to her brother:",
        "  “Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my ankles,\n  Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip.”",
        "The water continued to rise until it reached her knee, when she began\nto wail again:",
        "  “Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my knee,\n  Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip.”",
        "The water continued to rise, and when it reached her waist, she cried\nagain:",
        "  “Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my waist,\n  Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip.”",
        "The water still rose, and when it reached her neck she kept on crying:",
        "  “Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my neck,\n  Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip.”",
        "At length the water became so deep that she felt herself drowning, then\nshe cried aloud:",
        "  “Oh! my brother, the water measures a man’s height,\n  Oh! my brother, the pitcher begins to fill.”",
        "The pitcher filled with water, and along with it she sank and was\ndrowned. The Bonga then transformed her into a Bonga like himself, and\ncarried her off.",
        "After a time she re-appeared as a bamboo growing on the embankment of\nthe tank in which she had been drowned. When the bamboo had grown to an\nimmense size, a Jogi, who was in the habit of passing that way, seeing\nit, said to himself, “This will make a splendid fiddle.” So one day he\nbrought an axe to cut it down; but when he was about to begin, the\nbamboo called out, “Do not cut at the root, cut higher up.” When he\nlifted his axe to cut high up the stem, the bamboo cried out, “Do not\ncut near the top, cut at the root.” When the Jogi again prepared\nhimself to cut at the root as requested, the bamboo said, “Do not cut\nat the root, cut higher up;” and when he was about to cut higher up, it\nagain called out to him, “Do not cut high up, cut at the root.” The\nJogi by this time felt sure that a Bonga was trying to frighten him, so\nbecoming angry he cut down the bamboo at the root, and taking it away\nmade a fiddle out of it. The instrument had a superior tone and\ndelighted all who heard it. The Jogi carried it with him when he went\na-begging, and through the influence of its sweet music he returned\nhome every evening with a full wallet.",
        "He now and then visited, when on his rounds, the house of the Bonga\ngirl’s brothers, and the strains of the fiddle affected them greatly.\nSome of them were moved even to tears, for the fiddle seemed to wail as\none in bitter anguish. The elder brother wished to purchase it, and\noffered to support the Jogi for a whole year if he would consent to\npart with his wonderful instrument. The Jogi, however, knew its value,\nand refused to sell it.",
        "It so happened that the Jogi some time after went to the house of a\nvillage chief, and after playing a tune or two on his fiddle asked for\nsomething to eat. They offered to buy his fiddle and promised a high\nprice for it, but he refused to sell it, as his fiddle brought to him\nhis means of livelihood. When they saw that he was not to be prevailed\nupon, they gave him food and a plentiful supply of liquor. Of the\nlatter he drank so freely that he presently became intoxicated. While\nhe was in this condition, they took away his fiddle, and substituted\ntheir own old one for it. When the Jogi recovered, he missed his\ninstrument, and suspecting that it had been stolen asked them to return\nit to him. They denied having taken it, so he had to depart, leaving\nhis fiddle behind him. The chief’s son, being a musician, used to play\non the Jogi’s fiddle, and in his hands the music it gave forth\ndelighted the ears of all who heard it.",
        "When all the household were absent at their labours in the fields, the\nBonga girl used to come out of the bamboo fiddle, and prepared the\nfamily meal. Having eaten her own share, she placed that of the chief’s\nson under his bed, and covering it up to keep off the dust, re-entered\nthe fiddle. This happening every day, the other members of the\nhousehold thought that some girl friend of theirs was in this manner\nshowing her interest in the young man, so they did not trouble\nthemselves to find out how it came about. The young chief, however, was\ndetermined to watch, and see which of his girl friends was so attentive\nto his comfort. He said in his own mind, “I will catch her to-day, and\ngive her a sound beating; she is causing me to be ashamed before the\nothers.” So saying, he hid himself in a corner in a pile of firewood.\nIn a short time the girl came out of the bamboo fiddle, and began to\ndress her hair. Having completed her toilet, she cooked the meal of\nrice as usual, and having eaten some herself, she placed the young\nman’s portion under his bed, as before, and was about to enter the\nfiddle again, when he, running out from his hiding-place, caught her in\nhis arms. The Bonga girl exclaimed, “Fie! Fie! you may be a Dom, or you\nmay be a Hadi of some other caste with whom I cannot marry.” He said,\n\"No. But from to-day, you and I are one.” So they began lovingly to\nhold converse with each other. When the others returned home in the\nevening, they saw that she was both a human being and a Bonga, and they\nrejoiced exceedingly.",
        "Now in course of time the Bonga girl’s family became very poor, and her\nbrothers on one occasion came to the chief’s house on a visit.",
        "The Bonga girl recognised them at once, but they did not know who she\nwas. She brought them water on their arrival, and afterwards set cooked\nrice before them. Then sitting down near them, she began in wailing\ntones to upbraid them on account of the treatment she had been\nsubjected to by their wives. She related all that had befallen her, and\nwound up by saying, “You must have known it all, and yet you did not\ninterfere to save me.” And that was all the revenge she took.",
        "Long ago the Bodisat was born to a forest life as the Genius of a tree\nstanding near a certain lotus pond.",
        "Now at that time the water used to run short at the dry season in a\ncertain pond, not over large, in which there were a good many fish. And\na crane thought on seeing the fish.",
        "“I must outwit these fish somehow or other and make a prey of them.”",
        "And he went and sat down at the edge of the water, thinking how he\nshould do it.",
        "When the fish saw him, they asked him, “What are you sitting there for,\nlost in thought?”",
        "“I am sitting thinking about you,” said he.",
        "“Oh, sir! what are you thinking about us?” said they.",
        "“Why,” he replied; “there is very little water in this pond, and but\nlittle for you to eat; and the heat is so great! So I was thinking,\n’What in the world will these fish do now?’”",
        "“Yes, indeed, sir! what are we to do?” said they.",
        "“If you will only do as I bid you, I will take you in my beak to a fine\nlarge pond, covered with all the kinds of lotuses, and put you into\nit,” answered the crane.",
        "“That a crane should take thought for the fishes is a thing unheard of,\nsir, since the world began. It’s eating us, one after the other, that\nyou’re aiming at.”",
        "“Not I! So long as you trust me, I won’t eat you. But if you don’t\nbelieve me that there is such a pond, send one of you with me to go and\nsee it.”",
        "Then they trusted him, and handed over to him one of their number–a\nbig fellow, blind of one eye, whom they thought sharp enough in any\nemergency, afloat or ashore.",
        "Him the crane took with him, let him go in the pond, showed him the\nwhole of it, brought him back, and let him go again close to the other\nfish. And he told them all the glories of the pond.",
        "And when they heard what he said, they exclaimed, “All right, sir! You\nmay take us with you.”",
        "Then the crane took the old purblind fish first to the bank of the\nother pond, and alighted in a Varana-tree growing on the bank there.\nBut he threw it into a fork of the tree, struck it with his beak, and\nkilled it; and then ate its flesh, and threw its bones away at the foot\nof the tree. Then he went back and called out:",
        "“I’ve thrown that fish in; let another one come.”",
        "And in that manner he took all the fish, one by one, and ate them, till\nhe came back and found no more!",
        "But there was still a crab left behind there; and the crane thought he\nwould eat him too, and called out:",
        "“I say, good crab, I’ve taken all the fish away, and put them into a\nfine large pond. Come along. I’ll take you too!”",
        "“But how will you take hold of me to carry me along?”",
        "“I’ll bite hold of you with my beak.”",
        "“You’ll let me fall if you carry me like that. I won’t go with you!”",
        "“Don’t be afraid! I’ll hold you quite tight all the way.”",
        "Then said the crab to himself, “If this fellow once got hold of fish,\nhe would never let them go in a pond! Now if he should really put me\ninto the pond, it would be capital; but if he doesn’t–then I’ll cut\nhis throat, and kill him!” So he said to him:",
        "“Look here, friend, you won’t be able to hold me tight enough; but we\ncrabs have a famous grip. If you let me catch hold of you round the\nneck with my claws, I shall be glad to go with you.”",
        "And the other did not see that he was trying to outwit him, and agreed.\nSo the crab caught hold of his neck with his claws as securely as with\na pair of blacksmith’s pincers, and called out, “Off with you, now!”",
        "And the crane took him and showed him the pond, and then turned off\ntowards the Varana-tree.",
        "“Uncle!” cried the crab, “the pond lies that way, but you are taking me\nthis way!”",
        "“Oh, that’s it, is it?” answered the crane. “Your dear little uncle,\nyour very sweet nephew, you call me! You mean me to understand, I\nsuppose, that I am your slave, who has to lift you up and carry you\nabout with him! Now cast your eye upon the heap of fish-bones lying at\nthe root of yonder Varana-tree. Just as I have eaten those fish, every\none of them, just so I will devour you as well!”",
        "“Ah! those fishes got eaten through their own stupidity,” answered the\ncrab; “but I’m not going to let you eat me. On the contrary, is\nit you that I am going to destroy. For you in your folly have\nnot seen that I was outwitting you. If we die, we die both together;\nfor I will cut off this head of yours, and cast it to the ground!” And\nso saying, he gave the crane’s neck a grip with his claws, as with a\nvice.",
        "Then gasping, and with tears trickling from his eyes, and trembling\nwith the fear of death, the crane beseeched him, saying, “O my Lord!\nIndeed I did not intend to eat you. Grant me my life!”",
        "“Well, well! step down into the pond, and put me in there.”",
        "And he turned round and stepped down into the pond, and placed the crab\non the mud at its edge. But the crab cut through its neck as clean as\none would cut a lotus-stalk with a hunting-knife, and then only entered\nthe water!",
        "When the Genius who lived in the Varana-tree saw this strange affair,\nhe made the wood resound with his plaudits, uttering in a pleasant\nvoice the verse:",
        "  “The villain, though exceeding clever,\n  Shall prosper not by his villainy.\n  He may win indeed, sharp-witted in deceit,\n  But only as the Crane here from the Crab!”",
        "Once there was a king called King Dantal, who had a great many rupees\nand soldiers and horses. He had also an only son called Prince Majnun,\nwho was a handsome boy with white teeth, red lips, blue eyes, red\ncheeks, red hair, and a white skin. This boy was very fond of playing\nwith the Wazir’s son, Husain Mahamat, in King Dantal’s garden, which\nwas very large and full of delicious fruits, and flowers, and trees.\nThey used to take their little knives there and cut the fruits and eat\nthem. King Dantal had a teacher for them to teach them to read and\nwrite.",
        "One day, when they were grown two fine young men, Prince Majnun said to\nhis father, “Husain Mahamat and I should like to go and hunt.” His\nfather said they might go, so they got ready their horses and all else\nthey wanted for their hunting, and went to the Phalana country, hunting\nall the way, but they only founds jackals and birds.",
        "The Raja of the Phalana country was called Munsuk Raja, and he had a\ndaughter named Laili, who was very beautiful; she had brown eyes and\nblack hair.",
        "One night, some time before Prince Majnun came to her father’s kingdom,\nas she slept, Khuda sent to her an angel in the form of a man who told\nher that she should marry Prince Majnun and no one else, and that this\nwas Khuda’s command to her. When Laili woke she told her father of the\nangel’s visit to her as she slept; but her father paid no attention to\nher story. From that time she began repeating, “Majnun, Majnun; I want\nMajnun,” and would say nothing else. Even as she sat and ate her food\nshe kept saying, “Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun.” Her father used to\nget quite vexed with her. “Who is this Majnun? who ever heard of this\nMajnun?” he would say.",
        "“He is the man I am to marry,” said Laili. “Khuda has ordered me to\nmarry no one but Majnun.” And she was half mad.",
        "Meanwhile, Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to hunt in the Phalana\ncountry; and as they were riding about, Laili came out on her horse to\neat the air, and rode behind them. All the time she kept saying,\n\"Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun.” The prince heard her, and turned\nround. “Who is calling me?” he asked. At this Laili looked at him, and\nthe moment she saw him she fell deeply in love with him, and she said\nto herself, “I am sure that is the Prince Majnun that Khuda says I am\nto marry.” And she went home to her father and said, “Father, I wish to\nmarry the prince who has come to your kingdom; for I know he is the\nPrince Majnun I am to marry.”",
        "“Very well, you shall have him for your husband,” said Munsuk Raja. “We\nwill ask him to-morrow.” Laili consented to wait, although she was very\nimpatient. As it happened, the prince left the Phalana kingdom that\nnight, and when Laili heard he was gone, she went quite mad. She would\nnot listen to a word her father, or her mother, or her servants said to\nher, but went off into the jungle, and wandered from jungle to jungle,\ntill she got farther and farther away from her own country. All the\ntime she kept saying, “Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun;” and so she\nwandered about for twelve years.",
        "At the end of the twelve years she met a fakir–he was really an angel,\nbut she did not know this–who asked her, “Why do you always say,\n’Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun’?” She answered, “I am the daughter of\nthe king of the Phalana country, and I want to find Prince Majnun; tell\nme where his kingdom is.”",
        "“I think you will never get there,” said the fakir, “for it is very far\nfrom hence, and you have to cross many rivers to reach it.” But Laili\nsaid she did not care; she must see Prince Majnun. “Well,” said the\nfakir, “when you come to the Bhagirathi river you will see a big fish,\na Rohu; and you must get him to carry you to Prince Majnun’s country,\nor you will never reach it.”",
        "She went on and on, and at last she came to the Bhagirathi river. There\nwas a great big fish called the Rohu fish. It was yawning just as she\ngot up to it, and she instantly jumped down its throat into its\nstomach. All the time she kept saying, “Majnun, Majnun.” At this the\nRohu fish was greatly alarmed and swam down the river as fast as he\ncould. By degrees he got tired and went slower, and a crow came and\nperched on his back, and said “Caw, caw.” “Oh, Mr. Crow,” said the poor\nfish “do see what is in my stomach that makes such a noise.”",
        "“Very well,” said the crow, “open your mouth wide, and I’ll fly down\nand see.”",
        "So the Rohu opened his jaws and the crow flew down, but he came up\nagain very quickly. “You have a Rakshas in your stomach,” said the\ncrow, and he flew away.",
        "This news did not comfort the poor Rohu, and he swam on and on till he\ncame to Prince Majnun’s country. There he stopped. And a jackal came\ndown to the river to drink. “Oh, jackal,” said the Rohu “do tell me\nwhat I have inside me.”",
        "“How can I tell?” said the jackal. “I cannot see unless I go inside\nyou.” So the Rohu opened his mouth wide, and the jackal jumped down his\nthroat; but he came up very quickly, looking much frightened and\nsaying, “You have a Rakshas in your stomach, and if I don’t run away\nquickly, I am afraid it will eat me.” So off he ran. After the jackal\ncame an enormous snake. “Oh,” says the fish, “do tell me what I have in\nmy stomach, for it rattles about so, and keeps saying, ’Majnun, Majnun;\nI want Majnun.’”",
        "The snake said, “Open your mouth wide, and I’ll go down and see what it\nis.” The snake went down: when he returned he said, “You have a Rakshas\nin your stomach, but if you will let me cut you open, it will come out\nof you.” “If you do that, I shall die,” said the Rohu. “Oh, no,” said\nthe snake, “you will not, for I will give you a medicine that will make\nyou quite well again.” So the fish agreed, and the snake got a knife\nand cut him open, and out jumped Laili.",
        "She was now very old. Twelve years she had wandered about the jungle,\nand for twelve years she had lived inside her Rohu; and she was no\nlonger beautiful, and had lost her teeth. The snake took her on his\nback and carried her into the country, and there he put her down, and\nshe wandered on and on till she got to Majnun’s court-house, where King\nMajnun was sitting. There some men heard her crying, “Majnun, Majnun; I\nwant Majnun,” and they asked her what she wanted. “I want King Majnun,\"\nshe said.",
        "So they went in and said to Prince Majnun, “An old woman outside says\nshe wants you.” “I cannot leave this place,” said he; “send her in\nhere.” They brought her in and the prince asked her what she wanted. “I\nwant to marry you,” she answered. “Twenty-four years ago you came to my\nfather the Phalana Raja’s country, and I wanted to marry you then; but\nyou went away without marrying me. Then I went mad, and I have wandered\nabout all these years looking for you.” Prince Majnun said, “Very\ngood.”",
        "“Pray to Khuda,” said Laili, “to make us both young again, and then we\nshall be married.” So the prince prayed to Khuda, and Khuda said to\nhim, “Touch Laili’s clothes and they will catch fire, and when they are\non fire, she and you will become young again.” When he touched Laili’s\nclothes they caught fire, and she and he became young again. And there\nwere great feasts, and they were married, and travelled to the Phalana\ncountry to see her father and mother.",
        "Now Laili’s father and mother had wept so much for their daughter that\nthey had become quite blind, and her father kept always repeating,\n\"Laili, Laili, Laili.” When Laili saw their blindness, she prayed to\nKhuda to restore their sight to them, which he did. As soon as the\nfather and mother saw Laili, they hugged her and kissed her, and then\nthey had the wedding all over again amid great rejoicings. Prince\nMajnum and Laili stayed with Munsuk Raja and his wife for three years,\nand then they returned to King Dantal, and lived happily for some time\nwith him. They used to go out hunting, and they often went from country\nto country to eat the air and amuse themselves.",
        "One day Prince Majnun said to Laili, “Let us go through this jungle.\"\n\"No, no,” said Laili; “if we go through this jungle, some harm will\nhappen to me.” But Prince Majnun laughed, and went into the jungle. And\nas they were going through it, Khuda thought, “I should like to know\nhow much Prince Majnun loves his wife. Would he be very sorry if she\ndied? And would he marry another wife? I will see.” So he sent one of\nhis angels in the form of a fakir into the jungle; and the angel went\nup to Laili, and threw some powder in her face, and instantly she fell\nto the ground a heap of ashes.",
        "Prince Majnun was in great sorrow and grief when he saw his dear Laili\nturned into a little heap of ashes; and he went straight home to his\nfather, and for a long, long time he would not be comforted. After a\ngreat many years he grew more cheerful and happy, and began to go again\ninto his father’s beautiful garden with Husain Mahamat. King Dantal\nwished his son to marry again. “I will only have Laili for my wife; I\nwill not marry any other woman,” said Prince Majnun.",
        "“How can you marry Laili? Laili is dead. She will never come back to\nyou,” said the father. “Then I’ll not have any wife at all,” said\nPrince Majnun.",
        "Meanwhile Laili was living in the jungle where her husband had left her\na little heap of ashes. As soon as Majnun had gone, the fakir had taken\nher ashes and made them quite clean, and then he had mixed clay and\nwater with the ashes, and made the figure of a woman with them, and so\nLaili regained her human form, and Khuda sent life into it. But Laili\nhad become once more a hideous old woman, with a long, long nose, and\nteeth like tusks; just such an old woman, excepting her teeth, as she\nhad been when she came out of the Rohu fish; and she lived in the\njungle, and neither ate nor drank, and she kept on saying, “Majnun,\nMajnun; I want Majnun.”",
        "At last the angel who had come as a fakir and thrown the powder at her,\nsaid to Khuda, “Of what use is it that this woman should sit in the\njungle crying, crying for ever, ’Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,’ and\neating and drinking nothing? Let me take her to Prince Majnun.” “Well,\"\nsaid Khuda, “you may do so; but tell her that she must not speak to\nMajnun if he is afraid of her when he sees her; and that if he is\nafraid when he sees her, she will become a little white dog the next\nday. Then she must go to the palace, and she will only regain her human\nshape when Prince Majnun loves her, feeds her with his own food, and\nlets her sleep in his bed.”",
        "So the angel came to Laili again as a fakir and carried her to King\nDantal’s garden. “Now,” he said, “it is Khuda’s command that you stay\nhere till Prince Majnun comes to walk in the garden, and then you may\nshow yourself to him. But you must not speak to him, if he is afraid of\nyou; and should he be afraid of you, you will the next day become a\nlittle white dog.” He then told her what she must do as a little dog to\nregain her human form.",
        "Laili stayed in the garden, hidden in the tall grass, till Prince\nMajnun and Husain Mahamat came to walk in the garden. King Dantal was\nnow a very old man, and Husain Mahamat, though he was really only as\nold as Prince Majnun, looked a great deal older than the prince, who\nhad been made quite young again when he married Laili.",
        "As Prince Majnun and the Wazir’s son walked in the garden, they\ngathered the fruit as they had done as little children, only they bit\nthe fruit with their teeth; they did not cut it. While Majnun was busy\neating a fruit in this way, and was talking to Husain Mahamat, he\nturned towards him and saw Laili walking behind the Wazir’s son.",
        "“Oh, look, look!” he cried, “see what is following you; it is a Rakshas\nor a demon, and I am sure it is going to eat us.” Laili looked at him\nbeseechingly with all her eyes, and trembled with age and eagerness;\nbut this only frightened Majnun the more. “It is a Rakshas, a Rakshas!\"\nhe cried, and he ran quickly to the palace with the Wazir’s son; and as\nthey ran away, Laili disappeared into the jungle. They ran to King\nDantal, and Majnun told him there was a Rakshas or a demon in the\ngarden that had come to eat them.",
        "“What nonsense,” said his father. “Fancy two grown men being so\nfrightened by an old ayah or a fakir! And if it had been a Rakshas, it\nwould not have eaten you.” Indeed King Dantal did not believe Majnun\nhad seen anything at all, till Husain Mahamat said the prince was\nspeaking the exact truth. They had the garden searched for the terrible\nold woman, but found nothing, and King Dantal told his son he was very\nsilly to be so much frightened. However, Prince Majnun would not walk\nin the garden any more.",
        "The next day Laili turned into a pretty little dog; and in this shape\nshe came into the palace, where Prince Majnun soon became very fond of\nher. She followed him everywhere, went with him when he was out\nhunting, and helped him to catch his game, and Prince Majnun fed her\nwith milk, or bread, or anything else he was eating, and at night the\nlittle dog slept in his bed.",
        "But one night the little dog disappeared, and in its stead there lay\nthe little old woman who had frightened him so much in the garden; and\nnow Prince Majnun was quite sure she was a Rakshas, or a demon, or some\nsuch horrible thing come to eat him; and in his terror he cried out,\n\"What do you want? Oh, do not eat me; do not eat me!” Poor Laili\nanswered, “Don’t you know me? I am your wife Laili, and I want to marry\nyou. Don’t you remember how you would go through that jungle, though I\nbegged and begged you not to go, for I told you that harm would happen\nto me, and then a fakir came and threw powder in my face, and I became\na heap of ashes. But Khuda gave me my life again, and brought me here,\nafter I had stayed a long, long while in the jungle crying for you, and\nnow I am obliged to be a little dog; but if you will marry me, I shall\nnot be a little dog any more.” Majnun, however, said “How can I marry\nan old woman like you? how can you be Laili? I am sure you are a\nRakshas or a demon come to eat me,” and he was in great terror.",
        "In the morning the old woman had turned into the little dog, and the\nprince went to his father and told him all that had happened. “An old\nwoman! an old woman! always an old woman!” said his father. “You do\nnothing but think of old women. How can a strong man like you be so\neasily frightened?” However, when he saw that his son was really in\ngreat terror, and that he really believed the old woman would came back\nat night, he advised him to say to her, “I will marry you if you can\nmake yourself a young girl again. How can I marry such an old woman as\nyou are?”",
        "That night as he lay trembling in bed the little old woman lay there in\nplace of the dog, crying “Majnun, Majnun, I want to marry you. I have\nloved you all these long, long years. When I was in my father’s kingdom\na young girl, I knew of you, though you knew nothing of me, and we\nshould have been married then if you had not gone away so suddenly, and\nfor long, long years I followed you.”",
        "“Well,” said Majnun, “if you can make yourself a young girl again, I\nwill marry you.”",
        "Laili said, “Oh, that is quite easy. Khuda will make me a young girl\nagain. In two days’ time you must go into the garden, and there you\nwill see a beautiful fruit. You must gather it and bring it into your\nroom and cut it open yourself very gently, and you must not open it\nwhen your father or anybody else is with you, but when you are quite\nalone; for I shall be in the fruit quite naked, without any clothes at\nall on.” In the morning Laili took her little dog’s form, and\ndisappeared in the garden.",
        "Prince Majnun told all this to his father, who told him to do all the\nold woman had bidden him. In two days’ time he and the Wazir’s son\nwalked in the garden, and there they saw a large, lovely red fruit.\n\"Oh!” said the Prince, “I wonder shall I find my wife in that fruit.\"\nHusain Mahamat wanted him to gather it and see, but he would not till\nhe had told his father, who said, “That must be the fruit; go and\ngather it.” So Majnun went back and broke the fruit off its stalk; and\nhe said to his father, “Come with me to my room while I open it; I am\nafraid to open it alone, for perhaps I shall find a Rakshas in it that\nwill eat me.”",
        "“No,” said King Dantal; “remember, Laili will be naked; you must go\nalone and do not be afraid if, after all, a Rakshas is in the fruit,\nfor I will stay outside the door, and you have only to call me with a\nloud voice, and I will come to you, so the Rakshas will not be able to\neat you.”",
        "Then Majnun took the fruit and began to cut it open tremblingly, for he\nshook with fear; and when he had cut it, out stepped Laili, young and\nfar more beautiful than she had ever been. At the sight of her extreme\nbeauty, Majnun fell backwards fainting on the floor.",
        "Laili took off his turban and wound it all round herself like a sari\n(for she had no clothes at all on), and then she called King Dantal,\nand said to him sadly, “Why has Majnun fallen down like this? Why will\nhe not speak to me? He never used to be afraid of me; and he has seen\nme so many, many times.”",
        "King Dantal answered, “It is because you are so beautiful. You are far,\nfar more beautiful than you ever were. But he will be very happy\ndirectly.” Then the King got some water, and they bathed Majnun’s face\nand gave him some to drink, and he sat up again.",
        "Then Laili said, “Why did you faint? Did you not see I am Laili?”",
        "“Oh!” said Prince Majnun, “I see you are Laili come back to me, but\nyour eyes have grown so wonderfully beautiful, that I fainted when I\nsaw them.” Then they were all very happy, and King Dantal had all the\ndrums in the place beaten, and had all the musical instruments played\non, and they made a grand wedding-feast, and gave presents to the\nservants, and rice and quantities of rupees to the fakirs.",
        "After some time had passed very happily, Prince Majnun and his wife\nwent out to eat the air. They rode on the same horse, and had only a\ngroom with them. They came to another kingdom, to a beautiful garden.\n\"We must go into that garden and see it,” said Majnun.",
        "“No, no,” said Laili; “it belongs to a bad Raja, Chumman Basa, a very\nwicked man.” But Majnun insisted on going in, and in spite of all Laili\ncould say, he got off the horse to look at the flowers. Now, as he was\nlooking at the flowers, Laili saw Chumman Basa coming towards them, and\nshe read in his eyes that he meant to kill her husband and seize her.\nSo she said to Majnun, “Come, come, let us go; do not go near that bad\nman. I see in his eyes, and I feel in my heart, that he will kill you\nto seize me.”",
        "“What nonsense,” said Majnun. “I believe he is a very good Raja.\nAnyhow, I am so near to him that I could not get away.”",
        "“Well,” said Laili, “it is better that you should be killed than I, for\nif I were to be killed a second time, Khuda would not give me my life\nagain; but I can bring you to life if you are killed.” Now Chumman Basa\nhad come quite near, and seemed very pleasant, so thought Prince\nMajnun; but when he was speaking to Majnun, he drew his scimitar and\ncut off the prince’s head at one blow.",
        "Laili sat quite still on her horse, and as the Raja came towards her\nshe said, “Why did you kill my husband?”",
        "“Because I want to take you,” he answered.",
        "“You cannot,” said Laili.",
        "“Yes, I can,” said the Raja.",
        "“Take me, then,” said Laili to Chumman Basa; so he came quite close and\nput out his hand to take hers to lift her off her horse. But she put\nher hand in her pocket and pulled out a tiny knife, only as long as her\nhand was broad, and this knife unfolded itself in one instant till it\nwas such a length! and then Laili made a great sweep with her arm and\nher long, long knife, and off came Chumman Basa’s head at one touch.",
        "Then Laili slipped down off her horse, and she went to Majnun’s dead\nbody, and she cut her little finger inside her hand straight down from\nthe top of her nail to her palm, and out of this gushed blood like\nhealing medicine. Then she put Majnun’s head on his shoulders, and\nsmeared her healing blood all over the wound, and Majnun woke up and\nsaid, “What a delightful sleep I have had! Why, I feel as if I had\nslept for years!” Then he got up and saw the Raja’s dead body by\nLaili’s horse.",
        "“What’s that?” said Majnun.",
        "“That is the wicked Raja who killed you to seize me, just as I said he\nwould.”",
        "“Who killed him?” asked Majnun.",
        "“I did,” answered Laili, “and it was I who brought you to life.”",
        "“Do bring the poor man to life if you know how to do so,” said Majnun.",
        "“No,” said Laili, “for he is a wicked man, and will try to do you\nharm.” But Majnun asked her for such a long time, and so earnestly to\nbring the wicked Raja to life, that at least she said, “Jump up on the\nhorse, then, and go far away with the groom.”",
        "“What will you do,” said Majnun, “if I leave you? I cannot leave you.”",
        "“I will take care of myself,” said Laili; “but this man is so wicked,\nhe may kill you again if you are near him.” So Majnun got up on the\nhorse, and he and the groom went a long way off and waited for Laili.\nThen she set the wicked Raja’s head straight on his shoulders, and she\nsqueezed the wound in her finger till a little blood-medicine came out\nof it. Then she smeared this over the place where her knife had passed,\nand just as she saw the Raja opening his eyes, she began to run, and\nshe ran, and ran so fast, that she outran the Raja, who tried to catch\nher; and she sprang up on the horse behind her husband, and they rode\nso fast, so fast, till they reached King Dantal’s palace.",
        "There Prince Majnun told everything to his father, who was horrified\nand angry. “How lucky for you that you have such a wife,” he said. “Why\ndid you not do what she told you? But for her, you would be now dead.\"\nThen he made a great feast out of gratitude for his son’s safety, and\ngave many, many rupees to the fakirs. And he made so much of Laili. He\nloved her dearly; he could not do enough for her. Then he built a\nsplendid palace for her and his son, with a great deal of ground about\nit, and lovely gardens, and gave them great wealth, and heaps of\nservants to wait on them. But he would not allow any but their servants\nto enter their gardens and palace, and he would not allow Majnun to go\nout of them, nor Laili; “for,” said King Dantal, “Laili is so\nbeautiful, that perhaps some one may kill my son to take her away.”",
        "Once upon a time, a tiger was caught in a trap. He tried in vain to get\nout through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when he\nfailed.",
        "By chance a poor Brahman came by. “Let me out of this cage, oh pious\none!” cried the tiger.",
        "“Nay, my friend,” replied the Brahman mildly, “you would probably eat\nme if I did.”",
        "“Not at all!” swore the tiger with many oaths; “on the contrary, I\nshould be for ever grateful, and serve you as a slave!”",
        "Now when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the pious\nBrahman’s heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door of\nthe cage. Out popped the tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried, “What\na fool you are! What is to prevent my eating you now, for after being\ncooped up so long I am just terribly hungry!”",
        "In vain the Brahman pleaded for his life; the most he could gain was a\npromise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose to\nquestion as to the justice of the tiger’s action.",
        "So the Brahman first asked a pipal tree what it thought of the\nmatter, but the pipal tree replied coldly, “What have you to\ncomplain about? Don’t I give shade and shelter to every one who passes\nby, and don’t they in return tear down my branches to feed their\ncattle? Don’t whimper–be a man!”",
        "Then the Brahman, sad at heart, went further afield till he saw a\nbuffalo turning a well-wheel; but he fared no better from it, for it\nanswered, “You are a fool to expect gratitude! Look at me! Whilst I\ngave milk they fed me on cotton-seed and oil-cake, but now I am dry\nthey yoke me here, and give me refuse as fodder!”",
        "The Brahman, still more sad, asked the road to give him its opinion.",
        "“My dear sir,” said the road, “how foolish you are to expect anything\nelse! Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, great and\nsmall, trample on me as they go past, giving me nothing but the ashes\nof their pipes and the husks of their grain!”",
        "On this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met a\njackal, who called out, “Why, what’s the matter, Mr. Brahman? You look\nas miserable as a fish out of water!”",
        "The Brahman told him all that had occurred. “How very confusing!” said\nthe jackal, when the recital was ended; “would you mind telling me over\nagain, for everything has got so mixed up?”",
        "The Brahman told it all over again, but the jackal shook his head in a\ndistracted sort of way, and still could not understand.",
        "“It’s very odd,” said he, sadly, “but it all seems to go in at one ear\nand out at the other! I will go to the place where it all happened, and\nthen perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment.”",
        "So they returned to the cage, by which the tiger was waiting for the\nBrahman, and sharpening his teeth and claws.",
        "“You’ve been away a long time!” growled the savage beast, “but now let\nus begin our dinner.”",
        "“Our dinner!” thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knocked\ntogether with fright; “what a remarkably delicate way of putting it!”",
        "“Give me five minutes, my lord!” he pleaded, “in order that I may\nexplain matters to the jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits.”",
        "The tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again,\nnot missing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible.",
        "“Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor brain!” cried the jackal, wringing its\npaws. “Let me see! how did it all begin? You were in the cage, and the\ntiger came walking by–”",
        "“Pooh!” interrupted the tiger, “what a fool you are! I was in\nthe cage.”",
        "“Of course!” cried the jackal, pretending to tremble with fright; “yes!\nI was in the cage–no I wasn’t–dear! dear! where are my wits? Let me\nsee–the tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage came walking by–no,\nthat’s not it, either! Well, don’t mind me, but begin your dinner, for\nI shall never understand!”",
        "“Yes, you shall!” returned the tiger, in a rage at the jackal’s\nstupidity; “I’ll make you understand! Look here–I am the\ntiger–”",
        "“Yes, my lord!”",
        "“And that is the Brahman–”",
        "“Yes, my lord!”",
        "“And that is the cage–”",
        "“Yes, my lord!”",
        "“And I was in the cage–do you understand?”",
        "“Yes–no–Please, my lord–”",
        "“Well?” cried the tiger impatiently.",
        "“Please, my lord!–how did you get in?”",
        "“How!–why in the usual way, of course!”",
        "“Oh, dear me!–my head is beginning to whirl again! Please don’t be\nangry, my lord, but what is the usual way?”",
        "At this the tiger lost patience, and, jumping into the cage, cried,\n\"This way! Now do you understand how it was?”",
        "“Perfectly!” grinned the jackal, as he dexterously shut the door, “and\nif you will permit me to say so, I think matters will remain as they\nwere!”",
        "A soothsayer when on his deathbed wrote out the horoscope of his second\nson, whose name was Gangazara, and bequeathed it to him as his only\nproperty, leaving the whole of his estate to his eldest son. The second\nson thought over the horoscope, and said to himself:",
        "“Alas! am I born to this only in the world? The sayings of my father\nnever failed. I have seen them prove true to the last word while he was\nliving; and how has he fixed my horoscope! ’FROM MY BIRTH POVERTY!’ Nor\nis that my only fate. ’FOR TEN YEARS, IMPRISONMENT’–a fate harder than\npoverty; and what comes next? ’DEATH ON THE SEA-SHORE’; which means\nthat I must die away from home, far from friends and relatives on a\nsea-coast. Now comes the most curious part of the horoscope, that I am\nto ’HAVE SOME HAPPINESS AFTERWARDS!’ What this happiness is, is an\nenigma to me.”",
        "Thus thought he, and after all the funeral obsequies of his father were\nover, took leave of his elder brother, and started for Benares. He went\nby the middle of the Deccan, avoiding both the coasts, and went on\njourneying and journeying for weeks and months, till at last he reached\nthe Vindhya mountains. While passing that desert he had to journey for\na couple of days through a sandy plain, with no signs of life or\nvegetation. The little store of provision with which he was provided\nfor a couple of days, at last was exhausted. The chombu, which he\ncarried always full, filling it with the sweet water from the flowing\nrivulet or plenteous tank, he had exhausted in the heat of the desert.\nThere was not a morsel in his hand to eat; nor a drop of water to\ndrink. Turn his eyes wherever he might he found a vast desert, out of\nwhich he saw no means of escape. Still he thought within himself,\n\"Surely my father’s prophecy never proved untrue. I must survive this\ncalamity to find my death on some sea-coast.” So thought he, and this\nthought gave him strength of mind to walk fast and try to find a drop\nof water somewhere to slake his dry throat.",
        "At last he succeeded; heaven threw in his way a ruined well. He thought\nhe could collect some water if he let down his chombu with the string\nthat he always carried noosed to the neck of it. Accordingly he let it\ndown; it went some way and stopped, and the following words came from\nthe well: “Oh, relieve me! I am the king of tigers, dying here of\nhunger. For the last three days I have had nothing. Fortune has sent\nyou here. If you assist me now you will find a sure help in me\nthroughout your life. Do not think that I am a beast of prey. When you\nhave become my deliverer I will never touch you. Pray, kindly lift me\nup.” Gangazara thought: “Shall I take him out or not? If I take him out\nhe may make me the first morsel of his hungry mouth. No; that he will\nnot do. For my father’s prophecy never came untrue. I must die on a sea\ncoast, and not by a tiger.” Thus thinking, he asked the tiger-king to\nhold tight to the vessel, which he accordingly did, and he lifted him\nup slowly. The tiger reached the top of the well and felt himself on\nsafe ground. True to his word, he did no harm to Gangazara. On the\nother hand, he walked round his patron three times, and standing before\nhim, humbly spoke the following words: “My life-giver, my benefactor!\nI shall never forget this day, when I regained my life through your\nkind hands. In return for this kind assistance I pledge my oath to\nstand by you in all calamities. Whenever you are in any difficulty\njust think of me. I am there with you ready to oblige you by all the\nmeans that I can. To tell you briefly how I came in here: Three days\nago I was roaming in yonder forest, when I saw a goldsmith passing\nthrough it. I chased him. He, finding it impossible to escape my claws,\njumped into this well, and is living to this moment in the very bottom\nof it. I also jumped in, but found myself on the first ledge of the\nwell; he is on the last and fourth ledge. In the second lives a serpent\nhalf-famished with hunger. On the third lies a rat, also half-famished,\nand when you again begin to draw water these may request you first to\nrelease them. In the same way the goldsmith also may ask you. I beg\nyou, as your bosom friend, never assist that wretched man, though he is\nyour relation as a human being. Goldsmiths are never to be trusted. You\ncan place more faith in me, a tiger, though I feast sometimes upon men,\nin a serpent, whose sting makes your blood cold the very next moment,\nor in a rat, which does a thousand pieces of mischief in your house.\nBut never trust a goldsmith. Do not release him; and if you do, you\nshall surely repent of it one day or other.” Thus advising, the hungry\ntiger went away without waiting for an answer.",
        "Gangazara thought several times of the eloquent way in which the tiger\nspoke, and admired his fluency of speech. But still his thirst was not\nquenched. So he let down his vessel again, which was now caught hold of\nby the serpent, who addressed him thus: “Oh, my protector! Lift me up.\nI am the king of serpents, and the son of Adisesha, who is now pining\naway in agony for my disappearance. Release me now. I shall ever remain\nyour servant, remember your assistance, and help you throughout life in\nall possible ways. Oblige me: I am dying.” Gangazara, calling again to\nmind the “DEATH ON THE SEA-SHORE” of the prophecy lifted him up. He,\nlike the tiger-king, walked round him thrice, and prostrating himself\nbefore him spoke thus: “Oh, my life-giver, my father, for so I must\ncall you, as you have given me another birth. I was three days ago\nbasking myself in the morning sun, when I saw a rat running before me.\nI chased him. He fell into this well. I followed him, but instead of\nfalling on the third storey where he is now lying, I fell into the\nsecond. I am going away now to see my father. Whenever you are in any\ndifficulty just think of me. I will be there by your side to assist you\nby all possible means.” So saying, the Nagaraja glided away in zigzag\nmovements, and was out of sight in a moment.",
        "The poor son of the Soothsayer, who was now almost dying of thirst, let\ndown his vessel for a third time. The rat caught hold of it, and\nwithout discussing he lifted up the poor animal at once. But it would\nnot go away without showing its gratitude: “Oh, life of my life! My\nbenefactor! I am the king of rats. Whenever you are in any calamity\njust think of me. I will come to you, and assist you. My keen ears\noverheard all that the tiger-king told you about the goldsmith, who is\nin the fourth storey. It is nothing but a sad truth that goldsmiths\nought never to be trusted. Therefore, never assist him as you have done\nto us all. And if you do, you will suffer for it. I am hungry; let me\ngo for the present.” Thus taking leave of his benefactor, the rat, too,\nran away.",
        "Gangazara for a while thought upon the repeated advice given by the\nthree animals about releasing the goldsmith: “What wrong would there be\nin my assisting him? Why should I not release him also?” So thinking to\nhimself, Gangazara let down the vessel again. The goldsmith caught hold\nof it, and demanded help. The Soothsayer’s son had no time to lose; he\nwas himself dying of thirst.",
        "Therefore he lifted the goldsmith up, who now began his story. “Stop\nfor a while,” said Gangazara, and after quenching his thirst by letting\ndown his vessel for the fifth time, still fearing that some one might\nremain in the well and demand his assistance, he listened to the\ngoldsmith, who began as follows: “My dear friend, my protector, what a\ndeal of nonsense these brutes have been talking to you about me; I am\nglad you have not followed their advice. I am just now dying of hunger.\nPermit me to go away. My name is Manikkasari. I live in the East main\nstreet of Ujjaini, which is twenty kas to the south of this place, and\nso lies on your way when you return from Benares. Do not forget to come\nto me and receive my kind remembrances of your assistance, on your way\nback to your country.” So saying, the goldsmith took his leave, and\nGangazara also pursued his way north after the above adventures.",
        "He reached Benares, and lived there for more than ten years, and quite\nforgot the tiger, serpent, rat, and goldsmith. After ten years of\nreligious life, thoughts of home and of his brother rushed into his\nmind. “I have secured enough merit now by my religious observances. Let\nme return home.” Thus thought Gangazara within himself, and very soon\nhe was on his way back to his country. Remembering the prophecy of his\nfather he returned by the same way by which he went to Benares ten\nyears before. While thus retracing his steps he reached the ruined well\nwhere he had released the three brute kings and the gold smith. At once\nthe old recollections rushed into his mind, and he thought of the tiger\nto test his fidelity. Only a moment passed, and the tiger-king came\nrunning before him carrying a large crown in his mouth, the glitter of\nthe diamonds of which for a time outshone even the bright rays of the\nsun. He dropped the crown at his life-giver’s feet, and, putting aside\nall his pride, humbled himself like a pet cat to the strokes of his\nprotector, and began in the following words: “My life-giver! How is it\nthat you have forgotten me, your poor servant, for such a long time? I\nam glad to find that I still occupy a corner in your mind. I can never\nforget the day when I owed my life to your lotus hands. I have several\njewels with me of little value. This crown, being the best of all, I\nhave brought here as a single ornament of great value, which you can\ncarry with you and dispose of in your own country.” Gangazara looked at\nthe crown, examined it over and over, counted and recounted the gems,\nand thought within himself that he would become the richest of men by\nseparating the diamonds and gold, and selling them in his own country.\nHe took leave of the tiger-king, and after his disappearance thought of\nthe kings of serpents and rats, who came in their turn with their\npresents, and after the usual greetings and exchange of words took\ntheir leave. Gangazara was extremely delighted at the faithfulness with\nwhich the brute beasts behaved, and went on his way to the south. While\ngoing along he spoke to himself thus: “These beasts have been very\nfaithful in their assistance. Much more, therefore, must Manikkasari be\nfaithful. I do not want anything from him now. If I take this crown\nwith me as it is, it occupies much space in my bundle. It may also\nexcite the curiosity of some robbers on the way. I will go now to\nUjjaini on my way. Manikkasari requested me to see him without failure\non my return journey. I shall do so, and request him to have the crown\nmelted, the diamonds and gold separated. He must do that kindness at\nleast for me. I shall then roll up these diamonds and gold ball in my\nrags, and wend my way homewards.” Thus thinking and thinking, he\nreached Ujjaini. At once he inquired for the house of his goldsmith\nfriend, and found him without difficulty. Manikkasari was extremely\ndelighted to find on his threshold him who ten years before,\nnotwithstanding the advice repeatedly given him by the sage-looking\ntiger, serpent, and rat, had relieved him from the pit of death.\nGangazara at once showed him the crown that he received from the tiger-\nking, told him how he got it, and requested his kind assistance to\nseparate the gold and diamonds. Manikkasari agreed to do so, and\nmeanwhile asked his friend to rest himself for a while to have his bath\nand meals; and Gangazara, who was very observant of his religious\nceremonies, went direct to the river to bathe.",
        "How came the crown in the jaws of the tiger? The king of Ujjaini had a\nweek before gone with all his hunters on a hunting expedition. All of a\nsudden the tiger-king started from the wood, seized the king, and\nvanished.",
        "When the king’s attendants informed the prince about the death of his\nfather he wept and wailed, and gave notice that he would give half of\nhis kingdom to any one who should bring him news about the murderer of\nhis father. The goldsmith knew full well that it was a tiger that\nkilled the king, and not any hunter’s hands, since he had heard from\nGangazara how he obtained the crown. Still, he resolved to denounce\nGangazara as the king’s murderer, so, hiding the crown under his\ngarments, he flew to the palace. He went before the prince and informed\nhim that the assassin was caught, and placed the crown before him.",
        "The prince took it into his hands, examined it, and at once gave half\nthe kingdom to Manikkasari, and then inquired about the murderer. “He\nis bathing in the river, and is of such and such appearance,” was the\nreply. At once four armed soldiers flew to the river, and bound the\npoor Brahman hand and foot, while he, sitting in meditation, was\nwithout any knowledge of the fate that hung over him. They brought\nGangazara to the presence of the prince, who turned his face away from\nthe supposed murderer, and asked his soldiers to throw him into a\ndungeon. In a minute, without knowing the cause, the poor Brahman found\nhimself in the dark dungeon.",
        "It was a dark cellar underground, built with strong stone walls, into\nwhich any criminal guilty of a capital offence was ushered to breathe\nhis last there without food and drink. Such was the cellar into which\nGangazara was thrust. What were his thoughts when he reached that\nplace? “It is of no use to accuse either the goldsmith or the prince\nnow. We are all the children of fate. We must obey her commands. This\nis but the first day of my father’s prophecy. So far his statement is\ntrue. But how am I going to pass ten years here? Perhaps without\nanything to sustain life I may drag on my existence for a day or two.\nBut how pass ten years? That cannot be, and I must die. Before death\ncomes let me think of my faithful brute friends.”",
        "So pondered Gangazara in the dark cell underground, and at that moment\nthought of his three friends. The tiger-king, serpent-king, and rat-\nking assembled at once with their armies at a garden near the dungeon,\nand for a while did not know what to do. They held their council, and\ndecided to make an underground passage from the inside of a ruined well\nto the dungeon. The rat raja issued an order at once to that effect to\nhis army. They, with their teeth, bored the ground a long way to the\nwalls of the prison. After reaching it they found that their teeth\ncould not work on the hard stones. The bandicoots were then specially\nordered for the business; they, with their hard teeth, made a small\nslit in the wall for a rat to pass and re-pass without difficulty. Thus\na passage was effected.",
        "The rat raja entered first to condole with his protector on his\nmisfortune, and undertook to supply his protector with provisions.\n\"Whatever sweetmeats or bread are prepared in any house, one and all of\nyou must try to bring whatever you can to our benefactor. Whatever\nclothes you find hanging in a house, cut down, dip the pieces in water,\nand bring the wet bits to our benefactor. He will squeeze them and\ngather water for drink! and the bread and sweetmeats shall form his\nfood.” Having issued these orders, the king of the rats took leave of\nGangazara. They, in obedience to their king’s order, continued to\nsupply him with provisions and water.",
        "The snake-king said: “I sincerely condole with you in your calamity;\nthe tiger-king also fully sympathises with you, and wants me to tell\nyou so, as he cannot drag his huge body here as we have done with our\nsmall ones. The king of the rats has promised to do his best to provide\nyou with food. We would now do what we can for your release. From this\nday we shall issue orders to our armies to oppress all the subjects of\nthis kingdom. The deaths by snake-bite and tigers shall increase a\nhundredfold from this day, and day by day it shall continue to increase\ntill your release. Whenever you hear people near you, you had better\nbawl out so as to be heard by them: ’The wretched prince imprisoned me\non the false charge of having killed his father, while it was a tiger\nthat killed him. From that day these calamities have broken out in his\ndominions. If I were released I would save all by my powers of healing\npoisonous wounds and by incantations.’ Some one may report this to the\nking, and if he knows it, you will obtain your liberty.” Thus\ncomforting his protector in trouble, he advised him to pluck up\ncourage, and took leave of him. From that day tigers and serpents,\nacting under the orders of their kings, united in killing as many\npersons and cattle as possible. Every day people were carried away by\ntigers or bitten by serpents. Thus passed months and years. Gangazara\nsat in the dark cellar, without the sun’s light falling upon him, and\nfeasted upon the breadcrumbs and sweetmeats that the rats so kindly\nsupplied him with. These delicacies had completely changed his body\ninto a red, stout, huge, unwieldy mass of flesh. Thus passed full ten\nyears, as prophesied in the horoscope.",
        "Ten complete years rolled away in close imprisonment. On the last\nevening of the tenth year one of the serpents got into the bed-chamber\nof the princess and sucked her life. She breathed her last. She was the\nonly daughter of the king. The king at once sent for all the snake-bite\ncurers. He promised half his kingdom and his daughter’s hand to him who\nwould restore her to life. Now a servant of the king who had several\ntimes overheard Gangazara’s cries, reported the matter to him. The king\nat once ordered the cell to be examined. There was the man sitting in\nit. How had he managed to live so long in the cell? Some whispered that\nhe must be a divine being. Thus they discussed, while they brought\nGangazara to the king.",
        "The king no sooner saw Gangazara than he fell on the ground. He was\nstruck by the majesty and grandeur of his person. His ten years’\nimprisonment in the deep cell underground had given a sort of lustre to\nhis body. His hair had first to be cut before his face could be seen.\nThe king begged forgiveness for his former fault, and requested him to\nrevive his daughter.",
        "“Bring me within an hour all the corpses of men and cattle, dying and\ndead, that remain unburnt or unburied within the range of your\ndominions; I shall revive them all,” were the only words that Gangazara\nspoke.",
        "Cartloads of corpses of men and cattle began to come in every minute.\nEven graves, it is said, were broken open, and corpses buried a day or\ntwo before were taken out and sent for their revival. As soon as all\nwere ready, Gangazara took a vessel full of water and sprinkled it over\nthem all, thinking only of his snake-king and tiger-king. All rose up\nas if from deep slumber, and went to their respective homes. The\nprincess, too, was restored to life. The joy of the king knew no\nbounds. He cursed the day on which he imprisoned him, blamed himself\nfor having believed the word of a goldsmith, and offered him the hand\nof his daughter and the whole kingdom, instead of half, as he promised.\nGangazara would not accept anything, but asked the king to assemble all\nhis subjects in a wood near the town. “I shall there call in all the\ntigers and serpents, and give them a general order.”",
        "When the whole town was assembled, just at the dusk of evening,\nGangazara sat dumb for a moment, and thought upon the Tiger King and\nthe Serpent King, who came with all their armies. People began to take\nto their heels at the sight of tigers. Gangazara assured them of\nsafety, and stopped them.",
        "The grey light of the evening, the pumpkin colour of Gangazara, the\nholy ashes scattered lavishly over his body, the tigers and snakes\nhumbling themselves at his feet, gave him the true majesty of the god\nGangazara. For who else by a single word could thus command vast armies\nof tigers and serpents, said some among the people. “Care not for it;\nit may be by magic. That is not a great thing. That he revived\ncartloads of corpses shows him to be surely Gangazara,” said others.",
        "“Why should you, my children, thus trouble these poor subjects of\nUjjaini? Reply to me, and henceforth desist from your ravages.” Thus\nsaid the Soothsayer’s son, and the following reply came from the king\nof the tigers: “Why should this base king imprison your honour,\nbelieving the mere word of a goldsmith that your honour killed his\nfather? All the hunters told him that his father was carried away by a\ntiger. I was the messenger of death sent to deal the blow on his neck.\nI did it, and gave the crown to your honour. The prince makes no\ninquiry, and at once imprisons your honour. How can we expect justice\nfrom such a stupid king as that? Unless he adopt a better standard of\njustice we will go on with our destruction.”",
        "The king heard, cursed the day on which he believed in the word of a\ngoldsmith, beat his head, tore his hair, wept and wailed for his crime,\nasked a thousand pardons, and swore to rule in a just way from that\nday. The serpent-king and tiger-king also promised to observe their\noath as long as justice prevailed, and took their leave. The gold-smith\nfled for his life. He was caught by the soldiers of the king, and was\npardoned by the generous Gangazara, whose voice now reigned supreme.\nAll returned to their homes. The king again pressed Gangazara to accept\nthe hand of his daughter. He agreed to do so, not then, but some time\nafterwards. He wished to go and see his elder brother first, and then\nto return and marry the princess. The king agreed; and Gangazara left\nthe city that very day on his way home.",
        "It so happened that unwittingly he took a wrong road, and had to pass\nnear a sea-coast. His elder brother was also on his way up to Benares\nby that very same route. They met and recognised each other, even at a\ndistance. They flew into each other’s arms. Both remained still for a\ntime almost unconscious with joy. The pleasure of Gangazara was so\ngreat that he died of joy.",
        "The elder brother was a devout worshipper of Ganesa. That was a Friday,\na day very sacred to that god. The elder brother took the corpse to the\nnearest Ganesa temple and called upon him. The god came, and asked him\nwhat he wanted. “My poor brother is dead and gone; and this is his\ncorpse. Kindly keep it in your charge till I finish worshipping you. If\nI leave it anywhere else the devils may snatch it away when I am absent\nworshipping you; after finishing the rites I shall burn him.” Thus said\nthe elder brother, and, giving the corpse to the god Ganesa, he went to\nprepare himself for that deity’s ceremonials. Ganesa made over the\ncorpse to his Ganas, asking them to watch over it carefully. But\ninstead of that they devoured it.",
        "The elder brother, after finishing the puja, demanded his brother’s\ncorpse of the god. The god called his Ganas, who came to the front\nblinking, and fearing the anger of their master. The god was greatly\nenraged. The elder brother was very angry. When the corpse was not\nforthcoming he cuttingly remarked, “Is this, after all, the return for\nmy deep belief in you? You are unable even to return my brother’s\ncorpse.” Ganesa was much ashamed at the remark. So he, by his divine\npower, gave him a living Gangazara instead of the dead corpse. Thus was\nthe second son of the Soothsayer restored to life.",
        "The brothers had a long talk about each other’s adventures. They both\nwent to Ujjaini, where Gangazara married the princess, and succeeded to\nthe throne of that kingdom. He reigned for a long time, conferring\nseveral benefits upon his brother. And so the horoscope was fully\nfulfilled.",
        "There was a certain Brahman in a certain village, named Harisarman. He\nwas poor and foolish and in evil case for want of employment, and he\nhad very many children, that he might reap the fruit of his misdeeds in\na former life. He wandered about begging with his family, and at last\nhe reached a certain city, and entered the service of a rich\nhouseholder called Sthuladatta. His sons became keepers of\nSthuladatta’s cows and other property, and his wife a servant to him,\nand he himself lived near his house, performing the duty of an\nattendant. One day there was a feast on account of the marriage of the\ndaughter of Sthuladatta, largely attended by many friends of the bride-\ngroom, and merry-makers. Harisarman hoped that he would be able to fill\nhimself up to the throat with ghee and flesh and other dainties, and\nget the same for his family, in the house of his patron. While he was\nanxiously expecting to be fed, no one thought of him.",
        "Then he was distressed at getting nothing to eat, and he said to his\nwife at night, “It is owing to my poverty and stupidity that I am\ntreated with such disrespect here; so I will pretend by means of an\nartifice to possess a knowledge of magic, so that I may become an\nobject of respect to this Sthuladatta; so, when you get an opportunity,\ntell him that I possess magical knowledge.” He said this to her, and\nafter turning the matter over in his mind, while people were asleep he\ntook away from the house of Sthuladatta a horse on which his master’s\nson-in-law rode. He placed it in concealment at some distance, and in\nthe morning the friends of the bridegroom could not find the horse,\nthough they searched in every direction. Then, while Sthuladatta was\ndistressed at the evil omen, and searching for the thieves who had\ncarried off the horse, the wife of Harisarman came and said to him,\n\"My husband is a wise man, skilled in astrology and magical sciences;\nhe can get the horse back for you; why do you not ask him?”",
        "When Sthuladatta heard that, he called Harisarman, who said, “Yesterday\nI was forgotten, but to-day, now the horse is stolen, I am called to\nmind,” and Sthuladatta then propitiated the Brahman with these words–\n\"I forgot you, forgive me\"–and asked him to tell him who had taken\naway their horse. Then Harisarman drew all kinds of pretended diagrams,\nand said: “The horse has been placed by thieves on the boundary line\nsouth from this place. It is concealed there, and before it is carried\noff to a distance, as it will be at close of day, go quickly and bring\nit.” When they heard that, many men ran and brought the horse quickly,\npraising the discernment of Harisarman. Then Harisarman was honoured by\nall men as a sage, and dwelt there in happiness, honoured by\nSthuladatta.",
        "Now, as days went on, much treasure, both of gold and jewels, had been\nstolen by a thief from the palace of the king. As the thief was not\nknown, the king quickly summoned Harisarman on account of his\nreputation for knowledge of magic. And he, when summoned, tried to gain\ntime, and said, “I will tell you to-morrow,” and then he was placed in\na chamber by the king, and carefully guarded. And he was sad because he\nhad pretended to have knowledge. Now in that palace there was a maid\nnamed Jihva (which means Tongue), who, with the assistance of her\nbrother, had stolen that treasure from the interior of the palace. She,\nbeing alarmed at Harisarman’s knowledge, went at night and applied her\near to the door of that chamber in order to find out what he was about.\nAnd Harisarman, who was alone inside, was at that very moment blaming\nhis own tongue, that had made a vain assumption of knowledge. He said:\n\"O Tongue, what is this that you have done through your greediness?\nWicked one, you will soon receive punishment in full.” When Jihva heard\nthis, she thought, in her terror, that she had been discovered by this\nwise man, and she managed to get in where he was, and falling at his\nfeet, she said to the supposed wizard: “Brahman, here I am, that Jihva\nwhom you have discovered to be the thief of the treasure, and after I\ntook it I buried it in the earth in a garden behind the palace, under a\npomegranate tree. So spare me, and receive the small quantity of gold\nwhich is in my possession.”",
        "When Harisarman heard that, he said to her proudly: “Depart, I know all\nthis; I know the past, present and future; but I will not denounce you,\nbeing a miserable creature that has implored my protection. But\nwhatever gold is in your possession you must give back to me.” When he\nsaid this to the maid, she consented, and departed quickly. But\nHarisarman reflected in his astonishment: “Fate brings about, as if in\nsport, things impossible, for when calamity was so near, who would have\nthought chance would have brought us success? While I was blaming my\njihva, the thief Jihva suddenly flung herself at my feet. Secret crimes\nmanifest themselves by means of fear.” Thus thinking, he passed the\nnight happily in the chamber. And in the morning he brought the king,\nby some skilful parade of pretended knowledge into the garden, and led\nhim up to the treasure, which was buried under the pomegranate tree,\nand said that the thief had escaped with a part of it. Then the king\nwas pleased, and gave him the revenue of many villages.",
        "But the minister, named Devajnanin, whispered in the king’s ear: “How\ncan a man possess such knowledge unattainable by men, without having\nstudied the books of magic; you may be certain that this is a specimen\nof the way he makes a dishonest livelihood, by having a secret\nintelligence with thieves. It will be much better to test him by some\nnew artifice.” Then the king of his own accord brought a covered\npitcher into which he had thrown a frog, and said to Harisarman,\n\"Brahman, if you can guess what there is in this pitcher, I will do you\ngreat honour to-day.” When the Brahman Harisarman heard that, he\nthought that his last hour had come, and he called to mind the pet name\nof “Froggie” which his father had given him in his childhood in sport,\nand, impelled by luck, he called to himself by his pet name, lamenting\nhis hard fate, and suddenly called out: “This is a fine pitcher for\nyou, Froggie; it will soon become the swift destroyer of your helpless\nself.” The people there, when they heard him say that, raised a shout\nof applause, because his speech chimed in so well with the object\npresented to him, and murmured, “Ah! a great sage, he knows even about\nthe frog!” Then the king, thinking that this was all due to knowledge\nof divination, was highly delighted, and gave Harisarman the revenue of\nmore villages, with gold, an umbrella, and state carriages of all\nkinds. So Harisarman prospered in the world.",
        "A merchant started his son in life with three hundred rupees, and bade\nhim go to another country and try his luck in trade. The son took the\nmoney and departed. He had not gone far before he came across some\nherdsmen quarrelling over a dog, that some of them wished to kill.\n\"Please do not kill the dog,” pleaded the young and tender-hearted\nfellow; “I will give you one hundred rupees for it.” Then and there, of\ncourse, the bargain was concluded, and the foolish fellow took the dog,\nand continued his journey. He next met with some people fighting about\na cat. Some of them wanted to kill it, but others not. “Oh! please do\nnot kill it,” said he; “I will give you one hundred rupees for it.” Of\ncourse they at once gave him the cat and took the money. He went on\ntill he reached a village, where some folk were quarrelling over a\nsnake that had just been caught. Some of them wished to kill it, but\nothers did not. “Please do not kill the snake,” said he; “I will give\nyou one hundred rupees.” Of course the people agreed, and were highly\ndelighted.",
        "What a fool the fellow was! What would he do now that all his money was\ngone? What could he do except return to his father? Accordingly he went\nhome.",
        "“You fool! You scamp!” exclaimed his father when he had heard how his\nson had wasted all the money that had been given to him. “Go and live\nin the stables and repent of your folly. You shall never again enter my\nhouse.”",
        "So the young man went and lived in the stables. His bed was the grass\nspread for the cattle, and his companions were the dog, the cat, and\nthe snake, which he had purchased so dearly. These creatures got very\nfond of him, and would follow him about during the day, and sleep by\nhim at night; the cat used to sleep at his feet, the dog at his head,\nand the snake over his body, with its head hanging on one side and its\ntail on the other.",
        "One day the snake in course of conversation said to its master, “I am\nthe son of Raja Indrasha. One day, when I had come out of the ground to\ndrink the air, some people seized me, and would have slain me had you\nnot most opportunely arrived to my rescue. I do not know how I shall\never be able to repay you for your great kindness to me. Would that you\nknew my father! How glad he would be to see his son’s preserver!”",
        "“Where does he live? I should like to see him, if possible,” said the\nyoung man.",
        "“Well said!” continued the snake. “Do you see yonder mountain? At the\nbottom of that mountain there is a sacred spring. If you will come with\nme and dive into that spring, we shall both reach my father’s country.\nOh! how glad he will be to see you! He will wish to reward you, too.\nBut how can he do that? However, you may be pleased to accept something\nat his hand. If he asks you what you would like, you would, perhaps, do\nwell to reply, ’The ring on your right hand, and the famous pot and\nspoon which you possess.’ With these in your possession, you would\nnever need anything, for the ring is such that a man has only to speak\nto it, and immediately a beautiful furnished mansion will be provided\nfor him, while the pot and the spoon will supply him with all manner of\nthe rarest and most delicious foods.”",
        "Attended by his three companions the man walked to the well and\nprepared to jump in, according to the snake’s directions. “O master!\"\nexclaimed the cat and dog, when they saw what he was going to do. “What\nshall we do? Where shall we go?”",
        "“Wait for me here,” he replied. “I am not going far. I shall not be\nlong away.” On saying this, he dived into the water and was lost to\nsight.",
        "“Now what shall we do?” said the dog to the cat. “We must remain here,\"\nreplied the cat, “as our master ordered. Do not be anxious about food.\nI will go to the people’s houses and get plenty of food for both of\nus.” And so the cat did, and they both lived very comfortably till\ntheir master came again and joined them.",
        "The young man and the snake reached their destination in safety; and\ninformation of their arrival was sent to the Raja. His highness\ncommanded his son and the stranger to appear before him. But the snake\nrefused, saying that it could not go to its father till it was released\nfrom this stranger, who had saved it from a most terrible death, and\nwhose slave it therefore was. Then the Raja went and embraced his son,\nand saluting the stranger welcomed him to his dominions. The young man\nstayed there a few days, during which he received the Raja’s right-hand\nring, and the pot and spoon, in recognition of His Highness’s gratitude\nto him for having delivered his son. He then returned. On reaching the\ntop of the spring he found his friends, the dog and the cat, waiting\nfor him. They told one another all they had experienced since they had\nlast seen each other, and were all very glad. Afterwards they walked\ntogether to the river side, where it was decided to try the powers of\nthe charmed ring and pot and spoon.",
        "The merchant’s son spoke to the ring, and immediately a beautiful house\nand a lovely princess with golden hair appeared. He spoke to the pot\nand spoon, also, and the most delicious dishes of food were provided\nfor them. So he married the princess, and they lived very happily for\nseveral years, until one morning the princess, while arranging her\ntoilet, put the loose hairs into a hollow bit of reed and threw them\ninto the river that flowed along under the window. The reed floated on\nthe water for many miles, and was at last picked up by the prince of\nthat country, who curiously opened it and saw the golden hair. On\nfinding it the prince rushed off to the palace, locked himself up in\nhis room, and would not leave it. He had fallen desperately in love\nwith the woman whose hair he had picked up, and refused to eat, or\ndrink, or sleep, or move, till she was brought to him. The king, his\nfather, was in great distress about the matter, and did not know what\nto do. He feared lest his son should die and leave him without an heir.\nAt last he determined to seek the counsel of his aunt, who was an\nogress. The old woman consented to help him, and bade him not to be\nanxious, as she felt certain that she would succeed in getting the\nbeautiful woman for his son’s wife.",
        "She assumed the shape of a bee and went along buzzing, and buzzing, and\nbuzzing. Her keen sense of smell soon brought her to the beautiful\nprincess, to whom she appeared as an old hag, holding in one hand a\nstick by way of support. She introduced herself to the beautiful\nprincess and said, “I am your aunt, whom you have never seen before,\nbecause I left the country just after your birth.” She also embraced\nand kissed the princess by way of adding force to her words. The\nbeautiful princess was thoroughly deceived. She returned the ogress’s\nembrace, and invited her to come and stay in the house as long as she\ncould, and treated her with such honour and attention, that the ogress\nthought to herself, “I shall soon accomplish my errand.” When she had\nbeen in the house three days, she began to talk of the charmed ring,\nand advised her to keep it instead of her husband, because the latter\nwas constantly out shooting and on other such-like expeditions, and\nmight lose it. Accordingly the beautiful princess asked her husband for\nthe ring, and he readily gave it to her.",
        "The ogress waited another day before she asked to see the precious\nthing. Doubting nothing, the beautiful princess complied, when the\nogress seized the ring, and reassuming the form of a bee flew away with\nit to the palace, where the prince was lying nearly on the point of\ndeath. “Rise up. Be glad. Mourn no more,” she said to him. “The woman\nfor whom you yearn will appear at your summons. See, here is the charm,\nwhereby you may bring her before you.” The prince was almost mad with\njoy when he heard these words, and was so desirous of seeing the\nbeautiful princess, that he immediately spoke to the ring, and the\nhouse with its fair occupant descended in the midst of the palace\ngarden. He at once entered the building, and telling the beautiful\nprincess of his intense love, entreated her to be his wife. Seeing no\nescape from the difficulty, she consented on the condition that he\nwould wait one month for her.",
        "Meanwhile the merchant’s son had returned from hunting and was terribly\ndistressed not to find his house and wife. There was the place only,\njust as he knew it before he had tried the charmed ring which Raja\nIndrasha had given him. He sat down and determined to put an end to\nhimself. Presently the cat and dog came up. They had gone away and\nhidden themselves, when they saw the house and everything disappear. “O\nmaster!” they said, “stay your hand. Your trial is great, but it can be\nremedied. Give us one month, and we will go and try to recover your\nwife and house.”",
        "“Go,” said he, “and may the great God aid your efforts. Bring back my\nwife, and I shall live.”",
        "So the cat and dog started off at a run, and did not stop till they\nreached the place whither their mistress and the house had been taken.\n\"We may have some difficulty here,” said the cat. “Look, the king has\ntaken our master’s wife and house for himself. You stay here. I will go\nto the house and try to see her.” So the dog sat down, and the cat\nclimbed up to the window of the room, wherein the beautiful princess\nwas sitting, and entered. The princess recognised the cat, and informed\nit of all that had happened to her since she had left them.",
        "“But is there no way of escape from the hands of these people?” she\nasked.",
        "“Yes,” replied the cat, “if you can tell me where the charmed ring is.”",
        "“The ring is in the stomach of the ogress,” she said.",
        "“All right,” said the cat, “I will recover it. If we once get it,\neverything is ours.” Then the cat descended the wall of the house, and\nwent and laid down by a rat’s hole and pretended she was dead. Now at\nthat time a great wedding chanced to be going on among the rat\ncommunity of that place, and all the rats of the neighbourhood were\nassembled in that one particular mine by which the cat had lain down.\nThe eldest son of the king of the rats was about to be married. The cat\ngot to know of this, and at once conceived the idea of seizing the\nbridegroom and making him render the necessary help. Consequently, when\nthe procession poured forth from the hole squealing and jumping in\nhonour of the occasion, it immediately spotted the bridegroom and\npounced down on him. “Oh! let me go, let me go,” cried the terrified\nrat. “Oh! let him go,” squealed all the company. “It is his wedding\nday.”",
        "“No, no,” replied the cat. “Not unless you do some thing for me.\nListen. The ogress, who lives in that house with the prince and his\nwife, has swallowed a ring, which I very much want. If you will procure\nit for me, I will allow the rat to depart unharmed. If you do not, then\nyour prince dies under my feet.”",
        "“Very well, we agree,” said they all. “Nay, if we do not get the ring\nfor you, devour us all.”",
        "This was rather a bold offer. However, they accomplished the thing. At\nmidnight, when the ogress was sound asleep, one of the rats went to her\nbedside, climbed up on her face, and inserted its tail into her throat;\nwhereupon the ogress coughed violently, and the ring came out and\nrolled on to the floor. The rat immediately seized the precious thing\nand ran off with it to its king, who was very glad, and went at once to\nthe cat and released its son.",
        "As soon as the cat received the ring, she started back with the dog to\ngo and tell their master the good tidings. All seemed safe now. They\nhad only to give the ring to him, and he would speak to it, and the\nhouse and beautiful princess would again be with them, and everything\nwould go on as happily as before. “How glad master will be!” they\nthought, and ran as fast as their legs could carry them. Now, on the\nway they had to cross a stream. The dog swam, and the cat sat on its\nback. Now the dog was jealous of the cat, so he asked for the ring, and\nthreatened to throw the cat into the water if it did not give it up;\nwhereupon the cat gave up the ring. Sorry moment, for the dog at once\ndropped it, and a fish swallowed it.",
        "“Oh! what shall I do? what shall I do?” said the dog.",
        "“What is done is done,” replied the cat. “We must try to recover it,\nand if we do not succeed we had better drown ourselves in this stream.\nI have a plan. You go and kill a small lamb, and bring it here to me.”",
        "“All right,” said the dog, and at once ran off. He soon came back with\na dead lamb, and gave it to the cat. The cat got inside the lamb and\nlay down, telling the dog to go away a little distance and keep quiet.\nNot long after this a nadhar, a bird whose look can break the bones of\na fish, came and hovered over the lamb, and eventually pounced down on\nit to carry it away. On this the cat came out and jumped on to the\nbird, and threatened to kill it if it did not recover the lost ring.\nThis was most readily promised by the nadhar, who immediately flew off\nto the king of the fishes, and ordered it to make inquiries and to\nrestore the ring. The king of the fishes did so, and the ring was found\nand carried back to the cat.",
        "“Come along now; I have got the ring,” said the cat to the dog.",
        "“No, I will not,” said the dog, “unless you let me have the ring. I can\ncarry it as well as you. Let me have it or I will kill you.” So the cat\nwas obliged to give up the ring. The careless dog very soon dropped it\nagain. This time it was picked up and carried off by a kite.",
        "“See, see, there it goes–away to that big tree,” the cat exclaimed.",
        "“Oh! oh! what have I done?” cried the dog.",
        "“You foolish thing, I knew it would be so,” said the cat. “But stop\nyour barking, or you will frighten away the bird to some place where we\nshall not be able to trace it.”",
        "The cat waited till it was quite dark, and then climbed the tree,\nkilled the kite, and recovered the ring. “Come along,” it said to the\ndog when it reached the ground. “We must make haste now. We have been\ndelayed. Our master will die from grief and suspense. Come on.”",
        "The dog, now thoroughly ashamed of itself, begged the cat’s pardon for\nall the trouble it had given. It was afraid to ask for the ring the\nthird time, so they both reached their sorrowing master in safety and\ngave him the precious charm. In a moment his sorrow was turned into\njoy. He spoke to the ring, and his beautiful wife and house reappeared,\nand he and everybody were as happy as ever they could be.",
        "The future Buddha was once born in a minister’s family, when Brahma-\ndatta was reigning in Benares; and when he grew up, he became the\nking’s adviser in things temporal and spiritual.",
        "Now this king was very talkative; while he was speaking, others had no\nopportunity for a word. And the future Buddha, wanting to cure this\ntalkativeness of his, was constantly seeking for some means of doing\nso.",
        "At that time there was living, in a pond in the Himalaya mountains, a\ntortoise. Two young hamsas, or wild ducks, who came to feed there, made\nfriends with him. And one day, when they had become very intimate with\nhim, they said to the tortoise:",
        "“Friend tortoise! the place where we live, at the Golden Cave on Mount\nBeautiful in the Himalaya country, is a delightful spot. Will you come\nthere with us?”",
        "“But how can I get there?”",
        "“We can take you, if you can only hold your tongue, and will say\nnothing to anybody.”",
        "“Oh! that I can do. Take me with you.”",
        "“That’s right,” said they. And making the tortoise bite hold of a\nstick, they themselves took the two ends in their teeth, and flew up\ninto the air.",
        "Seeing him thus carried by the hamsas, some villagers called out, “Two\nwild ducks are carrying a tortoise along on a stick!” Whereupon the\ntortoise wanted to say, “If my friends choose to carry me, what is that\nto you, you wretched slaves!” So just as the swift flight of the wild\nducks had brought him over the king’s palace in the city of Benares, he\nlet go of the stick he was biting, and falling in the open courtyard,\nsplit in two! And there arose a universal cry, “A tortoise has fallen\nin the open courtyard, and has split in two!”",
        "The king, taking the future Buddha, went to the place, surrounded by\nhis courtiers; and looking at the tortoise, he asked the Bodisat,\n\"Teacher! how comes he to be fallen here?”",
        "The future Buddha thought to himself, “Long expecting, wishing to\nadmonish the king, have I sought for some means of doing so. This\ntortoise must have made friends with the wild ducks; and they must have\nmade him bite hold of the stick, and have flown up into the air to take\nhim to the hills. But he, being unable to hold his tongue when he hears\nany one else talk, must have wanted to say something, and let go the\nstick; and so must have fallen down from the sky, and thus lost his\nlife.” And saying, “Truly, O king! those who are called chatter-boxes–\npeople whose words have no end–come to grief like this,” he uttered\nthese Verses:",
        "  “Verily the tortoise killed himself\n  Whilst uttering his voice;\n  Though he was holding tight the stick,\n  By a word himself he slew.",
        "  “Behold him then, O excellent by strength!\n  And speak wise words, not out of season.\n  You see how, by his talking overmuch,\n  The tortoise fell into this wretched plight!”",
        "The king saw that he was himself referred to, and said, “O Teacher! are\nyou speaking of us?”",
        "And the Bodisat spake openly, and said, “O great king! be it thou, or\nbe it any other, whoever talks beyond measure meets with some mishap\nlike this.”",
        "And the king henceforth refrained himself, and became a man of few\nwords.",
        "A poor blind Brahman and his wife were dependent on their son for\ntheir subsistence. Every day the young fellow used to go out and get\nwhat he could by begging. This continued for some time, till at last he\nbecame quite tired of such a wretched life, and determined to go and\ntry his luck in another country. He informed his wife of his intention,\nand ordered her to manage somehow or other for the old people during\nthe few months that he would be absent. He begged her to be\nindustrious, lest his parents should be angry and curse him.",
        "One morning he started with some food in a bundle, and walked on day\nafter day, till he reached the chief city of the neighbouring country.\nHere he went and sat down by a merchant’s shop and asked alms. The\nmerchant inquired whence he had come, why he had come, and what was his\ncaste; to which he replied that he was a Brahman, and was wandering\nhither and thither begging a livelihood for himself and wife and\nparents. Moved with pity for the man, the merchant advised him to visit\nthe kind and generous king of that country, and offered to accompany\nhim to the court. Now at that time it happened that the king was\nseeking for a Brahman to look after a golden temple which he had just\nhad built. His Majesty was very glad, therefore, when he saw the\nBrahman and heard that he was good and honest. He at once deputed him\nto the charge of this temple, and ordered fifty kharwars of rice and\none hundred rupees to be paid to him every year as wages.",
        "Two months after this, the Brahman’s wife, not having heard any news of\nher husband, left the house and went in quest of him. By a happy fate\nshe arrived at the very place that he had reached, where she heard that\nevery morning at the golden temple a golden rupee was given in the\nking’s name to any beggar who chose to go for it. Accordingly, on the\nfollowing morning she went to the place and met her husband.",
        "“Why have you come here?” he asked. “Why have you left my parents? Care\nyou not whether they curse me and I die? Go back immediately, and await\nmy return.”",
        "“No, no,” said the woman. “I cannot go back to starve and see your old\nfather and mother die. There is not a grain of rice left in the house.”",
        "“O Bhagawant!” exclaimed the Brahman. “Here, take this,” he continued,\nscribbling a few lines on some paper, and then handing it to her, “and\ngive it to the king. You will see that he will give you a lac of rupees\nfor it.” Thus saying he dismissed her, and the woman left.",
        "On this scrap of paper were written three pieces of advice–First, If a\nperson is travelling and reaches any strange place at night, let him be\ncareful where he puts up, and not close his eyes in sleep, lest he\nclose them in death. Secondly, If a man has a married sister, and\nvisits her in great pomp, she will receive him for the sake of what she\ncan obtain from him; but if he comes to her in poverty, she will frown\non him and disown him. Thirdly, If a man has to do any work, he must do\nit himself, and do it with might and without fear.",
        "On reaching her home the Brahmani told her parents of her meeting with\nher husband, and what a valuable piece of paper he had given her; but\nnot liking to go before the king herself, she sent one of her\nrelations. The king read the paper, and ordering the man to be flogged,\ndismissed him. The next morning the Brahmani took the paper, and while\nshe was going along the road to the darbar reading it, the king’s son\nmet her, and asked what she was reading, whereupon she replied that she\nheld in her hands a paper containing certain bits of advice, for which\nshe wanted a lac of rupees. The prince asked her to show it to him, and\nwhen he had read it gave her a parwana for the amount, and rode on. The\npoor Brahmani was very thankful. That day she laid in a great store of\nprovisions, sufficient to last them all for a long time.",
        "In the evening the prince related to his father the meeting with the\nwoman, and the purchase of the piece of paper. He thought his father\nwould applaud the act. But it was not so. The king was more angry than\nbefore, and banished his son from the country.",
        "So the prince bade adieu to his mother and relations and friends, and\nrode off on his horse, whither he did not know. At nightfall he arrived\nat some place, where a man met him, and invited him to lodge at his\nhouse. The prince accepted the invitation, and was treated like a\nprince. Matting was spread for him to squat on, and the best provisions\nset before him.",
        "“Ah!” thought he, as he lay down to rest, “here is a case for the first\npiece of advice that the Brahmani gave me. I will not sleep to-night.”",
        "It was well that he thus resolved, for in the middle of the night the\nman rose up, and taking a sword in his hand, rushed to the prince with\nthe intention of killing him. But he rose up and spoke.",
        "“Do not slay me,” he said. “What profit would you get from my death? If\nyou killed me you would be sorry afterwards, like that man who killed\nhis dog.”",
        "“What man? What dog?” he asked.",
        "“I will tell you,” said the prince, “if you will give me that sword.”",
        "So he gave him the sword, and the prince began his story:",
        "“Once upon a time there lived a wealthy merchant who had a pet dog. He\nwas suddenly reduced to poverty, and had to part with his dog. He got a\nloan of five thousand rupees from a brother merchant, leaving the dog\nas a pledge, and with the money began business again. Not long after\nthis the other merchant’s shop was broken into by thieves and\ncompletely sacked. There was hardly ten rupees’ worth left in the\nplace. The faithful dog, however, knew what was going on, and went and\nfollowed the thieves, and saw where they deposited the things, and then\nreturned.",
        "“In the morning there was great weeping and lamentation in the\nmerchant’s house when it was known what had happened. The merchant\nhimself nearly went mad. Meanwhile the dog kept on running to the door,\nand pulling at his master’s shirt and paijamas, as though wishing him\nto go outside. At last a friend suggested that, perhaps, the dog knew\nsomething of the whereabouts of the things, and advised the merchant to\nfollow its leadings. The merchant consented, and went after the dog\nright up to the very place where the thieves had hidden the goods. Here\nthe animal scraped and barked, and showed in various ways that the\nthings were underneath. So the merchant and his friends dug about the\nplace, and soon came upon all the stolen property. Nothing was missing.\nThere was everything just as the thieves had taken them.",
        "“The merchant was very glad. On returning to his house, he at once sent\nthe dog back to its old master with a letter rolled under the collar,\nwherein he had written about the sagacity of the beast, and begged his\nfriend to forget the loan and to accept another five thousand rupees as\na present. When this merchant saw his dog coming back again, he\nthought, ’Alas! my friend is wanting the money. How can I pay him? I\nhave not had sufficient time to recover myself from my recent losses. I\nwill slay the dog ere he reaches the threshold, and say that another\nmust have slain it. Thus there will be an end of my debt.’",
        "“No dog, no loan. Accordingly he ran out and killed the poor dog, when\nthe letter fell out of its collar. The merchant picked it up and read\nit. How great was his grief and disappointment when he knew the facts\nof the case!",
        "“Beware,” continued the prince, “lest you do that which afterwards you\nwould give your life not to have done.”",
        "By the time the prince had concluded this story it was nearly morning,\nand he went away, after rewarding the man.",
        "The prince then visited the country belonging to his brother-in-law. He\ndisguised himself as a jogi, and sitting down by a tree near the\npalace, pretended to be absorbed in worship. News of the man and of his\nwonderful piety reached the ears of the king. He felt interested in\nhim, as his wife was very ill; and he had sought for hakims to cure\nher, but in vain. He thought that, perhaps, this holy man could do\nsomething for her. So he sent to him. But the jogi refused to tread the\nhalls of a king, saying that his dwelling was the open air, and that if\nhis Majesty wished to see him he must come himself and bring his wife\nto the place. Then the king took his wife and brought her to the jogi.\nThe holy man bade her prostrate herself before him, and when she had\nremained in this position for about three hours, he told her to rise\nand go, for she was cured.",
        "In the evening there was great consternation in the palace, because the\nqueen had lost her pearl rosary, and nobody knew anything about it. At\nlength some one went to the jogi, and found it on the ground by the\nplace where the queen had prostrated herself. When the king heard this\nhe was very angry, and ordered the jogi to be executed. This stern\norder, however, was not carried out, as the prince bribed the men and\nescaped from the country. But he knew that the second bit of advice was\ntrue.",
        "Clad in his own clothes, the prince was walking along one day when he\nsaw a potter crying and laughing alternately with his wife and\nchildren. “O fool,” said he, “what is the matter? If you laugh, why do\nyou weep? If you weep, why do you laugh?”",
        "“Do not bother me,” said the potter. “What does it matter to you?”",
        "“Pardon me,” said the prince, “but I should like to know the reason.”",
        "“The reason is this, then,” said the potter. “The king of this country\nhas a daughter whom he is obliged to marry every day, because all her\nhusbands die the first night of their stay with her. Nearly all the\nyoung men of the place have thus perished, and our son will be called\non soon. We laugh at the absurdity of the thing–a potter’s son\nmarrying a princess, and we cry at the terrible consequence of the\nmarriage. What can we do?”",
        "“Truly a matter for laughing and weeping. But weep no more,” said the\nprince. “I will exchange places with your son, and will be married to\nthe princess instead of him. Only give me suitable garments, and\nprepare me for the occasion.”",
        "So the potter gave him beautiful raiment and ornaments, and the prince\nwent to the palace. At night he was conducted to the apartment of the\nprincess. “Dread hour!” thought he; “am I to die like the scores of\nyoung men before me?” He clenched his sword with firm grip, and lay\ndown on his bed, intending to keep awake all the night and see what\nwould happen. In the middle of the night he saw two Shahmars come out\nfrom the nostrils of the princess. They stole over towards him,\nintending to kill him, like the others who had been before him: but he\nwas ready for them. He laid hold of his sword, and when the snakes\nreached his bed he struck at them and killed them. In the morning the\nking came as usual to inquire, and was surprised to hear his daughter\nand the prince talking gaily together. “Surely,” said he, “this man\nmust be her husband, as he only can live with her.”",
        "“Where do you come from? Who are you?” asked the king, entering the\nroom.",
        "“O king!” replied the prince, “I am the son of a king who rules over\nsuch-and-such a country.”",
        "When he heard this the king was very glad, and bade the prince to abide\nin his palace, and appointed him his successor to the throne. The\nprince remained at the palace for more than a year, and then asked\npermission to visit his own country, which was granted. The king gave\nhim elephants, horses, jewels, and abundance of money for the expenses\nof the way and as presents for his father, and the prince started.",
        "On the way he had to pass through the country belonging to his brother-\nin-law, whom we have already mentioned. Report of his arrival reached\nthe ears of the king, who came with rope-tied hands and haltered neck\nto do him homage. He most humbly begged him to stay at his palace, and\nto accept what little hospitality could be provided. While the prince\nwas staying at the palace he saw his sister, who greeted him with\nsmiles and kisses. On leaving he told her how she and her husband had\ntreated him at his first visit, and how he had escaped; and then gave\nthem two elephants, two beautiful horses, fifteen soldiers, and ten\nlacs rupees’ worth of jewels.",
        "Afterwards he went to his own home, and informed his mother and father\nof his arrival. Alas! his parents had both become blind from weeping\nabout the loss of their son. “Let him come in,” said the king, “and put\nhis hands upon our eyes, and we shall see again.” So the prince\nentered, and was most affectionately greeted by his old parents; and he\nlaid his hands on their eyes, and they saw again.",
        "Then the prince told his father all that had happened to him, and how\nhe had been saved several times by attending to the advice that he had\npurchased from the Brahmani. Whereupon the king expressed his sorrow\nfor having sent him away, and all was joy and peace again.",
        "Now in a certain place there lived a Brahman named Haridatta. He was a\nfarmer, but poor was the return his labour brought him. One day, at the\nend of the hot hours, the Brahman, overcome by the heat, lay down under\nthe shadow of a tree to have a doze. Suddenly he saw a great hooded\nsnake creeping out of an ant-hill near at hand. So he thought to\nhimself, “Sure this is the guardian deity of the field, and I have not\never worshipped it. That’s why my farming is in vain. I will at once go\nand pay my respects to it.”",
        "When he had made up his mind, he got some milk, poured it into a bowl,\nand went to the ant-hill, and said aloud: “O Guardian of this Field!\nall this while I did not know that you dwelt here. That is why I have\nnot yet paid my respects to you; pray forgive me.” And he laid the milk\ndown and went to his house. Next morning he came and looked, and he saw\na gold denar in the bowl, and from that time onward every day the same\nthing occurred he gave milk to the serpent and found a gold denar.",
        "One day the Brahman had to go to the village, and so he ordered his son\nto take the milk to the ant-hill. The son brought the milk, put it\ndown, and went back home. Next day he went again and found a denar, so\nhe thought to himself: “This ant-hill is surely full of golden denars;\nI’ll kill the serpent, and take them all for myself.” So next day,\nwhile he was giving the milk to the serpent, the Brahman’s son struck\nit on the head with a cudgel. But the serpent escaped death by the will\nof fate, and in a rage bit the Brahman’s son with its sharp fangs, and\nhe fell down dead at once. His people raised him a funeral pyre not far\nfrom the field and burnt him to ashes.",
        "Two days afterwards his father came back, and when he learnt his son’s\nfate he grieved and mourned. But after a time, he took the bowl of\nmilk, went to the ant-hill, and praised the serpent with a loud voice.\nAfter a long, long time the serpent appeared, but only with its head\nout of the opening of the ant-hill, and spoke to the Brahman: “’Tis\ngreed that brings you here, and makes you even forget the loss of your\nson. From this time forward friendship between us is impossible. Your\nson struck me in youthful ignorance, and I have bitten him to death.\nHow can I forget the blow with the cudgel? And how can you forget the\npain and grief at the loss of your son?” So speaking, it gave the\nBrahman a costly pearl and disappeared. But before it went away it\nsaid: “Come back no more.” The Brahman took the pearl, and went back\nhome, cursing the folly of his son.",
        "Once upon a time there lived a King who had seven Queens, but no\nchildren. This was a great grief to him, especially when he remembered\nthat on his death there would be no heir to inherit the kingdom.",
        "Now it happened one day that a poor old fakir came to the King, and\nsaid, “Your prayers are heard, your desire shall be accomplished, and\none of your seven Queens shall bear a son.”",
        "The King’s delight at this promise knew no bounds, and he gave orders\nfor appropriate festivities to be prepared against the coming event\nthroughout the length and breadth of the land.",
        "Meanwhile the seven Queens lived luxuriously in a splendid palace,\nattended by hundreds of female slaves, and fed to their hearts’ content\non sweetmeats and confectionery.",
        "Now the King was very fond of hunting, and one day, before he started,\nthe seven Queens sent him a message saying, “May it please our dearest\nlord not to hunt towards the north to-day, for we have dreamt bad\ndreams, and fear lest evil should befall you.”",
        "The king, to allay their anxiety, promised regard for their wishes, and\nset out towards the south; but as luck would have it, although he\nhunted diligently, he found no game. Nor had he more success to the\neast or west, so that, being a keen sportsman, and determined not to go\nhome empty-handed, he forgot all about his promise, and turned to the\nnorth. Here also he was at first unsuccessful, but just as he had made\nup his mind to give up for that day, a white hind with golden horns and\nsilver hoofs flashed past him into a thicket. So quickly did it pass\nthat he scarcely saw it; nevertheless a burning desire to capture and\npossess the beautiful strange creature filled his breast. He instantly\nordered his attendants to form a ring round the thicket, and so\nencircle the hind; then, gradually narrowing the circle, he pressed\nforward till he could distinctly see the white hind panting in the\nmidst. Nearer and nearer he advanced, till, just as he thought to lay\nhold of the beautiful strange creature, it gave one mighty bound, leapt\nclean over the King’s head, and fled towards the mountains. Forgetful\nof all else, the King, setting spurs to his horse, followed at full\nspeed. On, on he galloped, leaving his retinue far behind, keeping the\nwhite hind in view, never drawing bridle, until, finding himself in a\nnarrow ravine with no outlet, he reined in his steed. Before him stood\na miserable hovel, into which, being tired after his long, unsuccessful\nchase, he entered to ask for a drink of water. An old woman, seated in\nthe hut at a spinning-wheel, answered his request by calling to her\ndaughter, and immediately from an inner room came a maiden so lovely\nand charming, so white-skinned and golden-haired, that the King was\ntransfixed by astonishment at seeing so beautiful a sight in the\nwretched hovel.",
        "She held the vessel of water to the King’s lips, and as he drank he\nlooked into her eyes, and then it became clear to him that the girl was\nno other than the white hind with the golden horns and silver feet he\nhad chased so far.",
        "Her beauty bewitched him, so he fell on his knees, begging her to\nreturn with him as his bride; but she only laughed, saying seven Queens\nwere quite enough even for a King to manage. However, when he would\ntake no refusal, but implored her to have pity on him, promising her\neverything she could desire, she replied, “Give me the eyes of your\nseven Queens, and then perhaps I may believe you mean what you say.”",
        "The King was so carried away by the glamour of the white hind’s magical\nbeauty, that he went home at once, had the eyes of his seven Queens\ntaken out, and, after throwing the poor blind creatures into a noisome\ndungeon whence they could not escape, set off once more for the hovel\nin the ravine, bearing with him his horrible offering. But the white\nhind only laughed cruelly when she saw the fourteen eyes, and threading\nthem as a necklace, flung it round her mother’s neck, saying, “Wear\nthat, little mother, as a keepsake, whilst I am away in the King’s\npalace.”",
        "Then she went back with the bewitched monarch, as his bride, and he\ngave her the seven Queens’ rich clothes and jewels to wear, the seven\nQueens’ palace to live in, and the seven Queens’ slaves to wait upon\nher; so that she really had everything even a witch could desire.",
        "Now, very soon after the seven wretched hapless Queens had their eyes\ntorn out, and were cast into prison, a baby was born to the youngest of\nthe Queens. It was a handsome boy, but the other Queens were very\njealous that the youngest amongst them should be so fortunate. But\nthough at first they disliked the handsome little boy, he soon proved\nso useful to them, that ere long they all looked on him as their son.\nAlmost as soon as he could walk about he began scraping at the mud wall\nof their dungeon, and in an incredibly short space of time had made a\nhole big enough for him to crawl through. Through this he disappeared,\nreturning in an hour or so laden with sweet-meats, which he divided\nequally amongst the seven blind Queens.",
        "As he grew older he enlarged the hole, and slipped out two or three\ntimes every day to play with the little nobles in the town. No one knew\nwho the tiny boy was, but everybody liked him, and he was so full of\nfunny tricks and antics, so merry and bright, that he was sure to be\nrewarded by some girdle-cakes, a handful of parched grain, or some\nsweetmeats. All these things he brought home to his seven mothers, as\nhe loved to call the seven blind Queens, who by his help lived on in\ntheir dungeon when all the world thought they had starved to death ages\nbefore.",
        "At last, when he was quite a big lad, he one day took his bow and\narrow, and went out to seek for game. Coming by chance past the palace\nwhere the white hind lived in wicked splendour and magnificence, he saw\nsome pigeons fluttering round the white marble turrets, and, taking\ngood aim, shot one dead. It came tumbling past the very window where\nthe white Queen was sitting; she rose to see what was the matter, and\nlooked out. At the first glance of the handsome young lad standing\nthere bow in hand, she knew by witchcraft that it was the King’s son.",
        "She nearly died of envy and spite, determining to destroy the lad\nwithout delay; therefore, sending a servant to bring him to her\npresence, she asked him if he would sell her the pigeon he had just\nshot.",
        "“No,” replied the sturdy lad, “the pigeon is for my seven blind\nmothers, who live in the noisome dungeon, and who would die if I did\nnot bring them food.”",
        "“Poor souls!” cried the cunning white witch; “would you not like to\nbring them their eyes again? Give me the pigeon, my dear, and I\nfaithfully promise to show you where to find them.”",
        "Hearing this, the lad was delighted beyond measure, and gave up the\npigeon at once. Whereupon the white Queen told him to seek her mother\nwithout delay, and ask for the eyes which she wore as a necklace.",
        "“She will not fail to give them,” said the cruel Queen, “if you show\nher this token on which I have written what I want done.”",
        "So saying, she gave the lad a piece of broken potsherd, with these\nwords inscribed on it–\"Kill the bearer at once, and sprinkle his blood\nlike water!”",
        "Now, as the son of seven Queens could not read, he took the fatal\nmessage cheerfully, and set off to find the white Queen’s mother.",
        "Whilst he was journeying be passed through a town, where every one of\nthe inhabitants looked so sad, that he could not help asking what was\nthe matter. They told him it was because the King’s only daughter\nrefused to marry; so when her father died there would be no heir to the\nthrone. They greatly feared she must be out of her mind, for though\nevery good-looking young man in the kingdom had been shown to her, she\ndeclared she would only marry one who was the son of seven mothers, and\nwho ever heard of such a thing? The King, in despair, had ordered every\nman who entered the city gates to be led before the Princess; so, much\nto the lad’s impatience, for he was in an immense hurry to find his\nmothers’ eyes, he was dragged into the presence-chamber.",
        "No sooner did the Princess catch sight of him than she blushed, and,\nturning to the King, said, “Dear father, this is my choice!”",
        "Never were such rejoicings as these few words produced.",
        "The inhabitants nearly went wild with joy, but the son of seven Queens\nsaid he would not marry the Princess unless they first let him recover\nhis mothers’ eyes. When the beautiful bride heard his story, she asked\nto see the potsherd, for she was very learned and clever. Seeing the\ntreacherous words, she said nothing, but taking another similar-shaped\nbit of potsherd, she wrote on it these words–\"Take care of this lad,\ngiving him all he desires,” and returned it to the son of seven Queens,\nwho, none the wiser, set off on his quest.",
        "Ere long he arrived at the hovel in the ravine where the white witch’s\nmother, a hideous old creature, grumbled dreadfully on reading the\nmessage, especially when the lad asked for the necklace of eyes.\nNevertheless she took it off, and gave it him, saying, “There are only\nthirteen of ’em now, for I lost one last week.”",
        "The lad, however, was only too glad to get any at all, so he hurried\nhome as fast as he could to his seven mothers, and gave two eyes apiece\nto the six elder Queens; but to the youngest he gave one, saying,\n\"Dearest little mother!–I will be your other eye always!”",
        "After this he set off to marry the Princess, as he had promised, but\nwhen passing by the white Queen’s palace he saw some pigeons on the\nroof. Drawing his bow, he shot one, and it came fluttering past the\nwindow. The white hind looked out, and lo! there was the King’s son\nalive and well.",
        "She cried with hatred and disgust, but sending for the lad, asked him\nhow he had returned so soon, and when she heard how he had brought home\nthe thirteen eyes, and given them to the seven blind Queens, she could\nhardly restrain her rage. Nevertheless she pretended to be charmed with\nhis success, and told him that if he would give her this pigeon also,\nshe would reward him with the Jogi’s wonderful cow, whose milk flows\nall day long, and makes a pond as big as a kingdom. The lad, nothing\nloth, gave her the pigeon; whereupon, as before, she bade him go ask\nher mother for the cow, and gave him a potsherd whereon was written–\n\"Kill this lad without fail, and sprinkle his blood like water!”",
        "But on the way the son of seven Queens looked in on the Princess, just\nto tell her how he came to be delayed, and she, after reading the\nmessage on the potsherd, gave him another in its stead; so that when\nthe lad reached the old hag’s hut and asked her for the Jogi’s cow, she\ncould not refuse, but told the boy how to find it; and bidding him of\nall things not to be afraid of the eighteen thousand demons who kept\nwatch and ward over the treasure, told him to be off before she became\ntoo angry at her daughter’s foolishness in thus giving away so many\ngood things.",
        "Then the lad did as he had been told bravely. He journeyed on and on\ntill he came to a milk-white pond, guarded by the eighteen thousand\ndemons. They were really frightful to behold, but, plucking up courage,\nhe whistled a tune as he walked through them, looking neither to the\nright nor the left. By-and-by he came upon the Jogi’s cow, tall, white,\nand beautiful, while the Jogi himself, who was king of all the demons,\nsat milking her day and night, and the milk streamed from her udder,\nfilling the milk-white tank.",
        "The Jogi, seeing the lad, called out fiercely, “What do you want here?”",
        "Then the lad answered, according to the old hag’s bidding, “I want your\nskin, for King Indra is making a new kettle-drum, and says your skin is\nnice and tough.”",
        "Upon this the Jogi began to shiver and shake (for no Jinn or Jogi dares\ndisobey King Indra’s command), and, falling at the lad’s feet, cried,\n\"If you will spare me I will give you anything I possess, even my\nbeautiful white cow!”",
        "To this the son of seven Queens, after a little pretended hesitation,\nagreed, saying that after all it would not be difficult to find a nice\ntough skin like the Jogi’s elsewhere; so, driving the wonderful cow\nbefore him, he set off homewards. The seven Queens were delighted to\npossess so marvellous an animal, and though they toiled from morning\ntill night making curds and whey, besides selling milk to the\nconfectioners, they could not use half the cow gave, and became richer\nand richer day by day.",
        "Seeing them so comfortably off, the son of seven Queens started with a\nlight heart to marry the Princess; but when passing the white hind’s\npalace he could not resist sending a bolt at some pigeons which were\ncooing on the parapet. One fell dead just beneath the window where the\nwhite Queen was sitting. Looking out, she saw the lad hale and hearty\nstanding before her, and grew whiter than ever with rage and spite.",
        "She sent for him to ask how he had returned so soon, and when she heard\nhow kindly her mother had received him, she very nearly had a fit;\nhowever, she dissembled her feelings as well as she could, and, smiling\nsweetly, said she was glad to have been able to fulfil her promise, and\nthat if he would give her this third pigeon, she would do yet more for\nhim than she had done before, by giving him the million-fold rice,\nwhich ripens in one night.",
        "The lad was of course delighted at the very idea, and, giving up the\npigeon, set off on his quest, armed as before with a potsherd, on which\nwas written, “Do not fail this time. Kill the lad, and sprinkle his\nblood like water!”",
        "But when he looked in on his Princess, just to prevent her becoming\nanxious about him, she asked to see the potsherd as usual, and\nsubstituted another, on which was written, “Yet again give this lad all\nhe requires, for his blood shall be as your blood!”",
        "Now when the old hag saw this, and heard how the lad wanted the\nmillion-fold rice which ripens in a single night, she fell into the\nmost furious rage, but being terribly afraid of her daughter, she\ncontrolled herself, and bade the boy go and find the field guarded by\neighteen millions of demons, warning him on no account to look back\nafter having plucked the tallest spike of rice, which grew in the\ncentre.",
        "So the son of seven Queens set off, and soon came to the field where,\nguarded by eighteen millions of demons, the million-fold rice grew. He\nwalked on bravely, looking neither to the right or left, till he\nreached the centre and plucked the tallest ear, but as he turned\nhomewards a thousand sweet voices rose behind him, crying in tenderest\naccents, “Pluck me too! oh, please pluck me too!” He looked back, and\nlo! there was nothing left of him but a little heap of ashes!",
        "Now as time passed by and the lad did not return, the old hag grew\nuneasy, remembering the message “his blood shall be as your blood\"; so\nshe set off to see what had happened.",
        "Soon she came to the heap of ashes, and knowing by her arts what it\nwas, she took a little water, and kneading the ashes into a paste,\nformed it into the likeness of a man; then, putting a drop of blood\nfrom her little finger into its mouth, she blew on it, and instantly\nthe son of seven Queens started up as well as ever.",
        "“Don’t you disobey orders again!” grumbled the old hag, “or next time\nI’ll leave you alone. Now be off, before I repent of my kindness!”",
        "So the son of seven Queens returned joyfully to his seven mothers, who,\nby the aid of the million-fold rice, soon became the richest people in\nthe kingdom. Then they celebrated their son’s marriage to the clever\nPrincess with all imaginable pomp; but the bride was so clever, she\nwould not rest until she had made known her husband to his father, and\npunished the wicked white witch. So she made her husband build a palace\nexactly like the one in which the seven Queens had lived, and in which\nthe white witch now dwelt in splendour. Then, when all was prepared,\nshe bade her husband give a grand feast to the King. Now the King had\nheard much of the mysterious son of seven Queens, and his marvellous\nwealth, so he gladly accepted the invitation; but what was his\nastonishment when on entering the palace he found it was a facsimile of\nhis own in every particular! And when his host, richly attired, led him\nstraight to the private hall, where on royal thrones sat the seven\nQueens, dressed as he had last seen them, he was speechless with\nsurprise, until the Princess, coming forward, threw herself at his\nfeet, and told him the whole story. Then the King awoke from his\nenchantment, and his anger rose against the wicked white hind who had\nbewitched him so long, until he could not contain himself. So she was\nput to death, and her grave ploughed over, and after that the seven\nQueens returned to their own splendid palace, and everybody lived\nhappily.",
        "Once upon a time, when Brahma-datta was reigning in Benares, the future\nBuddha returned to life as his son and heir. And when the day came for\nchoosing a name, they called him Prince Brahma-datta. He grew up in due\ncourse; and when he was sixteen years old, went to Takkasila, and\nbecame accomplished in all arts. And after his father died he ascended\nthe throne, and ruled the kingdom with righteousness and equity. He\ngave judgments without partiality, hatred, ignorance, or fear. Since he\nthus reigned with justice, with justice also his ministers administered\nthe law. Lawsuits being thus decided with justice, there were none who\nbrought false cases. And as these ceased, the noise and tumult of\nlitigation ceased in the king’s court. Though the judges sat all day in\nthe court, they had to leave without any one coming for justice. It\ncame to this, that the Hall of Justice would have to be closed!",
        "Then the future Buddha thought, “It cannot be from my reigning with\nrighteousness that none come for judgment; the bustle has ceased, and\nthe Hall of Justice will have to be closed. I must, therefore, now\nexamine into my own faults; and if I find that anything is wrong in me,\nput that away, and practise only virtue.”",
        "Thenceforth he sought for some one to tell him his faults, but among\nthose around him he found no one who would tell him of any fault, but\nheard only his own praise.",
        "Then he thought, “It is from fear of me that these men speak only good\nthings, and not evil things,” and he sought among those people who\nlived outside the palace. And finding no fault-finder there, he sought\namong those who lived outside the city, in the suburbs, at the four\ngates. And there too finding no one to find fault, and hearing only his\nown praise, he determined to search the country places.",
        "So he made over the kingdom to his ministers, and mounted his chariot;\nand taking only his charioteer, left the city in disguise. And\nsearching the country through, up to the very boundary, he found no\nfault-finder, and heard only of his own virtue; and so he turned back\nfrom the outer-most boundary, and returned by the high road towards the\ncity.",
        "Now at that time the king of Kosala, Mallika by name, was also ruling\nhis kingdom with righteousness; and when seeking for some fault in\nhimself, he also found no fault-finder in the palace, but only heard of\nhis own virtue! So seeking in country places, he too came to that very\nspot. And these two came face to face in a low cart-track with\nprecipitous sides, where there was no space for a chariot to get out of\nthe way!",
        "Then the charioteer of Mallika the king said to the charioteer of the\nking of Benares, “Take thy chariot out of the way!”",
        "But he said, “Take thy chariot out of the way, O charioteer! In this\nchariot sitteth the lord over the kingdom of Benares, the great king\nBrahma-datta.”",
        "Yet the other replied, “In this chariot, O charioteer, sitteth the lord\nover the kingdom of Kosala, the great king Mallika. Take thy carriage\nout of the way, and make room for the chariot of our king!”",
        "Then the charioteer of the king of Benares thought, “They say then that\nhe too is a king! What is now to be done?” After some consideration,\nhe said to himself, “I know a way. I’ll find out how old he is, and then\nI’ll let the chariot of the younger be got out of the way, and so make\nroom for the elder.”",
        "And when he had arrived at that conclusion, he asked that charioteer\nwhat the age of the king of Kosala was. But on inquiry he found that\nthe ages of both were equal. Then he inquired about the extent of his\nkingdom, and about his army, and his wealth, and his renown, and about\nthe country he lived in, and his caste and tribe and family. And he\nfound that both were lords of a kingdom three hundred leagues in\nextent; and that in respect of army and wealth and renown, and the\ncountries in which they lived, and their caste and their tribe and\ntheir family, they were just on a par!",
        "Then he thought, “I will make way for the most righteous.” And he\nasked, “What kind of righteousness has this king of yours?”",
        "Then the chorister of the king of Kosala, proclaiming his king’s\nwickedness as goodness, uttered the First Stanza:",
        "  “The strong he overthrows by strength,\n  The mild by mildness, does Mallika;\n  The good he conquers by goodness,\n  And the wicked by wickedness too.\n    Such is the nature of this king!\n    Move out of the way, O charioteer!”",
        "But the charioteer of the king of Benares asked him, “Well, have you\ntold all the virtues of your king?”",
        "“Yes,” said the other.",
        "“If these are his virtues, where are then his faults?” replied\nhe.",
        "The other said, “Well, for the nonce, they shall be faults, if you\nlike! But pray, then, what is the kind of goodness your king has?”",
        "And then the charioteer of the king of Benares called unto him to\nhearken, and uttered the Second Stanza",
        "  “Anger he conquers by calmness,\n  And by goodness the wicked;\n  The stingy he conquers by gifts,\n  And by truth the speaker of lies.\n    Such is the nature of this king!\n    Move out of the way, O charioteer!”",
        "And when he had thus spoken, both Mallika the king and his charioteer\nalighted from their chariot. And they took out the horses, and removed\ntheir chariot, and made way for the king of Benares!",
        "In a certain village there lived ten cloth merchants, who always went\nabout together. Once upon a time they had travelled far afield, and\nwere returning home with a great deal of money which they had obtained\nby selling their wares. Now there happened to be a dense forest near\ntheir village, and this they reached early one morning. In it there\nlived three notorious robbers, of whose existence the traders had never\nheard, and while they were still in the middle of it the robbers stood\nbefore them, with swords and cudgels in their hands, and ordered them\nto lay down all they had. The traders had no weapons with them, and so,\nthough they were many more in number, they had to submit themselves to\nthe robbers, who took away everything from them, even the very clothes\nthey wore, and gave to each only a small loin-cloth a span in breadth\nand a cubit in length.",
        "The idea that they had conquered ten men and plundered all their\nproperty, now took possession of the robbers’ minds. They seated\nthemselves like three monarchs before the men they had plundered, and\nordered them to dance to them before returning home. The merchants now\nmourned their fate. They had lost all they had, except their loin-\ncloth, and still the robbers were not satisfied, but ordered them to\ndance.",
        "There was, among the ten merchants, one who was very clever. He\npondered over the calamity that had come upon him and his friends, the\ndance they would have to perform, and the magnificent manner in which\nthe three robbers had seated themselves on the grass. At the same time\nhe observed that these last had placed their weapons on the ground, in\nthe assurance of having thoroughly cowed the traders, who were now\ncommencing to dance. So he took the lead in the dance, and, as a song\nis always sung by the leader on such occasions, to which the rest keep\ntime with hands and feet, he thus began to sing:",
        "  “We are enty men,\n  They are erith men:\n  If each erith man,   Surround eno men\n  Eno man remains.\n  Tâ, tai, tôm, tadingana.“",
        "The robbers were all uneducated, and thought that the leader was merely\nsinging a song as usual. So it was in one sense; for the leader\ncommenced from a distance, and had sung the song over twice before he\nand his companions commenced to approach the robbers. They had\nunderstood his meaning, because they had been trained in trade.",
        "When two traders discuss the price of an article in the presence of a\npurchaser, they use a riddling sort of language.",
        "“What is the price of this cloth?” one trader will ask another.",
        "“Enty rupees,” another will reply, meaning “ten rupees.”",
        "Thus, there is no possibility of the purchaser knowing what is meant\nunless he be acquainted with trade language. By the rules of this\nsecret language erith means “three,” enty means “ten,” and eno means\n\"one.” So the leader by his song meant to hint to his fellow-traders\nthat they were ten men, the robbers only three, that if three pounced\nupon each of the robbers, nine of them could hold them down, while the\nremaining one bound the robbers’ hands and feet.",
        "The three thieves, glorying in their victory, and little understanding\nthe meaning of the song and the intentions of the dancers, were proudly\nseated chewing betel and tobacco. Meanwhile the song was sung a third\ntime. Tâ tai tôm had left the lips of the singer; and, before\ntadingana was out of them, the traders separated into parties of\nthree, and each party pounced upon a thief. The remaining one–the\nleader himself–tore up into long narrow strips a large piece of cloth,\nsix cubits long, and tied the hands and feet of the robbers. These were\nentirely humbled now, and rolled on the ground like three bags of rice!",
        "The ten traders now took back all their property, and armed themselves\nwith the swords and cudgels of their enemies; and when they reached\ntheir village, they often amused their friends and relatives by\nrelating their adventure.",
        "Once there lived a great Raja, whose name was Salabhan, and he had a\nQueen, by name Lona, who, though she wept and prayed at many a shrine,\nhad never a child to gladden her eyes. After a long time, however, a\nson was promised to her.",
        "Queen Lona returned to the palace, and when the time for the birth of\nthe promised son drew nigh, she inquired of three Jogis who came\nbegging to her gate, what the child’s fate would be, and the youngest\nof them answered and said, “Oh, Queen! the child will be a boy, and he\nwill live to be a great man. But for twelve years you must not look\nupon his face, for if either you or his father see it before the twelve\nyears are past, you will surely die! This is what you must do; as soon\nas the child is born you must send him away to a cellar underneath the\nground, and never let him see the light of day for twelve years. After\nthey are over, he may come forth, bathe in the river, put on new\nclothes, and visit you. His name shall be Raja Rasalu, and he shall be\nknown far and wide.”",
        "So, when a fair young Prince was in due time born into the world, his\nparents hid him away in an underground palace, with nurses, and\nservants, and everything else a King’s son might desire. And with him\nthey sent a young colt, born the same day, and sword, spear, and\nshield, against the day when Raja Rasalu should go forth into the\nworld.",
        "So there the child lived, playing with his colt, and talking to his\nparrot, while the nurses taught him all things needful for a King’s son\nto know.",
        "Young Rasalu lived on, far from the light of day, for eleven long\nyears, growing tall and strong, yet contented to remain playing with\nhis colt, and talking to his parrot; but when the twelfth year began,\nthe lad’s heart leapt up with desire for change, and he loved to listen\nto the sounds of life which came to him in his palace-prison from the\noutside world.",
        "“I must go and see where the voices come from!” he said; and when his\nnurses told him he must not go for one year more, he only laughed\naloud, saying, “Nay! I stay no longer here for any man!”",
        "Then he saddled his Arab horse Bhaunr, put on his shining armour, and\nrode forth into the world; but mindful of what his nurses had oft told\nhim, when he came to the river, he dismounted, and, going into the\nwater, washed himself and his clothes.",
        "Then, clean of raiment, fair of face, and brave of heart, he rode on\nhis way until he reached his father’s city. There he sat down to rest\nawhile by a well, where the women were drawing water in earthen\npitchers. Now, as they passed him, their full pitchers poised upon\ntheir heads, the gay young Prince flung stones at the earthen vessels,\nand broke them all. Then the women, drenched with water, went weeping\nand wailing to the palace, complaining to the King that a mighty young\nPrince in shining armour, with a parrot on his wrist and a gallant\nsteed beside him, sat by the well, and broke their pitchers.",
        "Now, as soon as Rajah Salabhan heard this, he guessed at once that it\nwas Prince Rasalu come forth before the time, and, mindful of the\nJogis’ words that he would die if he looked on his son’s face before\ntwelve years were past, he did not dare to send his guards to seize the\noffender and bring him to be judged. So he bade the women be comforted,\nand take pitchers of iron and brass, giving new ones from his treasury\nto those who did not possess any of their own.",
        "But when Prince Rasalu saw the women returning to the well with\npitchers of iron and brass, he laughed to himself, and drew his mighty\nbow till the sharp-pointed arrows pierced the metal vessels as though\nthey had been clay.",
        "Yet still the King did not send for him, so he mounted his steed and\nset off in the pride of his youth and strength to the palace. He strode\ninto the audience hall, where his father sat trembling, and saluted him\nwill all reverence; but Raja Salabhan, in fear of his life, turned his\nback hastily and said never a word in reply.",
        "Then Prince Rasalu called scornfully to him across the hall:",
        "  “I came to greet thee, King, and not to harm thee!\n     What have I done that thou shouldst turn away?\n   Sceptre and empire have no power to charm me–\n     I go to seek a worthier prize than they!”",
        "Then he strode away, full of bitterness and anger; but, as he passed\nunder the palace windows, he heard his mother weeping, and the sound\nsoftened his heart, so that his wrath died down, and a great loneliness\nfell upon him, because he was spurned by both father and mother. So he\ncried sorrowfully,",
        "  “Oh heart crown’d with grief, hast thou nought\n    But tears for thy son?\n  Art mother of mine? Give one thought\n    To my life just begun!”",
        "And Queen Lona answered through her tears:",
        "  “Yea! mother am I, though I weep,\n    So hold this word sure,–\n  Go, reign king of all men, but keep\n    Thy heart good and pure!”",
        "So Raja Rasalu was comforted, and began to make ready for fortune. He\ntook with him his horse Bhaunr and his parrot, both of whom had lived\nwith him since he was born.",
        "So they made a goodly company, and Queen Lona, when she saw them going,\nwatched them from her window till she saw nothing but a cloud of dust\non the horizon; then she bowed her head on her hands and wept, saying:",
        "  “Oh! son who ne’er gladdened mine eyes,\n  Let the cloud of thy going arise,\n  Dim the sunlight and darken the day;\n  For the mother whose son is away\n      Is as dust!”",
        "Rasalu had started off to play chaupur with King Sarkap. And as he\njourneyed there came a fierce storm of thunder and lightning, so that\nhe sought shelter, and found none save an old graveyard, where a\nheadless corpse lay upon the ground. So lonesome was it that even the\ncorpse seemed company, and Rasalu, sitting down beside it, said:",
        "  “There is no one here, nor far nor near,\n    Save this breathless corpse so cold and grim;\n  Would God he might come to life again,\n    ’Twould be less lonely to talk to him.”",
        "And immediately the headless corpse arose and sat beside Raja Rasalu.\nAnd he, nothing astonished, said to it:",
        "  “The storm beats fierce and loud,\n    The clouds rise thick in the west;\n  What ails thy grave and shroud,\n    Oh corpse! that thou canst not rest?”",
        "Then the headless corpse replied:",
        "  “On earth I was even as thou,\n    My turban awry like a king,\n  My head with the highest, I trow,\n    Having my fun and my fling,\n  Fighting my foes like a brave,\n    Living my life with a swing.\n        And, now I am dead,\n        Sins, heavy as lead,\n  Will give me no rest in my grave!”",
        "So the night passed on, dark and dreary, while Rasalu sat in the\ngraveyard and talked to the headless corpse. Now when morning broke and\nRasalu said he must continue his journey, the headless corpse asked him\nwhither he was going, and when he said “to play chaupur with King\nSarkap,” the corpse begged him to give up the idea saying, “I am King\nSarkap’s brother, and I know his ways. Every day, before breakfast, he\ncuts off the heads of two or three men, just to amuse himself. One day\nno one else was at hand, so he cut off mine, and he will surely cut off\nyours on some pretence or another. However, if you are determined to go\nand play chaupur with him, take some of the bones from this graveyard,\nand make your dice out of them, and then the enchanted dice with which\nmy brother plays will lose their virtue. Otherwise he will always win.”",
        "So Rasalu took some of the bones lying about, and fashioned them into\ndice, and these he put into his pocket. Then, bidding adieu to the\nheadless corpse, he went on his way to play chaupur with the King.",
        "Now, as Raja Rasalu, tender-hearted and strong, journeyed along to play\nchaupur with the King, he came to a burning forest, and a voice rose\nfrom the fire saying, “Oh, traveller! for God’s sake save me from the\nfire!”",
        "Then the Prince turned towards the burning forest, and, lo! the voice\nwas the voice of a tiny cricket. Nevertheless, Rasalu, tender-hearted\nand strong, snatched it from the fire and set it at liberty. Then the\nlittle creature, full of gratitude, pulled out one of its feelers, and\ngiving it to its preserver, said, “Keep this, and should you ever be in\ntrouble, put it into the fire, and instantly I will come to your aid.”",
        "The Prince smiled, saying, “What help could you give me?\"\nNevertheless, he kept the hair and went on his way.",
        "Now, when he reached the city of King Sarkap, seventy maidens,\ndaughters of the King, came out to meet him,–seventy fair maidens,\nmerry and careless, full of smiles and laughter; but one, the youngest\nof them all, when she saw the gallant young Prince riding on Bhaunr\nIraqi, going gaily to his doom, was filled with pity, and called to him\nsaying:",
        "  “Fair Prince, on the charger so gray,\n      Turn thee back! turn thee back!\n  Or lower thy lance for the fray;\n  Thy head will be forfeit to-day!\n  Dost love life? then, stranger, I pray,\n      Turn thee back! turn thee back!”",
        "But he, smiling at the maiden, answered lightly:",
        "  “Fair maiden, I come from afar,\n  Sworn conqueror in love and in war!\n  King Sarkap my coming will rue,\n  His head in four pieces I’ll hew;\n  Then forth as a bridegroom I’ll ride,\n  With you, little maid, as my bride!”",
        "Now when Rasalu replied so gallantly, the maiden looked in his face,\nand seeing how fair he was, and how brave and strong, she straightway\nfell in love with him, and would gladly have followed him through the\nworld.",
        "But the other sixty-nine maidens, being jealous, laughed scornfully at\nher, saying, “Not so fast, oh gallant warrior! If you would marry our\nsister you must first do our bidding, for you will be our younger\nbrother.”",
        "“Fair sisters!” quoth Rasalu gaily, “give me my task and I will perform\nit.”",
        "So the sixty-nine maidens mixed a hundred-weight of millet seed with a\nhundredweight of sand, and giving it to Rasalu, bade him separate the\nseed from the sand.",
        "Then he bethought him of the cricket, and drawing the feeler from his\npocket, thrust it into the fire. And immediately there was a whirring\nnoise in the air, and a great flight of crickets alighted beside him,\nand amongst them the cricket whose life he had saved.",
        "Then Rasalu said, “Separate the millet seed from the sand.”",
        "“Is that all?” quoth the cricket; “had I known how small a job you\nwanted me to do, I would not have assembled so many of my brethren.”",
        "With that the flight of crickets set to work, and in one night they\nseparated the seed from the sand.",
        "Now when the sixty-nine fair maidens, daughters of the king saw that\nRasalu had performed his task, they set him another, bidding him swing\nthem all, one by one, in their swings, until they were tired.",
        "Whereupon he laughed, saying, “There are seventy of you, counting my\nlittle bride yonder, and I am not going to spend my life swinging\ngirls! Why, by the time I have given each of you a swing, the first\nwill be wanting another! No! if you want a swing, get in, all seventy\nof you, into one swing, and then I’ll see what can be done.”",
        "So the seventy maidens climbed into one swing, and Raja Rasalu,\nstanding in his shining armour, fastened the ropes to his mighty bow,\nand drew it up to its fullest bent. Then he let go, and like an arrow\nthe swing shot into the air, with its burden of seventy fair maidens,\nmerry and careless, full of smiles and laughter.",
        "But as it swung back again, Kasalu, standing there in his shining\narmour, drew his sharp sword and severed the ropes. Then the seventy\nfair maidens fell to the ground headlong; and some were bruised and\nsome broken, but the only one who escaped unhurt was the maiden who\nloved Rasalu, for she fell out last, on the top of the others, and so\ncame to no harm.",
        "After this, Rasalu strode on fifteen paces, till he came to the seventy\ndrums, that every one who came to play chaupur with the King had to\nbeat in turn; and he beat them so loudly that he broke them all. Then\nhe came to the seventy gongs, all in a row, and he hammered them so\nhard that they cracked to pieces.",
        "Seeing this, the youngest Princess, who was the only one who could run,\nfled to her father the King in a great fright, saying:",
        "  “A mighty Prince, Sarkap! making havoc, rides along,\n  He swung us, seventy maidens fair, and threw us out\n  headlong;\n  He broke the drums you placed there and the gongs too\n  in his pride,\n  Sure, he will kill thee, father mine, and take me for his\n  bride!”",
        "But King Sarkap replied scornfully:",
        "  “Silly maiden, thy words make a lot\n  Of a very small matter;\n  For fear of my valour, I wot,\n  His armour will clatter.\n  As soon as I’ve eaten my bread\n  I’ll go forth and cut off his head!”",
        "Notwithstanding these brave and boastful words, he was in reality very\nmuch afraid, having heard of Rasalu’s renown. And learning that he was\nstopping at the house of an old woman in the city, till the hour for\nplaying chaupur arrived, Sarkap sent slaves to him with trays of\nsweetmeats and fruit, as to an honoured guest. But the food was\npoisoned.",
        "Now when the slaves brought the trays to Raja Rasalu, he rose up\nhaughtily, saying, “Go, tell your master I have nought to do with him\nin friendship. I am his sworn enemy, and I eat not of his salt!”",
        "So saying, he threw the sweetmeats to Raja Sarkap’s dog, which had\nfollowed the slave, and lo! the dog died.",
        "Then Rasalu was very wroth, and said bitterly, “Go back to Sarkap,\nslaves! and tell him that Rasalu deems it no act of bravery to kill\neven an enemy by treachery.”",
        "Now, when evening came, Raja Rasalu went forth to play chaupur with\nKing Sarkap, and as he passed some potters’ kilns he saw a cat\nwandering about restlessly; so he asked what ailed her, that she never\nstood still, and she replied, “My kittens are in an unbaked pot in the\nkiln yonder. It has just been set alight, and my children will be baked\nalive; therefore I cannot rest!”",
        "Her words moved the heart of Raja Rasalu, and, going to the potter, he\nasked him to sell the kiln as it was; but the potter replied that he\ncould not settle a fair price till the pots were burnt, as he could not\ntell how many would come out whole. Nevertheless, after some\nbargaining, he consented at last to sell the kiln, and Rasalu, having\nsearched all the pots, restored the kittens to their mother, and she,\nin gratitude for his mercy, gave him one of them, saying, “Put it in\nyour pocket, for it will help you when you are in difficulties.” So\nRaja Rasalu put the kitten in his pocket, and went to play chaupur with\nthe King.",
        "Now, before they sat down to play, Raja Sarkap fixed his stakes,–on\nthe first game, his kingdom; on the second, the wealth of the whole\nworld; and, on the third, his own head. So, likewise, Raja Rasalu fixed\nhis stakes,–on the first game, his arms; on the second, his horse;\nand, on the third, his own head.",
        "Then they began to play, and it fell to Rasalu’s lot to make the first\nmove. Now he, forgetful of the dead man’s warning, played with the dice\ngiven him by Raja Sarkap, besides which, Sarkap let loose his famous\nrat, Dhol Raja, and it ran about the board, upsetting the chaupur\npieces on the sly, so that Rasalu lost the first game, and gave up his\nshining armour.",
        "Then the second game began, and once more Dhol Raja, the rat, upset the\npieces; and Rasalu, losing the game, gave up his faithful steed. Then\nBhaunr, the Arab steed, who stood by, found voice, and cried to his\nmaster,",
        "  “Sea-born am I, bought with much gold;\n  Dear Prince! trust me now as of old.\n  I’ll carry you far from these wiles–\n  My flight, all unspurr’d, will be swift as a bird,\n  For thousands and thousands of miles!\n  Or if needs you must stay; ere the next game you play,\n  Place hand in your pocket, I pray!”",
        "Hearing this, Raja Sarkap frowned, and bade his slaves remove Bhaunr,\nthe Arab steed, since he gave his master advice in the game. Now, when\nthe slaves came to lead the faithful steed away, Rasalu could not\nrefrain from tears, thinking over the long years during which Bhaunr,\nthe Arab steed, had been his companion. But the horse cried out again,",
        "  “Weep not, dear Prince! I shall not eat my bread\n  Of stranger hands, nor to strange stall be led.\n  Take thy right hand, and place it as I said.”",
        "These words roused some recollection in Rasalu’s mind, and when, just\nat this moment, the kitten in his pocket began to struggle, he\nremembered all about the warning, and the dice made from dead men’s\nbones. Then his heart rose up once more, and he called boldly to Raja\nSarkap, “Leave my horse and arms here for the present. Time enough to\ntake them away when you have won my head!”",
        "Now, Raja Sarkap, seeing Rasalu’s confident bearing, began to be\nafraid, and ordered all the women of his palace to come forth in their\ngayest attire and stand before Rasalu, so as to distract his attention\nfrom the game. But he never even looked at them, and drawing the dice\nfrom his pocket, said to Sarkap, “We have played with your dice all\nthis time; now we will play with mine.”",
        "Then the kitten went and sat at the window through which the rat Dhol\nRaja used to come, and the game began.",
        "After a while, Sarkap, seeing Raja Rasalu was winning, called to his\nrat, but when Dhol Raja saw the kitten he was afraid, and would not go\nfurther. So Rasalu won, and took back his arms. Next he played for his\nhorse, and once more Raja Sarkap called for his rat; but Dhol Raja,\nseeing the kitten keeping watch, was afraid. So Rasalu won the second\nstake, and took back Bhaunr, the Arab steed.",
        "Then Sarkap brought all his skill to bear on the third and last game,\nsaying,",
        "  “Oh moulded pieces! favour me to-day!\n  For sooth this is a man with whom I play.\n  No paltry risk–but life and death at stake;\n  As Sarkap does, so do, for Sarkap’s sake!”",
        "But Rasalu answered back,",
        "  “Oh moulded pieces! favour me to-day!\n  For sooth it is a man with whom I play.\n  No paltry risk–but life and death at stake;\n  As Heaven does, so do, for Heaven’s sake!”",
        "So they began to play, whilst the women stood round in a circle, and\nthe kitten watched Dhol Raja from the window. Then Sarkap lost, first\nhis kingdom, then the wealth of the whole world, and lastly his head.",
        "Just then, a servant came in to announce the birth of a daughter to\nRaja Sarkap, and he, overcome by misfortunes, said, “Kill her at once!\nfor she has been born in an evil moment, and has brought her father ill\nluck!”",
        "But Rasalu rose up in his shining armour, tender-hearted and strong,\nsaying, “Not so, oh king! She has done no evil. Give me this child to\nwife; and if you will vow, by all you hold sacred, never again to play\nchaupur for another’s head, I will spare yours now!”",
        "Then Sarkap vowed a solemn vow never to play for another’s head; and\nafter that he took a fresh mango branch, and the new-born babe, and\nplacing them on a golden dish gave them to Rasalu.",
        "Now, as he left the palace, carrying with him the new-born babe and the\nmango branch, he met a band of prisoners, and they called out to him,",
        "  “A royal hawk art thou, oh King! the rest\n   But timid wild-fowl. Grant us our request,–\n   Unloose these chains, and live for ever blest!”",
        "And Raja Rasalu hearkened to them, and bade King Sarkap set them at\nliberty.",
        "Then he went to the Murti Hills, and placed the new-born babe, Kokilan,\nin an underground palace, and planted the mango branch at the door,\nsaying, “In twelve years the mango tree will blossom; then will I\nreturn and marry Kokilan.”",
        "And after twelve years, the mango tree began to flower, and Raja Rasalu\nmarried the Princess Kokilan, whom he won from Sarkap when he played\nchaupur with the King.",
        "At the same time, when Brahma-datta was reigning in Benares, the future\nBuddha was born one of a peasant family; and when he grew up, he gained\nhis living by tilling the ground.",
        "At that time a hawker used to go from place to place, trafficking in\ngoods carried by an ass. Now at each place he came to, when he took the\npack down from the ass’s back, he used to clothe him in a lion’s skin,\nand turn him loose in the rice and barley fields. And when the watchmen\nin the fields saw the ass, they dared not go near him, taking him for a\nlion.",
        "So one day the hawker stopped in a village; and whilst he was getting\nhis own breakfast cooked, he dressed the ass in a lion’s skin, and\nturned him loose in a barley-field. The watchmen in the field dared not\ngo up to him; but going home, they published the news. Then all the\nvillagers came out with weapons in their hands; and blowing chanks, and\nbeating drums, they went near the field and shouted. Terrified with the\nfear of death, the ass uttered a cry–the bray of an ass!",
        "And when he knew him then to be an ass, the future Buddha pronounced\nthe First Verse:",
        "  “This is not a lion’s roaring,\n  Nor a tiger’s, nor a panther’s;\n  Dressed in a lion’s skin,\n  ’Tis a wretched ass that roars!”",
        "But when the villagers knew the creature to be an ass, they beat him\ntill his bones broke; and, carrying off the lion’s skin, went away.\nThen the hawker came; and seeing the ass fallen into so bad a plight,\npronounced the Second Verse:",
        "  “Long might the ass,\n  Clad in a lion’s skin,\n  Have fed on the barley green.\n  But he brayed!\n  And that moment he came to ruin.”",
        "And even whilst he was yet speaking the ass died on the spot!",
        "There was once a farmer who suffered much at the hands of a money-\nlender. Good harvests, or bad, the farmer was always poor, the money-\nlender rich. At the last, when he hadn’t a farthing left, farmer went\nto the money-lender’s house, and said, “You can’t squeeze water from a\nstone, and as you have nothing to get by me now, you might tell me the\nsecret of becoming rich.”",
        "“My friend,” returned the money-lender, piously, “riches come from Ram\n–ask him.”",
        "“Thank you, I will!” replied the simple farmer; so he prepared three\ngirdle-cakes to last him on the journey, and set out to find Ram.",
        "First he met a Brahman, and to him he gave a cake, asking him to point\nout the road to Ram; but the Brahman only took the cake and went on his\nway without a word, Next the farmer met a Jogi or devotee, and to him\nhe gave a cake, without receiving any help in return. At last, he came\nupon a poor man sitting under a tree, and finding out he was hungry,\nthe kindly farmer gave him his last cake, and sitting down to rest\nbeside him, entered into conversation.",
        "“And where are you going?” asked the poor man, at length.",
        "“Oh, I have a long journey before me, for I am going to find Ram!\"\nreplied the farmer. “I don’t suppose you could tell me which way to\ngo?”",
        "“Perhaps I can,” said the poor man, smiling, “for I am Ram! What\ndo you want of me?”",
        "Then the farmer told the whole story, and Ram, taking pity on him, gave\nhim a conch shell, and showed him how to blow it in a particular way,\nsaying, “Remember! whatever you wish for, you have only to blow the\nconch that way, and your wish will be fulfilled. Only have a care of\nthat money-lender, for even magic is not proof against their wiles!”",
        "The farmer went back to his village rejoicing. In fact the money-lender\nnoticed his high spirits at once, and said to himself, “Some good\nfortune must have befallen the stupid fellow, to make him hold his head\nso jauntily.” Therefore he went over to the simple farmer’s house, and\ncongratulated him on his good fortune, in such cunning words,\npretending to have heard all about it, that before long the farmer\nfound himself telling the whole story–all except the secret of blowing\nthe conch, for, with all his simplicity, the farmer was not quite such\na fool as to tell that.",
        "Nevertheless, the money-lender determined to have the conch by hook or\nby crook, and as he was villain enough not to stick at trifles, he\nwaited for a favourable opportunity and stole the conch.",
        "But, after nearly bursting himself with blowing the conch in every\nconceivable way, he was obliged to give up the secret as a bad job.\nHowever, being determined to succeed he went back to the farmer, and\nsaid, coolly, “Look here; I’ve got your conch, but I can’t use it; you\nhaven’t got it, so it’s clear you can’t use it either. Business is at a\nstand-still unless we make a bargain. Now, I promise to give you back\nyour conch, and never to interfere with your using it, on one\ncondition, which is this,–whatever you get from it, I am to get\ndouble.”",
        "“Never!” cried the farmer; “that would be the old business all over\nagain!”",
        "“Not at all!” replied the wily money-lender; “you will have your share!\nNow, don’t be a dog in the manger, for if you get all you want,\nwhat can it matter to you if I am rich or poor?”",
        "At last, though it went sorely against the grain to be of any benefit\nto a money-lender, the farmer was forced to yield, and from that time,\nno matter what he gained by the power of the conch, the money-lender\ngained double. And the knowledge that this was so preyed upon the\nfarmer’s mind day and night, so that he had no satisfaction out of\nanything.",
        "At last, there came a very dry season,–so dry that the farmer’s crops\nwithered for want of rain. Then he blew his conch, and wished for a\nwell to water them, and lo! there was the well, but the money-lender\nhad two!–two beautiful new wells! This was too much for any farmer\nto stand; and our friend brooded over it, and brooded over it, till at\nlast a bright idea came into his head. He seized the conch, blew it\nloudly, and cried out, “Oh, Ram! I wish to be blind of one eye!” And so\nhe, was, in a twinkling, but the money-lender of course was blind of\nboth, and in trying to steer his way between the two new wells, he fell\ninto one, and was drowned.",
        "Now this true story shows that a farmer once got the better of a money-\nlender–but only by losing one of his eyes.",
        "In a country were seven daughters of poor parents, who used to come\ndaily to play under the shady trees in the King’s garden with the\ngardener’s daughter; and daily she used to say to them, “When I am\nmarried I shall have a son. Such a beautiful boy as he will be has\nnever been seen. He will have a moon on his forehead and a star on his\nchin.” Then her playfellows used to laugh at her and mock her.",
        "But one day the King heard her telling them about the beautiful boy she\nwould have when she was married, and he said to himself he should like\nvery much to have such a son; the more so that though he had already\nfour Queens he had no child. He went, therefore, to the gardener and\ntold him he wished to marry his daughter. This delighted the gardener\nand his wife, who thought it would indeed be grand for their daughter\nto become a princess. So they said “Yes” to the King, and invited all\ntheir friends to the wedding. The King invited all his, and he gave the\ngardener as much money as he wanted. Then the wedding was held with\ngreat feasting and rejoicing.",
        "A year later the day drew near on which the gardener’s daughter was to\nhave her son; and the King’s four other Queens came constantly to see\nher. One day they said to her, “The King hunts every day; and the time\nis soon coming when you will have your child. Suppose you fell ill\nwhilst he was out hunting and could therefore know nothing of your\nillness, what would you do then?”",
        "When the King came home that evening, the gardener’s daughter said to\nhim, “Every day you go out hunting. Should I ever be in trouble or sick\nwhile you are away, how could I send for you?” The King gave her a\nkettle-drum which he placed near the door for her, and he said to her,\n\"Whenever you want me, beat this kettle-drum. No matter how far away I\nmay be, I shall hear it, and will come at once to you.”",
        "Next morning when the King had gone out to hunt, his four other Queens\ncame to see the gardener’s daughter. She told them all about her\nkettle-drum. “Oh,” they said, “do drum on it just to see if the King\nreally will come to you.”",
        "“No, I will not,” she said; “for why should I call him from his hunting\nwhen I do not want him?”",
        "“Don’t mind interrupting his hunting,” they answered. “Do try if he\nreally will come to you when you beat your kettle-drum.” So at last,\njust to please them, she beat it, and the King stood before her.",
        "“Why have you called me?” he said. “See, I have left my hunting to come\nto you.”",
        "“I want nothing,” she answered; “I only wished to know if you really\nwould come to me when I beat my drum.”",
        "“Very well,” answered the King; “but do not call me again unless you\nreally need me.” Then he returned to his hunting.",
        "The next day, when the King had gone out hunting as usual, the four\nQueens again came to see the gardener’s daughter. They begged and\nbegged her to beat her drum once more, “just to see if the King will\nreally come to see you this time.” At first she refused, but at last\nshe consented. So she beat her drum, and the King came to her. But when\nhe found she was neither ill nor in trouble, he was angry, and said to\nher, “Twice I have left my hunting and lost my game to come to you when\nyou did not need me. Now you may call me as much as you like, but I\nwill not come to you,” and then he went away in a rage.",
        "The third day the gardener’s daughter fell ill, and she beat and beat\nher kettle-drum; but the King never came. He heard her kettle-drum, but\nhe thought, “She does not really want me; she is only trying to see if\nI will go to her.”",
        "Meanwhile the four other Queens came to her, and they said, “Here it is\nthe custom before a child is born to bind its mother’s eyes with a\nhandkerchief that she may not see it just at first. So let us bind your\neyes.” She answered, “Very well, bind my eyes.” The four wives then\ntied a handkerchief over them.",
        "Soon after, the gardener’s daughter had a beautiful little son, with a\nmoon on his forehead and a star on his chin, and before the poor mother\nhad seen him, the four wicked Queens took the boy to the nurse and said\nto her, “Now you must not let this child make the least sound for fear\nhis mother should hear him; and in the night you must either kill him,\nor else take him away, so that his mother may never see him. If you\nobey our orders, we will give you a great many rupees.” All this they\ndid out of spite. The nurse took the little child and put him into a\nbox, and the four Queens went back to the gardener’s daughter.",
        "First they put a stone into her boy’s little bed, and then they took\nthe handkerchief off her eyes and showed it her, saying, “Look! this is\nyour son!” The poor girl cried bitterly, and thought, “What will the\nKing say when he finds no child?” But she could do nothing.",
        "When the King came home; he was furious at hearing his youngest wife,\nthe gardener’s daughter, had given him a stone instead of the beautiful\nlittle son she had promised him. He made her one of the palace\nservants, and never spoke to her.",
        "In the middle of the night the nurse took the box in which was the\nbeautiful little prince, and went out to a broad plain in the jungle.\nThere she dug a hole, made the fastenings of the box sure, and put the\nbox into the hole, although the child in it was still alive. The King’s\ndog, whose name was Shankar, had followed her to see what she did with\nthe box. As soon as she had gone back to the four Queens (who gave her\na great many rupees), the dog went to the hole in which she had put the\nbox, took the box out, and opened it. When he saw the beautiful little\nboy, he was very much delighted and said, “If it pleases Khuda that\nthis child should live, I will not hurt him; I will not eat him, but I\nwill swallow him whole and hide him in my stomach.” This he did.",
        "After six months had passed, the dog went by night to the jungle, and\nthought, “I wonder whether the boy is alive or dead.” Then he brought\nthe child out of his stomach and rejoiced over his beauty. The boy was\nnow six months old. When Shankar had caressed and loved him, he\nswallowed him again for another six months. At the end of that time he\nwent once more by night to the broad jungle-plain. There he brought up\nthe child out of his stomach (the child was now a year old), and\ncaressed and petted him a great deal, and was made very happy by his\ngreat beauty.",
        "But this time the dog’s keeper had followed and watched the dog; and he\nsaw all that Shankar did, and the beautiful little child, so he ran to\nthe four Queens and said to them, “Inside the King’s dog there is a\nchild! the loveliest child! He has a moon on his forehead and a star on\nhis chin. Such a child has never been seen!” At this the four wives\nwere very much frightened, and as soon as the King came home from\nhunting they said to him, “While you were away your dog came to our\nrooms, and tore our clothes and knocked about all our things. We are\nafraid he will kill us.” “Do not be afraid,” said the King. “Eat your\ndinner and be happy. I will have the dog shot to-morrow morning.”",
        "Then he ordered his servants to shoot the dog at dawn, but the dog\nheard him, and said to himself, “What shall I do? The King intends to\nkill me. I don’t care about that, but what will become of the child if\nI am killed? He will die. But I will see if I cannot save him.”",
        "So when it was night, the dog ran to the King’s cow, who was called\nSuri, and said to her, “Suri, I want to give you something, for the\nKing has ordered me to be shot to-morrow. Will you take great care of\nwhatever I give you?”",
        "“Let me see what it is,” said Suri, “I will take care of it if I can.\"\nThen they both went together to the wide plain, and there the dog\nbrought up the boy. Suri was enchanted with him. “I never saw such a\nbeautiful child in this country,” she said. “See, he has a moon on his\nforehead and a star on his chin. I will take the greatest care of him.\"\nSo saying she swallowed the little prince. The dog made her a great\nmany salaams, and said, “To-morrow I shall die;” and the cow then went\nback to her stable.",
        "Next morning at dawn the dog was taken to the jungle and shot.",
        "The child now lived in Suri’s stomach; and when one whole year had\npassed, and he was two years old, the cow went out to the plain, and\nsaid to herself, “I do not know whether the child is alive or dead. But\nI have never hurt it, so I will see.” Then she brought up the boy; and\nhe played about, and Suri was delighted; she loved him and caressed\nhim, and talked to him. Then she swallowed him, and returned to her\nstable.",
        "At the end of another year she went again to the plain and brought up\nthe child. He played and ran about for an hour to her great delight,\nand she talked to him and caressed him. His great beauty made her very\nhappy. Then she swallowed him once more and returned to her stable. The\nchild was now three years old.",
        "But this time the cowherd had followed Suri, and had seen the wonderful\nchild and all she did to it. So he ran and told the four Queens, “The\nKing’s cow has a beautiful boy inside her. He has a moon on his\nforehead and a star on his chin. Such a child has never been seen\nbefore!”",
        "At this the Queens were terrified. They tore their clothes and their\nhair and cried. When the King came home at evening, he asked them why\nthey were so agitated. “Oh,” they said, “your cow came and tried to\nkill us; but we ran away. She tore our hair and our clothes.” “Never\nmind,” said the King. “Eat your dinner and be happy. The cow shall be\nkilled to-morrow morning.”",
        "Now Suri heard the King give this order to the servants, so she said to\nherself, “What shall I do to save the child?” When it was midnight, she\nwent to the King’s horse called Katar, who was very wicked, and quite\nuntameable. No one had ever been able to ride him; indeed no one could\ngo near him with safety, he was so savage. Suri said to this horse,\n\"Katar, will you take care of something that I want to give you,\nbecause the King has ordered me to be killed to-morrow?”",
        "“Good,” said Katar; “show me what it is.” Then Suri brought up the\nchild, and the horse was delighted with him. “Yes,” he said, “I will\ntake the greatest care of him. Till now no one has been able to ride\nme, but this child shall ride me.” Then he swallowed the boy, and when\nhe had done so, the cow made him many salaams, saying, “It is for this\nboy’s sake that I am to die.” The next morning she was taken to the\njungle and there killed.",
        "The beautiful boy now lived in the horse’s stomach, and he stayed in it\nfor one whole year. At the end of that time the horse thought, “I will\nsee if this child is alive or dead.” So he brought him up; and then he\nloved him, and petted him, and the little prince played all about the\nstable, out of which the horse was never allowed to go. Katar was very\nglad to see the child, who was now four years old. After he had played\nfor some time, the horse swallowed him again. At the end of another\nyear, when the boy was five years old, Katar brought him up again,\ncaressed him, loved him, and let him play about the stable as he had\ndone a year before. Then the horse swallowed him again.",
        "But this time the groom had seen all that happened, and when it was\nmorning, and the King had gone away to his hunting, he went to the four\nwicked Queens, and told them all he had seen, and all about the\nwonderful, beautiful child that lived inside the King’s horse Katar. On\nhearing the groom’s story the four Queens cried, and tore their hair\nand clothes, and refused to eat. When the King returned at evening and\nasked them why they were so miserable, they said, “Your horse Katar\ncame and tore our clothes, and upset all our things, and we ran away\nfor fear he should kill us.”",
        "“Never mind,” said the King. “Only eat your dinner and be happy. I will\nhave Katar shot to-morrow.” Then he thought that two men unaided could\nnot kill such a wicked horse, so he ordered his servants to bid his\ntroop of sepoys shoot him.",
        "So the next day the King placed his sepoys all round the stable, and he\ntook up his stand with them; and he said he would himself shoot any one\nwho let his horse escape.",
        "Meanwhile the horse had overheard all these orders. So he brought up\nthe child and said to him, “Go into that little room that leads out of\nthe stable, and you will find in it a saddle and bridle which you must\nput on me. Then you will find in the room some beautiful clothes such\nas princes wear; these you must put on yourself; and you must take the\nsword and gun you will find there too. Then you must mount on my back.\"\nNow Katar was a fairy-horse, and came from the fairies’ country, so he\ncould get anything he wanted; but neither the King nor any of his\npeople knew this.",
        "When all was ready, Katar burst out of his stable, with the prince on\nhis back, rushed past the King himself before the King had time to\nshoot him, galloped away to the great jungle-plain, and galloped about\nall over it. The King saw his horse had a boy on his back, though he\ncould not see the boy distinctly. The sepoys tried in vain to shoot the\nhorse; he galloped much too fast; and at last they were all scattered\nover the plain. Then the King had to give it up and go home; and the\nsepoys went to their homes. The King could not shoot any of his sepoys\nfor letting his horse escape, for he himself had let him do so.",
        "Then Katar galloped away, on, and on, and on; and when night came they\nstayed under a tree, he and the King’s son. The horse ate grass, and\nthe boy wild fruits which he found in the jungle. Next morning they\nstarted afresh, and went far, and far, till they came to a jungle in\nanother country, which did not belong to the little prince’s father,\nbut to another king. Here Katar said to the boy, “Now get off my back.\"\nOff jumped the prince. “Unsaddle me and take off my bridle; take off\nyour beautiful clothes and tie them all up in a bundle with your sword\nand gun.” This the boy did. Then the horse gave him some poor, common\nclothes, which he told him to put on. As soon as he was dressed in them\nthe horse said, “Hide your bundle in this grass, and I will take care\nof it for you. I will always stay in this jungle-plain, so that when\nyou want me you will always find me. You must now go away and find\nservice with some one in this country.”",
        "This made the boy very sad. “I know nothing about anything,” he said.\n\"What shall I do all alone in this country?”",
        "“Do not be afraid,” answered Katar. “You will find service, and I will\nalways stay here to help you when you want me. So go, only before you\ngo, twist my right ear.” The boy did so, and his horse instantly became\na donkey. “Now twist your right ear,” said Katar. And when the boy had\ntwisted it, he was no longer a handsome prince, but a poor, common-\nlooking, ugly man; and his moon and star were hidden.",
        "Then he went away further into the country, until he came to a grain\nmerchant of the country, who asked him who he was. “I am a poor man,\"\nanswered the boy, “and I want service.” “Good,” said the grain\nmerchant, “you shall be my servant.”",
        "Now the grain merchant lived near the King’s palace, and one night at\ntwelve o’clock the boy was very hot; so he went out into the King’s\ncool garden, and began to sing a lovely song. The seventh and youngest\ndaughter of the King heard him, and she wondered who it was who could\nsing so deliciously. Then she put on her clothes, rolled up her hair,\nand came down to where the seemingly poor common man was lying singing.\n\"Who are you? where do you come from?” she asked.",
        "But he answered nothing.",
        "“Who is this man who does not answer when I speak to him?” thought the\nlittle princess, and she went away. On the second night the same thing\nhappened, and on the third night too. But on the third night, when she\nfound she could not make him answer her, she said to him, “What a\nstrange man you are not to answer me when I speak to you.” But still he\nremained silent, so she went away.",
        "The next day, when he had finished his work, the young prince went to\nthe jungle to see his horse, who asked him, “Are you quite well and\nhappy?” “Yes, I am,” answered the boy. “I am servant to a grain\nmerchant. The last three nights I have gone into the King’s garden and\nsung a song, and each night the youngest princess has come to me and\nasked me who I am, and whence I came, and I have answered nothing. What\nshall I do now?” The horse said, “Next time she asks you who you are,\ntell her you are a very poor man, and came from your own country to\nfind service here.”",
        "The boy then went home to the grain merchant, and at night, when every\none had gone to bed, he went to the King’s garden and sang his sweet\nsong again. The youngest princess heard him, got up, dressed, and came\nto him. “Who are you? Whence do you come?” she asked.",
        "“I am a very poor man,” he answered. “I came from my own country to\nseek service here, and I am now one of the grain merchant’s servants.\"\nThen she went away. For three more nights the boy sang in the King’s\ngarden, and each night the princess came and asked him the same\nquestions as before, and the boy gave her the same answers.",
        "Then she went to her father, and said to him, “Father, I wish to be\nmarried; but I must choose my husband myself.” Her father consented to\nthis, and he wrote and invited all the Kings and Rajas in the land,\nsaying, “My youngest daughter wishes to be married, but she insists on\nchoosing her husband herself. As I do not know who it is she wishes to\nmarry, I beg you will all come on a certain day, for her to see you and\nmake her choice.”",
        "A great many Kings, Rajas, and their sons accepted this invitation and\ncame. When they had all arrived, the little princess’s father said to\nthem, “To-morrow morning you must all sit together in my garden” (the\nKing’s garden was very large), “for then my youngest daughter will come\nand see you all, and choose her husband. I do not know whom she will\nchoose.”",
        "The youngest princess ordered a grand elephant to be ready for her the\nnext morning, and when the morning came, and all was ready, she dressed\nherself in the most lovely clothes, and put on her beautiful jewels;\nthen she mounted her elephant, which was painted blue. In her hand she\ntook a gold necklace.",
        "Then she went into the garden where the Kings, Rajas, and their sons\nwere seated. The boy, the grain merchant’s servant, was also in the\ngarden: not as a suitor, but looking on with the other servants.",
        "The princess rode all round the garden, and looked at all the Kings and\nRajas and princes, and then she hung the gold necklace round the neck\nof the boy, the grain merchant’s servant. At this everybody laughed,\nand the Kings were greatly astonished. But then they and the Rajas\nsaid, “What fooling is this?” and they pushed the pretended poor man\naway, and took the necklace off his neck, and said to him, “Get out of\nthe way, you poor, dirty man. Your clothes are far too dirty for you to\ncome near us!” The boy went far away from them, and stood a long way\noff to see what would happen.",
        "Then the King’s youngest daughter went all round the garagain, holding\nher gold necklace in her hand, and once more she hung it round the\nboy’s neck. Every one laughed at her and said, “How can the King’s\ndaughter think of marrying this poor, common man!” and the Kings and\nthe Rajas, who had come as suitors, all wanted to turn him out of the\ngarden. But the princess said, “Take care! take care! You must not turn\nhim out. Leave him alone.” Then she put him on her elephant, and took\nhim to the palace.",
        "The Kings and Rajas and their sons were very much astonished, and said,\n\"What does this mean? The princess does not care to marry one of us,\nbut chooses that very poor man!” Her father then stood up, and said to\nthem all, “I promised my daughter she should marry any one she pleased,\nand as she has twice chosen that poor, common man, she shall marry\nhim.” And so the princess and the boy were married with great pomp and\nsplendour: her father and mother were quite content with her choice;\nand the Kings, the Rajas and their sons, all returned to their homes.",
        "Now the princess’s six sisters had all married rich princes, and they\nlaughed at her for choosing such a poor ugly husband as hers seemed to\nbe, and said to each other, mockingly, “See! our sister has married\nthis poor, common man!” Their six husbands used to go out hunting every\nday, and every evening they brought home quantities of all kinds of\ngame to their wives, and the game was cooked for their dinner and for\nthe King’s; but the husband of the youngest princess always stayed at\nhome in the palace, and never went out hunting at all. This made her\nvery sad, and she said to herself, “My sisters’ husbands hunt every\nday, but my husband never hunts at all.”",
        "At last she said to him, “Why do you never go out hunting as my\nsisters’ husbands do every day, and every day they bring home\nquantities of all kinds of game? Why do you always stay at home,\ninstead of doing as they do?”",
        "One day he said to her, “I am going out to-day to eat the air.”",
        "“Very good,” she answered; “go, and take one of the horses.”",
        "“No,” said the young prince, “I will not ride, I will walk.” Then he\nwent to the jungle-plain where he had left Katar, who all this time had\nseemed to be a donkey, and he told Katar everything. “Listen,” he said;\n\"I have married the youngest princess; and when we were married\neverybody laughed at her for choosing me, and said, ’What a very poor,\ncommon man our princess has chosen for her husband!’ Besides, my wife\nis very sad, for her six sisters’ husbands all hunt every day, and\nbring home quantities of game, and their wives therefore are very proud\nof them. But I stay at home all day, and never hunt. To-day I should\nlike to hunt very much.”",
        "“Well,” said Katar, “then twist my left ear;” and as soon as the boy\nhad twisted it, Katar was a horse again, and not a donkey any longer.\n\"Now,” said Katar, “twist your left ear, and you will see what a\nbeautiful young prince you will become.” So the boy twisted his own\nleft ear, and there he stood no longer a poor, common, ugly man, but a\ngrand young prince with a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.\nThen he put on his splendid clothes, saddled and bridled Katar, got on\nhis back with his sword and gun, and rode off to hunt.",
        "He rode very far, and shot a great many birds and a quantity of deer.\nThat day his six brothers-in-law could find no game, for the beautiful\nyoung prince had shot it all. Nearly all the day long these six princes\nwandered about looking in vain for game; till at last they grew hungry\nand thirsty, and could find no water, and they had no food with them.\nMeanwhile the beautiful young prince had sat down under a tree, to dine\nand rest, and there his six brothers-in-law found him. By his side was\nsome delicious water, and also some roast meat.",
        "When they saw him the six princes said to each other, “Look at that\nhandsome prince. He has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.\nWe have never seen such a prince in this jungle before; he must come\nfrom another country.” Then they came up to him, and made him many\nsalaams, and begged him to give them some food and water. “Who are\nyou?” said the young prince. “We are the husbands of the six elder\ndaughters of the King of this country,” they answered; “and we have\nhunted all day, and are very hungry and thirsty.” They did not\nrecognise their brother-in-law in the least.",
        "“Well,” said the young prince, “I will give you something to eat and\ndrink if you will do as I bid you.” “We will do all you tell us to do,\"\nthey answered, “for if we do not get water to drink, we shall die.\"\n\"Very good,” said the young prince. “Now you must let me put a red-hot\npice on the back of each of you, and then I will give you food and\nwater. Do you agree to this?” The six princes consented, for they\nthought, “No one will ever see the mark of the pice, as it will be\ncovered by our clothes; and we shall die if we have no water to drink.\"\nThen the young prince took six pice, and made them red-hot in the fire;\nhe laid one on the back of each of the six princes, and gave them good\nfood and water. They ate and drank; and when they had finished they\nmade him many salaams and went home.",
        "The young prince stayed under the tree till it was evening; then he\nmounted his horse and rode off to the King’s palace. All the people\nlooked at him as he came riding along, saying, “What a splendid young\nprince that is! He has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.\"\nBut no one recognised him. When he came near the King’s palace, all the\nKing’s servants asked him who he was; and as none of them knew him, the\ngate-keepers would not let him pass in. They all wondered who he could\nbe, and all thought him the most beautiful prince that had ever been\nseen.",
        "At last they asked him who he was. “I am the husband of your youngest\nprincess,” he answered.",
        "“No, no, indeed you are not,” they said; “for he is a poor, common-\nlooking, and ugly man.”",
        "“But I am he,” answered the prince; only no one would believe him.",
        "“Tell us the truth,” said the servants; “who are you?”",
        "“Perhaps you cannot recognise me,” said the young prince, “but call the\nyoungest princess here. I wish to speak to her.” The servants called\nher, and she came. “That man is not my husband,” she said at once. “My\nhusband is not nearly as handsome as that man. This must be a prince\nfrom another country.”",
        "Then she said to him, “Who are you? Why do you say you are my husband?”",
        "“Because I am your husband. I am telling you the truth,” answered the\nyoung prince.",
        "“No you are not, you are not telling me the truth,” said the little\nprincess. “My husband is not a handsome man like you. I married a very\npoor, common-looking man.”",
        "“That is true,” he answered, “but nevertheless I am your husband. I was\nthe grain merchant’s servant; and one hot night I went into your\nfather’s garden and sang, and you heard me, and came and asked me who I\nwas and where I came from, and I would not answer you. And the same\nthing happened the next night, and the next, and on the fourth I told\nyou I was a very poor man, and had come from my country to seek service\nin yours, and that I was the grain merchant’s servant. Then you told\nyour father you wished to marry, but must choose your own husband; and\nwhen all the Kings and Rajas were seated in your father’s garden, you\nsat on an elephant and went round and looked at them all; and then\ntwice hung your gold necklace round my neck, and chose me. See, here is\nyour necklace, and here are the ring and the handkerchief you gave me\non our wedding day.”",
        "Then she believed him, and was very glad that her husband was such a\nbeautiful young prince. “What a strange man you are!” she said to him.\n\"Till now you have been poor, and ugly, and common-looking. Now you are\nbeautiful and look like a prince; I never saw such a handsome man as\nyou are before; and yet I know you must be my husband.” Then she\nworshipped God and thanked him for letting her have such a husband. “I\nhave,” she said, “a beautiful husband. There is no one like him in this\ncountry. He has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.” Then\nshe took him into the palace, and showed him to her father and mother\nand to every one. They all said they had never seen any one like him,\nand were all very happy. And the young prince lived as before in the\nKing’s palace with his wife, and Katar lived in the King’s stables.",
        "One day, when the King and his seven sons-in-law were in his court-\nhouse, and it was full of people, the young prince said to him, “There\nare six thieves here in your court-house.” “Six thieves!” said the\nKing. “Where are they? Show them to me.” “There they are,” said the\nyoung prince, pointing to his six brothers-in-law. The King and every\none else in the court-house were very much astonished, and would not\nbelieve the young prince. “Take off their coats,” he said, “and then\nyou will see for yourselves that each of them has the mark of a thief\non his back.” So their coats were taken off the six princes, and the\nKing and everybody in the court-house saw the mark of the red-hot pice.\nThe six princes were very much ashamed, but the young prince was very\nglad. He had not forgotten how his brothers-in-law had laughed at him\nand mocked him when he seemed a poor, common man.",
        "Now, when Katar was still in the jungle, before the prince was married,\nhe had told the boy the whole story of his birth, and all that had\nhappened to him and his mother. “When you are married,” he said to him,\n\"I will take you back to your father’s country.” So two months after\nthe young prince had revenged himself on his brothers-in-law, Katar\nsaid to him, “It is time for you to return to your father. Get the King\nto let you go to your own country, and I will tell you what to do when\nwe get there.”",
        "The prince always did what his horse told him to do; so he went to his\nwife and said to her, “I wish very much to go to my own country to see\nmy father and mother.” “Very well,” said his wife; “I will tell my\nfather and mother, and ask them to let us go.” Then she went to them,\nand told them, and they consented to let her and her husband leave\nthem. The King gave his daughter and the young prince a great many\nhorses, and elephants, and all sorts of presents, and also a great many\nsepoys to guard them. In this grand state they travelled to the\nprince’s country, which was not a great many miles off. When they\nreached it they pitched their tents on the same plain in which the\nprince had been left in his box by the nurse, where Shankar and Suri\nhad swallowed him so often.",
        "When the King, his father, the gardener’s daughter’s husband, saw the\nprince’s camp, he was very much alarmed, and thought a great King had\ncome to make war on him. He sent one of his servants, therefore, to ask\nwhose camp it was. The young prince then wrote him a letter, in which\nhe said, “You are a great King. Do not fear me. I am not come to make\nwar on you. I am as if I were your son. I am a prince who has come to\nsee your country and to speak with you. I wish to give you a grand\nfeast, to which every one in your country must come–men and women, old\nand young, rich and poor, of all castes; all the children, fakirs, and\nsepoys. You must bring them all here to me for a week, and I will feast\nthem all.”",
        "The King was delighted with this letter, and ordered all the men,\nwomen, and children of all castes, fakirs, and sepoys, in his country\nto go to the prince’s camp to a grand feast the prince would give them.\nSo they all came, and the King brought his four wives too. All came, at\nleast all but the gardener’s daughter. No one had told her to go to the\nfeast, for no one had thought of her.",
        "When all the people were assembled, the prince saw his mother was not\nthere, and he asked the King, “Has every one in your country come to my\nfeast?”",
        "“Yes, every one,” said the King.",
        "“Are you sure of that?” asked the prince.",
        "“Quite sure,” answered the King.",
        "“I am sure one woman has not come,” said the prince. “She is your\ngardener’s daughter, who was once your wife and is now a servant in\nyour palace.”",
        "“True,” said the King, “I had forgotten her.” Then the prince told his\nservants to take his finest palanquin and to fetch the gardener’s\ndaughter. They were to bathe her, dress her in beautiful clothes and\nhandsome jewels, and then bring her to him in the palanquin.",
        "While the servants were bringing the gardener’s daughter, the King\nthought how handsome the young prince was; and he noticed particularly\nthe moon on his forehead and the star on his chin, and he wondered in\nwhat country the young prince was born.",
        "And now the palanquin arrived bringing the gardener’s daughter, and the\nyoung prince went himself and took her out of it, and brought her into\nthe tent. He made her a great many salaams. The four wicked wives\nlooked on and were very much surprised and very angry. They remembered\nthat, when they arrived, the prince had made them no salaams, and since\nthen had not taken the least notice of them; whereas he could not do\nenough for the gardener’s daughter, and seemed very glad to see her.",
        "When they were all at dinner, the prince again made the gardener’s\ndaughter a great many salaams, and gave her food from all the nicest\ndishes. She wondered at his kindness to her, and thought, “Who is this\nhandsome prince, with a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin? I\nnever saw any one so beautiful. What country does he come from?”",
        "Two or three days were thus passed in feasting, and all that time the\nKing and his people were talking about the prince’s beauty, and\nwondering who he was.",
        "One day the prince asked the King if he had any children. “None,” he\nanswered.",
        "“Do you know who I am?” asked the prince.",
        "“No,” said the King. “Tell me who you are.”",
        "“I am your son,” answered the prince, “and the gardener’s daughter is\nmy mother.”",
        "The King shook his head sadly. “How can you be my son,” he said, “when\nI have never had any children?”",
        "“But I am your son,” answered the prince. “Your four wicked Queens told\nyou the gardener’s daughter had given you a stone and not a son; but it\nwas they who put the stone in my little bed, and then they tried to\nkill me.”",
        "The King did not believe him. “I wish you were my son,” he said; “but as\nI never had a child, you cannot be my son.” “Do you remember your dog\nShankar, and how you had him killed? And do you remember your cow Suri,\nand how you had her killed too? Your wives made you kill them because\nof me. And,” he said, taking the King to Katar, “do you know whose\nhorse that is?”",
        "The King looked at Katar, and then said, “That is my horse, Katar.\"\n\"Yes,” said the prince. “Do you not remember how he rushed past you out\nof his stable with me on his back?” Then Katar told the King the prince\nwas really his son, and told him all the story of his birth, and of his\nlife up to that moment; and when the King found the beautiful prince\nwas indeed his son, he was so glad, so glad. He put his arms round him\nand kissed him and cried for joy.",
        "“Now,” said the King, “you must come with me to my palace, and live\nwith me always.”",
        "“No,” said the prince, “that I cannot do. I cannot go to your palace. I\nonly came here to fetch my mother; and now that I have found her, I\nwill take her with me to my father-in-law’s palace. I have married a\nKing’s daughter, and we live with her father.”",
        "“But now that I have found you, I cannot let you go,” said his father.\nYou and your wife must come and live with your mother and me in my\npalace.”",
        "“That we will never do,” said the prince, “unless you will kill your\nfour wicked Queens with your own hand. If you will do that, we will\ncome and live with you.”",
        "So the King killed his Queens, and then he and his wife, the gardener’s\ndaughter, and the prince and his wife, all went to live in the King’s\npalace, and lived there happily together for ever after; and the King\nthanked God for giving him such a beautiful son, and for ridding him of\nhis four wicked wives.",
        "Katar did not return to the fairies’ country, but stayed always with\nthe young prince, and never left him.",
        "There was once upon a time a King who had no children. Now this King\nwent and laid him down to rest at a place where four roads met, so that\nevery one who passed had to step over him.",
        "At last a Fakir came along, and he said to the King, “Man, why are you\nlying here?”",
        "He replied, “Fakir, a thousand men have come and passed by; you pass on\ntoo.”",
        "But the Fakir said, “Who are you, man?”",
        "The King replied, “I am a King, Fakir. Of goods and gold I have no\nlack, but I have lived long and have no children. So I have come here,\nand have laid me down at the cross-roads. My sins and offences have\nbeen very many, so I have come and am lying here that men may pass over\nme, and perchance my sins may be forgiven me, and God may be merciful,\nand I may have a son.”",
        "The Fakir answered him, “Oh King! If you have children, what will you\ngive me?”",
        "“Whatever you ask, Fakir,” answered the King. The Fakir said, “Of goods\nand gold I have no lack, but I will say a prayer for you, and you will\nhave two sons; one of those sons will be mine.”",
        "Then he took out two sweetmeats and handed them to the King, and said,\n\"King! take these two sweetmeats and give them to your wives; give them\nto the wives you love best.”",
        "The King took the sweetmeats and put them in his bosom.",
        "Then the Fakir said, “King! in a year I will return, and of the two\nsons who will be born to you one is mine and one yours.”",
        "The King said, “Well, I agree.”",
        "Then the Fakir went on his way, and the King came home and gave one\nsweetmeat to each of his two wives. After some time two sons were born\nto the King. Then what did the King do but place those two sons in an\nunderground room, which he had built in the earth.",
        "Some time passed, and one day the Fakir appeared, and said, “King!\nbring me that son of yours!”",
        "What did the King do but bring two slave-girls’ sons and present them\nto the Fakir. While the Fakir was sitting there the King’s sons were\nsitting down below in their cellar eating their food. Just then a\nhungry ant had carried away a grain of rice from their food, and was\ngoing along with it to her children. Another stronger ant came up and\nattacked her in order to get this grain of rice. The first ant said, “O\nant, why do you drag this away from me? I have long been lame in my\nfeet, and I have got just one grain, and am carrying it to my children.\nThe King’s sons are sitting in the cellar eating their food; you go and\nfetch a grain from there; why should you take mine from me?” On this\nthe second ant let go and did not rob the first, but went off to where\nthe King’s sons were eating their food.",
        "On hearing this the Fakir said, “King! these are not your sons; go and\nbring those children who are eating their food in the cellar.”",
        "Then the King went and brought his own sons. The Fakir chose the eldest\nson and took him away, and set off with him on his journey, When he got\nhome he told the King’s son to go out to gather fuel.",
        "So the King’s son went out to gather cow-dung, and when he had\ncollected some he brought it in.",
        "Then the Fakir looked at the King’s son and put on a great pot, and\nsaid, “Come round here, my pupil.”",
        "But the King’s son said, “Master first, and pupil after.”",
        "The Fakir told him to come once, he told him twice, he told him three\ntimes, and each time the King’s son answered, “Master first, and pupil\nafter.”",
        "Then the Fakir made a dash at the King’s son, thinking to catch him and\nthrow him into the caldron. There were about a hundred gallons of oil\nin this caldron, and the fire was burning beneath it. Then the King’s\nson, lifting the Fakir, gave him a jerk and threw him into the caldron,\nand he was burnt, and became roast meat. He then saw a key of the\nFakir’s lying there; he took this key and opened the door of the\nFakir’s house. Now many men were locked up in this house; two horses\nwere standing there in a hut of the Fakir’s; two greyhounds were tied\nup there; two simurgs were imprisoned, and two tigers also stood there.\nSo the King’s son let all the creatures go, and took them out of the\nhouse, and they all returned thanks to God. Next he let out all the men\nwho were in prison. He took away with him the two horses, and he took\naway the two tigers, and he took away the two hounds, and he took away\nthe two simurgs, and with them he set out for another country.",
        "As he went along the road he saw above him a bald man, grazing a herd\nof calves, and this bald man called out to him, “Fellow! can you fight\nat all?”",
        "The King’s son replied, “When I was little I could fight a bit, and\nnow, if any one wants to fight, I am not so unmanly as to turn my back.\nCome, I will fight you.”",
        "The bald man said, “If I throw you, you shall be my slave; and if you\nthrow me, I will be your slave.” So they got ready and began to fight,\nand the King’s son threw him.",
        "On this the King’s son said, “I will leave my beasts here, my simurgs,\ntigers, and dogs, and horses; they will all stay here while I go to the\ncity to see the sights. I appoint the tiger as guard over my property.\nAnd you are my slave, you, too, must stay here with my belongings.” So\nthe King’s son started off to the city to see the sights, and arrived\nat a pool.",
        "He saw that it was a pleasant pool, and thought he would stop and bathe\nthere, and therewith he began to strip off his clothes.",
        "Now the King’s daughter, who was sitting on the roof of the palace, saw\nhis royal marks, and she said, “This man is a king; when I marry, I\nwill marry him and no other.” So she said to her father, “My father; I\nwish to marry.”",
        "“Good,” said her father.",
        "Then the King made a proclamation: “Let all men, great and small,\nattend to-day in the hall of audience, for the King’s daughter will to-\nday take a husband.”",
        "All the men of the land assembled, and the traveller Prince also came,\ndressed in the Fakir’s clothes, saying to himself, “I must see this\nceremony to-day.” He went in and sat down.",
        "The King’s daughter came out and sat in the balcony, and cast her\nglance round all the assembly. She noticed that the traveller Prince\nwas sitting in the assembly in Fakir’s attire.",
        "The Princess said to her handmaiden, “Take this dish of henna, go to\nthat traveller dressed like a Fakir, and sprinkle scent on him from the\ndish.”",
        "The handmaiden obeyed the Princess’s order, went to him, and sprinkled\nthe scent over him.",
        "Then the people said, “The slave-girl has made a mistake.”",
        "But she replied, “The slave-girl has made no mistake, ’tis her mistress\nhas made the mistake.”",
        "On this the King married his daughter to the Fakir, who was really no\nFakir, but a Prince.",
        "What fate had decreed came to pass in that country, and they were\nmarried. But the King of that city became very sad in his heart,\nbecause when so many chiefs and nobles were sitting there his daughter\nhad chosen none of them, but had chosen that Fakir; but he kept these\nthoughts concealed in his heart.",
        "One day the traveller Prince said, “Let all the King’s sons-in-law come\nout with me to-day to hunt.”",
        "People said, “What is this Fakir that he should go a-hunting?”",
        "However, they all set out for the hunt, and fixed their meeting-place\nat a certain pool.",
        "The newly married Prince went to his tigers, and told his tigers and\nhounds to kill and bring in a great number of gazelles and hog-deer and\nmarkhor. Instantly they killed and brought in a great number. Then\ntaking with him these spoils of the chase, the Prince came to the pool\nsettled on as a meeting-place. The other Princes, sons-in-law of the\nKing of that city, also assembled there; but they had brought in no\ngame, and the new Prince had brought a great deal. Thence they returned\nhome to the town, and went to the King their father-in-law, to present\ntheir game.",
        "Now that King had no son. Then the new Prince told him that in fact he,\ntoo, was a Prince. At this the King, his father-in-law, was greatly\ndelighted and took him by the hand and embraced him. He seated him by\nhimself, saying, “O Prince, I return thanks that you have come here and\nbecome my son-in-law; I am very happy at this, and I make over my\nkingdom to you.”",
        "As a certain fisherwoman passed by a palace crying her fish, the queen\nappeared at one of the windows and beckoned her to come near and show\nwhat she had. At that moment a very big fish jumped about in the bottom\nof the basket.",
        "“Is it a he or a she?” inquired the queen. “I wish to purchase a she\nfish.”",
        "On hearing this the fish laughed aloud.",
        "“It’s a he,” replied the fisherwoman, and proceeded on her rounds.",
        "The queen returned to her room in a great rage; and on coming to see\nher in the evening, the king noticed that something had disturbed her.",
        "“Are you indisposed?” he said.",
        "“No; but I am very much annoyed at the strange behaviour of a fish. A\nwoman brought me one to-day, and on my inquiring whether it was a male\nor female, the fish laughed most rudely.”",
        "“A fish laugh! Impossible! You must be dreaming.”",
        "“I am not a fool. I speak of what I have seen with my own eyes and have\nheard with my own ears.”",
        "“Passing strange! Be it so. I will inquire concerning it.”",
        "On the morrow the king repeated to his vizier what his wife had told\nhim, and bade him investigate the matter, and be ready with a\nsatisfactory answer within six months, on pain of death. The vizier\npromised to do his best, though he felt almost certain of failure. For\nfive months he laboured indefatigably to find a reason for the laughter\nof the fish. He sought everywhere and from every one. The wise and\nlearned, and they who were skilled in magic and in all manner of\ntrickery, were consulted. Nobody, however, could explain the matter;\nand so he returned broken-hearted to his house, and began to arrange\nhis affairs in prospect of certain death, for he had had sufficient\nexperience of the king to know that His Majesty would not go back from\nhis threat. Amongst other things, he advised his son to travel for a\ntime, until the king’s anger should have somewhat cooled.",
        "The young fellow, who was both clever and handsome, started off\nwhithersoever Kismat might lead him. He had been gone some days, when\nhe fell in with an old farmer, who also was on a journey to a certain\nvillage. Finding the old man very pleasant, he asked him if he might\naccompany him, professing to be on a visit to the same place. The old\nfarmer agreed, and they walked along together. The day was hot, and the\nway was long and weary.",
        "“Don’t you think it would be pleasanter if you and I sometimes gave one\nanother a lift?” said the youth.",
        "“What a fool the man is!” thought the old farmer.",
        "Presently they passed through a field of corn ready for the sickle, and\nlooking like a sea of gold as it waved to and fro in the breeze.",
        "“Is this eaten or not?” said the young man.",
        "Not understanding his meaning, the old man replied, “I don’t know.”",
        "After a little while the two travellers arrived at a big village, where\nthe young man gave his companion a clasp-knife, and said, “Take this,\nfriend, and get two horses with it; but mind and bring it back, for it\nis very precious.”",
        "The old man, looking half amused and half angry, pushed back the knife,\nmuttering something to the effect that his friend was either a fool\nhimself or else trying to play the fool with him. The young man\npretended not to notice his reply, and remained almost silent till they\nreached the city, a short distance outside which was the old farmer’s\nhouse. They walked about the bazar and went to the mosque, but nobody\nsaluted them or invited them to come in and rest.",
        "“What a large cemetery!” exclaimed the young man.",
        "“What does the man mean,” thought the old farmer, “calling this largely\npopulated city a cemetery?”",
        "On leaving the city their way led through a cemetery where a few people\nwere praying beside a grave and distributing chapatis and kulchas to\npassers-by, in the name of their beloved dead. They beckoned to the two\ntravellers and gave them as much as they would.",
        "“What a splendid city this is!” said the young man.",
        "“Now, the man must surely be demented!” thought the old farmer. “I\nwonder what he will do next? He will be calling the land water, and the\nwater land; and be speaking of light where there is darkness, and of\ndarkness when it is light.” However, he kept his thoughts to himself.",
        "Presently they had to wade through a stream that ran along the edge of\nthe cemetery. The water was rather deep, so the old farmer took of his\nshoes and paijamas and crossed over; but the young man waded through it\nwith his shoes and paijamas on.",
        "“Well! I never did see such a perfect fool, both in word and in deed,\"\nsaid the old man to himself.",
        "However, he liked the fellow; and thinking that he would amuse his wife\nand daughter, he invited him to come and stay at his house as long as\nhe had occasion to remain in the village.",
        "“Thank you very much,” the young man replied; “but let me first\ninquire, if you please, whether the beam of your house is strong.”",
        "The old farmer left him in despair, and entered his house laughing.",
        "“There is a man in yonder field,” he said, after returning their\ngreetings. “He has come the greater part of the way with me, and I\nwanted him to put up here as long as he had to stay in this village.\nBut the fellow is such a fool that I cannot make anything out of him.\nHe wants to know if the beam of this house is all right. The man must\nbe mad!” and saying this, he burst into a fit of laughter.",
        "“Father,” said the farmer’s daughter, who was a very sharp and wise\ngirl, “this man, whosoever he is, is no fool, as you deem him. He only\nwishes to know if you can afford to entertain him.”",
        "“Oh! of course,” replied the farmer. “I see. Well perhaps you can help\nme to solve some of his other mysteries. While we were walking together\nhe asked whether he should carry me or I should carry him, as he\nthought that would be a pleasanter mode of proceeding.”",
        "“Most assuredly,” said the girl. “He meant that one of you should tell\na story to beguile the time.”",
        "“Oh yes. Well, we were passing through a corn-field, when he asked me\nwhether it was eaten or not.”",
        "“And didn’t you know the meaning of this, father? He simply wished to\nknow if the man was in debt or not; because, if the owner of the field\nwas in debt, then the produce of the field was as good as eaten to him;\nthat is, it would have to go to his creditors.”",
        "“Yes, yes, yes; of course! Then, on entering a certain village, he bade\nme take his clasp knife and get two horses with it, and bring back the\nknife again to him.”",
        "“Are not two stout sticks as good as two horses for helping one along\non the road? He only asked you to cut a couple of sticks and be careful\nnot to lose his knife.”",
        "“I see,” said the farmer. “While we were walking over the city we did\nnot see anybody that we knew, and not a soul gave us a scrap of\nanything to eat, till we were passing the cemetery; but there some\npeople called to us and put into our hands some chapatis and kulchas;\nso my companion called the city a cemetery, and the cemetery a city.”",
        "“This also is to be understood, father, if one thinks of the city as\nthe place where everything is to be obtained, and of inhospitable\npeople as worse than the dead. The city, though crowded with people,\nwas as if dead, as far as you were concerned; while, in the cemetery,\nwhich is crowded with the dead, you were saluted by kind friends and\nprovided with bread.”",
        "“True, true!” said the astonished farmer. “Then, just now, when we were\ncrossing the stream, he waded through it without taking off his shoes\nand paijamas.”",
        "“I admire his wisdom,” replied the girl. “I have often thought how\nstupid people were to venture into that swiftly flowing stream and over\nthose sharp stones with bare feet. The slightest stumble and they would\nfall, and be wetted from head to foot. This friend of yours is a most\nwise man. I should like to see him and speak to him.”",
        "“Very well,” said the farmer; “I will go and find him, and bring him\nin.”",
        "“Tell him, father, that our beams are strong enough, and then he will\ncome in. I’ll send on ahead a present to the man, to show him that we\ncan afford to have him for our guest.”",
        "Accordingly she called a servant and sent him to the young man with a\npresent of a basin of ghee, twelve chapatis, and a jar of milk, and the\nfollowing message:–\"O friend, the moon is full; twelve months make a\nyear, and the sea is overflowing with water.”",
        "Half-way the bearer of this present and message met his little son,\nwho, seeing what was in the basket, begged his father to give him some\nof the food. His father foolishly complied. Presently he saw the young\nman, and gave him the rest of the present and the message.",
        "“Give your mistress my salam,” he replied, “and tell her that the moon\nis new, and that I can only find eleven months in the year, and the sea\nis by no means full.”",
        "Not understanding the meaning of these words, the servant repeated them\nword for word, as he had heard them, to his mistress; and thus his\ntheft was discovered, and he was severely punished. After a little\nwhile the young man appeared with the old farmer. Great attention was\nshown to him, and he was treated in every way as if he were the son of\na great man, although his humble host knew nothing of his origin. At\nlength he told them everything–about the laughing of the fish, his\nfather’s threatened execution, and his own banishment–and asked their\nadvice as to what he should do.",
        "“The laughing of the fish,” said the girl, “which seems to have been\nthe cause of all this trouble, indicates that there is a man in the\npalace who is plotting against the king’s life.”",
        "“Joy, joy!” exclaimed the vizier’s son. “There is yet time for me to\nreturn and save my father from an ignominious and unjust death, and the\nking from danger.”",
        "The following day he hastened back to his own country, taking with him\nthe farmer’s daughter. Immediately on arrival he ran to the palace and\ninformed his father of what he had heard. The poor vizier, now almost\ndead from the expectation of death, was at once carried to the king, to\nwhom he repeated the news that his son had just brought.",
        "“Never!” said the king.",
        "“But it must be so, Your Majesty,” replied the vizier; “and in order to\nprove the truth of what I have heard, I pray you to call together all\nthe maids in your palace, and order them to jump over a pit, which must\nbe dug. We’ll soon find out whether there is any man there.”",
        "The king had the pit dug, and commanded all the maids belonging to the\npalace to try to jump it. All of them tried, but only one succeeded.\nThat one was found to be a man!!",
        "Thus was the queen satisfied, and the faithful old vizier saved.",
        "Afterwards, as soon as could be, the vizier’s son married the old\nfarmer’s daughter; and a most happy marriage it was.",
        "This story the Teacher told in Jetavana about a Brother who had\nceased striving after righteousness. Said the Teacher to him: “Is it\nreally true that you have ceased all striving?\"–\"Yes, Blessed One,” he\nreplied. Then the Teacher said: “O Brother, in former days wise men\nmade effort in the place where effort should be made, and so attained\nunto royal power.” And he told a story of long ago.",
        "Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was King of Benares, the Bodhisatta\nwas born as son of his chief queen.

The Brahmans who had skill in divining from such marks beheld\nthe excellence of his, and made answer:",

        "When he reached mid-forest the Demon showed himself. He made himself as\ntall as a palm tree; his head was the size of a pagoda, his eyes as big\nas saucers, and he had two tusks all over knobs and bulbs; he had the\nface of a hawk, a variegated belly, and blue hands and feet.",
        "“Where are you going?” he shouted. “Stop! You’ll make a meal for me!”",
        "Said the Bodhisatta: “Demon, I came here trusting in myself. I advise\nyou to be careful how you come near me. Here’s a poisoned arrow, which\nI’ll shoot at you and knock you down!” With this menace, he fitted to\nhis bow an arrow dipped in deadly poison, and let fly. The arrow stuck\nfast in the Demon’s hair. Then he shot and shot, till he had shot away\nfifty arrows; and they all stuck in the Demon’s hair. The Demon snapped\nthem all off short, and threw them down at his feet; then came up to\nthe Bodhisatta, who drew his sword and struck the Demon, threatening\nhim the while. His sword–it was three-and-thirty inches long–stuck in\nthe Demon’s hair! The Bodhisatta struck him with his spear–that stuck\ntoo! He struck him with his club–and that stuck too!",
        "When the Bodhisatta saw that this had stuck fast, he addressed the\nDemon. “You, Demon!” said he, “did you never hear of me before–the\nPrince of the Five Weapons? When I came into the forest which you live\nin I did not trust to my bow and other weapons. This day will I pound\nyou and grind you to powder!” Thus did he declare his resolve, and with\na shout he hit at the Demon with his right hand. It stuck fast in his\nhair! He hit him with his left hand–that stuck too! With his right\nfoot he kicked him–that stuck too; then with his left–and that stuck\ntoo! Then he butted at him with his head, crying, “I’ll pound you to\npowder!” and his head stuck fast like the rest.",
        "Thus the Bodhisatta was five times snared, caught fast in five places,\nhanging suspended: yet he felt no fear–was not even nervous.",
        "Thought the Demon to himself: “Here’s a lion of a man! A noble man!\nMore than man is he! Here he is, caught by a Demon like me; yet he will\nnot fear a bit. Since I have ravaged this road, I never saw such a man.\nNow, why is it that he does not fear?” He was powerless to eat the man,\nbut asked him: “Why is it, young sir, that you are not frightened to\ndeath?”",
        "“Why should I fear, Demon?” replied he. “In one life a man can die but\nonce. Besides, in my belly is a thunderbolt; if you eat me, you will\nnever be able to digest it; this will tear your inwards into little\nbits, and kill you: so we shall both perish. That is why I fear\nnothing.” (By this, the Bodhisatta meant the weapon of knowledge which\nhe had within him.)",
        "When he heard this, the Demon thought: “This young man speaks the\ntruth. A piece of the flesh of such a lion-man as he would be too much\nfor me to digest, if it were no bigger than a kidney-bean. I’ll let him\ngo!” So, being frightened to death, he let go the Bodhisatta, saying\n\"Young sir, you are a lion of a man! I will not eat you up. I set you\nfree from my hands, as the moon is disgorged from the jaws of Rahu\nafter the eclipse. Go back to the company of your friends and\nrelations!”",
        "And the Bodhisatta said: “Demon, I will go, as you say. You were born a\nDemon, cruel, blood-bibbing, devourer of the flesh and gore of others,\nbecause you did wickedly in former lives. If you still go on doing\nwickedly, you will go from darkness to darkness. But now that you have\nseen me you will find it impossible to do wickedly. Taking the life of\nliving creatures causes birth, as an animal, in the world of Petas, or\nin the body of an Asura, or, if one is reborn as a man, it makes his\nlife short.” With this and the like monition he told him the\ndisadvantage of the five kinds of wickedness, and the profit of the\nfive kinds of virtue, and frightened the Demon in various ways,\ndiscoursing to him until he subdued him and made him self-denying, and\nestablished him in the five kinds of virtue; he made him worship the\ndeity to whom offerings were made in that wood; and having carefully\nadmonished him, departed out of it.",
        "At the entrance of the forest he told all to the people thereabout; and\nwent on to Benares, armed with his five weapons. Afterwards he became\nking, and ruled righteously; and after giving alms and doing good he\npassed away according to his deeds.",
        "And the Teacher, when this tale was ended, became perfectly\nenlightened, and repeated this verse:",
        "  Whose mind and heart from all desire is free,\n  Who seeks for peace by living virtuously,\n    He in due time will sever all the bonds\n  That bind him fast to life, and cease to be.",
        "Thus the Teacher reached the summit, through sainthood and the teaching\nof the law, and thereupon he declared the Four Truths. At the end of\nthe declaring of the Truths, this Brother also attained to sainthood.\nThen the Teacher made the connexion, and gave the key to the birth-\ntale, saying: “At that time Angulimala was the Demon, but the Prance of\nthe Five Weapons was I myself.”",
        "One day a young prince was out practising archery with the son of his\nfather’s chief vizier, when one of the arrows accidentally struck the\nwife of a merchant, who was walking about in an upper room of a house\nclose by. The prince aimed at a bird that was perched on the window-\nsill of that room, and had not the slightest idea that anybody was at\nhand, or he would not have shot in that direction. Consequently, not\nknowing what had happened, he and the vizier’s son walked away, the\nvizier’s son chaffing him because he had missed the bird.",
        "Presently the merchant went to ask his wife about something, and found\nher lying, to all appearance, dead in the middle of the room, and an\narrow fixed in the ground within half a yard of her head. Supposing\nthat she was dead, he rushed to the window and shrieked, “Thieves\nthieves! They have killed my wife.” The neighbours quickly gathered,\nand the servants came running upstairs to see what was the matter. It\nhappened that the woman had fainted, and that there was only a very\nslight wound in her breast where the arrow had grazed.",
        "As soon as the woman recovered her senses she told them that two young\nmen had passed by the place with their bows and arrows, and that one of\nthem had most deliberately aimed at her as she stood by the window.",
        "On hearing this the merchant went to the king, and told him what had\ntaken place. His Majesty was much enraged at such audacious wickedness,\nand swore that most terrible punishment should be visited on the\noffender if he could be discovered. He ordered the merchant to go back\nand ascertain whether his wife could recognise the young men if she saw\nthem again.",
        "“Oh yes,” replied the woman, “I should know them again among all the\npeople in the city.”",
        "“Then,” said the king, when the merchant brought back this reply, “to-\nmorrow I will cause all the male inhabitants of this city to pass\nbefore your house, and your wife will stand at the window and watch for\nthe man who did this wanton deed.”",
        "A royal proclamation was issued to this effect. So the next day all the\nmen and boys of the city, from the age of ten years upwards, assembled\nand marched by the house of the merchant. By chance (for they both had\nbeen excused from obeying this order) the king’s son and the vizier’s\nson were also in the company, and passed by in the crowd. They came to\nsee the tamasha.",
        "As soon as these two appeared in front of the merchant’s window they\nwere recognised by the merchant’s wife, and at once reported to the\nking.",
        "“My own son and the son of my chief vizier!” exclaimed the king, who\nhad been present from the commencement. “What examples for the people!\nLet them both be executed.”",
        "“Not so, your Majesty,” said the vizier, “I beseech you Let the facts\nof the case be thoroughly investigated. How is it?” he continued,\nturning to the two young men. “Why have you done this cruel thing?”",
        "“I shot an arrow at a bird that was sitting on the sill of an open\nwindow in yonder house, and missed,” answered the prince. “I suppose\nthe arrow struck the merchant’s wife. Had I known that she or anybody\nhad been near I should not have shot in that direction.”",
        "“We will speak of this later on,” said the king, on hearing this\nanswer. “Dismiss the people. Their presence is no longer needed.”",
        "In the evening his Majesty and the vizier had a long and earnest talk\nabout their two sons. The king wished both of them to be executed; but\nthe vizier suggested that the prince should be banished from the\ncountry. This was finally agreed to.",
        "Accordingly, on the following morning, a little company of soldiers\nescorted the prince out of the city. When they reached the last custom-\nhouse the vizier’s son overtook them. He had come with all haste,\nbringing with him four bags of muhrs on four horses. “I am come,” he\nsaid, throwing his arms round the prince’s neck, “because I cannot let\nyou go alone. We have lived together, we will be exiled together, and\nwe will die together. Turn me not back, if you love me.”",
        "“Consider,” the prince answered, “what you are doing. All kinds of\ntrial may be before me. Why should you leave your home and country to\nbe with me?”",
        "“Because I love you,” he said, “and shall never be happy without you.”",
        "So the two friends walked along hand in hand as fast as they could to\nget out of the country, and behind them marched the soldiers and the\nhorses with their valuable burdens. On reaching a place on the borders\nof the king’s dominions the prince gave the soldiers some gold, and\nordered them to return. The soldiers took the money and left; they did\nnot, however, go very far, but hid themselves behind rocks and stones,\nand waited till they were quite sure that the prince did not intend to\ncome back.",
        "On and on the exiles walked, till they arrived at a certain village,\nwhere they determined to spend the night under one of the big trees of\nthe place. The prince made preparations for a fire, and arranged the\nfew articles of bedding that they had with them, while the vizier’s son\nwent to the baniya and the baker and the butcher to get something for\ntheir dinner. For some reason he was delayed; perhaps the tsut was not\nquite ready, or the baniya had not got all the spices prepared. After\nwaiting half an hour the prince became impatient, and rose up and\nwalked about.",
        "He saw a pretty, clear little brook running along not far from their\nresting-place, and hearing that its source was not far distant, he\nstarted off to find it. The source was a beautiful lake, which at that\ntime was covered with the magnificent lotus flower and other water\nplants. The prince sat down on the bank, and being thirsty took up some\nof the water in his hand. Fortunately he looked into his hand before\ndrinking, and there, to his great astonishment, he saw reflected whole\nand clear the image of a beautiful fairy. He looked round, hoping to\nsee the reality; but seeing no person, he drank the water, and put out\nhis hand to take some more. Again he saw the reflection in the water\nwhich was in his palm. He looked around as before, and this time\ndiscovered a fairy sitting by the bank on the opposite side of the\nlake. On seeing her he fell so madly in love with her that he dropped\ndown in a swoon.",
        "When the vizier’s son returned, and found the fire lighted, the horses\nsecurely fastened, and the bags of muhrs lying altogether in a heap,\nbut no prince, he did not know what to think. He waited a little while,\nand then shouted; but not getting any reply, he got up and went to the\nbrook. There he came across the footmarks of his friend. Seeing these,\nhe went back at once for the money and the horses, and bringing them\nwith him, he tracked the prince to the lake, where he found him lying\nto all appearance dead.",
        "“Alas! alas!” he cried, and lifting up the prince, he poured some water\nover his head and face. “Alas! my brother, what is this? Oh! do not die\nand leave me thus. Speak, speak! I cannot bear this!”",
        "In a few minutes the prince, revived by the water, opened his eyes, and\nlooked about wildly.",
        "“Thank God!” exclaimed the vizier’s son. “But what is the matter,\nbrother?”",
        "“Go away,” replied the prince. “I don’t want to say anything to you, or\nto see you. Go away.”",
        "“Come, come; let us leave this place. Look, I have brought some food\nfor you, and horses, and everything. Let us eat and depart.”",
        "“Go alone,” replied the prince.",
        "“Never,” said the vizier’s son. “What has happened to suddenly estrange\nyou from me? A little while ago we were brethren, but now you detest\nthe sight of me.”",
        "“I have looked upon a fairy,” the prince said. “But a moment I saw her\nface; for when she noticed that I was looking at her she covered her\nface with lotus petals. Oh, how beautiful she was! And while I gazed\nshe took out of her bosom an ivory box, and held it up to me. Then I\nfainted. Oh! if you can get me that fairy for my wife, I will go\nanywhere with you.”",
        "“Oh, brother,” said the vizier’s son, “you have indeed seen a fairy.\nShe is a fairy of the fairies. This is none other than Gulizar of the\nIvory City. I know this from the signs that she gave you. From her\ncovering her face with lotus petals I learn her name, and from her\nshowing you the ivory box I learn where she lives. Be patient, and rest\nassured that I will arrange your marriage with her.”",
        "When the prince heard these encouraging words he felt much comforted,\nrose up, and ate, and then went away gladly with his friend.",
        "On the way they met two men. These two men belonged to a family of\nrobbers. There were eleven of them altogether. One, an elder sister,\nstayed at home and cooked the food, and the other ten–all brothers–\nwent out, two and two, and walked about the four different ways that\nran through that part of the country, robbing those travellers who\ncould not resist them, and inviting others, who were too powerful for\ntwo of them to manage, to come and rest at their house, where the whole\nfamily attacked them and stole their goods. These thieves lived in a\nkind of tower, which had several strong-rooms in it, and under it was a\ngreat pit, wherein they threw the corpses of the poor unfortunates who\nchanced to fall into their power.",
        "The two men came forward, and, politely accosting them, begged them to\ncome and stay at their house for the night. “It is late,” they said,\n\"and there is not another village within several miles.”",
        "“Shall we accept this good man’s invitation, brother?” asked the\nprince.",
        "The vizier’s son frowned slightly in token of disapproval; but the\nprince was tired, and thinking that it was only a whim of his friend’s,\nhe said to the men, “Very well. It is very kind of you to ask us.”",
        "So they all four went to the robbers’ tower.",
        "Seated in a room, with the door fastened on the outside, the two\ntravellers bemoaned their fate.",
        "“It is no good groaning,” said the vizier’s son. “I will climb to the\nwindow, and see whether there are any means of escape. Yes! yes!” he\nwhispered, when he had reached the window-hole. “Below there is a ditch\nsurrounded by a high wall. I will jump down and reconnoitre. You stay\nhere, and wait till I return.”",
        "Presently he came back and told the prince that he had seen a most ugly\nwoman, whom he supposed was the robbers’ housekeeper. She had agreed to\nrelease them on the promise of her marriage with the prince.",
        "So the woman led the way out of the enclosure by a secret door.",
        "“But where are the horses and the goods?” the vizier’s son inquired.",
        "“You cannot bring them,” the woman said. “To go out by any other way\nwould be to thrust oneself into the grave.”",
        "“All right, then; they also shall go out by this door. I have a charm,\nwhereby I can make them thin or fat.” So the vizier’s son fetched the\nhorses without any person knowing it, and repeating the charm, he made\nthem pass through the narrow doorway like pieces of cloth, and when\nthey were all outside restored them to their former condition. He at\nonce mounted his horse and laid hold of the halter of one of the other\nhorses, and then beckoning to the prince to do likewise, he rode off.\nThe prince saw his opportunity, and in a moment was riding after him,\nhaving the woman behind him.",
        "Now the robbers heard the galloping of the horses, and ran out and shot\ntheir arrows at the prince and his companions. And one of the arrows\nkilled the woman, so they had to leave her behind.",
        "On, on they rode, until they reached a village where they stayed the\nnight. The following morning they were off again, and asked for Ivory\nCity from every passer-by. At length they came to this famous city, and\nput up at a little hut that belonged to an old woman, from whom they\nfeared no harm, and with whom, therefore, they could abide in peace and\ncomfort. At first the old woman did not like the idea of these\ntravellers staying in her house, but the sight of a muhr, which the\nprince dropped in the bottom of a cup in which she had given him water,\nand a present of another muhr from the vizier’s son, quickly made her\nchange her mind. She agreed to let them stay there for a few days.",
        "As soon as her work was over the old woman came and sat down with her\nlodgers. The vizier’s son pretended to be utterly ignorant of the place\nand people. “Has this city a name?” he asked the old woman.",
        "“Of course it has, you stupid. Every little village, much more a city,\nand such a city as this, has a name.”",
        "“What is the name of this city?”",
        "“Ivory City. Don’t you know that? I thought the name was known all over\nthe world.”",
        "On the mention of the name Ivory City the prince gave a deep sigh. The\nvizier’s son looked as much as to say “Keep quiet, or you’ll discover\nthe secret.”",
        "“Is there a king of this country?” continued the vizier’s son.",
        "“Of course there is, and a queen, and a princess.”",
        "“What are their names?”",
        "“The name of the princess is Gulizar, and the name of the queen––”",
        "The vizier’s son interrupted the old woman by turning to look at the\nprince, who was staring like a madman. “Yes,” he said to him\nafterwards, “we are in the right country. We shall see the beautiful\nprincess.”",
        "One morning the two travellers noticed the old woman’s most careful\ntoilette: how careful she was in the arrangement of her hair and the\nset of her kasabah and puts.",
        "“Who is coming?” said the vizier’s son.",
        "“Nobody,” the old woman replied.",
        "“Then where are you going?”",
        "“I am going to see my daughter, who is a servant of the Princess\nGulizar. I see her and the princess every day. I should have gone\nyesterday, if you had not been here and taken up all my time.”",
        "“Ah-h-h! Be careful not to say anything about us in the hearing of the\nprincess.” The vizier’s son asked her not to speak about them at the\npalace, hoping that, because she had been told not to do so, she would\nmention their arrival, and thus the princess would be informed of their\ncoming.",
        "On seeing her mother the girl pretended to be very angry. “Why have you\nnot been for two days?” she asked.",
        "“Because, my dear,” the old woman answered, “two young travellers, a\nprince and the son of some great vizier, have taken up their abode in\nmy hut, and demand so much of my attention. It is nothing but cooking\nand cleaning, and cleaning and cooking, all day long. I can’t\nunderstand the men,” she added; “one of them especially appears very\nstupid. He asked me the name of this country and the name of the\nking. Now where can these men have come from, that they do not know\nthese things? However, they are very great and very rich. They each\ngive me a muhr every morning and every evening.”",
        "After this the old woman went and repeated almost the same words to the\nprincess, on the hearing of which the princess beat her severely; and\nthreatened her with a severer punishment if she ever again spoke of the\nstrangers before her.",
        "In the evening, when the old woman had returned to her hut, she told\nthe vizier’s son how sorry she was that she could not help breaking her\npromise, and how the princess had struck her because she mentioned\ntheir coming and all about them.",
        "“Alas! alas!” said the prince, who had eagerly listened to every word.\n\"What, then, will be her anger at the sight of a man?”",
        "“Anger?” said the vizier’s son, with an astonished air. “She would be\nexceedingly glad to see one man. I know this. In this treatment of the\nold woman I see her request that you will go and see her during the\ncoming dark fortnight.”",
        "“Heaven be praised!” the prince exclaimed.",
        "The next time the old woman went to the palace Gulizar called one of\nher servants and ordered her to rush into the room while she was\nconversing with the old woman; and if the old woman asked what was the\nmatter, she was to say that the king’s elephants had gone mad, and were\nrushing about the city and bazaar in every direction, and destroying\neverything in their way.",
        "The servant obeyed, and the old woman, fearing lest the elephants\nshould go and push down her hut and kill the prince and his friend,\nbegged the princess to let her depart. Now Gulizar had obtained a\ncharmed swing, that landed whoever sat on it at the place wherever they\nwished to be. “Get the swing,” she said to one of the servants standing\nby. When it was brought she bade the old woman step into it and desire\nto be at home.",
        "The old woman did so, and was at once carried through the air quickly\nand safely to her hut, where she found her two lodgers safe and sound.\n\"Oh!” she cried, “I thought that both of you would be killed by this\ntime. The royal elephants have got loose and are running about wildly.\nWhen I heard this I was anxious about you. So the princess gave me this\ncharmed swing to return in. But come, let us get outside before the\nelephants arrive and batter down the place.”",
        "“Don’t believe this,” said the vizier’s son. “It is a mere hoax. They\nhave been playing tricks with you.”",
        "“You will soon have your heart’s desire,” he whispered aside to the\nprince. “These things are signs.”",
        "Two days of the dark fortnight had elapsed, when the prince and the\nvizier’s son seated themselves in the swing, and wished themselves\nwithin the grounds of the palace. In a moment they were there, and\nthere too was the object of their search standing by one of the palace\ngates, and longing to see the prince quite as much as he was longing to\nsee her.",
        "Oh, what a happy meeting it was!",
        "“At last,” said Gulizar, “I have seen my beloved, my husband.”",
        "“A thousand thanks to Heaven for bringing me to you,” said the prince.",
        "Then the prince and Gulizar betrothed themselves to one another and\nparted, the one for the hut and the other for the palace, both of them\nfeeling happier than they had ever been before.",
        "Henceforth the prince visited Gulizar every day and returned to the hut\nevery night. One morning Gulizar begged him to stay with her always.\nShe was constantly afraid of some evil happening to him–perhaps\nrobbers would slay him, or sickness attack him, and then she would be\ndeprived of him. She could not live without seeing him. The prince\nshowed her that there was no real cause for fear, and said that he felt\nhe ought to return to his friend at night, because he had left his home\nand country and risked his life for him; and, moreover, if it had not\nbeen for his friend’s help he would never have met with her.",
        "Gulizar for the time assented, but she determined in her heart to get\nrid of the vizier’s son as soon as possible. A few days after this\nconversation she ordered one of her maids to make a pilaw. She gave\nspecial directions that a certain poison was to be mixed into it while\ncooking, and as soon as it was ready the cover was to be placed on the\nsaucepan, so that the poisonous steam might not escape. When the pilaw\nwas ready she sent it at once by the hand of a servant to the vizier’s\nson with this message “Gulizar, the princess, sends you an offering in\nthe name of her dead uncle.”",
        "On receiving the present the vizier’s son thought that the prince had\nspoken gratefully of him to the princess, and therefore she had thus\nremembered him. Accordingly he sent back his salam and expressions of\nthankfulness.",
        "When it was dinner-time he took the saucepan of pilaw and went out to\neat it by the stream. Taking off the lid, he threw it aside on the\ngrass and then washed his hands. During the minute or so that he was\nperforming these ablutions, the green grass under the cover of the\nsaucepan turned quite yellow. He was astonished, and suspecting that\nthere was poison in the pilaw, he took a little and threw it to some\ncrows that were hopping about. The moment the crows ate what was thrown\nto them they fell down dead.",
        "“Heaven be praised,” exclaimed the vizier’s son, “who has preserved me\nfrom death at this time!”",
        "On the return of the prince that evening the vizier’s son was very\nreticent and depressed. The prince noticed this change in him, and\nasked what was the reason. “Is it because I am away so much at the\npalace?” The vizier’s son saw that the prince had nothing to do with\nthe sending of the pilaw, and therefore told him everything.",
        "“Look here,” he said, “in this handkerchief is some pilaw that the\nprincess sent me this morning in the name of her deceased uncle. It is\nsaturated with poison. Thank Heaven, I discovered it in time!”",
        "“Oh, brother! who could have done this thing? Who is there that\nentertains enmity against you?”",
        "“The Princess Gulizar. Listen. The next time you go to see her, I\nentreat you to take some snow with you; and just before seeing the\nprincess put a little of it into both your eyes. It will provoke tears,\nand Gulizar will ask you why you are crying. Tell her that you weep for\nthe loss of your friend, who died suddenly this morning. Look! take,\ntoo, this wine and this shovel, and when you have feigned intense grief\nat the death of your friend, bid the princess to drink a little of the\nwine. It is strong, and will immediately send her into a deep sleep.\nThen, while she is asleep, heat the shovel and mark her back with it.\nRemember to bring back the shovel again, and also to take her pearl\nnecklace. This done, return. Now fear not to execute these\ninstructions, because on the fulfilment of them depends your fortune\nand happiness. I will arrange that your marriage with the princess\nshall be accepted by the king, her father, and all the court.”",
        "The prince promised that he would do everything as the vizier’s son had\nadvised him; and he kept his promise.",
        "The following night, on the return of the prince from his visit to\nGulizar, he and the vizier’s son, taking the horses and bags of muhrs,\nwent to a graveyard about a mile or so distant. It was arranged that\nthe vizier’s son should act the part of a fakir and the prince the part\nof the fakir’s disciple and servant.",
        "In the morning, when Gulizar had returned to her senses, she felt a\nsmarting pain in her back, and noticed that her pearl necklace was\ngone. She went at once and informed the king of the loss of her\nnecklace, but said nothing to him about the pain in her back.",
        "The king was very angry when he heard of the theft, and caused\nproclamation concerning it to be made throughout all the city and\nsurrounding country.",
        "“It is well,” said the vizier’s son, when he heard of this\nproclamation. “Fear not, my brother, but go and take this necklace, and\ntry to sell it in the bazaar.”",
        "The prince took it to a goldsmith and asked him to buy it.",
        "“How much do you want for it?” asked the man.",
        "“Fifty thousand rupees,” the prince replied.",
        "“All right,” said the man; “wait here while I go and fetch the money.”",
        "The prince waited and waited, till at last the goldsmith returned, and\nwith him the kotwal, who at once took the prince into custody on the\ncharge of stealing the princess’s necklace.",
        "“How did you get the necklace?” the kotwal asked.",
        "“A fakir, whose servant I am, gave it to me to sell in the bazaar,” the\nprince replied. “Permit me, and I will show you where he is.”",
        "The prince directed the kotwal and the policeman to the place where he\nhad left the vizier’s son, and there they found the fakir with his eyes\nshut and engaged in prayer. Presently, when he had finished his\ndevotions, the kotwal asked him to explain how he had obtained\npossession of the princess’s necklace.",
        "“Call the king hither,” he replied, “and then I will tell his Majesty\nface to face.”",
        "On this some men went to the king and told him what the fakir had said.\nHis Majesty came, and seeing the fakir so solemn and earnest in his\ndevotions, he was afraid to rouse his anger, lest peradventure the\ndispleasure of Heaven should descend on him, and so he placed his hands\ntogether in the attitude of a supplicant, and asked, “How did you get\nmy daughter’s necklace?”",
        "“Last night,” replied the fakir, “we were sitting here by this tomb\nworshipping Khuda, when a ghoul, dressed as a princess, came and\nexhumed a body that had been buried a few days ago, and began to eat\nit. On seeing this I was filled with anger, and beat her back with a\nshovel, which lay on the fire at the time. While running away from me\nher necklace got loose and dropped. You wonder at these words, but they\nare not difficult to prove. Examine your daughter, and you will find\nthe marks of the burn on her back. Go, and if it is as I say, send the\nprincess to me, and I will punish her.”",
        "The king went back to the palace, and at once ordered the princess’s\nback to be examined.",
        "“It is so,” said the maid-servant; “the burn is there.”",
        "“Then let the girl be slain immediately,” the king shouted.",
        "“No, no, your Majesty,” they replied. “Let us send her to the fakir who\ndiscovered this thing, that he may do whatever he wishes with her.”",
        "The king agreed, and so the princess was taken to the graveyard.",
        "“Let her be shut up in a cage, and be kept near the grave whence she\ntook out the corpse,” said the fakir.",
        "This was done, and in a little while the fakir and his disciple and the\nprincess were left alone in the graveyard. Night had not long cast its\ndark mantle over the scene when the fakir and his disciple threw off\ntheir disguise, and taking their horses and luggage, appeared before\nthe cage. They released the princess, rubbed some ointment over the\nscars on her back, and then sat her upon one of their horses behind the\nprince. Away they rode fast and far, and by the morning were able to\nrest and talk over their plans in safety. The vizier’s son showed the\nprincess some of the poisoned pilaw that she had sent him, and asked\nwhether she had repented of her ingratitude. The princess wept, and\nacknowledged that he was her greatest helper and friend.",
        "A letter was sent to the chief vizier telling him of all that had\nhappened to the prince and the vizier’s son since they had left their\ncountry. When the vizier read the letter he went and informed the king.\nThe king caused a reply to be sent to the two exiles, in which he\nordered them not to return, but to send a letter to Gulizar’s father,\nand inform him of everything. Accordingly they did this; the prince\nwrote the letter at the vizier’s son’s dictation.",
        "On reading the letter Gulizar’s father was much enraged with his\nviziers and other officials for not discovering the presence in his\ncountry of these illustrious visitors, as he was especially anxious to\ningratiate himself in the favour of the prince and the vizier’s son. He\nordered the execution of some of the viziers on a certain date.",
        "“Come,” he wrote back to the vizier’s son, “and stay at the palace. And\nif the prince desires it, I will arrange for his marriage with Gulizar\nas soon as possible.”",
        "The prince and the vizier’s son most gladly accepted the invitation,\nand received a right noble welcome from the king. The marriage soon\ntook place, and then after a few weeks the king gave them presents of\nhorses and elephants, and jewels and rich cloths, and bade them start\nfor their own land; for he was sure that the king would now receive\nthem. The night before they left the viziers and others, whom the king\nintended to have executed as soon as his visitors had left, came and\nbesought the vizier’s son to plead for them, and promised that they\neach would give him a daughter in marriage. He agreed to do so, and\nsucceeded in obtaining their pardon.",
        "Then the prince, with his beautiful bride Gulizar, and the vizier’s\nson, attended by a troop of soldiers, and a large number of camels and\nhorses bearing very much treasure, left for their own land. In the\nmidst of the way they passed the tower of the robbers, and with the\nhelp of the soldiers they razed it to the ground, slew all its inmates,\nand seized the treasure which they had been amassing there for several\nyears.",
        "At length they reached their own country, and when the king saw his\nson’s beautiful wife and his magnificent retinue he was at once\nreconciled, and ordered him to enter the city and take up his abode\nthere.",
        "Henceforth all was sunshine on the path of the prince. He became a\ngreat favourite, and in due time succeeded to the throne, and ruled the\ncountry for many, many years in peace and happiness.",
        "One day Sun, Moon, and Wind went out to dine with their uncle and aunts\nThunder and Lightning. Their mother (one of the most distant Stars you\nsee far up in the sky) waited alone for her children’s return.",
        "Now both Sun and Wind were greedy and selfish. They enjoyed the great\nfeast that had been prepared for them, without a thought of saving any\nof it to take home to their mother–but the gentle Moon did not forget\nher. Of every dainty dish that was brought round, she placed a small\nportion under one of her beautiful long finger-nails, that Star might\nalso have a share in the treat.",
        "On their return, their mother, who had kept watch for them all night\nlong with her little bright eye, said, “Well, children, what have you\nbrought home for me?” Then Sun (who was eldest) said, “I have brought\nnothing home for you. I went out to enjoy myself with my friends–not\nto fetch a dinner for my mother!” And Wind said, “Neither have I\nbrought anything home for you, mother. You could hardly expect me to\nbring a collection of good things for you, when I merely went out for\nmy own pleasure.” But Moon said, “Mother, fetch a plate, see what I\nhave brought you.” And shaking her hands she showered down such a\nchoice dinner as never was seen before.",
        "Then Star turned to Sun and spoke thus, “Because you went out to amuse\nyourself with your friends, and feasted and enjoyed yourself, without\nany thought of your mother at home–you shall be cursed. Henceforth,\nyour rays shall ever be hot and scorching, and shall burn all that they\ntouch. And men shall hate you, and cover their heads when you appear.”",
        "(And that is why the Sun is so hot to this day.)",
        "Then she turned to Wind and said, “You also who forgot your mother in\nthe midst of your selfish pleasures–hear your doom. You shall always\nblow in the hot dry weather, and shall parch and shrivel all living\nthings. And men shall detest and avoid you from this very time.”",
        "(And that is why the Wind in the hot weather is still so disagreeable.)",
        "But to Moon she said, “Daughter, because you remembered your mother,\nand kept for her a share in your own enjoyment, from henceforth you\nshall be ever cool, and calm, and bright. No noxious glare shall\naccompany your pure rays, and men shall always call you ’blessed.\"’",
        "(And that is why the moon’s light is so soft, and cool, and beautiful\neven to this day.)",
        "A very wealthy old man, imagining that he was on the point of death,\nsent for his sons and divided his property among them. However, he did\nnot die for several years afterwards; and miserable years many of them\nwere. Besides the weariness of old age, the old fellow had to bear with\nmuch abuse and cruelty from his sons. Wretched, selfish ingrates!\nPreviously they vied with one another in trying to please their father,\nhoping thus to receive more money, but now they had received their\npatrimony, they cared not how soon he left them–nay, the sooner the\nbetter, because he was only a needless trouble and expense. And they\nlet the poor old man know what they felt.",
        "One day he met a friend and related to him all his troubles. The friend\nsympathised very much with him, and promised to think over the matter,\nand call in a little while and tell him what to do. He did so; in a\nfew days he visited the old man and put down four bags full of stones\nand gravel before him.",
        "“Look here, friend,” said he. “Your sons will get to know of my coming\nhere to-day, and will inquire about it. You must pretend that I came to\ndischarge a long-standing debt with you, and that you are several\nthousands of rupees richer than you thought you were. Keep these bags\nin your own hands, and on no account let your sons get to them as long\nas you are alive. You will soon find them change their conduct towards\nyou. Salaam. I will come again soon to see how you are getting on.”",
        "When the young men got to hear of this further increase of wealth they\nbegan to be more attentive and pleasing to their father than ever\nbefore. And thus they continued to the day of the old man’s demise,\nwhen the bags were greedily opened, and found to contain only stones\nand gravel!",
        "Once upon a time the Bodhisatta was a Pigeon, and lived in a nest-\nbasket which a rich man’s cook had hung up in the kitchen, in order to\nearn merit by it. A greedy Crow, flying near, saw all sorts of delicate\nfood lying about in the kitchen, and fell a-hungering after it. “How in\nthe world can I get some?” thought he? At last he hit upon a plan.",
        "When the Pigeon went to search for food, behind him, following,\nfollowing, came the Crow.",
        "“What do you want, Mr. Crow? You and I don’t feed alike.”",
        "“Ah, but I like you and your ways! Let me be your chum, and let us feed\ntogether.”",
        "The Pigeon agreed, and they went on in company. The Crow pretended to\nfeed along with the Pigeon, but ever and anon he would turn back, peck\nto bits some heap of cow-dung, and eat a fat worm. When he had got a\nbellyful of them, up he flies, as pert as you like:",
        "“Hullo, Mr. Pigeon, what a time you take over your meal! One ought to\ndraw the line somewhere. Let’s be going home before it is too late.\"\nAnd so they did.",
        "The cook saw that his Pigeon had brought a friend, and hung up another\nbasket for him.",
        "A few days afterwards there was a great purchase of fish which came to\nthe rich man’s kitchen. How the Crow longed for some! So there he lay,\nfrom early morn, groaning and making a great noise. Says the Pigeon to\nthe Crow:",
        "“Come, Sir Crow, and get your breakfast!\"’",
        "“Oh dear! oh dear! I have such a fit of indigestion!” says he.",
        "“Nonsense! Crows never have indigestion,” said the Pigeon. “If you eat\na lamp-wick, that stays in your stomach a little while; but anything\nelse is digested in a trice, as soon as you eat it. Now do what I tell\nyou; don’t behave in this way just for seeing a little fish.”",
        "“Why do you say that, master? I have indigestion.”",
        "“Well, be careful,” said the Pigeon, and flew away.",
        "The cook prepared all the dishes, and then stood at the kitchen door,\nwiping the sweat off his body. “Now’s my time!” thought Mr. Crow, and\nalighted on a dish containing some dainty food. Click! The cook heard\nit, and looked round. Ah! he caught the Crow, and plucked all the\nfeathers out of his head, all but one tuft; he powdered ginger and\ncummin, mixed it up with butter-milk, and rubbed it well all over the\nbird’s body.",
        "“That’s for spoiling my master’s dinner and making me throw it away!\"\nsaid he, and threw him into his basket. Oh, how it hurt!",
        "By-and-by the Pigeon came in, and saw the Crow lying there, making a\ngreat noise. He made great game of him, and repeated a verse of poetry:",
        "  “Who is this tufted crane I see\n  Lying where he’s no right to be?\n  Come out! my friend, the crow is near,\n  And he may do you harm, I fear!”",
        "To this the Crow answered with another:",
        "  “No tufted crane am I–no, no!\n  I’m nothing but a greedy crow.\n  I would not do as I was told,\n  So now I’m plucked, as you behold.”",
        "And the Pigeon rejoined with a third verse:",
        "  “You’ll come to grief again, I know–\n  It is your nature to do so;\n  If people make a dish of meat,\n  ’Tis not for little birds to eat.”",
        "Then the Pigeon flew away, saying: “I can’t live with this creature any\nlonger.” And the Crow lay there groaning till he died.",
        "The story literature of India is in a large measure the outcome of the\nmoral revolution of the peninsula connected with the name of Gautama\nBuddha. As the influence of his life and doctrines grew, a tendency\narose to connect all the popular stories of India round the great\nteacher. This could be easily effected owing to the wide spread of the\nbelief in metempsychosis. All that was told of the sages of the past\ncould be interpreted of the Buddha by representing them as pre-\nincarnations of him. Even with Fables, or beast-tales, this could be\ndone, for the Hindoos were Darwinists long before Darwin, and regarded\nbeasts as cousins of men and stages of development in the progress of\nthe soul through the ages. Thus, by identifying the Buddha with the\nheroes of all folk-tales and the chief characters in the beast-drolls,\nthe Buddhists were enabled to incorporate the whole of the story-store\nof Hindostan in their sacred books, and enlist on their side the tale-\ntelling instincts of men.",
        "In making Buddha the centre figure of the popular literature of India,\nhis followers also invented the Frame as a method of literary art. The\nidea of connecting a number of disconnected stories familiar to us from\nThe Arabian Nights, Boccaccio’s Decamerone, Chaucer’s Canterbury\nTales, or even Pickwick, is directly traceable to the plan of\nmaking Buddha the central figure of India folk-literature. Curiously\nenough, the earliest instance of this in Buddhist literature was intended\nto be a Decameron, ten tales of Buddha’s previous births, told of each\nof the ten Perfections. Asvagosha, the earlier Boccaccio, died when he\nhad completed thirty-four of the Birth-Tales. But other collections were\nmade, and at last a corpus of the JATAKAS, or Birth-Tales of the Buddha,\nwas carried over to Ceylon, possibly as early as the first introduction of\nBuddhism, 241 B.C. There they have remained till the present day, and\nhave at last been made accessible in a complete edition in the original\nPali by Prof. Fausböll.",
        "These JATAKAS, as we now have them, are enshrined in a commentary on\nthe gathas, or moral verses, written in Ceylon by one of\nBuddhaghosa’s school in the fifth century A.D. They invariably begin\nwith a “Story of the Present,” an incident in Buddha’s life which\ncalls up to him a “Story of the Past,” a folk-tale in which he had\nplayed a part during one of his former incarnations. Thus the fable of\nthe Lion and the Crane, which opens the present collection, is\nintroduced by a “Story of the Present” in the following words:–",
        "“A service have we done thee” [the opening words of the gatha or\nmoral verse]. “This the Master told while living at Jetavana concerning\nDevadatta’s treachery. Not only now, O Bhickkus, but in a former\nexistence was Devadatta ungrateful. And having said this he told a\ntale” Then follows the tale as given above, and the commentary\nconcludes: “The Master, having given the lesson, summed up the Jataka\nthus: ’At that time, the Lion was Devadatta, and the Crane was I\nmyself.’” Similarly, with each story of the past the Buddha identifies\nhimself, or is mentioned as identical with, the virtuous hero of the\nfolk-tale. These Jatakas are 550 in number, and have been reckoned to\ninclude some 2000 tales. Some of these had been translated by Mr.\nRhys-Davids (Buddhist Birth Stories, I., Trübner’s Oriental\nLibrary, 1880), Prof. Fausböll (Five Jatakas, Copenhagen), and Dr.\nR. Morris (Folk-Lore Journal, vols. ii.-v.). A few exist sculptured\non the earliest Buddhist Stupas. Thus several of the circular figure\ndesigns on the reliefs from Amaravati, now on the grand staircase of the\nBritish Museum, represent Jatakas, or previous births of the Buddha.",
        "Some of the Jatakas bear a remarkable resemblance to some of the most\nfamiliar FABLES OF AESOP. So close is the resemblance, indeed, that it\nis impossible not to surmise an historical relation between the two.\nWhat this relation is I have discussed at considerable length in the\n\"History of the Aesopic Fable,” which forms the introductory volume to\nmy edition of Caxton’s Esope (London, D. Nutt, “Bibliothèque de\nCarabas,” 1889). In this place I can only roughly summarise my results.\nI conjecture that a collection of fables existed in India before Buddha\nand independently of the Jatakas, and connected with the name of\nKasyapa, who was afterwards made by the Buddhists into the latest of\nthe twenty-seven pre-incarnations of the Buddha. This collection of the\nFables of Kasyapa was brought to Europe with a deputation from the\nCingalese King Chandra Muka Siwa (obiit 52 A.D.) to the Emperor\nClaudius about 50 A.D., and was done into Greek as the [Greek: Logoi\nLubikoi] of “Kybises.” These were utilised by Babrius (from whom the\nGreek Aesop is derived) and Avian, and so came into the European Aesop.\nI have discussed all those that are to be found in the Jatakas in the\n\"History” before mentioned, i. pp. 54-72 (see Notes i. xv. xx.). In\nthese Notes henceforth I refer to this “History” as my Aesop.",
        "There were probably other Buddhist collections of a similar nature to\nthe Jatakas with a framework. When the Hindu reaction against Buddhism\ncame, the Brahmins adapted these, with the omission of Buddha as the\ncentral figure. There is scarcely any doubt that the so-called FABLES\nOF BIDPAI were thus derived from Buddhistic sources. In its Indian form\nthis is now extant as a Panchatantra or Pentateuch, five books\nof tales connected by a Frame. This collection is of special interest\nto us in the present connection, as it has come to Europe in various\nforms and shapes. I have edited Sir Thomas North’s English version of\nan Italian adaptation of a Spanish translation of a Latin version of a\nHebrew translation of an Arabic adaptation of the Pehlevi version of\nthe Indian original (Fables of Bidpai, London, D. Nutt,\n\"Bibliothèque de Carabas,” 1888). In this I give a genealogical table\nof the various versions, from which I calculate that the tales have\nbeen translated into thirty-eight languages in 112 different versions,\ntwenty different ones in English alone. Their influence on European\nfolk-tales has been very great: it is probable that nearly one-tenth of\nthese can be traced to the Bidpai literature. (See Notes v. ix. x.\nxiii. xv.)",
        "Other collections of a similar character, arranged in a frame, and\nderived ultimately from Buddhistic sources, also reached Europe and\nformed popular reading in the Middle Ages. Among these may be mentioned\nTHE TALES OF SINDIBAD, known to Europe as The Seven Sages of\nRome: from this we get the Gellert story (cf. Celtic Fairy\nTales), though it also occurs in the Bidpai. Another popular\ncollection was that associated with the life of St. Buddha, who has\nbeen canonised as St. Josaphat: BARLAAM AND JOSAPHAT tells of his\nconversion and much else besides, including the tale of the Three\nCaskets, used by Shakespeare in the Merchant of Venice.",
        "Some of the Indian tales reached Europe at the time of the Crusades,\neither orally or in collections no longer extant. The earliest\nselection of these was the Disciplina Clericalis of Petrus\nAlphonsi, a Spanish Jew converted about 1106: his tales were to be used\nas seasoning for sermons, and strong seasoning they must have proved.\nAnother Spanish collection of considerably later date was entitled\nEl Conde Lucanor (Eng. trans. by W. York): this contains the\nfable of The Man, his Son, and their Ass, which they ride or\ncarry as the popular voice decides. But the most famous collection of\nthis kind was that known as GESTA ROMANORUM, much of which was\ncertainly derived from Oriental and ultimately Indian sources, and so\nmight more appropriately be termed Gesta Indorum.",
        "All these collections, which reached Europe in the twelfth and\nthirteenth centuries, became very popular, and were used by monks and\nfriars to enliven their sermons as EXEMPLA. Prof. Crane has given a\nfull account of this very curious phenomenon in his erudite edition of\nthe Exempla of Jacques de Vitry (Folk Lore Society, 1890). The\nIndian stories were also used by the Italian Novellieri, much of\nBoccaccio and his school being derived from this source. As these again\ngave material for the Elizabethan Drama, chiefly in W. Painter’s\nPalace of Pleasure, a collection of translated Novelle which\nI have edited (Lond., 3 vols. 1890), it is not surprising that we can at\ntimes trace portions of Shakespeare back to India. It should also be\nmentioned that one-half of La Fontaine’s Fables (Bks. vii.-xii.) are\nderived from Indian sources. (See Note on No. v.)",
        "In India itself the collection of stories in frames went on and still\ngoes on. Besides those already mentioned there are the stories of\nVikram and the Vampire (Vetala), translated among others by the\nlate Sir Richard Burton, and the seventy stories of a parrot (Suka\nSaptati.) The whole of this literature was summed up by Somnadeva,\nc. 1200 A.D. in a huge compilation entitled Katha Sarit Sagara\n(\"Ocean of the Stream of Stories”). Of this work, written in very\nflorid style, Mr. Tawney has produced a translation in two volumes in\nthe Bibliotheca Indica. Unfortunately, there is a Divorce Court\natmosphere about the whole book, and my selections from it have been\naccordingly restricted. (Notes, No. xi.)",
        "So much for a short sketch of Indian folk-tales so far as they have\nbeen reduced to writing in the native literature. [Footnote: An\nadmirable and full account of this literature was given by M. A. Barth\nin Mélusine, t. iv. No. 12, and t. v. No. 1. See also Table i.\nof Prof. Rhys-Davids’ Birth Stories.] The Jatakas are probably\nthe oldest collection of such tales in literature, and the greater part\nof the rest are demonstrably more than a thousand years old. It is\ncertain that much (perhaps one-fifth) of the popular literature of\nmodern Europe is derived from those portions of this large bulk which\ncame west with the Crusades through the medium of Arabs and Jews. In\nhis elaborate Einleitung to the Pantschatantra, the Indian\nversion of the Fables of Bidpai, Prof. Benfey contended with enormous\nerudition that the majority of folk-tale incidents were to be found in the\nBidpai literature. His introduction consisted of over 200 monographs on\nthe spread of Indian tales to Europe. He wrote in 1859, before the great\noutburst of folk-tale collection in Europe, and he had not thus adequate\nmaterials to go about in determining the extent of Indian influence on\nthe popular mind of Europe. But he made it clear that for beast-tales and\nfor drolls, the majority of those current in the mouths of occidental\npeople were derived from Eastern and mainly Indian sources. He was\nnot successful, in my opinion, in tracing the serious fairy tale to India.\nFew of the tales in the Indian literary collections could be dignified by\nthe name of fairy tales, and it was clear that if these were to be traced\nto India, an examination of the contemporary folk-tales of the peninsula\nwould have to be attempted.",
        "The collection of current Indian folk-tales has been the work of the\nlast quarter of a century, a work, even after what has been achieved,\nstill in its initial stages. The credit of having begun the process is\ndue to Miss Frere, who, while her father was Governor of the Bombay\nPresidency, took down from the lips of her ayah, Anna de Souza,\none of a Lingaet family from Goa who had been Christian for three\ngenerations, the tales she afterwards published with Mr. Murray in\n1868, under the title, “Old Deccan Days, or, Indian Fairy Legends\ncurrent in Southern India, collected from oral tradition by M. Frere,\nwith an introduction and notes by Sir Bartle Frere.” Her example\nwas followed by Miss Stokes in her Indian Fairy Tales (London,\nEllis & White, 1880), who took down her tales from two ayahs and\na Khitmatgar, all of them Bengalese–the ayahs Hindus, and\nthe man a Mohammedan. Mr. Ralston introduced the volume with some\nremarks which dealt too much with sun-myths for present-day taste.\nAnother collection from Bengal was that of Lal Behari Day, a Hindu\ngentleman, in his Folk-Tales of Bengal (London, Macmillan,\n1883). The Panjab and the Kashmir then had their turn: Mrs. Steel\ncollected, and Captain (now Major) Temple edited and annotated, their\nWideawake Stories (London, Trübner, 1884), stories capitally\ntold and admirably annotated. Captain Temple increased the value of\nthis collection by a remarkable analysis of all the incidents contained\nin the two hundred Indian folk-tales collected up to this date. It is\nnot too much to say that this analysis marks an onward step in the\nscientific study of the folk-tale: there is such a thing, derided as it\nmay be. I have throughout the Notes been able to draw attention to\nIndian parallels by a simple reference to Major Temple’s Analysis.",
        "Major Temple has not alone himself collected: he has been the cause\nthat many others have collected. In the pages of the Indian\nAntiquary, edited by him, there have appeared from time to time\nfolk-tales collected from all parts of India. Some of these have been\nissued separately. Sets of tales from Southern India, collected by the\nPandit Natesa Sastri, have been issued under the title Folk-Lore of\nSouthern India, three fascicules of which have been recently re-\nissued by Mrs. Kingscote under the title, Tales of the Sun (W.\nH. Allen, 1891): it would have been well if the identity of the two\nworks had been clearly explained. The largest addition to our knowledge\nof the Indian folk-tale that has been made since Wideawake\nStories is that contained in Mr. Knowles’ Folk-Tales of\nKashmir (Trübner’s Oriental Library, 1887), sixty-three stories,\nsome of great length. These, with Mr. Campbell’s Santal Tales\n(1892); Ramaswami Raju’s Indian Fables (London, Sonnenschein,\nn. d.); M. Thornhill, Indian Fairy Tales (London, 1889); and E.\nJ. Robinson, Tales of S. India (1885), together with those\ncontained in books of travel like Thornton’s Bannu or Smeaton’s\nKarens of Burmah bring up the list of printed Indian folk-tales\nto over 350–a respectable total indeed, but a mere drop in the\nocean of the stream of stories that must exist in such a huge\npopulation as that of India: the Central Provinces in particular are\npractically unexplored. There are doubtless many collections still\nunpublished. Col. Lewin has large numbers, besides the few published in\nhis Lushai Grammar; and Mr. M. L. Dames has a number of Baluchi\ntales which I have been privileged to use. Altogether, India now ranks\namong the best represented countries for printed folk-tales, coming\nonly after Russia (1500), Germany (1200), Italy and France (1000 each.)\n[Footnote: Finland boasts of 12,000 but most of these lie unprinted\namong the archives of the Helsingfors Literary Society.] Counting the\nancient with the modern, India has probably some 600 to 700 folk-tales\nprinted and translated in accessible form. There should be enough\nmaterial to determine the vexed question of the relations between the\nEuropean and the Indian collections.",
        "This question has taken a new departure with the researches of M.\nEmanuel Cosquin in his Contes populaires de Lorraine (Paris,\n1886, 2° tirage, 1890), undoubtedly the most important contribution\nto the scientific study of the folk-tale since the Grimms. M. Cosquin\ngives in the annotations to the eighty-four tales which he has\ncollected in Lorraine a mass of information as to the various forms\nwhich the tales take in other countries of Europe and in the East. In\nmy opinion, the work he has done for the European folk-tale is even\nmore valuable than the conclusions he draws from it as to the relations\nwith India. He has taken up the work which Wilhelm Grimm dropped in\n1859, and shown from the huge accumulations of folk-tales that have\nappeared during the last thirty years that there is a common fund of\nfolk-tales which every country of Europe without exception possesses,\nthough this does not of course preclude them from possessing others\nthat are not shared by the rest. M. Cosquin further contends that the\nwhole of these have come from the East, ultimately from India, not by\nliterary transmission, as Benfey contended, but by oral transmission.\nHe has certainly shown that very many of the most striking incidents\ncommon to European folk-tales are also to be found in Eastern\nmährchen. What, however, he has failed to show is that some of\nthese may not have been carried out to the Eastern world by Europeans.\nBorrowing tales is a mutual process, and when Indian meets European,\nEuropean meets Indian; which borrowed from which, is a question which\nwe have very few criteria to decide. It should be added that Mr W. A.\nClouston has in England collected with exemplary industry a large\nnumber of parallels between Indian and European folk-tale incidents in\nhis Popular Tales and Fictions (Edinburgh, 2 vols., 1887) and\nBook of Noodles (London, 1888). Mr Clouston has not openly\nexpressed his conviction that all folk-tales are Indian in origin: he\nprefers to convince us non vi sed saepe cadendo. He has certainly\nmade out a good case for tracing all European drolls, or comic folk-\ntales, from the East.",
        "With the fairy tale strictly so called–i.e., the serious folk-\ntale of romantic adventure–I am more doubtful. It is mainly a modern\nproduct in India as in Europe, so far as literary evidence goes. The\nvast bulk of the Jatakas does not contain a single example worthy the\nname, nor does the Bidpai literature. Some of Somadeva’s tales,\nhowever, approach the nature of fairy tales, but there are several\nCeltic tales which can be traced to an earlier date than his (1200\nA.D.) and are equally near to fairy tales. Yet it is dangerous to trust\nto mere non-appearance in literature as proof of non-existence among\nthe folk. To take our own tales here in England, there is not a single\ninstance of a reference to Jack and the Beanstalk for the last\nthree hundred years, yet it is undoubtedly a true folk-tale. And it is\nindeed remarkable how many of the formulae of fairy tales have\nbeen found of recent years in India. Thus, the Magic Fiddle,\nfound among the Santals by Mr. Campbell in two variants (see Notes on\nvi.), contains the germ idea of the wide-spread story represented in\nGreat Britain by the ballad of Binnorie (see English Fairy\nTales, No. ix.). Similarly, Mr. Knowles’ collection has added\nconsiderably to the number of Indian variants of European “formulae\"\nbeyond those noted by M. Cosquin.",
        "It is still more striking as regards incidents. In a paper read\nbefore the Folk-Lore Congress of 1891, and reprinted in the\nTransactions, pp. 76 seq., I have drawn up a list of some\n630 incidents found in common among European folk-tales (including\ndrolls). Of these, I reckon that about 250 have been already found\namong Indian folk-tales, and the number is increased by each new\ncollection that is made or printed. The moral of this is, that India\nbelongs to a group of peoples who have a common store of stories; India\nbelongs to Europe for purposes of comparative folk-tales.",
        "Can we go further and say that India is the source of all the incidents\nthat are held in common by European children? I think we may answer\n\"Yes” as regards droll incidents, the travels of many of which we can\ntrace, and we have the curious result that European children owe their\nearliest laughter to Hindu wags. As regards the serious incidents\nfurther inquiry is needed. Thus, we find the incident of an “external\nsoul” (Life Index, Captain Temple very appropriately named it) in\nAsbjörnsen’s Norse Tales and in Miss Frere’s Old Deccan\nDays (see Notes on Punchkin). Yet the latter is a very\nsuspicious source, since Miss Frere derived her tales from a Christian\nayah whose family had been in Portuguese Goa for a hundred\nyears. May they not have got the story of the giant with his soul\noutside his body from some European sailor touching at Goa? This is to\na certain extent negatived by the fact of the frequent occurrence of\nthe incident in Indian folk-tales (Captain Temple gave a large number\nof instances in Wideawake Stories, pp. 404-5). On the other\nhand, Mr. Frazer in his Golden Bough has shown the wide spread\nof the idea among all savage or semi-savage tribes. (See Note on No.\niv.)",
        "In this particular case we may be doubtful; but in others, again–as\nthe incident of the rat’s tail up nose (see Notes on The Charmed\nRing)–there can be little doubt of the Indian origin. And\ngenerally, so far as the incidents are marvellous and of true fairy-\ntale character, the presumption is in favour of India, because of the\nvitality of animism or metempsychosis in India throughout all historic\ntime. No Hindu would doubt the fact of animals speaking or of men\ntransformed into plants and animals. The European may once have had\nthese beliefs, and may still hold them implicitly as “survivals\"; but\nin the “survival” stage they cannot afford material for artistic\ncreation, and the fact that the higher minds of Europe for the last\nthousand years have discountenanced these beliefs has not been entirely\nwithout influence. Of one thing there is practical certainty: the fairy\ntales that are common to the Indo-European world were invented once for\nall in a certain locality; and thence spread to all the countries in\nculture contact with the original source. The mere fact that contiguous\ncountries have more similarities in their story store than distant ones\nis sufficient to prove this: indeed, the fact that any single country\nhas spread throughout it a definite set of folk-tales as distinctive as\nits flora and fauna, is sufficient to prove it. It is equally certain\nthat not all folk-tales have come from one source, for each country has\ntales peculiar to itself. The question is as to the source of the tales\nthat are common to all European children, and increasing evidence seems\nto show that this common nucleus is derived from India and India alone.\nThe Hindus have been more successful than others, because of two facts:\nthey have had the appropriate “atmosphere” of metempsychosis, and they\nhave also had spread among the people sufficient literary training and\nmental grip to invent plots. The Hindu tales have ousted the native\nEuropean, which undoubtedly existed independently; indeed, many still\nsurvive, especially in Celtic lands. Exactly in the same way,\nPerrault’s tales have ousted the older English folk-tales, and it is\nwith the utmost difficulty that one can get true English fairy tales\nbecause Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Blue Beard, Puss in\nBoots and the rest, have survived in the struggle for existence\namong English folk-tales. So far as Europe has a common store of fairy\ntales, it owes this to India.",
        "I do not wish to be misunderstood. I do not hold with Benfey that all\nEuropean folk-tales are derived from the Bidpai literature and similar\nliterary products, nor with M. Cosquin that they are all derived from\nIndia. The latter scholar has proved that there is a nucleus of stories\nin every European land which is common to all. I calculate that this\nincludes from 30 to 50 per cent. of the whole, and it is this common\nstock of Europe that I regard as coming from India mainly at the time\nof the Crusades, and chiefly by oral transmission. It includes all the\nbeast tales and most of the drolls, but evidence is still lacking about\nthe more serious fairy tales, though it is increasing with every fresh\ncollection of folk-tales in India, the great importance of which is\nobvious from the above considerations.",
        "In the following Notes I give, as on the two previous occasions, the\nsource whence I derived the tale, then parallels, and finally\nremarks. For Indian parallels I have been able to refer to\nMajor Temple’s remarkable Analysis of Indian Folk-tale incidents at the\nend of Wide-awake Stories (pp. 386-436), for European ones to\nmy alphabetical List of Incidents, with bibliographical references, in\nTransactions of Folk-Lore Congress, 1892, pp. 87-98. My remarks\nhave been mainly devoted to tracing the relation between the Indian\nand the European tales, with the object of showing that the latter\nhave been derived from the former. I have, however, to some extent\nhandicapped myself, as I have avoided giving again the Indian versions\nof stories already given in English Fairy Tales or Celtic Fairy Tales.",

        "Parallels.–I have given a rather full collection of parallels,\nrunning to about a hundred numbers, in my Aesop, pp. 232-4. The\nchief of these are: (i) for the East, the Midrashic version (\"Lion and\nEgyptian Partridge”), in the great Rabbinic commentary on Genesis\n(Bereshith-rabba, c. 64); (2) in classical antiquity, Phaedrus,\ni. 8 (\"Wolf and Crane”), and Babrius, 94 (\"Wolf and Heron”), and the\nGreek proverb Suidas, ii. 248 (\"Out of the Wolf’s Mouth”); (3) in the\nMiddle Ages, the so-called Greek Aesop, ed. Halm, 276 b, really\nprose versions of Babrius and “Romulus,” or prose of Phaedrus, i. 8,\nalso the Romulus of Ademar (fl. 1030), 64; it occurs also on the Bayeux\nTapestry, in Marie de France, 7, and in Benedict of Oxford’s Mishle\nShualim (Heb.), 8; (4) Stainhöwel took it from the “Romulus” into\nhis German Aesop (1480), whence all the modern European Aesops are\nderived.",
        "Remarks.–I have selected The Wolf and the Crane as my\ntypical example in my “History of the Aesopic Fable,” and can only give\nhere a rough summary of the results I there arrived at concerning the\nfable, merely premising that these results are at present no more than\nhypotheses. The similarity of the Jataka form with that familiar to us,\nand derived by us in the last resort from Phaedrus, is so striking that\nfew will deny some historical relation between them. I conjecture that\nthe Fable originated in India, and came West by two different routes.\nFirst, it came by oral tradition to Egypt, as one of the Libyan Fables\nwhich the ancients themselves distinguished from the Aesopic Fables. It\nwas, however, included by Demetrius Phalereus, tyrant of Athens, and\nfounder of the Alexandrian library c. 300 B.C., in his Assemblies of\nAesopic Fables, which I have shown to be the source of Phaedrus’\nFables c. 30 A.D. Besides this, it came from Ceylon in the Fables of\nKybises–i.e., Kasyapa the Buddha–c. 50 A.D., was adapted into Hebrew,\nand used for political purposes, by Rabbi Joshua ben Chananyah in a\nharangue to the Jews c. 120 A.D., begging them to be patient while\nwithin the jaws of Rome. The Hebrew form uses the lion, not the wolf,\nas the ingrate, which enables us to decide on the Indian provenance\nof the Midrashic version. It may be remarked that the use of the lion\nin this and other Jatakas is indirectly a testimony to their great age,\nas the lion has become rarer and rarer in India during historic times,\nand is now confined to the Gir forest of Kathiáwar, where only a dozen\nspecimens exist, and are strictly preserved.",
        "The verses at the end are the earliest parts of the Jataka, being in\nmore archaic Pali than the rest: the story is told by the commentator\n(c. 400 A.D.) to illustrate them. It is probable that they were brought\nover on the first introduction of Buddhism into Ceylon, c. 241 B.C.\nThis would give them an age of over two thousand years, nearly three\nhundred years earlier than Phaedrus, from whom comes our Wolf and\nCrane.",

        "Parallels.–The tabu, as to a particular direction, occurs in\nother Indian stories as well as in European folk-tales (see notes on\nStokes, p. 286). The grateful animals theme occurs in “The\nSoothsayer’s Son” (infra, No. x.), and frequently in Indian\nfolk-tales (see Temple’s Analysis, III. i. 5-7; Wideawake\nStories, pp. 412-3). The thorn in the tiger’s foot is especially\ncommon (Temple, l. c., 6, 9), and recalls the story of Androclus,\nwhich occurs in the derivates of Phaedrus, and may thus be\nIndian in origin (see Benfey, Panschatantra, i. 211, and the\nparallels given in my Aesop, Ro. iii. 1. p. 243). The theme is,\nhowever, equally frequent in European folk-tales: see my List of\nIncidents, Proc. Folk-Lore Congress, p. 91, s.v. “Grateful\nAnimals” and “Gifts by Grateful Animals.” Similarly, the “Bride Wager\"\nincident at the end is common to a large number of Indian and European\nfolk-tales (Temple, Analysis, p. 430; my List, l. c. sub voce).\nThe tasks are also equally common (cf. “Battle of the Birds” in\nCeltic Fairy Tales), though the exact forms as given in\n\"Princess Labam” are not known in Europe.",
        "Remarks.–We have here a concrete instance of the relation of\nIndian and European fairy-tales. The human mind may be the same\neverywhere, but it is not likely to hit upon the sequence of incidents,\nDirection tabu–Grateful Animals–Bride-wager–Tasks, by\naccident, or independently: Europe must have borrowed from India, or\nIndia from Europe. As this must have occurred within historic times,\nindeed within the last thousand years, when even European peasants\nare not likely to have invented, even if they believed, in the incident\nof the grateful animals, the probability is in favour of borrowing from\nIndia, possibly through the intermediation of Arabs at the time of the\nCrusades. It is only a probability, but we cannot in any case reach more\nthan probability in this matter, just at present.",

In my\nnotes on that droll I have pointed out that the pigs were once goats or\nkids with “hair on their chinny chin chin.” This brings the tale a\nstage nearer to the Lambikin.",
        "Remarks.–The similarity of Pig No. 3 rolling down hill in the\nchurn and the Lambikin in the Drumikin can scarcely be accidental,\nthough, it must be confessed, the tale has undergone considerable\nmodification before it reached England.",

        "Parallels.–The son of seven mothers is a characteristic Indian\nconception, for which see Notes on “The Son of Seven Queens” in this\ncollection, No. xvi. The mother transformed, envious stepmother, ring\nrecognition, are all incidents common to East and West; bibliographical\nreferences for parallels may be found under these titles in my List of\nIncidents. The external soul of the ogre has been studied by Mr. E.\nClodd in Folk-Lore Journal, vol. ii., “The Philosophy of\nPunchkin,” and still more elaborately in the section, “The External\nSoul in Folk-tales,” in Mr. Frazer’s Golden Bough, ii. pp. 296-\n326. See also Major Temple’s Analysis, II. iii., Wideawake\nStories, pp. 404-5, who there gives the Indian parallels.",
        "Remarks.–Both Mr. Clodd and Mr. Frazer regard the essence of\nthe tale to consist in the conception of an external soul or “life-\nindex,” and they both trace in this a “survival” of savage philosophy,\nwhich they consider occurs among all men at a certain stage of culture.\nBut the most cursory examination of the sets of tales containing these\nincidents in Mr. Frazer’s analyses shows that many, indeed the\nmajority, of these tales cannot be independent of one another; for they\ncontain not alone the incident of an external materialised soul, but\nthe further point that this is contained in something else, which is\nenclosed in another thing, which is again surrounded by a wrapper. This\nChinese ball arrangement is found in the Deccan (\"Punchkin”); in Bengal\n(Day, Folk-Tales of Bengal); in Russia (Ralston, p. 103\nseq., “Koschkei the Deathless,” also in Mr. Lang’s Red Fairy\nBook); in Servia (Mijatovics, Servian Folk-Lore, p. 172); in\nSouth Slavonia (Wratislaw, p. 225); in Rome (Miss Busk, p. 164); in\nAlbania (Dozon, p. 132 seq.); in Transylvania (Haltrich, No.\n34); in Schleswig-Holstein (Müllenhoff, p. 404); in Norway\n(Asbjörnsen, No. 36, ap. Dasent, Pop. Tales, p. 55, “The\nGiant who had no Heart in his Body”); and finally, in the Hebrides\n(Campbell, Pop. Tales, p. 10, cf. Celtic Fairy Tales, No.\nxvii., “Sea Maiden”). Here we have the track of this remarkable idea of\nan external soul enclosed in a succession of wrappings, which we can\ntrace from Hindostan to the Hebrides.",
        "It is difficult to imagine that we have not here the actual migration\nof the tale from East to West. In Bengal we have the soul “in a\nnecklace, in a box, in the heart of a boal fish, in a tank\"; in\nAlbania “it is in a pigeon, in a hare, in the silver tusk of a wild\nboar\"; in Rome it is “in a stone, in the head of a bird, in the head of\na leveret, in the middle head of a seven-headed hydra\"; in Russia “it\nis in an egg, in a duck, in a hare, in a casket, in an oak\"; in Servia\nit is “in a board, in the heart of a fox, in a mountain\"; in\nTransylvania “it is in a light, in an egg, in a duck, in a pond, in a\nmountain;” in Norway it is “in an egg, in a duck, in a well, in a\nchurch, on an island, in a lake\"; in the Hebrides it is “in an egg, in\nthe belly of a duck, in the belly of a wether, under a flagstone on the\nthreshold.” It is impossible to imagine the human mind independently\nimagining such bizarre convolutions. They were borrowed from one nation\nto the other, and till we have reason shown to the contrary, the\noriginal lender was a Hindu. I should add that the mere conception of\nan external soul occurs in the oldest Egyptian tale of “The Two\nBrothers,” but the wrappings are absent.",
        "Source.–Pantschatantra, V. ix., tr. Benfey, ii. 345-6.",
        "Parallels.–Benfey, in § 209 of his Einleitung, gives\nbibliographical references to most of those which are given at length in\nProf. M. Müller’s brilliant essay on “The Migration of Fables\"\n(Selected Essays, i. 500-76), which is entirely devoted to the\ntravels of the fable from India to La Fontaine. See also Mr. Clouston,\nPop. Tales, ii. 432 seq. I have translated the Hebrew version\nin my essay, “Jewish Influence on the Diffusion of Folk-Tales,” pp. 6-7.\nOur proverb, “Do not count your chickens before they are hatched,” is\nultimately to be derived from India.",
        "Remarks–The stories of Alnaschar, the Barber’s fifth brother in the\nArabian Nights, and of La Perette, who counted her chickens\nbefore they were hatched, in La Fontaine, are demonstrably derived from\nthe same Indian original from which our story was obtained. The travels\nof the “Fables of Bidpai” from India to Europe are well known and\ndistinctly traceable. I have given a rough summary of the chief\ncritical results in the introduction to my edition of the earliest\nEnglish version of the Fables of Bidpai, by Sir Thomas North, of\nPlutarch fame (London, D. Nutt, “Bibliothèque de Carabas,” 1888), where\nI have given an elaborate genealogical table of the multitudinous\nversions. La Fontaine’s version, which has rendered the fable so\nfamiliar to us all, comes from Bonaventure des Periers, Contes et\nNouvelles, who got it from the Dialogus Creaturarum of Nicholaus\nPergamenus, who derived it from the Sermones of Jacques de Vitry\n(see Prof. Crane’s edition, No. li.), who probably derived it from the\nDirectorium Humanae Vitae of John of Capua, a converted Jew,\nwho translated it from the Hebrew version of the Arabic Kalilah wa\nDimnah, which was itself derived from the old Syriac version of a\nPehlevi translation of the original Indian work, probably called after\nKarataka and Damanaka, the names of two jackals who figure in the\nearlier stories of the book. Prof. Rhys-Davids informs me that these names\nare more akin to Pali than to Sanskrit, which makes it still more probable\nthat the whole literature is ultimately to be derived from a Buddhist\nsource.",
        "The theme of La Perette is of interest as showing the literary\ntransmission of tales from Orient to Occident. It also shows the\npossibility of an influence of literary on oral tradition, as is shown\nby our proverb, and by the fact, which Benfey mentions, that La\nFontaine’s story has had influence on two of Grimm’s tales, Nos. 164,\n168.",
        "Source.–A. Campbell, Santal Folk-Tales, 1892, pp. 52-6,\nwith some verbal alterations. A Bonga is the presiding spirit of a\ncertain kind of rice land; Doms and Hadis are low-caste aborigines,\nwhose touch is considered polluting. The Santals are a forest tribe,\nwho live in the Santal Parganas, 140 miles N. W. of Calcutta (Sir W. W.\nHunter, The Indian Empire, 57-60).",
        "Parallels.–Another version occurs in Campbell, p. 106\nseq., which shows that the story is popular among the Santals.\nIt is obvious, however, that neither version contains the real finish\nof the story, which must have contained the denunciation of the magic\nfiddle of the murderous sisters. This would bring it under the formula\nof The Singing Bone, which M. Monseur has recently been studying\nwith a remarkable collection of European variants in the Bulletin of\nthe Wallon Folk-Lore Society of Liège (cf. Eng. Fairy Tales, No.\nix.). There is a singing bone in Steel-Temple’s Wideawake\nStories, pp. 127 seq. (\"Little Anklebone”).",

        "Parallels.–This Jataka got into the Bidpai literature, and\noccurs in all its multitudinous offshoots (see Benfey, Einleitung,\n§ 60) among others in the earliest English translation by North (my\nedition, pp. 118-22), where the crane becomes “a great Paragone of\nIndia (of those that live a hundredth yeares and never mue their\nfeathers).” The crab, on hearing the ill news “called to Parliament all the\nFishes of the Lake,” and before all are devoured destroys the Paragon,\nas in the Jataka, and returned to the remaining fishes, who “all with one\nconsent gave hir many a thanke.”",
        "Remarks.–An interesting point, to which I have drawn attention\nin my Introduction to North’s Bidpai, is the probability that the\nillustrations of the tales as well as the tales themselves, were\ntranslated, so to speak, from one country to another. We can trace them\nin Latin, Hebrew, and Arabic MSS., and a few are extant on Buddhist\nStupas. Under these circumstances, it may be of interest to compare\nwith Mr. Batten’s conception of the Crane and the Crab (supra,\np. 50) that of the German artist who illustrated the first edition of\nthe Latin Bidpai, probably following the traditional representations of\nthe MS., which itself could probably trace back to India.",

Ant. xii. 177; and a couple more in my Aesop,\np. 253: add Smeaton, Karens, p. 126.",
        "Remarks.–Prof. Krohn comes to the conclusion that the majority\nof the oral forms of the tale come from literary versions (p. 47),\nwhereas the Reynard form has only had influence on a single\nvariant. He reduces the century of variants to three type forms. The\nfirst occurs in two Egyptian versions collected in the present day, as\nwell as in Petrus Alphonsi in the twelfth century, and the Fabulae\nExtravagantes of the thirteenth or fourteenth: here the ingrate\nanimal is a crocodile, which asks to be carried away from a river about\nto dry up, and there is only one judge. The second is that current in\nIndia and represented by the story in the present collection: here the\njudges are three. The third is that current among Western Europeans,\nwhich has spread to S. Africa and N. and S. America: also three judges.\nProf. K. Krohn counts the first the original form, owing to the single\njudge and the naturalness of the opening, by which the critical\nsituation is brought about. The further question arises, whether this\nform, though found in Egypt now, is indigenous there, and if so, how it\ngot to the East. Prof. Krohn grants the possibility of the Egyptian\nform having been invented in India and carried to Egypt, and he allows\nthat the European forms have been influenced by the Indian. The\n\"Egyptian” form is found in Burmah (Smeaton, l. c., p. 128), as\nwell as the Indian, a fact of which Prof. K. Krohn was unaware though\nit turns his whole argument. The evidence we have of other folk-tales\nof the beast-epic emanating from India improves the chances of this\nalso coming from that source. One thing at least is certain: all these\nhundred variants come ultimately from one source. The incident “Inside\nagain” of the Arabian Nights (the Djinn and the bottle) and\nEuropean tales is also a secondary derivate.",

R. Morris, Folk-Lore Jour. iii. 348 seq. The story\nof the ingratitude of man compared with the gratitude of beasts came\nearly to the West, where it occurs in the Gesta Romanorum, c.\n119. It was possibly from an early form of this collection that Richard\nCoeur de Lion got the story, and used it to rebuke the ingratitude of\nthe English nobles on his return in 1195. Matthew Paris tells the\nstory, sub anno (it is an addition of his to Ralph Disset),\nHist. Major, ed. Luard, ii. 413-6, how a lion and a serpent and\na Venetian named Vitalis were saved from a pit by a woodman, Vitalis\npromising him half his fortune, fifty talents. The lion brings his\nbenefactor a leveret, the serpent “gemmam pretiosam,” probably “the\nprecious jewel in his head” to which Shakespeare alludes (As You\nLike It, ii. 1., cf. Benfey, l.c., p. 214, n.), but Vitalis\nrefuses to have anything to do with him, and altogether repudiates the\nfifty talents. “Haec referebat Rex Richardus munificus, ingratos\nredarguendo.”",
        "Remarks.–Apart from the interest of its wide travels, and its\nappearance in the standard mediaeval History of England by Matthew\nParis, the modern story shows the remarkable persistence of folk-tales\nin the popular mind. Here we have collected from the Hindu peasant of\nto-day a tale which was probably told before Buddha, over two thousand\nyears ago, and certainly included among the Jatakas before the\nChristian era. The same thing has occurred with The Tiger, Brahman,\nand Jackal (No. ix. supra).",

The usual form of discovery of the thieves is for\nthe Dr. Knowall to have so many days given him to discover the thieves,\nand at the end of the first day he calls out, “There’s one of them,\"\nmeaning the days, just as one of the thieves peeps through at him.\nHence the title and the plot of C.

It is impossible to imagine that\nincident–occurring in the same series of incidents–to have been\ninvented more than once, and if that part of the story has been\nborrowed from India, there is no reason why the whole of it should not\nhave arisen in India, and have been spread to the West. The English\nvariant was derived from an English Gipsy, and suggests the possibility\nthat for this particular story the medium of transmission has been the\nGipsies.

        "Parallels.–Most readers of these Notes will remember the\ncentral episode of Mr. J. C. Harris’ Uncle Remus, in which Brer\nFox, annoyed at Brer Rabbit’s depredations, fits up “a contrapshun,\nwhat he calls a Tar Baby.” Brer Rabbit, coming along that way, passes\nthe time of day with Tar Baby, and, annoyed at its obstinate silence,\nhits it with right fist and with left, with left fist and with right,\nwhich successively stick to the “contrapshun,” till at last he butts\nwith his head, and that sticks too, whereupon Brer Fox, who all this\ntime had “lain low,” saunters out, and complains of Brer Rabbit that he\nis too stuck up. In the sequel Brer Rabbits begs Brer Fox that he may\n\"drown me as deep ez you please, skin me, scratch out my eyeballs, t’ar\nout my years by the roots, en cut off my legs, but do don’t fling me in\ndat brier patch;” which, of course, Brer Fox does, only to be informed\nby the cunning Brer Rabbit that he had been “bred en bawn in a brier\npatch.” The story is a favourite one with the negroes: it occurs in\nCol. Jones’ Negro Myths of the Georgia Coast (Uncle Remus is\nfrom S. Carolina), also among those of Brazil (Romero, Contos do\nBrazil), and in the West Indian Islands (Mr. Lang, “At the Sign of\nthe Ship,” Longman’s Magazine, Feb. 1889). We can trace it to\nAfrica, where it occurs in Cape Colony (South African Folk-Lore\nJournal, vol. i.).",
        "Remarks.–The five-fold attack on the Demon and the Tar Baby is\nso preposterously ludicrous that it cannot have been independently\ninvented, and we must therefore assume that they are causally\nconnected, and the existence of the variant in South Africa clinches\nthe matter, and gives us a landing-stage between India and America.\nThere can be little doubt that the Jataka of Prince Five-Weapons came\nto Africa, possibly by Buddhist missionaries, spread among the negroes,\nand then took ship in the holds of slavers for the New World, where it\nis to be found in fuller form than any yet discovered in the home of\nits birth. I say Buddhist missionaries, because there is a certain\namount of evidence that the negroes have Buddhistic symbols among them,\nand we can only explain the identification of Brer Rabbit with Prince\nFive Weapons, and so with Buddha himself, by supposing the change to\nhave originated among Buddhists, where it would be quite natural. For\none of the most celebrated metempsychoses of Buddha is that detailed in\nthe Sasa Jataka (Fausböll, No. 316, tr. R. Morris, Folk-Lore\nJournal, ii. 336), in which the Buddha, as a hare, performs a\nsublime piece of self-sacrifice, and as a reward is translated to the\nmoon, where he can be seen to this day as “the hare in the moon.” Every\nBuddhist is reminded of the virtue of self-sacrifice whenever the moon\nis full, and it is easy to understand how the Buddha became identified\nas the Hare or Rabbit. A striking confirmation of this, in connection\nwith our immediate subject, is offered by Mr. Harris’ sequel volume,\nNights with Uncle Remus. Here there is a whole chapter (xxx.) on\n\"Brer Rabbit and his famous Foot,” and it is well known how the worship\nof Buddha’s foot developed in later Buddhism. No wonder Brer Rabbit is\nso ’cute: he is nothing less than an incarnation of Buddha. Among the\nKarens of Burmah, where Buddhist influence is still active, the Hare\nholds exactly the same place in their folk-lore as Brer Rabbit among\nthe negroes. The sixth chapter of Mr. Smeaton’s book on them is devoted\nto “Fireside Stories,” and is entirely taken up with adventures of the\nHare, all of which can be paralleled from Uncle Remus.",
        "Curiously enough, the negro form of the five-fold attack–\"fighting\nwith five fists,” Mr. Barr would call it–is probably nearer to\nthe original legend than that preserved in the Jataka, though 2000\nyears older. For we may be sure that the thunderbolt of Knowledge did\nnot exist in the original, but was introduced by some Buddhist Mr.\nBarlow, who, like Alice’s Duchess, ended all his tales with: “And the\nmoral of that is––” For no well-bred demon would have been taken in\nby so simple a “sell” as that indulged in by Prince Five-Weapons in our\nJataka, and it is probable, therefore, that Uncle Remus preserves a\nreminiscence of the original Indian reading of the tale. On the other\nhand, it is probable that Carlyle’s Indian god with the fire in his\nbelly was derived from Prince Five-Weapons.",
        "The negro variant has also suggested to Mr. Batten an explanation of\nthe whole story which is extremely plausible, though it introduces a\nmethod of folk-lore exegesis which has been overdriven to death. The\nSasa Jataka identifies the Brer Rabbit Buddha with the hare in\nthe moon. It is well known that Easterns explain an eclipse of the moon\nas due to its being swallowed up by a Dragon or Demon. May not, asks\nMr. Batten, the Pancavudha Jataka be an idealised account of an\neclipse of the moon? This suggestion receives strong confirmation from\nthe Demon’s reference to Rahu, who does, in Indian myth swallow the\nmoon at times of eclipse. The Jataka accordingly contains the Buddhist\nexplanation why the moon–i.e. the hare in the moon, i.e.\nBuddha–is not altogether swallowed up by the Demon of Eclipse, the\nDemon with the Matted Hair. Mr. Batten adds that in imagining what kind\nof Demon the Eclipse Demon was, the Jataka writer was probably aided by\nrecollections of some giant octopus, who has saucer eyes and a kind of\nhawk’s beak, knobs on its “tusks,” and a very variegated belly\n(gastropod). It is obviously unfair of Mr. Batten both to illustrate\nand also to explain so well the Tar Baby Jataka–taking the scientific\nbread, so to speak, out of a poor folklorist’s mouth–but his\nexplanations seem to me so convincing that I cannot avoid including\nthem in these Notes.",
        "I am, however, not so much concerned with the original explanation of\nthe Jataka as to trace its travels across the continents of Asia,\nAfrica, and America. I think I have done this satisfactorily, and will\nhave thereby largely strengthened the case for less extensive travels\nof other tales. I have sufficient confidence of the method employed to\nventure on that most hazardous of employments, scientific prophecy. I\nventure to predict that the Tar Baby story will be found in Madagascar\nin a form nearer the Indian than Uncle Remus, and I will go further,\nand say that it will not be found in the grand Helsingfors\ncollection of folk-tales, though this includes 12,000, of which 1000\nare beast-tales.",

        "Remarks.–Mr. Gomme is of opinion that the tale arose from\ncertain rhyming formulae occurring in the Gaelic and Latin tales as\nwritten on a mallet left by the old man in the box opened after his\ndeath. The rhymes are to the effect that a father who gives up his\nwealth to his children in his own lifetime deserves to be put to death\nwith the mallet. Mr. Gomme gives evidence that it was an archaic custom\nto put oldsters to death after they had become helpless. He also points\nout that it was customary for estates to be divided and surrendered\nduring the owners’ lifetime, and generally he connects a good deal of\nprimitive custom with our story. I have already pointed out in Folk-\nLore, p. 403, that the existence of the tale in Kashmir without any\nreference to the mallet makes it impossible for the rhymes on the\nmallet to be the source of the story. As a matter of fact, it is a very\nembarrassing addition to it, since the rhyme tells against the parent,\nand the story is intended to tell against the ungrateful children. The\nexistence of the tale in India renders it likely enough that it is not\nindigenous to the British Isles, but an Oriental importation. It is\nobvious, therefore, that it cannot be used as anthropological evidence\nof the existence of the primitive customs to be found in it. The whole\nincident, indeed, is a striking example of the dangers of the\nanthropological method of dealing with folk-tales before some attempt\nis made to settle the questions of origin and diffusion.",
