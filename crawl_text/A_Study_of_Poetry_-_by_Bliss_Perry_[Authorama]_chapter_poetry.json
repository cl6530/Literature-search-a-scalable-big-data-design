        "The method of studying poetry which I have followed in this book was\nsketched some years ago in my chapter on “Poetry” in Counsel Upon the\nReading of Books. My confidence that the genetic method is the natural\nway of approaching the subject has been shared by many lovers of poetry.\nI hope, however, that I have not allowed my insistence upon the threefold\nprocess of “impression, transforming imagination, and expression” to\nharden into a set formula. Formulas have a certain dangerous usefulness\nfor critics and teachers, but they are a very small part of one’s training\nin the appreciation of poetry.",
        "I have allotted little or no space to the specific discussion of epic and\ndrama, as these types are adequately treated in many books. Our own\ngeneration is peculiarly attracted by various forms of the lyric, and in\nPart Two I have devoted especial attention to that field.",
        "While I hope that the book may attract the traditional “general reader,\"\nI have also tried to arrange it in such a fashion that it may be utilized\nin the classroom. I have therefore ventured, in the Notes and\nIllustrations and Appendix, to suggest some methods and material for the\nuse of students.",
        "I wish to express my obligations to Professor R. M. Alden, whose\nIntroduction to Poetry and English Verse I have used in my own Harvard\ncourses in poetry. His views of metre have probably influenced mine even\nmore than I am aware. The last decade, which has witnessed such an\nextraordinary revival of interest in poetry, has produced many valuable\ncontributions to poetic theory. I have found Professor Fairchild’s Making\nof Poetry particularly suggestive. Attention is called, in the Notes and\nBibliography, to many other recent books on the subject.",
        "Professors A. S. Cook of Yale and F. B. Snyder of Northwestern University\nhave been kind enough to read in manuscript certain chapters of this book,\nand Dr. P. F. Baum of Harvard has assisted me most courteously. I am\nindebted to several fellow-writers for their consent to the use of\nextracts from their books, particularly to Brander Matthews for a passage\nfrom These Many Years and to Henry Osborn Taylor for a passage from his\nClassical Heritage of the Middle Ages.",
        "I wish also to thank the publishers who have generously allowed me to use\nbrief quotations from copyrighted books, especially Henry Holt & Co. for\npermission to use a quotation and drawing from William James’s\nPsychology, and The Macmillan Company for permission to borrow from John\nLa Farge’s delightful Considerations on Painting.",

        "A GLANCE AT THE BACKGROUND",
        "It is a gray day in autumn. I am sitting at my desk, wondering how to\nbegin the first chapter of this book about poetry. Outside the window\na woman is contentedly kneeling on the upturned brown earth of her\ntulip-bed, patting lovingly with her trowel as she covers the bulbs\nfor next spring’s blossoming. Does she know Katharine Tynan’s verses\nabout “Planting Bulbs”? Probably not. But I find myself dropping the\nprocrastinating pen, and murmuring some of the lines:",
        "  “Setting my bulbs a-row\n    In cold earth under the grasses,\n  Till the frost and the snow\n    Are gone and the Winter passes–",
        "  “Turning the sods and the clay\n    I think on the poor sad people\n  Hiding their dead away\n    In the churchyard, under the steeple.",
        "  “All poor women and men,\n    Broken-hearted and weeping,\n  Their dead they call on in vain,\n    Quietly smiling and sleeping.",
        "  “Friends, now listen and hear,\n    Give over crying and grieving,\n  There shall come a day and a year\n    When the dead shall be as the living.",
        "  “There shall come a call, a foot-fall,\n    And the golden trumpeters blowing\n  Shall stir the dead with their call,\n    Bid them be rising and going.",
        "  “Then in the daffodil weather,\n    Lover shall run to lover;\n  Friends all trooping together;\n    Death and Winter be over.",
        "  “Laying my bulbs in the dark,\n    Visions have I of hereafter.\n  Lip to lip, breast to breast, hark!\n    No more weeping, but laughter!”",
        "Yet this is no way to start your chapter, suggests Conscience. Why do you\nnot write an opening paragraph, for better for worse, instead of looking\nout of the window and quoting Katharine Tynan? And then it flashes over\nme, in lieu of answer, that I have just discovered one way of beginning\nthe chapter, after all! For what I should like to do in this book is to\nset forth in decent prose some of the strange potencies of verse: its\npower, for instance, to seize upon a physical image like that of a woman\nplanting bulbs, and transmute it into a symbol of the resurrection of the\ndead; its capacity for turning fact into truth and brown earth into\nbeauty; for remoulding the broken syllables of human speech into sheer\nmusic; for lifting the mind, bowed down by wearying thought and haunting\nfear, into a brooding ecstasy wherein weeping is changed into laughter and\nautumnal premonitions of death into assurance of life, and the narrow\npaths of individual experience are widened into those illimitable spaces\nwhere the imagination rules. Poetry does all this, assuredly. But how? And\nwhy? That is our problem.",
        "“The future of poetry is immense,” declared Matthew Arnold, and there are\nfew lovers of literature who doubt his triumphant assertion. But the past\nof poetry is immense also: impressive in its sheer bulk and in its\nimmemorial duration. At a period earlier than any recorded history, poetry\nseems to have occupied the attention of men, and some of the finest\nspirits in every race that has attained to civilization have devoted\nthemselves to its production, or at least given themselves freely to the\nenjoyment of reciting and reading verse, and of meditating upon its\nsignificance. A consciousness of this rich human background should\naccompany each new endeavor to examine the facts about poetry and to\ndetermine its essential nature. The facts are indeed somewhat complicated,\nand the nature of poetry, in certain aspects of it, at least, will remain\nas always a mystery. Yet in that very complication and touch of mystery\nthere is a fascination which has laid its spell upon countless generations\nof men, and which has been deepened rather than destroyed by the advance\nof science and the results of scholarship. The study of folklore and\ncomparative literature has helped to explain some of the secrets of\npoetry; the psychological laboratory, the history of criticism, the\ninvestigation of linguistics, the modern developments in music and the\nother arts, have all contributed something to our intelligent enjoyment of\nthe art of poetry and to our sense of its importance in the life of\nhumanity. There is no field of inquiry where the interrelations of\nknowledge are more acutely to be perceived. The beginner in the study of\npoetry may at once comfort himself and increase his zest by remembering\nthat any real training which he has already had in scientific observation,\nin the habit of analysis, in the study of races and historic periods, in\nthe use of languages, in the practice or interpretation of any of the fine\narts, or even in any bodily exercise that has developed his sense of\nrhythm, will be of ascertainable value to him in this new study.",
        "But before attempting to apply his specific knowledge or aptitude to the\nnew field for investigation, he should be made aware of some of the wider\nquestions which the study of poetry involves. The first of these questions\nhas to do with the relations of the study of poetry to the general field\nof Aesthetics.",
        "1. The Study of Poetry and the Study of Aesthetics\nThe Greeks invented a convenient word to describe the study of poetry:\n\"Poetics.” Aristotle’s famous fragmentary treatise bore that title, and it\nwas concerned with the nature and laws of certain types of poetry and with\nthe relations of poetry to the other arts. For the Greeks assumed, as we\ndo, that poetry is an art: that it expresses emotion through words\nrhythmically arranged. But as soon as they began to inquire into the\nparticular kind of emotion which is utilized in poetry and the various\nrhythmical arrangements employed by poets, they found themselves compelled\nto ask further questions. How do the other arts convey feeling? What\narrangement or rhythmic ordering of facts do they use in this process?\nWhat takes place in us as we confront the work of art, or, in other words,\nwhat is our reaction to an artistic stimulus?",
        "For an answer to such wider questions as these, we moderns turn to the\nso-called science of Aesthetics. This word, derived from the Greek\naisthanomai (to perceive), has been defined as “anything having to do\nwith perception by the senses.” But it was first used in its present sense\nby the German thinker Baumgarten in the middle of the eighteenth century.\nHe meant by it “the theory of the fine arts.” It has proved a convenient\nterm to describe both “The Science of the Beautiful” and “The Philosophy\nof Beauty\"; that is, both the analysis and classification of beautiful\nthings as well as speculation as to the origin and nature of Beauty\nitself. But it should be borne in mind that aesthetic inquiry and answer\nmay precede by thousands of years the use of the formal language of\naesthetic theory. Mr. Kipling’s “Story of Ung” cleverly represents the\ncave-men as discussing the very topics which the contemporary studio and\nclassroom strive in vain to settle,–in vain, because they are the eternal\nproblems of art. Here are two faces, two trees, two colors, one of which\nseems preferable to the other. Wherein lies the difference, as far as the\nobjects themselves are concerned? And what is it which the preferable face\nor tree or color stirs or awakens within us as we look at it? These are\nwhat we call aesthetic questions, but a man or a race may have a delicate\nand sure sense of beauty without consciously asking such questions at all.\nThe awareness of beautiful objects in nature, and even the ability to\ncreate a beautiful work of art, may not be accompanied by any gift for\naesthetic speculation. Conversely, many a Professor of aesthetics has\ncontentedly lived in an ugly house and you would not think that he had\never looked at river or sky or had his pulses quickened by a tune.\nNevertheless, no one can turn the pages of a formal History of Aesthetics\nwithout being reminded that the oldest and apparently the most simple\ninquiries in this field may also be the subtlest and in a sense the most\nmodern. For illustration, take the three philosophical contributions of\nthe Greeks to aesthetic theory, as they are stated by Bosanquet:\n[Footnote: Bosanquet, History of Aesthetic, chap. 3.]\n(1) the conception that art deals with images, not realities, i.e. with\naesthetic “semblance” or things as they appear to the artist;\n(2) the conception that art consists in “imitation,” which they carried to\nan absurdity, indeed, by arguing that an imitation must be less “valuable\"\nthan the thing imitated;\n(3) the conception that beauty consists in certain formal relations, such\nas symmetry, harmony of parts–in a word, “unity in variety.”",
        "Now no one can snap a Kodak effectively without putting into practice the\nfirst of these conceptions: nor understand the “new music” and “free\nverse” without reckoning with both the second and the third. The value to\nthe student of poetry of some acquaintance with aesthetic theory is\nsometimes direct, as in the really invaluable discussion contained in\nAristotle’s Poetics, but more often, perhaps, it will be found in the\nindirect stimulus to his sympathy and taste. For he must survey the\nwidespread sense of beauty in the ancient world, the splendid periods of\nartistic creation in the Middle Ages, the growth of a new feeling for\nlandscape and for the richer and deeper human emotions, and the emergence\nof the sense of the “significant” or individually “characteristic” in\nthe work of art. Finally he may come to lose himself with Kant or Hegel or\nColeridge in philosophical theories about the nature of beauty, or to\nfollow the curious analyses of experimental aesthetics in modern\nlaboratories, where the psycho-physical reactions to aesthetic stimuli are\ncunningly registered and the effects of lines and colors and tones upon\nthe human organism are set forth with mathematical precision. He need not\ntrouble himself overmuch at the outset with definitions of Beauty. The\nchief thing is to become aware of the long and intimate preoccupation of\nmen with beautiful objects and to remember that any inquiry into the\nnature and laws of poetry will surely lead him into a deeper curiosity as\nto the nature and manifestations of aesthetic feeling in general.",
        "2. The Impulse to Artistic Production\nFurthermore, no one can ask himself how it is that a poem comes into being\nunless he also raises the wider question as to the origin and working of\nthe creative impulse in the other arts. It is clear that there is a gulf\nbetween the mere sense of beauty–such as is possessed by primitive man,\nor, in later stages of civilization, by the connoisseur in the fine\narts–and the concrete work of art. Thousands enjoy the statue, the\nsymphony, the ode; not one in a thousand can produce these objects.\nMere connoisseurship is sterile. “The ability to produce one fine line,\"\nsaid Edward FitzGerald, “transcends all the Able-Editor ability in this\nably-edited universe.” What is the impulse which urges certain persons to\ncreate beautiful objects? How is it that they cross the gulf which\nseparates the enjoyer from the producer?",
        "It is easier to ask this question than to find a wholly satisfactory\nanswer to it. Plato’s explanation, in the case of the poet, is simple\nenough: it is the direct inspiration of the divinity,–the “god” takes\npossession of the poet. Perhaps this may be true, in a sense, and we shall\nrevert to it later, but first let us look at some of the conditions for\nthe exercise of the creative impulse, as contemporary theorists have\nendeavored to explain them.",
        "Social relations, surely, afford one of the obvious conditions for the\nimpulse to art. The hand-clapping and thigh-smiting of primitive savages\nin a state of crowd-excitement, the song-and-dance before admiring\nspectators, the chorus of primitive ballads,–the crowd repeating and\naltering the refrains,–the rhythmic song of laboring men and of women at\ntheir weaving, sailors’ “chanties,” the celebration of funeral rites,\nreligious processional and pageant, are all expressions of communal\nfeeling, and it is this communal feeling–\"the sense of joy in widest\ncommonalty spread\"–which has inspired, in Greece and Italy, some of the\ngreatest artistic epochs. It is true that as civilization has proceeded,\nthis communal emotion has often seemed to fade away and leave us in the\npresence of the individual artist only. We see Keats sitting at his garden\ntable writing the “Ode to Autumn,” the lonely Shelley in the Cascine at\nFlorence composing the “West Wind,” Wordsworth pacing the narrow walk\nbehind Dove Cottage and mumbling verses, Beethoven in his garret writing\nmusic. But the creative act thus performed in solitude has a singular\npotency, after all, for arousing that communal feeling which in the moment\nof creation the artist seems to escape. What he produces in his loneliness\nthe world does not willingly let die. His work, as far as it becomes\nknown, really unites mankind. It fulfills a social purpose. “Its function\nis social consolidation.”",
        "Tolstoy made so much of this “transmission of emotion,” this “infectious\"\nquality of art as a means of union among men, that he reduced a good case\nto an absurdity, for he argued himself into thinking that if a given work\nof art does not infect the spectator–and preferably the uneducated\n\"peasant” spectator–with emotion, it is therefore not art at all. He\noverlooked the obvious truth that there are certain types of difficult\nor intricate beauty–in music, in architecture, and certainly in\npoetry–which so tax the attention and the analytical and reflective\npowers of the spectator as to make the inexperienced, uncultured spectator\nor hearer simply unaware of the presence of beauty. Debussy’s music,\nBrowning’s dramatic monologues, Henry James’s short stories, were not\nwritten for Tolstoy’s typical peasant. They would “transmit” to him\nnothing at all. But although Tolstoy, a man of genius, overstated his case\nwith childlike perversity, he did valuable service in insisting upon\nemotion as a basis for the art-impulse. The creative instinct is\nundeniably accompanied by strong feeling, by pleasure in the actual work\nof production and in the resultant object, and something of this pleasure\nin the harmonious expression of emotion is shared by the competent\nobserver. The permanent vitality of a work of art does consist in its\ncapacity for stimulating and transmitting pleasure. One has only to think\nof Gray’s “Elegy” and the delight which it has afforded to generations of\nmen.",
        "Another conception of the artistic impulse seeks to ally it with the\n\"play-instinct.” According to Kant and Schiller there is a free “kingdom\nof play” between the urgencies of necessity and of duty, and in this\nsphere of freedom a man’s whole nature has the chance to manifest itself.\nHe is wholly man only when he “plays,” that is, when he is free to create.\nHerbert Spencer and many subsequent theorists have pointed out the analogy\nbetween the play of young animals, the free expression of their surplus\nenergy, their organic delight in the exercise of their muscles, and that\n\"playful” expenditure of a surplus of vitality which seems to characterize\nthe artist. This analogy is curiously suggestive, though it is\ninsufficient to account for all the phenomena concerned in human artistic\nproduction.",
        "The play theory, again, suggests that old and clairvoyant perception of\nthe Greeks that the art-impulse deals with aesthetic appearances rather\nthan with realities as such. The artist has to do with the semblance of\nthings; not with things as they “are in themselves” either physically or\nlogically, but with things as they appear to him. The work of the\nimpressionist painter or the imagist poet illustrates this conception. The\nconventions of the stage are likewise a case in point. Stage settings,\nconversations, actions, are all affected by the ’optique du théâtre“\nthey are composed in a certain “key” which seeks to give a harmonious\nimpression, but which conveys frankly semblance and not reality. The\ncraving for “real” effects upon the stage is anti-aesthetic, like those\ngladiatorial shows where persons were actually killed. I once saw an\nunskilful fencer, acting the part of Romeo, really wound Tybalt: the\neffect was lifelike, beyond question, but it was shocking.",
        "From this doctrine of aesthetic semblance or “appearance” many thinkers\nhave drawn the conclusion that the pleasures afforded by art must in their\nvery nature be disinterested and sharable. Disinterested, because they\nconsist so largely in delighted contemplation merely. Women on the stage,\nsaid Coquelin, should afford to the spectator “a theatrical pleasure only,\nand not the pleasure of a lover.” Compare with this the sprightly egotism\nof the lyric poet’s",
        "  “If she be not so to me,\n  What care I how fair she be?”",
        "A certain aloofness is often felt to characterize great art: it is\nperceived in the austerity and reserve of the Psyche of Naples and the\nVenus of Melos:",
        "  “And music pours on mortals\n  Its beautiful disdain.”",
        "The lower pleasures of the senses of taste and touch, it is often pointed\nout, are less pleasurable than the other senses when revived by memory.\nYour dinner is your dinner–your exclusive proprietorship of lower\npleasure–in a sense in which the snowy linen and gleaming silver and\nradiant flowers upon the table are not yours only because they are\nsharable. If music follows the dinner, though it be your favorite tune, it\nis nevertheless not yours as what you have eaten is yours. Acute observers\nlike Santayana have denied or minimized this distinction, but the general\ninstinct of men persists in calling the pleasures of color and form and\nsound “sharable,” because they exist for all who can appreciate them.\nThe individual’s happiness in these pleasures is not lessened, but rather\nincreased, by the coexistent happiness of others in the same object.",
        "There is one other aspect of the artistic impulse which is of peculiar\nimportance to the student of poetry. It is this: the impulse toward\nartistic creation always works along lines of order. The creative impulse\nmay remain a mystery in its essence, the play of blind instinct, as many\nphilosophers have supposed; a portion of the divine energy which is\nsomehow given to men. All sorts of men, good and bad, cultured and savage,\nhave now and again possessed this vital creative power. They have been\nable to say with Thomas Lovell Beddoes:",
        "  “I have a bit of fiat in my soul,\n  And can myself create my little world.”",
        "The little world which their imagination has created may be represented\nonly by a totem pole or a colored basket or a few scratches on a piece of\nbone; or it may be a temple or a symphony. But if it be anything more than\nthe mere whittling of a stick to exercise surplus energy, it is ordered\nplay or labor. It follows a method. It betrays  remeditation. It is the\nexpression of something in the mind. And even the mere whittler usually\nwhittles his stick to a point: that is, he is “making” something.\nHis knife, almost before he is aware of what he is doing, follows a\npattern–invented in his brain on the instant or remembered from other\npatterns. He gets pleasure from the sheer muscular activity, and from\nhis tactile sense of the bronze or steel as it penetrates the softer wood.\nBut he gets a higher pleasure still from his pattern, from his sense of\nmaking something, no matter how idly. And as soon as the pattern or\npurpose or “design” is recognized by others the maker’s pleasure is\nheightened, sharable. For he has accomplished the miracle: he has thrown\nthe raw material of feeling into form–and that form itself yields\npleasure. His “bit of fiat” has taken a piece of wood and transformed it:\nmade it expressive of something. All the “arts of design” among primitive\nraces show this pattern-instinct.",
        "But the impulse toward an ordered expression of feeling is equally\napparent in the rudimentary stages of music and poetry. The striking of\nhands or feet in unison, the rhythmic shout of many voices, the regular\nbeat of the tom-tom, the excited spectators of a college athletic contest\nas they break spontaneously from individual shouting into waves of\ncheering and of song, the quickened feet of negro stevedores as some one\nstarts a tune, the children’s delight in joining hands and moving in a\ncircle, all serve to illustrate the law that as feeling gains in intensity\nit tends toward ordered expression. Poetry, said Coleridge, in one of his\nmarvelous moments of insight, is the result of “a more than usual state of\nemotion” combined “with more than usual order.”",
        "What has been said about play and sharable pleasure and the beginning of\ndesign has been well summarized by Sidney Colvin:\n[Footnote: Article on “The Fine Arts” in Encyclopaedia Britannica.]",
        "“There are some things which we do because we must; these are our\nnecessities. There are other things which we do because we ought; these\nare our duties. There are other things which we do because we like; these\nare our play. Among the various kinds of things done by men only because\nthey like, the fine arts are those of which the results afford to many\npermanent and disinterested delight, and of which the performance, calling\nfor premeditated skill, is capable of regulation up to a certain point,\nbut that point passed, has secrets beyond the reach and a freedom beyond\nthe restraint of rules.”",
        "3. “Form” and “Significance” in the Arts\nIf the fine arts, then, deal with the ordered or harmonious expression of\nfeeling, it is clear that any specific work of art may be regarded, at\nleast theoretically, from two points of view. We may look at its “outside\"\nor its “inside\"; that is to say at its ordering of parts, its pattern, its\n\"form,” or else at the feeling or idea which it conveys. This distinction\nbetween form and content, between expression and that which is expressed,\nis temptingly convenient. It is a useful tool of analysis, but it is\ndangerous to try to make it anything more than that. If we were looking at\na water-pipe and the water which flows through it, it would be easy to\nkeep a clear distinction between the form of the iron pipe, and its\ncontent of water. But in certain of the fine arts very noticeably, such as\nmusic, and in a diminished degree, poetry, and more or less in all of\nthem, the form is the expression or content. A clear-cut dissection of the\ncomponent elements of outside and inside, of water-pipe and water within\nit, becomes impossible. Listening to music is like looking at a brook;\nthere is no inside and outside, it is all one intricately blended complex\nof sensation. Music is a perfect example of “embodied feeling,” as\nstudents of aesthetics term it, and the body is here inseparable from the\nfeeling. But in poetry, which is likewise embodied feeling, it is somewhat\neasier to attempt, for purposes of logical analysis, a separation of the\ncomponent elements of thought (i.e. “content”) and form. We speak\nconstantly of the “idea” of a poem as being more or less adequately\n\"expressed,” that is, rendered in terms of form. The actual form of a\ngiven lyric may or may not be suited to its mood,\n[Footnote: Certainly not, for instance, in Wordsworth’s “Reverie of Poor\nSusan.\"]\nor the poet may not have been a sufficiently skilful workman to achieve\nsuccess in the form or “pattern” which he has rightly chosen.",
        "Even in poetry, then, the distinction between inside and outside,\ncontent and form, has sometimes its value, and in other arts, like\npainting and sculpture, it often becomes highly interesting and\ninstructive to attempt the separation of the two elements. The French\npainter Millet, for instance, is said to have remarked to a pupil who\nshowed him a well-executed sketch: “You can paint. But what have you to\nsay?” The pupil’s work had in Millet’s eyes no “significance.” The English\npainter G. F. Watts often expressed himself in the same fashion: “I paint\nfirst of all because I have something to say.... My intention has not been\nso much to paint pictures that will charm the eye as to suggest great\nthoughts that will appeal to the imagination and the heart and kindle all\nthat is best and noblest in humanity.... My work is a protest against the\nmodern opinion that Art should have nothing to say intellectually.”",
        "On the other hand, many distinguished artists and critics have given\nassent to what has been called the “Persian carpet” theory of painting.\nAccording to them a picture should be judged precisely as one judges a\nPersian rug–by the perfection of its formal beauty, its harmonies of\nline, color and texture, its “unity in variety.” It is evident that the\nmen who hold this opinion are emphasizing form in the work of art, and\nthat Millet and Watts emphasized significance. One school is thinking\nprimarily of expression, and the other of that which is expressed. The\nimportant point for the student of poetry to grasp is that this divergence\nof opinion turns upon the question of relative emphasis. Even pure form,\nor “a-priori form” as it has sometimes been called,–such as a\nrectangle, a square, a cube,–carries a certain element of association\nwhich gives it a degree of significance. There is no absolutely bare or\nblank pattern. “Four-square” means something to the mind, because it is\nintimately connected with our experience.\n[Footnote: See Bosanquet, Three Lectures on Aesthetic, pp. 19, 29, 39,\nand Santayana, The Sense of Beauty, p. 83.]\nIt cannot be a mere question of balance, parallelism and abstract “unity\nin variety.” The acanthus design in architectural ornament, the Saracenic\ndecoration on a sword-blade, aim indeed primarily at formal beauty and\nlittle more. The Chinese laundryman hands you a red slip of paper covered\nwith strokes of black ink in strange characters. It is undecipherable to\nyou, yet it possesses in its sheer charm of color and line, something of\nbeauty, and the freedom and vigor of the strokes are expressive of\nvitality. It is impossible that Maud’s face should really have been",
        "  “Faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly null,\n   Dead perfection, no more.”",
        "Nevertheless, though absolutely pure decorative beauty does not exist, the\nartist may push the decorative principle very far, so far, indeed, that\nhis product lacks interest and proves tedious or nonsensical. There is\n\"nonsense-verse,” as we shall see later, which fulfills every condition\nfor pure formal beauty in poetry. Yet it is not poetry, but only\nnonsense-verse.",
        "Now shift the interest from the form to the meaning contained in the work\nof art, that is, to its significance. An expressive face is one that\nreveals character. Its lines are suggestive of something. They are\nassociated, like the lines of purely decorative beauty, with more or less\nobscure tracts of our experience, but they arouse a keen mental interest.\nThey stimulate, they are packed closely with meaning, with fact, with\nrepresentative quality. The same thing is true of certain landscapes.\nWitness Thomas Hardy’s famous description of Egdon Heath in The Return of\nthe Native. It is true of music. Certain modern music almost breaks down,\nas music, under the weight of meaning, of fact, of thought, which the\ncomposer has striven to make it carry.",
        "There is no question that the principle of significance may be pushed too\nfar, just as the principle of decorative or purely formal beauty may be\nemphasized too exclusively. But is there any real antagonism between the\nelements of form and significance, beauty and expressiveness? This\nquestion has been debated ever since the time of Winckelmann and Lessing.\nThe controversy over the work of such artists as Wagner, Browning,\nWhitman, Rodin has turned largely upon it.",
        "Browning himself strove to cut the difficult aesthetic knot with a rough\nstroke of common sense:",
        "                            “Is it so pretty\n  You can’t discover if it means hope, fear,\n  Sorrow or joy? Won’t beauty go with these?\"\n[Footnote: “Fra Lippo Lippi.\"]",
        "He tried again in the well-known passage from The Ring and the Book:",
        "  “So may you paint your picture, twice show truth,\n   Beyond mere imagery on the wall,–\n   So note by note bring music from your mind\n   Deeper than ever e’en Beethoven dived,–\n   So write a book shall mean beyond the facts,\n   Suffice the eye and save the soul beside.”",
        "How Whistler, the author of Ten O’Clock and the creator of exquisitely\nlovely things, must have loathed that final line! But Bosanquet’s\ncarefully framed definition of the beautiful, in his History of\nAesthetic, endeavors, like Browning, to adjust the different claims of\nform and significance: “The beautiful is that which has characteristic or\nindividual expressiveness for sense-perception or imagination, subject to\nthe conditions of general or abstract expressiveness in the same medium.\"\nThat is to say, in less philosophical language, that as long as you\nobserve the laws of formal beauty which belong to the medium in which you\nare working, you may be as expressive or significant as you like. But the\nartist must be obedient to the terms of his chosen medium of expression;\nif he is composing music or poetry he must not break the general laws of\nmusic or poetry in order to attempt that valiant enterprise of saving a\nsoul.",
        "4. The Man in the Work of Art\nThough there is much in this matter of content and form which is baffling\nto the student of general aesthetic theory, there is at least one aspect\nof the question which the student of poetry must grasp clearly. It is\nthis: there is nothing in any work of art except what some man has put\nthere. What he has put in is our content question; what shape he has\nput it into is our form question. In Bosanquet’s more technical language:\n\"A man is the middle term between content and expression.” There is\ndoubtless some element of mystery in what we call creative power, but this\nis a part of man’s mystery. There is no mystery in the artist’s material\nas such: he is working in pigments or clay or vibrating sound or whatever\nother medium he has chosen. The qualities and possibilities of this\nparticular medium fascinate him, preoccupy him. He comes, as we say, to\nthink in terms of color or line or sound. He learns or may learn in time,\nas Whistler bade him, “never to push a medium further than it will go.\"\nThe chief value of Lessing’s epoch-making discussion of “time-arts” and\n\"space-arts” in his Laokoon consisted in the emphasis laid upon the\nspecific material of the different arts, and hence upon the varying\nopportunities which one medium or another affords to the artist. But\nthough human curiosity never wearies of examining the inexhaustible\npossibilities of this or that material, it is chiefly concerned, after\nall, in the use of material as it has been moulded by the fingers and the\nbrain of a particular artist. The material becomes transformed as it\npasses through his “shop,” in some such way as iron is transformed into\nsteel in a blast furnace. An apparatus called a “transformer\" alters the\nwave-length of an electrical current and reduces high pressure to low\npressure, or the reverse. The brain of the artist seems to function in a\nsomewhat similar manner as it reshapes the material furnished it by the\nsenses, and expresses it in new forms. Poetry furnishes striking\nillustrations of the transformations wrought in the crucible of the\nimagination, and we must look at these in detail in a subsequent chapter.\nBut it may be helpful here to quote the testimony of two or three artists\nand then to examine the psychological basis of this central function of\nthe artist’s mind.",
        "“Painting is the expression of certain sensations,” said Carolus Duran.\n\"You should not seek merely to copy the model that is posed before you,\nbut rather to take into account the impression that is made upon the\nmind.... Take careful account of the substances that you must\nrender–wood, metal, textures, for instance. When you fail to reproduce\nnature as you feel it, then you falsify it. Painting is not done with\nthe eyes, but with the brain.”",
        "W. W. Story, the sculptor, wrote: “Art is art because it is not nature....\nThe most perfect imitation of nature is therefore not art. It must pass\nthrough the mind of the artist and be changed. Art is nature reflected\nthrough the spiritual mirror, and tinged with all the sentiment, feeling,\npassion of the spirit that reflects it.”",
        "In John La Farge’s Considerations on Painting, a little book which is\nfull of suggestiveness to the student of literature, there are many\npassages illustrating the conception of art as “the representation of the\nartist’s view of the world.” La Farge points out that “drawing from life\nis an exercise of memory. It might be said that the sight of the moment is\nmerely a theme upon which we embroider the memories of former likings,\nformer aspirations, former habits, images that we have cared for, and\nthrough which we indicate to others our training, our race, the entire\neducated part of our nature.”",
        "One of La Farge’s concrete examples must be quoted at length:\n[Footnote: Considerations on Painting, pp. 71-73. Macmillan.]",
        "  “I remember myself, years ago, sketching with two well-known men,\n  artists who were great friends, great cronies, asking each other all\n  the time, how to do this and how to do that; but absolutely\n  different in the texture of their minds and in the result that they\n  wished to obtain, so far as the pictures and drawings by which they\n  were well known to the public are concerned.",
        "  “What we made, or rather, I should say, what we wished to note, was\n  merely a memorandum of a passing effect upon the hills that lay\n  before us. We had no idea of expressing ourselves, or of studying in\n  any way the subject for any future use. We merely had the intention\n  to note this affair rapidly, and we had all used the same words to\n  express to each other what we liked in it. There were big clouds\n  rolling over hills, sky clearing above, dots of trees and water and\n  meadow-land below us, and the ground fell away suddenly before us.\n  Well, our three sketches were, in the first place, different in\n  shape; either from our physical differences, or from a habit of\n  drawing certain shapes of a picture, which itself usually\n  indicates–as you know, or ought to know–whether we are looking far\n  or near. Two were oblong, but of different proportions; one was more\n  nearly a square; the distance taken in to the right and left was\n  smaller in the latter case, and, on the contrary, the height up and\n  down–that is to say, the portion of land beneath and the portion of\n  sky above–was greater. In each picture the clouds were treated with\n  different precision and different attention. In one picture the open\n  sky above was the main intention of the picture. In two pictures the\n  upper sky was of no consequence–it was the clouds and the mountains\n  that were insisted upon. The drawing was the same, that is to say,\n  the general make of things; but each man had involuntarily looked\n  upon what was most interesting to him in the whole sight; and though\n  the whole sight was what he meant to represent, he had unconsciously\n  preferred a beauty or an interest of things different from what his\n  neighbour liked.",
        "  “The colour of each painting was different–the vivacity of colour\n  and tone, the distinctness of each part in relation to the whole;\n  and each picture would have been recognized anywhere as a specimen\n  of work by each one of us, characteristic of our names. And we spent\n  on the whole affair perhaps twenty minutes.",
        "  “I wish you to understand, again, that we each thought and felt as if\n  we had been photographing the matter before us. We had not the first\n  desire of expressing ourselves, and I think would have been very\n  much worried had we not felt that each one was true to nature. And\n  we were each one true to nature.... If you ever know how to paint\n  somewhat well, and pass beyond the position of the student who has\n  not yet learned to use his hands as an expression of the memories of\n  his brain, you will always give to nature, that is to say, what is\n  outside of you, the character of the lens through which you see\n  it–which is yourself.”",
        "Such bits of testimony from painters help us to understand the brief\nsayings of the critics, like Taine’s well-known “Art is nature seen\nthrough a temperament,” G. L. Raymond’s “Art is nature made human,” and\nCroce’s “Art is the expression of impressions.” These painters and critics\nagree, evidently, that the mind of the artist is an organism which acts as\na “transformer.” It receives the reports of the senses, but alters these\nreports in transmission and it is precisely in this alteration that the\nmost personal and essential function of the  artist’s brain is to be\nfound.",
        "Remembering this, let the student of poetry now recall the diagram used in\nhandbooks of psychology to illustrate the process of sensory stimulus of a\nnerve-centre and the succeeding motor reaction. The diagram is usually\ndrawn after this fashion:",
        "Sensory stimulus           Nerve-centre          Motor Reaction",
        "The process is thus described by William James:\n[Footnote: Psychology, Briefer Course, American Science Series, p. 91.\nHenry Holt.]",
        "  “The afferent nerves, when excited by some physical irritant, be this as\n  gross in its mode of operation as a chopping axe or as subtle as the\n  waves of light, convey the excitement to the nervous centres. The\n  commotion set up in the centres does not stop there, but discharges\n  through the efferent nerves, exciting movements which vary with the\n  animal and with the irritant applied.”",
        "The familiar laboratory experiment irritates with a drop of acid the hind\nleg of a frog. Even if the frog’s brain has been removed, leaving the\nspinal cord alone to represent the nervous system, the stimulus of the\nacid results in an instant movement of the leg. Sensory stimulus,\nconsequent excitement of the nerve centre and then motor reaction is the\nlaw. Thus an alarmed cuttlefish secretes an inky fluid which colors the\nsea-water and serves as his protection. Such illustrations may be\nmultiplied indefinitely.\n[Footnote: See the extremely interesting statement by Sara Teasdale,\nquoted in Miss Wilkinson’s New Voices, p. 199. Macmillan, 1919.]\nIt may seem fanciful to insist upon the analogy between a frightened\ncuttlefish squirting ink into sea-water and an agitated poet spreading ink\nupon paper, but in both cases, as I have said elsewhere, “it is a question\nof an organism, a stimulus and a reaction. The image of the solitary\nreaper stirs a Wordsworth, and the result is a poem; a profound sorrow\ncomes to Alfred Tennyson, and he produces In Memoriam.\"\n[Footnote: Counsel upon the Reading of Books, p. 219. Houghton Mifflin\nCompany.]",
        "In the next chapter we must examine this process with more detail. But the\nperson who asks himself how poetry comes into being will find a\npreliminary answer by reflecting upon the relation of “impression” to\n\"expression” in every nerve-organism, and in all the arts. Everywhere he\nmust reckon with this ceaseless current of impressions, “the stream of\nconsciousness,” sweeping inward to the brain; everywhere he will detect\nmodification, selections, alterations in the stream as it passes through\nthe higher nervous centres; everywhere he will find these transformed\n\"impressions” expressed in the terms of some specific medium. Thus the\ntemple of Karnak expresses in huge blocks of stone an imagination which\nhas brooded over the idea of the divine permanence. The Greek\n\"discus-thrower” is the idealized embodiment of a typical kind of athlete,\na conception resulting from countless visual and tactile sensations. An\nAmerican millionaire buys a “Corot” or a “Monet,” that is to say, a piece\nof colored canvas upon which a highly individualized artistic temperament\nhas recorded its vision or impression of some aspect of the world as it\nhas been interpreted by Corot’s or Monet’s eye and brain and hand. A\ncertain stimulus or “impression,” an organism which reshapes impressions,\nand then an “expression” of these transformed impressions into the terms\npermitted by some specific material: that is the threefold process which\nseems to be valid in all of the fine arts. It is nowhere more intricately\nfascinating than in poetry.",
        "THE PROVINCE OF POETRY",
        "    “The more I read and re-read the works of the great poets,\n    and the more I study the writings of those who have some\n    Theory of Poetry to set forth, the more am I convinced that\n    the question What is Poetry? can be properly answered only if\n    we make What it does take precedence of How it does it.\"\n        J. A. STEWART, The Myths of Plato",
        "In the previous chapter we have attempted a brief survey of some of the\ngeneral aesthetic questions which arise whenever we consider the form and\nmeaning of the fine arts. We must now try to look more narrowly at the\nspecial field of poetry, asking ourselves how it comes into being, what\nmaterial it employs, and how it uses this material to secure those\nspecific effects which we all agree in calling “poetical,” however widely\nwe may differ from one another in our analysis of the means by which the\neffect is produced.",
        "Let us begin with a truism. It is universally admitted that poetry, like\neach of the fine arts, has a field of its own. To run a surveyor’s\nline accurately around the borders of this field, determining what belongs\nto it rather than to the neighboring arts, is always difficult and\nsometimes impossible. But the field itself is admittedly “there,” in all\nits richness and beauty, however bitterly the surveyors may quarrel about\nthe boundary lines. (It is well to remember that professional surveyors do\nnot themselves own these fields or raise any crops upon them!) How much\nmap-making ingenuity has been devoted to this task of grouping and\nclassifying the arts: distinguishing between art and fine art, between\nartist, artificer and artisan; seeking to arrange a hierarchy of the arts\non the basis of their relative freedom from fixed ends, their relative\ncomplexity or comprehensiveness of effect, their relative obligation to\nimitate or represent something that exists in nature! No one cares\nparticularly to-day about such matters of precedence–as if the arts were\nwalking in a carefully ordered ecclesiastical procession. On the other\nhand, there is ever-increasing recognition of the soundness of the\ndistinction made by Lessing in his Laokoon: or the Limits of Painting and\nPoetry; namely, that the fine arts differ, as media of expression,\naccording to the nature of the material which they employ. That is to say,\nthe “time-arts\"–like poetry and music–deal primarily with actions that\nsucceed one another in time. The space-arts–painting, sculpture,\narchitecture–deal primarily with bodies that coexist in space. Hence\nthere are some subjects that belong naturally in the “painting” group, and\nothers that belong as naturally in the “poetry” group. The artist should\nnot “confuse the genres,” or, to quote Whistler again, he should not push\na medium further than it will go. Recent psychology has more or less upset\nLessing’s technical theory of vision,\n[Footnote: F. E. Bryant, The Limits of Descriptive Writing, etc. Ann\nArbor, 1906.]\nbut it has confirmed the value of his main contention as to the fields\nof the various arts.",
        "1. The Myth of Orpheus and Eurydice\nAn illustration will make this matter clear. Let us take the Greek myth of\nOrpheus and Eurydice, which has been utilized by many artists during more\nthan two thousand years assuredly, and how much longer no one knows.\nVirgil told it in the Georgics and Ovid in the Metamorphoses. It\nbecame a favorite theme of medieval romance, and whether told in a French\nlai or Scottish ballad like “King Orfeo,” it still keeps, among all the\nstrange transformations which it has undergone, “the freshness of the\nearly world.” Let us condense the story from King Alfred’s Anglo-Saxon\nversion of Boethius’s De Consolatione Philosophiae: “There was once a\nfamous Thracian harper named Orpheus who had a beautiful wife named\nEurydice. She died and went to hell. Orpheus longed sorrowfully for her,\nharping so sweetly that the very woods and wild beasts listened to his\nwoe. Finally, he resolved to seek her in hell and win her back by his\nskill. And he played so marvelously there that the King of Hell to reward\nhim gave him back his wife again, only upon the condition that he should\nnot turn back to look at her as he led her forth. But, alas, who can\nconstrain love? When Orpheus came to the boundary of darkness and light,\nhe turned round to see if his wife was following–and she vanished.”",
        "Such was the myth in one of its manifold European forms. It deals\nobviously with a succession of events, with actions easily narratable by\nmeans of a “time-art” like poetry. The myth itself is one of fascinating\nhuman interest, and if a prose writer like Hawthorne had chosen to tell it\nin his Wonder-Book, we should doubtless speak of it as a “poetic” story.\nWe should mean, in using that adjective, that the myth contained\nsentiment, imagination, passion, dramatic climax, pathos–the qualities\nwhich we commonly associate with poetry–and that Hawthorne, although a\nprose writer, had such an exquisite sympathy for Greek stories that his\nhandling of the material would be as delicate, and the result possibly as\nlovely, as if the tale had been told in verse. But if we would realize the\nfull value of Lessing’s distinction, we must turn to one of the countless\nverse renderings of the myth. Here we have a succession of actions,\nindeed, quite corresponding to those of the prose story. But these images\nof action, succeeding one another in time, are now evoked by successive\nmusical sounds,–the sounds being, as in prose, arbitrary word-symbols of\nimage and idea,–only that in poetry the sounds have a certain ordered\narrangement which heightens the emotional effect of the images evoked.\nProse writer and poet might mean to tell precisely the same tale, but in\nreality they cannot, for one is composing, no matter how cunningly, in the\ntunes of prose and the other in the tunes of verse. The change in the\ninstrument means an alteration in the mental effect.",
        "Now turn to Lessing’s other exemplar of the time-arts, the musician–for\nmusicians as well as poets, painters and sculptors have utilized the myth\nof Orpheus and Eurydice. What can the musician do with the theme? Gluck’s\nopera may serve for answer. He cannot, by the aid of music alone, call up\nvery definite ideas or images. He cannot tell the Orpheus story clearly to\none who has never heard it. But to one who already knows the tale, a\ncomposer’s overture–without stage accessories or singing actors or any\n\"operatic” devices as such–furnishes in its successions and combinations\nof musical sound, without the use of verbal symbols, a unique pleasurable\nemotion which strongly and powerfully reinforces the emotions suggested by\nthe Orpheus myth itself. Certain portions of the story, such as those\nrelating to the wondrous harping, can obviously be interpreted better\nthrough music than through the medium of any other art.",
        "What can Lessing’s “space-arts,” sculpture and painting, do with the\nmaterial furnished by the Orpheus myth? It is clear that they cannot tell\nthe whole story, since they are dealing with “bodies that coexist” rather\nthan with successive actions. They must select some one instant of action\nonly, and preferably the most significant moment of the whole, the parting\nof husband and wife. In the museum at Naples there is the wonderful Greek\ntreatment of this theme, in sculptured high relief. The sculptor has\nchosen the moment of parting. Hermes, the messenger of the gods to recall\nEurydice, has twined his hand gently around the left hand of the woman.\nWith her right hand she still touches her husband, but the dread instant\nis upon them all. The sculptor, representing the persons in three\ndimensions, as far as high relief allows, has sufficiently\ncharacterized their faces and figures, and with exquisite sense of rhythm\nand balance in his composition has fulfilled every requirement of formal\nbeauty that marble affords.",
        "In Sir Frederick Leighton’s painting of Orpheus and Eurydice and in many\nanother less famous painter’s rendering of the theme, there is likewise\nthe portrayal of an arrested moment. But the painter represents the\npersonages and the background in two dimensions. He can separate his\nfigures more completely than the sculptor, can make their instant of\naction more “dramatic,” can portray certain objects, such as the\ndiaphanous robe of Eurydice as she vanishes into mist, which are beyond\nthe power of the sculptor to represent, and above all he can suggest the\ncolor of the objects themselves, the degree of light and shade, the\n\"atmosphere” of the whole, in a fashion unapproachable by the rival arts.",
        "The illustration need not be worked out more elaborately here, though the\nstudent may profitably reflect upon the resources of the modern moving\npicture–which is a novel combination of the “time” and “space” arts–and\nof the mimetic dance, as affording still further opportunities for\nexpressing the artistic possibilities of the Orpheus story. But the chief\nlesson to be learned by one who is attempting in this way to survey the\nprovinces of the different arts is this: no two of all the artists who\nhave availed themselves of the Orpheus material have really had the same\nsubject, although the title of each of their productions, if catalogued,\nmight conveniently be called “Orpheus and Eurydice.” Each has had his own\nconception of the theme, each his own professional technique in handling\nhis chosen medium, each his own habits of brain, each, in a word, has\nfound his own subject. “Are these children who are playing in the\nsunlight,” said Fromentin, “or is it a place in the sunlight in\nwhich children are playing?” One is a “figure” subject, that is to say,\nwhile the other is a landscape subject.",
        "The whole topic of the “provinces” of the arts becomes hopelessly academic\nand sterile if one fails to keep his eye upon the individual artist, whose\nfree choice of a subject is conditioned solely by his own artistic\ninterest in rendering such aspects of any theme as his own medium of\nexpression will allow him to represent. Take one of the most beautiful\nobjects in nature, a quiet sea. Is this a “painter-like” subject?\nAssuredly, yet the etcher has often rendered the effect of a quiet sea in\nterms of line, as a pastellist has rendered it in terms of color, and a\nmusician in terms of tone-feeling, and a poet in terms of tone-feeling\nplus thought. Each one of them finds something for himself, selects\nhis own “subject,” from the material presented by the quiet sea, and\nwhatever he may find belongs to him. We declaim against the confusion of\nthe genres, the attempt to render in the terms of one art what belongs, as\nwe had supposed, to another art, and we are often right in our protest.\nYet artists have always been jumping each other’s claims, and the sole\ntest of the lawfulness of the procedure is the success of the result. If\nthe border-foray of the impressionist or imagist proves successful, well\nand good, but a triumphant raid should not be mistaken for the steady\nlines of the main campaign.",
        "2. The Special Field\nWhat then do we mean by the province of poetry? Simply that there is a\nspecial field in which, for uncounted centuries, poets have produced a\ncertain kind of artistic effect. Strictly speaking, it is better to say\n\"poets” rather than “the poet,” just as William James confesses that\nstrictly speaking there is no such thing as “the Imagination,” there are\nonly imaginations. But “the poet” is a convenient expression to indicate a\nman functioning qua poet–i.e. a man poetizing; and we shall continue to\nuse it. When we say that “the poet” in Sir Walter Scott inspires this or\nthat utterance, while “the novelist” or “the historian” or “the critic” in\nhim has prompted this or that other utterance, we are within our rights.",
        "The field of poetry, as commonly understood, is that portion of human\nfeeling which expresses itself through rhythmical and preferably metrical\nlanguage. In this field “the poet” labors. The human feeling which he\nembodies in verse comes to him originally, as feeling comes to all men, in\nconnection with a series of mental images. These visual, auditory, motor\nor tactile images crowd the stream of consciousness as it sweeps inward to\nthe brain. There the images are subjected to a process of selection,\nmodification, transformation.\n[Footnote: “The finest poetry was first experience; but the thought\nhas suffered a transformation since it was an experience.” Emerson,\nShakespeare: The Poet.]\nAt some point in the process the poet’s images tend to become verbal,–as\nthe painter’s or the musician’s do not,–and these verbal images are then\ndischarged in rhythmical patterns. It is one type of the threefold process\nroughly described at the close of Chapter I. What is peculiar to the poet\nas compared with other men or other artists is to be traced not so much in\nthe peculiar nature of his visual, auditory, motor or tactile images–for\nin this respect poets differ enormously among one another–as in the\nincreasingly verbal form of these images as they are reshaped by his\nimagination, and in the strongly rhythmical or metrical character of the\nfinal expression.",
        "Let carbon represent the first of the stages, the excited feeling\nresulting from sensory stimulus. That is the raw material of poetic\nemotion. Let the diamond represent the second stage, the chemical change,\nas it were, produced in the mental images under the heat and pressure of\nthe imagination. The final stage would be represented by the cutting,\npolishing and setting of the diamond, by the arrangement of the\ntransformed and now purely verbal images into effective rhythmical or\nmetrical designs.",
        "Wordsworth once wrote of true poets who possessed",
        "  “The vision and the faculty divine,\n  Though wanting the accomplishment of verse.”",
        "Let us venture to apply Wordsworth’s terminology to the process already\ndescribed. The “vision” of the poet would mean his sense-impressions of\nevery kind, his experience, as Goethe said, of “the outer world, the inner\nworld and the other world.” The “faculty divine,” into which vision blends\ninsensibly, would mean the mysterious change of these sense-impressions–\nas they become subjected to reflection, comparison, memory, “passion\nrecollected in tranquillity,\"–into words possessing a peculiar life and\npower. The “accomplishment of verse” is easier to understand. It is the\nexpression, by means of these words now pulsating with rhythm–the natural\nlanguage of excitement–of whatever the poet has seen and felt, modified\nby his imagination. The result is a poem: “embodied feeling.”",
        "Browning says to his imaginary poet:",
        "  “Your brains beat into rhythm–you tell\n               What we felt only.”",
        "There is much virtue, for us, in this rudely vigorous description of “the\npoet.” Certainly all of us feel, and thus far we are all potential poets.\nBut according to Browning there is, so to speak, a physiological\ndifference between the poet’s brain and ours. His brain beats into rhythm;\nthat is the simple but enormous difference in function, and hence it is\nthat he can tell what we only feel. That is, he becomes a “singer” as well\nas “maker,” while we, conscious though we may be of the capacity for\nintense feeling, cannot embody our feelings in the forms of verse. We may\nindeed go so far as to reshape mental images in our heated brains–for all\nmen do this under excitement, but to sing what we have thus made is denied\nto us.",
        "3. An Illustration from William James\nNo one can be more conscious than the present writer of the impossibility\nof describing in plain prose the admittedly complicated and mysterious\nseries of changes by which poetry comes into being. Those readers who find\nthat even the lines just quoted from Wordsworth and Browning throw little\nnew light upon the old difficulties, may nevertheless get a bit of help\nhere by turning back to William James’s diagram of the working of the\nbrain. It will be remembered that in Chapter I we used the simplest\npossible chart to represent the sensory stimulus of a nerve-centre and the\nsucceeding motor reaction, and we compared the “in-coming” and “out-going\"\nnerve processes with the function of Impression and Expression in the\narts. But to understand something of what takes place in the making of\npoetry we must now substitute for our first diagram the slightly more\ncomplicated one which William James employs to represent, not those lower\nnerve-centres which “act from present sensational stimuli alone,” but the\nhemispheres of the human brain which “act from considerations.\"\n[Footnote: Psychology, Briefer Course, pp. 97, 98. Henry Holt.]\nConsiderations are images constructed out of past experience, they are\nreproductions of what has been felt or witnessed.",
        "  “They are, in short, remote sensations; and the main difference\n  between the hemisphereless animal and the whole one may be concisely\n  expressed by saying that the one obeys absent, the other only present,\n  objects. The hemispheres would then seem to be the chief seat of\n  memory.“",
        "Then follows the accompanying diagram and illustration.",
        "  “If we liken the nervous currents to electric currents, we can compare\n  the nervous system, C, below the hemispheres to a direct circuit from\n  sense-organ to muscle along the line S... C... M. The hemisphere, H,\n  adds the long circuit or loop-line through which the current may pass\n  when for any reason the direct line is not used.",
        "[Illustration: M ?––- C ?––- H ?––- C ?–– S ]",
        "  “Thus, a tired wayfarer on a hot day throws himself on the damp earth\n  beneath a maple-tree. The sensations of delicious rest and coolness\n  pouring themselves through the direct line would naturally discharge\n  into the muscles of complete extension: he would abandon himself to the\n  dangerous repose. But the loop-line being open, part of the current is\n  drafted along it, and awakens rheumatic or catarrhal reminiscences,\n  which prevail over the instigations of sense, and make the man arise and\n  pursue his way to where he may enjoy his rest more safely.”",
        "William James’s entire discussion of the value of the hemisphere\n\"loop-line” as a reservoir of reminiscences is of peculiar suggestiveness\nto the student of poetry. For it is along this loop-line of “memories and\nideas of the distant” that poetry wins its generalizing or universalizing\npower. It is here that the life of reason enters into the life of mere\nsensation, transforming the reports of the nerves into ideas and thoughts\nthat have coherence and general human significance. It is possible,\ncertainly, as the experiments of contemporary “imagists” prove, to write\npoetry of a certain type without employing the “loop-line.” But this is\npure sensorium verse, the report of retinal, auditory or tactile images,\nand nothing more. “Response to impressions and representation of those\nimpressions in their original isolation are the marks of the new poetry.\nResponse to impressions, correlation of those impressions into a\nconnected body of phenomena, and final interpretation of them as a whole\nare, have been, and always will be the marks of the enduring in all\nliterature, whether poetry or prose.\"\n[Footnote: Lewis Worthington Smith, “The New Naiveté,” Atlantic, April,\n1916.]\nTo quote another critic: “A rock, a star, a lyre, a cataract, do not,\nexcept incidentally and indirectly, owe their command of our sympathies to\nthe bare power of evoking reactions in a series of ocular envelopes or\nauditory canals. Their power lies in their freightage of association,\nin their tactical position at the focus of converging experience, in\nthe number and vigor of the occasions in which they have crossed and\nre-crossed the palpitating thoroughfares of life. ... Sense-impressions\nare poetically valuable only in the measure of their power to procreate or\nre-create experience.\"\n[Footnote: O. W. Firkins, “The New Movement in Poetry,” Nation, October\n14, 1915.]",
        "One may give the fullest recognition to the delicacy and sincerity of\nimagist verse, to its magical skill in seeming to open new doors of sense\nexperience by merely shutting the old doors of memory, to its naive\ncourage in rediscovering the formula of “Back to Nature.\"\n[Footnote: See the discussion of imagist verse in chap. III.]\nLike “free verse,” it has widened the field of expression, although its\nadvocates have sometimes forgotten that thousands of “imagist” poems lie\nembedded in the verse of Browning and even in the prose of George\nMeredith.\n[Footnote: J. L. Lowes, “An Unacknowledged Imagist,” Nation, February\n24, 1916.]\nWe shall discuss some of its tenets later, but it should be noted at this\npoint that the radical deficiency of imagist verse, as such, is in its\nlack of general ideas. Much of it might have been written by an infinitely\nsensitive decapitated frog. It is “hemisphereless” poetry.",
        "4. The Poet and Other Men\nThe mere physical vision of the poet may or may not be any keener than the\nvision of other men. There is an infinite variety in the bodily endowments\nof habitual verse-makers: there have been near-sighted poets like\nTennyson, far-sighted poets like Wordsworth, and, in the well-known\ncase of Robert Browning, a poet conveniently far-sighted in one eye and\nnear-sighted in the other! No doubt the life-long practice of observing\nand recording natural phenomena sharpens the sense of poets, as it does\nthe senses of Indians, naturalists, sailors and all outdoors men. The\nquick eye for costume and character possessed by a Chaucer or a Shakspere\nis remarkable, but equally so is the observation of a Dickens or a Balzac.\nIt is rather in what we call psychical vision that the poet is wont to\nexcel, that is, in his ability to perceive the meaning of visual\nphenomena. Here he ceases to be a mere reporter of retinal images, and\ntakes upon himself the higher and harder function of an interpreter of the\nvisible world. He has no immunity from the universal human experiences: he\nloves and he is angry and he sees men born and die. He becomes according\nto the measure of his intellectual capacity a thinker. He strives to see\ninto the human heart, to comprehend the working of the human mind. He\nreads the divine justice in the tragic fall of Kings. He penetrates\nbeneath the external forms of Nature and perceives her as a “living\npresence.” Yet the faculty of vision which the poet possesses in so\neminent a degree is shared by many who are not poets. Darwin’s outward eye\nwas as keen as Wordsworth’s; St. Paul’s sense of the reality of the\ninvisible world is more wonderful than Shakspere’s. The poet is indeed\nfirst of all a seer, but he must be something more than a seer before he\nis wholly poet.",
        "Another mark of the poetic mind is its vivid sense of relations. The part\nsuggests the whole. In the single instance there is a hint of the general\nlaw. The self-same Power that brings the fresh rhodora to the woods brings\nthe poet there also. In the field-mouse, the daisy, the water-fowl, he\nbeholds types and symbols. His own experience stands for all men’s. The\nconscience-stricken Macbeth is a poet when he cries, “Life is a walking\nshadow,” and King Lear makes the same pathetic generalization when he\nexclaims, “What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?” Through the\nshifting phenomena of the present the poet feels the sweep of the\nuniverse; his mimic play and “the great globe itself” are alike an\n\"insubstantial pageant,” though it may happen, as Tennyson said of\nWordsworth, that even in the transient he gives the sense of the\nabiding, “whose dwelling is the light of setting suns.”",
        "But this perception of relations, characteristic as it is of the poetic\ntemper, is also an attribute of the philosopher. The intellect of a\nNewton, too, leaps from the specific instance to the general law; every\nman, in proportion to his intelligence and insight, feels that the world\nis one; while Plato and Descartes play with the time and space world with\nall the grave sportiveness of Prospero.",
        "Again, the poets have always been the “genus irritabile\"–the irritable\ntribe. They not only see deeply, but feel acutely. Often they are too\nhighly sensitized for their own happiness. If they receive a pleasure more\nexquisite than ours from a flower, a glimpse of the sea, a gracious\naction, they are correspondingly quick to feel dissonances, imperfections,\nslights. Like Lamb, they are “rather squeamish about their women and\nchildren.” Like Keats, they are “snuffed out by an article.” Keener\npleasures, keener pains, this is the law of their life; but it is\napplicable to all persons of the so-called artistic temperament. It is one\nof the penalties of a fine organism. It does not of itself describe a\npoet.\n[Footnote: I have here utilized a few paragraphs from my chapter on\n\"Poetry” in Counsel upon the Reading of Books, Houghton Mifflin\nCompany.]",
        "The real difference between “the poet” and other men is rather to be\ntraced, as the present chapter has tried to indicate, in his capacity for\nmaking and employing verbal images of a certain kind, and combining these\nimages into rhythmical and metrical designs. In each of his functions–as\n\"seer,” as “maker,” and as “singer\"–he shows himself a true creator.\nCriticism no longer attempts to act as his “law-giver,” to assert what he\nmay or may not do. The poet is free, like every creative artist, to make a\nbeautiful object in any way he can. And nevertheless criticism–watching\ncountless poets lovingly for many a century, observing their various\nendowments, their manifest endeavors, their victories and defeats,\nobserving likewise the nature of language, that strange medium (so much\nstranger than any clay or bronze!) through which poets are compelled to\nexpress their conceptions–criticism believes that poetry, like\neach of the sister arts, has its natural province, its own field of the\nbeautiful. We have tried in this chapter to suggest the general direction\nof that field, without looking too narrowly for its precise boundaries. In\nW. H. Hudson’s Green Mansions the reader will remember how a few sticks\nand stones, laid upon a hilltop, were used as markers to indicate the\noutlines of a continent. Criticism, likewise, needs its poor sticks and\nstones of commonplace, if it is to point out any roadway. Our own road\nleads first into the difficult territory of the poet’s imaginings, and\nthen into the more familiar world of the poet’s words.",
        "THE POET’S IMAGINATION",
        "  “The essence of poetry is invention; such invention as, by producing\n  something unexpected, surprises and delights.\"\n    SAMUEL JOHNSON",
        "  “The singers do not beget, only the Poet begets.\"\n    WALT WHITMAN",
        "We must not at the outset insist too strongly upon the radical\ndistinction between “the poet\"–as we have called him for\nconvenience–and other men. The common sense of mankind asserts that this\ndistinction exists, yet it also asserts that all children are poets after\na certain fashion, and that the vast majority of adult persons are, at\nsome moment or other, susceptible to poetic feeling. A small girl, the\nother day, spoke of a telegraph wire as “that message-vine.” Her father\nand mother smiled at this naive renaming of the world of fact. It was a\nchild’s instinctive “poetizing” imagination, but the father and mother,\nwhile no longer capable, perhaps, of such daring verbal magic, were\nconscious that they had too often played with the world of fact, and, for\nthe instant at least, remoulded it into something nearer the heart’s\ndesire. That is to say, they could still feel “poetically,” though their\nwonderful chance of making up new names for everything had gone as soon as\nthe gates were shut upon the Paradise of childhood.",
        "All readers of poetry agree that it originates somehow in feeling, and\nthat if it be true poetry, it stimulates feeling in the hearer. And all\nreaders agree likewise that feeling is transmitted from the maker of\npoetry to the enjoyer of poetry by means of the imagination. But the\nmoment we pass beyond these accepted truisms, difficulties begin.",
        "1. Feeling and Imagination\nWhat is feeling, and exactly how is it bound up with the imagination? The\npsychology of feeling remains obscure, even after the labors of\ngenerations of specialists; and it is obvious that the general theories\nabout the nature of imagination have shifted greatly, even within the\nmemory of living men. Nevertheless there are some facts, in this\nconstantly contested territory, which now seem indisputable. One of them,\nand of peculiar significance to students of poetry, is this: in the stream\nof objects immediately present to consciousness there are no images of\nfeeling itself.\n[Footnote: This point has been elaborated with great care in Professor A.\nH. R. Fairchild’s Making of Poetry. Putnam’s, 1912.]",
        "“If I am asked to call up an image of a rose, of a tree, of a cloud, or of\na skylark, I can readily do it; but if I am asked to feel loneliness or\nsorrow, to feel hatred or jealousy, or to feel joy on the return of\nspring, I cannot readily do it. And the reason why I cannot do it is\nbecause I can call up no image of any one of these feelings. For\neverything I come to know through my senses, for everything in connection\nwith what I do or feel I can call up some kind of mental image; but for no\nkind of feeling itself can I ever possibly have a direct image. The only\neffective way of arousing any particular feeling that is more than mere\nbodily feeling is to call up the images that are naturally connected with\nthat feeling.\"\n[Footnote: Fairchild, pp. 24, 25.]",
        "If then, “the raw material of poetry,” as Professor Fairchild insists,\nis “the mental image,” we must try to see how these images are presented\nto the mind of the poet and in turn communicated to us. Instead of\nasserting, as our grandfathers did, that the imagination is a “faculty\"\nof the mind, like “judgment,” or accepting the theory of our fathers that\nimagination “is the whole mind thrown into the process of imagining,” the\npresent generation has been taught by psychologists like Charcot, James\nand Ribot that we are chiefly concerned with “imaginations,” that is, a\nseries of visual, auditory, motor or tactile images flooding in upon the\nmind, and that it is safer to talk about these “imaginations” than about\n\"the Imagination.” Literary critics will continue to use this last\nexpression–as we are doing in the present chapter–because it is too\nconvenient to be given up. But they mean by it something fairly definite:\nnamely, the images swarming in the stream of consciousness, and their\nintegration into wholes that satisfy the human desire for beauty. It is\nin its ultimate aim rather than in its immediate processes that the\n\"artistic” imagination differs from the inventor’s or scientist’s or\nphilosopher’s imagination. We no longer assert, as did Stopford Brooke\nsome forty years ago, that “the highest scientific intellect is a joke\ncompared with the power displayed by a Shakespeare, a Homer, a Dante.” We\nare inclined rather to believe that in its highest exercise of power the\nscientific mind is attempting much the same feat as the highest type of\npoetic mind, and that in both cases it is a feat of imaginative energy.",
        "2. Creative and Artistic Imagination\nThe reader who has hitherto allowed himself to think of a poet as a sort\nof freak of nature, abnormal in the very constitution of his mind, and\nachieving his results by methods so obscure that “inspiration” is our\nhelpless name for indicating them, cannot do better than master such a\nbook as Ribot’s Essay on the Creative Imagination.\n[Footnote: Th. Ribot, Essai sur l’Imagination créatrice. Paris, 1900.\nEnglish translation by Open Court Co., Chicago, 1906.]\nThis famous psychologist, starting with the conception that the raw\nmaterial for the creative imagination is images, and that its basis lies\nin a motor impulse, examines first the emotional factor involved in every\nact of the creative imagination. Then he passes to the unconscious factor,\nthe involuntary “coming” of the idea, that “moment of genius,” as Buffon\ncalled it, which often marks the end of an unconscious elaboration of the\nidea or the beginning of conscious elaboration.\n[Footnote: See the quotation from Sir William Rowan Hamilton, the\nmathematician, in the “Notes and Illustrations” for this chapter.]\nRibot points out that certain organic changes, as in blood circulation–\nthe familiar rush of blood to the head–accompany imaginative activity.\nThen he discusses the inventor’s and artist’s “fixed idea,” their “will\nthat it shall be so,” “the motor tendency of images engendering the\nideal.” Ribot’s distinction between the animal’s revival of images and the\ntrue creative combination of images in the mental life of children and of\nprimitive man bears directly upon poetry, but even more suggestive to us\nis his diagram of the successive stages by which inventions come into\nbeing. There are two types of this process, and three stages of each: (A)\nthe “idea,” the “discovery” or invention, and then the verification or\napplication; or else (B) the unconscious preparation, followed\nby the “idea” or “inspiration,” and then by the “development” or\nconstruction. Whether a man is inventing a safety-pin or a sonnet, the\nseries of imaginative processes seems to be much the same. There is of\ncourse a typical difference between the “plastic” imagination, dealing\nwith clear images, objective relations, and seen at its best in the arts\nof form like sculpture and architecture, and that “diffluent” imagination\nwhich prefers vaguely outlined images, which is markedly subjective and\nemotional, and of which modern music like Debussy’s is a good example. But\nwhatever may be the specific type of imagination involved, we find alike\nin inventor, scientist and artist the same general sequence of “germ,\nincubation, flowering and completion,” and the same fundamental motor\nimpulse as the driving power.",
        "Holding in mind these general characteristics of the creative imagination,\nas traced by Ribot, let us now test our conception of the distinctively\nartistic imagination. Countless are the attempts to define or describe it,\nand it would be unwise for the student, at this point, to rest satisfied\nwith any single formulation of its functions. But it may be helpful to\nquote a paragraph from Hartley B. Alexander’s brilliant and subtle book,\nPoetry and the Individual:\n[Footnote: Putnam’s, 1906.]",
        "  “The energy of the mind or of the soul–for it welds all psychical\n  activities–which is the agent of our world-winnings and the\n  procreator of our growing life, we term imagination. It is\n  distinguished from perception by its relative freedom from the\n  dictation of sense; it is distinguished from memory by its power to\n  acquire–memory only retains; it is distinguished from emotion in\n  being a force rather than a motive; from the understanding in being\n  an assimilator rather than the mere weigher of what is set before it;\n  from the will, because the will is but the wielder of the reins–the\n  will is but the charioteer, the imagination is the Pharaoh in\n  command. It is distinguished from all these, yet it includes them\n  all, for it is the full functioning of the whole mind and in the\n  total activity drives all mental faculties to its one supreme\n  end–the widening of the world wherein we dwell. Through beauty the\n  world grows, and it is the business of the imagination to create the\n  beautiful. The imagination synthesises, humanises, personalises,\n  illumines reality with the soul’s most intimate moods, and so exalts\n  with spiritual understandings.”",
        "The value of such a description, presented without any context, will vary\nwith the training of the individual reader, but its quickening power will\nbe recognized even by those who are incapable of grasping all the\nintellectual distinctions involved.",
        "3. Poetic Imagination in Particular\nWe are now ready, after this consideration of the creative and artistic\nimagination, to look more closely at some of the qualities of the poetic\nimagination in particular. The specific formal features of that\nimagination lie, as we have seen, in its use of verbal imagery, and in the\ncombination of verbal images into rhythmical patterns. But are there not\nfunctions of the poet’s mind preceding the formation of verbal images? The\npsychology of language is still unsettled, and whether a man can think\nwithout the use of words is often doubted. But a painter can certainly\n\"think” in terms of color, as an architect or mathematician can “think” in\nterms of form and space, or a musician in terms of sound, without\nemploying verbal symbols at all. And are there not characteristic\nactivities of the poetic imagination which antedate the fixation and\nexpression of images in words? Apparently there are.",
        "The reader will find, in the “Notes and Illustrations” for this chapter, a\nquotation from Mr. Lascelles-Abercrombie, in which he refers to the\n\"region where the outward radiations of man’s nature combine with the\nirradiations of the world.” That is to say, the inward-sweeping stream of\nconsciousness is instantly met by an outward-moving activity of the brain\nwhich recognizes relationships between the objects proffered to the senses\nand the personality itself. The “I” projects itself into these objects,\nclaims them, appropriates them as a part of its own nature. Professor\nFairchild, who calls this self-projecting process by the somewhat\nambiguous name of “personalizing,” rightly insists, I believe, that poets\nmake a more distinctive use of this activity than other men. He quotes\nsome of the classic confidences of poets themselves: Keats’s “If a sparrow\ncome before my window I take part in its existence and pick about the\ngravel\"; and Goethe on the sheep pictured by the artist Roos, “I always\nfeel uneasy when I look at these beasts. Their state, so limited, dull,\ngaping, and dreaming, excites in me such sympathy that I fear I shall\nbecome a sheep, and almost think the artist must have been one.” I can\nmatch this Goethe story with the prayer of little Larry H., son of an\neminent Harvard biologist. Larry, at the age of six, was taken by his\nmother to the top of a Vermont hill-pasture, where, for the first time in\nhis life, he saw a herd of cows and was thrilled by their glorious bigness\nand nearness and novelty. When he said his prayers that night, he was\nenough of a poet to change his usual formula into this:",
        "  “Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,\n  Bless thy little cow to-night\"–",
        "Larry being the cow.\n  “There was a child went forth every day,”",
        "records Walt Whitman,",
        "  “And the first object he look’d upon that object\n  he became.”",
        "Professor Fairchild quotes these lines from Whitman, and a few of the many\npassages of the same purport from Coleridge and Wordsworth. They are all\nsummed up in Coleridge’s heart-broken",
        "  “Oh, Lady, we receive but what we give,\n  And in our life alone does Nature live.”",
        "This “animism,” or identifying imagination, by means of which the child or\nthe primitive man or the poet transfers his own life into the unorganic or\norganic world, is one of the oldest and surest indications of poetic\nfaculty, and as far as we can see, it is antecedent to the use of verbal\nimages or symbols.",
        "Another characteristic of the poetic temperament, allied with the\npreceding, likewise seems to belong in the region where words are not as\nyet emerging above the threshold of consciousness. I mean the strange\nfeeling, witnessed to by many poets, of the fluidity, fusibility,\ntransparency–the infinitely changing and interchangeable aspects–of the\nworld as it appears to the senses. It is evident that poets are not\nlooking–at least when in this mood–at our “logical” world of hard, clear\nfact and law. They are gazing rather at what Whitman called “the eternal\nfloat of solution,” the “flowing of all things” of the Greeks, the\n\"river within the river” of Emerson. This tendency is peculiarly marked,\nof course, in artists possessing the “diffluent\" type of imagination, and\nRomantic poets and critics have had much to say about it. The imagination,\nsaid Wordsworth, “recoils from everything but the plastic, the pliant, the\nindefinite.\"\n[Footnote: Preface to 1815 edition of his Poems.]\n\"Shakespeare, too,” says Carlye,\n[Footnote: Essay on Goethe’s Works.]\n\"does not look at a thing, but into it, through it; so that he\nconstructively comprehends it, can take it asunder and put it together\nagain; the thing melts as it were, into light under his eye, and anew\ncreates itself before him. That is to say, he is a Poet. For Goethe, as\nfor Shakespeare, the world lies all translucent, all fusible we might\ncall it, encircled with Wonder; the Natural in reality the Supernatural,\nfor to the seer’s eyes both become one.”",
        "In his essay on Tieck Carlyle remarks again upon this characteristic of\nthe mind of the typical poet: “He is no mere observer and compiler;\nrendering back to us, with additions or subtractions, the Beauty which\nexisting things have of themselves presented to him; but a true Maker, to\nwhom the actual and external is but the excitement for ideal creations\nrepresenting and ennobling its effects.”",
        "Coleridge’s formula is briefer still; the imagination “dissolves,\ndiffuses, dissipates, in order to re-create.\"\n[Footnote: Biographia Literaria.]",
        "Such passages help us to understand the mystical moments which many poets\nhave recorded, in which their feeling of “diffusion” has led them to doubt\nthe existence of the external world. Wordsworth grasping “at a wall or\ntree to recall myself from this abyss of idealism to the reality,” and\nTennyson’s “weird seizures” which he transferred from his own experience\nto his imaginary Prince in The Princess, are familiar examples of this\ntype of mysticism. But the sense of the infinite fusibility and change in\nthe objective world is deeper than that revealed in any one type of\ndiffluent imagination. It is a profound characteristic of the poetic\nmind as such. Yet it should be remembered that the philosopher and\nthe scientist likewise assert that ours is a vital, ever-flowing,\nonward-urging world, in the process of “becoming” rather than merely\n\"being.” “We are far from the noon of man” sang Tennyson, in a\nlate-Victorian and evolutionary version of St. John’s “It doth not\nyet appear what we shall be.” “The primary imagination,” asserted\nColeridge, “is a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of\ncreation in the infinite I am.\"\n[Footnote: Biographia Literaria, chap. 13.]\nHere, evidently, unless the “God-intoxicated” Coleridge is talking\nnonsense, we are in the presence of powers that do not need as yet any use\nof verbal symbols.",
        "4. Verbal Images\nThe plasticity of the world as it appears to the mind of the poet is\nclearly evidenced by the swarm of images which present themselves to the\npoet’s consciousness. In the re-presentation of these pictures to us the\npoet is forced, of course, to use verbal images. The precise point at\nwhich he becomes conscious of employing words no doubt varies with the\nindividual, and depends upon the relative balance of auditory, visual or\ntactile images in his mind. Swinburne often impresses us as working\nprimarily with the “stuff” of word-sounds, as Browning with the stuff of\nsharp-cut tactile or motor images, and Victor Hugo with the stuff of\nvisual impressions. But in each case the poet’s sole medium of expression\nto us is through verbal symbols, and it is hard to get behind these into\nthe real workshop of the brain where each poet is busily minting his own\npeculiar raw material into the current coin of human speech.",
        "Nevertheless, many poets have been sufficiently conscious of what is going\non within their workshop to tell us something about it. Professor\nFairchild has made an interesting collection\n[Footnote: The Making of Poetry, pp. 78, 79.]\nof testimony relating to the tumultuous crowding of images, each\nclamoring, as it were, for recognition and crying “take me!” He instances,\nas other critics have done, the extraordinary succession of images by\nwhich Shelley strives to portray the spirit of the skylark. The similes\nactually chosen by Shelley seem to have been merely the lucky candidates\nselected from an infinitely greater number. In Francis Thompson’s\ncaptivating description of Shelley as a glorious child the reader is\nconscious of the same initial rush of images, although the medium of\nexpression here is heightened prose instead of verse:\n[Footnote: Dublin Review, July, 1908.]",
        "  “Coming to Shelley’s poetry, we peep over the wild mask of\n  revolutionary metaphysics, and we see the winsome face of the child.\n  Perhaps none of his poems is more purely and typically Shelleian than\n  The Cloud, and it is interesting to note how essentially it springs\n  from the faculty of make-believe. The same thing is conspicuous,\n  though less purely conspicuous, throughout his singing; it is the\n  child’s faculty of make-believe raised to the nth power. He is still\n  at play, save only that his play is such as manhood stops to watch,\n  and his playthings are those which the gods give their children. The\n  universe is his box of toys. He dabbles his fingers in the day-fall.\n  He is gold-dusty with tumbling amidst the stars. He makes bright\n  mischief with the moon. The meteors nuzzle their noses in his hand.\n  He teases into growling the kennelled thunder, and laughs at the\n  shaking of its fiery chain. He dances in and out of the gates of\n  heaven: its floor is littered with his broken fancies. He runs wild\n  over the fields of ether. He chases the rolling world. He gets\n  between the feet of the horses of the sun. He stands in the lap of\n  patient Nature, and twines her loosened tresses after a hundred\n  wilful fashions, to see how she will look nicest in his song.”",
        "5. The Selection and Control of Images\nIt is easier, no doubt, to realize something of the swarming of images in\nthe stream of consciousness than it is to understand how these images are\nselected, combined and controlled. Some principle of association, some law\ngoverning the synthesis, there must be; and English criticism has long\ntreasured some of the clairvoyant words of Coleridge and Wordsworth upon\nthis matter. The essential problem is suggested by Wordsworth’s phrase\n\"the manner in which we associate ideas in a state of excitement.” Is the\n\"excitement,” then, the chief factor in the selection and combination of\nimages, and do the “feelings,” as if with delicate tentacles,\ninstinctively choose and reject and integrate such images as blend with\nthe poet’s mood?",
        "Coleridge, with his subtle builder’s instinct, uses his favorite word\n\"synthesis” not merely as applied to images as such, but to all the\nfaculties of the soul:",
        "“The poet, described in ideal perfection, brings the whole soul of man\ninto activity, with the subordination of its faculties to each other\naccording to their relative worth and dignity. He diffuses a tone and a\nspirit of unity, that blends, and as it were fuses, each into each, by\nthat synthetic and magical power to which I would exclusively appropriate\nthe name of Imagination.” “Synthetic and magical power,” indeed, with a\nColeridge as Master of the Mysteries! But the perplexed student of poetry\nmay well wish a more exact description of what really takes place.",
        "An American critic, after much searching in recent psychological\nexplanations of artistic creation, attempts to describe the genesis of a\npoem in these words:\n[Footnote: Lewis E. Gates, Studies and Appreciations, p. 215. Macmillan,\n1900.]",
        "  “The poet concentrates his thought on some concrete piece of life, on\n  some incident, character, or bit of personal experience; because of\n  his emotional temperament, this concentration of interest stirs in\n  him a quick play of feeling and prompts the swift concurrence of many\n  images. Under the incitement of these feelings, and in accordance\n  with laws of association that may at least in part be described,\n  these images grow bright and clear, take definite shapes, fall into\n  significant groupings, branch and ramify, and break into sparkling\n  mimicry of the actual world of the senses–all the time delicately\n  controlled by the poet’s conscious purpose and so growing\n  intellectually significant, but all the time, if the work of art is\n  to be vital, impelled also in their alert weaving of patterns by the\n  moods of the poet, by his fine instinctive sense of the emotional\n  expressiveness of this or that image that lurks in the background of\n  his consciousness. For this intricate web of images, tinged with his\n  most intimate moods, the poet through his intuitive command of words\n  finds an apt series of sound-symbols and records them with written\n  characters. And so a poem arises through an exquisite distillation of\n  personal moods into imagery and into language, and is ready to offer\n  to all future generations its undiminishing store of spiritual joy\n  and strength.”",
        "A better description than this we are not likely to find, although some\ncritics would question the phrase, “all the time delicately controlled by\nthe poet’s conscious purpose.\"\n[Footnote: “Poetry is not like reasoning, a power to be exerted according\nto the determination of the will. A man cannot say, ’I will compose\npoetry.’. . . It is not subject to the control of the active powers of the\nmind. ... Its birth and recurrence have no necessary connection with the\nconsciousness or will.” Shelley, A Defense of Poetry.]",
        "For sometimes, assuredly, the synthesis of images seems to take place\nwithout the volition of the poet. The hypnotic trance, the narcotic dream\nor revery, and even our experience of ordinary dreams, provide abundant\nexamples. One dreams, for instance, of a tidal river, flowing in with a\ngentle full current which bends in one direction all the water-weeds and\nthe long grasses trailing from the banks; then somehow the tide seems to\nchange, and all the water and the weeds and grasses, even the fishes in\nthe stream, turn slowly and flow out to sea. The current synthesizes,\nharmonizes, moves onward like music,–and we are aware that it is all a\ndream. Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan,” composed in a deep opium slumber, moves\nlike that, one train of images melting into another like the interwoven\nfigures of a dance led by the “damsel with a dulcimer.” There is no\n\"conscious purpose” whatever, and no “meaning” in the ordinary\ninterpretation of that word. Nevertheless it is perfect integration of\nimagery, pure beauty to the senses. Something of this rapture in the sheer\nrelease of control must have been in Charles Lamb’s mind when he wrote to\nColeridge about the “pure happiness”  of being insane. “Dream not,\nColeridge, of having tasted all the grandeur and wildness of fancy till\nyou have gone mad! All now seems to me vapid, comparatively so.” (June 10,\n1796.)",
        "If “Kubla Khan” represents one extreme, Poe’s account of how he wrote “The\nRaven\"\n[Footnote: The Philosophy of Composition.]\n–incredible as the story appears to most of us–may serve to illustrate\nthe other, namely, a cool, conscious, workmanlike control of every element\nin the selection and combination of imagery. Wordsworth’s naive\nexplanation of the task performed by the imagination in his “Cuckoo” and\n\"Leech-Gatherer\"\n[Footnote: Preface to poems of 1815-1845.]\noccupies a middle ground. We are at least certain of his entire\nhonesty–and incidentally of his total lack of humor!",
        "  “’Shall I call thee Bird,\n  Or but a wandering Voice?’",
        "“This concise interrogation characterizes the seeming ubiquity of the\nvoice of the cuckoo, and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal\nexistence; the Imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by\na consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard\nthroughout the season of spring, but seldom becomes an object of sight....",
        "  “’As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie\n  Couched on the bald top of an eminence,\n  Wonder to all who do the same espy\n  By what means it could thither come, and whence,\n  So that it seems a thing endued with sense,\n  Like a sea-beast crawled forth, which on a shelf\n  Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun himself.",
        "  Such seemed this Man; not all alive or dead.\n  Nor all asleep, in his extreme old age.\n       *       *       *       *       *\n  Motionless as a cloud the old Man stood,\n  That heareth not the loud winds when they call,\n  And moveth altogether if it move at all.’",
        "“In these images, the conferring, the abstracting, and the modifying\npowers of the Imagination, immediately and mediately acting, are all\nbrought into conjunction. The stone is endowed with something of the power\nof life to approximate it to the sea-beast; and the sea-beast stripped of\nsome of its vital qualities to assimilate it to the stone; which\nintermediate image is thus treated for the purpose of bringing the\noriginal image, that of the stone, to a nearer resemblance to the figure\nand condition of the aged man; who is divested of so much of the\nindications of life and motion as to bring him to the point\nwhere the two objects unite and coalesce in just comparison.”",
        "Wordsworth’s analysis of the processes of his own imagination, like Poe’s\nstory of the composition of “The Raven,” is an analysis made after the\nimagination had functioned. There can be no absolute proof of its\ncorrectness in every detail. It is evident that we have to deal with an\ninfinite variety of normal and abnormal minds. Some of these defy\nclassification; others fall into easily recognized types, such as “the\nlunatic, the lover and the poet,” as sketched by Theseus, Duke of Athens.\nHow modern, after all, is the Duke’s little lecture on the psychology of\nimagination!",
        "  “The lunatic, the lover and the poet\n  Are of imagination all compact;\n  One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,\n  That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,\n  Sees Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt:\n  The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,\n  Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;\n  And as imagination bodies forth\n  The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen\n  Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing\n  A local habitation and a name.\n  Such tricks hath strong imagination,\n  That, if it would but apprehend some joy,\n  It comprehends some bringer of that joy;\n  Or in the night, imagining some fear,\n  How easy is a bush supposed a bear!\"\n[Footnote: Midsummer Night’s Dream, v, i, 7-22.]",
        "Shakspere, it will be observed, does not hesitate to use that dangerous\nterm “the poet!” Yet as students of poetry we must constantly bring\nourselves back to the recorded experience of individual men, and from\nthese make our comparisons and generalizations. It may even happen that\nsome readers will get a clearer conception of the selection and synthesis\nof images if they turn for the moment away from poetry and endeavor to\nrealize something of the same processes as they take place in imaginative\nprose. In Hawthorne’s Scarlet Letter, for example, the dominant image,\nwhich becomes the symbol of his entire theme, is the piece of scarlet\ncloth which originally caught his attention. This physical object\nbecomes, after long brooding, subtly changed into a moral symbol of sin\nand its concealment. It permeates the book, it is borne openly upon the\nbreast of one sufferer, it is written terribly in the flesh of another, it\nflames at last in the very sky. All the lesser images and symbols of the\nromance are mastered by it, subordinated to it; it becomes the dominant\nnote in the composition. The romance of The Scarlet Letter is, as we say\nof any great poem or drama, an “ideal synthesis\"; i.e. a putting together\nof images in accordance with some central idea. The more significant the\nidea or theme or master image, the richer and fuller are the possibilities\nof beauty in detail. Apply this familiar law of complexity to a poet’s\nconscious or unconscious choice of images. In the essay which we have\nalready quoted\n[Footnote: Studies and Appreciations, p. 216.]\nLewis Gates remarks:",
        "“In every artist there is a definite mental bias, a definite spiritual\norganization and play of instincts, which results in large measure from\nthe common life of his day and generation, and which represents this\nlife–makes it potent–within the individuality of the artist. This\nso-called ’acquired constitution of the life of the soul’–it has been\ndescribed by Professor Dilthey with noteworthy acuteness and\nthoroughness–determines in some measure the contents of the artist’s\nmind, for it determines his interests, and therefore the sensations and\nperceptions that he captures and automatically stores up. It guides him in\nhis judgments of worth, in his instinctive likes and dislikes as regards\nconduct and character, and controls in large measure the play of his\nimagination as he shapes the action of his drama or epic and the destinies\nof his heroes. Its prejudices interfiltrate throughout the molecules of\nhis entire moral and mental life, and give to each image and idea some\nslight shade of attractiveness or repulsiveness, so that when the artist’s\nspirit is at work under the stress of feeling, weaving into the fabric of\na poem the competing images and ideas in his consciousness, certain ideas\nand images come more readily and others lag behind, and the resulting work\nof art gets a colour and an emotional tone and suggestions of value that\nsubtly reflect the genius of the age.”",
        "6. “Imagist” Verse\nSuch a conception of the association of images as reflecting not only this\n\"acquired constitution of the soul” of the poet but also the genius of the\nage is in marked contrast to some of the theories held by contemporary\n\"imagists.” As we have already noted, in Chapter II, they stress the\nindividual reaction to phenomena, at some tense moment. They discard, as\nfar as possible, the long “loop-line” of previous experience. As for\ndiction, they have, like all true artists, a horror of the cliché–the\nrubber-stamp word, blurred by use. As for rhythm, they fear any\nconventionality of pattern. In subsequent chapters we must look more\nclosely at these matters of diction and of rhythm, but they are both\ninvolved in any statement of the principles of Imagist verse. Richard\nAldington sums up his article on “The Imagists\"\n[Footnote: “Greenwich Village,” July 15, 1915.]\nin these words:",
        "“Let me resume the cardinal points of the Imagist style:\n1. Direct treatment of the subject. 2. A hardness and economy of speech.\n3. Individuality of rhythm; vers libre. 4. The exact word. The Imagists\nwould like to possess ’le mot qui fait image, l’adjectif inattendu et\nprécis qui dessine de pied en cap et donne la senteur de la chose qu’il\nest chargé de rendre, la touche juste, la couleur qui chatoie et vibre.’”",
        "In the preface to Imagist Poets (1915), and in Miss Amy Lowell’s\nTendencies in Modern American Poetry (1917) the tenets of imagism are\nstated briefly and clearly. Imagism, we are told, aims to use always the\nlanguage of common speech, but to employ always the exact word, not the\nnearly-exact nor the merely decorative word; to create new rhythms–as the\nexpression of new moods–and not to copy old rhythms, which merely echo\nold moods; to allow absolute freedom in the choice of a subject; to\npresent an image, rendering particulars exactly; to produce poetry that is\nhard and clear, never blurred or indefinite; to secure condensation.",
        "It will be observed that in the special sort of picture-making which\nImagist poetry achieves, the question of free verse is merely incidental.\n\"We fight for it as a principle of liberty,” says Miss Lowell, but she\ndoes not insist upon it as the only method of writing poetry. Mr.\nAldington admits frankly that about forty per cent of vers libre is\nprose. Mr. Lowes, as we have already remarked, has printed dozens of\npassages from Meredith’s novels in the typographical arrangement of free\nverse so as to emphasize their “imagist” character. One of the most\neffective is this:",
        "  “He was like a Tartar\n  Modelled by a Greek:\n  Supple\n  As the Scythian’s bow,\n  Braced\n  As the string!”",
        "Suppose, however, that we agree to defer for the moment the vexed question\nas to whether images of this kind are to be considered prose or verse.\nExamine simply for their vivid picture-making quality the collections\nentitled Imagist Poets (1915,1916,1917), or, in the Anthology of\nMagazine Verse for 1915, such poems as J. G. Fletcher’s “Green Symphony\"\nor “H. D.’s” “Sea-Iris” or Miss Lowell’s “The Fruit Shop.” Read Miss\nLowell’s extraordinarily brilliant volume Men, Women and Ghosts (1916),\nparticularly the series of poems entitled “Towns in Colour.” Then read the\nauthor’s preface, in which her artistic purpose in writing “Towns in\nColour” is set forth: “In these poems, I have endeavoured to give the\ncolour, and light, and shade, of certain places and hours, stressing the\npurely pictorial effect, and with little or no reference to any other\naspect of the places described. It is an enchanting thing to wander\nthrough a city looking for its unrelated beauty, the beauty by which it\ncaptivates the sensuous sense of seeing.” [Footnote: Italics mine.]",
        "Nothing could be more gallantly frank than the phrase “unrelated beauty.\"\nFor it serves as a touchstone to distinguish between those imagist poems\nwhich leave us satisfied and those which do not. Sometimes, assuredly, the\ninsulated, unrelated beauty is enough. What delicate reticence there is in\nRichard Aldington’s “Summer”:",
        "  “A butterfly,\n  Black and scarlet,\n  Spotted with white,\n  Fans its wings\n  Over a privet flower.",
        "  “A thousand crimson foxgloves,\n  Tall bloody pikes,\n  Stand motionless in the gravel quarry;\n  The wind runs over them.",
        "  “A rose film over a pale sky\n  Fantastically cut by dark chimneys;\n  Across an old city garden.”",
        "The imagination asks no more.",
        "Now read my friend Baker Brownell’s “Sunday Afternoon”:",
        "  “The wind pushes huge bundles\n  Of itself in warm motion\n  Through the barrack windows;\n  It rattles a sheet of flypaper\n  Tacked in a smear of sunshine on the sill.\n  A voice and other voices squirt\n  A slow path among the room’s tumbled sounds.\n  A ukelele somewhere clanks\n  In accidental jets\n  Up from the room’s background.”",
        "Here the stark truthfulness of the images does not prevent an instinctive\n\"Well, what of it?” “And afterward, what else?” Unless we adopt the\nJapanese theory of “stop poems,” where the implied continuation of the\nmood, the suggested application of the symbol or allegory, is the sole\njustification of the actual words given, a great deal of imagist verse, in\nmy opinion, serves merely to sharpen the senses without utilizing the full\nimaginative powers of the mind. The making of images is an essential\nportion of the poet’s task, but in memorably great poetry it is only a\ndetail in a  larger whole. Miss Lowell’s “Patterns” is one of the most\neffective of contemporary poems, but it is far more than a document of\nimagism. It is a triumph of structural imagination.",
        "7. Genius and Inspiration\nWhatever may be the value, for students, of trying to analyse the\nimage-making and image-combining faculty, every one admits that it is a\nnecessary element in the production of poetry. Let Coleridge have the\nfinal statement of this mystery of his art: “The power of reducing\nmultitude into unity of effect, and modifying a series of thoughts by some\none predominant thought or feeling, may be cultivated and improved, but\ncan never be learnt. It is in this that Poeta nascitur non fit.” We\ncannot avoid the difficulties of the question by attributing the poet’s\nimagination to “genius.” Whether genius is a neurosis, as some think, or\nwhether it is sanity at perfection, makes little difference here.\nBoth a Poe and a Sophocles are equally capable of producing ideal\nsyntheses. Nor does the old word “inspiration” help much either.\nWhatever we mean by inspiration–a something not ourselves, supernatural\nor sub-liminal–a “vision” of Blake, the “voices” of Joan of Arc, the\n\"god” that moved within the Corybantian revelers–it is an excitement of\nthe image-making faculty, and not that faculty itself. Disordered “genius\"\nand inspiration undisciplined by reason are alike powerless to produce\nimages that permanently satisfy the sense of beauty. Tolstoy’s common-\nsense remark is surely sound: “One’s writing is good only where the\nintelligence and the imagination are in equilibrium. As soon as one of\nthem over-balances the other, it’s all up.\"\n[Footnote: Compare W. A. Neilson’s chapter on “The Balance of Qualities\"\nin Essentials of Poetry. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1912.]",
        "8. A Summary\nLet us now endeavor to summarize this testimony which we have taken\nfrom poets and critics. Though they do not agree in all details, and\nthough they often use words that are either too vague or too highly\nspecialized, the general drift of the testimony is fairly clear. Poets\nand critics agree that the imagination is something different from the\nmere memory-image; that by a process of selection and combination and\nre-presentation of images something really new comes into being, and that\nwe are therefore justified in using the term constructive, or creativeimagination. This imagination embodies, as we say, or “bodies forth,” as\nDuke Theseus said, “the forms of things unknown.” It ultimately becomes\nthe poet’s task to “shape” these forms with his “pen,” that is to say, to\nsuggest them through word-symbols, arranged in a certain fashion. The\nselection of these word-symbols will be discussed in Chapter IV, and their\nrhythmical arrangement in Chapter V. But we have tried in the present\nchapter to trace the functioning of the poetic imagination in those stages\nof its activity which precede the definite shaping of poems with the pen.\nIf we say, with Professor Fairchild,\n[Footnote: Making of Poetry, p. 34.]\nthat “the central processes or kinds of activity involved in the making of\npoetry are three: personalizing, combining and versifying,” it is obvious\nthat we have been dealing with the first two. If we prefer to use the\nfamous terms employed by Ruskin in Modern Painters, we have been\nconsidering the penetrative, associative and contemplative types of\nimagination. But these Ruskinian names, however brilliantly and\nsuggestively employed by the master, are dangerous tools for the beginner\nin the study of poetry.",
        "If the beginner desires to review, at this point, the chief matters\nbrought to his attention in the present chapter, he may make a real test\nof their validity by opening his senses to the imagery of a few lines of\npoetry. Remember that poets are endeavoring to convey the “sense” of\nthings rather than the knowledge of things. Disregard for the moment the\nprecise words employed in the following lines, and concentrate the\nattention upon the images, as if the image were not made of words at all,\nbut were mere naked sense-stimulus.",
        "In this line the poet is trying to make us see something (\"visual\"\nimage):",
        "  “The bride hath paced into the hall,\n  Red as a rose is she.”",
        "Can you see her?",
        "In these lines the poet is trying to make us hear something (\"auditory\"\nimage):",
        "  “A noise like of a hidden brook  In the leafy month of June\n  That to the sleeping woods all night\n  Singeth a quiet tune.”",
        "Do you hear the tune? Do you hear it as clearly as you can hear",
        "  ’The tambourines\n  Jing-jing-jingled in the hands of Queens”?",
        "In these lines the poet is trying to make us feel certain bodily\nsensations (\"tactile” image):",
        "  “I closed my lids and kept them close,\n  And the balls like pulses beat;\n  For the sky and the sea and the sea and the sky,\n  Lay like a load on my weary eye,\n  And the dead were at my feet.”",
        "Do your eyes feel that pressure?",
        "You are sitting quite motionless in your chair as you read these lines\n(\"motor” image):",
        "  “I sprang to the stirrup, and Joris, and he;\n  I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three!”",
        "Are you instantly on horseback? If you are, the poet has put you there by\nconveying from his mind to yours, through the use of verbal imagery and\nrhythm, his “sense” of riding, which has now become your sense of\nriding.",
        "If the reader can meet this test of realizing simple images through his\nown body-and-mind reaction to their stimulus, the door of poetry is open\nto him. He can enter into its limitless enjoyments. If he wishes to\nanalyse more closely the nature of the pleasure which poetry affords, he\nmay select any lines he happens to like, and ask himself how the various\nfunctions of the imagination are illustrated by them. Suppose the lines\nare Coleridge’s description of the bridal procession, already quoted in\npart:",
        "  “The bride hath paced into the hall,\n   Red as a rose is she;\n   Nodding their heads before her goes\n   The merry minstrelsy.”",
        "Here surely is imagination penetrative; the selection of some one\ncharacteristic trait of the object; that trait (the “redness” or the\n\"nodding”) re-presented to us, and emphasized by conferring, modifying or\nabstracting whatever elements the poet wishes to stress or to suppress.\nThe result is a combination of imagery which forms an idealized picture,\npresenting the shows of things as the mind would like to see them and thus\nsatisfying our sense of beauty. For there is no question that the mind\ntakes a supreme satisfaction in such an idealization of reality as\nColeridge’s picture of the swift tropical sunset,",
        "  “At one stride comes the dark,”",
        "or Emerson’s picture of the slow New England sunrise,",
        "  “O tenderly the haughty day\n  Fills his blue urn with fire.”",
        "Little has been said about beauty in this chapter, but no one doubts that\na sense of beauty guides the “shaping spirit of imagination” in that dim\nregion through which the poet feels his way before he comes to the\nconscious choice of expressive words and to the ordering of those words\ninto beautiful rhythmical designs.",

        "  “Words are sensible signs necessary for communication.\"\n    JOHN LOCKE, Human Understanding, 3, 2, 1.",
        "  “As conceptions are the images of things to the mind within itself, so\n  are words or names the marks of those conceptions to the minds of them\n  we converse with.\"\n    SOUTH, quoted in Johnson’s Dictionary.",
        "  “Word: a sound, or combination of sounds, used in any language as the\n  sign of a conception, or of a conception together with its grammatical\n  relations.... A word is a spoken sign that has arrived at its value as\n  used in any language by a series of historical changes, and that holds\n  its value by virtue of usage, being exposed to such further changes, of\n  form and of meaning, as usage may prescribe....\"\n    Century Dictionary.",
        "  “A word is not a crystal–transparent and unchanged; it is the skin of a\n  living thought, and may vary greatly in color and content according to\n  the circumstances and the time in which it is used.\"\n    Justice OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES, Towne vs. Eisner.",
        "  “I wish our clever young poets would remember my homely definitions of\n  prose and poetry; that is, prose = words in their best order;–poetry =\n  the best words in the best order.\"\n    COLERIDGE, Table Talk.",
        "1. The Eye and the Ear\n\"Literary\" language is commonly distinguished from the language of\nordinary life by certain heightenings or suppressions. The novelist or\nessayist, let us say, fashions his language more or less in accordance\nwith his own mood, with his immediate aim in writing, with the capacity of\nhis expected readers. He is discoursing with a certain real or imaginary\naudience. He may put himself on paper, as Montaigne said, as if he were\ntalking to the first man he happens to meet; or he may choose to address\nhimself to the few chosen spirits of his generation and of succeeding\ngenerations. He trusts the arbitrary written or printed symbols of\nword-sounds to carry his thoughts safely into the minds of other men.\nThe “literary” user of language in modern times comes to depend upon\nthe written or printed page; he tends to become more or less “eye-minded\";\nwhereas the typical orator remains “ear-minded\"–i.e. peculiarly sensitive\nto a series of sounds, and composing for the ear of listeners rather than\nfor the eye of readers.",
        "Now as compared with the typical novelist, the poet is surely, like the\norator, “ear-minded.” Tonal symbols of ideas and emotions, rather than\nvisual symbols of ideas and emotions, are the primary stuff with which he\nis working, although as soon as the advancing civilization of his race\nbrings an end to the primitive reciting of poetry and its transmission\nthrough oral repetition alone, it is obvious that he must depend, like\nother literary artists, or like the modern musicians, upon the written or\nprinted signs for the sounds which he has composed. But so stubborn are\nthe habits of our eyes that we tend always to confuse the look of the\npoet’s words upon the printed page with the sound of those words as they\nare perceived by the ear. We are seldom guilty of this confusion in the\ncase of the musician. His “music” is not identified with the arbitrary\nblack marks which make up his printed score. For most of us there is\nno music until those marks are actually translated into terms of tone–\nalthough it is true that the trained reader of music can easily translate\nto his inner ear without any audible rendering of the indicated sounds.",
        "This distinction is essential to the understanding of poetry. A poem is\nnot primarily a series of printed word-signs addressed to the eye; it is a\nseries of sounds addressed to the ear, and the arbitrary symbols for these\nsounds do not convey the poem unless they are audibly rendered–except to\nthose readers who, like the skilled readers of printed music, can\ninstantly hear the indicated sounds without any actual rendition of them\ninto physical tone. Many professed lovers of poetry have no real ear for\nit. They are hopelessly “eye-minded.” They try to decide questions of\nmetre and stanza, of free verse and of emotionally patterned prose by the\nappearance of the printed page instead of by the nerves of hearing. Poets\nlike Mr. Vachel Lindsay–who recites or chants his own verses after the\nmanner of the primitive bard–have rendered a true service by leading\nus away from the confusions wrought by typography, and back to that sheer\ndelight in rhythmic oral utterance in which poetry originates.",
        "2. How Words convey Feeling\nFor it must never be forgotten that poetry begins in excitement, in some\nbody-and-mind experience; that it is capable, through its rhythmic\nutterance of words which suggest this experience, of transmitting emotion\nto the hearer; and that the nature of language allows the emotion to be\nembodied in more or less permanent form. Let us look more closely at some\nof the questions involved in the origin, the transmission and embodiment\nof poetic feeling, remembering that we are now trying to trace these\nprocesses in so far as they are revealed by the poet’s use of words.\nRhythm will be discussed in the next chapter.",
        "We have already noted that there are no mental images of feeling itself.\nThe images recognized by the consciousness of poets are those of\nexperiences and objects associated with feeling. The words employed to\nrevive and transmit these images are usually described as “concrete” or\n\"sensuous” in distinction from abstract or purely conceptual. They are\n\"experiential” words, arising out of bodily or spiritual contact with\nobjects or ideas that have been personalized, colored with individual\nfeeling. Such words have a “fringe,” as psychologists say. They are rich\nin overtones of meaning; not bare, like words addressed to the sheer\nintelligence, but covered with veils of association, with tokens of past\nexperience. They are like ships laden with cargoes, although the cargo\nvaries with the texture and the history of each mind. It is probable that\nthis very word “ship,” just now employed, calls up as many different\nmental images as there are readers of this page. Brander Matthews has\nrecorded a curious divergence of imagery aroused by the familiar word\n\"forest.” Half a dozen well-known men of letters, chatting together in a\nLondon club, tried to tell one another what “forest” suggested to each:",
        "  “Until that evening I had never thought of forest as clothing itself\n  in different colors and taking on different forms in the eyes of\n  different men; but I then discovered that even the most innocent\n  word may don strange disguises. To Hardy forest suggested the sturdy\n  oaks to be assaulted by the woodlanders of Wessex; and to Du Maurier\n  it evoked the trim and tidy avenues of the national domain of France.\n  To Black the word naturally brought to mind the low scrub of the\n  so-called deer-forests of Scotland; and to Gosse it summoned up a\n  view of the green-clad mountains that towered up from the\n  Scandinavian fiords. To Howells forest recalled the thick woods that\n  in his youth fringed the rivers of Ohio; and to me there came back\n  swiftly the memory of the wild growths, bristling unrestrained by\n  man, in the Chippewa Reservation which I had crossed fourteen years\n  before in my canoe trip from Lake Superior to the Mississippi. Simple\n  as the word seemed, it was interpreted by each of us in accord with\n  his previous personal experience. And these divergent experiences\n  exchanged that evening brought home to me as never before the\n  inherent and inevitable inadequacy of the vocabulary of every\n  language, since there must always be two partners in any communication\n  by means of words, and the verbal currency passing from one to the other\n  has no fixed value necessarily the same to both of them.\"\n[Footnote: Brander Matthews, These Many Years. Scribner’s, New York,\n1917.]",
        "But one need not journey to London town in order to test this matter. Let\nhalf a dozen healthy young Americans stop before the window of a shop\nwhere sporting goods are exhibited. Here are fishing-rods, tennis\nracquets, riding-whips, golf-balls, running-shoes, baseball bats,\nfootballs, oars, paddles, snow-shoes, goggles for motorists, Indian clubs\nand rifles. Each of these physical objects focuses the attention of the\nobserver in more or less exact proportion to his interest in the\nparticular sport suggested by the implement. If he is a passionate tennis\nplayer, a thousand motor-tactile memories are stirred by the sight of the\nracquet. He is already balancing it in his fingers, playing his favorite\nstrokes with it, winning tournaments with it–though he seems to be\nstanding quietly in front of the window. The man next him is already\nsnowshoeing over the frozen hills. But if a man has never played lacrosse,\nor been on horseback, or mastered a canoe, the lacrosse racquet or\nriding-whip or paddle mean little to him emotionally, except that they may\nstir his imaginative curiosity about a sport whose pleasures he has never\nexperienced. His eye is likely to pass them over as indifferently as if he\nwere glancing at the window of a druggist or a grocer. These varying\nresponses of the individual to the visual stimulus of this or that\nphysical object in a heterogeneous collection may serve to illustrate his\ncapacity for feeling. Our chance group before the shop window thus becomes\na symbol of all human minds as they confront the actual visible universe.\nThey hunger and thirst for this or that particular thing, while another\nobject leaves them cold.",
        "Now suppose that our half-dozen young men are sitting in the dark,\ntalking–evoking body-and-mind memories by means of words alone. No two\ncan possibly have the same memories, the same series of mental pictures.\nNot even the most vivid and picturesque word chosen by the best talker of\nthe company has the same meaning for them all. They all understand the\nword, approximately, but each feels it in a way unexperienced by his\nfriend. The freightage of significance carried by each concrete, sensuous,\npicture-making word is bound to vary according to the entire physical and\nmental history of the man who hears it. Even the commonest and most\nuniversal words for things and sensations–such as “hand,” “foot,” “dark,\"\n\"fear,” “fire,” “warm,” “home\"–are suffused with personal emotions,\nfaintly or clearly felt; they have been or are my hand, foot, fear,\ndarkness, warmth, happiness. Now the poet is like a man talking or singing\nin the dark to a circle of friends. He cannot say to them “See this” or\n\"Feel that” in the literal sense of “see” and “feel\"; he can only call up\nby means of words and tunes what his friends have seen and felt already,\nand then under the excitement of such memories suggest new combinations,\nnew weavings of the infinitely varied web of human experience, new voyages\nwith fresh sails upon seas untried.",
        "It is true that we may picture the poet as singing or talking to himself\nin solitude and darkness, obeying primarily the impulse of expression\nrather than of communication. Hence John Stuart Mill’s distinction between\nthe orator and the poet: “Eloquence is heard; poetry is overheard.\nEloquence supposes an audience. The peculiarity of poetry appears to us to\nlie in the poet’s utter unconsciousness of a listener. Poetry is feeling\nconfessing itself to itself in moments of solitude, and embodying itself\nin symbols which are the nearest possible representations of the feeling\nin the exact shape in which it exists in the poet’s mind.\"\n[Footnote: J. S. Mill, “Thoughts on Poetry,” in Dissertations, vol. 1.\nSee also F. N. Scott, “The Most Fundamental Differentia of Poetry and\nProse.” Published by Modern Language Association, 19, 2.]\nBut whether his primary aim be the relief of his own feelings (for a man\nswears even when he is alone!) or the communication of his feelings to\nother persons, it remains true that a poet’s language betrays his bodily\nand mental history. “The poet,” said Thoreau, “writes the history of his\nown body.”",
        "For example, a study of Browning’s vocabulary made by Professor C. H.\nHerford\n[Footnote: Robert Browning, Modern English Writers, pp. 244-66.\nBlackwood & Sons. 1905.]\nemphasizes that poet’s acute tactual and muscular sensibilities, his quick\nand eager apprehension of space-relations:",
        "  “He gloried in the strong sensory-stimulus of glowing color, of\n  dazzling light; in the more complex motory-stimulus of intricate,\n  abrupt and plastic form.... He delighted in the angular, indented,\n  intertwining, labyrinthine varieties of line and surface which call\n  for the most delicate, and at the same time most agile, adjustments\n  of the eye. He caught at the edges of things.... Spikes and\n  wedges and swords run riot in his work.... He loved the grinding,\n  clashing and rending sibilants and explosives as Tennyson the\n  tender-hefted liquids.... He is the poet of sudden surprises,\n  unforseen transformations.... The simple joy in abrupt changes of\n  sensation which belonged to his riotous energy of nerve lent support\n  to his peremptory way of imagining all change and especially all\n  vital and significant becoming.”",
        "The same truth is apparent as we pass from the individual poet to the\npoetic literature of his race. Here too is the stamp of bodily history.\nHebrew poetry, as is well known, is always expressing emotion in terms of\nbodily sensation.",
        "  ’Anger,” says Renan,\n  [Footnote: Quoted by J. H. Gardiner, The Bible as Literature, p.\n  114.]\n  “is expressed in Hebrew in a throng of ways, each picturesque, and\n  each borrowed from physiological facts. Now the metaphor is taken\n  from the rapid and animated breathing which accompanies the passion,\n  now from heat or from boiling, now from the act of a noisy breaking,\n  now from shivering. Discouragement and despair are expressed by\n  the melting of the heart, fear by the loosening of the reins.\n  Pride is portrayed by the holding high of the head, with the figure\n  straight and stiff. Patience is a long breathing, impatience  short breathing, desire is thirst or paleness. Pardon is expressed\n  by a throng of metaphors borrowed from the idea of covering, of\n  hiding, of coating over the fault. In Job God sews up sins in a\n  sack, seals it, then throws it behind him: all to signify that he\n  forgets them....",
        "  “My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord; my\n  heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.",
        "  “Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.",
        "  “I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep\n  waters, where the floods overflow me.",
        "  “I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I\n  wait for my God.”",
        "Greek poetry, likewise, is made out of “warm, swift, vibrating” words,\nthrilling with bodily sensation. Gilbert Murray\n[Footnote: “What English Poetry may Learn from Greek,” Atlantic Monthly,\nNovember, 1912.]\nhas described the weaving of these beautiful single words into patterns:",
        "  “The whole essence of lyric is rhythm. It is the weaving of words\n  into a song-pattern, so that the mere arrangement of the syllables\n  produces a kind of dancing joy.... Greek lyric is derived directly\n  from the religious dance; that is, not merely the pattering of the\n  feet, but the yearning movement of the whole body, the ultimate\n  expression of emotion that cannot be pressed into articulate speech,\n  compact of intense rhythm and intense feeling.”",
        "Nor should it be forgotten that Milton, while praising “a graceful and\nornate rhetoric,” declares that poetry, compared with this, is “more\nsimple, sensuous and passionate.\"\n[Footnote: Tract on Education. ]\nThese words “sensuous” and “passionate,” dulled as they have become by\nrepetition, should be interpreted in their full literal sense. While\nlanguage is unquestionably a social device for the exchange of ideas and\nfeelings, it is also true that poetic diction is a revelation of\nindividual experience, of body-and-mind contacts with reality. Every poet\nis still an Adam in the Garden, inventing new names as fast as the new\nwonderful Beasts–-so terrible, so delightful!–come marching by.",
        "3. Words as Current Coin\nBut the poet’s words, stamped and colored as they are by unique individual\nexperience, must also have a general transmission value which renders\nthem current coin. If words were merely representations of private\nexperience, merely our own nicknames for things, they would not pass the\nwalls of the Garden inhabited by each man’s imagination. “Expression\"\nwould be possible, but “communication” would be impossible, and indeed\nthere would be no recognizable terms of expression except the “bow-wow” or\n\"pooh-pooh” or “ding-dong” of the individual Adam––and even these\nexpressive syllables might not be the ones acceptable to Eve!",
        "The truth is that though the impulse to expression is individual, and that\nin highly developed languages a single man can give his personal stamp to\nwords, making them say what he wishes them to say, as Dante puts it,\nspeech is nevertheless primarily a social function. A word is a social\ninstrument. “It belongs,” says Professor Whitney,\n[Footnote: W. D. Whitney, Language and the Study of Language, p. 404.]\n\"not to the individual, but to the member of society.... What we may\nseverally choose to say is not language until it be accepted and employed\nby our fellows. The whole development of speech, though initiated by the\nacts of individuals, is wrought out by the community.”",
        "... A solitary man would never frame a language. Let a child grow up in\nutter seclusion, and, however rich and suggestive might be the nature\naround him, however full and appreciative his sense of that which lay\nwithout, and his consciousness of that which went on within him, he would\nall his life remain a mute.”",
        "What is more, the individual’s mastery of language is due solely to his\nsocial effort in employing it. Speech materials are not inherited; they\nare painfully acquired. It is well known that an English child brought up\nin China and hearing no word of English will speak Chinese without a trace\nof his English parentage in form or idiom.\n[Footnote: See Baldwin’s Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology,\narticle “Language.\"]\nHis own body-and-mind experiences will be communicated in the medium\nalready established by the body-and-mind experiences of the Chinese race.\nIn that medium only can the thoughts of this English-born child have any\ntransmission value. His father and mother spoke a tongue moulded by\nChaucer and Shakspere, but to the boy whom we have imagined all that\nage-long labor of perfecting a social instrument of speech is lost\nwithout a trace. As far as language is concerned, he is a Chinaman and\nnothing else.",
        "Now take the case of a Chinese boy who has come to an American school and\ncollege. Just before writing this paragraph I have read the blue-book of\nsuch a boy, written in a Harvard examination on Tennyson. It was an\nexceptionally well-expressed blue-book, in idiomatic English, and it\nrevealed an unusual appreciation of Tennyson’s delicate and sure\nfelicities of speech. The Chinese boy, by dint of an intellectual effort\nof which most of his American classmates were incapable, had mastered many\nof the secrets of an alien tongue, and had taken possession of the rich\ntreasures of English poetry. If he had been composing verse himself,\ninstead of writing a college blue-book, it is likely that he would have\npreferred to use his own mother-tongue, as the more natural medium for the\nexpression of his intimate thoughts and feelings. But that expression, no\nmatter how artistic, would have “communicated” nothing whatever to an\nAmerican professor ignorant of the Chinese language. It is clear that the\npower of any person to convey his ideas and emotions to others is\nconditioned upon the common possession of some medium of exchange.",
        "4. Words an Imperfect Medium\nAnd it is precisely here that we face one of the fundamental difficulties\nof the poet’s task; a difficulty that affects, indeed, all human\nintercourse. For words are notoriously an imperfect medium of\ncommunication. They “were not invented at first,” says Professor Walter\nRaleigh in his book on Wordsworth, “and are very imperfectly adapted at\nbest, for the severer purposes of truth. They bear upon them all the\nweaknesses of their origin, and all the maims inflicted by the\nprejudices and fanaticisms of generations of their employers. They\nperpetuate the memory or prolong the life of many noble forms of human\nextravagance, and they are the monuments of many splendid virtues. But\nwith all their abilities and dignities they are seldom well fitted for the\nquiet and accurate statement of the thing that is.... Beasts fight with\nhorns, and men, when the guns are silent, with words. The changes of\nmeaning in words from good to bad and from bad to good senses, which are\nquite independent of their root meaning, is proof enough, without detailed\nillustration, of the incessant nature of the strife. The question is not\nwhat a word means, but what it imputes.\"\n[Footnote: Raleigh’s Wordsworth. London, 1903.]",
        "Now if the quiet and accurate statement of things as they are is the ideal\nlanguage of prose, it is obvious that the characteristic diction of poetry\nis unquiet, inaccurate, incurably emotional. Herein lie its dangers and\nits glories. No poet can keep for very long to the “neutral style,” to the\ncool gray wallpaper words, so to speak; he wants more color–-passionate\nwords that will “stick fiery off” against the neutral background of\nconventional diction. In vain does Horace warn him against “purple\npatches\"; for he knows that the tolerant Horace allowed himself to use\npurple patches whenever he wished. All employers of language for emotional\neffect–orators, novelists, essayists, writers of editorials–utilize in\ncertain passages these colored, heightened, figured words. It is as if\nthey ordered their printers to set individual words or whole groups of\nwords in upper-case type.",
        "And yet these “upper-case words” of heightened emotional value are not\nreally isolated from their context. Their values are relative and not\nabsolute. Like the high lights of a picture, their effectiveness depends\nupon the tone of the composition as a whole. To insert a big or violent\nword for its own potency is like sewing the purple patch upon a faded\ngarment. The predominant thought and feeling of a passage give the\nrichest individual words their penetrating power, just as the weight of\nthe axe-head sinks the blade into the wood. “Futurist” poets like\nMarinetti have protested against the bonds of syntax, the necessity of\nlogical subject and predicate, and have experimented with nouns alone.\n\"Words delivered from the fetters of punctuation,” says Marinetti, “will\nflash against one another, will interlace their various forms of\nmagnetism, and follow the uninterrupted dynamics of force.\"\n[Footnote: There is an interesting discussion of Futurism in Sir Henry\nNewbolt’s New Study of English Poetry. Dutton, 1919.]\nBut do they? The reader may judge for himself in reading Marinetti’s poem\non the siege of a Turkish fort:",
        "  “Towers guns virility flights erection telemetre exstacy toumbtoumb 3\n  seconds toumbtoumb waves smiles laughs plaff poaff glouglouglouglou\n  hide-and-seek crystals virgins flesh jewels pearls iodine salts\n  bromide skirts gas liqueurs bubbles 3 seconds toumbtoumb officer\n  whiteness telemetre cross fire megaphone sight-at-thousand-metres\n  all-men-to-left enough every-man-to-his post incline-7-degrees\n  splendour jet pierce immensity azure deflowering onslaught alleys\n  cries labyrinth mattress sobs ploughing desert bed precision\n  telemetre monoplane cackling theatre applause monoplane equals\n  balcony rose wheel drum trepan gad-fly rout arabs oxen blood-colour\n  shambles wounds refuge oasis.”",
        "In these vivid nouns there is certainly some raw material for a poem, just\nas a heap of bits of colored glass might make material for a rose-window.\nBut both poem and window must be built by somebody: the shining fragments\nwill never fashion themselves into a whole.",
        "5. Predominant Tone-Feeling\nIf each poem is composed in its own “key,” as we say of music, with its\nown scale of “values,” as we say of pictures, it is obvious that the\nseparate words tend to take on tones and hues from the predominant\ntone-feeling of the poem. It is a sort of protective coloration, like\nNature’s devices for blending birds and insects into their background; or,\nto choose a more prosaic illustration, like dipping a lump of sugar into a\ncup of coffee. The white sugar and the yellowish cream and the black\ncoffee blend into something unlike any of the separate ingredients, yet\nthe presence of each is felt. It is true that some words refuse to be\nabsorbed into the texture of the poem: they remain as it were foreign\nsubstances in the stream of imagery, something alien, stubborn, jarring,\nalthough expressive enough in themselves. All the pioneers in poetic\ndiction assume this risk of using “un-poetic” words in their desire to\nemploy expressive words. Classic examples are Wordsworth’s homely “tubs\"\nand “porringers,” and Walt Whitman’s catalogues of everyday implements\nused in various trades. Othello was hissed upon its first appearance on\nthe Paris stage because of that “vulgar” word handkerchief. Thus “fork\"\nand “spoon” have almost purely utilitarian associations and are\nconsequently difficult terms for the service of poetry, but “knife” has a\nwider range of suggestion. Did not the peaceful Robert Louis Stevenson\nconfess his romantic longing to “knife a man”?",
        "But it is not necessary to multiply illustrations of this law of\nconnotation. The true poetic value of a word lies partly in its history,\nin its past employments, and partly also in the new vitality which it\nreceives from each brain which fills the word with its own life. It is\nlike an old violin, with its subtle overtones, the result of many\nvibrations of the past, but yet each new player may coax a new tune from\nit. When Wordsworth writes of",
        "  “The silence that is in the starry sky,\n  The sleep that is among the lonely hills,”",
        "he is combining words that are immemorially familiar into a total effect\nthat is peculiarly “Wordsworthian.” Diction is obviously only a part of a\ngreater whole in which ideas and emotions are also merged. A concordance\nof all the words employed by a poet teaches us much about him, and\nconversely a knowledge of the poet’s personality and of his governing\nideas helps us in the study of his diction. Poets often have favorite\nwords–like Marlowe’s “black,” Shelley’s “light,” Tennyson’s “wind,\"\nSwinburne’s “fire.” Each of these words becomes suffused with the whole\npersonality of the poet who employs it. It not only cannot be taken out of\nits context in the particular poem in which it appears, but it cannot be\nadequately felt without some recognition of the particular sensational\nand emotional experience which prompted its use. Many concordance-hunters\nthus miss the real game, and fall into the Renaissance error of\nword-grubbing for its own sake, as if mere words had a value of their own\nindependently of the life breathed into them by living men. I recall a\nconversation at Bormes with the French poet Angellier. He was complaining\nhumorously of his friend L., a famous scholar whose big book was “carrying\nall the treasures of French literature down to posterity like a\ncold-storage transport ship.” “But he published a criticism of one of my\npoems,” Angellier went on, “which proved that he did not understand the\npoem at all. He had studied it too hard! The words of a poem are\nstepping-stones across a brook. If you linger on one of them too long, you\nwill get your feet wet! You must cross, vite!” If the poets lead us from\none mood to another over a bridge of words, the words themselves are not\nthe goal of the journey. They are instruments used in the transmission of\nemotion.",
        "6. Specific Tone-Color\nIt is obvious, then, that the full poetic value of a word cannot be\nascertained apart from its context. The value is relative and not\nabsolute. And nevertheless, just as the bit of colored glass may have a\ncertain interest and beauty of its own, independently of its possible\nplace in the rose-window, it is true that separate words possess special\nqualities of physical and emotional suggestiveness. Dangerous as it is to\ncharacterize the qualities of the sound of a word apart from the sense of\nthat word, there is undeniably such a thing as “tone-color.” A piano and a\nviolin, striking the same note, are easily differentiated by the quality\nof the sound, and of two violins, playing the same series of notes, it is\nusually possible to declare which instrument has the richer tone or\ntimbre. Words, likewise, differ greatly in tone-quality. A great deal of\ningenuity has been devoted to the analysis of “bright” and “dark” vowels,\nsmooth and harsh consonants, with the aim of showing that each sound has\nits special expressive force, its peculiar adaptability to transmit a\ncertain kind of feeling. Says Professor A. H. Tolman:\n[Footnote: “The Symbolic Value of Sounds,” in Hamlet and Other Essays,\nby A. H. Tolman. Boston, 1904.]",
        "  “Let us arrange the English vowel sounds in the following scale:",
        "  [short i] (little)     [long i]   (I)         [short oo] (wood)\n  [short e] (met)        [long u]   (due)       [long ow]  (cow)\n  [short a] (mat)        [short ah] (what)      [long o]   (gold)\n  [long e]  (mete)       [long ah]  (father)    [long oo]  (gloom)\n  [ai]      (fair)       [oi]       (boil)      [aw]       (awe)\n  [long a]  (mate)       [short u]  (but)",
        "  “The sounds at the beginning of this scale are especially fitted to\n  express uncontrollable joy and delight, gayety, triviality, rapid\n  movement, brightness, delicacy, and physical littleness; the sounds\n  at the end are peculiarly adapted to express horror, solemnity, awe,\n  deep grief, slowness of motion, darkness, and extreme or oppressive\n  greatness of size. The scale runs, then, from the little to the\n  large, from the bright to the dark, from ecstatic delight to horror,\n  and from the trivial to the solemn and awful.”",
        "Robert Louis Stevenson in his Some Technical Elements of Style in\nLiterature, and many other curious searchers into the secrets of words,\nhave attempted to explain the physiological basis of these varying\n\"tone-qualities.” Some of them are obviously imitative of sounds in\nnature; some are merely suggestive of these sounds through more or less\nremote analogies; some are frankly imitative of muscular effort or of\nmuscular relaxation. High-pitched vowels and low-pitched vowels, liquid\nconsonants and harsh consonants, are unquestionably associated with\nmuscular memories, that is to say, with individual body-and-mind\nexperiences. Lines like Tennyson’s famous",
        "  “The moan of doves in immemorial elms\n   And murmuring of innumerable bees”",
        "thus represent, in their vowel and consonantal expressiveness, the past\nhistory of countless physical sensations, widely shared by innumerable\nindividuals, and it is to this fact that the “transmission value” of the\nlines is due.",
        "Imitative effects are easily recognized, and need no comment:",
        "  “Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings”",
        "  “The mellow ouzel fluting in the elm”",
        "  “The wind that’ll wail like a child\n          and the sea that’ll moan like a man.”",
        "Suggestive effects are more subtle. Sometimes they are due primarily to\nthose rhythmical arrangements of words which we shall discuss in the next\nchapter, but poetry often employs the sound of single words to awaken dim\nor bright associations. Robert Bridges’s catalogue of the Greek nymphs in\n\"Eros and Psyche” is an extreme example of risking the total effect of a\nstanza upon the mere beautiful sounds of proper names.",
        "  “Swift to her wish came swimming on the waves\n  His lovely ocean nymphs, her guides to be,\n  The Nereids all, who live among the caves\n  And valleys of the deep, Cymodocè,\n  Agavè, blue-eyed Hallia and Nesaea,\n  Speio, and Thoë, Glaucè and Actaea,\n  Iaira, Melitè and Amphinomè,\n  Apseudès and Nemertès, Callianassa,\n  Cymothoë, Thaleia, Limnorrhea,\n  Clymenè, Ianeira and Ianassa,\n  Doris and Panopè and Galatea,\n  Dynamenè, Dexamenè and Maira,\n  Ferusa, Doto, Proto, Callianeira,\n  Amphithoë, Oreithuia and Amathea.”",
        "Names of objects like “bobolink” and “raven” may affect us emotionally by\nthe quality of their tone. Through association with the sounds of the\nhuman voice, heard under stress of various emotions, we attribute joyous\nor foreboding qualities to the bird’s tone, and then transfer these\nassociations to the bare name of the bird.",
        "Names of places are notoriously rich in their evocation of emotion.",
        "  “He caught a chill in the lagoons of Venice,\n  And died in Padua.”",
        "Here the fact of illness and death may be prosaic enough, but the very\nnames of “Venice” and “Padua” are poetry–like “Rome,” “Ireland,\"\n\"Arabia,” “California.”",
        "  “Where the great Vision of the guarded mount\n  Looks toward Namancos and Bayona’s hold.”",
        "Who knows precisely where that “guarded mount” is upon the map? And who\ncares? “The sailor’s heart,” confesses Lincoln Colcord,\n[Footnote: The New Republic, September 16, 1916.]\n\"refutes the prose of knowledge, and still believes in delectable and\nsounding names. He dreams of capes and islands whose appellations are\nmusic and a song.... The first big land sighted on the outward passage is\nJava Head; beside it stands Cape Sangian Sira, with its name like a\nbattle-cry. We are in the Straits of Sunda: name charged with the heady\nlanguor of the Orient, bringing to mind pictures of palm-fringed shores\nand native villages, of the dark-skinned men of Java clad in bright\nsarongs, clamoring from their black-painted dugouts, selling fruit and\nbrilliant birds. These waters are rich in names that stir the blood, like\nKrakatoa, Gunong Delam, or Lambuan; or finer, more sounding than all the\nrest, Telok Betong and Rajah Bassa, a town and a mountain–Telok Betong at\nthe head of Lampong Bay and Rajah Bassa, grand old bulwark on the Sumatra\nshore, the cradle of fierce and sudden squalls.”",
        "It may be urged, of course, that in lines of true poetry the sense carries\nthe sound with it, and that nothing is gained by trying to analyse the\nsounds apart from the sense. Professor C. M. Lewis\n[Footnote: Principles of English Verse. New York, 1906.]\nasserts bluntly: “When you say Titan you mean something big, and when you\nsay tittle you mean something small; but it is not the sound of either\nword that means either bigness or littleness, it is the sense. If you put\ntogether a great many similar consonants in one sentence, they will\nattract special attention to the words in which they occur, and the\nsignificance of those words, whatever it may be, is thereby intensified;\nbut whether the words are ’a team of little atomies’ or ’a triumphant\nterrible Titan,’ it is not the sound of the consonants that makes the\nsignificance. When Tennyson speaks of the shrill-edged shriek of\na mother, his words suggest with peculiar vividness the idea of a shriek;\nbut when you speak of stars that shyly shimmer, the same sounds only\nintensify the idea of shy shimmering.” This is refreshing, and yet it is\nto be noted that “Titan” and “tittle” and “shrill-edged shriek” and “shyly\nshimmer” are by no means identical in sound: they have merely certain\nconsonants in common. A fairer test of tone-color may be found if we turn\nto frank nonsense-verse, where the formal elements of poetry surely exist\nwithout any control of meaning or “sense”:",
        "  “The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,\n   Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,\n   And burbled as it came!",
        "  “’T was brillig, and the slithy toves\n     Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;\n  All mimsy were the borogoves,\n    And the mome raths outgrabe.”",
        "  “It seems rather pretty,” commented the wise Alice, “but it’s rather\n  hard to understand! Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas–only\n  I don’t exactly know what they are!”",
        "This is precisely what one feels when one listens to a poem recited in a\nlanguage of which one happens to be ignorant. The wonderful colored words\nare there, and they seem somehow to fill our heads with ideas, only we do\nnot know what they are. Many readers who know a little Italian or German\nwill confess that their enjoyment of a lyric in those languages suffers\nonly a slight, if any, impairment through their ignorance of the precise\nmeaning of all the words in the poem: if they know enough to feel the\npredominant mood–as when we listen to a song sung in a language of which\nwe are wholly ignorant–we can sacrifice the succession of exact ideas.\nFor words bare of meaning to the intellect may be covered with veils of\nemotional association due to the sound alone. Garrick ridiculed–and\ndoubtless at the same time envied–George Whitefield’s power to make women\nweep by the rich overtones with which he pronounced “that blessed word\nMesopotamia.”",
        "The capacities and the limitations of tone-quality in itself may be seen\nno less clearly in parodies. Swinburne, a master technician in words and\nrhythm, occasionally delighted, as in “Nephelidia,\"\n[Footnote: Quoted in Carolyn Wells, A Parody Anthology. New York, 1904.]\nto make fun of himself as well as of his poetic contemporaries:",
        "  “Surely no spirit or sense of a soul that was soft\n          to the spirit and soul of our senses\n    Sweetens the stress of surprising suspicion that\n          sobs in the semblance and sound of a sigh;\n  Only this oracle opens Olympian, in mystical\n          moods and triangular tenses,–\n    ’Life is the lust of a lamp for the light that is\n          dark till the dawn of the day when we die.’”",
        "Or, take Calverley’s parody of Robert Browning:",
        "  “You see this pebble-stone? It’s a thing I bought\n  Of a bit of a chit of a boy i’ the mid o’ the day.\n  I like to dock the smaller parts o’ speech,\n  As we curtail the already cur-tail’d cur–”",
        "The characteristic tone-quality of the vocabulary of each of these\npoets–whether it be",
        "  “A soul that was soft to the spirit and soul of our senses”",
        "or",
        "  “A bit of a chit of a boy i’ the mid o’ the day\"–",
        "is as perfectly conveyed by the parodist as if the lines had been written\nin dead earnest. Poe’s “Ulalume” is a masterly display of tone-color\ntechnique, but exactly what it means, or whether it means anything at all,\nis a matter upon which critics have never been able to agree. It is\ncertain, however, that a poet’s words possess a kind of physical\nsuggestiveness, more or less closely related to their mental significance.\nIn nonsense-verse and parodies we have a glimpse, as it were, at the body\nof poetry stripped of its soul.",
        "7. “Figures of Speech”\nTo understand why poets habitually use figurative language, we must recall\nwhat has been said in Chapter III about verbal images. Under the heat and\npressure of emotion, things alter their shape and size and quality, ideas\nare transformed into concrete images, diction becomes impassioned, plain\nspeech tends to become metaphorical. The language of any excited person,\nwhether he is uttering himself in prose or verse, is marked by “tropes\";\ni.e. “turnings\"–images which express one thing in the terms of another\nthing. The language of feeling is characteristically “tropical,” and\nindeed every man who uses metaphors is for the moment talking like a\npoet–unless, as too often happens both in prose and verse, the metaphor\nhas become conventionalized and therefore lifeless. The born poet\nthinks in “figures,” in “pictured\" language, or, as it has been called, in\n\"re-presentative\" language,\n[Footnote: G. L. Raymond, Poetry as a Representative Art, chap. 19.]\nsince he represents, both to his own mind and to those with whom he is\ncommunicating, the objects of poetic emotion under new forms. If he wishes\nto describe an eagle, he need not say: “A rapacious bird of the falcon\nfamily, remarkable for its strength, size, graceful figure, and\nextraordinary flight.” He represents these facts by making a picture:",
        "  “He clasps the crag with crooked hands;\n  Close to the sun in lonely lands,\n  Ring’d with the azure world, he stands.",

        "Or suppose the poet is a woman, meditating upon the coming of old age, and\nreflecting that age brings riches of its own. Observe how this thought is\n\"troped\"; i.e. turned into figures which re-present the fundamental idea:",
        "  “Come, Captain Age,\n  With your great sea-chest full of treasure!\n  Under the yellow and wrinkled tarpaulin\n  Disclose the carved ivory\n  And the sandalwood inlaid with pearl,\n  Riches of wisdom and years.\n  Unfold the India shawl,\n  With the border of emerald and orange and crimson and blue,\n  Weave of a lifetime.\n  I shall be warm and splendid\n  With the spoils of the Indies of age.\"\n[Footnote: Sarah N. Cleghorn, “Come, Captain Age.\"]",
        "It is true, of course, that a poet may sometimes prefer to use\nunornamented language, “not elevated,” as Wordsworth said, “above the\nlevel of prose.” Such passages may nevertheless be marked by poetic\nbeauty, due to the circumstances or atmosphere in which the plain words\nare spoken. The drama is full of such instances. “I loved you not,” says\nHamlet; to which Ophelia replies only: “I was the more deceived.” No\nfigure of speech could be more moving than that.",

        "I had read the lines often enough in books, but here I realized for the\nfirst time the perfection of their beauty.",
        "But though a poet, for special reasons, may now and then renounce the use\nof figurative language, it remains true that this is the characteristic\nand habitual mode of utterance, not only of poetry but of all emotional\nprose. Here are a few sentences from an English sailor’s account of the\nfight off Heligoland on August 28, 1915. He was on a destroyer:",
        "  “Scarcely had we started when from out the mist and across our front,\n  in furious pursuit, came the first cruiser squadron–the town class,\n  Birmingham, etc.–each unit a match for three Mainzes; and as we\n  looked and reduced speed they opened fire, and the clear\n  ’bang-bang!’ of their guns was just a cooling drink....",
        "  “The Mainz was immensely gallant. The last I saw of her, absolutely\n  wrecked alow and aloft, her whole midships a fuming inferno, she had\n  one gun forward and one aft still spitting forth fury and defiance\n  like a wildcat mad with wounds.",
        "  “Our own four-funnel friend recommenced at this juncture with a\n  couple of salvos, but rather half-heartedly, and we really did not\n  care a d––, for there, straight ahead of us, in lordly procession,\n  like elephants walking through a pack of dogs, came the Lion, Queen\n  Mary, Invincible, and New Zealand, our battle cruisers, great and\n  grim and uncouth as some antediluvian monsters. How solid they\n  looked! How utterly earthquaking!”",
        "The use and the effectiveness of figures depend primarily, then, upon the\nmood and intentions of the writer. Figures are figures, whether employed\nin prose or verse. Mr. Kipling does not lose his capacity for employing\nmetaphors as he turns from writing verse to writing stories, and the\nrhetorician’s analysis of similes, personifications,  allegories, and all\nthe other devices of “tropical\" language is precisely the same, whether he\nis studying poetry or prose. Any good textbook in rhetoric gives adequate\nexamples of these various classes of figures, and they need not be\nrepeated here.",
        "8. Words as Permanent Embodiment of Poetic Feeling\nWe have seen that the characteristic vocabulary of poetry originates in\nemotion and that it is capable of transmitting emotion to the hearer or\nreader. But how far are words capable of embodying emotion in permanent\nform? Poets themselves, in proud consciousness of the enduring character\nof their creations, have often boasted that they were building monuments\nmore enduring than bronze or marble. When Shakspere asserts this in his\nsonnets, he is following not only an Elizabethan convention, but a\nuniversal instinct of the men of his craft. Is it a delusion? Here are\nwords–mere vibrating sounds, light and winged and evanescent things,\nassuming a meaning value only through the common consent of those who\ninterchange them, altering that meaning more or less from year to year,\noften passing wholly from the living speech of men, decaying when races\ndecay and civilizations change. What transiency, what waste and oblivion\nlike that which waits upon millions on millions of autumn leaves!",
        "Yet nothing in human history is more indisputable than the fact that\ncertain passages of poetry do survive, age after age, while empires pass,\nand philosophies change and science alters the mental attitude of men as\nwell as the outward circumstances of life upon this planet.",
        "Some thoughts and feelings, then, eternalize themselves in human speech;\nmost thoughts and feelings do not. Wherein lies the difference?\nIf most words are perishable stuff, what is it that keeps other words from\nperishing? Is it superior organization and arrangement of this fragile\nmaterial, “fame’s great antiseptic, style”? Or is it by virtue of some\nsecret passionate quality imparted to words by the poet, so that the\napparently familiar syllables take on a life and significance which is\nreally not their own, but his? And is this intimate personalized quality\nof words “style,” also, as well as that more external “style” revealed in\nclear and orderly and idiomatic arrangement? Or does the mystery of\npermanence reside in the poet’s generalizing power, by which he is able to\nexpress universal, and hence permanently interesting human experience? And\ntherefore, was not the late Professor Courthope right when he declared, “I\ntake all great poetry to be not so much what Plato thought it, the\nutterance of individual genius, half inspired, half insane, as the\nenduring voice of the soul and conscience of man living in society”?",
        "Answers to such questions as these depend somewhat upon the “romantic” or\n\"classic” bias of the critics. Romantic criticism tends to stress the\nsignificance of the personality of the individual poet. The classic school\nof criticism tends to emphasize the more general and universal qualities\nrevealed by the poet’s work. But while the schools and  fashions of\ncriticism shift their ground and alter their verdicts as succeeding\ngenerations change in taste, the great poets continue as before to\nparticularize and also to generalize, to be “romantic” and “classic” by\nturns, or even in the same poem. They defy critical augury, in their\nunending quest of beauty and truth. That they succeed, now and then, in\ngiving a permanently lovely embodiment to their vision is surely a more\nimportant fact than the rightness or wrongness of whatever artistic theory\nthey may have invoked or followed.",
        "For many a time, surely, their triumphs are a contradiction of their\ntheories. To take a very familiar example, Wordsworth’s theory of poetic\ndiction shifted like a weathercock. In the Advertisement to the Lyrical\nBallads (1798) he asserted: “The following poems are to be considered as\nexperiments. They were written chiefly with a view to ascertain how far\nthe language of conversation in the middle and lower classes of society is\nadapted to the purposes of poetic pleasure.” In the Preface of the second\nedition (1800) he announced that his purpose had been “to ascertain how\nfar, by fitting to metrical arrangement a selection of the real language\nof men in a state of vivid sensation, that sort of pleasure and that\nquantity of pleasure may be imparted, which a poet may rationally\nendeavour to impart.” But in the famous remarks on poetic diction which\naccompanied the third edition (1802) he inserted after the words “A\nselection of language really used by men” this additional statement of his\nintention: “And at the same time to throw over them a certain colouring of\nthe imagination whereby ordinary things should be presented to the mind in\nan unusual aspect.” In place of the original statement about the\nconversation of the middle and lower classes of society, we are now\nassured that the language of poetry “if selected truly and judiciously,\nmust necessarily be dignified and variegated and alive with metaphors and\nfigures.... This selection will form a distinction ... and will entirely\nseparate the composition from the vulgarity and meanness of ordinary\nlife.”",
        "What an amazing change in theory in four years! Yet it is no more\nremarkable than Wordsworth’s successive emendations in the text of his\npoems. In 1807 his blind Highland boy had gone voyaging in",
        "  “A Household Tub, like one of those\n   Which women use to wash their clothes;\n     This carried the blind Boy.”",
        "In 1815 the wash-tub becomes",
        "  “The shell of a green turtle, thin\n   And hollow–you might sit therein,\n     It was so wide and deep.”",
        "And in 1820 the worried and dissatisfied artist changes that unlucky\nvessel once more into the final banality of",
        "  “A shell of ample size, and light\n   As the pearly car of Amphitrite\n     That sportive dolphins drew.”",
        "Sometimes, it is true, this adventurer in poetic diction had rather better\nfortune in his alterations. The much-ridiculed lines of 1798 about the\nchild’s grave–",
        "  “I’ve measured it from side to side,\n   ’T is three feet long and two feet wide\"–",
        "became in 1820:",
        "  “Though but of compass small and bare\n   To thirsty suns and parching air.”",
        "Like his friend Coleridge, Wordsworth forsook gradually his early\nexperiments with matter-of-fact phrases, with quaintly grotesque figures.\nRevolt against conventional eighteenth-century diction had given him a\nblessed sense of freedom, but he found his real strength later in subduing\nthat freedom to a sense of law. Archaisms, queernesses, flatly\nnaturalistic turns of speech gave place to a vocabulary of simple dignity\nand austere beauty. Wordsworth attained his highest originality as an\nartist by disregarding singularity, by making familiar words reveal new\npotencies of expression.",
        "For after all, we must come back to what William James called the long\n\"loop-line,” to that reservoir of ideas and feelings which stores up the\nexperience of individuals and of the race, and to the words which most\neffectively evoke that experience. Two classes at Columbia University, a\nfew years ago, were asked to select fifty English words of basic\nimportance in the expression of human life. In choosing these words, they\nwere to aim at reality and strength rather than at beauty. When the two\nlists were combined, they presented these seventy-eight different words,\nwhich are here arranged alphabetically: age, ambition, beauty, bloom,\ncountry, courage, dawn, day, death, despair, destiny, devotion, dirge,\ndisaster, divine, dream, earth, enchantment, eternity, fair, faith,\nfantasy, flower, fortune, freedom, friendship, glory, glow, god, grief,\nhappiness, harmony, hate, heart, heaven, honor, hope, immortality, joy,\njustice, knell, life, longing, love, man, melancholy, melody, mercy, moon,\nmortal, nature, noble, night, paradise, parting, peace, pleasure, pride,\nregret, sea, sigh, sleep, solitude, song, sorrow, soul, spirit, spring,\nstar, suffer, tears, tender, time, virtue, weep, whisper, wind and youth.\n[Footnote: See Nation, February 23, 1911.]",
        "Surely these words, selected as they were for their significance, are not\nlacking in beauty of sound. On the contrary, any list of the most\nbeautiful words in English would include many of them. But it is the\nmeaning of these “long-loop” words, rather than their formal beauty alone,\nwhich fits them for the service of poetry. And they acquire in that\nservice a “literary\" value, which is subtly blended with their “sound\"\nvalue and logical “meaning\" value. They connote so much! They suggest more\nthan they actually say. They unite the individual mood of the moment with\nthe soul of mankind.",
        "And there is still another mode of union between the individual and the\nrace, which we must attempt in the next chapter to regard more closely,\nbut which should be mentioned here in connection with the permanent\nembodiment of feeling in words,–namely, the mysterious fact of rhythm.\nSingle words are born and die, we learn them and forget them, they alter\ntheir meanings, they always say less than we really intend, they are\nimperfect instruments for signaling from one brain to another. Yet these\ncrumbling particles of speech may be miraculously held together and built\ninto a tune, and with the tune comes another element of law, order,\npermanence. The instinct for the drumbeat lies deep down in our bodies; it\naffects our mental life, the organization of our emotions, and our\nresponse to the rhythmical arrangement of words. For mere ideas and words\nare not poetry, but only part of the material for poetry. A poem does not\ncome into full being until the words begin to dance.",
        "RHYTHM AND METRE",
        "  “Rhythm is the recurrence of stress at intervals; metre is the\n  regular, or measured, recurrence of stress.\"\n    M. H. SHACKFORD, A First Book of Poetics\n  “Metres being manifestly sections of rhythm.\"\n    ARISTOTLE, Poetics, 4. (Butcher’s translation)",
        "  “Thoughts that voluntary move\n  Harmonious numbers.\"\n    MILTON",
        "1. The Nature of Rhythm\nAnd why must the words begin to dance? The answer is to be perceived in\nthe very nature of Rhythm, that old name for the ceaseless pulsing or\n\"flowing” of all living things. So deep indeed lies the instinct for\nrhythm in our consciousness that we impute it even to inanimate objects.\nWe hear the ticking of the clock as tíck-tock, tíck-tock, or else\ntick-tóck, tick-tóck, although psychologists assure us that the clock’s\nwheels are moving with indifferent, mechanical precision, and that it is\nsimply our own focusing of attention upon alternate beats which creates\nthe impression of rhythm. We hear a rhythm in the wheels of the train, and\nin the purring of the motor-engine, knowing all the while that it\nis we who impose or make-up the rhythm, in our human instinct for\norganizing the units of attention. We cannot help it, as long as our own\npulses beat. No two persons catch quite the same rhythm in the sounds of\nthe animate and inanimate world, because no two persons have absolutely\nidentical pulse-beats, identical powers of attention, an identical\npsycho-physical organism. We all perceive that there is a rhythm in a\nracing crew, in a perfectly timed stroke of golf, in a fisherman’s fly-\ncasting, in a violinist’s bow, in a close-hauled sailboat fighting with\nthe wind. But we appropriate and organize these objective impressions in\nsubtly different ways.",
        "When, for instance, we listen to poetry read aloud, or when we read it\naloud ourselves, some of us are instinctive “timers,\"\n[Footnote: See W. M. Patterson, The Rhythm of Prose. Columbia University\nPress, 1916.]\npaying primary attention to the spaced or measured intervals of time,\nalthough in so doing we are not wholly regardless of those points of\n\"stress” which help to make the time-intervals plainer. Others of us are\nnatural “stressers,” in that we pay primary attention to the “weight” of\nwords,–the relative loudness or pitch, by which their meaning or\nimportance is indicated,–and it is only secondarily that we think of\nthese weighted or “stressed” words as separated from one another by\napproximately equal intervals of time. Standing on the rocks at Gloucester\nafter an easterly storm, a typical “timer” might be chiefly conscious of\nthe steady sequence of the waves, the measured intervals between\ntheir summits; while the typical stresser, although subconsciously aware\nof the steady iteration of the giant rollers, might watch primarily their\nfoaming crests, and listen chiefly to their crashing thunder. The point to\nbe remembered is this: that neither the “timing” instinct nor the\n\"stressing” instinct excludes the other, although in most individuals one\nor the other predominates. Musicians, for instance, are apt to be\nnoticeable “timers,” while many scholars who deal habitually with words in\ntheir varied shifts of meaning, are professionally inclined to be\n\"stressers.”",
        "2. The Measurement of Rhythm\nLet us apply these facts to some of the more simple of the vexed questions\nof prosody, No one disputes the universality of the rhythmizing impulse;\nthe quarrel begins as soon as any prosodist attempts to dogmatize about\nthe nature and measurement of those flowing time-intervals whose\narrangement we call rhythm. No one disputes, again, that the only arbiter\nin matters of prosody is the trained ear, and not the eye. Infinitely\ndeceptive is the printed page of verse when regarded by the eye. Verse may\nbe made to look like prose and prose to look like verse. Capital letters,\nlines, rhymes, phrases and paragraphs may be so cunningly or\nconventionally arranged by the printer as to disguise the real nature of\nthe rhythmical and metrical pattern. When in doubt, close your eyes!",
        "We agree, then, that in all spoken language–and this is as true of prose\nas it is of verse–there are time-intervals more or less clearly marked,\nand that the ear is the final judge as to the nature of these intervals.\nBut can the ear really measure the intervals with any approximation to\ncertainty, so that prosodists, for instance, can agree that a given poem\nis written in a definite metre? In one sense “yes.” No one doubts that the\nOdyssey is written in “dactylic hexameters,” i.e., in lines made up of\nsix “feet,” each one of which is normally composed of a long syllable plus\ntwo short syllables, or of an acceptable equivalent for that particular\ncombination. But when we are taught in school that Longfellow’s\nEvangeline is also written in “dactylic hexameters,” trouble begins for\nthe few inquisitive, since it is certain that if you close your eyes and\nlisten carefully to a dozen lines of Homer’s Greek, and then to a\ndozen lines of Longfellow’s English, each written in so-called\n\"hexameters,” you are listening to two very different arrangements of\ntime-intervals, so different, in fact, that the two poems are really not\nin the same “measure” or “metre” at all. For the Greek poet was, as a\nmetrist, thinking primarily of quantity, of the relative “timing” of his\nsyllables, and the American of the relative “stress” of his syllables.\n[Footnote: “Musically speaking–because the musical terms are exact and\nnot ambiguous–true dactyls are in 2-4 time and the verse of Evangelineis in 3-8 time.” T. D. Goodell, Nation, October 12, 1911.]",
        "That illustration is drearily hackneyed, no doubt, but it has a double\nvalue. It is perfectly clear; and furthermore, it serves to remind us of\nthe instinctive differences between different persons and different races\nas regards the ways of arranging time-intervals so as to create the\nrhythms of verse. The individual’s standard of measurement–his poetic\nfoot-rule, so to speak–is very elastic,–\"made of rubber” indeed, as the\nexperiments of many psychological laboratories have demonstrated beyond a\nquestion. Furthermore, the composers of poetry build it out of very\nelastic units. They are simply putting syllables of words together into a\nrhythmical design, and these “airy syllables,” in themselves mere symbols\nof ideas and feelings, cannot be weighed by any absolutely correct\nsound-scales. They cannot be measured in time by any absolutely accurate\nwatch-dial, or exactly estimated in their meaning, whether that be literal\nor figurative, by any dictionary of words and phrases. But this is only\nsaying that the syllables which make up the units of verse, whether the\nunits be called “foot” or “line” or “phrase,” are not dead, mechanical\nthings, but live things, moving rhythmically, entering thereby into the\npulsing, chiming life of the real world, and taking on more fullness of\nlife and beauty in elastic movement, in ordered but infinitely flexible\ndesign, than they ever could possess as independent particles.",
        "3. Conflict and Compromise\nAnd everywhere in the arrangement of syllables into the patterns of rhythm\nand metre we find conflict and compromise, the surrender of some values of\nsound or sense for the sake of a greater unity. To revert to\nconsiderations dealt with in an earlier chapter, we touch here upon the\nold antinomy–or it may be, harmony–between “form” and “significance,\"\nbetween the “outside” and the “inside” of the work of art. For words,\nsurely, have one kind of value as pure sound, as “cadences” made up of\nstresses, slides, pauses, and even of silences when the expected syllable\nis artfully withheld. It is this sound-value, for instance, which you\nperceive as you listen to a beautifully recited poem in Russian, a\nlanguage of which you know not a single word; and you may experience a\nmodification of the same pleasure in closing your mind wholly to the\n\"sense” of a richly musical passage in Swinburne, and delighting your ear\nby its mere beauty of tone. But words have also that other value as\nmeaning, and we are aware how these meaning values shift with the stress\nand turns of thought, so that a given word has a greater or less weight in\ndifferent sentences or even in different clauses of the same sentence.\n\"Meaning\" values, like sound values, are never precisely fixed in a\nmechanical and universally agreed-upon scale, they are relative, not\nabsolute. Sometimes meaning and sound conflict with one another, and one\nmust be sacrificed in part, as when the normal accent of a word\nrefuses to coincide with the verse-accent demanded by a certain measure,\nso that we “wrench” the accent a trifle, or make it “hover” over two\nsyllables without really alighting upon either. And it is significant that\nlovers of poetry have always found pleasure in such compromises.\n[Footnote: Compare the passage about Chopin’s piano-playing, quoted from\nAlden in the Notes and Illustrations for this chapter.]\nThey enjoy minor departures from and returns to the normal, the expected\nmeasure of both sound and sense, just as a man likes to sail a boat as\nclosely into the wind as he conveniently can, making his actual course a\ncompromise between the line as laid by the compass, and the actual facts\nof wind and tide and the behavior of his particular boat. It is thus that\nthe sailor “makes it,” triumphantly! And the poet “makes it” likewise, out\nof deep, strong-running tides of rhythmic impulse, out of arbitrary words\nand rebellious moods, out of",
        "  “Thoughts hardly to be packed\n  Into a narrow act,\n  Fancies that broke through language and escaped,”",
        "until he compels rhythm and syllables to move concordantly, and blend into\nthat larger living whole–the dancing, singing crowd of sounds and\nmeanings which make up a poem.",
        "4. The Rhythms of Prose\nJust here it may be of help to us to turn away for a moment from verse\nrhythm, and to consider what Dryden called “the other harmony” of prose.\nFor no one doubts that prose has rhythm, as well as verse. Vast and\nlearned treatises have been written on the prose rhythms of the Greeks and\nRomans, and Saintsbury’s History of English Prose Rhythm is a monumental\ncollection of wonderful prose passages in English, with the scansion of\n\"long” and “short” syllables and of “feet” marked after a fashion that\nseems to please no one but the author. But in truth the task of inventing\nan adequate system for notating the rhythm of prose, and securing a\nworking agreement among prosodists as to a proper terminology, is almost\ninsuperable. Those of us who sat in our youth at the feet of German\nmasters were taught that the distinction between verse and prose was\nsimple: verse was, as the Greeks had called it, “bound speech” and prose\nwas “loosened speech.” But a large proportion of the poetry published in\nthe last ten years is “free verse,” which is assuredly of a “loosened\"\nrather than a “bound” pattern.",
        "Apparently the old fence between prose and verse has been broken down. Or,\nif one conceives of indubitable prose and indubitable verse as forming two\nintersecting circles, there is a neutral zone,",
        "[Illustration:   Prose  /  Neutral Zone  /  Verse]",
        "which some would call “prose poetry” and some “free verse,” and which,\naccording to the experiments of Dr. Patterson\n[Footnote: The Rhythm of Prose, already cited.]\nmay be appropriated as “prose experience” or “verse experience” according\nto the rhythmic instinct of each individual. Indeed Mr. T. S. Omond has\nadmitted that “the very same words, with the very same natural stresses,\nmay be prose or verse according as we treat them. The difference is in\nourselves, in the mental rhythm to which we unconsciously adjust the\nwords.\"\n[Footnote: Quoted in B. M. Alden, “The Mental Side of Metrical Form,\"\nModern Language Review, July, 1914.]\nMany familiar sentences from the English Bible or Prayer-Book, such as the\nwords from the Te Deum, “We, therefore, pray thee, help thy servants,\nwhom thou hast redeemed with thy precious blood,” have a rhythm which may\nbe felt as prose or verse, according to the mental habit or mood or\nrhythmizing impulse of the hearer.",
        "Nevertheless it remains true in general that the rhythms of prose are more\nconstantly varied, broken and intricate than the rhythms of verse. They\nare characterized, according to the interesting experiments of Dr.\nPatterson, by syncopated time,\n[Footnote: “For a ’timer’ the definition of prose as distinguished from\nverse experience depends upon a predominance of syncopation over\ncoincidence in the coordination of the accented syllables of the text with\nthe measuring pulses.” Rhythm of Prose, p. 22.]\nwhereas in normal verse there is a fairly clean-cut coincidence between\nthe pulses of the hearer and the strokes of the rhythm. Every one seems to\nagree that there is a certain danger in mixing these infinitely subtle and\n\"syncopated” tunes of prose with the easily recognized tunes of verse.\nThere is, unquestionably, a natural “iambic” roll in English prose, due to\nthe predominant alternation of stressed and unstressed syllables in our\nnative tongue, but when Dickens–to cite what John Wesley would call “an\neminent sinner” in this respect–inserts in his emotional prose line after\nline of five-stress “iambic” verse, we feel instinctively that the\npresence of the blank verse impairs the true harmony of the prose.\n[Footnote:  Observe, in the “Notes and Illustrations” for this chapter,\nthe frequency of the blank-verse lines in Robert G. Ingersoll’s “Address\nover a Little Boy’s Grave.\"]\nDelicate writers of English prose usually avoid this coincidence of\npattern with the more familiar patterns of verse, but it is impossible to\navoid it wholly, and some of the most beautiful cadences of English prose\nmight, if detached from their context, be scanned for a few syllables as\nperfect verse. The free verse of Whitman, Henley and Matthew Arnold is\nfull of these embedded fragments of recognized “tunes of verse,” mingled\nwith the unidentifiable tunes of prose. There has seldom been a more\ncurious example of accidental coincidence than in this sentence from a\nprosaic textbook on “The Parallelogram of Forces”: “And hence no force,\nhowever great, can draw a cord, however fine, into a horizontal line which\nshall be absolutely straight.” This is precisely the “four-stressed\niambic” metre of In Memoriam, and it even preserves the peculiar rhyme\norder of the In Memoriam stanza:",
        "  “And hence no force, however great,\n    Can draw a cord, however fine,\n    Into a horizontal line\n  Which shall be absolutely straight.”",
        "We shall consider more closely, in the section on Free Verse in the\nfollowing chapter, this question of the coincidence and variation of\npattern as certain types of loosened verse pass in and out of the zone\nwhich is commonly recognized as pure prose. But it is highly important\nhere to remember another fact, which professional psychologists in their\nlaboratory experiments with the notation of verse and prose have\nfrequently forgotten, namely, the existence of a type of ornamented prose,\nwhich has had a marked historical influence upon the development of\nEnglish style. This ornamented prose, elaborated by Greek and Roman\nrhetoricians, and constantly apparent in the pages of Cicero, heightened\nits rhythm by various devices of alliteration, assonance, tone-color,\ncadence, phrase and period. Greek oratory even employed rhyme in highly\ncolored passages, precisely as Miss Amy Lowell uses rhyme in her\npolyphonic or “many-voiced” prose. Medieval Latin took over all of these\ndevices from Classical Latin, and in its varied oratorical, liturgical and\nepistolary forms it strove to imitate the various modes of cursus(\"running”) and clausula (\"cadence”) which had characterized the rhythms\nof Isocrates and Cicero.\n[Footnote: A. C. Clark, Prose Rhythm in English. Oxford, 1913.\nMorris W. Croll, “The Cadence of English Oratorical Prose,” Studies in\nPhilology. January, 1919.\nOliver W. Elton, “English Prose Numbers,” in Essays and Studies by\nmembers of the English Association, 4th Series. Oxford, 1913.]\nFrom the Medieval Latin Missal and Breviary these devices of prose rhythm,\nparticularly those affecting the end of sentences, were taken over into\nthe Collects and other parts of the liturgy of the English Prayer-Book.\nThey had a constant influence upon the rhythms employed by the translators\nof the English Bible, and through the Bible the cadences of this ancient\nornamented prose have passed over into the familiar but intricate\nharmonies of our “heightened” modern prose.",
        "While this whole matter is too technical to be dealt with adequately here,\nit may serve at least to remind the reader that an appreciation of English\nprose rhythms, as they have been actually employed for many centuries,\nrequires a sensitiveness to the rhetorical position of phrases and\nclauses, and to “the use of sonorous words in the places of rhetorical\nemphasis, which cannot be indicated by the bare symbols of prosody.\"\n[Footnote: New York Nation, February 27, 1913.]\nFor that sonority and cadence and balance which constitute a harmonious\nprose sentence cannot be adequately felt by a possibly illiterate\nscientist in his laboratory for acoustics; the “literary\" value of words,\nin all strongly emotional prose, is inextricably mingled with the bare\nsound values: it is thought-units that must be delicately “balanced” as\nwell as stresses and slides and final clauses; it is the elevation of\nideas, the nobility and beauty of feeling, as discerned by the trained\nliterary sense, which makes the final difference between enduring prose\nharmonies and the mere tinkling of the “musical glasses.\"\n[Footnote: This point is suggestively discussed by C. E. Andrews,\nThe Writing and Reading of Verse, chap. 5. New York, 1918.]\nThe student of verse may very profitably continue to exercise himself with\nthe rhythms of prose. He should learn to share the unwearied enthusiasm of\nProfessor Saintsbury for the splendid cadences of our sixteenth-century\nEnglish, for the florid decorative period of Thomas Browne and Jeremy\nTaylor, for the eloquent “prose poetry” of De Quincey and Ruskin and\nCharles Kingsley, and for the strangely subtle effects wrought by Pater\nand Stevenson. But he must not imagine that any laboratory system of\ntapping syncopated time, or any painstaking marking of macrons (-) breves\n(u) and caesuras (||) will give him full initiation into the mysteries of\nprose cadences which have been built, not merely out of stressed and\nunstressed syllables, but out of the passionate intellectual life of many\ngenerations of men. He may learn to feel that life as it pulsates in\nwords, but no one has thus far devised an adequate scheme for its\nnotation.",
        "5. Quantity, Stress and Syllable\nThe notation of verse, however, while certainly not a wholly simple\nmatter, is far easier. It is practicable to indicate by conventional\nprinter’s devices the general rhythmical and metrical scheme of a poem,\nand to indicate the more obvious, at least, of its incidental variations\nfrom the expected pattern. It remains as true of verse as it is of prose\nthat the “literary\" values of words–their connotations or emotional\novertones–are too subtle to be indicated by any marks invented by a\nprinter; but the alternation or succession of long or short syllables, of\nstressed or unstressed syllables, the nature of particular feet\nand lines and stanzas, the order and interlacing of rhymes, and even the\ndevices of tone-color, are sufficiently external elements of verse to\nallow easy methods of indication.",
        "When you and I first began to study Virgil and Horace, for instance, we\nwere taught that the Roman poets, imitating the Greeks, built heir verses\nupon the principle of Quantity. The metrical unit was the foot, made up\nof long and short syllables in various combinations, two short syllables\nbeing equivalent to one long one. The feet most commonly used were the\nIambus [short-long], the Anapest [short-short-long], the Trochee\n[long-short], the Dactyl [long-short-short], and the Spondee [long-long].\nThen we were instructed that a “verse” or line consisting of one foot was\ncalled a monometer, of two feet, a dimeter, of three, a trimeter, of four,\na tetrameter, of five, a pentameter, of six, a hexameter. This looked like\na fairly easy game, and before long we were marking the quantities in the\nfirst line of the Aeneid, as other school-children had done ever since the\ntime of St. Augustine:",
        " Arma vi¦rumque ca¦no  Tro¦jae qui ¦ primus ab¦oris.",
        "Or perhaps it was Horace’s",
        " Maece¦nas, atavis ¦¦ edite reg¦ibus.",
        "We were told, of course, that it was not all quite as simple as this: that\nthere were frequent metrical variations, such as trochees changing places\nwith dactyls, and anapests with iambi; that feet could be inverted, so\nthat a trochaic line might begin with an iambus, an anapestic line with a\ndactyl, or vice versa; that syllables might be omitted at the beginning\nor the end or even in the middle of a line, and that this “cutting-off\"\nwas called catalexis; that syllables might even be added at the\nbeginning or end of certain lines and that these syllables were called\nhypermetric; and that we must be very watchful about pauses,\nparticularly about a somewhat mysterious chief pause, liable to occur\nabout the middle of a line, called a caesura. But the magic password to\nadmit us to this unknown world of Greek and Roman prosody was after all\nthe word Quantity.",
        "If a few of us were bold enough to ask the main difference between this\nRoman system of versification and the system which governed modern English\npoetry–even such rude playground verse as",
        "  “Eeny, meeny, miny, mo,\n  Catch a nigger by the toe\"–",
        "we were promptly told by the teacher that the difference was a very plain\none, namely, that English, like all the Germanic languages, obeyed in its\nverse the principles of Stress. Instead of looking for “long” and\n\"short” syllables, we had merely to look for “stressed” and “unstressed\"\nsyllables. It was a matter, not of quantity, but of accent; and if we\nremembered this fact, there was no harm but rather a great convenience, in\nretaining the technical names of classical versification. Only we must be\ncareful that by “iambus,” in English poetry, we meant an unstressed\nsyllable, rather than a short syllable followed by a long one. And so with\n\"trochee,” “dactyl,” “anapest” and the rest; if we knew that accent and\nnot quantity was what we really had in mind, it was proper enough to speak\nof Paradise Lost as written in “iambic pentameter,” and Evangeline in\n\"dactylic hexameter,” etc. The trick was to count stresses and not\nsyllables, for was not Coleridge’s Christabel written in a metre which\nvaried its syllables anywhere from four to twelve for the line, yet\nmaintained its music by regularity of stress?",
        "Nothing could be plainer than all this. Yet some of us discovered when we\nwent to college and listened to instructors who grew strangely excited\nover prosody, that it was not all as easy as this distinction between\nQuantity and Stress would seem to indicate. For we were now told that\nthe Greek and Roman habits of daily speech in prose had something to do\nwith their instinctive choice of verse-rhythms: that at the very time when\nthe Greek heroic hexameters were being composed, there was a natural\ndactylic roll in spoken prose; that Roman daily speech had a stronger\nstress than Greek, so that Horace, in imitating Greek lyric measures, had\nstubborn natural word-accents to reconcile with his quantitative measures;\nthat the Roman poets, who had originally allowed normal word-accent and\nverse-pulse to coincide for the most part, came gradually to enjoy a\ncertain clash between them, keeping all the while the quantitative\nprinciple dominant; so that when Virgil and Horace read their verses\naloud, and word-accent and verse-pulse fell upon different syllables, the\nverse-pulse yielded slightly to the word-accent, thus adding something of\nthe charm of conversational prose to the normal time-values of the rhythm.\nIn a word, we were now taught–if I may quote from a personal letter of a\ndistinguished American Latinist–that “the almost universal belief that\nLatin verse is a matter of quantity only is a mistake. Word-accent was not\nlost in Latin verse.”",
        "And then, as if this undermining of our schoolboy faith in pure Quantity\nwere not enough, came the surprising information that the Romans had kept,\nperhaps from the beginning of their poetizing, a popular type of accented\nverse, as seen in the rude chant of the Roman legionaries,",
        " Mílle Fráncos mílle sémel Sármatás occídimús.\n[Footnote: See C. M. Lewis, Foreign Sources of Modern English\nVersification. Halle, 1898.]",
        "Certainly those sun-burnt “doughboys” were not bothering themselves\nabout trochees and iambi and such toys of cultivated “literary” persons;\nthey were amusing themselves on the march by inventing words to fit the\n\"goose-step.” Their",
        " Unus homo mille mille mille decollavimus\nwhich Professor Courthope scans as trochaic verse,\n[Footnote: History of English Poetry, vol. 1, p. 73.]\nseems to me nothing but “stress” verse, like",
        " “Hay-foot, straw-foot, belly full of bean-soup–Hep–Hep!”\nPopular accentual verse persisted, then, while the more cultivated Roman\npublic acquired and then gradually lost, in the course of centuries, its\near for the quantitative rhythms which originally had been copied from the\nGreeks.",
        "Furthermore, according to our ingenious college teachers, there was still\na third principle of versification to be reckoned with, not depending on\nQuantity or Stress, but merely Syllabic, or syllable-counting. This was\nimmemorially old, it seemed, and it had reappeared mysteriously in Europe\nin the Dark Ages.",
        "Dr. Lewis cites from a Latin manuscript poem of the ninth century:\n[Footnote: Foreign Sources, etc., p. 3.]",
        "  “Beatissimus namque Dionysius ¦ Athenis quondam episcopus,\n  Quem Sanctus Clemens direxit in Galliam ¦ propter praedicandi\n    gratiam,” etc.",
        "“Each verse contains 21 syllables, with a caesura after the 12th. No\nfurther regularity, either metrical or rhythmical, can be perceived.\nSuch a verse could probably not have been written except for music.\"\nChurch-music, apparently, was also a factor in the development of\nversification,–particularly that “Gregorian\" style which demanded neither\nquantitative nor accentual rhythm, but simply a fair count of syllables in\nthe libretto, note matching syllable exactly. But when the great medieval\nLatin hymns, like Dies ire, were written, the Syllabic principle of\nversification, like the Quantitative principle, dropped out of sight,\nand we witness once more the emergence of the Stress or accentual system,\nheavily ornamented with rhymes.\n[Footnote: See the quotation from Taylor’s Classical Heritage of the\nMiddle Ages printed in the “Notes and Illustrations” for this chapter.]\nYet the Syllabic method reappears once more, we were told, in French\nprosody, and thus affects the verse of Chaucer and of subsequent English\npoetry, and it still may be studied, isolated as far as may be from\nconsiderations of quantity and stress, in certain English songs written\nfor music, where syllable carefully matches note. The “long metre\"\n(8 syllables), “short metre” (6 syllables) and “common metre\"\n(7 syllables, 6 syllables) of the hymn books is a convenient\nillustration of thinking of metre in terms of syllables alone.",
        "6. The Appeal to the Ear\nAt this point, perhaps, having set forth the three theories of Quantity,\nStress and Syllable, our instructors were sensible enough to make an\nappeal to the ear. Reminding us that stress was the controlling principle\nin Germanic poetry,–although not denying that considerations of quantity\nand number of syllables might have something to do with the effect,–they\nread aloud to us some Old English verse. Perhaps it was that Song of the\nBattle of Brunanburh which Tennyson has so skilfully rendered into modern\nEnglish words while preserving the Old English metre. And here, though the\nAnglo-Saxon words were certainly uncouth, we caught the chief stresses\nwithout difficulty, usually four beats to the line. If the instructor,\nwhile these rude strokes of rhythm were still pounding in our ears,\nfollowed the Old English with a dozen lines of Chaucer, we could all\nperceive the presence of a newer, smoother, more highly elaborated\nverse-music, where the number of syllables had been cunningly\nreckoned, and the verse-accent seemed always to fall upon a syllable long\nand strong enough to bear the weight easily, and the rhymes rippled like a\nbrook. Whether we called the metre of the Prologue rhymed couplets of\niambic pentameter, or rhymed couplets of ten-syllabled, five-stressed\nverse, the music, at least, was clear enough. And so was the music of the\n\"blank” or unrhymed five-stress lines of Marlowe and Shakspere and Milton,\nand as we listened it was easy to believe that “stress” and “quantity” and\n\"syllable,” all playing together like a chime of bells, are concordant and\nnot quarrelsome elements in the harmony of modern English verse. Only, to\nbe richly concordant, each must be prepared to yield a little if need be,\nto the other!",
        "I have taken too many pages, perhaps, in thus sketching the rudimentary\neducation of a college student in the elements of rhythm and metre, and in\nshowing how the theoretical difficulties of the subject–which are\nadmittedly great–often disappear as soon as one resolves to let the ear\ndecide. A satisfied ear may soothe a dissatisfied mind. I have quoted from\na letter of an American scholar about quantity being the “controlling\"\nelement of cultivated Roman verse, and I now quote from a personal letter\nof an American poet, emphasizing the necessity of “reading poetry as it\nwas meant to be read”: “My point is not that English verse has no\nquantity, but that the controlling element is not quantity but accent. The\nlack of fixed syllabic quantity is just what I emphasize. This lack\nmakes definite beat impossible: or at least it makes it absurd to\nattempt to scan English verse by feet. The proportion of ’irregularities’\nand ’exceptions’ becomes painful to the student and embarrassing to the\nprofessor. He is put to fearful straits to explain his prosody and make it\nfit the verse. And when he has done all this, the student, if he has a\ngood ear, forthwith forgets it all, and reads the verse as it was meant to\nbe read, as a succession of musical bars (without pitch, of course), in\nwhich the accent marks the rhythm, and pauses and rests often take the\nplace of missing syllables. To this ingenuous student I hold out my hand\nand cast in my lot with him. He is the man for whom English poetry is\nwritten.”",
        "It may be objected, of course, that the phrase “reading poetry as it was\nmeant to be read” really begs the question. For English poets have often\namused themselves by composing purely quantitative verse, which they wish\nus to read as quantitative. The result may be as artificial as the\npainfully composed Latin quantitative verse of English schoolboys, but the\nthing can be done. Tennyson’s experiments in quantity are well known, and\nshould be carefully studied. He was proud of his hexameter:",
        "  “High winds roaring above me, dark leaves falling about me,”",
        "and of his pentameter:",
        "  “All men alike hate slops, particularly gruel.”",
        "Here the English long and short syllables–as far as “long” and “short\"\ncan be definitely distinguished in English–correspond precisely to the\nrules of Roman prosody. The present Laureate, Robert Bridges, whose\ninvestigations in English and Roman prosody have been incessant, has\nrecently published a book of experiments in writing English quantitative\nhexameters.\n[Footnote: Ibant Obscuri. New York, Oxford University Press, 1917.]\nHere are half a dozen lines:",
        "  “Midway of all this tract, with secular arms an immense elm\n  Reareth a crowd of branches, aneath whose lofty protection\n  Vain dreams thickly nestle, clinging unto the foliage on high:\n  And many strange creatures of monstrous form and features\n  Stable about th’ entrance, Centaur and Scylla’s abortion,\n  And hundred-handed Briareus, and Lerna’s wild beast....”",
        "These are lines interesting to the scholar, but they are somehow\n\"non-English” in their rhythm–not in accordance with “the genius of the\nlanguage,” as we vaguely but very sensibly say. Neither did the stressed\n\"dactylic” hexameters of Longfellow, written though they were by a skilful\nversifier, quite conform to “the nature of the language.”",
        "7. The Analogy with Music\nOne other attempt to explain the difficulties of English rhythm and metre\nmust at least be mentioned here, namely the “musical” theory of the\nAmerican poet and musician, Sidney Lanier. In his Science of English\nVerse, an acute and very suggestive book, he threw over the whole theory\nof stress–or at least, retained it as a mere element of assistance, as in\nmusic, to the marking of time, maintaining that the only necessary element\nin rhythm is equal time-intervals, corresponding to bars of music.\nAccording to Lanier, the structure of English blank verse, for instance,\nis not an alternation of unstressed with stressed syllables, but a series\nof bars of 3/8 time, thus:",
        "[Illustration: Five bars of 3/8 time, each with a short and a long note.]",
        "Thomson, Dabney and other prosodists have followed Lanier’s general\ntheory, without always agreeing with him as to whether blank verse is\nwritten in 3/8 or 2/4 time. Alden, in a competent summary of these various\nmusical theories as to the basis of English verse,\n[Footnote: Introduction to Poetry, pp. 190-93. See also Alden’s English\nVerse, Part 3. “The Time-Element in English Verse.\"]\nquotes with approval Mr. T. S. Omond’s words: “Musical notes are almost\npure symbols. In theory at least, and no doubt substantially in practice,\nthey can be divided with mathematical accuracy–into fractions of 1/2,\n1/4, 1/8, 1/16, etc.–and the ideal of music is absolute accordance with\ntime. Verse has other methods and another ideal. Its words are concrete\nthings, not readily carved to such exact pattern.... The perfection of\nmusic lies in absolute accordance with time, that of verse is continual\nslight departures from time. This is why no musical representations of\nverse ever seem satisfactory. They assume regularity where none exists.”",
        "8. Prosody and Enjoyment\nIt must be expected then, that there will be different preferences in\nchoosing a nomenclature for modern English metres, based upon the\ndifferences in the individual physical organism of various metrists, and\nupon the strictness of their adherence to the significance of stress,\nquantity and number of syllables in the actual forms of verse. Adherents\nof musical theories in the interpretation of verse may prefer to speak of\n\"duple time” instead of iambic-trochaic metres, and of “triple” time for\nanapests and dactyls. Natural “stressers” may prefer to call iambic and\nanapestic units “rising” feet, to indicate the ascent of stress as one\npasses from the weaker to the stronger syllables; and similarly, to call\ntrochaic and dactylic units “falling” feet, to indicate the descent or\ndecline of stress as the weaker syllable or syllables succeed the\nstronger. Or, combining these two modes of nomenclature, one may\nlegitimately speak of iambic feet as “duple rising,”",
        "  “And never lifted up a single stone\";",
        "trochaic as “duple falling,”",
        "  “Here they are, my fifty perfect poems\";",
        "anapestic as “triple rising,”",
        "  “But he lived with a lot of wild mates, and they never would let him be\ngood\";",
        "and dactylic as “triple falling\";",
        "  “Cannon to right of them, cannon to left of them.”",
        "If a line is felt as “metrical,” i.e. divided into approximately equal\ntime-intervals, the particular label employed to indicate the nature of\nthe metre is unimportant. It may be left to the choice of each student of\nmetre, provided he uses his terms consistently. The use of the traditional\nterminology “iambic,” “trochaic,” etc., is convenient, and is open to no\nobjection if one is careful to make clear the sense in which he employs\nsuch ambiguous terms.",
        "It should also be added, as a means of reconciling the apparently warring\nclaims of stress and quantity in English poetry, that recent\ninvestigations in recording through delicate instruments the actual\ntime-intervals used by different persons in reading aloud the same lines\nof poetry, prove what has long been suspected, namely, the close\naffiliation of quantity with stress.\n[Footnote: “Syllabic Quantity in English Verse,” by Ada F. Snell, Pub. Of\nMod, Lang. Ass., September, 1918.]\nMiss Snell’s experiments show that the foot in English verse is made up of\nsyllables 90 per cent of which are, in the stressed position, longer than\nthose in the unstressed. The average relation of short to long syllables,\nis, in spite of a good deal of variation among the individual readers,\nalmost precisely as 2 to 4–which has always been the accepted ratio for\nthe relation of short to long syllables in Greek and Roman verse. If one\nexamines English words in a dictionary, the quantities of the syllables\nare certainly not “fixed” as they are in Greek and Latin, but the moment\none begins to read a passage of English poetry aloud, and becomes\nconscious of its underlying type of rhythm, he fits elastic units of\n\"feet” into the steadily flowing or pulsing intervals of time.\nThe “foot” becomes, as it were, a rubber link in a moving bicycle chain.\nThe revolutions of the chain mark the rhythm; and the stressed or\nunstressed or lightly stressed syllables in each “link” or foot,\naccommodate themselves, by almost unperceived expansion and contraction,\nto the rhythmic beat of the passage as a whole.",
        "Nor should it be forgotten that the “sense” of words, their\nmeaning-weight, their rhetorical value in certain phrases, constantly\naffects the theoretical number of stresses belonging to a given line. In\nblank verse, for instance, the theoretical five chief stresses are often\nbut three or four in actual practice, lighter stresses taking their place\nin order to avoid a pounding monotony, and conversely, as in Milton’s\nfamous line,",
        "  “Rocks, caves, lakes, dens, bogs, fens, and shades of death,”",
        "the rhetorical significance of the monosyllables compels an overloading of\nstresses which heightens the desired poetic effect. Corson’s Primer of\nEnglish Verse and Mayor’s English Metres give numerous examples from\nthe blank verse of Milton and Tennyson to illustrate the constant\nsubstitution and shifting of stresses in order to secure variety of music\nand suggestive adaptations of sound to sense. It is well known that\nShakspere’s blank verse, as he developed in command of his artistic\nresources, shows fewer “end-stopped” lines and more “run-on” lines, with\nan increasing proportion of light and weak endings. But the same principle\napplies to every type of English rhythm. As soon as the dominant\nbeat–which is commonly, but not always, apparent in the opening measures\nof the poem–once asserts itself, the poet’s mastery of technique is\nrevealed through his skill in satisfying the ear with a verbal music which\nis never absolutely identical in its time-intervals, its stresses or its\npitch, with the fixed, wooden pattern of the rhythm he is using.",
        "For the human voice utters syllables which vary their duration, stress and\npitch with each reader. Photographs of voice-waves, as printed by Verrier,\nScripture, and many other laboratory workers, show how great is the\ndifference between individuals in the intervals covered by the upward and\ndownward slides or “inflections” which indicate doubt or affirmation. And\nthese “rising” and “falling” and “circumflex” and “suspended” inflections,\nwhich make up what is called “pitch-accent,” are constantly varied, like\nthe duration and stress of syllables, by the emotions evoked in reading.\nWords, phrases, lines and stanzas become colored with emotional overtones\ndue to the feeling of the instant. Poetry read aloud as something sensuous\nand passionate cannot possibly conform exactly to a set mechanical pattern\nof rhythm and metre. Yet the hand-woven Oriental rug, though lacking the\ngeometrical accuracy of a rug made by machinery, reveals a more vital and\nintimate beauty of design and execution. Many well-known poets–Tennyson\nbeing perhaps the most familiar example–have read aloud their own verses\nwith a peculiar chanting sing-song which seemed to over-emphasize the\nfundamental rhythm. But who shall correct them? And who is entitled to say\nthat a line like Swinburne’s",
        "  “Full-sailed, wide-winged, poised softly forever asway”",
        "is irregular according to the foot-rule of traditional prosody, when it is\nprobable, as Mr. C. E. Russell maintains, that Swinburne was here\ncomposing in purely musical and not prosodical rhythm?\n[Footnote: “Swinburne and Music,” by Charles E. Russell, North American\nReview, November, 1907. See the quotation in the “Notes and\nIllustrations” for this chapter.]",
        "Is it not true, furthermore, as some metrical sceptics like to remind us,\nthat if we once admit the principle of substitution and equivalence, of\nhypermetrical and truncated syllables, of pauses taking the place of\nsyllables, we can very often make one metre seem very much like another?\nThe question of calling a given group of lines “iambic” or “trochaic,” for\ninstance, can be made quite arbitrary, depending upon where you begin to\ncount syllables. “Iambic” with initial truncation or “trochaic” with final\ntruncation? Tweedle-dum or tweedle-dee? Do you count waves from crest to\ncrest or from hollow to hollow? When you count the links in a bicycle\nchain, do you begin with the slender middle of each link or with one of\nthe swelling ends? So is it with this “iambic” and “trochaic” matter.\nProfessor Alden, in a suggestive pamphlet,\n[Footnote: “The Mental Side of Metrical Form,” already cited.]\nconfesses that these contrasting concepts of rising and falling metre are\nnothing more than concepts, alterable at will.",
        "But while the experts in prosody continue to differ and to dogmatize, the\nlover of poetry should remember that versification is far older than the\nscience of prosody, and that the enjoyment of verse is, for millions of\nhuman beings, as unaffected by theories of metrics as the stars are\nunaffected by the theories of astronomers. It is a satisfaction to the\nmind to know that the stars in their courses are amenable to law, even\nthough one be so poor a mathematician as to be incapable of grasping and\nstating the law. The mathematics of music and of poetry, while heightening\nthe intellectual pleasure of those capable of comprehending it, is\nadmittedly too difficult for the mass of men. But no lover of poetry\nshould refuse to go as far in theorizing as his ear will carry him. He\nwill find that his susceptibility to the pulsations of various types of\nrhythm, and his delight in the intricacies of metrical device, will be\nheightened by the mental effort of attention and analysis. The danger is\nthat the lover of poetry, wearied by the quarrels of prosodists, and\nforgetting the necessity of patience, compromise and freedom from\ndogmatism, will lose his curiosity about the infinite variety of metrical\neffects. But it is this very curiosity which makes his ear finer, even if\nhis theories may be wrong. Hundreds of metricists admire and envy\nProfessor Saintsbury’s ear for prose and verse rhythms while\ndisagreeing wholly with his dogmatic theories of the “foot,” and his\nsystem of notation. There are sure to be some days and hours when the\nreader of poetry will find himself bored and tired with the effort of\nattention to the technique of verse. Then he can stop analysing, close his\neyes, and drift out to sea upon the uncomprehended music.",
        "  “The stars of midnight shall be dear\n   To her; and she shall lean her ear\n   In many a secret place\n   Where rivulets dance their wayward round,\n   And beauty born of murmuring sound\n   Shall pass into her face.”",

        "1. Battles Long Ago\nAs we pass from the general consideration of Rhythm and Metre to some of\nthe special questions involved in Rhyme, Stanza and Free Verse, it may be\nwell to revert to the old distinction between what we called for\nconvenience the “outside” and the “inside” of a work of art. In the field\nof music we saw that this distinction is almost, if not quite,\nmeaningless, and in poetry it ought not to be pushed too far. Yet it is\nuseful in explaining the differences among men as they regard, now the\nexternal form of verse, and now its inner spirit, and as they ask\nthemselves how these two elements are related. Professor Butcher, in his\nAristotle’s Theory of Poetry and Fine Art,\n[Footnote: Page 147.]\ndescribes the natural tendencies of two sorts of men, who are quite as\npersistent to-day as ever they were in Greece in looking at one side only\nof the question:",
        "  “We need not agree with a certain modern school who would empty all\n  poetry of poetical thought and etherealize it till it melts into a\n  strain of music; who sing to us we hardly know of what, but in such a\n  way that the echoes of the real world, its men and women, its actual\n  stir and conflict, are faint and hardly to be discerned. The poetry,\n  we are told, resides not in the ideas conveyed, not in the blending\n  of soul and sense, but in the sound itself, in the cadence of the\n  verse. Yet, false as this view may be, it is not perhaps more false\n  than that other which wholly ignores the effect of musical sound and\n  looks only to the thought that is conveyed. Aristotle comes\n  perilously near this doctrine.”",
        "But it is not Aristotle only who permits himself at times to undervalue\nthe formal element in verse. It is also Sir Philip Sidney, with his famous\n\"verse being but an ornament and no cause to poetry” and “it is not riming\nand versing that maketh a poet.” It is Shelley with his “The distinction\nbetween poets and prose writers in a vulgar error.... Plato was\nessentially a poet–the truth and splendor of his imagery, and the melody\nof his language, are the most intense that it is possible to conceive....\nLord Bacon was a poet.” It is Coleridge with his “The writings of Plato,\nand Bishop Taylor, and the Theoria Sacra of Burnet, furnish undeniable\nproofs that poetry of the highest kind may be written without metre.”",
        "In such passages as these, how generous are Sidney, Shelley, and Coleridge\nto the prose-men! And yet these same poet-critics, in dozens of other\npassages, have explained the fundamental justification of metre, rhyme and\nstanza as elements in the harmony of verse. Harmony may be attained, it is\ntrue, by rhythms too complicated to be easily scanned in metrical feet,\nand by measures which disregard rhyme and stanza; and poets, as well as\ncritics, by giving exclusive attention to a single element in harmony, are\nable to persuade themselves for the moment that all other elements are\nrelatively negligible. Milton, in his zeal for blank verse, attacked\nrhyme, in which he had already proved himself a master, quite as fiercely\nas any of our contemporary champions of free verse. Campion, a trained\nmusician, argued for a quantitative system of English prosody during the\nvery period when he was composing, in the accentual system, some of the\nmost exquisite songs in the language. Daniel, whose Defense of Rhyme(1603) was a triumphant reply to Campion’s theory, gave courteous\npraise to his opponent’s practice. Dryden, most flexible-minded of\ncritics, argues now for, and now against the use of rhymed heroic couplets\nin the drama, fitting his theories to the changing currents of\ncontemporary taste as well as to the varying, self-determined technique of\nhis own plays. “Never wholly out of the way, nor in it,” was Dryden’s\nhappy phrase to describe the artist’s freedom, a freedom always conscious\nof underlying law.",
        "2. Rhyme as a Form of Rhythm\nHowever theory and practice may happen to coincide or to drift apart, the\nfundamental law which justifies rhyme and stanza seems to be this: if\nrhythm is a primary fact in poetry, and metre is, as Aristotle called it,\nsections of rhythm, any device of repeating identical or nearly identical\nsounds at measured intervals is an aid to rhythmical effect. Rhyme is thus\na form, an “externalizing” of rhythm. It is structural as well as\ndecorative, or rather, it is one way of securing structure, of building\nverse. There are other devices, of course, for attaining symmetrical\npatterns, for conveying an impression of unity in variety. The “parallel\"\nstructure of Hebrew poetry, where one idea and phrase is balanced against\nanother,",
        "  “I have slain a man to my wounding–\n   And a young man to my hurt–”",
        "or the “envelope” structure of many of the Psalms, where the initial\nphrase or idea is repeated at the close, after the insertion of\nillustrative matter, thus securing a pattern by the “return” of the main\nidea–the closing of the “curve\"–may serve to illustrate the universality\nof the principle of balance and contrast and repetition in the\narchitecture of verse. For Hebrew poetry, like the poetry of many\nprimitive peoples, utilized the natural pleasure which the ear takes in\nlistening for and perceiving again an already uttered sound. Rhyme\nis a gratification of expectation, like the repetition of a chord in music\n[Footnote: “Most musical compositions are written in quite obvious rhymes;\nand the array of familiar and classical works that have not only rhymes\nbut distinct stanzaic arrangements exactly like those of poetry is worth\nremembering. Mendelssohn’s ’Spring Song’ and Rubinstein’s ’Romance in E\nFlat’ will occur at once as examples in which the stanzas are\nunmistakable.” C. E. Russell, “Swinburne and Music,” North American\nReview, November, 1907.]\nor of colors in a rug. It assists the mind in grasping the sense-rhythm,–\nthe design of the piece as a whole.

        "The pulses cannot help quickening as the rhymes quicken.",
        "But in order to perform this structural, rhythmical purpose it is not\nnecessary that rhyme be of any single recognized type. As long as the\near receives the pleasure afforded by accordant sound, any of the various\nhistorical forms of rhyme may serve. It may be Alliteration, the\nletter-rhyme or “beginning-rhyme” of Old English poetry:",

        "  “Mighty the Mercian,\n  Hard was his hand-play,\n  Sparing not any of\n  Those that with Anlaf,\n  Warriors over the\n  Weltering waters\n  Borne in the bark’s-bosom,\n  Drew to this island–\n  Doomed to the death.”",
        "This repetition of initial letters survives in phrases of prose like\n\"dead and done with,” “to have and to hold,” and it is utilized in modern\nverse to give further emphasis to accentual syllables. But masters of\nalliterative effects, like Keats, Tennyson and Verlaine, constantly employ\nalliteration in unaccented syllables so as to color the tone-quality of a\nline without a too obvious assault upon the ear. The unrhymed songs of\nThe Princess are full of these delicate modulations of sound.",
        "In Common rhyme, or “end-rhyme” (found–abound), the accented vowel and\nall succeeding sounds are repeated, while the consonants preceding the\naccented vowel vary. Assonance, in its stricter sense, means the\nrepetition of an accented vowel (blackness–dances), while the succeeding\nsounds vary, but the terms “assonance” and “consonance” are often employed\nloosely to signify harmonious effects of tone-color within a line or group\nof lines. Complete or “identical” rhymes (fair–affair), which were\nlegitimate in Chaucer’s time, are not now considered admissible in\nEnglish. “Masculine” rhymes are end-rhymes of one syllable; “feminine\"\nrhymes are end-rhymes of two syllables (uncertain–curtain); internal or\n\"middle-rhymes” are produced by the repetition at the end of a line of a\nrhyme-sound already employed within the line.",
        "  “We were the first that ever burst  Into that silent sea.”",
        "In general, the more frequent the repetitions of rhyme, the quicker is the\nrhythmic movement of the poem, and conversely. Thus, the In Memoriamstanza attains its peculiar effect of retardation by rhyming the first\nline with the fourth, so that the ear is compelled to wait for the\nexpected recurrence of the first rhyme sound.",
        "  “Beside the river’s wooded reach,\n  The fortress and the mountain ridge,\n  The cataract flashing from the bridge,\n  The breaker breaking on the beach.”",
        "This gives a movement markedly different from that secured by rearranging\nthe same lines in alternate rhymes:",
        "  “Beside the river’s wooded reach,\n  The fortress and the mountain ridge,\n  The breaker breaking on the beach,\n  The cataract flashing from the bridge.”",
        "If all the various forms of rhyme are only different ways of emphasizing\nrhythm through the repetition of accordant sounds, it follows that the\nvarying rhythmical impulses of poets and of readers will demand now a\ngreater and now a less dependence upon this particular mode of rhythmical\nsatisfaction. Chaucer complained of the scarcity of rhymes in English as\ncompared with their affluence in Old French, and it is true that rhyming\nis harder in our tongue than in the Romance languages. We have had\nmagicians of rhyme, like Swinburne, whose very profusion of rhyme-sounds\nends by cloying the taste of many a reader, and sending him back to blank\nverse or on to free verse. The Spenserian stanza, which calls for one\nfourfold set of rhymes, one threefold, and one double, all cunningly\ninterlaced, is as complicated a piece of rhyme-harmony as the ear of\nthe average lover of poetry can carry. It is needless to say that there\nare born rhymers, who think in rhyme and whose fecundity of imagery is\nmultiplied by the excitement of matching sound with sound. They are often\ncareless in their prodigality, inexact in their swift catching at any\nrhyme-word that will serve. At the other extreme are the self-conscious\nartists in verse who abhor imperfect concordances, and polish their rhymes\nuntil the life and freshness disappear. For sheer improvising cleverness\nof rhyme Byron is still unmatched, but he often contents himself with\napproximate rhymes that are nearly as bad as some of Mrs. Browning’s and\nWhittier’s. Very different is the deliberate artifice of the following\nlines, where the monotony of the rhyme-sound fits the “solemn ennui\"\nof the trailing peacocks;",
        "                              I\n  “From out the temple’s pillared portico,\n  Thence to the gardens where blue poppies blow\n  The gold and emerald peacocks saunter slow,\n  Trailing their solemn ennui as they go,\n  Trailing their melancholy and their woe.",
        "                              II\n  “Trailing their melancholy and their woe,\n  Trailing their solemn ennui as they go\n  The gold and emerald peacocks saunter slow\n  From out the gardens where blue poppies blow\n  Thence to the temple’s pillared portico.\"\n[Footnote: Frederic Adrian Lopere, “World Wisdom,” The International,\nSeptember, 1915.]",
        "Rhyme, then, is not merely a “jingle,” it is rather, as Samuel Johnson\nsaid of all versification, a “joining music with reason.” Its blending of\ndecorative with structural purpose is in truth “a dictate of nature,” or,\nto quote E. C. Stedman, “In real, that is, spontaneous minstrelsy, the\nfittest assonance, consonance, time, even rime,... come of themselves\nwith imaginative thought.”",
        "3. Stanza\nThere are some lovers of poetry, however, who will grant this theoretical\njustification of rhyme as an element in the harmony of verse, without\nadmitting that the actual rhyming stanzas of English verse show\n\"spontaneous minstrelsy.” The word “stanza” or “strophe” means literally\n\"a resting-place,” a halt or turn, that is to say, after a uniform group\nof rhymed lines. Alden defines it in his English Verse as “the largest\nunit of verse-measure ordinarily recognized. It is based not so much on\nrhythmical divisions as on periods either rhetorical or melodic; that is,\na short stanza will roughly correspond to the period of a sentence, and a\nlong one to that of a paragraph, while in lyrical verse the original idea\nwas to conform the stanza to the melody for which it was written.\"\n\"Normally, then,” Alden adds in his Introduction to Poetry, “all the\nstanzas of a poem are identical in the number, the length, the metre, and\nthe rime-scheme of the corresponding verses.” The question arises,\ntherefore, whether those units which we call “stanzas” are arbitrary or\nvital. Have the lines been fused into their rhymed grouping by passionate\nfeeling, or is their unity a mere mechanical conformation to a pattern? In\nTheodore Watts-Dunton’s well-known article on “Poetry” in the\nEncyclopaedia Brittanica[Footnote: Now reprinted, with many expansions, in his Poetry and the\nRenascence of Wonder. E. P. Dutton, New York.]\nthe phrases “stanzaic law” and “emotional law” are used to represent the\ntwo principles at issue:",
        "  “In modern prosody the arrangement of the rhymes and the length of\n  the lines in any rhymed metrical passage may be determined either by\n  a fixed stanzaic law, or by a law infinitely deeper–by the law which\n  impels the soul, in a state of poetic exultation, to seize hold of\n  every kind of metrical aid, such as rhyme, caesura, etc., for the\n  purpose of accentuating and marking off each shade of emotion as it\n  arises, regardless of any demands of stanza.... If a metrical passage\n  does not gain immensely by being written independently of stanzaic\n  law, it loses immensely; and for this reason, perhaps, that the great\n  charm of the music of all verse, as distinguished from the music of\n  prose, is inevitableness of cadence. In regular metres we enjoy the\n  pleasure of feeling that the rhymes will inevitably fall under a\n  recognized law of couplet or stanza. But if the passage flows\n  independently of these, it must still flow inevitably–it must, in\n  short, show that it is governed by another and a yet deeper force,\n  the inevitableness of emotional expression.”",
        "This distinction between “stanzaic law” and “emotional law” is highly\nsuggestive and not merely in its application to the metres of the famous\nregular and irregular odes of English verse. It applies also to the\ninfinite variety of stanza-patterns which English poetry has taken over\nfrom Latin and French sources and developed through centuries\nofexperimentation, and it affords a key, as we shall see in a moment, to\nsome of the vexed questions involved in free verse.",
        "Take first the more familiar of the stanza forms of English verse. They\nare conveniently indicated by using letters of the alphabet to correspond\nwith each rhyme-sound, whenever repeated.",
        "Thus the rhymed couplet",
        "  “Around their prows the ocean roars,\n  And chafes beneath their thousand oars”",
        "may be marked as “four-stress iambic,” rhyming aa; the heroic couplet",
        "  “The zeal of fools offends at any time,\n  But most of all the zeal of fools in rhyme”",
        "as five-stress iambic, rhyming aa. The familiar measure of English\nballad poetry,",

        "  “’Loke up, I seye, and telle me what she is\n  Anon, that I may gone aboute thi nede:\n  Know iche hire ought? for my love telle me this;\n  Thanne wolde I hopen the rather for to spede.’\n  Tho gan the veyne of Troilus to blede,\n  For he was hit, and wex alle rede for schame;\n  ’Aha!’ quod Pandare, ’here bygynneth game.’”",
        "Byron’s “ottava rima” rhymes a b a b a b c c:",
        "  “A mighty mass of brick, and smoke, and shipping,\n    Dirty and dusky, but as wide as eye\n  Could reach, with here and there a sail just skipping\n    In sight, then lost amidst the forestry\n  Of masts; a wilderness of steeples peeping\n    On tiptoe through their sea-coal canopy;\n  A huge, dun cupola, like a foolscap crown\n  On a fool’s head–and there is London Town!”",
        "The Spenserian stanza rhymes a b a b b c b c c, with an extra foot in\nthe final line:",
        "  “Hee had a faire companion of his way,\n  A goodly lady clad in scarlot red,\n  Purfled with gold and pearle of rich assay;\n  And like a Persian mitre on her hed\n  Shee wore, with crowns and owches garnished,\n  The which her lavish lovers to her gave:\n  Her wanton palfrey all was overspred\n  With tinsell trappings, woven like a wave,\n  Whose bridle rung with golden bels and bosses brave.”",
        "In considering these various groups of lines which we call stanzas it is\nclear that we have to do with thought-units as well as feeling-units, and\nthat both thought-units and feeling-units should be harmonized, if\npossible, with the demands of beauty and variety of sound as represented\nby the rhymes. It is not absurd to speak of the natural “size” of poetic\nthoughts. Pope, for instance, often works with ideas of couplet size, just\nas Martial sometimes amused himself with ideas of a still smaller epigram\nsize, or Omar Khayyam with thoughts and fancies that came in quatrain\nsizes. Many sonnets fail of effectiveness because the contained thought is\ntoo scanty or too full to receive adequate expression in the fourteen\nlines demanded by the traditional sonnet form. They are sometimes only\nquatrain ideas, blown up big with words to fill out the fourteen\nlines, or, on the contrary, as often with the Elizabethans, they are whole\nodes or elegies, remorselessly packed into the fashionable fourteen-line\nlimit. No one who has given attention to the normal length of phrases and\nsentences doubts that there are natural “breathfuls” of words\ncorresponding to the units of ideas; and when ideas are organized by\nemotion, there are waves, gusts, or ripples of words, matching the waves\nof feeling. In the ideal poetic “pattern,” these waves of idea, feeling\nand rhythmic speech would coincide more or less completely; we should have\na union of “emotional law” with “stanzaic law,” the soul of poetry would\nfind its perfect embodiment.",
        "But if we turn the pages of any collection of English poetry, say the\nGolden Treasury or the Oxford Book of English Verse, we find something\nvery different from this ideal embodiment of each poetic emotion in a form\ndelicately moulded to the particular species of emotion revealed. We\ndiscover that precisely similar stanzaic patterns–like similar metrical\npatterns–are often used to express diametrically opposite feelings,–let\nus say, joy and sorrow, doubt and exultation, victory and defeat. The\n\"common metre” of English hymnology is thus seen to be a rough mould into\nwhich almost any kind of religious emotion may be poured. If “trochaic\"\nmeasures do not always trip it on a light fantastic toe, neither do\n\"iambic” measures always pace sedately. Doubtless there is a certain\ngeneral fitness, in various stanza forms, for this or that poetic purpose:\nthe stanzas employed by English or Scotch balladry are admittedly\nexcellent for story-telling; Spenser’s favorite stanza is unrivalled\nfor painting dream-pictures and rendering dream-music, but less available\nfor pure narration; Chaucer’s seven-line stanza, so delicately balanced\nupon that fourth, pivotal line, can paint a picture and tell a story too;\nByron’s ottava rima has a devil-may-care jauntiness, borrowed, it is\ntrue, from his Italian models, but perfectly fitted to Byron’s own mood;\nthe rhymed couplets of Pope sting and glitter like his antitheses, and the\ncouplets of Dryden have their “resonance like a great bronze coin thrown\ndown on marble\"; each great artist in English verse, in short, chooses by\ninstinct the general stanza form best suited to his particular purpose,\nand then moulds its details with whatever cunning he may possess. But the\nsignificant point is this: “stanzaic law” makes for uniformity, for the\nendless repetition of the chosen pattern, which must still be recognized\nas a pattern, however subtly the artist modulates his details; and in\nadjusting the infinitely varied material of thought and feeling, phrase\nand image, picture and story to the fixed stanzaic design, there are bound\nto be gaps and patches, stretchings and foldings of the thought-stuff,–\nfor even as in humble tailor-craft, this many-colored coat of poetry must\nbe cut according to the cloth as well as according to the pattern. How\nmany pages of even the Oxford Book of English Verse are free from some\ntouch of feebleness, of redundancy, of constraint due to the remorseless\nrequirements of the stanza? The line must be filled out, whether or not\nthe thought is quite full enough for it; rhyme must match rhyme, even if\nthe thought becomes as far-fetched as the rhyming word; the stanza, in\nshort, demands one kind of perfection as a constantly repeated musical\ndesign, as beauty of form; and another kind of perfection as the\nexpression of human emotion. Sometimes these two perfections of “form” and\n\"significance” are miraculously wedded, stanza after stanza, and we have\nour “Ode to a Nightingale,” or “Ode to Autumn” as the result. (And perhaps\nthe best, even in this kind, are but shadows, when compared with the\nabsolute union of truth and beauty as the poetic idea first took rhythmic\nform in the brain of the poet.)",
        "Yet more often lovers of poetry must content themselves, not with such\n\"dictates of nature” as these poems, but with approximations. Each\nstanzaic form has its conveniences, its “fatal facility,” its natural\nfitness for singing a song or telling a story or turning a thought over\nand over into music. Intellectual readers will always like the\nepigrammatic “snap” of the couplet, and Spenser will remain, largely\nbecause of his choice of stanza, the “poet’s poet.” Perhaps\nthe very necessity of fitting rhymes together stimulates as much poetic\nactivity as it discourages; for many poets have testified that the delight\nof rhyming adds energy to the imagination. If, as Shelley said, “the mind\nin creation is as a fading coal, which some invisible influence, like an\ninconstant wind, awakens to transitory brightness,” why may it not be the\nbreath of rhyme, as well as any other form of rhythmic energy, which\nquickens its drooping flame? And few poets, furthermore, will admit that\nthey are really in bondage to their stanzas. They love to dance in these\nfetters, and even when wearing the same fetters as another poet, they\nnevertheless invent movements of their own, so that Mr. Masefield’s\n\"Chaucerian” stanzas are really not so much Chaucer’s as Masefield’s.",
        "Each Ulysses makes and bends his own bow, after all; it is only the\nunsuccessful suitors for the honors of poetic craftsmanship who complain\nof its difficulties. Something of our contemporary impatience with fixed\nstanzaic forms is due perhaps to the failure to recognize that the greater\npoets succeed in making over every kind of poetic pattern in the act of\nemploying it, just as a Chopin minuet differs from a Liszt minuet,\nalthough both composers are using the same fundamental form of dance\nmusic. We must allow for the infinite variety of creative intention,\ntechnique and result. The true defence of rhyme and stanza against the\narguments of extreme advocates of free verse is to point out that\nrhyme and stanza are natural structural devices for securing certain\neffects. There are various types of bridges for crossing different kinds\nof streams; no one type of bridge is always and everywhere the best. To do\naway with rhyme and stanza is to renounce some modes of poetic beauty; it\nis to resolve that there shall be one less way of crossing the stream. An\nadvocate of freedom in the arts may well admit that the artist may bridge\nhis particular stream in any way he can,–or he may ford it or swim it or\ngo over in an airplane if he chooses. But some method must be found of\ngetting his ideas and emotions “across” into the mind and feelings of the\nreaders of his poetry. If this can adequately be accomplished without\nrecourse to rhyme and stanza, very well; there is Paradise Lost, for\ninstance, and Hamlet. But here we are driven back again upon the\ncountless varieties of artistic intention and craftsmanship and effect.\nEach method–and there are as many methods as there are poets and far\nmore, for craftsmen like Milton and Tennyson try hundreds of methods in\ntheir time–is only a medium through which the artist is endeavoring to\nattain a special result. It is one way–only one, and perhaps not the best\nway–of trying to cross the stream.",
        "4. Free Verse\nRecalling now the discussion of the rhythms of prose in the previous\nchapter, and remembering that rhyme and stanza are special forms of\nreinforcing the impulse of rhythm, what shall be said of free verse? It\nbelongs, unquestionably, in that “neutral zone” which some readers, in Dr.\nPatterson’s phrase, instinctively appropriate as “prose experience,” and\nothers as “verse experience.” It renounces metre–or rather endeavors to\nrenounce it, for it does not always succeed. It professes to do away with\nrhyme and stanza, although it may play cunningly upon the sounds of like\nand unlike words, and it may arrange phrases into poetic paragraphs,\nwhich, aided by the art of typography, secure a kind of stanzaic effect.\nIt cannot, however, do away with the element of rhythm, with ordered time.\nThe moment free verse ceases to be felt as rhythmical, it ceases to be\nfelt as poetry. This is admitted by its advocates and its opponents\nalike. The real question at issue then, is the manner in which free verse\nmay secure the effects of rhythmic unity and variety, without, on the one\nhand, resorting to the obvious rhythms of prose, or on the other hand,\nwithout repeating the recognized patterns of verse. There are many\ncompetent critics who maintain with Edith Wyatt that “on an earth where\nthere is nothing to wear but clothes, nothing to eat but food, there is\nalso nothing to read but prose and poetry.” “According to the results of\nour experiments,” testifies Dr. Patterson, “there is no psychological\nmeaning to claims for a third genre between regular verse and prose,\nexcept in the sense of a jumping back and forth from one side of the fence\nto the other.\"\n[Footnote: The Rhythm of Prose, p. 77.]\nAnd in the preface to his second edition, after having listened to Miss\nAmy Lowell’s readings of free verse, Dr. Patterson remarks: “What is\nachieved, as a rule, in Miss Lowell’s case, is emotional prose,\nemphatically phrased, excellent and moving. Spaced prose, we may call\nit.”",
        "Now “spaced prose” is a useful expression, inasmuch as it calls attention\nto the careful emphasis and balance of phrases which up so much of the\nrhetorical structure of free verse, and it also serves to remind us of the\npart which typography plays in “spacing” these phrases, and stressing for\nthe eye their curves and “returns.” But we are all agreed that\ntypographical appeals to the eye are infinitely deceptive in blurring the\ndistinction between verse and prose, and that the trained ear must be the\nonly arbiter as to poetical and pseudo-poetical effects. Ask a lover of\nWalt Whitman whether “spaced prose” is the right label for “Out of the\nCradle Endlessly Rocking,” and he will scoff at you. He will maintain that\nfollowing the example of the rich broken rhythms of the English Bible, the\nexample of Ossian, Blake, and many another European experimenter during\nthe Romantic epoch, Whitman really succeeded in elaborating a mode of\npoetical expression, nearer for the most part to recitative than to\naria, yet neither pure declamation nor pure song: a unique embodiment of\npassionate feeling, a veritable “neutral zone,” which refuses to let\nitself be annexed to either “prose” or “verse” as those terms are\nordinarily understood, but for which “free verse” is precisely the right\nexpression. Leaves of Grass (1855) remains the most interesting of all\nexperiments with free verse, written as it was by an artist whose natural\nrhythmical endowment was extraordinary, and whose technical curiosity and\npatience in modulating his tonal effects was unwearied by failures and\nundiscouraged by popular neglect. But the case for free verse does not,\nafter all, stand or fall with Walt Whitman. His was merely the most\npowerful poetic personality among the countless artificers who have\nendeavored to produce rhythmic and tonal beauty through new structural\ndevices.",
        "Readers who are familiar with the experiments of contemporary poets will\neasily recognize four prevalent types of “free verse”:",
        "(a) Sometimes what is printed as “free verse” is nothing but prose\ndisguised by the art of typography, i.e. judged by the ear, it is made up\nwholly of the rhythms of prose.",
        "(b) Sometimes the prose rhythms predominate, without excluding a mixture\nof the recognized rhythms of verse.",
        "(c) Sometimes verse rhythms predominate, and even fixed metrical feet are\nallowed to appear here and there.",
        "(d) Sometimes verse rhythms and metres are used exclusively, although in\nnew combinations which disguise or break up the metrical pattern.",

        "do we catch the rhythm (and even the metre) of verse, and F. P. A. is\nhere imitating Mr. Masters’s way of introducing a strongly rhythmical and\neven metrical line into a passage otherwise flatly “prosaic” in its\ntime-intervals. But “free verse” adopts many other cadences of English\nprose besides this “formless” structure which goes with matter-of-fact\nstatement. It also reproduces the neat, polished, perhaps epigrammatic\nsentence which crystallizes a fact or a generalization; the more emotional\nand “moving” period resulting from heightened feeling, and finally the\nfrankly imitative and ornamented cadences of descriptive and highly\nimpassioned prose.

        "5. Discovery and Rediscovery\nIt is not pretended that the four types of free verse which have been\nillustrated are marked by clear-cut generic differences. They shade into\none another. But they are all based upon a common sensitiveness to the\neffects of rhythmic prose, a common restlessness under what is felt to be\nthe restraint of metre and rhyme, and a common endeavor to break down the\nconventional barrier which separates the characteristic beauty of prose\nspeech from the characteristic beauty of verse. In this endeavor to\nobliterate boundary lines, to secure in one art the effects hitherto\nsupposed to be the peculiar property of another, free verse is only one\nmore evidence of the widespread “confusion of the genres” which marks\ncontemporary artistic effort. It is possible, with the classicists, to\ncondemn outright this blurring of values.\n[Footnote: See, for instance, Irving Babbitt, The New Laokoon. Houghton\nMifflin Company, 1910.]\nOne may legitimately maintain, with Edith Wyatt, that the traditional\nmethods of English verse are to the true artist not oppressions but\nliberations. She calls it “a fallacious idea that all individual and all\nrealistic expression in poetry is annulled by the presence of distinctive\nmusical discernment, by the movement of rhyme with its keen heightening of\nthe impulse of rhythm, by the word-shadows of assonance, by harmonies,\novertones and the still beat of ordered time, subconsciously perceived but\nprecise as the sense of the symphony leader’s flying baton. To readers, to\nwriters for whom the tonal quality of every language is an intrinsic value\nthese faculties of poetry serve not at all as cramping oppressions, but as\ngreat liberations for the communication of truth.\"\n[Footnote: New Republic, August 24, 1918.]\nBut many practitioners of free verse would reply that this is not a matter\nfor theorizing, but of individual preference, and that in their endeavor\nto communicate new modes of feeling, new aspects of beauty, they have a\nright to the use of new forms, even if those new forms be compounded out\nof the wreck of old ones. This argument for freedom of experiment is\nunanswerable; the true test of its validity lies in the results secured.\nThat free verse has now and then succeeded in creating lovely flowering\nhybrids seems to me as indubitable as the magical tricks which Mr. Burbank\nhas played with flowers and fruits. But the smiling Dame Nature sets her\ninexorable limits to “Burbanking\"; she allows it to go about so far, and\nno farther. Freakish free verse, like freakish plants and animals, gets\npunished by sterility. Some of the “imagist” verse patterns are uniquely\nand intricately beautiful. Wrought in a medium which is neither wholly\nverse nor wholly prose, but which borrows some of the beauty peculiar to\neach art, they are their own excuse for being. And nevertheless they may\nnot prove fertile. It may be that they have been produced by “pushing a\nmedium farther than it will go.”",
        "It must be admitted, furthermore, that a great deal of contemporary free\nverse has been written by persons with an obviously incomplete command\nover the resources of expression. Max Eastman has called it “Lazy Verse,\"\nthe product of “aboriginal indolence\"; and he adds this significant\ndistinction, “In all arts it is the tendency of those who are ungrown to\nconfuse the expression of intense feeling with the intense expression of\nfeeling–which last is all the world will long listen to.” Shakspere,\nMilton, Keats are masters of concentrated, intensest expression: their\nverse, at its best, is structural as an oak. Those of us who have read\nwith keen momentary enjoyment thousands of pages of the “New Verse,\"\nare frequently surprised to find how little of it stamps itself upon the\nmemory. Intense feeling has gone into these formless forms, very\ncertainly, but the medium soaks up the feeling like blotting-paper. In\norder to live, poetry must be plastic, a stark embodiment of emotion, and\nnot a solution of emotion.",
        "That fragile, transient fashions of expression have their own evanescent\ntype of beauty no one who knows the history of Euphuism will deny. And\nmuch of the New Verse is Euphuistic, not merely in its self-conscious\ncleverness, its delightful toying with words and phrases for their own\nsake, its search of novel cadences and curves, but also in its naive\npleasure in rediscovering and parodying what the ancients had discovered\nlong before. “Polyphonic prose,” for instance, as announced and\nillustrated by Mr. Paul Fort and Miss Amy Lowell, is prose that\nmakes use of all the “voices” of poetry,–viz. metre, vers libre,\nassonances, alliteration, rhyme and return. “Metrical verse,” says Miss\nLowell in the Preface to Can Grande’s Castle, “has one set of laws,\ncadenced verse another; ’polyphonic prose’ can go from one to the other in\nthe same poem with no sense of incongruity.... I finally decided to base\nmy form upon the long, flowing cadence of oratorical prose. The variations\npermitted to this cadence enable the poet to change the more readily into\nthose of vers libre, or even to take the regular beat of metre, should\nsuch a marked time seem advisable.... Rhyme is employed to give a richness\nof effect, to heighten the musical feeling of a passage, but ... the\nrhymes should seldom come at the ends of the cadences.... Return in\n’polyphonic prose’ is usually achieved by the recurrence of a dominant\nthought or image, coming in irregularly and in varying words, but still\ngiving the spherical effect which I have frequently spoken of as\nimperative in all poetry.”",
        "Now every one of these devices is at least as old as Isocrates. It was in\nthis very fashion that Euphues and his Friends delighted to serve and\nreturn their choicest tennis balls of Elizabethan phrase. But little De\nQuincey could pull out the various stops of polyphonic prose even more\ncleverly than John Lyly; and if one will read the admirable description of\nSt. Mark’s in Can Grandel’s Castle, and then re-read Ruskin’s\ndescription of St. Mark’s, he will find that the Victorian’s orchestration\nof many-voiced prose does not suffer by comparison.",
        "Yet though it is true enough of the arts, as Chaucer wrote suavely long\nago, that “There nys no newe thing that is not olde,” we must remember\nthat the arts are always profiting by their naive rediscoveries. It is\nmore important that the thing should seem new than that it should really\nbe new, and the fresh sense of untried possibilities, the feeling that\nmuch land remains to be possessed, has given our contemporaries the\nspirits and the satisfactions of the pioneer. What matters it that a few\nantiquaries can trace on old maps the very rivers and harbors which the\nNew Verse believed itself to be exploring for the first time? Poetry does\nnot live by antiquarianism, but by the passionate conviction that all\nthings are made new through the creative imagination.",

        "THE FIELD OF LYRIC POETRY",
        "  “’Lyrical,’ it may be said, implies a form of musical utterance\n  in words governed by overmastering emotion and set free by a\n  powerfully concordant rhythm.\"\n    ERNEST RHYS, Lyric Poetry\nThat “confusion of the genres” which characterizes so much of contemporary\nart has not obliterated the ancient division of poetry into three chief\ntypes, namely, lyric, epic and dramatic. We still mean by these words very\nmuch what the Greeks meant: a “lyric” is something sung, an “epic” tells\na story, a “drama” sets characters in action. Corresponding to these\ngeneral purposes of the three kinds of poetry, is the difference which\nWatts-Dunton has discussed so suggestively: namely, that in the lyric the\nauthor reveals himself fully, while in the “epic” or narrative poem the\nauthor himself is but partly revealed, and in the drama the author is\nhidden behind his characters. Or, putting this difference in another way,\nthe same critic points out that the true dramatists possess “absolute\"\nvision, i.e. unconditioned by the personal impulses of the poet himself,\nwhereas the vision of the lyrist is “relative,” conditioned by his own\nsituation and mood. The pure lyrist, says Watts-Dunton, has one voice and\nsings one tune; the epic poets and quasi-dramatists have one voice but can\nsing several tunes, while the true dramatists, with their objective,\n\"absolute” vision of the world, have many tongues and can sing in all\ntunes.",
        "1. A Rough Classification\nPassing over the question of the historical origins of those various\nspecies of poetry, such as the relation of early hymnic songs and\nhero-songs to the epic, and the relation of narrative material and method\nto the drama, let us try to arrange in some sort of order the kinds of\npoetry with which we are familiar. Suppose we follow Watts-Dunton’s hint,\nand start, as if it were from a central point, with the Pure Lyric, the\nexpression of the Ego in song. Shelley’s “Stanzas Written in Dejection\nnear Naples,” Coleridge’s “Ode to Dejection,” Wordsworth’s “She dwelt\namong the untrodden ways,” Tennyson’s “Break–Break” will serve for\nillustrations. These are subjective, personal poems. Their vision\nis “relative” to the poet’s actual circumstances. Yet in a “dramatic\nlyric” like Byron’s “Isles of Greece” or Tennyson’s “Sir Galahad” it is\nclear that the poet’s vision is not occupied primarily with himself, but\nwith another person. In a dramatic monologue like Tennyson’s “Simeon\nStylites” or Browning’s “The Bishop orders his Tomb in St. Praxed’s\nChurch” it is not Tennyson and Browning themselves who are talking, but\nimaginary persons viewed objectively, as far as Tennyson and Browning were\ncapable of such objectivity. The next step would be the Drama, preoccupied\nwith characters in action–the “world of men,” in short, and not the\npersonal subjective world of the highly sensitized lyric poet.",
        "Let us now move away from that pure lyric centre in another direction. In\na traditional ballad like “Sir Patrick Spens,” a modern ballad like\nTennyson’s “The Revenge,” or Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner,” is not the\npoet’s vision becoming objectified, directed upon events or things outside\nof the circle of his own subjective emotion? In modern epic verse, like\nTennyson’s “Morte d’Arthur,” Arnold’s “Sohrab and Rustum,” Morris’s\n\"Sigurd the Volsung,” and certainly in the “Aeneid” and the “Song of\nRoland,” the poet sinks his own personality, as far as possible, in the\nobjective narration of events. And in like manner, the poet may turn from\nthe world of action to the world of repose, and portray Nature as\nenfolding and subduing the human element in his picture. In Keats’s “Ode\nto Autumn,” Shelley’s “Autumn,” in Wordsworth’s “Solitary Reaper,\"\nBrowning’s “Where the Mayne Glideth,” we find poets absorbed in the\nexternal scene or object and striving to paint it. It is true that the\nborn lyrists betray themselves constantly, that they suffuse both the\nworld of repose and the world of action with the coloring of their own\nunquiet spirits. They cannot keep themselves wholly out of the story they\nare telling or the picture they are painting; and it is for this reason\nthat we speak of “lyrical” passages even in the great objective dramas,\npassages colored with the passionate personal feelings of the poet. For he\ncannot be wholly “absolute” even if he tries: he will invent favorite\ncharacters and make them the mouthpiece of his own fancies: he will devise\nfavorite situations, and use them to reveal his moral judgment of men and\nwomen, and his general theory of human life.",
        "2. Definitions\nWhile we must recognize, then, that the meaning of the word “lyrical” has\nbeen broadened so as to imply, frequently, a quality of poetry rather than\na mere form of poetry, let us go back for a moment to the original\nsignificance of the word. Derived from “lyre,” it meant first a song\nwritten for musical accompaniment, say an ode of Pindar; then a poem whose\nform suggests this original musical accompaniment; then, more loosely, a\npoem which has the quality of music, and finally, purely personal poetry.\n[Footnote: See the definitions in John Erskine’s Elizabethan Lyric, E.\nB. Heed’s English Lyrical Poetry, Ernest Rhys’s Lyric Poetry, F. E.\nSchelling’s The English Lyric, John Drinkwater’s The Lyric, C. E.\nWhitmore in Pub. Mod. Lang. Ass., December, 1918.]\n\"All songs, all poems following classical lyric forms; all short poems\nexpressing the writer’s moods and feelings in rhythm that suggests music,\nare to be considered lyrics,” says Professor Reed. “The lyric is concerned\nwith the poet, his thoughts, his emotions, his moods, and his passions....\nWith the lyric subjective poetry begins,” says Professor Schelling. “The\ncharacteristic of the lyric is that it is the product of the pure poetic\nenergy unassociated with other energies,” says Mr. Drinkwater. These are\ntypical recent definitions. Francis T. Palgrave, in the Preface to the\nGolden Treasury of English Songs and Lyrics, while omitting to stress\nthe elements of musical quality and of personal emotion, gives a working\nrule for anthologists which has proved highly useful. He held the term\n\"lyrical” “to imply that each poem shall turn on a single thought, feeling\nor situation.” The critic Scherer also gave an admirable practical\ndefinition when he remarked that the lyric “reflects a situation or a\ndesire.” Keats’s sonnet “On first looking into Chapman’s Homer,” Charles\nKingsley’s “Airlie Beacon” and Whitman’s “O Captain! My Captain!” (Oxford\nBook of Verse, Nos. 634, 739 and 743) are suggestive illustrations of\nScherer’s dictum.",
        "3. General Characteristics\nBut the lyric, however it may be defined, has certain general\ncharacteristics which are indubitable. The lyric “vision,” that is to say,\nthe experience, thought, emotion which gives its peculiar quality to lyric\nverse, making it “simple, sensuous, passionate” beyond other species of\npoetry, is always marked by freshness, by egoism, and by genuineness.",
        "To the lyric poet all must seem new; each sunrise ’herrlich wie am ersten\nTag.” “Thou know’st ’tis common,” says Hamlet’s mother, speaking of his\nfather’s death, “Why seems it so particular with thee?” But to men of the\nlyrical temperament everything is “particular.” Age does not alter their\nexquisite sense of the novelty of experience. Tennyson’s lines on “Early\nSpring,” written at seventy-four, Browning’s “Never the Time and the\nPlace” written at seventy-two, Goethe’s love-lyrics written when he was\neighty, have all the delicate bloom of adolescence. Sometimes this\nfreshness seems due in part to the poet’s early place in the development\nof his national literature: he has had, as it were, the first chance at\nhis particular subject. There were countless springs, of course, before a\nnameless poet, about 1250, wrote one of the first English lyrics for which\nwe have a contemporary musical score:",
        "  “Sumer is icumen in,\n   Lhude sing cuccu.”",
        "But the words thrill the reader, even now, as he hears in fancy that\ncuckoo’s song,",
        "  “Breaking the silence of the seas\n   Beyond the farthest Hebrides.”",
        "Or, the lyric poet may have the luck to write at a period when settled,\nstilted forms of poetical expression are suddenly done away with. Perhaps\nhe may have helped in the emancipation, like Wordsworth and Coleridge in\nthe English Romantic Revival, or Victor Hugo in the France of 1830. The\nnew sense of the poetic possibilities of language reacts upon the\nimaginative vision itself. Free verse, in our own time, has profited by\nthis rejuvenation of the poetic vocabulary, by new phrases and cadences to\nmatch new moods. Sometimes an unwonted philosophical insight makes all\nthings new to the poet who possesses it. Thus Emerson’s vision of the\n\"Eternal Unity,” or Browning’s conception of Immortality, afford the very\nstuff out of which poetry may be wrought. Every new experience, in short,\nlike falling in love, like having a child, like getting “converted,\"\n[Footnote: See William James, The Varieties of Religious Experience.]\ngives the lyric poet this rapturous sense of living in a world hitherto\nunrealized. The old truisms of the race become suddenly “particular” to\nhim. “As for man, his days are as grass. As a flower of the field, so he\nflourisheth.” That was first a “lyric cry” out of the depths of some fresh\nindividual experience. It has become stale through repetition, but many a\nman, listening to those words read at the burial of a friend, has seemed,\nin his passionate sense of loss, to hear them for the first time.",
        "Egoism is another mark of the lyric poet. “Of every poet of this class,\"\nremarks Watts-Dunton, “it may be said that his mind to him ’a kingdom is,’\nand that the smaller the poet the bigger to him is that kingdom.” He\ncelebrates himself. Contemporary lyrists have left no variety of physical\nsensation unnoted: they tell us precisely how they feel and look when they\ntake their morning tub. Far from avoiding that “pathetic fallacy” which\nRuskin analysed in a famous chapter,\n[Footnote: Modern Painters, vol. 3, chap. 12.]\nand which attributes to the external world qualities which belong only to\nthe mind itself, they revel in it. “Day, like our souls, is fiercely\ndark,” sang Elliott, the Corn-Law Rhymer. Hamlet, it will be remembered,\ncould be lyrical enough upon occasion, but he retained the power of\ndistinguishing between things as they actually were and things as they\nappeared to him in his weakness and his melancholy. “This goodly frame,\nthe earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy,\nthe air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof\nfretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a\nfoul and pestilent congregation of vapors. What a piece of work is a man!\nHow noble in reason! how infinite in faculty!... And yet, to me,\nwhat is this quintessence of dust?”",
        "Nevertheless this lyric egoism has certain moods in which the individual\nidentifies himself with his family or tribe:",
        "  “O Keith of Ravelstone,\n   The sorrows of thy line!”",
        "School and college songs are often, in reality, tribal lyrics. The\nchoruses of Greek tragedies dealing with the guilt and punishment of a\nfamily, the Hebrew lyrics chanting, like “The Song of Deborah,” the\nfortunes of a great fight, often broaden their sympathies so as to\ninclude, as in “The Persians” of Aeschylus, the glory or the downfall of a\nrace. And this sense of identification with a nation or race implies no\nloss, but often an amplification of the lyric impulse. Alfred Noyes’s\nsongs about the English, D’Annunzio’s and Hugo’s splendid chants of the\nLatin races, Kipling’s glorification of the White Man, lose nothing of\ntheir lyric quality because of their nationalistic or racial inspiration.\nRead Wilfrid Blunt’s sonnet on “Gibraltar” (Oxford Book of Verse,\nNo. 821):",
        "  “Ay, this is the famed rock which Hercules\n   And Goth and Moor bequeath’d us. At this door\n   England stands sentry. God! to hear the shrill\n   Sweet treble of her fifes upon the breeze,\n   And at the summons of the rock gun’s roar\n   To see her red coats marching from the hill!”",
        "Are patriotic lyrics of this militant type destined to disappear, as\nTolstoy believed they ought to disappear, with the breaking-down of the\nbarriers of nationality, or rather with the coming of",
        "  “One common wave of thought and joy,\n   Lifting mankind again”",
        "over the barriers of nationality? Certainly there is already a type of\npurely humanitarian, altruistic lyric, where the poet instinctively thinks\nin terms of “us men” rather than of “I myself.” It appeared long ago in\nthat rebellious “Titanic” verse which took the side of oppressed mortals\nas against the unjust gods. Tennyson’s “Lotos-Eaters” is a modern echo of\nthis defiant or despairing cry of the “ill-used race of men.” The songs of\nBurns reveal ever-widening circles of sympathy,–pure personal egoism,\nthen songs of the family and of clan and of country-side, then passion for\nScotland, and finally this fierce peasant affection for his own passes\ninto the glorious",

        "            “the lyric gush,\n  And the wing-power, and the rush\n  Of the air.”",
        "Second-rate, imitative singers may indeed assume the role of genuine lyric\npoets, but they cannot play it without detection. It is literally true\nthat natural lyrists like Sappho, Burns, Goethe, Heine, “sing as the bird\nsings.” Once endowed with the lyric temperament and the command of\ntechnique, their cry of love or longing, of grief or patriotism, is the\ninevitable resultant from a real situation or desire. Sometimes, like\nchildren, they do not tell us very clearly what they are crying about, but\nit is easy to discover whether they are, like children, “making believe.”",
        "4. The Objects of the Lyric Vision\nLet us look more closely at some of the objects of the lyric vision; the\nsources or material, that is to say, for the lyric emotion. Goethe’s\noften-quoted classification is as convenient as any: the poet’s vision, he\nsays, may be directed upon Nature, Man or God.",
        "And first, then, upon Nature. One characteristic of lyric poetry is the\nclearness with which single details or isolated objects in Nature may be\nvisualized and reproduced. The modern reflective lyric, it is true, often\ndepends for its power upon some philosophical generalization from a single\ninstance, like Emerson’s “Rhodora” or Wordsworth’s “Small Celandine.” It\nmay even attempt a sort of logical or pseudo-logical deduction from given\npremises, like Browning’s famous",
        "  “Morning’s at seven;\n   The hillside’s dew-pearled;\n   The lark’s on the wing:\n   The snail’s on the thorn;\n   God’s in his Heaven–\n   All’s right with the world!“",
        "The imagination cannot be denied this right to synthesize and to\ninterpret, and nevertheless Nature offers even to the most unphilosophical\nher endless profusion of objects that awaken delight. She does not insist\nthat the lyric poet should generalize unless he pleases. Moth and snail\nand skylark, daisy and field-mouse and water-fowl, seized by an eye that\nis quick to their poetic values, their interest to men, furnish material\nenough for lyric feeling. The fondness of Romantic poets for isolating a\nsingle object has been matched in our day by the success of the Imagists\nin painting a single aspect of some phenomenon–",
        "  “Light as the shadow of the fish\n   That falls through the pale green water–”",
        "any aspect, in short, provided it affords the “romantic quiver,” the\nquick, keen sense of the beauty in things. What an art-critic said of the\npainter W. M. Chase applies equally well to many contemporary Imagists who\nuse the forms of lyric verse: “He saw the world as a display of beautiful\nsurfaces which challenged his skill. It was enough to set him painting to\nnote the nacreous skin of a fish, or the satiny bloom of fruit, or the\nwind-smoothed dunes about Shinnecock, or the fine specific olive of a\nwoman’s face.... He took objects quite at their face value, and rarely\ninvested them with the tenderness, mystery and understanding that comes\nfrom meditation and remembered feelings.... We get in him a fine, bare\nvision, and must not expect therewith much contributary enrichment from\nmind and mood.\"\n[Footnote: The Nation, November 2, 1916.]\nOur point is that this “fine, bare vision” is often enough for a lyric. It\nhas no time for epic breadth of detail, for the rich accumulation of\nharmonious images which marks Arnold’s “Sohrab and Rustum” or Keats’s “Eve\nof St. Agnes.”",
        "The English Romantic poets were troubled about the incursion of scientific\nfact into the poet’s view of nature. The awful rainbow in heaven might be\nturned, they thought, through the curse of scientific knowledge, into the\n\"dull catalogue of common things.” But Wordsworth was wiser than this. He\nsaw that if the scientific fact were emotionalized, it could still serve\nas the stuff of poetry. Facts could be transformed into truths. No aspect\nof Tennyson’s lyricism is more interesting than his constant employment of\nthe newest scientific knowledge of his day, for instance, in geology,\nchemistry and astronomy. He set his facts to music. Eugene Lee-Hamilton’s\npoignant sonnet about immortality is an illustration of the ease with\nwhich a lyric poet may find material in scientific fact, if appropriated\nand made rich by feeling.\n[Footnote: Quoted in chap. VIII, section 7.]",
        "If lyric poetry shows everywhere this tendency to humanize its “bare\nvision” of Nature, it is also clear that the lyric, as the most highly\npersonalized species of poetry, exhibits an infinite variety of visions of\nhuman life. Any anthology will illustrate the range of observation, the\ncomplexity of situations and desires, the constant changes in key, as the\nlyric attempts to interpret this or that aspect of human emotion. Take for\nexample, the Elizabethan love-lyric. Here is a single human passion,\nexpressing itself in the moods and lyric forms of one brief generation of\nour literature. Yet what variety of personal accent, what kaleidoscopic\nshiftings of mind and imagination, what range of lyric beauty! Or take the\npassion for the wider interests of Humanity, expressed in the lyrics of\nSchiller and Burns, running deep and turbid through Revolutionary\nand Romantic verse, and still coloring–perhaps now more strongly than\never–the stream of twentieth-century poetry. Here is a type of lyric\nemotion where self-consciousness is lost, absorbed in the wider\nconsciousness of kinship, in the dawning recognition of the oneness of the\nblood and fate of all nations of the earth.",
        "The purest type of lyric vision is indicated in the third word of Goethe’s\ntriad. It is the vision of God. Here no physical fact intrudes or mars.\nHere thought, if it be complete thought, is wholly emotionalized. Such\ntranscendent vision, as in the Hebrew lyrists and in Dante, is itself\nworship, and the lyric cry of the most consummate artist among English\npoets of the last generation is simply an echo of the ancient voices:",
        "  “Hallowed be Thy Name–Hallelujah!”",
        "If Tennyson could not phrase anew the ineffable, it is no wonder that most\nhymn-writers fail. They are trying to express in conventionalized\nreligious terminology and in “long and short metre” what can with\ndifficulty be expressed at all, and if at all, by the unconscious art of\nthe Psalms or by a sustained metaphor, like “Crossing the Bar” or the\n\"Recessional.” The medieval Latin hymns clothed their transcendent themes,\ntheir passionate emotions, in the language of imperial Rome. The modern\nsectaries succeed best in their hymnology when they choose simple ideas,\nnot too definite in content, and clothe them, as Whittier did, in words of\ntender human association, in parables of longing and of consolation.",
        "5. The Lyric Imagination\nThe material thus furnished by the lyric poet’s experience, thought and\nemotion is reshaped by an imagination working simply and spontaneously.\nThe lyrist is born and not made, and he cannot help transforming the\nactual world into his own world, like Don Quixote with the windmills and\nthe serving-women. Sometimes his imagination fastens upon a single trait\nor aspect of reality, and the resultant metaphor seems truer than any\nlogic.",
        "  “Death lays his icy hand on Kings.”",
        "  “I wandered lonely as a cloud.”",
        "Sometimes his imagination fuses various aspects of an object into a\ncomposite effect:",
        "  “A lily of a day\n  Is fairer far in May,\n  Although it fall and die that night;\n  It was the plant and flower of light.”",
        "The lyric emotion, it is true, does not always catch at imagery. It may\ndeal directly with the fact, as in Burns’s immortal",
        "  “If we ne’er had met sae kindly,\n  If we ne’er had loved sae blindly,\n  Never loved, and never parted,\n  We had ne’er been broken-hearted.”",
        "The lyric atmosphere, heavy and clouded with passionate feeling, idealizes\nobjects as if they were seen through the light of dawn or sunset. It is\nnever the dry clear light of noon.",
        "  “She was a phantom of delight.”",
        "  “Thy soul was like a star, and dwelt apart,\n  Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea,\n  Pure as the naked heavens....”",
        "This idealization is often not so much a magnification of the object as a\nsimplification of it. Confusing details are stripped away. Contradictory\nfacts are eliminated, until heart answers to heart across the welter of\nimmaterialities.",
        "Although the psychologists, as has been already noted, are now little\ninclined to distinguish between the imagination and the fancy, it remains\ntrue that the old distinction between superficial or “fanciful\"\nresemblances, and deeper or “imaginative” likenesses, is a convenient one\nin lyric poetry. E. C. Stedman, in his old age, was wont to say that our\nyounger lyrists, while tuneful and fanciful enough, had no imagination or\npassion, and that what was needed in America was some adult male verse.\nThe verbal felicity and richness of fancy that characterized the\nElizabethan lyric were matched by its sudden gleams of penetrative\nimagination, which may be, after all, only the “fancy” taking a deeper\nplunge. In the familiar song from The Tempest, for example, we have in\nthe second and third lines examples of those fanciful conceits in which\nthe age delighted, but that does not impair the purely imaginative beauty\nof the last three lines of the stanza,–the lines that are graven upon\nShelley’s tombstone in Rome:",
        "  “Full fathom five thy father lies;\n  Of his bones are coral made;\n  Those are pearls that were his eyes:\n  Nothing of him that doth fade\n  But doth suffer a sea-change\n  Into something rich and strange.”",
        "So it was that Hawthorne’s “fancy” first won a public for his stories,\nwhile it is by his imagination that he holds his place as an artist. For\nthe deeply imaginative line of lyric verse, like the imaginative\nconception of novelist or dramatist, often puzzles or repels a poet’s\ncontemporaries. Jeffrey could find no sense in Wordsworth’s superb couplet\nin the “Ode to Duty”:",
        "  “Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong;\n  And the most ancient heavens, through Thee, are\n    fresh and strong.”",
        "And oddly enough, Emerson, the one man upon this side of the Atlantic from\nwhom an instinctive understanding of those lines was to be expected, was\nas much perplexed by them as Jeffrey.",
        "6. Lyric Expression\nIs it possible to formulate the laws of lyric expression? “I do not mean\nby expression,” said Gray, “the mere choice of words, but the whole dress,\nfashion, and arrangement of a thought.\"\n[Footnote: Gray’s Letters, vol. 2, p. 333. (Gosse ed.)]\nTaking expression, in this larger sense, as the final element in that\nthreefold process by which poetry comes into being, and which has been\ndiscussed in an earlier chapter, we may assert that there are certain\ngeneral laws of lyric form. One of them is the law of brevity. It is\nimpossible to keep the lyric pitch for very long. The rapture turns to\npain. “I need scarcely observe,” writes Poe in his essay on “The Poetic\nPrinciple,” “that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it excites,\nby elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio of this\nelevating excitement. But all excitements are, through a psychical\nnecessity, transient. That degree of excitement which would entitle\na poem to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a\ncomposition of any great length. After the lapse of half an hour, at the\nvery utmost, it flags–fails–a revulsion ensues–and then the poem is, in\neffect, and in fact, no longer such.”",
        "In another passage, from the essay on “Hawthorne’s ’Twice-Told Tales,’\"\nPoe emphasizes this law of brevity in connection with the law of unity of\nimpression. It is one of the classic passages of American literary\ncriticism:",
        "  “Were we bidden to say how the highest genius could be most\n  advantageously employed for the best display of its own powers, we\n  should answer, without hesitation–in the composition of a rhymed poem,\n  not to exceed in length what might be perused in an hour. Within this\n  limit alone can the highest order of true poetry exist. We need only\n  here say, upon this topic, that, in almost all classes of composition,\n  the unity of effect or impression is a point of the greatest importance.\n  It is clear, moreover, that this unity cannot be thoroughly preserved in\n  productions whose perusal cannot be completed at one sitting. We may\n  continue the reading of a prose composition, from the very nature of\n  prose itself, much longer than we can preserve, to any good purpose, in\n  the perusal of a poem. This latter, if truly fulfilling the demands of\n  the poetic sentiment, induces an exaltation of the soul which cannot be\n  long sustained. All high excitements are necessarily transient. Thus a\n  long poem is a paradox. And, without unity of impression, the deepest\n  effects cannot be brought about. Epics were the offspring of an\n  imperfect sense of Art, and their reign is no more. A poem too brief\n  may produce a vivid, but never an intense or enduring impression.\n  Without a certain continuity of effort–without a certain duration or\n  repetition of purpose–the soul is never deeply moved.”",
        "Gray’s analysis of the law of lyric brevity is picturesque, and too little\nknown:",
        "  “The true lyric style, with all its flights of fancy, ornaments, and\n  heightening of expression, and harmony of sound, is in its nature\n  superior to every other style; which is just the cause why it could not\n  be borne in a work of great length, no more than the eye could bear to\n  see all this scene that we constantly gaze upon,–the verdure of the\n  fields and woods, the azure of the sea-skies, turned into one dazzling\n  expanse of gems. The epic, therefore, assumed a style of graver colors,\n  and only stuck on a diamond (borrowed from her sister) here and there,\n  where it best became her.... To pass on a sudden from the lyric glare to\n  the epic solemnity (if I may be allowed to talk nonsense)....\"\n[Footnote: Gray’s Letters, vol. 2, p. 304. (Gosse ed.)]",
        "It is evident that the laws of brevity and unity cannot be disassociated.\nThe unity of emotion which characterizes the successful lyric corresponds\nto the unity of action in the drama, and to the unity of effect in the\nshort story. It is this fact which Palgrave stressed in his emphasis upon\n\"some single thought, feeling, or situation.” The sonnets, for instance,\nthat most nearly approach perfection are those dominated by one thought.\nThis thought may be turned over, indeed, as the octave passes into the\nsextet, and may be viewed from another angle, or applied in an unexpected\nway. And yet the content of a sonnet, considered as a whole, must be as\nintegral as the sonnet’s form. So must it be with any song. The various\ndevices of rhyme, stanza and refrain help to bind into oneness of form a\nsingle emotional reflection of some situation or desire.",
        "Watts-Dunton points out that there is also a law of simplicity of\ngrammatical structure which the lyric disregards at its peril. Browning\nand Shelley, to mention no lesser names, often marred the effectiveness of\ntheir lyrics by a lack of perspicuity. If the lyric cry is not easily\nintelligible, the sympathy of the listener is not won. Riddle-poems have\nbeen loved by the English ever since Anglo-Saxon times, but the\nintellectual satisfaction of solving a puzzle may be purchased at the cost\nof true poetic pleasure. Let us quote Gray once more, for he had an\nunerring sense of the difficulty of moulding ideas into “pure, perspicuous\nand musical form.”",
        "  “Extreme conciseness of expression, yet pure, perspicuous, and musical,\n  is one of the grand beauties of lyric poetry. This I have always aimed\n  at, and never could attain; the necessity of rhyming is one great\n  obstacle to it: another and perhaps a stronger is, that way you have\n  chosen of casting down your first ideas carelessly and at large, and\n  then clipping them here and there, and forming them at leisure; this\n  method, after all possible pains, will leave behind it in some places a\n  laxity, a diffuseness; the frame of a thought (otherwise well invented,\n  well turned, and well placed) is often weakened by it. Do I talk\n  nonsense, or do you understand me?\"\n[Footnote: Gray’s Letters, vol. 2, p. 352. (Gosse ed.)]",
        "Poe, whose theory of poetry comprehends only the lyric, and indeed chiefly\nthat restricted type of lyric verse in which he himself was a master,\ninsisted that there was a further lyric law,–the law of vagueness or\nindefiniteness. “I know,” he writes in his “Marginalia,” “that\nindefiniteness is an element of the true music–I mean of the true musical\nexpression. Give to it any undue decision–imbue it with any very\ndeterminate tone–and you deprive it, at once, of its ethereal, its ideal,\nits intrinsic and essential character. You dispel its luxury of dream. You\ndissolve the atmosphere of the mystic upon which it floats. You exhaust it\nof its breath of faëry. It now becomes a tangible and easily appreciable\nidea–a thing of the earth, earthy.”",
        "This reads like a defence of Poe’s own private practice, and yet many\npoets and critics are inclined to side with him. Edmond Holmes, for\ninstance, goes quite as far as Poe. “The truth is that poetry, which is\nthe expression of large, obscure and indefinable feelings, finds its\nappropriate material in vague words–words of large import and with many\nmeanings and shades of meaning. Here we have an almost unfailing test for\ndetermining the poetic fitness of words, a test which every true poet\nunconsciously, but withal unerringly, applies. Precision, whether in the\ndirection of what is commonplace or of what is technical, is always\nunpoetical.\"\n[Footnote: What is Poetry, p. 77. London and New York, 1900.]\nThis doctrine, it will be observed, is in direct opposition to the Imagist\ntheory of “hardness and economy of speech; the exact word,” and it also\nwould rule out the highly technical vocabulary of camp and trail,\nsteamship and jungle, with which Mr. Kipling has greatly delighted our\ngeneration. No one who admires the splendid vitality of “McAndrew’s Hymn\"\nis really troubled by the slang and lingo of the engine-room.",
        "One of the most charming passages in Stedman’s Nature and Elements of\nPoetry (pp. 181-85) deals with the law of Evanescence. The “flowers that\nfade,” the “airs that die,” “the snows of yester-year,” have in their very\nfrailty and mortality a haunting lyric value. Don Marquis has written a\npoem about this exquisite appeal of the transient, calling it “The\nParadox”:",
        "  “’T is evanescence that endures;\n  The loveliness that dies the soonest has the longest life.”",
        "But we touch here a source of lyric beauty too delicate to be analysed in\nprose. It is better to read “Rose Aylmer,” or to remember what Duke Orsino\nsays in Twelfth Night:",
        "                  “Enough; no more:\n  ’T is not so sweet now as it was before.”",
        "7. Expression and Impulse\nA word must be added, nevertheless, about lyric expression as related to\nthe lyric impulse. No one pretends that there is such a thing as a set\nlyric pattern.",
        "  “There are nine-and-sixty ways of constructing tribal lays,\n  And every single one of them is right.”",
        "No two professional golfers, for instance, take precisely the same stance.\nEach man’s stance is the expression, the result, of his peculiar physical\norganization and his muscular habits. There are as many “styles” as there\nare players, and yet each player strives for “style,” i.e. economy and\nprecision and grace of muscular effort, and each will assert that the\nchief thing is to “keep your eye on the ball” and “follow through.” “And\nevery single one of them is right.”",
        "Apply this analogy to the organization of a lyric poem. Its material, as\nwe have seen, is infinitely varied. It expresses all conceivable “states\nof soul.” Is it possible, therefore, to lay down any general formula for\nit, something corresponding to the golfer’s “keep your eye on the ball\"\nand “follow through”? John Erskine, in his book on The Elizabethan\nLyric, ventures upon this precept: “Lyric emotion, in order to express\nitself intelligibly, must first reproduce the cause of its existence. If\nthe poet will go into ecstasies over a Grecian urn, to justify himself he\nmust first show us the urn.” Admitted. Can one go farther? Mr. Erskine\nattempts it, in a highly suggestive analysis:\n\"Speaking broadly, all successful lyrics have three parts. In the first\nthe emotional stimulus is given–the object, the situation, or the thought\nfrom which the song arises. In the second part the emotion is developed to\nits utmost capacity, until as it begins to flag the intellectual element\nreasserts itself. In the third part the emotion is finally resolved into a\nthought, a mental resolution, or an attribute.\"\n[Footnote: The Elizabethan Lyric, p. 17.]\nLet the reader choose at random a dozen lyrics from the Golden Treasury,\nand see how far this orderly arrangement of the thought-stuff of the lyric\nis approximated in practice. My own impression is that the critic\npostulates more of an “intellectual element” than the average English song\nwill supply. But at least here is a clear-cut statement of what one may\nlook for in a lyric. It shows how the lyric impulse tends to mould lyric\nexpression into certain lines of order.",
        "Most of the narrower precepts governing lyric form follow from the general\nprinciples already discussed. The lyric vocabulary, every one admits,\nshould not seem studied or consciously ornate, for that breaks the law of\nspontaneity. It may indeed be highly finished, the more highly in\nproportion to its brevity, but the clever word-juggling of such\nprestidigitators as Poe and Verlaine is perilous. Figurative language must\nspring only from living, figurative thought, otherwise the lyric falls\ninto verbal conceits, frigidity, conventionality. Stanzaic law must follow\nemotional law, just as Kreisler’s accompanist must keep time with\nKreisler. All the rich devices of rhyme and tone-color must heighten\nand not cloy the singing quality. But why lengthen this list of truisms?\nThe combination of genuine lyric emotion with expertness of technical\nexpression is in reality very rare. Goethe’s “Ueber alien Gipfeln ist Ruh\"\nand Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan” are miracles of art, yet one was scribbled in\na moment, and the other dreamed in an opium slumber. The lyric is the\ncommonest, and yet, in its perfection, the rarest type of poetry; the\nearliest, and yet the most modern; the simplest, and yet in its laws of\nemotional association, perhaps the most complex; and it is all these\nbecause it expresses, more intimately than other types of verse, the\npersonality of the poet.",
        "RELATIONSHIPS AND TYPES OF THE LYRIC",
        "  ’Milk-Woman. What song was it, I pray? Was it ’Come, shepherds, deck\n  your heads’? or, ’As at noon Dulcina rested’? or, ’Phillida flouts me’?\n  or, ’Chevy Chase’? or, ’Johnny Armstrong’? or, ’Troy Town’?\"\n    ISAAC WALTON, The Complete Angler\nWe have already considered, at the beginning of the previous chapter, the\ngeneral relationship of the three chief types of poetry. Lyric, epic and\ndrama, i.e. song, story and play, have obviously different functions to\nperform. They may indeed deal with a common fund of material. A given\nevent, say the settlement of Virginia, or the episode of Pocahontas,\nprovides situations and emotions which may take either lyric or narrative\nor dramatic shape. The mental habits and technical experience of the poet,\nor the prevalent literary fashions of his day, may determine which general\ntype of poetry he will employ. There were born lyrists, like Greene in the\nElizabethan period, who wrote plays because the public demanded drama, and\nthere have been natural dramatists who were compelled, in a period when\nthe theatre fell into disrepute, to give their material a narrative form.\nBut we must also take into account the dominant mood or quality of certain\npoetic minds. Many passages in narrative and dramatic verse, for instance,\nwhile fulfilling their primary function of telling a story or throwing\ncharacters into action, are colored by what we have called the lyric\nquality, by that passionate, personal feeling whose natural mode of\nexpression is in song. In Marlowe’s Tamburlaine, for instance, or Victor\nHugo’s Hernani, there are superb pieces of lyric declamation, in which\nwe feel that Marlowe and Hugo themselves–not the imaginary Tamburlaine\nand Hernani–are chanting the desires of their own hearts. Arnold’s\n\"Sohrab and Rustum,” after finishing its tragic story of the son slain by\nthe unwitting father, closes with a lyric description of the majestic Oxus\nstream flowing on to the Aral sea. Objective as it all seems, this close\nis intensely personal, permeated with the same tender stoicism which\ncolors Arnold’s “Dover Beach” and “A Summer Night.” The device of using a\nNature picture at the end of a narrative, to heighten, by harmony or\ncontrast, the mood induced by the story itself, was freely utilized\nby Tennyson in his English Idylls, such as “Audley Court,” “Edwin\nMorris,” “Love and Duty,” and “The Golden Year.” It adds the last touch of\npoignancy to Robert Frost’s “Death of the Hired Man.” These descriptive\npassages, though lacking the song form, are as purely lyrical in their\nfunction as the songs in The Princess or the songs in The Winter’s\nTale.",
        "1. The Blending of Types\nWhile the scope of the present volume, as explained in the Preface,\nprecludes any specific study of drama and epic, the reader must bear in\nmind that the three main types of poetry are not separated, in actual\npractice, by immovably hard and fast lines. Pigeonhole classifications of\ndrama, epic and lyric types are highly convenient to the student for\npurposes of analysis. But the moment one reads a ballad like “Edward,\nEdward” (Oxford, No. 373) or “Helen of Kirconnell” (Oxford, No. 387)\nthe pigeon-hole distinctions must be subordinated to the actual fact that\nthese ballads are a blend of drama, story and song. The “form” is lyrical,\nthe stuff is narrative, the mode of presentation is often that of purely\ndramatic dialogue.",
        "Take a contemporary illustration of this blending of types. Mr. Vachel\nLindsay has told us the origins of his striking poem “The Congo.” He was\nalready in a “national-theme mood,” he says, when he listened to a sermon\nabout missionaries on the Congo River. The word “Congo” began to haunt\nhim. “It echoed with the war-drums and cannibal yells of Africa.” Then,\nfor a list of colors for his palette, he had boyish memories of Stanley’s\nDarkest Africa, and of the dances of the Dahomey Amazons at the World’s\nFair in Chicago. He had seen the anti-negro riots in Springfield,\nIllinois. He had gone through a score of negro-saloons–\"barrel-houses\"–\non Eleventh Avenue, New York, and had “accumulated a jungle impression\nthat remains with me yet.” Above all, there was Conrad’s Heart of\nDarkness. “I wanted to reiterate the word Congo–and the several refrains\nin a way that would echo stories like that. I wanted to suggest\nthe terror, the reeking swamp-fever, the forest splendor, the\nblack-lacquered loveliness, and above all the eternal fatality of Africa,\nthat Conrad has written down with so sure a hand. I do not mean to say,\nnow that I have done, that I recorded all these things in rhyme. But every\ntime I rewrote ’The Congo’ I reached toward them. I suppose I rewrote it\nfifty times in these two months, sometimes three times in one day.”",
        "It is not often that we get so veracious an account of the making\nof a poem, so clear a conception of the blending of sound-motives,\ncolor-motives, story-stuff, drama-stuff, personal emotion, into a single\nwhole.",
        "Nor is there any clear separation of types when we strive to look back to\nthe primitive origins of these various forms of poetry. In the opinion of\nmany scholars, the origins are to be traced to a common source in the\ndance. “Dances, as overwhelming evidence, ethnological and sociological,\ncan prove, were the original stuff upon which dramatic, lyric and epic\nimpulses wove a pattern that is traced in later narrative ballads mainly\nas incremental repetition. Separation of its elements, and evolution to\nhigher forms, made the dance an independent art, with song, and then\nmusic, ancillary to the figures and the steps; song itself passed to lyric\ntriumphs quite apart from choral voice and choral act; epic went its\nartistic way with nothing but rhythm as memorial of the dance, and the\nstory instead of dramatic situation; drama retained the situation, the\naction, even the chorus and the dance, but submitted them to the shaping\nand informing power of individual genius.\"\n[Footnote: Gummere, The Popular Ballad, p. 106.]\nIn another striking passage, Professor Gummere asks us to visualize “a\nthrong of people without skill to read or write, without ability to\nproject themselves into the future, or to compare themselves with the\npast, or even to range their experience with the experience of other\ncommunities, gathered in festal mood, and by loud song, perfect rhythm and\nenergetic dance, expressing their feelings over an event of quite local\norigin, present appeal and common interest. Here, in point of evolution,\nis the human basis of poetry, the foundation courses of the pyramid.”",
        "2. Lyrical Element in Drama\nWe cannot here attempt to trace, even in outline, the course of this\nhistoric evolution of genres. But in contemporary types of both dramatic\nand narrative poetry, there may still be discovered the influence of lyric\nform and mood. We have already noted how the dramatist, for all of his\nsupposed objectivity, cannot refrain from coloring certain persons and\nsituations with the hues of his own fancy. Ibsen, for instance, injects\nhis irony, his love for symbolism, his theories for the reconstruction of\nsociety, into the very blood and bone of his characters and into the\nstructure of his plots. So it is with Shaw, with Synge, with Hauptmann,\nwith Brieux. Even if their plays are written in prose, these men\nare still “makers,” and the prose play may be as highly subjective in\nmood, as definitely individual in phrasing, as full of atmosphere, as if\nit were composed in verse.",
        "But the lyric possibilities of the drama are more easily realized if we\nturn from the prose play to the play in verse, and particularly to those\nElizabethan dramas which are not only poetical in essence, but which\nutilize actual songs for their dramatic value. No less than thirty-six of\nShakspere’s plays contain stage-directions for music, and his marvelous\ncommand of song-words is universally recognized. The English stage had\nmade use of songs, in fact, ever since the liturgical drama of the Middle\nAges. But Shakspere’s unrivalled knowledge of stage-craft, as well as\nhis own instinct for harmonizing lyrical with theatrical effects, enabled\nhim to surpass all of his contemporaries in the art of using songs to\nbring actors on and off the stage, to anticipate following action, to\ncharacterize personages, to heighten climaxes, and to express motions\nbeyond the reach of spoken words.\n[Footnote: These points are fully discussed in J. Robert Moore’s Harvard\ndissertation (unpublished) on The Songs in the English Drama.]\nThe popularity of such song-forms as the “madrigal,” which was sung\nwithout musical accompaniment, made it easy for the public stage to cater\nto the prevalent taste. The “children of the Chapel” or “of Paul’s,” who\nserved as actors in the early Elizabethan dramas, were trained choristers,\nand songs were a part of their stock in trade. Songs for sheer\nentertainment, common enough upon the stage when Shakspere began to write,\nturned in his hands into exquisite instruments of character revelation and\nof dramatic passion, until they became, on the lips of an Ophelia or a\nDesdemona, the most touching and poignant moments of the drama. “Music\nwithin” is a frequent stage direction in the later Elizabethan plays, and\nif one remembers the dramatic effectiveness of the Easter music,\noff-stage, in Goethe’s Faust, or the horn in Hernani, one can\nunderstand how Wagner came to believe that a blending of music with poetry\nand action, as exhibited in his “music-dramas,” was demanded by the ideal\nrequirements of dramatic art. Wagner’s theory and practice need not be\nrehearsed here. It is sufficient for our purpose to recall the\nindisputable fact that in some of the greatest plays ever written, lyric\nforms have contributed richly and directly to the total dramatic effect.",
        "3. The Dramatic Monologue\nThere is still another genre of poetry, however, where the\ninter-relations of drama, of narrative, and of lyric mood are peculiarly\ninteresting. It is the dramatic monologue. The range of expressiveness\nallowed by this type of poetry was adequately shown by Browning and\nTennyson, and recent poets like Edwin Arlington Robinson, Robert Frost\nand Amy Lowell have employed it with consummate skill. The dramatic\nmonologue is a dynamic revelation of a soul in action, not a mere static\nbit of character study. It chooses some representative and specific\noccasion,–let us say a man’s death-bed view of his career, as in “The\nBishop orders his Tomb” or the first “Northern Farmer.” It is something\nmore than a soliloquy overheard. There is a listener, who, though without\na speaking part, plays a very real role in the dialogue. For the dramatic\nmonologue is in essence a dialogue of which we hear only the chief\nspeaker’s part, as in “My Last Duchess,” or in E. A. Robinson’s “Ben\nJonson Entertains a Man from Stratford.” It is as if we were watching and\nlistening to a man telephoning. Though we see and hear but one person, we\nare aware that the talk is shaped to a certain extent by the personality\nat the other end of the line. In Tennyson’s “Rizpah,” for example, the\ncharacteristics of the well-meaning, Bible-quoting parish visitor\ndetermine some of the finest lines in the old mother’s response. In\nBrowning’s “Andrea del Sarto” the painter’s wife, Lucrezia, says never a\nword, but she has a more intense physical presence in that poem than many\nof the dramatis personae of famous plays. Tennyson’s “Ulysses” and “Sir\nGalahad” and “The Voyage of Maeldune” are splendid soliloquies and nothing\nmore. The first “Locksley Hall” is likewise a soliloquy, but in the second\n\"Locksley Hall” and “To-Morrow,” where scraps of talk from the unseen\ninterlocutor are caught up and repeated by the speaker in passionate\nrebuttal, we have true drama of the “confrontation\" type. We see a whole\nsoul in action.",
        "Now this intense, dynamic fashion of revealing character through narrative\ntalk–and it is commonly a whole life-story which is condensed within the\nfew lines of a dramatic monologue–touches lyricism at two points. The\nfirst is the fact that many dramatic monologues use distinctively lyric\nmeasures. The six-stress anapestic line which Tennyson preferred for his\nlater dramatic monologues like “Rizpah” is really a ballad measure, and is\nseen as such to its best advantage in “The Revenge.” But in his monologues\nof the pure soliloquy type, like “St. Agnes” and “Sir Galahad,” the metre\nis brilliantly lyrical, and the lyric associations of the verse are\ncarried over into the mood of the poem. And the other fact to be\nremembered is that the poignant self-analysis and self-betrayal of the\ndramatic monologue, its “egoism” and its ultimate and appalling\nsincerities, are a part of the very nature of the lyric impulse. These\nrevealers of their souls may use the speaking, rather than the singing\nvoice, but their tones have the deep, rich lyric intimacy.",
        "4. Lyric and Narrative\nIn narrative poetry, no less than in drama, we must note the intrusion of\nthe lyric mood, as well as the influence of lyric forms. Theoretically,\nnarrative or “epic” poetry is based upon an objective experience.\nSomething has happened, and the poet tells us about it. He has heard or\nread, or possibly taken part in, an event, and the event, rather than the\npoet’s thought or feeling about it, is the core of the poem. But as soon\nas he begins to tell his tale, we find that he is apt to “set it out” with\nvivid description. He is obliged to paint a picture as well as to spin a\nyarn, and not even Homer and Virgil–\"objective” as they are supposed to\nbe–-can draw a picture without betraying something of their attitude and\nfeeling towards their material. Like the messenger in Greek drama,\ntheir voices are shaken by what they have seen or heard. In the popular\nepic like the Nibelungen story, there is more objectivity than in the epic\nof art like Jerusalem Delivered or Paradise Lost. We do not know who\nput together in their present form such traditional tales as the Lay of\nthe Nibelungs and Beowulf, and the personal element in the narrative is\nonly obscurely felt, whereas Jerusalem Delivered is a constant\nrevelation of Tasso, and the personality of Milton colors every line in\nParadise Lost. When Matthew Arnold tells us that Homer is rapid, plain,\nsimple and noble, he is depicting the characteristics of a poet as well as\nthe impression made by the Iliad and the Odyssey. Those general traits\nof epic poetry which have been discussed ever since the Renaissance, like\n\"breadth,” and “unity” and the sustained “grand\" style, turn ultimately\nupon the natural qualities of great story-tellers. They are not mere\nrhetorical abstractions.",
        "The narrative poet sees man as accomplishing a deed, as a factor in an\nevent. His primary business is to report action, not to philosophize or to\ndissect character or to paint landscape. Yet so sensitive is he to the\nenvironing circumstances of action, and so bent upon displaying the\nvarieties of human motive and conduct, that he cannot help reflecting in\nhis verse his own mental attitude toward the situations which he depicts.\nHe may surround these situations, as we have seen, with all the beauties\nand pomps and terrors of the visible world. In relating “God’s ways to\nman” he instinctively justifies or condemns. He cannot even tell a story\nexactly as it was told to him: he must alter it, be it ever so slightly,\nto make it fit his general conceptions of human nature and human fate. He\ngives credence to one witness and not to another. His imagination plays\naround the noble and base elements in his story until their original\nproportions are altered to suit his mind and purpose. Study the Tristram\nstory, as told by Gottfried of Strassburg, by Malory, Tennyson,\nArnold, Swinburne and Wagner, and you will see how each teller betrays his\nown personality through these instinctive processes of transformation of\nhis material. It is like the Roman murder story told so many times over in\nBrowning’s Ring and the Book: the main facts are conceded by each\nwitness, and yet the inferences from the facts range from Heaven to Hell.",
        "Browning is of course an extreme instance of this irruption of the poet’s\npersonality upon the stuff of his story. He cannot help lyricising and\ndramatizing his narrative material, any more than he can help making all\nhis characters talk “Browningese.” But Byron’s tales in verse show the\nsame subjective tendency. He was so little of a dramatist that all of his\nheroes, like Poe’s, are images of himself. No matter what the raw material\nof his narrative poems may be, they become uniformly “Byronic” as he\nwrites them down. And all this is “lyricism,” however disguised. William\nMorris, almost alone among modern English poets, seemed to stand gravely\naloof from the tales he told, as his master Chaucer stood smilingly aloof.\nYet the “tone” of Chaucer is perceived somehow upon every page, in spite\nof his objectivity.",
        "The whole history of medieval verse Romances, indeed, illustrates this\nlyrical tendency to rehandle inherited material. Tales of love, of\nenchantment, of adventure, could not be held down to prosaic fact. Whether\nthey dealt with “matter of France,” or “matter of Brittany,” whether a\nbrief “lai” or a complicated cycle of stories like those about Charlemagne\nor King Arthur, whether a merry “fabliau” or a beast-tale like “Reynard\nthe Fox,” all the Romances allow to the author a margin of mystery, an\nopportunity to weave his own web of brightly colored fancies. A specific\nevent or legend was there, of course, as a nucleus for the story, but the\nsense of wonder, of strangeness in things, of individual delight in\nbrocading new patterns upon old material, dominated over the sense of\nfact. “Time,” said Shelley, “which destroys the beauty and the use of the\nstory of particular facts, stripped of the poetry which should invest\nthem, augments that of poetry, and forever develops new and wonderful\napplications of the eternal truth which it contains....  A story of\nparticular facts is as a mirror which obscures and distorts that which\nshould be beautiful: poetry is a mirror which makes beautiful that which\nis distorted.”",
        "And in modern narrative verse, surely, the line between “epic” quality and\n\"lyric” quality is difficult to draw. Choose almost at random a half-dozen\nstory-telling poems from the Oxford Book of English Verse, say “The\nAncient Mariner,” “The Burial of Sir John Moore,” “La Belle Dame sans\nMerci,” “Porphyria’s Lover,” “The Forsaken Merman,” “He Fell among\nThieves.” Each of these poems narrates an event, but what purely lyric\nquality is there which cannot be found in “La Belle Dame sans Merci” and\n\"The Ancient Mariner”? And does not each of the other poems release and\nexcite the lyric mood?",
        "We must admit, furthermore, that narrative measures and lyric measures are\nfrequently identical, and help to carry over into a story a singing\nquality. Ballad measures are an obvious example. Walter Scott’s facile\ncouplets were equally effective for story and for song. Many minor species\nof narrative poetry, like verse satire and allegory, are often composed in\ntraditional lyric patterns. Even blank verse, admirably suited as it is\nfor story-telling purposes, yields in its varieties of cadence many a bar\nof music long associated with lyric emotion. Certainly the blank verse of\nWordsworth’s “Michael” is far different in its musical values from the\nblank verse, say, of Tennyson’s Princess–perhaps truly as different as\nthe metre of Sigurd the Volsung is from that of The Rape of the Lock.\nThe perfect matching of metrical form to the nature of the narrative\nmaterial, whether that material be traditional or firsthand, simple or\ncomplex, rude or delicate, demands the finest artistic instinct. Yet it\nappears certain that many narrative measures affect us fully as\nmuch through their intimate association with the moods of song as through\ntheir specific adaptiveness to the purposes of narrative.",
        "5. The Ballad\nThe supreme illustration of this blending of story and song is the ballad.\nThe word “ballad,” like “ode” and “sonnet,” is very ancient and has been\nused in various senses. We think of it to-day as a song that tells a\nstory, usually of popular origin. Derived etymologically from ballare,\nto dance, it means first of all, a “dance-song,” and is the same word as\n\"ballet.” Solomon’s “Song of Songs” is called in the Bishops’ Bible of\n1568 “The Ballet of Ballets of King Solomon.” But in Chaucer’s time a\n\"ballad” meant primarily a French form of lyric verse,–not a narrative\nlyric specifically. In the Elizabethan period the word was used loosely\nfor “song.” Only after the revival of interest in English and Scottish\npopular ballads in the eighteenth century has the word come gradually to\nimply a special type of story-telling song, with no traces of individual\nauthorship, and handed down by oral tradition. Scholars differ as to\nthe precise part taken by the singing, dancing crowd in the composition\nand perpetuation of these traditional ballads. Professor Child,\nthe greatest authority upon English and Scottish balladry, and\nProfessors Gummere, Kittredge and W. M. Hart have emphasized the\nelement of “communal” composition, and illustrated it by many types of\nsong-improvisation among savage races, by sailors’ “chanties,” and negro\n\"work-songs.” It is easy to understand how a singing, dancing crowd\ncarries a refrain, and improvises, through some quick-tongued individual,\na new phrase, line or stanza of immediate popular effect; and it is also\neasy to perceive, by a study of extant versions of various ballads, such\nas Child printed in glorious abundance, to see how phrases, lines and\nstanzas get altered as they are passed from lip to lip of unlettered\npeople during the course of centuries. But the actual historical\nrelationship of communal dance-songs to such narrative lyrics as were\ncollected by Bishop Percy, Ritson and Child is still under debate.\n[Footnote: See Louise Pound, “The Ballad and the Dance,” Pub. Mod. Lang.\nAss., vol. 34, No. 3 (September, 1919), and Andrew Lang’s article on\n\"Ballads” in Chambers’ Cyclopedia of Eng. Lit., ed. of 1902.]",
        "“All poetry,” said Professor Gummere in reply to a critic of his theory of\ncommunal composition of ballads, “springs from the same poetic impulse,\nand is due to individuals; but the conditions under which it is made,\nwhether originally composed in a singing, dancing throng and submitted to\noral tradition, or set down on paper by the solitary and deliberate poet,\nhave given birth to that distinction of ’popular’ and ’artistic,’ or\nwhatever the terms may be, which has obtained in some form with nearly all\nwriters on poetry since Aristotle.” Avoiding questions that are still in\ncontroversy, let us look at some of the indubitable characteristics of the\n\"popular” ballads as they are shown in Child’s collection.\n[Footnote: Now reprinted in a single volume of the “Cambridge Poets\"\n(Houghton Mifflin Company), edited with an introduction by G. L.\nKittredge.]\nThey are impersonal. There is no trace whatever of individual authorship.\n\"This song was made by Billy Gashade,” asserts the author of the immensely\npopular American ballad of “Jesse James.” But we do not know what “Billy\nGashade” it was who first made rhymes about Robin Hood or Johnny\nArmstrong, or just how much help he had from the crowd in composing them.\nIn any case, the method of such ballads is purely objective. They do not\nmoralize or sentimentalize. There is little description, aside from the\nuse of set, conventional phrases. They do not “motivate” the story\ncarefully, or move logically from event to event. Rather do they “flash\nthe story at you” by fragments, and then leave you in the dark. They\nleap over apparently essential points of exposition and plot structure;\nthey omit to assign dialogue to a specific person, leaving you to guess\nwho is talking. Over certain bits of action or situation they linger as if\nthey hated to leave that part of the story. They make shameless use of\n\"commonplaces,” that is, stock phrases, lines or stanzas which are\nconveniently held by the memory and which may appear in dozens of\ndifferent ballads. They are not afraid of repetition,–indeed the theory\nof choral collaboration implies a constant use of repetition and refrain,\nas in a sailor’s “chanty.” One of their chief ways of building a situation\nor advancing a narrative is through “incremental repetition,” as Gummere\ntermed it, i.e. the successive additions of some new bits of fact as the\nbits already familiar are repeated.",

        "Strikingly as the ballads differ from consciously “artistic” narrative in\ntheir broken movement and allusive method, the contrast is even more\ndifferent if we consider the naive quality of their refrains. Sometimes\nthe refrain is only a sort of musical accompaniment:",

        "It is through the choral refrains, in fact, that the student of lyric\npoetry is chiefly fascinated as he reads the ballads. Students of epic\nand drama find them peculiarly suggestive in their handling of narrative\nand dramatic material, while to students of folklore and of primitive\nsociety they are inexhaustible treasures. The mingling of dance-motives\nand song-motives with the pure story-element may long remain obscure, but\nthe popular ballad reinforces, perhaps more persuasively than any type of\npoetry, the conviction that the lyrical impulse is universal and\ninevitable. As Andrew Lang, scholar and lover of balladry, wrote\nlong ago: “Ballads sprang from the very heart of the people and flit from\nage to age, from lip to lip of shepherds, peasants, nurses, of all the\nclass that continues nearest to the state of natural man. The whole soul\nof the peasant class breathes in their burdens, as the great sea resounds\nin the shells cast up on the shores. Ballads are a voice from secret\nplaces, from silent peoples and old times long dead; and as such they stir\nus in a strangely intimate fashion to which artistic verse can never\nattain.\"\n[Footnote: Encyclopaedia Brittanica, article “Ballads.\"]",
        "6. The Ode\nIf the ballad is thus an example of “popular” lyricism, with a narrative\nintention, an example of “artistic” lyricism is found in the Ode. Here\nthere is no question of communal origins or of communal influence upon\nstructure. The ode is a product of a single artist, working not naively,\nbut consciously, and employing a highly developed technique. Derived from\nthe Greek verb meaning “to sing,” the word “ode” has not changed its\nmeaning since the days of Pindar, except that, as in the case of the word\n\"lyric” itself, we have gradually come to grow unmindful of the original\nmusical accompaniment of the song. Edmund Gosse, in his collection of\nEnglish Odes, defines the ode as “any strain of enthusiastic and exalted\nlyrical verse directed to a fixed purpose and dealing progressively with\none dignified theme.” Spenser’s “Epithalamium” or marriage ode,\nWordsworth’s “Ode on the Intimations of Immortality,” Tennyson’s elegiac\nand encomiastic “Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington,” Lowell’s\n\"Harvard Commemoration Ode,” are among the most familiar examples of the\ngeneral type.",
        "English poetry has constantly employed, however, both of the two metrical\nspecies of odes recognized by the ancients. The first, made up of uniform\nstanzas, was called “Aeolian” or “Horatian,\"–since Horace imitated the\nsimple, regular strophes of his Greek models. The other species of ode,\nthe “Dorian,” is more complex, and is associated with the triumphal odes\nof Pindar. It utilizes groups of voices, and its divisions into so-called\n\"strophe,” “antistrophe” and “epode” (sometimes called fancifully “wave,\"\n\"answering wave” and “echo”) were determined by the movements of the\ngroups of singers upon the Greek stage, the “singers moving to one side\nduring the strophe, retracing their steps during the antistrophe (which\nwas for that reason metrically identical with the strophe), and standing\nstill during the epode.\"\n[Footnote: See Bronson’s edition of the poems of Collins. Athenaeum\nPress.]",
        "It must be observed, however, that the English odes written in strictly\nuniform stanzas differ greatly in the simplicity of the stanzaic pattern.\nAndrew Marvell’s “Horatian Ode upon Cromwell’s Return from Ireland,\"\nCollins’s “Ode to Evening,” Shelley’s “To a Skylark,” and Wordsworth’s\n\"Ode to Duty” are all in very simple stanza forms. But Collins’s “Ode on\nthe Superstitions of the Highlands,” Shelley’s “Ode to Liberty” and\nColeridge’s “Ode to France” follow very complicated patterns, though all\nthe stanzas are alike. The English “Horatian” ode, then, while exhibiting\nthe greatest differences in complexity of stanzaic forms, is\n\"homostrophic.”",
        "To understand the “Pindaric” English ode, we must remember that a few\nscholars, like Ben Jonson, Congreve and Gray, took peculiar pleasure in\nreproducing the general effect of the Greek strophic arrangement of\n\"turn,” “counterturn” and “pause.” Ben Jonson’s “Ode to Sir Lucius Cary\nand Sir H. Morison” (Oxford, No. 194) has been thought to be the first\nstrictly Pindaric ode in English, and Gray’s “Bard” and “Progress of\nPoesy” (Oxford, Nos. 454, 455) are still more familiar examples of this\ntype. But the great popularity of the so-called “Pindaric” ode in English\nin the seventeenth century was due to Cowley, and to one of those periodic\nloyalties to lawlessness which are characteristic of the English. For\nCowley, failing to perceive that Pindar’s apparent lawlessness was\ndue to the corruption of the Greek text and to the modern ignorance of the\nrules of Greek choral music, made his English “Pindaric” odes an outlet\nfor rebellion against all stanzaic law. The finer the poetic frenzy, the\nfreer the lyric pattern! But, alas, rhetoric soon triumphed over\nimagination, and in the absence of metrical restraint the ode grew\ndeclamatory, bombastic, and lowest stage of all, “official,” the last\nrefuge of laureates who felt obliged to produce something sonorous in\nhonor of a royal birthday or wedding. This official ode persisted long\nafter the pseudo-Pindaric flag was lowered and Cowley had become\nneglected.",
        "With the revival of Romantic imagination, however, came a new interest in\nthe “irregular” ode, whose strophic arrangement ebbs and flows without\napparent restraint, subject only to what Watts-Dunton termed “emotional\nlaw.” Wordsworth’s “Ode on the Intimations of Immortality” moves in\nobedience to its own rhythmic impulses only, like Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan\"\nand Emerson’s “Bacchus.” Metrical variety can nowhere be shown more freely\nand gloriously than in the irregular ode: there may be any number of lines\nin each strophe, and often the strophe itself becomes dissolved into\nsomething corresponding to the “movement” of a symphony. Masterpieces like\nWilliam Vaughn Moody’s “Ode in Time of Hesitation” and Francis Thompson’s\n\"Hound of Heaven” reveal of course a firm intellectual grasp upon the\nunderlying theme of the ode and upon the logical processes of its\ndevelopment. But although we may follow with keen intellectual\ndelight these large, free handlings of a lyrical theme, there are few\nreaders of poetry whose susceptibility to complicated combinations of\nrhyme-sound allows them to perceive the full verbal beauty of the great\nirregular odes. Even in such regular strophes as those of Keats’s “Grecian\nUrn,” who remembers that the rhyme scheme of the first stanza is unlike\nthat of the following stanzas? Or that the second stanza of the “Ode to a\nNightingale” runs on four sounds instead of five? Let the reader test his\near by reading aloud the intricate sound-patterns employed in such elegies\nas Arnold’s “Scholar Gypsy” (Oxford, No. 751) or Swinburne’s “Ave atque\nVale” (Oxford, No. 810), and then let him go back to “Lycidas\"\n(Oxford, No. 317), the final test of one’s responsiveness to the\nblending of the intellectual and the sensuous elements in poetic beauty.\nIf he is honest with himself, he will probably confess that neither his\near nor his mind can keep full pace with the swift and subtle demands made\nupon both by the masters of sustained lyric energy. But he will also\nbecome freshly aware that the ode is a supreme example of that union of\nexcitement with a sense of order, of liberty with law, which gives Verse\nits immortality.",
        "7. The Sonnet\nThe sonnet, likewise, is a lyric form which illustrates the delicate\nbalance between freedom and restraint. Let us look first at its structure,\nand then at its capacity for expressing thought and feeling.",
        "Both name and structure are Italian in origin, “sonetto” being the\ndiminutive of “suono,” sound. Dante and Petrarch knew it as a special\nlyric form intended for musical accompaniment. It must have fourteen\nlines, neither more nor less, with five beats or “stresses” to the line.\nEach line must end with a rhyme. In the arrangement of the rhymes the\nsonnet is made up of two parts, or rhyme-systems: the first eight lines\nforming the “octave,” and the last six the “sestet.” The octave is made up\nof two quatrains and the sestet of two tercets. There is a main pause in\npassing from the octave to the sestet, and frequently there are minor\npauses in passing from the first quatrain to the second, and from the\nfirst tercet to the last.",
        "Almost all of Petrarch’s sonnets follow this rhyme-scheme: for the octave,\na b b a a b b a; for the sestet, either c d e c d e or c d c d c d.\nThis strict “Petrarchan” form has endured for six centuries. It has been\nadopted by poets of every race and language, and it is used to-day as\nwidely or more widely than ever. While individual poets have constantly\nexperimented with different rhyme-schemes, particularly in the sestet, the\nonly really notable invention of a new sonnet form was made by the\nElizabethans. Puttenham’s Arte of English Poesie (1589) declares that\n\"Sir Thomas Wyatt the elder and Henry Earl of Surrey, having travelled\ninto Italy and there tasted the sweet and stately measures and style of\nthe Italian poesie,... greatly polished our rude and homely manner of\nvulgar poesie.... Their conceits were lofty, their style stately, their\nconveyance cleanly, their terms proper, their metre sweet and\nwell-proportioned, in all imitating very naturally and studiously their\nMaster Francis Petrarch.”",
        "This is charming, but as a matter of fact both Wyatt and Surrey, with\nnatural English independence, broke away from the strict Petrarchan rhyme\nform. Wyatt liked a final couplet, and Surrey used a rhyme-scheme which\nwas later adopted by Shakspere and is known to-day as the “Shaksperean\"\nform of sonnet: namely, three quatrains made up of alternate rhymes–a\nseparate rhyme-scheme for each quatrain–and a closing couplet. The rhymes\nconsequently run thus: a b a b c d c d e f e f g g. To the Petrarchan\npurist this is clearly no sonnet at all, in spite of its fourteen\nfive-beat, rhyming lines. For the distinction between octave and sestet\nhas disappeared, there is a threefold division of the first twelve lines,\nand the final couplet gives an epigrammatic summary or “point” which\nPetrarch took pains to avoid.",
        "The difference will be still more clearly manifest if we turn from a\ncomparison of rhyme-structure to the ordering of the thought in the\nPetrarchan sonnet. Mark Pattison, a stout “Petrarchan,” lays down these\nrules in the Preface to his edition of Milton’s Sonnets:\n[Footnote: D. Appleton & Co., New York, 1883.]",
        "  “a. A sonnet, like every other work of art, must have its unity. It must\n  be the expression of one, and only one, thought or feeling.",
        "  “b. This thought or mood should be led up to, and opened in the early\n  lines of the sonnet; strictly, in the first quatrain; in the second\n  quatrain the hearer should be placed in full possession of it.",
        "  “c. After the second quatrain there should be a pause, not full, nor\n  producing the effect of a break, as of one who had finished what he had\n  got to say, and not preparing a transition to a new subject, but as of\n  one who is turning over what has been said in the mind to enforce it\n  further.",
        "  “d. The opening of the second system, strictly the first tercet, should\n  turn back upon the thought or sentiment, take it up and carry it forward\n  to the conclusion.",
        "  “e. The conclusion should be a resultant, summing the total of the\n  suggestion in the preceding lines, as a lakelet in the hills gathers\n  into a still pool the running waters contributed by its narrow area of\n  gradients.",
        "  “f. While the conclusion should leave a sense of finish and\n  completeness, it is necessary to avoid anything like epigrammatic point.\n  By this the sonnet is distinguished from the epigram. In the epigram the\n  conclusion is everything; all that goes before it is only there for the\n  sake of the surprise of the end, or dénouement, as in a logical\n  syllogism the premisses are nothing but as they necessitate the\n  conclusion. In the sonnet the emphasis is nearly, but not quite, equally\n  distributed, there being a slight swell, or rise, about its middle. The\n  sonnet must not advance by progressive climax, or end abruptly; it\n  should subside, and leave off quietly.”",
        "Miss Lockwood, in the Introduction to her admirable collection of English\nsonnets,\n[Footnote: Sonnets, English and American, selected by Laura E. Lockwood.\nHoughton Mifflin Company, 1916.]\nmakes a still briefer summary of the thought-scheme of the regular Italian\nsonnet: it “should have a clear and unified theme, stated in the first\nquatrain, developed or proved in the second, confirmed or regarded from a\nnew point of view in the first tercet, and concluded in the second tercet.\nIt had thus four parts, divided unevenly into two separate systems, eight\nlines being devoted to placing the thought before the mind, and six to\ndeducing the conclusion from that thought.”",
        "A surprisingly large number of sonnets are built upon simple formulas like\n\"As\"–for the octave–and “So\"–for the sestet–(see Andrew Lang’s “The\nOdyssey,” Oxford, No. 841); or “When” and “Then” (see Keats’s “When I\nhave fears that I may cease to be,” Oxford, No. 635). A situation plus a\nthought gives a mood; or a mood plus an event gives a mental resolve, etc.\nThe possible combinations are infinite, but the law of logical relation\nbetween octave and sestet, premise and conclusion, is immutable.",
        "Let the reader now test these laws of sonnet form and thought by reading\naloud one of the most familiarly known of all English sonnets–Keats’s “On\nFirst Looking into Chapman’s Homer”:",
        "  “Much have I travell’d in the realms of gold,\n  And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;\n  Round many western islands have I been\n  Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.\n  Oft of one wide expanse had I been told\n  That deep-brow’d Homer ruled as his demesne;\n  Yet did I never breathe its pure serene\n  Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:\n  Then felt I like some watcher of the skies\n  When a new planet swims into his ken;\n  Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes\n  He stared at the Pacific–and all his men\n  Look’d at each other with a wild surmise–\n  Silent, upon a peak in Darien.”",
        "Read next another strictly Petrarchan sonnet, where the thought divisions\nof quatrains and tercets are marked with exceptional clearness, Eugene\nLee-Hamilton’s disillusioned “Sea-Shell Murmurs”:",
        "  “The hollow sea-shell that for years hath stood\n    On dusty shelves, when held against the ear\n    Proclaims its stormy parent; and we hear\n  The faint far murmur of the breaking flood.",
        "  “We hear the sea. The sea? It is the blood\n    In our own veins, impetuous and near,\n    And pulses keeping pace with hope and fear\n  And with our feelings’ every shifting mood.",
        "  “Lo, in my heart I hear, as in a shell,\n    The murmur of a world beyond the grave,\n  Distinct, distinct, though faint and far it be.",
        "  “Thou fool; this echo is a cheat as well,–\n    The hum of earthly instincts; and we crave\n  A world unreal as the shell-heard sea.”",
        "And now read aloud one of the best-known of Shakspere’s sonnets, where he\nfollows his favorite device of a threefold statement of his central\nthought, using a different image in each quatrain, and closing with a\npersonal application of the idea:",
        "  “That time of year thou mayst in me behold\n  When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang\n  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,\n  Bare ruin’d choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.\n  In me thou see’st the twilight of such day\n  As after sunset fadeth in the west;\n  Which by and by black night doth take away,\n  Death’s second self, that seals up all in rest.\n  In me thou see’st the glowing of such fire,\n  That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,\n  As the death-bed whereon it must expire,\n  Consumed with that which it was nourish’d by.\n  This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,\n  To love that well which thou must leave ere long.”",
        "Where there is beauty such as this, it is an impertinence to insist that\nShakspere has not conformed to the special type of beauty represented in\nthe Petrarchan sonnet. He chose not to conform. He won with other tactics.\nIf the reader will analyse the form and thought of the eighty sonnets in\nthe Oxford Book, or the two hundred collected by Miss Lockwood, he will\nfeel the charm of occasional irregularity in the handling of both the\nPetrarchan and the Shaksperean sonnet. But he is more likely, I think, to\nbecome increasingly aware that whatever restraints are involved in\nadherence to typical forms are fully compensated by the rich verbal beauty\ndemanded by the traditional arrangement of rhymes.",
        "For the sonnet, an intricately wrought model of the reflective lyric,\nrequires a peculiarly intimate union of thinking and singing. It may be,\nas it often was in the Elizabethan period, too full of thought to allow\nfree-winged song, and it may also be too full of uncontrolled, unbalanced\nemotion to preserve fit unity of thought. Conversely, there may not be\nenough thought and emotion to fill the fourteen lines: the idea not being\nof “sonnet size.” The difficult question as to whether there is such a\nthing as an “average-sized” thought and lyrical reflection upon it has\nbeen touched upon in an earlier chapter. The limit of a sentence, says\nMark Pattison, “is given by the average capacity of human apprehension....\nThe limit of a sonnet is imposed by the average duration of an\nemotional mood....  May we go so far as to say that fourteen lines is the\naverage number which a thought requires for its adequate embodiment before\nattention must collapse?”",
        "The proper distribution of thought and emotion, that is, the balance of\nthe different parts of a sonnet, is also a very delicate affair. It is\nlike trimming a sailboat. Wordsworth defended Milton’s frequent practice\nof letting the thought of the octave overflow somewhat into the sestet,\nbelieving it “to aid in giving that pervading sense of intense unity in\nwhich the excellence of the sonnet has always seemed to me mainly to\nconsist.” Most lovers of the sonnet would differ here with these masters\nof the art. Whether the weight of thought and feeling can properly be\nshifted to a final couplet is another debatable question, and critics will\nalways differ as to the artistic value of the “big” line or “big” word\nwhich marks the culmination of emotion in many a sonnet. The strange or\nviolent or sonorous word, however splendid in itself, may not fit the\ncurve of the sonnet in which it appears: it may be like a big red apple\ncrowded into the toe of a Christmas stocking.",
        "Nor must the sonnet lean towards either obscurity–the vice of Elizabethan\nsonnets, or obviousness–the vice of Wordsworth’s sonnets after 1820. The\nobscure sonnet, while it may tempt the reader’s intellectual ingenuity,\naffords no basis for his emotion, and the obvious sonnet provides no\nstimulus for his thought. Conventionality of subject and treatment,\nlike the endless imitation of Italian and French sonnet-motives and\nsonnet-sequences, sins against the law of lyric sincerity. In no lyric\nform does mechanism so easily obtrude itself. A sonnet is either, like\nMarlowe’s raptures, “all air and fire,” or else it is a wooden toy.",
        "RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
        "  “Unless there is a concurrence between the contemporary idioms and\n  rhythms of a period, with the individual idiom of the lyrist, half\n  the expressional force of his ideas will be lost.\"\n    ERNEST RHYS, Foreword to Lyric Poetry",
        "We have been considering the typical qualities and forms of lyric poetry.\nLet us now attempt a rapid survey of some of the conditions which have\ngiven the lyric, in certain races and periods and in the hands of certain\nindividuals, its peculiar power.",
        "1. Questions that are involved\nA whole generation of so-called “scientific” criticism has come and gone\nsince Taine’s brilliant experiments with his formula of “race, period and\nenvironment” as applied to literature. Taine’s English Literatureremains a monument to the suggestiveness and to the dangers of his method.\nSome of his countrymen, notably Brunetière in the Evolution de la Poésie\nLyrique en France au XIX Siècle, and Legouis in the Défense de la Poésie\nFrançaise, have discussed more cautiously and delicately than Taine\nhimself the racial and historic conditions affecting lyric poetry in\nvarious periods.",
        "The tendency at present, among critics of poetry, is to distrust formulas\nand to keep closely to ascertainable facts, and this tendency is surely\nmore scientific than the most captivating theorizing. For one thing, while\nrecognizing, as the World War has freshly compelled us to recognize, the\nactuality of racial differences, we have grown sceptical of the old\nendeavors to classify races in simple terms, as Madame de Staël attempted\nto do, for instance, in her famous book on Germany. We endeavor to\ndistinguish, more accurately than of old, between ethnic, linguistic and\npolitical divisions of men. We try to look behind the name at the thing\nitself: we remember that “Spanish” architecture is Arabian, and a good\ndeal of “Gothic” is Northern French. We confess that we are only at the\nbeginning of a true science of ethnology. “It is only in their degree of\nphysical and mental evolution that the races of men are different,\"\nsays Professor W. Z. Ripley, author of Races in Europe. The late\nProfessor Josiah Royce admitted: “I am baffled to discover just what the\nresults of science are regarding the true psychological and moral meaning\nof race differences.... All men in prehistoric times are surprisingly\nalike in their minds, their morals and their arts....  We do not\nscientifically know what the true racial varieties of mental type really\nare.\"\n[Footnote: See Royce’s Race-Questions. New York, 1908.]",
        "I have often thought of these utterances of my colleagues, as I have\nattempted to teach something about lyric poetry in Harvard classrooms\nwhere Chinese, Japanese, Jewish, Irish, French, German, Negro, Russian,\nItalian and Armenian students appear in bewildering and stimulating\nconfusion. Precisely what is their racial reaction to a lyric of Sappho?\nTo an Anglo-Saxon war-song of the tenth century? To a Scotch ballad? To\none of Shakspere’s songs? Some specific racial reaction there must be,\none imagines, but such capacity for self-expression as the student\ncommands is rarely capable of giving more than a hint of it.",
        "And what real response is there, among the majority of contemporary\nlovers of poetry, to the delicate shades of feeling which color the\nverse of specific periods in the various national literatures? We all use\ncatch-words, and I shall use them myself later in this chapter, in the\nattempt to indicate the changes in lyric atmosphere as we pass, for\ninstance, from the Elizabethan to the Jacobean age, or from the “Augustan\"\nto the Romantic epoch in English literature. Is this sensitiveness to the\ntemper of various historic periods merely the possession of a few hundred\nprofessional scholars, who have trained themselves, like Walter Pater, to\nlive in some well-chosen moment of the past and to find in their\nhyper-sensitized responsiveness to its voices a sort of consolation prize\nfor their isolation from the present? Race-mindedness is common, no doubt,\nbut difficult to express in words: historic-mindedness, though more\ncapable of expression, is necessarily confined to a few. Is the response\nto the poetry of past epochs, then, chiefly a response of the individual\nreader to an individual poet, and do we cross the frontiers of race and\nlanguage and historic periods with the main purpose of finding a man after\nour own heart? Or is the secret of our pleasure in the poetry of alien\nraces and far-off times simply this: that nothing human is really alien,\nand that poetry through its generalizing, universalizing power, reveals to\nus the essential oneness of mankind?",
        "2. Graphic Arts and the Lyric\nA specific illustration may suggest an answer. An American collector of\nJapanese prints recognizes in these specimens of Oriental craftsmanship\nthat mastery of line and composition which are a part of the universal\nlanguage of the graphic arts. Any human being, in fact, who has developed\na sensitiveness to artistic beauty will receive a measure of delight from\nthe work of Japanese masters. A few strokes of the brush upon silk, a bit\nof lacquer work, the decoration of a sword-hilt, are enough to set his eye\ndancing. But the expert collector soon passes beyond this general\nenthusiasm into a quite particular interest in the handicraft of special\nartists,–a Motonobu, let us say, or a Sesshiu. The collector finds his\npleasure in their individual handling of artistic problems, their unique\nfaculties of eye and hand. He responds, in a word, both to the\ncosmopolitan language employed by every practitioner of the fine arts, and\nto the local idiom, the personal accent, of, let us say, a certain\nJapanese draughtsman of the eighteenth century.",
        "And now take, by way of confirmation and also of contrast, the attitude of\nan American lover of poetry toward those specimens of Japanese and Chinese\nlyrics which have recently been presented to us in English translations.\nThe American’s ignorance of the riental languages cuts him off from any\nappreciation of the individual handling of diction and metre. A Lafcadio\nHearn may write delightfully about that special seventeen syllable form of\nJapanese verse known as the hokku. Here is a hokku by Basho, one of\nthe most skilled composers in that form. Hearn prints it with the\ntranslation,\n[Footnote: Kwaidan, p. 188. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1904.]\nand explains that the verses are intended to suggest the joyous feeling of\nspring-time:",
        "    “Oki, oki yo!\n  Waga tomo ni sen\n    Néru–kocho!”",
        "(Wake up! Wake up!–I will make thee my comrade, thou sleeping butterfly.)\nAn Occidental reader may recognize, through the translation, the charm of\nthe poetic image, and he may be interested in a technical lyric form\nhitherto new to him, but beyond this, in his ignorance of Japanese, he\ncannot go. Here is a lyric by Wang Ch’ang-Ling, a Chinese poet of the\neighth century:",
        " Tears in the Spring[Footnote: These Chinese lyrics are quoted from The Lute of Jade,\nLondon, 1909. The translations are by L. Cranmer-Byng.]",
        "  “Clad in blue silk and bright embroidery\n  At the first call of Spring the fair young bride,\n  On whom as yet Sorrow has laid no scar,\n  Climbs the Kingfisher’s Tower. Suddenly\n  She sees the bloom of willows far and wide,\n  And grieves for him she lent to fame and war.”",
        "And here is another spring lyric by Po Chü-I (A.D. 772-846), as clear and\nsimple as anything in the Greek Anthology:",
        " The Grass[Footnote: These Chinese lyrics are quoted from The Lute of Jade,\nLondon, 1909. The translations are by L. Cranmer-Byng.]",
        "  “How beautiful and fresh the grass returns!\n  When golden days decline, the meadow burns;\n  Yet autumn suns no hidden root have slain,\n  The spring winds blow, and there is grass again.",
        "  “Green rioting on olden ways it falls:\n  The blue sky storms the ruined city walls;\n  Yet since Wang Sun departed long ago,\n  When the grass blooms both joy and fear I know.”",
        "The Western reader, although wholly at the mercy of the translator,\nrecognizes the pathos and beauty of the scene and thought expressed by the\nChinese poet. But all that is specifically Chinese in lyric form is lost\nto him.",
        "I have purposely chosen these Oriental types of lyric because they\nrepresent so clearly the difference between the universal language of the\ngraphic arts and the more specialized language of poetry. The latter is\nstill able to convey, even through translation, a suggestion of the\nemotions common to all men; and this is true of the verse which lies\nwholly outside the line of that Hebrew-Greek-Roman tradition which has\naffected so profoundly the development of modern European literature. Yet\nto express ’ce que tout le monde pense“–which was Boileau’s version of\nHorace’s ’propria communia dicere“–is only part of the function of\nlyric poetry. To give the body of the time the form and pressure of\nindividual feeling, of individual artistic mastery of the language of\none’s race and epoch;–this, no less than the other, is the task and the\nopportunity of the lyric poet.",
        "3. Decay and Survival\nTo appreciate the triumph of whatever lyrics have survived, even when\nsheltered by the protection of common racial or cultural traditions, one\nmust remember that the overwhelming majority of lyrics, like the majority\nof artistic products of all ages and races and stages of civilization, are\nirretrievably lost. Weak-winged is song! A book like Gummere’s Beginnings\nof Poetry, glancing as it does at the origins of so many national\nliteratures and at the rudimentary poetic efforts of various races that\nhave never emerged from barbarism, gives one a poignant sense of the\nprodigality of the song-impulse compared with the slenderness of the\nactual survivals. Autumn leaves are not more fugitive. Even when preserved\nby sacred ritual, like the Vedas and the Hebrew Psalter, what we possess\nis only an infinitesimal fraction of what has perished. The Sibyl tears\nleaf after leaf from her precious volume and scatters them to the winds.\nHow many glorious Hebrew war-songs of the type presented in the “Song of\nDeborah” were chanted only to be forgotten! We have but a handful of the\nlyrics of Sappho and of the odes of Pindar, while the fragments of lyric\nverse gathered up in the Greek Anthology tantalize us with their\nreminder of what has been lost beyond recall.",
        "Yet if we keep to the line of Hebrew-Greek-Roman tradition, we are equally\nimpressed with the enduring influence of the few lyrics that have\nsurvived. The Hebrew lyric, in its diction, its rhythmical patterns, and\nabove all in its flaming intensity of spirit, bears the marks of racial\npurity, of mental vigor and moral elevation. It became something even more\nsignificant, however, than the spiritual expression of a chosen race. The\nEast met the West when these ancient songs of the Hebrew Psalter were\nadopted and sung by the Christian Church. They were translated, in the\nfourth century, into the Latin of the Vulgate. Many an Anglo-Saxon gleeman\nknew that Latin version. It moulded century after century the liturgy of\nthe European world. It influenced Tyndale’s English version of the Psalms,\nand this has in turn affected the whole vocabulary and style of the modern\nEnglish lyric. There is scarcely a page of the Oxford Book of English\nVerse which does not betray in word or phrase the influence of the\nHebrew Psalter.",
        "Or take that other marvelous example of the expression of emotion in terms\nof bodily sensation, the lyric of the Greeks. Its clarity and unity, its\ndislike of vagueness and excess, its finely artistic restraint, are\ncharacteristic of the race. The simpler Greek lyrical measures were taken\nover by Catullus, Horace and Ovid, and though there were subtle qualities\nof the Greek models which escaped the Roman imitators, the Greco-Roman or\n\"classic” restraint of over-turbulent emotions became a European heritage.\nIt is doubtless true, as Dr. Henry Osborn Taylor has pointed out,\n[Footnote: See his Classical Heritage of the Middle Ages, chap. 9, and\nparticularly the passage quoted in the “Notes and Illustrations” to chap.\nv of this volume.]\nthat the Greek and Roman classical metres became in time inadequate to\nexpress the new Christian spirit “which knew neither clarity nor measure.\"\n\"The antique sense of form and proportion, the antique observance of the\nmean and avoidance of extravagance and excess, the antique dislike for the\nunlimited or the monstrous, the antique feeling for literary unity, and\nabstention from irrelevancy, the frank love for all that is beautiful or\ncharming, for the beauty of the body and for everything connected with the\njoy of mortal life, the antique reticence as to hopes or fears of what was\nbeyond the grave,–these qualities cease in medieval Latin poetry.”",
        "4. Lyrics of Western Europe\nThe racial characteristics of the peoples of Western Europe began to show\nthemselves even in their Latin poetry, but it is naturally in the rise of\nthe vernacular literatures, during the Middle Ages, that we trace the\nsigns of thnic differentiation. Teuton and Frank and Norseman, Spaniard or\nItalian, betray their blood as soon as they begin to sing in their own\ntongue. The scanty remains of Anglo-Saxon lyrical verse are colored with\nthe love of battle and of the sea, with the desolateness of lonely wolds,\nwith the passion of loyalty to a leader. Read “Deor’s Lament,” “Widsith,\"\n\"The Wanderer,” “The Sea-farer,” or the battle-songs of Brunanburh and\nMaldon in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.\n[Footnote: See Cook and Tinker, Select Translations from Old English\nPoetry (Boston, 1902), and Pancoast and Spaeth, Early English Poems(New York, 1911).]\nThe last strophe of “Deor’s Lament,” our oldest English lyric, ends with\nthe line:",
        " “Thaes ofereode, thisses swa maeg” “That he surmounted, so this may I!”\nThe wandering Ulysses says something like this, it is true, in a line of\nthe Odyssey, but to feel its English racial quality one has only to read\nafter it Masefield’s “To-morrow”:",
        "  “Oh yesterday our little troop was ridden through and through,\n  Our swaying, tattered pennons fled, a broken beaten few,\n  And all a summer afternoon they hunted us and slew;\n                   But to-morrow,\n  By the living God, we ’II try the game again!”",
        "When Taillefer, knight and minstrel, rode in front of the Norman line at\nthe battle of Hastings, “singing of Charlemagne and of Roland and of\nOliver and the vassals who fell at Roncevaux,” he typified the coming\ntriumphs of French song in England.\n[Footnote: See E. B. Reed, English Lyrical Poetry, chap. 2. 1912.]\nFrench lyrical fashions would have won their way, no doubt, had there been\nno battle of Hastings. The banners of William the Conqueror had been\nblessed by Rome. They represented Europe, and the inevitable flooding of\nthe island outpost of “Germania” by the tide of European civilization.\nChanson and carole, dance-songs, troubadour lyrics, the ballade,\nrondel and Noël, amorous songs of French courtiers, pious hymns of\nFrench monks, began to sing themselves in England. The new grace and\ndelicacy is upon every page of Chaucer. What was first Provençal and then\nFrench, became English when Chaucer touched it. From the shadow and\ngrimness and elegiac pathos of Old English poetry we come suddenly into\nthe light and color and gayety of Southern France.\n[Footnote: See the passage from Legouis quoted in the “Notes and\nIllustrations” for this chapter.]\nIn place of Caedmon’s terrible picture of Hell–\"ever fire or frost\"–or\nDunbar’s “Lament for the Makers” (Oxford, No. 21) with its refrain:",
        "  ’Timor Mortis conturbat me,“",
        "or the haunting burden of the “Lyke-Wake Dirge” (Oxford, No. 381),",
        "  “This ae nighte, this ae nighte,\n    –Every nighte and alle,\n  Fire and sleet and candle-lighte,\n    And Christe receive thy saule,”",
        "we now find English poets echoing Aucassin and Nicolette:",
        "  “In Paradise what have I to win? Therein I seek not to enter, but only\n  to have Nicolette, my sweet lady that I love so well. For into Paradise\n  go none but such folk as I shall tell thee now: Thither go these same\n  old priests, and halt old men and maimed, who all day and night cower\n  continually before the altars and in the crypts; and such folk as wear\n  old amices and old clouted frocks, and naked folk and shoeless, and\n  covered with sores, perishing of hunger and thirst and of cold, and of\n  little ease. These be they that go into Paradise; with them I have\n  naught to make. But into Hell would I fain go; for into Hell fare the\n  goodly clerks, and goodly knights that fall in tourneys and great wars,\n  and stout men at arms, and all men noble. With these would I liefly go.\n  And thither pass the sweet ladies and courteous that have two lovers or\n  three, and their lords also thereto. Thither goes the gold and the\n  silver, the cloth of vair and cloth of gris, and harpers and makers, and\n  the prince of this world. With these I would gladly go, let me but have\n  with me Nicolette, my sweetest lady.”",
        "5. The Elizabethan Lyric\nThe European influence came afresh to England, as we have seen, with those\n\"courtly makers” who travelled into France and Italy and brought back the\nnew-found treasures of the Renaissance. Greece and Rome renewed, as they\nare forever from time to time renewing, their hold upon the imagination\nand the art of English verse. Sometimes this influence of the classics has\nworked toward contraction, restraint, acceptance of human limitations and\nof the “rules” of art. But in Elizabethan poetry the classical influence\nwas on the side of expansion. In that release of vital energy which\ncharacterized the English Renaissance, the rediscovery of Greece and Rome\nand the artistic contacts with France and Italy heightened the confidence\nof Englishmen, revealed the continuity of history and gave new faith in\nhuman nature. It spelled, for the moment at least, liberty rather than\nauthority. It stimulated intellectual curiosity and enthusiasm. Literary\ncriticism awoke to life in the trenchant discussions of the art of poetry\nby Gascoigne and Sidney, by Puttenham, Campion and Daniel. The very titles\nof the collections of lyrics which followed the famous Tottel’s\nMiscellany of 1557 flash with the spirit of the epoch: A Paradise of\nDainty Devices, A Gorgeous Gallery of Gallant Inventions, A Handfull\nof Pleasant Delights, The Phoenix Nest, England’s Helicon, Davison’s\nPoetical Rhapsody.\nBullen, Schelling, Rhys, Braithwaite, and other modern collectors of the\nElizabethan lyric have ravaged these volumes and many more, and have shown\nhow the imported Italian pastoral tallied with the English idyllic mood,\nhow the study of prosody yielded rich and various stanzaic effects, how\nthe diffusion of the passion for song through all classes of the community\ngave a marvelous singing quality to otherwise thin and mere “dildido\"\nlines. Mr. Arnold Dolmetsch and his friends have revived the music of the\nElizabethan song-books, and John Erskine and other scholars have\ninvestigated the relation of the song-books–especially the songs composed\nby musicians such as Byrd, Dowland and Campion–to the form and quality of\nthe surviving lyric verse. But one does not need a knowledge of the\nElizabethan lute and viol, and of the precise difference between a\n\"madrigal” and a “catch” or “air” in order to perceive the tunefulness\nof a typical Elizabethan song:",
        " “I care not for these ladies,\n  That must be woode and praide:\n  Give me kind Amarillis,\n  The wanton countrey maide.\n  Nature art disdaineth,\n  Here beautie is her owne.\n    Her when we court and kisse,\n    She cries, Forsooth, let go:\n    But when we come where comfort is,\n    She never will say No.”",
        "It is not that the spirit of Elizabethan lyric verse is always care-free,\neven when written by prodigals such as Peele and Greene and Marlowe. Its\nchildlike grasping after sensuous pleasure is often shadowed by the sword,\nand by quick-coming thoughts of the brevity of mortal things. Yet it is\nalways spontaneous, swift, alive. Its individual voices caught the tempo\nand cadence of the race and epoch, so that men as unlike personally as\nSpenser, Marlowe and Donne are each truly “Elizabethan.” Spenser’s\n\"vine-like” luxuriance, Marlowe’s soaring energy, Donne’s grave realistic\nsubtleties, illustrate indeed that note of individualism which is never\nlacking in the great poetic periods. This individualism betrays itself in\nalmost every song of Shakspere’s plays. For here is English race, surely,\nand the very echo and temper of the Renaissance, but with it all there is\nthe indescribable, inimitable timbre of one man’s singing voice.",
        "6. The Reaction\nIf we turn, however, from the lyrics of Shakspere to those of Ben Jonson\nand of the “sons of Ben” who sang in the reigns of James I and Charles I,\nwe become increasingly conscious of a change in atmosphere. The moment of\nexpansion has passed. The “first fine careless rapture” is over. Classical\n\"authority” resumes its silent, steady pressure. Scholars like to remember\nthat the opening lines of Ben Jonson’s “Drink to me only with thine eyes\"\nare a transcript from the Greek. In his “Ode to Himself upon the Censure\nof his New Inn” in 1620 Jonson, like Landor long afterward, takes\nscornful refuge from the present in turning back to Greece and Rome:",
        "  “Leave things so prostitute,\n     And take the Alcaic lute;\n   Or thine own Horace, or Anacreon’s lyre;\n     Warm thee by Pindar’s fire.”",
        "The reaction in lyric form showed itself in the decay of sonnet, pastoral\nand madrigal, in the neglect of blank verse, in the development of the\ncouplet. Milton, in such matters as these, was a solitary survival of the\nElizabethans. Metrical experimentation almost ceased, except in the hands\nof ingenious recluses like George Herbert. The popular metre of the\nCaroline poets was the rhymed eight and six syllable quatrain:",
        "  “Yet this inconstancy is such\n     As thou too shalt adore;\n   I could not love thee, Dear, so much\n     Loved I not Honour more.”",
        "The mystics like Crashaw, Vaughan and Traherne wished and secured a wider\nmetrical liberty, and it is, in truth, these complicated patterns of the\ndevotional lyric of the seventeenth century that are of greatest interest\nto the poets of our own day. But contemporary taste, throughout the\ngreater portion of that swiftly changing epoch, preferred verse that\nshowed a conservative balance in thought and feeling, in diction and\nversification. Waller, with his courtier-like instinct for what was\nacceptable, took the middle of the road, letting Cowley and Quarles\nexperiment as fantastically as they pleased. Andrew Marvell, too, a\nPuritan writing in the Restoration epoch, composed as “smoothly\"\nas Waller. Herrick, likewise, though fond of minor metrical experiments,\ncelebrated his quiet garden pleasures and his dalliance with amorous\nfancies in verse of the true Horatian type. “Intensive rather than\nexpansive, fanciful rather than imaginative, and increasingly restrictive\nin its range and appeal”: that is Professor Schelling’s expert summary of\nthe poetic tendencies of the age.",
        "And then the lyric impulse died away in England. Dryden could be\nmagnificently sonorous in declamation and satire, but he lacked the\nsinging voice. Pope likewise, though he “lisped in numbers,” could never,\nfor all of his cleverness, learn to sing. The age of the Augustans, in the\nfirst quarter of the eighteenth century, was an age of prose, of reason,\nof good sense, of “correctness.” The decasyllabic couplet, so resonant in\nDryden, so admirably turned and polished by Pope, was its favorite\nmeasure. The poets played safe. They took no chances with “enthusiasm,\"\neither in mood or metrical device. What could be said within the\nrestraining limits of the couplet they said with admirable point, vigor\nand grace. But it was speech, not song.",
        "7. The Romantic Lyric\nThe revolt came towards the middle of the century, first in the lyrics of\nCollins, then in Gray. The lark began to soar and sing once more in\nEnglish skies. New windows were opened in the House of Life. Men looked\nout again with curiosity, wonder and a sense of strangeness in the\npresence of beauty. They saw Nature with new eyes; found a new richness in\nthe Past, a new picturesque and savor in the life of other races,\nparticularly in the wild Northern and Celtic strains of blood. Life grew\nagain something mysterious, not to be comprehended by the “good sense” of\nthe Augustans, or expressible in the terms of the rhymed couplet. Instead\nof the normal, poets sought the exceptional, then the strange, the\nfar-away in time or place, or else the familiar set in some unusual\nfantastic light. The mood of poetry changed from tranquil sentiment to\nexcited sentiment or “sensibility,” and then to sheer passion. The forms\nof poetry shifted from the conventional to the revival of old measures\nlike blank verse and the Spenserian stanza, then to the invention of new\nand freer forms, growing ever more lyrical. Poetic diction rebelled\nagainst the Augustan conventions, the stereotyped epithets, the frigid\npersonifications. It abandoned the abstract and general for the specific\nand the picturesque. It turned to the language of real life, and then,\ndissatisfied, to the heightened language of passion. If one reads Cowper,\nBlake, Burns and Wordsworth, to say nothing of poets like Byron and\nShelley who wrote in the full Romantic tide of feeling, one finds that\nthis poetry has discovered new themes. It portrays the child, the peasant,\nthe villager, the outcast, the slave, the solitary person, even the idiot\nand the lunatic. There is a new human feeling for the individual, and for\nthe endless, the poignant variety of “states of soul.” Browning, by and\nby, is to declare that “states of soul” are the only things worth a poet’s\nattention.",
        "Now this new individuality of themes, of language, of moods, assisted in\nthe free expression of lyricism, the release of the song-impulse of the\n\"single, separate person.” The Romantic movement was revelatory, in a\ndouble sense. “Creation widened in man’s view\"; and there was equally a\nrevelation of individual poetic energy which gave the Romantic lyric an\nextraordinary variety and beauty of form. There was an exaggerated\nindividualism, no doubt, which marked the weak side of the whole movement:\na deliberate extravagance, a cultivated egoism. Vagueness has its\nlegitimate poetic charm, but in England no less than in Germany or France\nlyric vagueness often became incoherence. Symbolism degenerated into\nmeaninglessness. But the fantastic and grotesque side of Romantic\nindividualism should not blind us to the central fact that a rich\npersonality may appear in a queer garb. Victor Hugo, like his young\nfriends of the 1830’s, loved to make the gray-coated citizens of Paris\nstare at his scarlet, but the personality which could create such lyric\nmarvels as the Odes et Ballades may be forgiven for its eccentricities.\nWilliam Blake was eccentric to the verge of insanity, yet he opened, like\nWhitman and Poe, new doors of ivory into the wonder-world.",
        "Yet a lyrist like Keats, it must be remembered, betrayed his personality\nnot so much through any external peculiarity of the Romantic temperament\nas through the actual texture of his word and phrase and rhythm. Examine\nhis brush-work microscopically, as experts in Italian painting examine the\nbrushstrokes and pigments of some picture attributed to this or that\nmaster: you will see that Keats, like all the supreme masters of poetic\ndiction, enciphered his lyric message in a language peculiarly his own. It\nis for us to decipher it as we may. He used, of course, particularly in\nhis earlier work, some of the stock-epithets, the stock poetic\n\"properties” of the Romantic school, just as the young Tennyson, in his\nvolume of 1827, played with the “owl” and the “midnight” and the “solitary\nmere,” stock properties of eighteenth-century romance. Yet Tennyson, like\nKeats, and for that matter like Shakspere, passed through this imitative\nphase into an artistic maturity where without violence or extravagance or\neccentricity he compelled words to do his bidding. Each word bears the\nfinger-print of a personality.",
        "Now it is precisely this revelation of personality which gave zest,\nthroughout the Romantic period, to the curiosity about the poetry of alien\nraces. It will be remembered that Romanticism followed immediately upon a\nperiod of cosmopolitanism, and that it preceded that era of intense\nnationalism which came after the Napoleonic wars. Even in that\nintellectual “United States of Europe,” about 1750–when nationalistic\ndifferences were minimized, “enlightenment” was supreme and “propria\ncommunia dicere” was the literary motto–there was nevertheless a rapidly\ngrowing curiosity about races and literatures outside the charmed circle\nof Western Europe. It was the era of the Oriental tale, of Northern\nmythology. Then the poets of England, France and Germany began their\nfruitful interchange of inspiration. Walter Scott turned poet when he\ntranslated Burger’s “Lenore.” Goethe read Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus.\nWordsworth and Coleridge visited Germany not in search of general\neighteenth-century “enlightenment,” but rather in quest of some peculiar\nrevelation of truth and beauty. In the full tide of Romanticism,\nProtestant Germany sought inspiration in Italy and Spain, as Catholic\nFrance sought it in Germany and England. A new sense of race-values\nwas evident in poetry. It may be seen in Southey, Moore, and Byron, in\nHugo’s Les Orientales and in Leconte de Lisle’s Poèmes Barbares.\nModern music has shown the same tendency: Strauss of Vienna writes waltzes\nin Arab rhythms, Grieg composes a Scotch symphony, Dvorák writes an\nAmerican national anthem utilizing negro melodies. As communication\nbetween races has grown easier, and the interest in race-characteristics\nmore intense, it would be strange indeed if lovers of lyric poetry did not\nrange far afield in their search for new complexities of lyric feeling.",
        "8. The Explorer’s Pleasure\nThis explorer’s pleasure in discovering the lyrics of other races was\nnever more keen than it is to-day. Every additional language that one\nlearns, every new sojourn in a foreign country, enriches one’s own\ncapacity for sharing the lyric mood. It is impossible, of course, that any\nrace or period should enter fully into the lyric impulses of another.\nEducated Englishmen have known their Horace for centuries, but it can be\nonly a half-knowledge, delightful as it is. France and England, so near in\nmiles, are still so far away in instinctive comprehension of each other’s\nmode of poetical utterance! No two nations have minds of quite the same\n\"fringe.” No man, however complete a linguist, has more than one real\nmother tongue, and it is only in one’s mother tongue that a lyric\nsings with all its over-tones. And nevertheless, life offers few purer\npleasures than may be found in listening to the half-comprehended songs\nuttered by alien lips indeed, but from hearts that we know are like our\nown.",
        "  “This moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone,\n  It seems to me there are other men in other lands\n     yearning and thoughtful,\n  It seems to me I can look over and behold them in\n     Germany, Italy, France, Spain,\n  Or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or Japan,\n     talking other dialects,\n  And it seems to me if I could know those men I\n     should become attached to them as I do to\n     men in my own lands,\n  O I know we should be brethren and lovers,\n  I know I should be happy with them.”",
        "9. A Test\nIf the reader is willing to test his own responsiveness, not to the alien\nvoices, but to singers of his own blood in other epochs, let him now read\naloud–or better, recite from memory–three of the best-known English\npoems: Milton’s “Lycidas,” Gray’s “Elegy” and Wordsworth’s “Ode to\nImmortality.” The first was published in 1638, the second in 1751, and the\nthird in 1817. Each is a “central” utterance of a race, a period and an\nindividual. Each is an open-air poem, written by a young Englishman; each\nis lyrical, elegiac–a song of mourning and of consolation. “Lycidas” is\nthe last flawless music of the English Renaissance, an epitome of\nclassical and pastoral convention, yet at once Christian, political and\npersonal. Beneath the quiet perfection of Gray’s “Elegy” there is the\nundertone of passionate sympathy for obscure lives: passionate, but\nrestrained. Wordsworth knows no restraint of form or feeling in\nhis great “Ode\"; its germinal idea is absurd to logic, but not to the\nimagination. This elegy, like the others, is a “lyric cry” of a man, an\nage, and a race; “enciphered” like them, with all the cunning of which the\nartist was capable; and decipherable only to those who know the language\nof the English lyric.",
        "There may be readers who find these immortal elegies wearisome, staled by\nrepetition, spoiled by the critical glosses of generations of\ncommentators. In that case, one may test his sense of race, period\nand personality by a single quatrain of Landor, who is surely not\nover-commented upon to-day:",
        "  “From you, Ianthe, little troubles pass\n  Like little ripples down a sunny river;\n  Your pleasures spring like daisies in the grass,\n  Cut down, and up again as blithe as ever.”",
        "Find the classicist, the aristocrat, the Englishman, and the lover in that\nquatrain!",
        "Or, if Landor seems too remote, turn to Amherst, Massachusetts, and read\nthis amazing elegy in a country churchyard written by a New England\nrecluse, Emily Dickinson:",
        "  “This quiet Dust was Gentlemen and Ladies,\n      And Lads and Girls;\n   Was laughter and ability and sighing,\n      And frocks and curls.\n   This passive place a Summer’s nimble mansion,\n      Where Bloom and Bees\n   Fulfilled their Oriental Circuit,\n      Then ceased like these.”",
        "THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE LYRIC",
        "  “And the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other\n  affections, of desire and pain and pleasure which are held to be\n  inseparable from every action–in all of them poetry feeds and waters\n  the passions instead of withering and starving them; she lets them rule\n  instead of ruling them as they ought to be ruled, with a view to the\n  happiness and virtue of mankind.\"\n    PLATO’S Republic, Book 10",
        "  “A man has no right to say to his own generation, turning quite away\n  from it, ’Be damned!’ It is the whole Past and the whole Future, this\n  same cotton-spinning, dollar-hunting, canting and shrieking, very\n  wretched generation of ours.\"\n    CARLYLE to EMERSON, August 29, 1842\nLet us turn finally to some phases of the contemporary lyric. We shall not\nattempt the hazardous, not to say impossible venture of assessing the\nartistic value of living poets. “Poets are not to be ranked like\ncollegians in a class list,” wrote the wise John Morley long ago.\nCertainly they cannot be ranked until their work is finished. Nor is it\npossible within the limits of this chapter to attempt, upon a smaller\nscale, anything like the task which has been performed so interestingly by\nbooks like Miss Lowell’s Tendencies in Modern American Poetry, Mr.\nUntermeyer’s New Era in American Poetry, Miss Wilkinson’s New Voices,\nand Mr. Lowes’s Convention and Revolt. I wish rather to remind the\nreader, first, of the long-standing case against the lyric, a case\nwhich has been under trial in the court of critical opinion from Plato’s\nday to our own; and then to indicate, even more briefly, the lines of\ndefence. It will be clear, as we proceed, that contemporary verse in\nAmerica and England is illustrating certain general tendencies which not\nonly sharpen the point of the old attack, but also hearten the spirit of\nthe defenders of lyric poetry.",
        "1. Plato’s Moralistic Objection\nNothing could be more timely, as a contribution to a critical battle which\nis just now being waged,\n[Footnote: See the Introduction and the closing chapter of Stuart P.\nSherman’s Contemporary Literature. Holt, 1917.]\nthan the passage from Plato’s Republic which furnishes the motto for the\npresent chapter. It expresses one of those eternal verities which each\ngeneration must face as best it may: “Poetry feeds and waters the passions\ninstead of withering and starving them; she lets them rule instead of\nruling them.” “Did we not imply,” asks the Athenian Stranger in Plato’s\nLaws, “that the poets are not always quite capable of knowing what is\ngood or evil?” “There is also,” says Socrates in the Phoedrus, “a third\nkind of madness, which is the possession of the Muses; this enters into a\ndelicate and virgin soul, and there inspiring frenzy, awakens lyric and\nall other members.” This Platonic notion of lyric “inspiration” and\n\"possession” permeates the immortal passage of the Ion:",
        "  “For all good poets, epic as well as lyric, compose their beautiful\n  poems not as works of art, but because they are inspired and possessed.\n  And as the Corybantian revellers when they dance are not in their right\n  mind, so the lyric poets are not in their right mind when they are\n  composing their beautiful strains: but when falling under the power of\n  music and metre they are inspired and possessed; like Bacchic maidens\n  who draw milk and honey from the rivers, when they are under the\n  influence of Dionysus, but not when they are in their right mind. And\n  the soul of the lyric poet does the same, as they themselves tell us;\n  for they tell us that they gather their strains from honied fountains\n  out of the gardens and dells of the Muses; thither, like the bees, they\n  wing their way. And this is true. For the poet is a light and winged and\n  holy thing, and there is no invention in him until he has been inspired\n  and is out of his senses, and the mind is no longer in him: when he has\n  not attained to this state, he is powerless and is to utter his oracles.\n  Many are the noble words in which poets speak of actions like your own\n  Words about Homer; but they do not speak of them by any rules of art:\n  only when they make that to which the Muse impels them are their\n  inventions inspired; and then one of them will make dithyrambs, another\n  hymns of praise, another choral strains, another epic or iambic\n  verses–and he who is good at one is not good at any other kind of\n  verse: for not by art does the poet sing, but by power divine. Had he\n  learned by rules of art, he would have known how to speak not of one\n  theme only, but of all; and therefore God takes away the minds of poets,\n  and uses them as his ministers, as he also uses diviners and holy\n  prophets, in order that we who hear them may know that they speak not of\n  themselves who utter these priceless words in a state of\n  unconsciousness, but that God is the speaker, and that through them he\n  is conversing with us.\"\n[Footnote: Plato’s Ion, Jowett’s translation.]",
        "The other Platonic notion about poetry being “imitation” colors the\nwell-known section of the third book of the Republic, which warns\nagainst the influence of certain effeminate types of lyric harmony:",
        "  “I answered: Of the harmonies I know nothing, but I want to have one\n  warlike, which will sound the word or note which a brave man utters in\n  the hour of danger and stern resolve, or when his cause is failing and\n  he is going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil, and\n  at every such crisis meets fortune with calmness and endurance; and\n  another which may be used by him in times of peace and freedom of\n  action, when there is no pressure of necessity–expressive of entreaty\n  or persuasion, of prayer to God, or instruction of man, or again, of\n  willingness to listen to persuasion or entreaty and advice; and which\n  represents him when he has accomplished his aim, not carried away by\n  success, but acting moderately and wisely, and acquiescing in the event.\n  These two harmonies I ask you to leave; the strain of necessity and the\n  strain of freedom, the strain of the unfortunate and the strain of the\n  fortunate, the strain of courage, and the strain of temperance; these,\n  I say, leave.”",
        "So runs the famous argument for “the natural rhythms of a manly life,” and\nconversely, the contention that “the absence of grace and rhythm and\nharmony is closely allied to an evil character.” While it is true that the\nbasis for this argument has been modified by our abandonment of the Greek\naesthetic theories of “inspiration” and “imitation,” Plato’s moralistic\nobjection to lyric effeminacy and lyric naturalism is widely shared by\nmany of our contemporaries. They do not find the “New Poetry,” lovely as\nit often is, altogether “manly.” They find on the contrary that some of it\nis what Plato calls “dissolute,” i.e. dissolving or relaxing the fibres of\nthe will, like certain Russian dance-music. I asked an American composer\nthe other day: “Is there anything at all in the old distinction between\nsecular and sacred music?” “Certainly,” he replied; “secular music\nexcites, sacred music exalts.” If this distinction is sound, it is plain\nthat much of the New Poetry aims at excitement of the senses for its\nown sake–or in Plato’s words, at “letting them rule, instead of ruling\nthem as they ought to be ruled.” Or, to use the severe words of a\ncontemporary critic: “They bid us be all eye, no mind; all sense, no\nthought; all chance, all confusion, no order, no organization, no fabric\nof the reason.”",
        "However widely we may be inclined to differ with such moralistic judgments\nas these, it remains true that plenty of idealists hold them, and it is\nthe idealists, rather than the followers of the senses, who have kept the\nlove of poetry alive in our modern world.",
        "2. A Rationalistic Objection\nBut the Philistines, as well as the Platonists, have an indictment to\nbring against modern verse, and particularly against the lyric. They find\nit useless and out of date. Macaulay’s essay on Milton (1825) is one of\nthe classic expressions of “Caledonian” rationalism:",
        "  “We think that as civilization advances, poetry almost necessarily\n  declines.... Language, the machine of the poet, is best fitted for his\n  purpose in its rudest state. Nations, like individuals, first perceive\n  and then abstract. They advance from particular images to general terms.\n  Hence the vocabulary of an enlightened society is philosophical, that of\n  a half-civilized people is poetical....  In proportion as men know more\n  and think more, they look less at individuals, and more at classes. They\n  therefore make better theories and worse poems.... In an enlightened age\n  there will be much intelligence, much science, much philosophy,\n  abundance of just classification and subtle analysis, abundance of wit\n  and eloquence, abundance of verses and even of good ones, but little\n  poetry.” In the essay on Dryden (1828) Macaulay renews the charge:\n  “Poetry requires not an examining but a believing freedom of mind.... As\n  knowledge is extended and as the reason develops itself, the imitative\n  arts decay.”",
        "Even Macaulay, however, is a less pungent and amusing advocate of\nrationalism than Thomas Love Peacock in The Four Ages of Poetry.\n[Footnote: Reprinted in A. S. Cook’s edition of Shelley’s Defense of\nPoetry. Boston, 1891.]",
        "A few sentences must suffice:",
        "  “A poet in our times is a semi-barbarian in a civilized community. He\n  lives in the days that are past. His ideas, thoughts, feelings,\n  associations, are all with barbarous manners, obsolete customs, and\n  exploded superstitions. The march of his intellect is like that of a\n  crab, backward.... The highest inspirations of poetry are resolvable\n  into three ingredients: the rant of unregulated passion, the whining of\n  exaggerated feeling, and the cant of factitious sentiment; and can\n  therefore serve only to ripen a splendid lunatic like Alexander, a\n  puling driveler like Werter, or a morbid dreamer like Wordsworth. It can\n  never make a philosopher, nor a statesman, nor in any class of life a\n  useful or rational man. It cannot claim the slightest share in any one\n  of the comforts and utilities of life, of which we have witnessed so\n  many and so rapid advances.... We may easily conceive that the day is\n  not distant when the degraded state of every species of poetry will be\n  as generally recognized as that of dramatic poetry has long been; and\n  this not from any decrease either of intellectual power or intellectual\n  acquisition, but because intellectual power and intellectual acquisition\n  have turned themselves into other and better channels, and have\n  abandoned the cultivation and the fate of poetry to the degenerate fry\n  of modern rimesters, and their Olympic judges, the magazine critics, who\n  continue to debate and promulgate oracles about poetry as if it were\n  still what it was in the Homeric age, the all-in-all of intellectual\n  progression, and as if there were no such things in existence as\n  mathematicians, historians, politicians, and political economists, who\n  have built into the upper air of intelligence a pyramid, from the summit\n  of which they see the modern Parnassus far beneath them, and knowing how\n  small a place it occupies in the comprehensiveness of their prospect,\n  smile at the little ambition and the circumscribed perceptions with\n  which the drivelers and mountebanks upon it are contending for the\n  poetical palm and the critical chair.”",
        "No one really knows whether Peacock was wholly serious in this diatribe,\nbut inasmuch as it produced Shelley’s Defense of Poetry “as an\nantidote\"–as Shelley said–we should be grateful for it. Both Peacock and\nMacaulay wrote nearly a century ago, but their statements as to the\nuselessness of poetry, as compared with the value of intellectual exertion\nin other fields, is wholly in the spirit of twentieth-century rationalism.\nFew readers of this book may hold that doctrine, but they will meet it on\nevery side; and they will need all they can remember of Sidney and Shelley\nand George Woodberry “as an antidote.”",
        "3. An Aesthetic Objection\nIn Aristotle’s well-known definition of Tragedy in the fifth section of\nthe Poetics, there is one clause, and perhaps only one, which has been\naccepted without debate. “A Tragedy, then, is an artistic imitation of an\naction that is serious, complete in itself, and of an adequate\nmagnitude.” Does a lyric possess “an adequate magnitude?” As the\nembodiment of a single aspect of feeling, and therefore necessarily brief,\nthe lyric certainly lacks “mass.” As an object for aesthetic\ncontemplation, is the average lyric too small to afford the highest and\nmost permanent pleasure? “A long poem,” remarks A. C. Bradley in his\nOxford Lectures on Poetry,\n[Footnote: London, 1909. The passage cited is from the chapter on “The\nLong Poem in the Age of Wordsworth.\"]\n\"requires imaginative powers superfluous in a short one, and it would be\neasy to show that it admits of strictly poetic effects of the highest\nvalue which the mere brevity of a short one excludes.” Surely the lyric,\nlike the short story, cannot see life steadily and whole. It reflects, as\nwe have seen, a single situation or desire. “Short swallow-flights of\nsong\"; piping “as the linnet sings\"; have not the lyric poets themselves\nconfessed this inherent shortcoming of their art in a thousand similes?\nDoes not a book of lyrics often seem like a plantation of carefully tended\nlittle trees, rather than a forest? The most ardent collector of\nbutterflies is aware that he is hunting only butterflies and not big game.\nMr. John Gould Fletcher’s Japanese Prints is a collection of the\ndaintiest lyric fragments, lovely as a butterfly’s wing. But do such\nlyrics lack “adequate magnitude”?",
        "It seems to the present writer that this old objection is a real one, and\nthat it is illustrated afresh by contemporary poetry, but that it is not\nso much an argument against the lyric as such, as it is an explanation of\nthe ineffectiveness of certain lyric poems. This defect is not primarily\nthat they lack “magnitude,” but rather that they lack an adequate basis in\nour emotional adjustment to the fact or situation upon which they turn.\nThe reader is not prepared for the effect which they convey. The art of\nthe drama was defined by the younger Dumas as the art of preparation. Now\nthe lyrics which are most effective in primarily dramatic compositions,\nlet us say the songs in “Pippa Passes” or Ariel’s songs in The Tempest,\nare those where the train of emotional association or contrast has been\ncarefully laid and is waiting to be touched off. So it is with the\nmarkedly lyrical passages in narrative verse–say the close of “Sohrab and\nRustum.” When a French actress sings the “Marseillaise” to a theatre\naudience in war-time, or Sir Harry Lauder, dressed in kilts, sings\nto a Scottish-born audience about “the bonny purple heather,” or a\nmarching regiment strikes up “Dixie,” the actual song is only the release\nof a mood already stimulated. But when one comes upon an isolated lyric\nprinted as a “filler” at the bottom of a magazine page, there is no train\nof emotional association whatever. There is no lyric mood waiting to\nrespond to a “lyric cry.” To overcome this obstacle, Walter Page and other\nmagazine editors, a score of years ago, made the experiment of printing\nall the verse together, instead of scattering it according to the\nexigencies of the “make-up.” Miss Monroe’s Poetry, Contemporary Verse,\nand the other periodicals devoted exclusively to poetry, easily avoid this\nhandicap of intruding prose. One turns their pages as he turns leaves of\nmusic until he finds some composition in accordance with his mood of the\nmoment. The long poem or the drama creates an undertone of feeling\nin which the lyrical mood may easily come to its own, based and reinforced\nas it is by the larger poetical structure. The isolated magazine lyric, on\nthe other hand, is like one swallow trying to make a summer. Even the\nlyrics collected in anthologies are often “mutually repellent particles,\"\nrequiring through their very brevity and lack of relation with one\nanother, a perpetual re-focussing of the attention, a constant re-creation\nof lyric atmosphere. These conditions have been emphasized, during the\nlast decade, by that very variety of technical experimentation, that\nincreased range and individualism of lyric effort, which have renewed the\ninterest in American poetry.",
        "4. Subjectivity as a Curse\nI have often thought of a conversation with Samuel Asbury, a dozen years\nago, about a friend of ours, a young Southern poet of distinct promise,\nwho had just died. Like many Southern verse-writers of his generation, he\nhad lived and written under the inspiration of Poe. Asbury surprised me by\nthe almost bitter remark that Poe’s influence had been a blight upon the\nyounger Southern poets, inasmuch as it had tended to over-subjectivity, to\nmorbid sensibility, and to a pre-occupation with purely personal emotions.\nHe argued, as he has since done so courageously in his Texas Nativist,\n[Footnote: Published by the author at College Station, Texas.]\nthat more objective forms of poetry, particularly epic and dramatic\nhandling of local and historic American material, was far healthier stuff\nfor a poet to work with.",
        "This objection to the lyric as an encourager of subjective excitement, of\negoistic introspection, like the other objections already stated, is one\nof old standing. Goethe remarked that the subjectivity of the smaller\npoets was of no significance, but that they were interested in nothing\nreally objective. But though this indictment of over-individualism has\noften been drawn, our own times are a fresh proof of its validity. If the\nrevelation of personality unites men, the stress upon mere individuality\nseparates them, and there are countless poets of the day who glory in\ntheir eccentric individualism without remembering that it is only through\na richly developed personality that poetry gains any universal values.\n\"Nothing in literature is so perishable as eccentricity, with regard to\nwhich each generation has its own requirements and its own standard of\ntaste; and the critic who urges contemporary poets to make their work as\nindividual as possible is deliberately inviting them to build their\nstructures on sand instead of rock.\"\n[Footnote: Edmond Holmes, What is Poetry, p. 68.]\nEvery reader of contemporary poetry is aware that along with its\nexhilarating freshness and force there has been a display of singularity\nand of silly nudity both of body and mind. Too intimate confidences have\nbeen betrayed in the lyric confessional. It is a fine thing to see a\nVarsity eight take their dip in the river at the end of an afternoon’s\nspin. Those boys strip well. But there are middle-aged poets who strip\nvery badly. Nature never intended them to play the role of Narcissus.\nDickens wrote great novels in a room so hung with mirrors that he could\nwatch himself in the act of composition. But that is not the best sort of\nwriting-room for lyric poets, particularly in a decade when acute\nself-consciousness, race-consciousness and even coterie-consciousness are\nexploited for commercial purposes, and the “lutanists of October” are duly\nphotographed at their desks.",
        "5. Mere Technique\nThere is one other count in the old indictment of the lyric which is sure\nto be emphasized whenever any generation, like our own, shows a new\ntechnical curiosity about lyric forms. It is this: that mere technique\nwill “carry” a lyric, even though thought, passion and imagination be\nlacking. This charge will inevitably be made from time to time, and not\nmerely by the persons who naturally tend to stress the content-value of\npoetry as compared with its form-value. It was Stedman, who was peculiarly\nsusceptible to the charm of varied lyric form, who remarked of some of\nPoe’s lyrics, “The libretto (i.e. the sense) is nothing, the score is all\nin all.” And it must be admitted that the “libretto” of “Ulalume,” for\ninstance, is nearly or quite meaningless to many lovers of poetry who\nvalue the “score” very highly. In a period marked by enthusiasm for new\nexperiments in versification, new feats of technique, the borderland\nbetween real conquests of novel territory and sheer nonsense verse\nbecomes very hazy. The Spectra hoax, perpetrated so cleverly in 1916 by\nMr. Ficke and Mr. Witter Bynner, fooled many of the elect.\n[Footnote: See Untermeyer’s New Era, etc., pp. 320-23.]\nI have never believed that Emerson meant to decry Poe when he referred to\nhim as “the jingle-man.” Emerson’s memory for names was faulty, and he was\ntrying to indicate the author of the",
        "  “tintinnabulation of the bells.”",
        "That Poe was a prestidigitator with verse, and may be regarded solely with\na view to his professional expertness, is surely no ground for disparaging\nhim as a poet. But it is the kind of penalty which extraordinary technical\nexpertness has to pay in all the arts. Many persons remember Paganini only\nas the violinist who could play upon a single string. Every ’amplificolor\nimperii“–every widener of the bounds of the empire of poetry, like\nVachel Lindsay with his experiments in chanted verse, Robert Frost with\nhis subtle renderings of the cadences of actual speech, Miss Amy Lowell\nwith her doctrine of “curves” and “returns” and polyphony–runs the risk\nof being regarded for a while as a technician and nothing more. Ultimately\na finer balance is struck between the claims of form and content: the\nideas of a poet, his total vision of life, his contribution to the thought\nas well as to the craftsmanship of his generation, are thrown into the\nscale. Victor Hugo is now seen to be something far other than the mere\namazing lyric virtuoso of the Odes et Ballades of 1826. Walt Whitman\nultimately gets judged as Walt Whitman, and not merely as the inventor\nof a new type of free verse in 1855. A rough justice is done at last, no\ndoubt, but for a long time the cleverest and most original manipulators of\nwords and tunes are likely to be judged by their virtuosity alone.",
        "6. The Lines of Defence\nThe objections to lyric poetry which have just been rehearsed are of\nvarying degrees of validity. They have been mentioned here because they\nstill affect, more or less, the judgment of the general public as it\nendeavors to estimate the value of the contemporary lyric. I have little\nconfidence in the taste of professed admirers of poetry who can find no\npleasure in contemporary verse, and still less confidence in the taste of\nour contemporaries whose delight in the “new era” has made them deaf to\nthe great poetic voices of the past. I am sorry for the traditionalist who\ncannot enjoy Robert Frost and Edwin Arlington Robinson and Edgar Lee\nMasters and Carl Sandburg. He is, in my opinion, in a parlous state. But\nthe state of the young rebel who cannot enjoy “Lycidas” and “The Progress\nof Poesy” and the “Ode to Dejection” is worse than parlous. It is\nhopeless.",
        "It is not for him, therefore, that these final paragraphs are written, but\nrather for those lovers of poetry who recognize that it transcends all\npurely moralistic and utilitarian, as it does all historical and technical\nconsiderations,–that it lifts the reader into a serene air where beauty\nand truth abide, while the perplexed generations of men appear and\ndisappear. Sidney and Campion and Daniel pleaded its cause for the\nElizabethans, Coleridge and Wordsworth and Shelley defended it against the\nGeorgian Philistines, Carlyle, Newman and Arnold championed it through\nevery era of Victorian materialism. In the twentieth century, critics like\nMackail and A. C. Bradley and Rhys, poets like Newbolt and Drinkwater and\nMasefield–to say nothing of living poets and critics among our own\ncountrymen–have spoken out for poetry with a knowledge, a sympathy and an\neloquence unsurpassed in any previous epoch. The direct “Defence of\nPoetry” may safely be left to such men as these.",
        "I have chosen, rather, the line of indirect vindication of poetry, and\nparticularly of the lyric, which has been attempted in this book. We have\nseen that the same laws are perpetually at work in poetry as in all the\nother arts; that we have to do with the transmission of a certain kind of\nfeeling through a certain medium; that the imagination remoulds the\nmaterial proffered by the senses, and brings into order the confused and\nbroken thoughts of the mind, until it presents the eternal aspect of\nthings through words that dance to music. We have seen that the study of\npoetry leads us back to the psychic life of primitive races, to the\norigins of language and of society, and to the underlying spirit of\ninstitutions and nationalities, so that even a fragment of surviving lyric\nverse may be recognized as a part of those unifying and dividing\nforces that make up the life of the world. We have found poetry,\nfurthermore, to be the great personal mode of literary expression, a\nrevelation of noble personality as well as base, and that this personal\nmode of expression has continued to hold its own in the modern world. The\nfolk-epic is gone, the art-epic has been outstripped by prose fiction, and\nthe drama needs a theatre. But the lyric needs only a poet, who can\ncompose in any of its myriad forms. No one who knows contemporary\nliterature will deny that the lyric is now interpreting the finer spirit\nof science, the drift of social progress, and above all, the instincts of\npersonal emotion. Through it to-day, as never before in the history of\ncivilization, the heart of a man can reach the heart of mankind. It is\ninconceivable that the lyric will not grow still more significant\nwith time, freighted more and more deeply with thought and passion and\ntouched with a richer and more magical beauty. Some appreciation of it, no\nmatter how inadequate, should be a part of the spiritual possessions of\nevery civilized man.’",

        "I add here some suggestions to teachers who may wish to use this book in\nthe classroom. In connection with each chapter I have indicated the more\nimportant discussions of the special topic. There is also some additional\nillustrative material, and I have indicated a few hints for classroom\nexercises, following methods which have proved helpful in my own\nexperience as a teacher.",
        "I have tried to keep in mind the needs of two kinds of college courses in\npoetry. One of them is the general introductory course, which usually\nbegins with the lyric rather than with the epic or the drama, and which\nutilizes some such collection as the Golden Treasury or the Oxford Book\nof English Verse. Any such collection of standard verse, or any of the\nanthologies of recent poetry, like those selected by Miss Jessie B.\nRittenhouse or Mr. W. S. Braithwaite, should be constantly in use in the\nclassroom as furnishing concrete illustration of the principles discussed\nin books like mine.",
        "The other kind of course which I have had in mind is the one dealing with\nthe works of a single poet. Spenser, Milton, Wordsworth, Tennyson,\nBrowning, are among the poets most frequently chosen for this sort of\nstudy. I have found it an advantage to carry on the discussion of the\ngeneral principles of poetic imagination and expression in connection with\nthe close textual study of the complete work of any one poet. It is hoped\nthat this book may prove helpful for such a purpose.",
        "This chapter aims to present, in as simple a form as possible, some of the\nfundamental questions in aesthetic theory as far as they bear upon the\nstudy of poetry. James Sully’s article on “Aesthetics” in the\nEncyclopaedia Britannica, and Sidney Colvin’s article on “The Fine\nArts,” afford a good preliminary survey of the field. K. Gordon’s\nAesthetics, E. D. Puffer’s Psychology of Beauty, Santayana’s Sense of\nBeauty, Raymond’s Genesis of Art Form, and Arthur Symons’s Seven\nArts, are stimulating books. Bosanquet’s Three Lectures on Aesthetic is\ncommended to those advanced students who have not time to read his\nvoluminous History of Aesthetic, just as Lane Cooper’s translation of\nAristotle on the Art of Poetry may be read profitably before taking up\nthe more elaborate discussions in Butcher’s Aristotle’s Theory of Poetry\nand Fine Art. In the same way, Spingarn’s Creative Criticism is a good\npreparation for Croce’s monumental Aesthetics. The student should\ncertainly make some acquaintance with Lessing’s Laokoon, and he will\nfind Babbitt’s New Laokoon a brilliant and trenchant survey of the old\nquestions.",
        "It may be, however, that the teacher will prefer to pass rapidly over the\nground covered in this chapter, rather than to run the risk of confusing\nhis students with problems admittedly difficult. In that case the\nclassroom discussions may begin with chapter II. I have found, however,\nthat the new horizons which are opened to many students in connection with\nthe topics touched upon in chapter I more than make up for some temporary\nbewilderment.",
        "The need here is to look at an old subject with fresh eyes. Teachers who\nare fond of music or painting or sculpture can invent many illustrations\nfollowing the hint given in the Orpheus and Eurydice passage in the text.\nAmong recent books, Fairchild’s Making of Poetry and Max Eastman’s\nEnjoyment of Poetry are particularly to be commended for their\nunconventional point of view. See also Fairchild’s pamphlet on Teaching\nof Poetry in the High School, and John Erskine’s paper on “The Teaching\nof Poetry” (Columbia University Quarterly, December, 1915). Alfred\nHayes’s “Relation of Music to Poetry” (Atlantic, January, 1914) is\npertinent to this chapter. But the student should certainly familiarize\nhimself with Theodore Watts-Dunton’s famous article on “Poetry” in\nthe Encyclopaedia Britannica, now reprinted with additions in his\nRenascence of Wonder. He should also read A. C. Bradley’s chapter on\n\"Poetry for its Own Sake” in the Oxford Lectures on Poetry, Neilson’s\nEssentials of Poetry, Stedman’s Nature and Elements of Poetry, as well\nas the classic “Defences” of Poetry by Philip Sidney, Shelley, Leigh Hunt\nand George E. Woodberry. For advanced students, R. P. Cowl’s Theory of\nPoetry in England is a useful summary of critical opinions covering\nalmost every aspect of the art of poetry, as it has been understood by\nsuccessive generations of Englishmen.",
        "This chapter, like the first, will be difficult for some students. They\nmay profitably read, in connection with it, Professor Winchester’s chapter\non “Imagination” in his Literary Criticism, Neilson’s discussion of\n\"Imagination” in his Essentials of Poetry, the first four chapters of\nFairchild, chapters 4, 13, 14, and 15 of Coleridge’s Biographia\nLiteraria, and Wordsworth’s Preface to his volume of Poems of 1815.

        "Under section 2, some readers may be interested in Sir William Rowan\nHamilton’s account of his famous discovery of the quaternion analysis, one\nof the greatest of all discoveries in pure mathematics:",
        "  “Quaternions started into life, or light, full grown,\n  on Monday, the 16th of October, 1843, as I was walking\n  with Lady Hamilton to Dublin, and came up to\n  Brougham Bridge, which my boys have since called the\n  Quaternion Bridge. That is to say, I then and there\n  felt the galvanic circuit of thought close, and the sparks\n  which fell from it were the fundamental equations between\n  i, j, k; exactly such as I have used them ever since.\n  I pulled out on the spot a pocket-book, which still exists,\n  and made an entry on which, at the very moment, I felt\n  that it might be worth my while to expend the labor of\n  at least ten (or it might be fifteen) years to come. But\n  then it is fair to say that this was because I felt a problem  to have been at that moment solved–an intellectual\n  want relieved–which had haunted me for at least\n  ifteen years before. Less than an hour elapsed before I\n  had asked and obtained leave of the Council of the\n  Royal Irish Academy, of which Society I was, at that\n  time, the President–to read at the next General Meeting  a Paper on Quaternions; which I accordingly did, on\n  November 13, 1843.”",
        "The following quotation from Lascelles-Abercrombie’s study of Thomas Hardy\npresents in brief compass the essential problem dealt with in this\nchapter. It is closely written, and should be read more than once.",
        "  “Man’s intercourse with the world is necessarily formative. His\n  experience of things outside his consciousness is in the manner of a\n  chemistry, wherein some energy of his nature is mated with the energy\n  brought in on his nerves from externals, the two combining into\n  something which exists only in, or perhaps we should say closely around,\n  man’s consciousness. Thus what man knows of the world is what has been\n  formed by the mixture of his own nature with the streaming in of the\n  external world. This formative energy of his, reducing the in-coming\n  world into some constant manner of appearance which may be appreciable\n  by consciousness, is most conveniently to be described, it seems, as an\n  unaltering imaginative desire: desire which accepts as its material, and\n  fashions itself forth upon, the many random powers sent by the world to\n  invade man’s mind. That there is this formative energy in man may easily\n  be seen by thinking of certain dreams; those dreams, namely, in which\n  some disturbance outside the sleeping brain (such as a sound of knocking\n  or a bodily discomfort) is completely formed into vivid trains of\n  imagery, and in that form only is presented to the dreamer’s\n  consciousness. This, however, merely shows the presence of the active\n  desire to shape sensation into what consciousness can accept; the dream\n  is like an experiment done in the isolation of a laboratory; there are\n  so many conflicting factors when we are awake that the events of sleep\n  must only serve as a symbol or diagram of the intercourse of mind with\n  that which is not mind–intercourse which only takes place in a region\n  where the outward radiations of man’s nature combine with the\n  irradiations of the world. Perception itself is a formative act; and all\n  the construction of sensation into some orderly, coherent idea of the\n  world is a further activity of the central imaginative desire. Art is\n  created, and art is enjoyed, because in it man may himself completely\n  express and exercise those inmost desires which in ordinary experience\n  are by no means to be completely expressed. Life has at last been\n  perfectly formed and measured to man’s requirements; and in art man\n  knows himself truly the master of his existence. It is this sense of\n  mastery which gives man that raised and delighted consciousness of self\n  which art provokes.”",
        "I regret that Professor Lowes’s brilliant discussion of “Poetic Diction\"\nin his Convention and Revolt did not appear until after this chapter was\nwritten. There are stimulating remarks on Diction in Fairchild and\nEastman, in Raleigh’s Wordsworth, in L. A.

Coleridge’s description of\nWordsworth’s theory of poetic diction in the Biographia Literaria is\nfamous.

        "“It is a well-known property of human speech that it keeps up a ceaseless\nchange between accented and unaccented syllables. A long succession of\naccented syllables becomes unbearably monotonous; a long succession of\nunaccented syllables is, in effect, impossible. Now when the ear detects\nat regular intervals a recurrence of accented syllables, varying with\nunaccented, it perceives Rhythm. Measured intervals of time are the\nbasis of all verse, and their regularity marks off poetry from prose; so\nthat Time is thus the chief element in Poetry, as it is in Music and in\nDancing. From the idea of measuring these time-intervals, we derive the\nname Metre; Rhythm means pretty much the same thing,–’a flowing,’ an\neven, measured motion. This rhythm is found everywhere in nature: the beat\nof the heart, the ebb and flow of the sea, the alternation of day and\nnight. Rhythm is not artificial, not an invention; it lies at the heart of\nthings, and in rhythm the noblest emotions find their noblest expression.\"\n    GUMMERE, Handbook of Poetics, p. 133.",

Two streams of sound pass constantly through the inner ear of\none who understands or appreciates the rhythm of our verse: one, never\nactually found in the real sounds which are uttered, is the absolute\nrhythm, its equal time-intervals moving on in infinitely perfect\nprogression; the other, represented by the actual movement of the verse,\nis constantly shifting by quickening, retarding, strengthening or\nweakening its sounds, yet always hovers along the line of the perfect\nrhythm, and bids the ear refer to that perfect rhythm the succession of\nits pulsations.\"\n    ALDEN, An Introduction to Poetry, p. 188.",

        "  ’Full-sailed, wide-winged, poised softly forever asway?’",
        "The usual explanation of this line is that Mr. Swinburne, carelessly,\ninadvertently, or for some occult purpose, interjected one line of five\nfeet among his hexameters and the scansion usually followed is by\narrangement into a pentameter, thus:",

He would never overlook a line of\nfive feet in a poem of hexameters. But–as will, I think, appear later and\nconclusively–the line is really of six feet, and is not iambic, trochaic,\nanapaestic, the spurious spondaic that some writers have tried to\nmanufacture for English verse, or anything else recognized in Coleridge’s\nimmortal stanza, or in text-books. It simply cannot be scanned by\nclassical rules; it cannot be weighed justly, and its full meaning\nextracted, by any of the ’trip-time’ or ’march-time’ expedients of other\ninvestigators. It is purely music; and when read by the method of music\nappears perfectly designed and luminous with significance.

Hexameters had given voice to\nmany emotions beautifully, with unfailing modulation of calm or storm.\nThey had never revealed the infinite heart of God, or told the yearning of\nthe soul responding; nor were they ever to be the instrument of these\nsupreme disclosures in Christian times. Such unmeasured feelings could not\nbe held within the controlled harmonies of the hexameter nor within\nsapphic or alcaic or Pindaric strophes. These antique forms of poetry\ndefinitely expressed their contents, although sometimes suggesting further\nunspoken feeling, which is so noticeable with Virgil. But characteristic\nChristian poetry, like the Latin mediaeval hymn, was not to express its\nmeaning as definitely or contain its significance. Mediaeval hymns are\nchildlike, having often a narrow clearness in their literal sense; and\nthey may be childlike, too, in their expressed symbolism. Their\nsignificance reaches far beyond their utterance; they suggest, they echo,\nand they listen; around them rolls the voice of God, the infinitude of\nHis love and wrath, heaven’s chorus and hell’s agonies; dies irae, dies\nilla–that line says little, but mountains of wrath press on it, from\nwhich the soul shall not escape.",

What themes are of mythical or legendary origin? Of those having\na historical basis, how many are drawn from English sources?

For this paper, however, please confine your criticism\nto “Queen Mary,” “Harold,” “Becket,” “The Cup,” “The Falcon,” “The Promise\nof May,” and “The Foresters.” In studying “Becket,” compare Irving’s stage\nversion of the play (Macmillan).]",

Give illustrations, from the plays, of the conflict of the\nindividual with institutions.",
        "God. Comment upon Tennyson’s doctrine of necessity and retribution. Does\nhis allotment of poetic justice show a sympathy with the moral order of\nthe world? Are these plays in harmony with Tennyson’s theology, as\nindicated elsewhere in his work? Do they contain any clear exposition of\nthe problems of the religious life?",
        "B. Compare Topic II, B. In the historical dramas, can you trace the\ninfluence of the poet’s own personality in giving color to historical\npersonages? Compare Tennyson’s delineation of any of these personages with\nthat of other poets, novelists, or historians. Do you think he has the\npower of creating a character, in the same sense as Shakespeare had it?\nHow much of his dramatic work do you consider purely objective, i. e.,\nuntinged by what was called the lyric egoism?",
        "C. What may be said in general of Tennyson’s handling of the dramatic\nform? Has he “the dramatic sense”? Of his management of the web of\ncircumstance in which the characters are involved and brought into\nconflict? Comment upon his technical skill as displayed in the different\n\"parts” and “moments” of his dramas. Does his exhibition of action fulfill\ndramatic requirements? Is his vocabulary suited to stage purposes? Give\ninstances of his purely lyric and narrative gifts as incidentally\nillustrated in his dramas. Instance passages that cannot in your opinion\nbe successfully acted. In your reading of these plays, or observation of\nany of them that you have seen acted, are you conscious of the absence of\nany quality or qualities that would heighten the pleasure they yield you?\nTaken as a whole, is the form of the various plays artistically in\nharmony with the themes employed?",
