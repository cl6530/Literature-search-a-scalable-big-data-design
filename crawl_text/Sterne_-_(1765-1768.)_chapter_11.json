        "In the first week of October, 1765, or a few days later, Sterne\nset out on what was afterwards to become famous as the “Sentimental\nJourney through France and Italy.” Not, of course, that all the\nmaterials for that celebrated piece of literary travel were collected\non this occasion. From London as far as Lyons his way lay by a route\nwhich he had already traversed three years before, and there is\nreason to believe that at least some of the scenes in the Sentimental\nJourney were drawn from observation made on his former visit. His\nstay in Paris was shorter this year than it had been on the previous\noccasion. A month after leaving England he was at Pont Beauvoisin,\nand by the middle of November he had reached Turin. From this city he\nwrites, with his characteristic simplicity: “I am very happy, and\nhave found my way into a dozen houses already. To-morrow I am to be\npresented to the King, and when that ceremony is over I shall have my\nhands full of engagements.” From Turin he went on, by way of Milan,\nParma, Piacenza, and Bologna, to Florence, where, after three days’\nstay, “to dine with our Plenipo,” he continued his journey to\nRome. Here, and at Naples, he passed the winter of 1765-’66,[1]\nand prolonged his stay in Italy until the ensuing spring was well\nadvanced. In the month of May he was again on his way home, through\nFrance, and had had a meeting, after two years’ separation from them,\nwith his wife and daughter. His account of it to Hall Stevenson is\ncurious: “Never man,” he writes, “has been such a wild-goose chase\nafter his wife as I have been. After having sought her in five or six\ndifferent towns, I found her at last in Franche Comté. Poor woman!\"\nhe adds, “she was very cordial, &c.” The &c. is charming. But\nher cordiality had evidently no tendency to deepen into any more\nimpassioned sentiment, for she “begged to stay another year or so.\"\nAs to “my Lydia\"–the real cause, we must suspect, of Sterne’s having\nturned out of his road–she, he says, “pleases me much. I found her\ngreatly improved in everything I wished her.” As to himself: “I am\nmost unaccountably well, and most accountably nonsensical. ’Tis at\nleast a proof of good spirits, which is a sign and token, in these\nlatter days, that I must take up my pen. In faith, I think I shall\ndie with it in my hand; but I shall live these ten years, my Antony,\nnotwithstanding the fears of my wife, whom I left most melancholy\non that account.” The “fears” and the melancholy were, alas! to be\njustified, rather than the “good spirits;” and the shears of Atropos\nwere to close, not in ten years, but in little more than twenty\nmonths, upon that fragile thread of life.",
        "[Footnote 1: It was on this tour that Sterne picked up the French\nvalet Lafleur, whom he introduced as a character into the Sentimental\nJourney, but whose subsequently published recollections of the tour\n(if, indeed, the veritable Lafleur was the author of the notes from\nwhich Scott quotes so freely) appear, as Mr. Fitzgerald has pointed\nout, from internal evidence to be mostly fictitious.]",
        "By the end of June he was back again in his Yorkshire home, and very\nsoon after had settled down to work upon the ninth and last volume of\nTristram Shandy. He was writing, however, as it should seem,\nunder something more than the usual distractions of a man with two\nestablishments. Mrs. Sterne was just then ill at Marseilles, and her\nhusband–who, to do him justice, was always properly solicitous for\nher material comfort–was busy making provision for her to change her\nquarters to Chalons. He writes to M. Panchaud, at Paris, sending fifty\npounds, and begging him to make her all further advances that might be\nnecessary. “I have,” he says, “such entire confidence in my wife\nthat she spends as little as she can, though she is confined to no\nparticular sum ... and you may rely–in case she should draw for fifty\nor a hundred pounds extraordinary–that it and every demand shall\nbe punctually paid, and with proper thanks; and for this the whole\nShandian family are ready to stand security.” Later on, too, he writes\nthat “a young nobleman is now inaugurating a jaunt with me for six\nweeks, about Christmas, to the Faubourg St. Germain;” and he adds–in\na tone the sincerity of which he would himself have probably found\na difficulty in gauging–\"if my wife should grow worse (having had a\nvery poor account of her in my daughter’s last), I cannot think of her\nbeing without me; and, however expensive the journey would be, I would\nfly to Avignon to administer consolation to her and my poor girl.[1]”",
        "[Footnote 1: There can be few admirers of Sterne’s genius who\nwould not gladly incline, whenever they find it possible, to Mr.\nFitzgerald’s very indulgent estimate of his disposition. But this\nis only one of many instances in which the charity of the\nbiographer appears to me to be, if the expression may be permitted,\nunconscionable. I can, at any rate, find no warrant whatever in the\nabove passage for the too kindly suggestion that “Sterne was actually\nnegotiating a journey to Paris as ’bear-leader’ to a young nobleman\n(an odious office, to which he had special aversion), in order that\nhe might with economy fly over to Avignon.\"]",
        "The necessity for this flight, however, did not arise. Better\naccounts of Mrs. Sterne arrived a few weeks later, and the husband’s\nconsolations were not required.",
        "Meanwhile the idyll of Captain Shandy’s love-making was gradually\napproaching completion; and there are signs to be met with–in\nthe author’s correspondence, that is to say, and not in the work\nitself–that he was somewhat impatient to be done with it, at any rate\nfor the time. “I shall publish,” he says, “late in this year; and the\nnext I shall begin a new work of four volumes, which, when finished,\nI shall continue Tristram with fresh spirit.” The new work in\nfour volumes (not destined to get beyond one) was, of course, the\nSentimental Journey. His ninth volume of Tristram Shandy was\nfinished by the end of the year, and at Christmas he came up to\nLondon, after his usual practice, to see to its publication and enjoy\nthe honours of its reception. The book passed duly through the press,\nand in the last days of January was issued the announcement of its\nimmediate appearance. Of the character of its welcome I can find no\nother evidence than that of Sterne himself, in a letter addressed to\nM. Panchaud some fortnight after the book appeared. “’Tis liked the\nbest of all here;” but, with whatever accuracy this may have expressed\nthe complimentary opinion of friends, or even the well-considered\njudgment of critics, one can hardly believe that it enjoyed anything\nlike the vogue of the former volumes. Sterne, however, would be the\nless concerned for this, that his head was at the moment full of\nhis new venture. “I am going,” he writes, “to publish A Sentimental\nJourney through France and Italy. The undertaking is protected and\nhighly encouraged by all our noblesse. ’Tis subscribed for at a great\nrate ’twill be an original, in large quarto, the subscription half a\nguinea. If you (Panchaud) can procure me the honour of a few names of\nmen of science or fashion, I shall thank you: they will appear in good\ncompany, as all the nobility here have honoured me with their names.\"\nAs was usual with him, however, he postponed commencing it until he\nshould have returned to Coxwold; and, as was equally usual with\nhim, he found it difficult to tear himself away from the delights\nof London. Moreover, there was in the present instance a special\ndifficulty, arising out of an affair upon which, as it has relations\nwith the history of Sterne’s literary work, it would be impossible,\neven in the most strictly critical and least general of biographies,\nto observe complete silence. I refer, of course, to the famous and\nfurious flirtation with Mrs. Draper–the Eliza of the Yorick and Eliza\nLetters. Of the affair itself but little need be said. I have already\nstated my own views on the general subject of Sterne’s love affairs;\nand I feel no inducement to discuss the question of their innocence\nor otherwise in relation to this particular amourette. I will only\nsay that were it technically as innocent as you please, the mean\nwhich must be found between Thackeray’s somewhat too harsh and Mr.\nFitzgerald’s considerably too indulgent judgment on it will lie,\nit seems to me, decidedly nearer to the former than to the latter’s\nextreme. This episode of violently sentimental philandering with an\nIndian “grass widow” was, in any case, an extremely unlovely passage\nin Sterne’s life. On the best and most charitable view of it, the\nflirtation, pursued in the way it was, and to the lengths to which\nit was carried, must be held to convict the elderly lover of the most\ndeplorable levity, vanity, indiscretion, and sickly sentimentalism. It\nwas, to say the least of it, most unbecoming in a man of Sterne’s age\nand profession; and when it is added that Yorick’s attentions to Eliza\nwere paid in so open a fashion as to be brought by gossip to the ears\nof his neglected wife, then living many hundred miles away from him,\nits highly reprehensible character seems manifest enough in all ways.",
        "No sooner, however, had the fascinating widow set sail, than the\nsentimental lover began to feel so strongly the need of a female\nconsoler, that his heart seems to have softened, insensibly, even\ntowards his wife. “I am unhappy,” he writes plaintively to Lydia\nSterne. “Thy mother and thyself at a distance from me–and what can\ncompensate for such a destitution? For God’s sake persuade her to come\nand fix in England! for life is too short to waste in separation;\nand while she lives in one country and I in another, many people will\nsuppose it proceeds from choice\"–a supposition, he seems to imply,\nwhich even my scrupulously discreet conduct in her absence scarcely\nsuffices to refute. “Besides\"–a word in which there is here almost\nas much virtue as in an “if\"–\"I want thee near me, thou child and\ndarling of my heart. I am in a melancholy mood, and my Lydia’s eyes\nwill smart with weeping when I tell her the cause that just now\naffects me.” And then his sensibilities brim over, and into his\ndaughter’s ear he pours forth his lamentations over the loss of her\nmother’s rival. “I am apprehensive the dear friend I mentioned in my\nlast letter is going into a decline. I was with her two days ago, and\nI never beheld a being so altered. She has a tender frame, and looks\nlike a drooping lily, for the roses are fled from her cheeks. I can\nnever see or talk to this incomparable woman without bursting into\ntears. I have a thousand obligations to her, and I love her more than\nher whole sex, if not all the world put together. She has a delicacy,\"\n&c., &c. And after reciting a frigid epitaph which he had written,\n“expressive of her modest worth,” he winds up with–\"Say all that is\nkind of me to thy mother; and believe me, my Lydia, that I love\nthee most truly.” My excuse for quoting thus fully from this most\ncharacteristic letter, and, indeed, for dwelling at all upon these\nclosing incidents of the Yorick and Eliza episode, is, that in their\nstriking illustration of the soft, weak, spiritually self-indulgent\nnature of the man, they assist us, far more than many pages of\ncriticism would do, to understand one particular aspect of his\nliterary idiosyncrasy. The sentimentalist of real life explains the\nsentimentalist in art.",
        "In the early days of May Sterne managed at last to tear himself away\nfrom London and its joys, and with painful slowness, for he was now in\na wretched state of health, to make his way back to Yorkshire. “I have\ngot conveyed,” he says in a distressing letter from Newark to Hall\nStevenson–\"I have got conveyed thus far like a bale of cadaverous\ngoods consigned to Pluto and Company, lying in the bottom of my chaise\nmost of the route, upon a large pillow which I had the prévoyance to\npurchase before I set out. I am worn out, but pass on to Barnby Moor\nto-night, and if possible to York the next. I know not what is the\nmatter with me, but some derangement presses hard upon this machine.\nStill, I think it will not be overset this bout\"–another of those\nutterances of a cheerful courage under the prostration of pain which\nreveal to us the manliest side of Sterne’s nature. On reaching Coxwold\nhis health appears to have temporarily mended, and in June we find him\ngiving a far better account of himself to another of his friends. The\nfresh Yorkshire air seems to have temporarily revived him, and to his\nfriend, Arthur Lee, a young American, he writes thus: “I am as happy\nas a prince at Coxwold, and I wish you could see in how princely a\nmanner I live. ’Tis a land of plenty. I sit down alone to dinner–fish\nand wild-fowl, or a couple of fowls or ducks, with cream and all the\nsimple plenty which a rich valley under Hamilton Hills can produce,\nwith a clean cloth on my table, and a bottle of wine on my right hand\nto drink your health. I have a hundred hens and chickens about my\nyard; and not a parishioner catches a hare, a rabbit, or a trout but\nhe brings it as an offering to me.” Another of his correspondents at\nthis period was the Mrs. H. of his letters, whose identity I have been\nunable to trace, but who is addressed in a manner which seems to show\nSterne’s anxiety to expel the old flame of Eliza’s kindling by a new\none. There is little, indeed, of the sentimentalizing strain in which\nhe was wont to sigh at the feet of Mrs. Draper, but in its place\nthere is a freedom of a very prominent, and here and there of a highly\nunpleasant, kind. To his friends, Mr. and Mrs. James, too, he writes\nfrequently during this year, chiefly to pour out his soul on the\nsubject of Eliza; and Mrs. James, who is always addressed in company\nwith her husband, enjoys the almost unique distinction of being the\nonly woman outside his own family circle whom Sterne never approaches\nin the language of artificial gallantry, but always in that of simple\nfriendship and respect.[1] Meanwhile, however, the Sentimental\nJourney was advancing at a reasonable rate of speed towards\ncompletion. In July he writes of himself as “now beginning to be truly\nbusy” on it, “the pain and sorrows of this life having retarded its\nprogress.”",
        "[Footnote 1: To this period of Sterne’s life, it may here be remarked,\nis to be assigned the dog-Latin letter (\"and very sad dog-Latin too”)\nso justly animadverted upon by Thackeray, and containing a passage\nof which Madame de Medalle, it is to be charitably hoped, had no\nsuspicion of the meaning. Mr. Fitzgerald, through an oversight in\ntranslation, and understanding Sterne to say that he himself, and\nnot his correspondent, Hall Stevenson, was “quadraginta et plus annos\nnatus,” has referred it to an earlier date. The point, however, is of\nno great importance, as the untranslatable passage in the letter would\nbe little less unseemly in 1754 or 1755 than in 1768, at the beginning\nof which year, since the letter is addressed from London to Hall\nStevenson, then in Yorkshire, it must, in fact, have been written.]",
        "His wife and daughter were about to rejoin him in the autumn, and he\nlooked forward to settling them at a hired house in York before going\nup to town to publish his new volumes. On the 1st of October the two\nladies arrived at York, and the next day the reunited family went on\nto Coxwold. The meeting with the daughter gave Sterne one of the\nfew quite innocent pleasures which he was capable of feeling; and\nhe writes next day to Mr. and Mrs. James in terms of high pride\nand satisfaction of his recovered child. “My girl has returned,\"\nhe writes, in the language of playful affection, “an elegant,\naccomplished little slut. My wife–but I hate,” he adds, with\nremarkable presence of mind, “to praise my wife. ’Tis as much as\ndecency will allow to praise my daughter. I suppose,” he concludes,\n“they will return next summer to France. They leave me in a month to\nreside at York for the winter, and I stay at Coxwold till the 1st\nof January.” This seems to indicate a little longer delay in the\npublication of the Sentimental Journey than he had at first\nintended; for it seems that the book was finished by the end of\nNovember. On the 28th of that month he writes to the Earl of –– (as\nhis daughter’s foolish mysteriousness has headed the letter), to thank\nhim for his letter of inquiry about Yorick, and to say that Yorick\n“has worn out both his spirits and body with the Sentimental\nJourney. ’Tis true that an author must feel himself, or his reader\nwill not” (how mistaken a devotion Sterne showed to this Horatian\ncanon will be noted hereafter), “but I have torn my whole frame into\npieces by my feelings. I believe the brain stands as much in need of\nrecruiting as the body; therefore I shall set out for town the 20th of\nnext month, after having recruited myself at York.” Then he adds the\nstrange observation, “I might, indeed, solace myself with my wife (who\nis come from France), but, in fact, I have long been a sentimental\nbeing, whatever your Lordship may think to the contrary. The world\nhas imagined because I wrote Tristram Shandy that I was myself more\nShandian than I really ever was. ’Tis a good-natured world we live\nin, and we are often painted in divers colours, according to the ideas\neach one frames in his head.” It would, perhaps, have been scarcely\npossible for Sterne to state his essentially unhealthy philosophy of\nlife so concisely as in this naïve passage. The connubial affections\nare here, in all seriousness and good faith apparently, opposed to\nthe sentimental emotions–as the lower to the higher. To indulge the\nformer is to be “Shandian,” that is to say, coarse and carnal; to\ndevote oneself to the latter, or, in other words, to spend one’s\ndays in semi-erotic languishings over the whole female sex\nindiscriminately, is to show spirituality and taste.",
        "Meanwhile, however, that fragile abode of sentimentalism–that frame\nwhich had just been “torn to pieces” by the feelings–was becoming\nweaker than its owner supposed. Much of the exhaustion which Sterne\nhad attributed to the violence of his literary emotions was no doubt\ndue to the rapid decline of bodily powers which, unknown to him, were\nalready within a few months of their final collapse. He did not set\nout for London on the 20th of December, as he had promised himself,\nfor on that day he was only just recovering from “an attack of fever\nand bleeding at the lungs,” which had confined him to his room for\nnearly three weeks. “I am worn down to a shadow,” he writes on the\n23rd, “but as my fever has left me, I set off the latter end of next\nweek with my friend, Mr. Hall, for town.” His home affairs had already\nbeen settled. Early in December it had been arranged that his wife\nand daughter should only remain at York during the winter, and should\nreturn to the Continent in the spring. “Mrs. Sterne’s health,” he\nwrites, “is insupportable in England. She must return to France, and\njustice and humanity forbid me to oppose it.” But separation from his\nwife meant separation from his daughter; it was this, of course, which\nwas the really painful parting, and it is to the credit of Sterne’s\ndisinterestedness of affection for Lydia, that in his then state\nof health he brought himself to consent to her leaving him. But he\nrecognized that it was for the advantage of her prospect of settling\nherself in life that she should go with her mother, who seemed\n“inclined to establish her in France, where she has had many\nadvantageous offers.” Nevertheless “his heart bled,” as he wrote to\nLee, when he thought of parting with his child. “’Twill be like the\nseparation of soul and body, and equal to nothing but what passes at\nthat tremendous moment; and like it in one respect, for she will be in\none kingdom while I am in another.” Thus was this matter settled, and\nby the 1st of January Sterne had arrived in London for the last time,\nwith the two volumes of the Sentimental Journey. He took up his\nquarters at the lodgings in Bond Street (No. 41), which he had\noccupied during his stay in town the previous year, and entered at\nonce upon the arrangements for publication. These occupied two full\nmonths, and on the 27th of February the last work, as it was destined\nto be, of the Rev. Mr. Yorick was issued to the world.",
        "Its success would seem to have been immediate, and was certainly great\nand lasting. In one sense, indeed, it was far greater than had been,\nor than has since been, attained by Tristram Shandy. The compliments\nwhich courteous Frenchmen had paid the author upon his former work,\nand which his simple vanity had swallowed whole and unseasoned,\nwithout the much-needed grain of salt, might, no doubt, have been\nrepeated to him with far greater sincerity as regards the Sentimental\nJourney, had he lived to receive them. Had any Frenchman told him a\nyear or two afterwards that the latter work was “almost as much known\nin Paris as in London, at least among men of condition and learning,\"\nhe would very likely have been telling him no more than the truth. The\nSentimental Journey certainly acquired what Tristram Shandy never\ndid–a European reputation. It has been translated into Italian,\nGerman, Dutch, and even Polish; and into French again and again.\nThe French, indeed, have no doubt whatever of its being Sterne’s\nchef-d’oeuvre; and one has only to compare a French translation of\nit with a rendering of Tristram Shandy into the same language to\nunderstand, and from our neighbours’ point of view even to admit, the\njustice of their preference. The charms of the Journey, its grace,\nwit, and urbanity, are thoroughly congenial to that most graceful of\nlanguages, and reproduce themselves readily enough therein; while,\non the other hand, the fantastic digressions, the elaborate\nmystifications, the farcical interludes of the earlier work, appear\nintolerably awkward and bizzare in their French dress; and, what\nis much more strange, even the point of the double entendres is\nsometimes unaccountably lost. Were it not that the genuine humour of\nTristram Shandy in a great measure evaporates in translation, one\nwould be forced to admit that the work which is the more catholic\nin its appeal to appreciation is the better of the two. But, having\nregard to this disappearance of genuine and unquestionable excellences\nin the process of translation, I see no good reason why those\nEnglishmen–the great majority, I imagine–who prefer Tristram\nShandy to the Sentimental Journey should feel any misgivings as to\nthe soundness of their taste. The humour which goes the deepest\ndown beneath the surface of things is the most likely to become\ninextricably interwoven with those deeper fibres of associations which\nlie at the roots of a language; and it may well happen, therefore,\nthough from the cosmopolitan point of view it is a melancholy\nreflection, that the merit of a book, to those who use the language\nin which it is written, bears a direct ratio to the persistence of its\nrefusal to yield up its charm to men of another tongue.",
        "The favour, however, with which the Sentimental Journey was received\nabroad, and which it still enjoys (the last French translation is\nvery recent), is, as Mr. Fitzgerald says, “worthily merited, if grace,\nnature, true sentiment, and exquisite dramatic power be qualities that\nare to find a welcome. And apart,” he adds, “from these attractions\nit has a unique charm of its own, a flavour, so to speak, a fragrance\nthat belongs to that one book alone. Never was there such a charming\nseries of complete little pictures, which for delicacy seem like the\nseries of medallions done on Sèvres china which we sometimes see in\nold French cabinets.... The figures stand out brightly, and in what\nnumber and variety! Old Calais, with its old inn; M. Dessein, the\nmonk, one of the most artistic figures on literary canvas; the\ncharming French lady whom M. Dessein shut into the carriage with the\ntraveller; the débonnaire French captain, and the English travellers\nreturning, touched in with only a couple of strokes; La Fleur, the\nvalet; the pretty French glove-seller, whose pulse the Sentimental one\nfelt; her husband, who passed through the shop and pulled off his hat\nto Monsieur for the honour he was doing him; the little maid in the\nbookseller’s shop, who put her little present à part; the charming\nGreuze ’grisset,’ who sold him the ruffles; the reduced chevalier\nselling patés; the groups of beggars at Montreuil; the fadeCount de Bissie, who read Shakespeare; and the crowd of minor\ncroquis–postilions, landlords, notaries, soldiers, abbés,\nprécieuses, maids–merely touched, but touched with wonderful art,\nmake up a surprising collection of distinct and graphic characters.”",
