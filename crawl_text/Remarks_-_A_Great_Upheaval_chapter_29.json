        "I have just received the following letter, which I take the liberty of\npublishing, in order that good may come out of it, and that the public\ngenerally may be on the watch:",
        "William Nye, Esq.–",
        "Dear Sir: There has been a great religious upheaval here, and great\nanxiety on the part of our entire congregation, and I write to you, hoping\nthat you may have some suggestions to offer that we could use at this time\nbeneficially.",
        "All the bitter and irreverent remarks of Bob Ingersoll have fallen\nharmlessly upon the minds of our people. The flippant sneers and wicked\nsarcasms of the modern infidel, wise in his own conceit, have alike passed\nover our heads without damage or disaster. These times that have tried\nmen’s souls have only rooted us more firmly in the faith, and united us\nmore closely as brothers and sisters.",
        "We do not care whether the earth was made in two billion years or two\nminutes, so long as it was made and we are satisfied with it. We do not\ncare whether Jonah swallowed the whale or the whale swallowed Jonah. None\nof these things worry us in the least. We do not pin our faith on such\nlittle matters as those, but we try to so live that when we pass on beyond\nthe flood we may have a record to which we may point with pride.",
        "But last Sabbath our entire congregation was visibly moved. People who had\ngrown gray in this church got right up during the service and went out,\nand did not come in again. Brothers who had heard all kinds of infidelity\nand scorned to be moved by it, got up, and kicked the pews, and slammed\nthe doors, and created a young riot.",
        "For many years we have sailed along in the most peaceful faith, and\nthrough joy or sorrow we came to the church together to worship. We have\nlaughed and wept as one family for a quarter of a century, and an humble\ndignity and Christian style of etiquette have pervaded our incomings and\nour outgoings.",
        "That is the reason why a clear case of disorderly conduct in our church\nhas attracted attention and newspaper comment. That is the reason why we\nwant in some public way to have the church set right before we suffer from\nunjust criticism and worldly scorn.",
        "It has been reported that one of the brothers, who is sixty years of age,\nand a model Christian, and a good provider, rose during the first prayer,\nand, waving his plug hat in the air, gave a wild and blood-curdling whoop,\njumped over the back of his pew, and lit out. While this is in a measure\ntrue, it is not accurate. He did do some wild and startling jumping, but\nhe did not jump over the pew. He tried to, but failed. He was too old.",
        "It has also been stated that another brother, who has done more to build\nup the church and society here than any other one man of his size, threw\nhis hymn book across the church, and, with a loud wail that sounded like\nthe word “Gosh!” hissed through clenched teeth, got out through the window\nand went away. This is overdrawn, though there is an element of truth in\nit, and I do not try to deny it.",
        "There were other similar strong evidences of feeling throughout the\ncongregation, none of which had ever been noticed before in this place.\nOur clergyman was amazed and horrified. He tried to ignore the action of\nthe brethren, but when a sister who has grown old in our church, and been\nsuch a model and example of rectitude that all the girls in the county\nwere perfectly discouraged about trying to be anywhere near equal to her;\nwhen she rose with a wild snort, got up on the pew with her feet, and\nswung her parasol in a way that indicated that she would not go home till\nmorning, he paused and briefly wound up the services.",
        "Of course there were other little eccentricities on the part of the\ncongregation, but these were the ones that people have talked about the\nmost, and have done us the most damage abroad.",
        "Now, my desire is that through the medium of the press you will state that\nthis great trouble which has come upon us, by reason of which the ungodly\nhave spoken lightly of us, was not the result of a general tendency to\ndissent from the statements made by our pastor, and therefore an\nexhibition of our disapproval of his doctrines, but that the janitor had\nstarted a light fire in the furnace, and that had revived a large nest of\ncommon, streaked, hot-nosed wasps in the warm air pipe, and when they came\nup through the register and united in the services, there was more or less\nof an ovation.",
        "Sometimes Christianity gets sluggish and comatose, but not under the above\ncircumstances. A man may slumber on softly with his bosom gently rising\nand falling, and his breath coming and going through one corner of his\nmouth like the death rattle of a bath-tub, while the pastor opens out a\nnew box of theological thunders and fills the air full of the sullen roar\nof sulphurous waves, licking the shores of eternity and swallowing up the\ngreat multitudes of the eternally lost; but when one little wasp, with a\nred-hot revelation, goes gently up the leg of that same man’s pantaloons,\nleaving large, hot tracks whenever he stopped and sat down to think it\nover, you will see a sudden awakening and a revival that will attract\nattention.",
        "I wish that you would take this letter, Mr. Nye, and write something from\nit in your own way, for publication, showing how we happened to have more\nzeal than usual in the church last Sabbath, and that it was not directly\nthe result of the sermon which was preached on that day.",
        "Yours, with great respect,",
        "William Lemons.",
