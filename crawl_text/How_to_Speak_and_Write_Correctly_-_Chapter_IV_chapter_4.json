        "FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE",
        "Figures of Speech–Definitions and Examples–Use of Figures",
        "In Figurative Language we employ words in such a way that they differ\nsomewhat from their ordinary signification in commonplace speech and\nconvey our meaning in a more vivid and impressive manner than when we use\nthem in their every-day sense. Figures make speech more effective, they\nbeautify and emphasize it and give to it a relish and piquancy as salt\ndoes to food; besides they add energy and force to expression so that it\nirresistibly compels attention and interest. There are four kinds of\nfigures, viz.: (1) Figures of Orthography which change the spelling of a\nword; (2) Figures of Etymology which change the form of words; (3) Figures\nof Syntax which change the construction of sentences; (4) Figures of\nRhetoric or the art of speaking and writing effectively which change the\nmode of thought.",
        "We shall only consider the last mentioned here as they are the most\nimportant, really giving to language the construction and style which\nmake it a fitting medium for the intercommunication of ideas.",
        "Figures of Rhetoric have been variously classified, some authorities\nextending the list to a useless length. The fact is that any form of\nexpression which conveys thought may be classified as a Figure.",
        "The principal figures as well as the most important and those oftenest\nused are, Simile, Metaphor, Personification, Allegory, Synechdoche,\nMetonymy, Exclamation, Hyperbole, Apostrophe, Vision, Antithesis, Climax,\nEpigram, Interrogation and Irony.",
        "The first four are founded on resemblance, the second six on contiguityand the third five, on contrast.",
        "A Simile (from the Latin similis, like), is the likening of one thing\nto another, a statement of the resemblance of objects, acts, or relations;\nas “In his awful anger he was like the storm-driven waves dashing\nagainst the rock.” A simile makes the principal object plainer and\nimpresses it more forcibly on the mind. “His memory is like wax to\nreceive impressions and like marble to retain them.” This brings out the\nleading idea as to the man’s memory in a very forceful manner. Contrast\nit with the simple statement–\"His memory is good.” Sometimes Simile is\nprostituted to a low and degrading use; as “His face was like a danger\nsignal in a fog storm.” “Her hair was like a furze-bush in bloom.” “He\nwas to his lady love as a poodle to its mistress.” Such burlesque is\nnever permissible. Mere likeness, it should be remembered, does not\nconstitute a simile. For instance there is no simile when one city is\ncompared to another. In order that there may be a rhetorical simile, the\nobjects compared must be of different classes. Avoid the old tritesimiles such as comparing a hero to a lion. Such were played out long\nago. And don’t hunt for farfetched similes. Don’t say–\"Her head was\nglowing as the glorious god of day when he sets in a flambeau of splendor\nbehind the purple-tinted hills of the West.” It is much better to do\nwithout such a simile and simply say–\"She had fiery red hair.”",
        "A Metaphor (from the Greek metapherein, to carry over or transfer),\nis a word used to imply a resemblance but instead of likening one\nobject to another as in the simile we directly substitute the action or\noperation of one for another. If, of a religious man we say,–\"He is as a\ngreat pillar upholding the church,” the expression is a simile, but if\nwe say–\"He is a great pillar upholding the church” it is a metaphor. The\nmetaphor is a bolder and more lively figure than the simile. It is more\nlike a picture and hence, the graphic use of metaphor is called\n“word-painting.” It enables us to give to the most abstract ideas form,\ncolor and life. Our language is full of metaphors, and we very often use\nthem quite unconsciously. For instance, when we speak of the bed of a\nriver, the shoulder of a hill, the foot of a mountain, the hands of\na clock, the key of a situation, we are using metaphors.",
        "Don’t use mixed metaphors, that is, different metaphors in relation to the\nsame subject: “Since it was launched our project has met with much\nopposition, but while its flight has not reached the heights ambitioned, we\nare yet sanguine we shall drive it to success.” Here our project begins as\na ship, then becomes a bird and finally winds up as a horse.",
        "Personification (from the Latin persona, person, and facere, to make)\nis the treating of an inanimate object as if it were animate and is\nprobably the most beautiful and effective of all the figures.",
        "“The mountains sing together, the hills rejoice and clap their\nhands.”",
        "  “Earth felt the wound; and Nature from her seat,\n  Sighing, through all her works, gave signs of woe.”",
        "Personification depends much on a vivid imagination and is adapted\nespecially to poetical composition. It has two distinguishable forms:\n(1) when personality is ascribed to the inanimate as in the foregoing\nexamples, and (2) when some quality of life is attributed to the\ninanimate; as, a raging storm; an angry sea; a whistling wind, etc.",
        "An Allegory (from the Greek allos, other, and agoreuein, to speak),\nis a form of expression in which the words are symbolical of something.\nIt is very closely allied to the metaphor, in fact is a continued metaphor.",
        "Allegory, metaphor and simile have three points in common,–they\nare all founded on resemblance. “Ireland is like a thorn in the side of\nEngland;” this is simile. “Ireland is a thorn in the side of England;\"\nthis is metaphor. “Once a great giant sprang up out of the sea and lived\non an island all by himself. On looking around he discovered a little\ngirl on another small island near by. He thought the little girl could be\nuseful to him in many ways so he determined to make her subservient to\nhis will. He commanded her, but she refused to obey, then he resorted to\nvery harsh measures with the little girl, but she still remained obstinate\nand obdurate. He continued to oppress her until finally she rebelled and\nbecame as a thorn in his side to prick him for his evil attitude towards\nher;” this is an allegory in which the giant plainly represents England\nand the little girl, Ireland; the implication is manifest though no\nmention is made of either country. Strange to say the most perfect allegory\nin the English language was written by an almost illiterate and ignorant\nman, and written too, in a dungeon cell. In the “Pilgrim’s Progress,\"\nBunyan, the itinerant tinker, has given us by far the best allegory ever\npenned. Another good one is “The Faerie Queen” by Edmund Spenser.",
        "Synecdoche (from the Greek, sun with, and ekdexesthai, to receive),\nis a figure of speech which expresses either more or less than it literally\ndenotes. By it we give to an object a name which literally expresses\nsomething more or something less than we intend. Thus: we speak of the\nworld when we mean only a very limited number of the people who compose\nthe world: as, “The world treated him badly.” Here we use the whole for a\npart. But the most common form of this figure is that in which a part is\nused for the whole; as, “I have twenty head of cattle,” “One of his handswas assassinated,” meaning one of his men. “Twenty sail came into the\nharbor,” meaning twenty ships. “This is a fine marble,” meaning a marble\nstatue.",
        "Metonymy (from the Greek meta, change, and onyma, a name) is the\ndesignation of an object by one of its accompaniments, in other words, it\nis a figure by which the name of one object is put for another when the\ntwo are so related that the mention of one readily suggests the other.\nThus when we say of a drunkard–\"He loves the bottle” we do not mean that\nhe loves the glass receptacle, but the liquor that it is supposed to\ncontain. Metonymy, generally speaking, has, three subdivisions: (1) when\nan effect is put for cause or vice versa: as ’Gray hairs should be\nrespected,” meaning old age. “He writes a fine hand,” that is, handwriting.\n(2) when the sign is put for the thing signified; as, “The pen is\nmightier than the sword,” meaning literary power is superior to military\nforce. (3) When the container is put for the thing contained; as “The\nHouse was called to order,” meaning the members in the House.",
        "Exclamation (from the Latin ex, out, and clamare, to cry), is a\nfigure by which the speaker instead of stating a fact, simply utters an\nexpression of surprise or emotion. For instance when he hears some\nharrowing tale of woe or misfortune instead of saying,–\"It is a sad\nstory” he exclaims “What a sad story!”",
        "Exclamation may be defined as the vocal expression of feeling, though it\nis also applied to written forms which are intended to express emotion.\nThus in describing a towering mountain we can write “Heavens, what a\npiece of Nature’s handiwork! how majestic! how sublime! how awe-inspiring\nin its colossal impressiveness!” This figure rather belongs to poetry and\nanimated oratory than to the cold prose of every-day conversation and\nwriting.",
        "Hyperbole (from the Greek hyper, beyond, and ballein, to throw), is\nan exaggerated form of statement and simply consists in representing\nthings to be either greater or less, better or worse than they really\nare. Its object is to make the thought more effective by overstating it.\nHere are some examples:–\"He was so tall his head touched the clouds.\"\n“He was as thin as a poker.” “He was so light that a breath might have\nblown him away.” Most people are liable to overwork this figure. We are\nall more or less given to exaggeration and some of us do not stop there,\nbut proceed onward to falsehood and downright lying. There should be a\nlimit to hyperbole, and in ordinary speech and writing it should be well\nqualified and kept within reasonable bounds.",
        "An Apostrophe (from the Greek apo, from, and strephein, to turn),\nis a direct address to the absent as present, to the inanimate as living,\nor to the abstract as personal. Thus: “O, illustrious Washington! Father\nof our Country! Could you visit us now!”",
        "  “My Country tis of thee–\n   Sweet land of liberty,\n   Of thee I sing.”",
        "“O! Grave, where is thy Victory, O! Death where is thy sting!” This\nfigure is very closely allied to Personification.",
        "Vision (from the Latin videre, to see) consists in treating the past,\nthe future, or the remote as if present in time or place. It is appropriate\nto animated description, as it produces the effect of an ideal presence.\n“The old warrior looks down from the canvas and tells us to be men worthy\nof our sires.”",
        "This figure is much exemplified in the Bible. The book of Revelation is a\nvision of the future. The author who uses the figure most is Carlyle.",
        "An Antithesis (from the Greek anti, against, and tithenai, to set)\nis founded on contrast; it consists in putting two unlike things in such\na position that each will appear more striking by the contrast.",
        "  “Ring out the old, ring in the new,\n   Ring out the false, ring in the true.”",
        "“Let us be friends in peace, but enemies in war.”",
        "Here is a fine antithesis in the description of a steam engine–\"It can\nengrave a seal and crush masses of obdurate metal before it; draw out,\nwithout breaking, a thread as fine as a gossamer; and lift up a ship of\nwar like a bauble in the air; it can embroider muslin and forge anchors;\ncut steel into ribands, and impel loaded vessels against the fury of\nwinds and waves.”",
        "Climax (from the Greek, klimax, a ladder), is an arrangement of\nthoughts and ideas in a series, each part of which gets stronger and more\nimpressive until the last one, which emphasizes the force of all the\npreceding ones. “He risked truth, he risked honor, he risked fame, he\nrisked all that men hold dear,–yea, he risked life itself, and for\nwhat?–for a creature who was not worthy to tie his shoe-latchets when he\nwas his better self.”",
        "Epigram (from the Greek epi, upon, and graphein, to write),\noriginally meant an inscription on a monument, hence it came to signify\nany pointed expression. It now means a statement or any brief saying in\nprose or poetry in which there is an apparent contradiction; as,\n“Conspicuous for his absence.” “Beauty when unadorned is most adorned.\"\n“He was too foolish to commit folly.” “He was so wealthy that he could\nnot spare the money.”",
        "Interrogation (from the Latin interrogatio, a question), is a figure\nof speech in which an assertion is made by asking a question; as, “Does\nGod not show justice to all?” “Is he not doing right in his course?\"\n“What can a man do under the circumstances?”",
        "Irony (from the Greek eironcia, dissimulation) is a form of expression\nin which the opposite is substituted for what is intended, with the end in\nview, that the falsity or absurdity may be apparent; as, “Benedict Arnold\nwas an honorable man.” “A Judas Iscariot never betrays a friend.” “You\ncan always depend upon the word of a liar.”",
        "Irony is cousin germain to ridicule, derision, mockery, satireand sarcasm. Ridicule implies laughter mingled with contempt;\nderision is ridicule from a personal feeling of hostility; mockery is\ninsulting derision; satire is witty mockery; sarcasm is bitter satire\nand irony is disguised satire.",
        "There are many other figures of speech which give piquancy to language\nand play upon words in such a way as to convey a meaning different from\ntheir ordinary signification in common every-day speech and writing. The\ngolden rule for all is to keep them in harmony with the character and\npurpose of speech and composition.",
