        "We now come to the studio of S. Marco, where the two friends, who had\ndreamed together as boys, and worked together as youths, now laboured\njointly as men, bringing to light some of the finest works of art that\nremain to us. During these three years Albertinelli’s star seems merged\nin that of his senior, his hand is to be recognised in the lower parts\nof a few altarpieces; but it is always difficult to distinguish the two\nstyles.",
        "It was a very busy atelier, for they had many patrons. Bugiardini was\nstill Mariotto’s head assistant, and Fra Paolino, and one or two other\nmonks, worked under Fra Bartolommeo, besides pupils of both, among whom\nwere Gabriele Rustici and Benedetto Cianfanini.",
        "The studio was on the part of the convent between the cloister and Via\ndel Maglio, [Footnote: Padre Marchese, Memorie, vol. ii. p. 69.]\nand we can quite picture its interior. There stands the lay figure on\nwhich Fra Bartolommeo draped the garments that take such majestic folds\nin his works; [Footnote:  Fra Bartolommeo was the inventor of the\njointed lay figure.] there are several casts and models in different\nparts of the room; grand cartoons in charcoal hang on the walls, like\nthose we see to this day in the Uffizi and Belle Arti. So many of these\nmasterly sketches are the Frate’s and so few are Mariotto’s that we may\npresume the former was in most instances the designer. And to what\nperfection he carried design! Not a figure was drawn except its lines\nharmonised with the geometric rhythm in the artist’s mind. His groups\nfall by nature into kaleidoscopic figures of circles, triangles,\nellipses, crosses, &c. Not a cartoon was sketched in which the lights\nand shadows were not as gradated and finished as a painting, although\nthey were merely drawn with charcoal. The following was the method of\nwork in the “bottega.” The panels were prepared with a coating of\nplaster of Paris, over which, when dry, a coat of under colour, ground\nin oil, was passed. The preparing of the panels fell to the work of one\nof the monk scholars, Fra Andrea.[Footnote: The books of the convent\nhave a note of payment to Fra Bartolommeo for 20th March, 1512, “per\nparte di lavoro di Fra Andrea converse per mettere d’oro, et ingessare\nalle tavole nella bottega in diversi lavori” (Padre Marchese,\nMemorie, lib. ii. chap. in. p. 70).] Then the master made his\nsketch in white, or “sgraffito” (i.e. graven on the plaster), as in the\narchitectural lines of the pictures of patron saints in the Uffizi, and\nthe Marriage of S. Catherine in the Pitti Palace; he also put in\nthe shadows in monochrome. But the assistants, who were skilled\nartists, were called to put broad level tints of local colour on the\nbuildings, &c., the master himself finishing the faces. No doubt\nAlbertinelli was often deputed to the study of the lay figure and its\ndrapery. Where he assisted, the monogram, a cross with two rings and\nthe joint names, marked the work, as en a panel of 1510 in Vienna, and\nanother at Geneva.",
        "Fra Bartolommeo only imitated Leonardo in his intense force and soft\ngradations; the general thinness of colour is opposed to his system. He\nfollowed him, however, in his method of painting his shadows with the\nbrush, instead of “hatching” them; he used the same yellowish ground,\nand “sfumato,” [Footnote: Eastlake’s Materials for a History of Oil\nPainting, vol. ii. chap. iv.] i.e. the imperceptible softening of the\ntransition in half-lights and shadows; it was effected by glazes, and is\nnot adapted to a thin substance. The great mistake in Fra Bartolommeo’s\nsystem was the preparing his paintings like cartoons, and using asphaltum\nor lamp-black for outlines and shadows; this in process of time destroys\nthe super-colour, and gives a general blackness to the painting.",
        "The same kind of talk went on here as in modern studios. When the\nframe-maker came, Fra Bartolommeo would be vexed to see how much of his\nwork was hidden beneath the massive cornice, and would vow to dispense\nwith frames altogether, which he did in his S. Sebastian and\nS. Mark, by painting an architectural niche round the subject\nlike a carving in relief.",
        "The first work begun at the convent studio was the picture for Father\nDalgano of Venice, the subject of which is the Eternal Father in\nHeaven, surrounded by seraphs and angels. Perhaps in this we have\nthe source of the motive of Albertinelli’s Annunciation. The\ncolouring is more brilliant than any of the Frate’s works before his\nvisit to Venice. Vasari says that in this picture Giorgione himself\ncould not have surpassed him in brilliancy. The saints, although nearly\nlevel with the ground, are given celestial rank by the cherubs and\nclouds below them. Fra Bartolommeo was dissatisfied with his angels,\nwhich seemed merely lovely children, and seeking other forms, he\nthought to picture them better under shapes which at a distance seem\nonly clouds, but nearer are full of angels’ faces, as in the S.\nBernard. But this idea, not having aesthetic beauty, was also\nabandoned. [Footnote: Padre Marchese, I Puristi ed Accademici.]",
        "The monks of S. Pietro at Murano did not hasten to claim their picture,\nbut sent two friars to negotiate about the price; they failed to agree,\nand the work is now in the Church of S. Romano in Lucca.",
        "Lucca has another exquisite picture of the same year in the Cathedral\nof S. Martino, a Madonna and Child–a lovely ideal of joyful\ninfancy–beneath a veil suspended above her head by two angels. S. John\nBaptist and S. Stephen support this airy composition like pillars,\ntheir figures showing in strong relief against the dark shades; the\nwhole picture is intensely soft, and yet the outlines are perfectly\nclear. This is valued at sixty ducats in the Libri di San Marco.",
        "Next followed the Virgin and Child with four Saints, in S.\nMarco, which is so fine that it has been taken for a Raphael, although,\nowing to the use of lamp-black, it has now become very much darkened.",
        "The Holy Family which he painted for Filippo di Averardo\nSalviati, and which is now in Earl Cowper’s collection at Panshanger,\nis an almost Raphaelesque work, and attains the greatest excellence in\nart. The composition is his favourite triangle, touched in with the\nflowing lines of the mother seated on the ground with the two children\nbefore her. S. Joseph is in the background. The greatest softness of\nflesh tints must have been perceptible when new, for, “in spite of the\nabrasions produced by time, the delicate tones brought out by\ntransparent glazes fused one over another are apparent.” The landscape\nwith an echo subject of the flight into Egypt is thought by Crowe and\nCavalcaselle to be by Albertinelli.",
        "In 1510 the partners had a large order from Giuliano da Gagliano, who,\non the 2nd November, 1510, and 14th January, 1511, paid, in two rates,\nthe sum of 154 ducats. The picture, which is Fra Bartolommeo’s own\npainting, unfortunately cannot be traced.",
        "In 1511 a long list of works are enumerated–a Nativity, valued\ntwo ducats, a Christ bearing the Cross, and an Annunciation, sold\nto the Gonfaloniere for six ducats–pictures which are dispersed in\nEngland, Pavia, &c.; but the masterpiece of the time is the Marriage of\nS. Catherine, now in the Louvre. The Florentine government bought it for\n300 ducats in 1512, to present to Jacques Hurault, Bishop of Autun, who\ncame to Florence as envoy of Louis XII. He left it to his cathedral at\nAutun, from whence, at the Revolution, it passed to the Louvre. [Footnote:\nPadre Marchese, Memorie, lib. iii. ch. iv. p. 77. Crowe and\nCavalcaselle, History of Painting, vol. iii. chap. xiii. p. 452.]\nBefore it was sent away, Fra Bartolommeo made a replica of it, which is\nnow in the Pitti Palace. There is his favourite canopy supported by\nangels; in this case they are beautifully foreshortened. The Virgin is\nseated on a pedestal, holding by one arm an exquisitely moulded child\nJesus of about four years old, who is espousing S. Catherine of Siena,\nkneeling at His feet on the left. A semicircle of saints group on each\nside of the Virgin, and two angels, with musical instruments, are at her\nfeet; the upturned face of one is exquisitely foreshortened. The S. George\nin armour is a powerful figure; and in S. Bartholomew, on the left, is\nthe same grand feeling which he afterwards brought to perfection in S.\nMark. The grace of the Virgin’s figure is not to be surpassed; if\nRaphael’s Madonnas have more sentiment, this has more dignified grace.\nHe has remembered Leonardo’s precept, “that the two figures of a group\nshould not look the same way\"; the contrast of the flowing lines in\nthese two forms is very lovely. The same contrast of lines, and yet\nbalance of form, is carried out in the two S. Catherines who form the\npyramid on each side of her, and in the varied characters of the\nencircling group of saints. The deleterious use of lampblack has\nspoiled the colouring; it, moreover, hangs in a bad light at the Pitti\nPalace.",
        "The original subject at the Louvre differs only in a few particulars\nfrom this–the Virgin’s hand is on the child’s head instead of his arm,\nand there are trifling differences in the grouping of the saints, the\nsemicircle being more rigidly kept. In this the flesh is thin and\nuncracked, seeming imbedded in the surrounding colours; the lake\ndraperies are laid so thinly on the light ground, that the sketch can\nbe seen through the colour. [Footnote: Eastlake, Materials for a\nHistory of Oil Painting, vol. ii. chap. iv. Crowe and Cavalcaselle\nspeak of the two paintings as unconnected with each other, and mention\nthe Pitti one as having unaccountably returned there after having been\ngiven to some bishop. Is it not possible that the gift to a bishop\nrefers to the painting in the Louvre, and that the other is the replica\nspoken of by Vasari, vol. ii. p. 452?]",
        "There is a fine painting in the church of S. Caterina of Pisa, in the\nchapel of the Mastiani family, Michele Mastiani having given the\ncommission, and paid thirty ducats, in October, 1511. It represents the\nMadonna and Child seated on a base; the action is quiet and yet\nvivacious; she is supported on each side by S. Peter and S. Paul,\nfigures as large as life, and even more noble than the ones in Rome.\nThe colouring has been much injured by a fire in the seventeenth\ncentury, but is robust and harmonious. It is dated 1511.",
        "On the 26th of November, 1510, Fra Bartolommeo had a commission from\nPier Soderini, then Gonfaloniere, to paint a picture for the Council\nHall. This was an unfortunate order; for Michelangelo and Leonardo da\nVinci had both been commissioned, neither of them finishing the works.\nFra Bartolommeo’s forms the third uncompleted painting; it exists still\nin the form of a half prepared picture, the design being only shadowed\nin monochrome, and this in spite of the payment on account of 100 gold\nducats in October, 1513. [Footnote: See Padre Marchese, Memorie,\ndocumenti 5 and 6, vol ii. p. 603.] The reason of this is difficult to\nassign, but it might lie in the fact that in 1512 Pier Soderini was\ndeposed and exiled by Giuliano de’ Medici, who assumed the government.\nAnother reason may have been the failure of Fra Bartolommeo’s health\nafter his journey to Rome.",
        "In 1512 Santi Pagnini came back from Siena as prior of S. Marco, and he\nhaving no love for Albertinelli, and perhaps a too jealous affection\nfor the artist Monk, caused the partnership to be dissolved, much to\nMariotto’s sorrow. The stock, of which a full list is given by Padre\nMarchese, was divided, each taking the pictures in which they had most\nto do. The properties–amongst which were the lay figures, easels,\ncasts, sketches, blocks of porphyry to grind colours on, &c. [Footnote:\nPadre Marchese, vol. ii. pp. 184, 185.]–were to be left for Fra\nBartolommeo’s use till his death, when they were to be divided between\nhis heirs and Albertinelli.",
        "Mariotto returned disheartened to paint in his solitary studio. A\nspecimen of this period is the Adam and Eve, now at Castle\nHoward, which is said to have been sketched in by Fra Bartolommeo. Eve\nstands beneath the serpent-entwined tree, hesitating between the\ndemon’s temptations and Adam’s persuasions; the feeling and action are\nperfectly expressed, the landscape is minute, but has plenty of\natmosphere and good colouring. In the same collection is a Sacrifice\nof Abraham, in his best style. The drawing of the father,\nreluctantly holding his knife to the throat of the boy, is extremely\ntrue. Munich possesses a fine Annunciation. Characteristic\nsaints support the composition on each side, the nude S. Sebastian\nbeing a markworthy study; an angel at his side presents the palm of\nmartyrdom. The picture has suffered much from bad cleaning.",
        "In March, 1513, Albertinelli was commissioned by the Medici to paint\ntheir arms, in honour of Leo X.’s elevation to the papacy. He made a\nfine allegorical circular picture, in which the arms were supported by\nthe figures of Faith, Hope, and Charity.",
