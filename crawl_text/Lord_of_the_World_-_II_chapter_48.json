        "It would be about three o’clock in the morning that the priest awoke in\nhis little mud-walled room next to that of the Holy Father’s, and heard\na footstep coming up the stairs. Last evening he had left his master as\nusual beginning to open the pile of letters arrived from Cardinal\nCorkran, and himself had gone straight to his bed and slept. He lay now\na moment or two, still drowsy, listening to the pad of feet, and an\ninstant later sat up abruptly, for a deliberate tap had sounded on the\ndoor. Again it came; he sprang out of bed in his long night-tunic, drew\nit up hastily in his girdle, went to the door and opened it.",
        "The Pope was standing there, with a little lamp in one hand, for the\ndawn had scarcely yet begun, and a paper in the other.",
        "“I beg your pardon, Father; but there is a message I must have sent at\nonce to his Eminence.”",
        "Together they went out through the Pope’s room, the priest, still\nhalf-blind with sleep, passed up the stairs, and emerged into the clear\ncold air of the upper roof. The Pope blew out His lamp, and set it on\nthe parapet.",
        "“You will be cold, Father; fetch your cloak.”",
        "“And you, Holiness?”",
        "The other made a little gesture of denial, and went across to the tiny\ntemporary shed where the wireless telegraphic instrument stood.",
        "“Fetch your cloak, Father,” He said again over His shoulder. “I will\nring up meanwhile.”",
        "When the priest came back three minutes later, in his slippers and\ncloak, carrying another cloak also for his master, the Pope was still\nseated at the table. He did not even move His head as the other came up,\nbut once more pressed on the lever that, communicating with the\ntwelve-foot pole that rose through the pent-house overhead, shot out the\nquivering energy through the eighty miles of glimmering air that lay\nbetween Nazareth and Damascus.",
        "This simple priest had scarcely even by now become accustomed to this\nextraordinary device invented a century ago and perfected through all\nthose years to this precise exactness–that device by which with the\nhelp of a stick, a bundle of wires, and a box of wheels, something, at\nlast established to be at the root of all matter, if not at the very\nroot of physical life, spoke across the spaces of the world to a tiny\nreceiver tuned by a hair’s breadth to the vibration with which it was\nset in relations.",
        "The air was surprisingly cold, considering the heat that had preceded\nand would follow it, and the priest shivered a little as he stood clear\nof the roof, and stared, now at the motionless figure in the chair\nbefore him, now at the vast vault of the sky passing, even as he looked,\nfrom a cold colourless luminosity to a tender tint of yellow, as far\naway beyond Thabor and Moab the dawn began to deepen. From the village\nhalf-a-mile away arose the crowing of a cock, thin and brazen as a\ntrumpet; a dog barked once and was silent again; and then, on a sudden,\na single stroke upon a bell hung in the roof recalled him in an instant,\nand told him that his work was to begin.",
        "The Pope pressed the lever again at the sound, twice, and then, after a\npause, once more–waited a moment for an answer, and then when it came,\nrose and signed to the priest to take his place.",
        "The Syrian sat down, handing the extra cloak to his master, and waited\nuntil the other had settled Himself in a chair set in such a position at\nthe side of the table that the face of each was visible to the other.\nThen he waited, with his brown fingers poised above the row of keys,\nlooking at the other’s face as He arranged himself to speak. That face,\nhe thought, looking out from the hood, seemed paler than ever in this\ncold light of dawn; the black arched eyebrows accentuated this, and even\nthe steady lips, preparing to speak, seemed white and bloodless. He had\nHis paper in His hand, and His eyes were fixed upon this.",
        "“Make sure it is the Cardinal,” he said abruptly.",
        "The priest tapped off an enquiry, and, with moving lips, raid off the\nprinted message, as like magic it precipitated itself on to the tall\nwhite sheet of paper that faced him.",
        "“It is his Eminence, Holiness,” he said softly. “He is alone at the\ninstrument.”",
        "“Very well. Now then; begin.”",
        "“We have received your Eminence’s letter, and have noted the news.... It\nshould have been forwarded by telegraphy–why was that not done?”",
        "The voice paused, and the priest who had snapped off the message, more\nquickly than a man could write it, read aloud the answer.",
        "“’I did not understand that it was urgent. I thought it was but one\nmore assault. I had intended to communicate more so soon as I heard\nmore.\"’",
        "“Of course it was urgent,” came the voice again in the deliberate\nintonation that was used between these two in the case of messages for\ntransmission. “Remember that all news of this kind is always urgent.”",
        "“’I will remember,’ read the priest. “ `I regret my mistake.’”",
        "“You tell us,” went on the Pope, His eyes still downcast on the paper,\n“that this measure is decided upon; you name only three authorities.\nGive me, now, all the authorities you have, if you have more.”",
        "There was a moment’s pause. Then the priest began to read off the names.",
        "“Besides the three Cardinals whose names I sent, the Archbishops of\nThibet, Cairo, Calcutta and Sydney have all asked if the news was true,\nand for directions if it is true; besides others whose names I can\ncommunicate if I may leave the table for a moment.’”",
        "“Do so,” said the Pope.",
        "Again there was a pause. Then once more the names began.",
        "“’The Bishops of Bukarest, the Marquesas Islands and Newfoundland. The\nFranciscans in Japan, the Crutched Friars in Morocco, the Archbishops of\nManitoba and Portland, and the Cardinal-Archbisbop of Pekin. I have\ndespatched two members of Christ Crucified to England.’”",
        "“Tell us when the news first arrived, and how.”",
        "“’I was called up to the instrument yesterday evening at about twenty\no’clock. The Archbishop of Sydney was asking, through our station at\nBombay, whether the news was true. I replied I had heard nothing of it.\nWithin ten minutes four more inquiries had come to the same effect; and\nthree minutes later Cardinal Ruspoli sent the positive news from Turin.\nThis was accompanied by a similar message from Father Petrovski in\nMoscow. Then–- ’”",
        "“Stop. Why did not Cardinal Dolgorovski communicate it?”",
        "“’He did communicate it three hours later.’”",
        "“Why not at once?”",
        "“’His Eminence had not heard it.’”",
        "“Find out at what hour the news reached Moscow–not now, but within the\nday.”",
        "“’I will.’”",
        "“Go on, then.”",
        "“’Cardinal Malpas communicated it within five minutes of Cardinal\nRuspoli, and the rest of the inquiries arrived before midnight. China\nreported it at twenty-three.’”",
        "“Then when do you suppose the news was made public?”",
        "“’It was decided first at the secret London conference, yesterday, at\nabout sixteen o’clock by our time. The Plenipotentiaries appear to have\nsigned it at that hour. After that it was communicated to the world. It\nwas published here half an hour past midnight.’”",
        "“Then Felsenburgh was in London?”",
        "“’I am not yet sure. Cardinal Malpas tells me that Felsenburgh gave his\nprovisional consent on the previous day.’”",
        "“Very good. That is all you know, then?”",
        "“’I was called up an hour ago by Cardinal Ruspoli again. He tells me\nthat he fears a riot in Florence; it will be the first of many\nrevolutions, he says.’”",
        "“Does he ask for anything?”",
        "“’Only for directions.’”",
        "“Tell him that we send him the Apostolic Benediction, and will forward\ndirections within the course of two hours. Select twelve members of the\nOrder for immediate service.”",
        "“’I will.’”",
        "“Communicate that message also, as soon as we have finished, to all the\nSacred College, and bid them communicate it with all discretion to all\nmetropolitans and bishops, that priests and people may know that We bear\nthem in our heart.”",
        "“’I will, Holiness.’”",
        "“Tell them, finally, that We had foreseen this long ago; that We commend\nthem to the Eternal Father without Whose Providence no sparrow falls to\nthe ground. Bid them be quiet and confident; to do nothing, save confess\ntheir faith when they are questioned. All other directions shall be\nissued to their pastors immediately!”",
        "“’I will, Holiness.’”",
        "There was again a pause.",
        "The Pope had been speaking with the utmost tranquillity as one in a\ndream. His eyes were downcast upon the paper, His whole body as\nmotionless as an image. Yet to the priest who listened, despatching the\nLatin messages, and reading aloud the replies, it seemed, although so\nlittle intelligible news had reached him, as if something very strange\nand great was impending. There was the sense of a peculiar strain in the\nair, and although he drew no deductions from the fact that apparently\nthe whole Catholic world was in frantic communication with Damascus, yet\nhe remembered his meditations of the evening before as he had waited for\nthe messenger. It seemed as if the powers of this world were\ncontemplating one more step–with its nature he was not greatly\nconcerned.",
        "The Pope spoke again in His natural voice.",
        "“Father,” he said, “what I am about to say now is as if I told it in\nconfession. You understand?–Very well. Now begin.”",
        "Then again the intonation began.",
        "“Eminence. We shall say mass of the Holy Ghost in one hour from now. At\nthe end of that time, you will cause that all the Sacred College shall\nbe in touch with yourself, and waiting for our commands. This new\ndecision is unlike any that have preceded it. Surely you understand\nthat now. Two or three plans are in our mind, yet We are not sure yet\nwhich it is that our Lord intends. After mass We shall communicate to\nyou that which He shall show Us to be according to His Will. We beg of\nyou to say mass also, immediately, for Our intention. Whatever must be\ndone must be done quickly. The matter of Cardinal Dolgorovski you may\nleave until later. But we wish to hear the result of your inquiries,\nespecially in London, before mid-day. Benedicat te Omnipotens Deus,\nPater et Filius et Spiritus Sanctus.“",
        "“’Amen!’” murmured the priest, reading it from the sheet.",
