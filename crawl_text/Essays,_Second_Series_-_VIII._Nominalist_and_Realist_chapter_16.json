        "I CANNOT often enough say that a man is only a\nrelative and representative nature. Each is a hint\nof the truth, but far enough from being that truth\nwhich yet he quite newly and inevitably suggests\nto us. If I seek it in him I shall not find it.\nCould any man conduct into me the pure stream of\nthat which he pretends to be! Long afterwards I\nfind that quality elsewhere which he promised me.\nThe genius of the Platonists is intoxicating to the\nstudent, yet how few particulars of it can I detach\nfrom all their books.  The man momentarily stands\nfor the thought, but will not bear examination; and\na society of men will cursorily represent well enough\na certain quality and culture, for example, chivalry\nor beauty of manners; but separate them and there is\nno gentleman and no lady in the group. The least hint\nsets us on the pursuit of a character which no man\nrealizes. We have such exorbitant eyes that on seeing\nthe smallest arc we complete the curve, and when the\ncurtain is lifted from the diagram which it seemed to\nveil, we are vexed to find that no more was drawn than\njust that fragment of an arc which we first beheld. We\nare greatly too liberal in our construction of each\nother’s faculty and promise. Exactly what the parties\nhave already done they shall do again; but that which\nwe inferred from their nature and inception, they will\nnot do. That is in nature, but not in them. That happens\nin the world, which we often witness in a public debate.\nEach of the speakers expresses himself imperfectly; no\none of them hears much that another says, such is the\npreoccupation of mind of each; and the audience, who\nhave only to hear and not to speak, judge very wisely\nand superiorly how wrongheaded and unskilful is each of\nthe debaters to his own affair. Great men or men of great\ngifts you shall easily find, but symmetrical men never.\nWhen I meet a pure intellectual force or a generosity of\naffection, I believe here then is man; and am presently\nmortified by the discovery that this individual is no\nmore available to his own or to the general ends than\nhis companions; because the power which drew my respect\nis not supported by the total symphony of his talents.\nAll persons exist to society by some shining trait of\nbeauty or utility which they have. We borrow the\nproportions of the man from that one fine feature, and\nfinish the portrait symmetrically; which is false, for\nthe rest of his body is small or deformed. I observe a\nperson who makes a good public appearance, and conclude\nthence the perfection of his private character, on which\nthis is based; but he has no private character. He is a\ngraceful cloak or lay-figure for holidays. All our poets,\nheroes, and saints, fail utterly in some one or in many\nparts to satisfy our idea, fail to draw our spontaneous\ninterest, and so leave us without any hope of realization\nbut in our own future. Our exaggeration of all fine\ncharacters arises from the fact that we identify each in\nturn with the soul. But there are no such men as we fable;\nno Jesus, nor Pericles, nor Caesar, nor Angelo, nor\nWashington, such as we have made. We consecrate a great\ndeal of nonsense because it was allowed by great men.\nThere is none without his foible. I verily believe if an\nangel should come to chant the chorus of the moral law,\nhe would eat too much gingerbread, or take liberties with\nprivate letters, or do some precious atrocity. It is bad\nenough that our geniuses cannot do anything useful, but\nit is worse that no man is fit for society who has fine\ntraits. He is admired at a distance, but he cannot come\nnear without appearing a cripple. The men of fine parts\nprotect themselves by solitude, or by courtesy, or by\nsatire, or by an acid worldly manner, each concealing as\nhe best can his incapacity for useful association, but\nthey want either love or self-reliance.",
        "Our native love of reality joins with this experience\nto teach us a little reserve, and to dissuade a too\nsudden surrender to the brilliant qualities of persons.\nYoung people admire talents or particular excellences;\nas we grow older we value total powers and effects, as\nthe impression, the quality, the spirit of men and\nthings. The genius is all. The man,—it is his system:\nwe do not try a solitary word or act, but his habit.\nThe acts which you praise, I praise not, since they are\ndepartures from his faith, and are mere compliances.\nThe magnetism which arranges tribes and races in one\npolarity is alone to be respected; the men are steel-\nfilings. Yet we unjustly select a particle, and say,\n’O steel-filing number one! what heart-drawings I feel\nto thee! what prodigious virtues are these of thine! how\nconstitutional to thee, and incommunicable.’ Whilst we\nspeak the loadstone is withdrawn; down falls our filing\nin a heap with the rest, and we continue our mummery to\nthe wretched shaving. Let us go for universals; for the\nmagnetism, not for the needles. Human life and its\npersons are poor empirical pretensions. A personal\ninfluence is an ignis fatuus. If they say it is great,\nit is great; if they say it is small, it is small; you\nsee it, and you see it not, by turns; it borrows all its\nsize from the momentary estimation of the speakers: the\nWill-of-the-wisp vanishes if you go too near, vanishes\nif you go too far, and only blazes at one angle.  Who\ncan tell if Washington be a great man or no? Who can\ntell if Franklin be? Yes, or any but the twelve, or six,\nor three great gods of fame? And they too loom and fade\nbefore the eternal.",
        "We are amphibious creatures, weaponed for two\nelements, having two sets of faculties, the particular\nand the catholic. We adjust our instrument for general\nobservation, and sweep the heavens as easily as we\npick out a single figure in the terrestrial landscape.\nWe are practically skilful in detecting elements for\nwhich we have no place in our theory, and no name. Thus\nwe are very sensible of an atmospheric influence in men\nand in bodies of men, not accounted for in an arithmetical\naddition of all their measurable properties. There is a\ngenius of a nation, which is not to be found in the\nnumerical citizens, but which characterizes the society.\nEngland, strong, punctual, practical, well-spoken England\nI should not find if I should go to the island to seek it.\nIn the parliament, in the play-house, at dinner-tables, I\nmight see a great number of rich, ignorant, book-read,\nconventional, proud men,—many old women,—and not anywhere\nthe Englishman who made the good speeches, combined the\naccurate engines, and did the bold and nervous deeds. It\nis even worse in America, where, from the intellectual\nquickness of the race, the genius of the country is more\nsplendid in its promise and more slight in its performance.\nWebster cannot do the work of Webster. We conceive distinctly\nenough the French, the Spanish, the German genius, and it\nis not the less real that perhaps we should not meet in\neither of those nations a single individual who corresponded\nwith the type. We infer the spirit of the nation in great\nmeasure from the language, which is a sort of monument to\nwhich each forcible individual in a course of many hundred\nyears has contributed a stone. And, universally, a good\nexample of this social force is the veracity of language,\nwhich cannot be debauched. In any controversy concerning\nmorals, an appeal may be made with safety to the sentiments\nwhich the language of the people expresses. Proverbs, words,\nand grammar-inflections convey the public sense with more\npurity and precision than the wisest individual.",
        "In the famous dispute with the Nominalists, the\nRealists had a good deal of reason. General ideas\nare essences. They are our gods: they round and\nennoble the most partial and sordid way of living.\nOur proclivity to details cannot quite degrade our\nlife and divest it of poetry. The day-laborer is\nreckoned as standing at the foot of the social scale,\nyet he is saturated with the laws of the world. His\nmeasures are the hours; morning and night, solstice\nand equinox, geometry, astronomy and all the lovely\naccidents of nature play through his mind. Money,\nwhich represents the prose of life, and which is\nhardly spoken of in parlors without an apology, is,\nin its effects and laws, as beautiful as roses.\nProperty keeps the accounts of the world, and is\nalways moral. The property will be found where the\nlabor, the wisdom, and the virtue have been in nations,\nin classes, and (the whole life-time considered, with\nthe compensations) in the individual also. How wise\nthe world appears, when the laws and usages of nations\nare largely detailed, and the completeness of the\nmunicipal system is considered! Nothing is left out.\nIf you go into the markets and the custom-houses, the\ninsurers’ and notaries’ offices, the offices of sealers\nof weights and measures, of inspection of provisions,—\nit will appear as if one man had made it all. Wherever\nyou go, a wit like your own has been before you, and\nhas realized its thought. The Eleusinian mysteries, the\nEgyptian architecture, the Indian astronomy, the Greek\nsculpture, show that there always were seeing and knowing\nmen in the planet. The world is full of masonic ties, of\nguilds, of secret and public legions of honor; that of\nscholars, for example; and that of gentlemen, fraternizing\nwith the upper class of every country and every culture.",
        "I am very much struck in literature by the appearance\nthat one person wrote all the books; as if the editor\nof a journal planted his body of reporters in different\nparts of the field of action, and relieved some by\nothers from time to time; but there is such equality\nand identity both of judgment and point of view in\nthe narrative that it is plainly the work of one all-\nseeing, all-hearing gentleman. I looked into Pope’s\nOdyssey yesterday: it is as correct and elegant after\nour canon of to-day as if it were newly written. The\nmodernness of all good books seems to give me an\nexistence as wide as man. What is well done I feel as\nif I did; what is ill done I reck not of. Shakspeare’s\npassages of passion (for example, in Lear and Hamlet)\nare in the very dialect of the present year. I am\nfaithful again to the whole over the members in my\nuse of books. I find the most pleasure in reading a\nbook in a manner least flattering to the author. I\nread Proclus, and sometimes Plato, as I might read a\ndictionary, for a mechanical help to the fancy and\nthe imagination. I read for the lustres, as if one\nshould use a fine picture in a chromatic experiment,\nfor its rich colors. ’Tis not Proclus, but a piece\nof nature and fate that I explore. It is a greater\njoy to see the author’s author, than himself. A higher\npleasure of the same kind I found lately at a concert,\nwhere I went to hear Handel’s Messiah. As the master\noverpowered the littleness and incapableness of the\nperformers and made them conductors of his electricity,\nso it was easy to observe what efforts nature was\nmaking, through so many hoarse, wooden, and imperfect\npersons, to produce beautiful voices, fluid and soul-\nguided men and women. The genius of nature was paramount\nat the oratorio.",
        "This preference of the genius to the parts is the\nsecret of that deification of art, which is found\nin all superior minds. Art, in the artist, is\nproportion, or a habitual respect to the whole by\nan eye loving beauty in details. And the wonder and\ncharm of it is the sanity in insanity which it denotes.\nProportion is almost impossible to human beings. There\nis no one who does not exaggerate. In conversation,\nmen are encumbered with personality, and talk too much.\nIn modern sculpture, picture, and poetry, the beauty is\nmiscellaneous; the artist works here and there and at\nall points, adding and adding, instead of unfolding\nthe unit of his thought. Beautiful details we must have,\nor no artist; but they must be means and never other.\nThe eye must not lose sight for a moment of the purpose.\nLively boys write to their ear and eye, and the cool\nreader finds nothing but sweet jingles in it. When they\ngrow older, they respect the argument.",
        "We obey the same intellectual integrity when we\nstudy in exceptions the law of the world. Anomalous\nfacts, as the never quite obsolete rumors of magic\nand demonology, and the new allegations of phrenologists\nand neurologists, are of ideal use. They are good\nindications. Homoeopathy is insignificant as an art\nof healing, but of great value as criticism on the\nhygeia or medical practice of the time. So with\nMesmerism, Swedenborgism, Fourierism, and the Millennial\nChurch; they are poor pretensions enough, but good\ncriticism on the science, philosophy, and preaching\nof the day. For these abnormal insights of the adepts\nought to be normal, and things of course.",
        "All things show us that on every side we are very\nnear to the best. It seems not worth while to execute\nwith too much pains some one intellectual, or\naesthetical, or civil feat, when presently the dream\nwill scatter, and we shall burst into universal power.\nThe reason of idleness and of crime is the deferring\nof our hopes. Whilst we are waiting we beguile the\ntime with jokes, with sleep, with eating, and with\ncrimes.",
        "Thus we settle it in our cool libraries, that all\nthe agents with which we deal are subalterns, which\nwe can well afford to let pass, and life will be\nsimpler when we live at the centre and flout the\nsurfaces. I wish to speak with all respect of\npersons, but sometimes I must pinch myself to keep\nawake and preserve the due decorum. They melt so\nfast into each other that they are like grass and\ntrees, and it needs an effort to treat them as\nindividuals. Though the uninspired man certainly\nfinds persons a conveniency in household matters,\nthe divine man does not respect them; he sees them\nas a rack of clouds, or a fleet of ripples which\nthe wind drives over the surface of the water. But\nthis is flat rebellion. Nature will not be Buddhist:\nshe resents generalizing, and insults the philosopher\nin every moment with a million of fresh particulars.\nIt is all idle talking: as much as a man is a whole,\nso is he also a part; and it were partial not to\nsee it. What you say in your pompous distribution\nonly distributes you into your class and section. You\nhave not got rid of parts by denying them, but are the\nmore partial. You are one thing, but Nature is one\nthing and the other thing, in the same moment. She will\nnot remain orbed in a thought, but rushes into persons;\nand when each person, inflamed to a fury of personality,\nwould conquer all things to his poor crotchet, she\nraises up against him another person, and by many persons\nincarnates again a sort of whole. She will have all. Nick\nBottom cannot play all the parts, work it how he may;\nthere will be somebody else, and the world will be round.\nEverything must have its flower or effort at the beautiful,\ncoarser or finer according to its stuff. They relieve and\nrecommend each other, and the sanity of society is a\nbalance of a thousand insanities. She punishes\nabstractionists, and will only forgive an induction which\nis rare and casual. We like to come to a height of land\nand see the landscape, just as we value a general remark\nin conversation. But it is not the intention of Nature\nthat we should live by general views.  We fetch fire and\nwater, run about all day among the shops and markets, and\nget our clothes and shoes made and mended, and are the\nvictims of these details; and once in a fortnight we arrive\nperhaps at a rational moment. If we were not thus infatuated,\nif we saw the real from hour to hour, we should not be here\nto write and to read, but should have been burned or frozen\nlong ago. She would never get anything done, if she suffered\nadmirable Crichtons and universal geniuses. She loves better\na wheelwright who dreams all night of wheels, and a groom\nwho is part of his horse; for she is full of work, and these\nare her hands. As the frugal farmer takes care that his\ncattle shall eat down the rowen, and swine shall eat the\nwaste of his house, and poultry shall pick the crumbs,—so\nour economical mother dispatches a new genius and habit of\nmind into every district and condition of existence, plants\nan eye wherever a new ray of light can fall, and gathering\nup into some man every property in the universe, establishes\nthousandfold occult mutual attractions among her offspring,\nthat all this wash and waste of power may be imparted and\nexchanged.",
        "Great dangers undoubtedly accrue from this incarnation\nand distribution of the godhead, and hence Nature has\nher maligners, as if she were Circe; and Alphonso of\nCastille fancied he could have given useful advice.\nBut she does not go unprovided; she has hellebore at\nthe bottom of the cup. Solitude would ripen a plentiful\ncrop of despots. The recluse thinks of men as having\nhis manner, or as not having his manner; and as having\ndegrees of it, more and less. But when he comes into a\npublic assembly he sees that men have very different\nmanners from his own, and in their way admirable. In\nhis childhood and youth he has had many checks and\ncensures, and thinks modestly enough of his own endowment.\nWhen afterwards he comes to unfold it in propitious\ncircumstance, it seems the only talent; he is delighted\nwith his success, and accounts himself already the fellow\nof the great. But he goes into a mob, into a banking\nhouse, into a mechanic’s shop, into a mill, into a\nlaboratory, into a ship, into a camp, and in each new\nplace he is no better than an idiot; other talents take\nplace, and rule the hour. The rotation which whirls every\nleaf and pebble to the meridian, reaches to every gift of\nman, and we all take turns at the top.",
        "For Nature, who abhors mannerism, has set her heart\non breaking up all styles and tricks, and it is so\nmuch easier to do what one has done before than to\ndo a new thing, that there is a perpetual tendency\nto a set mode. In every conversation, even the highest,\nthere is a certain trick, which may be soon learned\nby an acute person and then that particular style\ncontinued indefinitely. Each man too is a tyrant in\ntendency, because he would impose his idea on others;\nand their trick is their natural defence. Jesus would\nabsorb the race; but Tom Paine or the coarsest\nblasphemer helps humanity by resisting this exuberance\nof power. Hence the immense benefit of party in politics,\nas it reveals faults of character in a chief, which the\nintellectual force of the persons, with ordinary\nopportunity and not hurled into aphelion by hatred,\ncould not have seen. Since we are all so stupid, what\nbenefit that there should be two stupidities! It is\nlike that brute advantage so essential to astronomy,\nof having the diameter of the earth’s orbit for a base\nof its triangles. Democracy is morose, and runs to\nanarchy, but in the State and in the schools it is\nindispensable to resist the consolidation of all men\ninto a few men. If John was perfect, why are you and\nI alive? As long as any man exists, there is some need\nof him; let him fight for his own. A new poet has\nappeared; a new character approached us; why should we\nrefuse to eat bread until we have found his regiment\nand section in our old army-files? Why not a new man?\nHere is a new enterprise of Brook Farm, of Skeneateles,\nof Northampton: why so impatient to baptize them Essenes,\nor Port-Royalists, or Shakers, or by any known and effete\nname? Let it be a new way of living. Why have only two\nor three ways of life, and not thousands? Every man is\nwanted, and no man is wanted much.  We came this time\nfor condiments, not for corn. We want the great genius\nonly for joy; for one star more in our constellation,\nfor one tree more in our grove. But he thinks we wish\nto belong to him, as he wishes to occupy us. He greatly\nmistakes us. I think I have done well if I have acquired\na new word from a good author; and my business with him\nis to find my own, though it were only to melt him down\ninto an epithet or an image for daily use:—",
        "To embroil the confusion, and make it impossible\nto arrive at any general statement,—when we have\ninsisted on the imperfection of individuals, our\naffections and our experience urge that every\nindividual is entitled to honor, and a very generous\ntreatment is sure to be repaid. A recluse sees only\ntwo or three persons, and allows them all their room;\nthey spread themselves at large. The statesman looks\nat many, and compares the few habitually with others,\nand these look less. Yet are they not entitled to this\ngenerosity of reception? and is not munificence the\nmeans of insight? For though gamesters say that the\ncards beat all the players, though they were never so\nskilful, yet in the contest we are now considering,\nthe players are also the game, and share the power of\nthe cards. If you criticise a fine genius, the odds\nare that you are out of your reckoning, and instead\nof the poet, are censuring your own caricature of\nhim. For there is somewhat spheral and infinite in\nevery man, especially in every genius, which, if you\ncan come very near him, sports with all your\nlimitations. For rightly every man is a channel through\nwhich heaven floweth, and whilst I fancied I was\ncriticising him, I was censuring or rather terminating\nmy own soul. After taxing Goethe as a courtier,\nartificial, unbelieving, worldly,—I took up this book\nof Helena, and found him an Indian of the wilderness,\na piece of pure nature like an apple or an oak, large\nas morning or night, and virtuous as a brier-rose.",
        "But care is taken that the whole tune shall be\nplayed. If we were not kept among surfaces, every\nthing would be large and universal; now the excluded\nattributes burst in on us with the more brightness\nthat they have been excluded. “Your turn now, my\nturn next,” is the rule of the game. The universality\nbeing hindered in its primary form, comes in the\nsecondary form of all sides; the points come in\nsuccession to the meridian, and by the speed of\nrotation a new whole is formed. Nature keeps herself\nwhole and her representation complete in the experience\nof each mind. She suffers no seat to be vacant in her\ncollege. It is the secret of the world that all things\nsubsist and do not die but only retire a little from\nsight and afterwards return again. Whatever does not\nconcern us is concealed from us. As soon as a person\nis no longer related to our present well-being, he is\nconcealed, or dies, as we say. Really, all things and\npersons are related to us, but according to our nature\nthey act on us not at once but in succession, and we\nare made aware of their presence one at a time. All\npersons, all things which we have known, are here\npresent, and many more than we see; the world is full.\nAs the ancient said, the world is a plenum or solid;\nand if we saw all things that really surround us we\nshould be imprisoned and unable to move. For though\nnothing is impassable to the soul, but all things are\npervious to it and like highways, yet this is only\nwhilst the soul does not see them. As soon as the soul\nsees any object, it stops before that object.  Therefore,\nthe divine Providence which keeps the universe open in\nevery direction to the soul, conceals all the furniture\nand all the persons that do not concern a particular\nsoul, from the senses of that individual. Through\nsolidest eternal things the man finds his road as if\nthey did not subsist, and does not once suspect their\nbeing. As soon as he needs a new object, suddenly he\nbeholds it, and no longer attempts to pass through it,\nbut takes another way. When he has exhausted for the\ntime the nourishment to be drawn from any one person\nor thing, that object is withdrawn from his observation,\nand though still in his immediate neighborhood, he does\nnot suspect its presence. Nothing is dead: men feign\nthemselves dead, and endure mock funerals and mournful\nobituaries, and there they stand looking out of the\nwindow, sound and well, in some new and strange disguise.\nJesus is not dead; he is very well alive: nor John, nor\nPaul, nor Mahomet, nor Aristotle; at times we believe\nwe have seen them all, and could easily tell the names\nunder which they go.",
        "If we cannot make voluntary and conscious steps\nin the admirable science of universals, let us see\nthe parts wisely, and infer the genius of nature\nfrom the best particulars with a becoming charity.\nWhat is best in each kind is an index of what\nshould be the average of that thing. Love shows me\nthe opulence of nature, by disclosing to me in my\nfriend a hidden wealth, and I infer an equal depth\nof good in every other direction. It is commonly\nsaid by farmers that a good pear or apple costs no\nmore time or pains to rear than a poor one; so I\nwould have no work of art, no speech, or action, or\nthought, or friend, but the best.",
        "The end and the means, the gamester and the game,\n—life is made up of the intermixture and reaction\nof these two amicable powers, whose marriage appears\nbeforehand monstrous, as each denies and tends to\nabolish the other. We must reconcile the contradictions\nas we can, but their discord and their concord\nintroduce wild absurdities into our thinking and speech.\nNo sentence will hold the whole truth, and the only way\nin which we can be just, is by giving ourselves the lie;\nSpeech is better than silence; silence is better than\nspeech;—All things are in contact; every atom has a\nsphere of repulsion;—Things are, and are not, at the\nsame time;—and the like. All the universe over, there\nis but one thing, this old Two-Face, creator-creature,\nmind-matter, right-wrong, of which any proposition may\nbe affirmed or denied. Very fitly therefore I assert\nthat every man is a partialist, that nature secures him\nas an instrument by self-conceit, preventing the\ntendencies to religion and science; and now further\nassert, that, each man’s genius being nearly and\naffectionately explored, he is justified in his\nindividuality, as his nature is found to be immense;\nand now I add that every man is a universalist also,\nand, as our earth, whilst it spins on its own axis,\nspins all the time around the sun through the celestial\nspaces, so the least of its rational children, the most\ndedicated to his private affair, works out, though as it\nwere under a disguise, the universal problem. We fancy\nmen are individuals; so are pumpkins; but every pumpkin\nin the field goes through every point of pumpkin history.\nThe rabid democrat, as soon as he is senator and rich man,\nhas ripened beyond possibility of sincere radicalism, and\nunless he can resist the sun, he must be conservative the\nremainder of his days. Lord Eldon said in his old age that\n“if he were to begin life again, he would be damned but he\nwould begin as agitator.”",
        "We hide this universality if we can, but it appears\nat all points. We are as ungrateful as children.\nThere is nothing we cherish and strive to draw to us\nbut in some hour we turn and rend it. We keep a running\nfire of sarcasm at ignorance and the life of the senses;\nthen goes by, perchance, a fair girl, a piece of life,\ngay and happy, and making the commonest offices beautiful\nby the energy and heart with which she does them; and\nseeing this we admire and love her and them, and say,\n’Lo! a genuine creature of the fair earth, not dissipated\nor too early ripened by books, philosophy, religion,\nsociety, or care!’ insinuating a treachery and contempt\nfor all we had so long loved and wrought in ourselves\nand others.",
        "If we could have any security against moods! If\nthe profoundest prophet could be holden to his\nwords, and the hearer who is ready to sell all\nand join the crusade could have any certificate\nthat tomorrow his prophet shall not unsay his\ntestimony! But the Truth sits veiled there on the\nBench, and never interposes an adamantine syllable;\nand the most sincere and revolutionary doctrine,\nput as if the ark of God were carried forward some\nfurlongs, and planted there for the succor of the\nworld, shall in a few weeks be coldly set aside by\nthe same speaker, as morbid; “I thought I was right,\nbut I was not,\"—and the same immeasurable credulity\ndemanded for new audacities. If we were not of all\nopinions! if we did not in any moment shift the\nplatform on which we stand, and look and speak from\nanother! if there could be any regulation, any ’one-\nhour-rule,’ that a man should never leave his point\nof view without sound of trumpet. I am always insincere,\nas always knowing there are other moods.",
        "How sincere and confidential we can be, saying\nall that lies in the mind, and yet go away feeling\nthat all is yet unsaid, from the incapacity of the\nparties to know each other, although they use the\nsame words! My companion assumes to know my mood\nand habit of thought, and we go on from explanation\nto explanation until all is said which words can,\nand we leave matters just as they were at first,\nbecause of that vicious assumption. Is it that every\nman believes every other to be an incurable partialist,\nand himself a universalist? I talked yesterday with a\npair of philosophers; I endeavored to show my good\nmen that I love everything by turns and nothing long;\nthat I loved the centre, but doated on the superficies;\nthat I loved man, if men seemed to me mice and rats;\nthat I revered saints, but woke up glad that the old\npagan world stood its ground and died hard; that I was\nglad of men of every gift and nobility, but would not\nlive in their arms. Could they but once understand\nthat I loved to know that they existed, and heartily\nwished them God-speed, yet, out of my poverty of life\nand thought, had no word or welcome for them when they\ncame to see me, and could well consent to their living\nin Oregon, for any claim I felt on them,—it would be\na great satisfaction.",
