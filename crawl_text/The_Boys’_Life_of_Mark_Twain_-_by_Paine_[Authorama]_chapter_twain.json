        "This is the story of a boy, born in the humblest surroundings, reared\nalmost without schooling, and amid benighted conditions such as to-day\nhave no existence, yet who lived to achieve a world-wide fame; to attain\nhonorary degrees from the greatest universities of America and Europe; to\nbe sought by statesmen and kings; to be loved and honored by all men in\nall lands, and mourned by them when he died.  It is the story of one of\nthe world’s very great men–the story of Mark Twain.",
        "A long time ago, back in the early years of another century, a family\nnamed Clemens moved from eastern Tennessee to eastern Missouri–from a\nsmall, unheard-of place called Pall Mall, on Wolf River, to an equally\nsmall and unknown place called Florida, on a tiny river named the Salt.",
        "That was a far journey, in those days, for railway trains in 1835 had not\nreached the South and West, and John Clemens and his family traveled in\nan old two-horse barouche, with two extra riding-horses, on one of which\nrode the eldest child, Orion Clemens, a boy of ten, and on the other\nJennie, a slave girl.",
        "In the carriage with the parents were three other children–Pamela and\nMargaret, aged eight and five, and little Benjamin, three years old.  The\ntime was spring, the period of the Old South, and, while these youngsters\ndid not realize that they were passing through a sort of Golden Age, they\nmust have enjoyed the weeks of leisurely journeying toward what was then\nthe Far West–the Promised Land.",
        "The Clemens fortunes had been poor in Tennessee.  John Marshall Clemens,\nthe father, was a lawyer, a man of education; but he was a dreamer, too,\nfull of schemes that usually failed.  Born in Virginia, he had grown up\nin Kentucky, and married there Jane Lampton, of Columbia, a descendant of\nthe English Lamptons and the belle of her region.  They had left Kentucky\nfor Tennessee, drifting from one small town to another that was always\nsmaller, and with dwindling law-practice John Clemens in time had been\nobliged to open a poor little store, which in the end had failed to pay.\nJennie was the last of several slaves he had inherited from his Virginia\nancestors.  Besides Jennie, his fortune now consisted of the horses and\nbarouche, a very limited supply of money, and a large, unsalable tract of\neast Tennessee land, which John Clemens dreamed would one day bring his\nchildren fortune.",
        "Readers of the “Gilded Age” will remember the journey of the Hawkins\nfamily from the “Knobs” of Tennessee to Missouri and the important part\nin that story played by the Tennessee land.  Mark Twain wrote those\nchapters, and while they are not history, but fiction, they are based\nupon fact, and the picture they present of family hardship and struggle\nis not overdrawn.  The character of Colonel Sellers, who gave the\nHawkinses a grand welcome to the new home, was also real.  In life he was\nJames Lampton, cousin to Mrs. Clemens, a gentle and radiant merchant of\ndreams, who believed himself heir to an English earldom and was always on\nthe verge of colossal fortune.  With others of the Lampton kin, he was\nalready settled in Missouri and had written back glowing accounts; though\nperhaps not more glowing than those which had come from another relative,\nJohn Quarles, brother-in-law to Mrs. Clemens, a jovial, whole-hearted\noptimist, well-loved by all who knew him.",
        "It was a June evening when the Clemens family, with the barouche and the\ntwo outriders, finally arrived in Florida, and the place, no doubt,\nseemed attractive enough then, however it may have appeared later.  It\nwas the end of a long journey; relatives gathered with fond welcome;\nprospects seemed bright.  Already John Quarles had opened a general store\nin the little town.  Florida, he said, was certain to become a city.\nSalt River would be made navigable with a series of locks and dams.  He\noffered John Clemens a partnership in his business.",
        "Quarles, for that time and place, was a rich man.  Besides his store he\nhad a farm and thirty slaves.  His brother-in-law’s funds, or lack of\nthem, did not matter.  The two had married sisters.  That was capital\nenough for his hearty nature.  So, almost on the moment of arrival in the\nnew land, John Clemens once more found himself established in trade.",
        "The next thing was to find a home.  There were twenty-one houses in\nFlorida, and none of them large.  The one selected by John and Jane\nClemens had two main rooms and a lean-to kitchen–a small place and\nlowly–the kind of a place that so often has seen the beginning of\nexalted lives.  Christianity began with a babe in a manger; Shakespeare\nfirst saw the light in a cottage at Stratford; Lincoln entered the world\nby way of a leaky cabin in Kentucky, and into the narrow limits of the\nClemens home in Florida, on a bleak autumn day–November 30, 1835–there\nwas born one who under the name of Mark Twain would live to cheer and\ncomfort a tired world.",
        "The name Mark Twain had not been thought of then, and probably no one\nprophesied favorably for the new-comer, who was small and feeble, and not\nover-welcome in that crowded household.  They named him Samuel, after his\npaternal grandfather, and added Langhorne for an old friend–a goodly\nburden for so frail a wayfarer.  But more appropriately they called him\n\"Little Sam,” or “Sammy,” which clung to him through the years of his\ndelicate childhood.",
        "It seems a curious childhood, as we think of it now.  Missouri was a\nslave State–Little Sam’s companions were as often black as white.  All\nthe children of that time and locality had negroes for playmates, and\nwere cared for by them.  They were fond of their black companions and\nwould have felt lost without them.  The negro children knew all the best\nways of doing things–how to work charms and spells, the best way to cure\nwarts and heal stone-bruises, and to make it rain, and to find lost\nmoney.  They knew what signs meant, and dreams, and how to keep off\nhoodoo; and all negroes, old and young, knew any number of weird tales.",
        "John Clemens must have prospered during the early years of his Florida\nresidence, for he added another slave to his household–Uncle Ned, a man\nof all work–and he built a somewhat larger house, in one room of which,\nthe kitchen, was a big fireplace.  There was a wide hearth and always\nplenty of wood, and here after supper the children would gather, with\nJennie and Uncle Ned, and the latter would tell hair-lifting tales of\n\"ha’nts,” and lonely roads, and witch-work that would make his hearers\nshiver with terror and delight, and look furtively over their shoulders\ntoward the dark window-panes and the hovering shadows on the walls.\nPerhaps it was not the healthiest entertainment, but it was the kind to\ncultivate an imagination that would one day produce “Tom Sawyer” and\n\"Huck Finn.”",
        "True, Little Sam was very young at this period, but even a little chap of\ntwo or three would understand most of that fireside talk, and get\nimpressions more vivid than if the understanding were complete.  He was\nbarely four when this earliest chapter of his life came to a close.",
        "John Clemens had not remained satisfied with Florida and his undertakings\nthere.  The town had not kept its promises.  It failed to grow, and the\nlock-and-dam scheme that would make Salt River navigable fell through.\nThen one of the children, Margaret, a black-eyed, rosy little girl of\nnine, suddenly died.  This was in August, 1839.  A month or two later the\nsaddened family abandoned their Florida home and moved in wagons, with\ntheir household furnishings, to Hannibal, a Mississippi River town,\nthirty miles away.  There was only one girl left now, Pamela, twelve\nyears old, but there was another boy, baby Henry, three years younger\nthan Little Sam–four boys in all.",
        "Hannibal was a town with prospects and considerable trade.  It was\nslumbrous, being a slave town, but it was not dead.  John Clemens\nbelieved it a promising place for business, and opened a small general\nstore with Orion Clemens, now fifteen, a studious, dreamy lad, for clerk.",
        "The little city was also an attractive place of residence.  Mark Twain\nremembered it as “the white town drowsing in the sunshine of a summer\nmorning, .  .  .  the great Mississippi, the magnificent Mississippi,\nrolling its mile-wide tide along, ....  the dense forest away on the\nother side.”",
        "The “white town” was built against green hills, and abutting the river\nwere bluffs–Holliday’s Hill and Lover’s Leap.  A distance below the town\nwas a cave–a wonderful cave, as every reader of Tom Sawyer knows–while\nout in the river, toward the Illinois shore, was the delectable island\nthat was one day to be the meeting-place of Tom’s pirate band, and later\nto become the hiding-place of Huck and Nigger Jim.",
        "The river itself was full of interest.  It was the highway to the outside\nworld.  Rafts drifted by; smartly painted steamboats panted up and down,\ntouching to exchange traffic and travelers, a never-ceasing wonder to\nthose simple shut-in dwellers whom the telegraph and railway had not yet\nreached.  That Hannibal was a pleasant place of residence we may believe,\nand what an attractive place for a boy to grow up in!",
        "Little Sam, however, was not yet ready to enjoy the island and the cave.\nHe was still delicate–the least promising of the family.  He was queer\nand fanciful, and rather silent.  He walked in his sleep and was often\nfound in the middle of the night, fretting with the cold, in some dark\ncorner.  Once he heard that a neighbor’s children had the measles, and,\nbeing very anxious to catch the complaint, slipped over to the house and\ncrept into bed with an infected playmate.  Some days later, Little Sam’s\nrelatives gathered about his bed to see him die.  He confessed, long\nafter, that the scene gratified him.  However, he survived, and fell into\nthe habit of running away, usually in the direction of the river.",
        "“You gave me more uneasiness than any child I had,” his mother once said\nto him, in her old age.",
        "“I suppose you were afraid I wouldn’t live,” he suggested.",
        "She looked at him with the keen humor which had been her legacy to him.\n\"No, afraid you would,” she said.  Which was only her joke, for she had\nthe tenderest of hearts, and, like all mothers, had a weakness for the\nchild that demanded most of her mother’s care.  It was chiefly on his\naccount that she returned each year to Florida to spend the summer on\nJohn Quarles’s farm.",
        "If Uncle John Quarles’s farm was just an ordinary Missouri farm, and his\nslaves just average negroes, they certainly never seemed so to Little\nSam.  There was a kind of glory about everything that belonged to Uncle\nJohn, and it was not all imagination, for some of the spirit of that\njovial, kindly hearted man could hardly fail to radiate from his\nbelongings.",
        "The farm was a large one for that locality, and the farm-house was a big\ndouble log building–that is, two buildings with a roofed-over passage\nbetween, where in summer the lavish Southern meals were served, brought\nin on huge dishes by the negroes, and left for each one to help himself.\nFried chicken, roast pig, turkeys, ducks, geese, venison just killed,\nsquirrels, rabbits, partridges, pheasants, prairie-chickens, green corn,\nwatermelon–a little boy who did not die on that bill of fare would be\nlikely to get well on it, and to Little Sam the farm proved a life-saver.",
        "It was, in fact, a heavenly place for a little boy.  In the corner of the\nyard there were hickory and black-walnut trees, and just over the fence\nthe hill sloped past barns and cribs to a brook, a rare place to wade,\nthough there were forbidden pools.  Cousin Tabitha Quarles, called\n\"Puss,” his own age, was Little Sam’s playmate, and a slave girl, Mary,\nwho, being six years older, was supposed to keep them out of mischief.\nThere were swings in the big, shady pasture, where Mary swung her charges\nand ran under them until their feet touched the branches.  All the woods\nwere full of squirrels and birds and blooming flowers; all the meadows\nwere gay with clover and butterflies, and musical with singing\ngrasshoppers and calling larks; the fence-rows were full of wild\nblackberries; there were apples and peaches in the orchard, and plenty of\nmelons ripening in the corn.  Certainly it was a glorious place!",
        "Little Sam got into trouble once with the watermelons.  One of them had\nnot ripened quite enough when he ate several slices of it.  Very soon\nafter he was seized with such terrible cramps that some of the household\ndid not think he could live.",
        "But his mother said: “Sammy will pull through.  He was not born to die\nthat way.”  Which was a true prophecy.  Sammy’s slender constitution\nwithstood the strain.  It was similarly tested more than once during\nthose early years.  He was regarded as a curious child.  At times dreamy\nand silent, again wild-headed and noisy, with sudden impulses that sent\nhim capering and swinging his arms into the wind until he would fall with\nshrieks and spasms of laughter and madly roll over and over in the grass.\nIt is not remembered that any one prophesied very well for his future at\nsuch times.",
        "The negro quarters on Uncle John’s farm were especially fascinating.  In\none cabin lived a bedridden old woman whom the children looked upon with\nawe.  She was said to be a thousand years old, and to have talked with\nMoses.  She had lost her health in the desert, coming out of Egypt.  She\nhad seen Pharaoh drown, and the fright had caused the bald spot on her\nhead.  She could ward off witches and dissolve spells.",
        "Uncle Dan’l was another favorite, a kind-hearted, gentle soul, who long\nafter, as Nigger Jim in the Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn tales, would\nwin world-wide love and sympathy.",
        "Through that far-off, warm, golden summer-time Little Sam romped and\ndreamed and grew.  He would return each summer to the farm during those\nearly years.  It would become a beautiful memory.  His mother generally\nkept him there until the late fall, when the chilly evenings made them\ngather around the wide, blazing fireplace.  Sixty years later he wrote:",
        "“I can see the room yet with perfect clearness.  I can see all\n     its belongings, all its details; the family-room of the house, with\n     the trundle-bed in one corner and the spinning-wheel in another–a\n     wheel whose rising and falling wail, heard from a distance, was the\n     mournfulest of all sounds to me and made me homesick and low-\n     spirited and filled my atmosphere with the wandering spirits of the\n     dead; the vast fireplace, piled high with flaming logs from whose\n     ends a sugary sap bubbled out but did not go to waste, for we\n     scraped it off and ate it; .  .  .  the lazy cat spread out on the\n     rough hearthstones, the drowsy dogs braced against the jambs,\n     blinking; my aunt in one chimney-corner, and my uncle in the other,\n     smoking his corn-cob pipe.”",
        "It is hard not to tell more of the farm, for the boy who was one day\ngoing to write of Tom and Huck and the rest learned there so many things\nthat Tom and Huck would need to know.",
        "But he must have “book-learning,” too, Jane Clemens said.  On his return\nto Hannibal that first summer, she decided that Little Sam was ready for\nschool.  He was five years old and regarded as a “stirring child.”",
        "“He drives me crazy with his didoes when he’s in the house,” his mother\ndeclared, “and when he’s out of it I’m expecting every minute that some\none will bring him home half dead.”",
        "Mark Twain used to say that he had had nine narrow escapes from drowning,\nand it was at this early age that he was brought home one afternoon in a\nlimp state, having been pulled from a deep hole in Bear Creek by a slave\ngirl.",
        "When he was restored, his mother said: “I guess there wasn’t much danger.\nPeople born to be hanged are safe in water.”",
        "Mark Twain’s mother was the original of Aunt Polly in the story of Tom\nSawyer, an outspoken, keen-witted, charitable woman, whom it was good to\nknow.  She had a heart full of pity, especially for dumb creatures.  She\nrefused to kill even flies, and punished the cat for catching mice.  She\nwould drown young kittens when necessary, but warmed the water for the\npurpose.  She could be strict, however, with her children, if occasion\nrequired, and recognized their faults.",
        "Little Sam was inclined to elaborate largely on fact.  A neighbor once\nsaid to her: “You don’t believe anything that child says, I hope.”",
        "“Oh yes, I know his average.  I discount him ninety per cent.  The rest\nis pure gold.”",
        "She declared she was willing to pay somebody to take him off her hands\nfor a part of each day and try to teach him “manners.”  A certain Mrs. E.\nHorr was selected for the purpose.",
        "Mrs. Horr’s school on Main Street, Hannibal, was of the old-fashioned\nkind.  There were pupils of all ages, and everything was taught up to the\nthird reader and long division.  Pupils who cared to go beyond those\nstudies went to a Mr. Cross, on the hill, facing what is now the public\nsquare.  Mrs. Horr received twenty-five cents a week for each pupil, and\nthe rules of conduct were read daily.  After the rules came the A-B-C\nclass, whose recitation was a hand-to-hand struggle, requiring no study-\ntime.",
        "The rules of conduct that first day interested Little Sam.  He wondered\nhow nearly he could come to breaking them and escape.  He experimented\nduring the forenoon, and received a warning.  Another experiment would\nmean correction.  He did not expect to be caught again; but when he least\nexpected it he was startled by a command to go out and bring a stick for\nhis own punishment.",
        "This was rather dazing.  It was sudden, and, then, he did not know much\nabout choosing sticks for such a purpose.  Jane Clemens had commonly used\nher hand.  A second command was needed to start him in the right\ndirection, and he was still dazed when he got outside.  He had the\nforests of Missouri to select from, but choice was not easy.  Everything\nlooked too big and competent.  Even the smallest switch had a wiry look.\nAcross the way was a cooper’s shop.  There were shavings outside, and one\nhad blown across just in front of him.  He picked it up, and, gravely\nentering the room, handed it to Mrs. Horr.  So far as known, it is the\nfirst example of that humor which would one day make Little Sam famous\nbefore all the world.",
        "It was a failure in this instance.  Mrs. Horr’s comic side may have\nprompted forgiveness, but discipline must be maintained.",
        "“Samuel Langhorne Clemens,” she said (he had never heard it all strung\ntogether in that ominous way), “I am ashamed of you!  Jimmy Dunlap, go\nand bring a switch for Sammy.”  And the switch that Jimmy Dunlap brought\nwas of a kind to give Little Sam a permanent distaste for school.  He\ntold his mother at noon that he did not care for education; that he did\nnot wish to be a great man; that his desire was to be an Indian and scalp\nsuch persons as Mrs. Horr.  In her heart Jane Clemens was sorry for him,\nbut she openly said she was glad there was somebody who could take him in\nhand.",
        "Little Sam went back to school, but he never learned to like it.  A\nschool was ruled with a rod in those days, and of the smaller boys Little\nSam’s back was sore as often as the next.  When the days of early summer\ncame again, when from his desk he could see the sunshine lighting the\nsoft green of Holliday’s Hill, with the glint of the river and the purple\ndistance beyond, it seemed to him that to be shut up with a Webster\nspelling-book and a cross teacher was more than human nature could bear.\nThere still exists a yellow slip of paper upon which, in neat, old-\nfashioned penmanship is written:",
        "     MISS PAMELA CLEMENS",
        "     Has won the love of her teacher and schoolmates by her amiable\n     deportment and faithful application to her various studies.",
        "     E. HORR, Teacher.",
        "Thus we learn that Little Sam’s sister, eight years older than himself,\nattended the same school, and that she was a good pupil.  If any such\nreward of merit was ever conferred on Little Sam, it has failed to come\nto light.  If he won the love of his teacher and playmates, it was\nprobably for other reasons.",
        "Yet he must have learned somehow, for he could read, presently, and was a\ngood speller for his age.",
        "On their arrival in Hannibal, the Clemens family had moved into a part of\nwhat was then the Pavey Hotel.  They could not have remained there long,\nfor they moved twice within the next few years, and again in 1844 into a\nnew house which Judge Clemens, as he was generally called, had built\non Hill Street–a house still standing, and known to-day as the Mark\nTwain home.",
        "John Clemens had met varying fortunes in Hannibal.  Neither commerce nor\nthe practice of law had paid.  The office of justice of the peace, to\nwhich he was elected, returned a fair income, but his business losses\nfinally obliged him to sell Jennie, the slave girl.  Somewhat later his\nbusiness failure was complete.  He surrendered everything to his\ncreditors, even to his cow and household furniture, and relied upon his\nlaw practice and justice fees.  However, he seems to have kept the\nTennessee land, possibly because no one thought it worth taking.  There\nhad been offers for it earlier, but none that its owner would accept.  It\nappears to have been not even considered by his creditors, though his own\nfaith in it never died.",
        "The struggle for a time was very bitter.  Orion Clemens, now seventeen,\nhad learned the printer’s trade and assisted the family with his wages.\nMrs. Clemens took a few boarders.  In the midst of this time of hardship\nlittle Benjamin Clemens died.  He was ten years old.  It was the darkest\nhour.",
        "Then conditions slowly improved.  There was more law practice and better\njustice fees.  By 1844 Judge Clemens was able to build the house\nmentioned above–a plain, cheap house, but a shelter and a home.  Sam\nClemens–he was hardly “Little Sam” any more–was at this time nine years\nold.  His boyhood had begun.",
        "Heretofore he had been just a child–wild and mischievous, often\nexasperating, but still a child–a delicate little lad to be worried\nover, mothered, or spanked and put to bed.  Now at nine he had acquired\nhealth, with a sturdy ability to look out for himself, as boys in such a\ncommunity will.  “Sam,” as they now called him, was “grown up” at nine\nand wise for his years.  Not that he was old in spirit or manner–he was\nnever that, even to his death–but he had learned a great number of\nthings, many of them of a kind not taught at school.",
        "He had learned a good deal of natural history and botany–the habits of\nplants, insects, and animals.  Mark Twain’s books bear evidence of this\nearly study.  His plants, bugs, and animals never do the wrong things.\nHe was learning a good deal about men, and this was often less pleasant\nknowledge.  Once Little Sam–he was still Little Sam then–saw an old man\nshot down on Main Street at noon day.  He saw them carry him home, lay\nhim on the bed, and spread on his breast an open family Bible, which\nlooked as heavy as an anvil.  He thought if he could only drag that great\nburden away the poor old dying man would not breathe so heavily.",
        "He saw a young emigrant stabbed with a bowie-knife by a drunken comrade,\nand two young men try to kill their uncle, one holding him while the\nother snapped repeatedly an Allen revolver, which failed to go off.  Then\nthere was the drunken rowdy who proposed to raid the “Welshman’s” house,\none sultry, threatening evening–he saw that, too.  With a boon\ncompanion, John Briggs, he followed at a safe distance behind.  A widow\nwith her one daughter lived there.  They stood in the shadow of the dark\nporch; the man had paused at the gate to revile them.  The boys heard the\nmother’s voice warning the intruder that she had a loaded gun and would\nkill him if he stayed where he was.  He replied with a tirade, and she\nwarned him that she would count ten–that if he remained a second longer\nshe would fire.  She began slowly and counted up to five, the man\nlaughing and jeering.  At six he grew silent, but he did not go.  She\ncounted on: seven, eight, nine–",
        "The boys, watching from the dark roadside, felt their hearts stop.  There\nwas a long pause, then the final count, followed a second later by a gush\nof flame.  The man dropped, his breast riddled.  At the same instant the\nthunder-storm that had been gathering broke loose.  The boys fled wildly,\nbelieving that Satan himself had arrived to claim the lost soul.",
        "That was a day and locality of violent impulse and sudden action.\nHappenings such as these were not infrequent in a town like Hannibal.\nAnd there were events connected with slavery.  Sam once saw a slave\nstruck down and killed with a piece of slag, for a trifling offense.  He\nsaw an Abolitionist attacked by a mob that would have lynched him had not\na Methodist minister defended him on a plea that he must be crazy.  He\ndid not remember in later years that he had ever seen a slave auction,\nbut he added:",
        "“I am suspicious that it was because the thing was a commonplace\n     spectacle and not an uncommon or impressive one.  I do vividly\n     remember seeing a dozen black men and women, chained together, lying\n     in a group on the pavement, waiting shipment to a Southern slave-\n     market.  They had the saddest faces I ever saw.”",
        "Readers of Mark Twain’s books–especially the stories of Huck and Tom,\nwill hardly be surprised to hear of these early happenings that formed so\nlarge a portion of the author’s early education.  Sam, however, did not\nregard them as education–not at the time.  They got into his dreams.  He\nset them down as warnings, or punishments, intended to give him a taste\nfor a better life.  He felt that it was his conscience that made such\nthings torture him.  That was his mother’s idea, and he had a high\nrespect for her opinion in such matters.  Among other things, he had seen\nher one day defy a vicious and fierce Corsican–a common terror in the\ntown–who had chased his grown daughter with a heavy rope in his hand,\ndeclaring he would wear it out on her.  Cautious citizens got out of the\nway, but Jane Clemens opened her door to the fugitive; then, instead of\nrushing in and closing it, spread her arms across it, barring the way.\nThe man raved, and threatened her with the rope, but she did not flinch\nor show any sign of fear.  She stood there and shamed and defied him\nuntil he slunk off, crestfallen and conquered.  Any one as brave as his\nmother must have a perfect conscience, Sam thought, and would know how to\ntake care of it.  In the darkness he would say his prayers, especially\nwhen a thunderstorm was coming, and vow to begin a better life.  He\ndetested Sunday-school as much as he did day-school, and once his brother\nOrion, who was moral and religious, had threatened to drag him there by\nthe collar, but, as the thunder got louder, Sam decided that he loved\nSunday-school and would go the next Sunday without being invited.",
        "Sam’s days were not all disturbed by fierce events.  They were mostly\nfilled with pleasanter things.  There were picnics sometimes, and\nferryboat excursions, and any day one could roam the woods, or fish,\nalone or in company.  The hills and woods around Hannibal were never\ndisappointing.  There was the cave with its marvels.  There was Bear\nCreek, where he had learned to swim.  He had seen two playmates drown;\ntwice, himself, he had been dragged ashore, more dead than alive; once by\na slave girl, another time by a slave man–Neal Champ, of the Pavey\nHotel.  But he had persevered, and with success.  He could swim better\nthan any playmate of his age.",
        "It was the river that he cared for most.  It was the pathway that led to\nthe great world outside.  He would sit by it for hours and dream.  He\nwould venture out on it in a quietly borrowed boat, when he was barely\nstrong enough to lift an oar.  He learned to know all its moods and\nphases.",
        "More than anything in the world he hungered to make a trip on one of the\nbig, smart steamers that were always passing.  “You can hardly imagine\nwhat it meant,” he reflected, once, “to a boy in those days, shut in as\nwe were, to see those steamboats pass up and down, and never take a trip\non them.”",
        "It was at the mature age of nine that he found he could endure this no\nlonger.  One day when the big packet came down and stopped at Hannibal,\nhe slipped aboard and crept under one of the boats on the upper deck.\nThen the signal-bells rang, the steamer backed away and swung into\nmidstream; he was really going at last.  He crept from beneath the boat\nand sat looking out over the water and enjoying the scenery.  Then it\nbegan to rain–a regular downpour.  He crept back under the boat, but his\nlegs were outside, and one of the crew saw him.  He was dragged out and\nat the next stop set ashore.  It was the town of Louisiana, where there\nwere Lampton relatives, who took him home.  Very likely the home-coming\nwas not entirely pleasant, though a “lesson,” too, in his general\neducation.",
        "And always, each summer, there was the farm, where his recreation was no\nlonger mere girl plays and swings, with a colored nurse following about,\nbut sports with his older boy cousins, who went hunting with the men, for\npartridges by day and for ’coons and ’possums by night.  Sometimes the\nlittle boy followed the hunters all night long, and returned with them\nthrough the sparkling and fragrant morning, fresh, hungry, and\ntriumphant, just in time for breakfast.  So it is no wonder that Little\nSam, at nine, was no longer Little Sam, but plain Sam Clemens, and grown\nup.  If there were doubtful spots in his education–matters related to\nsmoking and strong words–it is also no wonder, and experience even in\nthese lines was worth something in a book like Tom Sawyer.",
        "The boy Sam Clemens was not a particularly attractive lad.  He was rather\nundersized, and his head seemed too large for his body.  He had a mass of\nlight sandy hair, which he plastered down to keep from curling.  His eyes\nwere keen and blue and his features rather large.  Still, he had a fair,\ndelicate complexion when it was not blackened by grime and tan; a gentle,\nwinning manner; a smile and a slow way of speaking that made him a\nfavorite with his companions.  He did not talk much, and was thought to\nbe rather dull–was certainly so in most of his lessons–but, for some\nreason, he never spoke that every playmate in hearing did not stop,\nwhatever he was doing, to listen.  Perhaps it would be a plan for a new\ngame or lark; perhaps it was something droll; perhaps it was just a\ncasual remark that his peculiar drawl made amusing.  His mother always\nreferred to his slow fashion of speech as “Sammy’s long talk.”  Her own\nspeech was even more deliberate, though she seemed not to notice it.  Sam\nwas more like his mother than the others.  His brother, Henry Clemens,\nthree years younger, was as unlike Sam as possible.  He did not have the\n\"long talk,” and was a handsome, obedient little fellow whom the\nmischievous Sam loved to tease.  Henry was to become the Sid of Tom\nSawyer, though he was in every way a finer character than Sid.  With the\ndeath of little Benjamin, Sam and Henry had been drawn much closer\ntogether, and, in spite of Sam’s pranks, loved each other dearly.  For\nthe pranks were only occasional, and Sam’s love for Henry was constant.\nHe fought for him oftener than with him.",
        "Many of the home incidents in the Tom Sawyer book really happened.  Sam\ndid clod Henry for getting him into trouble about the colored thread\nwith which he sewed his shirt when he came home from swimming; he did\ninveigle a lot of boys into whitewashing a fence for him; he did give\npainkiller to Peter, the cat.  As for escaping punishment for his\nmisdeeds, as described in the book, this was a daily matter, and his\nmethods suited the occasions.  For, of course, Tom Sawyer was Sam Clemens\nhimself, almost entirely, as most readers of that book have imagined.\nHowever, we must have another chapter for Tom Sawyer and his doings–the\nreal Tom and his real doings with those graceless, lovable associates,\nJoe Harper and Huckleberry Finn.",
        "In beginning “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” the author says, “Most of the\nadventures recorded in this book really occurred,” and he tells us that\nHuck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, though not from a single\nindividual, being a composite of three boys whom Mark Twain had known.",
        "The three boys were himself, almost entirely, with traces of two\nschoolmates, John Briggs and Will Bowen.  John Briggs was also the\noriginal of Joe Harper, the “Terror of the Seas.”  As for Huck Finn, the\n\"Red-Handed,” his original was a village waif named Tom Blankenship, who\nneeded no change for his part in the story.",
        "The Blankenship family picked up an uncertain livelihood, fishing and\nhunting, and lived at first under a tree in a bark shanty, but later\nmoved into a large, barn-like building, back of the Clemens home on Hill\nStreet.  There were three male members of the household: Old Ben, the\nfather, shiftless and dissolute; young Ben, the eldest son–a doubtful\ncharacter, with certain good traits; and Tom–that is to say, Huck, who\nwas just as he is described in the book–a ruin of rags, a river-rat,\nkind of heart, and accountable for his conduct to nobody in the world.\nHe could come and go as he chose; he never had to work or go to school;\nhe could do all the things, good and bad, that other boys longed to do\nand were forbidden.  To them he was the symbol of liberty; his knowledge\nof fishing, trapping, signs, and of the woods and river gave value to his\nsociety, while the fact that it was forbidden made it necessary to Sam\nClemens’s happiness.",
        "The Blankenships being handy to the back gate of the Hill Street house,\nhe adopted them at sight.  Their free mode of life suited him.  He was\nlikely to be there at any hour of the day, and Tom made cat-call signals\nat night that would bring Sam out on the shed roof at the back and down a\nlittle trellis and flight of steps to the group of boon companions,\nwhich, besides Tom, usually included John Briggs, Will Pitts, and the two\nyounger Bowen boys.  They were not malicious boys, but just mischievous,\nfun-loving boys–little boys of ten or twelve–rather thoughtless, being\nmainly bent on having a good time.",
        "They had a wide field of action: they ranged from Holliday’s Hill on the\nnorth to the cave on the south, and over the fields and through all the\nwoods between.  They explored both banks of the river, the islands, and\nthe deep wilderness of the Illinois shore.  They could run like turkeys\nand swim like ducks; they could handle a boat as if born in one.  No\norchard or melon-patch was entirely safe from them.  No dog or slave\npatrol was so watchful that they did not sooner or later elude it.  They\nborrowed boats with or without the owner’s consent–it did not matter.",
        "Most of their expeditions were harmless enough.  They often cruised up to\nTurtle Island, about two miles above Hannibal, and spent the day\nfeasting.  There were quantities of turtles and their eggs there, and\nmussels, and plenty of fish.  Fishing and swimming were their chief\npastimes, with incidental raiding, for adventure.  Bear Creek was their\nswimming-place by day, and the river-front at night-fall–a favorite spot\nbeing where the railroad bridge now ends.  It was a good distance across\nto the island where, in the book, Tom Sawyer musters his pirate band, and\nwhere later Huck found Nigger Jim, but quite often in the evening they\nswam across to it, and when they had frolicked for an hour or more on the\nsandbar at the head of the island, they would swim back in the dusk,\nbreasting the strong, steady Mississippi current without exhaustion or\ndread.  They could swim all day, those little scamps, and seemed to have\nno fear.  Once, during his boyhood, Sam Clemens swam across to the\nIllinois side, then turned and swam back again without landing, a\ndistance of at least two miles as he had to go.  He was seized with a\ncramp on the return trip.  His legs became useless and he was obliged to\nmake the remaining distance with his arms.",
        "The adventures of Sam Clemens and his comrades would fill several books\nof the size of Tom Sawyer.  Many of them are, of course, forgotten now,\nbut those still remembered show that Mark Twain had plenty of real\nmaterial.",
        "It was not easy to get money in those days, and the boys were often\nwithout it.  Once “Huck” Blankenship had the skin of a ’coon he had\ncaptured, and offered to sell it to raise capital.  At Selms’s store, on\nWild Cat Corner, the ’coon-skin would bring ten cents.  But this was not\nenough.  The boys thought of a plan to make it bring more.  Selms’s back\nwindow was open, and the place where he kept his pelts was pretty handy.\nHuck went around to the front door and sold the skin for ten cents to\nSelms, who tossed it back on the pile.  Then Huck came back and, after\nwaiting a reasonable time, crawled in the open window, got the ’coon-\nskin, and sold it to Selms again.  He did this several times that\nafternoon, and the capital of the band grew.  But at last John Pierce,\nSelms’s clerk, said:",
        "“Look here, Mr. Selms, there’s something wrong about this.  That boy has\nbeen selling us ’coonskins all the afternoon.”",
        "Selms went back to his pile of pelts.  There were several sheep-skins and\nsome cow-hides, but only one ’coon-skin–the one he had that moment\nbought.",
        "Selms himself, in after years, used to tell this story as a great joke.",
        "One of the boys’ occasional pastimes was to climb Holliday’s Hill and\nroll down big stones, to frighten the people who were driving by.\nHolliday’s Hill above the road was steep; a stone once started would go\nplunging downward and bound across the road with the deadly momentum of a\nshell.  The boys would get a stone poised, then wait until they saw a\nteam approaching, and, calculating the distance, would give the boulder a\nstart.  Dropping behind the bushes, they would watch the sudden effect\nupon the party below as the great missile shot across the road a few\nyards before them.  This was huge sport, but they carried it too far.\nFor at last they planned a grand climax that would surpass anything\nbefore attempted in the stone-rolling line.",
        "A monstrous boulder was lying up there in the right position to go down-\nhill, once started.  It would be a glorious thing to see that great stone\ngo smashing down a hundred yards or so in front of some peaceful-minded\ncountryman jogging along the road.  Quarrymen had been getting out rock\nnot far away and had left their picks and shovels handy.  The boys\nborrowed the tools and went to work to undermine the big stone.  They\nworked at it several hours.  If their parents had asked them to work like\nthat, they would have thought they were being killed.",
        "Finally, while they were still digging, the big stone suddenly got loose\nand started down.  They were not ready for it at all.  Nobody was coming\nbut an old colored man in a cart; their splendid stone was going to be\nwasted.",
        "One could hardly call it wasted, however; they had planned for a\nthrilling result, and there was certainly thrill enough while it lasted.\nIn the first place the stone nearly caught Will Bowen when it started.\nJohn Briggs had that moment quit digging and handed Will the pick.  Will\nwas about to take his turn when Sam Clemens leaped aside with a yell:",
        "“Lookout, boys; she’s coming!”",
        "She came.  The huge boulder kept to the ground at first, then, gathering\nmomentum, it went bounding into the air.  About half-way down the hill it\nstruck a sapling and cut it clean off.  This turned its course a little,\nand the negro in the cart, hearing the noise and seeing the great mass\ncome crashing in his direction, made a wild effort to whip up his mule.",
        "The boys watched their bomb with growing interest.  It was headed\nstraight for the negro, also for a cooper-shop across the road.  It made\nlonger leaps with every bound, and, wherever it struck, fragments and\ndust would fly.  The shop happened to be empty, but the rest of the\ncatastrophe would call for close investigation.  They wanted to fly, but\nthey could not move until they saw the rock land.  It was making mighty\nleaps now, and the terrified negro had managed to get exactly in its\npath.  The boys stood holding their breath, their mouths open.",
        "Then, suddenly, they could hardly believe their eyes; a little way above\nthe road the boulder struck a projection, made one mighty leap into the\nair, sailed clear over the negro and his mule, and landed in the soft\ndirt beyond the road, only a fragment striking the shop, damaging, but\nnot wrecking it.  Half buried in the ground, the great stone lay there\nfor nearly forty years; then it was broken up.  It was the last rock the\nboys ever rolled down.  Nearly sixty years later John Briggs and Mark\nTwain walked across Holliday’s Hill and looked down toward the river\nroad.",
        "Mark Twain said: “It was a mighty good thing, John, that stone acted the\nway it did.  We might have had to pay a fancy price for that old darky I\ncan see him yet.\"[1]",
        "It can be no harm now, to confess that the boy Sam Clemens–a pretty\nsmall boy, a good deal less than twelve at the time, and by no means\nlarge for his years–was the leader of this unhallowed band.  In any\ncase, truth requires this admission.  If the band had a leader, it was\nSam, just as it was Tom Sawyer in the book.  They were always ready to\nlisten to him–they would even stop fishing to do that–and to follow his\nplans.  They looked to him for ideas and directions, and he gloried in\nbeing a leader and showing off, just as Tom did in the book.  It seems\nalmost a pity that in those far-off barefoot days he could not have\nlooked down the years and caught a glimpse of his splendid destiny.",
        "But of literary fame he could never have dreamed.  The chief ambition–\nthe “permanent ambition\"–of every Hannibal boy was to be a pilot.  The\npilot in his splendid glass perch with his supreme power and princely\nsalary was to them the noblest of all human creatures.  An elder Bowen\nboy was already a pilot, and when he came home, as he did now and then,\nhis person seemed almost too sacred to touch.",
        "Next to being a pilot, Sam thought he would like to be a pirate or a\nbandit or a trapper-scout–something gorgeous and awe-inspiring, where\nhis word, his nod, would still be law.  The river kept his river ambition\nalways fresh, and with the cave and the forest round about helped him to\nimagine those other things.",
        "The cave was the joy of his heart.  It was a real cave, not merely a\nhole, but a marvel of deep passages and vaulted chambers that led back\ninto the bluffs and far down into the earth, even below the river, some\nsaid.  Sam Clemens never tired of the cave.  He was willing any time to\nquit fishing or swimming or melon-hunting for the three-mile walk, or\npull, that brought them to its mystic door.  With its long corridors, its\nroyal chambers hung with stalactites, its remote hiding-places, it was\nexactly suitable, Sam thought, to be the lair of an outlaw, and in it he\nimagined and carried out adventures which his faithful followers may not\nalways have understood, though enjoying them none the less for that\nreason.",
        "In Tom Sawyer, Indian Joe dies in the cave.  He did not die there in real\nlife, but was lost there once and was very weak when they found him.  He\nwas not as bad as painted in the book, though he was dissolute and\naccounted dangerous; and when one night he died in reality, there came a\nthunder-storm so terrific that Sam Clemens at home, in bed, was certain\nthat Satan had come in person for the half-breed’s soul.  He covered his\nhead and said his prayers with fearful anxiety lest the evil one might\ndecide to save another trip by taking him along then.",
        "The treasure-digging adventure in the book had this foundation in fact:\nIt was said that two French trappers had once buried a chest of gold\nabout two miles above Hannibal, and that it was still there.  Tom\nBlankenship (Huck) one morning said he had dreamed just where the\ntreasure was, and that if the boys–Sam Clemens and John Briggs–would go\nwith him and help dig, he would divide.  The boys had great faith in\ndreams, especially in Huck’s dreams.  They followed him to a place with\nsome shovels and picks, and he showed them just where to dig.  Then he\nsat down under the shade of a pawpaw-bush and gave orders.",
        "They dug nearly all day.  Huck didn’t dig any himself, because he had\ndone the dreaming, which was his share.  They didn’t find the treasure\nthat day, and next morning they took two long iron rods to push and drive\ninto the ground until they should strike something.  They struck a number\nof things, but when they dug down it was never the money they found.\nThat night the boys said they wouldn’t dig any more.",
        "But Huck had another dream.  He dreamed the gold was exactly under the\nlittle pawpaw-tree.  This sounded so circumstantial that they went back\nand dug another day.  It was hot weather, too–August–and that night\nthey were nearly dead.  Even Huck gave it up then.  He said there was\nsomething wrong about the way they dug.",
        "This differs a good deal from the treasure incident in the book, but it\nshows us what respect the boys had for the gifts of the ragamuffin\noriginal of Huck Finn.  Tom Blankenship’s brother Ben was also used, and\nvery importantly, in the creation of our beloved Huck.  Ben was\nconsiderably older, but certainly no more reputable, than Tom.  He\ntormented the smaller boys, and they had little love for him.  Yet\nsomewhere in Ben Blankenship’s nature there was a fine, generous strain\nof humanity that provided Mark Twain with that immortal episode–the\nsheltering of Nigger Jim.  This is the real story:",
        "A slave ran off from Monroe County, Missouri, and got across the\n     river into Illinois.  Ben used to fish and hunt over there in the\n     swamps, and one day found him.  It was considered a most worthy act\n     in those days to return a runaway slave; in fact, it was a crime not\n     to do it.  Besides, there was for this one a reward of fifty\n     dollars–a fortune to ragged, out-cast Ben Blankenship.  That money,\n     and the honor he could acquire, must have been tempting to the waif,\n     but it did not outweigh his human sympathy.  Instead of giving him\n     up and claiming the reward, Ben kept the runaway over there in the\n     marshes all summer.  The negro fished, and Ben carried him scraps of\n     other food.  Then, by and by, the facts leaked out.  Some wood-\n     choppers went on a hunt for the fugitive and chased him to what was\n     called Bird Slough.  There, trying to cross a drift, he was drowned.",
        "Huck’s struggle in the book is between conscience and the law, on one\nside, and deep human sympathy on the other.  Ben Blankenship’s struggle,\nsupposing there was one, would be between sympathy and the offered\nreward.  Neither conscience nor law would trouble him.  It was his native\nhumanity that made him shelter the runaway, and it must have been strong\nand genuine to make him resist the lure of the fifty-dollar prize.",
        "There was another chapter to this incident.  A few days after the\ndrowning of the runaway, Sam Clemens and his band made their way to the\nplace and were pushing the drift about, when, all at once, the negro shot\nup out of the water, straight and terrible, a full half-length in the\nair.  He had gone down foremost and had been caught in the drift.  The\nboys did not stop to investigate, but flew in terror to report their\ntale.",
        "Those early days seem to have been full of gruesome things.  In “The\nInnocents Abroad,” the author tells how he once spent a night in his\nfather’s office and discovered there a murdered man.  This was a true\nincident.  The man had been stabbed that afternoon and carried into the\nhouse to die.  Sam and John Briggs had been playing truant all day and\nknew nothing of the matter.  Sam thought the office safer than his home,\nwhere his mother was probably sitting up for him.  He climbed in by a\nwindow and lay down on the lounge, but did not sleep.  Presently he\nnoticed what appeared to be an unusual shape on the floor.  He tried to\nturn his face to the wall and forget it, but that would not do.  In agony\nhe watched the thing until at last a square of moonlight gradually\nrevealed a sight that he never forgot.  In the book he says:",
        "“I went away from there.  I do not say that I went in any sort of\n     hurry, but I simply went–that is sufficient.  I went out of the\n     window, and I carried the sash along with me.  I did not need the\n     sash, but it was handier to take it than to leave it, and so I took\n     it.  I was not scared, but I was considerable agitated.”",
        "Sam was not yet twelve, for his father was no longer living when the boy\nhad reached that age.  And how many things had crowded themselves into\nhis few brief years!  We must be content here with only a few of them.\nOur chapter is already too long.",
        "Ministers and deacons did not prophesy well for Sam Clemens and his mad\ncompanions.  They spoke feelingly of state prison and the gallows.  But\nthe boys were a disappointing lot.  Will Bowen became a fine river-pilot.\nWill Pitts was in due time a leading merchant and bank president.  John\nBriggs grew into a well-to-do and highly respected farmer.  Huck Finn–\nwhich is to say, Tom Blankenship–died an honored citizen and justice of\nthe peace in a Western town.  As for Sam Clemens, we shall see what he\nbecame as the chapters pass.",
        "[1] John Briggs died in 1907; earlier in the same year the writer of this\nmemoir spent an afternoon with him and obtained from him most of the\nmaterial for this chapter.",
        "Sam was at Mr. Cross’s school on the Square in due time, and among the\npupils were companions that appealed to his gentler side.  There were the\nRoBards boys–George, the best Latin scholar, and John, who always won\nthe good-conduct medal, and would one day make all the other boys envious\nby riding away with his father to California, his curls of gold blowing\nin the wind.",
        "There was Buck Brown, a rival speller, and John Garth, who would marry\nlittle Helen Kercheval, and Jimmy MacDaniel, whom it was well to know\nbecause his father kept a pastry-shop and he used to bring cakes and\ncandy to school.",
        "There were also a number of girls.  Bettie Ormsley, Artemisia Briggs, and\nJennie Brady were among the girls he remembered in later years, and Mary\nMiller, who was nearly double his age and broke his heart by getting\nmarried one day, a thing he had not expected at all.",
        "Yet through it all he appears, like Tom Sawyer, to have had one faithful\nsweetheart.  In the book it is Becky Thatcher–in real life she was Laura\nHawkins.  The Clemens and Hawkins families lived opposite, and the\nchildren were early acquainted.  The “Black Avenger of the Spanish Main\"\nwas very gentle when he was playing at house-building with little Laura,\nand once, when he dropped a brick on her finger, he cried the louder and\nlonger of the two.",
        "For he was a tender-hearted boy.  He would never abuse an animal, except\nwhen his tendency to mischief ran away with him, as in the “pain-killer\"\nincident.  He had a real passion for cats.  Each summer he carried his\ncat to the farm in a basket, and it always had a place by him at the\ntable.  He loved flowers–not as a boy botanist or gardener, but as a\ncompanion who understood their thoughts.  He pitied dead leaves and dry\nweeds because their lives were ended and they would never know summer\nagain or grow glad with another spring.  Even in that early time he had\nthat deeper sympathy which one day would offer comfort to humanity and\nmake every man his friend.",
        "But we are drifting away from Sam Clemens’s school-days.  They will not\ntrouble us much longer now.  More than anything in the world Sam detested\nschool, and he made any excuse to get out of going.  It is hard to say\njust why, unless it was the restraint and the long hours of confinement.",
        "The Square in Hannibal, where stood the school of Mr. Cross, was a grove\nin those days, with plum-trees and hazel-bushes and grape-vines.  When\nspring came, the children gathered flowers at recess, climbed trees, and\nswung in the vines.  It was a happy place enough, only–it was school.\nTo Sam Clemens, the spelling-bee every Friday afternoon was the one thing\nthat made it worth while.  Sam was a leader at spelling–it was one of\nhis gifts–he could earn compliments even from Mr. Cross, whose name, it\nwould seem, was regarded as descriptive.  Once in a moment of inspiration\nSam wrote on his late:",
        "“Cross by name and Cross by nature,\n             Cross jumped over an Irish potato.”",
        "John Briggs thought this a great effort, and urged the author to write it\non the blackboard at noon.  Sam hesitated.",
        "“Oh, pshaw!” said John, “I wouldn’t be afraid to do it.”",
        "“I dare you to do it,” said Sam.",
        "This was enough.  While Mr. Cross was at dinner John wrote in a large\nhand the fine couplet.  The teacher returned and called the school to\norder.  He looked at the blackboard, then, searchingly, at John Briggs.\nThe handwriting was familiar.",
        "“Did you do that?” he asked, ominously.",
        "It was a time for truth.",
        "“Yes, sir,” said John.",
        "“Come here!”  And John came and paid handsomely for his publishing\nventure.  Sam Clemens expected that the author would be called for next;\nbut perhaps Mr. Cross had exhausted himself on John.  Sam did not often\nescape.  His back kept fairly warm from one “flailing” to the next.",
        "Yet he usually wore one of the two medals offered in that school–the\nmedal for spelling.  Once he lost it by leaving the first “r” out of\nFebruary.  Laura Hawkins was on the floor against him, and he was a\ngallant boy.  If it had only been Huck Brown he would have spelled that\nand all the other months backward, to show off.  There were moments of\ntriumph that almost made school worth while; the rest of the time it was\nprison and servitude.",
        "But then one day came freedom.  Judge Clemens, who, in spite of\nmisfortune, had never lost faith in humanity, indorsed a large note for a\nneighbor, and was obliged to pay it.  Once more all his property was\ntaken away.  Only a few scanty furnishings were rescued from the wreck.\nA St. Louis cousin saved the home, but the Clemens family could not\nafford to live in it.  They moved across the street and joined\nhousekeeping with another family.",
        "Judge Clemens had one hope left.  He was a candidate for the clerkship of\nthe surrogate court, a good office, and believed his election sure.  His\nbusiness misfortunes had aroused wide sympathy.  He took no chances,\nhowever, and made a house-to house canvas of the district, regardless of\nthe weather, probably undermining his health.  He was elected by a large\nmajority, and rejoiced that his worries were now at an end.  They were,\nindeed, over.  At the end of February he rode to the county seat to take\nthe oath of office.  He returned through a drenching storm and reached\nhome nearly frozen. Pneumonia set in, and a few days later he was\ndying.  His one comfort now was the Tennessee land.  He said it would\nmake them all rich and happy.  Once he whispered:",
        "“Cling to the land; cling to the land and wait.  Let nothing beguile it\naway from you.”",
        "He was a man who had rarely displayed affection for his children.  But\npresently he beckoned to Pamela, now a lovely girl of nineteen, and,\nputting his arm around her neck, kissed her for the first time in years.",
        "“Let me die,” he said.",
        "He did not speak again.  A little more, and his worries had indeed ended.\nThe hard struggle of an upright, impractical man had come to a close.\nThis was in March, 1847.  John Clemens had lived less than forty-nine\nyears.",
        "The children were dazed.  They had loved their father and honored his\nnobility of purpose.  The boy Sam was overcome with remorse.  He recalled\nhis wildness and disobedience–a thousand things trifling enough at the\ntime, but heartbreaking now.  Boy and man, Samuel Clemens was never\nspared by remorse.  Leading him into the room where his father lay, his\nmother said some comforting words and asked him to make her a promise.",
        "He flung himself into her arms, sobbing: “I will promise anything, if you\nwon’t make me go to school!  Anything!”",
        "After a moment his mother said: “No, Sammy, you need not go to school any\nmore.  Only promise me to be a better boy.  Promise not to break my\nheart!”",
        "He gave his promise to be faithful and industrious and upright, like his\nfather.  Such a promise was a serious matter, and Sam Clemens, underneath\nall, was a serious lad.  He would not be twelve until November, but his\nmother felt that he would keep his word.",
        "Orion Clemens returned to St. Louis, where he was receiving a salary of\nten dollars a week–high wage for those days–out of which he could send\nthree dollars weekly to the family.  Pamela, who played the guitar and\npiano very well, gave music lessons, and so helped the family fund.\nPamela Clemens, the original of Cousin Mary, in “Tom Sawyer,” was a sweet\nand noble girl.  Henry was too young to work, but Sam was apprenticed to\na printer named Ament, who had recently moved to Hannibal and bought a\nweekly paper, “The Courier.”  Sam agreed with his mother that the\nprinting trade offered a chance for further education without attending\nschool, and then, some day, there might be wages.",
        "The terms of Samuel Clemens’s apprenticeship were the usual thing for\nthat day: board and clothes–\"more board than clothes, and not much of\neither,” Mark Twain used to say.",
        "“I was supposed to get two suits of clothes a year, but I didn’t get\nthem.  I got one suit and took the rest out in Ament’s old garments,\nwhich didn’t fit me in any noticeable way.  I was only about half as big\nas he was, and when I had on one of his shirts I felt as if I had on a\ncircus-tent.  I had to turn the trousers up to my ears to make them short\nenough.”",
        "Another apprentice, a huge creature, named Wales McCormick, was so large\nthat Ament’s clothes were much too small for him.  The two apprentices,\nfitted out with their employer’s cast-off garments, were amusing enough,\nno doubt.  Sam and Wales ate in the kitchen at first, but later at the\nfamily table with Mr. and Mrs. Ament and Pet McMurry, a journeyman\nprinter.  McMurry was a happy soul, as one could almost guess from his\nname.  He had traveled far and learned much.  What the two apprentices\ndid not already know, Pet McMurry could teach them.  Sam Clemens had\npromised to be a good boy, and he was so, by the standards of boyhood.\nHe was industrious, regular at his work, quick to learn, kind, and\ntruthful.  Angels could hardly be more than that in a printing-office.\nBut when food was scarce, even an angel–a young printer-angel–could\nhardly resist slipping down the cellar stairs at night, for raw potatoes,\nonions, and apples, which they cooked in the office, where the boys slept\non a pallet on the floor.  Wales had a wonderful way of cooking a potato\nwhich his fellow apprentice never forgot.",
        "How one wishes for a photograph of Sam Clemens at that period!  But in\nthose days there were only daguerreotypes, and they were expensive\nthings.  There is a letter, though, written long afterward, by Pet\nMcMurry to Mark Twain, which contains this paragraph:",
        "“If your memory extends so far back, you will recall a little sandy-\n     haired boy of nearly a quarter of a century ago, in the printing-\n     office at Hannibal, over the Brittingham drug-store, mounted upon a\n     little box at the case, who used to love to sing so well the\n     expression of the poor drunken man who was supposed to have fallen\n     by the wayside, ’If ever I get up again, I’ll stay up–if I kin.’”",
        "And with this portrait we must be content–we cannot doubt its truth.",
        "Sam was soon office favorite and in time became chief stand-by.  When he\nhad been at work a year, he could set type accurately, run the job press\nto the tune of “Annie Laurie,” and he had charge of the circulation.\nThat is to say, he carried the papers–a mission of real importance, for\na long, sagging span of telegraph-wire had reached across the river to\nHannibal, and Mexican-war news delivered hot from the front gave the\nmessenger a fine prestige.",
        "He even did editing, of a kind.  That is to say, when Ament was not in\nthe office and copy was needed, Sam hunted him up, explained the\nsituation, and saw that the necessary matter was produced.  He was not\nambitious to write–not then.  He wanted to be a journeyman printer, like\nPet, and travel and see the world.  Sometimes he thought he would like to\nbe a clown, or “end man” in a minstrel troupe.  Once for a week he served\nas subject for a traveling hypnotist-and was dazzled by his success.",
        "But he stuck to printing, and rapidly became a neat, capable workman.\nAment gave him a daily task, after which he was free.  By three in the\nafternoon he was likely to finish his stint.  Then he was off for the\nriver or the cave, joining his old comrades.  Or perhaps he would go with\nLaura Hawkins to gather wild columbine on the high cliff above the river,\nknown as Lover’s Leap.  When winter came these two sometimes went to Bear\nCreek, skating; or together they attended parties, where the old-\nfashioned games “Ring-around-Rosy” and “Dusty Miller” were the chief\namusements.",
        "In “The Gilded Age,” Laura Hawkins at twelve is pictured “with her dainty\nhands propped into the ribbon-bordered pockets of her apron .  .  . a\nvision to warm the coldest heart and bless and cheer the saddest.”  That\nwas the real Laura, though her story in that book in no way resembles the\nreality.",
        "It was just at this time that an incident occurred which may be looked\nback upon now as a turning-point in Samuel Clemens’s life.  Coming home\nfrom the office one afternoon, he noticed a square of paper being swept\nalong by the wind.  He saw that it was printed–was interested\nprofessionally in seeing what it was like.  He chased the flying scrap\nand overtook it.  It was a leaf from some old history of Joan of Arc, and\npictured the hard lot of the “maid” in the tower at Rouen, reviled and\nmistreated by her ruffian captors.  There were some paragraphs of\ndescription, but the rest was pitiful dialogue.",
        "Sam had never heard of Joan before–he knew nothing of history.  He was\nno reader.  Orion was fond of books, and Pamela; even little Henry had\nread more than Sam.  But now, as he read, there awoke in him a deep\nfeeling of pity and indignation, and with it a longing to know more of\nthe tragic story.  It was an interest that would last his life through,\nand in the course of time find expression in one of the rarest books ever\nwritten.",
        "The first result was that Sam began to read.  He hunted up everything he\ncould find on the subject of Joan, and from that went into French history\nin general–indeed, into history of every kind.  Samuel Clemens had\nsuddenly become a reader–almost a student.  He even began the study of\nlanguages, German and Latin, but was not able to go on for lack of time\nand teachers.",
        "He became a hater of tyranny, a champion of the weak.  Watching a game of\nmarbles or tops, he would remark to some offender, in his slow drawling\nway, “You mustn’t cheat that boy.”",
        "And the cheating stopped, or trouble followed.",
        "A Hannibal paper, the “Journal,” was for sale under a mortgage of five\nhundred dollars, and Orion Clemens, returning from St. Louis, borrowed\nthe money and bought it.  Sam’s two years’ apprenticeship with Ament had\nbeen completed, and Orion felt that together they could carry on the\npaper and win success.  Henry Clemens, now eleven, was also taken out of\nschool to learn type-setting.",
        "Orion was a better printer than proprietor.  Like so many of his family,\nhe was a visionary, gentle and credulous, ready to follow any new idea.\nMuch advice was offered him, and he tried to follow it all.",
        "He began with great hopes and energy.  He worked like a slave and did not\nspare the others.  The paper was their hope of success.  Sam, especially,\nwas driven.  There were no more free afternoons.  In some chapters\nwritten by Orion Clemens in later life, he said:",
        "“I was tyrannical and unjust to Sam.  He was swift and clean as a\n     good journeyman.  I gave him ’takes,’ and, if he got through well, I\n     begrudged him the time and made him work more.”",
        "Orion did not mean to be unjust.  The struggle against opposition and\ndebt was bitter.  He could not be considerate.",
        "The paper for a time seemed on the road to success, but Orion worked too\nhard and tried too many schemes.  His enthusiasm waned and most of his\nschemes turned out poorly.  By the end of the year the “Journal” was on\nthe down grade.",
        "In time when the need of money became great, Orion made a trip to\nTennessee to try to raise something on the land which they still held\nthere.  He left Sam in charge of the paper, and, though its proprietor\nreturned empty-handed, his journey was worth while, for it was during his\nabsence that Samuel Clemens began the career that would one day make him\nMark Twain.",
        "Sam had concluded to edit the paper in a way that would liven up the\ncirculation.  He had never written anything for print, but he believed he\nknew what the subscribers wanted.  The editor of a rival paper had been\ncrossed in love, and was said to have tried to drown himself.  Sam wrote\nan article telling all the history of the affair, giving names and\ndetails.  Then on the back of two big wooden letters, used for bill-\nprinting, he engraved illustrations of the victim wading out into the\nriver, testing the depth of the water with a stick.",
        "The paper came out, and the demand for it kept the Washington hand-press\nbusy.  The injured editor sent word that he was coming over to thrash the\nwhole Journal staff, but he left town, instead, for the laugh was too\ngeneral.",
        "Sam also wrote a poem which startled orthodox readers.  Then Orion\nreturned and reduced him to the ranks.  In later years Orion saw his\nmistake.",
        "“I could have distanced all competitors, even then,” he wrote,\n     “if I had recognized Sam’s ability and let him go ahead, merely\n     keeping him from offending worthy persons.”",
        "Sam was not discouraged.  He liked the taste of print.  He sent two\nanecdotes to the Philadelphia Saturday Evening Post.  Both were accepted\n–without payment, of course, in those days–and when they appeared he\nwalked on air.  This was in 1851.  Nearly sixty years later he said:",
        "“Seeing them in print was a joy which rather exceeded anything in\n      that line I have ever experienced since.”",
        "However, he wrote nothing further for the “Post.”  Orion printed two of\nhis sketches in the “Journal,” which was the extent of his efforts at\nthis time.  None of this early work has been preserved.  Files of the\n\"Post” exist, but the sketches were unsigned and could hardly be\nidentified.",
        "The Hannibal paper dragged along from year to year.  Orion could pay\nnothing on the mortgage–financial matters becoming always worse.  He\ncould barely supply the plainest food and clothing for the family.  Sam\nand Henry got no wages, of course.  Then real disaster came.  A cow got\ninto the office one night, upset a type-case, and ate up two composition\nrollers.  Somewhat later a fire broke out and did considerable damage.\nThere was partial insurance, with which Orion replaced a few necessary\narticles; then, to save rent, he moved the office into the front room of\nthe home on Hill Street, where they were living again at this time.",
        "Samuel Clemens, however, now in his eighteenth year, felt that he was no\nlonger needed in Hannibal.  He was a capable workman, with little to do\nand no reward.  Orion, made irritable by his misfortunes, was not always\nkind.  Pamela, who, meantime, had married well, was settled in St. Louis.\nSam told his mother that he would visit Pamela and look about the city.\nThere would be work in St. Louis at good wages.",
        "He was going farther than St. Louis, but he dared not tell her.  Jane\nClemens, consenting, sighed as she put together his scanty belongings.\nSam was going away.  He had been a good boy of late years, but her faith\nin his resisting powers was not strong.  Presently she held up a little\nTestament.",
        "“I want you to take hold of the other end of this, Sam,” she said, “and\nmake me a promise.”",
        "The slim, wiry woman of forty-nine, gray-eyed, tender, and resolute,\nfaced the fair-cheeked youth of seventeen, his eyes as piercing and\nunwavering as her own.  How much alike they were!",
        "“I want you,” Jane Clemens said, “to repeat after me, Sam, these words: I\ndo solemnly swear that I will not throw a card or drink a drop of liquor\nwhile I am gone.”",
        "He repeated the vow after her, and she kissed him.",
        "“Remember that, Sam, and write to us,” she said.",
        "“And so,” writes Orion, “he went wandering in search of that comfort and\nadvancement, and those rewards of industry, which he had failed to find\nwhere I was–gloomy, taciturn, and selfish.  I not only missed his labor;\nwe all missed his abounding activity and merriment.”",
        "Samuel Clemens went to visit his sister Pamela in St. Louis and was\npresently at work, setting type on the “Evening News.”  He had no\nintention, however, of staying there.  His purpose was to earn money\nenough to take him to New York City.  The railroad had by this time\nreached St. Louis, and he meant to have the grand experience of a long\njourney “on the cars.”  Also, there was a Crystal Palace in New York,\nwhere a world’s exposition was going on.",
        "Trains were slow in 1853, and it required several days and nights to go\nfrom St. Louis to New York City, but to Sam Clemens it was a wonderful\njourney.  All day he sat looking out of the window, eating when he chose\nfrom the food he carried, curling up in his seat at night to sleep.  He\narrived at last with a few dollars in his pocket and a ten-dollar bill\nsewed into the lining of his coat.",
        "New York was rather larger than he expected.  All of the lower end of\nManhattan Island was covered by it.  The Crystal Palace–some distance\nout–stood at Forty-second Street and Sixth Avenue–the present site of\nBryant Park.  All the world’s newest wonders were to be seen there–a\ndazzling exhibition.  A fragment of the letter which Sam Clemens wrote to\nhis sister Pamela–the earliest piece of Mark Twain’s writing that has\nbeen preserved–expresses his appreciation of the big fair:",
        "“From the gallery (second floor) you have a glorious sight–the\n     flags of the different countries represented, the lofty dome,\n     glittering jewelry, gaudy tapestry, etc., with the busy crowd\n     passing to and fro–’tis a perfect fairy palace–beautiful beyond\n     description.",
        "“The machinery department is on the main floor, but I cannot\n     enumerate any of it on account of the lateness of the hour (past one\n     o’clock).  It would take more than a week to examine everything on\n     exhibition, and I was only in a little over two hours to-night.  I\n     only glanced at about one-third of the articles; and, having a poor\n     memory, I have enumerated scarcely any of even the principal\n     objects.  The visitors to the Palace average 6,000 daily–double the\n     population of Hannibal.  The price of admission being fifty cents,\n     they take in about $3,000.",
        "“The Latting Observatory (height about 280 feet) is near the Palace.\n     From it you can obtain a grand view of the city and the country\n     around.  The Croton Aqueduct, to supply the city with water, is the\n     greatest wonder yet.  Immense pipes are laid across the bed of the\n     Harlem River, and pass through the country to Westchester County,\n     where a whole river is turned from its course and brought to New\n     York.  From the reservoir in the city to Westchester County\n     reservoir the distance is thirty-eight miles, and, if necessary,\n     they could easily supply every family in New York with one hundred\n     barrels of water a day!",
        "“I am very sorry to learn that Henry has been sick.  He ought to go\n     to the country and take exercise, for he is not half so healthy as\n     Ma thinks he is.  If he had my walking to do, he would be another\n     boy entirely.  Four times every day I walk a little over a mile; and\n     working hard all day and walking four miles is exercise.  I am used\n     to it now, though, and it is no trouble.  Where is it Orion’s going\n     to?  Tell Ma my promises are faithfully kept; and if I have my\n     health I will take her to Ky. in the spring.  I shall save money for\n     this.",
        "“(It has just struck 2 A.M., and I always get up at six and am at\n     work at 7.) You ask where I spend my evenings.  Where would you\n     suppose, with a free printers’ library containing more than 4,000\n     volumes within a quarter of a mile of me, and nobody at home to talk\n     to?”",
        "“I shall write to Ella soon.  Write soon.\n     “Truly your Brother,",
        "“SAMY.",
        "“P.S.–I have written this by a light so dim that you nor Ma could\n     not read by it.”",
        "We get a fair idea of Samuel Clemens at seventeen from this letter.  For\none thing, he could write good, clear English, full of interesting facts.\nHe is enthusiastic, but not lavish of words.  He impresses us with his\nstatement that the visitors to the Palace each day are in number double\nthe population of Hannibal; a whole river is turned from its course to\nsupply New York City with water; the water comes thirty-eight miles, and\neach family could use a hundred barrels a day!  The letter reveals his\npersonal side–his kindly interest in those left behind, his anxiety for\nHenry, his assurance that the promise to his mother was being kept, his\nmemory of her longing to visit her old home.  And the boy who hated\nschool has become a reader–he is reveling in a printers’ library of\nthousands of volumes.  We feel, somehow, that Samuel Clemens has suddenly\nbecome quite a serious-minded person, that he has left Tom Sawyer and Joe\nHarper and Huck Finn somewhere in a beautiful country a long way behind.",
        "He found work with the firm of John A. Gray & Green, general printers, in\nCliff Street.  His pay was four dollars a week, in wild-cat money–that\nis, money issued by private banks–rather poor money, being generally at\na discount and sometimes worth less.  But if wages were low, living was\ncheap in those days, and Sam Clemens, lodging in a mechanics’ boarding-\nhouse in Duane Street, sometimes had fifty cents left on Saturday night\nwhen his board and washing were paid.",
        "Luckily, he had not set out to seek his fortune, but only to see\nsomething of the world.  He lingered in New York through the summer of\n1853, never expecting to remain long.  His letters of that period were\nfew.  In October he said, in a letter to Pamela, that he did not write to\nthe family because he did not know their whereabouts, Orion having sold\nthe paper and left Hannibal.",
        "“I have been fooling myself with the idea that I was going to leave\n     New York every day for the last two weeks,” he adds, which sounds\n     like the Mark Twain of fifty years later.  Farther along, he tells\n     of going to see Edwin Forrest, then playing at the Broadway Theater:",
        "“The play was the ’Gladiator.’  I did not like part of it much, but\n     other portions were really splendid.  In the latter part of the last\n     act. . . the man’s whole soul seems absorbed in the part he is\n     playing; and it is real startling to see him.  I am sorry I did not\n     see him play “Damon and Pythias,” the former character being the\n     greatest.  He appears in Philadelphia on Monday night.”",
        "A little farther along he says:",
        "“If my letters do not come often, you need not bother yourself about\n     me; for if you have a brother nearly eighteen years old who is not\n     able to take care of himself a few miles from home, such a brother\n     is not worth one’s thoughts.”",
        "Sam Clemens may have followed Forrest to Philadelphia.  At any rate, he\nwas there presently, “subbing” in the composing-rooms of the “Inquirer,\"\nsetting ten thousand ems a day, and receiving pay accordingly.  When\nthere was no vacancy for him to fill, he put in the time visiting the\nPhiladelphia libraries, art galleries, and historic landmarks.  After\nall, his chief business was sight-seeing.  Work was only a means to this\nend.  Chilly evenings, when he returned to his boarding-house, his room-\nmate, an Englishman named Sumner, grilled a herring over their small open\nfire, and this was a great feast.  He tried writing–obituary poetry, for\nthe “Philadelphia Ledger\"–but it was not accepted.",
        "“My efforts were not received with approval” was his comment long after.",
        "In the “Inquirer” office there was a printer named Frog, and sometimes,\nwhen he went out, the office “devils” would hang over his case a line\nwith a hook on it baited with a piece of red flannel.  They never got\ntired of this joke, and Frog never failed to get fighting mad when he saw\nthat dangling string with the bit of red flannel at the end.  No doubt\nSam Clemens had his share in this mischief.",
        "Sam found that he liked Philadelphia.  He could save a little money and\nsend something to his mother–small amounts, but welcome.  Once he\ninclosed a gold dollar, “to serve as a specimen of the kind of stuff we\nare paid with in Philadelphia.”  Better than doubtful “wild-cat,\"\ncertainly.  Of his work he writes:",
        "“One man has engaged me to work for him every Sunday till the first\n     of next April, when I shall return home to take Ma to Ky .  .  .  .\n     If I want to, I can get subbing every night of the week.  I go to\n     work at seven in the evening and work till three the next morning.\n     .  .  . The type is mostly agate and minion, with some bourgeois,\n     and when one gets a good agate “take,” he is sure to make money.  I\n     made $2.50 last Sunday.”",
        "There is a long description of a trip on the Fairmount stage in this\nletter, well-written and interesting, but too long to have place here.\nIn the same letter he speaks of the graves of Benjamin Franklin and his\nwife, which he had looked at through the iron railing of the locked\ninclosure.  Probably it did not occur to him that there might be points\nof similarity between Franklin’s career and his own.  Yet in time these\nwould be rather striking: each learned the printer’s trade; each worked\nin his brother’s office and wrote for the paper; each left quietly and\nwent to New York, and from New York to Philadelphia, as a journeyman\nprinter; each in due season became a world figure, many-sided, human, and\nof incredible popularity.",
        "Orion Clemens, meantime, had bought a paper in Muscatine, Iowa, and\nlocated the family there.  Evidently by this time he had realized the\nvalue of his brother as a contributor, for Sam, in a letter to Orion,\nsays, “I will try to write for the paper occasionally, but I fear my\nletters will be very uninteresting, for this incessant night work dulls\none’s ideas amazingly.”",
        "Meantime, he had passed his eighteenth birthday, winter was coming on, he\nhad been away from home half a year, and the first attack of homesickness\nwas due.  “One only has to leave home to learn how to write interesting\nletters to an absent friend,” he wrote; and again.  “I don’t like our\npresent prospect for cold weather at all.”",
        "He declared he only wanted to get back to avoid night work, which was\ninjuring his eyes, but we may guess there was a stronger reason, which\nperhaps he did not entirely realize.  The novelty of wandering had worn\noff, and he yearned for familiar faces, the comfort of those he loved.",
        "But he did not go.  He made a trip to Washington in January–a sight-\nseeing trip–returning to Philadelphia, where he worked for the “Ledger\"\nand “North American.”  Eventually he went back to New York, and from\nthere took ticket to St. Louis.  This was in the late summer of 1854; he\nhad been fifteen months away from his people when he stepped aboard the\ntrain to return.",
        "Sam was worn out when he reached St. Louis; but the Keokuk packet was\nleaving, and he stopped only long enough to see Pamela, then went aboard\nand, flinging himself into his berth, did not waken until the boat\nreached Muscatine, Iowa, thirty-six hours later.",
        "It was very early when he arrived, too early to rouse the family.  He sat\ndown in the office of a little hotel to wait for morning, and picked up a\nsmall book that lay on the writing-table.  It contained pictures of the\nEnglish rulers with the brief facts of their reigns.  Sam Clemens\nentertained himself learning these data by heart.  He had a fine memory\nfor such things, and in an hour or two had those details so perfectly\ncommitted that he never forgot one of them as long as he lived.  The\nknowledge acquired in this stray fashion he found invaluable in later\nlife.  It was his groundwork for all English history.",
        "Orion could not persuade his brother to remain in Muscatine.  Sam\nreturned to his old place on the “Evening News,” in St. Louis, where he\nremained until the following year, rooming with a youth named Burrough, a\njourneyman chair-maker with literary taste, a reader of the English\nclassics, a companionable lad, and for Samuel Clemens a good influence.",
        "By spring, Orion Clemens had married and had sold out in Muscatine.  He\nwas now located in Keokuk, Iowa.  When presently Brother Sam came\nvisiting to Keokuk, Orion offered him five dollars a week and his board\nto remain.  He accepted.  Henry Clemens, now seventeen, was also in\nOrion’s employ, and a lad named Dick Hingham.  Henry and Sam slept in the\noffice; Dick and a young fellow named Brownell, who roomed above, came in\nfor social evenings.",
        "They were pretty lively evenings.  A music-teacher on the floor below did\nnot care for them–they disturbed his class.  He was furious, in fact,\nand assailed the boys roughly at first, with no result but to make\nmatters worse.  Then he tried gentleness, and succeeded.  The boys\nstopped their capers and joined his class.  Sam, especially, became a\ndistinguished member of that body.  He was never a great musician, but\nwith his good nature, his humor, his slow, quaint speech and originality,\nhe had no rival in popularity.  He was twenty now, and much with young\nladies, yet he was always a beau rather than a suitor, a good comrade to\nall, full of pranks and pleasantries, ready to stop and be merry with any\nthat came along.  If they prophesied concerning his future, it is not\nlikely that they spoke of literary fame.  They thought him just easy-\ngoing and light-minded.  True, they noticed that he often carried a book\nunder his arm–a history, a volume of Dickens, or the tales of Poe.",
        "He read more than any one guessed.  At night, propped up in bed–a habit\ncontinued until his death–he was likely to read until a late hour.  He\nenjoyed smoking at such times, and had made himself a pipe with a large\nbowl which stood on the floor and had a long rubber stem, something like\nthe Turkish hubble-bubble.  He liked to fill the big bowl and smoke at\nease through the entire evening.  But sometimes the pipe went out, which\nmeant that he must strike a match and lean far over to apply it, just\nwhen he was most comfortable.  Sam Clemens never liked unnecessary\nexertion.  One night, when the pipe had gone out for the second time, he\nhappened to hear the young book-clerk, Brownell, passing up to his room\non the top floor.  Sam called to him:",
        "“Ed, come here!”",
        "Brownell poked his head in the door.  The two were great chums.",
        "“What will you have, Sam?” he asked.",
        "“Come in, Ed; Henry’s asleep, and I’m in trouble.  I want somebody to\nlight my pipe.”",
        "“Why don’t you light it yourself?” Brownell asked.",
        "“I would, only I knew you’d be along in a few minutes and would do it for\nme.”",
        "Brownell scratched a match, stooped down, and applied it.",
        "“What are you reading, Sam?”",
        "“Oh, nothing much–a so-called funny book.  One of these days I’ll write\na funnier book myself.”",
        "Brownell laughed.  “No, you won’t, Sam,” he said.  “You’re too lazy ever\nto write a book.”",
        "Years later, in the course of a lecture which he delivered in Keokuk,\nMark Twain said that he supposed the most untruthful man in the world\nlived right there in Keokuk, and that his name was Ed Brownell.",
        "Orion Clemens did not have the gift of prosperity, and his printing-\noffice did not flourish.  When he could no longer pay Sam’s wages he took\nhim into partnership, which meant that Sam got no wages at all, though\nthis was of less consequence, since his mother, now living with Pamela,\nwas well provided for.  The disorder of the office, however, distressed\nhim.  He wrote home that he could not work without system, and, a little\nlater, that he was going to leave Keokuk, that, in fact, he was planning\na great adventure–a trip to the upper Amazon!",
        "His interest in the Amazon had been awakened by a book.  Lynch and\nHerndon had surveyed the upper river, and Lieutenant Herndon’s book was\nwidely read.  Sam Clemens, propped up in bed, pored over it through long\nevenings, and nightly made fabulous fortunes collecting cocoa and other\nrare things–resolving, meantime, to start in person for the upper Amazon\nwith no unnecessary delay.  Boy and man, Samuel Clemens was the same.\nHis vision of grand possibilities ahead blinded him to the ways and means\nof arrival.  It was an inheritance from both sides of his parentage.\nOnce, in old age, he wrote:",
        "“I have been punished many and many a time, and bitterly, for doing\n     things and reflecting afterward .  .  .  .  When I am reflecting on\n     these occasions, even deaf persons can hear me think.”",
        "He believed, however, that he had reflected carefully concerning the\nAmazon, and that in a brief time he should be there at the head of an\nexpedition, piling up untold wealth.  He even stirred the imaginations of\ntwo other adventurers, a Dr. Martin and a young man named Ward.  To\nHenry, then in St. Louis, he wrote, August 5, 1856:",
        "“Ward and I held a long consultation Sunday morning, and the result\n     was that we two have determined to start to Brazil, if possible, in\n     six weeks from now, in order to look carefully into matters there\n     and report to Dr. Martin in time for him to follow on the first of\n     March.”",
        "The matter of finance troubled him.  Orion could not be depended on for\nany specified sum, and the fare to the upper Amazon would probably be\nconsiderable.  Sam planned different methods of raising it.  One of them\nwas to go to New York or Cincinnati and work at his trade until he saved\nthe amount.  He would then sail from New York direct, or take boat for\nNew Orleans and sail from there.  Of course there would always be vessels\nclearing for the upper Amazon.  After Lieutenant Herndon’s book the ocean\nwould probably be full of them.",
        "He did not make the start with Ward, as planned, and Ward and Martin seem\nto have given up the Amazon idea.  Not so with Samuel Clemens.  He went\non reading Herndon, trying meantime to raise money enough to get him out\nof Keokuk.  Was it fate or Providence that suddenly placed it in his\nhands?  Whatever it was, the circumstance is so curious that it must be\nclassed as one of those strange facts that have no place in fiction.",
        "The reader will remember how, one day in Hannibal, the wind had brought\nto Sam Clemens, then printer’s apprentice, a stray leaf from a book about\n\"Joan of Arc,” and how that incident marked a turning-point in his mental\nlife.  Now, seven years later, it was the wind again that directed his\nfortune.  It was a day in early November–bleak, bitter, and\ngusty, with whirling snow; most persons were indoors.  Samuel Clemens,\ngoing down Main Street, Keokuk, saw a flying bit of paper pass him and\nlodge against a building.  Something about it attracted him and he\ncaptured it.  It was a fifty-dollar bill!  He had never seen one before,\nbut he recognized it.  He thought he must be having a pleasant dream.",
        "He was tempted to pocket his good fortune and keep still.  But he had\nalways a troublesome conscience.  He went to a newspaper office and\nadvertised that he had found a sum of money, a large bill.",
        "Once, long after, he said: “I didn’t describe it very particularly, and I\nwaited in daily fear that the owner would turn up and take away my\nfortune.  By and by I couldn’t stand it any longer.  My conscience had\ngotten all that was coming to it.  I felt that I must take that money out\nof danger.”",
        "Another time he said, “I advertised the find and left for the Amazon the\nsame day.”  All of which we may take with his usual literary discount–\nthe one assigned to him by his mother in childhood.  As a matter of fact,\nhe remained for an ample time, and nobody came for the money.  What was\nits origin?  Was it swept out of a bank, or caught up by the wind from\nsome counting-room table?  Perhaps it materialized out of the unseen.\nWho knows?",
        "Sam decided on Cincinnati as his base.  From there he could go either to\nNew York or New Orleans to catch the Amazon boat.  He paid a visit to St.\nLouis, where his mother made him renew his promise as to drink and cards.\nThen he was seized with a literary idea, and returned to Keokuk, where he\nproposed to a thriving weekly paper, the “Saturday Post,” to send letters\nof travel, which might even be made into a book later on.  George Reese,\nowner of the “Post,” agreed to pay five dollars each for the letters,\nwhich speaks well for his faith in Samuel Clemens’s talent, five dollars\nbeing good pay for that time and place–more than the letters were worth,\njudged by present standards.  The first was dated Cincinnati, November\n14, 1856, and was certainly not promising literature.  It was written in\nthe ridiculous dialect which was once thought to be the dress of humor;\nand while here and there is a comic flash, there is in it little promise\nof the future Mark Twain.  One extract is enough:",
        "“When we got to the depo’, I went around to git a look at the iron\n     hoss.  Thunderation!  It wasn’t no more like a hoss than a meetin’-\n     house.  If I was goin’ to describe the animule, I’d say it looked\n     like–well, it looked like–blamed if I know what it looked like,\n     snorting fire and brimstone out of his nostrils, and puffin’ out\n     black smoke all ’round, and pantin’, and heavin’, and swellin’, and\n     chawin’ up red-hot coals like they was good.  A feller stood in a\n     little house like, feedin’ him all the time; but the more he got,\n     the more he wanted and the more he blowed and snorted.  After a\n     spell the feller ketched him by the tail, and great Jericho! he set\n     up a yell that split the ground for more’n a mile and a half, and\n     the next minit I felt my legs a-waggin’, and found myself at t’other\n     end of the string o’ vehickles.  I wasn’t skeered, but I had three\n     chills and a stroke of palsy in less than five minits, and my face\n     had a cur’us brownish-yaller-greenbluish color in it, which was\n     perfectly unaccountable.  ’Well,’ say I, ’comment is super-flu-ous.’”",
        "How Samuel Clemens could have written that, and worse, at twenty-one, and\na little more than ten years later have written “The Innocents Abroad,\"\nis one of the mysteries of literature.  The letters were signed\n\"Snodgrass,” and there are but two of them.  Snodgrass seems to have\nfound them hard work, for it is said he raised on the price, which,\nfortunately, brought the series to a close.  Their value to-day lies in\nthe fact that they are the earliest of Mark Twain’s newspaper\ncontributions that have been preserved–the first for which he received a\ncash return.",
        "Sam remained in Cincinnati until April of the following year, 1857,\nworking for Wrightson & Co., general printers, lodging in a cheap\nboarding-house, saving every possible penny for his great adventure.",
        "He had one associate at the boarding-house, a lank, unsmiling Scotchman\nnamed Macfarlane, twice young Clemens’s age, and a good deal of a\nmystery.  Sam never could find out what Macfarlane did.  His hands were\nhardened by some sort of heavy labor; he left at six in the morning and\nreturned in the evening at the same hour.  He never mentioned his work,\nand young Clemens had the delicacy not to inquire.",
        "For Macfarlane was no ordinary person.  He was a man of deep knowledge, a\nreader of many books, a thinker; he was versed in history and philosophy,\nhe knew the dictionary by heart.  He made but two statements concerning\nhimself: one, that he had acquired his knowledge from reading, and not at\nschool; the other, that he knew every word in the English dictionary.  He\nwas willing to give proof of the last, and Sam Clemens tested him more\nthan once, but found no word that Macfarlane could not define.",
        "Macfarlane was not silent–he would discuss readily enough the deeper\nproblems of life and had many startling theories of his own.  Darwin had\nnot yet published his “Descent of Man,” yet Macfarlane was already\nadvancing ideas similar to those in that book.  He went further than\nDarwin.  He had startling ideas of the moral evolution of man, and these\nhe would pour into the ears of his young listener until ten o’clock,\nafter which, like the English Sumner in Philadelphia, he would grill a\nherring, and the evening would end.  Those were fermenting discourses\nthat young Samuel Clemens listened to that winter in Macfarlane’s room,\nand they did not fail to influence his later thought.",
        "It was the high-tide of spring, late in April, when the prospective\ncocoa-hunter decided that it was time to set out for the upper Amazon.\nHe had saved money enough to carry him at least as far as New Orleans,\nwhere he would take ship, it being farther south and therefore nearer his\ndestination.  Furthermore, he could begin with a lazy trip down the\nMississippi, which, next to being a pilot, had been one of his most\ncherished dreams.  The Ohio River steamers were less grand than those of\nthe Mississippi, but they had a homelike atmosphere and did not hurry.\nSamuel Clemens had the spring fever and was willing to take his time.",
        "In “Life on the Mississippi” we read that the author ran away, vowing\nnever to return until he could come home a pilot, shedding glory.  But\nthis is the fiction touch.  He had always loved the river, and his\nboyhood dream of piloting had time and again returned, but it was not\nuppermost when he bade good-by to Macfarlane and stepped aboard the “Paul\nJones,” bound for New Orleans, and thus conferred immortality on that\nancient little craft.",
        "Now he had really started on his voyage.  But it was a voyage that would\ncontinue not for a week or a fortnight, but for four years–four\nmarvelous, sunlit years, the glory of which would color all that followed\nthem.",
        "A reader of Mark Twain’s Mississippi book gets the impression that the\nauthor was a boy of about seventeen when he started to learn the river,\nand that he was painfully ignorant of the great task ahead.  But this\nalso is the fiction side of the story.  Samuel Clemens was more than\ntwenty-one when he set out on the “Paul Jones,” and in a way was familiar\nwith the trade of piloting.  Hannibal had turned out many pilots.  An\nolder brother of the Bowen boys was already on the river when Sam Clemens\nwas rolling rocks down Holliday’s Hill.  Often he came home to air his\ngrandeur and hold forth on the wonder of his work.  That learning the\nriver was no light task Sam Clemens would know as well as any one who had\nnot tried it.",
        "Nevertheless, as the drowsy little steamer went puffing down into softer,\nsunnier lands, the old dream, the “permanent ambition” of boyhood,\nreturned, while the call of the far-off Amazon and cocoa drew faint.",
        "Horace Bixby,[2] pilot of the “Paul Jones,” a man of thirty-two, was\nlooking out over the bow at the head of Island No. 35 when he heard a\nslow, pleasant voice say, “Good morning.”",
        "Bixby was a small, clean-cut man.  “Good morning, sir,” he said, rather\nbriskly, without looking around.",
        "He did not much care for visitors in the pilothouse.  This one entered\nand stood a little behind him.",
        "“How would you like a young man to learn the river?” came to him in that\nserene, deliberate speech.",
        "The pilot glanced over his shoulder and saw a rather slender, loose-\nlimbed youth with a fair, girlish complexion and a great mass of curly\nauburn hair.",
        "“I wouldn’t like it.  Cub pilots are more trouble than they’re worth.  A\ngreat deal more trouble than profit.”",
        "“I am a printer by trade,” the easy voice went on.  “It doesn’t agree\nwith me.  I thought I’d go to South America.”",
        "Bixby kept his eye on the river, but there was interest in his voice when\nhe spoke.  “What makes you pull your words that way?” he asked–\"pulling\"\nbeing the river term for drawling.",
        "The young man, now seated comfortably on the visitors’ bench, said more\nslowly than ever: “You’ll have to ask my mother–she pulls hers, too.”",
        "Pilot Bixby laughed.  The manner of the reply amused him.  His guest was\nencouraged.",
        "“Do you know the Bowen boys?” he asked, “pilots in the St. Louis and New\nOrleans trade?”",
        "“I know them well–all three of them.  William Bowen did his first\nsteering for me; a mighty good boy.  I know Sam, too, and Bart.”",
        "“Old schoolmates of mine in Hannibal.  Sam and Will, especially, were my\nchums.”",
        "Bixby’s tone became friendly.  “Come over and stand by me,” he said.\n\"What is your name?”",
        "The applicant told him, and the two stood looking out on the sunlit\nwater.",
        "“Do you drink?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“Do you gamble?”",
        "“No, sir.”",
        "“Do you swear?”",
        "“N-not for amusement; only under pressure.”",
        "“Do you chew?”",
        "“No, sir, never; but I must–smoke.”",
        "“Did you ever do any steering?”",
        "“I have steered everything on the river but a steamboat, I guess.”",
        "“Very well.  Take the wheel and see what you can do with a steamboat.\nKeep her as she is–toward that lower cottonwood snag.”",
        "Bixby had a sore foot and was glad of a little relief.  He sat on the\nbench where he could keep a careful eye on the course.  By and by he said\n\"There is just one way I would take a young man to learn the river–that\nis, for money.”",
        "“What–do you–charge?”",
        "“Five hundred dollars, and I to be at no expense whatever.”",
        "In those days pilots were allowed to carry a learner, or “cub,” board\nfree.  Mr. Bixby meant that he was to be at no expense in port or for\nincidentals.  His terms seemed discouraging.",
        "“I haven’t got five hundred dollars in money,” Sam said.  “I’ve got a lot\nof Tennessee land worth two bits an acre.  I’ll give you two thousand\nacres of that.”",
        "Bixby shook his head.  “No,” he said, “I don’t want any unimproved real\nestate.  I have too much already.”",
        "Sam reflected.  He thought he might be able to borrow one hundred dollars\nfrom William Moffett, Pamela’s husband, without straining his credit.",
        "“Well, then,” he proposed, “I’ll give you one hundred dollars cash, and\nthe rest when I earn it.”",
        "Something about this young man had won Horace Bixby’s heart.  His slow,\npleasant speech, his unhurried, quiet manner at the wheel, his evident\nsimplicity and sincerity–the inner qualities of mind and heart which\nwould make the world love Mark Twain.  The terms proposed were accepted.\nThe first payment was to be in cash; the others were to begin when the\npupil had learned the river and was earning wages.  During the rest of\nthe trip to New Orleans the new pupil was often at the wheel, while Mr.\nBixby nursed his sore foot and gave directions.  Any literary ambitions\nthat Samuel Clemens still nourished waned rapidly.  By the time he had\nreached New Orleans he had almost forgotten he had ever been a printer.\nAs for the Amazon and cocoa, why, there had been no ship sailing in that\ndirection for years, and it was unlikely that any would ever sail again,\na fact that rather amused the would-be adventurer now, since Providence\nhad regulated his affairs in accordance with his oldest and longest\ncherished dream.",
        "At New Orleans Bixby left the “Paul Jones” for a fine St. Louis boat,\ntaking his cub with him.  This was a sudden and happy change, and Sam was\na good deal impressed with his own importance in belonging to so imposing\na structure, especially when, after a few days’ stay in New Orleans, he\nstood by Bixby’s side in the big glass turret while they backed out of\nthe line of wedged-in boats and headed up the great river.",
        "This was glory, but there was sorrow ahead.  He had not really begun\nlearning the river as yet he had only steered under directions.  He had\nknown that to learn the river would be hard, but he had never realized\nquite how hard.  Serenely he had undertaken the task of mastering twelve\nhundred miles of the great, changing, shifting river as exactly and as\nsurely by daylight or darkness as one knows the way to his own features.\nNobody could realize the full size of that task–not till afterward.",
        "[2] Horace Bixby lived until 1912 and remained at the wheel until within\na short time of his death, in his eighty-seventh year.  The writer of\nthis memoir visited him in 1910 and took down from his dictation the\ndialogue that follows.",
        "In that early day, to be a pilot was to be “greater than a king.”  The\nMississippi River pilot was a law unto himself–there was none above him.\nHis direction of the boat was absolute; he could start or lay up when he\nchose; he could pass a landing regardless of business there, consulting\nnobody, not even the captain; he could take the boat into what seemed\ncertain destruction, if he had that mind, and the captain was obliged to\nstand by, helpless and silent, for the law was with the pilot in\neverything.",
        "Furthermore, the pilot was a gentleman.  His work was clean and\nphysically light.  It ended the instant the boat was tied to the landing,\nand did not begin again until it was ready to back into the stream.\nAlso, for those days his salary was princely–the Vice-President of the\nUnited States did not receive more.  As for prestige, the Mississippi\npilot, perched high in his glass inclosure, fashionably dressed, and\ncommanding all below him, was the most conspicuous and showy, the most\nobserved and envied creature in the world.  No wonder Sam Clemens, with\nhis love of the river and his boyish fondness for honors, should aspire\nto that stately rank.  Even at twenty-one he was still just a boy–as,\nindeed, he was till his death–and we may imagine how elated he was,\nstarting up the great river as a real apprentice pilot, who in a year or\ntwo would stand at the wheel, as his chief was now standing, a monarch\nwith a splendid income and all the great river packed away in his head.",
        "In that last item lay the trouble.  In the Mississippi book he tells of\nit in a way that no one may hope to equal, and if the details are not\nexact, the truth is there–at least in substance.",
        "For a distance above New Orleans Mr. Bixby had volunteered information\nabout the river, naming the points and crossings, in what seemed a casual\nway, all through his watch of four hours.  Their next watch began in the\nmiddle of the night, and Mark Twain tells how surprised and disgusted he\nwas to learn that pilots must get up in the night to run their boats, and\nhis amazement to find Mr. Bixby plunging into the blackness ahead as if\nit had been daylight.  Very likely this is mainly fiction, but hardly the\nfollowing:",
        "     Presently he turned to me and said: “What’s the name of the first\n     point above New Orleans?”",
        "     I was gratified to be able to answer promptly, and I did.  I said I\n     didn’t know.",
        "     “Don’t know!”",
        "     His manner jolted me.  I was down at the foot again, in a moment.\n     But I had to say just what I had said before.",
        "     “Well, you’re a smart one,” said Mr. Bixby.  “What’s the name of the\n     next point?”",
        "     Once more I didn’t know.",
        "     “Well, this beats anything!  Tell me the name of any point or place\n     I told you.”",
        "     I studied awhile and decided that I couldn’t.",

        "     “I–I–Nothing, for certain.”",
        "     Bixby was a small, nervous man, hot and quick-firing.  He went off\n     now, and said a number of severe things.  Then:",
        "     “Look here, what do you suppose I told you the names of those points\n     for?”",

        "     This was a red flag to the bull.  He raged and stormed so (he was\n     crossing the river at the time) that I judged it made him blind,\n     because he ran over the steering-oar of a trading-scow.  Of course\n     the traders sent up a volley of red-hot profanity.  Never was a man\n     so grateful as Mr. Bixby was, because he was brimful, and here were\n     subjects who would talk back.  He threw open a window, thrust his\n     head out, and such an irruption followed as I had never heard before\n     .  .  .  . When he closed the window he was empty.  Presently he\n     said to me, in the gentlest way:",
        "     “My boy, you must get a little memorandum-book, and every time I\n     tell you a thing, put it down right away.  There’s only one way to\n     be a pilot, and that is to get this entire river by heart.  You have\n     to know it just like A-B-C.”",
        "The little memorandum-book which Sam Clemens bought, probably at the next\ndaylight landing, still exists–the same that he says “fairly bristled\nwith the names of towns, points, bars, islands, bends, reaches, etc.\";\nbut it made his heart ache to think he had only half the river set down,\nfor, as the watches were four hours off and four hours on, there were the\nlong gaps where he had slept.",

        "The average mind would not hold a single one of these notes ten seconds,\nyet by the time he reached St. Louis he had set down pages that to-day\nmake one’s head weary even to contemplate.  And those long four-hour gaps\nwhere he had been asleep–they are still there; and now, after nearly\nsixty years, the old heartache is still in them.  He must have bought a\nnew book for the next trip and laid this one away.",
        "To the new “cub” it seemed a long way to St. Louis that first trip, but\nin the end it was rather grand to come steaming up to the big, busy city,\nwith its thronging waterfront flanked with a solid mile of steamboats,\nand to nose one’s way to a place in that stately line.",
        "At St. Louis, Sam borrowed from his brother-in-law the one hundred\ndollars he had agreed to pay, and so closed his contract with Bixby.  A\nfew days later his chief was engaged to go on a very grand boat indeed–a\n\"sumptuous temple,” he tells us, all brass and inlay, with a pilot-house\nso far above the water that he seemed perched on a mountain.  This part\nof learning the river was worth while; and when he found that the\nregiment of natty servants respectfully “sir’d” him, his happiness was\ncomplete.",
        "But he was in the depths again, presently, for when they started down the\nriver and he began to take account of his knowledge, he found that he had\nnone.  Everything had changed–that is, he was seeing it all from the\nother direction.  What with the four-hour gaps and this transformation,\nhe was lost completely.",
        "How could the easy-going, dreamy, unpractical man whom the world knew as\nMark Twain ever have persisted against discouragement like that to\nacquire the vast, the absolute, limitless store of information necessary\nto Mississippi piloting?  The answer is that he loved the river, the\npicturesqueness and poetry of a steamboat, the ease and glory of a\npilot’s life; and then, in spite of his own later claims to the contrary,\nSamuel Clemens, boy and man, in the work suited to his tastes and gifts,\nwas the most industrious of persons.  Work of the other sort he avoided,\noverlooked, refused to recognize, but never any labor for which he was\nqualified by his talents or training.  Piloting suited him exactly, and\nhe proved an apt pupil.",

That Samuel Clemens had the courage\nto continue is the best proof, not only of his great love of the river,\nbut of that splendid gift of resolution that one rarely fails to find in\nmen of the foremost rank.",

        "Piloting was only a part of Sam Clemens’s education on the Mississippi.\nHe learned as much of the reefs and shallows of human nature as of the\nriver-bed.  In one place he writes:",
        "In that brief, sharp schooling I got personally and familiarly\n     acquainted with all the different types of human nature that are to\n     be found in fiction, biography, or history.",
        "All the different types, but most of them in the rough.  That Samuel\nClemens kept the promise made to his mother as to drink and cards during\nthose apprentice days is well worth remembering.",
        "Horace Bixby, answering a call for pilots from the Missouri River,\nconsigned his pupil, as was customary, tonne of the pilots of the “John\nJ. Roe,” a freight-boat, owned and conducted by some retired farmers, and\nin its hospitality reminding Sam of his Uncle John Quarles’s farm.  The\n\"Roe” was a very deliberate boat.  It was said that she could beat an\nisland to St. Louis, but never quite overtake the current going down-\nstream.  Sam loved the “Roe.”  She was not licensed to carry passengers,\nbut she always had a family party of the owners’ relations aboard, and\nthere was a big deck for dancing and a piano in the cabin.  The young\npilot could play the chords, and sing, in his own fashion, about a\ngrasshopper that; sat on a sweet-potato vine, and about–",
        "An old, old horse whose name was Methusalem,\nTook him down and sold him in Jerusalem,\nA long time ago.",
        "The “Roe” was a heavenly place, but Sam’s stay there did not last.  Bixby\ncame down from the Missouri, and perhaps thought he was doing a fine\nthing for his pupil by transferring him to a pilot named Brown, then on a\nlarge passenger-steamer, the “Pennsylvania.”  The “Pennsylvania” was new\nand one of the finest boats on the river.  Sam Clemens, by this time, was\naccounted a good steersman, so it seemed fortunate and a good arrangement\nfor all parties.",
        "But Brown was a tyrant.  He was illiterate and coarse, and took a dislike\nto Sam from the start.  His first greeting was a question, harmless\nenough in form but offensive in manner.",
        "“Are you Horace Bigsby’s cub?\"–Bixby being usually pronounced “Bigsby\"\nin river parlance.",
        "Sam answered politely enough that he was, and Brown proceeded to comment\non the “style” of his clothes and other personal matters.",
        "He had made an effort to please Brown, but it was no use.  Brown was\nnever satisfied.  At a moment when Sam was steering, Brown, sitting on\nthe bench, would shout: “Here!  Where are you going now?  Pull her down!\nPull her down!  Do you hear me?  Blamed mud-cat!”",
        "The young pilot soon learned to detest his chief, and presently was\nputting in a good deal of his time inventing punishments for him.",
        "I could imagine myself killing Brown; there was no law against that, and\nthat was the thing I always used to do the moment I was abed.  Instead of\ngoing over the river in my mind, as was my duty, I threw business aside\nfor pleasure, and killed Brown.",
        "He gave up trying to please Brown, and was even willing to stir him up\nupon occasion.  One day when the cub was at the wheel his chief noticed\nthat the course seemed peculiar.",
        "“Here!  Where you headin’ for now?” he yelled.  “What in the nation you\nsteerin’ at, anyway?  Blamed numskull!”",
        "“Why,” said Sam in his calm, slow way, “I didn’t see much else I could\nsteer for, so I was heading for that white heifer on the bank.”",
        "“Get away from that wheel!  And get outen this pilot-house!” yelled\nBrown.  “You ain’t fitten to become no pilot!”  An order that Sam found\nwelcome enough.  The other pilot, George Ealer, was a lovable soul who\nplayed the flute and chess during his off watch, and read aloud to Sam\nfrom “Goldsmith” and “Shakespeare.”  To be with George Ealer was to\nforget the persecutions of Brown.",
        "Young Clemens had been on the river nearly a year at this time, and,\nthough he had learned a good deal and was really a fine steersman, he\nreceived no wages.  He had no board to pay, but there were things he must\nbuy, and his money supply had become limited.  Each trip of the\n\"Pennsylvania” she remained about two days and nights in New Orleans,\nduring which time the young man was free.  He found he could earn two and\na half to three dollars a night watching freight on the levee, and, as\nthis opportunity came around about once a month, the amount was useful.\nNor was this the only return; many years afterward he said:",
        "“It was a desolate experience, watching there in the dark, among\n     those piles of freight; not a sound, not a living creature astir.\n     But it was not a profitless one.  I used to have inspirations as I\n     sat there alone those nights.  I used to imagine all sots of\n     situations and possibilities.  These things got into my books by and\n     by, and furnished me with many a chapter.  I can trace the effects\n     of those nights through most of my books, in one way and another.”",
        "Piloting, even with Brown, had its pleasant side.  In St. Louis, young\nClemens stopped with his sister, and often friends were there from\nHannibal.  At both ends of the line he visited friendly boats, especially\nthe “Roe,” where a grand welcome was always waiting.  Once among the\nguests of that boat a young girl named Laura so attracted him that he\nforgot time and space until one of the “Roe” pilots, Zeb Leavenworth,\ncame flying aft, shouting:",
        "“The “Pennsylvania” is backing out!”",
        "A hasty good-by, a wild flight across the decks of several boats, and a\nleap across several feet of open water closed the episode.  He wrote to\nLaura, but there was no reply.  He never saw her again, never heard from\nher for nearly fifty years, when both were widowed and old.  She had not\nreceived his letter.",
        "Occasionally there were stirring adventures aboard the “Pennsylvania.\"\nIn a letter written in March, 1858, the young pilot tells of an exciting\nnight search in the running ice for Hat Island soundings:",
        "Brown, the pilot, stood in the bow with an oar, to keep her head out, and\nI took the tiller.  We would start the men, and all would go well until\nthe yawl would bring us on a heavy cake of ice, and then the men would\ndrop like so many tenpins, while Brown assumed the horizontal in the\nbottom of the boat.  After an hour’s hard work we got back, with ice half\nan inch thick on the oars .  .  .  .  The next day was colder still.  I\nwas out in the yawl twice, and then we got through, but the infernal\nsteamboat came near running over us .  .  .  .  The “Maria Denning” was\naground at the head of the island; they hailed us; we ran alongside, and\nthey hoisted us in and thawed us out.  We had been out in the yawl from\nfour in the morning until half-past nine without being near a fire.\nThere was a thick coating of ice over men and yawl, ropes, and\neverything, and we looked like rock-candy statuary.",
        "He was at the right age to enjoy such adventures, and to feel a pride in\nthem.  In the same letter he tells how he found on the “Pennsylvania” a\nsmall clerkship for his brother Henry, who was now nearly twenty, a\nhandsome, gentle boy of whom Sam was lavishly fond and proud.  The young\npilot was eager to have Henry with him–to see him started in life. How\nlittle he dreamed what sorrow would come of his well-meant efforts in the\nlad’s behalf!  Yet he always believed, later, that he had a warning, for\none night at the end of May, in St. Louis, he had a vivid dream, which\ntime would presently fulfil.",
        "An incident now occurred on the “Pennsylvania” that closed Samuel\nClemens’s career on that boat.  It was the down trip, and the boat was in\nEagle Bend when Henry Clemens appeared on the hurricane deck with an\nannouncement from the captain of a landing a little lower down.  Brown,\nwho would never own that he was rather deaf, probably misunderstood the\norder.  They were passing the landing when the captain appeared on the\ndeck.",
        "“Didn’t Henry tell you to land here?” he called to Brown.",
        "“No, sir.”",
        "Captain Klinefelter turned to Sam.  “Didn’t you hear him?”",
        "“Yes, sir!”",
        "Brown said: “Shut your mouth!  You never heard anything of the kind!”",
        "Henry appeared, not suspecting any trouble.",
        "Brown said, fiercely, “Here, why didn’t you tell me we had got to land at\nthat plantation?”",
        "“I did tell you, Mr. Brown,” Henry said, politely.",
        "“It’s a lie!”",
        "Sam Clemens could stand Brown’s abuse of himself, but not of Henry.  He\nsaid: “You lie yourself.  He did tell you!”",
        "For a cub pilot to defy his chief was unheard of.  Brown was dazed, then\nhe shouted:",
        "“I’ll attend to your case in half a minute!”  And to Henry, “Get out of\nhere!”",
        "Henry had started when Brown seized him by the collar and struck him in\nthe face.  An instant later Sam was upon Brown with a heavy stool and\nstretched him on the floor.  Then all the repressed fury of months broke\nloose; and, leaping upon Brown and holding him down with his knees,\nSamuel Clemens pounded the tyrant with his fists till his strength gave\nout.  He let Brown go then, and the latter, with pilot instinct, sprang\nto the wheel, for the boat was drifting.  Seeing she was safe, he seized\na spy-glass as a weapon and ordered his chastiser out of the pilot-house.\nBut Sam lingered.  He had become very calm, and he openly corrected\nBrown’s English.",
        "“Don’t give me none of your airs!” yelled Brown.  “I ain’t goin’ to stand\nnothin’ more from you!”",
        "“You should say, `Don’t give me any of your airs,’” Sam said, sweetly,\n\"and the last half of your sentence almost defies correction.”",
        "A group of passengers and white-aproned servants, assembled on the deck\nforward, applauded the victor.  Sam went down to find Captain\nKlinefelter.  He expected to be put in irons, for it was thought to be\nmutiny to strike a pilot.",
        "The captain took Sam into his private room and made some inquiries.  Mark\nTwain, in the “Mississippi” boot remembers them as follows:",
        "“Did you strike him first?” Captain Klinefelter asked.",
        "“Yes, sir.”",
        "“What with?”",
        "“A stool, sir.”",
        "“Hard?”",
        "“Middling, sir.”",
        "“Did it knock him down?”",
        "“He–he fell, sir.”",
        "“Did you follow it up?  Did you do anything further?”",
        "“Yes, sir.”",
        "“What did you do?”",
        "“Pounded him, sir.”",
        "“Pounded him?”",
        "“Yes, sir.”",
        "“Did you pound him much–that is, severely?”",
        "“One might call it that, sir, maybe.”",
        "“I am mighty glad of it!  Hark ye–never mention that I said that!  You\nhave been guilty of a great crime; and don’t ever be guilty of it again\non this boat, but–lay for him ashore!  Give him a good, sound thrashing,\ndo you hear?  I’ll pay the expenses.”",
        "In a letter which Samuel Clemens wrote to Orion’s wife, immediately after\nthis incident, he gives the details of the encounter with Brown and\nspeaks of Captain Klinefelter’s approval.[4]  Brown declared he would\nleave the boat at New Orleans if Sam Clemens remained on it, and the\ncaptain told him to go, offering to let Sam himself run the daylight\nwatches back to St. Louis, thus showing his faith in the young steersman.\nThe “cub,” however, had less confidence, and advised that Brown be kept\nfor the up trip, saying he would follow by the next boat.  It was a\ndecision that probably saved his life.",
        "That night, watching on the levee, Henry joined him, when his own duties\nwere finished, and the brothers made the round together.  It may have\nbeen some memory of his dream that made Samuel Clemens say:",
        "“Henry, in case of accident, whatever you do, don’t lose your head–the\npassengers will do that.  Rush for the hurricane-deck and to the life-\nboat, and obey the mate’s orders.  When the boat is launched, help the\nwomen and children into it.  Don’t get in yourself.  The river is only a\nmile wide.  You can swim ashore easily enough.”",
        "It was good, manly advice, but a long grief lay behind it.",
        "[4] In the Mississippi book the author says that Brown was about to\nstrike Henry with a lump of coal, but in the letter above mentioned the\ndetails are as here given.",
        "The “A. T. Lacy,” that brought Samuel Clemens up the river, was two days\nbehind the “Pennsylvania.”  At Greenville, Mississippi, a voice from\nthe landing shouted “The “Pennsylvania” is blown up just below Memphis,\nat Ship Island.  One hundred and fifty lives lost!”",
        "It proved a true report.  At six o’clock that warm mid-June morning,\nwhile loading wood, sixty miles below Memphis, four out of eight of the\nPennsylvania’s boilers had suddenly exploded, with fearful results.\nHenry Clemens had been one of the victims.  He had started to swim for\nthe shore, only a few hundred yards away, but had turned back to assist\nin the rescue of others.  What followed could not be clearly learned.  He\nwas terribly injured, and died on the fourth night after the catastrophe.\nHis brother was with him by that time, and believed he recognized the\nexact fulfilment of his dream.",
        "The young pilot’s grief was very great.  In a letter home he spoke of the\ndying boy as “My darling, my pride, my glory, my all.”  His heavy sorrow,\nand the fact that with unsparing self-blame he held himself in a measure\nresponsible for his brother’s tragic death, saddened his early life.  His\nearly gaiety came back, but his face had taken on the serious, pathetic\nlook which from that time it always wore in repose.  Less than twenty-\nthree, he had suddenly the look of thirty, and while Samuel Clemens in\nspirit, temperament, and features never would become really old, neither\nwould he ever look really young again.",
        "He returned to the river as steersman for George Ealer, whom he loved,\nand in September of that year obtained a full license as Mississippi\nRiver pilot from St. Louis to New Orleans.  In eighteen months he had\npacked away in his head all those wearisome details and acquired that\nconfidence that made him one of the elect.  He knew every snag and bank\nand dead tree and depth in all those endless miles of shifting current,\nevery cut-off and crossing.  He could read the surface of the water by\nday, he could smell danger in the dark.  To the writer of these chapters,\nHorace Bixby said:",
        "“In a year and a half from the time he came to the river, Sam was not\nonly a pilot, but a good one.  Sam was a fine pilot, and in a day when\npiloting on the Mississippi required a great deal more brains and skill\nand application than it does now.  There were no signal-lights along the\nshore in those days, and no search-lights on the vessels; everything was\nblind; and on a dark, misty night, in a river full of snags and shifting\nsandbars and changing shores, a pilot’s judgment had to be founded on\nabsolute certainty.”",
        "Bixby had returned from the Missouri by the time his pupil’s license was\nissued, and promptly took him as full partner on the “Crescent City,” and\nlater on a fine new boat, the “New Falls City.”  Still later, they appear\nto have been together on a very large boat, the “City of Memphis,” and\nagain on the “Alonzo Child.”",
        "For Samuel Clemens these were happy days–the happiest, in some respects,\nhe would ever know.  He had plenty of money now.  He could help his\nmother with a liberal hand, and could put away fully a hundred dollars a\nmonth for himself.  He had few cares, and he loved the ease and romance\nand independence of his work as he would never quite love anything again.",
        "His popularity on the river was very great.  His humorous stories and\nquaint speech made a crowd collect wherever he appeared.  There were\npilot-association rooms in St. Louis and New Orleans, and his appearance\nat one of these places was a signal for the members to gather.",
        "A friend of those days writes: “He was much given to spinning yarns so\nfunny that his hearers were convulsed, and yet all the time his own face\nwas perfectly sober.  Occasionally some of his droll yarns got into the\npapers.  He may have written them himself.”",
        "Another old river-man remembers how, one day, at the association, they\nwere talking of presence of mind in an accident, when Pilot Clemens said:",
        "“Boys, I had great presence of mind once.  It was at a fire.  An old man\nleaned out of a four-story building, calling for help.  Everybody in the\ncrowd below looked up, but nobody did anything.  The ladders weren’t long\nenough.  Nobody had any presence of mind–nobody but me.  I came to the\nrescue.  I yelled for a rope.  When it came I threw the old man the end\nof it.  He caught it, and I told him to tie it around his waist.  He did\nso, and I pulled him down.”",
        "This was a story that found its way into print, probably his own\ncontribution.",
        "“Sam was always scribbling when not at the wheel,” said Bixby, “but the\nbest thing he ever did was the burlesque of old Isaiah Sellers.  He\ndidn’t write it for print, but only for his own amusement and to show to\na few of the boys.  Bart Bowen, who was with him on the “Edward J. Gay\"\nat the time, got hold of it, and gave it to one of the New Orleans\npapers.”",
        "The burlesque on Captain Sellers would be of little importance if it were\nnot for its association with the origin, or, at least, with the\noriginator, of what is probably the best known of literary names–the\nname Mark Twain.",
        "This strong, happy title–a river term indicating a depth of two fathoms\non the sounding-line–was first used by the old pilot, Isaiah Sellers,\nwho was a sort of “oldest inhabitant” of the river, with a passion for\nairing his ancient knowledge before the younger men.  Sellers used to\nsend paragraphs to the papers, quaint and rather egotistical in tone,\nusually beginning, “My opinion for the citizens of New Orleans,” etc.,\nprophesying river conditions and recalling memories as far back as 1811.\nThese he generally signed “Mark Twain.”",
        "Naturally, the younger pilots amused themselves by imitating Sellers, and\nwhen Sam Clemens wrote abroad burlesque of the old man’s contributions,\nrelating a perfectly impossible trip, supposed to have been made in 1763\nwith a Chinese captain and a Choctaw crew, it was regarded as a\nmasterpiece of wit.",
        "It appeared in the “True Delta” in May, 1859, and broke Captain Sellers’s\nliterary heart.  He never wrote another paragraph.  Clemens always\nregretted the whole matter deeply, and his own revival of the name\nafterward was a sort of tribute to the old man he had thoughtlessly and\nunintentionally wounded.",
        "Old pilots of that day remembered Samuel Clemens as a slender, fine-\nlooking man, well dressed, even dandified, generally wearing blue serge,\nwith fancy shirts, white duck trousers, and patent-leather shoes.  A\npilot could do that, for his surroundings were speckless.",
        "The pilots regarded him as a great reader–a student of history, travels,\nand the sciences.  In the association rooms they often saw him poring\nover serious books.  He began the study of French one day in New Orleans,\nwhen he had passed a school of languages where French, German, and\nItalian were taught, one in each of three rooms.  The price vas twenty-\nfive dollars for one language, or three for fifty.  The student was\nprovided with a set of conversation cards for each, and was supposed to\nwalk from one apartment to another, changing his nationality at each\nthreshold.  The young pilot, with his usual enthusiasm, invested in all\nthree languages, but after a few round trips decided that French would\ndo.  He did not return to the school, but kept the cards and added text-\nbooks.  He studied faithfully when off watch and in port, and his old\nriver note-book, still preserved, contains a number of advanced\nexercises, neatly written out.",
        "Still more interesting are the river notes themselves.  They are not the\ntimid, hesitating memoranda of the “little book” which, by Bixby’s\nadvice, he bought for his first trip.  They are quick, vigorous records\nthat show confidence and knowledge.  Under the head of “Second high-water\ntrip–Jan., 1861 ’Alonzo Child,’” the notes tell the story of a rising\nriver, with overflowing banks, blind passages, and cut-offs–a new river,\nin fact, that must be judged by a perfect knowledge of the old–guessed,\nbut guessed right.",
        "Good deal of water all over Cole’s Creek Chute, 12 or 15 ft. bank–could\nhave gone up above General Taylor’s–too much drift .  .  .  .",
        "Night–didn’t run either 77 or 76 towheads–8-ft. bank on main shore\nOzark chute.",
        "To the reader to-day it means little enough, but one may imagine,\nperhaps, a mile-wide sweep of boiling water, full of drift, shifting\ncurrents with newly forming bars, and a lone figure in the dark pilot-\nhouse, peering into the night for blind and disappearing landmarks.",
        "But such nights were not all there was of piloting.  There were glorious\nnights when the stars were blazing out, and the moon was on the water,\nand the young pilot could follow a clear channel and dream long dreams.\nHe was very serious at such times–he reviewed the world’s history he had\nread, he speculated on the future, he considered philosophies, he lost\nhimself in a study of the stars.  Mark Twain’s love of astronomy, which\nnever waned until his last day, began with those lonely river watches.\nOnce a great comet blazed in the sky, a “wonderful sheaf of light,” and\nglorified his long hours at the wheel.",
        "Samuel Clemens was now twenty-five, full of health and strong in his\ncourage.  In the old notebook there remains a well-worn clipping, the\nwords of some unknown writer, which he may have kept as a sort of creed:",
        "HOW TO TAKE LIFE.–Take it just as though it was–as it is–an earnest,\nvital, and important affair.  Take it as though you were born to the task\nof performing a merry part in it–as though the world had awaited for\nyour coming.  Take it as though it was a grand opportunity to do and\nachieve, to carry forward great and good schemes to help and cheer a\nsuffering, weary, it may be heartbroken, brother.  Now and then a man\nstands aside from the crowd, labors earnestly, steadfastly, confidently,\nand straightway becomes famous for wisdom, intellect, skill, greatness of\nsome sort.  The world wonders, admires, idolizes, and it only illustrates\nwhat others may do if they take hold of life with a purpose.  The\nmiracle, or the power that elevates the few, is to be found in their\nindustry, application, and perseverance under the promptings of a brave,\ndetermined spirit.",
        "Bixby and Clemens were together that winter on the “Child,” and were the\nclosest friends.  Once the young pilot invited his mother to make the\ntrip to New Orleans, and the river journey and a long drive about the\nbeautiful Southern city filled Jane Clemens with wonder and delight.  She\nno longer shad any doubts of Sam.  He had long since become the head of\nthe family.  She felt called upon to lecture him, now and then, but down\nin her heart she believed that he could really do no wrong.  They joked\neach other unmercifully, and her wit, never at a loss, was quite as keen\nas his.",
        "When one remembers how much Samuel Clemens loved the river, and how\nperfectly he seemed suited to the ease and romance of the pilot-life, one\nis almost tempted to regret that it should so soon have come to an end.",
        "Those trips of early ’61, which the old note-book records, were the last\nhe would ever make.  The golden days of Mississippi steam-boating were\ngrowing few.",
        "Nobody, however, seemed to suspect it.  Even a celebrated fortune-teller\nin New Orleans, whom the young pilot one day consulted as to his future,\ndid not mention the great upheaval then close at hand.  She told him\nquite remarkable things, and gave him some excellent advice, but though\nthis was February, 1861, she failed to make any mention of the Civil War!\nYet, a month later, Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated and trouble was in\nthe air.  Then in April Fort Sumter was fired upon and the war had come.",
        "It was a feverish time among the pilots.  Some were for the Union–others\nwould go with the Confederacy.  Horace Bixby stood for the North, and in\ntime was chief of the Union river-service.  A pilot named Montgomery\n(Clemens had once steered for him) went with the South and by and by\ncommanded the Confederate Mississippi fleet.  In the beginning a good\nmany were not clear as to their opinions.  Living both North and South,\nas they did, they divided their sympathies.  Samuel Clemens was\nthoughtful, and far from bloodthirsty.  A pilothouse, so fine and showy\nin times of peace, seemed a poor place to be in when fighting was going\non.  He would consider the matter.",
        "“I am not anxious to get up into a glass perch and be shot at by either\nside,” he said.  “I’ll go home and reflect.”",
        "He went up the river as a passenger on a steamer named the “Uncle Sam.\"\nZeb Leavenworth, formerly of the “John J. Roe,” was one of the pilots,\nand Clemens usually stood the watch with him.  At Memphis they barely\nescaped the blockade.  At Cairo they saw soldiers drilling–troops later\ncommanded by Grant.",
        "The “Uncle Sam” came steaming up to St. Louis, glad to have slipped\nthrough safely.  They were not quite through, however.  Abreast of\nJefferson Barracks they heard the boom of a cannon, and a great ring of\nsmoke drifted in their direction.  They did not recognize it as a\nthunderous “Halt!” and kept on.  Less than a minute later, a shell\nexploded directly in front of the pilot-house, breaking a lot of glass\nand damaging the decoration.  Zeb Leavenworth tumbled into a corner.",
        "“Gee-mighty, Sam!” he said.  “What do they mean by that?”",
        "Clemens stepped from the visitors’ bench to the wheel and brought the\nboat around.",
        "“I guess–they want us–to wait a minute–Zeb,” he said.",
        "They were examined and passed.  It was the last steamboat to make the\ntrip through from New Orleans to St. Louis.  Mark Twain’s pilot days were\nover.  He would have grieved had he known this fact.",
        "“I loved the profession far better than any I have followed since,” he\nlong afterward declared, “and I took a measureless pride in it.”",
        "At the time, like many others, he expected the war to be brief, and his\nlife to be only temporarily interrupted.  Within a year, certainly, he\nwould be back in the pilot-house.  Meantime the war must be settled; he\nwould go up to Hannibal to see about it.",
        "When he reached Hannibal, Samuel Clemens found a very mixed condition of\naffairs.  The country was in an uproar of war preparation; in a border\nState there was a confusion of sympathies, with much ignorance as to what\nit was all about.  Any number of young men were eager to enlist for a\nbrief camping-out expedition, and small private companies were formed,\ncomposed about half-and-half of Union and Confederate men, as it turned\nout later.",
        "Missouri, meantime, had allied herself with the South, and Samuel\nClemens, on his arrival in Hannibal, decided that, like Lee, he would go\nwith his State.  Old friends, who were getting up a company “to help\nGovernor `Claib’ Jackson repel the invader,” offered him a lieutenancy if\nhe would join.  It was not a big company; it had only about a dozen\nmembers, most of whom had been schoolmates, some of them fellow-pilots,\nand Sam Clemens was needed to make it complete.  It was just another Tom\nSawyer band, and they met in a secret place above Bear Creek Hill and\nplanned how they would sell their lives on the field of glory, just as\nyears before fierce raids had been arranged on peach-orchards and melon-\npatches.  Secrecy was necessary, for the Union militia had a habit of\ncoming over from Illinois and arresting suspicious armies on sight.  It\nwould humiliate the finest army in the world to spend a night or two in\nthe calaboose.",
        "So they met secretly at night, and one mysterious evening they called on\ngirls who either were their sweethearts or were pretending to be for the\noccasion, and when the time came for good-by the girls were invited to\n\"walk through the pickets” with them, though the girls didn’t notice any\npickets, because the pickets were calling on their girls, too, and were a\nlittle late getting to their posts.",
        "That night they marched, through brush and vines, because the highroad\nwas thought to be dangerous, and next morning arrived at the home of\nColonel Ralls, of Ralls County, who had the army form in dress parade and\nmade it a speech and gave it a hot breakfast in good Southern style.\nThen he sent out to Col. Bill Splawn and Farmer Nuck Matson a requisition\nfor supplies that would convert this body of infantry into cavalry–\nrough-riders of that early day.  The community did not wish to keep an\narmy on its hands, and were willing to send it along by such means as\nthey could spare handily.  When the outfitting was complete, Lieutenant\nSamuel Clemens, mounted on a small yellow mule whose tail had been\ntrimmed in the paint-brush pattern then much worn by mules, and\nsurrounded by variously attached articles–such as an extra pair of\ncowhide boots, a pair of gray blankets, a home-made quilt, a frying-pan,\na carpet-sack, a small valise, an overcoat, an old-fashioned Kentucky\nrifle, twenty yards of rope, and an umbrella–was a fair sample of the\nbrigade.",
        "An army like that, to enjoy itself, ought to go into camp; so it went\nover to Salt River, near the town of Florida, and took up headquarters in\na big log stable.  Somebody suggested that an army ought to have its hair\ncut, so that in a hand-to-hand conflict the enemy could not get hold of\nit.  There was a pair of sheep-shears in the stable, and Private Tom\nLyons acted as barber.  They were not sharp shears, and a group of little\ndarkies gathered from the farm to enjoy the torture.",
        "Regular elections were now held–all officers, down to sergeants and\norderlies, being officially chosen.  There were only three privates, and\nyou couldn’t tell them from officers.  The discipline in that army was\nvery bad.",
        "It became worse soon.  Pouring rain set in.  Salt River rose and\noverflowed the bottoms.  Men ordered on picket duty climbed up into the\nstable-loft and went to bed.  Twice, on black, drenching nights, word\ncame from the farmhouse that the enemy, commanded by a certain Col.\nUlysses Grant, was in the neighborhood, and the Hannibal division went\nhastily slopping through mud and brush in the other direction, dragging\nwearily back when the alarm was over.  Military ardor was bound to cool\nunder such treatment.  Then Lieutenant Clemens developed a very severe\nboil, and was obliged to lie most of the day on some hay in a horse-\ntrough, where he spent his time denouncing the war and the mistaken souls\nwho had invented it.  When word that “General” Tom Harris, commander of\nthe district–formerly telegraph-operator in Hannibal–was at a near-by\nfarm-house, living on the fat of the land, the army broke camp without\nfurther ceremony.  Halfway there they met General Harris, who ordered\nthem back to quarters.  They called him familiarly “Tom,” and told him\nthey were through with that camp forever.  He begged them, but it was no\nuse.  A little farther on they stopped at a farm-house for supplies.  A\ntall, bony woman came to the door.",
        "“You’re Secesh, ain’t you?”",
        "Lieutenant Clemens said: “We are, madam, defenders of the noble cause,\nand we should like to buy a few provisions.”",
        "The request seemed to inflame her.",
        "“Provisions!”  she screamed.  “Provisions for Secesh, and my husband a\ncolonel in the Union Army.  You get out of here!”",
        "She reached for a hickory hoop-pole [5] that stood by the door, and the\narmy moved on.  When they reached the home of Col. Bill Splawn it was\nnight and the family had gone to bed.  So the hungry army camped in the\nbarn-yard and crept into the hay-loft to sleep.  Presently somebody\nyelled “Fire!”  One of the boys had been smoking and had ignited the hay.",
        "Lieutenant Clemens, suddenly wakened, made a quick rotary movement away\nfrom the blaze, and rolled out of a big hay-window into the barn-yard\nbelow.  The rest of the brigade seized the burning hay and pitched it out\nof the same window.  The lieutenant had sprained his ankle when he\nstruck, and his boil was still painful, but the burning hay cured him–\nfor the moment.  He made a spring from under it; then, noticing that the\nrest of the army, now that the fire was out, seemed to think his\nperformance amusing, he rose up and expressed himself concerning the war,\nand military life, and the human race in general.  They helped him in,\nthen, for his ankle was swelling badly.",
        "In the morning, Colonel Splawn gave the army a good breakfast, and it\nmoved on.  Lieutenant Clemens, however, did not get farther than Farmer\nNuck Matson’s.  He was in a high fever by that time from his injured\nankle, and Mrs. Matson put him to bed.  So the army left him, and\npresently disbanded.  Some enlisted in the regular service, North or\nSouth, according to preference.  Properly officered and disciplined, that\n\"Tom Sawyer” band would have made as good soldiers as any.",
        "Lieutenant Clemens did not enlist again.  When he was able to walk, he\nwent to visit Orion in Keokuk.  Orion was a Union Abolitionist, but there\nwould be no unpleasantness on that account.  Samuel Clemens was beginning\nto have leanings in that direction himself.",
        "[5] In an earlier day, barrel hoops were made of small hickory trees,\nsplit and shaved.  The hoop-pole was a very familiar article of commerce,\nand of household defense.",
        "He arrived in Keokuk at what seemed a lucky moment.  Through Edward\nBates, a member of Lincoln’s Cabinet, Orion Clemens had received an\nappointment as territorial secretary of Nevada, and only needed the money\nto carry him to the seat of his office at Carson City.  Out of his\npilot’s salary his brother had saved more than enough for the journey,\nand was willing to pay both their fares and go along as private secretary\nto Orion, whose position promised something in the way of adventure and a\npossible opportunity for making a fortune.",
        "The brothers went at once to St. Louis for final leave-taking, and there\ntook boat for “St. Jo,” Missouri, terminus of the great Overland Stage\nRoute.  They paid one hundred and fifty dollars each for their passage,\nand about the end of July, 1861, set out on that long, delightful trip,\nbehind sixteen galloping horses, never stopping except for meals or to\nchange teams, heading steadily into the sunset over the billowy plains\nand snow-clad Rockies, covering the seventeen hundred miles between St.\nJo and Carson City in nineteen glorious days.",
        "But one must read Mark Twain’s “Roughing It” for the story of that long-\nago trip–the joy and wonder of it, and the inspiration.  “Even at this\nday,” he writes, “it thrills me through and through to think of the life,\nthe gladness, and the wild sense of freedom that used to make the blood\ndance in my face on those fine overland mornings.”",
        "It was a hot dusty, August day when they arrived, dusty, unshaven, and\nweather-beaten, and Samuel Clemens’s life as a frontiersman began.\nCarson City, the capital of Nevada, was a wooden town with an assorted\npopulation of two thousand souls.  The mining excitement was at its\nheight and had brought together the drift of every race.",
        "The Clemens brothers took up lodgings with a genial Irishwoman, the Mrs.\nO’Flannigan of “Roughing It,” and Orion established himself in a modest\noffice, for there was no capitol building as yet, no government\nheadquarters.  Orion could do all the work, and Samuel Clemens, finding\nneither duties nor salary attached to his position, gave himself up to\nthe study of the life about him, and to the enjoyment of the freedom of\nthe frontier.  Presently he had a following of friends who loved his\nquaint manner of speech and his yarns.  On cool nights they would collect\nabout Orion’s office-stove, and he would tell stories in the wonderful\nway that one day would delight the world.  Within a brief time Sam\nClemens (he was always “Sam” to the pioneers) was the most notable figure\non the Carson streets.  His great, bushy head of auburn hair, has\npiercing, twinkling eyes, his loose, lounging walk, his careless disorder\nof dress invited a second look, even from strangers.  From a river dandy\nhe had become the roughest-clad of pioneers–rusty slouch hat, flannel\nshirt, coarse trousers slopping half in and half out of heavy cowhide\nboots, this was his make-up.  Energetic citizens did not prophesy success\nfor him.  Often they saw him leaning against an awning support, staring\ndrowsily at the motley human procession, for as much as an hour at a\ntime.  Certainly that could not be profitable.",
        "But they did like to hear him talk.",
        "He did not catch the mining fever at once.  He was interested first in\nthe riches that he could see.  Among these was the timber-land around\nLake Bigler (now Tahoe)–splendid acres, to be had for the asking.  The\nlake itself was beautifully situated.",
        "With an Ohio boy, John Kinney, he made an excursion afoot to Tahoe, a\ntrip described in one of the best chapters of “Roughing It.”  They staked\nout a timber claim and pretended to fence it and to build a house, but\ntheir chief employment was loafing in the quiet luxury of the great woods\nor drifting in a boat on the transparent water.  They did not sleep in\nthe house.  In “Roughing It” he says:",
        "“It never occurred to us, for one thing; and, besides, it was built\n     to hold the ground, and that was enough.  We did not wish to strain\n     it.”",
        "They made their camp-fires on the borders of the lake, and one evening it\ngot away from them, fired the forest, and destroyed their fences and\nhabitation.  In a letter home he describes this fire in a fine, vivid\nway.  At one place he says:",
        "“The level ranks of flame were relieved at intervals by the standard-\n     bearers, as we called the tall dead trees, wrapped in fire, and\n     waving their blazing banners a hundred feet in the air.  Then we\n     could turn from the scene to the lake, and see every branch and leaf\n     and cataract of flame upon its banks perfectly reflected, as in a\n     gleaming, fiery mirror.”",
        "He was acquiring the literary vision and touch.  The description of this\nsame fire in “Roughing It,” written ten years later, is scarcely more\nvivid.",
        "Most of his letters home at this time tell of glowing prospects–the\ncertainty of fortune ahead.  The fever of the frontier is in them.  Once,\nto Pamela Moffett, he wrote:",
        "“Orion and I have enough confidence in this country to think that, if\n     the war lets us alone, we can make Mr. Moffett rich without its ever\n     costing him a cent or a particle of trouble.”",
        "From the same letter we gather that the brothers are now somewhat\ninterested in mining claims:",
        "“We have about 1,650 feet of mining-ground, and, if it proves good,\n     Mr. Moffett’s name will go in; and if not, I can get ’feet’ for him\n     in the spring.”",
        "This was written about the end of October.  Two months later, in\nmidwinter, the mining fever came upon him with full force.",
        "The wonder is that Samuel Clemens, always speculative and visionary, had\nnot fallen an earlier victim.  Everywhere one heard stories of sudden\nfortune–of men who had gone to bed paupers and awakened millionaires.\nNew and fabulous finds were reported daily.  Cart-loads of bricks–silver\nand gold bricks–drove through the Carson streets.",
        "Then suddenly from the newly opened Humboldt region came the wildest\nreports.  The mountains there were said to be stuffed with gold.  A\ncorrespondent of the “Territorial Enterprise” was unable to find words to\npicture the riches of the Humboldt mines.",
        "The air for Samuel Clemens began to shimmer.  Fortune was waiting to be\ngathered in a basket.  He joined the first expedition for Humboldt–in\nfact, helped to organize it.  In “Roughing It” he says:",
        "“Hurry was the word!  We wasted no time.  Our party consisted of four\n     persons–a blacksmith sixty years of age, two young lawyers, and\n     myself.  We bought a wagon and two miserable old horses.  We put\n     eighteen hundred pounds of provisions and mining-tools in the wagon\n     and drove out of Carson on a chilly December afternoon..”",
        "The two young lawyers were W. H. Clagget, whom Clemens had known in\nKeokuk, and A. W. Oliver, called Oliphant in “Roughing It.”   The\nblacksmith was named Tillou (Ballou in “Roughing It”), a sturdy, honest\nman with a knowledge of mining and the repair of tools.  There were also\ntwo dogs in the party–a curly-tailed mongrel and a young hound.",
        "The horses were the weak feature of the expedition.  It was two hundred\nmiles to Humboldt, mostly across sand.  The miners rode only a little\nway, then got out to lighten the load.  Later they pushed.  Then it began\nto snow, also to blow, and the air became filled with whirling clouds of\nsnow and sand.  On and on they pushed and groaned, sustained by the\nknowledge that they must arrive some time, when right away they would be\nmillionaires and all their troubles would be over.",
        "The nights were better.  The wind went down and they made a camp-fire in\nthe shelter of the wagon, cooked their bacon, crept under blankets with\nthe dogs to warm them, and Sam Clemens spun yarns till they fell asleep.",
        "There had been an Indian war, and occasionally they passed the charred\nruin of a cabin and new graves.  By and by they came to that deadly waste\nknown as the Alkali Desert, strewn with the carcasses of dead beasts and\nwith the heavy articles discarded by emigrants in their eagerness to\nreach water.  All day and night they pushed through that choking,\nwaterless plain to reach camp on the other side.  When they arrived at\nthree in the morning, they dropped down exhausted.  Judge Oliver, the\nlast survivor of the party, in a letter to the writer of these chapters,\nsaid:",
        "“The sun was high in the heavens when we were aroused from our sleep\n     by a yelling band of Piute warriors.  We were upon our feet in an\n     instant.  The picture of burning cabins and the lonely graves we had\n     passed was in our minds.  Our scalps were still our own, and not\n     dangling from the belts of our visitors.  Sam pulled himself\n     together, put his hand on his head, as if to make sure he had not\n     been scalped, and, with his inimitable drawl, said ’Boys, they have\n     left us our scalps.  Let us give them all the flour and sugar they\n     ask for.’  And we did give them a good supply, for we were grateful.”",
        "The Indians left them unharmed, and the prospective millionaires moved\non.  Across that two hundred miles to the Humboldt country they pushed,\narriving at the little camp of Unionville at the end of eleven weary\ndays.",
        "In “Roughing It” Mark Twain has told us of Unionville and the mining\nexperience there.  Their cabin was a three-sided affair with a cotton\nroof.  Stones rolled down the mountainside on them; also, the author\nsays, a mule and a cow.",
        "The author could not gather fortune in a basket, as he had dreamed.\nMasses of gold and silver were not lying about.  He gathered a back-load\nof yellow, glittering specimens, but they proved worthless.  Gold in the\nrough did not glitter, and was not yellow.  Tillou instructed the others\nin prospecting, and they went to work with pick and shovel–then with\ndrill and blasting-powder.  The prospect of immediately becoming\nmillionaires vanished.",
        "“One week of this satisfied me.  I resigned,” is Mark Twain’s brief\ncomment.",
        "The Humboldt reports had been exaggerated.  The Clemens-Clagget-Oliver-\nTillou millionaire combination soon surrendered its claims.  Clemens and\nTillou set out for Carson City with a Prussian named Pfersdorff, who\nnearly got them drowned and got them completely lost in the snow before\nthey arrived there.  Oliver and Clagget remained in Unionville, began law\npractice, and were elected to office.  It is not known what became of the\nwagon and horses and the two dogs.",
        "It was the end of January when our miner returned to Carson.  He was not\ndiscouraged–far from it.  He believed he had learned something that\nwould be useful to him in a camp where mines were a reality.  Within a\nfew weeks from his return we find him at Aurora, in the Esmeralda region,\non the edge of California.  It was here that the Clemens brothers owned\nthe 1,650 feet formerly mentioned.  He had came down to work it.",
        "It was the dead of winter, but he was full of enthusiasm, confident of a\nfortune by early summer.  To Pamela he wrote:",
        "“I expect to return to St. Louis in July–per steamer.  I don’t say\n     that I will return then, or that I shall be able to do it–but I\n     expect to–you bet .  .  .  . If nothing goes wrong, we’ll strike\n     the ledge in June.”",
        "He was trying to be conservative, and further along he cautions his\nsister not to get excited.",
        "“Don’t you know I have only talked as yet, but proved nothing?  Don’t\n     you know I have never held in my hands a gold or silver bar that\n     belonged to me?  Don’t you know that people who always feel jolly,\n     no matter where they are or what happens to them–who have the organ\n     of hope preposterously developed–who are endowed with an\n     uncongealable, sanguine temperament–who never feel concerned about\n     the price of corn–and who cannot, by any possibility, discover any\n     but the bright side of a picture–are very apt to go to extremes and\n     exaggerate with a 40-horse microscopic power?",
        "“But-but–\n     In the bright lexicon of youth,\n     There is no such word as fail,\n     and I’ll prove it.”",
        "Whereupon he soars again, adding page after page full of glowing\nexpectations and plans such as belong only with speculation in treasures\nburied in the ground–a very difficult place, indeed, to find them.",
        "His money was about exhausted by this time, and funds to work the mining\nclaims must come out of Orion’s rather modest salary.  The brothers owned\nall claims in partnership, and it was now the part of “Brother Sam” to do\nthe active work.  He hated the hard picking and prying and blasting into\nthe flinty ledges, but the fever drove him on.  He camped with a young\nman named Phillips at first, and, later on, with an experienced miner,\nCalvin H. Higbie, to whom “Roughing It” would one day be dedicated.  They\nlived in a tiny cabin with a cotton roof, and around their rusty stove\nthey would paw over their specimens and figure the fortune that their\nmines would be worth in the spring.",
        "Food ran low, money gave out almost entirely, but they did not give up.\nWhen it was stormy and they could not dig, and the ex-pilot was in a\ntalkative vein, he would sit astride the bunk and distribute to his\nhearers riches more valuable than any they would dig from the Esmeralda\nhills.  At other times he did not talk at all, but sat in a corner and\nwrote.  They thought he was writing home; they did not know that he was\n\"literary.”  Some of his home letters had found their way into a Keokuk\npaper and had come back to Orion, who had shown them to an assistant on\nthe “Territorial Enterprise,” of Virginia City.  The “Enterprise” man had\ncaused one of them to be reprinted, and this had encouraged its author to\nsend something to the paper direct.  He signed these contributions\n\"Josh,” and one told of:",
        "“An old, old horse whose name was Methusalem,\n          Took him down and sold him in Jerusalem,\n          A long time ago.”",
        "He received no pay for these offerings and expected none.  He considered\nthem of no value.  If any one had told him that he was knocking at the\ndoor of the house of fame, however feebly, he would have doubted that\nperson’s judgment or sincerity.",
        "His letters to Orion, in Carson City, were hasty compositions, reporting\nprogress and progress, or calling for remittances to keep the work going.\nOn April 13, he wrote:",
        "“Work not begun on the Horatio and Derby–haven’t seen it yet.  It is\n     still in the snow.  Shall begin on it within three or four weeks–\n     strike the ledge in July.”",
        "Again, later in the month:",
        "“I have been at work all day, blasting and digging in one of our new\n     claims, ’Dashaway,’ which I don’t think a great deal of, but which I\n     am willing to try.  We are down now ten or twelve feet.”",
        "It must have been disheartening work, picking away at the flinty ledges.\nThere is no further mention of the “Dashaway,” but we hear of the\n\"Flyaway,” the “Annipolitan,” the “Live Yankee,” and of many another,\neach of which holds out a beacon of hope for a brief moment, then passes\nfrom notice forever.  Still, he was not discouraged.  Once he wrote:",
        "“I am a citizen here and I am satisfied, though ’Ratio and I are\n     ’strapped’ and we haven’t three days’ rations in the house.  I shall\n     work the “Monitor” and the other claims with my own hands.",
        "“The pick and shovel are the only claims I have confidence in now,\"\n     he wrote, later; “my back is sore and my hands are blistered with\n     handling them to-day.”",
        "His letters began to take on a weary tone.  Once in midsummer he wrote\nthat it was still snowing up there in the hills, and added, “It always\nsnows here I expect.  If we strike it rich, I’ve lost my guess, that’s\nall.”  And the final heartsick line, “Don’t you suppose they have pretty\nmuch quit writing at home?”",
        "In time he went to work in a quartz-mill at ten dollars a week, though it\nwas not entirely for the money, as in “Roughing It” he would have us\nbelieve.  Samuel Clemens learned thoroughly what he undertook, and he\nproposed to master the science of mining.  From Phillips and Higbie he\nhad learned what there was to know about prospecting.  He went to the\nmill to learn refining, so that, when his claims developed, he could\nestablish a mill and personally superintend the work.  His stay was\nbrief.  He contracted a severe cold and came near getting poisoned by the\nchemicals.  Recovering, he went with Higbie for an outing to Mono Lake, a\nghastly, lifeless alkali sea among the hills, vividly described in\n\"Roughing It.”",
        "At another time he went with Higbie on a walking trip to the Yosemite,\nwhere they camped and fished undisturbed, for in those days few human\nbeings came to that far isolation.  Discouragement did not reach them\nthere–amid that vast grandeur and quiet the quest for gold hardly seemed\nworth while.  Now and again that summer he went alone into the wilderness\nto find his balance and to get entirely away from humankind.",
        "In “Roughing It” Mark Twain tells the story of how he and Higbie finally\nlocated a “blind lead,” which made them really millionaires, until they\nforfeited their claim through the sharp practice of some rival miners and\ntheir own neglect.  It is true that the “Wide West” claim was forfeited\nin some such manner, but the size of the loss was magnified in “Roughing\nIt,” to make a good story.  There was never a fortune in “Wide West,\"\nexcept the one sunk in it by its final owners.  The story as told in\n\"Roughing It” is a tale of what might have happened, and ends the\nauthor’s days in the mines with a good story-book touch.",
        "The mining career of Samuel Clemens really came to a close gradually, and\nwith no showy climax.  He fought hard and surrendered little by little,\nwithout owning, even to the end, that he was surrendering at all.  It was\nthe gift of resolution that all his life would make his defeats long and\ncostly–his victories supreme.",
        "By the end of July the money situation in the Aurora camp was getting\ndesperate.  Orion’s depleted salary would no longer pay for food, tools,\nand blasting-powder, and the miner began to cast about far means to earn\nan additional sum, however small.  The “Josh” letters to the “Enterprise\"\nhad awakened interest as to their author, and Orion had not failed to let\n\"Josh’s\" identity be known.  The result had been that here and there a\ncoast paper had invited contributions and even suggested payment.  A\nletter written by the Aurora miner at the end of July tells this part of\nthe story:",
        "“My debts are greater than I thought for .  .  .  . The fact is, I\n     must have something to do, and that shortly, too .  .  .  .  Now\n     write to the “Sacramento Union” folks, or to Marsh, and tell them\n     that I will write as many letters a week as they want, for $10 a\n     week.  My board must be paid.",
        "“Tell them I have corresponded with the “New Orleans Crescent” and\n     other papers–and the “Enterprise.”",
        "“If they want letters from here–who’ll run from morning till night\n     collecting material cheaper?  I’ll write a short letter twice a week,\n     for the present, for the “Age,” for $5 per week.  Now it has been a\n     long time since I couldn’t make my own living, and it shall be a long\n     time before I loaf another year.”",
        "This all led to nothing, but about the same time the “Enterprise\"\nassistant already mentioned spoke to Joseph T. Goodman, owner and editor\nof the paper, about adding “Josh” to their regular staff.  “Joe” Goodman,\na man of keen humor and literary perception, agreed that the author of\nthe “Josh” letters might be useful to them.  One of the sketches\nparticularly appealed to him–a burlesque report of a Fourth of July\noration.",
        "“That is the kind of thing we want,” he said.  “Write to him, Barstow,\nand ask him if he wants to come up here.”",
        "Barstow wrote, offering twenty-five dollars a week–a tempting sum.  This\nwas at the end of July, 1862.",
        "Yet the hard-pressed miner made no haste to accept the offer.  To leave\nAurora meant the surrender of all hope in the mines, the confession of\nanother failure.  He wrote Barstow, asking when he thought he might be\nneeded.  And at the same time, in a letter to Orion, he said:",
        "“I shall leave at midnight to-night, alone and on foot, for a walk of\n     sixty or seventy miles through a totally uninhabited country.  But\n     do you write Barstow that I have left here for a week or so, and, in\n     case he should want me, he must write me here, or let me know\n     through you.”",
        "He had gone into the wilderness to fight out his battle alone, postponing\nthe final moment of surrender–surrender that, had he known, only meant\nthe beginning of victory.  He was still undecided when he returned eight\ndays later and wrote to his sister Pamela a letter in which there is no-\nmention of newspaper prospects.",
        "Just how and when the end came at last cannot be known; but one hot,\ndusty August afternoon, in Virginia City, a worn, travel-stained pilgrim\ndragged himself into the office of the “Territorial Enterprise,” then in\nits new building on C Street, and, loosening a heavy roll of blankets\nfrom his shoulder, dropped wearily into a chair.  He wore a rusty slouch\nhat, no coat, a faded blue-flannel shirt, a navy revolver; his trousers\nwere tucked into his boot-tops; a tangle of reddish-brown hair fell on\nhis shoulders; a mass of tawny beard, dingy with alkali dust, dropped\nhalf-way to his waist.",
        "Aurora lay one hundred and thirty miles from Virginia City.  He had\nwalked that distance, carrying his heavy load.  Editor Goodman was absent\nat the moment, but the other proprietor, Dennis E. McCarthy, asked the\ncaller to state his errand.  The wanderer regarded him with a far-away\nlook and said, absently, and with deliberation:",
        "“My starboard leg seems to be unshipped.  I’d like about one hundred\n     yards of line; I think I’m falling to pieces.”  Then he added: “I\n     want to see Mr. Barstow or Mr. Goodman.  My name is Clemens, and\n     I’ve come to write for the paper.”",
        "It was the master of the world’s widest estate come to claim his kingdom!",
        "In 1852 Virginia City, Nevada, was the most flourishing of mining towns.\nA half-crazy miner, named Comstock, had discovered there a vein of such\nrichness that the “Comstock Lode” was presently glutting the mineral\nmarkets of the world.  Comstock himself got very little out of it, but\nthose who followed him made millions.  Miners, speculators, adventurers\nswarmed in.  Every one seemed to have money.  The streets seethed with an\neager, affluent, boisterous throng whose chief business seemed to be to\nspend the wealth that the earth was yielding in such a mighty stream.",
        "Business of every kind boomed.  Less than two years earlier, J. T.\nGoodman, a miner who was also a printer and a man of literary taste, had\njoined with another printer, Dennis McCarthy, and the two had managed to\nbuy a struggling Virginia City paper, the “Territorial Enterprise.”   But\nthen came the hightide of fortune.  A year later the “Enterprise,” from a\nstarving sheet in a leaky shanty, had become a large, handsome paper in a\nnew building, and of such brilliant editorial management that it was the\nmost widely considered journal on the Pacific coast.",
        "Goodman was a fine, forceful writer, and he surrounded himself with able\nmen.  He was a young man, full of health and vigor, overflowing with the\nfresh spirit and humor of the West.  Comstockers would always laugh at a\njoke, and Goodman was always willing to give it to them.  The\n\"Enterprise” was a newspaper, but it was willing to furnish entertainment\neven at the cost of news.  William Wright, editorially next to Goodman,\nwas a humorist of ability.  His articles, signed Dan de Quille, were\nwidely copied.  R. M. Daggett (afterward United States Minister to\nHawaii) was also an “Enterprise” man, and there were others of their\nsort.",
        "Samuel Clemens fitted precisely into this group.  He brought with him a\nnew turn of thought and expression; he saw things with open eyes, and\nwrote of them in a fresh, wild way that Comstockers loved.  He was\nallowed full freedom.  Goodman suppressed nothing; his men could write as\nthey chose.  They were all young together–if they pleased themselves,\nthey were pretty sure to please their readers.  Often they wrote of one\nanother–squibs and burlesques, which gratified the Comstock far more\nthan mere news.  It was just the school to produce Mark Twain.",
        "The new arrival found acquaintance easy.  The whole “Enterprise” force\nwas like one family; proprietors, editor, and printers were social\nequals.  Samuel Clemens immediately became “Sam” to his associates, just\nas De Quille was “Dan,” and Goodman “Joe.”  Clemens was supposed to\nreport city items, and did, in fact, do such work, which he found easy,\nfor his pilot-memory made notes unnecessary.",
        "He could gather items all day, and at night put down the day’s budget\nwell enough, at least, to delight his readers.  When he was tired of\nfacts, he would write amusing paragraphs, as often as not something about\nDan, or a reporter on a rival paper.  Dan and the others would reply, and\nthe Comstock would laugh.  Those were good old days.",
        "Sometimes he wrote hoaxes.  Once he told with great circumstance and\ndetail of a petrified prehistoric man that had been found embedded in a\nrock in the desert, and how the coroner from Humboldt had traveled more\nthan a hundred miles to hold an inquest over a man dead for centuries,\nand had refused to allow miners to blast the discovery from its position.",
        "The sketch was really intended as a joke on the Humboldt coroner, but it\nwas so convincingly written that most of the Coast papers took it\nseriously and reprinted it as the story of a genuine discovery.  In time\nthey awoke, and began to inquire as to who was the smart writer on the\n\"Enterprise.”",
        "Mark Twain did a number of such things, some of which are famous on the\nCoast to this day.",
        "Clemens himself did not escape.  Lamps were used in the “Enterprise\"\noffice, but he hated the care of a lamp, and worked evenings by the light\nof a candle.  It was considered a great joke in the office to “hide Sam’s\ncandle” and hear him fume and rage, walking in a circle meantime–a habit\nacquired in the pilothouse–and scathingly denouncing the culprits.\nEventually the office-boy, supposedly innocent, would bring another\ncandle, and quiet would follow.  Once the office force, including De\nQuille, McCarthy, and a printer named Stephen Gillis, of whom Clemens was\nvery fond, bought a large imitation meerschaum pipe, had a German-silver\nplate set on it, properly engraved, and presented it to Samuel Clemens as\ngenuine, in testimony of their great esteem.  His reply to the\npresentation speech was so fine and full of feeling that the jokers felt\nashamed of their trick.  A few days later, when he discovered the\ndeception, he was ready to destroy the lot of them.  Then, in atonement,\nthey gave him a real meerschaum.  Such things kept the Comstock\nentertained.",
        "There was a side to Samuel Clemens that, in those days, few of his\nassociates saw.  This was the poetic, the reflective side.  Joseph\nGoodman, like Macfarlane in Cincinnati several years earlier, recognized\nthis phase of his character and developed it.  Often these two, dining or\nwalking together, discussed the books and history they had read, quoted\nfrom poems that gave them pleasure.  Clemens sometimes recited with great\npower the “Burial of Moses,” whose noble phrasing and majestic imagery\nseemed to move him deeply.  With eyes half closed and chin lifted, a\nlighted cigar between his fingers, he would lose himself in the music of\nthe stately lines:",
        "               By Nebo’s lonely mountain,\n                 On this side Jordan’s wave,\n               In a vale in the land of Moab\n                 There lies a lonely grave.\n               And no man knows that sepulcher,\n                 And no man saw it e’er,\n               For the angels of God upturned the sod,\n                 And laid the dead man there.",
        "That his own writing would be influenced by the simple grandeur of this\npoem we can hardly doubt.  Indeed, it may have been to him a sort of\nliterary touchstone, that in time would lead him to produce, as has been\nsaid, some of the purest English written by any modern author.",
        "It was once when Goodman and Clemens were dining together that the latter\nasked to be allowed to report the proceedings of the coming legislature\nat Carson City.  He knew nothing of such work, and Goodman hesitated.\nThen, remembering that Clemens would, at least, make his reports\nreadable, whether they were parliamentary or not, he consented.",
        "So, at the beginning of the year (1863), Samuel Clemens undertook a new\nand interesting course in the study of human nature–the political human\nnature of the frontier.  There could have been no better school for him.\nHis wit, his satire, his phrasing had full swing–his letters, almost\nfrom the beginning, were copied as choice reading up and down the Coast.\nHe made curious blunders, at first, as to the proceedings, but his open\nconfession of ignorance in the early letters made these blunders their\nchief charm.  A young man named Gillespie, clerk of the House, coached\nhim, and in return was christened “Young Jefferson’s Manual,” a title\nwhich he bore for many years.",
        "A reporter named Rice, on a rival Virginia City paper, the “Union,” also\nearned for himself a title through those early letters.",
        "Rice concluded to poke fun at the “Enterprise” reports, pointing out\ntheir mistakes.  But this was not wise.  Clemens, in his next\ncontribution, admitted that Rice’s reports might be parliamentary enough,\nbut declared his glittering technicalities were only to cover\nmisstatements of fact.  He vowed they were wholly untrustworthy, dubbed\nthe author of them “The Unreliable,” and never thereafter referred to him\nby any other term.  Carson and the Comstock papers delighted in this\nfoolery, and Rice became “The Unreliable” for life.  There was no real\nfeeling between Rice and Clemens.  They were always the best of friends.",
        "But now we arrive at the story of still another name, one of vastly\ngreater importance than either of those mentioned, for it is the name\nchosen by Samuel Clemens for himself.  In those days it was the fashion\nfor a writer to have a pen-name, especially for his journalistic and\nhumorous work.  Clemens felt that his “Enterprise” letters, copied up and\ndown the Coast, needed a mark of identity.",
        "He gave the matter a good deal of thought.  He wanted something brief and\nstrong–something that would stick in the mind.  It was just at this time\nthat news came of the death of Capt. Isaiah Sellers, the old pilot who\nhad signed himself “Mark Twain.”   Mark Twain!  That was the name he\nwanted.  It was not trivial.  It had all the desired qualities.  Captain\nSellers would never need it again.  It would do no harm to keep it alive-\n-to give it a new meaning in a new land.  Clemens took a trip from Carson\nup to Virginia City.",
        "“Joe,” he said to Goodman, “I want to sign my articles.  I want to be\nidentified to a wider audience.”",
        "“All right, Sam.  What name do you want to use Josh?”",
        "“No, I want to sign them Mark Twain.  It is an old river term, a\nleadsman’s call, signifying two fathoms–twelve feet.  It has a richness\nabout it; it was always a pleasant sound for a pilot to hear on a dark\nnight; it meant safe waters.”",
        "He did not mention that Captain Sellers had used and dropped the name.\nHe was not proud of his part in that episode, and it was too recent for\nconfession.",
        "Goodman considered a moment.  “Very well, Sam,” he said, “that sounds\nlike a good name.”",
        "A good name, indeed!  Probably, if he had considered every combination of\nwords in the language, he could not have found a better one.  To-day we\nrecognize it as the greatest nom de plume ever chosen, and, somehow, we\ncannot believe that the writer of “Tom Sawyer” and “Huck Finn” and\n\"Roughing It” could have selected any other had he tried.",
        "The name Mark Twain was first signed to a Carson letter, February 2,\n1863, and after that to all of Samuel Clemens’s work.  The letters that\nhad amused so many readers had taken on a new interest–the interest that\ngoes with a name.  It became immediately more than a pen-name.  Clemens\nfound he had attached a name to himself as well as to his letters.\nEverybody began to address him as Mark.  Within a few weeks he was no\nlonger “Sam” or “Clemens,” but Mark–Mark Twain.  The Coast papers liked\nthe sound of it.  It began to mean something to their readers.  By the\nend of that legislative session Samuel Clemens, as Mark Twain, had\nacquired out there on that breezy Western slope something resembling\nfame.",
        "Curiously, he fails to mention any of this success in his letters home of\nthat period.  Indeed, he seldom refers to his work, but more often speaks\nof mining shares which he has accumulated, and their possible values.\nHis letters are airy, full of the joy of life and of the wild doings of\nthe frontier.  Closing one of them, he says: “I have just heard five\npistolshots down the street.  As such things are in my line, I will go\nand see about it.”",
        "And in a postscript, later, he adds:",
        "“5 A.M.–The pistol-shots did their work well.  One man, a Jackson\n     County Missourian, shot two of my friends (police officers) through\n     the heart–both died within three minutes.  The murderer’s name is\n     John Campbell.”",
        "The Comstock was a great school for Mark Twain, and in “Roughing It” he\nhas left us a faithful picture of its long-vanished glory.",
        "More than one national character came out of the Comstock school.\nSenator James G. Fair was one of them, and John Mackay, both miners with\npick and shovel at first, though Mackay presently became a\nsuperintendent.  Mark Twain one day laughingly offered to trade jobs with\nMackay.",
        "“No,” Mackay said, “I can’t trade.  My business is not worth as much as\nyours.  I have never swindled anybody, and I don’t intend to begin now.”",
        "For both these men the future held splendid gifts: for Mackay vast\nwealth, for Mark Twain the world’s applause, and neither would have long\nto wait.",
        "It was about the end of 1863 that a new literary impulse came into Mark\nTwain’s life.  The gentle and lovable humorist Artemus Ward (Charles F.\nBrowne) was that year lecturing in the West, and came to Virginia City.\nWard had intended to stay only a few days, but the whirl of the Comstock\nfascinated him.  He made the “Enterprise” office his headquarters and\nremained three weeks.  He and Mark Twain became boon companions.  Their\nhumor was not unlike; they were kindred spirits, together almost\nconstantly.  Ward was then at the summit of his fame, and gave the\nyounger man the highest encouragement, prophesying great things for ha\nwork.  Clemens, on his side, was stirred, perhaps for the first time,\nwith a real literary ambition, and the thought that he, too, might win a\nplace of honor.  He promised Ward that he would send work to the Eastern\npapers.",
        "On Christmas Eve, Ward gave a dinner to the “Enterprise” staff, at\nChaumond’s, a fine French restaurant of that day.  When refreshments\ncame, Artemus lifted his glass, and said:",
        "“I give you Upper Canada.”",
        "The company rose and drank the toast in serious silence.  Then Mr.\nGoodman said:",
        "“Of course, Artemus, it’s all right, but why did you give us Upper\nCanada?”",
        "“Because I don’t want it myself,” said Ward, gravely.",
        "What would one not give to have listened to the talk of that evening!\nMark Twain’s power had awakened; Artemus Ward was in his prime.  They\nwere giants of a race that became extinct when Mark Twain died.",
        "Goodman remained rather quiet during the evening.  Ward had appointed him\nto order the dinner, and he had attended to this duty without mingling\nmuch in the conversation.  When Ward asked him why he did not join the\nbanter, he said:",
        "“I am preparing a joke, Artemus, but I am keeping it for the present.”",
        "At a late hour Ward finally called for the bill.  It was two hundred and\nthirty-seven dollars.",
        "“What!” exclaimed Artemus.",
        "“That’s my joke,” said Goodman.",
        "“But I was only exclaiming because it was not twice as much,” laughed\nWard, laying the money on the table.",
        "Ward remained through the holidays, and later wrote back an affectionate\nletter to Mark Twain.",
        "“I shall always remember Virginia as a bright spot in my existence,” he\nsaid, “as all others must, or rather, cannot be, as it were.”",
        "With Artemus Ward’s encouragement, Mark Twain now began sending work\neastward.  The “New York Sunday Mercury” published one, possibly more, of\nhis sketches, but they were not in his best vein, and made little\nimpression.  He may have been too busy for outside work, for the\nlegislative session of 1864 was just beginning.  Furthermore, he had been\nchosen governor of the “Third House,” a mock legislature, organized for\none session, to be held as a church benefit.  The “governor” was to\ndeliver a message, which meant that he was to burlesque from the platform\nall public officials and personages, from the real governor down.",
        "With the exception of a short talk he had once given at a printer’s\ndinner in Keokuk, it was Mark Twain’s first appearance as a speaker, and\nthe beginning of a lifelong series of triumphs on the platform.  The\nbuilding was packed–the aisles full.  The audience was ready for fun,\nand he gave it to them.  Nobody escaped ridicule; from beginning to end\nthe house was a storm of laughter and applause.",
        "Not a word of this first address of Mark Twain’s has been preserved, but\nthose who heard it always spoke of it as the greatest effort of his life,\nas to them it seemed, no doubt.",
        "For his Third House address, Clemens was presented with a gold watch,\ninscribed “To Governor Mark Twain.”  Everywhere, now, he was pointed out\nas a distinguished figure, and his quaint remarks were quoted.  Few of\nthese sayings are remembered to-day, though occasionally one is still\nunforgotten.  At a party one night, being urged to make a conundrum, he\nsaid:",
        "“Well, why am I like the Pacific Ocean?”",
        "Several guesses were made, but he shook his head.  Some one said:",
        "“We give it up.  Tell us, Mark, why are you like the Pacific Ocean?”",
        "“I–don’t–know,” he drawled.  “I was just–asking for information.”",
        "The governor of Nevada was generally absent, and Orion Clemens was\nexecutive head of the territory.  His wife, who had joined him in Carson\nCity, was social head of the little capital, and Brother Sam, with his\nnew distinction and now once more something of a dandy in dress, was\nsociety’s chief ornament–a great change, certainly, from the early\nmonths of his arrival less than three years before.",
        "It was near the end of May, 1864, when Mark Twain left Nevada for San\nFrancisco.  The immediate cause of his going was a duel–a duel\nelaborately arranged between Mark Twain and the editor of a rival paper,\nbut never fought.  In fact, it was mainly a burlesque affair throughout,\nchiefly concocted by that inveterate joker, Steve Gillis, already\nmentioned in connection with the pipe incident.  The new dueling law,\nhowever, did not distinguish between real and mock affrays, and the\nprospect of being served with a summons made a good excuse for Clemens\nand Gillis to go to San Francisco, which had long attracted them.  They\nwere great friends, these two, and presently were living together and\nworking on the same paper, the “Morning Call,” Clemens as a reporter and\nGillis as a compositor.",
        "Gillis, with his tendency to mischief, was a constant exasperation to his\nroom-mate, who, goaded by some new torture, would sometimes denounce him\nin feverish terms.  Yet they were never anything but the closest friends.",
        "Mark Twain did not find happiness in his new position on the “Call.\"\nThere was less freedom and more drudgery than he had known on the\n\"Enterprise.”  His day was spent around the police court, attending\nfires, weddings, and funerals, with brief glimpses of the theaters at\nnight.",
        "Once he wrote: “It was fearful drudgery–soulless drudgery–and almost\ndestitute of interest.  It was an awful slavery for a lazy man.”",
        "It must have been so.  There was little chance for original work.  He had\nbecome just a part of a news machine.  He saw many public abuses that he\nwished to expose, but the policy of the paper opposed him.  Once,\nhowever, he found a policeman asleep on his beat.  Going to a near-by\nvegetable stall, he borrowed a large cabbage-leaf, came back, and stood\nover the sleeper, gently fanning him.  He knew the paper would not\npublish the policeman’s negligence, but he could advertise it in his own\nway.  A large crowd soon collected, much amused.  When he thought the\naudience large enough, he went away.  Next day the joke was all over the\ncity.",
        "He grew indifferent to the “Call” work, and, when an assistant was\nallowed him to do part of the running for items, it was clear to\neverybody that presently the assistant would be able to do it all.",
        "But there was a pleasant and profitable side to the San Francisco life.\nThere were real literary people there–among them a young man, with rooms\nupstairs in the “Call” office, Francis Bret Harte, editor of the\n\"Californian,” a new literary weekly which Charles Henry Webb had\nrecently founded.  Bret Harte was not yet famous, but his gifts were\nrecognized on the Pacific slope, especially by the “Era” group of\nwriters, the “Golden Era” being a literary monthly of considerable\ndistinction.  Joaquin Miller recalls, from his diary of that period,\nhaving seen Prentice Mulford, Bret Harte, Charles Warren Stoddard, Mark\nTwain, Artemus Ward, and others, all assembled there at one time–a\nremarkable group, certainly, to be dropped down behind the Sierras so\nlong ago.  They were a hopeful, happy lot, and sometimes received five\ndollars for an article, which, of course, seemed a good deal more\nprecious than a much larger sum earned in another way.",
        "Mark Twain had contributed to the “Era” while still in Virginia City, and\nnow, with Bret Harte, was ranked as a leader of the group.  The two were\nmuch together, and when Harte became editor of the “Californian” he\nengaged Clemens as a regular contributor at the very fancy rate of twelve\ndollars an article.  Some of the brief chapters included to-day in\n\"Sketches New and Old” were done at this time.  They have humor, but are\nnot equal to his later work, and beyond the Pacific slope they seem to\nhave attracted little attention.",
        "In “Roughing It” the author tells us how he finally was dismissed from\nthe “Call” for general incompetency, and presently found himself in the\ndepths of hard luck, debt, and poverty.  But this is only his old habit\nof making a story on himself sound as uncomplimentary as possible.  The\ntrue version is that the “Call” publisher and Mark Twain had a friendly\ntalk and decided that it was better for both to break off the connection.\nAlmost immediately he arranged to write a daily San Francisco letter for\nthe “Enterprise,” for which he received thirty dollars a week.  This,\nwith his earnings from the “Californian,” made his total return larger\nthan before.  Very likely he was hard up from time to time–literary men\nare often that–but that he was ever in abject poverty, as he would have\nus believe, is just a good story and not history.",
        "Mark Twain’s daily letters to the “Enterprise” stirred up trouble for him\nin San Francisco.  He was free, now, to write what he chose, and he\nattacked the corrupt police management with such fierceness that, when\ncopies of the “Enterprise” got back to San Francisco, they started a\ncommotion at the city hall.  Then Mark Twain let himself go more\nvigorously than ever.  He sent letters to the “Enterprise” that made even\nthe printers afraid.  Goodman, however, was fearless, and let them go in,\nword for word.  The libel suit which the San Francisco chief of police\nbrought against the Enterprise advertised the paper amazingly.",
        "But now came what at the time seemed an unfortunate circumstance.  Steve\nGillis, always a fearless defender of the weak, one night rushed to the\nassistance of two young fellows who had been set upon by three roughs.\nGillis, though small of stature, was a terrific combatant, and he\npresently put two of the assailants to flight and had the other ready for\nthe hospital.  Next day it turned out that the roughs were henchmen of\nthe police, and Gillis was arrested.",
        "Clemens went his bail, and advised Steve to go down to Virginia City\nuntil the storm blew over.",
        "But it did not blow over for Mark Twain.  The police department was only\ntoo glad to have a chance at the author of the fierce “Enterprise\"\nletters, and promptly issued a summons for him, with an execution against\nhis personal effects.  If James N. Gillis, brother of Steve, had not\nhappened along just then and spirited Mark Twain away to his mining-camp\nin the Tuolumne Hills, the beautiful gold watch given to the governor of\nthe Third House might have been sacrificed in the cause of friendship.",
        "As it was, he found himself presently in the far and peaceful seclusion\nof that land which Bret Harte would one day make famous with his tales of\n\"Roaring Camp” and “Sandy Bar.”  Jim Gillis was, in fact, the Truthful\nJames of Bret Harte, and his cabin on jackass Hill had been the retreat\nof Harte and many another literary wayfarer who had wandered there for\nrest and refreshment and peace.  It was said the sick were made well, and\nthe well made better, in Jim Gillis’s cabin.  There were plenty of books\nand a variety of out-of-door recreation.  One could mine there if he\nchose.  Jim would furnish the visiting author with a promising claim, and\nteach him to follow the little fan-like drift of gold specks to the\npocket of treasure somewhere up the hillside.",
        "Gillis himself had literary ability, though he never wrote.  He told his\nstories, and with his back to the open fire would weave the most amazing\ntales, invented as he went along.  His stories were generally wonderful\nadventures that had happened to his faithful companion, Stoker; and\nStoker never denied them, but would smoke and look into the fire, smiling\na little sometimes, but never saying a word.  A number of the tales later\nused by Mark Twain were first told by Jim Gillis in the cabin on Jackass\nHill.  “Dick Baker’s Cat” was one of these, the jay-bird and acorn story\nin “A Tramp Abroad” was another.  Mark Twain had little to add to these\nstories.",
        "“They are not mine, they are Jim’s,” he said, once; “but I never could\nget them to sound like Jim–they were never as good as his.”",
        "It was early in December, 1864, when Mark Twain arrived at the humble\nretreat, built of logs under a great live-oak tree, and surrounded by a\nstretch of blue-grass.  A younger Gillis boy was there at the time, and\nalso, of course, Dick Stoker and his cat, Tom Quartz, which every reader\nof “Roughing It” knows.",
        "It was the rainy season, but on pleasant days they all went pocket-\nmining, and, in January, Mark Twain, Gillis, and Stoker crossed over into\nCalaveras County and began work near Angel’s Camp, a place well known to\nreaders of Bret Harte.  They put up at a poor hotel in Angel’s, and on\ngood days worked pretty faithfully.  But it was generally raining, and\nthe food was poor.",
        "In his note-book, still preserved, Mark Twain wrote: “January 27 (1865).\n–Same old diet–same old weather–went out to the pocket-claim–had to\nrush back.”",
        "So they spent a good deal of their time around the rusty stove in the\ndilapidated tavern at Angel’s Camp.  It seemed a profitless thing to do,\nbut few experiences were profitless to Mark Twain, and certainly this one\nwas not.",
        "At this barren mining hotel there happened to be a former Illinois River\npilot named Ben Coon, a solemn, sleepy person, who dozed by the stove or\ntold slow, pointless stories to any one who would listen.  Not many would\nstay to hear him, but Jim Gillis and Mark Twain found him a delight.\nThey would let him wander on in his dull way for hours, and saw a vast\nhumor in a man to whom all tales, however trivial or absurd, were serious\nhistory.",
        "At last, one dreary afternoon, he told them about a frog–a frog that had\nbelonged to a man named Coleman, who had trained it to jump, and how the\ntrained frog had failed to win a wager because the owner of the rival\nfrog had slyly loaded the trained jumper with shot.  It was not a new\nstory in the camps, but Ben Coon made a long tale of it, and it happened\nthat neither Clemens nor Gillis had heard it before.  They thought it\namusing, and his solemn way of telling it still more so.",
        "“I don’t see no p’ints about that frog that’s better than any other\nfrog,” became a catch phrase among the mining partners; and, “I ’ain’t\ngot no frog, but if I had a frog, I’d bet you.”",
        "Out on the claim, Clemens, watching Gillis and Stoker anxiously washing,\nwould say, “I don’t see no pints about that pan o’ dirt that’s any better\nthan any other pan o’ dirt.”  And so they kept the tale going.  In his\nnote-book Mark Twain made a brief memorandum of the story for possible\nuse.",
        "The mining was rather hopeless work.  The constant and heavy rains were\ndisheartening.  Clemens hated it, and even when, one afternoon, traces of\na pocket began to appear, he rebelled as the usual chill downpour set in.",
        "“Jim,” he said, “let’s go home; we’ll freeze here.”",
        "Gillis, as usual, was washing, and Clemens carrying the water.  Gillis,\nseeing the gold “color” improving with every pan, wanted to go on washing\nand climbing toward the precious pocket, regardless of wet and cold.\nClemens, shivering and disgusted, vowed that each pail of water would be\nhis last.  His teeth were chattering, and he was wet through.  Finally he\nsaid:",
        "“Jim, I won’t carry any more water.  This work too disagreeable.”",
        "Gillis had just taken out a panful of dirt.",
        "“Bring one more pail, Sam,” he begged.",
        "“Jim I won’t do it.  I’m-freezing.”",
        "“Just one more pail, Sam!” Jim pleaded.",
        "“No, sir; not a drop–not if I knew there was a million dollars in that\npan.”",
        "Gillis tore out a page of his note-book and hastily posted a thirty-day-\nclaim notice by the pan of dirt.  Then they set out for Angel’s Camp,\nnever to return.  It kept on raining, and a letter came from Steve\nGillis, saying he had settled all the trouble in San Francisco.  Clemens\ndecided to return, and the miners left Angel’s without visiting their\nclaim again.",
        "Meantime the rain had washed away the top of the pan of dirt they had\nleft standing on the hillside, exposing a handful of nuggets, pure gold.\nTwo strangers, Austrians, happening along, gathered it up and, seeing the\nclaim notice posted by Jim Gillis, sat down to wait until it expired.\nThey did not mind the rain–not under the circumstances–and the moment\nthe thirty days were up they followed the lead a few pans farther and\ntook out, some say ten, some say twenty, thousand dollars.  In either\ncase it was a good pocket that Mark Twain missed by one pail of water.\nStill, without knowing it, he had carried away in his note-book a single\nnugget of far greater value the story of “The Jumping Frog.”",
        "He did not write it, however, immediately upon his return to San\nFrancisco.  He went back to his “Enterprise” letters and contributed some\nsketches to the Californian.  Perhaps he thought the frog story too mild\nin humor for the slope.  By and by he wrote it, and by request sent it to\nArtemus Ward to be used in a book that Ward was about to issue.  It\narrived too late, and the publisher handed it to the editor of the\n\"Saturday Press,” Henry Clapp, saying:",
        "“Here, Clapp, is something you can use in your paper.”",
        "The “Press” was struggling, and was glad to get a story so easily.  “Jim\nSmiley and his jumping Frog” appeared in the issue of November 18, 1865,\nand was at once copied and quoted far and near.  It carried the name of\nMark Twain across the mountains and the prairies of the Middle West; it\nbore it up and down the Atlantic slope.  Some one said, then or later,\nthat Mark Twain leaped into fame on the back of a jumping frog.",
        "Curiously, this did not at first please the author.  He thought the tale\npoor.  To his mother he wrote:",
        "I do not know what to write; my life is so uneventful.  I wish I was back\nthere piloting up and down the river again.  Verily, all is vanity and\nlittle worth–save piloting.",
        "To think that, after writing many an article a man might be excused for\nthinking tolerably good, those New York people should single out a\nvillainous backwoods sketch to compliment me on!–” Jim Smiley and his\nJumping Frog\"–a squib which would never have been written but to please\nArtemus Ward.",
        "However, somewhat later he changed his mind considerably, especially when\nhe heard that James Russell Lowell had pronounced the story the finest\npiece of humorous writing yet produced in America.",
        "Mark Twain remained about a year in San Francisco after his return from\nthe Gillis cabin and Angel’s Camp, adding to his prestige along the Coast\nrather than to his national reputation.  Then, in the spring of 1866 he\nwas commissioned by the “Sacramento Union” to write a series of letters\nthat would report the life, trade, agriculture, and general aspects of\nthe Hawaiian group.  He sailed in March, and his four months in those\ndelectable islands remained always to him a golden memory–an experience\nwhich he hoped some day to repeat.  He was young and eager for adventure\nthen, and he went everywhere–horseback and afoot–saw everything, did\neverything, and wrote of it all for his paper.  His letters to the\n\"Union” were widely read and quoted, and, though not especially literary,\nadded much to his journalistic standing.  He was a great sight-seer in\nthose days, and a persevering one.  No discomfort or risk discouraged\nhim.  Once, with a single daring companion, he crossed the burning floor\nof the mighty crater of Kilauea, racing across the burning lava, leaping\nwide and bottomless crevices where a misstep would have meant death.  His\nopen-air life on the river and in the mining-camps had nerved and\nhardened him for adventure.  He was thirty years old and in his physical\nprime.  His mental growth had been slower, but it was sure, and it would\nseem always to have had the right guidance at the right time.",
        "Clemens had been in the islands three months when one day Anson\nBurlingame arrived there, en route to his post as minister to China.\nWith him was his son Edward, a boy of eighteen, and General Van\nValkenburg, minister to Japan.  Young Burlingame had read about Jim\nSmiley’s jumping frog and, learning that the author was in Honolulu, but\nill after a long trip inland, sent word that the party would call on him\nnext morning.  But Mark Twain felt that he could not accept this honor,\nand, crawling out of bed, shaved himself and drove to the home of the\nAmerican minister, where the party was staying.  He made a great\nimpression with the diplomats.  It was an occasion of good stories and\nmuch laughter.  On leaving, General Van Valkenburg said to him:",
        "“California is proud of Mark Twain, and some day the American people\n     will be, too, no doubt.”  Which was certainly a good prophecy.",
        "It was only a few days later that the diplomats rendered him a great\nservice.  Report had come of the arrival at Sanpahoe of an open boat\ncontaining fifteen starving men, who had been buffeting a stormy sea for\nforty-three days–sailors from the missing ship Hornet of New York,\nwhich, it appeared, had been burned at sea.  Presently eleven of the\nrescued men were brought to Honolulu and placed in the hospital.",
        "Mark Twain recognized the great importance as news of this event.  It\nwould be a splendid beat if he could interview the castaways and be the\nfirst to get their story in his paper.  There was no cable, but a vessel\nwas sailing for San Francisco next morning.  It seemed the opportunity of\na lifetime, but he was now bedridden and could scarcely move.",
        "Then suddenly appeared in his room Anson Burlingame and his party, and,\nalmost before Mark Twain realized what was happening, he was on a cot\nand, escorted by the heads of two legations, was on his way to the\nhospital to get the precious interview.  Once there, Anson Burlingame,\nwith his gentle manner and courtly presence, drew from those enfeebled\ncastaways all the story of the burning of the vessel, followed by the\nlong privation and struggle that had lasted through forty-three fearful\ndays and across four thousand miles of stormy sea.  All that Mark Twain\nhad to do was to listen and make notes.  That night he wrote against\ntime, and next morning, just as the vessel was drifting from the dock, a\nstrong hand flung his bulky manuscript aboard and his great beat was\nsure.  The three-column story, published in the “Sacramento Union” of\nJuly 9, gave the public the first detailed history of the great disaster.\nThe telegraph carried it everywhere, and it was featured as a sensation.",
        "Mark Twain and the Burlingame party were much together during the rest of\ntheir stay in Hawaii, and Samuel Clemens never ceased to love and honor\nthe memory of Anson Burlingame.  It was proper that he should do so, for\nhe owed him much–far more than has already been told.",
        "Anson Burlingame one day said to him: “You have great ability; I believe\nyou have genius.  What you need now is the refinement of association.\nSeek companionship among men of superior intellect and character.  Refine\nyourself and your work.  Never affiliate with inferiors; always climb.”",
        "This, coming to him from a man of Burlingame’s character and position,\nwas like a gospel from some divine source.  Clemens never forgot the\nadvice.  It gave him courage, new hope, new resolve, new ideals.",
        "Burlingame came often to the hotel, and they discussed plans for Mark\nTwain’s future.  The diplomat invited the journalist to visit him in\nChina:",
        "“Come to Pekin,” he said, “and make my house your home.”",
        "Young Burlingame also came, when the patient became convalescent, and\nsuggested walks.  Once, when Clemens hesitated, the young man said:",
        "“But there is a scriptural command for you to go.”",
        "“If you can quote one, I’ll obey,” said Clemens.",
        "“Very well; the Bible says: `If any man require thee to walk a mile, go\nwith him Twain.’”",
        "The walk was taken.",
        "Mark Twain returned to California at the end of July, and went down to\nSacramento.  It was agreed that a special bill should be made for the\n\"Hornet” report.",
        "“How much do you think it ought to be, Mark?” asked one of the\nproprietors.",
        "Clemens said: “Oh, I’m a modest man; I don’t want the whole “Union\"\noffice; call it a hundred dollars a column.”",
        "There was a general laugh.  The bill was made out at that figure, and he\ntook it to the office for payment.",
        "“The cashier didn’t faint,” he wrote many years later, “but he came\nrather near it.  He sent for the proprietors, and they only laughed in\ntheir jolly fashion, and said it was robbery, but `no matter, pay it.\nIt’s all right.’  The best men that ever owned a paper.” [6]",

        "In spite of the success of his Sandwich Island letters, Samuel Clemens\nfelt, on his return to San Francisco, that his future was not bright.  He\nwas not a good, all-round newspaper man–he was special correspondent and\nsketch-writer, out of a job.",
        "He had a number of plans, but they did not promise much.  One idea was to\nmake a book from his Hawaiian material.  Another was to write magazine\narticles, beginning with one on the Hornet disaster.  He did, in fact,\nwrite the Hornet article, and its prompt acceptance by “Harper’s\nMagazine” delighted him, for it seemed a start in the right direction.  A\nthird plan was to lecture on the islands.",
        "This prospect frightened him.  He had succeeded in his “Third House\"\naddress of two years before, but then he had lectured without charge and\nfor a church benefit.  This would be a different matter.",
        "One of the proprietors of a San Francisco paper, Col. John McComb, of the\n\"Alta California,” was strong in his approval of the lecture idea.",
        "“Do it, by all means,” he said.  “Take the largest house in the city, and\ncharge a dollar a ticket.”",
        "Without waiting until his fright came back, Mark Twain hurried to the\nmanager of the Academy of Music, and engaged it for a lecture to be given\nOctober 2d (1866), and sat down and wrote his announcement.  He began by\nstating what he would speak upon, and ended with a few absurdities, such\nas:",

The trouble to begin at 8 o’clock.",
        "Mark Twain was well known in San Francisco, and was pretty sure to have a\ngood house.  But he did not realize this, and, as the evening approached,\nhis dread of failure increased.  Arriving at the theater, he entered by\nthe stage door, half expecting to find the place empty.  Then, suddenly,\nhe became more frightened than ever; peering from the wings, he saw that\nthe house was jammed–packed from the footlights to the walls!\nTerrified, his knees shaking, his tongue dry, he managed to emerge, and\nwas greeted with a roar, a crash of applause that nearly finished him.\nOnly for an instant–reaction followed; these people were his friends,\nand he was talking to them.  He forgot to be afraid, and, as the applause\ncame in great billows that rose ever higher, he felt himself borne with\nit as on a tide of happiness and success.  His evening, from beginning to\nend, was a complete triumph.  Friends declared that for descriptive\neloquence, humor, and real entertainment nothing like his address had\never been delivered.  The morning papers were enthusiastic.",
        "Mark Twain no longer hesitated as to what he should do now.  He would\nlecture.  The book idea no longer attracted him; the appearance of the\n\"Hornet” article, signed, through a printer’s error, “Mark Swain,” cooled\nhis desire to be a magazine contributor.  No matter–lecturing was the\nthing.  Dennis McCarthy, who had sold his interest in the “Enterprise,\"\nwas in San Francisco.  Clemens engaged this honest, happy-hearted\nIrishman as manager, and the two toured California and Nevada with\ncontinuous success.",
        "Those who remember Mark Twain as a lecturer in that early day say that on\nentering he would lounge loosely across the platform, his manuscript–\nwritten on wrapping-paper and carried under his arm–looking like a\nruffled hen.  His delivery they recall as being even more quaint and\ndrawling than in later life.  Once, when his lecture was over, an old man\ncame up to him and said:",
        "“Be them your natural tones of eloquence?”",
        "In those days it was thought proper that a lecturer should be introduced,\nand Clemens himself used to tell of being presented by an old miner, who\nsaid:",
        "“Ladies and gentlemen, I know only two things about this man: the first\nis that he’s never been in jail, and the second is, I don’t know why.”",
        "When he reached Virginia, his old friend Goodman said, “Sam, you don’t\nneed anybody to introduce you,” and he suggested a novel plan.  That\nnight, when the curtain rose, it showed Mark Twain seated at a piano,\nplaying and singing, as if still cub pilot on the “John J. Roe:”",
        "          “Had an old horse whose name was Methusalem,\n            Took him down and sold him in Jerusalem,\n                    A long time ago.”",
        "Pretending to be surprised and startled at the burst of applause, he\nsprang up and began to talk.  How the audience enjoyed it!",
        "Mark Twain continued his lecture tour into December, and then, on the\n15th of that month, sailed by way of the Isthmus of Panama for New York.\nHe had made some money, and was going home to see his people.  He had\nplanned to make a trip around the world later, contributing a series of\nletters to the “Alta California,” lecturing where opportunity afforded.\nHe had been on the Coast five and a half years, and to his professions of\nprinting and piloting had added three others–mining, journalism, and\nlecturing.  Also, he had acquired a measure of fame.  He could come back\nto his people with a good account of his absence and a good heart for the\nfuture.",
        "But it seems now only a chance that he arrived at all.  Crossing the\nIsthmus, he embarked for New York on what proved to be a cholera ship.\nFor a time there were one or more funerals daily.  An entry in his diary\nsays:",
        "“Since the last two hours all laughter, all levity, has ceased on the\n     ship–a settled gloom is upon the faces of the passengers.",
        "“But the winter air of the North checked the contagion, and there\n     were no new cases when New York City was reached.”",
        "Clemens remained but a short time in New York, and was presently in St.\nLouis with his mother and sister.  They thought he looked old, but he had\nnot changed in manner, and the gay banter between mother and son was soon\nas lively as ever.  He was thirty-one now, and she sixty-four, but the\nyears had made little difference.  She petted him, joked with him, and\nscolded him.  In turn, he petted and comforted and teased her.  She\ndecided he was the same Sam and always would be–a true prophecy.",
        "He visited Hannibal and lectured there, receiving an ovation that would\nhave satisfied even Tom Sawyer.  In Keokuk he lectured again, then\nreturned to St. Louis to plan his trip around the world.",
        "He was not to make a trip around the world, however–not then.  In St.\nLouis he saw the notice of the great “Quaker City” Holy Land excursion–\nthe first excursion of the kind ever planned–and was greatly taken with\nthe idea.  Impulsive as always, he wrote at once to the “Alta\nCalifornia,” proposing that they send him as their correspondent on this\ngrand ocean picnic.  The cost of passage was $1.200, and the “Alta\"\nhesitated, but Colonel McComb, already mentioned, assured his associates\nthat the investment would be sound.  The “Alta” wrote, accepting Mark\nTwain’s proposal, and agreed to pay twenty dollars each for letters.\nClemens hurried to New York to secure a berth, fearing the passenger-list\nmight be full.  Furthermore, with no one of distinction to vouch for him,\naccording to advertised requirements, he was not sure of being accepted.\nArriving in New York, he learned from an “Alta” representative that\npassage had already been reserved for him, but he still doubted his\nacceptance as one of the distinguished advertised company.  His mind was\npresently relieved on this point.  Waiting his turn at the booking-desk,\nhe heard a newspaper man inquire:",
        "“What notables are going?”",
        "A clerk, with evident pride, rattled off the names:",
        "“Lieutenant-General Sherman, Henry Ward Beecher, and Mark Twain; also,\nprobably, General Banks.”",
        "It was very pleasant to hear the clerk say that.  Not only was he\naccepted, but billed as an attraction.",
        "The “Quaker City” would not sail for two months yet, and during the\nperiod of waiting Mark Twain was far from idle.  He wrote New York\nletters to the “Alta,” and he embarked in two rather important ventures–\nhe published his first book and he delivered a lecture in New York City.",
        "Both these undertakings were planned and carried out by friends from the\nCoast.  Charles Henry Webb, who had given up his magazine to come East,\nhad collected “The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and Other\nSketches,” and, after trying in vain to find a publisher for them,\nbrought them out himself, on the 1st of May, 1867.[7]  It seems curious\nnow that any publisher should have declined the little volume, for the\nsketches, especially the frog story, had been successful, and there was\nlittle enough good American humor in print.  However, publishing was a\nmatter not lightly undertaken in those days.",
        "Mark Twain seems to have been rather pleased with the appearance of his\nfirst book.  To Bret Harte he wrote:",
        "The book is out and is handsome.  It is full of .  . . errors....but be a\nfriend and say nothing about those things.  When my hurry is over, I will\nsend you a copy to pizen the children with.",
        "The little cloth-and-gold volume, so valued by book-collectors to-day,\ncontained the frog story and twenty-six other sketches, some of which are\nstill preserved in Mark Twain’s collected works.  Most of them were not\nMark Twain’s best literature, but they were fresh and readable and suited\nthe taste of that period.  The book sold very well, and, while it did not\nbring either great fame or fortune to its author, it was by no means a\nfailure.",
        "The “hurry” mentioned in Mark Twain’s letter to Bret Harte related to his\nsecond venture–that is to say, his New York lecture, an enterprise\nmanaged by an old Comstock friend, Frank Fuller, ex-Governor of Utah.\nFuller, always a sanguine and energetic person, had proposed the lecture\nidea as soon as Mark Twain arrived in New York.  Clemens shook his head.",
        "“I have no reputation with the general public here,” he said.  “We\ncouldn’t get a baker’s dozen to hear me.”",
        "But Fuller insisted, and eventually engaged the largest hall in New York,\nthe Cooper Union.  Full of enthusiasm and excitement, he plunged into the\nbusiness of announcing and advertising his attraction, and inventing\nschemes for the sale of seats.  Clemens caught Fuller’s enthusiasm by\nspells, but between times he was deeply depressed.  Fuller had got up a\nlot of tiny hand-bills, and had arranged to hang bunches of these in the\nhorse-cars.  The little dangling clusters fascinated Clemens, and he rode\nabout to see if anybody else noticed them.  Finally, after a long time, a\npassenger pulled off one of the bills and glanced at it.  A man with him\nasked:",
        "“Who’s Mark Twain?”",
        "“Goodness knows!  I don’t.”",
        "The lecturer could not ride any farther.  He hunted up his patron.",
        "“Fuller,” he groaned, “there isn’t a sign–a ripple of interest.”",
        "Fuller assured him that things were “working underneath,” and would be\nall right.  But Clemens wrote home: “Everything looks shady, at least, if\nnot dark.”  And he added that, after hiring the largest house in New\nYork, he must play against Schuyler Colfax, Ristori, and a double troupe\nof Japanese jugglers, at other places of amusement.",
        "When the evening of the lecture approached and only a few tickets had\nbeen sold, the lecturer was desperate.",
        "“Fuller,” he said, “there’ll be nobody in Cooper Union that night but you\nand me.  I am on the verge of suicide.  I would commit suicide if I had\nthe pluck and the outfit.  You must paper the house, Fuller.  You must\nsend out a flood of complimentaries!”",
        "“Very well,” said Fuller.  “What we want this time is reputation, anyway–\nmoney is secondary.  I’ll put you before the choicest and most\nintelligent audience that was ever gathered in New York City.”",
        "Fuller immediately sent out complimentary tickets to the school-teachers\nof New York and Brooklyn–-a general invitation to come and hear Mark\nTwain’s great lecture on the Sandwich Islands.  There was nothing to do\nafter that but wait results.",
        "Mark Twain had lost faith–he did not believe anybody in New York would\ncome to hear him even on a free ticket.  When the night arrived, he drove\nwith Fuller to the Cooper Union half an hour before the lecture was to\nbegin.  Forty years later he said:",
        "“I couldn’t keep away.  I wanted to see that vast Mammoth Cave, and\n     die.  But when we got near the building, I saw all the streets were\n     blocked with people and that traffic had stopped.  I couldn’t\n     believe that these people were trying to get to the Cooper\n     Institute–but they were; and when I got to the stage, at last, the\n     house was jammed full–packed; there wasn’t room enough left for a\n     child.",
        "“I was happy and I was excited beyond expression.  I poured the\n     Sandwich Islands out on those people, and they laughed and shouted\n     to my entire content.  For an hour and fifteen minutes I was in\n     paradise.”",
        "So in its way this venture was a success.  It brought Mark Twain a good\ndeal of a reputation in New York, even if no financial profit, though, in\nspite of the flood of complimentaries, there was a cash return of\nsomething like three hundred dollars.  This went a good way toward paying\nthe expenses, while Fuller, in his royal way, insisted on making up the\ndeficit, declaring he had been paid for everything in the fun and joy of\nthe game.",
        "“Mark,” he said, “it’s all right.  The fortune didn’t come, but it will.\nThe fame has arrived; with this lecture and your book just out, you are\ngoing to be the most-talked-of man in the country.  Your letters to the\n\"Alta” and the “Tribune” will get the widest reception of any letters of\ntravel ever written.”",
        "It was early in May–the 6th–that Mark Twain had delivered his Cooper\nUnion lecture, and a month later, June 8, 1867, he sailed on the “Quaker\nCity,” with some sixty-six other “pilgrims,” on the great Holy Land\nexcursion, the story of which has been so fully and faithfully told in\n\"The Innocent Abroad.”",
        "What a wonderful thing it must have seemed in that time for a party of\nexcursionists to have a ship all to themselves to go a-gipsying in from\nport to port of antiquity and romance!  The advertised celebrities did\nnot go, none of them but Mark Twain, but no one minded, presently, for\nMark Twain’s sayings and stories kept the company sufficiently\nentertained, and sometimes he would read aloud to his fellow-passengers\nfrom the newspaper letters he was writing, and invite comment and\ncriticism.  That was entertainment for them, and it was good for him, for\nit gave him an immediate audience, always inspiring to an author.\nFurthermore, the comments offered were often of the greatest value,\nespecially suggestions from one Mrs. Fairbanks, of Cleveland, a middle-\naged, cultured woman, herself a correspondent for her husband’s paper,\nthe “Herald”.  It requires not many days for acquaintances to form on\nshipboard, and in due time a little group gathered regularly each\nafternoon to hear Mark Twain read what he had written of their day’s\ndoings, though some of it he destroyed later because Mrs. Fairbanks\nthought it not his best.",
        "All of the “pilgrims” mentioned in “The Innocents Abroad” were real\npersons.  “Dan” was Dan Slote, Mark Twain’s room-mate; the Doctor who\nconfused the guides was Dr. A. Reeves Jackson, of Chicago; the poet\nLariat was Bloodgood H. Cutter, an eccentric from Long Island; “Jack” was\nJack Van Nostrand, of New Jersey; and “Moult” and “Blucher” and “Charlie\"\nwere likewise real, the last named being Charles J. Langdon, of Elmira,\nN. Y., a boy of eighteen, whose sister would one day become Mark Twain’s\nwife.",
        "It has been said that Mark Twain first met Olivia Langdon on the “Quaker\nCity,” but this is not quite true; he met only her picture–the original\nwas not on that ship.  Charlie Langdon, boy fashion, made a sort of hero\nof the brilliant man called Mark Twain, and one day in the Bay of Smyrna\ninvited him to his cabin and exhibited his treasures, among them a dainty\nminiature of a sister at home, Olivia, a sweet, delicate creature whom\nthe boy worshiped.",
        "Samuel Clemens gazed long at the exquisite portrait and spoke of it\nreverently, for in the sweet face he seemed to find something spiritual.\nOften after that he came to young Langdon’s cabin to look at the pictured\ncountenance, in his heart dreaming of a day when he might learn to know\nits owner.",
        "We need not follow in detail here the travels of the “pilgrims” and their\nadventures.  Most of them have been fully set down in “The Innocents\nAbroad,” and with not much elaboration, for plenty of amusing things were\nhappening on a trip of that kind, and Mark Twain’s old note-books are\nfull of the real incidents that we find changed but little in the book.\nIf the adventures of Jack, Dan, and the Doctor are embroidered here and\nthere, the truth is always there, too.",
        "Yet the old note-books have a very intimate interest of their own.  It is\ncurious to be looking through them to-day, trying to realize that those\npenciled memoranda were the fresh first impressions that would presently\ngrow into the world’s most delightful book of travel; that they were set\ndown in the very midst of that historic little company that frolicked\nthrough Italy and climbed wearily the arid Syrian hills.",
        "It required five months for the “Quaker City” to make the circuit of the\nMediterranean and return to New York.  Mark Twain in that time\ncontributed fifty two or three letters to the “Alta California” and six\nto the “New York Tribune,” or an average of nearly three a week–a vast\namount of labor to be done in the midst of sight-seeing.  And what\nletters of travel they were!  The most remarkable that had been written\nup to that time.  Vivid, fearless, full of fresh color, humor, poetry,\nthey came as a revelation to a public weary of the tiresome descriptive\ndrivel of that day.  They preached a new gospel in travel literature–the\ngospel of seeing honestly and speaking frankly–a gospel that Mark Twain\nwould continue to preach during the rest of his career.",
        "Furthermore, the letters showed a great literary growth in their author.\nNo doubt the cultivated associations of the ship, the afternoon reading\naloud of his work, and Mrs. Fairbanks’s advice had much to do with this.\nBut we may believe, also, that the author’s close study of the King James\nversion of the Old Testament during the weeks of travel through Palestine\nexerted a powerful influence upon his style.  The man who had recited\n\"The Burial of Moses” to Joe Goodman, with so much feeling, could not\nfail to be mastered by the simple yet stately Bible phrase and imagery.\nMany of the fine descriptive passages in “The Innocents Abroad” have\nsomething almost Biblical in their phrasing.  The writer of this memoir\nheard in childhood “The Innocents Abroad” read aloud, and has never\nforgotten the poetic spell that fell upon him as he listened to a\nparagraph written of Tangier:",
        "“Here is a crumbled wall that was old when Columbus discovered\n     America; old when Peter the Hermit roused the knightly men of the\n     Middle Ages to arm for the first Crusade; old when Charlemagne and\n     his paladins beleaguered enchanted castles and battled with giants\n     and genii in the fabled days of the olden time; old when Christ and\n     His disciples walked the earth; stood where it stands to-day when\n     the lips of Memnon were vocal and men bought and sold in the streets\n     of ancient Thebes.”",
        "Mark Twain returned to America to find himself, if not famous, at least\nin very high repute.  The “Alta” and “Tribune” letters had carried his\nname to every corner of his native land.  He was in demand now.  To his\nmother he wrote:",
        "“I have eighteen offers to lecture, at $100 each, in various parts of\n     the Union–have declined them all .  .  .  .  Belong on the\n     “Tribune” staff and shall write occasionally.  Am offered the same\n     berth to-day on the ’Herald,’ by letter.”",
        "He was in Washington at this time, having remained in New York but one\nday.  He had accepted a secretaryship from Senator Stewart of Nevada, but\nthis arrangement was a brief one.  He required fuller freedom for his\nWashington correspondence and general literary undertakings.",
        "He had been in Washington but a few days when he received a letter that\nmeant more to him than he could possibly have dreamed at the moment.  It\nwas from Elisha Bliss, Jr., manager of the American Publishing Company,\nof Hartford, Connecticut, and it suggested gathering the Mediterranean\ntravel-letters into a book.  Bliss was a capable, energetic man, with a\ntaste for humor, and believed there was money for author and publisher in\nthe travel-book.",
        "The proposition pleased Mark Twain, who replied at once, asking for\nfurther details as to Bliss’s plan.  Somewhat later he made a trip to\nHartford, and the terms for the publication of “The Innocents Abroad\"\nwere agreed upon.  It was to be a large illustrated book for subscription\nsale, and the author was to receive five per cent of the selling price.\nBliss had offered him the choice between this royalty and ten thousand\ndollars cash.  Though much tempted by the large sum to be paid in hand,\nMark Twain decided in favor of the royalty plan–\"the best business\njudgment I ever displayed,” he used to say afterward.  He agreed to\narrange the letters for book publication, revising and rewriting where\nnecessary, and went back to Washington well pleased.  He did not realize\nthat his agreement with Bliss marked the beginning of one of the most\nnotable publishing connections in American literary history.",
        "Certainly this was a momentous period in Mark Twain’s life.  It was a\ntime of great events, and among them was one which presently would come\nto mean more to him than all the rest–the beginning of his acquaintance\nwith Olivia Langdon.",
        "One evening in late December when Samuel Clemens had come to New York to\nvisit his old “Quaker City” room-mate, Dan Slote, he found there other\nship comrades, including Jack Van Nostrand and Charlie Langdon.  It was a\njoyful occasion, but one still happier followed it.  Young Langdon’s\nfather and sister Olivia were in New York, and an evening or two later\nthe boy invited his distinguished “Quaker City” shipmate to dine with\nthem at the old St. Nicholas Hotel.  We may believe that Samuel Clemens\nwent willingly enough.  He had never forgotten the September day in the\nBay of Smyrna when he had first seen the sweet-faced miniature–now, at\nlast he looked upon the reality.",
        "Long afterward he said: “It was forty years ago.  From that day to this\nshe has never been out of my mind.”",
        "Charles Dickens gave a reading that night at Steinway Hall.  The Langdons\nattended, and Samuel Clemens with them.  He recalled long after that\nDickens wore a black velvet coat with a fiery-red flower in his\nbuttonhole, and that he read the storm scene from “David Copperfield\"–\nthe death of James Steerforth; but he remembered still more clearly the\nface and dress and the slender, girlish figure of Olivia Langdon at his\nside.",
        "Olivia Langdon was twenty-two years old at this time, delicate as the\nminiature he had seen, though no longer in the fragile health of her\ngirlhood.  Gentle, winning, lovable, she was the family idol, and Samuel\nClemens was no less her worshiper from the first moment of their meeting.",
        "Miss Langdon, on her part, was at first rather dazed by the strange,\nbrilliant, handsome man, so unlike anything she had known before.  When\nhe had gone, she had the feeling that something like a great meteor had\ncrossed her sky.  To her brother, who was eager for her good opinion of\nhis celebrity, she admitted her admiration, if not her entire approval.\nHer father had no doubts.  With a keen sense of humor and a deep\nknowledge of men, Jervis Langdon was from that first evening the devoted\nchampion of Mark Twain.  Clemens saw Miss Langdon again during the\nholidays, and by the week’s end he had planned to visit Elmira–soon.\nBut fate managed differently.  He was not to see Elmira for the better\npart of a year.",
        "He returned to his work in Washington–the preparation of the book and\nhis newspaper correspondence.  It was in connection with the latter that\nhe first met General Grant, then not yet President.  The incident,\ncharacteristic of both men, is worth remembering.  Mark Twain had called\nby permission, elated with the prospect of an interview.  But when he\nlooked into the square, smileless face of the soldier he found himself,\nfor the first time in his life, without anything particular to say.\nGrant nodded slightly and waited.  His caller wished something would\nhappen.  It did.  His inspiration returned.",
        "“General,” he said, “I seem to be slightly embarrassed.  Are you?”",
        "Grant’s severity broke up in laughter.  There were no further\ndifficulties.",
        "Work on the book did not go so well.  There were many distractions in\nWashington, and Clemens did not like the climate there.  Then he found\nthe “Alta” had copyrighted his letters and were reluctant to allow him to\nuse them.  He decided to sail at once for San Francisco.  If he could\narrange the “Alta” matter, he would finish his work there.  He did, in\nfact, carry out this plan, and all difficulties vanished on his arrival.\nHis old friend Colonel McComb obtained for him free use of the “Alta\"\nletters.  The way was now clear for his book.  His immediate need of\nfunds, however, induced him to lecture.  In May he wrote Bliss:",
        "“I lectured here on the trip (the Quaker City excursion) the other\n     night; $1,600 in gold in the house; every seat taken and paid for\n     before night.”",
        "He settled down to work now with his usual energy, editing and rewriting,\nand in two months had the big manuscript ready for delivery.",
        "Mark Twain’s friends urged him to delay his return to “the States” long\nenough to make a lecture tour through California and Nevada.  He must\ngive his new lecture, they told him, to his old friends.  He agreed, and\nwas received at Virginia City, Carson, and elsewhere like a returning\nconqueror.  He lectured again in San Francisco just before sailing.",
        "The announcement of his lecture was highly original.  It was a hand-bill\nsupposed to have been issued by the foremost citizens of San Francisco, a\nmock protest against his lecture, urging him to return to New York\nwithout inflicting himself on them again.  On the same bill was printed\nhis reply.  In it he said:",
        "“I will torment the people if I want to.  It only costs them $1\n     apiece, and, if they can’t stand it, what do they stay here for?”",
        "He promised positively to sail on July 6th if they would let him talk\njust this once.",
        "There was a good deal more of this drollery on the bill, which ended with\nthe announcement that he would appear at the Mercantile Library on July\n2d.  It is unnecessary to say that the place was jammed on that evening.\nIt was probably the greatest lecture event San Francisco has ever known.\nFour days later, July 6, 1868, Mark Twain sailed, via Aspinwall, for New\nYork, and on the 28th delivered the manuscript of “The Innocents Abroad,\nor the New Pilgrim’s Progress,” to his Hartford publisher.",
        "Samuel Clemens now decided to pay his long-deferred visit to the Langdon\nhome in Elmira.  Through Charlie Langdon he got the invitation renewed,\nand for a glorious week enjoyed the generous hospitality of the beautiful\nLangdon home and the society of fair Olivia Langdon–Livy, as they called\nher–realizing more and more that for him there could never be any other\nwoman in the world.  He spoke no word of this to her, but on the morning\nof the day when his visit would end he relieved himself to Charlie\nLangdon, much to the young man’s alarm.  Greatly as he admired Mark Twain\nhimself, he did not think him, or, indeed, any man, good enough for\n\"Livy,” whom he considered little short of a saint.  Clemens was to take\na train that evening, but young Langdon said, when he recovered:",
        "“Look here, Clemens, there’s a train in half an hour.  I’ll help you\ncatch it.  Don’t wait until tonight; go now!”",
        "Mark Twain shook his head.",
        "“No, Charlie,” he said, in his gentle drawl.  “I want to enjoy your\nhospitality a little longer.  I promise to be circumspect, and I’ll go\nto-night.”",
        "That night after dinner, when it was time to take the train, a light two-\nseated wagon was at the gate.  Young Langdon and his guest took the back\nseat, which, for some reason, had not been locked in its place.  The\nhorse started with a quick forward spring, and the seat with its two\noccupants described a circle and landed with force on the cobbled street.",
        "Neither passenger was seriously hurt–only dazed a little for the moment.\nBut to Mark Twain there came a sudden inspiration.  Here was a chance to\nprolong his visit.  When the Langdon household gathered with\nrestoratives, he did not recover at once, and allowed himself to be\nsupported to an arm-chair for further remedies.  Livy Langdon showed\nespecial anxiety.",
        "He was not allowed to go, now, of course; he must stay until it was\ncertain that his recovery was complete.  Perhaps he had been internally\ninjured.  His visit was prolonged two weeks, two weeks of pure happiness,\nand when he went away he had fully resolved to win Livy Langdon for his\nwife.",
        "Mark Twain now went to Hartford to look after his book proofs, and there\nfor the first time met the Rev. Joseph H. Twichell, who would become his\nclosest friend.  The two men, so different in many ways, always had the\nfondest admiration for each other; each recognized in the other great\ncourage, humanity, and sympathy.  Clemens would gladly have remained in\nHartford that winter.  Twichell presented him to many congenial people,\nincluding Charles Dudley Warner, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and other writing\nfolk.  But flattering lecture offers were made him, and he could no\nlonger refuse.",
        "He called his new lecture “The Vandal Abroad,” it being chapters from the\nforthcoming book, and it was a great success everywhere.  His houses were\ncrowded; the newspapers were enthusiastic.  His delivery was described as\na “long, monotonous drawl, with fun invariably coming in at the end of a\nsentence–after a pause.”  He began to be recognized everywhere–to have\ngreat popularity.  People came out on the street to see him pass.",
        "Many of his lecture engagements were in central New York, no great\ndistance from Elmira.  He had a standing invitation to visit the Langdon\nhome, and went when he could.  His courtship, however, was not entirely\nsmooth.  Much as Mr. Langdon honored his gifts and admired him\npersonally, he feared that his daughter, who had known so little of life\nand the outside world, and the brilliant traveler, lecturer, author,\nmight not find happiness in marriage.  Many absurd stories have been told\nof Mark Twain’s first interview with Jervis Langdon on this subject, but\nthese are without foundation.  It was an earnest discussion on both\nsides, and left Samuel Clemens rather crestfallen, though not without\nhope.  More than once the subject was discussed between the two men that\nwinter as the lecturer came and went, his fame always growing.  In time\nthe Langdon household had grown to feel that he belonged to them.  It\nwould be only a step further to make him really one of the family.",
        "There was no positive engagement at first, for it was agreed between\nClemens and Jervis Langdon that letters should be sent by Mr. Langdon to\nthose who had known his would-be son-in-law earlier, with inquiries as to\nhis past conduct and general character.  It was a good while till answers\nto these came, and when they arrived Samuel Clemens was on hand to learn\nthe result.  Mr. Langdon had a rather solemn look when they were alone\ntogether.",
        "Clemens asked, “You’ve heard from those gentlemen out there?”",
        "“Yes, and from another gentlemen I wrote to concerning you.”",
        "“They don’t appear to have been very enthusiastic, from your manner.”",
        "“Well, yes, some of them were.”",
        "“I suppose I may ask what particular form their emotion took.”",
        "“Oh, yes, yes; they agree unanimously that you are a brilliant, able man-\n-a man with a future, and that you would make about the worst husband on\nrecord.”",
        "The applicant had a forlorn look.  “There is nothing very evasive about\nthat,” he said.",
        "Langdon reflected.",
        "“Haven’t you any other friend that you could suggest?”",
        "“Apparently none whose testimony would be valuable.”",
        "Jervis Langdon held out his hand.",
        "“You have at least one,” he said. “I believe in you.  I know you better\nthen they do.”",
        "The engagement of Samuel Langhorne Clemens and Olivia Lewis Langdon was\nratified next day, February 4, 1869.  To Jane Clemens her son wrote:\n\"She is a little body, but she hasn’t her peer in Christendom.”",
        "Clemens closed his lecture tour in March with a profit of something more\nthan eight thousand dollars.  He had intended to make a spring tour of\nCalifornia, but went to Elmira instead.  The revised proofs of his book\nwere coming now, and he and gentle Livy Langdon read them together.\nSamuel Clemens realized presently that the girl he had chosen had a\ndelicate literary judgment.  She became all at once his editor, a\nposition she held until her death.  Her refining influence had much to do\nwith Mark Twain’s success, then and later, and the world owes her a debt\nof gratitude.  Through that first pleasant summer these two worked at the\nproofs and planned for their future, and were very happy indeed.",
        "It was about the end of July when the big book appeared at last, and its\nsuccess was startling.  Nothing like it had ever been known before.  Mark\nTwain’s name seemed suddenly to be on every tongue–his book in\neverybody’s hands.  From one end of the country to the other, readers\nwere hailing him as the greatest humorist and descriptive writer of\nmodern times.  By the first of the year more than thirty thousand volumes\nhad been sold.  It was a book of travel; its lowest price was three and a\nhalf dollars; the record has not been equaled since.  In England also\nlarge editions had been issued, and translations into foreign languages\nwere under way.  It was and is a great book, because it is a human book–\na book written straight from the heart.",
        "If Mark Twain had not been famous before, he was so now.  Indeed, it is\ndoubtful if any other American author was so widely known and read as the\nauthor of “The Innocents Abroad” during that first half-year after its\npublication.",
        "Yet for some reason he still did not regard himself as a literary man.\nHe was a journalist, and began to look about for a paper which he could\nbuy-his idea being to establish a business and a home.  Through Mr.\nLangdon’s assistance, he finally obtained an interest in the “Buffalo\nExpress,” and the end of the year 1869 found him established as its\nassociate editor, though still lecturing here and there, because his\nwedding-day was near at hand and there must be no lack of funds.",
        "It was the 2d of February, 1870, that Samuel Clemens and Olivia Langdon\nwere married.  A few days before, he sat down one night and wrote to\nJim Gillis, away out in the Tuolumne Hills, and told him of all his good\nfortune, recalling their days at Angel’s Camp, and the absurd frog story,\nwhich he said had been the beginning of his happiness.  In the five years\nsince then he had traveled a long way, but he had not forgotten.",
        "On the morning of his wedding-day Mark Twain received from his publisher\na check for four thousand dollars, his profit from three months’ sales of\nthe book, a handsome sum.",
        "The wedding was mainly a family affair.  Twichell and his wife came over\nfrom Hartford–Twichell to assist Thomas K. Beecher in performing the\nceremony.  Jane Clemens could not come, nor Orion and his wife; but\nPamela, a widow now, and her daughter Annie, grown to a young lady,\narrived from St. Louis.  Not more than one hundred guests gathered in the\nstately Langdon parlors that in future would hold so much history for\nSamuel Clemens and Olivia Langdon–so much of the story of life and death\nthat thus made its beginning there.  Then, at seven in the evening, they\nwere married, and the bride danced with her father, and the Rev. Thomas\nBeecher declared she wore the longest gloves he had ever seen.",
        "It was the next afternoon that the wedding-party set out for Buffalo.\nThrough a Mr. Slee, an agent of Mr. Langdon’s, Clemens had engaged, as he\nsupposed, a boarding-house, quiet and unpretentious, for he meant to\nstart his married life modestly.  Jervis Langdon had a plan of his own\nfor his daughter, but Clemens had received no inkling of it, and had full\nfaith in the letter which Slee had written, saying that a choice and\ninexpensive boarding-house had been secured.  When, about nine o’clock\nthat night, the party reached Buffalo, they found Mr. Slee waiting at the\nstation.  There was snow, and sleighs had been ordered.  Soon after\nstarting, the sleigh of the bride and groom fell behind and drove about\nrather aimlessly, apparently going nowhere in particular.  This disturbed\nthe groom, who thought they should arrive first and receive their guests.\nHe criticized Slee for selecting a house that was so hard to find, and\nwhen they turned at last into Delaware Avenue, Buffalo’s finest street,\nand stopped before a handsome house, he was troubled concerning the\nrichness of the locality.",
        "They were on the steps when the door opened and a perfect fairyland of\nlights and decoration was revealed within.  The friends who had gone\nahead came out with greetings to lead in the bride and groom.  Servants\nhurried forward to take bags and wraps.  They were ushered inside; they\nwere led through beautiful rooms, all newly appointed and garnished.  The\nbridegroom was dazed, unable to understand the meaning of it all–the\ncompleteness of their possession.  At last his young wife put her hand\nupon his arm.",
        "“Don’t you understand, Youth?” she said–that was always her name for\nhim.  “Don’t you understand?  It is ours, all ours–everything–a gift\nfrom father.”",
        "But still he could not quite grasp it, and Mr. Langdon brought a little\nbox and, opening it, handed them the deeds.",
        "Nobody quite remembers what was the first remark that Samuel Clemens\nmade, but either then or a little later he said:",
        "“Mr. Langdon, whenever you are in Buffalo, if it’s twice a year, come\nright here.  Bring your bag and stay overnight if you want to.  It\nsha’n’t cost you a cent.”",
        "Mark Twain remained less than two years in Buffalo–a period of much\naffliction.",
        "In the beginning, prospects could hardly have been brighter.  His\nbeautiful home seemed perfect.  At the office he found work to his hand,\nand enjoyed it.  His co-editor, J. W. Larned, who sat across the table\nfrom him, used to tell later how Mark enjoyed his work as he went along–\nthe humor of it–frequently laughing as some new absurdity came into his\nmind.  He was not very regular in his arrivals, but he worked long hours\nand turned in a vast amount of “copy\"–skits, sketches, editorials, and\ncomments of a varied sort.  Not all of it was humorous; he would stop\nwork any time on an amusing sketch to attack some abuse or denounce an\ninjustice, and he did it in scorching words that made offenders pause.\nOnce, when two practical jokers had sent in a marriage notice of persons\nnot even contemplating matrimony, he wrote:",
        "“This deceit has been practised maliciously by a couple of men whose\n     small souls will escape through their pores some day if they do not\n     varnish their hides.”",
        "In May he considerably increased his income by undertaking a department\ncalled “Memoranda” for the new “Galaxy” magazine.  The outlook was now so\npromising that to his lecture agent, James Redpath, he wrote:",
        "“DEAR RED: I’m not going to lecture any more forever.  I’ve got\n     things ciphered down to a fraction now.  I know just about what it\n     will cost to live, and I can make the money without lecturing.\n     Therefore, old man, count me out.”",
        "And in a second letter:",
        "“I guess I’m out of the field permanently.  Have got a lovely wife, a\n     lovely house bewitchingly furnished, a lovely carriage, and a\n     coachman whose style and dignity are simply awe-inspiring, nothing\n     less; and I’m making more money than necessary, by considerable, and\n     therefore why crucify myself nightly on the platform!  The\n     subscriber will have to be excused, for the present season, at\n     least.”",
        "The little household on Delaware Avenue was indeed a happy place during\nthose early months.  Neither Clemens nor his wife in those days cared\nmuch for society, preferring the comfort of their own home.  Once when a\nnew family moved into a house across the way they postponed calling until\nthey felt ashamed.  Clemens himself called first.  One Sunday morning he\nnoticed smoke pouring from an upper window of their neighbor’s house.\nThe occupants, seated on the veranda, evidently did not suspect their\ndanger.  Clemens stepped across to the gate and, bowing politely, said:",
        "“My name is Clemens; we ought to have called on you before, and I\n     beg your pardon for intruding now in this informal way, but your\n     house is on fire.”",
        "It was at the moment when life seemed at its best that shadows gathered.\nJervis Langdon had never accepted his son-in-law’s playful invitation to\n\"bring his bag and stay overnight,” and now the time for it was past.  In\nthe spring his health gave way.  Mrs. Clemens, who adored him, went to\nElmira to be at his bedside.  Three months of lingering illness brought\nthe end.  His death was a great blow to Mrs. Clemens, and the strain of\nwatching had been very hard.  Her own health, never robust, became poor.\nA girlhood friend, who came to cheer her with a visit, was taken down\nwith typhoid fever.  Another long period of anxiety and nursing ended\nwith the young woman’s death in the Clemens home.",
        "To Mark Twain and his wife it seemed that their bright days were over.\nThe arrival of little Langdon Clemens, in November, brought happiness,\nbut his delicate hold on life was so uncertain that the burden of anxiety\ngrew.",
        "Amid so many distractions Clemens found his work hard.  His “Memoranda\"\ndepartment in the “Galaxy” must be filled and be bright and readable.\nHis work at the office could not be neglected.  Then, too, he had made a\ncontract with Bliss for another book “Roughing It\"–and he was trying to\nget started on that.",
        "He began to chafe under the relentless demands of the magazine and\nnewspaper.  Finally he could stand it no longer.  He sold his interest in\nthe “Express,” at a loss, and gave up the “Memoranda.”  In the closing\nnumber (April, 1871) he said:",
        "“For the last eight months, with hardly an interval, I have had for\n     my fellows and comrades, night and day, doctors and watchers of the\n     sick!  During these eight months death has taken two members of my\n     home circle and malignantly threatened two others.  All this I have\n     experienced, yet all the time have been under contract to furnish\n     humorous matter, once a month, for this magazine ....  To be a\n     pirate on a low salary and with no share of the profits in the\n     business used to be my idea of an uncomfortable occupation, but I\n     have other views now.  To be a monthly humorist in a cheerless time\n     is drearier.”",
        "The Clemens family now went to Elmira, to Quarry Farm–a beautiful\nhilltop place, overlooking the river and the town–the home of Mrs.\nClemens’s sister, Mrs. Theodore Crane.  They did not expect to return to\nBuffalo, and the house there was offered for sale.  For them the sunlight\nhad gone out of it.",
        "Matters went better at Quarry Farm.  The invalids gained strength; work\non the book progressed.  The Clemenses that year fell in love with the\nplace that was to mean so much to them in the many summers to come.",
        "Mark Twain was not altogether satisfied, however, with his writing.  He\nwas afraid it was not up to his literary standard.  His spirits were at\nlow ebb when his old first editor, Joe Goodman, came East and stopped off\nat Elmira.  Clemens hurried him out to the farm, and, eagerly putting the\nchapters of “Roughing It” into his hands, asked him to read them.\nGoodman seated himself comfortably by a window, while the author went\nover to a table and pretended to write, but was really watching Goodman,\nwho read page after page solemnly and with great deliberation.  Presently\nMark Twain could stand it no longer.  He threw down his pen, exclaiming:",
        "“I knew it!  I knew it!  I’ve been writing nothing but rot.  You have sat\nthere all this time reading without a smile–but I am not wholly to\nblame.  I have been trying to write a funny book with dead people and\nsickness everywhere.  Oh, Joe, I wish I could die myself!”",
        "“Mark,” said Goodman, “I was reading critically, not for amusement, and\nso far as I have read, and can judge, this is one of the best things you\nhave ever written.  I have found it perfectly absorbing.  You are doing a\ngreat book!”",
        "That was enough.  Clemens knew that Goodman never spoke idly of such\nmatters.  The author of “Roughing It” was a changed man–full of\nenthusiasm, eager to go on.  He offered to pay Goodman a salary to stay\nand furnish inspiration.  Goodman declined the salary, but remained for\nseveral weeks, and during long walks which the two friends took over the\nhills gave advice, recalled good material, and was a great help and\ncomfort.  In May, Clemens wrote to Bliss that he had twelve hundred\nmanuscript pages of the new book written and was turning out from thirty\nto sixty-five per day.  He was in high spirits.  The family health had\nimproved–once more prospects were bright.  He even allowed Redpath to\npersuade him to lecture again during the coming season.  Selling his\nshare of the “Express” at a loss had left Mark Twain considerably in debt\nand lecture profits would furnish the quickest means of payment.",
        "When the summer ended the Clemens family took up residence in Hartford,\nConnecticut, in the fine old Hooker house, on Forest Street.  Hartford\nheld many attractions for Mark Twain.  His publishers were located there,\nalso it was the home of a distinguished group of writers, and of the Rev.\n\"Joe” Twichell.  Neither Clemens nor his wife had felt that they could\nreturn to Buffalo.  The home there was sold–its contents packed and\nshipped.  They did not see it again.",
        "His book finished, Mark Twain lectured pretty steadily that winter, often\nin the neighborhood of Boston, which was lecture headquarters.  Mark\nTwain enjoyed Boston.  In Redpath’s office one could often meet and “swap\nstories” with Josh Billings (Henry W. Shaw) and Petroleum V. Nasby (David\nR. Locke)–well-known humorists of that day–while in the strictly\nliterary circle there were William Dean Howells, Thomas Bailey Aldrich,\nBret Harte (who by this time had become famous and journeyed eastward),\nand others of their sort.  They were all young and eager and merry, then,\nand they gathered at luncheons in snug corners and talked gaily far into\nthe dimness of winter afternoons.  Harte had been immediately accorded a\nhigh place in the Boston group.  Mark Twain as a strictly literary man\nwas still regarded rather doubtfully by members of the older set–the\nBrahmins, as they were called–but the young men already hailed him\njoyfully, reveling in the fine, fearless humor of his writing, his\nwonderful talk, his boundless humanity.",
        "Mark Twain closed his lecture season in February (1872), and during the\nsame month his new book, “Roughing It,” came from the press.  He disliked\nthe lecture platform, and he felt that he could now abandon it.  He had\nmade up his loss in Buffalo and something besides.  Furthermore, the\nadvance sales on his book had been large.",
        "“Roughing It,” in fact, proved a very successful book.  Like “The\nInnocents Abroad,” it was the first of its kind, fresh in its humor and\ndescription, true in its picture of the frontier life he had known.  In\nthree months forty thousand copies had been sold, and now, after more\nthan forty years, it is still a popular book.  The life it describes is\nall gone-the scenes are changed.  It is a record of a vanished time–a\ndelightful history–as delightful to-day as ever.",
        "Eighteen hundred and seventy-two was an eventful year for Mark Twain.  In\nMarch his second child, a little girl whom they named Susy, was born, and\nthree months later the boy, Langdon, died.  He had never been really\nstrong, and a heavy cold and diphtheria brought the end.",
        "Clemens did little work that summer.  He took his family to Saybrook,\nConnecticut, for the sea air, and near the end of August, when Mrs.\nClemens had regained strength and courage, he sailed for England to\ngather material for a book on English life and customs.  He felt very\nfriendly toward the English, who had been highly appreciative of his\nwritings, and he wished their better acquaintance.  He gave out no word\nof the book idea, and it seems unlikely that any one in England ever\nsuspected it.  He was there three months, and beyond some notebook\nmemoranda made during the early weeks of his stay he wrote not a line.\nHe was too delighted with everything to write a book–a book of his kind.\nIn letters home he declared the country to be as beautiful as fairyland.\nBy all classes attentions were showered upon him–honors such as he had\nnever received even in America.  W. D. Howells writes:[8]",
        "“In England rank, fashion, and culture rejoiced in him.  Lord mayors,\n     lord chief justices, and magnates of many kinds were his hosts; he\n     was desired in country houses, and his bold genius captivated the\n     favor of periodicals, that spurned the rest of our nation.”",
        "He could not make a book–a humorous book–out of these people and their\ncountry; he was too fond of them.",
        "England fairly reveled in Mark Twain.  At one of the great banquets, a\nroll of the distinguished guests was called, and the names properly\napplauded.  Mark Twain, busily engaged in low conversation with his\nneighbor, applauded without listening, vigorously or mildly, as the\nothers led.  Finally a name was followed by a great burst of long and\nvehement clapping.  This must be some very great person indeed, and Mark\nTwain, not to be outdone in his approval, stoutly kept his hands going\nwhen all others had finished.",
        "“Whose name was that we were just applauding?” he asked of his neighbor.",
        "“Mark Twain’s.”",
        "But it was no matter; they took it all as one of his jokes.  He was a\nwonder and a delight to them.  Whatever he did or said was to them\nsupremely amusing.  When, on one occasion, a speaker humorously referred\nto his American habit of carrying a cotton umbrella, his reply that he\ndid so “because it was the only kind of an umbrella that an Englishman\nwouldn’t steal,” was repeated all over England next day as one of the\nfinest examples of wit since the days of Swift.",
        "He returned to America at the end of November; promising to come back and\nlecture to them the following year.",
        "[7] From “My Mark Twain,” by W. D. Howells.",
        "But if Mark Twain could find nothing to write of in England, he found no\nlack of material in America.  That winter in Hartford, with Charles\nDudley Warner, he wrote “The Gilded Age.”  The Warners were neighbors,\nand the families visited back and forth.  One night at dinner, when the\ntwo husbands were criticizing the novels their wives were reading, the\nwives suggested that their author husbands write a better one.  The\nchallenge was accepted.  On the spur of the moment Warner and Clemens\nagreed that they would write a book together, and began it immediately.",
        "Clemens had an idea already in mind.  It was to build a romance around\nthat lovable dreamer, his mother’s cousin, James Lampton, whom the reader\nwill recall from an earlier chapter.  Without delay he set to work and\nsoon completed the first three hundred and ninety-nine pages of the new\nstory.  Warner came over and, after listening to its reading, went home\nand took up the story.  In two months the novel was complete, Warner\ndoing most of the romance, Mark Twain the character parts.  Warner’s\nportion was probably pure fiction, but Mark Twain’s chapters were full of\nhistory.",
        "Judge Hawkins and wife were Mark Twain’s father and mother; Washington\nHawkins, his brother Orion.  Their doings, with those of James Lampton as\nColonel Sellers, were, of course, elaborated, but the story of the\nTennessee land, as told in that book, is very good history indeed.  Laura\nHawkins, however, was only real in the fact that she bore the name of\nSamuel Clemens’s old playmate.  “The Gilded Age,” published later in the\nyear, was well received and sold largely.  The character of Colonel\nSellers at once took a place among the great fiction characters of the\nworld, and is probably the best known of any American creation.  His\nwatchword, “There’s millions in it!” became a byword.",
        "The Clemenses decided to build in Hartford.  They bought a plot of land\non Farmington Avenue, in the literary neighborhood, and engaged an\narchitect and builder.  By spring, the new house was well under way, and,\nmatters progressing so favorably, the owners decided to take a holiday\nwhile the work was going on.  Clemens had been eager to show England to\nhis wife; so, taking little Sissy, now a year old, they sailed in May, to\nbe gone half a year.",
        "They remained for a time in London–a period of honors and entertainment.\nIf Mark Twain had been a lion on his first visit, he was hardly less than\nroyalty now.  His rooms at the Langham Hotel were like a court.  The\nnation’s most distinguished men–among them Robert Browning, Sir John\nMillais, Lord Houghton, and Sir Charles Dilke–came to pay their\nrespects.  Authors were calling constantly.  Charles Reade and Wilkie\nCollins could not get enough of Mark Twain.  Reade proposed to join with\nhim in writing a novel, as Warner had done.  Lewis Carroll did not call,\nbeing too timid, but they met the author of “Alice in Wonderland” one\nnight at a dinner, “the shyest full-grown man, except Uncle Remiss, I\never saw,” Mark Twain once declared.",
        "Little Sissy and her father thrived on London life, but it wore on Mrs.\nClemens.  At the end of July they went quietly to Edinburgh, and settled\nat Veitch’s Hotel, on George Street.  The strain of London life had been\ntoo much for Mrs. Clemens, and her health became poor.  Unacquainted in\nEdinburgh, Clemens only remembered that Dr. John Brown, author of “Rab\nand His Friends,” lived there.  Learning the address, he walked around to\n23 Rutland Street, and made himself known.  Doctor Brown came forthwith,\nand Mrs. Clemens seemed better from the moment of his arrival.",
        "The acquaintance did not end there.  For a month the author of “Rab” and\nthe little Clemens family were together daily.  Often they went with him\nto make his round of visits.  He was always leaning out of the carriage\nto look at dogs.  It was told of him that once when he suddenly put his\nhead from a carriage window he dropped back with a disappointed look.",
        "“Who was it?” asked his companion.  “Some one you know?”",
        "“No, a dog I don’t know.”",
        "Dr. John was beloved by everybody in Scotland, and his story of “Rab” had\nwon him a world-wide following.  Children adored him.  Little Susy and he\nwere playmates, and he named her “Megalopis,” a Greek term, suggested by\nher great, dark eyes.",
        "Mark Twain kept his promise to lecture to a London audience.  On the 13th\nof October, in the Queen’s Concert Rooms, Hanover Square, he gave “Our\nFellow Savages of the Sandwich Islands.”  The house was packed.  Clemens\nwas not introduced.  He appeared on the platform in evening dress,\nassuming the character of a manager, announcing a disappointment.  Mr.\nClemens, he said, had fully expected to be present.  He paused, and loud\nmurmurs arose from the audience.  He lifted his hand and the noise\nsubsided.  Then he added, “I am happy to say that Mark Twain is present\nand will now give his lecture.”  The audience roared its approval.",
        "He continued his lectures at Hanover Square through the week, and at no\ntime in his own country had he won such a complete triumph.  He was the\ntalk of the streets.  The papers were full of him.  The “London Times\"\ndeclared his lectures had only whetted the public appetite for more.  His\nmanager, George Dolby (formerly manager for Charles Dickens), urged him\nto remain and continue the course through the winter.  Clemens finally\nagreed that he would take his family back to America and come back\nhimself within the month.  This plan he carried out.  Returning to\nLondon, he lectured steadily for two months in the big Hanover Square\nrooms, giving his “Roughing It” address, and it was only toward the end\nthat his audience showed any sign of diminishing.  There is probably no\nother such a lecture triumph on record.",
        "Mark Twain was at the pinnacle of his first glory: thirty-six, in full\nhealth, prosperous, sought by the world’s greatest, hailed in the highest\nplaces almost as a king.  Tom Sawyer’s dreams of greatness had been all\ntoo modest.  In its most dazzling moments his imagination had never led\nhim so far.",
        "It was at the end of January, 1874, when Mark Twain returned to America.\nHis reception abroad had increased his prestige at home.  Howells and\nAldrich came over from Boston to tell him what a great man he had become-\n-to renew those Boston days of three years before–to talk and talk of\nall the things between the earth and sky.  And Twichell came in, of\ncourse, and Warner, and no one took account of time, or hurried, or\nworried about anything at all.",
        "“We had two such days as the aging sun no longer shines on in his round,\"\nwrote Howells, long after, and he tells how he and Aldrich were so\ncarried away with Clemens’s success in subscription publication that on\nthe way back to Boston they planned a book to sell in that way.  It was\nto be called “Twelve Memorable Murders,” and they had made two or three\nfortunes from it by the time they reached Boston.",
        "“But the project ended there.  We never killed a single soul,” Howells\nonce confessed to the writer of this memoir.",
        "At Quarry Farm that summer Mark Twain began the writing of “The\nAdventures of Tom Sawyer.”  He had been planning for some time to set\ndown the story of those far-off days along the river-front at Hannibal,\nwith John Briggs, Tom Blankenship, and the rest of that graceless band,\nand now in the cool luxury of a little study which Mrs. Crane had built\nfor him on the hillside he set himself to spin the fabric of his youth.\nThe study was a delightful place to work.  It was octagonal in shape,\nwith windows on all sides, something like a pilot-house.  From any\ndirection the breeze could come, and there were fine views.  To Twichell\nhe wrote:",
        "“It is a cozy nest, and just room in it for a sofa, table, and three\n     or four chairs, and when the storm sweeps down the remote valley and\n     the lightning flashes behind the hills beyond, and the rain beats on\n     the roof over my head, imagine the luxury of it!”",
        "He worked steadily there that summer.  He would begin mornings, soon\nafter breakfast, keeping at it until nearly dinner-time, say until five\nor after, for it was not his habit to eat the midday meal.  Other members\nof the family did not venture near the place; if he was wanted urgently,\na horn was blown.  His work finished, he would light a cigar and,\nstepping lightly down the stone flight that led to the house-level, he\nwould find where the family had assembled and read to them his day’s\nwork.  Certainly those were golden days, and the tale of Tom and Huck and\nJoe Harper progressed.  To Dr. John Brown, in Scotland, he wrote:",
        "“I have been writing fifty pages of manuscript a day, on an average,\n     for some time now, ..  .  .  and consequently have been so wrapped\n     up in it and dead to everything else that I have fallen mighty short\n     in letter-writing.”",
        "But the inspiration of Tom and Huck gave out when the tale was half\nfinished, or perhaps it gave way to a new interest.  News came one day\nthat a writer in San Francisco, without permission, had dramatized “The\nGilded Age,” and that it was being played by John T. Raymond, an actor of\nmuch power.  Mark Twain had himself planned to dramatize the character of\nColonel Sellers and had taken out dramatic copyright.  He promptly\nstopped the California production, then wrote the dramatist a friendly\nletter, and presently bought the play of him, and set in to rewrite it.\nIt proved a great success.  Raymond played it for several years.  Colonel\nSellers on the stage became fully as popular as in the book, and very\nprofitable indeed.",
        "The new home in Hartford was ready that autumn–the beautiful house\nfinished, or nearly finished, the handsome furnishings in place.  It was\na lovely spot.  There were trees and grass–a green, shady slope that\nfell away to a quiet stream.  The house itself, quite different from the\nmost of the houses of that day, had many wings and balconies, and toward\nthe back a great veranda that looked down the shaded slope.  The kitchen\nwas not at the back.  As Mark Twain was unlike any other man that ever\nlived, so his house was not like other houses.  When asked why he built\nthe kitchen toward the street, he said:",
        "“So the servants can see the circus go by without running into the\n     front yard.”",
        "But this was probably his afterthought.  The kitchen wing extended toward\nFarmington Avenue, but it was a harmonious detail of the general plan.",
        "Many frequenters have tried to express the charm of Mark Twain’s\nhousehold.  Few have succeeded, for it lay not in the house itself, nor\nin its furnishings, beautiful as these things were, but in the\npersonality of its occupants–the daily round of their lives–the\natmosphere which they unconsciously created.  From its wide entrance-hall\nand tiny, jewel like conservatory below to the billiard-room at the top\nof the house, it seemed perfectly appointed, serenely ordered, and full\nof welcome.  The home of one of the most unusual and unaccountable\npersonalities in the world was filled with gentleness and peace.  It was\nMrs. Clemens who was chiefly responsible.  She was no longer the half-\ntimid, inexperienced girl he had married.  Association, study, and travel\nhad brought her knowledge and confidence.  When the great ones of the\nworld came to visit America’s most picturesque literary figure, she gave\nwelcome to them, and filled her place at his side with such sweet grace\nthat those who came to pay their dues to him often returned to pay still\ngreater devotion to his companion.  William Dean Howells, so often a\nvisitor there, once said to the writer:",
        "“Words cannot express Mrs. Clemens–her fineness, her delicate,\n     wonderful tact.”  And again, “She was not only a beautiful soul, but\n     a woman of singular intellectual power.”",
        "There were always visitors in the Clemens home.  Above the mantel in the\nlibrary was written: “The ornament of a house is the friends that\nfrequent it,” and the Clemens home never lacked of those ornaments, and\nthey were of the world’s best.  No distinguished person came to America\nthat did not pay a visit to Hartford and Mark Twain.  Generally it was\nnot merely a call, but a stay of days.  The welcome was always genuine,\nthe entertainment unstinted.  George Warner, a close neighbor, once said:",
        "“The Clemens house was the only one I have ever known where there\n     was never any preoccupation in the evenings and where visitors were\n     always welcome.  Clemens was the best kind of a host; his evenings\n     after dinner were an unending flow of stories.”",
        "As for friends living near, they usually came and went at will, often\nwithout the ceremony of knocking or formal leave-taking.  The two Warner\nfamines were among these, the home of Charles Dudley Warner being only a\nstep away.  Dr. and Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe were also close neighbors,\nwhile the Twichell parsonage was not far.  They were all like one great\nfamily, of which Mark Twain’s home was the central gathering-place.",
        "The Rev. Joseph H. Twichell and Mark Twain used to take many long walks\ntogether, and once they decided to walk from Hartford to Boston–about\none hundred miles.  They decided to allow three days for the trip, and\nreally started one morning, with some luncheon in a basket, and a little\nbag of useful articles.  It was a bright, brisk November day, and they\nsucceeded in getting to Westford, a distance of twenty-eight miles, that\nevening.  But they were lame and foot-sore, and next morning, when they\nhad limped six miles or so farther, Clemens telegraphed to Redpath:",
        "“We have made thirty-five miles in less than five days.  This shows\n     the thing can be done.  Shall finish now by rail.  Did you have any\n     bets on us?”",
        "He also telegraphed Howells that they were about to arrive in Boston, and\nthey did, in fact, reach the Howells home about nine o’clock, and found\nexcellent company–the Cambridge set–and a most welcome supper waiting.\nClemens and Twichell were ravenous.  Clemens demanded food immediately.\nHowells writes:",
        "“I can see him now as he stood up in the midst of our friends, with\n     his head thrown back, and in his hands a dish of those scalloped\n     oysters without which no party in Cambridge was really a party,\n     exulting in the tale of his adventure, which had abounded in the\n     most original characters and amusing incidents at every mile of\n     their progress.”",
        "The pedestrians returned to Hartford a day or two later–by train.  It\nwas during another, though less extended, tour which Twichell and Clemens\nmade that fall, that the latter got his idea for a Mississippi book.\nHowells had been pleading for something for the January “Atlantic,” of\nwhich he was now chief editor, but thus far Mark Twain’s inspiration had\nfailed.  He wrote at last, “My head won’t go,” but later, the same day,\nhe sent another hasty line.",
        "“I take back the remark that I can’t write for the January number,\n     for Twichell and I have had a long walk in the woods, and I got to\n     telling him about old Mississippi days of steam-boating glory and\n     grandeur as I saw them (during four years) from the pilot-house.  He\n     said, ’What a virgin subject to hurl into a magazine!’  I hadn’t\n     thought of that before.  Would you like a series of papers to run\n     through three months, or six, or nine–or about four months, say?”",
        "Howells wrote at once, welcoming the idea.  Clemens forthwith sent the\nfirst instalment of that marvelous series of river chapters which rank\nto-day among the very best of his work.  As pictures of the vanished\nMississippi life they are so real, so convincing, so full of charm that\nthey can never grow old.  As long as any one reads of the Mississippi\nthey will look up those chapters of Mark Twain’s piloting days.  When the\nfirst number appeared, John Hay wrote:",
        "“It is perfect; no more, no less.  I don’t see how you do it.”",
        "The “Old Times” chapter ran through seven numbers of the “Atlantic,” and\nshow Mark Twain at his very best.  They form now most of the early\nchapters of “Life on the Mississippi.”  The remainder of that book was\nadded about seven years later.",
        "Those were busy literary days for Mark Twain.  Writing the river chapters\ncarried him back, and hardly had he finished them when he took up the\nneglected story of “Tom and Huck,” and finished that under full steam.\nHe at first thought of publishing it in the “Atlantic”, but decided\nagainst this plan.  He sent Howells the manuscript to read, and received\nthe fullest praise.  Howells wrote:",
        "“It is altogether the best boy’s story I ever read.  It will be an\n     immense success.”",
        "Clemens, however, delayed publication.  He had another volume in press–a\ncollection of his sketches–among them the “Jumping Frog,” and others of\nhis California days.  The “Jumping Frog” had been translated into French,\nand in this book Mark Twain published the French version and then a\nliteral retranslation of his own, which is one of the most amusing\nfeatures in the volume.  As an example, the stranger’s remark, “I don’t\nsee no p’ints about that frog that’s any better than any other frog,” in\nthe literal retranslation becomes, “I no saw not that that frog had\nnothing of better than each frog,” and Mark Twain parenthetically adds,\n\"If that isn’t grammar gone to seed, then I count myself no judge.”",
        "“Sketches New and Old” went very well, but the book had no such sale as\n\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,” which appeared a year later, December,\n1876.  From the date of its issue it took its place as foremost of\nAmerican stories of boy life, a place that to this day it shares only\nwith “Huck Finn.”  Mark Twain’s own boy life in the little drowsy town of\nHannibal, with John Briggs and Tom Blankenship–their adventures in and\nabout the cave and river–made perfect material.  The story is full of\npure delight.  The camp on the island is a picture of boy heaven.  No boy\nthat reads it but longs for the woods and a camp-fire and some bacon\nstrips in the frying-pan.  It is all so thrillingly told and so vivid.\nWe know certainly that it must all have happened.  “The Adventures of Tom\nSawyer” has taken a place side by side with “Treasure Island.”",
        "Mark Twain was now regarded by many as the foremost American author.\nCertainly he was the most widely known.  As a national feature he rivaled\nNiagara Falls.  No civilized spot on earth that his name had not reached.\nLetters merely addressed “Mark Twain” found their way to him.  “Mark\nTwain, United States,” was a common superscription.  “Mark Twain, The\nWorld,” also reached him without delay, while “Mark Twain, Somewhere,\"\nand “Mark Twain, Anywhere,” in due time came to Hartford.  “Mark Twain,\nGod Knows Where,” likewise arrived promptly, and in his reply he said,\n\"He did.”  Then a letter addressed “The Devil Knows Where” also reached\nhim, and he answered, “He did, too.”  Surely these were the farthermost\nlimits of fame.",
        "Countless anecdotes went the rounds of the press.  Among them was one\nwhich happened to be true:",
        "Their near neighbor, Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, was leaving for Florida\none morning, and Clemens ran over early to say good-by.  On his return\nMrs. Clemens looked at him severely.",
        "“Why, Youth,” she said, “you haven’t on any collar and tie.”",
        "He said nothing, but went to his room, wrapped up those items in a neat\npackage, which he sent over by a servant to Mrs. Stowe, with the line:",
        "“Herewith receive a call from the rest of me.”",
        "Mrs. Stowe returned a witty note, in which she said he had discovered a\nnew principle–that of making calls by instalments, and asked whether in\nextreme cases a man might not send his clothes and be himself excused.",
        "Most of his work Mark Twain did at Quarry Farm.  Each summer the family–\nthere were two little girls now, Susy and Clara–went to that lovely\nplace on the hilltop above Elmira, where there were plenty of green\nfields and cows and horses and apple-trees, a spot as wonderful to them\nas John Quarles’s farm had been to their father, so long ago.  All the\nfamily loved Quarry Farm, and Mark Twain’s work went more easily there.\nHis winters were not suited to literary creation–there were too many\nsocial events, though once–it was the winter of ’76–he wrote a play\nwith Bret Harte, who came to Hartford and stayed at the Clemens home\nwhile the work was in progress.  It was a Chinese play, “Ah Sin,” and the\ntwo had a hilarious time writing it, though the result did not prove much\nof a success with the public.  Mark Twain often tried plays–one with\nHowells, among others–but the Colonel Sellers play was his only success.",
        "Grand dinners, trips to Boston and New York, guests in his own home,\noccupied much of Mark Twain’s winter season.  His leisure he gave to his\nchildren and to billiards.  He had a passion for the game, and at any\nhour of the day or night was likely to be found in the room at the top of\nthe house, knocking the balls about alone or with any visitor that he had\nenticed to that den.  He mostly received his callers there, and impressed\nthem into the game.  If they could play, well and good.  If not, so much\nthe better; he could beat them extravagantly, and he took huge delight in\nsuch contests.  Every Friday evening a party of billiard lovers–Hartford\nmen–gathered and played, and told stories, and smoked, until the room\nwas blue.  Clemens never tired of the game.  He could play all night.  He\nwould stay until the last man dropped from sheer weariness, and then go\non knocking the balls about alone.",
        "But many evenings at home–early evenings–he gave to Susy and Clara.\nThey had learned his gift as a romancer and demanded the most startling\ninventions.  They would bring him a picture requiring him to fit a story\nto it without a moment’s delay.  Once he was suddenly ordered by Clara to\nmake a story out of a plumber and a “bawgunstictor,” which, on the whole,\nwas easier than some of their requirements.  Along the book-shelves were\nornaments and pictures.  A picture of a girl whom they called “Emeline\"\nwas at one end, and at the other a cat.  Every little while they\ncompelled him to make a story beginning with the cat and ending with\nEmeline.  Always a new story, and never the other way about.  The\nliterary path from the cat to Emeline was a perilous one, but in time he\ncould have traveled it in his dreams.",
        "It was now going on ten years since the publication of “The Innocents\nAbroad,” and there was a demand for another Mark Twain book of travel.\nClemens considered the matter, and decided that a walking-tour in Europe\nmight furnish the material he wanted.  He spoke to his good friend, the\nRev. “Joe” Twichell, and invited him to become his guest on such an\nexcursion, because, as he explained, he thought he could “dig material\nenough out of Joe to make it a sound investment.”  As a matter of fact,\nhe loved Twichell’s companionship, and was always inviting him to share\nhis journeys–to Boston, to Bermuda, to Washington–wherever interest or\nfancy led him.  His plan now was to take the family to Germany in the\nspring, and let Twichell join them later for a summer tramp down through\nthe Black Forest and Switzerland.  Meantime the Clemens household took up\nthe study of German.  The children had a German nurse–others a German\nteacher.  The household atmosphere became Teutonic.  Of course it all\namused Mark Twain, as everything amused him, but he was a good student.\nIn a brief time he had a fair knowledge of every-day German and a\nreally surprising vocabulary.  The little family sailed in April (1878),\nand a few weeks later were settled in the Schloss Hotel, on a hill above\nHeidelberg, overlooking the beautiful old castle, the ancient town, with\nthe Neckar winding down the hazy valley–as fair a view as there is in\nall Germany.",
        "Clemens found a room for his work in a small house not far from the\nhotel.  On the day of his arrival he had pointed out this house and said\nhe had decided to work there–that his room would be the middle one on\nthe third floor.  Mrs. Clemens laughed, and thought the occupants of the\nhouse might be surprised when he came over to take possession.  They\namused themselves by watching “his people” and trying to make out what\nthey were like.  One day he went over that way, and, sure enough, there\nwas a sign, “Furnished Rooms,” and the one he had pointed out from the\nhotel was vacant.  It became his study forthwith.",
        "The travelers were delighted with their location.  To Howells, Clemens\nwrote:",
        "“Our bedroom has two great glass bird-cages (inclosed balconies), one\n     looking toward the Rhine Valley and sunset, the other looking up the\n     Neckar cul de sac, and, naturally, we spent nearly all our time in\n     these.  We have tables and chairs in them .  .  .  .  It must have\n     been a noble genius who devised this hotel.  Lord! how blessed is\n     the repose, the tranquillity of this place!  Only two sounds: the\n     happy clamor of the birds in the groves and the muffled music of the\n     Neckar tumbling over the opposing dikes.  It is no hardship to lie\n     awake awhile nights, for thin subdued roar has exactly the sound of\n     a steady rain beating upon a roof.  It is so healing to the spirit;\n     and it bears up the thread of one’s imaginings as the accompaniment\n     bears up a song.”",
        "Twichell was summoned for August, and wrote back eagerly at the prospect:",
        "“Oh, my!  Do you realize, Mark, what a symposium it is to be?  I do.\n     To begin with, I am thoroughly tired, and the rest will be worth\n     everything.  To walk with you and talk with you for weeks together–\n     why, it’s my dream of luxury!”",
        "Meantime the struggle with the “awful German language” went on.  Rosa,\nthe maid, was required to speak to the children only in German, though\nlittle Clara at first would have none of it.  Susy, two years older,\ntried, and really made progress, but one day she said, pathetically:",
        "“Mama, I wish Rosa was made in English.”",
        "But presently she was writing to “Aunt Sue” (Mrs. Crane) at Quarry Farm:",
        "“I know a lot of German; everybody says I know a lot.  I give you a\n     million dollars to see you, and you would give two hundred dollars\n     to see the lovely woods we see.”",
        "Twichell arrived August 1st.  Clemens met him at Baden-Baden, and they\nimmediately set forth on a tramp through the Black Forest, excursioning\nas they pleased and having a blissful time.  They did not always walk.\nThey were likely to take a carnage or a donkey-cart, or even a train,\nwhen one conveniently happened along.  They did not hurry, but idled and\ntalked and gathered flowers, or gossiped with wayside natives–\npicturesque peasants in the Black Forest costume.  In due time they\ncrossed into Switzerland and prepared to conquer the Alps.",
        "The name Mark Twain had become about as well known in Europe as it was in\nAmerica.  His face, however, was less familiar.  He was not often\nrecognized in these wanderings, and his pen-name was carefully concealed.\nIt was a relief to him not to be an object of curiosity and lavish\nattention.  Twichell’s conscience now and then prompted him to reveal the\ntruth.  In one of his letters home he wrote how a young man at a hotel\nhad especially delighted in Mark’s table conversation, and how he\n(Twichell) had later taken the young man aside and divulged the speaker’s\nidentity.",
        "“I could not forbear telling him who Mark was, and the mingled\n     surprise and pleasure his face exhibited made me glad I had done so.”",
        "They did not climb many of the Alps on foot.  They did scale the Rigi,\nafter which Mark Twain was not in the best walking trim; though later\nthey conquered Gemmi Pass–no small undertaking–that trail that winds up\nand up until the traveler has only the glaciers and white peaks and the\nlittle high-blooming flowers for company.",
        "All day long the friends would tramp and walk together, and when they did\nnot walk they would hire a diligence or any vehicle that came handy, but,\nwhatever their means of travel the joy of comradeship amid those superb\nsurroundings was the same.",
        "In Twichell’s letters home we get pleasant pictures of the Mark Twain of\nthat day:",
        "“Mark, to-day, was immensely absorbed in flowers.  He scrambled\n     around and gathered a great variety, and manifested the intensest\n     pleasure in them .  .  .  .  Mark is splendid to walk with amid such\n     grand scenery, for he talks so well about it, has such a power of\n     strong, picturesque expression.  I wish you might have heard him\n     today.  His vigorous speech nearly did justice to the things we saw.”",
        "And in another place:",
        "“He can’t bear to see the whip used, or to see a horse pull hard.\n     To-day when the driver clucked up his horse and quickened his pace a\n     little, Mark said, ’The fellow’s got the notion that we were in a\n     hurry.’”",
        "Another extract refers to an incident which Mark Twain also mentions in\n\"A Tramp Abroad:” [8]",
        "“Mark is a queer fellow.  There is nothing so delights him as a\n     swift, strong stream.  You can hardly get him to leave one when once\n     he is in the influence of its fascinations.  To throw in stones and\n     sticks seems to afford him rapture.”",
        "Twichell goes on to tell how he threw some driftwood into a racing\ntorrent and how Mark went running down-stream after it, waving and\nshouting in a sort of mad ecstasy.",
        "When a piece went over a fall and emerged to view in the foam below, he\nwould jump up and down and yell.  He acted just like a boy.",
        "Boy he was, then and always.  Like Peter Pan, he never really grew up–\nthat is, if growing up means to grow solemn and uninterested in play.",
        "Climbing the Gorner Grat with Twichell, they sat down to rest, and a lamb\nfrom a near-by flock ventured toward them.  Clemens held out his hand and\ncalled softly.  The lamb ventured nearer, curious but timid.",
        "It was a scene for a painter: the great American humorist on one side of\nthe game, and the silly little creature on the other, with the Matterhorn\nfor a background.  Mark was reminded that the time he was consuming was\nvaluable, but to no purpose.  The Gorner Grat could wait.  He held on\nwith undiscouraged perseverance till he carried his point; the lamb\nfinally put its nose in Mark’s hand, and he was happy all the rest of the\nday.",
        "“In A Tramp Abroad” Mark Twain burlesques most of the walking-tour with\nHarris (Twichell), feeling, perhaps, that he must make humor at whatever\ncost.  But to-day the other side of the picture seems more worth while.\nThat it seemed so to him, also, even at the time, we may gather from a\nletter he sent after Twichell when it was all over and Twichell was on\nhis way home:",
        "“DEAR OLD JOE,–It is actually all over!  I was so low-spirited at\n     the station yesterday, and this morning, when I woke, I couldn’t\n     seem to accept the dismal truth that you were really gone and the\n     pleasant tramping and talking at an end.  Ah, my boy!  It has been\n     such a rich holiday for me, and I feel under such deep and honest\n     obligations to you for coming.  I am putting out of my mind all\n     memory of the time when I misbehaved toward you and hurt you; I am\n     resolved to consider it forgiven, and to store up and remember only\n     the charming hours of the journey and the times when I was not\n     unworthy to be with you and share a companionship which to me stands\n     first after Livy’s.”",
        "Clemens had joined his family at Lausanne, and presently they journeyed\ndown into Italy, returning later to Germany–to Munich, where they lived\nquietly with Fraulein Dahlweiner at No. 1a Karlstrasse, while he worked\non his new book of travel.  When spring came they went to Paris, and\nlater to London, where the usual round of entertainment briefly claimed\nthem.  It was the 3d of September, 1879, when they finally reached New\nYork.  The papers said that Mark Twain had changed in his year and a half\nof absence.  He had, somehow, taken on a traveled look.  One paper\nremarked that he looked older than when he went to Germany, and that his\nhair had turned quite gray.",
        "[8] Chapter XXXIII.",
        "They went directly to Quarry Farm, where Clemens again took up work on\nhis book, which he hoped to have ready for early publication.  But his\nwriting did not go as well as he had hoped, and it was long after they\nhad returned to Hartford that the book was finally in the printer’s\nhands.",
        "Meantime he had renewed work on a story begun two years before at Quarry\nFarm.  Browsing among the books there one summer day, he happened to pick\nup “The Prince and the Page,” by Charlotte M. Yonge.  It was a story of a\nprince disguised as a blind beggar, and, as Mark Twain read, an idea came\nto him for an altogether different story, or play, of his own.  He would\nhave a prince and a pauper change places, and through a series of\nadventures learn each the trials and burdens of the other life.  He\npresently gave up the play idea, and began it as a story.  His first\nintention had been to make the story quite modern, using the late King\nEdward VII. (then Prince of Wales) as his prince, but it seemed to him\nthat it would not do to lose a prince among the slums of modern London–\nhe could not make it seem real; so he followed back through history until\nhe came to the little son of Henry VIII., Edward Tudor, and decided that\nhe would do.",
        "It was the kind of a story that Mark Twain loved to read and to write.\nBy the end of that first summer he had finished a good portion of the\nexciting adventures of “The Prince and the Pauper,” and then, as was\nlikely to happen, the inspiration waned and the manuscript was laid\naside.",
        "But with the completion of “A Tramp Abroad\"–a task which had grown\nwearisome–he turned to the luxury of romance with a glad heart.  To\nHowells he wrote that he was taking so much pleasure in the writing that\nhe wanted to make it last.",
        "“Did I ever tell you the plot of it?  It begins at 9 A.M., January\n     27, 1547 .  .  .  .  My idea is to afford a realizing sense of the\n     exceeding severity of the laws of that day by inflicting some of\n     their penalties upon the king himself, and allowing him a chance to\n     see the rest of them applied to others.”",
        "Susy and Clara Clemens were old enough now to understand the story, and\nas he finished the chapters he read them aloud to his small home\naudience–a most valuable audience, indeed, for he could judge from its\neager interest, or lack of attention, just the measure of his success.",
        "These little creatures knew all about the writing of books.  Susy’s\nearliest recollection was “Tom Sawyer” read aloud from the manuscript.\nAlso they knew about plays.  They could not remember a time when they did\nnot take part in evening charades–a favorite amusement in the Clemens\nhome.",
        "Mark Twain, who always loved his home and played with his children,\ninvented the charades and their parts for them, at first, but as they\ngrew older they did not need much help.  With the Twichell and Warner\nchildren they organized a little company for their productions, and\nentertained the assembled households.  They did not make any preparation\nfor their parts.  A word was selected and the syllables of it whispered\nto the little actors.  Then they withdrew to the hall, where all sorts of\ncostumes had been laid out for the evening, dressed their parts, and each\ngroup marched into the library, performed its syllable, and retired,\nleaving the audience of parents to guess the answer.  Now and then, even\nat this early day, they gave little plays, and of course Mark Twain could\nnot resist joining them.  In time the plays took the place of the\ncharades and became quite elaborate, with a stage and scenery, but we\nshall hear of this later on.",
        "“The Prince and the Pauper” came to an end in due season, in spite of the\nwish of both author and audience for it to go on forever.  It was not\npublished at once, for several reasons, the main one being that “A Tramp\nAbroad” had just been issued from the press, and a second book might\ninterfere with its sale.",
        "As it was, the “Tramp” proved a successful book–never as successful as\nthe “Innocents,” for neither its humor nor its description had quite the\nfresh quality of the earlier work.  In the beginning, however, the sales\nwere large, the advance orders amounting to twenty-five thousand copies,\nand the return to the author forty thousand dollars for the first year.",
        "A third little girl came to the Clemens household during the summer of\n1880.  They were then at Quarry Farm, and Clemens wrote to his friend\nTwichell:",
        "“DEAR OLD JOE,–Concerning Jean Clemens, if anybody said he “didn’t\n     see no p’ints about that frog that’s any better than any other\n     frog,” I should think he was convicting himself of being a pretty\n     poor sort of an observer. . .  It is curious to note the change in\n     the stock-quotations of the Affection Board.  Four weeks ago the\n     children put Mama at the head of the list right along, where she has\n     always been, but now:",
        "                                   Jean    \n                                   Mama\n                                   Motley    }cat\n                                   Fraulein  }cat\n                                   Papa",
        "“That is the way it stands now.  Mama is become No. 2; I have dropped\n     from 4 and become No. 5.  Some time ago it used to be nip and tuck\n     between me and the cats, but after the cats “developed” I didn’t\n     stand any more show.”",
        "Those were happy days at Quarry Farm.  The little new baby thrived on\nthat summer hilltop.",
        "Also, it may be said, the cats.  Mark Twain’s children had inherited\nhis love for cats, and at the farm were always cats of all ages and\nvarieties.  Many of the bed-time stories were about these pets–stories\ninvented by Mark Twain as he went along–stories that began anywhere and\nended nowhere, and continued indefinitely from evening to evening,\ntrailing off into dreamland.",
        "The great humorist cared less for dogs, though he was never unkind to\nthem, and once at the farm a gentle hound named Bones won his affection.\nWhen the end of the summer came and Clemens, as was his habit, started\ndown the drive ahead of the carriage, Bones, half-way to the entrance,\nwas waiting for him.  Clemens stooped down, put his arms about him, and\nbade him an affectionate good-by.",
        "Eighteen hundred and eighty was a Presidential year.  Mark Twain was for\nGeneral Garfield, and made a number of remarkable speeches in his favor.\nGeneral Grant came to Hartford during the campaign, and Mark Twain was\nchosen to make the address of welcome.  Perhaps no such address of\nwelcome was ever made before.  He began:",
        "“I am among those deputed to welcome you to the sincere and cordial\n     hospitalities of Hartford, the city of the historic and revered\n     Charter Oak, of which most of the town is built.”",
        "He seemed to be at a loss what to say next, and, leaning over, pretended\nto whisper to Grant.  Then, as if he had been prompted by the great\nsoldier, he straightened up and poured out a fervid eulogy on Grant’s\nvictories, adding, in an aside, as he finished, “I nearly forgot that\npart of my speech,” to the roaring delight of his hearers, while Grant\nhimself grimly smiled.",
        "He then spoke of the General being now out of public employment, and how\ngrateful his country was to him, and how it stood ready to reward him in\nevery conceivable–inexpensive–way.",
        "Grant had smiled more than once during the speech, and when this sentence\ncame out at the end his composure broke up altogether, while the throng\nshouted approval.  Clemens made another speech that night at the opera-\nhouse–a speech long remembered in Hartford as one of the great efforts\nof his life.",
        "A very warm friendship had grown up between Mark Twain and General Grant.\nA year earlier, on the famous soldier’s return from his trip around the\nworld, a great birthday banquet had been given him in Chicago, at which\nMark Twain’s speech had been the event of the evening.  The colonel who\nlong before had chased the young pilot-soldier through the Mississippi\nbottoms had become his conquering hero, and Grant’s admiration for\nAmerica’s foremost humorist was most hearty.  Now and again Clemens urged\nGeneral Grant to write his memoirs for publication, but the hero of many\nbattles was afraid to venture into the field of letters.  He had no\nconfidence in his ability to write.  He did not realize that the man who\nhad written “I will fight it out on this line if it takes all summer,\"\nand, later, “Let us have peace,” was capable of English as terse and\nforceful as the Latin of Caesar’s Commentaries.",
        "The “Prince and the Pauper,” delayed for one reason and another, did not\nmake its public appearance until the end of 1881.  It was issued by\nOsgood, of Boston, and was a different book in every way from any that\nMark Twain had published before.  Mrs. Clemens, who loved the story, had\ninsisted that no expense should be spared in its making, and it was,\nindeed, a handsome volume.  It was filled with beautiful pen-and-ink\ndrawings, and the binding was rich.  The dedication to its two earliest\ncritics read:",
        "“To those good-mannered and agreeable\n               children, Susy and Clara Clemens.”",
        "The story itself was unlike anything in Mark Twain’s former work.  It was\npure romance, a beautiful, idyllic tale, though not without his touch of\nhumor and humanity on every page.  And how breathlessly interesting it\nis!  We may imagine that first little audience–the “two good-mannered\nand agreeable children,” drawing up in their little chairs by the\nfireside, hanging on every paragraph of the adventures of the wandering\nprince and Tom Canty, the pauper king, eager always for more.",
        "The story, at first, was not entirely understood by the reviewers.  They\ndid not believe it could be serious.  They expected a joke in it\nsomewhere.  Some even thought they had found it.  But it was not a joke,\nit was just a simple tale–a beautiful picture of a long-vanished time.\nOne critic, wiser than the rest, said:",
        "“The characters of those two boys, twin in spirit, will rank with the\n     purest and loveliest creations of child-life in the realm of\n     fiction.”",
        "Mark Twain was now approaching the fullness of his fame and prosperity.\nThe income from his writing was large; Mrs. Clemens possessed a\nconsiderable fortune of her own; they had no debts.  Their home was as\nperfectly appointed as a home could well be, their family life was ideal.\nThey lived in the large, hospitable way which Mrs. Clemens had known in\nher youth, and which her husband, with his Southern temperament, loved.\nTheir friends were of the world’s chosen, and they were legion in number.\nThere were always guests in the Clemens home–so many, indeed, were\nconstantly coming and going that Mark Twain said he was going to set up a\nprivate ’bus to save carnage hire.  Yet he loved it all dearly, and for\nthe most part realized his happiness.",
        "Unfortunately, there were moments when he forgot that his lot was\nsatisfactory, and tried to improve it.  His Colonel Sellers imagination,\ninherited from both sides of his family, led him into financial\nadventures which were generally unprofitable.  There were no silver-mines\nin the East into which to empty money and effort, as in the old Nevada\ndays, but there were plenty of other things–inventions, stock companies,\nand the like.",
        "When a man came along with a patent steam-generator which would save\nninety per cent. of the usual coal-supply, Mark Twain invested whatever\nbank surplus he had at the moment, and saw that money no more forever.",
        "After the steam-generator came a steam-pulley, a small affair, but\npowerful enough to relieve him of thirty-two thousand dollars in a brief\ntime.",
        "A new method of marine telegraphy was offered him by the time his balance\nhad grown again, a promising contrivance, but it failed to return the\ntwenty-five thousand dollars invested in it by Mark Twain.  The list of\nsuch adventures is too long to set down here.  They differ somewhat, but\nthere is one feature common to all–none of them paid.  At last came a\nchance in which there was really a fortune.  A certain Alexander Graham\nBell, an inventor, one day appeared, offering stock in an invention for\ncarrying the human voice on an electric wire.  But Mark Twain had grown\nwise, he thought.  Long after he wrote:",
        "“I declined.  I said I did not want any more to do with wildcat\n     speculation ....  I said I didn’t want it at any price.  He (Bell)\n     became eager; and insisted I take five hundred dollars’ worth.  He\n     said he would sell me as much as I wanted for five hundred dollars;\n     offered to let me gather it up in my hands and measure it in a plug-\n     hat; said I could have a whole hatful for five hundred dollars.  But\n     I was a burnt child, and resisted all these temptations–resisted\n     them easily; went off with my money, and next day lent five thousand\n     of it to a friend who was going to go bankrupt three days later.”",
        "It was the chance of fortune thus thrown away which, perhaps, led him to\ntake up later with an engraving process–an adventure which lasted\nthrough several years and ate up a heavy sum.  Altogether, these\nexperiences in finance cost Mark Twain a fair-sized fortune, though,\nafter all, they were as nothing compared with the great type-machine\ncalamity which we shall hear of in a later chapter.",
        "Fortunately, Mark Twain was not greatly upset by his losses.  They\nexasperated him for the moment, perhaps, but his violence waned\npresently, and the whole matter was put aside forever.  His work went on\nwith slight interference.  Looking over his Mississippi chapters one day,\nhe was taken with a new interest in the river, and decided to make the\nsteamboat trip between St. Louis and New Orleans, to report the changes\nthat had taken place in his twenty-one years of absence.  His Boston\npublisher, Osgood, agreed to accompany him, and a stenographer was\nengaged to take down conversations and comments.",
        "At St. Louis they took passage on the steamer “Gold Dust\"–Clemens under\nan assumed name, though he was promptly identified.  In his book he tells\nhow the pilot recognized him and how they became friends.  Once, in later\nyears, he said:",
        "“I spent most of my time up there with him.  When we got down below\n     Cairo, where there was a big, full river–for it was high-water\n     season and there was no danger of the boat hitting anything so long\n     as she kept in the river–I had her most of the time on his watch.\n     He would lie down and sleep and leave me there to dream that the\n     years had not slipped away; that there had been no war, no mining\n     days, no literary adventures; that I was still a pilot, happy and\n     care-free as I had been twenty years before.”",
        "To heighten the illusion he had himself called regularly with the four-\no’clock watch, in order not to miss the mornings.  The points along the\nriver were nearly all new to him, everything had changed, but during\nhigh-water this mattered little.  He was a pilot again–a young fellow in\nhis twenties, speculating on the problems of existence and reading his\nfortunes in the stars.  The river had lost none of its charm for him.  To\nBixby he wrote:",
        "“I’d rather be a pilot than anything else I’ve ever been in my life.\n     How do you run Plum Point?”",
        "He met Bixby at New Orleans.  Bixby was a captain now, on the splendid\nnew Anchor Line steamer “City of Baton Rouge,” one of the last of the\nfine river boats.  Clemens made the return trip to St. Louis with Bixby\non the “Baton Rouge\"–almost exactly twenty-five years from their first\ntrip together.  To Bixby it seemed wonderfully like those old days back\nin the fifties.",
        "“Sam was making notes in his memorandum-book, just as he always did,\"\nsaid Bixby, long after, to the writer of this history.",
        "Mark Twain decided to see the river above St. Louis.  He went to Hannibal\nto spend a few days with old friends.  “Delightful days,” he wrote home,\n\"loitering around all day long, and talking with grayheads who were boys\nand girls with me thirty or forty years ago.”  He took boat for St. Paul\nand saw the upper river, which he had never seen before.  He thought the\nscenery beautiful, but he found a sadness everywhere because of the decay\nof the river trade.  In a note-book entry he said: “The romance of\nboating is gone now.  In Hannibal the steamboatman is no longer a god.”",
        "He worked at the Mississippi book that summer at the farm, but did not\nget on very well, and it was not until the following year (1883) that it\ncame from the press.  Osgood published it, and Charles L. Webster, who\nhad married Mark Twain’s niece, Annie (daughter of his sister Pamela),\nlooked after the agency sales.  Mark Twain, in fact, was preparing to\nbecome his own publisher, and this was the beginning.  Webster was a man\nof ability, and the book sold well.",
        "“Life on the Mississippi” is one of Mark Twain’s best books–one of those\nwhich will live longest.  The first twenty chapters are not excelled in\nquality anywhere in his writings.  The remainder of the book has an\ninterest of its own, but it lacks the charm of those memories of his\nyouth–the mellow light of other days which enhances all of his better\nwork.",
        "Every little while Mark Twain had a fever of play-writing, and it was\nabout this time that he collaborated with W. D. Howells on a second\nColonel Sellers play.  It was a lively combination.",
        "Once to the writer Howells said: “Clemens took one scene and I another.\nWe had loads of fun about it.  We cracked our sides laughing over it\nas we went along.  We thought it mighty good, and I think to this day it\nwas mighty good.”",
        "But actors and managers did not agree with them.  Raymond, who had played\nthe original Sellers, declared that in this play the Colonel had not\nbecome merely a visionary, but a lunatic.  The play was offered\nelsewhere, and finally Mark Twain produced it at his own expense.  But\nperhaps the public agreed with Raymond, for the venture did not pay.",
        "It was about a year after this (the winter of 1884-5) that Mark Twain\nwent back to the lecture platform–or rather, he joined with George W.\nCable in a reading-tour.  Cable had been giving readings on his own\naccount from his wonderful Creole stories, and had visited Mark Twain in\nHartford.  While there he had been taken down with the mumps, and it was\nduring his convalescence that the plan for a combined reading-tour had\nbeen made.  This was early in the year, and the tour was to begin in the\nautumn.",
        "Cable, meantime, having quite recovered, conceived a plan to repay Mark\nTwain’s hospitality.  It was to be an April-fool–a great complimentary\njoke.  A few days before the first of the month he had a “private and\nconfidential” circular letter printed, and mailed it to one hundred and\nfifty of Mark Twain’s friends and admirers in Boston, New York, and\nelsewhere, asking that they send the humorist a letter to arrive April 1,\nrequesting his autograph.  It would seem that each one receiving this\nletter must have responded to it, for on the morning of April 1st an\nimmense pile of letters was unloaded on Mark Twain’s table.  He did not\nknow what to make of it, and Mrs. Clemens, who was party to the joke,\nslyly watched results.  They were the most absurd requests for autographs\never written.  He was fooled and mystified at first, then realizing the\nnature and magnitude of the joke, he entered into it fully-delighted, of\ncourse, for it was really a fine compliment.  Some of the letters asked\nfor autographs by the yard, some by the pound.  Some commanded him to sit\ndown and copy a few chapters from “The Innocents Abroad.”  Others asked\nthat his autograph be attached to a check.  John Hay requested that he\ncopy a hymn, a few hundred lines of Young’s “Night Thoughts,” etc., and\nadded:",
        "“I want my boy to form a taste for serious and elevated poetry, and\n     it will add considerable commercial value to have it in your\n     handwriting.”",
        "Altogether, the reading of the letters gave Mark Twain a delightful day.",
        "The platform tour of Clemens and Cable that fall was a success.  They had\ngood houses, and the work of these two favorites read by the authors of\nit made a fascinating program.",
        "They continued their tour westward as far as Chicago and gave readings in\nHannibal and Keokuk.  Orion Clemens and his wife once more lived in\nKeokuk, and with them Jane Clemens, brisk and active for her eighty-one\nyears.  She had visited Hartford more than once and enjoyed “Sam’s fine\nhouse,” but she chose the West for home.  Orion Clemens, honest, earnest,\nand industrious, had somehow missed success in life.  The more prosperous\nbrother, however, made an allowance ample for all.  Mark Twain’s mother\nattended the Keokuk reading.  Later, at home, when her children asked her\nif she could still dance (she had been a great dancer in her youth), she\nrose, and in spite of her fourscore, tripped as lightly as a girl.  It\nwas the last time that Mark Twain would see her in full health.",
        "At Christmas-time Cable and Clemens took a fortnight’s holiday, and\nClemens went home to Hartford.  There a grand surprise awaited him.  Mrs.\nClemens had made an adaptation of “The Prince and the Pauper” for the\nstage, and his children, with those of the neighborhood, had learned the\nparts.  A good stage had been set up in George Warner’s home, with a\npretty drop-curtain and very good scenery indeed.  Clemens arrived in the\nlate afternoon, and felt an air of mystery in the house, but did not\nguess what it meant.  By and by he was led across the grounds to George\nWarner’s home, into a large room, and placed in a seat directly fronting\nthe stage.  Then presently the curtain went up, the play began, and he\nknew.  As he watched the little performers playing so eagerly the parts\nof his story, he was deeply moved and gratified.",
        "It was only the beginning of “The Prince and the Pauper” production.  The\nplay was soon repeated, Clemens himself taking the part of Miles Hendon.\nIn a “biography” of her father which Susy began a little later, she\nwrote:",
        "“Papa had only three days to learn the part in, but still we were all\n     sure he could do it .  .  .  .  I was the prince, and Papa and I\n     rehearsed two or three times a day for the three days before the\n     appointed evening.  Papa acted his part beautifully, and he added to\n     the scene, making it a good deal longer.  He was inexpressibly\n     funny, with his great slouch hat and gait–oh, such a gait!”",
        "Susy’s sister, Clara, took the part of Lady Jane Gray, while little Jean,\naged four, in the part of a court official, sat at a small table and\nconstantly signed state papers and death-warrants.",
        "Meantime, Mark Twain had really become a publisher.  His nephew by\nmarriage, Charles L. Webster, who, with Osgood, had handled the\n\"Mississippi” book, was now established under the firm name of Charles L.\nWebster & Co., Samuel L. Clemens being the company.  Clemens had another\nbook ready, and the new firm were to handle it throughout.",
        "The new book was a story which Mark Twain had begun one day at Quarry\nFarm, nearly eight years before.  It was to be a continuation of the\nadventures of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, especially of the latter as told\nby himself.  But the author had no great opinion of the tale and\npresently laid it aside.  Then some seven years later, after his trip\ndown the river, he felt again the inspiration of the old days, and the\nstory of Huck’s adventures had been continued and brought to a close.\nThe author believed in it by this time, and the firm of Webster & Co.\nwas really formed for the purpose of publishing it.",
        "Mark Twain took an active interest in the process.  From the pages of\n\"Life” he selected an artist–a young man named E. W. Kemble, who would\nlater become one of our foremost illustrators of Southern character.  He\nalso gave attention to the selection of the paper and the binding–even\nto the method of canvassing for the sales.  In a note to Webster, he\nwrote:",
        "“Get at your canvassing early and drive it with all your might .  .\n     .  .  If we haven’t 40,000 subscriptions we simply postpone\n     publication till we’ve got them.”",
        "Mark Twain was making himself believe that he was a business man, and in\nthis instance, at least, he seems to have made no mistake.  Some advanced\nchapters of “Huck” appeared serially in the “Century Magazine,” and the\npublic was eager for more.  By the time the “Century” chapters were\nfinished the forty thousand advance subscriptions for the book had been\ntaken, and Huck Finn’s own story, so long pushed aside and delayed, came\ngrandly into its own.  Many grown-up readers and most critics declared\nthat it was greater than the “Tom Sawyer” book, though the younger\nreaders generally like the first book the best, it being rather more in\nthe juvenile vein.  Huck’s story, in fact, was soon causing quite grown-\nup discussions–discussions as to its psychology and moral phases,\nmatters which do not interest small people, who are always on Huck’s side\nin everything, and quite willing that he should take any risk of body or\nsoul for the sake of Nigger Jim.  Poor, vagrant Ben Blankenship, hiding\nhis runaway negro in an Illinois swamp, could not dream that his\nhumanity would one day supply the moral episode for an immortal book!",
        "As literature, the story of “Huck Finn” holds a higher place than that of\n\"Tom Sawyer.”  As stories, they stand side by side, neither complete\nwithout the other, and both certain to live as long as there are real\nboys and girls to read them.",
        "Mark Twain was now a successful publisher, but his success thus far was\nnothing to what lay just ahead.  One evening he learned that General\nGrant, after heavy financial disaster, had begun writing the memoirs\nwhich he (Clemens) had urged him to undertake some years before.  Next\nmorning he called on the General to learn the particulars.  Grant had\ncontributed some articles to the “Century” war series, and felt in a mood\nto continue the work.  He had discussed with the “Century” publishers the\nmatter of a book.  Clemens suggested that such a book should be sold only\nby subscription and prophesied its enormous success.  General Grant was\nless sure.  His need of money was very great and he was anxious to get as\nmuch return as possible, but his faith was not large.  He was inclined to\nmake no special efforts in the matter of publication.  But Mark Twain\nprevailed.  Like his own Colonel Sellers, he talked glowingly and\neloquently of millions.  He first offered to direct the general to his\nown former subscription publisher, at Hartford, then finally proposed to\npublish it himself, offering Grant seventy per cent. of the net returns,\nand to pay all office expenses out of his own share.",
        "Of course there could be nothing for any publisher in such an arrangement\nunless the sales were enormous.  General Grant realized this, and at\nfirst refused to consent.  Here was a friend offering to bankrupt himself\nout of pure philanthropy, a thing he could not permit.  But Mark Twain\ncame again and again, and finally persuaded him that purely as business\nproposition the offer was warranted by the certainty of great sales.",
        "So the firm of Charles L. Webster & Co. undertook the Grant book, and the\nold soldier, broken in health and fortune, was liberally provided with\nmeans that would enable him to finish his task with his mind at peace.\nHe devoted himself steadily to the work–at first writing by hand, then\ndictating to a stenographer that Webster & Co. provided.  His disease,\ncancer, made fierce ravages, but he “fought it out on that line,” and\nwrote the last pages of his memoirs by hand when he could no longer speak\naloud.  Mark Twain was much with him, and cheered him with anecdotes and\nnews of the advance sale of his book.  In one of his memoranda of that\ntime Clemens wrote:",
        "“To-day (May 26) talked with General Grant about his and my first\n     great Missouri campaign, in 1861.  He surprised an empty camp near\n     Florida, Missouri, on Salt River, which I had been occupying a day\n     or two before.  How near he came to playing the d– with his future\n     publisher.”",
        "At Mount McGregor, a few weeks before the end, General Grant asked if any\nestimate could now be made of the sum which his family would obtain from\nhis work, and was deeply comforted by Clemens’s prompt reply that more\nthan one hundred thousand sets had already been sold, the author’s share\nof which would exceed one hundred and fifty thousand dollars.  Clemens\nadded that the gross return would probably be twice as much more.",
        "The last notes came from Grant’s hands soon after that, and a few days\nlater, July 23, 1885, his task completed, he died.  To Henry Ward Beecher\nClemens wrote:",
        "“One day he put his pencil aside and said there was nothing more to\n     do.  If I had been there I could have foretold the shock that struck\n     the world three days later.”",
        "In a memorandum estimate made by Mark Twain soon after the canvass for\nthe Grant memoirs had begun, he had prophesied that three hundred\nthousand sets of the book would be sold, and that he would pay General\nGrant in royalties $420,000.  This prophecy was more than fulfilled.  The\nfirst check paid to Mrs. Grant–the largest single royalty check in\nhistory–was for $200,000.  Later payments brought her royalty return up\nto nearly $450.000.  For once, at least, Mark Twain’s business vision had\nbeen clear.  A fortune had been realized for the Grant family.  Even his\nown share was considerable, for out of that great sale more than a\nhundred thousand dollars’ profit was realized by Webster & Co.",
        "That summer at Quarry Farm was one of the happiest they had ever known.\nMark Twain, nearing fifty, was in the fullness of his manhood and in the\nbrightest hour of his fortune.  Susy, in her childish “biography,” begun\nat this time, gives us a picture of him.  She begins:",
        "“We are a happy family!  We consist of Papa, Mama, Jean, Clara, and\n     me.  It is Papa I am writing about, and I shall have no trouble in\n     not knowing what to say about him, as he is a very striking\n     character.  Papa’s appearance has been described many times, but\n     very incorrectly; he has beautiful, curly, gray hair, not any too\n     thick or any too long, just right; a Roman nose, which greatly\n     improves the beauty of his features, kind blue eyes, and a small\n     mustache; he has a wonderfully shaped head and profile; he has a\n     very good figure–in short, is an extraordinarily fine-looking man.”",
        "“He is a very good man, and a very funny one; he has got a temper,\n     but we all have in this family.  He is the loveliest man I ever saw,\n     or ever hope to see, and oh, so absent-minded!”",
        "We may believe this is a true picture of Mark Twain at fifty.  He did not\nlook young for his years, but he was still young in spirit and body.\nSusy tells how he blew bubbles for the children, filling them with\ntobacco smoke.  Also, how he would play with the cats and come clear down\nfrom his study to see how a certain kitten was getting along.",
        "Susy adds that “there are eleven cats at the farm now,” and tells of the\nday’s occupations, but the description is too long to quote.  It reveals\na beautiful, busy life.",
        "Susy herself was a gentle, thoughtful, romantic child.  One afternoon she\ndiscovered a wonderful tangle of vines and bushes, a still, shut-in\ncorner not far from the study.  She ran breathlessly to her aunt.",
        "“Can I have it–can Clara and I have it all for our own?”",
        "The petition was granted and the place was called Helen’s Bower, for they\nwere reading “Thaddeus of Warsaw”, and the name appealed to Susy’s poetic\nfancy.  Something happened to the “bower\"–an unromantic workman mowed it\ndown–but by this time there was a little house there which Mrs. Clemens\nhad built, just for the children.  It was a complete little cottage, when\nfurnished.  There was a porch in front, with comfortable chairs.  Inside\nwere also chairs, a table, dishes, shelves, a broom, even a stove–small,\nbut practical.  They called the little house “Ellerslie,” out of Grace\nAguilar’s “Days of Robert Bruce.”  There alone, or with their Langdon\ncousins, how many happy summers they played and dreamed away.  Secluded\nby a hillside and happy trees, overlooking the hazy, distant town, it was\na world apart–a corner of story-book land.  When the end of the summer\ncame its little owners went about bidding their treasures good-by,\nclosing and kissing the gates of Ellerslie.",
        "Looking back now, Mark Twain at fifty would seem to have been in his\ngolden prime.  His family was ideal–his surroundings idyllic.  Favored\nby fortune, beloved by millions, honored now even in the highest places,\nwhat more had life to give?  When November 30th brought his birthday, one\nof the great Brahmins, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, wrote him a beautiful\npoem.  Andrew Lang, England’s foremost critic, also sent verses, while\nletters poured in from all sides.",
        "And Mark Twain realized his fortune and was disturbed by it.  To a friend\nhe said: “I am frightened at the proportions of my prosperity.  It seems\nto me that whatever I touch turns to gold.”",
        "For the time it would seem that Mark Twain had given up authorship for\nbusiness.  The success of the Grant book had filled his head with plans\nfor others of a like nature.  The memoirs of General McClellan and\nGeneral Sheridan were arranged for.  Almost any war-book was considered a\ngood venture.  And there was another plan afoot.  Pope Leo XIII., in his\nold age, had given sanction to the preparation of his memoirs, and it was\nto be published, with his blessing, by Webster & Co., of Hartford.  It\nwas generally believed that such a book would have a tremendous sale, and\nColonel Sellers himself could not have piled the figures higher than did\nhis creator in counting his prospective returns.  Every Catholic in the\nworld must have a copy of the Pope’s book, and in America alone there\nwere millions.  Webster went to Rome to consult with the Pope in person,\nand was received in private audience.  Mark Twain’s publishing firm\nseemed on the top wave of success.",
        "The McClellan and Sheridan books were issued, and, in due time, the Life\nof Pope Leo XIII.–published simultaneously in six languages–issued from\nthe press.  A large advance sale had been guaranteed by the general\ncanvassing agents–a fortunate thing, as it proved.  For, strange as it\nmay seem, the book did not prove a great success.  It is hard to explain\njust why.  Perhaps Catholics felt that there had been so many popes that\nthe life of any particular one was no great matter.  The book paid, but\nnot largely.  The McClellan and Sheridan books, likewise, were only\npartially successful.  Perhaps the public was getting tired of war\nmemoirs.  Webster & Co. undertook books of a general sort–travel,\nfiction, poetry.  Many of them did not pay.  Their business from a march\nof triumph had become a battle.  They undertook a “Library of American\nLiterature,” a work of many volumes, costly to make and even more so to\nsell.  To float this venture they were obliged to borrow large sums.",
        "It seems unfortunate that Mark Twain should have been disturbed by these\ndistracting things during what should have been his literary high-tide.\nAs it was, his business interests and cares absorbed the energy that\nmight otherwise have gone into books.  He was not entirely idle.  He did\nan occasional magazine article or story, and he began a book which he\nworked at from time to time the story of a Connecticut Yankee who\nsuddenly finds himself back in the days of King Arthur’s reign.  Webster\nwas eager to publish another book by his great literary partner, but the\nwork on it went slowly.  Then Webster broke down from two years of\noverwork, and the business management fell into other hands.  Though\nstill recognized as a great publishing-house, those within the firm of\nCharles L. Webster & Co. knew that its prospects were not bright.",
        "Furthermore, Mark Twain had finally invested in another patent, the type-\nsetting machine mentioned in a former chapter, and the demands for cash\nto promote this venture were heavy.  To his sister Pamela, about the end\nof 1887, he wrote: “The type-setter goes on forever at $3,000 a month....\nWe’ll be through with it in three or four months, I reckon\"–a false\nhope, for the three or four months would lengthen into as many years.",
        "But if there were clouds gathering in the business sky, they were not\noften allowed to cast a shadow in Mark Twain’s home.  The beautiful house\nin Hartford was a place of welcome and merriment, of many guests and of\nhappy children.  Especially of happy children: during these years–the\nlatter half of the ’eighties–when Mark Twain’s fortunes were on the\ndecline, his children were at the age to have a good time, and certainly\nthey had it.  The dramatic stage which had been first set up at George\nWarner’s for the Christmas “Prince and Pauper” performance was brought\nover and set up in the Clemens schoolroom, and every Saturday there were\nplays or rehearsals, and every little while there would be a grand\ngeneral performance in the great library downstairs, which would\naccommodate just eighty-four chairs, filled by parents of the performers\nand invited guests.  In notes dictated many years later, Mark Twain said:",
        "“We dined as we could, probably with a neighbor, and by quarter to\n     eight in the evening the hickory fire in the hall was pouring a\n     sheet of flame up the chimney, the house was in a drench of gas-\n     light from the ground floor up, the guests were arriving, and there\n     was a babble of hearty greetings, with not a voice in it that was\n     not old and familiar and affectionate; and when the curtain went up,\n     we looked out from the stage upon none but faces dear to us, none\n     but faces that were lit up with welcome for us.”",
        "He was one of the children himself, you see, and therefore on the stage\nwith the others.  Katy Leary, for thirty years in the family service,\nonce said to the author: “The children were crazy about acting, and we\nall enjoyed it as much as they did, especially Mr. Clemens, who was the\nbest actor of all.  I have never known a happier household than theirs\nwas during those years.”",
        "The plays were not all given by the children.  Mark Twain had kept up his\nGerman study, and a class met regularly in his home to struggle with the\nproblems of der, die, and das.  By and by he wrote a play for the class,\n\"Meisterschaft,” a picturesque mixture of German and English, which they\ngave twice, with great success.  It was unlike anything attempted before\nor since.  No one but Mark Twain could have written it.  Later (January,\n1888), in modified form, it was published in the “Century Magazine.”  It\nis his best work of this period.",
        "Many pleasant and amusing things could be recalled from these days if one\nonly had room.  A visit with Robert Louis Stevenson was one of them.\nStevenson was stopping at a small hotel near Washington Square, and he\nand Clemens sat on a bench in the sunshine and talked through at least\none golden afternoon.  What marvelous talk that must have been!  “Huck\nFinn” was one of Stevenson’s favorites, and once he told how he had\ninsisted on reading the book aloud to an artist who was painting his\nportrait.  The painter had protested at first, but presently had fallen a\ncomplete victim to Huck’s story.  Once, in a letter, Stevenson wrote:",
        "“My father, an old man, has been prevailed upon to read ’Roughing It’\n     (his usual amusement being found in theology), and after one evening\n     spent with the book he declared: ’I am frightened.  It cannot be\n     safe for a man at my time of life to laugh so much.’”",
        "Mark Twain had been a “mugwump” during the Blame-Cleveland campaign in\n1880, which means that he had supported the independent Democratic\ncandidate, Grover Cleveland.  He was, therefore, in high favor at the\nWhite House during both Cleveland administrations, and called there\ninformally whenever business took him to Washington.  But on one occasion\n(it was his first visit after the President’s marriage) there was to be a\nparty, and Mrs. Clemens, who could not attend, slipped a little note into\nthe pocket of his evening waistcoat, where he would be sure to find it\nwhen dressing, warning him as to his deportment.  Being presented to\nyoung Mrs. Cleveland, he handed her a card on which he had written, “He\ndidn’t,” and asked her to sign her name below those words.  Mrs.\nCleveland protested that she must know first what it was that he hadn’t\ndone, finally agreeing to sign if he would tell her immediately all about\nit, which he promised to do.  She signed, and he handed her Mrs.\nClemens’s note.  It was very brief.  It said, “Don’t wear your arctics in\nthe White House.”",
        "Mrs. Cleveland summoned a messenger and had the card mailed immediately\nto Mrs. Clemens.",
        "Absent-mindedness was characteristic of Mark Twain.  He lived so much in\nthe world within that to him the material outer world was often vague and\nshadowy.  Once when he was knocking the balls about in the billiard-room,\nGeorge, the colored butler, a favorite and privileged household\ncharacter, brought up a card.  So many canvassers came to sell him one\nthing and another that Clemens promptly assumed this to be one of them.\nGeorge insisted mildly, but firmly, that, though a stranger, the caller\nwas certainly a gentleman, and Clemens grumblingly descended the stairs.\nAs he entered the parlor the caller arose and extended his hand.  Clemens\ntook it rather limply, for he had noticed some water-colors and\nengravings leaning against the furniture as if for exhibition, and he was\ninstantly convinced that the caller was a picture-canvasser.  Inquiries\nby the stranger as to Mrs. Clemens and the children did not change Mark\nTwain’s conclusion.  He was polite, but unresponsive, and gradually\nworked the visitor toward the front door.  His inquiry as to the home of\nCharles Dudley Warner caused him to be shown eagerly in that direction.",
        "Clemens, on his way back to the billiard-room, heard Mrs. Clemens call\nhim–she was ill that day: “Youth!”",
        "“Yes, Livy.”  He went in for a word.",
        "“George brought me Mr. B.’s card.  I hope you were nice to him; the B’s\nwere so nice to us, once, in Europe, while you were gone.”",
        "“The B’s!  Why, Livy!”",
        "“Yes, of course; and I asked him to be sure to call when he came to\nHartford.”",
        "“Well, he’s been here.”",
        "“Oh Youth, have you done anything?”",
        "“Yes, of course I have.  He seemed to have some pictures to sell, so I\nsent him over to Warner’s.  I noticed he didn’t take them with him.  Land\nsakes!  Livy, what can I do?”",
        "“Go right after him–go quick!  Tell him what you have done.”",
        "He went without further delay, bareheaded and in his slippers, as usual.\nWarner and B. were in cheerful conversation.  They had met before.\nClemens entered gaily.",
        "“Oh, yes, I see!  You found him all right.  Charlie, we met Mr. B. and\nhis wife in Europe, and they made things pleasant for us.  I wanted to\ncome over here with him, but I was a good deal occupied just then.  Livy\nisn’t very well, but she seems now a good deal better; so I just followed\nalong to have a good talk, all together.”",
        "He stayed an hour, and whatever bad impression had formed in B.’s mind\nfaded long before the hour ended.  Returning home, Clemens noticed the\npictures still on the parlor floor.",
        "“George,” he said, “what pictures are these that gentleman left?”",
        "“Why, Mr. Clemens, those are our own pictures!  Mrs. Clemens had me set\nthem around to see how they would look in new places.  The gentleman was\nonly looking at them while he waited for you to come down.”",
        "It was in June, 1888, that Yale College conferred upon Mark Twain the\ndegree of Master of Arts.  He was proud of the honor, for it was\nrecognition of a kind that had not come to him before–remarkable\nrecognition, when we remember how as a child he had hated all schools and\nstudy, having ended his class-room days before he was twelve years old.\nHe could not go to New Haven at the time, but later in the year made the\nstudents a delightful address.  In his capacity of Master of Arts, he\nsaid, he had come down to New Haven to institute certain college reforms.",
        "By advice, I turned my earliest attention to the Greek department.  I\ntold the Greek Professor I had concluded to drop the use of the Greek-\nwritten character, because it is so hard to spell with and so impossible\nto read after you get it spelt.  Let us draw the curtain there.  I saw by\nwhat followed that nothing but early neglect saved him from being a very\nprofane man.",
        "He said he had given advice to the mathematical department with about the\nsame result.  The astronomy department he had found in a bad way.  He had\ndecided to transfer the professor to the law department and to put a law-\nstudent in his place.",

        "Not many great things happened to Mark Twain during this long period of\nsemi-literary inaction, but many interesting ones.  When Bill Nye, the\nhumorist, and James Whitcomb Riley joined themselves in an entertainment\ncombination, Mark Twain introduced them to their first Boston audience–a\ngreat event to them, and to Boston.  Clemens himself gave a reading now\nand then, but not for money.  Once, when Col. Richard Malcolm Johnston\nand Thomas Nelson Page were to give a reading in Baltimore, Page’s wife\nfell ill, and Colonel Johnston wired to Charles Dudley Warner, asking him\nto come in Page’s stead.  Warner, unable to go, handed the telegram to\nClemens, who promptly answered that he would come.  They read to a packed\nhouse, and when the audience had gone and the returns were counted, an\nequal amount was handed to each of the authors.  Clemens pushed his share\nover to Johnston, saying:",
        "“That’s yours, Colonel.  I’m not reading for money these days.”",
        "Colonel Johnston, to whom the sum was important, tried to thank him, but\nClemens only said:",
        "“Never mind, Colonel; it only gives me pleasure to do you that little\nfavor.  You can pass it along some day.”",
        "As a matter of fact, Mark Twain himself was beginning to be hard pressed\nfor funds at this time, but was strong in the faith that he would\npresently be a multi-millionaire.  The typesetting machine was still\ncosting a vast sum, but each week its inventor promised that a few more\nweeks or months would see it finished, and then a tide of wealth would\ncome rolling in.  Mark Twain felt that a man with ship-loads of money\nalmost in port could not properly entertain the public for pay.  He read\nfor institutions, schools, benefits, and the like, without charge.",
        "One day during the summer of 1889 a notable meeting took place in Elmira.\nOn a blazing forenoon a rather small and very hot young man, in a slow,\nsizzling hack made his way up East Hill to Quarry Faun.  He inquired for\nMark Twain, only to be told that he was at the Langdon home, down in the\ntown which the young man had just left.  So he sat for a little time on\nthe pleasant veranda, and Mrs. Crane and Susy Clemens, who were there,\nbrought him some cool milk and listened to him talk in a way which seemed\nto them very entertaining and wonderful.  When he went away he left his\ncard with a name on it strange to them–strange to the world at that\ntime.  The name was Rudyard Kipling.  Also on the card was the address\nAllahabad, and Sissy kept it, because, to her, India was fairyland.",
        "Kipling went down into Elmira and found Mark Twain.  In his book\n\"American Notes” he has left an account of that visit.  He claimed that\nhe had traveled around the world to see Mark Twain, and his article\nbegins:",
        "“You are a contemptible lot over yonder.  Some of you are\n     commissioners, and some are lieutenant-governors, and some have the\n     V. C., and a few are privileged to walk about the Mall arm in arm\n     with the viceroy; but I have seen Mark Twain this golden morning,\n     have shaken his hand, and smoked a cigar–no, two cigars–with him,\n     and talked with him for more than two hours!”",
        "But one should read the article entire–it is so worth while.  Clemens\nalso, long after, dictated an account of the meeting.",
        "Kipling came down and spent a couple of hours with me, and at the end of\nthat time I had surprised him as much as he had surprised me–and the\nhonors were easy.  I believed that he knew more than any person I had met\nbefore, and I knew that he knew that I knew less than any person he had\nmet before.  .  .  When he had gone, Mrs. Langdon wanted to know about my\nvisitor.  I said:",
        "“He is a stranger to me, but he is a most remarkable man–and I am the\nother one.  Between us we cover all knowledge.  He knows all that can be\nknown, and I know the rest.”",
        "He was a stranger to me and all the world, and remained so for twelve\nmonths, but then he became suddenly known and universally known.  .  .\nGeorge Warner came into our library one morning, in Hartford, with a\nsmall book in his hand, and asked me if I had ever heard of Rudyard\nKipling.  I said “No.”",
        "He said I would hear of him very soon, and that the noise he made would\nbe loud and continuous.  .  .  A day or two later he brought a copy of\nthe London “World” which had a sketch of Kipling in it and a mention of\nthe fact that he had traveled in the United States.  According to the\nsketch he had passed through Elmira.  This remark, with the additional\nfact that he hailed from India, attracted my attention–also Susy’s.  She\nwent to her room and brought his card from its place in the frame of her\nmirror, and the Quarry Farm visitor stood identified.",
        "A theatrical production of “The Prince and the Pauper,” dramatized by\nMrs. A. S. Richardson, was one of the events of this period.  It was a\ncharming performance, even if not a great financial success, and little\nElsie Leslie, who played the double part of the Prince and Tom Canty,\nbecame a great favorite in the Clemens home.  She was also a favorite of\nthe actor and playwright, William Gillette, [9] and once when Clemens and\nGillette were together they decided to give the little girl a surprise–a\npair of slippers, in fact, embroidered by themselves.  In his\npresentation letter to her, Mark Twain wrote:",
        "“Either of us could have thought of a single slipper, but it took both of\nus to think of two slippers.  In fact, one of us did think of one\nslipper, and then, quick as a flash, the other thought of the other one.”",
        "He apologized for his delay:",
        "“You see, it was my first attempt at art, and I couldn’t rightly get the\nhang of it, along at first.  And then I was so busy I couldn’t get a\nchance to work at home, and they wouldn’t let me embroider on the cars;\nthey said it made the other passengers afraid.  .  .  Take the slippers\nand wear them next your heart, Elsie dear, for every stitch in them is a\ntestimony of the affection which two of your loyalest friends bear you.\nEvery single stitch cost us blood.  I’ve got twice as many pores in me\nnow as I used to have .  .  .  .  Do not wear these slippers in public,\ndear; it would only excite envy; and, as like as not, somebody would try\nto shoot you.”",
        "For five years Mark Twain had not published a book.  Since the appearance\nof “Huck Finn” at the end of 1884 he had given the public only an\noccasional magazine story or article.  His business struggle and the\ntype-setter had consumed not only his fortune, but his time and energy.\nNow, at last, however, a book was ready.  “A Connecticut Yankee in King\nArthur’s Court” came from the press of Webster & Co. at the end of 1889,\na handsome book, elaborately and strikingly illustrated by Dan Beard–a\npretentious volume which Mark Twain really considered his last.  “It’s my\nswan-song, my retirement from literature permanently,” he wrote Howells,\nthough certainly he was young, fifty-four, to have reached this\nconclusion.",
        "The story of the “Yankee\"–a fanciful narrative of a skilled Yankee\nmechanic swept backward through the centuries to the dim day of Arthur\nand his Round Table–is often grotesque enough in its humor, but under it\nall is Mark Twain’s great humanity in fierce and noble protest against\nunjust laws, the tyranny of an individual or of a ruling class–\noppression of any sort.  As in “The Prince and the Pauper,” the wandering\nheir to the throne is brought in contact with cruel injustice and misery,\nso in the “Yankee” the king himself becomes one of a band of fettered\nslaves, and through degradation and horror of soul acquires mercy and\nhumility.",
        "The “Yankee in King Arthur’s Court” is a splendidly imagined tale.\nEdmund Clarence Stedman and William Dean Howells have ranked it very\nhigh.  Howells once wrote: “Of all the fanciful schemes in fiction, it\npleases me most.”  The “Yankee” has not held its place in public favor\nwith Mark Twain’s earlier books, but it is a wonderful tale, and we\ncannot afford to leave it unread.",
        "When the summer came again, Mark Twain and his family decided for once to\nforego Quarry Farm for a season in the Catskills, and presently found\nthemselves located in a cottage at Onteora in the midst of a most\ndelightful colony.  Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge, then editor of St. Nicholas,\nwas there, and Mrs. Custer and Brander Matthews and Lawrence Hutton and a\nscore of other congenial spirits.  There was constant visiting from one\ncottage to another, with frequent gatherings at the Inn, which was\ngeneral headquarters.  Susy Clemens, now eighteen, was a central figure,\nbrilliant, eager, intense, ambitious for achievement–lacking only in\nphysical strength.  She was so flower-like, it seemed always that her\nfragile body must be consumed by the flame of her spirit.  It was a happy\nsummer, but it closed sadly.  Clemens was called to Keokuk in August, to\nhis mother’s bedside.  A few weeks later came the end, and Jane Clemens\nhad closed her long and useful life.  She was in her eighty-eighth year.\nA little later, at Elmira, followed the death of Mrs. Clemens’s mother, a\nsweet and gentle woman.",
        "[9] Gillette was originally a Hartford boy.  Mark Twain had recognized\nhis ability, advanced him funds with which to complete his dramatic\neducation, and Gillette’s first engagement seems to have been with the\nColonel Sellers company.  Mark Twain often advanced money in the interest\nof education.  A young sculptor he sent to Paris for two years’ study.\nAmong others, he paid the way of two colored students through college.",
        "It was hoped that the profits from the Yankee would provide for all needs\nuntil the great sums which were to come from the type-setter should come\nrolling in.  The book did yield a large return, but, alas! the hope of\nthe type-setter, deferred year after year and month after month, never\nreached fulfilment.  Its inventor, James W. Paige, whom Mark Twain once\ncalled “a poet, a most great and genuine poet, whose sublime creations\nare written in steel,” during ten years of persistent experiment had\ncreated one of the most marvelous machines ever constructed.  It would\nset and distribute type, adjust the spaces, detect flaws–would perform,\nin fact, anything that a human being could do, with more exactness and\nfar more swiftness.  Mark Twain, himself a practical printer, seeing it\nin its earlier stages of development, and realizing what a fortune must\ncome from a perfect type-setting machine, was willing to furnish his last\ndollar to complete the invention.  But there the trouble lay.  It could\nnever be complete.  It was too intricate, too much like a human being,\ntoo easy to get out of order, too hard to set right.  Paige, fully\nconfident, always believed he was just on the verge of perfecting some\nappliance that would overcome all difficulties, and the machine finally\nconsisted of twenty thousand minutely exact parts, each of which required\nexpert workmanship and had to be fitted by hand.  Mark Twain once wrote:",
        "“All other wonderful inventions of the human brain sink pretty nearly\n     into commonplaces contrasted with this awful, mechanical miracle.”",
        "This was true, and it conveys the secret of its failure.  It was too much\nof a miracle to be reliable.  Sometimes it would run steadily for hours,\nbut then some part of its delicate mechanism would fail, and days, even\nweeks, were required to repair it.  It is all too long a story to be\ngiven here.  It has been fully told elsewhere.[10]  By the end of 1890\nMark Twain had put in all his available capital, and was heavily in debt.\nHe had spent one hundred and ninety thousand dollars on the machine, no\npenny of which would ever be returned.  Outside capital to carry on the\nenterprise was promised, but it failed him.  Still believing that there\nwere “millions in it,” he realized that for the present, at least, he\ncould do no more.",
        "Two things were clear: he must fall back on authorship for revenue, and\nhe must retrench.  In the present low stage of his fortunes he could no\nlonger afford to live in the Hartford house.  He decided to take the\nfamily abroad, where living was cheaper, and where he might be able to\nwork with fewer distractions.",
        "He began writing at a great rate articles and stories for the magazines.\nHe hunted out the old play he had written with Howells long before, and\nmade a book of it, “The American Claimant.”  Then, in June, 1891, they\nclosed the beautiful Hartford house, where for seventeen years they had\nfound an ideal home; where the children had grown through their sweet,\nearly life; where the world’s wisest had come and gone, pausing a little\nto laugh with the world’s greatest merrymaker.  The furniture was\nshrouded, the curtains drawn, the light shut away.",
        "While the carriage was waiting, Mrs. Clemens went back and took a last\nlook into each of the rooms, as if bidding a kind of good-by to the past.\nThen she entered the carriage, and Patrick McAleer, who had been with\nMark Twain and his wife since their wedding-day, drove them to the\nstation for the last time.",
        "Mark Twain had a contract for six newspaper letters at one thousand\ndollars each.  He was troubled with rheumatism in his arm, and wrote his\nfirst letter from Aix-les-Bains, a watering-place–a “health-factory,” as\nhe called it–and another from Marienbad.  They were in Germany in\nAugust, and one day came to Heidelberg, where they occupied their old\napartment of thirteen years before, room forty, in the Schloss Hotel,\nwith its far prospect of wood and hill, the winding Neckar, and the blue,\ndistant valley of the Rhine.  Then, presently, they came to Switzerland,\nto Ouchy-Lausanne, by lovely Lake Geneva, and here Clemens left the\nfamily and, with a guide and a boatman, went drifting down the Rhone in a\ncurious, flat-bottomed craft, thinking to find material for one or more\narticles, possibly for a book.  But drifting down that fair river through\nstill September days, past ancient, drowsy villages, among sloping\nvineyards, where grapes were ripening in the tranquil sunlight, was too\nrestful and soothing for work.  In a letter home, he wrote:",
        "“It’s too delicious, floating with the swift current under the awning\n     these superb, sunshiny days, in peace and quietness.  Some of the\n     curious old historical towns strangely persuade me, but it’s so\n     lovely afloat that I don’t stop, but view them from the outside and\n     sail on. . . I want to do all the rivers of Europe in an open boat\n     in summer weather.”",
        "One afternoon, about fifteen miles below the city of Valence, he made a\ndiscovery.  Dreamily observing the eastward horizon, he noticed that a\ndistant blue mountain presented a striking profile outline of Napoleon\nBonaparte.  It seemed really a great natural wonder, and he stopped that\nnight at the village just below, Beauchastel, a hoary huddle of houses\nwith the roofs all run together, and took a room at the little hotel,\nwith a window looking to the eastward, from which, next morning, he saw\nthe profile of the great stone face, wonderfully outlined against the\nsunrise.  He was excited over his discovery, and made a descriptive note\nof it and an outline sketch.  Then, drifting farther down the river, he\ncharacteristically forgot all about it and did not remember it again for\nten years, by which time he had forgotten the point on the river where\nthe Napoleon could be seen, forgotten even that he had made a note and\nsketch giving full details.  He wished the Napoleon to be found again,\nbelieving, as he declared, that it would become one of the natural\nwonders of the world.  To travelers going to France he attempted to\ndescribe it, and some of these tried to find it; but, as he located it\ntoo far down the Rhone, no one reported success, and in time he spoke of\nhis discovery as the “Lost Napoleon.”  It was not until after Mark\nTwain’s death that it was rediscovered, and then by the writer of this\nmemoir, who, having Mark Twain’s note-book,[11] with its exact memoranda,\non another September day, motoring up the Rhone, located the blue profile\nof the reclining Napoleon opposite the gray village of Beauchastel.  It\nis a really remarkable effigy, and deserves to be visited.",
        "Clemens finished his trip at Arles–a beautiful trip from beginning to\nend, but without literary result.  When he undertook to write of it, he\nfound that it lacked incident, and, what was worse, it lacked humor.  To\nundertake to create both was too much.  After a few chapters he put the\nmanuscript aside, unfinished, and so it remains to this day.",
        "The Clemens family spent the winter in Berlin, a gay winter, with Mark\nTwain as one of the distinguished figures of the German capital.  He was\nreceived everywhere and made much of.  Once a small, choice dinner was\ngiven him by Kaiser William II., and, later, a breakfast by the Empress.\nHis books were great favorites in the German royal family.  The Kaiser\nparticularly enjoyed the “Mississippi” book, while the essay on “The\nAwful German Language,” in the “Tramp Abroad,” he pronounced one of the\nfinest pieces of humor ever written.  Mark Twain’s books were favorites,\nin fact, throughout Germany.  The door-man in his hotel had them all in\nhis little room, and, discovering one day that their guest, Samuel L.\nClemens, and Mark Twain were one, he nearly exploded with excitement.\nDragging the author to his small room, he pointed to the shelf:",
        "“There,” he said, “you wrote them!  I’ve found it out.  Ach!  I did not\nknow it before, and I ask a million pardons.”",
        "Affairs were not going well in America, and in June Clemens made a trip\nover to see what could be done.  Probably he did very little, and he was\nback presently at Nauheim, a watering-place, where he was able to work\nrather quietly.  He began two stories–one of them, “The Extraordinary\nTwins,” which was the first form of “Pudd’nhead Wilson;” the other, “Tom\nSawyer Abroad,” for “St. Nicholas.”  Twichell came to Nauheim during the\nsummer, and one day he and Clemens ran over to Homburg, not far away.\nThe Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII.) was there, and Clemens and\nTwichell, walking in the park, met the Prince with the British\nambassador, and were presented.  Twichell, in an account of the meeting,\nsaid:",
        "“The meeting between the Prince and Mark was a most cordial one on\n     both sides, and presently the Prince took Mark Twain’s arm and the\n     two marched up and down, talking earnestly together, the Prince\n     solid, erect, and soldier-like; Clemens weaving along in his\n     curious, swinging gait, in full tide of talk, and brandishing a sun\n     umbrella of the most scandalous description.”",
        "At Villa Viviani, an old, old mansion outside of Florence, on the hill\ntoward Settignano, Mark Twain finished “Tom Sawyer Abroad,” also\n\"Pudd’nhead Wilson”, and wrote the first half of a book that really had\nits beginning on the day when, an apprentice-boy in Hannibal, he had\nfound a stray leaf from the pathetic story of “Joan of Arc.”  All his\nlife she had been his idol, and he had meant some day to write of her.\nNow, in this weather-stained old palace, looking down on Florence,\nmedieval and hazy, and across to the villa-dotted hills, he began one of\nthe most beautiful stories ever written, “The Personal Recollections of\nJoan of Arc.”  He wrote in the first person, assuming the character of\nJoan’s secretary, Sieur Louis de Conte, who in his old age is telling the\ngreat tale of the Maid of Orleans.  It was Mark Twain’s purpose, this\ntime, to publish anonymously.  Walking the floor one day at Viviani, and\nsmoking vigorously, he said to Mrs. Clemens and Susy:",
        "“I shall never be accepted seriously over my own signature.  People\n     always want to laugh over what I write, and are disappointed if they\n     don’t find a joke in it.  This is to be a serious book.  It means\n     more to me than anything else I have ever undertaken.  I shall write\n     it anonymously.”",
        "So it was that the gentle Sieur de Conte took up the pen, and the tale of\nJoan was begun in the ancient garden of Viviani, a setting appropriate to\nits lovely form.",
        "He wrote rapidly when once his plan was perfected and his material\narranged.  The reading of his youth and manhood was now recalled, not\nmerely as reading, but as remembered reality.  It was as if he were truly\nthe old Sieur de Conte, saturated with memories, pouring out the tender,\ntragic tale.  In six weeks he had written one hundred thousand words–\nremarkable progress at any time, the more so when we consider that some\nof the authorities he consulted were in a foreign tongue.  He had always\nmore or less kept up his study of French, begun so long ago on the river,\nand it stood him now in good stead.  Still, it was never easy for him,\nand the multitude of notes that still exist along the margin of his\nFrench authorities show the magnitude of his work.  Others of the family\nwent down into the city almost daily, but he stayed in the still garden\nwith Joan.  Florence and its suburbs were full of delightful people, some\nof them old friends.  There were luncheons, dinners, teas, dances, and\nthe like always in progress, but he resisted most of these things,\npreferring to remain the quaint old Sieur de Conte, following again the\nbanner of the Maid of Orleans marshaling her twilight armies across his\nillumined page.",
        "But the next spring, March, 1893, he was obliged to put aside the\nmanuscript and hurry to America again, fruitlessly, of course, for a\nfinancial stress was on the land; the business of Webster & Co. was on\nthe down-grade–nothing could save it.  There was new hope in the old\ntype-setting machine, but his faith in the resurrection was not strong.\nThe strain of his affairs was telling on him.  The business owed a great\nsum, with no prospect of relief.  Back in Europe again, Mark Twain wrote\nF. D. Hall, his business manager in New York:",
        "“I am terribly tired of business.  I am by nature and disposition\n     unfit for it, and I want to get out of it.  I am standing on a\n     volcano.  Get me out of business.”",
        "Tantalizing letters continued to come, holding out hope in the business–\nthe machine–in any straw that promised a little support through the\nfinancial storm.  Again he wrote Hall:",
        "“Great Scott, but it’s a long year for you and me!  I never knew the\n     almanac to drag so.  .  .  I watch for your letters hungrily–just\n     as I used to watch for the telegram saying the machine was finished\n     –but when “next week certainly” suddenly swelled into “three weeks\n     sure,” I recognized the old familiar tune I used to hear so much.\n     W. don’t know what sick-heartedness is, but he is in a fair way to\n     find out.”",
        "They closed Viviani in June and returned to Germany.  By the end of\nAugust Clemens could stand no longer the strain of his American affairs,\nand, leaving the family at some German baths, he once more sailed for New\nYork.",
        "[11] At Mark Twain’s death his various literary effects passed into the\nhands of his biographer and literary executor, the present writer.",
        "In a room at the Players Club–\"a cheap room,” he wrote home, “at $1.5o\nper day\"–Mark Twain spent the winter, hoping against hope to weather the\nfinancial storm.  His fortunes were at a lower ebb than ever before;\nlower even than during those bleak mining days among the Esmeralda hills.\nThen there had been no one but himself, and he was young.  Now, at fifty-\neight, he had precious lives dependent upon him, and he was weighed down\nby debt.  The liabilities of his firm were fully two hundred thousand\ndollars–sixty thousand of which were owing to Mrs. Clemens for money\nadvanced–but the large remaining sum was due to banks, printers,\nbinders, and the manufacturers of paper.  A panic was on the land and\nthere was no business.  What he was to do Clemens did not know.  He spent\nmost of his days in his room, trying to write, and succeeded in finishing\nseveral magazine articles.  Outwardly cheerful, he hid the bitterness of\nhis situation.",
        "A few, however, knew the true state of his affairs.  One of these one\nnight introduced him to Henry H. Rogers, the Standard Oil millionaire.",
        "“Mr. Clemens,” said Mr. Rogers, “I was one of your early admirers.  I\nheard you lecture a long time ago, on the Sandwich Islands.”",
        "They sat down at a table, and Mark Twain told amusing stories.  Rogers\nwas in a perpetual gale of laughter.  They became friends from that\nevening, and in due time the author had confessed to the financier all\nhis business worries.",
        "“You had better let me look into things a little,” Rogers said, and he\nadvised Clemens to “stop walking the floor.”",
        "It was characteristic of Mark Twain to be willing to unload his affairs\nupon any one that he thought able to bear the burden.  He became a new\nman overnight.  With Henry Rogers in charge, life was once more worth\nwhile.  He accepted invitations from the Rogers family and from many\nothers, and was presently so gay, so widely sought, and seen in so many\nplaces that one of his acquaintances, “Jamie” Dodge, dubbed him the\n\"Belle of New York.”",
        "Henry Rogers, meanwhile, was “looking into things.”  He had reasonable\nfaith in the type-machine, and advanced a large sum on the chance of its\nproving a success.  This, of course, lifted Mark Twain quite into the\nclouds.  Daily he wrote and cabled all sorts of glowing hopes to his\nfamily, then in Paris.  Once he wrote:",
        "“The ship is in sight now ....  When the anchor is down, then I shall\n     say: Farewell–a long farewell–to business!  I will never touch it\n     again!  I will live in literature, I will wallow in it, revel in it;\n     I will swim in ink!”",
        "Once he cabled, “Expect good news in ten days\"; and a little later, “Look\nout for good news\"; and in a few days, “Nearing success.”",
        "Those Sellers-like messages could not but appeal, Mrs. Clemens’s sense of\nhumor, even in those dark days.  To her sister she wrote, “They make me\nlaugh, for they are so like my beloved Colonel.”",
        "The affairs of Webster & Co. Mr. Rogers found a bad way.  When, at last,\nin April, 1894, the crisis came–a demand by the chief creditors for\npayment–he advised immediate assignment as the only course.",
        "So the firm of Webster & Co. closed its doors.  The business which less\nthan ten years before had begun so prosperously had ended in failure.\nMark Twain, nearing fifty-nine, was bankrupt.  When all the firm’s\neffects had been sold and applied on the counts, he was still more than\nseventy thousand dollars in debt.  Friends stepped in and offered to lend\nhim money, but he declined these offers.  Through Mr. Rogers a basis of\nsettlement at fifty cents on the dollar was arranged, and Mark Twain\nsaid, “Give me time, and I will pay the other fifty.”",
        "No one but his wife and Mr. Rogers, however, believed that at his age he\nwould be able to make good the promise.  Many advised him not to attempt\nit, but to settle once and for all on the legal basis as arranged.\nSometimes, in moments of despondency, he almost surrendered.  Once he\nsaid:",
        "“I need not dream of paying it.  I never could manage it.”",
        "But these were only the hard moments.  For the most part he kept up good\nheart and confidence.  It is true that he now believed again in the\nfuture of the type-setter, and that returns from it would pay him out of\nbankruptcy.  But later in the year this final hope was taken away.  Mr.\nRogers wrote to him that in the final test the machine had failed to\nprove itself practical and that the whole project had been finally and\npermanently abandoned.  The shock of disappointment was heavy for the\nmoment, but then it was over–completely over–for that old mechanical\ndemon, that vampire of invention that had sapped his fortune so long, was\nlaid at last.  The worst had happened; there was nothing more to dread.\nWithin a week Mark Twain (he was now back in Paris with the family) had\nsettled down to work once more on the “Recollections of Joan,” and all\nmention and memory of the type-setter was forever put away.  The machine\nstands to-day in the Sibley College of Engineering, where it is exhibited\nas the costliest piece of mechanism for its size ever constructed.  Mark\nTwain once received a letter from an author who had written a book to\nassist inventors and patentees, asking for his indorsement.  He replied:",
        "“DEAR SIR,–I have, as you say, been interested in patents and\n     patentees.  If your book tells how to exterminate inventors, send me\n     nine editions.  Send them by express.",
        "“Very truly yours,",
        "“S. L. CLEMENS.”",
        "Those were economical days.  There was no income except from the old\nbooks, and at the time this was not large.  The Clemens family, however,\nwas cheerful, and Mark Twain was once more in splendid working form.  The\nstory of Joan hurried to its tragic conclusion.  Each night he read to\nthe family what he had written that day, and Susy, who was easily moved,\nwould say, “Wait–wait till I get my handkerchief,” and one night when\nthe last pages had been written and read, and the fearful scene at Rouen\nhad been depicted, Susy wrote in her diary, “To-night Joan of Arc was\nburned at the stake!”  Meaning that the book was finished.",
        "Susy herself had fine literary taste, and might have written had not her\ngreater purpose been to sing.  There are fragments of her writing that\nshow the true literary touch.  Both Susy and her father cared more for\nJoan than for any of the former books.  To Mr. Rogers Clemens wrote,\n\"Possibly the book may not sell, but that is nothing–it was mitten for\nlove.”  It was placed serially with “Harper’s Magazine” and appeared\nanonymously, but the public soon identified the inimitable touch of Mark\nTwain.",
        "It was now the spring of 1895, and Mark Twain had decided upon a new plan\nto restore his fortunes.  Platform work had always paid him well, and\nthough he disliked it now more than ever, he had resolved upon something\nunheard of in that line–nothing less, in fact, than a platform tour\naround the world.  In May, with the family, he sailed for America, and\nafter a month or two of rest at Quarry Farm he set out with Mrs. Clemens\nand Clara and with his American agent, J. B. Pond, for the Pacific coast.\nSusy and Jean remained behind with their aunt at the farm.  The travelers\nleft Elmira at night, and they always remembered the picture of Susy,\nstanding under the electric light of the railway platform, waving them\ngood-by.",
        "Mark Twain’s tour of the world was a success from the beginning.\nEverywhere he was received with splendid honors–in America, in\nAustralia, in New Zealand, in India, in Ceylon, in South Africa–wherever\nhe went his welcome was a grand ovation, his theaters and halls were\nnever large enough to hold his audiences.  With the possible exception of\nGeneral Grant’s long tour in 1878-9 there had hardly been a more gorgeous\nprogress than Mark Twain’s trip around the world.  Everywhere they were\noverwhelmed with attention and gifts.  We cannot begin to tell the story\nof that journey here.  In “Following the Equator” the author himself\ntells it in his own delightful fashion.",
        "From time to time along the way Mark Twain forwarded his accumulated\nprofits to Mr. Rogers to apply against his debts, and by the time they\nsailed from South Africa the sum was large enough to encourage him to\nbelieve that, with the royalties to be derived from the book he would\nwrite of his travels, he might be able to pay in full and so face the\nworld once more a free man.  Their long trip–it had lasted a full year–\nwas nearing its end.  They would spend the winter in London–Susy and\nJean were notified to join them there.  They would all be reunited again.\nThe outlook seemed bright once more.",
        "They reached England the last of July.  Susy and Jean, with Katy Leary,\nwere to arrive on the 12th of August.  But the 12th did not bring them–\nit brought, instead, a letter.  Susy was not well, the letter said; the\nsailing had been postponed.  The letter added that it was nothing\nserious, but her parents cabled at once for later news.  Receiving no\nsatisfactory answer, Mrs. Clemens, full of forebodings, prepared to sail\nwith Clara for America.  Clemens would remain in London to arrange for\nthe winter residence.  A cable came, saying Susy’s recovery would be slow\nbut certain.  Mrs. Clemens and Clara sailed immediately.  In some notes\nhe once dictated, Mark Twain said:",
        "“That was the 15th of August, 1896.  Three days later, when my wife\n     and Clara were about half-way across the ocean, I was standing in\n     our dining-room, thinking of nothing in particular, when a cablegram\n     was put into my hand.  It said, ’Susy was peacefully released to-\n     day.’”",
        "Mark Twain’s life had contained other tragedies, but no other that\nequaled this one.  The dead girl had been his heart’s pride; it was a\nyear since they parted, and now he knew he would never see her again.\nThe blow had found him alone and among strangers.  In that day he could\nnot even reach out to those upon the ocean, drawing daily nearer to the\nheartbreak.",
        "Susy Clemens had died in the old Hartford home.  She had been well far a\ntime at the farm, but then her health had declined.  She worked\ncontinuously at her singing lessons and over-tried her strength.  Then\nshe went on a visit to Mrs. Charles Dudley Warner, in Hartford; but she\ndid not rest, working harder than ever at her singing.  Finally she was\ntold that she must consult a physician.  The doctor came and prescribed\nsoothing remedies, and advised that she have the rest and quiet of her\nown home.  Mrs. Crane came from Elmira, also her uncle Charles Langdon.\nBut Susy became worse, and a few days later her malady was pronounced\nmeningitis.  This was the 15th of August, the day that her mother and\nClara sailed from England.  She was delirious and burning with fever, but\nat last sank into unconsciousness.  She died three days later, and on the\nnight that Mrs. Clemens and Clara arrived was taken to Elmira for burial.",
        "They laid her beside the little brother that had died so long before, and\nordered a headstone with some lines which they had found in Australia,\nwritten by Robert Richardson:",
        "Warm summer sun, shine kindly here;\n               Warm southern wind, blow softly here;\n               Green sod above, lie light, lie light!–\n               Good night, dear heart, good night, good night.",
        "With Clara and Jean, Mrs. Clemens returned to England, and in a modest\nhouse on Tedworth Square, a secluded corner of London, the stricken\nfamily hid themselves away for the winter. Few, even of their closest\nfriends, knew of their whereabouts.  In time the report was circulated\nthat Mask Twain, old, sick, and deserted by his family, was living in\npoverty, toiling to pay his debts.  Through the London publishers a\ndistant cousin, Dr. James Clemens, of St. Louis, located the house on\nTedworth Square, and wrote, offering assistance.  He was invited to call,\nand found a quiet place–the life there simple–but not poverty.  By and\nby there was another report–this time that Mark Twain was dead.  A\nreporter found his way to Tedworth Square, and, being received by Mark\nTwain himself, asked what he should say.",
        "Clemens regarded him gravely, then, in his slow, nasal drawl, “Say–that\nthe report of my death–has been grossly–exaggerated, “a remark that a\nday later was amusing both hemispheres.  He could not help his humor; it\nwas his natural form of utterance–the medium for conveying fact,\nfiction, satire, philosophy.  Whatever his depth of despair, the quaint\nsurprise of speech would come, and it would be so until his last day.",
        "By November he was at work on his book of travel, which he first thought\nof calling “Around the World.”  He went out not at all that winter, and\nthe work progressed steadily, and was complete by the following May\n(1897).",
        "Meantime, during his trip around the world, Mark Twain’s publishers had\nissued two volumes of his work–the “Joan of Arc” book, and another “Tom\nSawyer” book, the latter volume combining two rather short stories, “Tom\nSawyer Abroad,” published serially in St. Nicholas, and “Tom Sawyer,\nDetective.”  The “Joan of Arc” book, the tenderest and most exquisite of\nall Mark Twain’s work–a tale told with the deepest sympathy and the\nrarest delicacy–was dedicated by the author to his wife, as being the\nonly piece of his writing which he considered worthy of this honor.  He\nregarded it as his best book, and this was an opinion that did not\nchange.  Twelve years later–it was on his seventy-third birthday–he\nwrote as his final verdict, November 30, 1908:",
        "“I like the Joan of Arc best of all my books; and it is the best; I\n     know it perfectly well, and, besides, it furnished me seven times\n     the pleasure afforded me by any of the others; twelve years of\n     preparation and two years of writing.  The others needed no\n     preparation and got none.\n                                                  MARK TWAIN.”",
        "The public at first did not agree with the author’s estimate, and the\ndemand for the book was not large.  But the public amended its opinion.\nThe demand for “Joan” increased with each year until its sales ranked\nwith the most popular of Mark Twain’s books.",
        "The new stories of Tom and Huck have never been as popular as the earlier\nadventures of this pair of heroes.  The shorter stories are less\nimportant and perhaps less alive, but they are certainly very readable\ntales, and nobody but Mark Twain could have written them.",
        "Clemens began some new stories when his travel book was out of the way,\nbut presently with the family was on the way to Switzerland for the\nsummer.  They lived at Weggis, on Lake Lucerne, in the Villa Buhlegg–a\nvery modest five-franc-a-day pension, for they were economizing and\nputting away money for the debts.  Mark Twain was not in a mood for work,\nand, besides, proofs of the new book “Following the Equator,” as it is\nnow called–were coming steadily.  But on the anniversary of Susy’s death\n(August 18th) he wrote a poem, “In Memoriam,” in which he touched a\nliterary height never before attained.  It was published in “Harper’s\nMagazine,” and now appears in his collected works.",
        "Across from Villa Buhlegg on the lake-front there was a small shaded\ninclosure where he loved to sit and look out on the blue water and lofty\nmountains, one of which, Rigi, he and Twichell had climbed nineteen years\nbefore.  The little retreat is still there, and to-day one of the trees\nbears a tablet (in German), “Mark Twain’s Rest.”",
        "Autumn found the family in Vienna, located for the winter at the Hotel\nMetropole.  Mrs. Clemens realized that her daughters must no longer be\ndeprived of social and artistic advantages.  For herself, she longed only\nfor retirement.",
        "Vienna is always a gay city, a center of art and culture and splendid\nsocial functions.  From the moment of his arrival, Mark Twain and his\nfamily were in the midst of affairs.  Their room at the Metropole became\nan assembling-place for distinguished members of the several circles that\ngo to make up the dazzling Viennese life.  Mrs. Clemens, to her sister in\nAmerica, once wrote:",
        "“Such funny combinations are here sometimes: one duke, several\n     counts, several writers, several barons, two princes, newspaper\n     women, etc.”",
        "Mark Twain found himself the literary lion of the Austrian capital.\nEvery club entertained him and roared with delight at his German\nspeeches.  Wherever he appeared on the streets he was recognized.",
        "“Let him pass!  Don’t you see it is Herr Mark Twain!” commanded an\nofficer to a guard who, in the midst of a great assemblage, had presumed\nto bar the way.",
        "Mark Twain wrote much and well during this period, in spite of his social\nlife.  His article “Concerning the Jews” was written that first winter in\nVienna–a fine piece of special pleading; also the greatest of his short\nstories–one of the greatest of all short stories–\"The Man that\nCorrupted Hadleyburg.”",
        "But there were good reasons why he should write better now; his mind was\nfree of a mighty load–he had paid his debts!",
        "Soon after his arrival in Vienna he had written to Mr. Rogers:",
        "“Let us begin on those debts.  I cannot bear the weight any longer.\n     It totally unfits me for work.”",
        "He had accumulated a large sum for the purpose, and the royalties from\nthe new book were beginning to roll in.  Payment of the debts was begun.\nAt the end of December he wrote again:",
        "“Land, we are glad to see those debts diminishing.  For the first\n     time in my life I am getting more pleasure from paying money out\n     than from pulling it in.”",
        "A few days later he wrote to Howells that he had “turned the corner\"; and\nagain:",
        "“We’ve lived close to the bone and saved every cent we could, and\n     there’s no undisputed claim now that we can’t cash .  .  .  .  I\n     hope you will never get the like of the load saddled on to you that\n     was saddled on to me, three years ago.  And yet there is such a\n     solid pleasure in paying the things that I reckon it is worth while\n     to get into that kind of a hobble, after all.  Mrs. Clemens gets\n     millions of delight out of it, and the children have never uttered\n     one complaint about the scrimping from the beginning.”",
        "By the end of January, 1898, Clemens had accumulated enough money to make\nthe final payments to his creditors.  At the time of his failure he had\ngiven himself five years to achieve this result.  But he had needed less\nthan four.  A report from Mr. Rogers showed that a balance of thirteen\nthousand dollars would remain to his credit after the last accounts were\nwiped away.",
        "Clemens had tried to keep his money affairs out of the newspapers, but\nthe payment of the final claims could not be concealed, and the press\nmade the most of it.  Head-lines shouted it.  Editorials heralded Mark\nTwain as a second Walter Scott, because Scott, too, had labored to lift a\ngreat burden of debt.  Never had Mark Twain been so beloved by his\nfellow-men.",
        "One might suppose now that he had had enough of invention and commercial\nenterprises of every sort–that is, one who did not know Mark Twain might\nsuppose this–but it would not be true.  Within a month after his debts\nwere paid he was negotiating with the Austrian inventor Szczepanik for\nthe American rights in a wonderful carpet-pattern machine, and, Sellers-\nlike, was planning to organize a company with a capital of fifteen\nhundred million dollars to control the carpet-weaving industries of the\nworld.  He wrote to Mr. Rogers about the great scheme, inviting the\nStandard Oil to “come in\"; but the plan failed to bear the test of Mr.\nRogers’s investigation and was heard of no more.",
        "Samuel Clemens’s obligation to Henry Rogers was very great, but it was\nnot quite the obligation that many supposed it to be.  It was often\nasserted that the financier lent, even gave, the humorist large sums, and\npointed out opportunities for speculation.  No part of this statement is\ntrue.  Mr. Rogers neither lent nor gave Mark Twain money, and never\nallowed him to speculate when he could prevent it.  He sometimes invested\nMark Twain’s own funds for him, but he never bought for him a share of\nstock without money in hand to pay for it in full–money belonging to,\nand earned by, Clemens himself.",
        "What Henry Rogers did give to Mark Twain was his priceless counsel and\ntime–gifts more precious than any mere sum of money–favors that Mark\nTwain could accept without humiliation.  He did accept them, and never\nceased to be grateful.  He rarely wrote without expressing his gratitude,\nand we get the size of Mark Twain’s obligation when in one letter we\nread:",
        "“I have abundant peace of mind again–no sense of burden.  Work is\n     become a pleasure–it is not labor any longer.”",
        "He wrote much and well, mainly magazine articles, including some of those\nchapters later gathered it his book on “Christian Science.”  He reveled\nlike a boy in his new freedom and fortunes, in the lavish honors paid\nhim, in the rich circumstance of Viennese life.  But always just beneath\nthe surface were unforgetable sorrows.  His face in repose was always\nsad.  Once, after writing to Howells of his successes, he added:",
        "“All those things might move and interest one.  But how desperately\n     more I have been moved to-night by the thought of a little old copy\n     in the nursery of “At the Back of the North Wind.”  Oh, what happy\n     days they were when that book was read, and how Susy loved it!”",
        "News came to Vienna of the death of Orion Clemens, at the age of seventy-\ntwo.  Orion had died as he had lived–a gentle dreamer, always with a new\nplan.  He had not been sick at all.  One morning early he had seated\nhimself at a table, with pencil and paper, and was putting down the\ndetails of his latest project, when death came–kindly, in the moment of\nnew hope.  He was a generous, upright man, beloved by all who understood\nhim.",
        "The Clemenses remained two winters in Vienna, spending the second at the\nHotel Krantz, where their rooms were larger and finer than at the\nMetropole, and even more crowded with notabilities.  Their salon acquired\nthe name of the “Second Embassy,” and Mark Twain was, in fact, the most\nrepresentative American in the Austrian capital.  It became the fashion\nto consult him on every question of public interest, his comments,\nwhether serious or otherwise, being always worth printing.  When European\ndisarmament was proposed, Editor William T. Stead, of the “Review of\nReviews,” wrote for his opinion.  He replied:",
        "“DEAR Mr. STEAD,–The Tsar is ready to disarm.  I am\n          ready to disarm.  Collect the others; it should not be\n          much of a task now.                      MARK TWAIN.”",
        "He refused offers of many sorts.  He declined ten thousand dollars for a\ntobacco endorsement, though he liked the tobacco well enough.  He\ndeclined ten thousand dollars a year for five years to lend his name as\neditor of a humorous periodical.  He declined another ten thousand for\nten lectures, and another offer for fifty lectures at the same rates–\nthat is, one thousand dollars per night.  He could get along without\nthese sums, he said, and still preserve some remnants of his self-\nrespect.",
        "It was May, 1899, when Clemens and his family left Vienna.  They spent a\nsummer in Sweden on account of the health of Jean Clemens, and located\nin London apartments–30 Wellington Court–for the winter.  Then followed\na summer at beautiful Dollis Hill, an old house where Gladstone had often\nvisited, on a shady hilltop just outside of London.  The city had not\nquite enclosed the place then, and there were spreading oaks, a pond with\nlily-pads, and wide spaces of grassy lawn.  The place to-day is converted\ninto a public garden called Gladstone Park.  Writing to Twichell in mid-\nsummer, Clemens said:",
        "“I am the only person who is ever in the house in the daytime, but I\n     am working, and deep in the luxury of it.  But there is one\n     tremendous defect.  Levy is all so enchanted with the place and so\n     in love with it that she doesn’t know how she is going to tear\n     herself away from it.”",
        "However, there was one still greater attraction than Dollis Hill, and\nthat was America–home.  Mark Twain at sixty-five and a free man once\nmore had decided to return to his native land.  They closed Dollis Hill\nat the end of September, and October 6, 1900, sailed on the Minnehaha for\nNew York, bidding good-by, as Mark Twain believed, and hoped, to foreign\ntravel.  Nine days later, to a reporter who greeted him on the ship, he\nsaid:",
        "“If I ever get ashore I am going to break both of my legs so I can’t\n     get away again.”",
        "New York tried to outdo Vienna and London in honoring Mark Twain.  Every\nnewspaper was filled with the story of his great fight against debt, and\nhis triumph.  “He had behaved like Walter Scott,” writes Howells, “as\nmillions rejoiced to know who had not known how Walter Scott behaved till\nthey knew it was like Clemens.”  Clubs and societies vied with one\nanother in offering him grand entertainments.  Literary and lecture\nproposals poured in.  He was offered at the rate of a dollar a word for\nhis writing–he could name his own terms for lectures.",
        "These sensational offers did not tempt him.  He was sick of the platform.\nHe made a dinner speech here and there–always an event–but he gave no\nlectures or readings for profit.  His literary work he confined to a few\nmagazines, and presently concluded an arrangement with “Harper &\nBrothers” for whatever he might write, the payment to be twenty (later\nthirty) cents per word.  He arranged with the same firm for the\npublication of all his books, by this time collected in uniform edition.\nHe wished his affairs to be settled as nearly as might be.  His desire\nwas freedom from care.  Also he would have liked a period of quiet and\nrest, but that was impossible.  He realized that the multitude of honors\ntendered him was in a sense a vast compliment which he could not entirely\nrefuse.  Howells writes that Mark Twain’s countrymen “kept it up past all\nprecedent,” and in return Mark Twain tried to do his part.  “His friends\nsaw that he was wearing himself out,” adds Howells, and certain it is\nthat he grew thin and pale and had a hacking cough.  Once to Richard\nWatson Gilder he wrote:",
        "“In bed with a chest cold and other company.",
        "“DEAR GILDER,–I can’t.  If I were a well man I could explain\n          with this pencil, but in the cir–ces I will leave it all to\n          your imagination.",
        "“Was it Grady that killed himself trying to do all the dining\n          and speeching?  No, old man, no, no!",
        "“Ever yours, MARK.”",
        "In the various dinner speeches and other utterances made by Mark Twain at\nthis time, his hearers recognized a new and great seriousness of purpose.\nIt was not really new, only, perhaps, more emphasized.  He still made\nthem laugh, but he insisted on making them think, too.  He preached a new\ngospel of patriotism–not the patriotism that means a boisterous cheering\nof the Stars and Stripes wherever unfurled, but the patriotism that\nproposes to keep the Stars and Stripes clean and worth shouting for.  In\none place he said:",
        "“We teach the boys to atrophy their independence.  We teach them to\n     take their patriotism at second hand; to shout with the largest\n     crowd without examining into the right or wrong of the matter–\n     exactly as boys under monarchies are taught, and have always been\n     taught.”",
        "He protested against the blind allegiance of monarchies.  He was seldom\n\"with the largest crowd” himself.  Writing much of our foreign affairs,\nthen in a good deal of a muddle, he assailed so fearlessly and fiercely\nmeasures which he held to be unjust that he was caricatured as an armed\nknight on a charger and as Huck Finn with a gun.",
        "But he was not always warlike.  One of the speeches he made that winter\nwas with Col. Henry Watterson, a former Confederate soldier, at a Lincoln\nbirthday memorial at Carnegie Hall.  “Think of it!” he wrote Twichell,\n\"two old rebels functioning there; I as president and Watterson as orator\nof the day.  Things have changed somewhat in these forty years, thank\nGod!”",
        "The Clemens household did not go back to Hartford.  During their early\nyears abroad it had been Mrs. Clemens’s dream to return and open the\nbeautiful home, with everything the same as before.  The death of Susy\nhad changed all this.  The mother had grown more and more to feel that\nshe could not bear the sorrow of Susy’s absence in the familiar rooms.\nAfter a trip which Clemens himself made to Hartford, he wrote, “I realize\nthat if we ever enter the house again to live, our hearts will break.”",
        "So they did not go back.  Mrs. Clemens had seen it for the last time on\nthat day when the carnage waited while she went back to take a last look\ninto the vacant rooms.  They had taken a house at 14 West Tenth Street\nfor the winter, and when summer came they went to a log cabin on Saranac\nLake, which they called “The Lair.”  Here Mark Twain wrote “A Double-\nbarreled Detective Story,” a not very successful burlesque of Sherlock\nHolmes.  But most of the time that summer he loafed and rested, as was\nhis right.  Once during the summer he went on a cruise with H. H. Rogers,\nSpeaker “Tom” Reed, and others on Mr. Rogers’s yacht.",
        "The family did not return to New York.  They took a beautiful house at\nRiverdale on the Hudson–the old Appleton homestead.  Here they\nestablished themselves and settled down for American residence.  They\nwould have bought the Appleton place, but the price was beyond their\nreach.",
        "It was in the autumn of 1901 that Mark Twain settled in Riverdale.  In\nJune of the following year he was summoned West to receive the degree of\nLL.D.  from the university of his native state.  He made the journey a\nsort of last general visit to old associations and friends.  In St. Louis\nhe saw Horace Bixby, fresh, wiry, and capable as he had been forty-five\nyears before.  Clemens said:",
        "“I have become an old man.  You are still thirty-five.”",
        "They went over to the rooms of the pilots’ association, where the river-\nmen gathered in force to celebrate his return.  Then he took train for\nHannibal.",
        "He spent several days in Hannibal and saw Laura Hawkins–Mrs. Frazer, and\na widow now–and John Briggs, an old man, and John RoBards, who had worn\nthe golden curls and the medal for good conduct.  They drove him to the\nold house on Hill Street, where once he had lived and set type;\nphotographers were there and photographed him standing at the front door.",
        "“It all seems so small to me,” he said, as he looked through the house.\n\"A boy’s home is a big place to him.  I suppose if I should come back\nagain ten years from now it would be the size of a bird-house.”  He did\nnot see “Huck\"–Torn Blankenship had not lived in Hannibal for many\nyears.  But he was driven to all the familiar haunts–to Lover’s Leap,\nthe cave, and the rest; and Sunday afternoon, with John Briggs, he walked\nover Holliday’s Hill–the “Cardiff Hill” of “Tom Sawyer.”  It was just\nsuch a day, as the one when they had damaged a cooper shop and so nearly\nfinished the old negro driver.  A good deal more than fifty years had\npassed since then, and now here they were once more–Tom Sawyer and Joe\nHarper–two old men, the hills still fresh and green, the river rippling\nin the sun.  Looking across to the Illinois shore and the green islands\nwhere they had played, and to Lover’s Leap on the south, the man who had\nbeen Sam Clemens said:",
        "“John, that is one of the loveliest sights I ever saw.  Down there is the\nplace we used to swim, and yonder is where a man was drowned, and there’s\nwhere the steamboat sank.  Down there on Lover’s Leap is where the\nMillerites put on their robes one night to go to heaven.  None of them\nwent that night, but I suppose most of them have gone now.”",
        "John Briggs said, “Sam, do you remember the day we stole peaches from old\nman Price, and one of his bow-legged niggers came after us with dogs, and\nhow we made up our minds we’d catch that nigger and drown him?”",
        "And so they talked on of this thing and that, and by and by drove along\nthe river, and Sam Clemens pointed out the place where he swam it and was\ntaken with a cramp on the return.",
        "“Once near the shore I thought I would let down,” he said, “but was\nafraid to, knowing that if the water was deep I was a goner, but finally\nmy knee struck the sand and I crawled out.  That was the closest call I\never had.”",
        "They drove by a place where a haunted house had stood.  They drank from a\nwell they had always known–from the bucket, as they had always drunk–\ntalking, always talking, touching with lingering fondness that most\nbeautiful and safest of all our possessions–the past.",
        "“Sam,” said John, when they parted, “this is probably the last time we\nshall meet on earth.  God bless you.  Perhaps somewhere we shall renew\nour friendship.”",
        "“John,” was the answer, “this day has been worth a thousand dollars to\nme.  We were like brothers once, and I feel that we are the same now.\nGood-by, John.  I’ll try to meet you somewhere.”",
        "Clemens left next day for Columbia, where the university is located.  At\neach station a crowd had gathered to cheer and wave as the train pulled\nin and to offer him flowers.  Sometimes he tried to say a few words, but\nhis voice would not come.  This was more than even Tom Sawyer had\ndreamed.",
        "Certainly there is something deeply touching in the recognition of one’s\nnative State; the return of the boy who has set out unknown to battle\nwith life and who is called back to be crowned is unlike any other home-\ncoming–more dramatic, more moving.  Next day at the university Mark\nTwain, summoned before the crowded assembly-hall to receive his degree,\nstepped out to the center of the stage and paused.  He seemed in doubt as\nto whether he should make a speech or only express his thanks for the\nhonor received.  Suddenly and without signal the great audience rose and\nstood in silence at his feet.  He bowed but he could not speak.  Then the\nvast assembly began a peculiar chant, spelling out slowly the word M-i-s-\ns-o-u-r-i, with a pause between each letter.  It was tremendously\nimpressive.",
        "Mark Twain was not left in doubt as to what was required of him when the\nchant ended.  The audience demanded a speech–a speech, and he made them\none–such a speech as no one there would forget to his dying day.",
        "Back in St. Louis, he attended the rechristening of the St. Louis harbor\nboat; it had been previously called the “St. Louis,” but it was now to be\ncalled the “Mark Twain.”",
        "Life which had begun very cheerfully at Riverdale ended sadly enough.  In\nAugust, at York Harbor, Maine, Mrs. Clemens’s health failed and she was\nbrought home an invalid, confined almost entirely to her room.  She had\nbeen always the life, the center, the mainspring of the household.  Now\nshe must not even be consulted–hardly visited.  On her bad days–and\nthey were many–Clemens, sad and anxious, spent most of his time\nlingering about her door, waiting for news, or until he was permitted to\nsee her for a brief moment.  In his memorandum-book of that period he\nwrote:",
        "“Our dear prisoner is where she is through overwork–day and night\n     devotion to the children and me.  We did not know how to value it.\n     We know now.”",
        "And on the margin of a letter praising him for what he had done for the\nworld’s enjoyment, and for his triumph over debt, he wrote:",
        "“Livy never gets her share of those applauses, but it is because the\n     people do not know.  Yet she is entitled to the lion’s share.”",
        "She improved during the winter, but very slowly.  Her husband wrote in\nhis diary:",
        "“Feb. 2, 1903–Thirty-third wedding anniversary.  I was allowed to\n     see Livy five minutes this morning, in honor of the day.”",
        "Mrs. Clemens had always remembered affectionately their winter in\nFlorence of ten years before, and she now expressed the feeling that if\nshe were in Florence again she would be better.  The doctors approved,\nand it was decided that she should be taken there as soon as she was\nstrong enough to travel.  She had so far improved by June that they\njourneyed to Elmira, where in the quiet rest of Quarry Farm her strength\nreturned somewhat and the hope of her recovery was strong.",
        "Mark Twain wrote a story that summer in Elmira, in the little octagonal\nstudy, shut in now by trees and overgrown with vines.  “A Dog’s Tale,” a\npathetic plea against vivisection, was the last story written in the\nlittle retreat that had seen the beginning of “Tom Sawyer” twenty-nine\nyears before.",
        "There was a feeling that the stay in Europe was this time to be\npermanent.  On one of the first days of October Clemens wrote in his\nnote-book:",
        "“To-day I place flowers on Susy’s grave–for the last time, probably\n     –and read the words, ’Good night, dear heart, good night,\n     good night.’”",
        "They sailed on the 24th, by way of Naples and Genoa, and were presently\ninstalled in the Villa Reale di Quarto, a fine old Italian palace, in an\nancient garden looking out over Florence toward Vallombrosa and the\nChianti hills.  It was a beautiful spot, though its aging walls and\ncypresses and matted vines gave it a rather mournful look.  Mrs.\nClemens’s health improved there for a time, in spite of dull, rainy,\ndepressing weather; so much so that in May, when the warmth and sun came\nback, Clemens was driving about the country, seeking a villa that he\nmight buy for a home.",
        "On one of these days–it was a Sunday in early June, the 5th–when he had\nbeen out with Jean, and had found a villa which he believed would fill\nall their requirements, he came home full of enthusiasm and hope, eager\nto tell the patient about the discovery.  Certainly she seemed better.  A\nday or two before she had been wheeled out on the terrace to enjoy the\nwonder of early Italian summer.",
        "He found her bright and cheerful, anxious to hear all their plans for the\nnew home.  He stayed with her alone through the dinner hour, and their\ntalk was as in the old days.  Summoned to go at last, he chided himself\nfor staying so long; but she said there was no harm and kissed him,\nsaying, “you will come back?” and he answered “Yes, to say good night,\"\nmeaning at half-past nine, as was the permitted custom.  He stood a\nmoment at the door, throwing kisses to her, and she returned them, her\nface bright with smiles.",
        "He was so full of hope–they were going to be happy again.  Long ago he\nhad been in the habit of singing jubilee songs to the children.  He went\nupstairs now to the piano and played the chorus and sang “Swing Low,\nSweet Chariot,” and “My Lord He Calls Me.”  He stopped then, but Jean,\nwho had come in, asked him to go on.  Mrs. Clemens, from her room, heard\nthe music and said to Katy Leary:",
        "“He is singing a good-night carol to me.”",
        "The music ceased presently.  A moment later she asked to be lifted up.\nAlmost in that instant life slipped away without a sound.",
        "Clemens, just then coming to say good-night, saw a little group gathered\nabout her bed, and heard Clara ask:",
        "“Katy, is it true?  Oh, Katy, is it true?”",
        "In his note-book that night he wrote:",
        "“At a quarter-past nine this evening she that was the life of my life\n     passed to the relief and the peace of death, after twenty-two months\n     of unjust and unearned suffering.  I first saw her thirty-seven\n     years ago, and now I have looked upon her face for the last time....\n     I was full of remorse for things done and said in these thirty-\n     four years of married life that have hurt Livy’s heart.”",
        "And to Howells a few days later:",
        "“To-day, treasured in her worn, old testament, I found a dear and\n     gentle letter from you dated Far Rockaway, September 12, 1896, about\n     our poor Susy’s death.  I am tired and old; I wish I were with Livy.”",
        "They brought her to America; and from the house, and the rooms, where she\nhad been made a bride bore her to a grave beside Susy and little Langdon.",
        "In a small cottage belonging to Richard Watson Gilder, at Tyringham,\nMassachusetts, Samuel Clemens and his daughters tried to plan for the\nfuture.  Mrs. Clemens had always been the directing force–they were lost\nwithout her.  They finally took a house in New York City, No. 21 Fifth\nAvenue, at the corner of Ninth Street, installed the familiar\nfurnishings, and tried once more to establish a home.  The house was\nhandsome within and without–a proper residence for a venerable author\nand sage–a suitable setting for Mark Twain.  But it was lonely for him.",
        "It lacked soul–comfort that would reach the heart.  He added presently a\ngreat Aeolian orchestrelle, with a variety of music for his different\nmoods.  Sometimes he played it himself, though oftener his secretary\nplayed to him.  He went out little that winter–seeing only a few old and\nintimate friends.  His writing, such as it was, was of a serious nature,\nprotests against oppression and injustice in a variety of forms.  Once he\nwrote a “War Prayer,” supposed to have been made by a mysterious, white-\nrobed stranger who enters a church during those ceremonies that precede\nthe marching of the nation’s armies to battle.  The minister had prayed\nfor victory, a prayer which the stranger interprets as a petition that\nthe enemy’s country be laid waste, its soldiers be torn by shells, its\npeople turned out roofless, to wander through their desolated land in\nrags and hunger.  It was a scathing arraignment of war, a prophecy,\nindeed, which to-day has been literally fulfilled.  He did not print it,\nbecause then it would have been regarded as sacrilege.",
        "When summer came again, in a beautiful house at Dublin, New Hampshire, on\nthe Monadnock slope, he seemed to get back into the old swing of work,\nand wrote that pathetic story, “A Horse’s Tale.”  Also “Eve’s Diary,\"\nwhich, under its humor, is filled with tenderness, and he began a wildly\nfantastic tale entitled “Three Thousand Years Among the Microbes,” a\nsatire in which Gulliver is outdone.  He never finished it.  He never\ncould finish it, for it ran off into amazing by-paths that led nowhere,\nand the tale was lost.  Yet he always meant to get at it again some day\nand make order out of chaos.",
        "Old friends were dying, and Mark Twain grew more and more lonely.  “My\nsection of the procession has but a little way to go,” he wrote when the\ngreat English actor Henry Irving died.  Charles Henry Webb, his first\npublisher, John Hay, Bret Harte, Thomas B. Reed, and, indeed, most of his\nearlier associates were gone.  When an invitation came from San Francisco\nto attend a California reunion he replied that his wandering days were\nover and that it was his purpose to sit by the fire for the rest of his\nlife.  And in another letter:",
        "“I have done more for San Francisco than any other of its old\n     residents.  Since I left there, it has increased in population fully\n     300,000.  I could have done more–I could have gone earlier–it was\n     suggested.”",
        "A choice example, by the way, of Mark Twain’s best humor, with its\nperfectly timed pause, and the afterthought.  Most humorists would have\nbeen content to end with the statement, “I could have gone earlier.\"\nOnly Mark Twain could have added that final exquisite touch–\"it was\nsuggested.”",
        "Mark Twain was nearing seventy.  With the 30th of November (1905) he\nwould complete the scriptural limitation, and the president of his\npublishing-house, Col. George Harvey, of Harper’s, proposed a great\ndinner for him in celebration of his grand maturity.  Clemens would have\npreferred a small assembly in some snug place, with only his oldest and\nclosest friends.  Colonel Harvey had a different view.  He had given a\nsmall, choice dinner to Mark Twain on his sixty-seventh birthday; now it\nmust be something really worth while–something to outrank any former\nliterary gathering.  In order not to conflict with Thanksgiving holidays,\nthe 5th of December was selected as the date.  On that evening, two\nhundred American and English men and women of letters assembled in\nDelmonico’s great banquet-hall to do honor to their chief.  What an\noccasion it was!  The tables of gay diners and among them Mark Twain, his\nsnow-white hair a gleaming beacon for every eye.  Then, by and by,\npresented by William Dean Howells, he rose to speak.  Instantly the\nbrilliant throng was on its feet, a shouting billow of life, the white\nhandkerchiefs flying foam-like on its crest.  It was a supreme moment!\nThe greatest one of them all hailed by their applause as he scaled the\nmountaintop.",
        "Never did Mark Twain deliver a more perfect address than he gave that\nnight.  He began with the beginning, the meagerness of that little hamlet\nthat had seen his birth, and sketched it all so quaintly and delightfully\nthat his hearers laughed and shouted, though there was tenderness under\nit, and often the tears were just beneath the surface.  He told of his\nhabits of life, how he had reached seventy by following a plan of living\nthat would probably kill anybody else; how, in fact, he believed he had\nno valuable habits at all.  Then, at last, came that unforgetable close:",
        "“Threescore years and ten!",
        "“It is the scriptural statute of limitations.  After that you owe no\n     active duties; for you the strenuous life is over.  You are a time-\n     expired man, to use Kipling’s military phrase: you have served your\n     term, well or less well, and you are mustered out.  You are become\n     an honorary member of the republic, you are emancipated, compulsions\n     are not for you, nor any bugle-call but “lights out.”  You pay the\n     time-worn duty bills if you choose, or decline, if you prefer–and\n     without prejudice–for they are not legally collectable.",
        "“The previous-engagement plea, which in forty years has cost you so\n     many twinges, you can lay aside forever; on this side of the grave\n     you will never need it again.  If you shrink at thought of night,\n     and winter, and the late homecomings from the banquet and the lights\n     and laughter, through the deserted streets–a desolation which would\n     not remind you now, as for a generation it did, that your friends\n     are sleeping and you must creep in a-tiptoe and not disturb them,\n     but would only remind you that you need not tiptoe, you can never\n     disturb them more–if you shrink at the thought of these things you\n     need only reply, ’Your invitation honors me and pleases me because\n     you still keep me in your remembrance, but I am seventy; seventy,\n     and would nestle in the chimney-corner, and smoke my pipe, and read\n     my book, and take my rest, wishing you well in all affection, and\n     that when you, in your turn, shall arrive at Pier 70 you may step\n     aboard your waiting ship with a reconciled spirit, and lay your\n     course toward the sinking sun with a contented heart.’”",
        "The tears that had been lying in wait were no longer kept back.  If there\nwere any present who did not let them flow without shame, who did not\nshout their applause from throats choked with sobs, they failed to\nmention the fact later.",
        "Many of his old friends, one after another, rose to tell their love for\nhim–Cable, Carnegie, Gilder, and the rest.  Mr. Rogers did not speak,\nnor the Reverend Twichell, but they sat at his special table.  Aldrich\ncould not be there, but wrote a letter.  A group of English authors,\nincluding Alfred Austin, Barrie, Chesterton, Dobson, Doyle, Hardy,\nKipling, Lang, and others, joined in a cable.  Helen Keller wrote:",
        "     “And you are seventy years old?  Or is the report exaggerated, like\n     that of your death?  I remember, when I saw you last, at the house\n     of dear Mr. Hutton, in Princeton, you said:",
        "     “’If a man is a pessimist before he is forty-eight, he knows too\n     much.  If he is an optimist after he is forty-eight, he knows too\n     little.’",
        "     “Now we know you are an optimist, and nobody would dare to accuse one\n     on the “seven-terraced summit” of knowing little.  So probably you\n     are not seventy, after all, but only forty-seven!”",
        "Helen Keller was right.  Mark Twain was never a pessimist in his heart.",
        "It was at the beginning of 1906–a little more than a month after the\nseventieth-birthday dinner–that the writer of these chapters became\npersonally associated with Mark Twain.  I had met him before, and from\ntime to time he had returned a kindly word about some book I had written\nand inconsiderately sent him, for he had been my literary hero from\nchildhood.  Once, indeed, he had allowed me to use some of his letters in\na biography I was writing of Thomas Nast; he had been always an admirer\nof the great cartoonist, and the permission was kindness itself.  Before\nthe seating at the birthday dinner I happened to find myself for a moment\nalone with Mark Twain and remembered to thank him in person for the use\nof the letters; a day or two later I sent him a copy of the book.  I did\nnot expect to hear from it again.",
        "It was a little while after this that I was asked to join in a small\nprivate dinner to be given to Mark Twain at the Players, in celebration\nof his being made an honorary member of that club–there being at the\ntime only one other member of this class, Sir Henry Irving.  I was in the\nPlayers a day or two before the event, and David Munro, of “The North\nAmerican Review,” a man whose gentle and kindly nature made him “David\"\nto all who knew him, greeted me joyfully, his face full of something he\nknew I would wish to hear.",
        "He had been chosen, he said, to propose the Players’ dinner to Mark\nTwain, and had found him propped up in bed, and beside him a copy of the\nNast book.  I suspect now that David’s generous heart prompted Mark Twain\nto speak of the book, and that his comment had lost nothing in David’s\neager retelling.  But I was too proud and happy to question any feature\nof the precious compliment, and Munro–always most happy in making others\nhappy–found opportunity to repeat it, and even to improve upon it–\nusually in the presence of others–several times during the evening.",
        "The Players’ dinner to Mark Twain was given on the evening of January 3,\n19066, and the picture of it still remains clear to me.  The guests,\nassembled around a single table in the private dining-room, did not\nexceed twenty-five in number.  Brander Matthews presided, and the\nknightly Frank Millet, who would one day go down on the “Titanic,” was\nthere, and Gilder and Munro and David Bispham and Robert Reid, and others\nof their kind.  It so happened that my seat was nearly facing the guest\nof the evening, who by a custom of the Players is placed at the side and\nnot at the distant end of the long table.  Regarding him at leisure, I\nsaw that he seemed to be in full health.  He had an alert, rested look;\nhis complexion had the tints of a miniature painting.  Lit by the soft\nglow of the shaded candles, outlined against the richness of the shadowed\nwalls, he made a figure of striking beauty.  I could not take my eyes\nfrom it, for it stirred in me the farthest memories.  I saw the interior\nof a farm-house sitting-room in the Middle West where I had first heard\nthe name of Mark Twain, and where night after night a group had gathered\naround the evening lamp to hear read aloud the story of the Innocents on\ntheir Holy Land pilgrimage, which to a boy of eight had seemed only a\nwonderful poem and fairy-tale.  To Charles Harvey Genung, who sat next to\nme, I whispered something of this, and how during the thirty-six years\nsince then no one had meant to me quite what Mark Twain had meant–in\nliterature and, indeed, in life.  Now here he was just across the table.\nIt was a fairy-tale come true.",
        "Genung said: “You should write his life.”",
        "It seemed to me no more than a pleasant remark, but he came back to it\nagain and again, trying to encourage me with the word that Munro had\nbrought back concerning the biography of Nast.  However, nothing of what\nhe said had kindled any spark of hope.  I put him off by saying that\ncertainly some one of longer and closer friendship and larger experience\nhad been selected for the work.  Then the speaking began, and the matter\nwent out of my mind.  Later in the evening, when we had left our seats\nand were drifting about the table, I found a chance to say a word to our\nguest concerning his “Joan of Arc,” which I had recently re-read.  To my\nhappiness, he told me that long-ago incident–the stray leaf from Joan’s\nlife, blown to him by the wind–which had led to his interest in all\nliterature.  Then presently I was with Genung again and he was still\ninsisting that I write the life of Mark Twain.  It may have been his\nfaithful urging, it may have been the quick sympathy kindled by the name\nof “Joan of Arc\"; whatever it was, in the instant of bidding good-by to\nour guest I was prompted to add:",
        "“May I call to see you, Mr. Clemens, some day?”  And something–to this\nday I do not know what–prompted him to answer:",
        "“Yes, come soon.”",
        "Two days later, by appointment with his secretary, I arrived at 21 Fifth\nAvenue, and waited in the library to be summoned to his room.  A few\nmoments later I was ascending the long stairs, wondering why I had come\non so useless an errand, trying to think up an excuse for having come at\nall.",
        "He was propped up in bed–a regal bed, from a dismantled Italian palace–\ndelving through a copy of “Huckleberry Finn,” in search of a paragraph\nconcerning which some unknown correspondent had inquired.  He pushed the\ncigars toward me, commenting amusingly on this correspondent and on\nletter-writing in general.  By and by, when there came a lull, I told him\nwhat so many thousands had told him before–what his work had meant to\nme, so long ago, and recalled my childish impressions of that large\nblack-and-gilt book with its wonderful pictures and adventures “The\nInnocents Abroad.”  Very likely he was willing enough to let me change\nthe subject presently and thank him for the kindly word which David Munro\nhad brought.  I do not remember what was his comment, but I suddenly\nfound myself saying that out of his encouragement had grown a hope\n(though certainly it was less), that I might some day undertake a book\nabout himself.  I expected my errand to end at this point, and his\nsilence seemed long and ominous.",
        "He said at last that from time to time he had himself written chapters of\nhis life, but that he had always tired of the work and put it aside.  He\nadded that he hoped his daughters would one day collect his letters, but\nthat a biography–a detailed story of a man’s life and effort–was\nanother matter.  I think he added one or two other remarks, then all at\nonce, turning upon me those piercing agate-blue eyes, he said:",
        "“When would you like to begin?”",
        "There was a dresser, with a large mirror, at the end of the room.  I\nhappened to catch my reflection in it, and I vividly recollect saying to\nit, mentally “This is not true; it is only one of many similar dreams.\"\nBut even in a dream one must answer, and I said:",
        "“Whenever you like.  I can begin now.”",
        "He was always eager in any new undertaking.",
        "“Very good,” he said, “the sooner, then, the better.  Let’s begin while\nwe are in the humor.  The longer you postpone a thing of this kind, the\nless likely you are ever to get at it.”",
        "This was on Saturday; I asked if Tuesday, January 9, would be too soon to\nstart.  He agreed that Tuesday would do, and inquired as to my plan of\nwork.  I suggested bringing a stenographer to make notes of his life-\nstory as he could recall it, this record to be supplemented by other\nmaterial–letters, journals, and what not.  He said:",
        "“I think I should enjoy dictating to a stenographer with some one to\nprompt me and act as audience.  The room adjoining this was fitted up for\nmy study.  My manuscript and notes and private books and many of my\nletters are there, and there are a trunkful or two of such things in the\nattic.  I seldom use the room myself.  I do my writing and reading in\nbed.  I will turn that room over to you for this work.  Whatever you need\nwill be brought to you.  We can have the dictations here in the morning,\nand you can put in the rest of the day to suit yourself.  You can have a\nkey and come and go as you please.”",
        "That was always his way.  He did nothing by halves.  He got up and showed\nme the warm luxury of the study, with its mass of material–disordered,\nbut priceless.",
        "I have no distinct recollections of how I came away, but presently, back\nat the Players, I was confiding the matter to Charles Harvey Genung, who\nsaid he was not surprised; but I think he was.",
        "It was true, after all; and on Tuesday morning, January 9, 1906, I was on\nhand with a capable stenographer, ready to begin.  Clemens, meantime, had\ndeveloped a new idea: he would like to add, he said, the new dictations\nto his former beginnings, completing an autobiography which was to be\nlaid away and remain unpublished for a hundred years.  He would pay the\nstenographer himself, and own the notes, allowing me, of course, free use\nof them as material for my book.  He did not believe that he could follow\nthe story of his life in its order of dates, but would find it necessary\nto wander around, picking up the thread as memory or fancy prompted.  I\ncould suggest subjects and ask questions.  I assented to everything, and\nwe set to work immediately.",
        "As on my former visit, he was in bed when we arrived, though clad now in\na rich Persian dressing gown, and propped against great, snowy pillows.\nA small table beside him held his pipes, cigars, papers, also a reading-\nlamp, the soft light of which brought out his brilliant coloring and the\ngleam of his snowy hair.  There was daylight, too, but it was dull winter\ndaylight, from the north, while the walls of the room were a deep,\nunreflecting red.",
        "He began that morning with some memories of the Comstock mine; then he\ndropped back to his childhood, closing at last with some comment on\nmatters quite recent.  How delightful it was–his quaint, unhurried\nfashion of speech, the unconscious habits of his delicate hands, the play\nof his features as his fancies and phrases passed through his mind and\nwere accepted or put aside.  We were watching one of the great literary\ncreators of his time in the very process of his architecture.  Time did\nnot count.  When he finished, at last, we were all amazed to find that\nmore than two hours had slipped away.",
        "“And how much I have enjoyed it,” he said.  “It is the ideal plan for\nthis kind of work.  Narrative writing is always disappointing.  The\nmoment you pick up a pen you begin to lose the spontaneity of the\npersonal relation, which contains the very essence of interest.  With\nshort-hand dictation one can talk as if he were at his own dinner-table\nalways an inspiring place.  I expect to dictate all the rest of my life,\nif you good people are willing to come and listen to it.”",
        "The dictations thus begun continued steadily from week to week, with\nincreasing charm.  We never knew what he was going to talk about, and it\nwas seldom that he knew until the moment of beginning.  But it was always\nfascinating, and I felt myself the most fortunate biographer in the\nworld, as indeed I was.",
        "It was not all smooth sailing, however.  In the course of time I began to\nrealize that these marvelous dictated chapters were not altogether\nhistory, but were often partly, or even entirely, imaginary.  The creator\nof Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn had been embroidering old incidents or\ninventing new ones too long to stick to history now, to be able to\nseparate the romance in his mind from the reality of the past.  Also, his\nmemory of personal events had become inaccurate.  He realized this, and\nonce said, in his whimsical, gentle way:",
        "“When I was younger I could remember anything, whether it happened\n     or not; but I am getting old, and soon I shall remember only the\n     latter.”",
        "Yet it was his constant purpose to stick to fact, and especially did he\nmake no effort to put himself in a good light.  Indeed, if you wanted to\nknow the worst of Mark Twain you had only to ask him for it.  He would\ngive it to the last syllable, and he would improve upon it and pile up\nhis sins, and sometimes the sins of others, without stint.  Certainly the\ndictations were precious, for they revealed character as nothing else\ncould; but as material for history they often failed to stand the test of\nthe documents in the next room–the letters, notebooks, agreements, and\nthe like–from which I was gradually rebuilding the structure of the\nyears.",
        "In the talks that we usually had when the dictations were ended and the\nstenographer had gone I got much that was of great value.  It was then\nthat I usually made those inquiries which we had planned in the\nbeginning, and his answers, coming quickly and without reflection, gave\nimagination less play.  Sometimes he would touch some point of special\ninterest and walk up and down, philosophizing, or commenting upon things\nin general, in a manner not always complimentary to humanity and its\nprogress.",
        "I seldom asked him a question during the dictation–or interrupted in any\nway, though he had asked me to stop him when I found him repeating or\ncontradicting himself, or misstating some fact known to me.  At first I\nlacked the courage to point out a mistake at the moment, and cautiously\nmentioned the matter when he had finished.  Then he would be likely to\nsay:",
        "“Why didn’t you stop me?  Why did you let me go on making a donkey\n     of myself when you could have saved me?”",
        "So then I used to take the risk of getting struck by lightning, and\nnearly always stopped him in time.  But if it happened that I upset his\nthought, the thunderbolt was apt to fly.  He would say:",
        "“Now you’ve knocked everything out of my head.”",
        "Then, of course, I was sorry and apologized, and in a moment the sky was\nclear again.  There was generally a humorous complexion to the\ndictations, whatever the subject.  Humor was his natural breath of life,\nand rarely absent.",
        "Perhaps I should have said sooner that he smoked continuously during the\ndictations.  His cigars were of that delicious fragrance which belongs to\ndomestic tobacco.  They were strong and inexpensive, and it was only his\nearly training that made him prefer them.  Admiring friends used to send\nhim costly, imported cigars, but he rarely touched them, and they were\nsmoked by visitors.  He often smoked a pipe, and preferred it to be old\nand violent.  Once when he had bought a new, expensive briar-root, he\nhanded it to me, saying:",
        "“I’d like to have you smoke that a year or two, and when it gets so you\ncan’t stand it, maybe it will suit me.”",
        "Following his birthday dinner, Mark Twain had become once more the “Belle\nof New York,” and in a larger way than ever before.  An editorial in the\n\"Evening Mail” referred to him as a kind of joint Aristides, Solon, and\nThemistocles of the American metropolis, and added:",
        "“Things have reached a point where, if Mark Twain is not at a public\n     meeting or banquet, he is expected to console it with one of his\n     inimitable letters of advice and encouragement.”",
        "He loved the excitement of it, and it no longer seemed to wear upon him.\nScarcely an evening passed that he did not go out to some dinner or\ngathering where he had promised to speak.  In April, for the benefit of\nthe Robert Fulton Society, he delivered his farewell lecture–the last\nlecture, he said, where any one would have to pay to hear him.  It was at\nCarnegie Hall, and the great place was jammed.  As he stood before that\nvast, shouting audience, I wondered if he was remembering that night,\nforty years before in San Francisco, when his lecture career had begun.\nWe hoped he might speak of it, but he did not do so.",
        "In May the dictations were transferred to Dublin, New Hampshire, to the\nlong veranda of the Upton House, on the Monadnock slope.  He wished to\ncontinue our work, he said; so the stenographer and myself were presently\nlocated in the village, and drove out each morning, to sit facing one of\nthe rarest views in all New England, while he talked of everything and\nanything that memory or fancy suggested.  We had begun in his bedroom,\nbut the glorious outside was too compelling.",
        "The long veranda was ideal.  He was generally ready when we arrived, a\nluminous figure in white flannels, pacing up and down before a background\nof sky and forest, blue lake, and distant hills.  When it stormed we\nwould go inside to a bright fire.  The dictation ended, he would ask his\nsecretary to play the orchestrelle, which at great expense had been\nfreighted up from New York.  In that high situation, the fire and the\nmusic and the stormbeat seemed to lift us very far indeed from reality.\nCertain symphonies by Beethoven, an impromptu by Schubert, and a nocturne\nby Chopin were the selections he cared for most,[12] though in certain\nmoods he asked, for the Scotch melodies.",
        "There was a good deal of social life in Dublin, but, the dictations were\nseldom interrupted.  He became lonely, now and then, and paid a brief\nvisit to New York, or to Mr. Rogers in Fairhaven, but he always returned\ngladly, for he liked the rest and quiet, and the dictations gave him\nemployment.  A part of his entertainment was a trio of kittens which he\nhad rented for the summer–rented because then they would not lose\nownership and would find home and protection in the fall.  He named the\nkittens Sackcloth and Ashes–Sackcloth being a black-and-white kit, and\nAshes a joint name owned by the two others, who were gray and exactly\nalike.  All summer long these merry little creatures played up and down\nthe wide veranda, or chased butterflies and grasshoppers down the clover\nslope, offering Mark Twain never-ending amusement.  He loved to see them\nspring into the air after some insect, miss it, tumble back, and quickly\njump up again with a surprised and disappointed expression.",
        "In spite of his resolve not to print any of his autobiography until he\nhad been dead a hundred years, he was persuaded during the summer to\nallow certain chapters of it to be published in “The North American\nReview.”  With the price received, thirty thousand dollars, he announced\nhe was going to build himself a country home at Redding, Connecticut, on\nland already purchased there, near a small country place of my own.  He\nwished to have a fixed place to go each summer, he said, and his thought\nwas to call it “Autobiography House.”",
        "[12] His special favorites were Schubert’s Op. 142, part 2, and Chopin’s\nOp. 37, part 2.",
        "With the return to New York I began a period of closer association with\nMark Twain.  Up to that time our relations had been chiefly of a literary\nnature.  They now became personal as well.",
        "It happened in this way: Mark Twain had never outgrown his love for the\ngame of billiards, though he had not owned a table since the closing of\nthe Hartford house, fifteen years before.  Mrs. Henry Rogers had proposed\nto present him with a table for Christmas, but when he heard of the plan,\nboylike, he could not wait, and hinted that if he had the table “right\nnow” he could begin to use it sooner.  So the table came–a handsome\ncombination affair, suitable to all games–and was set in place.  That\nmorning when the dictation ended he said:",
        "“Have you any special place to lunch, to-day?”",
        "I replied that I had not.",
        "“Lunch here,” he said, “and we’ll try the new billiard-table.”",
        "I acknowledged that I had never played more than a few games of pool, and\nthose very long ago.",
        "“No matter,” he said “the poorer you play the better I shall like it.”",
        "So I remained for luncheon, and when it was over we began the first game\never played on the “Christmas” table.  He taught me a game in which\ncaroms and pockets both counted, and he gave me heavy odds.  He beat me,\nbut it was a riotous, rollicking game, the beginning of a closer relation\nbetween us.  We played most of the afternoon, and he suggested that I\n\"come back in the evening and play some more.”  I did so, and the game\nlasted till after midnight.  I had beginner’s luck–\"nigger luck,” as he\ncalled it–and it kept him working feverishly to win.  Once when I had\nmade a great fluke–a carom followed by most of the balls falling into\nthe pockets, he said:",
        "“When you pick up that cue this table drips at every pore.”",
        "The morning dictations became a secondary interest.  Like a boy, he was\nlooking forward to the afternoon of play, and it seemed never to come\nquickly enough to suit him.  I remained regularly for luncheon, and he\nwas inclined to cut the courses short that we might the sooner get up-\nstairs for billiards.  He did not eat the midday meal himself, but he\nwould come down and walk about the dining-room, talking steadily that\nmarvelous, marvelous talk which little by little I trained myself to\nremember, though never with complete success.  He was only killing time,\nand I remember once, when he had been earnestly discussing some deep\nquestion, he suddenly noticed that the luncheon was ending.",
        "“Now,” he said, “we will proceed to more serious matters–it’s your–\nshot.”",
        "My game improved with practice, and he reduced my odds.  He was willing\nto be beaten, but not too often.  We kept a record of the games, and he\nwent to bed happier if the tally-sheet showed a balance in his favor.",
        "He was not an even-tempered player.  When the game went steadily against\nhim he was likely to become critical, even fault-finding, in his remarks.\nThen presently he would be seized with remorse and become over-gentle and\nattentive, placing the balls as I knocked them into the pockets, hurrying\nto render this service.  I wished he would not do it.  It distressed me\nthat he should humble himself.  I was willing that he should lose his\ntemper, that he should be even harsh if he felt so inclined–his age, his\nposition, his genius gave him special privileges.  Yet I am glad, as I\nremember it now, that the other side revealed itself, for it completes\nthe sum of his humanity.  Once in a burst of exasperation he made such an\nonslaught on the balls that he landed a couple of them on the floor.  I\ngathered them up and we went on playing as if nothing had happened, only\nhe was very gentle and sweet, like a summer meadow when the storm has\npassed by.  Presently he said:",
        "“This is a most amusing game.  When you play badly it amuses me, and\n     when I play badly and lose my temper it certainly must amuse you.”",
        "It was but natural that friendship should grow under such conditions.\nThe disparity of our ages and gifts no longer mattered.  The pleasant\nland of play is a democracy where such things do not count.",
        "We celebrated his seventy-first birthday by playing billiards all day.\nHe invented a new game for the occasion, and added a new rule for it with\nalmost every shot.  It happened that no other member of the family was at\nhome–ill-health had banished every one, even the secretary.  Flowers,\ntelegrams, and congratulations came, and a string of callers.  He saw no\none but a few intimate friends.",
        "We were entirely alone for dinner, and I felt the great honor of being\nhis only guest on such an occasion.  On that night, a year before, the\nflower of his profession had assembled to do him honor.  Once between the\ncourses, when he rose, as was his habit, to walk about, he wandered into\nthe drawing-room, and, seating himself at the orchestrelle, began to play\nthe beautiful “Flower Song” from Faust.  It was a thing I had not seen\nhim do before, and I never saw him do it again.\nHe was in his loveliest humor all that day and evening, and at night when\nwe stopped playing he said:",
        "“I have never had a pleasanter day at this game.”",
        "I answered: “I hope ten years from to-night we shall be playing it.”",
        "“Yes,” he said, “still playing the best game on earth.”",
        "I accompanied him on a trip he made to Washington in the interest of\ncopyright.  Speaker “Uncle Joe” Cannon lent us his private room in the\nCapitol, and there all one afternoon Mark Twain received Congressmen, and\nin an atmosphere blue with cigar-smoke preached the gospel of copyright.\nIt was a historic trip, and for me an eventful one, for it was on the way\nback to New York that Mark Twain suggested that I take up residence in\nhis home.  There was a room going to waste, he said, and I would be\nhandier for the early and late billiard sessions.  I accepted, of course.",
        "Looking back, now, I see pretty vividly three quite distinct pictures.\nOne of them, the rich, red interior of the billiard-room, with the\nbrilliant green square in the center on which the gay balls are rolling,\nand bent over it his luminous white figure in the instant of play.  Then\nthere is the long lighted drawing-room, with the same figure stretched on\na couch in the corner, drowsily smoking while the rich organ tones summon\nfor him scenes and faces which the others do not see.  Sometimes he rose,\npacing the length of the parlors, but oftener he lay among the cushions,\nthe light flooding his white hair and dress, heightening his brilliant\ncoloring.  He had taken up the fashion of wearing white altogether at\nthis time.  Black, he said, reminded him of his funerals.",
        "The third picture is that of the dinner-table–always beautifully laid,\nand always a shrine of wisdom when he was there.  He did not always talk,\nbut he often did, and I see him clearest, his face alive with interest,\npresenting some new angle of thought in his vivid, inimitable speech.\nThese are pictures that will not fade from my memory.  How I wish the\nmarvelous things he said were like them!  I preserved as much of them as\nI could, and in time trained myself to recall portions of his exact\nphrasing.  But even so they seemed never quite as he had said them.  They\nlacked the breath of his personality.  His dinner-table talk was likely\nto be political, scientific, philosophic.  He often discussed aspects of\nastronomy, which was a passion with him.  I could succeed better with the\nbilliard-room talk–that was likely to be reminiscent, full of anecdotes.\nI kept a pad on the window-sill, and made notes while he was playing.  At\none time he told me of his dreams.",
        "“There is never a month passes,” he said, “that I do not dream of being\nin reduced circumstances and obliged to go back to the river to earn a\nliving.  Usually in my dream I am just about to start into a black shadow\nwithout being able to tell whether it is Selma Bluff, or Hat Island, or\nonly a black wall of night.  Another dream I have is being compelled to\ngo back to the lecture platform.  In it I am always getting up before an\naudience, with nothing to say, trying to be funny, trying to make the\naudience laugh, realizing I am only making silly jokes.  Then the\naudience realizes it, and pretty soon they commence to get up and leave.\nThat dream always ends by my standing there in the semi-darkness talking\nto an empty house.”",
        "He did not return to Dublin the next summer, but took a house at Tuxedo,\nnearer New York.  I did not go there with him, for in the spring it was\nagreed that I should make a pilgrimage to the Mississippi and the Pacific\ncoast to see those few still remaining who had known Mark Twain in his\nyouth.  John Briggs was alive, also Horace Bixby, “Joe” Goodman, Steve\nand Jim Gillis, and there were a few others.",
        "It was a trip taken none too soon.  John Briggs, a gentle-hearted old man\nwho sat by his fire and through one afternoon told me of the happy days\nalong the river-front from the cave to Holliday’s Hill, did not reach the\nend of the year.  Horace Bixby, at eighty-one, was still young, and\npiloting a government snag-boat.  Neither was Joseph Goodman old, by any\nmeans, but Jim Gillis was near his end, and Steve Gillis was an invalid,\nwho said:",
        "“Tell Sam I’m going to die pretty soon, but that I love him; that I’ve\nloved him all my life, and I’ll love him till I die.”",
        "On my return I found Mark Twain elated: he had been invited to England to\nreceive the degree of Literary Doctor from the Oxford University.  It is\nthe highest scholastic honorary degree; and to come back, as I had, from\nfollowing the early wanderings of the barefoot truant of Hannibal, only\nto find him about to be officially knighted by the world’s most venerable\ninstitution of learning, seemed rather the most surprising chapter even\nof his marvelous fairy-tale.  If Tom Sawyer had owned the magic wand, he\nhardly could have produced anything as startling as that.",
        "He sailed on the 8th of June, 1907, exactly forty years from the day he\nhad sailed on the “Quaker City” to win his greater fame.  I did not\naccompany him.  He took with him a secretary to make notes, and my\naffairs held me in America.  He was absent six weeks, and no attentions\nthat England had ever paid him before could compare with her lavish\nwelcome during this visit.  His reception was really national.  He was\nbanqueted by the greatest clubs of London, he was received with special\nfavor at the King’s garden party, he traveled by a royal train, crowds\ngathering everywhere to see him pass.  At Oxford when he appeared on the\nstreet the name Mark Twain ran up and down like a cry of fire, and the\npeople came running.  When he appeared on the stage at the Sheldonian\nTheater to receive his degree, clad in his doctor’s robe of scarlet and\ngray, there arose a great tumult–the shouting of the undergraduates for\nthe boy who had been Tom Sawyer and had played with Huckleberry Finn.\nThe papers next day spoke of his reception as a “cyclone,” surpassing any\nother welcome, though Rudyard Kipling was one of those who received\ndegrees on that occasion, and General Booth and Whitelaw Reid, and other\nfamous men.",
        "Perhaps the most distinguished social honor paid to Mark Twain at this\ntime was the dinner given him by the staff of London “Punch,” in the\nhistoric “Punch” editorial rooms on Bouverie Street.  No other foreigner\nhad ever been invited to that sacred board, where Thackeray had sat, and\nDouglas Jerrold and others of the great departed.  “Punch” had already\nsaluted him with a front-page cartoon, and at this dinner the original\ndrawing was presented to him by the editor’s little daughter, Joy Agnew.",
        "The Oxford degree, and the splendid homage paid him by England at large,\nbecame, as it were, the crowning episode of Mark Twain’s career.  I think\nhe realized this, although he did not speak of it–indeed, he had very\nlittle to say of the whole matter.  I telephoned a greeting when I knew\nthat he had arrived in New York, and was summoned to “come down and play\nbilliards.”  I confess I went with a good deal of awe, prepared to sit in\nsilence and listen to the tale of the returning hero.  But when I arrived\nhe was already in the billiard-room, knocking the balls about–his coat\noff, for it was a hot night.  As I entered, he said:",
        "“Get your cue–I’ve been inventing a new game.”",
        "That was all.  The pageant was over, the curtain was rung down.  Business\nwas resumed at the old stand.",
        "There followed another winter during which I was much with Mark Twain,\nthough a part of it he spent with Mr. Rogers in Bermuda, that pretty\nisland resort which both men loved.  Then came spring again, and June,\nand with it Mark Twain’s removal to his newly built home, “Stormfield,\"\nat Redding, Connecticut.",
        "The house had been under construction for a year.  He had never seen it–\nnever even seen the land I had bought for him.  He even preferred not to\nlook at any plans or ideas for decoration.",
        "“When the house is finished and furnished, and the cat is purring on the\nhearth, it will be time enough for me to see it,” he had said more than\nonce.",
        "He had only specified that the rooms should be large and that the\nbilliard-room should be red.  His billiard-rooms thus far had been of\nthat color, and their memory was associated in his mind with enjoyment\nand comfort.  He detested details of preparation, and then, too, he\nlooked forward to the dramatic surprise of walking into a home that had\nbeen conjured into existence as with a word.",
        "It was the 18th of June, 1908, that he finally took possession.  The\nFifth Avenue house was not dismantled, for it was the plan then to use\nStormfield only as a summer place.  The servants, however, with one\nexception, had been transferred to Redding, and Mark Twain and I remained\nalone, though not lonely, in the city house; playing billiards most of\nthe time, and being as hilarious as we pleased, for there was nobody to\ndisturb.  I think he hardly mentioned the new home during that time.  He\nhad never seen even a photograph of the place, and I confess I had\nmoments of anxiety, for I had selected the site and had been more or less\nconcerned otherwise, though John Howells was wholly responsible for the\nbuilding.  I did not really worry, for I knew how beautiful and peaceful\nit all was.",
        "The morning of the 18th was bright and sunny and cool.  Mark Twain was up\nand shaved by six o’clock in order to be in time.  The train did not\nleave until four in the afternoon, but our last billiards in town must\nbegin early and suffer no interruption.  We were still playing when,\nabout three, word was brought up that the cab was waiting.  Arrived at\nthe station, a group collected, reporters and others, to speed him to his\nnew home.  Some of the reporters came along.",
        "The scenery was at its best that day, and he spoke of it approvingly.\nThe hour and a half required to cover the sixty miles’ distance seemed\nshort.  The train porters came to carry out the bags.  He drew from his\npocket a great handful of silver.",
        "“Give them something,” he said; “give everybody liberally that does any\nservice.”",
        "There was a sort of open-air reception in waiting–a varied assemblage of\nvehicles festooned with flowers had gathered to offer gallant country\nwelcome.  It was a perfect June evening, still and dream-like; there\nseemed a spell of silence on everything.  The people did not cheer–they\nsmiled and waved to the white figure, and he smiled and waved reply, but\nthere was no noise.  It was like a scene in a cinema.",
        "His carriage led the way on the three-mile drive to the house on the\nhilltop, and the floral procession fell in behind.  Hillsides were green,\nfields were white with daisies, dogwood and laurel shone among the trees.\nHe was very quiet as we drove along.  Once, with gentle humor, looking\nout over a white daisy-field, he said:",
        "“That is buckwheat.  I always recognize buckwheat when I see it.  I\n     wish I knew as much about other things as I know about buckwheat.”",
        "The clear-running brooks, a swift-flowing river, a tumbling cascade where\nwe climbed a hill, all came in for his approval–then we were at the lane\nthat led to his new home, and the procession behind dropped away.  The\ncarriage ascended still higher, and a view opened across the Saugatuck\nValley, with its nestling village and church-spire and farmhouses, and\nbeyond them the distant hills.  Then came the house–simple in design,\nbut beautiful–an Italian villa, such as he had known in Florence,\nadapted here to American climate and needs.",
        "At the entrance his domestic staff waited to greet him, and presently he\nstepped across the threshold and stood in his own home for the first time\nin seventeen years.  Nothing was lacking–it was as finished, as\ncompletely furnished, as if he had occupied it a lifetime.  No one spoke\nimmediately, but when his eyes had taken in the harmony of the place,\nwith its restful, home-like comfort, and followed through the open French\nwindows to the distant vista of treetops and farmsides and blue hills,\nhe said, very gently:",
        "“How beautiful it all is!  I did not think it could be as beautiful\n     as this.”  And later, when he had seen all of the apartments: “It is\n     a perfect house–perfect, so far as I can see, in every detail.  It\n     might have been here always.”",
        "There were guests that first evening–a small home dinner-party–and a\nlittle later at the foot of the garden some fireworks were set off by\nneighbors inspired by Dan Beard, who had recently located in Redding.\nMark Twain, watching the rockets that announced his arrival, said,\ngently:",
        "“I wonder why they go to so much trouble for me.  I never go to any\n     trouble for anybody.”",
        "The evening closed with billiards, hilarious games, and when at midnight\nthe cues were set in the rack no one could say that Mark Twain’s first\nday in his new home had not been a happy one.",
        "Mark Twain loved Stormfield.  Almost immediately he gave up the idea of\ngoing back to New York for the winter, and I think he never entered the\nFifth Avenue house again.  The quiet and undisturbed comfort of\nStormfield came to him at the right time of life.  His day of being the\n\"Belle of New York” was over.  Now and then he attended some great\ndinner, but always under protest.  Finally he refused to go at all.  He\nhad much company during that first summer–old friends, and now and again\nyoung people, of whom he was always fond.  The billiard-room he called\n\"the aquarium,” and a frieze of Bermuda fishes, in gay prints, ran around\nthe walls.  Each young lady visitor was allowed to select one of these as\nher patron fish and attach her name to it.  Thus, as a member of the\n\"aquarium club,” she was represented in absence.  Of course there were\nseveral cats at Stormfield, and these really owned the premises.  The\nkittens scampered about the billiard-table after the balls, even when the\ngame was in progress, giving all sorts of new angles to the shots.  This\ndelighted him, and he would not for anything have discommoded or removed\none of those furry hazards.",
        "My own house was a little more than half a mile away, our lands joining,\nand daily I went up to visit him–to play billiards or to take a walk\nacross the fields.  There was a stenographer in the neighborhood, and he\ncontinued his dictations, but not regularly.  He wrote, too, now and\nthen, and finished the little book called “Is Shakespeare Dead?”",
        "Winter came.  The walks were fewer, and there was even more company; the\nhouse was gay and the billiard games protracted.  In February I made a\ntrip to Europe and the Mediterranean, to go over some of his ground\nthere.  Returning in April, I found him somewhat changed.  It was not\nthat he had grown older, or less full of life, but only less active, less\neager for gay company, and he no longer dictated, or very rarely.  His\ndaughter Jean, who had been in a health resort, was coming home to act as\nhis secretary, and this made him very happy.  We resumed our games, our\ntalks, and our long walks across the fields.  There were few guests, and\nwe were together most of the day and evening.  How beautiful the memory\nof it all is now!  To me, of course, nothing can ever be like it again in\nthis world.",
        "Mark Twain walked slowly these days.  Early in the summer there appeared\nindications of the heart trouble that less than a year later would bring\nthe end.  His doctor advised diminished smoking, and forbade the old\nhabit of lightly skipping up and down stairs.  The trouble was with the\nheart muscles, and at times there came severe deadly pains in his breast,\nbut for the most part he did not suffer.  He was allowed the walk,\nhowever, and once I showed him a part of his estate he had not seen\nbefore–a remote cedar hillside.  On the way I pointed out a little\ncorner of land which earlier he had given me to straighten our division\nline.  I told him I was going to build a study on it and call it\n\"Markland.”  I think the name pleased him.  Later he said:",
        "“If you had a place for that extra billiard-table of mine” (the Rogers\ntable, which had been left in storage in New York), “I would turn it over\nto you.”",
        "I replied that I could adapt the size of my proposed study to fit the\ntable, and he said:",
        "“Now that will be very good.  Then when I want exercise I can walk down\nand play billiards with you, and when you want exercise you can walk up\nand play billiards with me.  You must build that study.”",
        "So it was planned, and the work was presently under way.",
        "How many things we talked of!  Life, death, the future–all the things of\nwhich we know so little and love so much to talk about.  Astronomy, as I\nhave said, was one of his favorite subjects.  Neither of us had any real\nknowledge of the matter, which made its great facts all the more awesome.\nThe thought that the nearest fixed star was twenty-five trillions of\nmiles away–two hundred and fifty thousand times the distance to our own\nremote sun–gave him a sort of splendid thrill.  He would figure out\nthose appalling measurements of space, covering sheets of paper with his\nsums, but he was not a good mathematician, and the answers were generally\nwrong.  Comets in particular interested him, and one day he said:",
        "“I came in with Halley’s comet in 1835.  It is coming again next\n     year, and I expect to go out with it.  It will be the greatest\n     disappointment of my life if I don’t go out with Halley’s comet.”",
        "He looked so strong, and full of color and vitality.  One could not\nbelieve that his words held a prophecy.  Yet the pains recurred with\nincreasing frequency and severity; his malady, angina pectoris, was\nmaking progress.  And how bravely he bore it all!  He never complained,\nnever bewailed.  I have seen the fierce attack crumple him when we were\nat billiards, but he would insist on playing in his turn, bowed, his face\nwhite, his hand digging at his breast.",
        "Clara Clemens was married that autumn to Ossip Gabrilowitsch, the Russian\npianist, and presently sailed for Europe, where they would make their\nhome.  Jean Clemens was now head of the house, and what with her various\nduties and poor health, her burden was too heavy.  She had a passion for\nanimal life of every kind, and in some farm-buildings at one corner of\nthe estate had set up quite an establishment of chickens and domestic\nanimals.  She was fond of giving these her personal attention, and this,\nwith her house direction and secretarial work, gave her little time for\nrest.  I tried to relieve her of a share of the secretarial work, but she\nwas ambitious and faithful.  Still, her condition did not seem critical.",
        "I stayed at Stormfield, now, most of the time–nights as well as days–\nfor the dull weather had come and Mark Twain found the house rather\nlonely.  In November he had an impulse to go to Bermuda, and we spent a\nmonth in the warm light of that summer island, returning a week before\nthe Christmas holidays.  And just then came Mark Twain’s last great\ntragedy–the death of his daughter Jean.",
        "The holidays had added heavily to Jean’s labors.  Out of her generous\nheart she had planned gifts for everybody–had hurried to and from the\ncity for her purchases, and in the loggia set up a beautiful Christmas\ntree.  Meantime she had contracted a heavy cold.  Her trouble was\nepilepsy, and all this was bad for her.  On the morning of December 24,\nshe died, suddenly, from the shock of a cold bath.",
        "Below, in the loggia, drenched with tinsel, stood the tree, and heaped\nabout it the packages of gifts which that day she had meant to open and\nput in place.  Nobody had been overlooked.",
        "Jean was taken to Elmira for burial.  Her father, unable to make the\nwinter journey, remained behind.  Her cousin, Jervis Langdon, came for\nher.",
        "It was six in the evening when she went away.  A soft, heavy snow was\nfalling, and the gloom of the short day was closing in.  There was not\nthe least noise, the whole world was muffled.  The lanterns shone out the\nopen door, and at an upper window, the light gleaming on his white hair,\nher father watched her going away from him for the last time.  Later he\nwrote:",
        "“From my window I saw the hearse and the carriages wind along the\n     road and gradually grow vague and spectral in the falling snow, and\n     presently disappear.  Jean was gone out of my life, and would not\n     come back any more.  The cousin she had played with when they were\n     babies together–he and her beloved old Katy–were conducting her to\n     her distant childhood home, where she will lie by her mother’s side\n     once more, in the company of Susy and Langdon.”",
        "Ten days later Mark Twain returned to Bermuda, accompanied only by a\nvalet.  He had asked me if we would be willing to close our home for the\nwinter and come to Stormfield, so that the place might be ready any time\nfor his return.  We came, of course, for there was no thought other than\nfor his comfort.  He did not go to a hotel in Bermuda, but to the home of\nVice-Consul Allen, where he had visited before.  The Allens were devoted\nto him and gave him such care as no hotel could offer.",
        "Bermuda agreed with Mark Twain, and for a time there he gained in\nstrength and spirits and recovered much of his old manner.  He wrote me\nalmost daily, generally with good reports of his health and doings, and\nwith playful counsel and suggestions.  Then, by and by, he did not write\nwith his own hand, but through his newly appointed “secretary,” Mr.\nAllen’s young daughter, Helen, of whom he was very fond.  The letters,\nhowever, were still gay.  Once he said:",
        "“While the matter is in my mind I will remark that if you ever send\n     me another letter which is not paged at the top I will write you\n     with my own hand, so that I may use in utter freedom and without\n     embarrassment the kind of words which alone can describe such a\n     criminal.”",
        "He had made no mention so far of the pains in his breast, but near the\nend of March he wrote that he was coming home, if the breast pains did\nnot “mend their ways pretty considerable.  I do not want to die here,” he\nsaid.  “I am growing more and more particular about the place.”  A week\nlater brought another alarming letter, also one from Mr. Allen, who\nfrankly stated that matters had become very serious indeed.  I went to\nNew York and sailed the next morning, cabling the Gabrilowitsches to come\nwithout delay.",
        "I sent no word to Bermuda that I was coming, and when I arrived he was\nnot expecting me.",
        "“Why,” he said, holding out his hand, “you did not tell us you were\ncoming?”",
        "“No,” I said, “it is rather sudden.  I didn’t quite like the sound of\nyour last letters.”",
        "“But those were not serious.  You shouldn’t have come on my account.”",
        "I said then that I had come on my own account, that I had felt the need\nof recreation, and had decided to run down and come home with him.",
        "“That’s–very–good,” he said, in his slow, gentle fashion.  “Wow I’m\nglad to see you.”",
        "His breakfast came in and he ate with appetite.  I had thought him thin\nand pale, at first sight, but his color had come back now, and his eyes\nwere bright.  He told me of the fierce attacks of the pain, and how he\nhad been given hypodermic injections which he amusingly termed “hypnotic\ninjunctions” and “the sub-cutaneous.”  From Mr. and Mrs. Allen I learned\nhow slender had been his chances, and how uncertain were the days ahead.\nMr. Allen had already engaged passage home for April 12th.",
        "He seemed so little like a man whose days were numbered.  On the\nafternoon of my arrival we drove out, as we had done on our former visit,\nand he discussed some of the old subjects in quite the old way.  I had\nsold for him, for six thousand dollars, the farm where Jean had kept her\nanimals, and he wished to use the money in erecting for her some sort of\nmemorial.  He agreed that a building to hold the library which he had\nalready donated to the town of Redding would be appropriate and useful.\nHe asked me to write at once to his lawyer and have the matter arranged.",
        "We did not drive out again.  The pains held off for several days, and he\nwas gay and went out on the lawn, but most of the time he sat propped up\nin bed, reading and smoking.  When I looked at him there, so full of\nvigor and the joy of life, I could not persuade myself that he would not\noutlive us all.",
        "He had written very little in Bermuda–his last work being a chapter of\namusing “Advice\"–for me, as he confessed–what I was to do upon reaching\nthe gate of which St. Peter is said to keep the key.  As it is the last\nwriting he ever did, and because it is characteristic, one or two\nparagraphs may be admitted here:",
        "“Upon arrival do not speak to St. Peter until spoken to.  It is not\n     your place to begin.",
        "“Do not begin any remark with “Say.”",
        "“When applying for a ticket avoid trying to make conversation.  If\n     you must talk, let the weather alone. . .",
        "“You can ask him for his autograph–there is no harm in that–but be\n     careful and don’t remark that it is one of the penalties of\n     greatness.  He has heard that before.”",
        "There were several pages of this counsel.",
        "I spent most of each day with him, merely sitting by the bed and reading.\nI noticed when he slept that his breathing was difficult, and I could see\nthat he did not improve, but often he was gay and liked the entire family\nto gather about and be merry.  It was only a few days before we sailed\nthat the severe attacks returned.  Then followed bad nights; but respite\ncame, and we sailed on the 12th, as arranged.  The Allen home stands on\nthe water, and Mr. Allen had chartered a tug to take us to the ship.  We\nwere obliged to start early, and the fresh morning breeze was\nstimulating.  Mark Twain seemed in good spirits when we reached the\n\"Oceana,” which was to take him home.",
        "As long as I remember anything I shall remember the forty-eight hours of\nthat homeward voyage.  He was comfortable at first, and then we ran into\nthe humid, oppressive air of the Gulf Stream, and he could not breathe.\nIt seemed to me that the end might come at any moment, and this thought\nwas in his own mind, but he had no dread, and his sense of humor did not\nfail.  Once when the ship rolled and his hat fell from the hook and made\nthe circuit of the cabin floor, he said:",
        "“The ship is passing the hat.”",
        "I had been instructed in the use of the hypodermic needle, and from time\nto time gave him the “hypnotic injunction,” as he still called it.  But\nit did not afford him entire relief.  He could remain in no position for\nany length of time.  Yet he never complained and thought only of the\ntrouble he might be making.  Once he said:",
        "“I am sorry for you, Paine, but I can’t help it–I can’t hurry this\n     dying business.”",
        "And a little later:",
        "“Oh, it is such a mystery, and it takes so long!”",
        "Relatives, physicians, and news-gatherers were at the dock to welcome\nhim.  Revived by the cool, fresh air of the North, he had slept for\nseveral hours and was seemingly much better.  A special compartment on\nthe same train that had taken us first to Redding took us there now, his\nphysicians in attendance.  He did not seem to mind the trip or the drive\nhome.",
        "As we turned into the lane that led to Stormfield he said:",
        "“Can we see where you have built your billiard-room?”",
        "The gable of the new study showed among the trees, and I pointed it out\nto him.",
        "“It looks quite imposing,” he said.",
        "Arriving at Stormfield, he stepped, unassisted, from the carriage to\ngreet the members of the household, and with all his old courtliness\noffered each his hand.  Then in a canvas chair we had brought we carried\nhim up-stairs to his room–the big, beautiful room that looked out to the\nsunset hills.  This was Thursday evening, April 14, 1910.",
        "Mark Twain lived just a week from that day and hour.  For a time he\nseemed full of life, talking freely, and suffering little.  Clara and\nOssip Gabrilowitsch arrived on Saturday and found him cheerful, quite\nlike himself.  At intervals he read.  “Suetonius” and “Carlyle” lay on\nthe bed beside him, and he would pick them up and read a page or a\nparagraph.  Sometimes when I saw him thus–the high color still in his\nface, the clear light in his eyes’–I said: “It is not reality.  He is\nnot going to die.”",
        "But by Wednesday of the following week it was evident that the end was\nnear.  We did not know it then, but the mysterious messenger of his birth\nyear, Halley’s comet, became visible that night in the sky.[13]",
        "On Thursday morning, the 21st, his mind was still fairly clear, and he\nread a little from one of the volumes on his bed.  By Clara he sent word\nthat he wished to see me, and when I came in he spoke of two unfinished\nmanuscripts which he wished me to “throw away,” as he briefly expressed\nit, for his words were few, now, and uncertain.  I assured him that I\nwould attend to the matter and he pressed my hand.  It was his last word\nto me.  During the afternoon, while Clara stood by him, he sank into a\ndoze, and from it passed into a deeper slumber and did not heed us any\nmore.",
        "Through that peaceful spring afternoon the life-wave ebbed lower and\nlower.  It was about half-past six, and the sun lay just on the horizon,\nwhen Dr. Quintard noticed that the breathing, which had gradually become\nmore subdued, broke a little.  There was no suggestion of any struggle.\nThe noble head turned a little to one side, there was a fluttering sigh,\nand the breath that had been unceasing for seventy-four tumultuous years\nhad stopped forever.",
        "In the Brick Church, New York, Mark Twain–dressed in the white he loved\nso well–lay, with the nobility of death upon him, while a multitude of\nthose who loved him passed by and looked at his face for the last time.\nFlowers in profusion were banked about him, but on the casket lay a\nsingle wreath which Dan Beard and his wife had woven from the laurel\nwhich grows on Stormfield hill.  He was never more beautiful than as he\nlay there, and it was an impressive scene to see those thousands file by,\nregard him for a moment, gravely, thoughtfully, and pass on.  All sorts\nwere there, rich and poor; some crossed themselves, some saluted, some\npaused a little to take a closer look.",
        "That night we went with him to Elmira, and next day he lay in those\nstately parlors that had seen his wedding-day, and where little Langdon\nand Susy had lain, and Mrs. Clemens, and then Jean, only a little while\nbefore.",
        "The worn-out body had reached its journey’s end; but his spirit had never\ngrown old, and to-day, still young, it continues to cheer and comfort a\ntired world.",
