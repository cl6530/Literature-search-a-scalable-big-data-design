        "At twenty-three o’clock that night the Syrian priest went out to watch\nfor the coming of the messenger from Tiberias. Nearly two hours\npreviously he had heard the cry of the Russian volor that plied from\nDamascus to Tiberias, and Tiberias to Jerusalem, and even as it was the\nmessenger was a little late.",
        "These were very primitive arrangements, but Palestine was out of the\nworld–a slip of useless country–and it was necessary for a man to ride\nfrom Tiberias to Nazareth each night with papers from Cardinal Corkran\nto the Pope, and to return with correspondence. It was a dangerous task,\nand the members of the New Order who surrounded the Cardinal undertook\nit by turns. In this manner all matters for which the Pope’s personal\nattention was required, and which were too long and not too urgent,\ncould be dealt with at leisure by him, and an answer returned within the\ntwenty-four hours.",
        "It was a brilliant moonlit night. The great golden shield was riding\nhigh above Thabor, shedding its strange metallic light down the long\nslopes and over the moor-like country that rose up from before the\nhouse-door–casting too heavy black shadows that seemed far more\nconcrete and solid than the brilliant pale surfaces of the rock slabs or\neven than the diamond flashes from the quartz and crystal that here and\nthere sparkled up the stony pathway. Compared with this clear splendour,\nthe yellow light from the shuttered house seemed a hot and tawdry thing;\nand the priest, leaning against the door-post, his eyes alone alight in\nhis dark face, sank down at last with a kind of Eastern sensuousness to\nbathe himself in the glory, and to spread his lean, brown hands out to\nit.",
        "This was a very simple man, in faith as well as in life. For him there\nwere neither the ecstasies nor the desolations of his master. It was an\nimmense and solemn joy to him to live here at the spot of God’s\nIncarnation and in attendance upon His Vicar. As regarded the movements\nof the world, he observed them as a man in a ship watches the heaving of\nthe waves far beneath. Of course the world was restless, he half\nperceived, for, as the Latin Doctor had said, all hearts were restless\nuntil they found their rest in God. Quare fremuerunt gentes?...\nAdversus Dominum, et adversus Christum ejus! As to the end–he was not\ngreatly concerned. It might well be that the ship would be overwhelmed,\nbut the moment of the catastrophe would be the end of all things\nearthly. The gates of hell shall not prevail: when Rome falls, the world\nfalls; and when the world falls, Christ is manifest in power. For\nhimself, he imagined that the end was not far away. When he had named\nMegiddo this afternoon it had been in his mind; to him it seemed natural\nthat at the consummation of all things Christ’s Vicar should dwell at\nNazareth where His King had come on earth–and that the Armageddon of\nthe Divine John should be within sight of the scene where Christ had\nfirst taken His earthly sceptre and should take it again. After all, it\nwould not be the first battle that Megiddo had seen. Israel and Amalek\nhad met here; Israel and Assyria; Sesostris had ridden here and\nSennacherib. Christian and Turk had contended here, like Michael and\nSatan, over the place where God’s Body had lain. As to the exact method\nof that end, he had no clear views; it would be a battle of some kind,\nand what field could be found more evidently designed for that than this\nhuge flat circular plain of Esdraelon, twenty miles across, sufficient\nto hold all the armies of the earth in its embrace? To his view once\nmore, ignorant as he was of present statistics, the world was divided\ninto two large sections, Christians and heathens, and he supposed them\nvery much of a size. Something would happen, troops would land at\nKhaifa, they would stream southwards from Tiberias, Damascus and remote\nAsia, northwards from Jerusalem, Egypt and Africa; eastwards from\nEurope; westwards from Asia again and the far-off Americas. And, surely,\nthe time could not be far away, for here was Christ’s Vicar; and, as He\nHimself had said in His gospel of the Advent, Ubicumque fuerit corpus,\nillie congregabuntur et aquilae. Of more subtle interpretations of\nprophecy he had no knowledge. For him words were things, not merely\nlabels upon ideas. What Christ and St. Paul and St. John had said–these\nthings were so. He had escaped, owing chiefly to his isolation from the\nworld, that vast expansion of Ritschlian ideas that during the last\ncentury had been responsible for the desertion by so many of any\nintelligible creed. For others this had been the supreme struggle–the\ndifficulty of decision between the facts that words were not things, and\nyet that the things they represented were in themselves objective. But\nto this man, sitting now in the moonlight, listening to the far-off tap\nof hoofs over the hill as the messenger came up from Cana, faith was as\nsimple as an exact science. Here Gabriel had descended on wide feathered\nwings from the Throne of God set beyond the stars, the Holy Ghost had\nbreathed in a beam of ineffable light, the Word had become Flesh as Mary\nfolded her arms and bowed her head to the decree of the Eternal. And\nhere once more, he thought, though it was no more than a guess–yet he\nthought that already the running of chariot-wheels was audible–the\ntumult of the hosts of God gathering about the camp of the saints–he\nthought that already beyond the bars of the dark Gabriel set to his lips\nthe trumpet of doom and heaven was astir. He might be wrong at this\ntime, as others had been wrong at other times, but neither he nor they\ncould be wrong for ever; there must some day be an end to the patience\nof God, even though that patience sprang from the eternity of His\nnature. He stood up, as down the pale moonlit path a hundred yards away\ncame a pale figure of one who rode, with a leather bag strapped to his\ngirdle.",
