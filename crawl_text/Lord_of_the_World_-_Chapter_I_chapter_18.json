        "Oliver Brand was seated at his desk, on the evening of the next day,\nreading the leading article of the New People, evening edition.",
        "“We have had time,” he read, “to recover ourselves a little from the\nintoxication of last night. Before embarking on prophecy, it will be as\nwell to recall the facts. Up to yesterday evening our anxiety with\nregard to the Eastern crisis continued; and when twenty-one o’clock\nstruck there were not more than forty persons in London–the English\ndelegates, that is to say–who knew positively that the danger was over.\nBetween that moment and half-an-hour later the Government took a few\ndiscreet steps: a select number of persons were informed; the police\nwere called out, with half-a-dozen regiments, to preserve order; Paul’s\nHouse was cleared; the railroad companies were warned; and at the half\nhour precisely the announcement was made by means of the electric\nplacards in every quarter of London, as well as in all large provincial\ntowns. We have not space now to adequately describe the admirable manner\nin which the public authorities did their duty; it is enough to say that\nnot more than seventy fatalities took place in the whole of London; nor\nis it our business to criticise the action of the Government, in\nchoosing this mode of making the announcement.",
        "“By twenty-two o’clock Paul’s House was filled in every corner, the Old\nChoir was reserved for members of Parliament and public officials, the\nquarter-dome galleries were filled with ladies, and to the rest of the\nfloor the public was freely admitted. The volor-police also inform us\nnow that for about the distance of one mile in every direction round\nthis centre every thoroughfare was blocked with pedestrians, and, two\nhours later, as we all know, practically all the main streets of the\nwhole of London were in the same condition.",
        "“It was an excellent choice by which Mr. OLIVER BRAND was selected as\nthe first speaker. His arm was still in bandages; and the appeal of his\nfigure as well as his passionate words struck the first explicit note of\nthe evening. A report of his words will be found in another column. In\ntheir turns, the PRIME MINISTER, Mr. SNOWFORD, the FIRST MINISTER OF THE\nADMIRALTY, THE SECRETARY FOR EASTERN AFFAIRS, and LORD PEMBERTON, all\nspoke a few words, corroborating the extraordinary news. At a quarter\nbefore twenty-three, the noise of cheering outside announced the arrival\nof the American delegates from Paris, and one by one these ascended the\nplatform by the south gates of the Old Choir. Each spoke in turn. It is\nimpossible to appreciate words spoken at such a moment as this; but\nperhaps it is not invidious to name Mr. MARKHAM as the orator who above\nall others appealed to those who were privileged to hear him. It was he,\ntoo, who told us explicitly what others had merely mentioned, to the\neffect that the success of the American efforts was entirely due to Mr.\nJULIAN FELSENBURGH. As yet Mr. FELSENBURGH had not arrived; but in\nanswer to a roar of inquiry, Mr. MARKHAM announced that this gentleman\nwould be amongst them in a few minutes. He then proceeded to describe to\nus, so far as was possible in a few sentences, the methods by which Mr.\nFELSENBURGH had accomplished what is probably the most astonishing task\nknown to history. It seems from his words that Mr. FELSENBURGH (whose\nbiography, so far as it is known, we give in another column) is probably\nthe greatest orator that the world has ever known–we use these words\ndeliberately. All languages seem the same to him; he delivered speeches\nduring the eight months through which the Eastern Convention lasted, in\nno less than fifteen tongues. Of his manner in speaking we shall have a\nfew remarks to make presently. He showed also, Mr. MARKHAM told us, the\nmost astonishing knowledge, not only of human nature, but of every trait\nunder which that divine thing manifests itself. He appeared acquainted\nwith the history, the prejudices, the fears, the hopes, the expectations\nof all the innumerable sects and castes of the East to whom it was his\nbusiness to speak. In fact, as Mr. MARKHAM said, he is probably the\nfirst perfect product of that new cosmopolitan creation to which the\nworld has laboured throughout its history. In no less than nine\nplaces–Damascus, Irkutsk, Constantinople, Calcutta, Benares, Nanking,\namong them–he was hailed as Messiah by a Mohammedan mob. Finally, in\nAmerica, where this extraordinary figure has arisen, all speak well of\nhim. He has been guilty of none of those crimes–there is not one that\nconvicts him of sin–those crimes of the Yellow Press, of corruption, of\ncommercial or political bullying which have so stained the past of all\nthose old politicians who made the sister continent what she has become.\nMr. FELSENBURGH has not even formed a party. He, and not his underlings,\nhave conquered. Those who were present in Paul’s House on this occasion\nwill understand us when we say that the effect of those words was\nindescribable.",
        "“When Mr. MARKHAM sat down, there was a silence; then, in order to quiet\nthe rising excitement, the organist struck the first chords of the\nMasonic Hymn; the words were taken up, and presently not only the whole\ninterior of the building rang with it, but outside, too, the people\nresponded, and the city of London for a few moments became indeed a\ntemple of the Lord.",
        "“Now indeed we come to the most difficult part of our task, and it is\nbetter to confess at once that anything resembling journalistic\ndescriptiveness must be resolutely laid aside. The greatest things are\nbest told in the simplest words.",
        "“Towards the close of the fourth verse, a figure in a plain dark suit\nwas observed ascending the steps of the platform. For a moment this\nattracted no attention, but when it was seen that a sudden movement had\nbroken out among the delegates, the singing began to falter; and it\nceased altogether as the figure, after a slight inclination to right and\nleft, passed up the further steps that led to the rostrum. Then occurred\na curious incident. The organist aloft at first did not seem to\nunderstand, and continued playing, but a sound broke out from the crowd\nresembling a kind of groan, and instantly he ceased. But no cheering\nfollowed. Instead a profound silence dominated in an instant the huge\nthrong; this, by some strange magnetism, communicated itself to those\nwithout the building, and when Mr. FELSENBURGH uttered his first words,\nit was in a stillness that was like a living thing. We leave the\nexplanation of this phenomenon to the expert in psychology.",
        "“Of his actual words we have nothing to say. So far as we are aware no\nreporter made notes at the moment; but the speech, delivered in\nEsperanto, was a very simple one, and very short. It consisted of a\nbrief announcement of the great fact of Universal Brotherhood, a\ncongratulation to all who were yet alive to witness this consummation of\nhistory; and, at the end, an ascription of praise to that Spirit of the\nWorld whose incarnation was now accomplished.",
        "“So much we can say; but we can say nothing as to the impression of the\npersonality who stood there. In appearance the man seemed to be about\nthirty-three years of age, clean-shaven, upright, with white hair and\ndark eyes and brows; he stood motionless with his hands on the rail, he\nmade but one gesture that drew a kind of sob from the crowd, he spoke\nthese words slowly, distinctly, and in a clear voice; then he stood\nwaiting.",
        "“There was no response but a sigh which sounded in the ears of at least\none who heard it as if the whole world drew breath for the first time;\nand then that strange heart-shaking silence fell again. Many were\nweeping silently, the lips of thousands moved without a sound, and all\nfaces were turned to that simple figure, as if the hope of every soul\nwere centred there. So, if we may believe it, the eyes of many,\ncenturies ago, were turned on one known now to history as JESUS OF\nNAZARETH.",
        "“Mr. FELSENBURGH stood so a moment longer, then he turned down the\nsteps, passed across the platform and disappeared.",
        "“Of what took place outside we have received the following account from\nan eye-witness. The white volor, so well known now to all who were in\nLondon that night, had remained stationary outside the little south door\nof the Old Choir aisle, poised about twenty feet above the ground.\nGradually it became known to the crowd, in those few minutes, who it was\nwho had arrived in it, and upon Mr. FELSENBURGH’S reappearance that same\nstrange groan sounded through the whole length of Paul’s Churchyard,\nfollowed by the same silence. The volor descended; the master stepped on\nboard, and once more the vessel rose to a height of twenty feet. It was\nthought at first that some speech would be made, but none was necessary;\nand after a moment’s pause, the volor began that wonderful parade which\nLondon will never forget. Four times during the night Mr. FELSENBURGH\nwent round the enormous metropolis, speaking no word; and everywhere the\ngroan preceded and followed him, while silence accompanied his actual\npassage. Two hours after sunrise the white ship rose over Hampstead and\ndisappeared towards the North; and since then he, whom we call, in\ntruth, the Saviour of the world, has not been seen.",
        "“And now what remains to be said?",
        "“Comment is useless. It is enough to say in one short sentence that the\nnew era has begun, to which prophets and kings, and the suffering, the\ndying, all who labour and are heavy-laden, have aspired in vain. Not\nonly has intercontinental rivalry ceased to exist, but the strife of\nhome dissensions has ceased also. Of him who has been the herald of its\ninauguration we have nothing more to say. Time alone can show what is\nyet left for him to do.",
        "“But what has been done is as follows. The Eastern peril has been for\never dissipated. It is understood now, by fanatic barbarians as well as\nby civilised nations, that the reign of War is ended. ’Not peace but a\nsword,’ said CHRIST; and bitterly true have those words proved to be.\n’Not a sword but peace’ is the retort, articulate at last, from those\nwho have renounced CHRIST’S claims or have never accepted them. The\nprinciple of love and union learned however falteringly in the West\nduring the last century, has been taken up in the East as well. There\nshall be no more an appeal to arms, but to justice; no longer a crying\nafter a God Who hides Himself, but to Man who has learned his own\nDivinity. The Supernatural is dead; rather, we know now that it never\nyet has been alive. What remains is to work out this new lesson, to\nbring every action, word and thought to the bar of Love and Justice; and\nthis will be, no doubt, the task of years. Every code must be reversed;\nevery barrier thrown down; party must unite with party, country with\ncountry, and continent with continent. There is no longer the fear of\nfear, the dread of the hereafter, or the paralysis of strife. Man has\ngroaned long enough in the travails of birth; his blood has been poured\nout like water through his own foolishness; but at length he understands\nhimself and is at peace.",
        "“Let it be seen at least that England is not behind the nations in this\nwork of reformation; let no national isolation, pride of race, or\ndrunkenness of wealth hold her hands back from this enormous work. The\nresponsibility is incalculable, but the victory certain. Let us go\nsoftly, humbled by the knowledge of our crimes in the past, confident in\nthe hope of our achievements in the future, towards that reward which is\nin sight at last–the reward hidden so long by the selfishness of men,\nthe darkness of religion, and the strife of tongues–the reward promised\nby one who knew not what he said and denied what he asserted–Blessed\nare the meek, the peacemakers, the merciful, for they shall inherit the\nearth, be named the children of God, and find mercy.”",
        "Oliver, white to the lips, with his wife kneeling now beside him, turned\nthe page and read one more short paragraph, marked as being the latest\nnews.",
        "“It is understood that the Government is in communication with Mr.\nFelsenburgh.”",
