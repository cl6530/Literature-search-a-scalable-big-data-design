        "That night there was sleep under Hiram Ranger’s roof for Mary the cook\nonly. Of the four wakeful ones the most unhappy was Hiram himself, the\nprecipitator of it all. Arthur had the consolation of his conviction that\nhis calamity was unjust; Adelaide and her mother, of their conviction\nthat in the end it could not but be well with Arthur. For Hiram there was\nno consolation. He reviewed and re-reviewed the facts, and each time he\nreached again his original conclusion; the one course in repairing the\nmistakes of the boy’s bringing up was a sharp rightabout. “Don’t waste no\ntime gettin’ off the wrong road, once you’re sure it’s wrong,” had been a\nmaxim of his father, and he had found it a rule with no exceptions. He\nappreciated that there is a better way from the wrong road into the right\nthan a mad dash straight across the stumpy fields and rocky gullies\nbetween. That rough, rude way, however, was the single way open to him\nhere. Whenever it had become necessary for him to be firm with those he\nloved, it had rarely been possible for him to do right in the right way;\nhe had usually been forced to do right in the wrong way–to hide himself\nfrom them behind a manner of cold and silent finality, and, so, to\nprevent them from forming an alliance and a junction of forces with the\ntraitor softness within him. Besides, gentle, roundabout, gradual\nmeasures would require time–delay; and he must “put his house in order\"\nforthwith.",
        "Thus, even the consolation that he was at least doing right was denied\nhim. As he lay there he could see himself harshly forcing the bitter\nmedicine upon his son, the cure for a disease for which he was himself\nresponsible; he could see his son’s look and could not deny its justice.\n“I reckon he hates me,” thought Hiram, pouring vitriol into his own\nwounds, “and I reckon he’s got good cause to.”",
        "But there was in the old miller a Covenanter fiber tough as ironwood.\nThe idea of yielding did not enter his head. He accepted his sufferings\nas part of his punishment for past indulgence and weakness; he would\nendure, and go forward. His wife understood him by a kind of intuition\nwhich, like most of our insight into the true natures of those close\nabout us, was a gradual permeation from the one to the other rather than\nclear, deliberate reasoning. But the next morning her sore and anxious\nmother’s heart misread the gloom of his strong face into sternness\ntoward her only son.",
        "“When did you allow to put the boy to work, father?” she finally said,\nand her tone unintentionally made Hiram feel more than ever as if he had\nsentenced “the boy” to hard labor in the degradation and disgrace of a\nchain gang.",
        "As he waited some time for self-control before answering, she thought her\ninquiry had deepened his resentment. “Not that I don’t think you’re\nright, maybe,” she hastened to add, “though\"–this wistfully, in a\nfeminine and maternal subtlety of laying the first lines for sapping and\nmining his position–\"I often think about our life, all work and no play,\nand wonder if we oughtn’t to give the children the chance we never had.”",
        "“No good never came of idleness,” said Hiram, uncompromisingly, “and to\nbe busy about foolishness is still worse. Work or rot–that’s life.”",
        "“That’s so; that’s so,” she conceded. And she was sincere; for that was\nher real belief, and what she had hinted was a mere unthinking repetition\nof the shallow, comfortable philosophy of most people–those “go easys\"\nand “do nothings” and “get nowheres” wherewith Saint X and the\nsurrounding country were burdened. “Still,” she went on, aloud, “Arthur\nhasn’t got any bad habits, like most of the young men round here with\nmore money than’s good for them.”",
        "“Drink ain’t the only bad habit,” replied Hiram. “It ain’t the worst,\nthough it looks the worst. The boy’s got brains. It ain’t right to allow\nhim to choke ’em up with nonsense.”",
        "Ellen’s expression was assent.",
        "“Tell him to come down to the mill next Monday,” said Hiram, after\nanother silence, “and tell him to get some clothes that won’t look\nridiculous.” He paused, then added; “A man that ain’t ready to do\nanything, no matter what so long as it’s useful and honest, is good\nfor nothing.”",
        "The night had bred in Arthur brave and bold resolves. He would not tamely\nsubmit; he would cast his father off, would go forth and speedily carve a\nbrilliant career. He would show his father that, even if the training of\na gentleman develops tastes above the coarseness of commerce, it also\ndevelops the mental superiority that makes fleeing chaff of the obstacles\nto fame and wealth. He did not go far into details; but, as his essays at\nHarvard had been praised, he thought of giving literature’s road to\ndistinction the preference over the several others that must be smooth\nbefore him. Daylight put these imaginings into silly countenance, and he\nfelt silly for having lingered in their company, even in the dark. As he\ndressed he had much less than his wonted content with himself. He did not\ntake the same satisfaction in his clothes, as evidence of his good taste,\nor in his admired variations of the fashion of wearing the hair and tying\nthe scarf. Midway in the process of arranging his hair he put down his\nmilitary brushes; leaning against the dressing table, he fixed his mind\nupon the first serious thoughts he had ever had in his whole\nirresponsible, sheltered life. “Well,” he said, half-aloud, “there issomething wrong! If there isn’t, why do I feel as if my spine had\ncollapsed?” After a long pause, he added: “And it has! All that held it\nsteady was father’s hand.”",
        "The whole lofty and beautiful structure of self-complacence upon which\nhe had lounged, preening his feathers and receiving social triumphs and\nthe adulation of his “less fortunate fellows” as the due of his own\npersonal superiority, suddenly slipped from under him. With a rueful\nsmile at his plight, he said: “The governor has called me down.” Then,\nresentfully, and with a return of his mood of dignity outraged and pride\ntrampled upon: “But he had no right to put me up there–or let me climb\nup there.” Once a wrong becomes “vested,” it is a “vested right,” sacred,\ntaboo. Arthur felt that his father was committing a crime against him.",
        "When he saw Adelaide and his mother their anxious looks made him furious.\nSo! They knew how helpless he was; they were pitying him. Pitying him!\nPitying him! He just tasted his coffee; with scowling brow he hastened\nto the stables for his saddle horse and rode away alone. “Wait a few\nminutes and I’ll come with you,” called Adelaide from the porch as he\ngalloped by. He pretended not to hear. When clear of the town he “took it\nout” on his horse, using whip and spur until it gripped the bit and ran\naway. He fought savagely with it; at a turn in the road it slipped and\nfell, all but carrying him under. He was in such a frenzy that if he had\nhad a pistol he would have shot it. The chemical action of his crisis\nprecipitated in a black mass all the poison his nature had been absorbing\nin those selfish, supercilious years. So long as that poison was held in\nsuspense it was imperceptible to himself as well as to others. But now,\nthere it was, unmistakably a poison. At the sight his anger vanished.\n“I’m a beast!” he ejaculated, astonished. “And here I’ve been imagining I\nwas a fairly decent sort of fellow. What the devil have I been up to, to\nmake me like this?”",
        "He walked along the road, leading his horse by the bridle slipped over\nhis arm. He resumed his reverie of the earlier morning, and began a\nlittle less dimly to see his situation from the new viewpoint. “I deserve\nwhat I’m getting,” he said to himself. Then, at a twinge from the\nresentment that had gone too deep to be ejected in an instant, he added:\n“But that doesn’t excuse him.” His father was to blame for the whole\nugly business–for his plight within and without. Still, fixing the blame\nwas obviously unimportant beside the problem of the way out. And for that\nproblem he, in saner mood, began to feel that the right solution was to\ndo something and so become in his own person a somebody, instead of being\nmere son of a somebody. “I haven’t got this shock a minute too soon,” he\nreflected. “I must take myself in hand. I–”",
        "“Why, it’s you, Arthur, isn’t it?” startled him.",
        "He looked up, saw Mrs. Whitney coming toward him. She was in a winter\nwalking suit, though the day was warm. She was engaged in the pursuit\nthat was the chief reason for her three months’ retirement to the bluffs\noverlooking Saint X–the preservation of her figure. She hated exercise,\nbeing by nature as lazy, luxurious, and self-indulgent physically as she\nwas alert and industrious mentally. From October to July she ate and\ndrank about what she pleased, never set foot upon the ground if she could\nhelp it, and held her tendency to hips in check by daily massage. From\nJuly to October she walked two or three hours a day, heavily dressed, and\nhad a woman especially to attend to her hair and complexion, in addition\nto the masseuse toiling to keep her cheeks and throat firm for the\nfight against wrinkles and loss of contour.",
        "Arthur frowned at the interruption, then smoothed his features into a\ncordial smile; and at once that ugly mass of precipitated poison began to\nredistribute itself and hide itself from him.",
        "“You’ve had a fall, haven’t you?”",
        "He flushed. She, judging with the supersensitive vanity of all her\nself-conscious “set,” thought the flush was at the implied criticism of\nhis skill; but he was far too good a rider to care about his\nmisadventure, and it was her unconscious double meaning that stung him.\nShe turned; they walked together. After a brief debate as to the time for\nconfessing his “fall,” which, at best, could remain a secret no longer\nthan Monday, he chose the present. “Father’s begun to cut up rough,” said\nhe, and his manner was excellent. “He’s taken away my allowance, and I’m\nto go to work at the mill.” He was yielding to the insidious influence of\nher presence, was dropping rapidly back toward the attitude as well as\nthe accent of “our set.”",
        "At his frank disclosure Mrs. Whitney congratulated herself on her\nshrewdness so heartily that she betrayed it in her face; but Arthur did\nnot see. “I suppose your mother can do nothing with him.” This was spoken\nin a tone of conviction. She always felt that, if she had had Hiram to\ndeal with, she would have been fully as successful with him as she\nthought she had been with Charles Whitney. She did not appreciate the\nfundamental difference in the characters of the two men. Both were iron\nof will; but there was in Whitney–and not in Hiram–a selfishness that\ntook the form of absolute indifference to anything and everything which\ndid not directly concern himself–his business or his physical comfort.\nThus his wife had had her way in all matters of the social career, and he\nwould have forced upon her the whole responsibility for the children if\nshe had not spared him the necessity by assuming it. He cheerfully paid\nthe bills, no matter what they were, because he thought his money’s power\nto buy him immunity from family annoyances one of its chief values. She,\nand everyone else, thought she ruled him; in fact, she not only did not\nrule him, but had not even influence with him in the smallest trifle of\nthe matters he regarded as important.",
        "The last time he had looked carefully at her–many, many years before–he\nhad thought her beautiful; he assumed thenceforth that she was still\nbeautiful, and was therefore proud of her. In like manner he had made up\nhis mind favorably to his children. As the bills grew heavier and\nheavier, from year to year, with the wife and two children assiduously\nexpanding them, he paid none the less cheerfully. “There is some\nsatisfaction in paying up for them,” reflected he. “At least a man can\nfeel that he’s getting his money’s worth.” And he contrasted his luck\nwith the bad luck of so many men who had to “pay up” for “homely frumps,\nthat look worse the more they spend.”",
        "But Arthur was replying to Mrs. Whitney’s remark with a bitter “Nobody\ncan do anything with father; he’s narrow and obstinate. If you argue with\nhim, he’s silent. He cares for nothing but his business.”",
        "Arthur did not hesitate to speak thus frankly to Mrs. Whitney. She seemed\na member of the family, like a sister of his mother or father who had\nlived with them always; also he accepted her at the valuation she and all\nher friends set upon her–he, like herself and them, thought her generous\nand unselfish because she was lavish with sympathetic words and with\nalms–the familiar means by which the heartless cheat themselves into a\nreputation for heart. She always left the objects of her benevolence the\npoorer for her ministrations, though they did not realize it. She adopted\nas the guiding principle of her life the cynical philosophy–\"Give people\nwhat they want, never what they need.” By sympathizing effusively with\nthose in trouble, she encouraged them in low-spiritedness; by lavishing\nalms, she weakened struggling poverty into pauperism. But she took away\nand left behind enthusiasm for her own moral superiority and humanity.\nAlso she deceived herself and others with such fluid outpourings of fine\nphrases about “higher life” and “spiritual thinking” as so exasperated\nHiram Ranger.",
        "Now, instead of showing Arthur what her substratum of shrewd sense\nenabled her to see, she ministered soothingly unto his vanity. His father\nwas altogether wrong, tyrannical, cruel; he himself was altogether right,\na victim of his father’s ignorance of the world.",
        "“I decided not to submit,” said Arthur, as if the decision were one which\nhad come to him the instant his father had shown the teeth and claws of\ntyranny, instead of being an impulse of just that moment, inspired by\nMrs. Whitney’s encouragement to the weakest and worst in his nature.",
        "“I shouldn’t be too hasty about that,” she cautioned. “He is old and\nsick. You ought to be more than considerate. And, also, you should\nbe careful not to make him do anything that would cut you out of\nyour rights.”",
        "It was the first time the thought of his “rights\"–of the share of his\nfather’s estate that would be his when his father was no more–had\ndefinitely entered his head. That he would some day be a rich man he had\naccepted just as he accepted the other conditions of his environment–all\nto which he was born and in which consisted his title to be regarded as\nof the “upper classes,” like his associates at Harvard. Thinking now on\nthe insinuated proposition that his father might disinherit him, he\npromptly rejected it. “No danger of his doing that,” he assured her, with\nthe utmost confidence. “Father is an honest man, and he wouldn’t think of\nanything so dishonest, so dishonorable.”",
        "This view of a child’s rights in the estate of its parents amused Mrs.\nWhitney. She knew how quickly she would herself cut off a child of hers\nwho was obstinately disobedient, and, while she felt that it would be an\noutrage for Hiram Ranger to cut off his son for making what she regarded\nas the beginning of the highest career, the career of “gentleman,” still\nshe could not dispute his right to do so. “Your father may not see your\nrights in the same light that you do, Arthur,” said she mildly. “If I\nwere you, I’d be careful.”",
        "Arthur reflected. “I don’t think it’s possible,” said he, “but I guess\nyou’re right. I must not forget that I’ve got others to think of\nbesides myself.”",
        "This patently meant Janet; Mrs. Whitney held her discreet tongue.",
        "“It will do no harm to go to the office,” she presently continued. “You\nought to get some knowledge of business, anyhow. You will be a man of\nproperty some day, and you will need to know enough about business to be\nable to supervise the managers of your estate. You know, I had Janet take\na course at a business college, last winter, and Ross is in with his\nfather and will be active for several years.”",
        "Thus it came about that on Monday morning at nine Arthur sauntered into\nthe offices of the mills. He was in much such a tumult of anger,\ncuriosity, stubbornness, and nervousness as agitates a child on its\nfirst appearance at school; but in his struggle not to show his feelings\nhe exaggerated his pose into a seeming of bored indifference. The door of\nhis father’s private room was open; there sat Hiram, absorbed in\ndictating to a stenographer. When his son appeared in the doorway, he\napparently did not realize it, though in fact the agitation the young man\nwas concealing under that unfortunate manner was calmness itself in\ncomparison with the state of mind behind Hiram’s mask of somber\nstolidity.",
        "“He’s trying to humiliate me to the depths,” thought the son, as he stood\nand waited, not daring either to advance or to retreat. How could he know\nthat his father was shrinking as a criminal from the branding iron, that\nevery nerve in that huge, powerful, seemingly impassive body was in\ntorture from this ordeal of accepting the hatred of his son in order that\nhe might do what he considered to be his duty? At length the young man\nsaid: “I’m here, father.”",
        "“Be seated–just a minute,” said the father, turning his face toward his\nboy but unable to look even in that direction.",
        "The letter was finished, and the stenographer gathered up her notes and\nwithdrew. Hiram sat nerving himself, his distress accentuating the stern\nstrength of his features. Presently he said: “I see you haven’t come\ndressed for work.”",
        "“Oh, I think these clothes will do for the office,” said Arthur, with\napparent carelessness.",
        "“But this business isn’t run from the office,” replied Hiram, with a\ngentle smile that to the young man looked like the sneer of a tyrant.\n“It’s run from the mill. It prospers–it always has prospered–because\nI work with the men. I know what they ought to do and what they are\ndoing. We all work together here. There ain’t a Sunday clothes job\nabout the place.”",
        "Arthur’s fingers were trembling as he pulled at his small mustache. What\ndid this tyrant expect of him? He had assumed that a place was to be made\nfor him in the office, a dignified place. There he would master the\nbusiness, would gather such knowledge as might be necessary successfully\nto direct it, and would bestow that knowledge in the humble,\nout-of-the-way corner of his mind befitting matters of that kind. And\nhere was his father, believing that the same coarse and toilsome methods\nwhich had been necessary for himself were necessary for a trained and\ncultured understanding!",
        "“What do you want me to do?” asked Arthur.",
        "Hiram drew a breath of relief. The boy was going to show good sense and\nwillingness after all. “I guess you’d better learn barrel-making first,\"\nsaid he. He rose. “I’ll take you to the foreman of the cooperage, and\nto-morrow you can go to work in the stave department. The first thing is\nto learn to make a first-class barrel.”",
        "Arthur slowly rose to follow. He was weak with helpless rage. If his\nfather had taken him into the office and had invited him to help in\ndirecting the intellectual part of that great enterprise, the part that\nin a way was not without appeal to the imagination, he felt that he might\ngradually have accustomed himself to it; but to be put into the mindless\nroutine of the workingman, to be set about menial tasks which a mere\nmuscular machine could perform better than he–what waste, what\ndegradation, what insult!",
        "He followed his father to the cooperage, the uproar of its machinery\njarring fiercely upon him, but not so fiercely as did the common-looking\nmen slaving in torn and patched and stained clothing. He did not look at\nthe foreman as his father was introducing them and ignored his proffered\nhand. “Begin him at the bottom, Patrick,” explained Hiram, “and show him\nno favors. We must give him a good education.”",
        "“That’s right, Mr. Ranger,” said Patrick, eying his new pupil dubiously.\nHe was not skilled in analysis of manner and character, so Arthur’s\nsuperciliousness missed him entirely and he was attributing the cold and\nvacant stare to stupidity. “A regular damn dude,” he was saying to\nhimself. “As soon as the old man’s gone, some fellow with brains’ll do\nhim out of the business. If the old man’s wise, he’ll buy him an annuity,\nsomething safe and sure. Why do so many rich people have sons like that?\nIf I had one of his breed I’d shake his brains up with a stave.”",
        "Arthur mechanically followed his father back to the office. At the door\nHiram, eager to be rid of him, said: “I reckon that’s about all we can do\nto-day. You’d better go to Black and Peters’s and get you some clothes.\nThen you can show up at the cooperage at seven to-morrow morning, ready\nto put in a good day’s work.”",
        "He laid his hand on his son’s shoulder, and that gesture and the\naccompanying look, such as a surgeon might give his own child upon whom\nhe was performing a cruelly painful operation, must have caused some part\nof what he felt to penetrate to the young man; for, instead of bursting\nout at his father, he said appealingly: “Would it be a very great\ndisappointment to you if I were to go into–into some–some other line?”",
        "“What line?” asked Hiram.",
        "“I haven’t settled–definitely. But I’m sure I’m not fitted for this.” He\nchecked himself from going on to explain that he thought it would mean a\nwaste of all the refinements and elegancies he had been at so much pains\nto acquire.",
        "“Who’s to look after the business when I’m gone?” asked Hiram. “Most of\nwhat we’ve got is invested here. Who’s to look after your mother’s and\nsister’s interests, not to speak of your own?”",
        "“I’d be willing to devote enough time to it to learn the management,\"\nsaid Arthur, “but I don’t care to know all the details.”",
        "It was proof of Hiram’s great love for the boy that he had no impulse of\nanger at this display of what seemed to him the most priggish ignorance.\n“There’s only one way to learn,” said he quietly. “That’s the way I’ve\nmarked out for you. Don’t forget–we start up at seven. You can breakfast\nwith me at a quarter past six, and we’ll come down together.”",
        "As Arthur walked homeward he pictured himself in jumper and overalls on\nhis way from work of an evening–meeting the Whitneys–meeting Janet\nWhitney! Like all Americans, who become inoculated with “grand ideas,\"\nhe had the super-sensitiveness to appearances that makes foreigners call\nus the most snobbishly conventional people on earth. What would it avail\nto be in character the refined person in the community and in position\nthe admired person, if he spent his days at menial toil and wore the\nlivery of labor? He knew Janet Whitney would blush as she bowed to him,\nand that she wouldn’t bow to him unless she were compelled to do so\nbecause she had not seen him in time to escape; and he felt that she\nwould be justified. The whole business seemed to him a hideous dream, a\nsardonic practical joke upon him. Surely, surely, he would presently wake\nfrom this nightmare to find himself once more an unimperiled gentleman.",
        "In the back parlor at home he found Adelaide about to set out for the\nWhitneys. As she expected to walk with Mrs. Whitney for an hour before\nlunch she was in walking costume–hat, dress, gloves, shoes, stockings,\nsunshade, all the simplest, most expensive-looking, most\nunpractical-looking white. From hat to heels she was the embodiment of\nluxurious, “ladylike\" idleness, the kind that not only is idle itself,\nbut also, being beautiful, attractive, and compelling, is the cause of\nidleness in others. She breathed upon Arthur the delicious perfume of the\nelegant life from which he was being thrust by the coarse hand of his\nfather–and Arthur felt as if he were already in sweaty overalls.",
        "“Well?” she asked.",
        "“He’s going to make a common workman of me,” said Arthur, sullen,\nmentally contrasting his lot with hers. “And he’s got me on the hip. I\ndon’t dare treat him as he deserves. If I did, he’s got just devil enough\nin him to cheat me out of my share of the property. A sweet revenge he\ncould take on me in his will.”",
        "Adelaide drew back–was rudely thrust back by the barrier between her and\nher brother which had sprung up as if by magic. Across it she studied him\nwith a pain in her heart that showed in her face. “O Arthur, how can you\nthink such a thing!” she exclaimed.",
        "“Isn’t it so?” he demanded.",
        "“He has a right to do what he pleases with his own.” Then she softened\nthis by adding, “But he’d never do anything unjust.”",
        "“It isn’t his own,” retorted her brother. “It belongs to us all.”",
        "“We didn’t make it,” she insisted. “We haven’t any right to it, except to\nwhat he gives us.”",
        "“Then you think we’re living on his charity?”",
        "“No–not just that,” she answered hesitatingly. “I’ve never thought it\nout–never have thought about it at all.”",
        "“He brought us into the world,” Arthur pursued. “He has accustomed us to\na certain station–to a certain way of living. It’s his duty in honesty\nand in honor to do everything in his power to keep us there.”",
        "Del admitted to herself that this was plausible, but she somehow felt\nthat it was not true. “It seems to me that if parents bring their\nchildren up to be the right sort–useful and decent and a credit,” said\nshe, “they’ve done the biggest part of their duty. The money isn’t so\nimportant, is it? At least, it oughtn’t to be.”",
        "Arthur looked at her with angry suspicion. “Suppose he made a will giving\nit all to you, Del,” he said, affecting the manner of impartial,\ndisinterested argument, “what would you do?”",
        "“Share with you, of course,” she answered, hurt that he should raise the\nquestion at a time when raising it seemed an accusation of her, or at\nleast a doubt of her.",
        "He laughed satirically. “That’s what you think now,” said he. “But, when\nthe time came, you’d be married to Ross Whitney, and he’d show you how\njust father’s judgment of me was, how wicked it would be to break his\nlast solemn wish and will, and how unfit I was to take care of money. And\nyou’d see it; and the will would stand. Oh, you’d see it! I know human\nnature. If it was a small estate–in those cases brothers and sisters\nalways act generously–no, not always. Some of ’em, lots of ’em, quarrel\nand fight over a few pieces of furniture and crockery. But in a case of\na big estate, who ever heard of the one that was favored giving up his\nadvantage unless he was afraid of a scandal, or his lawyers advised him\nhe might as well play the generous, because he’d surely lose the suit?”",
        "“Of course, Arthur, I can’t be sure what I’d do,” she replied gently;\n“but I hope I’d not be made altogether contemptible by inheriting a\nlittle money.”",
        "“But it wouldn’t seem contemptible,” he retorted. “It’d be legal and\nsensible, and it’d seem just. You’d only be obeying a dead father’s last\nwishes and guarding the interests of your husband and your children. They\ncome before brothers.”",
        "“But not before self-respect,” she said very quietly. She put her arm\naround his neck and pressed her cheek against his. “Arthur–dear–dear–\"\nshe murmured, “please don’t talk or think about this any more.\nIt–it–hurts.” And there were hot tears in her eyes, and at her heart a\nsense of sickness and of fright; for his presentation of the other side\nof the case made her afraid of what she might do, or be tempted to do, in\nthe circumstances he pictured. She knew she wouldn’t–at least, not so\nlong as she remained the person she then was. But how long would that be?\nHow many years of association with her new sort of friends–with the sort\nRoss had long been–with the sort she was becoming more and more\nlike–how many, or, rather, how few years would it take to complete the\nprocess of making her over into a person who would do precisely what\nArthur had pictured?",
        "Arthur had said a great deal more than he intended–more, even, than he\nbelieved true. For a moment he felt ashamed of himself; then he reminded\nhimself that he wasn’t really to blame; that, but for his father’s\nharshness toward him, he would never have had such sinister thoughts\nabout him or Adelaide. Thus his apology took the form of an outburst\nagainst Hiram. “Father has brought out the worst there is in me!” he\nexclaimed. “He is goading me on to–”",
        "He looked up; Hiram was in the doorway. He sprang to his feet. “Yes, I\nmean it!” he cried, his brain confused, his blood on fire. “I don’t care\nwhat you do. Cut me off! Make me go to work like any common laborer!\nCrush out all the decency there is in me!”",
        "The figure of the huge old man was like a storm-scarred statue. The\ntragedy of his countenance filled his son and daughter with awe and\nterror. Then, slowly, like a statue falling, he stiffly tilted forward,\ncrashed at full length face downward on the floor. He lay as he had\nfallen, breathing heavily, hoarsely.
