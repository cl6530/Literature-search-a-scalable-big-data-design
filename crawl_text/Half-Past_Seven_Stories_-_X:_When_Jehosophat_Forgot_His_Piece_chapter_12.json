        "There was much excitement in the Red Schoolhouse. Examinations were\nover; books laid aside. And the walls re-echoed to thrilling\nsounds,–to happy voices and shuffling feet, to poetry, marches, and\nsongs. They were practising for Commencement, for Closing Day. And at\nhome the parents were busy, too, making white dresses and sashes for\nthe girls, buying new suits for the boys in town, or making some over\nfrom father’s old trousers.",
        "Marmaduke was to take part in the marches and songs, but Jehosophat\nhad to speak a whole piece, all alone too. It was a great honor, no\ndoubt about that, which Jehosophat didn’t appreciate. He thought it a\nbother.",
        "Now their teacher was a patriot and fond of History. All through the\nterm she had told them tales of brave lads who were good and great.\nProbably she wanted them to become good and great, too, and of course\nit was the thing to be. That Jehosophat knew, but it was pretty hard\nwhen one kept forgetting.",
        "So he wasn’t at all sure of himself, but of one thing he wassure,–the stories were lost on Fatty. Try as he would he never could\nthink of him as being “good and great,” or exactly “a hero.”",
        "But that was the least of Jehosophat’s worries. He had been given a\npiece to learn–to recite before a big crowd!",
        "It was poetry–all about a boy who had stuck by his ship and gone down\nwith it, too. The piece was called by the boy’s name–a queer sort of\nword–Casabianca. If the piece was as hard as its name, Jehosophat\nthought he never would learn it.",
        "“Well, Jehosophat,” said his father that night, “how’s the orator?”",
        "But Mother said,–",
        "“Don’t tease him, Will, I’m sure he’ll do us proud.”",
        "Jehosophat squirmed in his seat. He didn’t want to “do anyone proud.\"\nThat was not his ambition. And he squirmed still more when she asked\nhim,–",
        "“Have you learned it all, Jehosophat?”",
        "He mumbled something that sounded like,–",
        "“Donev’nknownameyet.”",
        "So next day when he came back from school he had to stay in the\nparlour to study it.",
        "After a while–not so long a while, either–he called to Mother,–",
        "“Mother, I think I could learn it a lot better out doors than in this\ndark room.”",
        "“All right, dear,” she said, “if you’re sure you won’t let anything\ndistract you.”",
        "“No, Mother, I promise.” And he went out by the big elm and stood\nunder the Oriole’s nest. “The boy stood on the burning deck Whence all\nbut he had fled.”",
        "That is the way it began and he started:",
        "“The boy stood on the burning deck\"–then he had to stop, for Mr.\nStuck-up, the Turkey, was taking his afternoon parade right near him.\nMr. Stuckup didn’t seem to like that piece at all. Neither did\nJehosophat, for that matter.",
        "“’The boy’\"–he began again.",
        "“Gobble, gobble,” shrieked the Turkey.",
        "“’Stood on the burning–’”",
        "“Gobble, gobble,” again rudely interrupted Mr. Stuckup.",
        "So Jehosophat went around to the side of the house by the Lilac Bush.\nHe stood up straight and tried it all over again.",
        "“’The boy stood on the burning deck’–get down, get down!” he\nyelled. Now that was strange. It sounded as if he were telling the boy\nto get down off that deck. But it was only Wienerwurst he was talking\nto. For, when he made that fine gesture which Teacher had shown them,\nWienerwurst, who had crept up behind him, thought his master was\nplaying some game, and jumped up at his outstretched fingers.",
        "So once more Jehosophat picked up his reader, and walked over to the\nCrying Tree, whose green willow branches trailed in the Pond.",
        "He practised his fine bow for a while, then began. This time he\nactually got through the first verse all right, and was quite pleased\nwith himself. But no sooner had he stopped than he heard behind him–",
        "A loud",
        "“Hiss! Hiss!”",
        "Now it isn’t pleasant to try to make a good speech, and have some one\nhiss you when they ought to be clapping their hands. But that is just\nwhat The Foolish White Geese were doing to Jehosophat.",
        "Once more he picked up his reader, and marched way up the Brook. He\nhad just begun the lines all over again when Miss Cross Patch the\nGuinea Hen ran out from behind the barn and screeched horribly–just\nas he was making that fine gesture, too.",
        "“Gawke’e!–gawke’e!–gawke’e!”",
        "Now to be called gawky when he thought the gesture was particularly\ngraceful, was indeed discouraging. And, to add to his discomfort, when\nhe tried it again–for the hundredth time, it seemed–the cows in the\npasture stretched their red muzzles over the bars and called:",
        "“Booooooo!”",
        "–just as if they wanted him to stop. And the horses whinnied:",
        "“FUNN-NN-NN-NNY!”",
        "It was no use, so Jehosophat rushed into the house again, stuffed some\ncotton in his ears, and went up in the attic, where he was sure he\nwouldn’t be disturbed.",
        "Here he succeeded pretty well, and had learned two verses, and the\nname–which was quite important–when the supper bell rang. So he felt\nhe had earned that nice glass of creamy milk, and the big slice of\ngingerbread, especially the thick chocolate icing on top. It was an\nextra thick piece, too, which Mother gave him, probably as a prize for\nall his hard work.",
        "Next morning, on the way to school, he was reciting Casabianca for\npractice. He tried it on the Purple Crackles that flew in the fields\nby the blackberry bushes; the little Gold Finches that swayed on the\ngrasses; and the topknotted Kingbirds on the telegraph wires overhead.",
        "And he thought he was getting on pretty well with “The boy stood on\nthe burning deck,” when a voice took the second line right out of his\nmouth:",
        "“Eating peanuts by the peck!!!!!”",
        "Angrily he turned, and there were Fatty Hamm and Reddy Toms, Dicky\nMeans too, and Lizzie Fizzletree, all making faces at him and mocking\nhim with funny gestures. Surely no teacher ever taught gestures like\nthose.",
        "They began it all over again, reciting together. And this is the piece\nthey made of it–you never would have recognized poor Casabianca at\nall:",
        " “The boy stood on the burning deck\n  Eating peanuts by the peck.\n  His father called, he would not go\n  Because he loved his peanuts so!!!”",
        "“Stop,” yelled Jehosophat, “that isn’t it at all.”",
        "“’Tis, too,” shouted Fatty and the others together, and they repeated\nin one breath, as fast as they could:",
        " “’Sfathercalled andewouldn’tgo\n  Causeeloved ’ispeanutsso.”",
        "Yes, every time Jehosophat tried to tell them what it reallywas, they kept shouting in singsong voices, faster and faster:",
        " “Fathercalled ’ewoodengo\n  Causeeloved ’ispeanutsso.”",
        "And every once in a while that little imp Lizzie Fizzletree would make\noutrageous bows, almost down to the ground, in imitation of\nJehosophat.",
        "Next day was the day, the great day. And all the boys\ncame dressed in new suits, or suits made over from Father’s old\ntrousers, with stiff collars, and ties of red, or blue, or brown; and\nthe girls had pretty white dresses with sashes sticking out like\nbutterflies’ wings.",
        "Jehosophat thought they did resemble butterflies until he looked down\nat their feet; and then very crossly he decided that those feet\nspoiled “the effect.” You see, he was getting to use and to\nthink in big words now.",
        "But while he was looking at the regiment of feet, along came Mr.\nHumbleby, the Presidentboardofeducation, and all the County Trustees,\nand the proud parents from near and from far. You could see a long\nline of buggies and surries and carryalls lined against the fence.",
        "Then the signal was given, and the Teacher took her pointer and rose,\nand the scholars smoothed their sashes, or their hair, and rose, too;\nand one and all sang,–",
        "“My country, ’tis of thee.”",
        "Then there were more songs by Theentireschool and pieces by the\nscholars. Lizzie Fizzletree tried one all about flowers. “The Fringed\nGentian,” it was called, and it was very pretty. But when Lizzie got\nthrough with it, Jehosophat didn’t think it was so beautiful. She\nrecited it something like this:",
        "“Dear flo’wr so cal’m and pu’re and bri’ght That op’nest in’ the\nqu’i-et nig’ht.”",
        "And as she recited it she made gestures in all directions, first to\none side, then to the other, just such floppy gestures as Ole Man\nScarecrow would have made. That is, sometimes they looked like that,\nand sometimes her arms looked like the arms of a windmill. And her\nfrizzy pigtails swished around with her arms–just like the sails of a\nwindmill that had suddenly gone mad. The people started to titter, and\nJehosophat started to giggle with them, when suddenly he thought of\nhis own plight, and little shivers ran up and down his back, and his\nface felt very flushed and warm.",
        "Then there were more songs by “Theentireschool\"–and more pieces. My,\nwould they never end! And then there were speeches by the\nPresidentboardeducation and the Trustees, who seemed to appreciate the\nprivilege more than most of the pupils, Jehosophat thought, for they\nnever stopped when they had the chance.",
        "He looked out of the window. Over by the orchard, he could hear a\nflicker go “Rat-a-tat-tat,” boring away at the old apple tree. The sun\nwas shining nice and warm, and he wondered if he couldn’t climb up on\nhis seat, and drop out of the open window, and run away ever so far.\nHe was supposed to “do his parents proud\"; and if there was anything\nhe hated, it was “doing somebody proud.” Oh, golly!",
        "“The boy stood on the burning deck.”",
        "Once or twice he repeated it to himself. Yes, he knew it all right.\nBut just then Fatty Hamm, who sat behind him, leaned over and\nwhispered,–",
        "“Don’t forget the peanuts, Joshy!”",
        "Jehosophat frowned and tried not to pay any attention, but the\nPresidentboardeducation had taken out his spectacles and was reading\nfrom a paper.",
        "“Recitation by––.” He couldn’t seem to understand the name and put\non his glasses a little nearer the end of his nose,",
        "“Recitation by Je-hos-o-phat Green!”",
        "How loud it sounded!",
        "The Presidentboardeducation was looking all over the room.",
        "“Come, come,” he said, ’where is Jehosophat?”",
        "Now that boy couldn’t rise, for the tail of his jacket had slid down\nin the crack of the seat, and Fatty Hamm was holding it tight so he\ncouldn’t even move.",
        "Again the spectacles of the Presidentboardeducation looked over the\nchildren in grave surprise. They lighted on Jehosophat.",
        "“Come, come, my little man, there’s nothing to be afraid of.”",
        "And the Presidentboardeducation smiled on him, with that sort of smile\n“grownups” always put on when they’re going to “do something for your\ngood,” like pulling a tooth, for instance, or offering you castor oil.",
        "There was a drone, too, of voices like the bees outside, and all eyes\nwere looking at him. He didn’t dare look at his mother, who was hoping\nso hard that he would “do her proud,” or at his father, either. But he\ndid glance once at the Toyman, who was sitting, looking very\nuncomfortable, in a boiled shirt and a stiff collar that almost choked\nhis adam’s apple. His hair was slicked down extra tight, too, and he\nkept gazing down into his new store hat. He felt very sorry for\nhimself, and even sorrier for Jehosophat.",
        "But the Presidentboardeducation was saying,–",
        "“Come, come,” again, and then,–",
        "“Tut, tut!”",
        "And all-of-a-sudden Fatty let go of his coat, and Jehosophat found\nhimself on his feet and on his way to the platform.",
        "He wanted to take a little of the glass of water that stood by the\nPresidentboardeducation–just one little sip–for his throat felt so\ndry and his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. But he couldn’t.",
        "He made the fine bow all right, and Mother looked at Father as much as\nto say,–",
        "[Illustration: “But then Jehosophat just had to look at Fatty, and\nFatty had just put a peanut up to his mouth–as a sort of a signal, I\nguess–\"]",
        "“There, I knew our boy could do it.”",
        "And wonderfully he got through the first line,–\"The boy stood on the\nburning deck.”",
        "But then he just had to look at Fatty, and Fatty had just put a peanut\nup to his mouth–as a sort of signal, I guess.",
        "“The boy stood on the burning deck,” repeated Jehosophat, forgetting\nthe next line, and so having to stick to the first. He couldn’t think\nof anything but Fatty’s grinning mouth and that peanut.",
        "“The boy stood on the burning deck,” he called, louder than before.",
        "“The boy stood on the burning deck,” still louder.",
        "“Yes, yes, my little man,” said the Presidentboardeducation, still\nwith that smile that Jehosophat hated so, and before he knew it he was\nshouting right back at the spectacles:–",
        " “Eating peanuts by the peck.\n  His father called ’e wouldngo\n  Causehelovedispeanutsso!”\nYes sir, he shouted the last line oh, so loud, like a little bull,\nright in the Presidentboardeducation’s face. And the\nPresidentboardeducation was so startled that he almost knocked the\npitcher of water off the table. And the teacher’s glasses fell off her\nnose, and she seemed to be unable to find them in her embarrassment–and\nthen–the whole audience roared till the walls of the little Red\nSchoolhouse echoed to their laughter, and Jehosophat saw Fatty slapping\nhis fat legs in delight.",
        "Meanwhile, Jehosophat wasn’t losing any time. He just hurried to the\nwindow, climbed up on the seat, then on the sill, and dropped on the\nsoft grass below, and ran up the road towards home, just as fast as he\ncould travel.",
        "He hadn’t gone far when he heard someone calling,–",
        "“Hey, Sonny!”",
        "He turned with relief.",
        "There was the Toyman, his long legs fast catching up with the runaway.\nAnd the same old smile was on the Toyman’s face.",
        "And when the long legs had caught up with the short ones, the Toyman\nput his arm around the boy’s shoulders, and they walked along\nlike–well, like two old chums.",
        "What was finest, too, was that he never mentioned the cause of\nJehosophat’s trouble and embarrassment, which is what no really true\nfriend ever should do.",
        "At last Jehosophat asked,–",
        "“Where we goin’?”",
        "“Let’s go fishin’–I hate speeches,” the Toyman replied.",
        "“I made a silly, a fool of myself, didn’t I?” said Jehosophat.",
        "“Not by a long sight,” the Toyman replied. “You see, sonny,” he went\non to explain, very soberly, “that’s an old piece of yours and out of\ndate. Now they’re making new arrangements and editions of books and\npo’try all the time. They just change with the times. And yours is a\nheap better than the old piece, anyway you look at it.”",
        "Jehosophat wasn’t quite so sure. But, anyway, they had a great time\n“fishin’.”",
