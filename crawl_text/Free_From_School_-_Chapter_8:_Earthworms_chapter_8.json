        "On the 6th of November, I was put on the Chennai Express, which was to\nleave Dadar Railway station at 7 p.m., by my Uncle Alan who is very\nknowledgeable about trains since he has worked in the railways all his\nworking life. My mum had requested him to check my departure from\nMumbai since Dadar railway station is a crowded and busy place and I\ntoo was not confident of finding my way around. Earlier Grandpapa had\nbrought me to the railway station by cab after making me double-check\nthat I had my ticket, sufficient cash, little tidbits to eat and my\nwater bottle filled for the long journey ahead.",
        "I was to spend one night and the whole of the next day in the train for\nit was due to arrive in Chennai at about 8.30 p.m. on the 7th. Having\ntravelled on a couple of journeys by train during the past few months I\nwas quite relaxed on this one although I continued to be watchful and\ncareful of my things throughout.",
        "The train journey from Mumbai was entirely uneventful. I had a window\nseat and slept the night on the lower berth. Around me was a family of\nmigrant workers who spoke neither Hindi nor English and who were quite\nbusy doing their own things. I did not speak with them nor with anyone\nelse on the journey but contented myself with watching the countryside\nwe passed through and the hustle and bustle at each station, and when I\nwas bored I just went to sleep. I had about Rs.500 with me in cash and\nsome of this was carefully tucked away in different pockets of my\njeans, the balance in various compartments of the haversack. When I\nslept the haversack was my pillow. I also carried a water bottle, some\nsnacks and some fruit which was all I ate during the journey.",
        "The train was delayed by 3 hours and it was well past 11.30 p.m. when\nit arrived at Chennai Central railway station. I was to be met at the\nstation by my parents’ long-time friend K. Manoharan. Uncle Mano and\nAunty Sagu had willingly agreed to look after me during my stay in\nChennai, even though both of them were not keeping good health. Not\nknowing where exactly Uncle Mano would be waiting I walked towards the\nentrance keeping a careful lookout for him. Yet, I failed to recognise\nhim when I saw him for his hair was whiter than when I had seen him\nlast. He recognised me, however, from the bright yellow haversack that\nI carried. He took me home in a rickshaw. I had some food there and\nwent straight off to sleep. Uncle Mano suggested that I relax the next\nday, which I did, watching T.V., looking at photo albums and generally\nchatting with them about my sabbatical so far and about my plans in\nChennai.",
        "Early the following morning Uncle Mano and I set off for New College\nwhere Dr Sultan Ismail’s Earthworm Institute is located and where I\nwould spend the next fortnight studying earthworms and vermiculture.\nActually I had a choice of studying at Dr Bhawalkar’s centre in Pune or\nDr Ismail’s institute in Chennai. But I chose Chennai because I had\nheard Dr Ismail speak at the organic farmers’ convention in Kottayam\nand had liked his talk very much. Another reason of course was that I\nwas dying to get to the Crocodile Bank in Mamallapuram and being in\nChennai which was close to the Croc Bank was infinitely better than\nbeing far away in Pune where Dr Bhawalkar works.",
        "Although Uncle Mano, being a heart patient, does not usually travel by\nbus, he deliberately took me by bus that morning so that I could get to\nknow the route to New College. On the way he pointed out to me various\nlandmarks which would help me know my way around, and gave me general\nbits of advice on how to travel in the city. I had to learn well and\nquickly, for language would be the main problem for me in this city\nwhere I spoke no Tamil.",
        "At the College we met Dr Ismail who took us through the college campus\ndown to the fields where the vermi-pits were and we saw the biogas\nplant, the garbage collection pits, the culture crates and the organic\ncompost now ready for use. I was quite eager to begin and happy when\n“Sir” as everyone calls him, suggested I start work from the next day\nitself.",
        "Every day, except Sundays, for the next 15 days I followed the same\nroutine which was: wake up at 6 a.m or so, eat a hot breakfast of\nidlis, sambar, dosas, vadas or whatever was cooked for breakfast, carry\na hot packed lunch which Aunty Sagu prepared for me and catch a bus by\n7 a.m. from Ashok Pillar to Panagal where I had to change buses and get\non one going to New College. Usually I would land up at the College by\n8.30 a.m. or so and would be at the College till about 3.30 or 4 p.m.,\nafter which the journey would be reversed. These timings helped me to\navoid the office rush both ways. My dad had suggested to Prof Ismail\nthat I be given practical experience and so my programme included a\nmixture of study from books, taking down notes, watching and helping\nthe others and finally making my own vermi-pits.",
        "During the first two days I read up as much as I could about earthworms\nand the world they inhabit from books which were recommended to me by\nDr Ismail. Later I started to observe the different types of\nearthworms, their movements, colour and other characteristics. I also\nlearnt a lot about different types of soils, their textures and nature,\nand was taught how to take soil samples using the tulgren funnel.",
        "There were about 8 to 10 students doing different kinds of research\nunder Dr Ismail and all of us worked in a large room which was formerly\nthe main library. Each one had a separate desk to work and when I came\nI was also given my own desk and chair. The big hall also had a mini\nlibrary on earthworm related books at one end and it was a simple\nmatter therefore to find the books I needed to read.",
        "The main vermi-beds, compost pits and so on were on the ground floor\nbut some of the vermi-beds which were in crates were stacked in the\nnarrow corridor outside the study hall, where we also gathered to eat\nour lunch in the afternoons. Usually any one of the students would\nbriefly guide me in the work that I was assigned for the day after\nwhich I would manage on my own.",
        "During my fortnight stay at the Institute I learnt a lot about\nearthworm environments, including determination of porosity of soil,\nmoisture content and texture. I also observed the other organisms\npresent in the soil and took photos of microarthropods with the help of\na compound microscope. At the end of the course, I practically prepared\na vermi-bed and also ate a few earthworms and cockroaches for\nexperience!",
        "My stay in Chennai was not without its share of adventure. I recall\nthat on my second day, I had entered a bus and rushed for an empty\nseat. I was completely unaware of the procedure, that while in Goa the\nticket collector comes to you and sells you the ticket in the bus, in\nChennai one has to go to the conductor (who is seated at the end of the\nbus) and buy the ticket. So while I waited for the conductor to come on\nhis rounds two inspectors came up to me and caught me for not buying\nthe ticket. One of them started shouting at me in a forceful stream of\nTamil. After much action and hand waving, I explained that I did not\nknow Tamil, that I was from Goa and it was the first time I was\ntravelling in a bus in Chennai. He fined me Rs.25! Fortunately, I had\nenough money on me and paid the fine but when I got down from the bus,\nI found that my empty purse had also been pick-pocketed!",
        "Another time I was on the last step of a bus which I thought would be\nquite okay for I had seen many people travelling while hanging at the\ndoors of crowded buses. However, as this bus started gathering speed I\nfound it very difficult to hold on because the weight of so many people\nbegan to press against me and it felt like I was literally holding\neveryone in with my outstretched arms as I hung practically out of the\ndoor. I resolved never to travel on the footboard, if I could help it,\nagain.",
        "I also got lost several times. But I would never phone for help with\ndirections but would struggle away, walking this side or that, asking\npassers-by till I reached familiar landmarks which would get me home.\nOften I found that I had alighted from the bus a few stops before or\nafter my destination. On one such occasion the next stop was so far\naway that I jumped out of the bus while it slowed down at a traffic\nlight and then spent nearly 30 minutes walking back!",
        "Although Uncle Mano and Aunty Sagu had welcomed me very warmly. Looking\nback, I think I must have given them quite a headache during my stay at\ntheir house because of my rather careless and casual ways and the\nlaid-back lifestyle I had acquired and was thoroughly enjoying. Uncle\nMano would constantly be shouting at me for not having a bath regularly\nor for staying in the bathroom forever when I decided to have a bath or\nfor wearing soiled clothes again instead of washing them.",
        "Aunty Sagu cooks well and I enjoyed her food but both she and Uncle\nMano would notice that I ate much more when there was chicken or fish\nfor dinner rather than vegetarian food and I would get a lecture again\nfor my poor appetite for simple food. I was also quite a sloppy fellow\nand would slouch around on the sofas after coming back from the\ncollege, channel surfing as I watched TV, which must have been quite\nexasperating for both of them. Anyway, they took very good care of me,\nnot only in terms of feeding me but also going out of their way to make\narrangements for me to study at the Earthworm Institute, the spider\ncentre and later at the Crocodile Bank and I am most grateful for that.\nI hope when they read this book they will forgive me for all the\ntrouble I must have caused them.",
        "Extracts from Diary:\nEarthworms",
        "10th November: Sir gave me a book on earthworms to read, then Jagan\ntook me down to the field. There I was able to observe many organisms\nother than earthworms. We took a soil sample from one place and then\nwent back to the lab where we put the soil sample into the tulgren\nfunnel. I then went and brought three more samples from the vermi-tech\npit. We then put these also into three other tulgren funnels. By then\nit was lunch time and we all ate together. After lunch I weighed the\nsoil samples and got to see the organisms that were in the beaker under\nthe tulgren funnel. At 3.30 p.m I left for home.",
        "11th November: In the morning, I was given two types of earthworms i.e.\nLampito mauritii and Perionyx excavatus and told to observe them. I\nspent the whole morning doing this. After lunch, I wrote down the\nobservations that I had made. In the evening we went out to the College\nplayground and also to the area near the College Boarding to make some\nobservations. We dug two pits of 25 cm x 25 cm x 25 cm each at the\nplayground and one, of the same size, at the Boarding. We made many\nobservations which included the number and species of earthworms we\nfound and whether they were clitellates or not. We also made\nobservations regarding soil, atmospheric temperature and relative\nhumidity and took soil samples to measure the moisture content.",
        "12th November: Left for New College as usual. I was told that Sir did\nnot come today as he had a high viral fever. Yesterday a research\nscholar had expired and so there was a condolence meeting today. After\nthat everybody left as it was declared a holiday. I arrived home at\nabout 10.30 a.m. I had a bath and then some food. I then watched a bit\nof TV and wrote my diary. In the night Uncle Mano and Aunty Sagu had\ninvited some guests and had cooked chicken curry which I enjoyed very\nmuch.",
        "14th November: Sir did not arrive today either. With the help of Jagan\nI used the Infrared Moisture Balance to find out the moisture content\nof the soil samples which we had taken on Saturday. After we finished\none sample, the voltage started fluctuating so we used the tulgren\nfunnel instead. Then Jagan sent me to get soil samples from the field\nand from the area near the Boarding. We put the soil samples in the\ntulgren funnel and observed the arthropods that fell into the beaker\nunder a compound microscope. We also observed some preserved specimens\nof microarthropods.",
        "15th November: Pounded 100 gms of soil sample and then sieved each soil\nsample through 5 sieves. Then weighed the soil in each sieve and noted\nthis down.",
        "16th November: Did sieving of soil in the morning. In the evening, used\nKeenscups to find out the waterholding capacity/porosity.",
        "18th November: Sir arrived this morning. Read some books in the library\nfor sometime. Then did a bit of soil sieving and then did burning of\nsoil in a bunsen burner. In the afternoon, I watched a very comic film\ncalled “Junior Shylock”.",
        "19th November: Started preparing my report in rough. In the evening I\nwent with Babu to buy a film roll for taking photographs for my report.",
        "20th November: Did burning of a second sample of soil. After that\nJagan, Sir and I photographed microarthropods with the help of the\ncompound microscope that has a camera attached to it. After lunch, I\nattended a seminar conducted by one of the students.",
        "21st November: Ate a Perionyx excavatus earthworm in the morning. Then\nweighed some soil samples to find out the waterholding capacity of\ndifferent soils, weighed burnt soil, also learnt how to calculate and\nfind out soil texture of different samples of soil. Continued writing\nmy report.",
        "22nd November: Sat and wrote the final parts of my report. Then I gave\nit to Chitra who corrected it. After she finished, she gave it to Sir\nwho also made some corrections.",
        "23rd November: Wrote my report in fair in the new notebook I had\nbought. Then Jagan and I stuck the photographs we had clicked earlier\nin the various spaces in the notebook. Then Sir said that I would have\nto prepare a vermi-bed on my own. He gave me a bucket and I made a\nvermi-bed in it. Sir checked that I had done it correctly.",
        "24th November: Drew some diagrams that remained to be done in my\nnotebook. Then gave it to Sir for final approval. He made me write a\nfew lines about each photograph. He said I should come and collect it\nafter a week or so. After that I said bye to everyone and left at 4.30\nfor home.",
        "5th December: Today was a holiday, so I went to collect my report book\nfrom New College where I had given it to Sir for his signing. Met all\nmy friends there. All of them wrote their remarks in my report book and\nthen it was stamped. Sir gave me a certificate for the earthworm course\nI had finished at the Institute. Then Chitra dropped me in her Fiat car\nnear the Panagal Park bus stop.",
        "Field Notes on Vermiculture:\nTurning Garbage into Gold",
        "Vermicompost and vermiwash are the two earthworm products that have\nbecome very popular nowadays. Ordinary organic garbage which consists\nof litter, such as, kitchen waste and dead plant material is used and\nconverted into manure with the help of earthworms.",
        "There are three kinds of earthworms. One, the epigeal or surface\nearthworm (Perionyx excavatus) which eats only organic litter which is\npresent on the top layer of the soil. Two, the anecic earthworms\n(Lampito mauritii) which are present in the upper layers of soil and\nfeed on waste and leaf litter. The third kind are present deep inside\nthe soil and are known as endogeic earthworms (Octochaetona\nthriretonis).",
        "The most suitable earthworms recommended for vermiculture are the\nepigeic and anecic earthworms. Perionyx excavatus is purplish red and\nrough. Near the two ends the Perionyx excavatus is almost black in\ncolour. It is smaller and thinner (approx. 10 cms long) and more active\ncompared to the Lampito mauritii. They also breed faster than Lampito\nmauritii. Lampito mauritii are greyish white in colour and shiny,\nthicker and longer (length-16 cms) compared to Perionyx excavatus.",
        "Earthworms prefer cool temperatures, moist soil, humidity, relatively\nless sunlight and neither too coarse nor too fine sand. These are the\nideal conditions that must be kept in mind when using them for\nvermiculture. Since earthworms breathe through the skin, they perish if\ntheir skin becomes dry or the quantity of mucus diminishes. Hence to\nkeep earthworms alive in the vermicompost containers, care should be\ntaken to ensure that the vermibed remains moist. Earthworms however do\nnot prefer waterlogged soils. In fact if earthworms are kept in water\nfor too long, the concentration of ammonia that is discharged through\ntheir excreta makes the water too toxic for the earthworms to survive.\nEarthworms also cannot tolerate salt or salt water even briefly.",
        "Earthworms are hermaphrodites. Depending on the species, their life\nspan is between six months to one year. Fully matured earthworms upon\nmating shed their clitellum (a small band like an overgrowth of skin)\nand produce cocoons which take about 14 days to incubate and hatch into\njuveniles. Maximum three juveniles are hatched from each cocoon. From\nthe juvenile to the clitellate stage i.e. the fully matured or\nreproductive stage it takes 15-18 days. Thus earthworms are able to\nmultiply several times in their life span which makes them ideally\nsuited to process even large quantities of garbage.",
        "A pit, a small plastic or wooden crate or, even a bucket, can be used\nfor vermicomposting organic matter. Although not necessary, two crates\ncan be used simultaneously; while one is being used for fresh garbage,\nthe garbage in the other can be allowed to decompose.",
        "First, 6-8 holes should be made (one at each corner and four in the\nmiddle of the crate). A pot or a bucket needs about 3-5 holes. The\ncrate or pit must first be filled with a one inch layer of pebbles or\nbroken bricks. Then, a half to one inch layer of sand should be spread.\nOver that, a five to six inch layer of soil should be spread. Then\nLampito mauritii and Perionyx excavatus earthworms should be\nintroduced. The soil must then be moistened with water. A little bit of\ncowdung (nitrogen) and some hay (carbon) should be spread on it, and\nthe contents of the pit left for 20-30 days. This is called a vermibed.\nThe cowdung and hay will allow the worms to multiply. With this, the\nvermicompost crate or pit will be ready for processing organic waste.",
        "All organic waste should be evenly spread out on the vermibed. As far\nas possible add garbage in small quantities regularly rather than\ndumping large quantities at one go. The earthworm begins processing the\ngarbage immediately. Water the container occasionally so that the\nvermibed remains moist. Once the container is full with organic waste,\nit should be covered with a little soil and allowed to decompose\nundisturbed. Only watering the pit should continue. After it has\ndecomposed fully (roughly 45 days) watering must be stopped for about 3\nto 5 days. This will force the earthworms to migrate down to the bottom\nof the container which will have some moisture as compared with the top\nsoil. Then the top layer of soil which is really the organic matter\nwhich has been converted into manure should be removed without\ndisturbing the vermibed. This organic manure can be used for plants.",
        "A drum, barrel or bucket can be used for making vermiwash. The drum or\nbucket should be placed on supports a little above the ground. A hole\nshould be made at the bottom of the container. A pipe should be pushed\nthrough the hole and a tap attached to the outer end.",
        "The bottom of the drum should be covered with a layer of gravel (about\n6-8 inches). Over it, a layer of sand (6-8 inches), and then a layer of\nsoil (6-8 inches) should be spread. The earthworms should then be\nintroduced and the soil moistened a little. Then a little bit of\ncowdung and hay should be mixed together and scattered over it. This\nshould be left for a few days.",
        "Whenever vermiwash is needed, water should be sprinkled with a shower\nor, gradually poured on top of it (5 litres of water for a 150 litres\ndrum). The water will pass through the earthworm burrows and the\norganically rich soil will become liquid manure and can be collected at\nthe bottom of the container. As the hay and cowdung is eaten up by the\nearthworms, this should gradually be replaced.",
        "In nature, litter is decomposed in a way similar to what happens in a\nvermicompost pit. Litter (consisting of leaf material, twigs, bark,\ndead wood, flowers, fruits and other plant and animal material) that\nfalls on the ground is constantly moistened by dew or rain.\nDecomposition then sets in with the help of microbes, fungi and\nmicroarthropods.",
        "Microarthropods are of two kinds-the detritivores that feed on the\nlitter attacked by the microbes and fungi and the predators that feed\non the detritivores. The litter that has not been decomposed, dead\nmicrobes and microarthropods, along with their excretions and\nsecretions, mix and form humus. This humus is in a complex form and\ntherefore not available to the plants for use. Here is where earthworms\ncome into the picture. The earthworms present in the soil feed on the\nhumus. The castings (wormicasts) excreted by these earthworms, as a\nresult, contain nutrients in a form that is readily available to the\nplants for their growth. The plants in turn, when they die or shed\nleaves, contribute to the litter which becomes food for microbes and\nfungi. Thus nature’s cycle is made whole and complete.",
        "Earthworms have proven that they are wonderful creatures for they can\ntruly turn garbage into gold.",
