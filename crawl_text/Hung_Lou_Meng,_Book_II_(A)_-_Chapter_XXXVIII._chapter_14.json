        "  Lin Hsiao-Hsiang carries the first prize in the poems on\n      chrysanthemums.\n  Hsueh Heng-wu chaffs Pao-yü by composing verses in the same style as\n      his on the crabs.",
        "After Pao-ch’ai and Hsiang-yün, we will now explain, settled everything\nin their deliberations, nothing memorable occurred, the whole night,\nwhich deserves to be put on record.",
        "The next day, Hsiang-yün invited dowager lady Chia and her other\nrelatives to come and look at the olea flowers. Old lady Chia and every\none else answered that as she had had the kind attention to ask them,\nthey felt it their duty to avail themselves of her gracious invitation,\nmuch though they would be putting her to trouble and inconvenience. At\ntwelve o’clock, therefore, old lady Chia actually took with her Madame\nWang and lady Feng, as well as Mrs. Hsüeh and other members of her\nfamily whom she had asked to join them, and repaired into the garden.",
        "“Which is the best spot?” old lady Chia inquired.",
        "“We are ready to go wherever you may like, dear senior,” Madame Wang\nventured in response.",
        "“A collation has already been spread in the Lotus Fragrance Arbour,\"\nlady Feng interposed. “Besides, the two olea plants, on that hill,\nyonder, are now lovely in their full blossom, and the water of that\nstream is jade-like and pellucid, so if we sit in the pavilion in the\nmiddle of it, won’t we enjoy an open and bright view? It will be\nrefreshing too to our eyes to watch the pool.”",
        "“Quite right!” assented dowager lady Chia at this suggestion; and while\nexpressing her approbation, she ushered her train of followers into the\nArbour of Lotus Fragrance.",
        "This Arbour of Lotus Fragrance had, in fact, been erected in the centre\nof the pool. It had windows on all four sides. On the left and on the\nright, stood covered passages, which spanned the stream and connected\nwith the hills. At the back, figured a winding bridge.",
        "As the party ascended the bamboo bridge, lady Feng promptly advanced and\nsupported dowager lady Chia. “Venerable ancestor,” she said, “just walk\nboldly and with confident step; there’s nothing to fear; it’s the way of\nthese bamboo bridges to go on creaking like this.”",
        "Presently, they entered the arbour. Here they saw two additional bamboo\ntables, placed beyond the balustrade. On the one, were arranged cups,\nchopsticks and every article necessary for drinking wine. On the other,\nwere laid bamboo utensils for tea, a tea-service and various cups and\nsaucers. On the off side, two or three waiting-maids were engaged in\nfanning the stove to boil the water for tea. On the near side were\nvisible several other girls, who were trying with their fans to get a\nfire to light in the stove so as to warm the wines.",
        "“It was a capital idea,” dowager lady Chia hastily exclaimed laughingly\nwith vehemence, “to bring tea here. What’s more, the spot and the\nappurtenances are alike so spick and span!”",
        "“These things were brought by cousin Pao-ch’ai,” Hsiang-yün smilingly\nexplained, “so I got them ready.”",
        "“This child is, I say, so scrupulously particular,” old lady Chia\nobserved, “that everything she does is thoroughly devised.”",
        "As she gave utterance to her feelings, her attention was attracted by a\npair of scrolls of black lacquer, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, suspended\non the pillars, and she asked Hsiang-yün to tell her what the mottoes\nwere.",
        "The text she read was:",
        "  Snapped is the shade of the hibiscus by the fragrant oar of a boat\n      homeward bound.\n  Deep flows the perfume of the lily and the lotus underneath the bamboo\n      bridge.",
        "After listening to the motto, old lady Chia raised her head and cast a\nglance upon the tablet; then turning round: “Long ago, when I was\nyoung,” she observed, addressing herself to Mrs. Hsüeh, “we likewise had\nat home a pavilion like this called ’the Hall reclining on the russet\nclouds,’ or some other such name. At that time, I was of the same age as\nthe girls, and my wont was to go day after day and play with my sisters\nthere. One day, I, unexpectedly, slipped and fell into the water, and I\nhad a narrow escape from being drowned; for it was after great\ndifficulty, that they managed to drag me out safe and sound. But my head\nwas, after all, bumped about against the wooden nails; so much so, that\nthis hole of the length of a finger, which you can see up to this day on\nmy temple, comes from the bruises I sustained. All my people were in a\nfunk that I’d be the worse for this ducking and continued in fear and\ntrembling lest I should catch a chill. ’It was dreadful, dreadful!’ they\nopined, but I managed, little though every one thought it, to keep in\nsplendid health.”",
        "Lady Feng allowed no time to any one else to put in a word; but\nanticipating them: “Had you then not survived, who would now be enjoying\nthese immense blessings!” she smiled. “This makes it evident that no\nsmall amount of happiness and long life were in store for you, venerable\nancestor, from your very youth up! It was by the agency of the spirits\nthat this hole was knocked open so that they might fill it up with\nhappiness and longevity! The old man Shou Hsing had, in fact, a hole in\nhis head, which was so full of every kind of blessing conducive to\nhappiness and long life that it bulged up ever so high!”",
        "Before, however, she could conclude, dowager lady Chia and the rest were\nconvulsed with such laughter that their bodies doubled in two.",
        "“This monkey is given to dreadful tricks!” laughed old lady Chia. “She’s\nalways ready to make a scapegoat of me to evoke amusement. But would\nthat I could take that glib mouth of yours and rend it in pieces.”",
        "“It’s because I feared that the cold might, when you by and bye have\nsome crabs to eat, accumulate in your intestines,” lady Feng pleaded,\n“that I tried to induce you, dear senior, to have a laugh, so as to make\nyou gay and merry. For one can, when in high spirits, indulge in a\ncouple of them more with impunity.”",
        "“By and bye,” smiled old lady Chia, “I’ll make you follow me day and\nnight, so that I may constantly be amused and feel my mind diverted; I\nwon’t let you go back to your home.”",
        "“It’s that weakness of yours for her, venerable senior,” Madame Wang\nobserved with a smile, “that has got her into the way of behaving in\nthis manner, and, if you go on speaking to her as you do, she’ll soon\nbecome ever so much the more unreasonable.”",
        "“I like her such as she is,” dowager lady Chia laughed. “Besides, she’s\ntruly no child, ignorant of the distinction between high and low. When\nwe are at home, with no strangers present, we ladies should be on terms\nlike these, and as long, in fact, as we don’t overstep propriety, it’s\nall right. If not, what would he the earthly use of making them behave\nlike so many saints?”",
        "While bandying words, they entered the pavilion in a body. After tea,\nlady Feng hastened to lay out the cups and chopsticks. At the upper\ntable then seated herself old lady Chia, Mrs. Hsüeh, Pao-ch’ai, Tai-yü\nand Pao-yü. Round the table, on the east, sat Shih Hsiang-yün, Madame\nWang, Ying Ch’un, T’an Ch’un and Hsi Ch’un. At the small table, leaning\nagainst the door on the west side, Li Wan and lady Feng assigned\nthemselves places. But it was for the mere sake of appearances, as\nneither of them ventured to sit down, but remained in attendance at the\ntwo tables, occupied by old lady Chia and Madame Wang.",
        "“You’d better,” lady Feng said, “not bring in too many crabs at a time.\nThrow these again into the steaming-basket! Only serve ten; and when\nthey’re eaten, a fresh supply can be fetched!”",
        "Asking, at the same time, for water, she washed her hands, and, taking\nher position near dowager lady Chia, she scooped out the meat from a\ncrab, and offered the first help to Mrs. Hsüeh.",
        "“They’ll be sweeter were I to open them with my own hands,” Mrs. Hsüeh\nremarked, “there’s no need for any one to serve me.”",
        "Lady Feng, therefore, presented it to old lady Chia and handed a second\nportion to Pao-yü.",
        "“Make the wine as warm as possible and bring it in!” she then went on to\ncry. “Go,” she added, directing the servant-girls, “and fetch the\npowder, made of green beans, and scented with the leaves of\nchrysanthemums and the stamens of the olea fragrans; and keep it ready\nto rinse our hands with.”",
        "Shih Hsiang-yün had a crab to bear the others company, but no sooner had\nshe done than she retired to a lower seat, from where she helped her\nguests. When she, however, walked out a second time to give orders to\nfill two dishes and send them over to Mrs. Chao, she perceived lady Feng\ncome up to her again. “You’re not accustomed to entertaining,” she said,\n“so go and have your share to eat. I’ll attend to the people for you\nfirst, and, when they’ve gone, I’ll have all I want.”",
        "Hsiang-yün would not agree to her proposal. But giving further\ndirections to the servants to spread two tables under the verandah on\nthe off-side, she pressed Yüan Yang, Hu Po, Ts’ai Hsia, Ts’ai Yün and\nP’ing Erh to go and seat themselves.",
        "“Lady Secunda,” consequently ventured Yüan Yang, “you’re in here doing\nthe honours, so may I go and have something to eat?”",
        "“You can all go,” replied lady Feng; “leave everything in my charge, and\nit will be all right.”",
        "While these words were being spoken, Shih Hsiang-yün resumed her place\nat the banquet. Lady Feng and Li Wan then took hurry-scurry something to\neat as a matter of form; but lady Feng came down once more to look after\nthings. After a time, she stepped out on the verandah where Yüan Yang\nand the other girls were having their refreshments in high glee. As soon\nas they caught sight of her, Yuan Yang and her companions stood up.\n“What has your ladyship come out again for?” they inquired. “Do let us\nalso enjoy a little peace and quiet!”",
        "“This chit Yüan Yang is worse than ever!” lady Feng laughed. “Here I’m\nslaving away for you, and, instead of feeling grateful to me, you bear\nme a grudge! But don’t you yet quick pour me a cup of wine?”",
        "Yüan Yang immediately smiled, and filling a cup, she applied it to lady\nFeng’s lips. Lady Feng stretched out her neck and emptied it. But Hu Po\nand Ts’ai Hsia thereupon likewise replenished a cup and put it to lady\nFeng’s mouth. Lady Feng swallowed the contents of that as well. P’ing\nErh had, by this time, brought her some yellow meat which she had picked\nout from the shell. “Pour plenty of ginger and vinegar!” shouted lady\nFeng, and, in a moment, she made short work of that too. “You people,\"\nshe smiled, “had better sit down and have something to eat, for I’m off\nnow.”",
        "“You brazen-faced thing,” exclaimed Yüan Yang laughingly, “to eat what\nwas intended for us!”",
        "“Don’t be so captious with me!” smiled lady Feng. “Are you aware that\nyour master Secundus, Mr. Lien, has taken such a violent fancy to you\nthat he means to speak to our old lady to let you be his secondary\nwife!”",
        "Yüan Yang blushed crimson. “Ts’ui!” she shouted. “Are these really words\nto issue from the mouth of a lady! But if I don’t daub your face all\nover with my filthy hands, I won’t feel happy!”",
        "Saying this, she rushed up to her. She was about to besmear her face,\nwhen lady Feng pleaded: “My dear child, do let me off this time!”",
        "“Lo, that girl Yüan,” laughed Hu Po, “wishes to smear her, and that\nhussey P’ing still spares her! Look here, she has scarcely had two\ncrabs, and she has drunk a whole saucerful of vinegar!”",
        "P’ing Erh was holding a crab full of yellow meat, which she was in the\nact of cleaning. As soon therefore as she heard this taunt, she came,\ncrab in hand, to spatter Hu Po’s face, as she laughingly reviled her.\n“I’ll take you minx with that cajoling tongue of yours” she cried,\n“and....”",
        "But, Hu Po, while also indulging in laughter, drew aside; so P’ing Erh\nbeat the air, and fell forward, daubing, by a strange coincidence, the\ncheek of lady Feng. Lady Feng was at the moment having a little\ngood-humoured raillery with Yüan Yang, and was taken so much off her\nguard, that she was quite startled out of her senses. “Ai-yah!” she\nejaculated. The bystanders found it difficult to keep their countenance,\nand, with one voice, they exploded into a boisterous fit of laughter.\nLady Feng as well could not help feeling amused, and smilingly she\nupbraided her. “You stupid wench!” she said; “Have you by gorging lost\nyour eyesight that you recklessly smudge your mistress’ face?”",
        "P’ing Erh hastily crossed over and wiped her face for her, and then went\nin person to fetch some water.",
        "“O-mi-to-fu,” ejaculated Yüan Yang, “this is a distinct retribution!”",
        "Dowager lady Chia, though seated on the other side, overheard their\nshouts, and she consecutively made inquiries as to what they had seen to\ntickled their fancy so. “Tell us,” (she urged), “what it is so that we\ntoo should have a laugh.”",
        "“Our lady Secunda,” Yüan Yang and the other maids forthwith laughingly\ncried, “came to steal our crabs and eat them, and P’ing Erh got angry\nand daubed her mistress’ face all over with yellow meat. So our mistress\nand that slave-girl are now having a scuffle over it.”",
        "This report filled dowager lady Chia, Madame Wang and the other inmates\nwith them with much merriment. “Do have pity on her,” dowager lady Chia\nlaughed, “and let her have some of those small legs and entrails to eat,\nand have done!”",
        "Yuan Yang and her companions assented, much amused. “Mistress Secunda,\"\nthey shouted in a loud tone of voice, “you’re at liberty to eat this\nwhole tableful of legs!”",
        "But having washed her face clean, lady Feng approached old lady Chia and\nthe other guests and waited upon them for a time, while they partook of\nrefreshments.",
        "Tai-yü did not, with her weak physique, venture to overload her stomach,\nso partaking of a little meat from the claws, she left the table.\nPresently, however, dowager lady Chia too abandoned all idea of having\nanything more to eat. The company therefore quitted the banquet; and,\nwhen they had rinsed their hands, some admired the flowers, some played\nwith the water, others looked at the fish.",
        "After a short stroll, Madame Wang turned round and remarked to old lady\nChia: “There’s plenty of wind here. Besides, you’ve just had crabs; so\nit would be prudent for you, venerable senior, to return home and rest.\nAnd if you feel in the humour, we can come again for a turn to-morrow.”",
        "“Quite true!” acquiesced dowager lady Chia, in reply to this suggestion.\n“I was afraid that if I left, now that you’re all in exuberant spirits,\nI mightn’t again be spoiling your fun, (so I didn’t budge). But as the\nidea originates from yourselves do go as you please, (while I retire).\nBut,” she said to Hsiang-yün, “don’t allow your cousin Secundus, Pao-yü,\nand your cousin Lin to have too much to eat.” Then when Hsiang-yün had\nsignified her obedience, “You two girls,” continuing, she recommended\nHsiang-yün and Pao-ch’ai, “must not also have more than is good for you.\nThose things are, it’s true, luscious, but they’re not very wholesome;\nand if you eat immoderately of them, why, you’ll get stomachaches.”",
        "Both girls promised with alacrity to be careful; and, having escorted\nher beyond the confines of the garden, they retraced their steps and\nordered the servants to clear the remnants of the banquet and to lay out\na new supply of refreshments.",
        "“There’s no use of any regular spread out!” Pao-yü interposed. “When you\nare about to write verses, that big round table can be put in the centre\nand the wines and eatables laid on it. Neither will there be any need to\nceremoniously have any fixed seats. Let those who may want anything to\neat, go up to it and take what they like; and if we seat ourselves,\nscattered all over the place, won’t it be far more convenient for us?”",
        "“Your idea is excellent!” Pao-ch’ai answered.",
        "“This is all very well,” Hsiang-yün observed, “but there are others to\nbe studied besides ourselves!”",
        "Issuing consequently further directions for another table to be laid,\nand picking out some hot crabs, she asked Hsi Jen, Tzu Chüan, Ssu Ch’i,\nShih Shu, Ju Hua, Ying Erh, Ts’ui Mo and the other girls to sit together\nand form a party. Then having a couple of flowered rugs spread under the\nolea trees on the hills, she bade the matrons on duty, the waiting-maids\nand other servants to likewise make themselves comfortable and to eat\nand drink at their pleasure until they were wanted, when they could come\nand answer the calls.",
        "Hsiang-yün next fetched the themes for the verses and pinned them with a\nneedle on the wall. “They’re full of originality,” one and all exclaimed\nafter perusal, “we fear we couldn’t write anything on them.”",
        "Hsiang-yün then went onto explain to them the reasons that had prompted\nher not to determine upon any particular rhymes.",
        "“Yes, quite right!” put in Pao-yü. “I myself don’t fancy hard and fast\nrhymes!”",
        "But Lin Tai-yü, being unable to stand much wine and to take any crabs,\ntold, on her own account, a servant to fetch an embroidered cushion;\nand, seating herself in such a way as to lean against the railing, she\ntook up a fishing-rod and began to fish. Pao-ch’ai played for a time\nwith a twig of olea she held in her hand, then resting on the\nwindow-sill, she plucked the petals, and threw them into the water,\nattracting the fish, which went by, to rise to the surface and nibble at\nthem. Hsiang-yün, after a few moments of abstraction, urged Hsi Jen and\nthe other girls to help themselves to anything they wanted, and beckoned\nto the servants, seated at the foot of the hill, to eat to their heart’s\ncontent. Tan Ch’un, in company with Li Wan and Hsi Ch’un, stood\nmeanwhile under the shade of the weeping willows, and looked at the\nwidgeons and egrets. Ying Ch’un, on the other hand, was all alone under\nthe shade of some trees, threading double jasmine flowers, with a needle\nspecially adapted for the purpose. Pao-yü too watched Tai-yü fishing for\na while. At one time he leant next to Pao-ch’ai and cracked a few jokes\nwith her. And at another, he drank, when he noticed Hsi Jen feasting on\ncrabs with her companions, a few mouthfuls of wine to keep her company.\nAt this, Hsi Jen cleaned the meat out of a shell, and gave it to him to\neat.",
        "Tai-yü then put down the fishing-rod, and, approaching the seats, she\nlaid hold of a small black tankard, ornamented with silver plum flowers,\nand selected a tiny cup, made of transparent stone, red like a begonia,\nand in the shape of a banana leaf. A servant-girl observed her\nmovements, and, concluding that she felt inclined to have a drink, she\ndrew near with hurried step to pour some wine for her.",
        "“You girls had better go on eating,” Tai-yü remonstrated, “and let me\nhelp myself; there’ll be some fun in it then!”",
        "So speaking, she filled for herself a cup half full; but discovering\nthat it was yellow wine, “I’ve eaten only a little bit of crab,” she\nsaid, “and yet I feel my mouth slightly sore; so what would do for me\nnow is a mouthful of very hot distilled spirit.”",
        "Pao-yü hastened to take up her remark. “There’s some distilled spirit,\"\nhe chimed in. “Take some of that wine,” he there and then shouted out to\na servant, “scented with acacia flowers, and warm a tankard of it.”",
        "When however it was brought Tai-yü simply took a sip and put it down\nagain.",
        "Pao-ch’ai too then came forward, and picked up a double cup; but, after\ndrinking a mouthful of it, she lay it aside, and, moistening her pen,\nshe walked up to the wall, and marked off the first theme: “longing for\nchrysanthemums,” below which she appended a character “Heng.”",
        "“My dear cousin,” promptly remarked Pao-yü. “I’ve already got four lines\nof the second theme so let me write on it!”",
        "“I managed, after ever so much difficulty, to put a stanza together,\"\nPao-ch’ai smiled, “and are you now in such a hurry to deprive me of it?”",
        "Without so much as a word, Tai-yü took a pen and put a distinctive sign\nopposite the eighth, consisting of: “ask the chrysanthemums;” and,\nsingling out, in quick succession, the eleventh: “dream of\nchrysanthemums,” as well, she too affixed for herself the word “Hsiao\"\nbelow. But Pao-yü likewise got a pen, and marked his choice, the twelfth\non the list: “seek for chrysanthemums,” by the side of which he wrote\nthe character “Chiang.”",
        "T’an Ch’un thereupon rose to her feet. “If there’s no one to write on\n’Pinning the chrysanthemums’” she observed, while scrutinising the\nthemes, “do let me have it! It has just been ruled,” she continued,\npointing at Pao-yü with a significant smile, “that it is on no account\npermissible to introduce any expressions, bearing reference to the inner\nchambers, so you’d better be on your guard!”",
        "But as she spoke, she perceived Hsiang-yün come forward, and jointly\nmark the fourth and fifth, that is: “facing the chrysanthemums,” and\n“putting chrysanthemums in vases,” to which she, like the others,\nappended a word, Hsiang.”",
        "“You too should get a style or other!” T’an Ch’un suggested.",
        "“In our home,” smiled Hsiang-yün, “there exist, it is true, at present\nseveral halls and structures, but as I don’t live in either, there’ll be\nno fun in it were I to borrow the name of any one of them!”",
        "“Our venerable senior just said,” Pao-ch’ai observed laughingly, “that\nthere was also in your home a water-pavilion called ’leaning on russet\nclouds hall,’ and is it likely that it wasn’t yours? But albeit it\ndoesn’t exist now-a-days, you were anyhow its mistress of old.”",
        "“She’s right!” one and all exclaimed.",
        "Pao-yü therefore allowed Hsiang-yün no time to make a move, but\nforthwith rubbed off the character “Hsiang,” for her and substituted\nthat of “Hsia” (russet).",
        "A short time only elapsed before the compositions on the twelve themes\nhad all been completed. After they had each copied out their respective\nverses, they handed them to Ying Ch’un, who took a separate sheet of\nsnow-white fancy paper, and transcribed them together, affixing\ndistinctly under each stanza the style of the composer. Li Wan and her\nassistants then began to read, starting from the first on the list, the\nverses which follow:",

        "  With anguish sore I face the western breeze, and wrapt in grief, I\n      pine for you!\n  What time the smart weed russet turns, and the reeds white, my heart\n      is rent in two.\n  When in autumn the hedges thin, and gardens waste, all trace of you is\n      gone.\n  When the moon waxeth cold, and the dew pure, my dreams then know\n      something of you.\n  With constant yearnings my heart follows you as far as wild geese\n      homeward fly.\n  Lonesome I sit and lend an ear, till a late hour to the sound of the\n      block!\n  For you, ye yellow flowers, I’ve grown haggard and worn, but who doth\n      pity me,\n  And breathe one word of cheer that in the ninth moon I will soon meet\n      you again?",

        "  Eating the bread of idleness, the frenzy of poetry creeps over me both\n      night and day.\n  Round past the hedge I wend, and, leaning on the rock, I intone verses\n      gently to myself.\n  From the point of my pencil emanate lines of recondite grace, so near\n      the frost I write.\n  Some scent I hold by the side of my mouth, and, turning to the moon, I\n      sing my sentiments.\n  With self-pitying lines pages I fill, so as utterance to give to all\n      my cares and woes.\n  From these few scanty words, who could fathom the secrets of my heart\n      about the autumntide?\n  Beginning from the time when T’ao, the magistrate, did criticise the\n      beauty of your bloom,\n  Yea, from that date remote up to this very day, your high renown has\n      ever been extolled.",
        "“Drawing chrysanthemums,” by the “Princess of Heng Wu.”",
        "  Verses I’ve had enough, so with my pens I play; with no idea that I am\n      mad.\n  Do I make use of pigments red or green as to involve a task of\n      toilsome work?\n  To form clusters of leaves, I sprinkle simply here and there a\n      thousand specks of ink.\n  And when I’ve drawn the semblance of the flowers, some spots I make to\n      represent the frost.\n  The light and dark so life-like harmonise with the figure of those\n      there in the wind,\n  That when I’ve done tracing their autumn growth, a fragrant smell\n      issues under my wrist.\n  Do you not mark how they resemble those, by the east hedge, which you\n      leisurely pluck?\n  Upon the screens their image I affix to solace me for those of the\n      ninth moon.",
        "“Asking the chrysanthemums,” by the “Hsiao Hsiang consort.”",
        "  Your heart, in autumn, I would like to read, but know it no one could!\n  While humming with my arms behind my back, on the east hedge I rap.\n  So peerless and unique are ye that who is meet with you to stay?\n  Why are you of all flowers the only ones to burst the last in bloom?\n  Why in such silence plunge the garden dew and the frost in the hall?\n  When wild geese homeward fly and crickets sicken, do you think of me?\n  Do not tell me that in the world none of you grow with power of\n      speech?\n  But if ye fathom what I say, why not converse with me a while?",
        "“Pinning the chrysanthemums in the hair,” by the “Visitor under the\nbanana trees.”",
        "  I put some in a vase, and plant some by the hedge, so day by day I\n      have ample to do.\n  I pluck them, yet don’t fancy they are meant for girls to pin before\n      the glass in their coiffure.\n  My mania for these flowers is just as keen as was that of the squire,\n      who once lived in Ch’ang An.\n  I rave as much for them as raved Mr. P’eng Tsê, when he was under the\n      effects of wine.\n  Cold is the short hair on his temples and moistened with dew, which on\n      it dripped from the three paths.\n  His flaxen turban is suffused with the sweet fragrance of the autumn\n      frost in the ninth moon.\n  That strong weakness of mine to pin them in my hair is viewed with\n      sneers by my contemporaries.\n  They clap their hands, but they are free to laugh at me by the\n      roadside as much us e’er they list.",
        "“The shadow of the chrysanthemums,” by the “Old Friend of the hall\nreclining on the russet clouds.”",
        "  In layers upon layers their autumn splendour grows and e’er thick and\n      thicker.\n  I make off furtively, and stealthily transplant them from the three\n      crossways.\n  The distant lamp, inside the window-frame, depicts their shade both\n      far and near.\n  The hedge riddles the moon’s rays, like unto a sieve, but the flowers\n      stop the holes.\n  As their reflection cold and fragrant tarries here, their soul must\n      too abide.\r\n  The dew-dry spot beneath the flowers is so like them that what is said\n      of dreams is trash.\n  Their precious shadows, full of subtle scent, are trodden down to\n      pieces here and there.\n  Could any one with eyes half closed from drinking, not mistake the\n      shadow for the flowers.",
        "“Dreaming of chrysanthemums,” by the “Hsiao Hsiang consort.”",
        "  What vivid dreams arise as I dose by the hedge amidst those autumn\n      scenes!\n  Whether clouds bear me company or the moon be my mate, I can’t\n      discern.\n  In fairyland I soar, not that I would become a butterfly like Chang.\n  So long I for my old friend T’ao, the magistrate, that I again seek\n      him.\n  In a sound sleep I fell; but so soon as the wild geese cried, they\n      broke my rest.\n  The chirp of the cicadas gave me such a start that I bear them a\n      grudge.\n  My secret wrongs to whom can I go and divulge, when I wake up from\n      sleep?\n  The faded flowers and the cold mist make my feelings of anguish know\n      no bounds.",
        "“Fading of the chrysanthemums,” by the “Visitor under the banana trees.”",
        "  The dew congeals; the frost waxes in weight; and gradually dwindles\n      their bloom.\n  After the feast, with the flower show, follows the season of the\n      ’little snow.’\n  The stalks retain still some redundant smell, but the flowers’ golden\n      tinge is faint.\n  The stems do not bear sign of even one whole leaf; their verdure is\n      all past.\n  Naught but the chirp of crickets strikes my ear, while the moon shines\n      on half my bed.\n  Near the cold clouds, distant a thousand li, a flock of wild geese\n      slowly fly.\n  When autumn breaks again next year, I feel certain that we will meet\n      once more.\n  We part, but only for a time, so don’t let us indulge in anxious\n      thoughts.",
        "Each stanza they read they praised; and they heaped upon each other\nincessant eulogiums.",
        "“Let me now criticise them; I’ll do so with all fairness!” Li Wan\nsmiled. “As I glance over the page,” she said, “I find that each of you\nhas some distinct admirable sentiments; but in order to be impartial in\nmy criticism to-day, I must concede the first place to: ’Singing the\nchrysanthemums;’ the second to: ’Asking the chrysanthemums;’ and the\nthird to: ’Dreaming of chrysanthemums.’ The original nature of the\nthemes makes the verses full of originality, and their conception still\nmore original. But we must allow to the ’Hsiao Hsiang consort’ the\ncredit of being the best; next in order following: ’Pinning\nchrysanthemums in the hair,’ ’Facing the chrysanthemums,’ ’Putting the\nchrysanthemums, in vases,’ ’Drawing the chrysanthemums,’ and ’Longing\nfor chrysanthemums,’ as second best.”",
        "This decision filled Pao-yü with intense gratification. Clapping his\nhands, “Quite right! it’s most just,” he shouted.",
        "“My verses are worth nothing!” Tai-yü remarked. “Their fault, after all,\nis that they are a little too minutely subtile.”",
        "“They are subtile but good,” Li Wan rejoined; “for there’s no\nartificialness or stiffness about them.”",
        "“According to my views,” Tai-yü observed, “the best line is:",
        " “’When cold holdeth the park and the sun’s rays do slant, I long and\n      yearn for you, old friends.’",
        "“The metonomy:",
        " “’I fling my book aside and turn my gaze upon a twig of autumn.’",
        "is already admirable! She has dealt so exhaustively with ’putting\nchrysanthemums in a vase’ that she has left nothing unsaid that could be\nsaid, and has had in consequence to turn her thought back and consider\nthe time anterior to their being plucked and placed in vases. Her\nsentiments are profound!”",
        "“What you say is certainly so,” explained Li Wan smiling; “but that line\nof yours:",
        " “’Some scent I hold by the side of my mouth,....’",
        "“beats that.”",
        "“After all,” said T’an Ch’un, “we must admit that there’s depth of\nthought in those of the ’Princess of Heng Wu’ with:",
        " “’...in autumn all trace of you is gone;’",
        "“and",
        " “’...my dreams then know something of you!’",
        "“They really make the meaning implied by the words ’long for’ stand out\nclearly.”",
        "“Those passages of yours:",
        " “’Cold is the short hair on his temples and moistened....’",
        "“and",
        " “’His flaxen turban is suffused with the sweet fragrance....;’”",
        "laughingly observed Puo-ch’ai, “likewise bring out the idea of ’pinning\nthe chrysanthemums in the hair’ so thoroughly that one couldn’t get a\nloop hole for fault-finding.”",
        "Hsiang-yün then smiled.",
        "  “’...who is meet with you to stay’”",
        "she said, “and",
        " “’...burst the last in bloom.’",
        "“are questions so straight to the point set to the chrysanthemums, that\nthey are quite at a loss what answer to give.”",
        "“Were what you say:",
        " “’I sit with head uncovered....’",
        "“and",
        " “’...clasping my knees, I hum my lays....’",
        "“as if you couldn’t, in fact, tear yourself away for even a moment from\nthem,” Li Wan laughed, “to come to the knowledge of the chrysanthemums,\nwhy, they would certainly be sick and tired of you.”",
        "This joke made every one laugh.",
        "“I’m last again!” smiled Pao-yü. “Is it likely that:",
        " “’Who plants the flowers?....\n  ...in autumn where do they go?\n  With sandals waxed I come from distant shores;....\n  ...and as on this cold day I can’t exhaust my song;....’",
        "“do not all forsooth amount to searching for chrysanthemums? And that",
        " “’Last night they got a shower....\n  And this morn ... bedecked with frost,’",
        "“don’t both bear on planting them? But unfortunately they can’t come up\nto these lines:",
        " “’Some scent I hold by the side of my mouth and turning to the moon I\n      sing my sentiments.’\n  ’In their pure and cool fragrance, clasping my knees I hum my lays.’\n  ’...short hair on his temples....’\n  ’His flaxen turban....\n  ...golden tinge is faint.\n  ...verdure is all past.\n  ...in autumn ... all trace of you is gone.\n  ...my dreams then know something of you.’",
        "“But to-morrow,” he proceeded, “if I have got nothing to do, I’ll write\ntwelve stanzas my self.”",
        "“Yours are also good,” Li Wan pursued, “the only thing is that they\naren’t as full of original conception as those other lines, that’s all.”",
        "But after a few further criticisms, they asked for some more warm crabs;\nand, helping themselves, as soon as they were brought, from the large\ncircular table, they regaled themselves for a time.",
        "“With the crabs to-day in one’s hand and the olea before one’s eyes, one\ncannot help inditing verses,” Pao-yü smiled. “I’ve already thought of a\nfew; but will any of you again have the pluck to devise any?”",
        "With this challenge, he there and then hastily washed his hands and\npicking up a pen he wrote out what, his companions found on perusal, to\nrun in this strain:",
        "  When in my hands I clasp a crab what most enchants my heart is the\n      cassia’s cool shade.\n  While I pour vinegar and ground ginger, I feel from joy as if I would\n      go mad.\n  With so much gluttony the prince’s grandson eats his crabs that he\n      should have some wine.\n  The side-walking young gentleman has no intestines in his frame at\n      all.\n  I lose sight in my greediness that in my stomach cold accumulates.\n  To my fingers a strong smell doth adhere and though I wash them yet\n      the smell clings fast.\n  The main secret of this is that men in this world make much of food.\n  The P’o Spirit has laughed at them that all their lives they only seek\n      to eat.",
        "“I could readily compose a hundred stanzas with such verses in no time,\"\nTai-yü observed with a sarcastic smile.",
        "“Your mental energies are now long ago exhausted,” Pao-yü rejoined\nlaughingly, “and instead of confessing your inability to devise any, you\nstill go on heaping invective upon people!”",
        "Tai-yü, upon catching this insinuation, made no reply of any kind; but\nslightly raising her head she hummed something to herself for a while,\nand then taking up a pen she completed a whole stanza with a few dashes.",
        "The company then read her lines. They consisted of–",
        "  E’en after death, their armour and their lengthy spears are never cast\n      away.\n  So nice they look, piled in the plate, that first to taste them I’d\n      fain be.\n  In every pair of legs they have, the crabs are full of tender\n      jade-like meat.\n  Each piece of ruddy fat, which in their shell bumps up, emits a\n      fragrant smell.\n  Besides much meat, they have a greater relish for me still, eight feet\n      as well.\n  Who bids me drink a thousand cups of wine in order to enhance my joy?\n  What time I can behold their luscious food, with the fine season doth\n      accord\n  When cassias wave with fragrance pure, and the chrysanthemums are\n      decked with frost.",
        "Pao-yü had just finished conning it over and was beginning to sing its\npraise, when Tai-yü, with one snatch, tore it to pieces and bade a\nservant go and burn it.",
        "“As my compositions can’t come up to yours,” she then observed, “I’ll\nburn it. Yours is capital, much better than the lines you wrote a little\ntime back on the chrysanthemums, so keep it for the benefit of others.”",
        "“I’ve likewise succeeded, after much effort, in putting together a\nstanza,” Pao-ch’ai laughingly remarked. “It cannot, of course, be worth\nmuch, but I’ll put it down for fun’s sake.”",
        "As she spoke, she too wrote down her lines. When they came to look at\nthem, they read–",
        "  On this bright beauteous day, I bask in the dryandra shade, with a cup\n      in my hand.\n  When I was at Ch’ang An, with drivelling mouth, I longed for the ninth\n      day of the ninth moon.\n  The road stretches before their very eyes, but they can’t tell between\n      straight and transverse.\n  Under their shells in spring and autumn only reigns a vacuum, yellow\n      and black.",
        "At this point, they felt unable to refrain from shouting: “Excellent!\"\n“She abuses in fine style!” Pao-yü shouted. “But my lines should also be\ncommitted to the flames.”",
        "The company thereupon scanned the remainder of the stanza, which was\ncouched in this wise:",
        "  When all the stock of wine is gone, chrysanthemums then use to scour\n      away the smell.\n  So as to counteract their properties of gath’ring cold, fresh ginger\n      you should take.\n  Alas! now that they have been dropped into the boiling pot, what good\n      do they derive?\n  About the moonlit river banks there but remains the fragrant aroma of\n      corn.",
        "At the close of their perusal, they with one voice, explained that this\nwas a first-rate song on crab-eating; that minor themes of this kind\nshould really conceal lofty thoughts, before they could be held to be of\nany great merit, and that the only thing was that it chaffed people\nrather too virulently.",
        "But while they were engaged in conversation, P’ing Erh was again seen\ncoming into the garden. What she wanted is not, however, yet known; so,\nreader, peruse the details given in the subsequent chapter.",
