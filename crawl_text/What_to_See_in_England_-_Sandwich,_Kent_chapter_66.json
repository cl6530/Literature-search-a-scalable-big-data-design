        "It is difficult to realise that Sandwich, now 1-1/2 miles from the\ncoast, was yet once situated on the sea, and was the second in\nimportance of the Cinque Ports. In Roman and early Saxon times a wide\narm of the Thames, called the Wantsume, flowed from Reculver (then known\nas Regulbium), where it was a mile wide, southwards to what is now the\nmouth of the Stour. Between Ebbsfleet and Worth it was over 4 miles\nwide. The Roman fortress of Ritupiae (Richborough) guarded it on the\nsouth, and the river Stour flowed into it at Stourmouth. This stream\ncaused so much alluvial deposit that the sea receded from Richborough in\nearly Saxon times, and part of the population removed to Sandwich. The\nrepeated attacks by the Danes and the French did not check the growth of\nthe town, which attained its maximum prosperity in Edward IV.’s reign,\nwhen it was walled. But the sea left its shores, and the town declined\nto again rise in importance, when the 400 Flemish emigrants settled\nthere in Elizabeth’s reign and introduced silk-weaving, flannel\nmanufactures, and market-gardening.",
        "Sandwich contains some of the richest bits of mediaeval architecture in\nEngland. There are some traces of the walls to be seen, and one ancient\ngateway is perfect, Fisher’s Gate, near the quay. On the north is the\nTudor barbican gate. St. Clement’s Church possesses a central Norman\ntower. The nave is in the Perpendicular style, and the chancel is\nDecorated. Both have fine roofs. St. Peter’s Church (thirteenth century)\nhas a tower, but its south aisle was destroyed in 1661. The session-room\nat the town hall has some curious seats for the mayor and aldermen, and\nthe hospital of St. Bartholomew’s has an Early English chapel. The best\nof the ancient houses in the town are in Strand Street and Lucksboat\nStreet. Manswood Grammar School dates from 1564, and has a Flemish\nfront.",
        "At Richborough can be seen some Roman rectangular walls about 10 feet\nhigh, with a subterranean concrete building in the centre.",
