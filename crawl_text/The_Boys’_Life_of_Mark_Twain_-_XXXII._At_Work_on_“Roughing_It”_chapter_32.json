        "The Clemens family now went to Elmira, to Quarry Farm–a beautiful\nhilltop place, overlooking the river and the town–the home of Mrs.\nClemens’s sister, Mrs. Theodore Crane.  They did not expect to return to\nBuffalo, and the house there was offered for sale.  For them the sunlight\nhad gone out of it.",
        "Matters went better at Quarry Farm.  The invalids gained strength; work\non the book progressed.  The Clemenses that year fell in love with the\nplace that was to mean so much to them in the many summers to come.",
        "Mark Twain was not altogether satisfied, however, with his writing.  He\nwas afraid it was not up to his literary standard.  His spirits were at\nlow ebb when his old first editor, Joe Goodman, came East and stopped off\nat Elmira.  Clemens hurried him out to the farm, and, eagerly putting the\nchapters of “Roughing It” into his hands, asked him to read them.\nGoodman seated himself comfortably by a window, while the author went\nover to a table and pretended to write, but was really watching Goodman,\nwho read page after page solemnly and with great deliberation.  Presently\nMark Twain could stand it no longer.  He threw down his pen, exclaiming:",
        "“I knew it!  I knew it!  I’ve been writing nothing but rot.  You have sat\nthere all this time reading without a smile–but I am not wholly to\nblame.  I have been trying to write a funny book with dead people and\nsickness everywhere.  Oh, Joe, I wish I could die myself!”",
        "“Mark,” said Goodman, “I was reading critically, not for amusement, and\nso far as I have read, and can judge, this is one of the best things you\nhave ever written.  I have found it perfectly absorbing.  You are doing a\ngreat book!”",
        "That was enough.  Clemens knew that Goodman never spoke idly of such\nmatters.  The author of “Roughing It” was a changed man–full of\nenthusiasm, eager to go on.  He offered to pay Goodman a salary to stay\nand furnish inspiration.  Goodman declined the salary, but remained for\nseveral weeks, and during long walks which the two friends took over the\nhills gave advice, recalled good material, and was a great help and\ncomfort.  In May, Clemens wrote to Bliss that he had twelve hundred\nmanuscript pages of the new book written and was turning out from thirty\nto sixty-five per day.  He was in high spirits.  The family health had\nimproved–once more prospects were bright.  He even allowed Redpath to\npersuade him to lecture again during the coming season.  Selling his\nshare of the “Express” at a loss had left Mark Twain considerably in debt\nand lecture profits would furnish the quickest means of payment.",
        "When the summer ended the Clemens family took up residence in Hartford,\nConnecticut, in the fine old Hooker house, on Forest Street.  Hartford\nheld many attractions for Mark Twain.  His publishers were located there,\nalso it was the home of a distinguished group of writers, and of the Rev.\n“Joe” Twichell.  Neither Clemens nor his wife had felt that they could\nreturn to Buffalo.  The home there was sold–its contents packed and\nshipped.  They did not see it again.",
        "His book finished, Mark Twain lectured pretty steadily that winter, often\nin the neighborhood of Boston, which was lecture headquarters.  Mark\nTwain enjoyed Boston.  In Redpath’s office one could often meet and “swap\nstories” with Josh Billings (Henry W. Shaw) and Petroleum V. Nasby (David\nR. Locke)–well-known humorists of that day–while in the strictly\nliterary circle there were William Dean Howells, Thomas Bailey Aldrich,\nBret Harte (who by this time had become famous and journeyed eastward),\nand others of their sort.  They were all young and eager and merry, then,\nand they gathered at luncheons in snug corners and talked gaily far into\nthe dimness of winter afternoons.  Harte had been immediately accorded a\nhigh place in the Boston group.  Mark Twain as a strictly literary man\nwas still regarded rather doubtfully by members of the older set–the\nBrahmins, as they were called–but the young men already hailed him\njoyfully, reveling in the fine, fearless humor of his writing, his\nwonderful talk, his boundless humanity.",
