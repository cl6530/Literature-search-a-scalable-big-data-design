        "Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into\npartnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;\nthey lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add\nconsiderably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into\nthe wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the\nsausage saw to the cooking.",
        "When people are too well off they always begin to long for something\nnew. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a\nfellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his\nhousehold arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a\npoor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed\nat home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the\nfire and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room\nand rest until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to\nwatch the pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it\nwas near dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled\nin and out among the vegetables three or four times, and there they\nwere, buttered, and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the\nbird came home and had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table,\nand when they had finished their meal, they could sleep their fill\ntill the following morning: and that was really a very delightful\nlife.",
        "Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in\nthe wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long\nenough, and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time\nto make a change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg\nand pray as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the\nbird remained master of the situation, and the venture had to be made.\nThey therefore drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the\nwood, to the mouse to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.",
        "And now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird\nmade the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited\ntill the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the\nsausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird\nflew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came\nacross a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his\nlegitimate booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained\nto the dog of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any\navail, for the dog answered that he found false credentials on the\nsausage, and that was the reason his life had been forfeited.",
        "He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he\nhad seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make\nthe best of things and to remain with one another.",
        "So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food\nand, wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling\nin and out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped\ninto the pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the\nbottom, having already parted not only with her skin and hair, but\nalso with life.",
        "Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he\ncould nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood\nhere and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was\nto be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown\ndown, caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some\nwater, but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was\nunable to recover himself, he was drowned.",
