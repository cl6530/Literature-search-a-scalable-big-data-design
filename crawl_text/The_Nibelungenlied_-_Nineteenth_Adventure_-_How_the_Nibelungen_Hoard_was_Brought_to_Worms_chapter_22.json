        "When that the noble Kriemhild / thus did widowed stand,\nRemained there with his warriors / by her in that land\nEckewart the margrave, / and served her ever true.\nAnd he did help his mistress / oft to mourn his master too.",
        "1102",
        "At Worms a house they built her / the minster high beside,\nThat was both rich and spacious, / full long and eke full wide,\nWherein with her attendants / joyless did she dwell.\nShe sought the minster gladly, / –that to do she loved full well.",
        "1103",
        "Seldom undone she left it, / but thither went alway\nIn sorry mood where buried / her loved husband lay.\nGod begged she in his mercy / his soul in charge to keep,\nAnd, to the thane right faithful, / for him full often did she weep.",
        "1104",
        "Ute and her attendants / all times a comfort bore,\nBut yet her heart was stricken / and wounded all so sore\nThat no whit might avail it / what solace e’er they brought.\nFor lover taken from her / with such grief her heart was fraught,",
        "1105",
        "As ne’er for spouse beloved / a wife did ever show.\nThereby how high in virtue / she stood ye well might know.\nShe mourned until her ending / and while did last her life.\nAnon a mighty vengeance / wreaked the valiant Siegfried’s wife.",
        "1106",
        "And so such load of sorrow / for her dead spouse she bore,\nThe story sayeth truly, / for years full three or more,\nNor ever unto Gunther / any word spake she,\nAnd meantime eke her enemy / Hagen never might she see.",
        "1107",
        "Then spake of Tronje Hagen: / “Now seek’st thou such an end,\nThat unto thee thy sister / be well-disposed friend?\nThen Nibelungen treasure / let come to this country:\nThereof thou much might’st win thee, / might Kriemhild friendly-minded\n      be.”",
        "1108",
        "He spake: “Be that our effort. / My brothers’ love hath she:\nThem shall we beg to win her / that she our friend may be,\nAnd that she gladly see it / that we do share her store.\"\n“I trow it well,” spake Hagen, / “may such thing be nevermore.”",
        "1109",
        "Then did he Ortwein / unto the court command\nAnd the margrave Gere. / When both were found at hand,\nThither brought they Gernot / and eke young Giselher.\nIn friendly manner sought they / to win the Lady Kriemhild there.",
        "1110",
        "Then spake of Burgundy / Gernot the warrior strong:\n“Lady, the death of Siegfried / thou mournest all too long.\nWell will the monarch prove thee / that him he ne’er hath slain.\n’Tis heard how that right sorely / thou dost for him unending plain.”",
        "1111",
        "She spake: “The king none chargeth: / t’was Hagen’s hand that slew.\nWhen Hagen me did question / where might one pierce him through,\nHow might e’er thought come to me / that hate his heart did bear?\nThen ’gainst such thing to guard me,\" / spake she, “had I ta’en good\n      care.",
        "1112",
        "“And kept me from betraying / to evil hands his life,\nNor cause of this my weeping / had I his poor lorn wife.\nMy heart shall hate forever / who this foul deed have done.\"\nAnd further to entreat her / young Giselher had soon begun.",
        "1113",
        "When that to greet the monarch / a willing mind spake she,\nHim soon with noble kinsmen / before her might ye see.\nYet dare might never Hagen / unto her to go:\nOn her he’d wrought sore evil, / as well his guilty mind did know.",
        "1114",
        "When she no hatred meted / unto Gunther as before,\nBy Hagen to be greeted / were fitting all the more.\nHad but by his counsel / no ill to her been done,\nSo might he all undaunted / unto Kriemhild have gone.",
        "1115",
        "Nor e’er was peace new offered / kindred friends among\nSealed with tears so many. / She brooded o’er her wrong.\nTo all she gave her friendship / save to one man alone.\nNor slain her spouse were ever, / were not the deed by Hagen done.",
        "1116",
        "Small time it was thereafter / ere they did bring to pass\nThat with the Lady Kriemhild / the mighty treasure was,\nThat from Nibelungen country / she brought the Rhine unto.\nIt was her bridal portion / and ’twas fairly now her due.",
        "1117",
        "For it did journey thither / Gernot and Giselher.\nWarriors eighty hundred / Kriemhild commanded there\nThat they should go and fetch it / where hidden it did lie,\nAnd where the good thane Alberich / with friends did guard it faithfully.",
        "1118",
        "When saw they coming warriors / from Rhine the hoard to take,\nAlberich the full valiant / to his friends in this wise spake:\n“We dare not of the treasure / aught from them withhold:\nIt is her bridal portion, / –thus the noble queen hath told.",
        "1119",
        "“Yet had we never granted,\" / spake Alberich, “this to do,\nBut that in evil manner / the sightless mantle too\nWith the doughty Siegfried / we alike did lose,\nThe which did wear at all times / the fair Kriemhild’s noble spouse.",
        "1120",
        "“Now alas hath Siegfried / had but evil gain\nThat from us the sightless mantle / the hero thus hath ta’en,\nAnd so hath forced to serve him / all these lands around.\"\nThen went forth the porter / where full soon the keys he found.",
        "1121",
        "There stood before the mountain / ready Kriemhild’s men,\nAnd her kinsmen with them. / The treasure bore they then\nDown unto the water / where the ships they sought:\nTo where the Rhine flowed downward / across the waves the hoard they\n      brought.",
        "1122",
        "Now of the treasure further / may ye a wonder hear:\nHeavy wains a dozen / scarce the same might bear\nIn four days and nights together / from the mountain all away,\nE’en did each one of them / thrice the journey make each day.",
        "1123",
        "In it was nothing other / than gold and jewels rare.\nAnd if to every mortal / on earth were dealt a share,\nNe’er ’twould make the treasure / by one mark the less.\nNot without good reason / forsooth would Hagen it possess.",
        "1124",
        "The wish-rod lay among them, / of gold a little wand.\nWhosoe’er its powers / full might understand,\nThe same might make him master / o’er all the race of men.\nOf Alberich’s kin full many / with Gernot returned again.",
        "1125",
        "When they did store the treasure / in King Gunther’s land,\nAnd to royal Kriemhild / ’twas given ’neath her hand,\nStoring-rooms and towers / could scarce the measure hold.\nNevermore such wonder / might of wealth again be told.",
        "1126",
        "And had it e’en been greater, / yea a thousandfold,\nIf but again might Kriemhild / safe her Siegfried hold,\nFain were she empty-handed / of all the boundless store.\nSpouse than she more faithful / won a hero nevermore.",
        "1127",
        "When now she had the treasure, / she brought into that land\nKnights many from far distance. / Yea, dealt the lady’s hand\nSo freely that such bounty / ne’er before was seen.\nHigh in honor held they / for her goodly heart the queen.",
        "1128",
        "Unto both rich and needy / began she so to give\nThat fearful soon grew Hagen, / if that she would live\nLong time in such high power, / lest she of warriors true\nSuch host might win to serve her, / that cause would be her strength to\n      rue.",
        "1129",
        "Spake Gunther then: / “The treasure is hers and freedom too.\nWherefore shall I prevent her, / whate’er therewith she do?\nYea, nigh she did her friendship / from me evermore withhold.\nNow reck we not who shareth / or her silver or her gold.”",
        "1130",
        "Unto the king spake Hagen: / “No man that boasteth wit\nShould to any woman / such hoard to hold permit.\nBy gifts she yet will bring it / that will come the day\nWhen valiant men of Burgundy / rue it with good reason may.”",
        "1131",
        "Then spake the monarch Gunther: / “To her an oath I swore,\nThat I would cause of evil / to her be nevermore,\nWhereof henceforth I’ll mind me: / sister she is to me.\"\nThen spake further Hagen: / “Let me bear the guilt for thee.”",
        "1132",
        "Many they were that kept not / there their plighted word:\nFrom the widow took they / all that mighty hoard:\nEvery key had Hagen / known to get in hand.\nRage filled her brother Gernot / when he the thing did understand.",
        "1133",
        "Then spake the knight Giselher: / “Hagen here hath wrought\nSore evil to my sister: / permit this thing I’ll not.\nAnd were he not my kinsman, / he’d pay it with his life.\"\nAnew did fall aweeping / then the doughty Siegfried’s wife.",
        "1134",
        "Then spake the knight Gernot: / “Ere that forever we\nBe troubled with this treasure, / let first commanded be\nDeep in the Rhine to sink it, / that no man have it more.\"\nIn sad manner plaining / Kriemhild stood Giselher before.",
        "1135",
        "She spake: “Beloved brother, / be mindful thou of me:\nWhat life and treasure toucheth / shalt thou my protector be.\"\nThen spake he to the lady: / “That shall sure betide,\nWhen we again come hither: / now called we are away to ride.”",
        "1136",
        "The monarch and his kinsmen / rode from out the land,\nAnd in his train the bravest / ye saw on any hand:\nWent all save Hagen only, / and there he stayed for hate,\nThat he did bear to Kriemhild, / and full gladly did he that.",
        "1137",
        "Ere that the mighty monarch / was thither come again,\nIn that while had Hagen / all that treasure ta’en.\nWhere Loch is by the river / all in the Rhine sank he.\nHe weened thereof to profit, / yet such thing might never be.",
        "1138",
        "The royal knights came thither / again with many a man.\nKriemhild with her maidens / and ladies then began\nTo mourn the wrong they suffered, / that pity was to hear.\nFain had the faithful Giselher / been unto her a comforter.",
        "1139",
        "Then spake they all together: / “Done hath he grievous wrong.\"\nBut he the princes’ anger / avoided yet so long\nAt last to win their favor. / They let him live sans scathe.\nThen filled thereat was Kriemhild / as ne’er before with mickle wrath.",
        "1140",
        "Ere that of Tronje Hagen / had hidden thus the hoard,\nHad they unto each other / given firm plighted word,\nThat it should lie concealed / while one of them might live.\nThereof anon nor could they / to themselves nor unto other give.",
        "1141",
        "With renewed sorrows / heavy she was of heart\nThat so her dear-loved husband / perforce from life must part,\nAnd that of wealth they reft her. / Therefor she mourned alway,\nNor ever ceased her plaining / until was come her latest day.",
        "1142",
        "After the death of Siegfried / dwelt she in sorrow then,\n–Saith the tale all truly– / full three years and ten,\nNor in that time did ever / for the knight mourn aught the less.\nTo him she was right faithful, / must all the folk of her confess.",
