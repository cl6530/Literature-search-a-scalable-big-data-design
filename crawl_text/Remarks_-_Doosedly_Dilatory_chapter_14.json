        "Since the investigation of Washington pension attorneys, it is a little\nremarkable how scarce in the newspapers is the appearance of\nadvertisements like this.",
        "Pensions! Thousands of soldiers of the late war are still entitled to\npensions with the large accumulations since the injury was received. We\nprocure pensions, back pay, allowances. Appear in the courts for\nnonresident clients in United States land cases, etc. Address Skinnem &\nCo., Washington, D.C.",
        "I didn’t participate in the late war, but I have had some experience in\nputting a few friends and neighbors on the track of a pension. Those who\nhave tried it will remember some of the details. It always seemed to me a\nlittle more difficult somehow for a man who had lost both legs at\nAntietam, than for the man who got his nose pulled off at an election\nthree years after the war closed. It, of course, depended a good deal on\nthe extemporaneous affidavit qualifications of the applicant. About five\nyears ago an acquaintance came to me and said he wanted to get a pension\nfrom the government, and that he hadn’t the first idea about the details.\nHe didn’t know whether he should apply to the President or to the\nSecretary of State. Would I “kind of put him onto the racket.” I asked him\nwhat he wanted a pension for, and he said his injury didn’t show much, but\nit prevented his pursuit of kopecks and happiness. He had nine children by\nhis first wife, and if he could get a pension he desired to marry again.",
        "As to the nature of his injuries, he said that at the battle of Fair Oaks\nhe supported his command by secreting himself behind a rail fence and\nharassing the enemy from time to time, by a system of coldness and neglect\non his part. While thus employed in breaking the back of the Confederacy,\na solid shot struck a crooked rail on which he was sitting, in such a way\nas to jar his spinal column. From this concussion he had never fully\nrecovered. He didn’t notice it any more while sitting down and quiet, but\nthe moment he began to do manual labor or to stand on his feet too long,\nunless he had a bar or something to lean up against, he felt the cold\nchill run up his back and life was no object.",
        "I told him that I was too busy to attend to it, and asked him why he\ndidn’t put his case in the hands of some Washington attorney, who could be\non the ground and attend to it. He decided that he would, so he wrote to\none of these philanthropists whom we will call Fitznoodle. I give him the\nnom de plume of Fitznoodle to nip a $20,000 libel suit in the bud. Well,\nFitznoodle sent back some blanks for the claimant to sign, by which he\nbound himself, his heirs, executors, representatives and assigns, firmly\nby these presents to pay to said Fitznoodle, the necessary fees for\npostage, stationery, car fare, concert tickets, and office rent, while\nsaid claim was in the hands of the pension department. He said in a letter\nthat he would have to ask for $2, please, to pay for postage. He inclosed\na circular in which he begged to refer the claimant to a reformed member\nof the bar of the District of Columbia, a backslidden foreign minister and\nthree prominent men who had been dead eleven years by the watch. In a\npostscript he again alluded to the $2 in a casual way, waved the American\nflag two times, and begged leave to subscribe himself once more. “Yours\nFraternally and professionally, Good Samaritan Fitznoodle, Attorney at\nLaw, Solicitor in Chancery, and Promotor of Even-handed Justice in and for\nthe District of Columbia.” The claimant sent his $2, not necessarily for\npublication, but as a guaranty of good faith.",
        "Later on Mr. Fitznoodle said that the first step would be to file a\ndeclaration enclosing $5 and the names of two witnesses who were present\nwhen the claimant was born, and could identify him as the same man who\nenlisted from Emporia in the Thirteenth Kansas Nighthawks. Five dollars\nmust be enclosed to defray the expenses of a trip to the office of the\ncommissioner of pensions, which trip would naturally take in eleven\nsaloons and ten cents in car fare. “P.S.–Attach to the declaration the\nsignature and seal of a notary public of pure character, $5, the\ncertificate of the clerk of a court of record as to the genuineness of\nthe signature of the notary public, his term of appointment and $5.\"\nThese documents were sent, after which there was a lull of about three\nmonths. Then the swelling in Mr. Fitznoodle’s head had gone down a\nlittle, but there was still a seal brown taste in his mouth. So he wrote\nthe claimant that it would be necessary to jog the memory of the\ndepartment about $3 dollars worth; and to file collateral testimony\nsetting forth that claimant was a native born American or that he had\ndeclared his intention to become a citizen of the United States, that he\nhad not formed nor expressed an opinion for or against the accused, which\nthe testimony would not eradicate, that he would enclose $3, and that he\nhad never before applied for a pension. After awhile a circular from the\npension end of the department was received, stating that the claimant’s\napplication had been received, filed and docketed No. 188,935,062-1/2, on\npage 9,847 of book G, on the thumb-hand side as you come in on the New\nYork train. On the strength of this document the claimant went to the\ngrocery and bought an ecru-colored ham, a sack of corn meal and a pound\nof tobacco. In June Mr. Fitznoodle sent a blank to be filled out by the\nclaimant, stating whether he had or had not been baptized prior to his\nenlistment; and, if so, to what extent, and how he liked it so far as he\nhad gone. This was to be sworn to before two witnesses, who were to be\nmale, if possible, and if not, the department would insist on their being\nfemale. These witnesses must swear that they had no interest in the said\nclaim, or anything else. On receipt of this, together with $5 in\npostoffice money order or New York draft, the document would be filed\nand, no doubt, acted upon at once. In July, a note came from the attorney\nsaying that he regretted to write that the pension department was now\n250,000 claims behind, and if business was taken up in its regular order,\nthe claim under discussion might not be reached for between nine and ten\nyears. However, it would be possible to “expedite” the claim, if $25\ncould be remitted for the purpose of buying a spike-tail coat and plug\nhat, in which to appear before the commissioner of pensions and mash him\nflat on the shape of the attorney. As the claimant didn’t know much of\nthe practical working of the machinery of government, he swallowed this\npill and remitted the $25. Here followed a good deal of red tape and\ninternational monkeying during which the claimant was alternately taking\nan oath to support the constitution of the United States, and promising\nto support the constitution and by-laws of Mr. Fitznoodle. The claimant\nwas constantly assured that his claim was a good one and on these\nautograph letters written with a type-writer, the war-born veteran with a\nconcussed vertebra bought groceries and secured the funds to pay his\nassessments.",
        "For a number of years I heard nothing of the claim, but a few months ago,\nwhen Mr. Fitznoodle was arrested and jerked into the presence of the grand\njury, a Washington friend wrote me that the officers found in his table a\nletter addressed to the man who was jarred in the rear of the Union army,\nand in which (the letter, I mean), he alluded to the long and pleasant\ncorrespondence which had sprung up between them as lawyer and client, and\nregretting that, as the claim would soon be allowed, their friendly\nrelations would no doubt cease, would he please forward $13 to pay freight\non the pension money, and also a lock of his hair that Mr. Fitznoodle\ncould weave into a watchchain and wear always. As the claimant does not\nneed the papers, he probably thinks by this time that Mr. Good Samaritan\nFitznoodle has been kidnapped and thrown into the moaning, hungry sea.",
