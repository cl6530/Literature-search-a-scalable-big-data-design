        "SUPPOSING that Truth is a woman—what then? Is there not ground\nfor suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have been\ndogmatists, have failed to understand women—that the terrible\nseriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually\npaid their addresses to Truth, have been unskilled and unseemly\nmethods for winning a woman? Certainly she has never allowed\nherself to be won; and at present every kind of dogma stands with\nsad and discouraged mien—IF, indeed, it stands at all! For there\nare scoffers who maintain that it has fallen, that all dogma lies\non the ground—nay more, that it is at its last gasp. But to\nspeak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping that all\ndogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive\nand decided airs it has assumed, may have been only a noble\npuerilism and tyronism; and probably the time is at hand when it\nwill be once and again understood WHAT has actually sufficed for\nthe basis of such imposing and absolute philosophical edifices as\nthe dogmatists have hitherto reared: perhaps some popular\nsuperstition of immemorial time (such as the soul-superstition,\nwhich, in the form of subject- and ego-superstition, has not yet\nceased doing mischief): perhaps some play upon words, a deception\non the part of grammar, or an audacious generalization of very\nrestricted, very personal, very human—all-too-human facts. The\nphilosophy of the dogmatists, it is to be hoped, was only a\npromise for thousands of years afterwards, as was astrology in\nstill earlier times, in the service of which probably more\nlabour, gold, acuteness, and patience have been spent than on any\nactual science hitherto: we owe to it, and to its “super-\nterrestrial” pretensions in Asia and Egypt, the grand style of\narchitecture. It seems that in order to inscribe themselves upon\nthe heart of humanity with everlasting claims, all great things\nhave first to wander about the earth as enormous and awe-\ninspiring caricatures: dogmatic philosophy has been a caricature\nof this kind—for instance, the Vedanta doctrine in Asia, and\nPlatonism in Europe. Let us not be ungrateful to it, although it\nmust certainly be confessed that the worst, the most tiresome,\nand the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist\nerror—namely, Plato’s invention of Pure Spirit and the Good in\nItself. But now when it has been surmounted, when Europe, rid of\nthis nightmare, can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a\nhealthier—sleep, we, WHOSE DUTY IS WAKEFULNESS ITSELF, are the\nheirs of all the strength which the struggle against this error\nhas fostered. It amounted to the very inversion of truth, and the\ndenial of the PERSPECTIVE—the fundamental condition—of life, to\nspeak of Spirit and the Good as Plato spoke of them; indeed one\nmight ask, as a physician: “How did such a malady attack that\nfinest product of antiquity, Plato? Had the wicked Socrates\nreally corrupted him? Was Socrates after all a corrupter of\nyouths, and deserved his hemlock?” But the struggle against\nPlato, or—to speak plainer, and for the “people\"—the struggle\nagainst the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of\nChristianity (FOR CHRISITIANITY IS PLATONISM FOR THE “PEOPLE”),\nproduced in Europe a magnificent tension of soul, such as had not\nexisted anywhere previously; with such a tensely strained bow one\ncan now aim at the furthest goals. As a matter of fact, the\nEuropean feels this tension as a state of distress, and twice\nattempts have been made in grand style to unbend the bow: once by\nmeans of Jesuitism, and the second time by means of democratic\nenlightenment—which, with the aid of liberty of the press and\nnewspaper-reading, might, in fact, bring it about that the spirit\nwould not so easily find itself in “distress”! (The Germans\ninvented gunpowder-all credit to them! but they again made things\nsquare—they invented printing.) But we, who are neither Jesuits,\nnor democrats, nor even sufficiently Germans, we GOOD EUROPEANS,\nand free, VERY free spirits—we have it still, all the distress\nof spirit and all the tension of its bow! And perhaps also the\narrow, the duty, and, who knows? THE GOAL TO AIM AT. . . .",
