        "Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of\nher had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how\nunwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and\nwas curious to know with how much civility on that lady’s side\nthe acquaintance would now be renewed.",
        "On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into\nthe saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for\nsummer.  Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most\nrefreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house,\nand of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were\nscattered over the intermediate lawn.",
        "In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was\nsitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady\nwith whom she lived in London.  Georgiana’s reception of them\nwas very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which,\nthough proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong,\nwould easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the\nbelief of her being proud and reserved.  Mrs. Gardiner and her\nniece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.",
        "By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a\ncurtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such\npauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.  It was\nfirst broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking\nwoman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse\nproved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others;\nand between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on.  Miss Darcy looked\nas if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes\ndid venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its\nbeing heard.",
        "Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss\nBingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss\nDarcy, without calling her attention.  This observation would not\nhave prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they\nnot been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry\nto be spared the necessity of saying much.  Her own thoughts\nwere employing her.  She expected every moment that some of the\ngentlemen would enter the room.  She wished, she feared that\nthe master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.\nAfter sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing\nMiss Bingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from\nher a cold inquiry after the health of her family.  She answered\nwith equal indifference and brevity, and the others said no more.",
        "The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by\nthe entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of\nall the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till\nafter many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to\nMiss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post.  There was\nnow employment for the whole party–for though they could not all\ntalk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes,\nnectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.",
        "While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding\nwhether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.\nDarcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room;\nand then, though but a moment before she had believed her\nwishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.",
        "He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or\nthree other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river,\nand had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family\nintended a visit to Georgiana that morning.  No sooner did he\nappear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and\nunembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but\nperhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the\nsuspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and\nthat there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his\nbehaviour when he first came into the room.  In no countenance\nwas attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s,\nin spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she\nspoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her\ndesperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means\nover.  Miss Darcy, on her brother’s entrance, exerted herself\nmuch more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for\nhis sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much\nas possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.  Miss\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger,\ntook the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:",
        "“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ––shire Militia removed from\nMeryton?  They must be a great loss to your family.”",
        "In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name;\nbut Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in\nher thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him\ngave her a moment’s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to\nrepel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question\nin a tolerably detached tone.  While she spoke, an involuntary\nglance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion,\nearnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion,\nand unable to lift up her eyes.  Had Miss Bingley known what\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly\nwould have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended\nto discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man\nto whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility\nwhich might injure her in Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to\nremind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which\nsome part of her family were connected with that corps.  Not a\nsyllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s meditated\nelopement.  To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s\nconnections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it,\nfrom the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to\nhim, of their becoming hereafter her own.  He had certainly\nformed such a plan, and without meaning that it should effect\nhis endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable\nthat it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare\nof his friend.",
        "Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his\nemotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared\nnot approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in\ntime, though not enough to be able to speak any more.  Her\nbrother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her\ninterest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had\nbeen designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to\nhave fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.",
        "Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer\nabove mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to\ntheir carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms\non Elizabeth’s person, behaviour, and dress.  But Georgiana\nwould not join her.  Her brother’s recommendation was enough\nto ensure her favour; his judgement could not err.  And he had\nspoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without\nthe power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.\nWhen Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help\nrepeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his\nsister.",
        "“How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\"\nshe cried; “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she\nis since the winter.  She is grown so brown and coarse!  Louisa\nand I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.”",
        "However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he\ncontented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no\nother alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous\nconsequence of travelling in the summer.",
        "“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never\ncould see any beauty in her.  Her face is too thin; her\ncomplexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all\nhandsome.  Her nose wants character–there is nothing marked\nin its lines.  Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common\nway; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so\nfine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them.  They\nhave a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her\nair altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which\nis intolerable.”",
        "Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth,\nthis was not the best method of recommending herself; but\nangry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look\nsomewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.  He was\nresolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making\nhim speak, she continued:",
        "“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how\namazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I\nparticularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been\ndining at Netherfield, ’She a beauty!–I should as soon call her\nmother a wit.’  But afterwards she seemed to improve on you,\nand I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.”",
        "“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer,\n“but that was only when I first saw her, for it is many months\nsince I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of\nmy acquaintance.”",
        "He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the\nsatisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any\npain but herself.",
        "Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during\ntheir visit, as they returned, except what had particularly\ninterested them both.  The look and behaviour of everybody they\nhad seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly\nengaged their attention.  They talked of his sister, his friends,\nhis house, his fruit–of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth\nwas longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs.\nGardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s beginning\nthe subject.",
