        "In the study of primitive religion, the analogy existing between\nthe growth of the god-idea and the development of the human race,\nand especially of the two sex-principles, is everywhere clearly\napparent.",
        "“Religion is to be found alone with its justification and\nexplanation in the relations of the sexes.  There and therein\nonly.\"[3]",
        "[3] Hargrave Jennings, Phallicism.",
        "As the conception of a deity originated in sex, or in the\ncreative agencies female and male which animate Nature, we may\nreasonably expect to find, in the history of the development of\nthe two sex-principles and in the notions entertained concerning\nthem throughout past ages, a tolerably correct account of the\ngrowth of the god-idea.  We shall perceive that during an earlier\nage of human existence, not only were the reproductive powers\nthroughout Nature, and especially in human beings and in animals,\nvenerated as the Creator, but we shall find also that the\nprevailing ideas relative to the importance of either sex in the\noffice of reproduction decided the sex of this universal creative\nforce.  We shall observe also that the ideas of a god have always\ncorresponded with the current opinions regarding the importance\nof either sex in human society.  In other words, so long as\nfemale power and influence were in the ascendency, the creative\nforce was regarded as embodying the principles of the female\nnature; later, however, when woman’s power waned, and the\nsupremacy of man was gained, the god-idea began gradually to\nassume the male characters and attributes.",
        "Through scientific research the fact has been observed that, for\nages after life appeared on the earth, the male had no separate\nexistence; that the two sex-principles, the sperm and the germ,\nwere contained within one and the same individual.  Through the\nprocesses of differentiation, however, these elements became\ndetached, and with the separation of the male from the female,\nthe reproductive functions were henceforth confided to two\nseparate individuals.",
        "As originally, throughout Nature, the female was the visible\norganic unit within whom was contained the exclusive creative\npower, and as throughout the earlier ages of life on the earth\nshe comprehended the male, it is not perhaps singular that, even\nafter the appearance of mankind on the earth, the greater\nimportance of the mother element in human society should have\nbeen recognized; nor, as the power to bring forth coupled with\nperceptive wisdom originally constituted the Creator, that the\ngod-idea should have been female instead of male.",
        "From the facts to be observed in relation to this subject, it is\naltogether probable that for ages the generating principle\nthroughout Nature was venerated as female; but with that increase\nof knowledge which was the result of observation and experience,\njuster or more correct ideas came to prevail, and subsequently\nthe great fructifying energy throughout the universe came to be\nregarded as a dual indivisible force–female and male.  This\nforce, or agency, constituted one God, which, as woman’s\nfunctions in those ages were accounted of more importance than\nthose of man, was oftener worshipped under the form of a female\nfigure.",
        "Neith, Minerva, Athene, and Cybele, the most important deities of\ntheir respective countries, were adored as Perceptive Wisdom, or\nLight, while Ceres and others represented Fertility.  With the\nincoming of male dominion and supremacy, however, we observe the\ndesire to annul the importance of the female and to enthrone one\nall-powerful male god whose chief attributes were power and\nmight.",
        "Notwithstanding the efforts which during the historic period have\nbeen put forward to magnify the importance of the male both in\nhuman affairs and in the god-idea, still, no one, I think, can\nstudy the mythologies and traditions of the nations of antiquity\nwithout being impressed with the prominence given to the female\nelement, and the deeper the study the stronger will this\nimpression grow.",
        "During a certain stage of human development, religion was but a\nrecognition of and a reliance upon the vivifying or fructifying\nforces throughout Nature, and in the earlier ages of man’s\ncareer, worship consisted for the most part in the celebration of\nfestivals at stated seasons of the year, notably during seed-time\nand harvest, to commemorate the benefits derived from the grain\nfield and vineyard.",
        "Doubtless the first deified object was Gaia, the Earth.  As\nwithin the bosom of the earth was supposed to reside the\nfructifying, life-giving power, and as from it were received all\nthe bounties of life, it was female.  It was the Universal\nMother, and to her as to no other divinity worshipped by mankind,\nwas offered a spontaneity of devotion and a willing\nacknowledgment of dependence.  Thus far in the history of mankind\nno temples dedicated to an undefined and undefinable God had been\nraised.  The children of Mother Earth met in the open air,\nwithout the precincts of any man-made shrine, and under the\naerial canopy of heaven, acknowledged the bounties of the great\nDeity and their dependence upon her gifts.  She was a beneficent\nand all-wise God, a tender and loving parent–a mother, who\ndemanded no bleeding sacrifice to reconcile her to her children. \nThe ceremonies observed at these festive seasons consisted for\nthe most part in merry-making and in general thanksgiving, in\nwhich the gratitude of the worshippers found expression in song\nand dance, and in invocations to their Deity for a return or\ncontinuance of her gifts.",
        "Subsequently, through the awe and reverence inspired by the\nmysteries involved in birth and life, the adoration of the\ncreative principles in vegetable existence became supplemented by\nthe worship of the creative functions in human beings and in\nanimals.  The earth, including the power inherent in it by which\nthe continuity of existence is maintained, and by which new forms\nare continuously called into life, embodied the idea of God; and,\nas this inner force was regarded as inherent in matter, or as a\nmanifestation of it, in process of time earth and the heavens,\nbody and spirit, came to be worshipped under the form of a mother\nand her child, this figure being the highest expression of a\nCreator which the human mind was able to conceive.  Not only did\nthis emblem represent fertility, or the fecundating energies of\nNature, but with the power to create were combined or correlated\nall the mental qualities and attributes of the two sexes.  In\nfact the whole universe was contained in the Mother idea–the\nchild, which was sometimes female, sometimes male, being a scion\nor offshoot from the eternal or universal unit.",
        "Underlying all ancient mythologies may be observed the idea that\nthe earth, from which all things proceed, is female.  Even in the\nmythology of the Finns, Lapps, and Esths, Mother Earth is the\ndivinity adored.  Tylor calls attention to the same idea in the\nmythology of England,",
        "“from the days when the Anglo-Saxon called upon the Earth, ’Hal\nwes thu folde fira modor’ (Hail, thou Earth, men’s mother), to\nthe time when mediaeval Englishmen made a riddle of her asking\n’Who is Adam’s mother?’ and poetry continued what mythology was\nletting fall, when Milton’s Archangel promised Adam a life to\nlast    \n’.  .  .  till like ripe fruit thou drop          \nInto thy Mother’s lap.’ “[4]",
        "[4] Primitive Culture, vol.  i., p. 295.",
        "In the old religion the sky was the husband of the earth and the\nearth was mother of all the gods.[5] In the traditions of past\nages the fact is clearly perceived that there was a time when the\nmother was not only the one recognized parent on earth, but that\nthe female principle was worshipped as the more important\ncreative force throughout Nature.",
        "[5] Max Muller, Origin and Growth of Religion, p. 279.",
        "Doubtless the worship of the female energy prevailed under the\nmatriarchal system, and was practised at a time when women were\nthe recognized heads of families and when they were regarded as\nthe more important factors in human society.  The fact has been\nshown in a previous work that after women began to leave their\nhomes at marriage, and after property, especially land, had\nfallen under the supervision and control of men, the latter, as\nthey manipulated all the necessaries of life and the means of\nsupplying them, began to regard themselves as superior beings,\nand later, to claim that as a factor in reproduction, or\ncreation, the male was the more important.  With this change the\nideas of a Deity also began to undergo a modification.  The dual\nprinciple necessary to creation, and which had hitherto been\nworshipped as an indivisible unity, began gradually to separate\ninto its individual elements, the male representing spirit, the\nmoving or forming force in the generative processes, the female\nbeing matter–the instrument through which spirit works.  Spirit\nwhich is eternal had produced matter which is destructible.  The\nfact will be observed that this doctrine prevails to a greater or\nless extent in the theologies of the present time.",
        "A little observation and reflection will show us that during this\nchange in the ideas relative to a creative principle, or God,\ndescent and the rights of succession which had hitherto been\nreckoned through the mother were changed from the female to the\nmale line, the father having in the meantime become the only\nrecognized parent.  In the Eumenides of Aeschylus, the plea of\nOrestes in extenuation of his crime is that he is not of kin to\nhis mother.  Euripides, also, puts into the mouth of Apollo the\nsame physiological notion, that she who bears the child is only\nits nurse.  The Hindoo Code of Menu, which, however, since its\nearliest conception, has undergone numberless mutilations to suit\nthe purposes of the priests, declares that “the mother is but the\nfield which brings forth the plant according to whatsoever seed\nis sown.”",
        "Although, through the accumulation of property in masses and the\ncapture of women for wives, men had succeeded in gaining the\nascendancy, and although the doctrine had been propounded that\nthe father is the only parent, thereby reversing the established\nmanner of reckoning descent, still, as we shall hereafter\nobserve, thousands of years were required to eliminate the female\nelement from the god-idea.",
        "We must not lose sight of the fact that human society was first\norganized and held together by means of the gens, at the head of\nwhich was a woman.  The several members of this organization were\nbut parts of one body cemented together by the pure principle of\nmaternity, the chief duty of these members being to defend and\nprotect each other if needs be with their life blood.  The fact\nhas been observed, in an earlier work, that only through the gens\nwas the organization of society possible.  Without it mankind\ncould have accomplished nothing toward its own advancement.",
        "Thus, throughout the earlier ages of human existence, at a time\nwhen mankind lived nearer to Nature and before individual wealth\nand the stimulation of evil passions had engendered superstition,\nselfishness, and distrust, the maternal element constituted not\nonly the binding and preserving principle in human society, but,\ntogether with the power to bring forth, constituted also the\ngod-idea, which idea, as has already been observed, at a certain\nstage in the history of the race was portrayed by a female figure\nwith a child in her arms.",
        "From all sources of information at hand are to be derived\nevidences of the fact that the earliest religion of which we have\nany account was pure Nature-worship, that whatever at any given\ntime might have been the object adored, whether it were the\nearth, a tree, water, or the sun, it was simply as an emblem of\nthe great energizing agency in Nature.  The moving or forming\nforce in the universe constituted the god-idea.  The figure of a\nmother with her child signified not only the power to bring\nforth, but Perceptive Wisdom, or Light, as well.",
        "As through a study of Comparative Ethnology, or through an\ninvestigation into the customs, traditions, and mythoses of\nextant races in the various stages of development, have been\ndiscovered the beginnings of the religious idea and the mental\nqualities which among primitive races prompted worship, so, also,\nthrough extinct tongues and the symbolism used in religious rites\nand ceremonies, many of the processes have been unearthed whereby\nthe original and beautiful conceptions of the Deity, and the\nworship inspired by the operations of Nature, and especially the\ncreative functions in human beings gradually became obscured by\nthe grossest ideas and the vilest practices.  The symbols which\nappear in connection with early religious rites and ceremonies,\nand under which are veiled the conceptions of a still earlier and\npurer age, when compared with subsequently developed notions\nrelative to the same objects, indicate plainly the change which\nhas been wrought in the original ideas relative to the creative\nfunctions, and furnish an index to the direction which human\ndevelopment, or growth, has taken.",
        "As the human race constructs its own gods, and as by the\nconceptions involved in the deities worshipped at any given time\nin the history of mankind we are able to form a correct estimate\nof the character, temperament, and aspirations of the\nworshippers, so the history of the gods of the race, as revealed\nto us through the means of symbols, monumental records, and the\ninvestigation of extinct tongues, proves that from a stage of\nNature worship and a pure and rational conception of the creative\nforces in the universe, mankind, in course of time, degenerated\ninto mere devotees of sensual pleasure.  With the corruption of\nhuman nature and the decline of mental power which followed the\nsupremacy of the animal instincts, the earlier abstract idea of\nGod was gradually lost sight of, and man himself in the form of a\npotentate or ruler, together with the various emblems of\nvirility, came to be worshipped as the Creator.  From adorers of\nan abstract creative principle, mankind had lapsed into\nworshippers of the symbols under which this principle had been\nveiled.",
        "Although at certain stages in the history of the human race the\nevils, which as a result of the supremacy of the ruder elements\ndeveloped in mankind had befallen the race were lamented and\nbewailed, they could not be suppressed.  Man had become a lost\nand ruined creature.  The golden age had passed away.",
