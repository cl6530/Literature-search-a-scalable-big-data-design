        "At the close of the last lecture I reminded you of the first one, in\nwhich I had opposed tough-mindedness to tender-mindedness and\nrecommended pragmatism as their mediator. Tough-mindedness\npositively rejects tender-mindedness’s hypothesis of an eternal\nperfect edition of the universe coexisting with our finite\nexperience.",
        "On pragmatic principles we cannot reject any hypothesis if\nconsequences useful to life flow from it. Universal conceptions, as\nthings to take account of, may be as real for pragmatism as\nparticular sensations are. They have indeed no meaning and no\nreality if they have no use. But if they have any use they have that\namount of meaning. And the meaning will be true if the use squares\nwell with life’s other uses.",
        "Well, the use of the Absolute is proved by the whole course of men’s\nreligious history. The eternal arms are then beneath. Remember\nVivekananda’s use of the Atman: it is indeed not a scientific use,\nfor we can make no particular deductions from it. It is emotional\nand spiritual altogether.",
        "It is always best to discuss things by the help of concrete\nexamples. Let me read therefore some of those verses entitled “To\nYou” by Walt Whitman–\"You” of course meaning the reader or hearer\nof the poem whosoever he or she may be.",
        "Whoever you are, now I place my hand upon you, that you be my poem;\nI whisper with my lips close to your ear,\nI have loved many women and men, but I love none better than you.",
        "O I have been dilatory and dumb;\nI should have made my way straight to you long ago;\nI should have blabb’d nothing but you, I should have chanted nothing\nbut you.",
        "I will leave all, and come and make the hymns of you;\nNone have understood you, but I understand you;\nNone have done justice to you–you have not done justice to\nyourself;\nNone but have found you imperfect–I only find no imperfection in\nyou.",
        "O I could sing such grandeurs and glories about you!\nYou have not known what you are–you have slumber’d upon yourself\nall your life;\nWhat you have done returns already in mockeries.",
        "But the mockeries are not you;\nUnderneath them, and within them, I see you lurk;\nI pursue you where none else has pursued you;\nSilence, the desk, the flippant expression, the night, the\naccustom’d routine, if these conceal you from others, or from\nyourself, they do not conceal you from me;\nThe shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure complexion, if these\nbalk others, they do not balk me,\nThe pert apparel, the deform’d attitude, drunkenness, greed,\npremature death, all these I part aside.",
        "There is no endowment in man or woman that is not tallied in you;\nThere is no virtue, no beauty, in man or woman, but as good is in\nyou;\nNo pluck, no endurance in others, but as good is in you;\nNo pleasure waiting for others, but an equal pleasure waits for you.",
        "Whoever you are! claim your own at any hazard!\nThese shows of the east and west are tame, compared to you;\nThese immense meadows–these interminable rivers–you are immense\nand interminable as they;\nYou are he or she who is master or mistress over them,\nMaster or mistress in your own right over Nature, elements, pain,\npassion, dissolution.",
        "The hopples fall from your ankles–you find an unfailing\nsufficiency;\nOld or young, male or female, rude, low, rejected by the rest,\nwhatever you are promulges itself;\nThrough birth, life, death, burial, the means are provided, nothing\nis scanted;\nThrough angers, losses, ambition, ignorance, ennui, what you are\npicks its way.",
        "Verily a fine and moving poem, in any case, but there are two ways\nof taking it, both useful.",
        "One is the monistic way, the mystical way of pure cosmic emotion.\nThe glories and grandeurs, they are yours absolutely, even in the\nmidst of your defacements. Whatever may happen to you, whatever you\nmay appear to be, inwardly you are safe. Look back, LIE back, on\nyour true principle of being! This is the famous way of quietism, of\nindifferentism. Its enemies compare it to a spiritual opium. Yet\npragmatism must respect this way, for it has massive historic\nvindication.",
        "But pragmatism sees another way to be respected also, the\npluralistic way of interpreting the poem. The you so glorified, to\nwhich the hymn is sung, may mean your better possibilities\nphenomenally taken, or the specific redemptive effects even of your\nfailures, upon yourself or others. It may mean your loyalty to the\npossibilities of others whom you admire and love so, that you are\nwilling to accept your own poor life, for it is that glory’s\npartner. You can at least appreciate, applaud, furnish the audience,\nof so brave a total world. Forget the low in yourself, then, think\nonly of the high. Identify your life therewith; then, through\nangers, losses, ignorance, ennui, whatever you thus make yourself,\nwhatever you thus most deeply are, picks its way.",
        "In either way of taking the poem, it encourages fidelity to\nourselves. Both ways satisfy; both sanctify the human flux. Both\npaint the portrait of the YOU on a gold-background. But the\nbackground of the first way is the static One, while in the second\nway it means possibles in the plural, genuine possibles, and it has\nall the restlessness of that conception.",
        "Noble enough is either way of reading the poem; but plainly the\npluralistic way agrees with the pragmatic temper best, for it\nimmediately suggests an infinitely larger number of the details of\nfuture experience to our mind. It sets definite activities in us at\nwork. Altho this second way seems prosaic and earthborn in\ncomparison with the first way, yet no one can accuse it of tough-\nmindedness in any brutal sense of the term. Yet if, as pragmatists,\nyou should positively set up the second way AGAINST the first way,\nyou would very likely be misunderstood. You would be accused of\ndenying nobler conceptions, and of being an ally of tough-mindedness\nin the worst sense.",
        "You remember the letter from a member of this audience from which I\nread some extracts at our previous meeting. Let me read you an\nadditional extract now. It shows a vagueness in realizing the\nalternatives before us which I think is very widespread.",
        "“I believe,” writes my friend and correspondent, “in pluralism; I\nbelieve that in our search for truth we leap from one floating cake\nof ice to another, on an infinite sea, and that by each of our acts\nwe make new truths possible and old ones impossible; I believe that\neach man is responsible for making the universe better, and that if\nhe does not do this it will be in so far left undone.",
        "“Yet at the same time I am willing to endure that my children should\nbe incurably sick and suffering (as they are not) and I myself\nstupid and yet with brains enough to see my stupidity, only on one\ncondition, namely, that through the construction, in imagination and\nby reasoning, of a RATIONAL UNITY OF ALL THINGS, I can conceive my\nacts and my thoughts and my troubles as SUPPLEMENTED: BY ALL THE\nOTHER PHENOMENA OF THE WORLD, AND AS FORMING–WHEN THUS\nSUPPLEMENTED–A SCHEME WHICH I APPROVE AND ADOPT AS MY I OWN; and\nfor my part I refuse to be persuaded that we cannot look beyond the\nobvious pluralism of the naturalist and pragmatist to a logical\nunity in which they take no interest or stock.”",
        "Such a fine expression of personal faith warms the heart of the\nhearer. But how much does it clear his philosophic head? Does the\nwriter consistently favor the monistic, or the pluralistic,\ninterpretation of the world’s poem? His troubles become atoned for\nWHEN THUS SUPPLEMENTED, he says, supplemented, that is, by all the\nremedies that THE OTHER PHENOMENA may supply. Obviously here the\nwriter faces forward into the particulars of experience, which he\ninterprets in a pluralistic-melioristic way.",
        "But he believes himself to face backward. He speaks of what he calls\nthe rational UNITY of things, when all the while he really means\ntheir possible empirical UNIFICATION. He supposes at the same time\nthat the pragmatist, because he criticizes rationalism’s abstract\nOne, is cut off from the consolation of believing in the saving\npossibilities of the concrete many. He fails in short to distinguish\nbetween taking the world’s perfection as a necessary principle, and\ntaking it only as a possible terminus ad quem.",
        "I regard the writer of this letter as a genuine pragmatist, but as a\npragmatist sans le savoir. He appears to me as one of that numerous\nclass of philosophic amateurs whom I spoke of in my first lecture,\nas wishing to have all the good things going, without being too\ncareful as to how they agree or disagree. “Rational unity of all\nthings” is so inspiring a formula, that he brandishes it offhand,\nand abstractly accuses pluralism of conflicting with it (for the\nbare names do conflict), altho concretely he means by it just the\npragmatistically unified and ameliorated world. Most of us remain in\nthis essential vagueness, and it is well that we should; but in the\ninterest of clear-headedness it is well that some of us should go\nfarther, so I will try now to focus a little more discriminatingly\non this particular religious point.",
        "Is then this you of yous, this absolutely real world, this unity\nthat yields the moral inspiration and has the religious value, to be\ntaken monistically or pluralistically? Is it ante rem or in rebus?\nIs it a principle or an end, an absolute or an ultimate, a first or\na last? Does it make you look forward or lie back? It is certainly\nworth while not to clump the two things together, for if\ndiscriminated, they have decidedly diverse meanings for life.",
        "Please observe that the whole dilemma revolves pragmatically about\nthe notion of the world’s possibilities. Intellectually, rationalism\ninvokes its absolute principle of unity as a ground of possibility\nfor the many facts. Emotionally, it sees it as a container and\nlimiter of possibilities, a guarantee that the upshot shall be good.\nTaken in this way, the absolute makes all good things certain, and\nall bad things impossible (in the eternal, namely), and may be said\nto transmute the entire category of possibility into categories more\nsecure. One sees at this point that the great religious difference\nlies between the men who insist that the world MUST AND SHALL BE,\nand those who are contented with believing that the world MAY BE,\nsaved. The whole clash of rationalistic and empiricist religion is\nthus over the validity of possibility. It is necessary therefore to\nbegin by focusing upon that word. What may the word ’possible’\ndefinitely mean?",
        "To unreflecting men the possible means a sort of third estate of\nbeing, less real than existence, more real than non-existence, a\ntwilight realm, a hybrid status, a limbo into which and out of which\nrealities ever and anon are made to pass. Such a conception is of\ncourse too vague and nondescript to satisfy us. Here, as elsewhere,\nthe only way to extract a term’s meaning is to use the pragmatic\nmethod on it. When you say that a thing is possible, what difference\ndoes it make?",
        "It makes at least this difference that if anyone calls it impossible\nyou can contradict him, if anyone calls it actual you can contradict\nHIM, and if anyone calls it necessary you can contradict him too.\nBut these privileges of contradiction don’t amount to much. When you\nsay a thing is possible, does not that make some farther difference\nin terms of actual fact?",
        "It makes at least this negative difference that if the statement be\ntrue, it follows that there is nothing extant capable of preventing\nthe possible thing. The absence of real grounds of interference may\nthus be said to make things not impossible, possible therefore in\nthe bare or abstract sense.",
        "But most possibles are not bare, they are concretely grounded, or\nwell-grounded, as we say. What does this mean pragmatically? It\nmeans, not only that there are no preventive conditions present, but\nthat some of the conditions of production of the possible thing\nactually are here. Thus a concretely possible chicken means: (1)\nthat the idea of chicken contains no essential self-contradiction;\n(2) that no boys, skunks, or other enemies are about; and (3) that\nat least an actual egg exists. Possible chicken means actual egg–\nplus actual sitting hen, or incubator, or what not. As the actual\nconditions approach completeness the chicken becomes a better-and-\nbetter-grounded possibility. When the conditions are entirely\ncomplete, it ceases to be a possibility, and turns into an actual\nfact.",
        "Let us apply this notion to the salvation of the world. What does it\npragmatically mean to say that this is possible? It means that some\nof the conditions of the world’s deliverance do actually exist. The\nmore of them there are existent, the fewer preventing conditions you\ncan find, the better-grounded is the salvation’s possibility, the\nmore PROBABLE does the fact of the deliverance become.",
        "So much for our preliminary look at possibility.",
        "Now it would contradict the very spirit of life to say that our\nminds must be indifferent and neutral in questions like that of the\nworld’s salvation. Anyone who pretends to be neutral writes himself\ndown here as a fool and a sham. We all do wish to minimize the\ninsecurity of the universe; we are and ought to be unhappy when we\nregard it as exposed to every enemy and open to every life-\ndestroying draft. Nevertheless there are unhappy men who think the\nsalvation of the world impossible. Theirs is the doctrine known as\npessimism.",
        "Optimism in turn would be the doctrine that thinks the world’s\nsalvation inevitable.",
        "Midway between the two there stands what may be called the doctrine\nof meliorism, tho it has hitherto figured less as a doctrine than as\nan attitude in human affairs. Optimism has always been the regnant\nDOCTRINE in european philosophy. Pessimism was only recently\nintroduced by Schopenhauer and counts few systematic defenders as\nyet. Meliorism treats salvation as neither inevitable nor\nimpossible. It treats it as a possibility, which becomes more and\nmore of a probability the more numerous the actual conditions of\nsalvation become.",
        "It is clear that pragmatism must incline towards meliorism. Some\nconditions of the world’s salvation are actually extant, and she\ncannot possibly close her eyes to this fact: and should the residual\nconditions come, salvation would become an accomplished reality.\nNaturally the terms I use here are exceedingly summary. You may\ninterpret the word ’salvation’ in any way you like, and make it as\ndiffuse and distributive, or as climacteric and integral a\nphenomenon as you please.",
        "Take, for example, any one of us in this room with the ideals which\nhe cherishes, and is willing to live and work for. Every such ideal\nrealized will be one moment in the world’s salvation. But these\nparticular ideals are not bare abstract possibilities. They are\ngrounded, they are LIVE possibilities, for we are their live\nchampions and pledges, and if the complementary conditions come and\nadd themselves, our ideals will become actual things. What now are\nthe complementary conditions? They are first such a mixture of\nthings as will in the fulness of time give us a chance, a gap that\nwe can spring into, and, finally, OUR ACT.",
        "Does our act then CREATE the world’s salvation so far as it makes\nroom for itself, so far as it leaps into the gap? Does it create,\nnot the whole world’s salvation of course, but just so much of this\nas itself covers of the world’s extent?",
        "Here I take the bull by the horns, and in spite of the whole crew of\nrationalists and monists, of whatever brand they be, I ask WHY NOT?\nOur acts, our turning-places, where we seem to ourselves to make\nourselves and grow, are the parts of the world to which we are\nclosest, the parts of which our knowledge is the most intimate and\ncomplete. Why should we not take them at their face-value? Why may\nthey not be the actual turning-places and growing-places which they\nseem to be, of the world–why not the workshop of being, where we\ncatch fact in the making, so that nowhere may the world grow in any\nother kind of way than this?",
        "Irrational! we are told. How can new being come in local spots and\npatches which add themselves or stay away at random, independently\nof the rest? There must be a reason for our acts, and where in the\nlast resort can any reason be looked for save in the material\npressure or the logical compulsion of the total nature of the world?\nThere can be but one real agent of growth, or seeming growth,\nanywhere, and that agent is the integral world itself. It may grow\nall-over, if growth there be, but that single parts should grow per\nse is irrational.",
        "But if one talks of rationality and of reasons for things, and\ninsists that they can’t just come in spots, what KIND of a reason\ncan there ultimately be why anything should come at all? Talk of\nlogic and necessity and categories and the absolute and the contents\nof the whole philosophical machine-shop as you will, the only REAL\nreason I can think of why anything should ever come is that someone\nwishes it to be here. It is DEMANDED, demanded, it may be, to give\nrelief to no matter how small a fraction of the world’s mass. This\nis living reason, and compared with it material causes and logical\nnecessities are spectral things.",
        "In short the only fully rational world would be the world of\nwishing-caps, the world of telepathy, where every desire is\nfulfilled instanter, without having to consider or placate\nsurrounding or intermediate powers. This is the Absolute’s own\nworld. He calls upon the phenomenal world to be, and it IS, exactly\nas he calls for it, no other condition being required. In our world,\nthe wishes of the individual are only one condition. Other\nindividuals are there with other wishes and they must be propitiated\nfirst. So Being grows under all sorts of resistances in this world\nof the many, and, from compromise to compromise, only gets organized\ngradually into what may be called secondarily rational shape. We\napproach the wishing-cap type of organization only in a few\ndepartments of life. We want water and we turn a faucet. We want a\nkodak-picture and we press a button. We want information and we\ntelephone. We want to travel and we buy a ticket. In these and\nsimilar cases, we hardly need to do more than the wishing–the world\nis rationally organized to do the rest.",
        "But this talk of rationality is a parenthesis and a digression. What\nwe were discussing was the idea of a world growing not integrally\nbut piecemeal by the contributions of its several parts. Take the\nhypothesis seriously and as a live one. Suppose that the world’s\nauthor put the case to you before creation, saying: “I am going to\nmake a world not certain to be saved, a world the perfection of\nwhich shall be conditional merely, the condition being that each\nseveral agent does its own ’level best.’ I offer you the chance of\ntaking part in such a world. Its safety, you see, is unwarranted. It\nis a real adventure, with real danger, yet it may win through. It is\na social scheme of co-operative work genuinely to be done. Will you\njoin the procession? Will you trust yourself and trust the other\nagents enough to face the risk?”",
        "Should you in all seriousness, if participation in such a world were\nproposed to you, feel bound to reject it as not safe enough? Would\nyou say that, rather than be part and parcel of so fundamentally\npluralistic and irrational a universe, you preferred to relapse into\nthe slumber of nonentity from which you had been momentarily aroused\nby the tempter’s voice?",
        "Of course if you are normally constituted, you would do nothing of\nthe sort. There is a healthy-minded buoyancy in most of us which\nsuch a universe would exactly fit. We would therefore accept the\noffer–\"Top! und schlag auf schlag!” It would be just like the world\nwe practically live in; and loyalty to our old nurse Nature would\nforbid us to say no. The world proposed would seem ’rational’ to us\nin the most living way.",
        "Most of us, I say, would therefore welcome the proposition and add\nour fiat to the fiat of the creator. Yet perhaps some would not; for\nthere are morbid minds in every human collection, and to them the\nprospect of a universe with only a fighting chance of safety would\nprobably make no appeal. There are moments of discouragement in us\nall, when we are sick of self and tired of vainly striving. Our own\nlife breaks down, and we fall into the attitude of the prodigal son.\nWe mistrust the chances of things. We want a universe where we can\njust give up, fall on our father’s neck, and be absorbed into the\nabsolute life as a drop of water melts into the river or the sea.",
        "The peace and rest, the security desiderated at such moments is\nsecurity against the bewildering accidents of so much finite\nexperience. Nirvana means safety from this everlasting round of\nadventures of which the world of sense consists. The hindoo and the\nbuddhist, for this is essentially their attitude, are simply afraid,\nafraid of more experience, afraid of life.",
        "And to men of this complexion, religious monism comes with its\nconsoling words: “All is needed and essential–even you with your\nsick soul and heart. All are one with God, and with God all is well.\nThe everlasting arms are beneath, whether in the world of finite\nappearances you seem to fail or to succeed.” There can be no doubt\nthat when men are reduced to their last sick extremity absolutism is\nthe only saving scheme. Pluralistic moralism simply makes their\nteeth chatter, it refrigerates the very heart within their breast.",
        "So we see concretely two types of religion in sharp contrast. Using\nour old terms of comparison, we may say that the absolutistic scheme\nappeals to the tender-minded while the pluralistic scheme appeals to\nthe tough. Many persons would refuse to call the pluralistic scheme\nreligious at all. They would call it moralistic, and would apply the\nword religious to the monistic scheme alone. Religion in the sense\nof self-surrender, and moralism in the sense of self-sufficingness,\nhave been pitted against each other as incompatibles frequently\nenough in the history of human thought.",
        "We stand here before the final question of philosophy. I said in my\nfourth lecture that I believed the monistic-pluralistic alternative\nto be the deepest and most pregnant question that our minds can\nframe. Can it be that the disjunction is a final one? that only one\nside can be true? Are a pluralism and monism genuine incompatibles?\nSo that, if the world were really pluralistically constituted, if it\nreally existed distributively and were made up of a lot of eaches,\nit could only be saved piecemeal and de facto as the result of their\nbehavior, and its epic history in no wise short-circuited by some\nessential oneness in which the severalness were already ’taken up’\nbeforehand and eternally ’overcome’? If this were so, we should have\nto choose one philosophy or the other. We could not say ’yes, yes’\nto both alternatives. There would have to be a ’no’ in our relations\nwith the possible. We should confess an ultimate disappointment: we\ncould not remain healthy-minded and sick-minded in one indivisible\nact.",
        "Of course as human beings we can be healthy minds on one day and\nsick souls on the next; and as amateur dabblers in philosophy we may\nperhaps be allowed to call ourselves monistic pluralists, or free-\nwill determinists, or whatever else may occur to us of a reconciling\nkind. But as philosophers aiming at clearness and consistency, and\nfeeling the pragmatistic need of squaring truth with truth, the\nquestion is forced upon us of frankly adopting either the tender or\nthe robustious type of thought. In particular THIS query has always\ncome home to me: May not the claims of tender-mindedness go too far?\nMay not the notion of a world already saved in toto anyhow, be too\nsaccharine to stand? May not religious optimism be too idyllic? Must\nALL be saved? Is NO price to be paid in the work of salvation? Is\nthe last word sweet? Is all ’yes, yes’ in the universe? Doesn’t the\nfact of ’no’ stand at the very core of life? Doesn’t the very\n’seriousness’ that we attribute to life mean that ineluctable noes\nand losses form a part of it, that there are genuine sacrifices\nsomewhere, and that something permanently drastic and bitter always\nremains at the bottom of its cup?",
        "I can not speak officially as a pragmatist here; all I can say is\nthat my own pragmatism offers no objection to my taking sides with\nthis more moralistic view, and giving up the claim of total\nreconciliation. The possibility of this is involved in the\npragmatistic willingness to treat pluralism as a serious hypothesis.\nIn the end it is our faith and not our logic that decides such\nquestions, and I deny the right of any pretended logic to veto my\nown faith. I find myself willing to take the universe to be really\ndangerous and adventurous, without therefore backing out and crying\n’no play.’ I am willing to think that the prodigal-son attitude,\nopen to us as it is in many vicissitudes, is not the right and final\nattitude towards the whole of life. I am willing that there should\nbe real losses and real losers, and no total preservation of all\nthat is. I can believe in the ideal as an ultimate, not as an\norigin, and as an extract, not the whole. When the cup is poured\noff, the dregs are left behind forever, but the possibility of what\nis poured off is sweet enough to accept.",
        "As a matter of fact countless human imaginations live in this\nmoralistic and epic kind of a universe, and find its disseminated\nand strung-along successes sufficient for their rational needs.\nThere is a finely translated epigram in the greek anthology which\nadmirably expresses this state of mind, this acceptance of loss as\nunatoned for, even tho the lost element might be one’s self:",
        "“A shipwrecked sailor, buried on this coast, Bids you set sail.\nFull many a gallant bark, when we were lost, Weathered the gale.”",
        "Those puritans who answered ’yes’ to the question: Are you willing\nto be damned for God’s glory? were in this objective and magnanimous\ncondition of mind. The way of escape from evil on this system is NOT\nby getting it ’aufgehoben,’ or preserved in the whole as an element\nessential but ’overcome.’ It is by dropping it out altogether,\nthrowing it overboard and getting beyond it, helping to make a\nuniverse that shall forget its very place and name.",
        "It is then perfectly possible to accept sincerely a drastic kind of\na universe from which the element of ’seriousness’ is not to be\nexpelled. Whoso does so is, it seems to me, a genuine pragmatist. He\nis willing to live on a scheme of uncertified possibilities which he\ntrusts; willing to pay with his own person, if need be, for the\nrealization of the ideals which he frames.",
        "What now actually ARE the other forces which he trusts to co-operate\nwith him, in a universe of such a type? They are at least his fellow\nmen, in the stage of being which our actual universe has reached.\nBut are there not superhuman forces also, such as religious men of\nthe pluralistic type we have been considering have always believed\nin? Their words may have sounded monistic when they said “there is\nno God but God\"; but the original polytheism of mankind has only\nimperfectly and vaguely sublimated itself into monotheism, and\nmonotheism itself, so far as it was religious and not a scheme of\nclass-room instruction for the metaphysicians, has always viewed God\nas but one helper, primus inter pares, in the midst of all the\nshapers of the great world’s fate.",
        "I fear that my previous lectures, confined as they have been to\nhuman and humanistic aspects, may have left the impression on many\nof you that pragmatism means methodically to leave the superhuman\nout. I have shown small respect indeed for the Absolute, and I have\nuntil this moment spoken of no other superhuman hypothesis but that.\nBut I trust that you see sufficiently that the Absolute has nothing\nbut its superhumanness in common with the theistic God. On\npragmatistic principles, if the hypothesis of God works\nsatisfactorily in the widest sense of the word, it is true. Now\nwhatever its residual difficulties may be, experience shows that it\ncertainly does work, and that the problem is to build it out and\ndetermine it, so that it will combine satisfactorily with all the\nother working truths. I cannot start upon a whole theology at the\nend of this last lecture; but when I tell you that I have written a\nbook on men’s religious experience, which on the whole has been\nregarded as making for the reality of God, you will perhaps exempt\nmy own pragmatism from the charge of being an atheistic system. I\nfirmly disbelieve, myself, that our human experience is the highest\nform of experience extant in the universe. I believe rather that we\nstand in much the same relation to the whole of the universe as our\ncanine and feline pets do to the whole of human life. They inhabit\nour drawing-rooms and libraries. They take part in scenes of whose\nsignificance they have no inkling. They are merely tangent to curves\nof history the beginnings and ends and forms of which pass wholly\nbeyond their ken. So we are tangents to the wider life of things.\nBut, just as many of the dog’s and cat’s ideals coincide with our\nideals, and the dogs and cats have daily living proof of the fact,\nso we may well believe, on the proofs that religious experience\naffords, that higher powers exist and are at work to save the world\non ideal lines similar to our own.",
        "You see that pragmatism can be called religious, if you allow that\nreligion can be pluralistic or merely melioristic in type. But\nwhether you will finally put up with that type of religion or not is\na question that only you yourself can decide. Pragmatism has to\npostpone dogmatic answer, for we do not yet know certainly which\ntype of religion is going to work best in the long run. The various\noverbeliefs of men, their several faith-ventures, are in fact what\nare needed to bring the evidence in. You will probably make your own\nventures severally. If radically tough, the hurly-burly of the\nsensible facts of nature will be enough for you, and you will need\nno religion at all. If radically tender, you will take up with the\nmore monistic form of religion: the pluralistic form, with its\nreliance on possibilities that are not necessities, will not seem to\nafford you security enough.",
        "But if you are neither tough nor tender in an extreme and radical\nsense, but mixed as most of us are, it may seem to you that the type\nof pluralistic and moralistic religion that I have offered is as\ngood a religious synthesis as you are likely to find.
