        "It falls to the lot of few men in these days to blaze a new trail\nin Bookland.  This Mr. Brett Page has done, with firmness and\nprecision, and with a joy in every stroke that will beget in\ncountless readers that answering joy which is the reward of both\nhim who guides and him who follows.  There is but one word for a\nwork so penetrating, so eductive, so clear–and that word is\nmasterly.  Let no one believe the modest assertion that “Writing\nfor Vaudeville” is “less an original offering than a compilation.\"\nI have seen it grow and re-grow, section by section, and never\nhave I known an author give more care to the development of his\ntheme in an original way.  Mr. Page has worked with fidelity to\nthe convictions gained while himself writing professionally, yet\nwith deference for the opinions of past masters in this field.\nThe result is a book quite unexcelled among manuals of instruction,\nfor authority, full statement, analysis of the sort that leads the\nreader to see what essentials he must build into his own structures,\nand sympathetic helpfulness throughout.  I count it an honor to\nhave been the editorial sponsor for a pioneer book which will be\nsoon known everywhere.",
