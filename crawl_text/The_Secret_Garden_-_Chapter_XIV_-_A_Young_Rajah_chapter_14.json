        "The moor was hidden in mist when the morning came,\nand the rain had not stopped pouring down.  There could\nbe no going out of doors.  Martha was so busy that Mary\nhad no opportunity of talking to her, but in the afternoon\nshe asked her to come and sit with her in the nursery.\nShe came bringing the stocking she was always knitting\nwhen she was doing nothing else.",
        "“What’s the matter with thee?” she asked as soon as they\nsat down.  “Tha’ looks as if tha’d somethin’ to say.”",
        "“I have.  I have found out what the crying was,\"\nsaid Mary.",
        "Martha let her knitting drop on her knee and gazed\nat her with startled eyes.",
        "“Tha’ hasn’t!” she exclaimed.  “Never!”",
        "“I heard it in the night,” Mary went on.  “And I got\nup and went to see where it came from.  It was Colin.\nI found him.”",
        "Martha’s face became red with fright.",
        "“Eh! Miss Mary!” she said half crying.  “Tha’ shouldn’t\nhave done it–tha’ shouldn’t! Tha’ll get me in trouble.\nI never told thee nothin’ about him–but tha’ll get me\nin trouble.  I shall lose my place and what’ll mother do!”",
        "“You won’t lose your place,” said Mary.  “He was glad I came.\nWe talked and talked and he said he was glad I came.”",
        "“Was he?” cried Martha.  “Art tha’ sure? Tha’\ndoesn’t know what he’s like when anything vexes him.\nHe’s a big lad to cry like a baby, but when he’s\nin a passion he’ll fair scream just to frighten us.\nHe knows us daren’t call our souls our own.”",
        "“He wasn’t vexed,” said Mary.  “I asked him if I should go\naway and he made me stay.  He asked me questions and I\nsat on a big footstool and talked to him about India\nand about the robin and gardens.  He wouldn’t let me go.\nHe let me see his mother’s picture.  Before I left him I\nsang him to sleep.”",
        "Martha fairly gasped with amazement.",
        "“I can scarcely believe thee!” she protested.\n“It’s as if tha’d walked straight into a lion’s den.\nIf he’d been like he is most times he’d have throwed himself\ninto one of his tantrums and roused th’ house.  He won’t\nlet strangers look at him.”",
        "“He let me look at him.  I looked at him all the time\nand he looked at me.  We stared!” said Mary.",
        "“I don’t know what to do!” cried agitated Martha.\n“If Mrs. Medlock finds out, she’ll think I broke orders\nand told thee and I shall be packed back to mother.”",
        "“He is not going to tell Mrs. Medlock anything about it yet.\nIt’s to be a sort of secret just at first,” said Mary firmly.\n“And he says everybody is obliged to do as he pleases.”",
        "“Aye, that’s true enough–th’ bad lad!” sighed Martha,\nwiping her forehead with her apron.",
        "“He says Mrs. Medlock must.  And he wants me to come and talk\nto him every day.  And you are to tell me when he wants me.”",
        "“Me!” said Martha; “I shall lose my place–I shall for sure!”",
        "“You can’t if you are doing what he wants you to do\nand everybody is ordered to obey him,” Mary argued.",
        "“Does tha’ mean to say,” cried Martha with wide open eyes,\n“that he was nice to thee!”",
        "“I think he almost liked me,” Mary answered.",
        "“Then tha’ must have bewitched him!” decided Martha,\ndrawing a long breath.",
        "“Do you mean Magic?” inquired Mary.  “I’ve heard about Magic\nin India, but I can’t make it.  I just went into his room\nand I was so surprised to see him I stood and stared.\nAnd then he turned round and stared at me.  And he thought\nI was a ghost or a dream and I thought perhaps he was.\nAnd it was so queer being there alone together in the\nmiddle of the night and not knowing about each other.\nAnd we began to ask each other questions.  And when I asked\nhim if I must go away he said I must not.”",
        "“Th’ world’s comin’ to a end!” gasped Martha.",
        "“What is the matter with him?” asked Mary.",
        "“Nobody knows for sure and certain,” said Martha.\n“Mr. Craven went off his head like when he was born.\nTh’ doctors thought he’d have to be put in a ’sylum.\nIt was because Mrs. Craven died like I told you.\nHe wouldn’t set eyes on th’ baby.  He just raved and said\nit’d be another hunchback like him and it’d better die.”",
        "“Is Colin a hunchback?” Mary asked.  “He didn’t look\nlike one.”",
        "“He isn’t yet,” said Martha.  “But he began all wrong.\nMother said that there was enough trouble and raging in th’\nhouse to set any child wrong.  They was afraid his back\nwas weak an’ they’ve always been takin’ care of it–keepin’\nhim lyin’ down and not lettin’ him walk.  Once they made\nhim wear a brace but he fretted so he was downright ill.\nThen a big doctor came to see him an’ made them take it off.\nHe talked to th’ other doctor quite rough–in a polite way.\nHe said there’d been too much medicine and too much lettin’\nhim have his own way.”",
        "“I think he’s a very spoiled boy,” said Mary.",
        "“He’s th’ worst young nowt as ever was!” said Martha.\n“I won’t say as he hasn’t been ill a good bit.\nHe’s had coughs an’ colds that’s nearly killed him two\nor three times.  Once he had rheumatic fever an’ once he\nhad typhoid.  Eh! Mrs. Medlock did get a fright then.\nHe’d been out of his head an’ she was talkin’ to th’\nnurse, thinkin’ he didn’t know nothin’, an’ she said,\n`He’ll die this time sure enough, an’ best thing for him an’\nfor everybody.’ An’ she looked at him an’ there he\nwas with his big eyes open, starin’ at her as sensible\nas she was herself.  She didn’t know wha’d happen but he\njust stared at her an’ says, `You give me some water an’\nstop talkin’.’”",
        "“Do you think he will die?” asked Mary.",
        "“Mother says there’s no reason why any child should live\nthat gets no fresh air an’ doesn’t do nothin’ but lie\non his back an’ read picture-books an’ take medicine.\nHe’s weak and hates th’ trouble o’ bein’ taken out o’\ndoors, an’ he gets cold so easy he says it makes him ill.”",
        "Mary sat and looked at the fire.  “I wonder,” she said slowly,\n“if it would not do him good to go out into a garden\nand watch things growing.  It did me good.”",
        "“One of th’ worst fits he ever had,” said Martha, “was one\ntime they took him out where the roses is by the fountain.\nHe’d been readin’ in a paper about people gettin’\nsomethin’ he called `rose cold’ an’ he began to sneeze an’\nsaid he’d got it an’ then a new gardener as didn’t\nknow th’ rules passed by an’ looked at him curious.\nHe threw himself into a passion an’ he said he’d\nlooked at him because he was going to be a hunchback.\nHe cried himself into a fever an’ was ill all night.”",
        "“If he ever gets angry at me, I’ll never go and see\nhim again,” said Mary.",
        "“He’ll have thee if he wants thee,” said Martha.\n“Tha’ may as well know that at th’ start.”",
        "Very soon afterward a bell rang and she rolled up\nher knitting.",
        "“I dare say th’ nurse wants me to stay with him a bit,\"\nshe said.  “I hope he’s in a good temper.”",
        "She was out of the room about ten minutes and then she\ncame back with a puzzled expression.",
        "“Well, tha’ has bewitched him,” she said.  “He’s up on his\nsofa with his picture-books. He’s told the nurse to stay\naway until six o’clock. I’m to wait in the next room.\nTh’ minute she was gone he called me to him an’ says, `I want\nMary Lennox to come and talk to me, and remember you’re\nnot to tell any one.’ You’d better go as quick as you can.”",
        "Mary was quite willing to go quickly.  She did not want\nto see Colin as much as she wanted to see Dickon;\nbut she wanted to see him very much.",
        "There was a bright fire on the hearth when she entered\nhis room, and in the daylight she saw it was a very\nbeautiful room indeed.  There were rich colors in the\nrugs and hangings and pictures and books on the walls\nwhich made it look glowing and comfortable even in spite\nof the gray sky and falling rain.  Colin looked rather\nlike a picture himself.  He was wrapped in a velvet\ndressing-gown and sat against a big brocaded cushion.\nHe had a red spot on each cheek.",
        "“Come in,” he said.  “I’ve been thinking about you\nall morning.”",
        "“I’ve been thinking about you, too,” answered Mary.\n“You don’t know how frightened Martha is.  She says\nMrs. Medlock will think she told me about you and then she\nwill be sent away.”",
        "He frowned.",
        "“Go and tell her to come here,” he said.  “She is\nin the next room.”",
        "Mary went and brought her back.  Poor Martha was shaking\nin her shoes.  Colin was still frowning.",
        "“Have you to do what I please or have you not?” he demanded.",
        "“I have to do what you please, sir,” Martha faltered,\nturning quite red.",
        "“Has Medlock to do what I please?”",
        "“Everybody has, sir,” said Martha.",
        "“Well, then, if I order you to bring Miss Mary to me,\nhow can Medlock send you away if she finds it out?”",
        "“Please don’t let her, sir,” pleaded Martha.",
        "“I’ll send her away if she dares to say a word about such\na thing,” said Master Craven grandly.  “She wouldn’t\nlike that, I can tell you.”",
        "“Thank you, sir,” bobbing a curtsy, “I want to do my duty, sir.”",
        "“What I want is your duty” said Colin more grandly still.\n“I’ll take care of you.  Now go away.”",
        "When the door closed behind Martha, Colin found Mistress\nMary gazing at him as if he had set her wondering.",
        "“Why do you look at me like that?” he asked her.\n“What are you thinking about?”",
        "“I am thinking about two things.”",
        "“What are they? Sit down and tell me.”",
        "“This is the first one,” said Mary, seating herself on the\nbig stool.  “Once in India I saw a boy who was a Rajah.\nHe had rubies and emeralds and diamonds stuck all over him.\nHe spoke to his people just as you spoke to Martha.\nEverybody had to do everything he told them–in a minute.\nI think they would have been killed if they hadn’t.”",
        "“I shall make you tell me about Rajahs presently,” he said,\n“but first tell me what the second thing was.”",
        "“I was thinking,” said Mary, “how different you are\nfrom Dickon.”",
        "“Who is Dickon?” he said.  “What a queer name!”",
        "She might as well tell him, she thought she could talk\nabout Dickon without mentioning the secret garden.  She had\nliked to hear Martha talk about him.  Besides, she longed\nto talk about him.  It would seem to bring him nearer.",
        "“He is Martha’s brother.  He is twelve years old,\"\nshe explained.  “He is not like any one else in the world.\nHe can charm foxes and squirrels and birds just as the\nnatives in India charm snakes.  He plays a very soft tune\non a pipe and they come and listen.”",
        "There were some big books on a table at his side and he\ndragged one suddenly toward him.  “There is a picture\nof a snake-charmer in this,” he exclaimed.  “Come and look\nat it”",
        "The book was a beautiful one with superb colored\nillustrations and he turned to one of them.",
        "“Can he do that?” he asked eagerly.",
        "“He played on his pipe and they listened,” Mary explained.\n“But he doesn’t call it Magic.  He says it’s because he\nlives on the moor so much and he knows their ways.  He says\nhe feels sometimes as if he was a bird or a rabbit himself,\nhe likes them so.  I think he asked the robin questions.\nIt seemed as if they talked to each other in soft chirps.”",
        "Colin lay back on his cushion and his eyes grew larger\nand larger and the spots on his cheeks burned.",
        "“Tell me some more about him,” he said.",
        "“He knows all about eggs and nests,” Mary went on.\n“And he knows where foxes and badgers and otters live.\nHe keeps them secret so that other boys won’t find their holes\nand frighten them.  He knows about everything that grows\nor lives on the moor.”",
        "“Does he like the moor?” said Colin.  “How can he\nwhen it’s such a great, bare, dreary place?”",
        "“It’s the most beautiful place,” protested Mary.\n“Thousands of lovely things grow on it and there are\nthousands of little creatures all busy building nests\nand making holes and burrows and chippering or singing\nor squeaking to each other.  They are so busy and having\nsuch fun under the earth or in the trees or heather.\nIt’s their world.”",
        "“How do you know all that?” said Colin, turning on his\nelbow to look at her.",
        "“I have never been there once, really,” said Mary\nsuddenly remembering.  “I only drove over it in the dark.\nI thought it was hideous.  Martha told me about it first\nand then Dickon.  When Dickon talks about it you feel\nas if you saw things and heard them and as if you were\nstanding in the heather with the sun shining and the gorse\nsmelling like honey–and all full of bees and butterflies.”",
        "“You never see anything if you are ill,” said\nColin restlessly.  He looked like a person listening\nto a new sound in the distance and wondering what it was.",
        "“You can’t if you stay in a room,” said Mary.",
        "“I couldn’t go on the moor,” he said in a resentful tone.",
        "Mary was silent for a minute and then she said something bold.",
        "“You might–sometime.”",
        "He moved as if he were startled.",
        "“Go on the moor! How could I? I am going to die.\"\n“How do you know?” said Mary unsympathetically.\nShe didn’t like the way he had of talking about dying.\nShe did not feel very sympathetic.  She felt rather as if he\nalmost boasted about it.",
        "“Oh, I’ve heard it ever since I remember,” he answered crossly.\n“They are always whispering about it and thinking\nI don’t notice.  They wish I would, too.”",
        "Mistress Mary felt quite contrary.  She pinched her\nlips together.",
        "“If they wished I would,” she said, “I wouldn’t. Who\nwishes you would?”",
        "“The servants–and of course Dr. Craven because he would\nget Misselthwaite and be rich instead of poor.  He daren’t\nsay so, but he always looks cheerful when I am worse.\nWhen I had typhoid fever his face got quite fat.  I think\nmy father wishes it, too.”",
        "“I don’t believe he does,” said Mary quite obstinately.",
        "That made Colin turn and look at her again.",
        "“Don’t you?” he said.",
        "And then he lay back on his cushion and was still, as if\nhe were thinking.  And there was quite a long silence.\nPerhaps they were both of them thinking strange things\nchildren do not usually think.  “I like the grand doctor\nfrom London, because he made them take the iron thing off,\"\nsaid Mary at last “Did he say you were going to die?”",
        "“No.”.",
        "“What did he say?”",
        "“He didn’t whisper,” Colin answered.  “Perhaps he knew I\nhated whispering.  I heard him say one thing quite aloud.\nHe said, ’The lad might live if he would make up his mind\nto it.  Put him in the humor.’ It sounded as if he was\nin a temper.”",
        "“I’ll tell you who would put you in the humor, perhaps,\"\nsaid Mary reflecting.  She felt as if she would like this\nthing to be settled one way or the other.  “I believe\nDickon would.  He’s always talking about live things.\nHe never talks about dead things or things that are ill.\nHe’s always looking up in the sky to watch birds flying–or\nlooking down at the earth to see something growing.\nHe has such round blue eyes and they are so wide open with\nlooking about.  And he laughs such a big laugh with his wide\nmouth–and his cheeks are as red–as red as cherries.\"\nShe pulled her stool nearer to the sofa and her expression\nquite changed at the remembrance of the wide curving mouth\nand wide open eyes.",
        "“See here,” she said.  “Don’t let us talk about dying;\nI don’t like it.  Let us talk about living.  Let us\ntalk and talk about Dickon.  And then we will look at\nyour pictures.”",
        "It was the best thing she could have said.  To talk about\nDickon meant to talk about the moor and about the cottage\nand the fourteen people who lived in it on sixteen shillings\na week–and the children who got fat on the moor grass\nlike the wild ponies.  And about Dickon’s mother–and\nthe skipping-rope–and the moor with the sun on it–and\nabout pale green points sticking up out of the black sod.\nAnd it was all so alive that Mary talked more than she had\never talked before–and Colin both talked and listened as he\nhad never done either before.  And they both began to laugh\nover nothings as children will when they are happy together.\nAnd they laughed so that in the end they were making\nas much noise as if they had been two ordinary healthy\nnatural ten-year-old creatures–instead of a hard, little,\nunloving girl and a sickly boy who believed that he was going to\ndie.",
        "They enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot the\npictures and they forgot about the time.  They had been\nlaughing quite loudly over Ben Weatherstaff and his robin,\nand Colin was actually sitting up as if he had forgotten\nabout his weak back, when he suddenly remembered something.\n“Do you know there is one thing we have never once\nthought of,” he said.  “We are cousins.”",
        "It seemed so queer that they had talked so much and never\nremembered this simple thing that they laughed more than ever,\nbecause they had got into the humor to laugh at anything.\nAnd in the midst of the fun the door opened and in walked\nDr. Craven and Mrs. Medlock.",
        "Dr. Craven started in actual alarm and Mrs. Medlock almost\nfell back because he had accidentally bumped against her.",
        "“Good Lord!” exclaimed poor Mrs. Medlock with her eyes\nalmost starting out of her head.  “Good Lord!”",
        "“What is this?” said Dr. Craven, coming forward.\n“What does it mean?”",
        "Then Mary was reminded of the boy Rajah again.\nColin answered as if neither the doctor’s alarm nor\nMrs. Medlock’s terror were of the slightest consequence.\nHe was as little disturbed or frightened as if an elderly\ncat and dog had walked into the room.",
        "“This is my cousin, Mary Lennox,” he said.  “I asked\nher to come and talk to me.  I like her.  She must come\nand talk to me whenever I send for her.”",
        "Dr. Craven turned reproachfully to Mrs. Medlock.\n“Oh, sir” she panted.  “I don’t know how it’s happened.\nThere’s not a servant on the place tha’d dare to talk–they\nall have their orders.”",
        "“Nobody told her anything,” said Colin.  “She heard\nme crying and found me herself.  I am glad she came.\nDon’t be silly, Medlock.”",
        "Mary saw that Dr. Craven did not look pleased, but it\nwas quite plain that he dare not oppose his patient.\nHe sat down by Colin and felt his pulse.",
        "“I am afraid there has been too much excitement.\nExcitement is not good for you, my boy,” he said.",
        "“I should be excited if she kept away,” answered Colin,\nhis eyes beginning to look dangerously sparkling.\n“I am better.  She makes me better.  The nurse must bring up\nher tea with mine.  We will have tea together.”",
        "Mrs. Medlock and Dr. Craven looked at each other in a\ntroubled way, but there was evidently nothing to be done.",
        "“He does look rather better, sir,” ventured Mrs. Medlock.\n“But\"–thinking the matter over–\"he looked better this\nmorning before she came into the room.”",
        "“She came into the room last night.  She stayed with me\na long time.  She sang a Hindustani song to me and it\nmade me go to sleep,” said Colin.  “I was better when I\nwakened up.  I wanted my breakfast.  I want my tea now.\nTell nurse, Medlock.”",
        "Dr. Craven did not stay very long.  He talked to the nurse\nfor a few minutes when she came into the room and said a few\nwords of warning to Colin.  He must not talk too much;\nhe must not forget that he was ill; he must not forget\nthat he was very easily tired.  Mary thought that there\nseemed to be a number of uncomfortable things he was not\nto forget.",
        "Colin looked fretful and kept his strange black-lashed\neyes fixed on Dr. Craven’s face.",
        "“I want to forget it,” he said at last.  “She makes me\nforget it.  That is why I want her.”",
        "Dr. Craven did not look happy when he left the room.\nHe gave a puzzled glance at the little girl sitting on\nthe large stool.  She had become a stiff, silent child\nagain as soon as he entered and he could not see what\nthe attraction was.  The boy actually did look brighter,\nhowever–and he sighed rather heavily as he went down\nthe corridor.",
        "“They are always wanting me to eat things when I don’t\nwant to,” said Colin, as the nurse brought in the tea\nand put it on the table by the sofa.  “Now, if you’ll\neat I will.  Those muffins look so nice and hot.\nTell me about Rajahs.”",
