        "Unto the Rhine now daily / the knights were seen to ride,\nWho there would be full gladly / to share the festive tide.\nTo all that thither journeyed / to the king to show them true,\nIn plenty them were given / steeds and rich apparel too.",
        "266",
        "And soon were seats made ready / for every noble guest,\nAs we have heard the story, / for highest and for best,\nTwo and thirty princes / at the festival.\nThen vied with one another / to deck themselves the ladies all.",
        "267",
        "Never was seen idle / the young Prince Giselher:\nThe guests and all their followers / received full kindly were\nBy him and eke by Gernot / and their men every one.\nThe noble thanes they greeted / as ever ’tis in honor done.",
        "268",
        "With gold bright gleaming saddles / unto the land they brought,\nGood store of rich apparel / and shields all richly wrought\nUnto the Rhine they carried / to that high festival.\nAnd joyous days were coming / for the wounded warriors all.",
        "269",
        "They who yet on couches / lay wounded grievously\nFor joy had soon forgotten / how bitter death would be:\nThe sick and all the ailing / no need of pity had.\nAnent the days of feasting / were they o’er the tidings glad,",
        "270",
        "How they should make them merry / there where all were so.\nDelight beyond all measure, / of joys an overflow,\nHad in sooth the people / seen on every hand:\nThen rose a mickle joyance / over all King Gunther’s land.",
        "271",
        "Full many a warrior valiant / one morn at Whitsuntide\nAll gorgeously apparelled / was thither seen to ride,\nFive thousand men or over, / where the feast should be;\nAnd vied in every quarter / knight with knight in revelry.",
        "272",
        "Thereof the host was mindful, / for he well did understand\nHow at heart right warmly / the hero of Netherland\nLoved alone his sister, / though her he ne’er had seen,\nWho praised for wondrous beauty / before all maidens else had been.",
        "273",
        "Then spake the thane so noble / of Metz Sir Ortwein:\n“Wilt thou full be honored / by every guest of thine,\nThen do them all the pleasure / the winsome maids to see,\nThat are held so high in honor / here in the land of Burgundy.",
        "274",
        "“What were a man’s chief pleasure, / his very joy of life,\nAn ’t were not a lovely maiden / or a stately wife?\nThen let the maid thy sister / before thy guests appear.\"\n–Brave thanes did there full many / at heart rejoice the rede to hear.",
        "275",
        "“Thy words I’ll gladly follow,\" / then the monarch said,\nAnd all the knights who heard him / ere thereat right glad.\nThen told was Queen Ute / and eke her daughter fair,\nThat they with maids in waiting / unto the court should soon repair.",
        "276",
        "Then in well-stored wardrobes / rich attire they sought,\nAnd forth from folding covers / their glittering dresses brought,\nArmbands and silken girdles / of which they many had.\nAnd zealous to adorn her / was then full many a winsome maid.",
        "277",
        "Full many a youthful squire / upon that day did try,\nBy decking of his person, / to win fair lady’s eye;\nFor the which great good fortune / he’d take no monarch’s crown:\nThey longed to see those maidens, / whom they before had never known.",
        "278",
        "For her especial service / the king did order then\nTo wait upon his sister / a hundred of his men,\nAs well upon his mother: / they carried sword in hand.\nThat was the court attendance / there in the Burgundian land.",
        "279",
        "Ute, queen so stately, / then came forth with her:\nAnd with the queen in waiting / ladies fair there were,\nA hundred or over, / in festal robes arrayed.\nEke went there with Kriemhild / full many a fair and winsome maid.",
        "280",
        "Forth from their own apartments / they all were seen to go:\nThere was a mickle pressing / of good knights to and fro,\nWho hoped to win the pleasure, / if such a thing might be,\nThe noble maiden Kriemhild, / delight of every eye, to see.",
        "281",
        "Now came she fair and lovely, / as the ruddy sun of morn\nFrom misty clouds emerging. / Straight he who long had borne\nHer in his heart and loved her, / from all his gloom was freed,\nAs so stately there before him / he saw the fair and lovely maid.",
        "282",
        "Her rich apparel glittered / with many a precious stone,\nAnd with a ruddy beauty / her cheeks like roses shone.\nThough you should wish to do so, / you could not say, I ween,\nThat e’er a fairer lady / in all the world before was seen.",
        "283",
        "As in a sky all starlit / the moon shines out so bright,\nAnd through the cloudlets peering / pours down her gentle light,\nE’en so was Kriemhild’s beauty / among her ladies fair:\nThe hearts of gallant heroes / were gladder when they saw her there.",
        "284",
        "The richly clad attendants / moved stately on before,\nAnd the valiant thanes high-hearted / stood patiently no more,\nBut pressed right eager forward / to see the lovely maid:\nIn noble Siegfried’s bosom / alternate joy and anguish swayed.",
        "285",
        "He thought with heart despairing, / “How could it ever be,\nThat I should win thy favor? / There hoped I foolishly.\nBut had I e’er to shun thee, / then were I rather dead.\"\nAnd oft, to think upon it, / the color from his visage fled.",
        "286",
        "The noble son of Siegmund / did there so stately stand\nAs if his form were pictured / by good old master’s hand\nUpon a piece of parchment. / All who saw, confessed\nThat he of all good heroes / was the stateliest and the best.",
        "287",
        "The fair Kriemhild’s attendants / gave order to make way\nOn all sides for the ladies, / and willing thanes obey.\nTo see their noble bearing / did every warrior cheer;\nFull many a stately lady / of gentle manner born was there.",
        "288",
        "Then outspake of Burgundy / Gernot the valiant knight:\n“To him who thus has helped thee / so bravely in the fight,\nGunther, royal brother, / shalt thou like favor show,\nA thane before all others; / he’s worthy of it well, I trow.",
        "289",
        "“Let then the doughty Siegfried / unto my sister go\nTo have the maiden’s greetings, / –’twill be our profit so.\nShe that ne’er greeted hero / shall greet him courteously,\nThat thus the stately warrior / for aye our faithful friend may be.”",
        "290",
        "The king’s knights hastened gladly / upon his high command\nAnd told these joyous tidings / to the prince of Netherland.\n“It is the king’s good pleasure / that thou to court shalt go,\nTo have his sister’s greetings; / to honor thee ’tis ordered so.”",
        "291",
        "Then was the thane full valiant / thereat soon filled with joy.\nYea, bore he in his bosom / delight without alloy\nAt thought that he should straightway / Ute’s fair daughter see.\nSiegfried anon she greeted / in courteous manner lovingly.",
        "292",
        "As she saw the knight high-hearted / there before her stand,\nBlushed red and spake the maiden, / the fairest of the land:\n“A welcome, brave Sir Siegfried, / thou noble knight and good.\"\nAs soon as he had heard it, / the hearty greeting cheered his mood.",
        "293",
        "Before her low he bended; / him by the hand took she,\nAnd by her onward wended / the knight full willingly.\nThey cast upon each other / fond glances many a one,\nThe knight and eke the maiden; / furtively it all was done.",
        "294",
        "Whether he pressed friendly / that hand as white as snow\nFrom the love he bore her, / that I do not know;\nYet believe I cannot / that this was left undone,\nFor straightway showed the maiden / that he her heart had fully won.",
        "295",
        "In the sunny summer season / and in the month of May\nHad his heart seen never / before so glad a day,\nNor one so fully joyous, / as when he walked beside\nThat maiden rich in beauty / whom fain he’d choose to be his bride.",
        "296",
        "Then thought many a warrior: / “Were it likewise granted me\nTo walk beside the maiden, / just as now I see,\nOr to lie beside her, / how gladly were that done!\"\nBut ne’er a knight more fully / had gracious lady’s favor won.",
        "297",
        "From all the lands far distant / were guests distinguished there,\nBut fixed each eye was only / upon this single pair.\nBy royal leave did Kriemhild / kiss then the stately knight:\nIn all the world he never / before had known so rare delight.",
        "298",
        "Then full of strange forebodings, / of Denmark spake the king:\n“This full loving greeting / to many woe will bring,\n–My heart in secret warns me– / through Siegfried’s doughty hand.\nGod give that he may never / again be seen within my land.”",
        "299",
        "On all sides then ’twas ordered / ’fore Kriemhild and her train\nOf women make free passage. / Full many a valiant thane\nWith her unto the minster / in courtly way went on.\nBut from her side was parted / the full stately knight anon.",
        "300",
        "Then went she to the minster, / and with her many a maid.\nIn such rich apparel / Kriemhild was arrayed,\nThat hearty wishes many / there were made in vain:\nHer comely form delighted / the eye of many a noble thane.",
        "301",
        "Scarce could tarry Siegfried / till mass was sung the while.\nAnd surely did Dame Fortune / upon him kindly smile,\nTo him she was so gracious / whom in his heart he bore.\nEke did he the maiden, / as she full well deserved, adore.",
        "302",
        "As after mass then Kriemhild / came to the minster door,\nThe knight his homage offered, / as he had done before.\nThen began to thank him / the full beauteous maid,\nThat he her royal brothers / did ’gainst their foes so nobly aid.",
        "303",
        "“God speed thee, Sir Siegfried,\" / spake the maiden fair,\n“For thou hast well deserved / that all these warriors are,\nAs it hath now been told me, / right grateful unto thee.\"\nThen gan he cast his glances / on the Lady Kriemhild lovingly.",
        "304",
        "“True will I ever serve them,\" / –so spake the noble thane–\n“And my head shall never / be laid to rest again,\nTill I, if life remaineth, / have their good favor won.\nIn sooth, my Lady Kriemhild, / for thy fair grace it all is done.”",
        "305",
        "Ne’er a day passed over / for a twelve of happy days,\nBut saw they there beside him / the maiden all did praise,\nAs she before her kinsmen / to court would daily go:\nIt pleased the thane full highly / that they did him such honor show.",
        "306",
        "Delight and great rejoicing, / a mighty jubilee,\nBefore King Gunther’s castle / daily might ye see,\nWithout and eke within it, / ’mongst keen men many a one.\nBy Ortwein and by Hagen / great deeds and wondrous there were done.",
        "307",
        "Whate’er was done by any, / in all they ready were\nTo join in way right lusty, / both the warriors rare:\nWhereby ’mongst all the strangers / they won an honored name,\nAnd through their deeds so wondrous / of Gunther’s land spread far the\n      fame.",
        "308",
        "Who erstwhile lay sore wounded / now were whole again,\nAnd fain would share the pastime, / with all the king’s good men;\nWith shields join in the combat, / and try the shaft so long.\nWherein did join them many / of the merry-making throng.",
        "309",
        "To all who joined the feasting / the host in plenty bade\nSupply the choicest viands: / so guarded well he had\n’Gainst whate’er reproaches / could rise from spite or spleen.\nUnto his guests right friendly / to go the monarch now was seen.",
        "310",
        "He spake: “Ye thanes high-hearted, / ere now ye part from me,\nAccept of these my presents; / for I would willingly\nRepay your noble service. / Despise ye not, I pray,\nWhat now I will share with you: / ’tis offered in right grateful way.”",
        "311",
        "Straightway they of Denmark / thus to the king replied:\n“Ere now upon our journey / home again we ride,\nWe long for lasting friendship. / Thereof we knights have need,\nFor many a well-loved kinsman / at hands of thy good thanes lies dead.”",
        "312",
        "Luedegast was recovered / from all his wounds so sore,\nAnd eke the lord of Saxons / from fight was whole once more.\nSome amongst their warriors / left they dead behind.\nThen went forth King Gunther / where he Siegfried might find.",
        "313",
        "Unto the thane then spake he: / “Thy counsel give, I pray.\nThe foes whom we hold captive / fain would leave straightway,\nAnd long for lasting friendship / with all my men and me.\nNow tell me, good Sir Siegfried, / what here seemeth good to thee.",
        "314",
        "“What the lords bid as ransom, / shall now to thee be told\nWhate’er five hundred horses / might bear of ruddy gold,\nThey’d give to me right gladly, / would I but let them free.\"\nThen spake the noble Siegfried: / “That were to do right foolishly.",
        "315",
        "“Thou shalt let them freely / journey hence again;\nAnd that they both hereafter / shall evermore refrain\nFrom leading hostile army / against thee and thy land,\nTherefor in pledge of friendship / let each now give to thee the hand.”",
        "316",
        "“Thy rede I’ll gladly follow.\" / Straightway forth they went.\nTo those who offered ransom / the answer then was sent,\nTheir gold no one desired / which they would give before.\nThe warriors battle-weary / dear friends did yearn to see once more.",
        "317",
        "Full many a shield all laden / with treasure forth they bore:\nHe dealt it round unmeasured / to friends in goodly store;\nEach one had marks five hundred / and some had more, I ween.\nTherein King Gunther followed / the rede of Gernot, knight full keen.",
        "318",
        "Then was a great leave-taking, / as they departed thence.\nThe warriors all ’fore Kriemhild / appeared in reverence,\nAnd eke there where her mother / Queen Ute sat near by.\nGallant thanes were never / dismissed as these so graciously.",
        "319",
        "Bare were the lodging-places, / when away the strangers rode.\nYet in right lordly manner / there at home abode\nThe king with friends around him, / full noble men who were.\nAnd them now saw they daily / at court before Kriemhild appear.",
        "320",
        "Eke would the gallant hero / Siegfried thence depart,\nThe thing to gain despairing / whereon was set his heart.\nThe king was told the tidings / how that he would away.\nGiselher his brother / did win the knight with them to stay.",
        "321",
        "“Whither, O noble Siegfried, / wilt thou now from us ride?\nDo as I earnest pray thee, / and with these thanes abide,\nAs guest here with King Gunther, / and live right merrily.\nHere dwell fair ladies many: / them will he gladly let thee see.”",
        "322",
        "Then spake the doughty Siegfried: / “Our steeds leave yet at rest,\nThe while from this my purpose / to part will I desist.\nOur shields once more take from us. / Though gladly home I would,\nNaught ’gainst the fond entreaties / of Giselher avail me could.”",
        "323",
        "So stayed the knight full gallant / for sake of friendship there.\nIn sooth in ne’er another / country anywhere\nHad he so gladly lingered: / iwis it was that he,\nNow whensoe’er he wished it, / Kriemhild the maiden fair could see.",
        "324",
        "’Twas her surpassing beauty / that made the knight to stay.\nWith many a merry pastime / they whiled the time away;\nBut love for her oppressed him, / oft-times grievously.\nWhereby anon the hero / a mournful death was doomed to die.",
