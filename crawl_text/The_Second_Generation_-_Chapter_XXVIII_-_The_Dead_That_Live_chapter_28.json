        "On the green oval within and opposite the entrance to the main campus of\nthe great university there is the colossal statue of a master workman.\nThe sculptor has done well. He does not merely show you the physical\nman–the mass, the strength, of bone and sinew and muscle; he reveals the\nman within–the big, courageous soul. Strangers often think this statue a\npersonation of the force which in a few brief generations has erected\nfrom a wilderness our vast and splendid America. And it is that; but to\nArthur and Adelaide, standing before it in a June twilight, long after\nthe events above chronicled, it is their father–Hiram.",
