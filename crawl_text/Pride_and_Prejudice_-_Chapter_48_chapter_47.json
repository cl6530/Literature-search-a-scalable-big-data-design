        "The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the\nnext morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line\nfrom him.  His family knew him to be, on all common occasions,\na most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time\nthey had hoped for exertion.  They were forced to conclude that\nhe had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of that they\nwould have been glad to be certain.  Mr. Gardiner had waited\nonly for the letters before he set off.",
        "When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving\nconstant information of what was going on, and their uncle\npromised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to\nLongbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his\nsister, who considered it as the only security for her husband’s\nnot being killed in a duel.",
        "Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire\na few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be\nserviceable to her nieces.  She shared in their attendance on\nMrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of\nfreedom.  Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and\nalways, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening\nthem up–though, as she never came without reporting some\nfresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity, she\nseldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than\nshe found them.",
        "All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three\nmonths before, had been almost an angel of light.  He was\ndeclared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his\nintrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been\nextended into every tradesman’s family.  Everybody declared\nthat he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody\nbegan to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance\nof his goodness.  Elizabeth, though she did not credit above\nhalf of what was said, believed enough to make her former\nassurance of her sister’s ruin more certain; and even Jane,\nwho believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more\nespecially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to\nScotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of,\nthey must in all probability have gained some news of them.",
        "Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife\nreceived a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival,\nhe had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to\ncome to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to\nEpsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining\nany satisfactory information; and that he was now determined\nto inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet\nthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on\ntheir first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.\nMr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this\nmeasure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist\nhim in pursuing it.  He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly\ndisinclined at present to leave London and promised to write\nagain very soon.  There was also a postscript to this effect:",
        "“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out,\nif possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the\nregiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections\nwho would be likely to know in what part of town he has now\nconcealed himself.  If there were anyone that one could apply\nto with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be\nof essential consequence.  At present we have nothing to guide\nus.  Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power\nto satisfy us on this head.  But, on second thoughts, perhaps,\nLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than\nany other person.”",
        "Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this\ndeference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her\npower to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the\ncompliment deserved.  She had never heard of his having had\nany relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had\nbeen dead many years.  It was possible, however, that some of\nhis companions in the ––shire might be able to give more\ninformation; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting\nit, the application was a something to look forward to.",
        "Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most\nanxious part of each was when the post was expected.  The\narrival of letters was the grand object of every morning’s\nimpatience.  Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to\nbe told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was\nexpected to bring some news of importance.",
        "But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived\nfor their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins;\nwhich, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for\nhim in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who\nknew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her,\nand read it likewise.  It was as follows:",
        "“My Dear Sir,",
        "“I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation\nin life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\nsuffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter\nfrom Hertfordshire.  Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins\nand myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable\nfamily, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest\nkind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.\nNo arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so\nsevere a misfortune–or that may comfort you, under a circumstance\nthat must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent’s mind.\nThe death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison\nof this.  And it is the more to be lamented, because there is\nreason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this\nlicentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from\na faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the\nconsolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think\nthat her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not\nbe guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age.  Howsoever that\nmay be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not\nonly joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and\nher daughter, to whom I have related the affair.  They agree with\nme in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be\ninjurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady\nCatherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves\nwith such a family?  And this consideration leads me moreover\nto reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event\nof last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been\ninvolved in all your sorrow and disgrace.  Let me then advise you,\ndear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off\nyour unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her\nto reap the fruits of her own heinous offense.",
        "“I am, dear sir, etc., etc.”",
        "Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer\nfrom Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant\nnature to send.  It was not known that Wickham had a single\nrelationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it\nwas certain that he had no near one living.  His former\nacquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the\nmilitia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular\nfriendship with any of them.  There was no one, therefore, who\ncould be pointed out as likely to give any news of him.  And\nin the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very\npowerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery\nby Lydia’s relations, for it had just transpired that he had\nleft gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.\nColonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds\nwould be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.  He owed\na good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more\nformidable.  Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these\nparticulars from the Longbourn family.  Jane heard them with\nhorror.  “A gamester!” she cried.  “This is wholly unexpected.\nI had not an idea of it.”",
        "Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see\ntheir father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.\nRendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he\nhad yielded to his brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return\nto his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might\nsuggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.  When Mrs.\nBennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction\nas her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his\nlife had been before.",
        "“What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried.\n“Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.  Who\nis to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?”",
        "As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled\nthat she and the children should go to London, at the same time\nthat Mr. Bennet came from it.  The coach, therefore, took them\nthe first stage of their journey, and brought its master back\nto Longbourn.",
        "Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth\nand her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part\nof the world.  His name had never been voluntarily mentioned\nbefore them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which\nMrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter\nfrom him, had ended in nothing.  Elizabeth had received none\nsince her return that could come from Pemberley.",
        "The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other\nexcuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing,\ntherefore, could be fairly conjectured from that, though\nElizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with\nher own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had she known\nnothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia’s\ninfamy somewhat better.  It would have spared her, she thought,\none sleepless night out of two.",
        "When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\nphilosophic composure.  He said as little as he had ever been in\nthe habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had\ntaken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had\ncourage to speak of it.",
        "It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea,\nthat Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on\nher briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have\nendured, he replied, “Say nothing of that.  Who should suffer\nbut myself?  It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.”",
        "“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.",
        "“You may well warn me against such an evil.  Human nature is\nso prone to fall into it!  No, Lizzy, let me once in my life\nfeel how much I have been to blame.  I am not afraid of being\noverpowered by the impression.  It will pass away soon enough.”",
        "“Do you suppose them to be in London?”",
        "“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”",
        "“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.",
        "“She is happy then,” said her father drily; “and her residence\nthere will probably be of some duration.”",
        "Then after a short silence he continued:",
        "“Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice\nto me last May, which, considering the event, shows some\ngreatness of mind.”",
        "They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her\nmother’s tea.",
        "“This is a parade,” he cried, “which does one good; it gives such\nan elegance to misfortune!  Another day I will do the same; I\nwill sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and\ngive as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till\nKitty runs away.”",
        "“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty fretfully.  “If I\nshould ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”",
        "“_You go to Brighton.  I would not trust you so near it as\nEastbourne for fifty pounds!  No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to\nbe cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.  No officer is ever\nto enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the\nvillage.  Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up\nwith one of your sisters.  And you are never to stir out of doors\ntill you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day\nin a rational manner.”",
        "Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.",
        "“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy.  If you\nare a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review\nat the end of them.”",
