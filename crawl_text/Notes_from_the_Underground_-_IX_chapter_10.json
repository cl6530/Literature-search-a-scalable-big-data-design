        "\nGentlemen, I am joking, and I know myself that my jokes are not\nbrilliant, but you know one can take everything as a joke.  I am, perhaps,\njesting against the grain.  Gentlemen, I am tormented by questions;\nanswer them for me.  You, for instance, want to cure men of their old\nhabits and reform their will in accordance with science and good sense. \nBut how do you know, not only that it is possible, but also that it is\nDESIRABLE to reform man in that way?  And what leads you to the conclusion\nthat man’s inclinations NEED reforming?  In short, how do you know\nthat such a reformation will be a benefit to man?  And to go to the root of\nthe matter, why are you so positively convinced that not to act against his\nreal normal interests guaranteed by the conclusions of reason and arithmetic\nis certainly always advantageous for man and must always be a law\nfor mankind?  So far, you know, this is only your supposition.  It may be\nthe law of logic, but not the law of humanity.  You think, gentlemen,\nperhaps that I am mad?  Allow me to defend myself.  I agree that man is\npre-eminently a creative animal, predestined to strive consciously for an\nobject and to engage in engineering—that is, incessantly and eternally to\nmake new roads, WHEREVER THEY MAY LEAD.  But the reason why he wants\nsometimes to go off at a tangent may just be that he is PREDESTINED to make\nthe road, and perhaps, too, that however stupid the “direct” practical\nman may be, the thought sometimes will occur to him that the road\nalmost always does lead SOMEWHERE, and that the destination it leads to is\nless important than the process of making it, and that the chief thing is to\nsave the well-conducted child from despising engineering, and so giving\nway to the fatal idleness, which, as we all know, is the mother of all the\nvices.  Man likes to make roads and to create, that is a fact beyond dispute. \nBut why has he such a passionate love for destruction and chaos also?  Tell\nme that!  But on that point I want to say a couple of words myself.  May it\nnot be that he loves chaos and destruction (there can be no disputing that\nhe does sometimes love it) because he is instinctively afraid of attaining\nhis object and completing the edifice he is constructing?  Who knows,\nperhaps he only loves that edifice from a distance, and is by no means in\nlove with it at close quarters; perhaps he only loves building it and does\nnot want to live in it, but will leave it, when completed, for the use of\nLES ANIMAUX DOMESTIQUES—such as the ants, the sheep, and so on.  Now the\nants have quite a different taste.  They have a marvellous edifice of that\npattern which endures for ever—the ant-heap.",
        "With the ant-heap the respectable race of ants began and with the ant-\nheap they will probably end, which does the greatest credit to their\nperseverance and good sense.  But man is a frivolous and incongruous\ncreature, and perhaps, like a chess player, loves the process of the game,\nnot the end of it.  And who knows (there is no saying with certainty),\nperhaps the only goal on earth to which mankind is striving lies in this\nincessant process of attaining, in other words, in life itself, and not in the\nthing to be attained, which must always be expressed as a formula, as\npositive as twice two makes four, and such positiveness is not life,\ngentlemen, but is the beginning of death.  Anyway, man has always been\nafraid of this mathematical certainty, and I am afraid of it now.  Granted\nthat man does nothing but seek that mathematical certainty, he traverses\noceans, sacrifices his life in the quest, but to succeed, really to find it,\ndreads, I assure you.  He feels that when he has found it there will be\nnothing for him to look for.  When workmen have finished their work\nthey do at least receive their pay, they go to the tavern, then they are taken\nto the police-station—and there is occupation for a week.  But where can\nman go?  Anyway, one can observe a certain awkwardness about him\nwhen he has attained such objects.  He loves the process of attaining, but\ndoes not quite like to have attained, and that, of course, is very absurd.  In\nfact, man is a comical creature; there seems to be a kind of jest in it all. \nBut yet mathematical certainty is after all, something insufferable.  Twice\ntwo makes four seems to me simply a piece of insolence.  Twice two\nmakes four is a pert coxcomb who stands with arms akimbo barring your\npath and spitting.  I admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing,\nbut if we are to give everything its due, twice two makes five is sometimes\na very charming thing too.",
        "And why are you so firmly, so triumphantly, convinced that only the\nnormal and the positive—in other words, only what is conducive to\nwelfare—is for the advantage of man?  Is not reason in error as regards\nadvantage?  Does not man, perhaps, love something besides well-being?\nPerhaps he is just as fond of suffering?  Perhaps suffering is just as great a\nbenefit to him as well-being?  Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately,\nin love with suffering, and that is a fact.  There is no need to appeal\nto universal history to prove that; only ask yourself, if you are a man and\nhave lived at all.  As far as my personal opinion is concerned, to care only\nfor well-being seems to me positively ill-bred.  Whether it’s good or bad, it\nis sometimes very pleasant, too, to smash things.  I hold no brief for\nsuffering nor for well-being either.  I am standing for ... my caprice, and\nfor its being guaranteed to me when necessary.  Suffering would be out of\nplace in vaudevilles, for instance; I know that.  In the “Palace of Crystal” it\nis unthinkable; suffering means doubt, negation, and what would be the\ngood of a “palace of crystal” if there could be any doubt about it?  And yet\nI think man will never renounce real suffering, that is, destruction and\nchaos.  Why, suffering is the sole origin of consciousness.  Though I did\nlay it down at the beginning that consciousness is the greatest misfortune\nfor man, yet I know man prizes it and would not give it up for any\nsatisfaction.  Consciousness, for instance, is infinitely superior to twice\ntwo makes four.  Once you have mathematical certainty there is nothing\nleft to do or to understand.  There will be nothing left but to bottle up your\nfive senses and plunge into contemplation.  While if you stick to\nconsciousness, even though the same result is attained, you can at least flog\nyourself at times, and that will, at any rate, liven you up.  Reactionary as it\nis, corporal punishment is better than nothing.",
