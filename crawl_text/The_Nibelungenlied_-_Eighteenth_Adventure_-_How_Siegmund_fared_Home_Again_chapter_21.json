        "Then went royal Siegmund / where he Kriemhild found.\nUnto the queen spake he: / “Home must we now be bound.\nWe ween that guests unwelcome / here are we by the Rhine.\nKriemhild, beloved lady, / come now to country that is mine.",
        "1074",
        "“Though from us hath been taken / by foul traitor’s hand\nThy good spouse and noble / here in stranger land,\nThine be it not to suffer: / good friend thou hast in me\nFor sake of son beloved: / thereof shalt thou undoubting be.",
        "1075",
        "“Eke shalt thou have, good lady, / all the power to hold,\nThe which erstwhile hath shown thee / Siegfried the thane full bold.\nThe land and the crown likewise, / be they thine own to call,\nAnd gladly eke shall serve thee / Siegfried’s doughty warriors all.”",
        "1076",
        "Then did they tell the servants / that they thence would ride,\nAnd straight to fetch the horses / these obedient hied.\n’Mid such as so did hate them / it grieved them more to stay:\nLadies high and maidens / were bidden dress them for the way.",
        "1077",
        "When that for royal Siegmund / stood ready horse and man,\nHer kinsmen Lady Kriemhild / to beseech began\nThat she from her mother / would still forbear to go.\nThen spake the lofty lady: / “That might hardly yet be so.",
        "1078",
        "“How might I for ever / look with eyes upon\nHim that to me, poor woman, / such evil thing hath done?\"\nThen spake the youthful Giselher: / “Sister to me full dear,\nBy thy goodness shalt thou / tarry with thy mother here.”",
        "1079",
        "“Who in this wise have harmed thee / and so grieved thy heart,\nThyself may’st spurn their service: / of what is mine take part.\"\nUnto the knight she answered: / “Such thing may never be.\nFor die I must for sorrow / when that Hagen I should see.”",
        "1080",
        "“From need thereof I’ll save thee, / sister full dear to me,\nFor with thy brother Giselher / shalt thou ever be.\nI’ll help to still thy sorrow / that thy husband lieth dead.\"\nThen spake she sorrow-stricken: / “Thereof in sooth had Kriemhild need.”",
        "1081",
        "When that the youthful Giselher / such kindly offer made,\nThen her mother Ute / and Gernot likewise prayed,\nAnd all her faithful kinsmen, / that she would tarry there:\nFor that in Siegfried’s country / but few of her own blood there were.",
        "1082",
        "“To thee they all are strangers,\" / did Gernot further say.\nNor lived yet man so mighty / but dead at last he lay.\nBethink thee that, dear sister, / in comfort of thy mood.\nStay thou amid thy kinsmen, / I counsel truly for thy good.”",
        "1083",
        "To Giselher she promised / that she would tarry there.\nFor the men of Siegmund / the horses ready were,\nWhen they thence would journey / to the Nibelungen land:\nOn carrying-horses laden / the knights’ attire did ready stand.",
        "1084",
        "Went the royal Siegmund / unto Kriemhild then;\nHe spake unto the lady: / “Now do Siegfried’s men\nAwait thee by the horses. / Straight shall we hence away,\nFor ’mid the men of Burgundy / unwilling would I longer stay.”",
        "1085",
        "Then spake the Lady Kriemhild: / “My friends have counselled me,\nThat by the love I bear them, / here my home shall be,\nFor that no kinsmen have I / in the Nibelungen land.\"\nGrieved full sore was Siegmund / when he did Kriemhild understand.",
        "1086",
        "Then spake the royal Siegmund: / “To such give not thine ear,\nA queen ’mid all my kinsmen, / thou a crown shalt wear\nAnd wield as lordly power / as e’er till now thou hast.\nNor thou a whit shalt forfeit, / that we the hero thus have lost.",
        "1087",
        "“And journey with us thither, / for child’s sake eke of thine:\nHim shalt thou never, lady, / an orphan leave to pine.\nWhen hath grown thy son to manhood, / he’ll comfort thee thy mood.\nMeanwhile shall ready serve thee / many a warrior keen and good.”",
        "1088",
        "She spake: “O royal Siegmund, / I may not thither ride,\nFor I here must tarry, / whate’er shall me betide,\n’Mid them that are my kinsmen, / who’ll help my grief to share.\"\nThe knights had sore disquiet / that such tidings they must hear.",
        "1089",
        "“So might we say full truly,\" / spake they every one,\n“That unto us still greater / evil now were done,\nWould’st thou longer tarry / here amid our foes:\nIn sooth were never journey / of knights to court more full of woes.”",
        "1090",
        "“Now may ye free from trouble / in God’s protection fare:\nI’ll bid that trusty escort / shall you have in care\nUnto Siegmund’s country. / My child full dear to me,\nUnto your knights’ good mercy / let it well commended be.”",
        "1091",
        "When that they well perceived / how she would not depart,\nWept all the men of Siegmund / and sad they were at heart.\nIn what right heavy sorrow / Siegmund then took leave\nOf the Lady Kriemhild! / Full sore thereover must he grieve.",
        "1092",
        "“Woe worth this journey hither,\" / the lofty monarch spake.\n“Henceforth from merry meeting / shall nevermore o’ertake\nKing or his faithful kinsmen / what here our meed hath been.\nHere ’mid the men of Burgundy / may we never be more seen.”",
        "1093",
        "Then spake the men of Siegfried / in open words and plain:\n“An might we right discover / who our lord hath slain,\nWarriors bent on vengeance / shall yet lay waste this ground.\nAmong his kin in plenty / may doughty foemen be found.”",
        "1094",
        "Anon he kissed Kriemhild / and spake sorrowfully,\nWhen she there would tarry, / and he the same did see:\n“Now ride we joy-forsaken / home unto our land.\nFirst now what ’tis to sorrow / do I rightly understand.”",
        "1095",
        "From Worms away sans escort / unto the Rhine they rode:\nI ween that they full surely / did go in such grim mood,\nThat had against them any / aught of evil dared,\nHand of keen Nibelungen / had known full well their life to guard.",
        "1096",
        "Nor parting hand they offered / to any that were there.\nThen might ye see how Gernot / and likewise Giselher\nDid give him loving greeting. / That as their very own\nThey felt the wrong he suffered, / by the courteous knights and brave\n      was shown.",
        "1097",
        "Then spake in words full kindly / the royal knight Gernot:\n“God in heaven knoweth / that of guilt I’ve naught\nIn the death of Siegfried, / that e’er I e’en did hear\nWho here to him were hostile. / Well may I of thy sorrow share.”",
        "1098",
        "An escort safe did furnish / the young knight Giselher:\nForth from out that country / he led them full of care,\nThe monarch with his warriors, / to Netherland their home.\nHow joyless is the greeting / as thither to their kin they come!",
        "1099",
        "How fared that folk thereafter, / that can I nowise say.\nHere heard ye Kriemhild plaining / as day did follow day,\nThat none there was to comfort / her heart and sorry mood,\nDid Giselher not do it; / he faithful was to her and good.",
        "1100",
        "The while the fair Queen Brunhild / in mood full haughty sat,\nAnd weep howe’er did Kriemhild, / but little recked she that,\nNor whit to her of pity / displayed she evermore.\nAnon was Lady Kriemhild / eke cause to her of sorrow sore.",
