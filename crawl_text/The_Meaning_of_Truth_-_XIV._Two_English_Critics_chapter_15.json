        "Mr. Bertrand Russell’s article entitled ’Transatlantic Truth,’\n[Footnote: In the Albany Review for January, 1908.] has all the\nclearness, dialectic subtlety, and wit which one expects from his\npen, but it entirely fails to hit the right point of view for\napprehending our position. When, for instance, we say that a\ntrue proposition is one the consequences of believing which are\ngood, he assumes us to mean that any one who believes a proposition\nto be true must first have made out clearly that its consequences be\ngood, and that his belief must primarily be in that fact,–an\nobvious absurdity, for that fact is the deliverance of a\nnew proposition, quite different from the first one and is,\nmoreover, a fact usually very hard to verify, it being ’far easier,’\nas Mr. Russell justly says, ’to settle the plain question of fact:\n“Have popes always been infallible?\"’ than to settle the question\nwhether the effects of thinking them infallible are on the\nwhole good.’",
        "We affirm nothing as silly as Mr. Russell supposes. Good\nconsequences are not proposed by us merely as a sure sign, mark, or\ncriterion, by which truth’s presence is habitually ascertained, tho\nthey may indeed serve on occasion as such a sign; they are proposed\nrather as the lurking motive inside of every truth-claim, whether\nthe ’trower’ be conscious of such motive, or whether he obey it\nblindly. They are proposed as the causa existendi of our beliefs,\nnot as their logical cue or premise, and still less as their\nobjective deliverance or content. They assign the only intelligible\npractical meaning to that difference in our beliefs which our habit\nof calling them true or false comports.",
        "No truth-claimer except the pragmatist himself need ever be aware of\nthe part played in his own mind by consequences, and he himself is\naware of it only abstractly and in general, and may at any moment be\nquite oblivious of it with respect to his own beliefs.",
        "Mr. Russell next joins the army of those who inform their readers\nthat according to the pragmatist definition of the word ’truth’\nthe belief that A exists may be ’true’ even when A does not exist.\nThis is the usual slander repeated to satiety by our critics. They\nforget that in any concrete account of what is denoted by ’truth’ in\nhuman life, the word can only be used relatively to some\nparticular trower. Thus, I may hold it true that Shakespeare wrote\nthe plays that bear his name, and may express my opinion to a\ncritic. If the critic be both a pragmatist and a baconian, he will\nin his capacity of pragmatist see plain that the workings of my\nopinion, I being who I am, make it perfectly true for me, while\nin his capacity of baconian he still believes that Shakespeare never\nwrote the plays in question. But most anti-pragmatist critics take\nthe wont ’truth’ as something absolute, and easily play on their\nreader’s readiness to treat his OWE truths as the absolute ones. If\nthe reader whom they address believes that A does not exist,\nwhile we pragmatists show that those for whom tho belief that it\nexists works satisfactorily will always call it true, he easily\nsneers at the naivete of our contention, for is not then the belief\nin question ’true,’ tho what it declares as fact has, as the reader\nso well knows, no existence? Mr. Russell speaks of our statement as\nan ’attempt to get rid of fact’ and naturally enough considers it ’a\nfailure’ (p. 410). ’The old notion of truth reappears,’ he adds–\nthat notion being, of course, that when a belief is true, its\nobject does exist.",
        "It is, of course, BOUND to exist, on sound pragmatic principles.\nConcepts signify consequences. How is the world made different for\nme by my conceiving an opinion of mine under the concept ’true’?\nFirst, an object must be findable there (or sure signs of such an\nobject must be found) which shall agree with the opinion. Second,\nsuch an opinion must not be contradicted by anything else I am aware\nof. But in spite of the obvious pragmatist requirement that when I\nhave said truly that something exists, it SHALL exist, the\nslander which Mr. Russell repeats has gained the widest currency.",
        "Mr. Russell himself is far too witty and athletic a ratiocinator\nsimply to repeat the slander dogmatically. Being nothing if\nnot mathematical and logical, he must prove the accusation secundum\nartem, and convict us not so much of error as of absurdity. I\nhave sincerely tried to follow the windings of his mind in this\nprocedure, but for the life of me I can only see in it another\nexample of what I have called (above, p. 249) vicious\nabstractionism. The abstract world of mathematics and pure logic is\nso native to Mr. Russell that he thinks that we describers of the\nfunctions of concrete fact must also mean fixed mathematical terms\nand functions. A mathematical term, as a, b, c, x, y, sin., log., is\nself-sufficient, and terms of this sort, once equated, can\nbe substituted for one another in endless series without error. Mr.\nRussell, and also Mr. Hawtrey, of whom I shall speak presently, seem\nto think that in our mouth also such terms as ’meaning,’ ’truth,’\n’belief,’ ’object,’ ’definition,’ are self-sufficients with no\ncontext of varying relation that might be further asked about. What\na word means is expressed by its definition, isn’t it? The\ndefinition claims to be exact and adequate, doesn’t it? Then it can\nbe substituted for the word–since the two are identical–can’t it?\nThen two words with the same definition can be substituted for one\nanother, n’est–ce pas? Likewise two definitions of the same word,\nnicht wahr, etc., etc., till it will be indeed strange if you can’t\nconvict some one of self-contradiction and absurdity.",
        "The particular application of this rigoristic treatment to my own\nlittle account of truth as working seems to be something like what\nfollows. I say ’working’ is what the ’truth’ of our ideas means, and\ncall it a definition. But since meanings and things meant,\ndefinitions and things defined, are equivalent and\ninterchangeable, and nothing extraneous to its definition can be\nmeant when a term is used, it follows that who so calls an idea\ntrue, and means by that word that it works, cannot mean\nanything else, can believe nothing but that it does work, and in\nparticular can neither imply nor allow anything about its object or\ndeliverance. ’According to the pragmatists,’ Mr. Russell writes, ’to\nsay “it is true that other people exist” means “it is useful to\nbelieve that other people exist.” But if so, then these two\nphrases are merely different words for the same\nproposition; therefore when I believe the one, I believe the other’\n(p. 400). [Logic, I may say in passing, would seem to require Mr.\nRussell to believe them both at once, but he ignores\nthis consequence, and considers that other people exist’ and ’it is\nuseful to believe that they do EVEN IF THEY DON’T,’ must be\nidentical and therefore substitutable propositions in the pragmatist\nmouth.]",
        "But may not real terms, I now ask, have accidents not expressed in\ntheir definitions? and when a real value is finally substituted for\nthe result of an algebraic series of substituted definitions, do not\nall these accidents creep back? Beliefs have their objective\n’content’ or ’deliverance’ as well as their truth, and truth has its\nimplications as well as its workings. If any one believe that other\nmen exist, it is both a content of his belief and an implication of\nits truth, that they should exist in fact. Mr. Russell’s logic would\nseem to exclude, ’by definition,’ all such accidents as contents,\nimplications, and associates, and would represent us as translating\nall belief into a sort of belief in pragmatism itself–of\nall things! If I say that a speech is eloquent, and explain\n’eloquent’ as meaning the power to work in certain ways upon the\naudience; or if I say a book is original, and define ’original’ to\nmean differing from other books, Russell’s logic, if I follow it at\nall, would seem to doom me to agreeing that the speech is about\neloquence, and the book about other books. When I call a belief\ntrue, and define its truth to mean its workings, I certainly do not\nmean that the belief is a belief ABOUT the workings. It is a belief\nabout the object, and I who talk about the workings am a different\nsubject, with a different universe of discourse, from that of the\nbeliever of whose concrete thinking I profess to give an account.",
        "The social proposition ’other men exist’ and the pragmatist\nproposition ’it is expedient to believe that other men exist’ come\nfrom different universes of discourse. One can believe the second\nwithout being logically compelled to believe the first; one can\nbelieve the first without having ever heard of the second; or one\ncan believe them both. The first expresses the object of a belief,\nthe second tells of one condition of the belief’s power to maintain\nitself. There is no identity of any kind, save the term ’other men’\nwhich they contain in common, in the two propositions; and to\ntreat them as mutually substitutable, or to insist that we shall do\nso, is to give up dealing with realities altogether.",
        "Mr. Ralph Hawtrey, who seems also to serve under the banner of\nabstractionist logic, convicts us pragmatists of absurdity by\narguments similar to Mr. Russell’s. [Footnote: See The New\nQuarterly, for March, 1908.]",
        "As a favor to us and for the sake of the argument, he abandons the\nword ’true’ to our fury, allowing it to mean nothing but the\nfact that certain beliefs are expedient; and he uses the word\n’correctness’ (as Mr. Pratt uses the word ’trueness’) to designate a\nfact, not about the belief, but about the belief’s object,\nnamely that it is as the belief declares it. ’When therefore,’ he\nwrites, ’I say it is correct to say that Caesar is dead, I mean\n“Caesar is dead.” This must be regarded as the definition of\ncorrectness.’ And Mr. Hawtrey then goes on to demolish me by the\nconflict of the definitions. What is ’true’ for the pragmatist\ncannot be what is ’correct,’ he says, ’for the definitions are not\nlogically interchangeable; or if we interchange them, we reach the\ntautology:",
        "“Caesar is dead” means “it is expedient to believe that Caesar is\ndead.” But what is it expedient to believe? Why, “that Caesar is\ndead.” A precious definition indeed of ’Caesar is dead.’",
        "Mr. Hawtrey’s conclusion would seem to be that the pragmatic\ndefinition of the truth of a belief in no way implies–what?–that\nthe believer shall believe in his own belief’s deliverance?–or that\nthe pragmatist who is talking about him shall believe in that\ndeliverance? The two cases are quite different. For the believer,\nCaesar must of course really exist; for the pragmatist critic he\nneed not, for the pragmatic deliverance belongs, as I have just\nsaid, to another universe of discourse altogether. When one argues\nby substituting definition for definition, one needs to stay in the\nsame universe.",
        "The great shifting of universes in this discussion occurs when we\ncarry the word ’truth’ from the subjective into the objective\nrealm, applying it sometimes to a property of opinions, sometimes to\nthe facts which the opinions assert. A number of writers, as Mr.\nRussell himself, Mr. G. E. Moore, and others, favor the unlucky word\n’proposition,’ which seems expressly invented to foster this\nconfusion, for they speak of truth as a property of ’propositions.’\nBut in naming propositions it is almost impossible not to use the\nword ’that.’",
        "THAT Caesar is dead, THAT virtue is its own reward, are\npropositions.",
        "I do not say that for certain logical purposes it may not be useful\nto treat propositions as absolute entities, with truth or falsehood\ninside of them respectively, or to make of a complex like ’that–\nCaesar–is–dead’ a single term and call it a ’truth.’ But the\n’that’ here has the extremely convenient ambiguity for those\nwho wish to make trouble for us pragmatists, that sometimes it means\nthe FACT that, and sometimes the BELIEF that, Caesar is no longer\nliving. When I then call the belief true, I am told that the truth\nmeans the fact; when I claim the fact also, I am told that my\ndefinition has excluded the fact, being a definition only of a\ncertain peculiarity in the belief–so that in the end I have no\ntruth to talk about left in my possession.",
        "The only remedy for this intolerable ambiguity is, it seems to me,\nto stick to terms consistently. ’Reality,’ ’idea’ or ’belief,’ and\nthe ’truth of the idea or belief,’ which are the terms I have\nconsistently held to, seem to be free from all objection.",
        "Whoever takes terms abstracted from all their natural settings,\nidentifies them with definitions, and treats the latter more\nalgebraico, not only risks mixing universes, but risks fallacies\nwhich the man in the street easily detects. To prove ’by definition’\nthat the statement ’Caesar exists’ is identical with a statement\nabout ’expediency’ because the one statement is ’true’ and the other\nis about ’true statements,’ is like proving that an omnibus is\na boat because both are vehicles. A horse may be defined as a beast\nthat walks on the nails of his middle digits. Whenever we see a\nhorse we see such a beast, just as whenever we believe a ’truth’ we\nbelieve something expedient. Messrs. Russell and Hawtrey, if they\nfollowed their antipragmatist logic, would have to say here that we\nsee THAT IT IS such a beast, a fact which notoriously no one sees\nwho is not a comparative anatomist.",
        "It almost reconciles one to being no logician that one thereby\nescapes so much abstractionism. Abstractionism of the worst sort\ndogs Mr. Russell in his own trials to tell positively what the word\n’truth’ means. In the third of his articles on Meinong, in Mind,\nvol. xiii, p. 509 (1904), he attempts this feat by limiting the\ndiscussion to three terms only, a proposition, its content, and an\nobject, abstracting from the whole context of associated\nrealities in which such terms are found in every case of actual\nknowing. He puts the terms, thus taken in a vacuum, and made into\nbare logical entities, through every possible permutation\nand combination, tortures them on the rack until nothing is left of\nthem, and after all this logical gymnastic, comes out with the\nfollowing portentous conclusion as what he believes to be the\ncorrect view: that there is no problem at all in truth and\nfalsehood, that some propositions are true and some false, just as\nsome roses are red and some white, that belief is a certain attitude\ntowards propositions, which is called knowledge when they are true,\nerror when they are false’–and he seems to think that when once\nthis insight is reached the question may be considered closed\nforever!",
        "In spite of my admiration of Mr. Russell’s analytic powers, I wish,\nafter reading such an article, that pragmatism, even had it no\nother function, might result in making him and other similarly\ngifted men ashamed of having used such powers in such abstraction\nfrom reality. Pragmatism saves us at any rate from such diseased\nabstractionism as those pages show.",
        "P. S. Since the foregoing rejoinder was written an article on\nPragmatism which I believe to be by Mr. Russell has appeared in the\nEdinburgh Review for April, 1909. As far as his discussion of the\ntruth-problem goes, altho he has evidently taken great pains to be\nfair, it seems to me that he has in no essential respect improved\nupon his former arguments. I will therefore add nothing further, but\nsimply refer readers who may be curious to pp. 272-280 of the said\narticle.",
