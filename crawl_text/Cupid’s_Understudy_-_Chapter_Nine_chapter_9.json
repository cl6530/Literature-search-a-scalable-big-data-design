        "At a quarter to four I received a note from Blakely saying it would\nbe impossible for him to come in to tea as he had planned. It was\nthe first time he had ever broken an engagement with me, and I was a\nwee bit unhappy over it, though I knew, of course, there must be\nsome good reason why he couldn’t come. Still, his absence rather put\nme out of humor with tea, so I sent Valentine for a box of\nchocolates. When she returned I sat down with them and a novel,\nprepared to spend the rest of the afternoon alone.",
        "The novel wasn’t half as silly as some I’ve read—the hero reminded\nme of Blakely—and the chocolates were unusually good; I was having\na much better time than I had expected. Then some one knocked at the\ndoor.",
        "“Bother!” I thought. “It can’t be anybody I wish to see; I’ll not\nlet them in.”",
        "The knock, was repeated. It suddenly occurred to me that maybe\nBlakely had changed his plans and had come for tea after all.",
        "“Come in,” I called.",
        "The door opened slowly, and there, standing on the threshold, was—\nHad I gone quite mad? I rose from my chair and stared unbelievingly-\n-at Blakely’s mother.",
        "“May I come in?” she asked in her even, well-bred voice.",
        "“Why—yes,” I faltered.",
        "Closing the door behind her, she walked over to the fireplace.",
        "“Won’t you sit down?” I asked. “No, I thank you. This is not an\nafternoon call, Miss Middleton, it is—But of course you\nunderstand.”",
        "I didn’t understand at all, and her manner of saying I did made me\nfurious.",
        " “Perhaps I am very stupid,” I said, “but I cannot imagine why you\nare here.”",
        "“Do you know where my son is?”",
        "“I do not.”",
        "“You have no idea?”",
        "“I have no idea where your son is, nor why you are here.”",
        "She eyed me intently. How cold and determined she looked and how\nhandsome she was.",
        "“If I thought you were telling the truth—”",
        "“Mrs. Porter!”",
        "She handed me a letter. “Please read that,” she said.",
        "“I will not read it,” I replied. “I must beg that you leave me.”",
        "“There, there, child, I did not mean to be rude.”",
        "“You are more than rude, you are insolent.”",
        "“I am distracted, child. Please read the letter.”",
        "“Very well,” I said, “I’ll read it.”",
        "This was the letter:",
        "“MY DEAR MOTHER: This will be handed to you at four o’clock. At\nthat hour I shall be in Ventura, accompanied by the Grand Duke\nAlexander, and, as we are making the trip by automobile, it may be\nthat we shall neither of us return in time for your dinner this\nevening.”",
        "“If, however, on reading this you will wire me at Ventura your full\nconsent to my marriage with Miss Middleton, I think I can guarantee\nthat your dinner party will be a success.”",
        "“I shall be in Ventura till half past four. Should I fail to hear\nfrom you by that time, we shall continue our journey toward Los\nAngeles as fast as our six-cylinders will take us.”",
        "“It grieves me more than I can tell you to employ this cavalier\nmethod against you, but my softer appeals have been in vain.”",
        "“While not a party to the plot, the duke, I find is something of a\nphilosopher; I do not look for any resistance on his part. If he\ndoes resist, so much the worse for him.”",
        "“Your affectionate son, BLAKELY PORTER.”",
        "“P. S. Please do not think that Miss Middleton has any knowledge of\nthis plan. She has not.”",
        "“P. S. Remember! We leave Ventura for Los Angeles at 4:50 p.m.\nsharp.”",
        "“Mrs. Porter,” I said when I had finished reading the letter, “I am\ndeeply humiliated that Blakely should have done this.”",
        "“Still, I suppose you would marry him if I gave my consent.”",
        "“I would not,” I replied hotly. “I might marry him without your\nconsent, for I love him dearly; but I would never consider you had\ngiven your consent if it were forced from you by trickery.”",
        "“You wouldn’t?”",
        "“I would not.”",
        "“But if he doesn’t bring the duke back my dinner will be ruined.”",
        "“I will telegraph him myself,” I said.",
        "“Supposing he won’t come?”",
        "“Blakely will come if I ask him to.”",
        "“And you will do this for me?”",
        "“No; I am not doing it for you.”",
        "“Then why—”",
        "“Because I cannot bear to have Blakely act so ungenerously toward\nhis mother.”",
        "“He has but used my own weapons against me,” she remarked\nthoughtfully.",
        "“Your weapons are quite unworthy of him, Mrs. Porter.” “The telegram\nmust be dispatched at once,” she announced, glancing impatiently at\nher watch.",
        "“If you will call the office and ask them to send up a boy with some\nforms, I will think over what I wish to say,” I said.",
        "When the boy arrived I had decided upon my message. It was:",
        "“BLAKELY PORTER, Ventura.”",
        "“If you do not return at once with your captive I shall consider\nthat we have never met.”",
        "“ELIZABETH.”",
        "I wrote it out on a form and handed it to Mrs. Porter. “Will that\ndo?” I asked.",
        "She read it at a glance. “Yes,” she said, “it will do. Here, boy,\nsee that this is rushed.”",
        "“I’m glad it was satisfactory,” I said. “Good afternoon, Mrs.\nPorter.”",
        "“My dear girl . . .”",
        "“Good afternoon, Mrs. Porter.”",
        "Still she did not go. I realized her predicament, and was childish\nenough to enjoy it, for Blakely’s mother could not bear to accept a\nfavor from a social inferior. Had I been a child, she would have\npatted me on the head and presented me with a sugar plum. As matters\nstood she was quite at sea; she wished to do something gracious—she\ndidn’t know how.",
        "To make her position more impossible, who should come stalking into\nthe room but Dad,—dear, unsuspecting Dad. When he saw Mrs. Porter\nhe immediately jumped at a whole row of conclusions.",
        "“Well, well well!” he said. “This is a sight that does me good. I’m\nvery glad indeed to see you, Mrs. Porter. Your son has had an idea\nthat you were opposed to meeting Elizabeth; but I knew he couldn’t\nbe right. And here you are; calling on her? Well, well, well!\nElizabeth, haven’t you any tea to offer Blakely’s mother!”",
        "“Mrs. Porter was just leaving” I managed to say. “She has been here\nsome time.”",
        "Dad beamed on us both.",
        "“I told Blakely, Elizabeth couldn’t marry him until you consented,\"\nhe blundered on, “but now I suppose it is all arranged. These\nchildren of ours are wonderfully impatient. I’m as fond of Blakely\nas if he were my own son, and you’ll feel the same about Elizabeth\nwhen you’ve known her longer.”",
        "“Don’t let Dad keep you, Mrs. Porter,” I said. “I’m sure you have\nmany things to attend to.”",
        "Blakely’s mother who had been standing like one in a dream, now woke\nup.",
        "“Yes,” she said, “I must be going. I called informally on Elizabeth\nto beg you both to come to my dinner to-night.”",
        "“I told her we couldn’t possibly come,” I began. “Nonsense! Of\ncourse we can come,” Dad declared. “It will quite upset Blakely if\nyou don’t come, and I shall be so disappointed.”",
        "“There, there,” said Dad, “you’re not going to disappoint Blakely’s\nmother by refusing.”",
        "“No,” I replied. “If Mrs. Porter really wants us we shall be\ndelighted to come.”",
        "“If either of you fails me it will make me most unhappy” she said,\nand there was a note of sincerity, in her voice that was\nunmistakable.",
        "“Thank you,” I murmured. “We shall not fail you.”",
