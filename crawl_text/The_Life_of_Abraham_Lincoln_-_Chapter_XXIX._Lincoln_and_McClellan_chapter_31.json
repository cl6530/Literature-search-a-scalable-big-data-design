        "\nAbraham Lincoln (1809-1865)\n16th President of the United States",
        "\n\n",
        "McClellan was a very different man from Fremont. Though he was as\nnearly as possible opposite in his characteristics, still it was not\neasier to get along with him. He was a man of brilliant talents, fine\nculture, and charming personality. Graduating from West Point in 1846,\nhe went almost immediately into the Mexican War, where he earned his\ncaptaincy. He later wrote a manual of arms for use in the United States\narmy. He visited Europe as a member of the commission of officers to\ngather military information.",
        "His greatest genius was in engineering, a line in which he had no\nsuperior. He went to Illinois in 1857 as chief engineer of the Central\nRailroad, the following year he became vice-president, and the year\nafter that president of the St. Louis and Cincinnati Railway. At the\noutbreak of the war this captain was by the governor of Ohio\ncommissioned as major-general, and a few days later he received from\nLincoln the commission of major-general in the United States army.",
        "He was sent to West Virginia with orders to drive out the rebels. This\nhe achieved in a brief time, and for it he received the thanks of\ncongress. He was, after the disaster at Bull Run, called to Washington\nand placed in command of that portion of the Army of the Potomac whose\nspecific duty was the defense of the capital. He was rapidly promoted\nfrom one position to another until age and infirmity compelled the\nretirement of that grand old warrior, Winfield Scott, whereupon he was\nmade general-in-chief of the United States army. All this occurred in\nless than four months. Four months ago, this young man of thirty-five\nyears was an ex-captain. To-day he is general-in-chief, not of the\nlargest army, but probably of the most intelligent army, the world has\never seen. He would be almost more than human if such a sudden turn of\nthe wheel of fortune did not also turn his head.",
        "It was Lincoln’s habit to let his generals do their work in their own\nways, only insisting that they should accomplish visible and tangible\nresults. This method he followed with McClellan, developing it with\ngreat patience under trying circumstances. On this point there is no\nbetter witness than McClellan himself. To his wife he wrote, “They give\nme my way in everything, full swing and unbounded confidence.” Later he\nexpressed contempt for the President who “showed him too much\ndeference.” He was a universal favorite, he became known as “the young\nNapoleon,” he had the confidence of the country and the loyal devotion\nof the army, and the unqualified support of the administration. Of him\ngreat things were expected, and reasonably so. In the power of\ninspiring confidence and enthusiasm he was second only to Napoleon.",
        "As an organizer and drill-master he was superb. The army after Bull Run\nwas as demoralized as an army could be. The recruits soon began to\narrive from the North, every day bringing thousands of such into\nWashington. These required care and they must be put into shape for\neffective service. This difficult task he accomplished in a way that\nfully met the public expectation and reflected great credit upon\nhimself.",
        "In defense he was a terrible fighter. That is to say, when he fought at\nall–for he fought only in defense–he fought well. A distinguished\nConfederate soldier said, “There was no Union general whom we so much\ndreaded as McClellan. He had, as we thought, no equal.” And they\ndeclared they could always tell when McClellan was in command by the\nway the men fought.",
        "An illustrious comment on this is the splendid fighting at Antietam.\nThat was one of the greatest battles and one of the most magnificent\nvictories of the war. It showed McClellan at his best.",
        "We know what the Army of the Potomac was previous to the accession of\nMcClellan. Let us see what it was after his removal. “McClellan was\nretired,” says the Honorable Hugh McCulloch, “and what happened to the\nArmy of the Potomac? Terrible slaughter under Burnside at\nFredericksburg; crushing defeat at Chancellorsville under Hooker.” All\nthis shows that McClellan narrowly missed the fame of being one of the\ngreatest generals in history. But let us glance at another page in the\nledger.",
        "His first act, when in command at Cincinnati, was to enter into an\nagreement with General Buckner that the state of Kentucky should be\ntreated as neutral territory. That agreement put that state into the\nposition of a foreign country, like England or China, when the very\npurpose of the war was to insist that the United States was one nation.\nThis act was a usurpation of authority, and further, it was\ndiametrically wrong even had he possessed the authority.",
        "His next notable act, one which has already been mentioned, was to\nissue a proclamation in defense of slavery, promising to assist [the\nrebels] to put down any attempt at insurrection by the slaves. This was\nwrong. His duty was to conquer the enemy. It was no more his duty to\ndefend slavery than it was Fremont’s to emancipate the slaves.",
        "The next development of McClellan was the hallucination, from which he\nnever freed himself, that the enemy’s numbers were from five to ten\ntimes as great as they really were. “I am here,” he wrote August 16,\n1861, “in a terrible place; the enemy have from three to four times my\nforce. The President, the old general, cannot or will not see the true\nstate of affairs.” At that time the “true state of affairs” was that\nthe enemy had from one-third to one-half his force. That is a fair\nspecimen of the exaggeration of his fears. That is, McClellan’s\nestimate was from six to twelve times too much.",
        "At Yorktown he faced the Confederate Magruder, who commanded 11,000 all\ntold. Of this number, 6,000 were spread along a line of thirteen miles\nof defense across the peninsula, leaving 5,000 for battle. McClellan’s\nimagination, or fears, magnified this into an enormous army. With his\n58,000 effective troops he industriously prepared for defense, and when\nthe engineering work was accomplished thought he had done a great act\nin defending his army. All the while he was calling lustily for\nreinforcements from Washington. When Magruder was ready he retired with\nhis little army and McClellan’s opportunity was gone.",
        "At Antietam he won a brilliant victory, but he failed to follow it up.\nThere was a chance to annihilate the Confederate army and end the war.\nTo do that was nearly as important as it had been to win the victory.\nTo be sure his troops were worn, but as compared with the shattered\ncondition of the enemy, his army was ready for dress parade. So the\nenemy was allowed to cross the Potomac at leisure, reform, reorganize,\nand the war was needlessly prolonged. It was this neglect which, more\nthan any other one thing, undermined the general confidence in\nMcClellan.",
        "Later, at second Bull Run he left Pope to suffer. It was clearly his\nduty to reinforce Pope, but he only said that Pope had got himself into\nthe fix and he must get out as he could. He seemed to forget that there\nnever was a time when he was not calling for reinforcements himself.\nThis wanton neglect was unsoldierly, inhuman. He also forgot that this\nmethod of punishing Pope inflicted severe punishment on the nation.",
        "His chronic call for reinforcements, were it not so serious, would make\nthe motive of a comic opera. When he was in Washington, he wanted all\nthe troops called in for the defense of the city. When he was in\nVirginia, he thought the troops which were left for the defense of the\ncity ought to be sent to reinforce him,–the city was safe enough! He\ntelegraphed to Governor Denison of Ohio to pay no attention to\nRosecrans’ request for troops. He thought that 20,000, with what could\nbe raised in Kentucky and Tennessee, was enough for the Mississippi\nValley, while he needed 273,000. When he was insisting that Washington\nshould be stripped in order to furnish him with 50,000 additional men,\nthe President asked what had become of his more than 160,000; and in\nhis detailed reply he gave the item of 38,500 absent on leave. Here was\nnearly the number of 50,000 which he asked for, if he would only call\nthem in.",
        "Incidentally to all this were persistent discourtesies to the\nPresident. He would sit silent in the cabinet meetings pretending to\nhave secrets of great importance. Instead of calling on the President\nto report, he made it necessary for the President to call on him. At\nother times he would keep the President waiting while he affected to be\nbusy with subordinates. Once indeed he left the President waiting while\nhe went to bed. All this Lincoln bore with his accustomed patience. He\nplayfully said, when remonstrated with, that he would gladly hold\nMcClellan’s horse if he would only win the battles. This he failed to\ndo. And when he was finally relieved, he had worn out the patience not\nonly of the President, but of his army, and of the entire country. One\nwriter of the day said with much bitterness, but with substantial\ntruth, that “McClellan, with greater means at his command than\nAlexander, Caesar, Napoleon, or Wellington, has lost more men and means\nin his disasters than they in their victories.”",
        "What were the defects of this remarkable man? In the first place, he\nbelieved in slavery. At this late day it is difficult to realize the\ndevotion which some men had for slavery as a “divine institution,\"\nbefore which they could kneel down and pray, as if it was the very ark\nof God. McClellan was one such. And it is not improbable that he early\nhad more than a suspicion that slavery was the real cause of all the\ntrouble. This would in part account for his hesitation.",
        "Then there was a bitter personal hatred between him and Stanton. This\nled him to resent all suggestions and orders emanating from the War\nDepartment. It also made him suspicious of Stanton’s associates,\nincluding the President.",
        "Then he seemed to lack the nerve for a pitched battle. He could do\neverything up to the point of action, but he could not act. This lack\nof nerve is a more common fact in men in all walks of life than is\nusually recognized. He was unconquerable in defense, he did not know\nthe word aggressive. Had he possessed some of the nerve of Sheridan,\nHooker, Sherman, or any one of a hundred others, he would have been one\nof the four great generals of history. But he could not be persuaded or\nforced to attack. His men might die of fever, but not in battle. So far\nas he was concerned, the Army of the Potomac might have been\nreorganizing, changing its base, and perfecting its defenses against\nthe enemy, to this day.",
        "A fatal defect was the endeavor to combine the military and the\npolitical. Few men have succeeded in this. There were Alexander,\nCaesar, Napoleon,–but all came to an untimely end; the first met an\nearly death in a foreign land, the second was assassinated, the third\ndied a prisoner in exile. McClellan and Fremont, with all their\nsplendid talents, made the fatal mistake. They forgot that for the time\nthey were only military men. Grant was not a politician until after his\nmilitary duties were ended.",
        "The conclusion of the relations between Lincoln and McClellan was not\ngenerally known until recently made public by Lincoln’s intimate friend\nLamon. McClellan was nominated in 1864 for President by the democrats.\nAs election day approached it became increasingly clear that McClellan\nhad no chance whatever of being elected. But Lincoln wanted something\nmore than, and different from, a reelection. His desires were for the\nwelfare of the distracted country. He wanted peace, reconstruction,\nprosperity. A few days before election he sent a remarkable proposition\nthrough a common friend, Francis P. Blair, to McClellan. Mr. Blair was\nin hearty sympathy with the plan.",
        "This proposition set forth the hopelessness of McClellan’s chances for\nthe presidency, which he knew perfectly well. It was then suggested\nthat McClellan withdraw from the contest and let the President be\nchosen by a united North, which would bring the war to a speedy close\nand stop the slaughter of men on both sides. The compensations for this\nconcession were to be: McClellan was to be promoted immediately to be\nGeneral of the Army, his father-in-law Marcy was to be appointed major-\ngeneral, and a suitable recognition of the democratic party would be\nmade in other appointments.",
        "At first blush McClellan was in favor of the arrangement. It is\nprobable that if left to himself he would have acceded. The imagination\ncan hardly grasp the fame that would have come to “little Mac,” and the\nblessings that would have come to the reunited country, had this wise\nplan of Lincoln been accepted. But McClellan consulted with friends who\nadvised against it. The matter was dropped,–and that was the end of\nthe history of McClellan. He had thrown away his last chance of success\nand fame. All that followed may be written in one brief sentence: On\nelection day he resigned from the army and was overwhelmingly defeated\nat the polls.",
