        "My dear Henry.–Your pensive favor of the 20th inst., asking for more\nmeans with which to persecute your studies, and also a young man from\nOhio, is at hand and carefully noted.",
        "I would not be ashamed to have you show the foregoing sentence to your\nteacher, if it could be worked, in a quiet way, so as not to look\negotistic on my part. I think myself that it is pretty fair for a man that\nnever had any advantages.",
        "But, Henry, why will you insist on fighting the young man from Ohio? It is\nnot only rude and wrong, but you invariably get licked. There’s where the\nenormity of the thing comes in.",
        "It was this young man from Ohio, named Williams, that you hazed last year,\nor at least that’s what I gether from a letter sent me by your warden. He\nmaintains that you started in to mix Mr. Williams up with the campus in\nsome way, and that in some way Mr. Williams resented it and got his fangs\ntangled up in the bridge of your nose.",
        "You never wrote this to me or to your mother, but I know how busy you are\nwith your studies, and I hope you won’t ever neglect your books just to\nwrite to us.",
        "Your warden, or whoever he is, said that Mr. Williams also hung a\nhand-painted marine view over your eye and put an extra eyelid on one of\nyour ears.",
        "I wish that, if you get time, you would write us about it, because, if\nthere’s anything I can do for you in the arnica line, I would be pleased\nto do so.",
        "The president also says that in the scuffle you and Mr. Williams swapped\nbelts as follows, to-wit: That Williams snatched off the belt of your\nlittle Norfolk jacket, and then gave you one in the eye.",
        "From this I gether that the old prez, as you faseshusly call him, is an\nyoumorist. He is not a very good penman, however; though, so far, his\nwords have all been spelled correct.",
        "I would hate to see you permanently injured, Henry, but I hope that when\nyou try to tramp on the toes of a good boy simply because you are a\nseanyour and he is a fresh, as you frequently state, that he will arise\nand rip your little pleated jacket up the back and make your spinal colyum\nlook like a corderoy bridge in the spring tra la. (This is from a Japan\nshow I was to last week.)",
        "Why should a seanyour in a colledge tromp onto the young chaps that come\nin there to learn? Have you forgot how I fatted up the old cow and beefed\nher so that you could go and monkey with youclid and algebray? Have you\nforgot how the other boys pulled you through a mill pond and made you\ntobogin down hill in a salt barrel with brads in it? Do you remember how\nyour mother went down there to nuss you for two weeks and I stayed to\nhome, and done my own work and the housework too and cooked my own vittles\nfor the whole two weeks?",
        "And now, Henry, you call yourself a seanyour, and therefore, because you\nare simply older in crime, you want to muss up Mr. Williams’s features so\nthat his mother will have to come over and nuss him. I am glad that your\nlittle pleated coat is ripped up the back, Henry, under the circumstances,\nand I am also glad that you are wearing the belt–over your off eye. If\nthere’s anything I can do to add to the hilarity of the occasion, please\nlet me know and I will tend to it.",
        "The lop-horned heifer is a parent once more, and I am trying in my poor,\nweak way to learn her wayward offspring how to drink out of a patent pail\nwithout pushing your old father over into the hay-mow. He is a cute little\nquadruped, with a wild desire to have fun at my expense. He loves to\nswaller a part of my coat-tail Sunday morning, when I am dressed up, and\nthen return it to me in a moist condition. He seems to know that when I\naddress the sabbath school the children will see the joke and enjoy it.",
        "Your mother is about the same, trying in her meek way to adjust herself to\na new set of teeth that are a size too large for her. She has one large\nbunion in the roof of her mouth already, but is still resolved to hold out\nfaithful, and hopes these few lines will find you enjoying the same great\nblessing.",
        "You will find inclosed a dark-blue money-order for four eighty-five. It is\nmoney that I had set aside to pay my taxes, but there is no novelty about\npaying taxes. I’ve done that before, so it don’t thrill me as it used to.",
        "Give my congratulations to Mr. Williams. He has got the elements of\ngreatness to a wonderful degree. If I happened to be participating in that\ncolledge of yours, I would gently but firmly decline to be tromped onto.",
        "So good-bye for this time.",
        "Your Father.",
