        "Mrs. Ranger consented to a third girl, to do the additional heavy work;\nbut a nurse–no! What had Hiram a wife for, and a daughter, and a son, if\nnot to take care of him? What kind of heartlessness was this, to talk of\npermitting a stranger to do the most sacred offices of love? And only by\nbeing on the watch early and late did Adelaide and Arthur prevent her\ndoing everything for him herself.",
        "“Everybody, nowadays, has trained nurses in these cases,” said Dr.\nSchulze. “I don’t think you ought to object to the expense.”",
        "But the crafty taunt left her as indifferent as did the argument from\nwhat “everybody does.”",
        "“I don’t make rules for others,” replied she. “I only say that nobody\nshall touch Hiram but us of his own blood. I won’t hear to it, and the\nchildren won’t hear to it. They’re glad to have the chance to do a little\nsomething for him that has done everything for them.”",
        "The children thus had no opportunity to say whether they would “hear to\nit” or not. But Arthur privately suggested to Adelaide that she ought\nto try to persuade her mother. “It will make her ill, all this extra\nwork,” said he.",
        "“Not so quickly as having some one about interfering with her,\"\nreplied Adelaide.",
        "“Then, too, it looks so bad–so stingy and–and–old-fashioned,” he\npersisted.",
        "“Not from mother’s point of view,” said Adelaide quietly.",
        "Arthur flushed. “Always putting me in the wrong,” he sneered. Then,\ninstantly ashamed of this injustice, he went on in a different tone, “I\nsuppose this sort of thing appeals to the romantic strain in you.”",
        "“And in mother,” said Del.",
        "Whereupon they both smiled. Romantic was about the last word anyone would\nthink of in connection with frankly practical Ellen Ranger. She would\nhave died without hesitation, or lived in torment, for those she loved;\nbut she would have done it in the finest, most matter-of-fact way in the\nworld, and without a gleam of self-conscious heroics, whether of boasting\nor of martyr-meekness or of any other device for signaling attention to\noneself. Indeed, it would not have occurred to her that she was doing\nanything out of the ordinary. Nor, for that matter, would she have been;\nfor, in this world the unheroic are, more often than not, heroes, and the\nheroic usually most unheroic. We pass heroism by to toss our silly caps\nat heroics.",
        "“There are some things, Artie, our education has been taking out of us,\"\ncontinued Del, “that I don’t believe we’re the better for losing. I’ve\nbeen thinking of those things a good deal lately, and I’ve come to the\nconclusion that there really is a rotten streak in what we’ve been\ngetting there in the East–you at Harvard, I at Mrs. Spenser’s Select\nSchool for Young Ladies. There are ways in which mother and father are\nbetter educated than we.”",
        "“It does irritate me,” admitted Arthur, “to find myself caring so much\nabout the looks of things.”",
        "“Especially,” said Adelaide, “when the people whose opinion we are afraid\nof are so contemptibly selfish and snobbish.”",
        "“Still mother and father are narrow-minded,” insisted her brother.",
        "“Isn’t everybody, about people who don’t think as they do?”",
        "“I’ve not the remotest objection to their having their own views,” said\nArthur loftily, “so long as they don’t try to enforce those views on me.”",
        "“But do they? Haven’t we been let do about as we please?”",
        "Arthur shrugged his shoulders. The discussion had led up to property\nagain–to whether or not his father had the right to do as he pleased\nwith his own. And upon that discussion he did not wish to reenter. He had\nnot a doubt of the justice of his own views; but, somehow, to state them\nmade him seem sordid and mercenary, even to himself. Being really\nconcerned for his mother’s health, as well as about “looks,” he strongly\nurged the doctor to issue orders on the subject of a nurse. “If you\ndemand it, mother’ll yield,” he said.",
        "“But I shan’t, young man,” replied Schulze curtly and with a conclusive\nsqueezing together of his homely features. “Your mother is right. She\ngives your father what money can’t buy and skill can’t replace, what has\noften raised the as-good-as-dead. Some day, maybe, you’ll find out what\nthat is. You think you know now, but you don’t.” And there the matter\nrested.",
        "The large room adjoining Hiram and Ellen’s bedroom was made over into a\nsitting room. The first morning on which he could be taken from his bed\nand partially dressed, Mrs. Ranger called in both the children to assist\nher. The three tried to conceal their feelings as they, not without\nphysical difficulty, lifted that helpless form to the invalid’s chair\nwhich Ellen wheeled close to the bedside. She herself wheeled him into\nthe adjoining room, to the window, with strands of ivy waving in and out\nin the gentle breeze, with the sun bright and the birds singing, and all\nthe world warm and vivid and gay. Hiram’s cheeks were wet with tears;\nthey saw some tremendous emotion surging up in him. He looked at Arthur,\nat Adelaide, back to Arthur. Evidently he was trying to say\nsomething–something which he felt must be said. His right arm trembled,\nmade several convulsive twitches, finally succeeded in lifting his right\nhand the few inches to the arm of the chair.",
        "“What is it, father?” said Ellen.",
        "“Yes–yes–yes,” burst from him in thick, straining utterances.\n“Yes–yes–yes.”",
        "Mrs. Ranger wiped her eyes. “He is silent for hours,” she said; “then he\nseems to want to say something. But when he speaks, it’s only as just\nnow. He says ’Yes–yes–yes’ over and over again until his strength\ngives out.”",
        "The bursting of the blood vessels in his brain had torn out the nerve\nconnection between the seat of power of speech and the vocal organs. He\ncould think clearly, could put his thoughts into the necessary words; but\nwhen his will sent what he wished to say along his nerves toward the\nvocal organs, it encountered that gap, and could not cross it.",
        "What did he wish to say? What was the message that could not get through,\nthough he was putting his whole soul into it? At first he would begin\nagain the struggle to speak, as soon as he had recovered from the last\neffort and failure; then the idea came to him that if he would hoard\nstrength, he might gather enough to force a passage for the words–for he\ndid not realize that the connection was broken, and broken forever. So,\nhe would wait, at first for several hours, later for several days; and,\nwhen he thought himself strong enough or could no longer refrain, he\nwould try to burst the bonds which seemed to be holding him. With his\nchildren, or his wife and children, watching him with agonized faces, he\nwould make a struggle so violent, so resolute, that even that dead body\nwas galvanized into a ghastly distortion of tortured life. Always in\nvain; always the same collapse of despair and exhaustion; the chasm\nbetween thought and speech could not be bridged. They brought everything\nthey could think of his possibly wanting; they brought to his room\neveryone with whom he had ever had any sort of more than casual\nrelations–Torrey, among scores of others. But he viewed each object and\neach person with the same awful despairing look, his immobile lips giving\nmuffled passage to that eternal “Yes! Yes! Yes!” And at last they decided\nthey were mistaken, that it was no particular thing he wanted, but only\nthe natural fierce desire to break through those prison walls, invisible,\ntranslucent, intangible, worse than death.",
        "Sorrow and anxiety and care pressed so heavily and so unceasingly upon\nthat household for several weeks that there was no time for, no thought\nof, anything but Hiram. Finally, however, the law of routine mercifully\nreasserted itself; their lives, in habit and in thought, readjusted,\nconformed to the new conditions, as human lives will, however chaotic has\nbeen the havoc that demolished the old routine. Then Adelaide took from\nher writing desk Ross’s letters, which she had glanced at rather than\nread as they came; when she finished the rereading, or reading, she was\nnot only as unsatisfied as when she began, but puzzled, to boot–and\npuzzled that she was puzzled. She read them again–it did not take long,\nfor they were brief; even the first letter after he heard of her father’s\nillness filled only the four sides of one sheet, and was written large\nand loose. “He has sent short letters,” said she, “because he did not\nwant to trouble me with long ones at this time.” But, though this excuse\nwas as plausible as most of those we invent to assist us to believe what\nwe want to believe, it did not quite banish a certain hollow, hungry\nfeeling, a sense of distaste for such food as the letters did provide.\nShe was not experienced enough to know that the expression of the\ncountenance of a letter is telltale beyond the expression of the\ncountenance of its writer; that the face may be controlled to lie, but\nnever yet were satisfying and fully deceptive lies told upon paper.\nWithout being conscious of the action of the sly, subconscious instinct\nwhich prompted it, she began to revolve her friend, Theresa Howland,\nwhose house party Ross was honoring with such an extraordinarily long\nlingering. “I hope Theresa is seeing that he has a good time,” she said.\n“I suppose he thinks as he says–that he’d only be in the way here.\nThat’s a man’s view! It’s selfish, but who isn’t selfish?”",
        "Thus, without her being in the least aware of the process, her mind was\npreparing her for what was about to happen. It is a poor mind, or poorly\nserved by its subconscious half, that is taken wholly by surprise by any\nblow. There are always forewarnings; and while the surface mind\nhabitually refuses to note them, though they be clear as sunset\nsilhouettes, the subconscious mind is not so stupid–so blind under the\nsweet spells of that arch-enchanter, vanity.",
        "At last Ross came, but without sending Adelaide word. His telegram to his\nmother gave just time for a trap to meet him at the station. As he was\nascending the broad, stone approaches of the main entrance to the house\nat Point Helen, she appeared in the doorway, her face really beautiful\nwith mother-pride. For Janet she cared as it is the duty of parent to\ncare for child; Ross she loved. It was not mere maternal imagination that\nmade her so proud of him; he was a distinguished and attractive figure of\nthe kind that dominates the crowds at football games, polo and tennis\nmatches, summer resort dances, and all those events which gather together\nthe youth of our prosperous classes. Of the medium height, with a strong\nlook about the shoulders, with sufficiently, though not aggressively,\npositive features and a clear skin, with gray-green eyes, good teeth, and\na pleasing expression, he had an excellent natural basis on which to\nbuild himself into a particularly engaging and plausible type of\nfashionable gentleman. He was in traveling tweeds of pronounced plaid\nwhich, however, he carried off without vulgarity. His trousers were\nrolled high, after the fashion of the day, to show dark red socks of the\nsame color as his tie and of a shade harmonious to the stripe in the\npattern of shirt and suit and to the stones in his cuff links. He looked\nclean, with the cleanness of a tree after the measureless drenching of a\nstorm; he had a careless, easy air, which completely concealed his\nassiduous and self-complacent self-consciousness. He embraced his mother\nwith enthusiasm.",
        "“How well you look!” he exclaimed; then, with a glance round, “How well\neverything looks!”",
        "His mother held tightly to his arm as they went into the house; she\nseemed elder sister rather than mother, and he delighted her by\ntelling her so–omitting the qualifying adjective before the sister.\n“But you’re not a bit glad to see me,” he went on. “I believe you don’t\nwant me to come.”",
        "“I’m just a little cross with you for not answering my letters,\"\nreplied she.",
        "“How is Del?” he asked, and for an instant he looked embarrassed and\ncuriously ashamed of himself.",
        "“Adelaide is very well,” was her reply in a constrained voice.",
        "“I couldn’t stay away any longer,” said he. “It was tiresome up at\nWindrift.”",
        "He saw her disappointment, and a smile flitted over his face which\nreturned and remained when she said: “I thought you were finding Theresa\nHowland interesting.”",
        "“Oh, you did?” was his smiling reply. “And why?”",
        "“Then you have come because you were bored?” she said, evading.",
        "“And to see you and Adelaide. I must telephone her right away.”",
        "It seemed to be secretly amusing him to note how downcast she was by\nthis enthusiasm for Adelaide. “I shouldn’t be too eager,” counseled\nshe. “A man ought never to show eagerness with a woman. Let the women\nmake the advances, Ross. They’ll do it fast enough–when they find that\nthey must.”",
        "“Not the young ones,” said Ross. “Especially not those that have choice\nof many men.”",
        "“But no woman has choice of many men,” replied she. “She wants the best,\nand when you’re in her horizon, you’re the best, always.”",
        "Ross, being in the privacy of his own family, gave himself the pleasure\nof showing that he rather thought so himself. But he said: “Nonsense. If\nI listened to your partiality, I’d be making a fearful ass of myself most\nof the time.”",
        "“Well–don’t let Adelaide see that you’re eager,” persisted his\nmother subtly. “She’s very good-looking and knows it and I’m afraid\nshe’s getting an exaggerated notion of her own value. She feels socertain of you.”",
        "“Of course she does,” said Ross, and his mother saw that he was unmoved\nby her adroit thrust at his vanity.",
        "“It isn’t in human nature to value what one feels sure of.”",
        "“But she is sure of me,” said Ross, and while he spoke with\nemphasis, neither his tone nor his look was quite sincere. “We’re\nengaged, you know.”",
        "“A boy and girl affair. But nothing really settled.”",
        "“I’ve given my word and so has she.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney had difficulty in not looking as disapproving as she felt.\nA high sense of honor had been part of her wordy training of her\nchildren; but she had relied–she hoped, not in vain–upon their common\nsense to teach them to reconcile and adjust honor to the exigencies of\npractical life. “That’s right, dear,” said she. “A man or a woman can’t\nbe too honorable. Still, I should not wish you to make her and yourself\nunhappy. And I know both of you would be unhappy if, by marrying, you\nwere to spoil each other’s careers. And your father would not be able\nto allow or to leave you enough to maintain an establishment such as\nI’ve set my heart on seeing you have. Mr. Ranger has been acting very\nstrange of late–almost insane, I’d say.” Her tone became constrained\nas if she were trying to convey more than she dared put into words. “I\nfeel even surer than when I wrote you, that he’s leaving a large part\nof his fortune to Tecumseh College.” And she related–with judicious\nomissions and embroideries–her last talk with Hiram, and the events\nthat centered about it.",
        "Ross retained the impassive expression he had been cultivating ever since\nhe read in English “high life” novels descriptions of the bearing of men\nof the ’haut monde.” “That’s of no consequence,” was his comment, in a\ntone of indifference. “I’m not marrying Del for her money.”",
        "“Don’t throw yourself away, Ross,” said she, much disquieted. “I feel\nsure you’ve been brought up too sensibly to do anything reckless. At\nleast, be careful how you commit yourself until you are sure. In our\nstation people have to think of a great many things before they think of\nanything so uncertain and so more or less fanciful as love. Rest assured,\nAdelaide is thinking of those things. Don’t be less wise than she.”",
        "He changed the subject, and would not go back to it; and after a few\nminutes he telephoned Adelaide, ordered a cart, and set out to take her\nfor a drive. Mrs. Whitney watched him depart with a heavy heart and so\npiteous a face that Ross was moved almost to the point of confiding in\nher what he was pretending not to admit to himself. “Ross is sensible\nbeyond his years,” she said to herself sadly, “but youth is soromantic. It never can see beyond the marriage ceremony.”",
        "Adelaide, with as much haste as was compatible with the demands of so\nimportant an occasion, was getting into a suitable costume. Suddenly she\nlaid aside the hat she had selected from among several that were what the\nFifth Avenue milliners call the ’dernier cri.” “No, I’ll not go!” she\nexclaimed.",
        "Ever since her father was stricken she had stayed near him. Ellen had his\ncomfort and the household to look after, and besides was not good at\ninitiating conversation and carrying it on alone; Arthur’s tongue was\nparalyzed in his father’s presence by his being unable for an instant to\nforget there what had occurred between them. So Del had borne practically\nthe whole burden of filling the dreary, dragging hours for him–who could\nnot speak, could not even show whether he understood or not. He had never\nbeen easy to talk to; now, when she could not tell but that what she said\njarred upon a sick and inflamed soul, aggravating his torture by\nreminding him of things he longed to know yet could not inquire about,\ntantalizing him with suggestions–She dared not let her thoughts go far\nin that direction; it would soon have been impossible to send him any\nmessage beyond despairing looks.",
        "Sometimes she kissed him. She knew he was separated from her as by a\nheavy, grated prison door, and was unable to feel the electric thrill\nof touch; yet she thought he must get some joy out of the sight of\nthe dumb show of caress. Again, she would give up trying to look\ncheerful, and would weep–and let him see her weep, having an instinct\nthat he understood what a relief tears were to her, and that she let\nhim see them to make him feel her loving sympathy. Again, she would be\nso wrought upon by the steady agony of those fixed eyes that she would\nleave him abruptly to hide herself and shudder, tearless, at the utter\nmisery and hopelessness of it all. She wondered at her mother’s calm\nuntil she noticed, after a few weeks, how the face was withering with\nthat shriveling which comes from within when a living thing is dying\nat the core.",
        "She read the Bible to him, selecting consolatory passage with the aid of\na concordance, in the evenings after he had been lifted into bed for the\nnight. She was filled with protest as she read; for it seemed to her that\nthis good man, her best of fathers, thus savagely and causelessly\nstricken, was proof before her eyes that the sentences executed against\nmen were not divine, but the devilish emanations of brute chance. “There\nmay be a devil,” she said to herself, frightened at her own blasphemy,\n“but there certainly is no God.” Again, the Bible’s promises, so\nconfident, so lofty, so marvelously responsive to the longings and\ncravings of every kind of desolation and woe, had a soothing effect upon\nher; and they helped to put her in the frame of mind to find for\nconversation–or, rather, for her monologues to him–subjects which her\ninstinct told her would be welcome visitors in that prison.",
        "She talked to him of how he was loved, of how noble his influence had\nbeen in their lives. She analyzed him to himself, saying things she would\nnever have dared say had there been the slightest chance of so much\nresponse as the flutter of an eyelid. And as, so it seemed to her, the\nsympathetic relations and understanding between them grew, she became\nfranker, talked of her aspirations–new-born aspirations in harmony with\nhis life and belief. And, explaining herself for his benefit and bringing\nto light her inmost being to show to him, she saw it herself. And when\nshe one day said to him, “Your illness has made a better woman of me,\nfather, dear father,” she felt it with all her heart.",
        "It was from this atmosphere, and enveloped in it, that she went out to\ngreet Ross; and, as she went, she was surprised at her own calmness\nbefore the prospect of seeing him again, after six months’\nseparation–the longest in their lives.",
        "His expression was scrupulously correct–joy at seeing her shadowed by\nsympathy for her calamity. When they were safely alone, he took her hand\nand was about to kiss her. Her beauty was of the kind that is different\nfrom, and beyond, memory’s best photograph. She never looked exactly the\nsame twice; that morning she seemed to him far more tempting than he had\nbeen thinking, with his head for so many weeks full of worldly ideas. He\nwas thrilled anew, and his resolve hesitated before the fine pallor of\nher face, the slim lines of her figure, and the glimpses of her smooth\nwhite skin through the openwork in the yoke and sleeves of her blouse.\nBut, instead of responding she drew back, just a little. He instantly\nsuspected her of being in the state of mind into which he had been trying\nto get himself. He dropped her hand. A trifling incident, but a trifle is\nenough to cut the communications between two human beings; it often\naccomplishes what the rudest shocks would not. They went to the far,\nsecluded end of the garden, he asking and she answering questions about\nher father.",
        "“What is it, Del?” he said abruptly, at length. “You act strained toward\nme.” He did not say this until she had been oppressed almost into silence\nby the height and the thickness of the barrier between them.",
        "“I guess it’s because I’ve been shut in with father,” she suggested.\n“I’ve seen no one to talk to, except the family and the doctor, for\nweeks.” And she tried to fix her mind on how handsome and attractive he\nwas. As a rebuke to her heart’s obstinate lukewarmness she forced herself\nto lay her hand in his.",
        "He held it loosely. Her making this slight overture was enough to\nrestore his sense of superiority; his resolve grew less unsteady. “It’s\nthe first time,” he went on, “that we’ve really had the chance to judge\nhow we actually feel toward each other–that’s what’s the matter.” His\nface–he was not looking at her–took on an expression of sad reproach.\n“Del, I don’t believe you–care. You’ve found it out, and don’t want to\nhurt my feelings by telling me.” And he believed what he was saying. It\nmight have been–well, not quite right, for him to chill toward her and\ncontemplate breaking the engagement, but that she should have been doing\nthe same thing–his vanity was erect to the last feather. “It’s most kind\nof you to think so considerately of me,” he said satirically.",
        "She took her hand away. “And you?” she replied coldly. “Are your\nfeelings changed?”",
        "“I–oh, you know I love you,” was his answer in a deliberately\ncareless tone.",
        "She laughed with an attempt at raillery. “You’ve been too long up at\nWindrift–you’ve been seeing too much of Theresa Howland,” said she,\nmerely for something to say; for Theresa was neither clever nor pretty,\nand Del hadn’t it in her to suspect him of being mercenary.",
        "He looked coldly at her. “I have never interfered with your many\nattentions from other men,” said he stiffly. “On the contrary, I have\nencouraged you to enjoy yourself, and I thought you left me free in the\nsame way.”",
        "The tears came to her eyes; and he saw, and proceeded to value still less\nhighly that which was obviously so securely his.",
        "“Whatever is the matter with you, Ross, this morning?” she cried. “Or is\nit I? Am I–”",
        "“It certainly is not I,” he interrupted icily. “I see you again after six\nmonths, and I find you changed completely.”",
        "A glance from her stopped him. “Oh!” she exclaimed, with a dangerous\nsmile. “You are out of humor this morning and are seeking a quarrel.”",
        "“That would be impossible,” he retorted. ’I never quarrel. Evidently\nyou have forgotten all about me.”",
        "Her pride would not let her refuse the challenge, convert in his words,\nfrank in his eyes.",
        "“Possibly,” mocked she, forcing herself to look amusedly at him. “I don’t\nbother much about people I don’t see.”",
        "“You take a light view of our engagement,” was his instant move.",
        "“I should take a still lighter view,” retorted she, “if I thought the way\nyou’re acting was a fair specimen of your real self.”",
        "This from Adelaide, who had always theretofore shared in his almost\nreverent respect for himself. Adelaide judging him, criticising him!\nAll Ross’s male instinct for unquestioning approval from the female was\nastir. “You wish to break our engagement?” he inquired, with a glance of\ncold anger that stiffened her pride and suppressed her impulse to try to\ngain time.",
        "“You’re free,” said she, and her manner so piqued him, that to nerve\nhimself to persist he had to think hard on the magnificence of Windrift\nand the many Howland millions and the rumored Ranger will. She, in a\nseries of jerks and pauses, took off the ring; with an expression and a\ngesture that gave no further hint of how she had valued it, both for its\nown beauty and for what it represented, she handed it to him. “If that’s\nall,” she went on, “I’ll go back to father.” To perfect her pretense, she\nshould have risen, shaken hands cheerfully with him, and sent him\ncarelessly away. She knew it; but she could not.",
        "He was not the man to fail to note that she made no move to rise, or to\nfail to read the slightly strained expression in her eyes and about the\ncorners of her mouth. That betrayal lost Adelaide a triumph; for, seeing\nher again, feeling her beauty and her charm in all his senses, reminded\nof her superiority in brains and in taste to the women from whom he might\nchoose, he was making a losing fight for the worldly wise course.\n“Anyhow, I must tame her a bit,” he reflected, now that he was sure she\nwould be his, should he find on further consideration that he wanted her\nrather than Theresa’s fortune. He accordingly took his hat, drew himself\nup, bowed coldly.",
        "“Good morning,” he said. And he was off, down the drive–to the lower end\nwhere the stableboy was guarding his trap–he was seated–he was driving\naway–he was gone–gone!",
        "She did not move until he was no longer in sight. Then she rushed into\nthe house, darted up to her room, locked herself in and gave way. It was\nthe first serious quarrel she had ever had with him; it was so little\nlike a quarrel, so ominously like a–No; absurd! It could not be a\nfinality. She rejected that instantly, so confident had beauty and\nposition as a prospective heiress made her as to her powers over any man\nshe chose to try to fascinate, so secure was she in the belief that Ross\nloved her and would not give her up in any circumstances. She went over\ntheir interview, recalled his every sentence and look–this with\nsurprising coolness for a young woman as deeply in love as she fancied\nherself. And her anger rose against him–a curious kind of anger, to\nspring and flourish in a loving heart. “He has been flattered by Theresa\nuntil he has entirely lost his point of view,” she decided. “I’ll give\nhim a lesson when he comes trying to make it up.”",
        "He drove the part of his homeward way that was through streets with his\nwonted attention to “smartness.” True “man of the world,” he never for\nmany consecutive minutes had himself out of his mind–how he was\nconducting himself, what people thought of him, what impression he had\nmade or was making or was about to make. He estimated everybody and\neverything instinctively and solely from the standpoint of advantage to\nhimself. Such people, if they have the intelligence to hide themselves\nunder a pleasing surface, and the wisdom to plan, and the energy to\nexecute, always get just about what they want; for intelligence and\nenergy are invincible weapons, whether the end be worthy or not. As soon,\nhowever, as he was in the road up to the Bluffs, deserted at that hour,\nhis body relaxed, his arms and hands dropped from the correct angle for\ndriving, the reins lay loose upon the horse’s back, and he gave himself\nto dejection. He had thought–at Windrift–that, once he was free from\nthe engagement which was no longer to his interest, he would feel\nbuoyant, elated. Instead, he was mentally even more downcast a figure\nthan his relaxed attitude and gloomy face made him physically. His\nmother’s and his “set’s” training had trimmed generous instincts close to\nthe roots, and, also, such ideals as were not purely for material\nmatters, especially for ostentation. But, being still a young man, those\nroots not only were alive, but also had an under-the-soil vigor; they\neven occasionally sent to the surface sprouts–that withered in the\nuncongenial air of his surroundings and came to nothing. Just now these\nsprouts were springing in the form of self-reproaches. Remembering with\nwhat thoughts he had gone to Adelaide, he felt wholly responsible for the\nbroken engagement, felt that he had done a contemptible thing, had done\nit in a contemptible way; and he was almost despising himself, looking\nabout the while for self-excuses. The longer he looked the worse off he\nwas; for the more clearly he saw that he was what he called, and thought,\nin love with this fresh young beauty, so swiftly and alluringly\ndeveloping. It exasperated him with the intensity of selfishness’s\navarice that he could not have both Theresa Howland’s fortune and\nAdelaide. It seemed to him that he had a right to both. Not in the coldly\nselfish only is the fact of desire in itself the basis of right. By the\ntime he reached home, he was angry through and through, and bent upon\nfinding some one to be angry with. He threw the reins to a groom and,\nsavagely sullen of face, went slowly up the terrace-like steps.",
        "His mother, on the watch for his return, came to meet him. “How is Mr.\nRanger this morning?” she asked.",
        "“Just the same,” he answered curtly.",
        "“And–Del?”",
        "No answer.",
        "They went into the library; he lit a cigarette and seated himself at the\nwriting table. She watched him anxiously but had far too keen insight to\nspeak and give him the excuse to explode. Not until she turned to leave\nthe room did he break his surly silence to say: “I might as well tell\nyou. I’m engaged to Theresa Howland.”",
        "“O Ross, I’m so glad!” she exclaimed, lighting up with pride and\npleasure. Then, warned by his expression, she restrained herself. “I have\nfelt certain for a long time that you would not throw yourself away on\nAdelaide. She is a nice girl–pretty, sweet, and all that. But women\ndiffer from each other only in unimportant details. A man ought to see to\nit that by marrying he strengthens his influence and position in the\nworld and provides for the standing of his children. And I think Theresa\nhas far more steadiness; and, besides, she has been about the world–she\nwas presented at court last spring a year ago, wasn’t she? She is sucha lady. It will be so satisfactory to have her as the head of your\nestablishment–probably Mr. Howland will give her Windrift. And her\ncousin–that Mr. Fanning she married–is connected with all the best\nfamilies in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. They are at the top of\nour aristocracy.”",
        "This recital was not to inform, but to inspire–to remind him what a wise\nand brilliant move he had made in the game of life. And it had precisely\nthe effect she intended. Had she not herself created and fostered in him\nthe nature that would welcome such stuff as a bat welcomes night?",
        "“I’m going back to Windrift to-morrow,” he said, still sullen, but with\nthe note of the quarrel-seeker gone from his voice.",
        "“When do you wish me to write to her?”",
        "“Whenever you like,” he said. The defiance in his tone was for Adelaide.\n“The engagement is to be announced as soon as I get back.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney was called away, and Ross tried to write to Theresa. But the\nwords wouldn’t come. He wandered restlessly about the room, ordered the\nelectric, went to the Country Club. After an hour of bitterness, he\ncalled up his mother. “You needn’t send that note we were talking about\njust yet,” he said.",
        "“But I’ve already sent it,” his mother answered. In fact, the note was\njust then lying on the table at her elbow.",
        "“What were you in such a devil of a hurry for?” he stormed–an\nunnecessary question, for he knew his mother was the sort of person\nthat loses no time in settling an important matter beyond possibility\nof change.",
        "“I’m sorry, Ross,” she replied soothingly. “I thought I might as well\nsend it, as you had told me everything was settled.”",
        "“Oh–all right–no matter.” He could break with Theresa whenever he\nwished. Perhaps he would not wish to break with her; perhaps, after a few\ndays he would find that his feeling for Adelaide was in reality no\nstronger than he had thought it at Windrift, when Theresa was tempting\nhim with her huge fortune. There was plenty of time before it would be\nnecessary to make final choice.",
        "Nevertheless, he did not leave Saint X, but hung round, sour and morose,\nhoping for some sign from “tamed” Adelaide.",
        "As soon as Theresa got Mrs. Whitney’s note, she wrote to Adelaide. “I’ve\npromised not to tell,” her letter began, “but I never count any promise\nof that kind as including you, dear, sweet Adelaide–”",
        "Adelaide smiled as she read this; Theresa’s passion for intimate\nconfession had been the joke of the school. “Besides,” Adelaide read on,\n“I think you’ll be especially interested as Ross tells me there was some\nsort of a boy-and-girl flirtation between you and him. I don’t see how\nyou could get over it. Now–you’ve guessed. Yes–we’re engaged, and will\nprobably be married up here in the fall–Windrift is simply divine then,\nyou know. And I want you to be my ’best man.’ The others’ll be Edna and\nClarice and Leila and Annette and perhaps Jessie and Anita. We’re to live\nin Chicago–father will give us a house, I’m sure. And you must come to\nvisit us–”",
        "It is hardly fair to eavesdrop upon a young woman in such an hour as\nthis of Adelaide’s. Only those might do so who are willing freely to\nconcede to others that same right to be human which they themselves\nexercise, whether they will or no, when things happen that smash the\nveneer of “gentleman” or “lady” like an eggshell under a plowboy’s heel,\nand penetrate to and roil that unlovely human nature which is in us all.\nCriticism is supercilious, even when it is just; so, without criticism,\nthe fact is recorded that Adelaide paced the floor and literally raved in\nher fury at this double-distilled, double treachery. The sense that she\nhad lost the man she believed she loved was drowned in the oceanic flood\nof infuriated vanity. She raged now against Ross and now against Theresa\n“She’s marrying him just because she’s full of envy, and can’t bear to\nsee anybody else have anything,” she fumed. “Theresa couldn’t love\nanybody but herself. And he–he’s marrying her for her money. She isn’t\ngood to look at; to be in the house with her is to find out how mean and\nsmall and vain she is. It serves me right for being snob enough to have\nsuch a friend. If she hadn’t been immensely rich and surrounded by such\nbeautiful things I’d never have had anything to do with her. She’s buying\nhim; he’s selling himself. How vile!”",
        "But the reasons why they were betraying her did not change or mitigate\nthe fact of betrayal; and that fact showed itself to proud, confident\nAdelaide Ranger in the form of the proposition that she had been jilted,\nand that all the world, all her world, would soon know it. Jilted!\nShe–Adelaide Ranger–the all-conqueror–flung aside, flouted, jilted.\nShe went back to that last word; it seemed to concentrate all the insult\nand treason and shame that were heaped upon her. And she never once\nthought of the wound to her heart; the fierce fire of vanity seemed to\nhave cauterized it–if there was a wound.",
        "What could she do to hide her disgrace from her mocking, sneering\nfriends? For, hide it she must–must–must! And she had not a\nmoment to lose.",
        "A little thought, and she went to the telephone and called up her brother\nat the Country Club. When she heard his voice, in fear and fright,\ndemanding what she wanted, she said:",
        "“Will you bring Dory Hargrave to dinner to-night? And, of course, don’t\nlet him know I wanted you to.”",
        "“Is that all!” exclaimed Arthur in a tone of enormous relief, which she\nwas too absorbed in her calamity to be conscious of.",
        "“You will, won’t you? Really, Arthur, it’s very important; and don’t\nsay a word of my having telephoned–not to anybody.”",
        "“All right! I’ll bring him.” A pause, then. “Father’s just the same?”",
        "“Yes,” she answered, in sudden confusion and shame.",
