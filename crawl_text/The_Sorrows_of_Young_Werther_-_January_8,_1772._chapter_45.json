        "What beings are men, whose whole thoughts are occupied with form\nand ceremony, who for years together devote their mental and\nphysical exertions to the task of advancing themselves but one\nstep, and endeavouring to occupy a higher place at the table. Not\nthat such persons would otherwise want employment: on the contrary,\nthey give themselves much trouble by neglecting important business\nfor such petty trifles. Last week a question of precedence arose\nat a sledging-party, and all our amusement was spoiled.",
        "The silly creatures cannot see that it is not place which constitutes\nreal greatness, since the man who occupies the first place but\nseldom plays the principal part. How many kings are governed by\ntheir ministers — how many ministers by their secretaries? Who, in\nsuch cases, is really the chief? He, as it seems to me, who can\nsee through the others, and possesses strength or skill enough to\nmake their power or passions subservient to the execution of his\nown designs.",
