        "  To Joseph W. Allen,\n  at whose suggestion this story was undertaken,\n  it is inscribed with friendly regard.",
        "“Ragged Dick” was contributed as a serial story to the pages of the\nSchoolmate, a well-known juvenile magazine, during the year 1867.\nWhile in course of publication, it was received with so many\nevidences of favor that it has been rewritten and considerably\nenlarged, and is now presented to the public as the first volume\nof a series intended to illustrate the life and experiences of the\nfriendless and vagrant children who are now numbered by thousands\nin New York and other cities.",
        "Several characters in the story are sketched from life. The\nnecessary information has been gathered mainly from personal\nobservation and conversations with the boys themselves. The author\nis indebted also to the excellent Superintendent of the Newsboys’\nLodging House, in Fulton Street, for some facts of which he has been\nable to make use. Some anachronisms may be noted. Wherever they\noccur, they have been admitted, as aiding in the development of the\nstory, and will probably be considered as of little importance in\nan unpretending volume, which does not aspire to strict historical\naccuracy.",
        "The author hopes that, while the volumes in this series may prove\ninteresting stories, they may also have the effect of enlisting the\nsympathies of his readers in behalf of the unfortunate children whose\nlife is described, and of leading them to co-operate with the\npraiseworthy efforts now making by the Children’s Aid Society and\nother organizations to ameliorate their condition.",
        "New York, April, 1868",
        "“Wake up there, youngster,” said a rough voice.",
        "Ragged Dick opened his eyes slowly, and stared stupidly in the face\nof the speaker, but did not offer to get up.",
        "“Wake up, you young vagabond!” said the man a little impatiently;\n\"I suppose you’d lay there all day, if I hadn’t called you.”",
        "“What time is it?” asked Dick.",
        "“Seven o’clock.”",
        "“Seven o’clock! I oughter’ve been up an hour ago. I know what ’twas\nmade me so precious sleepy. I went to the Old Bowery last night, and\ndidn’t turn in till past twelve.”",
        "“You went to the Old Bowery? Where’d you get your money?” asked the\nman, who was a porter in the employ of a firm doing business on\nSpruce Street. “Made it by shines, in course. My guardian don’t\nallow me no money for theatres, so I have to earn it.”",
        "“Some boys get it easier than that,” said the porter significantly.",
        "“You don’t catch me stealin’, if that’s what you mean,” said Dick.",
        "“Don’t you ever steal, then?”",
        "“No, and I wouldn’t. Lots of boys does it, but I wouldn’t.”",
        "“Well, I’m glad to hear you say that. I believe there’s some\ngood in you, Dick, after all.”",
        "“Oh, I’m a rough customer!” said Dick. “But I wouldn’t steal.\nIt’s mean.”",
        "“I’m glad you think so, Dick,” and the rough voice sounded gentler\nthan at first. “Have you got any money to buy your breakfast?”",
        "“No, but I’ll soon get some.”",
        "While this conversation had been going on, Dick had got up. His\nbedchamber had been a wooden box half full of straw, on which the\nyoung boot-black had reposed his weary limbs, and slept as soundly\nas if it had been a bed of down. He dumped down into the straw\nwithout taking the trouble of undressing.",
        "Getting up too was an equally short process. He jumped out of the\nbox, shook himself, picked out one or two straws that had found\ntheir way into rents in his clothes, and, drawing a well-worn cap\nover his uncombed locks, he was all ready for the business of the\nday.",
        "Dick’s appearance as he stood beside the box was rather peculiar.\nHis pants were torn in several places, and had apparently belonged\nin the first instance to a boy two sizes larger than himself. He\nwore a vest, all the buttons of which were gone except two, out of\nwhich peeped a shirt which looked as if it had been worn a month.\nTo complete his costume he wore a coat too long for him, dating\nback, if one might judge from its general appearance, to a remote\nantiquity.",
        "Washing the face and hands is usually considered proper in\ncommencing the day, but Dick was above such refinement. He had no\nparticular dislike to dirt, and did not think it necessary to remove\nseveral dark streaks on his face and hands. But in spite of his dirt\nand rags there was something about Dick that was attractive. It was\neasy to see that if he had been clean and well dressed he would\nhave been decidedly good-looking. Some of his companions were sly,\nand their faces inspired distrust; but Dick had a frank,\nstraight-forward manner that made him a favorite.",
        "Dick’s business hours had commenced. He had no office to open. His\nlittle blacking-box was ready for use, and he looked sharply in\nthe faces of all who passed, addressing each with, “Shine yer\nboots, sir?”",
        "“How much?” asked a gentleman on his way to his office.",
        "“Ten cents,” said Dick, dropping his box, and sinking upon his knees\non the sidewalk, flourishing his brush with the air of one skilled\nin his profession.",
        "“Ten cents! Isn’t that a little steep?”",
        "“Well, you know ’taint all clear profit,” said Dick, who had already\nset to work. “There’s the blacking costs something, and I have to\nget a new brush pretty often.”",
        "“And you have a large rent too,” said the gentleman quizzically,\nwith a glance at a large hole in Dick’s coat.",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Dick, always ready to joke; “I have to pay such a\nbig rent for my manshun up on Fifth Avenoo, that I can’t afford to\ntake less than ten cents a shine. I’ll give you a bully shine, sir.”",
        "“Be quick about it, for I am in a hurry. So your house is on Fifth\nAvenue, is it?”",
        "“It isn’t anywhere else,” said Dick, and Dick spoke the truth there.",
        "“What tailor do you patronize?” asked the gentleman,\nsurveying Dick’s attire.",
        "“Would you like to go to the same one?” asked Dick, shrewdly.",
        "“Well, no; it strikes me that he didn’t give you a very good fit.”",
        "“This coat once belonged to General Washington,” said Dick,\ncomically. “He wore it all through the Revolution, and it got torn\nsome, ’cause he fit so hard. When he died he told his widder to give\nit to some smart young feller that hadn’t got none of his own; so\nshe gave it to me. But if you’d like it, sir, to remember General\nWashington by, I’ll let you have it reasonable.”",
        "“Thank you, but I wouldn’t want to deprive you of it. And did your\npants come from General Washington too?”",
        "“No, they was a gift from Lewis Napoleon. Lewis had outgrown ’em\nand sent ’em to me,–he’s bigger than me, and that’s why they\ndon’t fit.”",
        "“It seems you have distinguished friends. Now, my lad, I suppose you\nwould like your money.”",
        "“I shouldn’t have any objection,” said Dick.",
        "“I believe,” said the gentleman, examining his pocket-book, “I\nhaven’t got anything short of twenty-five cents. Have you got\nany change?”",
        "“Not a cent,” said Dick. “All my money’s invested in the Erie\nRailroad.”",
        "“That’s unfortunate.”",
        "“Shall I get the money changed, sir?”",
        "“I can’t wait; I’ve got to meet an appointment immediately. I’ll\nhand you twenty-five cents, and you can leave the change at my\noffice any time during the day.”",
        "“All right, sir. Where is it?”",
        "“No. 125 Fulton Street. Shall you remember?”",
        "“Yes, sir. What name?”",
        "“Greyson,–office on second floor.”",
        "“All right, sir; I’ll bring it.”",
        "“I wonder whether the little scamp will prove honest,” said Mr.\nGreyson to himself, as he walked away. “If he does, I’ll give him\nmy custom regularly. If he don’t as is most likely, I shan’t mind\nthe loss of fifteen cents.”",
        "Mr. Greyson didn’t understand Dick. Our ragged hero wasn’t a model\nboy in all respects. I am afraid he swore sometimes, and now and\nthen he played tricks upon unsophisticated boys from the country,\nor gave a wrong direction to honest old gentlemen unused to the\ncity. A clergyman in search of the Cooper Institute he once directed\nto the Tombs Prison, and, following him unobserved, was highly\ndelighted when the unsuspicious stranger walked up the front steps\nof the great stone building on Centre Street, and tried to obtain\nadmission.",
        "“I guess he wouldn’t want to stay long if he did get in,” thought\nRagged Dick, hitching up his pants. “Leastways I shouldn’t. They’re\nso precious glad to see you that they won’t let you go, but board\nyou gratooitous, and never send in no bills.”",
        "Another of Dick’s faults was his extravagance. Being always\nwide-awake and ready for business, he earned enough to have\nsupported him comfortably and respectably. There were not a few\nyoung clerks who employed Dick from time to time in his professional\ncapacity, who scarcely earned as much as he, greatly as their style\nand dress exceeded his. But Dick was careless of his earnings. Where\nthey went he could hardly have told himself. However much he managed\nto earn during the day, all was generally spent before morning. He\nwas fond of going to the Old Bowery Theatre, and to Tony Pastor’s,\nand if he had any money left afterwards, he would invite some of\nhis friends in somewhere to have an oyster-stew; so it seldom\nhappened that he commenced the day with a penny.",
        "Then I am sorry to add that Dick had formed the habit of smoking.\nThis cost him considerable, for Dick was rather fastidious about his\ncigars, and wouldn’t smoke the cheapest. Besides, having a liberal\nnature, he was generally ready to treat his companions. But of\ncourse the expense was the smallest objection. No boy of fourteen\ncan smoke without being affected injuriously. Men are frequently\ninjured by smoking, and boys always. But large numbers of the\nnewsboys and boot-blacks form the habit. Exposed to the cold and wet\nthey find that it warms them up, and the self-indulgence grows upon\nthem. It is not uncommon to see a little boy, too young to be out\nof his mother’s sight, smoking with all the apparent satisfaction\nof a veteran smoker.",
        "There was another way in which Dick sometimes lost money. There was\na noted gambling-house on Baxter Street, which in the evening was\nsometimes crowded with these juvenile gamesters, who staked their\nhard earnings, generally losing of course, and refreshing themselves\nfrom time to time with a vile mixture of liquor at two cents a\nglass. Sometimes Dick strayed in here, and played with the rest.",
        "I have mentioned Dick’s faults and defects, because I want it\nunderstood, to begin with, that I don’t consider him a model boy.\nBut there were some good points about him nevertheless. He was above\ndoing anything mean or dishonorable. He would not steal, or cheat,\nor impose upon younger boys, but was frank and straight-forward,\nmanly and self-reliant. His nature was a noble one, and had saved\nhim from all mean faults. I hope my young readers will like him as\nI do, without being blind to his faults. Perhaps, although he was\nonly a boot-black, they may find something in him to imitate.",
        "And now, having fairly introduced Ragged Dick to my young readers,\nI must refer them to the next chapter for his further adventures.",
        "After Dick had finished polishing Mr. Greyson’s boots he was\nfortunate enough to secure three other customers, two of them\nreporters in the Tribune establishment, which occupies the corner\nof Spruce Street and Printing House Square.",
        "When Dick had got through with his last customer the City Hall clock\nindicated eight o’clock. He had been up an hour, and hard at work,\nand naturally began to think of breakfast. He went up to the head\nof Spruce Street, and turned into Nassau. Two blocks further, and he\nreached Ann Street. On this street was a small, cheap restaurant,\nwhere for five cents Dick could get a cup of coffee, and for ten\ncents more, a plate of beefsteak with a plate of bread thrown in.\nThese Dick ordered, and sat down at a table.",
        "It was a small apartment with a few plain tables unprovided with\ncloths, for the class of customers who patronized it were not very\nparticular. Our hero’s breakfast was soon before him. Neither the\ncoffee nor the steak were as good as can be bought at Delmonico’s;\nbut then it is very doubtful whether, in the present state of his\nwardrobe, Dick would have been received at that aristocratic\nrestaurant, even if his means had admitted of paying the high\nprices there charged.",
        "Dick had scarcely been served when he espied a boy about his own\nsize standing at the door, looking wistfully into the restaurant.\nThis was Johnny Nolan, a boy of fourteen, who was engaged in the\nsame profession as Ragged Dick. His wardrobe was in very much the\nsame condition as Dick’s.",
        "“Had your breakfast, Johnny?” inquired Dick, cutting off a piece of\nsteak.",
        "“No.”",
        "“Come in, then. Here’s room for you.”",
        "“I aint got no money,” said Johnny, looking a little enviously at\nhis more fortunate friend.",
        "“Haven’t you had any shines?”",
        "“Yes, I had one, but I shan’t get any pay till to-morrow.”",
        "“Are you hungry?”",
        "“Try me, and see.”",
        "“Come in. I’ll stand treat this morning.”",
        "Johnny Nolan was nowise slow to accept this invitation, and was soon\nseated beside Dick.",
        "“What’ll you have, Johnny?”",
        "“Same as you.”",
        "“Cup o’ coffee and beefsteak,” ordered Dick.",
        "These were promptly brought, and Johnny attacked them vigorously.",
        "Now, in the boot-blacking business, as well as in higher avocations,\nthe same rule prevails, that energy and industry are rewarded, and\nindolence suffers. Dick was energetic and on the alert for business,\nbut Johnny the reverse. The consequence was that Dick earned\nprobably three times as much as the other.",
        "“How do you like it?” asked Dick, surveying Johnny’s attacks upon\nthe steak with evident complacency.",
        "“It’s hunky.”",
        "I don’t believe “hunky” is to be found in either Webster’s or\nWorcester’s big dictionary; but boys will readily understand what\nit means.",
        "“Do you come here often?” asked Johnny.",
        "“Most every day. You’d better come too.”",
        "“I can’t afford it.”",
        "“Well, you’d ought to, then,” said Dick. “What do you do I’d\nlike to know?”",
        "“I don’t get near as much as you, Dick.”",
        "“Well you might if you tried. I keep my eyes open,–that’s the way\nI get jobs. You’re lazy, that’s what’s the matter.”",
        "Johnny did not see fit to reply to this charge. Probably he felt the\njustice of it, and preferred to proceed with the breakfast, which he\nenjoyed the more as it cost him nothing.",
        "Breakfast over, Dick walked up to the desk, and settled the bill.\nThen, followed by Johnny, he went out into the street.",
        "“Where are you going, Johnny?”",
        "“Up to Mr. Taylor’s, on Spruce Street, to see if he don’t want a\nshine.”",
        "“Do you work for him reg’lar?”",
        "“Yes. Him and his partner wants a shine most every day. Where are\nyou goin’?”",
        "“Down front of the Astor House. I guess I’ll find some customers\nthere.”",
        "At this moment Johnny started, and, dodging into an entry way, hid\nbehind the door, considerably to Dick’s surprise.",
        "“What’s the matter now?” asked our hero.",
        "“Has he gone?” asked Johnny, his voice betraying anxiety.",
        "“Who gone, I’d like to know?”",
        "“That man in the brown coat.”",
        "“What of him. You aint scared of him, are you?”",
        "“Yes, he got me a place once.”",
        "“Where?”",
        "“Ever so far off.”",
        "“What if he did?”",
        "“I ran away.”",
        "“Didn’t you like it?”",
        "“No, I had to get up too early. It was on a farm, and I had to get\nup at five to take care of the cows. I like New York best.”",
        "“Didn’t they give you enough to eat?”",
        "“Oh, yes, plenty.”",
        "“And you had a good bed?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Then you’d better have stayed. You don’t get either of them here.\nWhere’d you sleep last night?”",
        "“Up an alley in an old wagon.”",
        "“You had a better bed than that in the country, didn’t you?”",
        "“Yes, it was as soft as–as cotton.”",
        "Johnny had once slept on a bale of cotton, the recollection\nsupplying him with a comparison.",
        "“Why didn’t you stay?”",
        "“I felt lonely,” said Johnny.",
        "Johnny could not exactly explain his feelings, but it is often the\ncase that the young vagabond of the streets, though his food is\nuncertain, and his bed may be any old wagon or barrel that he is\nlucky enough to find unoccupied when night sets in, gets so attached\nto his precarious but independent mode of life, that he feels\ndiscontented in any other. He is accustomed to the noise and bustle\nand ever-varied life of the streets, and in the quiet scenes of the\ncountry misses the excitement in the midst of which he has always\ndwelt.",
        "Johnny had but one tie to bind him to the city. He had a father\nliving, but he might as well have been without one. Mr. Nolan was\na confirmed drunkard, and spent the greater part of his wages for\nliquor. His potations made him ugly, and inflamed a temper never\nvery sweet, working him up sometimes to such a pitch of rage that\nJohnny’s life was in danger. Some months before, he had thrown a\nflat-iron at his son’s head with such terrific force that unless\nJohnny had dodged he would not have lived long enough to obtain a\nplace in our story. He fled the house, and from that time had not\ndared to re-enter it. Somebody had given him a brush and box of\nblacking, and he had set up in business on his own account. But he\nhad not energy enough to succeed, as has already been stated, and\nI am afraid the poor boy had met with many hardships, and suffered\nmore than once from cold and hunger. Dick had befriended him more\nthan once, and often given him a breakfast or dinner, as the case\nmight be.",
        "“How’d you get away?” asked Dick, with some curiosity. “Did\nyou walk?”",
        "“No, I rode on the cars.”",
        "“Where’d you get your money? I hope you didn’t steal it.”",
        "“I didn’t have none.”",
        "“What did you do, then?”",
        "“I got up about three o’clock, and walked to Albany.”",
        "“Where’s that?” asked Dick, whose ideas on the subject of geography\nwere rather vague.",
        "“Up the river.”",
        "“How far?”",
        "“About a thousand miles,” said Johnny, whose conceptions of distance\nwere equally vague.",
        "“Go ahead. What did you do then?”",
        "“I hid on top of a freight car, and came all the way without their\nseeing me.* That man in the brown coat was the man that got me the\nplace, and I’m afraid he’d want to send me back.”",
        "* A fact.",
        "“Well,” said Dick, reflectively, “I dunno as I’d like to live in the\ncountry. I couldn’t go to Tony Pastor’s or the Old Bowery. There\nwouldn’t be no place to spend my evenings. But I say, it’s tough in\nwinter, Johnny, ’specially when your overcoat’s at the tailor’s, an’\nlikely to stay there.”",
        "“That’s so, Dick. But I must be goin’, or Mr. Taylor’ll get somebody\nelse to shine his boots.”",
        "Johnny walked back to Nassau Street, while Dick kept on his way to\nBroadway.",
        "“That boy,” soliloquized Dick, as Johnny took his departure, “aint\ngot no ambition. I’ll bet he won’t get five shines to-day. I’m glad\nI aint like him. I couldn’t go to the theatre, nor buy no cigars,\nnor get half as much as I wanted to eat.–Shine yer boots, sir?”",
        "Dick always had an eye to business, and this remark was addressed to\na young man, dressed in a stylish manner, who was swinging a jaunty\ncane.",
        "“I’ve had my boots blacked once already this morning, but this\nconfounded mud has spoiled the shine.”",
        "“I’ll make ’em all right, sir, in a minute.”",
        "“Go ahead, then.”",
        "The boots were soon polished in Dick’s best style, which proved very\nsatisfactory, our hero being a proficient in the art.",
        "“I haven’t got any change,” said the young man, fumbling in his\npocket, “but here’s a bill you may run somewhere and get changed.\nI’ll pay you five cents extra for your trouble.”",
        "He handed Dick a two-dollar bill, which our hero took into a store\nclose by.",
        "“Will you please change that, sir?” said Dick, walking up to the\ncounter.",
        "The salesman to whom he proffered it took the bill, and, slightly\nglancing at it, exclaimed angrily, “Be off, you young vagabond, or\nI’ll have you arrested.”",
        "“What’s the row?”",
        "“You’ve offered me a counterfeit bill.”",
        "“I didn’t know it,” said Dick.",
        "“Don’t tell me. Be off, or I’ll have you arrested.”",
        "Though Dick was somewhat startled at discovering that the bill he\nhad offered was counterfeit, he stood his ground bravely.",
        "“Clear out of this shop, you young vagabond,” repeated the clerk.",
        "“Then give me back my bill.”",
        "“That you may pass it again? No, sir, I shall do no such thing.”",
        "“It doesn’t belong to me,” said Dick. “A gentleman that owes me for\na shine gave it to me to change.”",
        "“A likely story,” said the clerk; but he seemed a little uneasy.",
        "“I’ll go and call him,” said Dick.",
        "He went out, and found his late customer standing on the Astor House\nsteps.",
        "“Well, youngster, have you brought back my change? You were a\nprecious long time about it. I began to think you had cleared out\nwith the money.”",
        "“That aint my style,” said Dick, proudly.",
        "“Then where’s the change?”",
        "“I haven’t got it.”",
        "“Where’s the bill then?”",
        "“I haven’t got that either.”",
        "“You young rascal!”",
        "“Hold on a minute, mister,” said Dick, “and I’ll tell you all about\nit. The man what took the bill said it wasn’t good, and kept it.”",
        "“The bill was perfectly good. So he kept it, did he? I’ll go with\nyou to the store, and see whether he won’t give it back to me.”",
        "Dick led the way, and the gentleman followed him into the store.\nAt the reappearance of Dick in such company, the clerk flushed a\nlittle, and looked nervous. He fancied that he could browbeat a\nragged boot-black, but with a gentleman he saw that it would be a\ndifferent matter. He did not seem to notice the newcomers, but\nbegan to replace some goods on the shelves.",
        "Now, said the young man, “point out the clerk that has my money.”",
        "“That’s him,” said Dick, pointing out the clerk.",
        "The gentleman walked up to the counter.",
        "“I will trouble you,” he said a little haughtily, “for a bill which\nthat boy offered you, and which you still hold in your possession.”",
        "“It was a bad bill,” said the clerk, his cheek flushing, and his\nmanner nervous.",
        "“It was no such thing. I require you to produce it, and let the\nmatter be decided.”",
        "The clerk fumbled in his vest-pocket, and drew out a bad-looking\nbill.",
        "“This is a bad bill, but it is not the one I gave the boy.”",
        "“It is the one he gave me.”",
        "The young man looked doubtful.",
        "“Boy,” he said to Dick, “is this the bill you gave to be changed?”",
        "“No, it isn’t.”",
        "“You lie, you young rascal!” exclaimed the clerk, who began to find\nhimself in a tight place, and could not see the way out.",
        "This scene naturally attracted the attention of all in the store,\nand the proprietor walked up from the lower end, where he had been\nbusy.",
        "“What’s all this, Mr. Hatch?” he demanded.",
        "“That boy,” said the clerk, “came in and asked change for a bad\nbill. I kept the bill, and told him to clear out. Now he wants it\nagain to pass on somebody else.”",
        "“Show the bill.”",
        "The merchant looked at it. “Yes, that’s a bad bill,” he said. “There\nis no doubt about that.”",
        "“But it is not the one the boy offered,” said Dick’s patron.\n\"It is one of the same denomination, but on a different bank.”",
        "“Do you remember what bank it was on?”",
        "“It was on the Merchants’ Bank of Boston.”",
        "“Are you sure of it?”",
        "“I am.”",
        "“Perhaps the boy kept it and offered the other.”",
        "“You may search me if you want to,” said Dick, indignantly.",
        "“He doesn’t look as if he was likely to have any extra bills. I\nsuspect that your clerk pocketed the good bill, and has substituted\nthe counterfeit note. It is a nice little scheme of his for making\nmoney.”",
        "“I haven’t seen any bill on the Merchants’ Bank,” said the clerk,\ndoggedly.",
        "“You had better feel in your pockets.”",
        "“This matter must be investigated,” said the merchant, firmly. “If\nyou have the bill, produce it.”",
        "“I haven’t got it,” said the clerk; but he looked guilty\nnotwithstanding.",
        "“I demand that he be searched,” said Dick’s patron.",
        "“I tell you I haven’t got it.”",
        "“Shall I send for a police officer, Mr. Hatch, or will you allow\nyourself to be searched quietly?” said the merchant.",
        "Alarmed at the threat implied in these words, the clerk put his hand\ninto his vest-pocket, and drew out a two-dollar bill on the\nMerchants’ Bank.",
        "“Is this your note?” asked the shopkeeper, showing it to the\nyoung man.",
        "“It is.”",
        "“I must have made a mistake,” faltered the clerk.",
        "“I shall not give you a chance to make such another mistake in my\nemploy,” said the merchant sternly. “You may go up to the desk and\nask for what wages are due you. I shall have no further occasion for\nyour services.”",
        "“Now, youngster,” said Dick’s patron, as they went out of the store,\nafter he had finally got the bill changed. “I must pay you something\nextra for your trouble. Here’s fifty cents.”",
        "“Thank you, sir,” said Dick. “You’re very kind. Don’t you want some\nmore bills changed?”",
        "“Not to-day,” said he with a smile. “It’s too expensive.”",
        "“I’m in luck,” thought our hero complacently. “I guess I’ll go to\nBarnum’s to-night, and see the bearded lady, the eight-foot giant,\nthe two-foot dwarf, and the other curiosities, too numerous to\nmention.”",
        "Dick shouldered his box and walked up as far as the Astor House. He\ntook his station on the sidewalk, and began to look about him.",
        "Just behind him were two persons,–one, a gentleman of fifty; the\nother, a boy of thirteen or fourteen. They were speaking together,\nand Dick had no difficulty in hearing what was said.",
        "“I am sorry, Frank, that I can’t go about, and show you some of the\nsights of New York, but I shall be full of business to-day. It is\nyour first visit to the city, too.”",
        "“Yes, sir.”",
        "“There’s a good deal worth seeing here. But I’m afraid you’ll have\nto wait to next time. You can go out and walk by yourself, but don’t\nventure too far, or you will get lost.”",
        "Frank looked disappointed.",
        "“I wish Tom Miles knew I was here,” he said. “He would go around\nwith me.”",
        "“Where does he live?”",
        "“Somewhere up town, I believe.”",
        "“Then, unfortunately, he is not available. If you would rather go\nwith me than stay here, you can, but as I shall be most of the time\nin merchants’-counting-rooms, I am afraid it would not be very\ninteresting.”",
        "“I think,” said Frank, after a little hesitation, “that I will go\noff by myself. I won’t go very far, and if I lose my way, I will\ninquire for the Astor House.”",
        "“Yes, anybody will direct you here. Very well, Frank, I am sorry I\ncan’t do better for you.”",
        "“Oh, never mind, uncle, I shall be amused in walking around, and\nlooking at the shop-windows. There will be a great deal to see.”",
        "Now Dick had listened to all this conversation. Being an\nenterprising young man, he thought he saw a chance for a\nspeculation, and determined to avail himself of it.",
        "Accordingly he stepped up to the two just as Frank’s uncle was about\nleaving, and said, “I know all about the city, sir; I’ll show him\naround, if you want me to.”",
        "The gentleman looked a little curiously at the ragged figure before\nhim.",
        "“So you are a city boy, are you?”",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Dick, “I’ve lived here ever since I was a baby.”",
        "“And you know all about the public buildings, I suppose?”",
        "“Yes, sir.”",
        "“And the Central Park?”",
        "“Yes, sir. I know my way all round.”",
        "The gentleman looked thoughtful.",
        "“I don’t know what to say, Frank,” he remarked after a while. “It is\nrather a novel proposal. He isn’t exactly the sort of guide I would\nhave picked out for you. Still he looks honest. He has an open face,\nand I think can be depended upon.”",
        "“I wish he wasn’t so ragged and dirty,” said Frank, who felt a\nlittle shy about being seen with such a companion.",
        "“I’m afraid you haven’t washed your face this morning,” said Mr.\nWhitney, for that was the gentleman’s name.",
        "“They didn’t have no wash-bowls at the hotel where I stopped,” said\nDick.",
        "“What hotel did you stop at?”",
        "“The Box Hotel.”",
        "“The Box Hotel?”",
        "“Yes, sir, I slept in a box on Spruce Street.”",
        "Frank surveyed Dick curiously.",
        "“How did you like it?” he asked.",
        "“I slept bully.”",
        "“Suppose it had rained.”",
        "“Then I’d have wet my best clothes,” said Dick.",
        "“Are these all the clothes you have?”",
        "“Yes, sir.”",
        "Mr. Whitney spoke a few words to Frank, who seemed pleased with the\nsuggestion.",
        "“Follow me, my lad,” he said.",
        "Dick in some surprise obeyed orders, following Mr. Whitney and Frank\ninto the hotel, past the office, to the foot of the staircase. Here\na servant of the hotel stopped Dick, but Mr. Whitney explained that\nhe had something for him to do, and he was allowed to proceed.",
        "They entered a long entry, and finally paused before a door. This\nbeing opened a pleasant chamber was disclosed.",
        "“Come in, my lad,” said Mr. Whitney.",
        "Dick and Frank entered.",
        "“Now,” said Mr. Whitney to Dick, “my nephew here is on his way to a\nboarding-school. He has a suit of clothes in his trunk about half\nworn. He is willing to give them to you. I think they will look\nbetter than those you have on.”",
        "Dick was so astonished that he hardly knew what to say. Presents\nwere something that he knew very little about, never having received\nany to his knowledge. That so large a gift should be made to him by\na stranger seemed very wonderful.",
        "The clothes were brought out, and turned out to be a neat gray suit.",
        "“Before you put them on, my lad, you must wash yourself. Clean\nclothes and a dirty skin don’t go very well together. Frank, you may\nattend to him. I am obliged to go at once. Have you got as much\nmoney as you require?”",
        "“Yes, uncle.”",
        "“One more word, my lad,” said Mr. Whitney, addressing Dick; “I may\nbe rash in trusting a boy of whom I know nothing, but I like your\nlooks, and I think you will prove a proper guide for my nephew.”",
        "“Yes, I will, sir,” said Dick, earnestly. “Honor bright!”",
        "“Very well. A pleasant time to you.”",
        "The process of cleansing commenced. To tell the truth Dick needed\nit, and the sensation of cleanliness he found both new and pleasant.\nFrank added to his gift a shirt, stockings, and an old pair of\nshoes. “I am sorry I haven’t any cap,” said he.",
        "“I’ve got one,” said Dick.",
        "“It isn’t so new as it might be,” said Frank, surveying an old felt\nhat, which had once been black, but was now dingy, with a large hole\nin the top and a portion of the rim torn off.",
        "“No,” said Dick; “my grandfather used to wear it when he was a boy,\nand I’ve kep’ it ever since out of respect for his memory. But I’ll\nget a new one now. I can buy one cheap on Chatham Street.”",
        "“Is that near here?”",
        "“Only five minutes’ walk.”",
        "“Then we can get one on the way.”",
        "When Dick was dressed in his new attire, with his face and hands\nclean, and his hair brushed, it was difficult to imagine that he was\nthe same boy.",
        "He now looked quite handsome, and might readily have been taken for\na young gentleman, except that his hands were red and grimy.",
        "“Look at yourself,” said Frank, leading him before the mirror.",
        "“By gracious!” said Dick, starting back in astonishment, “that isn’t\nme, is it?”",
        "“Don’t you know yourself?” asked Frank, smiling.",
        "“It reminds me of Cinderella,” said Dick, “when she was changed into\na fairy princess. I see it one night at Barnum’s. What’ll Johnny\nNolan say when he sees me? He won’t dare to speak to such a young\nswell as I be now. Aint it rich?” and Dick burst into a loud laugh.\nHis fancy was tickled by the anticipation of his friend’s surprise.\nThen the thought of the valuable gifts he had revived occurred to\nhim, and he looked gratefully at Frank.",
        "“You’re a brick,” he said.",
        "“A what?”",
        "“A brick! You’re a jolly good fellow to give me such a present.”",
        "“You’re quite welcome, Dick,” said Frank, kindly. “I’m better off\nthan you are, and I can spare the clothes just as well as not. You\nmust have a new hat though. But that we can get when we go out. The\nold clothes you can make into a bundle.”",
        "“Wait a minute till I get my handkercher,” and Dick pulled from the\npocket of the pants a dirty rag, which might have been white once,\nthough it did not look like it, and had apparently once formed a\npart of a sheet or shirt.",
        "“You mustn’t carry that,” said Frank.",
        "“But I’ve got a cold,” said Dick.",
        "“Oh, I don’t mean you to go without a handkerchief. I’ll give you\none.”",
        "Frank opened his trunk and pulled out two, which he gave to Dick.",
        "“I wonder if I aint dreamin’,” said Dick, once more surveying\nhimself doubtfully in the glass. “I’m afraid I’m dreamin’, and shall\nwake up in a barrel, as I did night afore last.”",
        "“Shall I pinch you so you can wake here?” asked Frank, playfully.",
        "“Yes,” said Dick, seriously, “I wish you would.”",
        "He pulled up the sleeve of his jacket, and Frank pinched him pretty\nhard, so that Dick winced.",
        "“Yes, I guess I’m awake,” said Dick; “you’ve got a pair of nippers,\nyou have. But what shall I do with my brush and blacking?” he asked.",
        "“You can leave them here till we come back,” said Frank. “They will\nbe safe.”",
        "“Hold on a minute,” said Dick, surveying Frank’s boots with a\nprofessional eye, “you aint got a good shine on them boots. I’ll\nmake ’em shine so you can see your face in ’em.”",
        "And he was as good as his word.",
        "“Thank you,” said Frank; “now you had better brush your own shoes.”",
        "This had not occurred to Dick, for in general the professional\nboot-black considers his blacking too valuable to expend on his\nown shoes or boots, if he is fortunate enough to possess a pair.",
        "The two boys now went downstairs together. They met the same servant\nwho had spoken to Dick a few minutes before, but there was no\nrecognition.",
        "“He don’t know me,” said Dick. “He thinks I’m a young swell like\nyou.”",
        "“What’s a swell?”",
        "“Oh, a feller that wears nobby clothes like you.”",
        "“And you, too, Dick.”",
        "“Yes,” said Dick, “who’d ever have thought as I should have turned\ninto a swell?”",
        "They had now got out on Broadway, and were slowly walking along the\nwest side by the Park, when who should Dick see in front of him, but\nJohnny Nolan?",
        "Instantly Dick was seized with a fancy for witnessing Johnny’s\namazement at his change in appearance. He stole up behind him, and\nstruck him on the back.",
        "“Hallo, Johnny, how many shines have you had?”",
        "Johnny turned round expecting to see Dick, whose voice he\nrecognized, but his astonished eyes rested on a nicely dressed\nboy (the hat alone excepted) who looked indeed like Dick, but\nso transformed in dress that it was difficult to be sure of\nhis identity.",
        "“What luck, Johnny?” repeated Dick.",
        "Johnny surveyed him from head to foot in great bewilderment.",
        "“Who be you?” he said.",
        "“Well, that’s a good one,” laughed Dick; “so you don’t know Dick?”",
        "“Where’d you get all them clothes?” asked Johnny. “Have you been\nstealin’?”",
        "“Say that again, and I’ll lick you. No, I’ve lent my clothes to a\nyoung feller as was goin’ to a party, and didn’t have none fit to\nwear, and so I put on my second-best for a change.”",
        "Without deigning any further explanation, Dick went off, followed\nby the astonished gaze of Johnny Nolan, who could not quite make up\nhis mind whether the neat-looking boy he had been talking with was\nreally Ragged Dick or not.",
        "In order to reach Chatham Street it was necessary to cross Broadway.\nThis was easier proposed than done. There is always such a throng\nof omnibuses, drays, carriages, and vehicles of all kinds in the\nneighborhood of the Astor House, that the crossing is formidable\nto one who is not used to it. Dick made nothing of it, dodging in\nand out among the horses and wagons with perfect self-possession.\nReaching the opposite sidewalk, he looked back, and found that\nFrank had retreated in dismay, and that the width of the street\nwas between them.",
        "“Come across!” called out Dick.",
        "“I don’t see any chance,” said Frank, looking anxiously at the\nprospect before him. “I’m afraid of being run over.”",
        "“If you are, you can sue ’em for damages,” said Dick.",
        "Finally Frank got safely over after several narrow escapes, as he\nconsidered them.",
        "“Is it always so crowded?” he asked.",
        "“A good deal worse sometimes,” said Dick. “I knowed a young man once\nwho waited six hours for a chance to cross, and at last got run\nover by an omnibus, leaving a widder and a large family of orphan\nchildren. His widder, a beautiful young woman, was obliged to start\na peanut and apple stand. There she is now.”",
        "“Where?”",
        "Dick pointed to a hideous old woman, of large proportions, wearing a\nbonnet of immense size, who presided over an apple-stand close by.",
        "Frank laughed.",
        "“If that is the case,” he said, “I think I will patronize her.”",
        "“Leave it to me,” said Dick, winking.",
        "He advanced gravely to the apple-stand, and said, “Old lady,\nhave you paid your taxes?”",
        "The astonished woman opened her eyes.",
        "“I’m a gov’ment officer,” said Dick, “sent by the mayor to collect\nyour taxes. I’ll take it in apples just to oblige. That big red one\nwill about pay what you’re owin’ to the gov’ment.”",
        "“I don’t know nothing about no taxes,” said the old woman, in\nbewilderment.",
        "“Then,” said Dick, “I’ll let you off this time. Give us two of\nyour best apples, and my friend here, the President of the Common\nCouncil, will pay you.”",
        "Frank smiling, paid three cents apiece for the apples, and they\nsauntered on, Dick remarking, “If these apples aint good, old lady,\nwe’ll return ’em, and get our money back.” This would have been\nrather difficult in his case, as the apple was already half\nconsumed.",
        "Chatham Street, where they wished to go, being on the East side, the\ntwo boys crossed the Park. This is an enclosure of about ten acres,\nwhich years ago was covered with a green sward, but is now a great\nthoroughfare for pedestrians and contains several important public\nbuildings. Dick pointed out the City Hall, the Hall of Records, and\nthe Rotunda. The former is a white building of large size, and\nsurmounted by a cupola.",
        "“That’s where the mayor’s office is,” said Dick. “Him and me\nare very good friends. I once blacked his boots by partic’lar\nappointment. That’s the way I pay my city taxes.”",
        "They were soon in Chatham Street, walking between rows of ready-made\nclothing shops, many of which had half their stock in trade exposed\non the sidewalk. The proprietors of these establishments stood at\nthe doors, watching attentively the passersby, extending urgent\ninvitations to any who even glanced at the goods to enter.",
        "“Walk in, young gentlemen,” said a stout man, at the entrance of one\nshop.",
        "“No, I thank you,” replied Dick, “as the fly said to the spider.”",
        "“We’re selling off at less than cost.”",
        "“Of course you be. That’s where you makes your money,” said Dick.\n\"There aint nobody of any enterprise that pretends to make any\nprofit on his goods.”",
        "The Chatham Street trader looked after our hero as if he didn’t\nquite comprehend him; but Dick, without waiting for a reply, passed\non with his companion.",
        "In some of the shops auctions seemed to be going on.",
        "“I am only offered two dollars, gentlemen, for this elegant pair\nof doeskin pants, made of the very best of cloth. It’s a frightful\nsacrifice. Who’ll give an eighth? Thank you, sir. Only seventeen\nshillings! Why the cloth cost more by the yard!”",
        "This speaker was standing on a little platform haranguing to three\nmen, holding in his hand meanwhile a pair of pants very loose in\nthe legs, and presenting a cheap Bowery look.",
        "Frank and Dick paused before the shop door, and finally saw them\nknocked down to rather a verdant-looking individual at three\ndollars.",
        "“Clothes seem to be pretty cheap here,” said Frank.",
        "“Yes, but Baxter Street is the cheapest place.”",
        "“Is it?”",
        "“Yes. Johnny Nolan got a whole rig-out there last week, for a\ndollar,–coat, cap, vest, pants, and shoes. They was very good\nmeasure, too, like my best clothes that I took off to oblige you.”",
        "“I shall know where to come for clothes next time,” said Frank,\nlaughing. “I had no idea the city was so much cheaper than the\ncountry. I suppose the Baxter Street tailors are fashionable?”",
        "“In course they are. Me and Horace Greeley always go there for\nclothes. When Horace gets a new suit, I always have one made just\nlike it; but I can’t go the white hat. It aint becomin’ to my\nstyle of beauty.”",
        "A little farther on a man was standing out on the sidewalk,\ndistributing small printed handbills. One was handed to Frank,\nwhich he read as follows,–",
        "“GRAND CLOSING-OUT SALE!–A variety of Beautiful and Costly\nArticles for Sale, at a Dollar apiece. Unparalleled Inducements!\nWalk in, Gentlemen!”",
        "“Whereabouts is this sale?” asked Frank.",
        "“In here, young gentlemen,” said a black-whiskered individual,\nwho appeared suddenly on the scene. “Walk in.”",
        "“Shall we go in, Dick?”",
        "“It’s a swindlin’ shop,” said Dick, in a low voice. “I’ve been\nthere. That man’s a regular cheat. He’s seen me before, but he\ndon’t know me coz of my clothes.”",
        "“Step in and see the articles,” said the man, persuasively. “You\nneedn’t buy, you know.”",
        "“Are all the articles worth more’n a dollar?” asked Dick.",
        "“Yes,” said the other, “and some worth a great deal more.”",
        "“Such as what?”",
        "“Well, there’s a silver pitcher worth twenty dollars.”",
        "“And you sell it for a dollar. That’s very kind of you,” said Dick,\ninnocently.",
        "“Walk in, and you’ll understand it.”",
        "“No, I guess not,” said Dick. “My servants is so dishonest that I\nwouldn’t like to trust ’em with a silver pitcher. Come along, Frank.\nI hope you’ll succeed in your charitable enterprise of supplyin’\nthe public with silver pitchers at nineteen dollars less than they\nare worth.”",
        "“How does he manage, Dick?” asked Frank, as they went on.",
        "“All his articles are numbered, and he makes you pay a dollar, and\nthen shakes some dice, and whatever the figgers come to, is the\nnumber of the article you draw. Most of ’em aint worth sixpence.”",
        "A hat and cap store being close at hand, Dick and Frank went in. For\nseventy-five cents, which Frank insisted on paying, Dick succeeded\nin getting quite a neat-looking cap, which corresponded much better\nwith his appearance than the one he had on. The last, not being\nconsidered worth keeping, Dick dropped on the sidewalk, from which,\non looking back, he saw it picked up by a brother boot-black who\nappeared to consider it better than his own.",
        "They retraced their steps and went up Chambers Street to Broadway.\nAt the corner of Broadway and Chambers Street is a large white\nmarble warehouse, which attracted Frank’s attention.",
        "“What building is that?” he asked, with interest.",
        "“That belongs to my friend A. T. Stewart,” said Dick. “It’s the\nbiggest store on Broadway.* If I ever retire from boot-blackin’, and\ngo into mercantile pursuits, I may buy him out, or build another\nstore that’ll take the shine off this one.”",
        "* Mr. Stewart’s Tenth Street store was not open at the time\nDick spoke.",
        "“Were you ever in the store?” asked Frank.",
        "“No,” said Dick; “but I’m intimate with one of Stewart’s partners.\nHe is a cash boy, and does nothing but take money all day.”",
        "“A very agreeable employment,” said Frank, laughing.",
        "“Yes,” said Dick, “I’d like to be in it.”",
        "The boys crossed to the West side of Broadway, and walked slowly up\nthe street. To Frank it was a very interesting spectacle. Accustomed\nto the quiet of the country, there was something fascinating in the\ncrowds of people thronging the sidewalks, and the great variety of\nvehicles constantly passing and repassing in the street. Then again\nthe shop-windows with their multifarious contents interested and\namused him, and he was constantly checking Dick to look in at some\nwell-stocked window.",
        "“I don’t see how so many shopkeepers can find people enough to buy\nof them,” he said. “We haven’t got but two stores in our village,\nand Broadway seems to be full of them.”",
        "“Yes,” said Dick; “and its pretty much the same in the avenoos,\n’specially the Third, Sixth, and Eighth avenoos. The Bowery, too,\nis a great place for shoppin’. There everybody sells cheaper’n\nanybody else, and nobody pretends to make no profit on their goods.”",
        "“Where’s Barnum’s Museum?” asked Frank.",
        "“Oh, that’s down nearly opposite the Astor House,” said Dick.\n\"Didn’t you see a great building with lots of flags?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Well, that’s Barnum’s.* That’s where the Happy Family live, and the\nlions, and bears, and curiosities generally. It’s a tip-top place.\nHaven’t you ever been there? It’s most as good as the Old Bowery,\nonly the plays isn’t quite so excitin’.”",
        "* Since destroyed by fire, and rebuilt farther up Broadway,\nand again burned down in February.",
        "“I’ll go if I get time,” said Frank. “There is a boy at home who\ncame to New York a month ago, and went to Barnum’s, and has been\ntalking about it ever since, so I suppose it must be worth seeing.”",
        "“They’ve got a great play at the Old Bowery now,” pursued Dick.\n\"’Tis called the ’Demon of the Danube.’ The Demon falls in love with\na young woman, and drags her by the hair up to the top of a steep\nrock where his castle stands.”",
        "“That’s a queer way of showing his love,” said Frank, laughing.",
        "“She didn’t want to go with him, you know, but was in love with\nanother chap. When he heard about his girl bein’ carried off, he\nfelt awful, and swore an oath not to rest till he had got her free.\nWell, at last he got into the castle by some underground passage,\nand he and the Demon had a fight. Oh, it was bully seein’ ’em roll\nround on the stage, cuttin’ and slashin’ at each other.”",
        "“And which got the best of it?”",
        "“At first the Demon seemed to be ahead, but at last the young Baron\ngot him down, and struck a dagger into his heart, sayin’, ’Die,\nfalse and perjured villain! The dogs shall feast upon thy carcass!’\nand then the Demon give an awful howl and died. Then the Baron\nseized his body, and threw it over the precipice.”",
        "“It seems to me the actor who plays the Demon ought to get extra\npay, if he has to be treated that way.”",
        "“That’s so,” said Dick; “but I guess he’s used to it. It seems to\nagree with his constitution.”",
        "“What building is that?” asked Frank, pointing to a structure\nseveral rods back from the street, with a large yard in front. It\nwas an unusual sight for Broadway, all the other buildings in that\nneighborhood being even with the street.",
        "“That is the New York Hospital,” said Dick. “They’re a rich\ninstitution, and take care of sick people on very reasonable terms.”",
        "“Did you ever go in there?”",
        "“Yes,” said Dick; “there was a friend of mine, Johnny Mullen, he was\na newsboy, got run over by a omnibus as he was crossin’ Broadway\ndown near Park Place. He was carried to the Hospital, and me and\nsome of his friends paid his board while he was there. It was only\nthree dollars a week, which was very cheap, considerin’ all the care\nthey took of him. I got leave to come and see him while he was here.\nEverything looked so nice and comfortable, that I thought a little\nof coaxin’ a omnibus driver to run over me, so I might go there\ntoo.”",
        "“Did your friend have to have his leg cut off?” asked Frank,\ninterested.",
        "“No,” said Dick; “though there was a young student there that was\nvery anxious to have it cut off; but it wasn’t done, and Johnny is\naround the streets as well as ever.”",
        "While this conversation was going on they reached No. 365, at the\ncorner of Franklin Street.*",
        "* Now the office of the Merchants’ Union Express Company.",
        "“That’s Taylor’s Saloon,” said Dick. “When I come into a fortun’ I\nshall take my meals there reg’lar.”",
        "“I have heard of it very often,” said Frank. “It is said to be very\nelegant. Suppose we go in and take an ice-cream. It will give us a\nchance to see it to better advantage.”",
        "“Thank you,” said Dick; “I think that’s the most agreeable way of\nseein’ the place myself.”",
        "The boys entered, and found themselves in a spacious and elegant\nsaloon, resplendent with gilding, and adorned on all sides by costly\nmirrors. They sat down to a small table with a marble top, and Frank\ngave the order.",
        "“It reminds me of Aladdin’s palace,” said Frank, looking about him.",
        "“Does it?” said Dick; “he must have had plenty of money.”",
        "“He had an old lamp, which he had only to rub, when the Slave of the\nLamp would appear, and do whatever he wanted.”",
        "“That must have been a valooable lamp. I’d be willin’ to give all my\nErie shares for it.”",
        "There was a tall, gaunt individual at the next table, who apparently\nheard this last remark of Dick’s. Turning towards our hero, he said,\n\"May I inquire, young man, whether you are largely interested in\nthis Erie Railroad?”",
        "“I haven’t got no property except what’s invested in Erie,” said\nDick, with a comical side-glance at Frank.",
        "“Indeed! I suppose the investment was made by your guardian.”",
        "“No,” said Dick; “I manage my property myself.”",
        "“And I presume your dividends have not been large?”",
        "“Why, no,” said Dick; “you’re about right there. They haven’t.”",
        "“As I supposed. It’s poor stock. Now, my young friend, I can\nrecommend a much better investment, which will yield you a large\nannual income. I am agent of the Excelsior Copper Mining Company,\nwhich possesses one of the most productive mines in the world. It’s\nsure to yield fifty per cent. on the investment. Now, all you have\nto do is to sell out your Erie shares, and invest in our stock, and\nI’ll insure you a fortune in three years. How many shares did you\nsay you had?”",
        "“I didn’t say, that I remember,” said Dick. “Your offer is very kind\nand obligin’, and as soon as I get time I’ll see about it.”",
        "“I hope you will,” said the stranger. “Permit me to give you my\ncard. ’Samuel Snap, No. – Wall Street.’ I shall be most happy to\nreceive a call from you, and exhibit the maps of our mine. I should\nbe glad to have you mention the matter also to your friends. I am\nconfident you could do no greater service than to induce them to\nembark in our enterprise.”",
        "“Very good,” said Dick.",
        "Here the stranger left the table, and walked up to the desk to\nsettle his bill.",
        "“You see what it is to be a man of fortun’, Frank,” said Dick, “and\nwear good clothes. I wonder what that chap’ll say when he sees me\nblackin’ boots to-morrow in the street?”",
        "“Perhaps you earn your money more honorably than he does, after\nall,” said Frank. “Some of these mining companies are nothing but\nswindles, got up to cheat people out of their money.”",
        "“He’s welcome to all he gets out of me,” said Dick.",
        "As the boys pursued their way up Broadway, Dick pointed out the\nprominent hotels and places of amusement. Frank was particularly\nstruck with the imposing fronts of the St. Nicholas and Metropolitan\nHotels, the former of white marble, the latter of a subdued brown\nhue, but not less elegant in its internal appointments. He was not\nsurprised to be informed that each of these splendid structures cost\nwith the furnishing not far from a million dollars.",
        "At Eighth Street Dick turned to the right, and pointed out the\nClinton Hall Building now occupied by the Mercantile Library,\ncomprising at that time over fifty thousand volumes.*",
        "* Now not far from one hundred thousand.",
        "A little farther on they came to a large building standing by itself\njust at the opening of Third and Fourth Avenues, and with one side\non each.",
        "“What is that building?” asked Frank.",
        "“That’s the Cooper Institute,” said Dick; “built by Mr. Cooper,\na particular friend of mine. Me and Peter Cooper used to go to\nschool together.”",
        "“What is there inside?” asked Frank.",
        "“There’s a hall for public meetin’s and lectures in the basement,\nand a readin’ room and a picture gallery up above,” said Dick.",
        "Directly opposite Cooper Institute, Frank saw a very large building\nof brick, covering about an acre of ground.",
        "“Is that a hotel?” he asked.",
        "“No,” said Dick; “that’s the Bible House. It’s the place where they\nmake Bibles. I was in there once,–saw a big pile of ’em.”",
        "“Did you ever read the Bible?” asked Frank, who had some idea of the\nneglected state of Dick’s education.",
        "“No,” said Dick; “I’ve heard it’s a good book, but I never read one.\nI aint much on readin’. It makes my head ache.”",
        "“I suppose you can’t read very fast.”",
        "“I can read the little words pretty well, but the big ones is what\nstick me.”",
        "“If I lived in the city, you might come every evening to me, and I\nwould teach you.”",
        "“Would you take so much trouble about me?” asked Dick, earnestly.",
        "“Certainly; I should like to see you getting on. There isn’t much\nchance of that if you don’t know how to read and write.”",
        "“You’re a good feller,” said Dick, gratefully. “I wish you did live\nin New York. I’d like to know somethin’. Whereabouts do you live?”",
        "“About fifty miles off, in a town on the left bank of the Hudson.\nI wish you’d come up and see me sometime. I would like to have you\ncome and stop two or three days.”",
        "“Honor bright?”",
        "“I don’t understand.”",
        "“Do you mean it?” asked Dick, incredulously.",
        "“Of course I do. Why shouldn’t I?”",
        "“What would your folks say if they knowed you asked a boot-black to\nvisit you?”",
        "“You are none the worse for being a boot-black, Dick.”",
        "“I aint used to genteel society,” said Dick. “I shouldn’t know how\nto behave.”",
        "“Then I could show you. You won’t be a boot-black all your life, you\nknow.”",
        "“No,” said Dick; “I’m goin’ to knock off when I get to be ninety.”",
        "“Before that, I hope,” said Frank, smiling.",
        "“I really wish I could get somethin’ else to do,” said Dick,\nsoberly. “I’d like to be a office boy, and learn business, and grow\nup ’spectable.”",
        "“Why don’t you try, and see if you can’t get a place, Dick?”",
        "“Who’d take Ragged Dick?”",
        "“But you aint ragged now, Dick.”",
        "“No,” said Dick; “I look a little better than I did in my Washington\ncoat and Louis Napoleon pants. But if I got in a office, they\nwouldn’t give me more’n three dollars a week, and I couldn’t live\n’spectable on that.”",
        "“No, I suppose not,” said Frank, thoughtfully. “But you would get\nmore at the end of the first year.”",
        "“Yes,” said Dick; “but by that time I’d be nothin’ but skin and\nbones.”",
        "Frank laughed. “That reminds me,” he said, “of the story of an\nIrishman, who, out of economy, thought he would teach his horse to\nfeed on shavings. So he provided the horse with a pair of green\nspectacles which made the shavings look eatable. But unfortunately,\njust as the horse got learned, he up and died.”",
        "“The hoss must have been a fine specimen of architectur’ by the time\nhe got through,” remarked Dick.",
        "“Whereabouts are we now?” asked Frank, as they emerged from Fourth\nAvenue into Union Square.",
        "“That is Union Park,” said Dick, pointing to a beautiful enclosure,\nin the centre of which was a pond, with a fountain playing.",
        "“Is that the statue of General Washington?” asked Frank, pointing to\na bronze equestrian statue, on a granite pedestal.",
        "“Yes,” said Dick; “he’s growed some since he was President. If\nhe’d been as tall as that when he fit in the Revolution, he’d have\nwalloped the Britishers some, I reckon.”",
        "Frank looked up at the statue, which is fourteen and a half feet\nhigh, and acknowledged the justice of Dick’s remark.",
        "“How about the coat, Dick?” he asked. “Would it fit you?”",
        "“Well, it might be rather loose,” said Dick, “I aint much more’n\nten feet high with my boots off.”",
        "“No, I should think not,” said Frank, smiling. “You’re a queer boy,\nDick.”",
        "“Well, I’ve been brought up queer. Some boys is born with a silver\nspoon in their mouth. Victoria’s boys is born with a gold spoon, set\nwith di’monds; but gold and silver was scarce when I was born, and\nmine was pewter.”",
        "“Perhaps the gold and silver will come by and by, Dick. Did you ever\nhear of Dick Whittington?”",
        "“Never did. Was he a Ragged Dick?”",
        "“I shouldn’t wonder if he was. At any rate he was very poor when he\nwas a boy, but he didn’t stay so. Before he died, he became Lord\nMayor of London.”",
        "“Did he?” asked Dick, looking interested. “How did he do it?”",
        "“Why, you see, a rich merchant took pity on him, and gave him a\nhome in his own house, where he used to stay with the servants,\nbeing employed in little errands. One day the merchant noticed Dick\npicking up pins and needles that had been dropped, and asked him\nwhy he did it. Dick told him he was going to sell them when he got\nenough. The merchant was pleased with his saving disposition, and\nwhen soon after, he was going to send a vessel to foreign parts, he\ntold Dick he might send anything he pleased in it, and it should\nbe sold to his advantage. Now Dick had nothing in the world but a\nkitten which had been given him a short time before.”",
        "“How much taxes did he have to pay on it?” asked Dick.",
        "“Not very high, probably. But having only the kitten, he concluded\nto send it along. After sailing a good many months, during which the\nkitten grew up to be a strong cat, the ship touched at an island\nnever before known, which happened to be infested with rats and\nmice to such an extent that they worried everybody’s life out, and\neven ransacked the king’s palace. To make a long story short, the\ncaptain, seeing how matters stood, brought Dick’s cat ashore,\nand she soon made the rats and mice scatter. The king was highly\ndelighted when he saw what havoc she made among the rats and mice,\nand resolved to have her at any price. So he offered a great\nquantity of gold for her, which, of course, the captain was glad\nto accept. It was faithfully carried back to Dick, and laid the\nfoundation of his fortune. He prospered as he grew up, and in time\nbecame a very rich merchant, respected by all, and before he died\nwas elected Lord Mayor of London.”",
        "“That’s a pretty good story” said Dick; “but I don’t believe all the\ncats in New York will ever make me mayor.”",
        "“No, probably not, but you may rise in some other way. A good many\ndistinguished men have once been poor boys. There’s hope for you,\nDick, if you’ll try.”",
        "“Nobody ever talked to me so before,” said Dick. “They just called\nme Ragged Dick, and told me I’d grow up to be a vagabone (boys who\nare better educated need not be surprised at Dick’s blunders) and\ncome to the gallows.”",
        "“Telling you so won’t make it turn out so, Dick. If you’ll try to\nbe somebody, and grow up into a respectable member of society, you\nwill. You may not become rich,–it isn’t everybody that becomes\nrich, you know–but you can obtain a good position, and be\nrespected.”",
        "“I’ll try,” said Dick, earnestly. “I needn’t have been Ragged Dick\nso long if I hadn’t spent my money in goin’ to the theatre, and\ntreatin’ boys to oyster-stews, and bettin’ money on cards, and\nsuch like.”",
        "“Have you lost money that way?”",
        "“Lots of it. One time I saved up five dollars to buy me a new\nrig-out, cos my best suit was all in rags, when Limpy Jim wanted\nme to play a game with him.”",
        "“Limpy Jim?” said Frank, interrogatively.",
        "“Yes, he’s lame; that’s what makes us call him Limpy Jim.”",
        "“I suppose you lost?”",
        "“Yes, I lost every penny, and had to sleep out, cos I hadn’t a cent\nto pay for lodgin’. ’Twas a awful cold night, and I got most froze.”",
        "“Wouldn’t Jim let you have any of the money he had won to pay for a\nlodging?”",
        "“No; I axed him for five cents, but he wouldn’t let me have it.”",
        "“Can you get lodging for five cents?” asked Frank, in surprise.",
        "“Yes,” said Dick, “but not at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. That’s it\nright out there.”",
        "They had reached the junction of Broadway and of Fifth Avenue.\nBefore them was a beautiful park of ten acres. On the left-hand side\nwas a large marble building, presenting a fine appearance with its\nextensive white front. This was the building at which Dick pointed.",
        "“Is that the Fifth Avenue Hotel?” asked Frank. “I’ve heard of it\noften. My Uncle William always stops there when he comes to New\nYork.”",
        "“I once slept on the outside of it,” said Dick. “They was very\nreasonable in their charges, and told me I might come again.”",
        "“Perhaps sometime you’ll be able to sleep inside,” said Frank.",
        "“I guess that’ll be when Queen Victoria goes to the Five Points\nto live.”",
        "“It looks like a palace,” said Frank. “The queen needn’t be ashamed\nto live in such a beautiful building as that.”",
        "Though Frank did not know it, one of the queen’s palaces is far\nfrom being as fine a looking building as the Fifth Avenue Hotel.\nSt. James’ Palace is a very ugly-looking brick structure, and\nappears much more like a factory than like the home of royalty.\nThere are few hotels in the world as fine-looking as this\ndemocratic institution.",
        "At that moment a gentleman passed them on the sidewalk, who looked\nback at Dick, as if his face seemed familiar.",
        "“I know that man,” said Dick, after he had passed. “He’s one of my\ncustomers.”",
        "“What is his name?”",
        "“I don’t know.”",
        "“He looked back as if he thought he knew you.”",
        "“He would have knowed me at once if it hadn’t been for my new\nclothes,” said Dick. “I don’t look much like Ragged Dick now.”",
        "“I suppose your face looked familiar.”",
        "“All but the dirt,” said Dick, laughing. “I don’t always have the\nchance of washing my face and hands in the Astor House.”",
        "“You told me,” said Frank, “that there was a place where you could\nget lodging for five cents. Where’s that?”",
        "“It’s the News-boys’ Lodgin’ House, on Fulton Street,” said Dick,\n\"up over the ’Sun’ office. It’s a good place. I don’t know what us\nboys would do without it. They give you supper for six cents, and\na bed for five cents more.”",
        "“I suppose some boys don’t even have the five cents to pay,–do\nthey?”",
        "“They’ll trust the boys,” said Dick. “But I don’t like to get\ntrusted. I’d be ashamed to get trusted for five cents, or ten\neither. One night I was comin’ down Chatham Street, with fifty\ncents in my pocket. I was goin’ to get a good oyster-stew, and then\ngo to the lodgin’ house; but somehow it slipped through a hole in\nmy trowses-pocket, and I hadn’t a cent left. If it had been summer\nI shouldn’t have cared, but it’s rather tough stayin’ out winter\nnights.”",
        "Frank, who had always possessed a good home of his own, found\nit hard to realize that the boy who was walking at his side had\nactually walked the streets in the cold without a home, or money\nto procure the common comfort of a bed.",
        "“What did you do?” he asked, his voice full of sympathy.",
        "“I went to the ’Times’ office. I knowed one of the pressmen, and he\nlet me set down in a corner, where I was warm, and I soon got fast\nasleep.”",
        "“Why don’t you get a room somewhere, and so always have a home to\ngo to?”",
        "“I dunno,” said Dick. “I never thought of it. P’rhaps I may hire a\nfurnished house on Madison Square.”",
        "“That’s where Flora McFlimsey lived.”",
        "“I don’t know her,” said Dick, who had never read the popular poem\nof which she is the heroine.",
        "While this conversation was going on, they had turned into\nTwenty-fifth Street, and had by this time reached Third Avenue.",
        "Just before entering it, their attention was drawn to the rather\nsingular conduct of an individual in front of them. Stopping\nsuddenly, he appeared to pick up something from the sidewalk,\nand then looked about him in rather a confused way.",
        "“I know his game,” whispered Dick. “Come along and you’ll see what\nit is.”",
        "He hurried Frank forward until they overtook the man, who had come\nto a stand-still.",
        "“Have you found anything?” asked Dick.",
        "“Yes,” said the man, “I’ve found this.”",
        "He exhibited a wallet which seemed stuffed with bills, to judge from\nits plethoric appearance.",
        "“Whew!” exclaimed Dick; “you’re in luck.”",
        "“I suppose somebody has lost it,” said the man, “and will offer a\nhandsome reward.”",
        "“Which you’ll get.”",
        "“Unfortunately I am obliged to take the next train to Boston. That’s\nwhere I live. I haven’t time to hunt up the owner.”",
        "“Then I suppose you’ll take the pocket-book with you,” said Dick,\nwith assumed simplicity.",
        "“I should like to leave it with some honest fellow who would see it\nreturned to the owner,” said the man, glancing at the boys.",
        "“I’m honest,” said Dick.",
        "“I’ve no doubt of it,” said the other. “Well, young man, I’ll make\nyou an offer. You take the pocket-book–”",
        "“All right. Hand it over, then.”",
        "“Wait a minute. There must be a large sum inside. I shouldn’t wonder\nif there might be a thousand dollars. The owner will probably give\nyou a hundred dollars reward.”",
        "“Why don’t you stay and get it?” asked Frank.",
        "“I would, only there is sickness in my family, and I must get home\nas soon as possible. Just give me twenty dollars, and I’ll hand you\nthe pocket-book, and let you make whatever you can out of it. Come,\nthat’s a good offer. What do you say?”",
        "Dick was well dressed, so that the other did not regard it as at all\nimprobable that he might possess that sum. He was prepared, however,\nto let him have it for less, if necessary.",
        "“Twenty dollars is a good deal of money,” said Dick, appearing to\nhesitate.",
        "“You’ll get it back, and a good deal more,” said the stranger,\npersuasively.",
        "“I don’t know but I shall. What would you do, Frank?”",
        "“I don’t know but I would,” said Frank, “if you’ve got the money.\"\nHe was not a little surprised to think that Dick had so much by him.",
        "“I don’t know but I will,” said Dick, after some irresolution. “I\nguess I won’t lose much.”",
        "“You can’t lose anything,” said the stranger briskly. “Only be\nquick, for I must be on my way to the cars. I am afraid I shall miss\nthem now.”",
        "Dick pulled out a bill from his pocket, and handed it to the\nstranger, receiving the pocket-book in return. At that moment a\npoliceman turned the corner, and the stranger, hurriedly thrusting\nthe bill into his pocket, without looking at it, made off with\nrapid steps.",
        "“What is there in the pocket-book, Dick?” asked Frank in some\nexcitement. “I hope there’s enough to pay you for the money you\ngave him.”",
        "Dick laughed.",
        "“I’ll risk that,” said he.",
        "“But you gave him twenty dollars. That’s a good deal of money.”",
        "“If I had given him as much as that, I should deserve to be cheated\nout of it.”",
        "“But you did,–didn’t you?”",
        "“He thought so.”",
        "“What was it, then?”",
        "“It was nothing but a dry-goods circular got up to imitate a\nbank-bill.”",
        "Frank looked sober.",
        "“You ought not to have cheated him, Dick,” he said, reproachfully.",
        "“Didn’t he want to cheat me?”",
        "“I don’t know.”",
        "“What do you s’pose there is in that pocket-book?” asked Dick,\nholding it up.",
        "Frank surveyed its ample proportions, and answered sincerely enough,\n\"Money, and a good deal of it.”",
        "“There aint stamps enough in it to buy a oyster-stew,” said Dick.\n\"If you don’t believe it, just look while I open it.”",
        "So saying he opened the pocket-book, and showed Frank that it was\nstuffed out with pieces of blank paper, carefully folded up in the\nshape of bills. Frank, who was unused to city life, and had never\nheard anything of the “drop-game” looked amazed at this unexpected\ndevelopment.",
        "“I knowed how it was all the time,” said Dick. “I guess I got the\nbest of him there. This wallet’s worth somethin’. I shall use it to\nkeep my stiffkit’s of Erie stock in, and all my other papers what\naint of no use to anybody but the owner.”",
        "“That’s the kind of papers it’s got in it now,” said Frank, smiling.",
        "“That’s so!” said Dick.",
        "“By hokey!” he exclaimed suddenly, “if there aint the old chap\ncomin’ back ag’in. He looks as if he’d heard bad news from his\nsick family.”",
        "By this time the pocket-book dropper had come up.",
        "Approaching the boys, he said in an undertone to Dick, “Give me back\nthat pocket-book, you young rascal!”",
        "“Beg your pardon, mister,” said Dick, “but was you addressin’ me?”",
        "“Yes, I was.”",
        "“’Cause you called me by the wrong name. I’ve knowed some rascals,\nbut I aint the honor to belong to the family.”",
        "He looked significantly at the other as he spoke, which didn’t\nimprove the man’s temper. Accustomed to swindle others, he did not\nfancy being practised upon in return.",
        "“Give me back that pocket-book,” he repeated in a threatening voice.",
        "“Couldn’t do it,” said Dick, coolly. “I’m go’n’ to restore it to\nthe owner. The contents is so valooable that most likely the loss\nhas made him sick, and he’ll be likely to come down liberal to the\nhonest finder.”",
        "“You gave me a bogus bill,” said the man.",
        "“It’s what I use myself,” said Dick.",
        "“You’ve swindled me.”",
        "“I thought it was the other way.”",
        "“None of your nonsense,” said the man angrily. “If you don’t give up\nthat pocket-book, I’ll call a policeman.”",
        "“I wish you would,” said Dick. “They’ll know most likely whether\nit’s Stewart or Astor that’s lost the pocket-book, and I can get ’em\nto return it.”",
        "The “dropper,” whose object it was to recover the pocket-book, in\norder to try the same game on a more satisfactory customer, was\nirritated by Dick’s refusal, and above all by the coolness he\ndisplayed. He resolved to make one more attempt.",
        "“Do you want to pass the night in the Tombs?” he asked.",
        "“Thank you for your very obligin’ proposal,” said Dick; “but it aint\nconvenient to-day. Any other time, when you’d like to have me come\nand stop with you, I’m agreeable; but my two youngest children is\ndown with the measles, and I expect I’ll have to set up all night\nto take care of ’em. Is the Tombs, in gineral, a pleasant place of\nresidence?”",
        "Dick asked this question with an air of so much earnestness that\nFrank could scarcely forbear laughing, though it is hardly necessary\nto say that the dropper was by no means so inclined.",
        "“You’ll know sometime,” he said, scowling.",
        "“I’ll make you a fair offer” said Dick. “If I get more’n fifty\ndollars as a reward for my honesty, I’ll divide with you. But I say,\naint it most time to go back to your sick family in Boston?”",
        "Finding that nothing was to be made out of Dick, the man strode away\nwith a muttered curse.",
        "“You were too smart for him, Dick,” said Frank.",
        "“Yes,” said Dick, “I aint knocked round the city streets all my life\nfor nothin’.”",
        "“Have you always lived in New York, Dick?” asked Frank, after\na pause.",
        "“Ever since I can remember.”",
        "“I wish you’d tell me a little about yourself. Have you got\nany father or mother?”",
        "“I aint got no mother. She died when I wasn’t but three years old.\nMy father went to sea; but he went off before mother died, and\nnothin’ was ever heard of him. I expect he got wrecked, or died\nat sea.”",
        "“And what became of you when your mother died?”",
        "“The folks she boarded with took care of me, but they was poor, and\nthey couldn’t do much. When I was seven the woman died, and her\nhusband went out West, and then I had to scratch for myself.”",
        "“At seven years old!” exclaimed Frank, in amazement.",
        "“Yes,” said Dick, “I was a little feller to take care of myself,\nbut,” he continued with pardonable pride, “I did it.”",
        "“What could you do?”",
        "“Sometimes one thing, and sometimes another,” said Dick. “I changed\nmy business accordin’ as I had to. Sometimes I was a newsboy, and\ndiffused intelligence among the masses, as I heard somebody say once\nin a big speech he made in the Park. Them was the times when Horace\nGreeley and James Gordon Bennett made money.”",
        "“Through your enterprise?” suggested Frank.",
        "“Yes,” said Dick; “but I give it up after a while.”",
        "“What for?”",
        "“Well, they didn’t always put news enough in their papers, and\npeople wouldn’t buy ’em as fast as I wanted ’em to. So one mornin’\nI was stuck on a lot of Heralds, and I thought I’d make a sensation.\nSo I called out ’GREAT NEWS! QUEEN VICTORIA ASSASSINATED!’ All my\nHeralds went off like hot cakes, and I went off, too, but one of\nthe gentlemen what got sold remembered me, and said he’d have me\ntook up, and that’s what made me change my business.”",
        "“That wasn’t right, Dick,” said Frank.",
        "“I know it,” said Dick; “but lots of boys does it.”",
        "“That don’t make it any better.”",
        "“No,” said Dick, “I was sort of ashamed at the time, ’specially\nabout one poor old gentleman,–a Englishman he was. He couldn’t\nhelp cryin’ to think the queen was dead, and his hands shook when\nhe handed me the money for the paper.”",
        "“What did you do next?”",
        "“I went into the match business,” said Dick; “but it was small sales\nand small profits. Most of the people I called on had just laid in\na stock, and didn’t want to buy. So one cold night, when I hadn’t\nmoney enough to pay for a lodgin’, I burned the last of my matches\nto keep me from freezin’. But it cost too much to get warm that way,\nand I couldn’t keep it up.”",
        "“You’ve seen hard times, Dick,” said Frank, compassionately.",
        "“Yes,” said Dick, “I’ve knowed what it was to be hungry and cold,\nwith nothin’ to eat or to warm me; but there’s one thing I never\ncould do,” he added, proudly.",
        "“What’s that?”",
        "“I never stole,” said Dick. “It’s mean and I wouldn’t do it.”",
        "“Were you ever tempted to?”",
        "“Lots of times. Once I had been goin’ round all day, and hadn’t sold\nany matches, except three cents’ worth early in the mornin’. With\nthat I bought an apple, thinkin’ I should get some more bimeby. When\nevenin’ come I was awful hungry. I went into a baker’s just to look\nat the bread. It made me feel kind o’ good just to look at the bread\nand cakes, and I thought maybe they would give me some. I asked ’em\nwouldn’t they give me a loaf, and take their pay in matches. But\nthey said they’d got enough matches to last three months; so there\nwasn’t any chance for a trade. While I was standin’ at the stove\nwarmin’ me, the baker went into a back room, and I felt so hungry I\nthought I would take just one loaf, and go off with it. There was\nsuch a big pile I don’t think he’d have known it.”",
        "“But you didn’t do it?”",
        "“No, I didn’t and I was glad of it, for when the man came in ag’in,\nhe said he wanted some one to carry some cake to a lady in St.\nMark’s Place. His boy was sick, and he hadn’t no one to send; so he\ntold me he’d give me ten cents if I would go. My business wasn’t\nvery pressin’ just then, so I went, and when I come back, I took my\npay in bread and cakes. Didn’t they taste good, though?”",
        "“So you didn’t stay long in the match business, Dick?”",
        "“No, I couldn’t sell enough to make it pay. Then there was some\nfolks that wanted me to sell cheaper to them; so I couldn’t make any\nprofit. There was one old lady–she was rich, too, for she lived in\na big brick house–beat me down so, that I didn’t make no profit at\nall; but she wouldn’t buy without, and I hadn’t sold none that day;\nso I let her have them. I don’t see why rich folks should be so hard\nupon a poor boy that wants to make a livin’.”",
        "“There’s a good deal of meanness in the world, I’m afraid, Dick.”",
        "“If everybody was like you and your uncle,” said Dick, “there would\nbe some chance for poor people. If I was rich I’d try to help ’em\nalong.”",
        "“Perhaps you will be rich sometime, Dick.”",
        "Dick shook his head.",
        "“I’m afraid all my wallets will be like this,” said Dick, indicating\nthe one he had received from the dropper, “and will be full of\npapers what aint of no use to anybody except the owner.”",
        "“That depends very much on yourself, Dick,” said Frank. “Stewart\nwasn’t always rich, you know.”",
        "“Wasn’t he?”",
        "“When he first came to New York as a young man he was a teacher, and\nteachers are not generally very rich. At last he went into business,\nstarting in a small way, and worked his way up by degrees. But there\nwas one thing he determined in the beginning: that he would be\nstrictly honorable in all his dealings, and never overreach any one\nfor the sake of making money. If there was a chance for him, Dick,\nthere is a chance for you.”",
        "“He knowed enough to be a teacher, and I’m awful ignorant,\"\nsaid Dick.",
        "“But you needn’t stay so.”",
        "“How can I help it?”",
        "“Can’t you learn at school?”",
        "“I can’t go to school ’cause I’ve got my livin’ to earn. It wouldn’t\ndo me much good if I learned to read and write, and just as I’d got\nlearned I starved to death.”",
        "“But are there no night-schools?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Why don’t you go? I suppose you don’t work in the evenings.”",
        "“I never cared much about it,” said Dick, “and that’s the truth. But\nsince I’ve got to talkin’ with you, I think more about it. I guess\nI’ll begin to go.”",
        "“I wish you would, Dick. You’ll make a smart man if you only get a\nlittle education.”",
        "“Do you think so?” asked Dick, doubtfully.",
        "“I know so. A boy who has earned his own living since he was seven\nyears old must have something in him. I feel very much interested in\nyou, Dick. You’ve had a hard time of it so far in life, but I think\nbetter times are in store. I want you to do well, and I feel sure\nyou can if you only try.”",
        "“You’re a good fellow,” said Dick, gratefully. “I’m afraid I’m a\npretty rough customer, but I aint as bad as some. I mean to turn\nover a new leaf, and try to grow up ’spectable.”",
        "“There’ve been a great many boys begin as low down as you, Dick,\nthat have grown up respectable and honored. But they had to work\npretty hard for it.”",
        "“I’m willin’ to work hard,” said Dick.",
        "“And you must not only work hard, but work in the right way.”",
        "“What’s the right way?”",
        "“You began in the right way when you determined never to steal, or\ndo anything mean or dishonorable, however strongly tempted to do so.\nThat will make people have confidence in you when they come to know\nyou. But, in order to succeed well, you must manage to get as good\nan education as you can. Until you do, you cannot get a position in\nan office or counting-room, even to run errands.”",
        "“That’s so,” said Dick, soberly. “I never thought how awful ignorant\nI was till now.”",
        "“That can be remedied with perseverance,” said Frank. “A year will\ndo a great deal for you.”",
        "“I’ll go to work and see what I can do,” said Dick, energetically.",
        "The boys had turned into Third Avenue, a long street, which,\ncommencing just below the Cooper Institute, runs out to Harlem. A\nman came out of a side street, uttering at intervals a monotonous\ncry which sounded like “glass puddin’.”",
        "“Glass pudding!” repeated Frank, looking in surprised wonder at\nDick. “What does he mean?”",
        "“Perhaps you’d like some,” said Dick.",
        "“I never heard of it before.”",
        "“Suppose you ask him what he charges for his puddin’.”",
        "Frank looked more narrowly at the man, and soon concluded that he\nwas a glazier.",
        "“Oh, I understand,” he said. “He means ’glass put in.’”",
        "Frank’s mistake was not a singular one. The monotonous cry of these\nmen certainly sounds more like “glass puddin’,” than the words they\nintend to utter.",
        "“Now,” said Dick, “where shall we go?”",
        "“I should like to see Central Park,” said Frank. “Is it far off?”",
        "“It is about a mile and a half from here,” said Dick. “This is\nTwenty-ninth Street, and the Park begins at Fifty-ninth Street.”",
        "It may be explained, for the benefit of readers who have never\nvisited New York, that about a mile from the City Hall the\ncross-streets begin to be numbered in regular order. There is a\ncontinuous line of houses as far as One Hundred and Thirtieth\nStreet, where may be found the terminus of the Harlem line of\nhorse-cars. When the entire island is laid out and settled, probably\nthe numbers will reach two hundred or more. Central Park, which lies\nbetween Fifty-ninth Street on the south, and One Hundred and Tenth\nStreet on the north, is true to its name, occupying about the centre\nof the island. The distance between two parallel streets is called a\nblock, and twenty blocks make a mile. It will therefore be seen that\nDick was exactly right, when he said they were a mile and a half\nfrom Central Park.",
        "“That is too far to walk,” said Frank.",
        "“’Twon’t cost but six cents to ride,” said Dick.",
        "“You mean in the horse-cars?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“All right then. We’ll jump aboard the next car.”",
        "The Third Avenue and Harlem line of horse-cars is better patronized\nthan any other in New York, though not much can be said for the\ncars, which are usually dirty and overcrowded. Still, when it is\nconsidered that only seven cents are charged for the entire distance\nto Harlem, about seven miles from the City Hall, the fare can hardly\nbe complained of. But of course most of the profit is made from the\nway-passengers who only ride a short distance.",
        "A car was at that moment approaching, but it seemed pretty crowded.",
        "“Shall we take that, or wait for another?” asked Frank.",
        "“The next’ll most likely be as bad,” said Dick.",
        "The boys accordingly signalled to the conductor to stop, and got\non the front platform. They were obliged to stand up till the car\nreached Fortieth Street, when so many of the passengers had got off\nthat they obtained seats.",
        "Frank sat down beside a middle-aged woman, or lady, as she probably\ncalled herself, whose sharp visage and thin lips did not seem to\npromise a very pleasant disposition. When the two gentlemen who sat\nbeside her arose, she spread her skirts in the endeavor to fill two\nseats. Disregarding this, the boys sat down.",
        "“There aint room for two,” she said, looking sourly at Frank.",
        "“There were two here before.”",
        "“Well, there ought not to have been. Some people like to crowd in\nwhere they’re not wanted.”",
        "“And some like to take up a double allowance of room,” thought\nFrank; but he did not say so. He saw that the woman had a bad\ntemper, and thought it wisest to say nothing.",
        "Frank had never ridden up the city as far as this, and it was with\nmuch interest that he looked out of the car windows at the stores on\neither side. Third Avenue is a broad street, but in the character\nof its houses and stores it is quite inferior to Broadway, though\nbetter than some of the avenues further east. Fifth Avenue, as most\nof my readers already know, is the finest street in the city, being\nlined with splendid private residences, occupied by the wealthier\nclasses. Many of the cross streets also boast houses which may be\nconsidered palaces, so elegant are they externally and internally.\nFrank caught glimpses of some of these as he was carried towards the\nPark.",
        "After the first conversation, already mentioned, with the lady at\nhis side, he supposed he should have nothing further to do with her.\nBut in this he was mistaken. While he was busy looking out of the\ncar window, she plunged her hand into her pocket in search of her\npurse, which she was unable to find. Instantly she jumped to the\nconclusion that it had been stolen, and her suspicions fastened upon\nFrank, with whom she was already provoked for “crowding her,” as she\ntermed it.",
        "“Conductor!” she exclaimed in a sharp voice.",
        "“What’s wanted, ma’am?” returned that functionary.",
        "“I want you to come here right off.”",
        "“What’s the matter?”",
        "“My purse has been stolen. There was four dollars and eighty cents\nin it. I know, because I counted it when I paid my fare.”",
        "“Who stole it?”",
        "“That boy,” she said pointing to Frank, who listened to the charge\nin the most intense astonishment. “He crowded in here on purpose to\nrob me, and I want you to search him right off.”",
        "“That’s a lie!” exclaimed Dick, indignantly.",
        "“Oh, you’re in league with him, I dare say,” said the woman\nspitefully. “You’re as bad as he is, I’ll be bound.”",
        "“You’re a nice female, you be!” said Dick, ironically.",
        "“Don’t you dare to call me a female, sir,” said the lady, furiously.",
        "“Why, you aint a man in disguise, be you?” said Dick.",
        "“You are very much mistaken, madam,” said Frank, quietly. “The\nconductor may search me, if you desire it.”",
        "A charge of theft, made in a crowded car, of course made quite a\nsensation. Cautious passengers instinctively put their hands on\ntheir pockets, to make sure that they, too, had not been robbed.\nAs for Frank, his face flushed, and he felt very indignant that he\nshould even be suspected of so mean a crime. He had been carefully\nbrought up, and been taught to regard stealing as low and wicked.",
        "Dick, on the contrary, thought it a capital joke that such a charge\nshould have been made against his companion. Though he had brought\nhimself up, and known plenty of boys and men, too, who would steal,\nhe had never done so himself. He thought it mean. But he could not\nbe expected to regard it as Frank did. He had been too familiar with\nit in others to look upon it with horror.",
        "Meanwhile the passengers rather sided with the boys. Appearances go\na great ways, and Frank did not look like a thief.",
        "“I think you must be mistaken, madam,” said a gentleman sitting\nopposite. “The lad does not look as if he would steal.”",
        "“You can’t tell by looks,” said the lady, sourly. “They’re\ndeceitful; villains are generally well dressed.”",
        "“Be they?” said Dick. “You’d ought to see me with my Washington coat\non. You’d think I was the biggest villain ever you saw.”",
        "“I’ve no doubt you are,” said the lady, scowling in the direction of\nour hero.",
        "“Thank you, ma’am,” said Dick. “’Tisn’t often I get such fine\ncompliments.”",
        "“None of your impudence,” said the lady, wrathfully. “I believe\nyou’re the worst of the two.”",
        "Meanwhile the car had been stopped.",
        "“How long are we going to stop here?” demanded a passenger,\nimpatiently. “I’m in a hurry, if none of the rest of you are.”",
        "“I want my pocket-book,” said the lady, defiantly.",
        "“Well, ma’am, I haven’t got it, and I don’t see as it’s doing you\nany good detaining us all here.”",
        "“Conductor, will you call a policeman to search that young scamp?\"\ncontinued the aggrieved lady. “You don’t expect I’m going to lose my\nmoney, and do nothing about it.”",
        "“I’ll turn my pockets inside out if you want me to,” said Frank,\nproudly. “There’s no need of a policeman. The conductor, or any one\nelse, may search me.”",
        "“Well, youngster,” said the conductor, “if the lady agrees, I’ll\nsearch you.”",
        "The lady signified her assent.",
        "Frank accordingly turned his pockets inside out, but nothing was\nrevealed except his own porte-monnaie and a penknife.",
        "“Well, ma’am, are you satisfied?” asked the conductor.",
        "“No, I aint,” said she, decidedly.",
        "“You don’t think he’s got it still?”",
        "“No, but he’s passed it over to his confederate, that boy there\nthat’s so full of impudence.”",
        "“That’s me,” said Dick, comically.",
        "“He confesses it,” said the lady; “I want him searched.”",
        "“All right,” said Dick, “I’m ready for the operation, only, as I’ve\ngot valooable property about me, be careful not to drop any of my\nErie Bonds.”",
        "The conductor’s hand forthwith dove into Dick’s pocket, and drew out\na rusty jack-knife, a battered cent, about fifty cents in change,\nand the capacious pocket-book which he had received from the\nswindler who was anxious to get back to his sick family in Boston.",
        "“Is that yours, ma’am?” asked the conductor, holding up the wallet\nwhich excited some amazement, by its size, among the other\npassengers.",
        "“It seems to me you carry a large pocket-book for a young man of\nyour age,” said the conductor.",
        "“That’s what I carry my cash and valooable papers in,” said Dick.",
        "“I suppose that isn’t yours, ma’am,” said the conductor, turning to\nthe lady.",
        "“No,” said she, scornfully. “I wouldn’t carry round such a great\nwallet as that. Most likely he’s stolen it from somebody else.”",
        "“What a prime detective you’d be!” said Dick. “P’rhaps you know who\nI took it from.”",
        "“I don’t know but my money’s in it,” said the lady, sharply.\n\"Conductor, will you open that wallet, and see what there is in it?”",
        "“Don’t disturb the valooable papers,” said Dick, in a tone of\npretended anxiety.",
        "The contents of the wallet excited some amusement among the\npassengers.",
        "“There don’t seem to be much money here,” said the conductor, taking\nout a roll of tissue paper cut out in the shape of bills, and rolled\nup.",
        "“No,” said Dick. “Didn’t I tell you them were papers of no valoo to\nanybody but the owner? If the lady’d like to borrow, I won’t charge\nno interest.”",
        "“Where is my money, then?” said the lady, in some discomfiture. “I\nshouldn’t wonder if one of the young scamps had thrown it out of the\nwindow.”",
        "“You’d better search your pocket once more,” said the gentleman\nopposite. “I don’t believe either of the boys is in fault. They\ndon’t look to me as if they would steal.”",
        "“Thank you, sir,” said Frank.",
        "The lady followed out the suggestion, and, plunging her hand once\nmore into her pocket, drew out a small porte-monnaie. She hardly\nknew whether to be glad or sorry at this discovery. It placed her\nin rather an awkward position after the fuss she had made, and the\ndetention to which she had subjected the passengers, now, as it\nproved, for nothing.",
        "“Is that the pocket-book you thought stolen?” asked the conductor.",
        "“Yes,” said she, rather confusedly.",
        "“Then you’ve been keeping me waiting all this time for nothing,” he\nsaid, sharply. “I wish you’d take care to be sure next time before\nyou make such a disturbance for nothing. I’ve lost five minutes, and\nshall not be on time.”",
        "“I can’t help it,” was the cross reply; “I didn’t know it was in my\npocket.”",
        "“It seems to me you owe an apology to the boys you accused of a\ntheft which they have not committed,” said the gentleman opposite.",
        "“I shan’t apologize to anybody,” said the lady, whose temper was not\nof the best; “least of all to such whipper-snappers as they are.”",
        "“Thank you, ma’am,” said Dick, comically; “your handsome apology is\naccepted. It aint of no consequence, only I didn’t like to expose\nthe contents of my valooable pocket-book, for fear it might excite\nthe envy of some of my poor neighbors.”",
        "“You’re a character,” said the gentleman who had already spoken,\nwith a smile.",
        "“A bad character!” muttered the lady.",
        "But it was quite evident that the sympathies of those present were\nagainst the lady, and on the side of the boys who had been falsely\naccused, while Dick’s drollery had created considerable amusement.",
        "The cars had now reached Fifty-ninth Street, the southern boundary\nof the Park, and here our hero and his companion got off.",
        "“You’d better look out for pickpockets, my lad,” said the conductor,\npleasantly. “That big wallet of yours might prove a great\ntemptation.”",
        "“That’s so,” said Dick. “That’s the misfortin’ of being rich. Astor\nand me don’t sleep much for fear of burglars breakin’ in and robbin’\nus of our valooable treasures. Sometimes I think I’ll give all my\nmoney to an Orphan Asylum, and take it out in board. I guess I’d\nmake money by the operation.”",
        "While Dick was speaking, the car rolled away, and the boys turned\nup Fifty-ninth Street, for two long blocks yet separated them from\nthe Park.",
        "“What a queer chap you are, Dick!” said Frank, laughing. “You always\nseem to be in good spirits.”",
        "“No, I aint always. Sometimes I have the blues.”",
        "“When?”",
        "“Well, once last winter it was awful cold, and there was big holes\nin my shoes, and my gloves and all my warm clothes was at the\ntailor’s. I felt as if life was sort of tough, and I’d like it if\nsome rich man would adopt me, and give me plenty to eat and drink\nand wear, without my havin’ to look so sharp after it. Then agin’\nwhen I’ve seen boys with good homes, and fathers, and mothers, I’ve\nthought I’d like to have somebody to care for me.”",
        "Dick’s tone changed as he said this, from his usual levity, and\nthere was a touch of sadness in it. Frank, blessed with a good home\nand indulgent parents, could not help pitying the friendless boy who\nhad found life such up-hill work.",
        "“Don’t say you have no one to care for you, Dick,” he said, lightly\nlaying his hand on Dick’s shoulder. “I will care for you.”",
        "“Will you?”",
        "“If you will let me.”",
        "“I wish you would,” said Dick, earnestly. “I’d like to feel that I\nhave one friend who cares for me.”",
        "Central Park was now before them, but it was far from presenting\nthe appearance which it now exhibits. It had not been long since\nwork had been commenced upon it, and it was still very rough and\nunfinished. A rough tract of land, two miles and a half from north\nto south, and a half a mile broad, very rocky in parts, was the\nmaterial from which the Park Commissioners have made the present\nbeautiful enclosure. There were no houses of good appearance near\nit, buildings being limited mainly to rude temporary huts used by\nthe workmen who were employed in improving it. The time will\nundoubtedly come when the Park will be surrounded by elegant\nresidences, and compare favorably in this respect with the most\nattractive parts of any city in the world. But at the time when\nFrank and Dick visited it, not much could be said in favor either\nof the Park or its neighborhood.",
        "“If this is Central Park,” said Frank, who naturally felt\ndisappointed, “I don’t think much of it. My father’s got a large\npasture that is much nicer.”",
        "“It’ll look better some time,” said Dick. “There aint much to see\nnow but rocks. We will take a walk over it if you want to.”",
        "“No,” said Frank, “I’ve seen as much of it as I want to. Besides, I\nfeel tired.”",
        "“Then we’ll go back. We can take the Sixth Avenue cars. They will\nbring us out at Vesey Street just beside the Astor House.”",
        "“All right,” said Frank. “That will be the best course. I hope,” he\nadded, laughing, “our agreeable lady friend won’t be there. I don’t\ncare about being accused of stealing again.”",
        "“She was a tough one,” said Dick. “Wouldn’t she make a nice wife for\na man that likes to live in hot water, and didn’t mind bein’ scalded\ntwo or three times a day?”",
        "“Yes, I think she’d just suit him. Is that the right car, Dick?”",
        "“Yes, jump in, and I’ll follow.”",
        "The Sixth Avenue is lined with stores, many of them of very good\nappearance, and would make a very respectable principal street for a\ngood-sized city. But it is only one of several long business streets\nwhich run up the island, and illustrate the extent and importance of\nthe city to which they belong.",
        "No incidents worth mentioning took place during their ride down\ntown. In about three-quarters of an hour the boys got out of the car\nbeside the Astor House.",
        "“Are you goin’ in now, Frank?” asked Dick.",
        "“That depends upon whether you have anything else to show me.”",
        "“Wouldn’t you like to go to Wall Street?”",
        "“That’s the street where there are so many bankers and brokers,–isn’t\nit?”",
        "“Yes, I s’pose you aint afraid of bulls and bears,–are you?”",
        "“Bulls and bears?” repeated Frank, puzzled.",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“What are they?”",
        "“The bulls is what tries to make the stocks go up, and the bears is\nwhat try to growl ’em down.”",
        "“Oh, I see. Yes, I’d like to go.”",
        "Accordingly they walked down on the west side of Broadway as far as\nTrinity Church, and then, crossing, entered a street not very wide\nor very long, but of very great importance. The reader would be\nastonished if he could know the amount of money involved in the\ntransactions which take place in a single day in this street. It\nwould be found that although Broadway is much greater in length, and\nlined with stores, it stands second to Wall Street in this respect.",
        "“What is that large marble building?” asked Frank, pointing to a\nmassive structure on the corner of Wall and Nassau Streets. It was\nin the form of a parallelogram, two hundred feet long by ninety\nwide, and about eighty feet in height, the ascent to the entrance\nbeing by eighteen granite steps.",
        "“That’s the Custom House,” said Dick.",
        "“It looks like pictures I’ve seen of the Parthenon at Athens,” said\nFrank, meditatively.",
        "“Where’s Athens?” asked Dick. “It aint in York State,–is it?”",
        "“Not the Athens I mean, at any rate. It is in Greece, and was a\nfamous city two thousand years ago.”",
        "“That’s longer than I can remember,” said Dick. “I can’t remember\ndistinctly more’n about a thousand years.”",
        "“What a chap you are, Dick! Do you know if we can go in?”",
        "The boys ascertained, after a little inquiry, that they would be\nallowed to do so. They accordingly entered the Custom House and made\ntheir way up to the roof, from which they had a fine view of the\nharbor, the wharves crowded with shipping, and the neighboring\nshores of Long Island and New Jersey. Towards the north they looked\ndown for many miles upon continuous lines of streets, and thousands\nof roofs, with here and there a church-spire rising above its\nneighbors. Dick had never before been up there, and he, as well as\nFrank, was interested in the grand view spread before them.",
        "At length they descended, and were going down the granite steps on\nthe outside of the building, when they were addressed by a young\nman, whose appearance is worth describing.",
        "He was tall, and rather loosely put together, with small eyes and\nrather a prominent nose. His clothing had evidently not been\nfurnished by a city tailor. He wore a blue coat with brass buttons,\nand pantaloons of rather scanty dimensions, which were several\ninches too short to cover his lower limbs. He held in his hand a\npiece of paper, and his countenance wore a look of mingled\nbewilderment and anxiety.",
        "“Be they a-payin’ out money inside there?” he asked, indicating the\ninterior by a motion of his hand.",
        "“I guess so,” said Dick. “Are you a-goin’ in for some?”",
        "“Wal, yes. I’ve got an order here for sixty dollars,–made a kind of\nspeculation this morning.”",
        "“How was it?” asked Frank.",
        "“Wal, you see I brought down some money to put in the bank, fifty\ndollars it was, and I hadn’t justly made up my mind what bank to put\nit into, when a chap came up in a terrible hurry, and said it was\nvery unfortunate, but the bank wasn’t open, and he must have some\nmoney right off. He was obliged to go out of the city by the next\ntrain. I asked him how much he wanted. He said fifty dollars. I told\nhim I’d got that, and he offered me a check on the bank for sixty,\nand I let him have it. I thought that was a pretty easy way to earn\nten dollars, so I counted out the money and he went off. He told\nme I’d hear a bell ring when they began to pay out money. But I’ve\nwaited most two hours, and I haint heard it yet. I’d ought to be\ngoin’, for I told dad I’d be home to-night. Do you think I can get\nthe money now?”",
        "“Will you show me the check?” asked Frank, who had listened\nattentively to the countryman’s story, and suspected that he had\nbeen made the victim of a swindler. It was made out upon the\n\"Washington Bank,” in the sum of sixty dollars, and was signed\n\"Ephraim Smith.”",
        "“Washington Bank!” repeated Frank. “Dick, is there such a bank in\nthe city?”",
        "“Not as I knows on,” said Dick. “Leastways I don’t own any shares\nin it.”",
        "“Aint this the Washington Bank?” asked the countryman, pointing to\nthe building on the steps of which the three were now standing.",
        "“No, it’s the Custom House.”",
        "“And won’t they give me any money for this?” asked the young man,\nthe perspiration standing on his brow.",
        "“I am afraid the man who gave it to you was a swindler,” said\nFrank, gently.",
        "“And won’t I ever see my fifty dollars again?” asked the youth in\nagony.",
        "“I am afraid not.”",
        "“What’ll dad say?” ejaculated the miserable youth. “It makes me feel\nsick to think of it. I wish I had the feller here. I’d shake him out\nof his boots.”",
        "“What did he look like? I’ll call a policeman and you shall describe\nhim. Perhaps in that way you can get track of your money.”",
        "Dick called a policeman, who listened to the description, and\nrecognized the operator as an experienced swindler. He assured the\ncountryman that there was very little chance of his ever seeing his\nmoney again. The boys left the miserable youth loudly bewailing his\nbad luck, and proceeded on their way down the street.",
        "“He’s a baby,” said Dick, contemptuously. “He’d ought to know how to\ntake care of himself and his money. A feller has to look sharp in\nthis city, or he’ll lose his eye-teeth before he knows it.”",
        "“I suppose you never got swindled out of fifty dollars, Dick?”",
        "“No, I don’t carry no such small bills. I wish I did,” he added.",
        "“So do I, Dick. What’s that building there at the end of the street?”",
        "“That’s the Wall-Street Ferry to Brooklyn.”",
        "“How long does it take to go across?”",
        "“Not more’n five minutes.”",
        "“Suppose we just ride over and back.”",
        "“All right!” said Dick. “It’s rather expensive; but if you don’t\nmind, I don’t.”",
        "“Why, how much does it cost?”",
        "“Two cents apiece.”",
        "“I guess I can stand that. Let us go.”",
        "They passed the gate, paying the fare to a man who stood at the\nentrance, and were soon on the ferry-boat, bound for Brooklyn.",
        "They had scarcely entered the boat, when Dick, grasping Frank\nby the arm, pointed to a man just outside of the gentlemen’s cabin.",
        "“Do you see that man, Frank?” he inquired.",
        "“Yes, what of him?”",
        "“He’s the man that cheated the country chap out of his fifty dollars.”",
        "Dick’s ready identification of the rogue who had cheated the\ncountryman, surprised Frank.",
        "“What makes you think it is he?” he asked.",
        "“Because I’ve seen him before, and I know he’s up to them kind of\ntricks. When I heard how he looked, I was sure I knowed him.”",
        "“Our recognizing him won’t be of much use,” said Frank. “It won’t\ngive back the countryman his money.”",
        "“I don’t know,” said Dick, thoughtfully. “May be I can get it.”",
        "“How?” asked Frank, incredulously.",
        "“Wait a minute, and you’ll see.”",
        "Dick left his companion, and went up to the man whom he suspected.",
        "“Ephraim Smith,” said Dick, in a low voice.",
        "The man turned suddenly, and looked at Dick uneasily.",
        "“What did you say?” he asked.",
        "“I believe your name is Ephraim Smith,” continued Dick.",
        "“You’re mistaken,” said the man, and was about to move off.",
        "“Stop a minute,” said Dick. “Don’t you keep your money in the\nWashington Bank?”",
        "“I don’t know any such bank. I’m in a hurry, young man, and I can’t\nstop to answer any foolish questions.”",
        "The boat had by this time reached the Brooklyn pier, and Mr. Ephraim\nSmith seemed in a hurry to land.",
        "“Look here,” said Dick, significantly; “you’d better not go on shore\nunless you want to jump into the arms of a policeman.”",
        "“What do you mean?” asked the man, startled.",
        "“That little affair of yours is known to the police,” said Dick;\n\"about how you got fifty dollars out of a greenhorn on a false\ncheck, and it mayn’t be safe for you to go ashore.”",
        "“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said the swindler with\naffected boldness, though Dick could see that he was ill at ease.",
        "“Yes you do,” said Dick. “There isn’t but one thing to do. Just give\nme back that money, and I’ll see that you’re not touched. If you\ndon’t, I’ll give you up to the first p’liceman we meet.”",
        "Dick looked so determined, and spoke so confidently, that the other,\novercome by his fears, no longer hesitated, but passed a roll of\nbills to Dick and hastily left the boat.",
        "All this Frank witnessed with great amazement, not understanding\nwhat influence Dick could have obtained over the swindler sufficient\nto compel restitution.",
        "“How did you do it?” he asked eagerly.",
        "“I told him I’d exert my influence with the president to have him\ntried by habeas corpus,” said Dick.",
        "“And of course that frightened him. But tell me, without joking, how\nyou managed.”",
        "Dick gave a truthful account of what occurred, and then said, “Now\nwe’ll go back and carry the money.”",
        "“Suppose we don’t find the poor countryman?”",
        "“Then the p’lice will take care of it.”",
        "They remained on board the boat, and in five minutes were again in\nNew York. Going up Wall Street, they met the countryman a little\ndistance from the Custom House. His face was marked with the traces\nof deep anguish; but in his case even grief could not subdue the\ncravings of appetite. He had purchased some cakes of one of the old\nwomen who spread out for the benefit of passers-by an array of\napples and seed-cakes, and was munching them with melancholy\nsatisfaction.",
        "“Hilloa!” said Dick. “Have you found your money?”",
        "“No,” ejaculated the young man, with a convulsive gasp. “I shan’t\never see it again. The mean skunk’s cheated me out of it. Consarn\nhis picter! It took me most six months to save it up. I was workin’\nfor Deacon Pinkham in our place. Oh, I wish I’d never come to New\nYork! The deacon, he told me he’d keep it for me; but I wanted to\nput it in the bank, and now it’s all gone, boo hoo!”",
        "And the miserable youth, having despatched his cakes, was so\novercome by the thought of his loss that he burst into tears.",
        "“I say,” said Dick, “dry up, and see what I’ve got here.”",
        "The youth no sooner saw the roll of bills, and comprehended that it\nwas indeed his lost treasure, than from the depths of anguish he was\nexalted to the most ecstatic joy. He seized Dick’s hand, and shook\nit with so much energy that our hero began to feel rather alarmed\nfor its safety.",
        "“’Pears to me you take my arm for a pump-handle,” said he. “Couldn’t\nyou show your gratitood some other way? It’s just possible I may\nwant to use my arm ag’in some time.”",
        "The young man desisted, but invited Dick most cordially to come up\nand stop a week with him at his country home, assuring him that he\nwouldn’t charge him anything for board.",
        "“All right!” said Dick. “If you don’t mind I’ll bring my wife along,\ntoo. She’s delicate, and the country air might do her good.”",
        "Jonathan stared at him in amazement, uncertain whether to credit the\nfact of his marriage. Dick walked on with Frank, leaving him in an\napparent state of stupefaction, and it is possible that he has not\nyet settled the affair to his satisfaction.",
        "“Now,” said Frank, “I think I’ll go back to the Astor House. Uncle\nhas probably got through his business and returned.”",
        "“All right,” said Dick.",
        "The two boys walked up to Broadway, just where the tall steeple of\nTrinity faces the street of bankers and brokers, and walked\nleisurely to the hotel. When they arrived at the Astor House, Dick\nsaid, “Good-by, Frank.”",
        "“Not yet,” said Frank; “I want you to come in with me.”",
        "Dick followed his young patron up the steps. Frank went to the\nreading-room, where, as he had thought probable, he found his uncle\nalready arrived, and reading a copy of “The Evening Post,” which he\nhad just purchased outside.",
        "“Well, boys,” he said, looking up, “have you had a pleasant jaunt?”",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Frank. “Dick’s a capital guide.”",
        "“So this is Dick,” said Mr. Whitney, surveying him with a smile.\n\"Upon my word, I should hardly have known him. I must congratulate\nhim on his improved appearance.”",
        "“Frank’s been very kind to me,” said Dick, who, rough street-boy as\nhe was, had a heart easily touched by kindness, of which he had\nnever experienced much. “He’s a tip-top fellow.”",
        "“I believe he is a good boy,” said Mr. Whitney. “I hope, my lad, you\nwill prosper and rise in the world. You know in this free country\npoverty in early life is no bar to a man’s advancement. I haven’t\nrisen very high myself,” he added, with a smile, “but have met with\nmoderate success in life; yet there was a time when I was as poor as\nyou.”",
        "“Were you, sir,” asked Dick, eagerly.",
        "“Yes, my boy, I have known the time I have been obliged to go\nwithout my dinner because I didn’t have enough money to pay for it.”",
        "“How did you get up in the world,” asked Dick, anxiously.",
        "“I entered a printing-office as an apprentice, and worked for some\nyears. Then my eyes gave out and I was obliged to give that up. Not\nknowing what else to do, I went into the country, and worked on a\nfarm. After a while I was lucky enough to invent a machine, which\nhas brought me in a great deal of money. But there was one thing I\ngot while I was in the printing-office which I value more than\nmoney.”",
        "“What was that, sir?”",
        "“A taste for reading and study. During my leisure hours I improved\nmyself by study, and acquired a large part of the knowledge which I\nnow possess. Indeed, it was one of my books that first put me on the\ntrack of the invention, which I afterwards made. So you see, my lad,\nthat my studious habits paid me in money, as well as in another\nway.”",
        "“I’m awful ignorant,” said Dick, soberly.",
        "“But you are young, and, I judge, a smart boy. If you try to learn,\nyou can, and if you ever expect to do anything in the world, you\nmust know something of books.”",
        "“I will,” said Dick, resolutely. “I aint always goin’ to black boots\nfor a livin’.”",
        "“All labor is respectable, my lad, and you have no cause to be\nashamed of any honest business; yet when you can get something to do\nthat promises better for your future prospects, I advise you to do\nso. Till then earn your living in the way you are accustomed to,\navoid extravagance, and save up a little money if you can.”",
        "“Thank you for your advice,” said our hero. “There aint many that\ntakes an interest in Ragged Dick.”",
        "“So that’s your name,” said Mr. Whitney. “If I judge you rightly,\nit won’t be long before you change it. Save your money, my lad,\nbuy books, and determine to be somebody, and you may yet fill an\nhonorable position.”",
        "“I’ll try,” said Dick. “Good-night, sir.”",
        "“Wait a minute, Dick,” said Frank. “Your blacking-box and old\nclothes are upstairs. You may want them.”",
        "“In course,” said Dick. “I couldn’t get along without my best\nclothes, and my stock in trade.”",
        "“You may go up to the room with him, Frank,” said Mr. Whitney. “The\nclerk will give you the key. I want to see you, Dick, before you\ngo.”",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Dick.",
        "“Where are you going to sleep to-night, Dick?” asked Frank, as they\nwent upstairs together.",
        "“P’r’aps at the Fifth Avenue Hotel–on the outside,” said Dick.",
        "“Haven’t you any place to sleep, then?”",
        "“I slept in a box, last night.”",
        "“In a box?”",
        "“Yes, on Spruce Street.”",
        "“Poor fellow!” said Frank, compassionately.",
        "“Oh, ’twas a bully bed–full of straw! I slept like a top.”",
        "“Don’t you earn enough to pay for a room, Dick?”",
        "“Yes,” said Dick; “only I spend my money foolish, goin’ to the Old\nBowery, and Tony Pastor’s, and sometimes gamblin’ in Baxter Street.”",
        "“You won’t gamble any more,–will you, Dick?” said Frank, laying his\nhand persuasively on his companion’s shoulder.",
        "“No, I won’t,” said Dick.",
        "“You’ll promise?”",
        "“Yes, and I’ll keep it. You’re a good feller. I wish you was goin’\nto be in New York.”",
        "“I am going to a boarding-school in Connecticut. The name of the\ntown is Barnton. Will you write to me, Dick?”",
        "“My writing would look like hens’ tracks,” said our hero.",
        "“Never mind. I want you to write. When you write you can tell me how\nto direct, and I will send you a letter.”",
        "“I wish you would,” said Dick. “I wish I was more like you.”",
        "“I hope you will make a much better boy, Dick. Now we’ll go in to my\nuncle. He wishes to see you before you go.”",
        "They went into the reading-room. Dick had wrapped up his\nblacking-brush in a newspaper with which Frank had supplied him,\nfeeling that a guest of the Astor House should hardly be seen\ncoming out of the hotel displaying such a professional sign.",
        "“Uncle, Dick’s ready to go,” said Frank.",
        "“Good-by, my lad,” said Mr. Whitney. “I hope to hear good accounts\nof you sometime. Don’t forget what I have told you. Remember that\nyour future position depends mainly upon yourself, and that it will\nbe high or low as you choose to make it.”",
        "He held out his hand, in which was a five-dollar bill. Dick shrunk\nback.",
        "“I don’t like to take it,” he said. “I haven’t earned it.”",
        "“Perhaps not,” said Mr. Whitney; “but I give it to you because I\nremember my own friendless youth. I hope it may be of service to\nyou. Sometime when you are a prosperous man, you can repay it in the\nform of aid to some poor boy, who is struggling upward as you are\nnow.”",
        "“I will, sir,” said Dick, manfully.",
        "He no longer refused the money, but took it gratefully, and, bidding\nFrank and his uncle good-by, went out into the street. A feeling of\nloneliness came over him as he left the presence of Frank, for whom\nhe had formed a strong attachment in the few hours he had known him.",
        "Going out into the fresh air Dick felt the pangs of hunger. He\naccordingly went to a restaurant and got a substantial supper.\nPerhaps it was the new clothes he wore, which made him feel a\nlittle more aristocratic. At all events, instead of patronizing the\ncheap restaurant where he usually procured his meals, he went into\nthe refectory attached to Lovejoy’s Hotel, where the prices were\nhigher and the company more select. In his ordinary dress, Dick\nwould have been excluded, but now he had the appearance of a very\nrespectable, gentlemanly boy, whose presence would not discredit\nany establishment. His orders were therefore received with attention\nby the waiter and in due time a good supper was placed before him.",
        "“I wish I could come here every day,” thought Dick. “It seems kind\no’ nice and ’spectable, side of the other place. There’s a gent at\nthat other table that I’ve shined boots for more’n once. He don’t\nknow me in my new clothes. Guess he don’t know his boot-black\npatronizes the same establishment.”",
        "His supper over, Dick went up to the desk, and, presenting his\ncheck, tendered in payment his five-dollar bill, as if it were one\nof a large number which he possessed. Receiving back his change he\nwent out into the street.",
        "Two questions now arose: How should he spend the evening, and where\nshould he pass the night? Yesterday, with such a sum of money in his\npossession, he would have answered both questions readily. For the\nevening, he would have passed it at the Old Bowery, and gone to\nsleep in any out-of-the-way place that offered. But he had turned\nover a new leaf, or resolved to do so. He meant to save his money\nfor some useful purpose,–to aid his advancement in the world. So he\ncould not afford the theatre. Besides, with his new clothes, he was\nunwilling to pass the night out of doors.",
        "“I should spile ’em,” he thought, “and that wouldn’t pay.”",
        "So he determined to hunt up a room which he could occupy regularly,\nand consider as his own, where he could sleep nights, instead of\ndepending on boxes and old wagons for a chance shelter. This would\nbe the first step towards respectability, and Dick determined to\ntake it.",
        "He accordingly passed through the City Hall Park, and walked\nleisurely up Centre Street.",
        "He decided that it would hardly be advisable for him to seek\nlodgings in Fifth Avenue, although his present cash capital\nconsisted of nearly five dollars in money, besides the valuable\npapers contained in his wallet. Besides, he had reason to doubt\nwhether any in his line of business lived on that aristocratic\nstreet. He took his way to Mott Street, which is considerably less\npretentious, and halted in front of a shabby brick lodging-house\nkept by a Mrs. Mooney, with whose son Tom, Dick was acquainted.",
        "Dick rang the bell, which sent back a shrill metallic response.",
        "The door was opened by a slatternly servant, who looked at him\ninquiringly, and not without curiosity. It must be remembered that\nDick was well dressed, and that nothing in his appearance bespoke\nhis occupation. Being naturally a good-looking boy, he might readily\nbe mistaken for a gentleman’s son.",
        "“Well, Queen Victoria,” said Dick, “is your missus at home?”",
        "“My name’s Bridget,” said the girl.",
        "“Oh, indeed!” said Dick. “You looked so much like the queen’s picter\nwhat she gave me last Christmas in exchange for mine, that I\ncouldn’t help calling you by her name.”",
        "“Oh, go along wid ye!” said Bridget. “It’s makin’ fun ye are.”",
        "“If you don’t believe me,” said Dick, gravely, “all you’ve got to do\nis to ask my partic’lar friend, the Duke of Newcastle.”",
        "“Bridget!” called a shrill voice from the basement.",
        "“The missus is calling me,” said Bridget, hurriedly. “I’ll tell her\nye want her.”",
        "“All right!” said Dick.",
        "The servant descended into the lower regions, and in a short time a\nstout, red-faced woman appeared on the scene.",
        "“Well, sir, what’s your wish?” she asked.",
        "“Have you got a room to let?” asked Dick.",
        "“Is it for yourself you ask?” questioned the woman, in some surprise.",
        "Dick answered in the affirmative.",
        "“I haven’t got any very good rooms vacant. There’s a small room in\nthe third story.”",
        "“I’d like to see it,” said Dick.",
        "“I don’t know as it would be good enough for you,” said the woman,\nwith a glance at Dick’s clothes.",
        "“I aint very partic’lar about accommodations,” said our hero. “I\nguess I’ll look at it.”",
        "Dick followed the landlady up two narrow stair-cases, uncarpeted\nand dirty, to the third landing, where he was ushered into a room\nabout ten feet square. It could not be considered a very desirable\napartment. It had once been covered with an oilcloth carpet, but\nthis was now very ragged, and looked worse than none. There was a\nsingle bed in the corner, covered with an indiscriminate heap of\nbed-clothing, rumpled and not over-clean. There was a bureau, with\nthe veneering scratched and in some parts stripped off, and a small\nglass, eight inches by ten, cracked across the middle; also two\nchairs in rather a disjointed condition. Judging from Dick’s\nappearance, Mrs. Mooney thought he would turn from it in disdain.",
        "But it must be remembered that Dick’s past experience had not been\nof a character to make him fastidious. In comparison with a box, or\nan empty wagon, even this little room seemed comfortable. He decided\nto hire it if the rent proved reasonable.",
        "“Well, what’s the tax?” asked Dick.",
        "“I ought to have a dollar a week,” said Mrs. Mooney, hesitatingly.",
        "“Say seventy-five cents, and I’ll take it,” said Dick.",
        "“Every week in advance?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Well, as times is hard, and I can’t afford to keep it empty, you\nmay have it. When will you come?”",
        "“To-night,” said Dick.",
        "“It aint lookin’ very neat. I don’t know as I can fix it up\nto-night.”",
        "“Well, I’ll sleep here to-night, and you can fix it up to-morrow.”",
        "“I hope you’ll excuse the looks. I’m a lone woman, and my help is so\nshiftless, I have to look after everything myself; so I can’t keep\nthings as straight as I want to.”",
        "“All right!” said Dick.",
        "“Can you pay me the first week in advance?” asked the landlady,\ncautiously.",
        "Dick responded by drawing seventy-five cents from his pocket, and\nplacing it in her hand.",
        "“What’s your business, sir, if I may inquire?” said Mrs. Mooney.",
        "“Oh, I’m professional!” said Dick.",
        "“Indeed!” said the landlady, who did not feel much enlightened by\nthis answer.",
        "“How’s Tom?” asked Dick.",
        "“Do you know my Tom?” said Mrs. Mooney in surprise. “He’s gone to\nsea,–to Californy. He went last week.”",
        "“Did he?” said Dick. “Yes, I knew him.”",
        "Mrs. Mooney looked upon her new lodger with increased favor, on\nfinding that he was acquainted with her son, who, by the way, was\none of the worst young scamps in Mott Street, which is saying\nconsiderable.",
        "“I’ll bring over my baggage from the Astor House this evening,” said\nDick in a tone of importance.",
        "“From the Astor House!” repeated Mrs. Mooney, in fresh amazement.",
        "“Yes, I’ve been stoppin’ there a short time with some friends,” said\nDick.",
        "Mrs. Mooney might be excused for a little amazement at finding that\na guest from the Astor House was about to become one of her\nlodgers–such transfers not being common.",
        "“Did you say you was purfessional?” she asked.",
        "“Yes, ma’am,” said Dick, politely.",
        "“You aint a–a–” Mrs. Mooney paused, uncertain what conjecture to\nhazard.",
        "“Oh, no, nothing of the sort,” said Dick, promptly. “How could you\nthink so, Mrs. Mooney?”",
        "“No offence, sir,” said the landlady, more perplexed than ever.",
        "“Certainly not,” said our hero. “But you must excuse me now, Mrs.\nMooney, as I have business of great importance to attend to.”",
        "“You’ll come round this evening?”",
        "Dick answered in the affirmative, and turned away.",
        "“I wonder what he is!” thought the landlady, following him with her\neyes as he crossed the street. “He’s got good clothes on, but he\ndon’t seem very particular about his room. Well; I’ve got all my\nrooms full now. That’s one comfort.”",
        "Dick felt more comfortable now that he had taken the decisive step\nof hiring a lodging, and paying a week’s rent in advance. For seven\nnights he was sure of a shelter and a bed to sleep in. The thought\nwas a pleasant one to our young vagrant, who hitherto had seldom\nknown when he rose in the morning where he should find a\nresting-place at night.",
        "“I must bring my traps round,” said Dick to himself. “I guess I’ll\ngo to bed early to-night. It’ll feel kinder good to sleep in a\nreg’lar bed. Boxes is rather hard to the back, and aint comfortable\nin case of rain. I wonder what Johnny Nolan would say if he knew I’d\ngot a room of my own.”",
        "About nine o’clock Dick sought his new lodgings. In his hands he\ncarried his professional wardrobe, namely, the clothes which he\nhad worn at the commencement of the day, and the implements of his\nbusiness. These he stowed away in the bureau drawers, and by the\nlight of a flickering candle took off his clothes and went to\nbed. Dick had a good digestion and a reasonably good conscience;\nconsequently he was a good sleeper. Perhaps, too, the soft feather\nbed conduced to slumber. At any rate his eyes were soon closed,\nand he did not awake until half-past six the next morning.",
        "He lifted himself on his elbow, and stared around him in transient\nbewilderment.",
        "“Blest if I hadn’t forgot where I was,” he said to himself. “So this\nis my room, is it? Well, it seems kind of ’spectable to have a room\nand a bed to sleep in. I’d orter be able to afford seventy-five\ncents a week. I’ve throwed away more money than that in one evenin’.\nThere aint no reason why I shouldn’t live ’spectable. I wish I\nknowed as much as Frank. He’s a tip-top feller. Nobody ever cared\nenough for me before to give me good advice. It was kicks, and\ncuffs, and swearin’ at me all the time. I’d like to show him I can\ndo something.”",
        "While Dick was indulging in these reflections, he had risen from\nbed, and, finding an accession to the furniture of his room, in the\nshape of an ancient wash-stand bearing a cracked bowl and broken\npitcher, indulged himself in the rather unusual ceremony of a good\nwash. On the whole, Dick preferred to be clean, but it was not\nalways easy to gratify his desire. Lodging in the street as he had\nbeen accustomed to do, he had had no opportunity to perform his\ntoilet in the customary manner. Even now he found himself unable to\narrange his dishevelled locks, having neither comb nor brush. He\ndetermined to purchase a comb, at least, as soon as possible, and a\nbrush too, if he could get one cheap. Meanwhile he combed his hair\nwith his fingers as well as he could, though the result was not\nquite so satisfactory as it might have been.",
        "A question now came up for consideration. For the first time in\nhis life Dick possessed two suits of clothes. Should he put on the\nclothes Frank had given him, or resume his old rags?",
        "Now, twenty-four hours before, at the time Dick was introduced to\nthe reader’s notice, no one could have been less fastidious as to\nhis clothing than he. Indeed, he had rather a contempt for good\nclothes, or at least he thought so. But now, as he surveyed the\nragged and dirty coat and the patched pants, Dick felt ashamed of\nthem. He was unwilling to appear in the streets with them. Yet, if\nhe went to work in his new suit, he was in danger of spoiling it,\nand he might not have it in his power to purchase a new one. Economy\ndictated a return to the old garments. Dick tried them on, and\nsurveyed himself in the cracked glass; but the reflection did not\nplease him.",
        "“They don’t look ’spectable,” he decided; and, forthwith taking them\noff again, he put on the new suit of the day before.",
        "“I must try to earn a little more,” he thought, “to pay for my room,\nand to buy some new clo’es when these is wore out.”",
        "He opened the door of his chamber, and went downstairs and into the\nstreet, carrying his blacking-box with him.",
        "It was Dick’s custom to commence his business before breakfast;\ngenerally it must be owned, because he began the day penniless, and\nmust earn his meal before he ate it. To-day it was different. He had\nfour dollars left in his pocket-book; but this he had previously\ndetermined not to touch. In fact he had formed the ambitious\ndesign of starting an account at a savings’ bank, in order to\nhave something to fall back upon in case of sickness or any other\nemergency, or at any rate as a reserve fund to expend in clothing or\nother necessary articles when he required them. Hitherto he had been\ncontent to live on from day to day without a penny ahead; but the\nnew vision of respectability which now floated before Dick’s mind,\nowing to his recent acquaintance with Frank, was beginning to\nexercise a powerful effect upon him.",
        "In Dick’s profession as in others there are lucky days, when\neverything seems to flow prosperously. As if to encourage him in\nhis new-born resolution, our hero obtained no less than six jobs\nin the course of an hour and a half. This gave him sixty cents,\nquite abundant to purchase his breakfast, and a comb besides. His\nexertions made him hungry, and, entering a small eating-house he\nordered a cup of coffee and a beefsteak. To this he added a couple\nof rolls. This was quite a luxurious breakfast for Dick, and more\nexpensive than he was accustomed to indulge himself with. To gratify\nthe curiosity of my young readers, I will put down the items with\ntheir cost,–",
        "  Coffee, . . . . . . . . . . . . .  5 cts.\n  Beefsteak, . . . . . . . . . . .  15\n  A couple of rolls,  . . . . . . .  5\n                                  –25 cts.",
        "It will thus be seen that our hero had expended nearly one-half of\nhis morning’s earnings. Some days he had been compelled to breakfast\non five cents, and then he was forced to content himself with\na couple of apples, or cakes. But a good breakfast is a good\npreparation for a busy day, and Dick sallied forth from the\nrestaurant lively and alert, ready to do a good stroke of business.",
        "Dick’s change of costume was liable to lead to one result of which\nhe had not thought. His brother boot-blacks might think he had\ngrown aristocratic, and was putting on airs,–that, in fact, he was\ngetting above his business, and desirous to outshine his associates.\nDick had not dreamed of this, because in fact, in spite of his\nnew-born ambition, he entertained no such feeling. There was\nnothing of what boys call “big-feeling” about him. He was a borough\ndemocrat, using the word not politically, but in its proper sense,\nand was disposed to fraternize with all whom he styled “good\nfellows,” without regard to their position. It may seem a little\nunnecessary to some of my readers to make this explanation; but they\nmust remember that pride and “big-feeling” are confined to no age or\nclass, but may be found in boys as well as men, and in boot-blacks\nas well as those of a higher rank.",
        "The morning being a busy time with the boot-blacks, Dick’s changed\nappearance had not as yet attracted much attention. But when\nbusiness slackened a little, our hero was destined to be reminded\nof it.",
        "Among the down-town boot-blacks was one hailing from the Five\nPoints,–a stout, red-haired, freckled-faced boy of fourteen,\nbearing the name of Micky Maguire. This boy, by his boldness\nand recklessness, as well as by his personal strength, which\nwas considerable, had acquired an ascendancy among his fellow\nprofessionals, and had a gang of subservient followers, whom he led\non to acts of ruffianism, not unfrequently terminating in a month\nor two at Blackwell’s Island. Micky himself had served two terms\nthere; but the confinement appeared to have had very little effect\nin amending his conduct, except, perhaps, in making him a little\nmore cautious about an encounter with the “copps,” as the members\nof the city police are, for some unknown reason, styled among the\nFive-Point boys.",
        "Now Micky was proud of his strength, and of the position of leader\nwhich it had secured him. Moreover he was democratic in his tastes,\nand had a jealous hatred of those who wore good clothes and kept\ntheir faces clean. He called it putting on airs, and resented the\nimplied superiority. If he had been fifteen years older, and had a\ntrifle more education, he would have interested himself in politics,\nand been prominent at ward meetings, and a terror to respectable\nvoters on election day. As it was, he contented himself with being\nthe leader of a gang of young ruffians, over whom he wielded a\ndespotic power.",
        "Now it is only justice to Dick to say that, so far as wearing good\nclothes was concerned, he had never hitherto offended the eyes of\nMicky Maguire. Indeed, they generally looked as if they patronized\nthe same clothing establishment. On this particular morning it\nchanced that Micky had not been very fortunate in a business way,\nand, as a natural consequence, his temper, never very amiable,\nwas somewhat ruffled by the fact. He had had a very frugal\nbreakfast,–not because he felt abstemious, but owing to the low\nstate of his finances. He was walking along with one of his\nparticular friends, a boy nicknamed Limpy Jim, so called from a\nslight peculiarity in his walk, when all at once he espied our\nfriend Dick in his new suit.",
        "“My eyes!” he exclaimed, in astonishment; “Jim, just look at Ragged\nDick. He’s come into a fortun’, and turned gentleman. See his new\nclothes.”",
        "“So he has,” said Jim. “Where’d he get ’em, I wonder?”",
        "“Hooked ’em, p’raps. Let’s go and stir him up a little. We don’t\nwant no gentlemen on our beat. So he’s puttin’ on airs,–is he?\nI’ll give him a lesson.”",
        "So saying the two boys walked up to our hero, who had not observed\nthem, his back being turned, and Micky Maguire gave him a smart slap\non the shoulder.",
        "Dick turned round quickly.",
        "“What’s that for?” demanded Dick, turning round to see who had\nstruck him.",
        "“You’re gettin’ mighty fine!” said Micky Maguire, surveying Dick’s\nnew clothes with a scornful air.",
        "There was something in his words and tone, which Dick, who was\ndisposed to stand up for his dignity, did not at all relish.",
        "“Well, what’s the odds if I am?” he retorted. “Does it hurt you\nany?”",
        "“See him put on airs, Jim,” said Micky, turning to his companion.\n\"Where’d you get them clo’es?”",
        "“Never mind where I got ’em. Maybe the Prince of Wales gave ’em to\nme.”",
        "“Hear him, now, Jim,” said Micky. “Most likely he stole ’em.”",
        "“Stealin’ aint in my line.”",
        "It might have been unconscious the emphasis which Dick placed on the\nword “my.” At any rate Micky chose to take offence.",
        "“Do you mean to say I steal?” he demanded, doubling up his fist,\nand advancing towards Dick in a threatening manner.",
        "“I don’t say anything about it,” answered Dick, by no means alarmed\nat this hostile demonstration. “I know you’ve been to the Island\ntwice. P’r’aps ’twas to make a visit along of the Mayor and\nAldermen. Maybe you was a innocent victim of oppression. I aint a\ngoin’ to say.”",
        "Micky’s freckled face grew red with wrath, for Dick had only stated\nthe truth.",
        "“Do you mean to insult me?” he demanded shaking the fist already\ndoubled up in Dick’s face. “Maybe you want a lickin’?”",
        "“I aint partic’larly anxious to get one,” said Dick, coolly. “They\ndon’t agree with my constitution which is nat’rally delicate. I’d\nrather have a good dinner than a lickin’ any time.”",
        "“You’re afraid,” sneered Micky. “Isn’t he, Jim?”",
        "“In course he is.”",
        "“P’r’aps I am,” said Dick, composedly, “but it don’t trouble\nme much.”",
        "“Do you want to fight?” demanded Micky, encouraged by Dick’s\nquietness, fancying he was afraid to encounter him.",
        "“No, I don’t,” said Dick. “I aint fond of fightin’. It’s a very poor\namusement, and very bad for the complexion, ’specially for the eyes\nand nose, which is apt to turn red, white, and blue.”",
        "Micky misunderstood Dick, and judged from the tenor of his speech\nthat he would be an easy victim. As he knew, Dick very seldom was\nconcerned in any street fight,–not from cowardice, as he imagined,\nbut because he had too much good sense to do so. Being quarrelsome,\nlike all bullies, and supposing that he was more than a match for\nour hero, being about two inches taller, he could no longer resist\nan inclination to assault him, and tried to plant a blow in Dick’s\nface which would have hurt him considerably if he had not drawn back\njust in time.",
        "Now, though Dick was far from quarrelsome, he was ready to defend\nhimself on all occasions, and it was too much to expect that he\nwould stand quiet and allow himself to be beaten.",
        "He dropped his blacking-box on the instant, and returned Micky’s\nblow with such good effect that the young bully staggered back, and\nwould have fallen, if he had not been propped up by his confederate,\nLimpy Jim.",
        "“Go in, Micky!” shouted the latter, who was rather a coward on his\nown account, but liked to see others fight. “Polish him off, that’s\na good feller.”",
        "Micky was now boiling over with rage and fury, and required no\nurging. He was fully determined to make a terrible example of poor\nDick. He threw himself upon him, and strove to bear him to the\nground; but Dick, avoiding a close hug, in which he might possibly\nhave got the worst of it, by an adroit movement, tripped up his\nantagonist, and stretched him on the side walk.",
        "“Hit him, Jim!” exclaimed Micky, furiously.",
        "Limpy Jim did not seem inclined to obey orders. There was a quiet\nstrength and coolness about Dick, which alarmed him. He preferred\nthat Micky should incur all the risks of battle, and accordingly set\nhimself to raising his fallen comrade.",
        "“Come, Micky,” said Dick, quietly, “you’d better give it up. I\nwouldn’t have touched you if you hadn’t hit me first. I don’t want\nto fight. It’s low business.”",
        "“You’re afraid of hurtin’ your clo’es,” said Micky, with a sneer.",
        "“Maybe I am,” said Dick. “I hope I haven’t hurt yours.”",
        "Micky’s answer to this was another attack, as violent and impetuous\nas the first. But his fury was in the way. He struck wildly, not\nmeasuring his blows, and Dick had no difficulty in turning aside, so\nthat his antagonist’s blow fell upon the empty air, and his momentum\nwas such that he nearly fell forward headlong. Dick might readily\nhave taken advantage of his unsteadiness, and knocked him down; but\nhe was not vindictive, and chose to act on the defensive, except\nwhen he could not avoid it.",
        "Recovering himself, Micky saw that Dick was a more formidable\nantagonist than he had supposed, and was meditating another assault,\nbetter planned, which by its impetuosity might bear our hero to the\nground. But there was an unlooked-for interference.",
        "“Look out for the ’copp,’” said Jim, in a low voice.",
        "Micky turned round and saw a tall policeman heading towards him, and\nthought it might be prudent to suspend hostilities. He accordingly\npicked up his black-box, and, hitching up his pants, walked off,\nattended by Limpy Jim.",
        "“What’s that chap been doing?” asked the policeman of Dick.",
        "“He was amoosin’ himself by pitchin’ into me,” replied Dick.",
        "“What for?”",
        "“He didn’t like it ’cause I patronized a different tailor from him.”",
        "“Well, it seems to me you are dressed pretty smart for a\nboot-black,” said the policeman.",
        "“I wish I wasn’t a boot-black,” said Dick.",
        "“Never mind, my lad. It’s an honest business,” said the policeman,\nwho was a sensible man and a worthy citizen. “It’s an honest\nbusiness. Stick to it till you get something better.”",
        "“I mean to,” said Dick. “It aint easy to get out of it, as the\nprisoner remarked, when he was asked how he liked his residence.”",
        "“I hope you don’t speak from experience.”",
        "“No,” said Dick; “I don’t mean to get into prison if I can\nhelp it.”",
        "“Do you see that gentleman over there?” asked the officer, pointing\nto a well-dressed man who was walking on the other side of the\nstreet.",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Well, he was once a newsboy.”",
        "“And what is he now?”",
        "“He keeps a bookstore, and is quite prosperous.”",
        "Dick looked at the gentleman with interest, wondering if he should\nlook as respectable when he was a grown man.",
        "It will be seen that Dick was getting ambitious. Hitherto he had\nthought very little of the future, but was content to get along as\nhe could, dining as well as his means would allow, and spending the\nevenings in the pit of the Old Bowery, eating peanuts between the\nacts if he was prosperous, and if unlucky supping on dry bread or\nan apple, and sleeping in an old box or a wagon. Now, for the first\ntime, he began to reflect that he could not black boots all his\nlife. In seven years he would be a man, and, since his meeting with\nFrank, he felt that he would like to be a respectable man. He could\nsee and appreciate the difference between Frank and such a boy as\nMicky Maguire, and it was not strange that he preferred the society\nof the former.",
        "In the course of the next morning, in pursuance of his new\nresolutions for the future, he called at a savings bank, and held\nout four dollars in bills besides another dollar in change. There\nwas a high railing, and a number of clerks busily writing at desks\nbehind it. Dick, never having been in a bank before, did not know\nwhere to go. He went, by mistake, to the desk where money was paid\nout.",
        "“Where’s your book?” asked the clerk.",
        "“I haven’t got any.”",
        "“Have you any money deposited here?”",
        "“No, sir, I want to leave some here.”",
        "“Then go to the next desk.”",
        "Dick followed directions, and presented himself before an elderly\nman with gray hair, who looked at him over the rims of his\nspectacles.",
        "“I want you to keep that for me,” said Dick, awkwardly emptying his\nmoney out on the desk.",
        "“How much is there?”",
        "“Five dollars.”",
        "“Have you got an account here?”",
        "“No, sir.”",
        "“Of course you can write?”",
        "The “of course” was said on account of Dick’s neat dress.",
        "“Have I got to do any writing?” asked our hero, a little\nembarrassed.",
        "“We want you to sign your name in this book,” and the old gentleman\nshoved round a large folio volume containing the names of\ndepositors.",
        "Dick surveyed the book with some awe.",
        "“I aint much on writin’,” he said.",
        "“Very well; write as well as you can.”",
        "The pen was put into Dick’s hand, and, after dipping it in the\ninkstand, he succeeded after a hard effort, accompanied by many\ncontortions of the face, in inscribing upon the book of the bank\nthe name",
        "“Dick!–that means Richard, I suppose,” said the bank officer, who\nhad some difficulty in making out the signature.",
        "“No; Ragged Dick is what folks call me.”",
        "“You don’t look very ragged.”",
        "“No, I’ve left my rags to home. They might get wore out if I used\n’em too common.”",
        "“Well, my lad, I’ll make out a book in the name of Dick Hunter,\nsince you seem to prefer Dick to Richard. I hope you will save up\nyour money and deposit more with us.”",
        "Our hero took his bank-book, and gazed on the entry “Five Dollars\"\nwith a new sense of importance. He had been accustomed to joke\nabout Erie shares, but now, for the first time, he felt himself a\ncapitalist; on a small scale, to be sure, but still it was no small\nthing for Dick to have five dollars which he could call his own. He\nfirmly determined that he would lay by every cent he could spare\nfrom his earnings towards the fund he hoped to accumulate.",
        "But Dick was too sensible not to know that there was something more\nthan money needed to win a respectable position in the world. He\nfelt that he was very ignorant. Of reading and writing he only knew\nthe rudiments, and that, with a slight acquaintance with arithmetic,\nwas all he did know of books. Dick knew he must study hard, and\nhe dreaded it. He looked upon learning as attended with greater\ndifficulties than it really possesses. But Dick had good pluck. He\nmeant to learn, nevertheless, and resolved to buy a book with his\nfirst spare earnings.",
        "When Dick went home at night he locked up his bank-book in one\nof the drawers of the bureau. It was wonderful how much more\nindependent he felt whenever he reflected upon the contents of\nthat drawer, and with what an important air of joint ownership\nhe regarded the bank building in which his small savings were\ndeposited.",
        "The next morning Dick was unusually successful, having plenty to do,\nand receiving for one job twenty-five cents,–the gentleman refusing\nto take change. Then flashed upon Dick’s mind the thought that he\nhad not yet returned the change due to the gentleman whose boots he\nhad blacked on the morning of his introduction to the reader.",
        "“What’ll he think of me?” said Dick to himself. “I hope he won’t\nthink I’m mean enough to keep the money.”",
        "Now Dick was scrupulously honest, and though the temptation to be\notherwise had often been strong, he had always resisted it. He was\nnot willing on any account to keep money which did not belong to\nhim, and he immediately started for 125 Fulton Street (the address\nwhich had been given him) where he found Mr. Greyson’s name on the\ndoor of an office on the first floor.",
        "The door being open, Dick walked in.",
        "“Is Mr. Greyson in?” he asked of a clerk who sat on a high stool\nbefore a desk.",
        "“Not just now. He’ll be in soon. Will you wait?”",
        "“Yes,” said Dick.",
        "“Very well; take a seat then.”",
        "Dick sat down and took up the morning “Tribune,” but presently\ncame to a word of four syllables, which he pronounced to himself a\n\"sticker,” and laid it down. But he had not long to wait, for five\nminutes later Mr. Greyson entered.",
        "“Did you wish to speak to me, my lad?” said he to Dick, whom in his\nnew clothes he did not recognize.",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Dick. “I owe you some money.”",
        "“Indeed!” said Mr. Greyson, pleasantly; “that’s an agreeable\nsurprise. I didn’t know but you had come for some. So you are\na debtor of mine, and not a creditor?”",
        "“I b’lieve that’s right,” said Dick, drawing fifteen cents from his\npocket, and placing in Mr. Greyson’s hand.",
        "“Fifteen cents!” repeated he, in some surprise. “How do you happen\nto be indebted to me in that amount?”",
        "“You gave me a quarter for a-shinin’ your boots, yesterday mornin’,\nand couldn’t wait for the change. I meant to have brought it before,\nbut I forgot all about it till this mornin’.”",
        "“It had quite slipped my mind also. But you don’t look like the boy\nI employed. If I remember rightly he wasn’t as well dressed as you.”",
        "“No,” said Dick. “I was dressed for a party, then, but the clo’es\nwas too well ventilated to be comfortable in cold weather.”",
        "“You’re an honest boy,” said Mr. Greyson. “Who taught you to be\nhonest?”",
        "“Nobody,” said Dick. “But it’s mean to cheat and steal. I’ve always\nknowed that.”",
        "“Then you’ve got ahead of some of our business men. Do you read\nthe Bible?”",
        "“No,” said Dick. “I’ve heard it’s a good book, but I don’t know much\nabout it.”",
        "“You ought to go to some Sunday School. Would you be willing?”",
        "“Yes,” said Dick, promptly. “I want to grow up ’spectable. But I\ndon’t know where to go.”",
        "“Then I’ll tell you. The church I attend is at the corner of Fifth\nAvenue and Twenty-first Street.”",
        "“I’ve seen it,” said Dick.",
        "“I have a class in the Sunday School there. If you’ll come next\nSunday, I’ll take you into my class, and do what I can to help you.”",
        "“Thank you,” said Dick, “but p’r’aps you’ll get tired of teaching\nme. I’m awful ignorant.”",
        "“No, my lad,” said Mr. Greyson, kindly. “You evidently have some\ngood principles to start with, as you have shown by your scorn of\ndishonesty. I shall hope good things of you in the future.”",
        "“Well, Dick,” said our hero, apostrophizing himself, as he left the\noffice; “you’re gettin’ up in the world. You’ve got money invested,\nand are goin’ to attend church, by partic’lar invitation, on Fifth\nAvenue. I shouldn’t wonder much if you should find cards, when you\nget home, from the Mayor, requestin’ the honor of your company to\ndinner, along with other distinguished guests.”",
        "Dick felt in very good spirits. He seemed to be emerging from the\nworld in which he had hitherto lived, into a new atmosphere of\nrespectability, and the change seemed very pleasant to him.",
        "At six o’clock Dick went into a restaurant on Chatham Street, and\ngot a comfortable supper. He had been so successful during the day\nthat, after paying for this, he still had ninety cents left. While\nhe was despatching his supper, another boy came in, smaller and\nslighter than Dick, and sat down beside him. Dick recognized him\nas a boy who three months before had entered the ranks of the\nboot-blacks, but who, from a natural timidity, had not been able\nto earn much. He was ill-fitted for the coarse companionship of\nthe street boys, and shrank from the rude jokes of his present\nassociates. Dick had never troubled him; for our hero had a certain\nchivalrous feeling which would not allow him to bully or disturb a\nyounger and weaker boy than himself.",
        "“How are you, Fosdick?” said Dick, as the other seated himself.",
        "“Pretty well,” said Fosdick. “I suppose you’re all right.”",
        "“Oh, yes, I’m right side up with care. I’ve been havin’ a bully\nsupper. What are you goin’ to have?”",
        "“Some bread and butter.”",
        "“Why don’t you get a cup o’ coffee?”",
        "“Why,” said Fosdick, reluctantly, “I haven’t got money enough\nto-night.”",
        "“Never mind,” said Dick; “I’m in luck to-day, I’ll stand treat.”",
        "“That’s kind in you,” said Fosdick, gratefully.",
        "“Oh, never mind that,” said Dick.",
        "Accordingly he ordered a cup of coffee, and a plate of beefsteak,\nand was gratified to see that his young companion partook of both\nwith evident relish. When the repast was over, the boys went out\ninto the street together, Dick pausing at the desk to settle for\nboth suppers.",
        "“Where are you going to sleep to-night, Fosdick?” asked Dick, as\nthey stood on the sidewalk.",
        "“I don’t know,” said Fosdick, a little sadly. “In some doorway, I\nexpect. But I’m afraid the police will find me out, and make me\nmove on.”",
        "“I’ll tell you what,” said Dick, “you must go home with me. I guess\nmy bed will hold two.”",
        "“Have you got a room?” asked the other, in surprise.",
        "“Yes,” said Dick, rather proudly, and with a little excusable\nexultation. “I’ve got a room over in Mott Street; there I can\nreceive my friends. That’ll be better than sleepin’ in a\ndoor-way,–won’t it?”",
        "“Yes, indeed it will,” said Fosdick. “How lucky I was to come across\nyou! It comes hard to me living as I do. When my father was alive I\nhad every comfort.”",
        "“That’s more’n I ever had,” said Dick. “But I’m goin’ to try to live\ncomfortable now. Is your father dead?”",
        "“Yes,” said Fosdick, sadly. “He was a printer; but he was drowned\none dark night from a Fulton ferry-boat, and, as I had no relations\nin the city, and no money, I was obliged to go to work as quick as\nI could. But I don’t get on very well.”",
        "“Didn’t you have no brothers nor sisters?” asked Dick.",
        "“No,” said Fosdick; “father and I used to live alone. He was always\nso much company to me that I feel very lonesome without him. There’s\na man out West somewhere that owes him two thousand dollars. He used\nto live in the city, and father lent him all his money to help him\ngo into business; but he failed, or pretended to, and went off. If\nfather hadn’t lost that money he would have left me well off; but no\nmoney would have made up his loss to me.”",
        "“What’s the man’s name that went off with your father’s money?”",
        "“His name is Hiram Bates.”",
        "“P’r’aps you’ll get the money again, sometime.”",
        "“There isn’t much chance of it,” said Fosdick. “I’d sell out my\nchances of that for five dollars.”",
        "“Maybe I’ll buy you out sometime,” said Dick. “Now, come round and\nsee what sort of a room I’ve got. I used to go to the theatre\nevenings, when I had money; but now I’d rather go to bed early, and\nhave a good sleep.”",
        "“I don’t care much about theatres,” said Fosdick. “Father didn’t use\nto let me go very often. He said it wasn’t good for boys.”",
        "“I like to go to the Old Bowery sometimes. They have tip-top plays\nthere. Can you read and write well?” he asked, as a sudden thought\ncame to him.",
        "“Yes,” said Fosdick. “Father always kept me at school when he was\nalive, and I stood pretty well in my classes. I was expecting to\nenter at the Free Academy* next year.”",
        "* Now the college of the city of New York.",
        "“Then I’ll tell you what,” said Dick; “I’ll make a bargain with you.\nI can’t read much more’n a pig; and my writin’ looks like hens’\ntracks. I don’t want to grow up knowin’ no more’n a four-year-old\nboy. If you’ll teach me readin’ and writin’ evenin’s, you shall\nsleep in my room every night. That’ll be better’n door-steps or old\nboxes, where I’ve slept many a time.”",
        "“Are you in earnest?” said Fosdick, his face lighting up hopefully.",
        "“In course I am,” said Dick. “It’s fashionable for young gentlemen\nto have private tootors to introduct ’em into the flower-beds of\nliteratoor and science, and why shouldn’t I foller the fashion? You\nshall be my perfessor; only you must promise not to be very hard if\nmy writin’ looks like a rail-fence on a bender.”",
        "“I’ll try not to be too severe,” said Fosdick, laughing. “I shall be\nthankful for such a chance to get a place to sleep. Have you got\nanything to read out of?”",
        "“No,” said Dick. “My extensive and well-selected library was lost\noverboard in a storm, when I was sailin’ from the Sandwich Islands\nto the desert of Sahara. But I’ll buy a paper. That’ll do me a\nlong time.”",
        "Accordingly Dick stopped at a paper-stand, and bought a copy of\na weekly paper, filled with the usual variety of reading\nmatter,–stories, sketches, poems, etc.",
        "They soon arrived at Dick’s lodging-house. Our hero, procuring a\nlamp from the landlady, led the way into his apartment, which he\nentered with the proud air of a proprietor.",
        "“Well, how do you like it, Fosdick?” he asked, complacently.",
        "The time was when Fosdick would have thought it untidy and not\nparticularly attractive. But he had served a severe apprenticeship\nin the streets, and it was pleasant to feel himself under shelter,\nand he was not disposed to be critical.",
        "“It looks very comfortable, Dick,” he said.",
        "“The bed aint very large,” said Dick; “but I guess we can\nget along.”",
        "“Oh, yes,” said Fosdick, cheerfully. “I don’t take up much room.”",
        "“Then that’s all right. There’s two chairs, you see, one for you\nand one for me. In case the mayor comes in to spend the evenin’\nsocially, he can sit on the bed.”",
        "The boys seated themselves, and five minutes later, under the\nguidance of his young tutor, Dick had commenced his studies.",
        "Fortunately for Dick, his young tutor was well qualified to instruct\nhim. Henry Fosdick, though only twelve years old, knew as much as\nmany boys of fourteen. He had always been studious and ambitious\nto excel. His father, being a printer, employed in an office where\nbooks were printed, often brought home new books in sheets, which\nHenry was always glad to read. Mr. Fosdick had been, besides, a\nsubscriber to the Mechanics’ Apprentices’ Library, which contains\nmany thousands of well-selected and instructive books. Thus Henry\nhad acquired an amount of general information, unusual in a boy of\nhis age. Perhaps he had devoted too much time to study, for he was\nnot naturally robust. All this, however, fitted him admirably for\nthe office to which Dick had appointed him,–that of his private\ninstructor.",
        "The two boys drew up their chairs to the rickety table, and spread\nout the paper before them.",
        "“The exercises generally Commence with ringin’ the bell,” said Dick;\n\"but as I aint got none, we’ll have to do without.”",
        "“And the teacher is generally provided with a rod,” said Fosdick.\n\"Isn’t there a poker handy, that I can use in case my scholar\ndoesn’t behave well?”",
        "“’Taint lawful to use fire-arms,” said Dick.",
        "“Now, Dick,” said Fosdick, “before we begin, I must find out how\nmuch you already know. Can you read any?”",
        "“Not enough to hurt me,” said Dick. “All I know about readin’ you\ncould put in a nutshell, and there’d be room left for a small\nfamily.”",
        "“I suppose you know your letters?”",
        "“Yes,” said Dick, “I know ’em all, but not intimately. I guess I can\ncall ’em all by name.”",
        "“Where did you learn them? Did you ever go to school?”",
        "“Yes; I went two days.”",
        "“Why did you stop?”",
        "“It didn’t agree with my constitution.”",
        "“You don’t look very delicate,” said Fosdick.",
        "“No,” said Dick, “I aint troubled much that way; but I found lickins\ndidn’t agree with me.”",
        "“Did you get punished?”",
        "“Awful,” said Dick.",
        "“What for?”",
        "“For indulgin’ in a little harmless amoosement,” said Dick. “You see\nthe boy that was sittin’ next to me fell asleep, which I considered\nimproper in school-time; so I thought I’d help the teacher a little\nby wakin’ him up. So I took a pin and stuck into him; but I guess it\nwent a little too far, for he screeched awful. The teacher found out\nwhat it was that made him holler, and whipped me with a ruler till I\nwas black and blue. I thought ’twas about time to take a vacation;\nso that’s the last time I went to school.”",
        "“You didn’t learn to read in that time, of course?”",
        "“No,” said Dick; “but I was a newsboy a little while; so I learned a\nlittle, just so’s to find out what the news was. Sometimes I didn’t\nread straight and called the wrong news. One mornin’ I asked another\nboy what the paper said, and he told me the King of Africa was dead.\nI thought it was all right till folks began to laugh.”",
        "“Well, Dick, if you’ll only study well, you won’t be liable to make\nsuch mistakes.”",
        "“I hope so,” said Dick. “My friend Horace Greeley told me the other\nday that he’d get me to take his place now and then when he was off\nmakin’ speeches if my edication hadn’t been neglected.”",
        "“I must find a good piece for you to begin on,” said Fosdick,\nlooking over the paper.",
        "“Find an easy one,” said Dick, “with words of one story.”",
        "Fosdick at length found a piece which he thought would answer. He\ndiscovered on trial that Dick had not exaggerated his deficiencies.\nWords of two syllables he seldom pronounced right, and was much\nsurprised when he was told how “through” was sounded.",
        "“Seems to me it’s throwin’ away letters to use all them,” he said.",
        "“How would you spell it?” asked his young teacher.",
        "“T-h-r-u,” Said Dick.",
        "“Well,” said Fosdick, “there’s a good many other words that are\nspelt with more letters than they need to have. But it’s the\nfashion, and we must follow it.”",
        "But if Dick was ignorant, he was quick, and had an excellent\ncapacity. Moreover he had perseverance, and was not easily\ndiscouraged. He had made up his mind he must know more, and was\nnot disposed to complain of the difficulty of his task. Fosdick\nhad occasion to laugh more than once at his ludicrous mistakes; but\nDick laughed too, and on the whole both were quite interested in\nthe lesson.",
        "At the end of an hour and a half the boys stopped for the evening.",
        "“You’re learning fast, Dick,” said Fosdick. “At this rate you will\nsoon learn to read well.”",
        "“Will I?” asked Dick with an expression of satisfaction. “I’m glad\nof that. I don’t want to be ignorant. I didn’t use to care, but I do\nnow. I want to grow up ’spectable.”",
        "“So do I, Dick. We will both help each other, and I am sure we can\naccomplish something. But I am beginning to feel sleepy.”",
        "“So am I,” said Dick. “Them hard words make my head ache. I wonder\nwho made ’em all?”",
        "“That’s more than I can tell. I suppose you’ve seen a dictionary.”",
        "“That’s another of ’em. No, I can’t say I have, though I may have\nseen him in the street without knowin’ him.”",
        "“A dictionary is a book containing all the words in the language.”",
        "“How many are there?”",
        "“I don’t rightly know; but I think there are about fifty thousand.”",
        "“It’s a pretty large family,” said Dick. “Have I got to learn ’em\nall?”",
        "“That will not be necessary. There are a large number which you\nwould never find occasion to use.”",
        "“I’m glad of that,” said Dick; “for I don’t expect to live to be\nmore’n a hundred, and by that time I wouldn’t be more’n half\nthrough.”",
        "By this time the flickering lamp gave a decided hint to the boys\nthat unless they made haste they would have to undress in the dark.\nThey accordingly drew off their clothes, and Dick jumped into bed.\nBut Fosdick, before doing so, knelt down by the side of the bed, and\nsaid a short prayer.",
        "“What’s that for?” asked Dick, curiously.",
        "“I was saying my prayers,” said Fosdick, as he rose from his knees.\n\"Don’t you ever do it?”",
        "“No,” said Dick. “Nobody ever taught me.”",
        "“Then I’ll teach you. Shall I?”",
        "“I don’t know,” said Dick, dubiously. “What’s the good?”",
        "Fosdick explained as well as he could, and perhaps his simple\nexplanation was better adapted to Dick’s comprehension than one\nfrom an older person would have been. Dick felt more free to ask\nquestions, and the example of his new friend, for whom he was\nbeginning to feel a warm attachment, had considerable effect upon\nhim. When, therefore, Fosdick asked again if he should teach him a\nprayer, Dick consented, and his young bedfellow did so. Dick was not\nnaturally irreligious. If he had lived without a knowledge of God\nand of religious things, it was scarcely to be wondered at in a lad\nwho, from an early age, had been thrown upon his own exertions for\nthe means of living, with no one to care for him or give him good\nadvice. But he was so far good that he could appreciate goodness in\nothers, and this it was that had drawn him to Frank in the first\nplace, and now to Henry Fosdick. He did not, therefore, attempt to\nridicule his companion, as some boys better brought up might have\ndone, but was willing to follow his example in what something told\nhim was right. Our young hero had taken an important step toward\nsecuring that genuine respectability which he was ambitious to\nattain.",
        "Weary with the day’s work, and Dick perhaps still more fatigued by\nthe unusual mental effort he had made, the boys soon sank into a\ndeep and peaceful slumber, from which they did not awaken till six\no’clock the next morning. Before going out Dick sought Mrs. Mooney,\nand spoke to her on the subject of taking Fosdick as a room-mate.\nHe found that she had no objection, provided he would allow her\ntwenty-five cents a week extra, in consideration of the extra\ntrouble which his companion might be expected to make. To this\nDick assented, and the arrangement was definitely concluded.",
        "This over, the two boys went out and took stations near each other.\nDick had more of a business turn than Henry, and less shrinking from\npublicity, so that his earnings were greater. But he had undertaken\nto pay the entire expenses of the room, and needed to earn more.\nSometimes, when two customers presented themselves at the same time,\nhe was able to direct one to his friend. So at the end of the week\nboth boys found themselves with surplus earnings. Dick had the\nsatisfaction of adding two dollars and a half to his deposits in\nthe Savings Bank, and Fosdick commenced an account by depositing\nseventy-five cents.",
        "On Sunday morning Dick bethought himself of his promise to Mr.\nGreyson to come to the church on Fifth Avenue. To tell the truth,\nDick recalled it with some regret. He had never been inside a church\nsince he could remember, and he was not much attracted by the\ninvitation he had received. But Henry, finding him wavering, urged\nhim to go, and offered to go with him. Dick gladly accepted the\noffer, feeling that he required someone to lend him countenance\nunder such unusual circumstances.",
        "Dick dressed himself with scrupulous care, giving his shoes a\n\"shine” so brilliant that it did him great credit in a professional\npoint of view, and endeavored to clean his hands thoroughly; but, in\nspite of all he could do, they were not so white as if his business\nhad been of a different character.",
        "Having fully completed his preparations, he descended into the\nstreet, and, with Henry by his side, crossed over to Broadway.",
        "The boys pursued their way up Broadway, which on Sunday presents\na striking contrast in its quietness to the noise and confusion\nof ordinary week-days, as far as Union Square, then turned down\nFourteenth Street, which brought them to Fifth Avenue.",
        "“Suppose we dine at Delmonico’s,” said Fosdick, looking towards that\nfamous restaurant.",
        "“I’d have to sell some of my Erie shares,” said Dick.",
        "A short walk now brought them to the church of which mention has\nalready been made. They stood outside, a little abashed, watching\nthe fashionably attired people who were entering, and were feeling\na little undecided as to whether they had better enter also, when\nDick felt a light touch upon his shoulder.",
        "Turning round, he met the smiling glance of Mr. Greyson.",
        "“So, my young friend, you have kept your promise,” he said. “And\nwhom have you brought with you?”",
        "“A friend of mine,” said Dick. “His name is Henry Fosdick.”",
        "“I am glad you have brought him. Now follow me, and I will give you\nseats.”",
        "It was the hour for morning service. The boys followed Mr. Greyson\ninto the handsome church, and were assigned seats in his own pew.",
        "There were two persons already seated in it,–a good-looking lady of\nmiddle age, and a pretty little girl of nine. They were Mrs. Greyson\nand her only daughter Ida. They looked pleasantly at the boys as\nthey entered, smiling a welcome to them.",
        "The morning service commenced. It must be acknowledged that Dick\nfelt rather awkward. It was an unusual place for him, and it need\nnot be wondered at that he felt like a cat in a strange garret. He\nwould not have known when to rise if he had not taken notice of what\nthe rest of the audience did, and followed their example. He was\nsitting next to Ida, and as it was the first time he had ever been\nnear so well-dressed a young lady, he naturally felt bashful. When\nthe hymns were announced, Ida found the place, and offered a\nhymn-book to our hero. Dick took it awkwardly, but his studies had\nnot yet been pursued far enough for him to read the words readily.\nHowever, he resolved to keep up appearances, and kept his eyes\nfixed steadily on the hymn-book.",
        "At length the service was over. The people began to file slowly out\nof church, and among them, of course, Mr. Greyson’s family and the\ntwo boys. It seemed very strange to Dick to find himself in such\ndifferent companionship from what he had been accustomed, and he\ncould not help thinking, “Wonder what Johnny Nolan ’ould say if he\ncould see me now!”",
        "But Johnny’s business engagements did not often summon him to Fifth\nAvenue, and Dick was not likely to be seen by any of his friends in\nthe lower part of the city.",
        "“We have our Sunday school in the afternoon,” said Mr. Greyson. “I\nsuppose you live at some distance from here?”",
        "“In Mott Street, sir,” answered Dick.",
        "“That is too far to go and return. Suppose you and your friend\ncome and dine with us, and then we can come here together in the\nafternoon.”",
        "Dick was as much astonished at this invitation as if he had really\nbeen invited by the Mayor to dine with him and the Board of\nAldermen. Mr. Greyson was evidently a rich man, and yet he had\nactually invited two boot-blacks to dine with him.",
        "“I guess we’d better go home, sir,” said Dick, hesitating.",
        "“I don’t think you can have any very pressing engagements to\ninterfere with your accepting my invitation,” said Mr. Greyson,\ngood-humoredly, for he understood the reason of Dick’s hesitation.\n\"So I take it for granted that you both accept.”",
        "Before Dick fairly knew what he intended to do, he was walking down\nFifth Avenue with his new friends.",
        "Now, our young hero was not naturally bashful; but he certainly felt\nso now, especially as Miss Ida Greyson chose to walk by his side,\nleaving Henry Fosdick to walk with her father and mother.",
        "“What is your name?” asked Ida, pleasantly.",
        "Our hero was about to answer “Ragged Dick,” when it occurred to him\nthat in the present company he had better forget his old nickname.",
        "“Dick Hunter,” he answered.",
        "“Dick!” repeated Ida. “That means Richard, doesn’t it?”",
        "“Everybody calls me Dick.”",
        "“I have a cousin Dick,” said the young lady, sociably. “His name is\nDick Wilson. I suppose you don’t know him?”",
        "“No,” said Dick.",
        "“I like the name of Dick,” said the young lady, with charming\nfrankness.",
        "Without being able to tell why, Dick felt rather glad she did. He\nplucked up courage to ask her name.",
        "“My name is Ida,” answered the young lady. “Do you like it?”",
        "“Yes,” said Dick. “It’s a bully name.”",
        "Dick turned red as soon as he had said it, for he felt that he had\nnot used the right expression.",
        "The little girl broke into a silvery laugh.",
        "“What a funny boy you are!” she said.",
        "“I didn’t mean it,” said Dick, stammering. “I meant it’s a tip-top\nname.”",
        "Here Ida laughed again, and Dick wished himself back in Mott Street.",
        "“How old are you?” inquired Ida, continuing her examination.",
        "“I’m fourteen,–goin’ on fifteen,” said Dick.",
        "“You’re a big boy of your age,” said Ida. “My cousin Dick is a year\nolder than you, but he isn’t as large.”",
        "Dick looked pleased. Boys generally like to be told that they are\nlarge of their age.",
        "“How old be you?” asked Dick, beginning to feel more at his ease.",
        "“I’m nine years old,” said Ida. “I go to Miss Jarvis’s school. I’ve\njust begun to learn French. Do you know French?”",
        "“Not enough to hurt me,” said Dick.",
        "Ida laughed again, and told him that he was a droll boy.",
        "“Do you like it?” asked Dick.",
        "“I like it pretty well, except the verbs. I can’t remember them\nwell. Do you go to school?”",
        "“I’m studying with a private tutor,” said Dick.",
        "“Are you? So is my cousin Dick. He’s going to college this year. Are\nyou going to college?”",
        "“Not this year.”",
        "“Because, if you did, you know you’d be in the same class with my\ncousin. It would be funny to have two Dicks in one class.”",
        "They turned down Twenty-fourth Street, passing the Fifth Avenue\nHotel on the left, and stopped before an elegant house with a brown\nstone front. The bell was rung, and the door being opened, the boys,\nsomewhat abashed, followed Mr. Greyson into a handsome hall. They\nwere told where to hang their hats, and a moment afterwards were\nushered into a comfortable dining-room, where a table was spread\nfor dinner.",
        "Dick took his seat on the edge of a sofa, and was tempted to rub his\neyes to make sure that he was really awake. He could hardly believe\nthat he was a guest in so fine a mansion.",
        "Ida helped to put the boys at their ease.",
        "“Do you like pictures?” she asked.",
        "“Very much,” answered Henry.",
        "The little girl brought a book of handsome engravings, and, seating\nherself beside Dick, to whom she seemed to have taken a decided\nfancy, commenced showing them to him.",
        "“There are the Pyramids of Egypt,” she said, pointing to one engraving.",
        "“What are they for?” asked Dick, puzzled. “I don’t see any winders.”",
        "“No,” said Ida, “I don’t believe anybody lives there. Do they, papa?”",
        "“No, my dear. They were used for the burial of the dead. The largest\nof them is said to be the loftiest building in the world with one\nexception. The spire of the Cathedral of Strasburg is twenty-four\nfeet higher, if I remember rightly.”",
        "“Is Egypt near here?” asked Dick.",
        "“Oh, no, it’s ever so many miles off; about four or five hundred.\nDidn’t you know?”",
        "“No,” said Dick. “I never heard.”",
        "“You don’t appear to be very accurate in your information, Ida,\"\nsaid her mother. “Four or five thousand miles would be considerably\nnearer the truth.”",
        "After a little more conversation they sat down to dinner. Dick\nseated himself in an embarrassed way. He was very much afraid of\ndoing or saying something which would be considered an impropriety,\nand had the uncomfortable feeling that everybody was looking at him,\nand watching his behavior.",
        "“Where do you live, Dick?” asked Ida, familiarly.",
        "“In Mott Street.”",
        "“Where is that?”",
        "“More than a mile off.”",
        "“Is it a nice street?”",
        "“Not very,” said Dick. “Only poor folks live there.”",
        "“Are you poor?”",
        "“Little girls should be seen and not heard,” said her mother, gently.",
        "“If you are,” said Ida, “I’ll give you the five-dollar gold-piece\naunt gave me for a birthday present.”",
        "“Dick cannot be called poor, my child,” said Mrs. Greyson, “since he\nearns his living by his own exertions.”",
        "“Do you earn your living?” asked Ida, who was a very inquisitive\nyoung lady, and not easily silenced. “What do you do?”",
        "Dick blushed violently. At such a table, and in presence of the\nservant who was standing at that moment behind his chair, he did not\nlike to say that he was a shoe-black, although he well knew that\nthere was nothing dishonorable in the occupation.",
        "Mr. Greyson perceived his feelings, and to spare them, said, “You\nare too inquisitive, Ida. Sometime Dick may tell you, but you know\nwe don’t talk of business on Sundays.”",
        "Dick in his embarrassment had swallowed a large spoonful of hot\nsoup, which made him turn red in the face. For the second time,\nin spite of the prospect of the best dinner he had ever eaten, he\nwished himself back in Mott Street. Henry Fosdick was more easy\nand unembarrassed than Dick, not having led such a vagabond and\nneglected life. But it was to Dick that Ida chiefly directed her\nconversation, having apparently taken a fancy to his frank and\nhandsome face. I believe I have already said that Dick was a very\ngood-looking boy, especially now since he kept his face clean. He\nhad a frank, honest expression, which generally won its way to the\nfavor of those with whom he came in contact.",
        "Dick got along pretty well at the table by dint of noticing how the\nrest acted, but there was one thing he could not manage, eating with\nhis fork, which, by the way, he thought a very singular arrangement.",
        "At length they arose from the table, somewhat to Dick’s relief.\nAgain Ida devoted herself to the boys, and exhibited a profusely\nillustrated Bible for their entertainment. Dick was interested in\nlooking at the pictures, though he knew very little of their\nsubjects. Henry Fosdick was much better informed, as might have\nbeen expected.",
        "When the boys were about to leave the house with Mr. Greyson for the\nSunday school, Ida placed her hand in Dick’s, and said persuasively.\n\"You’ll come again, Dick, won’t you?”",
        "“Thank you,” said Dick, “I’d like to,” and he could not help\nthinking Ida the nicest girl he had ever seen.",
        "“Yes,” said Mrs. Greyson, hospitably, “we shall be glad to see you\nboth here again.”",
        "“Thank you very much,” said Henry Fosdick, gratefully. “We shall\nlike very much to come.”",
        "I will not dwell upon the hour spent in Sunday school, nor upon the\nremarks of Mr. Greyson to his class. He found Dick’s ignorance of\nreligious subjects so great that he was obliged to begin at the\nbeginning with him. Dick was interested in hearing the children\nsing, and readily promised to come again the next Sunday.",
        "When the service was over Dick and Henry walked homewards. Dick\ncould not help letting his thoughts rest on the sweet little girl\nwho had given him so cordial a welcome, and hoping that he might\nmeet her again.",
        "“Mr. Greyson is a nice man,–isn’t he, Dick?” asked Henry, as they\nwere turning into Mott Street, and were already in sight of their\nlodging-house.",
        "“Aint he, though?” said Dick. “He treated us just as if we were\nyoung gentlemen.”",
        "“Ida seemed to take a great fancy to you.”",
        "“She’s a tip-top girl,” said Dick, “but she asked so many questions\nthat I didn’t know what to say.”",
        "He had scarcely finished speaking, when a stone whizzed by his head,\nand, turning quickly, he saw Micky Maguire running round the corner\nof the street which they had just passed.",
        "Dick was no coward. Nor was he in the habit of submitting passively\nto an insult. When, therefore, he recognized Micky as his assailant,\nhe instantly turned and gave chase. Micky anticipated pursuit, and\nran at his utmost speed. It is doubtful if Dick would have overtaken\nhim, but Micky had the ill luck to trip just as he had entered a\nnarrow alley, and, falling with some violence, received a sharp blow\nfrom the hard stones, which made him scream with pain.",
        "“Ow!” he whined. “Don’t you hit a feller when he’s down.”",
        "“What made you fire that stone at me?” demanded our hero, looking\ndown at the fallen bully.",
        "“Just for fun,” said Micky.",
        "“It would have been a very agreeable s’prise if it had hit me,” said\nDick. “S’posin’ I fire a rock at you jest for fun.”",
        "“Don’t!” exclaimed Micky, in alarm.",
        "“It seems you don’t like agreeable s’prises,” said Dick, “any more’n\nthe man did what got hooked by a cow one mornin’, before breakfast.\nIt didn’t improve his appetite much.”",
        "“I’ve most broke my arm,” said Micky, ruefully, rubbing the affected\nlimb.",
        "“If it’s broke you can’t fire no more stones, which is a very\ncheerin’ reflection,” said Dick. “Ef you haven’t money enough to buy\na wooden one I’ll lend you a quarter. There’s one good thing about\nwooden ones, they aint liable to get cold in winter, which is\nanother cheerin’ reflection.”",
        "“I don’t want none of yer cheerin’ reflections,” said Micky,\nsullenly. “Yer company aint wanted here.”",
        "“Thank you for your polite invitation to leave,” said Dick, bowing\nceremoniously. “I’m willin’ to go, but ef you throw any more stones\nat me, Micky Maguire, I’ll hurt you worse than the stones did.”",
        "The only answer made to this warning was a scowl from his fallen\nopponent. It was quite evident that Dick had the best of it, and\nhe thought it prudent to say nothing.",
        "“As I’ve got a friend waitin’ outside, I shall have to tear myself\naway,” said Dick. “You’d better not throw any more stones, Micky\nMaguire, for it don’t seem to agree with your constitution.”",
        "Micky muttered something which Dick did not stay to hear. He backed\nout of the alley, keeping a watchful eye on his fallen foe, and\nrejoined Henry Fosdick, who was awaiting his return.",
        "“Who was it, Dick?” he asked.",
        "“A partic’lar friend of mine, Micky Maguire,” said Dick. “He\nplayfully fired a rock at my head as a mark of his ’fection. He\nloves me like a brother, Micky does.”",
        "“Rather a dangerous kind of a friend, I should think,\"\nsaid Fosdick. “He might have killed you.”",
        "“I’ve warned him not to be so ’fectionate another time,” said Dick.",
        "“I know him,” said Henry Fosdick. “He’s at the head of a gang of\nboys living at the Five-Points. He threatened to whip me once\nbecause a gentleman employed me to black his boots instead of him.”",
        "“He’s been at the Island two or three times for stealing,” said\nDick. “I guess he won’t touch me again. He’d rather get hold of\nsmall boys. If he ever does anything to you, Fosdick, just let\nme know, and I’ll give him a thrashing.”",
        "Dick was right. Micky Maguire was a bully, and like most bullies did\nnot fancy tackling boys whose strength was equal or superior to his\nown. Although he hated Dick more than ever, because he thought our\nhero was putting on airs, he had too lively a remembrance of his\nstrength and courage to venture upon another open attack. He\ncontented himself, therefore, whenever he met Dick, with scowling at\nhim. Dick took this very philosophically, remarking that, “if it was\nsoothin’ to Micky’s feelings, he might go ahead, as it didn’t hurt\nhim much.”",
        "It will not be necessary to chronicle the events of the next few\nweeks. A new life had commenced for Dick. He no longer haunted the\ngallery of the Old Bowery; and even Tony Pastor’s hospitable doors\nhad lost their old attractions. He spent two hours every evening in\nstudy. His progress was astonishingly rapid. He was gifted with a\nnatural quickness; and he was stimulated by the desire to acquire a\nfair education as a means of “growin’ up ’spectable,” as he termed\nit. Much was due also to the patience and perseverance of Henry\nFosdick, who made a capital teacher.",
        "“You’re improving wonderfully, Dick,” said his friend, one evening,\nwhen Dick had read an entire paragraph without a mistake.",
        "“Am I?” said Dick, with satisfaction.",
        "“Yes. If you’ll buy a writing-book to-morrow, we can begin writing\nto-morrow evening.”",
        "“What else do you know, Henry?” asked Dick.",
        "“Arithmetic, and geography, and grammar.”",
        "“What a lot you know!” said Dick, admiringly.",
        "“I don’t know any of them,” said Fosdick. “I’ve only studied them.\nI wish I knew a great deal more.”",
        "“I’ll be satisfied when I know as much as you,” said Dick.",
        "“It seems a great deal to you now, Dick, but in a few months you’ll\nthink differently. The more you know, the more you’ll want to know.”",
        "“Then there aint any end to learnin’?” said Dick.",
        "“No.”",
        "“Well,” said Dick, “I guess I’ll be as much as sixty before I\nknow everything.”",
        "“Yes; as old as that, probably,” said Fosdick, laughing.",
        "“Anyway, you know too much to be blackin’ boots. Leave that to\nignorant chaps like me.”",
        "“You won’t be ignorant long, Dick.”",
        "“You’d ought to get into some office or countin’-room.”",
        "“I wish I could,” said Fosdick, earnestly. “I don’t succeed very\nwell at blacking boots. You make a great deal more than I do.”",
        "“That’s cause I aint troubled with bashfulness,” said Dick.\n\"Bashfulness aint as natural to me as it is to you. I’m always on\nhand, as the cat said to the milk. You’d better give up shines,\nFosdick, and give your ’tention to mercantile pursuits.”",
        "“I’ve thought of trying to get a place,” said Fosdick; “but no one\nwould take me with these clothes;” and he directed his glance to his\nwell-worn suit, which he kept as neat as he could, but which, in\nspite of all his care, began to show decided marks of use. There\nwas also here and there a stain of blacking upon it, which, though\nan advertisement of his profession, scarcely added to its good\nappearance.",
        "“I almost wanted to stay at home from Sunday school last Sunday,” he\ncontinued, “because I thought everybody would notice how dirty and\nworn my clothes had got to be.”",
        "“If my clothes wasn’t two sizes too big for you,” said Dick,\ngenerously, “I’d change. You’d look as if you’d got into your\ngreat-uncle’s suit by mistake.”",
        "“You’re very kind, Dick, to think of changing,” said Fosdick, “for\nyour suit is much better than mine; but I don’t think that mine\nwould suit you very well. The pants would show a little more of\nyour ankles than is the fashion, and you couldn’t eat a very hearty\ndinner without bursting the buttons off the vest.”",
        "“That wouldn’t be very convenient,” said Dick. “I aint fond of\nlacin’ to show my elegant figger. But I say,” he added with a\nsudden thought, “how much money have we got in the savings’ bank?”",
        "Fosdick took a key from his pocket, and went to the drawer in which\nthe bank-books were kept, and, opening it, brought them out for\ninspection.",
        "It was found that Dick had the sum of eighteen dollars and ninety\ncents placed to his credit, while Fosdick had six dollars and\nforty-five cents. To explain the large difference, it must be\nremembered that Dick had deposited five dollars before Henry\ndeposited anything, being the amount he had received as a gift\nfrom Mr. Whitney.",
        "“How much does that make, the lot of it?” asked Dick. “I aint much\non figgers yet, you know.”",
        "“It makes twenty-five dollars and thirty-five cents, Dick,” said his\ncompanion, who did not understand the thought which suggested the\nquestion.",
        "“Take it, and buy some clothes, Henry,” said Dick, shortly.",
        "“What, your money too?”",
        "“In course.”",
        "“No, Dick, you are too generous. I couldn’t think of it. Almost\nthree-quarters of the money is yours. You must spend it on\nyourself.”",
        "“I don’t need it,” said Dick.",
        "“You may not need it now, but you will some time.”",
        "“I shall have some more then.”",
        "“That may be; but it wouldn’t be fair for me to use your money,\nDick. I thank you all the same for your kindness.”",
        "“Well, I’ll lend it to you, then,” persisted Dick, “and you can pay\nme when you get to be a rich merchant.”",
        "“But it isn’t likely I ever shall be one.”",
        "“How d’you know? I went to a fortun’ teller once, and she told me I\nwas born under a lucky star with a hard name, and I should have a\nrich man for my particular friend, who would make my fortun’. I\nguess you are going to be the rich man.”",
        "Fosdick laughed, and steadily refused for some time to avail himself\nof Dick’s generous proposal; but at length, perceiving that our hero\nseemed much disappointed, and would be really glad if his offer were\naccepted, he agreed to use as much as might be needful.",
        "This at once brought back Dick’s good-humor, and he entered\nwith great enthusiasm into his friend’s plans.",
        "The next day they withdrew the money from the bank, and, when\nbusiness got a little slack, in the afternoon set out in search of\na clothing store. Dick knew enough of the city to be able to find a\nplace where a good bargain could be obtained. He was determined that\nFosdick should have a good serviceable suit, even if it took all the\nmoney they had. The result of their search was that for twenty-three\ndollars Fosdick obtained a very neat outfit, including a couple of\nshirts, a hat, and a pair of shoes, besides a dark mixed suit, which\nappeared stout and of good quality.",
        "“Shall I sent the bundle home?” asked the salesman, impressed by the\noff-hand manner in which Dick drew out the money in payment for the\nclothes.",
        "“Thank you,” said Dick, “you’re very kind, but I’ll take it home\nmyself, and you can allow me something for my trouble.”",
        "“All right,” said the clerk, laughing; “I’ll allow it on your next\npurchase.”",
        "Proceeding to their apartment in Mott Street, Fosdick at once tried\non his new suit, and it was found to be an excellent fit. Dick\nsurveyed his new friend with much satisfaction.",
        "“You look like a young gentleman of fortun’,” he said, “and do\ncredit to your governor.”",
        "“I suppose that means you, Dick,” said Fosdick, laughing.",
        "“In course it does.”",
        "“You should say of course,” said Fosdick, who, in virtue of his\nposition as Dick’s tutor, ventured to correct his language from time\nto time.",
        "“How dare you correct your gov’nor?” said Dick, with comic\nindignation. “’I’ll cut you off with a shillin’, you young dog,’ as\nthe Markis says to his nephew in the play at the Old Bowery.”",
        "Fosdick did not venture to wear his new clothes while engaged in his\nbusiness. This he felt would have been wasteful extravagance. About\nten o’clock in the morning, when business slackened, he went home,\nand dressing himself went to a hotel where he could see copies of\nthe “Morning Herald” and “Sun,” and, noting down the places where a\nboy was wanted, went on a round of applications. But he found it no\neasy thing to obtain a place. Swarms of boys seemed to be out of\nemployment, and it was not unusual to find from fifty to a hundred\napplicants for a single place.",
        "There was another difficulty. It was generally desired that the\nboy wanted should reside with his parents. When Fosdick, on being\nquestioned, revealed the fact of his having no parents, and being\na boy of the street, this was generally sufficient of itself to\ninsure a refusal. Merchants were afraid to trust one who had led\nsuch a vagabond life. Dick, who was always ready for an emergency,\nsuggested borrowing a white wig, and passing himself off for\nFosdick’s father or grandfather. But Henry thought this might be\nrather a difficult character for our hero to sustain. After fifty\napplications and as many failures, Fosdick began to get discouraged.\nThere seemed to be no way out of his present business, for which he\nfelt unfitted.",
        "“I don’t know but I shall have to black boots all my life,” he said,\none day, despondently, to Dick.",
        "“Keep a stiff upper lip,” said Dick. “By the time you get to be a\ngray-headed veteran, you may get a chance to run errands for some\nbig firm on the Bowery, which is a very cheerin’ reflection.”",
        "So Dick by his drollery and perpetual good spirits kept up\nFosdick’s courage.",
        "“As for me,” said Dick, “I expect by that time to lay up a colossal\nfortun’ out of shines, and live in princely style on the Avenoo.”",
        "But one morning, Fosdick, straying into French’s Hotel, discovered\nthe following advertisement in the columns of “The Herald,\"–",
        "“WANTED–A smart, capable boy to run errands, and make himself\ngenerally useful in a hat and cap store. Salary three dollars a\nweek at first. Inquire at No. – Broadway, after ten o’clock, A.M.”",
        "He determined to make application, and, as the City Hall clock just\nthen struck the hour indicated, lost no time in proceeding to the\nstore, which was only a few blocks distant from the Astor House.\nIt was easy to find the store, as from a dozen to twenty boys were\nalready assembled in front of it. They surveyed each other askance,\nfeeling that they were rivals, and mentally calculating each other’s\nchances.",
        "“There isn’t much chance for me,” said Fosdick to Dick, who had\naccompanied him. “Look at all these boys. Most of them have good\nhomes, I suppose, and good recommendations, while I have nobody to\nrefer to.”",
        "“Go ahead,” said Dick. “Your chance is as good as anybody’s.”",
        "While this was passing between Dick and his companion, one of the\nboys, a rather supercilious-looking young gentleman, genteelly\ndressed, and evidently having a very high opinion of his dress and\nhimself turned suddenly to Dick, and remarked,–",
        "“I’ve seen you before.”",
        "“Oh, have you?” said Dick, whirling round; “then p’r’aps you’d like\nto see me behind.”",
        "At this unexpected answer all the boys burst into a laugh with the\nexception of the questioner, who, evidently, considered that Dick\nhad been disrespectful.",
        "“I’ve seen you somewhere,” he said, in a surly tone, correcting\nhimself.",
        "“Most likely you have,” said Dick. “That’s where I generally keep\nmyself.”",
        "There was another laugh at the expense of Roswell Crawford, for that\nwas the name of the young aristocrat. But he had his revenge ready.\nNo boy relishes being an object of ridicule, and it was with a\nfeeling of satisfaction that he retorted,–",
        "“I know you for all your impudence. You’re nothing but a\nboot-black.”",
        "This information took the boys who were standing around by surprise,\nfor Dick was well-dressed, and had none of the implements of his\nprofession with him.",
        "“S’pose I be,” said Dick. “Have you got any objection?”",
        "“Not at all,” said Roswell, curling his lip; “only you’d better\nstick to blacking boots, and not try to get into a store.”",
        "“Thank you for your kind advice,” said Dick. “Is it gratooitous, or\ndo you expect to be paid for it?”",
        "“You’re an impudent fellow.”",
        "“That’s a very cheerin’ reflection,” said Dick, good-naturedly.",
        "“Do you expect to get this place when there’s gentlemen’s sons\napplying for it? A boot-black in a store! That would be a good\njoke.”",
        "Boys as well as men are selfish, and, looking upon Dick as a\npossible rival, the boys who listened seemed disposed to take the\nsame view of the situation.",
        "“That’s what I say,” said one of them, taking sides with Roswell.",
        "“Don’t trouble yourselves,” said Dick. “I aint agoin’ to cut you\nout. I can’t afford to give up a independent and loocrative\npurfession for a salary of three dollars a week.”",
        "“Hear him talk!” said Roswell Crawford, with an unpleasant sneer.\n\"If you are not trying to get the place, what are you here for?”",
        "“I came with a friend of mine,” said Dick, indicating Fosdick,\n\"who’s goin’ in for the situation.”",
        "“Is he a boot-black, too?” demanded Roswell, superciliously.",
        "“He!” retorted Dick, loftily. “Didn’t you know his father was a\nmember of Congress, and intimately acquainted with all the biggest\nmen in the State?”",
        "The boys surveyed Fosdick as if they did not quite know whether to\ncredit this statement, which, for the credit of Dick’s veracity, it\nwill be observed he did not assert, but only propounded in the form\nof a question. There was no time for comment, however, as just then\nthe proprietor of the store came to the door, and, casting his eyes\nover the waiting group, singled out Roswell Crawford, and asked him\nto enter.",
        "“Well, my lad, how old are you?”",
        "“Fourteen years old,” said Roswell, consequentially.",
        "“Are your parents living?”",
        "“Only my mother. My father is dead. He was a gentleman,” he added,\ncomplacently.",
        "“Oh, was he?” said the shop-keeper. “Do you live in the city?”",
        "“Yes, sir. In Clinton Place.”",
        "“Have you ever been in a situation before?”",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Roswell, a little reluctantly.",
        "“Where was it?”",
        "“In an office on Dey Street.”",
        "“How long were you there?”",
        "“A week.”",
        "“It seems to me that was a short time. Why did you not stay longer?”",
        "“Because,” said Roswell, loftily, “the man wanted me to get to the\noffice at eight o’clock, and make the fire. I’m a gentleman’s son,\nand am not used to such dirty work.”",
        "“Indeed!” said the shop-keeper. “Well, young gentleman, you may step\naside a few minutes. I will speak with some of the other boys before\nmaking my selection.”",
        "Several other boys were called in and questioned. Roswell stood by\nand listened with an air of complacency. He could not help thinking\nhis chances the best. “The man can see I’m a gentleman, and will do\ncredit to his store,” he thought.",
        "At length it came to Fosdick’s turn. He entered with no very\nsanguine anticipations of success. Unlike Roswell, he set a very low\nestimate upon his qualifications when compared with those of other\napplicants. But his modest bearing, and quiet, gentlemanly manner,\nentirely free from pretension, prepossessed the shop-keeper, who was\na sensible man, in his favor.",
        "“Do you reside in the city?” he asked.",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Henry.",
        "“What is your age?”",
        "“Twelve.”",
        "“Have you ever been in any situation?”",
        "“No, sir.”",
        "“I should like to see a specimen of your handwriting.\nHere, take the pen and write your name.”",
        "Henry Fosdick had a very handsome handwriting for a boy of his age,\nwhile Roswell, who had submitted to the same test, could do little\nmore than scrawl.",
        "“Do you reside with your parents?”",
        "“No, sir, they are dead.”",
        "“Where do you live, then?”",
        "“In Mott Street.”",
        "Roswell curled his lip when this name was pronounced, for Mott\nStreet, as my New York readers know, is in the immediate\nneighborhood of the Five-Points, and very far from a fashionable\nlocality.",
        "“Have you any testimonials to present?” asked Mr. Henderson, for\nthat was his name.",
        "Fosdick hesitated. This was the question which he had foreseen would\ngive him trouble.",
        "But at this moment it happened most opportunely that Mr. Greyson\nentered the shop with the intention of buying a hat.",
        "“Yes,” said Fosdick, promptly; “I will refer to this gentleman.”",
        "“How do you do, Fosdick?” asked Mr. Greyson, noticing him for the\nfirst time. “How do you happen to be here?”",
        "“I am applying for a place, sir,” said Fosdick. “May I refer the\ngentleman to you?”",
        "“Certainly, I shall be glad to speak a good word for you. Mr.\nHenderson, this is a member of my Sunday-school class, of whose good\nqualities and good abilities I can speak confidently.”",
        "“That will be sufficient,” said the shop-keeper, who knew Mr.\nGreyson’s high character and position. “He could have no better\nrecommendation. You may come to the store to-morrow morning at half\npast seven o’clock. The pay will be three dollars a week for the\nfirst six months. If I am satisfied with you, I shall then raise\nit to five dollars.”",
        "The other boys looked disappointed, but none more so than Roswell\nCrawford. He would have cared less if any one else had obtained the\nsituation; but for a boy who lived in Mott Street to be preferred\nto him, a gentleman’s son, he considered indeed humiliating. In a\nspirit of petty spite, he was tempted to say,",
        "“He’s a boot-black. Ask him if he isn’t.”",
        "“He’s an honest and intelligent lad,” said Mr. Greyson. “As for you,\nyoung man, I only hope you have one-half his good qualities.”",
        "Roswell Crawford left the store in disgust, and the other\nunsuccessful applicants with him.",
        "“What luck, Fosdick?” asked Dick, eagerly, as his friend came out of\nthe store.",
        "“I’ve got the place,” said Fosdick, in accents of satisfaction; “but\nit was only because Mr. Greyson spoke up for me.”",
        "“He’s a trump,” said Dick, enthusiastically.",
        "The gentleman, so denominated, came out before the boys went away,\nand spoke with them kindly.",
        "Both Dick and Henry were highly pleased at the success of the\napplication. The pay would indeed be small, but, expended\neconomically, Fosdick thought he could get along on it, receiving\nhis room rent, as before, in return for his services as Dick’s\nprivate tutor. Dick determined, as soon as his education would\npermit, to follow his companion’s example.",
        "“I don’t know as you’ll be willin’ to room with a boot-black,” he\nsaid, to Henry, “now you’re goin’ into business.”",
        "“I couldn’t room with a better friend, Dick,” said Fosdick,\naffectionately, throwing his arm round our hero. “When we part,\nit’ll be because you wish it.”",
        "So Fosdick entered upon a new career.",
        "The next morning Fosdick rose early, put on his new suit, and, after\ngetting breakfast, set out for the Broadway store in which he had\nobtained a position. He left his little blacking-box in the room.",
        "“It’ll do to brush my own shoes,” he said. “Who knows but I may have\nto come back to it again?”",
        "“No danger,” said Dick; “I’ll take care of the feet, and you’ll have\nto look after the heads, now you’re in a hat-store.”",
        "“I wish you had a place too,” said Fosdick.",
        "“I don’t know enough yet,” said Dick. “Wait till I’ve gradooated.”",
        "“And can put A.B. after your name.”",
        "“What’s that?”",
        "“It stands for Bachelor of Arts. It’s a degree that students get\nwhen they graduate from college.”",
        "“Oh,” said Dick, “I didn’t know but it meant A Boot-black. I can put\nthat after my name now. Wouldn’t Dick Hunter, A.B., sound tip-top?”",
        "“I must be going,” said Fosdick. “It won’t do for me to be late the\nvery first morning.”",
        "“That’s the difference between you and me,” said Dick. “I’m my own\nboss, and there aint no one to find fault with me if I’m late. But I\nmight as well be goin’ too. There’s a gent as comes down to his\nstore pretty early that generally wants a shine.”",
        "The two boys parted at the Park. Fosdick crossed it, and proceeded\nto the hat-store, while Dick, hitching up his pants, began to look\nabout him for a customer. It was seldom that Dick had to wait long.\nHe was always on the alert, and if there was any business to do\nhe was always sure to get his share of it. He had now a stronger\ninducement than ever to attend strictly to business; his little\nstock of money in the savings bank having been nearly exhausted by\nhis liberality to his room-mate. He determined to be as economical\nas possible, and moreover to study as hard as he could, that he\nmight be able to follow Fosdick’s example, and obtain a place in\na store or counting-room. As there were no striking incidents\noccurring in our hero’s history within the next nine months, I\npropose to pass over that period, and recount the progress he made\nin that time.",
        "Fosdick was still at the hat-store, having succeeded in giving\nperfect satisfaction to Mr. Henderson. His wages had just been\nraised to five dollars a week. He and Dick still kept house together\nat Mrs. Mooney’s lodging-house, and lived very frugally, so that\nboth were able to save up money. Dick had been unusually successful\nin business. He had several regular patrons, who had been drawn to\nhim by his ready wit, and quick humor, and from two of them he had\nreceived presents of clothing, which had saved him any expense on\nthat score. His income had averaged quite seven dollars a week in\naddition to this. Of this amount he was now obliged to pay one\ndollar weekly for the room which he and Fosdick occupied, but he\nwas still able to save one half the remainder. At the end of nine\nmonths therefore, or thirty-nine weeks, it will be seen that he had\naccumulated no less a sum than one hundred and seventeen dollars.\nDick may be excused for feeling like a capitalist when he looked at\nthe long row of deposits in his little bank-book. There were other\nboys in the same business who had earned as much money, but they\nhad had little care for the future, and spent as they went along,\nso that few could boast a bank-account, however small.",
        "“You’ll be a rich man some time, Dick,” said Henry Fosdick,\none evening.",
        "“And live on Fifth Avenoo,” said Dick.",
        "“Perhaps so. Stranger things have happened.”",
        "“Well,” said Dick, “if such a misfortin’ should come upon me I\nshould bear it like a man. When you see a Fifth Avenoo manshun for\nsale for a hundred and seventeen dollars, just let me know and I’ll\nbuy it as an investment.”",
        "“Two hundred and fifty years ago you might have bought one for that\nprice, probably. Real estate wasn’t very high among the Indians.”",
        "“Just my luck,” said Dick; “I was born too late. I’d orter have been\nan Indian, and lived in splendor on my present capital.”",
        "“I’m afraid you’d have found your present business rather\nunprofitable at that time.”",
        "But Dick had gained something more valuable than money. He had\nstudied regularly every evening, and his improvement had been\nmarvellous. He could now read well, write a fair hand, and had\nstudied arithmetic as far as Interest. Besides this he had obtained\nsome knowledge of grammar and geography. If some of my boy readers,\nwho have been studying for years, and got no farther than this,\nshould think it incredible that Dick, in less than a year, and\nstudying evenings only, should have accomplished it, they must\nremember that our hero was very much in earnest in his desire to\nimprove. He knew that, in order to grow up respectable, he must be\nwell advanced, and he was willing to work. But then the reader must\nnot forget that Dick was naturally a smart boy. His street education\nhad sharpened his faculties, and taught him to rely upon himself. He\nknew that it would take him a long time to reach the goal which he\nhad set before him, and he had patience to keep on trying. He knew\nthat he had only himself to depend upon, and he determined to make\nthe most of himself,–a resolution which is the secret of success\nin nine cases out of ten.",
        "“Dick,” said Fosdick, one evening, after they had completed their\nstudies, “I think you’ll have to get another teacher soon.”",
        "“Why?” asked Dick, in some surprise. “Have you been offered a more\nloocrative position?”",
        "“No,” said Fosdick, “but I find I have taught you all I know myself.\nYou are now as good a scholar as I am.”",
        "“Is that true?” said Dick, eagerly, a flush of gratification\ncoloring his brown cheek.",
        "“Yes,” said Fosdick. “You’ve made wonderful progress. I propose,\nnow that evening schools have begun, that we join one, and study\ntogether through the winter.”",
        "“All right,” said Dick. “I’d be willin’ to go now; but when I first\nbegan to study I was ashamed to have anybody know that I was so\nignorant. Do you really mean, Fosdick, that I know as much as you?”",
        "“Yes, Dick, it’s true.”",
        "“Then I’ve got you to thank for it,” said Dick, earnestly. “You’ve\nmade me what I am.”",
        "“And haven’t you paid me, Dick?”",
        "“By payin’ the room-rent,” said Dick, impulsively. “What’s that? It\nisn’t half enough. I wish you’d take half my money; you deserve it.”",
        "“Thank you, Dick, but you’re too generous. You’ve more than paid me.\nWho was it took my part when all the other boys imposed upon me? And\nwho gave me money to buy clothes, and so got me my situation?”",
        "“Oh, that’s nothing!” said Dick.",
        "“It’s a great deal, Dick. I shall never forget it. But now it seems\nto me you might try to get a situation yourself.”",
        "“Do I know enough?”",
        "“You know as much as I do.”",
        "“Then I’ll try,” said Dick, decidedly.",
        "“I wish there was a place in our store,” said Fosdick. “It would be\npleasant for us to be together.”",
        "“Never mind,” said Dick; “there’ll be plenty of other chances.\nP’r’aps A. T. Stewart might like a partner. I wouldn’t ask more’n a\nquarter of the profits.”",
        "“Which would be a very liberal proposal on your part,” said Fosdick,\nsmiling. “But perhaps Mr. Stewart might object to a partner living\non Mott Street.”",
        "“I’d just as lieves move to Fifth Avenoo,” said Dick. “I aint got no\nprejudices in favor of Mott Street.”",
        "“Nor I,” said Fosdick, “and in fact I have been thinking it might be\na good plan for us to move as soon as we could afford. Mrs. Mooney\ndoesn’t keep the room quite so neat as she might.”",
        "“No,” said Dick. “She aint got no prejudices against dirt. Look at\nthat towel.”",
        "Dick held up the article indicated, which had now seen service\nnearly a week, and hard service at that,–Dick’s avocation causing\nhim to be rather hard on towels.",
        "“Yes,” said Fosdick, “I’ve got about tired of it. I guess we can\nfind some better place without having to pay much more. When we\nmove, you must let me pay my share of the rent.”",
        "“We’ll see about that,” said Dick. “Do you propose to move to\nFifth Avenoo?”",
        "“Not just at present, but to some more agreeable neighborhood than\nthis. We’ll wait till you get a situation, and then we can decide.”",
        "A few days later, as Dick was looking about for customers in the\nneighborhood of the Park, his attention was drawn to a fellow\nboot-black, a boy about a year younger than himself, who appeared to\nhave been crying.",
        "“What’s the matter, Tom?” asked Dick. “Haven’t you had luck to-day?”",
        "“Pretty good,” said the boy; “but we’re havin’ hard times at home.\nMother fell last week and broke her arm, and to-morrow we’ve got to\npay the rent, and if we don’t the landlord says he’ll turn us out.”",
        "“Haven’t you got anything except what you earn?” asked Dick.",
        "“No,” said Tom, “not now. Mother used to earn three or four dollars\na week; but she can’t do nothin’ now, and my little sister and\nbrother are too young.”",
        "Dick had quick sympathies. He had been so poor himself, and\nobliged to submit to so many privations that he knew from personal\nexperience how hard it was. Tom Wilkins he knew as an excellent boy\nwho never squandered his money, but faithfully carried it home to\nhis mother. In the days of his own extravagance and shiftlessness\nhe had once or twice asked Tom to accompany him to the Old Bowery\nor Tony Pastor’s, but Tom had always steadily refused.",
        "“I’m sorry for you, Tom,” he said. “How much do you owe for rent?”",
        "“Two weeks now,” said Tom.",
        "“How much is it a week?”",
        "“Two dollars a week–that makes four.”",
        "“Have you got anything towards it?”",
        "“No; I’ve had to spend all my money for food for mother and the rest\nof us. I’ve had pretty hard work to do that. I don’t know what we’ll\ndo. I haven’t any place to go to, and I’m afraid mother’ll get cold\nin her arm.”",
        "“Can’t you borrow the money somewhere?” asked Dick.",
        "Tom shook his head despondingly.",
        "“All the people I know are as poor as I am,” said he. “They’d help\nme if they could, but it’s hard work for them to get along\nthemselves.”",
        "“I’ll tell you what, Tom,” said Dick, impulsively, “I’ll stand your\nfriend.”",
        "“Have you got any money?” asked Tom, doubtfully.",
        "“Got any money!” repeated Dick. “Don’t you know that I run a bank on\nmy own account? How much is it you need?”",
        "“Four dollars,” said Tom. “If we don’t pay that before to-morrow\nnight, out we go. You haven’t got as much as that, have you?”",
        "“Here are three dollars,” said Dick, drawing out his pocket-book.\n\"I’ll let you have the rest to-morrow, and maybe a little more.”",
        "“You’re a right down good fellow, Dick,” said Tom; “but won’t you\nwant it yourself?”",
        "“Oh, I’ve got some more,” said Dick.",
        "“Maybe I’ll never be able to pay you.”",
        "“S’pose you don’t,” said Dick; “I guess I won’t fail.”",
        "“I won’t forget it, Dick. I hope I’ll be able to do somethin’ for\nyou sometime.”",
        "“All right,” said Dick. “I’d ought to help you. I haven’t got no\nmother to look out for. I wish I had.”",
        "There was a tinge of sadness in his tone, as he pronounced the last\nfour words; but Dick’s temperament was sanguine, and he never gave\nway to unavailing sadness. Accordingly he began to whistle as he\nturned away, only adding, “I’ll see you to-morrow, Tom.”",
        "The three dollars which Dick had handed to Tom Wilkins were his\nsavings for the present week. It was now Thursday afternoon. His\nrent, which amounted to a dollar, he expected to save out of the\nearnings of Friday and Saturday. In order to give Tom the additional\nassistance he had promised, Dick would be obliged to have recourse\nto his bank-savings. He would not have ventured to trench upon it\nfor any other reason but this. But he felt that it would be selfish\nto allow Tom and his mother to suffer when he had it in his power\nto relieve them. But Dick was destined to be surprised, and that in\na disagreeable manner, when he reached home.",
        "It was hinted at the close of the last chapter that Dick was\ndestined to be disagreeably surprised on reaching home.",
        "Having agreed to give further assistance to Tom Wilkins, he was\nnaturally led to go to the drawer where he and Fosdick kept their\nbank-books. To his surprise and uneasiness the drawer proved to be\nempty!\n\"Come here a minute, Fosdick,” he said.",
        "“What’s the matter, Dick?”",
        "“I can’t find my bank-book, nor yours either. What’s ’come of them?”",
        "“I took mine with me this morning, thinking I might want to put in a\nlittle more money. I’ve got it in my pocket, now.”",
        "“But where’s mine?” asked Dick, perplexed.",
        "“I don’t know. I saw it in the drawer when I took mine this morning.”",
        "“Are you sure?”",
        "“Yes, positive, for I looked into it to see how much you had got.”",
        "“Did you lock it again?” asked Dick.",
        "“Yes; didn’t you have to unlock it just now?”",
        "“So I did,” said Dick. “But it’s gone now. Somebody opened it with a\nkey that fitted the lock, and then locked it ag’in.”",
        "“That must have been the way.”",
        "“It’s rather hard on a feller,” said Dick, who, for the first time\nsince we became acquainted with him, began to feel down-hearted.",
        "“Don’t give it up, Dick. You haven’t lost the money, only the\nbank-book.”",
        "“Aint that the same thing?”",
        "“No. You can go to the bank to-morrow morning, as soon as it opens,\nand tell them you have lost the book, and ask them not to pay the\nmoney to any one except yourself.”",
        "“So I can,” said Dick, brightening up. “That is, if the thief hasn’t\nbeen to the bank to-day.”",
        "“If he has, they might detect him by his handwriting.”",
        "“I’d like to get hold of the one that stole it,” said Dick,\nindignantly. “I’d give him a good lickin’.”",
        "“It must have been somebody in the house. Suppose we go and see Mrs.\nMooney. She may know whether anybody came into our room to-day.”",
        "The two boys went downstairs, and knocked at the door of a little\nback sitting-room where Mrs. Mooney generally spent her evenings. It\nwas a shabby little room, with a threadbare carpet on the floor, the\nwalls covered with a certain large-figured paper, patches of which\nhad been stripped off here and there, exposing the plaster, the\nremainder being defaced by dirt and grease. But Mrs. Mooney had one\nof those comfortable temperaments which are tolerant of dirt, and\ndidn’t mind it in the least. She was seated beside a small pine\nwork-table, industriously engaged in mending stockings.",
        "“Good-evening, Mrs. Mooney,” said Fosdick, politely.",
        "“Good-evening,” said the landlady. “Sit down, if you can find\nchairs. I’m hard at work as you see, but a poor lone widder can’t\nafford to be idle.”",
        "“We can’t stop long, Mrs. Mooney, but my friend here has had\nsomething taken from his room to-day, and we thought we’d come and\nsee you about it.”",
        "“What is it?” asked the landlady. “You don’t think I’d take\nanything? If I am poor, it’s an honest name I’ve always had, as all\nmy lodgers can testify.”",
        "“Certainly not, Mrs. Mooney; but there are others in the house that\nmay not be honest. My friend has lost his bank-book. It was safe in\nthe drawer this morning, but to-night it is not to be found.”",
        "“How much money was there in it?” asked Mrs. Mooney.",
        "“Over a hundred dollars,” said Fosdick.",
        "“It was my whole fortun’,” said Dick. “I was goin’ to buy a house\nnext year.”",
        "Mrs. Mooney was evidently surprised to learn the extent of Dick’s\nwealth, and was disposed to regard him with increased respect.",
        "“Was the drawer locked?” she asked.",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Then it couldn’t have been Bridget. I don’t think she has any\nkeys.”",
        "“She wouldn’t know what a bank-book was,” said Fosdick. “You didn’t\nsee any of the lodgers go into our room to-day, did you?”",
        "“I shouldn’t wonder if it was Jim Travis,” said Mrs. Mooney, suddenly.",
        "This James Travis was a bar-tender in a low groggery in Mulberry\nStreet, and had been for a few weeks an inmate of Mrs. Mooney’s\nlodging-house. He was a coarse-looking fellow who, from his\nappearance, evidently patronized liberally the liquor he dealt out\nto others. He occupied a room opposite Dick’s, and was often heard\nby the two boys reeling upstairs in a state of intoxication,\nuttering shocking oaths.",
        "This Travis had made several friendly overtures to Dick and his\nroom-mate, and had invited them to call round at the bar-room where\nhe tended, and take something. But this invitation had never been\naccepted, partly because the boys were better engaged in the\nevening, and partly because neither of them had taken a fancy to Mr.\nTravis; which certainly was not strange, for nature had not gifted\nhim with many charms, either of personal appearance or manners. The\nrejection of his friendly proffers had caused him to take a dislike\nto Dick and Henry, whom he considered stiff and unsocial.",
        "“What makes you think it was Travis?” asked Fosdick. “He isn’t at\nhome in the daytime.”",
        "“But he was to-day. He said he had got a bad cold, and had to come\nhome for a clean handkerchief.”",
        "“Did you see him?” asked Dick.",
        "“Yes,” said Mrs. Mooney. “Bridget was hanging out clothes, and I\nwent to the door to let him in.”",
        "“I wonder if he had a key that would fit our drawer,” said Fosdick.",
        "“Yes,” said Mrs. Mooney. “The bureaus in the two rooms are just\nalike. I got ’em at auction, and most likely the locks is the same.”",
        "“It must have been he,” said Dick, looking towards Fosdick.",
        "“Yes,” said Fosdick, “it looks like it.”",
        "“What’s to be done? That’s what I’d like to know,” said Dick. “Of\ncourse he’ll say he hasn’t got it; and he won’t be such a fool as to\nleave it in his room.”",
        "“If he hasn’t been to the bank, it’s all right,” said Fosdick. “You\ncan go there the first thing to-morrow morning, and stop their\npaying any money on it.”",
        "“But I can’t get any money on it myself,” said Dick. “I told Tom\nWilkins I’d let him have some more money to-morrow, or his sick\nmother’ll have to turn out of their lodgin’s.”",
        "“How much money were you going to give him?”",
        "“I gave him three dollars to-day, and was goin’ to give him two\ndollars to-morrow.”",
        "“I’ve got the money, Dick. I didn’t go to the bank this morning.”",
        "“All right. I’ll take it, and pay you back next week.”",
        "“No, Dick; if you’ve given three dollars, you must let me give two.”",
        "“No, Fosdick, I’d rather give the whole. You know I’ve got more\nmoney than you. No, I haven’t, either,” said Dick, the memory of his\nloss flashing upon him. “I thought I was rich this morning, but now\nI’m in destitoot circumstances.”",
        "“Cheer up, Dick; you’ll get your money back.”",
        "“I hope so,” said our hero, rather ruefully.",
        "The fact was, that our friend Dick was beginning to feel what is\nso often experienced by men who do business of a more important\ncharacter and on a larger scale than he, the bitterness of a reverse\nof circumstances. With one hundred dollars and over carefully laid\naway in the savings bank, he had felt quite independent. Wealth is\ncomparative, and Dick probably felt as rich as many men who are\nworth a hundred thousand dollars. He was beginning to feel the\nadvantages of his steady self-denial, and to experience the\npleasures of property. Not that Dick was likely to be unduly\nattached to money. Let it be said to his credit that it had never\ngiven him so much satisfaction as when it enabled him to help Tom\nWilkins in his trouble.",
        "Besides this, there was another thought that troubled him. When he\nobtained a place he could not expect to receive as much as he was\nnow making from blacking boots,–probably not more than three\ndollars a week,–while his expenses without clothing would amount to\nfour dollars. To make up the deficiency he had confidently relied\nupon his savings, which would be sufficient to carry him along for a\nyear, if necessary. If he should not recover his money, he would be\ncompelled to continue a boot-black for at least six months longer;\nand this was rather a discouraging reflection. On the whole it is\nnot to be wondered at that Dick felt unusually sober this evening,\nand that neither of the boys felt much like studying.",
        "The two boys consulted as to whether it would be best to speak to\nTravis about it. It was not altogether easy to decide. Fosdick was\nopposed to it.",
        "“It will only put him on his guard,” said he, “and I don’t see as it\nwill do any good. Of course he will deny it. We’d better keep quiet,\nand watch him, and, by giving notice at the bank, we can make sure\nthat he doesn’t get any money on it. If he does present himself at\nthe bank, they will know at once that he is a thief, and he can be\narrested.”",
        "This view seemed reasonable, and Dick resolved to adopt it. On the\nwhole, he began to think prospects were brighter than he had at\nfirst supposed, and his spirits rose a little.",
        "“How’d he know I had any bank-book? That’s what I can’t make out,\"\nhe said.",
        "“Don’t you remember?” said Fosdick, after a moment’s thought, “we\nwere speaking of our savings, two or three evenings since?”",
        "“Yes,” said Dick.",
        "“Our door was a little open at the time, and I heard somebody come\nupstairs, and stop a minute in front of it. It must have been Jim\nTravis. In that way he probably found out about your money, and took\nthe opportunity to-day to get hold of it.”",
        "This might or might not be the correct explanation. At all events it\nseemed probable.",
        "The boys were just on the point of going to bed, later in the\nevening, when a knock was heard at the door, and, to their no little\nsurprise, their neighbor, Jim Travis, proved to be the caller. He\nwas a sallow-complexioned young man, with dark hair and bloodshot\neyes.",
        "He darted a quick glance from one to the other as he entered, which\ndid not escape the boys’ notice.",
        "“How are ye, to-night?” he said, sinking into one of the two chairs\nwith which the room was scantily furnished.",
        "“Jolly,” said Dick. “How are you?”",
        "“Tired as a dog,” was the reply. “Hard work and poor pay; that’s the\nway with me. I wanted to go to the theater, to-night, but I was hard\nup, and couldn’t raise the cash.”",
        "Here he darted another quick glance at the boys; but neither\nbetrayed anything.",
        "“You don’t go out much, do you?” he said",
        "“Not much,” said Fosdick. “We spend our evenings in study.”",
        "“That’s precious slow,” said Travis, rather contemptuously. “What’s\nthe use of studying so much? You don’t expect to be a lawyer, do\nyou, or anything of that sort?”",
        "“Maybe,” said Dick. “I haven’t made up my mind yet. If my\nfeller-citizens should want me to go to Congress some time, I\nshouldn’t want to disapp’int ’em; and then readin’ and writin’\nmight come handy.”",
        "“Well,” said Travis, rather abruptly, “I’m tired and I guess\nI’ll turn in.”",
        "“Good-night,” said Fosdick.",
        "The boys looked at each other as their visitor left the room.",
        "“He came in to see if we’d missed the bank-book,” said Dick.",
        "“And to turn off suspicion from himself, by letting us know he had\nno money,” added Fosdick.",
        "“That’s so,” said Dick. “I’d like to have searched them pockets\nof his.”",
        "Fosdick was right in supposing that Jim Travis had stolen the\nbank-book. He was also right in supposing that that worthy young\nman had come to the knowledge of Dick’s savings by what he had\naccidentally overheard. Now, Travis, like a very large number of\nyoung men of his class, was able to dispose of a larger amount of\nmoney than he was able to earn. Moreover, he had no great fancy for\nwork at all, and would have been glad to find some other way of\nobtaining money enough to pay his expenses. He had recently received\na letter from an old companion, who had strayed out to California,\nand going at once to the mines had been lucky enough to get\npossession of a very remunerative claim. He wrote to Travis that he\nhad already realized two thousand dollars from it, and expected to\nmake his fortune within six months.",
        "Two thousand dollars! This seemed to Travis a very large sum, and\nquite dazzled his imagination. He was at once inflamed with the\ndesire to go out to California and try his luck. In his present\nsituation he only received thirty dollars a month, which was\nprobably all that his services were worth, but went a very little\nway towards gratifying his expensive tastes. Accordingly he\ndetermined to take the next steamer to the land of gold, if he\ncould possibly manage to get money enough to pay the passage.",
        "The price of a steerage passage at that time was seventy-five\ndollars,–not a large sum, certainly,–but it might as well have\nbeen seventy-five hundred for any chance James Travis had of raising\nthe amount at present. His available funds consisted of precisely\ntwo dollars and a quarter; of which sum, one dollar and a half was\ndue to his washerwoman. This, however, would not have troubled\nTravis much, and he would conveniently have forgotten all about it;\nbut, even leaving this debt unpaid, the sum at his command would not\nhelp him materially towards paying his passage money.",
        "Travis applied for help to two or three of his companions; but they\nwere all of that kind who never keep an account with savings banks,\nbut carry all their spare cash about with them. One of these friends\noffered to lend him thirty-seven cents, and another a dollar; but\nneither of these offers seemed to encourage him much. He was about\ngiving up his project in despair, when he learned, accidentally, as\nwe have already said, the extent of Dick’s savings.",
        "One hundred and seventeen dollars! Why, that would not only pay his\npassage, but carry him up to the mines, after he had arrived in San\nFrancisco. He could not help thinking it over, and the result of\nthis thinking was that he determined to borrow it of Dick without\nleave. Knowing that neither of the boys were in their room in the\ndaytime, he came back in the course of the morning, and, being\nadmitted by Mrs. Mooney herself, said, by way of accounting for his\npresence, that he had a cold, and had come back for a handkerchief.\nThe landlady suspected nothing, and, returning at once to her work\nin the kitchen, left the coast clear.",
        "Travis at once entered Dick’s room, and, as there seemed to be no\nother place for depositing money, tried the bureau-drawers. They\nwere all readily opened, except one, which proved to be locked. This\nhe naturally concluded must contain the money, and going back to his\nown chamber for the key of the bureau, tried it on his return, and\nfound to his satisfaction that it would fit. When he discovered the\nbank-book, his joy was mingled with disappointment. He had expected\nto find bank-bills instead. This would have saved all further\ntrouble, and would have been immediately available. Obtaining money\nat the savings bank would involve fresh risk. Travis hesitated\nwhether to take it or not; but finally decided that it would be\nworth the trouble and hazard.",
        "He accordingly slipped the book into his pocket, locked the drawer\nagain, and, forgetting all about the handkerchief for which he had\ncome home went downstairs, and into the street.",
        "There would have been time to go to the savings bank that day, but\nTravis had already been absent from his place of business some time,\nand did not venture to take the additional time required. Besides,\nnot being very much used to savings banks, never having had occasion\nto use them, he thought it would be more prudent to look over the\nrules and regulations, and see if he could not get some information\nas to the way he ought to proceed. So the day passed, and Dick’s\nmoney was left in safety at the bank.",
        "In the evening, it occurred to Travis that it might be well to find\nout whether Dick had discovered his loss. This reflection it was\nthat induced the visit which is recorded at the close of the last\nchapter. The result was that he was misled by the boys’ silence on\nthe subject, and concluded that nothing had yet been discovered.",
        "“Good!” thought Travis, with satisfaction. “If they don’t find out\nfor twenty-four hours, it’ll be too late, then, and I shall be all\nright.”",
        "There being a possibility of the loss being discovered before the\nboys went out in the morning, Travis determined to see them at that\ntime, and judge whether such was the case. He waited, therefore,\nuntil he heard the boys come out, and then opened his own door.",
        "“Morning, gents,” said he, sociably. “Going to business?”",
        "“Yes,” said Dick. “I’m afraid my clerks’ll be lazy if I aint\non hand.”",
        "“Good joke!” said Travis. “If you pay good wages, I’d like to speak\nfor a place.”",
        "“I pay all I get myself,” said Dick. “How’s business with you?”",
        "“So so. Why don’t you call round, some time?”",
        "“All my evenin’s is devoted to literatoor and science,” said Dick.\n\"Thank you all the same.”",
        "“Where do you hang out?” inquired Travis, in choice language,\naddressing Fosdick.",
        "“At Henderson’s hat and cap store, on Broadway.”",
        "“I’ll look in upon you some time when I want a tile,” said Travis.\n\"I suppose you sell cheaper to your friends.”",
        "“I’ll be as reasonable as I can,” said Fosdick, not very cordially;\nfor he did not much fancy having it supposed by his employer that\nsuch a disreputable-looking person as Travis was a friend of his.",
        "However, Travis had no idea of showing himself at the Broadway\nstore, and only said this by way of making conversation, and\nencouraging the boys to be social.",
        "“You haven’t any of you gents seen a pearl-handled knife, have you?\"\nhe asked.",
        "“No,” said Fosdick; “have you lost one?”",
        "“Yes,” said Travis, with unblushing falsehood. “I left it on my\nbureau a day or two since. I’ve missed one or two other little\nmatters. Bridget don’t look to me any too honest. Likely she’s\ngot ’em.”",
        "“What are you goin’ to do about it?” said Dick.",
        "“I’ll keep mum unless I lose something more, and then I’ll kick up a\nrow, and haul her over the coals. Have you missed anything?”",
        "“No,” said Fosdick, answering for himself, as he could do without\nviolating the truth.",
        "There was a gleam of satisfaction in the eyes of Travis, as he heard\nthis.",
        "“They haven’t found it out yet,” he thought. “I’ll bag the money\nto-day, and then they may whistle for it.”",
        "Having no further object to serve in accompanying the boys, he bade\nthem good-morning, and turned down another street.",
        "“He’s mighty friendly all of a sudden,” said Dick.",
        "“Yes,” said Fosdick; “it’s very evident what it all means. He wants\nto find out whether you have discovered your loss or not.”",
        "“But he didn’t find out.”",
        "“No; we’ve put him on the wrong track. He means to get his money\nto-day, no doubt.”",
        "“My money,” suggested Dick.",
        "“I accept the correction,” said Fosdick.",
        "“Of course, Dick, you’ll be on hand as soon as the bank opens.”",
        "“In course I shall. Jim Travis’ll find he’s walked into the\nwrong shop.”",
        "“The bank opens at ten o’clock, you know.”",
        "“I’ll be there on time.”",
        "The two boys separated.",
        "“Good luck, Dick,” said Fosdick, as he parted from him. “It’ll all\ncome out right, I think.”",
        "“I hope ’twill,” said Dick.",
        "He had recovered from his temporary depression, and made up his mind\nthat the money would be recovered. He had no idea of allowing\nhimself to be outwitted by Jim Travis, and enjoyed already, in\nanticipation, the pleasure of defeating his rascality.",
        "It wanted two hours and a half yet to ten o’clock, and this time to\nDick was too precious to be wasted. It was the time of his greatest\nharvest. He accordingly repaired to his usual place of business,\nsucceeded in obtaining six customers, which yielded him sixty cents.\nHe then went to a restaurant, and got some breakfast. It was now\nhalf-past nine, and Dick, feeling that it wouldn’t do to be late,\nleft his box in charge of Johnny Nolan, and made his way to the\nbank.",
        "The officers had not yet arrived, and Dick lingered on the outside,\nwaiting till they should come. He was not without a little\nuneasiness, fearing that Travis might be as prompt as himself, and\nfinding him there, might suspect something, and so escape the snare.\nBut, though looking cautiously up and down the street, he could\ndiscover no traces of the supposed thief. In due time ten o’clock\nstruck, and immediately afterwards the doors of the bank were thrown\nopen, and our hero entered.",
        "As Dick had been in the habit of making a weekly visit for the last\nnine months, the cashier had come to know him by sight.",
        "“You’re early, this morning, my lad,” he said, pleasantly. “Have you\ngot some more money to deposit? You’ll be getting rich, soon.”",
        "“I don’t know about that,” said Dick. “My bank-book’s been stole.”",
        "“Stolen!” echoed the cashier. “That’s unfortunate. Not so bad as it\nmight be, though. The thief can’t collect the money.”",
        "“That’s what I came to see about,” said Dick. “I was afraid he might\nhave got it already.”",
        "“He hasn’t been here yet. Even if he had, I remember you, and should\nhave detected him. When was it taken?”",
        "“Yesterday,” said Dick. “I missed it in the evenin’ when I\ngot home.”",
        "“Have you any suspicion as to the person who took it?” asked\nthe cashier.",
        "Dick thereupon told all he knew as to the general character and\nsuspicious conduct of Jim Travis, and the cashier agreed with him\nthat he was probably the thief. Dick also gave his reason for\nthinking that he would visit the bank that morning, to withdraw\nthe funds.",
        "“Very good,” said the cashier. “We’ll be ready for him. What is the\nnumber of your book?”",
        "“No. 5,678,” said Dick.",
        "“Now give me a little description of this Travis whom you suspect.”",
        "Dick accordingly furnished a brief outline sketch of Travis, not\nparticularly complimentary to the latter.",
        "“That will answer. I think I shall know him,” said the cashier. “You\nmay depend upon it that he shall receive no money on your account.”",
        "“Thank you,” said Dick.",
        "Considerably relieved in mind, our hero turned towards the door,\nthinking that there would be nothing gained by his remaining longer,\nwhile he would of course lose time.",
        "He had just reached the doors, which were of glass, when through\nthem he perceived James Travis himself just crossing the street, and\napparently coming towards the bank. It would not do, of course, for\nhim to be seen.",
        "“Here he is,” he exclaimed, hurrying back. “Can’t you hide me\nsomewhere? I don’t want to be seen.”",
        "The cashier understood at once how the land lay. He quickly opened a\nlittle door, and admitted Dick behind the counter.",
        "“Stoop down,” he said, “so as not to be seen.”",
        "Dick had hardly done so when Jim Travis opened the outer door,\nand, looking about him in a little uncertainty, walked up to the\ncashier’s desk.",
        "Jim Travis advanced into the bank with a doubtful step, knowing well\nthat he was on a dishonest errand, and heartily wishing that he\nwere well out of it. After a little hesitation, he approached the\npaying-teller, and, exhibiting the bank-book, said, “I want to get\nmy money out.”",
        "The bank-officer took the book, and, after looking at it a moment,\nsaid, “How much do you want?”",
        "“The whole of it,” said Travis.",
        "“You can draw out any part of it, but to draw out the whole requires\na week’s notice.”",
        "“Then I’ll take a hundred dollars.”",
        "“Are you the person to whom the book belongs?”",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Travis, without hesitation.",
        "“Your name is–”",
        "“Hunter.”",
        "The bank-clerk went to a large folio volume, containing the names of\ndepositors, and began to turn over the leaves. While he was doing\nthis, he managed to send out a young man connected with the bank for\na policeman. Travis did not perceive this, or did not suspect that\nit had anything to do with himself. Not being used to savings banks,\nhe supposed the delay only what was usual. After a search, which was\nonly intended to gain time that a policeman might be summoned, the\ncashier came back, and, sliding out a piece of paper to Travis,\nsaid, “It will be necessary for you to write an order for the money.”",
        "Travis took a pen, which he found on the ledge outside, and wrote\nthe order, signing his name “Dick Hunter,” having observed that name\non the outside of the book.",
        "“Your name is Dick Hunter, then?” said the cashier, taking the\npaper, and looking at the thief over his spectacles.",
        "“Yes,” said Travis, promptly.",
        "“But,” continued the cashier, “I find Hunter’s age is put down on\nthe bank-book as fourteen. Surely you must be more than that.”",
        "Travis would gladly have declared that he was only fourteen; but,\nbeing in reality twenty-three, and possessing a luxuriant pair of\nwhiskers, this was not to be thought of. He began to feel uneasy.",
        "“Dick Hunter’s my younger brother,” he said. “I’m getting out the\nmoney for him.”",
        "“I thought you said your own name was Dick Hunter,” said the cashier.",
        "“I said my name was Hunter,” said Travis, ingeniously. “I didn’t\nunderstand you.”",
        "“But you’ve signed the name of Dick Hunter to this order. How is\nthat?” questioned the troublesome cashier.",
        "Travis saw that he was getting himself into a tight place; but his\nself-possession did not desert him.",
        "“I thought I must give my brother’s name,” he answered.",
        "“What is your own name?”",
        "“Henry Hunter.”",
        "“Can you bring any one to testify that the statement you are\nmaking is correct?”",
        "“Yes, a dozen if you like,” said Travis, boldly. “Give me the book,\nand I’ll come back this afternoon. I didn’t think there’d be such a\nfuss about getting out a little money.”",
        "“Wait a moment. Why don’t your brother come himself?”",
        "“Because he’s sick. He’s down with the measles,” said Travis.",
        "Here the cashier signed to Dick to rise and show himself. Our hero\naccordingly did so.",
        "“You will be glad to find that he has recovered,” said the cashier,\npointing to Dick.",
        "With an exclamation of anger and dismay, Travis, who saw the game\nwas up, started for the door, feeling that safety made such a course\nprudent. But he was too late. He found himself confronted by a burly\npoliceman, who seized him by the arm, saying, “Not so fast, my man.\nI want you.”",
        "“Let me go,” exclaimed Travis, struggling to free himself.",
        "“I’m sorry I can’t oblige you,” said the officer. “You’d better not\nmake a fuss, or I may have to hurt you a little.”",
        "Travis sullenly resigned himself to his fate, darting a look of rage\nat Dick, whom he considered the author of his present misfortune.",
        "“This is your book,” said the cashier, handing back his rightful\nproperty to our hero. “Do you wish to draw out any money?”",
        "“Two dollars,” said Dick.",
        "“Very well. Write an order for the amount.”",
        "Before doing so, Dick, who now that he saw Travis in the power of\nthe law began to pity him, went up to the officer, and said,–",
        "“Won’t you let him go? I’ve got my bank-book back, and I don’t want\nanything done to him.”",
        "“Sorry I can’t oblige you,” said the officer; “but I’m not allowed\nto do it. He’ll have to stand his trial.”",
        "“I’m sorry for you, Travis,” said Dick. “I didn’t want you arrested.\nI only wanted my bank-book back.”",
        "“Curse you!” said Travis, scowling vindictively. “Wait till I get\nfree. See if I don’t fix you.”",
        "“You needn’t pity him too much,” said the officer. “I know him now.\nHe’s been to the Island before.”",
        "“It’s a lie,” said Travis, violently.",
        "“Don’t be too noisy, my friend,” said the officer. “If you’ve got no\nmore business here, we’ll be going.”",
        "He withdrew with the prisoner in charge, and Dick, having drawn his\ntwo dollars, left the bank. Notwithstanding the violent words the\nprisoner had used towards himself, and his attempted robbery, he\ncould not help feeling sorry that he had been instrumental in\ncausing his arrest.",
        "“I’ll keep my book a little safer hereafter,” thought Dick. “Now I\nmust go and see Tom Wilkins.”",
        "Before dismissing the subject of Travis and his theft, it may be\nremarked that he was duly tried, and, his guilt being clear, was\nsent to Blackwell’s Island for nine months. At the end of that time,\non his release, he got a chance to work his passage on a ship to\nSan Francisco, where he probably arrived in due time. At any rate,\nnothing more has been heard of him, and probably his threat of\nvengence against Dick will never be carried into effect.",
        "Returning to the City Hall Park, Dick soon fell in with Tom Wilkins.",
        "“How are you, Tom?” he said. “How’s your mother?”",
        "“She’s better, Dick, thank you. She felt worried about bein’ turned\nout into the street; but I gave her that money from you, and now she\nfeels a good deal easier.”",
        "“I’ve got some more for you, Tom,” said Dick, producing a two-dollar\nbill from his pocket.",
        "“I ought not to take it from you, Dick.”",
        "“Oh, it’s all right, Tom. Don’t be afraid.”",
        "“But you may need it yourself.”",
        "“There’s plenty more where that came from.”",
        "“Any way, one dollar will be enough. With that we can pay the rent.”",
        "“You’ll want the other to buy something to eat.”",
        "“You’re very kind, Dick.”",
        "“I’d ought to be. I’ve only got myself to take care of.”",
        "“Well, I’ll take it for my mother’s sake. When you want anything\ndone just call on Tom Wilkins.”",
        "“All right. Next week, if your mother doesn’t get better, I’ll give\nyou some more.”",
        "Tom thanked our hero very gratefully, and Dick walked away,\nfeeling the self-approval which always accompanies a generous and\ndisinterested action. He was generous by nature, and, before\nthe period at which he is introduced to the reader’s notice, he\nfrequently treated his friends to cigars and oyster-stews. Sometimes\nhe invited them to accompany him to the theatre at his expense. But\nhe never derived from these acts of liberality the same degree of\nsatisfaction as from this timely gift to Tom Wilkins. He felt that\nhis money was well bestowed, and would save an entire family from\nprivation and discomfort. Five dollars would, to be sure, make\nsomething of a difference in the mount of his savings. It was more\nthan he was able to save up in a week. But Dick felt fully repaid\nfor what he had done, and he felt prepared to give as much more,\nif Tom’s mother should continue to be sick, and should appear to\nhim to need it.",
        "Besides all this, Dick felt a justifiable pride in his financial\nability to afford so handsome a gift. A year before, however much\nhe might have desired to give, it would have been quite out of his\npower to give five dollars. His cash balance never reached that\namount. It was seldom, indeed, that it equalled one dollar. In\nmore ways than one Dick was beginning to reap the advantage of his\nself-denial and judicious economy.",
        "It will be remembered that when Mr. Whitney at parting with Dick\npresented him with five dollars, he told him that he might repay it\nto some other boy who was struggling upward. Dick thought of this,\nand it occurred to him that after all he was only paying up an old\ndebt.",
        "When Fosdick came home in the evening, Dick announced his success\nin recovering his lost money, and described the manner it had been\nbrought about.",
        "“You’re in luck,” said Fosdick. “I guess we’d better not trust the\nbureau-drawer again.”",
        "“I mean to carry my book round with me,” said Dick.",
        "“So shall I, as long as we stay at Mrs. Mooney’s. I wish we were in\na better place.”",
        "“I must go down and tell her she needn’t expect Travis back. Poor\nchap, I pity him!”",
        "Travis was never more seen in Mrs. Mooney’s establishment. He was\nowing that lady for a fortnight’s rent of his room, which prevented\nher feeling much compassion for him. The room was soon after let to\na more creditable tenant who proved a less troublesome neighbor than\nhis predecessor.",
        "It was about a week after Dick’s recovery of his bank-book, that\nFosdick brought home with him in the evening a copy of the “Daily\nSun.”",
        "“Would you like to see your name in print, Dick?” he asked.",
        "“Yes,” said Dick, who was busy at the wash-stand, endeavoring to\nefface the marks which his day’s work had left upon his hands. “They\nhaven’t put me up for mayor, have they? ’Cause if they have, I\nshan’t accept. It would interfere too much with my private business.”",
        "“No,” said Fosdick, “they haven’t put you up for office yet, though\nthat may happen sometime. But if you want to see your name in print,\nhere it is.”",
        "Dick was rather incredulous, but, having dried his hands on the\ntowel, took the paper, and following the directions of Fosdick’s\nfinger, observed in the list of advertised letters the name of\n\"RAGGED DICK.”",
        "“By gracious, so it is,” said he. “Do you s’pose it means me?”",
        "“I don’t know of any other Ragged Dick,–do you?”",
        "“No,” said Dick, reflectively; “it must be me. But I don’t know of\nanybody that would be likely to write to me.”",
        "“Perhaps it is Frank Whitney,” suggested Fosdick, after a little\nreflection. “Didn’t he promise to write to you?”",
        "“Yes,” said Dick, “and he wanted me to write to him.”",
        "“Where is he now?”",
        "“He was going to a boarding-school in Connecticut, he said. The name\nof the town was Barnton.”",
        "“Very likely the letter is from him.”",
        "“I hope it is. Frank was a tip-top boy, and he was the first that\nmade me ashamed of bein’ so ignorant and dirty.”",
        "“You had better go to the post-office to-morrow morning, and ask for\nthe letter.”",
        "“P’r’aps they won’t give it to me.”",
        "“Suppose you wear the old clothes you used to a year ago, when Frank\nfirst saw you? They won’t have any doubt of your being Ragged Dick\nthen.”",
        "“I guess I will. I’ll be sort of ashamed to be seen in ’em though,\"\nsaid Dick, who had considerable more pride in a neat personal\nappearance than when we were first introduced to him.",
        "“It will be only for one day, or one morning,” said Fosdick.",
        "“I’d do more’n that for the sake of gettin’ a letter from Frank. I’d\nlike to see him.”",
        "The next morning, in accordance with the suggestion of Fosdick, Dick\narrayed himself in the long disused Washington coat and Napoleon\npants, which he had carefully preserved, for what reason he could\nhardly explain.",
        "When fairly equipped, Dick surveyed himself in the mirror,–if the\nlittle seven-by-nine-inch looking-glass, with which the room was\nfurnished, deserved the name. The result of the survey was not on\nthe whole a pleasing one. To tell the truth, Dick was quite ashamed\nof his appearance, and, on opening the chamber-door, looked around\nto see that the coast was clear, not being willing to have any of\nhis fellow-boarders see him in his present attire.",
        "He managed to slip out into the street unobserved, and, after\nattending to two or three regular customers who came down-town\nearly in the morning, he made his way down Nassau Street to the\npost-office. He passed along until he came to a compartment on\nwhich he read ADVERTISED LETTERS, and, stepping up to the little\nwindow, said,–",
        "“There’s a letter for me. I saw it advertised in the ’Sun’\nyesterday.”",
        "“What name?” demanded the clerk.",
        "“Ragged Dick,” answered our hero.",
        "“That’s a queer name,” said the clerk, surveying him a little\ncuriously. “Are you Ragged Dick?”",
        "“If you don’t believe me, look at my clo’es,” said Dick.",
        "“That’s pretty good proof, certainly,” said the clerk, laughing. “If\nthat isn’t your name, it deserves to be.”",
        "“I believe in dressin’ up to your name,” said Dick.",
        "“Do you know any one in Barnton, Connecticut?” asked the clerk, who\nhad by this time found the letter.",
        "“Yes,” said Dick. “I know a chap that’s at boardin’-school there.”",
        "“It appears to be in a boy’s hand. I think it must be yours.”",
        "The letter was handed to Dick through the window. He received it\neagerly, and drawing back so as not to be in the way of the throng\nwho were constantly applying for letters, or slipping them into the\nboxes provided for them, hastily opened it, and began to read. As\nthe reader may be interested in the contents of the letter as well\nas Dick, we transcribe it below.",
        "It was dated Barnton, Conn., and commenced thus,–",
        "“DEAR DICK,–You must excuse my addressing this letter to ’Ragged\nDick’; but the fact is, I don’t know what your last name is, nor\nwhere you live. I am afraid there is not much chance of your getting\nthis letter; but I hope you will. I have thought of you very often,\nand wondered how you were getting along, and I should have written\nto you before if I had known where to direct.",
        "“Let me tell you a little about myself. Barnton is a very\npretty country town, only about six miles from Hartford. The\nboarding-school which I attend is under the charge of Ezekiel\nMunroe, A.M. He is a man of about fifty, a graduate of Yale College,\nand has always been a teacher. It is a large two-story house, with\nan addition containing a good many small bed-chambers for the boys.\nThere are about twenty of us, and there is one assistant teacher who\nteaches the English branches. Mr. Munroe, or Old Zeke, as we call\nhim behind his back, teaches Latin and Greek. I am studying both\nthese languages, because father wants me to go to college.",
        "“But you won’t be interested in hearing about our studies. I will\ntell you how we amuse ourselves. There are about fifty acres of land\nbelonging to Mr. Munroe; so that we have plenty of room for play.\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the house there is a good-sized pond.\nThere is a large, round-bottomed boat, which is stout and strong.\nEvery Wednesday and Saturday afternoon, when the weather is good, we\ngo out rowing on the pond. Mr. Barton, the assistant teacher, goes\nwith us, to look after us. In the summer we are allowed to go in\nbathing. In the winter there is splendid skating on the pond.",
        "“Besides this, we play ball a good deal, and we have various other\nplays. So we have a pretty good time, although we study pretty hard\ntoo. I am getting on very well in my studies. Father has not decided\nyet where he will send me to college.",
        "“I wish you were here, Dick. I should enjoy your company, and\nbesides I should like to feel that you were getting an education. I\nthink you are naturally a pretty smart boy; but I suppose, as you\nhave to earn your own living, you don’t get much chance to learn. I\nonly wish I had a few hundred dollars of my own. I would have you\ncome up here, and attend school with us. If I ever have a chance to\nhelp you in any way, you may be sure that I will.",
        "“I shall have to wind up my letter now, as I have to hand in a\ncomposition to-morrow, on the life and character of Washington. I\nmight say that I have a friend who wears a coat that once belonged\nto the general. But I suppose that coat must be worn out by this\ntime. I don’t much like writing compositions. I would a good deal\nrather write letters.",
        "“I have written a longer letter than I meant to. I hope you will get\nit, though I am afraid not. If you do, you must be sure to answer\nit, as soon as possible. You needn’t mind if your writing does look\nlike ’hens-tracks,’ as you told me once.",
        "“Good-by, Dick. You must always think of me, as your very true\nfriend,",
        "“Frank Whitney.”",
        "Dick read this letter with much satisfaction. It is always pleasant\nto be remembered, and Dick had so few friends that it was more to\nhim than to boys who are better provided. Again, he felt a new sense\nof importance in having a letter addressed to him. It was the first\nletter he had ever received. If it had been sent to him a year\nbefore, he would not have been able to read it. But now, thanks to\nFosdick’s instructions, he could not only read writing, but he could\nwrite a very good hand himself.",
        "There was one passage in the letter which pleased Dick. It was where\nFrank said that if he had the money he would pay for his education\nhimself.",
        "“He’s a tip-top feller,” said Dick. “I wish I could see him ag’in.”",
        "There were two reasons why Dick would like to have seen Frank. One\nwas, the natural pleasure he would have in meeting a friend; but he\nfelt also that he would like to have Frank witness the improvement\nhe had made in his studies and mode of life.",
        "“He’d find me a little more ’spectable than when he first saw me,\"\nthought Dick.",
        "Dick had by this time got up to Printing House Square. Standing on\nSpruce Street, near the “Tribune” office, was his old enemy, Micky\nMaguire.",
        "It has already been said that Micky felt a natural enmity towards\nthose in his own condition in life who wore better clothes than\nhimself. For the last nine months, Dick’s neat appearance had\nexcited the ire of the young Philistine. To appear in neat attire\nand with a clean face Micky felt was a piece of presumption, and an\nassumption of superiority on the part of our hero, and he termed it\n\"tryin’ to be a swell.”",
        "Now his astonished eyes rested on Dick in his ancient attire, which\nwas very similar to his own. It was a moment of triumph to him. He\nfelt that “pride had had a fall,” and he could not forbear reminding\nDick of it.",
        "“Them’s nice clo’es you’ve got on,” said he, sarcastically, as Dick\ncame up.",
        "“Yes,” said Dick, promptly. “I’ve been employin’ your tailor. If my\nface was only dirty we’d be taken for twin brothers.”",
        "“So you’ve give up tryin’ to be a swell?”",
        "“Only for this partic’lar occasion,” said Dick. “I wanted to make a\nfashionable call, so I put on my regimentals.”",
        "“I don’t b’lieve you’ve got any better clo’es,” said Micky.",
        "“All right,” said Dick, “I won’t charge you nothin’ for what you\nbelieve.”",
        "Here a customer presented himself for Micky, and Dick went back to\nhis room to change his clothes, before resuming business.",
        "When Fosdick reached home in the evening, Dick displayed his letter\nwith some pride.",
        "“It’s a nice letter,” said Fosdick, after reading it “I should like\nto know Frank.”",
        "“I’ll bet you would,” said Dick. “He’s a trump.”",
        "“When are you going to answer it?”",
        "“I don’t know,” said Dick, dubiously. “I never writ a letter.”",
        "“That’s no reason why you shouldn’t. There’s always a first time,\nyou know.”",
        "“I don’t know what to say,” said Dick.",
        "“Get some paper and sit down to it, and you’ll find enough to say.\nYou can do that this evening instead of studying.”",
        "“If you’ll look it over afterwards, and shine it up a little.”",
        "“Yes, if it needs it; but I rather think Frank would like it best\njust as you wrote it.”",
        "Dick decided to adopt Fosdick’s suggestion. He had very serious\ndoubts as to his ability to write a letter. Like a good many other\nboys, he looked upon it as a very serious job, not reflecting that,\nafter all, letter-writing is nothing but talking upon paper. Still,\nin spite of his misgivings, he felt that the letter ought to be\nanswered, and he wished Frank to hear from him. After various\npreparations, he at last got settled down to his task, and, before\nthe evening was over, a letter was written. As the first letter\nwhich Dick had ever produced, and because it was characteristic\nof him, my readers may like to read it.",
        "Here it is,–",
        "“DEAR FRANK,–I got your letter this mornin’, and was very glad to\nhear you hadn’t forgotten Ragged Dick. I aint so ragged as I was.\nOpenwork coats and trowsers has gone out of fashion. I put on the\nWashington coat and Napoleon pants to go to the post-office, for\nfear they wouldn’t think I was the boy that was meant. On my way\nback I received the congratulations of my intimate friend, Micky\nMaguire, on my improved appearance.",
        "“I’ve give up sleepin’ in boxes, and old wagons, findin’ it didn’t\nagree with my constitution. I’ve hired a room in Mott Street, and\nhave got a private tooter, who rooms with me and looks after my\nstudies in the evenin’. Mott Street aint very fashionable; but my\nmanshun on Fifth Avenoo isn’t finished yet, and I’m afraid it won’t\nbe till I’m a gray-haired veteran. I’ve got a hundred dollars\ntowards it, which I’ve saved up from my earnin’s. I haven’t forgot\nwhat you and your uncle said to me, and I’m tryin’ to grow up\n’spectable. I haven’t been to Tony Pastor’s, or the Old Bowery, for\never so long. I’d rather save up my money to support me in my old\nage. When my hair gets gray, I’m goin’ to knock off blackin’ boots,\nand go into some light, genteel employment, such as keepin’ an\napple-stand, or disseminatin’ pea-nuts among the people.",
        "“I’ve got so as to read pretty well, so my tooter says. I’ve been\nstudyin’ geography and grammar also. I’ve made such astonishin’\nprogress that I can tell a noun from a conjunction as far away as\nI can see ’em. Tell Mr. Munroe that if he wants an accomplished\nteacher in his school, he can send for me, and I’ll come on by the\nvery next train. Or, if he wants to sell out for a hundred dollars,\nI’ll buy the whole concern, and agree to teach the scholars all I\nknow myself in less than six months. Is teachin’ as good business,\ngenerally speakin’, as blackin’ boots? My private tooter combines\nboth, and is makin’ a fortun’ with great rapidity. He’ll be as rich\nas Astor some time, if he only lives long enough.\n\"I should think you’d have a bully time at your school. I should\nlike to go out in the boat, or play ball with you. When are you\ncomin’ to the city? I wish you’d write and let me know when you do,\nand I’ll call and see you. I’ll leave my business in the hands of my\nnumerous clerks, and go round with you. There’s lots of things you\ndidn’t see when you was here before. They’re getting on fast at the\nCentral Park. It looks better than it did a year ago.",
        "“I aint much used to writin’ letters. As this is the first one I\never wrote, I hope you’ll excuse the mistakes. I hope you’ll write\nto me again soon. I can’t write so good a letter as you; but, I’ll\ndo my best, as the man said when he was asked if he could swim over\nto Brooklyn backwards. Good-by, Frank. Thank you for all your\nkindness. Direct your next letter to No. – Mott Street.",
        "  “Your true friend,\n  “DICK HUNTER,”",
        "When Dick had written the last word, he leaned back in his chair,\nand surveyed the letter with much satisfaction.",
        "“I didn’t think I could have wrote such a long letter, Fosdick,\"\nsaid he.",
        "“Written would be more grammatical, Dick,” suggested his friend.",
        "“I guess there’s plenty of mistakes in it,” said Dick. “Just look at\nit, and see.”",
        "Fosdick took the letter, and read it over carefully.",
        "“Yes, there are some mistakes,” he said; “but it sounds so much like\nyou that I think it would be better to let it go just as it is. It\nwill be more likely to remind Frank of what you were when he first\nsaw you.”",
        "“Is it good enough to send?” asked Dick, anxiously.",
        "“Yes; it seems to me to be quite a good letter. It is written just\nas you talk. Nobody but you could have written such a letter, Dick.\nI think Frank will be amused at your proposal to come up there as\nteacher.”",
        "“P’r’aps it would be a good idea for us to open a seleck school here\nin Mott Street,” said Dick, humorously. “We could call it ’Professor\nFosdick and Hunter’s Mott Street Seminary.’ Boot-blackin’ taught by\nProfessor Hunter.”",
        "The evening was so far advanced that Dick decided to postpone\ncopying his letter till the next evening. By this time he had come\nto have a very fair handwriting, so that when the letter was\ncomplete it really looked quite creditable, and no one would have\nsuspected that it was Dick’s first attempt in this line. Our hero\nsurveyed it with no little complacency. In fact, he felt rather\nproud of it, since it reminded him of the great progress he had\nmade. He carried it down to the post-office, and deposited it with\nhis own hands in the proper box. Just on the steps of the building,\nas he was coming out, he met Johnny Nolan, who had been sent on an\nerrand to Wall Street by some gentleman, and was just returning.",
        "“What are you doin’ down here, Dick?” asked Johnny.",
        "“I’ve been mailin’ a letter.”",
        "“Who sent you?”",
        "“Nobody.”",
        "“I mean, who writ the letter?”",
        "“I wrote it myself.”",
        "“Can you write letters?” asked Johnny, in amazement.",
        "“Why shouldn’t I?”",
        "“I didn’t know you could write. I can’t.”",
        "“Then you ought to learn.”",
        "“I went to school once; but it was too hard work, so I give it up.”",
        "“You’re lazy, Johnny,–that’s what’s the matter. How’d you ever\nexpect to know anything, if you don’t try?”",
        "“I can’t learn.”",
        "“You can, if you want to.”",
        "Johnny Nolan was evidently of a different opinion. He was a\ngood-natured boy, large of his age, with nothing particularly bad\nabout him, but utterly lacking in that energy, ambition, and natural\nsharpness, for which Dick was distinguished. He was not adapted to\nsucceed in the life which circumstances had forced upon him; for in\nthe street-life of the metropolis a boy needs to be on the alert,\nand have all his wits about him, or he will find himself wholly\ndistanced by his more enterprising competitors for popular favor. To\nsucceed in his profession, humble as it is, a boot-black must depend\nupon the same qualities which gain success in higher walks in\nlife. It was easy to see that Johnny, unless very much favored by\ncircumstances, would never rise much above his present level. For\nDick, we cannot help hoping much better things.",
        "Dick now began to look about for a position in a store or\ncounting-room. Until he should obtain one he determined to devote\nhalf the day to blacking boots, not being willing to break in upon\nhis small capital. He found that he could earn enough in half a day\nto pay all his necessary expenses, including the entire rent of the\nroom. Fosdick desired to pay his half; but Dick steadily refused,\ninsisting upon paying so much as compensation for his friend’s\nservices as instructor.",
        "It should be added that Dick’s peculiar way of speaking and use of\nslang terms had been somewhat modified by his education and his\nintimacy with Henry Fosdick. Still he continued to indulge in them\nto some extent, especially when he felt like joking, and it was\nnatural to Dick to joke, as my readers have probably found out by\nthis time. Still his manners were considerably improved, so that he\nwas more likely to obtain a situation than when first introduced\nto our notice.",
        "Just now, however, business was very dull, and merchants, instead of\nhiring new assistants, were disposed to part with those already in\ntheir employ. After making several ineffectual applications, Dick\nbegan to think he should be obliged to stick to his profession until\nthe next season. But about this time something occurred which\nconsiderably improved his chances of preferment.",
        "This is the way it happened.",
        "As Dick, with a balance of more than a hundred dollars in the\nsavings bank, might fairly consider himself a young man of property,\nhe thought himself justified in occasionally taking a half holiday\nfrom business, and going on an excursion. On Wednesday afternoon\nHenry Fosdick was sent by his employer on an errand to that part of\nBrooklyn near Greenwood Cemetery. Dick hastily dressed himself in\nhis best, and determined to accompany him.",
        "The two boys walked down to the South Ferry, and, paying their two\ncents each, entered the ferry boat. They remained at the stern, and\nstood by the railing, watching the great city, with its crowded\nwharves, receding from view. Beside them was a gentleman with two\nchildren,–a girl of eight and a little boy of six. The children\nwere talking gayly to their father. While he was pointing out some\nobject of interest to the little girl, the boy managed to creep,\nunobserved, beneath the chain that extends across the boat, for the\nprotection of passengers, and, stepping incautiously to the edge\nof the boat, fell over into the foaming water.",
        "At the child’s scream, the father looked up, and, with a cry of\nhorror, sprang to the edge of the boat. He would have plunged in,\nbut, being unable to swim, would only have endangered his own life,\nwithout being able to save his child.",
        "“My child!” he exclaimed in anguish,–\"who will save my child? A\nthousand–ten thousand dollars to any one who will save him!”",
        "There chanced to be but few passengers on board at the time, and\nnearly all these were either in the cabins or standing forward.\nAmong the few who saw the child fall was our hero.",
        "Now Dick was an expert swimmer. It was an accomplishment which he\nhad possessed for years, and he no sooner saw the boy fall than he\nresolved to rescue him. His determination was formed before he heard\nthe liberal offer made by the boy’s father. Indeed, I must do Dick\nthe justice to say that, in the excitement of the moment, he did not\nhear it at all, nor would it have stimulated the alacrity with which\nhe sprang to the rescue of the little boy.",
        "Little Johnny had already risen once, and gone under for the second\ntime, when our hero plunged in. He was obliged to strike out for\nthe boy, and this took time. He reached him none too soon. Just as\nhe was sinking for the third and last time, he caught him by the\njacket. Dick was stout and strong, but Johnny clung to him so\ntightly, that it was with great difficulty he was able to sustain\nhimself.",
        "“Put your arms round my neck,” said Dick.",
        "The little boy mechanically obeyed, and clung with a grasp\nstrengthened by his terror. In this position Dick could bear his\nweight better. But the ferry-boat was receding fast. It was quite\nimpossible to reach it. The father, his face pale with terror and\nanguish, and his hands clasped in suspense, saw the brave boy’s\nstruggles, and prayed with agonizing fervor that he might be\nsuccessful. But it is probable, for they were now midway of the\nriver, that both Dick and the little boy whom he had bravely\nundertaken to rescue would have been drowned, had not a row-boat\nbeen fortunately near. The two men who were in it witnessed the\naccident, and hastened to the rescue of our hero.",
        "“Keep up a little longer,” they shouted, bending to their oars,\n\"and we will save you.”",
        "Dick heard the shout, and it put fresh strength into him. He battled\nmanfully with the treacherous sea, his eyes fixed longingly upon the\napproaching boat.",
        "“Hold on tight, little boy,” he said. “There’s a boat coming.”",
        "The little boy did not see the boat. His eyes were closed to shut\nout the fearful water, but he clung the closer to his young\npreserver. Six long, steady strokes, and the boat dashed along side.\nStrong hands seized Dick and his youthful burden, and drew them into\nthe boat, both dripping with water.",
        "“God be thanked!” exclaimed the father, as from the steamer he saw\nthe child’s rescue. “That brave boy shall be rewarded, if I\nsacrifice my whole fortune to compass it.”",
        "“You’ve had a pretty narrow escape, young chap,” said one of the\nboatmen to Dick. “It was a pretty tough job you undertook.”",
        "“Yes,” said Dick. “That’s what I thought when I was in the water. If\nit hadn’t been for you, I don’t know what would have ’come of us.”",
        "“Anyhow you’re a plucky boy, or you wouldn’t have dared to jump into\nthe water after this little chap. It was a risky thing to do.”",
        "“I’m used to the water,” said Dick, modestly. “I didn’t stop to\nthink of the danger, but I wasn’t going to see that little fellow\ndrown without tryin’ to save him.”",
        "The boat at once headed for the ferry wharf on the Brooklyn side.\nThe captain of the ferry-boat, seeing the rescue, did not think\nit necessary to stop his boat, but kept on his way. The whole\noccurrence took place in less time than I have occupied in\ntelling it.",
        "The father was waiting on the wharf to receive his little boy, with\nwhat feelings of gratitude and joy can be easily understood. With a\nburst of happy tears he clasped him to his arms. Dick was about to\nwithdraw modestly, but the gentleman perceived the movement, and,\nputting down the child, came forward, and, clasping his hand, said\nwith emotion, “My brave boy, I owe you a debt I can never repay.\nBut for your timely service I should now be plunged into an anguish\nwhich I cannot think of without a shudder.”",
        "Our hero was ready enough to speak on most occasions, but always\nfelt awkward when he was praised.",
        "“It wasn’t any trouble,” he said, modestly. “I can swim like a top.”",
        "“But not many boys would have risked their lives for a stranger,\"\nsaid the gentleman. “But,” he added with a sudden thought, as his\nglance rested on Dick’s dripping garments, “both you and my little\nboy will take cold in wet clothes. Fortunately I have a friend\nliving close at hand, at whose house you will have an opportunity\nof taking off your clothes, and having them dried.”",
        "Dick protested that he never took cold; but Fosdick, who had now\njoined them, and who, it is needless to say, had been greatly\nalarmed at Dick’s danger, joined in urging compliance with the\ngentleman’s proposal, and in the end our hero had to yield. His\nnew friend secured a hack, the driver of which agreed for extra\nrecompense to receive the dripping boys into his carriage, and they\nwere whirled rapidly to a pleasant house in a side street, where\nmatters were quickly explained, and both boys were put to bed.",
        "“I aint used to goin’ to bed quite so early,” thought Dick. “This is\nthe queerest excursion I ever took.”",
        "Like most active boys Dick did not enjoy the prospect of spending\nhalf a day in bed; but his confinement did not last as long as he\nanticipated.",
        "In about an hour the door of his chamber was opened, and a servant\nappeared, bringing a new and handsome suit of clothes throughout.",
        "“You are to put on these,” said the servant to Dick; “but you\nneedn’t get up till you feel like it.”",
        "“Whose clothes are they?” asked Dick.",
        "“They are yours.”",
        "“Mine! Where did they come from?”",
        "“Mr. Rockwell sent out and bought them for you. They are the\nsame size as your wet ones.”",
        "“Is he here now?”",
        "“No. He bought another suit for the little boy, and has gone back to\nNew York. Here’s a note he asked me to give you.”",
        "Dick opened the paper, and read as follows,–",
        "“Please accept this outfit of clothes as the first instalment of\na debt which I can never repay. I have asked to have your wet suit\ndried, when you can reclaim it. Will you oblige me by calling\nto-morrow at my counting room, No. –, Pearl Street.",
        "  “Your friend,\n  “JAMES ROCKWELL.”",
        "When Dick was dressed in his new suit, he surveyed his figure with\npardonable complacency. It was the best he had ever worn, and fitted\nhim as well as if it had been made expressly for him.",
        "“He’s done the handsome thing,” said Dick to himself; “but there\nwasn’t no ’casion for his givin’ me these clothes. My lucky stars\nare shinin’ pretty bright now. Jumpin’ into the water pays better\nthan shinin’ boots; but I don’t think I’d like to try it more’n once\na week.”",
        "About eleven o’clock the next morning Dick repaired to Mr.\nRockwell’s counting-room on Pearl Street. He found himself in front\nof a large and handsome warehouse. The counting-room was on the\nlower floor. Our hero entered, and found Mr. Rockwell sitting at a\ndesk. No sooner did that gentleman see him than he arose, and,\nadvancing, shook Dick by the hand in the most friendly manner.",
        "“My young friend,” he said, “you have done me so great service that\nI wish to be of some service to you in return. Tell me about\nyourself, and what plans or wishes you have formed for the future.”",
        "Dick frankly related his past history, and told Mr. Rockwell of his\ndesire to get into a store or counting-room, and of the failure of\nall his applications thus far. The merchant listened attentively to\nDick’s statement, and, when he had finished, placed a sheet of paper\nbefore him, and, handing him a pen, said, “Will you write your name\non this piece of paper?”",
        "Dick wrote in a free, bold hand, the name Richard Hunter. He had\nvery much improved in his penmanship, as has already been mentioned,\nand now had no cause to be ashamed of it.",
        "Mr. Rockwell surveyed it approvingly.",
        "“How would you like to enter my counting-room as clerk, Richard?” he\nasked.",
        "Dick was about to say “Bully,” when he recollected himself, and\nanswered, “Very much.”",
        "“I suppose you know something of arithmetic, do you not?”",
        "“Yes, sir.”",
        "“Then you may consider yourself engaged at a salary of ten dollars a\nweek. You may come next Monday morning.”",
        "“Ten dollars!” repeated Dick, thinking he must have misunderstood.",
        "“Yes; will that be sufficient?”",
        "“It’s more than I can earn,” said Dick, honestly.",
        "“Perhaps it is at first,” said Mr. Rockwell, smiling; “but I am\nwilling to pay you that. I will besides advance you as fast as your\nprogress will justify it.”",
        "Dick was so elated that he hardly restrained himself from some\ndemonstration which would have astonished the merchant; but he\nexercised self-control, and only said, “I’ll try to serve you so\nfaithfully, sir, that you won’t repent having taken me into your\nservice.”",
        "“And I think you will succeed,” said Mr. Rockwell, encouragingly. “I\nwill not detain you any longer, for I have some important business\nto attend to. I shall expect to see you on Monday morning.”",
        "Dick left the counting-room, hardly knowing whether he stood on his\nhead or his heels, so overjoyed was he at the sudden change in his\nfortunes. Ten dollars a week was to him a fortune, and three times\nas much as he had expected to obtain at first. Indeed he would have\nbeen glad, only the day before, to get a place at three dollars a\nweek. He reflected that with the stock of clothes which he had now\non hand, he could save up at least half of it, and even then live\nbetter than he had been accustomed to do; so that his little fund in\nthe savings bank, instead of being diminished, would be steadily\nincreasing. Then he was to be advanced if he deserved it. It was\nindeed a bright prospect for a boy who, only a year before, could\nneither read nor write, and depended for a night’s lodging upon\nthe chance hospitality of an alley-way or old wagon. Dick’s great\nambition to “grow up ’spectable” seemed likely to be accomplished\nafter all.",
        "“I wish Fosdick was as well off as I am,” he thought generously. But\nhe determined to help his less fortunate friend, and assist him up\nthe ladder as he advanced himself.",
        "When Dick entered his room on Mott Street, he discovered that some\none else had been there before him, and two articles of wearing\napparel had disappeared.",
        "“By gracious!” he exclaimed; “somebody’s stole my Washington coat\nand Napoleon pants. Maybe it’s an agent of Barnum’s, who expects to\nmake a fortun’ by exhibitin’ the valooable wardrobe of a gentleman\nof fashion.”",
        "Dick did not shed many tears over his loss, as, in his present\ncircumstances, he never expected to have any further use for the\nwell-worn garments. It may be stated that he afterwards saw them\nadorning the figure of Micky Maguire; but whether that estimable\nyoung man stole them himself, he never ascertained. As to the loss,\nDick was rather pleased that it had occurred. It seemed to cut him\noff from the old vagabond life which he hoped never to resume.\nHenceforward he meant to press onward, and rise as high as possible.",
        "Although it was yet only noon, Dick did not go out again with his\nbrush. He felt that it was time to retire from business. He would\nleave his share of the public patronage to other boys less fortunate\nthan himself. That evening Dick and Fosdick had a long conversation.\nFosdick rejoiced heartily in his friend’s success, and on his side\nhad the pleasant news to communicate that his pay had been advanced\nto six dollars a week.",
        "“I think we can afford to leave Mott Street now,” he continued.\n\"This house isn’t as neat as it might be, and I shall like to live\nin a nicer quarter of the city.”",
        "“All right,” said Dick. “We’ll hunt up a new room to-morrow. I shall\nhave plenty of time, having retired from business. I’ll try to get\nmy reg’lar customers to take Johnny Nolan in my place. That boy\nhasn’t any enterprise. He needs some body to look out for him.”",
        "“You might give him your box and brush, too, Dick.”",
        "“No,” said Dick; “I’ll give him some new ones, but mine I want\nto keep, to remind me of the hard times I’ve had, when I was an\nignorant boot-black, and never expected to be anything better.”",
        "“When, in short, you were ’Ragged Dick.’ You must drop that name,\nand think of yourself now as\"–",
        "“Richard Hunter, Esq.,” said our hero, smiling.",
        "“A young gentleman on the way to fame and fortune,” added Fosdick.",
        "                              –––-",
        "Here ends the story of Ragged Dick. As Fosdick said, he is Ragged Dick\nno longer. He has taken a step upward, and is determined to mount still\nhigher. There are fresh adventures in store for him, and for others who\nhave been introduced in these pages. Those who have felt interested in\nhis early life will find his history continued in a new volume, forming\nthe second of the series, to be called,–",
