My heart ferments sufficiently of\nitself. I want strains to lull me, and I find them to perfection\nin my Homer. Often do I strive to allay the burning fever of my\nblood; and you have never witnessed anything so unsteady, so\nuncertain, as my heart. But need I confess this to you, my dear\nfriend, who have so often endured the anguish of witnessing my\nsudden transitions from sorrow to immoderate joy, and from sweet\nmelancholy to violent passions? I treat my poor heart like a sick\nchild, and gratify its every fancy. Do not mention this again:\nthere are people who would censure me for it.",
