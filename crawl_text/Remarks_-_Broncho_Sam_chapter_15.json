        "Speaking about cowboys, Sam Stewart, known from Montana to Old Mexico as\nBroncho Sam, was the chief. He was not a white man, an Indian, a greaser\nor a negro, but he had the nose of an Indian warrior, the curly hair of an\nAfrican, and the courtesy and equestrian grace of a Spaniard. A wide\nreputation as a “broncho breaker” gave him his name.",
        "To master an untamed broncho and teach him to lead, to drive and to be\nsafely-ridden was Sam’s mission during the warm weather when he was not\nriding the range. His special delight was to break the war-like heart of\nthe vicious wild pony of the plains and make him the servant of man.",
        "I’ve seen him mount a hostile “bucker,” and, clinching his italic legs\naround the body of his adversary, ride him till the blood would burst from\nSam’s nostrils and spatter horse and rider like rain. Most everyone knows\nwhat the bucking of the barbarous Western horse means. The wild horse\nprobably learned it from the antelope, for the latter does it the same\nway, i.e., he jumps straight up into the air, at the same instant\ncurving his back and coming down stiff-legged, with all four of his feet\nin a bunch. The concussion is considerable.",
        "I tried it once myself. I partially rode a roan broncho one spring day,\nwhich will always be green in my memory. The day, I mean, not the broncho.",
        "It occupied my entire attention to safely ride the cunning little beast,\nand when he began to ride me I put in a minority report against it.",
        "I have passed through an earthquake and an Indian outbreak, but I would\nrather ride an earthquake without saddle or bridle than to bestride a\nsuccessful broncho eruption. I remember that I wore a large pair of\nMexican spurs, but I forgot them until the saddle turned. Then I\nremembered them. Sitting down on them in an impulsive way brought them to\nmy mind. Then the broncho steed sat down on me, and that gave the spurs an\nopportunity to make a more lasting impression on my mind.",
        "To those who observed the charger with the double “cinch” across his back\nand the saddle in front of him like a big leather corset, sitting at the\nsame time on my person, there must have been a tinge of amusement; but to\nme it was not so frolicsome.",
        "There may be joy in a wild gallop across the boundless plains, in the\ncrisp morning, on the back of a fleet broncho; but when you return with\nyour ribs sticking through your vest, and find that your nimble steed has\nreturned to town two hours ahead of you, there is a tinge of sadness about\nit all.",
        "Broncho Sam, however, made a specialty of doing all the riding himself. He\nwouldn’t enter into any compromise and allow the horse to ride him.",
        "In a reckless moment he offered to bet ten dollars that he could mount and\nride a wild Texas steer. The money was put up. That settled it. Sam never\ntook water. This was true in a double sense. Well, he climbed the\ncross-bar of the corral-gate, and asked the other boys to turn out their\nbest steer, Marquis of Queensbury rules.",
        "As the steer passed out, Sam slid down and wrapped those parenthetical\nlegs of his around that high-headed, broad-horned brute, and he rode him\ntill the fleet-footed animal fell down on the buffalo grass, ran his hot\nred tongue out across the blue horizon, shook his tail convulsively,\nswelled up sadly and died.",
        "It took Sam four days to walk back.",
        "A ten-dollar bill looks as large to me as the star spangled banner, some\ntimes; but that is an avenue of wealth that had not occurred to me.",
        "I’d rather ride a buzz-saw at two dollars a day and found.",
