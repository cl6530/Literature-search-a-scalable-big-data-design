        "[62] ABOUT the middle of the seventeenth century, two opposite views\nof a question, upon which neither Scripture, nor Council, nor Pope,\nhad spoken with authority–the question as to the amount of freedom\nleft to man by the overpowering work of divine grace upon him–had\nseemed likely for a moment to divide the Roman Church into two rival\nsects.  In the diocese of Paris, however, the controversy narrowed\nitself into a mere personal quarrel between the Jesuit Fathers and\nthe religious community of Port-Royal, and might have been forgotten\nbut for the intervention of a new writer in whom French literature\nmade more than a new step.  It became at once, as if by a new\ncreation, what it has remained–a pattern of absolutely unencumbered\nexpressiveness.",
        "In 1656 Pascal, then thirty-three years old, under the form of\n“Letters to a Provincial by one of his Friends,” put forth a series\nof [63] pamphlets in which all that was vulnerable in the Jesuit\nFathers was laid bare to the profit of their opponents.  At the\nmoment the quarrel turned on the proposed censure of Antoine Arnauld\nby the Sorbonne, by the University of Paris as a religious body.\nPascal, intimate, like many another fine intellect of the day, with\nthe Port-Royalists, was Arnauld’s friend, and it belonged to the\nardour of his genius, at least as he was then, to be a very active\nfriend.  He took up the pen as other chivalrous gentlemen of the day\ntook up the sword, and showed himself a master of the art of fence\ntherewith.  His delicate exercise of himself with that weapon was\nnothing less than a revelation to all the world of the capabilities,\nthe true genius of the French language in prose.",
        "Those who think of Pascal in his final sanctity, his detachment of\nsoul from all but the greatest matters, may be surprised, when they\nturn to the “Letters,” to find him treating questions, as serious for\nthe friends he was defending as for their adversaries, ironically,\nwith a but half-veiled disdain for them, or an affected humility at\nbeing unskilled in them and no theologian.  He does not allow us to\nforget that he is, after all, a layman; while he introduces us,\nalmost avowedly, into a world of unmeaning terms, and unreal\ndistinctions and suppositions that can never be verified.  The world\nin general, indeed, se paye des paroles.  That saying belongs to\nPascal, and [64] he uses it with reference to the Jesuits and their\nfavourite expression of “sufficient grace.”  In the earliest\n“Letters” he creates in us a feeling that, however orthodox one’s\nintention, it is scarcely possible to speak of the matters then so\nabundantly discussed by religious people without heresy at some\nunguarded point.  The suspected proposition of Arnauld, it is\nadmitted by one of his foes, “would be Catholic in the mouth of any\none but M. Arnauld.”  “The truth,” as it lay between Arnauld and his\nopponents, is a thing so delicate that “pour peu qu’on s’en retire,\non tombe dans l’erreur; mais cette erreur est si deliee, que, pour\npeu qu’on s’en eloigne, on se trouve dans la verite.”",
        "Some, indeed, may find in the very delicacy, the curiosity, with\nwhich such distinctions are drawn, by Pascal’s friends as well as by\ntheir foes, only the impertinence, the profanities, of the theologian\nby profession, all too intimate in laying down the law of the things\nhe deals with–the things “which eye hath not seen” pressing into the\nsecrets of God’s sublime commerce with men, in which, it may be, He\ndiffers with every single human soul, by forms of thought adapted\nfrom the poorest sort of men’s dealings with each other, from the\ntrader, or the attorney.  Pascal notes too the “impious buffooneries\"\nof his opponents.  The good Fathers, perhaps, only meant them to\npromote geniality of temper in the debate.  But of such failures–\nfailures of taste, of respect towards one’s [65] own point of view–\nthe world is ever unamiably aware; and in the “Letters” there is much\nto move the self-complacent smile of the worldling, as Pascal\ndescribes his experiences, while he went from one authority to\nanother to find out what was really meant by the distinction between\ngrace “sufficient,” grace “efficacious,” grace “active,” grace\n“victorious.”  He heard, for instance, that all men have sufficient\ngrace to do God’s will; but it is not always prochain, not always at\nhand, at the moment of temptation to do otherwise.  So far, then,\nPascal’s charges are those which may seem to lie ready to hand\nagainst all who study theology, a looseness of thought and language,\nthat would pass nowhere else, in making what are professedly very\nfine distinctions; the insincerity with which terms are carefully\nchosen to cover opposite meanings; the fatuity with which opposite\nmeanings revolve into one another, in the strange vacuous atmosphere\ngenerated by professional divines.",
        "Up to this point, you see, Pascal is the countryman of Rabelais and\nMontaigne, smiling with the fine malice of the one, laughing outright\nwith the gaiety of the other, all the world joining in the laugh–\nwell, at the silliness of the clergy, who seem indeed not to know\ntheir own business.  It is we, the laity, he would urge, who are\nserious, and disinterested, because sincerely interested, in these\ngreat questionings.  Jalousie de metier, the reader may suspect, has\nsomething to do with [66] the Professional leaders on both sides of\nthe controversy; but at the actual turn controversy took just then,\nit was against the Jesuit Fathers that Pascal’s charges came home in\nfull force.  And their sin is above all that sin, unpardonable with\nmen of the world sans peur et sans reproche, of a lack of self-\nrespect, sins against pride, if the paradox may be allowed, all the\nundignified faults, in a word, of essentially little people when they\ninterfere in great matters–faults promoted in the direction of the\nconsciences of women and children, weak concessions to weak people\nwho want to be saved in some easy way quite other than Pascal’s high,\nfine, chivalrous way of gaining salvation, an incapacity to say what\none thinks with the glove thrown down.  He supposes a Jansenist to\nturn upon his opponent who uses the term “sufficient” grace, while\nreally meaning, as he alleges, insufficient, with the words:–\"Your\nexplanation would be odious to men of the world.  They speak more\nsincerely than you on matters of far less importance than this.\"\nWith the world, Pascal, in the “Provincial Letters,” had immediate\nsuccess.  “All the world,” we read in his friend’s supposed reply to\nthe second “Letter,” “sees them; all the world understands them.  Men\nof the world find them agreeable, and even women intelligible.”  A\ncentury later Voltaire found them very agreeable.  The spirit in\nwhich Pascal deals with his opponents, his irony, may remind us of\nthe “Apology” of [67] Socrates; the style which secured them\nimmediate access to people who, as a rule, find the subjects there\ntreated hopelessly dry, reminds us of the “Apologia” of Newman.",
        "The essence of all good style, whatever its accidents may be, is\nexpressiveness.  It is mastered in proportion to the justice, the\nnicety with which words balance or match their meaning, and their\nwriter succeeds in saying what he wills, grave or gay, severe or\nflorid, simple or complex.  Pascal was a master of style because, as\nhis sister tells us, recording his earliest years, he had a wonderful\nnatural facility a dire ce qu’il voulait en la maniere qu’il voulait.",
        "Facit indignatio versus.  The indignation which caused Pascal to\nwrite the “Letters” was of a supercilious kind, and what he willed to\nsay in them led to the development of all those qualities that are\nsummed up in the French term l’esprit.  Voltaire declared that the\nbest comedies of Moliere n’ont pas plus de sel que les premieres\nlettres.  “Vos maximes,” Pascal assures the Jesuit Fathers, “ont je\nne sais quoi de divertissant, qui rejouit toujours le monde,” and\nthey lose nothing of that character in his handling of them, so much\nso that it was clear from the first that the world in general would\nnever ask whether Pascal had been quite fair to his opponents:\n“N’etes-vous donc pas ridicules, mes Peres?  Qu’on satisfait au\nprecepte d’ouir la messe en entendant quatre quarts de messe a la\nfois de differents pretres!”  When [68] you have the like of that it\nis impossible not to laugh, parce que rien n’y porte davantage qu’une\ndisproportion surprenante entre ce qu’on attend et ce qu’on voit.",
        "He has “salt” also, of another kind.  He drives straight at the\nJesuits, for instance, rather than at those who do but copy them,\nbecause, as he tells us: Les choses valent toujours mieux dans leur\nsource.  What equity of expression, how brief, how untranslateable!\nAnd the “Letters” abound in such things.",
        "But to his comparison of Pascal with Moliere, Voltaire added that\nBossuet n’a rien de plus sublime que les dernieres.  And in truth the\nmore serious note of the impassioned servant of religion whose lips\nhave been touched with altar-fire, whose seriousness came to be like\nsome incurable malady, a visitation of God, as people used to say, is\npresently struck when, in the natural course of his argument, his\nthoughts are carried, from a mere passage of arms between one man or\none class of men and another, deep down to those awful encounters of\nthe individual soul with itself which are formulated in the eternal\nproblem of predestination.",
        "In their doctrine of “sufficient grace” the Jesuits had presented a\nview of the conflict of good and evil in the soul, which is\nhonourable to God and encouraging to man, and which has catholicity\non its face.  All to whom entrance into the Church, through its\nformal ministries, [69] lies open are truly called of God, while\nbeyond it stretches the ocean of “His uncovenanted mercies.”  That is\na doctrine for the many, for those whose position in the religious\nlife is mediocrity, who so far as themselves or others can discern\nhave nothing about them of eternal or necessary or irresistible\nreprobation, or of the eternal condition opposite to that.",
        "The so-called Jansenist doctrine, on the other hand, of [   ]+ but\nirresistible grace was the appropriate view of the Port-Royalists,\nhigh-pitched, eager souls as they were, and of their friend Pascal\nhimself, however much in his turn he might refine upon it.  Whether\nor not, as a matter of fact, upon which, as distinct from matters of\nfaith, an infallible pope can be mistaken, the dreary old Dutch\nbishop Jansenius had really taught Jansenism, the Port-Royalists had\nfound in his “Augustinus” an incentive to devotion, and were avowedly\nhis adherents.  In that somewhat gloomy, that too deeply impressed,\nthat fanatical age, they were the Calvinists of the Roman Catholic\nChurch, maintaining, emphasising in it a view, a tradition, really\nconstant in it from St. Augustin, from St. Paul himself.  It is a\nmerit of Pascal, his literary merit, to have given a very fine-toned\nexpression to that doctrine, though mainly in the way of a criticism\nof its opponents, to one side or aspect of an eternal controversy,\neternally suspended, as representing two opposite aspects of\nexperience [70] itself.  Calvin and Arminius, Jansen and Molina sum\nup, in fact, respectively, like the respective adherents of the\nfreedom or of the necessity of the human will, in the more general\nquestion of moral philosophy, two opposed, two counter trains of\nphenomena actually observable by us in human action, too large and\ncomplex a matter, as it is, to be embodied or summed up in any one\nsingle proposition or idea.",
        "There are moments of one’s own life, aspects of the life of others,\nof which the conclusion that the will is free seems to be the only–\nis the natural or reasonable–account.  Yet those very moments on\nreflexion, on second thoughts, present themselves again, as but links\nin a chain, in an all-embracing network of chains.  In all education\nwe assume, in some inexplicable combination, at once the freedom and\nthe necessity of the subject of it.  And who on a survey of life from\noutside would willingly lose the dramatic contrasts, the alternating\ninterests, for which the opposed ideas of freedom and necessity are\nour respective points of view?  How significant become the details we\nmight otherwise pass by almost unobserved, but to which we are put on\nthe alert by the abstract query whether a man be indeed a freeman or\na slave, as we watch from aside his devious course, his struggles,\nhis final tragedy or triumph.  So much value at least there may be in\nproblems insoluble in themselves, such as that great controversy of\nPascal’s day [71] between Jesuit and Jansenist.  And here again who\nwould forego, in the spectacle of the religious history of the human\nsoul, the aspects, the details which the doctrines of universal and\nparticular grace respectively embody?  The Jesuit doctrine of\nsufficient grace is certainly, to use the familiar expression, a very\npleasant doctrine conducive to the due feeding of the whole flock of\nChrist, as being, as assuming them to be, what they really are, at\nthe worst, God’s silly sheep.  It has something in it congruous with\nthe rising of the physical sun on the evil and on the good, while the\nwheat and the tares grow naturally, peacefully together.  But how\npleasant also the opposite doctrine, how true, how truly descriptive\nof certain distinguished, magnifical, or elect souls, vessels of\nelection, epris des hauteurs, as we see them pass across the world’s\nstage, as if led on by a kind of thirst for God!  Its necessary\ncounterpart, of course, we may find, at least dramatically true of\nsome; we can name them in history, perhaps from our own experience;\nsouls of whom it seems but an obvious story to tell that they seemed\nto be in love with eternal death, to have borne on them from the\nfirst signs of reprobation.  Of certain quite visibly elect souls, at\nall events, the theory of irresistible grace might seem the almost\nnecessary explanation.  Most reasonable, most natural, most truly is\nit descriptive of Pascal himself.",
        "[72] So far, indeed, up to the year 1656, Pascal’s annus mirabilis,\nthe year of the “Letters,” the world had been allowed to see only one\nside of him.  Early in life he had achieved brilliant overtures in\nthe abstract sciences, and, inheriting much of the quality of a fine\ngentleman, he figures, with his trenchant manner, never at a loss, as\na quite secular person, stirred on occasion to take part in a\nreligious debate.  But it is after the grand fashion of the mundane\nquarrels of that day, the age of the sentiment of personal honour, in\nwhich it was so natural for the good-natured Jesuits, stirring all\nPascal’s satiric power, to excuse as well as they could the act de\ntuer pour un simple medisance.  The Church was still an estate of the\nrealm with all the obligations of the noblesse, and it was still\nsomething worse than bad taste, it was dangerous to express religious\ndoubts.  About the Catholic religion, as he conceived it, Pascal\ndisplays the assured attitude of an ancient Crusader.  He has the\nfull courage of his opinions, and by his elegant easy gallantry in\nspeaking for it he gives to religion then and now a kind of dignity\nit had lost with other controversialists in the eyes of the world.\nThere is abundant gaiety also in the “Letters.”  He quotes from\nTertullian to the effect that c’est proprement a la verite qu’il\nappartient de rire parce qu’elle est gaie, et de se jouer de ses\nennemis parce qu’elle est assuree de sa victoire.  For he could find\nquotations to his purpose from recondite writers, [73] though he was\nnot a man of erudition; like a man of the world again, he read\nlittle, but that absorbingly, was the master of two authors,\nEpictetus and Montaigne, and, as appeared afterwards, of the\nScriptures in the Vulgate.",
        "So far, his imposing carriage of himself intellectually might lead us\nto suspect that the forced humilities of his later years are\nindirectly a discovery of what seems one leading quality of the\nnatural man in him, a pride that could be quite fierce on occasion.\nAnd, like another rich young man whom Jesus loved, he lacked nothing\nto make the world also love and confide in, as it already flattered,\nhim.  He turned from it, decided to live a single life.  Was it the\nmere oddity of genius?  Or its last fine dainty touch of difference\nfrom ordinary people and their motives?  Or that sanctity of which,\nin some cases, the world itself instinctively feels the distinction,\nthough it shrinks from the true explanation of it?  Certainly, all\nthings considered, on the morrow of the “Letters,” Blaise Pascal, at\nthe age of thirty-three, had a brilliant worldly future before him,\nhad he cared duly to wait upon, to serve it.  To develop the already\nconsiderable position of his family among the gentry of Auvergne\nwould have been to follow the way of his time, in which so many noble\nnames had been founded on professional talents.  Increasingly,\nhowever, from early youth, he had been the subject of a malady so\nhopeless [74] and inexplicable that in that superstitious age some\nfancied it the result of a malign spell in infancy.  Gradually, the\nworld almost loses sight of him, hears at last, some time after it\nhad looked for that event, that he had died, of course very piously,\namong those sombre people, his friends and relations of Port-Royal,\nwith whom he had taken refuge, and seemed already to have been buried\nalive.  And in the year 1670, not till eight years after his death,\nthe “Pensees” appeared–\"Pensees de M. Pascal sur la Religion et sur\nquelques autres sujets\"–or rather a selection from those “Thoughts\"\nby the Port-Royalists, still in fear of consequences to the\nstruggling Jansenist party, anxious to present Pascal’s doctrine as\nfar as possible in conformity with the Jesuit sense, as also to\ndivert the vaguer parts of it more entirely into their own.  The\nincomparable words were altered, the order changed or lost, the\nthoughts themselves omitted or retrenched.  Written in short\nintervals of relief from suffering, they were contributions to a\nlarge and methodical work–\"Pensees de M. Pascal sur la Religion et\nsur quelques autres sujets\"–on a good many things besides, as the\nreader finds, on many of the great things of this world which seemed\nto him to come in contact or competition with religion.  In the true\nversion of the “Thoughts,” edited at last by Faugere, in 1844, from\nPascal’s own MSS., in the National Library, they group themselves\ninto certain definite trains [75] of speculation and study.  But it\nis still, nevertheless, as isolated thoughts, as inspirations, so to\ncall them, penetrating what seemed hopelessly dark, summarising what\nseemed hopelessly confused, sticking fast in men’s memories, floating\nlightly, or going far, that they have left so deep a mark in\nliterature.  For again the manner, also, their style precisely\nbecomes them.  The merits of Pascal’s style, indeed, as of the French\nlanguage itself, still is to say beaucoup de choses en peu de mots;\nand the brevity, the discerning edge, the impassioned concentration\nof the language are here one with the ardent immediate apprehensions\nof his spirit.",
        "One of the literary merits of the “Provincial Letters” is that they\nare really like letters; they are essentially a conversation by\nwriting with other persons.  What we have in the “Thoughts” is the\nconversation of the writer with himself, with himself and with God,\nor rather concerning Him, for He is, in Pascal’s favourite phrase\nfrom the Vulgate, Deus absconditus, He who never directly shows\nHimself.  Choses de coeur the “Thoughts” are, indeed those of an\nindividual, though they seem to have determined the very outlines of\na great subject for all other persons.  In Pascal, at the summit of\nthe Puy de Dome in his native Auvergne, experimenting on the weight\nof the invisible air, proving it to be ever all around by its\neffects, we are presented with one of the more pleasing [76] aspects\nof his earlier, more wholesome, open-air life.  In the great work of\nwhich the “Thoughts” are the first head, Pascal conceived himself to\nbe doing something of the same kind in the spiritual order by a\ndemonstration of this other invisible world all around us, with its\nreally ponderable forces, its movement, its attractions and\nrepulsions, the world of grace, unseen, but, as he thinks, the one\nonly hypothesis that can explain the experienced, admitted facts.\nWhether or not he was fixing permanently in the “Pensees” the\noutlines, the principles, of a great system of assent, of conviction,\nfor acceptance by the intellect, he was certainly fixing these with\nall the imaginative depth and sufficiency of Shakespeare himself, the\nfancied opposites, the attitudes, the necessary forms of pathos,+ of a\ngreat tragedy in the heart, the soul, the essential human tragedy, as\ntypical and central in its expression here, as Hamlet–what the  soul\npasses, and must pass, through, aux abois with nothingness, or with\nthose offended mysterious powers that may really occupy it–or when\nconfronted with the thought of what are called the “four last things\"\nit yields this way or that.  What might have passed with all its\nfiery ways for an esprit de secte et de cabale is now revealed amid\nthe disputes not of a single generation but of eternal ones, by the\nlight of a phenomenal storm of blinding and blasting inspirations.",
        "[77] Observe, he is not a sceptic converted, a returned infidel, but\nis seen there as if at the very centre of a perpetually maintained\ntragic crisis holding the faith steadfastly, but amid the well-poised\npoints of essential doubt all around him and it.  It is no mere calm\nsupersession of a state of doubt by a state of faith; the doubts\nnever die, they are only just kept down in a perpetual agonia.\nEverywhere in the “Letters” he had seemed so great a master–a master\nof himself–never at a loss, taking the conflict so lightly, with so\nlight a heart: in the great Atlantean travail of the “Thoughts” his\nfeet sometimes “are almost gone.”  In his soul’s agony, theological\nabstractions seem to become personal powers.  It was as if just below\nthe surface of the green undulations, the stately woods, of his own\nstrange country of Auvergne, the volcanic fires had suddenly\ndiscovered themselves anew.  In truth into his typical diagnosis, as\nit may seem, of the tragedy of the human soul, there have passed not\nmerely the personal feelings, the temperament of an individual, but\nhis malady also, a physical malady.  Great genius, we know, has the\npower of elevating, transmuting, serving itself by the accidental\nconditions about it, however unpromising–poverty, and the like.  It\nwas certainly so with Pascal’s long-continued physical sufferings.\nThat aigreur, which is part of the native colour of Pascal’s genius,\nis reinforced in the [78] “Pensees” by insupportable languor,\nalternating with supportable pain, as he died little by little\nthrough the eight years of their composition.  They are essentially\nthe utterance of a soul malade–a soul of great genius, whose malady\nbecame a new quality of that genius, perfecting it thus, by its very\ndefect, as a type on the intellectual stage, and thereby guiding,\nreassuring sympathetically, manning by a sense of good company that\nlarge class of persons who are malade in the same way.  “La maladie\nest l’etat naturel des Chretiens,” says Pascal himself.  And we\nconcede that every one of us more or less is ailing thus, as another\nhas told us that life itself is a disease of the spirit.",
        "From Port-Royal also came, about the year 1670, a painful book, the\n“Life of Pascal,” a portrait painted slowly from the life or living\ndeath, but with an almost exclusive preference for traits expressive\nof disease.  The post-mortem examination of Pascal’s brain revealed,\nwe are now told, the secret, not merely of that long prostration,\nthose sudden passing torments, but of something analogous to them in\nPascal’s genius and work.  Well! the light cast indirectly on the\nliterary work of Pascal by Mme. Perier’s “Life” is of a similar kind.\nIt is a veritable chapter in morbid pathology, though it may have\ntruly a beauty for experts, the beauty which belongs to all refined\ncases even of cerebral disturbance.  That he should [79] have sought\nrelief from his singular wretchedness, in that sombre company, is\nlike the second stroke of tragedy upon him.  At moments Pascal\nbecomes almost a sectarian, and seems to pass out of the genial broad\nheaven of the Catholic Church.  He had lent himself in those last\nyears to a kind of pieties which do not make a winning picture, which\nalways have about them, even when they show themselves in men\nphysically strong, something of the small compass of the sick-\nchamber.  His medieval or oriental self-tortures, all the painful\nefforts at absolute detachment, a perverse asceticism taking all\nthere still was to spare from the denuded and suffering body, might\nwell, you may think, have died with him, but are here recorded,\nchiefly by way of showing the world, the Jesuits, that the\nJansenists, too, had a saint quite after their mind.",
        "But though, at first sight, you may find a pettiness in those minute\npieties, they have their signification as a testimony to the\nwholeness of Pascal’s assent, the entirety of his submission, his\nimmense sincerity, the heroic grandeur of his achieved faith.  The\nseventeenth century presents survivals of the gloomy mental habits of\nthe Middle Age, but for the most part of a somewhat theatrical kind,\nimitations of Francis and Dominic or of their earlier imitators.  In\nPascal they are original, and have all their seriousness.  Que je\nn’en sois [80] jamais separe–pas separe eternellement, he repeats,\nor makes that strange sort of MS. amulet, of which his sister tells\nus, repeat for him.  Cast me not away from Thy presence; and take not\nThy Holy Spirit from me.  It is table rase he is trying to make of\nhimself, that He might reign there absolutely alone, who, however, as\nhe was bound to think, had made and blest all those things he\ndeclined to accept.  Deeper and deeper, then, he retreated into the\nrenuncient life.  He could not, had he wished, deprive himself of\nthat his greatest gift–literally a gift he might have thought it not\nto be buried but accounted for–the gift of le beau dire, of writing\nbeautifully.  “Il avoit renonce depuis longtemps aux sciences\npurement humains.”  To him who had known them so well, and as if by\nintuition, those abstract and perdurable forms of service might well\nhave seemed a part of “the Lord’s doing, marvellous in our eyes,” as\nhis favourite Psalm cxix., the psalm des petites heures, the cxviii.\nof the Vulgate, says.*  These, too, he counts now as but a variety of\nle neant and vanity of things.  He no longer records, therefore, the\nmathematical apercus that may visit him; and in his scruples, his\nsuspicions of’ visible beauty, he interests us as precisely an\ninversion of what is called the aesthetic life.",
        "[81] Yet his faith, as in the days of the Middle Age, had been\nsupported, rewarded, by what he believed to be visible miracle among\nthe strange lights and shades of that retired place.  Pascal’s niece,\nthe daughter of Madame Perier, a girl ten years of age, suffered from\na disease of the eyes pronounced to be incurable.  The disease was a\npeculiarly distressing one, the sort of affliction which, falling on\na young child, may lead one to question the presence of divine\njustice in the world, makes one long that miracles were possible.\nWell!  Pascal, for one, believed that on occasion that profound\naspiration had been followed up by the power desired.  A thorn from\nthe crown of Jesus, as was believed, had been lately brought to the\nPort-Royal du Faubourg S. Jacques in Paris, and was one day applied\ndevoutly to the eye of the suffering child.  What followed was an\nimmediate and complete cure, fully attested by experts.  Ah!  Thou\nhast given him his heart’s desire: and hast not denied him the\nrequest of his lips.  Pascal, and the young girl herself, faithfully\nto the end of a long life, believed the circumstances to have been\nmiraculous.  Otherwise, we do not see that Pascal was ever permitted\nto enjoy (so to speak) the religion for which he had exchanged so\nmuch; that the sense of acceptance, of assurance, had come to him;\nthat for him the Spouse had ever penetrated the veil of the ordinary\nroutine of the means of grace; [82] nothing that corresponded as a\nmatter of clear personal intercourse of the very senses to the\ngreatness of his surrender–who had emptied himself of all other\nthings.  Besides, there was some not wholly-explained delay in his\nreception, in those his last days, of the Sacrament.  It was brought\nto him just in time–\"Voici celui que vous avez tant desire!\"–the\nministrant says to the dying man.  Pascal was then aged thirty-nine–\nan age you may remember fancifully noted as fatal to genius.",
        "Pascal’s “Thoughts,” then, we shall not rightly measure but as the\noutcome, the utterance, of a soul diseased, a soul permanently ill at\nease.  We find in their constant tension something of insomnia, of\nthat sleeplessness which can never be a quite healthful condition of\nmind in a human body.  Sometimes they are cries, cries of obscure\npain rather than thoughts–those great fine sayings which seem to\nbetray by their depth of sound the vast unseen hollow places of\nnature, of humanity, just beneath one’s feet or at one’s side.\nReading them, so modern still are those thoughts, so rich and various\nin suggestion, that one seems to witness the mental seed-sowing of\nthe next two centuries, and perhaps more, as to those matters with\nwhich he concerns himself.  Intuitions of a religious genius, they\nmay well be taken also as the final considerations of the natural\nman, as a religious inquirer on doubt and faith, and their place in\n[83] things.  Listen now to some of these “Thoughts” taken at random:\ntaken at first for their brevity.  Peu de chose nous console, parce\nque peu de chose nous afflige.  Par l’espace l’univers me comprend et\nm’engloutit comme un point: par la pensee je le comprends.  Things\nlike these put us en route with Pascal.  Toutes les bonnes maximes\nsont dans le monde: on ne manque que de les appliquer.  The great\nascetic was always hard on amusements, on mere pastimes: Le\ndivertissement nous amuse, one and all of us, et nous fait arriver\ninsensiblement a la mort.  Nous perdons encore la vie avec joie,\npourvu qu’on en parle.  On ne peut faire une bonne physionomie (in a\nportrait) qu’en accordant toutes nos contrarietes.  L’homme n’est\nqu’un roseau, le plus foible de la nature, mais c’est un roseau\npensant.  Il ne faut pas que l’univers entier s’arme pour l’ecraser.\nUne vapeur, une goutte d’eau, suffit pour le tuer.  Mais quand\nl’univers l’ecraseroit, l’homme seroit encore plus noble que se qui\nle tue, parce qu’il sait qu’il meurt, et l’avantage que l’univers a\nsur lui, l’univers n’en sait rien.  It is not thought by which that\nexcels, but the convincing force of imagination which sublimates its\nvery triteness.  Toute notre dignite consiste donc en la pensee.",
        "There, then, you have at random the sort of stuff of which the\n“Pensees” are made.  Let me now briefly indicate, also by quotation\nagain, some of the main leading tendencies in them.  La chose la plus\nimportante a toute la vie c’est la [84] choix du metier: le hasard en\ndispose.  There we recognise the manner of thought of Montaigne.  Now\none of the leading interests in the study of Pascal is to trace the\ninfluence upon him of the typical sceptic of the preceding century.\nPascal’s “Thoughts” we shall never understand unless we realise the\nunder-texture in them of Montaigne’s very phrases, the fascination\nthe “Essays” had for Pascal in his capacity of one of the children of\nlight, as giving a veritable compte rendu of the Satanic course of\nthis world since the Fall, set forth with all the persuasiveness, the\npower and charm, all the gifts of Satan, the veritable light on\nthings he has at his disposal.",
        "Pascal re-echoes Montaigne then in asserting the paradoxical\ncharacter of man and his experience.  The old headings under which\nthe Port-Royalist editors grouped the “Thoughts” recall the titles of\nMontaigne’s “Essays\"–\"Of the Disproportion of Man,” and the like. As\nstrongly as Montaigne he delights in asserting the relative, local,\nephemeral and merely provisional character of our ideas of law, vice,\nvirtue, happiness, and so forth.  Comme la mode fait l’agrement aussi\nfait-elle la justice.  La justice et la verite sont deux pointes si\nsubtiles, que nos instruments sont trop mousses pour y toucher\nexactement.  Bien suivant la seule raison n’est juste de soi: tout\nbranle avec le temps.  Sometimes he strikes the express accent of\nMontaigne: Ceux qui sont dans un vaisseau croient que ceux qui sont\n[85] au bord fuient.  Le langage est pareil de tous cotes.  Il faut\navoir un point fixe pour en juger.  Le port juge ceux qui sont dans\nun vaisseau, mais ou prendrons-nous un port dans la morale?  At times\nhe seems to forget that he himself and Montaigne are after all not of\nthe same flock, as his mind grazes in those pleasant places.  Qu’il\n(man) se regarde comme egare dans ce canton detourne de la nature, et\nde ce petit cachot ou il se trouve loge, qu’il apprenne the earth, et\nsoi-meme a son juste prix.  Il ffre, mais elle est ployable a tous\nsens; et ainsi il n’y en a point.  Un meme sens change selon les\nparoles qui l’expriment.  He has touches even of what he calls the\nmalignity, the malign irony of Montaigne.  Rien que la mediocrite\nn’est bon, he says,–epris des hauteurs, as he so conspicuously was–\nC’est sortir de l’humanite que de sortir du milieu; la grandeur de\nl’ame humaine consiste a savoir s’y tenir.  Rien ne fortifie plus le\npyrrhonisme–that is ever his word for scepticism–que ce qu’il y en\na qui ne sont pas pyrrhoniens: si tous etaient ils auraient tort.\nYou may even credit him, like Montaigne, with a somewhat Satanic\nintimacy with the ways, the cruel ways, the weakness, lachete, of the\nhuman heart, so that, as he says of Montaigne, himself too might be a\npernicious study for those who have a native tendency to corruption.",
        "The paradoxical condition of the world, the natural inconsistency of\nman, his strange [86] blending of meanness with ancient greatness,\nthe caprices of his status here, of his power and attainments, in the\nissue of his existence–that is what the study of Montaigne had\nenforced on Pascal as the sincere compte rendu of experience.  But\nthen he passes at a tangent from the circle of the great sceptic’s\napprehension.  That prospect of man and the world, undulant,\ncapricious, inconsistent, contemptible, lache, full of contradiction,\nwith a soul of evil in things good, irreducible to law, upon which,\nafter all, Montaigne looks out with a complacency so entire, fills\nPascal with terror.  It is the world on the morrow of a great\ncatastrophe, the casual forces of which have by no means spent\nthemselves.  Yes! this world we see, of which we are a part, with its\nthousand dislocations, is precisely what we might expect as resultant\nfrom the Fall of Man, with consequences in full working still.  It\npresents the appropriate aspect of a lost world, though with beams of\nredeeming grace about it, those, too, distributed somewhat\ncapriciously to chosen people and elect souls, who, after all, can\nhave but an ill time of it here.  Under the tragic eclairs of divine\nwrath essentially implacable, the gentle, pleasantly undulating,\nsunny, earthly prospect of poor loveable humanity which opens out for\none in Montaigne’s “Essays,” becomes for Pascal a scene of harsh\nprecipices, of threatening heights and depths–the depths of his own\nnothingness.  Vanity: nothingness: these [87] are his catchwords:\nNous sommes incapables et du vrai et du bien; nous sommes tous\ncondamnes.  Ce qui y parait (i.e., what we see in the world) ne\nmarque ni une exclusion totale ni une presence manifeste de divinite,\nmais la presence d’un Dieu qui se cache: (Deus absconditus, that is a\nrecurrent favourite thought of his) tout porte ce caractere.  In this\nworld of abysmal dilemmas, he is ready to push all things to their\nextremes.  All or nothing; for him real morality will be nothing\nshort of sanctity.  En Jesus Christ toutes les contradictions sont\naccordees.  Yet what difficulties again in the religion of Christ!\nNulle autre religion n’a propose de se hair.  La seule religion\ncontraire a la nature, contraire au sens commun, est la seule qui ait\ntoujours ete.",
        "Multitudes in every generation have felt at least the aesthetic charm\nof the rites of the Catholic Church.  For Pascal, on the other hand,\na certain weariness, a certain puerility, a certain unprofitableness\nin them is but an extra trial of faith.  He seems to have little\nsense of the beauty of holiness.  And for his sombre, trenchant,\nprecipitous philosophy there could be no middle terms; irresistible\nelection, irresistible reprobation; only sometimes extremes meet, and\nagain it may be the trial of faith that the justified seem as\nloveless and unlovely as the reprobate.  Abetissez-vous!  A nature,\nyou may think, that would magnify things to the utmost, nurse, expand\nthem beyond their natural bounds by his [88] reflex action upon them.\nThus revelation is to be received on evidence, indeed, but an\nevidence conclusive only on a presupposition or series of\npresuppositions, evidence that is supplemented by an act of\nimagination, or by the grace of faith, shall we say?  At any rate,\nthe fact is, that the genius of the great reasoner, of this great\nmaster of the abstract and deductive sciences, turned theologian,\ncarrying the methods of thought there formed into the things of\nfaith, was after all of the imaginative order.  Now hear what he says\nof imagination: Cette faculte trompeuse, qui semble nous etre donnee\nexpres pour nous induire a une erreur necessaire.  That has a sort of\nnecessity in it.  What he says has again the air of Montaigne, and he\nsays much of the same kind: Cette superbe puissance ennemie de la\nraison, combien toutes les richesses de la terre sont insuffisantes\nsans son consentement.  The imagination has the disposition of all\nthings: Elle fait la beaute, la justice, et le bonheur, qui est le\ntout du monde.  L’imagination dispose de tout.  And what we have here\nto note is its extraordinary power in himself.  Strong in him as the\nreasoning faculty, so to speak, it administered the reasoning faculty\nin him a son grbut he was unaware of it, that power d’autant plus\nfourbe qu’elle ne l’est pas toujours.  Hidden under the apparent\nrigidity of his favourite studies, imagination, even in them, played\na large part.  Physics, mathematics were with him largely matters of\nintuition, anticipation, [89] precocious discovery, short cuts,\nsuperb guessing.  It was the inventive element in his work and his\nway of putting things that surprised those best able to judge.  He\nmight have discovered the mathematical sciences for himself, it is\nalleged, had his father, as he once had a mind to do, withheld him\nfrom instruction in them.",
        "About the time when he was bidding adieu to the world, Pascal had an\naccident.  As he drove round a corner on the Seine side to cross the\nbridge at Neuilly, the horses were precipitated down the bank into\nthe water.  Pascal escaped, but with a nervous shock, a certain\nhallucination, from which he never recovered.  As he walked or sat he\nwas apt to perceive a yawning depth beside him; would set stick or\nchair there to reassure himself.  We are now told, indeed, that that\ncircumstance has been greatly exaggerated.  But how true to Pascal’s\ntemper, as revealed in his work, that alarmed precipitous character\nin it!  Intellectually the abyss was evermore at his side.  Nous\navons, he observes, un autre principe d’erreur, les maladies.  Now in\nhim the imagination itself was like a physical malady, troubling,\ndisturbing, or in active collusion with it.  .  .  .",
