        "     Mendelssohn’s German Translation of the\n     Bible.–Phædo.–Jerusalem.–Lessing’s “Nathan the Wise.”",
        "Moses, the son of Mendel, was born in Dessau in 1728, and died in Berlin\nin 1786. His father was poor, and he himself was of a weak constitution.\nBut his stunted form was animated by a strenuous spirit. After a boyhood\npassed under conditions which did little to stimulate his dawning\naspirations, Mendelssohn resolved to follow his teacher Fränkel to\nBerlin. He trudged the whole way on foot, and was all but refused\nadmission into the Prussian capital, where he was destined to produce so\nprofound an impression. In Berlin his struggle with poverty continued,\nbut his condition was improved when he obtained a post, first as\nprivate tutor, then as book-keeper in a silk factory.",
        "Berlin was at this time the scene of an intellectual and æsthetic\nrevival dominated by Frederick the Great. The latter, a dilettante in\nculture, was, as Mendelssohn said of him, a man “who made the arts and\nsciences flourish, and made liberty of thought universal in his realm.\"\nThe German Jews were as yet outside this revival. In Italy and Holland\nthe new movements of the seventeenth and the eighteenth century had\nfound Jews well to the fore. But the “German” Jews–and this term\nincluded the great bulk of the Jews of Europe–were suffering from the\neffects of intellectual stagnation. The Talmud still exercised the mind\nand imagination of these Jews, but culture and religion were separated.\nMendelssohn in a hundred places contends that such separation is\ndangerous and unnatural. It was his service to Judaism that he made the\nseparation once for all obsolete.",
        "Mendelssohn effected this by purely literary means. Most reformations\nhave been at least aided by moral and political forces. But the\nMendelssohnian revival in Judaism was a literary revival, in which moral\nand religious forces had only an indirect influence. By the aid of\ngreater refinement of language, for hitherto the “German” Jews had not\nspoken pure German; by a widening of the scope of education in the\nJewish schools; by the introduction of all that is known as culture,\nMendelssohn changed the whole aspect of Jewish life. And he produced\nthis reformation by books and by books alone. Never playing the part of\na religious or moral reformer, Mendelssohn became the Jewish apostle of\nculture.",
        "The great event of his life occurred in 1754, when he made the\nacquaintance of Lessing. The two young men became constant friends.\nLessing, before he knew Mendelssohn, had written a drama, “The Jews,” in\nwhich, perhaps for the first time, a Jew was represented on the stage as\na man of honor. In Mendelssohn, Lessing recognized a new Spinoza; in\nLessing, Mendelssohn saw the perfect ideal of culture. The masterpiece\nof Lessing’s art, the drama “Nathan the Wise,” was the monument of this\nfriendship. Mendelssohn was the hero of the drama, and the toleration\nwhich it breathes is clearly Mendelssohn’s. Mendelssohn held that there\nwas no absolutely best religion any more than there was an absolutely\nbest form of government. This was the leading idea of his last work,\n“Jerusalem\"; it is also the central thought of “Nathan the Wise.” The\nbest religion, according to both, is the religion which best brings out\nthe individual’s noblest faculties. As Mendelssohn wrote, there are\ncertain eternal truths which God implants in all men alike, but “Judaism\nboasts of no exclusive revelation of immutable truths indispensable to\nsalvation.”",
        "What has just been quoted is one of the last utterances of Mendelssohn.\nWe must retrace our steps to the date of his first intimacy with\nLessing. He devoted his attention to the perfecting of his German style,\nand succeeded so well that his writings have gained a place among the\nclassics of German literature. In 1763, he won the Berlin prize for an\nessay on Mathematical Method in Philosophical Reasoning, and defeated\nKant entirely on account of his lucid and attractive style.\nMendelssohn’s most popular philosophical work, “Phædo, or the\nImmortality of the Soul,” won extraordinary popularity in Berlin, as\nmuch for its attractive form as for its spiritual charms. The “German\nPlato,” the “Jewish Socrates,” were some of the epithets bestowed on him\nby multitudes of admirers. Indeed, the “Phædo” of Mendelssohn is a work\nof rare beauty.",
        "One of the results of Mendelssohn’s popularity was a curious\ncorrespondence with Lavater. The latter perceived in Mendelssohn’s\ntoleration signs of weakness, and believed that he could convert the\nfamous Jew to Christianity. Mendelssohn’s reply, like his “Jerusalem\"\nand his admirable preface to a German translation of Manasseh ben\nIsrael’s Vindiciæ Judeorum, gave voice to that claim on personal\nliberty of thought and conscience for which the Jews, unconsciously, had\nbeen so long contending. Mendelssohn’s view was that all true religious\naspirations are independent of religious forms. Mendelssohn did not\nignore the value of forms, but he held that as there are often several\nmeans to the same end, so the various religious forms of the various\ncreeds may all lead their respective adherents to salvation and to God.",
        "Mendelssohn’s most epoch-making work was his translation of the\nPentateuch into German. With this work the present history finds a\nnatural close. Mendelssohn’s Pentateuch marks the modernization of the\nliterature of Judaism. There was much opposition to the book, but on the\nother hand many Jews eagerly scanned its pages, acquired its noble\ndiction, and committed its rhythmic eloquence to their hearts. Round\nMendelssohn there clustered a band of devoted disciples, the pioneers of\nthe new learning, the promoters of a literature of Judaism, in which the\nmodern spirit reanimated the still living records of antiquity. There\nwas certainly some weakness among the men and women affected by the\nBerlin philosopher, for some discarded all positive religion, because\nthe master had taught that all positive religions had their saving and\ntruthful elements.",
        "It is not, however, the province of this sketch to trace the religious\neffects of the Mendelssohnian movement. Suffice it to say that, while\nthe old Jewish conception had been that literature and life are\nco-extensive, Jewish literature begins with Mendelssohn to have an\nindependent life of its own, a life of the spirit, which cannot be\naltogether controlled by the tribulations of material life. A physical\nGhetto may once more be imposed on the Jews from without; an\nintellectual Ghetto imposed from within is hardly conceivable. Tolerance\ngave the modern spirit to Jewish literature, but intolerance cannot\nwithdraw it.",
