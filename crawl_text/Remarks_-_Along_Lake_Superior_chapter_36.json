        "I have just returned from a brief visit to Duluth. After strolling along\nthe Bay of Naples and watching old Vesuvius vomit red-hot mud, vapor and\nother campaign documents, Duluth is quite a change. The ice in the bay at\nDuluth was thirty-eight inches in depth when I left there the last week in\nMarch, and we rode across it with the utmost impunity. By the time these\nlines fall beneath the eye of the genial, courteous and urbane reader, the\nnew railroad bridge across the bay, over a mile and a half long, will have\nbeen completed, so that you may ride from Chicago to Duluth over the\nNorthwestern and Omaha railroads with great comfort. I would be glad to\ndigress here and tell about the beauty of the summer scenery along the\nOmaha road, and the shy and beautiful troutlet, and the dark and silent\nChippewa squawlet and her little bleached out pappooselet, were it not for\nthe unkind and cruel thrusts that I would invoke from the scenery cynic\nwho believes that a newspaper man’s opinions may be largely warped with a\npass.",
        "Duluth has been joked a good deal, but she stands it first-rate and takes\nit good naturedly. She claims 16,000 people, some of whom I met at the\nopera house there. If the rest of the 16,000 are as pleasant as those I\nconversed with that evening, Duluth must be a pleasant place to live in.\nDuluth has a very pleasant and beautiful opera house that seats 1,000\npeople. A few more could have elbowed their way into the opera house the\nevening that I spoke there, but they preferred to suffer on at home.",
        "Lake Superior is one of the largest aggregations of fresh wetness in the\nworld, if not the largest. When I stop to think that some day all this\ncold, cold water will have to be absorbed by mankind, it gives me a cramp\nin the geographical center.",
        "Around the west end of Lake Superior there is a string of towns which\nstretches along the shore for miles under one name or another, all waiting\nfor the boom to strike and make the northern Chicago. You cannot visit\nDuluth or Superior without feeling that at any moment the tide of trade\nwill rise and designate the point where the future metropolis of the\nnorthern lakes is to be. I firmly believe that this summer will decide it,\nand my guess is that what is now known as West Superior is to get the\nbenefit. For many years destiny has been hovering over the west end of\nthis mighty lake, and now the favored point is going to be designated.\nDuluth has past prosperity and expensive improvements in her favor, and in\nfact the whole locality is going to be benefited, but if I had a block in\nWest Superior with a roller rink on it, I would wear my best clothes every\nday and claim to be a millionaire in disguise. Ex-President R. B. Hayes\nhas a large brick block in Duluth, but he does not occupy it. Those who go\nto Duluth hoping to meet Mr. Hayes will be bitterly disappointed.",
        "The streams that run into Lake Superior are alive with trout, and next\nsummer I propose to go up there and roast until I have so thoroughly\nsaturated my system with trout that the trout bones will stick out through\nmy clothes in every direction and people will regard me as a beautiful\ntoothpick holder.",
        "Still there will be a few left for those who think of going up there. All\nI will need will be barely enough to feed Albert Victor and myself from\nday to day. People who have never seen a crowned head with a peeled nose\non it are cordially invited to come over and see us during office hours.\nAlbert is not at all haughty, and I intend to throw aside my usual reserve\nthis summer also–for the time. P. Wales’ son and I will be far from the\ncares that crowd so thick and fast on greatness. People who come to our\ncedar bark wigwam to show us their mosquito bites, will be received as\ncordially as though no great social chasm yawned between us.",
        "Many will meet us in the depths of the forest and go away thinking that we\nare just common plugs of whom the world wots not; but there is where they\nwill fool themselves.",
        "Then, when the season is over, we will come back into the great maelstrom\nof life, he to wait for his grandmother’s overshoes and I to thrill\nwaiting millions from the rostrum with my “Tale of the Broncho Cow.” And\nso it goes with us all. Adown life’s rugged pathway some must toil on from\ndaylight to dark to earn their meagre pittance as kings, while others are\nborn to wear a swallow-tail coat every evening and wring tears of genuine\nanguish from their audiences.",
        "They tell some rather wide stories about people who have gone up there\ntotal physical wrecks and returned strong and well. One man said that he\nknew a young college student, who was all run down and weak, go up there\non the Brule and eat trout and fight mosquitoes a few months, and when he\nreturned to his Boston home he was so stout and well and tanned up that\nhis parents did not know him. There was a man in our car who weighed 300\npounds. He seemed to be boiling out through his clothes everywhere. He was\nthe happiest looking man I ever saw. All he seemed to do in this life was\nto sit all day and whistle and laugh and trot his stomach, first on one\nknee and then on the other.",
        "He said that he went up into the pine forests of the Great Lake region a\nbroken-down hypochondriac and confirmed consumptive. He had been measured\nfor a funeral sermon three times, he said, and had never used either of\nthem. He knew a clergyman named Brayley who went up into that region with\nBright’s justly celebrated disease. He was so emaciated that he couldn’t\ncarry a watch. The ticking of the watch rattled his bones so that it made\nhim nervous, and at night they had to pack him in cotton so that he\nwouldn’t break a leg when he turned over. He got to sleeping out nights on\na bed of balsam and spruce boughs and eating venison and trout.",
        "When he came down in the spring, he passed through a car of lumbermen and\none of them put a warm, wet quid of tobacco in his plug hat for a joke.\nThere were a hundred of these lumbermen when the preacher began, and when\nthe train got into Eau Claire there were only three of them well enough to\ngo around to the office and draw their pay.",
        "This is just as the story was given to me and I repeat it to show how\nbracing the climate near Superior is. Remember, if you please, that I do\nnot want the story to be repeated as coming from me, for I have nothing\nleft now but my reputation for veracity, and that has had a very hard\nwinter of it.",
