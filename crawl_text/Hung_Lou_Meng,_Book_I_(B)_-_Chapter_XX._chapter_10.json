        "  Wang Hsi-feng with earnest words upbraids Mrs. Chao’s jealous notions.\n  Lin Tai-yü uses specious language to make sport of Shih Hsiang-yün’s\n      querulous tone of voice.",
        "But to continue. Pao-yü was in Tai yü’s apartments relating about the\nrat-elves, when Pao-ch’ai entered unannounced, and began to gibe Pao-yü,\nwith trenchant irony: how that on the fifteenth of the first moon, he\nhad shown ignorance of the allusion to the green wax; and the three of\nthem then indulged in that room in mutual poignant satire, for the sake\nof fun. Pao-yü had been giving way to solicitude lest Tai-yü should, by\nbeing bent upon napping soon after her meal, be shortly getting an\nindigestion, or lest sleep should, at night, be completely dispelled, as\nneither of these things were conducive to the preservation of good\nhealth, when luckily Pao-ch’ai walked in, and they chatted and laughed\ntogether; and when Lin Tai-yü at length lost all inclination to dose, he\nhimself then felt composed in his mind. But suddenly they heard\nclamouring begin in his room, and after they had all lent an ear and\nlistened, Lin Tai-yü was the first to smile and make a remark. “It’s\nyour nurse having a row with Hsi Jen!” she said. “Hsi Jen treats her\nwell enough, but that nurse of yours would also like to keep her well\nunder her thumb; she’s indeed an old dotard;” and Pao-yü was anxious to\ngo over at once, but Pao-ch’ai laid hold of him and kept him back,\nsuggesting: “It’s as well that you shouldn’t wrangle with your nurse,\nfor she’s quite stupid from old age; and it’s but fair, on the contrary,\nthat you should bear with her a little.”",
        "“I know all about that!” Pao-yü rejoined. But having concluded this\nremark, he walked into his room, where he discovered nurse Li, leaning\non her staff, standing in the centre of the floor, abusing Hsi Jen,\nsaying: “You young wench! how utterly unmindful you are of your origin!\nIt’s I who’ve raised you up, and yet, when I came just now, you put on\nhigh airs and mighty side, and remained reclining on the stove-couch!\nYou saw me well enough, but you paid not the least heed to me! Your\nwhole heart is set upon acting like a wily enchantress to befool Pao-yü;\nand you so impose upon Pao-yü that he doesn’t notice me, but merely\nlends an ear to what you people have to say! You’re no more than a low\ngirl bought for a few taels and brought in here; and will it ever do\nthat you should be up to your mischievous tricks in this room? But\nwhether you like it or not, I’ll drag you out from this, and give you to\nsome mean fellow, and we’ll see whether you will still behave like a\nvery imp, and cajole people or not?”",
        "Hsi Jen was, at first, under the simple impression that the nurse was\nwrath for no other reason than because she remained lying down, and she\nfelt constrained to explain that “she was unwell, that she had just\nsucceeded in perspiring, and that having had her head covered, she\nhadn’t really perceived the old lady;” but when she came subsequently to\nhear her mention that she imposed upon Pao-yü, and also go so far as to\nadd that she would be given to some mean fellow, she unavoidably\nexperienced both a sense of shame and injury, and found it impossible to\nrestrain herself from beginning to cry.",
        "Pao-yü had, it is true, caught all that had been said, but unable with\nany propriety to take notice of it, he thought it his duty to explain\nmatters for her. “She’s ill,” he observed, “and is taking medicines; and\nif you don’t believe it,” he went on, “well then ask the rest of the\nservant-girls.”",
        "Nurse Li at these words flew into a more violent dudgeon. “Your sole\ndelight is to screen that lot of sly foxes!” she remarked, “and do you\npay any notice to me? No, none at all! and whom would you like me to go\nand ask; who’s it that doesn’t back you? and who hasn’t been dismounted\nfrom her horse by Hsi Jen? I know all about it; but I’ll go with you and\nexplain all these matters to our old mistress and my lady; for I’ve\nnursed you till I’ve brought you to this age, and now that you don’t\nfeed on milk, you thrust me on one side, and avail yourself of the\nservant-girls, in your wish to browbeat me.”",
        "As she uttered this remark, she too gave way to tears, but by this time,\nTai-yü and Pao-ch’ai had also come over, and they set to work to\nreassure her. “You, old lady,” they urged, “should bear with them a\nlittle, and everything will be right!” And when nurse Li saw these two\narrive, she hastened to lay bare her grievances to them; and taking up\nthe question of the dismissal in days gone by, of Hsi Hsüeh, for having\ndrunk some tea, of the cream eaten on the previous day, and other\nsimilar matters, she spun a long, interminable yarn.",
        "By a strange coincidence lady Feng was at this moment in the upper\nrooms, where she had been making up the account of losses and winnings,\nand upon hearing at the back a continuous sound of shouting and\nbustling, she readily concluded that nurse Li’s old complaint was\nbreaking forth, and that she was finding fault with Pao-yü’s servants.\nBut she had, as luck would have it, lost money in gambling on this\noccasion, so that she was ready to visit her resentment upon others.\nWith hurried step, she forthwith came over, and laying hold of nurse Li,\n“Nurse,” she said smiling, “don’t lose your temper, on a great festival\nlike this, and after our venerable lady has just gone through a day in\nexcellent spirits! You’re an old dame, and should, when others get up a\nrow, still do what is right and keep them in proper order; and aren’t\nyou, instead of that, aware what good manners imply, that you will start\nvociferating in this place, and make our dowager lady full of\ndispleasure? Tell me who’s not good, and I’ll beat her for you; but be\nquick and come along with me over to my quarters, where a pheasant which\nthey have roasted is scalding hot, and let us go and have a glass of\nwine!” And as she spoke, she dragged her along and went on her way.\n“Feng Erh,” she also called, “hold the staff for your old lady Li, and\nthe handkerchief to wipe her tears with!” While nurse Li walked along\nwith lady Feng, her feet scarcely touched the ground, as she kept on\nsaying: “I don’t really attach any value to this decrepid existence of\nmine! and I had rather disregard good manners, have a row and lose face,\nas it’s better, it seems to me, than to put up with the temper of that\nwench!”",
        "Behind followed Pao-ch’ai and Tai-yü, and at the sight of the way in\nwhich lady Feng dealt with her, they both clapped their hands, and\nexclaimed, laughing, “What piece of luck that this gust of wind has\ncome, and dragged away this old matron!” while Pao-yü nodded his head to\nand fro and soliloquised with a sigh: “One can neither know whence\noriginates this score; for she will choose the weak one to maltreat; nor\ncan one see what girl has given her offence that she has come to be put\nin her black books!”",
        "Scarcely had he ended this remark, before Ch’ing Wen, who stood by, put\nin her word. “Who’s gone mad again?” she interposed, “and what good\nwould come by hurting her feelings? But did even any one happen to hurt\nher, she would have pluck enough to bear the brunt, and wouldn’t act so\nimproperly as to involve others!”",
        "Hsi Jen wept, and as she, did so, she drew Pao-yü towards her: “All\nthrough my having aggrieved an old nurse,” she urged, “you’ve now again\ngiven umbrage, entirely on my account, to this crowd of people; and\nisn’t this still enough for me to bear but must you also go and drag in\nthird parties?”",
        "When Pao-yü realised that to this sickness of hers, had also been\nsuperadded all these annoyances, he promptly stifled his resentment,\nsuppressed his voice and consoled her so far as to induce her to lie\ndown again to perspire. And when he further noticed how scalding like\nsoup and burning like fire she was, he himself watched by her, and\nreclining by her side, he tried to cheer her, saying: “All you must do\nis to take good care of your ailment; and don’t give your mind to those\ntrifling matters, and get angry.”",
        "“Were I,” Hsi Jen smiled sardonically, “to lose my temper over such\nconcerns, would I be able to stand one moment longer in this room? The\nonly thing is that if she goes on, day after day, doing nothing else\nthan clamour in this manner, how can she let people get along? But you\nrashly go and hurt people’s feelings for our sakes; but they’ll bear it\nin mind, and when they find an opportunity, they’ll come out with what’s\neasy enough to say, but what’s not pleasant to hear, and how will we all\nfeel then?”",
        "While her mouth gave utterance to these words, she could not stop her\ntears from running; but fearful, on the other hand, lest Pao-yü should\nbe annoyed, she felt compelled to again strain every nerve to repress\nthem. But in a short while, the old matrons employed for all sorts of\nduties, brought in some mixture of two drugs; and, as Pao-yü noticed\nthat she was just on the point of perspiring, he did not allow her to\nget up, but readily taking it up to her, she immediately swallowed it,\nwith her head still on her pillow; whereupon he gave speedy directions\nto the young servant-maids to lay her stove-couch in order.",
        "“Whether you mean to have anything to eat or not,” Hsi Jen advised, “you\nshould after all sit for a time with our old mistress and our lady, and\nhave a romp with the young ladies; after which you can come back again;\nwhile I, by quietly keeping lying down, will also feel the better.”",
        "When Pao-yü heard this suggestion, he had no help but to accede, and,\nafter she had divested herself of her hair-pins and earrings, and he saw\nher lie down, he betook himself into the drawing-rooms, where he had his\nrepast with old lady Chia. But the meal over, her ladyship felt still\ndisposed to play at cards with the nurses, who had looked after the\nhousehold for many years; and Pao-yü, bethinking himself of Hsi Jen,\nhastened to return to his apartments; where seeing that Hsi Jen was\ndrowsily falling asleep, he himself would have wished to go to bed, but\nthe hour was yet early. And as about this time Ch’ing Wen, I Hsia, Ch’in\nWen, Pi Hen had all, in their desire of getting some excitement, started\nin search of Yüan Yang, Hu Po and their companions, to have a romp with\nthem, and he espied She Yüeh alone in the outer room, having a game of\ndominoes by lamp-light, Pao-yü inquired full of smiles: “How is it you\ndon’t go with them?”",
        "“I’ve no money,” She Yüeh replied.",
        "“Under the bed,” continued Pao-yü, “is heaped up all that money, and\nisn’t it enough yet for you to lose from?”",
        "“Had we all gone to play,” She Yüeh added, “to whom would the charge of\nthis apartment have been handed over? That other one is sick again, and\nthe whole room is above, one mass of lamps, and below, full of fire; and\nall those old matrons, ancient as the heavens, should, after all their\nexertions in waiting upon you from morning to night, be also allowed\nsome rest; while the young servant girls, on the other hand, have\nlikewise been on duty the whole day long, and shouldn’t they even at\nthis hour be left to go and have some distraction? and that’s why I am\nin here on watch.”",
        "When Pao-yü heard these words, which demonstrated distinctly that she\nwas another Hsi Jen, he consequently put on a smile and remarked: “I’ll\nsit in here, so you had better set your mind at ease and go!”",
        "“Since you remain in here, there’s less need for me to go,” resumed She\nYüeh, “for we two can chat and play and laugh; and won’t that be nice?”",
        "“What can we two do? it will be awfully dull! but never mind,” Pao-yü\nrejoined; “this morning you said that your head itched, and now that you\nhave nothing to do, I may as well comb it for you.”",
        "“Yes! do so!” readily assented She Yüeh, upon catching what he\nsuggested; and while still speaking, she brought over the dressing-case\ncontaining a set of small drawers and looking-glass, and taking off her\nornaments, she dishevelled her hair; whereupon Pao-yü picked up the fine\ncomb and passed it repeatedly through her hair; but he had only combed\nit three or five times, when he perceived Ch’ing Wen hurriedly walk in\nto fetch some money. As soon as she caught sight of them both: “You\nhaven’t as yet drunk from the marriage cup,” she said with a smile full\nof irony, “and have you already put up your hair?”",
        "“Now that you’ve come, let me also comb yours for you,” Pao-yü\ncontinued.",
        "“I’m not blessed with such excessive good fortune!” Ch’ing Wen retorted,\nand as she uttered these words, she took the money, and forthwith\ndashing the portiere after her, she quitted the room.",
        "Pao-yü stood at the back of She Yüeh, and She Yüeh sat opposite the\nglass, so that the two of them faced each other in it, and Pao-yü\nreadily observed as he gazed in the glass, “In the whole number of rooms\nshe’s the only one who has a glib tongue!”",
        "She Yüeh at these words hastily waved her hand towards the inside of the\nglass, and Pao-yü understood the hint; and suddenly a sound of “hu” was\nheard from the portiere, and Ch’ing Wen ran in once again.",
        "“How have I got a glib tongue?” she inquired; “it would be well for us\nto explain ourselves.”",
        "“Go after your business, and have done,” She Yüeh interposed laughingly;\n“what’s the use of your coming and asking questions of people?”",
        "“Will you also screen him?” Ch’ing Wen smiled significantly; “I know all\nabout your secret doings, but wait until I’ve got back my capital, and\nwe’ll then talk matters over!”",
        "With this remark still on her lips, she straightway quitted the room,\nand during this while, Pao-yü having finished combing her hair, asked\nShe Yüeh to quietly wait upon him, while he went to sleep, as he would\nnot like to disturb Hsi Jen.\r\n\r\nOf the whole night there is nothing to record. But the next day, when he\ngot up at early dawn, Hsi Jen had already perspired, during the night,\nso that she felt considerably lighter and better; but limiting her diet\nto a little rice soup, she remained quiet and nursed herself, and Pao-yü\nwas so relieved in mind that he came, after his meal, over on this side\nto his aunt Hsüeh’s on a saunter. The season was the course of the first\nmoon, and the school was shut up for the new year holidays; while in the\ninner chambers the girls had put by their needlework, and were all\nhaving a time of leisure, and hence it was that when Chia Huan too came\nover in search of distraction, he discovered Pao-ch’ai, Hsiang Ling,\nYing Erh, the three of them, in the act of recreating themselves by\nplaying at chess. Chia Huan, at the sight of them, also wished to join\nin their games; and Pao-ch’ai, who had always looked upon him with, in\nfact, the same eye as she did Pao-yü, and with no different sentiment of\nany kind, pressed him to come up, upon hearing that he was on this\noccasion desirous to play; and, when he had seated himself together with\nthem, they began to gamble, staking each time a pile of ten cash. The\nfirst time, he was the winner, and he felt supremely elated at heart,\nbut as it happened that he subsequently lost in several consecutive\ngames he soon became a prey to considerable distress. But in due course\ncame the game in which it was his turn to cast the dice, and, if in\nthrowing, he got seven spots, he stood to win, but he was likewise bound\nto be a winner were he to turn up six; and when Ying Erh had turned up\nthree spots and lost, he consequently took up the dice, and dashing them\nwith spite, one of them settled at five; and, as the other reeled wildly\nabout, Ying Erh clapped her hands, and kept on shouting, “one spot;\"\nwhile Chia Huan at once gazed with fixed eye and cried at random: “It’s\nsix, it’s seven, it’s eight!” But the dice, as it happened, turned up at\none spot, and Chia Huan was so exasperated that putting out his hand, he\nspeedily made a snatch at the dice, and eventually was about to lay hold\nof the money, arguing that it was six spot. But Ying Erh expostulated,\n“It was distinctly an ace,” she said. And as Pao-ch’ai noticed how\ndistressed Chia Huan was, she forthwith cast a glance at Ying Erh and\nobserved: “The older you get, the less manners you have! Is it likely\nthat gentlemen will cheat you? and don’t you yet put down the money?”",
        "Ying Erh felt her whole heart much aggrieved, but as she heard Pao-ch’ai\nmake these remarks, she did not presume to utter a sound, and as she was\nunder the necessity of laying down the cash, she muttered to herself:\n“This one calls himself a gentleman, and yet cheats us of these few\ncash, for which I myself even have no eye! The other day when I played\nwith Mr. Pao-yü, he lost ever so many, and yet he did not distress\nhimself! and what remained of the cash were besides snatched away by a\nfew servant-girls, but all he did was to smile, that’s all!”",
        "Pao-ch’ai did not allow her time to complete what she had to say, but\nthere and then called her to account and made her desist; whereupon Chia\nHuan exclaimed: “How can I compare with Pao-yü; you all fear him, and\nkeep on good terms with him, while you all look down upon me for not\nbeing the child of my lady.” And as he uttered these words, he at once\ngave way to tears.",
        "“My dear cousin,” Pao-ch’ai hastened to advise him, “leave off at once\nlanguage of this kind, for people will laugh at you;” and then went on\nto scold Ying Erh, when Pao-yü just happened to come in. Perceiving him\nin this plight, “What is the matter?” he asked; but Chia Huan had not\nthe courage to say anything.",
        "Pao-ch’ai was well aware of the custom, which prevailed in their family,\nthat younger brothers lived in respect of the elder brothers, but she\nwas not however cognisant of the fact that Pao-yü would not that any one\nshould entertain any fear of him. His idea being that elder as well as\nyounger brothers had, all alike, father and mother to admonish them, and\nthat there was no need for any of that officiousness, which, instead of\ndoing good gave, on the contrary, rise to estrangement. “Besides,” (he\nreasoned,) “I’m the offspring of the primary wife, while he’s the son of\nthe secondary wife, and, if by treating him as leniently as I have done,\nthere are still those to talk about me, behind my back, how could I\nexercise any control over him?” But besides these, there were other\nstill more foolish notions, which he fostered in his mind; but what\nfoolish notions they were can you, reader, guess? As a result of his\ngrowing up, from his early youth, among a crowd of girls, of whom, in\nthe way of sister, there was Yüan Ch’un, of cousins, from his paternal\nuncle’s side, there were Ying Ch’un, and Hsi Ch’un, and of relatives\nalso there were Shih Hsiang-yün, Lin Tai-yü, Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai and the\nrest, he, in due course, resolved in his mind that the divine and\nunsullied virtue of Heaven and earth was only implanted in womankind,\nand that men were no more than feculent dregs and foul dirt. And for\nthis reason it was that men were without discrimination, considered by\nhim as so many filthy objects, which might or might not exist; while the\nrelationships of father, paternal uncles, and brothers, he did not\nhowever presume to disregard, as these were among the injunctions\nbequeathed by the holy man, and he felt bound to listen to a few of\r\ntheir precepts. But to the above causes must be assigned the fact that,\namong his brothers, he did no more than accomplish the general purport\nof the principle of human affections; bearing in mind no thought\nwhatever that he himself was a human being of the male sex, and that it\nwas his duty to be an example to his younger brothers. And this is why\nChia Huan and the others entertained no respect for him, though in their\nveneration for dowager lady Chia, they yielded to him to a certain\ndegree.",
        "Pao-ch’ai harboured fears lest, on this occasion, Pao-yü should call him\nto book, and put him out of face, and she there and then lost no time in\ntaking Chia Huan’s part with a view to screening him.",
        "“In this felicitous first moon what are you blubbering for?” Pao-yü\ninquired, “if this place isn’t nice, why then go somewhere else to play.\nBut from reading books, day after day, you’ve studied so much that\nyou’ve become quite a dunce. If this thing, for instance, isn’t good,\nthat must, of course, be good, so then discard this and take up that,\nbut is it likely that by sticking to this thing and crying for a while\nthat it will become good? You came originally with the idea of reaping\nsome fun, and you’ve instead provoked yourself to displeasure, and isn’t\nit better then that you should be off at once.”",
        "Chia Huan upon hearing these words could not but come back to his\nquarters; and Mrs. Chao noticing the frame of mind in which he was felt\nconstrained to inquire: “Where is it that you’ve been looked down upon\nby being made to fill up a hole, and being trodden under foot?”",
        "“I was playing with cousin Pao-ch’ai,” Chia Huan readily replied, “when\nYing Erh insulted me, and deprived me of my money, and brother Pao-yü\ndrove me away.”",
        "“Ts’ui!” exclaimed Mrs. Chao, “who bade you (presume so high) as to get\nup into that lofty tray? You low and barefaced thing! What place is\nthere that you can’t go to and play; and who told you to run over there\nand bring upon yourself all this shame?”",
        "As she spoke, lady Feng was, by a strange coincidence, passing outside\nunder the window; so that every word reached her ear, and she speedily\nasked from outside the window: “What are you up to in this happy first\nmoon? These brothers are, really, but mere children, and will you just\nfor a slight mistake, go on preaching to him! what’s the use of coming\nout with all you’ve said? Let him go wherever he pleases; for there are\nstill our lady and Mr. Chia Cheng to keep him in order. But you go and\nsputter him with your gigantic mouth; he’s at present a master, and if\nthere be anything wrong about him, there are, after all, those to rate\nhim; and what business is that of yours? Brother Huan, come out with\nyou, and follow me and let us go and enjoy ourselves.”",
        "Chia Huan had ever been in greater fear and trembling of lady Feng, than\nof madame Wang, so that when her summons reached his ear, he hurriedly\nwent out, while Mrs. Chao, on the other hand, did not venture to breathe\na single word.",
        "“You too,” resumed lady Feng, addressing Chia Huan; “are a thing devoid\nof all natural spirit! I’ve often told you that if you want to eat,\ndrink, play, or laugh, you were quite free to go and play with whatever\nfemale cousin, male cousin, or sister-in-law you choose to disport\nyourself with; but you won’t listen to my words. On the contrary, you\nlet all these persons teach you to be depraved in your heart, perverse\nin your mind, to be sly, artful, and domineering; and you’ve, besides,\nno respect for your own self, but will go with that low-bred lot! and\nyour perverse purpose is to begrudge people’s preferences! But what\nyou’ve lost are simply a few cash, and do you behave in this manner? How\nmuch did you lose?” she proceeded to ask Chia Huan; and Chia Huan, upon\nhearing this question, felt constrained to obey, by saying something in\nthe way of a reply. “I’ve lost,” he explained, “some hundred or two\nhundred cash.”",
        "“You have,” rejoined lady Feng, “the good fortune of being a gentleman,\nand do you make such a fuss for the loss of a hundred or two hundred\ncash!” and turning her head round, “Feng Erh,” she added, “go and fetch\na thousand cash; and as the girls are all playing at the back, take him\nalong to go and play. And if again by and by, you’re so mean and\ndeceitful, I shall, first of all, beat you, and then tell some one to\nreport it at school, and won’t your skin be flayed for you? All because\nof this want of respect of yours, your elder cousin is so angry with you\nthat his teeth itch; and were it not that I prevent him, he would hit\nyou with his foot in the stomach and kick all your intestines out! Get\naway,” she then cried; whereupon Chia Huan obediently followed Feng Erh,\nand taking the money he went all by himself to play with Ying Ch’un and\nthe rest; where we shall leave him without another word.",
        "But to return to Pao-yü. He was just amusing himself and laughing with\nPao-ch’ai, when at an unexpected moment, he heard some one announce that\nMiss Shih had come. At these words, Pao-yü rose, and was at once going\noff when “Wait,” shouted Pao-ch’ai with a smile, “and we’ll go over\ntogether and see her.”",
        "Saying this, she descended from the stove-couch, and came, in company\nwith Pao-yü, to dowager lady Chia’s on this side, where they saw Shih\nHsiang-yün laughing aloud, and talking immoderately; and upon catching\nsight of them both, she promptly inquired after their healths, and\nexchanged salutations.",
        "Lin Tai-yü just happened to be standing by, and having set the question\nto Pao-yü “Where do you come from?” “I come from cousin Pao-ch’ai’s\nrooms,” Pao-yü readily replied.",
        "Tai-yü gave a sardonic smile. “What I maintain is this,” she rejoined,\n“that lucky enough for you, you were detained over there; otherwise, you\nwould long ago have, at once, come flying in here!”",
        "“Am I only free to play with you?” Pao-yü inquired, “and to dispel your\nennui! I simply went over to her place for a run, and that quite\ncasually, and will you insinuate all these things?”",
        "“Your words are quite devoid of sense,” Tai-yü added; “whether you go or\nnot what’s that to me? neither did I tell you to give me any\ndistraction; you’re quite at liberty from this time forth not to pay any\nnotice to me!”",
        "Saying this, she flew into a high dudgeon and rushed back into her room;\nbut Pao-yü promptly followed in her footsteps: “Here you are again in a\nhuff,” he urged, “and all for no reason! Had I even passed any remark\nthat I shouldn’t, you should anyhow have still sat in there, and chatted\nand laughed with the others for a while; instead of that, you come again\nto sit and mope all alone!”",
        "“Are you my keeper?” Tai-yü expostulated.",
        "“I couldn’t, of course,” Pao-yü smiled, “presume to exercise any\ninfluence over you; but the only thing is that you are doing your own\nhealth harm!”",
        "“If I do ruin my health,” Tai-yü rejoined, “and I die, it’s my own\nlookout! what’s that to do with you?”",
        "“What’s the good,” protested Pao-yü, “of talking in this happy first\nmoon of dying and of living?”",
        "“I will say die,” insisted Tai-yü, “die now, at this very moment!\nbut you’re afraid of death; and you may live a long life of a hundred\nyears, but what good will that be!”",
        "“If all we do is to go on nagging in this way,” Pao-yü remarked smiling,\n“will I any more be afraid to die? on the contrary, it would be better\nto die, and be free!”",
        "“Quite so!” continued Tai-yü with alacrity, “if we go on nagging in this\nway, it would be better for me to die, and that you should be free of\nme!”",
        "“I speak of my own self dying,” Pao-yü added, “so don’t misunderstand my\nwords and accuse people wrongly.”",
        "While he was as yet speaking, Pao-ch’ai entered the room: “Cousin Shih\nis waiting for you;” she said; and with these words, she hastily pushed\nPao-yü on, and they walked away.",
        "Tai-yü, meanwhile, became more and more a prey to resentment; and\ndisconsolate as she felt, she shed tears in front of the window. But not\ntime enough had transpired to allow two cups of tea to be drunk, before\nPao-yü came back again. At the sight of him, Tai-yü sobbed still more\nfervently and incessantly, and Pao-yü realising the state she was in,\nand knowing well enough how arduous a task it would be to bring her\nround, began to join together a hundred, yea a thousand kinds of soft\nphrases and tender words to console her. But at an unforeseen moment,\nand before he could himself open his mouth, he heard Tai-yü anticipate\nhim.",
        "“What have you come back again for?” she asked. “Let me die or live, as\nI please, and have done! You’ve really got at present some one to play\nwith you, one who, compared with me, is able to read and able to\ncompose, able to write, to speak, as well as to joke, one too who for\nfear lest you should have ruffled your temper dragged you away: and what\ndo you return here for now?”",
        "Pao-yü, after listening to all she had to say, hastened to come up to\nher. “Is it likely,” he observed in a low tone of voice, “that an\nintelligent person like you isn’t so much as aware that near relatives\ncan’t be separated by a distant relative, and a remote friend set aside\nan old friend! I’m stupid, there’s no gainsaying, but I do anyhow\nunderstand what these two sentiments imply. You and I are, in the first\nplace, cousins on my father’s sister’s side; while sister Pao-ch’ai and\nI are two cousins on mother’s sides, so that, according to the degrees\nof relationship, she’s more distant than yourself. In the second place,\nyou came here first, and we two have our meals at one table and sleep in\none bed, having ever since our youth grown up together; while she has\nonly recently come, and how could I ever distance you on her account?”",
        "“Ts’ui!” Tai-yü exclaimed. “Will I forsooth ever make you distance her!\nwho and what kind of person have I become to do such a thing? What (I\nsaid) was prompted by my own motives.”",
        "“I too,” Pao-yü urged, “made those remarks prompted by my own heart’s\nmotives, and do you mean to say that your heart can only read the\nfeelings of your own heart, and has no idea whatsoever of my own?”",
        "Tai-yü at these words, lowered her head and said not a word. But after a\nlong interval, “You only know,” she continued, “how to feel bitter\nagainst people for their action in censuring you: but you don’t, after\nall, know that you yourself provoke people to such a degree, that it’s\nhard for them to put up with it! Take for instance the weather of to-day\nas an example. It’s distinctly very cold, to-day, and yet, how is it\nthat you are so contrary as to go and divest yourself of the pelisse\nwith the bluish breast-fur overlapping the cloth?”",
        "“Why say I didn’t wear it?” Pao-yü smilingly observed. “I did, but\nseeing you get angry I felt suddenly in such a terrible blaze, that I at\nonce took it off!”",
        "Tai-yü heaved a sigh. “You’ll by and by catch a cold,” she remarked,\n“and then you’ll again have to starve, and vociferate for something to\neat!”",
        "While these two were having this colloquy, Hsiang-yün was seen to walk\nin! “You two, Ai cousin and cousin Lin,” she ventured jokingly, “are\ntogether playing every day, and though I’ve managed to come after ever\nso much trouble, you pay no heed to me at all!”",
        "“It’s invariably the rule,” Tai-yü retorted smilingly, “that those who\nhave a defect in their speech will insist upon talking; she can’t even\ncome out correctly with ’Erh’ (secundus) cousin, and keeps on calling\nhim ’Ai’ cousin, ’Ai’ cousin! And by and by when you play ’Wei Ch’i’\nyou’re sure also to shout out yao, ai, (instead of erh), san; (one, two,\nthree).”",
        "Pao-yü laughed. “If you imitate her,” he interposed, “and get into that\nhabit, you’ll also begin to bite your tongue when you talk.”",
        "“She won’t make even the slightest allowance for any one,” Hsiang-yün\nrejoined; “her sole idea being to pick out others’ faults. You may\nreadily be superior to any mortal being, but you shouldn’t, after all,\noffend against what’s right and make fun of every person you come\nacross! But I’ll point out some one, and if you venture to jeer her,\nI’ll at once submit to you.”",
        "“Who is it?” Tai-yü vehemently inquired.",
        "“If you do have the courage,” Hsiang-yün answered, “to pick out cousin\nPao-ch’ai’s faults, you then may well be held to be first-rate!”",
        "Tai-yü after hearing these words, gave a sarcastic smile. “I was\nwondering,” she observed, “who it was. Is it indeed she? How could I\never presume to pick out hers?”",
        "Pao-yü allowed her no time to finish, but hastened to say something to\ninterrupt the conversation.",
        "“I couldn’t, of course, during the whole of this my lifetime,\"\nHsiang-yün laughed, “attain your standard! but my earnest wish is that\nby and by should be found for you, cousin Lin, a husband, who bites his\ntongue when he speaks, so that you should every minute and second listen\nto ’ai-ya-os!’ O-mi-to-fu, won’t then your reward be manifest to my\neyes!”",
        "As she made this remark, they all burst out laughing heartily, and\nHsiang-yün speedily turned herself round and ran away.",
        "But reader, do you want to know the sequel? Well, then listen to the\nexplanation given in the next chapter.",
