        "A few evenings later, Del, in a less strained, less despondent frame of\nmind, coming home from supper at her mother’s, found Estelle Wilmot on\nthe front veranda talking with Lorry Tague. She had seen this same sight\nperhaps half-a-dozen times since Estelle and Arden had come to stop with\nher at the Villa d’Orsay. On this particular evening his manner toward\nEstelle was no different from what it had been the other times; yet, as\nDel approached them, she felt the electric atmosphere which so often\nenvelops two who love each other, and betrays their secret carefully\nguarded behind formal manner and indifferent look and tone. She wondered\nthat she had been blind to what was now obvious.",
        "“Well, Arthur has at last compelled you to go to work,” said she\nsmilingly to the big cooper with the waving tawny hair and the keen, kind\ngray eyes. Then, to show her respect for the secret, she said to Estelle,\n“Perhaps he hasn’t told you that he was made superintendent of the\ncooperage to-day?”",
        "Estelle blushed a little, her eyes dancing. “He was just telling me,\"\nreplied she.",
        "“I understand why you yielded,” continued Adelaide to Lorry. “Arthur has\nbeen showing me the plans for the new factories. Gardens all round, big\nwindows, high ceilings, everything done by electricity, no smoke or soot,\na big swimming pool for winter or summer, a big restaurant, dressing\nrooms–everything! Who’d have believed that work could be carried on in\nsuch surroundings?”",
        "“It’s about time, isn’t it,” said Lorry, in his slow, musical voice,\n“that idleness was deprived of its monopoly of comforts and luxuries?”",
        "“How sensible that is!” said Del admiringly. “Yet nobody thinks of it.”",
        "“Why,” Lorry went on, “the day’ll come when they’ll look back on the way\nwe work nowadays, as we do on the time when a lot of men never went out\nto work except in chains and with keepers armed with lashes. The fellows\nthat call Dory and Arthur crazy dreamers don’t realize what ignorant\nsavages they themselves are.”",
        "“They have no imagination,” said Estelle.",
        "“No imagination,” echoed Lorry. “That’s the secret of the stupidity and\nthe horror of change, and of the notion that the way a thing’s done\nto-day is the way it’ll always be done.”",
        "“I’m afraid Arthur is going to get himself into even deeper trouble when\nthese new plans are announced,” said Del.",
        "Arthur’s revolution had already inflamed the other manufacturers at Saint\nX against him. Huge incomes were necessary to the support of their\nextravagant families and to the increase of the fortunes they were piling\nup “to save their children from fear of want\"–as if that same “fear of\nwant” were not the only known spur to the natural lethargy of the human\nanimal! They explained to their workmen that the university industries\nwere not business enterprises at all, and therefore must not be confused\nand compared with enterprises that were “practical\"; but the workmen\nfixed tenaciously upon the central fact that the university’s men worked\nat mechanical labor fewer hours each day by four to seven, and even\neight, got higher wages, got more out of life in every way. Nor was there\nany of the restraint and degradation of the “model town.” The workers\ncould live and act as they pleased; it was by the power of an intelligent\npublic opinion that Arthur was inducing his fellows and their families to\nbuild for themselves attractive homes, to live in tasteful comfort, to\nacquire sane habits of eating, drinking, and personal appearance. And no\none was more amazed than himself at the swiftness with which the\noverwhelming majority responded to the opportunity. Small wonder that\nthe other manufacturers, who at best never went beyond the crafty,\ninexpensive schemes of benevolent charity, were roaring against the\nuniversity as a “hotbed of anarchy.”",
        "At Adelaide’s suggestion of the outburst that would follow the new and\nstill more “inflammatory” revolution, Lorry shrugged his shoulders and\nlaughed easily. “Nobody need worry for that brother of yours, Mrs.\nHargrave,” said he. “There may be some factories for sale cheap before\nmany years. If so, the university can buy them in and increase its\nusefulness. Dory and Arthur are going to have a university that will be\nup to the name before they get through–one for all ages and kinds, and\nboth sexes, and for everybody all his life long and in all his\nrelations.”",
        "“It’s a beautiful dream,” said Del. She was remembering how Dory used to\nenlarge upon it in Paris until his eloquence made her feel that she loved\nhim at the same time that it also gave her a chilling sense of his being\nfar from her, too big and impersonal for so intimate and personal a thing\nas the love she craved. “A beautiful dream,” she repeated with a sigh.",
        "“That’s the joy of life,” said Estelle, “isn’t it? To have beautiful\ndreams, and to help make them come true.”",
        "“And this one is actually coming true,” said Lorry. “Wait a few years,\nonly a few, and you’ll see the discoveries of science make everything so\ncheap that vulgar, vain people will give up vulgarity and vanity in\ndespair. A good many of the once aristocratic vulgarities have been\ncheapened into absurdity already. The rest will follow.”",
        "“Only a few years?” said Del, laughing, yet more than half-convinced.",
        "“Use your imagination, Mrs. Hargrave,” replied Lorry, in his large,\ngood-humored way. “Don’t be afraid to be sensible just because most\npeople look on common sense as insanity. A hundred things that used to be\nluxuries for the king alone are now so cheap that the day-laborer has\nthem–all in less than two lifetimes of real science! To-morrow or next\nday some one will discover, say, the secret of easily and cheaply\ninterchanging the so-called elements. Bang! the whole structure of\nswagger and envy will collapse!”",
        "They all laughed, and Del went into the house. “Estelle–no woman, no\nmatter who–could hope to get a better husband than Lorry,” she was\nthinking. “And, now that he’s superintendent, there’s no reason why they\nshouldn’t marry. What a fine thing, what an American thing, that a man\nwith no chance at all in the start should be able to develop himself so\nthat a girl like Estelle could–yes, and should–be proud of his love and\nproud to love him.” She recalled how Lorry at the high school was about\nthe most amusing of the boys, with the best natural manner, and far and\naway the best dancer; how he used to be invited everywhere, until\nexcitement about fashion and “family” reached Saint X; how he was then\ngradually dropped until he, realizing what was the matter, haughtily\n“cut” all his former friends and associates. “We’ve certainly been racing\ndownhill these last few years. Where the Wilmots used to be about the\nonly silly people in town, there are scores of families now with noses in\nthe air and eyes looking eagerly about for chances to snub. But, on the\nother hand, there’s the university, and Arthur–and Dory.” She dismissed\nLorry and Estelle and Saint X’s fashionable strivings and, in the\nlibrary, sat down to compose a letter to Dory–no easy task in those\ndays, when there were seething in her mind and heart so much that she\nlonged to tell him but ought not, so much that she ought to tell but\ncould not.",
        "Lorry had acted as if he were about to depart, while Adelaide was there;\nhe resumed his seat on the steps at Estelle’s feet as soon as she\ndisappeared. “I suppose I ought to go,” said he, with a humorous glance\nup at her face with its regular features and steadfast eyes.",
        "She ran her slim fingers through his hair, let the tips of them linger an\ninstant on his lips before she took her hand away.",
        "“I couldn’t let you go just yet,” said she slowly, absently. “This is the\nclimax of the day. In this great, silent, dim light all my dreams–all\nour dreams–seem to become realities and to be trooping down from the sky\nto make us happy.”",
        "A pause, then he: “I can see them now.” But soon he moved to rise. “It\nfrightens me to be as happy as I am this evening. I must go, dear. We’re\ngetting bolder and bolder. First thing you know, your brother will be\nsuspecting–and that means your mother.”",
        "“I don’t seem to care any more,” replied the girl. “Mother is really in\nmuch better health, and has got pretty well prepared to expect almost\nanything from me. She has become resigned to me as a ’working person.’\nThen, too, I’m thoroughly inoculated with the habit of doing as I please.\nI guess that’s from being independent and having my own money. What a\ngood thing money is!”",
        "“So long as it means independence,” suggested Lorry; “but not after it\nmeans dependence.”",
        "But Estelle was thinking of their future. The delay, the seemingly\nendless delay, made her even more impatient than it made him, as is\nalways the case where the woman is really in love. In the man love holds\nthe impetuosity of passion in leash; in the woman it rouses the deeper,\nthe more enduring force of the maternal instinct–not merely the\nunconscious or, at most, half-conscious longing for the children that are\nto be, but the desire to do for the man–to look after his health, his\nphysical comfort, to watch over and protect him; for, to the woman in\nlove, the man seems in those humble ways less strong than she–a helpless\ncreature, dependent on her. “It’s going to be much harder to wait,” said\nshe, “now that you are superintendent and I have bought out Mrs.\nHastings’s share of my business.”",
        "They both laughed, but Lorry said: “It’s no joke. A little too much money\nhas made fools of as wise people as we are–many and many’s the time.”",
        "“Not as wise a person as you are, and as you’ll always make me be, or\nseem to be,” replied Estelle.",
        "Lorry pressed his big hand over hers for an instant. “Now that I’ve left\noff real work,” said he, “I’ll soon be able to take your hand without\ngiving you a rough reminder of the difference between us.”",
        "He held out his hands, palms upward. They were certainly not soft and\nsmooth, but they more than made up in look of use and strength what they\nlacked in smoothness. She put her small hands one on either side of his,\nand they both thrilled with the keen pleasure the touch of edge of hand\nagainst edge of hand gave them. In the ends of her fingers were the marks\nof her needlework. He bent and kissed those slightly roughened finger\nends passionately. “I love those marks!” he exclaimed. “They make me feel\nthat we belong to each other.”",
        "“I’d be sorry to see your hands different,” said she, her eyes shining\nupon his. “There are many things you don’t understand about me–for\ninstance, that it’s just those marks of work that make you so dear to me.\nA woman may begin by liking a man because he’s her ideal in certain ways,\nbut once she really cares, she loves whatever is part of him.”",
        "In addition to the reasons she had given for feeling “bolder” about her\n“plebeian” lover, there was another that was the strongest of all. A few\nmonths before, a cousin of her father’s had died in Boston, where he was\nthe preacher of a most exclusive and fashionable church. He had endeared\nhimself to his congregation by preaching one Easter Sunday a sermon\ncalled “The Badge of Birth.” In it he proceeded to show from the\nScriptures themselves how baseless was the common theory that Jesus was\nof lowly origin. “The common people heard Him gladly,” cried the Rev.\nEliot Wilmot, “because they instinctively felt His superiority of birth,\nfelt the dominance of His lineage. In His veins flowed the blood of the\nroyal house of Israel, the blood of the first anointed kings of Almighty\nGod.” And from this interesting premise the Reverend Wilmot deduced the\ndivine intent that the “best blood” should have superior\nrights–leadership, respect, deference. So dear was he to his flock that\nthey made him rich in this world’s goods as well as in love and honor.\nThe Wilmots of Saint X had had lively expectations from his estate. They\nthought that one holding the views eloquently set forth in “The Badge of\nBirth” must dedicate his fortune to restoring the dignity and splendor of\nthe main branch of the Wilmot family. But, like all their dreams, this\ncame to naught. His fortune went to a theological seminary to endow\nscholarships and fellowships for decayed gentlemen’s sons; he remembered\nonly Verbena Wilmot. On his one visit to the crumbling, weed-choked seat\nof the head of the house, he had seen Verbena’s wonderful hands, so\nprecious and so useless that had she possessed rings and deigned to wear\nthem she would not have permitted the fingers of the one hand to put them\non the fingers of the other. The legacy was five thousand dollars, at\nfour per cent., an income of two hundred dollars a year. Verbena invested\nthe first quarterly installment in a long-dreamed-of marble reproduction\nof her right hand which, after years of thinking daily about the matter,\nshe had decided was a shade more perfect than the left.",
        "If one dim eye makes a man king among blind men–to translate to the\nvernacular Verbena’s elegant reasoning–an income, however trifling, if\nit have no taint of toil, no stench of sweat upon it, makes its possessor\nentitled to royal consideration in a family of paupers and dead beats,\ndegraded by harboring a breadwinner of an Estelle. No sudden recipient of\na dazzling, drenching shower of wealth was ever more exalted than was\nVerbena, once in possession of ’my legacy.” Until the Rev. Eliot\nWilmot’s posthumous blessing descended upon her, the Wilmots lived\ntogether in comparative peace and loving kindness. They were all, except\nfor their mania of genealogy, good-humored, extremely well-mannered\npeople, courteous as much by nature as by deliberate intent. But, with\nthe coming of the blessing, peace and friendliness in that family were at\nan end. Old Preston Wilmot and Arden railed unceasingly against the\n“traitor” Eliot; Verbena defended him. Their mother and Estelle were\ndrawn into the battle from time to time, Estelle always against her will.\nBefore Verbena had been a woman of property three months, she was hating\nher father and brother for their sneers and insults, Arden had gone back\nto drinking, and the old gentleman was in a savage and most ungentlemanly\nhumor from morning until night.",
        "Estelle, the “black sheep” ever since she began to support them by\nengaging in trade, drew aloof now, was at home as little as she could\ncontrive, often ate a cold supper in the back of her shop. She said\nnothing to Lorry of the family shame; she simply drew nearer to him. And\nout of this changed situation came, unconsciously to herself, a deep\ncontempt for her father and her brother, a sense that she was indeed as\nalien as the Wilmots so often alleged, in scorn of her and her shop;\nVerbena’s income went to buy adornments for herself, dresses that would\ngive the hands a fitting background; Estelle’s earnings went to her\nmother, who distributed them, the old gentleman and Arden ignoring whence\nand how the money came.",
        "As Estelle and Lorry lingered on the porch of the Villa d’Orsay that\nAugust evening, alone in the universe under that vast, faintly luminous,\nlate-twilight sky, Arden Wilmot came up the lawn. Neither Lorry nor\nEstelle saw or heard him until his voice, rough with drink and passion,\nsavagely stung them with, “What the hell does this mean?”",
        "Lorry dropped Estelle’s hand and stood up, Estelle behind him, a\nrestraining hand on his shoulder. Both were white to the lips; their sky,\nthe moment before so clear and still, was now black and thunderous with a\nfrightful storm. Estelle saw that her brother was far from sober; and the\nsight of his sister caressed by Lorry Tague would have maddened him even\nhad he not touched liquor. She darted between the two men. “Don’t be a\ngoose, Arden,” she panted, with a hysterical attempt to laugh.",
        "“That fellow was touching you!” stormed Arden. “You miserable disgrace!\"\nAnd he lifted his hand threateningly to her.",
        "Lorry put his arm round her and drew her back, himself advancing. “You\nmust be careful how you act toward the woman who is to be my wife, Mr.\nWilmot,” he said, afire in all his blood of the man who has the right to\ndemand of the whole world the justice he gives it.",
        "Arden Wilmot stared dumfounded, first at Lorry, then at Estelle. In the\npause, Adelaide, drawn from the library by the sound of Arden’s fury,\nreached the front doorway, saw the three, instantly knew the whole cause\nof this sudden, harsh commotion. With a twitch that was like the shaking\noff of a detaining grasp, with a roar like a mortally wounded beast’s,\nArden recovered the use of limbs and voice. “You infernal lump of dirt!\"\nhe yelled. Adelaide saw his arm swing backward, then forward, and up–saw\nsomething bright in his hand. A flash–\"O God, God!” she moaned. But she\ncould not turn her eyes away or close them.",
        "Lorry stood straight as a young sycamore for an instant, turned toward\nEstelle. “Good-by–my love!” he said softly, and fell, face downward,\nwith his hands clasping the edge of her dress.",
        "And Estelle–",
        "She made no sound. Like a ghost, she knelt and took Lorry’s head in her\nlap; with one hand against each of his cheeks she turned his head.\n“Lorry! Lorry!” she murmured in a heartbreaking voice that carried far\nthrough the stillness.",
        "Arden put the revolver back in his pocket, seized her by the\nshoulder. “Come away from that!” he ordered roughly, and half-lifted\nher to her feet.",
        "With a cry so awful that Adelaide swayed and almost swooned at hearing\nit, Estelle wrenched herself free, flung herself on her lover’s body,\nburied her fingers in his hair, covered his dead face with kisses, bathed\nher lips in the blood that welled from his heart. Shouts and heavy, quick\ntramping from many directions–the tempest of murder was drawing people\nto its center as a cyclone sucks in leaves. Fright in Arden Wilmot’s\nface, revealed to Adelaide in the light streaming from the big\ndrawing-room windows. A group–a crowd–a multitude–pouring upon the\nlawns from every direction–swirling round Arden as he stood over the\nprostrate intermingled forms of his sister and her dead lover.",
        "Then Adelaide, clinging to the door frame to steady herself, heard Arden\nsay in a loud blustering voice: “I found this fellow insulting my sister,\nand I treated him as a Wilmot always treats an insult.” And as the words\nreached her, they fired her. All her weakness, all her sense of\nhelplessness fled.",
        "Out of the circle came a man bearing unconscious Estelle, blood upon her\nface, upon her bosom, blood dripping from her hands. “Where shall I take\nher?” asked the man of Adelaide. “A doctor’s been sent for.”",
        "“Into the hall–on the sofa–at the end–and watch by her,” said Del, in\nquick, jerking tones. Her eyes were ablaze, her breath came in gusts.\nWithout waiting to see where he went with his burden, she rushed down the\nbroad steps and through the crowd, pushing them this way and that. She\nfaced Arden Wilmot–not a lady, but a woman, a flaming torch of outraged\nhuman feeling.",
        "“You lie!” she cried, and he seemed to wither before her. “You lie about\nhim and about her! You, with the very clothes you’re dressed in, the very\nliquor you’re drunk with, the very pistol that shot him down, paid for by\nher earnings! He never offended you–not by look or word. You murdered\nhim–I saw–heard. You murdered the man she was to marry, the man she\nloved–murdered him because she loved him. Look at him!”",
        "The crowd widened its circle before the sweep of her arm. Lorry’s\nblood-stained body came into view. His face, beautiful and, in its pale\ncalm, stronger than life, was open to the paling sky. “There lies a man,\"\nshe sobbed, and her tears were of the kind that make the fires of passion\nburn the fiercer. “A man any woman with a woman’s heart would have been\nproud to be loved by. And you–you’ve murdered him!”",
        "“Take care, Mrs. Hargrave,” a voice whispered in her ear. “They’ll\nlynch him.”",
        "“And why not?” she cried out. “Why should such a creature live?”",
        "A hundred men were reaching for Arden, and from the crowd rose that\nhoarse, low, hideous sound which is the first deep bay of the unleashed\nblood-madness. “No, no!” she begged in horror, and waved them back.",
        "“Adelaide!” gasped Arden, wrenching himself free and crouching at her\nfeet and clinging to her skirts. “Save me! I only did my duty as a\ngentleman.”",
        "She looked down at him in unpitying scorn, then out at the crowd. “Hear\nthat!” she cried, with a wild, terrible laugh. “A gentleman! Yes, that’s\ntrue–a gentleman. Saving your sister from the coarse contamination of an\nhonest man!” Then to the men who were dragging at him: “No, I say–no!\nLet him alone! Don’t touch the creature! He’ll only foul your hands.” And\nshe pushed them back. “Let him live. What worse fate could he have than\nto be pointed at every day of a long life as the worthless drunken thing\nwho murdered a man, and then tried to save himself by defaming his victim\nand his own sister?”",
        "Under cover of her barrier of command, the constable led Arden into the\nhouse, past where his sister lay in a swoon, and by the back way got him\nto jail. The crowd, fascinated by her beauty, which the tempest of\npassion had transfigured into terrible and compelling majesty, was\ncompletely under her control. She stayed on, facing that throng of men,\nmany of whom she knew by name, until Lorry’s body was taken away. She was\nabout to go into the house, as the crowd began quietly to disperse, when\nthere arose a murmur that made her turn quickly toward the doors. There\nwas Estelle, all disheveled and bloodstained. Her face was like death;\nher movements were like one walking in a deep sleep as she descended to\nthe lawn and came toward them.",
        "“Where is he? Where is he?” she wailed, pushing this way and that through\nthe crowd, her hands outstretched, her long fair hair streaming like a\nbridal veil. Her feet slipped on the wet grass–where it was wet with his\nblood. She staggered, swayed uncertainly, fell with her arms outstretched\nas if the earth were he she sought. She lay there moaning–the cry of her\ntortured nerves alone, for her mind was unconscious.",
        "Adelaide and Madelene, who had just come, bent to lift her. But their\nstrength failed them and they sank to their knees in terror; for, from\nthe silent crowd there burst a shriek: “Kill him, kill him!” And all in\nan instant the grounds were emptied of those thousands; and to the two\nwomen came an ever fainter but not less awful roar as the mob swept on\nuptown toward the jail.",
        "Madelene was first to recover. “Let us carry her in,” she said. And when\nthe limp form was once more on the big sofa and the eyelids were\ntrembling to unclose, she ripped open the right sleeve and thrust in the\nneedle that gives oblivion.",
        "Adelaide went to the window and listened. Before her in the moonlight was\nthe place where that tempest of hate and murder had burst and raged. Once\nmore her heart hardened in the pitiless fury of outraged mercy. A moan\nfrom Estelle stung her, and she leaned forward the better to catch the\nmusic of the mob’s distant shriek. Silence for full five minutes; then a\nsound like that which bursts from the throats of the bloodhounds as they\nbury their fangs in their quarry. She gave a faint scream, covered her\nface. “Oh, spare him! Spare him!” she cried. And she sank to the floor in\na faint, for she knew that Arden Wilmot was dead.",
        "Adelaide took Estelle’s store until Estelle came back to it, her surface\ncalm like the smooth river that hides in its tortured bosom the\ndeep-plunged rapids below the falls. The day after Estelle’s return\nAdelaide began to study architecture at the university; soon she was made\nan instructor, with the dean delighted and not a little mystified by her\nenergy and enthusiasm. Yet the matter was simple and natural: she had\nemerged from her baptism of blood and fire–a woman; at last she had\nlearned what in life is not worth while; she was ready to learn what it\nhas to offer that is worth while–the sole source of the joys that have\nno reaction, of the content that is founded upon the rock.",
