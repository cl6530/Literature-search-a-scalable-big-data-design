        "[George Henry Lewes, in his book on “Actors and the Art of Acting,\"\npublished by Henry Holt & Co., New York, 1878, says:",
        "“I must repeat the expression of my admiration for Ristori as a\ndistinguished actress; if not of the highest rank, she is very high,\nin virtue of her personal gifts, and the trained skill with which\nthese gifts are applied.  The question naturally arises, why is her\nsuccess so great in certain plays and so dubious in others?  It is of\nlittle use to say that Lady Macbeth and Adrienne Lecouvreur are beyond\nher powers; that is only restating the fact.  Can we not trace both\nsuccess and failure to one source?  In what is called the ideal\ndrama, constructed after the Greek type, she would be generally\nsuccessful, because the simplicity of its motives and the\nartificiality of its structure, removing it from beyond the region of\nordinary experience, demand from the actor a corresponding\nartificiality.  Attitudes, draperies, gestures, tones, and elocution\nwhich would be incongruous in a drama approaching more closely to the\nevolutions of ordinary experience, become, in the ideal drama,\nartistic modes of expression; and it is in these that Ristori displays\na fine selective instinct, and a rare felicity of organisation.”",
        "“Memoirs and Artistic Studies of Adelaide Ristori,” rendered into\nEnglish by G. Mantellini, with a biographical appendix by L. D.\nVentura, was published and copyrighted by Doubleday, Page & Co., New\nYork, 1907.  The chapters of that volume afford the pages which\nfollow.  The Artistic Studies comprise detailed histrionic\ninterpretations of the chief roles of Ristori:  Mary Stuart, Queen\nElizabeth, Lady Macbeth, Medea, Myrrha and Phedra.–ED.]",
        "WHEN twelve years old, I was booked with the famous actor and manager,\nGiuseppe Moncalvo, for the roles of a child.  Soon after, owing to my\nslender figure, they made me up as a little woman, giving me small\nparts as maid.  But they soon made up their minds that I was not\nfitted for such parts.  Having reached the age of thirteen and\ndeveloped in my figure, I was assigned several parts as second lady.\nIn those days they could not be too particular in small companies.  At\nthe age of fourteen, I had to recite the first part among the young\ngirls and that of the leading lady alternately, like an experienced\nactress.  It was about this time, in the city of Novara (Piedmont)\nthat I recited for the first time the “Francesca da Rimini” of Silvio\nPellico.  Though I was only fifteen my success was such that soon\nafterward they offered me the parts of leading lady with encouragement\nof advancement.",
        "My good father, who was gifted with a great deal of sense, did not\nallow his head to be turned by such offers.  Reflecting that my health\nmight suffer from being thrown so early into the difficulties of stage\nlife he refused these offers and accepted a more modest place, as\ningenue, in the Royal Company, under the auspices of the King of\nSardinia and stationed during several months of the year at Turin.  It\nwas managed by the leading man, the most intelligent and capable among\nthe stage managers of the time.  The advice of this cultured, though\nsevere man, rendered his management noteworthy and sought after as\nessential to the making of a good actor.",
        "Among the members of the company shone the foremost beacon-lights of\nItalian art, such as Vestri, Madame Marchionni, Romagnoli, Righetti,\nand many others who were quoted as examples of dramatic art, as well\nas Pasta, Malibran, Rubini, and Tamburini in the lyric art,",
        "My engagement for the part of ingenue was to have lasted three\nyears, but, after the year, I was promoted to the parts of the first\nlady, and in the third year, to the absolute leading lady.",
        "To such unhoped-for and flattering results I was able to attain, by\nascending step by step through the encouragement and admonition of my\nexcellent teacher, Madame Carlotta Marchionni, a distinguished\nactress, and the interest of Gaetano Bazzi who also had great\naffection for me.  It was really then that my artistic education\nbegan.  It was then that I acquired the knowledge and the rules which\nplaced me in a position to discern the characteristics of a true\nartist.  I learned to distinguish and to delineate the comic and the\ndramatic passions.  My temperament caused me to incline greatly toward\nthe tender and the gentle.",
        "However, in the tragic parts, my vigour increased.  I learned to\nportray transitions for the sake of fusing the different contrasts; a\ncapital but difficult study of detail, tedious at times, but of the\ngreatest importance.  The lamentations in a part where two extreme and\nopposing passions are at play, are like those which in painting are\ncalled “chiaro-oscuro,” a blending of the tones, which thus portrays\ntruth devoid of artifice.",
        "In order to succeed in this intent, it is necessary to take as model\nthe great culture of art, and also to be gifted with a well-tempered\nand artistic nature.  And these are not to be confined to sterile\nimitation, but are for the purpose of accumulating the rich material\nof dramatic erudition, so that one may present oneself before the\naudiences as an original and artistic individuality.",
        "Some people think that distinction of birth and a perfect education\nwill render them capable of appearing upon the stage with the same\nfacility and nonchalance with which one enters a ball-room, and they\nare not at all timid about walking upon the boards, presuming that\nthey can do it as well as an actor who has been raised upon them.  A\ngreat error!",
        "One of the greatest difficulties that they meet is in not knowing how\nto walk upon a stage, which, owing to the slight inclination in con\nstruction, easily causes the feet to totter, particularly if one is a\nbeginner, and especially at the entrances and exits.  I myself\nencountered this difficulty.  Though I had dedicated myself to the art\nfrom my infancy and had been instructed with the greatest care every\nday of my life by my grandmother, at the age of fifteen my movements\nhad not yet acquired all the ease and naturalness necessary to make me\nfeel at home upon the stage, and certain sudden turns always\nfrightened me.",
        "When I began my artistic apprenticeship, the use of diction was given\ngreat importance, as a means of judging an actor.  At that time the\naudience was critical and severe.",
        "In our days, the same audience has become less exacting, less\ncritical, and does not aim to improve the artist, by counting his\ndefects.  According to my opinion, the old system was best, as it is\nnot in excessive indulgence and solely by considering the good\nqualities, without correcting the bad ones, that real artists are\nmade.",
        "It is also my conviction that a person who wishes to dedicate himself\nto the stage should not begin his career with parts of great\nimportance, either comic, dramatic, or tragic.  The interpretation\nbecomes too difficult for a beginner and may harm his future career:\nfirst, the discouragement over the difficulties that he meets;\nsecondly, an excessive vanity caused by the appreciation with which\nthe public apparently honours him.  Both these sentiments will lead\nthe actor, in a short time, to neglect his study.  On the other hand,\nby taking several parts, he becomes familiar with the means of\nrendering his part natural, thus convincing himself that by\nrepresenting correctly characters of little importance, he will be\ngiven more important ones later on.  Thus it will come about that his\nstudy will be more careful.",
        "One of the greatest of the living examples of the school of realism is\nmy illustrious fellow artist, Signor Tommaso Salvini, with whom, for a\nnumber of years, I had the fortune to share the fatigues and the\nhonours of the profession which I also shared with Ernesto Rossi.  The\nformer was and is still admired.  His rare dramatic merits have\nnothing of the conventional, but owe their power to that spontaneity\nwhich is the most convincing revelation of art.  The wealth of\nplasticity which Salvini possesses, is in him, a natural gift.\nSalvini is the true exponent of the Italian dramatic art",
        "In the month of June, 1857, we began to rerehearse “Macbeth,” at\nCovent  Garden, London, It had been arranged for our company by Mr.\nClarke, and translated into most beautiful Italian verse by Giulio\nCarcano.  The renowned Mr. Harris put it on the stage according to\nEnglish traditions.  The representation of the part of Lady Macbeth,\nwhich afterward became one of my favourite roles, preoccupied me\ngreatly, as I knew only too well what kind of comparisons would be\nmade.  The remembrance of the marvellous creation of that character as\ngiven by the famous Mrs. Siddons and the traditional criticisms of the\npress, might have rendered the public very severe and difficult to\nplease.",
        "I used all my ability of interpretation to reveal and transmit the\nmost minute intentions of the author.  To the English audience it\nseemed that I had really incarnated that perfidious but great\ncharacter of Lady Macbeth, in a way that surpassed all expectations.",
        "We had to repeat the drama for several evenings, always producing a\nmost profound impression upon the minds of the audience, particularly\nin the grand sleep-walking scene.  So thoroughly had I entered into\nthe nature of Lady Macbeth, that during the entire scene my pupils\nwere motionless in their orbit, causing me to shed tears.  To this\nenforced immobility of the eye I owe the weakening of my eyesight.\nFrom the analytical study which I shall give of this diabolical\ncharacter [at the close of her Memoirs] the reader can form for\nhimself an idea of how much its interpretation cost me (particularly\nin the final culminating scene), in my endeavour to get the right\nintonation of the voice and the true expression of the physiognomy.",
        "My exceptionally good health never abandoned me through my long and\ntiresome journeys, though unfortunately I never was able to accustom\nmyself to voyaging by sea.  All through those rapid changes I acquired\na marvellous store of endurance.  That sort of life infused in me\nsufficient energy to lead me through every kind of hardship with the\nresolution and authority of a commanding general.  All obeyed me.\nNone questioned my authority owing to my absolute impartiality, being\nalways ready, as I was, either to blame or correct him who did not\nfulfil his obligations, also to praise without any distinction of\nclass those who deserved it.  I almost always met with courtesy among\nthe actors under my direction, and if any one of them dared to trouble\nour harmony, he was instantly put to his proper place by the firmness\nof my discipline.",
        "The artistic management of the plays was left to me in all its\ndetails.  Every order and every disposition came from me directly.  I\nlooked after all matters large and small, the things that every actor\nunderstands contribute to making the success of a play.",
        "Concerning my own personal interests, they were in charge of a private\nmanager.",
        "I am proud to say that my husband was the soul of all my undertakings.\nAs I speak of him, my heart impels me to say that he ever exercised\nupon me and my professional career the kindest and most benevolent\ninfluence.  It was he who upheld my courage, whenever I hesitated\nbefore some difficulty; it was he who foretold the glory I should\nacquire, he who pointed out to me the goal, and anticipated everything\nin order that I should secure it.  Without his assistance I never\nshould have been able to put into effect the daring attempt of\ncarrying the flag of Italian dramatic art all over the globe.",
        "During the month of September, 1866, for the first time in my life, I\ncrossed the ocean on my way to the United States, where I remained\nuntil May 17th of the following year.  It was in the elegant Lyceum\nTheatre of New York that I made my debut, on the 20th of September,\nwith “Medea.”  I could not anticipate a more enthusiastic reception\nthan the one I was honoured with.  I felt anxious to make myself known\nin that new part of the world, and let the Americans hear me recite\nfor the first time, in the soft and melodic Italian language.  I knew\nthat in spite of the prevailing characteristics of the inhabitants of\nthe free country of George Washington, always busy as they are in\ntheir feverish pursuit of wealth, that the love for the beautiful and\nadmiration for dramatic art were not neglected.  During my first\nseason in New York I met with an increasing success, and formed such\nfriendly relations with many distinguished and cultured people that\ntime and distance have never caused me to forget them.  While writing\nthese lines I send an affectionate salutation to all those who in\nAmerica still honour me with their remembrance.",
        "I made my fourth trip to London in 1873.  Not having any new drama to\npresent and being tired of repeating the same productions, I felt the\nnecessity of reanimating my mind with some strong emotion, of\ndiscovering something, in a word, the execution of which had never\nbeen attempted by others.",
        "At last I believed I had found something to satisfy my desire.  The\nadmiration I had for the Shakespearean dramas, and particularly for\nthe character of Lady Macbeth, inspired me with the idea of playing in\nEnglish the sleeping scene from “Macbeth,” which I think is the\ngreatest conception of the Titanic poet.  I was also induced to make\nthis bold attempt, partly as a tribute of gratitude to the English\naudiences of the great metropolis, who had shown me so much deference.\nBut how was I going to succeed?  ...  I took advice from a good friend\nof mine, Mrs. Ward, the mother of the renowned actress Genevieve Ward.\nShe not only encouraged my idea, but offered her services in helping\nme to learn how to recite that scene in English.",
        "I still had some remembrance of my study of English when I was a girl,\nand there is no language more difficult to pronounce and enunciate\ncorrectly, for an Italian.  I was frightened only to think of that,\nstill I drew sufficient courage even from its difficulties to grapple\nwith my task.  After a fortnight of constant study, I found myself\nready to make an attempt at my recitation.  However, not wishing to\ncompromise my reputation by risking a failure, I acted very\ncautiously.",
        "I invited to my house the most competent among the dramatic critics of\nthe London papers, without forewarning them of the object and asked\nthem kindly to hear me and express frankly their opinion, assuring\nthem that if it should not be a favourable one, I would not feel badly\nover it.",
        "I then recited the scene in English, and my judges seemed to be very\nmuch pleased.  They corrected my pronunciation of two words only, and\nencouraged me to announce publicly my bold project.  The evening of\nthe performance, at the approach of that important scene, I was\ntrembling!  ...  The enthusiastic reception granted me by the audience\nawakened in me all vigour, and the happy success of my effort\ncompensated me a thousandfold for all the anxieties I had gone\nthrough.  This success still increased my ambitious aspirations, and I\nwished to try myself in even a greater task.",
        "I aimed at no less a project than the impersonation of the entire role\nof Lady Macbeth in English, but such an arduous undertaking seemed so\nbold to me that I finally gave up the idea and drove away from my mind\nforever the temptation to try it.",
