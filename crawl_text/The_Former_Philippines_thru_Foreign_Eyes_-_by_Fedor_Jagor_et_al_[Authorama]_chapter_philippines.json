        "Among the many wrongs done the Filipinos by Spaniards, to be charged\nagainst their undeniably large debt to Spain, one of the greatest,\nif not the most frequently mentioned, was taking from them their\ngood name.",
        "Spanish writers have never been noted for modesty or historical\naccuracy. Back in 1589 the printer of the English translation of Padre\nJuan Gonzalez de Mendoza’s “History of the Great and Mighty Kingdom of\nChina” felt it necessary to prefix this warning: * * * the Spaniards\n(following their ambitious affections) do usually in all their writings\nextoll their own actions, even to the setting forth of many untruthes\nand incredible things, as in their descriptions of the conquistes of\nthe east and west Indies, etc., doth more at large appeare.",
        "Of early Spanish historians Doctor Antonio de Morga seems the single\nexception, and perhaps even some of his credit comes by contrast,\nbut in later years the rule apparently has proved invariable. As\nthe conditions in the successive periods of Spanish influence were\nrecognized to be indicative of little progress, if not actually\nretrogressive, the practice grew up of correspondingly lowering the\ncurrent estimates of the capacity of the Filipinos of the conquest, so\nthat always an apparent advance appeared. This in the closing period,\nin order to fabricate a sufficient showing for over three centuries\nof pretended progress, led to the practical denial of human attributes\nto the Filipinos found here by Legaspi.",
        "Against this denial to his countrymen of virtues as well as\nrights, Doctor Rizal opposed two briefs whose English titles\nare “The Philippines A Century Hence” and “The Indolence of the\nFilipino.” Almost every page therein shows the influence of the young\nstudent’s early reading of the hereinafter-printed studies by the\nGerman scientist Jagor, friend and counsellor in his maturer years,\nand the liberal Spaniard Comyn. Even his acquaintance with Morga,\nwhich eventually led to Rizal’s republication of the 1609 history\nlong lost to Spaniards, probably was owing to Jagor, although the\nlife-long resolution for that action can be traced to hearing of Sir\nJohn Bowring’s visit to his uncle’s home and the proposed Hakluyt\nSociety English translation then mentioned.",
        "The present value and interest of these now rare books has suggested\ntheir republication, to make available to Filipino students a course\nof study which their national hero found profitable as well as to\ncorrect the myriad misconceptions of things Philippine in the minds\nof those who have taken the accepted Spanish accounts as gospel truths.",
        "Dr. L. V. Schweibs, of Berlin, made the hundreds of corrections,\nmany reversing the meanings of former readings, which almost\njustify calling the revised Jagor translation a new one. Numerous\nhitherto-untranslated passages likewise appear. There have been\nleft out the illustrations, from crude drawings obsolete since\nphotographic pictures have familiarized the scenes and objects,\nand also the consequently superfluous references to these. No other\nomission has been allowed, for if one author leaned far to one side in\ncertain debatable questions the other has been equally partisan for the\nopposite side, except a cerement on religion in general and discussion\nof the world-wide social evil were eliminated as having no particular\nPhilippine bearing to excuse their appearance in a popular work.",
        "The early American quotations of course are for comparison with the\nnumerous American comments of today, and the two magazine extracts\ngive English accounts a century apart. Virchow’s matured views have\nbeen substituted for the pioneer opinions he furnished Professor Jagor\nthirty years earlier, and if Rizal’s patron in the scientific world\nfails at times in his facts his method for research is a safe guide.",
        "Finally, three points should constantly be borne in mind: (1) allowance\nmust be made for the lessening Spanish influence, surely more foreign\nto this seafaring people than the present modified Anglo-Saxon\neducation, and so more artificial, i.e., less assimilable, as well\nas for the removal of the unfavorable environment, before attempting\nto from an opinion of the present-day Filipino from his prototype\npictured in those pages; (2) foreign observers are apt to emphasize\nwhat is strange to them in describing other lands than their own and to\nleave unnoted points of resemblance which may be much more numerous;\n(3) Rizal’s judgment that his countrymen were more like backward\nEuropeans than Orientals was based on scientific studies of Europe’s\nrural districts and Philippine provincial conditions as well as of\noriental country life, so that it is entitled to more weight than\nthe commoner opinion to the contrary which though more popular has\nbeen less carefully formed.",

        "Manila, March 11th, 1916.",
        "[Difference from European time.] When the clock strikes twelve in\nMadrid, [1] it is 8 hours, 18 minutes, and 41 seconds past eight\nin the evening at Manila; that is to say, the latter city lies 124°\n40’ 15’’ to the east of the former (7 hours, 54 minutes, 35 seconds\nfrom Paris). Some time ago, however, while the new year was being\ncelebrated in Madrid, it was only New Year’s eve at Manila.",
        "[Magellan’s mistake in reckoning.] As Magellan, who discovered the\nPhilippines in his memorable first circumnavigation of the globe,\nwas following the sun in its apparent daily path around the world,\nevery successive degree he compassed on his eastern course added\nfour minutes to the length of his day; and, when he reached the\nPhilippines, the difference amounted to sixteen hours. This, however,\napparently escaped his notice, for Elcano, the captain of the only\nremaining vessel, was quite unaware, on his return to the longitude\nof his departure, why according to his ship’s log-book, he was a day\nbehind the time of the port which he had reached again by continuously\nsailing westward. [2] [3]",
        "[Change to the Asian day.] The error remained also unheeded in the\nPhilippines. It was still, over there the last day of the old year,\nwhile the rest of the world was commencing the new one; and this state\nof things continued till the close of 1844, when it was resolved,\nwith the approval of the archbishop, to pass over New Year’s eve for\nonce altogether. [4] Since that time the Philippines are considered\nto lie no longer in the distant west, but in the far east, and are\nabout eight hours in advance of their mother country. The proper field\nfor their commerce, however, is what is to Europeans the far west;\nthey were colonized thence, and for centuries, till 1811, they had\nalmost no other communication with Europe but the indirect one by\nthe annual voyage of the galleon between Manila and Acapulco. Now,\nhowever, when the eastern shores of the Pacific are at last beginning\nto teem with life, and, with unexampled speed, are pressing forward to\ngrasp their stupendous future, the Philippines will no longer be able\nto remain in their past seclusion. No tropical Asiatic colony is so\nfavorably situated for communication with the west coast of America,\nand it is only in a few matters that the Dutch Indies can compete with\nthem for the favors of the Australian market. But, [Future in American\nand Australian trade.] on the other hand, they will have to abandon\ntheir traffic with China, whose principal emporium Manila originally\nwas, as well as that with those westward-looking countries of Asia,\nEurope’s far east, which lie nearest to the Atlantic ports.  [5] [6]",
        "[Commercially in the New World.] When the circumstances mentioned\ncome to be realized, the Philippines, or, at any rate, the principal\nmarket for their commerce, will finally fall within the limits of\nthe western hemisphere, to which indeed they were relegated by the\nillustrious Spanish geographers at Badajoz.",
        "[The Pope’s world-partitive.] The Bull issued by Alexander VI, [7]\non May 4, 1493, which divided the earth into two hemispheres, decreed\nthat all heathen lands discovered in the eastern half should belong\nto the Portuguese; in the western half to the Spaniards. According to\nthis arrangement, the latter could only claim the Philippines under\nthe pretext that they were situated in the western hemisphere. The\ndemarcation line was to run from the north to the south, a hundred\nleagues to the south-west of all the so-called Azores and Cape\nde Verde Islands. In accordance with the treaty of Tordesillas,\nnegotiated between Spain and Portugal on June 7, 1494, and approved\nby Julius II, in 1506, this line was drawn three hundred and seventy\nleagues west of the Cape de Verde Islands.",
        "[Faulty Spanish and Portuguese geography.] At that time Spanish and\nPortuguese geographers reckoned seventeen and one-half leagues to a\ndegree on the equator. In the latitude of the Cape de Verde Islands,\nthree hundred and seventy leagues made 21° 55’. If to this we add\nthe longitudinal difference between the westernmost point of the\ngroup and Cadiz, a difference of 18° 48’, we get 40° 43’ west, and\n139° 17’ east from Cadiz (in round numbers 47° west and 133° east),\nas the limits of the Spanish hemisphere. At that time, however,\nthe existing means for such calculations were entirely insufficient.",
        "[Extravagant Spanish claims thru ignorance.] The latitude was measured\nwith imperfect astrolabes, or wooden quadrants, and calculated from\nvery deficient tables; the variation of the compass, moreover, was\nalmost unknown, as well as the use of the log. [8] Both method and\ninstruments were wanting for useful longitudinal calculations. It was\nunder these circumstances that the Spaniards attempted, at Badajoz,\nto prove to the protesting Portuguese that the eastern boundary line\nintersected the mouths of the Ganges, and proceeded to lay claim to\nthe possession of the Spice Islands.",
        "[Spain’s error in calculation.] The eastern boundary should, in\nreality, have been drawn 46 1/2° further to the east, that is to\nsay, as much further as it is from Berlin to the coast of Labrador,\nor to the lesser Altai; for, in the latitude of Calcutta 46 1/2°\nare equivalent to two thousand five hundred and seventy-five nautical\nmiles. Albo’s log-book gives the difference in longitude between the\nmost eastern islands of the Archipelago and Cape Fermoso (Magellan’s\nStraits), as 106° 30’, while in reality it amounts to 159° 85’.",
        "[Moluccan rights sold to Portugal.] The disputes between the Spaniards\nand the Portuguese, occasioned by the uncertainty of the eastern\nboundary–Portugal had already founded a settlement in the Spice\nIslands–were set at rest by an agreement made in 1529, in which\nCharles V. abandoned his pretended rights to the Moluccas in favor\nof Portugal, for the sum of 350,000 ducats. The Philippines, at that\ntime, were of no value.",
        "[Foreign mail facilities.] The distance from Manila to Hongkong is\nsix hundred fifty nautical miles, and the course is almost exactly\nsouth-east. The mail steamer running between the two ports makes the\ntrip in from three to four days. This allows of a fortnightly postal\ncommunication between the colony and the rest of the world. [9]",
        "[Slight share in world commerce.] This small steamer is the only thing\nto remind an observer at Hongkong, a port thronged with the ships of\nall nations, that an island so specially favored in conditions and\nfertility lies in such close proximity.",
        "[Little commerce with Spain.] Although the Philippines belong to Spain,\nthere is but little commerce between the two countries. Once the\ntie which bound them was so close that Manila was wont to celebrate\nthe arrival of the Spanish mail with Te Deums and bell-ringing, in\nhonor of the successful achievement of so stupendous a journey. Until\nPortugal fell to Spain, the road round Africa to the Philippines was\nnot open to Spanish vessels. The condition of the overland route\nis sufficiently shown by the fact that two Augustinian monks who,\nin 1603, were entrusted with an important message for the king,\nand who chose the direct line through Goa, Turkey, and Italy, needed\nthree years for reaching Madrid. [10]",
        "[Former Spanish ships mainly carried foreign goods.] The trade by\nSpanish ships, which the merchants were compelled to patronize in\norder to avoid paying an additional customs tax, in spite of the\nprotective duties for Spanish products, was almost exclusively\nin foreign goods to the colony and returning the products of the\nlatter for foreign ports. The traffic with Spain was limited to the\nconveyance of officials, priests, and their usual necessaries, such as\nprovisions, wine and other liquors; and, except a few French novels,\nsome atrociously dull books, histories of saints, and similar works.",
        "[Manila’s fine bay.] The Bay of Manila is large enough to contain the\nunited fleets of Europe; it has the reputation of being one of the\nfinest in the world. The aspect of the coast, however, to a stranger\narriving, as did the author, at the close of the dry season, falls\nshort of the lively descriptions of some travellers. The circular bay,\none hundred twenty nautical miles in circumference, the waters of\nwhich wash the shores of five different provinces, is fringed in the\nneighborhood of Manila by a level coast, behind which rises an equally\nflat table land. The scanty vegetation in the foreground, consisting\nchiefly of bamboos and areca palms, was dried up by the sun; while in\nthe far distance the dull uniformity of the landscape was broken by\nthe blue hills of San Mateo. In the rainy season the numerous unwalled\ncanals overflow their banks and form a series of connected lakes,\nwhich soon, however, change into luxuriant and verdant ricefields.",
        "[City’s appearance mediaeval European.] Manila is situated on both\nsides of the river Pasig. The town itself, surrounded with walls and\nramparts, with its low tiled roofs and a few towers, had, in 1859,\nthe appearance of some ancient European fortress. Four years later\nthe greater part of it was destroyed by an earthquake.",
        "[The 1863 earthquake.] On June 3, 1863, at thirty-one minutes past\nseven in the evening, after a day of tremendous heat while all Manila\nwas busy in its preparations for the festival of Corpus Christi,\nthe ground suddenly rocked to and fro with great violence. The\nfirmest buildings reeled visibly, walls crumbled, and beams snapped\nin two. The dreadful shock lasted half a minute; but this little\ninterval was enough to change the whole town into a mass of ruins,\nand to bury alive hundreds of its inhabitants. [11] A letter of\nthe governor-general, which I have seen, states that the cathedral,\nthe government-house, the barracks, and all the public buildings of\nManila were entirely destroyed, and that the few private houses which\nremained standing threatened to fall in. Later accounts speak of\nfour hundred killed and two thousand injured, and estimate the loss\nat eight millions of dollars. Forty-six public and five hundred and\nseventy private buildings were thrown down; twenty-eight public and\nfive hundred twenty-eight private buildings were nearly destroyed,\nand all the houses left standing were more or less injured.",
        "[Damage in Cavite.] At the same time, an earthquake of forty seconds’\nduration occurred at Cavite, the naval port of the Philippines,\nand destroyed many buildings.",
        "[Destruction in walled city.] Three years afterwards, the Duc\nd’Alencon (Lucon et Mindanao; Paris, 1870, S. 38) found the traces\nof the catastrophe everywhere. Three sides of the principal square\nof the city, in which formerly stood the government, or governor’s,\npalace, the cathedral, and the townhouse, were lying like dust heaps\novergrown with weeds. All the large public edifices were “temporarily\"\nconstructed of wood; but nobody then seemed to plan anything permanent.",
        "[Former heavy shocks.] Manila is very often subject to earthquakes;\nthe most fatal occurred in 1601; in 1610 (Nov. 30); in 1645 (Nov. 30);\nin 1658 (Aug. 20); in 1675; in 1699; in 1796; in 1824; in 1852; and\nin 1863. In 1645, six hundred [12], or, according to some accounts,\nthree thousand [13] persons perished, buried under the ruins of their\nhouses. Their monastery, the church of the Augustinians, and that of\nthe Jesuits, were the only public buildings which remained standing.",
        "[Frequent minor disturbances.] Smaller shocks, which suddenly set\nthe hanging lamps swinging, occur very often and generally remain\nunnoticed. The houses are on this account generally of but one story,\nand the loose volcanic soil on which they are built may lessen the\nviolence of the shock. Their heavy tiled roofs, however, appear\nvery inappropriate under such circumstances. Earthquakes are also\nof frequent occurrence in the provinces, but they, as a rule, cause\nso little damage, owing to the houses being constructed of timber or\nbamboo, that they are never mentioned.",
        "[Scanty data available.] M. Alexis Perrey (Mém. de l’Académie de\nDijon, 1860) has published a list, collected with much diligence from\nevery accessible source, of the earthquakes which have visited the\nPhilippines, and particularly Manila. But the accounts, even of the\nmost important, are very scanty, and the dates of their occurrence very\nunreliable. Of the minor shocks, only a few are mentioned, those which\nwere noticed by scientific observers accidentally present at the time.",
        "[The 1610 catastrophe.] Aduarte (I. 141) mentions a tremendous\nearthquake which occurred in 1610. I briefly quote his version of\nthe details of the catastrophe, as I find them mentioned nowhere else.",
        "“Towards the close of November, 1610, on St. Andrew’s Day, a more\nviolent earthquake than had ever before been witnessed, visited\nthese Islands; its effects extended from Manila to the extreme end\nof the province of Nueva Segovia (the whole northern part of Luzon),\na distance of 200 leagues. It caused great destruction over the entire\narea; in the province of Ilocos it buried palm trees, so that only the\ntops of their branches were left above the earth’s surface; through\nthe power of the earthquake mountains were pushed against each other;\nit threw down many buildings, and killed a great number of people. Its\nfury was greatest in Nueva Segovia, where it opened the mountains, and\ncreated new lake basins. The earth threw up immense fountains of sand,\nand vibrated so terribly that the people, unable to stand upon it,\nlaid down and fastened themselves to the ground, as if they had been\non a ship in a stormy sea. In the range inhabited by the Mendayas a\nmountain fell in, crushing a village and killing its inhabitants. An\nimmense portion of the cliff sank into the river; and now, where the\nstream was formerly bordered by a range of hills of considerable\naltitude, its banks are nearly level with the watercourse. The\ncommotion was so great in the bed of the river that waves arose like\nthose of the ocean, or as if the water had been lashed by a furious\nwind. Those edifices which were of stone suffered the most damage,\nour church and the convent fell in, etc., etc.”",
        "[Customhouse red tape.] The customs inspection, and the many\nformalities which the native minor officials exercised without any\nconsideration appear all the more wearisome to the new arrival when\ncontrasted with the easy routine of the English free ports of the\neast he has just quitted. The guarantee of a respectable merchant\nobtained for me, as a particular favor, permission to disembark after\na detention of sixteen hours; but even then I was not allowed to take\nthe smallest article of luggage on shore with me.",
        "[Shelter for shipping.] During the south-west monsoon and the stormy\nseason that accompanies the change of monsoons, the roadstead is\nunsafe. Larger vessels are then obliged to seek protection in the\nport of Cavite, seven miles further down the coast; but during the\nnorth-east monsoons they can safely anchor half a league from the\ncoast. All ships under three hundred tons burden pass the breakwater\nand enter the Pasig, where, as far as the bridge, they lie in serried\nrows, extending from the shore to the middle of the stream, and bear\nwitness by their numbers, as well as by the bustle and stir going on\namongst them, to the activity of the home trade.",
        "[Silting up of river mouth.] In every rain-monsoon, the Pasig river\nsweeps such a quantity of sediment against the breakwater that just\nits removal keeps, as it seems, the dredging machine stationed there\nentirely occupied.",
        "[Few foreign vessels.] The small number of the vessels in the\nroadstead, particularly of those of foreign countries, was the more\nremarkable as Manila was the only port in the Archipelago that had any\ncommerce with foreign countries. It is true that since 1855 three other\nports, to which a fourth may now be added, had gotten this privilege;\nbut at the time of my arrival, in March, 1859, not one of them had\never been entered by a foreign vessel, and it was a few weeks after\nmy visit that the first English ship sailed into Iloilo to take in\na cargo of sugar for Australia. [14]",
        "[Antiquated restrictions on trade.] The reason of this peculiarity\nlaid partly in the feeble development of agriculture, in spite of the\nunexampled fertility of the soil, but chiefly in the antiquated and\nartificially limited conditions of trade. The customs duties were\nin themselves not very high. They were generally about seven per\ncent. upon merchandise conveyed under the Spanish flag, and about\ntwice as much for that carried in foreign bottoms. When the cargo\nwas of Spanish production, the duty was three per cent. if carried\nin national vessels, eight per cent. if in foreign ships. The latter\nwere only allowed, as a rule, to enter the port in ballast. [15]",
        "[Discouragements for foreign ships.] As, however, the principal wants\nof the colony were imported from England and abroad, these were either\nkept back till an opportunity occurred of sending them in Spanish\nvessels, which charged nearly a treble freight (from £4 to £5 instead\nof from £1 1/2, to £2 per ton), and which only made their appearance\nin British ports at rare intervals, or they were sent to Singapore and\nHongkong, where they were transferred to Spanish ships. Tonnage dues\nwere levied, moreover, upon ships in ballast, and upon others which\nmerely touched at Manila without unloading or taking in fresh cargo;\nand, if a vessel under such circumstances landed even the smallest\nparcel, it was no longer rated as a ship in ballast, but charged on the\nhigher scale. Vessels were therefore forced to enter the port entirely\ndevoid of cargo, or carrying sufficient to cover the expense of the\nincreased harbor dues; almost an impossibility for foreign ships,\non account of the differential customs rates, which acted almost as a\ncomplete prohibition. The result was that foreign vessels came there\nonly in ballast, or when summoned for some particular object.",
        "[Export taxes.] The exports of the colony were almost entirely\nlimited to its raw produce, which was burdened with an export duty\nof three per cent. Exports leaving under the Spanish flag were only\ntaxed to the amount of one per cent.; but, as scarcely any export\ntrade existed with Spain, and as Spanish vessels, from their high\nrates of freight, were excluded from the carrying trade of the world,\nthe boon to commerce was a delusive one.  [16]",
        "[Laws drove away trade.] These inept excise laws, hampered with a\nhundred suspicious forms, frightened away the whole carrying trade\nfrom the port; and its commission merchants were frequently unable\nto dispose of the local produce. So trifling was the carrying trade\nthat the total yearly average of the harbor dues, calculated from\nthe returns of ten years, barely reached $10,000.",
        "[Manila’s favorable location.] The position of Manila, a central\npoint betwixt Japan, China, Annam, the English and Dutch ports of\nthe Archipelago and Australia, is in itself extremely favorable\nto the development of a world-wide trade. [17] At the time of the\nnorth-eastern monsoons, during our winter, when vessels for the sake of\nshelter pass through the Straits of Gilolo on their way from the Indian\nArchipelago to China, they are obliged to pass close to Manila. They\nwould find it a most convenient station, for the Philippines, as we\nhave already mentioned, are particularly favorably placed for the\nwest coast of America.",
        "[The 1869 reform.] A proof that the Spanish Ultramar minister fully\nrecognizes and appreciates these circumstances appears in his decree,\nof April 5, 1869, which is of the highest importance for the future\nof the colony. It probably would have been issued earlier had not the\nSpanish and colonial shipowners, pampered by the protective system,\nobstinately struggled against an innovation which impaired their\nformer privileges and forced them to greater activity.",
        "[Bettered conditions.] The most noteworthy points of the decree are\nthe moderation of the differential duties, and their entire extinction\nat the expiration of two years; the abrogation of all export duties;\nand the consolidation of the more annoying port dues into one single\ncharge.",
        "[Pre-Spanish foreign commerce.] When the Spaniards landed in the\nPhilippines they found the inhabitants clad in silks and cotton stuffs,\nwhich were imported by Chinese ships to exchange for gold-dust,\nsapan wood, [18] holothurian, edible birds’ nests, and skins. The\nIslands were also in communication with Japan, Cambodia, Siam, [19]\nthe Moluccas, and the Malay Archipelago. De Barros mentions that\nvessels from Luzon visited Malacca in 1511. [20]",
        "[Early extension under Spain.] The greater order which reigned in\nthe Philippines after the advent of the Spaniards, and still more the\ncommerce they opened with America and indirectly with Europe, had the\neffect of greatly increasing the Island trade, and of extending it\nbeyond the Indies to the Persian Gulf. Manila was the great mart for\nthe products of Eastern Asia, with which it loaded the galleons that,\nas early as 1565, sailed to and from New Spain (at first to Navidad,\nafter 1602 to Acapulco), and brought back silver as their principal\nreturn freight. [21]",
        "[Jealousy of Seville monopolists.] The merchants in New Spain and Peru\nfound this commerce so advantageous, that the result was very damaging\nto the exports from the mother country, whose manufactured goods were\nunable to compete with the Indian cottons and the Chinese silks. The\nspoilt monopolists of Seville demanded therefore the abandonment of a\ncolony which required considerable yearly contributions from the home\nexchequer, which stood in the way of the mother country’s exploiting\nher American colonies, and which let the silver of His Majesty’s\ndominions pass into the hands of the heathen. Since the foundation of\nthe colony they had continually thrown impediments in its path. [22]\nTheir demands, however, were vain in face of the ambition of the\nthrone and the influence of the clergy; rather, responding to the\nviews of that time the merchants of Peru and New Spain were forced,\nin the interests of the mother country, to obtain merchandise from\nChina, either directly, or through Manila. The inhabitants of the\nPhilippines were alone permitted to send Chinese goods to America,\nbut only to the yearly value of $250,000. The return trade was limited\nto $500,000. [23]",
        "[Prohibition of China trading.] The first amount was afterwards\nincreased to $300,000, with a proportionate augmentation of the\nreturn freight; but the Spanish were forbidden to visit China, so\nthat they were obliged to await the arrival of the junks. Finally,\nin 1720, Chinese goods were strictly prohibited throughout the\nwhole of the Spanish possessions in both hemispheres. A decree of\n1734 (amplified in 1769) once more permitted trade with China, and\nincreased the maximum value of the annual freightage to Acapulco to\n$500,000 (silver) and that of the return trade to twice the amount.",
        "[Higher limit on suspension of galleon voyages.] After the galleons to\nAcapulco, which had been maintained at the expense of the government\ntreasury, had stopped their voyages, commerce with America was\nhandled by merchants who were permitted in 1820, to export goods\nup to $750,000 annually from the Philippines and to visit San Blas,\nGuayaquil and Callao, besides Acapulco.",
        "[ British occupation inspired new wants.] This concession, however,\nwas not sufficient to compensate Philippine commerce for the injuries\nit suffered through the separation of Mexico from Spain. The possession\nof Manila by the English, in 1762, made its inhabitants acquainted with\nmany industrial products which the imports from China and India were\nunable to offer them. To satisfy these new cravings Spanish men-of-war\nwere sent, towards the close of 1764, to the colony with products of\nSpanish industries, such as wine, provisions, hats, cloth, hardware,\nand fancy articles.",
        "[Manila oppositions to trade innovations.] The Manila merchants,\naccustomed to a lucrative trade with Acapulco, strenuously resisted\nthis innovation, although it was a considerable source of profit to\nthem, for the Crown purchased the Indian and Chinese merchandise for\nits return freights from Manila at double their original value. In\n1784, however, the last of these ships arrived.",
        "[Subterfuges of European traders.] After the English invasion,\nEuropean vessels were strictly forbidden to visit Manila; but as\nthat city did not want to do without Indian merchandise, and could\nnot import it in its own ships, it was brought there in English and\nFrench bottoms, which assumed a Turkish name, and were provided with\nan Indian sham-captain.",
        "[The “Philippine Company” monopoly.] In 1785, the Compañía de Filipinas\nobtained a monopoly of the trade between Spain and the colony, but it\nwas not allowed to interfere with the direct traffic between Acapulco\nand Manila. The desire was to acquire large quantities of colonial\nproduce, silk, indigo, cinnamon, cotton, pepper, etc., in order to\nexport it somewhat as was done later on by the system of culture in\nJava; but as it was unable to obtain compulsory labor, it entirely\nfailed in its attempted artificial development of agriculture.",
        "[Losses by bad management.] The Compañía suffered great losses through\nits erroneous system of operation, and the incapacity of its officials\n(it paid, for example, $13.50 for a picul of pepper which cost from\nthree to four dollars in Sumatra).",
        "[Entrance of foriegn ships and firms.] In 1789 foreign ships were\nallowed to import Chinese and Indian produce, but none from Europe. In\n1809 an English commercial house obtained permission to establish\nitself in Manila. [24] In 1814, after the conclusion of the peace\nwith France, the same permission, with greater or less restrictions,\nwas granted to all foreigners.",
        "[Trade free but port charges discriminating.]  In 1820 the direct\ntrade between the Philippines and Spain was thrown open without any\nlimitations to the exports of colonial produce, on the condition\nthat the value of the Indian and Chinese goods in each expedition\nshould not exceed $50,000. Ever since 1834, when the privileges\nof the Compañía expired, free trade has been permitted in Manila;\nforeign ships, however, being charged double dues. Four new ports\nhave been thrown open to general trade since 1855; and in 1869 the\nliberal tariff previously alluded to was issued.",
        "[Port’s importance lessened under Spain.]  Today, after three centuries\nof almost undisturbed Spanish rule, Manila has by no means added to the\nimportance it possessed shortly after the advent of the Spaniards. The\nisolation of Japan and the Indo-Chinese empires, a direct consequence\nof the importunities and pretensions of the Catholic missionaries, [25]\nthe secession of the colonies on the west coast of America, above all\nthe long continuance of a distrustful commercial and colonial policy–a\npolicy which exists even at the present day–while important markets,\nbased on large capital and liberal principles, were being established\nin the most favored spots of the British and Dutch Indies; all these\ncircumstances have contributed to this result and thrown the Chinese\ntrade into other channels. The cause is as clear as the effect,\nyet it might be erroneous to ascribe the policy so long pursued to\nshort-sightedness. The Spaniards, in their schemes of colonisation,\nhad partly a religious purpose in view, but the government discovered\na great source of influence in the disposal of the extremely lucrative\ncolonial appointments. The crown itself, as well as its favorites,\nthought of nothing but extracting the most it could from the colony,\nand had neither the intention or the power to develop the natural\nwealth of the country by agriculture and commerce. Inseparable from\nthis policy, was the persistent exclusion of foreigners. [26] It seemed\neven more necessary in the isolated Philippines than in America to cut\noff the natives from all contact with foreigners, if the Spaniards had\nany desire to remain in undisturbed possession of the colony. In face,\nhowever, of the developed trade of today and the claims of the world\nto the productive powers of such an extraordinarily fruitful soil, the\nold restrictions can no longer be maintained, and the lately-introduced\nliberal tariff must be hailed as a thoroughly well-timed measure.",
        "[Galleon story sidelight on colonial history.]  The oft-mentioned\nvoyages of the galleons betwixt Manila and Acapulco hold such a\nprominent position in the history of the Philippines, and afford\nsuch an interesting glimpse into the old colonial system, that their\nprincipal characteristics deserve some description.",
        "[Chinese part in galleon trade.]  In the days of Morga, towards the\nclose of the sixteenth century, from thirty to forty Chinese junks\nwere in the habit of annually visiting Manila (generally in March);\ntowards the end of June a galleon used to sail for Acapulco. The trade\nwith the latter place, the active operations of which were limited to\nthe three central months of the year, was so lucrative, easy, and safe,\nthat the Spaniards scarcely cared to engage in any other undertakings.",
        "[Favoritism in allotment of cargo space.]  As the carrying power of\nthe annual galleon was by no means proportioned to the demand for\ncargo room, the governor divided it as he deemed best; the favorites,\nhowever, to whom he assigned shares in the hold, seldom traded\nthemselves, but parted with their concessions to the merchants.",
        "[Division of space and character of cargo.] According to De Guignes,\n[27] the hold of the vessel was divided into 1,500 parts, of which\nthe majority were allotted to the priests, and the rest to favored\npersons. As a matter of fact, the value of the cargo, which was\nofficially limited to $600,000, was considerably higher. It chiefly\nconsisted of Indian and Chinese cottons and silk stuffs (amongst\nothers fifty thousand pairs of silk stockings from China), and gold\nornaments. The value of the return freight amounted to between two\nand three millions of dollars.",
        "[Profit in trade.] Everything in this trade was settled beforehand;\nthe number, shape, size, and value of the bales, and even their selling\nprice. As this was usually double the original cost, the permission\nto ship goods to a certain amount was equivalent, under ordinary\ncircumstances, to the bestowal of a present of a like value. These\npermissions or licenses (boletas) were, at a later period, usually\ngranted to pensioners and officers’ widows, and to officials, in lieu\nof an increase of salary; these favorites were forbidden, however,\nto make a direct use of them, for to trade with Acapulco was the\nsole right of those members of the Consulado (a kind of chamber of\ncommerce) who could prove a long residence in the country and the\npossession of a capital of at least $8,000.",
        "[Evasion of regulations.] Legentil, the astronomer, gives a full\ndescription of the regulations which prevailed in his day and the\nmanner in which they were disobeyed. The cargo consisted of a thousand\nbales, each composed of four packets, [28] the maximum value of each\npacket being fixed at $250. It was impossible to increase the amount of\nbales, but they pretty generally consisted of more than four packets,\nand their value so far exceeded the prescribed limits, that a boleta\nwas considered to be worth from $200 to $225. The officials took good\ncare that no goods should be smuggled on board without a boleta. These\nwere in such demand, that, at a later period, Comyn [29] saw people\npay $500 for the right to ship goods, the value of which scarcely\namounted to $1,000. The merchants usually borrowed the money for these\nundertakings from the obras pias, charitable foundations, which, up\nto our own time, fulfil in the Islands the purposes of banks. [30]\nIn the early days of the trade, the galleon used to leave Cavite in\nJuly and sail with a south-westerly wind beyond the tropics, until\nit met with a west wind at the thirty-eighth or [Route outward.]\nfortieth parallel. [31] Later on the vessels were ordered to leave\nCavite with the first south-westerly winds to sail along the south\ncoast of Luzon, through San Bernardino straits, and to continue along\nthe thirteenth parallel of north latitude [32] as far to the east as\npossible, until the north-easterly trade wind compelled them to seek a\nnorth-west breeze in higher latitudes. They were then obliged to try\nthe thirtieth parallel as long as possible, instead of, as formerly,\nthe thirty-seventh. The captain of the galleon was not permitted\nto sail immediately northward, although to have done so would have\nprocured him a much quicker and safer passage, and would have enabled\nhim to reach the rainy zone more rapidly. To effect the last, indeed,\nwas a matter of the greatest importance to him, for his vessel,\noverladen [Water-supply crowded out by cargo.]  with merchandise,\nhad but little room crowded out for water; and although he had\na crew of from four hundred to six hundred hands to provide for,\nhe was instructed to depend upon the rain he caught on the voyage;\nfor which purpose, the galleon was provided with suitable mats and\nbamboo pails. [33]",
        "[Length of voyage.] Voyages in these low latitudes were, owing to the\ninconstancy of the winds, extremely troublesome, and often lasted five\nmonths and upwards. The fear of exposing the costly, cumbrous vessel\nto the powerful and sometimes stormy winds of the higher latitudes,\nappears to have been the cause of these sailing orders.",
        "[California landfall.] As soon as the galleon had passed the great\nSargasso shoal, it took a southerly course, and touched at the\nsouthern point of the Californian peninsula (San Lucas), where news\nand provisions awaited it. [34] In their earlier voyages, however,\nthey must have sailed much further to the north, somewhere in the\nneighborhood of Cape Mendocino, and have been driven southward in sight\nof the coast; for Vizcaino, in the voyage of discovery he undertook\nin 1603, from Mexico to California, found the principal mountains and\ncapes, although no European had ever set his foot upon them, already\nchristened by the galleons, to which they had served as landmarks.\n[35]",
        "[Speedy return voyage.] The return voyage to the Philippines was an\neasy one, and only occupied from forty to sixty days. [36] The galleon\nleft Acapulco in February or March, sailed southwards till it fell in\nwith the trade wind (generally in from 10° to 11° of north latitude),\nwhich carried it easily to the Ladrone Islands, and thence reached\nManila by way of Samar. [37]",
        "[Galleon’s size and armament.] A galleon was usually of from twelve\nhundred to fifteen hundred tons burden, and carried fifty or sixty\nguns. The latter, however, were pretty generally banished to the\nhold during the eastward voyage. When the ship’s bows were turned\ntowards home, and there was no longer any press of space, the guns\nwere remounted.",
        "[Capture of “Santa Anna”.] San Augustin says of the Santa Anna, which\nThomas Candish captured and burnt in 1586 off the Californian coast:\n\"Our people sailed so carelessly that they used their guns for ballast;\n.... the pirate’s venture was such a fortunate one that he returned\nto London with sails of Chinese damask and silken rigging.” The cargo\nwas sold in Acapulco at a profit of 100 per cent., and was paid for\nin silver, cochineal, quicksilver, etc. [Value of return freight]\nThe total value of the return freight amounted perhaps to between\ntwo and three million dollars, [38] of which a quarter of a million,\nat least, fell to the king.",
        "[Gambling rather than commerce] The return of a galleon to Manila,\nladen with silver dollars and new arrivals, was a great holiday\nfor the colony. A considerable portion of the riches they had won\nas easily as at the gaming table, was soon spent by the crew; when\nmatters again returned to their usual lethargic state. It was no\nunfrequent event, however, for vessels to be lost. They were too\noften laden with a total disregard to seaworthiness, and wretchedly\nhandled. It was favor, not capacity, that determined the patronage\nof these lucrative appointments. [39] Many galleons fell into the\nhands of English and Dutch cruisers. [40] [\"Philippine Company\"\nand smugglers cause change.] But these tremendous profits gradually\ndecreased as the Compañía obtained the right to import Indian\ncottons, one of the principal articles of trade, into New Spain by\nway of Vera Cruz, subject to a customs duty of 6 per cent; and when\nEnglish and American adventurers began to smuggle these and other\ngoods into the country. [41] [Spanish coins in circulation on China\ncoast.] Finally, it may be mentioned that Spanish dollars found their\nway in the galleons to China and the further Indies, where they are\nin circulation to this day.",
        "[The walled city of Manila.] The city proper of Manila, inhabited by\nSpaniards, Creoles, the Filipinos directly connected with them, and\nChinese, lies, surrounded by walls and wide ditches, on the left or\nsouthern bank of the Pasig, looking towards the sea. [42] It is a hot,\ndried-up place, full of monasteries, convents, barracks, and government\nbuildings. Safety, not appearance, was the object of its builders. It\nreminds the beholder of a Spanish provincial town, and is, next to Goa,\nthe oldest city in the Indies. Foreigners reside on the northern bank\nof the river; in Binondo, the headquarters of wholesale and retail\ncommerce, or in the pleasant suburban villages, which blend into\na considerable whole. [Population.] The total population of city\nand suburbs has been estimated, perhaps with some exaggeration,\nat 200,000. [Bridges.] A handsome old stone bridge of ten arches\nserves as the communication between the two banks of the Pasig,\nwhich, more recently, has also been spanned by an iron suspension\nbridge. [43] Very little intercourse exists between the inhabitants\nof Manila and Binondo. [Friction between classes.] Life in the city\nproper cannot be very pleasant; pride, envy, place-hunting, and caste\nhatred, are the order of the day; the Spaniards consider themselves\nsuperior to the creoles, who, in their turn, reproach the former with\nthe taunt that they have only come to the colony to save themselves\nfrom starvation. A similar hatred and envy exists between the whites\nand the mestizos. This state of things is to be found in all Spanish\ncolonies, and is chiefly caused by the colonial policy of Madrid,\nwhich always does its best to sow discord between the different races\nand classes of its foreign possessions, under the idea that their\nunion would imperil the sway of the mother country. [44]",
        "[Few large landowners.] In Manila, moreover, this state of things was\nrendered worse by the fact that the planter class, whose large landed\npossessions always give it a strong interest in the country of its\ninhabitance, was entirely wanting. At the present day, however, the\nincreasing demand for the produce of the colony seems to be bringing\nabout a pleasant change in this respect. [Spaniards transient.] The\nmanner in which the Spanish population of the Islands was affected\nby the gambling ventures of the galleons, at one time the only\nsource of commercial wealth, is thus described by Murillo Velarde\n(page 272):–\"The Spaniards who settle here look upon these Islands\nas a tavern rather than a permanent home. If they marry, it is by the\nmerest chance; where can a family be found that has been settled here\nfor several generations? The father amasses wealth, the son spends it,\nthe grandson is a beggar. The largest capitals are not more stable than\nthe waves of the ocean, across the crests of which they were gathered.”",
        "[Discomforts and the high cost of living.] There is nothing like\nthe same amount of sociability amongst the foreigners in Binondo as\nprevails in English and Dutch colonies; and scarcely any intercourse at\nall with the Spaniards, who envy the strangers and almost seem to look\nupon the gains the latter make in the country as so many robberies\ncommitted upon themselves, its owners. Besides all this, living is\nvery expensive, much more so than in Singapore and Batavia. To many,\nthe mere cost of existence seems greatly out of proportion to their\nofficial salaries. The (European style) houses, which are generally\nspacious, are gloomy and ugly, and not well ventilated for such a\nclimate. Instead of light jalousies, they are fitted with heavy sash\nwindows, which admit the light through thin oyster shells, forming\nsmall panes scarcely two square inches in area, and held together by\nlaths an inch thick. The ground floors of the houses are, on account\nof the great damp, sensibly enough, generally uninhabited; and are\nused as cellars, stables, and servant’s offices.",
        "[Native houses comfortable and unchanged.] The unassuming, but for\ntheir purposes very practical houses, of boards, bamboos, and (nipa)\npalm leaves, are supported on account of the damp on isolated beams\nor props; and the space beneath, which is generally fenced in with\na railing, is used as a stable or a warehouse; such was the case\nas early as the days of Magellan. These dwellings [45] are very\nlightly put together. La Pérouse estimates the weight of some of them,\nfurniture and all, at something less than two hundred pounds. Nearly\nall these houses, as well as the huts of the natives, are furnished\nwith an azotea, that is, an uncovered space, on the same level as the\ndwelling, which takes the place of yard and balcony. The Spaniards\nappear to have copied this useful contrivance from the Moors, but the\nnatives were acquainted with them before the arrival of the Europeans,\nfor Morga mentions similar batalanes.",
        "[Neglected river and canals offensive.] In the suburbs nearly every\nhut stands in its own garden. The river is often quite covered with\ngreen scum; and dead cats and dogs surrounded with weeds, which look\nlike cabbage-lettuce, frequently adorn its waters. In the dry season,\nthe numerous canals of the suburbs are so many stagnant drains,\nand at each ebb of the tide the ditches around the town exhibit a\nsimilar spectacle.",
        "[Dreary and unprogressive life.] Manila offers very few opportunities\nfor amusement. There was no Spanish theatre open during my stay there,\nbut Tagalog plays (translations) were sometimes represented. The town\npossessed no club, and contained no readable books. Never once did\nthe least excitement enliven its feeble newspapers, for the items\nof intelligence, forwarded fortnightly from Hongkong, were sifted by\npriestly censors, who left little but the chronicles of the Spanish\nand French courts to feed the barren columns of the local sheets. [46]\nThe pompously celebrated religious festivals were the only events\nthat sometimes chequered the wearisome monotony.",
        "[Cock-fighting.] The chief amusement of the Filipinos is cock-fighting,\nwhich is carried on with a passionate eagerness that must strike every\nstranger. Nearly every man keeps a fighting cock. Many are never seen\nout of doors without their favorite in their arms; they pay as much\nas $50 and upwards for these pets, and heap the tenderest caresses\non them. The passion for cock-fighting can well be termed a national\nvice; but the practice may have been introduced by the Spaniards, or\nthe Mexicans who accompanied them, as, in a like manner, the habit of\nsmoking opium among the Chinese, which has become a national curse,\nwas first introduced by the English. [Probably Malay Custom.] It is,\nhowever, more probable that the Malays brought the custom into the\ncountry. In the eastern portion of the Philippines, cock-fighting\nwas unknown in the days of Pigafetta. The first cock-fight he met\nwith was at Palawan. “They keep large cocks, which from a species of\nsuperstition, they never eat, but keep for fighting purposes. Heavy\nbets are made on the upshot of the contest, which are paid to the\nowner of the winning bird.” [47] The sight is one extremely repulsive\nto Europeans. [The cockpit.] The ring around the cockpit is crowded\nwith men, perspiring at every pore, while their countenances bear\nthe imprint of the ugliest passions. Each bird is armed with a sharp\ncurved spur, three inches long capable of making deep wounds, and which\nalways causes the death of one or both birds by the serious injuries it\ninflicts. If a cock shows symptoms of fear and declines the encounter,\nit is plucked alive. Incredibly large sums, in proportion to the means\nof the gamblers, are wagered on the result. [Its bad influence.] It\nis very evident that these cock-fights must have a most demoralising\neffect upon a people so addicted to idleness and dissipation, and so\naccustomed to give way to the impulse of the moment. Their effect\nis to make them little able to resist the temptation of procuring\nmoney without working for it. The passion for the game leads many\nto borrow at usury, to embezzlement, to theft, and even to  highway\nrobbery. The land and sea pirates, of whom I shall speak presently,\nare principally composed of ruined gamesters. [48]",
        "[Feminine attractiveness.] In the comeliness of the women who\nlend animation to its streets Manila surpasses all other towns in\nthe Indian Archipelago. Mallat describes them in glowing colors. A\ncharming picture of Manila street life, full of local color, is given\nin the very amusing Aventures d’un Gentilhomme Breton. [49]",
        "[Mestizas.] How many of the prettiest Filipinas are of perfectly\nunmixed blood, it is, I confess, difficult to decide. Many of them\nare very fair and of quite an European type, and are thereby easily\ndistinguished from their sisters in the outlying provinces. The\nimmediate environs of Manila can boast many beautiful spots, but\nthey are not the resort of the local rank and fashion, the object\nof whose daily promenade is the display of their toilettes, and not\nthe enjoyment of nature. In the hot season, all who can afford it\nare driven every evening along the [The Luneta.] dusty streets to\na promenade on the beach, which was built a short time back, where\nseveral times a week the band of a native regiment plays fairly good\nmusic, and there walk formally up and down. All the Spaniards [The\nAngelas.] are in uniform or in black frock coats. When the bells ring\nout for evening prayer, carriages, horsemen, pedestrians, all suddenly\nstand motionless; the men take off their hats, and everybody appears\nmomentarily absorbed in prayer.",
        "[Botanical gardens.] The same governor who laid out the promenade\nestablished a botanical garden. It is true that everything he planted\nin it, exposed on a marshy soil to the full heat of a powerful sun,\nsoon faded away; but its ground was enclosed and laid out, and though\nit was overgrown with weeds, it had at least received a name. At\npresent it is said to be in better condition. [50]",
        "[Pretty girls in gay garments.] The religious festivals in the\nneighborhood of Manila are well worth a visit, if only for the sake\nof the numerous pretty Filipinas and mestizas in their best clothes\nwho make their appearance in the evening and promenade up and down\nthe streets, which are illuminated and profusely decked with flowers\nand bright colors. They offer a charming spectacle, particularly\nto a stranger lately arrived from Malaysia. The Filipinas are very\nbeautifully formed. They have luxuriant black hair, and large dark\neyes; the upper part of their bodies is clad in a homespun but often\ncostly material of transparent fineness and snow-white purity; and,\nfrom their waist downwards, they are wrapped in a brightly-striped\ncloth (saya), which falls in broad folds, and which, as far as the\nknee, is so tightly compressed with a dark shawl (lapis), closely drawn\naround the figure, that the rich variegated folds of the saya burst\nout beneath it like the blossoms of a pomegranate. This swathing only\nallows the young girls to take very short steps, and this timidity of\ngait, in unison with their downcast eyes, gives them a very modest\nappearance. On their naked feet they wear embroidered slippers of\nsuch a small size that their little toes protrude for want of room,\nand grasp the outside of the sandal. [51]",
        "[Dress of the poorer women.] The poorer women clothe themselves in a\nsaya and in a so-called chemise, which is so extremely short that it\nfrequently does not even reach the first fold of the former. In the\nmore eastern islands grown-up girls and women wear, with the exception\nof a Catholic amulet, nothing but these two garments, which are,\nparticularly after bathing, and before they get dried by the sun,\nnearly transparent.",
        "[Men’s clothing.] A hat, trousers, and a shirt worn outside them,\nboth made of coarse Guinara cloth, compose the dress of the men of\nthe poorer classes. The shirts worn by the wealthy are often made\nof an extremely expensive home-made material, woven from the fibers\nof the pineapple or the banana. Some of them are ornamented with\nsilk stripes, some are plain. They are also frequently manufactured\nentirely of jusi (Chinese floret silk), in which case they will not\nstand washing, and can only be worn once. The hat (salacot), a round\npiece of home-made plaiting, is used as both umbrella and sunshade,\nand is often adorned with silver ornaments of considerable value. [The\n\"Principales”.] The principalia class enjoy the special privilege\nof wearing short jackets above their shirts, and are usually easily\nrecognizable by their amusing assumption of dignity, and by the faded\ncylindrical hats, yellow with age, family heirlooms, constantly\nworn. [The dandies.] The native dandies wear patent leather shoes\non their naked feet, tight-fitting trousers of some material striped\nwith black and white or with some other glaringly-contrasted colors,\na starched plaited shirt of European make, a chimney-pot silk hat,\nand carry a cane in their hands. [The servants.] The servants waiting\nat dinner in their white starched shirts and trousers are by no means\nan agreeable spectacle, and I never realised the full ludicrousness\nof European male costume till my eye fell upon its caricature,\nexemplified in the person of a “Manila dandy.”",
        "[Mestiza costume.] The mestizas dress like the Filipinas, but do not\nwear the tapis, and those of them who are married to Europeans are\ngenerally clad in both shoes and stockings. Many of the mestizas are\nextremely pretty, but their gait drags a little, from their habit of\nwearing slippers. As a rule they are prudent, thrifty, and [Clever\nbusiness women.] clever business women, but their conversation is\noften awkward and tedious. Their want of education is, however, not\nthe cause of this latter failing, for Andalusian women who never learn\nanything but the elementary doctrines of Christianity, are among the\nmost charming creatures in the world, in their youth. [Ill at ease\nin society.] Its cause lies rather in this equivocal position; they\nare haughtily repelled by their white sisters, whilst they themselves\ndisown their mother’s kin. They are wanting in the ease, in the tact,\nthat the women of Spain show in every relation of existence.",
        "[Mestizos.] The mestizos, particularly those born of Chinese and Tagal\nmothers, constitute the richest and the most enterprising portion of\nthe native population. They are well acquainted with all the good and\nbad qualities of the Filipino inhabitants, and use them unscrupulously\nfor their own purposes.",
        "[Native distrust of Europeans.] A Scotch merchant to whom I brought\na letter of introduction invited me with such cordiality to come\nand stay with him, that I found myself unable to refuse. While thus\nliving under the roof and protection of one of the wealthiest and most\nrespected men in the city, the cabmen I employed insisted on being\npaid beforehand every time I rode in their vehicles. This distrust was\noccasioned by the scanty feeling of respect most of the Europeans in\nManila inspired in the minds of the natives. Many later observations\nconfirmed this impression. What a different state of things exists\nin Java and Singapore! The reason, however, is easily explained.",
        "[Dutch and English stand well in their colonies.] The Dutch are as\nlittle able as the English to acclimatize themselves in tropical\ncountries. They get all they can out of countries in which they are\nonly temporary sojourners, the former by forced service and monopoly,\nthe latter by commerce. In both cases, however, the end is accomplished\nby comparatively few individuals, whose official position and the\nlargeness of whose undertakings place them far above the mass of the\npopulation. In Java, moreover, the Europeans constitute the governing\nclasses, the natives the governed; and even in Singapore where both\nraces are equal before the law the few white men understand how to mark\nthe difference of race so distinctively that the natives without demur\nsurrender to them, though not by means of the law, the privileges of a\nhigher caste. The difference of religion does but widen the gap; and,\nfinally, every European there speaks the language of the country, while\nthe natives are totally ignorant of that spoken by the foreigners.",
        "[Dutch colonials well educated.] The Dutch officials are educated at\nhome in schools specially devoted to the East Indian service. The art\nof managing the natives, the upholding of prestige, which is considered\nthe secret of the Dutch power over the numerous native populations,\nforms an essential particular in their education. The Dutch, therefore,\nmanage their intercourse with the natives, no matter how much they\nintend to get out of them, in strict accordance with customary usage\n(adat); they never wound the natives’ amor propio and never expose\nthemselves in their own mutual intercourse, which remains a sealed\nbook to the inhabitants.",
        "[Spanish officials undesirables.] Things are different in the\nPhilippines. With the exception of those officials whose stay is\nlimited by the rules of the service, or by the place-hunting that\nensues at every change in the Spanish ministry, few Spaniards who\nhave once settled in the colony ever return home. It is forbidden\nto the priests, and most of the rest have no means of doing so. A\nconsiderable portion of them consist of subaltern officers, soldiers,\nsailors, political delinquents and refugees whom the mother-country\nhas got rid of; and not seldom of adventurers deficient both in means\nand desire for the journey back, for their life in the colony is far\npleasanter than that they were forced to lead in Spain. These latter\narrive without the slightest knowledge of the country and without\nbeing in the least prepared for a sojourn there. Many of them are so\nlazy that they won’t take the trouble to learn the language even if\nthey marry a daughter of the soil. Their servants understand Spanish,\nand clandestinely watch the conversation and the actions, and become\nacquainted with all the secrets, of their indiscreet masters, to\nwhom the Filipinos remain an enigma which their conceit prevents them\nattempting to decipher.",
        "[Spanish lack of prestige deserved.] It is easy to understand how\nFilipino respect for Europeans must be diminished by the numbers of\nthese uneducated, improvident, and extravagant Spaniards, who, no\nmatter what may have been their position at home, are all determined\nto play the master in the colony. [Social Standing of Filipinos thus\nenhanced.] The relative standing of the Filipinos naturally profits\nby all this and it would be difficult to find a colony in which\nthe natives, taken all in all, feel more comfortable than in the\nPhilippines. They have adopted the religion, the manners, and the\ncustoms of their rulers; and though legally not on an equal footing\nwith the latter, they are by no means separated from them by the\nhigh barriers with which, not to mention Java, the churlish reserve\nof the English has surrounded the natives of the other colonies.",
        "[Spanish-Filipino bonds of union.] The same religion, a similar form\nof worship, an existence intermixed with that of the indigenous\npopulation, all tend to bring the Europeans and the Indians\ntogether. That they have done so is proved by the existence of the\nproportionately very numerous band of mestizos who inhabit the Islands.",
        "[Latin races better for colonists in the tropics.] The Spaniards\nand the Portuguese appear, in fact, to be the only Europeans who\ntake root in tropical countries. They are capable of permanent and\nfruitful amalgamation [52] with the natives. [53]",
        "[Initiative and individuality missing.] The want of originality, which\namong the mestizos, appears to arise from their equivocal position,\nis also to be found among the natives. Distinctly marked national\ncustoms, which one would naturally expect to find in such an isolated\npart of the world, are sought for in vain, and again and again the\nstranger remarks that everything has been learned and is only a veneer.",
        "[A compromise civilization.] As Spain forcibly expelled the\ncivilization of the Moors, and in Peru that of the Incas, so in the\nPhilippines it has understood how to set aside an equally well-founded\none, by appropriating in an incredible manner, in order to take root\nitself the more quickly, all existing forms and abuses. [54]",
        "[Imitation instilled and self-respect banished.] The uncivilized\ninhabitants of the Philippines quickly adopted the rites, forms,\nand ceremonies of the strange religion, and, at the same time, copied\nthe personal externalities of their new masters, learning to despise\ntheir own manners and customs as heathenish and barbarian. Nowadays,\nforsooth, they sing Andalusian songs, and dance Spanish dances; but\nin what sort of way? They imitate everything that passes before their\neyes without using their intelligence to appreciate it. It is this\nwhich makes both themselves and their artistic productions wearisome,\ndevoid of character, and, I may add, unnatural, in spite of the skill\nand patience they devote to them. These two peculiarities, moreover,\nare invariably to be found amongst nations whose civilization is but\nlittle developed; the patience so much admired is often nothing but\nwaste of time and breath, quite out of proportion to the end in view,\nand the skill is the mere consequence of the backward state of the\ndivision of labor.",
        "[Educated Filipino unnatural.] If I entered the house of a well-to-do\nFilipino, who spoke Spanish, I was received with the same phrases his\nmodel, a Spaniard, would employ; but I always had the feeling that it\nwas out of place. In countries where the native population remains\ntrue to its ancient customs this is not the case; and whenever I\nhave not been received with proper respect, I have remarked that the\napparent fact proceeded from a difference in social forms, not more\nto be wondered at than a difference in weights and measures. In Java,\nand particularly in Borneo and the Moluccas, the utensils in daily use\nare ornamented with so refined a feeling for form and color, that they\nare praised by our artists as patterns of ornamentation and afford\na proof that the labor is one of love, and that it is presided over\nby an acute intelligence. [Native art-sense spoiled.] Such a sense\nof beauty is seldom to be met with in the Philippines. Everything\nthere is imitation or careless makeshift. Even the piña embroideries,\nwhich are fabricated with such wonderful patience and skill, and\nare so celebrated for the fineness of the work, are, as a rule,\nspiritless imitations of Spanish patterns. One is involuntarily\nled to these conclusions by a comparison of the art products of the\nSpanish-American communities with those of more barbarous races. The\nBerlin Ethnographical Museum contains many proofs of the facts I have\njust mentioned.",
        "[Indolence from absence of incentive.] The oars used in the\nPhilippines are usually made of bamboo poles, with a board tied to\ntheir extremities with strips of rattan. If they happen to break, so\nmuch the better; for the fatiguing labor of rowing must necessarily\nbe suspended till they are mended again.",
        "[Carelessness from lack of responsibility.] In Java the carabao-carts,\nwhich are completely covered in as a protection against the rain,\nare ornamented with many tasteful patterns. The roofless wagons used\nin the Philippines are roughly put together at the last moment. When\nit is necessary to protect their contents from the wet, an old pair\nof mats is thrown over them, more for the purpose of appeasing the\nprejudices of the “Castilians” than really to keep off the rain.",
        "[Weakened character and want of dignity.] The English and the Dutch are\nalways looked upon as strangers in the tropics; their influence never\ntouches the ancient native customs which culminate in the religion of\nthe country. But the populations whom the Spaniards have converted to\ntheir religion have lost all originality, all sense of nationality;\nyet the alien religion has never really penetrated into their inmost\nbeing, they never feel it to be a source of moral support, and it is\nno accidental coincidence that they are all more or less stamped with\na want of dignity....",
        "[Spanish rule not benevolent, but beneficial.] With the exception of\nthis want of national individuality, and the loss of the distinguishing\nmanners and customs which constitute the chief charm of most eastern\npeoples, the Filipino is an interesting study of a type of mankind\nexisting in the easiest natural conditions. The arbitrary rule of\ntheir chiefs, and the iron shackles of slavery, were abolished by the\nSpaniards shortly after their arrival; and peace and security reigned\nin the place of war and rapine. The Spanish rule in these Islands was\nalways a mild one, not because the laws, which treated the natives\nlike children, were wonderfully gentle, but because the causes did\nnot exist which caused such scandalous cruelties in Spanish America\nand in the colonies of other nations.",
        "[Circumstances have favored the Filipinos.] It was fortunate for\nthe Filipinos that their islands possessed no wealth in the shape of\nprecious metals or valuable spices. In the earlier days of maritime\ntraffic there was little possibility of exporting the numerous\nagricultural productions of the colony; and it was scarcely worth\nwhile, therefore, to make the most of the land. The few Spaniards\nwho resided in the colony found such an easy method of making money\nin the commerce with China and Mexico, by means of the galleons,\nthat they held themselves aloof from all economical enterprises,\nwhich had little attraction for their haughty inclinations, and\nwould have imposed the severest labor on the Filipinos. Taking into\nconsideration the wearisome and dangerous navigation of the time,\nit was, moreover, impossible for the Spaniards, upon whom their too\nlarge possessions in America already imposed an exhausting man-tax,\nto maintain a strong armed force in the Philippines. The subjection,\nwhich had been inaugurated by a dazzling military exploit, was chiefly\naccomplished by the assistance of the friar orders, whose missionaries\nwere taught to employ extreme prudence and patience. The Philippines\nwere thus principally won by a peaceful conquest.",
        "[Have fared better than the Mexicans.] The taxes laid upon the peoples\nwere so trifling that they did not suffice for the administration\nof the colony. The difference was covered by yearly contributions\nfrom Mexico. The extortions of unconscientious officials were by no\nmeans conspicuous by their absence. Cruelties, however, such as were\npractised in the American mining districts, or in the manufactures\nof Quito, never occurred in the Philippines.",
        "[A land of opportunity.] Uncultivated land was free, and was at\nthe service of any one willing to make it productive; if, however,\nit remained untilled for two years, it reverted to the crown. [55]",
        "[Low taxes.] The only tax which the Filipinos pay is the poll-tax,\nknown as the tributo, which originally, three hundred years ago,\namounted to one dollar for every pair of adults, and in a country\nwhere all marry early, and the sexes are equally divided, really\nconstituted a family-tax. By degrees the tribute has been raised to\ntwo and one-sixteenth dollars. An adult, therefore, male or female,\npays one and one-thirty-second dollar, and that from his sixteenth to\nhis sixtieth year. Besides this, every man has to give forty days’\nlabor every year to the State. This vassalage (polos y servicios)\nis divided into ordinary and extraordinary services: the first\nconsists of the duties appertaining to a watchman or messenger, in\ncleaning the courts of justice, and in other light labors; the second\nin road-making, and similar heavier kinds of work, for the benefit\nof villages and provinces. The little use, however, that is made of\nthese services, is shown by the fact that any one can obtain a release\nfrom them for a sum which at most is not more than three dollars. No\npersonal service is required of women. A little further on, important\ndetails about the tax from official sources, which were placed at my\ndisposal in the colonial office, appear in a short special chapter.",
        "[Fortunate factors.] In other countries, with an equally mild climate,\nand an equally fertile soil, the natives, unless they had reached a\nhigher degree of civilization than that of the Philippine Islanders,\nwould have been ground down by native princes, or ruthlessly plundered\nand destroyed by foreigners. In these isolated Islands, so richly\nendowed by nature, where pressure from above, impulse from within,\nand every stimulus from the outside are wanting, the satisfaction\nof a few trifling wants is sufficient for an existence with ample\ncomfort. Of all countries in the world, the Philippines have the\ngreatest claim to be considered a lotos-eating Utopia. The traveller,\nwhose knowledge of the dolce far niente is derived from Naples,\nhas no real appreciation of it; it only blossoms under the shade of\npalm-trees. These notes of travel will contain plenty of examples to\nsupport this. One trip across the Pasig gives a foretaste of life\nin the interior of the country. Low wooden cabins and bamboo huts,\nsurmounted with green foliage and blossoming flowers, are picturesquely\ngrouped with areca palms, and tall, feather-headed bamboos, upon its\nbanks. Sometimes the enclosures run down into the stream itself, some\nof them being duck-grounds, and others bathing-places. The shore is\nfringed with canoes, nets, rafts, and fishing apparatus. Heavily-laden\nboats float down the stream, and small canoes ply from bank to bank\nbetween the groups of bathers. The most lively traffic is to be seen\nin the tiendas, large sheds, corresponding to the Javanese harongs,\nwhich open upon the river, the great channel for traffic.",
        "[River resorts.] They are a source of great attraction to the\npassing sailors, who resort to them for eating, drinking, and other\nconvivialities; and while away the time there in gambling, betel\nchewing, and smoking, with idle companions of both sexes.",
        "[Sleeping pilots.] At times somebody may be seen floating down\nthe stream asleep on a heap of coconuts. If the nuts run ashore,\nthe sleeper rouses himself, pushes off with a long bamboo, and\ncontentedly relapses into slumber, as his eccentric raft regains\nthe current of the river. One cut of his bolo-knife easily detaches\nsufficient of the husk of the nuts to allow of their being fastened\ntogether; in this way a kind of wreath is formed which encircles and\nholds together the loose nuts piled up in the middle.",
        "[Labor-saving conditions.] The arduous labors of many centuries\nhave left as their legacy a perfect system of transport; but in\nthese Islands man can obtain many of his requirements direct with\nproportionately trifling labor, and a large amount of comfort for\nhimself.",
        "[Easy food.] Off the Island of Talim, in the great Lagoon of Bay, my\nboatmen bought for a few cuartos several dozens of fish quite twelve\ninches long; and those which they couldn’t eat were split open, salted,\nand dried by a few hours’ exposure to the heat of the sun on the roof\nof the boat. When the fishermen had parted with their contemplated\nbreakfast, they stooped down and filled their cooking-vessels with\nsand-mussels (paludina costata, 2.a G.), first throwing away the\ndead ones from the handfuls they picked up from the bottom of the\nshallow water.",
        "[River’s importance.] Nearly all the dwellings are built by the water’s\nedge. The river is a natural self-maintaining highway, on which loads\ncan be carried to the foot of the mountains. The huts of the people,\nbuilt upon piles, are to be seen thickly scattered about its banks,\nand particularly about its broad mouths. The appropriateness of\ntheir position is evident, for the stream is at once the very\ncenter of activity and the most convenient spot for the pursuit\nof their callings. At each tide the takes of fish are more or less\nplentiful, and at low-water the women and children may be seen picking\nup shell-fish with their toes, for practice has enabled them to use\ntheir toes as deftly as their fingers, or gathering in the sand-crabs\nand eatable seaweed.",
        "[Riverside gaiety.]  The riverside is a pretty sight when men, women,\nand children are bathing and frolicking in the shade of the palm-trees;\nand others are filling their water-vessels, large bamboos, which they\ncarry on their shoulders, or jars, which they bear on their heads;\nand when the boys are standing upright on the broad backs of the\ncarabaos and riding triumphantly into the water.",
        "[Coco-palms.] It is here too that the coco-palm most flourishes, a tree\nthat supplies not only their food and drink, but also every material\nnecessary for the construction of huts and the manufacture of the\nvarious articles which they use. While the greatest care is necessary\nto make those growing further inland bear even a little fruit, the\npalm-trees close to the shore, even when planted on wretched soil,\ngrow plentiful crops without the slightest trouble. Has a palm-tree\never been made to blossom in a hothouse? Thomson [56] mentions that\ncoco-trees growing by the sea-side are wont to incline their stems over\nthe ocean, the waters of which bear their fruit to desert shores and\nislands, and render them habitable for mankind. Thus the coco-tree\nwould seem to play an essential part in the ocean vagabondage of\nMalaysia and Polynesia.",
        "[Nipa-palms.] Close to the coco-trees grow clumps of the stunted\nnipa-palms, which only flourish in brackish waters; [57] their\nleaves furnish the best roof-thatching. Sugar, brandy, and vinegar\nare manufactured from their sap. Three hundred and fifty years ago\nPigafetta found these manufactures in full swing, but nowadays\nthey seem to be limited to the Philippines. Besides these, the\npandanus-tree, from the leaves of which the softest mats are woven,\nis always found in near proximity to the shore.",
        "[Fertile fields.] Towards the interior the landscape is covered with\nrice-fields, which yearly receive a fresh layer of fertile soil,\nwashed down from the mountains by the river, and spread over their\nsurface by the overflowing of its waters; and which in consequence\nnever require any fertilizer. [The carabao.] The carabao, the favorite\ndomestic animal of the Malays, and which they keep especially for\nagricultural purposes, prefers these regions to all others. It loves\nto wallow in the mud, and is not fit for work unless permitted to\nfrequent the water.",
        "[Bamboo.] Bamboos with luxuriant leafy tops grow plentifully by the\nhuts in the rice-fields which fringe the banks of the river. In my\nformer sketches of travel I have endeavored to describe how much\nthis gigantic plant contributes to the comfort and convenience of\ntropical life. Since then I have become acquainted with many curious\npurposes to which it is turned, but to describe them here would be\nout of place.  [58] I may be allowed, however, to briefly cite a\nfew examples showing what numerous results are obtained from simple\nmeans. Nature has endowed these splendid plants, which perhaps surpass\nall others in beauty, with so many useful qualities, and delivered\nthem into the hands of mankind so ready for immediate use, that a\nfew sharp cuts suffice to convert them into all kinds of various\nutensils. [Strength.] The bamboo possesses, in proportion to its\nlightness, an extraordinary strength; the result of its round shape,\nand the regularity of the joints in its stem. The parallel position and\ntoughness of its fibers render it easy to split, and, when split, its\npieces are of extraordinary pliability and elasticity. To the gravelly\nsoil on which it grows it owes its durability, and its firm, even,\nand always clean surface, the brilliancy and color of which improve by\nuse. [Convenience.] And finally, it is a great thing for a population\nwith such limited means of conveyance that the bamboo is to be found\nin such abundance in all kinds of localities and of all dimensions,\nfrom a few millimeters to ten or fifteen centimeters in diameter,\neven sometimes to twice this amount; and that, on account of its\nunsurpassed floating power, it is pre-eminently fitted for locomotion\nin a country poor in roads but rich in watercourses. A blow with a bolo\nis generally enough to cut down a strong stem. [Usefulness.] If the\nthin joints are taken away, hollow stems of different thicknesses can\nbe slid into one another like the parts of a telescope. From bamboos\nsplit in half, gutters, troughs, and roofing tiles can be made. Split\ninto several slats, which can be again divided into small strips and\nfibers for the manufacture of baskets, ropes, mats, and fine plaiting\nwork, they can be made into frames and stands. Two cuts in the same\nplace make a round hole through which a stem of corresponding diameter\ncan be firmly introduced. If a similar opening is made in a second\nupright, the horizontal stem can be run through both. Gates, closing\nperpendicularly or horizontally in frames moving without friction on\na perpendicular or horizontal axis, can be made in this way.",
        "Two deep cuts give an angular shape to the stem; and when its two sides\nare wide enough apart to admit of a cross-stem being placed between\nthem, they can be employed as roof-ridges or for the framework of\ntables and chairs; a quantity of flat split pieces of bamboo being\nfastened on top of them with chair-cane. These split pieces then\nform the seats of the chairs and the tops of the tables, instead of\nthe boards and large bamboo laths used at other times. It is equally\neasy to make an oblong opening in a large bamboo in which to fit the\nlaths of a stand.",
        "A couple of cuts are almost enough to make a fork, a pair of tongs\nor a hook.",
        "If one makes a hole as big as the end of one’s finger in a large\nbamboo close under a joint, one obtains by fastening a small piece of\ncloth to the open end, a syphon or a filter. If a piece of bamboo is\nsplit down to the joint in strips, and the strips be bound together\nwith others horizontally interlaced, it makes a conical basket. If\nthe strips are cut shorter, it makes a peddler’s pack basket. If\na long handle is added, and it is filled with tar, it can be used\nas a signal torch. If shallower baskets of the same dimensions,\nbut with their bottoms cut off or punched out, are placed inside\nthese conical ones, the two together make capital snare baskets for\ncrabs and fish. If a bamboo stem be cut off just below the joint,\nand its lower edge be split up into a cogged rim, it makes, when the\npartition of the joint is punched out, an earth-auger, a fountain-pipe,\nand many things of the kind.",
        "[Pleasures of travel.] Strangers travelling in the interior have\ndaily fresh opportunities of enjoying the hospitality of nature. The\natmosphere is so equitably warm that one would gladly dispense with\nall clothing except a sun-hat and a pair of light shoes. Should one\nbe tempted to pass the night in the open air, the construction of a\nhut from the leaves of the palm and the fern is the work of a few\nminutes; [Village rest houses.] but in even the smallest village\nthe traveller finds a “common house” (casa real), in which he can\ntake up his quarters and be supplied with the necessaries of life\nat the market price. There too he will always meet with semaneros\n(those who perform menial duties) ready to serve him as messengers\nor porters for the most trifling remuneration. But long practice\nhas taught me that their services principally consist in doing\nnothing. On one occasion I wanted to send a man who was playing\ncards and drinking tuba (fresh or weakly-fermented palm-sap) with his\ncompanions, on an errand. [Pleasant prison life.] Without stopping his\ngame the fellow excused himself on the ground of being a prisoner,\nand one of his guardians proceeded in the midst of the intense heat\nto carry my troublesome message. Prisoners have certainly little\ncause to grumble. [Frequent floggings little regarded.] The only\ninconvenience to which they are exposed are the floggings which the\nlocal authorities very liberally dispense by the dozens for the most\ntrifling offences. Except the momentary bodily pain, however, these\nappear in most cases to make little impression on a people who have\nbeen accustomed to corporal punishment from their youth upwards. Their\nacquaintances stand round the sufferers, while the blows are being\ninflicted, and mockingly ask them how it tastes.",
        "[Change from Malayan character.] A long residence amongst the earnest,\nquiet, and dignified Malays, who are most anxious for their honor,\nwhile most submissive to their superiors, makes the contrast in\ncharacter exhibited by the natives of the Philippines, who yet belong\nto the Malay race, all the more striking. The change in their nature\nappears to be a natural consequence of the Spanish rule, for the same\ncharacteristics may be observed in the natives of Spanish America. The\nclass distinctions and the despotic oppression prevalent under their\nformer chiefs doubtless rendered the Filipinos of the past more like\nthe Malays of today.",
        "[The familiar field for travellers.] The environs of Manila, the Pasig,\nand the Lagoon of Bay, which are visited by every fresh arrival in the\ncolony, have been so often described that I have restricted myself\nto a few short notes upon these parts of the country, and intend to\nrelate in detail only my excursions into the south-eastern provinces\nof Luzon, Camarines, and Albay, and the islands which lie to the east\nof them, Samar and Leyte. Before doing this, however, it will not be\nout of place to glance at the map and give some slight description\nof their geographical conditions.",
        "[Archipelago’s great extent.] The Philippine Archipelago lies between\nBorneo and Formosa, and separates the northern Pacific Ocean from the\nChina Sea. It covers fourteen and one-half degrees of latitude, and\nextends from the Sulu Islands in the south, in the fifth parallel of\nnorth latitude, to the Babuyans in the north in latitude 19° 30’. If,\nhowever, the Bashee or Batanes Islands be included, its area may be\nsaid to extend to the twenty-first parallel of north latitude. But\nneither southwards or northwards does Spanish rule extend to these\nextreme limits, nor, in fact, does it always reach the far interior\nof the larger islands. From the eastern to the western extremity of\nthe Philippines the distance is about nine degrees of longitude. Two\nislands, Luzon, with an area of two thousand, and Mindanao, with one of\nmore than one thousand five hundred square miles, are together larger\nthan all the rest. The seven next largest islands are Palawan, Samar,\nPanay, Mindoro, Leyte, Negros, and Cebu; of which the first measures\nabout two hundred and fifty, and the last about one hundred square\nmiles. Then come Bohol and Masbate, each about half the size of Cebu;\ntwenty smaller islands, still of some importance; and numerous tiny\nislets, rocks, and reefs.",
        "[Favored by position and conditions.] The Philippines are extremely\nfavored by their position and conditions. Their extension from\nnorth to south, over 16° of latitude, obtains for them a variety of\nclimate which the Dutch Indies, whose largest diameter, their extent\nin latitude north and south of the equator being but trifling, runs\nfrom the east to the west, by no means enjoy. The advantages accruing\nfrom their neighborhood to the equator are added to those acquired\nfrom the natural variety of their climate; and the produce of both the\ntorrid and temperate zones, the palm-tree and the fir, the pine-apple,\nthe corn ear and the potato, flourish side by side upon their shores.",
        "[Harbors and water highways.] The larger islands contain vast inland\nseas, considerable navigable rivers, and many creeks running far\ninto the interior; they are rich, too, in safe harbors and countless\nnatural ports of refuge for ships in distress. Another attribute\nwhich, though not to be realized by a glance at the map, is yet one\nof the most fortunate the Islands possess, is the countless number\nof small streams which pour down from the inland hills, and open out,\nere they reach the ocean, into broad estuaries; up these watercourses\ncoasting vessels of shallow draught can sail to the very foot of the\nmountains and take in their cargo. [Soil and sea alike productive.] The\nfertility of the soil is unsurpassed; both the sea around the coasts\nand the inland lakes swarm with fish and shell-fish, while in the whole\narchipelago there is scarcely a wild beast to be found. It seems that\nonly two civets happen to appear: Miro (paradoxurus philippinensis\nTem.) and galong (viverra tangalunga Gray). Luzon surpasses all the\nother islands, not only in size, but in importance; and its fertility\nand other natural superiority well entitle it to be called, as it is\nby Crawfurd, “the most beautiful spot in the tropics.”",
        "[Luzon.] The mainland of the isle of Luzon stretches itself in a\ncompact long quadrangle, twenty-five miles broad, from 18° 40’ north\nlatitude to the Bay of Manila (14° 30’); and then projects, amid\nlarge lakes and deep creeks, a rugged promontory to the east, joined\nto the main continent by but two narrow isthmuses which stretch east\nand west of the large inland Lagoon of Bay. Many traces of recent\nupheavals betoken that the two portions were once separated and\nformed two distinct islands. The large eastern promontory, well-nigh\nas long as the northern portion, is nearly cut in half by two deep\nbays, which, starting from opposite points on the south-eastern\nand north-western coasts, almost merge their waters in the center\nof the peninsula; the Bay of Ragay, and the Bay of Sogod. In fact,\nthe southern portion of Luzon may be better described as two small\npeninsulas lying next to one another in parallel positions, and joined\ntogether by a narrow neck of land scarcely three miles broad. Two small\nstreams which rise nearly in the same spot and pour themselves into\nthe two opposite gulfs, make the separation almost complete, and form\nat the same time the boundary between the province of Tayabas on the\nwest, and that of Camarines on the east. The western portion, indeed,\nconsists almost entirely of the first-named district, and the eastern\nis divided into the provinces of North Camarines, South Camarines,\nand Albay. The first of these three is divided from Tayabas by the\nboundary already mentioned, and from South Camarines by a line drawn\nfrom the southern shore of the Bay of San Miguel on the north to the\nopposite coast. The eastern extremity of the peninsula forms the\nprovince of Albay; separated from South Camarines by a line which\nruns from Donzol, on the south coast, northwards across the volcano\nof Mayon, and which then, inclining to the west, reaches the northern\nshore. A look at the map will make these explanations clearer.",
        "[The monsoons.] There are two seasons in the Philippines, the wet and\nthe dry. The south-west monsoon brings the rainy season, at the time of\nour summer, to the provinces which lie exposed to the south and west\nwinds. On the northern and eastern coasts the heaviest downpours take\nplace (in our winter months) during the north-eastern monsoons. The\nruggedness of the country and its numerous mountains cause, in\ncertain districts, many variations in these normal meteorological\nconditions. The dry season lasts in Manila from November till June\n(duration of the north-east monsoon); rain prevails during the\nremaining months (duration of the south-west monsoon). The heaviest\nrainfall occurs in September; March and April are frequently free from\nrain. From October to February inclusively the weather is cool and dry\n(prevalence of N.W., N., and N.E. winds); March, April, and May are\nwarm and dry (prevalence of E.N.E., E., and E.S.E. winds); and from\nJune till the end of September it is humid and moderately warm.",
        "There has been an observatory for many years past in Manila under\nthe management of the Jesuits. The following is an epitome of the\nyearly meteorological report for 1867, for which I am indebted to\nProfessor Dove:",
        "Barometrical readings.–The average height of the mercury was, in 1867,\n755.5; in 1865, 754.57; and in 1866, 753.37 millimeters.",
        "In 1867 the difference between the highest and lowest barometrical\nreadings was not more than 13.96 millimetres, and would have been\nmuch less if the mercury had not been much depressed by storms in July\nand September. The hourly variations amounted to very few millimeters.",
        "Daily reading of the barometer.–The mercury rises in the early morning\ntill about 9 a.m., it then falls up to 3 or 4 p.m., from then it rises\nagain till 9 p.m., and then again falls till towards day-break. Both\nthe principal atmospheric currents prevalent in Manila exercise\na great influence over the mercury in the barometer; the northern\ncurrent causes it to rise (to an average height of 756 millimeters),\nthe southern causes it to fall (to about 753 millimeters).",

        "Coolest months.–November, December and January, with northerly winds.",
        "Hottest months.–April and May. Their high temperature is caused by\nthe change of monsoon from the north-east to the south-west.

        "Daily variations of the thermometer.–The coolest portion of the day\nis from 6 to 7 a.m.; the heat gradually increases, reaches its maximum\nabout 2 or 3 p.m., and then again gradually decreases. During some\nhours of the night the temperature remains unchanged, but towards\nmorning it falls rapidly.",
        "[Winds.] The direction of the wind is very regular at all seasons\nof the year, even when local causes make it vary a little. In the\ncourse of a twelvemonth the wind goes around the whole compass. In\nJanuary and February north winds prevail; in March and April they blow\nfrom the south-east; and in May, June, July, August, and September,\nfrom the south-west. In the beginning of October they vary between\nsouth-east and south-west, and settle down towards the close of the\nmonth in the north-east, in which quarter they remain tolerably fixed\nduring the two following months. The two changes of monsoon always\ntake place in April and May, and in October. As a rule, the direction\nof both monsoons preserves its equilibrium; but in Manila, which is\nprotected towards the north by a high range of hills, the north-east\nmonsoon is often diverted to the south-east and north-west. The same\ncause gives greater force to the south-west wind.",

Number of rainy days\nin the year, 168. The most continuous and heaviest rain falls from\nJune till the end of October. During this period the rain comes down\nin torrents; in September alone the rainfall amounted to 1.5 meters,\nnearly as much as falls in Berlin in the course of the whole year,\n3,072.8 millimeters of rain fell in the twelve month; but this is\nrather more than the average.",
        "The evaporation only amounted to 2,307.3 millimeters; in ordinary\nyears it is generally about equal to the downfall, taking the early\naverages, not those of single months.",

Although Sr. Barrantes had the best official materials at his\ndisposal, too much value must not be attributed to his figures,\nfor the sources from which he drew them are tainted with errors\nto an extent that can hardly be realized in Europe. For example,\nhe derives the following contradictory statements from his official\nsources:–The population of Cavite is set down as 115,300 and 65,225;\nthat of Mindoro as 45,630, and 23,054; that of Manila as 230,443,\nand 323,683; and that of Capiz as 788,947, and 191,818.",
        "[To Bulacan by steamer.]  My first excursion was to the province of\nBulacan, on the northern shore of the Bay of Manila. A couple of\nhours brought the steamer to the bar of Binuanga (not Bincanga as\nit is called in Coello’s map), and a third to Bulacan, the capital\nof the province, situated on the flat banks of an influent of the\nPampanga delta. I was the only European passenger, the others were\ncomposed of Tagalogs, mestizos, and a few Chinese; the first more\nparticularly were represented by women, who are generally charged with\nthe management of all business affairs, for which they are much better\nfitted than the men. As a consequence, there are usually more women\nthan men seen in the streets, and it appears to be an admitted fact\nthat the female births are more numerous than the male. According,\nhowever, to the church-record which I looked through, the reverse was,\nat any rate in the eastern provinces, formerly the case.",
        "[Carromatas.]  At the landing-place a number of carromatas were waiting\nfor us,–brightly painted, shallow, two-wheeled boxes, provided with\nan awning, and harnessed to a couple of horses, in which strangers\nwith money to spend are quickly driven anywhere they may desire.",
        "[Town of Bulacan.]  The town of Bulacan contains from 11,000 to 12,000\ninhabitants; but a month before my arrival, the whole of it, with the\nexception of the church and a few stone houses, had been burnt to the\nground. All were therefore occupied in building themselves new houses,\nwhich, oddly enough, but very practically, were commenced at the roof,\nlike houses in a drawing. Long rows of roofs composed of palm-leaves\nand bamboos were laid in readiness on the ground, and in the meantime\nwere used as tents.",
        "[Frequence of fires.]  Similar destructive fires are very common. The\nhouses, which with few exceptions are built of bamboo and wood, become\nperfectly parched in the hot season, dried into so much touchwood by\nthe heat of the sun. Their inhabitants are extremely careless about\nfire, and there are no means whatever of extinguishing it. If anything\ncatches fire on a windy day, the entire village, as a rule, is utterly\ndone for. During my stay in Bulacan, the whole suburb of San Miguel,\nin the neighborhood of Manila, was burnt down, with the exception of\nthe house of a Swiss friend of mine, which owed its safety to the\nvigorous use of a private fire-engine, and the intermediation of a\nsmall garden full of bananas, whose stems full of sap stopped the\nprogress of the flames.",
        "[To Calumpit by carriage.]  I travelled to Calumpit, a distance of\nthree leagues, in the handsome carriage of an hospitable friend. The\nroads were good, and were continuously shaded by fruit-trees, coco and\nareca palms. The aspect of this fruitful province reminded me of the\nrichest districts of Java; but the pueblos here exhibited more comfort\nthan the desas there. The houses were more substantial; numerous roomy\nconstructions of wood, in many cases, even, of stone, denoted in every\nisland the residence of official and local magnates. But while even\nthe poorer Javanese always give their wicker huts a smart appearance,\nborder the roads of their villages with blooming hedges, and display\neverywhere a sense of neatness and cleanliness, there were here far\nfewer evidences of taste to be met with. I missed too the alun-alun,\nthat pretty and carefully tended open square, which, shaded by waringa\ntrees, is to be met with in every village in Java. And the quantity\nand variety of the fruit trees, under whose leaves the desas of Java\nare almost hidden, were by no means as great in this province, although\nit is the garden of the Philippines, as in its Dutch prototype.",
        "[Calumpit.]  I reached Calumpit towards evening, just as a procession,\nresplendent with flags and torches, and melodious with song, was\nmarching round the stately church, whose worthy priest, on the strength\nof a letter of introduction from Madrid, gave me a most hospitable\nreception. Calumpit, a prosperous place of 12,250 inhabitants, is\nsituated at the junction of the Quingua and Pampanga rivers, in an\nextremely fruitful plain, fertilized by the frequent overflowing of\nthe two streams.",
        "[Mt. Arayat.]  About six leagues to the north-west of Calumpit,\nMount Arayat, a lofty, isolated, conical hill, lifts its head. Seen\nfrom Calumpit, its western slope meets the horizon at an angle of 20°,\nits eastern at one of 25°; and the profile of its summit has a gentle\ninclination of from 4° to 5°.",
        "[Picking fish.]  At Calumpit I saw some Chinese catching fish in a\npeculiar fashion. Across the lower end of the bed of a brook which\nwas nearly dried up, and in which there were only a few rivulets\nleft running, they had fastened a hurdle of bamboo, and thrown up a\nshallow dam behind it. The water which collected was thrown over the\ndam with a long-handled winnowing shovel. The shovel was tied to a\nbamboo frame work ten feet high, the elasticity of which made the\nwork much easier. As soon as the pool was emptied, the fisherman\nwas easily able to pick out of the mud a quantity of small fish\n(Ophiocephalus vagus). These fishes, which are provided with peculiar\norganisms to facilitate respiration, at any rate, enabling them to\nremain for some considerable time on dry land, are in the wet season\nso numerous in the ditches, ponds, and rice-fields, that they can\nbe killed with a stick. When the water sinks they also retire, or,\naccording to Professor Semper, bore deeply into the ooze at the bottom\nof the watercourses, where, protected by a hard crust of earth from\nthe persecutions of mankind, they sleep away the winter. This Chinese\nmethod of fishing seems well adapted to the habits of the fish. The\ncircumstances that the dam is only constructed at the lower end of\nthe watercourse, and that it is there that the fish are to be met\nwith in the greatest numbers, seem to indicate that they can travel\nin the ooze, and that as the brooks and ditches get dried up, they\nseek the larger water channels.",
        "[To Baliwag.]  Following the Quingua in its upward and eastward\ncourse as it meandered through a well-cultivated and luxuriantly\nfertile country, past stone-built churches and chapels which grouped\nthemselves with the surrounding palm-trees and bamboo-bushes into\nsylvan vignettes, Father Llano’s four-horsed carriage brought me to\nthe important town of Baliwag, the industry of which is celebrated\nbeyond the limits of the province.",
        "[Board houses and their furniture.]  I visited several families and\nreceived a friendly reception from all of them. The houses were built\nof boards and were placed upon piles elevated five feet above the\nground. Each consisted of a spacious dwelling apartment which opened on\none side into the kitchen, and on the other on to an open space, the\nazotea; a lofty roof of palm-trees spread itself above the dwelling,\nthe entrance to which was through the azotea. The latter was half\ncovered by the roof I have just mentioned. The floor was composed\nof slats an inch in width, laid half that distance apart. Chairs,\ntables, benches, a cupboard, a few small ornaments, a mirror, and some\nlithographs in frames, composed the furniture of the interior. The\ncleanliness of the house and the arrangement of its contents testified\nto the existence of order and prosperity.",
        "[Tapis weaving.]  I found the women in almost all the houses occupied\nin weaving tapis, which have a great reputation in the Manila\nmarket. They are narrow, thickly-woven silk scarves, six varas in\nlength, with oblique white stripes on a dark-brown ground. They are\nworn above the sarong.",
        "[Petaca cigar cases.]  Baliwag is also especially famous for its\npetaca [60]cigar-cases, which surpass all others in delicacy of\nworkmanship. They are not made of straw, but of fine strips of Spanish\ncane, and particularly from the lower ends of the leaf-stalks of the\ncalamusart, which is said to grow only in the province of Nueva Ecija.",
        "[Preparation of material.]  A bundle of a hundred selected stalks,\na couple of feet long, costs about six reals. When these stalks have\nbeen split lengthways into four or five pieces, the inner wood is\nremoved, till nothing but the outer part remains. The thin strips\nthus obtained are drawn by the hand between a convex block and a\nknife fixed in a sloping position, and between a couple of steel\nblades which nearly meet.",
        "[Costly weaving.]  It is a task requiring much patience and\npractice. In the first operation, as a rule, quite one-half of the\nstems are broken, and in the second more than half, so that scarcely\ntwenty per cent of the stalks survive the final process. In very fine\nmatting the proportionate loss is still greater. The plaiting is done\non wooden cylinders. A case of average workmanship, which costs two\ndollars on the spot, can be manufactured in six days’ uninterrupted\nlabor. Cigar-cases of exceptionally intricate workmanship, made to\norder for a connoisseur, frequently cost upwards of fifty dollars.",
        "[Volcanic stone quarries.]  Following the Quingua from Baliwag up its\nstream, we passed several quarries, where we saw the thickly-packed\nstrata of volcanic stone which is used as a building material. The\nbanks of the river are thickly studded with prickly bamboos from\nten to twelve feet high. The water overflows in the rainy season,\nand floods the plain for a great distance. Hence the many shells of\nlarge freshwater mussels which are to be seen lying on the earth which\ncovers the volcanic deposit. The country begins to get hilly in the\nneighborhood of Tobog, a small place with no church of its own, and\ndependent for its services upon the priest of the next parish. The\ngentle slopes of the hills are, as in Java, cut into terraces and\nused for the cultivation of rice. Except at Lucban I have never\nobserved similar sawas anywhere else in the Philippines. Several small\nsugar-fields, which, however, the people do not as yet understand\nhow to manage properly, show that the rudiments of agricultural\nprosperity are already in existence. The roads are partly covered\nwith awnings, beneath which benches are placed affording repose to\nthe weary traveller. I never saw these out of this province. One\nmight fancy oneself in one of the most fertile and thickly-populated\ndistricts of Java.",
        "[A convento and the parish priest.] I passed the night in a convento,\nas the dwelling of the parish priest is called in the Philippines. It\nwas extremely dirty, and the priest, an Augustinian, was full of\nproselytish ardor. I had to undergo a long geographical examination\nabout the difference between Prussia and Russia; was asked whether\nthe great city of Nuremberg was the capital of the grand-duchy or of\nthe empire of Russia; learnt that the English were on the point of\nreturning to the bosom of the Catholic Church, and that the “others\"\nwould soon follow, and was, in short, in spite of the particular\nrecommendation of Father Llanos, very badly received. Some little time\nafterwards I fell into the hands of two young Capuchins, who tried to\nconvert me, but who, with the exception of this little impertinence,\ntreated me capitally. They gave me pâtés de foie gras boiled in water,\nwhich I quickly recognized by the truffles swimming about in the\ngrease. To punish them for their importunity I refrained from telling\nmy hosts the right way to cook the pâtés, which I had the pleasure of\nafterwards eating in the forest, as I easily persuaded them to sell\nme the tins they had left. These are the only two occasions on which\nI was subjected to this kind of annoyance during my eighteen months’\nresidence in the Philippines.",
        "[Arrangements for travellers.] The traveller who is provided\nwith a passport is, however, by no means obliged to rely upon\npriestly hospitality, as he needs must do in many isolated parts of\nEurope. Every village, every hamlet, has its commonhouse, called casa\nreal or tribunal, in which he can take up his quarters and be supplied\nwith provisions at the market price, a circumstance that I was not\nacquainted with on the occasion of my first trip. The traveller is\ntherefore in this respect perfectly independent, at least in theory,\nthough in practice he will often scarcely be able to avoid putting\nup at the conventos in the more isolated parts of the country. In\nthese the priest, perhaps the only white man for miles around, is\nwith difficulty persuaded to miss the opportunity of housing such\na rare guest, to whom he is only too anxious to give up the best\nbedroom in his dwelling, and to offer everything that his kitchen\nand cellar can afford. Everything is placed before the guest in such\na spirit of sincere and undisguised friendliness, that he feels no\nobligation, but on the contrary easily persuades himself that he is\ndoing his host a favor by prolonging his stay. Upon one occasion,\nwhen I had determined, in spite of an invitation from the padre,\nto occupy the casa real, just as I was beginning to instal myself,\nthe priest appeared upon the scene with the municipal officials and a\nband of music which was in the neighborhood pending the preparations\nfor a religious festival. He made them lift me up, chair and all,\nand with music and general rejoicing carried me off to his own house.",
        "[Kupang iron-foundry.] On the following day I paid a visit to Kupang,\nan iron-foundry lying to the N.N.E of Angat, escorted by two armed\nmen, whose services I was pressed to accept, as the district had a bad\nreputation for robberies. After travelling three or four miles in a\nnortherly direction, we crossed the Banauon, at that time a mere brook\nmeandering through shingle, but in the rainy season an impetuous stream\nmore than a hundred feet broad; and in a couple of hours we reached the\niron-works, an immense shed lying in the middle of the forest, with\na couple of wings at each end, in which the manager, an Englishman,\nwho had been wrecked some years before in Samar, lived with his wife,\na pretty mestiza. If I laid down my handkerchief, my pencil, or any\nother object, the wife immediately locked them up to protect them from\nthe kleptomania of her servants. These poor people, whose enterprise\nwas not a very successful one, had to lead a wretched life. Two years\nbefore my visit a band of twenty-seven robbers burst into the place,\nsacked the house, and threw its mistress, who was alone with her\nmaid at the time, out of the window. She fortunately alighted without\nreceiving any serious hurt, but the maid, whom terror caused to jump\nout of the window also, died of the injuries she received. The robbers,\nwho turned out to be miners and residents in Angat, were easily caught,\nand, when I was there, had already spent a couple of years in prison\nawaiting their trial.",
        "[A negrito family.] I met a negrito family here who had friendly\nrelations with the people in the iron-works, and were in the habit\nof exchanging the produce of the forest with them for provisions. The\nfather of this family accompanied me on a hunting expedition. He was\narmed with a bow and a couple of arrows. The arrows had spear-shaped\niron points a couple of inches long; one of them had been dipped\ninto arrow-poison, a mixture that looked like black tar. The women\nhad guitars (tabaua) similar to those used by the Mintras in the\nMalay peninsula. They were made of pieces of bamboo a foot long,\nto which strings of split chair-cane were fastened. [61]",
        "[Unwelcome hospitality.] Upon my return, to avoid spending the night\nat the wretched convento where I had left my servant with my luggage,\nI took the advice of my friends at the iron-works and started late,\nin order to arrive at the priest’s after ten o’clock at night; for\nI knew that the padre shut up his house at ten, and that I could\ntherefore sleep, without offending him, beneath the roof of a wealthy\nmestizo, an acquaintance of theirs. About half-past ten I reached\nthe latter’s house, and sat down to table with the merry women of\nthe family, who were just having their supper. Suddenly my friend the\nparson made his appearance from an inner room, where with a couple of\nAugustinian friars, he had been playing cards with the master of the\nhouse. He immediately began to compliment me upon my good fortune,\n\"for had you been but one minute later,” said he, “you certainly\nwouldn’t have got into the convento.”",
        "[The Lagoon of Bay.] My second trip took me up the Pasig to the great\nLagoon of Bay. I left Manila at night in a banca, a boat hollowed out\nof a tree-trunk, with a vaulted roof made of bamboo and so low that it\nwas almost impossible to sit upright under it, which posture, indeed,\nthe banca-builder appeared to have neglected to consider. A bamboo\nhurdle placed at the bottom of the boat protects the traveller from\nthe water and serves him as a couch. Jurien de la Gravière [62]\ncompares the banca to a cigar-box, in which the traveller is so\ntightly packed that he would have little chance of saving his life\nif it happened to upset. The crew was composed of four rowers and\na helmsman; their daily pay was five reals apiece, in all nearly\nseven pesos, high wages for such lazy fellows in comparison with\nthe price of provisions, for the rice that a hard-working man ate in\na day seldom cost more than seven centavos (in the provinces often\nscarcely six), and the rest of his food (fish and vegetables), only\none centavo. We passed several villages and tiendas on the banks in\nwhich food was exposed for sale. My crew, after trying to interrupt\nthe journey under all sorts of pretences, left the boat as we came to\na village, saying that they were going to fetch some sails; but they\nforgot to return. At last, with the assistance of the night watchman\nI succeeded in hauling them out of some of their friends’ houses,\nwhere they had concealed themselves. After running aground several\ntimes upon the sandbanks, we entered the land and hill-locked Lagoon\nof Bay, and reached Jalajala early in the morning.",
        "[The Pasig.] The Pasig forms a natural canal, about six leagues long,\nbetween the Bay of Manila and the Lagoon of Bay, a fresh water lake,\nthirty-five leagues in circumference, that washes the shores of three\nfertile provinces, Manila, Laguna and Cavite. Formerly large vessels\nfull of cargo used to be able to sail right up to the borders of the\nlake; now they are prevented by sandbanks. Even flat-bottomed boats\nfrequently run aground on the Napindan and Taguig banks. [63] Were\nthe banks removed, and the stone bridge joining Manila to Binondo\nreplaced by a swing bridge, or a canal made round it, the coasting\nvessels would be able to ship the produce of the lagoon provinces\nat the very foot of the fields in which they grow. The traffic would\nbe very profitable, the waters would shrink, and the shallows along\nthe shore might be turned into rice and sugar fields. A scheme of\nthis kind was approved more than thirty years ago in Madrid, but it\nwas never carried into execution. The sanding up of the river has,\non the contrary, been increased by a quantity of fish reels, the\nerection of which has been favored by the Colonial Waterways Board\nbecause it reaped a small tax from them.",
        "[A famous plantation.] Jalajala, an estate which occupies the eastern\nof the two peninsulas which run southward into the lake, is one of\nthe first places visited by strangers. It owes this preference to\nits beautiful position and nearness to Manila, and to the fantastic\ndescription of it by a former owner, De la Gironnière. The soil\nof the peninsula is volcanic; its range of hills is very rugged,\nand the watercourses bring down annually a quantity of soil from the\nmountains, which increases the deposits at their base. The shore-line,\novergrown with grass and prickly sensitive-plants quite eight feet\nhigh, makes capital pasture for carabaos. Behind it broad fields of\nrice and sugar extend themselves up to the base of the hills. Towards\nthe north the estate is bounded by the thickly-wooded Sembrano,\nthe highest mountain in the peninsula; on the remaining sides it\nis surrounded with water. With the exception of the flat shore, the\nwhole place is hilly and overgrown with grass and clumps of trees,\ncapital pasture for its numerous herds–a thousand carabaos, one\nthousand five hundred to two thousand bullocks, and from six to seven\nhundred nearly wild horses. As we were descending one of the hills,\nwe were suddenly surrounded by half-a-dozen armed men, who took us\nfor cattle-thieves, but who, to their disappointment, were obliged\nto forego their expected chance of a reward.",
        "[Los Baños hot springs.] Beyond Jalajala, on the south coast of\nthe Lagoon of Bay, lies the hamlet of Los Baños, so called from a\nhot spring at the foot of the Makiling volcano. Even prior to the\narrival of the Spaniards, the natives used its waters as a remedy,\n[64] but they are now very little patronized. The shore of the lake is\nat this point, and indeed all round its circumference, so flat that it\nis impossible to land with dry feet from the shallowest canoe. It is\nquite covered with sand mussels. North-west of Los Baños there lies\na small volcanic lake fringed with thick woods, called Dagatan (the\nenchanted lagoon of travellers), to distinguish it from Dagât, as the\nTagals call the great Lagoon of Bay. I saw nothing of the crocodiles\nwhich are supposed to infest it, but we flushed several flocks of wild\nfowl, disturbed by our invasion of their solitude. From Los Baños I had\nintended to go to Lupang Puti (white earth), where, judging from the\nsamples shown me, there is a deposit of fine white silicious earth,\nwhich is purified in Manila and used as paint. I did not reach the\nplace, as the guide whom I had with difficulty obtained, pretended,\nafter a couple of miles, to be dead beat. From the inquiries I made,\nhowever, I apprehend that it is a kind of solfatara. Several deposits\nof it appear to exist at the foot of the Makiling. [65]",
        "[Talim island.] On my return I paid a visit to the Island of\nTalim, which, with the exception of a clearing occupied by a few\nmiserable huts, is uninhabited and thickly overgrown with forest and\nundergrowth. In the center of the Island is the Susong-Dalaga (maiden’s\nbosom), a dolerite hill with a beautifully formed crest. Upon the\nshore, on a bare rock, I found four eggs containing fully developed\nyoung crocodiles. When I broke the shells the little reptiles made off.",
        "[M. de la Gironnière.] Although the south-west monsoons generally occur\nlater in Jalajala than in Manila, it was already raining so hard that\nI decided to go to Calauan, on the southern shore of the lake, which\nis protected by Mount Makiling, and does not experience the effect of\nthe rainy monsoons till later in the season. I met M. de la Gironnière\nin Calauan, the “gentilhomme Breton” who is so well known for telling\nthe most terrible adventures. He had lately returned from Europe to\nestablish a large sugar manufactory. His enterprise, however, was a\nfailure. The house of the lively old gentleman, whose eccentricity\nhad led him to adopt the dress and the frugal habits of the natives,\nwas neither clean or well kept, although he had a couple of friends\nto assist him in the business, a Scotchman, and a young Frenchman\nwho had lived in the most refined Parisian society.",
        "[Llanura de Imuc.] There were several small lakes and a few empty\nvolcanic basins on the estate. To the south-west, not very far\nfrom the house, and to the left of the road leading to San Pablo,\nlies the Llanura de Imuc, a valley of dolerite more than a hundred\nfeet deep. Large blocks of basalt enable one to climb down into the\nvalley, the bottom of which is covered with dense growths. The center\nof the basin is occupied by a neglected coffee plantation laid out\nby a former proprietor. The density of the vegetation prevented my\ntaking more precise observations. There is another shallower volcanic\ncrater to the north of it. Its soil was marshy and covered with cane\nand grass, but even in the rainy season it does not collect sufficient\nwater to turn it into a lake. It might, therefore, be easily drained\nand cultivated. To the south-west of this basin, and to the right\nof the road to San Pablo, lies the [Tigui-mere.] Tigui-mere. From a\nplain of whitish-grey soil, covered with concentric shells as large\nas a nut, rises a circular embankment with gently-sloping sides,\nintersected only by a small cleft which serves as an entrance, and\nwhich shows, on its edges denuded of vegetation, the loose rapilli of\nwhich the embankment is formed. The sides of this natural amphitheatre\ntower more than a hundred feet above its flat base. A path runs east\nand west right through the center. The northern half is studded with\ncocopalm trees and cultivated plants; the southern portion is full of\nwater nearly covered with green weeds and slime. The ground consists\nof black rapilli.",
        "[Leaf imprints in lava.]  From the Tigui-mere I returned to the\nhacienda a bank formed of volcanic lava two feet in thickness\nand covered with indistinct impressions of leaves. Their state of\npreservation did not allow me to distinguish their species, but they\ncertainly belonged to some tropical genus, and are, according to\nProfessor A. Braun, of the same kind as those now growing there.",
        "There are two more small lakes half a league to the south-east. The\nroad leading to them is composed of volcanic remains which cover the\nsoil, and large blocks of lava lie in the bed of the stream.",
        "[Maycap Lake.]  The first of the two, the Maycap Lake, is entirely\nembanked with the exception of a small opening fitted with sluices\nto supply water to a canal; and from its northern side, which alone\nadmits of an open view, the southern peak of San Cristobal may\nbe seen, about 73° to the north-east. Its banks, which are about\neighty feet high, rise with a gentle slope in a westerly direction,\ntill they join Mount Maiba, a hill about 500 feet high. The soil,\nlike that of the embankments of the other volcanic lakes, consists\nof rapilli and lava, and is thickly wooded.",
        "[Lake Palakpakan.]  Close by is another lake, Palakpakan, of nearly\nthe same circumference, and formed in a similar manner (of black\nsand and rapilli). Its banks are from thirty to one hundred feet\nhigh. From its north-western edge San Cristobal lifts its head 70° to\nthe northeast. Its waters are easily reached, and are much frequented\nby fishermen.",
        "[Palm brandy.]  About nine o’clock, a.m., I rode from Calauan to Pila,\nand thence in a northeasterly direction to Santa Cruz, over even,\nbroad, and well-kept roads, through a palm-grove a mile long and a\nmile and a half broad, which extends down to the very edge of the\nlagoons. The products of these palm trees generally are not used\nfor the production of oil but for the manufacture of brandy. Their\nfruit is not allowed to come to maturity; but the buds are slit open,\nand the sweet sap is collected  as it drips from them. It is then\nallowed to ferment, and subjected to distillation. [66] As the sap\nis collected twice a day, and as the blossoms, situated at the top\nof the tree, are forty or fifty feet above the ground, bamboos are\nfastened horizontally, one above the other, from one tree to another,\nto facilitate the necessary ascent and descent. The sap collector\nstands on the lower cross-piece while he holds on to the upper.",
        "[Bought by government.] The sale of palm-brandy was at the time of my\nvisit the monopoly of the government, which retailed it in the Estanco\n(government sale rooms) with cigars, stamped paper, and religious\nindulgences. The manufacture was carried on by private individuals;\nbut the whole of the brandy was of necessity disposed of to the\nadministration, which, however, paid such a high price for it that\nthe contractors made large profits.",
        "[Profit in manufacture.] I afterwards met a Spaniard in Camarines who,\naccording to his own account, must have made considerable and easy\ngains from these contracts. He had bought palm-trees at an average\nprice of five reals apiece (they usually cost more, though they can\nbe sometimes purchased for two reals). Thirty-five palms will furnish\ndaily at least thirty-six quarts of tuba (sugar-containing sap), from\nwhich, after fermentation and distillation, six quarts of brandy of\nthe prescribed strength can be manufactured. One man is sufficient to\nattend to them, and receives for his trouble half the proceeds. The\nadministration pays six cuartos for a quart of brandy. My friend the\ncontractor was in annual receipt, therefore, from every thirty-five\nof his trees, of 360 × 1/2 × 5 cuartos = $40.50. As the thirty-five\ntrees only cost him $21.875, his invested capital brought him in\nabout 200 per cent.",
        "[Wine and liquor monopoly a failure.]  The proceeds of this monopoly\n(wines and liquors) were rated at $1,622,810 in the colonial budget for\n1861; but its collection was so difficult, and so disproportionately\nexpensive, that it nearly swallowed up the whole profit. It caused\nespionage, robberies of all sorts, embezzlement, and bribery on a\nlarge scale. The retail of the brandy by officials, who are paid by a\npercentage on the consumption, did a good deal to injure the popular\nrespect for the government. Moreover, the imposition of this improper\ntax on the most important industry of the country not only crippled\nthe free trade in palms, but also the manufacture of raw sugar;\nfor the government, to favor their own monopoly, had forbidden the\nsugar manufacturers to make rum from their molasses, which became\nin consequence so valueless that in Manila they gave it to their\nhorses. The complaints of the manufacturers at last stirred up the\nadministration to allow the manufacture of rum; but the palm-brandy\nmonopoly remained intact. The Filipinos now drank nothing but rum,\nso that at last, in self-defence, the government entirely abandoned\nthe monopoly (January, 1864). Since that, the rum manufacturers pay\ntaxes according to the amount of their sale, but not upon the amount\nof their raw produce. In order to cover the deficit occasioned by\nthe abandonment of the brandy monopoly, the government has made a\nsmall increase in the poll-tax. The practice of drinking brandy has\nnaturally much increased; it is, however, a very old habit. [67] With\nthis exception, the measure has had the most favorable consequences.",
        "[Santa Cruz.]  Santa Cruz is a lively, prosperous place (in 1865 it\ncontained 11,385 inhabitants), through the center of which runs a\nriver. As the day on which we passed through it was Sunday, the stream\nwas full of bathers, amongst them several women, their luxuriant hair\ncovered with broad-brimmed hats to shade them from the sun. From the\nford the road takes a sharp turn and inclines first to the east and\nthen to the south-east, till it reaches Magdalena, between which and\nMajaijai the country becomes hilly. Just outside the latter, a viaduct\ntakes the road across a deep ravine full of magnificent ferns, which\nremind the traveller of the height–more than 600 feet–above the sea\nlevel to which he has attained. The spacious convento at Majaijai,\nbuilt by the Jesuits, is celebrated for its splendid situation. The\nLagoon of Bay is seen to extend far to the north-east; in the distance\nthe Peninsula of Jalajala and the Island of Talim, from which rises\nthe Susong-Dalaga volcano, terminate the vista. From the convento to\nthe lake stretches an endless grove of coco-trees, while towards the\nsouth the slope of the distant high ground grows suddenly steeper,\nand forms an abruptly precipitous conical hill, intersected by deep\nravines. This is the Banajao or Majaijai volcano, and beside it Mount\nSan Cristobal rears its bell-shaped summit.",
        "[Scenery along Lucban-Maubon road.] As everybody was occupied with\nthe preparations for an ensuing religious festival, I betook myself,\nthrough Lucban on the eastern shore, to Mauban, situated amidst\ndeep ravines and masses of lava at the foot of Mount Majaijai. The\nvegetation was of indescribable beauty, and the miserable road\nwas enlivened with cheerful knots of pedestrians hastening to the\nfestival. [68]",
        "[Lucban.] I reached Lucban in three hours; it is a prosperous place\nof 13,000 inhabitants, to the north-east of Majaijai. A year after my\nvisit it burnt to the ground. The agricultural produce of the district\nis not very important, owing to the mountainous nature of the country;\nbut considerable industrial activity prevails there. The inhabitants\nweave fine straw hats from the fibre of the leaf of the buri palm-tree\n(corypha sp.), manufacture pandanus mats, and carry on a profitable\ntrade at Mauban with the placer miners of North Camarines. The entire\nbreadth of the road is covered with cement, and along its center flows,\nin an open channel, a sparkling rivulet.",
        "[Java-like rice fields.] The road from Lucban to Mauban, which is\nsituated on the bay of Lamon, opposite to the Island of Alabat, winds\nalong the narrow watercourse of the Mapon river, through deep ravines\nwith perpendicular cliffs of clay. I observed several terrace-formed\nrice-fields similar to those so prevalent in Java, an infrequent\nsight in the Philippines. Presently the path led us into the very\nthick of the forest. Nearly all the trees were covered with aroides\nand creeping ferns; amongst them I noticed the angiopteris, pandanus,\nand several large specimens of the fan palm.",
        "[Mapon river.]  Three leagues from Lucban the river flows under a rock\nsupported on prismatically shaped pillars, and then runs through a\nbed of round pebbles, composed of volcanic stone and white lime, as\nhard as marble, in which impressions of shell-fish and coral can be\ntraced. Further up the river the volcanic rubble disappears, and the\ncontaining strata then consist of the marble-like pebbles cemented\ntogether with calcareous spar. These strata alternate with banks of\nclay and coarse-grained soil, which contain scanty and badly preserved\nimprints of leaves and mussel-fish. Amongst them, however, I observed\na flattened but still recognizable specimen of the fossil melania. The\nriver-bed must be quite five hundred feet above the level of the sea.",
        "[Bamboo raft ferry.] About a league beyond Mauban, as it was getting\ndusk, we crossed the river, then tolerably broad, on a wretched leaking\nbamboo raft, which sank at least six inches beneath the water under\nthe weight of our horses, and ran helplessly aground in the mud on\nthe opposite side.",
        "[Visitors to festival.] The tribunal or common-house was crowded with\npeople who had come to attend the festival which was to take place\non the following day. The cabezas wore, in token of their dignity,\na short jacket above their shirts. A quantity of brightly decorated\ntables laden with fruit and pastry stood against the walls, and in\nthe middle of the principal room a dining-table was laid out for\nforty persons.",
        "[Hospitality of tribunal.] A European who travels without a\nservant–mine had run away with some wages I had rashly paid\nhim in advance–is put down as a beggar, and I was overwhelmed\nwith impertinent questions on the subject, which, however, I left\nunanswered. As I hadn’t had the supper I stood considerably in need of,\nI took the liberty of taking a few savory morsels from the meatpot,\nwhich I ate in the midst of a little knot of wondering spectators;\nI then laid myself down to sleep on the bench beside the table, to\nwhich a second set of diners were already sitting down. When I awoke\non the following morning there were already so many people stirring\nthat I had no opportunity of performing my toilet. I therefore betook\nmyself in my dirty travelling dress to the residence of a Spaniard who\nhad settled in the pueblo, and who received me in the most hospitable\nmanner as soon as the description in my passport satisfied him that\nI was worthy of a confidence not inspired by my appearance.",
        "[Trade in molaze.] My friendly host carried on no trifling\nbusiness. Two English ships were at that moment in the harbor, which\nhe was about to send to China laden with molave, a species of wood\nakin to teak.",
        "[Butucan waterfall.] On my return I visited the fine waterfall of\nButucan, between Mauban and Lucban, a little apart from the high\nroad. A powerful stream flows between two high banks of rocky\nsoil thickly covered with vegetation, and, leaping from a ledge\nof volcanic rock suddenly plunges into a ravine, said to be three\nhundred and sixty feet in depth, along the bottom of which it is\nhurried away. The channel, however, is so narrow, and the vegetation\nso dense, that an observer looking at it from above can not follow\nits course. This waterfall has a great similarity to that which falls\nfrom the Semeru in Java. Here, as there, a volcanic stream flowing over\nvast rocky deposits forms a horizontal watercourse, which in its turn\nis overshadowed with immense masses of rock. The water easily forces\nits way between these till it reaches the solid lava, when it leaves\nits high, narrow, and thickly-wooded banks, and plunges into the deep\nchasm it has itself worn away. The pouring rain unfortunately prevented\nme from sketching this fine fall. It was raining when I reached the\nconvento of Majaijai, and it was still raining when I left it three\ndays later, nor was there any hope of improvement in the weather for\nanother month to come. “The wet season lasts for eight or nine months\nin Majaijai, and during the whole period scarcely a day passes without\nthe rain falling in torrents.\"–Estado geograph.",
        "[Majaijai.] To ascend the volcano was under such circumstances\nimpracticable. According to some notes written by the Majaijai\npriest, an ascent and survey of Mount Banajao was made on the 22nd\nof April, 1858, by Senors Roldan and Montero, two able Spanish naval\nofficers, specially charged with the revision of the marine chart\nof the archipelago. From its summit they took observations of Manila\ncathedral, of Mayon, another volcano in Albay, and of the Island of\nPolillo. They estimated the altitude of Banajao to be seven thousand\nand twenty Spanish feet, and the depth of its crater to be seven\nhundred. The crater formerly contained a lake, but the last eruption\nmade a chasm in its southern side through which the water flowed\naway. [69]",
        "[Calauan.] I reached Calauan in the pouring rain, wading through the\nsoft spongy clay upon wretched, half-starved ponies, and found I must\nput off my water journey to Manila till the following day, as there\nwas no boat on the lake at this point. The next morning there were no\nhorses to be found; and it was not till the afternoon that I procured\na cart and a couple of carabaos to take me to Santa Cruz, whence in the\nevening the market-vessel started for Manila. One carabao was harnessed\nin front; the other was fastened behind the cart in order that I might\nhave a change of animals when the first became tired. Carabao number\none wouldn’t draw, and number two acted as a drag–rather useless\napparatus on a level road–so I changed them. As soon as number two\nfelt the load it laid down. A few blows persuaded it to pick itself up,\nwhen it deliberately walked to the nearest pool and dropped into it. It\nwas with the greatest trouble that we unharnessed the cart and pushed\nit back on to the road, while our two considerate beasts took a mud\nbath. At last we reloaded the baggage, the carabaos were reharnessed in\nthe original positions, and the driver, leaning his whole weight upon\nthe nose-rope of the leading beast, pulled with might and main. To my\ngreat delight the animal condescended to slowly advance with the cart\nand its contents. [Pila.] At Pila I managed to get a better team, with\nwhich late in the evening, in the midst of a pouring rain, I reached\na little hamlet opposite Santa Cruz. The market-vessel had left; our\nattempts to get a boat to take us across to the village only led to\nbarefaced attempts at extortion, so I entered one of the largest of the\nhamlet’s houses, which was occupied by a widow and her daughter. After\nsome delay my request for a night’s lodging was granted. I sent for\nsome oil, to give me a little light, and something to eat. The women\nbrought in some of their relations, who helped to prepare the food\nand stopped in the house to protect its owners. The next morning\nI crossed the river, teeming with joyous bathers, to Santa Cruz,\nand hired a boat there to take me across the lake to Pasig, and from\nthence to Manila. A contrary wind, however, forced us to land on the\npromontory of Jalajala, and there wait for the calm that accompanies\nthe dawn. [Earthquake evidences.] Betwixt the extreme southern point\nof the land and the houses I saw, in several places, banks of mussels\nprojecting at least fifteen feet above the surface of the water,\nsimilar to those which are so frequently found on the sea-coast;–a\nproof that earthquakes have taken place in this neighborhood.",
        "[To Albay by schooner.] Towards the end of August I started from\nManila for Albay in a schooner which had brought a cargo of hemp and\nwas returning in ballast. It was fine when we set sail; but on the\nfollowing day the signs of a coming storm increased so rapidly that\nthe captain resolved to return and seek protection in the small but\nsecure harbor of Mariveles, a creek on the southern shore of Bataan,\nthe province forming the western boundary of Manila bay. We reached\nit about two o’clock in the night after cruising about for fourteen\nhours before the entrance; and we were obliged to remain here at anchor\nfor a fortnight, as it rained and stormed continuously for that period.",
        "[Mariveles.] The weather obliged me to limit my excursions to the\nimmediate neighborhood of Mariveles. Unfortunately it was not till the\nclose of our stay that I learnt that there was a colony of negritos in\nthe mountains; and it was not till just before my departure that I got\na chance of seeing and sketching a couple of them, male and female. The\ninhabitants of Mariveles have not a very good reputation. The place\nis only visited by ships which run in there in bad weather, when\ntheir idle crews spend the time in drinking and gambling. Some of\nthe young girls were of striking beauty and of quite a light color;\noften being in reality of mixed race, though they passed as of pure\nTagal blood. This is a circumstance I have observed in many seaports,\nand in the neighborhood of Manila; but, in the districts which are\nalmost entirely unvisited by the Spaniards, the natives are much\ndarker and of purer race.",
        "[Storm-bound shipping.] The number of ships which were seeking\nprotection from the weather in this port amounted to ten, of which\nthree were schooners. Every morning regularly a small pontin [70]\nused to attempt to set sail; but it scarcely got a look at the\nopen sea before it returned, when it was saluted with the jeers and\nlaughter of the others. It was hunger that made them so bold. The\ncrew, who had taken some of their own produce to Manila, had spent\nthe proceeds of their venture, and had started on their return voyage\nscantily provided with provisions, with the hope and intention of soon\nreaching their home, which they could have done with any favorable\nwind. Such cases frequently occur. A few natives unite to charter\na small vessel, and load it with the produce of their own fields,\nwhich they set off to sell in Manila.",
        "[The straits.] The straits between the Islands resemble beautiful\nwide rivers with charming spots upon the banks inhabited by small\ncolonies; and the sailors generally find the weather gets squally\ntowards evening, and anchor till the morning breaks.",
        "[Filipino hospitality.] The hospitable coast supplies them with fish,\ncrabs, plenty of mussels, and frequently unprotected coconuts. If it\nis inhabited, so much the better. Filipino hospitality is ample, and\nmuch more comprehensive than that practised in Europe. The crews are\naccommodated in the different huts. After a repast shared in common,\nand washed down by copious draughts of palm-wine, mats are streched\non the floor; the lamps–large shells, fitted with rush wicks–are\nextinguished, and the occupants of the hut fall asleep together. Once,\nas I was sailing into the bay of Manila after a five day’s cruise, we\novertook a craft which had sailed from the same port as we had with a\ncargo of coconut oil for Manila, and which had spent six months upon\nits trip. It is by no means uncommon for a crew which makes a long\nstay in the capital to squander the whole proceeds of their cargo,\nif they have not done it before reaching town.",
        "[Coasting Luzon.] At last one evening, when the storm had quite passed\naway, we sailed out of Mariveles. A small, volcanic, pillar-shaped\nrock, bearing a striking resemblance to the Island of the Cyclops,\noff the coast of Sicily, lies in front of the harbor–like there, a\nsharp pyramid and a small, flat island. We sailed along the coast of\nCavite till we reached Point Santiago, the southwestern extremity of\nLuzon, and then turned to the east, through the fine straits that lie\nbetween Luzon to the north and the Bisayan islands to the south. As\nthe sun rose, a beautiful spectacle presented itself. To the north\nwas the peak of the Taal volcano, towering above the flat plains of\nBatangas; and to the south the thickly-wooded, but rock-bound coast\nof Mindoro, the iron line of which was broken by the harbor of Porto\nGalera, protected from the fury of the waves by a small islet lying\nimmediately before it. The waters around us were thickly studded with\nvessels which had taken refuge from the storm in the Bisayan ports,\nand were now returning to Manila.",
        "[Importance of straits.] These straits, which extend from the\nsouth-east to the northwest, are the great commercial highway of\nthe Archipelago, and remain navigable during the whole year, being\nprotected from the fury of the north-easterly winds by the sheltering\npeninsula of Luzon, which projects to the south-east, and by Samar,\nwhich extends in a parallel direction; while the Bisayan islands\nshield them from the blasts that blow from the south-west. The\nIslands of Mindoro, Panay, Negros, Cebu and Bohol, which Nature has\nplaced in close succession to each other, form the southern borders\nof the straits; and the narrow cross channels between them form as\nmany outlets to the Sea of Mindoro, which is bounded on the west\nby Palawan, on the east by Mindanao, and on the south by the Sulu\ngroup. The eastern waters of the straits wash the coasts of Samar\nand Leyte, and penetrate through three small channels only to the\ngreat ocean; the narrow straits of San Bernardino, of San Juanico,\nand of Surigao. Several considerable, and innumerable smaller islets,\nlie within the area of these cursorily explained outlines.",
        "[Batangas coast.] A couple of bays on the south coast of Batangas\noffer a road-stead, though but little real protection, to passing\nvessels, which in stormy weather make for Porto Galera, in the Island\nof Mindoro, which lies directly opposite. A river, a league and a\nhalf in length, joins Taal, the principal port of the province, to\nthe great inland sea of Taal, or Bombon. This stream was formerly\nnavigable; but it has now become so sanded up that it is passable\nonly at flood tides, and then only by very small vessels.",
        "[Batangas exports.] The province of Batangas supplies Manila with\nits best cattle, and exports sugar and coffee.",
        "A hilly range bounds the horizon on the Luzon side; the striking\noutlines of which enable one to conjecture its volcanic origin. Most\nof the smaller islands to the south appear to consist of superimposed\nmountainous ranges, terminating seaward in precipitous cliffs. The\nlofty and symmetrical peak of Mount Mayon is the highest point in the\npanoramic landscape. Towards evening we sighted Mount Bulusan, in the\nsouth-eastern extremity of Luzon; and presently we turned northwards,\nand sailed up the Straits of San Bernardino, which separate Luzon\nfrom Samar.",
        "[Bulusan like Vesuvius.] The Bulusan volcano, “which appears to have\nbeen for a long time extinct, but which again began to erupt in 1852,\"\n[71] is surprisingly like Vesuvius in outline. It has, like its\nprototype, a couple of peaks. The western one, a bell-shaped summit,\nis the eruption cone. The eastern apex is a tall, rugged mound,\nprobably the remains of a huge circular crater. As in Vesuvius, the\npresent crater is in the center of the extinct one. The intervals\nbetween them are considerably larger and more uneven than the Atrio\ndel Cavallo of the Italian volcano.",
        "[San Bernardino current.] The current is so powerful in the Straits\nof San Bernardino that we were obliged to anchor twice to avoid\nbeing carried back again. To our left we had continually in view the\nmagnificent Bulusan volcano, with a hamlet of the same name nestling at\nthe foot of its eastern slope in a grove of coco-trees, close to the\nsea. Struggling with difficulty against the force of the current, we\nsucceeded, with the assistance of light and fickle winds, in reaching\nLegaspi, the port of Albay, on the following evening. Our skipper, a\nSpaniard, had determined to accomplish the trip as rapidly as possible.",
        "[A native captain.] On my return voyage, however, I fell into the hands\nof a native captain; and, as my cruise under his auspices presented\nmany peculiarities, I may quote a few passages relating to it from\nmy diary.... The skipper intended to have taken a stock of vegetables\nfor my use, but he had forgotten them. He therefore landed on a small\nisland, and presently made his reappearance with a huge palm cabbage,\nwhich, in the absence of its owner, he had picked from a tree he\ncut down for the purpose.... On another occasion the crew made a\ndescent upon a hamlet on the north-western coast of Leyte to purchase\nprovisions. Instead of laying in a stock for the voyage at Tacloban,\nthe sailors preferred doing so at some smaller village on the shores\nof the straits, where food is cheaper, and where their landing gave\nthem a pretext to run about the country. The straits of San Juanico,\nnever more than a mile, and often only eight hundred feet broad,\nare about twenty miles in length: yet it often takes a vessel a week\nto sail up them; for contrary winds and an adverse current force it\nto anchor frequently and to lie to for whole nights in the narrower\nplaces. Towards evening our captain thought that the sky appeared\nvery threatening, so he made for the bay of Navo, of Masbate. [An\nintermittent voyage.] There he anchored, and a part of the crew went\non shore. The next day was a Sunday; the captain thought “the sky\nstill appeared very threatening;” and besides he wanted to make some\npurchases. So we anchored again off Magdalena, where we passed the\nnight. On Monday a favorable wind took us, at a quicker rate, past\nMarinduque and the rocky islet of Elefante, which lies in front of\nit. Elefante appears to be an extinct volcano; it looks somewhat like\nthe Iriga, but is not so lofty. It is covered with capital pasture,\nand its ravines are dotted with clumps of trees. Nearly a thousand\nhead of half-wild cattle were grazing on it. They cost four dollars\na-piece; and their freight to Manila is as much more, where they sell\nfor sixteen dollars. They are badly tended, and many are stolen by\nthe passing sailors. My friend the captain was full of regret that the\nfavorable wind gave him no opportunity of landing; perhaps I was the\nreal obstacle. “They were splendid beasts! How easy it would be to put\na couple on board! They could scarcely be said to have any real owners;\nthe nominal proprietors were quite unaware how many they possessed,\nand the herd was continually multiplying without any addition from its\nmasters. A man lands with a little money in his pocket. If he meets a\nherdsman, he gives him a dollar, and the poor creature thinks himself\na lucky fellow. If not, so much the better. He can do the business\nhimself; a barrel of shot or a sling suffices to settle the matter.”",
        "[Plunder.] As we sailed along we saw coming towards us another vessel,\nthe Luisa, which suddenly executed a very extraordinary tack; and in a\nminute or two its crew sent up a loud shout of joy, having succeeded\nin stealing a fishbox which the fishermen of Marinduque had sunk in\nthe sea. They had lowered a hook, and been clever enough to grapple\nthe rope of the floating buoy. Our captain was beside himself with\nenvy of their prize.",
        "[Legaspi.] Legaspi is the principal port of the province of Albay. Its\nroad-stead, however, is very unsafe, and, being exposed to the\nnorth-easterly storms, is perfectly useless during the winter. The\nnorth-east wind is the prevailing one on this coast; the south-west\nbreeze only blows in June and July. The heaviest storms occur between\nOctober and January. They generally set in with a gentle westerly wind,\naccompanied with rain. The gale presently veers round to the north\nor the south, and attains the height of its fury when it reaches\nthe north-east or the south-east. After the storm a calm generally\nreigns, succeeded by the usual wind of the prevailing monsoon. The\nlightly-built elastic houses of the country are capitally suited\nto withstand these storms; but roofs and defective houses are\nfrequently carried away. The traffic between Manila and Legaspi is\nat its height between January and October; but during the autumn\nmonths all communication by water ceases. The letter-post, which\narrives pretty regularly every week, is then the only link between\nthe two places. At this season heavy packages can be sent only by\na circuitous and expensive route along the south coast, and thence\nby water to Manila. Much more favorably situated for navigation is\nthe port of [Sorsogon.] Sorsogon, the mouth of which opens to the\nwest, and is protected by the Island of Bagalao, which lies in front\nof it. Besides its security as a harbor, it has the advantage of a\nrapid and unbroken communication with the capital of the archipelago,\nwhile vessels sailing from Legaspi, even at the most favorable time\nof the year, are obliged to go round the eastern peninsula of Luzon,\nand meet the principal current of the Straits of San Bernardino,\nfrequently a very difficult undertaking; and, moreover, small vessels\nobliged to anchor there are in great danger of being captured by\npirates. The country about Sorsogon, however, is not so fertile as\nthe neighborhood of Legaspi.",
        "[A worthy official.] I took letters of introduction with me to both\nthe Spanish authorities of the province; who received me in the most\namiable way, and were of the greatest use to me during the whole of\nmy stay in the vicinity. I had also the good fortune to fall in with\na model alcalde, a man of good family and of most charming manners;\nin short, a genuine caballero. To show the popular appreciation of\nthe honesty of his character, it was said of him in Samar that he\nhad entered the province with nothing but a bundle of papers, and\nhad left it as lightly equipped.",
        "[Daraga.] My Spanish friends enabled me to rent a house in Daraga,\n[72] a well-to-do town of twenty thousand inhabitants at the foot\nof the Mayon, a league and a half from Legaspi. The summit of this\nvolcano was considered inaccessible until two young Scotchmen, Paton\nand Stewart by name, demonstrated the contrary. [73] Since then\nseveral natives have ascended the mountain, but no Europeans.",
        "[Ascent of Mayon.] I set out on September 25th, and passed the night,\nby the advice of Señor Muños, in a hut one thousand feet above the\nlevel of the sea, in order to begin the ascent the next morning with\nunimpaired vigor. But a number of idlers who insisted on following\nme, and who kept up a tremendous noise all night, frustrated the\npurpose of this friendly advice; and I started about five in the\nmorning but little refreshed. The fiery glow I had noticed about the\ncrater disappeared with the dawn. The first few hundred feet of the\nascent were covered with a tall grass quite six feet high; and then\ncame a slope of a thousand feet or so of short grass succeeded by a\nquantity of moss; but even this soon disappeared, and the whole of\nthe upper part of the mountain proved entirely barren. We reached\nthe summit about one o’clock. It was covered with fissures which\ngave out sulphurous gases and steam in such profusion that we were\nobliged to stop our mouths and nostrils with our handkerchiefs to\nprevent ourselves from being suffocated. We came to a halt at the\nedge of a broad and deep chasm, from which issued a particularly\ndense vapor. Apparently we were on the brink of a crater, but the\nthick fumes of the disagreeable vapor made it impossible for us to\nguess at the breadth of the fissure. The absolute top of the volcano\nconsisted of a ridge, nearly ten feet thick, of solid masses of stone\ncovered with a crust of lava bleached by the action of the escaping\ngas. Several irregular blocks of stone lying about us showed that the\npeak had once been a little higher. When, now and again, the gusts\nof wind made rifts in the vapor, we perceived on the northern corner\nof the plateau several rocky columns at least a hundred feet high,\nwhich had hitherto withstood both storm and eruption. I afterwards\nhad an opportunity of observing the summit from Daraga with a capital\ntelescope on a very clear day, when I noticed that the northern side\nof the crater was considerably higher than its southern edge.",
        "[The descent.] Our descent took some time. We had still two-thirds\nof it beneath us when night overtook us. In the hope of reaching\nthe hut where we had left our provisions, we wandered about till\neleven o’clock, hungry and weary, and at last were obliged to wait\nfor daylight. This misfortune was owing not to our want of proper\nprecaution, but to the unreliability of the carriers. Two of them,\nwhom we had taken with us to carry water and refreshments, had\ndisappeared at the very first; and a third, “a very trustworthy\nman,” whom we had left to take care of our things at the hut, and\nwho had been ordered to meet us at dusk with torches, had bolted,\nas I afterwards discovered, back to Daraga before noon. My servant,\ntoo, who was carrying a woolen blanket and an umbrella for me,\nsuddenly vanished in the darkness as soon as it began to rain, and\nthough I repeatedly called him, never turned up again till the next\nmorning. We passed the wet night upon the bare rocks, where, as our\nvery thin clothes were perfectly wet through, we chilled till our\nteeth chattered. As soon, however, as the sun rose we got so warm\nthat we soon recovered our tempers. Towards nine o’clock we reached\nthe hut and got something to eat after twenty-nine hours’ fast.",
        "[A suspicious medal.] In the Trabajos y Hechos Nolables de la\nSoc. Econom. de los Amigos del Pais, for September 4th, 1823, it is\nsaid that “Don Antonio Siguenza paid a visit to the volcano of Albay\non March 11th,” and that the Society “ordered a medal to be struck in\ncommemoration of the event, and in honor of the aforesaid Siguenza and\nhis companions.” Everybody in Albay, however, assured me that the two\nScotchmen were the first to reach the top of the mountain. It is true\nthat in the above notice the ascent of the volcano is not directly\nmentioned; but the fact of the medal naturally leads us to suppose\nthat nothing less can be referred to. Arenas, in his memoir, says:\n\"Mayon was surveyed by Captain Siguenza. From the crater to the base,\nwhich is nearly at the level of the sea, he found that it measured\nsixteen hundred and eighty-two Spanish feet or four sixty-eight and\ntwo-third meters.” A little further on, he adds, that he had read\nin the records of the Society that they had had a gold medal struck\nin honor of Siguenza, who had made some investigations about the\nvolcano’s crater in 1823. He, therefore, appears to have had some\ndoubt about Siguenza’s actual ascent.",
        "[An early friar attempt.] According to the Franciscan records a couple\nof monks attempted the ascent in 1592, in order to cure the natives\nof their superstitious belief about the mountain. One of them never\nreturned; but the other, although he did not reach the summit, being\nstopped by three deep abysses, made a hundred converts to Christianity\nby the mere relation of his adventures. He died in the same year,\nin consequence, it is recorded, of the many variations of temperature\nto which he was exposed in his ascent of the volcano.",
        "[Estimates of height] Some books say that the mountain is of\nconsiderable height; but the Estado Geografico of the Franciscans for\n1855, where one could scarcely expect to find such a thoughtless\nrepetition of so gross a typographical error, says that the\nmeasurements of Siguenza give the mountain a height of sixteen\nhundred and eighty-two feet. According to my own barometrical reading,\nthe height of the summit above the level of the sea was twenty-three\nhundred and seventy-four meters, or eighty-five hundred and fifty-nine\nSpanish feet.",
        "[An accident and a month’s rest.] I sprained my foot so badly in\nascending Mayon that I was obliged to keep the house for a month. Under\nthe circumstances, I was not sorry to find myself settled in a roomy\nand comfortable dwelling. My house was built upon the banks of a\nsmall stream, and stood in the middle of a garden in which coffee,\ncacao, oranges, papayas, and bananas grew luxuriantly, in spite of\nthe tall weeds which surrounded them. Several over-ripe berries had\nfallen to the ground, and I had them collected, roasted, mixed with\nan equal quantity of sugar, and made into chocolate; an art in which\nthe natives greatly excel. With the Spaniards chocolate takes the\nplace of coffee and tea, and even the mestizos and the well-to-do\nnatives drink a great deal of it.",
        "[Cacao] The cacao-tree comes from Central America. It flourishes\nthere between the 23rd parallel north and the 20th south latitude;\nbut it is only at its best in the hottest and dampest climates. In\ntemperate climates, where the thermometer marks less than 23° C.,\nit produces no fruit.",
        "[High quality.] It was first imported into the Philippines from\nAcapulco; either, according to Camarines, by a pilot called Pedro\nBrabo de Lagunas, in 1670; or, according to Samar, by some Jesuits,\nduring Salcedo’s government, between 1663 and 1668. Since then\nit has spread over the greater part of the Island; and, although\nit is not cultivated with any excessive care, its fruit is of\nexcellent quality. The cacao of Albay, if its cheapness be taken into\nconsideration, may be considered at least equal to that of Caracas,\nwhich is so highly-prized in Europe, and which, on account of its\nhigh price, generally is largely mixed with inferior kinds. [74]\nThe bushes are usually found in small gardens, close to the houses;\nbut so great is the native laziness that frequently the berries are\nallowed to decay, although the local cacao sells for a higher price\nthan the imported. At Cebu and Negros a little more attention is paid\nto its cultivation; [Scanty production.] but it does not suffice to\nsupply the wants of the colony, which imports the deficiency from\nTernate and Mindanao. The best cacao of the Philippines is produced in\nthe small Island of Maripipi, which lies to the north-west of Leyte;\nand it is difficult to obtain, the entire crop generally being long\nbespoke. It costs about one dollar per liter, whereas the Albay cacao\ncosts from two to two and a half dollars per “ganta” (three liters).",
        "[Culture.] The natives generally cover the kernels, just as they\nare beginning to sprout, with a little earth, and, placing them\nin a spirally-rolled leaf, hang them up beneath the roof of their\ndwellings. They grow very rapidly, and, to prevent their being\nchoked by weeds, are planted out at very short intervals. This\nmethod of treatment is probably the reason that the cacao-trees in\nthe Philippines never attain a greater height than eight or ten feet,\nwhile in their native soil they frequently reach thirty, and sometimes\neven forty feet. The tree begins to bear fruit in its third or fourth\nyear, and in its fifth or sixth it reaches maturity, when it usually\nyields a “ganta” of cacao, which, as I have mentioned, is worth from\ntwo to two and a half dollars, and always finds a purchaser. [75]",
        "[Neglect.] The profits arising from a large plantation would,\ntherefore, be considerable; yet it is very rare to meet with one. I\nheard it said that the Economical Society had offered a considerable\nreward to any one who could exhibit a plantation of ten thousand\nberry-bearing trees; but in the Society’s report I found no mention\nof this reward.",
        "[Damage by storms.] The great obstacles in the way of large plantations\nare the heavy storms which recur almost regularly every year,\nand often destroy an entire plantation in a single day. In 1856 a\nhurricane visited the Island just before the harvest, and completely\ntore up several large plantations by the roots; a catastrophe that\nnaturally has caused much discouragement to the cultivators. [76]\nOne consequence of this state of things was that the free importation\nof cacao was permitted, and people were enabled to purchase Guayaqual\ncacao at fifteen dollars per quintal while that grown at home cost\ndouble the money.",
        "[Diseases and pests.] The plant is sometimes attacked by a disease,\nthe origin of which is unknown, when it suffers severely from certain\nnoxious insects. [77] It is also attacked by rats and other predatory\nvermin; the former sometimes falling upon it in such numbers that\nthey destroy the entire harvest in a single night. Travellers in\nAmerica say that a well-kept cacao plantation is a very picturesque\nsight. In the Philippines, however, or at any rate in East Luzon,\nthe closely-packed, lifeless-looking, moss-covered trees present a\ndreary spectacle. Their existence is a brief one. Their oval leaves,\nsometimes nearly a foot long, droop singly from the twigs, and form\nno luxuriant masses of foliage. Their blossoms are very insignificant;\nthey are of a reddish-yellow, no larger than the flowers of the lime,\nand grow separately on long weedy stalks. The fruit ripens in six\nmonths. When it is matured, it is of either a red or a yellow tint,\nand is somewhat like a very rough gherkin. Only two varieties appear to\nbe cultivated in the Philippines. [78] The pulp of the fruit is white,\ntender, and of an agreeable acid taste, and contains from eighteen\nto twenty-four kernels, arranged in five rows. These kernels are as\nlarge as almonds, and, like them, consist of a couple of husks and a\nsmall core. This is the cacao bean; which, roasted and finely ground,\nproduces cacao, and with the addition of sugar, and generally of\nspice, makes chocolate. Till the last few years, every household\nin the Philippines made its own chocolate, of nothing but cacao\nand sugar. The natives who eat chocolate often add roasted rice to\nit. Nowadays there is a manufactory in Manila, which makes chocolate\nin the European way. The inhabitants of the eastern provinces are\nvery fond of adding roasted pili nuts to their chocolate. [79]",
        "[Chocolate.] Europeans first learnt to make a drink from cacao in\nMexico, where the preparation was called chocolatl. [80] Even so far\nback as the days of Cortes, who was a tremendous chocolate drinker,\nthe cacao-tree was extensively cultivated. The Aztecs used the beans\nas money; and Montezuma used to receive part of his tribute in this\npeculiar coin. It was only the wealthy among the ancient Mexicans\nwho ate pure cacao; the poor, on account of the value of the beans\nas coins, used to mix maize and mandioca meal with them. Even in our\nown day the inhabitants of Central America make use of the beans as\nsmall coins, as they have no copper money, nor smaller silver coins\nthan the half-real. Both in Central America and in Orinoco there yet\nare many unpenetrated forests which are almost entirely composed of\nwild cacao-trees. I believe the natives gather some of their fruit,\nbut it is almost worthless. By itself it has much less flavor than the\ncultivated kinds. Certainly it is not picked and dried at the proper\nseason, and it gets spoilt in its long transit through the damp woods.",
        "[An uncertain venture.] Since the abolition of slavery, the crops in\nAmerica have been diminishing year by year, and until a short time ago,\nwhen the French laid out several large plantations in Central America,\nwere of but trifling value. According to F. Engel, a flourishing\ncacao plantation required less outlay and trouble, and yields more\nprofit than any other tropical plant; yet its harvests, which do not\nyield anything for the first five or six years, are very uncertain,\nowing to the numerous insects which attack the plants. In short,\ncacao plantations are only suited to large capitalists, or to very\nsmall cultivators who grow the trees in their own gardens. Moreover,\nas we have said, since the abolition of slavery most of the plantations\nhave fallen into decay, for the freed slaves are entirely wanting\nin industry.",
        "[Use in Europe.] The original chocolate was not generally relished\nin Europe. When, however, at a later period, it was mixed with sugar,\nit met with more approbation. The exaggerated praise of its admirers\nraised a bitter opposition amongst the opponents of the new drink;\nand the priests raised conscientious scruples against the use of so\nnourishing an article of food on fast days. The quarrel lasted till\nthe seventeenth century, by which time cacao had become an everyday\nnecessity in Spain. It was first introduced into Spain in 1520; but\nchocolate, on account of the monopoly of the Conquistadores, was for a\nlong time secretly prepared on the other side of the ocean. In 1580,\nhowever, it was in common use in Spain, though it was so entirely\nunknown in England that, in 1579, an English captain burnt a captured\ncargo of it as useless. It reached Italy in 1606, and was introduced\ninto France by Anne of Austria. The first chocolate-house in London\nwas opened in 1657, and in 1700 Germany at last followed suit. [81]",
        "[Coffee.] The history of coffee in the Philippines is very similar\nto that of cacao. The plant thrives wonderfully, and its berry has\nso strongly marked a flavor that the worst Manila coffee commands as\nhigh a price as the best Java. In spite of this, however, the amount\nof coffee produced in the Philippines is very insignificant, and,\nuntil lately, scarcely deserved mention. According to the report of an\nEnglishman in 1828, the coffee-plant was almost unknown forty years\nbefore, and was represented only by a few specimens in the Botanical\nGardens at Manila. It soon, however, increased and multiplied, thanks\nto the moderation of a small predatory animal (paradoxurus musanga),\nwhich only nibbled the ripe fruit, and left the hard kernels (the\ncoffee beans) untouched, as indigestible. The Economical Society\nbestirred itself in its turn by offering rewards to encourage the\nlaying out of large coffee plantations. In 1837 it granted to M. de\nla Gironnière a premium of $1,000, for exhibiting a coffee plantation\nof sixty thousand plants, which were yielding their second harvest;\nand four premiums to others in the following year. But as soon as\nthe rewards were obtained the plantations were once more allowed to\nfall into neglect. From this it is pretty evident that the enterprise,\nin the face of the then market prices and the artificially high rates\nof freight, did not afford a sufficient profit.",
        "[Exports.] In 1856 the exports of coffee were not more than seven\nthousand piculs; in 1865 they had increased to thirty-seven thousand,\nfive hundred and eighty-eight; and in 1871, to fifty-three thousand,\nthree hundred and seventy. This increase, however, affords no criterion\nby which to estimate the increase in the number of plantations,\nfor these make no returns for the first few years after being laid\nout. In short, larger exports may be confidently expected. But even\ngreatly increased exports could not be taken as correct measures\nof the colony’s resources. Not till European capital calls large\nplantations into existence in the most suitable localities will the\nPhilippines obtain their proper rank in the coffee-producing districts\nof the world.",
        "[Highest grades.] The best coffee comes from the provinces of\nLaguna, Batangas and Cavite; the worst from Mindanao. The latter,\nin consequence of careless treatment, is very impure, and generally\ncontains a quantity of bad beans. The coffee beans of Mindanao are\nof a yellowish-white color and flabby; those of Laguna are smaller,\nbut much firmer in texture.",
        "[French preference.] Manila coffee is very highly esteemed by\nconnoisseurs, and is very expensive, though it is by no means so\nnice looking as that of Ceylon and other more carefully prepared\nkinds. It is a remarkable fact that in 1865 France, which imported\nonly $21,000 worth of hemp from the Philippines, imported more than\n$200,000 worth of Manila coffee, a third of the entire coffee produce\nof the Islands. [82] Manila coffee is not much prized in London,\nand does not fetch much more than good Ceylon ($15 per cwt.). [83]\nThis, however, is no reproach to the coffee, as every one acquainted\nwith an Englishman’s appreciation of coffee will allow.",
        "[Prices.] California, an excellent customer, always ready to give\na fair price for a good article, will in time become one of its\nprincipal consumers. [84] In 1868, coffee in Manila itself cost\nan average of $16 per picul. [85] In Java, the authorities pay the\nnatives, who are compelled to cultivate it, about $3.66 per picul.",
        "[Philippine exports.] Although the amount of coffee exported from the\nPhilippines is trifling in comparison with the producing powers of the\ncolony, it compares favorably with the exports from other countries.",
        "[Javan and Ceylon crops.] In my Sketches of Travel, I compared the\ndecrease of the coffee produced in Java under the forced system of\ncultivation with the increase of that voluntarily grown in Ceylon,\nand gave the Javanese produce for 1858 as sixty-seven thousand tons,\nand the Cingalese as thirty-five thousand tons. Since that time the\nrelative decrease and increase have continued; and in 1866 the Dutch\nIndies produced only fifty-six thousand tons, and Ceylon thirty-six\nthousand tons. [86]",
        "[Amateur scientists.] During my enforced stay in Daraga the natives\nbrought me mussels and snails for sale; and several of them wished\nto enter my service, as they felt “a particular vocation for Natural\nHistory.” At last my kitchen was always full of them. They sallied\nforth every day to collect insects, and as a rule were not particularly\nfortunate in their search; but this was of no consequence; in fact,\nit served to give them a fresh appetite for their meals. Some of the\nneighboring Spaniards paid me almost daily visits; and several of\nthe native and mestizo dignitaries from a distance were good enough\nto call upon me, not so much for the purpose of seeing my humble self\nas of inspecting my hat, the fame of which had spread over the whole\nprovince. It was constructed in the usual judicious mushroom shape,\ncovered with nito, [87] and its pinnacle was adorned with a powerful\noil lamp, furnished with a closely fitting lid, like that of a dark\nlantern, so that it could be carried in the pocket. This last was\nparticularly useful when riding about on a dark night.",
        "[Nito cigar cases.] In the neighboring pueblo cigar-cases were\nmade out of this nito. They are not of much use as an article of\ncommerce, and usually are only made to order. To obtain a dozen a\nwould-be purchaser must apply to as many individuals, who, at the\nshortest, will condescend to finish one in a few months. The stalk\nof the fern, which is about as thick as a lucifer match, is split\ninto four strips. The workman then takes a strip in his left hand,\nand, with his thumb on the back and his forefinger on the edge, draws\nthe strips up and down against the knife blade until the soft pithy\nparts are cut away, and what remains has become fine enough for the\nnext process. The cases are made on pointed cylindrical pieces of\nwood almost a couple of feet long. A pin is stuck into the center\nof the end of the cylinder, and the workman commences by fastening\nthe strips of fern stalk to it. The size of the case corresponds to\nthe  diameter of the roller, and a small wooden disk is placed in the\nbottom of the case to keep it steady while the sides are being plaited.",
        "[A Filipino theater.] When my ankle began to get better, my\nfirst excursion was to Legaspi, where some Filipinos were giving\na theatrical performance. A Spanish political refugee directed\nthe entertainment. On each side of the stage, roofed in with palm\nleaves, ran covered galleries for the dignitaries of the place; the\nuncovered space between these was set apart for the common people. The\nperformers had chosen a play taken from Persian history. The language\nwas Spanish, and the dresses were, to say the least, eccentric. The\nstage was erected hard by a public street, which itself formed part\nof the auditorium, and the noise was so great that I could only catch\na word here and there. The actors stalked on, chattering their parts,\nwhich not one of them understood, and moving their arms up and down;\nand when they reached the edge of the stage, they tacked and went back\nagain like ships sailing against the wind. Their countenances were\nentirely devoid of expression, and they spoke like automatons. If I\nhad understood the words, the contrast between their meaning and the\nmachine-like movements of the actors would probably have been droll\nenough; but, as it was, the noise, the heat, and the smoke were so\ngreat that we soon left the place.",
        "[An indifferent performance.] Both the theatrical performance and\nthe whole festival bore the impress of laziness, indifference, and\nmindless mimicry. When I compared the frank cheerfulness I had seen\nradiating from every countenance at the religious holidays of Europe\nwith the expressionless and immobile faces of the natives, I found it\ndifficult to understand how the latter were persuaded to waste so much\ntime and money upon a matter they seemed so thoroughly indifferent to.",
        "[Interest in festival.] Travellers have remarked the same want of\ngaiety amongst the Indians of America; and some of them ascribe it\nto the small development of the nervous system prevalent among these\npeoples, to which cause also they attribute their wonderful courage\nin bearing pain. But Tylor observes that the Indian’s countenance is\nso different from ours that it takes us several years to rightly\ninterpret its expression. There probably is something in both\nthese explanations. And, although I observed no lively expression of\namusement among my native friends at Legaspi, I noticed that they took\nthe greatest possible pleasure in decorating their village, and that\nthe procession which formed part of the festival had extraordinary\ncharms for them. Every individual was dressed in his very best; and\nthe honor of carrying a banner inspired those who attained it with the\ngreatest pride, and raised an amazing amount of envy in the breasts of\nthe remainder. Visitors poured in from all the surrounding hamlets, and\nerected triumphal arches which they had brought with them ready-made\nand which bore some complimentary inscription. I am obliged to confess\nthat some of the holiday-makers were very drunk. The inhabitants of the\nPhilippines have a great love for strong drink; even the young girls\noccasionally get intoxicated. When night came on, the strangers were\nhospitably lodged in the dwellings of the village. On such occasions\nnative hospitality shows itself in a very favorable light. The door\nof every house stands open, and even balls take place in some of the\nlarger hamlets. The Spanish and mestizo cavaliers, however, condescend\nto dance only with mestiza partners, and very seldom invite a pretty\nnative girl to join them. The natives very rarely dance together; but\nin Samar I was present on one occasion at a by no means ungraceful\nnative dance where “improvised” verses were sung. The male dancer\ncompared his partner with a rose, and she answered he should be\ncareful in touching it as a rose had thorns. This would have been\nthought a charming compliment in the mouth of an Andalusian.",
        "[Servant subterfuges.] The idle existence we spent in Daraga was so\nagreeable to my servants and their numerous friends that they were\nanxious I should stay there as long as possible; and they adopted some\nvery ingenious means to persuade me to do so. Twice, when everything\nwas prepared for a start the next morning, my shoes were stolen in the\nnight; and on another occasion they kidnapped my horse. When a native\nhas a particularly heavy load to carry, or a long journey to make,\nhe thinks nothing of coolly appropriating the well-fed beast of some\nSpaniard; which, when he has done with it, he turns loose without\nattempting to feed it, and it wanders about till somebody catches\nit and stalls it in the nearest “Tribunal.” There it is kept tied up\nand hungry until its master claims it and pays its expenses. I had a\ndollar to pay when I recovered mine, although it was nearly starved\nto death, on the pretence that it had swallowed rice to that value\nsince it had been caught.",
        "[Petty robberies.] Small robberies occur very frequently, but they\nare committed–as an acquaintance, a man who had spent some time\nin the country, informed me one evening when I was telling him my\ntroubles–only upon the property of new arrivals; old residents, he\nsaid, enjoyed a prescriptive freedom from such little inconveniences. I\nfancy some waggish native must have overheard our conversation, for\nearly the next morning my friend, the old resident, sent to borrow\nchocolate, biscuits, and eggs of me, as his larder and his hen-house\nhad been rifled during the night.",
        "[Daraga market.] Monday and Friday evenings were the Daraga market\nnights, and in fine weather always afforded a pretty sight. The\nwomen, neatly and cleanly clad, sat in long rows and offered their\nprovisions for sale by the light of hundreds of torches; and, when\nthe business was over, the slopes of the mountains were studded all\nover with flickering little points of brightness proceeding from the\ntorches carried by the homeward-bound market women. Besides eatables,\nmany had silks and stuffs woven from the fibers of the pine-apple\nand the banana for sale. These goods they carried on their heads;\nand I noticed that all the younger women were accompanied by their\nsweethearts, who relieved them of their burdens.",
        "[Change of season.] During the whole time I was confined to the\nhouse at Daraga, the weather was remarkably fine; but unfortunately\nthe bright days had come to an end by the time I was ready to make a\nstart, for the north-east monsoon, the sure forerunner of rain in this\npart of the Archipelago, sets in in October. In spite, however, of the\nweather, I determined to make another attempt to ascend the mountain\nat Bulusan. I found I could go by boat to Bacon in the Bay of Albay,\na distance of seven leagues, whence I could ride to Gubat, on the east\ncoast, three leagues further, and then in a southerly direction along\nthe shore to Bulusan. An experienced old native, who provided a boat\nand crew, had appointed ten o’clock at night as the best time for\nmy departure. Just as we were about to start, however, we were told\nthat four piratical craft had been seen in the bay. In a twinkling,\nthe crew disappeared, and I was left alone in the darkness; and it\ntook me four hours with the assistance of a Spaniard to find them\nagain, and make a fresh start. About nine o’clock in the morning we\nreached Bacon, whence I rode across a very flat country to San Roque,\nwhere the road leading to Gubat took a sharp turn to the south-east,\nand presently became an extremely bad one. After I had passed Gubat,\nmy way lay along the shore; and I saw several ruined square towers,\nmade of blocks of coral, and built by the Jesuits as a protection\nagainst the [Moro pirates.] Moros, or “Moors\"–a term here applied to\nthe pirates, because, like the Moors who were formerly in Spain, they\nare Mahometans. They come from Mindanao and from the north-west coast\nof Borneo. At the time of my visit, this part of the Archipelago was\ngreatly infested with them; and a few days before my arrival they had\ncarried off some fishermen, who were busy pulling their fish-stakes,\nclose to Gubat. A little distance from the shore, and parallel to it,\nran a coral reef, which during the south-west monsoon was here and\nthere bare at low tide; but, when the north-east wind blew, the waves\nof the Pacific Ocean entirely concealed it. Upon this reef the storms\nhad cast up many remains of marine animals, and a quantity of fungi,\namongst which I noticed some exactly resembling the common sponge of\nthe Mediterranean. They were just as soft to the touch, of a dark brown\ntint, as large as the fist, and of a conical shape. They absorbed water\nwith great readiness, and might doubtless be made a profitable article\nof commerce. Samples of them are to be seen in the Zoological Museum at\nBerlin. As I went further on, I found the road excellent; and wooden\nbridges, all of which were in good repair, led me across the mouths\nof the numerous small rivers. But almost all the arches of the stone\nbridges I came to had fallen in, and I had to cross the streams they\nwere supposed to span in a small boat, and make my horse swim after\nme. Just before I reached Bulusan, I had to cross a ravine several\nhundred feet deep, composed almost entirely of white pumice stone.",
        "[Bulusan.] Bulusan is so seldom visited by strangers that the\n\"tribunal” where I put up was soon full of curiosity-mongers, who came\nto stare at me. The women, taking the places of honor, squatted round\nme in concentric rows, while the men peered over their shoulders. One\nmorning when I was taking a shower-bath in a shed made of open bamboo\nwork, I suddenly noticed several pairs of inquisitive eyes staring\nat me through the interstices. The eyes belonged exclusively to the\ngentler sex; and their owners examined me with the greatest curiosity,\nmaking remarks upon my appearance to one another, and seeming by no\nmeans inclined to be disturbed. Upon another occasion, when bathing in\nthe open air in the province of Laguna, I was surrounded by a number of\nwomen, old, middle-aged, and young, who crowded round me while I was\ndressing, carefully inspected me, and pointed out with their fingers\nevery little detail which seemed to them to call for special remark.",
        "[Storm damage.] I had travelled the last part of the road to Bulusan\nin wind and rain; and the storm lasted with little intermission during\nthe whole night. When I got up in the morning I found that part of the\nroof of the tribunal had been carried away, that the slighter houses\nin the hamlet were all blown down, and that almost every dwelling in\nthe place had lost its roof. This pleasant weather lasted during the\nthree days of my stay. The air was so thick that I found it impossible\nto distinguish the volcano, though I was actually standing at its\nfoot; and, as the weather-wise of the neighborhood could hold out no\npromise of a favorable change at that time of the year, I put off my\nintended ascent till a better opportunity, and resolved to return. A\nformer alcalde, Peñeranda, was reported to have succeeded in reaching\nthe top fifteen years before, after sixty men had spent a couple of\nmonths in building a road to the summit; and the ascent was said to\nhave taken him two whole days. But an experienced native told me that\nin the dry season he thought four men were quite sufficient to open a\nnarrow path to the plateau, just under the peak, in a couple of days;\nbut that ladders were required to get on to the actual summit.",
        "[Arrival of assistance.] The day after my arrival the inspector of\nhighways and another man walked into the tribunal, both of them wet to\nthe skin and nearly blown to pieces. My friend the alcalde had sent\nthem to my assistance; and, as none of us could attempt the ascent,\nthey returned with me. As we were entering Bacon on our way back,\nwe heard the report of cannon and the sound of music. Our servants\ncried out “Here comes the alcalde,” and in a few moments he drove up\nin an open carriage, accompanied by an irregular escort of horsemen,\nSpaniards and natives, the latter prancing about in silk hats and\nshirts fluttering in the wind. The alcalde politely offered me a seat,\nand an hour’s drive took us into Sorsogon.",
        "[Albay roads and bridges.] The roads of the province of Albay are good,\nbut they are by no means kept in good repair: a state of things that\nwill never be remedied so long as the indolence of the authorities\ncontinues. Most of the stone bridges in the district are in ruins,\nand the traveller is obliged to content himself with wading through a\nford, or get himself ferried across upon a raft or in a small canoe,\nwhile his horse swims behind him. The roads were first laid down in the\ndays of Alcalde Peñaranda, a retired officer of the engineer corps,\nwhom we have already mentioned, and who deserves considerable praise\nfor having largely contributed to the welfare of his province, and\nfor having accomplished so much from such small resources. He took\ncare that all socage service should be duly rendered, or that money,\nwhich went towards paying for tools and materials, should be paid\nin lieu of it. Many abuses existed before his rule; no real services\nwere performed by anybody who could trace the slightest relationship\nto any of the authorities; and, when by chance any redemption money\nwas paid, it went, often with the connivance of the alcalde of the\nperiod, into the pockets of the gobernadorcillos, instead of into the\nprovincial treasury. Similar abuses still prevail all over the country,\nwhere they are not prevented by the vigilance of the authorities. The\nnumerous population, and the prosperity which the province now enjoys,\nwould make it an easy matter to maintain and complete the existing\nhighways. The admirable officials of the district are certainly\nnot wanting in good-will, but their hands are tied. Nowadays the\nalcaldes remain only three years in one province (in Peñaranda’s\ntime, they remained six); their time is entirely taken up with\nthe current official and judicial business; and, just as they are\nbeginning to become acquainted with the capabilities and requirements\nof their district, they are obliged to leave it. [Handicapped\nofficials.] This shows the government’s want of confidence in its\nown servants. No alcalde could now possibly undertake what Peñaranda\naccomplished. The money paid in lieu of socage service, which ought to\nbe applied to the wants of the province in which the socage is due, is\nforwarded to Manila. If an alcalde proposes some urgent and necessary\nimprovement, he has to send in so many tedious estimates and reports,\nwhich frequently remain unnoticed, that he soon loses all desire to\nattempt any innovation. Estimates for large works, to carry out which\nwould require a considerable outlay, are invariably returned from\nheadquarters marked “not urgent.” [Funds diverted to Spain.] The fact\nis not that the colonial government is wanting in good-will, but that\nthe Caja de Comunidad (General Treasury) in Manila is almost always\nempty, as the Spanish government, in its chronic state of bankruptcy,\nborrows the money and is never in a position to return it.",
        "[Sorsogon earthquake.] In 1840 Sorsogon suffered severely from an\nearthquake, which lasted almost continuously for thirty-five days. It\nraged with the greatest fury on the 21st of March. The churches, both\nof Sorsogon and of Casiguran, as well as the smallest stone houses,\nwere destroyed; seventeen persons lost their lives, and two hundred\nwere injured; and the whole neighborhood sank five feet below its\nformer level.",
        "[Casiguran.] The next morning I accompanied the alcalde in a falua\n(felucca), manned by fourteen rowers, to Casiguran, which lies directly\nsouth of Sorsogon, on the other side of a small bay, of two leagues\nin breadth, which it took us an hour and a half to cross. The bay was\nas calm as an inland lake. It is almost entirely surrounded by hills,\nand its western side, which is open to the sea, is protected by the\nIsland of Bagalao, which lies in front of it. As soon as we landed,\nwe were received with salutes of cannon and music, and flags and\nshirts streamed in the wind. I declined the friendly invitation of the\nalcalde to accompany him any further; as to me, who had no official\nbusiness to transact, the journey seemed nothing but a continually\nrecurring panorama of dinners, lunches, cups of chocolate, music,\nand detonations of gunpowder.",
        "[Quicksilver.] In 1850 quicksilver was discovered on a part of the\ncoast now covered by the sea. I examined the reported bed of the\ndeposit, and it appeared to me to consist of a stratum of clay six feet\nin depth, superimposed over a layer of volcanic sand and fragments\nof pumice stone. An Englishman who was wrecked in this part of the\nArchipelago, the same individual I met at the iron works at Angat, had\nbegun to collect it, and by washing the sand had obtained something\nlike a couple of ounces. Somebody, however, told the priest of the\ndistrict that quicksilver was a poison; and, as he himself told me,\nso forcibly did he depict the dangerous nature of the new discovery to\nhis parishioners that they abandoned the attempt to collect it. Since\nthen none of them have ever seen a vestige of mercury, unless it might\nbe from some broken old barometer. Towards evening Mount Bulusan in\nthe south-east, and Mount Mayon in the north-west, were visible for\na short time. They are both in a straight line with Casiguran.",
        "[Sea’s encroachments.] Every year the sea makes great inroads upon\nthe coast at Casiguran; as far as I could decide from its appearance\nand from the accounts given me, about a yard of the shore is annually\ndestroyed. The bay of Sorsogon is protected towards the north by a\nridge of hills, which suddenly terminate, however, at its north-eastern\nangle; and through this opening the wind sometimes blows with great\nfury, and causes considerable havoc in the bay, the more particularly\nas its coast is principally formed of clay and sand.",
        "[Pirate rumors and robberies.] When I reached Legaspi again in the\nevening I learnt that the alarm about the pirates which had interrupted\nmy departure had not been an idle one. Moros they certainly could\nnot have been, for at that season none of the Mahometan corsairs\ncould reach that part of the coast; but they were a band of deserters\nand vagabonds from the surrounding country, who in this part of the\nworld find it more agreeable to pursue their freebooting career on\nsea than on land. During my absence they had committed many robberies\nand carried off several people. [88]",
        "[Real pirates.] The beginning of November is the season of storms;\nwhen water communication between Albay and Manila entirely ceases,\nno vessel daring to put out to sea, even from the south coast. On\nthe 9th of the month, however, a vessel that had been given up for\nlost entered the port, after having incurred great perils and being\nobliged to throw overboard the greater part of its cargo. Within twelve\ndays of its leaving the straits of San Bernardino behind it, a sudden\nstorm compelled it to anchor amongst the Islands of Balicuatro. One\nof the passengers, a newly-arrived Spaniard, put off in a boat with\nseven sailors, and made for four small vessels which were riding at\nanchor off the coast; taking them for fishermen, whereas they were\npirates. They fired at him as soon as he was some distance from his\nship, and his crew threw themselves into the water; but both he and\nthey were taken prisoners. The captain of the trading brig, fearing\nthat his vessel would fall into their clutches, slipped anchor and put\nout to sea again, escaping shipwreck with the greatest difficulty. The\npirates, as a rule, do not kill their prisoners, but employ them as\nrowers. But Europeans seldom survive their captivity: the tremendous\nlabor and the scanty food are too much for them. Their clothes always\nbeing stripped off their back, they are exposed naked to all sorts\nof weather, and their sole daily support is a handful of rice.",
        "[Camarines.] No favorable change in the weather was expected in\nAlbay before the month of January. It stormed and rained all day. I\ntherefore determined to change my quarters to South Camarines, which,\nprotected from the monsoon by the high range of hills running along\nits north-eastern boundary, enjoyed more decent weather. The two\nprovinces of Camarines form a long continent, with its principal\nfrontage of shore facing to the north-east and to the south-west;\nwhich is about ten leagues broad in its middle, and has its shores\nindented by many bays. From about the center of its north-eastern\nshore there boldly projects the Peninsula of Caramuan, connected with\nthe mainland of Camarines by the isthmus of Isarog. The north-eastern\nportion of the two provinces contains a long range of volcanic hills;\nthe south-western principally consisted, as far as my investigations\npermitted me to discover, of chalk, and coral reefs; in the midst\nof the hills extends a winding and fertile valley, which collects\nthe waters descending from the slopes of the mountain ranges, and\nblends them into a navigable river, on the banks of which several\nflourishing hamlets have established themselves. This river is called\nthe Bicol. The streams which give it birth are so abundant, and the\nslope of the sides of the valley, which is turned into one gigantic\nrice-field, is so gentle that in many places the lazy waters linger\nand form small lakes.",
        "[A chain of volcanoes.] Beginning at the south-eastern extremity, the\nvolcanoes of Bulusan, Albay, Mazaraga, Iriga, Isarog, and Colasi–the\nlast on the northern side of San Miguel bay–are situated in a straight\nline, extending from the south-east to the north-west. Besides these,\nthere is the volcano of Buhi, or Malinao, a little to the north-east of\nthe line. The hamlets in the valley I have mentioned are situated in\na second line parallel to that of the volcanoes. The southern portion\nof the province is sparsely inhabited, and but few streams find their\nway from its plateau into the central valley. The range of volcanoes\nshuts out, as I have said, the north-east winds, and condenses their\nmoisture in the little lakes scattered on its slopes. The south-west\nportion of Camarines, therefore, is dry during the north-east monsoon,\nand enjoys its rainy season during the prevalence of the winds that\nblow from the south-west. The so-called dry season which, so far as\nSouth Camarines is concerned, begins in November, is interrupted,\nhowever, by frequent showers; but from January to May scarcely a drop\nof rain falls. The change of monsoon takes place in May and June;\nand its arrival is announced by violent thunderstorms and hurricanes,\nwhich frequently last without cessation for a couple of weeks, and\nare accompanied by heavy rains. These last are the beginning of the\nwet season proper, which lasts till October. The road passes the\nhamlets of Camalig, Guinobatan, Ligao, Oas and Polangui, situated\nin a straight line on the banks of the river Quinali, which, after\nreceiving numerous tributary streams, becomes navigable soon after\npassing Polangui. Here I observed a small settlement of huts, which\nis called after the river. Each of the hamlets I have mentioned, with\nthe exception of the last, has a population of about fourteen thousand\nsouls, although they are situated not more than half a league apart.",
        "[Priestly assistance.] The convents in this part of the country are\nlarge, imposing buildings, and their incumbents, who were mostly old\nmen, were most hospitable and kind to me. Every one of them insisted\nupon my staying with him, and, after doing all he could for me, passed\nme on to his next colleague with the best recommendations. I wished\nto hire a boat at Polangui to cross the lake of Batu, but the only\ncraft I could find were a couple of barotos about eight feet long,\nhollowed out of the trunks of trees and laden with rice. To prevent\nmy meeting with any delay, the padre purchased the cargo of one of\nthe boats, on the condition of its being immediately unladen; and\nthis kindness enabled me to continue my journey in the afternoon.",
        "[The priests’ importance.] If a traveller gets on good terms with\nthe priests he seldom meets with any annoyances. Upon one occasion\nI wished to make a little excursion directly after lunch, and at a\nquarter past eleven everything was ready for a start; when I happened\nto say that it was a pity to have to wait three-quarters of an hour\nfor the meal. In a minute or two twelve o’clock struck; all work in\nthe village ceased, and we sat down to table: it was noon. A message\nhad been sent to the village bell-ringer that the Señor Padre thought\nhe must be asleep, and that it must be long past twelve as the Señor\nPadre was hungry. Il est l’heure que votre Majesté désire.",
        "[Franciscan friars.] Most of the priests in the eastern provinces of\nLuzon and Samar are Franciscan monks (The barefooted friars of the\northodox and strictest rule of Our Holy Father St. Francis, in the\nPhilippine Islands, of the Holy and Apostolic Province of St. Gregory\nthe Great), brought up in seminaries in Spain specially devoted to the\ncolonial missions. Formerly they were at liberty, after ten years’\nresidence in the Philippines, to return to their own country; but,\nsince the abolition of the monasteries in Spain, they can do this\nno longer, for they are compelled in the colonies to abandon all\nobedience to the rule of their order, and to live as laymen. They are\naware that they must end their days in the colony, and regulate their\nlives accordingly. On their first arrival they are generally sent to\nsome priest in the province to make themselves acquainted with the\nlanguage of the country; then they are installed into a small parish,\nand afterwards into a more lucrative one, in which they generally\nremain till their death. Most of them spring from the very lowest\nclass of Spaniards. A number of pious trusts and foundations in Spain\nenable a very poor man, who cannot afford to send his son to school,\nto put him into a religious seminary, where, beyond the duties of\nhis future avocation, the boy learns nothing. If the monks were of\na higher social grade, as are some of the English missionaries, they\nwould have less inclination to mix with the common people, and would\nfail to exercise over them the influence they wield at present. The\nearly habits of the Spanish monks, and their narrow knowledge of the\nworld, peculiarly fit them for an existence among the natives. This\nmental equality, or rather, this want of mental disparity, has enabled\nthem to acquire the influence they undoubtedly possess.",
        "[Young men developed by responsibility.] When these young men\nfirst come from their seminaries they are narrow-brained, ignorant,\nfrequently almost devoid of education, and full of conceit, hatred of\nheretics, and proselytish ardor. These failings, however, gradually\ndisappear; the consideration and the comfortable incomes they enjoy\ndeveloping their benevolence. The insight into mankind and the\nconfidence in themselves which distinguish the lower classes of the\nSpaniards, and which are so amusingly exemplified in Sancho Panza,\nhave plenty of occasions to display themselves in the responsible\nand influential positions which the priests occupy. The padre is\nfrequently the only white man in his village, probably the only\nEuropean for miles around. He becomes the representative not only\nof religion, but of the government; he is the oracle of the natives,\nand his decisions in everything that concerns Europe and civilization\nare without appeal. His advice is asked in all important emergencies,\nand he has no one whom he in his turn can consult. Such a state\nof things naturally develops his brain. The same individuals who\nin Spain would have followed the plough, in the colonies carry out\ngreat undertakings. Without any technical education, and without any\nscientific knowledge, they build churches and bridges, and construct\nroads. [Poor architects.] The circumstances therefore are greatly in\nfavor of the development of priestly ability; but it would probably\nbe better for the buildings if they were erected by more experienced\nmen, for the bridges are remarkably prone to fall in, the churches\nlook like sheep-pens, and the roads soon go to rack and ruin. I\nhad much intercourse in Camarines and Albay with the priests, and\nconceived a great liking for them all. As a rule, they are the most\nunpretending of men; and a visit gives them so much pleasure that\nthey do all in their power to make their guest’s stay as agreeable as\npossible. Life in a large convent has much resemblance to that of a\nlord of the manor in Eastern Europe. Nothing can be more unconstrained,\nmore unconventional. A visitor lives as independently as in an hotel,\nand many of the visitors behave themselves as if it were one. I have\nseen a subaltern official arrive, summon the head servant, move into\na room, order his meal, and then inquire casually whether the padre,\nwho was an utter stranger to him, was at home.",
        "The priests of the Philippines have often been reproached with gross\nimmorality. They are said to keep their convents full of bevies of\npretty girls, and to lead somewhat the same sort of life as the Grand\nTurk. This may be true of the native padres; but I myself never saw,\nin any of the households of the numerous Spanish priests I visited,\nanything that could possibly cause the least breath of scandal. Their\nservants were exclusively men, though perhaps I may have noticed\nhere and there an old woman or two. Ribadeneyra says:–\"The natives,\nwho observe how careful the Franciscan monks are of their chastity,\nhave arrived at the conclusion that they are not really men, and\nthat, though the devil had often attempted to lead these holy men\nastray, using the charms of some pretty Indian girl as a bait, yet,\nto the confusion of both damsel and devil, the monks had always\ncome scathless out of the struggle.” Ribadeneyra, however, is a very\nunreliable author; and, if his physiological mistakes are as gross as\nhis geographical ones (he says somewhere that Luzon is another name\nfor the island of Cebu!), the monks are not perhaps as fireproof as\nhe supposes. At any rate, his description does not universally apply\nnowadays. The younger priests pass their existence like the lords of\nthe soil of old; the young girls consider it an honor to be allowed to\nassociate with them; and the padres in their turn find many convenient\nopportunities. They have no jealous wives to pry into their secrets,\nand their position as confessors and spiritual advisers affords them\nplenty of pretexts for being alone with the women. The confessional,\nin particular, must be a perilous rock-a-head for most of them. In\nan appendix to the “Tagal Grammar” (which, by-the-bye, is not added\nto the editions sold for general use) a list of questions is given\nfor the convenience of young priests not yet conversant with the\nTagal language. These questions are to be asked in the confessional,\nand several pages of them relate exclusively to the relations between\nthe sexes.",
        "[Superiority over government officials.] As the alcaldes remain only\nthree years in any one province, they never understand much of its\nlanguage; and, being much occupied with their official business,\nthey have neither the time nor the desire to become acquainted\nwith the peculiarities of the districts over which they rule. The\npriest, on the other hand, resides continually in the midst of his\nparishioners, is perfectly acquainted with each of them, and even,\non occasion, protects them against the authorities; his, therefore,\nis the real jurisdiction in the district. The position of the priests,\nin contradistinction to that of the government officials, is well\nexpressed by their respective dwellings. The casas reales, generally\nsmall, ugly, and frequently half-ruined habitations, are not suited\nto the dignity of the chief authority of the province. The convento,\non the contrary, is almost always a roomy, imposing, and well-arranged\nbuilding. In former days, when governorships were sold to adventurers\nwhose only care was to enrich themselves, the influence of the minister\nof religion was even greater than it is now. [89]",
        "[Former legal status.] The following extract from the General\nOrders, given by Le Gentil, will convey a clear idea of their former\nposition:–",
        "“Whereas the tenth chapter of the ordinances, wherein the governor of\nArandia ordained that the alcaldes and the justices should communicate\nwith the missionary priests only by letter, and that they should never\nhold any interview with them except in the presence of a witness, has\nbeen frequently disobeyed, it is now commanded that these disobediences\nshall no longer be allowed; and that the alcaldes shall make it their\nbusiness to see that the priests and ministers of religion treat the\ngobernadorcillos and the subaltern officers of justice with proper\nrespect, and that the aforesaid priests be not allowed either to beat,\nchastise, or ill-treat the latter, or make them wait at table.”",
        "[Alcaldes formerly in trade.] The former alcaldes who, without\nexperience in official business, without either education or knowledge,\nand without either the brains or the moral qualifications for such\nresponsible and influential posts, purchased their appointments from\nthe State, or received them in consequence of successful intrigues,\nreceived a nominal salary from the government, and paid it tribute for\nthe right to carry on trade. Arenas considered this tribute paid by the\nalcaldes as a fine imposed upon them for an infringement of the law;\n\"for several ordinances were in existence, strenuously forbidding\nthem to dabble in any kind of commerce, until it pleased his Catholic\nMajesty to grant them a dispensation.” The latter sources of mischief\nwere, however, abolished by royal decree in September and October,\n1844.",
        "[Their borrowed capital.] The alcaldes were at the same time governors,\nmagistrates, commanders of the troops, and, in reality, the only\ntraders in their province. [90] They purchased with the resources\nof the obras pias the articles required in the province; and they\nwere entirely dependent for their capital upon these endowments,\nas they almost always arrived in the Philippines without any means\nof their own. The natives were forced to sell their produce to the\nalcaldes and, besides, to purchase their goods at the prices fixed\nby the latter. [91] In this corrupt state of things the priests were\nthe only protectors of the unfortunate Filipinos; though occasionally\nthey also threw in their lot with the alcaldes, and shared in the\nspoil wrung from their unfortunate flocks.",
        "[Improvement in present appointees.] Nowadays men with some knowledge\nof the law are sent out to the Philippines as alcaldes; the government\npays them a small salary, and they are not allowed to trade. The\nauthorities also attempt to diminish the influence of the priests by\nimproving the position of the civil tribunals; a state of things they\nwill not find easy of accomplishment unless they lengthen the period\nof service of the alcaldes, and place them in a pecuniary position\nthat will put them beyond the temptation of pocketing perquisites. [92]",
        "In Huc’s work on China I find the following passage, relating to the\neffects of the frequent official changes in China, from which many\nhints may be gathered:–",
        "[Similarity with Chinese conditions.] “The magisterial offices\nare no longer bestowed upon upright and just individuals and, as a\nconsequence, this once flourishing and well-governed kingdom is day\nby day falling into decay, and is rapidly gliding down the path that\nleads to a terrible and, perhaps, speedy dissolution. When we seek\nto discover the cause of the general ruin, the universal corruption\nwhich too surely is undermining all classes of Chinese society, we are\nconvinced that it is to be found in the complete abandonment of the\nold system of government effected by the Manchu dynasty. It issued\na decree forbidding any mandarin to hold any post longer than three\nyears in the same province, and prohibiting any one from possessing\nany official appointment in his native province. One does not form\na particularly high idea of the brain which conceived this law; but,\nwhen the Manchu Tartars found that they were the lords of the empire,\nthey began to be alarmed at their small numbers, which were trifling\nin comparison with the countless swarms of the Chinese; and they\ndreaded lest the influence which the higher officials would acquire\nin their districts might enable them to excite the populace against\ntheir foreign rulers.",
        "[Unidentified with country.] “The magistrates, being allowed to\nremain only a year or two in the same province, lived there like\nstrangers, without acquainting themselves with the wants of the people\nthey governed; there was no tie between them. The only care of the\nmandarins was to amass as much wealth as possible before they quitted\ntheir posts; and they then began the same game in a fresh locality,\nuntil finally they returned home in possession of a handsome fortune\ngradually collected in their different appointments. They were only\nbirds of passage. What did it matter? The morrow would find them\nat the other end of the kingdom, where the cries of their plundered\nvictims would be unable to reach them. In this manner the governmental\npolicy rendered the mandarins selfish and indifferent. The basis\nof the monarchy is destroyed, for the magistrate is no longer a\npaternal ruler residing amongst and mildly swaying his children, but a\nmarauder, who arrives no man knows whence, and who departs no one knows\nwhither. The consequence is universal stagnation; no great undertakings\nare accomplished; and the works and labors of former dynasties are\nallowed to fall into decay. The mandarins say to themselves: ’Why\nshould we undertake what we can never accomplish? Why should we sow\nthat others may reap?’... They take no interest in the affairs of the\ndistrict; as a rule, they are suddenly transplanted into the midst of\na population whose dialect even they do not understand. [Dependence on\ninterpreters.] When they arrive in their mandarinates they usually find\ninterpreters, who, being permanent officieals and interested in the\naffairs of the place, know how to make their services indispensable;\nand these in reality are the absolute rulers of the district.”",
        "[Importance of interpreters in Philippines.]  Interpreters are\nespecially indispensable in the Philippines, where the alcaldes never\nby any chance understand any of the local dialects. In important\nmatters the native writers have generally to deal with the priest,\nwho in many cases becomes the virtual administrator of authority. He is\nfamiliar with the characters of the inhabitants and all their affairs,\nin the settlement of which his intimate acquaintance with the female\nsex stands him in good stead. An eminent official in Madrid told me\nin 1867 that the then minister was considering a proposal to abolish\nthe restriction of office in the colonies to three years. [93]",
        "[Fear of officials’ popularity.] The dread which caused this\nrestriction, viz., that an official might become too powerful in some\ndistant province, and that his influence might prove a source of danger\nto the mother country, is no longer entertained. Increased traffic\nand easier means of communication have destroyed the former isolation\nof the more distant provinces. The customs laws, the increasing demand\nfor colonial produce, and the right conceded to foreigners of settling\nin the country, will give a great stimulus to agriculture and commerce,\nand largely increase the number of Chinese and European residents. Then\nat last, perhaps, the authorities will see the necessity of improving\nthe social position of their officials by decreasing their number,\nby a careful selection of persons, by promoting them according to\ntheir abilities and conduct, and by increasing their salaries, and\nallowing them to make a longer stay in one post. The commercial\nrelations of the Philippines with California and Australia are\nlikely to become very active, and liberal ideas will be introduced\nfrom those free countries. Then, indeed, the mother country will\nhave earnestly to consider whether it is advisable to continue its\nexploitation of the colony by its monopolies, its withdrawal of gold,\nand its constant satisfaction of the unfounded claims of a swarm of\nhungry place-hunters. [94]",
        "[Different English and Dutch policy.] English and Dutch colonial\nofficials are carefully and expressly educated for their difficult\nand responsible positions. They obtain their appointments after\npassing a stringent examination at home, and are promoted to the\nhigher colonial offices only after giving proofs of fitness and\nability. What a different state of things prevails in Spain! When a\nSpaniard succeeds in getting an appointment, it is difficult to say\nwhether it is due to his personal capacity and merit or to a series\nof successful political intrigues. [95]",
        "[Batu.] In an hour and a half after leaving Polangui we reached Batu,\na village on the north-western shore of the lake of the same name. The\ninhabitants, particularly the women, struck me by their ugliness\nand want of cleanliness. Although they lived close to the lake, and\ndrew their daily drinking water from it, they never appeared to use\nit for the purpose of washing. The streets of the village also were\ndirty and neglected; a circumstance explained, perhaps, by the fact\nof the priest being a native.",
        "[The lake.] Towards the end of the rainy season, in November, the\nlake extends far more widely than it does in the dry, and overflows\nits shallow banks, especially to the south-west. A great number of\nwater-plants grow on its borders; amongst which I particularly noticed\na delicate seaweed [96], as fine as horse hair, but intertwined in such\nclose and endless ramifications that it forms a flooring strong enough\nto support the largest waterfowl. I  saw hundreds of them hopping about\nand eating the shell fish and prawns, which swarmed amidst the meshes\nof the net-like seaweed and fell an easy prey to their feathered\nenemies. The natives, too, were in the habit of catching immense\nquantities of the prawns with nets made for the purpose. Some they\nate fresh; and some they kept till they were putrid, like old cheese,\nand then used them as a relish to swallow with their rice. These\nsmall shell-fish are not limited to the Lake of Batu. They are caught\nin shoals in both the salt and the fresh waters of the Philippine\nand Indian archipelagos, and, when salted and dried by the natives,\nform an important article of food, eaten either in soup or as a kind\nof potted paste. They are found in every market, and are largely\nexported to China. I was unable to shoot any of the waterfowl, for\nthe tangles of the seaweed prevented my boat from getting near them.",
        "[A neglected product.] When I revisited the same lake in February,\nI found its waters so greatly fallen that they had left a circular\nbelt of shore extending all around the lake, in most places nearly a\nhundred feet broad. The withdrawal of the waters had compressed the\ntangled seaweed into a kind of matting, which, bleached by the sun,\nand nearly an inch thick, covered the whole of the shore, and hung\nsuspended over the stunted bushes which, on my first visit, had\nbeen under water. I have never either seen elsewhere, or heard any\none mention, a similar phenomenon. This stuff, which could be had\nfor nothing, was excellent for rifle-stoppers and for the stuffing\nof birds, so I took a great quantity of it with me. This time the\nbird-hunting went well, too.",
        "The native priest of Batu was full of complaints about his\nparishioners, who gave him no opportunities of gaining an honest\npenny. “I am never asked for a mass, sir; in fact, this is such a\nmiserable hole that it is shunned by Death itself. In D., where I was\nfor a long time coadjutor, we had our couple of burials regularly\nevery day at three dollars a head, and as many masses at a dollar\napiece as we had time to say, besides christenings and weddings,\nwhich always brought a little more grist to the mill. But here\nnothing takes place, and I scarcely make anything.” This stagnant\nstate of things had induced him to turn his attention to commerce. The\naverage native priest, of those I saw, could hardly be called a credit\nto his profession. Generally ignorant, often dissipated, and only\nsuperficially acquainted with his duties, the greater part of his\ntime was given over to gambling, drinking, and other objectionable\namusements. Little care was taken to preserve a properly decorous\nbehavior, except when officiating in the church, when they read with\nan absurd assumption of dignity, without understanding a single\nword. The conventos are often full of girls and children, all of\nwhom help themselves with their fingers out of a common dish. The\nworthy padre of Batu introduced a couple of pretty girls to me as\nhis two poor sisters, whom, in spite of his poverty, he supported;\nbut the servants about the place openly spoke of these young ladies’\nbabies as being the children of the priest.",
        "[The native clergy.] The guiding principle of Spanish colonial\npolicy–to set one class against another, and to prevent either from\nbecoming too powerful–seems to be the motive for placing so many\nnative incumbents in the parsonages of the Archipelago. The prudence of\nthis proceeding, however, seems doubtful. A Spanish priest has a great\ndeal of influence in his own immediate circle, and forms, perhaps,\nthe only enduring link between the colony and the mother-country. The\nnative priest is far from affording any compensation for the lack\nof either of these advantages. He generally is but little respected\nby his flock, and certainly does nothing to attach them to Spain;\nfor he hates and envies his Spanish brethren, who leave him only the\nvery worst appointments, and treat him with contempt.",
        "[Nabua.] I rode from Batu to Nabua over a good road in half an\nhour. The country was flat, with rice-fields on both sides of the\nroad; but, while in Batu the rice was only just planted, in Nabua it\nalready was almost ripe. I was unable to obtain any explanation of\nthis incongruity, and know not how to account for such a difference\nof climate between two hamlets situated in such close proximity to\none another, and separated by no range of hills. The inhabitants of\nboth were ugly and dirty, and were different in these respects from\nthe Tagalogs. Nabua, a place of 10,875 inhabitants, is intersected by\nseveral small streams, whose waters, pouring down from the eastern\nhills, form a small lake, which empties itself into the river\nBicol. Just after passing the second bridge beyond Nabua the road,\ninclining eastwards, wends in a straight line to Iriga, a place lying\nto the south-west of the volcano of the same name.",
        "[Remontados.] I visited a small settlement of pagans situated on the\nslope of the volcano. The people of the plains call them indifferently\nIgorots, Cimarrons, Remontados, Infieles, or Montesinos. None\nof these names, however, with the exception of the two last, are\nappropriate ones. The first is derived from the term applied in the\nnorth of the Island to the mixed descendants of Chinese and Filipino\nparents. The word Cimarron (French, marrow) is borrowed from the\nAmerican slave colonies, where it denoted negroes who escaped from\nslavery and lived in a state of freedom; but here it is applied to\nnatives who prefer a wild existence to the comforts of village life,\nwhich they consider are overbalanced by the servitude and bondage\nwhich accompany them. The term Remontado explains itself, and has\nthe same signification as Cimarron. As the difference between the\ntwo states–on account of the mildness of the climate, and the\nease with which the wants of the natives are supplied–is far less\nthan it would be in Europe, these self-constituted exiles are more\nfrequently to be met with than might be supposed; the cause of their\nseparation from their fellowmen sometimes being some offence against\nthe laws, sometimes annoying debts, and sometimes a mere aversion to\nthe duties and labors of village life. Every Filipino has an innate\ninclination to abandon the hamlets and retire into the solitude of\nthe woods, or live isolated in the midst of his own fields; and it\nis only the village prisons and the priests–the salaries of the\nlatter are proportionate to the number of their parishioners–that\nprevent him from gradually turning the pueblos into visitas, [97]\nand the latter into ranchos. Until a visit to other ranchos in the\nneighborhood corrected my first impression, I took the inhabitants of\nthe slopes of the Iriga for cross-breeds between the low-landers and\nnegritos. The color of their skin was not black, but a dark brown,\nscarcely any darker than that of Filipinos who have been much exposed\nto the sun; and only a few of them had woolly hair. The negritos whom\nI saw at Angat and Mariveles knew nothing whatever about agriculture,\nlived in the open air, and supported themselves upon the spontaneous\nproducts of nature; but the half-savages of the Iriga dwell in decent\nhuts, and cultivate several vegetables and a little sugar-cane. No\npure negritos, as far as I could ascertain, are to be met with in\nCamarines. A thickly-populated province, only sparsely dotted with\nlofty hills, would be ill-suited for the residence of a nomadic\nhunting race ignorant of agriculture.",
        "[Iriga settlements.] The ranchos on the Iriga are very accessible,\nand their inhabitants carry on a friendly intercourse with the\nlowlanders; indeed, if they didn’t, they would have been long\nago exterminated. In spite of these neighborly communications,\nhowever, they have preserved many of their own primitive manners and\ncustoms. The men go about naked with the exception of a cloth about the\nloins; and the women are equally unclad, some of them perhaps wearing\nan apron reaching from the hip to the knee. [98] In the larger ranchos\nthe women were decently clad in the usual Filipino fashion. Their\nhousehold belongings consisted of a few articles made of bamboo, a\nfew calabashes of coconut-shell, and an earthen cooking-pot, and bows\nand arrows. [Poison arrows.] These latter are made very carefully,\nthe shaft from reeds, the point from a sharp-cut bamboo, or from a\npalm-tree, with one to three sharp points. In pig-hunting iron-pointed\npoison arrows are used. [Crucifixes.] Although the Igorots are not\nChristians, they decorate their huts with crucifixes, which they use\nas talismans. If they were of no virtue, an old man remarked to me, the\nSpaniards would not employ them so numerously. [99] The largest rancho\nI visited was nominally under the charge of a captain, who, however,\nhad little real power. At my desire he called to some naked boys idly\nsquatting about on the trees, who required considerable persuasion\nbefore they obeyed his summons; but a few small presents–brazen\nearrings and combs for the women, and cigars for the men–soon put\nme on capital terms with them.",
        "[Mt. Iriga.] After a vain attempt to reach the top of the Iriga volcano\nI started for Buhi, a place situated on the southern shore of the lake\nof that name. Ten minutes after leaving Iriga I reached a spot where\nthe ground sounded hollow beneath my horse’s feet. A succession of\nsmall hillocks, about fifty feet high, bordered each side of the road;\nand towards the north I could perceive the huge crater of the Iriga,\nwhich, in the distance, appeared like a truncated cone. I had the\ncuriosity to ascend one of the hillocks, which, seen from its summit,\nlooked like the remains of some former crater, which had probably\nbeen destroyed by an earthquake and split up into these small mounds.",
        "[Advertising.]  When I got to Buhi the friendly priest had it\nproclaimed by sound of drum that the newly-arrived strangers wished\nto obtain all kinds of animals, whether of earth, of air, or of water;\nand that each and all would be paid for in cash. The natives, however,\nonly brought us moths, centipedes, and other vermin, which, besides\nenabling them to have a good stare at the strangers, they hoped to\nturn into cash as extraordinary curiosities.",
        "[A church procession.]  The following day I was the spectator of a\ngorgeous procession. First came the Spanish flag, then the village\nkettle-drums, and a small troop of horsemen in short jackets and\nshirts flying in the wind, next a dozen musicians, and finally, as\nthe principal figure, a man carrying a crimson silk standard. The\nlatter individual evidently was deeply conscious of his dignified\nposition, and his countenance eloquently expressed the quantity of\npalm wine he had consumed in honor of the occasion. He sat on his\nhorse dressed out in the most absurd manner in a large cocked hat\ntrimmed with colored paper instead of gold lace, with a woman’s cape\nmade of paper outside his coat, and with short, tight-fitting yellow\nbreeches and immense white stockings and shoes. Both his coat and his\nbreeches were liberally ornamented with paper trimmings. His steed,\nled by a couple of cabezas, was appointed with similar trappings. After\nmarching through all the streets of the village the procession came\nto a halt in front of the church.",
        "[Papal concessions to Spain.] This festival is celebrated every year\nin commemoration of the concession made by the Pope to the King of\nSpain permitting the latter to appropriate to his own use certain\nrevenues of the Church. The Spanish Throne consequently enjoys the\nright of conferring different indulgences, even for serious crimes, in\nthe name of the Holy See. This right, which, so to speak, it acquired\nwholesale, it sells by retail to its customers (it formerly disposed\nof it to the priests) in the estanco, and together with its other\nmonopolies, such as tobacco, brandy, lottery tickets, stamped paper,\netc., all through the agency of the priests; without the assistance\nof whom very little business would be done. The receipts from the\nsale of these indulgences have always been very fluctuating. In 1819\nthey amounted to $15,930; in 1839 to $36,390; and in 1860 they were\nestimated at $58,954. In the year 1844-5 they rose to $292,115. The\ncause of this large increase was that indulgences were then rendered\ncompulsory; so many being alloted to each family, with the assistance\nand under the superintendence of the priests and tax-collectors who\nreceived a commission of five and eight per cent on the gross amount\ncollected. [100]",
        "[Lake Buhi.] The Lake of Buhi (300 feet above the sea-level) presents\nan extremely picturesque appearance, surrounded as it is on all sides\nby hills fully a thousand feet high; and its western shore is formed by\nwhat still remains of the Iriga volcano. I was informed by the priests\nof the neighboring hamlets that the volcano, until the commencement\nof the seventeenth century, had been a closed cone, and that the\nlake did not come into existence till half of the mountain fell in,\nat the time of its great eruption. This statement I found confirmed\nin the pages of the Estado Geografico:–\"On the fourth of January,\n1641–a memorable day, for on that date all the known volcanoes of\nthe Archipelago began to erupt at the same hour–a lofty hill in\nCamarines, inhabited by heathens, fell in, and a fine lake sprang\ninto existence upon its site. The then inhabitants of the village of\nBuhi migrated to the shores of the new lake, which, on this account,\nwas henceforward called the Lake of Buhi.”",
        "[1628 Camarines earthquake.] Perrey, in the Mémoires de l’Académie\nde Dijon, mentions another outbreak which took place in Camarines in\n1628: “In 1628, according to trustworthy reports, fourteen different\nshocks of earthquake occurred on the same day in the province of\nCamarines. Many buildings were thrown down, and from one large\nmountain which the earthquake rent asunder there issued such an\nimmense quantity of water that the whole neighborhood was flooded,\ntrees were torn up by the roots, and, in one hour, from the seashore\nall plains were covered with water (the direct distance to the shore\nis two and one-half leagues).  [101]",
        "[A mistranslation.] It is very strange that the text given in the\nfootnote does not agree with A. Perrey’s translation. The former does\nnot mention that water came out of the mountains and says just the\ncontrary, that trees, which were torn up by the roots, took the place\nof the sea for one hour on the shore, so that no water could be seen.",
        "[Unreliable authorities.] The data of the Estado Geografico are apt to\ncreate distrust as the official report on the great earthquake of 1641\ndescribes in detail the eruptions of three volcanoes, which happened at\nthe same time (of these two were in the South of the Archipelago and\none in Northern Luzon) while Camarines is not mentioned at all. This\nsuspicion is further strengthened by the fact that the same author\n(Nierembergius) whose remarks on the eruptions of 1628 in Camarines\nare quoted, gives in another book of his a detailed report on the\nevents of 1641 without mentioning this province. If one considers\nthe indifference of the friars toward such events in Nature, it is\nnot improbable that the eruptions of 1641 when a mountain fell in in\nNorthern Luzon and a lake took its place, has been transferred on the\nIriga. To illustrate the indifference it may be mentioned that even\nthe padres living at the foot of the Albay could not agree upon the\ndates of its very last eruptions.",
        "[Another attempt at mountain climbing.] When I was at Tambong, a small\nhamlet on the shore of the lake belonging to the parochial district\nof Buhi, I made a second unsuccessful attempt to reach the highest\npoint of the Iriga. We arrived in the evening at the southern point\nof the crater’s edge (1,041 meters above the level of the sea by my\nbarometrical observation), where a deep defile prevented our further\nprogress. Here the Igorots abandoned me, and the low-landers refused\nto bivouac in order to pursue the journey on the following day; so I\nwas obliged to return. Late in the evening, after passing through a\ncoco plantation, we reached the foot of the mountain and found shelter\nfrom a tempest with a kind old woman; to whom my servants lied so\nshamelessly that, when the rain had abated, we were, in spite of\nour failure, conducted with torches to Tambong, where we found the\npalm-grove round the little hamlet magically illuminated with bright\nbonfires of dry coconut-leaves in honor of the Conquistadores del\nIriga; and where I was obliged to remain for the night, as the people\nwere too timorous or too lazy to cross the rough water of the lake.",
        "[Pineapple fiber preparations.] Here I saw them preparing the fiber\nof the pine-apple for weaving. The fruit of the plants selected\nfor this purpose is generally removed early; a process which causes\nthe leaves to increase considerably both in length and in breadth. A\nwoman places a board on the ground, and upon it a pine-apple-leaf with\nthe hollow side upwards. Sitting at one end of the board, she holds\nthe leaf firmly with her toes, and scrapes its outersurface with a\npotsherd; not with the sharp fractured edge but with the blunt side\nof the rim; and thus the leaf is reduced to rags. In this manner a\nstratum of coarse longitudinal fiber is disclosed, and the operator,\nplacing her thumb-nail beneath it, lifts it up, and draws it away\nin a compact strip; after which she scrapes again until a second\nfine layer of fiber is laid bare. Then, turning the leaf round, she\nscrapes its back, which now lies upwards, down to the layer of fiber,\nwhich she seizes with her hand and draws at once, to its full length,\naway from the back of the leaf. When the fiber has been washed, it is\ndried in the sun. It is afterwards combed, with a suitable comb, like\nwomen’s hair, sorted into four classes, tied together, and treated like\nthe fiber of the lupi. In this crude manner are obtained the threads\nfor the celebrated web nipis de [Piña.] Piña, which is considered by\nexperts the finest in the world. Two shirts of this kind are in the\nBerlin Ethnographical Museum (Nos. 291 and 292). Better woven samples\nare in the Gewerbe Museum of Trade and Commerce. In the Philippines,\nwhere the fineness of the work is best understood and appreciated,\nrichly-embroidered costumes of this description have fetched more\nthan $1,400 each. [102]",
        "[Rain prevents another ascent.] At Buhi, which is not sufficiently\nsheltered towards the north-east, it rained almost as much as at\nDaraga. I had found out from the Igorots that a path could be forced\nthrough the tall canes up to the summit; but the continual rain\nprevented me; so I resolved to cross the Malinao, returning along the\ncoast to my quarters, and then, freshly equipped, descend the river\nBicol as far as Naga.",
        "[Mountaineers’ arrow poison.] Before we parted the Igorots prepared\nfor me some arrow poison from the bark of two trees. I happened\nto see neither the leaves nor the blossoms, but only the bark. A\npiece of bark was beaten to pieces, pressed dry, wetted, and again\npressed. This was done with the bare hand, which, however, sustained\nno injury. The juice thus extracted looked like pea-soup, and was\nwarmed in an earthen vessel over a slow fire. During the process it\ncoagulated at the edges; and the coagulated mass was again dissolved,\nby stirring it into the boiling fluid mass. When this had reached\nthe consistency of syrup, a small quantity was scraped off the inner\nsurface of a second piece of bark, and its juice squeezed into the\nvessel. This juice was a dark brown color. When the mass had attained\nthe consistency of a thin jelly, it was scraped out of the pot with\na chip and preserved on a leaf sprinkled with ashes. For poisoning\nan arrow they use a piece of the size of a hazel-nut, which, after\nbeing warmed, is distributed uniformly over the broad iron point;\nand the poisoned arrow serves for repeated use.",
        "[Sapa river.] At the end of November I left the beautiful lake of\nBuhi, and proceeded from its eastern angle for a short distance up\nthe little river Sapa [103], the alluvial deposits of which form\na considerable feature in the configuration of the lake. Across a\nmarshy meadow we reached the base of the Malinao or Buhi mountain,\nthe slippery clay of the lower slope merging higher up into volcanic\nsand. [Leeches.] The damp undergrowth swarmed with small leeches;\nI never before met with them in such numbers. These little animals,\nno stouter when streched out than a linen thread, are extraordinarily\nactive. They attach themselves firmly to every part of the body,\npenetrating even into the nose, the ears, and the eyelids, where,\nif, they remain unobserved, they gorge themselves to such excess that\nthey become as round as balls and look like small cherries. While they\nare sucking no pain is felt; but afterwards the spots attacked often\nitch the whole day long.  [104] [Fig-trees.] In one place the wood\nconsisted for the most part of fig-trees, with bunches of fruit quite\nsix feet in length hanging from the stems and the thicker branches;\nand between the trees grew ferns, aroids, and orchids. After nearly\nsix hours’ toil we reached the pass (841 meters above the sea level),\nand descended the eastern slope. The forest on the eastern side of\nthe mountain is still more magnificent than that on the west. From a\nclearing we obtained a fine view of the sea, the Island of Catanduanes,\nand the plain of Tabaco. [Prison as hotel.]  At sunset we reached Tibi,\nwhere I quartered myself in the prison. This, a tolerably clean place,\nenclosed with strong bamboos, was the most habitable part of a long\nshed which supplied the place of the tribunal destroyed in a storm two\nyears before. At Tibi I had an opportunity of sketching Mount Malinao\n(called also Buhi and Takit), which from this side has the appearance\nof a large volcano with a distinct crater. From the lake of Buhi it\nis not so clearly distinguishable.",
        "[Igabo hot spring.] Not far from Tibi, exactly north-east of Malinao,\nwe found a small hot spring called Igabo. In the middle of a plot of\nturf encircled by trees was a bare spot of oval form, nearly a hundred\npaces long and seventy wide. The whole space was covered with stones,\nrounded by attrition, as large as a man’s head and larger. Here\nand there hot water bubbled out of the ground and discharged into a\nlittle brook; beside it some women were engaged in cooking their food,\nwhich they suspended in nets in the hottest parts of the water. On the\nlower surfaces of some of the stones a little sulphur was sublimated;\nof alum hardly a trace was perceptible. In a cavity some caolin had\naccumulated, and was used as a stain.",
        "[Naglegbeng silicious springs.] From here I visited the stalactite\nsprings, not far distant, of Naglegbeng. [105] I had expected to\nsee a calcareous fountain, but found the most magnificent masses of\nsilica of infinite variety of form; shallow cones with cylindrical\nsummits, pyramidal flights of steps, round basins with ribbed margins,\nand ponds of boiling water. One spot, denuded of trees, from two\nto three hundred paces in breadth and about five hundred in length,\nwas, with the exception of a few places overgrown with turf, covered\nwith a crust of silicious dross, which here and there formed large\nconnected areas, but was generally broken up into flaky plates by the\nvertical springs which pierced it. In numerous localities boiling\nhot mineral water containing silica was forcing itself out of the\nground, spreading itself over the surface and depositing a crust,\nthe thickness of which depended on its distance from the center\npoint. In this manner, in the course of time, a very flat cone is\nformed, with a basin of boiling water in the middle. The continuous\ndeposit of dross contracts the channel, and a less quantity of water\noverflows, while that close to the edge of the basin evaporates and\ndeposits a quantity of fine silicious earth; whence the upper portion\nof the cone not only is steeper than its base, but frequently assumes\na more cylindrical form, the external surface of which on account\nof the want of uniformity in the overflow, is ribbed in the form\nof stalactites. When the channel becomes so much obstructed that\nthe efflux is less than the evaporation, the water ceases to flow\nover the edge, and the mineral dross, during the continual cooling\nof the water, is then deposited, with the greatest uniformity, over\nthe inner area of the basin. When, however, the surface of the water\nsinks, this formation ceases at the upper portion of the basin; the\ninterior wall thickens; and, if the channel be completely stopped up\nand all the water evaporated, there remains a bell-shaped basin as\neven as if excavated by the hand of man. The water now seeks a fresh\noutlet, and bursts forth where it meets with the least obstruction,\nwithout destroying the beautiful cone it has already erected. Many such\nexamples exist. In the largest cones, however, the vapors generated\nacquire such power that, when the outlet is completely stopped up,\nthey break up the overlying crust in concentrically radiating flakes;\nand the water, issuing anew copiously from the center, deposits a fresh\ncrust, which again, by the process we have just described is broken\nup into a superimposed layer of flakes. In this manner are formed\nannular layers, which in turn are gradually covered by fresh deposits\nfrom the overflowing water. After the pyramid of layers is complete\nand the outlet stopped up, the water sometimes breaks forth on the\nslope of the same cone; a second cone is then formed near the first,\non the same base. In the vicinity of the silicious springs are seen\ndeposits of white, yellow, red, and bluish-grey clays, overlaying\none another in narrow strata-like variegated marl, manifestly the\ndisintegrated produce of volcanic rocks transported hither by rain\nand stained with oxide of iron. These clays perhaps come from the\nsame rocks from the disintegration of which the silicious earth has\nbeen formed. Similar examples occur in Iceland and in New Zealand;\nbut the products of the springs of Tibi are more varied, finer,\nand more beautiful than those of the Iceland Geysers.",
        "[A world wonder.] The wonderful conformations of the red cone are\nindeed astonishing, and hardly to be paralleled in any other quarter\nof the world. [106]",
        "[Quinali river.] On my second journey in Camarines, which I undertook\nin February, I went by water from Polangui, past Batu, as far as\nNaga. The Quinali, which runs into the south-eastern corner of the\nlake of Batu, runs out again on the north side as the Bicol River,\nand flows in a north-westerly direction as far as the Bay of San\nMiguel. It forms the medium of a not inconsiderable trade between Albay\nand Camarines, particularly in rice; of which the supply grown in the\nformer province does not suffice for the population, who consume the\nsuperfluity of Camarines. The rice is conveyed in large boats up the\nriver as far as Quinali, and thence transported further on in carabao\ncarts; and the boats return empty. During the dry season of the year,\nthe breadth of the very tortuous Bicol, at its mouth, is a little over\nsixty feet, and increases but very gradually. There is considerable\nvariety of vegetation upon its banks, and in animal life it is highly\nattractive. I was particularly struck with its numerous monkeys and\nwater-fowl. [Plotus water-fowl.] Of the latter the Plotus variety\nwas most abundant, but difficult to shoot. They sit motionless on\nthe trees on the bank, only their thin heads and necks, like those\nof tree-snakes, overtopping the leaves. On the approach of the boat\nthey precipitate themselves hastily into the water; and it is not\nuntil after many minutes that the thin neck is seen rising up again\nat some distance from the spot where the bird disappeared. The Plotus\nappears to be as rapid on the wing as it is in swimming and diving.",
        "[Naga.] In Naga, the chief city of South Camarines, I alighted at\nthe tribunal, from which, however, I was immediately invited by the\nprincipal official of the district–who is famed for his hospitality\nfar beyond the limits of his province–to his house, where I was loaded\nwith civilities and favors. This universally beloved gentleman put\neverybody under contribution in order to enrich my collections, and did\nall in his power to render my stay agreeable and to further my designs.",
        "[Nueva Caceres.] Naga is the seat of a bishopric and of the provincial\ngovernment. In official documents it is called Nueva Caceres, in\nhonor of the Captain-General, D. Fr. de Sande, a native of Caceres,\nwho about 1578 founded Naga (the Spanish town) close to the Filipino\nvillage. At the beginning of the seventeenth century it numbered\nnearly one hundred Spanish inhabitants; at the present time it hardly\nboasts a dozen. Murillo Velarde remarks (xiii, 272), in contrast\nto the state of things in America, that of all the towns founded in\nthe Philippines, with the exception of Manila, only the skeletons,\nthe names without the substance, have been preserved. The reason is,\nas has been frequently shown, that up to the present time plantations,\nand consequently proper settlers, have been wanting. Formerly Naga\nwas the principal town of the whole of that district of Luzon lying\nto the east of Tayabas, which, on account of the increased population,\nwas divided into the three provinces of North and South Camarines and\nAlbay. The boundaries of these governmental districts, those between\nAlbay and South Camarines more especially, have been drawn very\narbitrarily; although, the whole of the territory, as is shown by the\nmap, geographically is very well defined. [Land of the Bicols.] The\ncountry is named Camarines; but it might more suitably be called the\ncountry of the Bicols, for the whole of it is inhabited by one race,\nthe Bicol-Filipinos, who are distinguished by their speech and many\nother peculiarities from their neighbors, the Tagals on the west,\nand the Bisayans on the islands to the south and east.",
        "[The Bicols.] The Bicols are found only in this district and in a\nfew islands lying immediately in front of it. Of their coming hither\nno information is to be obtained from the comprehensive but confused\nhistories of the Spanish monks. Morga considers them to be natives\nof the island; on the other hand, it is asserted by tradition that\nthe inhabitants of Manila and its vicinity are descended from Malays\nwho have migrated thither, and from the inhabitants of other islands\nand more distant provinces. [107] Their speech is midway between\nthat of the Tagalogs and the Bisayans, and they themselves appear,\nin both their manners and customs, to be a half-breed between these\ntwo races. Physically and mentally they are inferior to the Tagalogs,\nand superior to the inhabitants of the eastern Bisayan Islands. [Bicol\nlanguage.] Bicol is spoken only in the two Camarines, Albay, Luzon,\nthe Islands of Masbate, Burias, Ticao, and Catanduanes, and in the\nsmaller adjoining islands. The inhabitants of the volcanic mountain\nIsarog and its immediate neighborhood speak it in the greatest\npurity. Thence towards the west the Bicol dialect becomes more and\nmore like Tagalog, and towards the east like Bisayan, until by degrees,\neven before reaching the boundaries of their ethnographical districts,\nit merges into these two kindred languages.",
        "[Rice cultivation.] In South Camarines the sowing of the rice in\nbeds begins in June or July, always at the commencement of the rainy\nseason; but in fields artificially watered, earlier, because thus the\nfruit ripens at a time when, the store in the country being small,\nits price is high. Although the rice fields could very well give two\ncrops yearly, they are tilled only once. It is planted out in August,\nwith intervals of a hand’s-breadth between each row and each individual\nplant; and within four months the rice is ripe. The fields are never\nfertilized, and but seldom ploughed; the weeds and the stubble being\ngenerally trodden into the already soaked ground by a dozen carabaos,\nand the soil afterwards simply rolled with a cylinder furnished\nwith sharp points, or loosened with the harrow (sorod). Besides the\nagricultural implements named above, there are the Spanish hatchet\n(azadon) and a rake of bamboo (kag-kag) in use. The harvest is\neffected in a peculiar manner. The rice which is soonest ripe is\ncut for ten per cent, that is, the laborer receives for his toil the\ntenth bundle for himself. At this time of year rice is very scarce,\nwant is imminent, and labor reasonable. The more fields, however,\nthat ripen, the higher become the reapers’ wages, rising to twenty,\nthirty, forty, even fifty per cent; indeed, the executive sometimes\nconsider it to be necessary to force the people to do harvest by\ncorporal punishment and imprisonment, in order to prevent a large\nportion of the crop from rotting on the stalk. Nevertheless, in very\nfruitful years a part of the harvest is lost. The rice is cut halm by\nhalm (as in Java) with a peculiarly-formed knife, or, failing such,\nwith the sharp-edged flap of a mussel [108] found in the ditches of\nthe rice-fields, which one has only to stoop to pick up.",
        "[Rice land production.] A quiñon of the best rice land is worth from\nsixty to one hundred dollars ($5.50 to $9 per acre). Rice fields on\nrising grounds are dearest, as they are not exposed to devastating\nfloods as are those in the plain, and may be treated so as to insure\nthe ripening of the fruit at the time when the highest price is to\nbe obtained.",
        "[The harvest.] A ganta of rice is sufficient to plant four topones\n(1 topon = 1 loan); from which 100 manojos (bundles) are gathered,\neach of which yields half a ganta of rice. The old ganta of Naga,\nhowever, being equal to a modern ganta and a half, the produce\nmay be calculated at 75 cavanes per quiñon, about 9 3/4 bushels per\nacre. [109] In books 250 cavanes are usually stated to be the average\nproduce of a quiñon; but that is an exaggeration. The fertility of\nthe fields certainly varies very much; but, when it is considered\nthat the land in the Philippines is never fertilized, but depends,\nfor the maintenance of its vitality, exclusively upon the overflowing\nof the mud which is washed down from the mountains, it may be believed\nthat the first numbers better express the true average. In Java the\nharvest, in many provinces, amounts to only 50 cavanes per quiñon;\nin some, indeed, to three times this amount; and in China, with the\nmost careful culture and abundant manure, to 180 cabanes.  [110]\n[Sweet potatoes.]  Besides rice, they cultivate the camote (sweet\npotato, Convolvulus batatas). This flourishes like a weed; indeed,\nit is sometimes planted for the purpose of eradicating the weeds from\nsoil intended for coffee or cacao. It spreads out into a thick carpet,\nand is an inexhaustible storehouse to its owner, who, the whole year\nthrough, can supply his wants from his field. Gabi (Caladium), Ubi\n(Dioscorea), maize, and other kinds of grain, are likewise cultivated.",
        "[Cattle and horses.] After the rice harvest the carabaos, horses, and\nbullocks, are allowed to graze in the fields. During the rice culture\nthey remain in the gogonales, cane-fields which arise in places once\ncultivated for mountain-rice and afterwards abandoned. (Gogo is the\nname of a cane 7 to 8 feet high, Saccharum sp.). Transport then is\nalmost impossible, because during the rainy season the roads are\nimpassable, and the cattle find nothing to eat. The native does\nnot feed his beast, but allows it to die when it cannot support\nitself. In the wet season of the year it frequently happens that a\ncarabao falls down from starvation whilst drawing a cart. A carabao\ncosts from $7 to $10; a horse $10 to $20; and a cow $6 to $8. Very fine\nhorses are valued at from $30 to $50, and occasionally as much as $80;\nbut the native horses are not esteemed in Manila, because they have no\nstamina. The bad water, the bad hay, and the great heat of the place at\nonce point out the reason; otherwise it would be profitable to export\nhorses in favorable seasons to Manila, where they would fetch twice\ntheir value. According to Morga, there were neither horses nor asses\non the Island until the Spaniards imported them from China and New\nSpain. [111] They were at first small and vicious. Horses were imported\nalso from Japan, “not swift but powerful, with large heads and thick\nmanes, looking like Friesland horses;” [112] and the breed improved\nrapidly. Those born in the country, mostly cross-breeds, drive well.",
        "[Black cattle.] Black cattle are generally in the hands of a few\nindividuals; some of whom in Camarines possess from 1000 to 3000 head;\nbut they are hardly saleable in the province, although they have been\nexported profitably for some years past to Manila. The black cattle\nof the province are small but make good beef. They are never employed\nfor labor, and the cows are not milked. The Filipinos, who generally\nfeed on fish, crabs, mussels, and wild herbs together with rice,\nprefer the flesh of the carabao to that of the ox; but they eat it\nonly on feastdays.",
        "[Sheep.] The old race of sheep, imported by the Spaniards previous\nto this century, still flourishes and is easily propagated. Those\noccasionally brought from Shanghai and Australia are considered to be\ndeficient in endurance, unfruitful, and generally short-lived. Mutton\nis procurable every day in Manila; in the interior, however, at\nleast in the eastern provinces, very rarely; although the rearing\nof sheep might there be carried on without difficulty, and in many\nplaces most profitably; the people being too idle to take care of the\nyoung lambs, which they complain are torn to pieces by the dogs when\nthey wander about free. The sheep appear to have been acclimatized\nwith difficulty. Morga says that they were brought several times\nfrom New Spain, but did not multiply; so that in his time this kind\nof domestic animal did not exist. [Swine.] Pork is eaten by wealthy\nEuropeans only when the hog has been brought up from the litter at\nhome. In order to prevent its wandering away, it is usually enclosed\nin a wide meshed cylindrical hamper of bamboo, upon filling which\nit is slaughtered. The native hogs are too nauseous for food, the\nanimals maintaining themselves almost entirely on ordure.",
        "[Guesses at history from language.] Crawfurd observes that the names\nof all the domestic animals in the Philippines belong to foreign\nlanguages, Those of the dog, swine, goat, carabao, cat, even of\nthe fowl and the duck, are Malay or Javanese; while those of the\nhorse, ox, and sheep, are Spanish. Until these animals were first\nimported from Malaysia, the aborigines were less fortunate in this\nrespect than the Americans, who at least had the alpaca, llamanda,\nvicuña. The names likewise of most of the cultivated plants, such as\nrice, yams, sugar-cane, cacao and indigo, are said to be Malay, as\nwell as those for silver, copper, and tin. Of the words relating to\ncommerce, one-third are Malay; to which belong most of the terms used\nin trades, as well as the denominations for weights and measures, for\nthe calendar–so far as it exists–and for numbers, besides the words\nfor writing, reading, speaking, and narrative. On the other hand, only\na small number of terms which refer to war are borrowed from the Malay.",
        "[Ancient Filipino civilization.] Referring to the degree of\ncivilization which the Philippines possessed previous to their\nintercourse with the Malays, Crawfurd concludes from the purely\ndomestic words that they cultivated no corn, their vegetable food\nconsisting of batata(?) and banana. They had not a single domestic\nanimal; they were acquainted with iron and gold, but with no other\nmetal, and were clothed in stuffs of cotton and alpaca, woven by\nthemselves. They had invented a peculiar phonetic alphabet; and their\nreligion consisted in the belief in good and evil spirits and witches,\nin circumcision, and in somewhat of divination by the stars. They\ntherefore were superior to the inhabitants of the South Sea, inasmuch\nas they possessed gold, iron, and woven fabrics, and inferior to them\nin that they had neither dog, pig, nor fowl.",
        "[Progress under Spain.] Assuming the truth of the above sketch of\npre-Christian culture, which has been put together only with the help\nof defective linguistic sources, and comparing it with the present, we\nfind, as the result, a considerable progress, for which the Philippines\nare indebted to the Spaniards. The influence of social relations has\nbeen already exhibited in the text. The Spaniards have imported the\nhorse, the bullock, and the sheep; maize, coffee, sugar-cane, cacao,\nsesame, tobacco, indigo, many fruits, and probably the batata, which\nthey met with in Mexico under the name of camotli. [113] From this\ncircumstance the term camote, universal in the Philippines, appears\nto have had its origin, Crawfurd, indeed, erroneously considering\nit a native term. According to a communication from Dr. Witmack, the\nopinion has lately been conceived that the batata is indigenous not\nonly to America, but also to the East Indies, as it has two names in\nSanscrit, sharkarakanda and ruktaloo.",
        "[Slight industrial progress.] With the exception of embroidery, the\nnatives have made but little progress in industries, in the weaving\nand the plaiting of mats; and the handicrafts are entirely carried\non by the Chinese.",
        "[Rice and abaca exported.] The exports consist of rice and abaca. The\nprovince exports about twice as much rice as it consumes; a large\nquantity to Albay, which, less adapted for the cultivation of rice,\nproduces only abaca; and a fair share to North Camarines, which is\nvery mountainous, and little fertile. The rice can hardly be shipped\nto Manila, as there is no high road to the south side of the province,\nnear to the principal town, and the transport by water from the north\nside, and from the whole of the eastern portion of Luzon, would\nimmediately enhance the price of the product. [Chinese monopolize\ntrade.]  The imports are confined to the little that is imported by\nChinese traders. The traders are almost all Chinese who alone possess\nshops in which clothing materials and woolen stuffs, partly of native\nand partly of European manufacture, women’s embroidered slippers,\nand imitation jewelry, may be obtained. The whole amount of capital\ninvested in these shops certainly does not exceed $200,000. In the\nremaining pueblos of Camarines there are no Chinese merchants; and the\ninhabitants are consequently obliged to get their supplies from Naga.",
        "[Land for everybody.] The land belongs to the State, but is let to\nany one who will build upon it. The usufruct passes to the children,\nand ceases only when the land remains unemployed for two whole years;\nafter which it is competent for the executive to dispose of it to\nanother person.",
        "[Homes.] Every family possesses its own house; and the young husband\ngenerally builds with the assistance of his friends. In many places\nit does not cost more than four or five dollars, as he can, if\nnecessary, build it himself free of expense, with the simple aid of\nthe forest-knife (bolo), and of the materials to his hand, bamboo,\nSpanish cane, and palm-leaves. These houses, which are always built\non piles on account of the humidity of the soil, often consist of a\nsingle shed, which serves for all the uses of a dwelling, and are the\ncause of great laxity and of filthy habits, the whole family sleeping\ntherein in common, and every passer-by being a welcome guest. A fine\nhouse of boards for the family of a cabeza perhaps costs nearly $100;\nand the possessions of such a family in stock, furniture, ornaments,\netc. (of which they are obliged to furnish an annual inventory),\nwould range in value between $100 and $1,000. Some reach even as\nmuch as $10,000, while the richest family of the whole province is\nassessed at $40,000.",
        "[People not travellers.] In general it may be said that every pueblo\nsupplies travellers, its own necessaries, and produces little more. To\nthe indolent native, especially to him of the eastern provinces,\nthe village in which he was born is the world; and he leaves it only\nunder the most pressing circumstances. Were it otherwise even, the\nstrictness of the poll-tax would place great obstacles in the way of\ngratifying the desire for travel, generated by that oppressive impost.",
        "[Meals.] The Filipino eats three times a day–about 7 a.m., 12, and at\n7 or 8 in the evening. Those engaged in severe labor consume at each\nmeal a chupa of rice; the common people, half a chupa at breakfast, one\nat mid-day, and half again in the evening, altogether two chupas. Each\nfamily reaps its own supply of rice, and preserves it in barns, or\nbuys it winnowed at the market; in the latter case purchasing only\nthe quantity for one day or for the individual meals. The average\nretail price is 3 cuartos for 2 chupas (14 chupas for 1 real). To\nfree it from the husk, the quantity for each single meal is rubbed in\na mortar by the women. This is in accordance with an ancient custom;\nbut it is also due to the fear lest, otherwise, the store should be\ntoo quickly consumed. The rice, however, is but half cooked; and\nit would seem that this occurs in all places where it constitutes\nan essential part of the sustenance of the people, as may be seen,\nindeed, in Spain and Italy. Salt and much Spanish pepper (capsicum)\nare eaten as condiments; the latter, originally imported from America,\ngrowing all round the houses. To the common cooking-salt the natives\nprefer a so-called rock-salt, which they obtain by evaporation from\nsea-water previously filtered through ashes; and of which one chinanta\n(12 lbs. German) costs from one and one-half to two reals. The\nconsumption of salt is extremely small.",
        "[Buyo and cigars.] The luxuries of the Filipinos are buyo [114] and\ncigars–a cigar costing half a centavo, and a buyo much less. Cigars\nare rarely smoked, but are cut up into pieces, and chewed with the\nbuyo. The women also chew buyo and tobacco, but, as a rule, very\nmoderately; but they do not also stain their teeth black, like the\nMalays; and the young and pretty adorn themselves assiduously with\nveils made of the areca-nut tree, whose stiff and closely packed\nparallel fibers, when cut crosswise, form excellent tooth-brushes. They\nbathe several times daily, and surpass the majority of Europeans in\ncleanliness. Every native, above all things, keeps a fighting-cock;\neven when he has nothing to eat, he finds money for cock-fighting.",
        "[Household affairs.] The details of domestic economy may be summarized\nas follows:",
        "For cooking purposes an earthen pot is used, costing between 3 and 10\ncuartos; which, in cooking rice, is closed firmly with a banana-leaf,\nso that the steam of a very small quantity of water is sufficient. No\nother cooking utensils are used by the poorer classes; but those better\noff have a few cast-iron pans and dishes. In the smaller houses, the\nhearth consists of a portable earthen pan or a flat chest, frequently\nof an old cigar-* chest full of sand, with three stones which serve\nas a tripod. In the larger houses it is in the form of a bedstead,\nfilled with sand or ashes, instead of a mattress. The water in small\nhouseholds is carried and preserved in thick bamboos. In his bolo\n(forest-knife), moreover, every one has an universal instrument,\nwhich he carries in a wooden sheath made by himself, suspended by a\ncord of loosely-twisted bast fibers tied round his body. This, and\nthe rice-mortar (a block of wood with a suitable cavity), together\nwith pestles and a few baskets, constitute the whole of the household\n[Furniture.] furniture of a poor family; sometimes a large snail,\nwith a rush wick, is also to be found as a lamp. They sleep on a\nmat of pandanus (fan-palm, Corypha), when they possess one; if not,\non the splittings of bamboo, with which the house is floored. By the\npoor oil for lighting is rarely used; but torches of resin, which\nlast a couple of days, are bought in the market for half a cuarto.",
        "[Clothing.] Their clothing requirements I ascertained to be these:\nA woman wears a camisa de guinára (a short shift of abacá fiber),\na patadíon (a gown reaching from the hip to the ancles), a cloth,\nand a comb. A piece of guinára, costing 1 real, gives two shifts;\nthe coarsest patadíon costs 3 reals; a cloth, at the highest, 1 real;\nand a comb, 2 cuartos; making altogether 4 reals, 12 cuartos. Women of\nthe better class wear a camisa, costing between 1 and 2 r., a patadíon\n6 r., cloth between 2 and 3 r., and a comb 2 cu. The men wear a shirt,\n1 r., hose, 3 r., hat (tararura) of Spanish cane, 10 cu., or a salacot\n(a large rain-hat, frequently decorated), at least 2 r.–often,\nwhen ornamented with silver, as much as $50. At least three, but more\ncommonly four, suits are worn out yearly; the women, however, taking\ncare to weave almost the whole quantity for the family themselves.",
        "[Wages.] The daily wages of the common laborer are 1 real, without\nfood; and his hours of work are from 6 to 12, and from 2 to 6\no’clock. The women, as a rule, perform no field labor, but plant out\nthe rice and assist in the reaping; their wages on both occasions\nbeing equal to those of the men. Wood and stone-cutters receive 1.5\nr. per day, and calkers 1.75 r.",
        "[Land leases.] The Tercio is a pretty general contract in the\ncultivation of the land. The owner simply lets arable land for the\nthird part of the crop. Some mestizos possess several pieces of ground;\nbut they are seldom connected together, as they generally acquire\nthem as mortgages for sums bearing but a small proportion to their\nreal value.",
        "[Family income.] Under the head of earnings I give the income of a\nsmall family. The man earns daily one real, and the woman, if she\nweaves coarse stuff, one-fourth real, and her food (thus a piece\nof guinára, occupying the labor of two days, costs half a real in\nweavers’ wages). The most skilful female weaver of the finer stuffs\nobtains twelve reals per piece; but it takes a month to weave; and\nthe month, on account of the numerous holy-days, must be calculated\nat the most as equal to twenty-four working days; she consequently\nearns one-fourth real per day and her food. For the knitting of the\nfibers of the ananas for the piña web (called sugot) she gets only\nan eighth of a real and her food.",
        "[Schools.] In all the pueblos there are schools. The schoolmaster\nis paid by the Government, and generally obtains two dollars per\nmonth, without board or lodging. In large pueblos the salary amounts\nto three dollars and a half; out of which an assistant must be\npaid. The schools are under the supervision of the ecclesiastics\nof the place. Reading and writing are taught, the writing copies\nbeing Spanish. The teacher, who has to teach his scholars Spanish\nexactly, does not understand it himself, while the Spanish officers,\non the other hand, do not understand the language of the country;\nand the priests have no inclination to alter this state of things,\nwhich is very useful to them as a means of influence. Almost the only\nFilipinos who speak Spanish are those who have been in the service\nof Europeans. A kind of religious horn-book is the first that is\nread in the language of the country (Bicol); and after that comes the\nChristian Doctrine, the reading-book called Casayayan. On an average,\nhalf of all the children go to school, generally from the seventh\nto the tenth year. They learn to read a little; a few even write a\nlittle: but they soon forget it again. Only those who are afterwards\nemployed as clerks write fluently; and of these most write well.",
        "Some priests do not permit boys and girls to attend the same school;\nand in this case they pay a second teacher, a female, a dollar a\nmonth. The Filipinos learn arithmetic very quickly, generally aiding\nthemselves by the use of mussels or stones, which they pile in little\nheaps before them and then count through.",
        "[Marriage age.] The women seldom marry before the fourteenth year,\ntwelve years being the legal limit. In the church-register of Polángui\nI found a marriage recorded (January, 1837) between a Filipino and a\nFilipina having the ominous name of Hilaria Concepción, who at the\ntime of the performance of the marriage ceremony was, according to\na note in the margin, only nine years and ten months old. Frequently\npeople live together unmarried, because they cannot pay the expenses\nof the ceremony. [115]",
        "[Woman’s work.] European females, and even mestizas, never seek\nhusbands amongst the natives. The women generally are well treated,\ndoing only light work, such as sewing, weaving, embroidery, and\nmanaging the household; while all the heavy labor, with the exception\nof the beating of the rice, falls to the men. [116]",
        "[A patriarch.] Instances of longevity are frequent amongst the\nFilipinos, particularly in Camarines. The Diario de Manila, of\nMarch 13th, 1866, mentions an old man in Darága (Albay) whom I knew\nwell–Juan Jacob, born in 1744, married in 1764, and a widower\nin 1845. He held many public posts up to 1840, and had thirteen\nchildren, of whom five are living. He has one hundred and seventy\ndirect descendants, and now, at one hundred and twenty-two years of\nage, is still vigorous, with good eyes and teeth. Extreme unction\nwas administered to him seven times!",
        "[Snake bite and rabies remedy.] The first excretion of a new-born\nchild is carefully preserved, and under the name of triaca (theriacum)\nis held to be a highly efficacious and universal remedy for the bites\nof snakes and mad dogs. It is applied to the wound externally, and\nat the same time is taken internally.",
        "[Infant mortality.] A large number of children die in the first two\nweeks after birth. Statistical data are wanting; but, according to the\nopinion of one of the first physicians in Manila, at least one-fourth\ndie. This mortality must arise from great uncleanliness and impure air;\nsince in the chambers of the sick, and of women lying-in, the doors\nand windows are so closely shut that the healthy become sick from\nthe stench and heat, and the sick recover with difficulty. Every\naperture of the house is closed up by the husband early during\ntravail, in order that Patianac may not break in–an evil spirit\nwho brings mischief to lying-in women, and endeavors to hinder the\nbirth. The custom has been further maintained even amongst many\nwho attach no belief to the superstition, but who, from fear of a\ndraught of air through a hole, have discovered a new explanation for\nan old custom–namely, that instances of such practices occur amongst\nall people. [The itch.] One very widely-spread malady is the itch,\nalthough, according to the assurance of the physician above referred\nto, it may be easily subdued; and, according to the judgment of those\nwho are not physicians and who employ that term for any eruptions\nof the skin, the natives generally live on much too low a diet; the\nBicols even more than the Tagalogs. [117] Under certain conditions,\nwhich the physicians, on being questioned, could not define more\nprecisely, the natives can support neither hunger nor thirst; of which\nfact I have on many occasions been a witness. It is reported of them,\nwhen forced into such a situation as to suffer from unappeased wants,\nthat they become critically ill; and thus they often die.",
        "[Imitation mania.] Hence arises the morbid mania for imitation,\nwhich is called in Java Sakit-latar, and here Mali-mali. In Java many\nbelieve that the sickness is only assumed, because those who pretend\nto be afflicted with it find it to their advantage to be seen by newly\narrived Europeans. Here, however, I saw one instance where indeed no\nsimulation could be suspected. My companions availed themselves of\nthe diseased condition of a poor old woman who met us in the highway,\nto practice some rough jokes upon her. The old woman imitated every\nmotion as if impelled by an irresistible impulse, and expressed at\nthe same time the most extreme indignation against those who abused\nher infirmity.",
        "[The sickness in Siberia.] In R. Maak’s “Journey to the Amour,” it is\nrecorded:–\"It is not unusual for the Maniagri to suffer also from a\nnervous malady of the most peculiar kind, with which we had already\nbeen made acquainted by the descriptions of several travellers. [118]\nThis malady is met with, for the most part, amongst the wild people\nof Siberia, as well as amongst the Russians settled there. In the\ndistrict of the Jakutes, where this affliction very frequently occurs,\nthose affected by it, both Russians and Jakutes, are known by the\nname of ’Emiura;’ but here (that is, in that part of Siberia where\nthe Maniagri live) the same malady is called by the Maniagri ’Olon,’\nand by the Argurian Cossacks ’Olgandshi.’ The attacks of the malady\nwhich I am now mentioning consist in this, that a man suffering\nfrom it will, if under the influence of terror or consternation,\nunconsciously, and often without the smallest sense of shame, imitate\neverything that passes before him. Should he be offended, he falls\ninto a rage, which manifests itself by wild shrieks and raving;\nand he precipitates himself at the same time, with a knife or any\nother object which may fall to his hand, upon those who have placed\nhim in this predicament. Amongst the Maniagri, women, especially the\nvery aged, are the chief sufferers from this malady; and instances,\nmoreover, of men who were affected by it are likewise known to me. It\nis worthy of remark that those women who returned home on account of\nthis sickness were notwithstanding strong, and in all other respects\nenjoyed good health.”",
        "[Running amuck.] Probably it is only an accidental coincidence that\nin the Malay countries Sakit-latar and Amok exist together, if not in\nthe same individual, yet amongst the same people. Instances of Amok\nseem to occur also in the Philippines.  [119] I find the following\naccount in the Diario de Manila of February 21, 1866: In Cavite,\non February 18, a soldier rushed into the house of a school-teacher,\nand, struggling with him, stabbed him with a dagger, and then killed\nthe teacher’s son with a second stab. Plunging into the street, he\nstabbed two young girls of ten and twelve years of age and wounded a\nwoman in the side, a boy aged nine in the arm, a coachman (mortally) in\nthe abdomen, and, besides another woman, a sailor and three soldiers;\nand arriving at his barracks, where he was stopped by the sentry,\nhe plunged the dagger into his own breast.",
        "[Regard for the sleeping.] It is one of the greatest insults to stride\nover a sleeping native, or to awaken him suddenly. They rouse one\nanother, when necessity requires, with the greatest circumspection\nand by the slowest degrees. [120]",
        "[Sense of smell.] The sense of smell is developed amongst the\nnatives to so great a degree that they are able, by smelling at the\npocket-handkerchiefs, to tell to which persons they belong (\"Reisesk.,\"\np. 39); and lovers at parting exchange pieces of the linen they may\nbe wearing, and during their separation inhale the odor of the beloved\nbeing, besides smothering the relics with kisses. [121]",
        "[A scientific priest-poet.] From Naga I visited the parish priest\nof Libmanan (Ligmanan), who, possessing poetical talent, and having\nthe reputation of a natural philosopher, collected and named pretty\nbeetles and shells, and dedicated the most elegant little sonnets. He\nfavored me with the following narrative:–",
        "[Prehistoric remains] In 1851, during the construction of a road a\nlittle beyond Libmanan, at a place called Poro, a bed of shells was\ndug up under four feet of mould, one hundred feet distant from the\nriver. It consisted of Cyrenae (C. suborbicularis, Busch.), a species\nof bivalve belonging to the family of Cyclades which occurs only in\nwarm waters, and is extraordinarily abundant in the brackish waters of\nthe Philippines. On the same occasion, at the depth of from one and\na half to three and a half feet, were found numerous remains of the\nearly inhabitants–skulls, ribs, bones of men and animals, a child’s\nthighbone inserted in a spiral of brass wire, several stags’ horns,\nbeautifully-formed dishes and vessels, some of them painted, probably\nof Chinese origin; striped bracelets, of a soft, gypseous, copper-red\nrock, gleaming as if they were varnished; [122] small copper knives,\nbut no iron utensils; and several broad flat stones bored through\nthe middle; [123] besides a wedge of petrified wood, embedded in a\ncleft branch of a tree. The place, which to this day may be easily\nrecognized in a hollow, might, by excavation systematically carried on,\nyield many more interesting results. What was not immediately useful\nwas then and there destroyed, and the remainder dispersed. In spite of\nevery endeavor, I could obtain, through the kindness of Señor Fociños\nin Naga, only one small vessel. Similar remains of more primitive\ninhabitants have been found at the mouth of the Bigajo, not far from\nLibmánan, in a shell-bed of the same kind; and an urn, with a human\nskeleton, was found at the mouth of the Perlos, west of Sitio de Poro,\nin 1840. At the time when I wrote down these statements of the priest,\nneither of us was familiar with the discoveries made within the last\nfew years relating to the lake dwellings (pile villages); or these\nnotes might have been more exact, although probably they would not\nhave been so easy and natural.",
        "[Ancient Chinese jar.] Mr. W. A. Franks, who had the kindness to\nexamine the vessel, inclines to the opinion that it is Chinese, and\npronounces it to be of very great antiquity, without however, being\nable to determine its age more exactly; and a learned Chinese of the\nBurlingame Embassy expressed himself to the same effect. He knew only\nof one article, now in the British Museum, which was brought from Japan\nby Kaempfer, the color, glazing, and cracks in the glazing, of which\n(craqueles) corresponded precisely with mine. According to Kaempfer,\nthe Japanese found similar vessels in the sea; and they value them\nvery highly for the purpose of preserving their tea in them.",
        "Morga writes:–",
        "[Used as tea canisters.]  “On this island, Luzon, particularly in\nthe provinces of Manila, Pampánga, Pangasinán, and Ilócos, very\nancient clay vessels of a dark brown color are found by the natives,\nof a sorry appearance; some of a middling size, and others smaller;\nmarked with characters and stamps. They are unable to say either when\nor where they obtained them; but they are no longer to be acquired, nor\nare they manufactured in the islands. The Japanese prize them highly,\nfor they have found that the root of a herb which they call Tscha\n(tea), and which when drunk hot is considered as a great delicacy\nand of medicinal efficacy by the kings and lords in Japan, cannot be\neffectively preserved except in these vessels; which are so highly\nesteemed all over Japan that they form the most costly articles of\ntheir show-rooms and cabinets. Indeed, so highly do they value them\nthat they overlay them externally with fine gold embossed with great\nskill, and enclose them in cases of brocade; and some of these vessels\nare valued at and fetch from two thousand tael to eleven reals. The\nnatives of these islands purchase them from the Japanese at very high\nrates, and take much pains in the search for them on account of their\nvalue, though but few are now found on account of the eagerness with\nwhich they have been sought for.”",
        "[Strict search in Japan.] When Carletti, in 1597, went from the\nPhilippines to Japan, all the passengers on board were examined\ncarefully, by order of the governor, and threatened with capital\npunishment if they endeavored to conceal “certain earthen vessels\nwhich were wont to be brought from the Philippines and other islands\nof that sea,” as the king wished to buy them all.",
        "[Prized by Japanese.] “These vessels were worth as much as five,\nsix, and even ten thousand scudi each; but they were not permitted\nto demand for them more then one Giulio (about a half Paolo).” In\n1615 Carletti met with a Franciscan who was sent as ambassador from\nJapan to Rome, who assured him that he had seen one hundred and\nthirty thousand scudi paid by the King of Japan for such a vessel;\nand his companions confirmed the statement. Carletti also alleges,\nas the reason for the high price, “that the leaf cia or tea, the\nquality of which improves with age, is preserved better in those\nvessels than in all others. The Japanese besides know these vessels by\ncertain characters and stamps. They are of great age and very rare,\nand come only from Cambodia, Siam, Cochin-China, the Philippines,\nand other neighboring islands. From their external appearance they\nwould be estimated at three or four quatrini (two dreier).... It is\nperfectly true that the king and the princes of that kingdom possess\na very large number of these vessels, and prize them as their most\nvaluable treasure and above all other rarities .... and that they boast\nof their acquisitions, and from motives of vanity strive to outvie one\nanother in the multitude of pretty vessels which they possess. [124]",
        "[Found in Borneo.] Many travellers mention vessels found likewise\namongst the Dyaks and the Malays in Borneo, which, from superstitious\nmotives, were estimated at most exaggerated figures, amounting\nsometimes to many thousand dollars.",
        "[$3,500 for a jar] St. John [125] relates that the Datu of Tamparuli\n(Borneo) gave rice to the value of almost $3,500 for a jar, and that he\npossessed a second jar of almost fabulous value, which was about two\nfeet high, and of a dark olive green. The Datu fills both jars with\nwater, which, after adding plants and flowers to it, he dispenses\n[A speaking jar.] to all the sick persons in the country. But the\nmost famous jar in Borneo is that of the Sultan of Brunei, which\nnot only possesses all the valuable properties of the other jars\nbut can also speak. St. John did not see it, as it is always kept\nin the women’s apartment; but the sultan, a credible man, related to\nhim that the jar howled dolefully the night before the death of his\nfirst wife, and that it emitted similar tones in the event of impending\nmisfortunes. St. John is inclined to explain the mysterious phenomenon\nby a probably peculiar form of the mouth of the vessel, in passing over\nwhich the air-draught is thrown into resonant verberations, like the\nAeolian harp. The vessel is generally enveloped in gold brocade, and\nis uncovered only when it is to be consulted; and hence, of course,\nit happens that it speaks only on solemn occasions. St. John states\nfurther that the Bisayans used formerly to bring presents to the\nsultan; in recognition of which they received some water from the\nsacred jar to sprinkle over their fields and thereby ensure plentiful\nharvests. When the sultan was asked whether he would sell his jar for\n$100,000, he answered that no offer in the world could tempt him to\npart with it.",
        "[Morga’s description.] Morga’s description suits neither the vessel\nof Libmánan nor the jar of the British Museum, but rather a vessel\nbrought from Japan a short time ago to our Ethnographical Museum. This\nis of brown clay, small but of graceful shape, and composed of many\npieces cemented together; the joints being gilt and forming a kind of\nnetwork on the dark ground. How highly ancient pots of a similar kind,\neven of native origin, are esteemed in Japan down to the present day,\nis shown by the following certificate translated by the interpreter\nof the German Consulate:–",
        "[A consecrated jar.] “This earthen vessel was found in the porcelain\nfactory of Tschisuka in the province of Odori, in South Idzumi,\nand is an object belonging to the thousand graves.... It was made\nby Giogiboosat (a celebrated Buddhist priest), and after it had been\nconsecrated to heaven was buried by him. According to the traditions\nof the people, this place held grave mounds with memorial stones. That\nis more than a thousand years ago. ....In the pursuit of my studies,\nI remained many years in the temple Sookuk, of that village, and\nfound the vessel. I carried it to the high priest Shakudjo, who\nwas much delighted therewith and always bore it about with him as\na treasure. When he died it fell to me, although I could not find\nit. Recently, when Honkai was chief priest, I saw it again, and\nit was as if I had again met the spirit of Shakudjo. Great was my\ncommotion, and I clapped my hands with astonishment; and, as often\nas I look upon the treasure, I think it is a sign that the spirit of\nShakudjo is returned to life. Therefore I have written the history,\nand taken care, of this treasure.–Fudji Kuz Dodjin.”",
        "Baron Alexander von Siebold communicates the following:–",
        "[Tea societies.] The value which the Japanese attach to vessels of this\nkind rests upon the use which is made of them by the mysterious tea\nsocieties called Cha-no-yu. Respecting the origin of these societies,\nwhich still are almost entirely unknown to Europeans, different legends\nexist. They flourished, however, principally during the reign of the\nemperor Taikosama, who, in the year 1588, furnished the society of\nCha-no-yu at Kitano near Myako with new laws. In consequence of the\nreligious and civil wars, the whole of the people had deteriorated\nand become ungovernable, having lost all taste for art and knowledge,\nand holding only rude force in any esteem; brute strength ruling in the\nplace of the laws. The observant Taikosama perceived that, in order to\ntame these rough natures, he must accustom them to the arts of peace,\nand thus secure prosperity to the country, and safety for himself and\nhis successors. With this in view he recalled the Cha-no-yu society\nanew into life, and assembled its masters and those acquainted with\nits customs around him.",
        "[Their object.] The object of the Cha-no-yu is to draw man away\nfrom the influences of the terrestrial forces which surround him,\nto plant within him the feeling of complete repose, and to dispose\nhim to self-contemplation. All the exercises of the Cha-no-yu are\ndirected to this object.",
        "[Ceremonies.] Clothed in light white garments, and without weapons,\nthe members of the Cha-no-yu assemble round the master’s house, and,\nafter resting some time in the ante-room, are conducted into a pavilion\nappropriated exclusively to these assemblies. This consists of the\nmost costly kinds of wood, but is without any ornament which could\npossibly be abstracted from it; without color, and without varnish,\ndimly lighted by small windows thickly overgrown with plants, and\nso low that it is impossible to stand upright. The guests tread the\napartment with solemn measured steps, and, having been received by\nhim according to the prescribed formulas, arrange themselves in\na half-circle on both sides of him. All distinctions of rank are\nabolished. The ancient vessels are now removed with solemn ceremonies\nfrom their wrappings, saluted and admired; and, with the same solemn\nand rigidly prescribed formulas, the water is heated on the hearth\nappropriated to the purpose, and the tea taken from the vessels and\nprepared in cups. The tea consists of the young green leaves of the\ntea-shrub rubbed to powder, and is very stimulating in its effect. The\nbeverage is taken amidst deep silence, while incense is burning on\nthe elevated pedestal of honor, toko; and, after the thoughts have\nthus been collected, conversation begins. It is confined to abstract\nsubjects; but politics are not always excluded.",
        "[Reward of valor.] The value of the vessels employed in these\nassemblages is very considerable; indeed, they do not fall short of the\nvalue of our most costly paintings; and Taikosama often rewarded his\ngenerals with vessels of the kind, instead of land, as was formerly the\npractice. After the last revolution some of the more eminent Daimios\n(princes) of the Mikado were rewarded with similar Cha-no-yu vessels,\nin acknowledgment of the aid rendered to him in regaining the throne\nof his ancestors. The best of them which I have seen were far from\nbeautiful, simply being old, weather-worn, black or dark-brown jars,\nwith pretty broad necks, for storing the tea in; tall cups of cracked\nCraquelé, either porcelain or earthenware, for drinking the infusion;\nand deep, broad cisterns; besides rusty old iron kettles with rings,\nfor heating the water: but they were enwrapped in the most costly\nsilken stuffs, and preserved in chests lacquered with gold. Similar\nold vessels are preserved amongst the treasures of the Mikado and the\nTycoon, as well as in some of the temples, with all the care due to the\nmost costly jewels, together with documents relating to their history.",
        "[Yamtik and Visita Bicul.]  From Libmánan I visited the mountain,\nYamtik (Amtik, Hantu), [126] which consists of lime, and contains\nmany caverns. Six hours westward by water, and one hour S.S.W. on\nfoot, brought us to the Visita Bícul, surrounded by a thousand little\nlimestone hills; from which we ascended by a staircase of sinter in the\nbed of a brook, to a small cavern tenanted by multitudes of bats, and\ngreat long-armed spiders of the species Phrynus, known to be poisonous.\n[127]",
        "[Ant activities.] A thick branch of a tree lying across the road was\nperforated from end to end by a small ant. Many of the natives did\nnot venture to enter the cave; and those who did enter it were in a\nstate of great agitation, and were careful first to enjoin upon each\nother the respect to be observed by them towards Calapnitan.  [128]",
        "[Superstitions.] One of the principal rules was to name no object in\nthe cave without adding “Lord Calapnitan’s.” Thus they did not bluntly\nrefer to either gun or torch, but devoutly said “Lord C.’s gun,” or\n\"Lord C.’s torch.” At a thousand paces from this lies another cave,\n\"San Vicente,” which contains the same insects, but another kind\nof bat. Both caves are only of small extent; but in Libmánan a very\nlarge stalactite cave was mentioned to me, the description of which,\nnotwithstanding the fables mixed up with it, could not but have a true\nfoundation. Our guides feigned ignorance of it; and it was not till\nafter two days’ wandering about, and after many debates, that they came\nto the decision, since I adhered to my purpose, to encounter the risk;\nwhen, to my great astonishment, they conducted me back to Calapnitan’s\ncave; from which a narrow fissure, hidden by a projection of rock,\nled into one of the most gorgeous stalactite caves in the world. Its\nfloor was everywhere firm and easy to the tread, and mostly dry; and\nit ran out into several branches, the entire length of which probably\nexceeds a mile; and the whole series of royal chambers and cathedrals,\nwith the columns, pulpits, and altars which it contained, reflected\nno discredit upon its description. No bones or other remains were to\nbe found in it. My intention to return subsequently with laborers,\nfor the purpose of systematic excavation, was not carried out.",
        "[Unsuccessful climb.] I was not lucky enough to reach the summit of the\nmountain, upon which was to be found a lake, “from where else should\nthe water come?” For two days we labored strenuously at different\npoints to penetrate the thick forest; but the guide, who had assured\nthe priest in Libmanan that he knew the road, now expressed himself\nto the contrary effect. I therefore made the fellow, who had hitherto\nbeen unburdened, now carry a part of the baggage as a punishment;\nbut he threw it off at the next turning of the road and escaped,\nso that we were compelled to return. Stags and wild boars are very\nnumerous in these forests; and they formed the principal portion of\nour meals, at which, at the commencement of our expedition, we had\nas many as thirty individuals; who, in the intervals between them,\naffected to search for snails and insects for me, but with success\nnot proportionate to their zeal.",
        "[A clever pilfering servant.] Upon my departure from Daraga I took\nwith me a lively little boy, who had a taste for the calling of a\nnaturalist. In Libmanan he was suddenly lost, and with him, at the\nsame time, a bundle of keys; and we looked for him in vain. The\nfact was, as I afterwards came to learn, that he went straight to\nNaga, and, identifying himself by showing the stolen keys, got the\nmajordomo of my host to deliver to him a white felt hat; with which he\ndisappeared. I had once seen him, with the hat on his head, standing\nbefore a looking-glass and admiring himself; and he could not resist\nthe temptation to steal it.",
        "[Trip with Internal Revenue Collector.] In the beginning of March\nI had the pleasure of accompanying the Collector (Administrador) of\nCamarines and a Spanish head-man, who were travelling across Daet and\nMauban to the chief town. At five p.m. we left Butungan on the Bicol\nRiver, two leagues below Naga, in a falúa of twelve oars, equipped\nwith one 6-pounder and two 4-pounders, and reinforced by armed men;\nand about six we reached Cabusao, at the mouth of the Bicol, whence we\nput to sea about nine. The falua belonged to the collector of taxes,\nand had, in conjunction with another under the command of the alcalde,\nto protect the north coast of the province against smugglers and\npirates, who at this time of the year are accustomed to frequent\nthe hiding-places of the bay of San Miguel. Two similar gun-boats\nperformed the duty on the south coast of the province.",
        "[Four volcanos.] Both the banks of the Bicol River are flat, and\nexpand into broad fields of rice; and to the east are simultaneously\nvisible the beautiful volcanos of Mayon, Iriga, Malina, and Isarog.",
        "At daybreak we reached the bar of Daet, and, after two hours’\ntravelling, the similarly named chief city of the province of North\nCamarines, where we found an excellent reception at the house of\nthe alcalde, a polished Navarrese; marred only by the tame monkey,\nwho should have welcomed the guests of his master, turning his\nback towards them with studiously discourteous gestures, and going\ntowards the door. However, upon the majordomo placing a spirit flask\npreserving a small harmless snake on the threshold, the monkey sprang\nquickly back and concealed himself, trembling, behind his master. [A\ndanceless ball.] In the evening there was a ball, but there were no\ndancers present. Some Filipinas, who had been invited, sat bashfully\nat one end of the apartment and danced with one another when called\nupon, without being noticed by the Spaniards, who conversed together\nat the other end.",
        "[Spanish prejudice against bathing.] Our departure hence was delayed\nby festivities and sudden showers for about two days, after which the\nspirited horses of the alcalde carried us within an hour on a level\nroad north-west, to Talisáy, and in another hour to Indang, where\na bath and breakfast were ready. Up to this time I had never seen\na bath-room in the house of a Spaniard; whereas with the Northern\nEuropeans it is never wanting. The Spaniards appear to regard\nthe bath as a species of medicine, to be used only with caution;\nmany, even to the present day, look upon it as an institution not\nquite Christian. At the time of the Inquisition frequent bathing,\nit is known, was a characteristic of the Moors, and certainly was not\nwholly free from danger. In Manila, only those who live near the Pasig\nare the exceptions to the rule; and there the good or bad practice\nprevails of whole families bathing, in the company of their friends,\nin the open air.",
        "[An unfortified fort.] The road ends at Indáng. In two boats we went\ndown the river till stopped by a bar, and there at a well-supplied\ntable prepared for us by the kindness of the alcalde we awaited\nthe horses which were being brought thither along a bad road by our\nservants. In the waste of Barre a tower, surrounded by two or three\nfishermen’s huts and as many camarines, has been erected against the\nMoros, who, untempted by the same, seldom go so far westward, for\nit consists only of an open hut covered with palm-leaves–a kind of\nparasol–supported on stakes as thick as one’s arm and fifteen feet\nhigh; and the two cannons belonging to it ought, for security, to be\nburied. We followed the sea-shore, which is composed of silicious sand,\nand covered with a carpet of creeping shore plants in full bloom. On\nthe edge of the wood, to the left, were many flowering shrubs and\npandanus with large scarlet-red flowers. After an hour we crossed the\nriver Longos in a ferry, and soon came to the spur of a crystalline\nchain of mountains, which barred our road and extended itself into\nthe sea as Point Longos. The horses climbed it with difficulty, and\nwe found the stream on the other side already risen so high that we\nrode knee-deep in the water. After sunset we crossed singly, with\ngreat loss of time, in a miserable ferry-boat, over the broad mouth\nof the Pulundaga, where a pleasant road through a forest led us,\nin fifteen minutes, over the mountain-spur, Malanguit, which again\nprojected itself right across our path into the sea, to the mouth\nof the Paracale. The long bridge here was so rotten that we were\nobliged to lead the horses over at wide intervals apart; and on the\nfurther side lies the place called Paracale, from which my companions\ncontinued their journey across Mauban to Manila.",
        "[Red lead.] Paracale and Mambulao are two localities well known to\nall mineralogists, from the red lead ore occurring there. On the\nfollowing morning I returned to Longos; which consists of only a few\nmiserable huts inhabited by gold-washers, who go about almost naked,\nprobably because they are laboring during the greater part of the\nday in the water; but they are also very poor.",
        "[Gold mining.] The soil is composed of rubbish, decomposed fragments of\ncrystalline rock, rich in broken pieces of quartz. The workmen make\nholes in the ground two and one-half feet long, two and one-half\nbroad, and to thirty feet deep. At three feet below the surface\nthe rock is generally found to contain gold, the value increasing\ndown to eighteen feet of depth, and then again diminishing, though\nthese proportions are very uncertain, and there is much fruitless\nsearch. The rock is carried out of the holes in baskets, on ladders\nof bamboo, and the water in small pails; but in the rainy season the\nholes cannot possibly be kept free from water, as they are situated\non the slope of the mountain, and are filled quicker than they can\nbe emptied. The want of apparatus for discharging water also accounts\nfor the fact that the pits are not dug deeper.",
        "[A primitive rock breaker.] The breaking of the auriferous rock is\neffected with two stones; of which one serves as anvil, and the other\nas hammer. The former, which is slightly hollowed in the center, is\nlaid flat upon the ground; and the latter, four by eight by eight\ninches in dimensions, and therefore of about twenty-five pounds\nweight, is made fast with rattan to the top of a slender young tree,\nwhich lies in a sloping position in a fork, and at its opposite end is\nfirmly fixed in the ground. The workman with a jerk forces the stone\nthat serves for hammer down upon the auriferous rock, and allows it\nto be again carried upwards by the elasticity of the young tree.",
        "[An arrastre.] The crushing of the broken rock is effected with\nan apparatus equally crude. A thick stake rises from the center\nof a circular support of rough-hewn stones (which is enclosed in\na circle of exactly similar stones) having an iron pin at its top,\nto which a tree, bent horizontally in the middle, and downwards at\nthe two ends, is fixed. Being set in motion by two carabaos attached\nin front, it drags several heavy stones, which are bound firmly to\nit with rattans, round the circle, and in this manner crushes the\nbroken rock, which has been previously mixed with water, to a fine\nmud. The same apparatus is employed by the Mexican gold-washers,\nunder the name of Rastra. [Gold-washing.] The washing-out of the mud\nis done by women. They kneel before a small wooden gutter filled with\nwater up to the brim, and provided with boards, sloping downwards,\nin front of the space assigned to each woman; the gutter being cut\nout at these places in a corresponding manner, so that a very slender\nstream of water flows evenly across its whole breadth downwards over\nthe board. With her hand the work-woman distributes the auriferous\nmud over the board, which, at the lower edge, is provided with a\ncross-piece; and, when the light sand is washed away, there remains a\nstratum consisting chiefly of iron, flint, and ore, which is taken up\nfrom time to time with a flat piece of board, and laid on one side;\nand at the end of the day’s work, it is washed out in a flat wooden\ndish (batea), and, for the last time, in a coco-shell; when, if they\nare lucky, a fine yellow dust shows itself on the edge. [129] During\nthe last washing the slimy juice of the Gogo is added to the water,\nthe fine heavy sand remaining suspended therein for a longer time\nthan in pure water, and thus being more easily separated from the\ngold-dust. [130]",
        "[The clean-up.] It is further to be mentioned that the refuse from\nthe pits is washed at the upper end of the water-gutter, so that\nthe sand adhering to the stones intended for pounding may deposit\nits gold in the gutter or on the washing-board. In order to melt\nthe gold thus obtained into a lump, in which form it is bought by\nthe dealers, it is poured into a small heart-shell (cardium), and,\nafter being covered with a handful of charcoal, placed  in a potsherd;\nwhen a woman blows through a narrow bamboo-cane on the kindled coals,\nand in one minute the work is completed. [131]",
        "The result of many inquiries shows the profit per head to average\nnot more than one and one-half reals daily. Further to the south-west\nfrom here, on the mountain Malaguit, are seen the ruins of a Spanish\nmining company; a heap of rubbish, a pit fifty feet deep, a large\nhouse fallen to ruin, and a stream-work four feet broad and six feet\nhigh. The mountain consists of gneiss much decomposed, with quartz\nveins in the stream-work, with the exception of the bands of quartz,\nwhich are of almost pure clay earth with sand.",
        "[Edible bird’s nests.] On the sides hung some edible nests of the\nsalangane, but not of the same kind as those found in the caverns\non the south coast of Java. These, which are of much less value than\nthe latter, are only occasionally collected by the Chinese dealers,\nwho reckon them nominally at five cents each. We also found a few of\nthe nest-building birds (Collocalia troglodytes, Gray). [132]",
        "[Abandoned workings.] Around lay so large a number of workings,\nand there were so many little abandoned pits, wholly or half fallen\nto ruin, and more or less grown over, that it was necessary to step\nbetween with great caution. Some of them were still being worked after\nthe mode followed at Lóngos, but with a few slight improvements. The\npits are twice as large as those excavated there, and the rock is\nlifted, up by a pulley to a cylindrical framework of bamboo, which\nis worked by the feet of a lad who sits on a bank higher up.",

        "The highly prized red-lead ores have been found on the top of this same\nhill, N. 30° W. from the village. The quarry was fallen to ruin and\nflooded with rain, so that only a shallow hollow in the ground remained\nvisible; and after a long search amongst the bushes growing there a few\nsmall fragments were found, on which [Chrome-lead ore.] chrome-lead\nore was still clearly to be recognized. Captain Sabino, the former\ngovernor of Paracale, a well-informed Filipino, who, at the suggestion\nof the alcalde, accompanied me, had for some years caused excavations\nto be carried on, in order to find specimens for a speculator who had\nin view the establishment of a new mining company in Spain; but the\nspecimens which were found had not been removed, as speculation in\nmines in the Philippines had, in the interval, fallen into discredit\non the Exchange of Madrid; and as yet only a little box full of sand,\nout of a few small drusy cavities, has been fixed upon and pounded,\nto be sold as variegated writing-sand, after being carefully sifted.",

Its stem is from thirty to forty feet high, cylindrical and\ndark-brown, with white rings a quarter of an inch broad at distances of\nfour inches, and, at similar intervals, crown-shaped bands of thorns\ntwo inches long. Near the crown-leaf the stem passes into the richest\nbrown of burnt sienna.",
        "[Rooming in a powder-magazine.] Notwithstanding a very bad road, a\npleasant ride carried us from Paracale to the sea-shore, and, through\na beautiful wood, to Mambulao, which lies W. by N. I alighted at the\ntribunal, and took up my lodgings in the room where the ammunition was\nkept, as being the only one that could be locked. For greater security,\nthe powder was stored in a corner and covered with carabao-hide;\nbut such were my arrangements that my servant carried about a burning\ntallow light, and his assistant a torch in the hand. When I visited\nthe Filipino priest, I was received in a friendly manner by a young\ngirl who, when I offered my hand, thanked me with a bow, saying,\n\"Tengo las sarnas” (\"I have the itch”). The malady, which is very\ncommon in the Philippines, appears to have its focus in this locality.",
        "[Gneiss and crystalline rock.] A quarter of a league N.N.E. we came\nupon the ruins of another mining undertaking, the Ancla de Oro. Shaft\nand water-cutting had fallen in, and were thickly grown over; and\nonly a few of the considerable buildings were still standing; and\neven those were ready to fall. In a circle some natives were busily\nemployed, in their manner, collecting grains of gold. The rock is\ngneiss, weathered so much that it cannot be recognized; and at a\nthousand paces on the other side is a similar one, clearly crystalline.",

        "[Igorot-mining successful.] What Europeans yet appear unable to\naccomplish, the wild Igorots, who inhabit that trackless range of\nmountains, have carried on successfully for centuries, and to a\nproportionally larger extent; and this is the more remarkable as\nthe metal in that district occurs only in the form of flints, which\neven in Europe can be made profitable only by particular management,\nand not without expense.",
        "[Long-established and considerable.] The copper introduced into\ncommerce by the Igorots from 1840 to 1855, partly in a raw state,\npartly manufactured, is estimated at three hundred piculs yearly.

        "[Copper kettles attributed to Negritos.] In the Ethnographical Museum\nat Berlin is a copper kettle made by those wild tribes. Meyer,\nwho brought it, states that it was made by the Negritos in the\ninterior of the island, and certainly with hammers of porphyry, as\nthey have no iron; and that he further found, in the collection of\nthe Captain General of the Philippines, a large shallow kettle of\nthree and one-half feet in diameter, which had been bought for only\nthree dollars; whence it may be inferred that, in the interior of\nthe island, the copper occurs in large masses, and probably solid;\nfor how could those rude, uncultivated negritos understand the art\nof smelting copper?",
        "[Copper-working a pre-Spanish art.] The locality of these rich\nquarries was still unknown to the Governor, although the copper\nimplements brought thence had, according to an official statement\nof his in 1833, been in use in Manila over two centuries. It is\nnow known that the copper-smiths are not Negritos but Igorots; and\nthere can be no question that they practiced this art, and the still\nmore difficult one of obtaining copper from flint, for a long period\nperhaps previous to the arrival of the Spaniards. They may possibly\nhave learnt them from the Chinese or Japanese. The chief engineer,\nSantos [134], and many others with him, are of opinion that this\nrace is descended from the Chinese or Japanese, from whom he insists\nthat it acquired not only its features (several travellers mention\nthe obliquely placed eyes of the Igorots), its idols, and some of\nits customs, but also the art of working in copper. At all events,\nthe fact that a wild people, living isolated in the mountains,\nshould have made such progress in the science of smelting, is of\nso great interest that a description of their procedure by Santos\n(essentially only a repetition of an earlier account by Hernandez,\nin the Revista Minera, i. 112) will certainly be acceptable.",
        "[The Igorots’ Method.] The present mining district acquired by the\nsociety mentioned, the Sociedad Minero-metalurgica Cantabrofilipina\nde Mancayan, was divided amongst the Igorots into larger or smaller\nparcels strictly according to the number of the population of the\nadjacent villages, whose boundaries were jealously watched; and\nthe possessions of each separate village were again divided between\ncertain families; whence it is that those mountain districts exhibit,\nat the present day, the appearance of a honeycomb. To obtain the ore,\nthey made cavities, in which they lighted fires in suitable spots,\nfor the purpose of breaking the rock into pieces by means of the\nelasticity of the heated water contained in the crevices, with the\nadditional assistance of iron implements. The first breaking-up of\nthe ore was done in the stream-work itself, and the dead heaps lay\npiled up on the ground, so that, in subsequent fires, the flame of\nthe pieces of wood always reached the summit; and by reason of the\nquality of the rock, and the imperfection of the mode of procedure,\nvery considerable down-falls frequently occurred. The ores were divided\ninto rich and quartziferous; the former not being again melted, but\nthe latter being subjected to a powerful and persistent roasting,\nduring which, after a part of the sulphur, antimony, and arsenic\nhad been exhaled, a kind of distillation of sulphate of copper and\nsulphate of iron took place, which appeared as “stone,” or in balls\non the surface of the quartz, and could be easily detached. [135]",
        "[The Smelter.] The furnace or smelting apparatus consisted of a round\nhollow in clayey gound, thirty centimeters in diameter and fifteen\ndeep; with which was connected a conical funnel of fire-proof stone,\ninclined at an angle of 30°, carrying up two bamboo-canes, which were\nfitted into the lower ends of two notched pine-stems; in these two\nslips, covered all over with dry grass or feathers, moved alternately\nup and down, and produced the current required for the smelting.",
        "[Smelting.] When the Igorots obtained black copper or native copper by\nblasting, they prevented loss (by oxidation) by setting up a crucible\nof good fire-proof clay in the form of a still; by which means it was\neasier for them to pour the metal into the forms which it would acquire\nfrom the same clay. The furnace being arranged, they supplied it\nwith from eighteen to twenty kilograms of rich or roasted ore, which,\naccording to the repeated experiments of Hernandez, contained twenty\nper cent of copper; and they proceeded quite scientifically, always\nexposing the ore at the mouth of the funnel, and consequently to the\nair-drafts, and placing the coals at the sides of the furnace, which\nconsisted of loose stones piled one over another to the height of fifty\ncentimeters. The fire having been kindled and the blowing apparatus,\nalready described, in operation, thick clouds of white, yellow, and\norange-yellow smoke were evolved from the partial volatilization of the\nsulphur, arsenic, and antimony, for the space of an hour; but as soon\nas only sulphurous acid was formed, and the heat by this procedure\nhad attained its highest degree, the blowing was discontinued and\nthe product taken out. This consisted of a dross, or, rather, of the\ncollected pieces of ore themselves, which, on account of the flinty\ncontents of the stones composing the funnel, were transformed by the\ndecomposition of the sulphurous metal into a porous mass, and which\ncould not be converted into dross nor form combinations with silicious\nacid, being deficient in the base as well as in the requisite heat;\nand also of a very impure “stone,” of from four to five kilograms\nweight, and containing from fifty to sixty per cent of copper.",
        "[The copper “stone”.] Several of these “stones” were melted down\ntogether for the space of about fifteen hours, in a powerful fire;\nand by this means a great portion of the three volatile substances\nabove named was again evolved; after which they placed them, now heated\nred-hot, in an upright position, but so as to be in contact with the\ndraught; the coals, however, being at the sides of the furnace. After\nblowing for an hour or half-an-hour, they thus obtained, as residuum,\na silicate of iron with antimony and traces of arsenic, a “stone\"\ncontaining from seventy to seventy-five per cent of copper, which they\ntook off in very thin strips, at the same time using refrigerating\nvessels; and at the bottom of the hollow there remained, according\nas the mass was more or less freed from sulphur, a larger or smaller\nquantity (always, however, impure) of black copper.",
        "[Purifying the product.] The purified stones obtained by this second\nprocess were again made red-hot by placing them between rows of wood,\nin order that they might not melt into one another before the fire\nhad freed them from impurities.",
        "The black copper obtained from the second operation, and the stones\nwhich were re-melted at the same time, were then subjected to a\nthird process in the same furnace (narrowed by quarry stones and\nprovided with a crucible); which produced a residuum of silicious\niron and black copper, which was poured out into clay moulds, and\nin this shape came into commerce. This black copper contained from\nninety-two to ninety-four per cent of copper, and was tinged by a\ncarbonaceous compound of the same metal known by its yellow color,\nand the oxide on the surface arising from the slow cooling, which will\noccur notwithstanding every precaution; and the surface so exposed\nto oxidation they beat with green twigs. When the copper, which had\nbeen thus extracted with so much skill and patience by the Igorots,\nwas to be employed in the manufacture of kettles, pipes, and other\ndomestic articles, or for ornament, it was submitted to another\nprocess of purification, which differed from the preceding only in\none particular, that the quantity of coals was diminished and the\nair-draught increased according as the process of smelting drew near\nto its termination, which involved the removal of the carbonaceous\ncompound by oxidation. Santos found, by repeated experiment, that even\nfrom ores of the mean standard of twenty per cent, only from eight to\nten per cent of black copper was extracted by the third operation; so\nthat between eight to twelve per cent still remained in the residuum\nor porous quartz of the operation.",
        "[Tagalog women traders.] It was difficult to procure the necessary\nmeans of transport for my baggage on the return journey to Paracale,\nthe roads being so soaked by the continuous rains that no one would\nventure his cattle for the purpose. In Mambulao the influence of\nthe province on its western border is very perceptible, and Tagalog\nis understood almost better than Bicol; the Tagalog element being\nintroduced amongst the population by women, who with their families\ncome here, from Lucban and Mauban, in the pursuit of trade. They buy up\ngold, and import stuffs and other wares in exchange. The gold acquired\nis commonly from fifteen to sixteen carats, and a mark determines\nits quality.

They therefore, of necessity,\ncollapsed so soon as the speculators ceased from their operations.",
        "[Small output.] North Camarines yields no metal with the exception\nof the little gold obtained by the natives in so unprofitable a\nmanner. The king of Spain at first received a fifth, and then a\ntenth, of the produce; but the tax subsequently ceased. In Morga’s\ntime the tenth amounted on an average to $10,000 (\"which was kept\nquite secret”); the profit, consequently, to above $100,000. Gemelli\nCarreri was informed by the governor of Manila that gold to the value\nof $200,000 was collected annually without the help of either fire or\nquicksilver, and that Paracale, in particular, was rich in gold. No\ndata exist from which I could estimate the actual rate of produce; and\nthe answers to several inquiries deserve no mention.

        "[Indang.] I returned down the stream in a boat to Indang, a\ncomparatively flourishing place, of smaller population but more\nconsiderable trade than Daet; the export consisting principally of\nabacá, and the import of rice.",
        "[Storms.] An old mariner, who had navigated this coast for many\nyears, informed me that the same winds prevail from Daet as far as\nCape Engaño, the north-east point of Luzon. From October to March\nthe north-east wind prevails, the monsoon here beginning with north\nwinds, which are of short duration and soon pass into the north-east;\nand in January and February the east winds begin and terminate\nthe monsoon. The heaviest rains fall from October to January, and\nin October typhoons sometimes occur. Beginning from the north or\nnorth-east, they pass to the north-west, where they are most violent;\nand then to the north and east, sometimes as far as to the south-east,\nand even to the south. In March and April, and sometimes in the\nbeginning of May, shifting winds blow, which bring in the south-west\nmonsoon; but the dry season, of which April and May are the driest\nmonths, is uninterrupted by rain. Thunder storms occur from June to\nNovember; most frequently in August. During the south-west monsoon\nthe sea is very calm; but in the middle of the north-east monsoon all\nnavigation ceases on the east coast. In the outskirts of Baler rice\nis sown in October, and reaped in March and April. Mountain rice is\nnot cultivated.",
        "[On foot to San Miguel bay.] Sending my baggage from Daet to Cabusao\nin a schooner, I proceeded on foot, by the road to that place, to\nthe coast on the west side of the Bay of San Miguel. We crossed the\nmouth of the river in a boat, which the horses swam after; but they\nwere soon abandoned from unfitness. At the mouth of the next river,\nSacavin, the water was so high that the bearers stripped themselves\nnaked and carried the baggage over on their heads. In simple jacket\nand cotton hose, I found this precaution needless; indeed, according\nto my experience, it is both refreshing and salutary to wear wet\nclothes, during an uniformly high temperature; besides which, one\nis thereby spared many a spring over ditches, and many a roundabout\ncourse to avoid puddles, which, being already wet through, we no longer\nfear. After having waded over eight other little rivers we were obliged\nto leave the shore and pursue the road to Colasi along steep, slippery,\nforest paths, the place lying right in the middle of the west side of\nthe bay. The sea-shore was very beautiful. Instead of a continuous and,\nat the ebb, ill-smelling border of mangroves, which is never wanting in\nthose places where the land extends into the sea, the waves here reach\nthe foot of the old trees of the forest, many of which were washed\nunderneath. Amongst the most remarkable was a fringe of stately old\nBarringtoni, covered with orchids and other epiphytes–gorgeous trees\nwhen in flower; the red stamens, five inches long, with golden yellow\nanthers like tassels, depending from the boughs; and their fruit, of\nthe size of the fist, is doubly useful to the fisherman, who employs\nthem, on account of their specific gravity, in floating his nets, and\nbeats them to pieces to stupefy the fish. The foremost trees stood bent\ntowards the sea, and have been so deflected probably for a long time,\nlike many others whose remains still projected out of the water. The\ndestruction of this coast appears to be very considerable. Amongst\nthe climbing palms one peculiar kind was very abundant, the stem of\nwhich, as thick as the arm, either dragged itself, leafless, along\nthe ground, or hung in arches above the branches, carrying a crown\nof leaves only at its extremity; while another, from its habitat the\ncommon calamus, had caryota leaves. Wild boars are very plentiful here;\na hunter offered us two at one real each.",
        "[Colasi.] The direction of the flat coast which extends N.N.W. to\nS.S.E. from the point of Daet is here interrupted by the little peak\nof Colasi, which projects to the east, and has grown so rapidly\nthat all old people remember it to have been lower. In the Visita\nColasi, on the northern slope of the mountain, the sea is so rough\nthat no boat can live in it. The inhabitants carry on fishing; their\nfishing-grounds lie, however, on the southern slope of the mountain,\nin the sheltered bay of Lalauigan, which we reached after thee hours’\njourney over the ridge.",
        "[By sea to Cabusao.] A four-oared baroto, hired at this place,\nas the weather was favorable, was to have conveyed us in two hours\nto Cabusao, the port of Naga; but the wind swung round, and a storm\nensued. Thoroughly wet and not without loss, we ran to Barceloneta,\na visita situated at a third of the distance. The intelligent Teniente\nof Colasi, whom we met here, also confirmed the fact of the rapid\ngrowth of the little peak.",
        "[Unreliable excuses.] In opposition to my wish to ascend the mountain,\ngreat obstacles were said to exist when every one would be occupied\nin preparations for the Easter festival, which would hardly occur\nduring the succeeding weeks. As these objections did not convince me,\na more substantial reason was discovered the next morning. Inland\nshoes are excellent for the mud, and particularly for horseback;\nbut for climbing mountains, or rough ground, they would not last a\nday; and the one remaining pair of strong European shoes, which I\nreserved for particular purposes, had been given away by my servant,\nwho did not like climbing mountains, on the pretext they were very\nmuch too heavy for me.",
        "[A shipwrecked family.] The shore from Barceloneta to Cabusao is of\nthe same character as the Daet-Colasi but running north and south;\nthe ground, sandy clay, is covered with a thick stratum of broken\nbivalves. The road was very difficult, as the high tide forced us to\nclimb between the trees and thick underwood. On the way we met an\nenterprising family who had left Daet with a cargo of coconuts for\nNaga, and had been wrecked here; saving only one out of five tinajas\nof oil, but recovering all the nuts. [137] They were living in a\nsmall hastily-run-up hut, upon coconuts, rice, fish, and mussels,\nin expectation of a favorable wind to return. There were several\nvarieties of shore-birds; but my gun would not go off, although\nmy servant, in expectation of a hunt, had cleaned it with especial\ncare. As he had lost the ramrod whilst cleaning it, the charge was\nnot withdrawn before we reached Cabusao, when it was discovered that\nboth barrels were full of sand to above the touchhole.",
        "[Making palm-sugar.] The coast was still more beautiful than on the\npreceding day, particularly in one place where the surge beat against a\nwood of fan-palms (Corypha sp.). On the side facing the sea, in groups\nor rows stood the trees, bereft of their crowns, or lying overthrown\nlike columns amid the vast ruins of temples (one of them was three feet\nin diameter); and the sight immediately reminded me of Pompeii. I could\nnot account for the bareness of the trunks, until I discovered a hut in\nthe midst of the palms, in which two men were endeavoring to anticipate\nthe waves in their work of destruction by the preparation of sugar\n(tunguleh). For this purpose, after stripping off the leaves (this\npalm flowering at the top), the upper end of the stem is cut across,\nthe surface of the incision being inclined about five degrees towards\nthe horizon, and, near its lower edge, hollowed out to a very shallow\ngutter. The juice exudes over the whole surface of the cut, with the\nexception of the intersected exterior petioles, and, being collected\nin the shallow channel, is conducted by a piece of banana-leaf,\ntwo inches broad, and four inches long, into a bamboo-cane attached\nto the trunk. In order to avert the rain from the saccharine issue,\nwhich has a faint, pleasantly aromatic flavor as of barley-sugar,\nall the trees which have been tapped are provided with caps formed of\nbent and folded palm-leaves. The average daily produce of each tree is\nfour bamboos, the interior of which is about three inches and a half\nin diameter. When removed, they are full to about eighteen inches;\nwhich gives somewhat more than ten quarts daily.",
        "[The money side.] The produce of each tree of course is very\nunequal. Always intermittent, it ceases completely after two months–at\nthe utmost, three months; but, the proportion of those newly cut to\nthose cut at an earlier date being the same, the yield of the incisions\nis about equal. The juice of thirty-three palms, after evaporation in\nan iron pan immediately upon each collection, produces one ganta, or\n(there being four such collections) four gantas, daily; the weekly\nresult being twenty gantas, or two tinajas of sugar, each worth two\ndollars and a half on the spot. This statement, derived from the people\nthemselves, probably shows the proportion somewhat more unfavorable\nthan it really is; still, according to the opinion of an experienced\nmestizo, the difference cannot be very considerable. Assuming the above\nfigures as correct, however, one of these magnificent trees would give\nabout one dollar and two-thirds, or, after deducting the laborers’\nwages one real per diem, about a thaler and two-thirds; not a large\nsum truly; but it is some consolation to know that, even if man did\nnot interfere, these trees would in process of time fall victims to\nthe breakers, and that, even if protected against external ravages,\nthey are doomed to natural extinction after once producing fruit.",
        "[Neglected roads.] Cabusao lies in the southern angle of San Miguel\nBay which is, almost on every side, surrounded by high mountains, and\naffords good anchorage for ships. From here I repaired across Naga to\nthe south coast. Four leagues from Naga, in the heart of Ragay, on the\nsouthern border of Luzon, is the small but deep harbor of Pasacao; and\ntwo hours by water conducted us to the intermediate Visita Pamplona,\nwhence the route is pursued by land. The still-existing remnant of the\nold road was in a miserable condition, and even at that dry season\nof the year scarcely passable; the bridges over the numerous little\nditches were broken down, and in many places, right across the road,\nlay large stones and branches of trees which had been brought there\nyears before to repair the bridges, and, having been unused, have\never since continued to obstruct the road.",
        "[A French planter.] In Quitang, between Pamplona and Pasacao, where two\nbrooks unite themselves into one little river debouching at the latter\nplace, a young Frenchman had established a hacienda. He was contented\nand hopeful, and loudly praised the industry and friendliness of his\npeople. Probably because they make fewer exactions, foreigners, as a\nrule, seem to agree better with the natives than Spaniards. Of these\nexactions, the bitterest complaints are rife of the injustice of the\ndemands made upon the lower classes in the settlement of their wages;\nwhich, if they do not immediately find the necessary hands for every\nemployment, do not correspond with the enhanced value of the products;\nand, according to them, the natives must even be driven from public\nemployments, to labor in their service. [138]",
        "[The Filipino as a laborer.] The Filipino certainly is more independent\nthan the European laborer, because he has fewer wants and, as a native\nlandowner, is not compelled to earn his bread as the daily laborer of\nanother; yet, with reference to wages, it may be questioned whether\nany colony whatever offers more favorable conditions to the planter\nthan the Philippines. In Dutch India, where the prevalence of monopoly\nalmost excludes private industry, free laborers obtain one-third of a\nguilder–somewhat more than one real, the usual wages in the wealthy\nprovinces of the Philippines (in the poorer it amounts to only the\nhalf); and the Javanese are not the equals of the Filipinos, either\nin strength, or intelligence, or skill; and the rate of wages in all\nthe older Slave States is well known. For the cultivation of sugar and\ncoffee, Mauritius and Ceylon are obliged to import foreign laborers\nat great expense, and to pay them highly; and yet they are successful.",
        "[Pasacao.] From Quitang to Pasacao the road was far worse than\nit had heretofore been; and this is the most important road in\nthe province! Before reaching Pasacao, evident signs are visible,\non the denuded sides of the limestone, of its having been formerly\nwashed by the sea. Pasacao is picturesquely situated at the end of the\nvalley which is intersected by the Itulan, and extends from Pamplona,\nbetween wooded mountains of limestone, as far as the sea. The ebb tides\nhere are extremely irregular. From noon to evening no difference was\nobservable, and, when the decrease just became visible, the tide rose\nagain. Immediately to the south, and facing the district, the side of a\nmountain, two thousand feet high and above one thousand feet broad, had\ntwo years ago given way to the subterranean action of the waves. The\nrock consists of a tough calcareous breccia, full of fragments of\nmussels and corals; but, being shoeless, I could not remain on the\nsharp rock sufficiently long to make a closer examination.",
        "[A beautiful coast.] For the same reason, I was obliged to leave\nthe ascent of the Yamtik, which I had before vainly attempted from\nLibmanan, unaccomplished from this point, although I had the advantage\nof the company of an obliging French planter in a boat excursion in a\nnorth-westerly direction along the coast. Here our boat floated along\nover gardens of coral, swarming with magnificently colored fishes;\nand after two hours we reached a cavern in the limestone, Suminabang,\nso low that one could stir in it only by creeping; which contained a\nfew swallows and bats. On the Calebayan river, on the further side of\nPoint Tanaun, we came upon a solitary shed, our night-quarters. Here\nthe limestone range is interrupted by an isolated cliff on the left\nbank of the little river, consisting of a crystalline rock chiefly\ncomposed of hornblende; which moreover, on the side exposed to the\nwater, is surrounded completely by limestone.",
        "[Cattle.] The surrounding mountains must swarm with wild boars. Under\nthe thatched roof of our hut, which serves as a shelter to occasional\nhunters, more than a hundred and fifty lower jaw-bones were set\nup as hunting trophies. The place appeared as if created for the\nbreeding of cattle. Soft with fodder grass, and covered with a few\ngroups of trees, with slopes intersected by rustling brooks, it rose\nup out of the sea, and was encompassed by a steep wall of rock in\nthe form of a semicircle; and here cattle would find grass, water,\nshade, and the protection of an enclosing rampart. While travelling\nalong the coast, we had remarked a succession of similar localities,\nwhich however, from lack of enterprise and from the dread of pirates,\nwere not utilized. As soon as our supper was prepared, we carefully\nextinguished our fire, that it might not serve as a signal to the\nvagabonds of the sea, and kept night watches.",
        "[A delusive cave.] On the following morning we intended to visit\na cave never before entered; but, to our astonishment, we found\nno proper cavern, but only an entrance to a cavern a few feet in\ndepth. Visible from a distance, it must often have been passed by\nthe hunters, although, as we were assured by our companions–who\nwere astonished at the delusion–-no one had ventured to enter it\nfrom stress of superstitious terror.",
        "[Isolation of fertile regions.] The north coast of Camarines,\nas I have frequently mentioned, is, during the north-east monsoon,\nalmost unapproachable; while the south coast, screened by the outlying\nislands, remains always accessible. The most fertile districts of the\neastern provinces, which during summer export their produce by the\nnorthern ports, in the winter often remain for months cut off from\nall communication with the chief town, because there is no road over\nthe small strip of land to the south coast. How much has been done by\nNature, and how little by man, to facilitate this intercourse, is very\nevident when we reflect upon the condition of the road to Pasacao,\nlately described, in connection with the condition of matters in the\neast, as shown by the map.",
        "[River highways.] Two rivers, one coming from the north-west,\nand the other from the south-east, and both navigable before they\nreach the borders of the province, flow through the middle of it in\na line parallel with the coast (taking no account of its windings),\nand, after their junction, send their waters together through the\nestuary of Cabusao into the Bay of San Miguel. The whole province,\ntherefore, is traversed through its center by two navigable rivers,\nwhich, as regards commerce, form only one.",
        "[Cabusao and Pasacao harbors.] But the harbor of Cabusao, at the bottom\nof the Bay of San Miguel, is not accessible during the north-east\nmonsoon, and has this further disadvantage, that the intercourse of\nthe whole of the eastern part of Luzon with Manila can be carried\non only by a very circuitous route. On the south coast, on the other\nhand, is the harbor of Pasacao, into which a navigable little river,\nabove a mile in width, discharges itself; so that the distance between\nthis river highway and the nearest point of the Bicol River amounts to\na little more than a mile. The road connecting the two seas, laid out\nby an active alcalde in 1847, and maintained up to 1852, was however,\nat the date of my inquiry, in so bad a condition that a picul of abacá\npaid two reals freight for this short distance, in the dry season; and\nin the wet season it could not be forwarded for double the price. [139]",
        "[Bad roads raise freights.] Many similar instances may be brought\nforward. In 1861 the English vice-consul reported that in Iloilo a\npicul of sugar had risen more than 2 r. in price (as much as the cost\nof freight from Iloilo to Manila), in consequence of the bad state\nof the road between the two places, which are only one league asunder.",
        "[Social and political reasons for bad roads.] If, without reference to\ntransport by sea, the islands were not favored in so extraordinary a\nmanner by innumerable rivers with navigable mouths, a still greater\nproportion of their produce would not have been convertible into\nmoney. The people, as well as the local authorities, have no desire\nfor roads, which they themselves construct by forced labor, and,\nwhen completed, must maintain by the same method; for, when no roads\nare made, the laborers are so much more easily employed in private\noperations. Even the parish priests, generally, are as little favorable\nto the planning of commercial intercourse, by means of which trade,\nprosperity, and enlightenment would be introduced into the country,\nand their authority undermined. Indeed the Government itself, up\nto within a short time since, favored such a state of affairs; for\nbad roads belong to the essence of the old Spanish colonial policy,\nwhich was always directed to effect the isolation of the separate\nprovinces of their great transmarine possessions, and to prevent the\ngrowth of a sense of national interest, in order to facilitate their\ngovernment by the distant mother country.",
        "[Spanish economic backwardness.] Besides, in Spain itself matters\nare no better. The means of communication there are so very deficient\nthat, as an instance, merchandise is sent from Santander to Barcelona,\nround the whole Iberian peninsula, in preference to the direct route,\nwhich is partly accomplished by railway. [140] In Estremadura the hogs\nwere fed with wheat (live animals can be transported without roads),\nwhile at the same time the seaports were importing foreign grain. [141]\nThe cause of this condition of affairs in that country is to be sought\nless in a disordered state of finance, than in the enforcement of\nthe Government maxim which enjoins the isolation of separate provinces.",
        "[Mt. Isaróg.] The Isaróg (pronounced Issaró) rises up in the middle\nof Camarines, between San Miguel and Lagonoy bays. While its eastern\nslope almost reaches the sea, it is separated on its western side by\na broad strip of inundated land from San Miguel Bay. In circumference\nit is at least twelve leagues; and its height 1,966 meters. [142]\nVery flat at its base, it swells gradually to 16°, and higher up\nto 21° of inclination, and extends itself, in its western aspect,\ninto a flat dome-shaped summit. But, if viewed from the eastern side,\nit has the appearance of a circular chain of mountains rent asunder\nby a great ravine. On Coello’s map this ravine is erroneously laid\ndown as extending from south to north; its bearing really is west to\neast. Right in front of its opening, and half a league south from Goa,\nlies the pretty little village of Rungus, by which it is known. The\nexterior sides of the mountain and the fragments of its large crater\nare covered with impenetrable wood. Respecting its volcanic eruptions\ntradition says nothing.",
        "[Primitive mountaineers.] The higher slopes form the dwelling-place\nof a small race of people, whose independence and the customs\nof a primitive age have almost entirely separated them from the\ninhabitants of the plain. One or two Cimarrons might occasionally\nhave been attracted hither, but no such instance is remembered. The\ninhabitants of the Isaróg are commonly, though mistakenly, called\nIgorots; and I retain the name, since their tribal relationship has not\nyet been accurately determined; they themselves maintaining that their\nancestors always dwelt in that locality. There are some who, in the\nopinion of the parish priest of Camarines, speak the Bicol language\nin the purest manner. Their manners and customs are very similar,\nin many respects, to what they were on the arrival of the Spaniards;\nand sometimes they also remind one of those prevailing among the Dyaks\nof Borneo at the present day. [143] These circumstances give rise to\nthe conjecture that they may be the last of a race which maintained\nits independence against the Spanish rule, and probably also against\nthe little tyrants who ruled over the plain before the arrival of the\nEuropeans. When Juan de Salcedo undertook his triumphal march round\nNorth Luzon he found everywhere, at the mouths of the rivers, seafaring\ntribes living under many chieftains who, after a short struggle, were\nslain by the superior discipline and better arms of the Spaniards,\nor submitted voluntarily to the superior race; but he did not succeed\nin subduing the independent tribes in the interior; and these are\nstill to be found in all the larger islands of the Philippine group.",
        "[Similarity to Indian Archipelago conditions.] Similar conditions are\nfound in many places in the Indian Archipelago. The Malays, carrying\non trade and piracy, possess the shore, and their language prevails\nthere; the natives being either subdued by them, or driven into the\nforests, the inaccessibility of which ensures to them a miserable\nbut independent existence. [144]",
        "[Policy of non-intercourse with heathens.] In order to break down\nthe opposition of the wild races, the Spanish Government forbade\nits subjects, under the penalty of one hundred blows and two years\nof forced labor, “to trade or to have any intercourse with the\nheathens in the mountains who pay no tribute to his Catholic Majesty,\nfor although they would exchange their gold, wax, etc., for other\nnecessaries, they will never change for the better.” Probably this\nlaw has for centuries directly contributed to save the barbarians,\nnotwithstanding their small numbers, from complete extermination;\nfor free intercourse between a people existing by agriculture,\nand another living principally by the chase, speedily leads to the\ndestruction of the latter.",
        "[Christian Mountaineers’ villages.] The number of the Igorots of the\nIsaróg however, been much diminished by deadly battles between the\ndifferent ranchos, and by the marauding expeditions which, until\na short time since, were annually undertaken by the commissioners\nof taxes, in the interest of the Government monopoly, against\nthe tobacco fields of the Igorots. Some few have been “pacified\"\n(converted to Christianity and tribute); in which case they are obliged\nto establish themselves in little villages of scattered huts, where\nthey can be occasionally visited by the priest of the nearest place;\nand, in order to render the change easier to them, a smaller tax than\nusual is temporarily imposed upon such newly-obtained subjects.",
        "[Tobacco monopoly wars.] I had deferred the ascent of the mountain\nuntil the beginning of the dry season of the year; but I learned in\nNaga that my wish was hardly practicable, because the expeditions\nagainst the ranchos of the mountain, which I have already mentioned,\nusually occurred about this time. As the wild people could not\nunderstand why they should not cultivate on their own fields a plant\nwhich had become a necessity to them, they saw in the Cuadrilleros,\nnot functionaries of a civilized State, but robbers, against whom\nthey were obliged to defend themselves by force; and appearances\ncontributed no less to confirm them in their error; for these did\nnot content themselves with destroying the plantations of tobacco,\nbut the huts were burnt to the ground, the fruit-trees hewn down, and\nthe fields laid waste. Such forays never occurred without bloodshed,\nand often developed into a little war which was carried on by the\nmountaineers for a long time afterwards, even against people who were\nentirely uninterested in it–Filipinos and Europeans. The expedition\nthis year was to take place in the beginning of April; the Igorots\nconsequently were in a state of great agitation, and had, a few\ndays previously, murdered a young unarmed Spaniard in the vicinity\nof Mabotoboto, at the foot of the mountain, by bringing him to the\nground with a poisoned arrow, and afterwards inflicting twenty-one\nwounds with the wood-knife (bolo).",
        "[A policy of peace.] Fortunately there arrived soon after a countermand\nfrom Manila, where the authorities seemed to have been gradually\nconvinced of the harmful tendency of such violent measures. It could\nnot be doubted that this intelligence would quickly spread amongst the\nranchos; and, acting upon the advice of the commandant (upon whom,\nvery much against his inclination, the conduct of the expedition\nhad devolved), I lost no time in availing myself of the anticipated\nseason of quiet. The Government have since adopted the prudent method\nof purchasing the tobacco, which is voluntarily cultivated by the\nIgorots, at the ordinary rate, and, where practicable, encouraging\nthem to lay out new fields, instead of destroying those in existence.",
        "[A populous fertile district.] The next day at noon I left Naga on\nhorseback. The pueblos of Mogarao, Canaman, Quipayo, and Calabanga, in\nthis fertile district follow so thickly upon one another that they form\nan almost uninterrupted succession of houses and gardens. Calabanga\nlies half a league from the sea, between the mouths of two rivers,\nthe more southerly of which is sixty feet broad and sufficiently deep\nfor large trading vessels. [145]",
        "[A bare plain and wretched village.] The road winds round the foot\nof the Isaróg first to the north-east and then to the east. Soon the\nblooming hedges cease, and are succeeded by a great bare plain, out of\nwhich numerous flat hillocks raise themselves. Both hills and plain,\nwhen we passed, served for pasturage; but from August to January they\nare sown with rice; and fields of batata are occasionally seen. After\nfour hours we arrived at the little village of Maguiring (Manguirin),\nthe church of which, a tumble-down shed, stood on an equally naked\nhillock; and from its neglected condition one might have guessed that\nthe priest was a native.",
        "[Many mountain water courses.] This hillock, as well as the others\nwhich I examined, consisted of the débris of the Isaróg, the more\nor less decomposed trachytic fragments of hornblende rock, the\nspaces between which were filled up with red sand. The number of\nstreams sent down by the Isaróg, into San Miguel and Lagonoy bays,\nis extraordinarily large. On the tract behind Maguiring I counted, in\nthree-quarters of an hour, five considerable estuaries, that is to say,\nabove twenty feet broad; and then, as far as Goa, twenty-six more;\naltogether, thirty-one: but there are more, as I did not include\nthe smallest; and yet the distance between Maguiring and Goa, in\na straight line, does not exceed three miles. This accounts for\nthe enormous quantity of steam with which this mighty condenser is\nfed. I have not met with this phenomenon on any other mountain in so\nstriking a manner. One very remarkable circumstance is the rapidity\nwith which the brimming rivulets pass in the estuaries, enabling them\nto carry the trading vessels, sometimes even ships, into a main stream\n(if the expression may be allowed), while the scanty contributions\nof their kindred streams on the northern side have scarcely acquired\nthe importance of a mill-brook. These waters, from their breadth, look\nlike little rivers, although in reality they consist of only a brook,\nup to the foot of the mountain, and of a river’s mouth in the plain;\nthe intermediate part being absent.",
        "[Comparison with Javan Mountain district.] The country here is\nstrikingly similar to the remarkable mountain district of the\nGelungúng, described by Junghuhn; [146] yet the origin of these\nrising grounds differs in some degree from that of those in Java. The\nlatter were due to the eruption of 1822, and the great fissure in the\nwall of the crater of the Gelungúng, which is turned towards them,\nshows unmistakably whence the materials for their formation were\nderived; but the great chasm of the Isaróg opens towards the east,\nand therefore has no relation to the numberless hillocks on the\nnorth-west of the mountain. Behind Maguiring they run more closely\ntogether, their summits are flatter, and their sides steeper; and they\npass gradually into a gently inclined slope, rent into innumerable\nclefts, in the hollows of which as many brooks are actively employed\nin converting the angular outlines of the little islands into these\nrounded hillocks. The third river behind Maguiring is larger than\nthose preceding it; on the sixth lies the large Visita of Borobod;\nand on the tenth, that of Ragay. The rice fields cease with the hill\ncountry, and on the slope, which is well drained by deep channels,\nonly wild cane and a few groups of trees grow. Passing by many\nvillages, whose huts were so isolated and concealed that they might\nremain unobserved, we arrived at five o’clock at Tagunton; from which\na road, practicable for carabao carts, and used for the transport of\nthe abacá grown in the district, leads to Goa; and here, detained by\nsickness, I hired a little house, in which I lay for nearly four weeks,\nno other remedies offering themselves to me but hunger and repose.",
        "[Useful friends.] During this time I made the acquaintance of some\nnewly-converted Igorots, and won their confidence. Without them I would\nhave had great difficulty in ascending the mountains as well as to\nvisit their tribe in its farms without any danger. [147] When, at last,\nI was able to quit Goa, my friends conducted me, as the first step,\nto their settlement; where, having been previously recommended and\nexpected, I easily obtained the requisite number of attendants to take\ninto their charge the animals and plants which were collected for me.",
        "[A heathen Mountaineers’ settlement.] On the following morning the\nascent was commenced. Even before we arrived at the first rancho,\nI was convinced of the good report that had preceded me. The master\nof the house came towards us and conducted us by a narrow path to his\nhut, after having removed the foot-lances, which projected obliquely\nout of the ground, but were dexterously concealed by brushwood and\nleaves. [148] A woman employed in weaving, at my desire, continued\nher occupation. The loom was of the simplest kind. The upper end,\nthe chain-beam, which consists of a piece of bamboo, is fixed to\ntwo bars or posts; and the weaver sits on the ground, and to the two\nnotched ends of a small lath, which supplies the place of the weaving\nbeam, hooks on a wooden bow, in the arch of which the back of the\nlath is fitted. Placing her feet against two pegs in the ground and\nbending her back, she, by means of the bow, stretches the material\nout straight. A netting-needle, longer than the breadth of the web,\nserves instead of the weaver’s shuttle, but it can be pushed through\nonly by considerable friction, and not always without breaking the\nchains of threads. A lath of hard wood (caryota), sharpened like a\nknife, represents the trestle, and after every stroke it is placed\nupon the edge; after which the comb is pushed forward, a thread put\nthrough, and struck fast, and so forth. The web consisted of threads\nof the abacá, which were not spun, but tied one to another.",
        "[A giant fern hedge.] The huts I visited deserve no special\ndescription. Composed of bamboos and palm-leaves, they are not\nessentially different from the dwellings of poor Filipinos; and in\ntheir neighborhood were small fields planted with batata, maize,\ncaladium and sugar-cane, and enclosed by magnificent polypody\nferns. One of the highest of these, which I caused to be felled for\nthe purpose, measured in the stem nine meters, thirty centimeters;\nin the crown, two meters, twelve centimeters; and its total length\nwas eleven meters, forty-two centimeters or over thirty-six feet.",
        "[Simple stringed instruments.] A young lad produced music on a kind of\nlute, called baringbau; consisting of the dry shaft of the scitamina\nstretched in the form of a bow by means of a thin tendril instead of\ngut. Half a coco shell is fixed in the middle of the bow, which, when\nplaying, is placed against the abdomen, and serves as a sounding board;\nand the string when struck with a short wand, gave out a pleasing\nhumming sound, realizing the idea of the harp and plectrum in their\nsimplest forms. Others accompanied the musician on Jews’ harps of\nbamboos, as accurate as those of the Mintras on the Malay Peninsula;\nand there was one who played on a guitar, which he had himself made,\nbut after a European pattern. The hut contained no utensils besides\nbows, arrows, and a cooking pot. The possessor of clothes bore them\non his person. I found the women as decently clad as the Filipino\nChristian women, and carrying, besides, a forest knife, or bolo. As\na mark of entire confidence, I was taken into the tobacco fields,\nwhich were well concealed and protected by foot-lances; and they\nappeared to be carefully looked after.",
        "[The people and their crops.] The result of my familiarity with\nthis people, both before and after this opportunity, may be briefly\nsummed up: They live on the higher slopes of the mountain, never,\nindeed, below 1,500 feet; each family by itself. It is difficult to\nascertain how many of them there may now be, as but little intercourse\ntakes place amongst them. In the part of the mountain belonging to\nthe district of Goa, their number is estimated at about fifty men\nand twenty women, including the children: but twenty years before\nthe population was more numerous. Their food consists principally\nof batata, besides some gabi (caladium). A little maize is likewise\ncultivated, as well as some ubi (dioscorea), and a small quantity of\nsugar-cane for chewing.",
        "[Batatas.] In laying out a batata field, a wood is partially cleared,\nthe earth loosened with the blunt forest knife (bolo), and the bulbs\nor layers then planted; and within four months the harvest begins,\nand continues uninterruptedly from the time the creeping plant strikes\nroot and forms tubers. [Rotation of crops.] After two years, however,\nthe produce is so much diminished that the old plants are pulled up,\nin order to make room for new ones obtained from the runners. The\nfield is then changed, or other fruits cultivated thereon, but with\nthe addition of manure. A piece of land, fifty brazas long, and thirty\nwide, is sufficient for the support of a family. Only occasionally in\nthe wet season does this resource fail, and then they resort to gabi,\nwhich appears to be as easily cultivated on wet as on dry ground,\nbut is not so profitable as batata. The young shoots of the gabi are\nplanted at distances of a vara, and if consumed in a proper manner,\nought not to be cropped till after a year. Each family kills weekly\none or two wild hogs. Stags are rare, although I obtained a fine\npair of horns; and they do not use the skin. Bows and arrows are\nused in hunting; some poisoned, and some not. Every rancho keeps\ndogs, which live principally on batata, and also cats to protect the\nfields against rats; and they also have poultry, [Game cocks a Spanish\ninnovation.] but no game cocks; which, having been first introduced\ninto the Philippines by the Spaniards are seldom if ever, wanting in\nthe huts of the Filipinos; but the inhabitants of the Isaróg are as\nyet free from this passion.",
        "[Trade.] The few products of a more advanced civilization which they\nrequire, they obtain by the sale of the spontaneous productions of\ntheir forests, chiefly wax and resin (pili), [149] apnik, dagiangan\n(a kind of copal), and some abacá. Wax, which is much in request\nfor church solemnities, fetches half a dollar per catty; and resin\naverages half a real per chinanta. Business is transacted very\nsimply. Filipinos, having intercourse with the Igorots, make a\ncontract with them; and they collect the products and bring them\nto a place previously agreed on, where the Filipinos receive them,\nafter paying down the stipulated price.",
        "[Religion.] Physicians and magicians, or persons supposed to be\npossessed of secret powers, are unknown; every one helps himself. In\norder to arrive at a clear understanding of their religious views,\na longer intercourse would be necessary. But they certainly believe\nin one God, or, at least, say so, when they are closely questioned\nby Christians; and have also loosely acquired several of the external\npractices of Catholicism, which they employ as spells.",
        "[Respect for women and aged.] Hunting and hard labor constitute the\nemployment of man in general, as well as in the Philippines. The\npractice of employing women as beasts of burden–which, although\nit exists among many of the peoples of Europe, for example, the\nBasques, Wallachians, and Portuguese, is almost peculiar to barbarous\nnations,–seems to have been lost in the Philippines as far back\nas the time of its discovery by the Spaniards; and even among the\nwild people of the Isaróg, the women engage only in light labor,\nand are well treated. Every family supports its aged and those unfit\nfor labor. [Medicine.] Headaches and fevers were stated to me as the\nprevalent maladies; for which burnt rice, pounded and mixed to a pap\nwith water, is taken as a remedy; and in case of severe headache they\nmake an incision in the forehead of the sufferer. Their prevalence is\nexplained by the habit of neutralizing the ill effects of drinking\nwater in excess, when they are heated, by the consumption of warm\nwater in large doses; and the rule holds with regard to coco-water;\nthe remedy for immoderate use of which is warm coco-water. Their\nmuscular power is small, and they are not able to carry more than\nfifty pounds weight to any considerable distance.",
        "[Manufactures.] Besides the chase and agriculture, their occupations\nare restricted to the manufacture of extremely rude weapons, for which\nthey purchase the iron, when required, from the Filipinos, and of\nthe coarse webs made by the women, and of wicker work. Every father\nof a family is master in his own house, and acknowledges no power\nhigher than himself. In the event of war with neighboring tribes,\nthe bravest places himself at the head, and the rest follow him as\nlong as they are able; there is no deliberate choosing of a leader.",
        "[Death customs.] On the whole, they are peaceful and honorable towards\neach other, although the idle occasionally steal the fruits of the\nfields; and, should the thief be caught, the person robbed punishes\nhim with blows of the rattan, without being under any apprehensions\nof vengeance in consequence. If a man dies, his nearest kinsmen\ngo out to requite his death by the death of some other individual,\ntaken at random. The rule is strictly enforced. For a dead man a man\nmust be killed; for a woman a woman; and for a child a child. Unless,\nindeed, it be a friend they encounter, the first victim that offers\nis killed. Latterly, however, owing to the unusual success attained by\nsome of them in representing the occurrence of death as an unavoidable\ndestiny, the custom is said to have fallen into desuetude; and the\nrelatives do not exact the satisfaction. This was easy in the case\nof the deceased being an ordinary person; but, to the present day,\nvengeance is required in the event of the death of a beloved child or\nwife. If a man kills a woman of another house, her nearest kinsman\nendeavors to kill a woman of the house of the murderer; but to the\nmurderer himself he does nothing; and the corpse of the victim thus\nslain as a death-offering is not buried, nor is its head cut off; and\nher family, in their turn, seek to avenge the death by murder. This\nis reckoned the most honorable course. Should the murderer, however,\nbe too strong to be so overcome, any weaker person, be it who it may,\nis slain in retaliation; and hence, probably, the comparatively small\nnumber of women.",
        "[Marriage.] Polygamy is permitted; but even the most courageous\nand skilful seldom or never have more than one wife. A young man\nwishing to marry commissions his father to treat with the father\nof the bride as to the price; which latterly has greatly increased;\nbut the average is ten bolos, costing from four to six reals each,\nand about $12 in cash; and the acquisition of so large a sum by\nthe sale of wax, resin, and abacá, often takes the bridegroom two\nyears. The bride-money goes partly to the father, and partly to the\nnearest relations; every one of whom has an equal interest. If there\nshould be many of them, almost nothing remains for the father, who\nhas to give a great feast, on which occasion much palm-wine is drunk.",
        "[Sexual crimes.] Any man using violence towards a girl is killed by\nher parents. If the girl was willing, and the father hears of it,\nhe agrees upon a day with the former, on which he is to bring the\nbride’s dowry; which should he refuse to do, he is caught by the\nrelations, bound to a tree, and whipped with a cane. Adultery is\nof most rare occurrence; but, when it does take place, the dowry is\nreturned either by the woman, who then acquires her freedom, or by\nthe seducer, whom she then follows. The husband has not the right to\ndetain her, if he takes the money, or even if he should refuse it;\nbut the latter contingency is not likely to arise, since that sum of\nmoney will enable him to buy for himself a new wife.",
        "[Basira ravine.] In the afternoon we reached a vast ravine, called\n\"Basira,” 973 meters above Uacloy, and about 1,134 meters above\nthe sea, extending from south-east to north-west between lofty,\nprecipitous ranges, covered with wood. Its base, which has an\ninclination of 33°, consists of a naked bed of rock, and, after every\nviolent rainfall, gives issue to a torrent of water, which discharges\nitself violently. Here we bivouacked; and the Igorots, in a very short\ntime, built a hut, and remained on the watch outside. At daybreak\nthe thermometer stood at 13.9° R. [150]",
        "[At the summit.] The road to the summit was very difficult on account\nof the slippery clay earth and the tough network of plants; but the\nlast five hundred feet were unexpectedly easy, the very steep summit\nbeing covered with a very thick growth of thinly leaved, knotted, mossy\nthibaudia, rhododendra, and other dwarf woods, whose innumerable tough\nbranches, running at a very small height along the ground and parallel\nto it, form a compact and secure lattice-work, by which one mounted\nupwards as on a slightly inclined ladder. The point which we reached *\n* * was evidently the highest spur of the horseshoe-shaped mountain\nside, which bounds the great ravine of Rungus on the north. The top\nwas hardly fifty paces in diameter, and so thickly covered with trees\nthat I have never seen its like; we had not room to stand. My active\nhosts, however, went at once to work, though the task of cutting a path\nthrough the wood involved severe labor, and, chopping off the branches,\nbuilt therewith, on the tops of the lopped trees, an observatory, from\nwhich I should have had a wide panoramic view, and an opportunity for\ntaking celestial altitudes, had not everything been enveloped in a\nthick mist. The neighboring volcanoes were visible only in glimpses,\nas well as San Miguel Bay and some lakes in the interior. Immediately\nafter sunset the thermometer registered 12.5° R. [151]",
        "[The descent.] On the following morning it was still overcast; and\nwhen, about ten o’clock, the clouds became thicker, we set out on\nour return. It was my intention to have passed the night in a rancho,\nin order next day to visit a solfatara which was said to be a day’s\njourney further; but my companions were so exhausted by fatigue that\nthey asked for at least a few hours’ rest.",
        "[Ferns and orchids.] On the upper slope I observed no palms with the\nexception of calamus; but polypodies (ferns) were very frequent, and\norchids surprisingly abundant. In one place all the trees were hung,\nat a convenient height, with flowering aërids; of which one could have\ncollected thousands without any trouble. The most beautiful plant\nwas a Medinella, of so delicate a texture that it was impossible to\npreserve it.",
        "[Carbonic acid spring.] Within a quarter of an hour north-east\nof Uacloy, a considerable spring of carbonic acid bursts from the\nground, depositing abundance of calcareous sinter. Our torches were\nquickly extinguished, and a fowl covered with a cigar-box died in\na few minutes, to the supreme astonishment of the Igorots, to whom\nthese phenomena were entirely new.",
        "[Farewell to mountaineers.] On the second day of rest, my poor hosts,\nwho had accompanied me back to Uacloy, still felt so weary that they\nwere not fit for any undertaking. With naked heads and bellies they\nsquatted in the burning sun in order to replenish their bodies with\nthe heat which they had lost during the bivouac on the summit; for\nthey are not allowed to drink wine. When I finally left them on the\nfollowing day, we had become such good friends that I was compelled\nto accept a tamed wild pig as a present. A troop of men and women\naccompanied me until they saw the glittering roofs of Maguiring,\nwhen, after the exchange of hearty farewells, they returned to their\nforests. The natives whom I had taken with me from Goa had proved\nso lazy and morose that nearly the whole task of making the path\nthrough the forest had fallen upon the Igorots. From sheer laziness\nthey threw away the drinking water of which they were the porters;\nand the Igorots were obliged to fetch water from a considerable\ndistance for our bivouac on the summit. In all my troublesome marches,\nI have always done better with Cimarrons than with the civilized\nnatives. The former I have found obliging, trustworthy, active and\nacquainted with localities, while the latter generally displayed the\nopposite qualities. It would, however, be unjust to form a conclusive\nopinion as to their comparative merits from these facts; for the\nwild people are at home when in the forest; what they do is done\nvoluntarily, and the stranger, when he possesses their confidence, is\ntreated as a guest. [Forced labor.] But the Filipinos are reluctant\ncompanions, Polistas, who, even when they receive a high rate of\nwages, consider that they are acting most honorably when they do as\nlittle as possible. At any rate, it is no pleasure to them to leave\ntheir village in order to become luggage-porters or beaters of roads\non fatiguing marches in impracticable districts, and to camp out in\nthe open air under every deprivation. For them, still more than for\nthe European peasant, repose is the most agreeable refreshment. The\nless comfort any one enjoys at home, the greater is the reluctance\nwith which he leaves it; and the same thing may be observed in Europe.",
        "[A petition for liquors.] As the Igorots were not permitted to\nhave cocoa-palms for the preparation of wine, vinegar and brandy,\nso that they might not infringe the monopoly of the government,\nthey presented me with a petition entreating me to obtain this\nfavor for them. The document was put together by a Filipino writer\nin so ludicrously confused a manner that I give it as a specimen of\nPhilippine clerkship. [152] At all events, it had the best of results,\nfor the petitioners were accorded twice as much as they had prayed for.",
        "[Winds and planting season.] The south-west monsoon lasts in this\nregion (district of Goa) from April to October. April is very calm\n(navegación de señoras). From June to August the south-west winds\nblow steadily; March, April, and May are the driest months; there are\nshifting winds in March and the beginning of April; while from October\nto December is the time of storms; “S. Francisco (4th October) brings\nbad weather.” Rice is planted in September and reaped in February.",
        "[Mt. Iriga.] From the Isarog I returned through Naga and Nabua to\nIriga, the ascent of which I at length accomplished.",
        "[The ascent.] The chief of the Montesinos had received daily rations\nfor twenty-two men, with whom he professed to make a road to the\nsummit; but when, on the evening of the third day, he came himself\nto Iriga, in order to fetch more provisions, on the pretext that\nthe work still required some time for execution, I explained that\nI should endeavor to ascend the mountain on the following morning,\nand requested him to act as guide. He consented, but disappeared,\ntogether with his companions, during the night; the Filipinos in\nthe tribunal having been good enough to hold out the prospect of\nsevere punishment in case the work performed should not correspond\nto the working days. After fruitless search for another guide,\nwe left Buhi in the afternoon, and passed the night in the rancho,\nwhere we had previously been so hospitably received. The fires were\nstill burning, but the inhabitants, on our approach, had fled. About\nsix o’clock on the following morning the ascent began. After we had\ngone through the forest, by availing ourselves of the path which we\nhad previously beaten, it led us through grass three or four feet\nin height, with keen-edged leaves; succeeded by cane, from seven\nto eight feet high, of the same habitat with our Arundo phragmites\n(but it was not in flower), which occupied the whole of the upper\npart of the mountain as far as the edge. Only in the ravine did the\ntrees attain any height. The lower declivities were covered with\naroids and ferns; towards the summit were tendrils and mosses; and\nhere I found a beautiful, new, and peculiarly shaped orchid. [153]\nThe Cimarrons had cut down some cane; and, beating down our road for\nourselves with bolos, we arrived at the summit a little before ten\no’clock. It was very foggy. In the hope of a clear evening or morning\nI caused a hut to be erected, for which purpose the cane was well\nfitted. The natives were too lazy to erect a lodging for themselves,\nor to procure wood for a watchfire. They squatted on the ground,\nsqueezed close to one another to warm themselves, ate cold rice,\nand suffered thirst because none of them would fetch water. Of the\ntwo water-carriers whom I had taken with me, one had “inadvertently\"\nupset his water on the road, and the other had thrown it away “because\nhe thought we should not require it.”",
        "[Altitude.] I found the highest points of the Iriga to be 1,212\nmeters, 1,120 meters above the surface of the Buhi Lake. From Buhi\nI went to Batu.",
        "[Changes in Batu Lake.] The Batu Lake (one hundred eleven meters\nabove the sea) had sunk lower since my last visit in February. The\ncarpet of algae had increased considerably in breadth, its upper\nedge being in many places decomposed; and the lower passed gradually\ninto a thick consistency of putrid water-plants (charae, algae,\npontederiae, valisneriae, pistiae, etc.), which encompassed the\nsurface of the water so that only through a few gaps could one reach\nthe bank. Right across the mouth of the Quinali lies, in the lake,\na bar of black mud, the softest parts of which were indicated by some\ninsignificant channels of water. As we could not get over the bar in\na large boat, two small skiffs were bound together with a matting of\nbamboo, and provided with an awning. By means of this contrivance,\nwhich was drawn by three strong carabaos (the whole body of men with\nevident delight and loud mirth wading knee-deep in the black mud\nand assisting by pushing behind) we succeeded, as if on a sledge,\nin getting over the obstacle into the river; which on my first visit\noverflowed the fields in many places, till the huts of the natives\nrose out of the water like so many ships: but now (in June) not one\nof its channels was full. We were obliged in consequence to continue\nour sledge journey until we were near to Quinali.",
        "[Ascent of Mt. Mazaraga.] At Ligao I alighted at a friendly Spaniard’s,\na great part of the place, together with the tribunal and convent,\nhaving been burnt down since my last visit. After making the necessary\npreparations, I went in the evening to Barayong, a little rancho\nof Cimarrons at the foot of the Mazaraga, and, together with its\ninhabitants, ascended the mountain on the following morning. The\nwomen also accompanied us for some distance, and kept the company in\ngood humor; and when, on the road, a Filipino who had been engaged\nfor the purpose wished to give up carrying a bamboo full of water,\nand, throwing it away, ran off, an old woman stepped forward in his\nstead, and dragged the water cheerfully along up to the summit. This\nmountain was moister than any I had ever ascended, the Semeru in\nJava, in some respects, excepted; and half-way up I found some rotten\nrafflesia. [154] Two miserable-looking Cimarron dogs drove a young\nstag towards us, which was slain by one of the people with a blow\nof his bolo. The path ceased a third of the way up, but it was not\ndifficult to get through the wood. The upper portion of the mountain,\nhowever, being thickly overgrown with cane, again presented great\nobstacles. About twelve we reached the summit-level, which, pierced by\nno crater, is almost horizontal, smoothly arched, and thickly covered\nwith cane. [Altitude.] Its height is 1,354 meters. In a short time the\nindefatigable Cimarrons had built a fine large hut of cane: one room\nfor myself and the baggage, a large assembly-room for the people,\nand a special apartment for cooking. Unfortunately the cane was so\nwet that it would not burn. In order to procure firewood to cook the\nrice, thick branches were got out of the wood, and their comparatively\ndry pith extracted with great labor. The lucifer-matches, too, were\nso damp that the phosphorus was rubbed away in friction; but, being\ncollected on blotting-paper, and kneaded together with the sulphurous\nend of the match-wood, it became dry and was kindled by friction. Not\na trace of solid rock was to be seen. All was obstructed by a thick\novergrowth from where the path ceased, and the ground covered with\na dense bed of damp wood-earth. The following morning was fine, and\nshowed a wide panorama; but, before I had completed my drawing, it\nagain became misty; and as, after several hours of waiting, the heavens\nwere overspread with thick rain-clouds, we set out on our return.",
        "[Butterflies.] Numerous butterflies swarmed around the summit. We\ncould, however, catch only a few, as the passage over the cane-stubble\nwas too difficult for naked feet; and, the badly-stitched soles of\ntwo pairs of new shoes which I had brought from Manila having dropped\noff some time before I reached the summit, I was compelled to perform\nthe journey to Ligao barefoot.",
        "[Native contempt for private Spaniards.] On the following day my\nSpanish host went twice to the tribunal to procure the carabao carts\nwhich were necessary for the furtherance of my collections. His\ncourteous request was unsuccessful; but the command of the parish\npriest, who personally informed the Gobernadorcillo in his house,\nwas immediately obeyed. The Filipino authorities have, as a rule, but\nlittle respect for private Spanish people, and treat them not seldom\nwith open contempt. An official recommendation from the alcalde is\nusually effectual, but not in all the provinces; for many alcaldes do\nhurt to their own authority by engaging the assistance or connivance of\nthe native magistrates in the furtherance of their personal interests.",
        "[Giant bats.] I here shot some panikes, great bats with wings nearly\nfive feet wide when extended, which in the day time hang asleep from\nthe branches of trees, and, among them, two mothers with their young\nsucking ones uninjured. It was affecting to see how the little animals\nclung more and more firmly to the bodies of their dying parents,\nand how tenderly they embraced them even after these were dead. The\napparent feeling, however, was only self-interest at bottom, for,\nwhen their store of milk was exhausted, the old ones were treated\nwithout respect, like empty bottles. As soon as the young ones were\nseparated, they fed on bananas, and lived several days, until I at\nlength placed them in spirits.",
        "[A muddy dry season.] Early in the morning I rode on the priest’s\nhorse to Legaspi, and in the evening through deep mud to the alcalde\nat Albay. We were now (June) in the middle of the so-called dry season,\nbut it rained almost every day; and the road between Albay and Legaspi\nwas worse than ever. During my visit information arrived from the\ncommandant of the faluas on the south coast that, as he was pursuing\ntwo pirate vessels, [Power of Moro pirates.] six others suddenly made\ntheir appearance, in order to cut off his return; for which reason he\nbad quickly made his way back. The faluas are very strongly manned, and\nprovided with cannon, but the crews furnished by the localities on the\ncoast are entirely unpractised in the use of fire-arms, and moreover\nhold the Moros in such dread that, if the smallest chance offers of\nflight, they avail themselves of it to ensure their safety by making\nfor the land. The places on the coast, destitute of other arms than\nwooden pikes, were completely exposed to the pirates, who had firmly\nestablished themselves in Catanduanes, Biri, and several small islands,\nand seized ships with impunity, or robbed men on the land. Almost daily\nfresh robberies and murders were announced from the villages on the\nshore. During a plundering expedition the men caught are employed at\nthe oars and at its close sold as slaves; and, on the division of the\nspoil, one of the crew falls to the share of the dato (Moro chief) who\nfitted out the vessel. [155] The coasting vessels in these waters, it\nis true, are mostly provided with artillery, but it is generally placed\nin the hold of the ship, as no one on board knows how to use it. If\nthe cannon be upon deck, either the powder or the shot is wanting;\nand the captain promises to be better prepared next time. [156] The\nalcalde reported the outrages of the pirates by every post to Manila,\nas well as the great injury done to trade, and spoke of the duty of the\n[No protection from Government.] Government to protect its subjects,\nespecially as the latter were not permitted to use fire-arms; [157] and\nfrom the Bisayan Islands came the same cry for help. The Government,\nhowever, was powerless against the evil. If the complaints were indeed\nvery urgent, they would send a steamer into the waters most infested;\nbut it hardly ever came in sight of pirates, although the latter were\ncarrying on their depredations close in front and behind.",
        "[Government steamer easily eluded.] At Samars, the principal town,\nI subsequently met with a Government steamer, which for fourteen days\npast had been nominally engaged in cruising against the pirates; but\nthe latter, generally forewarned by their spies, perceive the smoke\nof the steamers sufficiently soon to slip away in their flat boats;\nand the officers knew beforehand that their cruise would have no\nother result than to show the distressed provinces that their outcry\nwas not altogether unnoticed. [158]",
        "[Steam gunboats more successful.] Twenty small steam gunboats of light\ndraught had shortly before been ordered from England, and were nearly\nready. The first two indeed arrived soon after in Manila (they had to\nbe transported in pieces round the Cape), and were to be followed by\nthe rest; and they were at one time almost successful in delivering\nthe archipelago from these burdensome pests; [159] at least, from\nthe proscribed Moros who came every year from the Sulu Sea, mostly\nfrom the island of Tawitawi, arriving in May at the Bisayas, and\ncontinuing their depredations in the archipelago until the change\nof the monsoon in October or November compelled them to return.\n[160] [Renegades join pirates and bandits.] In the Philippines they\ngained new recruits among vagabonds, deserters, runaway criminals,\nand ruined spendthrifts; and from the same sources were made up the\nbands of highway robbers (tulisanes), which sometimes started up,\nand perpetuated acts of extraordinary daring. Not long before my\narrival they had made an inroad into a suburb of Manila, and engaged\nwith the military in the highways. Some of the latter are regularly\nemployed in the service against the tulisanes. The robbers are not,\nas a rule, cruel to their victims when no opposition is offered.  [161]",
        "[Plants from Berlin.] In Legaspi I found awaiting me several chests\nwith tin lining, which had been sixteen months on their passage by\noverland route, instead of seven weeks, having been conveyed from\nBerlin by way of Trieste, on account of the Italian war. Their\ncontents, which had been intended for use in the Philippines\nexclusively, were now for the most part useless. In one chest there\nwere two small flasks with glass stoppers, one filled with moist\ncharcoal, and the other with moist clay, both containing seeds of the\nVictoria Regia and tubers of red and blue nymphae (water-lily). Those\nin the first flask were spoiled, as might have been expected; but in\nthat filled with moist clay two tubers had thrown out shoots of half an\ninch in length, and appeared quite sound. I planted them at once, and\nin a few days vigorous leaves were developed. One of these beautiful\nplants, which had been originally intended for the Buitenzorg Garden\nin Java, remained in Legaspi; the other I sent to Manila, where,\non my return, I saw it in full bloom. In the charcoal two Victoria\nseeds had thrown out roots above an inch in length, which had rotted\noff. Most likely they had been torn up by the custom-house inspectors,\nand had afterwards rotted, for the neck of the bottle was broken,\nand the charcoal appeared as if it had been stirred. I communicated\nthe brilliant result of his mode of packing to the Inspector of the\nBotanical Gardens at Berlin, who made a second consignment direct\nto Java, which arrived in the best condition; so that not only the\nVictoria, but also the one which had been derived in Berlin from an\nAfrican father and an Asiatic mother, now adorn the water-basins of\nJava with red pond-roses (the latter plants probably those of the\nPhilippines also).",
        "[Carpentering difficulties.] Being compelled by the continuous rain to\ndry my collections in two ovens before packing them, I found that my\nservant had burned the greater part, so that the remains found a place\nin a roomy chest which I purchased for a dollar at an auction. This\nunfortunately lacked a lid; to procure which I was obliged, in the\nfirst place, to liberate a carpenter who had been imprisoned for a\nsmall debt; secondly, to advance money for the purchase of a board\nand the redemption of his tools out of pawn; and even then the work,\nwhen it was begun, was several times broken off because previous claims\nof violent creditors had to be discharged by labor. In five days the\nlid was completed, at the cost of three dollars. It did not last long,\nhowever, for in Manila I had to get it replaced by a new one.",
        "[Off to Samar.] At Legaspi I availed myself of an opportunity to reach\nthe island of Samar in a small schooner. It is situated south-east\nfrom Luzon, on the farther side of the Strait of San Bernardino,\nwhich is three leagues in breadth. At the moment of my departure,\nto my great regret, my servant left me, “that he might rest a little\nfrom his fatigue,” for Pepe was good-natured, very skilful, and\nalways even-tempered. [Losing a clever assistant.] He had learned\nmuch from the numerous Spanish soldiers and sailors resident in\nCavite, his native place, where he used to be playfully called the\n\"Spaniard of Cavite.” Roving from one place to another was his\ndelight; and he quickly acquired acquaintances. He knew especially\nhow to gain the favor of the ladies, for he possessed many social\naccomplishments, being equally able to play the guitar and to milk\nthe carabao-cows. When we came to a pueblo, where a mestiza, or even a\n\"daughter of the country” (creole), dwelt, he would, when practicable,\nask permission to milk a cow; and after bringing the señora some\nof the milk, under pretext of being the interpreter of my wishes,\nhe would maintain such a flow of ingeniously courteous conversation,\npraising the beauty and grace of the lady, and most modestly allowing\nhis prodigious travelling adventures to be extracted from him, that\nboth knight and esquire beamed with brilliant radiance. A present\nwas always welcome, and brought us many a little basket of oranges;\nand carabao milk is excellent with chocolate: but it seemed as if\none seldom has the opportunity of milking a cow. Unfortunately Pepe\ndid not like climbing mountains, and when he was to have gone with\nme he either got the stomach-ache or gave away my strong shoes, or\nallowed them to be stolen; the native ones, however, being allowed\nto remain untouched, for he knew well that they were fit only for\nriding, and derived comfort from the fact. In company with me he\nworked quickly and cheerfully; but, when alone, it became tedious to\nhim. Particularly he found friends, who hindered him, and then he would\nabandon his skinning of the birds, which therefore became putrid and\nhad to be thrown away. Packing was still more disagreeable to him, and\nconsequently he did it as quickly as possible, though not always with\nsufficient care, as on one occasion he tied up, in one and the same\nbundle, shoes, arsenic-soap, drawings, and chocolate. Notwithstanding\ntrifling faults of this kind, he was very useful and agreeable to me;\nbut he did not go willingly to such an uncivilized island as Samar;\nand when he received his wages in full for eight months all in a lump,\nand so became a small capitalist, he could not resist the temptation\nto rest a little from his labors.",
        "[Samar.] The island of Samar, which is of nearly rhomboidal outline,\nand with few indentations on its coasts, stretches from the north-west\nto the south-east from 12° 37’ to 10° 54’ N.; its mean length being\ntwenty-two miles, its breadth eleven, and its area two hundred and\ntwenty square miles. It is separated on the south by the small strait\nof San Juanico from the island of Leyte, with which it was formerly\nunited into one province. At the present time each island has its\nseparate governor.",
        "[Former names.] By the older authors the island is called Tendaya,\nIbabao, and also Achan and Filipina. In later times the eastern\nside was called Ibabao, and the western Samar, which is now the\nofficial denomination for the whole island, the eastern shore being\ndistinguished as the Contracosta. [162]",
        "[Seasons and weather.] As on the eastern coasts of Luzon, the\nnorth-east monsoon here exceeds that from the south-west in duration\nand force, the violence of the latter being arrested by the islands\nlying to the southwest, while the north-east winds break against\nthe coasts of these easterly islands with their whole force, and the\nadditional weight of the body of water which they bring with them from\nthe open ocean. In October winds fluctuating between north-west and\nnorth-east occur; but the prevalent ones are northerly. In the middle\nof November the north-east is constant; and it blows, with but little\nintermission, from the north until April. This is likewise the rainy\nseason, December and January being the wettest, when it sometimes\nrains for fourteen days without interruption. In Lauang, on the north\ncoast, the rainy season lasts from October to the end of December. From\nJanuary to April it is dry; May, June, and July are rainy; and August\nand September, again, are dry; so that here there are two wet and\ntwo dry seasons in the year. From October to January violent storms\n(baguios or typhoons) sometimes occur. Beginning generally with a\nnorth wind, they pass to the north-west, accompanied by a little rain,\nthen back to the north, and with increasing violence to the north-east\nand east, where they acquire their greatest power, and then moderate\nto the south. Sometimes, however, they change rapidly from the east\nto the south, in which quarter they first acquire their greatest force.",
        "[Winds and storms.] From the end of March to the middle of June\ninconstant easterly winds (N.E.E. and S.E.) prevail, with a very\nheavy sea on the east coast. May is usually calm; but in May and\nJune there are frequent thunderstorms, introducing the south-west\nmonsoon, which though it extends through the months of July, August,\nand September, is not so constant as the north-east. The last-named\nthree months constitute the dry season, which, however, is often\ninterrupted by thunderstorms. Not a week, indeed, passes without rain;\nand in many years a storm arises every afternoon. At this season of\nthe year ships can reach the east coast; but during the north-east\nmonsoon navigation there is impossible. These general circumstances\nare subject to many local deviations, particularly on the south and\nwest coasts, where the uniformity of the air currents is disturbed\nby the mountainous islands lying in front of them. According to\nthe Estado geografico of 1855, an extraordinarily high tide, called\ndolo, occurs every year at the change of the monsoon in September or\nOctober. It rises sometimes sixty or seventy feet, and dashes itself\nwith fearful violence against the south and east coasts, doing great\ndamage, but not lasting for any length of time. The climate of Samar\nand Leyte appears to be very healthy on the coasts; in fact, to be\nthe best of all the islands of the archipelago. Dysentery, diarrhoea,\nand fever occur less frequently than in Luzon, and Europeans also\nare less subject to their attacks than in that place.",
        "[Only the coast settled.] The civilized natives live almost solely\non its coasts, and there are also Bisayans who differ in speech and\nmanners from the Bicols in about the same degree that the latter do\nfrom the Tagalogs. Roads and villages are almost entirely wanting\nin the interior, which is covered with a thick wood, and affords\nsustenance to independent tribes, who carry on a little tillage\n(vegetable roots and mountain rice), and collect the products of the\nwoods, particularly resin, honey, and wax, in which the island is\nvery rich.",
        "[A tedious but eventful voyage.] On the 3rd of July we lost sight\nof Legaspi, and, detained by frequent calms, crawled as far as\nPoint Montufar, on the northern edge of Albay, then onwards to the\nsmall island of Viri, and did not reach Lauang before evening of\nthe 5th. The mountain range of Bacon (the Pocdol of Coello), which\non my previous journeys had been concealed by night or mist, now\nrevealed itself to us in passing as a conical mountain; and beside\nit towered a very precipitous, deeply-cleft mountain-side, apparently\nthe remnant of a circular range. After the pilot, an old Filipino and\nnative of the country, who had made the journey frequently before,\nhad conducted us, to begin with, to a wrong port, he ran the vessel\nfast on to the bar, although there was sufficient water to sail into\nthe harbor conveniently.",
        "[Lauang.] The district of Lauang (Lahuan), which is encumbered with\nmore than four thousand five hundred inhabitants, is situated at an\naltitude of forty feet, on the south-west shore of the small island\nof the same name, which is separated from Samar by an arm of the\nCatubig. According to a widely-spread tradition, the settlement was\noriginally in Samar itself, in the middle of the rice-fields, which\ncontinue to the present day in that place, until the repeated inroads\nof sea-pirates drove the inhabitants, in spite of the inconvenience\nattending it, to protect themselves by settling on the south coast\nof the little island, which rises steeply out of the sea. [163] The\nlatter consists of almost horizontal banks of tufa, from eight to\ntwelve inches in thickness. The strata being continually eaten away\nby the waves at low watermark, the upper layers break off; and thus\nthe uppermost parts of the strata, which are of a tolerably uniform\nthickness, are cleft by vertical fissures, and look like the walls of\na fortress. Pressed for space, the church and the convent have taken\nup every level bit of the rock at various heights; and the effect of\nthis accommodation of architecture to the requirements of the ground,\nthough not designed by the architect, is most picturesque.",
        "[Deterioration in the town.] The place is beautifully situated; but the\nhouses are not so frequently as formerly surrounded by little gardens\nwhile there is a great want of water, and foul odors prevail. Two or\nthree scanty springs afford a muddy, brackish water, almost at the\nlevel of the sea, with which the indolent people are content so that\nthey have just enough. Wealthy people have their water brought from\nSamar, and the poorer classes are sometimes compelled, by the drying-up\nof the springs, to have recourse to the same place. The spring-water\nis not plentiful for bathing purposes; and, sea-bathing not being in\nfavor, the people consequently are very dirty. Their clothing is the\nsame as in Luzon; but the women wear no tapis, only a camisa (a short\nchemise, hardly covering the breast), and a saya, mostly of coarse,\nstiff guinara, which forms ugly folds, and when not colored black\nis very transparent. But dirt and a filthy existence form a better\nscreen than opaque garments. The inhabitants of Lauang rightly,\nindeed, enjoy the reputation of being very idle. Their industry is\nlimited to a little tillage, even fishing being so neglected that\nfrequently there is a scarcity of fish. In the absence of roads by\nland, there is hardly any communication by water; and trade is mostly\ncarried on by mariners from Catbalogan, who exchange the surplus of\nthe harvests for other produce.",
        "From the convent a view is had of part of the island of Samar, the\nmountain forms of which appear to be a continuation of the horizontal\nstrata. In the centre of the district, at the distance of some miles,\na table mountain, famous in the history of the country, towers\naloft. [The Palapat revolt.] The natives of the neighboring village\nof Palapat retreated to it after having killed their priest, a too\ncovetous Jesuit father, and for years carried on a guerilla warfare\nwith the Spaniards until they were finally overpowered by treachery.",
        "[Pirate outrages.] The interior of the country is difficult to\ntraverse from the absence of roads, and the coasts are much infested\nby pirates. Quite recently several pontins and four schooners,\nladen with abacá, were captured, and the crews cruelly murdered,\ntheir bodies having been cut to pieces. This, however, was opposed\nto their general practice, for the captives are usually employed at\nthe oars during the continuance of the foray, and afterwards sold as\nslaves in the islands of the Sulu sea. It was well that we did not\nencounter the pirates, for, although we carried four small cannons\non board, nobody understood how to use them. [164]",
        "[Electing officers.]  The governor, who was expected to conduct the\nelection of the district officials in person, but was prevented\nby illness, sent a deputy. As the annual elections are conducted\nin the same manner over the whole country, that at which I was\npresent may be taken as typical of the rest. It took place in the\ncommon hall; the governor (or his deputy) sitting at the table,\nwith the pastor on his right hand, and the clerk on his left–the\nlatter also acting as interpreter; while Cabezas de Barangay, the\ngobernadorcillo, and those who had previously filled the office, took\ntheir places all together on benches. First of all, six cabezas and\nas many gobernadorcillos are chosen by lot as electors; the actual\ngobernadorcillo is the thirteenth, and the rest quit the hall. After\nthe reading of the statutes by the president, who exhorts the electors\nto the conscientious performance of their duty, the latter advance\nsingly to the table, and write three names on a piece of paper. Unless\na valid protest be made either by the parish priest or by the electors,\nthe one who has the most votes is forthwith named gobernadorcillo for\nthe coming year, subject to the approval of the superior jurisdiction\nat Manila; which, however, always consents, for the influence of the\npriest would provide against a disagreeable election. The election of\nthe other functionaries takes place in the same manner, after the new\ngobernadorcillo has been first summoned into the hall, in order that,\nif he have any important objections to the officers then about to be\nelected, he may be able to make them. The whole affair was conducted\nvery quietly and with dignity. [165]",
        "[Unsatisfactory forced labor.] On the following morning, accompanied\nby the obliging priest, who was followed by nearly all the boys\nof the village, I crossed over in a large boat to Samar. Out of\neleven strong baggage porters whom the governor’s representative had\nselected for me, four took possession of some trifling articles and\nsped away with them, three others hid themselves in the bush, and\nfour had previously decamped at Lauang. The baggage was divided and\ndistributed amongst the four porters who were detained, and the little\nboys who had accompanied us for their own pleasure. We followed the\nsea-shore in a westerly direction, and at a very late hour reached the\nnearest visita (a suburban chapel and settlement) where the priest\nwas successful, after much difficulty, in supplying the places of\nthe missing porters. On the west side of the mouth of the Pambujan\na neck of land projects into the sea, which is a favorite resort\nof the [A pirate base.] sea-pirates, who from their shelter in the\nwood command the shore which extends in a wide curve on both sides,\nand forms the only communication between Lauang and Catarman. Many\ntravellers had already been robbed in this place; and the father, who\nwas now accompanying me thus far, had, with the greatest difficulty,\nescaped the same danger only a few weeks before.",
        "The last part of our day’s journey was performed very cautiously. A\nmessenger who had been sent on had placed boats at all the mouths of\nrivers, and, as hardly any other Europeans besides ecclesiastics are\nknown in this district, I was taken in the darkness for a Capuchin in\ntravelling attire; the men lighting me with torches during the passage,\nand the women pressing forward to kiss my hand. I passed the night\non the road, and on the following day reached Catarman (Caladman on\nCoello’s map), a clean, spacious locality numbering 6,358 souls, at\nthe mouth of the river of the same name. Six pontins from Catbalogan\nawaited their cargoes of rice for Albay. The inhabitants of the north\ncoast are too indifferent sailors to export their products themselves,\nand leave it to the people of [Catbalogan monopoly of interisland\ntraffic.] Catbalogan, who, having no rice-fields, are obliged to find\nemployment for their activity in other places.",
        "[A changed river and a new town.] The river Catarman formerly emptied\nfurther to the east, and was much choked with mud. In the year 1851,\nafter a continuous heavy rain, it worked for itself, in the loose\nsoil which consists of quartz sand and fragments of mussels, a new\nand shorter passage to the sea–the present harbor, in which ships\nof two hundred tons can load close to the land; but in doing so it\ndestroyed the greater part of the village, as well as the stone church\nand the priest’s residence. In the new convent there are two salons,\none 16.2 by 8.8, the other 9 by 7.6 paces in dimensions, boarded with\nplanks from a single branch of a dipterocarpus (guiso). The pace is\nequivalent to 30 inches; and, assuming the thickness of the boards,\ninclusive of waste, to be one inch, this would give a solid block of\nwood as high as a table (two and one-half feet), the same in breadth,\neighteen feet in length, and of about one hundred and ten cubic\nfeet. [166] The houses are enclosed in gardens; but some of them only\nby fencing, within which weeds luxuriate. At the rebuilding of the\nvillage, after the great flood of water, the laying out of gardens\nwas commanded; but the industry which is required to preserve them is\noften wanting. Pasture grounds extend themselves, on the south side\nof the village, covered with fine short grass; but, with the exception\nof some oxen and sheep belonging to the priest, there are no cattle.",
        "[Up the river.] Still without servants, I proceeded with my baggage in\ntwo small boats up the river, on both sides of which rice-fields and\ncoco-groves extended; but the latter, being concealed by a thick border\nof Nipa palms and lofty cane, are only visible occasionally through\nthe gaps. The sandy banks, at first flat, became gradually steeper,\nand the rock soon showed itself close at hand, with firm banks of sandy\nclay containing occasional traces of indistinguishable petrifactions. A\nsmall mussel [167] has pierced the clay banks at the water-line, in\nsuch number that they look like honeycombs. About twelve we cooked\nour rice in an isolated hut, amongst friendly people. The women whom\nwe surprised in dark ragged clothing of guinara drew back ashamed,\nand soon after appeared in clean chequered sayas, with earrings of\nbrass and tortoise-shell combs. When I drew a little naked girl, the\nmother forced her to put on a garment. About two we again stepped into\nthe boat, and after rowing the whole night reached a small visita,\nCobocobo, about nine in the forenoon. The rowers had worked without\ninterruption for twenty-four hours, exclusive of the two hours’\nrest at noon, and though somewhat tired were in good spirits.",
        "[Salta Sangley ridge.] At half-past two we set out on the road over\nthe Salta Sangley (Chinese leap) to Tragbucan, which, distant about a\nmile in a straight line, is situated at the place where the Calbayot,\nwhich empties on the west coast at Point Hibaton, becomes navigable for\nsmall boats. By means of these two rivers and the short but troublesome\nroad, a communication exists between the important stations of Catarman\non the north coast, and Calbayot on the west coast. The road, which\nat its best part is a small path in the thick wood uninvaded by the\nsun, and frequently is only a track, passes over slippery ridges of\nclay, disappearing in the mud puddles in the intervening hollows, and\nsometimes running into the bed of the brooks. The watershed between\nthe Catarman and Calbayot is formed by the Salta Sangley already\nmentioned, a flat ridge composed of banks of clay and sandstone,\nwhich succeed one another ladder-wise downwards on both its sides,\nand from which the water collected at the top descends in little\ncascades. In the most difficult places rough ladders of bamboo are\nfixed. I counted fifteen brooks on the north-east side which feed the\nCatarman, and about the same number of feeders of the Calbayot on the\nsouth-west side. About forty minutes past four we reached the highest\npoint of the Salta Sangley, about ninety feet above the sea; and at\nhalf-past six we got to a stream, the highest part of the Calbayot,\nin the bed of which we wandered until its increasing depth forced us,\nin the dark, laboriously to beat out our path through the underwood\nto its bank; and about eight o’clock we found ourselves opposite the\nvisita Tragbucan. The river at this place was already six feet deep,\nand there was not a boat. After shouting entreaties and threats for\na long time, the people, who were startled out of sleep by a revolver\nshot, agreed to construct a raft of bamboo, on which they put us and\nour baggage. The little place, which consists of only a few poor huts,\nis prettily situated, surrounded as it is by wooded hillocks on a\nplateau of sand fifty feet above the reed-bordered river.",
        "[On the Calbayot River.] Thanks to the activity of the teniente of\nCatarman who accompanied me, a boat was procured without delay, so\nthat we were able to continue our journey about seven o’clock. The\nbanks were from twenty to forty feet high; and, with the exception of\nthe cry of some rhinoceros birds which fluttered from bough to bough\non the tops of the trees, we neither heard nor saw a trace of animal\nlife. About half-past eleven we reached Taibago, a small visita,\nand about half-past one a similar one, Magubay; and after two hours’\nrest at noon, about five o’clock, we got into a current down which\nwe skilfully floated, almost without admitting any water. The river,\nwhich up to this point is thirty feet broad, and on account of many\nprojecting branches of trees difficult to navigate, here is twice as\nbroad. About eleven at night we reached the sea, and in a complete\ncalm rowed for the distance of a league along the coast to Calbayot,\nthe convent at which place affords a commanding view of the islands\nlying before it.",
        "A thunderstorm obliged us to postpone the journey to the chief town,\nCatbalogan (or Catbalonga), which was seven leagues distant, until\nthe afternoon. In a long boat, formed out of the stem of one tree,\nand furnished with outriggers, we travelled along the shore, which\nis margined by a row of low-wooded hills with many small visitas;\nand as night was setting in we rounded the point of Napalisan,\na rock of trachytic conglomerate shaped by perpendicular fissures\nwith rounded edges into a series of projections like towers,\nwhich rises up out of the sea to the height of sixty feet, like\na knight’s castle. [Catbalogan.] At night we reached Catbalogan,\nthe chief town of the island, with a population of six thousand,\nwhich is picturesquely situated in the middle of the western border,\nin a little bay surrounded by islands and necks of land, difficult\nto approach and, therefore, little guarded. Not a single vessel was\nanchored in the harbor.",
        "The houses, many of which are of boards, are neater than those\nin Camarines; and the people, though idle, are more modest, more\nhonorable, more obliging, and of cleaner habits, than the inhabitants\nof South Luzon. Through the courtesy of the governor I quickly obtained\na roomy dwelling, and a servant who understood Spanish. [An ingenious\nmechanic.] Here I also met a very intelligent Filipino who had acquired\ngreat skill in a large variety of crafts. With the simplest tools he\nimproved in many points on my instruments and apparatus, the purpose\nof which he quickly comprehended to my entire satisfaction, and gave\nmany proofs of considerable intellectual ability.",
        "[The flying monkey.] In Samar the flying monkey or lemur (the kaguang\nof the Bisayans–galeopithecus) is not rare. These animals, which are\nof the size of the domestic cat, belong to the quadrumana; but, like\nthe flying squirrels, they are provided with a bird-like membrane,\nwhich, commencing at the neck, and passing over the fore and hinder\nlimbs, reaches to the tail; by means of which they are able to glide\nfrom one tree to another at a very obtuse angle. [168] Body and\nmembrane are clothed with a very short fur, which nearly equals the\nchinchilla in firmness and softness, and is on that account in great\nrequest. While I was there, six live kaguangs arrived as a present for\nthe priest (three light grey, one dark brown, and two greyish brown;\nall with irregularly distributed spots); and from these I secured a\nlittle female with her young.",
        "[A hasty and unfounded judgment.] It appeared to be a very harmless,\nawkward animal. When liberated from its fetters, it remained lying\non the ground with all its four limbs stretched out, and its belly\nin contact with the earth, and then hopped in short awkward leaps,\nwithout thereby raising itself from the ground, to the nearest wall,\nwhich was of planed boards. Arrived there, it felt about it for a long\ntime with the sharp claw, which is bent inwards, of its fore-hand,\nuntil at length it realized the impossiblity of climbing it at any\npart. It succeeded by means of a corner or an accidental crevice in\nclimbing a foot upwards, and fell down again immediately, because it\nhad abandoned the comparatively secure footing of its hinder limbs\nbefore its fore-claws had obtained a firm hold. It received no hurt,\nas the violence of the fall was broken by the flying membrane which\nwas rapidly extended. These attempts, which were continued with steady\nperseverance, showed an astonishing deficiency of judgment, the animal\nendeavoring to do much more than was in its power to accomplish. All\nits endeavors, therefore, were unsuccessful, though made without\ndoing itself any hurt–thanks to the parachute with which Nature\nhad provided it. Had the kaguang not been in the habit of relying\nso entirely on this convenient contrivance, it probably would have\nexercised its judgment to a greater extent, and formed a more correct\nestimate of its ability. The animal repeated its fruitless efforts so\noften that I no longer took any notice of it, and after some time it\ndisappeared: but I found it again in a dark corner, under the roof,\nwhere it would probably have waited for the night in order to continue\nits flight. Evidently it had succeeded in reaching the upper edge of\nthe boarded wall by squeezing its body between this and the elastic\ncovering of bamboo hurdle-work which lay firmly imposed upon it;\nso that the poor creature, which I had rashly concluded was stupid\nand awkward, had, under the circumstances, manifested the greatest\npossible skill, prudence, and perseverance.",
        "[A promise of rare animals and wild people.] A priest who was\npresent on a visit from Calbigan promised me so many wonders in his\ndistrict–abundance of the rarest animals, and Cimarrones uncivilized\nin the highest degree–that I accompanied him, on the following day,\nin his journey home. In an hour after our departure we reached the\nlittle island of Majava, which consists of perpendicular strata of\na hard, fine-grained, volcanic tufa, with small, bright crystals of\nhornblende. The island of Buat (on Coello’s map) is called by our\nmariners Tubigan. In three hours we reached Umauas, a dependency\nof Calbigan. It is situated, fifty feet above the sea, in a bay,\nbefore which (as is so often the case on this coast) a row of small\npicturesque islands succeed one another, and is exactly four leagues\nfrom Catbalogan. But Calbigan, which we reached towards evening, is\nsituated two leagues N.N.E. from Umauas, surrounded by rice-fields,\nforty feet above the river of the same name, and almost a league and\na half from its mouth. A tree with beautiful violet-blue panicles\nof blossoms is especially abundant on the banks of the Calbigan,\nand supplies a most valuable wood for building purposes in the\nPhilippines. It is considered equal to teak, like which it belongs\nto the class verbenaceae; and its inland name is [Molave.] molave\n(Vitex geniculata, Blanco).",
        "[Serpent-charmers.] According to the statements of credible men,\nthere are serpent-tamers in this country. They are said to pipe the\nserpents out of their holes, directing their movements, and stopping\nand handling them at will, without being injured by them. The most\nfamous individual amongst them, however, had been carried off by\nthe sea-pirates a short time before; another had run away to the\nCimarronese in the mountains; and the third, whose reputation did not\nappear to be rightly established, accompanied me on my excursion,\nbut did not justify the representations of his friends. He caught\ntwo poisonous serpents, [169] which we encountered on the road, by\ndexterously seizing them immediately behind the head, so that they were\nincapable of doing harm; and, when he commanded them to lie still,\nhe took the precaution of placing his foot on their necks. In the\nchase I hurt my foot so severely against a sharp-pointed branch which\nwas concealed by the mud that I was obliged to return to Catbalogan\nwithout effecting my object. The inhabitants of Calbigan are considered\nmore active and circumspect than those on the west coast, and they are\npraised for their honesty. I found them very skilful; and they seemed\nto take an evident pleasure in making collections and preparing plants\nand animals, so that I would gladly have taken with me a servant from\nthe place; but they are so reluctant to leave their village that all\nthe priest’s efforts to induce one to ride with us were fruitless.",
        "[A coral garden.] At a short distance north-west from Catbalogan a most\nluxuriant garden of corals is to be observed in less than two fathoms,\nat the ebb. On a yellow carpet of calcareous polyps and sponges,\ngroups of leather-like stalks, finger-thick, lift themselves up like\nstems of vegetable growth; their upper ends thickly covered with polyps\n(Sarcophyton pulmo Esp.), which display their roses of tentacula wide\nopen, and resplendent with the most beautiful varying colors, looking,\nin fact, like flowers in full bloom. Very large serpulites extend\nfrom their calcareous tubes, elegant red, blue, and yellow crowns of\nfeelers, and, while little fishes of marvellously gorgeous color dart\nabout in this fairy garden, in their midst luxuriantly grow delicate,\nfeathered plumulariae.",
        "[Ornamental but useless forts.] Bad weather and the flight of my\nservant, who had gambled away some money with which he had been\nentrusted, at a cock-fight, having detained me some days in the\nchief town, I proceeded up the bay, which extends southwards from\nCatbalogan and from west to east as far as Paranas. Its northern\nshore consists of ridges of earth, regular and of equal height,\nextending from north to south, with gentle slopes towards the west,\nbut steep declivities on the east, and terminating abruptly towards\nthe sea. Nine little villages are situated on this coast between\nCatbalogan and Paranas. From the hollows, amidst coco and betel\npalms, they expand in isolated groups of houses up the gentle western\nslopes, and, on reaching the summit, terminate in a little castle,\nwhich hardly affords protection against the pirates, but generally\nforms a pretty feature in the landscape. In front of the southern\nedge of the bay, and to the south-west, many small islands and wooded\nrocks are visible, with the mountains of Leyte in the high-ground,\nconstituting an ever-shifting series of views.",
        "[Paranas.] As the men, owing to the sultry heat, the complete calm,\nand almost cloudless sky, slept quite as much as they rowed, we\ndid not reach Paranas before the afternoon. It is a clean village,\nsituated on a declivity between twenty and a hundred and fifty feet\nabove the sea. The sides, which stand perpendicularly in the sea,\nconsist of grey banks of clay receding landwards, and overspread\nwith a layer of fragments of mussels, the intervals between which\nare filled up with clay, and over the latter is a solid breccia,\ncemented with lime, composed of similar fragments. In the clay banks\nare well-preserved petrifactions, so similar in color, habitat, and\naspect to many of those in the German tertiary formations that they\nmight be taken for them. The breccia also is fossil, probably also\ntertiary; at all events, the identity of the few species which were\nrecognisable in it–Cerithium, Pecten, and Venus–with living species\ncould not be determined. [170]",
        "[A canal through the bog.] On the following morning I proceeded\nnorthwards by a small canal, through a stinking bog of rhizophora\n(mangroves), and then continued my journey on land to Loquilocun,\na little village which is situated in the forest. Half-way we passed\nthrough a river, twenty feet broad, flowing east to west, with steep\nbanks rendered accessible by ladders.",
        "[Hammock-travelling.] As I still continued lame (wounds in the feet are\ndifficult to heal in warm countries), I caused myself to be carried\npart of the way in the manner which is customary hereabouts. The\ntraveller lies on a loose mat, which is fastened to a bamboo frame,\nborne on the shoulders of four robust polistas. About every ten\nminutes the bearers are relieved by others. As a protection against\nsun and rain, the frame is furnished with a light roof of pandanus.",
        "[Poor roads.] The roads were pretty nearly as bad as those at the\nSalta Sangley; and, with the exception of the sea-shore, which is\nsometimes available, there appear to be none better in Samar. After\nthree hours we reached the Loquilocun, which, coming from the north,\nhere touches its most southerly point, and then flows south-east to\nthe great ocean. Through the kind care of the governor, I found two\nsmall boats ready, which were propelled with wonderful dexterity by\ntwo men squatted at the extreme ends, and [Running the rapids.] glided\nbetween the branches of the trees and rocks into the bed of the rapid\nmountain torrent. Amidst loud cheers both the boats glided down a\ncascade of a foot and a half in height without shipping any water.",
        "[Loquilocun.] The little village of Loquilocun consists of three\ngroups of houses on three hillocks. The inhabitants were very friendly,\nmodest, and obliging, and so successful in collecting that the spirits\nof wine which I had with me was quickly consumed. In Catbalogan\nmy messengers were able with difficulty to procure a few small\nflasks. Through the awkward arrangements of a too obliging friend,\nmy own stores, having been sent to a wrong address, did not reach\nme until some months afterwards; and the palm-wine, which was to be\nbought in Samar, was too weak. One or two boats went out daily to fish\nfor me; but I obtained only a few specimens, which belonged to almost\nas many species and genera. Probably the bad custom of poisoning the\nwater in order to kill the fish (the pounded fruit of a Barringtonia\nhere being employed for the purpose) is the cause of the river being\nso empty of fish.",
        "[Numerous small streams.] After a few days we left the little place\nabout half-past nine in the forenoon, packed closely in two small\nboats; and, by seven minutes past one when we reached an inhabited\nhut in the forest, we had descended more than forty streams of a\nfoot and a foot and a half and more in depth. The more important of\nthem have names which are correctly given on Coello’s map; and the\nfollowing are their distances by the watch:–At ten o’clock we came\nto a narrow, rocky chasm, at the extremity of which the water falls\nseveral feet below into a large basin; and here we unloaded the boats,\nwhich hitherto had, under skilful management, wound their way, like\nwell-trained horses, between all the impediments in the bed of the\nriver and over all the cascades and waves, almost without taking any\nwater; only two men remaining in each boat, who, loudly cheering,\nshot downwards; in doing which the boats were filled to the brim.",
        "[Jasper and Coal.] Opposite this waterfall a bank of rubbish had been\nformed by the alluvium, in which, besides fragments of the subjacent\nrock, were found well-rounded pieces of jasper and porphyry, as well\nas some bits of coal containing several pyrites, which had probably\nbeen brought during the rain from higher up the river. Its origin was\nunknown to the sailors. From fifty-six minutes past eleven to twelve\no’clock there was an uninterrupted succession of rapids, which were\npassed with the greatest dexterity, without taking in water. Somewhat\nlower down, at about three minutes past twelve, we took in so much\nwater that we were compelled to land and bale it out. At about fifteen\nminutes past twelve, we proceeded onwards, the river now being on\nthe average sixty feet broad. On the edge of the wood some slender\npalms, hardly ten feet high, were remarkable by their frequency,\nand many phalaenopses by their display of blossoms, which is of\nrare occurrence. Neither birds nor apes, nor serpents were observed;\nbut large pythons, as thick as one’s leg are said to be not unfrequent.",
        "[Big pythons.] About thirty-six minutes past twelve we reached one\nof the most difficult places–a succession of waves, with many rocks\nprojecting out of the water, between which the boats, now in full\ncareer, and with rapid evolutions, glided successfully. The adventure\nwas accomplished with equal skill by the two crews, who exerted their\npowers to the utmost. At seventeen minutes past one we arrived at\n[Dini portage.] Dini, the most considerable waterfall in the whole\ndistance; and here we had to take the boats out of the water; and,\navailing ourselves of the lianas which hung down from the lofty forest\ntrees like ropes, we dragged them over the rocks. At twenty-one minutes\npast two we resumed our journey; and from twenty-two minutes past to\nhalf past eight we descended an irregular stair composed of several\nledges, shipping much water. Up to this point the Loquilocun flowed in\na rocky bed, with (for the most part) steep banks, and sometimes for\na long distance under a thick canopy of boughs, from which powerful\ntendrils and ferns, more than a fathom in length, were suspended. Here\nthe country was to some extent open; flat hillocks, with low underwood,\ncame to view, and, on the north-west, loftier wooded mountains. The\nlast two hours were notable for a heavy fall of rain, and, about half\npast five, we reached a solitary house occupied by friendly people,\nwhere we took up our quarters for the night.",
        "[Down the river.] On the following morning the journey was continued\ndown the river. Within ten minutes we glided past the last waterfall,\nbetween white calcareous rocks of a kind of marble, covered with\nmagnificent vegetation. Branches, completely covered with phalaenopses\n(P. Aphrodite, Reichb. fls.), projected over the river, their flowers\nwaving like large gorgeous butterflies over its foaming current. Two\nhours later the stream became two hundred feet broad, and, after\nleaping down a ladder of fifty meters in height from Loquilocun,\nit steals away in gentle windings through a flat inundated country\nto the east coast; forming a broad estuary, on the right bank of\nwhich, half a league from the sea, the district of Jubasan or Paric\n(population 2,300) is situated. The latter give their names to the\nlower portion of the stream. Here the excellent fellows of Loquilocun\nleft me in order to begin their very arduous return journey.",
        "[Along the coast.] Owing to bad weather, I could not embark for Tubig\n(population 2,858), south of Paric, before the following day; and,\nbeing continually hindered by difficulties of land transit, I proceeded\nin the rowboat along the coast to Borongan (population 7,685), with\nthe equally intelligent and obliging priest with whom I remained\nsome days, and then continued my journey to Guiuan (also Guiuang,\nGuiguan), the most important district in Samar (population 10,781),\nsituated on a small neck of land which projects from the south-east\npoint of the island into the sea.",
        "[A tideland spring.] Close to the shore at the latter place\na copious spring bursts out of five or six openings, smelling\nslightly of sulphuretted hydrogen. It is covered by the sea during\nthe flow, but is open during the ebb, when its salt taste is hardly\nperceptible. In order to test the water, a well was formed by sinking\na deep bottomless jar, and from this, after the water had flowed for\nthe space of half an hour, a sample was taken, which, to my regret,\nwas afterwards lost. The temperature of the water of the spring, at\neight o’clock in the forenoon, was 27.7°; of the atmosphere, 28.7°;\nof the sea-water, 31.2°C. The spring is used by the women to dye\ntheir sarongs. The materials, after being steeped in the decoction\nof a bark abounding in tannin (materials made of the abacá are first\nsoaked in a calcareous preparation), and dried in the sun, are placed\nin the spring during the ebb, taken out during the flow, re-dried,\ndipped in the decoction of bark, and again, while wet, placed in the\nspring; and this is repeated for the space of three days; when the\nresult is a durable, but ugly inky black (gallussaures, oxide of iron).",
        "[East Indian monkeys.] At Loquilocun and Borongan I had an opportunity\nof purchasing two live macaques. [171] These extremely delicate\nand rare little animals, which belong to the class of semi-apes,\nare, as I was assured in Luzon and Leyte, to be found only in\nSamar, and live exclusively on charcoal. My first “mago” was, in the\nbeginning, somewhat voracious, but he disdained vegetable food, and was\nparticular in his choice of insects, devouring live grasshoppers with\ndelight. [172] It was extremely ludicrous, when he was fed in the day\ntime, to see the animal standing, perched up perpendicularly on his two\nthin legs with his bare tail, and turning his large head–round as a\nball, and with very large, yellow, owl-like eyes–in every direction,\nlooking like a dark lantern on a pedestal with a circular swivel. Only\ngradually did he succeed in fixing his eyes on the object presented\nto him; but, as soon as he did perceive it, he immediately extended\nhis little arms sideways, as though somewhat bashful, and then, like\na delighted child, suddenly seizing it with hand and mouth at once,\nhe deliberately tore the prey to pieces. During the day the mago\nwas sleepy, short-sighted, and, when disturbed, morose; but with\nthe decreasing daylight he expanded his pupils, and moved about in\na lively and agile manner, with rapid noiseless leaps, generally\nsideways. He soon became tame, but to my regret died after a few\nweeks; and I succeeded only for a short time in keeping the second\nlittle animal alive.",
        "[Pearl divers from the Carolines.] In Guiuan I was visited by some\nMicronesians, who for the last fourteen days had been engaged at\nSulangan on the small neck of land south-east from Guiuan, in diving\nfor pearl mussels (mother-of-pearl), having undertaken the dangerous\njourney for the express purpose. [173]",
        "[Hardships and perils of their voyage.] They had sailed from Uleai\n(Uliai, 7° 20’ N., 143°57’ E. Gr.) in five boats, each of which had a\ncrew of nine men and carried forty gourds full of water, with coconuts\nand batata. Every man received one coconut daily, and two batatas,\nwhich they baked in the ashes of the coco shells; and they caught\nsome fish on the way, and collected a little rain-water. During\nthe day they directed their course by the sun, and at night by\nthe stars. A storm destroyed the boats. Two of them sank, together\nwith their crews, before the eyes of their companions, and of these,\nonly one–probably the sole individual rescued–two weeks afterwards\nreached the harbor of Tandag, on the east coast of Mindanao. The\nparty remained at Tandag two weeks, working in the fields for hire,\nand then proceeded northwards along the coast to Cantilang, 8° 25’ N.;\nBanouan (called erroneously Bancuan by Coello), 9° 1’ N.; Taganaan, 9°\n25’ N.; thence to Surigao, on the north point of Mindanao; and then,\nwith an easterly wind, in two days, direct to Guiuan. In the German\ntranslation of Captain Salmon’s “History of the Oriental Islands\"\n(Altona, 1733), it is stated that:",
        "[Castaways from the Pelews.] “Some other islands on the east of\nthe Philippines have lately been discovered which have received\nthe name of the New Philippines because they are situated in the\nneighborhood of the old, which have been already described. Father Clan\n(Clain), in a letter from Manila, which has been incorporated in the\n’Philosophical Transactions,’ makes the following statement respecting\nthem:–It happened that when he was in the town of Guivam, on the\nisland of Samar, he met twenty-nine Palaos (there had been thirty,\nbut one died soon after in Guiuan), or natives of certain recently\ndiscovered islands, who had been driven thither by the east winds,\nwhich prevail from December to May. According to their own statement,\nthey were driven about by the winds for seventy days, without getting\nsight of land, until they arrived opposite to Guivam. When they\nsailed from their own country, their two boats were quite full,\ncarrying thirty-five souls, including their wives and children;\nbut several had died miserably on the way from the fatigue which\nthey had undergone. When some one from Guivam wished to go on board\nto them, they were thrown into such a state of terror that all who\nwere in one of the boats sprang overboard, along with their wives\nand children. However, they at last thought it best to come into\nthe harbor; so they came ashore on December 28, 1696. They fed on\ncoconuts and roots, which were charitably supplied to them, but\nrefused even to taste cooked rice, which is the general food of the\nAsiatic nations. [Previous castaways.] Two women who had previously\nbeen cast away on the same islands acted as interpreters for them....",
        "[Lived by sea-fishing and rain water.] “The people of the country\nwent half naked, and the men painted their bodies with spots and\nall kinds of devices.... As long as they were on the sea they lived\non fish, which they caught in a certain kind of fish-basket, with a\nwide mouth but tapering to a point at the bottom, which was dragged\nalong underneath the boats; and rain-water, when they could catch it\n(or, as is stated in the letter itself, preserved in the shells of the\ncoconut), served them for drink. When they were about to be taken into\nthe presence of the Father, whom, from the great respect which was\nshown to him, they took for the governor, they colored their bodies\nentirely yellow, an operation which they considered highly important,\nas enabling them to appear as persons of consideration. They are very\nskilful divers, and now and then find pearls in the mussels which\nthey bring up, which, however, they throw away as useless things.”",
        "[Not the first time for one.] But one of the most important parts of\nFather Clain’s letter has been omitted by Capt. Salmon:–\"The oldest\nof these strangers had once before been cast away on the coast of\nthe province of Caragan, on one of our islands (Mindanao); but as he\nfound only heathens (infidels), who lived in the mountains or on the\ndesert shore, he returned to his own country.”",
        "[Yap camotes from Philippines.] In a letter from Father Cantova to\nFather d’Aubenton, dated from Agdana (i.e. Agaña, of the Marianne\nIslands), March 20, 1722, describing the Caroline and Pelew Islands,\nit is said:–\"The fourth district lies to the west. Yap (9° 25’ N.,\n138° 1’ E. Gr.), [174] which is the principal island, is more than\nforty leagues in circumference. Besides the different roots which\nare used by the natives of the island instead of bread, there is the\nbatata, which they call camote, and which they have acquired from\nthe Philippines, as I was informed by one of our Caroline Indians,\nwho is a native of the island. He states that his father, named\nCoorr, ... three of his brothers, and himself had been cast away in\na storm on one of the provinces in the Philippines, which was called\nBisayas; that a missionary of our society (Jesus) received them in a\nfriendly manner ... that on returning to their own island they took\nwith them the seeds of different plants, amongst others the [Other\narrivals of Micronesians.] batata, which multiplied so fast that they\nhad sufficient to supply the other islands of the Archipelago with\nthem.” Murillo Velarde states that in 1708 some Palaos were wrecked\nin a storm on Palapag (north coast of Samar); and I personally had\nthe opportunity, in Manila, of photographing a company of Palaos and\nCaroline islanders, who had been the year before cast on the coast of\nSamar by foul weather. Apart from the question of their transport,\nwhether voluntary or not, these simply were six examples, such\nas still occur occasionally, of Micronesians cast up on the shore\nof the Philippines; and probably it would not be difficult to find\nseveral more; but how often, both before and after the arrival of the\nSpaniards, might not vessels from those islands have come within the\ninfluence of the north-east storms, and been driven violently on the\neast coast of the Philippines without any record of such facts being\npreserved? [175] Even as, on the west side of the Archipelago, the\ntype of the race seems to have been modified by its long intercourse\nwith China, Japan, Lower India, and later with Europe, so likewise may\nPolynesian [Possible influence on Filipinos.] influences have operated\nin a similar manner on the east side; and the further circumstance\nthat the inhabitants of the Ladrones [176] and the Bisayans [177]\npossess the art of coloring their teeth black, seems to point to\nearly intercourse between the Bisayans and the Polynesians. [178]",
        "[A futile sea voyage in an open boat.] At Guiuan I embarked on board\nan inconveniently cranky, open boat, which was provided with an awning\nonly three feet square, for Tacloban, the chief town of Leyte. After\nfirst experiencing an uninterrupted calm, we incurred great danger\nin a sudden tempest, so that we had to retrace the whole distance\nby means of the oars. The passage was very laborious for the crew,\nwho were not protected by an awning (temperature in the sun 35° R.,\nof the water 25° R. [179]), and lasted thirty-one hours, with few\nintermissions; the party voluntarily abridging their intervals of rest\nin order to get back quickly to Tacloban, which keeps up an active\nintercourse with Manila, and has all the attractions of a luxurious\ncity for the men living on the inhospitable eastern coast. [Beauty\nof Samar-Leyte strait.]  It is questionable whether the sea anywhere\nwashes over a spot of such peculiar beauty as the narrow strait which\ndivides Samar from Leyte. On the west it is enclosed by steep banks\nof tuff, which tolerate no swamps of mangroves on their borders. There\nthe lofty primeval forest approaches in all its sublimity close to the\nshore, interrupted only here and there by groves of cocos, in whose\nsharply defined shadows solitary huts are to be found; and the steep\nhills facing the sea, and numerous small rocky islands, are crowned\nwith little castles of blocks of coral. At the eastern entrance of\nthe strait the south coast of Samar consists of white limestone,\nlike marble, but of quite modern date, which in many places forms\nprecipitous cliffs. [180] At Nipa-Nipa, a small hamlet two leagues from\nBasey, they project into the sea in a succession of picturesque rocks,\nabove one hundred feet in height, which, rounded above like a dome,\nthickly covered with vegetation, and corroded at the base by the waters\nof the sea, rise out of the waves like gigantic mushrooms. A peculiar\natmosphere of enchantment pervades this locality, whose influence upon\nthe native mariner must be all the more powerful when, fortunately\nescaping from the billows outside and the buffeting of the north-east\nwind, he suddenly enters this tranquil place of refuge. No wonder\nthat superstitious imagination has peopled the place with spirits.",
        "[Burial caves.] In the caverns of these rocks the ancient Pintados\ninterred the corpses of their heroes and ancestors in well-locked\ncoffins, surrounded by those objects which had been held in the highest\nregard by them during life. Slaves were also sacrificed by them at\ntheir obsequies, in order that they might not be without attendance\nin the world of shadows; [181] and the numerous coffins, implements,\narms, and trinkets, protected by superstitious terrors, continued to\nbe undisturbed for centuries. No boat ventured to cross over without\nthe observance of a religious ceremony, derived from heathen times,\nto propitiate the spirits of the caverns who were believed to punish\nthe omission of it with storm and ship-wreck.",
        "[Objects destroyed but superstition persists.] About thirty years ago\na zealous young ecclesiastic, to whom these heathen practices were an\nabomination, determined to extirpate them by the roots. With several\nboats well equipped with crosses, banners, pictures of saints, and\nall the approved machinery for driving out the Devil, he undertook\nthe expedition against the haunted rocks, which were climbed amidst\nthe sounds of music, prayers, and the reports of fireworks. A whole\npailful of holy water first having been thrown into the cave for the\npurpose of confounding the evil spirits, the intrepid priest rushed\nin with elevated cross, and was followed by his faithful companions,\nwho were fired with his example. A brilliant victory was the reward\nof the well-contrived and carefully executed plot. The coffins were\nbroken to fragments, the vessels dashed to pieces, and the skeletons\nthrown into the sea; and the remaining caverns were stormed with like\nresults. The objects of superstition have indeed been annihilated,\nbut the superstition itself survives to the present day.",
        "[Skulls from a rock near Basey.] I subsequently learned from the\npriest at Basey that there were still some remains on a rock, and\na few days afterwards the worthy man surprised me with several\nskulls and a child’s coffin, which he had had brought from the\nplace. Notwithstanding the great respect in which he was held by his\nflock, he had to exert all his powers of persuasion to induce the\nboldest of them to engage in so daring an enterprise. A boat manned\nby sixteen rowers was fitted out for the purpose; with a smaller crew\nthey would not have ventured to undertake the journey. On their return\nhome a thunderstorm broke over them, and the sailors, believing it to\nbe a punishment for their outrage, were prevented only by the fear\nof making the matter worse from throwing coffin and skulls into the\nsea. Fortunately the land was near, and they rowed with all their\nmight towards it; and, when they arrived, I was obliged to take the\nobjects out of the boat myself, as no native would touch them.",
        "[The cavern’s contents.] Notwithstanding, I was the next morning\nsuccessful in finding some resolute individuals who accompanied\nme to the caverns. In the first two which we examined we found\nnothing; the third contained several broken coffins, some skulls,\nand potsherds of glazed and crudely painted earthenware, of which,\nhowever, it was impossible to find two pieces that belonged to each\nother. A narrow hole led from the large cavern into an obscure space,\nwhich was so small that one could remain in it only for a few seconds\nwith the burning torch. This circumstance may explain the discovery,\nin a coffin which was eaten to pieces by worms, and quite mouldered\naway, of a well-preserved skeleton, or rather a mummy, for in many\nplaces there were carcasses clothed with dry fibers of muscle and\nskin. It lay upon a mat of pandanus, which was yet recognizable, with\na cushion under the head stuffed with plants, and covered with matting\nof pandanus. There were no other remains of woven material. The coffins\nwere of three shapes and without any ornament. Those of the first form,\nwhich were of excellent molave-wood, showed no trace of worm-holes or\ndecay, whereas the others had entirely fallen to dust; and those of\nthe third kind, which were most numerous, were distinguishable from\nthe first only by a less curved form and inferior material.",
        "[Impressive location of burial cave.] No legend could have supplied\nan enchanted royal sepulchre with a more suitable approach than that\nof the last of these caverns. The rock rises out of the sea with\nperpendicular sides of marble, and only in one spot is to be observed\na natural opening made by the water, hardly two feet high, through\nwhich the boat passed at once into a spacious court, almost circular,\nand over-arched by the sky, the floor of which was covered by the sea,\nand adorned with a garden of corals. The steep sides are thickly hung\nwith lianas, ferns, and orchids, by help of which one climbs upwards\nto the cavern, sixty feet above the surface of the water. To add to\nthe singularity of the situation, we also found at the entrance to\nthe grotto, on a large block of rock projecting two feet above the\nground, [A sea snake.] a sea-snake, which tranquilly gazed at us,\nbut which had to be killed, because, like all genuine sea-snakes,\nit was poisonous. Twice before I had found the same species in\ncrevices of rock on the dry land, where the ebb might have left it;\nbut it was strange to meet with it in this place, at such a height\nabove the sea. It now reposes, as Platurus fasciatus Daud., in the\nZoological Museum of the Berlin University.",
        "[Chinese dishers from a cave.] In Guiuan I had an opportunity of\npurchasing four richly painted Chinese dishes which came from a\nsimilar cavern, and a gold signet ring; the latter consisting of a\nplate of gold, originally bent into a tube of the thickness of a quill\nwith a gaping seam, and afterwards into a ring as large as a thaler,\nwhich did not quite meet. The dishes were stolen from me at Manila.",
        "[Burial caves.] There are similar caverns which have been used\nas burial-places in many other localities in this country; on the\nisland of Andog, in Borongan (a short time ago it contained skulls);\nalso at Batinguitan, three hours from Borongan, on the banks of a\nlittle brook; and in Guiuan, on the little island of Monhon, which is\ndifficult of approach by reason of the boisterous sea. In Catubig\ntrinkets of gold have been found, but they have been converted\ninto modern articles of adornment. One cavern at Lauang, however,\nis famous over the whole country on account of the gigantic, flat,\ncompressed skulls, without sutures, which have been found in it.\n[182] It will not be uninteresting to compare the particulars here\ndescribed with the statements of older authors; and for this reason\nI submit the following extracts:–",
        "[Embalming.] Mas (Informe, i. 21), who does not give the sources of\nhis information, thus describes the customs of the ancient inhabitants\nof the archipelago at their interments:–They sometimes embalmed\ntheir dead with aromatic substances * * * and placed those who were\nof note in chests carved out of a branch of a tree, and furnished\nwith well-fitted lids * * * The coffin was placed, in accordance with\nthe wish of the deceased, expressed before his death, either in the\nuppermost room of the house, where articles of value were secreted,\nor under the dwelling-house, in a kind of grave, which was not\ncovered, but enclosed with a railing; or in a distant field, or on\nan elevated place or rock on the bank of a river, where he might be\nvenerated by the pious. A watch was set over it for a certain time,\nlest boats should cross over, and the dead person should drag the\nliving after him.",
        "[Burial customs.] According to Gaspar San Agustín (p. 169), the\ndead were rolled up in cloths, and placed in clumsy chests, carved\nout of a block of wood, and buried under their houses, together with\ntheir jewels, gold rings, and some plates of gold over the mouth and\neyes, and furnished with provisions, cups, and dishes. They were also\naccustomed to bury slaves along with men of note, in order that they\nmight be attended in the other world.",
        "“Their chief idolatry consisted in the worship of those of their\nancestors who had most distinguished themselves by courage and genius,\nwhom they regarded as deities * * * * They called them humalagar,\nwhich is the same as manes in the Latin * * * Even the aged died under\nthis conceit, choosing particular places, such as one on the island of\nLeyte, which allowed of their being interred at the edge of the sea,\nin order that the mariners who crossed over might acknowledge them\nas deities, and pay them respect.” (Thévenot, Religieux, p. 2.)",
        "[Slaves sacrificed.] “They did not place them (the dead) in the earth,\nbut in coffins of very hard, indestructible wood * * * Male and female\nslaves were sacrificed to them, that they should not be unattended\nin the other world. If a person of consideration died, silence was\nimposed upon the whole of the people, and its duration was regulated\nby the rank of the deceased; and under certain circumstances it was\nnot discontinued until his relations had killed many other persons\nto appease the spirit of the dead.” (Ibid., p. 7.)",
        "“For this reason (to be worshipped as deities) the oldest of them\nchose some remarkable spot in the mountains, and particularly on\nheadlands projecting into the sea, in order to be worshipped by the\nsailors.” (Gemelli Careri, p. 449.)",
        "[Basey and its river.] From Tacloban, which I chose for my headquarters\non account of its convenient tribunal, and because it is well supplied\nwith provisions, I returned on the following day to Samar, and then\nto Basey, which is opposite to Tacloban. The people of Basey are\nnotorious over all Samar for their laziness and their stupidity, but\nare advantageously distinguished from the inhabitants of Tacloban by\ntheir purity of manners. Basey is situated on the delta of the river,\nwhich is named after it. We proceeded up a small arm of the principal\nstream, which winds, with a very slight fall, through the plain;\nthe brackish water, and the fringe of nipa-palms which accompanies\nit, consequently extending several leagues into the country. Coco\nplantations stretch behind them; and there the floods of water\n(avenidas), which sometimes take place in consequence of the narrow\nrocky bed of the upper part of the river, cause great devastation,\nas was evident from the mutilated palms which, torn away from their\nstanding-place, rise up out of the middle of the river. After five\nhours’ rowing we passed out of the flat country into a narrow valley,\nwith steep sides of marble, which progressively closed in and became\nhigher. In several places they are underwashed, cleft, and hurled over\neach other, and with their naked side-walls form a beautiful contrast\nto the blue sky, the clear, greenish river, and the luxuriant lianas,\nwhich, attaching themselves to every inequality to which they could\ncling, hung in long garlands over the rocks.",
        "[A frontage.] The stream became so rapid and so shallow that the party\ndisembarked and dragged the boat over the stony bed. In this manner\nwe passed through a sharp curve, twelve feet in height, formed by two\nrocks thrown opposite to each other, into a tranquil oval-shaped basin\nof water enclosed in a circle of limestone walls, inclining inwards,\nof from sixty to seventy feet in height; on the upper edge of which a\ncircle of trees permitted only a misty sunlight to glimmer through the\nthick foliage. A magnificent gateway of rock, fifty to sixty feet high,\nand adorned with numerous stalactites, raised itself up opposite the\nlow entrance; and through it we could see, at some distance, the upper\nportion of the river bathed in the sun. [A beautiful grotto.] A cavern\nof a hundred feet in length, and easily climbed, opened itself in the\nleft side of the oval court, some sixty feet above the surface of the\nwater; and it ended in a small gateway, through which you stepped on\nto a projection like a balcony, studded with stalactites. From this\npoint both the landscape and the rocky cauldron are visible, and\nthe latter is seen to be the remainder of a stalactitic cavern, the\nroof of which has fallen in. The beauty and peculiar character of the\nplace have been felt even by the natives, who have called it Sogoton\n(properly, a bay in the sea). In the very hard limestone, which is\nlike marble, I observed traces of bivalves and multitudes of spines of\nthe sea-urchin, but no well-defined remains could be knocked off. The\nriver could still be followed a short distance further upwards; and in\nits bed there were disjointed fragments of talcose and chloritic rocks.",
        "[Fishing.] A few small fishes were obtained with much difficulty;\nand amongst them was a new and interesting species, viviparous. [183]\nAn allied species (H. fluviatilis, Bleeker) which I had two years\npreviously found in a limestone cavern on Nusa Kambangan, in Java,\nlikewise contained living young ones. The net employed in fishing\nappears to be suited to the locality, which is a shallow river, full of\ntransparent blocks. It is a fine-meshed, longish, four-cornered net,\nhaving its ample sides fastened to two poles of bamboo, which at the\nbottom were provided with a kind of wooden shoes, which curve upwards\ntowards the stems when pushed forwards. The fisherman, taking hold of\nthe upper ends of the poles, pushes the net, which is held obliquely\nbefore him, and the wooden shoes cause it to slide over the stones,\nwhile another person drives the fish towards him.",
        "[Fossil beds.] On the right bank, below the cavern, and twenty\nfeet above the surface of the water, there are beds of fossils,\npectunculus, tapes, and placuna, some of which, from the fact of\ntheir barely adhering by the tip, must be of very recent date. I\npassed the night in a small hut, which was quickly erected for me,\nand on the following day attempted to pass up the river as far as the\nlimits of the crystalline rock, but in vain. In the afternoon we set\nout on our return to Basey, which we reached at night.",
        "[Recent elevation of coast.] Basey is situated on a bank of clay,\nabout fifty feet above the sea, which towards the west elevates itself\ninto a hill several hundred feet in height, and with steep sides. At\ntwenty-five to thirty feet above the sea I found the same recent beds\nof mussels as in the stalactitic cavern of Sogoton. From the statements\nof the parish priest and of other persons, a rapid elevation of the\ncoasts seems to be taking place in this country. Thirty years ago\nships could lie alongside the land in three fathoms of water at the\nflood, whereas the depth at the same place now is not much more than\none fathom. Immediately opposite to Basey lie two small islands,\nGenamok and Tapontonan, which, at the present time, appear to be\nsurrounded by a sandbank at the lowest ebb-tide. Twenty years ago\nnothing of the kind was to be seen. Supposing these particulars to\nbe correct, we must next ascertain what proportion of these changes\nof level is due to the floods, and how much to volcanic elevation;\nwhich, if we may judge by the neighboring active solfatara at Leyte,\nmust always be of considerable amount.",
        "[Crocodiles.] As the priest assured us, there are crocodiles in the\nriver Basey over thirty feet in length, those in excess of twenty\nfeet being numerous. The obliging father promised me one of at least\ntwenty-four feet, whose skeleton I would gladly have secured; and he\nsent out some men who are so practised in the capture of these animals\nthat they are dispatched to distant places for the purpose. Their\ncontrivance for capturing them, which I, however, never personally\nwitnessed, consists of a light raft of bamboo, with a stage, on which,\nseveral feet above the water, a dog or a cat is bound. Alongside\nthe animal is placed a strong iron hook, which is fastened to the\nswimming bamboo by means of fibers of abacá. The crocodile, when\nit has swallowed the bait and the hook at the same time, endeavors\nin vain to get away, for the pliability of the raft prevents its\nbeing torn to pieces, and the peculiar elasticity of the bundle of\nfibers prevents its being bitten through. The raft serves likewise\nas a buoy for the captured animal. According to the statements of\nthe hunters, the large crocodiles live far from human habitations,\ngenerally selecting the close vegetation in an oozy swamp, in which\ntheir bellies, dragging heavily along, leave trails behind them which\nbetray them to the initiated. After a week the priest mentioned that\nhis party had sent in three crocodiles, the largest of which, however,\nmeasured only eighteen feet, but that he had not kept one for me,\nas he hoped to obtain one of thirty feet. His expectation, however,\nwas not fulfilled.",
        "[Ignatius bean.] In the environs of Basey the Ignatius bean grows\nin remarkable abundance, as it also does in the south of Samar and\nin some other of the Bisayan islands. It is not met with in Luzon,\nbut it is very likely that I have introduced it there unwittingly. Its\nsphere of propagation is very limited; and my attempts to transplant\nit to the Botanical Garden of Buitenzorg were fruitless. Some large\nplants intended for that purpose, which during my absence arrived\nfor me at Daraga, were incorporated by one of my patrons into his\nown garden; and some, which were collected by himself and brought\nto Manila, were afterwards lost. Every effort to get these seeds\n(kernels), which are used over the whole of Eastern Asia as medicine,\nto germinate miscarried, they having been boiled before transmission,\nostensibly for their preservation, but most probably to secure the\nmonopoly of them.",
        "[Strychnine.] According to Flueckinger, [184] the gourd-shaped\nberry of the climbing shrub (Ignatia amara, L. Strychnos Ignatii,\nBerg. Ignatiana Philippinica. Lour.) contains twenty-four irregular\negg-shaped seeds of the size of an inch which, however, are not so\npoisonous as the Ignatius beans, which taste like crack-nuts. In\nthese seeds strychnine was found by Pelletier and Caventou in 1818,\nas it subsequently was in crack-nuts. The former contained twice as\nmuch of it as the latter, viz. one and a half per cent; but, as they\nare four times as dear, it is only produced from the latter.",
        "[Cholera and snake-bite cure.] In many households in the Philippines\nthe dangerous drug is to be found as a highly prized remedy, under the\nname of Pepita de Catbalonga. Gemelli Careri mentions it, and quotes\nthirteen different uses of it. Dr. Rosenthal (\"Synopsis Plantarum\nDiaphor.” p. 363) says:–\"In India it has been employed as a remedy\nagainst cholera under the name of Papecta.” Papecta is probably a\nclerical error. In K. Lall Dey’s “Indigenous Drugs of India,” it is\ncalled Papeeta, which is pronounced Pepita in English; and Pepita is\nthe Spanish word for the kernel of a fruit. It is also held in high\nestimation as an antidote for the bite of serpents. Father Blanco\n(\"Flora of the Philippines,” 61), states that he has more than once\nproved its efficacy in this respect in his own person; but he cautions\nagainst its employment internally, as it had been fatal in very many\ncases. It should not be taken into the mouth, for should the spittle\nbe swallowed, and vomiting not ensue, death would be inevitable. The\nparish priest of Tabaco, however, almost always carried a pepita in\nhis mouth. From 1842 he began occasionally to take an Ignatius bean\ninto his mouth as a protection against cholera, and so gradually\naccustomed himself to it. When I met him in 1860 he was quite well,\nand ascribed his health and vigor expressly to that habit. According to\nhis communication, in cases of cholera the decoction was successfully\nadministered in small doses introduced into tea; but it was most\nefficacious when, mixed with brandy, it was applied as a liniment.",
        "[Superstitions regarding the “Bisayan” bean.] Huc also (\"Thibet,\"\nI. 252) commends the expressed juice of the kouo-kouo (Faba\nIgn. amar.) both for internal and external use, and remarks that it\nplays a great part in Chinese medicine, no apothecary’s shop being\nwithout it. Formerly the poisonous drug was considered a charm, as\nit is still by many. Father Camel [185] states that the Catbalogan\nor Bisayan-bean, which the Indians call Igasur or Mananaog (the\nvictorious), was generally worn as an amulet round the neck, being\na preservative against poison, contagion, magic, and philtres, so\npotent, indeed, that the Devil in propia persona could not harm the\nwearer. Especially efficacious is it against a poison communicated by\nbreathing upon one, for not only does it protect the wearer, but it\nkills the individual who wishes to poison him. Camel further mentions\na series of miracles which superstition ascribed to the Ignatius bean.",
        "[Coconuts.] On the southern half of the eastern border, on the shore\nfrom Borongan by Lauang as far as Guiuan, there are considerable\nplantations of cocos, which are most imperfectly applied to the\nproduction of oil. From Borongan and its visitas twelve thousand\npitchers of coconut oil are yearly exported to Manila, and the nuts\nconsumed by men and pigs would suffice for at least eight thousand\npitchers. As a thousand nuts yield eight pitchers and a half, the\nvicinity of Borongan alone yields annually six million nuts; for\nwhich, assuming the average produce at fifty nuts, one hundred-twenty\nthousand fullbearing palms are required. The statement that their\nnumber in the above-mentioned district amounts to several millions\nmust be an exaggeration.",
        "[Getting coco oil.] The oil is obtained in a very rude manner. The\nkernel is rasped out of the woody shell of the nut on rough boards,\nand left to rot; and a few boats in a state of decay, elevated on posts\nin the open air, serve as reservoirs, the oil dropping through their\ncrevices into pitchers placed underneath; and finally the boards are\nsubjected to pressure. This operation, which requires several months\nfor its completion, yields such a bad, dark-brown, and viscid product\nthat the pitcher fetches only two dollars and a quarter in Manila,\nwhile a superior oil costs six dollars. [186]",
        "[Oil factory.] Recently a young Spaniard has erected a factory\nin Borongan for the better preparation of oil. A winch, turned by\ntwo carabaos, sets a number of rasps in motion by means of toothed\nwheels and leather straps. They are somewhat like a gimlet in form,\nand consist of five iron plates, with dentated edges, which are\nplaced radiating on the end of an iron rod, and close together,\nforming a blunt point towards the front. The other end of the rod\npasses through the center of a disk, which communicates the rotary\nmotion to it, and projects beyond it. The workman, taking a divided\ncoconut in his two hands, holds its interior arch, which contains the\noil-bearing nut, with a firm pressure against the revolving rasp, at\nthe same time urging with his breast, which is protected by a padded\nboard, against the projecting end of the rod. The fine shreds of the\nnut remain for twelve hours in flat pans, in order that they may be\npartially decomposed. They are then lightly pressed in hand-presses;\nand the liquor, which consists of one-third oil and two-thirds water,\nis caught in tubs, from which, at the end of six hours, the oil,\nfloating on the surface, is skimmed off. It is then heated in iron\npans, containing 100 liters, until the whole of the water in it has\nevaporated, which takes from two to three hours. In order that the\noil may cool rapidly, and not become dark in color, two pailfuls of\ncold oil, freed from water, are poured into it, and the fire quickly\nremoved to a distance. The compressed shreds are once more exposed\nto the atmosphere, and then subjected to a powerful pressure. After\nthese two operations have been twice repeated, the rasped substance\nis suspended in sacks between two strong vertical boards and crushed\nto the utmost by means of clamp screws, and repeatedly shaken up. The\nrefuse serves as food for pigs. The oil which runs from the sacks is\nfree from water, and is consequently very clear, and is employed in\nthe cooling of that which is obtained in the first instance. [187]",
        "[Limited output.] The factory produces fifteen hundred tinajas of\noil. It is in operation only nine months in the year; from December to\nFebruary the transport of nuts being prevented by the tempestuous seas,\nthere being no land communication. The manufacturer was not successful\nin procuring nuts from the immediate vicinity in sufficient quantity\nto enable him to carry on his operations without interruption, nor,\nduring the favorable season of the year, could he lay up a store for\nthe winter months, although he paid the comparatively high price of\nthree dollars per thousand.",
        "[Illogical business.] While the natives manufactured oil in the manner\njust described, they obtained from a thousand nuts three and a half\npots, which, at six reals each, fetched twenty-one reals; that is three\nreals less than was offered them for the raw nuts. These data, which\nare obtained from the manufacturers, are probably exaggerated, but\nthey are in the main well founded; and the traveller in the Philippines\noften has the opportunity of observing similar anomalies. For example,\nin Daet, North Camarines, I bought six coconuts for one cuarto, at\nthe rate of nine hundred and sixty for one dollar, the common price\nthere. On my asking why no oil-factory had been erected, I received\nfor answer that the nuts were cheaper singly than in quantities. In\nthe first place, the native sells only when he wants money; but he\nknows that the manufacturer cannot well afford to have his business\nsuspended; so, careless of the result, he makes a temporary profit,\nand never thinks of ensuring for himself a permanent source of income.",
        "[Sugar venders.] In the province of Laguna, where the natives prepare\ncoarse brown sugar from sugar-cane, the women carry it for leagues to\nthe market, or expose it for sale on the country roads, in small loaves\n(panoche), generally along with buyo. Every passenger chats with the\nseller, weighs the loaf in the hand, eats a bit, and probably passes\non without buying any. In the evening the woman returns to her home\nwith her wares, and the next day repeats the same process.",
        "[Disproportionate prices.] I have lost my special notes, but I\nremember that in two cases at least the price of the sugar in these\nloaves was cheaper than by the picul. Moreover, the Government of the\nday anticipated the people in setting the example, by selling cigars\ncheaper singly than in quantities.",
        "[Uncertain trading.] In Europe a speculator generally can calculate\nbeforehand, with the greatest certainty, the cost of production of any\narticle; but in the Philippines it is not always so easy. Independently\nof the uncertainty of labor, the regularity of the supply of raw\nmaterial is disturbed, not only by laziness and caprice, but also\nby jealousy and distrust. The natives, as a rule, do not willingly\nsee Europeans settle amongst them and engage successfully in local\noperations which they themselves do not understand how to execute; and\nin like manner the creoles are reserved with foreigners, who generally\nare superior to them in capital, skill, and activity. Besides jealousy,\nsuspicion also plays a great part, and this influences the native\nas well against the mestizo as against the Castilian. Enough takes\nplace to the present day to justify this feeling; but formerly, when\nthe most thrifty subjects could buy governorships, and shamelessly\nfleece their provinces, such outrageous abuses are said to have been\npermitted until, in process of time, suspicion has become a kind of\ninstinct amongst the Filipinos.",
        "[Leyte.] The island of Leyte, between 9° 49’ and 11° 34’ N., and\n124° 7’ and 125° 9’ E. Gr., is above twenty-five miles in length,\nand almost twelve miles broad, and contains one hundred seventy\nsquare miles. As I have already remarked, it is divided from Samar\nonly by the small strait of San Juanico. The chief town, Tacloban or\nTaclobang, lies at the eastern entrance of this strait, with a very\ngood harbor and uninterrupted communication with Manila, and has\nconsequently become the chief emporium of trade to Leyte, Biliran,\nand South and East Samar. [188]",
        "[Obliging Spanish officials.] The local governor likewise showed me\nmuch obliging attention; indeed, almost without exception I have,\nsince my return, retained the most agreeable remembrances of the\nSpanish officials; and, therefore, if fitting opportunity occurred,\nI could treat of the improprieties of the Administration with greater\nimpartiality.",
        "[Locusts.] In the afternoon of the day after my arrival at Tacloban, on\na sudden there came a sound like the rush of a furious torrent; the air\nbecame dark, and a large cloud of locusts swept over the place. [189]\nI will not again recount that phenomenon, which has been so often\ndescribed, and is essentially the same in all quarters of the globe,\nbut will simply remark that the swarm, which was more than five hundred\nfeet in width, and about fifty feet in depth, its extremity being\nlost in the forest, was not thought a very considerable one. It caused\nvigilance, but not consternation. Old and young eagerly endeavored to\ncatch as many of the delicate creatures as they could, with cloths,\nnets, and flags, in order, as Dampier relates, “to roast them in\nan earthen pan over fire until their legs and wings drop off, and\ntheir heads and backs assume the color of boiled crabs;” after which\nprocess he says they had a pleasant taste. In Burma at the present day,\nthey are considered as delicacies at the royal court. [190]",
        "[Plan for their extermination.] The locusts are one of the greatest\nplagues of the Philippines, and sometimes destroy the harvest of entire\nprovinces. The Legislación Ultramarina (iv. 504) contains a special\nedict respecting the extirpation of these devastating pests. As soon\nas they appear, the population of the invaded localities are to be\ndrawn out in the greatest possible numbers, under the conduct of the\nauthorities, in order to effect their destruction. The most approved\nmeans for the attainment of this object are set forth in an official\ndocument referring to the adoption of extraordinary measures in cases\nof public emergency; and in this the locusts are placed midway between\nsea-pirates and conflagrations. Of the various means that have been\ncontrived against the destructive creatures, that, at times, appear\nin incredible numbers, but have been as frequently ineffectual as\notherwise, only a few will be now mentioned. On April 27, 1824,\nthe Sociedad Economica determined to import the bird, the martin\n(Gracula sp.), “which feeds by instinct on locusts.” In the autumn\nof the following year the first consignment arrived from China; in\n1829 a second; and in 1852 again occurs the item of $1,311 for martins.",
        "[Tacloban to Tanauan.] On the following day I proceeded with the\npriest of Dagami (there are roads in Leyte) from Tacloban southwards\nto Palos and Tanauan, two flourishing places on the east coast. Hardly\nhalf a league from the latter place, and close to the sea, a cliff\nof crystal lime rock rises up out of the sandy plain, which was level\nup to this point. It is of a greyish-green quartzose chlorite schist,\nfrom which the enterprising Father had endeavored, with a perseverance\nworthy of better success, to procure lime by burning. After an ample\nbreakfast in the convent, we proceeded in the afternoon to Dagami,\nand, on the next day, to Burauen. [191]",
        "[A pleasing people.] The country was still flat. Coco-groves and\nrice-fields here and there interrupted the thick forest; but the\ncountry is thinly inhabited, and the people appear more cheerful,\nhandsomer, and cleaner than those of Samar. South of Burauen rises\nthe mountain ridge of Manacagan, on the further slope of which is a\nlarge solfatara, which yields sulphur for the powder manufactory in\nManila, and for commerce. A Spanish sailor accompanied me. Where the\nroad passed through swamp we rode on carabaos. The pace of the animals\nis not unpleasant, but the stretching across the broad backs of the\ngigantic carabaos of the Philippines is very fatiguing. A quarter of an\nhour beyond Burauen we crossed the Daguitan, which flows south-west to\nnorth-east, and is a hundred feet broad, its bed being full of large\nvolcanic blocks; and, soon after, a small river in a broad bed; and,\nsome hundred paces farther, one of a hundred and fifty feet in breadth;\nthe two latter being arms of the Burauen. They flow from west to east,\nand enter the sea at Dulag. The second arm was originated only the\npreceding year, during a flood.",
        "[The height of hospitality.] We passed the night in a hut on\nthe northern slope of the Manacagan, which the owner, on seeing\nus approach, had voluntarily quitted, and with his wife and child\nsought other lodgings. The customs of the country require this when\nthe accommodation does not suffice for both parties; and payment for\nthe same is neither demanded nor, except very rarely, tendered.",
        "[Up the Manacagan.] About six o’clock on the following morning we\nstarted; and about half-past six climbed, by a pleasant path through\nthe forest, to the ridge of the Manacagan, which consists of trachytic\nhornblende; and about seven o’clock we crossed two small rivers flowing\nnorth-west, and then, by a curve, reached the coast at Dulag. From the\nridge we caught sight, towards the south, of the great white heaps\nof débris of the mountain Danan glimmering through the trees. About\nnine o’clock we came through the thickly-wooded crater of the Kasiboi,\nand, further south, to some sheds in which the sulphur is smelted.",
        "[Sulphur.] The raw material obtained from the solfatara is bought in\nthree classes: firstly, sulphur already melted to crusts; secondly,\nsublimated, which contains much condensed water in its interstices;\nand thirdly, in the clay, which is divided into the more or less\nrich, from which the greatest quantity is obtained. Coconut oil,\nwhich is thrown into flat iron pans holding six arrobas, is added to\nthe sulphurous clay, in the proportion of six quarts to four arrobas,\nand it is melted and continually stirred. The clay which floats on\nthe surface, now freed from the sulphur, being skimmed off, fresh\nsulphurous clay is thrown into the cauldron, and so on. In two or\nthree hours six arrobas of sulphur, on an average, may be obtained\nin this manner from twenty-four arrobas of sulphurous clay, and,\npoured into wooden chests, it is moulded into blocks of about four\narrobas. Half the oil employed is recovered by throwing the clay\nwhich has been saturated with it into a frame formed by two narrow\nbamboo hurdles, placed at a sharp angle. The oil drops into a sloping\ngutter of bamboo which is placed underneath, and from that flows into a\npot. The price of the sulphur at Manila varies between [Prices.] $1.25\nand $4.50 per picul. I saw the frames, full of clay, from which the\noil exuded; but the operation itself I did not, unfortunately, then\nwitness, and I cannot explain in what manner the oil is added. From\nsome experiments made on a small scale, therefore under essentially\ndifferent conditions, and never with the same material, it appeared\nthat the oil accelerates the separation of the sulphur, and retards\nthe access of the air to the sulphur. In these experiments, the sulphur\ncontained in the bottom of the crucible was always colored black by the\nseparation of charcoal from the oil, and it was necessary to purify it\nby distillation beforehand. Of this, however, the smelters at Leyte\nmade no mention, and they even had no apparatus for the purpose,\nwhile their sulphur was of a pure yellow color.",
        "[Hot spring.] Some hundreds of paces further south, a hot spring\n(50° R.), [192] twelve feet broad, flows from the east, depositing\nsilicious sinter at its edges.",
        "[A solfatara.] As we followed a ravine stretching from north to south,\nwith sides one hundred to two hundred feet in height, the vegetation\ngradually ceased, the rock being of a dazzling white, or colored by\nsublimated sulphur. In numerous places thick clouds of vapor burst from\nthe ground, with a strong smell of sulphurated water. At some thousand\npaces further, the ravine bends round to the left (east), and expands\nitself to the bay; and here numerous silicious springs break through\nthe loose clay-earth, which is permeated with sulphur. This solfatara\nmust formerly have been much more active than it is now. The ravine,\nwhich has been formed by its destruction of the rock, and is full\nof lofty heaps of débris, may be one thousand feet in breadth, and\nquite five times as long. At the east end there are a number of small,\nboiling quagmires, which, on forcing a stick into the matted ground,\nsend forth water and steam. In some deep spots further west, grey,\nwhite, red, and yellow clays have been deposited in small beds over\neach other, giving them the appearance of variegated marls.",
        "[Petrifying water] To the south, right opposite to the ridge which\nleads to Burauen, may be seen a basin twenty-five feet broad, in a\ncavern in the white decomposed rock, from which a petrifying water\ncontaining silicious acid flows abundantly. The roof of the cavern is\nhung with stalactites, which either are covered with solid sulphur,\nor consist entirely of that substance.",
        "[Danan solfatara.] On the upper slope of the Danan mountain, near\nto the summit, so much sulphur is deposited by the vapors from the\nsulphurated water that it may be collected with coconut shells. In\nsome crevices, which are protected against the cooling effects of\nthe atmospheric air, it melts together in thick, brown crusts. The\nsolfatara of Danan is situated exactly south of that below, at\nthe end of the ravine of the Kasiboi. The clay earth, from which\nthe silicic acid has been washed out by the rains, is carried into\nthe valley, where it forms a plain, the greater part of which is\noccupied by a small lake, Malaksan (sour), slightly impregnated with\nsulphuric acid. Its surface, which, by reason of the very flat banks,\nis protected against the weather, I found to be about five hundred\npaces long and one hundred broad. From the elevation of the solfatara,\na rather large fresh-water lake, surrounded by wooded mountains, is\nseen through a gap, exactly south, which is named Jaruanan. The night\nwas passed in a ruined shed at the south-east of the lake Malaksan;\nand on the following morning we climbed the south side of the mountain\nridge and, skirting the solfatara of the Danan, arrived in an hour\nand a half at lake Jaruanan.",
        "[Jaruanan Lake.] This lake, as well as the Malaksan, inspires\nthe natives with superstitious fear on account of the suspicious\nneighborhood of the solfatara, and therefore has not been profaned by\neither mariner, fisher, or swimmer, and was very full of fish. For the\npurpose of measuring its depth, I had a raft of bamboos constructed;\nand when my companions saw me floating safely on the lake, they\nall, without exception, sprang into it, and tumbled about in the\nwater with infinite delight and loud outcries, as if they wished\nto indemnify themselves for their long abstinence; so that the raft\nwas not ready before three o’clock. The soundings at the centre of\nthe basin, which was, at the southern edge, steeper than on the\nnorth, gave thirteen brazas, or over twenty-one meters of depth;\nthe greatest length of the lake amounted to nearly eight hundred\nvaras (six hundred and sixty-eight meters), and the breadth to about\nhalf as much. As we returned in the evening, by torchlight, over the\ncrest of the mountain to our night-quarters at the lake, we passed\nby the very modest dwelling-place of a married pair. Three branches,\nprojecting outwards from the principal trunk of a tree, and lopped at\nequal points, sustained a hut of bamboos and palm-leaves of eight feet\nsquare. A hole in the floor formed the entrance, and it was divided\ninto a chamber and ante-chamber, and four bamboo poles supported,\nabove and below, two layers of bamboos, one of which furnished a\nbalcony, and the other a shop in which betel was sold.",
        "[To Dulag.] The day after my return to Burauen an obliging Spanish\nmerchant drove me through the fertile plain of volcanic sand, on\nwhich rice, maize, and sugar-cane were cultivated, to Dulag, which\nlies directly to the west, on the shore of the tranquil sea. The\ndistance (according to Coello three leagues) hardly amounts to two\nleagues. From this place, Point Guiuan, the south point of Samar,\nappears like an island separated from the mainland, and further south\n(N. 102° 4’ to 103° 65° S.) Jomonjol is seen, the first island of the\nArchipelago sighted by Magellan on April 16, 1521. At Dulag, my former\ncompanion joined us in order to accompany us on the journey to the\nBito Lake. The arrangement of transportation and of provisions, and,\nstill more, the due consideration of all the propositions of three\nindividuals, each of whose claims were entitled to equal respect,\noccupied much time and required some address. We at length sailed\nin a large casco (barge) southwards along the coast to the mouth\nof the river [Up Mayo River.] Mayo, which, according to the map and\nthe information there given, is said to come from the Bito Lake. We\nproceeded upwards in a boat, but were informed at the first hut that\nthe lake could be reached only by making a long circuit through swampy\nforest; when most of our party proposed to return. Various reasons\nbesides the want of unanimity in the conduct of our adventure, which\nhad proceeded thus far, delayed our arrival at Abuyog until eleven\no’clock at night. In the first place, on our way, we had to cross a\nsmall branch of the Mayo, and after that the Bito River. The distance\nof the latter from Abuyog (extravagantly set down on Coello’s map)\namounts to fourteen hundred brazas, according to the measurement of\nthe gobernadorcillo, which is probably correct. [193]",
        "[An unpromising road.] The following day, as it rained heavily, was\nemployed in making inquiries respecting the road to the Bito Lake. We\nreceived very varied statements as to the distance, but all agreed\nin painting the road thither in a discouraging light. A troublesome\njourney of at least ten hours appeared to us to be what most probably\nawaited us.",
        "[Bito Lake.] On the morrow, through a pleasant forest road, we reached\nin an hour the Bito River, and proceeded in boats, which we met\nthere, up the river between flat sandy banks covered with tall cane\nand reeds. In about ten minutes, some trees fallen right across the\nstream compelled us to make a circuit on land, which in half an hour\nbrought us again to the river, above the obstacles. Here we constructed\nrafts of bamboo, upon which, immersed to the depth of half a foot,\nthe material being very loosely adjusted, we reached the lake in ten\nminutes. We found it covered with green confervae; a double border\nof pistia and broad-leaved reed grasses, six to seven feet high,\nenclosing it all round. On the south and west some low hillocks rose\nup, while from the middle it appeared to be almost circular, with a\ngirdle of forest. Coello makes the lake much too large (four instead\nof one square mile), and its distance from Abuyog can be only a little\nover a league. With the assistance of a cord of lianas tied together,\nand rods placed in a line, we found its breadth five hundred and\neighty-five brazas or nine hundred and seventy-seven meters, (in the\nbroadest part it might be a little over one thousand meters); and the\nlength, as computed from some imperfect observations, one thousand\nand seven brazas (sixteen hundred and eighty meters), consequently\nless than one square mile. Soundings showed a gently inclined basin,\neight brazas, or over thirteen meters, deep in the middle. I would\ngladly have determined the proportions with more accuracy; but want of\ntime, the inaccessibility of the edge of the bank, and the miserable\ncondition of our raft, allowed of only a few rough measurements.",
        "[A forest home.] Not a trace of human habitations was observable\non the shore; but a quarter of an hour’s distance from the northern\nedge we found a comfortable hut, surrounded by deep mud and prickly\ncalamus, the tenants of which, however, were living in plenty, and\nwith greater conveniences than many dwellers in the villages. We were\nvery well received and had fish in abundance, as well as tomatoes,\nand capsicum to season them with, and dishes of English earthenware\nout of which to eat them.",
        "[Snaring swine.] The abundance of wild swine had led the settlers\nto invent a peculiar contrivance, by which they are apprised of\ntheir approach even when asleep, and guided to their trail in the\ndarkness. A rope made of strips of banana tied together, and upwards\nof a thousand feet in length, is extended along the ground, one end\nof which is attached to a coconut shell, full of water, which is\nsuspended immediately over the sleeping-place of the hunter. When a\npig comes in contact with the rope, the water is overturned by the\njerk upon the sleeper, who, seizing the rope in his hand, is thereby\nconducted to his prey. The principal employment of our hosts appeared\nto be fishing, which is so productive that the roughest apparatus\nis sufficient. There was not a single boat, but only loosely-bound\nrafts of bamboo, on which the fishers, sinking, as we ourselves did\non our raft, half a foot deep, moved about amongst the crocodiles,\nwhich I never beheld in such numbers and of so large a size as in\nthis lake. Some swam about on the surface with their backs projecting\nout of the water. It was striking to see the complete indifference\nwith which even two little girls waded in the water in the face of\nthe great monsters. Fortunately the latter appeared to be satisfied\nwith their ample rations of fish. Four kinds of fish are said to be\nfound in the lake, amongst them an eel; but we got only one. [194]",
        "[A secret still.] Early on the following morning our native attendants\nwere already intoxicated. This led to the discovery of another\noccupation of the settlers, which I do not hesitate to disclose\nnow that the Government monopoly has been abolished. They secretly\ndistilled palm-brandy and carried on a considerable trade in it; and\nthis also explained to me why the horrors of the road to the Mayo River\nand to Abuyog had been painted in such warm colors. [195] We returned\non our rafts to the place where we had found them, a distance of\nabout fifteen hundred feet; and onwards, through wild cane with large\nclusters of flowers (Saccharum sp.), sixteen feet high, east by north,\nwe got to our boats, and then to the bar, whence, after a march of an\nhour and a half, we reached Abuyog. From Abuyog we returned by water to\nDulag, and by land to Burauen, where we arrived at night, sooner than\nour hostlers had expected, for we caught them sleeping in our beds.",
        "[Tobacco prohibition.] Not long ago much tobacco was cultivated in this\ncountry, and was allowed to be sold to the peasantry under certain\nconditions; but recently it was forbidden to be sold, except by the\nGovernment, who themselves determined its value at so very low a rate\nthat the culture of tobacco has almost entirely ceased. As the tobacco\ncompany, however, had already erected stores and appointed collectors,\nthe knowing ones rightly foresaw that these steps would be followed by\ncompulsory labor, even as it occurred in other places. The east coast\nof Leyte is said to be rising while the west is being destroyed by the\nsea, and at Ormog the sea is said to have advanced about fifty ells\n[196] in six years.",
        "[The Bisayans.] The Bisayans–at least the inhabitants of the\nIslands of Samar and Leyte (I have not become closely acquainted\nwith any others)–belong to one race. [197] They are, physically and\nintellectually, in character, dress, manners and customs, so similar\nthat my notes, which were originally made at different points of\nthe two Islands, have, after removal of the numerous repetitions,\nfused into one, which affords a more complete picture, and affords,\nat the same time, opportunity for the small differences, where they\ndo occur, to stand out more conspicuously.",
        "[Mountaineers.] There are no Negritos either in Samar or Leyte, but\nCimarronese, who pay no tribute, and who do not live in villages,\nbut independently in the forests. Unfortunately I have had no personal\nintercourse with them, and what I have learned respecting them from the\nChristian inhabitants of Samar is too uncertain to be repeated. But it\ndoes seem certain that all these Cimarronese or their ancestors have\ntraded with the Spaniards, and that their religion has appropriated\nmany Catholic forms. Thus, when planting rice, and, according to\nancient practices, setting apart some of the seed to be offered in\nthe four corners of the field as sacrifice, they are accustomed to\nrepeat some mutilated Catholic prayers, which they appear to consider\nas efficacious as their old heathenish ones. Some have their children\nbaptized as well, as it costs nothing; but, save in these respects,\nthey perform no other Christian or civil obligations. They are very\npeaceable, neither making war with one another, nor having poisoned\narrows. Instances of Cimarronese, who go over to Christianity and\nvillage life, together with tribute and servitude, are very rare;\nand the number of the civilized, who return to the forests in order\nto become Cimarronese, is, on the other hand, very inconsiderable\nindeed–still smaller than in Luzon, as the natives, from the dull,\nalmost vegetating life which they lead, are not easily brought into\nsuch straitened circumstances as to be compelled to leave their\nvillage, which, still more than in Luzon, is all the world to them.",
        "[Rice-farming.] The culture of rice follows the seasons of the year. In\nsome places where there are large fields the plough (arado) and the\nsod-sod (here called surod) are employed; but, almost universally, the\nrice-field is only trodden over by carabaos in the rainy season. Sowing\nis done on the west coast in May and June, planting in July and August,\nand reaping from November to January. One ganta of seed-corn gives two,\nsometimes from three to four, cabanes (i.e., fifty, seventy-five,\nand a hundred fold). In the chief town, Catbalogan, there are but\nvery few irrigated fields (tubigan, from tubig, water), the produce\nof which does not suffice for the requirements, and the deficiency\nis made up from other places on the coasts of the Island. On the\nother hand, Catbalogan produces abaca, coco-nut oil, wax, balate\n(edible holothuria, sea cucumber), dried fish, and woven stuffs. On\nthe north and east coasts sowing takes place from November to January,\nand reaping six months later. During the remaining six months the field\nserves as pasture for the cattle; but in many places rice culture goes\non even during these months, but on other fields. A large portion of\nthis rice is frequently lost on account of the bad weather.",
        "[Land tenure.] Purchases of land are seldom made, it being generally\nacquired by cultivation, by inheritance, or forfeiture. In Catbalogan\nthe best rice land was paid for at the rate of one dollar for a ganta\nof seed-corn, and, on the north coast of Lauang, a field producing\nyearly one hundred cabanes was purchased for thirty dollars. Reckoning,\nas in Naga, one ganta of seed-corn at four loanes, and seventy-five\ncabanes of produce at one quiñon, the eastern rice land costs, in\nthe first instance, three thalers and a third, in the second three\nthalers. The owner lets the bare property out on leases, and receives\none-half the harvest as rent. [198] The cultivation of rice in Leyte\nis conducted as in Samar, but it has given way to the cultivation of\nabacá; the governors, while they were allowed to trade, compelled\nthe natives to devote a part of their fields and of their labor to\nit. Should a peasant be in arrears, it is the prevalent custom in\nthe country for him to pay to the dealer double the balance remaining\ndue at the next harvest.",
        "[Mountain rice.] Mountain-rice culture, which in Catbalogan is almost\nthe only cultivation, requires no other implement of agriculture\nthan the bolo to loosen the soil somewhat, and a sharp stick for\nmaking holes at distances of six inches for the reception of five or\nsix grains of rice. Sowing is done from May to June, weeding twice,\nand five months later it is cut stalk by stalk; the reaper receiving\nhalf a real daily wages and food. The produce is between two and three\ncabanes per ganta, or fifty to seventy fold. The land costs nothing,\nand wages amount to nearly five reals per ganta of seed-corn. After a\ngood harvest the caban fetches four reales; but just before the harvest\nthe price rises to one dollar, and often much higher. The ground is\nused only once for dry rice; camote (batata), abacá, and caladium being\nplanted on it after the harvest. Mountain rice is more remunerative\nthan watered rice about in the proportion of nine to eight.",
        "[Other products.] Next to rice the principal articles of sustenance\nare camote (convolvulus batatas), ubi (dioscorea), gabi (caladium),\npalauan (a large arum, with taper leaves and spotted stalk). Camote\ncan be planted all the year around, and ripens in four months; but\nit takes place generally when the rice culture is over, when little\nlabor is available. When the cultivation of camote is retained,\nthe old plants are allowed to multiply their runners, and only the\ntubers are taken out of the ground. But larger produce is obtained by\ncleaning out the ground and planting anew. From eighteen to fifteen\ngantas may be had for half a real.",
        "[Abacá.] Although there are large plantations of abacá, during my\nvisit it was but little cultivated, the price not being sufficiently\nremunerative.",
        "[Tobacco.] Tobacco also is cultivated. Formerly it might be sold in\nthe country, but now it has to be delivered to the government.",
        "[Balao oil.] A resinous oil (balao or malapajo) is found in Samar\nand Albay, probably also in other provinces. It is obtained from a\ndipterocarpus (apiton), one of the loftiest trees of the forest, by\ncutting in the trunk a wide hole, half a foot deep, hollowed out into\nthe form of a basin, and from time to time lighting a fire in it, so as\nto free the channels, through which it flows, of obstructions. The oil\nthus is collected daily and comes into commerce without any further\npreparation. Its chief application is in the preservation of iron\nin shipbuilding. Nails dipped in the oil of the balao, before being\ndriven in, will, as I have been assured by credible individuals,\ndefy the action of rust for ten years; but it is principally used as a\nvarnish for ships, which are painted with it both within and without,\nand it also protects wood against termites and other insects. The\nbalao is sold in Albay at four reals for the tinaja of ten gantas (the\nliter at eight pence). A cement formed by the mixture of burnt lime,\ngum elemi, and coconut oil, in such proportions as to form a thick\npaste before application, is used for the protection of the bottoms\nof ships; and the coating is said to last a year. [199] [Wax.] Wax\nis bartered by the Cimarronese. The whole of Samar annually yields\nfrom two hundred to three hundred piculs, whose value ranges between\ntwenty-five and fifty dollars per picul, while in Manila the price\nis generally five to ten dollars higher; but it fluctuates very much,\nas the same product is brought from many other localities and at very\nirregular intervals of time.",
        "[Scarcity of stock.] There is hardly any breeding of cattle,\nnotwithstanding the luxuriant growth of grasses and the absence of\ndestructive animals. Horses and carabao are very rare, and are said\nto have been introduced late, not before the present century. As in\nSamar there are hardly any other country roads than the seashore and\nthe shallow beds of rivers (it is better in the north of Leyte),\nthe carabao is used only once every year in treading over the\nearth of the rice-field. During the year he roams at large on the\npastures, in the forest, or on a small island, where such exists,\nin the neighborhood. Some times in the year one may see several\ncarabaos, attached to the large trunk of a tree, dragging it to the\nvillage. Their number, consequently, is extremely small. Carabaos\nwhich tread the rice land well are worth as much as ten dollars. The\nmean price is three dollars for a carabao, and five to six dollars\nfor a caraballa. Horned cattle are only occasionally used as victims\nat festivals. The property of several owners, they are very limited in\nnumber, and live half-wild in the mountains. There is hardly any trade\nin them, but the average price is three dollars for a heifer, and five\nor six dollars for a cow. [Swine.] Almost every family possesses a pig;\nsome, three or four of them. A fat pig costs six or seven dollars,\neven more than a cow. Many Filipino tribes abstain strictly from beef;\nbut pork is essential to their feasts. Grease, too, is so dear that\nfrom three to four dollars would, under favorable circumstances,\nbe got on that account for a fat animal. [Sheep and goats.] Sheep\nand goats thrive well, and propagate easily, but also exist only in\nsmall numbers, and are hardly utilized either for their wool or their\nflesh. Creoles and mestizos are for the most part too idle even to\nkeep sheep, preferring daily to eat chicken. The sheep of Shanghai,\nimported by the governor of Tacloban, also thrive and propagate\nfamously. [Poultry.] A laying hen costs half a real, a rooster the\nsame, and a game cock as much as three dollars, often considerably\nmore. Six or eight hens, or thirty eggs, may be bought for one real.",
        "[Cost of food.] A family consisting of father, mother, and five\nchildren requires daily nearly twenty-four chupas of palay (rice in\nthe husk), which, after winnowing, comes to about twelve chupas. This\nat the average price of four reals per cavan costs about half a\nreal. The price, however, varies. Sometimes, after the harvest, it\nis three reals per cavan; before it, ten; and in Albay, even about\nthirty reals. Then about three cuartos are wanted for extras (as fish,\ncrabs, vegetables, etc.), which, however, are generally collected\nby the children; and, lastly, for oil two cuartos, buyo one cuarto,\ntobacco three cuartos (three leaves for one cuarto), the latter being\nsmoked, not chewed. A woman consumes half as much buyo and tobacco\nas a man. Buyo and tobacco are less used in Leyte than in Samar.",
        "[Clothing cost.] For clothing a man requires yearly–four rough\nshirts of guinara, costing from one to two reals; three or four pairs\nof trousers, at one to two and a half reals; two kerchiefs for the\nhead, at one and a half real (hats are not worn on the south and west\ncoasts), and for the church festivals generally one pair of shoes,\nseven reals; one fine shirt, a dollar or more; and fine pantaloons,\nat four reals. A woman requires–four to six camisas of guinara,\nat one real; two to three sayas of guinara, at three to four reals,\nand one or two sayas of European printed cotton, at five reals; two\nhead-kerchiefs at one and a half to two reals; and one or two pairs\nof slippers (chinelas) to go to mass in, at two reals and upwards.",
        "[Women’s extras.] The women generally have, besides, a fine camisa\ncosting at least six reals; a mantilla for churchgoing, six reals\n(it lasts four years); and a comb, two cuartos. Many also have under\nskirts (nabuas), two pieces at four reals, and earrings of brass\nand a rosary, which last articles are purchased once for all. In the\npoorer localities, Lauang for instance, only the home-woven guinaras\nare worn; and there a man requires–three shirts and three pairs of\ntrousers, which are cut out of three pieces of guinara, at two reals,\nand a salacot (hat), generally home made, worth half a real; while a\nwoman uses yearly–four sayas, value six reals; and a camisa, with a\nfiner one for the festivals, eight reals. Underskirts are not worn;\nand the clothing of the children may be estimated at about half of\nthe above rates.",
        "[Household furniture.] For household furniture a family has a cooking\npot [200] of unglazed burnt clay, imported by ships from Manila, the\ncost of which is fixed by the value of its contents in rice; a supply\nof bamboo-canes; seven plates, costing between two and five cuartos;\na carahai (iron pan), three to four reals; coconut shells serving\nfor glasses; a few small pots, altogether half a real; a sundang,\nfour to six reals, or a bolo (large forest knife), one dollar; and\na pair of scissors (for the women), two reals. The loom, which every\nhousehold constructs for itself of bamboo of course costs nothing.",
        "[Wages.] The rate of daily wages, in the case of Filipino employers,\nis half a real, without food; but Europeans always have to give\none real and food, unless, by favor of the gobernadorcillo, they\nget polistas at the former rate, which then regularly goes into the\npublic coffers. An ordinary carpenter earns from one to two reals;\na skilful man, three reals daily. The hours of work are from six to\nnoon, and from two to six in the evening.",
        "[Industries.] Almost every village has a rude smith, who understands\nthe making of sundangs and bolos; but the iron and the coal required\nfor the purpose must be supplied with the order. No other work in\nmetal is executed. With the exception of a little ship-building,\nhardly any other pursuit than weaving is carried on; the loom is\nrarely wanting in a household. Guinara, i.e., stuff made of the abacá,\nis manufactured, as well as also some piña, or figured silk stuffs,\nthe silk being brought from Manila, and of Chinese origin. All these\nfabrics are made in private homes; there are no factories.",
        "[Barter.] In places where rice is scarce the lower class of people\ncatch fish, salt and dry them, and barter them for rice. In the\nchief towns purchases are made with the current money; but, in the\ninterior, where there is hardly any money, fabrics and dried fish are\nthe most usual means of exchange. Salt is obtained by evaporating\nthe seawater in small iron hand-pans (carahais), without previous\nevaporation in the sun. The navigation between Catbalogan and Manila\ncontinues from December to July, and in the interval between those\nmonths the ships lie dismantled under sheds. [Communication.] There\nalso is communication by the coast eastwards to Guian, northwards\nto Catarman, and sometimes to Lauang. The crews consist partly of\nnatives, and partly of foreigners, as the natives take to the sea\nwith great reluctance; indeed, almost only when compelled to leave\ntheir villages. Samar has scarcely any other means of communication\nbesides the navigation of the coast and rivers, the interior being\nroadless; and burdens have to be conveyed on the shoulders. An\nable-bodied porter, who receives a real and a half without food,\nwill carry three arrobas (seventy-five pounds at most) six leagues in\na day, but he cannot accomplish the same work on the following day,\nrequiring at least one day’s rest. A strong man will carry an arroba\nand a half daily for a distance of six leagues for a whole week.",
        "[No markets.] There are no markets in Samar and Leyte; so that whoever\nwishes to buy seeks what he requires in the houses, and in like manner\nthe seller offers his goods.",
        "[Debts.] A Filipino seeking to borrow money has to give ample security\nand pay interest at the rate of one real for every dollar per month\n(twelve and one-half per cent. monthly); and it is not easy for\nhim to borrow more than five dollars, for which sum only he is\nlegally liable. Trade and credit are less developed in eastern and\nnorthern Samar than in the western part of the island, which keeps\nup a more active communication with the other inhabitants of the\nArchipelago. There current money is rarely lent, but only its value\nin goods is advanced at the rate of a real per dollar per mensem. If\nthe debtor fails to pay within the time appointed, he frequently\nhas to part with one of his children, who is obliged to serve the\nlender for his bare food, without wages, until the debt has been\nextinguished. I saw a young man who had so served for the term of\nfive years, in liquidation of a debt of five dollars which his father,\nwho had formerly been a gobernadorcillo in Paranas, owed to a mestizo\nin Catbalogan; and on the east coast a pretty young girl, who, for\na debt of three dollars due by her father, had then, for two years,\nserved a native, who had the reputation of being a spendthrift. I was\nshown in Borongan a coconut plantation of three hundred trees, which\nwas pledged for a debt of ten dollars about twenty years ago, since\nwhich period it had been used by the creditor as his own property;\nand it was only a few years since that, upon the death of the debtor,\nhis children succeeded, with great difficulty, in paying the original\ndebt and redeeming the property. It is no uncommon thing for a native\nto borrow two dollars and a half from another in order to purchase\nhis exemption from the forty days of annual service, and then,\nfailing to repay the loan punctually, to serve his creditor for a\nwhole year. [201]",
        "[People of Samar and Leyte.] The inhabitants of Samar and Leyte,\nwho are at once idler and filthier than those of Luzon, seem to be\nas much behind the Bicols as the latter are behind the Tagalogs. In\nTacloban, where a more active intercourse with Manila exists, these\nqualities are less pronounced, and the women, who are agreeable,\nbathe frequently. For the rest, the inhabitants of the two islands\nare friendly, obliging, tractable, and peaceable. Abusive language or\nviolence very rarely occurs, and, in case of injury, information is\nlaid against the offender at the tribunal. Great purity of manners\nseems to prevail on the north and west coasts, but not on the east\ncoast, nor in Leyte. External piety is universally conspicuous, through\nthe training imparted by the priests; the families are very united,\nand great influence is wielded by the women, who are principally\nengaged in household employments, and are tolerably skilful in weaving,\nand to whom only the lighter labors of the field are assigned. The\nauthority of the parents and of the eldest brother is supreme, the\nyounger sisters never venturing to oppose it; women and children are\nkindly treated.",
        "[Leyte.] The natives of Leyte, clinging as strongly to their native\nsoil as those of Samar, like them, have no partiality for the sea,\nthough their antipathy to it is not quite so manifest as that of the\ninhabitants of Samar. [202]",
        "[Public charity not accepted.] There are no benevolent institutions\nin either of the two islands. Each family maintains its own poor\nand crippled, and treats them tenderly. In Catbalogan, the chief\ntown of the island, with five to six thousand inhabitants, there\nwere only eight recipients of charity; but in Albay mendicants are\nnot wanting. In Lauang, when a Spaniard, on a solemn festival, had\ncaused it to be proclaimed that he would distribute rice to the poor,\nnot a single applicant came forward. The honesty of the inhabitants of\nSamar is much commended. Obligations are said to be contracted almost\nalways without written documents, and never forsworn, even if they\nmake default in payment. Robberies are of rare occurrence in Samar,\nand thefts almost unknown. There are schools also here in the pueblos,\nwhich accomplish quite as much as they do in Camarines.",
        "[Amusements.] Of the public amusements cock-fighting is the chief,\nbut it is not so eagerly pursued as in Luzon. At the church festivals\nthey perform a drama translated from the Spanish, generally of\na religious character; and the expense of the entertainment is\ndefrayed by voluntary contributions of the wealthy. The chief vices\nof the population are play and drunkenness; in which latter even\nwomen and young girls occasionally indulge. The marriage feasts,\ncombining song and dance, often continue for several days and\nnights together, where they have a sufficient supply of food and\ndrink. [Suitor’s service.] The suitor has to serve in the house\nof the bride’s parents two, three, and even five years, before he\ntakes his bride home; and money cannot purchase exemption from this\nonerous restriction. He boards in the house of the bride’s parents\nwho furnish the rice, but he has to supply the vegetables himself.\n[203] At the expiration of his term of service he builds, with the\nassistance of his relations and friends, the house for the family\nwhich is about to be newly established.",
        "[Morals.] Though adultery is not unknown, jealousy is rare, and\nnever leads to violence. The injured individual generally goes with\nthe culprit to the minister, who, with a severe lecture to one,\nand words of consolation to the other, sets everything straight\nagain. Married women are more easily accessible than girls, whose\nprospect of marriage, however, it seems is not greatly diminished\nby a false step during single life. While under parental authority\ngirls, as a rule, are kept under rigid control, doubtless in order\nto prolong the time of servitude of the suitor. External appearance\nis more strictly regarded among the Bisayans than by the Bicols and\nTagalogs. Here also the erroneous opinion prevails, that the number of\nthe women exceeds that of the men. Instances occur of girls of twelve\nbeing mothers; but they are rare; and though women bear twelve or\nthirteen children, many of these, however, do not live. [Great infant\nmortality.] So much so is this the case, that families of more than\nsix or eight children are very rarely met with.",
        "[Superstitions.] Superstition is rife. Besides the little church images\nof the Virgin, which every Filipina wears by a string round the neck,\nmany also have heathen amulets, of which I had an opportunity of\nexamining one that had been taken from a very daring criminal. It\nconsisted of a small ounce flask, stuffed full of vegetable root\nfibres, which appeared to have been fried in oil. This flask, which is\nprepared by the heathen tribes, is accredited with the virtue of making\nits owner strong and courageous. The capture of this individual was\nvery difficult; but, as soon as the little flask was taken from him,\nhe gave up all resistance, and allowed himself to be bound. In almost\nevery large village there are one or more [Ghouls.] Asuang families who\nare generally dreaded and avoided, and regarded as outlaws, and who\ncan marry only amongst themselves. They have the reputation of being\ncannibals. [204] Perhaps they are descended from such tribes? At any\nrate, the belief is very general and firmly  rooted; and intelligent\nold natives when questioned by me on the subject, answered that they\ncertainly did not believe that the Asuangs ate men at the present time,\nbut that their forefathers had assuredly done so. [205]",
        "[Ancient Literature.] Of ancient legends, traditions, or ballads,\nit is stated that there are none. It is true they have songs at their\ndances, but these are spiritless improvisations, and mostly in a high\nkey. They have not preserved any memorials of former civilization. “The\nancient Pintados possessed no temples, every one performing his\nanitos in his own house, without any special solemnity\"–(Morga,\nf. 145 v). Pigafetta (p. 92) certainly mentions that the King of Cebu,\nafter his conversion to Christianity, caused many temples built on the\nseashore to be destroyed; but these might only have been structures of\na very perishable kind. [Festivals and shrines.] On certain occasions\nthe Bisayans celebrated a great festival, called Pandot, at which\nthey worshipped their gods in huts, which were expressly built for the\npurpose, covered with foliage, and adorned with flowers and lamps. They\ncalled these huts simba or simbahan (the churches are so called to the\npresent day), “and this is the only thing which they have similar to a\nchurch or a temple\"–(Informe, I., i., 17). According to Gemelli Careri\nthey prayed to some particular gods, derived from their forefathers,\nwho are called by the Bisayans Davata (Divata), and by the Tagalogs\nAnito; one anito being for the sea and another for the house, to\nwatch over the children. [206] [Ancestor worship.] In the number of\nthese anitos they placed their grandfathers and great-grandfathers,\nwhom they invoked in all their necessities, and in whose honor they\npreserved little statues of stone, wood, gold, and ivory, which they\ncalled liche or laravan. Amongst their gods they also reckoned all\nwho perished by the sword, or were killed by lightning, or devoured\nby crocodiles, believing that their souls ascended to heaven on a\nbow which they called balangas. Pigafetta thus describes the idols\nwhich were seen by him:–\"They are of wood, and concave, or hollow,\nwithout any hind quarters, with their arms extended, and their legs\nand feet bent upwards. They have very large faces, with four powerful\nteeth like boars’ tusks, and are painted all over.” [207]",
        "In conclusion, let me take a brief account of the religion of the\nancient Bisayans from Fr. Gaspar San Agustin (Conquest, 169):",
        "[Old religion.] The daemon, or genius, to whom they sacrificed was\ncalled by them Divata, which appears to denote an antithesis to the\nDeity, and a rebel against him. Hell was called Solad, and Heaven\n(in the language of the educated people) Ologan * * * The souls of\nthe departed go to a mountain in the province of Oton, [208] called\nMedias, where they are well entertained and served. The creation of\nthe universe is thus explained. [Creation myth.] A vulture hovering\nbetween heaven and earth finds no place to settle himself upon,\nand the water rises towards heaven; whereupon Heaven, in its wrath,\ncreates islands. The vulture splits a bamboo, out of which spring man\nand woman, who beget many children, and, when their number becomes\ntoo great, drive them out with blows. Some conceal themselves in the\nchamber, and these become the Datos; others in the kitchen, and these\nbecome the slaves. The rest go down the stairs and become the people.",
        "[Ports of entry.] In 1830 seven new ports were opened as an experiment,\nbut, owing to great frauds in the charges, were soon afterwards\nclosed again. In 1831 a custom-house was established at Zamboanga,\non the south-west point of Mindanao; and in 1855 Sual, in the Gulf\nof Lingayen, one of the safest harbors on the west coast of Luzon,\nand Iloilo in Panay, were thrown open; and in 1863 Cebu, on the island\nof the same name, for the direct communication with foreign countries.",
        "[Old Zamboanga fort.] Before 1635 the Spaniards had established\na fort at Zamboanga, which, although it certainly could not\nwholly prevent the piratical excursions against the colonies, yet\nconsiderably diminished them. [209] Until 1848 from eight hundred\nto fifteen hundred individuals are stated to have been carried off\nyearly by the Moros. [210] The establishment of this custom-house\nhas, therefore, been based upon political rather than commercial\nmotives, it being found desirable to open an easily accessible\nplace to the piratical states of the Sulu Sea for the disposal of\ntheir products. [Exports.] Trade, up to the present date, is but\nof very inconsiderable amount, the exports consisting chiefly of a\nlittle coffee (in 1871 nearly six thousand piculs), which, from bad\nmanagement, is worth thirty per cent. less than Manila coffee, and of\nthe collected products of the forest and of the water, such as wax,\nbirds’-nests, tortoise-shell, pearls, mother-of-pearl, and edible\nholothuria. This trade, as well as that with Sulu, is entirely in the\nhands of the Chinese, who alone possess the patience, adaptiveness,\nand adroitness which are required for the purpose.",
        "[Sual’s foreign trade.] Sual is specially important for its exports\nof rice; and its foreign trade is therefore affected by the results of\nthe harvests in Saigon, Burma, and China. In 1868, when the harvests in\nthose countries turned out good, Sual carried on only a coasting trade.",
        "[Cebu.] Cebu (with a population of 34,000) is the chief town of the\nisland of the same name, the seat of Government and of the bishop of\nthe Bisayas, and within forty-eight hours from Manila by steamer. It\nis as favorably situated with regard to the eatern portion of the\nBisayan group as Iloilo is for the western, and is acquiring increased\nimportance as the emporium for its products. Sugar and tobacco are\nobtained from Bohol; rice from Panay; abacá from Leyte and Mindanao;\nand coffee, wax, Spanish cane, and mother-of-pearl from Misamis\n(Mindanao). Its distance from Samar is twenty-six, from Leyte two\nand a half, from Bohol four, and from Negros eighteen miles.",
        "[Cebu island.] The island of Cebu extends over seventy-five square\nmiles. A lofty mountain range traverses it from north to south,\ndividing the east from the west side, and its population is\nestimated at 340,000,–4,533 to the square mile. The inhabitants\nare peaceable and docile; thefts occur very seldom, and robberies\nnever. Their occupations are agriculture, fishing, and weaving for\nhome consumption. Cebu produces sugar, tobacco, maize, rice, etc.,\nand in the mountains potatoes; but the rice produced does not suffice\nfor their requirements, there being only a little level land, and\nthe deficiency is imported from Panay.",
        "[Land tenure.] The island possesses considerable beds of coal, the\nfull yield of which may now be looked for, as the duty on export was\nabandoned by a decree of the 5th of May, 1869. [211] While in Luzon\nand Panay the land is for the most part the property of the peasantry,\nin Cebu it mostly belongs to the mestizos, and is let out by them,\nin very small allotments, upon lease. The owners of the soil know how\nto keep the peasants in a state of dependence by usurious loans; and\none of the results of this abuse is that agriculture in this island\nstands lower than in almost any other part of the archipelago. [212]\n[Customhouse data.] The entire value of the exports in 1868 amounted\nto $1,181,050; of which sugar to the value of $481,127, and abacá to\nthe value of $378,256; went to England, abacá amounting to $112,000\nto America, and tobacco to $118,260 to Spain. The imports of foreign\ngoods, mostly by the Chinese, come through Manila, where they\npurchase from the foreign import houses. The value of these imports\namounted in 1868 to $182,522; of which $150,000 were for English\ncotton stuffs. The entire imports of the island were estimated at\n$1,243,582, and the exports at $226,898. Among the importations\nwere twenty chests of images, a sign of the deeply-rooted worship\nof the Virgin. Formerly the products for exportation were bought up\nby the foreign merchants, mostly Chinese mestizos; but now they are\nbought direct from the producers, who thus obtain better prices in\nconsequence of the abolition of the high brokerages. To this and to\nthe energy of the foreign merchants, under favorable circumstances,\nis the gradual improvement of agriculture principally to be ascribed.",
        "[Iloilo.] Iloilo is the most important of the newly opened ports,\nbeing the central point of the Bisayan group, and situated in one\nof the most thickly populated and industrious provinces. Nicholas\nLoney [213] estimates the export of goods woven from the fiber of\nthe piña, from Iloilo, and the neighboring provinces, at about one\nmillion dollars annually. The harbor is excellent, being completely\nprotected by an island which lies immediately before it; and at high\ntide there is about twelve feet of water close in shore for vessels\nto lie in. On account of the bar, however, ships of a deeper draught\nthan this are obliged to complete their loading outside. Previous\nto the opening of the new harbors, all the provinces were compelled\nas well to bring their products intended for exportation to Manila,\nas to receive from the same place their foreign imports; the cost\nof which therefore was greatly increased through the extra expenses\nincurred by the double voyage, reloading, brokerage, and wharfage\ncharges. According to a written account by N. Loney, it is shown how\nprofitable, even after a few years, the opening of Iloilo has been to\nthe provinces immediately adjoining–the islands of Panay and Negros.",
        "[Sugar.] The higher prices which can be obtained for directly\nexported sugar, combined with the facility and security of the\ntrade as contrasted with the late monopoly enjoyed by Manila, have\noccasioned a great extension of the cultivation of that article. Not\nonly in Iloilo, but also in Antique and Negros, many new plantations\nhave arisen, and the old ones have been enlarged as much as possible;\nand not less important has been the progress in the manufacture. In\n1857 there was not one iron mill to be found on the island; so that,\nin working with the wooden mill, about thirty per cent. of the sap\nremained in the cane, even after it had thrice passed through. The\nold wooden presses, which were worked by steam or carabaos, have now\nbeen supplanted by new ones; and these the native planters have no\ndifficulty in obtaining, as they can get them on credit from the\nwarehouses of the English importers. Instead of the old Chinese\ncast-iron pans which were in use, far superior articles have been\nimported from Europe; and many large factories worked by steam-power\nand with all modern improvements have been established. In agriculture,\nlikewise, creditable progress is noticeable. Improved ploughs, carts,\nand farming implements generally, are to be had in plenty. These\nchanges naturally show how important it was to establish at different\npoints, extending over two hundred miles of the Archipelago, commercial\ncenters, where it was desirable that foreigners should settle. Without\nthese latter, and the facilities afforded to credit which thereby\nensued, the sudden rise and prosperity of Iloilo would not have been\npossible, inasmuch as the mercantile houses in that capital would have\nbeen debarred from trading with unknown planters in distant provinces,\notherwise than for ready money. A large number of half-castes, too,\nwho before traded in manufactured goods purchased in Manila, were\nenabled after this to send their goods direct to the provinces, to the\nforeign firms settled there; and as, ultimately, neither these latter\nnor the Chinese retail dealers could successfully compete with them,\nthe result has been that, as much to their own profit as to that of the\ncountry, they have betaken themselves to the cultivation of sugar. In\nthis manner important plantations have been established in Negros,\nwhich are managed by natives of Iloilo: but there is a scarcity of\nlaborers on the island.",
        "[Land disputes.] Foreigners now can legally acquire property, and\npossess a marketable title; in which respect the law, until a very\nrecent period, was of an extremely uncertain nature. Land is to be\nobtained by purchase, or, when not already taken up, by “denuncia\"\n(i.e. priority of claim). In such case, the would-be possessor of\nthe land must enter into an undertaking in the nearest of the native\nCourts to cultivate and keep the said land in a fit and serviceable\ncondition. Should no other claim be put in, notice is thereupon given\nof the grant, and the magistrate or alcalde concludes the compact\nwithout other cost than the usual stamp duty.",
        "[Lack of capital for large plantations.] Many mestizos and natives,\nnot having the necessary capital to carry on a large plantation\nsuccessfully, sell the fields which they have already partially\ncultivated to European capitalists, who are thus relieved of all the\npreliminary tedious work. Evidently the Colonial Government is now\nsincerely disposed to favor the laying out of large plantations.",
        "[Lack of roads.] The want of good roads is particularly felt: but, with\nthe increase of agriculture, this defect will naturally be remedied;\nand, moreover, most of the sugar factories are situated on rivers which\nare unnavigable even by flat freight boats. The value of land in many\nparts of the country has doubled within the last ten years. [214]",
        "[Sugar prices.] Up to 1854 the picul of sugar was worth in Iloilo from\n$1.05 to $1.25 and seldom over $2.00 in Manila; in 1866, $3.25; and\nin 1868, $4.75 to $5.00 in Iloilo. The business in Iloilo therefore\nshows an increase of $1.75 per picul. [215]",
        "[Negros.] At the end of 1856 there were as many as twenty Europeans\nestablished on the island of Negros as sugar planters, besides a\nnumber of mestizos. Some of them were working with steam machinery\nand vacuum pans. The general rate of pay is from $2.05 to $3.00 per\nmonth. On some plantations the principle of acsa, i.e. part share,\nis in operation. The owner lets out a piece of ground, providing\ndraught cattle and all necessary ploughing implements, to a native,\nwho works it, and supplies the mill with the cut cane, receiving as\npayment a share, generally a third, of the product. In Negros the\nviolet cane is cultivated, and in Manila the white (Otaheiti). The\nland does not require manuring. On new ground, or what we may term\nvirgin soil, the cane often grows to a height of thirteen feet. A vast\nimprovement is to be observed in the mode of dress of the people. Piña\nand silk stuffs are beoming quite common. Advance in luxury is always\na favorable sign; according to the increase of requirements, industry\nflourishes in proportion.",
        "[The future sugar market.] As I have already mentioned,\nCalifornia, Japan, China, and Australia appear designed by nature\nto be the principal consumers of the products of the Philippine\nIslands. Certainly at present England is the best customer; but\nnearly half the account is for sugar, in consequence of their own\ncustom duties. Sometimes it happens that not more than one-fourth of\nthe sugar crop is sufficiently refined to compete in the Australian\nand Californian markets with the sorts from Bengal, Java, and the\nMauritius; the remaining three-fourths, if particularly white, must\nperforce undertake the long voyage to England, despite the high freight\nand certain loss on the voyage of from ten to twelve per cent. through\nthe leakage of the molasses. The inferior quality of the Philippine\nsugar is at once perceived by the English refiners, and is only taxed\nat 8s. per cwt., while purer sorts pay 10s. to 12s. [216]",
        "[A valuable by-product.] In this manner the English customs favor the\ninferior qualities of manufactured sugar. The colonial Government\ndid not allow those engaged in the manufacture of sugar to distil\nrum from the molasses until the year 1862. They had, therefore,\nlittle inducement to extract, at a certain expense, a substance the\nvalue on which they were not permitted to realize; but under ordinary\ncircumstances the distillation of the rum not only covered the cost\nof refining, but gave, in addition, a fair margin of profit.",
        "[Manila hemp.] One of the most interesting productions of the island\nis Manila hemp. The French, who, however, hardly use it, call it\n\"Silk-Plant,” because of its silky appearance.",
        "The natives call the fiber bandala, and in commerce (generally\nspeaking) abacá, just as the plant from which it is obtained.",
        "[Abacá.] The latter is a wild species of banana growing in the\nPhilippine Islands, known also as Arbol de Cañamo (hemp-tree), Musa\ntextilis, Lin. It does not differ in appearance to any great extent\nfrom the edible banana (Musa paradisiaca), one of the most important\nplants of the torrid zone, and familiar to us as being one of our\nmost beautiful hot-house favorites.",
        "[Undetermined plant relations.] Whether this and the “musae\"\n(M. troglodytarum, M. sylvestris, and others), frequently known,\ntoo, as M. textilis, are of the same species, has not yet been\ndetermined. The species Musaceae are herbaceous plants only. The\nouter stem consists of crescent-shaped petioles crossing one another\nalternately, and encircling the thin main stem. These petioles contain\na quantity of bast fiber, which is used as string, but otherwise is\nof no commercial value. The serviceable hemp fiber has, up to the\npresent time, been exclusively obtained from the southern portion of\nthe Philippines.",
        "[Abacá districts.] The southern Camarines and Albay are favorably\nadapted for the cultivation of this plant, as are also the islands\nof Samar and Leyte, and the adjacent islands; and Cebu likewise,\nalthough a portion of the so-called “Cebu hemp” comes from Mindanao. In\nNegros the bast-banana thrives only in the south, not in the north;\nand Iloilo, which produces most of the hemp cloth (guinara), is\nobliged to import the raw material from the eastern district, as it\ndoes not flourish in the island of Panay. In Capiz, it is true, some\nabacá may be noticed growing, but it is of trifling value. Hitherto\nall attempts, strenuous though the efforts were, to acclimatize the\ngrowth of hemp in the western and northern provinces have failed. The\nplants rarely grow as high as two feet, and the trouble and expense\nare simply unremunerative. This failure may be accounted for by the\nextreme dryness prevailing during many months of the year, whereas\nin the eastern provinces plentiful showers fall the whole year round.",
        "[Peculiar to the Philippines.] The great profit which the Manila\nhemp has yielded in the few years since its production, however, has\ngiven encouragement to still further experiments; so that, indeed,\nit will shortly be shown whether the cultivation of abacá is to be\nconfined to its present limited area, while the edible species of\nbanana has spread itself over the whole surface of the earth within\nthe tropics. On the volcanic mountains of Western Java a species\nof the Musaceae grows in great luxuriance. The Government has not,\nhowever, made any real effort to cultivate it, and what has been done\nin that respect has been effected, up to the present date, by private\nenterprise. Various writers have stated that abacá is to be obtained\nin the north of the Celebes. Bickmore, however, says positively that\nthe inhabitants having made great efforts in attempting its successful\ncultivation, have abandoned it again in favor of the cultivation of\ncoffee, which is found to be far more profitable. [217] According to\nprevious statements, Guadaloupe appears to be able to produce abacá\n(fiber of the M. textilis?); [218] and Pondicherry and Guadaloupe\nhave produced fabrics woven from abacá, and French Guiana stuffs\nfrom the fiber of the edible banana; [219] all these, however, are\nonly experiments.",
        "[Superiority of fiber.] Royle affirms that the Manila hemp (abacá\nfiber) excels the Russian in firmness, lightness, and strength in\ntension, as well as in cheapness, and has only the one disadvantage\nthat ropes made from it become stiff in wet weather. The reason,\nhowever, is found in the manner in which it is spun, and may be\navoided by proper preparation. [220] Through the better preparation\nof the raw material in Manila by means of adequate machinery, these\ndifficulties have been overcome; but abacá no longer has the advantage\nof superior cheapness, as the demand has increased much faster than\nthe supply. During the year 1859 it was worth from £22 to £25 per ton;\nin 1868, £45 per ton; while Russian hemp fetched £31 per ton. Thus\nin nine years it rose to double its value.",
        "[Banana varieties.] In Albay there are about twelve varieties\nof the best banana cultivated, which are particularly favored by\nthe qualities of the soil. The cultivation is extremely simple,\nand entirely independent of the seasons. The plants thrive best on\nthe slopes of the volcanic mountains (in which Albay and Camarines\nabound), in open spaces of the woods protected by the trees, which\ncast their shadows to an extent of about sixty feet. In exposed level\nground they do not thrive so well, and in marshy land not at all.",
        "[Cultivation.] In the laying out of a new plantation the young shoots\nare generally made use of, which sprout so abundantly from the roots\nthat each individual one soon becomes a perfect plant. In favorable\nground the custom is to allow a distance of about ten feet between\neach plant; in poor ground six feet. The only care necessary is\nthe extermination of the weeds, and clearing away the undergrowth\nduring the first season; later on, the plants grow so luxuriantly\nand strongly that they entirely prevent the growth of anything\nelse in their vicinity. The protection afforded by the shade of the\ntrees at this period is no longer required, the young buds finding\nsufficient protection against the sun’s rays under cover of the\nfan-like leaves. Only in exceptional cases, contrary to the usual\npractice, are the plants raised from seed. The fruit, when ready,\nis cut off and dried, though care must be taken that it is not over\nripe; otherwise the kernels will not germinate. These latter are about\nthe size of peppercorns; and the extraction of them in the edible\nspecies almost always brings about decay. Two days before sowing,\nthe kernels are taken out of the fruit, and steeped overnight in\nwater; on the following day they are dried in a shady place; and on\nthe third day they are sown in holes an inch deep in fresh, unbroken,\nand well-shaded forest ground, allowing six inches distance between\neach plant and row. After a year the seedlings, which are then about\ntwo feet high, are planted out, and tended in the same way as the\nsuckers. [Differences with abacá.] While many of the edible bananas\nbear fruit after one year, and a few varieties even after six months,\nthe abacá plant requires on an average three years to produce its\nfiber in a proper condition; when raised from suckers four years;\nand raised from year-old seedlings, even under the most favorable\nconditions, two years.",
        "[Cutting.] On the first crop, only one stalk is cut from each bush;\nbut later on the new branches grow so quickly that they can be cut\nevery two months. [221] After a few years the plants become so strong\nand dense that it is scarcely possible to push through them. Bast is\nin its best condition at the time of blossoming; but, when the price\nof the fiber happens to stand high in the market, this particular\ntime is not always waited for.",
        "[Prejudice against cutting after blossoming.] Plants which have\nblossomed cease to be profitable in any way, by reason of the fiber\nbecoming too weak–a matter of too great nicety for the unpractical\nconsumers on the other side of the Atlantic to decide upon, and one\nin which, despite inquiries and careful inspections, they might be\ndeceived. There really is no perceptible reason why the fiber should\nbecome weaker through fructification, which simply consists in the fact\nof the contents of the vascular cells changing into soluble matter,\nand gradually oozing away, the consequence of which is that the cells\nof the fiber are not replenished. These, on the contrary, acquire\nadditional strength with the age of the plant, because the emptied\ncells cling so firmly together, by means of a certain resinous deposit,\nthat it is impossible to obtain them unbroken without a great deal of\ntrouble. The idea may have erroneously arisen from the circumstance\nthat, previously to drying, as with hemp, the old plants were picked\nout, and allowed to be thrown away, though not without considerably\nincreasing the rate of pay, which already consumed the greater part\nof the general expenses. [222]",
        "[Extracting the fiber.] In order to obtain the bast, the stalk above\nground is closely pruned and freed from leaves and other encumbrances;\neach leaf is then singly divided into strips–a cross incision being\nmade through the membrane on the inner or concave side, and connected\nby means of the pulpy parts (the parenchym) clinging together. In\nthis manner as much as possible of the clear outer skin only remains\nbehind. Another method is to strip the bast from the undivided stem. To\neffect this the operator makes an oblique incision in the skin of\nthe under part of the stalk, drawing the knife gradually to the tip,\nand stripping off the whole length as broad a piece as possible; and\nthe operation is repeated as many times as practicable. This method\nof handling is more productive than the one previously described;\nbut, on the other hand, it takes considerably more time, and for\nthat reason is not often practised. The strips of bast are then drawn\nunder a knife, the blade of which is three inches broad by six long,\nfastened at one end to the extremity of a flexible stick so that it\nis suspended perpendicularly over a well-smoothed block, and at the\nother end to a handle connected by means of a cord to a treadle, which\ncan be pressed firmly down, as occasion requires. The workman draws\nthe bast, without any regard to quality, between the knife and block,\ncommencing in the middle, and then from side to side. The knife must\nbe free from notches, or all indentations, according to the direction\nof Father Blanco. [223]",
        "[Laborers’ work and wages.] Three hired-men usually get twenty-five\npounds per day. One worker cuts up the stalks, strips off the leaves,\nand attends to the supply; the second, frequently a boy, spreads out\nthe strips; and the third draws them under the knife. A single plant\nhas been known to yield as much as two pounds of fiber; but the most\nfavorable average rarely affords more than one pound, and plants grown\nin indifferent soil scarcely a sixth of that quantity. The plantations\nare worked either by the owner or by day-laborers, who, when the market\nprices are very low, take half share of the crop harvested by them. In\nthese cases an industrious workman may obtain as much as one picul in\na week. During my stay exceptionally low prices ruled–sixteen and\none-half reals per picul undelivered. The workman could, therefore,\nin six days earn half the amount, viz., eight and a quarter reals at\na rate of one and three-eighths reals per day. The day’s pay at that\ntime was half a real, and board a quarter of a real, making together\nthree-quarters of a real.",
        "[Profit.]",
        "                                        By daily pay.   Half share.",
        "The workman therefore earned daily                   0.75 r. or     1.375 r.\nWages amounted to per picul                         12. 6 r. or     8. 25 r.\nProfit of the planters after deduction of the wages  3. 9 r. or     8. 25 r.",
        "[Lupis and bandala.] The edges of the petioles, which contain much\nfiner fiber than the middle parts, are separately divided into strips\nan inch wide, and with strong pressure are drawn several times under\nthe knife. This substance, which is called lupis, is in high request,\nbeing employed in the native weaving; while is chiefly used for ships’\nrigging. [224]",
        "[Grades of Lupis.] Lupis, according to the fineness of the fiber,\nis sorted into four classes–first, Binani; second, Totogna; third,\nSogotan; and fourth, Cadaclan. A bundle of these is then taken up in\nthe left hand, and, while with the right the first three sorts are\ninserted between the fingers, the fourth is held between the thumb and\nforefinger. This last description is no longer used in fine weaving,\nand is therefore sold with bandala. After the fine sorts have been\npounded in a rice-mortar, in order to render the fiber soft and\npliable, they are severally knotted into one another, and converted\ninto web.",
        "[Lupis fabrics.] Generally the first sort is worked as woof with the\nsecond as warp, and the third as warp with the second as woof. The\nfabrics so woven are nearly as fine as piña fabrics (Nipis de Piña),\nand almost equal the best quality of cambric; and, notwithstanding\nthe many little nodules occasioned by the tangling of the fiber,\nwhich may be discerned on close inspection, are clearer and stouter,\nand possess a warmer yellowish tint. [225] As to these last three\nqualities–purity, flexibility, and color–they stand in relation to\ncambric somewhat as cardboard to tissue-paper.",
        "[Weaving.] Weaving such fabrics on very simple looms is exceedingly\ntroublesome as the fibers, which are not spun but twisted, very\nfrequently break. The finest stuffs require so great an amount of\ndexterity, patience, and time in their preparation, and for that reason\nare so expensive, that they would find no purchasers in Europe where\nthere is the competition of cheap, machine-made goods. Their fine,\nwarm yellowish color also is objected to by the European women, who are\naccustomed to linen and calicoes strongly blued in the washing. In the\ncountry, however, high prices are paid for them by the rich mestizos,\nwho understand the real goodness of their qualities.",
        "[Bandala fabrics.] The fibers of the inner petioles, which are softer\nbut not so strong as the outer, are called tupus, and sold with\nbandala, or mixed with tapis and used in the native weaving. Bandala\nalso serves for weaving purposes; and, in that portion of the\nArchipelago where the native abacá plantations are, the entire dress\nof both sexes is made of coarse guinara. Still coarser and stronger\nfabrics are prepared for the European market, such as crinoline and\nstiff muslin used by dressmakers.",
        "[A Pre-Spanish product.] Before the arrival of the Spaniards the\nnatives wore stuffs from abacá; which became an important article of\nexport only some few decades since. This is in great measure due to\nthe enterprising spirit of two American firms, and would not have been\nattained without great perseverance and liberal pecuniary assistance.",
        "[Unbusinesslike early methods.] The plants flourish without any care\nor attention, the only trouble being to collect the fiber; and, the\nbounteousness of Nature having provided them against want, the natives\nshirk even this trouble when the market price is not very enticing. In\ngeneral low prices are scarcely to be reckoned on, because of the\nutter indifference of the laborers, over whom the traders do not\npossess enough influence to keep them at work. Advances to them are\nmade both in goods and money, which the creditor must repay either\nby produce from his own plantation or by giving an equivalent in\nlabor. [226] As long as the produce stands high in price, everything\ngoes on pretty smoothly, although even then, through the dishonesty of\nthe workers and the laziness, extravagance, and mercantile incapacity\nof the middlemen, considerable loss frequently ensues. If, however,\nprices experience any considerable fall, then the laborers seek in any\nand every way to get out of their uncomfortable position, whilst the\npercentage of profit secured to the middleman is barely sufficient\nto cover the interest on his outlay. Nevertheless, they must still\ncontinue the supplies, inasmuch as they possess no other means of\nsecuring payment of their debt in the future. The laborers, in their\nturn, bring bitter complaints against the agents, to the effect that\nthey are forced to severe labor, unprofitable to themselves, through\ntheir acceptance of advances made to them at most exorbitant rates; and\nthe agents (generally mestizos or creoles) blame the crafty, greedy,\nextortionate foreigners, who shamelessly tempt the lords of the soil\nwith false promises, and bring about their utter ruin. [Change to a\nsafer basis.] As a general rule, the “crafty foreigner” experiences\na considerable diminution of his capital. It was just so that one of\nthe most important firms suffered the loss of a very large sum. At\nlength, however, the Americans, who had capital invested in this trade,\nsucceeded in putting an end to the custom of advances, which hitherto\nhad prevailed, erected stores and presses on their own account,\nand bought through their agents direct from the growers. All earlier\nefforts tending in this direction had been effectually thwarted by\nthe Spaniards and creoles, who considered the profits derived from\nthe country, and especially the inland retail trade, to be their own\nby prescriptive right. They are particularly jealous of the foreign\nintruders, who enrich themselves at their expense; consequently they\nplace every obstacle in their way. If it depended upon the will of\nthese people, all foreigners would be ejected from the country–the\nChinese alone, as workmen (coolies), being allowed to remain. [227]",
        "[Anti-Chinese feeling.] The same feeling was exhibited by the natives\ntowards the Chinese, whom they hated for being industrious and\ntrustworthy workers. All attempts to carry out great undertakings\nby means of Chinese labor were frustrated by the native workmen\nintimidating them, and driving them away either by open violence or\nby secret persecution; and the Colonial authorities were reproached\nfor not affording suitable protection against these and similar\noutrages. That, as a rule, great undertakings did not succeed in the\nPhilippines, or at least did not yield a profit commensurate with\nthe outlay and trouble, is a fact beyond dispute, and is solely to\nbe ascribed to many of the circumstances related above. [Good work\nfor good pay.] There are those, however, who explain these mishaps\nin other ways, and insist upon the fact that the natives work well\nenough when they are punctually and sufficiently paid. The Government,\nat any rate, appears gradually to have come to the conclusion that\nthe resources of the country cannot be properly opened up without\nthe assistance of the capital and enterprise of the [Tardy justice\nto foreigners.] foreigners; and, therefore, of late years it has not\nin any way interfered with their establishment. In 1869 their right\nof establishment was tardily conceded to them by law.",
        "[Abacá production and prospects.] At this period the prospects of the\nabacá cultivation seemed very promising; and since the close of the\nAmerican war, which had the effect of causing a considerable fall in\nthe value of this article in America, the prices have been steadily\nincreasing. It is stated (on authority) that, in 1840, 136,034 piculs\nof abacá, to the value of $397,995 were exported, the value per picul\nbeing reckoned at about $2.09. The rate gradually rose and stood\nbetween four and five dollars–and, during the civil war, reached the\nenormous sum of nine dollars per picul–the export of Russian hemp\npreventing, however, a further rise. This state of affairs occasioned\nthe laying out of many new plantations, the produce of which, when\nit came on the market, after three years, was valued at $3.50 per\npicul, in consequence of the prices having returned to their normal\ncondition; and even then it paid to take up an existing plantation,\nbut not to lay out a new one. This rate continued until 1860, since\nwhich time it has gradually risen (only during the American civil\nwar was there any stoppage), and it now stands once more as high as\nduring the civil war; and there is no apparent prospect of a fall so\nlong as the Philippines have no competitors in the trade. In 1865 the\npicul in Manila never cost less than $7 which two years previously\nwas the maximum value; and it rose gradually, until $9.50 was asked\nfor ordinary qualities. The production in many provinces had reached\nthe extreme limit; and a further increase, in the former at least,\nis impossible, as the work of cultivation occupies the whole of the\nmale population–an evidence surely that a suitable recompense will\novercome any natural laziness of the natives.

        "[Sisal-hemp.] Sisal, also sisal-hemp, or, as it is sometimes known,\nMexican grass, has for some years past been used in the trade in\nincreasing quantities as a substitute for abacá, which it somewhat\nresembles in appearance, though wanting that fine gloss which the\nlatter possesses. It is somewhat weaker, and costs from £5 to £10 less\nper ton; it is only used for ships’ rigging. The refuse from it has\nbeen found an extremely useful adjunct to the materials ordinarily\nused in the manufacture of paper. The Technologist for July, 1865,\ncalls attention to the origin of this substitute, in a detailed\nessay differing essentially from the representations contained in the\n\"U. S. Agricultural Report” published at Washington in 1870; and the\ngrowing importance of the article, and the ignorance prevailing abroad\nas to its extraction, may render a short account of it acceptable. The\ndescription shows the superior fineness of the abacá fiber, but not\nits greater strength. [229]",
        "[Varieties of sisal.] Sisal-hemp, which is named after the export\nharbor of Sisal (in the north-western part of the peninsula), is by\nfar the most important product of Yucatan; and this rocky, sun-burnt\ncountry seems peculiarly adapted to the growth of the fiber. In Yucatan\nthe fiber is known as jenequem, as indeed the plant is obtained from\nit. Of the latter there are seven sorts or varieties for purposes of\ncultivation; only two, the first and seventh, are also to be found\nin a wild state. First, Chelem, apparently identical with Agave\nangustifolia; this ranks first. Second, Yaxci (pronounced Yachki;\nfrom yax, green, and tri, agave), the second in order; this is used\nonly for fine weaving. Third, Sacci (pronounced Sakki; sack, white),\nthe most important and productive, supplying almost exclusively the\nfiber for exportation; each plant yields annually twenty-five leaves,\nweighing twenty-five pounds, from which is obtained one pound of clear\nfiber. Fourth, Chucumci, similar to No. 3, but coarser. Fifth, Babci;\nthe fiber very fair, but the leaves rather small, therefore not very\nproductive. Sixth, Citamci (pronounced Kitamki; kitam, hog); neither\ngood nor productive. Seventh, Cajun or Cajum, probably Fourcroya\ncubensis; leaves small, from four to five inches long.",
        "[Machine-spinning.] The cultivation of sisal has only in recent times\nbeen prosecuted vigorously; and the extraction of the fiber from the\nleaves, and the subsequent spinning for ships’ rigging, are already\ndone by steam-machinery. This occupation is especially practiced by\nthe Maya Indians, a memorial of the Toltecs, who brought it with them\nupon their emigration from Mexico, where it was in vogue long before\nthe arrival of the Spaniards.",
        "[Profit.] The sisal cultivation yields an annual profit of 95 per\ncent. A mecate, equal to five hundred seventy-six square yards (varas),\ncontains sixty-four plants, giving sixty-four pounds of clear fiber,\nof the value of $3.84; which, after deducting $1.71, the cost of\nobtaining it, leaves $2.13 remaining. The harvesting commences from\nfour to five years after the first laying out of the plantation,\nand continues annually for about fifty or sixty years.",
        "[Banana substitute unsatisfactory.] In tropical countries there\nis scarcely a hut to be seen without banana trees surrounding it;\nand the idea presented itself to many to utilize the fiber of these\nplants, at that time entirely neglected, which might be done by the\nmere labor of obtaining it; besides which, the little labor required\nfor their proper cultivation is quickly and amply repaid by their\nabundant fruitfulness. [230]",
        "This idea, however, under the existing circumstances, would certainly\nnot be advantageous in the Philippines, as it does not pay to obtain\nbast from the genuine abacá plant as soon as it has borne fruit. The\nfiber of the edible banana might very well be used as material for\npaper-making, though obtaining it would cost more than the genuine\nbandala.",
        "[Fiber-extracting machinery.] In the Report of the Council of the\nSociety of Arts, London, May 11, 1860, attention was called to a\nmachine invented by F. Burke, of Montserrat, for obtaining fiber from\nbanana and other endogenous plants. While all the earlier machines\nworked the fiber parallelwise, this one operated obliquely on it;\nthe consequence of which was that it was turned out particularly\nclear. With this machine, from seven to nine per cent. of fibrous\nsubstance may be obtained from the banana. The Tropical Fiber Company\nhave sent these machines to Demerara, also to Java and other places,\nwith the design of spinning the fiber of the edible banana, and also\nto utilize some portions of the plant as materials in the manufacture\nof paper. Proofs have already been brought forward of fiber obtained\nin this manner in Java, the value of which to the spinner has been\nreckoned at from £20 to £25. It does not appear, however, that these\npromising experiments have led to any important results; at least,\nthe consular reports which have come to hand contain no information\non the subject. In the obtaining of bandala in the Philippines this\nmachine has not yet been used; nor has it even been seen, though the\nEnglish consul, in his latest report, complains that all the hitherto\ningeniously constructed machines have proved virtually useless.",
        "The bast of the edible banana continues still to be used in the\nPhilippines, notwithstanding that the plants, instead of being grown,\nas in many parts of America, in large well-tended gardens, are here\nscattered around the huts; but the forwarding of the raw material,\nthe local transport, and the high freightage will always render this\nmaterial too expensive for the European market (considering always its\nvery ordinary quality)–£10 per ton at the very least; while “Sparto\ngrass” (Lygaeum spartum, Loeffl.), [Paper-making materials.] which\nwas imported some few years since in considerable quantities for\nthe purpose of paper-making, costs in London only £5 per ton. [231]\nThe jute (Corchurus casularis) coffee-sacks supply another cheap paper\nmaterial. These serve in the fabrication of strong brown packing paper,\nas the fiber will not stand bleaching. According to P. Symmonds,\nthe United States in recent years have largely used bamboo. The rind\nof the Adansonia digitata also yields an extremely good material;\nin particular, paper made entirely from New Zealand flax deserves\nconsideration, being, by virtue of its superior toughness, eminently\nsuited for “bill paper.”",
        "[Preferability of discarded cloth.] It must not be overlooked that, in\nthe manufacture of paper, worn linen and cotton rags are the very best\nmaterials that can be employed, and make the best paper. Moreover,\nthey are generally to be had for the trouble of collecting them,\nafter they have once covered the cost of their production in the\nform of clothing materials; when, through being frayed by repeated\nwashings, they undergo a preparation which particularly adapts them\nto the purpose of paper-making.",
        "[Increasing use of wood and straw.] The more paper-making progresses,\nthe more are ligneous fibers brought forward, particularly wood and\nstraw, which produce really good pastes; all the raw materials being\nimported from a distance. That England takes so much sparto is easily\nexplained by the fact that she has very little straw of her own,\nfor most of the grain consumed by her is received from abroad in a\ngranulated condition.",
        "[Tobacco revenue.] Of all the productions of the country tobacco is\nthe most important, so far (at least) as concerns the Government,\nwhich have the cultivation of this plant, its manipulation, and sale,\nthe subjects of an extensive and strictly guarded monopoly, and derives\na very considerable portion of the public revenue therefrom. [232]\nAs to the objections raised against this revenue on the score of its\nbeing opposed to justice and morality, many other sources of revenue in\nthe colonial budget might be condemned (such as the poll-tax, gaming\nand opium licenses, the brandy trade, and the sale of indulgences);\nyet none is so invidious and pernicious as the tobacco monopoly.",
        "[Injustice of the monopoly.] Often in the course of this narrative\nof my travels I have had occasion to commend the clemency of the\nSpanish Government. In glaring contrast therewith, however, stands the\nmanagement of the tobacco regulations. They appropriated the fields of\nthe peasantry without the slightest indemnification–fields which had\nbeen brought under cultivation for their necessary means of sustenance;\nforced them, under penalty of bodily punishment, to raise, on the\nconfiscated property, an article which required an immense amount\nof trouble and attention, and which yielded a very uncertain crop;\nand they then valued the harvested leaves arbitrarily and without any\nappeal, and, in the most favorable case, paid for them at a nominal\nprice fixed by themselves. To be paid at all, indeed, appears to have\nbeen a favor, for it has not been done in full now for several years in\nsuccession. Spain regularly remains indebted to the unlucky peasants\nin the amount of the miserable pittance allowed, from one year’s end\nto another. The Government ordered the officials to exact a higher\nreturn from the impoverished population of the tobacco districts; and\neven rewarded informers who, after pointing out fields already owned,\nbut which were considered suitable to the cultivation of tobacco,\nwere installed into possession of the proclaimed lands in the place\nof the original owners.",
        "For proofs of these accusations, one need only peruse a few paragraphs\ncontained in the following stringent regulations, entitled “General\nInstructions,” [233] and, further, a few extracts from the official\ndispatches of Intendant-General Agius to the Colonial Minister:– [234]",
        "[Résumé of regulations] Cap. 25, § 329. The compulsory system of\ncultivation in Cagayan, New Vizcaya, Gapan, Igorots, and Abra to\nremain in force.",
        "§ 331. The Director-General of the Government is authorized to\nextend compulsory labor to the other provinces, or to abolish it\nwhere already introduced. These instructions may be altered wholly\nor in part as occasion requires.",
        "§ 332. Prices may be either increased or lowered.",
        "§ 337. Claims or actions concerning the possession of tobacco\nlands pending before the usual tribunal shall not prevent such\nlands from being used for the purposes of tobacco cultivation, the\npresent proprietor being under strict obligation to continue the\ncultivation either in person or by substitute. (If he omits to do so,\nthe magistrate or judge takes upon himself to appoint such substitute.)",
        "§ 351. The collectors have received denuncies, i.e. information,\nthat land adapted to tobacco growing is lying fallow, and that it is\nprivate property. In case such land is really suitable to the purposes\nof tobacco cultivation, the owners thereof are hereby summoned to\ncultivate the same with tobacco in preference to anything else. At\nthe expiration of a certain space of time the land in question\nis to be handed over to the informer. Be it known, however, that,\nnotwithstanding these enactments, the possessory title is not lost to\nthe owner, but he is compelled to relinquish all rights and usufruct\nfor three years.",
        "Cap. 27, § 357. An important duty of the collector is to insure the\ngreatest possible extension of the tobacco cultivation upon all\nsuitable lands, but in particular upon those which are specially\nconvenient and fertile. Lands which, although suitable for tobacco\ngrowing, were previously planted with rice or corn, shall, as far\nas practicable, be replaced by forest clearings, in order, as far as\npossible, to prevent famine and to bring the interests of the natives\ninto harmony with those of the authorities.",
        "§ 351. In order that the work which the tobacco cultivation requires\nmay not be neglected by the natives, and that they may perform the\nfield work necessary for their sustenance, it is ordered that every\ntwo persons working together shall, between them cultivate eight\nthousand square varas, that is, two and one-half acres of tobacco land.",
        "§ 362. Should this arrangement fail to be carried out either through\nage, sickness, or death, it shall be left to the priest of the district\nto determine what quantity of work can be accomplished by the little\nchildren, having regard to their strength and number.",
        "§ 369. Every collector who consigns from his district 1,000 fardos\nmore than in former years, shall receive for the overplus a double\ngratuity, but this only where the proportion of first-class leaves\nhas not decreased.",
        "§ 370. The same gratuity will be bestowed when there is no diminution\nin bulk, and one-third of the leaves is of first-class quality.",
        "The following sections regulate the action of the local authorities:–",
        "§ 379. Every governor must present annually a list, revised by the\npriest of the district, of all the inhabitants in his district of both\nsexes, and of those of their children who are old enough to help in\nthe fields.",
        "§ 430. The officers shall forward the emigrants on to Cagayan and\nNueva Vizcaya, and will be entrusted with $5 for that purpose, which\nmust be repaid by each individual, as they cannot be allowed to remain\nindebted in their province.",
        "§ 436. Further it is ordered by the Buen Gobierno (good government)\nthat no Filipino shall be liable for a sum exceeding $5, incurred\neither as a loan or a simple debt. Thus the claim of a higher sum\ncan not impede emigration.",
        "§ 437. The Hacienda (Public Treasury) shall pay the passage money\nand the cost of maintenance from Ilocos.",
        "§ 438. They are to be provided with the means of procuring cattle,\ntools, etc., until the first harvest (although the Indian is only\nliable for $5).",
        "§ 439. Such advances are, it is true, personal and individual; but,\nin the case of death or flight of the debtor, the whole village is\nto be liable for the amount due.",
        "[Tobacco from Mexico.] Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum, L.) was introduced\ninto the Philippines soon after the arrival of the Spaniards by the\nmissionaries, who brought the seed with them from Mexico. [235] The\nsoil and climate being favorable to its production, and the pleasure\nderived from it being speedily discovered by the natives, naturally\nassisted in its rapid adoption. Next to the Cuban tobacco and a\nfew sorts of Turkish [236]it is admitted to be the best; and in the\ncolony it is asserted by competent judges that it would soon surpass\nall others, if the existing regulations were abolished and free trade\nestablished. There can be no doubt in the minds of impartial observers\nthat the quality and quantity of the produce might be considerably\nincreased by such a change; on the other hand, many of the prejudiced\nofficials certainly maintain the direct contrary. The real question is,\nto what extent these expectations may be realized in the fulfilment of\nsuch a measure; of course, bearing in mind that the judgment is swayed\nby a strong desire for the abolition of a system which interferes at\npresent with their prospects of gain. But the fact is that, even now,\nthe native grown tobacco, notwithstanding all the defects inseparable\nfrom an illicit trade, is equal to that produced by the [High grade\nof Philippine product.] Government officials in their own factories,\nand is valued at the same rate with many of the Havana brands; and\nthe Government cigars of the Philippines are preferred to all others\nthroughout Eastern Asia. Indeed, rich merchants, to whom a difference\nof price is no object, as a rule take the Manila cigars before Havanas.",
        "[Manila tobacco handicapped.] According to Agius (\"Memoria,” 1871), in\nthe European market the Manila tobacco was admitted to be without any\nrival, with the sole exception of the Vuelta abajo of Cuba; and most\ncertainly in the Asiatic and Oceanic ports its superior quality was\nundisputed, as the Havana tobacco loses its flavor on the long voyage\nto these countries; but now, from year to year, it is surely losing its\nreputation. If, then, the Manila cigars have not hitherto succeeded in\nmaking themselves acceptable in Europe on account of their inferiority,\nthe blame is attributable simply to the system of compulsory labor,\nand the chronic insolvency of the Insular Treasury, whilst the produce\nof other tobacco countries has steadily progressed in quality in\nconsequence of free competition. The fame of the Manila cigars may\nalso have suffered in some slight measure from the wide-spread,\nthough perfectly erroneous, idea that they contained opium.",
        "[Hampered by government restrictions.] How greatly the produce might be\nincreased by means of free trade is shown under other circumstances by\nthe example of Cuba. At the time when the Government there monopolized\nthe tobacco trade, the crops were only partly sufficient to cover\nthe home consumption; whereas, at the present time, Cuba supplies\nall the markets of the world. [237] The decision of Captain-General\nDe la Gandara upon this question is in the highest degree worthy\nof notice. In a MS. Report to the Colonial Minister, March, 1858,\nconcerning a measure for rendering the regulations of the tobacco\nmonopoly still more stringent, he says: “If the tobacco cultivation\nis placed without restriction into the hands of private traders,\nwe shall most probably, in a few years, be in a position to command\nnearly all the markets in the world.” Most of the islands produce\ntobacco. According to the quality of the produce, the tobacco\nprovinces rank in the following order: First, Cagayan and Isabela;\nSecond, Igorots; Third, Island of Mindanao; Fourth, Bisayas; Fifth,\nNueva Ecija.",
        "[Origin of monopoly.] From the Government Order, dated November 20,\n1625, it is evident that even at that early period the sale of betel\nnut, palm spirit (toddy), tobacco, etc., was a Government monopoly: but\nit does not seem to have been very strictly carried out. The tobacco\nmonopoly, as it stands at present, the whole trade of which from the\nsowing of the seedling plants to the sale of the manufactured article\nis exclusively in the hands of the Government, was first introduced by\nCaptain-General José Basco y Vargas. And a Government Order, under date\nof January 9, 1780 (confirmed by Departmental Regulations, December\n13, 1781), further enacted that the tobacco regulations should be\nextended to the Philippine Islands, in like manner as in all Spanish\npossessions in this and the other hemisphere (de uno y otto mundo).",
        "[Governor Basco’s innovations.] Before the administration of this\nvery jealous Governor, for a period of two hundred years the colony\nreceived annual contributions from New Spain (Situado de Nueva\nEspaña). In order to relieve the Spanish Exchequer, from this charge\nBasco introduced (at that time national economic ideas prevailed of\nmaking the natural resources of a State supply its immediate wants)\na plan upon which, fifty years later, Java modelled its “Culture\nSystem.” In the Philippines, however, the conditions for this system\nwere less favorable. In addition to the very slight submissiveness\nof the population, there were two great obstacles in the opposition\nof the priests and the want of trustworthy officials. Of all the\nprovincial trades brought into existence by the energy of Basco, the\nindigo cultivation is the only one that remains in the hands of private\nindividuals, the tobacco trade still being a Government monopoly. [238]\nBasco first of all confined the monopoly to the provinces immediately\ncontiguous to the capital, in all of which the cultivation of tobacco\nwas forbidden under penalty of severe punishment, except by persons\nduly authorized and in the service of the Government. [239] In the\nother provinces the cultivation was to a certain extent permitted;\nbut the supply remaining after deduction of what was consumed in each\nprovince was to be sold to the Government only.",
        "[Speculation with public funds.] In the Bisayas the magistrates\npurchased the tobacco for the Government and paid for it at the rate\npreviously fixed by the Government factories at Manila; and they\nwere allowed to employ the surplus money of the Government treasury\nchest for this purpose. A worse system than this could scarcely be\ndevised. Officials, thinking only of their own private advantage,\nsuffered no competition in their provinces, employed their official\npower to oppress the producer to the utmost extent, and thereby\nnaturally checked the production; and the Government treasury chest\nconsequently suffered frequent losses through bankruptcies, inasmuch\nas the magistrates, who drew a salary of $600 and paid a license\nof from $100 to $300 for the right of trading, in order to make\nmoney quickly, engaged in the most hazardous speculations. In 1814\nthis stupid arrangement was first put an end to; and forthwith the\ntobacco supplies from the Bisayas increased, through the competition\nof the private dealers, who then, for the first time, had the power of\npurchase; and from 1839 the planters were empowered to obtain higher\nprices than those afforded by the greedy monopolizing magistrates. At\npresent, the following general regulations are in force, subject,\nhowever, to continual variation in details.",
        "[Changes bring improvement.] By a Departmental Order, September 5,\n1865, the cultivation of tobacco was permitted in all the provinces,\nthough the produce was allowed to be sold only to the Government at\nthe price regulated by them. The wholesale purchases are made in Luzon\nand the adjacent islands in fardos, [240] by “colleccion,” that is,\ndirect through the finance officials, who have the management of\nthe plants from the sowing; but in the Bisayas by acopio; that is,\nthe Government officials buy up the tobacco tendered by the growers\nor speculators by the cwt.",
        "[Different usages in Bisayas and Mindanao.] In the Bisayas and in\nMindanao everybody is allowed to manufacture cigars for his own\nparticular use, though trade therein is strictly prohibited; and\nadvances to the tobacco growers are also made there; while in Luzon\nand the neighboring islands the Government provides seed and seedling\nplants. Here, however, no land which is adapted to the cultivation\nof tobacco is allowed to be used for any other purpose of agriculture.",
        "[Crude system of grading.] As the Financial Administration is\nunable to classify the tobacco at its true value, as might be done\nwere free competition permitted, they have adopted the expedient of\ndetermining the price by the size of the leaves; the care necessary\nto be bestowed upon the training of the plants in order to produce\nleaves of the required size being at least a guarantee of a certain\namount of proper attention and handling, even if it be productive of\nno other direct good. [241]",
        "[Burden knowingly increased.] It is well known at Madrid how the\ntobacco monopoly, by oppressing the wretched population, interferes\nwith the prosperity of the colony; yet, to the present day, the\nGovernment measures have been so arranged as to exact a still larger\ngain from this very impolitic source of revenue.",
        "[\"Killing the goose that lays the golden egg.\"] A Government Order of\nJanuary, 1866, directed the tobacco cultivation in the Philippines to\nbe extended as much as possible, in order to satisfy the requirements\nof the colony, the mother country, and also the export trade;\nand in the memorial already quoted, “reforms” are proposed by the\nCaptain-General, in the spirit of the goose with golden eggs. By\ngrafting new monopolies upon those already existing, he believes that\nthe tobacco produce can be increased from 182,102 cwt. (average of\nthe years 1860 to 1857) to 500,000, and even 800,000 cwt. Meantime,\nwith a view to obtaining increased prices, the Government resolved\nto export the tobacco themselves to the usual markets for sale; and\nin the year 1868 this resolution was really carried out. It was sent\nto London, where it secured so favorable a market that it was at once\ndecreed that no tobacco in Manila should thenceforth be sold at less\nthan $25 per cwt. [242] This decree, however, referred only to the\nfirst three qualities, the quantity of which decreased in a relative\nmeasure with the increased pressure upon the population. Even in\nthe table annexed to the record of La Gandara this is very clearly\nshown. Whilst the total produce for 1867 stood at 176,018 cwt. (not\nmuch under the average of the years 1860 to 1857, viz., 182,102 cwt.),\nthe tobacco of the first class had decreased in quantity since 1862\nfrom over 13,000 to less than 5,000 cwt.",
        "[Gift to Spain of unusable tobacco.] The fourth, fifth, and sixth\nclasses, the greater part of which would before have been burnt, but\nwhich now form no inconsiderable portion of the total crop, are in the\nopen markets positively unsaleable, and can be utilized only in the\nform of a bonus to Spain, which annually receives, under the title of\natenciones á la peninsula, upwards of 100,000 cwt. If the colony were\nnot compelled to pay half the freight of these gifts, Spain would\ncertainly ask to be relieved of these “marks of attention.” Seeing\nthat, according to the decision of the chief of the Government, the\ngreater portion of this tobacco is of such inferior quality that it\ncan find no purchaser at any price, it is impossible that its value\nshould cover either the cost of carriage or the customs duty. Moreover,\nthis tobacco tribute is a great burden on the colonial budget; which,\nin spite of all deficits, is charged with the expenses attending the\ncollection of the tobacco, its packing, its cost of local transport,\nand half the expense of its carriage to Europe.",
        "[De La Gandara’s proposed reforms.] Dated in March, 1871,–the\nbeginning of a Golden Age, if De La Gandara’s plans had been carried\nout and his expectations realized,–there exists an excellent\nstatement from the Intendant-General addressed to the Minister of\nColonies pointing out plainly to the chief of the Government the\ndisadvantages arising from this mode of administration, and urging the\nimmediate repeal of the monopoly. In the next place proof was adduced,\nsupported by official vouchers, that the profits derived from the\ntobacco monopoly were much smaller than usual. The total average\nreceipts of the tobacco administration for the five years 1855 to\n1869, according to official accounts, amounted to $5,367,262; for the\nyears 1866 to 1870, only $5,240,935. The expenses cannot be accurately\nestimated, inasmuch as there are no strict accounts obtainable; if,\nhowever, the respective expenses charged in the colonial budget are\nadded together, they amount to $3,717,322 of which $1,812,250 is for\npurchase of raw tobacco.",
        "[Slight real profit from monopoly.] Besides these expenses pertaining\nexclusively to the tobacco administration there are still many other\ndifferent items to be taken into account; yet the cost incurred in\nthis branch of the service would be saved, if not altogether, at\nleast largely, if the State surrendered the tobacco monopoly. The\ntotal of the disbursements must certainly, at the very lowest, be\nestimated at $4,000,000; so, therefore, the State receives only a net\nprofit of $1,357,000; but even this is not to be reckoned on in the\nfuture, for if the Government does not speedily cease carrying on this\ntrade, they will be forced into a very considerable and unavoidable\nexpense. To begin with, they must erect new factories and warehouses;\nbetter machinery must be bought; wages will have to be considerably\nincreased; and, above all, means must be devised to pay off the\nenormous sum of $1,600,000 in which the Government is indebted to the\npeasants for the crops of 1869 and 1870, and to assure cash payments\nfor future harvests. “This is the only possible mode of preventing\nthe decay of the tobacco cultivation in the different provinces,\nas well as relieving the misery of the wretched inhabitants.”",
        "[Suffering and law-breaking thru the monopoly.] Later Agius proved\nhow trifling in reality the arrears were on account of which the\nGovernment was abandoning the future of the colony, and showed the\nmisfortunes, of which I shall mention, these briefly, only a few,\nresulting from the monopoly. He represented that the people of the\ntobacco district, who were the richest and most contented of all in the\nArchipelago, found themselves plunged into the deepest distress after\nthe increase of the Government dues. They were, in fact, far more\ncruelly treated than the slaves in Cuba, who, from self-interested\nmotives, are well-nourished and taken care of; whereas in this case,\nthe produce of compulsory labor has to be delivered to the State at an\narbitrarily determined price; and even this price is paid only when\nthe condition of the treasury, which is invariably in difficulties,\npermits. Frequently their very means of subsistence failed them,\nin consequence of their being forbidden to carry on the cultivation;\nand the unfortunate people, having no other resources for the relief\nof their pressing necessities, were compelled to alienate the debtor’s\nbond, which purchased the fruits of their enforced toil but had been\nleft unpaid. Thus, for an inconsiderable deficit of about $1,330,000,\nthe whole population of one of the richest provinces is thrown into\nabject misery; a deep-rooted hatred naturally arises between the people\nand their rulers; and incessant war ensues between the authorities\nand their subjects. Besides which, an extremely dangerous class of\nsmugglers have recently arisen, who even now do not confine themselves\nto mere smuggling, but who, on the very first opportunity presented by\nthe prevailing discontent, will band themselves together in one solid\nbody. The official administrators, too, are charged with gross bribery\nand corruption; which, whether true or not, occasions great scandal,\nand engenders increasing disrespect and distrust of the colonial\nadministration as well as of the Spanish people generally. [243]",
        "[Growing opposition to the monopoly.] The preceding memorial has\nbeen not only written, but also printed; and it seems to indicate\nthat gradually in Spain, and also in wider circles, people are\nbecoming convinced of the untenableness of the tobacco monopoly;\nyet, in spite of this powerful review, it is considered doubtful by\ncompetent judges whether it will be given up so long as there are any\napparent or appreciable returns derived therefrom. These acknowledged\nevils have long been known to the Colonial Government; but, from\nthe frequent changes of ministers, and the increasing want of money,\nthe Government is compelled, so long as they are in office, to use\nall possible means of obtaining profits, and to abstain from carrying\nout these urgent reforms lest their own immediate downfall should be\ninvolved therein. Let us, however, cherish the hope that increased\ndemand will cause a rise in the prices; a few particularly good crops,\nand other propitious circumstances, would relieve at once the Insular\nTreasury from its difficulties; and then the tobacco monopoly might be\ncheerfully surrendered. One circumstance favorable to the economical\nmanagement of the State that would be produced by the surrender of\nthe tobacco monopoly would be the abolition of the numerous army of\nofficials which its administration requires. This might, however,\noperate reversely in Spain. The number of place-hunters created\nmust be very welcome to the ministers in power, who thus have the\nopportunity of providing their creatures with profitable places,\nor of shipping off inconvenient persons to the Antipodes from the\nmother-country, free of cost. The colony, be it known, has not only\nto pay the salaries, but also to bear the cost of their outward and\nhomeward voyages. Any way, the custom is so liberally patronized that\noccasionally new places have to be created in order to make room for\nthe newly-arrived nominees. [244]",
        "[Wholesale rate highter than retail government.] At the time of\nmy visit, the royal factories could not turn out a supply of cigars\ncommensurate with the requirements of commerce; and this brought about\na peculiar condition of things; the wholesale dealer, who purchased\ncigars in very considerable quantities at the government auctions,\npaying higher than the retail rates at which he could buy them\nsingly in the estancia. In order, therefore, to prevent the merchants\ndrawing their stocks from the estancias, it was determined that only\na certain quantity should be purchased, which limit no merchant dared\nexceed. A very intricate system of control, assisted by espionage,\nhad to be employed in seeing that no one, through different agents and\ndifferent estancias, collected more than the authorised supply; and\nviolation of this rule, when discovered, was punished by confiscation\nof the offender’s stock. Everybody was free to purchase cigars in the\nestancia, but nobody was permitted to sell a chest of cigars to an\nacquaintance at cost price. Several Spaniards with whom I have spoken\nconcerning these strange regulations maintained them to be perfectly\njust, as otherwise all the cigars would be carried off by foreigners,\nand they would not be able themselves in their own colony to smoke\na decent cigar.",
        "[Money juggling.] There was, as I afterwards learnt, a still more\nurgent reason for the existence of these decrees. The government\nvalued their own gold at sixteen dollars per ounce, while in commerce\nit fetched less, and the premium on silver had, at one time, risen\nto thirty-three per cent. Moreover, on account of the insufficient\nquantity of copper money for minor currency, the small change\nfrequently gained a premium on the silver dollar, so much so that by\nevery purchaser not less than half a dollar was realized. In exchanging\nthe dollar from five to fifteen per cent discount was charged; it was\nprofitable, therefore, to purchase cigars in the estancias with the\ngold ounce, and then to retail them in smaller quantities nominally\nat the rate of the estancias. Both premiums together might in an\nextreme case amount to as much as forty-three per cent. [245]",
        "[Directions for cultivating tobacco] Not being able to give a\ndescription of the cultivation of tobacco from personal knowledge\nand experience, I refer the reader to the following short extract\nfrom the Cartilla Agricola:–",
        "Directions for preparing and laying out the seed beds.–A suitable\npiece of land is to be enclosed quadrilaterally by boundaries,\nploughed two or three times, cleared of all weeds and roots, made\nsomewhat sloping, and surrounded by a shallow ditch, the bed of\nwhich is to be divided by drains about two feet wide. The soil of\nthe same must be very fine, must be ground almost as fine as powder,\notherwise it will not mix freely and thoroughly with the extremely\nfine tobacco seed. The seed is to be washed, and then suspended in\ncloths during the day, in order to allow the water to run off; after\nwhich it is to be mixed with a similar quantity of ashes, and strewn\ncarefully over the bed. The subsequent successful results depend\nentirely upon the careful performance of this work. From the time\nthe seed first begins to sprout, the beds must be kept very clean, in\ndry weather sprinkled daily, and protected from birds and animals by\nbrambles strewn over, and by means of light mats from storms and heavy\nrains. After two months the plants will be between five and six inches\nhigh, and generally have from four to six leaves; they must then be\nreplanted. This occurs, supposing the seed-beds to have been prepared\nin September, about the beginning or the middle of November. A second\nsowing takes place on the 15th of October, as much as a precaution\nagainst possible failure, as for obtaining plants for the lowlands.",
        "Concerning the land most advantageous to the tobacco and its\ncultivation. Replanting of the seedlings.–Land must be chosen of\nmiddling grain; somewhat difficult, calciferous soil is particularly\nrecommended, when it is richly fertilized with the remains of\ndecayed plants, and not less than two feet deep; and the deeper the\nroots are inserted the higher will the plant grow. Of all the land\nadapted to the tobacco cultivation, that in Cagayan is the best,\nas from the overflowing of the large streams, which occurs every\nyear, it is laid under water, and annually receives a new stratum\nof mud, which renders the soil particularly productive. Plantations\nprepared upon such soil differ very materially from those less\nfavored and situated on a higher level. In the former the plants\nshoot up quickly as soon as the roots strike; in the latter they\ngrow slowly and only reach a middling height. Again in the fertile\nsoil the plants produce quantities of large, strong, juicy leaves,\ngiving promise of a splendid harvest. In the other case the plants\nremain considerably smaller and grow sparsely. Sometimes, however,\neven the lowlands are flooded in January and February, and also in\nMarch, when the tobacco has already been transplanted, and grown to\nsome little height. In that event everything is irreparably lost,\nparticularly if the flood should occur at a time when it is too late\nto lay out new plantations. High-lying land also must, therefore, be\ncultivated, in the hope that by very careful attention it may yield\na similar return. In October these fields must be ploughed three or\nfour times, and harrowed twice or thrice. On account of the floods,\nthe lowlands cannot be ploughed until the end of December, or the\nmiddle of January; when the work is light and simple. The strongest\nplants in the seed-beds are chosen, and set in the prepared grounds\nat a distance of three feet from each other, care being taken that\nthe earth clinging to the roots is not shaken off.",
        "Of the care necessary to be bestowed upon the plants.–In the east a\nlittle screen, formed by two clods, is to be erected, with a view to\nprotecting the plant from the morning sun, and retaining the dew for\na longer time. The weeds to be carefully exterminated, and the wild\nshoots removed. A grub which occasionally appears in great numbers is\nparticularly dangerous. Rain is very injurious immediately before the\nripening, when the plants are no longer in a condition to secrete the\ngummy substance so essential to the tobacco, which, being soluble in\nwater, would be drawn off by the action of the rain. Tobacco which has\nbeen exposed to bad weather is always deficient in juice and flavor,\nand is full of white spots, a certain sign of its bad quality. The\ninjury is all the greater the nearer the tobacco is to its ripening\nperiod; the leaves hanging down to the ground then decay, and must\nbe removed. If the subsoil is not deep enough, a carefully tended\nplant will turn yellow, and nearly wither away. In wet seasons this\ndoes not occur so generally, as the roots in insufficient depth are\nenabled to find enough moisture.",
        "Cutting and manipulation of the leaves in the drying shed.–The\ntopmost leaves ripen first; they are then of a dark yellow color, and\ninflexible. They must be cut off as they ripen, collected into bundles,\nand brought to the shed in covered carts. In wet or cloudy weather,\nwhen the nightly dews have not been thoroughly evaporated by the sun,\nthey must not be cut. In the shed the leaves are to hang upon cords or\nsplit Spanish cane, with sufficient room between them for ventilation\nand drying. The dried leaves are then laid in piles, which must not\nbe too big, and frequently turned over. Extreme care must be taken\nthat they do not become overheated and ferment too strongly. This\noperation, which is of the utmost importance to the quality of the\ntobacco, demands great attention and skill, and must be continued\nuntil nothing but an aromatic smell of tobacco can be noticed coming\nfrom the leaves; but the necessary skill for this manipulation is only\nto be acquired by long practice, and not from any written instructions.",
        "[Importance of Chinese.] An important portion of the population\nremains to be discussed, viz. the Chinese, who are destined to play a\nremarkable part, inasmuch as the development of the land-cultivation\ndemanded by the increasing trade and commercial intercourse can be\naffected only by Chinese industry and perseverance. Manila has always\nbeen a favorite place for Chinese immigrants; and neither the hostility\nof the people, nor oppressing and prohibitory decrees for a long time\nby the Government, not even the repeated massacres, have been able\nto prevent their coming. The position of the Islands, south-east of\ntwo of the most important of the Chinese provinces, must necessarily\nhave brought about a trade between the two countries very early, as\nships can make the voyage in either direction with a moderate wind,\nas well in the south-west as the north-east monsoon. [Early Chinese\nAssociations.] In a few old writers may even be found the assertion\nthat the Philippine Islands were at one time subject to the dominion of\nChina; and Father Gaubil (Lettres Edifiantes) mentions that Jaung-lo\n(of the Ming dynasty) maintained a fleet consisting of 30,000 men,\nwhich at different times proceeded to Manila. The presence of their\nships as early as the arrival of Magellan in the extreme east\nof the archipelago, as well as the China plates and earthenware\nvessels discovered in the excavations, plainly show that the trade\nwith China had extended far earlier to the most distant islands of\nthe archipelago. It formed the chief support of the young Spanish\ncolony, and, after the rise of the Encomiendas, was nearly the only\nsource of its prosperity. It was feared that the junks would offer\ntheir cargoes to the Dutch if any obstacle was put in the way of\ntheir coming to Manila. The colony certainly could not maintain its\nposition without the “Sangleys,” [246] who came annually in great\nnumbers in the junks from China, and spread all over the country and\nin the towns as [Industrial and commercial activity.] shopkeepers,\nartisans, gardeners, and fishermen; besides which, they were the\nonly skillful and industrious workers, as the Filipinos under the\npriestly domination had forgotten altogether many trades in which\nthey had engaged in former times. I take these facts from Morga.",
        "[Unsuccessful attempts at restriction.] In spite of all this, the\nSpaniards have, from the very commencement, endeavored rigorously to\nlimit the number of the Chinese; who were then, as they are now, envied\nand hated by the natives for their industry, frugality, and cunning, by\nwhich means they soon became rich. They were an abomination, moreover,\nin the eyes of the priests as being irreclaimable heathens, whose\nexample prevented the natives from making progress in the direction\nof Christianity; and the government feared them on account of the\nstrong bond of union existing between them, and as being subjects of\nso powerful a nation, whose close proximity threatened the small body\nof Spaniards with destruction. [247] Fortunately for the latter, the\nMing dynasty, which at that time was hastening to its downfall, did\nnot think of conquest; but wickedly disposed powers which sprang into\nexistence upon their downfall brought the colony into extreme danger.",
        "[Limahong and the Mandarins’ visit.] In the attack of the noted pirate,\nLimahong, in 1574, they escaped destruction only by a miracle; and\nsoon new dangers threatened them afresh. In 1603 a few mandarins came\nto Manila, under the pretence of ascertaining whether the ground\nabout Cavite was really of gold. They were supposed to be spies,\nand it was concluded, from their peculiar mission, that an attack\nupon the colony was intended by the Chinese.",
        "[Early massacre of Chinese.] The archbishop and the priests incited\nthe distrust which was felt against the numerous Chinese who were\nsettled in Manila. Mutual hate and suspicion arose; both parties feared\none another and prepared for hostilities. The Chinese commenced the\nattack; but the united forces of the Spaniards, being supported by\nthe Japanese and the Filipinos, twenty-three thousand, according\nto other reports twenty-five thousand, of the Chinese were either\nkilled or driven into the desert. When the news of this massacre\nreached China, a letter from the Royal Commissioners was sent to the\nGovernor of Manila. That noteworthy document shows in so striking a\nmanner how hollow the great government was at that time that I have\ngiven a literal translation of it at the end of this chapter.",
        "[Chinese laborers limited.] After the extermination of the Chinese,\nfood and all Chinese other necessaries of life were difficult to\nobtain on account of the utter unreliability of the natives for work;\nbut by 1605 the number of Chinese [248] had again so increased that\na decree was issued limiting them to six thousand, “these to be\nemployed in the cultivation of the country;” while at the same time\ntheir rapid increase was taken advantage of by the captain-general\nfor his own interest, as he exacted eight dollars from each Chinaman\nfor permission to remain. In 1539 the Chinese population had risen to\nthirty thousand, according to other information, to forty thousand,\nwhen they revolted and were reduced to seven thousand. “The natives,\nwho generally were so listless and indifferent, showed the utmost\neagerness in assisting in the [Another massacre.] massacre of the\nChinese, but more from hatred of this industrious people than from\nany feeling of friendship towards the Spaniards.” [249]",
        "[The pirate Kog-seng.] The void occasioned by this massacre was\nsoon filled up again by Chinese immigrants; and in 1662 the colony\nwas once more menaced with a new and great danger, by the Chinese\npirate Kog-seng, who had under his command between eighty and one\nhundred thousand men, and who already had dispossessed the Dutch\nof the Island of Formosa. He demanded the absolute submission of\nthe Philippines; his sudden death, however, saved the colony, and\noccasioned a fresh outbreak of fury against the Chinese settlers in\nManila, a great number of whom were butchered in their own “quarter\"\n(ghetto). [250] Some dispersed and hid themselves; a few in their\nterror plunged into the water or hanged themselves; and a great number\nfled in small boats to Formosa. [251]",
        "[Another expulsion.] In 1709 the jealousy against the Chinese once\nmore had reached such a height that they were accused of rebellion,\nand particularly of monopolizing the trades, and, with the exception\nof the most serviceable of the artisans and such of them as were\nemployed by the Government, they were once again expelled. Spanish\nwriters praise the salutariness of these measures; alleging that\n\"under the pretence of agriculture the Chinese carry on trade; they\nare cunning and careful, making money and sending it to China, so that\nthey defraud the Philippines annually of an enormous amount.” Sonnerat,\nhowever, complains that art, trade, and commerce had not recovered\nfrom these severe blows; though, he adds, fortunately the Chinese,\nin spite of prohibitory decrees, are returning through the corrupt\nconnivance of the governor and officials.",
        "[Thrifty traders.] To the present day they are blamed as being\nmonopolists, particularly by the creoles; and certainly, by means\nof their steady industry and natural commercial aptitude, they\nhave appropriated nearly all the retail trade to themselves. The\nsale of European imported goods is entirely in their hands; and the\nwholesale purchase of the produce of the country for export is divided\nbetween the natives, creoles, and the Chinese, the latter taking about\none-half. Before this time only the natives and creoles were permitted\nto own ships for the purpose of forwarding the produce to Manila.",
        "In 1757 the jealousy of the Spaniards broke out again in the form\nof a new order from Madrid, directing the expulsion of the Chinese;\nand in 1759 the decrees of banishment, which were repeatedly evaded,\nwere carried into effect: but, as the private interests of the\nofficials did not happen to coincide with those of the creole traders,\nthe consequence was that “the Chinese soon streamed back again in\nincredible numbers,” and made common cause with the English upon\ntheir invasion in 1762. [252] [Anda’s and 1819 massacres.] Thereupon,\nSr. Anda commanded “that all the Chinese in the Philippine Islands\nshould be hanged,” which order was very generally carried out. [253]\nThe last great Chinese massacre took place in 1819, when the aliens\nwere suspected of having brought about the cholera by poisoning\nthe wells. The greater part of the Europeans in Manila also fell\nvictims to the fury of the populace, but the Spaniards generally were\nspared. The prejudice of the Spaniards, especially of the creoles,\nhad always been directed against the Chinese tradesmen, who interfered\nunpleasantly with the fleecing of the natives; and against this class\nin particular were the laws of limitation aimed. They would willingly\nhave let them develop the country by farming but the hostility of\nthe natives generally prevented this.",
        "[Expulsion of merchants from Manila.] A decree, issued in 1804,\ncommanded all Chinese shopkeepers to leave Manila within eight days,\nonly those who were married being allowed to keep shops; and their\nresidence in the provinces was permitted only upon the condition\nthat they confined themselves entirely to agriculture. Magistrates\nwho allowed these to travel in their districts were fined $200; the\ndeputy-governor $25; and the wretched Chinese were punished with from\ntwo to three years’ confinement in irons.",
        "In 1839 the penalties against the Chinese were somewhat mitigated,\nbut those against the magistrates were still maintained on account\nof their venality. In 1843 Chinese ships were placed upon terms of\nequality with those of other foreign countries (Leg. Ult., II.,\n476). In 1850 Captain-General Urbiztondo endeavored to introduce\nChinese colonial farming, and with this object promised a reduction\nof the taxes to all agricultural immigrants. Many Chinese availed\nthemselves of this opportunity in order to escape the heavy poll-tax;\nbut in general they soon betook themselves to trading once more.",
        "[Oppressive taxation.] Of late years the Chinese have not suffered\nfrom the terrible massacres which used formerly to overtake them;\nneither have they suffered banishment; the officials being content to\nsuppress their activity by means of heavy and oppressive taxes. For\ninstance, at the end of 1867 the Chinese shopkeepers were annually\ntaxed $50 for permission to send their goods to the weekly market;\nthis was in addition to a tax of from $12 to $100 on their occupations;\nand at the same time they were commanded thenceforth to keep their\nbooks in Spanish (English Consular Report, 1859).",
        "[Excellent element in population.] The Chinese remain true to their\ncustoms and mode of living in the Philippines, as they do everywhere\nelse. When they outwardly embrace Christianity, it is done merely to\nfacilitate marriage, or from some motive conducive to their worldly\nadvantage; and occasionally they renounce it, together with their\nwives in Manila, when about to return home to China. Very many of\nthem, however, beget families, are excellent householders, and their\nchildren in time form the most enterprising, industrious, and wealthy\nportion of the resident population.",
        "[Formidable competitors.] Invigorated by the severe struggle for\nexistence which they have experienced in their over-populated\ncountry, the Chinese appear to preserve their capacity for labor\nperfectly unimpaired by any climate. No nation can equal them in\ncontentedness, industry, perseverance, cunning, skill, and adroitness\nin trades and mercantile matters. When once they gain a footing, they\ngenerally appropriate the best part of the trade to themselves. In\nall parts of external India they have dislodged from every field\nof employment not only their native but, progressively, even their\nEuropean competitors. Not less qualified and successful are they in\nthe pursuance of agriculture than in trade. The emigration from the\ntoo thickly peopled empire of China has scarcely begun. As yet it is\nbut a small stream, but it will by-and-by pour over all the tropical\ncountries of the East in one mighty torrent, completely destroying all\nsuch minor obstacles as jealous interference and impotent precaution\nmight interpose.",
        "[Sphere of futureinflunce.] Over every section of remote India,\nin the South Sea, in the Indian Archipelago, in the states of South\nAmerica, the Chinese seem destined, in time, either to supplant every\nother element, or to found a mixed race upon which to stamp their\nindividuality. In the Western States of the Union their number is\nrapidly on the increase; and the factories in California are worked\nentirely by them, achieving results that cannot be accomplished by\nEuropean labor.",
        "[Mongolian vs. Caucasion in America.] One of the most interesting of\nthe many questions of large comprehensiveness which connect themselves\nwith the penetration of the Mongolian race into America, which up\ntill now it had been the fashion to regard as the inheritance of the\nCaucasians, is the relative capacity of labor possessed by both these\ntwo great races, who in the Western States of America have for the\nfirst time measured their mutual strength in friendly rivalry. Both\nare there represented in their most energetic individuality; [254]\nand every nerve will be strained in carrying on the struggle, inasmuch\nas no other country pays for labor at so high a rate.",
        "[Efficiency and reliability of Chinese labor.] The conditions, however,\nare not quite equal, as the law places certain obstacles in the way of\nthe Chinese. The courts do not protect them sufficiently from insult,\nwhich at times is aggravated into malicious manslaughter through\nthe ill-usage of the mob, who hate them bitterly as being reserved,\nuncompanionable workers. Nevertheless, the Chinese immigrants take\ntheir stand firmly. The western division of the Pacific Railway has\nbeen chiefly built by the Chinese, who, according to the testimony of\nthe engineers, surpass workmen of all other nationalities in diligence,\nsobriety, and good conduct. What they lack in physical power they\nmake up for in perseverance and working intelligently together. The\nunique and nearly incredible performance that took place on April 28,\n1859, when ten miles of railway track were laid in eleven working\nhours along a division of land which had in no way been prepared\nbeforehand, was accomplished by Chinese workmen; and indeed only by\nthem could it have been practicable. [255]",
        "[Chinese cleverness and industry.] Of course, the superiority of the\nEuropean in respect Chinese of the highest intellectual faculties is\nnot for a moment to be doubted; but, in all branches of commercial\nlife in which cleverness and perservering industry are necessary to\nsuccess, the Chinese certainly appear entitled to the award. To us\nit appears that the influx of Chinese must certainly sooner or later\nkindle a struggle between capital and labor, in order to set a limit\nupon demands perceptibly growing beyond moderation.",
        "[Chinese problem in America.] The increasing Chinese immigration\nalready intrudes upon the attention of American statesmen questions of\nthe utmost social and political importance. What influence will this\nentirely new and strange element exercise over the conformation of\nAmerican relations? Will the Chinese found a State in the States, or go\ninto the Union on terms of political equality with the other citizens,\nand form a new race by alliance with the Caucasian element? These\nproblems, which can only be touched upon here in a transitory form,\nhave been dealt with in a masterly manner by Pumpelly, in his work\nAcross America and Asia, published in London in 1870.",
        "Letter of the Commissary-General of Chinchew to Don Pedro De Acuña,\nGovernor of the Philippines",
        "To the powerful Captain-General of Luzon:",
        "“Having been given to understand that the Chinese who proceeded to\nthe kingdom of Luzon in order to buy and sell had been murdered by\nthe Spaniards, I have investigated the motives for these massacres,\nand begged the Emperor to exercise justice upon those who had engaged\nin these abominable offences, with a view to security in the future.",
        "“In former years, before my arrival here as royal commissioner, a\nChinese merchant named Tioneg, together with three mandarins, went\nwith the permission of the Emperor of China from Luzon to Cavite,\nfor the purpose of prospecting for gold and silver; which appears to\nhave been an excuse, for he found neither gold nor silver; I thereupon\nprayed the Emperor to punish this imposter Tioneg, thereby making\npatent the strict justice which is exercised in China.",
        "“It was during the administration of the ex-Viceroy and Eunuchs\nthat Tioneg and his companion, named Yanglion, uttered the untruth\nalready stated; and subsequently I begged the Emperor to transmit\nall the papers bearing upon the matter, together with the minutes\nof Tioneg’s accusation; when I myself examined the before-mentioned\npapers, and knew that everything that the accused Tioneg had said\nwas utterly untrue.",
        "“I wrote to the Emperor and stated that, on account of the untruth\nwhich Tioneg had been guilty of, the Castilians entertained the\nsuspicion that he wished to make war upon them, and that they,\nunder this idea, had murdered more than thirty thousand Chinese in\nLuzon. The Emperor, complying with my request, punished the accused\nYanglion, though he omitted to put him to death; neither was Tioneg\nbeheaded or confined in a cage. The Chinese people who had settled in\nLuzon were in no way to blame. I and others discussed this with the\nEmperor in order to ascertain what his pleasure was in this matter,\nas well as in another, namely, the arrival of two English ships on\nthe coast of Chinchew (Fukien or Amoy district)–a very dangerous\ncircumstance for China; and to obtain His Imperial Majesty’s decision\nas to both these most serious matters.",
        "“We also wrote to the Emperor that he should direct the punishment of\nboth these Chinese; and, in acknowledging our communication, he replied\nto us, in respect to the English ships which had arrived in China,\nthat in case they had come for the purpose of plundering, they should\nbe immediately commanded to depart thence for Luzon; and, with regard\nto the Luzon difficulty, that the Castilians should be advised to give\nno credence to rogues and liars from China; and both the Chinese who\nhad discovered the harbor to the English should be executed forthwith;\nand that in all other matters upon which we had written to him, our\nwill should be his. Upon receipt of this message by us–the Viceroy,\nthe Eunuch, and myself–we hereby send this our message to the Governor\nof Luzon, that his Excellency may know the greatness of the Emperor\nof China and of his Empire, for he is so powerful that he commands\nall upon which the sun and moon shine, and also that the Governor of\nLuzon may learn with what great wisdom this mighty empire is governed,\nand which power no one for many years has attempted to insult, although\nthe Japanese have sought to disturb the tranquillity of Korea, which\nbelongs to the Government of China. They did not succeed, but on the\ncontrary were driven out, and Korea has remained in perfect security\nand peace, which those in Luzon well know by report.",
        "“Years ago, after we learnt that so many Chinese perished in Luzon\non account of Tioneg’s lies, many of us mandarins met together,\nand resolved to leave it to the consideration of the Emperor to\ntake vengeance for so great a massacre; and we said as follows:–The\ncountry of Luzon is a wretched one, and of very little importance. It\nwas at one time only the abode of devils and serpents; and only\nbecause (within the last few years) so large a number of Chinese\nwent thither for the purpose of trading with the Castilians has it\nimproved to such an extent; in which improvement the accused Sangleyes\nmaterially assisted by hard labor, the walls being raised by them,\nhouses built, and gardens laid out, and other matters accomplished\nof the greatest use to the Castilians; and now the question is, why\nhas no consideration been paid for these services, and these good\noffices acknowledged with thanks, without cruelly murdering so many\npeople? And although we wrote to the King twice or thrice concerning\nthe circumstances, he answered us that he was indignant about the\nbefore-mentioned occurrences, and said for three reasons it is not\nadvisable to execute vengeance, nor to war against Luzon. The first\nis that for a long time till now the Castilians have been friends\nof the Chinese; the second, that no one can predict whether the\nCastilians or the Chinese would be victorious; and the third and last\nreason is, because those whom the Castilians have killed were wicked\npeople, ungrateful to China, their native country, their elders,\nand their parents, as they have not returned to China now for very\nmany years. These people, said the Emperor, he valued but little for\nthe foregoing reasons; and he commanded the Viceroy, the Eunuch, and\nmyself, to send this letter through those messengers, so that all in\nLuzon may know that the Emperor of China has a generous heart, great\nforbearance, and much mercy, in not declaring war against Luzon; and\nhis justice is indeed manifest, as he has already punished the liar\nTioneg. Now, as the Spaniards are wise and intelligent, how does it\nhappen that they are not sorry for having massacred so many people,\nfeeling no repentance thereat, and also are not kinder to those of the\nChinese who are still left? Then when the Castilians show a feeling of\ngood-will, and the Chinese and Sangleyes who left after the dispute\nreturn, and the indebted money is repaid, and the property which was\ntaken from the Sangleyes restored, then friendship will again exist\nbetween this empire and that, and every year trading-ships shall come\nand go; but if not, then the Emperor will allow no trading, but on the\ncontrary will at once command a thousand ships of war to be built,\nmanned with soldiers and relations of the slain, and will, with the\nassistance of other peoples and kingdoms who pay tribute to China, wage\nrelentless war, without quarter to any one; and upon its conclusion\nwill present the kingdom of Luzon to those who do homage to China.",

        "[Spain’s discovery and occupation.] The Philippines were discovered\nby Magellan on the 16th of March, 1521–St. Lazarus’ day. [256]\nBut it was not until 1564, [257] after many previous efforts had\nmiscarried, that Legaspi, who left New Spain with five ships, took\npossession of the Archipelago in the name of Philip II. The discoverer\nhad christened the islands after the sanctified Lazarus. This name,\nhowever, never grew into general use; [Numerous names.] the Spaniards\npersistently calling them the Western Islands–Islas del Poniente;\nand the Portuguese, Islas del Oriente. Legaspi gave them their present\nname [258] in honor of Philip II, who, in his turn, conferred upon\nthem the again extinct name of New Castile. [259] Legaspi first of\nall annexed Cebu, and then Panay; and six years later, in 1571, he\nfirst sub dued Manila, which was at that time a village surrounded by\npalisades, and commenced forthwith the construction of a fortified\ntown. The subjection of the remaining territory was effected so\nquickly that, upon the death of Legaspi (in August, 1572), all the\nwestern parts were in possession of the Spaniards. [Mindanao and\nSulu independent.] Numerous wild tribes in the interior, however,\nthe Mahomedan states of Mindanao and the Sulu group, for example,\nhave to this day preserved their independence. The character of\nthe people, as well as their political disposition, favored the\noccupancy. There was no mighty power, no old dynasty, no influential\npriestly domination to overcome, no traditions of national pride to\nsuppress. The natives were either heathens, or recently proselytized\nsuperficially to Islamism, and lived under numerous petty chiefs, who\nruled them despotically, made war upon one another, and were easily\nsubdued. Such a community was called Barangay; and it forms to this\nday, though in a considerably modified form, the foundation of the\nconstitutional laws. [Spanish improvemnts.] The Spaniards limited the\npower of the petty chiefs, upheld slavery, and abolished hereditary\nnobility and dignity, substituting in its place an aristocracy\ncreated by themselves for services rendered to the State; but they\ncarried out all these changes very gradually and cautiously. [260]\nThe old usages and laws, so long as they did not interfere with the\nnatural course of government, remained untouched and were operative\nby legal sanction; and even in criminal matters their validity was\nequal to those emanating from the Spanish courts. To this day the\nchiefs of Barangay, with the exception of those bearing the title\nof “Don,” have no privileges save exemption from the poll-tax and\nsocage service. [Unthinking policy of greed.] They are virtually\ntax-collectors, excepting that they are not paid for such service,\nand their private means are made responsible for any deficit. The\nprudence of such a measure might well be doubted, without regard to\nthe fact that it tempts the chiefs to embezzlement and extortion;\nand it must alienate a class of natives who would otherwise be a\nsupport to the Government.",
        "[High character of early administrators.] Since the measures adopted in\nalleviation of the conquest and occupancy succeeded in so remarkable\na manner, the governors and their subordinates of those days, at a\ntime when Spain was powerful and chivalrous, naturally appear to have\nbeen distinguished for wisdom and high spirit. Legaspi possessed both\nqualities in a marked degree. Hardy adventurers were tempted there,\nas in America, by privileges and inducements which power afforded\nthem; as well as by the hope, which, fortunately for the country, was\nnever realized, of its being rich in auriferous deposits. In Luzon,\nfor instance, Hernando Riquel stated that there were many goldmines in\nseveral places which were seen by the Spaniards; “the ore is so rich\nthat I will not write any more about it, as I might possibly come under\na suspicion of exaggerating; but I swear by Christ that there is more\ngold on this island than there is iron in all Biscay.” [Conquerors\non commission.] They received no pay from the kingdom; but a formal\nright was given them to profit by any territory which was brought into\nsubjection by them. Some of these expeditions in search of conquest\nwere enterprises undertaken for private gain, others for the benefit\nof the governor; and such service was rewarded by him with grants of\nlands, carrying an annuity, offices, and other benefits (encomiendas,\noficios y aprovechamientos). The grants were at first made for three\ngenerations (in New Spain for four), but were very soon limited\nto two; when De los Rios pointed this out as being a measure very\nprejudicial to the Crown, “since they were little prepared to serve\nhis Majesty, as their grand-children had fallen into the most extreme\npoverty.” After the death of the feoffee the grant reverted to the\nState; and the governor thereupon disposed of it anew.",
        "[The feudal “encomiendas.\"] The whole country at the outset was\ncompletely divided into these livings, the defraying of which formed by\nfar the largest portion of the expenses of the kingdom. Investitures of\na similar nature existed, more or less, in a territory of considerable\nextent, the inhabitants of which had to pay tribute to the feoffee;\nand this tribute had to be raised out of agricultural produce, the\nvalue of which was fixed by the feudal lord at a very low rate, but\nsold by him to the Chinese at a considerable profit. The feudal lords,\nmoreover, were not satisfied with these receipts, but held the natives\nin a state of slavery, until forbidden by a Bull of Pope Gregory XIV,\ndated April 18, 1591. Kafir and negro slaves, whom the Portuguese\nimported by way of India, were, however, still permitted.",
        "[Extortions of encomenderos.] The original holders of feudal tenures\namassed considerable booty therefrom. Zuñiga relates that as early\nas the time of Lavezares, who was provisional governor between 1572\nand 1575, he visited the Bisayas and checked the covetousness of\nthe encomenderos, so that at least during his rule they relaxed\ntheir system of extortion. Towards the end of Sande’s government\n(1575-80) a furious quarrel broke out between the priests and the\nencomenderos; the first preached against the oppression of the\nlatter, and memorialized Philip II thereon. The king commanded that\nthe natives should be protected, as the extortionate greed of the\nfeudal chiefs had exceeded all bounds; and the natives were then at\nliberty to pay their tribute either in money or in kind. The result of\nthis well-intentioned regulation appears to have produced a greater\nassiduity both in agriculture and trade, “as the natives preferred\nto work without coercion, not on account of extreme want.” [Salcedo\n\"most illustrious of the conquerors.\"] And here I may briefly refer to\nthe achievements of Juan de Salcedo, the most illustrious of all the\nconquerors. Supported by his grandfather, Legaspi, with forty-five\nSpanish soldiers, he fitted out an expedition at his own expense,\nembarked at Manila, in May, 1572, examined all parts of the west coast\nof the island, landed in all the bays which were accessible to his\nlight-draught ships, and was well received by the natives at most of\nthe places. He generally found great opposition in penetrating into\nthe interior; yet he succeeded in subduing many of the inland tribes;\nand when he reached Cape Bojeador, the north-west point of Luzon, the\nextensive territory which at present forms the provinces of Zambales,\nPangasinan, and Ilocos Notre and Sur, acknowledged the Spanish\nrule. The exhaustion of his soldiers obliged Salcedo to return. In\nVigan, the present capital of Ilocos Sur, he constructed a fort, and\nleft therein for its protection his lieutenant and twenty-five men,\nwhile he himself returned, accompanied only by seventeen soldiers, in\nthree small vessels. In this manner he reached the Cagayan River, and\nproceeded up it until forced by the great number of hostile natives to\nretreat to the sea. Pursuing the voyage to the east coast, he came down\nin course of time to Paracale, where he embarked in a boat for Manila,\nwas capsized, and rescued from drowning by some passing natives.",
        "[\"The Cortes of the Philippines.\"] In the meantime Legaspi had died,\nand Lavezares was provisionally carrying on the government. Salcedo\nheard of this with vexation at being passed over; but, when he\nrecovered from his jealousy, he was entrusted with the subjugation of\nCamarines, which he accomplished in a short time. In 1574 he returned\nto Ilocos, in order to distribute annuities among his soldiers, and to\nreceive his own share. While still employed upon the building of Vigan,\nhe discovered the fleet of the notorious Chinese pirate, Limahong, who,\nbent upon taking possession of the colony, was then passing that part\nof the coast with sixty-two ships and a large number of soldiers. He\nhastened at once, with all the help which he could summon together in\nthe neighborhood, to Manila, where he was nominated to the command of\nthe troops, in the place of the already deposed master of the forces;\nand he drove the Chinese from the town, which they had destroyed. They\nthen withdrew to Pangasinan, and Salcedo burnt their fleet; which\nexploit was achieved with very great difficulty. In 1576 this Cortes\nof the Philippines died. [261]",
        "[Commercial importance of early Manila.] Apart from the priests, the\nfirst-comers consisted only of officials, soldiers, and sailors; and to\nthem, naturally, fell all the high profits of the China trade. Manila\nwas their chief market, and it also attracted a great portion of the\nexternal Indian trade, which the Portuguese had frightened away from\nMalacca by their excessive cruelty. The Portuguese, it is true, still\nremained in Macao and the Moluccas: but they wanted those remittances\nwhich were almost exclusively sought after by the Chinese, viz.,\nthe silver which Manila received from New Spain.",
        "[Spain and Portugal united.] In 1580 Portugal, together with all\nits colonies, was handed over to the Spanish Crown; and the period\nextending from this event to the decay of Portugal (1580-1640)\nwitnessed the Philippines at the height of their power and prosperity.",
        "[Manila as capital of a vast empire.] The Governor of Manila ruled\nover a part of Mindanao, Sulu, the Moluccas, Formosa, and the original\nPortuguese possessions in Malacca and India. “All that lies between\nCape Singapore and Japan is subject to Luzon; their ships cross the\nocean to China and New Spain, and drive so magnificent a trade that,\nif it were only free, it would be the most extraordinary that the\nworld could show. It is incredible what glory these islands confer\nupon Spain. The Governor of the Philippines treats with the Kings of\nCambodia, Japan, China. The first is his ally, the last his friend;\nand the same with Japan. He declares war or peace, without waiting\nfor the command from distant Spain.” [262] [Dutch opposition.] But\nthe Dutch had now begun the struggle, which they managed to carry\non against Philip II in every corner of the world; and even in 1510\nDe Los Rios complained that he found the country very much altered\nthrough the progress and advance made by the Dutch; also that the Moros\nof Mindanao and Sulu, feeling that they were supported by Holland,\nwere continually in a state of discontent.",
        "[Decline of colony.] The downfall of Portugal occasioned the loss of\nher colonies once more. Spanish policy, the government of the priests,\nand the jealousy of the Spanish merchants and traders especially,\ndid everything that remained to be done to prevent the development\nof agriculture and commerce–perhaps, on the whole, fortunately,\nfor the natives.",
        "[Philippine history unimportant and unsatisfactory.] The\nsubsequent history of the Philippines is, in all its particulars,\nquite as unsatisfactory and uninteresting as that of all the other\nSpanish-American possessions. Ineffectual expeditions against pirates,\nand continual disputes between the clerical and secular authorities,\nform the principal incidents. [263]",
        "[Undesirable emigrants from Spain.] After the first excitement of\nreligious belief and military renown had subsided, the minds of those\nwho went later to these outlying possessions, consisting generally as\nthey did of the very dregs of the nation, were seized with an intense\nfeeling of selfishness; and frauds and peculations were the natural\nsequence. The Spanish writers are full of descriptions of the wretched\nstate of society then existing, which it is unnecessary to repeat here.",
        "[English occupation.] The colony had scarcely been molested by\nexternal enemies, with the exception of pirates. In the earliest time\nthe Dutch had engaged occasionally in attacks on the Bisayas. But\nin 1762 (during the war of the Bourbon succession) an English fleet\nsuddenly appeared before Manila, and took the surprised town without\nany difficulty. The Chinese allied themselves with the English. A\ngreat insurrection broke out among the Filipinos, and the colony,\nunder the provisional government of a feeble archbishop, was for a\ntime in great danger. It was reserved for other dignitaries of the\nChurch and Anda, an energetic patriot, to inflame the natives against\nthe foreigners; and the opposition incited by the zealousness of the\npriests grew to such an extent that the English, who were confined in\nthe town, were actually glad to be able to retreat. In the following\nyear the news arrived from Europe of the conclusion of peace; but\nin the interval this insurrection, brought about by the invasion,\nhad rapidly and considerably extended; and it was not suppressed\nuntil 1765, when the work was accomplished by creating enmity among\nthe different tribes. [264] But this was not done without a loss to\nthe province of Ilocos of two hundred sixty-nine thousand two hundred\nand seventy persons–half of the population, as represented by Zuñiga.",
        "[Many minor uprisings from local grievances.] Severity and want of\ntact on the part of the Government and their instruments, as well as\nbigoted dissensions have caused many revolts of the natives; yet none,\nit is true, of any great danger to the Spanish rule. The discontent\nhas always been confined to a single district, as the natives do\nnot form a united nation; neither the bond of a common speech nor\na general interest binding the different tribes together. The state\ncommunications and laws among them scarcely reach beyond the borders\nof the villages and their dependencies.",
        "[Danger from mestizos and creoles.] A consideration of far more\nimportance to the distant metropolis than the condition of the\nconstantly excited natives, who are politically divided among\nthemselves, and really have no steady object in view, is the attitude\nof the mestizos and creoles, whose discontent increases in proportion\nto their numbers and prosperity. The military revolt which broke\nout in 1823, the leaders of which were two creoles, might easily\nhave terminated fatally for Spain. The latest of all the risings of\nthe mestizos seems to have been the most dangerous, not only to the\nSpanish power, but to all the European population. [265]",
        "[Cavite 1872 mutiny.] On the 20th of January, 1872, between eight and\nnine in the evening, the artillery, marines, and the garrison of the\narsenal revolted in Cavite, the naval base of the Philippines, and\nmurdered their officers; and a lieutenant who endeavored to carry the\nintelligence to Manila fell into the hands of a crowd of natives. The\nnews therefore did not reach the capital until the next morning, when\nall the available troops were at once dispatched, and, after a heavy\npreliminary struggle, they succeeded the following day in storming\nthe citadel. A dreadful slaughter of the rebels ensued. Not a soul\nescaped. Among them was not a single European; but there were many\nmestizos, of whom several were priests and lawyers. Though perhaps\nthe first accounts, written under the influence of terror, may have\nexaggerated many particulars, yet both official and private letters\nagree in describing the conspiracy as being long contemplated, widely\nspread, and well planned. The whole fleet and a large number of troops\nwere absent at the time, engaged in the expedition against Sulu. A\nportion of the garrison of Manila were to rise at the same time as\nthe revolt in Cavite, and thousands of natives were to precipitate\nthemselves on the caras blancas (pale faces), and murder them. The\nfailure of the conspiracy was, it appears, only attributable to a\nfortunate accident–to the circumstance, namely, that a body of the\nrebels mistook some rocket fired upon the occasion of a Church festival\nfor the agreed signal, and commenced the attack too soon. [266]",
        "[Summing up.] Let me be permitted, in conclusion, to bring together a\nfew observations which have been scattered through the text, touching\nthe relations of the Philippines with foreign countries, and briefly\nspeculate thereon.",
        "[Credit due Spain.] Credit is certainly due to Spain for having\nbettered the condition of a people who, though comparatively speaking\nhighly civilized, yet being continually distracted by petty wars,\nhad sunk into a disordered and uncultivated state. The inhabitants of\nthese beautiful islands, upon the whole, may well be considered to\nhave lived as comfortably during the last hundred years, protected\nfrom all external enemies and governed by mild laws, as those of\nany other tropical country under native or European sway,–owing,\nin some measure, to the frequently discussed peculiar circumstances\nwhich protect the interests of the natives.",
        "[Friars an important factor.] The friars, also, have certainly had\nan essential part in the production of the results.",
        "[Their defects have worked out for good.] Sprung from the lowest\norders, inured to hardship and want, and on terms of the closest\nintimacy with the natives, they were peculiarly fitted to introduce\nthem to a practical conformity with the new religion and code\nof morality. Later on, also, when they possessed rich livings,\nand their devout and zealous interest in the welfare of the masses\nrelaxed in proportion as their incomes increased, they materially\nassisted in bringing about the circumstances already described,\nwith their favorable and unfavorable aspects. Further, possessing\nneither family nor good education, they were disposed to associate\nthemselves intimately with the natives and their requirements;\nand their arrogant opposition to the temporal power generally arose\nthrough their connection with the natives. With the altered condition\nof things, however, all this has disappeared. The colony can no\nlonger be kept secluded from the world. Every facility afforded for\ncommercial intercourse is a blow to the old system, and a great step\nmade in the direction of broad and liberal reforms. The more foreign\ncapital and foreign ideas and customs are introduced, increasing\nthe prosperity, enlightenment, and self-respect of the population,\nthe more impatiently will the existing evils be endured.",
        "[Contrast with English colonies.] England can and does open her\npossessions unconcernedly to the world. The British colonies are\nunited to the mother country by the bond of mutual advantage,\nviz. the production of raw material by means of English capital,\nand the exchange of the same for English manufactures. The wealth\nof England is so great, the organization of her commerce with the\nworld so complete, that nearly all the foreigners even in the British\npossessions are for the most part agents for English business houses,\nwhich would scarcely be affected, at least to any marked extent,\nby a political dismemberment. It is entirely different with Spain,\nwhich possesses the colony as an inherited property, and without the\npower of turning it to any useful account.",
        "[Menaces to Spanish rule.] Government monopolies rigorously maintained,\ninsolent disregard and neglect of the mestizos and powerful creoles,\nand the example of the United States, were the chief reasons of the\ndownfall of the American possessions. The same causes threaten ruin\nto the Philippines: but of the monopolies I have said enough.",
        "[Growing American influence.] Mestizos and creoles, it is true, are\nnot, as they formerly were in America, excluded from all official\nappointments; but they feel deeply hurt and injured through the\ncrowds of place-hunters which the frequent changes of ministries\nsend to Manila. The influence, also, of the American element is at\nleast visible on the horizon, and will be more noticeable when the\nrelations increase between the two countries. At present they are\nvery slender. The trade in the meantime follows in its old channels to\nEngland and to the Atlantic ports of the United States. Nevertheless,\nwhoever desires to form an opinion upon the future history of the\nPhilippines, must not consider simply their relations to Spain,\nbut must have regard to the prodigious changes which a few decades\nproduce on either side of our planet.",
        "[Powerful neighbors] For the first time in the history of the world\nthe mighty powers on both sides of the ocean have commenced to enter\nupon a direct intercourse with one another–Russia, which alone is\nlarger than any two other parts of the earth; China, which contains\nwithin its own boundaries a third of the population of the world;\nand America, with ground under cultivation nearly sufficient to feed\ntreble the total population of the earth. Russia’s future role in\nthe Pacific Ocean is not to be estimated at present.",
        "[China and America.] The trade between the two other great powers will\ntherefore be presumably all the heavier, as the rectification of the\npressing need of human labor on the one side, and of the corresponding\noverplus on the other, will fall to them.",
        "[Nearing predominance of the Pacific.] The world of the ancients was\nconfined to the shores of the Mediterranean; and the Atlantic and\nIndian Oceans sufficed at one time for our traffic. When first the\nshores of the Pacific re-echoed with the sounds of active commerce,\nthe trade of the world and the history of the world may be really\nsaid to have begun. A start in that direction has been made; whereas\nnot so very long ago the immense ocean was one wide waste of waters,\ntraversed from both points only once a year. From 1603 to 1769 scarcely\na ship had ever visited California, that wonderful country which,\ntwenty-five years ago, with the exception of a few places on the coast,\nwas an unknown wilderness, but which is now covered with flourishing\nand prosperous towns and cities, served by a sea-to-sea railway, and\nits capital already ranking the third of the seaports of the Union;\neven at this early stage of its existence a central point of the\nworld’s commerce, and apparently destined, by the proposed junction\nof the great oceans, to play a most important part in the future.",
        "[The mission of America.] In proportion as the navigation of the west\ncoast of America extends the influence of the American element over\nthe South Sea, the captivating, magic power which the great republic\nexercises over the Spanish colonies [267] will not fail to make itself\nfelt also in the Philippines, The Americans are evidently destined to\nbring to a full development the germs originated by the Spaniards. As\nconquerors of modern times, representing the age of free citizens in\ncontrast to the age of knighthood, they follow with the plow and the\naxe of the pioneer, where the former advanced under the sign of the\ncross with their swords.",
        "[Superiority over Spanish system.] A considerable portion of\nSpanish-America already belongs to the United States, and has since\nattained an importance which could not possibly have been anticipated\neither under the Spanish Government or during the anarchy which\nfollowed. With regard to permanence, the Spanish system cannot for a\nmoment be compared with that of America. While each of the colonies,\nin order to favor a privileged class by immediate gains, exhausted\nstill more the already enfeebled population of the metropolis by the\nwithdrawal of the best of its ability, America, on the contrary, has\nattracted to itself from all countries the most energetic element,\nwhich, once on its soil and, freed from all fetters, restlessly\nprogressing, has extended its power and influence still further and\nfurther. The Philippines will escape the action of the two great\nneighboring powers all the less for the fact that neither they nor\ntheir metropolis find their condition of a stable and well-balanced\nnature.",
        "[Need of Philippine awakening.] It seems to be desirable for the\nFilipinos that the above-mentioned views should not speedily become\naccomplished facts, because their education and training hitherto\nhave not been of a nature to prepare them successfully to compete\nwith either of the other two energetic, creative, and progressive\nnations. They have, in truth, dreamed away their best days.",
