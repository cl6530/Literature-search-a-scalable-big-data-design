        "\nAbraham Lincoln (1809-1865)\n16th President of the United States",
        "\n\n",
        "The first winter in Illinois, 1830-31, was one of those epochal seasons\nwhich come to all communities. It is remembered by “the oldest\ninhabitant” to this day for the extraordinary amount of snow that fell.\nThere is little doing in such a community during any winter; but in\nsuch a winter as that there was practically nothing doing. Lincoln\nalways held himself ready to accept any opportunity for work, but there\nwas no opening that winter. The only thing he accomplished was what he\ndid every winter and every summer of his life: namely, he made many\nfriends.",
        "When spring opened, Denton Offutt decided to send a cargo of\nmerchandise down to New Orleans. Hearing that Lincoln, John Hanks, and\nJohn Johnston were “likely boys,” he employed them to take charge of\nthe enterprise. Their pay was to be fifty cents a day and “found,” and,\nif the enterprise proved successful, an additional sum of twenty\ndollars. Lincoln said that none of them had ever seen so much money at\none time, and they were glad to accept the offer.",
        "Two events occurred during this trip which are of sufficient interest\nto bear narration.",
        "The boat with its cargo had been set afloat in the Sangamon River at\nSpringfield. All went well until, at New Salem, they came to a mill dam\nwhere, in spite of the fact that the water was high, owing to the\nspring floods, the boat stuck. Lincoln rolled his trousers “five feet\nmore or less” up his long, lank legs, waded out to the boat, and got\nthe bow over the dam. Then, without waiting to bail the water out, he\nbored a hole in the bottom and let it run out. He constructed a machine\nwhich lifted and pushed the boat over the obstruction, and thus their\nvoyage was quickly resumed. Many years later, when he was a practising\nlawyer, he whittled out a model of his invention and had it patented.\nThe model may to-day be seen in the patent office at Washington. The\npatent brought him no fortune, but it is an interesting relic.",
        "This incident is of itself entirely unimportant. It is narrated here\nsolely because it illustrates one trait of the man–his ingenuity. He\nhad remarkable fertility in devising ways and means of getting out of\nunexpected difficulties. When, in 1860, the Ship of State seemed like\nto run aground hopelessly, it was his determination and ingenuity that\naverted total wreck. As in his youth he saved the flatboat, so in his\nmature years he saved the nation.",
        "The other event was that at New Orleans, where he saw with his own eyes\nsome of the horrors of slavery. He never could tolerate a moral wrong.\nAt a time when drinking was almost universal, he was a total abstainer.\nThough born in a slave state, he had an earnest and growing repugnance\nto slavery. Still, up to this time he had never seen much of its\nworkings. At this time he saw a slave market–the auctioning off of\nhuman beings.",
        "The details of this auction were so coarse and vile that it is\nimpossible to defile these pages with an accurate and faithful\ndescription. Lincoln saw it all. He saw a beautiful mulatto girl\nexhibited like a race-horse, her “points” dwelt on, one by one, in\norder, as the auctioneer said, that “bidders might satisfy themselves\nwhether the article they were offering to buy was sound or not.” One of\nhis companions justly said slavery ran the iron into him then and\nthere. His soul was stirred with a righteous indignation. Turning to\nthe others he exclaimed with a solemn oath: “Boys, if ever I get a\nchance to hit that thing [slavery] I’ll hit it hard!”",
        "He bided his time. One-third of a century later he had the chance to\nhit that thing. He redeemed his oath. He hit it hard.",
