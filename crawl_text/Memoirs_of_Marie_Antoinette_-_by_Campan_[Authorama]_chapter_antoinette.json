        "Being the Historic Memoirs of Madam Campan,\nFirst Lady in Waiting to the Queen",
        "Louis XVI. possessed an immense crowd of confidants, advisers, and\nguides; he selected them even from among the factions which attacked him.\nNever, perhaps, did he make a full disclosure to any one of them, and\ncertainly he spoke with sincerity, to but very few.  He invariably kept\nthe reins of all secret intrigues in his own hand; and thence, doubtless,\narose the want of cooperation and the weakness which were so conspicuous\nin his measures.  From these causes considerable chasms will be found in\nthe detailed history of the Revolution.",
        "In order to become thoroughly acquainted with the latter years of the\nreign of Louis XV., memoirs written by the Duc de Choiseul, the Duc\nd’Aiguillon, the Marechal de Richelieu,",
        "     [I heard Le Marechal de Richelieu desire M. Campan, who was\n     librarian to the Queen, not to buy the Memoirs which would certainly\n     be attributed to him after his death, declaring them false by\n     anticipation; and adding that he was ignorant of orthography, and\n     had never amused himself with writing.  Shortly after the death of\n     the Marshal, one Soulavie put forth Memoirs of the Marechal de\n     Richelieu.]",
        "and the Duc de La Vauguyon, should be before us.  To give us a faithful\nportrait of the unfortunate reign of Louis XVI., the Marechal du Muy,\nM. de Maurepas, M. de Vergennes, M. de Malesherbes, the Duc d’Orleans,\nM. de La Fayette, the Abby de Vermond, the Abbe Montesquiou, Mirabeau,\nthe Duchesse de Polignac, and the Duchesse de Luynes should have noted\nfaithfully in writing all the transactions in which they took decided\nparts.  The secret political history of a later period has been\ndisseminated among a much greater number of persons; there are Ministers\nwho have published memoirs, but only when they had their own measures to\njustify, and then they confined themselves to the vindication of their\nown characters, without which powerful motive they probably would have\nwritten nothing.  In general, those nearest to the Sovereign, either by\nbirth or by office, have left no memoirs; and in absolute monarchies the\nmainsprings of great events will be found in particulars which the most\nexalted persons alone could know.  Those who have had but little under\ntheir charge find no subject in it for a book; and those who have long\nborne the burden of public business conceive themselves to be forbidden\nby duty, or by respect for authority, to disclose all they know.  Others,\nagain, preserve notes, with the intention of reducing them to order when\nthey shall have reached the period of a happy leisure; vain illusion of\nthe ambitious, which they cherish, for the most part, but as a veil to\nconceal from their sight the hateful image of their inevitable downfall!\nand when it does at length take place, despair or chagrin deprives them\nof fortitude to dwell upon the dazzling period which they never cease to\nregret.",
        "Louis XVI.  meant to write his own memoirs; the manner in which his\nprivate papers were arranged indicated this design.  The Queen also had\nthe same intention; she long preserved a large correspondence, and a\ngreat number of minute reports, made in the spirit and upon the event of\nthe moment.  But after the 20th of June, 1792, she was obliged to burn\nthe larger portion of what she had so collected, and the remainder were\nconveyed out of France.",
        "Considering the rank and situations of the persons I have named as\ncapable of elucidating by their writings the history of our political\nstorms, it will not be imagined that I aim at placing myself on a level\nwith them; but I have spent half my life either with the daughters of\nLouis XV. or with Marie Antoinette.  I knew the characters of those\nPrincesses; I became privy to some extraordinary facts, the publication\nof which may be interesting, and the truth of the details will form the\nmerit of my work.",
        "I was very young when I was placed about the Princesses, the daughters of\nLouis XV., in the capacity of reader.  I was acquainted with the Court of\nVersailles before the time of the marriage of Louis XVI. with the\nArchduchess Marie Antoinette.",
        "My father, who was employed in the department of Foreign Affairs, enjoyed\nthe reputation due to his talents and to his useful labours.  He had\ntravelled much.  Frenchmen, on their return home from foreign countries,\nbring with them a love for their own, increased in warmth; and no man was\nmore penetrated with this feeling, which ought to be the first virtue of\nevery placeman, than my father.  Men of high title, academicians, and\nlearned men, both natives and foreigners, sought my father’s\nacquaintance, and were gratified by being admitted into his house.",
        "Twenty years before the Revolution I often heard it remarked that the\nimposing character of the power of Louis XIV. was no longer to be found\nin the Palace of Versailles; that the institutions of the ancient\nmonarchy were rapidly sinking; and that the people, crushed beneath the\nweight of taxes, were miserable, though silent; but that they began to\ngive ear to the bold speeches of the philosophers, who loudly proclaimed\ntheir sufferings and their rights; and, in short, that the age would not\npass away without the occurrence of some great outburst, which would\nunsettle France, and change the course of its progress.",
        "Those who thus spoke were almost all partisans of M. Turgot’s system of\nadministration: they were Mirabeau the father, Doctor Quesnay, Abbe\nBandeau, and Abbe Nicoli, charge d’affaires to Leopold, Grand Duke of\nTuscany, and as enthusiastic an admirer of the maxims of the innovators\nas his Sovereign.",
        "My father sincerely respected the purity of intention of these\npoliticians.  With them he acknowledged many abuses in the Government;\nbut he did not give these political sectarians credit for the talent\nnecessary for conducting a judicious reform.  He told them frankly that\nin the art of moving the great machine of Government, the wisest of them\nwas inferior to a good magistrate; and that if ever the helm of affairs\nshould be put into their hands, they would be speedily checked in the\nexecution of their schemes by the immeasurable difference existing\nbetween the most brilliant theories and the simplest practice of\nadministration.",
        "Destiny having formerly placed me near crowned heads, I now amuse my\nsolitude when in retirement with collecting a variety of facts which may\nprove interesting to my family when I shall be no more.  The idea of\ncollecting all the interesting materials which my memory affords occurred\nto me from reading the work entitled “Paris, Versailles, and the\nProvinces in the Eighteenth Century.”  That work, composed by a man\naccustomed to the best society, is full of piquant anecdotes, nearly all\nof which have been recognised as true by the contemporaries of the\nauthor.  I have put together all that concerned the domestic life of an\nunfortunate Princess, whose reputation is not yet cleared of the stains\nit received from the attacks of calumny, and who justly merited a\ndifferent lot in life, a different place in the opinion of mankind after\nher fall.  These memoirs, which were finished ten years ago, have met\nwith the approbation of some persons; and my son may, perhaps, think\nproper to print them after my decease.",

        "JEANNE LOUISE HENRIETTE GENET was born in Paris on the 6th of October,\n1752.  M. Genet, her father, had obtained, through his own merit and the\ninfluence of the Duc de Choiseul, the place of first clerk in the Foreign\nOffice.",
        "Literature, which he had cultivated in his youth, was often the solace of\nhis leisure hours.  Surrounded by a numerous family, he made the\ninstruction of his children his chief recreation, and omitted nothing\nwhich was necessary to render them highly accomplished.  His clever and\nprecocious daughter Henriette was very early accustomed to enter society,\nand to take an intelligent interest in current topics and public events.\nAccordingly, many of her relations being connected with the Court or\nholding official positions, she amassed a fund of interesting\nrecollections and characteristic anecdotes, some gathered from personal\nexperience, others handed down by old friends of the family.",
        "“The first event which made any impression on me in my childhood,” she\nsays in her reminiscences, “was the attempt of Damiens to assassinate\nLouis XV.  This occurrence struck me so forcibly that the most minute\ndetails relating to the confusion and grief which prevailed at Versailles\non that day seem as present to my imagination as the most recent events.\nI had dined with my father and mother, in company with one of their\nfriends.  The drawing-room was lighted up with a number of candles, and\nfour card-tables were already occupied, when a friend of the gentleman of\nthe house came in, with a pale and terrified countenance, and said, in a\nvoice scarcely audible, ’I bring you terrible news.  The King has been\nassassinated!’  Two ladies in the company fainted; a brigadier of the\nBody Guards threw down his cards and cried out, ’I do not wonder at it;\nit is those rascally Jesuits.’–’What are you saying, brother?’ cried a\nlady, flying to him; ’would you get yourself arrested?’–’Arrested!  For\nwhat?  For unmasking those wretches who want a bigot for a King?’  My\nfather came in; he recommended circumspection, saying that the blow was\nnot mortal, and that all meetings ought to be suspended at so critical a\nmoment.  He had brought the chaise for my mother, who placed me on her\nknees.  We lived in the Avenue de Paris, and throughout our drive I heard\nincessant cries and sobs from the footpaths.",
        "“At last I saw a man arrested; he was an usher of the King’s chamber, who\nhad gone mad, and was crying out, ’Yes, I know them; the wretches! the\nvillains!’  Our chaise was stopped by this bustle.  My mother recognised\nthe unfortunate man who had been seized; she gave his name to the trooper\nwho had stopped him.  The poor usher was therefore merely conducted to\nthe gens d’armes’ guardroom, which was then in the avenue.",
        "“I have often heard M. de Landsmath, equerry and master of the hounds,\nwho used to come frequently to my father’s, say that on the news of the\nattempt on the King’s life he instantly repaired to his Majesty.\nI cannot repeat the coarse expressions he made use of to encourage his\nMajesty; but his account of the affair, long afterwards, amused the\nparties in which he was prevailed on to relate it, when all apprehensions\nrespecting the consequences of the event had subsided.  This M. de\nLandsmath was an old soldier, who had given proofs of extraordinary\nvalour; nothing had been able to soften his manners or subdue his\nexcessive bluntness to the respectful customs of the Court.  The King was\nvery fond of him.  He possessed prodigious strength, and had often\ncontended with Marechal Saxe, renowned for his great bodily power, in\ntrying the strength of their respective wrists.",
        "     [One day when the King was hunting in the forest of St. Germain,\n     Landemath, riding before him, wanted a cart, filled with the slime\n     of a pond that had just been cleansed, to draw up out of the way.\n     The carter resisted, and even answered with impertinence.\n     Landsmath, without dismounting, seized him by the breast of his\n     coat, lifted him up, and threw him into his cart.–MADAME CAMPAN.",
        "“M. de Landsmath had a thundering voice.  When he came into the King’s\napartment he found the Dauphin and Mesdames, his Majesty’s daughters,\nthere; the Princesses, in tears, surrounded the King’s bed.  Send out all\nthese weeping women, Sire,’ said the old equerry; ’I want to speak to you\nalone: The King made a sign to the Princesses to withdraw.  ’Come,’ said\nLandsmath, ’your wound is nothing; you had plenty of waistcoats and\nflannels on.’  Then uncovering his breast, ’Look here,’ said he, showing\nfour or five great scars, ’these are something like wounds; I received\nthem thirty years ago; now cough as loud as you can.’  The King did so.\n’’Tis nothing at all,’ said Landsmath; ’you must laugh at it; we shall\nhunt a stag together in four days.’–’But suppose the blade was\npoisoned,’ said the King.  ’Old grandams’ tales,’ replied Landsmath;\n’if it had been so, the waistcoats and flannels would have rubbed the\npoison off.’  The King was pacified, and passed a very good night.",
        "“His Majesty one day asked M. de Landsmath how old he was.  He was aged,\nand by no means fond of thinking of his age; he evaded the question.\nA fortnight later, Louis XV. took a paper out of his pocket and read\naloud: ’On such a day in the month of one thousand six hundred and\neighty, was baptised by me, rector of –––, the son of the high and\nmighty lord,’ etc.  ’What’s that?’ said Landsmath, angrily; ’has your\nMajesty been procuring the certificate of my baptism?’–’There it is, you\nsee, Landsmath,’ said the King.  ’Well, Sire, hide it as fast as you can;\na prince entrusted with the happiness of twenty-five millions of people\nought not wilfully to hurt the feelings of a single individual.’",
        "“The King learned that Landsmath had lost his confessor, a missionary\npriest of the parish of Notre-Dame.  It was the custom of the Lazarists\nto expose their dead with the face uncovered.  Louis XV. wished to try\nhis equerry’s firmness.  ’You have lost your confessor, I hear,’ said the\nKing.  ’Yes, Sire.’–’He will be exposed with his face bare?’–’Such is\nthe custom.’–’I command you to go and see him.’–’Sire, my confessor was\nmy friend; it would be very painful to me.’–’No matter; I command you.’\n–’Are you really in earnest, Sire?’–’Quite so.’–’It would be the first\ntime in my life that I had disobeyed my sovereign’s order.  I will go.’\nThe next day the King at his levee, as soon as he perceived Landsmath,\nsaid, ’Have you done as I desired you, Landsmath?’–’Undoubtedly, Sire.’\n–’Well, what did you see?’–’Faith, I saw that your Majesty and I are no\ngreat shakes!’",
        "“At the death of Queen Maria Leczinska, M. Campan,–[Her father-in-law,\nafterwards secretary to Marie Antoinette.]–then an officer of the\nchamber, having performed several confidential duties, the King asked\nMadame Adelaide how he should reward him.  She requested him to create an\noffice in his household of master of the wardrobe, with a salary of a\nthousand crowns.  ’I will do so,’ said the King; ’it will be an\nhonourable title; but tell Campan not to add a single crown to his\nexpenses, for you will see they will never pay him.’",
        "“Louis XV., by his dignified carriage, and the amiable yet majestic\nexpression of his features, was worthy to succeed to Louis the Great.\nBut he too frequently indulged in secret pleasures, which at last were\nsure to become known.  During several winters, he was passionately fond\nof ’candles’ end balls’, as he called those parties amongst the very\nlowest classes of society.  He got intelligence of the picnics given by\nthe tradesmen, milliners, and sempstresses of Versailles, whither he\nrepaired in a black domino, and masked, accompanied by the captain of his\nGuards, masked like himself.  His great delight was to go ’en brouette’–\n[In a kind of sedan-chair, running on two wheels, and drawn by a\nchairman.]–Care was always taken to give notice to five or six officers\nof the King’s or Queen’s chamber to be there, in order that his Majesty\nmight be surrounded by people on whom he could depend, without finding it\ntroublesome.  Probably the captain of the Guards also took other\nprecautions of this description on his part.  My father-in-law, when the\nKing and he were both young, has often made one amongst the servants\ndesired to attend masked at these parties, assembled in some garret, or\nparlour of a public-house.  In those times, during the carnival, masked\ncompanies had a right to join the citizens’ balls; it was sufficient that\none of the party should unmask and name himself.",
        "“These secret excursions, and his too habitual intercourse with ladies\nmore distinguished for their personal charms than for the advantages of\neducation, were no doubt the means by which the King acquired many vulgar\nexpressions which otherwise would never have reached his ears.",
        "“Yet amidst the most shameful excesses the King sometimes suddenly\nresumed the dignity of his rank in a very noble manner.  The familiar\ncourtiers of Louis XV. had one day abandoned themselves to the\nunrestrained gaiety, of a supper, after returning from the chase.  Each\nboasted of and described the beauty of his mistress.  Some of them amused\nthemselves with giving a particular account of their wives’ personal\ndefects.  An imprudent word, addressed to Louis XV., and applicable only\nto the Queen, instantly dispelled all the mirth of the entertainment.\nThe King assumed his regal air, and knocking with his knife on the table\ntwice or thrice, ’Gentlemen; said he, ’here is the King!’",
        "“Those men who are most completely abandoned to dissolute manners are\nnot, on that account, insensible to virtue in women.  The Comtesse de\nPerigord was as beautiful as virtuous.  During some excursions she made\nto Choisy, whither she had been invited, she perceived that the King took\ngreat notice of her.  Her demeanour of chilling respect, her cautious\nperseverance in shunning all serious conversation with the monarch, were\ninsufficient to extinguish this rising flame, and he at length addressed\na letter to her, worded in the most passionate terms.  This excellent\nwoman instantly formed her resolution: honour forbade her returning the\nKing’s passion, whilst her profound respect for the sovereign made her\nunwilling to disturb his tranquillity.  She therefore voluntarily\nbanished herself to an estate she possessed called Chalais, near\nBarbezieux, the mansion of which had been uninhabited nearly a century;\nthe porter’s lodge was the only place in a condition to receive her.\nFrom this seat she wrote to his Majesty, explaining her motives for\nleaving Court; and she remained there several years without visiting\nParis.  Louis XV. was speedily attracted by other objects, and regained\nthe composure to which Madame de Perigord had thought it her duty to\nsacrifice so much.  Some years after, Mesdames’ lady of honour died.\nMany great families solicited the place.  The King, without answering any\nof their applications, wrote to the Comtesse de Perigord: ’My daughters\nhave just lost their lady of honour; this place, madame, is your due, as\nmuch on account of your personal qualities as of the illustrious name of\nyour family.’",
        "“Three young men of the college of St. Germain, who had just completed\ntheir course of studies, knowing no person about the Court, and having\nheard that strangers were always well treated there, resolved to dress\nthemselves completely in the Armenian costume, and, thus clad, to present\nthemselves to see the grand ceremony of the reception of several knights\nof the Order of the Holy Ghost.  Their stratagem met with all the success\nwith which they had flattered themselves.  While the procession was\npassing through the long mirror gallery, the Swiss of the apartments\nplaced them in the first row of spectators, recommending every one to pay\nall possible attention to the strangers.  The latter, however, were\nimprudent enough to enter the ’oeil-de-boeuf’ chamber, where, were\nMessieurs Cardonne and Ruffin, interpreters of Oriental languages, and\nthe first clerk of the consul’s department, whose business it was to\nattend to everything which related to the natives of the East who were in\nFrance.  The three scholars were immediately surrounded and questioned by\nthese gentlemen, at first in modern Greek.  Without being disconcerted,\nthey made signs that they did not understand it.  They were then\naddressed in Turkish and Arabic; at length one of the interpreters,\nlosing all patience, exclaimed, ’Gentlemen, you certainly must understand\nsome of the languages in which you have been addressed.  What country can\nyou possibly come from then?’–’From St. Germain-en-Laye, sir,’ replied\nthe boldest among them; ’this is the first time you have put the question\nto us in French.’  They then confessed the motive of their disguise; the\neldest of them was not more than eighteen years of age.  Louis XV. was\ninformed of the affair.  He laughed heartily, ordered them a few hours’\nconfinement and a good admonition, after which they were to be set at\nliberty.",
        "“Louis XV. liked to talk about death, though he was extremely\napprehensive of it; but his excellent health and his royal dignity\nprobably made him imagine himself invulnerable.  He often said to people\nwho had very bad colds, ’You’ve a churchyard cough there.’  Hunting one\nday in the forest of Senard, in a year in which bread was extremely dear,\nhe met a man on horseback carrying a coffin.  ’Whither are you carrying\nthat coffin?’–’To the village of –––,’ answered the peasant.  ’Is it\nfor a man or a woman?’–’For a man.’–’What did he die of?’–’Of hunger,’\nbluntly replied the villager.  The King spurred on his horse, and asked\nno more questions.",
        "“Weak as Louis XV. was, the Parliaments would never have obtained his\nconsent to the convocation of the States General.  I heard an anecdote on\nthis subject from two officers attached to that Prince’s household.  It\nwas at the period when the remonstrances of the Parliaments, and the\nrefusals to register the decrees for levying taxes, produced alarm with\nrespect to the state of the finances.  This became the subject of\nconversation one evening at the coucher of Louis XV.  ’You will see,\nSire,’ said a courtier, whose office placed him in close communication\nwith the King, ’that all this will make it absolutely necessary to\nassemble the States General!’",
        "“The King, roused by this speech from the habitual apathy of his\ncharacter, seized the courtier by the arm, and said to him, in a passion,\n’Never repeat, these words.  I am not sanguinary; but had I a brother,\nand were he to dare to give me such advice, I would sacrifice him, within\ntwenty-four hours, to the duration of the monarchy and the tranquillity\nof the kingdom.’",
        "“Several years prior to his death the Dauphin, the father of Louis XVI.,\nhad confluent smallpox, which endangered his life; and after his\nconvalescence he was long troubled with a malignant ulcer under the nose.\nHe was injudiciously advised to get rid of it by the use of extract of\nlead, which proved effectual; but from that time the Dauphin, who was\ncorpulent, insensibly grew thin, and a short, dry cough evinced that the\nhumour, driven in, had fallen on the lungs.  Some persons also suspected\nhim of having taken acids in too great a quantity for the purpose of\nreducing his bulk.  The state of his health was not, however, such as to\nexcite alarm.  At the camp at Compiegne, in July, 1764, the Dauphin\nreviewed the troops, and evinced much activity in the performance of his\nduties; it was even observed that he was seeking to gain the attachment\nof the army.  He presented the Dauphiness to the soldiers, saying, with a\nsimplicity which at that time made a great sensation, ’Mes enfans, here\nis my wife.’  Returning late on horseback to Compiegne, he found he had\ntaken a chill; the heat of the day had been excessive; the Prince’s\nclothes had been wet with perspiration.  An illness followed, in which\nthe Prince began to spit blood.  His principal physician wished to have\nhim bled; the consulting physicians insisted on purgation, and their\nadvice was followed.  The pleurisy, being ill cured, assumed and retained\nall the symptoms of consumption; the Dauphin languished from that period\nuntil December, 1765, and died at Fontainebleau, where the Court, on\naccount of his condition, had prolonged its stay, which usually ended on\nthe 2d of November.",
        "“The Dauphiness, his widow, was deeply afflicted; but the immoderate\ndespair which characterised her grief induced many to suspect that the\nloss of the crown was an important part of the calamity she lamented.\nShe long refused to eat enough to support life; she encouraged her tears\nto flow by placing portraits of the Dauphin in every retired part of her\napartments.  She had him represented pale, and ready to expire, in a\npicture placed at the foot of her bed, under draperies of gray cloth,\nwith which the chambers of the Princesses were always hung in court\nmournings.  Their grand cabinet was hung with black cloth, with an\nalcove, a canopy, and a throne, on which they received compliments of\ncondolence after the first period of the deep mourning.  The Dauphiness,\nsome months before the end of her career, regretted her conduct in\nabridging it; but it was too late; the fatal blow had been struck.  It\nmay also be presumed that living with a consumptive, man had contributed\nto her complaint.  This Princess had no opportunity of displaying her\nqualities; living in a Court in which she was eclipsed by the King and\nQueen, the only characteristics that could be remarked in her were her\nextreme attachment to her husband, and her great piety.",
        "“The Dauphin was little known, and his character has been much mistaken.\nHe himself, as he confessed to his intimate friends, sought to disguise\nit.  He one day asked one of his most familiar servants, ’What do they\nsay in Paris of that great fool of a Dauphin?’ The person interrogated\nseeming confused, the Dauphin urged him to express himself sincerely,\nsaying, ’Speak freely; that is positively the idea which I wish people to\nform of me.’",
        "“As he died of a disease which allows the last moment to be anticipated\nlong beforehand, he wrote much, and transmitted his affections and his\nprejudices to his son by secret notes.",
        "“Madame de Pompadour’s brother received Letters of Nobility from his\nMajesty, and was appointed superintendent of the buildings and gardens.\nHe often presented to her Majesty, through the medium of his sister, the\nrarest flowers, pineapples, and early vegetables from the gardens of\nTrianon and Choisy.  One day, when the Marquise came into the Queen’s\napartments, carrying a large basket of flowers, which she held in her two\nbeautiful arms, without gloves, as a mark of respect, the Queen loudly\ndeclared her admiration of her beauty; and seemed as if she wished to\ndefend the King’s choice, by praising her various charms in detail, in a\nmanner that would have been as suitable to a production of the fine arts\nas to a living being.  After applauding the complexion, eyes, and fine\narms of the favourite, with that haughty condescension which renders\napprobation more offensive than flattering, the Queen at length requested\nher to sing, in the attitude in which she stood, being desirous of\nhearing the voice and musical talent by which the King’s Court had been\ncharmed in the performances of the private apartments, and thus combining\nthe gratification of the ears with that of the eyes.  The Marquise, who\nstill held her enormous basket, was perfectly sensible of something\noffensive in this request, and tried to excuse herself from singing.  The\nQueen at last commanded her; she then exerted her fine voice in the solo\nof Armida–’At length he is in my power.’ The change in her Majesty’s\ncountenance was so obvious that the ladies present at this scene had the\ngreatest difficulty to keep theirs.",
        "“The Queen was affable and modest; but the more she was thankful in her\nheart to Heaven for having placed her on the first throne in Europe, the\nmore unwilling she was to be reminded of her elevation.  This sentiment\ninduced her to insist on the observation of all the forms of respect due\nto royal birth; whereas in other princes the consciousness of that birth\noften induces them to disdain the ceremonies of etiquette, and to prefer\nhabits of ease and simplicity.  There was a striking contrast in this\nrespect between Maria Leczinska and Marie Antoinette, as has been justly\nand generally observed.  The latter unfortunate Queen, perhaps, carried\nher disregard of everything belonging to the strict forms of etiquette\ntoo far.  One day, when the Marechale de Mouchy was teasing her with\nquestions relative to the extent to which she would allow the ladies the\noption of taking off or wearing their cloaks, and of pinning up the\nlappets of their caps, or letting them hang down, the Queen replied to\nher, in my presence: ’Arrange all those matters, madame, just as you\nplease; but do not imagine that a queen, born Archduchess of Austria, can\nattach that importance to them which might be felt by a Polish princess\nwho had become Queen of France.’",
        "“The virtues and information of the great are always evinced by their\nconduct; their accomplishments, coming within the scope of flattery, are\ndifficult to be ascertained by any authentic proofs, and those who have\nlived near them may be excused for some degree of scepticism with regard\nto their attainments of this kind.  If they draw or paint, there is\nalways an able artist present, who, if he does not absolutely guide the\npencil with his own hand, directs it by his advice.  If a princess\nattempt a piece of embroidery in colours, of that description which ranks\namongst the productions of the arts, a skilful embroideress is employed\nto undo and repair whatever has been spoilt.  If the princess be a\nmusician, there are no ears that will discover when she is out of tune;\nat least there is no tongue that will tell her so.  This imperfection in\nthe accomplishments of the great is but a slight misfortune.  It is\nsufficiently meritorious in them to engage in such pursuits, even with\nindifferent success, because this taste and the protection it extends\nproduce abundance of talent on every side.  Maria Leczinska delighted in\nthe art of painting, and imagined she herself could draw and paint.  She\nhad a drawing-master, who passed all his time in her cabinet.  She\nundertook to paint four large Chinese pictures, with which she wished to\nornament her private drawing-room, which was richly furnished with rare\nporcelain and the finest marbles.  This painter was entrusted with the\nlandscape and background of the pictures; he drew the figures with a\npencil; the faces and arms were also left by the Queen to his execution;\nshe reserved to herself nothing but the draperies, and the least\nimportant accessories.  The Queen every morning filled up the outline\nmarked out for her, with a little red, blue, or green colour, which the\nmaster prepared on the palette, and even filled her brush with,\nconstantly repeating, ’Higher up, Madame–lower down, Madame–a little to\nthe right–more to the left.’ After an hour’s work, the time for hearing\nmass, or some other family or pious duty, would interrupt her Majesty;\nand the painter, putting the shadows into the draperies she had painted,\nsoftening off the colour where she had laid too much, etc., finished the\nsmall figures.  When the work was completed the private drawing-room was\ndecorated with her Majesty’s work; and the firm persuasion of this good\nQueen that she had painted it herself was so entire that she left this\ncabinet, with all its furniture and paintings, to the Comtesse de\nNoailles, her lady of honour.  She added to the bequest: ’The pictures in\nmy cabinet being my own work, I hope the Comtesse de Noailles will\npreserve them for my sake.’  Madame de Noailles, afterwards Marechale de\nMouchy, had a new pavilion constructed in her hotel in the Faubourg St.\nGermain, in order to form a suitable receptacle for the Queen’s legacy;\nand had the following inscription placed over the door, in letters of\ngold: ’The innocent falsehood of a good princess.’",
        "“Maria Leczinska could never look with cordiality on the Princess of\nSaxony, who married the Dauphin; but the attentive behaviour of the\nDauphiness at length made her Majesty forget that the Princess was the\ndaughter of a king who wore her father’s crown.  Nevertheless, although\nthe Queen now saw in the Princess of Saxony only a wife beloved by her\nson, she never could forget that Augustus wore the crown of Stanislaus.\nOne day an officer of her chamber having undertaken to ask a private\naudience of her for the Saxon minister, and the Queen being unwilling to\ngrant it, he ventured to add that he should not have presumed to ask this\nfavour of the Queen had not the minister been the ambassador of a member\nof the family.  ’Say of an enemy of the family,’ replied the Queen,\nangrily; ’and let him come in.’",
        "“Comte de Tesse, father of the last Count of that name, who left no\nchildren, was first equerry to Queen Maria Leczinska.  She esteemed his\nvirtues, but often diverted herself at the expense of his simplicity.\nOne day, when the conversation turned on the noble military, actions by\nwhich the French nobility was distinguished, the Queen said to the Count:\n’And your family, M. de Tesse, has been famous, too, in the field.’–\n’Ah, Madame, we have all been killed in our masters’ service!’–’How\nrejoiced I am,’ replied the Queen, ’that you have revived to tell me of\nit.’  The son of this worthy M. de Tesse was married to the amiable and\nhighly gifted daughter of the Duc d’Ayen, afterwards Marechale de\nNoailles.  He was exceedingly fond of his daughter-in-law, and never\ncould speak of her without emotion.  The Queen, to please him, often\ntalked to him about the young Countess, and one day asked him which of\nher good qualities seemed to him most conspicuous.  ’Her gentleness,\nMadame, her gentleness,’ said he, with tears in his eyes; ’she is so\nmild, so soft,–as soft as a good carriage.’–’Well,’ said her Majesty,\n’that’s an excellent comparison for a first equerry.’",
        "“In 1730 Queen Maria Leczinska, going to mass, met old Marechal Villars,\nleaning on a wooden crutch not worth fifteen pence.  She rallied him\nabout it, and the Marshal told her that he had used it ever since he had\nreceived a wound which obliged him to add this article to the equipments\nof the army.  Her Majesty, smiling, said she thought this crutch so\nunworthy of him that she hoped to induce him to give it up.  On returning\nhome she despatched M. Campan to Paris with orders to purchase at the\ncelebrated Germain’s the handsomest cane, with a gold enamelled crutch,\nthat he could find, and carry it without delay to Mardchal Villars’s\nhotel, and present it to him from her.  He was announced accordingly, and\nfulfilled his commission.  The Marshal, in attending him to the door,\nrequested him to express his gratitude to the Queen, and said that he had\nnothing fit to offer to an officer who had the honour to belong to her\nMajesty; but he begged him to accept of his old stick, saying that his\ngrandchildren would probably some day be glad to possess the cane with\nwhich he had commanded at Marchiennes and Denain.  The known frugality of\nMarechal Villars appears in this anecdote; but he was not mistaken with\nrespect to the estimation in which his stick would be held.  It was\nthenceforth kept with veneration by M. Campan’s family.  On the 10th of\nAugust, 1792, a house which I occupied on the Carrousel, at the entrance\nof the Court of the Tuileries, was pillaged and nearly burnt down.  The\ncane of Marechal Villars was thrown into the Carrousel as of no value,\nand picked up by my servant.  Had its old master been living at that\nperiod we should not have witnessed such a deplorable day.",
        "“Before the Revolution there were customs and words in use at Versailles\nwith which few people were acquainted.  The King’s dinner was called\n’The King’s meat.’  Two of the Body Guard accompanied the attendants who\ncarried the dinner; every one rose as they passed through the halls,\nsaying, ’There is the King’s meat.’  All precautionary duties were\ndistinguished by the words ’in case.’  One of the guards might be heard\nto say, ’I am in case in the forest of St. Germain.’  In the evening they\nalways brought the Queen a large bowl of broth, a cold roast fowl, one\nbottle of wine, one of orgeat, one of lemonade, and some other articles,\nwhich were called the ’in case’ for the night.  An old medical gentleman,\nwho had been physician in ordinary to Louis XIV., and was still living at\nthe time of the marriage of Louis XV., told M. Campan’s father an\nanecdote which seems too remarkable to have remained unknown;\nnevertheless he was a man of honour, incapable of inventing this story.\nHis name was Lafosse.  He said that Louis XIV. was informed that the\nofficers of his table evinced, in the most disdainful and offensive\nmanner, the mortification they felt at being obliged to eat at the table\nof the comptroller of the kitchen along with Moliere, valet de chambre to\nhis Majesty, because Moliere had performed on the stage; and that this\ncelebrated author consequently declined appearing at that table.  Louis\nXIV., determined to put an end to insults which ought never to have been\noffered to one of the greatest geniuses of the age, said to him one\nmorning at the hour of his private levee, ’They say you live very poorly\nhere, Moliere; and that the officers of my chamber do not find you good\nenough to eat with them.  Perhaps you are hungry; for my part I awoke\nwith a very good appetite this morning: sit down at this table.  Serve up\nmy ’in case’ for the night there.’  The King, then cutting up his fowl,\nand ordering Moliere to sit down, helped him to a wing, at the same time\ntaking one for himself, and ordered the persons entitled to familiar\nentrance, that is to say the most distinguished and favourite people at\nCourt, to be admitted.  ’You see me,’ said the King to them, ’engaged in\nentertaining Moliere, whom my valets de chambre do not consider\nsufficiently good company for them.’  From that time Moliere never had\noccasion to appear at the valets’ table; the whole Court was forward\nenough to send him invitations.",
        "“M. de Lafosse used also to relate that a brigade-major of the Body\nGuard, being ordered to place the company in the little theatre at\nVersailles, very roughly turned out one of the King’s comptrollers who\nhad taken his seat on one of the benches, a place to which his newly\nacquired office entitled him.  In vain he insisted on his quality and his\nright.  The altercation was ended by the brigade-major in these words:\n’Gentlemen Body Guards, do your duty.’  In this case their duty was to\nturn the offender out at the door.  This comptroller, who had paid sixty\nor eighty thousand francs for his appointment, was a man of a good\nfamily, and had had the honour of serving his Majesty five and twenty\nyears in one of his regiments; thus ignominiously driven out of the hall,\nhe placed himself in the King’s way in the great hall of the Guards, and,\nbowing to his Majesty, requested him to vindicate the honour of an old\nsoldier who had wished to end his days in his Prince’s civil employment,\nnow that age had obliged him to relinquish his military service.  The\nKing stopped, heard his story, and then ordered him to follow him.  His\nMajesty attended the representation in a sort of amphitheatre, in which\nhis armchair was placed; behind him was a row of stools for the captain\nof the Guards, the first gentleman of the chamber, and other great\nofficers.  The brigade-major was entitled to one of these places; the\nKing stopped opposite the seat which ought to have been occupied by that\nofficer and said to the comptroller, ’Take, monsieur, for this evening,\nthe place near my person of him who has offended you, and let the\nexpression of my displeasure at this unjust affront satisfy you instead\nof any other reparation:",
        "“During the latter years of the reign of Louis XIV. he never went out but\nin a chair carried by porters, and he showed a great regard for a man\nnamed D’Aigremont, one of those porters who always went in front and\nopened the door of the chair.  The slightest preference shown by\nsovereigns, even to the meanest of their servants, never fails to excite\nobservation.",
        "     [People of the very first rank did not disdain to descend to the\n     level of D’Aigremont.  “Lauzun,” said the Duchesse d’Orleans in her\n     “Memoirs,” “sometimes affects stupidity in order to show people\n     their own with impunity, for he is very malicious.  In order to make\n     Marechal de Tease feel the impropriety of his familiarity with\n     people of the common sort, he called out, in the drawing-room at\n     Marly, ’Marechal, give me a pinch of snuff; some of your best, such\n     as you take in the morning with Monsieur d’Aigremont, the\n     chairman.’\"–NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]",
        "The King had done something for this man’s numerous family, and\nfrequently talked to him.  An abbe belonging to the chapel thought proper\nto request D’Aigremont to present a memorial to the King, in which he\nrequested his Majesty to grant him a benefice.  Louis XIV.  did not\napprove of the liberty thus taken by his chairman, and said to him, in a\nvery angry tone, ’D’Aigremont, you have been made to do a very unbecoming\nact, and I am sure there must be simony in the case.’–’No, Sire, there\nis not the least ceremony in the case, I assure you,’ answered the poor\nman, in great consternation; ’the abbe only said he would give me a\nhundred Louis.’–’D’Aigremont,’ said the King, ’I forgive you on account\nof your ignorance and candour.  I will give you the hundred Louis out of\nmy privy purse; but I will discharge you the very next time you venture\nto present a memorial to me.’",
        "“Louis XIV. was very kind to those of his servants who were nearest his\nperson; but the moment he assumed his royal deportment, those who were\nmost accustomed to see him in his domestic character were as much\nintimidated as if they were appearing in his presence for the first time\nin their lives.  Some of the members of his Majesty’s civil household,\nthen called ’commensalite’, enjoying the title of equerry, and the\nprivileges attached to officers of the King’s household, had occasion to\nclaim some prerogatives, the exercise of which the municipal body of St.\nGermain, where they resided, disputed with them.  Being assembled in\nconsiderable numbers in that town, they obtained the consent of the\nminister of the household to allow them to send a deputation to the King;\nand for that purpose chose from amongst them two of his Majesty’s valets\nde chambre named Bazire and Soulaigre.  The King’s levee being over, the\ndeputation of the inhabitants of the town of St. Germain was called in.\nThey entered with confidence; the King looked at them, and assumed his\nimposing attitude.  Bazire, one of these valets de chambre, was about to\nspeak, but Louis the Great was looking on him.  He no longer saw the\nPrince he was accustomed to attend at home; he was intimidated, and could\nnot find words; he recovered, however, and began as usual with the word\nSire.  But timidity again overpowered him, and finding himself unable to\nrecollect the slightest particle of what he came to say, he repeated the\nword Sire several times, and at length concluded by paying, ’Sire, here\nis Soulaigre.’  Soulaigre, who was very angry with Bazire, and expected\nto acquit himself much better, then began to speak; but he also, after\nrepeating ’Sire’ several times, found his embarrassment increasing upon\nhim, until his confusion equalled that of his colleague; he therefore\nended with ’Sire, here is Bazire.’  The King smiled, and answered,\n’Gentlemen, I have been informed of the business upon which you have been\ndeputed to wait on me, and I will take care that what is right shall be\ndone.  I am highly satisfied with the manner in which you have fulfilled\nyour functions as deputies.’”",
        "Mademoiselle Genet’s education was the object of her father’s particular\nattention.  Her progress in the study of music and of foreign languages\nwas surprising; Albaneze instructed her in singing, and Goldoni taught\nher Italian.  Tasso, Milton, Dante, and even Shakespeare, soon became\nfamiliar to her.  But her studies were particularly directed to the\nacquisition of a correct and elegant style of reading.  Rochon de\nChabannes, Duclos, Barthe, Marmontel, and Thomas took pleasure in hearing\nher recite the finest scenes of Racine.  Her memory and genius at the age\nof fourteen charmed them; they talked of her talents in society, and\nperhaps applauded them too highly.",
        "She was soon spoken of at Court.  Some ladies of high rank, who took an\ninterest in the welfare of her family, obtained for her the place of\nReader to the Princesses.  Her presentation, and the circumstances which\npreceded it, left a strong impression on her mind.  “I was then fifteen,\"\nshe says; “my father felt some regret at yielding me up at so early an\nage to the jealousies of the Court.  The day on which I first put on my\nCourt dress, and went to embrace him in his study, tears filled his eyes,\nand mingled with the expression of his pleasure.  I possessed some\nagreeable talents, in addition to the instruction which it had been his\ndelight to bestow on me.  He enumerated all my little accomplishments, to\nconvince me of the vexations they would not fail to draw upon me.”",
        "Mademoiselle Genet, at fifteen, was naturally less of a philosopher than\nher father was at forty.  Her eyes were dazzled by the splendour which\nglittered at Versailles.  “The Queen, Maria Leczinska, the wife of Louis\nXV., died,” she says, “just before I was presented at Court.  The grand\napartments hung with black, the great chairs of state, raised on several\nsteps, and surmounted by a canopy adorned with Plumes; the caparisoned\nhorses, the immense retinue in Court mourning, the enormous shoulder-\nknots, embroidered with gold and silver spangles, which decorated the\ncoats of the pages and footmen,–all this magnificence had such an effect\non my senses that I could scarcely support myself when introduced to the\nPrincesses.  The first day of my reading in the inner apartment of Madame\nVictoire I found it impossible to pronounce more than two sentences; my\nheart palpitated, my voice faltered, and my sight failed.  How well\nunderstood was the potent magic of the grandeur and dignity which ought\nto surround sovereigns!  Marie Antoinette, dressed in white, with a plain\nstraw hat, and a little switch in her hand, walking on foot, followed by\na single servant, through the walks leading to the Petit Trianon, would\nnever have thus disconcerted me; and I believe this extreme simplicity\nwas the first and only real mistake of all those with which she is\nreproached.”",
        "When once her awe and confusion had subsided, Mademoiselle Genet was\nenabled to form a more accurate judgment of her situation.  It was by no\nmeans attractive; the Court of the Princesses, far removed from the\nrevels to which Louie XV. was addicted, was grave, methodical, and dull.\nMadame Adelaide, the eldest of the Princesses, lived secluded in the\ninterior of her apartments; Madame Sophie was haughty; Madame Louise a\ndevotee.  Mademoiselle Genet never quitted the Princesses’ apartments;\nbut she attached herself most particularly to Madame Victoire.  This\nPrincess had possessed beauty; her countenance bore an expression of\nbenevolence, and her conversation was kind, free, and unaffected.  The\nyoung reader excited in her that feeling which a woman in years, of an\naffectionate disposition, readily extends to young people who are growing\nup in her sight, and who possess some useful talents.  Whole days were\npassed in reading to the Princess, as she sat at work in her apartment.\nMademoiselle Genet frequently saw there Louis XV., of whom she has\nrelated the following anecdote:",
        "“One day, at the Chateau of Compiegne, the King came in whilst I was\nreading to Madame.  I rose and went into another room.  Alone, in an\napartment from which there was no outlet, with no book but a Massillon,\nwhich I had been reading to the Princess, happy in all the lightness and\ngaiety of fifteen, I amused myself with turning swiftly round, with my\ncourt hoop, and suddenly kneeling down to see my rose-coloured silk\npetticoat swelled around me by the wind.  In the midst of this grave\nemployment enters his Majesty, followed by one of the Princesses.  I\nattempt to rise; my feet stumble, and down I fall in the midst of my\nrobes, puffed out by the wind.  ’Daughter,’ said Louis XV., laughing\nheartily, ’I advise you to send back to school a reader who makes\ncheeses.’”  The railleries of Louis XV. were often much more cutting,\nas Mademoiselle Genet experienced on another occasion, which, thirty\nyears afterwards, she could not relate without an emotion of fear.\n\"Louis XV.,” she said, “had the most imposing presence.  His eyes\nremained fixed upon you all the time he was speaking; and,\nnotwithstanding the beauty of his features, he inspired a sort of fear.\nI was very young, it is true, when he first spoke to me; you shall judge\nwhether it was in a very gracious manner.  I was fifteen.  The King was\ngoing out to hunt, and a numerous retinue followed him.  As he stopped\nopposite me he said, ’Mademoiselle Genet, I am assured you are very\nlearned, and understand four or five foreign languages.’–’I know only\ntwo, Sire,’ I answered, trembling.  ’Which are they?’ English and\nItalian.’–’Do you speak them fluently?’ Yes, Sire, very fluently.’\n’That is quite enough to drive a husband mad.’  After this pretty\ncompliment the King went on; the retinue saluted me, laughing; and, for\nmy part, I remained for some moments motionless with surprise and\nconfusion.”",
        "At the time when the French alliance was proposed by the Duc de Choiseul\nthere was at Vienna a doctor named Gassner,–[Jean Joseph Gassner, a\npretender to miraculous powers.]–who had fled thither to seek an asylum\nagainst the persecutions of his sovereign, one of the ecclesiastical\nelectors.  Gassner, gifted with an extraordinary warmth of imagination,\nimagined that he received inspirations.  The Empress protected him, saw\nhim occasionally, rallied him on his visions, and, nevertheless, heard\nthem with a sort of interest.  “Tell me,\"–said she to him one day,\n\"whether my Antoinette will be happy.”  Gassner turned pale, and remained\nsilent.  Being still pressed by the Empress, and wishing to give a\ngeneral expression to the idea with which he seemed deeply occupied,\n\"Madame,” he replied, “there are crosses for all shoulders.”",
        "The occurrences at the Place Louis XV. on the marriage festivities at\nParis are generally known.  The conflagration of the scaffolds intended\nfor the fireworks, the want of foresight of the authorities, the avidity\nof robbers, the murderous career of the coaches, brought about and\naggravated the disasters of that day; and the young Dauphiness, coming\nfrom Versailles, by the Cours la Reine, elated with joy, brilliantly\ndecorated, and eager to witness the rejoicings of the whole people, fled,\nstruck with consternation and drowned in tears, from the dreadful scene.\nThis tragic opening of the young Princess’s life in France seemed to bear\nout Gassner’s hint of disaster, and to be ominous of the terrible future\nwhich awaited her.",
        "In the same year in which Marie Antoinette was married to the Dauphin,\nHenriette Genet married a son of M. Campan, already mentioned as holding\nan office at the Court; and when the household of the Dauphiness was\nformed, Madame Campan was appointed her reader, and received from Marie\nAntoinette a consistent kindness and confidence to which by her loyal\nservice she was fully entitled.   Madame Campan’s intelligence and\nvivacity made her much more sympathetic to a young princess, gay and\naffectionate in disposition, and reared in the simplicity of a German\nCourt, than her lady of honour, the Comtesse de Noailles.  This\nrespectable lady, who was placed near her as a minister of the laws of\netiquette, instead of alleviating their weight, rendered their yoke\nintolerable to her.",
        "“Madame de Noailles,” says Madame Campan, “abounded in virtues.  Her\npiety, charity, and irreproachable morals rendered her worthy of praise;\nbut etiquette was to her a sort of atmosphere; at the slightest\nderangement of the consecrated order, one would have thought the\nprinciples of life would forsake her frame.",
        "“One day I unintentionally threw this poor lady into a terrible agony.\nThe Queen was receiving I know not whom,–some persons just presented, I\nbelieve; the lady of honour, the Queen’s tirewoman, and the ladies of the\nbedchamber, were behind the Queen.  I was near the throne, with the two\nwomen on duty.  All was right,–at least I thought so.  Suddenly I\nperceived the eyes of Madame de Noailles fixed on mine.  She made a sign\nwith her head, and then raised her eyebrows to the top of her forehead,\nlowered them, raised them again, then began to make little signs with her\nhand.  From all this pantomime, I could easily perceive that something\nwas not as it should be; and as I looked about on all sides to find out\nwhat it was, the agitation of the Countess kept increasing.  The Queen,\nwho perceived all this, looked at me with a smile; I found means to\napproach her Majesty, who said to me in a whisper, ’Let down your\nlappets, or the Countess will expire.’  All this bustle arose from two\nunlucky pins which fastened up my lappets, whilst the etiquette of\ncostume said ’Lappets hanging down.’”",
        "Her contempt of the vanities of etiquette became the pretext for the\nfirst reproaches levelled at the Queen.  What misconduct might not be\ndreaded from a princess who could absolutely go out without a hoop! and\nwho, in the salons of Trianon, instead of discussing the important rights\nto chairs and stools, good-naturedly invited everybody to be seated.",
        "     [M. de Fresne Forget, being one day in company with the Queen\n     Marguerite, told her he was astonished how men and women with such\n     great ruffs could eat soup without spoiling them; and still more how\n     the ladies could be gallant with their great fardingales.  The Queen\n     made no answer at that time, but a few days after, having a very\n     large ruff on, and some ’bouili’ to eat, she ordered a very long\n     spoon to be brought, and ate her ’bouili’ with it, without soiling\n     her ruff.  Upon which, addressing herself to M. de Fresne, she said,\n     laughing, “There now, you see, with a little ingenuity one may\n     manage anything.\"–\"Yes, faith, madame,” said the good man, “as far\n     as regards the soup I am satisfied.\"–LAPLACE’s “Collection,” vol.\n     ii., p. 350.]",
        "The anti-Austrian party, discontented and vindictive, became spies upon\nher conduct, exaggerated her slightest errors, and calumniated her most\ninnocent proceedings.  “What seems unaccountable at the first glance,\"\nsays Montjoie, “is that the first attack on the reputation of the Queen\nproceeded from the bosom of the Court.  What interest could the courtiers\nhave in seeking her destruction, which involved that of the King?  Was it\nnot drying up the source of all the advantages they enjoyed, or could\nhope for?”",
        "     [Madame Campan relates the following among many anecdotes\n     illustrative of the Queen’s kindness of heart: “A petition was\n     addressed to the Queen by a corporation in the neighbourhood of\n     Paris, praying for the destruction of the game which destroyed their\n     crops.  I was the bearer of this petition to her Majesty, who said,\n     ’I will undertake to have these good people relieved from so great\n     an annoyance.’  She gave the document to M. de Vermond in my\n     presence, saying, ’I desire that immediate justice be done to this\n     petition.’  An assurance was given that her order should be attended\n     to, but six weeks afterwards a second petition was sent up, for the\n     nuisance had not been abated after all.  If the second petition had\n     reached the Queen, M. de Vermond would have received a sharp\n     reprimand.  She was always so happy when it was in her power to do\n     good.”",
        "     The quick repartee, which was another of the Queen’s\n     characteristics, was less likely to promote her popularity.  “M.\n     Brunier,” says Madame Campan, “was physician to the royal children.\n     During his visits to the palace, if the death of any of his patients\n     was alluded to, he never failed to say, ’Ah! there I lost one of my\n     best friends!  ’Well,’ said the Queen, ’if he loses all his patients\n     who are his friends, what will become of those who are not?’\"]",
        "When the terrible Danton exclaimed, “The kings of Europe menace us; it\nbehooves us to defy them; let us throw down to them the head of a king as\nour gage!” these detestable words, followed by so cruel a result, formed,\nhowever, a formidable stroke of policy.  But the Queen!  What urgent\nreasons of state could Danton, Collot d’Herbois, and Robespierre allege\nagainst her?  What savage greatness did they discover in stirring up a\nwhole nation to avenge their quarrel on a woman?  What remained of her\nformer power?  She was a captive, a widow, trembling for her children!\nIn those judges, who at once outraged modesty and nature; in that people\nwhose vilest scoffs pursued her to the scaffold, who could have\nrecognised the generous people of France?  Of all the crimes which\ndisgraced the Revolution, none was more calculated to show how the spirit\nof party can degrade the character of a nation.",
        "The news of this dreadful event reached Madame Campan in an obscure\nretreat which she had chosen.  She had not succeeded in her endeavours to\nshare the Queen’s captivity, and she expected every moment a similar\nfate.  After escaping, almost miraculously, from the murderous fury of\nthe Marseillais; after being denounced and pursued by Robespierre, and\nentrusted, through the confidence of the King and Queen, with papers of\nthe utmost importance, Madame Campan went to Coubertin, in the valley of\nChevreuse.  Madame Auguid, her sister, had just committed suicide, at the\nvery moment of her arrest.",
        "     [Maternal affection prevailed over her religious sentiments; she\n     wished to preserve the wreck of her fortune for her children.  Had\n     she deferred this fatal act for one day she would have been saved;\n     the cart which conveyed Robespierre to execution stopped her funeral\n     procession!]",
        "The scaffold awaited Madame Campan, when the 9th of Thermidor restored\nher to life; but did not restore to her the most constant object of her\nthoughts, her zeal, and her devotion.",
        "A new career now opened to Madame Campan.  At Coubertin, surrounded by\nher nieces, she was fond of directing their studies.  This occupation\ncaused her ideas to revert to the subject of education, and awakened once\nmore the inclinations of her youth.  At the age of twelve years she could\nnever meet a school of young ladies passing through the streets without\nfeeling ambitious of the situation and authority of their mistress.  Her\nabode at Court had diverted but not altered her inclinations.  “A month\nafter the fall of Robespierre,” she says, “I considered as to the means\nof providing for myself, for a mother seventy years of age, my sick\nhusband, my child nine years old, and part of my ruined family.  I now\npossessed nothing in the world but an assignat of five hundred francs.\nI had become responsible for my husband’s debts, to the amount of thirty\nthousand francs.  I chose St. Germain to set up a boarding-school, for\nthat town did not remind me, as Versailles did, both of happy times and\nof the misfortunes of France.  I took with me a nun of l’Enfant-Jesus, to\ngive an unquestionable pledge of my religious principles.  The school of\nSt. Germain was the first in which the opening of an oratory was ventured\non.  The Directory was displeased at it, and ordered it to be immediately\nshut up; and some time after commissioners were sent to desire that the\nreading of the Scriptures should be suppressed in my school.  I inquired\nwhat books were to be substituted in their stead.  After some minutes’\nconversation, they observed: ’Citizeness, you are arguing after the old\nfashion; no reflections.  The nation commands; we must have obedience,\nand no reasoning.’  Not having the means of printing my prospectus, I\nwrote a hundred copies of it, and sent them to the persons of my\nacquaintance who had survived the dreadful commotions.  At the year’s end\nI had sixty pupils; soon afterwards a hundred.  I bought furniture and\npaid my debts.”",
        "The rapid success of the establishment at St. Germain was undoubtedly\nowing to the talents, experience, and excellent principles of Madame\nCampan, seconded by public opinion.  All property had changed hands; all\nranks found themselves confusedly jumbled by the shock of the Revolution:\nthe grand seigneur dined at the table of the opulent contractor; and the\nwitty and elegant marquise was present at the ball by the side of the\nclumsy peasant lately grown rich.  In the absence of the ancient\ndistinctions, elegant manners and polished language now formed a kind of\naristocracy.  The house of St. Germain, conducted by a lady who possessed\nthe deportment and the habits of the best society, was not only a school\nof knowledge, but a school of the world.",
        "“A friend of Madame de Beauharnais,” continues Madame Campan, “brought me\nher daughter Hortense de Beauharnais, and her niece Emilie de\nBeauharnais.  Six months afterwards she came to inform me of her marriage\nwith a Corsican gentleman, who had been brought up in the military\nschool, and was then a general.  I was requested to communicate this\ninformation to her daughter, who long lamented her mother’s change of\nname.  I was also desired to watch over the education of little Eugene de\nBeauharnais, who was placed at St. Germain, in the same school with my\nson.",
        "“A great intimacy sprang up between my nieces and these young people.\nMadame de Beauharnaias set out for Italy, and left her children with me.\nOn her return, after the conquests of Bonaparte, that general, much\npleased with the improvement of his stepdaughter, invited me to dine at\nMalmaison, and attended two representations of ’Esther’ at my school.”",
        "He also showed his appreciation of her talents by sending his sister\nCaroline to St. Germain.  Shortly before Caroline’s marriage to Murat,\nand while she was yet at St. Germain, Napoleon observed to Madame Campan:\n\"I do not like those love matches between young people whose brains are\nexcited by the flames of the imagination.  I had other views for my\nsister.  Who knows what high alliance I might have procured for her!  She\nis thoughtless, and does not form a just notion of my situation.  The\ntime will come when, perhaps, sovereigns might dispute for her hand.  She\nis about to marry a brave man; but in my situation that is not enough.\nFate should be left to fulfil her decrees.”",
        "     [Madame Murat one day said to Madame Campan: “I am astonished that\n     you are not more awed in our presence; you speak to us with as much\n     familiarity as when we were your pupils!\"–\"The best thing you can\n     do,” replied Madame Campan, “is to forget your titles when you are\n     with me, for I can never be afraid of queens whom I have held under\n     the rod.\"]",
        "Madame Campan dined at the Tuileries in company with the Pope’s nuncio,\nat the period when the Concordat was in agitation.  During dinner the\nFirst Consul astonished her by the able manner in which he conversed on\nthe subject under discussion.  She said he argued so logically that his\ntalent quite amazed her.  During the consulate Napoleon one day said to\nher, “If ever I establish a republic of women, I shall make you First\nConsul.”",
        "Napoleon’s views as to “woman’s mission” are now well known.  Madame\nCampan said that she heard from him that when he founded the convent of\nthe Sisters of la Charite he was urgently solicited to permit perpetual\nvows.  He, however, refused to do so, on the ground that tastes may\nchange, and that he did not see the necessity of excluding from the world\nwomen who might some time or other return to it, and become useful\nmembers of society.  “Nunneries,” he added, “assail the very roots of\npopulation.  It is impossible to calculate the loss which a nation\nsustains in having ten thousand women shut up in cloisters.  War does but\nlittle mischief; for the number of males is at least one-twenty-fifth\ngreater than that of females.  Women may, if they please, be allowed to\nmake perpetual vows at fifty years of age; for then their task is\nfulfilled.”",
        "Napoleon once said to Madame Campan, “The old systems of education were\ngood for nothing; what do young women stand in need of, to be well\nbrought up in France?\"–\"Of mothers,” answered Madame Campan.  “It is\nwell said,” replied Napoleon.  “Well, madame, let the French be indebted\nto you for bringing up mothers for their children.\"–\"Napoleon one day\ninterrupted Madame de Stael in the midst of a profound political argument\nto ask her whether she had nursed her children.”",
        "Never had the establishment at St. Germain been in a more flourishing\ncondition than in 1802-3.  What more could Madame Campan wish?  For ten\nyears absolute in her own house, she seemed also safe from the caprice of\npower.  But the man who then disposed of the fate of France and Europe\nwas soon to determine otherwise.",
        "After the battle of Austerlitz the State undertook to bring up, at the\npublic expense, the sisters, daughters, or nieces of those who were\ndecorated with the Cross of Honour.  The children of the warriors killed\nor wounded in glorious battle were to find paternal care in the ancient\nabodes of the Montmorencys and the Condes.  Accustomed to concentrate\naround him all superior talents, fearless himself of superiority,\nNapoleon sought for a person qualified by experience and abilities to\nconduct the institution of Ecouen; he selected Madame Campan.",
        "Comte de Lacepede, the pupil, friend, and rival of Buffon, then Grand\nChancellor of the Legion of Honour, assisted her with his enlightened\nadvice.  Napoleon, who could descend with ease from the highest political\nsubjects to the examination of the most minute details; who was as much\nat home in inspecting a boarding-school for young ladies as in reviewing\nthe grenadiers of his guard; whom it was impossible to deceive, and who\nwas not unwilling to find fault when he visited the establishment at\nEcouen,–was forced to say, “It is all right.”",
        "     [Napoleon wished to be informed of every particular of the\n     furniture, government, and order of the house, the instruction and\n     education of the pupils.  The internal regulations were submitted to\n     him.  One of the intended rules, drawn up by Madame Campan, proposed\n     that the children should hear mass on Sundays and Thursdays.\n     Napoleon himself wrote on the margin, “every day.\"]",
        "“In the summer of 1811,\" relates Madame Campan, “Napoleon, accompanied by\nMarie Louise and several personages of distinction, visited the\nestablishment at Ecouen.  After inspecting the chapel and the\nrefectories, Napoleon desired that the three principal pupils might be\npresented to him.  ’Sire,’ said I, ’I cannot select three; I must present\nsix.’  He turned on his heel and repaired to the platform, where, after\nseeing all the classes assembled, he repeated his demand.  ’Sire,’ said\nI, ’I beg leave to inform your Majesty that I should commit an injustice\ntowards several other pupils who are as far advanced as those whom I\nmight have the honour to present to you.’",
        "“Berthier and others intimated to me, in a low tone of voice, that I\nshould get into disgrace by my noncompliance.  Napoleon looked over the\nwhole of the house, entered into the most trivial details, and after\naddressing questions to several of the pupils: ’Well, madame,’ said he,\n’I am satisfied; show me your six best pupils.’”  Madame Campan presented\nthem to him; and as he stepped into his carriage, he desired that their\nnames might be sent to Berthier.  On addressing the list to the Prince de\nNeufchatel, Madame Campan added to it the names of four other pupils, and\nall the ten obtained a pension of 300 francs.  During the three hours\nwhich this visit occupied, Marie Louise did not utter a single word.",
        "M. de Beaumont, chamberlain to the Empress Josephine, one day at\nMalmaison was expressing his regret that M. D––-, one of Napoleon’s\ngenerals, who had recently been promoted, did not belong to a great\nfamily.  “You mistake, monsieur,” observed Madame Campan, “he is of very\nancient descent; he is one of the nephews of Charlemagne.  All the heroes\nof our army sprang from the elder branch of that sovereign’s family, who\nnever emigrated.”",
        "When Madame Campan related this circumstance she added: “After the 30th\nof March, 1814, some officers of the army of Conde presumed to say to\ncertain French marshals that it was a pity they were not more nobly\nconnected.  In answer to this, one of them said, ’True nobility,\ngentlemen, consists in giving proofs of it.  The field of honour has\nwitnessed ours; but where are we to look for yours?  Your swords have\nrusted in their scabbards.  Our laurels may well excite envy; we have\nearned them nobly, and we owe them solely to our valour.  You have merely\ninherited a name.  This is the distinction between us.”",
        "     [When one of the princes of the smaller German States was showing\n     Marechal Lannes, with a contemptuous superiority of manner but ill\n     concealed, the portraits of his ancestors, and covertly alluding to\n     the absence of Lannes’s, that general turned the tables on him by\n     haughtily remarking, “But I am an ancestor.\"]",
        "Napoleon used to observe that if he had had two such field-marshals as\nSuchet in Spain he would have not only conquered but kept the Peninsula.\nSuchet’s sound judgment, his governing yet conciliating spirit, his\nmilitary tact, and his bravery, had procured him astonishing success.\n\"It is to be regretted,” added he, “that a sovereign cannot improvise men\nof his stamp.”",
        "On the 19th of March, 1815, a number of papers were left in the King’s\ncloset.  Napoleon ordered them to be examined, and among them was found\nthe letter written by Madame Campan to Louis XVIII., immediately after\nthe first restoration.  In this letter she enumerated the contents of the\nportfolio which Louis XVI. had placed under her care.  When Napoleon read\nthis letter, he said, “Let it be sent to the office of Foreign Affairs;\nit is an historical document.”",
        "Madame Campan thus described a visit from the Czar of Russia: “A few days\nafter the battle of Paris the Emperor Alexander came to Ecouen, and he\ndid me the honour to breakfast with me.  After showing him over the\nestablishment I conducted him to the park, the most elevated point of\nwhich overlooked the plain of St. Denis.  ’Sire,’ said I, ’from this\npoint I saw the battle of Paris’–’If,’ replied the Emperor, ’that battle\nhad lasted two hours longer we should not have had a single cartridge at\nour disposal.  We feared that we had been betrayed; for on arriving so\nprecipitately before Paris all our plans were laid, and we did not expect\nthe firm resistance we experienced.’  I next conducted the Emperor to the\nchapel, and showed him the seats occupied by ’le connetable’ (the\nconstable) of Montmorency, and ’la connetable’ (the constable’s lady),\nwhen they went to hear mass.  ’Barbarians like us,’ observed the Emperor,\n’would say la connetable and le connetable.’",
        "“The Czar inquired into the most minute particulars respecting the\nestablishment of Ecouen, and I felt great pleasure in answering his\nquestions.  I recollect having dwelt on several points which appeared to\nme to be very important, and which were in their spirit hostile to\naristocratic principles.  For example, I informed his Majesty that the\ndaughters of distinguished and wealthy individuals and those of the\nhumble and obscure mingled indiscriminately in the establishment.  ’If,’\nsaid I, ’I were to observe the least pretension on account of the rank or\nfortune of parents, I should immediately put an end to it.  The most\nperfect equality is preserved; distinction is awarded only to merit and\nindustry.  The pupils are obliged to cut out and make all their own\nclothes.  They are taught to clean and mend lace; and two at a time, they\nby turns, three times a week, cook and distribute food to the poor of the\nvillage.  The young girls who have been brought up at Ecouen, or in my\nboarding-school at St. Germain, are thoroughly acquainted with everything\nrelating to household business, and they are grateful to me for having\nmade that a part of their education.  In my conversations with them I\nhave always taught them that on domestic management depends the\npreservation or dissipation of their fortunes.’",
        "“The post-master of Ecouen was in the courtyard at the moment when the\nEmperor, as he stepped into his carriage, told me he would send some\nsweetmeats for the pupils.  I immediately communicated to them the\nintelligence, which was joyfully received; but the sweetmeats were looked\nfor in vain.  When Alexander set out for England he changed horses at\nEcouen, and the post-master said to him: ’Sire, the pupils of Ecouen are\nstill expecting the sweetmeats which your Majesty promised them.’  To\nwhich the Emperor replied that he had directed Saken to send them.  The\nCossacks had most likely devoured the sweetmeats, and the poor little\ngirls, who had been so highly flattered by the promise, never tasted\nthem.”",
        "“A second house was formed at St. Denis, on the model of that of Ecouen.\nPerhaps Madame Campan might have hoped for a title to which her long\nlabours gave her a right; perhaps the superintendence of the two houses\nwould have been but the fair recompense of her services; but her\nfortunate years had passed her fate was now to depend on the most\nimportant events.  Napoleon had accumulated such a mass of power as no\none but himself in Europe could overturn.  France, content with thirty\nyears of victories, in vain asked for peace and repose.  The army which\nhad triumphed in the sands of Egypt, on the summits of the Alps, and in\nthe marshes of Holland, was to perish amidst the snows of Russia.\nNations combined against a single man.  The territory of France was\ninvaded.  The orphans of Ecouen, from the windows of the mansion which\nserved as their asylum, saw in the distant plain the fires of the Russian\nbivouacs, and once more wept the deaths of their fathers.  Paris\ncapitulated.  France hailed the return of the descendants of Henri IV.;\nthey reascended the throne so long filled by their ancestors, which the\nwisdom of an enlightened prince established on the empire of the laws.",
        "     [A lady, connected with the establishment of St. Denis, told Madame\n     Campan that Napoleon visited it during the Hundred Days, and that\n     the pupils were so delighted to see him that they crowded round him,\n     endeavouring to touch his clothes, and evincing the most extravagant\n     joy.  The matron endeavoured to silence them; but Napoleon said,\n     ’Let them alone; let them alone.  This may weaken the head, but it\n     strengthens the heart.’\"]",
        "This moment, which diffused joy amongst the faithful servants of the\nroyal family, and brought them the rewards of their devotion, proved to\nMadame Campan a period of bitter vexation.  The hatred of her enemies had\nrevived.  The suppression of the school at Ecouen had deprived her of her\nposition; the most absurd calumnies followed her into her retreat; her\nattachment to the Queen was suspected; she was accused not only of\ningratitude but of perfidy.  Slander has little effect on youth, but in\nthe decline of life its darts are envenomed with a mortal poison.  The\nwounds which Madame Campan had received were deep.  Her sister, Madame\nAuguie, had destroyed herself; M. Rousseau, her brother-in-law, had\nperished, a victim of the reign of terror.  In 1813 a dreadful accident\nhad deprived her of her niece, Madame de Broc, one of the most amiable\nand interesting beings that ever adorned the earth.  Madame Campan seemed\ndestined to behold those whom she loved go down to the grave before her.",
        "Beyond the walls of the mansion of Ecouen, in the village which surrounds\nit, Madame Campan had taken a small house where she loved to pass a few\nhours in solitary retirement.  There, at liberty to abandon herself to\nthe memory of the past, the superintendent of the imperial establishment\nbecame, once more, for the moment, the first lady of the chamber to Marie\nAntoinette.  To the few friends whom she admitted into this retreat she\nwould show, with emotion, a plain muslin gown which the Queen had worn,\nand which was made from a part of Tippoo Saib’s present.  A cup, out of\nwhich Marie Antoinette had drunk; a writing-stand, which she had long\nused, were, in her eyes, of inestimable value; and she has often been\ndiscovered sitting, in tears, before the portrait of her royal mistress.",
        "After so many troubles Madame Campan sought a peaceful retreat.  Paris\nhad become odious to her.",
        "She paid a visit to one of her most beloved pupils, Mademoiselle Crouzet,\nwho had married a physician at Mantes, a man of talent, distinguished for\nhis intelligence, frankness, and cordiality.",
        "     [M. Maigne, physician to the infirmaries at Mantes.  Madame Campan\n     found in him a friend and comforter, of whose merit and affection\n     she knew the value.]",
        "Mantes is a cheerful place of residence, and the idea of an abode there\npleased her.  A few intimate friends formed a pleasant society, and she\nenjoyed a little tranquillity after so many disturbances.  The revisal of\nher “Memoirs,” the arrangement of the interesting anecdotes of which her\n\"Recollections” were to consist, alone diverted her mind from the one\npowerful sentiment which attached her to life.  She lived only for her\nson.  M. Campan deserved the tenderness of, his mother.  No sacrifice had\nbeen spared for his education.  After having pursued that course of study\nwhich, under the Imperial Government, produced men of such distinguished\nmerit, he was waiting till time and circumstances should afford him an\nopportunity of devoting his services to his country.  Although the state\nof his health was far from good, it did not threaten any rapid or\npremature decay; he was, however, after a few days’ illness, suddenly\ntaken from his family.  “I never witnessed so heartrending a scene,” M.\nMaigne says, “as that which took place when Marechal Ney’s lady, her\nniece, and Madame Pannelier, her sister, came to acquaint her with this\nmisfortune.–[The wife of Marechal Ney was a daughter of Madame Auguie,\nand had been an intimate friend of Hortense Beauharnais.]–When they\nentered her apartment she was in bed.  All three at once uttered a\npiercing cry.  The two ladies threw themselves on their knees, and kissed\nher hands, which they bedewed with tears.  Before they could speak to her\nshe read in their faces that she no longer possessed a son.  At that\ninstant her large eyes, opening wildly, seemed to wander.  Her face grew\npale, her features changed, her lips lost their colour, she struggled to\nspeak, but uttered only inarticulate sounds, accompanied by piercing\ncries.  Her gestures were wild, her reason was suspended.  Every part of\nher being was in agony.  To this state of anguish and despair no calm\nsucceeded, until her tears began to flow.  Friendship and the tenderest\ncares succeeded for a moment in calming her grief, but not in diminishing\nits power.",
        "“This violent crisis had disturbed her whole organisation.  A cruel\ndisorder, which required a still more cruel operation, soon manifested\nitself.  The presence of her family, a tour which she made in\nSwitzerland, a residence at Baden, and, above all, the sight, the tender\nand charming conversation of a person by whom she was affectionately\nbeloved, occasionally diverted her mind, and in a slight degree relieved\nher suffering.”  She underwent a serious operation, performed with\nextraordinary promptitude and the most complete success.  No unfavourable\nsymptoms appeared; Madame Campan was thought to be restored to her\nfriends; but the disorder was in the blood; it took another course: the\nchest became affected.  “From that moment,” says M. Maigne, “I could\nnever look on Madame Campan as living; she herself felt that she belonged\nno more to this world.”",
        "“My friend,” she said to her physician the day before her death, “I am\nattached to the simplicity of religion.  I hate all that savours of\nfanaticism.”  When her codicil was presented for her signature, her hand\ntrembled; “It would be a pity,” she said, “to stop when so fairly on the\nroad.”",
        "Madame Campan died on the 16th of March, 1822.  The cheerfulness she\ndisplayed throughout her malady had nothing affected in it.  Her\ncharacter was naturally powerful and elevated.  At the approach of death\nshe evinced the soul of a sage, without abandoning for an instant her\nfeminine character.",
        "I was fifteen years of age when I was appointed reader to Mesdames.\nI will begin by describing the Court at that period.",
        "Maria Leczinska was just dead; the death of the Dauphin had preceded hers\nby three years; the Jesuits were suppressed, and piety was to be found at\nCourt only in the apartments of Mesdames.  The Duc de Choiseuil ruled.",
        "Etiquette still existed at Court with all the forms it had acquired under\nLouis XIV.; dignity alone was wanting.  As to gaiety, there was none.\nVersailles was not the place at which to seek for assemblies where French\nspirit and grace were displayed.  The focus of wit and intelligence was\nParis.",
        "The King thought of nothing but the pleasures of the chase: it might have\nbeen imagined that the courtiers indulged themselves in making epigrams\nby hearing them say seriously, on those days when the King did not hunt,\n\"The King does nothing to-day.\"–[In sporting usance (see SOULAIRE, p.\n316).]",
        "The arrangement beforehand of his movements was also a matter of great\nimportance with Louis XV.  On the first day of the year he noted down in\nhis almanac the days of departure for Compiegne, Fontainebleau, Choisy,\netc.  The weightiest matters, the most serious events, never deranged\nthis distribution of his time.",
        "Since the death of the Marquise de Pompadour, the King had no titled\nmistress; he contented himself with his seraglio in the Parc-aux-Cerfs.\nIt is well known that the monarch found the separation of Louis de\nBourbon from the King of France the most animating feature of his royal\nexistence.  “They would have it so; they thought it for the best,” was\nhis way of expressing himself when the measures of his ministers were\nunsuccessful.  The King delighted to manage the most disgraceful points\nof his private expenses himself; he one day sold to a head clerk in the\nWar Department a house in which one of his mistresses had lodged; the\ncontract ran in the name of Louis de Bourbon, and the purchaser himself\ntook in a bag the price of the house in gold to the King in his private\ncloset.",
        "     [Until recently little was known about the Parc-aux-Cerfs, and it\n     was believed that a great number of young women had been maintained\n     there at enormous expense.  The investigations of M. J. A.  Le Roi,\n     given in his interesting work, “Curiosites Historiques sur Louis\n     XIII., Louis XIV., Louis XV.,” etc., Paris, Plon, 1864, have thrown\n     fresh light upon the matter.  The result he arrives at (see page 229\n     of his work) is that the house in question (No. 4 Rue St. Mederic,\n     on the site of the Pare-aux-Cerfs, or breeding-place for deer, of\n     Louis XIII) was very small, and could have held only one girl, the\n     woman in charge of her, and a servant.  Most of the girls left it\n     only when about to be confined, and it sometimes stood vacant for\n     five or six months.  It may have been rented before the date of\n     purchase, and other houses seem sometimes to have been used also;\n     but in any case, it is evident that both the number of girls and the\n     expense incurred have been absurdly exaggerated.  The system\n     flourished under Madame de Pompadour, but ceased as soon as Madame\n     du Barry obtained full power over the King, and the house was then\n     sold to M. J. B. Sevin for 16,000 livres, on 27th May, 1771, Louis\n     not acting under the name of Louis de Bourbon, but as King,–\"Vente\n     par le Roi, notre Sire.”  In 1755 he had also been declared its\n     purchaser in a similar manner.  Thus, Madame Campan is in error in\n     saying that the King made the contract as Louis de Bourbon.]–[And\n     it also possible that Madam Campan was correct and that the house\n     she refers to as sold for a “bag of gold” was another of the several\n     of the seraglio establishments of Louis XV.  D.W.]",
        "Louis XV. saw very little of his family.  He came every morning by a\nprivate staircase into the apartment of Madame Adelaide.",
        "     [Louis XV. seemed to feel for Madame Adelaide the tenderness he had\n     had for the Duchesse de Bourgogne, his mother, who perished so\n     suddenly, under the eyes and almost in the arms of Louis XIV.  The\n     birth of Madame Adelaide, 23d March, 1732, was followed by that of\n     Madame Victoire Louise Marie Therese on the 11th May, 1733.  Louis\n     had, besides, six daughters: Mesdames Sophie and Louise, who are\n     mentioned in this chapter; the Princesses Marie and Felicite, who\n     died young; Madame Henriette died at Versailles in 1752, aged\n     twenty-four; and finally, Madame the Duchess of Parma, who also died\n     at the Court.]",
        "He often brought and drank there coffee that he had made himself.  Madame\nAdelaide pulled a bell which apprised Madame Victoire of the King’s\nvisit; Madame Victoire, on rising to go to her sister’s apartment, rang\nfor Madame Sophie, who in her turn rang for Madame Louise.  The\napartments of Mesdames were of very large dimensions.  Madame Louise\noccupied the farthest room.  This latter lady was deformed and very\nshort; the poor Princess used to run with all her might to join the daily\nmeeting, but, having a number of rooms to cross, she frequently in spite\nof her haste, had only just time to embrace her father before he set out\nfor the chase.",
        "Every evening, at six, Mesdames interrupted my reading to them to\naccompany the princes to Louis XV.; this visit was called the King’s\n’debotter’,–[Debotter, meaning the time of unbooting.]– and was marked\nby a kind of etiquette.  Mesdames put on an enormous hoop, which set out\na petticoat ornamented with gold or embroidery; they fastened a long\ntrain round their waists, and concealed the undress of the rest of their\nclothing by a long cloak of black taffety which enveloped them up to the\nchin.  The chevaliers d’honneur, the ladies in waiting, the pages, the\nequerries, and the ushers bearing large flambeaux, accompanied them to\nthe King.  In a moment the whole palace, generally so still, was in\nmotion; the King kissed each Princess on the forehead, and the visit was\nso short that the reading which it interrupted was frequently resumed at\nthe end of a quarter of an hour; Mesdames returned to their apartments,\nand untied the strings of their petticoats and trains; they resumed their\ntapestry, and I my book.",
        "During the summer season the King sometimes came to the residence of\nMesdames before the hour of his ’debotter’.  One day he found me alone in\nMadame Victoire’s closet, and asked me where ’Coche’[Piggy] was; I\nstarted, and he repeated his question, but without being at all the more\nunderstood.  When the King was gone I asked Madame of whom he spoke.  She\ntold me that it was herself, and very coolly explained to me, that, being\nthe fattest of his daughters, the King had given her the familiar name of\n’Coche’; that he called Madame Adelaide, ’Logue’ [Tatters], Madame\nSophie, ’Graille’[Mite], and Madame Louise, ’Chiffie’[Rubbish].  The\npeople of the King’s household observed that he knew a great number of\nsuch words; possibly he had amused himself with picking them out from\ndictionaries.  If this style of speaking betrayed the habits and tastes\nof the King, his manner savoured nothing of such vulgarity; his walk was\neasy and noble, he had a dignified carriage of the head, and his aspect,\nwith out being severe, was imposing; he combined great politeness with a\ntruly regal demeanour, and gracefully saluted the humblest woman whom\ncuriosity led into his path.",
        "He was very expert in a number of trifling matters which never occupy\nattention but when there is a lack of something better to employ it; for\ninstance, he would knock off the top of an egg-shell at a single stroke\nof his fork; he therefore always ate eggs when he dined in public, and\nthe Parisians who came on Sundays to see the King dine, returned home\nless struck with his fine figure than with the dexterity with which he\nbroke his eggs.",
        "Repartees of Louis XV., which marked the keenness of his wit and the\nelevation of his sentiments, were quoted with pleasure in the assemblies\nof Versailles.",
        "This Prince was still beloved; it was wished that a style of life\nsuitable to his age and dignity should at length supersede the errors of\nthe past, and justify the love of his subjects.  It was painful to judge\nhim harshly.  If he had established avowed mistresses at Court, the\nuniform devotion of the Queen was blamed for it.  Mesdames were\nreproached for not seeking to prevent the King’s forming an intimacy with\nsome new favourite.  Madame Henriette, twin sister of the Duchess of\nParma, was much regretted, for she had considerable influence over the\nKing’s mind, and it was remarked that if she had lived she would have\nbeen assiduous in finding him amusements in the bosom of his family,\nwould have followed him in his short excursions, and would have done the\nhonours of the ’petits soupers’ which he was so fond of giving in his\nprivate apartments.",
        "Mesdames too much neglected the means of pleasing the wing, but the cause\nof that was obvious in the little attention he had paid them in their\nyouth.",
        "In order to console the people under their sufferings, and to shut their\neyes to the real depredations on the treasury, the ministers occasionally\npressed the most extravagant measures of reform in the King’s household,\nand even in his personal expenses.",
        "Cardinal Fleury, who in truth had the merit of reestablishing the\nfinances, carried this system of economy so far as to obtain from the\nKing the suppression of the household of the four younger Princesses.\nThey were brought up as mere boarders in a convent eighty leagues distant\nfrom the Court.  Saint Cyr would have been more suitable for the\nreception of the King’s daughters; but probably the Cardinal shared some\nof those prejudices which will always attach to even the most useful\ninstitutions, and which, since the death of Louis XIV., had been raised\nagainst the noble establishment of Madame de Maintenon.  Madame Louise\noften assured me that at twelve years of age she was not mistress of the\nwhole alphabet, and never learnt to read fluently until after her return\nto Versailles.",
        "Madame Victoire attributed certain paroxysms of terror, which she was\nnever able to conquer, to the violent alarms she experienced at the Abbey\nof Fontevrault, whenever she was sent, by way of penance, to pray alone\nin the vault where the sisters were interred.",
        "A gardener belonging to the abbey died raving mad.  His habitation,\nwithout the walls, was near a chapel of the abbey, where Mesdames were\ntaken to repeat the prayers for those in the agonies of death.  Their\nprayers were more than once interrupted by the shrieks of the dying man.",
        "When Mesdames, still very young, returned to Court, they enjoyed the\nfriendship of Monseigneur the Dauphin, and profited by his advice.  They\ndevoted themselves ardently to study, and gave up almost the whole of\ntheir time to it; they enabled themselves to write French correctly, and\nacquired a good knowledge of history.  Italian, English, the higher\nbranches of mathematics, turning and dialing, filled up in succession\ntheir leisure moments.  Madame Adelaide, in particular, had a most\ninsatiable desire to learn; she was taught to play upon all instruments,\nfrom the horn (will it be believed!) to the Jew’s-harp.",
        "Madame Adelaide was graced for a short time with a charming figure; but\nnever did beauty so quickly vanish.  Madame Victoire was handsome and\nvery graceful; her address, mien, and smile were in perfect accordance\nwith the goodness of her heart.  Madame Sophie was remarkably ugly; never\ndid I behold a person with so unprepossessing an appearance; she walked\nwith the greatest rapidity; and, in order to recognise the people who\nplaced themselves along her path without looking at them, she acquired\nthe habit of leering on one side, like a hare.  This Princess was so\nexceedingly diffident that a person might be with her daily for years\ntogether without hearing her utter a single word.  It was asserted,\nhowever, that she displayed talent, and even amiability, in the society\nof some favourite ladies.  She taught herself a great deal, but she\nstudied alone; the presence of a reader would have disconcerted her very\nmuch.  There were, however, occasions on which the Princess, generally so\nintractable, became all at once affable and condescending, and manifested\nthe most communicative good-nature; this would happen during a storm; so\ngreat was her alarm on such an occasion that she then approached the most\nhumble, and would ask them a thousand obliging questions; a flash of\nlightning made her squeeze their hands; a peal of thunder would drive her\nto embrace them, but with the return of the calm, the Princess resumed\nher stiffness, her reserve, and her repellent air, and passed all by\nwithout taking the slightest notice of any one, until a fresh storm\nrestored to her at once her dread and her affability. [Which reminds one\nof the elder (and puritanic) Cato who said that he “embraced” his wife\nonly when it thundered, but added that he did enjoy a good thunderstorm.\nD.W.]",
        "Mesdames found in a beloved brother, whose rare attainments are known to\nall Frenchmen, a guide in everything wanting to their education.  In\ntheir august mother, Maria Leczinska, they possessed the noblest example\nof every pious and social virtue; that Princess, by her eminent qualities\nand her modest dignity, veiled the failings of the King, and while she\nlived she preserved in the Court of Louis XV. that decorous and dignified\ntone which alone secures the respect due to power.  The Princesses, her\ndaughters, were worthy of her; and if a few degraded beings did aim the\nshafts of calumny at them, these shafts dropped harmless, warded off by\nthe elevation of their sentiments and the purity of their conduct.",
        "If Mesdames had not tasked themselves with numerous occupations, they\nwould have been much to be pitied.  They loved walking, but could enjoy\nnothing beyond the public gardens of Versailles; they would have\ncultivated flowers, but could have no others than those in their windows.",
        "The Marquise de Durfort, since Duchesse de Civrac, afforded to Madame\nVictoire agreeable society.  The Princess spent almost all her evenings\nwith that lady, and ended by fancying herself domiciled with her.",
        "Madame de Narbonne had, in a similar way, taken pains to make her\nintimate acquaintance pleasant to Madame Adelaide.",
        "Madame Louise had for many years lived in great seclusion; I read to her\nfive hours a day.  My voice frequently betrayed the exhaustion of my\nlungs; the Princess would then prepare sugared water for me, place it by\nme, and apologise for making me read so long, on the score of having\nprescribed a course of reading for herself.",
        "One evening, while I was reading, she was informed that M. Bertin,\n’ministre des parties casuelles’, desired to speak with her; she went out\nabruptly, returned, resumed her silks and embroidery, and made me resume\nmy book; when I retired she commanded me to be in her closet the next\nmorning at eleven o’clock.  When I got there the Princess was gone out;\nI learnt that she had gone at seven in the morning to the Convent of the\nCarmelites of St. Denis, where she was desirous of taking the veil.\nI went to Madame Victoire; there I heard that the King alone had been\nacquainted with Madame Louise’s project; that he had kept it faithfully\nsecret, and that, having long previously opposed her wish, he had only on\nthe preceding evening sent her his consent; that she had gone alone into\nthe convent, where she was expected; and that a few minutes afterwards\nshe had made her appearance at the grating, to show to the Princesse de\nGuistel, who had accompanied her to the convent gate, and to her equerry,\nthe King’s order to leave her in the monastery.",
        "Upon receiving the intelligence of her sister’s departure, Madame\nAdelaide gave way to violent paroxysms of rage, and reproached the King\nbitterly for the secret, which he had thought it his duty to preserve.\nMadame Victoire missed the society of her favourite sister, but she shed\ntears in silence only.  The first time I saw this excellent Princess\nafter Madame Louise’s departure, I threw myself at her feet, kissed her\nhand, and asked her, with all the confidence of youth, whether she would\nquit us as Madame Louise had done.  She raised me, embraced me; and said,\npointing to the lounge upon which she was extended, “Make yourself easy,\nmy dear; I shall never have Louise’s courage.  I love the conveniences of\nlife too well; this lounge is my destruction.”  As soon as I obtained\npermission to do so, I went to St. Denis to see my late mistress; she\ndeigned to receive me with her face uncovered, in her private parlour;\nshe told me she had just left the wash-house, and that it was her turn\nthat day to attend to the linen.  “I much abused your youthful lungs for\ntwo years before the execution of my project,” added she. “I knew that\nhere I could read none but books tending to our salvation, and I wished\nto review all the historians that had interested me.”",
        "She informed me that the King’s consent for her to go to St. Denis had\nbeen brought to her while I was reading; she prided herself, and with\nreason, upon having returned to her closet without the slightest mark of\nagitation, though she said she felt so keenly that she could scarcely\nregain her chair.  She added that moralists were right when they said\nthat happiness does not dwell in palaces; that she had proved it; and\nthat, if I desired to be happy, she advised me to come and enjoy a\nretreat in which the liveliest imagination might find full exercise in\nthe contemplation of a better world.  I had no palace, no earthly\ngrandeur to sacrifice to God; nothing but the bosom of a united family;\nand it is precisely there that the moralists whom she cited have placed\ntrue happiness.  I replied that, in private life, the absence of a\nbeloved and cherished daughter would be too cruelly felt by her family.\nThe Princess said no more on the subject.",
        "The seclusion of Madame Louise was attributed to various motives; some\nwere unkind enough to suppose it to have been occasioned by her\nmortification at being, in point of rank, the last of the Princesses.\nI think I penetrated the true cause.  Her aspirations were lofty; she\nloved everything sublime; often while I was reading she would interrupt\nme to exclaim, “That is beautiful! that is noble!”  There was but one\nbrilliant action that she could perform,–to quit a palace for a cell,\nand rich garments for a stuff gown.  She achieved it!",
        "I saw Madame Louise two or three times more at the grating.  I was\ninformed of her death by Louis XVI.  “My Aunt Louise,” said he to me,\n\"your old mistress, is just dead at St.  Denis.  I have this moment\nreceived intelligence of it.  Her piety and resignation were admirable,\nand yet the delirium of my good aunt recalled to her recollection that\nshe was a princess, for her last words were, ’To paradise, haste, haste,\nfull speed.’  No doubt she thought she was again giving orders to her\nequerry.”",
        "     [The retirement of Madame Louise, and her removal from Court, had\n     only served to give her up entirely to the intrigues of the clergy.\n     She received incessant visits from bishops, archbishops, and\n     ambitious priests of every rank; she prevailed on the King, her\n     father, to grant many ecclesiastical preferments, and probably\n     looked forward to playing an important part when the King, weary of\n     his licentious course of life, should begin to think of religion.\n     This, perhaps, might have been the case had not a sudden and\n     unexpected death put an end to his career.  The project of Madame\n     Louise fell to the ground in consequence of this event.  She\n     remained in her convent, whence she continued to solicit favours,\n     as I knew from the complaints of the Queen, who often said to me,\n     “Here is another letter from my Aunt Louise.  She is certainly the\n     most intriguing little Carmelite in the kingdom.”  The Court went to\n     visit her about three times a year, and I recollect that the Queen,\n     intending to take her daughter there, ordered me to get a doll\n     dressed like a Carmelite for her, that the young Princess might be\n     accustomed, before she went into the convent, to the habit of her\n     aunt, the nun.–MADAME CAMPAN]",
        "Madame Victoire, good, sweet-tempered, and affable, lived with the most\namiable simplicity in a society wherein she was much caressed; she was\nadored by her household.  Without quitting Versailles, without\nsacrificing her easy chair, she fulfilled the duties of religion with\npunctuality, gave to the poor all she possessed, and strictly observed\nLent and the fasts.  The table of Mesdames acquired a reputation for\ndishes of abstinence, spread abroad by the assiduous parasites at that of\ntheir maitre d’hotel.  Madame Victoire was not indifferent to good\nliving, but she had the most religious scruples respecting dishes of\nwhich it was allowable to partake at penitential times.  I saw her one\nday exceedingly tormented by her doubts about a water-fowl, which was\noften served up to her during Lent.  The question to be determined was,\nwhether it was ’maigre’ or ’gras’.  She consulted a bishop, who happened\nto be of the party: the prelate immediately assumed the grave attitude of\na judge who is about to pronounce sentence.  He answered the Princess\nthat, in a similar case of doubt, it had been resolved that after\ndressing the bird it should be pricked over a very cold silver dish; if\nthe gravy of the animal congealed within a quarter of an hour, the\ncreature was to be accounted flesh; but if the gravy remained in an oily\nstate, it might be eaten without scruple.  Madame Victoire immediately\nmade the experiment: the gravy did not congeal; and this was a source of\ngreat joy to the Princess, who was very partial to that sort of game.\nThe abstinence which so much occupied the attention of Madame Victoire\nwas so disagreeable to her, that she listened with impatience for the\nmidnight hour of Holy Saturday; and then she was immediately supplied\nwith a good dish of fowl and rice, and sundry other succulent viands.\nShe confessed with such amiable candour her taste for good cheer and the\ncomforts of life, that it would have been necessary to be as severe in\nprinciple as insensible to the excellent qualities of the Princess, to\nconsider it a crime in her.",
        "Madame Adelaide had more mind than Madame Victoire; but she was\naltogether deficient in that kindness which alone creates affection for\nthe great, abrupt manners, a harsh voice, and a short way of speaking,\nrendering her more than imposing.  She carried the idea of the\nprerogative of rank to a high pitch.  One of her chaplains was unlucky\nenough to say ’Dominus vobiscum’ with rather too easy an air; the\nPrincess rated him soundly for it after mass, and told him to remember\nthat he was not a bishop, and not again to think of officiating in the\nstyle of a prelate.",
        "Mesdames lived quite separate from the King.  Since the death of Madame\nde Pompadour he had lived alone.  The enemies of the Duc de Choiseul did\nnot know in what department, nor through what channel, they could prepare\nand bring about the downfall of the man who stood in their way.  The King\nwas connected only with women of so low a class that they could not be\nmade use of for any delicate intrigue; moreover, the Parc-aux-Cerfs was a\nseraglio, the beauties of which were often replaced; it was desirable to\ngive the King a mistress who could form a circle, and in whose drawing-\nroom the long-standing attachment of the King for the Duc de Choiseul\nmight be overcome.  It is true that Madame du Barry was selected from a\nclass sufficiently low.  Her origin, her education, her habits, and\neverything about her bore a character of vulgarity and shamelessness; but\nby marrying her to a man whose pedigree dated from 1400, it was thought\nscandal would be avoided.  The conqueror of Mahon conducted this coarse\nintrigue.",
        "     [It appeared at this period as if every feeling of dignity was lost.\n     “Few noblemen of the French Court,” says a writer of the time,\n     “preserved themselves from the general corruption.  The Marechal de\n     Brissac was one of the latter.  He was bantered on the strictness of\n     his principles of honour and honesty; it was thought strange that he\n     should be offended by being thought, like so many others, exposed to\n     hymeneal disgrace.  Louis XV., who was present, and laughed at his\n     angry fit, said to him: ’Come, M. de Brissac, don’t be angry; ’tis\n     but a trifling evil; take courage.’–’Sire,’ replied M. de Brissac,\n     ’I possess all kinds of courage, except that which can brave\n     shame.’\"–NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]",
        "Such a mistress was judiciously selected for the diversion of the latter\nyears of a man weary of grandeur, fatigued with pleasure, and cloyed with\nvoluptuousness.  Neither the wit, the talents, the graces of the Marquise\nde Pompadour, her beauty, nor even her love for the King, would have had\nany further influence over that worn-out being.",
        "He wanted a Roxalana of familiar gaiety, without any respect for the\ndignity of the sovereign.  Madame du Barry one day so far forgot\npropriety as to desire to be present at a Council of State.  The King was\nweak enough to consent to it.  There she remained ridiculously perched\nupon the arm of his chair, playing all sorts of childish monkey tricks,\ncalculated to please an old sultan.",
        "Another time she snatched a packet of sealed letters from the King’s\nhand.  Among them she had observed one from Comte de Broglie.  She told\nthe King that she knew that rascal Broglie spoke ill of her to him, and\nthat for once, at least, she would make sure he should read nothing\nrespecting her.  The King wanted to get the packet again; she resisted,\nand made him run two or three times round the table, which was in the\nmiddle of the council-chamber, and then, on passing the fireplace, she\nthrew the letters into the grate, where they were consumed.  The King\nbecame furious; he seized his audacious mistress by the arm, and put her\nout of the door without speaking to her.  Madame du Barry thought herself\nutterly disgraced; she returned home, and remained two hours, alone,\nabandoned to the utmost distress.  The King went to her; she threw\nherself at his feet, in tears, and he pardoned her.",
        "Madame la Marechale de Beauvau, the Duchesse de Choiseul, and the\nDuchesse de Grammont had renounced the honour of the King’s intimate\nacquaintance rather than share it with Madame du Barry.  But a few years\nafter the death of Louis XV., Madame la Marechale being alone at the Val,\na house belonging to M. de Beauvau, Mademoiselle de Dillon saw the\nCountess’s calash take shelter in the forest of St. Germain during a\nviolent storm.  She invited her in, and the Countess herself related\nthese particulars, which I had from Madame de Beauvau.",
        "The Comte du Barry, surnamed ’le roue’ (the profligate), and Mademoiselle\ndu Barry advised, or rather prompted, Madame du Barry in furtherance of\nthe plans of the party of the Marechal de Richelieu and the Duc\nd’Aiguillon.  Sometimes they even set her to act in such a way as to have\na useful influence upon great political measures.  Under pretence that\nthe page who accompanied Charles I. in his flight was a Du Barry or\nBarrymore, they persuaded the Comtesse du Barry to buy in London that\nfine portrait which we now have in the Museum.  She had the picture\nplaced in her drawing-room, and when she saw the King hesitating upon the\nviolent measure of breaking up his Parliament, and forming that which was\ncalled the Maupeou Parliament, she desired him to look at the portrait of\na king who had given way to his Parliament.",
        "     [The “Memoirs of General Dumouriez,” vol. i., page 142, contain\n     some curious particulars about Madame Du Barry; and novel details\n     respecting her will be found at page 243 of “Curiosites\n     Historiques,” by J. A. Le Rol (Paris, Plon, 1864).  His\n     investigations lead to the result that her real name was Jean Becu,\n     born, 19th August, 1743, at Vaucouleurs, the natural daughter of\n     Anne Becu, otherwise known as “Quantiny.”  Her mother afterwards\n     married Nicolas Rancon.  Comte Jean du Barry met her among the demi-\n     monde, and succeeded, about 1767, and by the help of his friend\n     Label, the valet de chambre of Louis XV., in introducing her to the\n     King under the name of Mademoiselle l’Ange.  To be formally\n     mistress, a husband had to be found.  The Comte Jean du Barry,\n     already married himself, found no difficulty in getting his brother,\n     Comte Guillaume, a poor officer of the marine troops, to accept the\n     post of husband.  In the marriage-contract, signed on 23d July,\n     1768, she was described as the daughter of Anne Becu and of an\n     imaginary first husband, Sieur Jean Jacques Gomard de Vaubernier,\"\n     and three years were taken off her age.  The marriage-contract was\n     so drawn as to leave Madame du Barry entirely free from all control\n     by her husband.  The marriage was solemnised on 1st September, 1768,\n     after which the nominal husband returned to Toulouse.  Madame du\n     Barry in later years provided for him; and in 1772, tired of his\n     applications, she obtained an act of separation from him.  He\n     married later Jeanne Madeleine Lemoine, and died in 1811.  Madame du\n     Barry took care of her mother, who figured as Madame de Montrable.\n     In all, she received from the King, M. Le Roi calculates, about\n     twelve and a half millions of livres.  On the death of Louis XV.\n     she had to retire first to the Abbey of Pont-aux-Dames, near Meaux,\n     then she was allowed to go to her small house at St. Vrain, near\n     Arpajon, and, finally, in 1775, to her chateau at Louveciennes.\n     Much to her credit be it said, she retained many of her friends,\n     and was on the most intimate terms till his death with the Duc de\n     Brissac (Louis Hercule Timoldon de Cosse-Brissac), who was killed at\n     Versailles in the massacre of the prisoners in September, 1792,\n     leaving at his death a large legacy to her.  Even the Emperor Joseph\n     visited her.  In 1791 many of her jewels were stolen and taken to\n     England.  This caused her to make several visits to that country,\n     where she gained her suit.  But these visits, though she took every\n     precaution to legalise them, ruined her.  Betrayed by her servants,\n     among them by Zamor, the negro page, she was brought before the\n     Revolutionary tribunal, and was guillotined on 8th December, 1793,\n     in a frenzy of terror, calling for mercy and for delay up to the\n     moment when her head fell.]",
        "The men of ambition who were labouring to overthrow the Duc de Choiseul\nstrengthened themselves by their concentration at the house of the\nfavourite, and succeeded in their project.  The bigots, who never forgave\nthat minister the suppression of the Jesuits, and who had always been\nhostile to a treaty of alliance with Austria, influenced the minds of\nMesdames.  The Duc de La Vauguyon, the young Dauphin’s governor, infected\nthem with the same prejudices.",
        "Such was the state of the public mind when the young Archduchess Marie\nAntoinette arrived at the Court of Versailles, just at the moment when\nthe party which brought her there was about to be overthrown.",
        "Madame Adelaide openly avowed her dislike to a princess of the House of\nAustria; and when M. Campan, my father-in-law, went to receive his\norders, at the moment of setting off with the household of the\nDauphiness, to go and receive the Archduchess upon the frontiers, she\nsaid she disapproved of the marriage of her nephew with an archduchess;\nand that, if she had the direction of the matter, she would not send for\nan Austrian.",
        "MARIE ANTOINETTE JOSEPHE JEANNE DE LORRAINE, Archduchess of Austria,\ndaughter of Francois de Lorraine and of Maria Theresa, was born on the\n2d of November, 1755, the day of the earthquake at Lisbon; and this\ncatastrophe, which appeared to stamp the era of her birth with a fatal\nmark, without forming a motive for superstitious fear with the Princess,\nnevertheless made an impression upon her mind.  As the Empress already\nhad a great number of daughters, she ardently desired to have another\nson, and playfully wagered against her wish with the Duc de Tarouka,\nwho had insisted that she would give birth to an archduke.  He lost by\nthe birth of the Princess, and had executed in porcelain a figure with\none knee bent on the earth, and presenting tablets, upon which the\nfollowing lines by Metastasio were engraved:",
        "               I lose by your fair daughter’s birth\n               Who prophesied a son;\n               But if she share her mother’s worth,\n               Why, all the world has won!",
        "The Queen was fond of talking of the first years of her youth.  Her\nfather, the Emperor Francis, had made a deep impression upon her heart;\nshe lost him when she was scarcely seven years old.  One of those\ncircumstances which fix themselves strongly in the memories of children\nfrequently recalled his last caresses to her.  The Emperor was setting\nout for Innspruck; he had already left his palace, when he ordered a\ngentleman to fetch the Archduchess Marie Antoinette, and bring her to his\ncarriage.  When she came, he stretched out his arms to receive her, and\nsaid, after having pressed her to his bosom, “I wanted to embrace this\nchild once more.”  The Emperor died suddenly during the journey, and\nnever saw his beloved daughter again.",
        "The Queen often spoke of her mother, and with profound respect, but she\nbased all her schemes for the education of her children on the essentials\nwhich had been neglected in her own.  Maria Theresa, who inspired awe by\nher great qualities, taught the Archduchesses to fear and respect rather\nthan to love her; at least I observed this in the Queen’s feelings\ntowards her august mother.  She therefore never desired to place between\nher own children and herself that distance which had existed in the\nimperial family.  She cited a fatal consequence of it, which had made\nsuch a powerful impression upon her that time had never been able to\nefface it.",
        "The wife of the Emperor Joseph II. was taken from him in a few days by\nan attack of smallpox of the most virulent kind.  Her coffin had recently\nbeen deposited in the vault of the imperial family.  The Archduchess\nJosepha, who had been betrothed to the King of Naples, at the instant she\nwas quitting Vienna received an order from the Empress not to set off\nwithout having offered up a prayer in the vault of her forefathers.  The\nArchduchess, persuaded that she should take the disorder to which her\nsister-in-law had just fallen a victim, looked upon this order as her\ndeath-warrant.  She loved the young Archduchess Marie Antoinette\ntenderly; she took her upon her knees, embraced her with tears, and told\nher she was about to leave her, not for Naples, but never to see her\nagain; that she was going down then to the tomb of her ancestors, and\nthat she should shortly go again there to remain.  Her anticipation was\nrealised; confluent smallpox carried her off in a very few days, and her\nyoungest sister ascended the throne of Naples in her place.",
        "The Empress was too much taken up with high political interests to have\nit in her power to devote herself to maternal attentions.  The celebrated\nWansvietten, her physician, went daily, to visit the young imperial\nfamily, and afterwards to Maria Theresa, and gave the most minute details\nrespecting the health of the Archdukes and Archduchesses, whom she\nherself sometimes did not see for eight or ten days at a time.  As soon\nas the arrival of a stranger of rank at Vienna was made known, the\nEmpress brought her family about her, admitted them to her table, and by\nthis concerted meeting induced a belief that she herself presided over\nthe education of her children.",
        "The chief governesses, being under no fear of inspection from Maria\nTheresa, aimed at making themselves beloved by their pupils by the common\nand blamable practice of indulgence, so fatal to the future progress and\nhappiness of children.  Marie Antoinette was the cause of her governess\nbeing dismissed, through a confession that all her copies and all her\nletters were invariably first traced out with pencil; the Comtesse de\nBrandes was appointed to succeed her, and fulfilled her duties with great\nexactness and talent.  The Queen looked upon having been confided to her\ncare so late as a misfortune, and always continued upon terms of\nfriendship with that lady.  The education of Marie Antoinette was\ncertainly very much neglected.  With the exception of the Italian\nlanguage, all that related to belles lettres, and particularly to\nhistory, even that of her own country, was almost entirely unknown to\nher.  This was soon found out at the Court of France, and thence arose\nthe generally received opinion that she was deficient in sense.  It will\nbe seen in the course of these “Memoirs” whether that opinion was well or\nill founded.  The public prints, however, teemed with assertions of the\nsuperior talents of Maria Theresa’s children.  They often noticed the\nanswers which the young Princesses gave in Latin to the harangues\naddressed to them; they uttered them, it is true, but without\nunderstanding them; they knew not a single word of that language.",
        "Mention was one day made to the Queen of a drawing made by her, and\npresented by the Empress to M. Gerard, chief clerk of Foreign Affairs, on\nthe occasion of his going to Vienna to draw up the articles for her\nmarriage-contract.  “I should blush,” said she, “if that proof of the\nquackery of my education were shown to me.  I do not believe that I ever\nput a pencil to that drawing.”  However, what had been taught her she\nknew perfectly well.  Her facility of learning was inconceivable, and if\nall her teachers had been as well informed and as faithful to their duty\nas the Abbe Metastasio, who taught her Italian, she would have attained\nas great a superiority in the other branches of her education.  The Queen\nspoke that language with grace and ease, and translated the most\ndifficult poets.  She did not write French correctly, but she spoke it\nwith the greatest fluency, and even affected to say that she had lost\nGerman.  In fact she attempted in 1787 to learn her mother-tongue, and\ntook lessons assiduously for six weeks; she was obliged to relinquish\nthem, finding all the difficulties which a Frenchwoman, who should take\nup the study too late, would have to encounter.  In the same manner she\ngave up English, which I had taught her for some time, and in which she\nhad made rapid progress.  Music was the accomplishment in which the Queen\nmost delighted.  She did not play well on any instrument, but she had\nbecome able to read at sight like a first-rate professor.  She attained\nthis degree of perfection in France, this branch of her education having\nbeen neglected at Vienna as much as the rest.  A few days after her\narrival at Versailles, she was introduced to her singing-master, La\nGarde, author of the opera of “Egle.”  She made a distant appointment\nwith him, needing, as she said, rest after the fatigues of the journey\nand the numerous fetes which had taken place at Versailles; but her\nmotive was her desire to conceal how ignorant she was of the rudiments of\nmusic.  She asked M. Campan whether his son, who was a good musician,\ncould give her lessons secretly for three months.  “The Dauphiness,\"\nadded she, smiling, “must be careful of the reputation of the\nArchduchess.”  The lessons were given privately, and at the end of three\nmonths of constant application she sent for M. la Garde, and surprised\nhim by her skill.",
        "The desire to perfect Marie Antoinette in the study of the French\nlanguage was probably the motive which determined Maria Theresa to\nprovide for her as teachers two French actors: Aufresne, for\npronunciation and declamation, and Sainville, for taste in French\nsinging; the latter had been an officer in France, and bore a bad\ncharacter.  The choice gave just umbrage to our Court.  The Marquis de\nDurfort, at that time ambassador at Vienna, was ordered to make a\nrepresentation to the Empress upon her selection.  The two actors were\ndismissed, and the Princess required that an ecclesiastic should be sent\nto her.  Several eminent ecclesiastics declined taking upon themselves so\ndelicate an office; others who were pointed out by Maria Theresa (among\nthe rest the Abbe Grisel) belonged to parties which sufficed to exclude\nthem.",
        "The Archbishop of Toulouse one day went to the Duc de Choiseul at the\nmoment when he was much embarrassed upon the subject of this nomination;\nhe proposed to him the Abby de Vermond, librarian of the College des\nQuatre Nations.  The eulogistic manner in which he spoke of his protege\nprocured the appointment for the latter on that very day; and the\ngratitude of the Abbe de Vermond towards the prelate was very fatal to\nFrance, inasmuch as after seventeen years of persevering attempts to\nbring him into the ministry, he succeeded at last in getting him named\nComptroller-General and President of the Council.–[Comte de Brienne,\nlater Archbishop of Sens.]",
        "This Abbe de Vermond directed almost all the Queen’s actions.  He\nestablished his influence over her at an age when impressions are most\ndurable; and it was easy to see that he had taken pains only to render\nhimself beloved by his pupil, and had troubled himself very little with\nthe care of instructing her.  He might have even been accused of having,\nby a sharp-sighted though culpable policy, purposely left her in\nignorance.  Marie Antoinette spoke the French language with much grace,\nbut wrote it less perfectly.  The Abbe de Vermond revised all the letters\nwhich she sent to Vienna.  The insupportable folly with which he boasted\nof it displayed the character of a man more flattered at being admitted\ninto her intimate secrets than anxious to fulfil worthily the high office\nof her preceptor.",
        "     [The Abbe de Vermond encouraged the impatience of etiquette shown by\n     Marie Antoinette while she was Dauphiness.  When she became Queen he\n     endeavoured openly to induce her to shake off the restraints she\n     still respected.  If he chanced to enter her apartment at the time\n     she was preparing to go out, “For whom,” he would say, in a tone of\n     raillery, “is this detachment of warriors which I found in the\n     court? Is it some general going to inspect his army?  Does all this\n     military display become a young Queen adored by her subjects?”  He\n     would call to her mind the simplicity with which Maria Theresa\n     lived; the visits she made without guards, or even attendants, to\n     the Prince d’Esterhazy, to the Comte de Palfi, passing whole days\n     far from the fatiguing ceremonies of the Court.  The Abbe thus\n     artfully flattered the inclinations of Marie Antoinette, and showed\n     her how she might disguise, even from herself, her aversion for the\n     ceremonies observed by the descendants of Louis XIV.-MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "His pride received its birth at Vienna, where Maria Theresa, as much to\ngive him authority with the Archduchess as to make herself acquainted\nwith his character, permitted him to mix every evening with the private\ncircle of her family, into which the future Dauphiness had been admitted\nfor some time.  Joseph II., the elder Archduchess, and a few noblemen\nhonoured by the confidence of Maria Theresa, composed the party; and\nreflections on the world, on courts, and the duties of princes were the\nusual topics of conversation.  The Abbe de Vermond, in relating these\nparticulars, confessed the means which he had made use of to gain\nadmission into this private circle.  The Empress, meeting him at the\nArchduchess’s, asked him if he had formed any connections in Vienna.\n\"None, Madame,” replied he; “the apartment of the Archduchess and the\nhotel of the ambassador of France are the only places which the man\nhonoured with the care of the Princess’s education should frequent.\"\nA month afterwards Maria Theresa, through a habit common enough among\nsovereigns, asked him the same question, and received precisely the same\nanswer.  The next day he received an order to join the imperial family\nevery evening.",
        "It is extremely probable, from the constant and well-known intercourse\nbetween this man and Comte de Mercy, ambassador of the Empire during the\nwhole reign of Louis XVI., that he was useful to the Court of Vienna, and\nthat he often caused the Queen to decide on measures, the consequences of\nwhich she did not consider.  Not of high birth, imbued with all the\nprinciples of the modern philosophy, and yet holding to the hierarchy of\nthe Church more tenaciously than any other ecclesiastic; vain, talkative,\nand at the same time cunning and abrupt; very ugly and affecting\nsingularity; treating the most exalted persons as his equals, sometimes\neven as his inferiors, the Abbe de Vermond received ministers and bishops\nwhen in his bath; but said at the same time that Cardinal Dubois was a\nfool; that a man such as he, having obtained power, ought to make\ncardinals, and refuse to be one himself.",
        "Intoxicated with the reception he had met with at the Court of Vienna,\nand having till then seen nothing of high life, the Abbe de Vermond\nadmired no other customs than those of the imperial family; he ridiculed\nthe etiquette of the House of Bourbon incessantly; the young Dauphiness\nwas constantly incited by his sarcasms to get rid of it, and it was he\nwho first induced her to suppress an infinity of practices of which he\ncould discern neither the prudence nor the political aim.  Such is the\nfaithful portrait of that man whom the evil star of Marie Antoinette had\nreserved to guide her first steps upon a stage so conspicuous and so full\nof danger as that of the Court of Versailles.",
        "It will be thought, perhaps, that I draw the character of the Abbe de\nVermond too unfavourably; but how can I view with any complacency one\nwho, after having arrogated to himself the office of confidant and sole\ncounsellor of the Queen, guided her with so little prudence, and gave us\nthe mortification of seeing that Princess blend, with qualities which\ncharmed all that surrounded her, errors alike injurious to her glory and\nher happiness?",
        "While M. de Choiseul, satisfied with the person whom M. de Brienne had\npresented, despatched him to Vienna with every eulogium calculated to\ninspire unbounded confidence, the Marquis de Durfort sent off a\nhairdresser and a few French fashions; and then it was thought sufficient\npains had been taken to form the character of a princess destined to\nshare the throne of France.",
        "The marriage of Monseigneur the Dauphin with the Archduchess was\ndetermined upon during the administration of the Duc de Choiseul.\nThe Marquis de Durfort, who was to succeed the Baron de Breteuil in the\nembassy to Vienna, was appointed proxy for the marriage ceremony; but six\nmonths after the Dauphin’s marriage the Duc de Choiseul was disgraced,\nand Madame de Marsan and Madame de Guemenee, who grew more powerful\nthrough the Duke’s disgrace, conferred that embassy, upon Prince Louis\nde Rohan, afterwards cardinal and grand almoner.",
        "Hence it will be seen that the Gazette de France is a sufficient answer\nto those libellers who dared to assert that the young Archduchess was\nacquainted with the Cardinal de Rohan before the period of her marriage.\nA worse selection in itself, or one more disagreeable to Maria Theresa,\nthan that which sent to her, in quality, of ambassador, a man so\nfrivolous and so immoral as Prince Louis de Rohan, could not have been\nmade.  He possessed but superficial knowledge upon any subject, and was\ntotally ignorant of diplomatic affairs.  His reputation had gone before\nhim to Vienna, and his mission opened under the most unfavourable\nauspices.  In want of money, and the House of Rohan being unable to make\nhim any considerable advances, he obtained from his Court a patent which\nauthorised him to borrow the sum of 600,000 livres upon his benefices,\nran in debt above a million, and thought to dazzle the city and Court of\nVienna by the most indecent and ill-judged extravagance.  He formed a\nsuite of eight or ten gentlemen, of names sufficiently high-sounding;\ntwelve pages equally well born, a crowd of officers and servants, a\ncompany of chamber musicians, etc.  But this idle pomp did not last;\nembarrassment and distress soon showed themselves; his people, no longer\nreceiving pay, in order to make money, abused the privileges of\nambassadors, and smuggled",
        "     [I have often heard the Queen say that, at Vienna, in the office of\n     the secretary of the Prince de Rohan, there were sold in one year\n     more silk stockings than at Lyons and Paris together.–MADAME\n     CAMPAN.]",
        "with so much effrontery that Maria Theresa, to put a stop to it without\noffending the Court of France, was compelled to suppress the privileges\nin this respect of all the diplomatic bodies, a step which rendered the\nperson and conduct of Prince Louis odious in every foreign Court.  He\nseldom obtained private audiences from the Empress, who did not esteem\nhim, and who expressed herself without reserve upon his conduct both as a\nbishop and as an ambassador.  He thought to obtain favour by assisting to\neffect the marriage of the Archduchess Elizabeth, the elder sister of\nMarie Antoinette, with Louis XV., an affair which was awkwardly\nundertaken, and of which Madame du Barry had no difficulty in causing the\nfailure.  I have deemed it my duty to omit no particular of the moral and\npolitical character of a man whose existence was subsequently so\ninjurious to the reputation of Marie Antoinette.",
        "A superb pavilion had been prepared upon the frontier near Kehl.  It\nconsisted of a vast salon, connected with two apartments, one of which\nwas assigned to the lords and ladies of the Court of Vienna, and the\nother to the suite of the Dauphiness, composed of the Comtesse de\nNoailles, her lady of honour; the Duchesse de Cosse, her dame d’atours;\nfour ladies of the palace; the Comte de Saulx-Tavannes, chevalier\nd’honneur; the Comte de Tesse, first equerry; the Bishop of Chartres,\nfirst almoner; the officers of the Body Guard, and the equerries.",
        "When the Dauphiness had been entirely undressed, in order that she might\nretain nothing belonging to a foreign Court (an etiquette always observed\non such an occasion), the doors were opened; the young Princess came\nforward, looking round for the Comtesse de Noailles; then, rushing into\nher arms, she implored her, with tears in her eyes, and with heartfelt\nsincerity, to be her guide and support.",
        "While doing justice to the virtues of the Comtesse de Noailles, those\nsincerely attached to the Queen have always considered it as one of her\nearliest misfortunes not to have found, in the person of her adviser,\na woman indulgent, enlightened, and administering good advice with that\namiability which disposes young persons to follow it.  The Comtesse de\nNoailles had nothing agreeable in her appearance; her demeanour was stiff\nand her mien severe.  She was perfect mistress of etiquette; but she\nwearied the young Princess with it, without making her sensible of its\nimportance.  It would have been sufficient to represent to the Dauphiness\nthat in France her dignity depended much upon customs not necessary at\nVienna to secure the respect and love of the good and submissive\nAustrians for the imperial family; but the Dauphiness was perpetually\ntormented by the remonstrances of the Comtesse de Noailles, and at the\nsame time was led by the Abbe de Vermond to ridicule both the lessons\nupon etiquette and her who gave them.  She preferred raillery to\nargument, and nicknamed the Comtesse de Noailles Madame l’Etiquette.",
        "The fetes which were given at Versailles on the marriage of the Dauphin\nwere very splendid.  The Dauphiness arrived there at the hour for her\ntoilet, having slept at La Muette, where Louis XV. had been to receive\nher; and where that Prince, blinded by a feeling unworthy of a sovereign\nand the father of a family, caused the young Princess, the royal family,\nand the ladies of the Court, to sit down to supper with Madame du Barry.",
        "The Dauphiness was hurt at this conduct; she spoke of it openly enough to\nthose with whom she was intimate, but she knew how to conceal her\ndissatisfaction in public, and her behaviour showed no signs of it.",
        "She was received at Versailles in an apartment on the ground floor, under\nthat of the late Queen, which was not ready for her until six months\nafter her marriage.",
        "The Dauphiness, then fifteen years of age, beaming with freshness,\nappeared to all eyes more than beautiful.  Her walk partook at once of\nthe dignity of the Princesses of her house, and of the grace of the\nFrench; her eyes were mild, her smile amiable.  When she went to chapel,\nas soon as she had taken the first few steps in the long gallery, she\ndiscerned, all the way to its extremity, those persons whom she ought to\nsalute with the consideration due to their rank; those on whom she should\nbestow an inclination of the head; and lastly, those who were to be\nsatisfied with a smile, calculated to console them for not being entitled\nto greater honours.",
        "Louis XV. was enchanted with the young Dauphiness; all his conversation\nwas about her graces, her vivacity, and the aptness of her repartees.\nShe was yet more successful with the royal family when they beheld her\nshorn of the splendour of the diamonds with which she had been adorned\nduring the first days of her marriage.  When clothed in a light dress of\ngauze or taffety she was compared to the Venus dei Medici, and the\nAtalanta of the Marly Gardens.  Poets sang her charms; painters attempted\nto copy her features.  One artist’s fancy led him to place the portrait\nof Marie Antoinette in the heart of a full-blown rose.  His ingenious\nidea was rewarded by Louis XV.",
        "The King continued to talk only of the Dauphiness; and Madame du Barry\nill-naturedly endeavoured to damp his enthusiasm.  Whenever Marie\nAntoinette was the topic, she pointed out the irregularity of her\nfeatures, criticised the ’bons mots’ quoted as hers, and rallied the King\nupon his prepossession in her favour.  Madame du Barry was affronted at\nnot receiving from the Dauphiness those attentions to which she thought\nherself entitled; she did not conceal her vexation from the King; she was\nafraid that the grace and cheerfulness of the young Princess would make\nthe domestic circle of the royal family more agreeable to the old\nsovereign, and that he would escape her chains; at the same time, hatred\nto the Choiseul party contributed powerfully to excite the enmity of the\nfavourite.",
        "The fall of that minister took place in November, 1770, six months after\nhis long influence in the Council had brought about the alliance with the\nHouse of Austria and the arrival of Marie Antoinette at the Court of\nFrance.  The Princess, young, frank, volatile, and inexperienced, found\nherself without any other guide than the Abbe de Vermond, in a Court\nruled by the enemy of the minister who had brought her there, and in the\nmidst of people who hated Austria, and detested any alliance with the\nimperial house.",
        "The Duc d’Aiguillon, the Duc de La Vauguyon, the Marechal de Richelieu,\nthe Rohans, and other considerable families, who had made use of Madame\ndu Barry to overthrow the Duke, could not flatter themselves,\nnotwithstanding their powerful intrigues, with a hope of being able to\nbreak off an alliance solemnly announced, and involving such high\npolitical interests.  They therefore changed their mode of attack, and it\nwill be seen how the conduct of the Dauphin served as a basis for their\nhopes.",
        "The Dauphiness continually gave proofs of both sense and feeling.\nSometimes she even suffered herself to be carried away by those\ntransports of compassionate kindness which are not to be controlled by\nthe customs which rank establishes.",
        "In consequence of the fire in the Place Louis XV., which occurred at the\ntime of the nuptial entertainments, the Dauphin and Dauphiness sent\ntheir, whole income for the year to the relief of the unfortunate\nfamilies who lost their relatives on that disastrous day.",
        "This was one of those ostentatious acts of generosity which are dictated\nby the policy of princes, at least as much as by their compassion; but\nthe grief of Marie Antoinette was profound, and lasted several days;\nnothing could console her for the loss of so many innocent victims; she\nspoke of it, weeping, to her ladies, one of whom, thinking, no doubt, to\ndivert her mind, told her that a great number of thieves had been found\namong the bodies, and that their pockets were filled with watches and\nother valuables.  “They have at least been well punished,” added the\nperson who related these particulars.  “Oh, no, no, madame!” replied the\nDauphiness; “they died by the side of honest people.”",
        "The Dauphiness had brought from Vienna a considerable number of white\ndiamonds; the King added to them the gift of the diamonds and pearls of\nthe late Dauphiness, and also put into her hands a collar of pearls, of a\nsingle row, the smallest of which was as large as a filbert, and which\nhad been brought into France by Anne of Austria, and appropriated by that\nPrincess to the use of the Queens and Dauphinesses of France.",
        "The three Princesses, daughters of Louis XV., joined in making her\nmagnificent presents.  Madame Adelaide at the same time gave the young\nPrincess a key to the private corridors of the Chateau, by means of\nwhich, without any suite, and without being perceived, she could get to\nthe apartments of her aunts, and see them in private.  The Dauphiness,\non receiving the key, told them, with infinite grace, that if they had\nmeant to make her appreciate the superb presents they were kind enough to\nbestow upon her, they should not at the same time have offered her one of\nsuch inestimable value; since to that key she should be indebted for an\nintimacy and advice unspeakably precious at her age.  She did, indeed,\nmake use of it very frequently; but Madame Victoire alone permitted her,\nso long as she continued Dauphiness, to visit her familiarly.  Madame\nAdelaide could not overcome her prejudices against Austrian princesses,\nand was wearied with the somewhat petulant gaiety of the Dauphiness.\nMadame Victoire was concerned at this, feeling that their society and\ncounsel would have been highly useful to a young person otherwise likely\nto meet with none but sycophants.  She endeavoured, therefore, to induce\nher to take pleasure in the society of the Marquise de Durfort, her lady\nof honour and favourite.  Several agreeable entertainments took place at\nthe house of this lady, but the Comtesse de Noailles and the Abbe de\nVermond soon opposed these meetings.",
        "A circumstance which happened in hunting, near the village of Acheres,\nin the forest of Fontainebleau, afforded the young Princess an\nopportunity of displaying her respect for old age, and her compassion for\nmisfortune.  An aged peasant was wounded by the stag; the Dauphiness\njumped out of her calash, placed the peasant, with his wife and children,\nin it, had the family taken back to their cottage, and bestowed upon them\nevery attention and every necessary assistance.  Her heart was always\nopen to the feelings of compassion, and the recollection of her rank\nnever restrained her sensibility.  Several persons in her service entered\nher room one evening, expecting to find nobody there but the officer in\nwaiting; they perceived the young Princess seated by the side of this\nman, who was advanced in years; she had placed near him a bowl full of\nwater, was stanching the blood which issued from a wound he had received\nin his hand with her handkerchief, which she had torn up to bind it, and\nwas fulfilling towards him all the duties of a pious sister of charity.\nThe old man, affected even to tears, out of respect allowed his august\nmistress to act as she thought proper.  He had hurt himself in\nendeavouring to move a rather heavy piece of furniture at the Princess’s\nrequest.",
        "In the month of July, 1770, an unfortunate occurrence that took place in\na family which the Dauphiness honoured with her favour contributed again\nto show not only her sensibility but also the benevolence of her\ndisposition.  One of her women in waiting had a son who was an officer in\nthe gens d’armes of the guard; this young man thought himself affronted\nby a clerk in the War Department, and imprudently sent him a challenge;\nhe killed his adversary in the forest of Compiegne.  The family of the\nyoung man who was killed, being in possession of the challenge, demanded\njustice.  The King, distressed on account of several duels which had\nrecently taken place, had unfortunately declared that he would show no\nmercy on the first event of that kind which could be proved; the culprit\nwas therefore arrested.  His mother, in the deepest grief, hastened to\nthrow herself at the feet of the Dauphiness, the Dauphin, and the young\nPrincesses.  After an hour’s supplication they obtained from the King the\nfavour so much desired.  On the next day a lady of rank, while\ncongratulating the Dauphiness, had the malice to add that the mother had\nneglected no means of success on the occasion, having solicited not only\nthe royal family, but even Madame du Barry.  The Dauphiness replied that\nthe fact justified the favourable opinion she had formed of the worthy\nwoman; that the heart of a mother should hesitate at nothing for the\nsalvation of her son; and that in her place, if she had thought it would\nbe serviceable, she would have thrown herself at the feet of Zamor.",
        "     [A little Indian who carried the Comtesse du Barry’s train.  Louis\n     XV.  often amused himself with the little marmoset, and jestingly\n     made him Governor of Louveciennes; he received an annual income of\n     3,000 francs.]",
        "Some time after the marriage entertainments the Dauphiness made her entry\ninto Paris, and was received with transports of joy.  After dining in the\nKing’s apartment at the Tuileries, she was forced, by the reiterated\nshouts of the multitude, with whom the garden was filled, to present\nherself upon the balcony fronting the principal walk.  On seeing such a\ncrowd of heads with their eyes fixed upon her, she exclaimed, “Grand-\nDieu! what a concourse!\"–\"Madame,” said the old Duc de Brissac, the\nGovernor of Paris, “I may tell you, without fear of offending the\nDauphin, that they are so many lovers.”  2 The Dauphin took no umbrage at\neither acclamations or marks of homage of which the Dauphiness was the\nobject.  The most mortifying indifference, a coldness which frequently\ndegenerated into rudeness, were the sole feelings which the young Prince\nthen manifested towards her.  Not all her charms could gain even upon his\nsenses.  This estrangement, which lasted a long time, was said to be the\nwork of the Duc de La Vauguyon.",
        "The Dauphiness, in fact, had no sincere friends at Court except the Duc\nde Choiseul and his party.  Will it be credited that the plans laid\nagainst Marie Antoinette went so far as divorce?  I have been assured of\nit by persons holding high situations at Court, and many circumstances\ntend to confirm the opinion.  On the journey to Fontainebleau, in the\nyear of the marriage, the inspectors of public buildings were gained over\nto manage so that the apartment intended for the Dauphin, communicating\nwith that of the Dauphiness, should not be finished, and a room at the\nextremity of the building was temporarily assigned to him.  The\nDauphiness, aware that this was the result of intrigue, had the courage\nto complain of it to Louis XV., who, after severe reprimands, gave orders\nso positive that within the week the apartment was ready.  Every method\nwas tried to continue or augment the indifference which the Dauphin long\nmanifested towards his youthful spouse.  She was deeply hurt at it, but\nshe never suffered herself to utter the slightest complaint on the\nsubject.  Inattention to, even contempt for, the charms which she heard\nextolled on all sides, nothing induced her to break silence; and some\ntears, which would involuntarily burst from her eyes, were the sole\nsymptoms of her inward sufferings discoverable by those in her service.",
        "Once only, when tired out with the misplaced remonstrances of an old lady\nattached to her person, who wished to dissuade her from riding on\nhorseback, under the impression that it would prevent her producing heirs\nto the crown, “Mademoiselle,” said she, “in God’s name, leave me in\npeace; be assured that I can put no heir in danger.”",
        "The Dauphiness found at the Court of Louis XV., besides the three\nPrincesses, the King’s daughters, the Princes also, brothers of the\nDauphin, who were receiving their education, and Clotilde and Elisabeth,\nstill in the care of Madame de Marsan, governess of the children of\nFrance.  The elder of the two latter Princesses, in 1777, married the\nPrince of Piedmont, afterwards King of Sardinia.  This Princess was in\nher infancy, so extremely large that the people nicknamed her ’gros\nMadame.’",
        "     [Madame Clotilde of France, a sister of the King, was\n     extraordinarily fat for her height and age.  One of her playfellows,\n     having been indiscreet enough even in her presence to make use of\n     the nickname given to her, received a severe reprimand from the\n     Comtesse de Marsan, who hinted to her that she would do well in not\n     making her appearance again before the Princess.  Madame Clotilde\n     sent for her the next day: “My governess,” said she, “has done her\n     duty, and I will do mine; come and see me as usual, and think no\n     more of a piece of inadvertence, which I myself have forgotten.\"\n     This Princess, so heavy in body, possessed the most agreeable and\n     playful wit.  Her affability and grace rendered her dear to all who\n     came near her.–NOTE BY THE EDITOR]",
        "The second Princess was the pious Elisabeth, the victim of her respect\nand tender attachment for the King, her brother.  She was still scarcely\nout of her leading-strings at the period of the Dauphin’s marriage.  The\nDauphiness showed her marked preference.  The governess, who sought to\nadvance the Princess to whom nature had been least favourable, was\noffended at the Dauphiness’s partiality for Madame Elisabeth, and by her\ninjudicious complaints weakened the friendship which yet subsisted\nbetween Madame Clotilde and Marie Antoinette.  There even arose some\ndegree of rivalry on the subject of education; and that which the Empress\nMaria Theresa bestowed on her daughters was talked of openly and\nunfavourably enough.  The Abbe de Vermond thought himself affronted,\ntook a part in the quarrel, and added his complaints and jokes to those\nof the Dauphiness on the criticisms of the governess; he even indulged\nhimself in his turn in reflections on the tuition of Madame Clotilde.\nEverything becomes known at Court.  Madame de Marsan was informed of all\nthat had been said in the Dauphiness’s circle, and was very angry with\nher on account of it.",
        "From that moment a centre of intrigue, or rather gossip, against Marie\nAntoinette was established round Madame de Marsan’s fireside; her most\ntrifling actions were there construed ill; her gaiety, and the harmless\namusements in which she sometimes indulged in her own apartments with the\nmore youthful ladies of her train, and even with the women in her\nservice, were stigmatised as criminal.  Prince Louis de Rohan, sent\nthrough the influence of this clique ambassador to Vienna, was the echo\nthere of these unmerited comments, and threw himself into a series of\nculpable accusations which he proffered under the guise of zeal.  He\nceaselessly represented the young Dauphiness as alienating all hearts by\nlevities unsuitable to the dignity of the French Court.  The Princess\nfrequently received from the Court of Vienna remonstrances, of the origin\nof which she could not long remain in ignorance.  From this period must\nbe dated that aversion which she never ceased to manifest for the Prince\nde Rohan.",
        "About the same time the Dauphiness received information of a letter\nwritten by Prince Louis to the Duc d’Aiguillon, in which the ambassador\nexpressed himself in very free language respecting the intentions of\nMaria Theresa with relation to the partition of Poland.  This letter of\nPrince Louis had been read at the Comtesse du Barry’s; the levity of the\nambassador’s correspondence wounded the feelings and the dignity of the\nDauphiness at Versailles, while at Vienna the representations which he\nmade to Maria Theresa against the young Princess terminated in rendering\nthe motives of his incessant complaints suspected by the Empress.",
        "Maria Theresa at length determined on sending her private secretary,\nBaron de Neni, to Versailles, with directions to observe the conduct of\nthe Dauphiness with attention, and form a just estimate of the opinion of\nthe Court and of Paris with regard to that Princess.  The Baron de Neni,\nafter having devoted sufficient time and intelligence to the subject,\nundeceived his sovereign as to the exaggerations of the French\nambassador; and the Empress had no difficulty in detecting, among the\ncalumnies which he had conveyed to her under the specious excuse of\nanxiety for her august daughter, proofs of the enmity of a, party which\nhad never approved of the alliance of the House of Bourbon with her own.",
        "At this period the Dauphiness, though unable to obtain any influence over\nthe heart of her husband, dreading Louis XV., and justly mistrusting\neverything connected with Madame du Barry and the Duc d’Aiguillon, had\nnot deserved the slightest reproach for that sort of levity which hatred\nand her misfortunes afterwards construed into crime.  The Empress,\nconvinced of the innocence of Marie Antoinette, directed the Baron de\nNeni to solicit the recall of the Prince de Rohan, and to inform the\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of all the motives which made her require\nit; but the House of Rohan interposed between its protege and the\nAustrian envoy, and an evasive answer merely was given.",
        "It was not until two months after the death of Louis XV.  that the Court\nof Vienna obtained his recall.  The avowed grounds for requiring it were,\nfirst, the public gallantries of Prince Louis with some ladies of the\nCourt and others; secondly, his surliness and haughtiness towards other\nforeign ministers, which would have had more serious consequences,\nespecially with the ministers of England and Denmark, if the Empress\nherself had not interfered; thirdly, his contempt for religion in a\ncountry where it was particularly necessary to show respect for it.\nHe had been seen frequently to dress himself in clothes of different\ncolours, assuming the hunting uniforms of various noblemen whom he\nvisited, with so much audacity that one day in particular, during the\nFete-Dieu, he and all his legation, in green uniforms laced with gold,\nbroke through a procession which impeded them, in order to make their way\nto a hunting party at the Prince de Paar’s; and fourthly, the immense\ndebts contracted by him and his people, which were tardily and only in\npart discharged.",
        "The succeeding marriages of the Comte de Provence and the Comte d’Artois\nwith two daughters of the King of Sardinia procured society for the\nDauphiness more suitable to her age, and altered her mode of life.",
        "A pair of tolerably fine eyes drew forth, in favour of the Comtesse de\nProvence, upon her arrival at Versailles, the only praises which could\nreasonably be bestowed upon her.  The Comtesse d’Artois, though not\ndeformed, was very small; she had a fine complexion; her face, tolerably\npleasing, was not remarkable for anything except the extreme length of\nthe nose.  But being good and generous, she was beloved by those about\nher, and even possessed some influence so long as she was the only\nPrincess who had produced heirs to the crown.",
        "From this time the closest intimacy subsisted between the three young\nfamilies.  They took their meals together, except on those days when they\ndined in public.  This manner of living en famille continued until the\nQueen sometimes indulged herself in going to dine with the Duchesse de\nPolignac, when she was governess; but the evening meetings at supper were\nnever interrupted; they took place at the house of the Comtesse de\nProvence.  Madame Elisabeth made one of the party when she had finished\nher education, and sometimes Mesdames, the King’s aunts, were invited.\nThe custom, which had no precedent at Court, was the work of Marie\nAntoinette, and she maintained it with the utmost perseverance.",
        "The Court of Versailles saw no change in point of etiquette during the\nreign of Louis XV.  Play took place at the house of the Dauphiness, as\nbeing the first lady of the State.  It had, from the death of Queen Maria\nLeczinska to the marriage of the Dauphin, been held at the abode of\nMadame Adelade.  This removal, the result of an order of precedence not\nto be violated, was not the less displeasing to Madame Adelaide, who\nestablished a separate party for play in her apartments, and scarcely\never went to that which not only the Court in general, but also the royal\nfamily, were expected to attend.  The full-dress visits to the King on\nhis ’debotter’ were continued.  High mass was attended daily.  The\nairings of the Princesses were nothing more than rapid races in berlins,\nduring which they were accompanied by Body Guards, equerries, and pages\non horseback.  They galloped for some leagues from Versailles.  Calashes\nwere used only in hunting.",
        "The young Princesses were desirous to infuse animation into their circle\nof associates by something useful as well as pleasant.  They adopted the\nplan of learning and performing all the best plays of the French theatre.\nThe Dauphin was the only spectator.  The three Princesses, the two\nbrothers of the King, and Messieurs Campan, father and son, were the sole\nperformers, but they endeavoured to keep this amusement as secret as an\naffair of State; they dreaded the censure of Mesdames, and they had no\ndoubt that Louis XV. would forbid such pastimes if he knew of them.  They\nselected for their performance a cabinet in the entresol which nobody had\noccasion to enter.",
        "A kind of proscenium, which could be taken down and shut up in a closet,\nformed the whole theatre.  The Comte de Provence always knew his part\nwith imperturbable accuracy; the Comte d’Artois knew his tolerably well,\nand recited elegantly; the Princesses acted badly.  The Dauphiness\nacquitted herself in some characters with discrimination and feeling.\nThe chief pleasure of this amusement consisted in all the costumes being\nelegant and accurate.  The Dauphin entered into the spirit of these\ndiversions, and laughed heartily at the comic characters as they came on\nthe scene; from these amusements may be dated his discontinuance of the\ntimid manner of his youth, and his taking pleasure in the society of the\nDauphiness.",
        "It was not till a long time afterwards that I learnt these particulars,\nM. Campan having kept the secret; but an unforeseen event had well-nigh\nexposed the whole mystery.  One day the Queen desired M. Campan to go\ndown into her closet to fetch something that she had forgotten; he was\ndressed for the character of Crispin, and was rouged.  A private\nstaircase led direct to the entresol through the dressing-room.  M.\nCampan fancied he heard some noise, and remained still, behind the door,\nwhich was shut.  A servant belonging to the wardrobe, who was, in fact,\non the staircase, had also heard some noise, and, either from fear or\ncuriosity, he suddenly opened the door; the figure of Crispin frightened\nhim so that he fell down backwards, shouting with his might, “Help!\nhelp!”  My father-in-law raised him up, made him recognise his voice,\nand laid upon him an injunction of silence as to what he had seen.\nHe felt himself, however, bound to inform the Dauphiness of what had\nhappened, and she was afraid that a similar occurrence might betray their\namusements.  They were therefore discontinued.",
        "The Princess occupied her time in her own apartment in the study of music\nand the parts in plays which she had to learn; the latter exercise, at\nleast, produced the beneficial effect of strengthening her memory and\nfamiliarising her with the French language.",
        "While Louis XV.  reigned, the enemies of Marie Antoinette made no attempt\nto change public opinion with regard to her.  She was always popular with\nthe French people in general, and particularly with the inhabitants of\nParis, who went on every opportunity to Versailles, the majority of them\nattracted solely by the pleasure of seeing her.  The courtiers did not\nfully enter into the popular enthusiasm which the Dauphiness had\ninspired; the disgrace of the Duc de Choiseul had removed her real\nsupport from her; and the party which had the ascendency at Court since\nthe exile of that minister was, politically, as much opposed to her\nfamily as to herself.  The Dauphiness was therefore surrounded by enemies\nat Versailles.",
        "Nevertheless everybody appeared outwardly desirous to please her; for the\nage of Louis XV., and the apathetic character of the Dauphin,\nsufficiently warned courtiers of the important part reserved for the\nPrincess during the following reign, in case the Dauphin should become\nattached to her.",
        "About the beginning of May, 1774, Louis XV., the strength of whose\nconstitution had promised a long enough life, was attacked by confluent\nsmallpox of the worst kind.  Mesdames at this juncture inspired the\nDauphiness with a feeling of respect and attachment, of which she gave\nthem repeated proofs when she ascended the throne.  In fact, nothing was\nmore admirable nor more affecting than the courage with which they braved\nthat most horrible disease.  The air of the palace was infected; more\nthan fifty persons took the smallpox, in consequence of having merely\nloitered in the galleries of Versailles, and ten died of it.",
        "The end of the monarch was approaching.  His reign, peaceful in general,\nhad inherited strength from the power of his predecessor; on the other\nhand, his own weakness had been preparing misfortune for whoever should\nreign after him.  The scene was about to change; hope, ambition, joy,\ngrief, and all those feelings which variously affected the hearts of the\ncourtiers, sought in vain to disguise themselves under a calm exterior.\nIt was easy to detect the different motives which induced them every\nmoment to repeat to every one the question: “How is the King?”  At\nlength, on the 10th of May, 1774, the mortal career of Louis XV.\nterminated.",
        "     [Christopher de Beaumont, Archbishop of Paris, the ardent apostle of\n     frequent communion, arrived at Paris with the intention of\n     soliciting, in public, the administration of the sacrament to the\n     King, and secretly retarding it as much as possible.  The ceremony\n     could not take place without the previous and public expulsion of\n     the, concubine, according to the canons of the Church and the\n     Jesuitical party, of which Christopher was the leader.  This party,\n     which had made use of Madame du Barry to suppress the Parliaments,\n     to support the Duc d’Aiguillon, and ruin the Choiseul faction, could\n     not willingly consent to disgrace her canonically.  The Archbishop\n     went into the King’s bedchamber, and found there Madame Adelaide,\n     the Duc d’Aumont, the Bishop of Senlis, and Richelieu, in whose\n     presence he resolved not to say one word about confession for that\n     day.  This reticence so encouraged Louis XV. that, on the Archbishop\n     withdrawing, he had Madame du Barry called in, and kissed her\n     beautiful hands again with his wonted affection.  On the 2d of May\n     the King found himself a little better.  Madame du Barry had brought\n     him two confidential physicians, Lorry and Borden, who were enjoined\n     to conceal the nature of his sickness from him in order to keep off\n     the priests and save her from a humiliating dismissal.  The King’s\n     improvement allowed Madame du Barry to divert him by her usual\n     playfulness and conversation.  But La Martiniere, who was of the\n     Choiseul party, and to whom they durst not refuse his right of\n     entry, did not conceal from the King either the nature or the danger\n     of his sickness.  The King then sent for Madame du Barry, and said\n     to her: “My love, I have got the smallpox, and my illness is very\n     dangerous on account of my age and other disorders.  I ought not to\n     forget that I am the most Christian King, and the eldest son of the\n     Church.  I am sixty-four; the time is perhaps approaching when we\n     must separate.  I wish to prevent a scene like that of Metz.\"\n     (when, in 1744, he had dismissed the Duchesse de Chateauroux.)\n     “Apprise the Duc d’Aiguillon of what I say, that he may arrange with\n     you if my sickness grows worse; so that we may part without any\n     publicity.”  The Jansenists and the Duc de Choiseurs party publicly\n     said that M. d’Aiguillon and the Archbishop had resolved to let the\n     King die without receiving the sacrament rather than disturb Madame\n     du Barry.  Annoyed by their remarks, Beaumont determined to go and\n     reside at the Lazaristes, his house at Versailles, to avail himself\n     of the King’s last moments, and sacrifice Madame du Barry when the\n     monarch’s condition should become desperate.  He arrived on the 3d\n     of May, but did not see the King.  Under existing circumstances, his\n     object was to humble the enemies of his party and to support the\n     favourite who had assisted to overcome them.",
        "     A contrary zeal animated the Bishop of Carcassonne, who urged that\n     “the King ought to receive the sacrament; and by expelling the\n     concubine to give an example of repentance to France and Christian\n     Europe, which he had scandalised.\"–” By what right,” said Cardinal\n     de la Roche-Aymon, a complaisant courtier with whom the Bishop was\n     at daggers drawn, “do you instruct me?\"–\"There is my authority,\"\n     replied the Bishop, holding up his pectoral cross.  “Learn,\n     monseigneur, to respect it, and do not suffer your King to die\n     without the sacraments of the Church, of which he is the eldest\n     son.”  The Duc d’Aiguillon and the Archbishop, who witnessed the\n     discussion, put an end to it by asking for the King’s orders\n     relative to Madame du Barry.  “She must be taken quietly to your\n     seat at Ruelle,” said the King; “I shall be grateful for the care\n     Madame d’Aiguillon may take of her.”",
        "     Madame du Barry saw the King again for a moment on the evening of\n     the 4th, and promised to return to Court upon his recovery.  She was\n     scarcely gone when the King asked for her.  “She is gone,” was the\n     answer.  From that moment the disorder gained ground; he thought\n     himself a dead man, without the possibility of recovery.  The 5th\n     and 6th passed without a word of confession, viaticum, or extreme\n     unction.  The Duc de Fronsac threatened to throw the Cure of\n     Versailles out of the window if he dared to mention them, but on the\n     7th, at three in the morning, the King imperatively called for the\n     Abbe Maudous.  Confession lasted seventeen minutes.  The Ducs de la\n     Vrillilere and d’Aiguillon wished to delay the viaticum; but La\n     Martiniere said to the King: “Sire, I have seen your Majesty in very\n     trying circumstances; but never admired you as I have done to-day.\n     No doubt your Majesty will immediately finish what you have so well\n     begun.”  The King had his confessor Maudoua called back; this was a\n     poor priest who had been placed about him for some years before\n     because he was old and blind.  He gave him absolution.",
        "     The formal renunciation desired by the Choiseul party, in order to\n     humble and annihilate Madame du Barry with solemnity, was no more\n     mentioned.  The grand almoner, in concert with the Archbishop,\n     composed this formula, pronounced in presence of the viaticum:\n     “Although the King owes an account of his conduct to none but God,\n     he declares his repentance at having scandalised his subjects, and\n     is desirous to live solely for the maintenance of religion and the\n     happiness of his people.”",
        "     On the 8th and 9th the disorder grew worse; and the King beheld the\n     whole surface of his body coming off piecemeal and corrupted.\n     Deserted by his friends and by that crowd of courtiers which had so\n     long cringed before him, his only consolation was the piety of his\n     daughters.–SOULAVIE, “Historical and Political Memoirs,” vol. i.]",
        "The Comtesse du Barry had, a few days previously, withdrawn to Ruelle, to\nthe Duc d’Aiguillon’s.  Twelve or fifteen persons belonging to the Court\nthought it their duty to visit her there; their liveries were observed,\nand these visits were for a long time grounds for disfavour.  More than\nsix years after the King’s death one of these persons being spoken of in\nthe circle of the royal family, I heard it remarked, “That was one of the\nfifteen Ruelle carriages.”",
        "The whole Court went to the Chateau; the oiel-de boeuf was filled with\ncourtiers, and the palace with the inquisitive.  The Dauphin had settled\nthat he would depart with the royal family the moment the King should\nbreathe his last sigh.  But on such an occasion decency forbade that\npositive orders for departure should be passed from mouth to mouth.  The\nheads of the stables, therefore, agreed with the people who were in the\nKing’s room, that the latter should place a lighted taper near a window,\nand that at the instant of the King’s decease one of them should\nextinguish it.",
        "The taper was extinguished.  On this signal the Body Guards, pages, and\nequerries mounted on horseback, and all was ready for setting off.  The\nDauphin was with the Dauphiness.  They were expecting together the\nintelligence of the death of Louis XV.  A dreadful noise, absolutely like\nthunder, was heard in the outer apartment; it was the crowd of courtiers\nwho were deserting the dead sovereign’s antechamber, to come and do\nhomage to the new power of Louis XVI.  This extraordinary tumult informed\nMarie Antoinette and her husband that they were called to the throne;\nand, by a spontaneous movement, which deeply affected those around them,\nthey threw themselves on their knees; both, pouring forth a flood of\ntears, exclaimed: “O God! guide us, protect us; we are too young to\nreign.”",
        "The Comtesse de Noailles entered, and was the first to salute Marie\nAntoinette as Queen of France.  She requested their Majesties to\ncondescend to quit the inner apartments for the grand salon, to receive\nthe Princes and all the great officers, who were desirous to do homage to\ntheir new sovereigns.  Marie Antoinette received these first visits\nleaning upon her husband, with her handkerchief held to her eyes; the\ncarriages drove up, the guards and equerries were on horseback.  The\nChateau was deserted; every one hastened to fly from contagion, which\nthere was no longer any inducement to brave.",
        "On leaving the chamber of Louis XV., the Duc de Villequier, first\ngentleman of the bedchamber for the year, ordered M. Andouille, the\nKing’s chief surgeon, to open the body and embalm it.  The chief surgeon\nwould inevitably have died in consequence.  “I am ready,” replied\nAndouille; “but while I operate you shall hold the head; your office\nimposes this duty upon you.”  The Duke went off without saying a word,\nand the corpse was neither opened nor embalmed.  A few under-servants and\nworkmen continued with the pestiferous remains, and paid the last duty to\ntheir master; the surgeons directed that spirits of wine should be poured\ninto the coffin.",
        "The entire Court set off for Choisy at four o’clock; Mesdames the King’s\naunts in their private carriage, and the Princesses under tuition with\nthe Comtesse de Marsan and the under-governesses.  The King, the Queen,\nMonsieur, the King’s brother, Madame, and the Comte and Comtesse d’Artois\nwent in the same carriage.  The solemn scene that had just passed before\ntheir eyes, the multiplied ideas offered to their imaginations by that\nwhich was just opening, had naturally inclined them to grief and\nreflection; but, by the Queen’s own confession, this inclination, little\nsuited to their age, wholly left them before they had gone half their\njourney; a word, drolly mangled by the Comtesse d’Artois, occasioned a\ngeneral burst of laughter; and from that moment they dried their tears.",
        "The communication between Choisy and Paris was incessant; never was a\nCourt seen in greater agitation.  What influence will the royal aunts\nhave,–and the Queen?  What fate is reserved for the Comtesse du Barry?\nWhom will the young King choose for his ministers?  All these questions\nwere answered in a few days.  It was determined that the King’s youth\nrequired a confidential person near him; and that there should be a prime\nminister.  All eyes were turned upon De Machault and De Maurepas, both of\nthem much advanced in years.  The first had retired to his estate near\nParis; and the second to Pont Chartrain, to which place he had long been\nexiled.  The letter recalling M. de Machault was written, when Madame\nAdelaide obtained the preference of that important appointment for M. de\nMaurepas.  The page to whose care the first letter had been actually\nconsigned was recalled.",
        "The Duc d’Aiguillon had been too openly known as the private friend of\nthe King’s mistress; he was dismissed.  M. de Vergennes, at that time\nambassador of France at Stockholm, was appointed Minister for Foreign\nAffairs; Comte du Muy, the intimate friend of the Dauphin, the father of\nLouis XVI.[?? D.W.], obtained the War Department.  The Abbe Terray in\nvain said, and wrote, that he had boldly done all possible injury to the\ncreditors of the State during the reign of the late King; that order was\nrestored in the finances; that nothing but what was beneficial to all\nparties remained to be done; and that the new Court was about to enjoy\nthe advantages of the regenerating part of his plan of finance; all these\nreasons, set forth in five or six memorials, which he sent in succession\nto the King and Queen, did not avail to keep him in office.  His talents\nwere admitted, but the odium which his operations had necessarily brought\nupon his character, combined with the immorality of his private life,\nforbade his further stay at Court; he was succeeded by M. de Clugny.  De\nMaupeou, the chancellor, was exiled; this caused universal joy.  Lastly,\nthe reassembling of the Parliaments produced the strongest sensation;\nParis was in a delirium of joy, and not more than one person in a hundred\nforesaw that the spirit of the ancient magistracy would be still the\nsame; and that in a short time it would make new attempts upon the royal\nauthority.  Madame du Barry had been exiled to Pont-aux-Dames.  This was\na measure rather of necessity than of severity; a short period of\ncompulsory retreat was requisite in order completely to break off her\nconnections with State affairs.  The possession of Louveciennes and a\nconsiderable pension were continued to her.",
        "     [The Comtesse du Barry never forgot the mild treatment she\n     experienced from the Court of Louis XVI.; during the most violent\n     convulsions of the Revolution she signified to the Queen that there\n     was no one in France more grieved at the sufferings of her sovereign\n     than herself; that the honour she had for years enjoyed, of living\n     near the throne, and the unbounded kindness of the King and Queen,\n     had so sincerely attached her to the cause of royalty that she\n     entreated the Queen to honour her by disposing of all she possessed.\n     Though they did not accept her offer, their Majesties were affected\n     at her gratitude.  The Comtesse du Barry was, as is well known, one\n     of the victims of the Revolution.  She betrayed at the last great\n     weakness, and the most ardent desire to live.  She was the only\n     woman who wept upon the scaffold and implored for mercy.  Her beauty\n     and tears made an impression on the populace, and the execution was\n     hurried to a conclusion.–MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "Everybody expected the recall of M. de Choiseul; the regret occasioned\nby his absence among the numerous friends whom he had left at Court,\nthe attachment of the young Princess who was indebted to him for her\nelevation to the throne of France, and all concurring circumstances,\nseemed to foretell his return; the Queen earnestly entreated it of the\nKing, but she met with an insurmountable and unforeseen obstacle.  The\nKing, it is said, had imbibed the strongest prejudices against that\nminister, from secret memoranda penned by his father, and which had been\ncommitted to the care of the Duc de La Vauguyon, with an injunction to\nplace them in his hands as soon as he should be old enough to study the\nart of reigning.  It was by these memoranda that the esteem which he had\nconceived for the Marechal du Muy was inspired, and we may add that\nMadame Adelaide, who at this early period powerfully influenced the\ndecisions of the young monarch, confirmed the impressions they had made.",
        "The Queen conversed with M. Campan on the regret she felt at having been\nunable to procure the recall of M. de Choiseul, and disclosed the cause\nof it to him.  The Abbe de Vermond, who, down to the time of the death of\nLouis XV., had been on terms of the strictest friendship with M. Campan,\ncalled upon him on the second day after the arrival of the Court at\nChoisy, and, assuming a serious air, said, “Monsieur, the Queen was\nindiscreet enough yesterday to speak to you of a minister to whom she\nmust of course be attached, and whom his friends ardently desire to have\nnear her; you are aware that we must give up all expectation of seeing\nthe Duke at Court; you know the reasons why; but you do not know that the\nyoung Queen, having mentioned the conversation in question to me, it was\nmy duty, both as her preceptor and her friend, to remonstrate severely\nwith her on her indiscretion in communicating to you those particulars of\nwhich you are in possession.  I am now come to tell you that if you\ncontinue to avail yourself of the good nature of your mistress to\ninitiate yourself in secrets of State, you will have me for your most\ninveterate enemy.  The Queen should find here no other confidant than\nmyself respecting things that ought to remain secret.”  M. Campan\nanswered that he did not covet the important and dangerous character at\nthe new Court which the Abbe wished to appropriate; and that he should\nconfine himself to the duties of his office, being sufficiently satisfied\nwith the continued kindness with which the Queen honoured him.\nNotwithstanding this, however, he informed the Queen, on the very same\nevening, of the injunction he had received.  She owned that she had\nmentioned their conversation to the Abbe; that he had indeed seriously\nscolded her, in order to make her feel the necessity of being secret in\nconcerns of State; and she added, “The Abbe cannot like you, my dear\nCampan; he did not expect that I should, on my arrival in France, find in\nmy household a man who would suit me so exactly as you have done.  I know\nthat he has taken umbrage at it; that is enough.  I know, too, that you\nare incapable of attempting anything to injure him in my esteem; an\nattempt which would besides be vain, for I have been too long attached to\nhim.  As to yourself, be easy on the score of the Abbe’s hostility, which\nshall not in any way hurt you.”",
        "The Abbe de Vermond having made himself master of the office of sole\nconfidant to the Queen, was nevertheless agitated whenever he saw the\nyoung King; he could not be ignorant that the Abbe had been promoted by\nthe Duc de Choiseul, and was believed to favour the Encyclopedists,\nagainst whom Louis XVI.  entertained a secret prejudice, although he\nsuffered them to gain so great an ascendency during his reign.  The Abbe\nhad, moreover, observed that the King had never, while Dauphin, addressed\na single word to him; and that he very frequently only answered him with\na shrug of the shoulders.  He therefore determined on writing to Louis\nXVI., and intimating that he owed his situation at Court solely to the\nconfidence with which the late King had honoured him; and that as habits\ncontracted during the Queen’s education placed him continually in the\nclosest intimacy with her, he could not enjoy the honour of remaining\nnear her Majesty without the King’s consent.  Louis XVI. sent back his\nletter, after writing upon it these words: “I approve the Abbe de Vermond\ncontinuing in his office about the Queen.”",
        "At the period of his grandfather’s death, Louis XVI. began to be\nexceedingly attached to the Queen.  The first period of so deep a\nmourning not admitting of indulgence in the diversion of hunting, he\nproposed to her walks in the gardens of Choisy; they went out like\nhusband and wife, the young King giving his arm to the Queen, and\naccompanied by a very small suite.  The influence of this example had\nsuch an effect upon the courtiers that the next day several couples, who\nhad long, and for good reasons, been disunited, were seen walking upon\nthe terrace with the same apparent conjugal intimacy.  Thus they spent\nwhole hours, braving the intolerable wearisomeness of their protracted\ntete-a-tetes, out of mere obsequious imitation.",
        "The devotion of Mesdames to the King their father throughout his dreadful\nmalady had produced that effect upon their health which was generally\napprehended.  On the fourth day after their arrival at Choisy they were\nattacked by pains in the head and chest, which left no doubt as to the\ndanger of their situation.  It became necessary instantly to send away\nthe young royal family; and the Chateau de la Muette, in the Bois de\nBoulogne, was selected for their reception.  Their arrival at that\nresidence, which was very near Paris, drew so great a concourse of people\ninto its neighbourhood, that even at daybreak the crowd had begun to\nassemble round the gates.  Shouts of “Vive le Roi!”  were scarcely\ninterrupted for a moment between six o’clock in the morning and sunset.\nThe unpopularity the late King, had drawn upon himself during his latter\nyears, and the hopes to which a new reign gives birth, occasioned these\ntransports of joy.",
        "A fashionable jeweller made a fortune by the sale of mourning snuff-\nboxes, whereon the portrait of the young Queen, in a black frame of\nshagreen, gave rise to the pun: “Consolation in chagrin.”  All the\nfashions, and every article of dress, received names expressing the\nspirit of the moment.  Symbols of abundance were everywhere represented,\nand the head-dresses of the ladies were surrounded by ears of wheat.\nPoets sang of the new monarch; all hearts, or rather all heads, in France\nwere filled with enthusiasm.  Never did the commencement of any reign\nexcite more unanimous testimonials of love and attachment.  It must be\nobserved, however, that, amidst all this intoxication, the anti-Austrian\nparty never lost sight of the young Queen, but kept on the watch, with\nthe malicious desire to injure her through such errors as might arise\nfrom her youth and inexperience.",
        "Their Majesties had to receive at La Muette the condolences of the ladies\nwho had been presented at Court, who all felt themselves called on to pay\nhomage to the new sovereigns.  Old and young hastened to present\nthemselves on the day of general reception; little black bonnets with\ngreat wings, shaking heads, low curtsies, keeping time with the motions\nof the head, made, it must be admitted, a few venerable dowagers appear\nsomewhat ridiculous; but the Queen, who possessed a great deal of\ndignity, and a high respect for decorum, was not guilty of the grave\nfault of losing the state she was bound to preserve.  An indiscreet piece\nof drollery of one of the ladies of the palace, however, procured her the\nimputation of doing so.  The Marquise de Clermont-Tonnerre, whose office\nrequired that she should continue standing behind the Queen, fatigued by\nthe length of the ceremony, seated herself on the floor, concealed behind\nthe fence formed by the hoops of the Queen and the ladies of the palace.\nThus seated, and wishing to attract attention and to appear lively, she\ntwitched the dresses of those ladies, and played a thousand other tricks.\nThe contrast of these childish pranks with the solemnity which reigned\nover the rest of the Queen’s chamber disconcerted her Majesty: she\nseveral times placed her fan before her face to hide an involuntary\nsmile, and the severe old ladies pronounced that the young Queen had\ndecided all those respectable persons who were pressing forward to pay\ntheir homage to her; that she liked none but the young; that she was\ndeficient in decorum; and that not one of them would attend her Court\nagain.  The epithet ’moqueuse’ was applied to her; and there is no\nepithet less favourably received in the world.",
        "The next day a very ill-natured song was circulated; the stamp of the\nparty to which it was attributable might easily be seen upon it.  I\nremember only the following chorus:",
        "                   “Little Queen, you must not be\n                    So saucy, with your twenty years;\n                    Your ill-used courtiers soon will see\n                    You pass, once more, the barriers.\n                    Fal lal lal, fal lal la.”",
        "The errors of the great, or those which ill-nature chooses to impute to\nthem, circulate in the world with the greatest rapidity, and become\nhistorical traditions, which every one delights to repeat.",
        "More than fifteen years after this occurrence I heard some old ladies in\nthe most retired part of Auvergne relating all the particulars of the day\nof public condolence for the late King, on which, as they said, the Queen\nhad laughed in the faces of the sexagenarian duchesses and princesses who\nhad thought it their duty to appear on the occasion.",
        "The King and the Princes, his brothers, determined to avail themselves of\nthe advantages held out by inoculation, as a safeguard against the\nillness under which their grandfather had just fallen; but the utility of\nthis new discovery not being then generally acknowledged in France, many\npersons were greatly alarmed at the step; those who blamed it openly\nthrew all the responsibility of it upon the Queen, who alone, they said,\ncould have ventured to give such rash advice, inoculation being at this\ntime established in the Northern Courts.  The operation upon the King and\nhis brothers, performed by Doctor Jauberthou, was fortunately quite\nsuccessful.",
        "When the convalescence of the Princes was perfectly established, the\nexcursions to Marly became cheerful enough.  Parties on horseback and in\ncalashes were formed continually.  The Queen was desirous to afford\nherself one very innocent gratification; she had never seen the day\nbreak; and having now no other consent than that of the King to seek,\nshe intimated her wish to him.  He agreed that she should go, at three\no’clock in the morning, to the eminences of the gardens of Marly; and,\nunfortunately, little disposed to partake in her amusements, he himself\nwent to bed.  Foreseeing some inconveniences possible in this nocturnal\nparty, the Queen determined on having a number of people with her; and\neven ordered her waiting women to accompany her.  All precautions were\nineffectual to prevent the effects of calumny, which thenceforward sought\nto diminish the general attachment that she had inspired.  A few days\nafterwards, the most wicked libel that appeared during the earlier years\nof her reign was circulated in Paris.  The blackest colours were employed\nto paint an enjoyment so harmless that there is scarcely a young woman\nliving in the country who has not endeavoured to procure it for herself.\nThe verses which appeared on this occasion were entitled “Sunrise.”",
        "The Duc d’Orleans, then Duc de Chartres, was among those who accompanied\nthe young Queen in her nocturnal ramble: he appeared very attentive to\nher at this epoch; but it was the only moment of his life in which there\nwas any advance towards intimacy between the Queen and himself.  The King\ndisliked the character of the Duc de Chartres, and the Queen always\nexcluded him from her private society.  It is therefore without the\nslightest foundation that some writers have attributed to feelings of\njealousy or wounded self-love the hatred which he displayed towards the\nQueen during the latter years of their existence.",
        "It was on this first journey to Marly that Boehmer, the jeweller,\nappeared at Court,–a man whose stupidity and avarice afterwards fatally\naffected the happiness and reputation of Marie Antoinette.  This person\nhad, at great expense, collected six pear-formed diamonds of a prodigious\nsize; they were perfectly matched and of the finest water.  The earrings\nwhich they composed had, before the death of Louis XV., been destined for\nthe Comtesse du Barry.",
        "Boehmer; by the recommendation of several persons about the Court, came\nto offer these jewels to the Queen.  He asked four hundred thousand\nfrancs for them.  The young Princess could not withstand her wish to\npurchase them; and the King having just raised the Queen’s income, which,\nunder the former reign, had been but two hundred thousand livres, to one\nhundred thousand crowns a year, she wished to make the purchase out of\nher own purse, and not burthen the royal treasury with the payment.  She\nproposed to Boehmer to take off the two buttons which formed the tops of\nthe clusters, as they could be replaced by two of her own diamonds.  He\nconsented, and then reduced the price of the earrings to three hundred\nand sixty thousand francs; the payment for which was to be made by\ninstalments, and was discharged in the course of four or five years by\nthe Queen’s first femme de chambre, deputed to manage the funds of her\nprivy purse.  I have omitted no details as to the manner in which the\nQueen first became possessed of these jewels, deeming them very needful\nto place in its true light the too famous circumstance of the necklace,\nwhich happened near the end of her reign.",
        "It was also on this first journey to Marly that the Duchesse de Chartres,\nafterwards Duchesse d’Orleans, introduced into the Queen’s household\nMademoiselle Bertin, a milliner who became celebrated at that time for\nthe total change she effected in the dress of the French ladies.",
        "It may be said that the mere admission of a milliner into the house of\nthe Queen was followed by evil consequences to her Majesty.  The skill of\nthe milliner, who was received into the household, in spite of the custom\nwhich kept persons of her description out of it, afforded her the\nopportunity of introducing some new fashion every day.  Up to this time\nthe Queen had shown very plain taste in dress; she now began to make it a\nprincipal occupation; and she was of course imitated by other women.",
        "All wished instantly to have the same dress as the Queen, and to wear the\nfeathers and flowers to which her beauty, then in its brilliancy,\nlent an indescribable charm.  The expenditure of the younger ladies was\nnecessarily much increased; mothers and husbands murmured at it; some few\ngiddy women contracted debts; unpleasant domestic scenes occurred;\nin many families coldness or quarrels arose; and the general report\nwas,–that the Queen would be the ruin of all the French ladies.",
        "Fashion continued its fluctuating progress; and head-dresses, with their\nsuperstructures of gauze, flowers, and feathers, became so lofty that the\nwomen could not find carriages high enough to admit them; and they were\noften seen either stooping, or holding their heads out of the windows.\nOthers knelt down in order to manage these elevated objects of ridicule\nwith less danger.",
        "     [If the use of these extravagant feathers and head-dresses had\n     continued, say the memoirs of that period very seriously, it would\n     have effected a revolution in architecture.  It would have been\n     found necessary to raise the doors and ceilings of the boxes at the\n     theatre, and particularly the bodies of carriages.  It was not\n     without mortification that the King observed the Queen’s adoption of\n     this style of dress: she was never so lovely in his eyes as when\n     unadorned by art.  One day Carlin, performing at Court as harlequin,\n     stuck in his hat, instead of the rabbit’s tail, its prescribed\n     ornament, a peacock’s feather of excessive length.  This new\n     appendage, which repeatedly got entangled among the scenery, gave\n     him an opportunity for a great deal of buffoonery.  There was some\n     inclination to punish him; but it was presumed that he had not\n     assumed the feather without authority.-NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]",
        "Innumerable caricatures, exhibited in all directions, and some of which\nartfully gave the features of the Queen, attacked the extravagance of\nfashion, but with very little effect.  It changed only, as is always the\ncase, through the influence of inconstancy and time.",
        "The Queen’s toilet was a masterpiece of etiquette; everything was done in\na prescribed form.  Both the dame d’honneur and the dame d’atours usually\nattended and officiated, assisted by the first femme de chambre and two\nordinary women.  The dame d’atours put on the petticoat, and handed the\ngown to the Queen.  The dame d’honneur poured out the water for her hands\nand put on her linen.  When a princess of the royal family happened to be\npresent while the Queen was dressing, the dame d’honneur yielded to her\nthe latter act of office, but still did not yield it directly to the\nPrincesses of the blood; in such a case the dame d’honneur was accustomed\nto present the linen to the first femme de chambre, who, in her turn,\nhanded it to the Princess of the blood.  Each of these ladies observed\nthese rules scrupulously as affecting her rights.  One winter’s day it\nhappened that the Queen, who was entirely undressed, was just going to\nput on her shift; I held it ready unfolded for her; the dame d’honneur\ncame in, slipped off her gloves, and took it.  A scratching was heard at\nthe door; it was opened, and in came the Duchesse d’Orleans: her gloves\nwere taken off, and she came forward to take the garment; but as it would\nhave been wrong in the dame d’honneur to hand it to her she gave it to\nme, and I handed it to the Princess.  More scratching it was Madame la\nComtesse de Provence; the Duchesse d’Orleans handed her the linen.  All\nthis while the Queen kept her arms crossed upon her bosom, and appeared\nto feel cold; Madame observed her uncomfortable situation, and, merely\nlaying down her handkerchief without taking off her gloves, she put on\nthe linen, and in doing so knocked the Queen’s cap off.  The Queen\nlaughed to conceal her impatience, but not until she had muttered several\ntimes, “How disagreeable!  how tiresome!”",
        "All this etiquette, however inconvenient, was suitable to the royal\ndignity, which expects to find servants in all classes of persons,\nbeginning even with the brothers and sisters of the monarch.",
        "Speaking here of etiquette, I do not allude to majestic state, appointed\nfor days of ceremony in all Courts.  I mean those minute ceremonies that\nwere pursued towards our Kings in their inmost privacies, in their hours\nof pleasure, in those of pain, and even during the most revolting of\nhuman infirmities.",
        "These servile rules were drawn up into a kind of code; they offered to a\nRichelieu, a La Rochefoucauld and a Duras, in the exercise of their\ndomestic functions, opportunities of intimacy useful to their interests;\nand their vanity was flattered by customs which converted the right to\ngive a glass of water, to put on a dress, and to remove a basin, into\nhonourable prerogatives.",
        "Princes thus accustomed to be treated as divinities naturally ended by\nbelieving that they were of a distinct nature, of a purer essence than\nthe rest of mankind.",
        "This sort of etiquette, which led our Princes to be treated in private as\nidols, made them in public martyrs to decorum.  Marie Antoinette found in\nthe Chateau of Versailles a multitude of established customs which\nappeared to her insupportable.",
        "The ladies-in-waiting, who were all obliged to be sworn, and to wear full\nCourt dresses, were alone entitled to remain in the room, and to attend\nin conjunction with the dame d’honneur and the tirewoman.  The Queen\nabolished all this formality.  When her head was dressed, she curtsied to\nall the ladies who were in her chamber, and, followed only by her own\nwomen, went into her closet, where Mademoiselle Bertin, who could not be\nadmitted into the chamber, used to await her.  It was in this inner\ncloset that she produced her new and numerous dresses.  The Queen was\nalso desirous of being served by the most fashionable hairdresser in\nParis.  Now the custom which forbade all persons in inferior offices,\nemployed by royalty, to exert their talents for the public, was no doubt\nintended to cut off all communication between the privacy of princes and\nsociety at large; the latter being always extremely curious respecting\nthe most trifling particulars relative to the private life of the former.\nThe Queen, fearing that the taste of the hairdresser would suffer if he\nshould discontinue the general practice of his art, ordered him to attend\nas usual certain ladies of the Court and of Paris; and this multiplied\nthe opportunities of learning details respecting the household, and very\noften of misrepresenting them.",
        "One of the customs most disagreeable to the Queen was that of dining\nevery day in public.  Maria Leczinska had always submitted to this\nwearisome practice; Marie Antoinette followed it as long as she was\nDauphiness.  The Dauphin dined with her, and each branch of the family\nhad its public dinner daily.  The ushers suffered all decently dressed\npeople to enter; the sight was the delight of persons from the country.\nAt the dinner-hour there were none to be met upon the stairs but honest\nfolks, who, after having seen the Dauphiness take her soup, went to see\nthe Princes eat their ’bouilli’, and then ran themselves out of breath to\nbehold Mesdames at their dessert.",
        "Very ancient usage, too, required that the Queens of France should appear\nin public surrounded only by women; even at meal-times no persons of the\nother sex attended to serve at table; and although the King ate publicly\nwith the Queen, yet he himself was served by women with everything which\nwas presented to him directly at table.  The dame d’honneur, kneeling,\nfor her own accommodation, upon a low stool, with a napkin upon her arm,\nand four women in full dress, presented the plates to the King and Queen.\nThe dame d’honneur handed them drink.  This service had formerly been the\nright of the maids of honour.  The Queen, upon her accession to the\nthrone, abolished the usage altogether.  She also freed herself from the\nnecessity of being followed in the Palace of Versailles by two of her\nwomen in Court dresses, during those hours of the day when the ladies-in-\nwaiting were not with her.  From that time she was accompanied only by a\nsingle valet de chambre and two footmen.  All the changes made by Marie\nAntoinette were of the same description; a disposition gradually to\nsubstitute the simple customs of Vienna for those of Versailles was more\ninjurious to her than she could possibly have imagined.",
        "When the King slept in the Queen’s apartment he always rose before her;\nthe exact hour was communicated to the head femme de chambre, who\nentered, preceded by a servant of the bedchamber bearing a taper; she\ncrossed the room and unbolted the door which separated the Queen’s\napartment from that of the King.  She there found the first valet de\nchambre for the quarter, and a servant of the chamber.  They entered,\nopened the bed curtains on the King’s side, and presented him slippers\ngenerally, as well as the dressing-gown, which he put on, of gold or\nsilver stuff.  The first valet de chambre took down a short sword which\nwas always laid within the railing on the King’s side.  When the King\nslept with the Queen, this sword was brought upon the armchair\nappropriated to the King, and which was placed near the Queen’s bed,\nwithin the gilt railing which surrounded the bed.  The first femme de\nchambre conducted the King to the door, bolted it again, and, leaving the\nQueen’s chamber, did not return until the hour appointed by her Majesty\nthe evening before.  At night the Queen went to bed before the King; the\nfirst femme de chambre remained seated at the foot of her bed until the\narrival of his Majesty, in order, as in the morning, to see the King’s\nattendants out and bolt the door after them.  The Queen awoke habitually\nat eight o’clock, and breakfasted at nine, frequently in bed, and\nsometimes after she had risen, at a table placed opposite her couch.",
        "In order to describe the Queen’s private service intelligibly, it must be\nrecollected that service of every kind was honour, and had not any other\ndenomination.  To do the honours of the service was to present the\nservice to a person of superior rank, who happened to arrive at the\nmoment it was about to be performed.  Thus, supposing the Queen asked for\na glass of water, the servant of the chamber handed to the first woman a\nsilver gilt waiter, upon which were placed a covered goblet and a small\ndecanter; but should the lady of honour come in, the first woman was\nobliged to present the waiter to her, and if Madame or the Comtesse\nd’Artois came in at the moment, the waiter went again from the lady of\nhonour into the hands of the Princess before it reached the Queen.  It\nmust be observed, however, that if a princess of the blood instead of a\nprincess of the family entered, the service went directly from the first\nwoman to the princess of the blood, the lady of honour being excused from\ntransferring to any but princesses of the royal family.  Nothing was\npresented directly to the Queen; her handkerchief or her gloves were\nplaced upon a long salver of gold or silver gilt, which was placed as a\npiece of furniture of ceremony upon a side-table, and was called a\ngantiere.  The first woman presented to her in this manner all that she\nasked for, unless the tirewoman, the lady of honour, or a princess were\npresent, and then the gradation pointed out in the instance of the glass\nof water was always observed.",
        "Whether the Queen breakfasted in bed or up, those entitled to the petites\nentrees were equally admitted; this privilege belonged of right to her\nchief physician, chief surgeon, physician in ordinary, reader, closet\nsecretary, the King’s four first valets de chambre and their\nreversioners, and the King’s chief physicians and surgeons.  There were\nfrequently from ten to twelve persons at this first entree.  The lady of\nhonour or the superintendent, if present, placed the breakfast equipage\nupon the bed; the Princesse de Lamballe frequently performed that office.",
        "As soon as the Queen rose, the wardrobe woman was admitted to take away\nthe pillows and prepare the bed to be made by some of the valets de\nchambre.  She undrew the curtains, and the bed was not generally made\nuntil the Queen was gone to mass.  Generally, excepting at St.  Cloud,\nwhere the Queen bathed in an apartment below her own, a slipper bath was\nrolled into her room, and her bathers brought everything that was\nnecessary for the bath.  The Queen bathed in a large gown of English\nflannel buttoned down to the bottom;.  its sleeves throughout, as well as\nthe collar, were lined with linen.  When she came out of the bath the\nfirst woman held up a cloth to conceal her entirely from the sight of her\nwomen, and then threw it over her shoulders.  The bathers wrapped her in\nit and dried her completely.  She then put on a long and wide open\nchemise, entirely trimmed with lace, and afterwards a white taffety bed-\ngown.  The wardrobe woman warmed the bed; the slippers were of dimity,\ntrimmed with lace.  Thus dressed, the Queen went to bed again, and the\nbathers and servants of the chamber took away the bathing apparatus.  The\nQueen, replaced in bed, took a book or her tapestry work.  On her bathing\nmornings she breakfasted in the bath.  The tray was placed on the cover\nof the bath.  These minute details are given here only to do justice to\nthe Queen’s scrupulous modesty.  Her temperance was equally remarkable;\nshe breakfasted on coffee or chocolate; at dinner ate nothing but white\nmeat, drank water only, and supped on broth, a wing of a fowl, and small\nbiscuits, which she soaked in a glass of water.",
        "The tirewoman had under her order a principal under-tirewoman, charged\nwith the care and preservation of all the Queen’s dresses; two women to\nfold and press such articles as required it; two valets, and a porter of\nthe wardrobe.  The latter brought every morning into the Queen’s\napartments baskets covered with taffety, containing all that she was to\nwear during the day, and large cloths of green taffety covering the robes\nand the full dresses.  The valet of the wardrobe on duty presented every\nmorning a large book to the first femme de chambre, containing patterns\nof the gowns, full dresses, undresses, etc.  Every pattern was marked, to\nshow to which sort it belonged.  The first femme de chambre presented\nthis book to the Queen on her awaking, with a pincushion; her Majesty\nstuck pins in those articles which she chose for the day,–one for the\ndress, one for the afternoon-undress, and one for the full evening dress\nfor card or supper parties in the private apartments.  The book was then\ntaken back to the wardrobe, and all that was wanted for the day was soon\nafter brought in in large taffety wrappers.  The wardrobe woman, who had\nthe care of the linen, in her turn brought in a covered basket containing\ntwo or three chemises and handkerchiefs.  The morning basket was called\npret du jour.  In the evening she brought in one containing the nightgown\nand nightcap, and the stockings for the next morning; this basket was\ncalled pret de la nuit.  They were in the department of the lady of\nhonour, the tirewoman having nothing to do with the linen.  Nothing was\nput in order or taken care of by the Queen’s women.  As soon as the\ntoilet was over, the valets and porter belonging to the wardrobe were\ncalled in, and they carried all away in a heap, in the taffety wrappers,\nto the tirewoman’s wardrobe, where all were folded up again, hung up,\nexamined, and cleaned with so much regularity and care that even the\ncast-off clothes scarcely looked as if they had been worn.  The\ntirewoman’s wardrobe consisted of three large rooms surrounded with\nclosets, some furnished with drawers and others with shelves; there were\nalso large tables in each of these rooms, on which the gowns and dresses\nwere spread out and folded up.",
        "For the winter the Queen had generally twelve full dresses, twelve\nundresses called fancy dresses, and twelve rich hoop petticoats for the\ncard and supper parties in the smaller apartments.",
        "She had as many for the summer; those for the spring served likewise for\nthe autumn.  All these dresses were discarded at the end of each season,\nunless, indeed, she retained some that she particularly liked.  I am not\nspeaking of muslin or cambric gowns, or others of the same kind–they\nwere lately introduced; but such as these were not renewed at each\nreturning season, they were kept several years.  The chief women were\ncharged with the care and examination of the diamonds; this important\nduty was formerly confided to the tirewoman, but for many years had been\nincluded in the business of the first femmes de chambre.",
        "The public toilet took place at noon.  The toilet-table was drawn forward\ninto the middle of the room.  This piece of furniture was generally the\nrichest and most ornamented of all in the apartment of the Princesses.\nThe Queen used it in the same manner and place for undressing herself in\nthe evening.  She went to bed in corsets trimmed with ribbon, and sleeves\ntrimmed with lace, and wore a large neck handkerchief.  The Queen’s\ncombing cloth was presented by her first woman if she was alone at the\ncommencement of the toilet; or, as well as the other articles, by the\nladies of honour if they were come.  At noon the women who had been in\nattendance four and twenty hours were relieved by two women in full\ndress; the first woman went also to dress herself.  The grandee entrees\nwere admitted during the toilet; sofas were placed in circles for the\nsuperintendent, the ladies of honour, and tirewomen, and the governess of\nthe children of France when she came there; the duties of the ladies of\nthe bedchamber, having nothing to do with any kind of domestic or private\nfunctions, did not begin until the hour of going out to mass; they waited\nin the great closet, and entered when the toilet was over.  The Princes\nof the blood, captains of the Guards, and all great officers having the\nentry paid their court at the hour of the toilet.  The Queen saluted by\nnodding her head or bending her body, or leaning upon her toilet-table as\nif moving to rise; the last mode of salutation was for the Princes of the\nblood.  The King’s brothers also came very generally to pay their\nrespects to her Majesty while her hair was being dressed.  In the earlier\nyears of the reign the first part of the dressing was performed in the\nbedchamber and according to the laws of etiquette; that is to say, the\nlady of honour put on the chemise and poured out the water for the hands,\nthe tirewoman put on the skirt of the gown or full dress, adjusted the\nhandkerchief, and tied on the necklace.  But when the young Queen became\nmore seriously devoted to fashion, and the head-dress attained so\nextravagant a height that it became necessary to put on the chemise from\nbelow,–when, in short, she determined to have her milliner, Mademoiselle\nBenin, with her whilst she was dressing, whom the ladies would have\nrefused to admit to any share in the honour of attending on the Queen,\nthe dressing in the bedchamber was discontinued, and the Queen, leaving\nher toilet, withdrew into her closet to dress.",
        "On returning into her chamber, the Queen, standing about the middle of\nit, surrounded by the superintendent, the ladies of honour and tirewomen,\nher ladies of the palace, the chevalier d’honneur, the chief equerry, her\nclergy ready to attend her to mass, and the Princesses of the royal\nfamily who happened to come, accompanied by all their chief attendants\nand ladies, passed in order into the gallery as in going to mass.  The\nQueen’s signatures were generally given at the moment of entry into the\nchamber.  The secretary for orders presented the pen.  Presentations of\ncolonels on taking leave were usually made at this time.  Those of\nladies, and, such as had a right to the tabouret, or sitting in the royal\npresence, were made on Sunday evenings before card-playing began, on\ntheir coming in from paying their respects.  Ambassadors were introduced\nto the Queen on Tuesday mornings, accompanied by the introducer of\nambassadors on duty, and by M. de Sequeville, the secretary for the\nambassadors.  The introducer in waiting usually came to the Queen at her\ntoilet to apprise her of the presentations of foreigners which would be\nmade.  The usher of the chamber, stationed at the entrance, opened the\nfolding doors to none but the Princes and Princesses of the royal family,\nand announced them aloud.  Quitting his post, he came forward to name to\nthe lady of honour the persons who came to be presented, or who came to\ntake leave; that lady again named them to the Queen at the moment they\nsaluted her; if she and the tirewoman were absent, the first woman took\nthe place and did that duty.  The ladies of the bedchamber, chosen solely\nas companions for the Queen, had no domestic duties to fulfil, however\nopinion might dignify such offices.  The King’s letter in appointing\nthem, among other instructions of etiquette, ran thus: “having chosen you\nto bear the Queen company.”  There were hardly any emoluments accruing\nfrom this place.",
        "The Queen heard mass with the King in the tribune, facing the grand altar\nand the choir, with the exception of the days of high ceremony, when\ntheir chairs were placed below upon velvet carpets fringed with gold.\nThese days were marked by the name of grand chapel day.",
        "The Queen named the collector beforehand, and informed her of it through\nher lady of honour, who was besides desired to send the purse to her.\nThe collectors were almost always chosen from among those who had been\nrecently presented.  After returning from mass the Queen dined every\nSunday with the King only, in public in the cabinet of the nobility, a\nroom leading to her chamber.  Titled ladies having the honours sat during\nthe dinner upon folding-chairs placed on each side of the table.  Ladies\nwithout titles stood round the table; the captain of the Guards and the\nfirst gentleman of the chamber were behind the King’s chair; behind that\nof the Queen were her first maitre d’hotel, her chevalier d’honneur, and\nthe chief equerry.  The Queen’s maitre d’hotel was furnished with a large\nstaff, six or seven feet in length, ornamented with golden fleurs-de-lis,\nand surmounted by fleurs-de-lis in the form of a crown.  He entered the\nroom with this badge of his office to announce that the Queen was served.\nThe comptroller put into his hands the card of the dinner; in the absence\nof the maitre d’hotel he presented it to the Queen himself, otherwise he\nonly did him the honours of the service.  The maitre d’hotel did not\nleave his place, he merely gave the orders for serving up and removing;\nthe comptroller and gentlemen serving placed the various dishes upon the\ntable, receiving them from the inferior servants.",
        "The Prince nearest to the crown presented water to wash the King’s hands\nat the moment he placed himself at table, and a princess did the same\nservice to the Queen.",
        "The table service was formerly performed for the Queen by the lady of\nhonour and four women in full dress; this part of the women’s service was\ntransferred to them on the suppression of the office of maids of honour.\nThe Queen put an end to this etiquette in the first year of her reign.\nWhen the dinner was over the Queen returned without the King to her\napartment with her women, and took off her hoop and train.",
        "This unfortunate Princess, against whom the opinions of the French people\nwere at length so much excited, possessed qualities which deserved to\nobtain the greatest popularity.  None could doubt this who, like myself,\nhad heard her with delight describe the patriarchal manners of the House\nof Lorraine.  She was accustomed to say that, by transplanting their\nmanners into Austria, the Princes of that house had laid the foundation\nof the unassailable popularity enjoyed by the imperial family.  She\nfrequently related to me the interesting manner in which the Ducs de\nLorraine levied the taxes.  “The sovereign Prince,” said she, “went to\nchurch; after the sermon he rose, waved his hat in the air, to show that\nhe was about to speak, and then mentioned the sum whereof he stood in\nneed.  Such was the zeal of the good Lorrainers that men have been known\nto take away linen or household utensils without the knowledge of their\nwives, and sell them to add the value to their contribution.  It\nsometimes happened, too, that the Prince received more money than he had\nasked for, in which case he restored the surplus.”",
        "All who were acquainted with the Queen’s private qualities knew that she\nequally deserved attachment and esteem.  Kind and patient to excess in\nher relations with her household, she indulgently considered all around\nher, and interested herself in their fortunes and in their pleasures.,\nShe had, among her women, young girls from the Maison de St. Cyr, all\nwell born; the Queen forbade them the play when the performances were not\nsuitable; sometimes, when old plays were to be represented, if she found\nshe could not with certainty trust to her memory, she would take the\ntrouble to read them in the morning, to enable her to decide whether the\ngirls should or should not go to see them,–rightly considering herself\nbound to watch over their morals and conduct.",
        "During the first few months of his reign Louis XVI. dwelt at La Muette,\nMarly, and Compiegne.  When settled at Versailles he occupied himself\nwith a general examination of his grandfather’s papers.  He had promised\nthe Queen to communicate to her all that he might discover relative to\nthe history of the man with the iron mask, who, he thought, had become so\ninexhaustible a source of conjecture only in consequence of the interest\nwhich the pen of a celebrated writer had excited respecting the detention\nof a prisoner of State, who was merely a man of whimsical tastes and\nhabits.",
        "I was with the Queen when the King, having finished his researches,\ninformed her that he had not found anything among the secret papers\nelucidating the existence of this prisoner; that he had conversed on the\nmatter with M. de Maurepas, whose age made him contemporary with the\nepoch during which the story must have been known to the ministers;\nand that M. de Maurepas had assured him he was merely a prisoner of a\nvery dangerous character, in consequence of his disposition for intrigue.\nHe was a subject of the Duke of Mantua, and was enticed to the frontier,\narrested there, and kept prisoner, first at Pignerol, and afterwards in\nthe Bastille.  This transfer took place in consequence of the appointment\nof the governor of the former place to the government of the latter.\nIt was for fear the prisoner should profit by the inexperience of a new\ngovernor that he was sent with the Governor of Pignerol to the Bastille.",
        "Such was, in fact, the truth about the man on whom people have been\npleased to fix an iron mask.  And thus was it related in writing, and\npublished by M. ––- twenty years ago.  He had searched the archives of\nthe Foreign Office, and laid the real story before the public; but the\npublic, prepossessed in favour of a marvellous version, would not\nacknowledge the authenticity of his account.  Every man relied upon the\nauthority of Voltaire; and it was believed that a natural or a twin\nbrother of Louis XIV. lived many years in prison with a mask over his\nface.  The story of this mask, perhaps, had its origin in the old custom,\namong both men and women in Italy, of wearing a velvet mask when they\nexposed themselves to the sun.  It is possible that the Italian captive\nmay have sometimes shown himself upon the terrace of his prison with his\nface thus covered.  As to the silver plate which this celebrated prisoner\nis said to have thrown from his window, it is known that such a\ncircumstance did happen, but it happened at Valzin, in the time of\nCardinal Richelieu.  This anecdote has been mixed up with the inventions\nrespecting the Piedmontese prisoner.",
        "In this survey of the papers of Louis XV. by his grandson some very\ncurious particulars relative to his private treasury were found.  Shares\nin various financial companies afforded him a revenue, and had in course\nof time produced him a capital of some amount, which he applied to his\nsecret expenses.  The King collected his vouchers of title to these\nshares, and made a present of them to M. Thierry de Ville d’Avray, his\nchief valet de chambre.",
        "The Queen was desirous to secure the comfort of Mesdames, the daughters\nof Louis XV., who were held in the highest respect.  About this period\nshe contributed to furnish them with a revenue sufficient to provide them\nan easy, pleasant existence: The King gave them the Chateau of Bellevue;\nand added to the produce of it, which was given up to them, the expenses\nof their table and equipage, and payment of all the charges of their\nhousehold, the number of which was even increased.  During the lifetime\nof Louis XV., who was a very selfish prince, his daughters, although they\nhad attained forty years of age, had no other place of residence than\ntheir apartments in the Chateau of Versailles; no other walks than such\nas they could take in the large park of that palace; and no other means\nof gratifying their taste for the cultivation of plants but by having\nboxes and vases, filled with them, in their balconies or their closets.\nThey had, therefore, reason to be much pleased with the conduct of Marie\nAntoinette, who had the greatest influence in the King’s kindness towards\nhis aunts.",
        "Paris did not cease, during the first years of the reign, to give proofs\nof pleasure whenever the Queen appeared at any of the plays of the\ncapital.  At the representation of “Iphigenia in Aulis,” the actor who\nsang the words, “Let us sing, let us celebrate our Queen!”  which were\nrepeated by the chorus, directed by a respectful movement the eyes of the\nwhole assembly upon her Majesty.  Reiterated cries of ’Bis’! and clapping\nof hands, were followed by such a burst of enthusiasm that many of the\naudience added their voices to those of the actors in order to celebrate,\nit might too truly be said, another Iphigenia.  The Queen, deeply\naffected, covered her eyes with her handkerchief; and this proof of\nsensibility raised the public enthusiasm to a still higher pitch.",
        "The King gave Marie Antoinette Petit Trianon.",
        "     [The Chateau of Petit Trianon, which was built for Louis XV., was\n     not remarkably handsome as a building.  The luxuriance of the\n     hothouses rendered the place agreeable to that Prince.  He spent a\n     few days there several times in the year.  It was when he was\n     setting off from Versailles for Petit Trianon that he was struck in\n     the side by the knife of Damiens, and it was there that he was\n     attacked by the smallpox, of which he died on the 10th of May,\n     1774.–MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "Henceforward she amused herself with improving the gardens, without\nallowing any addition to the building, or any change in the furniture,\nwhich was very shabby, and remained, in 1789, in the same state as during\nthe reign of Louis XV.  Everything there, without exception, was\npreserved; and the Queen slept in a faded bed, which had been used by the\nComtesse du Barry.  The charge of extravagance, generally made against\nthe Queen, is the most unaccountable of all the popular errors respecting\nher character.  She had exactly the contrary failing; and I could prove\nthat she often carried her economy to a degree of parsimony actually\nblamable, especially in a sovereign.  She took a great liking for\nTrianon, and used to go there alone, followed by a valet; but she found\nattendants ready to receive her,–a concierge and his wife, who served\nher as femme de chambre, women of the wardrobe, footmen, etc.",
        "When she first took possession of Petit Trianon, it was reported that she\nchanged the name of the seat which the King had given her, and called it\nLittle Vienna, or Little Schoenbrunn.  A person who belonged to the\nCourt, and was silly enough to give this report credit, wishing to visit\nPetit Trianon with a party, wrote to M. Campan, requesting the Queen’s\npermission to do so.  In his note he called Trianon Little Vienna.\nSimilar requests were usually laid before the Queen just as they were\nmade: she chose to give the permissions to see her gardens herself,\nliking to grant these little favours.  When she came to the words I have\nquoted she was very, much offended, and exclaimed, angrily, that there\nwere too many, fools ready, to aid the malicious; that she had been told\nof the report circulated, which pretended that she had thought of nothing\nbut her own country, and that she kept an Austrian heart, while the\ninterests of France alone ought to engage her.  She refused the request\nso awkwardly made, and desired M. Campan to reply, that Trianon was not\nto be seen for some time, and that the Queen was astonished that any man\nin good society should believe she would do so ill-judged a thing as to\nchange the French names of her palaces to foreign ones.",
        "Before the Emperor Joseph II’s first visit to France the Queen received a\nvisit from the Archduke Maximilian in 1775.  A stupid act of the\nambassador, seconded on the part of the Queen by the Abbe de Vermond,\ngave rise at that period to a discussion which offended the Princes of\nthe blood and the chief nobility of the kingdom.  Travelling incognito,\nthe young Prince claimed that the first visit was not due from him to the\nPrinces of the blood; and the Queen supported his pretension.",
        "From the time of the Regency, and on account of the residence of the\nfamily of Orleans in the bosom of the capital, Paris had preserved a\nremarkable degree of attachment and respect for that branch of the royal\nhouse; and although the crown was becoming more and more remote from the\nPrinces of the House of Orleans, they had the advantage (a great one with\nthe Parisians) of being the descendants of Henri IV.  An affront to that\npopular family was a serious ground of dislike to the Queen.  It was at\nthis period that the circles of the city, and even of the Court,\nexpressed themselves bitterly about her levity, and her partiality for\nthe House of Austria.  The Prince for whom the Queen had embarked in an\nimportant family quarrel–and a quarrel involving national prerogatives–\nwas, besides, little calculated to inspire interest.  Still young,\nuninformed, and deficient in natural talent, he was always making\nblunders.",
        "He went to the Jardin du Roi; M. de Buffon, who received him there,\noffered him a copy of his works; the Prince declined accepting the book,\nsaying to M. de Buffon, in the most polite manner possible, “I should be\nvery sorry to deprive you of it.”",
        "     [Joseph II, on his visit to France, also went to see M. de Buffon,\n     and said to that celebrated man, “I am come to fetch the copy of\n     your works which my brother forgot.\"–NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]",
        "It may be supposed that the Parisians were much entertained with this\nanswer.",
        "The Queen was exceedingly mortified at the mistakes made by her brother;\nbut what hurt her most was being accused of preserving an Austrian heart.\nMarie Antoinette had more than once to endure that imputation during the\nlong course of her misfortunes.  Habit did not stop the tears such\ninjustice caused; but the first time she was suspected of not loving\nFrance, she gave way to her indignation.  All that she could say on the\nsubject was useless; by seconding the pretensions of the Archduke she had\nput arms into her enemies’ hands; they were labouring to deprive her of\nthe love of the people, and endeavoured, by all possible means, to spread\na belief that the Queen sighed for Germany, and preferred that country to\nFrance.",
        "Marie Antoinette had none but herself to rely on for preserving the\nfickle smiles of the Court and the public.  The King, too indifferent to\nserve her as a guide, as yet had conceived no love for her,\nnotwithstanding the intimacy that grew between them at Choisy.  In his\ncloset Louis XVI. was immersed in deep study.  At the Council he was\nbusied with the welfare of his people; hunting and mechanical occupations\nengrossed his leisure moments, and he never thought on the subject of an\nheir.",
        "The coronation took place at Rheims, with all the accustomed pomp.  At\nthis period the people’s love for Louis XVI.  burst forth in transports\nnot to be mistaken for party demonstrations or idle curiosity.  He\nreplied to this enthusiasm by marks of confidence, worthy of a people\nhappy in being governed by a good King; he took a pleasure in repeatedly\nwalking without guards, in the midst of the crowd which pressed around\nhim, and called down blessings on his head.  I remarked the impression\nmade at this time by an observation of Louis XVI.  On the day of his\ncoronation he put his hand up to his head, at the moment of the crown\nbeing placed upon it, and said, “It pinches me.”  Henri III. had\nexclaimed, “It pricks me.”  Those who were near the King were struck with\nthe similarity between these two exclamations, though not of a class\nlikely to be blinded by the superstitious fears of ignorance.",
        "While the Queen, neglected as she was, could not even hope for the\nhappiness of being a mother, she had the mortification of seeing the\nComtesse d’Artois give birth to the Duc d’Angouleme.",
        "Custom required that the royal family and the whole Court should be\npresent at the accouchement of the Princesses; the Queen was therefore\nobliged to stay a whole day in her sister-in-law’s chamber.  The moment\nthe Comtesse d’Artois was informed a prince was born, she put her hand to\nher forehead and exclaimed with energy, “My God, how happy I am!”  The\nQueen felt very differently at this involuntary and natural exclamation.\nNevertheless, her behaviour was perfect.  She bestowed all possible marks\nof tenderness upon the young mother, and would not leave her until she\nwas again put into bed; she afterwards passed along the staircase, and\nthrough the hall of the guards, with a calm demeanour, in the midst of an\nimmense crowd.  The poissardes, who had assumed a right of speaking to\nsovereigns in their own vulgar language, followed her to the very doors\nof her apartments, calling out to her with gross expressions, that she\nought to produce heirs.  The Queen reached her inner room, hurried and\nagitated; he shut herself up to weep with me alone, not from jealousy of\nher sister-in-law’s happiness,–of that he was incapable,–but from\nsorrow at her own situation.",
        "Deprived of the happiness of giving an heir to the crown, the Queen\nendeavoured to interest herself in the children of the people of her\nhousehold.  She had long been desirous to bring up one of them herself,\nand to make it the constant object of her care.  A little village boy,\nfour or five years old, full of health, with a pleasing countenance,\nremarkably large blue eyes, and fine light hair, got under the feet of\nthe Queen’s horses, when she was taking an airing in a calash, through\nthe hamlet of St. Michel, near Louveciennes.  The coachman and postilions\nstopped the horses, and the child was rescued without the slightest\ninjury.  Its grandmother rushed out of the door of her cottage to take\nit; but the Queen, standing up in her calash and extending her arms,\ncalled out that the child was hers, and that destiny had given it to her,\nto console her, no doubt, until she should have the happiness of having\none herself.  “Is his mother alive?” asked the Queen.  “No, Madame; my\ndaughter died last winter, and left five small children upon my hands.\"\n\"I will take this one, and provide for all the rest; do you consent?\"\n\"Ah, Madame, they are too fortunate,” replied the cottager; “but Jacques\nis a bad boy.  I hope he will stay with you!”  The Queen, taking little\nJacques upon her knee, said that she would make him used to her, and gave\norders to proceed.  It was necessary, however, to shorten the drive, so\nviolently did Jacques scream, and kick the Queen and her ladies.",
        "The arrival of her Majesty at her apartments at Versailles, holding the\nlittle rustic by the hand, astonished the whole household; he cried out\nwith intolerable shrillness that he wanted his grandmother, his brother\nLouis, and his sister Marianne; nothing could calm him.  He was taken\naway by the wife of a servant, who was appointed to attend him as nurse.\nThe other children were put to school.  Little Jacques, whose family name\nwas Armand, came back to the Queen two days afterwards; a white frock\ntrimmed with lace, a rose-coloured sash with silver fringe, and a hat\ndecorated with feathers, were now substituted for the woollen cap, the\nlittle red frock, and the wooden shoes.  The child was really very\nbeautiful.  The Queen was enchanted with him; he was brought to her every\nmorning at nine o’clock; he breakfasted and dined with her, and often\neven with the King.  She liked to call him my child,",
        "     [This little unfortunate was nearly twenty in 1792; the fury of the\n     people and the fear of being thought a favourite of the Queen’s had\n     made him the most sanguinary terrorist of Versailles.  He was killed\n     at the battle of Jemappes.]",
        "and lavished caresses upon him, still maintaining a deep silence\nrespecting the regrets which constantly occupied her heart.",
        "This child remained with the Queen until the time when Madame was old\nenough to come home to her august mother, who had particularly taken upon\nherself the care of her education.",
        "The Queen talked incessantly of the qualities which she admired in Louis\nXVI., and gladly attributed to herself the slightest favourable change in\nhis manner; perhaps she displayed too unreservedly the joy she felt, and\nthe share she appropriated in the improvement.  One day Louis XVI.\nsaluted her ladies with more kindness than usual, and the Queen\nlaughingly said to them, “Now confess, ladies, that for one so badly\ntaught as a child, the King has saluted you with very good grace!”",
        "The Queen hated M. de La Vauguyon; she accused him alone of those points\nin the habits, and even the sentiments, of the King which hurt her.\nA former first woman of the bedchamber to Queen Maria Leczinska had\ncontinued in office near the young Queen.  She was one of those people\nwho are fortunate enough to spend their lives in the service of kings\nwithout knowing anything of what is passing at Court.  She was a great\ndevotee; the Abbe Grisel, an ex-Jesuit, was her director.  Being rich\nfrom her savings and an income of 50,000 livres, she kept a very good\ntable; in her apartment, at the Grand Commun, the most distinguished\npersons who still adhered to the Order of Jesuits often assembled.  The\nDuc de La Vauguyon was intimate with her; their chairs at the Eglise des\nReollets were placed near each other; at high mass and at vespers they\nsang the “Gloria in Excelsis” and the “Magnificat” together; and the\npious virgin, seeing in him only one of God’s elect, little imagined him\nto be the declared enemy of a Princess whom she served and revered.\nOn the day of his death she ran in tears to relate to the Queen the\npiety, humility, and repentance of the last moments of the Duc de La\nVauguyon.  He had called his people together, she said, to ask their\npardon.  “For what?”  replied the Queen, sharply; “he has placed and\npensioned off all his servants; it was of the King and his brothers that\nthe holy man you bewail should have asked pardon, for having paid so\nlittle attention to the education of princes on whom the fate and\nhappiness of twenty-five millions of men depend.  Luckily,” added she,\n\"the King and his brothers, still young, have incessantly laboured to\nrepair the errors of their preceptor.”",
        "The progress of time, and the confidence with which the King and the\nPrinces, his brothers, were inspired by the change in their situation\nsince the death of Louis XV., had developed their characters.  I will\nendeavour to depict them.",
        "The features of Louis XVI.  were noble enough, though somewhat melancholy\nin expression; his walk was heavy and unmajestic; his person greatly\nneglected; his hair, whatever might be the skill of his hairdresser,\nwas soon in disorder.  His voice, without being harsh, was not agreeable;\nif he grew animated in speaking he often got above his natural pitch,\nand became shrill.  The Abbe de Radonvilliers, his preceptor, one of the\nForty of the French Academy, a learned and amiable man, had given him and\nMonsieur a taste for study.  The King had continued to instruct himself;\nhe knew the English language perfectly; I have often heard him translate\nsome of the most difficult passages in Milton’s poems.  He was a skilful\ngeographer, and was fond of drawing and colouring maps; he was well\nversed in history, but had not perhaps sufficiently studied the spirit of\nit.  He appreciated dramatic beauties, and judged them accurately.  At\nChoisy, one day, several ladies expressed their dissatisfaction because\nthe French actors were going to perform one of Moliere’s pieces.  The\nKing inquired why they disapproved of the choice.  One of them answered\nthat everybody must admit that Moliere had very bad taste; the King\nreplied that many things might be found in Moliere contrary to fashion,\nbut that it appeared to him difficult to point out any in bad taste?",
        "     [The King, having purchased the Chateau of Rambouillet from the Duc\n     de Penthievre, amused himself with embellishing it.  I have seen a\n     register entirely in his own handwriting, which proves that he\n     possessed a great variety of information on the minutiae of various\n     branches of knowledge.  In his accounts he would not omit an outlay\n     of a franc.  His figures and letters, when he wished to write\n     legibly, were small and very neat, but in general he wrote very ill.\n     He was so sparing of paper that he divided a sheet into eight, six,\n     or four pieces, according to the length of what he had to write.\n     Towards the close of the page he compressed the letters, and avoided\n     interlineations.  The last words were close to the edge of the\n     paper; he seemed to regret being obliged to begin another page.  He\n     was methodical and analytical; he divided what he wrote into\n     chapters and sections.  He had extracted from the works of Nicole\n     and Fenelon, his favourite authors, three or four hundred concise\n     and sententious phrases; these he had classed according to subject,\n     and formed a work of them in the style of Montesquieu.  To this\n     treatise he had given the following general title: “Of Moderate\n     Monarchy” (De la Monarchie temperee), with chapters entitled, “Of\n     the Person of the Prince;”  “Of the Authority of Bodies in the\n     State;”  “Of the Character of the Executive Functions of the\n     Monarchy.”  Had he been able to carry into effect all the grand\n     precepts he had observed in Fenelon, Louis XVI. would have been an\n     accomplished monarch, and France a powerful kingdom.  The King used\n     to accept the speeches his ministers presented to him to deliver on\n     important occasions; but he corrected and modified them; struck out\n     some parts, and added others; and sometimes consulted the Queen on\n     the subject.  The phrase of the minister erased by the King was\n     frequently unsuitable, and dictated by the minister’s private\n     feelings; but the King’s was always the natural expression.  He\n     himself composed, three times or oftener, his famous answers to the\n     Parliament which he banished.  But in his letters he was negligent,\n     and always incorrect.  Simplicity was the characteristic of the\n     King’s style; the figurative style of M. Necker did not please him;\n     the sarcasms of Maurepas were disagreeable to him.  Unfortunate\n     Prince! he would predict, in his observations, that if such a\n     calamity should happen, the monarchy would be ruined; and the next\n     day he would consent in Council to the very measure which he had\n     condemned the day before, and which brought him nearer the brink of\n     the precipice.–SOULAVIE, “Historical and Political Memoirs of the\n     Reign of Louis XVI.,” vol.  ii.]",
        "This Prince combined with his attainments the attributes of a good\nhusband, a tender father, and an indulgent master.",
        "Unfortunately he showed too much predilection for the mechanical arts;\nmasonry and lock-making so delighted him that he admitted into his\nprivate apartment a common locksmith, with whom he made keys and locks;\nand his hands, blackened by that sort of work, were often, in my\npresence, the subject of remonstrances and even sharp reproaches from\nthe Queen, who would have chosen other amusements for her husband.?",
        "     [Louis XVI. saw that the art of lock-making was capable of\n     application to a higher study, He was an excellent geographer.  The\n     most valuable and complete instrument for the study of that science\n     was begun by his orders and under his direction.  It was an immense\n     globe of copper, which was long preserved, though unfinished, in the\n     Mazarine library.  Louis XVI.  invented and had executed under his\n     own eyes the ingenious mechanism required for this globe.–NOTE BY\n     THE EDITOR.]",
        "Austere and rigid with regard to himself alone, the King observed the\nlaws of the Church with scrupulous exactness.  He fasted and abstained\nthroughout the whole of Lent.  He thought it right that the queen should\nnot observe these customs with the same strictness.  Though sincerely\npious, the spirit of the age had disposed his mind to toleration.\nTurgot, Malesherbes, and Necker judged that this Prince, modest and\nsimple in his habits, would willingly sacrifice the royal prerogative to\nthe solid greatness of his people.  His heart, in truth, disposed him\ntowards reforms; but his prejudices and fears, and the clamours of pious\nand privileged persons, intimidated him, and made him abandon plans which\nhis love for the people had suggested.",
        "Monsieur–",
        "     [During his stay at Avignon, Monsieur, afterwards Louis XVIII,\n     lodged with the Duc de Crillon; he refused the town-guard which was\n     offered him, saying, “A son of France, under the roof of a Crillon,\n     needs no guard.\"–NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]",
        "had more dignity of demeanour than the King; but his corpulence rendered\nhis gait inelegant.  He was fond of pageantry and magnificence.  He\ncultivated the belles lettres, and under assumed names often contributed\nverses to the Mercury and other papers.",
        "His wonderful memory was the handmaid of his wit, furnishing him with the\nhappiest quotations.  He knew by heart a varied repertoire, from the\nfinest passages of the Latin classics to the Latin of all the prayers,\nfrom the works of Racine to the vaudeville of “Rose et Colas.”",
        "The Comte d’Artoisi had an agreeable countenance, was well made, skilful\nin bodily exercises, lively, impetuous, fond of pleasure, and very\nparticular in his dress.  Some happy observations made by him were\nrepeated with approval, and gave a favourable idea of his heart.  The\nParisians liked the open and frank character of this Prince, which they\nconsidered national, and showed real affection for him.",
        "The dominion that the Queen gained over the King’s mind, the charms of a\nsociety in which Monsieur displayed his wit, and to which the Comte\nd’Artois–[Afterwards Charles X.]– gave life by the vivacity of youth,\ngradually softened that ruggedness of manner in Louis XVI. which a\nbetter-conducted education might have prevented.  Still, this defect\noften showed itself, and, in spite of his extreme simplicity, the King\ninspired those who had occasion to speak to him with diffidence.\nCourtiers, submissive in the presence of their sovereign, are only the\nmore ready to caricature him; with little good breeding, they called\nthose answers they so much dreaded, Les coups de boutoir du Roi.–[The\nliteral meaning of the phrase “coup de boutoir,” is a thrust from the\nsnout of a boar.]",
        "Methodical in all his habits, the King always went to bed at eleven\nprecisely.  One evening the Queen was going with her usual circle to a\nparty, either at the Duc de Duras’s or the Princesse de Glumenee’s.\nThe hand of the clock was slily put forward to hasten the King’s\ndeparture by a few minutes; he thought bed-time was come, retired, and\nfound none of his attendants ready to wait on him.  This joke became\nknown in all the drawing-rooms of Versailles, and was disapproved of\nthere.  Kings have no privacy.  Queens have no boudoirs.  If those who\nare in immediate attendance upon sovereigns be not themselves disposed to\ntransmit their private habits to posterity, the meanest valet will relate\nwhat he has seen or heard; his gossip circulates rapidly, and forms\npublic opinion, which at length ascribes to the most august persons\ncharacters which, however untrue they may be, are almost always\nindelible.",
        "NOTE.  The only passion ever shown by Louis XVI. was for hunting.  He was\nso much occupied by it that when I went up into his private closets at\nVersailles, after the 10th of August, I saw upon the staircase six\nframes, in which were seen statements of all his hunts, when Dauphin and\nwhen King.  In them was detailed the number, kind, and quality of\nthe game he had killed at each hunting party during every month, every\nseason, and every year of his reign.",
        "The interior of his private apartments was thus arranged: a salon,\nornamented with gilded mouldings, displayed the engravings which had been\ndedicated to him, drawings of the canals he had dug, with the model of\nthat of Burgundy, and the plan of the cones and works of Cherbourg.  The\nupper hall contained his collection of geographical charts, spheres,\nglobes, and also his geographical cabinet.  There were to be seen\ndrawings of maps which he had begun, and some that he had finished.  He\nhad a clever method of washing them in.  His geographical memory was\nprodigious.  Over the hall was the turning and joining room, furnished\nwith ingenious instruments for working in wood.  He inherited some from\nLouis XV., and he often busied himself, with Duret’s assistance, in\nkeeping them clean and bright.  Above was the library of books published\nduring his reign.  The prayer books and manuscript books of Anne of\nBrittany, Francois I, the later Valois, Louis XIV., Louis XV., and the\nDauphin formed the great hereditary library of the Chateau.  Louis XVI.\nplaced separately, in two apartments communicating with each other, the\nworks of his own time, including a complete collection of Didot’s\neditions, in vellum, every volume enclosed in a morocco case.  There were\nseveral English works, among the rest the debates of the British\nParliament, in a great number of volumes in folio (this is the Moniteur\nof England, a complete collection of which is so valuable and so scarce).\nBy the side of this collection was to be seen a manuscript history of all\nthe schemes for a descent upon that island, particularly that of Comte de\nBroglie.  One of the presses of this cabinet was full of cardboard boxes,\ncontaining papers relative to the House of Austria, inscribed in the\nKing’s own hand: “Secret papers of my family respecting the House of\nAustria; papers of my family respecting the Houses of Stuart and\nHanover.”  In an adjoining press were kept papers relative to Russia.\nSatirical works against Catherine II.  and against Paul I.  were sold in\nFrance under the name of histories; Louis XVIII. collected and sealed up\nwith his small seal the scandalous anecdotes against Catherine II., as\nwell as the works of Rhulieres, of which he had a copy, to be certain\nthat the secret life of that Princess, which attracted the curiosity of\nher contemporaries, should not be made public by his means.",
        "Above the King’s private library were a forge, two anvils, and a vast\nnumber of iron tools; various common locks, well made and perfect; some\nsecret locks, and locks ornamented with gilt copper.  It was there that\nthe infamous Gamin, who afterwards accused the King of having tried to\npoison him, and was rewarded for his calumny with a pension of twelve\nthousand livres, taught him the art of lock-making.  This Gamin, who\nbecame our guide, by order of the department and municipality of\nVersailles, did not, however, denounce the King on the 20th December,\n1792.  He had been made the confidant of that Prince in an immense number\nof important commissions; the King had sent him the “Red Book,” from\nParis, in a parcel; and the part which was concealed during the\nConstituent Assembly still remained so in 1793.  Gamin hid it in a part\nof the Chateau inaccessible to everybody, and took it from under the\nshelves of a secret press before our eyes.  This is a convincing proof\nthat Louis XVI. hoped to return to his Chiteau.  When teaching Louis XVI.\nhis trade Gamin took upon himself the tone and authority of a master.\n\"The King was good, forbearing, timid, inquisitive, and addicted to\nsleep,” said Gamin to me; “he was fond to excess of lock-making, and he\nconcealed himself from the Queen and the Court to file and forge with me.\nIn order to convey his anvil and my own backwards and forwards we were\nobliged to use a thousand stratagems, the history of which would: never\nend.”  Above the King’s and Gamin’s forges and anvils was an,\nobservatory, erected upon a platform covered with lead.  There, seated on\nan armchair, and assisted by a telescope, the King observed all that was\npassing in the courtyards of Versailles, the avenue of Paris, and the\nneighbouring gardens.  He had taken a liking to Duret, one of the indoor\nservants of the palace, who sharpened his tools, cleaned his anvils,\npasted his maps, and adjusted eyeglasses to the King’s sight, who was\nshort-sighted.  This good Duret, and indeed all the indoor servants,\nspoke of their master with regret and affection, and with tears in their\neyes.",
        "The King was born weak and delicate; but from the age of twenty-four he\npossessed a robust constitution, inherited from his mother, who was of\nthe House of Saxe, celebrated for generations for its robustness.  There\nwere two men in Louis XVI., the man of knowledge and the man of will.\nThe King knew the history of his own family and of the first houses of\nFrance perfectly.  He composed the instructions for M. de la Peyrouse’s\nvoyage round the world, which the minister thought were drawn up by\nseveral members of the Academy of Sciences.  His memory retained an\ninfinite number of names and situations.  He remembered quantities and\nnumbers wonderfully.  One day an account was presented to him in which\nthe minister had ranked among the expenses an item inserted in the\naccount of the preceding year.  “There is a double charge,” said the\nKing; “bring me last year’s account, and I will show it yet there.”  When\nthe King was perfectly master of the details of any matter, and saw\ninjustice, he was obdurate even to harshness.  Then he would be obeyed\ninstantly, in order to be sure that he was obeyed.",
        "But in important affairs of state the man of will was not to be found.\nLouis XVI. was upon the throne exactly what those weak temperaments whom\nnature has rendered incapable of an opinion are in society.  In his\npusillanimity, he gave his confidence to a minister; and although amidst\nvarious counsels he often knew which was the best, he never had the\nresolution to say, “I prefer the opinion of such a one.”  Herein\noriginated the misfortunes of the State.–SOULAVIE’S “Historical and\nPolitical Memoirs Of the Reign Of LOUIS XVI.,” VOL ii.",
        "The winter following the confinement of the Comtesse d’Artois was very\nsevere; the recollections of the pleasure which sleighing-parties had\ngiven the Queen in her childhood made her wish to introduce similar ones\nin France.  This amusement had already been known in that Court, as was\nproved by sleighs being found in the stables which had been used by the\nDauphin, the father of Louis XVI.  Some were constructed for the Queen in\na more modern style.  The Princes also ordered several; and in a few days\nthere was a tolerable number of these vehicles.  They were driven by the\nprinces and noblemen of the Court.  The noise of the bells and balls with\nwhich the harness of the horses was furnished, the elegance and whiteness\nof their plumes, the varied forms of the carriages, the gold with which\nthey were all ornamented, rendered these parties delightful to the eye.\nThe winter was very favourable to them, the snow remaining on the ground\nnearly six weeks; the drives in the park afforded a pleasure shared by\nthe spectators.",
        "     [Louis XVI., touched with the wretched condition of the poor of\n     Versailles during the winter of 1776, had several cart-loads of wood\n     distributed among them.  Seeing one day a file of those vehicles\n     passing by, while several noblemen were preparing to be drawn\n     swiftly over the ice, he uttered these memorable words: “Gentlemen,\n     here are my sleighs!\"–NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]",
        "No one imagined that any blame could attach to so innocent an amusement.\nBut the party were tempted to extend their drives as far as the Champs\nElysees; a few sleighs even crossed the boulevards; the ladies being\nmasked, the Queen’s enemies took the opportunity of saying that she had\ntraversed the streets of Paris in a sleigh.",
        "This became a matter of moment.  The public discovered in it a\npredilection for the habits of Vienna; but all that Marie Antoinette did\nwas criticised.",
        "Sleigh-driving, savouring of the Northern Courts, had no favour among the\nParisians.  The Queen was informed of this; and although all the sleighs\nwere preserved, and several subsequent winters lent themselves to the\namusement, she would not resume it.",
        "It was at the time of the sleighing-parties that the Queen became\nintimately acquainted with the Princesse de Lamballe, who made her\nappearance in them wrapped in fur, with all the brilliancy and freshness\nof the age of twenty,–the emblem of spring, peeping from under sable and\nermine.  Her situation, moreover, rendered her peculiarly interesting;\nmarried, when she was scarcely past childhood, to a young prince, who\nruined himself by the contagious example of the Duc d’Orleans, she had\nhad nothing to do from the time of her arrival in France but to weep.\nA widow at eighteen, and childless, she lived with the Duc de Penthievre\nas an adopted daughter.  She had the tenderest respect and attachment for\nthat venerable Prince; but the Queen, though doing justice to his\nvirtues, saw that the Duc de Penthievre’s way of life, whether at Paris\nor at his country-seat, could neither afford his young daughter-in-law\nthe amusements suited to her time of life, nor ensure her in the future\nan establishment such as she was deprived of by her widowhood.  She\ndetermined, therefore, to establish her at Versailles; and for her sake\nrevived the office of superintendent, which had been discontinued at\nCourt since the death of Mademoiselle de Clermont.  It is said that Maria\nLeczinska had decided that this place should continue vacant, the\nsuperintendent having so extensive a power in the houses of queens as to\nbe frequently a restraint upon their inclinations.  Differences which\nsoon took place between Marie Antoinette and the Princesse de Lamballe\nrespecting the official prerogatives of the latter, proved that the wife\nof Louis XV. had acted judiciously in abolishing the office; but a kind\nof treaty made between the Queen and the Princess smoothed all\ndifficulties.  The blame for too strong an assertion of claims fell upon\na secretary of the superintendent, who had been her adviser; and\neverything was so arranged that a firm friendship existed between these\ntwo Princesses down to the disastrous period which terminated their\ncareer.",
        "Notwithstanding the enthusiasm which the splendour, grace, and kindness\nof the Queen generally inspired, secret intrigues continued in operation\nagainst her.  A short time after the ascension of Louis XVI. to the\nthrone, the minister of the King’s household was informed that a most\noffensive libel against the Queen was about to appear.  The lieutenant of\npolice deputed a man named Goupil, a police inspector, to trace this\nlibel; he came soon after to say that he had found out the place where\nthe work was being printed, and that it was at a country house near\nYverdun.  He had already got possession of two sheets, which contained\nthe most atrocious calumnies, conveyed with a degree of art which might\nmake them very dangerous to the Queen’s reputation.  Goupil said that he\ncould obtain the rest, but that he should want a considerable sum for\nthat purpose.  Three thousand Louis were given him, and very soon\nafterwards he brought the whole manuscript and all that had been printed\nto the lieutenant of police.  He received a thousand louis more as a\nreward for his address and zeal; and a much more important office was\nabout to be given him, when another spy, envious of Goupil’s good\nfortune, gave information that Goupil himself was the author of the\nlibel; that, ten years before, he had been put into the Bicetre for\nswindling; and that Madame Goupil had been only three years out of the\nSalpetriere, where she had been placed under another name.  This Madame\nGoupil was very pretty and very intriguing; she had found means to form\nan intimacy with Cardinal de Rohan, whom she led, it is said, to hope for\na reconciliation with the Queen.  All this affair was hushed up; but it\nshows that it was the Queen’s fate to be incessantly attacked by the\nmeanest and most odious machinations.",
        "Another woman, named Cahouette de Millers, whose husband held an office\nin the Treasury, being very irregular in conduct, and of a scheming turn\nof mind, had a mania for appearing in the eyes of her friends at Paris as\na person in favour at Court, to which she was not entitled by either\nbirth or office.  During the latter years of the life of Louis XV. she\nhad made many dupes, and picked up considerable sums by passing herself\noff as the King’s mistress.  The fear of irritating Madame du Barry was,\naccording to her, the only thing which prevented her enjoying that title\nopenly.  She came regularly to Versailles, kept herself concealed in a\nfurnished lodging, and her dupes imagined she was secretly summoned to\nCourt.",
        "This woman formed the scheme of getting admission, if possible, to the\npresence of the Queen, or at least causing it to be believed that she had\ndone so.  She adopted as her lover Gabriel de Saint Charles, intendant of\nher Majesty’s finances,–an office, the privileges of which were confined\nto the right of entering the Queen’s apartment on Sunday.  Madame de\nVillers came every Saturday to Versailles with M. de Saint Charles, and\nlodged in his apartment.  M. Campan was there several times.  She painted\ntolerably well, and she requested him to do her the favour to present to\nthe Queen a portrait of her Majesty which she had just copied.  M. Campan\nknew the woman’s character, and refused her.  A few days after, he saw on\nher Majesty’s couch the portrait which he had declined to present to her;\nthe Queen thought it badly painted, and gave orders that it should be\ncarried back to the Princesse de Lamballe, who had sent it to her.  The\nill success of the portrait did not deter the manoeuvrer from following\nup her designs; she easily procured through M. de Saint Charles patents\nand orders signed by the Queen; she then set about imitating her writing,\nand composed a great number of notes and letters, as if written by her\nMajesty, in the tenderest and most familiar style.  For many months she\nshowed them as great secrets to several of her particular friends.\nAfterwards, she made the Queen appear to write to her, to procure various\nfancy articles.  Under the pretext of wishing to execute her Majesty’s\ncommissions accurately, she gave these letters to the tradesmen to read,\nand succeeded in having it said, in many houses, that the Queen had a\nparticular regard for her.  She then enlarged her scheme, and represented\nthe Queen as desiring to borrow 200,000 francs which she had need of, but\nwhich she did not wish to ask of the King from his private funds.  This\nletter, being shown to M. Beranger, ’fermier general’ of the finances,\ntook effect; he thought himself fortunate in being able to render this\nassistance to his sovereign, and lost no time in sending the 200,000\nfrancs to Madame de Villers.  This first step was followed by some\ndoubts, which he communicated to people better informed than himself of\nwhat was passing at Court; they added to his uneasiness; he then went to\nM. de Sartine, who unravelled the whole plot.  The woman was sent to St.\nPelagie; and the unfortunate husband was ruined, by replacing the sum\nborrowed, and by paying for the jewels fraudulently purchased in the\nQueen’s name.  The forged letters were sent to her Majesty; I compared\nthem in her presence with her own handwriting, and the only\ndistinguishable difference was a little more regularity in the letters.",
        "This trick, discovered and punished with prudence and without passion,\nproduced no more sensation out of doors than that of the Inspector\nGoupil.",
        "A year after the nomination of Madame de Lamballe to the post of\nsuperintendent of the Queen’s household, balls and quadrilles gave rise\nto the intimacy of her Majesty with the Comtesse Jules de Polignac.  This\nlady really interested Marie Antoinette.  She was not rich, and generally\nlived upon her estate at Claye.  The Queen was astonished at not having\nseen her at Court earlier.  The confession that her want of fortune had\neven prevented her appearance at the celebration of the marriages of the\nPrinces added to the interest which she had inspired.",
        "The Queen was full of consideration, and took delight in counteracting\nthe injustice of fortune.  The Countess was induced to come to Court by\nher husband’s sister, Madame Diane de Polignac, who had been appointed\nlady of honour to the Comtesse d’Artois.  The Comtesse Jules was really\nfond of a tranquil life; the impression she made at Court affected her\nbut little; she felt only the attachment manifested for her by the Queen.\nI had occasion to see her from the commencement of her favour at Court;\nshe often passed whole hours with me, while waiting for the Queen.  She\nconversed with me freely and ingenuously about the honour, and at the\nsame time the danger, she saw in the kindness of which she was the\nobject.  The Queen sought for the sweets of friendship; but can this\ngratification, so rare in any rank, exist between a Queen and a subject,\nwhen they are surrounded, moreover, by snares laid by the artifice of\ncourtiers?  This pardonable error was fatal to the happiness of Marie\nAntoinette.",
        "The retiring character of the Comtesse Jules, afterwards Duchesse de\nPolignac, cannot be spoken of too favourably; but if her heart was\nincapable of forming ambitious projects, her family and friends in her\nfortune beheld their own, and endeavoured to secure the favour of the\nQueen.",
        "     [The Comtesse, afterwards Duchesse de Polignac, nee Polastron,\n     Married the Comte (in 1780 the Duc) Jules de Polignac, the father of\n     the Prince de Polignac of Napoleon’s and of Charles X.’s time.  She\n     emigrated in 1789, and died in Vienna in 1793.]",
        "The Comtesse de Diane, sister of M. de Polignac, and the Baron de\nBesenval and M. de Vaudreuil, particular friends of the Polignac family,\nmade use of means, the success of which was infallible.  One of my\nfriends (Comte de Moustier), who was in their secret, came to tell me\nthat Madame de Polignac was about to quit Versailles suddenly; that she\nwould take leave of the Queen only in writing; that the Comtesse Diane\nand M. de Vaudreuil had dictated her letter, and the whole affair was\narranged for the purpose of stimulating the attachment of Marie\nAntoinette.  The next day, when I went up to the palace, I found the\nQueen with a letter in her hand, which she was reading with much emotion;\nit was the letter from the Comtesse Jules; the Queen showed it to me.\nThe Countess expressed in it her grief at leaving a princess who had\nloaded her with kindness.  The narrowness of her fortune compelled her to\ndo so; but she was much more strongly impelled by the fear that the\nQueen’s friendship, after having raised up dangerous enemies against her,\nmight abandon her to their hatred, and to the regret of having lost the\naugust favour of which she was the object.",
        "This step produced the full effect that had been expected from it.  A\nyoung and sensitive queen cannot long bear the idea of contradiction.\nShe busied herself in settling the Comtesse Jules near her, by making\nsuch a provision for her as should place her beyond anxiety.  Her\ncharacter suited the Queen; she had merely natural talents, no pedantry,\nno affectation of knowledge.  She was of middle size; her complexion very\nfair, her eyebrows and hair dark brown, her teeth superb, her smile\nenchanting, and her whole person graceful.  She was seen almost always in\na demi-toilet, remarkable only for neatness and good taste.  I do not\nthink I ever once saw diamonds about her, even at the climax of her\nfortune, when she had the rank of Duchess at Court.",
        "I have always believed that her sincere attachment for the Queen, as much\nas her love of simplicity, induced her to avoid everything that might\ncause her to be thought a wealthy favourite.  She had not one of the\nfailings which usually accompany that position.  She loved the persons\nwho shared the Queen’s affections, and was entirely free from jealousy.\nMarie Antoinette flattered herself that the Comtesse Jules and the\nPrincesse de Lamballe would be her especial friends, and that she should\npossess a society formed according to her own taste.  “I will receive\nthem in my closet, or at Trianon,” said she; “I will enjoy the comforts\nof private life, which exist not for us, unless we have the good sense to\nsecure them for ourselves.”  The happiness the Queen thought to secure\nwas destined to turn to vexation.  All those courtiers who were not\nadmitted to this intimacy became so many jealous and vindictive enemies.",
        "It was necessary to make a suitable provision for the Countess.  The\nplace of first equerry, in reversion after the Comte de Tesse, given to\nComte Jules unknown to the titular holder, displeased the family of\nNoailles.  This family had just sustained another mortification, the\nappointment of the Princesse de Lamballe having in some degree rendered\nnecessary the resignation of the Comtesse de Noailles, whose husband was\nthereupon made a marshal of France.  The Princesse de Lamballe, although\nshe did not quarrel with the Queen, was alarmed at the establishment of\nthe Comtesse Jules at Court, and did not form, as her Majesty had hoped,\na part of that intimate society, which was in turn composed of Mesdames\nJules and Diane de Polignac, d’Andlau and de Chalon, and Messieurs de\nGuignes, de Coigny, d’Adhemar, de Besenval, lieutenant-colonel of the\nSwiss, de Polignac, de Vaudreuil, and de Guiche; the Prince de Ligne and\nthe Duke of Dorset, the English ambassador, were also admitted.",
        "It was a long time before the Comtesse Jules maintained any great state\nat Court.  The Queen contented herself with giving her very fine\napartments at the top of the marble staircase.  The salary of first\nequerry, the trifling emoluments derived from M. de Polignac’s regiment,\nadded to their slender patrimony, and perhaps some small pension, at that\ntime formed the whole fortune of the favourite.  I never saw the Queen\nmake her a present of value; I was even astonished one day at hearing her\nMajesty mention, with pleasure, that the Countess had gained ten thousand\nfrancs in the lottery.  “She was in great want of it,” added the Queen.",
        "Thus the Polignacs were not settled at Court in any degree of splendour\nwhich could justify complaints from others, and the substantial favours\nbestowed upon that family were less envied than the intimacy between them\nand their proteges and the Queen.  Those who had no hope of entering the\ncircle of the Comtesse Jules were made jealous by the opportunities of\nadvancement it afforded.",
        "However, at the time I speak of, the society around the Comtesse Jules\nwas fully engaged in gratifying the young Queen.  Of this the Marquis de\nVaudreuil was a conspicuous member; he was a brilliant man, the friend\nand protector of men of letters and celebrated artists.",
        "The Baron de Besenval added to the bluntness of the Swiss all the\nadroitness of a French courtier.  His fifty years and gray hairs made him\nenjoy among women the confidence inspired by mature age, although he had\nnot given up the thought of love affairs.  He talked of his native\nmountains with enthusiasm.  He would at any time sing the “Ranz des\nVaches” with tears in his eyes, and was the best story-teller in the\nComtesse Jules’s circle.  The last new song or ’bon mot’ and the gossip\nof the day were the sole topics of conversation in the Queen’s parties.\nWit was banished from them.  The Comtesse Diane, more inclined to\nliterary pursuits than her sister-in-law, one day, recommended her to\nread the “Iliad” and “Odyssey.”  The latter replied, laughing, that she\nwas perfectly acquainted with the Greek poet, and said to prove it:",
        "          “Homere etait aveugle et jouait du hautbois.”",
        "          (Homer was blind and played on the hautboy.)",
        "     [This lively repartee of the Duchesse de Polignac is a droll\n     imitation of a line in the “Mercure Galant.”  In the quarrel scene\n     one of the lawyers says to his brother quill: ’Ton pere etait\n     aveugle et jouait du hautbois.’]",
        "The Queen found this sort of humour very much to her taste, and said that\nno pedant should ever be her friend.",
        "Before the Queen fixed her assemblies at Madame de Polignac’s, she\noccasionally passed the evening at the house of the Duc and Duchesse de\nDuras, where a brilliant party of young persons met together.  They\nintroduced a taste for trifling games, such as question and answer,\n’guerre panpan’, blind man’s buff, and especially a game called\n’descampativos’.  The people of Paris, always criticising, but always\nimitating the customs of the Court, were infected with the mania for\nthese childish sports.  Madame de Genlis, sketching the follies of the\nday in one of her plays, speaks of these famous ’descampativos’; and also\nof the rage for making a friend, called the ’inseparable’, until a whim\nor the slightest difference might occasion a total rupture.",
        "The Duc de Choiseul had reappeared at Court on the ceremony of the King’s\ncoronation for the first time after his disgrace under Louis XV. in 1770.\nThe state of public feeling on the subject gave his friends hope of\nseeing him again in administration, or in the Council of State; but the\nopposite party was too firmly seated at Versailles, and the young Queen’s\ninfluence was outweighed, in the mind of the King, by long-standing\nprejudices; she therefore gave up for ever her attempt to reinstate the\nDuke.  Thus this Princess, who has been described as so ambitious, and so\nstrenuously supporting the interest of the House of Austria, failed twice\nin the only scheme which could forward the views constantly attributed to\nher; and spent the whole of her reign surrounded by enemies of herself\nand her house.",
        "Marie Antoinette took little pains to promote literature and the fine\narts.  She had been annoyed in consequence of having ordered a\nperformance of the “Connstable de Bourbon,” on the celebration of the\nmarriage of Madame Clotilde with the Prince of Piedmont.  The Court and\nthe people of Paris censured as indecorous the naming characters in the\npiece after the reigning family, and that with which the new alliance was\nformed.  The reading of this piece by the Comte de Guibert in the Queen’s\ncloset had produced in her Majesty’s circle that sort of enthusiasm which\nobscures the judgment.  She promised herself she would have no more\nreadings.  Yet, at the request of M. de Cubieres, the King’s equerry,\nthe Queen agreed to hear the reading of a comedy written by his brother.\nShe collected her intimate circle, Messieurs de Coigny, de Vaudreuil, de\nBesenval, Mesdames de Polignac, de Chalon, etc., and to increase the\nnumber of judges, she admitted the two Parnys, the Chevalier de Bertin,\nmy father-in-law, and myself.",
        "Mold read for the author.  I never could satisfy myself by what magic the\nskilful reader gained our unanimous approbation of a ridiculous work.\nSurely the delightful voice of Mold, by awakening our recollection of the\ndramatic beauties of the French stage, prevented the wretched lines of\nDorat Cubieres from striking on our ears.  I can assert that the\nexclamation Charming! charming! repeatedly interrupted the reader.  The\npiece was admitted for performance at Fontainebleau; and for the first\ntime the King had the curtain dropped before the end of the play.  It was\ncalled the “Dramomane” or “Dramaturge.”  All the characters died of\neating poison in a pie.  The Queen, highly disconcerted at having\nrecommended this absurd production, announced that she would never hear\nanother reading; and this time she kept her word.",
        "The tragedy of “Mustapha and Mangir,” by M. de Chamfort, was highly\nsuccessful at the Court theatre at Fontainebleau.  The Queen procured the\nauthor a pension of 1,200 francs, but his play failed on being performed\nat Paris.",
        "The spirit of opposition which prevailed in that city delighted in\nreversing the verdicts of the Court.  The Queen determined never again to\ngive any marked countenance to new dramatic works.  She reserved her\npatronage for musical composers, and in a few years their art arrived at\na perfection it had never before attained in France.",
        "It was solely to gratify the Queen that the manager of the Opera brought\nthe first company of comic actors to Paris.  Gluck, Piccini, and Sacchini\nwere attracted there in succession.  These eminent composers were treated\nwith great distinction at Court.  Immediately on his arrival in France,\nGluck was admitted to the Queen’s toilet, and she talked to him all the\ntime he remained with her.  She asked him one day whether he had nearly\nbrought his grand opera of “Armide” to a conclusion, and whether it\npleased him.  Gluck replied very coolly, in his German accent, “Madame,\nit will soon be finished, and really it will be superb.”  There was a\ngreat outcry against the confidence with which the composer had spoken of\none of his own productions.  The Queen defended him warmly; she insisted\nthat he could not be ignorant of the merit of his works; that he well\nknew they were generally admired, and that no doubt he was afraid lest a\nmodesty, merely dictated by politeness, should look like affectation in\nhim.",
        "     [Gluck often had to deal with self-sufficiency equal to his own.\n     He was very reluctant to introduce long ballets into “Iphigenia.\"\n     Vestris deeply regretted that the opera was not terminated by a\n     piece they called a chaconne, in which he displayed all his power.\n     He complained to Gluck about it.  Gluck, who treated his art with\n     all the dignity it merits, replied that in so interesting a subject\n     dancing would be misplaced.  Being pressed another time by Vestris\n     on the same subject, “A chaconne!  A chaconne!”  roared out the\n     enraged musician; “we must describe the Greeks; and had the Greeks\n     chaconnes?”  “They had not?”  returned the astonished dancer; “why,\n     then, so much the worse for them!\"–NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]",
        "The Queen did not confine her admiration to the lofty style of the French\nand Italian operas; she greatly valued Gretry’s music, so well adapted to\nthe spirit and feeling of the words.  A great deal of the poetry set to\nmusic by Gretry is by Marmontel.  The day after the first performance of\n\"Zemira and Azor,” Marmontel and Gretry were presented to the Queen as\nshe was passing through the gallery of Fontainebleau to go to mass.  The\nQueen congratulated Gretry on the success of the new opera, and told him\nthat she had dreamed of the enchanting effect of the trio by Zemira’s\nfather and sisters behind the magic mirror.  Gretry, in a transport of\njoy, took Marmontel in his arms, “Ah! my friend,” cried he, “excellent\nmusic may be made of this.\"–\"And execrable words,” coolly observed\nMarmontel, to whom her Majesty had not addressed a single compliment.",
        "The most indifferent artists were permitted to have the honour of\npainting the Queen.  A full-length portrait, representing her in all the\npomp of royalty, was exhibited in the gallery of Versailles.  This\npicture, which was intended for the Court of Vienna, was executed by a\nman who does not deserve even to be named, and disgusted all people of\ntaste.  It seemed as if this art had, in France, retrograded several\ncenturies.",
        "The Queen had not that enlightened judgment, or even that mere taste,\nwhich enables princes to foster and protect great talents.  She confessed\nfrankly that she saw no merit in any portrait beyond the likeness.  When\nshe went to the Louvre, she would run hastily over all the little “genre\"\npictures, and come out, as she acknowledged, without having once raised\nher eyes to the grand compositions.",
        "There is no good portrait of the Queen, save that by Werthmuller, chief\npainter to the King of Sweden, which was sent to Stockholm, and that by\nMadame Lebrun, which was saved from the revolutionary fury by the\ncommissioners for the care of the furniture at Versailles.",
        "     [A sketch of very great interest made when the Queen was in the\n     Temple and discovered many years afterwards there, recently\n     reproduced in the memoirs of the Marquise de Tourzel (Paris, Plon),\n     is the last authentic portrait of the unhappy Queen.  See also the\n     catalogue of portraits made by Lord Ronald Gower.]",
        "The composition of the latter picture resembles that of Henriette of\nFrance, the wife of the unfortunate Charles I., painted by Vandyke.  Like\nMarie Antoinette, she is seated, surrounded by her children, and that\nresemblance adds to the melancholy interest raised by this beautiful\nproduction.",
        "While admitting that the Queen gave no direct encouragement to any art\nbut that of music, I should be wrong to pass over in silence the\npatronage conferred by her and the Princes, brothers of the King, on the\nart of printing.",
        "     [In 1790 the King gave a proof of his particular good-will to the\n     bookselling trade.  A company consisting of the first Parisian\n     booksellers, being on the eve of stopping payment, succeeded in\n     laying before the King a statement of their distressed situation.\n     The monarch was affected by it; he took from the civil list the sum\n     of which the society stood in immediate need, and became security\n     for the repayment of the remainder of the 1,200,000 livres, which\n     they wanted to borrow, and for the repayment of which he fixed no\n     particular time.]",
        "To Marie Antoinette we are indebted for a splendid quarto edition of the\nworks of Metastasio; to Monsieur, the King’s brother, for a quarto Tasso,\nembellished with engravings after Cochin; and to the Comte d’Artois for a\nsmall collection of select works, which is considered one of the chef\nd’oeuvres of the press of the celebrated Didot.",
        "In 1775, on the death of the Marechal du Muy, the ascendency obtained by\nthe sect of innovators occasioned M. de Saint-Germain to be recalled to\nCourt and made Minister of War.  His first care was the destruction of\nthe King’s military household establishment, an imposing and effectual\nrampart round the sovereign power.",
        "When Chancellor Maupeou obtained from Louis XV. the destruction of the\nParliament and the exile of all the ancient magistrates, the\nMousquetaires were charged with the execution of the commission for this\npurpose; and at the stroke of midnight, the presidents and members were\nall arrested, each by two Mousquetaires.  In the spring of 1775 a popular\ninsurrection had taken place in consequence of the high price of bread.\nM. Turgot’s new regulation, which permitted unlimited trade in corn, was\neither its cause or the pretext for it; and the King’s household troops\nagain rendered the greatest services to public tranquillity.",
        "I have never be enable to discover the true cause of the support given to\nM. de Saint-Germain’s policy by the Queen, unless in the marked favour\nshown to the captains and officers of the Body Guards, who by this\nreduction became the only soldiers of their rank entrusted with the\nsafety of the sovereign; or else in the Queen’s strong prejudice against\nthe Duc d’Aiguillon, then commander of the light-horse.  M. de Saint-\nGermain, however, retained fifty gens d’armes and fifty light-horse to\nform a royal escort on state occasions; but in 1787 the King reduced both\nthese military bodies.  The Queen then said with satisfaction that at\nlast she should see no more red coats in the gallery of Versailles.",
        "From 1775 to 1781 were the gayest years of the Queen’s life.  In the\nlittle journeys to Choisy, performances frequently took place at the\ntheatre twice in one day: grand opera and French or Italian comedy at the\nusual hour; and at eleven at night they returned to the theatre for\nparodies in which the best actors of the Opera presented themselves in\nwhimsical parts and costumes.  The celebrated dancer Guimard always took\nthe leading characters in the latter performance; she danced better than\nshe acted; her extreme leanness, and her weak, hoarse voice added to the\nburlesque in the parodied characters of Ernelinde and Iphigenie.",
        "The most magnificent fete ever given to the Queen was one prepared for\nher by Monsieur, the King’s brother, at Brunoy.  That Prince did me the\nhonour to admit me, and I followed her Majesty into the gardens, where\nshe found in the first copse knights in full armour asleep at the foot of\ntrees, on which hung their spears and shields.  The absence of the\nbeauties who had incited the nephews of Charlemagne and the gallants of\nthat period to lofty deeds was supposed to occasion this lethargic\nslumber.  But when the Queen appeared at the entrance of the copse they\nwere on foot in an instant, and melodious voices announced their\neagerness to display their valour.  They then hastened into a vast arena,\nmagnificently decorated in the exact style of the ancient tournaments.\nFifty dancers dressed as pages presented to the knights twenty-five\nsuperb black horses, and twenty-five of a dazzling whiteness, all most\nrichly caparisoned.  The party led by Augustus Vestris wore the Queen’s\ncolours.  Picq, balletmaster at the Russian Court, commanded the opposing\nband.  There was running at the negro’s head, tilting, and, lastly,\ncombats ’a outrance’, perfectly well imitated.  Although the spectators\nwere aware that the Queen’s colours could not but be victorious, they did\nnot the less enjoy the apparent uncertainty.",
        "Nearly all the agreeable women of Paris were ranged upon the steps which\nsurrounded the area of the tourney.  The Queen, surrounded by the royal\nfamily and the whole Court, was placed beneath an elevated canopy.  A\nplay, followed by a ballet-pantomime and a ball, terminated the fete.\nFireworks and illuminations were not spared.  Finally, from a\nprodigiously high scaffold, placed on a rising ground, the words ’Vive\nLouis!  Vive Marie Antoinette!’  were shown in the air in the midst of a\nvery dark but calm night.",
        "Pleasure was the sole pursuit of every one of this young family, with the\nexception of the King.  Their love of it was perpetually encouraged by a\ncrowd of those officious people who, by anticipating the desires and even\nthe passions of princes, find means of showing their zeal, and hope to\ngain or maintain favour for themselves.",
        "Who would have dared to check the amusements of a queen, young, lively,\nand handsome?  A mother or a husband alone would have had the right to do\nit; and the King threw no impediment in the way of Marie Antoinette’s\ninclinations.  His long indifference had been followed by admiration and\nlove.  He was a slave to all the wishes of the Queen, who, delighted with\nthe happy change in the heart and habits of the King, did not\nsufficiently conceal the ascendency she was gaining over him.",
        "The King went to bed every night at eleven precisely; he was very\nmethodical, and nothing was allowed to interfere with his rules.  The\nnoise which the Queen unavoidably made when she returned very late from\nthe evenings which she spent with the Princesse de Gugmenee or the Duc de\nDuras, at last annoyed the King, and it was amicably agreed that the\nQueen should apprise him when she intended to sit up late.  He then began\nto sleep in his own apartment, which had never before happened from the\ntime of their marriage.",
        "During the winter the Queen attended the Opera balls with a single lady\nof the palace, and always found there Monsieur and the Comte d’Artois.\nHer people concealed their liveries under gray cloth greatcoats.  She\nnever thought she was recognized, while all the time she was known to the\nwhole assembly, from the first moment she entered the theatre; they\npretended, however, not to recognise her, and some masquerade manoeuvre\nwas always adopted to give her the pleasure of fancying herself\nincognito.",
        "Louis XVI. determined once to accompany the Queen to a masked ball;\nit was agreed that the King should hold not only the grand but the petit\ncoucher, as if actually going to bed.  The Queen went to his apartment\nthrough the inner corridors of the palace, followed by one of her women\nwith a black domino; she assisted him to put it on, and they went alone\nto the chapel court, where a carriage waited for them, with the captain\nof the Guard of the quarter, and a lady of the palace.  The King was but\nlittle amused, spoke only to two or three persons, who knew him\nimmediately, and found nothing to admire at the masquerade but Punches\nand Harlequins, which served as a joke against him for the royal family,\nwho often amused themselves with laughing at him about it.",
        "An event, simple in itself, brought dire suspicion upon the Queen.  She\nwas going out one evening with the Duchesse de Lupnes, lady of the\npalace, when her carriage broke down at the entrance into Paris; she was\nobliged to alight; the Duchess led her into a shop, while a footman\ncalled a ’fiacre’.  As they were masked, if they had but known how to\nkeep silence, the event would never have been known; but to ride in a\nfiacre is so unusual an adventure for a queen that she had hardly entered\nthe Opera-house when she could not help saying to some persons whom she\nmet there: “That I should be in a fiacre!  Is it not droll?”",
        "From that moment all Paris was informed of the adventure of the fiacre.\nIt was said that everything connected with it was mysterious; that the\nQueen had kept an assignation in a private house with the Duc de Coigny.\nHe was indeed very well received at Court, but equally so by the King and\nQueen.  These accusations of gallantry once set afloat, there were no\nlonger any bounds to the calumnies circulated at Paris.  If, during the\nchase or at cards, the Queen spoke to Lord Edward Dillon, De Lambertye,\nor others, they were so many favoured lovers.  The people of Paris did\nnot know that none of those young persons were admitted into the Queen’s\nprivate circle of friends; the Queen went about Paris in disguise, and\nhad made use of a fiacre; and a single instance of levity gives room for\nthe suspicion of others.",
        "Conscious of innocence, and well knowing that all about her must do\njustice to her private life, the Queen spoke of these reports with\ncontempt, contenting herself with the supposition that some folly in the\nyoung men mentioned had given rise to them.  She therefore left off\nspeaking to them or even looking at them.  Their vanity took alarm at\nthis, and revenge induced them either to say, or to leave others to\nthink, that they were unfortunate enough to please no longer.  Other\nyoung coxcombs, placing themselves near the private box which the Queen\noccupied incognito when she attended the public theatre at Versailles,\nhad the presumption to imagine that they were noticed by her; and I have\nknown such notions entertained merely on account of the Queen’s\nrequesting one of those gentlemen to inquire behind the scenes whether it\nwould be long before the commencement of the second piece.",
        "The list of persons received into the Queen’s closet which I gave in the\npreceding chapter was placed in the hands of the ushers of the chamber by\nthe Princesse de Lamballe; and the persons there enumerated could present\nthemselves to enjoy the distinction only on those days when the Queen\nchose to be with her intimates in a private manner; and this was only\nwhen she was slightly indisposed.  People of the first rank at Court\nsometimes requested special audiences of her; the Queen then received\nthem in a room within that called the closet of the women on duty, and\nthese women announced them in her Majesty’s apartment.",
        "The Duc de Lauzun had a good deal of wit, and chivalrous manners.  The\nQueen was accustomed to see him at the King’s suppers, and at the house\nof the Princesse de Guemenee, and always showed him attention.  One day\nhe made his appearance at Madame de Guemenee’s in uniform, and with the\nmost magnificent plume of white heron’s feathers that it was possible to\nbehold.  The Queen admired the plume, and he offered it to her through\nthe Princesse de Guemenee.  As he had worn it the Queen had not imagined\nthat he could think of giving it to her; much embarrassed with the\npresent which she had, as it were, drawn upon herself, she did not like\nto refuse it, nor did she know whether she ought to make one in return;\nafraid, if she did give anything, of giving either too much or too\nlittle, she contented herself with once letting M. de Lauzun see her\nadorned with the plume.  In his secret “Memoirs” the Duke attaches an\nimportance to his present, which proves him utterly unworthy of an honour\naccorded only to his name and rank",
        "A short time afterwards he solicited an audience; the Queen granted it,\nas she would have done to any other courtier of equal rank.  I was in the\nroom adjoining that in which he was received; a few minutes after his\narrival the Queen reopened the door, and said aloud, and in an angry tone\nof voice, “Go, monsieur.”  M. de Lauzun bowed low, and withdrew.  The\nQueen was much agitated.  She said to me: “That man shall never again\ncome within my doors.”  A few years before the Revolution of 1789 the\nMarechal de Biron died.  The Duc de Lauzun, heir to his name, aspired to\nthe important post of colonel of the regiment of French guards.  The\nQueen, however, procured it for the Duc du Chaatelet.  The Duc de Biron\nespoused the cause of the Duc d’Orleans, and became one of the most\nviolent enemies of Marie Antoinette.",
        "It is with reluctance that I enter minutely on a defence of the Queen\nagainst two infamous accusations with which libellers have dared to swell\ntheir envenomed volumes.  I mean the unworthy suspicions of too strong an\nattachment for the Comte d’Artois, and of the motives for the tender\nfriendship which subsisted between the Queen, the Princesse de Lamballe,\nand the Duchesse de Polignac.  I do not believe that the Comte d’Artois\nwas, during his own youth and that of the Queen, so much smitten as has\nbeen said with the loveliness of his sister-in-law; I can affirm that I\nalways saw that Prince maintain the most respectful demeanour towards the\nQueen; that she always spoke of his good-nature and cheerfulness with\nthat freedom which attends only the purest sentiments; and that none of\nthose about the Queen ever saw in the affection she manifested towards\nthe Comte d’Artois more than that of a kind and tender sister for her\nyoungest brother.  As to the intimate connection between Marie Antoinette\nand the ladies I have named, it never had, nor could have, any other\nmotive than the very innocent wish to secure herself two friends in the\nmidst of a numerous Court; and notwithstanding this intimacy, that tone\nof respect observed by persons of the most exalted rank towards majesty\nnever ceased to be maintained.",
        "The Queen, much occupied with the society of Madame de Polignac, and an\nunbroken series of amusements, found less time for the Abbe de Vermond;\nhe therefore resolved to retire from Court.  The world did him the honour\nto believe that he had hazarded remonstrances upon his august pupil’s\nfrivolous employment of her time, and that he considered himself, both as\nan ecclesiastic and as instructor, now out of place at Court.  But the\nworld was deceived his dissatisfaction arose purely from the favour shown\nto the Comtesse Jules.  After a fortnight’s absence we saw him at\nVersailles again, resuming his usual functions.\r",
        "The Queen could express herself with winning graciousness to persons who\nmerited her praise.  When M. Loustonneau was appointed to the reversion\nof the post of first surgeon to the King, he came to make his\nacknowledgments.  He was much beloved by the poor, to whom he had chiefly\ndevoted his talents, spending nearly thirty thousand francs a year on\nindigent sufferers.  The Queen replied to his thanks by saying: “You are\nsatisfied, Monsieur; but I am far from being so with the inhabitants of\nVersailles.  On the news of your appointment the town should have been\nilluminated.\"–\"How so, Madame?” asked the astonished surgeon, who was\nvery modest.  “Why,” replied the Queen, “if the poor whom you have\nsuccoured for the past twenty years had each placed a single candle in\ntheir windows it would have been the most beautiful illumination ever\nwitnessed.”",
        "The Queen did not limit her kindness to friendly words.  There was\nfrequently seen in the apartments of Versailles a veteran captain of the\ngrenadiers of France, called the Chevalier d’Orville, who for four years\nhad been soliciting from the Minister of War the post of major, or of\nKing’s lieutenant.  He was known to be very poor; but he supported his\nlot without complaining of this vexatious delay in rewarding his\nhonourable services.  He regularly attended the Marechal de Segur,\nat the hour appointed for receiving the numerous solicitations in his\ndepartment.  One day the Marshal said to him: “You are still at\nVersailles, M. d’Orville?\"–\"Monsieur,” he replied, “you may observe that\nby this board of the flooring where I regularly place myself; it is\nalready worn down several lines by the weight of my body.”  The Queen\nfrequently stood at the window of her bedchamber to observe with her\nglass the people walking in the park.  Sometimes she inquired the names\nof those who were unknown to her.  One day she saw the Chevalier\nd’Orville passing, and asked me the name of that knight of Saint Louis,\nwhom she had seen everywhere for a long time past.  I knew who he was,\nand related his history.  “That must be put an end to,” said the Queen,\nwith some vivacity.  “Such an example of indifference is calculated to\ndiscourage our soldiers.”  Next day, in crossing the gallery to go to\nmass, the Queen perceived the Chevalier d’Orville; she went directly\ntowards him.  The poor man fell back in the recess of a window, looking\nto the right and left to discover the person whom the Queen was seeking,\nwhen she thus addressed him: “M. d’Orville, you have been several years\nat Versailles, soliciting a majority or a King’s lieutenancy.  You must\nhave very powerless patrons.\"–\"I have none, Madame,” replied the\nChevalier, in great confusion.  “Well! I will take you under my\nprotection.  To-morrow at the same hour be here with a petition, and a\nmemorial of your services.”  A fortnight after, M. d’Orville was\nappointed King’s lieutenant, either at La Rochelle or at Rochefort.",
        "     [Louis XVI. vied with his Queen in benevolent actions of this kind.\n     An old officer had in vain solicited a pension during the\n     administration of the Duc de Choiseul.  He returned to the charge in\n     the times of the Marquis de Montesnard and the Duc d’Aiguillon.  He\n     urged his claims, to Comte du Muy, who made a note of them.  Tired\n     of so many fruitless efforts, he at last appeared at the King’s\n     supper, and, having placed himself so as to be seen and heard, cried\n     out at a moment when silence prevailed, “Sire.”  The people near him\n     said, “What are you about?  This is not the way to speak to the\n     King.\"–\"I fear nothing,” said he, and raising his voice, repeated,\n     “Sire.”  The King, much surprised, looked at him and said, “What do\n     you want, monsieur.\"–\"Sire,” answered he, “I am seventy years of\n     age; I have served your Majesty more than fifty years, and I am\n     dying for want.\"–\"Have you a memorial?”  replied the King.  “Yes,\n     Sire, I have.\"–\"Give it to me;” and his Majesty took it without\n     saying anything more.  Next morning he was sent for by the, King,\n     who said, “Monsieur, I grant you an annuity of 1,500 livres out of\n     my privy purse, and you may go and receive the first year’s payment,\n     which is now due.”  (\"Secret Correspondence of the Court: Reign of\n     Louis XVI.”) The King preferred to spend money in charity rather\n     than in luxury or magnificence.  Once during his absence, M.\n     d’Augivillers caused an unused room in the King’s apartment to be\n     repaired at a cost of 30,000 francs.  On his return the King made\n     Versailles resound with complaints against M. d’Augivillers: “With\n     that sum I could have made thirty families happy,” he said.]",
        "From the time of Louis XVI.’s accession to the throne, the Queen had been\nexpecting a visit from her brother, the Emperor Joseph II.  That Prince\nwas the constant theme of her discourse.  She boasted of his\nintelligence, his love of occupation, his military knowledge, and the\nperfect simplicity of his manners.  Those about her Majesty ardently\nwished to see at Versailles a prince so worthy of his rank.  At length\nthe coming of Joseph II., under the title of Count Falkenstein, was\nannounced, and the very day on which he would be at Versailles was\nmentioned.  The first embraces between the Queen and her august brother\ntook place in the presence of all the Queen’s household.  The sight of\ntheir emotion was extremely affecting.",
        "The Emperor was at first generally admired in France; learned men, well-\ninformed officers, and celebrated artists appreciated the extent of his\ninformation.  He made less impression at Court, and very little in the\nprivate circle of the King and Queen.  His eccentric manners, his\nfrankness, often degenerating into rudeness, and his evidently affected\nsimplicity,–all these characteristics caused him to be looked upon as a\nprince rather singular than admirable.  The Queen spoke to him about the\napartment she had prepared for him in the Chateau; the Emperor answered\nthat he would not accept it, and that while travelling he always lodged\nat a cabaret (that was his very expression); the Queen insisted, and\nassured him that he should be at perfect liberty, and placed out of the\nreach of noise.  He replied that he knew the Chateau of Versailles was\nvery large, and that so many scoundrels lived there that he could well\nfind a place; but that his valet de chambre had made up his camp-bed in a\nlodging-house, and there he would stay.",
        "He dined with the King and Queen, and supped with the whole family.  He\nappeared to take an interest in the young Princesse Elisabeth, then just\npast childhood, and blooming in all the freshness of that age.  An\nintended marriage between him and this young sister of the King was\nreported at the time, but I believe it had no foundation in truth.",
        "The table was still served by women only, when the Queen dined in private\nwith the King, the royal family, or crowned heads.",
        "     [The custom was, even supposing dinner to have commenced, if a\n     princess of the blood arrived, and she was asked to sit down at the\n     Queen’s table, the comptrollers and gentlemen-in-waiting came\n     immediately to attend, and the Queen’s women withdrew.  These had\n     succeeded the maids of honour in several parts of their service, and\n     had preserved some of their privileges.  One day the Duchesse\n     d’Orleans arrived at Fontainebleau, at the Queen’s dinner-hour.  The\n     Queen invited her to the table, and herself motioned to her women to\n     leave the room, and let the men take their places.  Her Majesty said\n     she was resolved to continue a privilege which kept places of that\n     description most honourable, and render them suitable for ladies of\n     nobility without fortune.  Madame de Misery, Baronne de Biache, the\n     Queen’s first lady of the chamber, to whom I was made reversioner,\n     was a daughter of M. le Comte de Chemant, and her grandmother was a\n     Montmorency.  M. le Prince de Tingry, in the presence of the Queen,\n     used to call her cousin.  The ancient household of the Kings of\n     France had prerogatives acknowledged in the state.  Many of the\n     offices were tenable only by those of noble blood, and were sold at\n     from 40,000 to 300,000 franca.  A collection of edicts of the Kings\n     in favour of the prerogatives and right of precedence of the persons\n     holding office in the royal household is still in existence.]",
        "I was present at the Queen’s dinner almost every day.  The Emperor would\ntalk much and fluently; he expressed himself in French with facility, and\nthe singularity, of his expressions added a zest to his conversation.  I\nhave often heard him say that he liked spectacculous objects, when he\nmeant to express such things as formed a show, or a scene worthy of\ninterest.  He disguised none of his prejudices against the etiquette and\ncustoms of the Court of France; and even in the presence of the King made\nthem the subject of his sarcasms.  The King smiled, but never made any\nanswer; the Queen appeared pained.  The Emperor frequently terminated his\nobservations upon the objects in Paris which he had admired by\nreproaching the King for suffering himself to remain in ignorance of\nthem.  He could not conceive how such a wealth of pictures should remain\nshut up in the dust of immense stores; and told him one day that but for\nthe practice of placing some of them in the apartments of Versailles he\nwould not know even the principal chef d’oeuvres that he possessed.",
        "     [The Emperor loudly censured the existing practice of allowing\n     shopkeepers to erect shops near the outward walls of all the\n     palaces, and even to establish something like a fair in the\n     galleries of Versailles and Fontainebleau, and even upon the\n     landings of the staircases.]",
        "He also reproached him for not having visited the Hotel des Invalides nor\nthe Ecole Militaire; and even went so far as to tell him before us that\nhe ought not only to know what Paris contained, but to travel in France,\nand reside a few days in each of his large towns.",
        "At last the Queen was really hurt at the Emperor’s remarks, and gave him\na few lectures upon the freedom with which he allowed himself to lecture\nothers.  One day she was busied in signing warrants and orders for\npayment for her household, and was conversing with M. Augeard, her\nsecretary for such matters, who presented the papers one after another to\nbe signed, and replaced them in his portfolio.  While this was going\nforward, the Emperor walked about the room; all at once he stood still,\nto reproach the Queen rather severely for signing all those papers\nwithout reading them, or, at least, without running her eye over them;\nand he spoke most judiciously to her upon the danger of signing her name\ninconsiderately.  The Queen answered that very wise principles might be\nvery ill applied; that her secretary, who deserved her implicit\nconfidence, was at that moment laying before her nothing but orders for\npayment of the quarter’s expenses of her household, registered in the\nChamber of Accounts; and that she ran no risk of incautiously giving her\nsignature.",
        "The Queen’s toilet was likewise a never-failing subject for animadversion\nwith the Emperor.  He blamed her for having introduced too many new\nfashions; and teased her about her use of rouge.  One day, while she was\nlaying on more of it than usual, before going to the play, he pointed out\na lady who was in the room, and who was, in truth, highly painted.  “A\nlittle more under the eyes,” said the Emperor to the Queen; “lay on the\nrouge like a fury, as that lady does.”  The Queen entreated her brother\nto refrain from his jokes, or at all events to address them, when they\nwere so outspoken, to her alone.",
        "The Queen had made an appointment to meet her brother at the Italian\ntheatre; she changed her mind, and went to the French theatre, sending a\npage to the Italian theatre to request the Emperor to come to her there.\nHe left his box, lighted by the comedian Clairval, and attended by M. de\nla Ferte, comptroller of the Queen’s privy purse, who was much hurt at\nhearing his Imperial Majesty, after kindly expressing his regret at not\nbeing present during the Italian performance, say to Clairval, “Your\nyoung Queen is very giddy; but, luckily, you Frenchmen have no great\nobjection to that.”",
        "I was with my father-in-law in one of the Queen’s apartments when the\nEmperor came to wait for her there, and, knowing that M. Campan was\nlibrarian, he conversed with him about such books as would of course be\nfound in the Queen’s library.  After talking of our most celebrated\nauthors, he casually said, “There are doubtless no works on finance or\non administration here?”",
        "These words were followed by his opinion on all that had been written on\nthose topics, and the different systems of our two famous ministers,\nSully and Colbert; on errors which were daily committed in France, in\npoints essential to the prosperity of the Empire; and on the reform he\nhimself would make at Vienna.  Holding M. Campan by the button, he spent\nmore than an hour, talking vehemently, and without the slightest reserve,\nabout the French Government.  My father-in-law and myself maintained\nprofound silence, as much from astonishment as from respect; and when we\nwere alone we agreed not to speak of this interview.",
        "The Emperor was fond of describing the Italian Courts that he had\nvisited.  The jealous quarrels between the King and Queen of Naples\namused him highly; he described to the life the manner and speech of that\nsovereign, and the simplicity with which he used to go and solicit the\nfirst chamberlain to obtain permission to return to the nuptial bed, when\nthe angry Queen had banished him from it.  The time which he was made to\nwait for this reconciliation was calculated between the Queen and her\nchamberlain, and always proportioned to the gravity of the offence.  He\nalso related several very amusing stories relative to the Court of Parma,\nof which he spoke with no little contempt.  If what this Prince said of\nthose Courts, and even of Vienna, had been written down, the whole would\nhave formed an interesting collection.  The Emperor told the King that\nthe Grand Duke of Tuscany and the King of Naples being together, the\nformer said a great deal about the changes he had effected in his State.\nThe Grand Duke had issued a mass of new edicts, in order to carry the\nprecepts of the economists into execution, and trusted that in so doing\nhe was labouring for the welfare of his people.  The King of Naples\nsuffered him to go on speaking for a long time, and then casually asked\nhow many Neapolitan families there were in Tuscany.  The Duke soon\nreckoned them up, as they were but few.  “Well, brother,” replied the\nKing of Naples, “I do not understand the indifference of your people\ntowards your great reforms; for I have four times the number of Tuscan\nfamilies settled in my States that you have of Neapolitan families in\nyours.”",
        "The Queen being at the Opera with the Emperor, the latter did not wish to\nshow himself; but she took him by the hand, and gently drew him to the\nfront of the box.  This kind of presentation to the public was most\nwarmly received.  The performance was “Iphigenia in Aulis,” and for the\nsecond time.  the chorus, “Chantons, celebrons notre Reine!” was called\nfor with universal plaudits.",
        "A fete of a novel description was given at Petit Trianon.  The art with\nwhich the English garden was not illuminated, but lighted, produced a\ncharming effect.  Earthen lamps, concealed by boards painted green, threw\nlight upon the beds of shrubs and flowers, and brought out their varied\ntints.  Several hundred burning fagots in the moat behind the Temple of\nLove made a blaze of light, which rendered that spot the most brilliant\nin the garden.  After all, this evening’s entertainment had nothing\nremarkable about it but the good taste of the artists, yet it was much\ntalked of.  The situation did not allow the admission of a great part of\nthe Court; those who were uninvited were dissatisfied; and the people,\nwho never forgive any fetes but those they share in, so exaggerated the\ncost of this little fete as to make it appear that the fagots burnt in\nthe moat had required the destruction of a whole forest.  The Queen being\ninformed of these reports, was determined to know exactly how much wood\nhad been consumed; and she found that fifteen hundred fagots had sufficed\nto keep up the fire until four o’clock in the morning.",
        "After staying a few months the Emperor left France, promising his sister\nto come and see her again.  All the officers of the Queen’s chamber had\nmany opportunities of serving him during his stay, and expected that he\nwould make them presents before his departure.  Their oath of office\npositively forbade them to receive a gift from any foreign prince; they\nhad therefore agreed to refuse the Emperor’s presents at first, but to\nask the time necessary for obtaining permission to accept them.  The\nEmperor, probably informed of this custom, relieved the good people from\ntheir difficulty by setting off without making a single present.",
        "About the latter end of 1777 the Queen, being alone in her closet, sent\nfor my father-in-law and myself, and, giving us her hand to kiss; told us\nthat, looking upon us both as persons deeply interested in her happiness,\nshe wished to receive our congratulations,–that at length she was the\nQueen of France, and that she hoped soon to have children; that till now\nshe had concealed her grief, but that she had shed many tears in secret.",
        "Dating from this happy but long-delayed moment, the King’s attachment to\nthe Queen assumed every characteristic of love.  The good Lassone, first\nphysician to the King and Queen, frequently spoke to me of the uneasiness\nthat the King’s indifference, the cause of which he had been so long in\novercoming, had given him, and appeared to me at that time to entertain\nno anxiety except of a very different description.",
        "In the winter of 1778 the King’s permission for the return of Voltaire;\nafter an absence of twenty-seven years, was obtained.  A few strict\npersons considered this concession on the part of the Court very\ninjudicious.  The Emperor, on leaving France, passed by the Chateau of\nFerney without stopping there.  He had advised the Queen not to suffer\nVoltaire to be presented to her.  A lady belonging to the Court learned\nthe Emperor’s opinion on that point, and reproached him with his want of\nenthusiasm towards the greatest genius of the age.  He replied that for\nthe good of the people he should always endeavour to profit by the\nknowledge of the philosophers; but that his own business of sovereign\nwould always prevent his ranking himself amongst that sect.  The clergy\nalso took steps to hinder Voltaire’s appearance at Court.  Paris,\nhowever, carried to the highest pitch the honours and enthusiasm shown to\nthe great poet.",
        "It was very unwise to let Paris pronounce with such transport an opinion\nso opposite to that of the Court.  This was pointed out to the Queen,\nand she was told that, without conferring on Voltaire the honour of a\npresentation, she might see him in the State apartments.  She was not\naverse to following this advice, and appeared embarrassed solely about\nwhat she should say to him.  She was recommended to talk about nothing\nbut the “Henriade,” “Merope,” and “Zaira.”  The Queen replied that she\nwould still consult a few other persons in whom she had great confidence.\nThe next day she announced that it was irrevocably decided Voltaire\nshould not see any member of the royal family,–his writings being too\nantagonistic to religion and morals.  “It is, however, strange,” said the\nQueen, “that while we refuse to admit Voltaire into our presence as the\nleader of philosophical writers, the Marechale de Mouchy should have\npresented to me some years ago Madame Geoffrin, who owed her celebrity to\nthe title of foster-mother of the philosophers.”",
        "On the occasion of the duel of the Comte d’Artois with the Prince de\nBourbon the Queen determined privately to see the Baron de Besenval,\nwho was to be one of the witnesses, in order to communicate the King’s\nintentions.  I have read with infinite pain the manner in which that\nsimple fact is perverted in the first volume of M. de Besenval’s\n\"Memoirs.”  He is right in saying that M. Campan led him through the\nupper corridors of the Chateau, and introduced him into an apartment\nunknown to him; but the air of romance given to the interview is equally\nculpable and ridiculous.  M. de Besenval says that he found himself,\nwithout knowing how he came there, in an apartment unadorned, but very\nconveniently furnished, of the existence of which he was till then\nutterly ignorant.  He was astonished, he adds, not that the Queen should\nhave so many facilities, but that she should have ventured to procure\nthem.  Ten printed sheets of the woman Lamotte’s libels contain nothing\nso injurious to the character of Marie Antoinette as these lines, written\nby a man whom she honoured by undeserved kindness.  He could not have had\nany opportunity of knowing the existence of the apartments, which\nconsisted of a very small antechamber, a bedchamber, and a closet.  Ever\nsince the Queen had occupied her own apartment, these had been\nappropriated to her Majesty’s lady of honour in cases of illness, and\nwere actually so used when the Queen was confined.  It was so important\nthat it should not be known the Queen had spoken to the Baron before the\nduel that she had determined to go through her inner room into this\nlittle apartment, to which M. Campan was to conduct him.  When men write\nof recent times they should be scrupulously exact, and not indulge in\nexaggerations or inventions.",
        "The Baron de Besenval appears mightily surprised at the Queen’s sudden\ncoolness, and refers it to the fickleness of her disposition.  I can\nexplain the reason for the change by repeating what her Majesty said to\nme at the time; and I will not alter one of her expressions.  Speaking of\nthe strange presumption of men, and the reserve with which women ought\nalways to treat them, the Queen added that age did not deprive them of\nthe hope of pleasing, if they retained any agreeable qualities; that she\nhad treated the Baron de Besenval as a brave Swiss, agreeable, polished,\nand witty, whose gray hairs had induced her to look upon him as a man\nwhom she might see without harm; but that she had been much deceived.\nHer Majesty, after having enjoined me to the strictest secrecy, told me\nthat, finding herself alone with the Baron, he began to address her with\nso much gallantry that she was thrown into the utmost astonishment, and\nthat he was mad enough to fall upon his knees, and make her a declaration\nin form.  The Queen added that she said to him: “Rise, monsieur; the King\nshall be ignorant of an offence which would disgrace you for ever;” that\nthe Baron grew pale and stammered apologies; that she left her closet\nwithout saying another word, and that since that time she hardly ever\nspoke to him.  “It is delightful to have friends,” said the Queen; “but\nin a situation like mine it is sometimes difficult for the friends of our\nfriends to suit us.”",
        "In the beginning of the year 1778 Mademoiselle d’Eon obtained permission\nto return to France, on condition that she should appear there in female\ndress.  The Comte de Vergennes entreated my father, M. Genet, chief clerk\nof Foreign Affairs, who had long known the Chevalier d’Eon, to receive\nthat strange personage at his house, to guide and restrain, if possible,\nher ardent disposition.  The Queen, on learning her arrival at\nVersailles, sent a footman to desire my father to bring her into her\npresence; my father thought it his duty first to inform the Minister of\nher Majesty’s wish.  The Comte de Vergennes expressed himself pleased\nwith my father’s prudence, and desired that he would accompany him to the\nQueen.  The Minister had a few minutes’ audience; her Majesty came out of\nher closet with him, and condescended to express to my father the regret\nshe felt at having troubled him to no purpose; and added, smiling, that a\nfew words from M. de Vergennes had for ever cured her of her curiosity.\nThe discovery in London of the true sex of this pretended woman makes it\nprobable that the few words uttered by the Minister contained a solution\nof the enigma.",
        "The Chevalier d’Eon had been useful in Russia as a spy of Louis XV.\nwhile very young he had found means to introduce himself at the Court of\nthe Empress Elizabeth, and served that sovereign in the capacity of\nreader.  Resuming afterwards his military dress, he served with honour\nand was wounded.  Appointed chief secretary of legation, and afterwards\nminister plenipotentiary at London, he unpardonably insulted Comte de\nGuerchy, the ambassador.  The official order for the Chevalier’s return\nto France was actually delivered to the King’s Council; but Louis XV.\ndelayed the departure of the courier who was to be its bearer, and sent\noff another courier privately, who gave the Chevalier d’Eon a letter in\nhis own writing, in which he said, “I know that you have served me as\neffectually in the dress of a woman as in that which you now wear.\nResume it instantly; withdraw into the city; I warn you that the King\nyesterday signed an order for your return to France; you are not safe in\nyour hotel, and you would here find too powerful enemies.”  I heard the\nChevalier d’Eon repeat the contents of this letter, in which Louis XV.\nthus separated himself from the King of France, several times at my\nfather’s.  The Chevalier, or rather the Chevalaere d’Eon had preserved\nall the King’s letters.  Messieurs de Maurepas and de Vergennes wished to\nget them out of his hands, as they were afraid he would print them.  This\neccentric being had long solicited permission to return to France; but it\nwas necessary to find a way of sparing the family he had offended the\ninsult they would see in his return; he was therefore made to resume the\ncostume of that sex to which in France everything is pardoned.  The\ndesire to see his native land once more determined him to submit to the\ncondition, but he revenged himself by combining the long train of his\ngown and the three deep ruffles on his sleeves with the attitude and\nconversation of a grenadier, which made him very disagreeable company.",
        "     [The account given by Madame Campan of the Chevalier d’Eon is now\n     known to be incorrect in many particulars.  Enough details for most\n     readers will be found in the Duc de Broglie’s “Secret of the King,\"\n     vol.  ii., chaps.  vi.  and g., and at p.  89, vol.  ii.  of that\n     work, where the Duke refers to the letter of most dubious\n     authenticity spoken of by Madame Campan.  The following details will\n     be sufficient for these memoirs: The Chevalier Charles d’Eon de\n     Beaumont (who was born in 1728) was an ex-captain of dragoons,\n     employed in both the open and secret diplomacy of Louis XV.  When at\n     the embassy in London he quarrelled with the ambassador, his\n     superior, the Comte de Guerchy (Marquis do Nangis), and used his\n     possession of papers concerning the secret diplomacy to shield\n     himself.  It was when hiding in London, in 1765, on account of this\n     business, that he seems first to have assumed woman’s dress, which\n     he retained apparently chiefly from love of notoriety.  In 1775 a\n     formal agreement with the French Court, made by the instrumentality\n     of Beaumarchais, of all people in the world, permitted him to return\n     to France, retaining the dress of a woman.  He went back to France,\n     but again came to England, and died there, at his residence in\n     Millman Street, near the Foundling Hospital, May 22, 1710.  He had\n     been a brave and distinguished officer, but his form and a certain\n     coldness of temperament always remarked in him assisted him in his\n     assumption of another sex.  There appears to be no truth in the\n     story of his proceedings at the Russian Court, and his appearing in\n     female attire was a surprise to those who must have known of any\n     earlier affair of the sort.]",
        "At last, the event so long desired by the Queen, and by all those who\nwished her well, took place; her Majesty became enceinte.  The King was\nin ecstasies.  Never was there a more united or happier couple.  The\ndisposition of Louis XVI. entirely altered, and became prepossessing and\nconciliatory; and the Queen was amply compensated for the uneasiness\nwhich the King’s indifference during the early part of their union had\ncaused her.",
        "The summer of 1778 was extremely hot.  July and August passed, but the\nair was not cooled by a single storm.  The Queen spent whole days in\nclose rooms, and could not sleep until she had breathed the fresh night\nair, walking with the Princesses and her brothers upon the terrace under\nher apartments.  These promenades at first gave rise to no remark; but it\noccurred to some of the party to enjoy the music of wind instruments\nduring these fine summer nights.  The musicians belonging to the chapel\nwere ordered to perform pieces suited to instruments of that description,\nupon steps constructed in the middle of the garden.  The Queen, seated on\none of the terrace benches, enjoyed the effect of this music, surrounded\nby all the royal family with the exception of the King, who joined them\nbut, twice, disliking to change his hour of going to bed.",
        "Nothing could be more innocent than these parties; yet Paris, France,\nnay, all Europe, were soon canvassing them in a manner most\ndisadvantageous to the reputation of Marie Antoinette.  It is true that\nall the inhabitants of Versailles enjoyed these serenades, and that there\nwas a crowd near the spot from eleven at night until two or three in the\nmorning.  The windows of the ground floor occupied by Monsieur and Madame\n–[The wife of Monsieur, the Comte de Provence.]– were kept open, and\nthe terrace was perfectly well lighted by the numerous wax candles\nburning in the two apartments.  Lamps were likewise placed in the garden,\nand the lights of the orchestra illuminated the rest of the place.",
        "I do not know whether a few incautious women might not have ventured\nfarther, and wandered to the bottom of the park; it may have been so; but\nthe Queen, Madame, and the Comtesse d’Artois were always arm-in-arm, and\nnever left the terrace.  The Princesses were not remarkable when seated\non the benches, being dressed in cambric muslin gowns, with large straw\nhats and muslin veils, a costume universally adopted by women at that\ntime; but when standing up their different figures always distinguished\nthem; and the persons present stood on one side to let them pass.  It is\ntrue that when they seated themselves upon the benches private\nindividuals would sometimes, to their great amusement, sit down by\ntheir side.",
        "A young clerk in the War Department, either not knowing or pretending not\nto know the Queen, spoke to her of the beauty of the night, and the\ndelightful effect of the music.  The Queen, fancying she was not\nrecognised, amused herself by keeping up the incognito, and they talked\nof several private families of Versailles, consisting of persons\nbelonging to the King’s household or her own.  After a few minutes the\nQueen and Princesses rose to walk, and on leaving the bench curtsied to\nthe clerk.  The young man knowing, or having subsequently discovered,\nthat he had been conversing with the Queen, boasted of it in his office.\nHe was merely, desired to hold his tongue; and so little attention did he\nexcite that the Revolution found him still only a clerk.",
        "Another evening one of Monsieur’s body-guard seated himself near the\nPrincesses, and, knowing them, left the place where he was sitting, and\nplaced himself before the Queen, to tell her that he was very fortunate\nin being able to seize an opportunity of imploring the kindness of his\nsovereign; that he was “soliciting at Court\"–at the word soliciting the\nQueen and Princesses rose hastily and withdrew into Madame’s apartment.–\n[Soulavie has most criminally perverted these two facts.-MADAME CAMPAN.]-\nI was at the Queen’s residence that day.  She talked of this little\noccurrence all the time of her ’coucher’; though she only complained that\none of Monsieur’s guards should have had the effrontery to speak to her.\nHer Majesty added that he ought to have respected her incognito; and that\nthat was not the place where he should have ventured to make a request.\nMadame had recognised him, and talked of making a complaint to his\ncaptain; the Queen opposed it, attributing his error to his ignorance and\nprovincial origin.",
        "The most scandalous libels were based on these two insignificant\noccurrences, which I have related with scrupulous exactness.  Nothing\ncould be more false than those calumnies.  It must be confessed, however,\nthat such meetings were liable to ill consequences.  I ventured to say as\nmuch to the Queen, and informed her that one evening, when her Majesty\nbeckoned to me to go and speak to her, I thought I recognised on the\nbench on which she was sitting two women deeply veiled, and keeping\nprofound silence; that those women were the Comtesse du Barry and her\nsister-in-law; and that my suspicions were confirmed, when, at a few\npaces from the seat, and nearer to her Majesty, I met a tall footman\nbelonging to Madame du Barry, whom I had seen in her service all the time\nshe resided at Court.",
        "My advice was disregarded.  Misled by the pleasure she found in these\npromenades, and secure in the consciousness of blameless conduct, the\nQueen would not see the lamentable results which must necessarily follow.\nThis was very unfortunate; for besides the mortifications they brought\nupon her, it is highly probable that they prompted the vile plot which\ngave rise to the Cardinal de Rohan’s fatal error.",
        "Having enjoyed these evening promenades about a month, the Queen ordered\na private concert within the colonnade which contained the group of Pluto\nand Proserpine.  Sentinels were placed at all the entrances, and ordered\nto admit within the colonnade only such persons as should produce tickets\nsigned by my father-in-law.  A fine concert was performed there by the\nmusicians of the chapel and the female musicians belonging to the.\nQueen’s chamber.  The Queen went with Mesdames de Polignac, de Chalon,\nand d’Andlau, and Messieurs de Polignac, de Coigny, de Besenval, and de\nVaudreuil; there were also a few equerries present.  Her Majesty gave me\npermission to attend the concert with some of my female relations.  There\nwas no music upon the terrace.  The crowd of inquisitive people, whom the\nsentinels kept at a distance from the enclosure of the colonnade, went\naway highly discontented; the small number of persons admitted no doubt\noccasioned jealousy, and gave rise to offensive comments which were\ncaught up by the public with avidity.  I do not pretend to apologise for\nthe kind of amusements with which the Queen indulged herself during this\nand the following summer; the consequences were so lamentable that the\nerror was no doubt very great; but what I have said respecting the\ncharacter of these promenades may be relied on as true.",
        "When the season for evening walks was at an end, odious couplets were\ncirculated in Paris; the ’Queen was treated in them in the most insulting\nmanner; her situation ranked among her enemies persons attached to the\nonly prince who for several years had appeared likely to give heirs to\nthe crown.  People uttered the most inconsiderate language; and those\nimproper conversations took place in societies wherein the imminent\ndanger of violating to so criminal an extent both truth and the respect\ndue to sovereigns ought to have been better understood.  A few days\nbefore the Queen’s confinement a whole volume of manuscript songs,\nconcerning her and all the ladies about her remarkable for rank or\nstation was, thrown down in the oiel-de-boeuf.–[A large room at\nVersailles lighted by a bull’s-eye window, and used as a waiting-room.]–\nThis manuscript was immediately put into the hands of the King, who was\nhighly incensed at it, and said that he had himself been at those\npromenades; that he had seen nothing connected with them but what was\nperfectly harmless; that such songs would disturb the harmony of twenty\nfamilies in the Court and city; that it was a capital crime to have made\nany against the Queen herself; and that he wished the author of the\ninfamous libels to be discovered and punished.  A fortnight afterwards it\nwas known publicly that the verses were by M. Champcenetz de Riquebourg,\nwho was not even reprimanded.",
        "     [The author of a great many songs, some of which are very well\n     written.  Lively and satirical by nature, he did not lose either his\n     cheerfulness or his carelessness before the revolutionary tribunal.\n     After hearing his own sentence read, he asked his judges if he might\n     not be allowed to find a substitute.–MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "I knew for a certainty that the King spoke to M. de Maurepas, before two\nof his most confidential servants, respecting the risk which he saw the\nQueen ran from these night walks upon the terrace of Versailles, which\nthe public ventured to censure thus openly, and that the old minister had\nthe cruelty to advise that she should be suffered to go on; she possessed\ntalent; her friends were very ambitious, and longed to see her take a\npart in public affairs; and to let her acquire the reputation of levity\nwould do no harm.  M. de Vergennes was as hostile to the Queen’s\ninfluence as M. de Maurepas.  It may therefore be fairly presumed, since\nthe Prime Minister durst point out to his King an advantage to be gained\nby the Queen’s discrediting herself, that he and M. de Vergennes employed\nall means within the reach of powerful ministers in order to ruin her in\nthe opinion of the public.",
        "The Queen’s accouchement approached; Te Deums were sung and prayers\noffered up in all the cathedrals.  On the 11th of December, 1778, the\nroyal family, the Princes of the blood, and the great officers of State\npassed the night in the rooms adjoining the Queen’s bedchamber.  Madame,\nthe King’s daughter, came into the world before mid-day on the 19th of\nDecember.–[Marie Therese Charlotte (1778-1861), Madame Royale; married\nin 1799 Louis, Duc d’Angouleme, eldest son of the Comte d’Artois.]–\nThe etiquette of allowing all persons indiscriminately to enter at the\nmoment of the delivery of a queen was observed with such exaggeration\nthat when the accoucheur said aloud, “La Reine va s’accoucher,” the\npersons who poured into the chamber were so numerous that the rush nearly\ndestroyed the Queen.  During the night the King had taken the precaution\nto have the enormous tapestry screens which surrounded her Majesty’s bed\nsecured with cords; but for this they certainly would have been thrown\ndown upon her.  It was impossible to move about the chamber, which was\nfilled with so motley a crowd that one might have fancied himself in some\nplace of public amusement.  Two Savoyards got upon the furniture for a\nbetter sight of the Queen, who was placed opposite the fireplace.",
        "The noise and the sex of the infant, with which the Queen was made\nacquainted by a signal previously agreed on, as it is said, with the\nPrincesse do Lamballe, or some error of the accoucheur, brought on\nsymptoms which threatened fatal consequences; the accoucheur exclaimed,\n\"Give her air–warm water–she must be bled in the foot!”  The windows\nwere stopped up; the King opened them with a strength which his affection\nfor the Queen gave him at the moment.  They were of great height, and\npasted over with strips of paper all round.  The basin of hot water not\nbeing brought quickly enough, the accoucheur desired the chief surgeon to\nuse his lancet without waiting for it.  He did so; the blood streamed out\nfreely, and the Queen opened her eyes.  The Princesse de Lamballe was\ncarried through the crowd in a state of insensibility.  The valets de\nchambre and pages dragged out by the collar such inconsiderate persons as\nwould not leave the room.  This cruel custom was abolished afterwards.\nThe Princes of the family, the Princes of the blood, the chancellor, and\nthe ministers are surely sufficient to attest the legitimacy of an\nhereditary prince.  The Queen was snatched from the very jaws of death;\nshe was not conscious of having been bled, and on being replaced in bed\nasked why she had a linen bandage upon her foot.",
        "The delight which succeeded the moment of fear was equally lively and\nsincere.  We were all embracing each other, and shedding tears of joy.\nThe Comte d’Esterhazy and the Prince de Poix, to whom I was the first to\nannounce that the Queen was restored to life, embraced me in the midst of\nthe cabinet of nobles.  We little imagined, in our happiness at her\nescape from death, for how much more terrible a fate our beloved Princess\nwas reserved.",
        "NOTE.  The two following specimens of the Emperor Joseph’s correspondence\nforcibly demonstrate the vigour, shrewdness, and originality of his mind,\nand complete the portrait left of him by Madame Campan.",

        "During the alarm for the life of the Queen, regret at not possessing an\nheir to the throne was not even thought of.  The King himself was wholly\noccupied with the care of preserving an adored wife.  The young Princess\nwas presented to her mother.  “Poor little one,” said the Queen, “you\nwere not wished for, but you are not on that account less dear to me.  A\nson would have been rather the property of the State.  You shall be mine;\nyou shall have my undivided care, shall share all my happiness, and\nconsole me in all my troubles.”",
        "The King despatched a courier to Paris, and wrote letters himself to\nVienna, by the Queen’s bedside; and part of the rejoicings ordered took\nplace in the capital.",
        "A great number of attendants watched near the Queen during the first\nnights of her confinement.  This custom distressed her; she knew how to\nfeel for others, and ordered large armchairs for her women, the backs of\nwhich were capable of being let down by springs, and which served\nperfectly well instead of beds.",
        "M. de Lassone, the chief physician, the chief surgeon, the chief\napothecary, the principal officers of the buttery, etc., were likewise\nnine nights without going to bed.  The royal children were watched for a\nlong time, and one of the women on duty remained, nightly, up and\ndressed, during the first three years from their birth.",
        "The Queen made her entry into Paris for the churching.  One hundred\nmaidens were portioned and married at Notre-Dame.  There were few popular\nacclamations, but her Majesty was perfectly well received at the Opera.",
        "A few days after the Queen’s recovery from her confinement, the Cure of\nthe Magdelaine de la City at Paris wrote to M. Campan and requested a\nprivate interview with him; it was to desire he would deliver into the\nhands of the Queen a little box containing her wedding ring, with this\nnote written by the Cure: “I have received under the seal of confession\nthe ring which I send to your Majesty; with an avowal that it was stolen\nfrom you in 1771, in order to be used in sorceries, to prevent your\nhaving any children.”  On seeing her ring again the Queen said that she\nhad in fact lost it about seven years before, while washing her hands,\nand that she had resolved to use no endeavour to discover the\nsuperstitious woman who had done her the injury.",
        "The Queen’s attachment to the Comtesse Jules increased every day; she\nwent frequently to her house at Paris, and even took up her own abode at\nthe Chateau de la Muette to be nearer during her confinement.  She\nmarried Mademoiselle de Polignac, when scarcely thirteen years of age, to\nM. de Grammont, who, on account of this marriage, was made Duc de Guiche,\nand captain of the King’s Guards, in reversion after the Duc de Villeroi.\nThe Duchesse de Civrac, Madame Victoire’s dame d’honneur, had been\npromised the place for the Duc de Lorges, her son.  The number of\ndiscontented families at Court increased.",
        "The title of favourite was too openly given to the Comtesse Jules by her\nfriends.  The lot of the favourite of a queen is not, in France, a happy\none; the favourites of kings are treated, out of gallantry, with much\ngreater indulgence.",
        "A short time after the birth of Madame the Queen became again enceinte;\nshe had mentioned it only to the King, to her physician, and to a few\npersons honoured with her intimate confidence, when, having overexerted\nher strength in pulling lip one of the glasses of her carriage, she felt\nthat she had hurt herself, and eight days afterwards she miscarried.  The\nKing spent the whole morning at her bedside, consoling her, and\nmanifesting the tenderest concern for her.  The Queen wept exceedingly;\nthe King took her affectionately in his arms, and mingled his tears with\nhers.  The King enjoined silence among the small number of persons who\nwere informed of this unfortunate occurrence; and it remained generally\nunknown.  These particulars furnish an accurate idea of the manner in\nwhich this august couple lived together.",
        "The Empress Maria Theresa did not enjoy the happiness of seeing her\ndaughter give an heir to the crown of France.  That illustrious Princess\ndied at the close of 1780, after having proved by her example that, as in\nthe instance of Queen Blanche, the talents of a sovereign might be\nblended with the virtues of a pious princess.  The King was deeply\naffected at the death of the Empress; and on the arrival of the courier\nfrom Vienna said that he could not bring himself to afflict the Queen by\ninforming her of an event which grieved even him so much.  His Majesty\nthought the Abbe de Vermond, who had possessed the confidence of Maria\nTheresa during his stay at Vienna, the most proper person to discharge\nthis painful duty.  He sent his first valet de chambre, M. de Chamilly,\nto the Abbe on the evening of the day he received the despatches from\nVienna, to order him to come the next day to the Queen before her\nbreakfast hour, to acquit himself discreetly of the afflicting commission\nwith which he was charged, and to let his Majesty know the moment of his\nentering the Queen’s chamber.  It was the King’s intention to be there\nprecisely a quarter of an hour after him, and he was punctual to his\ntime; he was announced; the Abbe came out; and his Majesty said to him,\nas he drew up at the door to let him pass, “I thank you, Monsieur l’Abbe,\nfor the service you have just done me.”  This was the only time during\nnineteen years that the King spoke to him.",
        "Within an hour after learning the event the Queen put on temporary\nmourning, while waiting until her Court mourning should be ready; she\nkept herself shut up in her apartments for several days; went out only to\nmass; saw none but the royal family; and received none but the Princesse\nde Lamballe and the Duchesse de Polignac.  She talked incessantly of the\ncourage, the misfortunes, the successes, and the virtues of her mother.\nThe shroud and dress in which Maria Theresa was to be buried, made\nentirely by her own hands, were found ready prepared in one of her\nclosets.  She often regretted that the numerous duties of her august\nmother had prevented her from watching in person over the education of\nher daughters; and modestly said that she herself would have been more\nworthy if she had had the good fortune to receive lessons directly from a\nsovereign so enlightened and so deserving of admiration.",
        "The Queen told me one day that her mother was left a widow at an age when\nher beauty was yet striking; that she was secretly informed of a plot\nlaid by her three principal ministers to make themselves agreeable to\nher; of a compact made between them, that the losers should not feel any\njealousy towards him who should be fortunate enough to gain his\nsovereign’s heart; and that they had sworn that the successful one should\nbe always the friend of the other two.  The Empress being assured of this\nscheme, one day after the breaking up of the council over which she had\npresided, turned the conversation upon the subject of female sovereigns,\nand the duties of their sex and rank; and then applying her general\nreflections to herself in particular, told them that she hoped to guard\nherself all her life against weaknesses of the heart; but that if ever an\nirresistible feeling should make her alter her resolution, it should be\nonly in favour of a man proof against ambition, not engaged in State\naffairs, but attached only to a private life and its calm enjoyments,–in\na word, if her heart should betray her so far as to lead her to love a\nman invested with any important office, from the moment he should\ndiscover her sentiments he would forfeit his place and his influence with\nthe public.  This was sufficient; the three ministers, more ambitious\nthan amorous, gave up their projects for ever.",
        "On the 22d of October, 1781, the Queen gave birth to a Dauphin.–\n[The first Dauphin, Louis, born 1781, died 1789.]–So deep a silence\nprevailed in the room that the Queen thought her child was a daughter;\nbut after the Keeper of the Seals had declared the sex of the infant, the\nKing went up to the Queen’s bed, and said to her, “Madame, you have\nfulfilled my wishes and those of France:, you are the mother of a\nDauphin.”  The King’s joy was boundless; tears streamed from his eyes; he\ngave his hand to every one present; and his happiness carried away his\nhabitual reserve.  Cheerful and affable, he was incessantly taking\noccasion to introduce the words, “my son,” or “the Dauphin.”  As soon as\nthe Queen was in bed, she wished to see the long-looked-for infant.  The\nPrincesse de Guemenee brought him to her.  The Queen said there was no\nneed for commending him to the Princess, but in order to enable her to\nattend to him more freely, she would herself share the care of the\neducation of her daughter.  When the Dauphin was settled in his\napartment, he received the customary homages and visits.  The Duc\nd’Angouleme,  meeting his father at the entrance of the Dauphin’s\napartment, said to him, “Oh, papa! how little my cousin is!\"–\"The day\nwill come when you will think him great enough, my dear,” answered the\nPrince, almost involuntarily.–[Eldest son of the Comte d’Artois, and\ntill the birth of the Dauphin with near prospects of the succession.]",
        "The birth of the Dauphin appeared to give joy to all classes.  Men\nstopped one another in the streets, spoke without being acquainted,\nand those who were acquainted embraced each other.  In the birth of a\nlegitimate heir to the sovereign every man beholds a pledge of prosperity\nand tranquillity .",
        "     [M. Merard de Saint Just made a quatrain on the birth of the Dauphin\n     to the following effect:",
        "          “This infant Prince our hopes are centred in,\n          will doubtless make us happy, rich, and free;\n          And since with somebody he must begin,\n          My fervent prayer is–that it may be me!”",
        "     –note By the Editor.]",
        "The rejoicings were splendid and ingenious.  The artificers and tradesmen\nof Paris spent considerable sums in order to go to Versailles in a body,\nwith their various insignia.  Almost every troop had music with it.  When\nthey arrived at the court of the palace, they there arranged themselves\nso as to present a most interesting living picture.  Chimney-sweepers,\nquite as well dressed as those that appear upon the stage, carried an\nornamented chimney, at the top of which was perched one of the smallest\nof their fraternity.  The chairmen carried a sedan highly gilt, in which\nwere to be seen a handsome nurse and a little Dauphin.  The butchers made\ntheir appearance with their fat ox.  Cooks, masons, blacksmiths, all\ntrades were on the alert.  The smiths hammered away upon an anvil, the\nshoemakers finished off a little pair of boots for the Dauphin, and the\ntailors a little suit of the uniform of his regiment.  The King remained\na long time upon a balcony to enjoy the sight.  The whole Court was\ndelighted with it.  So general was the enthusiasm that (the police not\nhaving carefully examined the procession) the grave-diggers had the\nimprudence to send their deputation also, with the emblematic devices of\ntheir ill-omened occupation.  They were met by the Princesse Sophie, the\nKing’s aunt, who was thrilled with horror at the sight, and entreated the\nKing to have the audacious, fellows driven out of the procession, which\nwas then drawing up on the terrace.",
        "The ’dames de la halle’ came to congratulate the Queen, and were received\nwith the suitable ceremonies.",
        "Fifty of them appeared dressed in black silk gowns, the established full\ndress of their order, and almost all wore diamonds.  The Princesse de\nChimay went to the door of the Queen’s bedroom to receive three of these\nladies, who were led up to the Queen’s bed.  One of them addressed her\nMajesty in a speech written by M. de la Harpe.  It was set down on the\ninside of a fan, to which the speaker repeatedly referred, but without\nany embarrassment.  She was handsome, and had a remarkably fine voice.\nThe Queen was affected by the address, and answered it with great\naffability,–wishing a distinction to be made between these women and the\npoissardes, who always left a disagreeable impression on her mind.",
        "The King ordered a substantial repast for all these women.  One of his\nMajesty’s maitres d’hotel, wearing his hat, sat as president and did the\nhonours of the table.  The public were admitted, and numbers of people\nhad the curiosity to go.",
        "The Garden-du-Corps obtained the King’s permission to give the Queen a\ndress ball in the great hall of the Opera at Versailles.  Her Majesty\nopened the ball in a minuet with a private selected by the corps, to whom\nthe King granted the baton of an exempt.  The fete was most splendid.\nAll then was joy, happiness, and peace.",
        "The Dauphin was a year old when the Prince de Guemenee’s bankruptcy\ncompelled the Princess, his wife, who was governess to the children of\nFrance, to resign her situation.",
        "The Queen was at La Muette for the inoculation of her daughter.  She sent\nfor me, and condescended to say she wished to converse with me about a\nscheme which delighted her, but in the execution of which she foresaw\nsome inconveniences.  Her plan was to appoint the Duchesse de Polignac to\nthe office lately held by the Princesse de Guemenee.  She saw with\nextreme pleasure the facilities which this appointment would give her for\nsuperintending the education of her children, without running any risk of\nhurting the pride of the governess; and that it would bring together the\nobjects of her warmest affections, her children and her friend.  “The\nfriends of the Duchesse de Polignac,” continued the Queen, “will be\ngratified by the splendour and importance conferred by the employment.\nAs to the Duchess, I know her; the place by no means suits her simple and\nquiet habits, nor the sort of indolence of her disposition.  She will\ngive me the greatest possible proof of her devotion if she yields to my\nwish.”  The Queen also spoke of the Princesse de Chimay and the Duchesse\nde Duras, whom the public pointed out as fit for the post; but she\nthought the Princesse de Chimay’s piety too rigid; and as to the Duchesse\nde Duras, her wit and learning quite frightened her.  What the Queen\ndreaded as the consequence of her selection of the Duchesse de Polignac\nwas principally the jealousy of the courtiers; but she showed so lively a\ndesire to see her scheme executed that I had no doubt she would soon set\nat naught all the obstacles she discovered.  I was not mistaken; a few\ndays afterwards the Duchess was appointed governess.",
        "The Queen’s object in sending for me was no doubt to furnish me with the\nmeans of explaining the feelings which induced her to prefer a governess\ndisposed by friendship to suffer her to enjoy all the privileges of a\nmother.  Her Majesty knew that I saw a great deal of company.",
        "The Queen frequently dined with the Duchess after having been present at\nthe King’s private dinner.  Sixty-one thousand francs were therefore\nadded to the salary of the governess as a compensation for this increase\nof expense.",
        "The Queen was tired of the excursions to Marly, and had no great\ndifficulty in setting the King against them.  He did not like the expense\nof them, for everybody was entertained there gratis.  Louis XIV. had\nestablished a kind of parade upon these excursions, differing from that\nof Versailles, but still more annoying.  Card and supper parties occurred\nevery day, and required much dress.  On Sundays and holidays the\nfountains played, the people were admitted into the gardens, and there\nwas as great a crowd as at the fetes of St. Cloud.",
        "Every age has its peculiar colouring; Marly showed that of Louis XIV.\neven more than Versailles.  Everything in the former place appeared to\nhave been produced by the magic power of a fairy’s wand.  Not the\nslightest trace of all this splendour remains; the revolutionary spoilers\neven tore up the pipes which served to supply the fountains.  Perhaps a\nbrief description of this palace and the usages established there by\nLouis XIV.  may be acceptable.",
        "The very extensive gardens of Marly ascended almost imperceptibly to the\nPavilion of the Sun., which was occupied only by the King and his family.\nThe pavilions of the twelve zodiacal signs bounded the two sides of the\nlawn.  They were connected by bowers impervious to the rays of the sun.\nThe pavilions nearest to that of the sun were reserved for the Princes of\nthe blood and the ministers; the rest were occupied by persons holding\nsuperior offices at Court, or invited to stay at Marly.  Each pavilion\nwas named after fresco paintings, which covered its walls, and which had\nbeen executed by the most celebrated artists of the age of Louis XIV.\nOn a line with the upper pavilion there was on the left a chapel; on the\nright a pavilion called La Perspective, which concealed along suite of\noffices, containing a hundred lodging-rooms intended for the persons\nbelonging to the service of the Court, kitchens, and spacious dining-\nrooms, in which more than thirty tables were splendidly laid out.",
        "During half of Louis XV.’s reign the ladies still wore the habit de cour\nde Marly, so named by Louis XIV., and which differed little from, that\ndevised for Versailles.  The French gown, gathered in the back, and with\ngreat hoops, replaced this dress, and continued to be worn till the end\nof the reign of Louis XVI.  The diamonds, feathers, rouge, and\nembroidered stuffs spangled with gold, effaced all trace of a rural\nresidence; but the people loved to see the splendour of their sovereign\nand a brilliant Court glittering in the shades of the woods.",
        "After dinner, and before the hour for cards, the Queen, the Princesses,\nand their ladies, paraded among the clumps of trees, in little carriages,\nbeneath canopies richly embroidered with gold, drawn by men in the King’s\nlivery.  The trees planted by Louis XIV. were of prodigious height,\nwhich, however, was surpassed in several of the groups by fountains of\nthe clearest water; while, among others, cascades over white marble, the\nwaters of which, met by the sunbeams, looked like draperies of silver\ngauze, formed a contrast to the solemn darkness of the groves.",
        "In the evening nothing more was necessary for any well-dressed man to\nprocure admission to the Queen’s card parties than to be named and\npresented, by some officer of the Court, to the gentleman usher of the\ncard-room.  This room, which was very, large, and of octagonal shape,\nrose to the top of the Italian roof, and terminated in a cupola furnished\nwith balconies, in which ladies who had not been presented easily\nobtained leave to place themselves, and enjoy, the sight of the brilliant\nassemblage.",
        "Though not of the number of persons belonging to the Court, gentlemen\nadmitted into this salon might request one of the ladies seated with the\nQueen at lansquenet or faro to bet upon her cards with such gold or notes\nas they presented to her.  Rich people and the gamblers of Paris did not\nmiss one of the evenings at the Marly salon, and there were always\nconsiderable sums won and lost.  Louis XVI.  hated high play, and very\noften showed displeasure when the loss of large sums was mentioned.  The\nfashion of wearing a black coat without being in mourning had not then\nbeen introduced, and the King gave a few of his ’coups de boutoir’ to\ncertain chevaliers de St. Louis, dressed in this manner, who came to\nventure two or three louis, in the hope that fortune would favour the\nhandsome duchesses who deigned to place them on their cards.",
        "     [Bachaumont in his “Memoirs,” (tome xii., p. 189), which are often\n     satirical; and always somewhat questionable, speaks of the singular\n     precautions taken at play at Court.  “The bankers at the Queen’s\n     table,” says he, “in order to prevent the mistakes [I soften the\n     harshness of his expression] which daily happen, have obtained\n     permission from her Majesty that before beginning to play the table\n     shall be bordered by a ribbon entirely round it, and that no other\n     money than that upon the cards beyond the ribbon shall be considered\n     as staked.\"–NOTE By THE EDITOR.]",
        "Singular contrasts are often seen amidst the grandeur of courts.  In\norder to manage such high play at the Queen’s faro table, it was\nnecessary to have a banker provided with large, sums of money; and this\nnecessity placed at the table, to which none but the highest titled\npersons were admitted in general, not only M. de Chalabre, who was its\nbanker, but also a retired captain of foot, who officiated as his second.\nA word, trivial, but perfectly appropriate to express the manner in which\nthe Court was attended there, was often heard.  Gentlemen presented at\nCourt, who had not been invited to stay at Marly, came there\nnotwithstanding, as they did to Versailles, and returned again to Paris;\nunder such circumstances, it was said such a one had been to Marly only\n’en polisson’;–[A contemptuous expression, meaning literally “as a\nscamp” or “rascal\"]–and it appeared odd to hear a captivating marquis,\nin answer to the inquiry whether he was of the royal party at Marly, say,\n\"No, I am only here ’en polisson’,” meaning simply “I am here on the\nfooting of all those whose nobility is of a later date than 1400.”  The\nMarly excursions were exceedingly expensive to the King.  Besides the\nsuperior tables, those of the almoners, equerries, maitres d’hotel, etc.,\nwere all supplied with such a degree of magnificence as to allow of\ninviting strangers to them; and almost all the visitors from Paris were\nboarded at the expense of the Court.",
        "The personal frugality of the unfortunate Prince who sank beneath the\nweight of the national debts thus favoured the Queen’s predilection for\nher Petit Trianon; and for five or six years preceding the Revolution the\nCourt very seldom visited Marly.",
        "The King, always attentive to the comfort of his family, gave Mesdames,\nhis aunts, the use of the Chateau de Bellevue, and afterwards purchased\nthe Princesse de Guemenee’s house, at the entrance to Paris, for\nElisabeth.  The Comtesse de Provence bought a small house at Montreuil;\nMonsieur already had Brunoy; the Comtesse d’Artois built Bagatelle;\nVersailles became, in the estimation of all the royal family, the least\nagreeable of residences.  They only fancied themselves at home in the\nplainest houses, surrounded by English gardens, where they better enjoyed\nthe beauties of nature.  The taste for cascades and statues was entirely\npast.",
        "The Queen occasionally remained a whole month at Petit Trianon, and had\nestablished there all the ways of life in a chateau.  She entered the\nsitting-room without driving the ladies from their pianoforte or\nembroidery.  The gentlemen continued their billiards or backgammon\nwithout suffering her presence to interrupt them.  There was but little\nroom in the small Chateau of Trianon.  Madame Elisabeth accompanied the\nQueen there, but the ladies of honour and ladies of the palace had no\nestablishment at Trianon.  When invited by the Queen, they came from\nVersailles to dinner.  The King and Princes came regularly to sup.  A\nwhite gown, a gauze kerchief, and a straw hat were the uniform dress of\nthe Princesses.",
        "     [The extreme simplicity of the Queen’s toilet began to be strongly\n     censured, at first among the courtiers, and afterwards throughout\n     the kingdom; and through one of those inconsistencies more common in\n     France than elsewhere, while the Queen was blamed, she was blindly\n     imitated.  There was not a woman but would have the same undress,\n     the same cap, and the same feathers as she had been seen to wear.\n     They crowded to Mademoiselle Bertin, her milliner; there was an\n     absolute revolution in the dress of our ladies, which gave\n     importance to that woman.  Long trains, and all those fashions which\n     confer a certain nobility on dress, were discarded; and at last a\n     duchess could not be distinguished from an actress.  The men caught\n     the mania; the upper classes had long before given up to their\n     lackeys feathers, tufts of ribbon, and laced hats.  They now got rid\n     of red heels and embroidery; and walked about our streets in plain\n     cloth, short thick shoes, and with knotty cudgels in their hands.\n     Many humiliating scrapes were the consequence of this metamorphosis.\n     Bearing no mark to distinguish them from the common herd, some of\n     the lowest classes got into quarrels with them, in which the nobles\n     had not always the best of it.–MONTJOIE, “History of Marie\n     Antoinette.\"]",
        "Examining all the manufactories of the hamlet, seeing the cows milked,\nand fishing in the lake delighted the Queen; and every year she showed\nincreased aversion to the pompous excursions to Marly.",
        "The idea of acting comedies, as was then done in almost all country\nhouses, followed on the Queen’s wish to live at Trianon without ceremony.",
        "     [The Queen got through the characters she assumed indifferently\n     enough; she could hardly be ignorant of this, as her performances\n     evidently excited little pleasure.  Indeed, one day while she was\n     thus exhibiting, somebody ventured to say, by no means inaudibly,\n     “well, this is royally ill played!”  The lesson was thrown away upon\n     her, for never did she sacrifice to the opinion of another that\n     which she thought permissible.  When she was told that her extreme\n     plainness in dress, the nature of her amusements, and her dislike to\n     that splendour which ought always to attend a Queen, had an\n     appearance of levity, which was misinterpreted by a portion of the\n     public, she replied with Madame de Maintenon: “I am upon the stage,\n     and of course I shall be either hissed or applauded.”  Louis XIV.\n     had a similar taste; he danced upon the stage; but he had shown by\n     brilliant actions that he knew how to enforce respect; and besides,\n     he unhesitatingly gave up the amusement from the moment he heard\n     those beautiful lines in which Racine pointed out how very unworthy\n     of him such pastimes were.–MONTJOIE, “History of Marie\n     Antoinette.\"]",
        "It was agreed that no young man except the Comte d’Artois should be\nadmitted into the company of performers, and that the audience should\nconsist only of the King, Monsieur, and the Princesses, who did not play;\nbut in order to stimulate the actors a little, the first boxes were to be\noccupied by the readers, the Queen’s ladies, their sisters and daughters,\nmaking altogether about forty persons.",
        "The Queen laughed heartily at the voice of M. d’Adhemar, formerly a very\nfine one, but latterly become rather tremulous.  His shepherd’s dress in\nColin, in the “Devin du Village,” contrasted very ridiculously with his\ntime of life, and the Queen said it would be difficult for malevolence\nitself to find anything to criticise in the choice of such a lover.\nThe King was highly amused with these plays, and was present at every\nperformance.  Caillot, a celebrated actor, who had long quitted the\nstage, and Dazincourt, both of acknowledged good character, were selected\nto give lessons, the first in comic opera, of which the easier sorts were\npreferred, and the second in comedy.  The office of hearer of rehearsals,\nprompter, and stage manager was given to my father-in-law.  The Duc de\nFronsac, first gentleman of the chamber, was much hurt at this.  He\nthought himself called upon to make serious remonstrances upon the\nsubject, and wrote to the Queen, who made him the following answer: “You\ncannot be first gentleman when we are the actors.  Besides, I have\nalready intimated to you my determination respecting Trianon.  I hold no\ncourt there, I live like a private person, and M. Campan shall be always\nemployed to execute orders relative to the private fetes I choose to give\nthere.”  This not putting a stop to the Duke’s remonstrances, the King\nwas obliged to interfere.  The Duke continued obstinate, and insisted\nthat he was entitled to manage the private amusements as much as those\nwhich were public.  It became absolutely necessary to end the argument in\na positive manner.",
        "The diminutive Duc de Fronsac never failed, when he came to pay his\nrespects to the Queen at her toilet, to turn the conversation upon\nTrianon, in order to make some ironical remarks on my father-in-law, of\nwhom, from the time of his appointment, he always spoke as “my colleague\nCampan.”  The Queen would shrug her shoulders, and say, when he was gone,\n\"It is quite shocking to find so little a man in the son of the Marechal\nde Richelieu.”",
        "So long as no strangers were admitted to the performances they were but\nlittle censured; but the praise obtained by the performers made them look\nfor a larger circle of admirers.  The company, for a private company, was\ngood enough, and the acting was applauded to the skies; nevertheless, as\nthe audience withdrew, adverse criticisms were occasionally heard.  The\nQueen permitted the officers of the Body Guards and the equerries of the\nKing and Princes to be present at the plays.  Private boxes were provided\nfor some of the people belonging to the Court; a few more ladies were\ninvited; and claims arose on all sides for the favour of admission.

        "While delight at having given an heir to the throne of the Bourbons, and\na succession of fetes and amusements, filled up the happy days of Marie\nAntoinette, the public was engrossed by the Anglo-American war.  Two\nkings, or rather their ministers, planted and propagated the love of\nliberty in the new world; the King of England, by shutting his ears and\nhis heart against the continued and respectful representations of\nsubjects at a distance from their native land, who had become numerous,\nrich, and powerful, through the resources of the soil they had\nfertilised; and the King of France, by giving support to this people in\nrebellion against their ancient sovereign.  Many young soldiers,\nbelonging to the first families of the country, followed La Fayette’s\nexample, and forsook luxury, amusement, and love, to go and tender their\naid to the revolted Americans.  Beaumarchais, secretly seconded by\nMessieurs de Maurepas and de Vergennes, obtained permission to send out\nsupplies of arms and clothing.  Franklin appeared at Court in the dress\nof an American agriculturist.  His unpowdered hair, his round hat, his\nbrown cloth coat formed a contrast to the laced and embroidered coats and\nthe powder and perfume of the courtiers of Versailles.  This novelty\nturned the light heads of the Frenchwomen.  Elegant entertainments were\ngiven to Doctor Franklin, who, to the reputation of a man of science,\nadded the patriotic virtues which invested him with the character of an\napostle of liberty.  I was present at one of these entertainments, when\nthe most beautiful woman out of three hundred was selected to place a\ncrown of laurels upon the white head of the American philosopher, and two\nkisses upon his cheeks.

The Queen spoke out more plainly\nabout the part France was taking respecting the independence of the\nAmerican colonies, and constantly opposed it.  Far was she from\nforeseeing that a revolution at–such a distance could excite one in\nwhich a misguided populace would drag her from her palace to a death\nequally unjust and cruel.  She only saw something ungenerous in the\nmethod which France adopted of checking the power of England.",
        "However, as Queen of France, she enjoyed the sight of a whole people\nrendering homage to the prudence, courage, and good qualities of a young\nFrenchman; and she shared the enthusiasm inspired by the conduct and\nmilitary success of the Marquis de La Fayette.  The Queen granted him\nseveral audiences on his first return from America, and, until the 10th\nof August, on which day my house was plundered, I preserved some lines\nfrom Gaston and Bayard, in which the friends of M. de La Fayette saw the\nexact outline of his character, written by her own hand:",

I obtained it for him.  On the Abbe’s\nreturn he told me very harshly that I should act in a manner quite\ncontrary to the King’s wishes if I again obtained such a favour; that the\nwealth of the Church was for the future to be invariably devoted to the\nsupport of the poorer nobility; that it was the interest of the State\nthat it should be so; and a plebeian priest, happy in a good curacy, had\nonly to remain curate.",

The Comtesse du Nord was not at first so successful with the Queen.\nThis lady was of a fine height, very fat for her age, with all the German\nstiffness, well informed, and perhaps displaying her acquirements with\nrather too much confidence.  When the Comte and Comtesse du Nord were\npresented the Queen was exceedingly nervous.  She withdrew into her\ncloset before she went into the room where she was to dine with the\nillustrious travellers, and asked for a glass of water, confessing “she\nhad just experienced how much more difficult it was to play the part of a\nqueen in the presence of other sovereigns, or of princes born to become\nso, than before courtiers.”  She soon recovered from her confusion, and\nreappeared with ease and confidence.  The dinner was tolerably cheerful,\nand the conversation very animated.",

They were received in private by the King\nand Queen, but they were treated with much more ceremony than the\nEmperor, and their Majesties always appeared to me to be very, cautious\nbefore these personages.  However, the King one day asked the Russian\nGrand Duke if it were true that he could not rely on the fidelity of any\none of those who accompanied him.  The Prince answered him without\nhesitation, and before a considerable number of persons, that he should\nbe very sorry to have with him even a poodle that was much attached to\nhim, because his mother would take care to have it thrown into the Seine,\nwith a stone round its neck, before he should leave Paris.  This reply,\nwhich I myself heard, horrified me, whether it depicted the disposition\nof Catherine, or only expressed the Prince’s prejudice against her.",
        "The Queen gave the Grand Duke a supper at Trianon, and had the gardens\nilluminated as they had been for the Emperor.  The Cardinal de Rohan very\nindiscreetly ventured to introduce himself there without the Queen’s\nknowledge.  Having been treated with the utmost coolness ever since his\nreturn from Vienna, he had not dared to ask her himself for permission to\nsee the illumination; but he persuaded the porter of Trianon to admit him\nas soon as the Queen should have set off for Versailles, and his Eminence\nengaged to remain in the porter’s lodge until all the carriages should\nhave left the chateau.  He did not keep his word, and while the porter\nwas busy in the discharge of his duty, the Cardinal, who wore his red\nstockings and had merely thrown on a greatcoat, went down into the\ngarden, and, with an air of mystery, drew up in two different places to\nsee the royal family and suite pass by.",
        "Her Majesty was highly offended at this piece of boldness, and next day\nordered the porter to be discharged.  There was a general feeling of\ndisgust at the Cardinal’s conduct, and of commiseration towards the\nporter for the loss of his place.  Affected at the misfortune of the\nfather of a family, I obtained his forgiveness; and since that time I\nhave often regretted the feeling which induced me to interfere.  The\nnotoriety of the discharge of the porter of Trianon, and the odium that\ncircumstance would have fixed upon the Cardinal, would have made the\nQueen’s dislike to him still more publicly known, and would probably have\nprevented the scandalous and notorious intrigue of the necklace.",

        "All that was said of the private character of that sovereign, his\nconnection with the Comte de Vergennes, from the time of the Revolution\nof Sweden, in 1772, the character of his favourite Armfeldt, and the\nprejudices of the monarch himself against the Swedes who were well\nreceived at the Court of Versailles, formed the grounds of this dislike.\nHe came one day uninvited and unexpected, and requested to dine with the\nQueen.  The Queen received him in the little closet, and desired me to\nsend for her clerk of the kitchen, that she might be informed whether\nthere was a proper dinner to set before Comte d’Haga, and add to it if\nnecessary.  The King of Sweden assured her that there would be enough for\nhim; and I could not help smiling when I thought of the length of the\nmenu of the dinner of the King and Queen, not half of which would have\nmade its appearance had they dined in private.  The Queen looked\nsignificantly at me, and I withdrew.  In the evening she asked me why I\nhad seemed so astonished when she ordered me to add to her dinner, saying\nthat I ought instantly to have seen that she was giving the King of\nSweden a lesson for his presumption.  I owned to her that the scene had\nappeared to me so much in the bourgeois style, that I involuntarily\nthought of the cutlets on the gridiron, and the omelette, which in\nfamilies in humble circumstances serve to piece out short commons.  She\nwas highly diverted with my answer, and repeated it to the King, who also\nlaughed heartily at it.",
        "The peace with England satisfied all classes of society interested in the\nnational honour.  The departure of the English commissary from Dunkirk,\nwho had been fixed at that place ever since the shameful peace of 1763 as\ninspector of our navy, occasioned an ecstasy of joy.",

This stipulation was\n     revoked by the Peace of Versailles, in 1783.–see DYER’S “Modern\n     Europe,” 1st edition, vol. i., pp.  205-438 and 539.]",
        "The Government communicated to the Englishman the order for his departure\nbefore the treaty was made public.  But for that precaution the populace\nwould have probably committed some excess or other, in order to make the\nagent of English power feel the effects of the resentment which had\nconstantly increased during his stay at that port.  Those engaged in\ntrade were the only persons dissatisfied with the treaty of 1783.  That\narticle which provided for, the free admission of English goods\nannihilated at one blow the trade of Rouen and the other manufacturing\ntowns throughout the kingdom.  The English swarmed into Paris.  A\nconsiderable number of them were presented at Court.  The Queen paid them\nmarked attention; doubtless she wished them to distinguish between the\nesteem she felt for their noble nation and the political views of the\nGovernment in the support it had afforded to the Americans.  Discontent\nwas, however, manifested at Court in consequence of the favour bestowed\nby the Queen on the English noblemen; these attentions were called\ninfatuations.  This was illiberal; and the Queen justly complained of\nsuch absurd jealousy.",
        "The journey to Fontainebleau and the winter at Paris and at Court were\nextremely brilliant.  The spring brought back those amusements which the\nQueen began to prefer to the splendour of fetes.  The most perfect\nharmony subsisted between the King and Queen; I never saw but one cloud\nbetween them.  It was soon dispelled, and the cause of it is perfectly\nunknown to me.",
        "My father-in-law, whose penetration and experience I respected greatly,\nrecommended me, when he saw me placed in the service of a young queen, to\nshun all kinds of confidence.  “It procures,” said he, “but a very\nfleeting, and at the same time dangerous sort of favour; serve with zeal\nto the best of your judgment, but never do more than obey.  Instead of\nsetting your wits to work to discover why an order or a commission which\nmay appear of consequence is given to you, use them to prevent the\npossibility of your knowing anything of the matter.”  I had occasion to\nact on this wise advice.  One morning at Trianon I went into the Queen’s\nchamber; there were letters lying upon the bed, and she was weeping\nbitterly.  Her tears and sobs were occasionally interrupted by\nexclamations of “Ah! that I were dead!–wretches! monsters! What have I\ndone to them?”  I offered her orange-flower water and ether.  “Leave me,\"\nsaid she, “if you love me; it would be better to kill me at once.”  At\nthis moment she threw her arm over my shoulder and began weeping afresh.\nI saw that some weighty trouble oppressed her heart, and that she wanted\na confidant.  I suggested sending for the Duchesse de Polignac; this she\nstrongly opposed.  I renewed my arguments, and her opposition grew\nweaker.  I disengaged myself from her arms, and ran to the antechamber,\nwhere I knew that an outrider always waited, ready to mount and start at\na moment’s warning for Versailles.  I ordered him to go full speed, and\ntell the Duchesse de Polignac that the Queen was very uneasy, and desired\nto see her instantly.  The Duchess always had a carriage ready.  In less\nthan ten minutes she was at the Queen’s door.  I was the only person\nthere, having been forbidden to send for the other women.  Madame de\nPolignac came in; the Queen held out her arms to her, the Duchess rushed\ntowards her.  I heard her sobs renewed and withdrew.",
        "A quarter of an hour afterwards the Queen, who had become calmer, rang to\nbe dressed.  I sent her woman in; she put on her gown and retired to her\nboudoir with the Duchess.  Very soon afterwards the Comte d’Artois\narrived from Compiegne, where he had been with the King.  He eagerly\ninquired where the Queen was; remained half an hour with her and the\nDuchess; and on coming out told me the Queen asked for me.  I found her\nseated on the couch by the side of her friend; her features had resumed\ntheir usual cheerful and gracious appearance.  She held out her hand to\nme, and said to the Duchess, “I know I have made her so uncomfortable\nthis morning that I must set her poor heart at ease.”  She then added,\n\"You must have seen, on some fine summer’s day, a black cloud suddenly\nappear and threaten to pour down upon the country and lay it waste.  The\nlightest wind drives it away, and the blue sky and serene weather are\nrestored.  This is just the image of what has happened to me this\nmorning.”  She afterwards told me that the King would return from\nCompiegne after hunting there, and sup with her; that I must send for her\npurveyor, to select with him from his bills of fare all such dishes as\nthe King liked best; that she would have no others served up in the\nevening at her table; and that this was a mark of attention that she\nwished the King to notice.  The Duchesse de Polignac also took me by the\nhand, and told me how happy she was that she had been with the Queen at a\nmoment when she stood in need of a friend.  I never knew what could have\ncreated in the Queen so lively and so transient an alarm; but I guessed\nfrom the particular care she took respecting the King that attempts had\nbeen made to irritate him against her; that the malice of her enemies had\nbeen promptly discovered and counteracted by the King’s penetration and\nattachment; and that the Comte d’Artois had hastened to bring her\nintelligence of it.",
        "It was, I think, in the summer of 1787, during one of the Trianon\nexcursions, that the Queen of Naples–[Caroline, sister of Marie\nAntoinette.]–sent the Chevalier de Bressac to her Majesty on a secret\nmission relative to a projected marriage between the Hereditary Prince,\nher son, and Madame, the King’s daughter; in the absence of the lady of\nhonour he addressed himself to me.  Although he said a great deal to me\nabout the close confidence with which the Queen of Naples honoured him,\nand about his letter of credit, I thought he had the air of an\nadventurer.–[He afterwards spent several years shut up in the Chateau de\nl’Oeuf.]–He had, indeed, private letters for the Queen, and his\nmission was not feigned; he talked to me very rashly even before his\nadmission, and entreated me to do all that lay in my power to dispose the\nQueen’s mind in favour of his sovereign’s wishes; I declined, assuring\nhim that it did not become me to meddle with State affairs.\nHe endeavoured, but in vain, to prove to me that the union contemplated\nby the Queen of Naples ought not to be looked upon in that light.",
        "I procured M. de Bressac the audience he desired, but without suffering\nmyself even to seem acquainted with the object of his mission.  The Queen\ntold me what it was; she thought him a person ill-chosen for the\noccasion; and yet she thought that the Queen, her sister, had done wisely\nin not sending a man worthy to be avowed,–it being impossible that what\nshe solicited should take place.  I had an opportunity on this occasion,\nas indeed on many others, of judging to what extent the Queen valued and\nloved France and the dignity of our Court.  She then told me that Madame,\nin marrying her cousin, the Duc d’Angouleme, would not lose her rank as\ndaughter of the Queen; and that her situation would be far preferable to\nthat of queen of any other country; and that there was nothing in Europe\nto be compared to the Court of France; and that it would be necessary,\nin order to avoid exposing a French Princess to feelings of deep regret,\nin case she should be married to a foreign prince, to take her from the\npalace of Versailles at seven years of age, and send her immediately to\nthe Court in which she was to dwell; and that at twelve would be too\nlate; for recollections and comparisons would ruin the happiness of all\nthe rest of her life.  The Queen looked upon the destiny of her sisters\nas far beneath her own; and frequently mentioned the mortifications\ninflicted by the Court of Spain upon her sister, the Queen of Naples, and\nthe necessity she was under of imploring the mediation of the King of\nFrance.",
        "She showed me several letters that she had received from the Queen of\nNaples relative to her differences with the Court of Madrid respecting\nthe Minister Acton.  She thought him useful to her people, inasmuch as he\nwas a man of considerable information and great activity.  In these\nletters she minutely acquainted her Majesty with the nature of the\naffronts she had received, and represented Mr. Acton to her as a man whom\nmalevolence itself could not suppose capable of interesting her otherwise\nthan by his services.  She had had to suffer the impertinences of a\nSpaniard named Las Casas, who had been sent to her by the King, her\nfather-in-law, to persuade her to dismiss Mr. Acton from the business of\nthe State, and from her intimacy.  She complained bitterly to the Queen,\nher sister, of the insulting proceedings of this charge d’affaires, whom\nshe told, in order to convince him of the nature of the feelings which\nattached her to Mr. Acton, that she would have portraits and busts of him\nexecuted by the most eminent artists of Italy, and that she would then\nsend them to the King of Spain, to prove that nothing but the desire to\nretain a man of superior capacity had induced her to bestow on him the\nfavour he enjoyed.  This Las Casas dared to answer her that it would be\nuseless trouble; that the ugliness of a man did not always render him\ndispleasing; and that the King of Spain had too much experience not to\nknow that there was no accounting for the caprices of a woman.",
        "This audacious reply filled the Queen of Naples with indignation, and her\nemotion caused her to miscarry on the same day.  In consequence of the\nmediation of Louis XVI. the Queen of Naples obtained complete\nsatisfaction, and Mr. Acton continued Prime Minister.",
        "Among the characteristics which denoted the goodness of the Queen, her\nrespect for personal liberty should have a place.  I have seen her put up\nwith the most troublesome importunities from people whose minds were\nderanged rather than have them arrested.  Her patient kindness was put to\na very disagreeable trial by an ex-councillor of the Bordeaux Parliament,\nnamed Castelnaux; this man declared himself the lover of the Queen, and\nwas generally known by that appellation.  For ten successive years did he\nfollow the Court in all its excursions.  Pale and wan, as people who are\nout of their senses usually are, his sinister appearance occasioned the\nmost uncomfortable sensations.  During the two hours that the Queen’s\npublic card parties lasted, he would remain opposite her Majesty.  He\nplaced himself in the same manner before her at chapel, and never failed\nto be at the King’s dinner or the dinner in public.  At the theatre he\ninvariably seated himself as near the Queen’s box as possible.  He always\nset off for Fontainebleau or St. Cloud the day before the Court, and when\nher Majesty arrived at her various residences, the first person she met\non getting out of her carriage was this melancholy madman, who never\nspoke to any one.  When the Queen stayed at Petit Trianon the passion of\nthis unhappy man became still more annoying.  He would hastily swallow a\nmorsel at some eating-house, and spend all the rest of the day, even when\nit rained, in going round and round the garden, always walking at the\nedge of the moat.  The Queen frequently met him when she was either alone\nor with her children; and yet she would not suffer any violence to be\nused to relieve her from this intolerable annoyance.  Having one day\ngiven M. de Seze permission to enter Trianon, she sent to desire he would\ncome to me, and directed me to inform that celebrated advocate of M. de\nCastelnaux’s derangement, and then to send for him that M. de Seze might\nhave some conversation with him.  He talked to him nearly an hour, and\nmade considerable impression upon his mind; and at last M. de Castelnaux\nrequested me to inform the Queen positively that, since his presence was\ndisagreeable to her, he would retire to his province.  The Queen was very\nmuch rejoiced, and desired me to express her full satisfaction to M. de\nSeze.  Half an hour after M. de Seze was gone the unhappy madman was\nannounced.  He came to tell me that he withdrew his promise, that he had\nnot sufficient command of himself to give up seeing the Queen as often as\npossible.  This new determination: was a disagreeable message to take to\nher Majesty but how was I affected at hearing her say, “Well, let him\nannoy me!  but do not let him be deprived of the blessing of freedom.”",
        "     [On the arrest of the King and Queen at Varennes, this unfortunate\n     Castelnaux attempted to starve himself to death.  The people in\n     whose house he lived, becoming uneasy at his absence, had the door\n     of his room forced open, when he was found stretched senseless on\n     the floor.  I do not know what became of him after the 10th of\n     August.–MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "The direct influence of the Queen on affairs during the earlier years\nof the reign was shown only in her exertions to obtain from the King a\nrevision of the decrees in two celebrated causes.  It was contrary to her\nprinciples to interfere in matters of justice, and never did she avail\nherself of her influence to bias the tribunals.  The Duchesse de Praslin,\nthrough a criminal caprice, carried her enmity to her husband so far as\nto disinherit her children in favour of the family of M. de Guemenee.\nThe Duchesse de Choiseul, who, was warmly interested in this affair, one\nday entreated the Queen, in my presence, at least to condescend to ask\nthe first president when the cause would be called on; the Queen replied\nthat she could not even do that, for it would manifest an interest which\nit was her duty not to show.",
        "If the King had not inspired the Queen with a lively feeling of love,\nit is quite certain that she yielded him respect and affection for the\ngoodness of his disposition and the equity of which he gave so many\nproofs throughout his reign.  One evening she returned very late; she\ncame out of the King’s closet, and said to M. de Misery and myself,\ndrying her eyes, which were filled with tears, “You see me weeping, but\ndo not be uneasy at it: these are the sweetest tears that a wife can\nshed; they are caused by the impression which the justice and goodness of\nthe King have made upon me; he has just complied with my request for a\nrevision of the proceedings against Messieurs de Bellegarde and de\nMonthieu, victims of the Duc d’Aiguillon’s hatred to the Duc de Choiseul.\nHe has been equally just to the Duc de Guines in his affair with Tort.\nIt is a happy thing for a queen to be able to admire and esteem him who\nhas admitted her to a participation of his throne; and as to you,\nI congratulate you upon your having to live under the sceptre of so\nvirtuous a sovereign.”",
        "The Queen laid before the King all the memorials of the Duc de Guines,\nwho, during his embassy to England, was involved in difficulties by a\nsecretary, who speculated in the public funds in London on his own\naccount, but in such a manner as to throw a suspicion of it on the\nambassador.  Messieurs de Vergennes and Turgot, bearing but little good-\nwill to the Duc de Guines, who was the friend of the Duc de Choiseul,\nwere not disposed to render the ambassador any service.  The Queen\nsucceeded in fixing the King’s particular attention on this affair, and\nthe innocence of the Duc de Guines triumphed through the equity of Louis\nXVI.",
        "An incessant underhand war was carried on between the friends and\npartisans of M. de Choiseul, who were called the Austrians, and those who\nsided with Messieurs d’Aiguillon, de Maurepas, and de Vergennes, who, for\nthe same reason, kept up the intrigues carried on at Court and in Paris\nagainst the Queen.  Marie Antoinette, on her part, supported those who\nhad suffered in this political quarrel, and it was this feeling which led\nher to ask for a revision of the proceedings against Messieurs de\nBellegarde and de Monthieu.  The first, a colonel and inspector of\nartillery, and the second, proprietor of a foundry at St. Etienne, were,\nunder the Ministry of the Duc d’Aiguillon, condemned to imprisonment for\ntwenty years and a day for having withdrawn from the arsenals of France,\nby order of the Duc de Choiseul, a vast number of muskets, as being of\nno value except as old iron, while in point of fact the greater part of\nthose muskets were immediately embarked and sold to the Americans.  It\nappears that the Duc de Choiseul imparted to the Queen, as grounds of\ndefence for the accused, the political views which led him to authorise\nthat reduction and sale in the manner in which it had been executed.  It\nrendered the case of Messieurs de Bellegarde and de Monthieu more\nunfavourable that the artillery officer who made the reduction in the\ncapacity of inspector was, through a clandestine marriage, brother-in-law\nof the owner of the foundry, the purchaser of the rejected arms.  The\ninnocence of the two prisoners was, nevertheless, made apparent; and they\ncame to Versailles with their wives and children to throw themselves at\nthe feet of their benefactress.  This affecting scene took place in the\ngrand gallery, at the entrance to the Queen’s apartment.  She wished to\nrestrain the women from kneeling, saying that they had only had justice\ndone them; and that she ought to be congratulated upon the most\nsubstantial happiness attendant upon her station, that of laying just\nappeals before the King.",
        "On every occasion, when the Queen had to speak in public, she used the\nmost appropriate and elegant language, notwithstanding the difficulty a\nforeigner might be expected to experience.  She answered all addresses\nherself, a custom which she learned at the Court of Maria Theresa.  The\nPrincesses of the House of Bourbon had long ceased to take the trouble of\nspeaking in such cases.  Madame Addlaide blamed the Queen for not doing\nas they did, assuring her that it was quite sufficient to mutter a few\nwords that might sound like an answer, while the addressers, occupied\nwith what they had themselves been saying, would always take it for\ngranted that a proper answer had been returned.  The Queen saw that\nidleness alone dictated such a proceeding, and that as the practice even\nof muttering a few words showed the necessity of answering in some way,\nit must be more proper to reply simply but clearly, and in the best style\npossible.  Sometimes indeed, when apprised of the subject of the address,\nshe would write down her answer in the morning, not to learn it by heart,\nbut in order to settle the ideas or sentiments she wished to introduce.",
        "The influence of the Comtesse de Polignac increased daily; and her\nfriends availed themselves of it to effect changes in the Ministry.\nThe dismissal of M. de Montbarrey, a man without talents or character,\nwas generally approved of.  It was rightly attributed to the Queen.  He\nhad been placed in administration by M. de Maurepas, and maintained by\nhis aged wife; both, of course, became more inveterate than ever against\nthe Queen and the Polignac circle.",
        "The appointment of M. de Segur to the place of Minister of War, and of\nM. de Castries to that of Minister of Marine, were wholly the work of\nthat circle.  The Queen dreaded making ministers; her favourite often\nwept when the men of her circle compelled her to interfere.  Men blame\nwomen for meddling in business, and yet in courts it is continually the\nmen themselves who make use of the influence of the women in matters with\nwhich the latter ought to have nothing to do.",
        "When M. de Segur was presented to the Queen on his new appointment, she\nsaid to me, “You have just seen a minister of my making.  I am very glad,\nso far as regards the King’s service, that he is appointed, for I think\nthe selection a very good one; but I almost regret the part I have taken\nin it.  I take a responsibility upon myself.  I was fortunate in being\nfree from any; and in order to relieve myself from this as much as\npossible I have just promised M. de Segur, and that upon my word of\nhonour, not to back any petition, nor to hinder any of his operations by\nsolicitations on behalf of my proteges.”",
        "During the first administration of M. Necker, whose ambition had not then\ndrawn him into schemes repugnant to his better judgment, and whose views\nappeared to the Queen to be very judicious, she indulged in hopes of the\nrestoration of the finances.  Knowing that M. de Maurepas wished to drive\nM. Necker to resign, she urged him to have patience until the death of an\nold man whom the King kept about him from a fondness for his first\nchoice, and out of respect for his advanced age.  She even went so far as\nto tell him that M. de Maurepas was always ill, and that his end could\nnot be very distant.  M. Necker would not wait for that event.  The\nQueen’s prediction was fulfilled.  M. de Maurepas ended his days\nimmediately after a journey to Fontainebleau in 1781.",
        "M. Necker had retired.  He had been exasperated by a piece of treachery\nin the old minister, for which he could not forgive him.  I knew\nsomething of this intrigue at the time; it has since been fully explained\nto me by Madame la Marechale de Beauvau.  M. Necker saw that his credit\nat Court was declining, and fearing lest that circumstance should injure\nhis financial operations, he requested the King to grant him some favour\nwhich might show the public that he had not lost the confidence of his\nsovereign.  He concluded his letter by pointing out five requests–such\nan office, or such a mark of distinction, or such a badge of honour, and\nso on, and handed it to M. de Maurepas.  The or’s were changed into\nand’s; and the King was displeased at M. Necker’s ambition, and the\nassurance with which he displayed it.  Madame la Marechale de Beauvau\nassured me that the Marechal de Castries saw the minute of M. Necker’s\nletter, and that he likewise saw the altered copy.",
        "The interest which the Queen took in M. Necker died away during his\nretirement, and at last changed into strong prejudice against him.  He\nwrote too much about the measures he would have pursued, and the benefits\nthat would have resulted to the State from them.  The ministers who\nsucceeded him thought their operations embarrassed by the care that M.\nNecker and his partisans incessantly took to occupy the public with his\nplans; his friends were too ardent.  The Queen discerned a party spirit\nin these combinations, and sided wholly with his enemies.",
        "After those inefficient comptrollers-general, Messieurs Joly de Fleury\nand d’Ormesson, it became necessary to resort to a man of more\nacknowledged talent, and the Queen’s friends, at that time combining with\nthe Comte d’Artois and with M. de Vergennes, got M. de Calonne appointed.\nThe Queen was highly displeased, and her close intimacy with the Duchesse\nde Polignac began to suffer for this.",
        "Her Majesty, continuing to converse with me upon the difficulties she\nhad met with in private life, told me that ambitious men without merit\nsometimes found means to gain their ends by dint of importunity, and that\nshe had to blame herself for having procured M. d’Adhemar’s appointment\nto the London embassy, merely because he teased her into it at the\nDuchess’s house.  She added, however, that it was at a time of perfect\npeace with the English; that the Ministry knew the inefficiency of\nM. d’Adhemar as well as she did, and that he could do neither harm nor\ngood.",
        "Often in conversations of unreserved frankness the Queen owned that she\nhad purchased rather dearly a piece of experience which would make her\ncarefully watch over the conduct of her daughters-in-law, and that she\nwould be particularly scrupulous about the qualifications of the ladies\nwho might attend them; that no consideration of rank or favour should\nbias her in so important a choice.  She attributed several of her\nyouthful mistakes to a lady of great levity, whom she found in her palace\non her arrival in France.  She also determined to forbid the Princesses\ncoming under her control the practice of singing with professors, and\nsaid, candidly, and with as much severity as her slanderers could have\ndone, “I ought to have heard Garat sing, and never to have sung duets\nwith him.”",
        "The indiscreet zeal of Monsieur Augeard contributed to the public belief\nthat the Queen disposed of all the offices of finance.  He had, without\nany authority for doing so, required the committee of fermiers-general to\ninform him of all vacancies, assuring them that they would be meeting the\nwishes of the Queen.  The members complied, but not without murmuring.\nWhen the Queen became aware of what her secretary had done, she highly\ndisapproved of it, caused her resentment to be made known to the fermiers\n-general, and abstained from asking for appointments,–making only one\nrequest of the kind, as a marriage portion for one of her attendants, a\nyoung woman of good family.",
        "The Queen did not sufficiently conceal the dissatisfaction she felt at\nhaving been unable to prevent the appointment of M. de Calonne; she even\none day went so far as to say at the Duchess’s, in the midst of the\npartisans and protectors of that minister, that the finances of France\npassed alternately from the hands of an honest man without talent into\nthose of a skilful knave.  M. de Calonne was thus far from acting in\nconcert with the Queen all the time that he continued in office; and,\nwhile dull verses were circulated about Paris describing the Queen and\nher favourite dipping at pleasure into the coffers of the comptroller-\ngeneral, the Queen was avoiding all communication with him.",
        "During the long and severe winter of 1783-84 the King gave three millions\nof livres for the relief of the indigent.  M. de Calonne, who felt the\nnecessity of making advances to the Queen, caught at this opportunity of\nshowing her respect and devotion.  He offered to place in her hands one\nmillion of the three, to be distributed in her name and under her\ndirection.  His proposal was rejected; the Queen answered that the\ncharity ought to be wholly distributed in the King’s name, and that she\nwould this year debar herself of even the slightest enjoyments, in order\nto contribute all her savings to the relief of the unfortunate.",
        "The moment M. de Calonne left the closet the Queen sent for me:\n\"Congratulate me, my dear,” said she; “I have just escaped a snare,\nor at least a matter which eventually might have caused me much regret.\"\nShe related the conversation which had taken place word for word to me,\nadding, “That man will complete the ruin of the national finances.  It is\nsaid that I placed him in his situation.  The people are made to believe\nthat I am extravagant; yet I have refused to suffer a sum of money from\nthe royal treasury, although destined for the most laudable purpose, even\nto pass through my hands.”",
        "The Queen, making monthly retrenchments from the expenditure of her privy\npurse, and not having spent the gifts customary at the period of her\nconfinement, was in possession of from five to six hundred thousand\nfrancs, her own savings.  She made use of from two to three hundred\nthousand francs of this, which her first women sent to M. Lenoir, to the\ncures of Paris and Versailles, and to the Soeurs Hospitalieres, and so\ndistributed them among families in need.",
        "Desirous to implant in the breast of her daughter not only a desire to\nsuccour the unfortunate, but those qualities necessary for the due\ndischarge of that duty, the Queen incessantly talked to her, though she\nwas yet very young, about the sufferings of the poor during a season so\ninclement.  The Princess already had a sum of from eight to ten thousand\nfrancs for charitable purposes, and the Queen made her distribute part of\nit herself.",
        "Wishing to give her children yet another lesson of beneficence,\nshe desired me on New Year’s eve to get from Paris, as in other years,\nall the fashionable playthings, and have them spread out in her closet.\nThen taking her children by the hand, she showed them all the dolls and\nmechanical toys which were ranged there, and told them that she had\nintended to give them some handsome New Year’s gifts, but that the cold\nmade the poor so wretched that all her money was spent in blankets and\nclothes to protect them from the rigour of the season, and in supplying\nthem with bread; so that this year they would only have the pleasure of\nlooking at the new playthings.  When she returned with her children into\nher sitting-room, she said there was still an unavoidable expense to be\nincurred; that assuredly many mothers would at that season think as she\ndid,–that the toyman must lose by it; and therefore she gave him fifty\nLouis to repay him for the cost of his journey, and console him for\nhaving sold nothing.",
        "The purchase of St. Cloud, a matter very simple in itself, had, on\naccount of the prevailing spirit, unfavourable consequences to the Queen.",
        "The palace of Versailles, pulled to pieces in the interior by a variety\nof new arrangements, and mutilated in point of uniformity by the removal\nof the ambassadors’ staircase, and of the peristyle of columns placed at\nthe end of the marble court, was equally in want of substantial and\nornamental repair.  The King therefore desired M. Micque to lay before\nhim several plans for the repairs of the palace.  He consulted me on\ncertain arrangements analogous to some of those adopted in the Queen’s\nestablishment, and in my presence asked M. Micque how much money would be\nwanted for the execution of the whole work, and how many years he would\nbe in completing it.  I forget how many millions were mentioned: M.\nMicque replied that six years would be sufficient time if the Treasury\nmade the necessary periodical advances without any delay.  “And how many\nyears shall you require,” said the King, “if the advances are not\npunctually made?\"–\"Ten, Sire,” replied the architect.  “We must then\nreckon upon ten years,” said his Majesty, “and put off this great\nundertaking until the year 1790; it will occupy the rest of the century.”",
        "The King afterwards talked of the depreciation of property which took\nplace at Versailles whilst the Regent removed the Court of Louis XV. to\nthe Tuileries, and said that he must consider how to prevent that\ninconvenience; it was the desire to do this that promoted the purchase of\nSt. Cloud.  The Queen first thought of it one day when she was riding out\nwith the Duchesse de Polignac and the Comtesse Diane; she mentioned it to\nthe King, who was much pleased with the thought,–the purchase confirming\nhim in the intention, which he had entertained for ten years, of quitting\nVersailles.",
        "The King determined that the ministers, public officers, pages, and a\nconsiderable part of his stabling should remain at Versailles.  Messieurs\nde Breteuil and de Calonne were instructed to treat with the Duc\nd’Orleans for the purchase of St. Cloud; at first they hoped to be able\nto conclude the business by a mere exchange.  The value of the Chateau de\nChoisy, de la Muette, and a forest was equivalent to the sum demanded by\nthe House of Orleans; and in the exchange which the Queen expected she\nonly saw a saving to be made instead of an increase of expense.  By this\narrangement the government of Choisy, in the hands of the Duc de Coigny,\nand that of La Muette, in the hands of the Marechal de Soubise, would be\nsuppressed.  At the same time the two concierges, and all the servants\nemployed in these two royal houses, would be reduced; but while the\ntreaty was going forward Messieurs de Breteuil and de Calonne gave up the\npoint of exchange, and some millions in cash were substituted for Choisy\nand La Muette.",
        "The Queen advised the King to give her St. Cloud, as a means of avoiding\nthe establishment of a governor; her plan being to have merely a\nconcierge there, by which means the governor’s expenses would be saved.\nThe King agreed, and St. Cloud was purchased for the Queen.  She provided\nthe same liveries for the porters at the gates and servants at the\nchateau as for those at Trianon.  The concierge at the latter place had\nput up some regulations for the household, headed, “By order of the\nQueen.”  The same thing was done at St. Cloud.  The Queen’s livery at the\ndoor of a palace where it was expected none but that of the King would be\nseen, and the words “By order of the Queen” at the head of the printed\npapers pasted near the iron gates, caused a great sensation, and produced\na very unfortunate effect, not only among the common people, but also.\namong persons of a superior class.  They saw in it an attack upon the\ncustoms of monarchy, and customs are nearly equal to laws.  The Queen\nheard of this, but she thought that her dignity would be compromised if\nshe made any change in the form of these regulations, though they might\nhave been altogether superseded without inconvenience.  “My name is not\nout of place,” said she, “in gardens belonging to myself; I may give\norders there without infringing on the rights of the State.”  This was\nher only answer to the representations which a few faithful servants\nventured to make on the subject.  The discontent of the Parisians on this\noccasion probably induced M. d’Espremenil, upon the first troubles about\nthe Parliament, to say that it was impolitic and immoral to see palaces\nbelonging to a Queen of France.",
        "     [The Queen never forgot this affront of M. d’Espremenil’s; she said\n     that as it was offered at a time when social order had not yet been\n     disturbed, she had felt the severest mortification at it.  Shortly\n     before the downfall of the throne M. Espremenil, having openly\n     espoused the King’s side, was insulted in the gardens of the\n     Tuileries by the Jacobins, and so ill-treated that he was carried\n     home very ill.  Somebody recommended the Queen, on account of the\n     royalist principles he then professed, to send and inquire for him.\n     She replied that she was truly grieved at what had happened to M.\n     d’Espremenil, but that mere policy should never induce her to show\n     any particular solicitude about the man who had been the first to\n     make so insulting an attack upon her character.–MADAME CAMPAN]",
        "The Queen was very much dissatisfied with the manner in which M. de\nCalonne had managed this matter.  The Abbe de Vermond, the most active\nand persevering of that minister’s enemies, saw with delight that the\nexpedients of those from whom alone new resources might be expected were\ngradually becoming exhausted, because the period when the Archbishop of\nToulouse would be placed over the finances was thereby hastened.",
        "The royal navy had resumed an imposing attitude during the war for the\nindependence of America; glorious peace with England had compensated for\nthe former attacks of our enemies upon the fame of France; and the throne\nwas surrounded by numerous heirs.  The sole ground of uneasiness was in\nthe finances, but that uneasiness related only to the manner in which\nthey were administered.  In a word, France felt confident in its own\nstrength and resources, when two events, which seem scarcely worthy of a\nplace in history, but which have, nevertheless, an important one in that\nof the French Revolution, introduced a spirit of ridicule and contempt,\nnot only against the highest ranks, but even against the most august\npersonages.  I allude to a comedy and a great swindling transaction.",
        "Beaumarchais had long possessed a reputation in certain circles in Paris\nfor his wit and musical talents, and at the theatres for dramas more or\nless indifferent, when his “Barbier de Seville” procured him a higher\nposition among dramatic writers.  His “Memoirs” against M. Goesman had\namused Paris by the ridicule they threw upon a Parliament which was\ndisliked; and his admission to an intimacy with M. de Maurepas procured\nhim a degree of influence over important affairs.  He then became\nambitious of influencing public opinion by a kind of drama, in which\nestablished manners and customs should be held up to popular derision and\nthe ridicule of the new philosophers.  After several years of prosperity\nthe minds of the French had become more generally critical; and when\nBeaumarchais had finished his monstrous but diverting “Mariage de\nFigaro,” all people of any consequence were eager for the gratification\nof hearing it read, the censors having decided that it should not be\nperformed.  These readings of “Figaro” grew so numerous that people were\ndaily heard to say, “I have been (or I am going to be) at the reading of\nBeaumarchais’s play.”  The desire to see it performed became universal;\nan expression that he had the art to use compelled, as it were, the\napprobation of the nobility, or of persons in power, who aimed at ranking\namong the magnanimous; he made his “Figaro” say that “none but little\nminds dreaded little books.”  The Baron de Breteuil, and all the men of\nMadame de Polignac’s circle, entered the lists as the warmest protectors\nof the comedy.  Solicitations to the King became so pressing that his\nMajesty determined to judge for himself of a work which so much engrossed\npublic attention, and desired me to ask M. Le Noir, lieutenant of police,\nfor the manuscript of the “Mariage de Figaro.”  One morning I received a\nnote from the Queen ordering me to be with her at three o’clock, and not\nto come without having dined, for she should detain me some time.  When I\ngot to the Queen’s inner closet I found her alone with the King; a chair\nand a small table were ready placed opposite to them, and upon the\ntable lay an enormous manuscript in several books.  The King said to me,\n\"There is Beaumarchais’s comedy; you must read it to us.  You will find\nseveral parts troublesome on account of the erasures and references.  I\nhave already run it over, but I wish the Queen to be acquainted with the\nwork.  You will not mention this reading to any one.”",
        "I began.  The King frequently interrupted me by praise or censure, which\nwas always just.  He frequently exclaimed, “That’s in bad taste; this man\ncontinually brings the Italian concetti on the stage.”  At that soliloquy\nof Figaro in which he attacks various points of government, and\nespecially at the tirade against State prisons, the King rose up and\nsaid, indignantly:",
        "“That’s detestable; that shall never be played; the Bastille must be\ndestroyed before the license to act this play can be any other than an\nact of the most dangerous inconsistency.  This man scoffs at everything\nthat should be respected in a government.”",
        "“It will not be played, then?”  said the Queen.",
        "“No, certainly,” replied Louis XVI.; “you may rely upon that.”",
        "Still it was constantly reported that “Figaro” was about to be performed;\nthere were even wagers laid upon the subject; I never should have laid\nany myself, fancying that I was better informed as to the probability\nthan anybody else; if I had, however, I should have been completely\ndeceived.  The protectors of Beaumarchais, feeling certain that they\nwould succeed in their scheme of making his work public in spite of the\nKing’s prohibition, distributed the parts in the “Mariage de Figaro\"\namong the actors of the Theatre Francais.  Beaumarchais had made them\nenter into the spirit of his characters, and they determined to enjoy at\nleast one performance of this so-called chef d’oeuvre.  The first\ngentlemen of the chamber agreed that M. de la Ferte should lend the\ntheatre of the Hotel des Menus Plaisirs, at Paris, which was used for\nrehearsals of the opera; tickets were distributed to a vast number of\nleaders of society, and the day for the performance was fixed.  The King\nheard of all this only on the very morning, and signed a ’lettre de\ncachet,’–[A ’lettre de cachet’ was any written order proceeding from the\nKing.  The term was not confined merely to orders for arrest.]–which\nprohibited the performance.  When the messenger who brought the order\narrived, he found a part of the theatre already filled with spectators,\nand the streets leading to the Hotel des Menus Plaisirs filled with\ncarriages; the piece was not performed.  This prohibition of the King’s\nwas looked upon as an attack on public liberty.",
        "The disappointment produced such discontent that the words oppression and\ntyranny were uttered with no less passion and bitterness at that time\nthan during the days which immediately preceded the downfall of the\nthrone.  Beaumarchais was so far put off his guard by rage as to exclaim,\n\"Well, gentlemen, he won’t suffer it to be played here; but I swear it\nshall be played,–perhaps in the very choir of Notre-Dame!”  There was\nsomething prophetic in these words.  It was generally insinuated shortly\nafterwards that Beaumarchais had determined to suppress all those parts\nof his work which could be obnoxious to the Government; and on pretence\nof judging of the sacrifices made by the author, M. de Vaudreuil obtained\npermission to have this far-famed “Mariage de Figaro” performed at his\ncountry house.  M. Campan was asked there; he had frequently heard the\nwork read, and did not now find the alterations that had been announced;\nthis he observed to several persons belonging to the Court, who\nmaintained that the author had made all the sacrifices required.  M.\nCampan was so astonished at these persistent assertions of an obvious\nfalsehood that he replied by a quotation from Beaumarchais himself, and\nassuming the tone of Basilio in the “Barbier de Seville,” he said,\n\"Faith, gentlemen, I don’t know who is deceived here; everybody is in the\nsecret.”  They then came to the point, and begged him to tell the Queen\npositively that all which had been pronounced reprehensible in M. de\nBeaumarchais’s play had been cut out.  My father-in-law contented himself\nwith replying that his situation at Court would not allow of his giving\nan opinion unless the Queen should first speak of the piece to him.\nThe Queen said nothing to him about the matter.  Shortly, afterwards\npermission to perform this play was at length obtained.  The Queen\nthought the people of Paris would be finely tricked when they saw merely\nan ill-conceived piece, devoid of interest, as it must appear when\ndeprived of its Satire.",
        "     [\"The King,” says Grimm, “made sure that the public would judge\n     unfavourably of the work.”  He said to the Marquis de Montesquiou,\n     who was going to see the first representation, ’Well, what do you\n     augur of its success?’–’Sire, I hope the piece will fail.’–’And so\n     do I,’ replied the King.",
        "     “There is something still more ridiculous than my piece,” said\n     Beaumarchais himself; “that is, its success.”  Mademoiselle Arnould\n     foresaw it the first day, and exclaimed, “It is a production that\n     will fail fifty nights successively.”  There was as crowded an\n     audience on the seventy-second night as on the first.  The following\n     is extracted from Grimm’s ’Correspondence.’",
        "     “Answer of M. de Beaumarchais to ––-, who requested the use of his\n     private box for some ladies desirous of seeing ’Figaro’ without\n     being themselves seen.",
        "     “I have no respect for women who indulge themselves in seeing any\n     play which they think indecorous, provided they can do so in secret.\n     I lend myself to no such acts.  I have given my piece to the public,\n     to amuse, and not to instruct, not to give any compounding prudes\n     the pleasure of going to admire it in a private box, and balancing\n     their account with conscience by censuring it in company.  To\n     indulge in the pleasure of vice and assume the credit of virtue is\n     the hypocrisy of the age.  My piece is not of a doubtful nature; it\n     must be patronised in good earnest, or avoided altogether;\n     therefore, with all respect to you, I shall keep my box.”  This\n     letter was circulated all over Paris for a week.]",
        "Under the persuasion that there was not a passage left capable of\nmalicious or dangerous application, Monsieur attended the first\nperformance in a public box.  The mad enthusiasm of the public in favour\nof the piece and Monsieur’s just displeasure are well known.  The author\nwas sent to prison soon afterwards, though his work was extolled to the\nskies, and though the Court durst not suspend its performance.",
        "The Queen testified her displeasure against all who had assisted the\nauthor of the “Mariage de Figaro” to deceive the King into giving his\nconsent that it should be represented.  Her reproaches were more\nparticularly directed against M. de Vaudreuil for having had it performed\nat his house.  The violent and domineering disposition of her favourite’s\nfriend at last became disagreeable to her.",
        "One evening, on the Queen’s return from the Duchess’s, she desired her\n’valet de chambre’ to bring her billiard cue into her closet, and ordered\nme to open the box that contained it.  I took out the cue, broken in two.\nIt was of ivory, and formed of one single elephant’s tooth; the butt was\nof gold and very tastefully wrought.  “There,” said she, “that is the way\nM. de Vaudreuil has treated a thing I valued highly.  I had laid it upon\nthe couch while I was talking to the Duchess in the salon; he had the\nassurance to make use of it, and in a fit of passion about a blocked\nball, he struck the cue so violently against the table that he broke it\nin two.  The noise brought me back into the billiard-room; I did not say\na word to him, but my looks showed him how angry I was.  He is the more\nprovoked at the accident, as he aspires to the post of Governor to the\nDauphin.  I never thought of him for the place.  It is quite enough to\nhave consulted my heart only in the choice of a governess; and I will not\nsuffer that of a Governor to the Dauphin to be at all affected by the\ninfluence of my friends.  I should be responsible for it to the nation.\nThe poor man does not know that my determination is taken; for I have\nnever expressed it to the Duchess.  Therefore, judge of the sort of an\nevening he must have passed!”",
        "Shortly after the public mind had been thrown into agitation by the\nperformance of the “Mariage de Figaro,” an obscure plot, contrived by\nswindlers, and matured in a corrupted society, attacked the Queen’s\ncharacter in a vital point and assailed the majesty of the throne.",
        "I am about to speak of the notorious affair of the necklace purchased, as\nit was said, for the Queen by Cardinal de Rohan.  I will narrate all that\nhas come to my knowledge relating to this business; the most minute\nparticulars will prove how little reason the Queen had to apprehend the\nblow by which she was threatened, and which must be attributed to a\nfatality that human prudence could not have foreseen, but from which, to\nsay the truth, she might have extricated herself with more skill.",
        "I have already said that in 1774 the Queen purchased jewels of Boehmer to\nthe value of three hundred and sixty thousand franca, that she paid for\nthem herself out of her own private funds, and that it required several\nyears to enable her to complete the payment.  The King afterwards\npresented her with a set of rubies and diamonds of a fine water, and\nsubsequently with a pair of bracelets worth two hundred thousand francs.\nThe Queen, after having her diamonds reset in new patterns, told Boehmer\nthat she found her jewel case rich enough, and was not desirous of making\nany addition to it.",
        "     [Except on those days when the assemblies at Court were particularly\n     attended, such as the 1st of January and the 2d of February, devoted\n     to the procession of the Order of the Holy Ghost, and on the\n     festivals of Easter, Whitsuntide, and Christmas, the Queen no longer\n     wore any dresses but muslin or white Florentine taffety.  Her head-\n     dress was merely a hat; the plainest were preferred; and her\n     diamonds never quitted their caskets but for the dresses of\n     ceremony, confined to the days I have mentioned.  Before the Queen\n     was five and twenty she began to apprehend that she might be induced\n     to make too frequent use of flowers and of ornaments, which at that\n     time were exclusively reserved for youth.  Madame Bertin having\n     brought a wreath for the head and neck, composed of roses, the Queen\n     feared that the brightness of the flowers might be disadvantageous\n     to her complexion.  She was unquestionably too severe upon herself,\n     her beauty having as yet experienced no alteration; it is easy to\n     conceive the concert of praise and compliment that replied to the\n     doubt she had expressed.  The Queen, approaching me, said, “I charge\n     you, from this day, to give me notice when flowers shall cease to\n     become me.\"–\"I shall do no such thing,” I replied, immediately;\n     “I have not read ’Gil Bias’ without profiting in some degree from\n     it, and I find your Majesty’s order too much like that given him by\n     the Archbishop of Granada, to warn him of the moment when he should\n     begin to fall off in the composition of his homilies.\"–\"Go,” said\n     the Queen; “You are less sincere than Gil Blas; and I world have\n     been more amenable than the Archbishop.\"–MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "Still, this jeweller busied himself for some years in forming a\ncollection of the finest diamonds circulating in the trade, in order to\ncompose a necklace of several rows, which he hoped to induce her Majesty\nto purchase; he brought it to M. Campan, requesting him to mention it to\nthe Queen, that she might ask to see it, and thus be induced to wish to\npossess it.  This M. Campan refused to do, telling him that he should be\nstepping out of the line of his duty were he to propose to the Queen an\nexpense of sixteen hundred thousand francs, and that he believed neither\nthe lady of honour nor the tirewoman would take upon herself to execute\nsuch a commission.  Boehmer persuaded the King’s first gentleman for the\nyear to show this superb necklace to his Majesty, who admired it so much\nthat he himself wished to see the Queen adorned with it, and sent the\ncase to her; but she assured him she should much regret incurring so\ngreat an expense for such an article, that she had already very beautiful\ndiamonds, that jewels of that description were now worn at Court not more\nthan four or five times a year, that the necklace must be returned, and\nthat the money would be much better employed in building a man-of-war.",
        "     [Messieurs Boehmer and Bassange, jewellers to the Crown, were\n     proprietors of a superb diamond necklace, which had, as it was said,\n     been intended for the Comtesse du Barry.  Being under the necessity\n     of selling it, they offered it, during the last war, to the king and\n     Queen; but their Majesties made the following prudent answer: “We\n     stand more in need of ships than of jewels.\"–\"Secret Correspondence\n     of the Court of Louis XVI.\"]",
        "Boehmer, in sad tribulation at finding his expectations delusive,\nendeavoured for some time, it is said, to dispose of his necklace among\nthe various Courts of Europe.",
        "A year after his fruitless attempts, Boehmer again caused his diamond\nnecklace to be offered to the King, proposing that it should be paid for\npartly by instalments, and partly in life annuities; this proposal was\nrepresented as highly advantageous, and the King, in my presence,\nmentioned the matter once more to the Queen.  I remember the Queen told\nhim that, if the bargain really was not bad, he might make it, and keep\nthe necklace until the marriage of one of his children; but that, for her\npart, she would never wear it, being unwilling that the world should have\nto reproach her with having coveted so expensive an article.  The King\nreplied that their children were too young to justify such an expense,\nwhich would be greatly increased by the number of years the diamonds\nwould remain useless, and that he would finally decline the offer.\nBoehmer complained to everybody of his misfortune, and all reasonable\npeople blamed him for having collected diamonds to so considerable an\namount without any positive order for them.  This man had purchased the\noffice of jeweller to the Crown, which gave him some rights of entry at\nCourt.  After several months spent in ineffectual attempts to carry his\npoint, and in idle complaints, he obtained an audience of the Queen, who\nhad with her the young Princess, her daughter; her Majesty did not know\nfor what purpose Boehmer sought this audience, and had not the slightest\nidea that it was to speak to her again about an article twice refused by\nherself and the King.",
        "Boehmer threw himself upon his knees, clasped his hands, burst into\ntears, and exclaimed, “Madame, I am ruined and disgraced if you do not\npurchase my necklace.  I cannot outlive so many misfortunes.  When I go\nhence I shall throw myself into the river.”",
        "“Rise, Boehmer,” said the Queen, in a tone sufficiently severe to recall\nhim to himself; “I do not like these rhapsodies; honest men have no\noccasion to fall on their knees to make their requests.  If you were to\ndestroy yourself I should regret you as a madman in whom I had taken an\ninterest, but I should not be in any way responsible for that misfortune.\nNot only have I never ordered the article which causes your present\ndespair, but whenever you have talked to me about fine collections of\njewels I have told you that I should not add four diamonds to those which\nI already possessed.  I told you myself that I declined taking the\nnecklace; the King wished to give it to me, but I refused him also; never\nmention it to me again.  Divide it and try to sell it piecemeal, and do\nnot drown yourself.  I am very angry with you for acting this scene of\ndespair in my presence and before this child.  Let me never see you\nbehave thus again.  Go.”  Baehmer withdrew, overwhelmed with confusion,\nand nothing further was then heard of him.",
        "When Madame Sophie was born the Queen told me M. de Saint-James, a rich\nfinancier, had apprised her that Boehmer was still intent upon the sale\nof his necklace, and that she ought, for her own satisfaction, to\nendeavour to learn what the man had done with it; she desired me the\nfirst time I should meet him to speak to him about it, as if from the\ninterest I took in his welfare.  I spoke to him about his necklace, and\nhe told me he had been very fortunate, having sold it at Constantinople\nfor the favourite sultana.  I communicated this answer to the Queen, who\nwas delighted with it, but could not comprehend how the Sultan came to\npurchase his diamonds in Paris.",
        "The Queen long avoided seeing Boehmer, being fearful of his rash\ncharacter; and her valet de chambre, who had the care of her jewels, made\nthe necessary repairs to her ornaments unassisted.  On the baptism of the\nDuc d’Angouleme, in 1785, the King gave him a diamond epaulet and\nbuckles, and directed Baehmer to deliver them to the Queen.  Boehmer\npresented them on her return from mass, and at the same time gave into\nher hands a letter in the form of a petition.  In this paper he told the\nQueen that he was happy to see her “in possession of the finest diamonds\nknown in Europe,” and entreated her not to forget him.  The Queen read\nBoehmer’s address to her aloud, and saw nothing in it but a proof of\nmental aberration; she lighted the paper at a wax taper standing near\nher, as she had some letters to seal, saying, “It is not worth keeping.\"\nShe afterwards much regretted the loss of this enigmatical memorial.\nAfter having burnt the paper, her Majesty said to me, “That man is born\nto be my torment; he has always some mad scheme in his head; remember,\nthe first time you see him, to tell him that I do not like diamonds now,\nand that I will buy no more so long as I live; that if I had any money to\nspare I would rather add to my property at St. Cloud by the purchase of\nthe land surrounding it; now, mind you enter into all these particulars\nand impress them well upon him.”  I asked her whether she wished me to\nsend for him; she replied in the negative, adding that it would be\nsufficient to avail myself of the first opportunity afforded by meeting\nhim; and that the slightest advance towards such a man would be\nmisplaced.",
        "On the 1st of August I left Versailles for my country house at Crespy; on\nthe 3d came Boehmer, extremely uneasy at not having received any answer\nfrom the Queen, to ask me whether I had any commission from her to him; I\nreplied that she had entrusted me with none; that she had no commands for\nhim, and I faithfully repeated all she had desired me to say to him.",
        "“But,” said Boehmer, “the answer to the letter I presented to her,–to\nwhom must I apply for that?”",
        "“To nobody,” answered I; “her Majesty burnt your memorial without even\ncomprehending its meaning.”",
        "“Ah! madame,” exclaimed he, “that is impossible; the Queen knows that she\nhas money to pay me!”",
        "“Money, M. Boehmer?  Your last accounts against the Queen were discharged\nlong ago.”",
        "“Madame, you are not in the secret.  A man who is ruined for want of\npayment of fifteen hundred thousand francs cannot be said to be\nsatisfied.”",
        "“Have you lost your senses?” said I.  “For what can the Queen owe you so\nextravagant a sum?”",
        "“For my necklace, madame,” replied Boehmer, coolly.",
        "“What!” I exclaimed, “that necklace again, which you have teased the\nQueen about so many years!  Did you not tell me you had sold it at\nConstantinople?”",
        "“The Queen desired me to give that answer to all who should speak to me\non the subject,” said the wretched dupe.  He then told me that the Queen\nwished to have the necklace, and had had it purchased for her by\nMonseigneur, the Cardinal de Rohan.",
        "“You are deceived,” I exclaimed; “the Queen has not once spoken to the\nCardinal since his return from Vienna; there is not a man at her Court\nless favourably looked upon.”",
        "“You are deceived yourself, madame,” said Boehmer; “she sees him so much\nin private that it was to his Eminence she gave thirty thousand francs,\nwhich were paid me as an instalment; she took them, in his presence, out\nof the little secretaire of Sevres porcelain next the fireplace in her\nboudoir.”",
        "“And the Cardinal told you all this?”",
        "“Yes, madame, himself.”",
        "“What a detestable plot!”  cried I.",
        "“Indeed, to say the truth, madame, I begin to be much alarmed, for his\nEminence assured me that the Queen would wear the necklace on Whit-\nSunday, but I did not see it upon her, and it was that which induced me\nto write to her Majesty.”",
        "He then asked me what he ought to do.  I advised him to go on to\nVersailles, instead of returning to Paris, whence he had just arrived;\nto obtain an immediate audience from the Baron de Breteuil, who, as head\nof the King’s household, was the minister of the department to which\nBoehmer belonged, and to be circumspect; and I added that he appeared to\nme extremely culpable,–not as a diamond merchant, but because being a\nsworn officer it was unpardonable of him to have acted without the direct\norders of the King, the Queen, or the Minister.  He answered, that he had\nnot acted without direct orders; that he had in his possession all the\nnotes signed by the Queen, and that he had even been obliged to show them\nto several bankers in order to induce them to extend the time for his\npayments.  I urged his departure for Versailles, and he assured me he\nwould go there immediately.  Instead of following my advice, he went to\nthe Cardinal, and it was of this visit of Boehmer’s that his Eminence\nmade a memorandum, found in a drawer overlooked by the Abbe Georgel when\nhe burnt, by order of the Cardinal, all the papers which the latter had\nat Paris.  The memorandum was thus worded: “On this day, 3d August,\nBoehmer went to Madame Campan’s country house, and she told him that the\nQueen had never had his necklace, and that he had been deceived.”",
        "When Boehmer was gone, I wanted to follow him, and go to the Queen; my\nfather-in-law prevented me, and ordered me to leave the minister to\nelucidate such an important affair, observing that it was an infernal\nplot; that I had given Boehmer the best advice, and had nothing more to\ndo with the business.  Boehmer never said one word to me about the woman\nDe Lamotte, and her name was mentioned for the first time by the Cardinal\nin his answers to the interrogatories put to him before the King.  After\nseeing the Cardinal, Boehmer went to Trianon, and sent a message to the\nQueen, purporting that I had advised him to come and speak to her.  His\nvery words were repeated to her Majesty, who said, “He is mad; I have\nnothing to say to him, and will not see him.”  Two or three days\nafterwards the Queen sent for me to Petit Trianon, to rehearse with me\nthe part of Rosina, which she was to perform in the “Barbier de Seville.\"\nI was alone with her, sitting upon her couch; no mention was made of\nanything but the part.  After we had spent an hour in the rehearsal, her\nMajesty asked me why I had sent Boehmer to her; saying he had been in my\nname to speak to her, and that she would not see him.  It was in this\nmanner I learnt that he had not followed my advice in the slightest\ndegree.  The change of my countenance, when I heard the man’s name, was\nvery perceptible; the Queen perceived it, and questioned me.  I entreated\nher to see him, and assured her it was of the utmost importance for her\npeace of mind; that there was a plot going on, of which she was not\naware; and that it was a serious one, since engagements signed by herself\nwere shown about to people who had lent Boehmer money.  Her surprise and\nvexation were great.  She desired me to remain at Trianon, and sent off a\ncourier to Paris, ordering Boehmer to come to her upon some pretext which\nhas escaped my recollection.  He came next morning; in fact it was the\nday on which the play was performed, and that was the last amusement the\nQueen allowed herself at that retreat.",
        "The Queen made him enter her closet, and asked him by what fatality it\nwas that she was still doomed to hear of his foolish pretence of selling\nher an article which she had steadily refused for several years.  He\nreplied that he was compelled, being unable to pacify his creditors any\nlonger.  “What are your creditors to me?”  said her Majesty.  Boehmer\nthen regularly related to her all that he had been made to believe had\npassed between the Queen and himself through the intervention of the\nCardinal.  She was equally incensed and surprised at each thing she\nheard.  In vain did she speak; the jeweller, equally importunate and\ndangerous, repeated incessantly, “Madame, there is no longer time for\nfeigning; condescend to confess that you have my necklace, and let some\nassistance be given to me, or my bankruptcy will soon bring the whole to\nlight.”",
        "It is easy to imagine how the Queen must have suffered.  On Boehmer’s\ngoing away, I found her in an alarming condition; the idea that any one\ncould have believed that such a man as the Cardinal possessed her full\nconfidence; that she should have employed him to deal with a tradesman\nwithout the King’s knowledge, for a thing which she had refused to accept\nfrom the King himself, drove her to desperation.  She sent first for the\nAbbe de Vermond, and then for the Baron de Breteuil.  Their hatred and\ncontempt for the Cardinal made them too easily forget that the lowest\nfaults do not prevent the higher orders of the empire from being defended\nby those to whom they have the honour to belong; that a Rohan, a Prince\nof the Church, however culpable he might be, would be sure to have a\nconsiderable party which would naturally be joined by all the\ndiscontented persons of the Court, and all the frondeurs of Paris.\nThey too easily believed that he would be stripped of all the advantages\nof his rank and order, and given up to the disgrace due to his irregular\nconduct; they deceived themselves.",
        "I saw the Queen after the departure of the Baron and the Abbe; her\nagitation made me shudder.  “Fraud must be unmasked,” said she; “when the\nRoman purple and the title of Prince cover a mere money-seeker, a cheat\nwho dares to compromise the wife of his sovereign, France and all Europe\nshould know it.”  It is evident that from that moment the fatal plan was\ndecided on.  The Queen perceived my alarm; I did not conceal it from her.\nI knew too well that she had many enemies not to be apprehensive on\nseeing her attract the attention of the whole world to an intrigue that\nthey would try to complicate still more.  I entreated her to seek the\nmost prudent and moderate advice.  She silenced me by desiring me to make\nmyself easy, and to rest satisfied that no imprudence would be committed.",
        "On the following Sunday, the 15th of August, being the Assumption, at\ntwelve o’clock, at the very moment when the Cardinal, dressed in his\npontifical garments, was about to proceed to the chapel, he was sent for\ninto the King’s closet, where the Queen then was.",
        "The King said to him, “You have purchased diamonds of Boehmer?”",
        "“Yes, Sire.”",
        "“What have you done with them?”",
        "“I thought they had been delivered to the Queen.”",
        "“Who commissioned you?”",
        "“A lady, called the Comtesse de Lamotte-Valois, who handed me a letter\nfrom the Queen; and I thought I was gratifying her Majesty by taking this\nbusiness on myself.”",
        "The Queen here interrupted him and said, “How, monsieur, could you\nbelieve that I should select you, to whom I have not spoken for eight\nyears, to negotiate anything for me, and especially through the mediation\nof a woman whom I do not even know?”",
        "“I see plainly,” said the Cardinal, “that I have been duped.  I will pay\nfor the necklace; my desire to please your Majesty blinded me; I\nsuspected no trick in the affair, and I am sorry for it.”",
        "He then took out of his pocket-book a letter from the Queen to Madame de\nLamotte, giving him this commission.  The King took it, and, holding it\ntowards the Cardinal, said:",
        "“This is neither written nor signed by the Queen.  How could a Prince of\nthe House of Rohan, and a Grand Almoner of France, ever think that the\nQueen would sign Marie Antoinette de France?  Everybody knows that queens\nsign only by their baptismal names.  But, monsieur,” pursued the King,\nhanding him a copy of his letter to Baehmer, “have you ever written such\na letter as this?”",
        "Having glanced over it, the Cardinal said, “I do not remember having\nwritten it.”",
        "“But what if the original, signed by yourself, were shown to you?”",
        "“If the letter be signed by myself it is genuine.”",
        "He was extremely confused, and repeated several times, “I have been\ndeceived, Sire; I will pay for the necklace.  I ask pardon of your\nMajesties.”",
        "“Then explain to me,” resumed the King, “the whole of this enigma.  I do\nnot wish to find you guilty; I had rather you would justify yourself.\nAccount for all the manoeuvres with Baehmer, these assurances and these\nletters.”",
        "The Cardinal then, turning pale, and leaning against the table, said,\n\"Sire, I am too much confused to answer your Majesty in a way–”",
        "“Compose yourself, Cardinal, and go into my cabinet; you will there find\npaper, pens, and ink,–write what you have to say to me.”",
        "The Cardinal went into the King’s cabinet, and returned a quarter of an\nhour afterwards with a document as confused as his verbal answers had\nbeen.  The King then said, “Withdraw, monsieur.”  The Cardinal left the\nKing’s chamber, with the Baron de Breteuil, who gave him in custody to a\nlieutenant of the Body Guard, with orders to take him to his apartment.\nM. d’Agoult, aide-major of the Body Guard, afterwards took him into\ncustody, and conducted him to his hotel, and thence to the Bastille.  But\nwhile the Cardinal had with him only the young lieutenant of the Body\nGuard, who was much embarrassed at having such an order to execute, his\nEminence met his heyduc at the door of the Salon of Hercules; he spoke to\nhim in German and then asked the lieutenant if he could lend him a\npencil; the officer gave him that which he carried about him, and the\nCardinal wrote to the Abbe Georgel, his grand vicar and friend, instantly\nto burn all Madame de Lamotte’s correspondence, and all his other\nletters.",
        "     [The Abbe Georgel thus relates the circumstance: The Cardinal, at\n     that trying moment, gave an astonishing proof of his presence of\n     mind; notwithstanding the escort which surrounded him, favoured by\n     the attendant crowd, he stopped, and stooping down with his face\n     towards the wall, as if to fasten his buckle, snatched out his\n     pencil and hastily wrote a few words upon a scrap of paper placed\n     under his hand in his square red cap.  He rose again and proceeded.\n     on entering his house, his people formed a lane; he slipped this\n     paper, unperceived, into the hand of a confidential valet de\n     chambre, who waited for him at the door of his apartment.”  This\n     story is scarcely credible; it is not at the moment of a prisoner’s\n     arrest, when an inquisitive crowd surrounds and watches him, that he\n     can stop and write secret messages.  However, the valet de chambre\n     posts off to Paris.  He arrives at the palace of the Cardinal\n     between twelve and one o’clock; and his horse falls dead in the\n     stable.  “I was in my apartment,” said the Abbe Georgel, “the valet\n     de chambre entered wildly, with a deadly paleness on his\n     countenance, and exclaimed, ’All is lost; the Prince is arrested.’\n     He instantly fell, fainting, and dropped the note of which he was\n     the bearer.”  The portfolio containing the papers which might\n     compromise the Cardinal was immediately placed beyond the reach of\n     all search.  Madame de Lamotte also was foolishly allowed sufficient\n     time after she heard of the arrest of the Cardinal to burn all the\n     letters she had received from him.  Assisted by Beugnot, she\n     completed this at three the same morning that she was: arrested at\n     four.–See “Memoirs of Comte de Beugnot,” vol i., p. 74.]",
        "This commission was executed before M. de Crosne, lieutenant of police,\nhad received an order from the Baron de Breteuil to put seals upon the\nCardinal’s papers.  The destruction of all his Eminence’s correspondence,\nand particularly that with Madame de Lamotte, threw an impenetrable cloud\nover the whole affair.",
        "From that moment all proofs of this intrigue disappeared.  Madame de\nLamotte was apprehended at Bar-sur-Aube; her husband had already gone to\nEngland.  From the beginning of this fatal affair all the proceedings of\nthe Court appear to have been prompted by imprudence and want of\nforesight; the obscurity resulting left free scope for the fables of\nwhich the voluminous memorials written on one side and the other\nconsisted.  The Queen so little imagined what could have given rise to\nthe intrigue, of which she was about to become the victim, that, at the\nmoment when the King was interrogating the Cardinal, a terrific idea\nentered her mind.  With that rapidity of thought caused by personal\ninterest and extreme agitation, she fancied that, if a design to ruin her\nin the eyes of the King and the French people were the concealed motive\nof this intrigue, the Cardinal would, perhaps, affirm that she had the\nnecklace; that he had been honoured with her confidence for this\npurchase, made without the King’s knowledge; and point out some secret\nplace in her apartment, where he might have got some villain to hide it.\nWant of money and the meanest swindling were the sole motives for this\ncriminal affair.  The necklace had already been taken to pieces and sold,\npartly in London, partly in Holland, and the rest in Paris.",
        "The moment the Cardinal’s arrest was known a universal clamour arose.\nEvery memorial that appeared during the trial increased the outcry.\nOn this occasion the clergy took that course which a little wisdom and\nthe least knowledge of the spirit of such a body ought to have foreseen.\nThe Rohans and the House of Conde, as well as the clergy, made their\ncomplaints heard everywhere.  The King consented to having a legal\njudgment, and early in September he addressed letters-patent to the\nParliament, in which he said that he was “filled with the most just\nindignation on seeing the means which, by the confession of his Eminence\nthe Cardinal, had been employed in order to inculpate his most dear\nspouse and companion.”",
        "Fatal moment!  in which the Queen found herself, in consequence of this\nhighly impolitic step, on trial with a subject, who ought to have been\ndealt with by the power of the King alone.  The Princes and Princesses of\nthe House of Conde, and of the Houses of Rohan, Soubise, and Guemenee,\nput on mourning, and were seen ranged in the way of the members of the\nGrand Chamber to salute them as they proceeded to the palace, on the days\nof the Cardinal’s trial; and Princes of the blood openly canvassed\nagainst the Queen of France.",
        "The Pope wished to claim, on behalf of the Cardinal de Rohan, the right\nbelonging to his ecclesiastical rank, and demanded that he should be\njudged at Rome.  The Cardinal de Bernis, ambassador from France to his\nHoliness, formerly Minister for Foreign Affairs, blending the wisdom of\nan old diplomatist with the principles of a Prince of the Church, wished\nthat this scandalous affair should be hushed up.  The King’s aunts, who\nwere on very intimate terms with the ambassador, adopted his opinion, and\nthe conduct of the King and Queen was equally and loudly censured in the\napartments of Versailles and in the hotels and coffee-houses of Paris.",
        "Madame, the King’s sister-in-law, had been the sole protectress of De\nLamotte, and had confined her patronage to granting her a pension of\ntwelve to fifteen hundred francs.  Her brother was in the navy, but the\nMarquis de Chabert, to whom he had been recommended, could never train a\ngood officer.  The Queen in vain endeavoured to call to mind the features\nof this person, of whom she had often heard as an intriguing woman, who\ncame frequently on Sundays to the gallery of Versailles.  At the time\nwhen all France was engrossed by the persecution against the Cardinal,\nthe portrait of the Comtesse de Lamotte  Valois was publicly sold.  Her\nMajesty desired me one day, when I was going to Paris, to buy her the\nengraving, which was said to be a tolerable likeness, that she might\nascertain whether she could recognise in it any person whom she might\nhave seen in the gallery.",
        "     [The public, with the exception of the lowest class, were admitted\n     into the gallery and larger apartments of Versailles, as they were\n     into the park.–MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "The woman De Lamotte’s father was a peasant at Auteuil, though he called\nhimself Valois.  Madame de Boulainvilliers once saw from her terrace two\npretty little peasant girls, each labouring under a heavy bundle of\nsticks.  The priest of the village, who was walking with her, told her\nthat the children possessed some curious papers, and that he had no doubt\nthey were descendants of a Valois, an illegitimate son of one of the\nprinces of that name.",
        "The family of Valois had long ceased to appear in the world.  Hereditary\nvices had gradually plunged them into the deepest misery.  I have heard\nthat the last Valois then known occupied the estate called Gros Bois;\nthat as he seldom came to Court, Louis XIII. asked him what he was about\nthat he remained so constantly in the country; and that this M. de Valois\nmerely answered, “Sire, I only do there what I ought.”  It was shortly\nafterwards discovered that he was coining.",
        "Neither the Queen herself nor any one near her ever had the slightest\nconnection with the woman De Lamotte; and during her prosecution she\ncould point out but one of the Queen’s servants, named Desclos, a valet\nof the Queen’s bedchamber, to whom she pre tended she had delivered\nBoehmer’s necklace.  This Desclos was a very honest man; upon being\nconfronted with the woman De Lamotte, it was proved that she had never\nseen him but once, which was at the house of the wife of a surgeon-\naccoucheur at Versailles, the only person she visited at Court; and that\nshe had not given him the necklace.  Madame de Lamotte married a private\nin Monsieur’s body-guard; she lodged at Versailles at the Belle Image, a\nvery inferior furnished house; and it is inconceivable how so obscure a\nperson could succeed in making herself believed to be a friend of the\nQueen, who, though so extremely affable, seldom granted audiences, and\nonly to titled persons.",
        "The trial of the Cardinal is too generally known to require me to repeat\nits details here.  The point most embarrassing to him was the interview\nhe had in February, 1785, with M. de Saint-James, to whom he confided the\nparticulars of the Queen’s pretended commission, and showed the contract\napproved and signed Marie Antoinette de France.  The memorandum found in\na drawer of the Cardinal’s bureau, in which he had himself written what\nBaehmer told him after having seen me at my country house, was likewise\nan unfortunate document for his Eminence.",
        "I offered to the King to go and declare that Baehmer had told me that the\nCardinal assured him he had received from the Queen’s own hand the thirty\nthousand francs given on account upon the bargain being concluded, and\nthat his Eminence had seen her Majesty take that sum in bills from the\nporcelain secretaire in her boudoir.  The King declined my offer, and\nsaid to me, “Were you alone when Boehmer told you this?”  I answered that\nI was alone with him in my garden.  “Well,” resumed he, “the man would\ndeny the fact; he is now sure of being paid his sixteen hundred thousand\nfrancs, which the Cardinal’s family will find it necessary to make good\nto him; we can no longer rely upon his sincerity; it would look as if you\nwere sent by the Queen, and that would not be proper.”",
        "     [The guilty woman no sooner knew that all was about to be discovered\n     than she sent for the jewellers, and told them the Cardinal had\n     perceived that the agreement, which he believed to have been signed\n     by the Queen, was a false and forged document.  “However,” added\n     she, “the Cardinal possesses a considerable fortune, and he can very\n     well pay you.”  These words reveal the whole secret.  The Countess\n     had taken the necklace to herself, and flattered herself that M. de\n     Rohan, seeing himself deceived and cruelly imposed upon, would\n     determine to pay and make the beat terms he could, rather than\n     suffer a matter of this nature to become public.-\"Secret\n     Correspondence of the Court of Louis XVI.\"]",
        "The procureur general’s information was severe on the Cardinal.  The\nHouses of Conde and Rohan and the majority of the nobility saw in this\naffair only an attack on the Prince’s rank, the clergy only a blow aimed\nat the privileges of a cardinal.  The clergy demanded that the\nunfortunate business of the Prince Cardinal de Rohan should be submitted\nto ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and the Archbishop of Narbonne, then\nPresident of the Convocation, made representations upon the subject to\nthe King; the bishops wrote to his Majesty to remind him that a private\necclesiastic implicated in the affair then pending would have a right to\nclaim his constitutional judges, and that this right was refused to a\ncardinal, his superior in the hierarchical order.  In short, the clergy\nand the greater part of the nobility were at that time outrageous against\nauthority, and chiefly against the Queen.",
        "The procureur-general’s conclusions, and those of a part of the heads of\nthe magistracy, were as severe towards the Cardinal as the information\nhad been; yet he was fully acquitted by a majority of three voices; the\nwoman De Lamotte was condemned to be whipped, branded, and imprisoned;\nand her husband, for contumacy, was condemned to the galleys for life.",
        "     [The following extract is from the “Memoirs” of the Abbe Georgel:\n     “The sittings were long and multiplied; it was necessary to read the\n     whole proceedings; more than fifty judges sat; a master of requests;\n     a friend of the Prince, wrote down all that was said there, and sent\n     it to his advisers, who found means to inform the Cardinal of it,\n     and to add the plan of conduct he ought to pursue.”  D’Epremesnil,\n     and other young counsellors, showed upon that occasion but too much\n     audacity in braving the Court, too much eagerness in seizing an\n     opportunity of attacking it.  They were the first to shake that\n     authority which their functions made it a duty in them to respect.-\n     NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]",
        "M. Pierre de Laurencel, the procureur general’s substitute, sent the\nQueen a list of the names of the members of the Grand Chamber, with the\nmeans made use of by the friends of the Cardinal to gain their votes\nduring the trial.  I had this list to keep among the papers which the\nQueen deposited in the house of M. Campan, my father-in-law, and which,\nat his death, she ordered me to preserve.  I burnt this statement, but I\nremember ladies performed a part not very creditable to their principles;\nit was by them, in consideration of large sums which they received, that\nsome of the oldest and most respected members were won over.  I did not\nsee a single name amongst the whole Parliament that was gained directly.",
        "The belief confirmed by time is, that the Cardinal was completely duped\nby the woman De Lamotte and Cagliostro.  The King may have been in error\nin thinking him an accomplice in this miserable and criminal scheme, but\nI have faithfully repeated his Majesty’s judgment about it.",
        "However, the generally received opinion that the Baron de Breteuil’s\nhatred for the Cardinal was the cause of the scandal and the unfortunate\nresult of this affair contributed to the disgrace of the former still\nmore than his refusal to give his granddaughter in marriage to the son of\nthe Duc de Polignac.  The Abbe de Vermond threw the whole blame of the\nimprudence and impolicy of the affair of the Cardinal de Rohan upon the\nminister, and ceased to be the friend and supporter of the Baron de\nBreteuil with the Queen.",
        "In the early part of the year 1786, the Cardinal, as has been said,\nwas fully acquitted, and came out of the Bastille, while Madame de\nLamotte was condemned to be whipped, branded, and imprisoned.  The Court,\npersisting in the erroneous views which had hitherto guided its measures,\nconceived that the Cardinal and the woman De Lamotte were equally\nculpable and unequally punished, and sought to restore the balance of\njustice by exiling the Cardinal to La Chaise-Dieu, and suffering Madame\nde Lamotte to escape a few days after she entered l’Hopital.  This new\nerror confirmed the Parisians in the idea that the wretch De Lamotte, who\nhad never been able to make her way so far as to the room appropriated to\nthe Queen’s women, had really interested the Queen herself.",
        "     [Further particulars will be found in the “Memoirs of the Comte de\n     Beugnot” (London: Hurst & Blackett, 1871), as he knew Madame de\n     Lamotte from the days of her early childhood (when the three\n     children, the Baron de Valois, who died captain of a frigate, and\n     the two Mademoiselles de Saint-Remi, the last descendants of the\n     Baron de Saint-Remi, a natural son of Henri II., were almost\n     starving) to the time of her temporary prosperity.  In fact, he was\n     with her when she burnt the correspondence of the Cardinal, in the\n     interval the Court foolishly allowed between his arrest and her\n     capture, and De Beugnot believed he had met at her house, at the\n     moment of their return from their successful trick, the whole party\n     engaged in deluding the Cardinal.  It is worth noting that he was\n     then struck by the face of Mademoiselle d’Oliva, who had just\n     personated the Queen in presenting a rose to the Cardinal.  It may\n     also be cited as a pleasing quality of Madame de Lamotte that she,\n     “in her ordinary conversation, used the words stupid and honest as\n     synonymous.\"–See “Beugnot,” vol. i., p. 60.]",
        "The Abbe de Vermond could not repress his exultation when he succeeded in\ngetting the Archbishop of Sens appointed head of the council of finance.\nI have more than once heard him say that seventeen years of patience were\nnot too long a term for success in a Court; that he spent all that time\nin gaining the end he had in view; but that at length the Archbishop was\nwhere he ought to be for the good of the State.  The Abbe, from this\ntime, in the Queen’s private circle no longer concealed his credit and\ninfluence; nothing could equal the confidence with which he displayed the\nextent of his pretensions.  He requested the Queen to order that the\napartments appropriated to him should be enlarged, telling her that,\nbeing obliged to give audiences to bishops, cardinals, and ministers, he\nrequired a residence suitable to his present circumstances.  The Queen\ncontinued to treat him as she did before the Archbishop’s arrival at\nCourt; but the household showed him increased consideration: the word\n\"Monsieur” preceded that of Abbe; and from that moment not only the\nlivery servants, but also the people of the antechambers rose when\nMonsieur l’Abbe was passing, though there never was, to my knowledge,\nany order given to that effect.",
        "The Queen was obliged, on account of the King’s disposition and the very\nlimited confidence he placed in the Archbishop of Sens, to take a part in\npublic affairs.  While M. de Maurepas lived she kept out of that danger,\nas may be seen by the censure which the Baron de Besenval passes on her\nin his memoirs for not availing herself of the conciliation he had\npromoted between the Queen and that minister, who counteracted the\nascendency which the Queen and her intimate friends might otherwise have\ngained over the King’s mind.",
        "The Queen has often assured me that she never interfered respecting the\ninterests of Austria but once; and that was only to claim the execution\nof the treaty of alliance at the time when Joseph II. was at war with\nPrussia and Turkey; that, she then demanded that an army of twenty-four\nthousand men should be sent to him instead of fifteen millions, an\nalternative which had been left to option in the treaty, in case the\nEmperor should have a just war to maintain; that she could not obtain her\nobject, and M. de Vergennes, in an interview which she had with him upon\nthe subject, put an end to her importunities by observing that he was\nanswering the mother of the Dauphin and not the sister of the Emperor.\nThe fifteen millions were sent.  There was no want of money at Vienna,\nand the value of a French army was fully appreciated.",
        "“But how,” said the Queen, “could they be so wicked as to send off those\nfifteen millions from the general post-office, diligently publishing,\neven to the street porters, that they were loading carriages with money\nthat I was sending to my brother!–whereas it is certain that the money\nwould equally have been sent if I had belonged to another house; and,\nbesides, it was sent contrary to my inclination.”",
        "     [This was not the first time the Queen had become unpopular in\n     consequence of financial support afforded by France to her brother.\n     The Emperor Joseph II, made, in November, 1783, and in May, 1784,\n     startling claims on the republic of the United Provinces; he\n     demanded the opening of the Scheldt, the cession of Maeatricht with\n     its dependencies, of the country beyond the Meuse, the county of\n     Vroenhoven, and a sum of seventy millions of florins.  The first gun\n     was fired by the Emperor on the Scheldt 6th November, 1784.  Peace\n     was concluded 8th November, 1785, through the mediation of France.\n     The singular part was the indemnification granted to the Emperor:\n     this was a sum of ten millions of Dutch florins; the articles 15,\n     16, and 17 of the treaty stipulated the quotas of it.  Holland paid\n     five millions and a half, and France, under the direction of M. de\n     Vergennes, four millions and a half of florins, that is to say, nine\n     millions and forty-five thousand francs, according to M. Soulavie.\n     M. de augur, in his “Policy of Cabinets” (vol. iii.), says relative\n     to this affair:",
        "     “M. de Vergennes has been much blamed for having terminated, by a\n     sacrifice of seven millions, the contest that existed between the\n     United Provinces and the Emperor.  In that age of philosophy men\n     were still very uncivilised; in that age of commerce they made very\n     erroneous calculations; and those who accused the Queen of sending\n     the gold of France to her brother would have been better pleased if,\n     to support a republic devoid of energy, the blood of two hundred\n     thousand men, and three or four hundred millions of francs, had been\n     sacrificed, and at the same time the risk run of losing the\n     advantage of peace dictated to England.”  MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "When the Comte de Moustier set out on his mission to the United States,\nafter having had his public audience of leave he came and asked me to\nprocure him a private one.  I could not succeed even with the strongest\nsolicitations; the Queen desired me to wish him a good voyage, but added\nthat none but ministers could have anything to say to him in private,\nsince he was going to a country where the names of King and Queen must be\ndetested.",
        "Marie Antoinette had then no direct influence over State affairs until\nafter the deaths of M. de Maurepas and M. de Vergennes, and the\nretirement of M. de Calonne.  She frequently regretted her new situation,\nand looked upon it as a misfortune which she could not avoid.  One day,\nwhile I was assisting her to tie up a number of memorials and reports,\nwhich some of the ministers had handed to her to be given to the King,\n\"Ah!” said she, sighing, “there is an end of all happiness for me, since\nthey have made an intriguer of me.”  I exclaimed at the word.",
        "“Yes,” resumed, the Queen, “that is the right term; every woman who\nmeddles with affairs above her understanding or out of her line of duty\nis an intriguer and nothing else; you will remember, however, that it is\nnot my own fault, and that it is with regret I give myself such a title;\nQueens of France are happy only so long as they meddle with nothing, and\nmerely preserve influence sufficient to advance their friends and reward\na few zealous servants.  Do you know what happened to me lately?  One day\nsince I began to attend private committees at the King’s, while crossing\nthe oiel-de-boeuf, I heard one of the musicians of the chapel say so loud\nthat I lost not a single word, ’A Queen who does her duty will remain in\nher apartment to knit.’ I said within myself, ’Poor wretch, thou art\nright; but thou knowest not my situation; I yield to necessity and my\nevil destiny.’”",
        "This situation was the more painful to the Queen inasmuch as Louis XVI.\nhad long accustomed himself to say nothing to her respecting State\naffairs; and when, towards the close of his reign, she was obliged to\ninterfere in the most important matters, the same habit in the King\nfrequently kept from her particulars which it was necessary she should\nhave known.  Obtaining, therefore, only insufficient information, and\nguided by persons more ambitious than skilful, the Queen could not be\nuseful in important affairs; yet, at the same time, her ostensible\ninterference drew upon her, from all parties and all classes of society,\nan unpopularity the rapid progress of which alarmed all those who were\nsincerely attached to her.",
        "Carried away by the eloquence of the Archbishop of Sens, and encouraged\nin the confidence she placed in that minister by the incessant eulogies\nof the Abbe de Vermond on his abilities, the Queen unfortunately followed\nup her first mistake of bringing him into office in 1787 by supporting\nhim at the time of his disgrace, which was obtained by the despair of a\nwhole nation.  She thought it was due to her dignity to give him some\nmarked proof of her regard at the moment of his departure; misled by her\nfeelings, she sent him her portrait enriched with jewelry, and a brevet\nfor the situation of lady of the palace for Madame de Canisy, his niece,\nobserving that it was necessary to indemnify a minister sacrificed to the\nintrigues of the Court and a factious spirit of the nation; that\notherwise none would be found willing to devote themselves to the\ninterests of the sovereign.",
        "On the day of the Archbishop’s departure the public joy was universal,\nboth at Court and at Paris there were bonfires; the attorneys’ clerks\nburnt the Archbishop in effigy, and on the evening of his disgrace more\nthan a hundred couriers were sent out from Versailles to spread the happy\ntidings among the country seats.  I have seen the Queen shed bitter tears\nat the recollection of the errors she committed at this period, when\nsubsequently, a short time before her death, the Archbishop had the\naudacity to say, in a speech which was printed, that the sole object of\none part of his operations, during his administration, was the salutary\ncrisis which the Revolution had produced.",
        "The benevolence and generosity shown by the King and Queen during the\nsevere winter of 1788, when the Seine was frozen over and the cold was\nmore intense than it had been for eighty years, procured them some\nfleeting popularity.  The gratitude of the Parisians for the succour\ntheir Majesties poured forth was lively if not lasting.  The snow was so\nabundant that since that period there has never been seen such a\nprodigious quantity in France.  In different parts of Paris pyramids and\nobelisks of snow were erected with inscriptions expressive of the\ngratitude of the people.  The pyramid in the Rue d’Angiviller was\nsupported on a base six feet high by twelve broad; it rose to the height\nof fifteen feet, and was terminated by a globe.  Four blocks of stone,\nplaced at the angles, corresponded with the obelisk, and gave it an\nelegant appearance.  Several inscriptions, in honour of the King and\nQueen, were affixed to it.  I went to see this singular monument, and\nrecollect the following inscription",
        "          “Lovely and good, to tender pity true,\n          Queen of a virtuous King, this trophy view;\n          Cold ice and snow sustain its fragile form,\n          But ev’ry grateful heart to thee is warm.\n          Oh, may this tribute in your hearts excite,\n          Illustrious pair, more pure and real delight,\n          Whilst thus your virtues are sincerely prais’d,\n          Than pompous domes by servile flatt’ry rais’d.”",
        "The theatres generally rang with praises of the beneficence of the\nsovereigns: “La Partie de Chasse de Henri IV.” was represented for the\nbenefit of the poor.  The receipts were very considerable.",
        "When the fruitless measure of the Assembly of the Notables, and the\nrebellious spirit in the parliaments,",
        "     [The Assembly of the Notables, as may be seen in “Weber’s\n     Memoirs,” vol. i., overthrew the plans and caused the downfall\n     of M. de Calonne.  A prince of the blood presided over each of the\n     meetings of that assembly.  Monsieur, afterwards Louis XVIII.,\n     presided over the first meeting.",
        "     “Monsieur,” says a contemporary, “gained great reputation at the\n     Assembly of the Notables in 1787.  He did not miss attending his\n     meeting a single day, and he displayed truly patriotic virtues.\n     His care in discussing the weighty matters of administration, in\n     throwing light upon them, and in defending the interests and the\n     cause of the people, was such as even to inspire the King with some\n     degree of jealousy.  Monsieur openly said that a respectful\n     resistance to the orders of the monarch was not blamable, and that\n     authority might be met by argument, and forced to receive\n     information without any offence whatever.\"–NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]",
        "had created the necessity for States General, it was long discussed in\ncouncil whether they should be assembled at Versailles or at forty or\nsixty leagues from the capital; the Queen was for the latter course, and\ninsisted to the King that they ought to be far away from the immense\npopulation of Paris.  She feared that the people would influence the\ndeliberations of the deputies; several memorials were presented to the\nKing upon that question; but M. Necker prevailed, and Versailles was the\nplace fixed upon.",
        "The day on which the King announced that he gave his consent to the\nconvocation of the States General, the Queen left the public dinner,\nand placed herself in the recess of the first window of her bedchamber,\nwith her face towards the garden.  Her chief butler followed her, to\npresent her coffee, which she usually took standing, as she was about to\nleave the table.  She beckoned to me to come close to her.  The King was\nengaged in conversation with some one in his room.  When the attendant\nhad served her he retired; and she addressed me, with the cup still in\nher hand: “Great Heavens! what fatal news goes forth this day!  The King\nassents to the convocation of the States General.”  Then she added,\nraising her eyes to heaven, “I dread it; this important event is a first\nfatal signal of discord in France.”  She cast her eyes down, they were\nfilled with tears.  She could not take the remainder of her coffee, but\nhanded me the cup, and went to join the King.  In the evening, when she\nwas alone with me, she spoke only of this momentous decision.  “It is the\nParliament,” said she, “that has compelled the King to have recourse to a\nmeasure long considered fatal to the repose of the kingdom.  These\ngentlemen wish to restrain the power of the King; but they give a great\nshock to the authority of which they make so bad a use, and they will\nbring on their own destruction.”",
        "The double representation granted to the Tiers Etat was now the chief\ntopic of conversation.  The Queen favoured this plan, to which the King\nhad agreed; she thought the hope of obtaining ecclesiastical favours\nwould secure the clergy of the second order, and that M. Necker was sure\nto have the same degree of influence over the lawyers, and other people\nof that class comprised in the Tiers Dat.  The Comte d’Artois, holding\nthe contrary opinion, presented a memorial in the names of himself and\nseveral princes of the blood to the King against the double\nrepresentation.  The Queen was displeased with him for this; her\nconfidential advisers infused into her apprehensions that the Prince was\nmade the tool of a party; but his conduct was approved of by Madame de\nPolignac’s circle, which the Queen thenceforward only frequented to avoid\nthe appearance of a change in her habits.  She almost always returned\nunhappy; she was treated with the profound respect due to a queen, but\nthe devotion of friendship had vanished, to make way for the coldness of\netiquette, which wounded her deeply.  The alienation between her and the\nComte Artois was also very painful to her, for she had loved him almost\nas tenderly as if he had been her own brother.",
        "The opening of the States General took place on the 4th of May, 1789.\nThe Queen on that occasion appeared for the last time in her life in\nregal magnificence.  During the procession some low women, seeing the\nQueen pass, cried out “Vive le Duc d’ Orleans!”  in so threatening a\nmanner that she nearly fainted.  She was obliged to be supported, and\nthose about her were afraid it would be necessary to stop the procession.\nThe Queen, however, recovered herself, and much regretted that she had\nnot been able to command more presence of mind.",
        "The rapidly increasing distrust of the King and Queen shown by the\npopulace was greatly attributable to incessant corruption by English\ngold, and the projects, either of revenge or of ambition, of the Duc\nd’Orleans.  Let it not be thought that this accusation is founded on what\nhas been so often repeated by the heads of the French Government since\nthe Revolution.  Twice between the 14th of July and the 6th of October,\n1789, the day on which the Court was dragged to Paris, the Queen\nprevented me from making little excursions thither of business or\npleasure, saying to me, “Do not go on such a day to Paris; the English\nhave been scattering gold, we shall have some disturbance.”  The repeated\nvisits of the Duc d’Orleans to England had excited the Anglomania to such\na pitch that Paris was no longer distinguishable from London.  The\nFrench, formerly imitated by the whole of Europe, became on a sudden a\nnation of imitators, without considering the evils that arts and\nmanufactures must suffer in consequence of the change.  Since the treaty\nof commerce made with England at the peace of 1783, not merely equipages,\nbut everything, even to ribands and common earthenware, were of English\nmake.  If this predominance of English fashions had been confined to\nfilling our drawing-rooms with young men in English frock-coats, instead\nof the French dress, good taste and commerce might alone have suffered;\nbut the principles of English government had taken possession of these\nyoung heads.  Constitution, Upper House, Lower House, national guarantee,\nbalance of power, Magna Charta, Law of Habeas Corpus,–all these words\nwere incessantly repeated, and seldom understood; but they were of\nfundamental importance to a party which was then forming.",
        "The first sitting of the States took place on the following day.  The\nKing delivered his speech with firmness and dignity; the Queen told me\nthat he had taken great pains about it, and had repeated it frequently.\nHis Majesty gave public marks of attachment and respect for the Queen,\nwho was applauded; but it was easy to see that this applause was in fact\nrendered to the King alone.",
        "It was evident, during the first sittings, that Mirabeau would be very\ndangerous to the Government.  It affirmed that at this period he\ncommunicated to the King, and still more fully to the Queen, part of his\nschemes for abandoning them.  He brandished the weapons afforded him by\nhis eloquence and audacity, in order to make terms with the party he\nmeant to attack.  This man played the game of revolution to make his own\nfortune.  The Queen told me that he asked for an embassy, and, if my\nmemory does not deceive me, it was that of Constantinople.  He was\nrefused with well-deserved contempt, though policy would doubtless have\nconcealed it, could the future have been foreseen.",
        "The enthusiasm prevailing at the opening of this assembly, and the\ndebates between the Tiers Etat, the nobility, and even the clergy, daily\nincreased the alarm of their Majesties, and all who were attached to the\ncause of monarchy.  The Queen went to bed late, or rather she began to be\nunable to rest.  One evening, about the end of May, she was sitting in\nher room, relating several remarkable occurrences of the day; four wax\ncandles were placed upon her toilet-table; the first went out of itself;\nI relighted it; shortly afterwards the second, and then the third went\nout also; upon which the Queen, squeezing my hand in terror, said to me:\n\"Misfortune makes us superstitious; if the fourth taper should go out\nlike the rest, nothing can prevent my looking upon it as a sinister\nomen.”  The fourth taper went out.  It was remarked to the Queen that the\nfour tapers had probably been run in the same mould, and that a defect in\nthe wick had naturally occurred at the same point in each, since the\ncandles had all gone out in the order in which they had been lighted.",
        "The deputies of the Tiers Etat arrived at Versailles full of the\nstrongest prejudices against the Court.  They believed that the King\nindulged in the pleasures of the table to a shameful excess; and that the\nQueen was draining the treasury of the State in order to satisfy the most\nunbridled luxury.  They almost all determined to see Petit Trianon.  The\nextreme plainness of the retreat in question not answering the ideas they\nhad formed, some of them insisted upon seeing the very smallest closets,\nsaying that the richly furnished apartments were concealed from them.\nThey particularised one which, according to them, was ornamented with\ndiamonds, and with wreathed columns studded with sapphires and rubies.\nThe Queen could not get these foolish ideas out of her mind, and spoke to\nthe King on the subject.  From the description given of this room by the\ndeputies to the keepers of Trianon, the King concluded that they were\nlooking for the scene enriched with paste ornaments, made in the reign of\nLouis XV. for the theatre of Fontainebleau.",
        "The King supposed that his Body Guards, on their return to the country,\nafter their quarterly duty at Court, related what they had seen, and that\ntheir exaggerated accounts, being repeated, became at last totally\nperverted.  This idea of the King, after the search for the diamond\nchamber, suggested to the Queen that the report of the King’s propensity\nfor drinking also sprang from the guards who accompanied his carriage\nwhen he hunted at Rambouillet.  The King, who disliked sleeping out of\nhis usual bed, was accustomed to leave that hunting-seat after supper;\nhe generally slept soundly in his carriage, and awoke only on his arrival\nat the courtyard of his palace; he used to get down from his carriage in\nthe midst of his Body Guards, staggering, as a man half awake will do,\nwhich was mistaken for intoxication.",
        "The majority of the deputies who came imbued with prejudices produced by\nerror or malevolence, went to lodge with the most humble private\nindividuals of Versailles, whose inconsiderate conversation contributed\nnot a little to nourish such mistakes.  Everything, in short, tended to\nrender the deputies subservient to the schemes of the leaders of the\nrebellion.",
        "Shortly after the opening of the States General the first Dauphin died.\nThat young Prince suffered from the rickets, which in a few months curved\nhis spine, and rendered his legs so weak that he could not walk without\nbeing supported like a feeble old man.",
        "     [Louis, Dauphin of France, who died at Versailles on the 4th of\n     June, 1789, gave promise of intellectual precocity.  The following\n     particulars, which convey some idea of his disposition, and of the\n     assiduous attention bestowed upon him by the Duchesse de Polignac,\n     will be found in a work of that time: “At two years old the Dauphin\n     was very pretty; he articulated well, and answered questions put to\n     him intelligently.  While he was at the Chateau de La Muette\n     everybody was at liberty to see him.  The Dauphin was dressed\n     plainly, like a sailor; there was nothing to distinguish him from\n     other children in external appearance but the cross of Saint Louis,\n     the blue ribbon, and the Order of the Fleece, decorations that are\n     the distinctive signs of his rank.  The Duchesse Jules de Polignac,\n     his governess, scarcely ever left him for a single instant: she gave\n     up all the Court excursions and amusements in order to devote her\n     whole attention to him.  The Prince always manifested a great regard\n     for M. de Bourset, his valet de chambre.  During the illness of\n     which he died, he one day asked for a pair of scissors; that\n     gentleman reminded him that they were forbidden.  The child insisted\n     mildly, and they were obliged to yield to him.  Having got the\n     scissors, he cut off a lock of his hair, which he wrapped in a sheet\n     of paper: ’There, monsieur,’ said he to his valet de chambre,’ there\n     is the only present I can make you, having nothing at my command;\n     but when I am dead you will present this pledge to my papa and\n     mamma; and while they remember me, I hope they will not forget\n     you.’\"–NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]",
        "How many maternal tears did his condition draw from the Queen, already\noverwhelmed with apprehensions respecting the state of the kingdom!  Her\ngrief was enhanced by petty intrigues, which, when frequently renewed,\nbecame intolerable.  An open quarrel between the families and friends of\nthe Duc Harcourt, the Dauphin’s governor, and those of the Duchesse de\nPolignac, his governess, added greatly to the Queen’s affliction.  The\nyoung Prince showed a strong dislike to the Duchesse de Polignac, who\nattributed it either to the Duc or the Duchesse d’Harcourt, and came to\nmake her complaints respecting it to the Queen.  The Dauphin twice sent\nher out of his room, saying to her, with that maturity of manner which\nlong illness always gives to children: “Go out, Duchess; you are so fond\nof using perfumes, and they always make me ill;” and yet she never used\nany.  The Queen perceived, also, that his prejudices against her friend\nextended to herself; her son would no longer speak in her presence.  She\nknew that he had become fond of sweetmeats, and offered him some\nmarshmallow and jujube lozenges.  The under-governors and the first valet\nde chambre requested her not to give the Dauphin anything, as he was to\nreceive no food of any kind without the consent of the faculty.\nI forbear to describe the wound this prohibition inflicted upon the\nQueen; she felt it the more deeply because she was aware it was unjustly\nbelieved she gave a decided preference to the Duc de Normandie, whose\nruddy health and amiability did, in truth, form a striking contrast to\nthe languid look and melancholy disposition of his elder brother.  She\neven suspected that a plot had for some time existed to deprive her of\nthe affection of a child whom she loved as a good and tender mother\nought.  Previous to the audience granted by the King on the 10th August,\n1788, to the envoy of the Sultan Tippoo Saib, she had begged the Duc\nd’Harcourt to divert the Dauphin, whose deformity was already apparent,\nfrom his, intention to be present at that ceremony, being unwilling to\nexpose him to the gaze of the crowd of inquisitive Parisians who would be\nin the gallery.  Notwithstanding this injunction, the Dauphin was\nsuffered to write to his mother, requesting her permission to be present\nat the audience.  The Queen was obliged to refuse him, and warmly\nreproached the governor, who merely answered that he could not oppose the\nwishes of a sick child.  A year before the death of the Dauphin the Queen\nlost the Princesse Sophie; this was, as the Queen said, the first of a\nseries of misfortunes.",
