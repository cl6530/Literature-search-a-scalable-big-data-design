        "The voluntary and enforced travels of the Jews produced, from the\nearliest period after the destruction of the Temple, an extensive, if\nfragmentary, geographical literature. In the Talmud and later religious\nbooks, in the Letters of the Gaonim, in the correspondence of Jewish\nambassadors, in the autobiographical narratives interspersed in the\nworks of all Jewish scholars of the Middle Ages, in the Aruch, or\nTalmudical Lexicon, of Nathan of Rome, in the satirical romances of the\npoetical globe-trotters, Zabara and Charizi, and, finally, in the Bible\ncommentaries written by Jews, many geographical notes are to be found.\nBut the composition of complete works dedicated to travel and\nexploration dates only from the twelfth century.",
        "Before that time, however, interest in the whereabouts of the Lost Ten\nTribes gave rise to a book which has been well called the Arabian Nights\nof the Jews. The “Diary of Eldad the Danite,” written in about the year\n880, was a popular romance, to which additions and alterations were made\nat various periods. This diary tells of mighty Israelite empires,\nespecially of the tribe of Moses, the peoples of which were all\nvirtuous, all happy, and long-lived.",
        "      “A river flows round their land for a distance of four\n     days’ journey on every side. They dwell in beautiful houses\n     provided with handsome towers, which they have built\n     themselves. There is nothing unclean among them, neither in\n     the case of birds, venison, nor domesticated animals; there\n     are no wild beasts, no flies, no foxes, no vermin, no\n     serpents, no dogs, and, in general, nothing that does harm;\n     they have only sheep and cattle, which bear twice a year.\n     They sow and reap, they have all kinds of gardens with all\n     kinds of fruits and cereals, beans, melons, gourds,\n     onions, garlic, wheat, and barley, and the seed grows a\n     hundredfold. They have faith; they know the Law, the\n     Mishnah, the Talmud, and the Hagadah.... No child, be it\n     son or daughter, dies during the life-time of its parents,\n     but they reach a third and fourth generation. They do all\n     the field-work themselves, having no male nor female\n     servants. They do not close their houses at night, for\n     there is no thief or evil-doer among them. They have plenty\n     of gold and silver; they sow flax, and cultivate the\n     crimson-worm, and make beautiful garments.... The river\n     Sambatyon is two hundred yards broad, about as far as a\n     bow-shot. It is full of sand and stones, but without water;\n     the stones make a great noise, like the waves of the sea\n     and a stormy wind, so that in the night the noise is heard\n     at a distance of half a day’s journey. There are fish in\n     it, and all kinds of clean birds fly round it. And this\n     river of stone and sand rolls during the six working-days,\n     and rests on the Sabbath day. As soon as the Sabbath\n     begins, fire surrounds the river, and the flames remain\n     till the next evening, when the Sabbath ends. Thus no human\n     being can reach the river for a distance of half a mile on\n     either side; the fire consumes all that grows there.”",
        "With wild rapture the Jews of the ninth century heard of these\nprosperous and powerful kingdoms. Hopes of a restoration to former\ndignity encouraged them to believe in the mythical narrative of Eldad.\nIt is doubtful whether he was a bona fide traveller. At all events,\nhis book includes much that became the legendary property of all peoples\nin the Middle Ages, such as the fable of the mighty Christian Emperor of\nIndia, Prester John.",
        "Some further account of this semi-mythical monarch is contained in the\nfirst real Jewish traveller’s book, the “Itinerary” of Benjamin of\nTudela. This Benjamin was a merchant, who, in the year 1160, started on\na long journey, which was prompted partly by commercial, partly by\nscientific motives. He visited a large part of Europe and Asia, went to\nJerusalem and Bagdad, and gives in his “Itinerary” some remarkable\ngeographical facts and some equally remarkable fables. He tells, for\ninstance, the story of the pretended Messiah, David Alroy, whom Disraeli\nmade the hero of one of his romances. Benjamin of Tudela’s “Itinerary\"\nwas a real contribution to geography.",
        "Soon after Benjamin, another Jew, Petachiah of Ratisbon, set out on a\nsimilar but less extended tour, which occupied him during the years 1179\nand 1180. His “Travels” are less informing than those of his immediate\npredecessor, but his descriptions of the real or reputed sepulchres of\nancient worthies and his account of the Jewish College in Bagdad are\nfull of romantic interest, which was not lessened for medieval readers\nbecause much of Petachiah’s narrative was legendary.",
        "A far more important work was written by the first Jewish explorer of\nPalestine, Esthori Parchi, a contemporary of Mandeville. His family\noriginated in Florenza, in Andalusia, and the family name Parchi (the\nFlower) was derived from this circumstance. Esthori was himself born in\nProvence, and was a student of science as well as of the Talmud. When\nhe, together with the rest of the Jews of France, was exiled in 1306, he\nwandered to Spain and Egypt until the attraction of the Holy Land\nproved irresistible. His manner was careful, and his love of accuracy\nunusual for his day. Hence, he was not content to collect all ancient\nand contemporary references to the sites of Palestine. For seven years\nhe devoted himself to a personal exploration of the country, two years\nbeing passed in Galilee. In 1322 he completed his work, which he called\nKaphtor va-Pherach (Bunch and Flower) in allusion to his own name.",
        "Access to the Holy Land became easier for Jews in the fourteenth\ncentury. Before that time the city of Jerusalem had for a considerable\nperiod been barred to Jewish pilgrims. By the laws of Constantine and of\nOmar no Jew might enter within the precincts of his ancient capital.\nEven in the centuries subsequent to Omar, such pilgrimages were fraught\nwith danger, but the poems of Jehuda Halevi, the tolerance of Islam, and\nthe reputation of Northern Syria as a centre of the Kabbala, combined\nto draw many Jews to Palestine. Many letters and narratives were the\nresults. One characteristic specimen must suffice. In 1488 Obadiah of\nBertinoro, author of the most popular commentary on the Mishnah, removed\nfrom Italy to Jerusalem, where he was appointed Rabbi. In a letter to\nhis father he gives an intensely moving account of his voyage and of the\nstate of Hebron and Zion. The narrative is full of personal detail, and\nis marked throughout by deep love for his father, which struggles for\nthe mastery with his love for the Holy City.",
        "A more ambitious work was the “Itinera Mundi” of Abraham Farissol,\nwritten in the autumn of 1524. This treatise was based upon original\nresearches as well as on the works of Christian and Arabian geographers.\nHe incidentally says a good deal about the condition of the Jews in\nvarious parts of the world. Indeed, almost all the geographical\nwritings of Jews are social histories of their brethren in faith.\nSomewhat later, David Reubeni published some strange stories as to the\nJews. He went to Rome, where he made a considerable sensation, and was\nreceived by Pope Clement VII (1523-1534). Dwarfish in stature and dark\nin complexion, David Reubeni was wasted by continual fasting, but his\nmanner, though harsh and forbidding, was intrepid and awe-inspiring. His\noutrageous falsehoods for a time found ready acceptance with Jews and\nChristians alike, and his fervid Messianism won over to his cause many\nMarranos–Jews who had been forced by the Inquisition in Spain to assume\nthe external garb of Christianity. His chief claim on the memory of\nposterity was his connection with the dramatic career of Solomon Molcho\n(1501-1532), a youth noble in mind and body, who at Reubeni’s\ninstigation personated the Messiah, and in early manhood died a martyr’s\ndeath amid the flames of the Inquisition at Mantua.",
        "The geographical literature of the Jews did not lose its association\nwith Messianic hopes. Antonio de Montesinos, in 1642, imagined that he\nhad discovered in South America the descendants of the Ten Tribes. He\nhad been led abroad by business considerations and love of travel, and\nin Brazil came across a mestizo Indian, from whose statements he\nconceived the firm belief that the Ten Tribes resided and thrived in\nBrazil. Two years later he visited Amsterdam, and, his imagination\naflame with the hopes which had not been stifled by several years’\nendurance of the prisons and tortures of the Inquisition, persuaded\nManasseh ben Israel to accept his statements. On his death-bed in\nBrazil, Montesinos reiterated his assertions, and Manasseh ben Israel\nnot only founded thereon his noted book, “The Hope of Israel,” but under\nthe inspiration of similar ideas felt impelled to visit London, and win\nfrom Cromwell the right of the Jews to resettle in England.",
        "Jewish geographical literature grew apace in the eighteenth century. A\nfamous book, the “Work of Tobiah,” was written at the beginning of this\nperiod by Tobiah Cohen, who was born at Metz in 1652, and died in\nJerusalem in 1729. It is a medley of science and fiction, an\nencyclopedia dealing with all branches of knowledge. He had studied at\nthe Universities of Frankfort and Padua, had enjoyed the patronage of\nthe Elector of Brandenburg, and his medical knowledge won him many\ndistinguished patients in Constantinople. Thus his work contains many\nmedical chapters of real value, and he gives one of the earliest\naccounts of recently discovered drugs and medicinal plants. Among other\ncuriosities he maintained that he had discovered the Pygmies.",
        "From this absorbing but confusing book our survey must turn finally to\nN.H. Wessely, who in 1782 for the first time maintained the importance\nof the study of geography in Jewish school education. The works of the\npast, with their consoling legends and hopes, continued to hold a place\nin the heart of Jewish readers. But from Wessely’s time onwards a long\nseries of Jewish explorers and travellers have joined the ranks of those\nwho have opened up for modern times a real knowledge of the globe.",
