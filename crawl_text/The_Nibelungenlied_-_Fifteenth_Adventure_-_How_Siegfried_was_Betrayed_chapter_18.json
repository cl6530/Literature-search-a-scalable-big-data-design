        "Upon the fourth morning / two and thirty men\nSaw ye to court a-riding. / Unto King Gunther then\nWere tidings borne that ready / he should make for foe–\nThis lie did bring to women / many, anon full grievous woe.",
        "878",
        "Leave had they ’fore the monarch’s / presence to appear,\nThere to give themselves out / for men of Luedeger,\nHim erstwhile was conquered / by Siegfried’s doughty hand\nAnd brought a royal hostage / bound unto King Gunther’s land.",
        "879",
        "The messengers he greeted / and to seat them gave command.\nThen spake one amongst them: / “Allow that yet we stand\nUntil we tell the tidings / that to thee are sent.\nKnow thou that warriors many / on thee to wreak their hate are bent.",
        "880",
        "“Defiance bids thee Luedegast / and eke Luedeger\nWho at thy hands full sorely / erstwhile aggrieved were:\nIn this thy land with hostile / host they’ll soon appear.\"\nTo rage begin the monarch / when such tidings he did hear.",
        "881",
        "Those who did act thus falsely / they bade to lodge the while.\nHow himself might Siegfried / guard against such guile\nAs there they planned against him, / he or ever one?\nUnto themselves ’twas sorrow / great anon that e’er ’twas done.",
        "882",
        "With his friends the monarch / secret counsel sought.\nHagen of Tronje / let him tarry not.\nOf the king’s men yet were many / who fain would peace restore:\nBut nowise would Hagen / his dark purpose e’er give o’er.",
        "883",
        "Upon a day came Siegfried / when they did counsel take,\nAnd there the knight of Netherland / thus unto them spake:\n“How goeth now so sorrowful / amid his men the king?\nI’ll help you to avenge it, / hath he been wronged in anything.”",
        "884",
        "Then spake the monarch Gunther: / “Of right do I lament,\nLuedegast and Luedeger / have hostile message sent:\nThey will in open manner / now invade my land.\"\nThe knight full keen gave answer: / “That in sooth shall Siegfried’s\n      hand,",
        "885",
        "“As doth befit thy honor, / know well to turn aside.\nAs erstwhile to thy enemies, / shall now from me betide:\nTheir lands and eke their castles / laid waste by me shall be\nEre that I give over: / thereof my head be surety.",
        "886",
        "“Thou and thy good warriors / shall here at home abide,\nAnd let me with my company / alone against them ride.\nThat I do serve thee gladly, / that will I let them see;\nBy me shall thy enemies, / –that know thou– full requited be.”",
        "887",
        "“Good tidings, that thou sayest,\" / then the monarch said,\nAs if he in earnest / did joy to have such aid.\nDeep did bow before him / the king in treachery.\nThen spake Sir Siegfried: / “Bring that but little care to thee.”",
        "888",
        "Then serving-men full many / bade they ready be:\n’Twas done alone that Siegfried / and his men the same might see.\nThen bade he make them ready / the knights of Netherland,\nAnd soon did Siegfried’s warriors / for fight apparelled ready stand.",
        "889",
        "“My royal father Siegmund, / here shalt thou remain,\"\nSpake then Sir Siegfried. / “We come full soon again\nIf God but give good fortune, / hither the Rhine beside;\nHere shalt thou with King Gunther / full merrily the while abide.”",
        "890",
        "Then bound they on the banners / as they thence would fare.\nMen of royal Gunther / were full many there,\nWho naught knew of the matter, / or how that thing might be:\nThere with Siegfried saw ye / of knights a mickle company.",
        "891",
        "Their helms and eke their mail-coats / bound on horse did stand:\nAnd doughty knights made ready / to fare from out that land.\nThen went of Tronje Hagen / where he Kriemhild found\nAnd prayed a fair leave-taking, / for that to battle they were bound.",
        "892",
        "“Now well is me, such husband / I have,” Kriemhild said,\n“That to my loving kindred / can bring so potent aid,\nAs my lord Siegfried / doth now to friends of me.\nThereby,” spake the high lady, / “may I full joyous-minded be.",
        "893",
        "“Now full dear friend Hagen, / call thou this to mind,\nGood-will I e’er have borne thee, / nor hate in any kind.\nLet now therefrom have profit / the husband dear to me.\nIf Brunhild aught I’ve injured / may’t not to him requited be.",
        "894",
        "“For that I since have suffered,\" / spake the high lady.\n“Sore punishment hath offered / therefor the knight to me.\nThat I have aught e’er spoken / to make her sad of mood,\nVengeance well hath taken / on me the valiant knight and good.”",
        "895",
        "“In the days hereafter shall ye / be reconciled full well.\nKriemhild, beloved lady, / to me shalt thou tell\nHow that in Siegfried’s person / I may service do to thee.\nThat do I gladly, lady, / and unto none more willingly.”",
        "896",
        "“No longer were I fearful,\" / spake his noble wife,\n“That e’er in battle any / should take from him his life,\nWould he but cease to follow / his high undaunted mood:\nSecure were then forever / the thane full valiant and good.”",
        "897",
        "“Lady,” spake then Hagen, / “an hast thou e’er a fear\nThat hostile blade should pierce him, / now shalt thou give to hear\nWith what arts of cunning / I may the same prevent.\nOn horse and foot to guard him / shall ever be my fair intent.”",
        "898",
        "She spake: “Of my kin art thou, / as I eke of thine.\nIn truth to thee commended / be then dear spouse of mine,\nThat him well thou guardest / whom full dear I hold.\"\nShe told to him a story / ’twere better had she left untold.",
        "899",
        "She spake: “A valorous husband / is mine, and doughty too.\nWhen he the worm-like dragon / by the mountain slew,\nIn its blood the stately / knight himself then bathed,\nSince when from cutting weapons / in battle is he all unscathed.",
        "900",
        "“Nathless my heart is troubled / when he in fight doth stand,\nAnd full many a spear-shaft / is hurled by hero’s hand,\nLest that I a husband / full dear should see no more.\nAlack! How oft for Siegfried / must I sit in sorrow sore!",
        "901",
        "“On thy good-will I rest me, / dear friend, to tell to thee,\nAnd that thy faith thou fully / provest now to me,\nWhere that my spouse may smitten / be by hand of foe.\nThis I now shall tell thee, / and on thy honor this I do.",
        "902",
        "“When from the wounded dragon / reeking flowed the blood,\nAnd therein did bathe him / the valiant knight and good,\nFell down between his shoulders / full broad a linden leaf.\nThere may he be smitten; / ’tis cause to me of mickle grief.’",
        "903",
        "Then spake of Tronje Hagen: / “Upon his tunic sew\nThou a little token. / Thereby shall I know\nWhere I may protect him / when in the fight we strain.\"\nShe weened to save the hero, / yet wrought she nothing save his bane.",
        "904",
        "She spake: “All fine and silken / upon his coat I’ll sew\nA little cross full secret. / There, doughty thane, shalt thou\nFrom my knight ward danger / when battle rageth sore,\nAnd when amid the turmoil / he stands his enemies before.”",
        "905",
        "“That will I do,” quoth Hagen, / “lady full dear to me.\"\nThen weened eke the lady / it should his vantage be,\nBut there alone did Kriemhild / her own good knight betray.\nLeave of her took Hagen, / and joyously he went away.",
        "906",
        "The followers of the monarch / were all of merry mood.\nI ween that knight thereafter / never any could\nOf treachery be guilty / such as then was he\nWhen that Queen Kriemhild / did rest on his fidelity.",
        "907",
        "With his men a thousand / upon the following day\nRode thence Sir Siegfried / full joyously away.\nHe weened he should take vengeance / for harm his friends did bear.\nThat he might view the tunic / Hagen rode to him full near.",
        "908",
        "When he had viewed the token / sent Hagen thence away\nTwo of his men in secret / who did other tidings say:\nHow that King Gunther’s country / had nothing now to fear\nAnd that unto the monarch / had sent them royal Luedeger.",
        "909",
        "’Twas little joy to Siegfried / that he must turn again\nEre for the hostile menace / vengeance he had ta’en.\nIn sooth the men of Gunther / could scarce his purpose bend.\nThen rode he to the monarch, / who thus began his thanks to lend:",
        "910",
        "“Now God reward thee for it, / my good friend Siegfried,\nThat thou with mind so willing / hast holpen me in need.\nThat shall I e’er repay thee, / as I may do of right.\nTo thee before all other / friends do I my service plight.",
        "911",
        "“Now that from battle-journey / free we are once more,\nSo will I ride a-hunting / the wild bear and the boar\nAway to the Vosges forest, / as I full oft have done.\"\nThe same had counselled Hagen, / the full dark and faithless man.",
        "912",
        "“To all my guests here with me / shall now be told\nThat we ride forth at daybreak: / themselves shall ready hold,\nWho will join the hunting; / will any here remain\nFor pastime with fair ladies, / the thing behold I eke full fain.”",
        "913",
        "Then outspake Sir Siegfried / as in manner due:\n“If that thou rid’st a-hunting, / go I gladly too.\nA huntsman shalt thou grant me / and good hound beside\nThat shall the game discover; / so with thee to the green I’ll ride.”",
        "914",
        "Straightway spake the monarch: / “Wilt thou but one alone?\nAnd wilt thou, four I’ll grant thee, / to whom full well is known\nThe forest with the runways / where most the game doth stray,\nAnd who unto the camp-fires / will help thee back to find thy way.”",
        "915",
        "Unto his spouse then rode he, / the gallant knight and bold.\nFull soon thereafter Hagen / unto the king had told\nHow he within his power / would have the noble thane:\nMay deed so dark and faithless / ne’er by knight be done again!",
