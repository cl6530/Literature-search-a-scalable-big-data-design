        "During the hot weather very few crowns are worn this season, and a few\nhints as to the care of the crown itself may not be out of place.",
        "The crown should not be carelessly hung on the hat rack in the royal hall\nfor the flies to roost upon, but it should be thoroughly cleaned and put\naway as soon as the weather becomes too hot to wear it comfortably.",
        "Great care should be used in cleaning a gold-plated crown, to avoid\nwearing out the plate. Take a good stiff tooth brush, with a little\nsoapsuds, and clean the crown thoroughly at first, drying it on a clean\ntowel and taking care not to drop it on the floor and thus knock the\nmoss-agate diadem loose. Next, get a sleeve of the royal undershirt, or,\nin case you can not procure one readily, the sleeve of a duke or\nright-bower may be used. Soak this in vinegar, and, with a coat of\nwhiting, polish the crown thoroughly, wrap it in cotton-flannel and put in\nthe bureau. Sometimes, the lining of the crown becomes saturated with\nhair-oil from constant use and needs cleaning. In such cases the lining\nmay be removed, boiled in concentrated lye two hours, or until tender, and\nthen placed on the grass to bleach in the sun.",
        "Most crowns are size six-and-seven-eights, and they are therefore\nfrequently too large for the number six head of royalty. In such cases a\nnewspaper may be folded lengthwise and laid inside the sweat-band of the\ncrown, thus reducing the size and preventing any accident by which his or\nher majesty might lose the crown in the coal-bin while doing chores.",
        "After the Fourth of July and other royal holidays, this newspaper may be\nremoved, and the crown will be found none too large for the imperial dome\nof thought.",
        "Sceptres may be cleaned and wrapped in woolen goods during the hot months.\nThe leg of an old pair of pantaloons makes a good retort to run a sceptre\ninto while not in use. Never try to kill flies or drive carpet tacks with\nthe sceptre. It is an awkward tool at best, and you might ’easily knock a\nthumb nail loose. Great care should also be taken of the royal robe. Do\nnot use it for a lap robe while dining, nor sleep in it at night. Nothing\nlooks more repugnant than a king on the throne, with little white feathers\nall over his robe.",
        "It is equally bad taste to govern a kingdom in a maroon robe with white\nhorse hairs all over it.",
        "I once knew a king who invariably curried his horses in his royal robes;\nand if the steeds didn’t stand around to suit him, he would ever and anon\nwelt them in the pit of the stomach with his cast-iron sceptre. It was\ngreatly to the interest of his horses not to incur the royal displeasure,\nas the reader has no doubt already surmised.",
        "The robe of the king should only be worn while his majesty is on the\nthrone. When he comes down at night, after his day’s work, and goes out\nafter his coal and kindling-wood, he may take off his robe, roll it up\ncarefully, and stick it under the throne, where it will be out of sight.\nNothing looks more untidy than a fat king milking a bobtail cow in a\nMother Hubbard robe trimmed with imitation ermine.",
