        "“Heidi” is a delightful story for children of life in the Alps,\none of many tales written by the Swiss authoress, Johanna Spyri,\nwho died in her home at Zurich in 1891. She had been well known\nto the younger readers of her own country since 1880, when she\npublished her story, Heimathlos, which ran into three or more\neditions, and which, like her other books, as she states on the\ntitle page, was written for those who love children, as well as\nfor the youngsters themselves. Her own sympathy with the\ninstincts and longings of the child’s heart is shown in her\npicture of Heidi. The record of the early life of this Swiss\nchild amid the beauties of her passionately loved mountain-home\nand during her exile in the great town has been for many years a\nfavorite book of younger readers in Germany and America.",
        "Madame Spyri, like Hans Andersen, had by temperament a peculiar\nskill in writing the simple histories of an innocent world. In\nall her stories she shows an underlying desire to preserve\nchildren alike from misunderstanding and the mistaken kindness\nthat frequently hinder the happiness and natural development of\ntheir lives and characters. The authoress, as we feel in reading\nher tales, lived among the scenes and people she describes, and\nthe setting of her stories has the charm of the mountain scenery\namid which she places her small actors.",
        "Her chief works, besides Heidi, were:– Am Sonntag; Arthur und\nSquirrel; Aus dem Leben; Aus den Schweizer Bergen; Aus Nah und\nFern; Aus unserem, Lande; Cornelli wird erzogen; Einer vom Hause\nLesa; 10 Geschichten fur Yung und Alt; Kurze Geschichten, 2\nvols.; Gritli’s Kinder, 2 vols.; Heimathlos; Im Tilonethal; In\nLeuchtensa; Keiner zu Klein Helfer zu sein; Onkel Titus; Schloss\nWildenstein; Sina; Ein Goldener Spruch; Die Hauffer Muhle;\nVerschollen, nicht vergessen; Was soll deim aus ihr werden; Was\naus ihr Geworden ist.     M.E.",
        "From the old and pleasantly situated village of Mayenfeld, a\nfootpath winds through green and shady meadows to the foot of\nthe mountains, which on this side look down from their stern and\nlofty heights upon the valley below. The land grows gradually\nwilder as the path ascends, and the climber has not gone far\nbefore he begins to inhale the fragrance of the short grass and\nsturdy mountain-plants, for the way is steep and leads directly\nup to the summits above.",
        "On a clear sunny morning in June two figures might be seen\nclimbing the narrow mountain path; one, a tall strong-looking\ngirl, the other a child whom she was leading by the hand, and\nwhose little checks were so aglow with heat that the crimson\ncolor could be seen even through the dark, sunburnt skin. And\nthis was hardly to be wondered at, for in spite of the hot June\nsun the child was clothed as if to keep off the bitterest frost.\nShe did not look more than five years old, if as much, but what\nher natural figure was like, it would have been hard to say, for\nshe had apparently two, if not three dresses, one above the\nother, and over these a thick red woollen shawl wound round\nabout her, so that the little body presented a shapeless\nappearance, as, with its small feet shod in thick, nailed\nmountain-shoes, it slowly and laboriously plodded its way up in\nthe heat. The two must have left the valley a good hour’s walk\nbehind them, when they came to the hamlet known as Dorfli, which\nis situated half-way up the mountain. Here the wayfarers met with\ngreetings from all sides, some calling to them from windows, some\nfrom open doors, others from outside, for the elder girl was now\nin her old home. She did not, however, pause in her walk to\nrespond to her friends’ welcoming cries and questions, but passed\non without stopping for a moment until she reached the last of\nthe scattered houses of the hamlet. Here a voice called to her\nfrom the door: “Wait a moment, Dete; if you are going up higher,\nI will come with you.”",
        "The girl thus addressed stood still, and the child immediately\nlet go her hand and seated herself on the ground.",
        "“Are you tired, Heidi?” asked her companion.",
        "“No, I am hot,” answered the child.",
        "“We shall soon get to the top now. You must walk bravely on a\nlittle longer, and take good long steps, and in another hour we\nshall be there,” said Dete in an encouraging voice.",
        "They were now joined by a stout, good-natured-looking woman, who\nwalked on ahead with her old acquaintance, the two breaking\nforth at once into lively conversation about everybody and\neverything in Dorfli and its surroundings, while the child\nwandered behind them.",
        "“And where are you off to with the child?” asked the one who had\njust joined the party. “I suppose it is the child your sister\nleft?”",
        "“Yes,” answered Dete. “I am taking her up to Uncle, where she\nmust stay.”",
        "“The child stay up there with Alm-Uncle! You must be out of your\nsenses, Dete! How can you think of such a thing! The old man,\nhowever, will soon send you and your proposal packing off home\nagain!”",
        "“He cannot very well do that, seeing that he is her grandfather.\nHe must do something for her. I have had the charge of the child\ntill now, and I can tell you, Barbel, I am not going to give up\nthe chance which has just fallen to me of getting a good place,\nfor her sake. It is for the grandfather now to do his duty by\nher.”",
        "“That would be all very well if he were like other people,\"\nasseverated stout Barbel warmly, “but you know what he is. And\nwhat can he do with a child, especially with one so young! The\nchild cannot possibly live with him. But where are you thinking\nof going yourself?”",
        "“To Frankfurt, where an extra good place awaits me,” answered\nDete. “The people I am going to were down at the Baths last\nsummer, and it was part of my duty to attend upon their rooms.\nThey would have liked then to take me away with them, but I\ncould not leave. Now they are there again and have repeated their\noffer, and I intend to go with them, you may make up your mind\nto that!”",
        "“I am glad I am not the child!” exclaimed Barbel, with a gesture\nof horrified pity. “Not a creature knows anything about the old\nman up there! He will have nothing to do with anybody, and never\nsets his foot inside a church from one year’s end to another.\nWhen he does come down once in a while, everybody clears out of\nthe way of him and his big stick. The mere sight of him, with\nhis bushy grey eyebrows and his immense beard, is alarming\nenough. He looks like any old heathen or Indian, and few would\ncare to meet him alone.”",
        "“Well, and what of that?” said Dete, in a defiant voice, “he is\nthe grandfather all the same, and must look after the child. He\nis not likely to do her any harm, and if he does, he will be\nanswerable for it, not I.”",
        "“I should very much like to know,” continued Barbel, in an\ninquiring tone of voice, “what the old man has on his conscience\nthat he looks as he does, and lives up there on the mountain\nlike a hermit, hardly ever allowing himself to be seen. All kinds\nof things are said about him. You, Dete, however, must certainly\nhave learnt a good deal concerning him from your sister–am I\nnot right?”",
        "“You are right, I did, but I am not going to repeat what I\nheard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble\nabout it.”",
        "Now Barbel had for long past been most anxious to ascertain\nparticulars about Alm-Uncle, as she could not understand why he\nseemed to feel such hatred towards his fellow-creatures, and\ninsisted on living all alone, or why people spoke about him half\nin whispers, as if afraid to say anything against him, and yet\nunwilling to take his Part. Moreover, Barbel was in ignorance as\nto why all the people in Dorfli called him Alm-Uncle, for he\ncould not possibly be uncle to everybody living there. As,\nhowever, it was the custom, she did like the rest and called the\nold man Uncle. Barbel had only lived in Dorfli since her\nmarriage, which had taken place not long before. Previous to\nthat her home had been below in Prattigau, so that she was not\nwell acquainted with all the events that had ever taken place,\nand with all the people who had ever lived in Dorfli and its\nneighborhood. Dete, on the contrary, had been born in Dorfli,\nand had lived there with her mother until the death of the latter\nthe year before, and had then gone over to the Baths at Ragatz\nand taken service in the large hotel there as chambermaid. On the\nmorning of this day she had come all the way from Ragatz with\nthe child, a friend having given them a lift in a hay-cart as far\nas Mayenfeld. Barbel was therefore determined not to lose this\ngood opportunity of satisfying her curiosity. She put her arm\nthrough Dete’s in a confidential sort of way, and said: “I know I\ncan find out the real truth from you, and the meaning of all\nthese tales that are afloat about him. I believe you know the\nwhole story. Now do just tell me what is wrong with the old man,\nand if he was always shunned as he is now, and was always such a\nmisanthrope.”",
        "“How can I possibly tell you whether he was always the same,\nseeing I am only six-and-twenty and he at least seventy years of\nage; so you can hardly expect me to know much about his youth.\nIf I was sure, however, that what I tell you would not go the\nwhole round of Prattigau, I could relate all kinds of things\nabout him; my mother came from Domleschg, and so did he.”",
        "“Nonsense, Dete, what do you mean?” replied Barbel, somewhat\noffended, “gossip has not reached such a dreadful pitch in\nPrattigau as all that, and I am also quite capable of holding my\ntongue when it is necessary.”",
        "“Very well then, I will tell you–but just wait a moment,” said\nDete in a warning voice, and she looked back to make sure that\nthe child was not near enough to hear all she was going to\nrelate; but the child was nowhere to be seen, and must have\nturned aside from following her companions some time before,\nwhile these were too eagerly occupied with their conversation to\nnotice it. Dete stood still and looked around her in all\ndirections. The footpath wound a little here and there, but\ncould nevertheless be seen along its whole length nearly to\nDorfli; no one, however, was visible upon it at this moment.",
        "“I see where she is,” exclaimed Barbel, “look over there!” and\nshe pointed to a spot far away from the footpath. “She is\nclimbing up the slope yonder with the goatherd and his goats. I\nwonder why he is so late to-day bringing them up. It happens\nwell, however, for us, for he can now see after the child, and\nyou can the better tell me your tale.”",
        "“Oh, as to the looking after,” remarked Dete, “the boy need not\nput himself out about that; she is not by any means stupid for\nher five years, and knows how to use her eyes. She notices all\nthat is going on, as I have often had occasion to remark, and\nthis will stand her in good stead some day, for the old man has\nnothing beyond his two goats and his hut.”",
        "“Did he ever have more?” asked Barbel.",
        "“He? I should think so indeed,” replied Dete with animation; “he\nwas owner once of one of the largest farms in Domleschg. He was\nthe elder of two brothers; the younger was a quiet, orderly man,\nbut nothing would please the other but to play the grand\ngentleman and go driving about the country and mixing with bad\ncompany, strangers that nobody knew. He drank and gambled away\nthe whole of his property, and when this became known to his\nmother and father they died, one shortly after the other, of\nsorrow. The younger brother, who was also reduced to beggary,\nwent off in his anger, no one knew whither, while Uncle himself,\nhaving nothing now left to him but his bad name, also\ndisappeared. For some time his whereabouts were unknown, then\nsome one found out that he had gone to Naples as a soldier;\nafter that nothing more was heard of him for twelve or fifteen\nyears. At the end of that time he reappeared in Domleschg,\nbringing with him a young child, whom he tried to place with some\nof his kinspeople. Every door, however, was shut in his face, for\nno one wished to have any more to do with him. Embittered by this\ntreatment, he vowed never to set foot in Domleschg again, and he\nthen came to Dorfli, where he continued to live with his little\nboy. His wife was probably a native of the Grisons, whom he had\nmet down there, and who died soon after their marriage. He could\nnot have been entirely without money, for he apprenticed his\nson, Tobias, to a carpenter. He was a steady lad, and kindly\nreceived by every one in Dorfli. The old man was, however, still\nlooked upon with suspicion, and it was even rumoured that he had\nbeen forced to make his escape from Naples, or it might have gone\nbadly with him, for that he had killed a man, not in fair fight,\nyou understand, but in some brawl. We, however, did not refuse\nto acknowledge our relationship with him, my great-grandmother on\nmy mother’s side having been sister to his grandmother. So we\ncalled him Uncle, and as through my father we are also related to\nnearly every family in Dorfli, he became known all over the place\nas Uncle, and since he went to live on the mountain side he has\ngone everywhere by the name of Alm-Uncle.”",
        "“And what happened to Tobias?” asked Barbel, who was listening\nwith deep interest.",
        "“Wait a moment, I am coming to that, but I cannot tell you\neverything at once,” replied Dete. “Tobias was taught his trade\nin Mels, and when he had served his apprenticeship he came back\nto Dorfli and married my sister Adelaide. They had always been\nfond of one another, and they got on very well together after\nthey were married. But their happiness did not last long. Her\nhusband met with his death only two years after their marriage,\na beam falling upon him as he was working, and killing him on the\nspot. They carried him home, and when Adelaide saw the poor\ndisfigured body of her husband she was so overcome with horror\nand grief that she fell into a fever from which she never\nrecovered. She had always been rather delicate and subject to\ncurious attacks, during which no one knew whether she was awake\nor sleeping. And so two months after Tobias had been carried to\nthe grave, his wife followed him. Their sad fate was the talk of\neverybody far and near, and both in private and public the\ngeneral opinion was expressed that it was a punishment which\nUncle had deserved for the godless life he had led. Some went so\nfar even as to tell him so to his face. Our minister endeavored\nto awaken his conscience and exhorted him to repentance, but the\nold man grew only more wrathful and obdurate and would not speak\nto a soul, and every one did their best to keep out of his way.\nAll at once we heard that he had gone to live up the Alm and did\nnot intend ever to come down again, and since then he has led\nhis solitary life on the mountain side at enmity with God and\nman. Mother and I took Adelaide’s little one, then only a year\nold, into our care. When mother died last year, and I went down\nto the Baths to earn some money, I paid old Ursel, who lives in\nthe village just above, to keep and look after the child. I\nstayed on at the Baths through the winter, for as I could sew and\nknit I had no difficulty in finding plenty of work, and early in\nthe spring the same family I had waited on before returned from\nFrankfurt, and again asked me to go back with them. And so we\nleave the day after to-morrow, and I can assure you, it is an\nexcellent place for me.”",
        "“And you are going to give the child over to the old man up\nthere? It surprises me beyond words that you can think of doing\nsuch a thing, Dete,” said Barbel, in a voice full of reproach.",
        "“What do you mean?” retorted Dete. “I have done my duty by the\nchild, and what would you have me do with it now? I cannot\ncertainly take a child of five years old with me to Frankfurt.\nBut where are you going to yourself, Barbel; we are now half way\nup the Alm?”",
        "“We have just reached the place I wanted,” answered Barbel. “I\nhad something to say to the goatherd’s wife, who does some\nspinning for me in the winter. So good-bye, Dete, and good luck\nto you!”",
        "Dete shook hands with her friend and remained standing while\nBarbel went towards a small, dark brown hut, which stood a few\nsteps away from the path in a hollow that afforded it some\nprotection from the mountain wind. The hut was situated half way\nup the Alm, reckoning from Dorfli, and it was well that it was\nprovided with some shelter, for it was so broken-down and\ndilapidated that even then it must have been very unsafe as a\nhabitation, for when the stormy south wind came sweeping over\nthe mountain, everything inside it, doors and windows, shook and\nrattled, and all the rotten old beams creaked and trembled. On\nsuch days as this, had the goatherd’s dwelling been standing\nabove on the exposed mountain side, it could not have escaped\nbeing blown straight down into the valley without a moment’s\nwarning.",
        "Here lived Peter, the eleven-year-old boy, who every morning\nwent down to Dorfli to fetch his goats and drive them up on to\nthe mountain, where they were free to browse till evening on the\ndelicious mountain plants.",
        "Then Peter, with his light-footed animals, would go running and\nleaping down the mountain again till he reached Dorfli, and\nthere he would give a shrill whistle through his fingers,\nwhereupon all the owners of the goats would come out to fetch\nhome the animals that belonged to them. It was generally the\nsmall boys and girls who ran in answer to Peter’s whistle, for\nthey were none of them afraid of the gentle goats, and this was\nthe only hour of the day through all the summer months that Peter\nhad any opportunity of seeing his young friends, since the rest\nof his time was spent alone with the goats. He had a mother and a\nblind grandmother at home, it is true, but he was always obliged\nto start off very early in the morning, and only got home late in\nthe evening from Dorfli, for he always stayed as long as he could\ntalking and playing with the other children; and so he had just\ntime enough at home, and that was all, to swallow down his bread\nand milk in the morning, and again in the evening to get through\na similar meal, lie down in bed and go to sleep. His father, who\nhad been known also as the goatherd, having earned his living as\nsuch when younger, had been accidentally killed while cutting\nwood some years before. His mother, whose real name was Brigitta,\nwas always called the goatherd’s wife, for the sake of old\nassociation, while the blind grandmother was just “grandmother\"\nto all the old and young in the neighborhood.",
        "Dete had been standing for a good ten minutes looking about her\nin every direction for some sign of the children and the goats.\nNot a glimpse of them, however, was to be seen, so she climbed\nto a higher spot, whence she could get a fuller view of the\nmountain as it sloped beneath her to the valley, while, with\never-increasing anxiety on her face and in her movements, she\ncontinued to scan the surrounding slopes. Meanwhile the children\nwere climbing up by a far and roundabout way, for Peter knew\nmany spots where all kinds of good food, in the shape of shrubs\nand plants, grew for his goats, and he was in the habit of\nleading his flock aside from the beaten track. The child,\nexhausted with the heat and weight of her thick armor of clothes,\npanted and struggled after him at first with some difficulty. She\nsaid nothing, but her little eyes kept watching first Peter, as\nhe sprang nimbly hither and thither on his bare feet, clad only\nin his short light breeches, and then the slim-legged goats that\nwent leaping over rocks and shrubs and up the steep ascents with\neven greater ease. All at once she sat herself down on the\nground, and as fast as her little fingers could move, began\npulling off her shoes and stockings. This done she rose, unwound\nthe hot red shawl and threw it away, and then proceeded to undo\nher frock. It was off in a second, but there was still another\nto unfasten, for Dete had put the Sunday frock on over the\neveryday one, to save the trouble of carrying it. Quick as\nlightning the everyday frock followed the other, and now the\nchild stood up, clad only in her light short-sleeved under\ngarment, stretching out her little bare arms with glee. She put\nall her clothes together in a tidy little heap, and then went\njumping and climbing up after Peter and the goats as nimbly as\nany one of the party. Peter had taken no heed of what the child\nwas about when she stayed behind, but when she ran up to him in\nher new attire, his face broke into a grin, which grew broader\nstill as he looked back and saw the small heap of clothes lying\non the ground, until his mouth stretched almost from ear to ear;\nhe said nothing, however. The child, able now to move at her\nease, began to enter into conversation with Peter, who had many\nquestions to answer, for his companion wanted to know how many\ngoats he had, where he was going to with them, and what he had to\ndo when he arrived there. At last, after some time, they and the\ngoats approached the hut and came within view of Cousin Dete.\nHardly had the latter caught sight of the little company climbing\nup towards her when she shrieked out: “Heidi, what have you been\ndoing! What a sight you have made of yourself! And where are your\ntwo frocks and the red wrapper? And the new shoes I bought, and\nthe new stockings I knitted for you–everything gone! not a thing\nleft! What can you have been thinking of, Heidi; where are all\nyour clothes?”",
        "The child quietly pointed to a spot below on the mountain side\nand answered, “Down there.” Dete followed the direction of her\nfinger; she could just distinguish something lying on the\nground, with a spot of red on the top of it which she had no\ndoubt was the woollen wrapper.",
        "“You good-for-nothing little thing!” exclaimed Dete angrily,\n\"what could have put it into your head to do like that? What\nmade you undress yourself? What do you mean by it?”",
        "“I don’t want any clothes,” said the child, not showing any sign\nof repentance for her past deed.",
        "“You wretched, thoughtless child! have you no sense in you at\nall?” continued Dete, scolding and lamenting. “Who is going all\nthat way down to fetch them; it’s a good half-hour’s walk!\nPeter, you go off and fetch them for me as quickly as you can,\nand don’t stand there gaping at me, as if you were rooted to the\nground!”",
        "“I am already past my time,” answered Peter slowly, without\nmoving from the spot where he had been standing with his hands\nin his pockets, listening to Dete’s outburst of dismay and anger.",
        "“Well, you won’t get far if you only keep on standing there with\nyour eyes staring out of your head,” was Dete’s cross reply;\n\"but see, you shall have something nice,” and she held out a\nbright new piece of money to him that sparkled in the sun. Peter\nwas immediately up and off down the steep mountain side, taking\nthe shortest cut, and in an incredibly short space of time had\nreached the little heap of clothes, which he gathered up under\nhis arm, and was back again so quickly that even Dete was\nobliged to give him a word of praise as she handed him the\npromised money. Peter promptly thrust it into his pocket and his\nface beamed with delight, for it was not often that he was the\nhappy possessor of such riches.",
        "“You can carry the things up for me as far as Uncle’s, as you are\ngoing the same way,” went on Dete, who was preparing to continue\nher climb up the mountain side, which rose in a steep ascent\nimmediately behind the goatherd’s hut. Peter willingly undertook\nto do this, and followed after her on his bare feet, with his\nleft arm round the bundle and the right swinging his goatherd’s\nstick, while Heidi and the goats went skipping and jumping\njoyfully beside him. After a climb of more than three-quarters\nof an hour they reached the top of the Alm mountain. Uncle’s hut\nstood on a projection of the rock, exposed indeed to the winds,\nbut where every ray of sun could rest upon it, and a full view\ncould be had of the valley beneath. Behind the hut stood three\nold fir trees, with long, thick, unlopped branches. Beyond these\nrose a further wall of mountain, the lower heights still\novergrown with beautiful grass and plants, above which were\nstonier slopes, covered only with scrub, that led gradually up\nto the steep, bare rocky summits.",
        "Against the hut, on the side looking towards the valley, Uncle\nhad put up a seat. Here he was sitting, his pipe in his mouth\nand his hands on his knees, quietly looking out, when the\nchildren, the goats and Cousin Dete suddenly clambered into view.\nHeidi was at the top first. She went straight up to the old man,\nput out her hand, and said, “Good-evening, Grandfather.”",
        "“So, so, what is the meaning of this?” he asked gruffly, as he\ngave the child an abrupt shake of the hand, and gazed long and\nscrutinisingly at her from under his bushy eyebrows. Heidi\nstared steadily back at him in return with unflinching gaze, for\nthe grandfather, with his long beard and thick grey eyebrows that\ngrew together over his nose and looked just like a bush, was\nsuch a remarkable appearance, that Heidi was unable to take her\neyes off him. Meanwhile Dete had come up, with Peter after her,\nand the latter now stood still a while to watch what was going\non.",
        "“I wish you good-day, Uncle,” said Dete, as she walked towards\nhim, “and I have brought you Tobias and Adelaide’s child. You\nwill hardly recognise her, as you have never seen her since she\nwas a year old.”",
        "“And what has the child to do with me up here?” asked the old\nman curtly. “You there,” he then called out to Peter, “be off\nwith your goats, you are none too early as it is, and take mine\nwith you.”",
        "Peter obeyed on the instant and quickly disappeared, for the old\nman had given him a look that made him feel that he did not want\nto stay any longer.",
        "“The child is here to remain with you,” Dete made answer. “I\nhave, I think, done my duty by her for these four years, and now\nit is time for you to do yours.”",
        "“That’s it, is it?” said the old man, as he looked at her with a\nflash in his eye. “And when the child begins to fret and whine\nafter you, as is the way with these unreasonable little beings,\nwhat am I to do with her then?”",
        "“That’s your affair,” retorted Dete. “I know I had to put up\nwith her without complaint when she was left on my hands as an\ninfant, and with enough to do as it was for my mother and self.\nNow I have to go and look after my own earnings, and you are the\nnext of kin to the child. If you cannot arrange to keep her, do\nwith her as you like. You will be answerable for the result if\nharm happens to her, though you have hardly need, I should think,\nto add to the burden already on your conscience.”",
        "Now Dete was not quite easy in her own conscience about what she\nwas doing, and consequently was feeling hot and irritable, and\nsaid more than she had intended. As she uttered her last words,\nUncle rose from his seat. He looked at her in a way that made\nher draw back a step or two, then flinging out his arm, he said\nto her in a commanding voice: “Be off with you this instant, and\nget back as quickly as you can to the place whence you came, and\ndo not let me see your face again in a hurry.”",
        "Dete did not wait to be told twice. “Good-bye to you then, and\nto you too, Heidi,” she called, as she turned quickly away and\nstarted to descend the mountain at a running pace, which she did\nnot slacken till she found herself safely again at Dorfli, for\nsome inward agitation drove her forwards as if a steam-engine\nwas at work inside her. Again questions came raining down upon\nher from all sides, for every one knew Dete, as well as all\nparticulars of the birth and former history of the child, and\nall wondered what she had done with it. From every door and\nwindow came voices calling: “Where is the child?” “Where have you\nleft the child, Dete?” and more and more reluctantly Dete made\nanswer, “Up there with Alm-Uncle!” “With Alm-Uncle, have I not\ntold you so already?”",
        "Then the women began to hurl reproaches at her; first one cried\nout, “How could you do such a thing!” then another, “To think of\nleaving a helpless little thing up there,\"–while again and\nagain came the words, “The poor mite! the poor mite!” pursuing\nher as she went along. Unable at last to bear it any longer Dete\nran forward as fast as she could until she was beyond reach of\ntheir voices. She was far from happy at the thought of what she\nhad done, for the child had been left in her care by her dying\nmother. She quieted herself, however, with the idea that she\nwould be better able to do something for the child if she was\nearning plenty of money, and it was a relief to her to think\nthat she would soon be far away from all these people who were\nmaking such a fuss about the matter, and she rejoiced further\nstill that she was at liberty now to take such a good place.",
        "As soon as Dete had disappeared the old man went back to his\nbench, and there he remained seated, staring on the ground\nwithout uttering a sound, while thick curls of smoke floated\nupward from his pipe. Heidi, meanwhile, was enjoying herself in\nher new surroundings; she looked about till she found a shed,\nbuilt against the hut, where the goats were kept; she peeped in,\nand saw it was empty. She continued her search and presently\ncame to the fir trees behind the hut. A strong breeze was blowing\nthrough them, and there was a rushing and roaring in their\ntopmost branches, Heidi stood still and listened. The sound\ngrowing fainter, she went on again, to the farther corner of the\nhut, and so round to where her grandfather was sitting. Seeing\nthat he was in exactly the same position as when she left him,\nshe went and placed herself in front of the old man, and putting\nher hands behind her back, stood and gazed at him. Her\ngrandfather looked up, and as she continued standing there\nwithout moving, “What is it you want?” he asked.",
        "“I want to see what you have inside the house,” said Heidi.",
        "“Come then!” and the grandfather rose and went before her\ntowards the hut.",
        "“Bring your bundle of clothes in with you,” he bid her as she\nwas following.",
        "“I shan’t want them any more,” was her prompt answer.",
        "The old man turned and looked searchingly at the child, whose\ndark eyes were sparkling in delighted anticipation of what she\nwas going to see inside. “She is certainly not wanting in\nintelligence,” he murmured to himself. “And why shall you not\nwant them any more?” he asked aloud.",
        "“Because I want to go about like the goats with their thin light\nlegs.”",
        "“Well, you can do so if you like,” said her grandfather, “but\nbring the things in, we must put them in the cupboard.”",
        "Heidi did as she was told. The old man now opened the door and\nHeidi stepped inside after him; she found herself in a good-\nsized room, which covered the whole ground floor of the hut. A\ntable and a chair were the only furniture; in one corner stood\nthe grandfather’s bed, in another was the hearth with a large\nkettle hanging above it; and on the further side was a large door\nin the wall–this was the cupboard. The grandfather opened it;\ninside were his clothes, some hanging up, others, a couple of\nshirts, and some socks and handkerchiefs, lying on a shelf; on a\nsecond shelf were some plates and cups and glasses, and on a\nhigher one still, a round loaf, smoked meat, and cheese, for\neverything that Alm-Uncle needed for his food and clothing was\nkept in this cupboard. Heidi, as soon as it was opened, ran\nquickly forward and thrust in her bundle of clothes, as far back\nbehind her grandfather’s things as possible, so that they might\nnot easily be found again. She then looked carefully round the\nroom, and asked, “Where am I to sleep, grandfather?”",
        "“Wherever you like,” he answered.",
        "Heidi was delighted, and began at once to examine all the nooks\nand corners to find out where it would be pleasantest to sleep.\nIn the corner near her grandfather’s bed she saw a short ladder\nagainst the wall; up she climbed and found herself in the\nhayloft. There lay a large heap of fresh sweet-smelling hay,\nwhile through a round window in the wall she could see right\ndown the valley.",
        "“I shall sleep up here, grandfather,” she called down to him,\n\"It’s lovely, up here. Come up and see how lovely it is!”",
        "“Oh, I know all about it,” he called up in answer.",
        "“I am getting the bed ready now,” she called down again, as she\nwent busily to and fro at her work, “but I shall want you to\nbring me up a sheet; you can’t have a bed without a sheet, you\nwant it to lie upon.”",
        "“All right,” said the grandfather, and presently he went to the\ncupboard, and after rummaging about inside for a few minutes he\ndrew out a long, coarse piece of stuff, which was all he had to\ndo duty for a sheet. He carried it up to the loft, where he\nfound Heidi had already made quite a nice bed. She had put an\nextra heap of hay at one end for a pillow, and had so arranged it\nthat, when in bed, she would be able to see comfortably out\nthrough the round window.",
        "“That is capital,” said her grandfather; “now we must put on the\nsheet, but wait a moment first,” and he went and fetched another\nlarge bundle of hay to make the bed thicker, so that the child\nshould not feel the hard floor under her–\"there, now bring it\nhere.” Heidi had got hold of the sheet, but it was almost too\nheavy for her to carry; this was a good thing, however, as the\nclose thick stuff would prevent the sharp stalks of the hay\nrunning through and pricking her. The two together now spread\nthe sheet over the bed, and where it was too long or too broad,\nHeidi quickly tucked it in under the hay. It looked now as tidy\nand comfortable a bed as you could wish for, and Heidi stood\ngazing thoughtfully at her handiwork.",
        "“We have forgotten something now, grandfather,” she said after a\nshort silence.",
        "“What’s that?” he asked.",
        "“A coverlid; when you get into bed, you have to creep in between\nthe sheets and the coverlid.”",
        "“Oh, that’s the way, is it? But suppose I have not got a\ncoverlid?” said the old man.",
        "“Well, never mind, grandfather,” said Heidi in a consoling tone\nof voice, “I can take some more hay to put over me,” and she was\nturning quickly to fetch another armful from the heap, when her\ngrandfather stopped her. “Wait a moment,” he said, and he\nclimbed down the ladder again and went towards his bed. He\nreturned to the loft with a large, thick sack, made of flax,\nwhich he threw down, exclaiming, “There, that is better than hay,\nis it not?”",
        "Heidi began tugging away at the sack with all her little might,\nin her efforts to get it smooth and straight, but her small\nhands were not fitted for so heavy a job. Her grandfather came to\nher assistance, and when they had got it tidily spread over the\nbed, it all looked so nice and warm and comfortable that Heidi\nstood gazing at it in delight. “That is a splendid coverlid,” she\nsaid, “and the bed looks lovely altogether! I wish it was night,\nso that I might get inside it at once.”",
        "“I think we might have something to eat first,” said the\ngrandfather, “what do you think?”",
        "Heidi in the excitement of bed-making had forgotten everything\nelse; but now when she began to think about food she felt\nterribly hungry, for she had had nothing to eat since the piece\nof bread and little cup of thin coffee that had been her\nbreakfast early that morning before starting on her long, hot\njourney. So she answered without hesitation, “Yes, I think so\ntoo.”",
        "“Let us go down then, as we both think alike,” said the old man,\nand he followed the child down the ladder. Then he went up to\nthe hearth, pushed the big kettle aside, and drew forward the\nlittle one that was hanging on the chain, and seating himself on\nthe round-topped, three-legged stool before the fire, blew it up\ninto a clear bright flame. The kettle soon began to boil, and\nmeanwhile the old man held a large piece of cheese on a long\niron fork over the fire, turning it round and round till it was\ntoasted a nice golden yellow color on each side. Heidi watched\nall that was going on with eager curiosity. Suddenly some new\nidea seemed to come into her head, for she turned and ran to the\ncupboard, and then began going busily backwards and forwards.\nPresently the grandfather got up and came to the table with a\njug and the cheese, and there he saw it already tidily laid with\nthe round loaf and two plates and two knives each in its right\nplace; for Heidi had taken exact note that morning of all that\nthere was in the cupboard, and she knew which things would be\nwanted for their meal.",
        "“Ah, that’s right,” said the grandfather, “I am glad to see that\nyou have some ideas of your own,” and as he spoke he laid the\ntoasted cheese on a layer of bread, “but there is still\nsomething missing.”",
        "Heidi looked at the jug that was steaming away invitingly, and\nran quickly back to the cupboard. At first she could only see a\nsmall bowl left on the shelf, but she was not long in\nperplexity, for a moment later she caught sight of two glasses\nfurther back, and without an instant’s loss of time she returned\nwith these and the bowl and put them down on the table.",
        "“Good, I see you know how to set about things; but what will you\ndo for a seat?” The grandfather himself was sitting on the only\nchair in the room. Heidi flew to the hearth, and dragging the\nthree-legged stool up to the table, sat herself down upon it.",
        "“Well, you have managed to find a seat for yourself, I see, only\nrather a low one I am afraid,” said the grandfather, “but you\nwould not be tall enough to reach the table even if you sat in\nmy chair; the first thing now, however, is to have something to\neat, so come along.”",
        "With that he stood up, filled the bowl with milk, and placing it\non the chair, pushed it in front of Heidi on her little three-\nlegged stool, so that she now had a table to herself. Then he\nbrought her a large slice of bread and a piece of the golden\ncheese, and told her to eat. After which he went and sat down on\nthe corner of the table and began his own meal. Heidi lifted the\nbowl with both hands and drank without pause till it was empty,\nfor the thirst of all her long hot journey had returned upon\nher. Then she drew a deep breath–in the eagerness of her thirst\nshe had not stopped to breathe–and put down the bowl.",
        "“Was the milk nice?” asked her grandfather.",
        "“I never drank any so good before,” answered Heidi.",
        "“Then you must have some more,” and the old man filled her bowl\nagain to the brim and set it before the child, who was now\nhungrily beginning her bread having first spread it with the\ncheese, which after being toasted was soft as butter; the two\ntogether tasted deliciously, and the child looked the picture of\ncontent as she sat eating, and at intervals taking further\ndraughts of milk. The meal being over, the grandfather went\noutside to put the goat-shed in order, and Heidi watched with\ninterest while he first swept it out, and then put fresh straw\nfor the goats to sleep upon. Then he went to the little well-\nshed, and there he cut some long round sticks, and a small round\nboard; in this he bored some holes and stuck the sticks into\nthem, and there, as if made by magic, was a three-legged stool\njust like her grandfather’s, only higher. Heidi stood and looked\nat it, speechless with astonishment.",
        "“What do you think that is?” asked her grandfather.",
        "“It’s my stool, I know, because it is such a high one; and it\nwas made all of a minute,” said the child, still lost in wonder\nand admiration.",
        "“She understands what she sees, her eyes are in the right\nplace,” remarked the grandfather to himself, as he continued his\nway round the hut, knocking in a nail here and there, or making\nfast some part of the door, and so with hammer and nails and\npieces of wood going from spot to spot, mending or clearing away\nwherever work of the kind was needed. Heidi followed him step by\nstep, her eyes attentively taking in all that he did, and\neverything that she saw was a fresh source of pleasure to her.",
        "And so the time passed happily on till evening. Then the wind\nbegan to roar louder than ever through the old fir trees; Heidi\nlistened with delight to the sound, and it filled her heart so\nfull of gladness that she skipped and danced round the old\ntrees, as if some unheard of joy had come to her. The grandfather\nstood and watched her from the shed.",
        "Suddenly a shrill whistle was heard. Heidi paused in her\ndancing, and the grandfather came out. Down from the heights\nabove the goats came springing one after another, with Peter in\ntheir midst. Heidi sprang forward with a cry of joy and rushed\namong the flock, greeting first one and then another of her old\nfriends of the morning. As they neared the hut the goats stood\nstill, and then two of their number, two beautiful slender\nanimals, one white and one brown, ran forward to where the\ngrandfather was standing and began licking his hands, for he was\nholding a little salt which he always had ready for his goats on\ntheir return home. Peter disappeared with the remainder of his\nflock. Heidi tenderly stroked the two goats in turn, running\nfirst to one side of them and then the other, and jumping about\nin her glee at the pretty little animals. “Are they ours,\ngrandfather? Are they both ours? Are you going to put them in the\nshed? Will they always stay with us?”",
        "Heidi’s questions came tumbling out one after the other, so that\nher grandfather had only time to answer each of them with “Yes,\nyes.” When the goats had finished licking up the salt her\ngrandfather told her to go and fetch her bowl and the bread.",
        "Heidi obeyed and was soon back again. The grandfather milked the\nwhite goat and filled her basin, and then breaking off a piece\nof bread, “Now eat your supper,” he said, “and then go up to bed.\nCousin Dete left another little bundle for you with a nightgown\nand other small things in it, which you will find at the bottom\nof the cupboard if you want them. I must go and shut up the\ngoats, so be off and sleep well.”",
        "“Good-night, grandfather! good-night. What are their names,\ngrandfather, what are their names?” she called out as she ran\nafter his retreating figure and the goats.",
        "“The white one is named Little Swan, and the brown one Little\nBear,” he answered.",
        "“Good-night, Little Swan, good-night, Little Bear!” she called\nagain at the top of her voice, for they were already inside the\nshed. Then she sat down on the seat and began to eat and drink,\nbut the wind was so strong that it almost blew her away; so she\nmade haste and finished her supper and then went indoors and\nclimbed up to her bed, where she was soon lying as sweetly and\nsoundly asleep as any young princess on her couch of silk.",
        "Not long after, and while it was still twilight, the grandfather\nalso went to bed, for he was up every morning at sunrise, and\nthe sun came climbing up over the mountains at a very early hour\nduring these summer months. The wind grew so tempestuous during\nthe night, and blew in such gusts against the walls, that the\nhut trembled and the old beams groaned and creaked. It came\nhowling and wailing down the chimney like voices of those in\npain, and it raged with such fury among the old fir trees that\nhere and there a branch was snapped and fell. In the middle of\nthe night the old man got up. “The child will be frightened,” he\nmurmured half aloud. He mounted the ladder and went and stood by\nthe child’s bed.",
        "Outside the moon was struggling with the dark, fast-driving\nclouds, which at one moment left it clear and shining, and the\nnext swept over it, and all again was dark. Just now the\nmoonlight was falling through the round window straight on to\nHeidi’s bed. She lay under the heavy coverlid, her cheeks rosy\nwith sleep, her head peacefully resting on her little round arm,\nand with a happy expression on her baby face as if dreaming of\nsomething pleasant. The old man stood looking down on the\nsleeping child until the moon again disappeared behind the\nclouds and he could see no more, then he went back to bed.",
        "Heidi was awakened early the next morning by a loud whistle; the\nsun was shining through the round window and falling in golden\nrays on her bed and on the large heap of hay, and as she opened\nher eyes everything in the loft seemed gleaming with gold. She\nlooked around her in astonishment and could not imagine for a\nwhile where she was. But her grandfather’s deep voice was now\nheard outside, and then Heidi began to recall all that had\nhappened: how she had come away from her former home and was now\non the mountain with her grandfather instead of with old Ursula.\nThe latter was nearly stone deaf and always felt cold, so that\nshe sat all day either by the hearth in the kitchen or by the\nsitting-room stove, and Heidi had been obliged to stay close to\nher, for the old woman was so deaf that she could not tell where\nthe child was if out of her sight. And Heidi, shut up within the\nfour walls, had often longed to be out of doors. So she felt\nvery happy this morning as she woke up in her new home and\nremembered all the many new things that she had seen the day\nbefore and which she would see again that day, and above all she\nthought with delight of the two dear goats. Heidi jumped quickly\nout of bed and a very few minutes sufficed her to put on the\nclothes which she had taken off the night before, for there were\nnot many of them. Then she climbed down the ladder and ran\noutside the hut. There stood Peter already with his flock of\ngoats, and the grandfather was just bringing his two out of the\nshed to join the others. Heidi ran forward to wish good-morning\nto him and the goats.",
        "“Do you want to go with them on to the mountain?” asked her\ngrandfather. Nothing could have pleased Heidi better, and she\njumped for joy in answer.",
        "“But you must first wash and make yourself tidy. The sun that\nshines so brightly overhead will else laugh at you for being\ndirty; see, I have put everything ready for you,” and her\ngrandfather pointed as he spoke to a large tub full of water,\nwhich stood in the sun before the door. Heidi ran to it and\nbegan splashing and rubbing, till she quite glistened with\ncleanliness. The grandfather meanwhile went inside the hut,\ncalling to Peter to follow him and bring in his wallet. Peter\nobeyed with astonishment, and laid down the little bag which held\nhis meagre dinner.",
        "“Open it,” said the old man, and inside it he put a large piece\nof bread and an equally large piece of cheese, which made Peter\nopen his eyes, for each was twice the size of the two portions\nwhich he had for his own dinner.",
        "“There, now there is only the little bowl to add,” continued the\ngrandfather, “for the child cannot drink her milk as you do from\nthe goat; she is not accustomed to that. You must milk two\nbowlfuls for her when she has her dinner, for she is going with\nyou and will remain with you till you return this evening; but\ntake care she does not fall over any of the rocks, do you hear?”",
        "Heidi now came running in. “Will the sun laugh at me now,\ngrandfather?” she asked anxiously. Her grandfather had left a\ncoarse towel hanging up for her near the tub, and with this she\nhad so thoroughly scrubbed her face, arms, and neck, for fear of\nthe sun, that as she stood there she was as red all over as a\nlobster. He gave a little laugh.",
        "“No, there is nothing for him to laugh at now,” he assured her.\n\"But I tell you what–when you come home this evening, you will\nhave to get right into the tub, like a fish, for if you run\nabout like the goats you will get your feet dirty. Now you can be\noff.”",
        "She started joyfully for the mountain. During the night the wind\nhad blown away all the clouds; the dark blue sky was spreading\noverhead, and in its midst was the bright sun shining down on\nthe green slopes of the mountain, where the flowers opened their\nlittle blue and yellow cups, and looked up to him smiling. Heidi\nwent running hither and thither and shouting with delight, for\nhere were whole patches of delicate red primroses, and there the\nblue gleam of the lovely gentian, while above them all laughed\nand nodded the tender-leaved golden cistus. Enchanted with all\nthis waving field of brightly-colored flowers, Heidi forgot even\nPeter and the goats. She ran on in front and then off to the\nside, tempted first one way and then the other, as she caught\nsight of some bright spot of glowing red or yellow. And all the\nwhile she was plucking whole handfuls of the flowers which she\nput into her little apron, for she wanted to take them all home\nand stick them in the hay, so that she might make her bedroom\nlook just like the meadows outside. Peter had therefore to be on\nthe alert, and his round eyes, which did not move very quickly,\nhad more work than they could well manage, for the goats were as\nlively as Heidi; they ran in all directions, and Peter had to\nfollow whistling and calling and swinging his stick to get all\nthe runaways together again.",
        "“Where have you got to now, Heidi?” he called out somewhat\ncrossly.",
        "“Here,” called back a voice from somewhere. Peter could see no\none, for Heidi was seated on the ground at the foot of a small\nhill thickly overgrown with sweet smelling prunella; the whole\nair seemed filled with its fragrance, and Heidi thought she had\nnever smelt anything so delicious. She sat surrounded by the\nflowers, drawing in deep breaths of the scented air.",
        "“Come along here!” called Peter again. “You are not to fall over\nthe rocks, your grandfather gave orders that you were not to do\nso.”",
        "“Where are the rocks?” asked Heidi, answering him back. But she\ndid not move from her seat, for the scent of the flowers seemed\nsweeter to her with every breath of wind that wafted it towards\nher.",
        "“Up above, right up above. We have a long way to go yet, so come\nalong! And on the topmost peak of all the old bird of prey sits\nand croaks.”",
        "That did it. Heidi immediately sprang to her feet and ran up to\nPeter with her apron full of flowers.",
        "“You have got enough now,” said the boy as they began climbing\nup again together. “You will stay here forever if you go on\npicking, and if you gather all the flowers now there will be none\nfor to-morrow.”",
        "This last argument seemed a convincing one to Heidi, and\nmoreover her apron was already so full that there was hardly room\nfor another flower, and it would never do to leave nothing to\npick for another day. So she now kept with Peter, and the goats\nalso became more orderly in their behavior, for they were\nbeginning to smell the plants they loved that grew on the higher\nslopes and clambered up now without pause in their anxiety to\nreach them. The spot where Peter generally halted for his goats\nto pasture and where he took up his quarters for the day lay at\nthe foot of the high rocks, which were covered for some distance\nup by bushes and fir trees, beyond which rose their bare and\nrugged summits. On one side of the mountain the rock was split\ninto deep clefts, and the grandfather had reason to warn Peter of\ndanger. Having climbed as far as the halting-place, Peter unslung\nhis wallet and put it carefully in a little hollow of the ground,\nfor he knew what the wind was like up there and did not want to\nsee his precious belongings sent rolling down the mountain by a\nsudden gust. Then be threw himself at full length on the warm\nground, for he was tired after all his exertions.",
        "Heidi meanwhile had unfastened her apron and rolling it\ncarefully round the flowers laid it beside Peter’s wallet inside\nthe hollow; she then sat down beside his outstretched figure and\nlooked about her. The valley lay far below bathed in the morning\nsun. In front of her rose a broad snow-field, high against the\ndark-blue sky, while to the left was a huge pile of rocks on\neither side of which a bare lofty peak, that seemed to pierce\nthe blue, looked frowningly down upon, her. The child sat without\nmoving, her eyes taking in the whole scene, and all around was a\ngreat stillness, only broken by soft, light puffs of wind that\nswayed the light bells of the blue flowers, and the shining gold\nheads of the cistus, and set them nodding merrily on their\nslender stems. Peter had fallen asleep after his fatigue and the\ngoats were climbing about among the bushes overhead. Heidi had\nnever felt so happy in her life before. She drank in the golden\nsunlight, the fresh air, the sweet smell of the flowers, and\nwished for nothing better than to remain there forever. So the\ntime went on, while to Heidi, who had so often looked up from\nthe valley at the mountains above, these seemed now to have\nfaces, and to be looking down at her like old friends. Suddenly\nshe heard a loud harsh cry overhead and lifting her eyes she saw\na bird, larger than any she had ever seen before, with great,\nspreading wings, wheeling round and round in wide circles, and\nuttering a piercing, croaking kind of sound above her.",
        "“Peter, Peter, wake up!” called out Heidi. “See, the great bird\nis there–look, look!”",
        "Peter got up on hearing her call, and together they sat and\nwatched the bird, which rose higher and higher in the blue air\ntill it disappeared behind the grey mountain-tops.",
        "“Where has it gone to?” asked Heidi, who had followed the bird’s\nmovements with intense interest.",
        "“Home to its nest,” said Peter.",
        "“Is his home right up there? Oh, how nice to be up so high! why\ndoes he make that noise?”",
        "“Because he can’t help it,” explained Peter.",
        "“Let us climb up there and see where his nest is,” proposed\nHeidi.",
        "“Oh! oh! oh!” exclaimed Peter, his disapproval of Heidi’s\nsuggestion becoming more marked with each ejaculation, “why even\nthe goats cannot climb as high as that, besides didn’t Uncle say\nthat you were not to fall over the rocks?”",
        "Peter now began suddenly whistling and calling in such a loud\nmanner that Heidi could not think what was happening; but the\ngoats evidently understood his voice, for one after the other\nthey came springing down the rocks until they were all assembled\non the green plateau, some continuing to nibble at the juicy\nstems, others skipping about here and there or pushing at each\nother with their horns for pastime.",
        "Heidi jumped up and ran in and out among them, for it was new to\nher to see the goats playing together like this and her delight\nwas beyond words as she joined in their frolics; she made\npersonal acquaintance with them all in turn, for they were like\nseparate individuals to her, each single goat having a\nparticular way of behavior of its own. Meanwhile Peter had taken\nthe wallet out of the hollow and placed the pieces of bread and\ncheese on the ground in the shape of a square, the larger two on\nHeidi’s side and the smaller on his own, for he knew exactly\nwhich were hers and which his. Then he took the little bowl and\nmilked some delicious fresh milk into it from the white goat, and\nafterwards set the bowl in the middle of the square. Now he\ncalled Heidi to come, but she wanted more calling than the goats,\nfor the child was so excited and amused at the capers and lively\ngames of her new playfellows that she saw and heard nothing else.\nBut Peter knew how to make himself heard, for he shouted till the\nvery rocks above echoed his voice, and at last Heidi appeared,\nand when she saw the inviting repast spread out upon the ground\nshe went skipping round it for joy.",
        "“Leave off jumping about, it is time for dinner,” said Peter;\n\"sit down now and begin.”",
        "Heidi sat down. “Is the milk for me?” she asked, giving another\nlook of delight at the beautifully arranged square with the bowl\nas a chief ornament in the centre.",
        "“Yes,” replied Peter, “and the two large pieces of bread and\ncheese are yours also, and when you have drunk up that milk, you\nare to have another bowlful from the white goat, and then it\nwill be my turn.”",
        "“And which do you get your milk from?” inquired Heidi.",
        "“From my own goat, the piebald one. But go on now with your\ndinner,” said Peter, again reminding her it was time to eat.\nHeidi now took up the bowl and drank her milk, and as soon as\nshe had put it down empty Peter rose and filled it again for her.\nThen she broke off a piece of her bread and held out the\nremainder, which was still larger than Peter’s own piece,\ntogether with the whole big slice of cheese to her companion,\nsaying, “You can have that, I have plenty.”",
        "Peter looked at Heidi, unable to speak for astonishment, for\nnever in all his life could he have said and done like that with\nanything he had. He hesitated a moment, for he could not believe\nthat Heidi was in earnest; but the latter kept on holding out\nthe bread and cheese, and as Peter still did not take it, she\nlaid it down on his knees. He saw then that she really meant it;\nhe seized the food, nodded his thanks and acceptance of her\npresent, and then made a more splendid meal than he had known\never since he was a goat-herd. Heidi the while still continued to\nwatch the goats. “Tell me all their names,” she said.",
        "Peter knew these by heart, for having very little else to carry\nin his head he had no difficulty in remembering them. So he\nbegan, telling Heidi the name of each goat in turn as he pointed\nit out to her. Heidi listened with great attention, and it was\nnot long before she could herself distinguish the goats from one\nanother and could call each by name, for every goat had its own\npeculiarities which could not easily be mistaken; only one had\nto watch them closely, and this Heidi did. There was the great\nTurk with his big horns, who was always wanting to butt the\nothers, so that most of them ran away when they saw him coming\nand would have nothing to do with their rough companion. Only\nGreenfinch, the slender nimble little goat, was brave enough to\nface him, and would make a rush at him, three or four times in\nsuccession, with such agility and dexterity, that the great Turk\noften stood still quite astounded not venturing to attack her\nagain, for Greenfinch was fronting him, prepared for more warlike\naction, and her horns were sharp. Then there was little White\nSnowflake, who bleated in such a plaintive and beseeching manner\nthat Heidi already had several times run to it and taken its head\nin her hands to comfort it. Just at this moment the pleading\nyoung cry was heard again, and Heidi jumped up running and,\nputting her arms round the little creature’s neck, asked in a\nsympathetic voice, “What is it, little Snowflake? Why do you call\nlike that as if in trouble?” The goat pressed closer to Heidi in\na confiding way and left off bleating. Peter called out from\nwhere he was sitting–for he had not yet got to the end of his\nbread and cheese, “She cries like that because the old goat is\nnot with her; she was sold at Mayenfeld the day before yesterday,\nand so will not come up the mountain any more.”",
        "“Who is the old goat?” called Heidi back.",
        "“Why, her mother, of course,” was the answer.",
        "“Where is the grandmother?” called Heidi again.",
        "“She has none.”",
        "“And the grandfather?”",
        "“She has none.”",
        "“Oh, you poor little Snowflake!” exclaimed Heidi, clasping the\nanimal gently to her, “but do not cry like that any more; see\nnow, I shall come up here with you every day, so that you will\nnot be alone any more, and if you want anything you have only to\ncome to me.”",
        "The young animal rubbed its head contentedly against Heidi’s\nshoulder, and no longer gave such plaintive bleats. Peter now\nhaving finished his meal joined Heidi and the goats, Heidi\nhaving by this time found out a great many things about these.\nShe had decided that by far the handsomest and best-behaved of\nthe goats were undoubtedly the two belonging to her grandfather;\nthey carried themselves with a certain air of distinction and\ngenerally went their own way, and as to the great Turk they\ntreated him with indifference and contempt.",
        "The goats were now beginning to climb the rocks again, each\nseeking for the plants it liked in its own fashion, some jumping\nover everything they met till they found what they wanted,\nothers going more carefully and cropping all the nice leaves by\nthe way, the Turk still now and then giving the others a poke\nwith his horns. Little Swan and Little Bear clambered lightly up\nand never failed to find the best bushes, and then they would\nstand gracefully poised on their pretty legs, delicately nibbling\nat the leaves. Heidi stood with her hands behind her back,\ncarefully noting all they did.",
        "“Peter,” she said to the boy who had again thrown himself down\non the ground, “the prettiest of all the goats are Little Swan\nand Little Bear.”",
        "“Yes, I know they are,” was the answer. “Alm-Uncle brushes them\ndown and washes them and gives them salt, and he has the nicest\nshed for them.”",
        "All of a sudden Peter leaped to his feet and ran hastily after\nthe goats. Heidi followed him as fast as she could, for she was\ntoo eager to know what had happened to stay behind. Peter dashed\nthrough the middle of the flock towards that side of the\nmountain where the rocks fell perpendicularly to a great depth\nbelow, and where any thoughtless goat, if it went too near, might\nfall over and break all its legs. He had caught sight of the\ninquisitive Greenfinch taking leaps in that direction, and he was\nonly just in time, for the animal had already sprung to the edge\nof the abyss. All Peter could do was to throw himself down and\nseize one of her hind legs. Greenfinch, thus taken by surprise,\nbegan bleating furiously, angry at being held so fast and\nprevented from continuing her voyage of discovery. She struggled\nto get loose, and endeavored so obstinately to leap forward that\nPeter shouted to Heidi to come and help him, for he could not get\nup and was afraid of pulling out the goat’s leg altogether.",
        "Heidi had already run up and she saw at once the danger both\nPeter and the animal were in. She quickly gathered a bunch of\nsweet-smelling leaves, and then, holding them under Greenfinch’s\nnose, said coaxingly, “Come, come, Greenfinch, you must not be\nnaughty! Look, you might fall down there and break your leg, and\nthat would give you dreadful pain!”",
        "The young animal turned quickly, and began contentedly eating\nthe leaves out of Heidi’s hand. Meanwhile Peter got on to his\nfeet again and took hold of Greenfinch by the band round her neck\nfrom which her bell was hung, and Heidi taking hold of her in the\nsame way on the other side, they led the wanderer back to the\nrest of the flock that had remained peacefully feeding. Peter,\nnow he had his goat in safety, lifted his stick in order to give\nher a good beating as punishment, and Greenfinch seeing what was\ncoming shrank back in fear. But Heidi cried out, “No, no, Peter,\nyou must not strike her; see how frightened she is!”",
        "“She deserves it,” growled Peter, and again lifted his stick.\nThen Heidi flung herself against him and cried indignantly, “You\nhave no right to touch her, it will hurt her, let her alone!”",
        "Peter looked with surprise at the commanding little figure,\nwhose dark eyes were flashing, and reluctantly he let his stick\ndrop. “Well I will let her off if you will give me some more of\nyour cheese to-morrow,” he said, for he was determined to have\nsomething to make up to him for his fright.",
        "“You shall have it all, to-morrow and every day, I do not want\nit,” replied Heidi, giving ready consent to his demand. “And I\nwill give you bread as well, a large piece like you had to-day;\nbut then you must promise never to beat Greenfinch, or\nSnowflake, or any of the goats.”",
        "“All right,” said Peter, “I don’t care,” which meant that he\nwould agree to the bargain. He now let go of Greenfinch, who\njoyfully sprang to join her companions.",
        "And thus imperceptibly the day had crept on to its close, and\nnow the sun was on the point of sinking out of sight behind the\nhigh mountains. Heidi was again sitting on the ground, silently\ngazing at the blue bell-shaped flowers, as they glistened in the\nevening sun, for a golden light lay on the grass and flowers, and\nthe rocks above were beginning to shine and glow. All at once she\nsprang to her feet, “Peter! Peter! everything is on fire! All\nthe rocks are burning, and the great snow mountain and the sky! O\nlook, look! the high rock up there is red with flame! O the\nbeautiful, fiery snow! Stand up, Peter! See, the fire has\nreached the great bird’s nest! look at the rocks! look at the fir\ntrees! Everything, everything is on fire!”",
        "“It is always like that,” said Peter composedly, continuing to\npeel his stick; “but it is not really fire.”",
        "“What is it then?” cried Heidi, as she ran backwards and\nforwards to look first one side and then the other, for she felt\nshe could not have enough of such a beautiful sight. “What is it,\nPeter, what is it?” she repeated.",
        "“It gets like that of itself,” explained Peter.",
        "“Look, look!” cried Heidi in fresh excitement, “now they have\nturned all rose color! Look at that one covered with snow, and\nthat with the high, pointed rocks! What do you call them?”",
        "“Mountains have not any names,” he answered.",
        "“O how beautiful, look at the crimson snow! And up there on the\nrocks there are ever so many roses! Oh! now they are turning\ngrey! Oh! oh! now all the color has died away! it’s all gone,\nPeter.” And Heidi sat down on the ground looking as full of\ndistress as if everything had really come to an end.",
        "“It will come again to-morrow,” said Peter. “Get up, we must go\nhome now.” He whistled to his goats and together they all\nstarted on their homeward way.",
        "“Is it like that every day, shall we see it every day when we\nbring the goats up here?” asked Heidi, as she clambered down the\nmountain at Peter’s side; she waited eagerly for his answer,\nhoping that he would tell her it was so.",
        "“It is like that most days,” he replied.",
        "“But will it be like that to-morrow for certain?” Heidi\npersisted.",
        "“Yes, yes, to-morrow for certain,” Peter assured her in answer.",
        "Heidi now felt quite happy again, and her little brain was so\nfull of new impressions and new thoughts that she did not speak\nany more until they had reached the hut. The grandfather was\nsitting under the fir trees, where he had also put up a seat,\nwaiting as usual for his goats which returned down the mountain\non this side.",
        "Heidi ran up to him followed by the white and brown goats, for\nthey knew their own master and stall. Peter called out after\nher, “Come with me again to-morrow! Good-night!” For he was\nanxious for more than one reason that Heidi should go with him\nthe next day.",
        "Heidi ran back quickly and gave Peter her hand, promising to go\nwith him, and then making her way through the goats she once\nmore clasped Snowflake round the neck, saying in a gentle\nsoothing voice, “Sleep well, Snowflake, and remember that I shall\nbe with you again to-morrow, so you must not bleat so sadly any\nmore.” Snowflake gave her a friendly and grateful look, and then\nwent leaping joyfully after the other goats.",
        "Heidi returned to the fir-trees. “O grandfather,” she cried,\neven before she had come up to him, “it was so beautiful. The\nfire, and the roses on the rocks, and the blue and yellow\nflowers, and look what I have brought you!” And opening the apron\nthat held her flowers she shook them all out at her grandfather’s\nfeet. But the poor flowers, how changed they were! Heidi hardly\nknew them again. They looked like dry bits of hay, not a single\nlittle flower cup stood open. “O grandfather, what is the matter\nwith them?” exclaimed Heidi in shocked surprise, “they were not\nlike that this morning, why do they look so now?”",
        "“They like to stand out there in the sun and not to be shut up\nin an apron,” said her grandfather.",
        "“Then I will never gather any more. But, grandfather, why did\nthe great bird go on croaking so?” she continued in an eager tone\nof inquiry.",
        "“Go along now and get into your bath while I go and get some\nmilk; when we are together at supper I will tell you all about\nit.”",
        "Heidi obeyed, and when later she was sitting on her high stool\nbefore her milk bowl with her grandfather beside her, she\nrepeated her question, “Why does the great bird go on croaking\nand screaming down at us, grandfather?”",
        "“He is mocking at the people who live down below in the\nvillages, because they all go huddling and gossiping together,\nand encourage one another in evil talking and deeds. He calls\nout, ’If you would separate and each go your own way and come up\nhere and live on a height as I do, it would be better for you!’\"\nThere was almost a wildness in the old man’s voice as he spoke,\nso that Heidi seemed to hear the croaking of the bird again even\nmore distinctly.",
        "“Why haven’t the mountains any names?” Heidi went on.",
        "“They have names,” answered her grandfather, “and if you can\ndescribe one of them to me that I know I will tell you what it\nis called.”",
        "Heidi then described to him the rocky mountain with the two high\npeaks so exactly that the grandfather was delighted. “Just so, I\nknow it,” and he told her its name. “Did you see any other?”",
        "Then Heidi told him of the mountain with the great snow-field,\nand how it had been on fire, and had turned rosy-red and then all\nof a sudden had grown quite pale again and all the color had\ndisappeared.",
        "“I know that one too,” he said, giving her its name. “So you\nenjoyed being out with the goats?”",
        "Then Heidi went on to give him an account of the whole day, and\nof how delightful it had all been, and particularly described\nthe fire that had burst out everywhere in the evening. And then\nnothing would do but her grandfather must tell how it came, for\nPeter knew nothing about it.",
        "The grandfather explained to her that it was the sun that did\nit. “When he says good-night to the mountains he throws his most\nbeautiful colors over them, so that they may not forget him\nbefore he comes again the next day.”",
        "Heidi was delighted with this explanation, and could hardly bear\nto wait for another day to come that she might once more climb\nup with the goats and see how the sun bid good-night to the\nmountains. But she had to go to bed first, and all night she\nslept soundly on her bed of hay, dreaming of nothing but of\nshining mountains with red roses all over them, among which\nhappy little Snowflake went leaping in and out.",
        "The next morning the sun came out early as bright as ever, and\nthen Peter appeared with the goats, and again the two children\nclimbed up together to the high meadows, and so it went on day\nafter day till Heidi, passing her life thus among the grass and\nflowers, was burnt brown with the sun, and grew so strong and\nhealthy that nothing ever ailed her. She was happy too, and\nlived from day to day as free and lighthearted as the little\nbirds that make their home among the green forest trees. Then the\nautumn came, and the wind blew louder and stronger, and the\ngrandfather would say sometimes, “To-day you must stay at home,\nHeidi; a sudden gust of the wind would blow a little thing like\nyou over the rocks into the valley below in a moment.”",
        "Whenever Peter heard that he must go alone he looked very\nunhappy, for he saw nothing but mishaps of all kinds ahead, and\ndid not know how he should bear the long dull day without Heidi.\nThen, too, there was the good meal he would miss, and besides\nthat the goats on these days were so naughty and obstinate that\nhe had twice the usual trouble with them, for they had grown so\naccustomed to Heidi’s presence that they would run in every\ndirection and refuse to go on unless she was with them. Heidi\nwas never unhappy, for wherever she was she found something to\ninterest or amuse her. She liked best, it is true, to go out\nwith Peter up to the flowers and the great bird, where there was\nso much to be seen, and so many experiences to go through among\nthe goats with their different characters; but she also found her\ngrandfather’s hammering and sawing and carpentering very\nentertaining, and if it should chance to be the day when the\nlarge round goat’s-milk cheese was made she enjoyed beyond\nmeasure looking on at this wonderful performance, and watching\nher grandfather, as with sleeves rolled back, he stirred the\ngreat cauldron with his bare arms. The thing which attracted her\nmost, however, was the waving and roaring of the three old fir\ntrees on these windy days. She would run away repeatedly from\nwhatever she might be doing, to listen to them, for nothing\nseemed so strange and wonderful to her as the deep mysterious\nsound in the tops of the trees. She would stand underneath them\nand look up, unable to tear herself away, looking and listening\nwhile they bowed and swayed and roared as the mighty wind rushed\nthrough them. There was no longer now the warm bright sun that\nhad shone all through the summer, so Heidi went to the cupboard\nand got out her shoes and stockings and dress, for it was\ngrowing colder every day, and when Heidi stood under the fir\ntrees the wind blew through her as if she was a thin little leaf,\nbut still she felt she could not stay indoors when she heard the\nbranches waving outside.",
        "Then it grew very cold, and Peter would come up early in the\nmorning blowing on his fingers to keep them warm. But he soon\nleft off coming, for one night there was a heavy fall of snow\nand the next morning the whole mountain was covered with it, and\nnot a single little green leaf was to be seen anywhere upon it.\nThere was no Peter that day, and Heidi stood at the little window\nlooking out in wonderment, for the snow was beginning again, and\nthe thick flakes kept falling till the snow was up to the\nwindow, and still they continued to fall, and the snow grew\nhigher, so that at last the window could not be opened, and she\nand her grandfather were shut up fast within the hut. Heidi\nthought this was great fun and ran from one window to the other\nto see what would happen next, and whether the snow was going to\ncover up the whole hut, so that they would have to light a lamp\nalthough it was broad daylight. But things did not get as bad as\nthat, and the next day, the snow having ceased, the grandfather\nwent out and shovelled away the snow round the house, and threw\nit into such great heaps that they looked like mountains standing\nat intervals on either side the hut. And now the windows and door\ncould be opened, and it was well it was so, for as Heidi and her\ngrandfather were sitting one afternoon on their three-legged\nstools before the fire there came a great thump at the door\nfollowed by several others, and then the door opened. It was\nPeter, who had made all that noise knocking the snow off his\nshoes; he was still white all over with it, for he had had to\nfight his way through deep snowdrifts, and large lumps of snow\nthat had frozen upon him still clung to his clothes. He had been\ndetermined, however, not to be beaten and to climb up to the\nhut, for it was a week now since he had seen Heidi.",
        "“Good-evening,” he said as he came in; then he went and placed\nhimself as near the fire as he could without saying another\nword, but his whole face was beaming with pleasure at finding\nhimself there. Heidi looked on in astonishment, for Peter was\nbeginning to thaw all over with the warmth, so that he had the\nappearance of a trickling waterfall.",
        "“Well, General, and how goes it with you?” said the grandfather,\n\"now that you have lost your army you will have to turn to your\npen and pencil.”",
        "“Why must he turn to his pen and pencil?” asked Heidi\nimmediately, full of curiosity.",
        "“During the winter he must go to school,” explained her\ngrandfather, “and learn how to read and write; it’s a bit hard,\nalthough useful sometimes afterwards. Am I not right, General?”",
        "“Yes, indeed,” assented Peter.",
        "Heidi’s interest was now thoroughly awakened, and she had so\nmany questions to put to Peter about all that was to be done and\nseen and heard at school, and the conversation took so long that\nPeter had time to get thoroughly dry. Peter had always great\ndifficulty in putting his thoughts into words, and he found his\nshare of the talk doubly difficult to-day, for by the time he had\nan answer ready to one of Heidi’s questions she had already put\ntwo or three more to him, and generally such as required a whole\nlong sentence in reply.",
        "The grandfather sat without speaking during this conversation,\nonly now and then a twitch of amusement at the corners of his\nmouth showed that he was listening.",
        "“Well, now, General, you have been under fire for some time and\nmust want some refreshment, come and join us,” he said at last,\nand as he spoke he rose and went to fetch the supper out of the\ncupboard, and Heidi pushed the stools to the table. There was\nalso now a bench fastened against the wall, for as he was no\nlonger alone the grandfather had put up seats of various kinds\nhere and there, long enough to hold two persons, for Heidi had a\nway of always keeping close to her grandfather whether he was\nwalking, sitting or standing. So there was comfortable place for\nthem all three, and Peter opened his round eyes very wide when\nhe saw what a large piece of meat Alm-Uncle gave him on his thick\nslice of bread. It was a long time since Peter had had anything\nso nice to eat. As soon as the pleasant meal was over Peter\nbegan to get ready for returning home, for it was already growing\ndark. He had said his “good-night” and his thanks, and was just\ngoing out, when he turned again and said, “I shall come again\nnext Sunday, this day week, and grandmother sent word that she\nwould like you to come and see her one day.”",
        "It was quite a new idea to Heidi that she should go and pay\nanybody a visit, and she could not get it out of her head; so\nthe first thing she said to her grandfather the next day was, “I\nmust go down to see the grandmother to-day; she will be expecting\nme.”",
        "“The snow is too deep,” answered the grandfather, trying to put\nher off. But Heidi had made up her mind to go, since the\ngrandmother had sent her that message. She stuck to her\nintention and not a day passed but what in the course of it she\nsaid five or six times to her grandfather, “I must certainly go\nto-day, the grandmother will be waiting for me.”",
        "On the fourth day, when with every step one took the ground\ncrackled with frost and the whole vast field of snow was hard as\nice, Heidi was sitting on her high stool at dinner with the\nbright sun shining in upon her through the window, and again\nrepeated her little speech, “I must certainly go down to see the\ngrandmother to-day, or else I shall keep her waiting too long.”",
        "The grandfather rose from table, climbed up to the hay-loft and\nbrought down the thick sack that was Heidi’s coverlid, and said,\n\"Come along then!” The child skipped out gleefully after him\ninto the glittering world of snow.",
        "The old fir trees were standing now quite silent, their branches\ncovered with the white snow, and they looked so lovely as they\nglittered and sparkled in the sunlight that Heidi jumped for joy\nat the sight and kept on calling out, “Come here, come here,\ngrandfather! The fir trees are all silver and gold!” The\ngrandfather had gone into the shed and he now came out dragging\na large hand-sleigh along with him; inside it was a low seat, and\nthe sleigh could be pushed forward and guided by the feet of the\none who sat upon it with the help of a pole that was fastened to\nthe side. After he had been taken round the fir trees by Heidi\nthat he might see their beauty from all sides, he got into the\nsleigh and lifted the child on to his lap; then he wrapped her\nup in the sack, that she might keep nice and warm, and put his\nleft arm closely round her, for it was necessary to hold her\ntight during the coming journey. He now grasped the pole with his\nright hand and gave the sleigh a push forward with his two feet.\nThe sleigh shot down the mountain side with such rapidity that\nHeidi thought they were flying through the air like a bird, and\nshouted aloud with delight. Suddenly they came to a standstill,\nand there they were at Peter’s hut. Her grandfather lifted her\nout and unwrapped her. “There you are, now go in, and when it\nbegins to grow dark you must start on your way home again.” Then\nhe left her and went up the mountain, pulling his sleigh after\nhim.",
        "Heidi opened the door of the hut and stepped into a tiny room\nthat looked very dark, with a fireplace and a few dishes on a\nwooden shelf; this was the little kitchen. She opened another\ndoor, and now found herself in another small room, for the place\nwas not a herdsman’s hut like her grandfather’s, with one large\nroom on the ground floor and a hay-loft above, but a very old\ncottage, where everything was narrow and poor and shabby. A\ntable was close to the door, and as Heidi stepped in she saw a\nwoman sitting at it, putting a patch on a waistcoat which Heidi\nrecognised at once as Peter’s. In the corner sat an old woman,\nbent with age, spinning. Heidi was quite sure this was the\ngrandmother, so she went up to the spinning-wheel and said, “Good-\nday, grandmother, I have come at last; did you think I was a long\ntime coming?”",
        "The woman raised her head and felt for the hand that the child\nheld out to her, and when she found it, she passed her own over\nit thoughtfully for a few seconds, and then said, “Are you the\nchild who lives up with Alm-Uncle, are you Heidi?”",
        "“Yes, yes,” answered Heidi, “I have just come down in the sleigh\nwith grandfather.”",
        "“Is it possible! Why your hands are quite warm! Brigitta, did Alm-\nUncle come himself with the child?”",
        "Peter’s mother had left her work and risen from the table and\nnow stood looking at Heidi with curiosity, scanning her from head\nto foot. “I do not know, mother, whether Uncle came himself; it\nis hardly likely, the child probably makes a mistake.”",
        "But Heidi looked steadily at the woman, not at all as if in any\nuncertainty, and said, “I know quite well who wrapped me in my\nbedcover and brought me down in the sleigh: it was grandfather.”",
        "“There was some truth then perhaps in what Peter used to tell us\nof Alm-Uncle during the summer, when we thought he must be\nwrong,” said grandmother; “but who would ever have believed that\nsuch a thing was possible? I did not think the child would live\nthree weeks up there. What is she like, Brigitta?”",
        "The latter had so thoroughly examined Heidi on all sides that\nshe was well able to describe her to her mother.",
        "“She has Adelaide’s slenderness of figure, but her eyes are dark\nand her hair curly like her father’s and the old man’s up there:\nshe takes after both of them, I think.”",
        "Heidi meanwhile had not been idle; she had made the round of the\nroom and looked carefully at everything there was to be seen.\nAll of a sudden she exclaimed, “Grandmother, one of your shutters\nis flapping backwards and forwards; grandfather would put a nail\nin and make it all right in a minute, or else it will break one\nof the panes some day; look, look, how it keeps on banging!”",
        "“Ah, dear child,” said the old woman, “I am not able to see it,\nbut I can hear that and many other things besides the shutter.\nEverything about the place rattles and creaks when the wind is\nblowing, and it gets inside through all the cracks and holes.\nThe house is going to pieces, and in the night, when the two\nothers are asleep, I often lie awake in fear and trembling,\nthinking that the whole place will give way and fall and kill us.\nAnd there is not a creature to mend anything for us, for Peter\ndoes not understand such work.”",
        "“But why cannot you see, grandmother, that the shutter is loose.\nLook, there it goes again, see, that one there!” And Heidi\npointed to the particular shutter.",
        "“Alas, child, it is not only that I cannot see–I can see,\nnothing, nothing,” said the grandmother in a voice of\nlamentation.",
        "“But if I were to go outside and put back the shutter so that\nyou had more light, then you could see, grandmother?”",
        "“No, no, not even then, no one can make it light for me again.”",
        "“But if you were to go outside among all the white snow, then\nsurely you would find it light; just come with me, grandmother,\nand I will show you.” Heidi took hold of the old woman’s hand to\nlead her along, for she was beginning to feel quite distressed\nat the thought of her being without light.",
        "“Let me be, dear child; it is always dark for me now; whether in\nsnow or sun, no light can penetrate my eyes.”",
        "“But surely it does in summer, grandmother,” said Heidi, more\nand more anxious to find some way out of the trouble, “when the\nhot sun is shining down again, and he says good-night to the\nmountains, and they all turn on fire, and the yellow flowers\nshine like gold, then, you will see, it will be bright and\nbeautiful for you again.”",
        "“Ah, child, I shall see the mountains on fire or the yellow\nflowers no more; it will never be light for me again on earth,\nnever.”",
        "At these words Heidi broke into loud crying. In her distress she\nkept on sobbing out, “Who can make it light for you again? Can\nno one do it? Isn’t there any one who can do it?”",
        "The grandmother now tried to comfort the child, but it was not\neasy to quiet her. Heidi did not often weep, but when she did\nshe could not get over her trouble for a long while. The\ngrandmother had tried all means in her power to allay the child’s\ngrief, for it went to her heart to hear her sobbing so bitterly.\nAt last she said, “Come here, dear Heidi, come and let me tell\nyou something. You cannot think how glad one is to hear a kind\nword when one can no longer see, and it is such a pleasure to me\nto listen to you while you talk. So come and sit beside me and\ntell me something; tell me what you do up there, and how\ngrandfather occupies himself. I knew him very well in old days;\nbut for many years now I have heard nothing of him, except\nthrough Peter, who never says much.”",
        "This was a new and happy idea to Heidi; she quickly dried her\ntears and said in a comforting voice, “Wait, grandmother, till I\nhave told grandfather everything, he will make it light for you\nagain, I am sure, and will do something so that the house will\nnot fall; he will put everything right for you.”",
        "The grandmother was silent, and Heidi now began to give her a\nlively description of her life with the grandfather, and of the\ndays she spent on the mountain with the goats, and then went on\nto tell her of what she did now during the winter, and how her\ngrandfather was able to make all sorts of things, seats and\nstools, and mangers where the hay was put for Little Swan and\nLittle Bear, besides a new large water-tub for her to bathe in\nwhen the summer came, and a new milk-bowl and spoon, and Heidi\ngrew more and more animated as she enumerated all the beautiful\nthings which were made so magically out of pieces of wood; she\nthen told the grandmother how she stood by him and watched all\nhe did, and how she hoped some day to be able to make the same\nherself.",
        "The grandmother listened with the greatest attention, only from\ntime to time addressing her daughter, “Do you hear that,\nBrigitta? Do you hear what she is saying about Uncle?”",
        "The conversation was all at once interrupted by a heavy thump on\nthe door, and in marched Peter, who stood stock-still, opening\nhis eyes with astonishment, when he caught sight of Heidi; then\nhis face beamed with smiles as she called out, “Good-evening,\nPeter.”",
        "“What, is the boy back from school already?” exclaimed the\ngrandmother in surprise. “I have not known an afternoon pass so\nquickly as this one for years. How is the reading getting on,\nPeter?”",
        "“Just the same,” was Peter’s answer.",
        "The old woman gave a little sigh. “Ah, well,” she said, “I hoped\nyou would have something different to tell me by this time, as\nyou are going to be twelve years old this February.”",
        "“What was it that you hoped he would have to tell you?” asked\nHeidi, interested in all the grandmother said.",
        "“I mean that he ought to have learnt to read a bit by now,\"\ncontinued the grandmother. “Up there on the shelf is an old\nprayer-book, with beautiful songs in it which I have not heard\nfor a long time and cannot now remember to repeat to myself, and\nI hoped that Peter would soon learn enough to be able to read\none of them to me sometimes; but he finds it too difficult.”",
        "“I must get a light, it is getting too dark to see,” said\nPeter’s mother, who was still busy mending his waistcoat. “I feel\ntoo as if the afternoon had gone I hardly know how.”",
        "Heidi now jumped up from her low chair, and holding out her hand\nhastily to the grandmother said, “Good-night, grandmother, if it\nis getting dark I must go home at once,” and bidding good-bye to\nPeter and his mother she went towards the door. But the\ngrandmother called out in an anxious voice, “Wait, wait, Heidi;\nyou must not go alone like that, Peter must go with you; and\ntake care of the child, Peter, that she does not fall, and don’t\nlet her stand still for fear she should get frozen, do you hear?\nHas she got anything warm to put around her throat?”",
        "“I have not anything to put on,” called back Heidi, “but I am\nsure I shall not be cold,” and with that she ran outside and\nwent off at such a pace that Peter had difficulty in overtaking\nher. The grandmother, still in distress, called out to her\ndaughter, “Run after her, Brigitta; the child will be frozen to\ndeath on such a night as this; take my shawl, run quickly!”",
        "Brigitta ran out. But the children had taken but a few steps\nbefore they saw the grandfather coming down to meet them, and in\nanother minute his long strides had brought him to their side.",
        "“That’s right, Heidi; you have kept your word,” said the\ngrandfather, and then wrapping the sack firmly round her he\nlifted her in his arms and strode off with her up the mountain.\nBrigitta was just in time to see him do all this, and on her\nreturn to the hut with Peter expressed her astonishment to the\ngrandmother. The latter was equally surprised, and kept on\nsaying, “God be thanked that he is good to the child, God be\nthanked! Will he let her come to me again, I wonder! the child\nhas done me so much good. What a loving little heart it is, and\nhow merrily she tells her tale!” And she continued to dwell with\ndelight on the thought of the child until she went to bed, still\nsaying now and again, “If only she will come again! Now I have\nreally something left in the world to take pleasure in.” And\nBrigitta agreed with all her mother said, and Peter nodded his\nhead in approval each time his grandmother spoke, saying, with a\nbroad smile of satisfaction, “I told you so!”",
        "Meanwhile Heidi was chattering away to her grandfather from\ninside her sack; her voice, however, could not reach him through\nthe many thick folds of her wrap, and as therefore it was\nimpossible to understand a word she was saying, he called to\nher, “Wait till we get home, and then you can tell me all about\nit.” They had no sooner got inside the hut than Heidi, having\nbeen released from her covering, at once began what she had to\nsay, “Grandfather, to-morrow we must take the hammer and the long\nnails and fasten grandmother’s shutter, and drive in a lot more\nnails in other places, for her house shakes and rattles all\nover.”",
        "“We must, must we? who told you that?” asked her grandfather.",
        "“Nobody told me, but I know it for all that,” replied Heidi,\n\"for everything is giving way, and when the grandmother cannot\nsleep, she lies trembling for fear at the noise, for she thinks\nthat every minute the house will fall down on their heads; and\neverything now is dark for grandmother, and she does not think\nany one can make it light for her again, but you will be able\nto, I am sure, grandfather. Think how dreadful it is for her to\nbe always in the dark, and then to be frightened at what may\nhappen, and nobody can help her but you. To-morrow we must go and\nhelp her; we will, won’t we, grandfather?”",
        "The child was clinging to the old man and looking up at him in\ntrustful confidence. The grandfather looked down at Heidi for a\nwhile without speaking, and then said, “Yes, Heidi, we will do\nsomething to stop the rattling, at least we can do that; we will\ngo down about it to-morrow!”",
        "The child went skipping round the room for joy, crying out, “We\nshall go to-morrow! we shall go to-morrow!”",
        "The grandfather kept his promise. On the following afternoon he\nbrought the sleigh out again, and as on the previous day, he set\nHeidi down at the door of the grandmother’s hut and said, “Go in\nnow, and when it grows dark, come out again.” Then he put the\nsack in the sleigh and went round the house.",
        "Heidi had hardly opened the door and sprung into the room when\nthe grandmother called out from her corner, “It’s the child\nagain! here she comes!” and in her delight she let the thread\ndrop from her fingers, and the wheel stood still as she\nstretched out both her hands in welcome. Heidi ran to her, and\nthen quickly drew the little stool close up to the old woman, and\nseating herself upon it, began to tell and ask her all kinds of\nthings. All at once came the sound of heavy blows against the\nwall of the hut and the grandmother gave such a start of alarm\nthat she nearly upset the spinning-wheel, and cried in a\ntrembling voice, “Ah, my God, now it is coming, the house is\ngoing to fall upon us!” But Heidi caught her by the arm, and said\nsoothingly, “No, no, grandmother, do not be frightened, it is\nonly grandfather with his hammer; he is mending up everything, so\nthat you shan’t have such fear and trouble.”",
        "“Is it possible! is it really possible! so the dear God has not\nforgotten us!” exclaimed the grandmother. “Do you hear,\nBrigitta, what that noise is? Did you hear what the child says?\nNow, as I listen, I can tell it is a hammer; go outside,\nBrigitta, and if it is Alm-Uncle, tell him he must come inside a\nmoment that I may thank him.”",
        "Brigitta went outside and found Alm-Uncle in the act of\nfastening some heavy pieces of new wood along the wall. She\nstepped up to him and said, “Good-evening, Uncle, mother and I\nhave to thank you for doing us such a kind service, and she would\nlike to tell you herself how grateful she is; I do not know who\nelse would have done it for us; we shall not forget your\nkindness, for I am sure–”",
        "“That will do,” said the old man, interrupting her.",
        "“I know what you think of Alm-Uncle without your telling me. Go\nindoors again, I can find out for myself where the mending is\nwanted.”",
        "Brigitta obeyed on the spot, for Uncle had a way with him that\nmade few people care to oppose his will. He went on knocking\nwith his hammer all round the house, and then mounted the narrow\nsteps to the roof, and hammered away there, until he had used up\nall the nails he had brought with him. Meanwhile it had been\ngrowing dark, and he had hardly come down from the roof and\ndragged the sleigh out from behind the goat-shed when Heidi\nappeared outside. The grandfather wrapped her up and took her in\nhis arms as he had done the day before, for although he had to\ndrag the sleigh up the mountain after him, he feared that if the\nchild sat in it alone her wrappings would fall off and that she\nwould be nearly if not quite frozen, so he carried her warm and\nsafe in his arms.",
        "So the winter went by. After many years of joyless life, the\nblind grandmother had at last found something to make her happy;\nher days were no longer passed in weariness and darkness, one\nlike the other without pleasure or change, for now she had\nalways something to which she could look forward. She listened\nfor the little tripping footstep as soon as day had come, and\nwhen she heard the door open and knew the child was really there,\nshe would call out, “God be thanked, she has come again!” And\nHeidi would sit by her and talk and tell her everything she knew\nin so lively a manner that the grandmother never noticed how the\ntime went by, and never now as formerly asked Brigitta, “Isn’t\nthe day done yet?” but as the child shut the door behind her on\nleaving, would exclaim, “How short the afternoon has seemed;\ndon’t you think so, Brigitta?” And this one would answer, “I do\nindeed; it seems as if I had only just cleared away the mid-day\nmeal.” And the grandmother would continue, “Pray God the child is\nnot taken from me, and that Alm-Uncle continues to let her come!\nDoes she look well and strong, Brigitta?” And the latter would\nanswer, “She looks as bright and rosy as an apple.”",
        "And Heidi had also grown very fond of the old grandmother, and\nwhen at last she knew for certain that no one could make it\nlight for her again, she was overcome with sorrow; but the\ngrandmother told her again that she felt the darkness much less\nwhen Heidi was with her, and so every fine winter’s day the child\ncame travelling down in her sleigh. The grandfather always took\nher, never raising any objection, indeed he always carried the\nhammer and sundry other things down in the sleigh with him, and\nmany an afternoon was spent by him in making the goatherd’s\ncottage sound and tight. It no longer groaned and rattled the\nwhole night through, and the grandmother, who for many winters\nhad not been able to sleep in peace as she did now, said she\nshould never forget what the Uncle had done for her.",
        "Quickly the winter passed, and still more quickly the bright\nglad summer, and now another winter was drawing to its close.\nHeidi was still as light-hearted and happy as the birds, and\nlooked forward with more delight each day to the coming spring,\nwhen the warm south wind would roar through the fir trees and\nblow away the snow, and the warm sun would entice the blue and\nyellow flowers to show their heads, and the long days out on the\nmountain would come again, which seemed to Heidi the greatest\njoy that the earth could give. Heidi was now in her eighth year;\nshe had learnt all kinds of useful things from her grandfather;\nshe knew how to look after the goats as well as any one, and\nLittle Swan and Bear would follow her like two faithful dogs, and\ngive a loud bleat of pleasure when they heard her voice. Twice\nduring the course of this last winter Peter had brought up a\nmessage from the schoolmaster at Dorfli, who sent word to Alm-\nUncle that he ought to send Heidi to school, as she was over the\nusual age, and ought indeed to have gone the winter before. Uncle\nhad sent word back each time that the schoolmaster would find him\nat home if he had anything he wished to say to him, but that he\ndid not intend to send Heidi to school, and Peter had faithfully\ndelivered his message.",
        "When the March sun had melted the snow on the mountain side and\nthe snowdrops were peeping out all over the valley, and the fir\ntrees had shaken off their burden of snow and were again merrily\nwaving their branches in the air, Heidi ran backwards and\nforwards with delight first to the goat-shed then to the fir-\ntrees, and then to the hut-door, in order to let her grandfather\nknow how much larger a piece of green there was under the trees,\nand then would run off to look again, for she could hardly wait\ntill everything was green and the full beautiful summer had\nclothed the mountain with grass and flowers. As Heidi was thus\nrunning about one sunny March morning, and had just jumped over\nthe water-trough for the tenth time at least, she nearly fell\nbackwards into it with fright, for there in front of her, looking\ngravely at her, stood an old gentleman dressed in black. When he\nsaw how startled she was, he said in a kind voice, “Don’t be\nafraid of me, for I am very fond of children. Shake hands! You\nmust be the Heidi I have heard of; where is your grandfather?”",
        "“He is sitting by the table, making round wooden spoons,” Heidi\ninformed him, as she opened the door.",
        "He was the old village pastor from Dorfli who had been a\nneighbor of Uncle’s when he lived down there, and had known him\nwell. He stepped inside the hut, and going up to the old man, who\nwas bending over his work, said, “Good-morning, neighbor.”",
        "The grandfather looked up in surprise, and then rising said,\n\"Good-morning” in return. He pushed his chair towards the\nvisitor as he continued, “If you do not mind a wooden seat there\nis one for you.”",
        "The pastor sat down. “It is a long time since I have seen you,\nneighbor,” he said.",
        "“Or I you,” was the answer.",
        "“I have come to-day to talk over something with you,” continued\nthe pastor. “I think you know already what it is that has\nbrought me here,” and as he spoke he looked towards the child who\nwas standing at the door, gazing with interest and surprise at\nthe stranger.",
        "“Heidi, go off to the goats,” said her grandfather. “You take\nthem a little salt and stay with them till I come.”",
        "Heidi vanished on the spot.",
        "“The child ought to have been at school a year ago, and most\ncertainly this last winter,” said the pastor. “The schoolmaster\nsent you word about it, but you gave him no answer. What are you\nthinking of doing with the child, neighbor?”",
        "“I am thinking of not sending her to school,” was the answer.",
        "The visitor, surprised, looked across at the old man, who was\nsitting on his bench with his arms crossed and a determined\nexpression about his whole person.",
        "“How are you going to let her grow up then?” he asked.",
        "“I am going to let her grow up and be happy among the goats and\nbirds; with them she is safe, and will learn nothing evil.”",
        "“But the child is not a goat or a bird, she is a human being. If\nshe learns no evil from these comrades of hers, she will at the\nsame time learn nothing; but she ought not to grow up in\nignorance, and it is time she began her lessons. I have come now\nthat you may have leisure to think over it, and to arrange about\nit during the summer. This is the last winter that she must be\nallowed to run wild; next winter she must come regularly to\nschool every day.”",
        "“She will do no such thing,” said the old man with calm\ndetermination.",
        "“Do you mean that by no persuasion can you be brought to see\nreason, and that you intend to stick obstinately to your\ndecision?” said the pastor, growing somewhat angry. “You have\nbeen about the world, and must have seen and learnt much, and I\nshould have given you credit for more sense, neighbor.”",
        "“Indeed,” replied the old man, and there was a tone in his voice\nthat betrayed a growing irritation on his part too, “and does\nthe worthy pastor really mean that he would wish me next winter\nto send a young child like that some miles down the mountain on\nice-cold mornings through storm and snow, and let her return at\nnight when the wind is raging, when even one like ourselves\nwould run a risk of being blown down by it and buried in the\nsnow? And perhaps he may not have forgotten the child’s mother,\nAdelaide? She was a sleep-walker, and had fits. Might not the\nchild be attacked in the same way if obliged to over-exert\nherself? And some one thinks they can come and force me to send\nher? I will go before all the courts of justice in the country,\nand then we shall see who will force me to do it!”",
        "“You are quite right, neighbor,” said the pastor in a friendly\ntone of voice. “I see it would have been impossible to send the\nchild to school from here. But I perceive that the child is dear\nto you; for her sake do what you ought to have done long ago:\ncome down into Dorfli and live again among your fellowmen. What\nsort of a life is this you lead, alone, and with bitter thoughts\ntowards God and man! If anything were to happen to you up here\nwho would there be to help you? I cannot think but what you must\nbe half-frozen to death in this hut in the winter, and I do not\nknow how the child lives through it!”",
        "“The child has young blood in her veins and a good roof over her\nhead, and let me further tell the pastor, that I know where wood\nis to be found, and when is the proper time to fetch it; the\npastor can go and look inside my wood-shed; the fire is never\nout in my hut the whole winter through. As to going to live below\nthat is far from my thoughts; the people despise me and I them;\nit is therefore best for all of us that we live apart.”",
        "“No, no, it is not best for you; I know what it is you lack,\"\nsaid the pastor in an earnest voice. “As to the people down\nthere looking on you with dislike, it is not as bad as you think.\nBelieve me, neighbor; seek to make your peace with God, pray for\nforgiveness where you need it, and then come and see how\ndifferently people will look upon you, and how happy you may yet\nbe.”",
        "The pastor had risen and stood holding out his hand to the old\nman as he added with renewed earnestness, “I will wager,\nneighbor, that next winter you will be down among us again, and\nwe shall be good neighbors as of old. I should be very grieved\nif any pressure had to be put upon you; give me your hand and\npromise me that you will come and live with us again and become\nreconciled to God and man.”",
        "Alm-Uncle gave the pastor his hand and answered him calmly and\nfirmly, “You mean well by me I know, but as to that which you\nwish me to do, I say now what I shall continue to say, that I\nwill not send the child to school nor come and live among you.”",
        "“Then God help you!” said the pastor, and he turned sadly away\nand left the hut and went down the mountain.",
        "Alm-Uncle was out of humor. When Heidi said as usual that\nafternoon, “Can we go down to grandmother now?” he answered,\n\"Not to-day.” He did not speak again the whole of that day, and\nthe following morning when Heidi again asked the same question,\nhe replied, “We will see.” But before the dinner bowls had been\ncleared away another visitor arrived, and this time it was\nCousin Dete. She had a fine feathered hat on her head, and a long\ntrailing skirt to her dress which swept the floor, and on the\nfloor of a goatherd’s hut there are all sorts of things that do\nnot belong to a dress.",
        "The grandfather looked her up and down without uttering a word.\nBut Dete was prepared with an exceedingly amiable speech and\nbegan at once to praise the looks of the child. She was looking\nso well she should hardly have known her again, and it was\nevident that she had been happy and well-cared for with her\ngrandfather; but she had never lost sight of the idea of taking\nthe child back again, for she well understood that the little\none must be much in his way, but she had not been able to do it\nat first. Day and night, however, she had thought over the means\nof placing the child somewhere, and that was why she had come to-\nday, for she had just heard of something that would be a lucky\nchance for Heidi beyond her most ambitious hopes. Some immensely\nwealthy relatives of the people she was serving, who had the\nmost splendid house almost in Frankfurt, had an only daughter,\nyoung and an invalid, who was always obliged to go about in a\nwheeled chair; she was therefore very much alone and had no one\nto share her lessons, and so the little girl felt dull. Her\nfather had spoken to Dete’s mistress about finding a companion\nfor her, and her mistress was anxious to help in the matter, as\nshe felt so sympathetic about it. The lady-housekeeper had\ndescribed the sort of child they wanted, simple-minded and\nunspoilt, and not like most of the children that one saw now-a-\ndays. Dete had thought at once of Heidi and had gone off without\ndelay to see the lady-housekeeper, and after Dete had given her a\ndescription of Heidi, she had immediately agreed to take her. And\nno one could tell what good fortune there might not be in store\nfor Heidi, for if she was once with these people and they took a\nfancy to her, and anything happened to their own daughter–one\ncould never tell, the child was so weakly–and they did not feel\nthey could live without a child, why then the most unheard of\nluck–",
        "“Have you nearly finished what you had to say?” broke in Alm-\nUncle, who had allowed her to talk on uninterruptedly so far.",
        "“Ugh!” exclaimed Dete, throwing up her head in disgust, “one\nwould think I had been talking to you about the most ordinary\nmatter; why there is not one person in all Prattigau who would\nnot thank God if I were to bring them such a piece of news as I\nam bringing you.”",
        "“You may take your news to anybody you like, I will have nothing\nto do with it.”",
        "But now Dete leaped up from her seat like a rocket and cried,\n\"If that is all you have to say about it, why then I will give\nyou a bit of my mind. The child is now eight years old and knows\nnothing, and you will not let her learn. You will not send her\nto church or school, as I was told down in Dorfli, and she is my\nown sister’s child. I am responsible for what happens to her, and\nwhen there is such a good opening for a child, as this which\noffers for Heidi, only a person who cares for nobody and never\nwishes good to any one would think of not jumping at it. But I\nam not going to give in, and that I tell you; I have everybody in\nDorfli on my side; there is not one person there who will not\ntake my part against you; and I advise you to think well before\nbringing it into court, if that is your intention; there are\ncertain things which might be brought up against you which you\nwould not care to hear, for when one has to do with law-courts\nthere is a great deal raked up that had been forgotten.”",
        "“Be silent!” thundered the Uncle, and his eyes flashed with\nanger. “Go and be done with you! and never let me see you again\nwith your hat and feather, and such words on your tongue as you\ncome with today!” And with that he strode out of the hut.",
        "“You have made grandfather angry,” said Heidi, and her dark eyes\nhad anything but a friendly expression in them as she looked at\nDete.",
        "“He will soon be all right again; come now,” said Dete\nhurriedly, “and show me where your clothes are.”",
        "“I am not coming,” said Heidi.",
        "“Nonsense,” continued Dete; then altering her tone to one half-\ncoaxing, half-cross, “Come, come, you do not understand any\nbetter than your grandfather; you will have all sorts of good\nthings that you never dreamed of.” Then she went to the cupboard\nand taking out Heidi’s things rolled them up in a bundle. “Come\nalong now, there’s your hat; it is very shabby but will do for\nthe present; put it on and let us make haste off.”",
        "“I am not coming,” repeated Heidi.",
        "“Don’t be so stupid and obstinate, like a goat; I suppose it’s\nfrom the goats you have learnt to be so. Listen to me: you saw\nyour grandfather was angry and heard what he said, that he did\nnot wish to see us ever again; he wants you now to go away with\nme and you must not make him angrier still. You can’t think how\nnice it is at Frankfurt, and what a lot of things you will see,\nand if you do not like it you can come back again; your\ngrandfather will be in a good temper again by that time.”",
        "“Can I return at once and be back home again here this evening?\"\nasked Heidi.",
        "“What are you talking about, come along now! I tell you that you\ncan come back here when you like. To-day we shall go as far as\nMayenfeld, and early to-morrow we shall start in the train, and\nthat will bring you home again in no time when you wish it, for\nit goes as fast as the wind.”",
        "Dete had now got the bundle under her arm and the child by the\nhand, and so they went down the mountain together.",
        "As it was still too early in the year to take his goats out,\nPeter continued to go to school at Dorfli, but now and again he\nstole a holiday, for he could see no use in learning to read,\nwhile to wander about a bit and look for stout sticks which\nmight be wanted some day he thought a far better employment. As\nDete and Heidi neared the grandmother’s hut they met Peter coming\nround the corner; he had evidently been well rewarded that day\nfor his labors, for he was carrying an immense bundle of long\nthick hazel sticks on his shoulders. He stood still and stared\nat the two approaching figures; as they came up to him, he\nexclaimed, “Where are you going, Heidi?”",
        "“I am only just going over to Frankfurt for a little visit with\nDete,” she replied; “but I must first run in to grandmother, she\nwill be expecting me.”",
        "“No, no, you must not stop to talk; it is already too late,\"\nsaid Dete, holding Heidi, who was struggling to get away, fast by\nthe hand. “You can go in when you come back, you must come along\nnow,” and she pulled the child on with her, fearing that if she\nlet her go in Heidi might take it into her head again that she\ndid not wish to come, and that the grandmother might stand by\nher. Peter ran into the hut and banged against the table with\nhis bundle of sticks with such violence that everything in the\nroom shook, and his grandmother leaped up with a cry of alarm\nfrom her spinning-wheel. Peter had felt that he must give vent to\nhis feelings somehow.",
        "“What is the matter? What is the matter?” cried the frightened\nold woman, while his mother, who had also started up from her\nseat at the shock, said in her usual patient manner, “What is\nit, Peter? why do you behave so roughly?”",
        "“Because she is taking Heidi away,” explained Peter.",
        "“Who? who? where to, Peter, where to?” asked the grandmother,\ngrowing still more agitated; but even as she spoke she guessed\nwhat had happened, for Brigitta had told her shortly before that\nshe had seen Dete going up to Alm-Uncle. The old woman rose\nhastily and with trembling hands opened the window and called\nout beseechingly, “Dete, Dete, do not take the child away from\nus! do not take her away!”",
        "The two who were hastening down the mountain heard her voice,\nand Dete evidently caught the words, for she grasped Heidi’s hand\nmore firmly. Heidi struggled to get free, crying, “Grandmother\nis calling, I must go to her.”",
        "But Dete had no intention of letting the child go, and quieted\nher as best she could; they must make haste now, she said, or\nthey would be too late and not able to go on the next day to\nFrankfurt, and there the child would see how delightful it was,\nand Dete was sure would not wish to go back when she was once\nthere. But if Heidi wanted to return home she could do so at\nonce, and then she could take something she liked back to\ngrandmother. This was a new idea to Heidi, and it pleased her so\nmuch that Dete had no longer any difficulty in getting her\nalong.",
        "After a few minutes’ silence, Heidi asked, “What could I take\nback to her?”",
        "“We must think of something nice,” answered Dete; “a soft roll\nof white bread; she would enjoy that, for now she is old she can\nhardly eat the hard, black bread.”",
        "“No, she always gives it back to Peter, telling him it is too\nhard, for I have seen her do it myself,” affirmed Heidi. “Do let\nus make haste, for then perhaps we can get back soon from\nFrankfurt, and I shall be able to give her the white bread to-\nday.” And Heidi started off running so fast that Dete with the\nbundle under her arm could scarcely keep up with her. But she\nwas glad, nevertheless, to get along so quickly, for they were\nnearing Dorfli, where her friends would probably talk and\nquestion in a way that might put other ideas into Heidi’s head.\nSo she went on straight ahead through the village, holding Heidi\ntightly by the hand, so that they might all see that it was on\nthe child’s account she was hurrying along at such a rate. To\nall their questions and remarks she made answer as she passed “I\ncan’t stop now, as you see, I must make haste with the child as\nwe have yet some way to go.”",
        "“Are you taking her away?” “Is she running away from Alm-Uncle?\"\n\"It’s a wonder she is still alive!” “But what rosy cheeks she\nhas!” Such were the words which rang out on all sides, and Dete\nwas thankful that she had not to stop and give any distinct\nanswers to them, while Heidi hurried eagerly forward without\nsaying a word.",
        "From that day forward Alm-Uncle looked fiercer and more\nforbidding than ever when he came down and passed through\nDorfli. He spoke to no one, and looked such an ogre as he came\nalong with his pack of cheeses on his back, his immense stick in\nhis hand, and his thick, frowning eyebrows, that the women would\ncall to their little ones, “Take care! get out of Alm-Uncle’s way\nor he may hurt you!”",
        "The old man took no notice of anybody as he strode through the\nvillage on his way to the valley below, where he sold his\ncheeses and bought what bread and meat he wanted for himself.\nAfter he had passed the villagers all crowded together looking\nafter him, and each had something to say about him; how much\nwilder he looked than usual, how now he would not even respond to\nanybody’s greeting, while they all agreed that it was a great\nmercy the child had got away from him, and had they not all\nnoticed how the child had hurried along as if afraid that her\ngrandfather might be following to take her back? Only the blind\ngrandmother would have nothing to say against him, and told those\nwho came to her to bring her work, or take away what she had\nspun, how kind and thoughtful he had been with the child, how\ngood to her and her daughter, and how many afternoons he had\nspent mending the house which, but for his help, would certainly\nby this time have fallen down over their heads. And all this was\nrepeated down in Dorfli; but most of the people who heard it said\nthat grandmother was too old to understand, and very likely had\nnot heard rightly what was said; as she was blind she was\nprobably also deaf.",
        "Alm-Uncle went no more now to the grandmother’s house, and it\nwas well that he had made it so safe, for it was not touched\nagain for a long time. The days were sad again now for the old\nblind woman, and not one passed but what she would murmur\ncomplainingly, “Alas! all our happiness and pleasure have gone\nwith the child, and now the days are so long and dreary! Pray\nGod, I see Heidi again once more before I die!”",
        "In her home at Frankfurt, Clara, the little daughter of Herr\nSesemann, was lying on the invalid couch on which she spent her\nwhole day, being wheeled in it from room to room. Just now she\nwas in what was known as the study, where, to judge by the\nvarious things standing and lying about, which added to the cosy\nappearance of the room, the family was fond of sitting. A\nhandsome bookcase with glass doors explained why it was called\nthe study, and here evidently the little girl was accustomed to\nhave her lessons.",
        "Clara’s little face was thin and pale, and at this moment her\ntwo soft blue eyes were fixed on the clock, which seemed to her\nto go very slowly this day, and with a slight accent of\nimpatience, which was very rare with her, she asked, “Isn’t it\ntime yet, Fraulein Rottenmeier?”",
        "This lady was sitting very upright at a small work-table, busy\nwith her embroidery. She had on a mysterious-looking loose\ngarment, a large collar or shoulder-cape that gave a certain\nsolemnity to her appearance, which was enhanced by a very lofty\ndome-shaped head dress. For many years past, since the mistress\nof the house had died, the housekeeping and the superintendence\nof the servants had been entrusted by Herr Sesemann to Fraulein\nRottenmeier. He himself was often away from home, and he left\nher in sole charge, with the condition only that his little\ndaughter should have a voice in all matters, and that nothing\nshould be done against her wish.",
        "As Clara was putting her impatient question for the second time,\nDete and Heidi arrived at the front door, and the former\ninquired of the coachman, who had just got down from his box, if\nit was too late to see Fraulein Rottenmeier.",
        "“That’s not my business,” grumbled the coachman; “ring the bell\nin the hall for Sebastian.”",
        "Dete did so, and Sebastian came downstairs; he looked astonished\nwhen he saw her, opening his eyes till they were nearly as big\nas the large round buttons on his coat.",
        "“Is it too late for me to see Fraulein Rottenmeier?” Dete asked\nagain.",
        "“That’s not my business,” answered the man; “ring that other\nbell for the maid Tinette,” and without troubling himself any\nfarther Sebastian disappeared.",
        "Dete rang again. This time Tinette appeared with a spotless\nwhite cap perched on the top of her head and a mocking expression\nof face.",
        "“What is it?” she called from the top of the stairs. Dete\nrepeated her question. Tinette disappeared, but soon came back\nand called down again to Dete, “Come up, she is expecting you.”",
        "Dete and Heidi went upstairs and into the study, Tinette\nfollowing. Dete remained standing politely near the door, still\nholding Heidi tightly by the hand, for she did not know what the\nchild might take it into her head to do amid these new\nsurroundings.",
        "Fraulein Rottenmeier rose slowly and went up to the little new\ncompanion for the daughter of the house, to see what she was\nlike. She did not seem very pleased with her appearance. Heidi\nwas dressed in her plain little woollen frock, and her hat was\nan old straw one bent out of shape. The child looked innocently\nout from beneath it, gazing with unconcealed astonishment at the\nlady’s towering head dress.",
        "“What is your name?” asked Fraulein Rottenmeier, after\nscrutinisingly examining the child for some minutes, while Heidi\nin return kept her eyes steadily fixed upon the lady.",
        "“Heidi,” she answered in a clear, ringing voice.",
        "“What? what? that’s no Christian name for a child; you were not\nchristened that. What name did they give you when you were\nbaptized?” continued Fraulein Rottenmeier.",
        "“I do not remember,” replied Heidi.",
        "“What a way to answer!” said the lady, shaking her head. “Dete,\nis the child a simpleton or only saucy?”",
        "“If the lady will allow me, I will speak for the child, for she\nis very unaccustomed to strangers,” said Dete, who had given\nHeidi a silent poke for making such an unsuitable answer. “She\nis certainly not stupid nor yet saucy, she does not know what it\nmeans even; she speaks exactly as she thinks. To-day she is for\nthe first time in a gentleman’s house and she does not know good\nmanners; but she is docile and very willing to learn, if the\nlady will kindly make excuses for her. She was christened\nAdelaide, after her mother, my sister, who is now dead.”",
        "“Well, that’s a name that one can pronounce,” remarked Fraulein\nRottenmeier. “But I must tell you, Dete, that I am astonished to\nsee so young a child. I told you that I wanted a companion of\nthe same age as the young lady of the house, one who could share\nher lessons, and all her other occupations. Fraulein Clara is now\nover twelve; what age is this child?”",
        "“If the lady will allow me,” began Dete again, in her usual\nfluent manner, “I myself had lost count of her exact age; she is\ncertainly a little younger, but not much; I cannot say\nprecisely, but I think she is ten, or thereabouts.”",
        "“Grandfather told me I was eight,” put in Heidi. Dete gave her\nanother poke, but as the child had not the least idea why she\ndid so she was not at all confused.",
        "“What–only eight!” cried Fraulein Rottenmeier angrily. “Four\nyears too young! Of what use is such a child! And what have you\nlearnt? What books did you have to learn from?”",
        "“None,” said Heidi.",
        "“How? what? How then did you learn to read?” continued the lady.",
        "“I have never learnt to read, or Peter either,” Heidi informed\nher.",
        "“Mercy upon us! you do not know how to read! Is it really so?\"\nexclaimed Fraulein Rottenmeier, greatly horrified. “Is it\npossible–not able to read? What have you learnt then?”",
        "“Nothing,” said Heidi with unflinching truthfulness.",
        "“Young woman,” said the lady to Dete, after having paused for a\nminute or two to recover from her shock, “this is not at all the\nsort of companion you led me to suppose; how could you think of\nbringing me a child like this?”",
        "But Dete was not to be put down so easily, and answered warmly,\n\"If the lady will allow me, the child is exactly what I thought\nshe required; the lady described what she wished for, a child\nunlike all other children, and I could find no other to suit,\nfor the greater number I know are not peculiar, but one very much\nthe same as the other, and I thought this child seemed as if made\nfor the place. But I must go now, for my mistress will be waiting\nfor me; if the lady will permit I will come again soon and see\nhow she is getting on.” And with a bow Dete quickly left the room\nand ran downstairs. Fraulein Rottenmeier stood for a moment taken\naback and then ran after Dete. If the child was to stop she had\nmany things yet to say and ask about her, and there the child\nwas, and what was more, Dete, as she plainly saw, meant to leave\nher there.",
        "Heidi remained by the door where she had been standing since she\nfirst came in. Clara had looked on during the interview without\nspeaking; now she beckoned to Heidi and said, “Come here!”",
        "Heidi went up to her.",
        "“Would you rather be called Heidi or Adelaide?” asked Clara.",
        "“I am never called anything but Heidi,” was the child’s prompt\nanswer.",
        "“Then I shall always call you by that name,” said Clara, “it\nsuits you. I have never heard it before, but neither have I ever\nseen a child like you before. Have you always had that short\ncurly hair?”",
        "“Yes, I think so,” said Heidi.",
        "“Are you pleased to come to Frankfurt?” went on Clara.",
        "“No, but I shall go home to-morrow and take grandmother a white\nloaf,” explained Heidi.",
        "“Well, you are a funny child!” exclaimed Clara. “You were\nexpressly sent for to come here and to remain with me and share\nmy lessons; there will be some fun about them now as you cannot\nread, something new to do, for often they are dreadfully dull,\nand I think the morning will never pass away. You know my tutor\ncomes every morning at about ten o’clock, and then we go on with\nlessons till two, and it does seem such a long time. Sometimes\nhe takes up the book and holds it close up to his face, as if he\nwas very short-sighted, but I know it’s only because he wants so\ndreadfully to gape, and Fraulein Rottenmeier takes her large\nhandkerchief out also now and then and covers her face with it,\nas if she was moved by what we had been reading, but that is\nonly because she is longing to gape too. And I myself often want\nto gape, but I am obliged to stop myself, for if Fraulein\nRottenmeier sees me gaping she runs off at once and fetches the\ncod-liver oil and says I must have a dose, as I am getting weak\nagain, and the cod-liver oil is horrible, so I do my best not to\ngape. But now it will be much more amusing, for I shall be able\nto lie and listen while you learn to read.”",
        "Heidi shook her head doubtfully when she heard of learning to\nread.",
        "“Oh, nonsense, Heidi, of course you must learn to read,\neverybody must, and my tutor is very kind, and never cross, and\nhe will explain everything to you. But mind, when he explains\nanything to you, you won’t be able to understand; but don’t ask\nany questions, or else he will go on explaining and you will\nunderstand less than ever. Later when you have learnt more and\nknow about things yourself, then you will begin to understand\nwhat he meant.”",
        "Fraulein Rottenmeier now came back into the room; she had not\nbeen able to overtake Dete, and was evidently very much put out;\nfor she had wanted to go into more details concerning the child,\nand to convince Dete how misleading she had been, and how unfit\nHeidi was as a companion for Clara; she really did not know what\nto be about, or how to undo the mischief, and it made her all\nthe more angry that she herself was responsible for it, having\nconsented to Heidi being fetched. She ran backwards and forwards\nin a state of agitation between the study and the dining-room,\nand then began scolding Sebastian, who was standing looking at\nthe table he had just finished laying to see that nothing was\nmissing.",
        "“You can finish your thoughts to-morrow morning; make haste, or\nwe shall get no dinner to-day at all.”",
        "Then hurrying out she called Tinette, but in such an ill-\ntempered voice that the maid came tripping forward with even more\nmincing steps than usual, but she looked so pert that even\nFraulein Rottenmeier did not venture to scold her, which only\nmade her suppressed anger the greater.",
        "“See that the room is prepared for the little girl who has just\narrived,” said the lady, with a violent effort at self-control.\n\"Everything is ready; it only wants dusting.”",
        "“It’s worth my troubling about,” said Tinette mockingly as she\nturned away.",
        "Meanwhile Sebastian had flung open the folding doors leading\ninto the dining-room with rather more noise than he need, for he\nwas feeling furious, although he did not dare answer back when\nFraulein Rottenmeier spoke to him; he then went up to Clara’s\nchair to wheel her into the next room. As he was arranging the\nhandle at the back preparatory to doing so, Heidi went near and\nstood staring at him. Seeing her eyes fixed upon him, he\nsuddenly growled out, “Well, what is there in me to stare at like\nthat?” which he would certainly not have done if he had been\naware that Fraulein Rottenmeier was just then entering the room.\n\"You look so like Peter,” answered Heidi. The lady-housekeeper\nclasped her hands in horror. “Is it possible!” she stammered half-\naloud, “she is now addressing the servant as if he were a friend!\nI never could have imagined such a child!”",
        "Sebastian wheeled the couch into the dining-room and helped\nClara on to her chair. Fraulein Rottenmeier took the seat beside\nher and made a sign to Heidi to take the one opposite. They were\nthe only three at table, and as they sat far apart there was\nplenty of room for Sebastian to hand his dishes. Beside Heidi’s\nplate lay a nice white roll, and her eyes lighted up with\npleasure as she saw it. The resemblance which Heidi had noticed\nhad evidently awakened in her a feeling of confidence towards\nSebastian, for she sat as still as a mouse and without moving\nuntil he came up to her side and handed her the dish of fish;\nthen she looked at the roll and asked, “Can I have it?” Sebastian\nnodded, throwing a side glance at Fraulein Rottenmeier to see\nwhat effect this request would have upon her. Heidi immediately\nseized the roll and put it in her pocket. Sebastian’s face became\nconvulsed, he was overcome with inward laughter but knew his\nplace too well to laugh aloud. Mute and motionless he still\nremained standing beside Heidi; it was not his duty to speak, nor\nto move away until she had helped herself. Heidi looked\nwonderingly at him for a minute or two, and then said, “Am I to\neat some of that too?” Sebastian nodded again. “Give me some\nthen,” she said, looking calmly at her plate. At this Sebastian’s\ncommand of his countenance became doubtful, and the dish began to\ntremble suspiciously in his hands.",
        "“You can put the dish on the table and come back presently,\"\nsaid Fraulein Rottenmeier with a severe expression of face.\nSebastian disappeared on the spot. “As for you, Adelaide, I see I\nshall have to teach you the first rules of behavior,” continued\nthe lady-housekeeper with a sigh. “I will begin by explaining to\nyou how you are to conduct yourself at table,” and she went on to\ngive Heidi minute instructions as to all she was to do. “And\nnow,” she continued, “I must make you particularly understand\nthat you are not to speak to Sebastian at table, or at any other\ntime, unless you have an order to give him, or a necessary\nquestion to put to him; and then you are not to address him as\nif he was some one belonging to you. Never let me hear you speak\nto him in that way again! It is the same with Tinette, and for\nmyself you are to address me as you hear others doing. Clara\nmust herself decide what you are to call her.”",
        "“Why, Clara, of course,” put the latter. Then followed a long\nlist of rules as to general behavior, getting up and going to\nbed, going in and out of the room, shutting the doors, keeping\neverything tidy, during the course of which Heidi’s eyes\ngradually closed, for she had been up before five o’clock that\nmorning and had had a long journey. She leant back in her chair\nand fell fast asleep. Fraulein Rottenmeier having at last come\nto the end of her sermonizing said, “Now remember what I have\nsaid, Adelaide! Have you understood it all?”",
        "“Heidi has been asleep for ever so long,” said Clara, her face\nrippling all over with amusement, for she had not had such an\nentertaining dinner for a long time.",
        "“It is really insupportable what one has to go through with this\nchild,” exclaimed Fraulein Rottenmeier, in great indignation,\nand she rang the bell so violently that Tinette and Sebastian\nboth came running in and nearly tumbling over one another; but no\nnoise was sufficient to wake Heidi, and it was with difficulty\nthey could rouse her sufficiently to get her along to her\nbedroom, to reach which she had to pass first through the study,\nthen through Clara’s bedroom, then through Fraulein Rottenmeier’s\nsitting-room, till she came to the corner room that had been set\napart for her.",
        "When Heidi opened her eyes on her first morning in Frankfurt she\ncould not think where she was. Then she rubbed them and looked\nabout her. She was sitting up in a high white bed, on one side\nof a large, wide room, into which the light was falling through\nvery, very long white curtains; near the window stood two chairs\ncovered with large flowers, and then came a sofa with the same\nflowers, in front of which was a round table; in the corner was\na washstand, with things upon it that Heidi had never seen in her\nlife before. But now all at once she remembered that she was in\nFrankfurt; everything that had happened the day before came back\nto her, and finally she recalled clearly the instructions that\nhad been given her by the lady-housekeeper, as far as she had\nheard them. Heidi jumped out of bed and dressed herself; then\nshe ran first to one window and then another; she wanted to see\nthe sky and country outside; she felt like a bird in a cage\nbehind those great curtains. But they were too heavy for her to\nput aside, so she crept underneath them to get to the window. But\nthese again were so high that she could only just get her head\nabove the sill to peer out. Even then she could not see what she\nlonged for. In vain she went first to one and then the other of\nthe windows–she could see nothing but walls and windows and\nagain walls and windows. Heidi felt quite frightened. It was\nstill early, for Heidi was accustomed to get up early and run\nout at once to see how everything was looking, if the sky was\nblue and if the sun was already above the mountains, or if the\nfir trees were waving and the flowers had opened their eyes. As a\nbird, when it first finds itself in its bright new cage, darts\nhither and thither, trying the bars in turn to see if it cannot\nget through them and fly again into the open, so Heidi continued\nto run backwards and forwards, trying to open first one and then\nthe other of the windows, for she felt she could not bear to see\nnothing but walls and windows, and somewhere outside there must\nbe the green grass, and the last unmelted snows on the mountain\nslopes, which Heidi so longed to see. But the windows remained\nimmovable, try what Heidi would to open them, even endeavoring\nto push her little fingers under them to lift them up; but it was\nall no use. When after a while Heidi saw that her efforts were\nfruitless, she gave up trying, and began to think whether she\nwould not go out and round the house till she came to the grass,\nbut then she remembered that the night before she had only seen\nstones in front of the house. At that moment a knock came to the\ndoor, and immediately after Tinette put her head inside and\nsaid, “Breakfast is ready.” Heidi had no idea what an invitation\nso worded meant, and Tinette’s face did not encourage any\nquestioning on Heidi’s part, but rather the reverse. Heidi was\nsharp enough to read its expression, and acted accordingly. So\nshe drew the little stool out from under the table, put it in\nthe corner and sat down upon it, and there silently awaited what\nwould happen next. Shortly after, with a good deal of rustling\nand bustling Fraulein Rottenmeier appeared, who again seemed\nvery much put out and called to Heidi, “What is the matter with\nyou, Adelheid? Don’t you understand what breakfast is? Come along\nat once!”",
        "Heidi had no difficulty in understanding now and followed at\nonce. Clara had been some time at the breakfast table and she\ngave Heidi a kindly greeting, her face looking considerably more\ncheerful than usual, for she looked forward to all kinds of new\nthings happening again that day. Breakfast passed off quietly;\nHeidi ate her bread and butter in a perfectly correct manner,\nand when the meal was over and Clara wheeled back into the study,\nFraulein Rottenmeier told her to follow and remain with Clara\nuntil the tutor should arrive and lessons begin.",
        "As soon as the children were alone again, Heidi asked, “How can\none see out from here, and look right down on to the ground?”",
        "“You must open the window and look out,” replied Clara amused.",
        "“But the windows won’t open,” responded Heidi sadly.",
        "“Yes, they will,” Clara assured her. “You cannot open them, nor\nI either, but when you see Sebastian you can ask him to open\none.”",
        "It was a great relief to Heidi to know that the windows could be\nopened and that one could look out, for she still felt as if she\nwas shut up in prison. Clara now began to ask her questions\nabout her home, and Heidi was delighted to tell her all about the\nmountain and the goats, and the flowery meadows which were so\ndear to her.",
        "Meanwhile her tutor had arrived; Fraulein Rottenmeier, however,\ndid not bring him straight into the study but drew him first\naside into the dining-room, where she poured forth her troubles\nand explained to him the awkward position in which she was\nplaced, and how it had all come about. It appeared that she had\nwritten some time back to Herr Sesemann to tell him that his\ndaughter very much wished to have a companion, and had added how\ndesirable she thought it herself, as it would be a spur to Clara\nat her lessons and an amusement for her in her playtime.\nFraulein Rottenmeier had privately wished for this arrangement on\nher own behalf, as it would relieve her from having always to\nentertain the sick girl herself, which she felt at times was too\nmuch for her. The father had answered that he was quite willing\nto let his daughter have a companion, provided she was treated in\nevery way like his own child, as he would not have any child\ntormented or put upon, “which was a very unnecessary remark,” put\nin Fraulein Rottenmeier, “for who wants to torment children!” But\nnow she went on to explain how dreadfully she had been taken in\nabout the child, and related all the unimaginable things of which\nshe had already been guilty, so that not only would he have to\nbegin with teaching her the A B C, but would have to start with\nthe most rudimentary instruction as regarded everything to do\nwith daily life. She could see only one way out of this\ndisastrous state of affairs, and that was for the tutor to\ndeclare that it was impossible for the two to learn together\nwithout detriment to Clara, who was so far ahead of the other;\nthat would be a valid excuse for getting rid of the child, and\nHerr Sesemann would be sure to agree to the child being sent home\nagain, but she dared not do this without his order, since he was\naware that by this time the companion had arrived. But the tutor\nwas a cautious man and not inclined to take a partial view of\nmatters. He tried to calm Fraulein Rottenmeier, and gave it as\nhis opinion that if the little girl was backward in some things\nshe was probably advanced in others, and a little regular\nteaching would soon set the balance right. When Fraulein\nRottenmeier saw that he was not ready to support her, and\nevidently quite ready to undertake teaching the alphabet, she\nopened the study door, which she quickly shut again as soon as he\nhad gone through, remaining on the other side herself, for she\nhad a perfect horror of the A B C. She walked up and down the\ndining-room, thinking over in her own mind how the servants were\nto be told to address Adelaide. The father had written that she\nwas to be treated exactly like his own daughter, and this would\nespecially refer, she imagined, to the servants. She was not\nallowed, however, a very long interval of time for consideration,\nfor suddenly the sound of a frightful crash was heard in the\nstudy, followed by frantic cries for Sebastian. She rushed into\nthe room. There on the floor lay in a confused heap, books,\nexercise-books, inkstand, and other articles with the table-cloth\non the top, while from beneath them a dark stream of ink was\nflowing all across the floor. Heidi had disappeared.",
        "“Here’s a state of things!” exclaimed Fraulein Rottenmeier,\nwringing her hands. “Table-cloth, books, work-basket, everything\nlying in the ink! It was that unfortunate child, I suppose!”",
        "The tutor was standing looking down at the havoc in distress;\nthere was certainly only one view to be taken of such a matter\nas this and that an unfavorable one. Clara meanwhile appeared to\nfind pleasure in such an unusual event and in watching the\nresults. “Yes, Heidi did it,” she explained, “but quite by\naccident; she must on no account be punished; she jumped up in\nsuch violent haste to get away that she dragged the tablecloth\nalong with her, and so everything went over. There were a number\nof vehicles passing, that is why she rushed off like that;\nperhaps she has never seen a carriage.”",
        "“Is it not as I said? She has not the smallest notion about\nanything! not the slightest idea that she ought to sit still and\nlisten while her lessons are going on. But where is the child\nwho has caused all this trouble? Surely she has not run away!\nWhat would Herr Sesemann say to me?” She ran out of the room and\ndown the stairs. There, at the bottom, standing in the open door-\nway, was Heidi, looking in amazement up and down the street.",
        "“What are you doing? What are you thinking of to run away like\nthat?” called Fraulein Rottenmeier.",
        "“I heard the sound of the fir trees, but I cannot see where they\nare, and now I cannot hear them any more,” answered Heidi,\nlooking disappointedly in the direction whence the noise of the\npassing carriages had reached her, and which to Heidi had seemed\nlike the blowing of the south wind in the trees, so that in\ngreat joy of heart she had rushed out to look at them.",
        "“Fir trees! do you suppose we are in a wood? What ridiculous\nideas are these? Come upstairs and see the mischief you have\ndone!”",
        "Heidi turned and followed Fraulein Rottenmeier upstairs; she was\nquite astonished to see the disaster she had caused, for in her\njoy and haste to get to the fir trees she had been unaware of\nhaving dragged everything after her.",
        "“I excuse you doing this as it is the first time, but do not let\nme know you doing it a second time,” said Fraulein Rottenmeier,\npointing to the floor. “During your lesson time you are to sit\nstill and attend. If you cannot do this I shall have to tie you\nto your chair. Do you understand?”",
        "“Yes,” replied Heidi, “but I will certainly not move again,” for\nnow she understood that it was a rule to sit still while she was\nbeing taught.",
        "Sebastian and Tinette were now sent for to clear up the broken\narticles and put things in order again; the tutor said good-\nmorning and left, as it was impossible to do any more lessons\nthat day; there had been certainly no time for gaping this\nmorning.",
        "Clara had to rest for a certain time during the afternoon, and\nduring this interval, as Fraulein Rottenmeier informed Heidi,\nthe latter might amuse herself as she liked. When Clara had been\nplaced on her couch after dinner, and the lady-housekeeper had\nretired to her room, Heidi knew that her time had come to choose\nher own occupation. It was just what she was longing for, as\nthere was something she had made up her mind to do; but she\nwould require some help for its accomplishment, and in view of\nthis she took her stand in the hall in front of the dining-room\ndoor in order to intercept the person she wanted. In a few\nminutes up came Sebastian from the kitchen with a tray of silver\ntea-things, which he had to put away in the dining-room cupboard.\nAs he reached the top stairs Heidi went up to him and addressed\nhim in the formal manner she had been ordered to use by Fraulein\nRottenmeier.",
        "Sebastian looked surprised and said somewhat curtly, “What is it\nyou want, miss?”",
        "“I only wished to ask you something, but it is nothing bad like\nthis morning,” said Heidi, anxious to conciliate him, for she\nsaw that Sebastian was rather in a cross temper, and quite\nthought that it was on account of the ink she had spilt on the\nfloor.",
        "“Indeed, and why, I should first like to know, do you address me\nlike that?” replied Sebastian, evidently still put out.",
        "“Fraulein Rottenmeier told me always to speak to you like that,\"\nsaid Heidi.",
        "Then Sebastian laughed, which very much astonished Heidi, who\nhad seen nothing amusing in the conversation, but Sebastian, now\nhe understood that the child was only obeying orders, added in a\nfriendly voice, “What is it then that miss wants?”",
        "It was now Heidi’s turn to be a little put out, and she said,\n\"My name is not miss, it is Heidi.”",
        "“Quite so, but the same lady has ordered me to call you miss,\"\nexplained Sebastian.",
        "“Has she? oh, then I must be called so,” said Heidi\nsubmissively, for she had already noticed that whatever Fraulein\nRottenmeier said was law. “Then now I have three names,” she\nadded with a sigh.",
        "“What was it little miss wished to ask?” said Sebastian as he\nwent on into the dining-room to put away his silver.",
        "“How can a window be opened?”",
        "“Why, like that!” and Sebastian flung up one of the large\nwindows.",
        "Heidi ran to it, but she was not tall enough to see out, for her\nhead only reached the sill.",
        "“There, now miss can look out and see what is going on below,\"\nsaid Sebastian as he brought her a high wooden stool to stand\non.",
        "Heidi climbed up, and at last, as she thought, was going to see\nwhat she had been longing for. But she drew back her head with a\nlook of great disappointment on her face.",
        "“Why, there is nothing outside but the stony streets,” she said\nmournfully; “but if I went right round to the other side of the\nhouse what should I see there, Sebastian?”",
        "“Nothing but what you see here,” he told her.",
        "“Then where can I go to see right away over the whole valley?”",
        "“You would have to climb to the top of a high tower, a church\ntower, like that one over there with the gold ball above it.\nFrom there you can see right away ever so far.”",
        "Heidi climbed down quickly from her stool, ran to the door, down\nthe steps and out into the street. Things were not, however,\nquite so easy as she thought. Looking from the window the tower\nhad appeared so close that she imagined she had only to run over\nthe road to reach it. But now, although she ran along the whole\nlength of the street, she still did not get any nearer to it,\nand indeed soon lost sight of it altogether; she turned down\nanother street, and went on and on, but still no tower. She\npassed a great many people, but they all seemed in such a hurry\nthat Heidi thought they had not time to tell her which way to go.\nThen suddenly at one of the street corners she saw a boy\nstanding, carrying a hand-organ on his back and a funny-looking\nanimal on his arm. Heidi ran up to him and said, “Where is the\ntower with the gold ball on the top?”",
        "“I don’t know,” was the answer.",
        "“Who can I ask to show me?” she asked again.",
        "“I don’t know.”",
        "“Do you know any other church with a high tower?”",
        "“Yes, I know one.”",
        "“Come then and show it me.”",
        "“Show me first what you will give me for it,” and the boy held\nout his hand as he spoke. Heidi searched about in her pockets\nand presently drew out a card on which was painted a garland of\nbeautiful red roses; she looked at it first for a moment or two,\nfor she felt rather sorry to part with it; Clara had only that\nmorning made her a present of it–but then, to look down into\nthe valley and see all the lovely green slopes! “There,” said\nHeidi, holding out the card, “would you like to have that?”",
        "The boy drew back his hand and shook his head.",
        "“What would you like then?” asked Heidi, not sorry to put the\ncard back in her pocket.",
        "“Money.”",
        "“I have none, but Clara has; I am sure she will give me some;\nhow much do you want?”",
        "“Twopence.”",
        "“Come along then.”",
        "They started off together along the street, and on the way Heidi\nasked her companion what he was carrying on his back; it was a\nhand-organ, he told her, which played beautiful music when he\nturned the handle. All at once they found themselves in front of\nan old church with a high tower; the boy stood still, and said,\n\"There it is.”",
        "“But how shall I get inside?” asked Heidi, looking at the fast\nclosed doors.",
        "“I don’t know,” was the answer.",
        "“Do you think that I can ring as they do for Sebastian?”",
        "“I don’t know.”",
        "Heidi had by this time caught sight of a bell in the wall which\nshe now pulled with all her might. “If I go up you must stay\ndown here, for I do not know the way back, and you will have to\nshow me.”",
        "“What will you give me then for that?”",
        "“What do you want me to give you?”",
        "“Another twopence.”",
        "They heard the key turning inside, and then some one pulled open\nthe heavy creaking door; an old man came out and at first looked\nwith surprise and then in anger at the children, as he began\nscolding them: “What do you mean by ringing me down like this?\nCan’t you read what is written over the bell, ’For those who\nwish to go up the tower’?”",
        "The boy said nothing but pointed his finger at Heidi. The latter\nanswered, “But I do want to go up the tower.”",
        "“What do you want up there?” said the old man. “Has somebody\nsent you?”",
        "“No,” replied Heidi, “I only wanted to go up that I might look\ndown.”",
        "“Get along home with you and don’t try this trick on me again,\nor you may not come off so easily a second time,” and with that\nhe turned and was about to shut the door. But Heidi took hold of\nhis coat and said beseechingly, “Let me go up, just once.”",
        "He looked around, and his mood changed as he saw her pleading\neyes; he took hold of her hand and said kindly, “Well, if you\nreally wish it so much, I will take you.”",
        "The boy sat down on the church steps to show that he was content\nto wait where he was.",
        "Hand in hand with the old man Heidi went up the many steps of\nthe tower; they became smaller and smaller as they neared the\ntop, and at last came one very narrow one, and there they were at\nthe end of their climb. The old man lifted Heidi up that she\nmight look out of the open window.",
        "“There, now you can look down,” he said.",
        "Heidi saw beneath her a sea of roofs, towers, and chimney-pots;\nshe quickly drew back her head and said in a sad, disappointed\nvoice, “It is not at all what I thought.”",
        "“You see now, a child like you does not understand anything\nabout a view! Come along down and don’t go ringing at my bell\nagain!”",
        "He lifted her down and went on before her down the narrow\nstairway. To the left of the turn where it grew wider stood the\ndoor of the tower-keeper’s room, and the landing ran out beside\nit to the edge of the steep slanting roof. At the far end of\nthis was a large basket, in front of which sat a big grey cat,\nthat snarled as it saw them, for she wished to warn the passers-\nby that they were not to meddle with her family. Heidi stood\nstill and looked at her in astonishment, for she had never seen\nsuch a monster cat before; there were whole armies of mice,\nhowever, in the old tower, so the cat had no difficulty in\ncatching half a dozen for her dinner every day. The old man\nseeing Heidi so struck with admiration said, “She will not hurt\nyou while I am near; come, you can have a peep at the kittens.”",
        "Heidi went up to the basket and broke out into expressions of\ndelight.",
        "“Oh, the sweet little things! the darling kittens,” she kept on\nsaying, as she jumped from side to side of the basket so as, not\nto lose any of the droll gambols of the seven or eight little\nkittens that were scrambling and rolling and falling over one\nanother.",
        "“Would you like to have one?” said the old man, who enjoyed\nwatching the child’s pleasure.",
        "“For myself to keep?” said Heidi excitedly, who could hardly\nbelieve such happiness was to be hers.",
        "“Yes, of course, more than one if you like–in short, you can\ntake away the whole lot if you have room for them,” for the old\nman was only too glad to think he could get rid of his kittens\nwithout more trouble.",
        "Heidi could hardly contain herself for joy. There would be\nplenty of room for them in the large house, and then how\nastonished and delighted Clara would be when she saw the sweet\nlittle kittens.",
        "“But how can I take them with me?” asked Heidi, and was going\nquickly to see how many she could carry away in her hands, when\nthe old cat sprang at her so fiercely that she shrank back in\nfear.",
        "“I will take them for you if you will tell me where,” said the\nold man, stroking the cat to quiet her, for she was an old\nfriend of his that had lived with him in the tower for many\nyears.",
        "“To Herr Sesemann’s, the big house where there is a gold dog’s\nhead on the door, with a ring in its mouth,” explained Heidi.",
        "Such full directions as these were not really needed by the old\nman, who had had charge of the tower for many a long year and\nknew every house far and near, and moreover Sebastian was an\nacquaintance of his.",
        "“I know the house,” he said, “but when shall I bring them, and\nwho shall I ask for?–you are not one of the family, I am sure.”",
        "“No, but Clara will be so delighted when I take her the\nkittens.”",
        "The old man wished now to go downstairs, but Heidi did not know\nhow to tear herself away from the amusing spectacle.",
        "“If I could just take one or two away with me! one for myself\nand one for Clara, may I?”",
        "“Well, wait a moment,” said the man, and he drew the cat\ncautiously away into his room, and leaving her by a bowl of food\ncame out again and shut the door. “Now take two of them.”",
        "Heidi’s eyes shone with delight. She picked up a white kitten\nand another striped white and yellow, and put one in the right,\nthe other in the left pocket. Then she went downstairs. The boy\nwas still sitting outside on the steps, and as the old man shut\nthe door of the church behind them, she said, “Which is our way\nto Herr Sesemann’s house?”",
        "“I don’t know,” was the answer.",
        "Heidi began a description of the front door and the steps and\nthe windows, but the boy only shook his head, and was not any the\nwiser.",
        "“Well, look here,” continued Heidi, “from one window you can see\na very, very large grey house, and the roof runs like this–\"\nand Heidi drew a zigzag line in the air with her forefinger.",
        "With this the boy jumped up, he was evidently in the habit of\nguiding himself by similar landmarks. He ran straight off with\nHeidi after him, and in a very short time they had reached the\ndoor with the large dog’s head for the knocker. Heidi rang the\nbell. Sebastian opened it quickly, and when he saw it was Heidi,\n\"Make haste! make haste,” he cried in a hurried voice.",
        "Heidi sprang hastily in and Sebastian shut the door after her,\nleaving the boy, whom he had not noticed, standing in wonder on\nthe steps.",
        "“Make haste, little miss,” said Sebastian again; “go straight\ninto the dining-room, they are already at table; Fraulein\nRottenmeier looks like a loaded cannon. What could make the\nlittle miss run off like that?”",
        "Heidi walked into the room. The lady housekeeper did not look\nup, Clara did not speak; there was an uncomfortable silence.\nSebastian pushed her chair up for her, and when she was seated\nFraulein Rottenmeier, with a severe countenance, sternly and\nsolemnly addressed her: “I will speak with you afterwards,\nAdelheid, only this much will I now say, that you behaved in a\nmost unmannerly and reprehensible way by running out of the\nhouse as you did, without asking permission, without any one\nknowing a word about it; and then to go wandering about till this\nhour; I never heard of such behavior before.”",
        "“Miau!” came the answer back.",
        "This was too much for the lady’s temper; with raised voice she\nexclaimed, “You dare, Adelheid, after your bad behavior, to\nanswer me as if it were a joke?”",
        "“I did not–” began Heidi–\"Miau! miau!”",
        "Sebastian almost dropped his dish and rushed out of the room.",
        "“That will do,” Fraulein Rottenmeier tried to say, but her voice\nwas almost stifled with anger. “Get up and leave the room.”",
        "Heidi stood up frightened, and again made an attempt to explain.\n\"I really did not–” “Miau! miau! miau!”",
        "“But, Heidi,” now put in Clara, “when you see that it makes\nFraulein Rottenmeier angry, why do you keep on saying miau?”",
        "“It isn’t I, it’s the kittens,” Heidi was at last given time to\nsay.",
        "“How! what! kittens!” shrieked Fraulein Rottenmeier. “Sebastian!\nTinette! Find the horrid little things! take them away!” And she\nrose and fled into the study and locked the door, so as to make\nsure that she was safe from the kittens, which to her were the\nmost horrible things in creation.",
        "Sebastian was obliged to wait a few minutes outside the door to\nget over his laughter before he went into the room again. He\nhad, while serving Heidi, caught sight of a little kitten’s head\npeeping out of her pocket, and guessing the scene that would\nfollow, had been so overcome with amusement at the first miaus\nthat he had hardly been able to finish handing the dishes. The\nlady’s distressed cries for help had ceased before he had\nsufficiently regained his composure to go back into the dining-\nroom. It was all peace and quietness there now, Clara had the\nkittens on her lap, and Heidi was kneeling beside her, both\nlaughing and playing with the tiny, graceful little animals.",
        "“Sebastian,” exclaimed Clara as he came in, “you must help us;\nyou must find a bed for the kittens where Fraulein Rottenmeier\nwill not spy them out, for she is so afraid of them that she\nwill send them away at once; but we want to keep them, and have\nthem out whenever we are alone. Where can you put them?”",
        "“I will see to that,” answered Sebastian willingly. “I will make\na bed in a basket and put it in some place where the lady is not\nlikely to go; you leave it to me.” He set about the work at\nonce, sniggling to himself the while, for he guessed there would\nbe a further rumpus about this some day, and Sebastian was not\nwithout a certain pleasure in the thought of Fraulein Rottenmeier\nbeing a little disturbed.",
        "Not until some time had elapsed, and it was nearing the hour for\ngoing to bed, did Fraulein Rottenmeier venture to open the door\na crack and call through, “Have you taken those dreadful little\nanimals away, Sebastian?”",
        "He assured her twice that he had done so; he had been hanging\nabout the room in anticipation of this question, and now quickly\nand quietly caught up the kittens from Clara’s lap and\ndisappeared with them.",
        "The castigatory sermon which Fraulein Rottenmeier had held in\nreserve for Heidi was put off till the following day, as she\nfelt too exhausted now after all the emotions she had gone\nthrough of irritation, anger, and fright, of which Heidi had\nunconsciously been the cause. She retired without speaking, Clara\nand Heidi following, happy in their minds at knowing that the\nkittens were lying in a comfortable bed.",
        "Sebastian had just shown the tutor into the study on the\nfollowing morning when there came another and very loud ring at\nthe bell, which Sebastian ran quickly to answer. “Only Herr\nSesemann rings like that,” he said to himself; “he must have\nreturned home unexpectedly.” He pulled open the door, and there\nin front of him he saw a ragged little boy carrying a hand-organ\non his back.",
        "“What’s the meaning of this?” said Sebastian angrily. “I’ll\nteach you to ring bells like that! What do you want here?”",
        "“I want to see Clara,” the boy answered.",
        "“You dirty, good-for-nothing little rascal, can’t you be polite\nenough to say ’Miss Clara’? What do you want with her?\"\ncontinued Sebastian roughly. “She owes me fourpence,” explained\nthe boy.",
        "“You must be out of your mind! And how do you know that any\nyoung lady of that name lives here?”",
        "“She owes me twopence for showing her the way there, and\ntwopence for showing her the way back.”",
        "“See what a pack of lies you are telling! The young lady never\ngoes out, cannot even walk; be off and get back to where you\ncame from, before I have to help you along.”",
        "But the boy was not to be frightened away; he remained standing,\nand said in a determined voice, “But I saw her in the street,\nand can describe her to you; she has short, curly black hair, and\nblack eyes, and wears a brown dress, and does not talk quite\nlike we do.”",
        "“Oho!” thought Sebastian, laughing to himself, “the little miss\nhas evidently been up to more mischief.” Then, drawing the boy\ninside he said aloud, “I understand now, come with me and wait\noutside the door till I tell you to go in. Be sure you begin\nplaying your organ the instant you get inside the room; the lady\nis very fond of music.”",
        "Sebastian knocked at the study door, and a voice said, “Come\nin.”",
        "“There is a boy outside who says he must speak to Miss Clara\nherself,” Sebastian announced.",
        "Clara was delighted at such an extraordinary and unexpected\nmessage.",
        "“Let him come in at once,” replied Clara; “he must come in, must\nhe not,” she added, turning to her tutor, “if he wishes so\nparticularly to see me?”",
        "The boy was already inside the room, and according to\nSebastian’s directions immediately began to play his organ.\nFraulein Rottenmeier, wishing to escape the A B C, had retired\nwith her work to the dining-room. All at once she stopped and\nlistened. Did those sounds come up from the street? And yet they\nseemed so near! But how could there be an organ playing in the\nstudy? And yet–it surely was so. She rushed to the other end of\nthe long dining-room and tore open the door. She could hardly\nbelieve her eyes. There, in the middle of the study, stood a\nragged boy turning away at his organ in the most energetic\nmanner. The tutor appeared to be making efforts to speak, but his\nvoice could not be heard. Both children were listening\ndelightedly to the music.",
        "“Leave off! leave off at once!” screamed Fraulein Rottenmeier.\nBut her voice was drowned by the music. She was making a dash\nfor the boy, when she saw something on the ground crawling\ntowards her feet–a dreadful dark object–a tortoise. At this\nsight she jumped higher than she had for many long years before,\nshrieking with all her might, “Sebastian! Sebastian!”",
        "The organ-player suddenly stopped, for this time her voice had\nrisen louder than the music. Sebastian was standing outside bent\ndouble with laughter, for he had been peeping to see what was\ngoing on. By the time he entered the room Fraulein Rottenmeier\nhad sunk into a chair.",
        "“Take them all out, boy and animal! Get them away at once!” she\ncommanded him.",
        "Sebastian pulled the boy away, the latter having quickly caught\nup the tortoise, and when he had got him outside he put\nsomething into his hand. “There is the fourpence from Miss Clara,\nand another fourpence for the music. You did it all quite right!\"\nand with that he shut the front door upon him.",
        "Quietness reigned again in the study, and lessons began once\nmore; Fraulein Rottenmeier now took up her station in the study\nin order by her presence to prevent any further dreadful goings-\non.",
        "But soon another knock came to the door, and Sebastian again\nstepped in, this time to say that some one had brought a large\nbasket with orders that it was to be given at once to Miss\nClara.",
        "“For me?” said Clara in astonishment, her curiosity very much\nexcited, “bring it in at once that I may see what it is like.”",
        "Sebastian carried in a large covered basket and retired.",
        "“I think the lessons had better be finished first before the\nbasket is unpacked,” said Fraulein Rottenmeier.",
        "Clara could not conceive what was in it, and cast longing\nglances towards it. In the middle of one of her declensions she\nsuddenly broke off and said to the tutor, “Mayn’t I just give one\npeep inside to see what is in it before I go on?”",
        "“On some considerations I am for it, on others against it,” he\nbegan in answer; “for it, on the ground that if your whole\nattention is directed to the basket–” but the speech remained\nunfinished. The cover of the basket was loose, and at this\nmoment one, two, three, and then two more, and again more kittens\ncame suddenly tumbling on to the floor and racing about the room\nin every direction, and with such indescribable rapidity that it\nseemed as if the whole room was full of them. They jumped over\nthe tutor’s boots, bit at his trousers, climbed up Fraulein\nRottenmeier’s dress, rolled about her feet, sprang up on to\nClara’s couch, scratching, scrambling, and mewing: it was a sad\nscene of confusion. Clara, meanwhile, pleased with their\ngambols, kept on exclaiming, “Oh, the dear little things! how\npretty they are! Look, Heidi, at this one; look, look, at that\none over there!” And Heidi in her delight kept running after them\nfirst into one corner and then into the other. The tutor stood up\nby the table not knowing what to do, lifting first his right foot\nand then his left to get it away from the scrambling, scratching\nkittens. Fraulein Rottenmeier was unable at first to speak at\nall, so overcome was she with horror, and she did not dare rise\nfrom her chair for fear that all the dreadful little animals\nshould jump upon her at once. At last she found voice to call\nloudly, “Tinette! Tinette! Sebastian! Sebastian!”",
        "They came in answer to her summons and gathered up the kittens,\nby degrees they got them all inside the basket again and then\ncarried them off to put with the other two.",
        "To-day again there had been no opportunity for gaping. Late that\nevening, when Fraulein Rottenmeier had somewhat recovered from\nthe excitement of the morning, she sent for the two servants,\nand examined them closely concerning the events of the morning.\nAnd then it came out that Heidi was at the bottom of them,\neverything being the result of her excursion of the day before.\nFraulein Rottenmeier sat pale with indignation and did not know\nat first how to express her anger. Then she made a sign to\nTinette and Sebastian to withdraw, and turning to Heidi, who was\nstanding by Clara’s couch, quite unable to understand of what sin\nshe had been guilty, began in a severe voice,–",
        "“Adelaide, I know of only one punishment which will perhaps make\nyou alive to your ill conduct, for you are an utter little\nbarbarian, but we will see if we cannot tame you so that you\nshall not be guilty of such deeds again, by putting you in a\ndark cellar with the rats and black beetles.”",
        "Heidi listened in silence and surprise to her sentence, for she\nhad never seen a cellar such as was now described; the place\nknown at her grandfather’s as the cellar, where the fresh made\ncheeses and the new milk were kept, was a pleasant and inviting\nplace; neither did she know at all what rats and black beetles\nwere like.",
        "But now Clara interrupted in great distress. “No, no, Fraulein\nRottenmeier, you must wait till papa comes; he has written to\nsay that he will soon be home, and then I will tell him\neverything, and he will say what is to be done with Heidi.”",
        "Fraulein Rottenmeier could not do anything against this superior\nauthority, especially as the father was really expected very\nshortly. She rose and said with some displeasure, “As you will,\nClara, but I too shall have something to say to Herr Sesemann.\"\nAnd with that she left the room.",
        "Two days now went by without further disturbance. Fraulein\nRottenmeier, however, could not recover her equanimity; she was\nperpetually reminded by Heidi’s presence of the deception that\nhad been played upon her, and it seemed to her that ever since\nthe child had come into the house everything had been topsy-\nturvy, and she could not bring things into proper order again.\nClara had grown much more cheerful; she no longer found time hang\nheavy during the lesson hours, for Heidi was continually making a\ndiversion of some kind or other. She jumbled all her letters up\ntogether and seemed quite unable to learn them, and when the\ntutor tried to draw her attention to their different shapes, and\nto help her by showing her that this was like a little horn, or\nthat like a bird’s bill, she would suddenly exclaim in a joyful\nvoice, “That is a goat!” “That is a bird of prey!” For the\ntutor’s descriptions suggested all kinds of pictures to her mind,\nbut left her still incapable of the alphabet. In the later\nafternoons Heidi always sat with Clara, and then she would give\nthe latter many and long descriptions of the mountain and of her\nlife upon it, and the burning longing to return would become so\noverpowering that she always finished with the words, “Now I must\ngo home! to-morrow I must really go!” But Clara would try to\nquiet her, and tell Heidi that she must wait till her father\nreturned, and then they would see what was to be done. And if\nHeidi gave in each time and seemed quickly to regain her good\nspirits, it was because of a secret delight she had in the\nthought that every day added two more white rolls to the number\nshe was collecting for grandmother; for she always pocketed the\nroll placed beside her plate at dinner and supper, feeling that\nshe could not bear to eat them, knowing that grandmother had no\nwhite bread and could hardly eat the black bread which was so\nhard. After dinner Heidi had to sit alone in her room for a\ncouple of hours, for she understood now that she might not run\nabout outside at Frankfurt as she did on the mountain, and so she\ndid not attempt it. Any conversation with Sebastian in the dining-\nroom was also forbidden her, and as to Tinette, she kept out of\nher way, and never thought of speaking to her, for Heidi was\nquite aware that the maid looked scornfully at her and always\nspoke to her in a mocking voice. So Heidi had plenty of time from\nday to day to sit and picture how everything at home was now\nturning green, and how the yellow flowers were shining in the\nsun, and how all around lay bright in the warm sunshine, the snow\nand the rocks, and the whole wide valley, and Heidi at times\ncould hardly contain herself for the longing to be back home\nagain. And Dete had told her that she could go home whenever she\nliked. So it came about one day that Heidi felt she could not\nbear it any longer, and in haste she tied all the rolls up in her\nred shawl, put on her straw hat, and went downstairs. But just as\nshe reached the hall-door she met Fraulein Rottenmeier herself,\njust returning from a walk, which put a stop to Heidi’s journey.",
        "Fraulein Rottenmeier stood still a moment, looking at her from\ntop to toe in blank astonishment, her eye resting particularly\non the red bundle. Then she broke out,–",
        "“What have you dressed yourself like that for? What do you mean\nby this? Have I not strictly forbidden you to go running about\nin the streets? And here you are ready to start off again, and\ngoing out looking like a beggar.”",
        "“I was not going to run about, I was going home,” said Heidi,\nfrightened.",
        "“What are you talking about! Going home! You want to go home?\"\nexclaimed Fraulein Rottenmeier, her anger rising. “To run away\nlike that! What would Herr Sesemann say if he knew! Take care\nthat he never hears of this! And what is the matter with his\nhouse, I should like to know! Have you not been better treated\nthan you deserved? Have you wanted for a thing? Have you ever in\nyour life before had such a house to live in, such a table, or\nso many to wait upon you? Have you?”",
        "“No,” replied Heidi.",
        "“I should think not indeed!” continued the exasperated lady.\n\"You have everything you can possibly want here, and you are an\nungrateful little thing; it’s because you are too well off and\ncomfortable that you have nothing to do but think what naughty\nthing you can do next!”",
        "Then Heidi’s feelings got the better of her, and she poured\nforth her trouble. “Indeed I only want to go home, for if I stay\nso long away Snowflake will begin crying again, and grandmother\nis waiting for me, and Greenfinch will get beaten, because I am\nnot there to give Peter any cheese, and I can never see how the\nsun says good-night to the mountains; and if the great bird were\nto fly over Frankfurt he would croak louder than ever about\npeople huddling all together and teaching each other bad things,\nand not going to live up on the rocks, where it is so much\nbetter.”",
        "“Heaven have mercy on us, the child is out of her mind!” cried\nFraulein Rottenmeier, and she turned in terror and went quickly\nup the steps, running violently against Sebastian in her hurry.\n\"Go and bring that unhappy little creature in at once,” she\nordered him, putting her hand to her forehead which she had\nbumped against his.",
        "Sebastian did as he was told, rubbing his own head as he went,\nfor he had received a still harder blow.",
        "Heidi had not moved, she stood with her eyes aflame and\ntrembling all over with inward agitation.",
        "“What, got into trouble again?” said Sebastian in a cheerful\nvoice; but when he looked more closely at Heidi and saw that she\ndid not move, he put his hand kindly on her shoulder, and said,\ntrying to comfort her, “There, there, don’t take it to heart so\nmuch; keep up your spirits, that is the great thing! She has\nnearly made a hole in my head, but don’t you let her bully you.\"\nThen seeing that Heidi still did not stir, “We must go; she\nordered me to take you in.”",
        "Heidi now began mounting the stairs, but with a slow, crawling\nstep, very unlike her usual manner. Sebastian felt quite sad as\nhe watched her, and as he followed her up he kept trying to\nencourage her. “Don’t you give in! don’t let her make you\nunhappy! You keep up your courage! Why we’ve got such a sensible\nlittle miss that she has never cried once since she was here;\nmany at that age cry a good dozen times a day. The kittens are\nenjoying themselves very much up in their home; they jump about\nall over the place and behave as if they were little mad things.\nLater we will go up and see them, when Fraulein is out of the\nway, shall we?”",
        "Heidi gave a little nod of assent, but in such a joyless manner\nthat it went to Sebastian’s heart, and he followed her with\nsympathetic eyes as she crept away to her room.",
        "At supper that evening Fraulein Rottenmeier did not speak, but\nshe cast watchful looks towards Heidi as if expecting her at any\nminute to break out in some extraordinary way; but Heidi sat\nwithout moving or eating; all that she did was to hastily hide\nher roll in her pocket.",
        "When the tutor arrived next morning, Fraulein Rottenmeier drew\nhim privately aside, and confided her fear to him that the\nchange of air and the new mode of life and unaccustomed\nsurroundings had turned Heidi’s head; then she told him of the\nincident of the day before, and of Heidi’s strange speech. But\nthe tutor assured her she need not be in alarm; he had already\nbecome aware that the child was somewhat eccentric, but otherwise\nquite right in her mind, and he was sure that, with careful\ntreatment and education, the right balance would be restored, and\nit was this he was striving after. He was the more convinced of\nthis by what he now heard, and by the fact that he had so far\nfailed to teach her the alphabet, Heidi seeming unable to\nunderstand the letters.",
        "Fraulein Rottenmeier was considerably relieved by his words, and\nreleased the tutor to his work. In the course of the afternoon\nthe remembrance of Heidi’s appearance the day before, as she was\nstarting out on her travels, suddenly returned to the lady, and\nshe made up her mind that she would supplement the child’s\nclothing with various garments from Clara’s wardrobe, so as to\ngive her a decent appearance when Herr Sesemann returned. She\nconfided her intention to Clara, who was quite willing to make\nover any number of dresses and hats to Heidi; so the lady went\nupstairs to overhaul the child’s belongings and see what was to\nbe kept and what thrown away. She returned, however, in the\ncourse of a few minutes with an expression of horror upon her\nface.",
        "“What is this, Adelaide, that I find in your wardrobe!” she\nexclaimed. “I never heard of any one doing such a thing before!\nIn a cupboard meant for clothes, Adelaide, what do I see at the\nbottom but a heap of rolls! Will you believe it, Clara, bread in\na wardrobe! a whole pile of bread! Tinette,” she called to that\nyoung woman, who was in the dining-room, “go upstairs and take\naway all those rolls out of Adelaide’s cupboard and the old\nstraw hat on the table.”",
        "“No! no!” screamed Heidi. “I must keep the hat, and the rolls\nare for grandmother,” and she was rushing to stop Tinette when\nFraulein Rottenmeier took hold of her. “You will stop here, and\nall that bread and rubbish shall be taken to the place they\nbelong to,” she said in a determined tone as she kept her hand\non the child to prevent her running forward.",
        "Then Heidi in despair flung herself down on Clara’s couch and\nbroke into a wild fit of weeping, her crying becoming louder and\nmore full of distress, every minute, while she kept on sobbing\nout at intervals, “Now grandmother’s’ bread is all gone! They\nwere all for grandmother, and now they are taken away, and\ngrandmother won’t have one,” and she wept as if her heart would\nbreak. Fraulein Rottenmeier ran out of the room. Clara was\ndistressed and alarmed at the child’s crying. “Heidi, Heidi,\"\nshe said imploringly, “pray do not cry so! listen to me; don’t be\nso unhappy; look now, I promise you that you shall have just as\nmany rolls, or more, all fresh and new to take to grandmother\nwhen you go home; yours would have been hard and stale by then.\nCome, Heidi, do not cry any more!”",
        "Heidi could not get over her sobs for a long time; she would\nnever have been able to leave off crying at all if it had not\nbeen for Clara’s promise, which comforted her. But to make sure\nthat she could depend upon it she kept on saying to Clara, her\nvoice broken with her gradually subsiding sobs, “Will you give\nme as many, quite as many, as I had, for grandmother?” And Clara\nassured her each time that she would give her as many, “or\nmore,” she added, “only be happy again.”",
        "Heidi appeared at supper with her eyes red with weeping, and\nwhen she saw her roll she could not suppress a sob. But she made\nan effort to control herself, for she knew she must sit quietly\nat table. Whenever Sebastian could catch her eye this evening he\nmade all sorts of strange signs, pointing to his own head and\nthen to hers, and giving little nods as much as to say, “Don’t\nyou be unhappy! I have got it all safe for you.”",
        "When Heidi was going to get into bed that night she found her\nold straw hat lying under the counterpane. She snatched it up\nwith delight, made it more out of shape still in her joy, and\nthen, after wrapping a handkerchief round it, she stuck it in a\ncorner of the cupboard as far back as she could.",
        "It was Sebastian who had hidden it there for her; he had been in\nthe dining-room when Tinette was called, and had heard all that\nwent on with the child and the latter’s loud weeping. So he\nfollowed Tinette, and when she came out of Heidi’s room carrying\nthe rolls and the hat, he caught up the hat and said, “I will\nsee to this old thing.” He was genuinely glad to have been able\nto save it for Heidi, and that was the meaning of his encouraging\nsigns to her at supper.",
        "A few days after these events there was great commotion and much\nrunning up and down stairs in Herr Sesemann’s house. The master\nhad just returned, and Sebastian and Tinette were busy carrying\nup one package after another from the carriage, for Herr\nSesemann always brought back a lot of pretty things for his home.\nHe himself had not waited to do anything before going in to see\nhis daughter. Heidi was sitting beside her, for it was late\nafternoon, when the two were always together. Father and\ndaughter greeted each other with warm affection, for they were\ndeeply attached to one another. Then he held out his hand to\nHeidi, who had stolen away into the corner, and said kindly to\nher, “And this is our little Swiss girl; come and shake hands\nwith me! That’s right! Now, tell me, are Clara and you good\nfriends with one another, or do you get angry and quarrel, and\nthen cry and make it up, and then start quarreling again on the\nnext occasion?”",
        "“No, Clara is always kind to me,” answered Heidi.",
        "“And Heidi,” put in Clara quickly, “has not once tried to\nquarrel.”",
        "“That’s all right, I am glad to hear it,” said her father, as he\nrose from his chair. “But you must excuse me, Clara, for I want\nmy dinner; I have had nothing to eat all day. Afterwards I will\nshow you all the things I have brought home with me.”",
        "He found Fraulein Rottenmeier in the dining-room superintending\nthe preparation for his meal, and when he had taken his place\nshe sat down opposite to him, looking the every embodiment of bad\nnews, so that he turned to her and said, “What am I to expect,\nFraulein Rottenmeier? You greet me with an expression of\ncountenance that quite frightens me. What is the matter? Clara\nseems cheerful enough.”",
        "“Herr Sesemann,” began the lady in a solemn voice, “it is a\nmatter which concerns Clara; we have been frightfully imposed\nupon.”",
        "“Indeed, in what way?” asked Herr Sesemann as he went on calmly\ndrinking his wine.",
        "“We had decided, as you remember, to get a companion for Clara,\nand as I knew how anxious you were to have only those who were\nwell-behaved and nicely brought up about her, I thought I would\nlook for a little Swiss girl, as I hoped to find such a one as I\nhave often read about, who, born as it were of the mountain air,\nlives and moves without touching the earth.”",
        "“Still I think even a Swiss child would have to touch the earth\nif she wanted to go anywhere,” remarked Herr Sesemann,\n\"otherwise they would have been given wings instead of feet.”",
        "“Ah, Herr Sesemann, you know what I mean,” continued Fraulein\nRottenmeier. “I mean one so at home among the living creatures\nof the high, pure mountain regions, that she would be like some\nidealistic being from another world among us.”",
        "“And what could Clara do with such an idealistic being as you\ndescribe, Fraulein Rottenmeier.”",
        "“I am not joking, Herr Sesemann, the matter is a more serious\none than you think; I have been shockingly, disgracefully imposed\nupon.”",
        "“But how? what is there shocking and disgraceful? I see nothing\nshocking in the child,” remarked Herr Sesemann quietly.",
        "“If you only knew of one thing she has done, if you only knew of\nthe kind of people and animals she has brought into the house\nduring your absence! The tutor can tell you more about that.”",
        "“Animals? what am I to understand by animals, Fraulein\nRottenmeier?”",
        "“It is past understanding; the whole behavior of the child would\nbe past understanding, if it were not that at times she is\nevidently not in her right mind.”",
        "Herr Sesemann had attached very little importance to what was\ntold him up till now–but not in her right mind! that was more\nserious and might be prejudicial to his own child. Herr Sesemann\nlooked very narrowly at the lady opposite to assure himself that\nthe mental aberration was not on her side. At that moment the\ndoor opened and the tutor was announced.",
        "“Ah! here is some one,” exclaimed Herr Sesemann, “who will help\nto clear up matters for me. Take a seat,” he continued, as he\nheld out his hand to the tutor. “You will drink a cup of coffee\nwith me–no ceremony, I pray! And now tell me, what is the\nmatter with this child that has come to be a companion to my\ndaughter? What is this strange thing I hear about her bringing\nanimals into the house, and is she in her right senses?”",
        "The tutor felt he must begin with expressing his pleasure at\nHerr Sesemann’s return, and with explaining that he had come in\non purpose to give him welcome, but Herr Sesemann begged him to\nexplain without delay the meaning of all he had heard about\nHeidi. The tutor started in his usual style. “If I must give my\nopinion about this little girl, I should like first to state\nthat, if on one side, there is a lack of development which has\nbeen caused by the more or less careless way in which she has\nbeen brought up, or rather, by the neglect of her education,\nwhen young, and by the solitary life she has led on the mountain,\nwhich is not wholly to be condemned; on the contrary, such a\nlife has undoubtedly some advantages in it, if not allowed to\noverstep a certain limit of time–”",
        "“My good friend,” interrupted Herr Sesemann, “you are giving\nyourself more trouble than you need. I only want to know if the\nchild has caused you alarm by any animals she has brought into\nthe house, and what your opinion is altogether as to her being a\nfit companion or not for my daughter?”",
        "“I should not like in any way to prejudice you against her,\"\nbegan the tutor once more; “for if on the one hand there is a\ncertain inexperience of the ways of society, owing to the\nuncivilised life she led up to the time of her removal to\nFrankfurt, on the other hand she is endowed with certain good\nqualities, and, taken on the whole–”",
        "“Excuse me, my dear sir, do not disturb yourself, but I must–I\nthink my daughter will be wanting me,” and with that Herr\nSesemann quickly left the room and took care not to return. He\nsat himself down beside his daughter in the study, and then\nturning to Heidi, who had risen, “Little one, will you fetch\nme,” he began, and then paused, for he could not think what to\nask for, but he wanted to get the child out of the room for a\nlittle while, “fetch me a glass of water.”",
        "“Fresh water?” asked Heidi.",
        "“Yes–Yes–as fresh as you can get it,” he answered. Heidi\ndisappeared on the spot.",
        "“And now, my dear little Clara,” he said, drawing his chair\nnearer and laying her hand in his, “answer my questions clearly\nand intelligibly: what kind of animals has your little companion\nbrought into the house, and why does Fraulein Rottenmeier think\nthat she is not always in her right mind?”",
        "Clara had no difficulty in answering. The alarmed lady had\nspoken to her also about Heidi’s wild manner of talking, but\nClara had not been able to put a meaning to it. She told her\nfather everything about the tortoise and the kittens, and\nexplained to him what Heidi had said the day Fraulein Rottenmeier\nhad been put in such a fright. Herr Sesemann laughed heartily at\nher recital. “So you do not want me to send the child home\nagain,” he asked, “you are not tired of having her here?”",
        "“Oh, no, no,” Clara exclaimed, “please do not send her away.\nTime has passed much more quickly since Heidi was here, for\nsomething fresh happens every day, and it used to be so dull, and\nshe has always so much to tell me.”",
        "“That’s all right then–and here comes your little friend. Have\nyou brought me some nice fresh water?” he asked as Heidi handed\nhim a glass.",
        "“Yes, fresh from the pump,” answered Heidi.",
        "“You did not go yourself to the pump?” said Clara.",
        "“Yes I did; it is quite fresh. I had to go a long way, for there\nwere such a lot of people at the first pump; so I went further\ndown the street, but there were just as many at the second pump,\nbut I was able to get some water at the one in the next street,\nand the gentleman with the white hair asked me to give his kind\nregards to Herr Sesemann.”",
        "“You have had quite a successful expedition,” said Herr Sesemann\nlaughing, “and who was the gentleman?”",
        "“He was passing, and when he saw me he stood still and said, ’As\nyou have a glass will you give me a drink; to whom are you\ntaking the water?’ and when I said, ’To Herr Sesemann,’ he\nlaughed very much, and then he gave me that message for you, and\nalso said he hoped you would enjoy the water.”",
        "“Oh, and who was it, I wonder, who sent me such good wishes–\ntell me what he was like,” said Herr Sesemann.",
        "“He was kind and laughed, and he had a thick gold chain and a\ngold thing hanging from it with a large red stone, and a horse’s\nhead at the top of his stick.”",
        "“It’s the doctor–my old friend the doctor,” exclaimed Clara and\nher father at the same moment, and Herr Sesemann smiled to\nhimself at the thought of what his friend’s opinion must have\nbeen of this new way of satisfying his thirst for water.",
        "That evening when Herr Sesemann and Fraulein Rottenmeier were\nalone, settling the household affairs, he informed her that he\nintended to keep Heidi; he found the child in a perfectly right\nstate of mind, and his daughter liked her as a companion. “I\ndesire, therefore,” he continued, laying stress upon his words,\n\"that the child shall be in every way kindly treated, and that\nher peculiarities shall not be looked upon as crimes. If you\nfind her too much for you alone, I can hold out a prospect of\nhelp, for I am shortly expecting my mother here on a long visit,\nand she, as you know, can get on with anybody, whatever they may\nbe like.”",
        "“O yes, I know,” replied Fraulein Rottenmeier, but there was no\ntone of relief in her voice as she thought of the coming help.",
        "Herr Sesemann was only home for a short time; he left for Paris\nagain before the fortnight was over, comforting Clara, who could\nnot bear that he should go from her again so soon, with the\nprospect of her grandmother’s arrival, which was to take place\nin a few days’ time. Herr Sesemann had indeed only just gone when\na letter came from Frau Sesemann, announcing her arrival on the\nfollowing day, and stating the hour when she might be expected,\nin order that a carriage should be sent to meet her at the\nstation. Clara was overjoyed, and talked so much about her\ngrandmother that evening, that Heidi began also to call her\n\"grandmamma,” which brought down on her a look of displeasure\nfrom Fraulein Rottenmeier; this, however, had no particular\neffect on Heidi, for she was accustomed now to being continually\nin that lady’s black books. But as she was going to her room\nthat night, Fraulein Rottenmeier waylaid her, and drawing her\ninto her own, gave her strict injunctions as to how she was to\naddress Frau Sesemann when she arrived; on no account was she to\ncall her “grandmamma,” but always to say “madam” to her. “Do you\nunderstand?” said the lady, as she saw a perplexed expression on\nHeidi’s face. The latter had not understood, but seeing the\nsevere expression of the lady’s face she did not ask for more\nexplanation.",
        "There was much expectation and preparation about the house on\nthe following evening, and it was easy to see that the lady who\nwas coming was one whose opinion was highly thought of, and for\nwhom everybody had a great respect. Tinette had a new white cap\non her head, and Sebastian collected all the footstools he could\nfind and placed them in convenient spots, so that the lady might\nfind one ready to her feet whenever she chose to sit. Fraulein\nRottenmeier went about surveying everything, very upright and\ndignified, as if to show that though a rival power was expected,\nher own authority was not going to be extinguished.",
        "And now the carriage came driving up to the door, and Tinette\nand Sebastian ran down the steps, followed with a slower and more\nstately step by the lady, who advanced to greet the guest. Heidi\nhad been sent up to her room and ordered to remain there until\ncalled down, as the grandmother would certainly like to see\nClara alone first. Heidi sat herself down in a corner and\nrepeated her instructions over to herself. She had not to wait\nlong before Tinette put her head in and said abruptly, “Go\ndownstairs into the study.”",
        "Heidi had not dared to ask Fraulein Rottenmeier again how she\nwas to address the grandmother: she thought the lady had perhaps\nmade a mistake, for she had never heard any one called by other\nthan their right name. As she opened the study door she heard a\nkind voice say, “Ah, here comes the child! Come along in and let\nme have a good look at you.”",
        "Heidi walked up to her and said very distinctly in her clear\nvoice, “Good-evening,” and then wishing to follow her\ninstructions called her what would be in English “Mrs. Madam.”",
        "“Well!” said the grandmother, laughing, “is that how they\naddress people in your home on the mountain?”",
        "“No,” replied Heidi gravely, “I never knew any one with that\nname before.”",
        "“Nor I either,” laughed the grandmother again as she patted\nHeidi’s cheek. “Never mind! when I am with the children I am\nalways grandmamma; you won’t forget that name, will you?”",
        "“No, no,” Heidi assured her, “I often used to say it at home.”",
        "“I understand,” said the grandmother, with a cheerful little nod\nof the head. Then she looked more closely at Heidi, giving\nanother nod from time to time, and the child looked back at her\nwith steady, serious eyes, for there was something kind and warm-\nhearted about this new-comer that pleased Heidi, and indeed\neverything to do with the grandmother attracted her, so that she\ncould not turn her eyes away. She had such beautiful white hair,\nand two long lace ends hung down from the cap on her head and\nwaved gently about her face every time she moved, as if a soft\nbreeze were blowing round her, which gave Heidi a peculiar\nfeeling of pleasure.",
        "“And what is your name, child?” the grandmother now asked.",
        "“I am always called Heidi; but as I am now to be called\nAdelaide, I will try and take care–” Heidi stopped short, for\nshe felt a little guilty; she had not yet grown accustomed to\nthis name; she continued not to respond when Fraulein Rottenmeier\nsuddenly addressed her by it, and the lady was at this moment\nentering the room.",
        "“Frau Sesemann will no doubt agree with me,” she interrupted,\n\"that it was necessary to choose a name that could be pronounced\neasily, if only for the sake of the servants.”",
        "“My worthy Rottenmeier,” replied Frau Sesemann, “if a person is\ncalled ’Heidi’ and has grown accustomed to that name, I call her\nby the same, and so let it be.”",
        "Fraulein Rottenmeier was always very much annoyed that the old\nlady continually addressed her by her surname only; but it was\nno use minding, for the grandmother always went her own way, and\nso there was no help for it. Moreover the grandmother was a keen\nold lady, and had all her five wits about her, and she knew what\nwas going on in the house as soon as she entered it.",
        "When on the following day Clara lay down as usual on her couch\nafter dinner, the grandmother sat down beside her for a few\nminutes and closed her eyes, then she got up again as lively as\never, and trotted off into the dining-room. No one was there.\n\"She is asleep, I suppose,” she said to herself, and then going\nup to Fraulein Rottenmeier’s room she gave a loud knock at the\ndoor. She waited a few minutes and then Fraulein Rottenmeier\nopened the door and drew back in surprise at this unexpected\nvisit.",
        "“Where is the child, and what is she doing all this time? That\nis what I came to ask,” said Frau Sesemann.",
        "“She is sitting in her room, where she could well employ herself\nif she had the least idea of making herself useful; but you have\nno idea, Frau Sesemann, of the out-of-the-way things this child\nimagines and does, things which I could hardly repeat in good\nsociety.”",
        "“I should do the same if I had to sit in there like that child,\nI can tell you; I doubt if you would then like to repeat what I\ndid, in good society! Go and fetch the child and bring her to my\nroom; I have some pretty books with me that I should like to\ngive her.”",
        "“That is just the misfortune,” said Fraulein Rottenmeier with a\ndespairing gesture, “what use are books to her? She has not been\nable to learn her A B C even, all the long time she has been\nhere; it is quite impossible to get the least idea of it into\nher head, and that the tutor himself will tell you; if he had not\nthe patience of an angel he would have given up teaching her long\nago.”",
        "“That is very strange,” said Frau Sesemann, “she does not look\nto me like a child who would be unable to learn her alphabet.\nHowever, bring her now to me, she can at least amuse herself\nwith the pictures in the books.”",
        "Fraulein Rottenmeier was prepared with some further remarks, but\nthe grandmother had turned away and gone quickly towards her own\nroom. She was surprised at what she had been told about Heidi’s\nincapacity for learning, and determined to find out more\nconcerning this matter, not by inquiries from the tutor,\nhowever, although she esteemed him highly for his uprightness of\ncharacter; she had always a friendly greeting for him, but\nalways avoided being drawn into conversation with him, for she\nfound his style of talk somewhat wearisome.",
        "Heidi now appeared and gazed with open-eyed delight and wonder\nat the beautiful colored pictures in the books which the\ngrandmother gave her to look at. All of a sudden, as the latter\nturned over one of the pages to a fresh picture, the child gave a\ncry. For a moment or two she looked at it with brightening eyes,\nthen the tears began to fall, and at last she burst into sobs.\nThe grandmother looked at the picture–it represented a green\npasture, full of young animals, some grazing and others nibbling\nat the shrubs. In the middle was a shepherd leaning upon his\nstaff and looking on at his happy flock. The whole scene was\nbathed in golden light, for the sun was just sinking below the\nhorizon.",
        "The grandmother laid her hand kindly On Heidi’s.",
        "“Don’t cry, dear child, don’t cry,” she said, “the picture has\nreminded you perhaps of something. But see, there is a beautiful\ntale to the picture which I will tell you this evening. And\nthere are other nice tales of all kinds to read and to tell\nagain. But now we must have a little talk together, so dry your\ntears and come and stand in front of me, so that I may see you\nwell–there, now we are happy again.”",
        "But it was some little time before Heidi could overcome her\nsobs. The grandmother gave her time to recover herself, saying\ncheering words to her now and then, “There, it’s all right now,\nand we are quite happy again.”",
        "When at last she saw that Heidi was growing calmer, she said,\n\"Now I want you to tell me something. How are you getting on in\nyour school-time; do you like your lessons, and have you learnt\na great deal?”",
        "“O no!” replied Heidi, sighing, “but I knew beforehand that it\nwas not possible to learn.”",
        "“What is it you think impossible to learn?”",
        "“Why, to read, it is too difficult.”",
        "“You don’t say so! and who told you that?”",
        "“Peter told me, and he knew all about it, for he had tried and\ntried and could not learn it.”",
        "“Peter must be a very odd boy then! But listen, Heidi, we must\nnot always go by what Peter says, we must try for ourselves. I\nam certain that you did not give all your attention to the tutor\nwhen he was trying to teach you your letters.”",
        "“It’s of no use,” said Heidi in the tone of one who was ready to\nendure what could not be cured.",
        "“Listen to what I have to say,” continued the grandmother. “You\nhave not been able to learn your alphabet because you believed\nwhat Peter said; but now you must believe what I tell you–and I\ntell you that you can learn to read in a very little while, as\nmany other children do, who are made like you and not like\nPeter. And now hear what comes after–you see that picture with\nthe shepherd and the animals–well, as soon as you are able to\nread you shall have that book for your own, and then you will\nknow all about the sheep and the goats, and what the shepherd\ndid, and the wonderful things that happened to him, just as if\nsome one were telling you the whole tale. You will like to hear\nabout all that, won’t you?”",
        "Heidi had listened with eager attention to the grandmother’s\nwords and now with a sigh exclaimed, “Oh, if only I could read\nnow!”",
        "“It won’t take you long now to learn, that I can see; and now we\nmust go down to Clara; bring the books with you.” And hand in\nhand the two returned to the study.",
        "Since the day when Heidi had so longed to go home, and Fraulein\nRottenmeier had met her and scolded her on the steps, and told\nher how wicked and ungrateful she was to try and run away, and\nwhat a good thing it was that Herr Sesemann knew nothing about\nit, a change had come over the child. She had at last understood\nthat day that she could not go home when she wished as Dete had\ntold her, but that she would have to stay on in Frankfurt for a\nlong, long time, perhaps for ever. She had also understood that\nHerr Sesemann would think it ungrateful of her if she wished to\nleave, and she believed that the grandmother and Clara would\nthink the same. So there was nobody to whom she dared confide\nher longing to go home, for she would not for the world have\ngiven the grandmother, who was so kind to her, any reason for\nbeing as angry with her as Fraulein Rottenmeier had been. But the\nweight of trouble on the little heart grew heavier and heavier;\nshe could no longer eat her food, and every day she grew a little\npaler. She lay awake for long hours at night, for as soon as she\nwas alone and everything was still around her, the picture of\nthe mountain with its sunshine and flowers rose vividly before\nher eyes; and when at last she fell asleep it was to dream of the\nrocks and the snow-field turning crimson in the evening light,\nand waking in the morning she would think herself back at the\nhut and prepare to run joyfully out into–the sun–and then–\nthere was her large bed, and here she was in Frankfurt far, far\naway from home. And Heidi would often lay her face down on the\npillow and weep long and quietly so that no one might hear her.",
        "Heidi’s unhappiness did not escape the grandmother’s notice. She\nlet some days go by to see if the child grew brighter and lost\nher down-cast appearance. But as matters did not mend, and she\nsaw that many mornings Heidi had evidently been crying before\nshe came downstairs, she took her again into her room one day,\nand drawing the child to her said, “Now tell me, Heidi, what is\nthe matter; are you in trouble?”",
        "But Heidi, afraid if she told the truth that the grandmother\nwould think her ungrateful, and would then leave off being so\nkind to her, answered, “can’t tell you.”",
        "“Well, could you tell Clara about it?”",
        "“Oh, no, I cannot tell any one,” said Heidi in so positive a\ntone, and with a look of such trouble on her face, that the\ngrandmother felt full of pity for the child.",
        "“Then, dear child, let me tell you what to do: you know that\nwhen we are in great trouble, and cannot speak about it to\nanybody, we must turn to God and pray Him to help, for He can\ndeliver us from every care, that oppresses us. You understand\nthat, do you not? You say your prayers every evening to the dear\nGod in Heaven, and thank Him for all He has done for you, and\npray Him to keep you from all evil, do you not?”",
        "“No, I never say any prayers,” answered Heidi.",
        "“Have you never been taught to pray, Heidi; do you not know even\nwhat it means?”",
        "“I used to say prayers with the first grandmother, but that is a\nlong time ago, and I have forgotten them.”",
        "“That is the reason, Heidi, that you are so unhappy, because you\nknow no one who can help you. Think what a comfort it is when\nthe heart is heavy with grief to be able at any moment to go and\ntell everything to God, and pray Him for the help that no one\nelse can give us. And He can help us and give us everything that\nwill make us happy again.”",
        "A sudden gleam of joy came into Heidi’s eyes. “May I tell Him\neverything, everything?”",
        "“Yes, everything, Heidi, everything.”",
        "Heidi drew her hand away, which the grandmother was holding\naffectionately between her own, and said quickly, “May I go?”",
        "“Yes, of course,” was the answer, and Heidi ran out of the room\ninto her own, and sitting herself on a stool, folded her hands\ntogether and told God about everything that was making her so\nsad and unhappy, and begged Him earnestly to help her and to let\nher go home to her grandfather.",
        "It was about a week after this that the tutor asked Frau\nSesemann’s permission for an interview with her, as he wished to\ninform her of a remarkable thing that had come to pass. So she\ninvited him to her room, and as he entered she held out her hand\nin greeting, and pushing a chair towards him, “I am pleased to\nsee you,” she said, “pray sit down and tell me what brings you\nhere; nothing bad, no complaints, I hope?”",
        "“Quite the reverse,” began the tutor. “Something has happened\nthat I had given up hoping for, and which no one, knowing what\nhas gone before, could have guessed, for, according to all\nexpectations, that which has taken place could only be looked\nupon as a miracle, and yet it really has come to pass and in the\nmost extraordinary manner, quite contrary to all that one could\nanticipate–”",
        "“Has the child Heidi really learnt to read at last?” put in Frau\nSesemann.",
        "The tutor looked at the lady in speechless astonishment. At last\nhe spoke again. “It is indeed truly marvellous, not only because\nshe never seemed able to learn her A B C even after all my full\nexplanations, and after spending unusual pains upon her, but\nbecause now she has learnt it so rapidly, just after I had made\nup my mind to make no further attempts at the impossible but to\nput the letters as they were before her without any dissertation\non their origin and meaning, and now she has as you might say\nlearnt her letters over night, and started at once to read\ncorrectly, quite unlike most beginners. And it is almost as\nastonishing to me that you should have guessed such an unlikely\nthing.”",
        "“Many unlikely things happen in life,” said Frau Sesemann with a\npleased smile. “Two things coming together may produce a happy\nresult, as for instance, a fresh zeal for learning and a new\nmethod of teaching, and neither does any harm. We can but\nrejoice that the child has made such a good start and hope for\nher future progress.”",
        "After parting with the tutor she went down to the study to make\nsure of the good news. There sure enough was Heidi, sitting\nbeside Clara and reading aloud to her, evidently herself very\nmuch surprised, and growing more and more delighted with the new\nworld that was now open to her as the black letters grew alive\nand turned into men and things and exciting stories. That same\nevening Heidi found the large book with the beautiful pictures\nlying on her plate when she took her place at table, and when\nshe looked questioningly at the grandmother, the latter nodded\nkindly to her and said, “Yes, it’s yours now.”",
        "“Mine, to keep always? even when I go home?” said, Heidi,\nblushing with pleasure.",
        "“Yes, of course, yours for ever,” the grandmother assured her.\n\"To-morrow we will begin to read it.”",
        "“But you are not going home yet, Heidi, not for years,” put in\nClara. “When grandmother goes away, I shall want you to stay on\nwith me.”",
        "When, Heidi went to her room that night she had another look at\nher book before going to bed, and from that day forth her chief\npleasure was to read the tales which belonged to the beautiful\npictures over and over again. If the grandmother said, as they\nwere sitting together in the evening, “Now Heidi will read aloud\nto us,” Heidi was delighted, for reading was no trouble to her\nnow, and when she read the tales aloud the scenes seemed to grow\nmore beautiful and distinct, and then grandmother would explain\nand tell her more about them still.",
        "Still the picture she liked best was the one of the shepherd\nleaning on his staff with his flock around him in the midst of\nthe green pasture,  for he was now at home and happy, following\nhis father’s sheep and goats. Then came the picture where he was\nseen far away from his father’s house, obliged to look after the\nswine, and he had grown pale and thin from the husks which were\nall he had to eat. Even the sun seemed here to be less bright\nand everything looked grey and misty. But there was the third\npicture still to this tale: here was the old father with\noutstretched arms running to meet and embrace his returning and\nrepentant son, who was advancing timidly, worn out and emaciated\nand clad in a ragged coat. That was Heidi’s favorite tale, which\nshe read over and over again, aloud and to herself, and she was\nnever tired of hearing the grandmother explain it to her and\nClara. But there were other tales in the book besides, and what\nwith reading and looking at the pictures the days passed quickly\naway, and the time drew near for the grandmother to return home.",
        "Every afternoon during her visit the grandmother went and sat\ndown for a few minutes beside Clara after dinner, when the\nlatter was resting, and Fraulein Rottenmeier, probably for the\nsame reason, had disappeared inside her room; but five minutes\nsufficed her, and then she was up again, and Heidi was sent for\nto her room, and there she would talk to the child and employ\nand amuse her in all sorts of ways. The grandmother had a lot of\npretty dolls, and she showed Heidi how to make dresses and\npinafores for them, so that Heidi learnt how to sew and to make\nall sorts of beautiful clothes for the little people out of a\nwonderful collection of pieces that grandmother had by her of\nevery describable and lovely color. And then grandmother liked\nto hear her read aloud, and the oftener Heidi read her tales the\nfonder she grew of them. She entered into the lives of all the\npeople she read about so that they became like dear friends to\nher, and it delighted her more and more to be with them. But\nstill Heidi never looked really happy, and her bright eyes were\nno longer to be seen. It was the last week of the grandmother’s\nvisit. She called Heidi into her room as usual one day after\ndinner, and the child came with her book under her arm. The\ngrandmother called her to come close, and then laying the book\naside, said, “Now, child, tell me why you are not happy? Have\nyou still the same trouble at heart?”",
        "Heidi nodded in reply.",
        "“Have you told God about it?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“And do you pray every day that He will make things right and\nthat you may be happy again?”",
        "“No, I have left off praying.”",
        "“Do not tell me that, Heidi! Why have you left off praying?”",
        "“It is of no use, God does not listen,” Heidi went on in an\nagitated voice, “and I can understand that when there are so\nmany, many people in Frankfurt praying to Him every evening that\nHe cannot attend to them all, and He certainly has not heard\nwhat I said to Him.”",
        "“And why are you so sure of that, Heidi?”",
        "“Because I have prayed for the same thing every day for weeks,\nand yet God has not done what I asked.”",
        "“You are wrong, Heidi; you must not think of Him like that. God\nis a good father to us all, and knows better than we do what is\ngood for us. If we ask Him for something that is not good for\nus, He does not give it, but something better still, if only we\nwill continue to pray earnestly and do not run away and lose our\ntrust in Him. God did not think what you have been praying for\nwas good for you just now; but be sure He heard you, for He can\nhear and see every one at the same time, because He is a God and\nnot a human being like you and me. And because He thought it was\nbetter for you not to have at once what you wanted, He said to\nHimself: Yes, Heidi shall have what she asks for, but not until\nthe right time comes, so that she may be quite happy. If I do\nwhat she wants now, and then one day she sees that it would have\nbeen better for her not to have had her own way, she will cry and\nsay, ’If only God had not given me what I asked for! it is not so\ngood as I expected!’ And while God is watching over you, and\nlooking to see if you will trust Him and go on praying to Him\nevery day, and turn to Him for everything you want, you run away\nand leave off saying your prayers, and forget all about Him. And\nwhen God no longer hears the voice of one He knew among those who\npray to Him, He lets that person go his own way, that he may\nlearn how foolish he is. And then this one gets into trouble, and\ncries, ’Save me, God, for there is none other to help me,’ and\nGod says, ’Why did you go from Me; I could not help you when you\nran away.’ And you would not like to grieve God, would you Heidi,\nwhen He only wants to be kind to you? So will you not go and ask\nHim to forgive you, and continue to pray and to trust Him, for\nyou may be sure that He will make everything right and happy for\nyou, and then you will be glad and lighthearted again.”",
        "Heidi had perfect confidence in the grandmother, and every word\nshe said sunk into her heart.",
        "“I will go at once and ask God to forgive me, and I will never\nforget Him again,” she replied repentantly.",
        "“That is right, dear child,” and anxious to cheer her, added,\n\"Don’t be unhappy, for He will do everything you wish in good\ntime.”",
        "And Heidi ran away and prayed that she might always remember\nGod, and that He would go on thinking about her.",
        "The day came for grandmother’s departure–a sad one for Clara\nand Heidi. But the grandmother was determined to make it as much\nlike a holiday as possible and not to let them mope, and she kept\nthem so lively and amused that they had no time to think about\ntheir sorrow at her going until she really drove away. Then the\nhouse seemed so silent and empty that Heidi and Clara did not\nknow what to do with themselves, and sat during the remainder of\nthe day like two lost children.",
        "The next day, when the hour came for Clara and Heidi to be\ntogether, the latter walked in with her book and proposed that\nshe should go on reading aloud every afternoon to Clara, if the\nlatter liked it. Clara agreed, and thought anyhow it would be\nnice for that day, so Heidi began with her usual enthusiasm. But\nthe reading did not last long, for Heidi had hardly begun a tale\nabout a dying grandmother before she cried out, “O! then\ngrandmother is dead!” and burst into tears; for everything she\nread was so real to her that she quite thought it was the\ngrandmother at home who had died, and she kept on exclaiming as\nher sobs increased, “She is dead, and I shall never see her\nagain, and she never had one of the white rolls!”",
        "Clara did all she could to explain to Heidi that the story was\nabout quite a different grandmother; but even when at last she\nhad been able to convince Heidi of this, the latter continued to\nweep inconsolably, for now she had awakened to the thought that\nperhaps the grandmother, and even the grandfather also, might\ndie while she was so far away, and that if she did not go home\nfor a long time she would find everything there all silent and\ndead, and there she would be all alone, and would never be able\nto see the dear ones she loved any more.",
        "Fraulein Rottenmeier had meanwhile come into the room, and Clara\nexplained to her what had happened. As Heidi continued her\nweeping, the lady, who was evidently getting impatient with her,\nwent up to Heidi and said with decision, “Now, Adelaide, that is\nenough of all this causeless lamentation. I will tell you once\nfor all, if there are any more scenes like this while you are\nreading, I shall take the book away from you and shall not let\nyou have it again.”",
        "Her words had immediate effect on Heidi, who turned pale with\nfear. The book was her one great treasure. She quickly dried her\ntears and swallowed her sobs as best she could, so that no\nfurther sound of them should be heard. The threat did its work,\nfor Heidi never cried aloud again whatever she might be reading,\nbut she had often to struggle hard to keep back her tears, so\nthat Clara would look at her and say,",
        "“What faces you are making, Heidi, I never saw anything like\nit!” But the faces made no noise and did not offend Fraulein\nRottenmeier, and Heidi, having overcome her fit of despairing\nmisery, would go quietly on for a while, and no one perceived\nher sorrow. But she lost all her appetite, and looked so pale and\nthin that Sebastian was quite unhappy when he looked at her, and\ncould not bear to see her refusing all the nice dishes he handed\nher. He would whisper to her sometimes, in quite a kind,\nfatherly manner, “Take a little; you don’t know how nice it is!\nThere, a good spoonful, now another.” But it was of no use, Heidi\nhardly ate anything at all, and as soon as she laid her head down\nat night the picture of home would rise before her eyes, and she\nwould weep, burying her face in the pillow that her crying might\nnot be heard.",
        "And so many weeks passed away. Heidi did not know it is was\nwinter or summer, for the walls and windows she looked out upon\nshowed no change, and she never went beyond the house except on\nrare occasions when Clara was well enough to drive out, and then\nthey only went a very little way, as Clara could not bear the\nmovement for long. So that on these occasions they generally\nonly saw more fine streets and large houses and crowds of people;\nthey seldom got anywhere beyond them, and grass and flowers, fir\ntrees and mountains, were still far away. Heidi’s longing for the\nold familiar and beautiful things grew daily stronger, so that\nnow only to read a word that recalled them to her remembrance\nbrought her to the verge of tears, which with difficulty she\nsuppressed. So the autumn and winter passed, and again the sun\ncame shining down on the white walls of the opposite houses, and\nHeidi would think to herself that now the time had come for Peter\nto go out again with the goats, to where the golden flowers of\nthe cistus were glowing in the sunlight, and all the rocks around\nturned to fire at sunset. Heidi would go and sit in a corner of\nher lonely room and put her hands up to her eyes that she might\nnot see the sun shining on the opposite wall; and then she would\nremain without moving, battling silently with her terrible\nhomesickness until Clara sent for her again.",
        "For some days past Fraulein Rottenmeier had gone about rather\nsilently and as if lost in thought. As twilight fell, and she\npassed from room to room, or along the long corridors, she was\nseen to look cautiously behind her, and into the dark corners,\nas if she thought some one was coming silently behind her and\nmight unexpectedly give her dress a pull. Nor would she now go\nalone into some parts of the house. If she visited the upper\nfloor where the grand guest-chambers were, or had to go down into\nthe large mysterious council-chamber, where every footstep\nechoed, and the old senators with their big white collars looked\ndown so solemnly and immovably from their frames, she regularly\ncalled Tinette to accompany her, in case, as she said, there\nmight be something to carry up or down. Tinette on her side did\nexactly the same; if she had business upstairs or down, she\ncalled Sebastian to accompany her, and there was always something\nhe must help her with which she could not carry alone. More\ncurious still, Sebastian, also, if sent into one of the more\ndistant rooms, always called John to go with him in case he\nshould want his assistance in bringing what was required. And\nJohn readily obeyed, although there was never anything to carry,\nand either might well have gone alone; but he did not know how\nsoon he might want to ask Sebastian to do the same service for\nhim. And while these things were going on upstairs, the cook, who\nhad been in the house for years, would stand shaking her head\nover her pots and kettles, and sighing, “That ever I should live\nto know such a thing.”",
        "For something very strange and mysterious was going on in Herr\nSesemann’s house. Every morning, when the servants went\ndownstairs, they found the front door wide open, although nobody\ncould be seen far or near to account for it. During the first\nfew days that this happened every room and corner was searched in\ngreat alarm, to see if anything had been stolen, for the general\nidea was that a thief had been hiding in the house and had gone\noff in the night with the stolen goods; but not a thing in the\nhouse had been touched, everything was safe in its place. The\ndoor was doubly locked at night, and for further security the\nwooden bar was fastened across it; but it was no good–next\nmorning the door again stood open. The servants in their fear\nand excitement got up extra early, but not so early but what the\ndoor had been opened before they got downstairs, although\neverything and everybody around were still wrapped in slumber,\nand the doors and windows of the adjoining houses all fast shut.\nAt last, after a great deal of persuasion from Fraulein\nRottenmeier, Sebastian and John plucked up courage and agreed to\nsit up one night in the room next to the large council-chamber\nand to watch and see what would happen. Fraulein Rottenmeier\nlooked up several weapons belonging to the master, and gave these\nand a bottle of spirits to Sebastian, so that their courage might\nnot faint if it came to a fight.",
        "On the appointed night the two sat down and began at once to\ntake some of the strengthening cordial, which at first made them\nvery talkative and then very sleepy, so that they leant back in\ntheir seats and became silent. As midnight struck, Sebastian\nroused himself and called to his companion, who, however, was not\neasy to wake, and kept rolling his head first to one side and\nthen the other and continuing to sleep. Sebastian began to listen\nmore attentively, for he was wide awake now. Everything was still\nas a mouse, all sound had died away from the streets even. He did\nnot feel inclined to go to sleep again, for the stillness was\nghostly to him, and he was afraid now to raise his voice to rouse\nJohn, so he shook him gently to make him stir. At last, as one\nstruck, John work up, and came back to the consciousness of why\nhe was sitting in a chair instead of lying in his bed. He now got\nup with a great show of courage and said, “Come, Sebastian, we\nmust go outside and see what is going on; you need not be afraid,\njust follow me.”",
        "Whereupon he opened the door wide and stepped into the hall.\nJust as he did so a sudden gust of air blew through the open\nfront door and put out the light which John held in his hand. He\nstarted back, almost overturning Sebastian, whom he clutched and\npulled back into the room, and then shutting the door quickly he\nturned the key as far as he could make it go. Then he pulled out\nhis matches and lighted his candle again. Sebastian, in the\nsuddenness of the affair, did not know exactly what had\nhappened, for he had not seen the open door or felt the breeze\nbehind John’s broad figure. But now, as he saw the latter in the\nlight, he gave a cry of alarm, for John was trembling all over\nand as white as a ghost. “What’s the matter? What did you see,\noutside?” asked Sebastian sympathetically.",
        "“The door partly open,” gasped John, “and a white figure\nstanding at the top of the steps–there it stood, and then all in\na minute it disappeared.”",
        "Sebastian felt his blood run cold. The two sat down close to one\nanother and did not dare move again till the morning broke and\nthe streets began to be alive again. Then they left the room\ntogether, shut the front door, and went upstairs to tell\nFraulein Rottenmeier of their experience. She was quite ready to\nreceive them, for she had not been able to sleep at all in the\nanxiety of waiting to hear their report. They had no sooner given\nher details of the night’s experience than she sat down and wrote\nstraight off to Herr Sesemann, who had never received such a\nletter before in his life. She could hardly write, she told him,\nfor her fingers were stiff with fear, and Herr Sesemann must\nplease arrange to come back at once, for dreadful and\nunaccountable things were taking place at home. Then she entered\ninto particulars of all that had happened, of how the door was\nfound standing open every morning, and how nobody in the house\nnow felt sure of their life in this unprotected state of things,\nand how it was impossible to tell what terrible results might\nfollow on these mysterious doings.",
        "Herr Sesemann answered that it was quite impossible for him to\narrange to leave his business and return home at once. He was\nvery much astonished at this ghost tale, but hoped by this time\nthe ghost had disappeared. If, however, it still continued to\ndisturb the household, would Fraulein Rottenmeier write to the\ngrandmother and ask her if she could come and do something; she,\nhe was sure, would soon find out a way to deal with the ghost so\nthat it would not venture again to haunt his house. Fraulein\nRottenmeier was not pleased with the tone of this letter; she\ndid not think the matter was treated seriously enough. She wrote\noff without delay to Frau Sesemann, but got no more satisfactory\nreply from that quarter, and some remarks in the letter she\nconsidered were quite offensive. Frau Sesemann wrote that she\ndid not feel inclined to take the journey again from Holstein to\nFrankfurt because Rottenmeier fancied she saw ghosts. There had\nnever been a ghost in the house since she had known it, and if\nthere was one now it must be a live one, with which Rottenmeier\nought to be able to deal; if not she had better send for the\nwatchman to help her.",
        "Fraulein Rottenmeier, however, was determined not to pass any\nmore days in a state of fear, and she knew the right course to\npursue. She had as yet said nothing to the children of the\nghostly apparitions, for she knew if she did that the children\nwould not remain alone for a single moment, and that might\nentail discomfort for herself. But now she walked straight off\ninto the study, and there in a low mysterious voice told the two\nchildren everything that had taken place. Clara immediately\nscreamed out that she could not remain another minute alone, her\nfather must come home, and Fraulein Rottenmeier must sleep in her\nroom at night, and Heidi too must not be left by herself, for the\nghost might do something to her. She insisted that they should\nall sleep together in one room and keep a light burning all\nnight, and Tinette had better be in the next room, and Sebastian\nand John come upstairs and spend the night in the hall, so that\nthey might call out and frighten the ghost the instant they saw\nit appear on the steps. Clara, in short, grew very excited, and\nFraulein Rottenmeier had great difficulty in quieting her. She\npromised to write at once to her father, and to have her bed put\nin her room and not to be left alone for a moment. They could\nnot all sleep in the same room, but if Heidi was frightened, why\nTinette must go into her room. But Heidi was far more frightened\nof Tinette than of ghosts, of which the child had never before\nheard, so she assured the others she did not mind the ghost, and\nwould rather be alone at night.",
        "Fraulein Rottenmeier now sat down to write another letter to\nHerr Sesemann, stating that these unaccountable things that were\ngoing on in the house had so affected his daughter’s delicate\nconstitution that the worst consequences might be expected.\nEpileptic fits and St. Vitus’s dance often came on suddenly in\ncases like this, and Clara was liable to be attacked by either\nif the cause of the general alarm was not removed.",
        "The letter was successful, and two days later Herr Sesemann\nstood at his front door and rang the bell in such a manner that\neverybody came rushing from all parts of the house and stood\nlooking affrighted at everybody else, convinced that the ghost\nwas impudently beginning its evil tricks in daylight. Sebastian\npeeped cautiously through a half-closed shutter; as he did so\nthere came another violent ring at the bell, which it was\nimpossible to mistake for anything but a very hard pull from a\nnon-ghostly hand. And Sebastian recognised whose hand it was,\nand rushing pell-mell out of the room, fell heels over head\ndownstairs, but picked himself up at the bottom and flung open\nthe street door. Herr Sesemann greeted him abruptly and went up\nwithout a moment’s delay into his daughter’s room. Clara greeted\nhim with a cry of joy, and seeing her so lively and apparently\nas well as ever, his face cleared, and the frown of anxiety\npassed gradually away from it as he heard from his daughter’s own\nlips that she had nothing the matter with her, and moreover was\nso delighted to see him that she was quite glad about the ghost,\nas it was the cause of bringing him home again.",
        "“And how is the ghost getting on?” he asked, turning to Fraulein\nRottenmeier, with a twinkle of amusement in his eye.",
        "“It is no joke, I assure you,” replied that lady. “You will not\nlaugh yourself to-morrow morning, Herr Sesemann; what is going\non in the house points to some terrible thing that has taken\nplace in the past and been concealed.”",
        "“Well, I know nothing about that,” said the master of the house,\n\"but I must beg you not to bring suspicion on my worthy\nancestors. And now will you kindly call Sebastian into the dining-\nroom, as I wish to speak to him alone.”",
        "Herr Sesemann had been quite aware that Sebastian and Fraulein\nRottenmeier were not on the best of terms, and he had his ideas\nabout this scare.",
        "“Come here, lad,” he said as Sebastian appeared, “and tell me\nfrankly–have you been playing at ghosts to amuse yourself at\nFraulein Rottenmeier’s expense?”",
        "“No, on my honor, sir; pray, do not think it; I am very\nuncomfortable about the matter myself,” answered Sebastian with\nunmistakable truthfulness.",
        "“Well, if that is so, I will show you and John to-morrow morning\nhow ghosts look in the daylight. You ought to be ashamed of\nyourself, Sebastian, a great strong lad like you, to run away\nfrom a ghost! But now go and take a message to my old friend the\ndoctor; give him my kind regards, and ask him if he will come to\nme to-night at nine o’clock without fail; I have come by express\nfrom Paris to consult him. I shall want him to spend the night\nhere, so bad a case is it; so he will arrange accordingly. You\nunderstand?”",
        "“Yes, sir,” replied Sebastian, “I will see to the matter as you\nwish.” Then Herr Sesemann returned to Clara, and begged her to\nhave no more fear, as he would soon find out all about the ghost\nand put an end to it.",
        "Punctually at nine o’clock, after the children had gone to bed\nand Fraulein Rottenmeier had retired, the doctor arrived. He was\na grey-haired man with a fresh face, and two bright, kindly\neyes. He looked anxious as he walked in, but, on catching sight\nof his patient, burst out laughing and clapped him on the\nshoulder. “Well,” he said, “you look pretty bad for a person that\nI am to sit up with all night.”",
        "“Patience, friend,” answered Herr Sesemann, “the one you have to\nsit up for will look a good deal worse when we have once caught\nhim.”",
        "“So there is a sick person in the house, and one that has first\nto be caught?”",
        "“Much worse than that, doctor! a ghost in the house! My house is\nhaunted!”",
        "The doctor laughed aloud.",
        "“That’s a nice way of showing sympathy, doctor!” continued Herr,\nSesemann. “It’s a pity my friend Rottenmeier cannot hear you.\nShe is firmly convinced that some old member of the family is\nwandering about the house doing penance for some awful crime he\ncommitted.”",
        "“How did she become acquainted with him?” asked the doctor,\nstill very much amused.",
        "So Herr Sesemann recounted to him how the front door was nightly\nopened by somebody, according to the testimony of the combined\nhousehold, and he had therefore provided two loaded revolvers,\nso as to be prepared for anything that happened; for either the\nwhole thing was a joke got up by some friend of the servants,\njust to alarm the household while he was away–and in that case\na pistol fired into the air would procure him a wholesome fright–\nor else it was a thief, who, by leading everybody at first to\nthink there was a ghost, made it safe for himself when he came\nlater to steal, as no one would venture to run out if they heard\nhim, and in that case too a good weapon would not be amiss.",
        "The two took up their quarters for the night in the same room in\nwhich Sebastian and John had kept watch. A bottle of wine was\nplaced on the table, for a little refreshment would be welcome\nfrom time to time if the night was to be passed sitting up.\nBeside it lay the two revolvers, and two good-sized candles had\nalso been lighted, for Herr Sesemann was determined not to wait\nfor ghosts in any half light.",
        "The door was shut close to prevent the light being seen in the\nhall outside, which might frighten away the ghost. And now the\ntwo gentlemen sat comfortably back in the arm-chairs and began\ntalking of all sorts of things, now and then pausing to take a\ngood draught of wine, and so twelve o’clock struck before they\nwere aware.",
        "“The ghost has got scent of us and is keeping away to-night,\"\nsaid the doctor.",
        "“Wait a bit, it does not generally appear before one o’clock,\"\nanswered his friend.",
        "They started talking again. One o’clock struck. There was not a\nsound about the house, nor in the street outside. Suddenly the\ndoctor lifted his finger.",
        "“Hush! Sesemann, don’t you hear something?”",
        "They both listened, and they distinctly heard the bar softly\npushed aside and then the key turned in the lock and the door\nopened. Herr Sesemann put out his hand for his revolver.",
        "“You are not afraid, are you?” said the doctor as he stood up.",
        "“It is better to take precautions,” whispered Herr Sesemann, and\nseizing one of the lights in his other hand, he followed the\ndoctor, who, armed in like manner with a light and a revolver,\nwent softly on in front. They stepped into the hall. The\nmoonlight was shining in through the open door and fell on a\nwhite figure standing motionless in the doorway.",
        "“Who is there?” thundered the doctor in a voice that echoed\nthrough the hall, as the two men advanced with lights and\nweapons towards the figure.",
        "It turned and gave a low cry. There in her little white\nnightgown stood Heidi, with bare feet, staring with wild eyes at\nthe lights and the revolvers, and trembling from head to foot\nlike a leaf in the wind. The two men looked as one another in\nsurprise.",
        "“Why, I believe it is your little water-carrier, Sesemann,” said\nthe doctor.",
        "“Child, what does this mean?” said Herr Sesemann. “What did you\nwant? why did you come down here?”",
        "White with terror, and hardly able to make her voice heard,\nHeidi answered, “I don’t know.”",
        "But now the doctor stepped forward. “This is a matter for me to\nsee to, Sesemann; go back to your chair. I must take the child\nupstairs to her bed.”",
        "And with that he put down his revolver and gently taking the\nchild by the hand led her upstairs. “Don’t be frightened,” he\nsaid as they went up side by side, “it’s nothing to be\nfrightened about; it’s all right, only just go quietly.”",
        "On reaching Heidi’s room the doctor put the candle down on the\ntable, and taking Heidi up in his arms laid her on the bed and\ncarefully covered her over. Then he sat down beside her and\nwaited until Heidi had grown quieter and no longer trembled so\nviolently. He took her hand and said in a kind, soothing voice,\n\"There, now you feel better, and now tell me where you were\nwanting to go to?”",
        "“I did not want to go anywhere,” said Heidi. “I did not know I\nwent downstairs, but all at once I was there.”",
        "“I see, and had you been dreaming, so that you seemed to see and\nhear something very distinctly?”",
        "“Yes, I dream every night, and always about the same things. I\nthink I am back with the grandfather and I hear the sound in the\nfir trees outside, and I see the stars shining so brightly, and\nthen I open the door quickly and run out, and it is all so\nbeautiful! But when I wake I am still in Frankfurt.” And Heidi\nstruggled as she spoke to keep back the sobs which seemed to\nchoke her.",
        "“And have you no pain anywhere? no pain in your head or back?”",
        "“No, only a feeling as if there were a great stone weighing on\nme here.”",
        "“As if you had eaten something that would not go down.”",
        "“No, not like that; something heavy as if I wanted to cry very\nmuch.”",
        "“I see, and then do you have a good cry?”",
        "“Oh, no, I mustn’t; Fraulein Rottenmeier forbade me to cry.”",
        "“So you swallow it all down, I suppose? Are you happy here in\nFrankfurt?”",
        "“Yes,” was the low answer; but it sounded more like “No.”",
        "“And where did you live with your grandfather?”",
        "“Up on the mountain.”",
        "“That wasn’t very amusing; rather dull at times, eh?”",
        "“No, no, it was beautiful, beautiful!” Heidi could go no\nfurther; the remembrance of the past, the excitement she had just\ngone through, the long suppressed weeping, were too much for the\nchild’s strength; the tears began to fall fast, and she broke\ninto violent weeping.",
        "The doctor stood up and laid her head kindly down on the pillow.\n\"There, there, go on crying, it will do you good, and then go to\nsleep; it will be all right to-morrow.”",
        "Then he left the room and went downstairs to Herr Sesemann; when\nhe was once more sitting in the armchair opposite his friend,\n\"Sesemann,” he said, “let me first tell you that your little\ncharge is a sleep-walker; she is the ghost who has nightly\nopened the front door and put your household into this fever of\nalarm. Secondly, the child is consumed with homesickness, to such\nan extent that she is nearly a skeleton already, and soon will be\nquite one; something must be done at once. For the first\ntrouble, due to her over-excited nerves, there is but one remedy,\nto send her back to her native mountain air; and for the second\ntrouble there is also but one cure, and that the same. So to-\nmorrow the child must start for home; there you have my\nprescription.”",
        "Herr Sesemann had arisen and now paced up and down the room in\nthe greatest state of concern.",
        "“What!” he exclaimed, “the child a sleep-walker and ill! Home-\nsick, and grown emaciated in my house! All this has taken place\nin my house and no one seen or known anything about it! And you\nmean, doctor, that the child who came here happy and healthy, I\nam to send back to her grandfather a miserable little skeleton? I\ncan’t do it; you cannot dream of my doing such a thing! Take the\nchild in hand, do with her what you will, and make her whole and\nsound, and then she shall go home; but you must do something\nfirst.”",
        "“Sesemann,” replied the doctor, “consider what you are doing!\nThis illness of the child’s is not one to be cured with pills\nand powders. The child has not a tough constitution, but if you\nsend her back at once she may recover in the mountain air,\nif not–you would rather she went back ill than not at all?”",
        "Herr Sesemann stood still; the doctor’s words were a shock to\nhim.",
        "“If you put it so, doctor, there is assuredly only one way–and\nthe thing must be seen to at once.” And then he and the doctor\nwalked up and down for a while arranging what to do, after which\nthe doctor said good-bye, for some time had passed since they\nfirst sat down together, and as the master himself opened the\nhall door this time the morning light shone down through it into\nthe house.",
        "Herr Sesemann, a good deal irritated and excited, went quickly\nupstairs and along the passage to Fraulein Rottenmeier’s room,\nand there gave such an unusually loud knock at the door that the\nlady awoke from sleep with a cry of alarm. She heard the master\nof the house calling to her from the other side of the door,\n\"Please make haste and come down to me in the dining-room; we\nmust make ready for a journey at once.” Fraulein Rottenmeier\nlooked at her clock: it was just half-past four; she had never\ngot up so early before in her life. What could have happened?\nWhat with her curiosity and excitement she took hold of\neverything the wrong way, and it was a case with her of more\nhaste less speed, for she kept on searching everywhere for\ngarments which she had already put on.",
        "Meanwhile Herr Sesemann had gone on farther and rung the bells\nin turn which communicated with the several servants’ rooms,\ncausing frightened figures to leap out of bed, convinced that the\nghost had attacked the master and that he was calling for help.\nOne by one they made their appearance in the dining-room, each\nwith a more terrified face than the last, and were astonished to\nsee their master walking up and down, looking well and cheerful,\nand with no appearance of having had an encounter with a ghost.\nJohn was sent off without delay to get the horses and carriage\nready; Tinette was ordered to wake Heidi and get her dressed for\na journey; Sebastian was hurried off to the house where Dete was\nin service to bring the latter round. Then Fraulein Rottenmeier,\nhaving at last accomplished her toilet, came down, with\neverything well adjusted about her except her cap, which was put\non hind side before. Herr Sesemann put down her flurried\nappearance to the early awakening he had caused her, and began\nwithout delay to give her directions. She was to get out a trunk\nat once and pack up all the things belonging to the Swiss child–\nfor so he usually spoke of Heidi, being unaccustomed to her name–\nand a good part of Clara’s clothes as well, so that the child\nmight take home proper apparel; but everything was to be done\nimmediately, as there was no time for consideration.",
        "Fraulein Rottenmeier stood as if rooted to the spot and stared\nin astonishment at Herr Sesemann. She had quite expected a long\nand private account of some terrible ghostly experience of his\nduring the night, which she would have enjoyed hearing about in\nthe broad daylight. Instead of this there were these prosaic and\ntroublesome directions, which were so unexpected that she took\nsome time to get over her surprise and disappointment, and\ncontinued standing awaiting further explanation.",
        "But Herr Sesemann had no thought or time for explanations and\nleft her standing there while he went to speak to Clara. As he\nanticipated, the unusual commotion in the house had disturbed\nher, and she was lying and listening and wondering what had\nhappened. So he sat down and told her everything that had\noccurred during the past night, and explained that the doctor\nhad given his verdict and pronounced Heidi to be in a very highly\nstrung state, so that her nightly wanderings might gradually\nlead her farther and farther, perhaps even on to the roof, which\nof course would be very dangerous for her. And so they had\ndecided to send her home at once, as he did not like to take the\nresponsibility of her remaining, and Clara would see for herself\nthat it was the only thing to do. Clara was very much\ndistressed, and at first made all kinds of suggestions for\nkeeping Heidi with her; but her father was firm, and promised\nher, if she would be reasonable and make no further fuss, that he\nwould take her to Switzerland next summer. So Clara gave in to\nthe inevitable, only stipulating that the box might be brought\ninto her room to be packed, so that she might add whatever she\nliked, and her father was only too pleased to let her provide a\nnice outfit for the child. Meanwhile Dete had arrived and was\nwaiting in the hall, wondering what extraordinary event had come\nto pass for her to be sent for at such an unusual hour. Herr\nSesemann informed her of the state Heidi was in, and that he\nwished her that very day to take her home. Dete was greatly\ndisappointed, for she had not expected such a piece of news. She\nremembered Uncle’s last words, that he never wished to set eyes\non her again, and it seemed to her that to take back the child to\nhim, after having left it with him once and then taken it away\nagain, was not a safe or wise thing for her to do. So she excused\nherself to Herr Sesemann with her usual flow of words; to-day and\nto-morrow it would be quite impossible for her to take the\njourney, and there was so much to do that she doubted if she\ncould get off on any of the following days. Herr Sesemann\nunderstood that she was unwilling to go at all, and so dismissed\nher. Then he sent for Sebastian and told him to make ready to\nstart: he was to travel with the child as far as Basle that day,\nand the next day take her home. He would give him a letter to\ncarry to the grandfather, which would explain everything, and he\nhimself could come back by return.",
        "“But there is one thing in particular which I wish you to look\nafter,” said Herr Sesemann in conclusion, “and be sure you\nattend to what I say. I know the people of this hotel in Basle,\nthe name of which I give you on this card. They will see to\nproviding rooms for the child and you. When there, go at once\ninto the child’s room and see that the windows are all firmly\nfastened so that they cannot be easily opened. After the child is\nin bed, lock the door of her room on the outside, for the child\nwalks in her sleep and might run into danger in a strange house\nif she went wandering downstairs and tried to open the front\ndoor; so you understand?”",
        "“Oh! then that was it?” exclaimed Sebastian, for now a light was\nthrown on the ghostly visitations.",
        "“Yes, that was it! and you are a coward, and you may tell John\nhe is the same, and the whole household a pack of idiots.” And\nwith this Herr Sesemann went off to his study to write a letter\nto Alm-Uncle. Sebastian remained standing, feeling rather\nfoolish.",
        "“If only I had not let that fool of a John drag me back into the\nroom, and had gone after the little white figure, which I should\ndo certainly if I saw it now!” he kept on saying to himself; but\njust now every corner of the room was clearly visible in the\ndaylight.",
        "Meanwhile Heidi was standing expectantly dressed in her Sunday\nfrock waiting to see what would happen next, for Tinette had\nonly woke her up with a shake and put on her clothes without a\nword of explanation. The little uneducated child was far too much\nbeneath her for Tinette to speak to.",
        "Herr Sesemann went back to the dining-room with the letter;\nbreakfast was now ready, and he asked, “Where is the child?”",
        "Heidi was fetched, and as she walked up to him to say “Good-\nmorning,” he looked inquiringly into her face and said, “Well,\nwhat do you say to this, little one?”",
        "Heidi looked at him in perplexity.",
        "“Why, you don’t know anything about it, I see,” laughed Herr\nSesemann. “You are going home today, going at once.”",
        "“Home,” murmured Heidi in a low voice, turning pale; she was so\novercome that for a moment or two she could hardly breathe.",
        "“Don’t you want to hear more about it?”",
        "“Oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed Heidi, her face now rosy with delight.",
        "“All right, then,” said Herr Sesemann as he sat down and made\nher a sign to do the same, “but now make a good breakfast, and\nthen off you go in the carriage.”",
        "But Heidi could not swallow a morsel though she tried to do what\nshe was told; she was in such a state of excitement that she\nhardly knew if she was awake or dreaming, or if she would again\nopen her eyes to find herself in her nightgown at the front\ndoor.",
        "“Tell Sebastian to take plenty of provisions with him,” Herr\nSesemann called out to Fraulein Rottenmeier, who just then came\ninto the room; “the child can’t eat anything now, which is quite\nnatural. Now run up to Clara and stay with her till the carriage\ncomes round,” he added kindly, turning to Heidi.",
        "Heidi had been longing for this, and ran quickly upstairs. An\nimmense trunk was standing open in the middle of the room.",
        "“Come along, Heidi,” cried Clara, as she entered; “see all the\nthings I have had put in for you–aren’t you pleased?”",
        "And she ran over a list of things, dresses and aprons and\nhandkerchiefs, and all kinds of working materials. “And look\nhere,” she added, as she triumphantly held up a basket. Heidi\npeeped in and jumped for joy, for inside it were twelve\nbeautiful round white rolls, all for grandmother. In their\ndelight the children forgot that the time had come for them to\nseparate, and when some one called out, “The carriage is here,\"\nthere was no time for grieving.",
        "Heidi ran to her room to fetch her darling book; she knew no one\ncould have packed that, as it lay under her pillow, for Heidi\nhad kept it by her night and day. This was put in the basket with\nthe rolls. Then she opened her wardrobe to look for another\ntreasure, which perhaps no one would have thought of packing–and\nshe was right–the old red shawl had been left behind, Fraulein\nRottenmeier not considering it worth putting in with the other\nthings. Heidi wrapped it round something else which she laid on\nthe top of the basket, so that the red package was quite\nconspicuous. Then she put on her pretty hat and left the room.\nThe children could not spend much time over their farewells, for\nHerr Sesemann was waiting to put Heidi in the carriage. Fraulein\nRottenmeier was waiting at the top of the stairs to say good-bye\nto her. When she caught sight of the strange little red bundle,\nshe took it out of the basket and threw it on the ground. “No,\nno, Adelaide,” she exclaimed, “you cannot leave the house with\nthat thing. What can you possibly want with it!” And then she\nsaid good-bye to the child. Heidi did not dare take up her\nlittle bundle, but she gave the master of the house an imploring\nlook, as if her greatest treasure had been taken from her.",
        "“No, no,” said Herr Sesemann in a very decided voice, “the child\nshall take home with her whatever she likes, kittens and\ntortoises, if it pleases her; we need not put ourselves out\nabout that, Fraulein Rottenmeier.”",
        "Heidi quickly picked up her bundle, with a look of joy and\ngratitude. As she stood by the carriage door, Herr Sesemann gave\nher his hand and said he hoped she would remember him and Clara.\nHe wished her a happy journey, and Heidi thanked him for all his\nkindness, and added, “And please say good-bye to the doctor for\nme and give him many, many thanks.” For she had not forgotten\nthat he had said to her the night before, ’It will be all right\nto-morrow,’ and she rightly divined that he had helped to make\nit so for her. Heidi was now lifted into the carriage, and then\nthe basket and the provisions were put in, and finally Sebastian\ntook his place. Then Herr Sesemann called out once more, “A\npleasant journey to you,” and the carriage rolled away.",
        "Heidi was soon sitting in the railway carriage, holding her\nbasket tightly on her lap; she would not let it out of her hands\nfor a moment, for it contained the delicious rolls for\ngrandmother; so she must keep it carefully, and even peep inside\nit from time to time to enjoy the sight of them. For many hours\nshe sat as still as a mouse; only now was she beginning to\nrealize that she was going home to the grandfather, the\nmountain, the grandmother, and Peter, and pictures of all she was\ngoing to see again rose one by one before her eyes; she thought\nof how everything would look at home, but this brought other\nthoughts to her mind, and all of a sudden she said anxiously,\n\"Sebastian, are you sure that grandmother on the mountain is not\ndead?”",
        "“No, no,” said Sebastian, wishing to soothe her, “we will hope\nnot; she is sure to be alive still.”",
        "Then Heidi fell back on her own thoughts again. Now and then she\nlooked inside the basket, for the thing she looked forward to\nmost was laying all the rolls out on grandmother’s table. After\na long silence she spoke again, “If only we could know for\ncertain that grandmother is alive!”",
        "“Yes, yes,” said Sebastian, half asleep; “she is sure to be\nalive, there is no reason why she should be dead.”",
        "After a while sleep fell on Heidi too, and after her disturbed\nnight and early rising she slept so soundly that she did not\nwake till Sebastian shook her by the arm and called to her, “Wake\nup, wake up! we shall have to get out directly; we are just in\nBasle!”",
        "There was a further railway journey of many hours the next day.\nHeidi again sat with her basket on her knee, for she would not\nhave given it up to Sebastian on any consideration; to-day she\nnever even opened her mouth, for her excitement, which increased\nwith every mile of the journey, kept her speechless. All of a\nsudden, before Heidi expected it, a voice called out,\n\"Mayenfeld.” She and Sebastian both jumped up, the latter also\ntaken by surprise. In another minute they were both standing on\nthe platform with Heidi’s trunk, and the train was steaming away\ndown the valley. Sebastian looked after it regretfully, for he\npreferred the easier mode of travelling to a wearisome climb on\nfoot, especially as there was danger no doubt as well as fatigue\nin a country like this, where, according to Sebastian’s idea,\neverything and everybody were half savage. He therefore looked\ncautiously to either side to see who was a likely person to ask\nthe safest way to Dorfli.",
        "Just outside the station he saw a shabby-looking little cart and\nhorse which a broad-shouldered man was loading with heavy sacks\nthat had been brought by the train, so he went up to him and\nasked which was the safest way to get to Dorfli.",
        "“All the roads about here are safe,” was the curt reply.",
        "So Sebastian altered his question and asked which was the best\nway to avoid falling over the precipice, and also how a box\ncould be conveyed to Dorfli. The man looked at the box, weighing\nit with his eye, and then volunteered if it was not too heavy to\ntake it on his own cart, as he was driving to Dorfli. After some\nlittle interchange of words it was finally agreed that the man\nshould take both the child and the box to Dorfli, and there find\nsome one who could be sent on with Heidi up the mountain.",
        "“I can go by myself, I know the way well from Dorfli,” put in\nHeidi, who had been listening attentively to the conversation.\nSebastian was greatly relieved at not having to do any mountain\nclimbing. He drew Heidi aside and gave her a thick rolled\nparcel, and a letter for her grandfather; the parcel, he told\nher, was a present from Herr Sesemann, and she must put it at the\nbottom of her basket under the rolls and be very careful not to\nlose it, as Herr Sesemann would be very vexed if she did, and\nnever be the same to her again; so little miss was to think well\nof what he said.",
        "“I shall be sure not to lose it,” said Heidi confidently, and\nshe at once put the roll and the letter at the bottom of her\nbasket. The trunk meanwhile had been hoisted into the cart, and\nnow Sebastian lifted Heidi and her basket on to the high seat and\nshook hands with her; he then made signs to her to keep her eye\non the basket, for the driver was standing near and Sebastian\nthought it better to be careful, especially as he knew that he\nought himself to have seen the child safely to her journey’s\nend. The driver now swung himself up beside Heidi, and the cart\nrolled away in the direction of the mountains, while Sebastian,\nglad of having no tiring and dangerous journey on foot before\nhim, sat down in the station and awaited the return train.",
        "The driver of the car was the miller at Dorfli and was taking\nhome his sacks of flour. He had never seen Heidi, but like\neverybody in Dorfli knew all about her. He had known her\nparents, and felt sure at once that this was the child of whom he\nhad heard so much. He began to wonder why she had come back, and\nas they drove along he entered into conversation with her. “You\nare the child who lived with your grandfather, Alm-Uncle, are you\nnot?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Didn’t they treat you well down there that you have come back\nso soon?”",
        "“Yes, it was not that; everything in Frankfurt is as nice as it\ncould be.”",
        "“Then why are you running home again?”",
        "“Only because Herr Sesemann gave me leave, or else I should not\nhave come.”",
        "“If they were willing to let you stay, why did you not remain\nwhere you were better off than at home?”",
        "“Because I would a thousand times rather be with grandfather on\nthe mountain than anywhere else in the world.”",
        "“You will think differently perhaps when you get back there,\"\ngrumbled the miller; and then to himself, “It’s strange of her,\nfor she must know what it’s like.”",
        "He began whistling and said no more, while Heidi looked around\nher and began to tremble with excitement, for she knew every\ntree along the way, and there overhead were the high jagged peaks\nof the mountain looking down on her like old friends. And Heidi\nnodded back to them, and grew every moment more wild with her\njoy and longing, feeling as if she must jump down from the cart\nand run with all her might till she reached the top. But she sat\nquite still and did not move, although inwardly in such\nagitation. The clock was striking five as they drove into\nDorfli. A crowd of women and children immediately surrounded the\ncart, for the box and the child arriving with the miller had\nexcited the curiosity of everybody in the neighborhood,\ninquisitive to know whence they came and whither they were going\nand to whom they belonged. As the miller lifted Heidi down, she\nsaid hastily, “Thank you, grandfather will send for the trunk,\"\nand was just going to run off, when first one and then another of\nthe bystanders caught hold of her, each one having a different\nquestion to put to her. But Heidi pushed her way through them\nwith such an expression of distress on her face that they were\nforced to let her go. “You see,” they said to one another, “how\nfrightened she is, and no wonder,” and then they went on to talk\nof Alm-Uncle, how much worse he had grown that last year, never\nspeaking a word and looking as if he would like to kill\neverybody he met, and if the child had anywhere else to go to she\ncertainly would not run back to the old dragon’s den. But here\nthe miller interrupted them, saying he knew more about it than\nthey did, and began telling them how a kind gentleman had brought\nher to Mayenfeld and seen her off, and had given him his fare\nwithout any bargaining, and extra money for himself; what was\nmore, the child had assured him that she had had everything she\nwanted where she had been, and that it was her own wish to return\nto her grandfather. This information caused great surprise and\nwas soon repeated all over Dorfli, and that evening there was not\na house in the place in which the astounding news was not\ndiscussed, of how Heidi had of her own accord given up a\nluxurious home to return to her grandfather.",
        "Heidi climbed up the steep path from Dorfli as quickly as she\ncould; she was obliged, however, to pause now and again to take\nbreath, for the basket she carried was rather heavy, and the way\ngot steeper as she drew nearer the top. One thought alone filled\nHeidi’s mind, “Would she find the grandmother sitting in her\nusual corner by the spinning-wheel, was she still alive?” At\nlast Heidi caught sight of the grandmother’s house in the hollow\nof the mountain and her heart began to beat; she ran faster and\nfaster and her heart beat louder and louder–and now she had\nreached the house, but she trembled so she could hardly open the\ndoor–and then she was standing inside, unable in her\nbreathlessness to utter a sound.",
        "“Ah, my God!” cried a voice from the corner, “that was how Heidi\nused to run in; if only I could have her with me once again! Who\nis there?”",
        "“It’s I, I, grandmother,” cried Heidi as she ran and flung\nherself on her knees beside the old woman, and seizing her\nhands, clung to her, unable to speak for joy. And the grandmother\nherself could not say a word for some time, so unexpected was\nthis happiness; but at last she put out her hand and stroked\nHeidi’s curly hair, and said, “Yes, yes, that is her hair, and\nher voice; thank God that He has granted my prayer!” And tears\nof joy fell from the blind eyes on to Heidi’s hand. “Is it really\nyou, Heidi; have you really come back to me?”",
        "“Yes, grandmother, I am really here,” answered Heidi in a\nreassuring voice. “Do not cry, for I have really come back and I\nam never going away again, and I shall come every day to see\nyou, and you won’t have any more hard bread to eat for some days,\nfor look, look!”",
        "And Heidi took the rolls from the basket and piled the whole\ntwelve up on grandmother’s lap.",
        "“Ah, child! child! what a blessing you bring with you!” the old\nwoman exclaimed, as she felt and seemed never to come to the end\nof the rolls. “But you yourself are the greatest blessing,\nHeidi,” and again she touched the child’s hair and passed her\nhand over her hot cheeks, and said, “Say something, child, that\nI may hear your voice.”",
        "Then Heidi told her how unhappy she had been, thinking that the\ngrandmother might die while she was away and would never have\nher white rolls, and that then she would never, never see her\nagain.",
        "Peter’s mother now came in and stood for a moment overcome with\nastonishment. “Why, it’s Heidi,” she exclaimed, “and yet can it\nbe?”",
        "Heidi stood up, and Brigitta now could not say enough in her\nadmiration of the child’s dress and appearance; she walked round\nher, exclaiming all the while, “Grandmother, if you could only\nsee her, and see what a pretty frock she has on; you would\nhardly know her again. And the hat with the feather in it is\nyours too, I suppose? Put it on that I may see how you look in\nit?”",
        "“No, I would rather not,” replied Heidi firmly. “You can have it\nif you like; I do not want it; I have my own still.” And Heidi\nso saying undid her red bundle and took out her own old hat,\nwhich had become a little more battered still during the journey.\nBut this was no trouble to Heidi; she had not forgotten how her\ngrandfather had called out to Dete that he never wished to see\nher and her hat and feathers again, and this was the reason she\nhad so anxiously preserved her old hat, for she had never ceased\nto think about going home to her grandfather. But Brigitta told\nher not to be so foolish as to give it away; she would not think\nof taking such a beautiful hat; if Heidi did not want to wear it\nshe might sell it to the schoolmaster’s daughter in Dorfli and\nget a good deal of money for it. But Heidi stuck to her\nintention and hid the hat quietly in a corner behind the\ngrandmother’s chair. Then she took off her pretty dress and put\nher red shawl on over her under-petticoat, which left her arms\nbare; and now she clasped the old woman’s hand. “I must go home\nto grandfather,” she said, “but to-morrow I shall come again. Good-\nnight, grandmother.”",
        "“Yes, come again, be sure you come again tomorrow,” begged the\ngrandmother, as she pressed Heidi’s hands in hers, unwilling to\nlet her go.",
        "“Why have you taken off that pretty dress?” asked Brigitta.",
        "“Because I would rather go home to grandfather as I am or else\nperhaps he would not know me; you hardly did at first.”",
        "Brigitta went with her to the door, and there said in rather a\nmysterious voice, “You might have kept on your dress, he would\nhave known you all right; but you must be careful, for Peter\ntells me that Alm-Uncle is always now in a bad temper and never\nspeaks.”",
        "Heidi bid her good-night and continued her way up the mountain,\nher basket on her arm. All around her the steep green slopes\nshone bright in the evening sun, and soon the great gleaming snow-\nfield up above came in sight. Heidi was obliged to keep on\npausing to look behind her, for the higher peaks were behind her\nas she climbed. Suddenly a warm red glow fell on the grass at\nher feet; she looked back again–she had not remembered how\nsplendid it was, nor seen anything to compare to it in her dreams–\nfor there the two high mountain peeks rose into the air like two\ngreat flames, the whole snow-field had turned crimson, and rosy-\ncolored clouds floated in the sky above. The grass upon the\nmountain sides had turned to gold, the rocks were all aglow, and\nthe whole valley was bathed in golden mist. And as Heidi stood\ngazing around her at all this splendor the tears ran down her\ncheeks for very delight and happiness, and impulsively she put\nher hands together, and lifting her eyes to heaven, thanked God\naloud for having brought her home, thanked Him that everything\nwas as beautiful as ever, more beautiful even than she had\nthought, and that it was all hers again once more. And she was so\noverflowing with joy and thankfulness that she could not find\nwords to thank Him enough. Not until the glory began to fade\ncould she tear herself away. Then she ran on so quickly that in\na very little while she caught sight of the tops of the fir trees\nabove the hut roof, then the roof itself, and at last the whole\nhut, and there was grandfather sitting as in old days smoking\nhis pipe, and she could see the fir trees waving in the wind.\nQuicker and quicker went her little feet, and before Alm-Uncle\nhad time to see who was coming, Heidi had rushed up to him,\nthrown down her basket and flung her arms round his neck, unable\nin the excitement of seeing him again to say more than\n\"Grandfather! grandfather! grandfather!” over and over again.",
        "And the old man himself said nothing. For the first time for\nmany years his eyes were wet, and he had to pass his hand across\nthem. Then he unloosed Heidi’s arms, put her on his knee, and\nafter looking at her for a moment, “So you have come back to me,\nHeidi,” he said, “how is that? You don’t look much of a grand\nlady. Did they send you away?”",
        "“Oh, no, grandfather,” said Heidi eagerly, “you must not think\nthat; they were all so kind–Clara, and grandmamma, and Herr\nSesemann. But you see, grandfather, I did not know how to bear\nmyself till I got home again to you. I used to think I should\ndie, for I felt as if I could not breathe; but I never said\nanything because it would have been ungrateful. And then\nsuddenly one morning quite early Herr Sesemann said to me–but I\nthink it was partly the doctor’s doing–but perhaps it’s all in\nthe letter–” and Heidi jumped down and fetched the roll and the\nletter and handed them both to her grandfather.",
        "“That belongs to you,” said the latter, laying the roll down on\nthe bench beside him. Then he opened the letter, read it through\nand without a word put it in his pocket.",
        "“Do you think you can still drink milk with me, Heidi?” he\nasked, taking the child by the hand to go into the hut. “But\nbring your money with you; you can buy a bed and bedclothes and\ndresses for a couple of years with it.”",
        "“I am sure I do not want it,” replied Heidi. “I have got a bed\nalready, and Clara has put such a lot of clothes in my box that\nI shall never want any more.”",
        "“Take it and put it in the cupboard; you will want it some day I\nhave no doubt.”",
        "Heidi obeyed and skipped happily after her grandfather into the\nhouse; she ran into all the corners, delighted to see everything\nagain, and then went up the ladder–but there she came to a\npause and called down in a tone of surprise and distress, “Oh,\ngrandfather, my bed’s gone.”",
        "“We can soon make it up again,” he answered her from below. “I\ndid not know that you were coming back; come along now and have\nyour milk.”",
        "Heidi came down, sat herself on her high stool in the old place,\nand then taking up her bowl drank her milk eagerly, as if she\nhad never come across anything so delicious, and as she put down\nher bowl, she exclaimed, “Our milk tastes nicer than anything\nelse in the world, grandfather.”",
        "A shrill whistle was heard outside. Heidi darted out like a\nflash of lightning. There were the goats leaping and springing\namong the rocks, with Peter in their midst. When he caught sight\nof Heidi he stood still with astonishment and gazed speechlessly\nat her. Heidi called out, “Good-evening, Peter,” and then ran in\namong the goats. “Little Swan! Little Bear! do you know me\nagain?” And the animals evidently recognized her voice at once,\nfor they began rubbing their heads against her and bleating\nloudly as if for joy, and as she called the other goats by name\none after the other, they all came scampering towards her helter-\nskelter and crowding round her. The impatient Greenfinch sprang\ninto the air and over two of her companions in order to get\nnearer, and even the shy little Snowflake butted the Great Turk\nout of her way in quite a determined manner, which left him\nstanding taken aback by her boldness, and lifting his beard in\nthe air as much as to say, You see who I am.",
        "Heidi was out of her mind with delight at being among all her\nold friends again; she flung her arms round the pretty little\nSnowflake, stroked the obstreperous Greenfinch, while she\nherself was thrust at from all sides by the affectionate and\nconfiding goats; and so at last she got near to where Peter was\nstill standing, not having yet got over his surprise.",
        "“Come down, Peter,” cried Heidi, “and say good-evening to me.”",
        "“So you are back again?” he found words to say at last, and now\nran down and took Heidi’s hand which she was holding out in\ngreeting, and immediately put the same question to her which he\nhad been in the habit of doing in the old days when they\nreturned home in the evening, “Will you come out with me again to-\nmorrow?”",
        "“Not to-morrow, but the day after perhaps, for to-morrow I must\ngo down to grandmother.”",
        "“I am glad you are back,” said Peter, while his whole face\nbeamed with pleasure, and then he prepared to go on with his\ngoats; but he never had had so much trouble with them before, for\nwhen at last, by coaxing and threats, he had got them all\ntogether, and Heidi had gone off with an arm over either head of\nher grandfather’s two, the whole flock suddenly turned and ran\nafter her. Heidi had to go inside the stall with her two and shut\nthe door, or Peter would never have got home that night. When\nHeidi went indoors after this she found her bed already made up\nfor her; the hay had been piled high for it and smelt\ndeliciously, for it had only just been got in, and the\ngrandfather had carefully spread and tucked in the clean sheets.\nIt was with a happy heart that Heidi lay down in it that night,\nand her sleep was sounder than it had been for a whole year past.\nThe grandfather got up at least ten times during the night and\nmounted the ladder to see if Heidi was all right and showing no\nsigns of restlessness, and to feel that the hay he had stuffed\ninto the round window was keeping the moon from shining too\nbrightly upon her. But Heidi did not stir; she had no need now\nto wander about, for the great burning longing of her heart was\nsatisfied; she had seen the high mountains and rocks alight in\nthe evening glow, she had heard the wind in the fir trees, she\nwas at home again on the mountain.",
        "Heidi was standing under the waving fir trees waiting for her\ngrandfather, who was going down with her to grandmother’s, and\nthen on to Dorfli to fetch her box. She was longing to know how\ngrandmother had enjoyed her white bread and impatient to see and\nhear her again; but no time seemed weary to her now, for she\ncould not listen long enough to the familiar voice of the trees,\nor drink in too much of the fragrance wafted to her from the\ngreen pastures where the golden-headed flowers were glowing in\nthe sun, a very feast to her eyes. The grandfather came out,\ngave a look round, and then called to her in a cheerful voice,\n\"Well, now we can be off.”",
        "It was Saturday, a day when Alm-Uncle made everything clean and\ntidy inside and outside the house; he had devoted his morning to\nthis work so as to be able to accompany Heidi in the afternoon,\nand the whole place was now as spick and span as he liked to see\nit. They parted at the grandmother’s cottage and Heidi ran in.\nThe grandmother had heard her steps approaching and greeted her\nas she crossed the threshold, “Is it you, child? Have you come\nagain?”",
        "Then she took hold of Heidi’s hand and held it fast in her own,\nfor she still seemed to fear that the child might be torn from\nher again. And now she had to tell Heidi how much she had\nenjoyed the white bread, and how much stronger she felt already\nfor having been able to eat it, and then Peter’s mother went on\nand said she was sure that if her mother could eat like that for\na week she would get back some of her strength, but she was so\nafraid of coming to the end of the rolls, that she had only\neaten one as yet. Heidi listened to all Brigitta said, and sat\nthinking for a while. Then she suddenly thought of a way.",
        "“I know, grandmother, what I will do,” she said eagerly, “I will\nwrite to Clara, and she will send me as many rolls again, if not\ntwice as many as you have already, for I had ever such a large\nheap in the wardrobe, and when they were all taken away she\npromised to give me as many back, and she would do so I am\nsure.”",
        "“That is a good idea,” said Brigitta; “but then, they would get\nhard and stale. The baker in Dorfli makes the white rolls, and\nif we could get some of those he has over now and then–but I can\nonly just manage to pay for the black bread.”",
        "A further bright thought came to Heidi, and with a look of joy,\n\"Oh, I have lots of money, grandmother,” she cried gleefully,\nskipping about the room in her delight, “and I know now what I\nwill do with it. You must have a fresh white roll every day, and\ntwo on Sunday, and Peter can bring them up from Dorfli.”",
        "“No, no, child!” answered the grandmother, “I cannot let you do\nthat; the money was not given to you for that purpose; you must\ngive it to your grandfather, and he will tell you how you are to\nspend it.”",
        "But Heidi was not to be hindered in her kind intentions, and she\ncontinued to jump about, saying over and over again in a tone of\nexultation, “Now, grandmother can have a roll every day and will\ngrow quite strong again–and, Oh, grandmother,” she suddenly\nexclaimed with an increase of jubilation in her voice, “if you\nget strong everything will grow light again for you; perhaps\nit’s only because you are weak that it is dark.” The grandmother\nsaid nothing, she did not wish to spoil the child’s pleasure. As\nshe went jumping about Heidi suddenly caught sight of the\ngrandmother’s song book, and another happy idea struck her,\n\"Grandmother, I can also read now, would you like me to read you\none of your hymns from your old book?”",
        "“Oh, yes,” said the grandmother, surprised and delighted; “but\ncan you really read, child, really?”",
        "Heidi had climbed on to a chair and had already lifted down the\nbook, bringing a cloud of dust with it, for it had lain\nuntouched on the shelf for a long time. Heidi wiped it, sat\nherself down on a stool beside the old woman, and asked her which\nhymn she should read.",
        "“What you like, child, what you like,” and the grandmother\npushed her spinning-wheel aside and sat in eager expectation\nwaiting for Heidi to begin. Heidi turned over the leaves and read\na line out softly to herself here and there. At last she said,",
        "“Here is one about the sun, grandmother, I will read you that.\"\nAnd Heidi began, reading with more and more warmth of expression\nas she went on,–",
        "     The morning breaks,\n      And warm and bright\n      The earth lies still\n      In the golden light–\n  For Dawn has scattered the clouds of night.",
        "     God’s handiwork\n      Is seen around,\n      Things great and small\n      To His praise abound–\n  Where are the signs of His love not found?",
        "     All things must pass,\n      But God shall still\n      With steadfast power\n      His will fulfil–\n  Sure and unshaken is His will.",
        "     His saving grace\n      Will never fail,\n      Though grief and fear\n      The heart assail–\n  O’er life’s wild seas He will prevail.",
        "     Joy shall be ours\n      In that garden blest,\n      Where after storm\n      We find our rest–\n  I wait in peace–God’s time is best.",
        "The grandmother sat with folded hands and a look of indescribable\njoy on her face, such as Heidi had never seen there before,\nalthough at the same time the tears were running down her cheeks.\nAs Heidi finished, she implored her, saying, “Read it once again,\nchild, just once again.”",
        "And the child began again, with as much pleasure in the verses\nas the grandmother,–",
        "     Joy shall be ours\n      In that garden blest,\n      Where after storm\n      We find our rest–\n  I wait in peace–God’s time is best.",
        "“Ah, Heidi, that brings light to the heart! What comfort you\nhave brought me!”",
        "And the old woman kept on repeating the glad words, while Heidi\nbeamed with happiness, and she could not take her eyes away from\nthe grandmother’s face, which had never looked like that before.\nIt had no longer the old troubled expression, but was alight\nwith peace and joy as if she were already looking with clear new\neyes into the garden or Paradise.",
        "Some one now knocked at the window and Heidi looked up and saw\nher grandfather beckoning her to come home with him. She\npromised the grandmother before leaving her that she would be\nwith her the next day, and even if she went out with Peter she\nwould only spend half the day with him, for the thought that she\nmight make it light and happy again for the grandmother gave her\nthe greatest pleasure, greater even than being out on the sunny\nmountain with the flowers and goats. As she was going out\nBrigitta ran to her with the frock and hat she had left. Heidi\nput the dress over her arm, for, as she thought to herself, the\ngrandfather had seen that before, but she obstinately refused to\ntake back the hat; Brigitta could keep it, for she should never\nput it on her head again. Heidi was so full of her morning’s\ndoings that she began at once to tell her grandfather all about\nthem: how the white bread could be fetched every day from Dorfli\nif there was money for it, and how the grandmother had all at\nonce grown stronger and happier, and light had come to her. Then\nshe returned to the subject of the rolls. “If the grandmother\nwon’t take the money, grandfather, will you give it all to me,\nand I can then give Peter enough every day to buy a roll and two\non Sunday?”",
        "“But how about the bed?” said her grandfather. “It would be nice\nfor you to have a proper bed, and there would then be plenty for\nthe bread.”",
        "But Heidi gave her grandfather no peace till he consented to do\nwhat she wanted; she slept a great deal better, she said, on her\nbed of hay than on her fine pillowed bed in Frankfurt. So at\nlast he said, “The money is yours, do what you like with it; you\ncan buy bread for grandmother for years to come with it.”",
        "Heidi shouted for joy at the thought that grandmother would\nnever need any more to eat hard black bread, and “Oh,\ngrandfather!” she said, “everything is happier now than it has\never been in our lives before!” and she sang and skipped along,\nholding her grandfather’s hand as light-hearted as a bird. But\nall at once she grew quiet and said, “If God had let me come at\nonce, as I prayed, then everything would have been different, I\nshould only have had a little bread to bring to grandmother, and\nI should not have been able to read, which is such a comfort to\nher; but God has arranged it all so much better than I knew how\nto; everything has happened just as the other grandmother said it\nwould. Oh, how glad I am that God did not let me have at once all\nI prayed and wept for! And now I shall always pray to God as she\ntold me, and always thank Him, and when He does not do anything I\nask for I shall think to myself, It’s just like it was in\nFrankfurt: God, I am sure, is going to do something better still.\nSo we will pray every day, won’t we, grandfather, and never\nforget Him again, or else He may forget us.”",
        "“And supposing one does forget Him?” said the grandfather in a\nlow voice.",
        "“Then everything goes wrong, for God lets us then go where we\nlike, and when we get poor and miserable and begin to cry about\nit no one pities us, but they say, You ran away from God, and so\nGod, who could have helped you, left you to yourself.”",
        "“That is true, Heidi; where did you learn that?”",
        "“From grandmamma; she explained it all to me.”",
        "The grandfather walked on for a little while without speaking,\nthen he said, as if following his own train of thought: “And if\nit once is so, it is so always; no one can go back, and he whom\nGod has forgotten, is forgotten for ever.”",
        "“Oh, no, grandfather, we can go back, for grandmamma told me so,\nand so it was in the beautiful tale in my book–but you have not\nheard that yet; but we shall be home directly now, and then I\nwill read it you, and you will see how beautiful it is.” And in\nher eagerness Heidi struggled faster and faster up the steep\nascent, and they were no sooner at the top than she let go her\ngrandfather’s hand and ran into the hut. The grandfather slung\nthe basket off his shoulders in which he had brought up a part\nof the contents of the trunk which was too heavy to carry up as\nit was. Then he sat down on his seat and began thinking.",
        "Heidi soon came running out with her book under her arm. “That’s\nright, grandfather,” she exclaimed as she saw he had already\ntaken his seat, and in a second she was beside him and had her\nbook open at the particular tale, for she had read it so often\nthat the leaves fell open at it of their own accord. And now in\na sympathetic voice Heidi began to read of the son when he was\nhappily at home, and went out into the fields with his father’s\nflocks, and was dressed in a fine cloak, and stood leaning on\nhis shepherd’s staff watching as the sun went down, just as he\nwas to be seen in the picture. But then all at once he wanted to\nhave his own goods and money and to be his own master, and so he\nasked his father to give him his portion, and he left his home\nand went and wasted all his substance. And when he had nothing\nleft he hired himself out to a master who had no flocks and\nfields like his father, but only swine to keep; and so he was\nobliged to watch these, and he only had rags to wear and a few\nhusks to eat such as the swine fed upon. And then he thought of\nhis old happy life at home and of how kindly his father had\ntreated him and how ungrateful he had been, and he wept for\nsorrow and longing. And he thought to himself, “I will arise and\ngo to my father, and will say to him, ’Father, I am not worthy to\nbe called thy son; make me as one of thy hired servants.’” And\nwhen he was yet a great way off his father saw him . . . Here\nHeidi paused in her reading. “What do you think happens now,\ngrandfather?” she said. “Do you think the father is still angry\nand will say to him, ’I told you so!’ Well, listen now to what\ncomes next.” His father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and\nfell on his neck and kissed him. And the son said to him,\n\"Father, I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight, and am no\nmore worthy to be called thy son.” But the father said to his\nservants, “Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put\na ring on his hand and shoes on his feet: and bring hither the\nfatted calf and kill it; and let us eat and be merry, for this my\nson was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.” And\nthey began to be merry.",
        "“Isn’t that a beautiful tale, grandfather,” said Heidi, as the\nlatter continued to sit without speaking, for she had expected\nhim to express pleasure and astonishment.",
        "“You are right, Heidi; it is a beautiful tale,” he replied, but\nhe looked so grave as he said it that Heidi grew silent herself\nand sat looking quietly at her pictures. Presently she pushed\nher book gently in front of him and said, “See how happy he is\nthere,” and she pointed with her finger to the figure of the\nreturned prodigal, who was standing by his father clad in fresh\nraiment as one of his own sons again.",
        "A few hours later, as Heidi lay fast asleep in her bed, the\ngrandfather went up the ladder and put his lamp down near her\nbed so that the light fell on the sleeping child. Her hands were\nstill folded as if she had fallen asleep saying her prayers, an\nexpression of peace and trust lay on the little face, and\nsomething in it seemed to appeal to the grandfather, for he\nstood a long time gazing down at her without speaking. At last he\ntoo folded his hands, and with bowed head said in a low voice,\n\"Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee and am not\nworthy to be called thy son.” And two large tears rolled down\nthe old man’s cheeks.",
        "Early the next morning he stood in front of his hut and gazed\nquietly around him. The fresh bright morning sun lay on mountain\nand valley. The sound of a few early bells rang up from the\nvalley, and the birds were singing their morning song in the fir\ntrees. He stepped back into the hut and called up, “Come along,\nHeidi! the sun is up! Put on your best frock, for we are going\nto church together!”",
        "Heidi was not long getting ready; it was such an unusual summons\nfrom her grandfather that she must make haste. She put on her\nsmart Frankfurt dress and soon went down, but when she saw her\ngrandfather she stood still, gazing at him in astonishment.\n\"Why, grandfather!” she exclaimed, “I never saw you look like\nthat before! and the coat with the silver buttons! Oh, you do\nlook nice in your Sunday coat!”",
        "The old man smiled and replied, “And you too; now come along!\"\nHe took Heidi’s hand in his and together they walked down the\nmountain side. The bells were ringing in every direction now,\nsounding louder and fuller as they neared the valley, and Heidi\nlistened to them with delight. “Hark at them, grandfather! it’s\nlike a great festival!”",
        "The congregation had already assembled and the singing had begun\nwhen Heidi and her grandfather entered the church at Dorfli and\nsat down at the back. But before the hymn was over every one was\nnudging his neighbor and whispering, “Do you see? Alm-Uncle is\nin church!”",
        "Soon everybody in the church knew of Alm-Uncle’s presence, and\nthe women kept on turning round to look and quite lost their\nplace in the singing. But everybody became more attentive when\nthe sermon began, for the preacher spoke with such warmth and\nthankfulness that those present felt the effect of his words, as\nif some great joy had come to them all. At the close of the\nservice Alm-Uncle took Heidi by the hand, and on leaving the\nchurch made his way towards the pastor’s house; the rest of the\ncongregation looked curiously after him, some even following to\nsee whether he went inside the pastor’s house, which he did.\nThen they collected in groups and talked over this strange event,\nkeeping their eyes on the pastor’s door, watching to see whether\nAlm-Uncle came out looking angry and quarrelsome, or as if the\ninterview had been a peaceful one, for they could not imagine\nwhat had brought the old man down, and what it all meant. Some,\nhowever, adopted a new tone and expressed their opinion that Alm-\nUncle was not so bad after all as they thought, “for see how\ncarefully he took the little one by the hand.” And others\nresponded and said they had always thought people had\nexaggerated about him, that if he was so downright bad he would\nbe afraid to go inside the pastor’s house. Then the miller put in\nhis word, “Did I not tell you so from the first? What child is\nthere who would run away from where she had plenty to eat and\ndrink and everything of the best, home to a grandfather who was\ncruel and unkind, and of whom she was afraid?”",
        "And so everybody began to feel quite friendly towards Alm-Uncle,\nand the women now came up and related all they had been told by\nPeter and his grandmother, and finally they all stood there like\npeople waiting for an old friend whom they had long missed from\namong their number.",
        "Meanwhile Alm-Uncle had gone into the pastor’s house and knocked\nat the study door. The latter came out and greeted him, not as\nif he was surprised to see him, but as if he had quite expected\nto see him there; he probably had caught sight of the old man in\nchurch. He shook hands warmly with him, and Alm-Uncle was unable\nat first to speak, for he had not expected such a friendly\nreception. At last he collected himself and said, “I have come\nto ask you, pastor, to forget the words I spoke to you when you\ncalled on me, and to beg you not to owe me ill-will for having\nbeen so obstinately set against your well-meant advice. You were\nright, and I was wrong, but I have now made up my mind to follow\nyour advice and to find a place for myself at Dorfli for the\nwinter, for the child is not strong enough to stand the bitter\ncold up on the mountain. And if the people down here look\naskance at me, as at a person not to be trusted, I know it is my\nown fault, and you will, I am sure, not do so.”",
        "The pastor’s kindly eyes shone with pleasure. He pressed the old\nman’s hand in his, and said with emotion, “Neighbor, you went\ninto the right church before you came to mine; I am greatly\nrejoiced. You will not repent coming to live with us again; as\nfor myself you will always be welcome as a dear friend and\nneighbor, and I look forward to our spending many a pleasant\nwinter evening together, for I shall prize your companionship,\nand we will find some nice friends too for the little one.” And\nthe pastor laid his hand kindly on the child’s curly head and\ntook her by the hand as he walked to the door with the old man.\nHe did not say good-bye to him till they were standing outside,\nso that all the people standing about saw him shake hands as if\nparting reluctantly from his best friend. The door had hardly\nshut behind him before the whole congregation now came forward\nto greet Alm-Uncle, every one striving to be the first to shake\nhands with him, and so many were held out that Alm-Uncle did not\nknow with which to begin; and some said, “We are so pleased to\nsee you among us again,” and another, “I have long been wishing\nwe could have a talk together again,” and greetings of all kinds\nechoed from every side, and when Alm-Uncle told them he was\nthinking of returning to his old quarters in Dorfli for the\nwinter, there was such a general chorus of pleasure that any one\nwould have thought he was the most beloved person in all Dorfli,\nand that they had hardly known how to live without him. Most of\nhis friends accompanied him and Heidi some way up the mountain,\nand each as they bid him good-bye made him promise that when he\nnext came down he would without fail come and call. As the old\nman at last stood alone with the child, watching their\nretreating figures, there was a light upon his face as if\nreflected from some inner sunshine of heart. Heidi, looking up at\nhim with her clear steady eyes, said, “Grandfather, you look\nnicer and nicer to-day, I never saw you quite like that before.”",
        "“Do you think so?” he answered with a smile. “Well, yes, Heidi,\nI am happier to-day than I deserve, happier than I had thought\npossible; it is good to be at peace with God and man! God was\ngood to me when He sent you to my hut.”",
        "When they reached Peter’s home the grandfather opened the door\nand walked straight in. “Good-morning, grandmother,” he said. “I\nthink we shall have to do some more patching, up before the\nautumn winds come.”",
        "“Dear God, if it is not Uncle!” cried the grandmother in pleased\nsurprise. “That I should live to see such a thing! and now I can\nthank you for all that you have done for me. May God reward you!\nmay God reward you!” She stretched out a trembling hand to him,\nand when the grandfather shook it warmly, she went on, still\nholding his, “And I have something on my heart I want to say, a\nprayer to make to you! If I have injured you in any way, do not\npunish me by sending the child away again before I lie under the\ngrass. Oh, you do not know what that child is to me!” and she\nclasped the child to her, for Heidi had already taken her usual\nstand close to the grandmother.",
        "“Have no fear, grandmother,” said Uncle in a reassuring voice,\n\"I shall not punish either you or myself by doing so. We are all\ntogether now, and pray God we may continue so for long.”",
        "Brigitta now drew the Uncle aside towards a corner of the room\nand showed him the hat with the feathers, explaining to him how\nit came there, and adding that of course she could not take such\na thing from a child.",
        "But the grandfather looked towards Heidi without any displeasure\nof countenance and said, “The hat is hers, and if she does not\nwish to wear it any more she has a right to say so and to give\nit to you, so take it, pray.”",
        "Brigitta was highly delighted at this. “It is well worth more\nthan ten shillings!” she said as she held it up for further\nadmiration. “And what a blessing Heidi has brought home with her\nfrom Frankfurt! I have thought sometimes that it might be good\nto send Peter there for a little while; what do you think,\nUncle?”",
        "A merry look came into the grandfather’s eye. He thought it\nwould do Peter no harm, but he had better wait for a good\nopportunity before starting. At this moment the subject of their\nconversation himself rushed in, evidently in a great hurry,\nknocking his head violently against the door in his haste, so\nthat everything in the room rattled. Gasping and breathless he\nstood still after this and held out a letter. This was another\ngreat event, for such a thing had never happened before; the\nletter was addressed to Heidi and had been delivered at the post-\noffice in Dorfli. They all sat down round the table to hear what\nwas in it, for Heidi opened it at once and read it without\nhesitation. The letter was from Clara. The latter wrote that the\nhouse had been so dull since Heidi left that she did not know how\nto bear herself, and she had at last persuaded her father to take\nher to the baths at Ragatz in the coming autumn; grandmamma had\narranged to join them there, and they both were looking forward\nto paying her and her grandfather a visit. And grandmamma sent a\nfurther message to Heidi which was that the latter had done quite\nright to take the rolls to the grandmother, and so that she might\nnot have to eat them dry, she was sending some coffee, which was\nalready on its way, and grandmamma hoped when she came to the\nAlm in the autumn that Heidi would take her to see her old\nfriend.",
        "There were exclamations of pleasure and astonishment on hearing\nall this news, and so much to talk and ask about that even the\ngrandfather did not notice how the time was passing; there was\ngeneral delight at the thought of the coming days, and even more\nat the meeting which had taken place on this one, and the\ngrandmother spoke and said, “The happiest of all things is when\nan old friend comes and greets us as in former times; the heart\nis comforted with the assurance that some day everything that we\nhave loved will be given back to us.–You will come soon again,\nuncle, and you child, to-morrow?”",
        "The old man and Heidi promised her faithfully to do so; then it\nwas time to break up the party, and these two went back up the\nmountain. As they had been greeted with bells when they made\ntheir journey down in the morning, so now they were accompanied\nby the peaceful evening chimes as they climbed to the hut, which\nhad quite a Sunday-like appearance as it stood bathed in the\nlight of the low evening sun.",
        "But when grandmamma comes next autumn there will be many fresh\njoys and surprises both for Heidi and grandmother; without doubt\na proper bed will be put up in the hay-loft, for wherever\ngrandmamma steps in, there everything is soon in right order,\noutside and in.",
        "The kind doctor who had given the order that Heidi was to be\nsent home was walking along one of the broad streets towards Herr\nSesemann’s house. It was a sunny September morning, so full of\nlight and sweetness that it seemed as if everybody must rejoice.\nBut the doctor walked with his eyes fastened to the ground and\ndid not once lift them to the blue sky above him. There was an\nexpression of sadness on his face, formerly so cheerful, and his\nhair had grown greyer since the spring. The doctor had had an\nonly daughter, who, after his wife’s death, had been his sole\nand constant companion, but only a few months previously death\nhad deprived him of his dear child, and he had never been the\nsame bright and cheery man since.",
        "Sebastian opened the door to him, greeting him with every mark\nof respectful civility, for the doctor was not only the most\ncherished friend of the master and his daughter, but had by his\nkindness won the hearts of the whole household.",
        "“Everything as usual, Sebastian?” asked the doctor in his\npleasant voice as he preceded Sebastian up the stairs.",
        "“I am glad you have come, doctor,” exclaimed Herr Sesemann as\nthe latter entered. “We must really have another talk over this\nSwiss journey; do you still adhere to your decision, even though\nClara is decidedly improving in health?”",
        "“My dear Sesemann, I never knew such a man as you!” said the\ndoctor as he sat down beside his friend. “I really wish your\nmother was here; everything would be clear and straightforward\nthen and she would soon put things in right train. You sent for\nme three times yesterday only to ask me the same question,\nthough you know what I think.”",
        "“Yes, I know, it’s enough to make you out of patience with me;\nbut you must understand, dear friend\"–and Herr Sesemann laid\nhis hand imploringly on the doctor’s shoulder–\"that I feel I\nhave not the courage to refuse the child what I have been\npromising her all along, and for months now she has been living\non the thought of it day and night. She bore this last bad attack\nso patiently because she was buoyed up with the hope that she\nshould soon start on her Swiss journey, and see her friend Heidi\nagain; and now must I tell the poor child, who has to give up so\nmany pleasures, that this visit she has so long looked forward to\nmust also be cancelled? I really have not the courage to do it.”",
        "“You must make up your mind to it, Sesemann,” said the doctor\nwith authority, and as his friend continued silent and dejected\nhe went on after a pause, “Consider yourself how the matter\nstands. Clara has not had such a bad summer as this last one for\nyears. Only the worst results would follow from the fatigue of\nsuch a journey, and it is out of the question for her. And then\nwe are already in September, and although it may still be warm\nand fine up there, it may just as likely be already very cold.\nThe days too are growing short, and as Clara cannot spend the\nnight up there she would only have a two hours’ visit at the\noutside. The journey from Ragatz would take hours, for she would\nhave to be carried up the mountain in a chair. In short,\nSesemann, it is impossible. But I will go in with you and talk\nto Clara; she is a reasonable child, and I will tell her what my\nplans are. Next May she shall be taken to the baths and stay\nthere for the cure until it is quite hot weather. Then she can\nbe carried up the mountain from time to time, and when she is\nstronger she will enjoy these excursions far more than she would\nnow. Understand, Sesemann, that if we want to give the child a\nchance of recovery we must use the utmost care and\nwatchfulness.”",
        "Herr Sesemann, who had listened to the doctor in sad and\nsubmissive silence, now suddenly jumped up. “Doctor,” he said,\n\"tell me truly: have you really any hope of her final recovery?”",
        "The doctor shrugged his shoulders. “Very little,” he replied\nquietly. “But, friend, think of my trouble. You have still a\nbeloved child to look for you and greet you on your return home.\nYou do not come back to an empty house and sit down to a\nsolitary meal. And the child is happy and comfortable at home\ntoo. If there is much that she has to give up, she has on the\nother hand many advantages. No, Sesemann, you are not so greatly\nto be pitied–you have still the happiness of being together.\nThink of my lonely house!”",
        "Herr Sesemann was now striding up and down the room as was his\nhabit when deeply engaged in thought. Suddenly he came to a\npause beside his friend and laid his hand on his shoulder.\n\"Doctor, I have an idea; I cannot bear to see you look as you do;\nyou are no longer the same man. You must be taken out of yourself\nfor a while, and what do you think I propose? That you shall take\nthe journey and go and pay Heidi a visit in our name.”",
        "The doctor was taken aback at this sudden proposal and wanted to\nmake objections, but his friend gave him no time to say\nanything. He was so delighted with his idea, that he seized the\ndoctor by the arm and drew him into Clara’s room. The kind doctor\nwas always a welcome visitor to Clara, for he generally had\nsomething amusing to tell her. Lately, it is true, he had been\ngraver, but Clara knew the reason why and would have given much\nto see him his old lively self again. She held out her hand to\nhim as he came up to her; he took a seat beside her, and her\nfather also drew up his chair, and taking Clara’s hand in his\nbegan to talk to her of the Swiss journey and how he himself had\nlooked forward to it. He passed as quickly as he could over the\nmain point that it was now impossible for her to undertake it,\nfor he dreaded the tears that would follow; but he went on\nwithout pause to tell her of his new plan, and dwelt on the great\nbenefit it would be to his friend if he could be persuaded to\ntake this holiday.",
        "The tears were indeed swimming in the blue eyes, although Clara\nstruggled to keep them down for her father’s sake, but it was a\nbitter disappointment to give up the journey, the thought of\nwhich had been her only joy and solace during the lonely hours\nof her long illness. She knew, however, that her father would\nnever refuse her a thing unless he was certain that it would be\nharmful for her. So she swallowed her tears as well as she could\nand turned her thoughts to the one hope still left her. Taking\nthe doctor’s hand and stroking it, she said pleadingly,–",
        "“Dear doctor, you will go and see Heidi, won’t you? and then you\ncan come and tell me all about it, what it is like up there, and\nwhat Heidi and the grandfather, and Peter and the goats do all\nday. I know them all so well! And then you can take what I want\nto send to Heidi; I have thought about it all, and also\nsomething for the grandmother. Do pray go, dear doctor, and I\nwill take as much cod liver oil as you like.”",
        "Whether this promise finally decided the doctor it is impossible\nto say, but it is certain that he smiled and said,–",
        "“Then I must certainly go, Clara, for you will then get as plump\nand strong as your father and I wish to see you. And have you\ndecided when I am to start?”",
        "“To-morrow morning–early if possible,” replied Clara.",
        "“Yes, she is right,” put in Herr Sesemann; “the sun is shining\nand the sky is blue, and there is no time to be lost; it is a\npity to miss a single one of these days on the mountain.”",
        "The doctor could not help laughing. “You will be reproaching me\nnext for not being there already; well, I must go and make\narrangements for getting off.”",
        "But Clara would not let him go until she had given him endless\nmessages for Heidi, and had explained all he was to look at so\nas to give her an exact description on his return. Her presents\nshe would send round later, as Fraulein Rottenmeier must first\nhelp her to pack them up; at that moment she was out on one of\nher excursions into the town which always kept her engaged for\nsome time. The doctor promised to obey Clara’s directions in\nevery particular; he would start some time during the following\nday if not the first thing in the morning, and would bring back a\nfaithful account of his experiences and of all he saw and heard.",
        "The servants of a household have a curious faculty of divining\nwhat is going on before they are actually told about anything.\nSebastian and Tinette must have possessed this faculty in a high\ndegree, for even as the doctor was going downstairs, Tinette,\nwho had been rung for, entered Clara’s room.",
        "“Take that box and bring it back filled with the soft cakes\nwhich we have with coffee,” said Clara, pointing to a box which\nhad been brought long before in preparation for this. Tinette\ntook it up, and carried it out, dangling it contemptuously in her\nhand.",
        "“Hardly worth the trouble I should have thought,” she said\npertly as she left the room.",
        "As Sebastian opened the door for the doctor he said with a bow,\n\"Will the Herr Doctor be so kind as to give the little miss my\ngreetings?”",
        "“I see,” said the doctor, “you know then already that I am off\non a journey.”",
        "Sebastian hesitated and gave an awkward little cough. “I am–I\nhave–I hardly know myself. O yes, I remember; I happened to\npass through the dining-room and caught little miss’s name, and I\nput two and two together–and so I thought–”",
        "“I see, I see,” smiled the doctor, “one can find out a great\nmany thinks by thinking. Good-bye till I see you again,\nSebastian, I will be sure and give your message.”",
        "The doctor was hastening off when he met with a sudden obstacle;\nthe violent wind had prevented Fraulein Rottenmeier prosecuting\nher walk any farther, and she was just returning and had reached\nthe door as he was coming out. The white shawl she wore was so\nblown out by the wind that she looked like a ship in full sail.\nThe doctor drew back, but Fraulein Rottenmeier had always\nevinced peculiar appreciation and respect for this man, and she\nalso drew back with exaggerated politeness to let him pass. The\ntwo stood for a few seconds, each anxious to make way for the\nother, but a sudden gust of wind sent Fraulein Rottenmeier flying\nwith all her sails almost into the doctor’s arms, and she had to\npause and recover herself before she could shake hands with the\ndoctor with becoming decorum. She was put out at having been\nforced to enter in so undignified a manner, but the doctor had a\nway of smoothing people’s ruffled feathers, and she was soon\nlistening with her usual composure while he informed her of his\nintended journey, begging her in his most conciliatory voice to\npack up the parcels for Heidi as she alone knew how to pack. And\nthen he took his leave.",
        "Clara quite expected to have a long tussle with Fraulein\nRottenmeier before she would get the latter to consent to\nsending all the things that she had collected as presents for\nHeidi. But this time she was mistaken, for Fraulein Rottenmeier\nwas in a more than usually good temper. She cleared the large\ntable so that all the things for Heidi could be spread out upon\nit and packed under Clara’s own eyes. It was no light job, for\nthe presents were of all shapes and sizes. First there was the\nlittle warm cloak with a hood, which had been designed by Clara\nherself, in order that Heidi during the coming winter might be\nable to go and see grandmother when she liked, and not have to\nwait till her grandfather could take her wrapped up in a sack to\nkeep her from freezing. Then came a thick warm shawl for the\ngrandmother, in which she could wrap herself well up and not feel\nthe cold when the wind came sweeping in such terrible gusts round\nthe house. The next object was the large box full of cakes; these\nwere also for the grandmother, that she might have something to\neat with her coffee besides bread. An immense sausage was the\nnext article; this had been originally intended for Peter, who\nnever had anything but bread and cheese, but Clara had altered\nher mind, fearing that in his delight he might eat it all up at\nonce and make himself ill. So she arranged to send it to\nBrigitta, who could take some for herself and the grandmother and\ngive Peter his portion out by degrees. A packet of tobacco was a\npresent for grandfather, who was fond of his pipe as he sat\nresting in the evening. Finally there was a whole lot of\nmysterious little bags, and parcels, and boxes, which Clara had\nhad especial pleasure in collecting, as each was to be a joyful\nsurprise for Heidi as she opened it. The work came to an end at\nlast, and an imposing-looking package lay on the floor ready for\ntransport. Fraulein Rottenmeier looked at it with satisfaction,\nlost in the consideration of the art of packing. Clara eyed it\ntoo with pleasure, picturing Heidi’s exclamations and jumps of\njoy and surprise when the huge parcel arrived at the hut.",
        "And now Sebastian came in, and lifting the package on to his\nshoulder, carried it off to be forwarded at once to the doctor’s\nhouse.",
        "The early light of morning lay rosy red upon the mountains, and\na fresh breeze rustled through the fir trees and set their\nancient branches waving to and fro. The sound awoke Heidi and she\nopened her eyes. The roaring in the trees always stirred a strong\nemotion within her and seemed to drew her irresistibly to them.\nSo she jumped out of bed and dressed herself as quickly as she\ncould, but it took her some time even then, for she was careful\nnow to be always clean and tidy.",
        "When she went down her ladder she found her grandfather had\nalready left the hut. He was standing outside looking at the sky\nand examining the landscape as he did every morning, to see what\nsort of weather it was going to be.",
        "Little pink clouds were floating over the sky, that was growing\nbrighter and bluer with every minute, while the heights and the\nmeadow lands were turning gold under the rising sun, which was\njust appearing above the topmost peaks.",
        "“O how beautiful! how beautiful! Good-morning, grandfather!\"\ncried Heidi, running out.",
        "“What, you are awake already, are you?” he answered, giving her\na morning greeting.",
        "Then Heidi ran round to the fir trees to enjoy the sound she\nloved so well, and with every fresh gust of wind which came\nroaring through their branches she gave a fresh jump and cry of\ndelight.",
        "Meanwhile the grandfather had gone to milk the goats; this done\nhe brushed and washed them, ready for their mountain excursion,\nand brought them out of their shed. As soon as Heidi caught\nsight of her two friends she ran and embraced them, and they\nbleated in return, while they vied with each other in showing\ntheir affection by poking their heads against her and trying\nwhich could get nearest her, so that she was almost crushed\nbetween them. But Heidi was not afraid of them, and when the\nlively Little Bear gave rather too violent a thrust, she only\nsaid, “No, Little Bear, you are pushing like the Great Turk,” and\nLittle Bear immediately drew back his head and left off his rough\nattentions, while Little Swan lifted her head and put on an\nexpression as much as to say, “No one shall ever accuse me of\nbehaving like the Great Turk.” For White Swan was a rather more\ndistinguished person than Brown Bear.",
        "And now Peter’s whistle was heard and all the goats came along,\nleaping and springing, and Heidi soon found herself surrounded\nby the whole flock, pushed this way and that by their\nobstreperous greetings, but at last she managed to get through\nthem to where Snowflake was standing, for the young goat had in\nvain striven to reach her.",
        "Peter now gave a last tremendous whistle, in order to startle\nthe goats and drive them off, for he wanted to get near himself\nto say something to Heidi. The goats sprang aside and he came up\nto her.",
        "“Can you come out with me to-day?” he asked, evidently unwilling\nto hear her refuse.",
        "“I am afraid I cannot, Peter,” she answered. “I am expecting\nthem every minute from Frankfurt, and I must be at home when they\ncome.”",
        "“You have said the same thing for days now,” grumbled Peter.",
        "“I must continue to say it till they come,” replied Heidi. “How\ncan you think, Peter, that I would be away when they came? As if\nI could do such a thing?”",
        "“They would find Uncle at home,” he answered with a snarling\nvoice.",
        "But at this moment the grandfather’s stentorian voice was heard.\n\"Why is the army not marching forward? Is it the field-marshal\nwho is missing or some of the troops?”",
        "Whereupon Peter turned and went off, swinging his stick round so\nthat it whistled through the air, and the goats, who understood\nthe signal, started at full trot for their mountain pasture,\nPeter following in their wake.",
        "Since Heidi had been back with her grandfather things came now\nand then into her mind of which she had never thought in former\ndays. So now, with great exertion, she put her bed in order\nevery morning, patting and stroking it till she had got it\nperfectly smooth and flat. Then she went about the room\ndownstairs, put each chair back in its place, and if she found\nanything lying about she put it in the cupboard. After that she\nfetched a duster, climbed on a chair, and rubbed the table till\nit shone again. When the grandfather came in later he would look\nround well pleased and say to himself, “We look like Sunday every\nday now; Heidi did not go abroad for nothing.”",
        "After Peter had departed and she and her grandfather had\nbreakfasted, Heidi began her daily work as usual, but she did\nnot get on with it very fast. It was so lovely out of doors to-\nday, and every minute something happened to interrupt her in her\nwork. Now it was a bright beam of sun shining cheerfully through\nthe open window, and seeming to say, “Come out, Heidi, come out!\"\nHeidi felt she could not stay indoors, and she ran out in answer\nto the call. The sunlight lay sparkling on everything around the\nhut and on all the mountains and far away along the valley, and\nthe grass slope looked so golden and inviting that she was\nobliged to sit down for a few minutes and look about her. Then\nshe suddenly remembered that her stool was left standing in the\nmiddle of the floor and that the table had not been rubbed, and\nshe jumped up and ran inside again. But it was not long before\nthe fir trees began their old song; Heidi felt it in all her\nlimbs, and again the desire to run outside was irresistible, and\nshe was off to play and leap to the tune of the waving branches.\nThe grandfather, who was busy in his work-shed, stepped out from\ntime to time smiling to watch her at her gambols. He had just\ngone back to his work on one of these occasions when Heidi\ncalled out, “Grandfather! grandfather! Come, come!”",
        "He stepped quickly out, almost afraid something had happened to\nthe child, but he saw her running towards where the mountain\npath descended, crying, “They are coming! they are coming! and\nthe doctor is in front of them!”",
        "Heidi rushed forward to welcome her old friend, who held out his\nhands in greeting to her. When she came up to him she clung to\nhis outstretched arm, and exclaimed in the joy of her heart,\n\"Good-morning, doctor, and thank you ever so many times.”",
        "“God bless you, child! what have you got to thank me for?” asked\nthe doctor, smiling.",
        "“For being at home again with grandfather,” the child explained.",
        "The doctor’s face brightened as if a sudden ray of sunshine had\npassed across it; he had not expected such a reception as this.\nLost in the sense of his loneliness he had climbed the mountain\nwithout heeding how beautiful it was on every side, and how more\nand more beautiful it became the higher he got. He had quite\nthought that Heidi would have forgotten him; she had seen so\nlittle of him, and he had felt rather like one bearing a message\nof disappointment, anticipating no great show of favor, coming\nas he did without the expected friends. But instead, here was\nHeidi, her eyes dancing for joy, and full of gratitude and\naffection, clinging to the arm of her kind friend.",
        "He took her by the hand with fatherly tenderness.",
        "“Take me now to your grandfather, Heidi, and show me where you\nlive.”",
        "But Heidi still remained standing, looking down the path with a\nquestioning gaze. “Where are Clara and grandmother?” she asked.",
        "“Ah, now I have to tell you something which you will be as sorry\nabout as I am,” answered the doctor. “You see, Heidi, I have\ncome alone. Clara was very ill and could not travel, and so the\ngrandmother stayed behind too. But next spring, when the days\ngrow warm and long again, they are coming here for certain.”",
        "Heidi was greatly concerned; she could not at first bring\nherself to believe that what she had for so long been picturing\nto herself was not going to happen after all. She stood\nmotionless for a second or two, overcome by the unexpected\ndisappointment. The doctor said nothing further; all around lay\nthe silence, only the sighing of the fir trees could be heard\nfrom where they stood. Then Heidi suddenly remembered why she had\nrun down there, and that the doctor had really come. She lifted\nher eyes and saw the sad expression in his as he looked down at\nher; she had never seen him with that look on his face when she\nwas in Frankfurt. It went to Heidi’s heart; she could not bear to\nsee anybody unhappy, especially her dear doctor. No doubt it was\nbecause Clara and grandmother could not come, and so she began to\nthink how best she might console him.",
        "“Oh, it won’t be very long to wait for spring, and then they\nwill be sure to come,” she said in a reassuring voice. “Time\npasses very quickly with us, and then they will be able to stay\nlonger when they are here, and Clara will be pleased at that. Now\nlet us go and find grandfather.”",
        "Hand in hand with her friend she climbed up to the hut. She was\nso anxious to make the doctor happy again that she began once\nmore assuring him that the winter passed so quickly on the\nmountain that it was hardly to be taken account of, and that\nsummer would be back again before they knew it, and she became\nso convinced of the truth of her own words that she called out\nquite cheerfully to her grandfather as they approached, “They\nhave not come to-day, but they will be here in a very short\ntime.”",
        "The doctor was no stranger to the grandfather, for the child had\ntalked to him so much about her friend. The old man held out his\nhand to his guest in friendly greeting. Then the two men sat\ndown in front of the hut, and Heidi had her little place too, for\nthe doctor beckoned her to come and sit beside him. The doctor\ntold Uncle how Herr Sesemann had insisted on his taking this\njourney, and he felt himself it would do him good as he had not\nbeen quite the thing for a long time. Then he whispered to Heidi\nthat there was something being brought up the mountain which had\ntravelled with him from Frankfurt, and which would give her even\nmore pleasure than seeing the old doctor. Heidi got into a great\nstate of excitement on hearing this, wondering what it could be,\nThe old man urged the doctor to spend as many of the beautiful\nautumn days on the mountain as he could, and at least to come up\nwhenever it was fine; he could not offer him a lodging, as he had\nno place to put him; he advised the doctor, however, not to go\nback to Ragatz, but to stay at Dorfli, where there was a clean\ntidy little inn. Then the doctor could come up every morning,\nwhich would do him no end of good, and if he liked, he, the\ngrandfather, would act as his guide to any part of the mountains\nhe would like to see. The doctor was delighted with this\nproposal, and it was settled that it should be as the\ngrandfather suggested.",
        "Meanwhile the sun had been climbing up the sky, and it was now\nnoon. The wind had sunk and the fir trees stood motionless. The\nair was still wonderfully warm and mild for that height, while a\ndelicious freshness was mingled with the warmth of the sun.",
        "Alm-Uncle now rose and went indoors, returning in a few minutes\nwith a table which he placed in front of the seat.",
        "“There, Heidi, now run in and bring us what we want for the\ntable,” he said. “The doctor must take us as he finds us; if the\nfood is plain, he will acknowledge that the dining-room is\npleasant.”",
        "“I should think so indeed,” replied the doctor as he looked down\nover the sun-lit valley, “and I accept the kind invitation;\neverything must taste good up here.”",
        "Heidi ran backwards and forwards as busy as a bee and brought\nout everything she could find in the cupboard, for she did not\nknow how to be pleased enough that she could help to entertain\nthe doctor. The grandfather meanwhile had been preparing the\nmeal, and now appeared with a steaming jug of milk and golden-\nbrown toasted cheese. Then he cut some thin slices from the meat\nhe had cured himself in the pure air, and the doctor enjoyed his\ndinner better than he had for a whole year past.",
        "“Our Clara must certainly come up here,” he said, “it would make\nher quite a different person, and if she ate for any length of\ntime as I have to-day, she would grow plumper than any one has\never known her before.”",
        "As he spoke a man was seen coming up the path carrying a large\npackage on his back. When he reached the hut he threw it on the\nground and drew in two or three good breaths of the mountain\nair.",
        "“Ah, here’s what travelled with me from Frankfurt,” said the\ndoctor, rising, and he went up to the package and began undoing\nit, Heidi looking on in great expectation. After he had released\nit from its heavy outer covering, “There, child,” he said, “now\nyou can go on unpacking your treasures yourself.”",
        "Heidi undid her presents one by one until they were all\ndisplayed; she could not speak the while for wonder and delight.\nNot till the doctor went up to her again and opened the large\nbox to show Heidi the cakes that were for the grandmother to eat\nwith her coffee, did she at last give a cry of joy, exclaiming,\n\"Now grandmother will have nice things to eat,” and she wanted to\npack everything up again and start at once to give them to her.\nBut the grandfather said he should walk down with the doctor that\nevening and she could go with them and take the things. Heidi\nnow found the packet of tobacco which she ran and gave to her\ngrandfather; he was so pleased with it that he immediately\nfilled his pipe with some, and the two men then sat down together\nagain, the smoke curling up from their pipes as they talked of\nall kinds of things, while Heidi continued to examine first one\nand then another of her presents. Suddenly she ran up to them,\nand standing in front of the doctor waited till there was a pause\nin the conversation, and then said, “No, the other thing has not\ngiven me more pleasure than seeing you, doctor.”",
        "The two men could not help laughing, and the doctor answered\nthat he should never have thought it.",
        "As the sun began to sink behind the mountains the doctor rose,\nthinking it was time to return to Dorfli and seek for quarters.\nThe grandfather carried the cakes and the shawl and the large\nsausage, and the doctor took Heidi’s hand, so they all three\nstarted down the mountain. Arrived at Peter’s home Heidi bid the\nothers good-bye; she was to wait at grandmother’s till her\ngrandfather, who was going on to Dorfli with his guest, returned\nto fetch her. As the doctor shook hands with her she asked,\n\"Would you like to come out with the goats to-morrow morning?\"\nfor she could think of no greater treat to offer him.",
        "“Agreed!” answered the doctor, “we will go together,”",
        "Heidi now ran in to the grandmother; she first, with some\neffort, managed to carry in the box of cakes; then she ran out\nagain and brought in the sausage–for her grandfather had put the\npresents down by the door–and then a third time for the shawl.\nShe had placed them as close as she could to the grandmother, so\nthat the latter might be able to feel them and understand what\nwas there. The shawl she laid over the old woman’s knees.",
        "“They are all from Frankfurt, from Clara and grandmamma,” she\nexplained to the astonished grandmother and Brigitta, the latter\nhaving watched her dragging in all the heavy things, unable to\nimagine what was happening.",
        "“And you are very pleased with the cakes, aren’t you,\ngrandmother? taste how soft they are!” said Heidi over and over\nagain, to which the grandmother continued to answer, “Yes, yes,\nHeidi, I should think so! what kind people they must be!” And\nthen she would pass her hand over the warm thick shawl and add,\n\"This will be beautiful for the cold winter! I never thought I\nshould ever have such a splendid thing as this to put on.”",
        "Heidi could not help feeling some surprise at the grandmother\nseeming to take more pleasure in the shawl than the cakes.\nMeanwhile Brigitta stood gazing at the sausage with almost an\nexpression of awe. She had hardly in her life seen such a\nmonster sausage, much less owned one, and she could scarcely\nbelieve her eyes. She shook her head and said doubtfully, “I must\nask Uncle what it is meant for,”",
        "But Heidi answered without hesitation, “It is meant for eating,\nnot for anything else.”",
        "Peter came tumbling in at this minute. “Uncle is just behind me,\nhe is coming–” he began, and then stopped short, for his eye\nhad caught sight of the sausage, and he was too much taken aback\nto say more. But Heidi understood that her grandfather was near\nand so said good-bye to grandmother. The old man now never passed\nthe door without going in to wish the old woman good-day, and she\nliked to hear his footstep approaching, for he always had a\ncheery word for her. But to-day it was growing late for Heidi,\nwho was always up with the lark, and the grandfather would never\nlet her go to bed after hours; so this evening he only called\ngood-night through the open door and started home at once with\nthe child, and the two climbed under the starlit sky back to\ntheir peaceful dwelling.",
        "The next morning the doctor climbed up from Dorfli with Peter\nand the goats. The kindly gentleman tried now and then to enter\ninto conversation with the boy, but his attempts failed, for he\ncould hardly get a word out of Peter in answer to his questions.\nPeter was not easily persuaded to talk. So the party silently\nmade their way up to the hut, where they found Heidi awaiting\nthem with her two goats, all three as fresh and lively as the\nmorning sun among the mountains.",
        "“Are you coming to-day?” said Peter, repeating the words with\nwhich he daily greeted her, either in question or in summons.",
        "“Of course I am, if the doctor is coming too,” replied Heidi.",
        "Peter cast a sidelong glance at the doctor. The grandfather now\ncame out with the dinner bag, and after bidding good-day to the\ndoctor he went up to Peter and slung it over his neck. It was\nheavier than usual, for Alm-Uncle had added some meat to-day, as\nhe thought the doctor might like to have his lunch out and eat\nit when the children did. Peter gave a grin, for he felt sure\nthere was something more than ordinary in it.",
        "And so the ascent began. The goats as usual came thronging\naround Heidi, each trying to be nearest her, until at last she\nstood still and said, “Now you must go on in front and behave\nproperly, and not keep on turning back and pushing and poking me,\nfor I want to talk to the doctor,” and she gave Snowflake a\nlittle pat on the back and told her to be good and obedient. By\ndegrees she managed to make her way out from among them and\njoined the doctor, who took her by the hand. He had no difficulty\nnow in conversing with his companion, for Heidi had a great deal\nto say about the goats and their peculiarities, and about the\nflowers and the rocks and the birds, and so they clambered on and\nreached their resting-place before they were aware. Peter had\nsent a good many unfriendly glances towards the doctor on the way\nup, which might have quite alarmed the latter if he had happened\nto notice them, which, fortunately, he did not.",
        "Heidi now led her friend to her favorite spot where she was\naccustomed to sit and enjoy the beauty around her; the doctor\nfollowed her example and took his seat beside her on the warm\ngrass. Over the heights and over the far green valley hung the\ngolden glory of the autumn day. The great snow-field sparkled in\nthe bright sunlight, and the two grey rocky peaks rose in their\nancient majesty against the dark blue sky. A soft, light morning\nbreeze blew deliciously across the mountain, gently stirring the\nbluebells that still remained of the summer’s wealth of flowers,\ntheir slender heads nodding cheerfully in the sunshine. Overhead\nthe great bird was flying round and round in wide circles, but to-\nday he made no sound; poised on his large wings he floated\ncontentedly in the blue ether. Heidi looked about her first at\none thing and then at another. The waving flowers, the blue sky,\nthe bright sunshine, the happy bird–everything was so\nbeautiful! so beautiful! Her eyes were alight with joy. And now\nshe turned to her friend to see if he too were enjoying the\nbeauty. The doctor had been sitting thoughtfully gazing around\nhim. As he met her glad bright eyes, “Yes, Heidi,” he responded,\n\"I see how lovely it all is, but tell me–if one brings a sad\nheart up here, how may it be healed so that it can rejoice in all\nthis beauty?”",
        "“Oh, but,” exclaimed Heidi, “no one is sad up here, only in\nFrankfurt.”",
        "The doctor smiled and then growing serious again he continued,\n\"But supposing one is not able to leave all the sadness behind\nat Frankfurt; can you tell me anything that will help then?”",
        "“When you do not know what more to do you must go and tell\neverything to God,” answered Heidi with decision.",
        "“Ah, that is a good thought of yours, Heidi,” said the doctor.\n\"But if it is God Himself who has sent the trouble, what can we\nsay to Him then?”",
        "Heidi sat pondering for a while; she was sure in her heart that\nGod could help out of every trouble. She thought over her own\nexperiences and then found her answer.",
        "“Then you must wait,” she said, “and keep on saying to yourself:\nGod certainly knows of some happiness for us which He is going\nto bring out of the trouble, only we must have patience and not\nrun away. And then all at once something happens and we see\nclearly ourselves that God has had some good thought in His mind\nall along; but because we cannot see things beforehand, and only\nknow how dreadfully miserable we are, we think it is always going\nto be so.”",
        "“That is a beautiful faith, child, and be sure you hold it\nfast,” replied the doctor. Then he sat on a while in silence,\nlooking at the great overshadowing mountains and the green,\nsunlit valley below before he spoke again,–",
        "“Can you understand, Heidi, that a man may sit here with such a\nshadow over his eyes that he cannot feel and enjoy the beauty\naround him, while the heart grows doubly sad knowing how\nbeautiful it could be? Can you understand that?”",
        "A pain shot through the child’s young happy heart. The shadow\nover the eyes brought to her remembrance the grandmother, who\nwould never again be able to see the sunlight and the beauty up\nhere. This was Heidi’s great sorrow, which re-awoke each time\nshe thought about the darkness. She did not speak for a few\nminutes, for her happiness was interrupted by this sudden pang.\nThen in a grave voice she said,–",
        "“Yes, I can understand it. And I know this, that then one must\nsay one of grandmother’s hymns, which bring the light back a\nlittle, and often make it so bright for her that she is quite\nhappy again. Grandmother herself told me this.”",
        "“Which hymns are they, Heidi?” asked the doctor.",
        "“I only know the one about the sun and the beautiful garden, and\nsome of the verses of the long one, which are favorites with\nher, and she always likes me to read them to her two or three\ntimes over,” replied Heidi.",
        "“Well, say the verses to me then, I should like to hear them\ntoo,” and the doctor sat up in order to listen better.",
        "Heidi put her hands together and sat collecting her thoughts for\na second or two: “Shall I begin at the verse that grandmother\nsays gives her a feeling of hope and confidence?”",
        "The doctor nodded his assent, and Heidi began,–",
        "    Let not your heart be troubled  \n    Nor fear your soul dismay,\n    There is a wise Defender\n    And He will be your stay.\n    Where you have failed, He conquers,\n    See, how the foeman flies!\n    And all your tribulation  \n    Is turned to glad surprise.",
        "    If for a while it seemeth\n    His mercy is withdrawn,\n    That He no longer careth\n    For His wandering child forlorn,\n    Doubt not His great compassion,\n    His love can never tire,\n    To those who wait in patience\n    He gives their heart’s desire.",
        "Heidi suddenly paused; she was not sure if the doctor was still\nlistening. He was sitting motionless with his hand before his\neyes. She thought he had fallen asleep; when he awoke, if he\nwanted to hear more verses, she would go on. There was no sound\nanywhere. The doctor sat in silence, but he was certainly not\nasleep. His thoughts had carried him back to a long past time:\nhe saw himself as a little boy standing by his dear mother’s\nchair; she had her arm round his neck and was saying the very\nverses to him that Heidi had just recited–words which he had not\nheard now for years. He could hear his mother’s voice and see her\nloving eyes resting upon him, and as Heidi ceased the old dear\nvoice seemed to be saying other things to him; and the words he\nheard again must have carried him far, far away, for it was a\nlong time before he stirred or took his hand from his eyes. When\nat last he roused himself he met Heidi’s eyes looking wonderingly\nat him.",
        "“Heidi,” he said, taking the child’s hand in his, “that was a\nbeautiful hymn of yours,” and there was a happier ring in his\nvoice as he spoke. “We will come out here together another day,\nand you will let me hear it again.”",
        "Peter meanwhile had had enough to do in giving vent to his\nanger. It was now some days since Heidi had been out with him,\nand when at last she did come, there she sat the whole time\nbeside the old gentleman, and Peter could not get a word with\nher. He got into a terrible temper, and at last went and stood\nsome way back behind the doctor, where the latter could not see\nhim, and doubling his fist made imaginary hits at the enemy.\nPresently he doubled both fists, and the longer Heidi stayed\nbeside the gentleman, the more fiercely did he threaten with\nthem.",
        "Meanwhile the sun had risen to the height which Peter knew\npointed to the dinner hour. All of a sudden he called at the top\nof his voice, “It’s dinner time.”",
        "Heidi was rising to fetch the dinner bag so that the doctor\nmight eat his where he sat. But he stopped her, telling her he\nwas not hungry at all, and only cared for a glass of milk, as he\nwanted to climb up a little higher. Then Heidi found that she\nalso was not hungry and only wanted milk, and she should like,\nshe said, to take the doctor up to the large moss-covered rock\nwhere Greenfinch had nearly jumped down and killed herself. So\nshe ran and explained matters to Peter, telling him to go and get\nmilk for the two. Peter seemed hardly to understand. “Who is\ngoing to eat what is in the bag then?” he asked.",
        "“You can have it,” she answered, “only first make haste and get\nthe milk.”",
        "Peter had seldom performed any task more promptly, for he\nthought of the bag and its contents, which now belonged to him.\nAs soon as the other two were sitting quietly drinking their\nmilk, he opened it, and quite trembled for joy at the sight of\nthe meat, and he was just putting his hand in to draw it out when\nsomething seemed to hold him back. His conscience smote him at\nthe remembrance of how he had stood with his doubled fists behind\nthe doctor, who was now giving up to him his whole good dinner.\nHe felt as if he could not now enjoy it. But all at once he\njumped up and ran back to the spot where he had stood before, and\nthere held up his open hands as a sign that he had no longer any\nwish to use them as fists, and kept them up until he felt he had\nmade amends for his past conduct. Then he rushed back and sat\ndown to the double enjoyment of a clear conscience and an\nunusually satisfying meal.",
        "Heidi and the doctor climbed and talked for a long while, until\nthe latter said it was time for him to be going back, and no\ndoubt Heidi would like to go and be with her goats. But Heidi\nwould not hear of this, as then the doctor would have to go the\nwhole way down the mountain alone. She insisted on accompanying\nhim as far as the grandfather’s hut, or even a little further.\nShe kept hold of her friend’s hand all the time, and the whole\nway she entertained him with accounts of this thing and that,\nshowing him the spots where the goats loved best to feed, and\nothers where in summer the flowers of all colors grew in\ngreatest abundance. She could give them all their right names,\nfor her grandfather had taught her these during the summer\nmonths. But at last the doctor insisted on her going back; so\nthey bid each other good-night and the doctor continued his\ndescent, turning now and again to look back, and each time he saw\nHeidi standing on the same spot and waving her hand to him. Even\nso in the old days had his own dear little daughter watched him\nwhen he went from home.",
        "It was a bright sunny autumn month. The doctor came up to the\nhut every morning, and thence made excursions over the mountain.\nAlm-Uncle accompanied him on some of his higher ascents, when\nthey climbed up to the ancient storm-beaten fir trees and often\ndisturbed the great bird which rose startled from its nest, with\nthe whirl of wings and croakings, very near their heads. The\ndoctor found great pleasure in his companion’s conversation, and\nwas astonished at his knowledge of the plants that grew on the\nmountain: he knew the uses of them all, from the aromatic fir\ntrees and the dark pines with their scented needles, to the\ncurly moss that sprang up everywhere about the roots of the trees\nand the smallest plant and tiniest flower. He was as well versed\nalso in the ways of the animals, great and small, and had many\namusing anecdotes to tell of these dwellers in caves and holes\nand in the tops of the fir trees. And so the time passed\npleasantly and quickly for the doctor, who seldom said good-bye\nto the old man at the end of the day without adding, “I never\nleave you, friend, without having learnt something new from you.”",
        "On some of the very finest days, however, the doctor would\nwander out again with Heidi, and then the two would sit together\nas on the first day, and the child would repeat her hymns and\ntell the doctor things which she alone knew. Peter sat at a\nlittle distance from them, but he was now quite reconciled in\nspirit and gave vent to no angry pantomime.",
        "September had drawn to its close, and now one morning the doctor\nappeared looking less cheerful than usual. It was his last day,\nhe said, as he must return to Frankfurt, but he was grieved at\nhaving to say good-bye to the mountain, which he had begun to\nfeel quite like home. Alm-Uncle, on his side, greatly regretted\nthe departure of his guest, and Heidi had been now accustomed\nfor so long to see her good friend every day that she could\nhardly believe the time had suddenly come to separate. She looked\nup at him in doubt, taken by surprise, but there was no help, he\nmust go. So he bid farewell to the old man and asked that Heidi\nmight go with him part of the return way, and Heidi took his hand\nand went down the mountain with him, still unable to grasp the\nidea that he was going for good. After some distance the doctor\nstood still, and passing his hand over the child’s curly head\nsaid, “Now, Heidi, you must go back, and I must say good-bye! If\nonly I could take you with me to Frankfurt and keep you there!”",
        "The picture of Frankfurt rose before the child’s eyes, its rows\nof endless houses, its hard streets, and even the vision of\nFraulein Rottenmeier and Tinette, and she answered hesitatingly,\n\"I would rather that you came back to us.”",
        "“Yes, you are right, that would be better. But now good-bye,\nHeidi.” The child put her hand in his and looked up at him; the\nkind eyes looking down on her had tears in them. Then the doctor\ntore himself away and quickly continued his descent.",
        "Heidi remained standing without moving. The friendly eyes with\nthe tears in them had gone to her heart. All at once she burst\ninto tears and started running as fast as she could after the\ndeparting figure, calling out in broken tones: “Doctor! doctor!”",
        "He turned round and waited till the child reached him. The tears\nwere streaming down her face and she sobbed out: “I will come to\nFrankfurt with you, now at once, and I will stay with you as\nlong as you like, only I must just run back and tell\ngrandfather.”",
        "The doctor laid his hand on her and tried to calm her\nexcitement. “No, no, dear child,” he said kindly, “not now; you\nmust stay for the present under the fir trees, or I should have\nyou ill again. But hear now what I have to ask you. If I am ever\nill and alone, will you come then and stay with me? May I know\nthat there would then be some one to look after me and care for\nme?”",
        "“Yes, yes, I will come the very day you send for me, and I love\nyou nearly as much as grandfather,” replied Heidi, who had not\nyet got over her distress.",
        "And so the doctor again bid her good-bye and started on his way,\nwhile Heidi remained looking after him and waving her hand as\nlong as a speck of him could be seen. As the doctor turned for\nthe last time and looked back at the waving Heidi and the sunny\nmountain, he said to himself, “It is good to be up there, good\nfor body and soul, and a man might learn how to be happy once\nmore.”",
        "The snow was lying so high around the hut that the windows\nlooked level with the ground, and the door had entirely\ndisappeared from view. If Alm-Uncle had been up there he would\nhave had to do what Peter did daily, for fresh snow fell every\nnight. Peter had to get out of the window of the sitting-room\nevery morning, and if the frost had not been very hard during the\nnight, he immediately sank up to his shoulders almost in the snow\nand had to struggle with hands, feet, and head to extricate\nhimself. Then his mother handed him the large broom, and with\nthis he worked hard to make a way to the door. He had to be\ncareful to dig the snow well away, or else as soon as the door\nwas opened the whole soft mass would fall inside, or, if the\nfrost was severe enough, it would have made such a wall of ice in\nfront of the house that no one could have gone in or out, for the\nwindow was only big enough for Peter to creep through. The fresh\nsnow froze like this in the night sometimes, and this was an\nenjoyable time for Peter, for he would get through the window on\nto the hard, smooth, frozen ground, and his mother would hand him\nout the little sleigh, and he could then make his descent to\nDorfli along any route he chose, for the whole mountain was\nnothing but one wide, unbroken sleigh road.",
        "Alm-Uncle had kept his word and was not spending the winter in\nhis old home. As soon as the first snow began to fall, he had\nshut up the hut and the outside buildings and gone down to\nDorfli with Heidi and the goats. Near the church was a straggling\nhalf-ruined building, which had once been the house of a person\nof consequence. A distinguished soldier had lived there at one\ntime; he had taken service in Spain and had there performed many\nbrave deeds and gathered much treasure. When he returned home to\nDorfli he spent part of his booty in building a fine house, with\nthe intention of living in it. But he had been too long\naccustomed to the noise and bustle of arms and the world to care\nfor a quiet country life, and he soon went off again, and this\ntime did not return. When after many long years it seemed\ncertain that he was dead, a distant relative took possession of\nthe house, but it had already fallen into disrepair, and he had\nno wish to rebuild it. So it was let to poor people, who paid but\na small rent, and when any part of the building fell it was\nallowed to remain. This had now gone on for many years. As long\nago as when his son Tobias was a child Alm-Uncle had rented the\ntumble- down old place. Since then it had stood empty, for no one\ncould stay in it who had not some idea of how to stop up the\nholes and gaps and make it habitable. Otherwise the wind and rain\nand snow blew into the rooms, so that it was impossible even to\nkeep a candle alight, and the indwellers would have been frozen\nto death during the long cold winters. Alm-Uncle, however, knew\nhow to mend matters. As soon as he made up his mind to spend the\nwinter in Dorfli, he rented the old place and worked during the\nautumn to get it sound and tight. In the middle of October he and\nHeidi took up their residence there.",
        "On approaching the house from the back one came first into an\nopen space with a wall on either side, of which one was half in\nruins. Above this rose the arch of an old window thickly\novergrown with ivy, which spread over the remains of a domed\nroof that had evidently been part of a chapel. A large hall came\nnext, which lay open, without doors, to the square outside. Here\nalso walls and roof only partially remained, and indeed what was\nleft of the roof looked as if it might fall at any minute had it\nnot been for two stout pillars that supported it. Alm-Uncle had\nhere put up a wooden partition and covered the floor with straw,\nfor this was to be the goats’ house. Endless passages led from\nthis, through the rents of which the sky as well as the fields\nand the road outside could be seen at intervals; but at last one\ncame to a stout oak door that led into a room that still stood\nintact. Here the walls and the dark wainscoting remained as good\nas ever, and in the corner was an immense stove reaching nearly\nto the ceiling, on the white tiles of which were painted large\npictures in blue. These represented old castles surrounded with\ntrees, and huntsmen riding out with their hounds; or else a quiet\nlake scene, with broad oak trees and a man fishing. A seat ran\nall round the stove so that one could sit at one’s ease and study\nthe pictures. These attracted Heidi’s attention at once, and she\nhad no sooner arrived with her grandfather than she ran and\nseated herself and began to examine them. But when she had\ngradually worked herself round to the back, something else\ndiverted her attention. In the large space between the stove and\nthe wall four planks had been put together as if to make a large\nreceptacle for apples; there were no apples, however, inside, but\nsomething Heidi had no difficulty in recognising, for it was her\nvery own bed, with its hay mattress and sheets, and sack for a\ncoverlid, just as she had it up at the hut. Heidi clapped her\nhands for joy and exclaimed, “O grandfather, this is my room, how\nnice! But where are you going to sleep?”",
        "“Your room must be near the stove or you will freeze,” he\nreplied, “but you can come and see mine too.”",
        "Heidi got down and skipped across the large room after her\ngrandfather, who opened a door at the farther end leading into a\nsmaller one which was to be his bedroom. Then came another door.\nHeidi pushed it open and stood amazed, for here was an immense\nroom like a kitchen, larger than anything of the kind that Heidi\nhad seen before. There was still plenty of work for the\ngrandfather before this room could be finished, for there were\nholes and cracks in the walls through which the wind whistled,\nand yet he had already nailed up so many new planks that it\nlooked as if a lot of small cupboards had been set up round the\nroom. He had, however, made the large old door safe with many\nscrews and nails, as a protection against the outside air, and\nthis was very necessary, for just beyond was a mass of ruined\nbuildings overgrown with tall weeds, which made a dwelling-place\nfor endless beetles and lizards.",
        "Heidi was very delighted with her new home, and by the morning\nafter their arrival she knew every nook and corner so thoroughly\nthat she could take Peter over it and show him all that was to\nbe seen; indeed she would not let him go till he had examined\nevery single wonderful thing contained in it.",
        "Heidi slept soundly in her corner by the stove; but every\nmorning when she first awoke she still thought she was on the\nmountain, and that she must run outside at once to see if the fir\ntrees were so quiet because their branches were weighed down with\nthe thick snow. She had to look about her for some minutes before\nshe felt quite sure where she was, and a certain sensation of\ntrouble and oppression would come over her as she grew aware that\nshe was not at home in the hut. But then she would hear her\ngrandfather’s voice outside, attending to the goats, and these\nwould give one or two loud bleats, as if calling to her to make\nhaste and go to them, and then Heidi was happy again, for she\nknew she was still at home, and she would jump gladly out of bed\nand run out to the animals as quickly as she could. On the fourth\nmorning, as soon as she saw her grandfather, she said, “I must go\nup to see grandmother to-day; she ought not to be alone so long.”",
        "But the grandfather would not agree to this. “Neither to-day nor\nto-morrow can you go,” he said; “the mountain is covered fathom-\ndeep in snow, and the snow is still falling; the sturdy Peter can\nhardly get along. A little creature like you would soon be\nsmothered by it, and we should not be able to find you again.\nWait a bit till it freezes, then you will be able to walk over\nthe hard snow.”",
        "Heidi did not like the thought of having to wait, but the days\nwere so busy that she hardly knew how they went by.",
        "Heidi now went to school in Dorfli every morning and afternoon,\nand eagerly set to work to learn all that was taught her. She\nhardly ever saw Peter there, for as a rule he was absent. The\nteacher was an easy-going man who merely remarked now and then,\n\"Peter is not turning up to-day again, it seems, but there is a\nlot of snow up on the mountain and I daresay he cannot get\nalong.” Peter, however, always seemed able to make his way\nthrough the snow in the evening when school was over, and he\nthen generally paid Heidi a visit.",
        "At last, after some days, the sun again appeared and shone\nbrightly over the white ground, but he went to bed again behind\nthe mountains at a very early hour, as if he did not find such\npleasure in looking down on the earth as when everything was\ngreen and flowery. But then the moon came out clear and large\nand lit up the great white snowfield all through the night, and\nthe next morning the whole mountain glistened and sparkled like a\nhuge crystal. When Peter got out of his window as usual, he was\ntaken by surprise, for instead of sinking into the soft snow he\nfell on the hard ground and went sliding some way down the\nmountain side like a sleigh before he could stop himself. He\npicked himself up and tested the hardness of the ground by\nstamping on it and trying with all his might to dig his heels\ninto it, but even then he could not break off a single little\nsplinter of ice; the Alm was frozen hard as iron. This was just\nwhat Peter had been hoping for, as he knew now that Heidi would\nbe able to come up to them. He quickly got back into the house,\nswallowed the milk which his mother had put ready for him,\nthrust a piece of bread in his pocket, and said, “I must be off\nto school.” “That’s right, go and learn all you can,” said the\ngrandmother encouragingly. Peter crept through the window again–\nthe door was quite blocked by the frozen snow outside–pulling\nhis little sleigh after him, and in another minute was shooting\ndown the mountain.",
        "He went like lightning, and when he reached Dorfli, which stood\non the direct road to Mayenfeld, he made up his mind to go on\nfurther, for he was sure he could not stop his rapid descent\nwithout hurting himself and the sleigh too. So down he still\nwent till he reached the level ground, where the sleigh came to a\npause of its own accord. Then he got out and looked round. The\nimpetus with which he had made his journey down had carried him\nsome little way beyond Mayenfeld. He bethought himself that it\nwas too late to get to school now, as lessons would already have\nbegun, and it would take him a good hour to walk back to Dorfli.\nSo he might take his time about returning, which he did, and\nreached Dorfli just as Heidi had got home from school and was\nsitting at dinner with her grandfather. Peter walked in, and as\non this occasion he had something particular to communicate, he\nbegan without a pause, exclaiming as he stood still in the\nmiddle of the room, “She’s got it now.”",
        "“Got it? what?” asked the Uncle. “Your words sound quite\nwarlike, general.”",
        "“The frost,” explained Peter.",
        "“Oh! then now I can go and see grandmother!” said Heidi\njoyfully, for she had understood Peter’s words at once. “But why\nwere you not at school then? You could have come down in the\nsleigh,” she added reproachfully, for it did not agree with\nHeidi’s ideas of good behavior to stay away when it was possible\nto be there.",
        "“It carried me on too far and I was too late,” Peter replied.",
        "“I call that being a deserter,” said the Uncle, “and deserters\nget their ears pulled, as you know.”",
        "Peter gave a tug to his cap in alarm, for there was no one of\nwhom he stood in so much awe as Alm-Uncle.",
        "“And an army leader like yourself ought to be doubly ashamed of\nrunning away,” continued Alm-Uncle. “What would you think of\nyour goats if one went off this way and another that, and refused\nto follow and do what was good for them? What would you do then?”",
        "“I should beat them,” said Peter promptly.",
        "“And if a boy behaved like these unruly goats, and he got a\nbeating for it, what would you say then?”",
        "“Serve him right,” was the answer.",
        "“Good, then understand this: next time you let your sleigh carry\nyou past the school when you ought to be inside at your lessons,\ncome on to me afterwards and receive what you deserve.”",
        "Peter now understood the drift of the old man’s questions and\nthat he was the boy who behaved like the unruly goats, and he\nlooked somewhat fearfully towards the corner to see if anything\nhappened to be there such as he used himself on such occasions\nfor the punishment of his animals.",
        "But now the grandfather suddenly said in a cheerful voice, “Come\nand sit down and have something, and afterwards Heidi shall go\nwith you. Bring her back this evening and you will find supper\nwaiting for you here.”",
        "This unexpected turn of conversation set Peter grinning all over\nwith delight. He obeyed without hesitation and took his seat\nbeside Heidi. But the child could not eat any more in her\nexcitement at the thought of going to see grandmother. She\npushed the potatoes and toasted cheese which still stood on her\nplate towards him while Uncle was filling his plate from the\nother side, so that he had quite a pile of food in front of him,\nbut he attacked it without any lack of courage. Heidi ran to the\ncupboard and brought out the warm cloak Clara had sent her; with\nthis on and the hood drawn over her head, she was all ready for\nher journey. She stood waiting beside Peter, and as soon as his\nlast mouthful had disappeared she said, “Come along now.” As the\ntwo walked together Heidi had much to tell Peter of her two\ngoats that had been so unhappy the first day in their new stall\nthat they would not eat anything, but stood hanging their heads,\nnot even rousing themselves to bleat. And when she asked her\ngrandfather the reason of this, he told her it was with them as\nwith her in Frankfurt, for it was the first time in their lives\nthey had come down from the mountain. “And you don’t know what\nthat is, Peter, unless you have felt it yourself,” added Heidi.",
        "The children had nearly reached their destination before Peter\nopened his mouth; he appeared to be so sunk in thought that he\nhardly heard what was said to him. As they neared home, however,\nhe stood still and said in a somewhat sullen voice, “I had\nrather go to school even than get what Uncle threatened.”",
        "Heidi was of the same mind, and encouraged him in his good\nintention. They found Brigitta sitting alone knitting, for the\ngrandmother was not very well and had to stay the day in bed on\naccount of the cold. Heidi had never before missed the old\nfigure in her place in the corner, and she ran quickly into the\nnext room. There lay grandmother on her little poorly covered\nbed, wrapped up in her warm grey shawl.",
        "“Thank God,” she exclaimed as Heidi came running in; the poor\nold woman had had a secret fear at heart all through the autumn,\nespecially if Heidi was absent for any length of time, for Peter\nhad told her of a strange gentleman who had come from Frankfurt,\nand who had gone out with them and always talked to Heidi, and\nshe had felt sure he had come to take her away again. Even when\nshe heard he had gone off alone, she still had an idea that a\nmessenger would be sent over from Frankfurt to fetch the child.\nHeidi went up to the side of the bed and said, “Are you very\nill, grandmother?”",
        "“No, no, child,” answered the old woman reassuringly, passing\nher hand lovingly over the child’s head, “It’s only the frost\nthat has got into my bones a bit.”",
        "“Shall you be quite well then directly it turns warm again?”",
        "“Yes, God willing, or even before that, for I want to get back\nto my spinning; I thought perhaps I should do a little to-day,\nbut to-morrow I am sure to be all right again.” The old woman had\ndetected that Heidi was frightened and was anxious to set her\nmind at ease.",
        "Her words comforted Heidi, who had in truth been greatly\ndistressed, for she had never before seen the grandmother ill in\nbed. She now looked at the old woman seriously for a minute or\ntwo, and then said, “In Frankfurt everybody puts on a shawl to\ngo out walking; did you think it was to be worn in bed,\ngrandmother?”",
        "“I put it on, dear child, to keep myself from freezing, and I am\nso pleased with it, for my bedclothes are not very thick,” she\nanswered.",
        "“But, grandmother,” continued Heidi, “your bed is not right,\nbecause it goes downhill at your head instead of uphill.”",
        "“I know it, child, I can feel it,” and the grandmother put up\nher hand to the thin flat pillow, which was little more than a\nboard under her head, to make herself more comfortable; “the\npillow was never very thick, and I have lain on it now for so\nmany years that it has grown quite flat.”",
        "“Oh, if only I had asked Clara to let me take away my Frankfurt\nbed,” said Heidi. “I had three large pillows, one above the\nother, so that I could hardly sleep, and I used to slip down to\ntry and find a flat place, and then I had to pull myself up\nagain, because it was proper to sleep there like that. Could you\nsleep like that, grandmother?”",
        "“Oh, yes! the pillows keep one warm, and it is easier to breathe\nwhen the head is high,” answered the grandmother, wearily\nraising her head as she spoke as if trying to find a higher\nresting-place. “But we will not talk about that, for I have so\nmuch that other old sick people are without for which I thank\nGod; there is the nice bread I get every day, and this warm\nwrap, and your visits, Heidi. Will you read me something to-day?”",
        "Heidi ran into the next room to fetch the hymn book. Then she\npicked out the favorite hymns one after another, for she knew\nthem all by heart now, as pleased as the grandmother to hear\nthem again after so many days. The grandmother lay with folded\nhands, while a smile of peace stole over the worn, troubled face,\nlike one to whom good news has been brought.",
        "Suddenly Heidi paused. “Grandmother, are you feeling quite well\nagain already?”",
        "“Yes, child, I have grown better while listening to you; read it\nto the end.”",
        "The child read on, and when she came to the last words:–",
        "As the eyes grow dim, and darkness Closes round, the soul grows\nclearer,  Sees the goal to which it travels,  Gladly feels its\nhome is nearer.”",
        "the grandmother repeated them once or twice to herself, with a\nlook of happy expectation on her face. And Heidi took equal\npleasure in them, for the picture of the beautiful sunny day of\nher return home rose before her eyes, and she exclaimed\njoyfully, “Grandmother, I know exactly what it is like to go\nhome.” The old woman did not answer, but she had heard Heidi’s\nwords, and the expression that had made the child think she was\nbetter remained on her face.",
        "A little later Heidi said, “It is growing dark and I must go\nhome; I am glad to think, that you are quite well again.”",
        "The grandmother took the child’s hand in hers and held it\nclosely. “Yes,” she said, “I feel quite happy again; even if I\nhave to go on lying here, I am content. No one knows what it is\nto lie here alone day after day, in silence and darkness,\nwithout hearing a voice or seeing a ray of light. Sad thoughts\ncome over me, and I do not feel sometimes as if I could bear it\nany longer or as if it could ever be light again. But when you\ncome and read those words to me, then I am comforted and my heart\nrejoices once more.”",
        "Then she let the child go, and Heidi ran into the next room, and\nbid Peter come quickly, for it had now grown quite dark. But\nwhen they got outside they found the moon shining down on the\nwhite snow and everything as clear as in the daylight. Peter got\nhis sleigh, put Heidi at the back, he himself sitting in front to\nguide, and down the mountain they shot like two birds darting\nthrough the air.",
        "When Heidi was lying that night on her high bed of hay she\nthought of the grandmother on her low pillow, and of all she had\nsaid about the light and comfort that awoke in her when she\nheard the hymns, and she thought: if I could read to her every\nday, then I should go on making her better. But she knew that it\nwould be a week, if not two, before she would be able to go up\nthe mountain again. This was a thought of great trouble to Heidi,\nand she tried hard to think of some way which would enable the\ngrandmother to hear the words she loved every day. Suddenly an\nidea struck her, and she was so delighted with it that she could\nhardly bear to wait for morning, so eager was she to begin\ncarrying out her plan. All at once she sat upright in her bed,\nfor she had been so busy with her thoughts that she had\nforgotten to say her prayers, and she never now finished her day\nwithout saying them.",
        "When she had prayed with all her heart for herself, her\ngrandfather and grandmother, she lay back again on the warm soft\nhay and slept soundly and peacefully till morning broke.",
        "Peter arrived punctually at school the following day. He had\nbrought his dinner with him, for all the children who lived at a\ndistance regularly seated themselves at mid-day on the tables,\nand resting their feet firmly on the benches, spread out their\nmeal on their knees and so ate their dinner, while those living\nin Dorfli went home for theirs. Till one o’clock they might all\ndo as they liked, and then school began again. When Peter had\nfinished his lessons on the days he attended school, he went\nover to Uncle’s to see Heidi.",
        "When he walked into the large room at Uncle’s to-day, Heidi\nimmediately rushed forward and took hold of him, for it was for\nPeter she had been waiting. “I’ve thought of something, Peter,\"\nshe said hastily.",
        "“What is it?” he asked.",
        "“You must learn to read,” she informed him.",
        "“I have learnt,” was the answer.",
        "“Yes, yes, but I mean so that you can really make use of it,\"\ncontinued Heidi eagerly.",
        "“I never shall,” was the prompt reply.",
        "“Nobody believes that you cannot learn, nor I either now,” said\nHeidi in a very decided tone of voice. “Grandmamma in Frankfurt\nsaid long ago that it was not true, and she told me not to\nbelieve you.”",
        "Peter looked rather taken aback at this piece of intelligence.",
        "“I will soon teach you to read, for I know how,” continued\nHeidi. “You must learn at once, and then you can read one or two\nhymns every day to grandmother.”",
        "“Oh, I don’t care about that,” he grumbled in reply.",
        "This hard-hearted way of refusing to agree to what was right and\nkind, and to what Heidi had so much at heart, aroused her anger.\nWith flashing eyes she stood facing the boy and said\nthreateningly, “If you won’t learn as I want you to, I will tell\nyou what will happen; you know your mother has often spoken of\nsending you to Frankfurt, that you may learn a lot of things,\nand I know where the boys there have to go to school; Clara\npointed out the great house to me when we were driving together.\nAnd they don’t only go when they are boys, but have more lessons\nstill when they are grown men. I have seen them myself, and you\nmustn’t think they have only one kind teacher like we have. There\nare ever so many of them, all in the school at the same time, and\nthey are all dressed in black, as if they were going to church,\nand have black hats on their heads as high as that–” and Heidi\nheld out her hand to show their height from the floor.",
        "Peter felt a cold shudder run down his back.",
        "“And you will have to go in among all those gentlemen,\"\ncontinued Heidi with increasing animation, “and when it comes to\nyour turn you won’t be able to read and will make mistakes in\nyour spelling. Then you’ll see how they’ll make fun of you; even\nworse than Tinette, and you ought to have seen what she was like\nwhen she was scornful.”",
        "“Well, I’ll learn then,” said Peter, half sorrowfully and half\nangrily.",
        "Heidi was instantly mollified. “That’s right, then we’ll begin\nat once,” she said cheerfully, and went busily to work on the\nspot, dragging Peter to the table and fetching her books.",
        "Among other presents Clara had sent Heidi a book which the\nlatter had decided, in bed the night before, would serve\ncapitally for teaching Peter, for it was an A B C book with\nrhyming lines. And now the two sat together at the table with\ntheir heads bent over the book, for the lesson had begun.",
        "Peter was made to spell out the first sentence two or three\ntimes over, for Heidi wished him to get it correct and fluent. At\nlast she said, “You don’t seem able to get it right, but I will\nread it aloud to you once; when you know what it ought to be you\nwill find it easier.” And she read out:–",
        "          A B C must be learnt to-day\n           Or the judge will call you up to pay.",
        "“I shan’t go,” said Peter obstinately.",
        "“Go where?” asked Heidi.",
        "“Before the judge,” he answered.",
        "“Well then make haste and learn these three letters, then you\nwon’t have to go.”",
        "Peter went at his task again and repeated the three letters so\nmany times and with such determination that she said at last,–",
        "“You must know those three now.”",
        "Seeing what an effect the first two lines of verse had had upon\nhim, she thought she would prepare the ground a little for the\nfollowing lessons.",
        "“Wait, and I will read you some of the next sentences,” she\ncontinued, “then you will see what else there is to expect.”",
        "And she began in a clear slow voice:–",
        "          D E F G must run with ease\n           Or something will follow that does not please.",
        "          Should H I J K be now forgot\n           Disgrace is yours upon the spot.",
        "          And then L M must follow at once\n           Or punished you’ll be for a sorry dunce.",
        "          If you knew what next awaited you\n           You’d haste to learn N O P Q.",
        "          Now R S T be quick about\n           Or worse will follow there’s little doubt.",
        "Heidi paused, for Peter was so quiet that she looked to see what\nhe was doing. These many secret threats and hints of dreadful\npunishments had so affected him that he sat as if petrified and\nstared at Heidi with horror-stricken eyes. Her kind heart was\nmoved at once, and she said, wishing to reassure him, “You need\nnot be afraid, Peter; come here to me every evening, and if you\nlearn as you have to-day you will at last know all your letters,\nand the other things won’t come. But you must come regularly,\nnot now and then as you do to school; even if it snows it won’t\nhurt you.”",
        "Peter promised, for the trepidation he had been in had made him\nquite tame and docile. Lessons being finished for this day he\nnow went home.",
        "Peter obeyed Heidi’s instructions punctually, and every evening\nwent diligently to work to learn the following letters, taking\nthe sentences thoroughly to heart. The grandfather was\nfrequently in the room smoking his pipe comfortably while the\nlesson was going on, and his face twitched occasionally as if he\nwas overtaken with a sudden fit of merriment. Peter was often\ninvited to stay to supper after the great exertion he had gone\nthrough, which richly compensated him for the anguish of mind he\nhad suffered with the sentence for the day.",
        "So the winter went by, and Peter really made progress with his\nletters; but he went through a terrible fight each day with the\nsentences.",
        "He had got at last to U. Heidi read out:–",
        "          And if you put the U for V, \n           You’ll go where you would not like to be.",
        "Peter growled, “Yes, but I shan’t go!” But he was very diligent\nthat day, as if under the impression that some one would seize\nhim suddenly by the collar and drag him where he would rather\nnot go. The next evening Heidi read:–",
        "          If you falter at W, worst of all, \n           Look at the stick against the wall.",
        "Peter looked at the wall and said scornfully, “There isn’t one.”",
        "“Yes, but do you know what grandfather has in his box?” asked\nHeidi. “A stick as thick almost as your arm, and if he took that\nout, you might well say, look at the stick on the wall.”",
        "Peter knew that thick hazel stick, and immediately bent his head\nover the W and struggled to master it. Another day the lines ran:–",
        "          Then comes the X for you to say \n           Or be sure you’ll get no food to-day.",
        "Peter looked towards the cupboard where the bread and cheese\nwere kept and said crossly, “I never said that I should forget\nthe X.”",
        "“That’s all right; if you don’t forget it we can go on to learn\nthe next, and then you will only have one more,” replied Heidi,\nanxious to encourage him.",
        "Peter did not quite understand, but when Heidi went on and read:–",
        "          And should you make a stop at Y, \n           They’ll point at you and cry, Fie, fie.",
        "All the gentlemen in Frankfurt with tall black hats on their\nheads, and scorn and mockery in their faces rose up before his\nmind’s eye, and he threw himself with energy on the Y, not\nletting it go till at last he knew it so thoroughly that he\ncould see what it was like even when he shut his eyes.",
        "He arrived on the following day in a somewhat lofty frame of\nmind, for there was now only one letter to struggle over, and\nwhen Heidi began the lesson with reading aloud:–",
        "          Make haste with Z, if you’re too slow \n           Off to the Hottentots you’ll go.",
        "Peter remarked scornfully, “I dare say, when no one knows even\nwhere such people live.”",
        "“I assure you, Peter,” replied Heidi, “grandfather knows all\nabout them. Wait a second and I will run and ask him, for he is\nonly over the way with the pastor.” And she rose and ran to the\ndoor to put her words into action, but Peter cried out in a\nvoice of agony,–",
        "“Stop!” for he already saw himself being carried off by Alm-\nUncle and the pastor and sent straight away to the Hottentots,\nsince as yet he did not know his last letter. His cry of fear\nbrought Heidi back.",
        "“What is the matter?” she asked in astonishment.",
        "“Nothing! come back! I am going to learn my letter,” he said,\nstammering with fear. Heidi, however, herself wished to know\nwhere the Hottentots lived and persisted that she should ask her\ngrandfather, but she gave in at last to Peter’s despairing\nentreaties. She insisted on his doing something in return, and\nso not only had he to repeat his Z until it was so fixed in his\nmemory that he could never forget it again, but she began\nteaching him to spell, and Peter really made a good start that\nevening. So it went on from day to day.",
        "The frost had gone and the snow was soft again, and moreover\nfresh snow continually fell, so that it was quite three weeks\nbefore Heidi could go to the grandmother again. So much the more\neagerly did she pursue her teaching so that Peter might\ncompensate for her absence by reading hymns to the old woman.\nOne evening he walked in home after leaving Heidi, and as he\nentered he said, “I can do it now.”",
        "“Do what, Peter?” asked his mother.",
        "“Read,” he answered.",
        "“Do you really mean it? Did you hear that, grandmother?” she\ncalled out.",
        "The grandmother had heard, and was already wondering how such a\nthing could have come to pass.",
        "“I must read one of the hymns now; Heidi told me to,” he went on\nto inform them. His mother hastily fetched the book, and the\ngrandmother lay in joyful expectation, for it was so long since\nshe had heard the good words. Peter sat down to the table and\nbegan to read. His mother sat beside him listening with surprise\nand exclaiming at the close of each verse, “Who would have\nthought it possible!”",
        "The grandmother did not speak though she followed the words he\nread with strained attention.",
        "It happened on the day following this that there was a reading\nlesson in Peter’s class. When it came to his turn, the teacher\nsaid,–",
        "“We must pass over Peter as usual, or will you try again once\nmore–I will not say to read, but to stammer through a\nsentence.”",
        "Peter took the book and read off three lines without the\nslightest hesitation.",
        "The teacher put down his book and stared at Peter as at some out-\nof-the-way and marvellous thing unseen before. At last he spoke,–",
        "“Peter, some miracle has been performed upon you! Here have I\nbeen striving with unheard-of patience to teach you and you have\nnot hitherto been able to say your letters even. And now, just\nas I had made up my mind not to waste any more trouble upon you,\nyou suddenly are able to read a consecutive sentence properly and\ndistinctly. How has such a miracle come to pass in our days?”",
        "“It was Heidi,” answered Peter.",
        "The teacher looked in astonishment towards Heidi, who was\nsitting innocently on her bench with no appearance of anything\nsupernatural about her. He continued, “I have noticed a change\nin you altogether, Peter. Whereas formerly you often missed\ncoming to school for a week, or even weeks at a time, you have\nlately not stayed away a single day. Who has wrought this change\nfor good in you?”",
        "“It was Uncle,” answered Peter.",
        "With increasing surprise the teacher looked from Peter to Heidi\nand back again at Peter.",
        "“We will try once more,” he said cautiously, and Peter had again\nto show off his accomplishment by reading another three lines.\nThere was no mistake about it–Peter could read. As soon as\nschool was over the teacher went over to the pastor to tell him\nthis piece of news, and to inform him of the happy result of\nHeidi’s and the grandfather’s combined efforts.",
        "Every evening Peter read one hymn aloud; so far he obeyed Heidi.\nNothing would induce him to read a second, and indeed the\ngrandmother never asked for it. His mother Brigitta could not\nget over her surprise at her son’s attainment, and when the\nreader was in bed would often express her pleasure at it. “Now he\nhas learnt to read there is no knowing what may be made of him\nyet.”",
        "On one of these occasions the grandmother answered, “Yes, it is\ngood for him to have learnt something, but I shall indeed be\nthankful when spring is here again and Heidi can come; they are\nnot like the same hymns when Peter reads them. So many words\nseem missing, and I try to think what they ought to be and then I\nlose the sense, and so the hymns do not come home to my heart as\nwhen Heidi reads them.”",
        "The truth was that Peter arranged to make his reading as little\ntroublesome for himself as possible. When he came upon a word\nthat he thought was too long or difficult in any other way, he\nleft it out, for he decided that a word or two less in a verse,\nwhere there were so many of them, could make no difference to\nhis grandmother. And so it came about that most of the principal\nwords were missing in the hymns that Peter read aloud.",
        "It was the month of May. From every height the full fresh\nstreams of spring were flowing down into the valley. The clear\nwarm sunshine lay upon the mountain, which had turned green\nagain. The last snows had disappeared and the sun had already\ncoaxed many of the flowers to show their bright heads above the\ngrass. Up above the gay young wind of spring was singing through\nthe fir trees, and shaking down the old dark needles to make room\nfor the new bright green ones that were soon to deck out the\ntrees in their spring finery. Higher up still the great bird went\ncircling round in the blue ether as of old, while the golden\nsunshine lit up the grandfather’s hut, and all the ground about\nit was warm and dry again so that one might sit out where one\nliked. Heidi was at home again on the mountain, running backwards\nand forwards in her accustomed way, not knowing which spot was\nmost delightful. Now she stood still to listen to the deep,\nmysterious voice of the wind, as it blew down to her from the\nmountain summits, coming nearer and nearer and gathering strength\nas it came, till it broke with force against the fir trees,\nbending and shaking them, and seeming to shout for joy, so that\nshe too, though blown about like a feather, felt she must join in\nthe chorus of exulting sounds. Then she would run round again to\nthe sunny space in front of the hut, and seating herself on the\nground would peer closely into the short grass to see how many\nlittle flower cups were open or thinking of opening. She rejoiced\nwith all the myriad little beetles and winged insects that jumped\nand crawled and danced in the sun, and drew in deep draughts of\nthe spring scents that rose from the newly-awakened earth, and\nthought the mountain was more beautiful than ever. All the tiny\nliving creatures must be as happy as she, for it seemed to her\nthere were little voices all round her singing and humming in\njoyful tones, “On the mountain! on the mountain!”",
        "From the shed at the back came the sound of sawing and chopping,\nand Heidi listened to it with pleasure, for it was the old\nfamiliar sound she had known from the beginning of her life up\nhere. Suddenly she jumped up and ran round, for she must know\nwhat her grandfather was doing. In front of the shed door\nalready stood a finished new chair, and a second was in course of\nconstruction under the grandfather’s skilful hand.",
        "“Oh, I know what these are for,” exclaimed Heidi in great glee.\n\"We shall want them when they all come from Frankfurt. This one\nis for Grandmamma, and the one you are now making is for Clara,\nand then–then, there will, I suppose, have to be another,\"\ncontinued Heidi with more hesitation in her voice, “or do you\nthink, grandfather, that perhaps Fraulein Rottenmeier will not\ncome with them?”",
        "“Well, I cannot say just yet,” replied her grandfather, “but it\nwill be safer to make one so that we can offer her a seat if she\ndoes.”",
        "Heidi looked thoughtfully at the plain wooden chair without arms\nas if trying to imagine how Fraulein Rottenmeier and a chair of\nthis sort would suit one another. After a few minutes’\ncontemplation, “Grandfather,” she said, shaking her head\ndoubtfully, “I don’t think she would be able to sit on that.”",
        "“Then we will invite her on the couch with the beautiful green\nturf feather-bed,” was her grandfather’s quiet rejoinder.",
        "While Heidi was pausing to consider what this might be there\napproached from above a whistling, calling, and other sounds\nwhich Heidi immediately recognised. She ran out and found\nherself surrounded by her four-footed friends. They were\napparently as pleased as she was to be among the heights again,\nfor they leaped about and bleated for joy, pushing Heidi this way\nand that, each anxious to express his delight with some sign of\naffection. But Peter sent them flying to right and left, for he\nhad something to give to Heidi. When he at last got up to her he\nhanded her a letter.",
        "“There!” he exclaimed, leaving the further explanation of the\nmatter to Heidi herself.",
        "“Did some one give you this while you were out with the goats,\"\nshe asked, in her surprise.",
        "“No,” was the answer.",
        "“Where did you get it from then?",
        "“I found it in the dinner bag.”",
        "Which was true to a certain extent. The letter to Heidi had been\ngiven him the evening before by the postman at Dorfli, and Peter\nhad put it into his empty bag. That morning he had stuffed his\nbread and cheese on the top of it, and had forgotten it when he\nfetched Alm-Uncle’s two goats; only when he had finished his\nbread and cheese at mid-day and was searching in the bag for any\nlast crumbs did he remember the letter which lay at the bottom.",
        "Heidi read the address carefully; then she ran back to the shed\nholding out her letter to her grandfather in high glee. “From\nFrankfurt! from Clara! Would you like to hear it?”",
        "The grandfather was ready and pleased to do so, as also Peter,\nwho had followed Heidi into the shed. He leant his back against\nthe door post, as he felt he could follow Heidi’s reading better\nif firmly supported from behind, and so stood prepared to\nlisten.",
        "“Dearest Heidi,– Everything is packed and we shall start now in\ntwo or three days, as soon as papa himself is ready to leave; he\nis not coming with us as he has first to go to Paris. The doctor\ncomes every day, and as soon as he is inside the door, he cries,\n’Off now as quickly as you can, off to the mountain.’ He is most\nimpatient about our going. You cannot think how much he enjoyed\nhimself when he was with you! He has called nearly every day\nthis winter, and each time he has come in to my room and said he\nmust tell me about everything again. And then he sits down and\ndescribes all he did with you and the grandfather, and talks of\nthe mountains and the flowers and of the great silence up there\nfar above all towns and the villages, and of the fresh delicious\nair, and often adds, ’No one can help getting well up there.’ He\nhimself is quite a different man since his visit, and looks\nquite young again and happy, which he had not been for a long\ntime before. Oh, how I am looking forward to seeing everything\nand to being with you on the mountain, and to making the\nacquaintance of Peter and the goats.",
        "“I shall have first to go through a six weeks’ cure at Ragatz;\nthis the doctor has ordered, and then we shall move up to\nDorfli, and every fine day I shall be carried up the mountain in\nmy chair and spend the day with you. Grandmamma is travelling\nwith me and will remain with me; she also is delighted at the\nthought of paying you a visit. But just imagine, Fraulein\nRottenmeier refuses to come with us. Almost every day grandmamma\nsays to her, ’Well, how about this Swiss journey, my worthy\nRottenmeier? Pray say if you really would like to come with us.’\nBut she always thanks grandmamma very politely and says she has\nquite made up her mind. I think I know what has done it:\nSebastian gave such a frightful description of the mountain, of\nhow the rocks were so overhanging and dangerous that at any\nminute you might fall into a crevasse, and how it was such steep\nclimbing that you feared at every step to go slipping to the\nbottom, and that goats alone could make their way up without fear\nof being killed. She shuddered when she heard him tell of all\nthis, and since then she has not been so enthusiastic about\nSwitzerland as she was before. Fear has also taken possession of\nTinette, and she also refuses to come. So grandmamma and I will\nbe alone; Sebastian will go with us as far as Ragatz and then\nreturn here.",
        "“I can hardly bear waiting till I see you again. Good-bye,\ndearest Heidi; grandmamma sends you her best love and all good\nwishes.–Your affectionate friend,\n                                 “Clara.”",
        "Peter, as soon as the conclusion of the letter had been reached,\nleft his reclining position and rushed out, twirling his stick\nin the air in such a reckless fashion that the frightened goats\nfled down the mountain before him with higher and wider leaps\nthan usual. Peter followed at full speed, his stick still raised\nin air in a menacing manner as if he was longing to vent his fury\non some invisible foe. This foe was indeed the prospect of the\narrival of the Frankfurt visitors, the thought of whom filled\nhim with exasperation.",
        "Heidi was so full of joyful anticipation that she determined to\nseize the first possible moment next day to go down and tell\ngrandmother who was coming, and also particularly who was not\ncoming. These details would be of great interest to her, for\ngrandmother knew well all the persons named from Heidi’s\ndescription, and had entered with deep sympathy into all that\nthe child had told her of her life and surroundings in Frankfurt.\nHeidi paid her visit in the early afternoon, for she could now go\nalone again; the sun was bright in the heavens and the days were\ngrowing longer, and it was delightful to go racing down the\nmountain over the dry ground, with the brisk May wind blowing\nfrom behind, and speeding Heidi on her way a little more quickly\nthan her legs alone would have carried her.",
        "The grandmother was no longer confined to her bed. She was back\nin her corner at her spinning-wheel, but there was an expression\non her face of mournful anxiety. Peter had come in the evening\nbefore brimful of anger and had told about the large party who\nwere coming up from Frankfurt, and he did not know what other\nthings might happen after that; and the old woman had not slept\nall night, pursued by the old thought of Heidi being taken from\nher. Heidi ran in, and taking her little stool immediately sat\ndown by grandmother and began eagerly pouring out all her news,\ngrowing more excited with her pleasure as she went on. But all\nof a sudden she stopped short and said anxiously, “What is the\nmatter, grandmother, aren’t you a bit pleased with what I am\ntelling you?”",
        "“Yes, yes, of course, child, since it gives you so much\npleasure,” she answered, trying to look more cheerful.",
        "“But I can see all the same that something troubles you. Is it\nbecause you think after all that Fraulein Rottenmeier may come?\"\nasked Heidi, beginning to feel anxious herself.",
        "“No, no! it is nothing, child,” said the grandmother, wishing to\nreassure her. “Just give me your hand that I may feel sure you\nare there. No doubt it would be the best thing for you, although\nI feel I could scarcely survive it.”",
        "“I do not want anything of the best if you could scarcely\nsurvive it,” said Heidi, in such a determined tone of voice that\nthe grandmother’s fears increased as she felt sure the people\nfrom Frankfurt were coming to take Heidi back with them, since\nnow she was well again they naturally wished to have her with\nthem once more. But she was anxious to hide her trouble from\nHeidi if possible, as the latter was so sympathetic that she\nmight refuse perhaps to go away, and that would not be right. She\nsought for help, but not for long, for she knew of only one.",
        "“Heidi,” she said, “there is something that would comfort me and\ncalm my thoughts; read me the hymn beginning: ’All things will\nwork for good.’”",
        "Heidi found the place at once and read out in her clear young\nvoice:–",
        "          All things will work for good \n          To those who trust in Me;\n          I come with healing on my wings, \n          To save and set thee free.",
        "“Yes, yes, that is just what I wanted to hear,” said the\ngrandmother, and the deep expression of trouble passed from her\nface. Heidi looked at her thoughtfully for a minute or two and\nthen said, “Healing means that which cures everything and makes\neverybody well, doesn’t it, grandmother?”",
        "“Yes, that is it,” replied the old woman with a nod of assent,\n\"and we may be sure everything will come to pass according to\nGod’s good purpose. Read the verse again, that we may remember\nit well and not forget it again.”",
        "And Heidi read the words over two or three times, for she also\nfound pleasure in this assurance of all things being arranged\nfor the best.",
        "When the evening came, Heidi returned home up the mountain. The\nstars came out overhead one by one, so bright and sparkling that\neach seemed to send a fresh ray of joy into her heart; she was\nobliged to pause continually to look up, and as the whole sky at\nlast grew spangled with them she spoke aloud, “Yes, I understand\nnow why we feel so happy, and are not afraid about anything,\nbecause God knows what is good and beautiful for us.” And the\nstars with their glistening eyes continued to nod to her till\nshe reached home, where she found her grandfather also standing\nand looking up at them, for they had seldom been more glorious\nthan they were this night.",
        "Not only were the nights of this month of May so clear and\nbright, but the days as well; the sun rose every morning into\nthe cloudless sky, as undimmed in its splendor as when it sank\nthe evening before, and the grandfather would look out early and\nexclaim with astonishment, “This is indeed a wonderful year of\nsun; it will make all the shrubs and plants grow apace; you will\nhave to see, general, that your army does not get out of hand\nfrom overfeeding.” And Peter would swing his stick with an air\nof assurance and an expression on his face as much as to say,\n\"see to that.”",
        "So May passed, everything growing greener and greener, and then\ncame the month of June, with a hotter sun and long light days,\nthat brought the flowers out all over the mountain, so that\nevery spot was bright with them and the air full of their sweet\nscents. This month too was drawing to its close when one day\nHeidi, having finished her domestic duties, ran out with the\nintention of paying first a visit to the fir trees, and then\ngoing up higher to see if the bush of rock roses was yet in\nbloom, for its flowers were so lovely when standing open in the\nsun. But just as she was turning the corner of the hut, she gave\nsuch a loud cry that her grandfather came running out of the shed\nto see what had happened.",
        "“Grandfather, grandfather!” she cried, beside herself with\nexcitement. “Come here! look! look!”",
        "The old man was by her side by this time and looked in the\ndirection of her outstretched hand.",
        "A strange looking procession was making its way up the mountain;\nin front were two men carrying a sedan chair, in which sat a\ngirl well wrapped up in shawls; then followed a horse, mounted by\na stately-looking lady who was looking about her with great\ninterest and talking to the guide who walked beside her; then a\nreclining chair, which was being pushed up by another man, it\nhaving evidently been thought safer to send the invalid to whom\nit belonged up the steep path in a sedan chair. The procession\nwound up with a porter, with such a bundle of cloaks, shawls,\nand furs on his back that it rose well above his head.",
        "“Here they come! here they come!” shouted Heidi, jumping with\njoy. And sure enough it was the party from Frankfurt; the\nfigures came nearer and nearer, and at last they had actually\narrived. The men in front put down their burden, Heidi rushed\nforward and the two children embraced each other with mutual\ndelight. Grandmamma having also reached the top, dismounted, and\ngave Heidi an affectionate greeting, before turning to the\ngrandfather, who had meanwhile come up to welcome his guests.\nThere was no constraint about the meeting, for they both knew\neach other perfectly well from hearsay and felt like old\nacquaintances.",
        "After the first words of greeting had been exchanged grandmamma\nbroke out into lively expressions of admiration. “What a\nmagnificent residence you have, Uncle! I could hardly have\nbelieved it was so beautiful! A king might well envy you! And\nhow well my little Heidi looks–like a wild rose!” she continued,\ndrawing the child towards her and stroking her fresh pink\ncheeks. “I don’t know which way to look first, it is all so\nlovely! What do you say to it, Clara, what do you say?”",
        "Clara was gazing round entranced; she had never imagined, much\nless seen, anything so beautiful. She gave vent to her delight\nin cries of joy. “O grandmamma,” she said, “I should like to\nremain here for ever.”",
        "The grandfather had meanwhile drawn up the invalid chair and\nspread some of the wraps over it; he now went up to Clara.",
        "“Supposing we carry the little daughter now to her accustomed\nchair; I think she will be more comfortable, the travelling\nsedan is rather hard,” he said, and without waiting for any one\nto help him he lifted the child in his strong arms and laid her\ngently down on her own couch. He then covered her over carefully\nand arranged her feet on the soft cushion, as if he had never\ndone anything all his life but attend on cripples. The grandmamma\nlooked on with surprise.",
        "“My dear Uncle,” she exclaimed, “if I knew where you had learned\nto nurse I would at once send all the nurses I know to the same\nplace that they might handle their patients in like manner. How\ndo you come to know so much?”",
        "Uncle smiled. “I know more from experience than training,” he\nanswered, but as he spoke the smile died away and a look of\nsadness passed over his face. The vision rose before him of a\nface of suffering that he had known long years before, the face\nof a man lying crippled on his couch of pain, and unable to move\na limb. The man had been his Captain during the fierce fighting\nin Sicily; he had found him lying wounded and had carried him\naway, and after that the captain would suffer no one else near\nhim, and Uncle had stayed and nursed him till his sufferings\nended in death. It all came back to Uncle now, and it seemed\nnatural to him to attend on the sick Clara and to show her all\nthose kindly attentions with which he had been once so familiar.",
        "The sky spread blue and cloudless over the hut and the fir trees\nand far above over the high rocks, the grey summits of which\nglistened in the sun. Clara could not feast her eyes enough on\nall the beauty around her.",
        "“O Heidi, if only I could walk about with you,” she said\nlongingly, “if I could but go and look at the fir trees and at\neverything I know so well from your description, although I have\nnever been here before.”",
        "Heidi in response put out all her strength, and after a slight\neffort, managed to wheel Clara’s chair quite easily round the\nhut to the fir trees. There they paused. Clara had never seen\nsuch trees before, with their tall, straight stems, and long\nthick branches growing thicker and thicker till they touched the\nground. Even the grandmamma, who had followed the children, was\nastonished at the sight of them. She hardly knew what to admire\nmost in these ancient trees: the lofty tops rising in their full\ngreen splendor towards the sky, or the pillar-like stems, with\ntheir straight and gigantic boughs, that spoke of such antiquity\nof age, of such long years during which they had looked down\nupon the valley below, where men came and went, and all things\nwere continually changing, while they stood undisturbed and\nchangeless.",
        "Heidi had now wheeled Clara on to the goat shed, and had flung\nopen the door, so that Clara might have a full view of all that\nwas inside. There was not much to see just now as its indwellers\nwere absent. Clara lamented to her grandmother that they would\nhave to leave early before the goats came home. “I should so\nlike to have seen Peter and his whole flock.”",
        "“Dear child, let us enjoy all the beautiful things that we can\nsee, and not think about those that we cannot,” grandmamma\nreplied as she followed the chair which Heidi was pushing\nfurther on.",
        "“Oh, the flowers!” exclaimed Clara. “Look at the bushes of red\nflowers, and all the nodding blue bells! Oh, if I could but get\nup and pick some!”",
        "Heidi ran off at once and picked her a large nosegay of them.",
        "“But these are nothing, Clara,” she said, laying the flowers on\nher lap. “If you could come up higher to where the goats are\nfeeding, then you would indeed see something! Bushes on bushes\nof the red centaury, and ever so many more of the blue bell-\nflowers; and then the bright yellow rock roses, that gleam like\npure gold, and all crowding together in the one spot. And then\nthere are others with the large leaves that grandfather calls\nBright Eyes, and the brown ones with little round heads that\nsmell so delicious. Oh, it is beautiful up there, and if you sit\ndown among them you never want to get up again, everything looks\nand smells so lovely!”",
        "Heidi’s eyes sparkled with the remembrance of what she was\ndescribing; she was longing herself to see it all again, and\nClara caught her enthusiasm and looked back at her with equal\nlonging in her soft blue eyes.",
        "“Grandmamma, do you think I could get up there? Is it possible\nfor me to go?” she asked eagerly. “If only I could walk, climb\nabout everywhere with you, Heidi!”",
        "“I am sure I could push you up, the chair goes so easily,” said\nHeidi, and in proof of her words, she sent the chair at such a\npace round the corner that it nearly went flying down the\nmountain-side. Grandmamma being at hand, however, stopped it in\ntime.",
        "The grandfather, meantime, had not been idle. He had by this\ntime put the table and extra chairs in front of the seat, so that\nthey might all sit out here and eat the dinner that was preparing\ninside. The milk and the cheese were soon ready, and then the\ncompany sat down in high spirits to their mid-day meal.",
        "Grandmamma was enchanted, as the doctor had been, with their\ndining-room, whence one could see far along the valley, and far\nover the mountains to the farthest stretch of blue sky. A light\nwind blew refreshingly over them as they sat at table, and the\nrustling of the fir trees made a festive accompaniment to the\nrepast.",
        "“I never enjoyed anything as much as this. It is really superb!\"\ncried grandmamma two or three times over; and then suddenly in a\ntone of surprise,",
        "“Do I really see you taking a second piece of toasted cheese,\nClara!”",
        "There, sure enough, was a second golden-colored slice of cheese\non Clara’s plate.",
        "“Oh, it does taste so nice, grandmamma–better than all the\ndishes we have at Ragatz,” replied Clara, as she continued\neating with appetite.",
        "“That’s right, eat what you can!” exclaimed Uncle. “It’s the\nmountain air which makes up for the deficiencies of the\nkitchen.”",
        "And so the meal went on. Grandmamma and Alm-Uncle got on very\nwell together, and their conversation became more and more\nlively. They were so thoroughly agreed in their opinions of men\nand things and the world in general that they might have been\ntaken for old cronies. The time passed merrily, and then\ngrandmamma looked towards the west and said,–",
        "“We must soon get ready to go, Clara, the sun is a good way\ndown; the men will be here directly with the horse and sedan.”",
        "Clara’s face fell and she said beseechingly, “Oh, just another\nhour, grandmamma, or two hours. We haven’t seen inside the hut\nyet, or Heidi’s bed, or any of the other things. If only the day\nwas ten hours long!”",
        "“Well, that is not possible,” said grandmamma, but she herself\nwas anxious to see inside the hut, so they all rose from the\ntable and Uncle wheeled Clara’s chair to the door. But there\nthey came to a standstill, for the chair was much too broad to\npass through the door. Uncle, however, soon settled the\ndifficulty by lifting Clara in his strong arms and carrying her\ninside.",
        "Grandmamma went all round and examined the household\narrangements, and was very much amused and pleased at their\norderliness and the cozy appearance of everything. “And this is\nyour bedroom up here, Heidi, is it not?” she asked, as without\ntrepidation she mounted the ladder to the hay loft. “Oh, it does\nsmell sweet, what a healthy place to sleep in.” She went up to\nthe round window and looked out, and grandfather followed up\nwith Clara in his arms, Heidi springing up after them. Then they\nall stood and examined Heidi’s wonderful hay-bed, and grandmamma\nlooked thoughtfully at it and drew in from time to time fragrant\ndraughts of the hay-perfumed air, while Clara was charmed beyond\nwords with Heidi’s sleeping apartment.",
        "“It is delightful for you up here, Heidi! You can look from your\nbed straight into the sky, and then such a delicious smell all\nround you! and outside the fir trees waving and rustling! I have\nnever seen such a pleasant, cheerful bedroom before.”",
        "Uncle looked across at the grandmamma. “I have been thinking,\"\nhe said to her, “that if you were willing to agree to it, your\nlittle granddaughter might remain up here, and I am sure she\nwould grow stronger. You have brought up all kinds of shawls and\ncovers with you, and we could make up a soft bed out of them,\nand as to the general looking after the child, you need have no\nfear, for I will see to that.” Clara and Heidi were as overjoyed\nat these words as if they were two birds let out of their cages,\nand grandmamma’s face beamed with satisfaction.",
        "“You are indeed kind, my dear Uncle,” she exclaimed; “you give\nwords to the thought that was in my own mind. I was only asking\nmyself whether a stay up here might not be the very thing she\nwanted. But then the trouble, the inconvenience to yourself! And\nyou speak of nursing and looking after her as if it was a mere\nnothing! I thank you sincerely, I thank you from my whole heart,\nUncle.” And she took his hand and gave it a long and grateful\nshake, which he returned with a pleased expression of\ncountenance.",
        "Uncle immediately set to work to get things ready. He carried\nClara back to her chair outside, Heidi following, not knowing\nhow to jump high enough into the air to express her contentment.\nThen he gathered up a whole pile of shawls and furs and said,\nsmiling, “It is a good thing that grandmamma came up well\nprovided for a winter’s campaign; we shall be able to make good\nuse of these.”",
        "“Foresight is a virtue,” responded the lady, amused, “and\nprevents many misfortunes. If we have made the journey over your\nmountains without meeting with storms, winds and cloud-bursts,\nwe can only be thankful, which we are, and my provision against\nthese disasters now comes in usefully, as you say.”",
        "The two had meanwhile ascended to the hay-loft and begun to\nprepare a bed; there were so many articles piled one over the\nother that when finished it looked like a regular little\nfortress. Grandmamma passed her hand carefully over it to make\nsure there were no bits of hay sticking out. “If there’s a bit\nthat can come through it will,” she said. The soft mattress,\nhowever, was so smooth and thick that nothing could penetrate\nit. Then they went down again, well satisfied, and found the\nchildren laughing and talking together and arranging all they\nwere going to do from morning till evening as long as Clara\nstayed. The next question was how long she was to remain, and\nfirst grandmamma was asked, but she referred them to the\ngrandfather, who gave it as his opinion that she ought to make\nthe trial of the mountain air for at least a month. The children\nclapped their hands for joy, for they had not expected to be\ntogether for so long a time.",
        "The bearers and the horse and guide were now seen approaching;\nthe former were sent back at once, and grandmamma prepared to\nmount for her return journey.",
        "“It’s not saying good-bye, grandmamma,” Clara called out, “for\nyou will come up now and then and see how we are getting on, and\nwe shall so look forward to your visits, shan’t we, Heidi?”",
        "Heidi, who felt that life this day had been crowded with\npleasures, could only respond to Clara with another jump of joy.",
        "Grandmamma being now seated on her sturdy animal, Uncle took the\nbridle to lead her down the steep mountain path; she begged him\nnot to come far with her, but he insisted on seeing her safely\nas far as Dorfli, for the way was precipitous and not without\ndanger for the rider, he said.",
        "Grandmamma did not care to stay alone in Dorfli, and therefore\ndecided to return to Ragatz, and thence to make excursions up\nthe mountain from time to time.",
        "Peter came down with his goats before Uncle had returned. As\nsoon as the animals caught sight of Heidi they all came flocking\ntowards her, and she, as well as Clara on her couch, were soon\nsurrounded by the goats, pushing and poking their heads one over\nthe other, while Heidi introduced each in turn by its name to\nher friend Clara.",
        "It was not long before the latter had made the long-wished-for\nacquaintance of little Snowflake, the lively Greenfinch, and the\nwell-behaved goats belonging to grandfather, as well as of the\nmany others, including the Grand Turk. Peter meanwhile stood\napart looking on, and casting somewhat unfriendly glances\ntowards Clara.",
        "When the two children called out, “Good-evening, Peter,” he made\nno answer, but swung up his stick angrily, as if wanting to cut\nthe air in two, and then ran off with his goats after him.",
        "The climax to all the beautiful things that Clara had already\nseen upon the mountain came at the close of the day.",
        "As she lay on the large soft bed in the hay loft, with Heidi\nnear her, she looked out through the round open window right into\nthe middle of the shining clusters of stars, and she exclaimed in\ndelight,–",
        "“Heidi, it’s just as if we were in a high carriage and were\ngoing to drive straight into heaven.”",
        "“Yes, and do you know why the stars are so happy and look down\nand nod to us like that?” asked Heidi.",
        "“No, why is it?” Clara asked in return.",
        "“Because they live up in heaven, and know how well God arranges\neverything for us, so that we need have no more fear or trouble\nand may be quite sure that all things will come right in the\nend. That’s why they are so happy, and they nod to us because\nthey want us to be happy too. But then we must never forget to\npray, and to ask God to remember us when He is arranging things,\nso that we too may feel safe and have no anxiety about what is\ngoing to happen.”",
        "The two children now sat up and said their prayers, and then\nHeidi put her head down on her little round arm and fell off to\nsleep at once, but Clara lay awake some time, for she could not\nget over the wonder of this new experience of being in bed up\nhere among the stars. She had indeed seldom seen a star, for she\nnever went outside the house at night, and the curtains at home\nwere always drawn before the stars came out. Each time she\nclosed her eyes she felt she must open them again to see if the\ntwo very large stars were still looking in, and nodding to her as\nHeidi said they did. There they were, always in the same place,\nand Clara felt she could not look long enough into their bright\nsparkling faces, until at last her eyes closed of their own\naccord, and it was only in her dreams that she still saw the two\nlarge friendly stars shining down upon her.",
        "The sun had just risen above the mountains and was shedding its\nfirst golden rays over the hut and the valley below. Alm-Uncle,\nas was his custom, had been standing in a quiet and, devout\nattitude for some little while, watching the light mists\ngradually lifting, and the heights and valley emerging from\ntheir twilight shadows and awakening to another day.",
        "The light morning clouds overhead grew brighter and brighter,\ntill at last the sun shone out in its full glory, and rock and\nwood and hill lay bathed in golden light.",
        "Uncle now stepped back into the hut and went softly up the\nladder. Clara had just opened her eyes and was looking with\nwonder at the bright sunlight that shone through the round\nwindow and danced and sparkled about her bed. She could not at\nfirst think what she was looking at or where she was. Then she\ncaught sight of Heidi sleeping beside her, and now she heard the\ngrandfather’s cheery voice asking her if she had slept well and\nwas feeling rested. She assured him she was not tired, and that\nwhen she had once fallen asleep she had not opened her eyes\nagain all night. The grandfather was satisfied at this and\nimmediately began to attend upon her with so much gentleness and\nunderstanding that it seemed as if his chief calling had been to\nlook after sick children.",
        "Heidi now awoke and was surprised to see Clara dressed, and\nalready in the grandfather’s arms ready to be carried down. She\nmust be up too, and she went through her toilette with lightning-\nlike speed. She ran down the ladder and out of the hut, and there\nfurther astonishment awaited her, for grandfather had been busy\nthe night before after they were in bed. Seeing that it was\nimpossible to get Clara’s chair through the hut-door, he had\ntaken down two of the boards at the side of the shed and made an\nopening large enough to admit the chair; these he left loose so\nthat they could be taken away and put up at pleasure. He was at\nthis moment wheeling Clara out into the sun; he left her in\nfront of the hut while he went to look after the goats, and Heidi\nran up to her friend.",
        "The fresh morning breeze blew round the children’s faces, and\nevery fresh puff brought a waft of fragrance from the fir trees.\nClara drew it in with delight and lay back in her chair with an\nunaccustomed feeling of health and comfort.",
        "It was the first time in her life that she had been out in the\nopen country at this early hour and felt the fresh morning\nbreeze, and the pure mountain air was so cool and refreshing\nthat every breath she drew was a pleasure. And then the bright\nsweet sun, which was not hot and sultry up here, but lay soft and\nwarm on her hands and on the grass at her feet. Clara had not\nimagined that it would be like this on the mountain.",
        "“O Heidi, if only I could stay up here for ever with you,” she\nexclaimed happily, turning in her chair from side to side that\nshe might drink in the air and sun from all quarters.",
        "“Now you see that it is just what I told you,” replied Heidi\ndelighted; “that it is the most beautiful thing in the world to\nbe up here with grandfather.”",
        "The latter at that moment appeared coming from the goat shed and\nbringing two small foaming bowls of snow-white milk–one for\nClara and one for Heidi.",
        "“That will do the little daughter good,” he said, nodding to\nClara; “it is from Little Swan and will make her strong. To your\nhealth, child! drink it up.”",
        "Clara had never tasted goat’s milk before; she hesitated and\nsmelt it before putting it to her lips, but seeing how Heidi\ndrank hers up without hesitating, and how much she seemed to like\nit, Clara did the same, and drank till there was not a drop left,\nfor she too found it delicious, tasting just as if sugar and\ncinnamon had been mixed with it.",
        "“To-morrow we will drink two,” said the grandfather, who had\nlooked on with satisfaction at seeing her follow Heidi’s\nexample.",
        "Peter now arrived with the goats, and while Heidi was receiving\nher usual crowded morning greetings, Uncle drew Peter aside to\nspeak to him, for the goats, bleated so loudly and continuously\nin their wish to express their joy and affection that no one\ncould be heard near them.",
        "“Attend to what I have to say,” he said. “From to-day be sure you\nlet Little Swan go where she likes. She has an instinct where to\nfind the best food for herself, and so if she wants to climb\nhigher, you follow her, and it will do the others no harm if they\ngo too; on no account bring her back. A little more climbing\nwon’t hurt you, and in this matter she probably knows better than\nyou what is good for her; I want her to give as fine milk as\npossible. Why are you looking over there as if you wanted to eat\nsomebody? Nobody will interfere with you. So now be off and\nremember what I say.”",
        "Peter was accustomed to give immediate obedience to Uncle, and\nhe marched off with his goats, but with a turn of the head and\nroll of the eye that showed he had some thought in reserve. The\ngoats carried Heidi along with them a little way, which was what\nPeter wanted. “You will have to come with them,” he called to\nher, “for I shall be obliged to follow Little Swan.”",
        "“I cannot,” Heidi called back from the midst of her friends,\n\"and I shall not be able to come for a long, long time–not as\nlong as Clara is with me. Grandfather, however, has promised to\ngo up the mountain with both of us one day.”",
        "Heidi had now extricated herself from the goats and she ran back\nto Clara. Peter doubled his fists and made threatening gestures\ntowards the invalid on her couch, and then climbed up some\ndistance without pause until he was out of sight, for he was\nafraid Uncle might have seen him, and he did not care to know\nwhat Uncle might have thought of the fists.",
        "Clara and Heidi had made so many plans for themselves that they\nhardly knew where to begin. Heidi suggested that they should\nfirst write to grandmamma, to whom they had promised to send word\nevery day, for grandmamma had not felt sure whether it would in\nthe long run suit Clara’s health to remain up the mountain, or if\nshe would continue to enjoy herself there. With daily news of her\ngranddaughter she could stay on without anxiety at Ragatz, and be\nready to go to Clara at a moment’s notice.",
        "“Must we go indoors to write?” asked Clara, who agreed to Heidi’s\nproposal but did not want to move from where she was, as it was\nso much nicer outside. Heidi was prepared to arrange everything.\nShe ran in and brought out her school-book and writing things and\nher own little stool. She put her reading book and copy book on\nClara’s knees, to make a desk for her to write upon, and she\nherself took her seat on the stool and sat to the bench, and then\nthey both began writing to grandmamma. But Clara paused after\nevery sentence to look about her; it was too beautiful for much\nletter writing. The breeze had sunk a little, and now only gently\nfanned her face and whispered lightly through the fir trees.\nLittle winged insects hummed and danced around her in the clear\nair, and a great stillness lay over the far, wide, sunny pasture\nlands. Lofty and silent rose the high mountain peaks above her,\nand below lay the whole broad valley full of quiet peace. Only\nnow and again the call of some shepherd-boy rang out through the\nair, and echo answered softly from the rocks. The morning passed,\nthe children hardly knew how, and now grandfather came with the\nmid-day bowls of steaming milk, for the little daughter, he said,\nwas to remain out as long as there was a gleam of sun in the sky.\nThe mid-day meal was set out and eaten as yesterday in the open\nair. Then Heidi pushed Clara’s chair under the fir trees, for\nthey had agreed to spend the afternoon under their shade and\nthere tell each other all that had happened since Heidi left\nFrankfurt. If everything had gone on there as usual in a general\nway, there were still all kinds of particular things to tell\nHeidi about the various people who composed the Sesemann\nhousehold, and who were all so well known to Heidi.",
        "So they sat and chatted under the trees, and the more lively\ngrew their conversation, the more loudly sang the birds overhead,\nas if wishing to take part in the children’s gossip, which\nevidently pleased them. So the hours flew by and all at once, as\nit seemed, the evening had come with the returning Peter, who\nstill scowled and looked angry.",
        "“Good-night, Peter,” called out Heidi, as she saw he had no\nintention of stopping to speak.",
        "“Good-night, Peter,” called out Clara in a friendly voice. Peter\ntook no notice and went surlily on with his goats.",
        "As Clara saw the grandfather leading away Little Swan to milk\nher, she was suddenly taken with a longing for another bowlful\nof the fragrant milk, and waited impatiently for it.",
        "“Isn’t it curious, Heidi,” she said, astonished at herself, “as\nlong as I can remember I have only eaten because I was obliged\nto, and everything used to seem to taste of cod liver oil, and I\nwas always wishing there was no need to eat or drink; and now I\nam longing for grandfather to bring me the milk.”",
        "“Yes, I know what it feels like,” replied Heidi, who remembered\nthe many days in Frankfurt when all her food used to seem to\nstick in her throat. Clara, however, could not understand it;\nthe fact was that she had never in her life before spent a whole\nday in the open air, much less in such high, life-giving mountain\nair. When grandfather at last brought her the evening milk, she\ndrank it up so quickly that she had emptied her bowl before\nHeidi, and then she asked for a little more. The grandfather\nwent inside with both the children’s bowls, and when he brought\nthem out again full he had something else to add to their supper.\nHe had walked over that afternoon to a herdsman’s house where the\nsweetly-tasting butter was made, and had brought home a large\npat, some of which he had now spread thickly on two good slices\nof bread. He stood and watched with pleasure while Clara and\nHeidi ate their appetising meal with childish hunger and\nenjoyment.",
        "That night, when Clara lay down in her bed and prepared to watch\nthe stars, her eyes would not keep open, and she fell asleep as\nsoon as Heidi and slept soundly all night–a thing she never\nremembered having done before. The following day and the day\nafter passed in the same pleasant fashion, and the third day\nthere came a surprise for the children. Two stout porters came\nup the mountain, each carrying a bed on his shoulders with\nbedding of all kinds and two beautiful new white coverlids. The\nmen also had a letter with them from grandmamma, in which she\nsaid that these were for Clara and Heidi, and that Heidi in\nfuture was always to sleep in a proper bed, and when she went\ndown to Dorfli in the winter she was to take one with her and\nleave the other at the hut, so that Clara might always know there\nwas a bed ready for her when she paid a visit to the mountain.\nShe went on to thank the children for their long letters and\nencouraged them to continue writing daily, so that she might be\nable to picture all they were doing.",
        "So the grandfather went up and threw back the hay from Heidi’s\nbed on to the great heap, and then with his help the beds were\ntransported to the loft. He put them close to one another so\nthat the children might still be able to see out of the window,\nfor he knew what pleasure they had in the light from the sun and\nstars.",
        "Meanwhile grandmamma down at Ragatz was rejoicing at the\nexcellent news of the invalid which reached her daily from the\nmountain. Clara found the life more charming each day and could\nnot say enough of the kindness and care which the grandfather\nlavished upon her, nor of Heidi’s lively and amusing\ncompanionship, for the latter was more entertaining even than\nwhen in Frankfurt with her, and Clara’s first thought when she\nwoke each morning was, “Oh, how glad I am to be here still.”",
        "Having such fresh assurances each day that all was going well\nwith Clara, grandmamma thought she might put off her visit to\nthe children a little longer, for the steep ride up and down was\nsomewhat of a fatigue to her.",
        "The grandfather seemed to feel an especial sympathy for this\nlittle invalid charge, for he tried to think of something fresh\nevery day to help forward her recovery. He climbed up the\nmountain every afternoon, higher and higher each day, and came\nhome in the evening with a large bunch of leaves which scented\nthe air with a mingled fragrance as of carnations and thyme,\neven from afar. He hung it up in the goat shed, and the goats on\ntheir return were wild to get at it, for they recognised the\nsmell. But Uncle did not go climbing after rare plants to give\nthe goats the pleasure of eating them without any trouble of\nfinding them; what he gathered was for Little Swan alone, that\nshe might give extra fine milk, and the effect of the extra\nfeeding was shown in the way she flung her head in the air with\never-increasing frolicsomeness, and in the bright glow of her\neye.",
        "Clara had now been on the mountain for three weeks. For some\ndays past the grandfather, each morning after carrying her down,\nhad said, “Won’t the little daughter try if she can stand for a\nminute or two?” And Clara had made the effort in order to please\nhim, but had clung to him as soon as her feet touched the\nground, exclaiming that it hurt her so. He let her try a little\nlonger, however, each day.",
        "It was many years since they had had such a splendid summer\namong the mountains. Day after day there were the same cloudless\nsky and brilliant sun; the flowers opened wide their fragrant\nblossoms, and everywhere the eye was greeted with a glow of\ncolor; and when the evening came the crimson light fell on\nmountain peaks and on the great snow-field, till at last the sun\nsank in a sea of golden flame.",
        "And Heidi never tired of telling Clara of all this, for only\nhigher up could the full glory of the colors be rightly seen;\nand more particularly did she dwell on the beauty of the spot on\nthe higher slope of the mountain, where the bright golden rock-\nroses grew in masses, and the blue flowers were in such numbers\nthat the very grass seemed to have turned blue, while near these\nwere whole bushes of the brown blossoms, with their delicious\nscent, so that you never wanted to move again when you once sat\ndown among them.",
        "She had just been expatiating on the flowers as she sat with\nClara under the fir trees one evening, and had been telling her\nagain of the wonderful light from the evening sun, when such an\nirrepressible longing came over her to see it all once more that\nshe jumped up and ran to her grandfather, who was in the shed,\ncalling out almost before she was inside,–",
        "“Grandfather, will you take us out with the goats to-morrow? Oh,\nit is so lovely up there now!”",
        "“Very well,” he answered, “but if I do, the little daughter must\ndo something to please me: she must try her best again this\nevening to stand on her feet.”",
        "Heidi ran back with the good news to Clara, and the latter\npromised to try her very best as the grandfather wished, for she\nlooked forward immensely to the next day’s excursion. Heidi was\nso pleased and excited that she called out to Peter as soon as\nshe caught sight of him that evening,–",
        "“Peter, Peter, we are all coming out with you to-morrow and are\ngoing to stay up there the whole day.”",
        "Peter, cross as a bear, grumbled some reply, and lifted his\nstick to give Greenfinch a blow for no reason in particular, but\nGreenfinch saw the movement, and with a leap over Snowflake’s\nback she got out of the way, and the stick only hit the air.",
        "Clara and Heidi got into their two fine beds that night full of\ndelightful anticipation of the morrow; they were so full of\ntheir plans that they agreed to keep awake all night and talk\nover them until they might venture to get up. But their heads had\nno sooner touched their soft pillows than the conversation\nsuddenly ceased, and Clara fell into a dream of an immense field,\nwhich looked the color of the sky, so thickly inlaid was it with\nblue bell-shaped flowers; and Heidi heard the great bird of prey\ncalling to her from the heights above, “Come! come! come!”",
        "Uncle went out early the next morning to see what kind of a day\nit was going to be. There was a reddish gold light over the\nhigher peaks; a light breeze springing up and the branches of the\nfir trees moved gently to and fro the sun was on its way.",
        "The old man stood and watched the green slopes under the higher\npeaks gradually growing brighter with the coming day and the dark\nshadows lifting from the valley, until at first a rosy light\nfilled its hollows, and then the morning gold flooded every\nheight and depth–the sun had risen.",
        "Uncle wheeled the chair out of the shed ready for the coming\njourney, and then went in to call the children and tell them what\na lovely sunrise it was.",
        "Peter came up at this moment. The goats did not gather round him\nso trustfully as usual, but seemed to avoid him timidly, for\nPeter had reached a high pitch of anger and bitterness, and was\nlaying about him with his stick very unnecessarily, and where it\nfell the blow was no light one. For weeks now he had not had\nHeidi all to himself as formerly. When he came up in the morning\nthe invalid child was always already in her chair and Heidi fully\noccupied with her. And it was the same thing over again when he\ncame down in the evening. She had not come out with the goats\nonce this summer, and now to-day she was only coming in company\nwith her friend and the chair, and would stick by the latter’s\nside the whole time. It was the thought of this which was making\nhim particularly cross this morning. There stood the chair on its\nhigh wheels; Peter seemed to see something proud and disdainful\nabout it, and he glared at it as at an enemy that had done him\nharm and was likely to do him more still to-day. He glanced\nround–there was no sound anywhere, no one to see him. He sprang\nforward like a wild creature, caught hold of it, and gave it a\nviolent and angry push in the direction of the slope. The chair\nrolled swiftly forward and in another minute had disappeared.",
        "Peter now sped up the mountain as if on wings, not pausing till\nhe was well in shelter of a large blackberry bush, for he had no\nwish to be seen by Uncle. But he was anxious to see what had\nbecome of the chair, and his bush was well placed for that.\nHimself hidden, he could watch what happened below and see what\nUncle did without being discovered himself. So he looked, and\nthere he saw his enemy running faster and faster down hill, then\nit turned head over heels several times, and finally, after one\ngreat bound, rolled over and over to its complete destruction.\nThe pieces flew in every direction–feet, arms, and torn\nfragments of the padded seat and bolster–and Peter experienced a\nfeeling of such unbounded delight at the sight that he leapt in\nthe air, laughing aloud and stamping for joy; then he took a run\nround, jumping over bushes on the way, only to return to the same\nspot and fall into fresh fits of laughter. He was beside himself\nwith satisfaction, for he could see only good results for himself\nin this disaster to his enemy. Now Heidi’s friend would be\nobliged to go away, for she would have no means of going about,\nand when Heidi was alone again she would come out with him as in\nthe old days, and everything would go on in the proper way again.\nBut Peter did not consider, or did not know, that when we do a\nwrong thing trouble is sure to follow.",
        "Heidi now came running out of the hut and round to the shed.\nGrandfather was behind with Clara in his arms. The shed stood\nwide open, the two loose planks having been taken down, and it\nwas quite light inside. Heidi looked into every corner and ran\nfrom one end to the other, and then stood still wondering what\ncould have happened to the chair. Grandfather now came up.",
        "“How is this, have you wheeled the chair away, Heidi?”",
        "“I have been looking everywhere for it, grandfather; you said it\nwas standing ready outside,” and she again searched each corner\nof the shed with her eyes.",
        "At that moment the wind, which had risen suddenly, blew open the\nshed door and sent it banging back against the wall.",
        "“It must have been the wind, grandfather,” exclaimed Heidi, and\nher eyes grew anxious at this sudden discovery. “Oh! if it has\nblown the chair all the way down to Dorfli we shall not get it\nback in time, and shall not be able to go.”",
        "“If it has rolled as far as that it will never come back, for it\nis in a hundred pieces by now,” said the grandfather, going\nround the corner and looking down. “But it’s a curious thing to\nhave happened!” he added as he thought over the matter, for the\nchair would have had to turn a corner before starting down hill.",
        "“Oh, I am sorry,” lamented Clara, “for we shall not be able to\ngo to-day, or perhaps any other day. I shall have to go home, I\nsuppose, if I have no chair. Oh, I am so sorry, I am so sorry!”",
        "But Heidi looked towards her grandfather with her usual\nexpression of confidence.",
        "“Grandfather, you will be able to do something, won’t you, so\nthat it need not be as Clara says, and so that she is not\nobliged to go home?”",
        "“Well, for the present we will go up the mountain as we had\narranged, and then later on we will see what can be done,” he\nanswered, much to the children’s delight.",
        "He went indoors, fetched out a pile of shawls, and laying them\non the sunniest spot he could find set Clara down upon them. Then\nhe fetched the children’s morning milk and had out his two goats.",
        "“Why is Peter not here yet?” thought Uncle to himself, for\nPeter’s whistle had not been sounded that morning. The\ngrandfather now took Clara up on one arm, and the shawls on the\nother.",
        "“Now then we will start,” he said; “the goats can come with us.”",
        "Heidi was pleased at this and walked on after her grandfather\nwith an arm over either of the goats’ necks, and the animals were\nso overjoyed to have her again that they nearly squeezed her flat\nbetween them out of sheer affection. When they reached the spot\nwhere the goats usually pastured they were surprised to find them\nalready feeding there, climbing about the rocks, and Peter with\nthem, lying his full length on the ground.",
        "“I’ll teach you another time to go by like that, you lazy\nrascal! What do you mean by it?” Uncle called to him.",
        "Peter, recognising the voice, jumped up like a shot. “No one was\nup,” he answered.",
        "“Have you seen anything of the chair?” asked the grandfather.",
        "“Of what chair?” called Peter back in answer in a morose tone of\nvoice.",
        "Uncle said no more. He spread the shawls on the sunny slope, and\nsetting Clara upon them asked if she was comfortable.",
        "“As comfortable as in my chair,” she said, thanking him, “and\nthis seems the most beautiful spot. O Heidi, it is lovely, it is\nlovely!” she cried, looking round her with delight.",
        "The grandfather prepared to leave them. They would now be safe\nand happy together, he said, and when it was time for dinner\nHeidi was to go and fetch the bag from the shady hollow where he\nhad put it; Peter was to bring them as much milk as they wanted,\nbut Heidi was to see that it was Little Swan’s milk. He would\ncome and fetch them towards evening; he must now be off to see\nafter the chair and ascertain what had become of it.",
        "The sky was dark blue, and not a single cloud was to be seen\nfrom one horizon to the other. The great snow-field overhead\nsparkled as if set with thousands and thousands of gold and\nsilver stars. The two grey mountains peaks lifted their lofty\nheads against the sky and looked solemnly down upon the valley as\nof old; the great bird was poised aloft in the clear blue air,\nand the mountain wind came over the heights and blew refreshingly\naround the children as they sat on the sunlit slope. It was all\nindescribably enjoyable to Clara and Heidi. Now and again a\nyoung goat came and lay down beside them; Snowflake came\noftenest, putting her little head down near Heidi, and only\nmoving because another goat came and drove her away. Clara had\nlearned to know them all so well that she never mistook one for\nthe other now, for each had an expression and ways of its own.\nAnd the goats had also grown familiar with Clara and would rub\ntheir heads against her shoulder, which was always a sign of\nacquaintanceship and goodwill.",
        "Some hours went by, and Heidi began to think that she might just\ngo over to the spot where all the flowers grew to see if they\nwere fully blown and looking as lovely as the year before. Clara\ncould not go until grandfather came back that evening, when the\nflowers probably would be already closed. The longing to go\nbecame stronger and stronger, till she felt she could not resist\nit.",
        "“Would you think me unkind, Clara,” she said rather\nhesitatingly, “if I left you for a few minutes? I should run\nthere and back very quickly. I want so to see how the flowers are\nlooking–but wait–” for an idea had come into Heidi’s head. She\nran and picked a bunch or two of green leaves, and then took hold\nof Snowflake and led her up to Clara.",
        "“There, now you will not be alone,” said Heidi, giving the goat\na little push to show her she was to lie down near Clara, which\nthe animal quite understood. Heidi threw the leaves into Clara’s\nlap, and the latter told her friend to go at once to look at the\nflowers as she was quite happy to be left with the goat; she\nliked this new experience. Heidi ran off, and Clara began to\nhold out the leaves one by one to Snowflake, who snoozled up to\nher new friend in a confiding manner and slowly ate the leaves\nfrom her hand. It was easy to see that Snowflake enjoyed this\npeaceful and sheltered way of feeding, for when with the other\ngoats she had much persecution to endure from the larger and\nstronger ones of the flock. And Clara found a strange new\npleasure in sitting all alone like this on the mountain side, her\nonly companion a little goat that looked to her for protection.\nShe suddenly felt a great desire to be her own mistress and to be\nable to help others, instead of herself being always dependent as\nshe was now. Many thoughts, unknown to her before, came crowding\ninto her mind, and a longing to go on living in the sunshine, and\nto be doing something that would bring happiness to another, as\nnow she was helping to make the goat happy. An unaccustomed\nfeeling of joy took possession of her, as if everything she had\never known or felt became all at once more beautiful, and she\nseemed to see all things in a new light, and so strong was the\nsense of this new beauty and happiness that she threw her arms\nround the little goat’s neck, and exclaimed, “O Snowflake, how\ndelightful it is up here! if only I could stay on for ever with\nyou beside me!”",
        "Heidi had meanwhile reached her field of flowers, and as she\ncaught sight of it she uttered a cry of joy. The whole ground in\nfront of her was a mass of shimmering gold, where the cistus\nflowers spread their yellow blossoms. Above them waved whole\nbushes of the deep blue bell-flowers; while the fragrance that\narose from the whole sunlit expanse was as if the rarest balsam\nhad been flung over it. The scent, however, came from the small\nbrown flowers, the little round heads of which rose modestly\nhere and there among the yellow blossoms. Heidi stood and gazed\nand drew in the delicious air. Suddenly she turned round and\nreached Clara’s side out of breath with running and excitement.\n\"Oh, you must come,” she called out as soon as she came in sight,\n\"it is more beautiful than you can imagine, and perhaps this\nevening it may not be so lovely. I believe I could carry you,\ndon’t you think I could?” Clara looked at her and shook her head.\n\"Why, Heidi, what can you be thinking of! you are smaller than I\nam. Oh, if only I could walk!”",
        "Heidi looked round as if in search of something, some new idea\nhad evidently come into her head. Peter was sitting up above\nlooking down on the two children. He had been sitting and\nstaring before him in the same way for hours, as if he could not\nmake out what he saw. He had destroyed the chair so that the\nfriend might not be able to move anywhere and that her visit\nmight come to an end, and then a little while after she had\nappeared right up here under his very nose with Heidi beside her.\nHe thought his eyes must deceive him, and yet there she was and\nno mistake about it.",
        "Heidi now looked up to where he was sitting and called out in a\nperemptory voice, “Peter, come down here!”",
        "“I don’t wish to come,” he called in reply.",
        "“But you are to, you must; I cannot do it alone, and you must\ncome here and help me; make haste and come down,” she called\nagain in an urgent voice.",
        "“I shall do nothing of the kind,” was the answer.",
        "Heidi ran some way up the slope towards him, and then pausing\ncalled again, her eyes ablaze with anger, “If you don’t come at\nonce, Peter, I will do something to you that you won’t like; I\nmean what I say.”",
        "Peter felt an inward throe at these words, and a great fear\nseized him. He had done something wicked which he wanted no one\nto know about, and so far he had thought himself safe. But now\nHeidi spoke exactly as if she knew everything, and whatever she\ndid know she would tell her grandfather, and there was no one he\nfeared so much as this latter person. Supposing he were to\nsuspect what had happened about the chair! Peter’s anguish of\nmind grew more acute. He stood up and went down to where Heidi\nwas awaiting him.",
        "“I am coming and you won’t do what you said.”",
        "Peter appeared now so submissive with fear that Heidi felt quite\nsorry for him and answered assuringly, “No, no, of course not;\ncome along with me, there is nothing to be afraid of in what I\nwant you to do.”",
        "As soon as they got to Clara, Heidi gave her orders: Peter was\nto take hold of her under the arms on one side and she on the\nother, and together they were to lift her up. This first movement\nwas successfully carried through, but then came the difficulty.\nAs Clara could not even stand, how were they to support her and\nget her along? Heidi was too small for her arm to serve Clara to\nlean upon.",
        "“You must put one arm well around my neck so, and put the other\nthrough Peter’s and lean firmly upon it, then we shall be able\nto carry you.”",
        "Peter, however, had never given his arm to any one in his life.\nClara put hers in his, but he kept his own hanging down straight\nbeside him like a stick.",
        "“That’s not the way, Peter,” said Heidi in an authoritative\nvoice. “You must put your arm out in the shape of a ring, and\nClara must put hers through it and lean her weight upon you, and\nwhatever you do, don’t let your arm give way; like that. I am\nsure we shall be able to manage.”",
        "Peter did as he was told, but still they did not get on very\nwell. Clara was not such a light weight, and the team did not\nmatch very well in size; it was up one side and down the other,\nso that the supports were rather wobbly.",
        "Clara tried to use her own feet a little, but each time drew\nthem quickly back.",
        "“Put your foot down firmly once,” suggested Heidi, “I am sure it\nwill hurt you less after that.”",
        "“Do you think so?” said Clara hesitatingly, but she followed\nHeidi’s advice and ventured one firm step on the ground and then\nanother; she called out a little as she did it; then she lifted\nher foot again and went on, “Oh, that was less painful already,\"\nshe exclaimed joyfully.",
        "“Try again,” said Heidi encouragingly.",
        "And Clara went on putting one foot out after another until all\nat once she called out, “I can do it, Heidi! look! look! I can\nmake proper steps!” And Heidi cried out with even greater\ndelight, “Can you really make steps, can you really walk? really\nwalk by yourself? Oh, if only grandfather were here!” and she\ncontinued gleefully to exclaim, “You can walk now, Clara, you can\nwalk!”",
        "Clara still held on firmly to her supports, but with every step\nshe felt safer on her feet, as all three became aware, and Heidi\nwas beside herself with joy.",
        "“Now we shall be able to come up here together every day, and go\njust where we like; and you will be able all your life to walk\nabout as I do, and not have to be pushed in a chair, and you\nwill get quite strong and well. It is the greatest happiness we\ncould have had!”",
        "And Clara heartily agreed, for she could think of no greater joy\nin the world than to be strong and able to go about like other\npeople, and no longer to have to lie from day to day in her\ninvalid chair.",
        "They had not far to go to reach the field of flowers, and could\nalready catch sight of the cistus flowers glowing gold in the\nsun. As they came to the bushes of the blue bell flowers, with\nsunny, inviting patches of warm ground between them, Clara said,\n\"Mightn’t we sit down here for a while?”",
        "This was just what Heidi enjoyed, and so the children sat down\nin the midst of the flowers, Clara for the first time on the dry,\nwarm mountain grass, and she found it indescribably delightful.\nAround her were the blue flowers softly waving to and fro, and\nbeyond the gleaming patches of the cistus flowers and the red\ncentaury, while the sweet scent of the brown blossoms and of the\nfragrant prunella enveloped her as she sat. Everything was so\nlovely! so lovely! And Heidi, who was beside her, thought she\nhad never seen it so perfectly beautiful up here before, and she\ndid not know herself why she felt so glad at heart that she\nlonged to shout for joy. Then she suddenly remembered that Clara\nwas cured; that was the crowning delight of all that made life so\ndelightful in the midst of all this surrounding beauty. Clara sat\nsilent, overcome with the enchantment of all that her eye rested\nupon, and with the anticipation of all the happiness that was now\nbefore her. There seemed hardly room in her heart for all her\njoyful emotions, and these and the ecstasy aroused by the\nsunlight and the scent of the flowers, held her dumb.",
        "Peter also lay among the flowers without moving or speaking, for\nhe was fast asleep. The breeze came blowing softly and\ncaressingly from behind the sheltering rocks, and passed\nwhisperingly through the bushes overhead. Heidi got up now and\nthen to run about, for the flowers waving in the warm wind\nseemed to smell sweeter and to grow more thickly whichever way\nshe went, and she felt she must sit down at each fresh spot to\nenjoy the sight and scent. So the hours went by.",
        "It was long past noon when a small troop of goats advanced\nsolemnly towards the plain of flowers. It was not a feeding\nplace of theirs, for they did not care to graze on flowers. They\nlooked like an embassy arriving, with Greenfinch as their leader.\nThey had evidently come in search of their companions who had\nleft them in the lurch, and who had, contrary to all custom,\nremained away so long, for the goats could tell the time without\nmistake. As soon as Greenfinch caught sight of the three missing\nfriends amid the flowers she set up an extra loud bleat,\nwhereupon all the others joined in a chorus of bleats, and the\nwhole company came trotting towards the children. Peter woke up,\nrubbing his eyes, for he had been dreaming that he saw the chair\nagain with its beautiful red padding standing whole and uninjured\nbefore the grandfather’s door, and indeed just as he awoke he\nthought he was looking at the brass-headed nails that studded it\nall round, but it was only the bright yellow flowers beside him.\nHe experienced again a dreadful fear of mind that he had lost in\nthis dream of the uninjured chair. Even though Heidi had promised\nnot to do anything, there still remained the lively dread that\nhis deed might be found out in some other way. He allowed Heidi\nto do what she liked with him, for he was reduced to such a state\nof low spirits and meekness that he was ready to give his help to\nClara without murmur or resistance.",
        "When all three had got back to their old quarters Heidi ran and\nbrought forward the bag, and proceeded to fulfil her promise,\nfor her threat of the morning had been concerned with Peter’s\ndinner. She had seen her grandfather putting in all sorts of good\nthings, and had been pleased to think of Peter having a large\nshare of them, and she had meant him to understand when he\nrefused at first to help her that he would get nothing for his\ndinner, but Peter’s conscience had put another interpretation\nupon her words. Heidi took the food out of the bag and divided it\ninto three portions, and each was of such a goodly size that she\nthought to herself, “There will be plenty of ours left for him to\nhave more still.”",
        "She gave the other two their dinners and sat down with her own\nbeside Clara, and they all three ate with a good appetite after\ntheir great exertions.",
        "It ended as Heidi had expected, and Peter got as much food again\nas his own share with what Clara and Heidi had over from theirs\nafter they had both eaten as much as they wanted. Peter ate up\nevery bit of food to the last crumb, but there was something\nwanting to his usual enjoyment of a good dinner, for every\nmouthful he swallowed seemed to choke him, and he felt something\ngnawing inside him.",
        "They were so late at their dinner that they had not long to wait\nafter they had finished before grandfather came up to fetch them.\nHeidi rushed forward to meet him as soon as he appeared, as she\nwanted to be the first to tell him the good news. She was so\nexcited that she could hardly get her words out when she did get\nup to him, but he soon understood, and a look of extreme pleasure\ncame into his face. He hastened up to where Clara was sitting and\nsaid with a cheerful smile, “So we’ve made the effort, have we,\nand won the day!”",
        "Then he lifted her up, and putting his left arm behind her and\ngiving her his right to lean upon, made her walk a little way,\nwhich she did with less trembling and hesitation than before now\nthat she had such a strong arm round her.",
        "Heidi skipped along beside her in triumphant glee, and the\ngrandfather looked too as if some happiness had befallen him.\nBut now he took Clara up in his arms. “We must not overdo it,\"\nhe said, “and it is high time we went home,” and he started off\ndown the mountain path, for he was anxious to get her indoors\nthat she might rest after her unusual fatigue.",
        "When Peter got to Dorfli that evening he found a large group of\npeople collected round a certain spot, pushing one another and\nlooking over each other’s shoulders in their eagerness to catch\nsight of something lying on the ground. Peter thought he should\nlike to see too, and poked and elbowed till he made his way\nthrough.",
        "There it lay, the thing he had wanted to see. Scattered about\nthe grass were the remains of Clara’s chair; part of the back and\nthe middle bit, and enough of the red padding and the bright\nnails to show how magnificent the chair had been when it was\nentire.",
        "“I was here when the men passed carrying it up,” said the baker\nwho was standing near Peter. “I’ll bet any one that it was worth\ntwenty-five pounds at least. I cannot think how such an accident\ncould have happened.”",
        "“Uncle said the wind might perhaps have done it,” remarked one\nof the women, who could not sufficiently admire the red\nupholstery.",
        "“It’s a good job that no one but the wind did it,” said the\nbaker again, “or he might smart for it! No doubt the gentleman in\nFrankfurt when he hears what has happened will make all\ninquiries about it. I am glad for myself that I have not been\nseen up the mountain for a good two years, as suspicion is likely\nto fall on any one who was about up there at the time.”",
        "Many more opinions were passed on the matter, but Peter had\nheard enough. He crept quietly away out of the crowd and then\ntook to his heels and ran up home as fast as he could, as if he\nthought some one was after him. The baker’s words had filled him\nwith fear and trembling. He was sure now that any day a constable\nmight come over from Frankfurt and inquire about the destruction\nof the chair, and then everything would come out, and he would\nbe seized and carried off to Frankfurt and there put in prison.\nThe whole picture of what was coming was clear before him, and\nhis hair stood on end with terror.",
        "He reached home in this disturbed state of mind. He would not\nopen his mouth in reply to anything that was said to him; he\nwould not eat his potatoes; all he did was to creep off to bed\nas quickly as possible and hide under the bedclothes and groan.",
        "“Peter has been eating sorrel again, and is evidently in pain by\nthe way he is groaning,” said Brigitta.",
        "“You must give him a little more bread to take with him; give\nhim a bit of mine to-morrow,” said the grandmother sympathisingly.",
        "As the children lay that night in bed looking out at the stars\nHeidi said, “I have been thinking all day what a happy thing it\nis that God does not give us what we ask for, even when we pray\nand pray and pray, if He knows there is something better for us;\nhave you felt like that?”",
        "“Why do you ask me that to-night all of a sudden?” asked Clara.",
        "“Because I prayed so hard when I was in Frankfurt that I might\ngo home at once, and because I was not allowed to I thought God\nhad forgotten me. And now you see, if I had come away at first\nwhen I wanted to, you would never have come here, and would never\nhave got well.”",
        "Clara had in her turn become thoughtful. “But, Heidi,” she began\nagain, “in that case we ought never to pray for anything, as God\nalways intends something better for us than we know or wish\nfor.”",
        "“You must not think it is like that, Clara,” replied Heidi\neagerly. “We must go on praying for everything, for everything,\nso that God may know we do not forget that it all comes from\nHim. If we forget God, then He lets us go our own way and we get\ninto trouble; grandmamma told me so. And if He does not give us\nwhat we ask for we must not think that He has not heard us and\nleave off praying, but we must still pray and say, I am sure,\ndear God, that Thou art keeping something better for me, and I\nwill not be unhappy, for I know that Thou wilt make everything\nright in the end.”",
        "“How did you learn all that?” asked Clara.",
        "“Grandmamma explained it to me first of all, and then when it\nall happened just as she said, I knew it myself, and I think,\nClara,” she went on, as she sat up in bed, “we ought certainly to\nthank God to-night that you can walk now, and that He has made us\nso happy.”",
        "“Yes, Heidi, I am sure you are right, and I am glad you reminded\nme; I almost forgot my prayers for very joy.”",
        "Both children said their prayers, and each thanked God in her\nown way for the blessing He had bestowed on Clara, who had for so\nlong lain weak and ill.",
        "The next morning the grandfather suggested that they should now\nwrite to the grandmamma and ask her if she would not come and\npay them a visit, as they had something new to show her. But the\nchildren had another plan in their heads, for they wanted to\nprepare a great surprise for grandmamma. Clara was first to have\nmore practice in walking so that she might be able to go a\nlittle way by herself; above all things grandmamma was not to\nhave a hint of it. They asked the grandfather how long he thought\nthis would take, and when he told them about a week or less, they\nimmediately sat down and wrote a pressing invitation to\ngrandmamma, asking her to come soon, but no word was said about\nthere being anything new to see.",
        "The following days were some of the most joyous that Clara had\nspent on the mountain. She awoke each morning with a happy voice\nwithin her crying, “I am well now! I am well now! I shan’t have\nto go about in a chair, I can walk by myself like other people.”",
        "Then came the walking, and every day she found it easier and was\nable to go a longer distance. The movement gave her such an\nappetite that the grandfather cut his bread and butter a little\nthicker each day, and was well pleased to see it disappear. He\nnow brought out with it a large jugful of the foaming milk and\nfilled her little bowl over and over again. And so another week\nwent by and the day came which was to bring grandmamma up the\nmountain for her second visit.",
        "Grandmamma wrote the day before her arrival to let the children\nknow that they might expect her without fail. Peter brought up\nthe letter early the following morning. Grandfather and the\nchildren were already outside and the goats were awaiting him,\nshaking their heads frolicsomely in the fresh morning air, while\nthe children stroked them and wished them a pleasant journey up\nthe mountain. Uncle stood near, looking now at the fresh faces\nof the children, now at his well-kept goats, with a smile on his\nface, evidently well pleased with the sight of both.",
        "As Peter neared the group his steps slackened, and the instant\nhe had handed the letter to Uncle he turned quickly away as if\nfrightened, and as he went he gave a hasty glance behind him, as\nif the thing he feared was pursuing him, and then he gave a leap\nand ran off up the mountain.",
        "“Grandfather,” said Heidi, who had been watching him with\nastonished eyes, “why does Peter always behave now like the\nGreat Turk when he thinks somebody is after him with a stick; he\nturns and shakes his head and goes off with a bound just like\nthat?”",
        "“Perhaps Peter fancies he sees the stick which he so well\ndeserves coming after him,” answered grandfather.",
        "Peter ran up the first slope without a pause; when he was well\nout of sight, however, he stood still and looked suspiciously\nabout him. Suddenly he gave a jump and looked behind him with a\nterrified expression, as if some one had caught hold of him by\nthe nape of the neck; for Peter expected every minute that the\npolice-constable from Frankfurt would leap out upon him from\nbehind some bush or hedge. The longer his suspense lasted, the\nmore frightened and miserable he became; he did not know a\nmoment’s peace.",
        "Heidi now set about tidying the hut, as grandmamma must find\neverything clean and in good order when she arrived.",
        "Clara looked on amused and interested to watch the busy Heidi at\nher work.",
        "So the morning soon went by, and grandmamma might now be\nexpected at any minute. The children dressed themselves and went\nand sat together outside on the seat ready to receive her.",
        "Grandfather joined them, that they might see the splendid bunch\nof blue gentians which he had been up the mountain to gather,\nand the children exclaimed with delight at the beauty of the\nflowers as they shone in the morning sun. The grandfather then\ncarried them indoors. Heidi jumped up from time to time to see if\nthere was any sign of grandmamma’s approach.",
        "At last she saw the procession winding up the mountain just in\nthe order she had expected. First there was the guide, then the\nwhite horse with grandmamma mounted upon it, and last of all the\nporter with a heavy bundle on his back, for grandmamma would not\nthink of going up the mountain without a full supply of wraps\nand rugs.",
        "Nearer and nearer wound the procession; at last it reached the\ntop and grandmamma was there looking down on the children from\nher horse. She no sooner saw them, however, sitting side by\nside, than she began quickly dismounting, as she cried out in a\nshocked tone of voice, “Why is this? why are you not lying in\nyour chair, Clara? What are you all thinking about?” But even\nbefore she had got close to them she threw up her hands in\nastonishment, exclaiming further, “Is it really you, dear child?\nWhy, your cheeks have grown quite round and rosy! I should hardly\nhave known you again!” And she was hastening forward to embrace\nher, when Heidi slipped down from the seat, and Clara leaning on\nher shoulder, the two children began walking along quite coolly\nand naturally. Then indeed grandmamma was surprised, or rather\nalarmed, for she thought at first that it must be some unheard-\nof proceeding of Heidi’s devising.",
        "But no–Clara was actually walking steadily and uprightly beside\nHeidi–and now the two children turned and came towards her with\nbeaming faces and rosy cheeks. Laughing and crying she ran to\nthem and embraced first Clara and then Heidi, and then Clara\nagain, unable to speak for joy. All at once she caught sight of\nUncle standing by the seat and looking on smiling at the\nmeeting. She took Clara’s arm in hers, and with continual\nexpressions of delight at the fact that the child could now\nreally walk about with her, she went up to the old man, and then\nletting go Clara’s arm she seized his hands.",
        "“My dear Uncle! my dear Uncle! how much we have to thank you\nfor! It is all your doing! it is your caring and nursing––”",
        "“And God’s good sun and mountain air,” he interrupted her,\nsmiling.",
        "“Yes, and don’t forget the beautiful milk I have,” put in Clara.\n\"Grandmamma, you can’t think what a quantity of goat’s milk I\ndrink, and how nice it is!”",
        "“I can see that by your cheeks, child,” answered grandmamma. “I\nreally should not have known you; you have grown quite strong\nand plump, and taller too; I never hoped or expected to see you\nlook like that. I cannot take my eyes off you, for I can hardly\nyet believe it. But now I must telegraph without delay to my son\nin Paris, and tell him he must come here at once. I shall not say\nwhy; it will be the greatest happiness he has ever known. My\ndear Uncle, how can I send a telegram; have you dismissed the men\nyet?”",
        "“They have gone,” he answered, “but if you are in a hurry I will\nfetch Peter, and he can take it for you.”",
        "Grandmamma thanked him, for she was anxious that the good news\nshould not be kept from her son a day longer than was possible.",
        "So Uncle went aside a little way and blew such a resounding\nwhistle through his fingers that he awoke a responsive echo\namong the rocks far overhead. He had not to wait many minutes\nbefore Peter came running down in answer, for he knew the sound\nof Uncle’s whistle. Peter arrived, looking as white as a ghost,\nfor he quite thought Uncle was sending for him to give him up.\nBut as it was he only had a written paper given him with\ninstructions to take it down at once to the post-office at\nDorfli; Uncle would settle for the payment later, as it was not\nsafe to give Peter too much to look after.",
        "Peter went off with the paper in his hand, feeling some relief\nof mind for the present, for as Uncle had not whistled for him in\norder to give him up it was evident that no policeman had yet\narrived.",
        "So now they could all sit down in peace to their dinner round\nthe table in front of the hut, and grandmamma was given a\ndetailed account of all that had taken place. How grandfather had\nmade Clara try first to stand and then to move her feet a little\nevery day, and how they had settled for the day’s excursion up\nthe mountain and the chair had been blown away. How Clara’s\ndesire to see the flowers had induced her to take the first walk,\nand so by degrees one thing had led to another. The recital took\nsome time, for grandmamma continually interrupted it with fresh\nexclamations of surprise and thankfulness: “It hardly seems\npossible! I can scarcely believe it is not all a dream! Are we\nreally awake, and are all sitting here by the mountain hut, and\nis that round-faced, healthy-looking child my poor little, white,\nsickly Clara?”",
        "And Clara and Heidi could not get over their delight at the\nsuccess of the surprise they had so carefully arranged for\ngrandmamma and at the latter’s continued astonishment.",
        "Meanwhile Herr Sesemann, who had finished his business in Paris,\nhad also been preparing a surprise. Without saying a word to his\nmother he got into the train one sunny morning and travelled\nthat day to Basle; the next morning he continued his journey, for\na great longing had seized him to see his little daughter from\nwhom he had been separated the whole summer. He arrived at Ragatz\na few hours after his mother had left. When he heard that she had\nthat very day started for the mountain, he immediately hired a\ncarriage and drove off to Mayenfeld; here he found that he could\nif he liked drive on as far as Dorfli, which he did, as he\nthought the walk up from that place would be as long as he cared\nfor.",
        "Herr Sesemann found he was right, for the climb up the mountain,\nas it was, proved long and fatiguing to him. He went on and on,\nbut still no hut came in sight, and yet he knew there was one\nwhere Peter lived half way up, for the path had been described\nto him over and over again.",
        "There were traces of climbers to be seen on all sides; the\nnarrow footpaths seemed to run in every direction, and Herr\nSesemann began to wonder if he was on the right one, and whether\nthe hut lay perhaps on the other side of the mountain. He looked\nround to see if any one was in sight of whom he could ask the\nway; but far and wide there was not a soul to be seen or a sound\nto be heard. Only at moments the mountain wind whistled through\nthe air, and the insects hummed in the sunshine or a happy bird\nsang out from the branches of a solitary larch tree. Herr\nSesemann stood still for a while to let the cool Alpine wind blow\non his hot face. But now some one came running down the mountain-\nside–it was Peter with the telegram in his hand. He ran straight\ndown the steep slope, not following the path on which Herr\nSesemann was standing. As soon as the latter caught sight of him\nhe beckoned to him to come. Peter advanced towards him slowly and\ntimidly, with a sort of sidelong movement, as if he could only\nmove one leg properly and had to drag the other after him. “Hurry\nup, lad,” called Herr Sesemann, and when Peter was near enough,\n\"Tell me,” he said, “is this the way to the hut where the old man\nand the child Heidi live, and where the visitors from Frankfurt\nare staying?”",
        "A low sound of fear was the only answer he received, as Peter\nturned to run away in such precipitous haste that he fell head\nover heels several times, and went rolling and bumping down the\nslope in involuntary bounds, just in the same way as the chair,\nonly that Peter fortunately did not fall to pieces as that had\ndone. Only the telegram came to grief, and that was torn into\nfragments and flew away.",
        "“How extraordinarily timid these mountain dwellers are!” thought\nHerr Sesemann to himself, for he quite believed that it was the\nsight of a stranger that had made such an impression on this\nunsophisticated child of the mountains.",
        "After watching Peter’s violent descent towards the valley for a\nfew minutes he continued his journey.",
        "Peter, meanwhile, with all his efforts, could not stop himself,\nbut went rolling on, and still tumbling head over heels at\nintervals in a most remarkable manner.",
        "But this was not the most terrible part of his sufferings at the\nmoment, for far worse was the fear and horror that possessed\nhim, feeling sure, as he did now, that the policeman had really\ncome over for him from Frankfurt. He had no doubt at all that the\nstranger who had asked him the way was the very man himself.\nJust as he had rolled to the edge of that last high slope above\nDorfli he was caught in a bush, and at last able to keep himself\nfrom falling any farther. He lay still for a second or two to\nrecover himself, and to think over matters.",
        "“Well done! another of you come bumping along like this!” said a\nvoice close to Peter, “and which of you to-morrow is the wind\ngoing to send rolling down like a badly-sewn sack of potatoes?\"\nIt was the baker, who stood there laughing. He had been\nstrolling out to refresh himself after his hot day’s work, and\nhad watched with amusement as he saw Peter come rolling over and\nover in much the same way as the chair.",
        "Peter was on his feet in a moment. He had received a fresh\nshock. Without once looking behind him he began hurrying up the\nslope again. He would have liked best to go home and creep into\nbed, so as to hide himself, for he felt safest when there. But he\nhad left the goats up above, and Uncle had given him strict\ninjunctions to make haste back so that they might not be left\ntoo long alone. And he stood more in awe of Uncle than any one,\nand would not have dared to disobey him on any account. There was\nno help for it, he had to go back, and Peter went on groaning and\nlimping. He could run no more, for the anguish of mind he had\nbeen through, and the bumping and shaking he had received, were\nbeginning to tell upon him. And so with lagging steps and groans\nhe slowly made his way up the mountain.",
        "Shortly after meeting Peter, Herr Sesemann passed the first hut,\nand so was satisfied that he was on the right path. He continued\nhis climb with renewed courage, and at last, after a long and\nexhausting walk, he came in sight of his goal. There, only a\nlittle distance farther up, stood the grandfather’s home, with\nthe dark tops of the fir trees waving above its roof.",
        "Herr Sesemann was delighted to have come to the last steep bit\nof his journey, in another minute or two he would be with his\nlittle daughter, and he pleased himself with the thought of her\nsurprise. But the company above had seen his approaching figure\nand recognized who it was, and they were preparing something he\nlittle expected as a surprise on their part.",
        "As he stepped on to the space in front of the hut two figures\ncame towards him. One a tall girl with fair hair and pink cheeks,\nleaning on Heidi, whose dark eyes were dancing with joy. Herr\nSesemann suddenly stopped, staring at the two children, and all\nat once the tears started to his eyes. What memories arose in his\nheart! Just so had Clara’s mother looked, the fair-haired girl\nwith the delicate pink-and-white complexion. Herr Sesemann did\nnot know if he was awake or dreaming.",
        "“Don’t you know me, papa?” called Clara to him, her face beaming\nwith happiness. “Am I so altered since you saw me?”",
        "Then Herr Sesemann ran to his child and clasped her in his arms.",
        "“Yes, you are indeed altered! How is it possible? Is it true\nwhat I see?” And the delighted father stepped back to look full\nat her again, and to make sure that the picture would not vanish\nbefore his eyes.",
        "“Are you my little Clara, really my little Clara?” he kept on\nsaying, then he clasped her in his arms again, and again put her\naway from him that he might look and make sure it was she who\nstood before him.",
        "And now grandmamma came up, anxious for a sight of her son’s\nhappy face.",
        "“Well, what do you say now, dear son?” she exclaimed. “You have\ngiven us a pleasant surprise, but it is nothing in comparison to\nwhat we have prepared for you, you must confess,” and she gave\nher son an affectionate kiss as she spoke. “But now,” she went\non, “you must come and pay your respects to Uncle, who is our\nchief benefactor.”",
        "“Yes, indeed, and with the little inmate of our own house, our\nlittle Heidi, too,” said Herr Sesemann, shaking Heidi by the\nhand. “Well? are you still well and happy in your mountain home?\nbut I need not ask, no Alpine rose could look more blooming. I\nam glad, child, it is a pleasure to me to see you so.”",
        "And Heidi looked up with equal pleasure into Herr Sesemann’s\nkind face. How good he had always been to her! And that he should\nfind such happiness awaiting him up here on the mountain made her\nheart beat with gladness.",
        "Grandmamma now led her son to introduce him to Uncle, and while\nthe two men were shaking hands and Herr Sesemann was expressing\nhis heartfelt thanks and boundless astonishment to the old man,\ngrandmamma wandered round to the back to see the old fir trees\nagain.",
        "Here another unexpected sight met her gaze, for there, under the\ntrees where the long branches had left a clear space on the\nground, stood a great bush of the most wonderful dark blue\ngentians, as fresh and shining as if they were growing on the\nspot. She clasped her hands, enraptured with their beauty.",
        "“How exquisite! what a lovely sight!” she exclaimed. “Heidi,\ndearest child, come here! Is it you who have prepared this\npleasure for me? It is perfectly wonderful!”",
        "The children ran up.",
        "“No, no, I did not put them there,” said Heidi, “but I know who\ndid.”",
        "“They grow just like that on the mountain, grandmamma, only if\nanything they look more beautiful still,” Clara put in; “but\nguess who brought those down to-day,” and as she spoke she gave\nsuch a pleased smile that the grandmother thought for a moment\nthe child herself must have gathered them. But that was hardly\npossible.",
        "At this moment a slight rustling was heard behind the fir trees.\nIt was Peter, who had just arrived. He had made a long round,\nhaving seen from the distance who it was standing beside Uncle\nin front of the hut, and he was trying to slip by unobserved. But\ngrandmamma had seen and recognized him, and suddenly the thought\nstruck her that it might be Peter who had brought the flowers\nand that he was now trying to get away unseen, feeling shy about\nit; but she could not let him go off like that, he must have some\nlittle reward.",
        "“Come along, boy; come here, do not be afraid,” she called to\nhim.",
        "Peter stood still, petrified with fear. After all he had gone\nthrough that day he felt he had no longer any power of\nresistance left. All he could think was, “It’s all up with me\nnow.” Every hair of his head stood on end, and he stepped forth\nfrom behind the fir trees, his face pale and distorted with\nterror.",
        "“Courage, boy,” said grandmamma in her effort to dispel his\nshyness, “tell me now straight out without hesitation, was it\nyou who did it?”",
        "Peter did not lift his eyes and therefore did not see at what\ngrandmamma was pointing. But he knew that Uncle was standing at\nthe corner of the hut, fixing him with his grey eyes, while\nbeside him stood the most terrible person that Peter could\nconceive–the police-constable from Frankfurt. Quaking in every\nlimb, and with trembling lips he muttered a low, “Yes.”",
        "“Well, and what is there dreadful about that?” said grandmamma.",
        "“Because–because–it is all broken to pieces and no one can put\nit together again.” Peter brought out his words with difficulty,\nand his knees knocked together so that he could hardly stand.",
        "Grandmamma went up to Uncle. “Is that poor boy a little out of\nhis mind?” she asked sympathisingly.",
        "“Not in the least,” Uncle assured her, “it is only that he was\nthe wind that sent the chair rolling down the slope, and he is\nexpecting his well-deserved punishment.”",
        "Grandmamma found this hard to believe, for in her opinion Peter\ndid not look an entirely bad boy, nor could he have any reason\nfor destroying such a necessary thing as the chair. But Uncle\nhad only given expression to the suspicion that he had from the\nmoment the accident happened. The angry looks which Peter had\nfrom the beginning cast at Clara, and the other signs of his\ndislike to what had been taking place on the mountain, had not\nescaped Uncle’s eye. Putting two and two together he had come to\nthe right conclusion as to the cause of the disaster, and he\ntherefore spoke without hesitation when he accused Peter. The\nlady broke into lively expostulations on hearing this.",
        "“No, no, dear Uncle, we will not punish the poor boy any\nfurther. One must be fair to him. Here are all these strangers\nfrom Frankfurt who come and carry away Heidi, his one sole\npossession, and a possession well worth having too, and he is\nleft to sit alone day after day for weeks, with nothing to do but\nbrood over his wrongs. No, no, let us be fair to him; his anger\ngot the upper hand and drove him an act of revenge–a foolish\none, I own, but then we all behave foolishly when we are angry.\"\nAnd saying this she went back to Peter, who still stood\nfrightened and trembling. She sat down on the seat under the fir\ntrees and called him to her kindly,–",
        "“Come here, boy, and stand in front of me, for I have something\nto say to you. Leave off shaking and trembling, for I want you\nto listen to me. You sent the chair rolling down the mountain so\nthat it was broken to pieces. That was a very wrong thing to do,\nas you yourself knew very well at the time, and you also knew\nthat you deserved to be punished for it, and in order to escape\nthis you have been doing all you can to hide the truth from\neverybody. But be sure of this, Peter: that those who do wrong\nmake a mistake when they think no one knows anything about it.\nFor God sees and hears everything, and when the wicked doer\ntries to hide what he has done, then God wakes up a little\nwatchman that He places inside us all when we are born and who\nsleeps on quietly till we do something wrong. And the little\nwatchman has a small goad in his hand, And when he wakes up he\nkeeps on pricking us with it, so that we have not a moment’s\npeace. And the watchman torments us still further, for he keeps\non calling out, ’Now you will be found out! Now they will drag\nyou off to punishment!’ And so we pass our life in fear and\ntrouble, and never know a moment’s happiness or peace. Have you\nnot felt something like that lately, Peter?”",
        "Peter gave a contrite nod of the head, as one who knew all about\nit, for grandmamma had described his own feelings exactly.",
        "“And you calculated wrongly also in another way,” continued\ngrandmamma, “for you see the harm you intended has turned out\nfor the best for those you wished to hurt. As Clara had no chair\nto go in and yet wanted so much to see the flowers, she made the\neffort to walk, and every day since she has been walking better\nand better, and if she remains up here she will in time be able\nto go up the mountain every day, much oftener than she would\nhave done in her chair. So you see, Peter, God is able to bring\ngood out of evil for those whom you meant to injure, and you who\ndid the evil were left to suffer the unhappy consequences of it.\nDo you thoroughly understand all I have said to you, Peter? If\nso, do not forget my words, and whenever you feel inclined to do\nanything wrong, think of the little watchman inside you with his\ngoad and his disagreeable voice. Will you remember all this?”",
        "“Yes, I will,” answered Peter, still very subdued, for he did\nnot yet know how the matter was going to end, as the police\nconstable was still standing with the Uncle.",
        "“That’s right, and now the thing is over and done for,” said\ngrandmamma. “But I should like you to have something for a\npleasant reminder of the visitors from Frankfurt. Can you tell\nme anything that you have wished very much to have? What would\nyou like best as a present?”",
        "Peter lifted his head at this, and stared open-eyed at\ngrandmamma. Up to the last minute he had been expecting\nsomething dreadful to happen, and now he might have anything that\nhe wanted. His mind seemed all of a whirl.",
        "“I mean what I say,” went on grandmamma. “You shall choose what\nyou would like to have as a remembrance from the Frankfurt\nvisitors, and as a token that they will not think any more of\nthe wrong thing you did. Now do you understand me, boy?”",
        "The fact began at last to dawn upon Peter’s mind that he had no\nfurther punishment to fear, and that the kind lady sitting in\nfront of him had delivered him from the police constable. He\nsuddenly felt as if the weight of a mountain had fallen off him.\nHe had also by this time awakened to the further conviction that\nit was better to make a full confession at once of anything he\nhad done wrong or had left undone, and so he said, “And I lost\nthe paper, too.”",
        "Grandmamma had to consider a moment what he meant, but soon\nrecalled his connection with her telegram, and answered kindly,–",
        "“You are a good boy to tell me! Never conceal anything you have\ndone wrong, and then all will come right again. And now what\nwould you like me to give you?”",
        "Peter grew almost giddy with the thought that he could have\nanything in the world that he wished for. He had a vision of the\nyearly fair at Mayenfeld with the glittering stalls and all the\nlovely things that he had stood gazing at for hours, without a\nhope of ever possessing one of them, for Peter’s purse never\nheld more than a halfpenny, and all these fascinating objects\ncost double that amount. There were the pretty little red\nwhistles that he could use to call his goats, and the splendid\nknives with rounded handles, known as toad-strikers, with which\none could do such famous work among the hazel bushes.",
        "Peter remained pondering; he was trying to think which of these\ntwo desirable objects he should best like to have, and he found\nit difficult to decide. Then a bright thought occurred to him;\nhe would then be able to think over the matter between now and\nnext year’s fair.",
        "“A penny,” answered Peter, who was no longer in doubt.",
        "Grandmamma could not help laughing. “That is not an extravagant\nrequest. Come here then!” and she pulled out her purse and put\nfour bright round shillings in his hand and, then laid some\npennies on top of it. “We will settle our accounts at once,” she\ncontinued, “and I will explain them to you. I have given you as\nmany pennies as there are weeks in the year, and so every Sunday\nthroughout the year you can take out a penny to spend.”",
        "“As long as I live?” said Peter quite innocently.",
        "Grandmamma laughed more still at this, and the men hearing her,\npaused in their talk to listen to what was going on.",
        "“Yes, boy, you shall have it all your life–I will put it down\nin my will. Do you hear, my son? and you are to put it down in\nyours as well: a penny a week to Peter as long as he lives.”",
        "Herr Sesemann nodded his assent and joined in the laughter.",
        "Peter looked again at the present in his hand to make sure he\nwas not dreaming, and then said, “Thank God!”",
        "And he went off running and leaping with more even than his\nusual agility, and this time managed to keep his feet, for it was\nnot fear, but joy such as he had never known before in his life,\nthat now sent him flying up the mountain. All trouble and\ntrembling had disappeared, and he was to have a penny every week\nfor life.",
        "As later, after dinner, the party were sitting together\nchatting, Clara drew her father a little aside, and said with an\neagerness that had been unknown to the little tired invalid,–",
        "“O papa, if you only knew all that grandfather has done for me\nfrom day to day! I cannot reckon his kindnesses, but I shall\nnever forget them as long as I live! And I keep on thinking what\nI could do for him, or what present I could make him that would\ngive him half as much pleasure as he has given me.”",
        "“That is just what I wish most myself, Clara,” replied her\nfather, whose face grew happier each time he looked at his\nlittle daughter. “I have been also thinking how we can best show\nour gratitude to our good benefactor.”",
        "Herr Sesemann now went over to where Uncle and grandmamma were\nengaged in lively conversation. Uncle stood up as he approached,\nand Herr Sesemann, taking him by the hand said,–",
        "“Dear friend, let us exchange a few words with one another. You\nwill believe me when I tell you that I have known no real\nhappiness for years past. What worth to me were money and\nproperty when they were unable to make my poor child well and\nhappy? With the help of God you have made her whole and strong,\nand you have given new life not only to her but to me. Tell me\nnow, in what way can I show my gratitude to you? I can never\nrepay all you have done, but whatever is in my power to do is at\nyour service. Speak, friend, and tell me what I can do?”",
        "Uncle had listened to him quietly, with a smile of pleasure on\nhis face as he looked at the happy father.",
        "“Herr Sesemann,” he replied in his dignified way, “believe me\nthat I too have my share in the joy of your daughter’s recovery,\nand my trouble is well repaid by it. I thank you heartily for\nall you have said, but I have need of nothing; I have enough for\nmyself and the child as long as I live. One wish alone I have,\nand if that could be satisfied I should have no further care in\nlife.”",
        "“Speak, dear friend, and tell me what it is,” said Herr Sesemann\nentreatingly.",
        "“I am growing old,” Uncle went on, “and shall not be here much\nlonger. I have nothing to leave the child when I die, and she\nhas no relations, except one person who will always like to make\nwhat profit out of her she can. If you could promise me that\nHeidi shall never have to go and earn her living among strangers,\nthen you would richly reward me for all I have done for your\nchild.”",
        "“There could never be any question of such a thing as that, my\ndear friend,” said Herr Sesemann quickly. “I look upon the child\nas our own. Ask my mother, my daughter; you may be sure that\nthey will never allow the child to be left in any one else’s\ncare! But if it will make you happier I give you here my hand\nupon it. I promise you: Heidi shall never have to go and earn her\nliving among strangers; I will make provision against this both\nduring my life and after. But now I have something else to say.\nIndependent of her circumstances, the child is totally unfitted\nto live a life away from home; we found out that when she was\nwith us. But she has made friends, and among them I know one who\nis at this moment in Frankfurt; he is winding up his affairs\nthere, that he may be free to go where he likes and take his\nrest. I am speaking of my friend, the doctor, who came over here\nin the autumn and who, having well considered your advice,\nintends to settle in this neighborhood, for he has never felt so\nwell and happy anywhere as in the company of you and Heidi. So\nyou see the child will henceforth have two protectors near her–\nand may they both live long to share the task!”",
        "“God grant it indeed may be so!” added grandmamma, shaking\nUncle’s hand warmly as she spoke, to show how sincerely she\nechoed her son’s wish. Then putting her arm round Heidi, who was\nstanding near, she drew the child to her.",
        "“And I have a question to ask you too, dear Heidi. Tell me if\nthere is anything you particularly wish for.”",
        "“Yes, there is,” answered Heidi promptly, looking up delightedly\nat grandmamma.",
        "“Then tell me at once, dear, what it is.”",
        "“I want to have the bed I slept in at Frankfurt with the high\npillows and the thick coverlid, and then grandmother will not\nhave to lie with her head down hill and hardly able to breathe,\nand she will be warm enough under the coverlid not to have to\nwear her shawl in bed to prevent her freezing to death.”",
        "In her eagerness to obtain what she had set her heart upon Heidi\nhardly gave herself time to get out all she had to say, and did\nnot pause for breath till she reached the end of her sentence.",
        "“Dearest child,” answered grandmamma, moved by Heidi’s speech,\n\"what is this you tell me of grandmother! You are right to\nremind me. In the midst of our own happiness we forget too often\nthat which we ought to remember before all things. When God has\nshown us some special mercy we should think at once of those who\nare denied so many things. I will telegraph to Frankfurt at once!\nFraulein Rottenmeier shall pack up the bed this very day, and it\nwill be here in two days’ time. God willing, grandmother shall\nsoon be sleeping comfortably upon it.”",
        "Heidi skipped round grandmamma in her glee, and then stopping\nall of a sudden, said quickly, “I must make haste down and tell\ngrandmother, and she will be in trouble too at my not having\nbeen to see her for such a long time.” For she felt she could not\nwait another moment before carrying the good news down to\ngrandmother, and, moreover, the recollection came to her of the\ndistress the old woman was in when she last saw her.",
        "“No, no, Heidi, what can you be thinking of,” said her\ngrandfather reprovingly. “You can’t be running backwards and\nforwards like that when you have visitors.”",
        "But grandmamma interfered on Heidi’s behalf. “The child is not\nso far wrong, Uncle,” she said, “and poor grandmother has too\nlong been deprived of Heidi for our sakes. Let us all go down to\nher together. I believe my horse is waiting for me and I can ride\ndown from there, and as soon as I get to Dorfli the message\nshall be sent off. What do you think of my plan, son?”",
        "Herr Sesemann had not yet had time to speak of his travelling\nplans, so he begged his mother to wait a few moments that he\nmight tell her what he proposed doing.",
        "Herr Sesemann had been arranging that he and his mother should\nmake a little tour in Switzerland, first ascertaining if Clara\nwas in a fit state to go some part of the way with them. But now\nhe would have the full enjoyment of his daughter’s company, and\nthat being so he did not want to miss any of these beautiful\ndays of later summer, but to start at once on the journey that he\nnow looked forward to with such additional pleasure. And so he\nproposed that they should spend the night in Dorfli and that\nnext day he should come and fetch Clara, then they would all\nthree go down to Ragatz and make that their starting point.",
        "Clara was rather upset at first at the thought of saying good-\nbye like this to the mountain; she could not help being pleased,\nhowever, at the prospect of the journey, and no time was allowed\nher to give way to lamentation.",
        "Grandmamma had already taken Heidi by the hand, preparatory to\nleading the way, when she suddenly turned. “But what is to\nbecome of Clara?” she asked, remembering all at once that the\nchild could not yet take so long a walk. She gave a nod of\nsatisfaction as she saw that Uncle had already taken Clara up in\nhis arms and was following her with sturdy strides. Herr Sesemann\nbrought up the rear, and so they all started down the mountain.",
        "Heidi kept jumping for joy as she and grandmamma walked along\nside by side, and grandmamma asked all about grandmother, how\nshe lived, and what she did, especially in the winter when it was\nso cold. And Heidi gave her a minute account of everything, for\nshe knew all that went on at grandmother’s, and told her how\ngrandmother sat crouching in her corner and trembling with cold.\nShe was able to give her exact particulars of what grandmother\nhad and had not to eat. Grandmamma listened with interest and\nsympathy until they came to Grandmother’s. Brigitta was just\nhanging out Peter’s second shirt in the sun, so that he might\nhave it ready to put on when he had worn the other long enough.\nAs soon as she saw the company approaching she rushed indoors.",
        "“The whole party of them are just going past, mother, evidently\nall returning home again,” she informed the old woman. “Uncle is\nwith them, carrying the sick child.”",
        "“Alas, is it really to be so then?” sighed the grandmother. “And\nyou saw Heidi with them? Then they are taking her away. If only\nshe could come and put her hand in mine again! If I could but\nhear her voice once more!”",
        "At this moment the door flew open and Heidi sprang across to the\ncorner and threw her arms round grandmother.",
        "“Grandmother! grandmother! my bed is to be sent from Frankfurt\nwith all the three pillows and the thick coverlid; grandmamma\nsays it will be here in two days.” Heidi could not get out her\nwords quickly enough, for she was impatient to see grandmother’s\ngreat joy at the news. The latter smiled, but said a little\nsadly,–",
        "“She must indeed be a good kind lady, and I ought to be glad to\nthink she is taking you with her, but I shall not outlive it\nlong.”",
        "“What is this I hear? Who has been telling my good grandmother\nsuch tales?” exclaimed a kindly voice, and grandmother felt her\nhand taken and warmly pressed, for grandmamma had followed Heidi\nin and heard all that was said. “No, no, there is no thought of\nsuch a thing! Heidi is going to stay with you and make you\nhappy. We want to see her again, but we shall come to her. We\nhope to pay a visit to the Alm every year, for we have good cause\nto offer up especial thanks to God upon this spot where so great\na miracle has been wrought upon our child.”",
        "And now grandmother’s face was lighted up with genuine\nhappiness, and she pressed Frau Sesemann’s hand over and over\nagain, unable to speak her thanks, while two large tears of joy\nrolled down her aged cheeks. And Heidi saw the glad change come\nover grandmother’s face, and she too now was entirely happy.",
        "She clung to the old woman, saying, “Hasn’t it all come about,\ngrandmother, just like the hymn I read to you last time? Isn’t\nthe bed from Frankfurt sent to make you well?”",
        "“Yes, Heidi, and many, many other good things too, which God has\nsent me,” said the grandmother, deeply moved. “I did not think\nit possible that there were so many kind people, ready to trouble\nthemselves about a poor old woman and to do so much for her.\nNothing strengthens our belief in a kind heavenly Father who\nnever forgets even the least of His creatures so much as to know\nthat there are such people, full of goodness and pity for a poor\nuseless creature such as I am.”",
        "“My good grandmother,” said Frau Sesemann, interrupting her, “we\nare all equally poor and helpless in the eyes of God, and all\nhave equal need that He should not forget us. But now we must\nsay good-bye, but only till we meet again, for when we pay our\nnext year’s visit to the Alm you will be the first person we\nshall come and see; meanwhile we shall not forget you.” And Frau\nSesemann took grandmother’s hand again and shook it in farewell.",
        "But grandmother would not let her off even then without more\nwords of gratitude, and without calling down on her benefactress\nand all belonging to her every blessing that God had to bestow.",
        "At last Herr Sesemann and his mother were able to continue their\njourney downwards, while Uncle carried Clara back home, with\nHeidi beside him, so full of joy of what was coming for\ngrandmother that every step was a jump.",
        "But there were many tears shed the following morning by the\ndeparting Clara, who wept to say good-bye to the beautiful\nmountain home where she had been happier than ever in her life\nbefore. Heidi did her best to comfort her. “Summer will be here\nagain in no time,” she said, “and then you will come again, and\nit will be nicer still, for you will be able to walk about from\nthe beginning. We can then go out every day with the goats up to\nwhere the flowers grow, and enjoy ourselves from the moment you\narrive.”",
        "Herr Sesemann had come as arranged to fetch his little daughter\naway, and was just now standing and talking with Uncle, for they\nhad much to say to one another. Clara felt somewhat consoled by\nHeidi’s words, and wiped away her tears.",
        "“Be sure you say good-bye for me to Peter and the goats, and\nespecially to Little Swan. I wish I could give Little Swan a\npresent, for she has helped so much to make me strong.”",
        "“Well, you can if you like,” replied Heidi, “send her a little\nsalt; you know how she likes to lick some out of grandfather’s\nhand when she comes home at night.”",
        "Clara was delighted at this idea. “Oh, then I shall send a\nhundred pounds of salt from Frankfurt, for I want her to have\nsomething as a remembrance of me.”",
        "Herr Sesemann now beckoned to the children as it was time to be\noff. Grandmamma’s white horse had been brought up for Clara, as\nshe was no longer obliged to be carried in a chair.",
        "Heidi ran to the far edge of the slope and continued to wave her\nhand to Clara until the last glimpse of horse and rider had\ndisappeared.",
        "And now the bed has arrived, and grandmother is sleeping so\nsoundly all night that she is sure to grow stronger.",
        "Grandmamma, moreover, has not forgotten how cold the winter is\non the mountain. She has sent a large parcel of warm clothing of\nevery description, so that grandmother can wrap herself round\nand round, and will certainly not tremble with cold now as she\nsits in her corner.",
        "There is a great deal of building going on at Dorfli. The doctor\nhas arrived, and, for the present, is occupying his old\nquarters. His friends have advised him to buy the old house that\nUncle and Heidi live in during the winter, which had evidently,\njudging from the height of the rooms and the magnificent stove\nwith its artistically-painted tiles, been a fine gentleman’s\nplace at one time. The doctor is having this part of the old\nhouse rebuilt for himself, the other part being repaired for\nUncle and Heidi, for the doctor is aware that Uncle is a man of\nindependent spirit, who likes to have a house to himself. Quite\nat the back a warm and well-walled stall is being put up for the\ntwo goats, and there they will pass their winter in comfort.",
        "The doctor and Uncle are becoming better friends every day, and\nas they walk about the new buildings to see how they are getting\non, their thoughts continually turn to Heidi, for the chief\npleasure to each in connection with the house is that they will\nhave the light-hearted little child with them there.",
        "“Dear friend,” said the doctor on one of these occasions as they\nwere standing together, “you will see this matter in the same\nlight as I do, I am sure. I share your happiness in the child as\nif, next to you, I was the one to whom she most closely\nbelonged, but I wish also to share all responsibilities,\nconcerning her and to do my best for the child. I shall then feel\nI have my rights in her, and shall look forward to her being with\nme and caring for me in my old age, which is the one great wish\nof my heart. She will have the same claims upon me as if she were\nmy own child, and I shall provide for her as such, and so we\nshall be able to leave her without anxiety when the day comes\nthat you and I must go.”",
        "Uncle did not speak, but he clasped the doctor’s hand in his,\nand his good friend could read in the old man’s eyes how greatly\nmoved he was and how glad and grateful he felt.",
        "Heidi and Peter were at this moment sitting with grandmother,\nand the one had so much to relate, and the others to listen to,\nthat they all three got closer and closer to one another, hardly\nable to breathe in their eagerness not to miss a word.",
        "And how much there was to tell of all the events that had taken\nplace that last summer, for they had not had many opportunities\nof meeting since then.",
        "And it was difficult to say which of the three looked the\nhappiest at being together again, and at the recollection of all\nthe wonderful things that had happened. Mother Brigitta’s face\nwas perhaps the happiest of all, as now, with the help of\nexplanation she was able to understand for the first time the\nhistory of Peter’s weekly penny for life.",
        "Then at last the grandmother spoke, “Heidi, read me one of the\nhymns! I can feel I can do nothing for the remainder of my life\nbut thank the Father in Heaven for all the mercies he has shown\nus!”",
