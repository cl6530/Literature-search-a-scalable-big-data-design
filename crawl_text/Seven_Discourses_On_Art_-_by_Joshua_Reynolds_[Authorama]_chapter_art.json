        "It is a happy memory that associates the foundation of our Royal\nAcademy with the delivery of these inaugural discourses by Sir\nJoshua Reynolds, on the opening of the schools, and at the first\nannual meetings for the distribution of its prizes.  They laid down\nprinciples of art from the point of view of a man of genius who had\nmade his power felt, and with the clear good sense which is the\nfoundation of all work that looks upward and may hope to live.  The\ntruths here expressed concerning Art may, with slight adjustment of\nthe way of thought, be applied to Literature or to any exercise of\nthe best powers of mind for shaping the delights that raise us to\nthe larger sense of life.  In his separation of the utterance of\nwhole truths from insistance upon accidents of detail, Reynolds was\nright, because he guarded the expression of his view with careful\ndefinitions of its limits.  In the same way Boileau was right, as a\ncritic of Literature, in demanding everywhere good sense, in\ncondemning the paste brilliants of a style then in decay, and\nfixing attention upon the masterly simplicity of Roman poets in the\ntime of Augustus.  Critics by rule of thumb reduced the principles\nclearly defined by Boileau to a dull convention, against which\nthere came in course of time a strong reaction.  In like manner the\nteaching of Reynolds was applied by dull men to much vague and\nconventional generalisation in the name of dignity.  Nevertheless,\nReynolds taught essential truths of Art.  The principles laid down\nby him will never fail to give strength to the right artist, or\ntrue guidance towards the appreciation of good art, though here and\nthere we may not wholly assent to some passing application of them,\nwhere the difference may be great between a fashion of thought in\nhis time and in ours.  A righteous enforcement of exact truth in\nour day has led many into a readiness to appreciate more really the\nminute imitation of a satin dress, or a red herring, than the\nnoblest figure in the best of Raffaelle’s cartoons.  Much good\nshould come of the diffusion of this wise little book.",
        "Joshua Reynolds was born on the 15th of July, 1723, the son of a\nclergyman and schoolmaster, at Plympton in Devonshire.  His bent\nfor Art was clear and strong from his childhood.  In 1741 at the\nage of nineteen, he began study, and studied for two yours in\nLondon under Thomas Hudson, a successful portrait painter.  Then he\nwent back to Devonshire and painted portraits, aided for some time\nin his education by attention to the work of William Gandy of\nExeter.  When twenty-six years old, in May, 1749, Reynolds was\ntaken away by Captain Keppel to the Mediterranean, and brought into\ncontact with the works of the great painters of Italy.  He stayed\ntwo years in Rome, and in accordance with the principles afterwards\nlaid down in these lectures, he refused, when in Rome, commissions\nfor copying, and gave his mind to minute observation of the art of\nthe great masters by whose works he was surrounded.  He spent two\nmonths in Florence, six weeks in Venice, a few days in Bologna and\nParma.  “If,” he said, “I had never seen any of the fine works of\nCorreggio, I should never, perhaps, have remarked in Nature the\nexpression which I find in one of his pieces; or if I had remarked\nit, I might have thought it too difficult, or perhaps impossible to\nexecute.”",
        "In 1753 Reynolds came back to England, and stayed three months in\nDevonshire before setting up a studio in London, in St. Martin’s\nLane, which was then an artists’ quarter.  His success was rapid.\nIn 1755 he had one hundred and twenty-five sitters.  Samuel Johnson\nfound in him his most congenial friend.  He moved to Newport\nStreet, and he built himself a studio–where there is now an\nauction room–at 47, Lincoln’s Inn Fields.  There he remained for\nlife.",
        "In 1760 the artists opened, in a room lent by the Society of Arts,\na free Exhibition for the sale of their works.  This was continued\nthe next year at Spring Gardens, with a charge of a shilling for\nadmission.  In 1765 they obtained a charter of incorporation, and\nin 1768 the King gave his support to the foundation of a Royal\nAcademy of Arts by seceders from the preceding “Incorporated\nSociety of Artists,” into which personal feelings had brought much\ndivision.  It was to consist, like the French Academy, of forty\nmembers, and was to maintain Schools open to all students of good\ncharacter who could give evidence that they had fully learnt the\nrudiments of Art.  The foundation by the King dates from the 10th\nof December, 1768.  The Schools were opened on the 2nd of January\nnext following, and on that occasion Joshua Reynolds, who had been\nelected President–his age was then between forty-five and forty-\nsix–gave the Inaugural Address which formed the first of these\nSeven Discourses.  The other six were given by him, as President,\nat the next six annual meetings:  and they were all shaped to form,\nwhen collected into a volume, a coherent body of good counsel upon\nthe foundations of the painter’s art.",
        "H. M.",
        "The regular progress of cultivated life is from necessaries to\naccommodations, from accommodations to ornaments.  By your\nillustrious predecessors were established marts for manufactures,\nand colleges for science; but for the arts of elegance, those arts\nby which manufactures are embellished and science is refined, to\nfound an academy was reserved for your Majesty.",
        "Had such patronage been without effect, there had been reason to\nbelieve that nature had, by some insurmountable impediment,\nobstructed our proficiency; but the annual improvement of the\nexhibitions which your Majesty has been pleased to encourage shows\nthat only encouragement had been wanting.",
        "To give advice to those who are contending for royal liberality has\nbeen for some years the duty of my station in the Academy; and\nthese Discourses hope for your Majesty’s acceptance as well-\nintended endeavours to incite that emulation which your notice has\nkindled, and direct those studies which your bounty has rewarded.",
        "May it please your Majesty,\nYour Majesty’s\nMost dutiful servant,\nAnd most faithful subject,\nJoshua Reynolds.",
        "Gentlemen,–That you have ordered the publication of this Discourse\nis not only very flattering to me, as it implies your approbation\nof the method of study which I have recommended; but likewise, as\nthis method receives from that act such an additional weight and\nauthority as demands from the students that deference and respect,\nwhich can be due only to the united sense of so considerable a body\nof artists.",
        "I am,\nWith the greatest esteem and respect,\nGentlemen,\nYour most humble\nAnd obedient servant,\nJoshua Reynolds",
        "Delivered at the Opening of the Royal Academy, January 2nd, 1769,\nby the President",
        "Gentlemen,–An academy in which the polite arts may be regularly\ncultivated is at last opened among us by royal munificence.  This\nmust appear an event in the highest degree interesting, not only to\nthe artists, but to the whole nation.",
        "It is indeed difficult to give any other reason why an Empire like\nthat of Britain should so long have wanted an ornament so suitable\nto its greatness than that slow progression of things which\nnaturally makes elegance and refinement the last effect of opulence\nand power.",
        "An institution like this has often been recommended upon\nconsiderations merely mercantile.  But an academy founded upon such\nprinciples can never effect even its own narrow purposes.  If it\nhas an origin no higher, no taste can ever be formed in it which\ncan be useful even in manufactures; but if the higher arts of\ndesign flourish, these inferior ends will be answered of course.",
        "We are happy in having a prince who has conceived the design of\nsuch an institution, according to its true dignity, and promotes\nthe arts, as the head of a great, a learned, a polite, and a\ncommercial nation; and I can now congratulate you, gentlemen, on\nthe accomplishment of your long and ardent wishes.",
        "The numberless and ineffectual consultations that I have had with\nmany in this assembly, to form plans and concert schemes for an\nacademy, afford a sufficient proof of the impossibility of\nsucceeding but by the influence of Majesty.  But there have,\nperhaps, been times when even the influence of Majesty would have\nbeen ineffectual, and it is pleasing to reflect that we are thus\nembodied, when every circumstance seems to concur from which honour\nand prosperity can probably arise.",
        "There are at this time a greater number of excellent artists than\nwere ever known before at one period in this nation; there is a\ngeneral desire among our nobility to be distinguished as lovers and\njudges of the arts; there is a greater superfluity of wealth among\nthe people to reward the professors; and, above all, we are\npatronised by a monarch, who, knowing the value of science and of\nelegance, thinks every art worthy of his notice that tends to\nsoften and humanise the mind.",
        "After so much has been done by his Majesty, it will be wholly our\nfault if our progress is not in some degree correspondent to the\nwisdom and, generosity of the institution; let us show our\ngratitude in our diligence, that, though our merit may not answer\nhis expectations, yet, at least, our industry may deserve his\nprotection.",
        "But whatever may be our proportion of success, of this we may be\nsure, that the present institution will at least contribute to\nadvance our knowledge of the arts, and bring us nearer to that\nideal excellence which it is the lot of genius always to\ncontemplate and never to attain.",
        "The principal advantage of an academy is, that, besides furnishing\nable men to direct the student, it will be a repository for the\ngreat examples of the art.  These are the materials on which genius\nis to work, and without which the strongest intellect may be\nfruitlessly or deviously employed.  By studying these authentic\nmodels, that idea of excellence which is the result of the\naccumulated experience of past ages may be at once acquired, and\nthe tardy and obstructed progress of our predecessors may teach us\na shorter and easier way.  The student receives at one glance the\nprinciples which many artists have spent their whole lives in\nascertaining; and, satisfied with their effect, is spared the\npainful investigation by which they come to be known and fixed.\nHow many men of great natural abilities have been lost to this\nnation for want of these advantages?  They never had an opportunity\nof seeing those masterly efforts of genius which at once kindle the\nwhole soul, and force it into sudden and irresistible approbation.",
        "Raffaelle, it is true, had not the advantage of studying in an\nacademy; but all Rome, and the works of Michael Angelo in\nparticular, were to him an academy.  On the site of the Capel la\nSistina he immediately from a dry, Gothic, and even insipid manner,\nwhich attends to the minute accidental discriminations of\nparticular and individual objects, assumed that grand style of\npainting, which improves partial representation by the general and\ninvariable ideas of nature.",
        "Every seminary of learning may be said to be surrounded with an\natmosphere of floating knowledge, where every mind may imbibe\nsomewhat congenial to its own original conceptions.  Knowledge,\nthus obtained, has always something more popular and useful than\nthat which is forced upon the mind by private precepts or solitary\nmeditation.  Besides, it is generally found that a youth more\neasily receives instruction from the companions of his studies,\nwhose minds are nearly on a level with his own, than from those who\nare much his superiors; and it is from his equals only that he\ncatches the fire of emulation.",
        "One advantage, I will venture to affirm, we shall have in our\nacademy, which no other nation can boast.  We shall have nothing to\nunlearn.  To this praise the present race of artists have a just\nclaim.  As far as they have yet proceeded they are right.  With us\nthe exertions of genius will henceforward be directed to their\nproper objects.  It will not be as it has been in other schools,\nwhere he that travelled fastest only wandered farthest from the\nright way.",
        "Impressed as I am, therefore, with such a favourable opinion of my\nassociates in this undertaking, it would ill become me to dictate\nto any of them.  But as these institutions have so often failed in\nother nations, and as it is natural to think with regret how much\nmight have been done, and how little has been done, I must take\nleave to offer a few hints, by which those errors may be rectified,\nand those defects supplied.  These the professors and visitors may\nreject or adopt as they shall think proper.",
        "I would chiefly recommend that an implicit obedience to the rules\nof art, as established by the great masters, should be exacted from\nthe YOUNG students.  That those models, which have passed through\nthe approbation of ages, should be considered by them as perfect\nand infallible guides as subjects for their imitation, not their\ncriticism.",
        "I am confident that this is the only efficacious method of making a\nprogress in the arts; and that he who sets out with doubting will\nfind life finished before he becomes master of the rudiments.  For\nit may be laid down as a maxim, that he who begins by presuming on\nhis own sense has ended his studies as soon as he has commenced\nthem.  Every opportunity, therefore, should be taken to\ndiscountenance that false and vulgar opinion that rules are the\nfetters of genius.  They are fetters only to men of no genius; as\nthat armour, which upon the strong becomes an ornament and a\ndefence, upon the weak and misshapen turns into a load, and\ncripples the body which it was made to protect.",
        "How much liberty may be taken to break through those rules, and, as\nthe poet expresses it,",
        "“To snatch a grace beyond the reach of art,”",
        "may be an after consideration, when the pupils become masters\nthemselves.  It is then, when their genius has received its utmost\nimprovement, that rules may possibly be dispensed with.  But let us\nnot destroy the scaffold until we have raised the building.",
        "The directors ought more particularly to watch over the genius of\nthose students who, being more advanced, are arrived at that\ncritical period of study, on the nice management of which their\nfuture turn of taste depends.  At that age it is natural for them\nto be more captivated with what is brilliant than with what is\nsolid, and to prefer splendid negligence to painful and humiliating\nexactness.",
        "A facility in composing, a lively, and what is called a masterly\nhandling the chalk or pencil, are, it must be confessed,\ncaptivating qualities to young minds, and become of course the\nobjects of their ambition.  They endeavour to imitate those\ndazzling excellences, which they will find no great labour in\nattaining.  After much time spent in these frivolous pursuits, the\ndifficulty will be to retreat; but it will be then too late; and\nthere is scarce an instance of return to scrupulous labour after\nthe mind has been debauched and deceived by this fallacious\nmastery.",
        "By this useless industry they are excluded from all power of\nadvancing in real excellence.  Whilst boys, they are arrived at\ntheir utmost perfection; they have taken the shadow for the\nsubstance; and make that mechanical facility the chief excellence\nof the art, which is only an ornament, and of the merit of which\nfew but painters themselves are judges.",
        "This seems to me to be one of the most dangerous sources of\ncorruption; and I speak of it from experience, not as an error\nwhich may possibly happen, but which has actually infected all\nforeign academies.  The directors were probably pleased with this\npremature dexterity in their pupils, and praised their despatch at\nthe expense of their correctness.",
        "But young men have not only this frivolous ambition of being\nthought masterly inciting them on one hand, but also their natural\nsloth tempting them on the other.  They are terrified at the\nprospect before them, of the toil required to attain exactness.\nThe impetuosity of youth is distrusted at the slow approaches of a\nregular siege, and desires, from mere impatience of labour, to take\nthe citadel by storm.  They wish to find some shorter path to\nexcellence, and hope to obtain the reward of eminence by other\nmeans than those which the indispensable rules of art have\nprescribed.  They must, therefore, be told again and again that\nlabour is the only price of solid fame, and that whatever their\nforce of genius may be, there is no easy method of becoming a good\npainter.",
        "When we read the lives of the most eminent painters, every page\ninforms us that no part of their time was spent in dissipation.\nEven an increase of fame served only to augment their industry.  To\nbe convinced with what persevering assiduity they pursued their\nstudies, we need only reflect on their method of proceeding in\ntheir most celebrated works.  When they conceived a subject, they\nfirst made a variety of sketches; then a finished drawing of the\nwhole; after that a more correct drawing of every separate part,\nheads, hands, feet, and pieces of drapery; they then painted the\npicture, and after all re-touched it from the life.  The pictures,\nthus wrought with such pain, now appear like the effect of\nenchantment, and as if some mighty genius had struck them off at a\nblow.",
        "But, whilst diligence is thus recommended to the students, the\nvisitors will take care that their diligence be effectual; that it\nbe well directed and employed on the proper object.  A student is\nnot always advancing because he is employed; he must apply his\nstrength to that part of the art where the real difficulties lie;\nto that part which distinguishes it as a liberal art, and not by\nmistaken industry lose his time in that which is merely ornamental.\nThe students, instead of vying with each other which shall have the\nreadiest band, should be taught to contend who shall have the\npurest and most correct outline, instead of striving which shall\nproduce the brightest tint, or, curiously trifling endeavour to\ngive the gloss of stuffs so as to appear real, let their ambition\nbe directed to contend which shall dispose his drapery in the most\ngraceful folds, which shall give the most grace and dignity to the\nhuman figure.",
        "I must beg leave to submit one thing more to the consideration of\nthe visitors, which appears to me a matter of very great\nconsequence, and the omission of which I think a principal defect\nin the method of education pursued in all the academies I have ever\nvisited.  The error I mean is, that the students never draw exactly\nfrom the living models which they have before them.  It is not\nindeed their intention, nor are they directed to do it.  Their\ndrawings resemble the model only in the attitude.  They change the\nform according to their vague and uncertain ideas of beauty, and\nmake a drawing rather of what they think the figure ought to be\nthan of what it appears.  I have thought this the obstacle that has\nstopped the progress of many young men of real genius; and I very\nmuch doubt whether a habit of drawing correctly what we see will\nnot give a proportionable power of drawing correctly what we\nimagine.  He who endeavours to copy nicely the figure before him\nnot only acquires a habit of exactness and precision, but is\ncontinually advancing in his knowledge of the human figure; and\nthough he seems to superficial observers to make a slower progress,\nhe will be found at last capable of adding (without running into\ncapricious wildness) that grace and beauty which is necessary to be\ngiven to his more finished works, and which cannot be got by the\nmoderns, as it was not acquired by the ancients, but by an\nattentive and well-compared study of the human form.",
        "What I think ought to enforce this method is, that it has been the\npractice (as may be seen by their drawings) of the great masters in\nthe art.  I will mention a drawing of Raffaelle, “The Dispute of\nthe Sacrament,” the print of which, by Count Cailus, is in every\nhand.  It appears that he made his sketch from one model; and the\nhabit he had of drawing exactly from the form before him appears by\nhis making all the figures with the same cap, such as his model\nthen happened to wear; so servile a copyist was this great man,\neven at a time when he was allowed to be at his highest pitch of\nexcellence.",
        "I have seen also academy figures by Annibale Caracci, though he was\noften sufficiently licentious in his finished works, drawn with all\nthe peculiarities of an individual model.",
        "This scrupulous exactness is so contrary to the practice of the\nacademies, that it is not without great deference that I beg leave\nto recommend it to the consideration of the visitors, and submit it\nto them, whether the neglect of this method is not one of the\nreasons why students so often disappoint expectation, and being\nmore than boys at sixteen, become less than men at thirty.",
        "In short, the method I recommend can only be detrimental when there\nare but few living forms to copy; for then students, by always\ndrawing from one alone, will by habit be taught to overlook\ndefects, and mistake deformity for beauty.  But of this there is no\ndanger, since the council has determined to supply the academy with\na variety of subjects; and indeed those laws which they have drawn\nup, and which the secretary will presently read for your\nconfirmation, have in some measure precluded me from saying more\nupon this occasion.  Instead, therefore, of offering my advice,\npermit me to indulge my wishes, and express my hope, that this\ninstitution may answer the expectations of its royal founder; that\nthe present age may vie in arts with that of Leo X. and that “the\ndignity of the dying art” (to make use of an expression of Pliny)\nmay be revived under the reign of George III.",
        "Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy, on the Distribution\nof the Prizes, December 11, I769, by the President.",
        "Gentlemen,–I congratulate you on the honour which you have just\nreceived.  I have the highest opinion of your merits, and could\nwish to show my sense of them in something which possibly may be\nmore useful to you than barren praise.  I could wish to lead you\ninto such a course of study as may render your future progress\nanswerable to your past improvement; and, whilst I applaud you for\nwhat has been done, remind you of how much yet remains to attain\nperfection.",
        "I flatter myself, that from the long experience I have had, and the\nunceasing assiduity with which I have pursued those studies, in\nwhich, like you, I have been engaged, I shall be acquitted of\nvanity in offering some hints to your consideration.  They are\nindeed in a great degree founded upon my own mistakes in the same\npursuit.  But the history of errors properly managed often shortens\nthe road to truth.  And although no method of study that I can\noffer will of itself conduct to excellence, yet it may preserve\nindustry from being misapplied.",
        "In speaking to you of the theory of the art, I shall only consider\nit as it has a relation to the method of your studies.",
        "Dividing the study of painting into three distinct periods, I shall\naddress you as having passed through the first of them, which is\nconfined to the rudiments, including a facility of drawing any\nobject that presents itself, a tolerable readiness in the\nmanagement of colours, and an acquaintance with the most simple and\nobvious rules of composition.",
        "This first degree of proficiency is, in painting, what grammar is\nin literature, a general preparation to whatever species of the art\nthe student may afterwards choose for his more particular\napplication.  The power of drawing, modelling, and using colours is\nvery properly called the language of the art; and in this language,\nthe honours you have just received prove you to have made no\ninconsiderable progress.",
        "When the artist is once enabled to express himself with some degree\nof correctness, he must then endeavour to collect subjects for\nexpression; to amass a stock of ideas, to be combined and varied as\noccasion may require.  He is now in the second period of study, in\nwhich his business is to learn all that has hitherto been known and\ndone.  Having hitherto received instructions from a particular\nmaster, he is now to consider the art itself as his master.  He\nmust extend his capacity to more sublime and general instructions.\nThose perfections which lie scattered among various masters are now\nunited in one general idea, which is henceforth to regulate his\ntaste and enlarge his imagination.  With a variety of models thus\nbefore him, he will avoid that narrowness and poverty of conception\nwhich attends a bigoted admiration of a single master, and will\ncease to follow any favourite where he ceases to excel.  This\nperiod is, however, still a time of subjection and discipline.\nThough the student will not resign himself blindly to any single\nauthority when he may have the advantage of consulting many, he\nmust still be afraid of trusting his own judgment, and of deviating\ninto any track where he cannot find the footsteps of some former\nmaster.",
        "The third and last period emancipates the student from subjection\nto any authority but what he shall himself judge to be supported by\nreason.  Confiding now in his own judgment, he will consider and\nseparate those different principles to which different modes of\nbeauty owe their original.  In the former period he sought only to\nknow and combine excellence, wherever it was to be found, into one\nidea of perfection; in this he learns, what requires the most\nattentive survey and the subtle disquisition, to discriminate\nperfections that are incompatible with each other.",
        "He is from this time to regard himself as holding the same rank\nwith those masters whom he before obeyed as teachers, and as\nexercising a sort of sovereignty over those rules which have\nhitherto restrained him.  Comparing now no longer the performances\nof art with each other, but examining the art itself by the\nstandard of nature, he corrects what is erroneous, supplies what is\nscanty, and adds by his own observation what the industry of his\npredecessors may have yet left wanting to perfection.  Having well\nestablished his judgment, and stored his memory, he may now without\nfear try the power of his imagination.  The mind that has been thus\ndisciplined may be indulged in the warmest enthusiasm, and venture\nto play on the borders of the wildest extravagance.  The habitual\ndignity, which long converse with the greatest minds has imparted\nto him, will display itself in all his attempts, and he will stand\namong his instructors, not as an imitator, but a rival.",
        "These are the different stages of the art.  But as I now address\nmyself particularly to those students who have been this day\nrewarded for their happy passage through the first period, I can\nwith no propriety suppose they want any help in the initiatory\nstudies.  My present design is to direct your view to distant\nexcellence, and to show you the readiest path that leads to it.  Of\nthis I shall speak with such latitude as may leave the province of\nthe professor uninvaded, and shall not anticipate those precepts\nwhich it is his business to give and your duty to understand.",
        "It is indisputably evident that a great part of every man’s life\nmust be employed in collecting materials for the exercise of\ngenius.  Invention, strictly speaking, is little more than a new\ncombination of those images which have been previously gathered and\ndeposited in the memory.  Nothing can come of nothing.  He who has\nlaid up no materials can produce no combinations.",
        "A student unacquainted with the attempts of former adventurers is\nalways apt to overrate his own abilities, to mistake the most\ntrifling excursions for discoveries of moment, and every coast new\nto him for a new-found country.  If by chance he passes beyond his\nusual limits, he congratulates his own arrival at those regions\nwhich they who have steered a better course have long left behind\nthem.",
        "The productions of such minds are seldom distinguished by an air of\noriginality:  they are anticipated in their happiest efforts; and\nif they are found to differ in anything from their predecessors, it\nis only in irregular sallies and trifling conceits.  The more\nextensive therefore your acquaintance is with the works of those\nwho have excelled the more extensive will be your powers of\ninvention; and what may appear still more like a paradox, the more\noriginal will be your conceptions.  But the difficulty on this\noccasion is to determine who ought to be proposed as models of\nexcellence, and who ought to be considered as the properest guides.",
        "To a young man just arrived in Italy, many of the present painters\nof that country are ready enough to obtrude their precepts, and to\noffer their own performances as examples of that perfection which\nthey affect to recommend.  The modern, however, who recommends\nHIMSELF as a standard, may justly be suspected as ignorant of the\ntrue end, and unacquainted with the proper object of the art which\nhe professes.  To follow such a guide will not only retard the\nstudent, but mislead him.",
        "On whom, then, can he rely, or who shall show him the path that\nleads to excellence?  The answer is obvious:  Those great masters\nwho have travelled the same road with success are the most likely\nto conduct others.  The works of those who have stood the test of\nages have a claim to that respect and veneration to which no modern\ncan pretend.  The duration and stability of their fame is\nsufficient to evince that it has not been suspended upon the\nslender thread of fashion and caprice, but bound to the human heart\nby every tie of sympathetic approbation.",
        "There is no danger of studying too much the works of those great\nmen, but how they may be studied to advantage is an inquiry of\ngreat importance.",
        "Some who have never raised their minds to the consideration of the\nreal dignity of the art, and who rate the works of an artist in\nproportion as they excel, or are defective in the mechanical parts,\nlook on theory as something that may enable them to talk but not to\npaint better, and confining themselves entirely to mechanical\npractice, very assiduously toil on in the drudgery of copying, and\nthink they make a rapid progress while they faithfully exhibit the\nminutest part of a favourite picture.  This appears to me a very\ntedious, and I think a very erroneous, method of proceeding.  Of\nevery large composition, even of those which are most admired, a\ngreat part may be truly said to be common-place.  This, though it\ntakes up much time in copying, conduces little to improvement.  I\nconsider general copying as a delusive kind of industry; the\nstudent satisfies himself with the appearance of doing something;\nhe falls into the dangerous habit of imitating without selecting,\nand of labouring without any determinate object; as it requires no\neffort of the mind, he sleeps over his work; and those powers of\ninvention and composition which ought particularly to be called out\nand put in action lie torpid, and lose their energy for want of\nexercise.",
        "It is an observation that all must have made, how incapable those\nare of producing anything of their own who have spent much of their\ntime in making finished copies.",
        "To suppose that the complication of powers, and variety of ideas\nnecessary to that mind which aspires to the first honours ill the\nart of painting, can be obtained by the frigid contemplation of a\nfew single models, is no less absurd than it would be in him who\nwishes to be a poet to imagine that by translating a tragedy he can\nacquire to himself sufficient knowledge of the appearances of\nnature, the operations of the passions, and the incidents of life.",
        "The great use in copying, if it be at all useful, should seem to be\nin learning to colour; yet even colouring will never be perfectly\nattained by servilely copying the mould before you.  An eye\ncritically nice can only be formed by observing well-coloured\npictures with attention:  and by close inspection, and minute\nexamination you will discover, at last, the manner of handling, the\nartifices of contrast, glazing, and other expedients, by which good\ncolourists have raised the value of their tints, and by which\nnature has been so happily imitated.",
        "I must inform you, however, that old pictures deservedly celebrated\nfor their colouring are often so changed by dirt and varnish, that\nwe ought not to wonder if they do not appear equal to their\nreputation in the eyes of unexperienced painters, or young\nstudents.  An artist whose judgment is matured by long observation,\nconsiders rather what the picture once was, than what it is at\npresent.  He has acquired a power by habit of seeing the brilliancy\nof tints through the cloud by which it is obscured.  An exact\nimitation, therefore, of those pictures, is likely to fill the\nstudent’s mind with false opinions, and to send him back a\ncolourist of his own formation, with ideas equally remote from\nnature and from art, from the genuine practice of the masters and\nthe real appearances of things.",
        "Following these rules, and using these precautions, when you have\nclearly and distinctly learned in what good colouring consists, you\ncannot do better than have recourse to nature herself, who is\nalways at hand, and in comparison of whose true splendour the best\ncoloured pictures are but faint and feeble.",
        "However, as the practice of copying is not entirely to be excluded,\nsince the mechanical practice of painting is learned in some\nmeasure by it, let those choice parts only be selected which have\nrecommended the work to notice.  If its excellence consists in its\ngeneral effect, it would be proper to make slight sketches of the\nmachinery and general management of the picture.  Those sketches\nshould be kept always by you for the regulation of your style.\nInstead of copying the touches of those great masters, copy only\ntheir conceptions.  Instead of treading in their footsteps,\nendeavour only to keep the same road.  Labour to invent on their\ngeneral principles and way of thinking.  Possess yourself with\ntheir spirit.  Consider with yourself how a Michael Angelo or a\nRaffaelle would have treated this subject:  and work yourself into\na belief that your picture is to be seen and criticised by them\nwhen completed.  Even an attempt of this kind will rouse your\npowers.",
        "But as mere enthusiasm will carry you but a little way, let me\nrecommend a practice that may be equivalent, and will perhaps more\nefficaciously contribute to your advancement, than even the verbal\ncorrections of those masters themselves, could they be obtained.\nWhat I would propose is, that you should enter into a kind of\ncompetition, by painting a similar subject, and making a companion\nto any picture that you consider as a model.  After you have\nfinished your work, place it near the model, and compare them\ncarefully together.  You will then not only see, but feel your own\ndeficiencies more sensibly than by precepts, or any other means of\ninstruction.  The true principles of painting will mingle with your\nthoughts.  Ideas thus fixed by sensible objects, will be certain\nand definitive; and sinking deep into the mind, will not only be\nmore just, but more lasting than those presented to you by precepts\nonly:  which will, always be fleeting, variable, and undetermined.",
        "This method of comparing your own efforts with those of some great\nmaster, is indeed a severe and mortifying task, to which none will\nsubmit, but such as have great views, with fortitude sufficient to\nforego the gratifications of present vanity for future honour.\nWhen the student has succeeded in some measure to his own\nsatisfaction, and has felicitated himself on his success, to go\nvoluntarily to a tribunal where he knows his vanity must be\nhumbled, and all self-approbation must vanish, requires not only\ngreat resolution, but great humility.  To him, however, who has the\nAmbition to be a real master, the solid satisfaction which proceeds\nfrom a consciousness of his advancement (of which seeing his own\nfaults is the first step) will very abundantly compensate for the\nmortification of present disappointment.  There is, besides, this\nalleviating circumstance.  Every discovery he makes, every\nacquisition of knowledge he attains, seems to proceed from his own\nsagacity; and thus he acquires a confidence in himself sufficient\nto keep up the resolution of perseverance.",
        "We all must have experienced how lazily, and consequently how\nineffectually, instruction is received when forced upon the mind by\nothers.  Few have been taught to any purpose who have not been\ntheir own teachers.  We prefer those instructions which we have\ngiven ourselves, from our affection to the instructor; and they are\nmore effectual, from being received into the mind at the very time\nwhen it is most open and eager to receive them.",
        "With respect to the pictures that you are to choose for your\nmodels, I could wish that you would take the world’s opinion rather\nthan your own.  In other words, I would have you choose those of\nestablished reputation rather than follow your own fancy.  If you\nshould not admire them at first, you will, by endeavouring to\nimitate them, find that the world has not been mistaken.",
        "It is not an easy task to point out those various excellences for\nyour imitation which he distributed amongst the various schools.\nAn endeavour to do this may perhaps be the subject of some future\ndiscourse.  I will, therefore, at present only recommend a model\nfor style in painting, which is a branch of the art more\nimmediately necessary to the young student.  Style in painting is\nthe same as in writing, a power over materials, whether words or\ncolours, by which conceptions or sentiments are conveyed.  And in\nthis Lodovico Carrache (I mean in his best works) appears to me to\napproach the nearest to perfection.  His unaffected breadth of\nlight and shadow, the simplicity of colouring, which holding its\nproper rank, does not draw aside the least part of the attention\nfrom the subject, and the solemn effect of that twilight which\nseems diffused over his pictures, appear to me to correspond with\ngrave and dignified subjects, better than the more artificial\nbrilliancy of sunshine which enlightens the pictures of Titian.\nThough Tintoret thought that Titian’s colouring was the model of\nperfection, and would correspond even with the sublime of Michael\nAngelo; and that if Angelo had coloured like Titian, or Titian\ndesigned like Angelo, the world would once have had a perfect\npainter.",
        "It is our misfortune, however, that those works of Carrache which I\nwould recommend to the student are not often found out of Bologna.\nThe “St. Francis in the midst of his Friars,” “The\nTransfiguration,” “The Birth of St. John the Baptist,” “The Calling\nof St. Matthew,” the “St. Jerome,” the fresco paintings in the\nZampieri Palace, are all worthy the attention of the student.  And\nI think those who travel would do well to allot a much greater\nportion of their time to that city than it has been hitherto the\ncustom to bestow.",
        "In this art, as in others, there are many teachers who profess to\nshow the nearest way to excellence, and many expedients have been\ninvented by which the toil of study might be saved.  But let no man\nbe seduced to idleness by specious promises.  Excellence is never\ngranted to man but as the reward of labour.  It argues, indeed, no\nsmall strength of mind to persevere in habits of industry, without\nthe pleasure of perceiving those advances; which, like the hand of\na clock, whilst they make hourly approaches to their point, yet\nproceed so slowly as to escape observation.  A facility of drawing,\nlike that of playing upon a musical instrument, cannot be acquired\nbut by an infinite number of acts.  I need not, therefore, enforce\nby many words the necessity of continual application; nor tell you\nthat the port-crayon ought to be for ever in your hands.  Various\nmethods will occur to you by which this power may be acquired.  I\nwould particularly recommend that after your return from the\nacademy (where I suppose your attendance to be constant) you would\nendeavour to draw the figure by memory.  I will even venture to\nadd, that by perseverance in this custom, you will become able to\ndraw the human figure tolerably correct, with as little effort of\nthe mind as to trace with a pen the letters of the alphabet.",
        "That this facility is not unattainable, some members in this\nacademy give a sufficient proof.  And, be assured, that if this\npower is not acquired whilst you are young, there will be no time\nfor it afterwards:  at least, the attempt will be attended with as\nmuch difficulty as those experience who learn to read or write\nafter they have arrived to the age of maturity.",
        "But while I mention the port-crayon as the student’s constant\ncompanion, he must still remember that the pencil is the instrument\nby which he must hope to obtain eminence.  What, therefore, I wish\nto impress upon you is, that whenever an opportunity offers, you\npaint your studies instead of drawing them.  This will give you\nsuch a facility in using colours, that in time they will arrange\nthemselves under the pencil, even without the attention of the hand\nthat conducts it.  If one act excluded the other, this advice could\nnot with any propriety be given.  But if painting comprises both\ndrawing and colouring and if by a short struggle of resolute\nindustry the same expedition is attainable in painting as in\ndrawing on paper, I cannot see what objection can justly be made to\nthe practice; or why that should be done by parts, which may be\ndone altogether.",
        "If we turn our eyes to the several schools of painting, and\nconsider their respective excellences, we shall find that those who\nexcel most in colouring pursued this method.  The Venetian and\nFlemish schools, which owe much of their fame to colouring, have\nenriched the cabinets of the collectors of drawings with very few\nexamples.  Those of Titian, Paul Veronese, Tintoret, and the\nBassans, are in general slight and undetermined.  Their sketches on\npaper are as rude as their pictures are excellent in regard to\nharmony of colouring.  Correggio and Barocci have left few, if any,\nfinished drawings behind them.  And in the Flemish school, Rubens\nand Vandyke made their designs for the most part either in colours\nor in chiaroscuro.  It is as common to find studies of the Venetian\nand Flemish painters on canvas, as of the schools of Rome and\nFlorence on paper.  Not but that many finished drawings are sold\nunder the names of those masters.  Those, however, are undoubtedly\nthe productions either of engravers or of their scholars who copied\ntheir works.",
        "These instructions I have ventured to offer from my own experience;\nbut as they deviate widely from received opinions, I offer them\nwith diffidence; and when better are suggested, shall retract them\nwithout regret.",
        "There is one precept, however, in which I shall only be opposed by\nthe vain, the ignorant, and the idle.  I am not afraid that I shall\nrepeat it too often.  You must have no dependence on your own\ngenius.  If you have great talents, industry will improve them:  if\nyou have but moderate abilities, industry will supply their\ndeficiency.  Nothing is denied to well-directed labour:  nothing is\nto be obtained without it.  Not to enter into metaphysical\ndiscussions on the nature or essence of genius, I will venture to\nassert, that assiduity unabated by difficulty, and a disposition\neagerly directed to the object of its pursuit, will produce effects\nsimilar to those which some call the result of natural powers.",
        "Though a man cannot at all times, and in all places, paint or draw,\nyet the mind can prepare itself by laying in proper materials, at\nall times, and in all places.  Both Livy and Plutarch, in\ndescribing Philopoemen, one of the ablest generals of antiquity,\nhave given us a striking picture of a mind always intent on its\nprofession, and by assiduity obtaining those excellences which some\nall their lives vainly expect from Nature.  I shall quote the\npassage in Livy at length, as it runs parallel with the practice I\nwould recommend to the painter, sculptor, or architect.",
        "“Philopoemen was a man eminent for his sagacity and experience in\nchoosing ground, and in leading armies; to which he formed his mind\nby perpetual meditation, in times of peace as well as war.  When,\nin any occasional journey, he came to a straight difficult passage,\nif he was alone, he considered with himself, and if he was in\ncompany he asked his friends what it would be best to do if in this\nplace they had found an enemy, either in the front, or in the rear,\non the one side, or on the other.  ’It might happen,’ says he,\n’that the enemy to be opposed might come on drawn up in regular\nlines, or in a tumultuous body, formed only by the nature of the\nplace.’  He then considered a little what ground he should take;\nwhat number of soldiers he should use, and what arms he should give\nthem; where he should lodge his carriages, his baggage, and the\ndefenceless followers of his camp; how many guards, and of what\nkind, he should send to defend them; and whether it would be better\nto press forward along the pass, or recover by retreat his former\nstation:  he would consider likewise where his camp could most\ncommodiously be formed; how much ground he should enclose within\nhis trenches; where he should have the convenience of water; and\nwhere he might find plenty of wood and forage; and when he should\nbreak up his camp on the following day, through what road he could\nmost safely pass, and in what form he should dispose his troops.\nWith such thoughts and disquisitions he had from his early years so\nexercised his mind, that on these occasions nothing could happen\nwhich he had not been already accustomed to consider.”",
        "I cannot help imagining that I see a promising young painter,\nequally vigilant, whether at home, or abroad in the streets, or in\nthe fields.  Every object that presents itself is to him a lesson.\nHe regards all nature with a view to his profession; and combines\nher beauties, or corrects her defects.  He examines the countenance\nof men under the influence of passion; and often catches the most\npleasing hints from subjects of turbulence or deformity.  Even bad\npictures themselves supply him with useful documents; and, as\nLeonardo da Vinci has observed, he improves upon the fanciful\nimages that are sometimes seen in the fire, or are accidentally\nsketched upon a discoloured wall.",
        "The artist who has his mind thus filled with ideas, and his hand\nmade expert by practice, works with ease and readiness; whilst he\nwho would have you believe that he is waiting for the inspirations\nof genius, is in reality at a loss how to beam, and is at last\ndelivered of his monsters with difficulty and pain.",
        "The well-grounded painter, on the contrary, has only maturely to\nconsider his subject, and all the mechanical parts of his art\nfollow without his exertion, Conscious of the difficulty of\nobtaining what he possesses he makes no pretensions to secrets,\nexcept those of closer application.  Without conceiving the\nsmallest jealousy against others, he is contented that all shall be\nas great as himself who are willing to undergo the same fatigue:\nand as his pre-eminence depends not upon a trick, he is free from\nthe painful suspicions of a juggler, who lives in perpetual fear\nlest his trick should be discovered.",
        "Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy on the Distribution\nof the Prizes, December, 14, 1770, by the President",
        "Gentlemen,–It is not easy to speak with propriety to so many\nstudents of different ages and different degrees of advancement.\nThe mind requires nourishment adapted to its growth; and what may\nhave promoted our earlier efforts, might, retard us in our nearer\napproaches to perfection.",
        "The first endeavours of a young painter, as I have remarked in a\nformer discourse, must be employed in the attainment of mechanical\ndexterity, and confined to the mere imitation of the object before\nhim.  Those who have advanced beyond the rudiments, may, perhaps,\nfind advantage in reflecting on the advice which I have likewise\ngiven them, when I recommended the diligent study of the works of\nour great predecessors; but I at the same time endeavoured to guard\nthem against an implicit submission to the authority of any one\nmaster, however excellent; or by a strict imitation of his manner,\nto preclude ourselves from the abundance and variety of nature.  I\nwill now add that nature herself is not to be too closely copied.\nThere are excellences in the art of painting, beyond what is\ncommonly called the imitation of nature:  and these excellences I\nwish to point out.  The students who, having passed through the\ninitiatory exercises, are more advanced in the art, and who, sure\nof their hand, have leisure to exert their understanding, must now\nbe told that a mere copier of nature can never produce anything\ngreat; can never raise and enlarge the conceptions, or warm the\nheart of the spectator.",
        "The wish of the genuine painter must be more extensive:  instead of\nendeavouring to amuse mankind with the minute neatness of his\nimitations, he must endeavour to improve them by the grandeur of\nhis ideas; instead of seeking praise, by deceiving the superficial\nsense of the spectator, he must strive for fame, by captivating the\nimagination.",
        "The principle now laid down, that the perfection of this art does\nnot consist in mere imitation, is far from being new or singular.\nIt is, indeed, supported by the general opinion of the enlightened\npart of mankind.  The poets, orators, and rhetoricians of\nantiquity, are continually enforcing this position, that all the\narts receive their perfection from an ideal beauty, superior to\nwhat is to be found in individual nature.  They are ever referring\nto the practice of the painters and sculptors of their times,\nparticularly Phidias (the favourite artist of antiquity), to\nillustrate their assertions.  As if they could not sufficiently\nexpress their admiration of his genius by what they knew, they have\nrecourse to poetical enthusiasm.  They call it inspiration; a gift\nfrom heaven.  The artist is supposed to have ascended the celestial\nregions, to furnish his mind with this perfect idea of beauty.\n\"He,” says Proclus, “who takes for his model such forms as nature\nproduces, and confines himself to an exact imitation of them, will\nnever attain to what is perfectly beautiful.  For the works of\nnature are full of disproportion, and fall very short of the true\nstandard of beauty.  So that Phidias, when he formed his Jupiter,\ndid not copy any object ever presents to his sight; but\ncontemplated only that image which he had conceived in his mind\nfrom Homer’s description.”  And thus Cicero, speaking of the same\nPhidias:  “Neither did this artist,” says he, “when he carved the\nimage of Jupiter or Minerva, set before him any one human figure as\na pattern, which he was to copy; but having a more perfect idea of\nbeauty fixed in his mind, this he steadily contemplated, and to the\nimitation of this all his skill and labour were directed.",
        "The moderns are not less convinced than the ancients of this\nsuperior power existing in the art; nor less conscious of its\neffects.  Every language has adopted terms expressive of this\nexcellence.  The Gusto grande of the Italians; the Beau ideal of\nthe French and the GREAT STYLE, GENIUS, and TASTE among the\nEnglish, are but different appellations of the same thing.  It is\nthis intellectual dignity, they say, that ennobles the painter’s\nart; that lays the line between him and the mere mechanic; and\nproduces those great effects in an instant, which eloquence and\npoetry, by slow and repeated efforts, are scarcely able to attain.",
        "Such is the warmth with which both the ancients and moderns speak\nof this divine principle of the art; but, as I have formerly\nobserved, enthusiastic admiration seldom promotes knowledge.\nThough a student by such praise may have his attention roused, and\na desire excited, of running in this great career, yet it is\npossible that what has been said to excite, may only serve to deter\nhim.  He examines his own mind, and perceives there nothing of that\ndivine inspiration with which he is told so many others have been\nfavoured.  He never travelled to heaven to gather new ideas; and he\nfinds himself possessed of no other qualifications than what mere\ncommon observation and a plain understanding can confer.  Thus he\nbecomes gloomy amidst the splendour of figurative declamation, and\nthinks it hopeless to pursue an object which he supposes out of the\nreach of human industry.",
        "But on this, as upon many other occasions, we ought to distinguish\nhow much is to be given to enthusiasm, and how much to reason.  We\nought to allow for, and we ought to commend, that strength of vivid\nexpression which is necessary to convey, in its full force, the\nhighest sense of the most complete effect of art; taking care at\nthe same time not to lose in terms of vague admiration that\nsolidity and truth of principle upon which alone we can reason, and\nmay be enabled to practise.",
        "It is not easy to define in what this great style consists; nor to\ndescribe, by words, the proper means of acquiring it, if the mind\nof the student should be at all capable of such an acquisition.\nCould we teach taste or genius by rules, they would be no longer\ntaste and genius.  But though there neither are, nor can be, any\nprecise invariable rules for the exercise or the acquisition of\nthose great qualities, yet we may as truly say that they always\noperate in proportion to our attention in observing the works of\nnature, to our skill in selecting, and to our care in digesting,\nmethodising, and comparing our observations.  There are many\nbeauties in our art, that seem, at first, to lie without the reach\nof precept, and yet may easily be reduced to practical principles.\nExperience is all in all; but it is not every one who profits by\nexperience; and most people err, not so much from want of capacity\nto find their object, as from not knowing what object to pursue.\nThis great ideal perfection and beauty are not to be sought in the\nheavens, but upon the earth.  They are about us, and upon every\nside of us.  But the power of discovering what is deformed in\nnature, or in other words, what is particular and uncommon, can be\nacquired only by experience; and the whole beauty and grandeur of\nthe art consists, in my opinion, in being able to get above all\nsingular forms, local customs, particularities, and details of\nevery kind.",
        "All the objects which are exhibited to our view by nature, upon\nclose examination will be found to have their blemishes and\ndefects.  The most beautiful forms have something about them like\nweakness, minuteness, or imperfection.  But it is not every eye\nthat perceives these blemishes.  It must be an eye long used to the\ncontemplation and comparison of these forms; and which, by a long\nhabit of observing what any set of objects of the same kind have in\ncommon, that alone can acquire the power of discerning what each\nwants in particular.  This long laborious comparison should be the\nfirst study of the painter who aims at the greatest style.  By this\nmeans, he acquires a just idea of beautiful forms; he corrects\nnature by herself, her imperfect state by her more perfect.  His\neye being enabled to distinguish the accidental deficiencies,\nexcrescences, and deformities of things from their general figures,\nhe makes out an abstract idea of their forms more perfect than any\none original; and what may seem a paradox, he learns to design\nnaturally by drawing his figures unlike to any one object.  This\nidea of the perfect state of nature, which the artist calls the\nideal beauty, is the great leading principle by which works of\ngenius are conducted.  By this Phidias acquired his fame.  He\nwrought upon a sober principle what has so much excited the\nenthusiasm of the world; and by this method you, who have courage\nto tread the same path, may acquire equal reputation.",
        "This is the idea which has acquired, and which seems to have a\nright to the epithet of Divine; as it may be said to preside, like\na supreme judge, over all the productions of nature; appearing to\nbe possessed of the will and intention of the Creator, as far as\nthey regard the external form of living beings.",
        "When a man once possesses this idea in its perfection, there is no\ndanger but that he will he sufficiently warmed by it himself, and\nbe able to warm and ravish every one else.",
        "Thus it is from a reiterated experience, and a close comparison of\nthe objects in nature, that an artist becomes possessed of the idea\nof that central form, if I may so express it, from which every\ndeviation is deformity.  But the investigation of this form I grant\nis painful, and I know but of one method of shortening the road;\nthis is, by a careful study of the works of the ancient sculptors;\nwho, being indefatigable in the school of nature, have left models\nof that perfect form behind them, which an artist would prefer as\nsupremely beautiful, who had spent his whole life in that single\ncontemplation.  But if industry carried them thus far, may not you\nalso hope for the same reward from the same labour?  We have the\nsame school opened to us that was opened to them; for nature denies\nher instructions to none who desire to become her pupils.",
        "To the principle I have laid down, that the idea of beauty in each\nspecies of beings is invariably one, it may be objected that in\nevery particular species there are various central forms, which are\nseparate and distinct from each other, and yet are undeniably\nbeautiful; that in the human figure, for instance, the beauty of\nthe Hercules is one, of the gladiator another, of the Apollo\nanother, which makes so many different ideas of beauty.",
        "It is true, indeed, that these figures are each perfect in their\nkind, though of different characters and proportions; but still\nnone of them is the representation of an individual, but of a\nclass.  And as there is one general form, which, as I have said,\nbelongs to the human kind at large, so in each of these classes\nthere is one common idea and central form, which is the abstract of\nthe various individual forms belonging to that class.  Thus, though\nthe forms of childhood and age differ exceedingly, there is a\ncommon form in childhood, and a common form in age,–which is the\nmore perfect, as it is more remote from all peculiarities.  But I\nmust add further, that though the most perfect forms of each of the\ngeneral divisions of the human figure are ideal, and superior to\nany individual form of that class, yet the highest perfection of\nthe human figure is not to be found in any one of them.  It is not\nin the Hercules, nor in the gladiator, nor in the Apollo; but in\nthat form which is taken from them all, and which partakes equally\nof the activity of the gladiator, of the delicacy of the Apollo,\nand of the muscular strength of the Hercules.  For perfect beauty\nin any species must combine all the characters which are beautiful\nin that species.  It cannot consist in any one to the exclusion of\nthe rest:  no one, therefore, must be predominant, that no one may\nbe deficient.",
        "The knowledge of these different characters, and the power of\nseparating and distinguishing them, is undoubtedly necessary to the\npainter, who is to vary his compositions with figures of various\nforms and proportions, though he is never to lose sight of the\ngeneral idea of perfection in each kind.",
        "There is, likewise, a kind of symmetry or proportion, which may\nproperly be said to belong to deformity.  A figure lean or\ncorpulent, tall or short, though deviating from beauty, may still\nhave a certain union of the various parts, which may contribute to\nmake them, on the whole, not unpleasing.  When the artist has by\ndiligent attention acquired a clear and distinct idea of beauty and\nsymmetry; when he has reduced the variety of nature to the abstract\nidea; his next task will be to become acquainted with the genuine\nhabits of nature, as distinguished from those of fashion.  For in\nthe same manner, and on the same principles, as he has acquired the\nknowledge of the real forms of nature, distinct from accidental\ndeformity, he must endeavour to separate simple chaste nature from\nthose adventitious, those affected and forced airs or actions, with\nwhich she is loaded by modern education.",
        "Perhaps I cannot better explain what I mean than by reminding you\nof what was taught us by the Professor of Anatomy, in respect to\nthe natural position and movement of the feet.  He observed that\nthe fashion of turning, them outwards was contrary to the intent of\nnature, as might be seen from the structure of the bones, and from\nthe weakness that proceeded from that manner of standing.  To this\nwe may add the erect position of the head, the projection of the\nchest, the walking with straight knees, and many such actions,\nwhich are merely the result of fashion, and what nature never\nwarranted, as we are sure that we have been taught them when\nchildren.",
        "I have mentioned but a few of those instances, in which vanity or\ncaprice have contrived to distort and disfigure the human form;\nyour own recollection will add to these a thousand more of ill-\nunderstood methods, that have been practised to disguise nature,\namong our dancing-masters, hair-dressers, and tailors, in their\nvarious schools of deformity.",
        "However the mechanic and ornamental arts may sacrifice to fashion,\nshe must be entirely excluded from the art of painting; the painter\nmust never mistake this capricious changeling for the genuine\noffspring of nature; he must divest himself of all prejudices in\nfavour of his age or country; he must disregard all local and\ntemporary ornaments, and look only on those general habits that are\neverywhere and always the same.  He addresses his works to the\npeople of every country and every age; he calls upon posterity to\nbe his spectators, and says with Zeuxis, In aeternitatem pingo.",
        "The neglect of separating modern fashions from the habits of\nnature, leads to that ridiculous style which has been practised by\nsome painters who have given to Grecian heroes the airs and graces\npractised in the court of Louis XIV.; an absurdity almost as great\nas it would have been to have dressed them after the fashion of\nthat court.",
        "To avoid this error, however, and to retain the true simplicity of\nnature, is a task more difficult than at first sight it may appear.\nThe prejudices in favour of the fashions and customs that we have\nbeen used to, and which are justly called a second nature, make it\ntoo often difficult to distinguish that which is natural from that\nwhich is the result of education; they frequently even give a\npredilection in favour of the artificial mode; and almost every one\nis apt to be guided by those local prejudices who has not chastised\nhis mind, and regulated the instability of his affections, by the\neternal invariable idea of nature.",
        "Here, then, as before, we must have recourse to the ancients as\ninstructors.  It is from a careful study of their works that you\nwill be enabled to attain to the real simplicity of nature; they\nwill suggest many observations, which would probably escape you, if\nyour study were confined to nature alone.  And, indeed, I cannot\nhelp suspecting, that in this instance the ancients had an easier\ntask than the moderns.  They had, probably, little or nothing to\nunlearn, as their manners were nearly approaching to this desirable\nsimplicity; while the modern artist, before he can see the truth of\nthings, is obliged to remove a veil, with which the fashion of the\ntimes has thought proper to cover her.",
        "Having gone thus far in our investigation of the great style in\npainting; if we now should suppose that the artist has formed the\ntrue idea of beauty, which enables him to give his works a correct\nand perfect design; if we should suppose also that he has acquired\na knowledge of the unadulterated habits of nature, which gives him\nsimplicity; the rest of his talk is, perhaps, less than is\ngenerally imagined.  Beauty and simplicity have so great a share in\nthe composition of a great style, that he who has acquired them has\nlittle else to learn.  It must not, indeed, be forgot that there is\na nobleness of conception, which goes beyond anything in the mere\nexhibition, even of perfect form; there is an art of animating and\ndignifying the figures with intellectual grandeur, of impressing\nthe appearance of philosophic wisdom or heroic virtue.  This can\nonly be acquired by him that enlarges the sphere of his\nunderstanding by a variety of knowledge, and warms his imagination\nwith the best productions of ancient and modern poetry.",
        "A hand thus exercised, and a mind thus instructed, will bring the\nart to a higher degree of excellence than, perhaps, it has hitherto\nattained in this country.  Such a student will disdain the humbler\nwalks of painting, which, however profitable, can never assure him\na permanent reputation.  He will leave the meaner artist servilely\nto suppose that those are the best pictures which are most likely\nto deceive the spectator.  He will permit the lower painter, like\nthe florist or collector of shells, to exhibit the minute\ndiscriminations which distinguish one object of the same species\nfrom another; while he, like the philosopher, will consider nature\nin the abstract, and represent in every one of his figures the\ncharacter of its species.",
        "If deceiving the eye were the only business of the art, there is no\ndoubt, indeed, but the minute painter would be more apt to succeed:\nbut it is not the eye, it is the mind, which the painter of genius\ndesires to address; nor will he waste a moment upon these smaller\nobjects, which only serve to catch the sense, to divide the\nattention, and to counteract his great design of speaking to the\nheart.",
        "This is the ambition I could wish to excite in your minds; and the\nobject I have had in my view, throughout this discourse, is that\none great idea which gives to painting its true dignity, that\nentitles it to the name of a Liberal Art, and ranks it as a sister\nof poetry.",
        "It may possibly have happened to many young students whose\napplication was sufficient to overcome all difficulties, and whose\nminds were capable of embracing the most extensive views, that they\nhave, by a wrong direction originally given, spent their lives in\nthe meaner walks of painting, without ever knowing there was a\nnobler to pursue.  “Albert Durer,” as Vasari has justly remarked,\n\"would probably have been one of the first painters of his age (and\nhe lived in an era of great artists) had he been initiated into\nthose great principles of the art which were so well understood and\npractised by his contemporaries in Italy.  But unluckily, having\nnever seen or heard of any other manner, he considered his own,\nwithout doubt, as perfect.”",
        "As for the various departments of painting, which do not presume to\nmake such high pretensions, they are many.  None of them are\nwithout their merit, though none enter into competition with this\ngreat universal presiding idea of the art.  The painters who have\napplied themselves more particularly to low and vulgar characters,\nand who express with precision the various shades of passion, as\nthey are exhibited by vulgar minds (such as we see in the works of\nHogarth) deserve great praise; but as their genius has been\nemployed on low and confined subjects, the praise that we give must\nbe as limited as its object.  The merrymaking or quarrelling of the\nBoors of Teniers; the same sort of productions of Brouwer, or\nOstade, are excellent in their kind; and the excellence and its\npraise will be in proportion, as, in those limited subjects and\npeculiar forms, they introduce more or less of the expression of\nthose passions, as they appear in general and more enlarged nature.\nThis principle may be applied to the battle pieces of Bourgognone,\nthe French gallantries of Watteau, and even beyond the exhibition\nof animal life, to the landscapes of Claude Lorraine, and the sea-\nviews of Vandervelde.  All these painters have, in general, the\nsame right, in different degrees, to the name of a painter, which a\nsatirist, an epigrammatist, a sonnetteer, a writer of pastorals, or\ndescriptive poetry, has to that of a poet.",
        "In the same rank, and, perhaps, of not so great merit, is the cold\npainter of portraits.  But his correct and just imitation of his\nobject has its merit.  Even the painter of still life, whose\nhighest ambition is to give a minute representation of every part\nof those low objects, which he sets before him, deserves praise in\nproportion to his attainment; because no part of this excellent\nart, so much the ornament of polished life, is destitute of value\nand use.  These, however, are by no means the views to which the\nmind of the student ought to be PRIMARILY directed.  By aiming at\nbetter things, if from particular inclination, or from the taste of\nthe time and place he lives in, or from necessity, or from failure\nin the highest attempts, he is obliged to descend lower; he will\nbring into the lower sphere of art a grandeur of composition and\ncharacter that will raise and ennoble his works far above their\nnatural rank.",
        "A man is not weak, though he may not be able to wield the club of\nHercules; nor does a man always practise that which he esteems the\nbeat; but does that which he can best do.  In moderate attempts,\nthere are many walks open to the artist.  But as the idea of beauty\nis of necessity but one, so there can be but one great mode of\npainting; the leading principle of which I have endeavoured to\nexplain.",
        "I should be sorry if what is here recommended should be at all\nunderstood to countenance a careless or indetermined manner of\npainting.  For though the painter is to overlook the accidental\ndiscriminations of nature, he is to pronounce distinctly, and with\nprecision, the general forms of things.  A firm and determined\noutline is one of the characteristics of the great style in\npainting; and, let me add, that he who possesses the knowledge of\nthe exact form, that every part of nature ought to have, will be\nfond of expressing that knowledge with correctness and precision in\nall his works.",
        "To conclude:  I have endeavoured to reduce the idea of beauty to\ngeneral principles.  And I had the pleasure to observe that the\nprofessor of painting proceeded in the same method, when he showed\nyou that the artifice of contrast was founded but on one principle.\nAnd I am convinced that this is the only means of advancing\nscience, of clearing the mind from a confused heap of contradictory\nobservations, that do but perplex and puzzle the student when he\ncompares them, or misguide him if he gives himself up to their\nauthority; but bringing them under one general head can alone give\nrest and satisfaction to an inquisitive mind.",
        "Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy on the Distribution\nof the Prizes, December 10, 1771, by the President.",
        "Gentlemen,–The value and rank of every art is in proportion to the\nmental labour employed in it, or the mental pleasure produced by\nit.  As this principle is observed or neglected, our profession\nbecomes either a liberal art or a mechanical trade.  In the hands\nof one man it makes the highest pretensions, as it is addressed to\nthe noblest faculties, In those of another it is reduced to a mere\nmatter of ornament, and the painter has but the humble province of\nfurnishing our apartments with elegance.",
        "This exertion of mind, which is the only circumstance that truly\nennobles our art, makes the great distinction between the Roman and\nVenetian schools.  I have formerly observed that perfect form is\nproduced by leaving out particularities, and retaining only general\nideas.  I shall now endeavour to show that this principle, which I\nhave proved to be metaphysically just, extends itself to every part\nof the art; that it gives what is called the grand style to\ninvention, to composition, to expression, and even to colouring and\ndrapery.",
        "Invention in painting does not imply the invention of the subject,\nfor that is commonly supplied by the poet or historian.  With\nrespect to the choice, no subject can be proper that is not\ngenerally interesting.  It ought to be either some eminent instance\nof heroic action or heroic suffering.  There must be something\neither in the action or in the object in which men are universally\nconcerned, and which powerfully strikes upon the public sympathy.",
        "Strictly speaking, indeed, no subject can be of universal, hardly\ncan it be of general concern:  but there are events and characters\nso popularly known in those countries where our art is in request,\nthat they may be considered as sufficiently general for all our\npurposes.  Such are the great events of Greek and Roman fable and\nhistory, which early education and the usual course of reading have\nmade familiar and interesting to all Europe, without being degraded\nby the vulgarism of ordinary life in any country.  Such, too, are\nthe capital subjects of Scripture history, which, besides their\ngeneral notoriety, become venerable by their connection with our\nreligion.",
        "As it is required that the subject selected should be a general\none, it is no less necessary that it should be kept unembarrassed\nwith whatever may any way serve to divide the attention of the\nspectator.  Whenever a story is related, every man forms a picture\nin his mind of the action and the expression of the persons\nemployed.  The power of representing this mental picture in canvas\nis what we call invention in a painter.  And as in the conception\nof this ideal picture the mind does not enter into the minute\npeculiarities of the dress, furniture, or scene of action, so when\nthe painter comes to represent it he contrives those little\nnecessary concomitant circumstances in such a manner that they\nshall strike the spectator no more than they did himself in his\nfirst conception of the story.",
        "I am very ready to allow that some circumstances of minuteness and\nparticularity frequently tend to give an air of truth to a piece,\nand to interest the spectator in an extraordinary manner.  Such\ncircumstances, therefore, cannot wholly be rejected; but if there\nbe anything in the art which requires peculiar nicety of\ndiscernment, it is the disposition of these minute circumstantial\nparts which, according to the judgment employed in the choice,\nbecome so useful to truth or so injurious to grandeur.",
        "However, the usual and most dangerous error is on the side of\nminuteness, and, therefore, I think caution most necessary where\nmost have failed.  The general idea constitutes real excellence.\nAll smaller things, however perfect in their way, are to be\nsacrificed without mercy to the greater.  The painter will not\ninquire what things may be admitted without much censure.  He will\nnot think it enough to show that they may be there; he will show\nthat they must be there, that their absence would render his\npicture maimed and defective.",
        "Thus, though to the principal group a second or third be added, and\na second and third mass of light, care must be yet taken that these\nsubordinate actions and lights, neither each in particular, nor all\ntogether, come into any degree of competition with the principal;\nthey should make a part of that whole which would be imperfect\nwithout them.  To every part of painting this rule may be applied.\nEven in portraits, the grace and, we may add, the likeness,\nconsists more in taking the general air than in observing the\neffect similitude of every feature.",
        "Thus figures must have a ground whereon to stand; they must be\nclothed, there must be a background, there must be light and\nshadow; but none of these ought to appear to have taken up any part\nof the artist’s attention.  They should be so managed as not even\nto catch that of the spectator.  We know well enough, when we\nanalyse a piece, the difficulty and the subtlety with which an\nartist adjusts the background, drapery, and masses of light; we\nknow that a considerable part of the grace and effect of his\npicture depends upon them; but this art is so much concealed, even\nto a judicious eye, that no remains of any of these subordinate\nparts occur to memory when the picture is not present.",
        "The great end of the art is to strike the imagination.  The painter\nis, therefore, to make no ostentation of the means by which this is\ndone; the spectator is only to feel the result in his bosom.  An\ninferior artist is unwilling that any part of his industry should\nbe lost upon the spectator.  He takes as much pains to discover, as\nthe greater artist does to conceal, the marks of his subordinate\nassiduity.  In works of the lower kind everything appears studied\nand encumbered; it is all boastful art and open affectation.  The\nignorant often part from such pictures with wonder in their mouths,\nand indifference in their hearts.",
        "But it is not enough in invention that the artist should restrain\nand keep under all the inferior parts of his subject; he must\nsometimes deviate from vulgar and strict historical truth in\npursuing the grandeur of his design.",
        "How much the great style exacts from its professors to conceive and\nrepresent their subjects in a poetical manner, not confined to mere\nmatter of fact, may be seen in the cartoons of Raffaelle.  In all\nthe pictures in which the painter has represented the apostles, he\nhas drawn them with great nobleness; he has given them as much\ndignity as the human figure is capable of receiving yet we are\nexpressly told in Scripture they had no such respectable\nappearance; and of St. Paul in particular, we are told by himself,\nthat his bodily presence was mean.  Alexander is said to have been\nof a low stature:  a painter ought not so to represent him.\nAgesilaus was low, lame, and of a mean appearance.  None of these\ndefects ought to appear in a piece of which he is the hero.  In\nconformity to custom, I call this part of the art history painting;\nit ought to be called poetical, as in reality it is.",
        "All this is not falsifying any fact; it is taking an allowed\npoetical licence.  A painter of portraits retains the individual\nlikeness; a painter of history shows the man by showing his\nactions.  A painter must compensate the natural deficiencies of his\nart.  He has but one sentence to utter, but one moment to exhibit.\nHe cannot, like the poet or historian, expatiate, and impress the\nmind with great veneration for the character of the hero or saint\nhe represents, though he lets us know at the same time that the\nsaint was deformed, or the hero lame.  The painter has no other\nmeans of giving an idea of the dignity of the mind, but by that\nexternal appearance which grandeur of thought does generally,\nthough not always, impress on the countenance, and by that\ncorrespondence of figure to sentiment and situation which all men\nwish, but cannot command.  The painter, who may in this one\nparticular attain with ease what others desire in vain, ought to\ngive all that he possibly can, since there are so many\ncircumstances of true greatness that he cannot give at all.  He\ncannot make his hero talk like a great man; he must make him look\nlike one.  For which reason he ought to be well studied in the\nanalysis of those circumstances which constitute dignity of\nappearance in real life.",
        "As in invention, so likewise in, expression, care must be taken not\nto run into particularities, Those expressions alone should be\ngiven to the figures which their respective situations generally\nproduce.  Nor is this enough; each person should also have that\nexpression which men of his rank generally exhibit.  The joy or the\ngrief of a character of dignity is not to be expressed in the same\nmanner as a similar passion in a vulgar face.  Upon this principle\nBernini, perhaps, may be subject to censure.  This sculptor, in\nmany respects admirable, has given a very mean expression to his\nstatue of David, who is represented as just going to throw the\nstone from the sling; and in order to give it the expression of\nenergy he has made him biting his under-lip.  This expression is\nfar from being general, and still farther from being dignified.  He\nmight have seen it in an instance or two, and he mistook accident\nfor universality.",
        "With respect to colouring, though it may appear at first a part of\npainting merely mechanical, yet it still has its rules, and those\ngrounded upon that presiding principle which regulates both the\ngreat and the little in the study of a painter.  By this, the first\neffect of the picture is produced; and as this is performed the\nspectator, as he walks the gallery, will stop, or pass along.  To\ngive a general air of grandeur at first view, all trifling or\nartful play of little lights or an attention to a variety of tints\nis to be avoided; a quietness and simplicity must reign over the\nwhole work; to which a breadth of uniform and simple colour will\nvery much contribute.  Grandeur of effect is produced by two\ndifferent ways, which seem entirely opposed to each other.  One is,\nby reducing the colours to little more than chiaroscuro, which was\noften the practice of the Bolognian schools; and the other, by\nmaking the colours very distinct and forcible, such as we see in\nthose of Rome and Florence; but still, the presiding principle of\nboth those manners is simplicity.  Certainly, nothing can be more\nsimple than monotony, and the distinct blue, red, and yellow\ncolours which are seen in the draperies of the Roman and Florentine\nschools, though they have not that kind of harmony which is\nproduced by a variety of broken and transparent colours, have that\neffect of grandeur that was intended.  Perhaps these distinct\ncolours strike the mind more forcibly, from there not being any\ngreat union between them; as martial music, which is intended to\nrouse the noble passions, has its effect from the sudden and\nstrongly marked transitions from one note to another, which that\nstyle of music requires; whilst in that which is intended to move\nthe softer passions the notes imperceptibly melt into one another.",
        "In the same manner as the historical painter never enters into the\ndetail of colours, so neither does he debase his conceptions with\nminute attention to the discriminations of drapery.  It is the\ninferior style that marks the variety of stuffs.  With him, the\nclothing is neither woollen, nor linen, nor silk, satin, or velvet:\nit is drapery; it is nothing more.  The art of disposing the\nfoldings of the drapery make a very considerable part of the\npainter’s study.  To make it merely natural is a mechanical\noperation, to which neither genius or taste are required; whereas,\nit requires the nicest judgment to dispose the drapery, so that the\nfolds have an easy communication, and gracefully follow each other,\nwith such natural negligence as to look like the effect of chance,\nand at the same time show the figure under it to the utmost\nadvantage.",
        "Carlo Maratti was of opinion that the disposition of drapery was a\nmore difficult art than even that of drawing the human figure; that\na student might be more easily taught the latter than the former;\nas the rules of drapery, he said, could not be so well ascertained\nas those for delineating a correct form, This, perhaps, is a proof\nhow willingly we favour our own peculiar excellence.  Carlo Maratti\nis said to have valued himself particularly upon his skill in this\npart of the art yet in him the disposition appears so artificial,\nthat he is inferior to Raffaelle, even in that which gave him his\nbest claim to reputation",
        "Such is the great principle by which we must be directed in the\nnobler branches of our art.  Upon this principle the Roman, the\nFlorentine, the Bolognese schools, have formed their practice; and\nby this they have deservedly obtained the highest praise.  These\nare the three great schools of the world in the epic style.  The\nbest of the French school, Poussin, Le Sueur, and Le Brun, have\nformed themselves upon these models, and consequently may be said,\nthough Frenchmen, to be a colony from the Roman school.  Next to\nthese, but in a very different style of excellence, we may rank the\nVenetian, together with the Flemish and the Dutch schools, all\nprofessing to depart from the great purposes of painting, and\ncatching at applause by inferior qualities.",
        "I am not ignorant that some will censure me for placing the\nVenetians in this inferior class, and many of the warmest admirers\nof painting will think them unjustly degraded; but I wish not to be\nmisunderstood.  Though I can by no means allow them to hold any\nrank with the nobler schools of painting, they accomplished\nperfectly the thing they attempted.  But as mere elegance is their\nprincipal object, as they seem more willing to dazzle than to\naffect, it can be no injury to them to suppose that their practice\nis useful only to its proper end.  But what may heighten the\nelegant may degrade the sublime.  There is a simplicity, and I may\nadd, severity, in the great manner, which is, I am afraid, almost\nincompatible with this comparatively sensual style.",
        "Tintoret, Paul Veronese, and others of the Venetian schools, seem\nto have painted with no other purpose than to be admired for their\nskill and expertness in the mechanism of painting, and to make a\nparade of that art which, as I before observed, the higher style\nrequires its followers to conceal.",
        "In a conference of the French Academy, at which were present Le\nBrun, Sebastian Bourdon, and all the eminent artists of that age,\none of the academicians desired to have their opinion on the\nconduct of Paul Veronese, who, though a painter of great\nconsideration, had, contrary to the strict rules of art, in his\npicture of Perseus and Andromeda, represented the principal figure\nin shade.  To this question no satisfactory answer was then given.\nBut I will venture to say, that if they had considered the class of\nthe artist, and ranked him as an ornamental painter, there would\nhave been no difficulty in answering:  “It was unreasonable to\nexpect what was never intended.  His intention was solely to\nproduce an effect of light and Shadow; everything was to be\nsacrificed to that intent, and the capricious composition of that\npicture suited very well with the style he professed.”",
        "Young minds are indeed too apt to be captivated by this splendour\nof style, and that of the Venetians will be particularly pleasing;\nfor by them all those parts of the art that give pleasure to the\neye or sense have been cultivated with care, and carried to the\ndegree nearest to perfection.  The powers exerted in the mechanical\npart of the art have been called the language of painters; but we\nmust say, that it is but poor eloquence which only shows that the\norator can talk.  Words should be employed as the means, not as the\nend:  language is the instrument, conviction is the work.",
        "The language of painting must indeed be allowed these masters; but\neven in that they have shown more copiousness than choice, and more\nluxuriancy than judgment.  If we consider the uninteresting\nsubjects of their invention, or at least the uninteresting manner\nin which they are treated; if we attend to their capricious\ncomposition, their violent and affected contrasts, whether of\nfigures, or of light and shadow, the richness of their drapery,\nand, at the same time, the mean effect which the discrimination of\nstuffs gives to their pictures; if to these we add their total\ninattention to expression, and then reflect on the conceptions and\nthe learning of Michael Angelo, or the simplicity of Raffaelle, we\ncan no longer dwell on the comparison.  Even in colouring, if we\ncompare the quietness and chastity of the Bolognese pencil to the\nbustle and tumult that fills every part of, a Venetian picture,\nwithout the least attempt to interest the passions, their boasted\nart will appear a mere struggle without effect; an empty tale told\nby an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.",
        "Such as suppose that the great style might happily be blended with\nthe ornamental, that the simple, grave, and majestic dignity of\nRaffaelle could unite with the glow and bustle of a Paulo or\nTintoret, are totally mistaken.  The principles by which each are\nattained are so contrary to each other, that they seem, in my\nopinion, incompatible, and as impossible to exist together, as to\nunite in the mind at the same time the most sublime ideas and the\nlowest sensuality.",
        "The subjects of the Venetian painters are mostly such as give them\nan opportunity of introducing a great number of figures, such as\nfeasts, marriages, and processions, public martyrdoms, or miracles.\nI can easily conceive that Paul Veronese, if he were asked, would\nsay that no subject was proper for an historical picture but such\nas admitted at least forty figures; for in a less number, he would\nassert, there could be no opportunity of the painter’s showing his\nart in composition, his dexterity of managing and disposing the\nmasses of light, and groups of figures, and of introducing a\nvariety of Eastern dresses and characters in their rich stuffs.",
        "But the thing is very different with a pupil of the greater\nschools.  Annibale Caracci thought twelve figures sufficient for\nany story:  he conceived that more would contribute to no end but\nto fill space; that they would, be but cold spectators of the\ngeneral action, or, to use his own expression, that they would be\nfigures to be let.  Besides, it is impossible for a picture\ncomposed of so many parts to have that effect, so indispensably\nnecessary to grandeur, of one complete whole.  However\ncontradictory it may be in geometry, it is true in taste, that many\nlittle things will not make a great one.  The sublime impresses the\nmind at once with one great idea; it is a single blow:  the elegant\nindeed may be produced by a repetition, by an accumulation of many\nminute circumstances.",
        "However great the difference is between the composition of the\nVenetian and the rest of the Italian schools, there is full as\ngreat a disparity in the effect of their pictures as produced by\ncolours.  And though in this respect the Venetians must be allowed\nextraordinary skill, yet even that skill, as they have employed it,\nwill but ill correspond with the great style.  Their colouring is\nnot only too brilliant, but, I will venture to say, too harmonious\nto produce that solidity, steadiness, and simplicity of effect\nwhich heroic subjects require, and which simple or grave colours\nonly can give to a work.  That they are to be cautiously studied by\nthose who are ambitious of treading the great walk of history is\nconfirmed, if it wants confirmation, by the greatest of all\nauthorities, Michael Angelo.  This wonderful man, after having seen\na picture by Titian, told Vasari, who accompanied him, “that he\nliked much his colouring and manner; but then he added, that it was\na pity the Venetian painters did not learn to draw correctly in\ntheir early youth, and adopt a better manner of study.”",
        "By this it appears that the principal attention of the Venetian\npainters, in the opinion of Michael Angelo, seemed to be engrossed\nby the study of colours, to the neglect of the ideal beauty of\nform, or propriety of expression.  But if general censure was given\nto that school from the sight of a picture of Titian, how much more\nheavily, and more justly, would the censure fall on Paulo Veronese,\nor more especially on Tintoret?  And here I cannot avoid citing\nVasari’s opinion of the style and manner of Tintoret.  “Of all the\nextraordinary geniuses,” says he, “that have ever practised the art\nof painting, for wild, capricious, extravagant, and fantastical\ninventions, for furious impetuosity and boldness in the execution\nof his work, there is none like Tintoret; his strange whims are\neven beyond extravagance; and his works seem to be produced rather\nby chance than in consequence of any previous design, as if he\nwanted to convince the world that, the art was a trifle, and of the\nmost easy attainment.”",
        "For my own part, when I speak of the Venetian painters, I wish to\nbe understood to mean Paulo Veronese and Tintoret, to the exclusion\nof Titian; for though his style is not so pure as that of many\nother of the Italian schools, yet there is a sort of senatorial\ndignity about him, which, however awkward in his imitators, seems\nto become him exceedingly.  His portraits alone, from the nobleness\nand simplicity of character which he always gave them, will entitle\nhim to the greatest respect, as he undoubtedly stands in the first\nrank in this branch of the art.",
        "It is not with Titian, but with the seducing qualities of the two\nformer, that I could wish to caution you, against being too much\ncaptivated.  These are the persons who may be said to have\nexhausted all the powers of florid eloquence, to debauch the young\nand unexperienced, and have, without doubt, been the cause of\nturning off the attention of the connoisseur and of the patron of\nart, as well as that of the painter, from those higher excellences\nof which the art is capable, and which ought to be required in\nevery considerable production.  By them, and their imitators, a\nstyle merely ornamental has been disseminated throughout all\nEurope.  Rubens carried it to Flanders, Voet to France, and Luca\nGiordano to Spain and Naples.",
        "The Venetian is indeed the most splendid of the schools of\nelegance; and it is not without reason that the best performances\nin this lower school are valued higher than the second-rate\nperformances of those above them; for every picture has value when\nit has a decided character, and is excellent in its kind.  But the\nstudent must take care not to be so much dazzled with this\nsplendour as to be tempted to imitate what must ultimately lead\nfrom perfection.  Poussin, whose eye was always steadily fixed on\nthe sublime, has been often heard to say, “That a particular\nattention to colouring was an obstacle to the student in his\nprogress to the great end and design of the art; and that he who\nattaches himself to this principal end will acquire by practice a\nreasonably good method of colouring.”",
        "Though it be allowed that elaborate harmony of colouring, a\nbrilliancy of tints, a soft and gradual transition from one to\nanother, present to the eye what an harmonious concert of music\ndoes to the ear, it must be remembered that painting is not merely\na gratification of the sight.  Such excellence, though properly\ncultivated where nothing higher than elegance is intended, is weak\nand unworthy of regard, when the work aspires to grandeur and\nsublimity.",
        "The same reasons that have been urged why a mixture of the Venetian\nstyle cannot improve the great style will hold good in regard to\nthe Flemish and Dutch schools.  Indeed, the Flemish school, of\nwhich Rubens is the head, was formed upon that of the Venetian;\nlike them, he took his figures too much from the people before him.\nBut it must be allowed in favour of the Venetians that he was more\ngross than they, and carried all their mistaken methods to a far\ngreater excess.  In the Venetian school itself, where they all err\nfrom the same cause, there is a difference in the effect.  The\ndifference between Paulo and Bassano seems to be only that one\nintroduced Venetian gentlemen into his pictures, and the other the\nboors of the district of Bassano, and called them patriarchs and\nprophets.",
        "The painters of the Dutch school have still more locality.  With\nthem, a history piece is properly a portrait of themselves; whether\nthey describe the inside or outside of their houses, we have their\nown people engaged in their own peculiar occupations, working or\ndrinking, playing or fighting.  The circumstances that enter into a\npicture of this kind are so far from giving a general view of human\nlife that they exhibit all the minute particularities of a nation\ndiffering in several respects from the rest of mankind.  Yet, let\nthem have their share of more humble praise.  The painters of this\nschool are excellent in their own way; they are only ridiculous\nwhen they attempt general history on their own narrow principles,\nand debase great events by the meanness of their characters.",
        "Some inferior dexterity, some extraordinary mechanical power, is\napparently that from which they seek distinction.  Thus, we see,\nthat school alone has the custom of representing candle-light, not\nas it really appears to us by night, but red, as it would\nilluminate objects to a spectator by day.  Such tricks, however\npardonable in the little style, where petty effects are the sole\nend, are inexcusable in the greater, where the attention should\nnever be drawn aside by trifles, but should be entirely occupied by\nthe subject itself.",
        "The same local principles which characterise the Dutch school\nextend even to their landscape painters; and Rubens himself, who\nhas painted many landscapes, has sometimes transgressed in this\nparticular.  Their pieces in this way are, I think, always a\nrepresentation of an individual spot, and each in its kind a very\nfaithful but very confined portrait.",
        "Claude Lorraine, on the contrary, was convinced that taking nature\nas he found it seldom produced beauty.  His pictures are a\ncomposition of the various draughts which he has previously made\nfrom various beautiful scenes and prospects.  However, Rubens in\nsome measure has made amends for the deficiency with which he is\ncharged; he has contrived to raise and animate his otherwise\nuninteresting views, by introducing a rainbow, storm, or some\nparticular accidental effect of light.  That the practice of Claude\nLorraine, in respect to his choice, is to be adopted by landscape\npainters, in opposition to that of the Flemish and Dutch schools,\nthere can be no doubt, as its truth is founded upon the same\nprinciple as that by which the historical painter acquires perfect\nform.  But whether landscape painting has a right to aspire so far\nas to reject what the painters call accidents of nature is not easy\nto determine.  It is certain Claude Lorraine seldom, if ever,\navailed himself of those accidents; either he thought that such\npeculiarities were contrary to that style of general nature which\nhe professed, or that it would catch the attention too strongly,\nand destroy that quietness and repose which he thought necessary to\nthat kind of painting.",
        "A portrait painter likewise, when he attempts history, unless he is\nupon his guard, is likely to enter too much into the detail.  He\ntoo frequently makes his historical heads look like portraits; and\nthis was once the custom amongst those old painters who revived the\nart before general ideas were practised or understood.  A history\npainter paints man in general; a portrait painter, a particular\nman, and consequently a defective model.",
        "Thus an habitual practice in the lower exercises of the art will\nprevent many from attaining the greater.  But such of us who move\nin these humbler walks of the profession are not ignorant that, as\nthe natural dignity of the subject is less, the more all the little\nornamental helps are necessary to its embellishment.  It would be\nridiculous for a painter of domestic scenes, of portraits,\nlandscapes, animals, or of still life, to say that he despised\nthose qualities which have made the subordinate schools so famous.\nThe art of colouring, and the skilful management of light and\nshadow, are essential requisites in his confined labours.  If we\ndescend still lower, what is the painter of fruit and flowers\nwithout the utmost art in colouring, and what the painters call\nhandling; that is, a lightness of pencil that implies great\npractice, and gives the appearance of being done with ease?  Some\nhere, I believe, must remember a flower-painter whose boast it was\nthat he scorned to paint for the million; no, he professed to paint\nin the true Italian taste; and despising the crowd, called\nstrenuously upon the few to admire him.  His idea of the Italian\ntaste was to paint as black and dirty as he could, and to leave all\nclearness and brilliancy of colouring to those who were fonder of\nmoney than of immortality.  The consequence was such as might be\nexpected.  For these pretty excellences are here essential\nbeauties; and without this merit the artist’s work will be more\nshort-lived than the objects of his imitation.",
        "From what has been advanced, we must now be convinced that there\nare two distinct styles in history painting:  the grand, and the\nsplendid or ornamental.",
        "The great style stands alone, and does not require, perhaps does\nnot so well admit, any addition from inferior beauties.  The\nornamental style also possesses its own peculiar merit.  However,\nthough the union of the two may make a sort of composite style, yet\nthat style is likely to be more imperfect than either of those\nwhich go to its composition.  Both kinds have merit, and may be\nexcellent though in different ranks, if uniformity be preserved,\nand the general and particular ideas of nature be not mixed.  Even\nthe meanest of them is difficult enough to attain; and the first\nplace being already occupied by the great artists in either\ndepartment, some of those who followed thought there was less room\nfor them, and feeling the impulse of ambition and the desire of\nnovelty, and being at the same time perhaps willing to take the\nshortest way, they endeavoured to make for themselves a place\nbetween both.  This they have effected by forming a union of the\ndifferent orders.  But as the grave and majestic style would suffer\nby a union with the florid and gay, so also has the Venetian\nornament in some respect been injured by attempting an alliance\nwith simplicity.",
        "It may be asserted that the great style is always more or less\ncontaminated by any meaner mixture.  But it happens in a few\ninstances that the lower may be improved by borrowing from the\ngrand.  Thus, if a portrait painter is desirous to raise and\nimprove his subject, he has no other means than by approaching it\nto a general idea.  He leaves out all the minute breaks and\npeculiarities in the face, and changes the dress from a temporary\nfashion to one more permanent, which has annexed to it no ideas of\nmeanness from its being familiar to us.  But if an exact\nresemblance of an individual be considered as the sole object to be\naimed at, the portrait painter will be apt to lose more than he\ngains by the acquired dignity taken from general nature.  It is\nvery difficult to ennoble the character of a countenance but at the\nexpense of the likeness, which is what is most generally required\nby such as sit to the painter.",
        "Of those who have practised the composite style, and have succeeded\nin this perilous attempt, perhaps the foremost is Correggio.  His\nstyle is founded upon modern grace and elegance, to which is super,\nadded something of the simplicity of the grand style.  A breadth of\nlight and colour, the general ideas of the drapery, an\nuninterrupted flow of outline, all conspire to this effect.  Next\nhim (perhaps equal to him) Parmegiano has dignified the genteelness\nof modern effeminacy by uniting it with the simplicity of the\nancients and the grandeur and severity of Michael Angelo.  It must\nbe confessed, however, that these two extraordinary men, by\nendeavouring to give the utmost degree of grace, have sometimes,\nperhaps, exceeded its boundaries, and have fallen into the most\nhateful of all hateful qualities, affectation.  Indeed, it is the\npeculiar characteristic of men of genius to be afraid of coldness\nand insipidity, from which they think they never can be too far\nremoved.  It particularly happens to these great masters of grace\nand elegance.  They often boldly drive on to the very verge of\nridicule; the spectator is alarmed, but at the same time admires\ntheir vigour and intrepidity.",
        "Strange graces still, and stranger flights they had,\n. . .\nYet ne’er so sure our passion to create\nAe when they touch’d the brink of all we hate.",
        "The errors of genius, however, are pardonable, and none even of the\nmore exalted painters are wholly free from them; but they have\ntaught us, by the rectitude of their general practice, to correct\ntheir own affected or accidental deviation.  The very first have\nnot been always upon their guard, and perhaps there is not a fault\nbut what may take shelter under the most venerable authorities; yet\nthat style only is perfect in which the noblest principles are\nuniformly pursued; and those masters only are entitled to the first\nrank in, our estimation who have enlarged the boundaries of their\nart, and have raised it to its highest dignity, by exhibiting the\ngeneral ideas of nature.",
        "On the whole, it seems to me that there is but one presiding\nprinciple which regulates and gives stability to every art.  The\nworks, whether of poets, painters, moralists, or historians, which\nare built upon general nature, live for ever; while those which\ndepend for their existence on particular customs and habits, a\npartial view of nature, or the fluctuation of fashion, can only be\ncoeval with that which first raised them from obscurity.  Present\ntime and future maybe considered as rivals, and he who solicits the\none must expect to be discountenanced by the other.",
        "Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy on the Distribution\nof the Prizes, December 10, 1772, by the President.",
        "Gentlemen,–I purpose to carry on in this discourse the subject\nwhich I began in my last.  It was my wish upon that occasion to\nincite you to pursue the higher excellences of the art.  But I fear\nthat in this particular I have been misunderstood.  Some are ready\nto imagine, when any of their favourite acquirements in the art are\nproperly classed, that they are utterly disgraced.  This is a very\ngreat mistake:  nothing has its proper lustre but in its proper\nplace.  That which is most worthy of esteem in its allotted sphere\nbecomes an object, not of respect, but of derision, when it is\nforced into a higher, to which it is not suited; and there it\nbecomes doubly a source of disorder, by occupying a situation which\nis not natural to it, and by putting down from the first place what\nis in reality of too much magnitude to become with grace and\nproportion that subordinate station, to which something of less\nvalue would be much better suited.",
        "My advice in a word is this:  keep your principal attention fixed\nupon the higher excellences.  If you compass them and compass\nnothing more, you are still in the first class.  We may regret the\ninnumerable beauties which you may want:  you may be very\nimperfect:  but still, you are an imperfect person of the highest\norder.",
        "If, when you have got thus far, you can add any, or all, of the\nsubordinate qualifications, it is my wish and advice that you\nshould not neglect them.",
        "But this is as much a matter of circumspection and caution at least\nas of eagerness and pursuit.",
        "The mind is apt to be distracted by a multiplicity of pursuits; and\nthat scale of perfection, which I wish always to be preserved, is\nin the greatest danger of being totally disordered, and even\ninverted.",
        "Some excellences bear to be united, and are improved by union,\nothers are of a discordant nature; and the attempt to join them\nonly produces a harsher jarring of incongruent principles.",
        "The attempt to unite contrary excellences (of form, for instance)\nin a single figure, can never escape degenerating into the\nmonstrous, but by sinking into the insipid, taking away its marked\ncharacter, and weakening its expression.",
        "This remark is true to a certain degree with regard to the\npassions.  If you mean to preserve the most perfect beauty in its\nmost perfect state, you cannot express the passions, which produce\n(all of them) distortion and deformity, more or less, in the most\nbeautiful faces.",
        "Guido, from want of choice in adapting his subject to his ideas and\nhis powers, or in attempting to preserve beauty where it could not\nbe preserved has in this respect succeeded very ill.  His figures\nare often engaged in subjects that required great expression:  yet\nhis “Judith and Holofernes,” the “Daughter of Herodias with the\nBaptist’s Head,” the “Andromeda,” and even the “Mothers of the\nInnocents,” have little more expression than his “Venus attired by\nthe Graces.”",
        "Obvious as these remarks appear, there are many writers on our art,\nwho, not being of the profession, and consequently not knowing what\ncan or what cannot be done, have been very liberal of absurd\npraises in their descriptions of favourite works.  They always find\nin them what they are resolved to find.  They praise excellences\nthat can hardly exist together, and above all things are fond of\ndescribing with great exactness the expression of a mixed passion,\nwhich more particularly appears to me out of the reach of our art.",
        "Such are many disquisitions which I have read on some of the\ncartoons and other pictures of Raffaelle, where the critics have\ndescribed their own imagination; or indeed where the excellent\nmaster himself may have attempted this expression of passions above\nthe powers of the art; and has, therefore, by an indistinct and\nimperfect marking, left room for every imagination, with equal\nprobability to find a passion of his own.  What has been, and what\ncan be done in the art, is sufficiently difficult; we need not be\nmortified or discouraged for not being able to execute the\nconceptions of a romantic imagination.  Art has its boundaries,\nthough imagination has none.  We can easily, like the ancients,\nsuppose a Jupiter to be possessed of all those powers and\nperfections which the subordinate Deities were endowed with\nseparately.  Yet, when they employed their art to represent him,\nthey confined his character to majesty alone.  Pliny, therefore,\nthough we are under great obligations to him for the information he\nhas given us in relation to the works of the ancient artists, is\nvery frequently wrong when he speaks of them, which he does very\noften in the style of many of our modern connoisseurs.  He observes\nthat in a statue of Paris, by Fuphranor, you might discover at the\nsame time three different characters; the dignity of a judge of the\ngoddesses, the lover of Helen, and the conqueror of Achilles.  A\nstatue in which you endeavour to unite stately dignity, youthful\nelegance, and stern valour, must surely possess none of these to\nany eminent degree.",
        "From hence it appears that there is much difficulty as well as\ndanger in an endeavour to concentrate upon a single subject those\nvarious powers which, rising from different points, naturally move\nin different directions.",
        "The summit of excellence seems to be an assemblage of contrary\nqualities, but mixed, in such proportions, that no one part is\nfound to counteract the other.  How hard this is to be attained in\nevery art, those only know who have made the greatest progress in\ntheir respective professions.",
        "To conclude what I have to say on this part of the subject, which I\nthink of great importance, I wish you to understand that I do not\ndiscourage the younger students from the noble attempt of uniting\nall the excellences of art, but to make them aware that, besides\nthe difficulties which attend every arduous attempt, there is a\npeculiar difficulty in the choice of the excellences which ought to\nbe united; I wish you to attend to this, that you may try\nyourselves, whenever you are capable of that trial, what you can,\nand what you cannot do:  and that, instead of dissipating your\nnatural faculties over the immense field of possible excellence,\nyou may choose some particular walk in which you may exercise all\nyour powers, in order each of you to be the first in his way.  If\nany man shall be master of such a transcendant, commanding, and\nductile genius, as to enable him to rise to the highest, and to\nstoop to the lowest flights of art, and to sweep over all of them\nunobstructed and secure, he is fitter to give example than to\nreceive instruction.",
        "Having said thus much on the union of excellences, I will next say\nsomething of the subordination in which various excellences ought\nto be kept.",
        "I am of opinion that the ornamental style, which in my discourse of\nlast year I cautioned you against considering as principal, may not\nbe wholly unworthy the attention of those who aim even at the grand\nstyle; when it is properly placed and properly reduced.",
        "But this study will be used with far better effect, if its\nprinciples are employed in softening the harshness and mitigating\nthe rigour of the great style, than if in attempt to stand forward\nwith any pretensions of its own to positive and original\nexcellence.",
        "It was thus Lodovico Caracci, whose example I formerly recommended\nto you, employed it.  He was acquainted with the works both of\nCorreggio and the Venetian painters, and knew the principles by\nwhich they produced those pleasing effects which at the first\nglance prepossess us so much in their favour; but he took only as\nmuch from each as would embellish, but not overpower, that manly\nstrength and energy of style, which is his peculiar character.",
        "Since I have already expatiated so largely in my former discourse,\nand in my present, upon the styles and characters of painting, it\nwill not be at all unsuitable to my subject if I mention to you\nsome particulars relative to the leading principles, and capital\nworks of those who excelled in the great style, that I may bring\nyou from abstraction nearer to practice, and by exemplifying the\npropositions which I have laid down, enable you to understand more\nclearly what I would enforce.",
        "The principal works of modern art are in fresco, a mode of painting\nwhich excludes attention to minute elegancies:  yet these works in\nfresco are the productions on which the fame of the greatest\nmasters depend:  such are the pictures of Michael Angelo and\nRaffaelle in the Vatican, to which we may add the cartoons, which,\nthough not strictly to be called fresco, yet may be put under that\ndenomination; and such are the works of Giulio Romano at Mantua.\nIf these performances were destroyed, with them would be lost the\nbest part of the reputation of those illustrious painters, for\nthese are justly considered as the greatest efforts of our art\nwhich the world can boast.  To these, therefore, we should\nprincipally direct our attention for higher excellences.  As for\nthe lower arts, as they have been once discovered, they may be\neasily attained by those possessed of the former.",
        "Raffaelle, who stands in general foremost of the first painters,\nowes his reputation, as I have observed, to his excellence in the\nhigher parts of the art.  Therefore, his works in fresco ought to\nbe the first object of our study and attention.  His easel-works\nstand in a lower degree of estimation; for though he continually,\nto the day of his death, embellished his works more and more with\nthe addition of these lower ornaments, which entirely make the\nmerit of some, yet he never arrived at such perfection as to make\nhim an object of imitation.  He never was able to conquer perfectly\nthat dryness, or even littleness of manner, which he inherited from\nhis master.  He never acquired that nicety of taste in colours,\nthat breadth of light and shadow, that art and management of\nuniting light, to light, and shadow to shadow, so as to make the\nobject rise out of the ground with that plenitude of effect so much\nadmired in the works of Correggio.  When he painted in oil, his\nhand seemed to be so cramped and confined that he not only lost\nthat facility and spirit, but I think even that correctness of\nform, which is so perfect and admirable in his fresco works.  I do\nnot recollect any pictures of his of this kind, except perhaps the\n\"Transfiguration,” in which there are not some parts that appear to\nbe even feebly drawn.  That this is not a necessary attendant on\noil-painting, we have abundant instances in more modern painters.\nLodovico Caracci, for instance, preserved in his works in oil the\nsame spirit, vigour, and correctness, which he had in fresco.  I\nhave no desire to degrade Raffaelle from the high rank which he\ndeservedly holds:  but by comparing him with himself, he does not\nappear to me to be the same man in oil as in fresco.",
        "From those who have ambition to tread in this great walk of the\nart, Michael Angelo claims the next attention.  He did not possess\nso many excellences as Raffaelle, but those he had were of the\nhighest kind.  He considered the art as consisting of little more\nthan what may be attained by sculpture, correctness of form, and\nenergy of character.  We ought not to expect more than an artist\nintends in his work.  He never attempted those lesser elegancies\nand graces in the art.  Vasari says, he never painted but one\npicture in oil, and resolved never to paint another, saying it was\nan employment only fit for women and children.",
        "If any man had a right to look down upon the lower accomplishments\nas beneath his attention, it was certainly Michael Angelo:  nor can\nit be thought strange that such a mind should have slighted or have\nbeen withheld from paying due attention to all those graces and\nembellishments of art which have diffused such lustre over the\nworks of other painters.",
        "It must be acknowledged likewise, that together with these, which\nwe wish he had more attended to, he has rejected all the false\nthough specious ornaments which disgrace the works even of the most\nesteemed artists; and I will venture to say, that when those higher\nexcellences are more known and cultivated by the artists and the\npatrons of arts, his fame and credit will increase with our\nincreasing knowledge.  His name will then be held in the same\nveneration as it was in the enlightened age of Leo the Tenth:  and\nit is remarkable that the reputation of this truly great man has\nbeen continually declining as the art itself has declined.  For I\nmust remark to you, that it has long been much on the decline, and\nthat our only hope of its revival will consist in your being\nthoroughly sensible of its depravation and decay.  It is to Michael\nAngelo that we owe even the existence of Raffaelle; it is to him\nRaffaelle owes the grandeur of his style.  He was taught by him to\nelevate his thoughts, and to conceive his subjects with dignity.\nHis genius, however, formed to blaze and to shine, might, like fire\nin combustible matter, for ever have lain dormant if it had not\ncaught a spark by its contact with Michael Angelo:  and though it\nnever burst out with that extraordinary heat and vehemence, yet it\nmust be acknowledged to be a more pure, regular, and chaste flame.\nThough our judgment will upon the whole decide in favour of\nRaffaelle:  yet he never takes that firm hold and entire possession\nof the mind in such a manner as to desire nothing else, and feel\nnothing wanting.  The effect of the capital works of Michael Angelo\nperfectly correspond to what Bourchardon said he felt from reading\nHomer.  His whole frame appeared to himself to be enlarged, and all\nnature which surrounded him diminished to atoms.",
        "If we put those great artists in a light of comparison with each\nother, Raffaelle had more taste and fancy, Michael Angelo more\ngenius and imagination.  The one excelled in beauty, the other in\nenergy.  Michael Angelo has more of the poetical inspiration; his\nideas are vast and sublime; his people are a superior order of\nbeings; there is nothing about them, nothing in the air of their\nactions or their attitudes, or the style and cast of their very\nlimbs or features, that puts one in mind of their belonging, to our\nown species.  Raffaelle’s imagination is not so elevated; his\nfigures are not so much disjoined from our own diminutive race of\nbeings, though his ideas are chaste, noble, and of great conformity\nto their subjects.  Michael Angelo’s works have a strong, peculiar,\nand marked character; they seem to proceed from his own mind\nentirely, and that mind so rich and abundant, that he never needed,\nor seemed to disdain, to look abroad for foreign help.  Raffaelle’s\nmaterials are generally borrowed, though the noble structure is his\nown.  The excellency of this extraordinary man lay in the\npropriety, beauty, and majesty of his characters, his judicious\ncontrivance of his composition, correctness of drawing, purity of\ntaste, and the skilful accommodation of other men’s conceptions to\nhis own purpose.  Nobody excelled him in that judgment, with which\nhe united to his own observations on nature the energy of Michael\nAngelo, and the beauty and simplicity of the antique.  To the\nquestion, therefore, which ought to hold the first rank, Raffaelle\nor Michael Angelo, it must be answered, that if it is to be given\nto him who possessed a greater combination of the higher qualities\nof the art than any other man, there is no doubt but Raffaelle is\nthe first.  But if, according to Longinus, the sublime, being the\nhighest excellence that human composition can attain to, abundantly\ncompensates the absence of every other beauty, and atones for all\nother deficiencies, then Michael Angelo demands the preference.",
        "These two extraordinary men carried some of the higher excellences\nof the art to a greater degree of perfection than probably they\never arrived at before.  They certainly have not been excelled, nor\nequalled since.  Many of their successors were induced to leave\nthis great road as a beaten path, endeavouring to surprise and\nplease by something uncommon or new.  When this desire after\nnovelty has proceeded from mere idleness or caprice, it is not\nworth the trouble of criticism; but when it has been in consequence\nof a busy mind of a peculiar complexion, it is always striking and\ninteresting, never insipid.",
        "Such is the great style as it appears in those who possessed it at\nits height; in this, search after novelty in conception or in\ntreating the subject has no place.",
        "But there is another style, which, though inferior to the former,\nhas still great merit, because it shows that those who cultivated\nit were men of lively and vigorous imagination.  This I call the\noriginal or characteristical style; this, being less referred to\nany true architype existing either in general or particular nature,\nmust be supported by the painter’s consistency in the principles he\nhas assumed, and in the union and harmony of his whole design.  The\nexcellency of every style, but I think of the subordinate ones more\nespecially, will very much depend on preserving that union and\nharmony between all the component parts, that they appear to hang\nwell together, as if the whole proceeded from one mind.  It is in\nthe works of art, as in the characters of men.  The faults or\ndefects of some men seem to become them when they appear to be the\nnatural growth, and of a piece with the rest of their character.  A\nfaithful picture of a mind, though it be not of the most elevated\nkind, though it be irregular, wild, and incorrect, yet if it be\nmarked with that spirit and firmness which characterises works of\ngenius, will claim attention, and be more striking than a\ncombination of excellences that do not seem to hang well together,\nor we may say than a work that possesses even all excellences, but\nthose in a moderate degree.",
        "One of the strongest marked characters of this kind, which must be\nallowed to be subordinate to the great style, is that of Salvator\nRosa.  He gives us a peculiar cast of nature, which, though void of\nall grace, elegance, and simplicity; though it has nothing of that\nelevation and dignity which belongs to the grand style, yet has\nthat sort of dignity which belongs to savage and uncultivated\nnature.  But what is most to be admired in him is the perfect\ncorrespondence which he observed between the subjects which he\nchose, and his manner of treating them.  Everything is of a piece:\nhis rocks, trees, sky, even to his handling have the same rude and\nwild character which animates his figures.",
        "To him we may contrast the character of Carlo Maratti, who, in my\nown opinion, had no great vigour of mind or strength of original\ngenius.  He rarely seizes the imagination by exhibiting the higher\nexcellences, nor does he captivate us by that originality which\nattends the painter who thinks for himself.  He knew and practised\nall the rules of art, and from a composition of Raffaelle, Caracci,\nand Guido, made up a style, of which its only fault was, that it\nhad no manifest defects and no striking beauties, and that the\nprinciples of his composition are never blended together, so as to\nform one uniform body, original in its kind, or excellent in any\nview.",
        "I will mention two other painters who, though entirely dissimilar,\nyet by being each consistent with himself, and possessing a manner\nentirely his own, have both gained reputation, though for very\nopposite accomplishments.",
        "The painters I mean are Rubens and Poussin.  Rubens I mention in\nthis place, as I think him a remarkable instance of the same mind\nbeing seen in all the various parts of the art.  The whole is so\nmuch of a piece that one can scarce be brought to believe but that\nif any one of them had been more correct and perfect, his works\nwould not be so complete as they now appear.  If we should allow a\ngreater purity and correctness of drawing, his want of simplicity\nin composition, colouring, and drapery would appear more gross.",
        "In his composition his art is too apparent.  His figures have\nexpression, and act with energy, but without simplicity or dignity.\nHis colouring, in which he is eminently skilled, is,\nnotwithstanding, too much of what we call tinted.  Throughout the\nwhole of his works there is a proportionable want of that nicety of\ndistinction and elegance of mind which is required in the higher\nwalks of painting; and to this want it may be in some degree\nascribed that those qualities which make the excellency of this\nsubordinate style appear in him with their greatest lustre.\nIndeed, the facility with which he invented, the richness of his\ncomposition, the luxuriant harmony and brilliancy of his colouring,\nso dazzle the eye, that whilst his works continue before us we\ncannot help thinking that all his deficiencies are fully supplied.",
        "Opposed to this florid, careless, loose, and inaccurate style, that\nof the simple, careful, pure, and correct style of Poussin seems to\nbe a complete contrast.",
        "Yet however opposite their characters, in one thing they agreed,\nboth of them having a perfect correspondence between all the parts\nof their respective manners.",
        "One is not sure but every alteration of what is considered as\ndefective in either, would destroy the effect of the whole.",
        "Poussin lived and conversed with the ancient statues so long, that\nhe may be said to be better acquainted with then than with the\npeople who were about him.  I have often thought that he carried\nhis veneration for them so far as to wish to give his works the air\nof ancient paintings.  It is certain he copied some of the antique\npaintings, particularly the “Marriage in the Albrobrandini Palace\nat Rome,” which I believe to be the best relique of those remote\nages that has yet been found.",
        "No works of any modern has so much of the air of antique painting\nas those of Poussin.  His best performances have a remarkable\ndryness of manner, which, though by no means to be recommended for\nimitation, yet seems perfectly correspondent to that ancient\nsimplicity which distinguishes his style.  Like Polidoro he studied\nthem so much, that he acquired a habit of thinking in their way,\nand seemed to know perfectly the actions and gestures they would\nuse on every occasion.",
        "Poussin in the latter part of his life changed from his dry manner\nto one much softer and richer, where there is a greater union\nbetween the figures and the ground, such as the “Seven Sacraments\"\nin the Duke of Orleans’ collection; but neither these, nor any in\nthis manner, are at all comparable to many in his dry manner which\nwe have in England.",
        "The favourite subjects of Poussin were ancient fables; and no\npainter was ever better qualified to paint such subjects, not only\nfrom his being eminently skilled in the knowledge of ceremonies,\ncustoms, and habits of the ancients, but from his being so well\nacquainted with the different characters which those who invented\nthem gave their allegorical figures.  Though Rubens has shown great\nfancy in his Satyrs, Silenuses, and Fauns, yet they are not that\ndistinct separate class of beings which is carefully exhibited by\nthe ancients and by Poussin.  Certainly when such subjects of\nantiquity are represented, nothing in the picture ought to remind\nus of modern times.  The mind is thrown back into antiquity, and\nnothing ought to be introduced that may tend to awaken it from the\nillusion.",
        "Poussin seemed to think that the style and the language in which\nsuch stories are told is not the worse for preserving some relish\nof the old way of painting which seemed to give a general\nuniformity to the whole, so that the mind was thrown back into\nantiquity not only by the subject, but the execution.",
        "If Poussin, in imitation of the ancients, represents Apollo driving\nhis chariot out of the sea by way of representing the sun rising,\nif he personifies lakes and rivers, it is no ways offensive in him;\nbut seems perfectly of a piece with the general air of the picture.\nOn the contrary, if the figures which people his pictures had a\nmodern air or countenance, if they appeared like our countrymen, if\nthe draperies were like cloth or silk of our manufacture, if the\nlandscape had the appearance of a modern view, how ridiculous would\nApollo appear instead of the sun, an old man or a nymph with an urn\ninstead of a river or lake.",
        "I cannot avoid mentioning here a circumstance in portrait painting\nwhich may help to confirm what has been said.",
        "When a portrait is painted in the historical style, as it is\nneither an exact minute representation of an individual nor\ncompletely ideal, every circumstance ought to correspond to this\nmixture.  The simplicity of the antique air and attitude, however\nmuch to be admired, is ridiculous when joined to a figure in a\nmodern dress.  It is not to my purpose to enter into the question\nat present, whether this mixed style ought to be adopted or not;\nyet if it is chosen it is necessary it should be complete and all\nof a piece:  the difference of stuffs, for instance, which make the\nclothing, should be distinguished in the same degree as the head\ndeviates from a general idea.",
        "Without this union, which I have so often recommended, a work can\nhave no marked and determined character, which is the peculiar and\nconstant evidence of genius.  But when this is accomplished to a\nhigh degree, it becomes in some sort a rival to that style which we\nhave fixed as the highest.",
        "Thus I have given a sketch of the characters of Rubens and Salvator\nRosa, as they appear to me to have the greatest uniformity of mind\nthroughout their whole work.  But we may add to these, all these\nartists who are at the head of the class, and have had a school of\nimitators from Michael Angelo down to Watteau.  Upon the whole it\nappears that setting aside the ornamental style, there are two\ndifferent paths, either of which a student may take without\ndegrading the dignity of his art.  The first is to combine the\nhigher excellences and embellish them to the greatest advantage.\nThe other is to carry one of these excellences to the highest\ndegree.  But those who possess neither must be classed with them,\nwho, as Shakespeare says, are men of no mark or likelihood.",
        "I inculcate as frequently as I can your forming yourselves upon\ngreat principles and great models.  Your time will be much misspent\nin every other pursuit.  Small excellences should be viewed, not\nstudied; they ought to be viewed, because nothing ought to escape a\npainter’s observation, but for no other reason.",
        "There is another caution which I wish to give you.  Be as select in\nthose whom you endeavour to please, as in those whom you endeavour\nto imitate.  Without the love of fame you can never do anything\nexcellent; but by an excessive and undistinguishing thirst after\nit, you will come to have vulgar views; you will degrade your\nstyle; and your taste will be entirely corrupted.  It is certain\nthat the lowest style will be the most popular, as it falls within\nthe compass of ignorance itself; and the vulgar will always be\npleased with what is natural in the confined and misunderstood\nsense of the word.",
        "One would wish that such depravation of taste should be\ncounteracted, with such manly pride as Euripides expressed to the\nAthenians, who criticised his works, “I do not compose,” says he,\n\"my works in order to be corrected by you, but to instruct you.\"\nIt is true, to have a right to speak thus, a man must be a\nEuripides.  However, thus much may be allowed, that when an artist\nis sure that he is upon firm ground, supported by the authority and\npractice of his predecessors of the greatest reputation, he may\nthen assume the boldness and intrepidity of genius; at any rate, he\nmust not be tempted out of the right path by any tide of popularity\nthat always accompanies the lower styles of painting.",
        "I mention this, because our exhibitions, that produce such\nadmirable effects by nourishing emulation, and calling out genius,\nhave also a mischievous tendency by seducing the painter to an\nambition of pleasing indiscriminately the mixed multitude of people\nwho resort to them.",
        "Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy on the Distribution\nof the Prizes, December 10, 1774, by the President.",
        "Gentlemen,–When I have taken the liberty of addressing you on the\ncourse and order of your studies, I never proposed to enter into a\nminute detail of the art.  This I have always left to the several\nprofessors, who pursue the end of our institution with the highest\nhonour to themselves, and with the greatest advantage to the\nstudents.",
        "My purpose in the discourses I have held in the Academy is to lay\ndown certain general ideas, which seem to me proper for the\nformation of a sound taste; principles necessary to guard the\npupils against those errors into which the sanguine temper common\nat their time of life, has a tendency to lead them, and which have\nrendered abortive the hopes of so many successions of promising\nyoung men in all parts of Europe.",
        "I wish, also, to intercept and suppress those prejudices which\nparticularly prevail when the mechanism of painting is come to its\nperfection, and which when they do prevail are certain to prevail\nto the utter destruction of the higher and more valuable parts of\nthis literate and liberal profession.",
        "These two have been my principal purposes; they are still as much\nmy concern as ever; and if I repeat my own ideas on the subject,\nyou who know how fast mistake and prejudice, when neglected, gain\nground upon truth and reason, will easily excuse me.  I only\nattempt to set the same thing in the greatest variety of lights.",
        "The subject of this discourse will be imitation, as far as a\npainter is concerned in it.  By imitation I do not mean imitation\nin its largest sense, but simply the following of other masters,\nand the advantage to be drawn from the study of their works.",
        "Those who have undertaken to write on our art, and have represented\nit as a kind of inspiration, as a gift bestowed upon peculiar\nfavourites at their birth, seem to ensure a much more favourable\ndisposition from their readers, and have a much more captivating\nand liberal air, than he who goes about to examine, coldly, whether\nthere are any means by which this art may be acquired; how our mind\nmay be strengthened and expanded, and what guides will show the way\nto eminence.",
        "It is very natural for those who are unacquainted with the cause of\nanything extraordinary to be astonished at the effect, and to\nconsider it as a kind of magic.  They, who have never observed the\ngradation by which art is acquired, who see only what is the full\nresult of long labour and application of an infinite number, and\ninfinite variety of acts, are apt to conclude from their entire\ninability to do the same at once, that it is not only inaccessible\nto themselves, but can be done by those only who have some gift of\nthe nature of inspiration bestowed upon them.",
        "The travellers into the East tell us that when the ignorant\ninhabitants of these countries are asked concerning the ruins of\nstately edifices yet remaining amongst them, the melancholy\nmonuments of their former grandeur and long-lost science, they\nalways answer that they were built by magicians.  The untaught mind\nfinds a vast gulf between its own powers and these works of\ncomplicated art which it is utterly unable to fathom.  And it\nsupposes that such a void can be passed only by supernatural\npowers.",
        "And, as for artists themselves, it is by no means their interest to\nundeceive such judges, however conscious they may be of the very\nnatural means by which the extraordinary powers were acquired; our\nart being intrinsically imitative, rejects this idea of inspiration\nmore, perhaps, than any other.",
        "It is to avoid this plain confession of truth, as it should seem,\nthat this imitation of masters–indeed, almost all imitation which\nimplies a more regular and progressive method of attaining the ends\nof painting–has ever been particularly inveighed against with\ngreat keenness, both by ancient and modern writers.",
        "To derive all from native power, to owe nothing to another, is the\npraise which men, who do not much think what they are saying,\nbestow sometimes upon others, and sometimes on themselves; and\ntheir imaginary dignity is naturally heightened by a supercilious\ncensure of the low, the barren, the grovelling, the servile\nimitator.  It would be no wonder if a student, frightened by these\nterrors and disgraceful epithets, with which the poor imitators are\nso often loaded, should let fall his pencil in mere despair,\nconscious how much he has been indebted to the labours of others,\nhow little, how very little of his art was born with him; and,\nconsidering it as hopeless, to set about acquiring by the imitation\nof any human master what he is taught to suppose is matter of\ninspiration from heaven.",
        "Some allowance must be made for what is said in the gaiety or\nambition of rhetoric.  We cannot suppose that any one can really\nmean to exclude all imitation of others.  A position so wild would\nscarce deserve a serious answer, for it is apparent, if we were\nforbid to make use of the advantages which our predecessors afford\nus, the art would be always to begin, and consequently remain\nalways in its infant state; and it is a common observation that no\nart was ever invented and carried to perfection at the same time.",
        "But to bring us entirely to reason and sobriety, let it be\nobserved, that a painter must not only be of necessity an imitator\nof the works of nature, which alone is sufficient to dispel this\nphantom of inspiration, but he must be as necessarily an imitator\nof the works of other painters.  This appears more humiliating, but\nit is equally true; and no man can be an artist, whatever he may\nsuppose, upon any other terms.",
        "However, those who appear more moderate and reasonable allow that\nstudy is to begin by imitation, but that we should no longer use\nthe thoughts of our predecessors when we are become able to think\nfor ourselves.  They hold that imitation is as hurtful to the more\nadvanced student as it was advantageous to the beginner.",
        "For my own part, I confess I am not only very much disposed to lay\ndown the absolute necessity of imitation in the first stages of the\nart, but am of opinion that the study of other masters, which I\nhere call imitation, may be extended throughout our whole life\nwithout any danger of the inconveniences with which it is charged,\nof enfeebling the mind, or preventing us from giving that original\nair which every work undoubtedly ought always to have.",
        "I am, on the contrary, persuaded that by imitation only, variety,\nand even originality of invention is produced.",
        "I will go further; even genius, at least what generally is so\ncalled, is the child of imitation.  But as this appears to be\ncontrary to the general opinion, I must explain my position before\nI enforce it.",
        "Genius is supposed to be a power of producing excellences which are\nout of the reach of the rules of art–a power which no precepts can\nteach, and which no industry can acquire.",
        "This opinion of the impossibility of acquiring those beauties which\nstamp the work with the character of genius, supposes that it is\nsomething more fixed than in reality it is, and that we always do,\nand ever did agree, about what should be considered as a\ncharacteristic of genius.",
        "But the truth is that the degree of excellence which proclaims\ngenius is different in different times and different places; and\nwhat shows it to be so is that mankind have often changed their\nopinion upon this matter.",
        "When the arts were in their infancy, the power of merely drawing\nthe likeness of any object was considered as one of its greatest\nefforts.",
        "The common people, ignorant of the principles of art, talk the same\nlanguage even to this day.  But when it was found that every man\ncould be taught to do this, and a great deal more, merely by the\nobservance of certain precepts, the name of genius then shifted its\napplication, and was given only to those who added the peculiar\ncharacter of the object they represented; to those who had\ninvention, expression, grace, or dignity; or, in short, such\nqualities or excellences the producing of which could not then be\ntaught by any known and promulgated rules.",
        "We are very sure that the beauty of form, the expression of the\npassions, the art of composition, even the power of giving a\ngeneral air of grandeur to your work, is at present very much under\nthe dominion of rules.  These excellences were, heretofore,\nconsidered merely as the effects of genius; and justly, if genius\nis not taken for inspiration, but as the effect of close\nobservation and experience.",
        "He who first made any of these observations and digested them, so\nas to form an invariable principle for himself to work by, had that\nmerit; but probably no one went very far at once; and generally the\nfirst who gave the hint did not know how to pursue it steadily and\nmethodically, at least not in the beginning.  He himself worked on\nit, and improved it; others worked more, and improved farther,\nuntil the secret was discovered, and the practice made as general\nas refined practice can be made.  How many more principles may be\nfixed and ascertained we cannot tell; but as criticism is likely to\ngo hand in hand with the art which is its subject, we may venture\nto say that as that art shall advance, its powers will be still\nmore and more fixed by rules.",
        "But by whatever strides criticism may gain ground, we need be under\nno apprehension that invention will ever be annihilated or subdued,\nor intellectual energy be brought entirely within the restraint of\nwritten law.  Genius will still have room enough to expatiate, and\nkeep always the same distance from narrow comprehension and\nmechanical performance.",
        "What we now call genius begins, not where rules, abstractedly\ntaken, end, but where known vulgar and trite rules have no longer\nany place.  It must of necessity be that even works of genius, as\nwell as every other effect, as it must have its cause, must\nlikewise have its rules; it cannot be by chance that excellences\nare produced with any constancy, or any certainty, for this is not\nthe nature of chance, but the rules by which men of extraordinary\nparts, and such as are called men of genius work, are either such\nas they discover by their own peculiar observation, or of such a\nnice texture as not easily to admit handling or expressing in\nwords, especially as artists are not very frequently skilful in\nthat mode of communicating ideas.",
        "Unsubstantial, however, as these rules may seem, and difficult as\nit may be to convey them in writing, they are still seen and felt\nin the mind of the artist, and he works from them with as much\ncertainty as if they were embodied, as I may say, upon paper.  It\nis true these refined principles cannot be always made palpable,\nlike the more gross rules of art; yet it does not follow but that\nthe mind may be put in such a train that it shall perceive, by a\nkind of scientific sense, that propriety which words, particularly\nwords of unpractised writers such as we are, can but very feebly\nsuggest.",
        "Invention is one of the great marks of genius, but if we consult\nexperience, we shall find that it is by being conversant with the\ninventions of others that we learn to invent, as by reading the\nthoughts of others we learn to think.",
        "Whoever has so far formed his taste as to be able to relish and\nfeel the beauties of the great masters has gone a great way in his\nstudy; for, merely from a consciousness of this relish of the\nright, the mind swells with an inward pride, and is almost as\npowerfully affected as if it had itself produced what it admires.\nOur hearts frequently warmed in this manner by the contact of those\nwhom we wish to resemble, will undoubtedly catch something of their\nway of thinking, and we shall receive in our own bosoms some\nradiation at least of their fire and splendour.  That disposition,\nwhich is so strong in children, still continues with us, of\ncatching involuntarily the general air and manner of those with\nwhom we are most conversant; with this difference only, that a\nyoung mind is naturally pliable and imitative, but in a more\nadvanced state it grows rigid, and must be warmed and softened\nbefore it will receive a deep impression.",
        "From these considerations, which a little of your reflection will\ncarry a great way further, it appears of what great consequence it\nis that our minds should be habituated to the contemplation of\nexcellence, and that, far from being contented to make such habits\nthe discipline of our youth only, we should, to the last moment of\nour lives, continue a settled intercourse with all the true\nexamples of grandeur.  Their inventions are not only the food of\nour infancy, but the substance which supplies the fullest maturity\nof our vigour.",
        "The mind is but a barren soil; is a soil soon exhausted, and will\nproduce no crop, or only one, unless it be continually fertilised\nand enriched with foreign matter.",
        "When we have had continually before us the great works of art to\nimpregnate our minds with kindred ideas, we are then, and not till\nthen, fit to produce something, of the same species.  We behold all\nabout us with the eyes of these penetrating observers, and our\nminds, accustomed to think the thoughts of the noblest and\nbrightest intellects, are prepared for the discovery and selection\nof all that is great and noble in nature.  The greatest natural\ngenius cannot subsist on its own stock:  he who resolves never to\nransack any mind but his own will be soon reduced, from mere\nbarrenness, to the poorest of all imitations; he will be obliged to\nimitate himself, and to repeat what he has before often repeated.\nWhen we know the subject designed by such men, it will never be\ndifficult to guess what kind of work is to be produced.",
        "It is vain for painters or poets to endeavour to invent without\nmaterials on which the mind may work, and from which invention must\noriginate.  Nothing can come of nothing.",
        "Homer is supposed to be possessed of all the learning of his time.\nAnd we are certain that Michael Angelo and Raffaelle were equally\npossessed of all knowledge in the art which was discoverable in the\nworks of their predecessors.",
        "A mind enriched by an assemblage of all the treasures of ancient\nand modern art will be more elevated and fruitful in resources in\nproportion to the number of ideas which have been carefully\ncollected and thoroughly digested.  There can be no doubt that he\nwho has the most materials has the greatest means of invention; and\nif he has not the power of using them, it must proceed from a\nfeebleness of intellect or from the confused manner in which those\ncollections have been laid up in his mind.",
        "The addition of other men’s judgment is so far from weakening, as\nis the opinion of many, our own, that it will fashion and\nconsolidate those ideas of excellence which lay in their birth\nfeeble, ill-shaped, and confused, but which are finished and put in\norder by the authority and practice of those whose works may be\nsaid to have been consecrated by having stood the test of ages.",
        "The mind, or genius, has been compared to a spark of fire which is\nsmothered by a heap of fuel and prevented from blazing into a\nflame.  This simile, which is made use of by the younger Pliny, may\nbe easily mistaken for argument or proof.",
        "There is no danger of the mind’s being over-burdened with\nknowledge, or the genius extinguished by any addition of images; on\nthe contrary, these acquisitions may as well, perhaps better, be\ncompared, if comparisons signified anything in reasoning, to the\nsupply of living embers, which will contribute to strengthen the\nspark that without the association of more would have died away.",
        "The truth is, he whose feebleness is such as to make other men’s\nthoughts an incumbrance to him can have no very great strength of\nmind or genius of his own to be destroyed, so that not much harm\nwill be done at worst.",
        "We may oppose to Pliny the greater authority of Cicero, who is\ncontinually enforcing the necessity of this method of study.  In\nhis dialogue on Oratory he makes Crassus say, that one of the first\nand most important precepts is to choose a proper model for our\nimitation.  Hoc fit primum in preceptis meis ut demonstremus quem\nimitemur.",
        "When I speak of the habitual imitation and continued study of\nmasters, it is not to be understood that I advise any endeavour to\ncopy the exact peculiar colour and complexion of another man’s\nmind; the success of such an attempt must always be like his who\nimitates exactly the air, manner, and gestures of him whom he\nadmires.  His model may be excellent, but the copy will be\nridiculous; this ridicule does not arise from his having imitated,\nbut from his not having chosen the right mode of imitation.",
        "It is a necessary and warrantable pride to disdain to walk\nservilely behind any individual, however elevated his rank.  The\ntrue and liberal ground of imitation is an open field, where,\nthough he who precedes has had the advantage of starting before\nyou, yet it is enough to pursue his course; you need not tread in\nhis footsteps, and you certainly have a right to outstrip him if\nyou can.",
        "Nor, whilst I recommend studying the art from artists, can I be\nsupposed to mean that nature is to be neglected?  I take this study\nin aid and not in exclusion of the other.  Nature is, and must be,\nthe fountain which alone is inexhaustible; and from which all\nexcellences must originally flow.",
        "The great use of studying our predecessors is to open the mind, to\nshorten our labour, and to give us the result of the selection made\nby those great minds of what is grand or beautiful in nature:  her\nrich stores are all spread out before us; but it is an art, and no\neasy art, to know how or what to choose, and how to attain and\nsecure the object of our choice.",
        "Thus the highest beauty of form must be taken from nature; but it\nis an art of long deduction and great experience to know how to\nfind it.",
        "We must not content ourselves with merely admiring and relishing;\nwe must enter into the principles on which the work is wrought;\nthese do not swim on the superficies, and consequently are not open\nto superficial observers.",
        "Art in its perfection is not ostentatious; it lies hid, and works\nits effect itself unseen.  It is the proper study and labour of an\nartist to uncover and find out the latent cause of conspicuous\nbeauties, and from thence form principles for his own conduct; such\nan examination is a continual exertion of the mind, as great,\nperhaps, as that of the artist whose works he is thus studying.",
        "The sagacious imitator not only remarks what distinguishes the\ndifferent manner or genius of each master; he enters into the\ncontrivance in the composition, how the masses of lights are\ndisposed, the means by which the effect is produced, how artfully\nsome parts are lost in the ground, others boldly relieved, and how\nall these are mutually altered and interchanged according to the\nreason and scheme of the work.  He admires not the harmony of\ncolouring alone, but he examines by what artifice one colour is a\nfoil to its neighbour.  He looks close into the tints, of what\ncolours they are composed, till he has formed clear and distinct\nideas, and has learnt to see in what harmony and good colouring\nconsists.  What is learnt in this manner from the works of others\nbecomes really our own, sinks deep, and is never forgotten; nay, it\nis by seizing on this clue that we proceed forward, and get further\nand further in enlarging the principle and improving the practice.",
        "There can be no doubt but the art is better learnt from the works\nthemselves than from the precepts which are formed upon these\nworks; but if it is difficult to choose proper models for\nimitation, it requires no less circumspection to separate and\ndistinguish what in those models we ought to imitate.",
        "I cannot avoid mentioning here, though it is not my intention at\npresent to enter into the art and method of study, an error which\nstudents are too apt to fall into.",
        "He that is forming himself must look with great caution and\nwariness on those peculiarities, or prominent parts, which at first\nforce themselves upon view, and are the marks, or what is commonly\ncalled the manner, by which that individual artist is\ndistinguished.",
        "Peculiar marks I hold to be generally, if not always, defects,\nhowever difficult it may be, wholly to escape them.",
        "Peculiarities in the works of art are like those in the human\nfigure; it is by them that we are cognisable and distinguished one\nfrom another, but they are always so many blemishes, which,\nhowever, both in the one case and in the other, cease to appear\ndeformities to those who have them continually before their eyes.\nIn the works of art, even the most enlightened mind, when warmed by\nbeauties of the highest kind, will by degrees find a repugnance\nwithin him to acknowledge any defects; nay, his enthusiasm will\ncarry him so far as to transform them into beauties and objects of\nimitation.",
        "It must be acknowledged that a peculiarity of style, either from\nits novelty, or by seeming to proceed from a peculiar turn of mind,\noften escapes blame; on the contrary, it is sometimes striking and\npleasing; but this it is vain labour to endeavour to imitate,\nbecause novelty and peculiarity being its only merit, when it\nceases to be new, it ceases to have value.",
        "A manner, therefore, being a defect, and every painter, however\nexcellent, having a manner, it seems to follow that all kinds of\nfaults, as well as beauties, may be learned under the sanction of\nthe greatest authorities.",
        "Even the great name of Michael Angelo may be used to keep in\ncountenance a deficiency, or rather neglect of colouring, and every\nother ornamental part of the art.",
        "If the young student is dry and hard, Poussin is the same.  If his\nwork has a careless and unfinished air, he has most of the Venetian\nSchool to support him.  If he makes no selection of objects, but\ntakes individual nature just as he finds it, he is like Rembrandt.\nIf he is incorrect in the proportions of his figures, Correggio was\nlikewise incorrect.  If his colours are not blended and united,\nRubens was equally crude.",
        "In short, there is no defect but may be excused, if it is a\nsufficient excuse that it can be imputed to considerable artists;\nbut it must be remembered that it was not by these defects they\nacquired their reputation:  they have a right to our pardon, but\nnot to our admiration.",
        "However, to imitate peculiarities or mistake defects for beauties\nthat man will be most liable who confines his imitation to one\nfavourite master; and, even though he chooses the best, and is\ncapable of distinguishing the real excellences of his model, it is\nnot by such narrow practice that a genius or mastery in the art is\nacquired.  A man is as little likely to form a true idea of the\nperfection of the art by studying a single artist as he would be of\nproducing a perfectly beautiful figure by an exact imitation of any\nindividual living model.",
        "And as the painter, by bringing together in one piece those\nbeauties which are dispersed amongst a great variety of\nindividuals, produces a figure more beautiful than can be found in\nnature, so that artist who can unite in himself the excellences of\nthe various painters, will approach nearer to perfection than any\none of his masters.",
        "He who confines himself to the imitation of an individual, as he\nnever proposes to surpass, so he is not likely to equal, the object\nof imitation.  He professes only to follow, and he that follows\nmust necessarily be behind.",
        "We should imitate the conduct of the great artists in the course of\ntheir studies, as well as the works which they produced, when they\nwere perfectly formed.  Raffaelle began by imitating implicitly the\nmanner of Pietro Perugino, under whom he studied; so his first\nworks are scarce to be distinguished from his master’s; but soon\nforming higher and more extensive views, he imitated the grand\noutline of Michael Angelo.  He learnt the manner of using colours\nfrom the works of Leonardo da Vinci and Fratre Bartolomeo:  to all\nthis he added the contemplation of all the remains of antiquity\nthat were within his reach, and employed others to draw for him\nwhat was in Greece and distant places.  And it is from his having\ntaken so many models that he became himself a model for all\nsucceeding painters, always imitating, and always original.",
        "If your ambition therefore be to equal Raffaelle, you must do as\nRaffaelle did; take many models, and not take even him for your\nguide alone to the exclusion of others.  And yet the number is\ninfinite of those who seem, if one may judge by their style, to\nhave seen no other works but those of their master, or of some\nfavourite whose manner is their first wish and their last.",
        "I will mention a few that occur to me of this narrow, confined,\nilliberal, unscientific, and servile kind of imitators.  Guido was\nthus meanly copied by Elizabetta Sirani, and Simone Cantarini;\nPoussin, by Verdier and Cheron; Parmigiano, by Jeronimo Mazzuoli;\nPaolo Veronese and Iacomo Bassan had for their imitators their\nbrothers and sons; Pietro de Cortona was followed by Ciro Ferri and\nRomanelli; Rubens, by Jacques Jordans and Diepenbeck; Guercino, by\nhis own family, the Gennari; Carlo Marratti was imitated by\nGiuseppe Chiari and Pietro da Pietri; and Rembrandt, by Bramer,\nEckhout, and Flink.  All these, to whom may be added a much longer\nlist of painters, whose works among the ignorant pass for those of\ntheir masters, are justly to be censured for barrenness and\nservility.",
        "To oppose to this list a few that have adopted a more liberal style\nof imitation:  Pelegrino Tibaldi, Rosso, and Primaticio did not\ncoldly imitate, but caught something of the fire that animates the\nworks of Michael Angelo.  The Carraches formed their style from\nPelegrino Tibaldi, Correggio, and the Venetian School.\nDomenichino, Guido, Lanfranco, Albano, Guercino, Cavidone,\nSchidone, Tiarini, though it is sufficiently apparent that they\ncame from the School of the Carraches, have yet the appearance of\nmen who extended their views beyond the model that lay before them,\nand have shown that they had opinions of their own, and thought for\nthemselves, after they had made themselves masters of the general\nprinciples of their schools.",
        "Le Seure’s first manner resembles very much that of his master\nVovet:  but as he soon excelled him, so he differed from him in\nevery part of the art.  Carlo Marratti succeeded better than those\nI have first named, and I think owes his superiority to the\nextension of his views; besides his master Andrea Sacchi, he\nimitated Raffaelle, Guido, and the Carraches.  It is true, there is\nnothing very captivating in Carlo Marratti; but this proceeded from\nwants which cannot be completely supplied; that is, want of\nstrength of parts.  In this, certainly men are not equal, and a man\ncan bring home wares only in proportion to the capital with which\nhe goes to market.  Carlo, by diligence, made the most of what he\nhad; but there was undoubtedly a heaviness about him, which\nextended itself, uniformly to his invention, expression, his\ndrawing, colouring, and the general effect of his pictures.  The\ntruth is, he never equalled any of his patterns in any one thing,\nand he added little of his own.",
        "But we must not rest contented, even in this general study of the\nmoderns; we must trace back the art to its fountain head, to that\nsource from whence they drew their principal excellences, the\nmonuments of pure antiquity.",
        "All the inventions and thoughts of the ancients, whether conveyed\nto us in statues, bas-reliefs, intaglios, cameos, or coins, are to\nbe sought after and carefully studied:  The genius that hovers over\nthese venerable relics may be called the father of modern art.",
        "From the remains of the works of the ancients the modern arts were\nrevived, and it is by their means that they must be restored a\nsecond time.  However it may mortify our vanity, we must be forced\nto allow them our masters; and we may venture to prophecy, that\nwhen they shall cease to be studied, arts will no longer flourish,\nand we shall again relapse into barbarism.",
        "The fire of the artist’s own genius operating upon these materials\nwhich have been thus diligently collected, will enable him to make\nnew combinations, perhaps, superior to what had ever before been in\nthe possession of the art.  As in the mixture of the variety of\nmetals, which are said to have been melted and run together at the\nburning of Corinth, a new and till then unknown metal was produced\nequal in value to any of those that had contributed to its\ncomposition.  And though a curious refiner may come with his\ncrucibles, analyse and separate its various component parts, yet\nCorinthian brass would still hold its rank amongst the most\nbeautiful and valuable of metals.",
        "We have hitherto considered the advantages of imitation as it tends\nto form the taste, and as a practice by which a spark of that\ngenius may be caught which illumines these noble works, that ought\nalways to be present to our thoughts.",
        "We come now to speak of another kind of imitation; the borrowing a\nparticular thought, an action, attitude, or figure, and\ntransplanting it into your own work:  this will either come under\nthe charge of plagiarism, or be warrantable, and deserve\ncommendation, according to the address with which it is performed.\nThere is some difference likewise whether it is upon the ancients\nor the moderns that these depredations are made.  It is generally\nallowed that no man need be ashamed of copying the ancients:  their\nworks are considered as a magazine of common property, always open\nto the public, whence every man has a right to what materials he\npleases; and if he has the art of using them, they are supposed to\nbecome to all intents and purposes his own property.",
        "The collection which Raffaelle made of the thoughts of the ancients\nwith so much trouble, is a proof of his opinion on this subject.\nSuch collections may be made with much more ease, by means of an\nart scarce known in his time; I mean that of engraving, by which,\nat an easy rate, every man may now avail himself of the inventions\nof antiquity.",
        "It must be acknowledged that the works of the moderns are more the\nproperty of their authors; he who borrows an idea from an artist,\nor perhaps from a modern, not his contemporary, and so accommodates\nit to his own work that it makes a part of it, with no seam or\njoining appearing, can hardly be charged with plagiarism; poets\npractise this kind of borrowing without reserve.  But an artist\nshould not be contented with this only; he should enter into a\ncompetition with his original, and endeavour to improve what he is\nappropriating to his own work.  Such imitation is so far from\nhaving anything in it of the servility of plagiarism, that it is a\nperpetual exercise of the mind, a continual invention.",
        "Borrowing or stealing with such art and caution will have a right\nto the same lenity as was used by the Lacedemonians; who did not\npunish theft, but the want of artifice to conceal it.",
        "In order to encourage you to imitation, to the utmost extent, let\nme add, that very finished artists in the inferior branches of the\nart will contribute to furnish the mind and give hints of which a\nskilful painter, who is sensible of what he wants, and is in no\ndanger of being infected by the contact of vicious models, will\nknow how to avail himself.  He will pick up from dunghills what by\na nice chemistry, passing through his own mind, shall be converted\ninto pure gold; and, under the rudeness of Gothic essays, he will\nfind original, rational, and even sublime inventions.",
        "In the luxuriant style of Paul Veronese, in the capricious\ncompositions of Tintoret, he will find something that will assist\nhis invention, and give points, from which his own imagination\nshall rise and take flight, when the subject which he treats will,\nwith propriety, admit of splendid effects.",
        "In every school, whether Venetian, French, or Dutch, he will find\neither ingenious compositions, extraordinary effects, some peculiar\nexpressions, or some mechanical excellence, well worthy his\nattention and, in some measure, of his imitation; even in the lower\nclass of the French painters, great beauties are often found united\nwith great defects.",
        "Though Coypel wanted a simplicity of taste, and mistook a\npresumptuous and assuming air for what is grand and majestic; yet\nhe frequently has good sense and judgment in his manner of telling\nhis stories, great skill in his compositions, and is not without a\nconsiderable power of expressing the passions, The modern\naffectation of grace in his works, as well as in those of Bouche\nand Watteau, may be said to be separated by a very thin partition\nfrom the more simple and pure grace of Correggio and Parmigiano.",
        "Amongst the Dutch painters, the correct, firm, and determined\npencil, which was employed by Bamboccio and Jan Miel on vulgar and\nmean subjects, might without any change be employed on the highest,\nto which, indeed, it seems more properly to belong.  The greatest\nstyle, if that style is confined to small figures such as Poussin\ngenerally painted, would receive an additional grace by the\nelegance and precision of pencil so admirable in the works of\nTeniers.",
        "Though this school more particularly excelled in the mechanism of\npainting, yet there are many who have shown great abilities in\nexpressing what must be ranked above mechanical excellences.",
        "In the works of Frank Hals the portrait painter may observe the\ncomposition of a face, the features well put together as the\npainters express it, from whence proceeds that strong marked\ncharacter of individual nature which is so remarkable in his\nportraits, and is not to be found in an equal degree in any other\npainter.  If he had joined to this most difficult part of the art a\npatience in finishing what he had so correctly planned, he might\njustly have claimed the place which Vandyke, all things considered,\nso justly holds as the first of portrait painters.",
        "Others of the same school have shown great power in expressing the\ncharacter and passions of those vulgar people which are the\nsubjects of their study and attention.  Amongst those, Jean Stein\nseems to be one of the most diligent and accurate observers of what\npassed in those scenes which he frequented, and which were to him\nan academy.  I can easily imagine that if this extraordinary man\nhad had the good fortune to have been born in Italy instead of\nHolland, had he lived in Rome instead of Leyden, and had been\nblessed with Michael Angelo and Raffaelle for his masters instead\nof Brower and Van Gowen, that the same sagacity and penetration\nwhich distinguished so accurately the different characters and\nexpression in his vulgar figures, would, when exerted in the\nselection and imitation of what was great and elevated in nature,\nhave been equally successful, and his name would have been now\nranged with the great pillars and supporters of our art.",
        "Men who, although thus bound down by the almost invincible powers\nof early habits, have still exerted extraordinary abilities within\ntheir narrow and confined circle, and have, from the natural vigour\nof their mind, given such an interesting expression, such force and\nenergy to their works, though they cannot be recommended to be\nexactly imitated, may yet invite an artist to endeavour to\ntransfer, by a kind of parody, those excellences to his own works.\nWhoever has acquired the power of making this use of the Flemish,\nVenetian, and French schools is a real genius, and has sources of\nknowledge open to him which were wanting to the great artists who\nlived in the great age of painting.",
        "To find excellences however dispersed, to discover beauties however\nconcealed by the multitude of defects with which they are\nsurrounded, can be the work only of him who, having a mind always\nalive to his art, has extended his views to all ages and to all\nschools, and has acquired from that comprehensive mass which he has\nthus gathered to himself, a well digested and perfect idea of his\nart, to which everything is referred.  Like a sovereign judge and\narbiter of art, he is possessed of that presiding power which\nseparates and attracts every excellence from every school, selects\nboth from what is great and what is little, brings home knowledge\nfrom the east and from the west, making the universe tributary\ntowards furnishing his mind and enriching his works with\noriginality and variety of inventions.",
        "Thus I have ventured to give my opinion of what appears to me the\ntrue and only method by which an artist makes himself master of his\nprofession, which I hold ought to be one continued course of\nimitation, that is not to cease but with our lives.",
        "Those who, either from their own engagements and hurry of business,\nor from indolence, or from conceit and vanity, have neglected\nlooking out of themselves, as far as my experience and observation\nreaches, have from that time not only ceased to advance and improve\nin their performance, but have gone backward.  They may be compared\nto men who have lived upon their principal till they are reduced to\nbeggary and left without resources.",
        "I can recommend nothing better, therefore, than that you endeavour\nto infuse into your works what you learn from the contemplation of\nthe works of others.  To recommend this has the appearance of\nneedless and superfluous advice, but it has fallen within my own\nknowledge that artists, though they are not wanting in a sincere\nlove for their art, though they have great pleasure in seeing good\npictures, and are well skilled to distinguish what is excellent or\ndefective in them, yet go on in their own manner, without any\nendeavour to give a little of those beauties which they admire in\nothers, to their own works.  It is difficult to conceive how the\npresent Italian painters, who live in the midst of the treasures of\nart, should be contented with their own style.  They proceed in\ntheir common-place inventions, and never think it worth while to\nvisit the works of those great artists with which they are\nsurrounded.",
        "I remember several years ago to have conversed at Rome with an\nartist of great fame throughout Europe; he was not without a\nconsiderable degree of abilities, but those abilities were by no\nmeans equal to his own opinion of them.  From the reputation he had\nacquired he too fondly concluded that he stood in the same rank,\nwhen compared to his predecessors, as he held with regard to his\nmiserable contemporary rivals.",
        "In conversation about some particulars of the works of Raffaelle,\nhe seemed to have, or to affect to have, a very obscure memory of\nthem.  He told me that he had not set his foot in the Vatican for\nfifteen years together; that indeed he had been in treaty to copy a\ncapital picture of Raffaelle, but that the business had gone off;\nhowever, if the agreement had held, his copy would have greatly\nexceeded the original.  The merit of this artist, however great we\nmay suppose it, I am sure would have been far greater, and his\npresumption would have been far less if he had visited the Vatican,\nas in reason he ought to have done, once at least every month of\nhis life.",
        "I address myself, gentlemen, to you who have made some progress in\nthe art, and are to be for the future under the guidance of your\nown judgment and discretion",
        "I consider you as arrived to that period when you have a right to\nthink for yourselves, and to presume that every man is fallible; to\nstudy the masters with a suspicion that great men are not always\nexempt from great faults; to criticise, compare, and rank their\nworks in your own estimation, as they approach to or recede from\nthat standard of perfection which you have formed in your own mind,\nbut which those masters themselves, it must be remembered, have\ntaught you to make, and which you will cease to make with\ncorrectness when you cease to study them.  It is their excellences\nwhich have taught you their defects.",
        "I would wish you to forget where you are, and who it is that speaks\nto you.  I only direct you to higher models and better advisers.\nWe can teach you here but very little; you are henceforth to be\nyour own teachers.  Do this justice, however, to the English\nAcademy, to bear in mind, that in this place you contracted no\nnarrow habits, no false ideas, nothing that could lead you to the\nimitation of any living master, who may be the fashionable darling\nof the day.  As you have not been taught to flatter us, do not\nlearn to flatter yourselves.  We have endeavoured to lead you to\nthe admiration of nothing but what is truly admirable.  If you\nchoose inferior patterns, or if you make your own FORMER works,\nyour patterns for your LATTER, it is your own fault.",
        "The purpose of this discourse, and, indeed, of most of my others,\nis to caution you against that false opinion, but too prevalent\namongst artists, of the imaginary power of native genius, and its\nsufficiency in great works.  This opinion, according to the temper\nof mind it meets with, almost always produces, either a vain\nconfidence, or a sluggish despair, both equally fatal to all\nproficiency.",
        "Study, therefore, the great works of the great masters for ever.\nStudy as nearly as you can, in the order, in the manner, on the\nprinciples, on which they studied.  Study nature attentively, but\nalways with those masters in your company; consider them as models\nwhich you are to imitate, and at the same time as rivals which you\nare to combat.",
        "Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy on the Distribution\nof the Prizes, December 10th, 1776, by the President.",
        "Gentlemen,–It has been my uniform endeavour, since I first\naddressed you from this place, to impress you strongly with one\nruling idea.  I wished you to be persuaded, that success in your\nart depends almost entirely on your own industry; but the industry\nwhich I principally recommended, is not the industry of the HANDS,\nbut of the MIND.",
        "As our art is not a divine gift, so neither is it a mechanical\ntrade.  Its foundations are laid in solid science.  And practice,\nthough essential to perfection, can never attain that to which it\naims, unless it works under the direction of principle.",
        "Some writers upon art carry this point too far, and suppose that\nsuch a body of universal and profound learning is requisite, that\nthe very enumeration of its kind is enough to frighten a beginner.\nVitruvius, after going through the many accomplishments of nature,\nand the many acquirements of learning, necessary to an architect,\nproceeds with great gravity to assert that he ought to be well\nskilled in the civil law, that he may not be cheated in the title\nof the ground he builds on.",
        "But without such exaggeration, we may go so far as to assert, that\na painter stands in need of more knowledge than is to be picked off\nhis pallet, or collected by looking on his model, whether it be in\nlife or in picture.  He can never be a great artist who is grossly\nilliterate.",
        "Every man whose business is description ought to be tolerably\nconversant with the poets in some language or other, that he may\nimbibe a poetical spirit and enlarge his stock of ideas.  He ought\nto acquire a habit of comparing and divesting his notions.  He\nought not to be wholly unacquainted with that part of philosophy\nwhich gives him an insight into human nature, and relates to the\nmanners, characters, passions, and affections.  He ought to know\nsomething concerning the mind, as well as a great deal concerning\nthe body of man.",
        "For this purpose, it is not necessary that he should go into such a\ncompass of reading, as must, by distracting his attention,\ndisqualify him for the practical part of his profession, and make\nhim sink the performer in the critic.  Reading, if it can be made\nthe favourite recreation of his leisure hours, will improve and\nenlarge his mind without retarding his actual industry.",
        "What such partial and desultory reading cannot afford, may be\nsupplied by the conversation of learned and ingenious men, which is\nthe best of all substitutes for those who have not the means or\nopportunities of deep study.  There are many such men in this age;\nand they will be pleased with communicating their ideas to artists,\nwhen they see them curious and docile, if they are treated with\nthat respect and deference which is so justly their due.  Into such\nsociety, young artists, if they make it the point of their\nambition, will by degrees be admitted.  There, without formal\nteaching, they will insensibly come to feel and reason like those\nthey live with, and find a rational and systematic taste\nimperceptibly formed in their minds, which they will know how to\nreduce to a standard, by applying general truth to their own\npurposes, better perhaps than those to whom they owed the original\nsentiment.",
        "Of these studies and this conversation, the desired and legitimate\noffspring is a power of distinguishing right from wrong, which\npower applied to works of art is denominated taste.  Let me then,\nwithout further introduction, enter upon an examination whether\ntaste be so far beyond our reach as to be unattainable by care, or\nbe so very vague and capricious that no care ought to be employed\nabout it.",
        "It has been the fate of arts to be enveloped in mysterious and\nincomprehensible language, as if it was thought necessary that even\nthe terms should correspond to the idea entertained of the\ninstability and uncertainty of the rules which they expressed.",
        "To speak of genius and taste as any way connected with reason or\ncommon sense, would be, in the opinion of some towering talkers, to\nspeak like a man who possessed neither, who had never felt that\nenthusiasm, or, to use their own inflated language, was never\nwarmed by that Promethean fire, which animates the canvas and\nvivifies the marble.",
        "If, in order to be intelligible, I appear to degrade art by\nbringing her down from her visionary situation in the clouds, it is\nonly to give her a more solid mansion upon the earth.  It is\nnecessary that at some time or other we should see things as they\nreally are, and not impose on ourselves by that false magnitude\nwith which objects appear when viewed indistinctly as through a\nmist.",
        "We will allow a poet to express his meaning, when his meaning is\nnot well known to himself, with a certain degree of obscurity, as\nit is one source of the sublime.  But when, in plain prose, we\ngravely talk of courting the muse in shady bowers, waiting the call\nand inspiration of genius, finding out where he inhabits, and where\nhe is to be invoked with the greatest success; of attending to\ntimes and seasons when the imagination shoots with the greatest\nvigour, whether at the summer solstice or the equinox, sagaciously\nobserving how much the wild freedom and liberty of imagination is\ncramped by attention to established rules, and how this same\nimagination begins to grow dim in advanced age, smothered and\ndeadened by too much judgment.  When we talk such language, or\nentertain such sentiments as these, we generally rest contented\nwith mere words, or at best entertain notions not only groundless,\nbut pernicious.",
        "If all this means what it is very possible was originally intended\nonly to be meant, that in order to cultivate an art, a man secludes\nhimself from the commerce of the world, and retires into the\ncountry at particular seasons; or that at one time of the year his\nbody is in better health, and consequently his mind fitter for the\nbusiness of hard thinking than at another time; or that the mind\nmay be fatigued and grow confused by long and unremitted\napplication; this I can understand.  I can likewise believe that a\nman eminent when young for possessing poetical imagination, may,\nfrom having taken another road, so neglect its cultivation as to\nshow less of its powers in his latter life.  But I am persuaded\nthat scarce a poet is to be found, from Homer down to Dryden, who\npreserved a sound mind in a sound body, and continued practising\nhis profession to the very last, whose later works are not as\nreplete with the fire of imagination as those which were produced\nin his more youthful days.",
        "To understand literally these metaphors or ideas expressed in\npoetical language, seems to be equally absurd as to conclude that\nbecause painters sometimes represent poets writing from the\ndictates of a little winged boy or genius, that this same genius\ndid really inform him in a whisper what he was to write, and that\nhe is himself but a mere machine, unconscious of the operations of\nhis own mind.",
        "Opinions generally received and floating in the world, whether true\nor false, we naturally adopt and make our own; they may be\nconsidered as a kind of inheritance to which we succeed and are\ntenants for life, and which we leave to our posterity very near in\nthe condition in which we received it; not much being in any one\nman’s power either to impair or improve it.",
        "The greatest part of these opinions, like current coin in its\ncirculation, we are obliged to take without weighing or examining;\nbut by this inevitable inattention, many adulterated pieces are\nreceived, which, when we seriously estimate our wealth, we must\nthrow away.  So the collector of popular opinions, when he embodies\nhis knowledge, and forms a system, must separate those which are\ntrue from those which are only plausible.  But it becomes more\npeculiarly a duty to the professors of art not to let any opinions\nrelating to that art pass unexamined.  The caution and\ncircumspection required in such examination we shall presently have\nan opportunity of explaining.",
        "Genius and taste, in their common acceptation, appear to be very\nnearly related; the difference lies only in this, that genius has\nsuperadded to it a habit or power of execution.  Or we may say,\nthat taste, when this power is added, changes its name, and is\ncalled genius.  They both, in the popular opinion, pretend to an\nentire exemption from the restraint of rules.  It is supposed that\ntheir powers are intuitive; that under the name of genius great\nworks are produced, and under the name of taste an exact judgment\nis given, without our knowing why, and without being under the\nleast obligation to reason, precept, or experience.",
        "One can scarce state these opinions without exposing their\nabsurdity, yet they are constantly in the mouths of men, and\nparticularly of artists.  They who have thought seriously on this\nsubject, do not carry the point so far; yet I am persuaded, that\neven among those few who may be called thinkers, the prevalent\nopinion gives less than it ought to the powers of reason; and\nconsiders the principles of taste, which give all their authority\nto the rules of art, as more fluctuating, and as having less solid\nfoundations than we shall find, upon examination, they really have.",
        "The common saying, that tastes are not to be disputed, owes its\ninfluence, and its general reception, to the same error which leads\nus to imagine it of too high original to submit to the authority of\nan earthly tribunal.  It will likewise correspond with the notions\nof those who consider it as a mere phantom of the imagination, so\ndevoid of substance as to elude all criticism.",
        "We often appear to differ in sentiments from each other, merely\nfrom the inaccuracy of terms, as we are not obliged to speak always\nwith critical exactness.  Something of this too may arise from want\nof words in the language to express the more nice discriminations\nwhich a deep investigation discovers.  A great deal, however, of\nthis difference vanishes when each opinion is tolerably explained\nand understood by constancy and precision in the use of terms.",
        "We apply the term taste to that act of the mind by which we like or\ndislike, whatever be the subject.  Our judgment upon an airy\nnothing, a fancy which has no foundation, is called by the same\nname which we give to our determination concerning those truths\nwhich refer to the most general and most unalterable principles of\nhuman nature, to works which are only to be produced by the\ngreatest efforts of the human understanding.  However inconvenient\nthis may be, we are obliged to take words as we find them; all we\ncan do is to distinguish the things to which they are applied.",
        "We may let pass those things which are at once subjects of taste\nand sense, and which having as much certainty as the senses\nthemselves, give no occasion to inquiry or dispute.  The natural\nappetite or taste of the human mind is for truth; whether that\ntruth results from the real agreement or equality of original ideas\namong themselves; from the agreement of the representation of any\nobject with the thing represented; or from the correspondence of\nthe several parts of any arrangement with each other.  It is the\nvery same taste which relishes a demonstration in geometry, that is\npleased with the resemblance of a picture to an original, and\ntouched with the harmony of music.",
        "All these have unalterable and fixed foundations in nature, and are\ntherefore equally investigated by reason, and known by study; some\nwith more, some with less clearness, but all exactly in the same\nway.  A picture that is unlike, is false.  Disproportionate\nordinance of parts is not right because it cannot be true until it\nceases to be a contradiction to assert that the parts have no\nrelation to the whole.  Colouring is true where it is naturally\nadapted to the eye, from brightness, from softness, from harmony,\nfrom resemblance; because these agree with their object, nature,\nand therefore are true:  as true as mathematical demonstration; but\nknown to be true only to those who study these things.",
        "But besides real, there is also apparent truth, or opinion, or\nprejudice.  With regard to real truth, when it is known, the taste\nwhich conforms to it is, and must be, uniform.  With regard to the\nsecond sort of truth, which may be called truth upon sufferance, or\ntruth by courtesy, it is not fixed, but variable.  However, whilst\nthese opinions and prejudices on which it is founded continue, they\noperate as truth; and the art, whose office it is to please the\nmind, as well as instruct it, must direct itself according to\nopinion, or it will not attain its end.",
        "In proportion as these prejudices are known to be generally\ndiffused, or long received, the taste which conforms to them\napproaches nearer to certainty, and to a sort of resemblance to\nreal science, even where opinions are found to be no better than\nprejudices.  And since they deserve, on account of their duration\nand extent, to be considered as really true, they become capable of\nno small decree of stability and determination by their permanent\nand uniform nature.",
        "As these prejudices become more narrow, more local, more\ntransitory, this secondary taste becomes more and more fantastical;\nrecedes from real science; is less to be approved by reason, and\nless followed in practice; though in no case perhaps to be wholly\nneglected, where it does not stand, as it sometimes does, in direct\ndefiance of the most respectable opinions received amongst mankind.",
        "Having laid down these positions, I shall proceed with less method,\nbecause less will serve, to explain and apply them.",
        "We will take it for granted that reason is something invariable and\nfixed in the nature of things; and without endeavouring to go back\nto an account of first principles, which for ever will elude our\nsearch, we will conclude that whatever goes under the name of\ntaste, which we can fairly bring under the dominion of reason, must\nbe considered as equally exempt from change.  If therefore, in the\ncourse of this inquiry, we can show that there are rules for the\nconduct of the artist which are fixed and invariable, it implies,\nof course, that the art of the connoisseur, or, in other words,\ntaste, has likewise invariable principles.",
        "Of the judgment which we make on the works of art, and the\npreference that we give to one class of art over another, if a\nreason be demanded, the question is perhaps evaded by answering, “I\njudge from my taste\"; but it does not follow that a better answer\ncannot be given, though for common gazers this may be sufficient.\nEvery man is not obliged to investigate the causes of his\napprobation or dislike.",
        "The arts would lie open for ever to caprice and casualty, if those\nwho are to judge of their excellences had no settled principles by\nwhich they are to regulate their decisions, and the merit or defect\nof performances were to be determined by unguided fancy.  And\nindeed we may venture to assert that whatever speculative knowledge\nis necessary to the artist, is equally and indispensably necessary\nto the connoisseur.",
        "The first idea that occurs in the consideration of what is fixed in\nart, or in taste, is that presiding principle of which I have so\nfrequently spoken in former discourses, the general idea of nature.\nThe beginning, the middle, and the end of everything that is\nvaluable in taste, is comprised in the knowledge of what is truly\nnature; for whatever ideas are not conformable to those of nature,\nor universal opinion, must be considered as more or less\ncapricious.",
        "The idea of nature comprehending not only the forms which nature\nproduces, but also the nature and internal fabric and organisation,\nas I may call it, of the human mind and imagination:  general\nideas, beauty, or nature, are but different ways of expressing the\nsame thing, whether we apply these terms to statues, poetry, or\npicture.  Deformity is not nature, but an accidental deviation from\nher accustomed practice.  This general idea therefore ought to be\ncalled nature, and nothing else, correctly speaking, has a right to\nthat name.  But we are so far from speaking, in common\nconversation, with any such accuracy, that, on the contrary, when\nwe criticise Rembrandt and other Dutch painters, who introduced\ninto their historical pictures exact representations of individual\nobjects with all their imperfections, we say, though it is not in a\ngood taste, yet it is nature.",
        "This misapplication of terms must be very often perplexing to the\nyoung student.  Is not, he may say, art an imitation of nature?\nMust he not, therefore, who imitates her with the greatest fidelity\nbe the best artist?  By this mode of reasoning Rembrandt has a\nhigher place than Raffaelle.  But a very little reflection will\nserve to show us that these particularities cannot be nature:  for\nhow can that be the nature of man, in which no two individuals are\nthe same?",
        "It plainly appears that as a work is conducted under the influence\nof general ideas or partial it is principally to be considered as\nthe effect of a good or a bad taste.",
        "As beauty therefore does not consist in taking what lies\nimmediately before you, so neither, in our pursuit of taste, are\nthose opinions which we first received and adopted the best choice,\nor the most natural to the mind and imagination.",
        "In the infancy of our knowledge we seize with greediness the good\nthat is within our reach; it is by after-consideration, and in\nconsequence of discipline, that we refuse the present for a greater\ngood at a distance.  The nobility or elevation of all arts, like\nthe excellence of virtue itself, consists in adopting this enlarged\nand comprehensive idea, and all criticism built upon the more\nconfined view of what is natural, may properly be called shallow\ncriticism, rather than false; its defect is that the truth is not\nsufficiently extensive.",
        "It has sometimes happened that some of the greatest men in our art\nhave been betrayed into errors by this confined mode of reasoning.\nPoussin, who, upon the whole, may be produced as an instance of\nattention to the most enlarged and extensive ideas of nature, from\nnot having settled principles on this point, has in one instance at\nleast, I think, deserted truth for prejudice.  He is said to have\nvindicated the conduct of Julio Romano, for his inattention to the\nmasses of light and shade, or grouping the figures, in the battle\nof Constantine, as if designedly neglected, the better to\ncorrespond with the hurry and confusion of a battle.  Poussin’s own\nconduct in his representations of Bacchanalian triumphs and\nsacrifices, makes us more easily give credit to this report, since\nin such subjects, as well indeed as in many others, it was too much\nhis own practice.  The best apology we can make for this conduct is\nwhat proceeds from the association of our ideas, the prejudice we\nhave in favour of antiquity.  Poussin’s works, as I have formerly\nobserved, have very much the air of the ancient manner of painting,\nin which there are not the least traces to make us think that what\nwe call the keeping, the composition of light and shade, or\ndistribution of the work into masses, claimed any part of their\nattention.  But surely whatever apology we may find out for this\nneglect, it ought to be ranked among the defects of Poussin, as\nwell as of the antique paintings; and the moderns have a right to\nthat praise which is their due, for having given so pleasing an\naddition to the splendour of the art.",
        "Perhaps no apology ought to be received for offences committed\nagainst the vehicle (whether it be the organ of seeing or of\nhearing) by which our pleasures are conveyed to the mind.  We must\ntake the same care that the eye be not perplexed and distracted by\na confusion of equal parts, or equal lights, as of offending it by\nan unharmonious mixture of colours.  We may venture to be more\nconfident of the truth of this observation, since we find that\nShakespeare, on a parallel occasion, has made Hamlet recommend to\nthe players a precept of the same kind, never to offend the ear by\nharsh sounds:- “In the very torrent, tempest, and whirlwind of your\npassions,” says he, “you must beget a temperance that may give it\nsmoothness.”  And yet, at the same time, he very justly observes,\n\"The end of playing, both at the first and now, is to hold, as it\nwere, the mirror up to nature.”  No one can deny but that violent\npassions will naturally emit harsh and disagreeable tones; yet this\ngreat poet and critic thought that this imitation of nature would\ncost too much, if purchased at the expense of disagreeable\nsensations, or, as he expresses it, of “splitting the ear.”  The\npoet and actor, as well as the painter of genius who is well\nacquainted with all the variety and sources of pleasure in the mind\nand imagination, has little regard or attention to common nature,\nor creeping after common sense.  By overleaping those narrow\nbounds, he more effectually seizes the whole mind, and more\npowerfully accomplishes his purpose.  This success is ignorantly\nimagined to proceed from inattention to all rules, and in defiance\nof reason and judgment; whereas it is in truth acting according to\nthe best rules, and the justest reason.",
        "He who thinks nature, in the narrow sense of the word, is alone to\nbe followed, will produce but a scanty entertainment for the\nimagination:  everything is to be done with which it is natural for\nthe mind to be pleased, whether it proceeds from simplicity or\nvariety, uniformity or irregularity:  whether the scenes are\nfamiliar or exotic; rude and wild, or enriched and cultivated; for\nit is natural for the mind to be pleased with all these in their\nturn.  In short, whatever pleases has in it what is analogous to\nthe mind, and is therefore, in the highest and best sense of the\nword, natural.",
        "It is this sense of nature or truth which ought more particularly\nto be cultivated by the professors of art; and it may be observed\nthat many wise and learned men, who have accustomed their minds to\nadmit nothing for truth but what can be proved by mathematical\ndemonstration, have seldom any relish for those arts which address\nthemselves to the fancy, the rectitude and truth of which is known\nby another kind of proof:  and we may add that the acquisition of\nthis knowledge requires as much circumspection and sagacity, as to\nattain those truths which are more open to demonstration.  Reason\nmust ultimately determine our choice on every occasion; but this\nreason may still be exerted ineffectually by applying to taste\nprinciples which, though right as far as they go, yet do not reach\nthe object.  No man, for instance, can deny that it seems at first\nview very reasonable, that a statue which is to carry down to\nposterity the resemblance of an individual should be dressed in the\nfashion of the times, in the dress which he himself wore:  this\nwould certainly be true if the dress were part of the man.  But\nafter a time the dress is only an amusement for an antiquarian; and\nif it obstructs the general design of the piece, it is to be\ndisregarded by the artist.  Common sense must here give way to a\nhigher sense.",
        "In the naked form, and in the disposition of the drapery, the\ndifference between one artist and another is principally seen.  But\nif he is compelled to the modern dress, the naked form is entirely\nhid, and the drapery is already disposed by the skill of the\ntailor.  Were a Phidias to obey such absurd commands, he would\nplease no more than an ordinary sculptor; since, in the inferior\nparts of every art, the learned and the ignorant are nearly upon a\nlevel.",
        "These were probably among the reasons that induced the sculptor of\nthat wonderful figure of Laocoon to exhibit him naked,\nnotwithstanding he was surprised in the act of sacrificing to\nApollo, and consequently ought to be shown in his sacerdotal\nhabits, if those greater reasons had not preponderated.  Art is not\nyet in so high estimation with us as to obtain so great a sacrifice\nas the ancients made, especially the Grecians, who suffered\nthemselves to be represented naked, whether they were generals,\nlawgivers, or kings.",
        "Under this head of balancing and choosing the greater reason, or of\ntwo evils taking the least, we may consider the conduct of Rubens\nin the Luxembourg gallery, of mixing allegorical figures with\nrepresentations of real personages, which, though acknowledged to\nbe a fault, yet, if the artist considered himself as engaged to\nfurnish this gallery with a rich and splendid ornament, this could\nnot be done, at least in an equal degree, without peopling the air\nand water with these allegorical figures:  he therefore\naccomplished that he purposes.  In this case all lesser\nconsiderations, which tend to obstruct the great end of the work,\nmust yield and give way.",
        "If it is objected that Rubens judged ill at first in thinking it\nnecessary to make his work so very ornamental, this brings the\nquestion upon new ground.  It was his peculiar style; he could\npaint in no other; and he was selected for that work, probably,\nbecause it was his style.  Nobody will dispute but some of the best\nof the Roman or Bolognian schools would have produced a more\nlearned and more noble work.",
        "This leads us to another important province of taste, of weighing\nthe value of the different classes of the art, and of estimating\nthem accordingly.",
        "All arts have means within them of applying themselves with success\nboth to the intellectual and sensitive part of our natures.  It can\nbe no dispute, supposing both these means put in practice with\nequal abilities, to which we ought to give the preference:  to him\nwho represents the heroic arts and more dignified passions of man,\nor to him who, by the help of meretricious ornaments, however\nelegant and graceful, captivates the sensuality, as it may be\ncalled, of our taste.  Thus the Roman and Bolognian schools are\nreasonably preferred to the Venetian, Flemish, or Dutch schools, as\nthey address themselves to our best and noblest faculties.",
        "Well-turned periods in eloquence, or harmony of numbers in poetry,\nwhich are in those arts what colouring is in painting, however\nhighly we may esteem them, can never be considered as of equal\nimportance with the art of unfolding truths that are useful to\nmankind, and which make us better or wiser.  Nor can those works\nwhich remind us of the poverty and meanness of our nature, be\nconsidered as of equal rank with what excites ideas of grandeur, or\nraises and dignifies humanity; or, in the words of a late poet,\nwhich makes the beholder learn to venerate himself as man.",
        "It is reason and good sense therefore which ranks and estimates\nevery art, and every part of that art, according to its importance,\nfrom the painter of animated down to inanimated nature.  We will\nnot allow a man, who shall prefer the inferior style, to say it is\nhis taste; taste here has nothing, or at least ought to have\nnothing to do with the question.  He wants not taste, but sense,\nand soundness of judgment.",
        "Indeed, perfection in an inferior style may be reasonably preferred\nto mediocrity in the highest walks of art.  A landscape of Claude\nLorraine may be preferred to a history of Luca Jordano; but hence\nappears the necessity of the connoisseur’s knowing in what consists\nthe excellence of each class, in order to judge how near it\napproaches to perfection.",
        "Even in works of the same kind, as in history painting, which is\ncomposed of various parts, excellence of an inferior species,\ncarried to a very high degree, will make a work very valuable, and\nin some measure compensate for the absence of the higher kind of\nmerits.  It is the duty of the connoisseur to know and esteem, as\nmuch as it may deserve, every part of painting; he will not then\nthink even Bassano unworthy of his notice, who, though totally\ndevoid of expression, sense, grace, or elegance, may be esteemed on\naccount of his admirable taste of colours, which, in his best\nworks, are little inferior to those of Titian.",
        "Since I have mentioned Bassano, we must do him likewise the justice\nto acknowledge that, though he did not aspire to the dignity of\nexpressing the characters and passions of men, yet, with respect to\nthe facility and truth in his manner of touching animals of all\nkinds, and giving them what painters call their character, few have\never excelled him.",
        "To Bassano we may add Paul Veronese and Tintoret, for their entire\ninattention to what is justly esteemed the most essential part of\nour art, the expression of the passions.  Notwithstanding these\nglaring deficiencies, we justly esteem their works; but it must be\nremembered that they do not please from those defects, but from\ntheir great excellences of another kind, and in spite of such\ntransgressions.  These excellences, too, as far as they go, are\nfounded in the truth of general nature.  They tell the truth,\nthough not the whole truth.",
        "By these considerations, which can never be too frequently\nimpressed, may be obviated two errors which I observed to have\nbeen, formerly at least, the most prevalent, and to be most\ninjurious to artists:  that of thinking taste and genius to have\nnothing to do with reason, and that of taking particular living\nobjects for nature.",
        "I shall now say something on that part of taste which, as I have\nhinted to you before, does not belong so much to the external form\nof things, but is addressed to the mind, and depends on its\noriginal frame, or, to use the expression, the organisation of the\nsoul; I mean the imagination and the passions.  The principles of\nthese are as invariable as the former, and are to be known and\nreasoned upon in the same manner, by an appeal to common sense\ndeciding upon the common feelings of mankind.  This sense, and\nthese feelings, appear to me of equal authority, and equally\nconclusive.",
        "Now this appeal implies a general uniformity and agreement in the\nminds of men.  It would be else an idle and vain endeavour to\nestablish rules of art; it would be pursuing a phantom to attempt\nto move affections with which we were entirely unacquainted.  We\nhave no reason to suspect there is a greater difference between our\nminds than between our forms, of which, though there are no two\nalike, yet there is a general similitude that goes through the\nwhole race of mankind; and those who have cultivated their taste\ncan distinguish what is beautiful or deformed, or, in other words,\nwhat agrees with or what deviates from the general idea of nature,\nin one case as well as in the other.",
        "The internal fabric of our mind, as well as the external form of\nour bodies, being nearly uniform, it seems then to follow, of\ncourse, that as the imagination is incapable of producing anything\noriginally of itself, and can only vary and combine these ideas\nwith which it is furnished by means of the senses, there will be,\nof course, an agreement in the imaginations as in the senses of\nmen.  There being this agreement, it follows that in all cases, in\nour lightest amusements as well as in our most serious actions and\nengagements of life, we must regulate our affections of every kind\nby that of others.  The well-disciplined mind acknowledges this\nauthority, and submits its own opinion to the public voice.",
        "It is from knowing what are the general feelings and passions of\nmankind that we acquire a true idea of what imagination is; though\nit appears as if we had nothing to do but to consult our own\nparticular sensations, and these were sufficient to ensure us from\nall error and mistake.",
        "A knowledge of the disposition and character of the human mind can\nbe acquired only by experience:  a great deal will be learned, I\nadmit, by a habit of examining what passes in our bosoms, what are\nour own motives of action, and of what kind of sentiments we are\nconscious on any occasion.  We may suppose a uniformity, and\nconclude that the same effect will be produced by the same cause in\nthe minds of others.  This examination will contribute to suggest\nto us matters of inquiry; but we can never be sure that our own\nsensations are true and right till they are confirmed by more\nextensive observation.",
        "One man opposing another determines nothing but a general union of\nminds, like a general combination of the forces of all mankind,\nmakes a strength that is irresistible.  In fact, as he who does not\nknow himself does not know others, so it may be said with equal\ntruth, that he who does not know others knows himself but very\nimperfectly.",
        "A man who thinks he is guarding himself against Prejudices by\nresisting the authority of others, leaves open every avenue to\nsingularity, vanity, self-conceit, obstinacy, and many other vices,\nall tending to warp the judgment and prevent the natural operation\nof his faculties.",
        "This submission to others is a deference which we owe, and indeed\nare forced involuntarily to pay.",
        "In fact we are never satisfied with our opinions till they are\nratified and confirmed by the suffrages of the rest of mankind.  We\ndispute and wrangle for ever; we endeavour to get men to come to us\nwhen we do not go to them.",
        "He therefore who is acquainted with the works which have pleased\ndifferent ages and different countries, and has formed his opinion\non them, has more materials and more means of knowing what is\nanalogous to the mind of man than he who is conversant only with\nthe works of his own age or country.  What has pleased, and\ncontinues to please, is likely to please again:  hence are derived\nthe rules of art, and on this immovable foundation they must ever\nstand.",
        "This search and study of the history of the mind ought not to be\nconfined to one art only.  It is by the analogy that one art bears\nto another that many things are ascertained which either were but\nfaintly seen, or, perhaps, would not have been discovered at all if\nthe inventor had not received the first hints from the practices of\na sister art on a similar occasion.  The frequent allusions which\nevery man who treats of any art is obliged to draw from others in\norder to illustrate and confirm his principles, sufficiently show\ntheir near connection and inseparable relation.",
        "All arts having the same general end, which is to please, and\naddressing themselves to the same faculties through the medium of\nthe senses, it follows that their rules and principles must have as\ngreat affinity as the different materials and the different organs\nor vehicles by which they pass to the mind will permit them to\nretain.",
        "We may therefore conclude that the real substance, as it may be\ncalled, of what goes under the name of taste, is fixed and\nestablished in the nature of things; that there are certain and\nregular causes by which the imagination and passions of men are\naffected; and that the knowledge of these causes is acquired by a\nlaborious and diligent investigation of nature, and by the same\nslow progress as wisdom or knowledge of every kind, however\ninstantaneous its operations may appear when thus acquired.",
        "It has been often observed that the good and virtuous man alone can\nacquire this true or just relish, even of works of art.  This\nopinion will not appear entirely without foundation when we\nconsider that the same habit of mind which is acquired by our\nsearch after truth in the more serious duties of life, is only\ntransferred to the pursuit of lighter amusements:  the same\ndisposition, the same desire to find something steady, substantial,\nand durable, on which the mind can lean, as it were, and rest with\nsafety.  The subject only is changed.  We pursue the same method in\nour search after the idea of beauty and perfection in each; of\nvirtue, by looking forwards beyond ourselves to society, and to the\nwhole; of arts, by extending our views in the same manner to all\nages and all times.",
        "Every art, like our own, has in its composition fluctuating as well\nas fixed principles.  It is an attentive inquiry into their\ndifference that will enable us to determine how far we are\ninfluenced by custom and habit, and what is fixed in the nature of\nthings.",
        "To distinguish how much has solid foundation, we may have recourse\nto the same proof by which some hold wit ought to be tried–whether\nit preserves itself when translated.  That wit is false which can\nsubsist only in one language; and that picture which pleases only\none age or one nation, owes its reception to some local or\naccidental association of ideas.",
        "We may apply this to every custom and habit of life.  Thus the\ngeneral principles of urbanity, politeness, or civility, have been\never the same in all nations; but the mode in which they are\ndressed is continually varying.  The general idea of showing\nrespect is by making yourself less:  but the manner, whether by\nbowing the body, kneeling, prostration, pulling off the upper part\nof our dress, or taking away the lower, is a matter of habit.  It\nwould be unjust to conclude that all ornaments, because they were\nat first arbitrarily contrived, are therefore undeserving of our\nattention; on the contrary, he who neglects the cultivation of\nthose ornaments, acts contrarily to nature and reason.  As life\nwould be imperfect without its highest ornaments, the arts, so\nthese arts themselves would be imperfect without THEIR ornaments.",
        "Though we by no means ought to rank these with positive and\nsubstantial beauties, yet it must be allowed that a knowledge of\nboth is essentially requisite towards forming a complete, whole,\nand perfect taste.  It is in reality from the ornaments that arts\nreceive their peculiar character and complexion; we may add that in\nthem we find the characteristical mark of a national taste, as by\nthrowing up a feather in the air we know which way the wind blows,\nbetter than by a more heavy matter.",
        "The striking distinction between the works of the Roman, Bolognian,\nand Venetian schools, consists more in that general effect which is\nproduced by colours than in the more profound excellences of the\nart; at least it is from thence that each is distinguished and\nknown at first sight.  As it is the ornaments rather than the\nproportions of architecture which at the first glance distinguish\nthe different orders from each other; the Doric is known by its\ntriglyphs, the Ionic by its volutes, and the Corinthian by its\nacanthus.",
        "What distinguishes oratory from a cold narration, is a more liberal\nthough chaste use of these ornaments which go under the name of\nfigurative and metaphorical expressions; and poetry distinguishes\nitself from oratory by words and expressions still more ardent and\nglowing.  What separates and distinguishes poetry is more\nparticularly the ornament of VERSE; it is this which gives it its\ncharacter, and is an essential, without which it cannot exist.\nCustom has appropriated different metre to different kinds of\ncomposition, in which the world is not perfectly agreed.  In\nEngland the dispute is not yet settled which is to be preferred,\nrhyme or blank verse.  But however we disagree about what these\nmetrical ornaments shall be, that some metre is essentially\nnecessary is universally acknowledged.",
        "In poetry or eloquence, to determine how far figurative or\nmetaphorical language may proceed, and when it begins to be\naffectation or beside the truth, must be determined by taste,\nthough this taste we must never forget is regulated and formed by\nthe presiding feelings of mankind, by those works which have\napproved themselves to all times and all persons.",
        "Thus, though eloquence has undoubtedly an essential and intrinsic\nexcellence, and immovable principles common to all languages,\nfounded in the nature of our passions and affections, yet it has\nits ornaments and modes of address which are merely arbitrary.\nWhat is approved in the Eastern nations as grand and majestic,\nwould be considered by the Greeks and Romans as turgid and\ninflated; and they, in return, would be thought by the Orientals to\nexpress themselves in a cold and insipid manner.",
        "We may add likewise to the credit of ornaments, that it is by their\nmeans that art itself accomplishes its purpose.  Fresnoy calls\ncolouring, which is one of the chief ornaments of painting, lena\nsororis, that which procures lovers and admirers to the more\nvaluable excellences of the art.",
        "It appears to be the same right turn of mind which enables a man to\nacquire the TRUTH, or the just idea of what is right in the\nornaments, as in the more stable principles of art.  It has still\nthe same centre of perfection, though it is the centre of a smaller\ncircle.",
        "To illustrate this by the fashion of dress, in which there is\nallowed to be a good or, bad taste.  The component parts of dress\nare continually changing from great to little, from short to long,\nbut the general form still remains; it is still the same general\ndress which is comparatively fixed, though on a very slender\nfoundation, but it is on this which fashion must rest.  He who\ninvents with the most success, or dresses in, the best taste, would\nprobably, from the same sagacity employed to greater purposes, have\ndiscovered equal skill, or have formed the same correct taste in\nthe highest labours of art.",
        "I have mentioned taste in dress, which is certainly one of the\nlowest subjects to which this word is applied; yet, as I have\nbefore observed, there is a right even here, however narrow its\nfoundation respecting the fashion of any particular nation.  But we\nhave still more slender means of determining, in regard to the\ndifferent customs of different ages or countries, to which to give\nthe preference, since they seem to be all equally removed from\nnature.",
        "If an European, when he has cut off his beard, and put false hair\non his head, or bound up his own natural hair in regular hard\nknots, as unlike nature as he can possibly make it; and having\nrendered them immovable by the help of the fat of hogs, has covered\nthe whole with flour, laid on by a machine with the utmost\nregularity; if, when thus attired he issues forth, he meets a\nCherokee Indian, who has bestowed as much time at his toilet, and\nlaid on with equal care and attention his yellow and red ochre on\nparticular parts of his forehead or cheeks, as he judges most\nbecoming; whoever despises the other for this attention to the\nfashion of his country, whichever of these two first feels himself\nprovoked to laugh, is the barbarian.",
        "All these fashions are very innocent, neither worth disquisition,\nnor any endeavour to alter them, as the change would, in all\nprobability, be equally distant from nature.  The only\ncircumstances against which indignation may reasonably be moved,\nare where the operation is painful or destructive of health, such\nas is practised at Otahaiti, and the straight lacing of the English\nladies; of the last of which, how destructive it must be to health\nand long life, the professor of anatomy took an opportunity of\nproving a few days since in this Academy.",
        "It is in dress as in things of greater consequence.  Fashions\noriginate from those only who have the high and powerful advantages\nof rank, birth, and fortune; as many of the ornaments of art, those\nat least for which no reason can be given, are transmitted to us,\nare adopted, and acquire their consequence from the company in\nwhich we have been used to see them.  As Greece and Rome are the\nfountains from whence have flowed all kinds of excellence, to that\nveneration which they have a right to claim for the pleasure and\nknowledge which they have afforded us, we voluntarily add our\napprobation of every ornament and every custom that belonged to\nthem, even to the fashion of their dress.  For it may be observed\nthat, not satisfied with them in their own place, we make no\ndifficulty of dressing statues of modern heroes or senators in the\nfashion of the Roman armour or peaceful robe; we go so far as\nhardly to bear a statue in any other drapery.",
        "The figures of the great men of those nations have come down to us\nin sculpture.  In sculpture remain almost all the excellent\nspecimens of ancient art.  We have so far associated personal\ndignity to the persons thus represented, and the truth of art to\ntheir manner of representation, that it is not in our power any\nlonger to separate them.  This is not so in painting; because,\nhaving no excellent ancient portraits, that connection was never\nformed.  Indeed, we could no more venture to paint a general\nofficer in a Roman military habit, than we could make a statue in\nthe present uniform.  But since we have no ancient portraits, to\nshow how ready we are to adopt those kind of prejudices, we make\nthe best authority among the moderns serve the same purpose.  The\ngreat variety of excellent portraits with which Vandyke has\nenriched this nation, we are not content to admire for their real\nexcellence, but extend our approbation even to the dress which\nhappened to be the fashion of that age.  We all very well remember\nhow common it was a few years ago for portraits to be drawn in this\nGothic dress, and this custom is not yet entirely laid aside.  By\nthis means it must be acknowledged very ordinary pictures acquired\nsomething of the air and effect of the works of Vandyke, and\nappeared therefore at first sight to be better pictures than they\nreally were; they appeared so, however, to those only who had the\nmeans of making this association, for when made, it was\nirresistible.  But this association is nature, and refers to that\nSecondary truth that comes from conformity to general prejudice and\nopinion; it is therefore not merely fantastical.  Besides the\nprejudice which we have in favour of ancient dresses, there may be\nlikewise other reasons, amongst which we may justly rank the\nsimplicity of them, consisting of little more than one single piece\nof drapery, without those whimsical capricious forms by which all\nother dresses are embarrassed.",
        "Thus, though it is from the prejudice we have in favour of the\nancients, who have taught us architecture, that we have adopted\nlikewise their ornaments; and though we are satisfied that neither\nnature nor reason is the foundation of those beauties which we\nimagine we see in that art, yet if any one persuaded of this truth\nshould, therefore, invent new orders of equal beauty, which we will\nsuppose to be possible, yet they would not please, nor ought he to\ncomplain, since the old has that great advantage of having custom\nand prejudice on its side.  In this case we leave what has every\nprejudice in its favour to take that which will have no advantage\nover what we have left, but novelty, which soon destroys itself,\nand, at any rate, is but a weak antagonist against custom.",
        "These ornaments, having the right of possession, ought not to be\nremoved but to make room for not only what has higher pretensions,\nbut such pretensions as will balance the evil and confusion which\ninnovation always brings with it.",
        "To this we may add, even the durability of the materials will often\ncontribute to give a superiority to one object over another.\nOrnaments in buildings, with which taste is principally concerned,\nare composed of materials which last longer than those of which\ndress is composed; it, therefore, makes higher pretensions to our\nfavour and prejudice.",
        "Some attention is surely required to what we can no more get rid of\nthan we can go out of ourselves.  We are creatures of prejudice; we\nneither can nor ought to eradicate it; we must only regulate, it by\nreason, which regulation by reason is, indeed, little more than\nobliging the lesser, the focal and temporary prejudices, to give\nway to those which are more durable and lasting.",
        "He, therefore, who in his practice of portrait painting wishes to\ndignify his subject, which we will suppose to be a lady, will not\npaint her in the modern dress, the familiarity of which alone is\nsufficient to destroy all dignity.  He takes care that his work\nshall correspond to those ideas and that imagination which he knows\nwill regulate the judgment of others, and, therefore, dresses his\nfigure something with the general air of the antique for the sake\nof dignity, and preserves something of the modern for the sake of\nlikeness.  By this conduct his works correspond with those\nprejudices which we have in favour of what we continually see; and\nthe relish of the antique simplicity corresponds with what we may\ncall the, more learned and scientific prejudice.",
        "There was a statue made not long since of Voltaire, which the\nsculptor, not having that respect for the prejudices of mankind\nwhich he ought to have, has made entirely naked, and as meagre and\nemaciated as the original is said to be.  The consequence is what\nmight be expected; it has remained in the sculptor’s shop, though\nit was intended as a public ornament and a public honour to\nVoltaire, as it was procured at the expense of his cotemporary wits\nand admirers.",
        "Whoever would reform a nation, supposing a bad taste to prevail in\nit, will not accomplish his purpose by going directly against the\nstream of their prejudices.  Men’s minds must be prepared to\nreceive what is new to them.  Reformation is a work of time.  A\nnational taste, however wrong it may be, cannot be totally change\nat once; we must yield a little to the prepossession which has\ntaken hold on the mind, and we may then bring people to adopt what\nwould offend them if endeavoured to be introduced by storm.  When\nBattisto Franco was employed, in conjunction with Titian, Paul\nVeronese, and Tintoret, to adorn the library of St. Mark, his work,\nVasari says, gave less satisfaction than any of the others:  the\ndry manner of the Roman school was very ill calculated to please\neyes that had been accustomed to the luxuriance, splendour, and\nrichness of Venetian colouring.  Had the Romans been the judges of\nthis work, probably the determination would have been just\ncontrary; for in the more noble parts of the art Battisto Franco\nwas, perhaps, not inferior to any of his rivals.",
        "Gentlemen,–It has been the main scope and principal end of this\ndiscourse to demonstrate the reality of a standard in taste, as\nwell as in corporeal beauty; that a false or depraved taste is a\nthing as well known, as easily discovered, as anything that is\ndeformed, misshapen, or wrong in our form or outward make; and that\nthis knowledge is derived from the uniformity of sentiments among\nmankind, from whence proceeds the knowledge of what are the general\nhabits of nature, the result of which is an idea of perfect beauty.",
        "If what has been advanced be true, that besides this beauty or\ntruth which is formed on the uniform eternal and immutable laws of\nnature, and which of necessity can be but one; that besides this\none immutable verity there are likewise what we have called\napparent or secondary truths proceeding from local and temporary\nprejudices, fancies, fashions, or accidental connection of ideas;\nif it appears that these last have still their foundation, however\nslender, in the original fabric of our minds, it follows that all\nthese truths or beauties deserve and require the attention of the\nartist in proportion to their stability or duration, or as their\ninfluence is more or less extensive.  And let me add that as they\nought not to pass their just bounds, so neither do they, in a well-\nregulated taste, at all prevent or weaken the influence of these\ngeneral principles, which alone can give to art its true and\npermanent dignity.",
        "To form this just taste is undoubtedly in your own power, but it is\nto reason and philosophy that you must have recourse; from them we\nmust borrow the balance by which is to be weighed and estimated the\nvalue of every pretension that intrudes itself on your notice.",
        "The general objection which is made to the introduction of\nphilosophy into the regions of taste is, that it checks and\nrestrains the flights of the imagination, and gives that timidity\nwhich an over-carefulness not to err or act contrary to reason is\nlikely to produce.",
        "It is not so.  Fear is neither reason nor philosophy.  The true\nspirit of philosophy by giving knowledge gives a manly confidence,\nand substitutes rational firmness in the place of vain presumption.\nA man of real taste is always a man of judgment in other respects;\nand those inventions which either disdain or shrink from reason,\nare generally, I fear, more like the dreams of a distempered brain\nthan the exalted enthusiasm of a sound and true genius.  In the\nmidst of the highest flights of fancy or imagination, reason ought\nto preside from first to last, though I admit her more powerful\noperation is upon reflection.",
        "I cannot help adding that some of the greatest names of antiquity,\nand those who have most distinguished themselves in works of genius\nand imagination, were equally eminent for their critical skill.\nPlato, Aristotle, Cicero, and Horace; and among the moderns,\nBoileau, Corneille, Pope, and Dryden, are at least instances of\ngenius not being destroyed by attention or subjection to rules and\nscience.  I should hope, therefore, that the natural consequence\nlikewise of what has been said would be to excite in you a desire\nof knowing the principles and conduct of the great masters of our\nart, and respect and veneration for them when known.",
