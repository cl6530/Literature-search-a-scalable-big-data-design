        "But I and my companions were not to be kept long in our distress,\ngrieving over the bad faith of the Spaniards, for in the month of\nMarch of the year referred to (1898) some people came to me and in the\nname of the Commander of the U.S.S. Petrel asked for a conference\nin compliance with the wishes of Admiral Dewey.",
        "I had some interviews with the above-mentioned Commander, i.e.,\nduring the evening of the 16th March and 6th April, during which the\nCommander urged me to return to the Philippines to renew hostilities\nagainst the Spaniards with the object of gaining our independence,\nand he assured me of the assistance of the United States in the event\nof war between the United States and Spain.",
        "I then asked the Commander of the Petrel what the United States\ncould concede to the Filipinos. In reply he said: ’The United States\nis a great and rich nation and needs no colonies.”",
        "In view of this reply I suggested to the Commander the advisability\nof stating in writing what would be agreed to by the United States,\nand be replied that he would refer the matter to Admiral Dewey.",
        "In the midst of my negotiations with the Commander of the Petrel I\nwas interrupted by letters from Isabelo Artacho and his solicitors, on\nthe 5th April, claiming $200,000 of the money received from the Spanish\nauthorities, and asserting that he (Artacho) should receive this\nsum as salary due to him while acting as Secretary of the Interior,\nhe having been, it was alleged, a member of the Filipino Government\nestablished in Biak-na-bató. These letters contained the threat\nthat failure to comply with the demand of Artacho would result in\nhim bringing me before the Courts of Law in Hongkong. It may make the\nmatter clearer if I mention at this point that Isabelo Artacho arrived\nat Biak-na-bató and made himself known to and mixed with the officers\nin the revolutionary camp on the 21st day of September, 1897, and was\nappointed Secretary of the Interior in the early part of November of\nthat year, when the Treaty of Peace proposed and negotiated by Don\nPedro Alejandro Paterno was almost concluded, as is proved by the\nfact that the document was signed on the 14th of December of that year.",
        "In the light of these facts the unjust and unreasonable nature of\nthe claim of Artacho is easily discernable, for it is monstrous to\nclaim $200,000 for services rendered to the Revolutionary Government\nduring such a brief period.",
        "Moreover, it is a fact that it was agreed between ourselves (the\nleaders of the Revolution assembled in Biak-na-bató) that in the\nevent of the Spaniards failing to comply with each and every one of\nthe terms and conditions of the Agreement the money obtained from\nthe Spanish Government should not be divided, but must be employed in\nthe purchase of arms and ammunition to renew the war of independence.",
        "It is therefore evident that Artacho, in making this preposterous\ndemand, was acting as a spy for the enemy, as an agent of General Primo\nde Rivera, for he wanted to extinguish the rebellion by depriving its\norganizers and leaders of the most indispensable element, the “sinews\nof war,” which is money. This was the view, too, of the whole of my\ncolleagues, and it was resolved by us that I should leave Hongkong\nimmediately and thereby avoid the litigation which Artacho seemed\nbent upon and thereby afford my companions time and opportunity to\nremove this new and wholly unexpected barrier to the realization of\nour cherished plans for the emancipation of our beloved fatherland. I\nam profoundly pleased to say that they succeeded, Artacho withdrawing\nthe suit through a transaction.",
        "In accordance with the decision of the meeting above referred to, I\nleft Hongkong quietly on the 7th April, 1898, on board the steamship\nTaisany, and after calling at Saigon I reached Singapore as a\npassenger by the s.s. Eridan, landing there as secretly as possible\non the 21st April. I at once proceeded to the residence of one of\nmy countrymen.",
        "Thus is explained the cause of the interruption of the vitally\nimportant negotiations with Admiral Dewey, initiated by the Commander\nof the Petrel.",
        "But “Man proposes and God disposes” is a proverb which was verified\nin its fullest sense on this occasion, for, notwithstanding the\nprecautions taken in my journey to avoid identification yet at\n4 o’clock in the afternoon of the day I arrived at Singapore an\nEnglishman came to the house in which I was residing and in a cautious\nmanner stated that the United States Consul at that port, Mr. Spencer\nPratt, wished to have an interview with Don Emilio Aguinaldo. The\nvisitor was told that in that house they did not know Aguinaldo;\nthis being the prearranged answer for any callers.",
        "But the Englishman returned to the house several times and persisted\nin saying that it was no use trying to conceal the fact of Aguinaldo’s\narrival for Consul Pratt had received notice from Admiral Dewey of\nGeneral Aguinaldo’s journey to Singapore.",
        "In reply, the Consul said he would telegraph about this matter to\nAdmiral Dewey, who was, he said, Commander-in-Chief of the squadron\nwhich would invade the Philippines, and who had, he also stated,\nfull powers conferred on him by President McKinley.",
        "Between 10 or 12 in the forenoon of the next day the conference was\nrenewed and Mr. Pratt then informed me that the Admiral had sent him\na telegram in reply to the wish I had expressed for an agreement in\nwriting. He said the Admiral’s reply was–That the United States\nwould at least recognize the Independence of the Philippines under\nthe protection of the United States Navy. The Consul added that there\nwas no necessity for entering into a formal written agreement because\nthe word of the Admiral and of the United States Consul were in fact\nequivalent to the most solemn pledge that their verbal promises and\nassurance would be fulfilled to the letter and were not to be classed\nwith Spanish promises or Spanish ideas of a man’s word of honour. In\nconclusion the Consul said, “The Government of North America, is a\nvery honest, just, and powerful government._”",
        "Being informed of what had been said by the visitor I consented to\nmeet Consul Pratt, and had a strictly private interview with him\nbetween 9 and 12 p.m. on 22nd April, 1898, in one of the suburbs\nof Singapore. As soon as Mr. Pratt met me he said that war had been\nformally declared by the United States against Spain the day before,\ni.e., on the 21st April.",
        "In the course of the interview alluded to, Consul Pratt told me that as\nthe Spaniards had not fulfilled the promises made in the Biak-na-bató\nAgreement, the Filipinos had the right to continue the revolution\nwhich had been checked by the Biak-na-bató arrangement, and after\nurging me to resume hostilities against the Spaniards he assured\nme that the United States would grant much greater liberty and more\nmaterial benefits to the Filipinos than the Spaniards ever promised.",
        "I then asked the Consul what benefits the United States would confer\non the Philippines, pointing out at the same time the advisability\nof making an agreement and setting out all the terms and conditions\nin black and white.",
        "Being as anxious to be in the Philippines as Admiral Dewey and the\nNorth American Consul–to renew the struggle for our Independence–I\ntook the opportunity afforded me by these representatives of the United\nStates, and, placing the fullest confidence in their word of honour,\nI said to Mr. Pratt (in response to his persistent professions of\nsolicitude for the welfare of my countrymen) that he could count upon\nme when I returned to the Philippines to raise the people as one man\nagainst the Spaniards, with the one grand object in view as above\nmentioned, if I could take firearms with me to distribute amongst my\ncountrymen. I assured him that I would put forth my utmost endeavours\nto crush and extinguish the power of Spain in the islands and I added\nthat if in possession of one battery of a dozen field-guns I would\nmake the Spaniards surrender Manila in about two weeks.",
        "The Consul said he would help me to get over to the Philippines the\nconsignment of arms in respect of which I had made the preliminary\narrangements in Hongkong, and he added that he would at once telegraph\nto Admiral Dewey informing him of this promise in order that the\nAdmiral might give what assistance laid in his power to make the\nexpedition in question a success.",
        "On the 25th April the last conference was held in the United States\nConsulate at Singapore. I was invited by the Consul to meet him on\nthis occasion and as soon as we met he said he had received a telegram\nfrom the Admiral requesting him to ask me to proceed to Hongkong by\nfirst steamer to join the Admiral who was then with his squadron in\nMir’s Bay; a Chinese harbour close to Hongkong. I replied to this\nproposal in the affirmative, and gave directions to my aide-de-campto at once procure passages for myself and companions, care being\ntaken that the tickets should bear the assumed names we had adopted\non the occasion of our journey from Hongkong to Singapore, it being\nadvisable that we should continue to travel incognito.",
        "On the 26th April I called on Consul Pratt to bid him adieu on the eve\nof my departure from Singapore by the steamship Malacca. The Consul,\nafter telling me that when I got near the port of Hongkong I would\nbe met by the Admiral’s launch and taken from the Malacca to the\nAmerican squadron (a precaution against news of my movements becoming\npublic property, of which I highly approved), then asked me to appoint\nhim Representative of the Philippines in the United States, there to\nzealously advocate official recognition of our Independence. My answer\nwas, that I would propose him for the position of Representative of\nthe Philippines in the United States when the Philippine Government\nwas properly organized, though I thought it an insignificant reward\nfor his assistance, for, in the event of our Independence becoming\nun fait accompli I intended to offer him a high position in the\nCustoms Department, besides granting certain commercial advantages\nand contributing towards the cost of the war whatever sum he might\nconsider due to his Government; because the Filipinos had already\ndecided such a policy was the natural outcome of the exigencies of\nthe situation and could be construed only as a right and proper token\nof the nation’s gratitude.",
        "But to continue the statement of facts respecting my return to Hongkong\nfrom Singapore: I left Singapore with my A.D. Cs., Sres Pilar and\nLeyba, bound for Hongkong by the s.s. Malacca, arriving at Hongkong\nat 2 a.m. on the 1st May, without seeing or hearing anything of the\nlaunch which I had been led by Consul Pratt to expect to meet me near\nthe entrance of Hongkong harbour. In response to an invitation from\nMr. Rounsevelle Wildman, United States Consul at Hongkong, I wended\nmy way to the United States Consulate and between 9 and 11 p.m. of the\nsame day I had an interview with him. Mr. Wildman told me that Admiral\nDewey left for Manila hurriedly in accordance with imperative orders\nfrom his Government directing him to attack the Spanish Fleet. He\nwas therefore unable to await my arrival before weighing anchor and\ngoing forth to give battle to the Spaniards. Mr. Wildman added that\nAdmiral Dewey left word with him that he would send a gunboat to\ntake me across to the Philippines. In the course of this interview\nwith Mr. Wildman I spoke to him about the shipment of arms to the\nislands which I had previously planned with him, and it was then\nagreed among ourselves that he (Mr. Rounsevelle Wildman) and the\nFilipino Mr. Teodoro Sandico should complete the arrangements for\nthe despatch of the expedition, and I there and then handed to and\ndeposited with them the sum of $50,000.",
        "A steam launch was quickly purchased for $15,000, while a contract\nwas made and entered into for the purchase of 2,000 rifles at $7 each\nand 200,000 rounds of ammunition at $33 and 56/100 per 1000.",
        "A week later (7th May) the American despatch-boat McCulloch arrived\nfrom Manila bringing news of Admiral Dewey’s victory over the Spanish\nfleet, but did not bring orders to convey me to Manila. At 9 o’clock\nthat night I had another interview with Consul Wildman, at his request.",
        "On the 15th of the same month the McCulloch again arrived at\nHongkong from Manila, this time bringing orders to convey me and my\ncompanions to Manila. I was promptly notified of this by Consul Wildman\nwho requested that we go on board the McCulloch at 10 o’clock at\nnight on 16th May. Accompanied by Consul Wildman, the Captain of the\nMcCulloch, and Mr. John Barrett (who then usually styled himself\n“ex-Secretary of the United States Legation in Siam”) we boarded an\nAmerican steam launch and proceeded to Chinese Kowloon Bay, where the\nMcCulloch was anchored. While bidding us adieu Mr. Barrett said he\nwould call on me in the Philippines, which he did later on in Cavite\nand Malolos.",
        "Mr. Wildman strongly advised me to establish a Dictatorship as soon\nas I arrived in the Philippines, and he assured me that he would use\nhis best endeavours to have the arms already contracted for delivered\nto me in the Philippines, which he in fact did. [It is to be observed,\nthough, that the first expedition having been conducted satisfactorily,\nthe arms reaching me in due course, I was naturally grateful and\nhad confidence in the sincerity and good faith of Consul Wildman,\nand there was nothing surprising therefore in the fact that I asked\nhim to fit out another expedition and caused the sum of $67,000 to\nbe deposited with him for that purpose. I regret to state, however,\nthat Mr. Wildman has failed to comply with my request and I am informed\nthat he refuses to refund the money.]",
        "The McCulloch left Hongkong at 11 a.m. on the 17th May and arrived\noff Cavite (Manila Bay) between noon and 1 p.m. on the 19th idem. No\nsooner had the McCulloch dropped anchor than the Admiral’s launch,\ncarrying his Adjutant and Private Secretary, came alongside to convey\nme the flagship Olympia, where I was received with my Adjutant\n(Sr. Leyba) with the honours due to a General.",
        "The Admiral ushered me into his private quarters, and after the\nexchange of the usual greetings I asked whether it was true that\nhe had sent all the telegrams to the Consul at Singapore, Mr. Pratt,\nwhich that gentleman had told me he received in regard to myself. The\nAdmiral replied in the affirmative, adding that the United States had\ncome to the Philippines to protect the natives and free them from\nthe yoke of Spain. He said, moreover, that America is exceedingly\nwell off as regards territory, revenue, and resources and therefore\nneeds no colonies, assuring me finally that there was no occasion\nfor me to entertain any doubts whatever about the recognition of the\nIndependence of the Philippines by the United States. Then Admiral\nDewey asked me if I could induce the people to rise against the\nSpaniards and make a short, sharp, and decisive campaign of it.",
        "I said in reply that events would speak for themselves, but while\na certain arms expedition (respecting which Consul Wildman was duly\ninformed that it would be despatched from a Chinese port) was delayed\nin China we could do nothing, because without arms every victory\nwould assuredly cost us the lives of many brave and dashing Filipino\nwarriors. The Admiral thereupon offered to despatch a steamer to hurry\nup the expedition. (This, be it borne in mind, in addition to the\nGeneral orders he had given the Consul to assist us to procure arms\nand ammunition.) Then he at once placed at my disposal all the guns\nseized onboard the Spanish warships as well as 62 Mausers and a good\nmany rounds of ammunition which had been brought up from Corregidor\nIsland by the U.S.S. Petrel.",
        "I then availed myself of an early opportunity to express to the\nAdmiral my deep gratitude for the assistance rendered to the people\nof the Philippines by the United States, as well as my unbounded\nadmiration of the grandeur and beneficence of the American people. I\nalso candidly informed the Admiral that before I left Hongkong the\nFilipinos residing in that colony hold a meeting at which the following\nquestion was fully discussed, namely, the possibility that after the\nSpaniards were defeated, and their power and prestige in the islands\ndestroyed, the Filipinos might have to wage war against the United\nStates owing to the American Government declining to recognize our\nindependence. In that event the Americans, it was generally agreed,\nwould be sure to defeat us for they would find us worn out and short\nof ammunition owing to our struggle with the Spaniards. I concluded\nby asking the gallant Admiral to excuse me for an amount of frankness\nthat night appear to border on impudence, and assured him of the\nfact that I was actuated only by a desire to have a perfectly clear\nunderstanding in the interest of both parties.\nThe Admiral said he was very glad to have this evidence of our\nearnestness and straightforwardness and he thought the Filipinos and\nAmericans should act towards one another as friends and allies, and\ntherefore it was right and proper that all doubts should be expressed\nfrankly in order that explanations be made, difficulties avoided,\nand distrust removed; adding that, as he had already indicated, the\nUnited States would unquestionably recognize the Independence of the\npeople of the Philippines, guaranteed as it was by the word of honour\nof Americans, which, he said, is more positive, more irrevocable than\nany written agreement, which might not be regarded as binding when\nthere is an intention or desire to repudiate it, as was the case in\nrespect of the compact made with the Spaniards at Biak-na-bató. Then\nthe Admiral advised me to at once have made a Filipino National\nFlag, which he said he would recognize and protect in the presence\nof the other nations represented by the various squadrons anchored\nin Manila Bay, adding, however, that he thought it advisable that we\nshould destroy the power of Spain before hoisting our national flag,\nin order that the act would appear more important and creditable in\nthe eyes of the world and of the United States in particular. Then\nwhen the Filipino vessels passed to and fro with the national flag\nfluttering in the breeze they would attract more attention and be\nmore likely to induce respect for the national colours.",
        "I again thanked the Admiral for his good advice and generous offers,\ngiving him to understand clearly that I was willing to sacrifice my\nown life if he would be thereby more exalted in the estimation of\nthe United States, more honoured by his fellow-countrymen.",
        "I added that under the present conditions of hearty co-operation,\ngood fellowship and a clear understanding the whole nation would\nrespond to the call to arms to shake off the yoke of Spain and obtain\ntheir freedom by destroying the power of Spain in all parts of the\narchipelago. If, however, all did not at once join in the movement\nthat should not cause surprise, for there would be many unable to\nassist owing to lack of arms and ammunition, while others, again,\nmight be reluctant to take an active part in the campaign on account\nof the loss and inconvenience to themselves and families that would\nresult, from open hostility to the Spaniards.",
        "Thus ended my first interview with Admiral Dewey, to whom I signified\nmy intention to reside for a while at the headquarters of the Naval\nCommandant of Cavite Arsenal.",
