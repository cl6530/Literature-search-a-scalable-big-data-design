        "For full seven years had Charlemagne tarried in Spain, and all the land\nlay conquered save the city of Saragossa. There, in an orchard, upon a\nterrace paved with blue marble, sat its king, Marsile, taking counsel with\nhis lords.",
        "“No army have I,” said the king; “no people to array against the hosts of\nthe great emperor. Advise me, my lords, what I shall do to save ourselves\nfrom disgrace and shame.”",
        "The wily Blancandrin, wisest and greatest among the pagans, advanced\nbefore him. “Where might cannot prevail, often craft gains the day. My\nlord, send gifts to mighty Carle. Drive forth a long train of camels; heap\nmany mules with gold; send chariots filled with precious gifts. Advise him\nthat on the day of Saint Michael’s feast you will seek him at Aix, and\nthere become a Christian, and his vassal. Yea, even send hostages; my own\nson shall go, even though he lose his head. Then will Carle depart for\nFrance. The day set by you will come, but he will hear naught from us. The\nhostages’ heads will fall. What of it? Better this than for us to lose\nforever Spain the fair.”",
        "The king, pleased with the craft of Blancandrin, dismissed his council,\nand ordered ten of his fiercest barons to seek Charlemagne at Cordova,\nbearing the olive-branch, and make the offer suggested by Blancandrin.",
        "Cordova, filled with rich spoils, had been taken, and its surviving\ninhabitants given the choice of the sword or Christian baptism. Therefore\nthe happy emperor sat at his ease in a wide-spreading orchard. Around him\nstood Roland, Olivier, Samsun the duke, Anseis, Gefrei d’Anjou, and\nGerier. At least fifteen thousand French knights were diverting themselves\nwith different games in the beautiful orchard, where, under a pine-tree,\nthe great King of France sat upon a golden chair. His white hair and\nflowing white beard added majesty to his already majestic figure, so that\nthe olive-bearing messengers needed not to have great Carle pointed out to\nthem.",
        "The emperor heard the message of Marsile in silence, and dismissing the\npagans for the night to a pavilion, called together in council his wisest\nbarons, Duke Ogier, Archbishop Turpin, Gerier, Roland, Olivier, a thousand\nFranks, among them Ganelon, the step-father of Roland, and laid before\nthem the message of Marsile.",
        "“Rich gifts he offers me, but he demands that I return to France; thither\nwill he follow me, and at Aix will become a Christian and a vassal. A fair\npromise, but what is in his heart I cannot tell.”",
        "After a moment’s silence Roland stood forth.",
        "“Sire, have no faith in the words of Marsile. When have we found aught but\ntreachery in the Saracen? For seven years I have been winning victories\nfor you here in Spain. Once before you yielded to such a message as this,\nfrom this same Marsile, and lost, in consequence, the heads of your Counts\nBazan and Bazile. War on as you have begun. Besiege his city! subdue\nSaragossa!”",
        "Then strode forth the angry Ganelon. “My king, this young hot-head is a\nfool; hearken not unto him. Accept the offer of Marsile, and lose no more\nlives by the foolhardiness of one who cares more for his own glory than\nfor human life.”",
        "The voice of the others, among them Duke Naimes, Charlemagne’s wisest\ncounsellor and truest vassal, was with Ganelon. The emperor stroked his\nwhite beard. “My lords, whom shall we send to meet Marsile at Saragossa?”",
        "“I will go,” said Duke Naimes.",
        "“Nay, I cannot spare you from my councils,” replied the king.",
        "“I am here!” cried Roland.",
        "“Not you! You are too hot-headed to venture into the court of the enemy!\"\ncried his friend Olivier. “Let me go instead, sire!”",
        "“Nay!” cried the king. “Silence! Not one of the twelve peers sets his foot\nin the kingdom of the Moors.”",
        "“Then let my step-father go,” suggested Roland. “No wiser man than he can\nbe found.”",
        "“Come forward,” said the king, as the Franks murmured assent, “and receive\nthe staff and glove. The Franks have chosen you.”",
        "Ganelon rose, wrathful, casting off his fur robe. His eyes were gray, his\nface fierce, his form noble.",
        "“This is Roland’s work. I shall hate him forever, and Olivier, and the\ntwelve peers, because they love him. Ne’er shall I return; full well I\nknow it. If e’er I do, it will be to wreak vengeance on my enemy.”",
        "“Go!” said the king. “You have said enough!”",
        "As Ganelon went forward, full of rage, to receive the king’s glove, it\nfell ere he touched it. “A bad omen!” exclaimed the French.",
        "“Sirs, ye shall hear of this!” said Ganelon.",
        "On his way to Saragossa with the legates of Marsile, Ganelon laid the\nimpious plot that was to result in the destruction of Roland and the\npeers. It saved his life at Saragossa, where Marsile threatened to kill\nhim on reading Charlemagne’s message. He explained carefully to the\nSaracens how the rear guard, left at Roncesvalles under the command of\nRoland and the twelve peers, could be destroyed by the pagan forces before\nthe knowledge of the battle could reach Charlemagne, and that, with these\nprops of his kingdom gone, the king’s power would be so diminished that\nMarsile could easily hold out against him. Then the traitor hastened back\nto Cordova, laden with rich gifts.",
        "When Ganelon rode back, the emperor was preparing to return to sweet\nFrance. “Barons,” said Carle, “whom shall I leave in charge of these deep\ndefiles and narrow passes?”",
        "“My step-son Roland is well able to take the command,” said Ganelon; “he\nyour nephew, whom you prize most of all your knights.”",
        "Rage filled the hearts of both Roland and Carle; but the word was spoken,\nand Roland must remain. With him remained the twelve peers, his friends,\nOlivier, his devoted comrade, the gallant Archbishop Turpin, and twenty\nthousand valiant knights.",
        "While Charlemagne’s army toiled over the terrible gorges and high\nmountains into Gascony, the emperor, ever grieving over the untimely death\nhis nephew might meet in the defiles of Spain, down came the pagans, who\nhad been gathering on the high mountains and in the murky valleys,–emirs,\nsons of noble counts were they, brave as the followers of Charlemagne.",
        "When Olivier descried the pagan horde he at once exclaimed,–",
        "“This is the work of Ganelon!”",
        "“Hush!” replied Roland. “He is my step-father. Say no more.”",
        "Then Olivier, when from the hill he saw the one hundred thousand Saracens,\ntheir helmets bedecked with gold, their shields shining in the sun,\nbesought his friend to sound his horn, the olifant, and summon the king to\ntheir aid.",
        "“Never will I so disgrace myself!” exclaimed Roland. “Never shall sweet\nFrance be so dishonored. One hundred thousand blows shall I give with my\nsword, my Durendal, and the Moors will fall and die!”",
        "When Olivier found his pleading vain, he mounted his steed and rode with\nRoland to the front of the lines.",
        "Long was the fight and terrible. If gallantry and strength sat with the\ntwelve peers and their followers, they were with their opponents as well.\nNo sooner had Roland, or Olivier, or Turpin, or Engelier cleft the body of\na Moorish knight down to the saddle, than down fell a Christian, his\nhelmet broken, his hauberk torn by the lance of his dreaded foe. The\nnephew of Marsile fell by the hand of Roland, who taunted him as he lay in\ndeath; Olivier struck down Marsile’s brother. “A noble stroke!” cried\nRoland.",
        "“A baron’s stroke!” exclaimed the archbishop, as Samsun pierced the\nAlmazour with his lance and he fell dead. Olivier spurred over the field,\ncrushing the pagans and beating them down with his broken lance.",
        "“Comrade, where is thy sword, thy Halteclere?” called Roland to his\nfriend.",
        "“Here, but I lack time to draw it,” replied the doughty Olivier.",
        "More than a thousand blows struck Turpin; the pagans fell by hundreds and\nby thousands, and over the field lay scattered those who would nevermore\nsee sweet France.",
        "Meanwhile, in France, hail fell and rain; the sky was vivid with lightning\nbolts. The earth shook, and the land lay in darkness at noonday. None\nunderstood the portent. Alas! it was Nature’s grief at the death of Count\nRoland.",
        "When Roland perceived that in spite of their mighty efforts the passes\nwere still filled with heathen knights, and the French ranks were fast\nthinning, he said to Olivier, “What think you if we call the king?”",
        "“Never!” exclaimed Olivier. “Better death now than shame!”",
        "“If I blow, Carle will hear it now and return. I shall blow my olifant,\"\ncried Roland.",
        "“When I begged you to blow it,” said Olivier, “you refused, when you could\nhave saved the lives of all of us. You will show no valor if you blow it\nnow.”",
        "“Great is the strife,” said Roland. “I will blow that Carle may come.”",
        "“Then,” said Olivier, “if I return to France, I pledge you my word my\nsister Aude shall never be your wife. Your rashness has been the cause of\nour destruction. Now you shall die here, and here ends our friendship.”",
        "Across the field the archbishop spurred to reconcile the friends. “Carle\nwill come too late to save our lives,” said he, “but he will reach the\nfield in time to preserve our mangled bodies and wreak vengeance on our\nfoes.”",
        "Roland put his horn to his lips and blew with such force that his temples\nburst and the crimson blood poured forth from his mouth. Three times he\nsounded his horn, and each time the sound brought anguish to the heart of\nCarle, who heard it, riding thirty leagues away. “Our men make battle!\"\ncried he; but this Ganelon hastened to deny, insisting that Roland was but\nhunting and blowing the horn, taking sport among the peers. But Duke\nNaimes exclaimed, “Your nephew is in sore distress. He who would deceive\nyou is a traitor. Haste! Shout your war-cry, and let us return to the\nbattle-field. You yourself hear plainly his call for help!”",
        "Commanding Ganelon to be seized and given to the scullions of his house to\nbe kept for punishment until his return, Carle ordered his men to arm and\nreturn to Roncesvalles, that they might, if possible, save the lives of\nthe noble peers. All the army wept aloud as they thought of the doom of\nRoland. High were the mountains, deep the valleys, swift the rushing\nstreams. The French rode on, answering the sound of the olifant; the\nemperor rode, filled with grief and rage; the barons spurred their horses,\nbut in vain.",
        "After Roland had sounded the horn he again grasped Durendal, and, mounted\non his horse Veillantif, scoured the battle-field, cutting down the\nheathen. But still their troops pressed him, and when he saw the Ethiopian\nband led by the uncle of Marsile, he knew his doom had come. Olivier,\nriding forth to meet the accursed band, received his death-wound from the\nKalif, but lived to cut his enemy down, and call Roland to him. Alas!\nsight had forsaken his eyes, and as he sat on his steed he lifted his\nbright sword Halteclere, and struck Roland a fearful blow that clove his\ncrest but did not touch his head. “Was the blow meant for me, my comrade?\"\nasked Roland softly. “Nay, I can see no more. God pity me! Pardon me, my\nfriend!” and as the two embraced each other, Olivier fell dead.",
        "Then, in the agony of his grief, Roland fainted, sitting firm in his\nsaddle, and again recovering consciousness, became aware of the terrible\nlosses of the French. Only himself, the archbishop, and the gallant\nGaultier de l’Hum were left to defend the honor of the French. After\nGaultier fell, Roland, unassisted save by Turpin, who fought transfixed by\nfour spear shafts, put the enemy to flight. Feeling his death wounds,\nRoland besought Turpin to let him bring together the bodies of his fallen\ncomrades that they might receive the blessing of the archbishop. Weak and\ntrembling from loss of blood, Roland passed to and fro over the\ncorpse-bestrewn field, and gathered together his comrades: here, Gerin and\nGerier, Berengier and Otun; there, Anseis, Samsun, and Gerard de\nRoussillon, and last of all, his beloved Olivier, and placing them before\nthe knees of Turpin, he saw them receive his blessing.",
        "In his great grief at the sight of the dead Olivier, Roland again fainted,\nand Turpin hastened to a little brook near by for water to revive him. But\nthe strain was too great for his already weakened body, and, when Roland\nrevived, it was to find the archbishop dead.",
        "Then Roland, realizing that his hour, too, had come, sought out a place in\nwhich to die. Upon a hill between two lofty trees, where was a marble\nterrace, he placed himself with his head towards the enemy’s country; and\nthere a Saracen, who had feigned death to escape it, tried to wrest from\nhim his beloved Durendal.",
        "Roland crushed the pagan’s head with his olifant, but now he was troubled,\nfor he feared that his sword would fall into other than Christian hands.\nIll could he bear to be parted from his beloved sword. Its golden hilt\ncontained rare relics,–a tooth of Saint Peter, blood, hair, and bones of\nother saints, and by the strength of these holy relics it had conquered\nvast realms. Ten and more mighty blows he struck with Durendal upon the\nhard rock of the terrace, in the endeavor to break it; but it neither\nbroke nor blunted. Then, counting over his great victories, he placed it\nand the olifant beneath him, and committed his soul to the Father, who\nsent down his angels to bear it to Paradise.",
        "When the French army, led by Charlemagne, found the passes heaped high\nwith the bodies of the dead and no living soul to tell the story of the\nslaughter, they wept, and many fell swooning to the earth. But the enraged\nCharlemagne, unwilling then to give time for mourning, spurred on his\nsoldiers, overtook the fleeing enemy, and drove them into the Ebro, so\nthat those who survived the sword, perished by the wave. Then, returning\nto the field of Roncesvalles, he wept over his beloved Roland and the\npeers.",
        "Great was his grief; handfuls of hair he tore from his head, and many\ntimes wished that his soul were in Paradise, and his body beside that of\nRoland. He commanded that the hearts of Roland, Olivier, and Turpin be\ntaken from their bodies, wrapped, and inurned, and the bodies borne home\nin chariots. The bodies of the others were gathered together in one tomb,\nand assoiled and blessed by the priests who accompanied the army.",
        "As Charlemagne prepared to start for France, he saw a new army\napproaching. The aged Emir Baligant, from Babylon, who had long ago been\nsummoned by Marsile, had just arrived in Saragossa, and hastened forth to\nmeet Charlemagne. The emir’s army was countless, and Charlemagne’s was\nweakened by its great loss. But the thought of the slaughtered peers\nspurred on the French, and with great Carle for their leader, they quickly\nput the pagans to flight.",
        "The Franks pursued the enemy to Saragossa, where the wounded Marsile\nexpired on hearing of his defeat. The city was taken, its inhabitants\neither slain, or converted and baptized, and Queen Bramimunde taken to\nFrance to be won to the true faith by gentler means.",
        "When Charlemagne entered his stately palace at Aix, he was met by the fair\nlady Aude.",
        "“Where is Roland, my betrothed?”",
        "Carle wept, tearing his white beard.",
        "“Thou askest of one who is no more. But in his place I will give thee my\nson. I can do no better.”",
        "“Nay, God forbid that I should live if Roland is dead;” and so saying,\nAude, the beautiful, fell dead at the feet of the emperor.",
        "From all his lands Carle summoned men to Aix for the trial of Ganelon.",
        "“Judge him according to the law, my barons,” said the king. “He lost me\ntwenty thousand of my Franks. My nephew Roland, Olivier, my twelve peers,\nhe sold.”",
        "“My king,” pleaded Ganelon, “call it not treason. I was ever loyal to you.\nI thought not of gain, but of revenge against my rebellious and haughty\nstep-son.”",
        "The sentiment of many was with Ganelon, and Pinabel offered to fight for\nhim against Thierri, the champion of the king. Thirty knights of his kin\ngave themselves as legal sureties of his pledge, and the combat began.\nPinabel was conquered and slain, and Ganelon was condemned to be torn to\npieces by wild horses. His thirty sureties were also compelled to suffer\ndeath.",
        "Ganelon was punished; Bramimunde was made a Christian, and the emperor\nthought at last to have peace. But as night fell and he sought rest in his\nlofty room, Gabriel appeared to him.",
        "“Summon thy hosts and march into Bire to succor King Vivien. The\nChristians look to thee for help.”",
        "The king wept and tore his beard. “So troubled is my life!” said he.",
