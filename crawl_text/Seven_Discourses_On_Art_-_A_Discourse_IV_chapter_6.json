        "Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy on the Distribution\nof the Prizes, December 10, 1771, by the President.",
        "Gentlemen,–The value and rank of every art is in proportion to the\nmental labour employed in it, or the mental pleasure produced by\nit.  As this principle is observed or neglected, our profession\nbecomes either a liberal art or a mechanical trade.  In the hands\nof one man it makes the highest pretensions, as it is addressed to\nthe noblest faculties, In those of another it is reduced to a mere\nmatter of ornament, and the painter has but the humble province of\nfurnishing our apartments with elegance.",
        "This exertion of mind, which is the only circumstance that truly\nennobles our art, makes the great distinction between the Roman and\nVenetian schools.  I have formerly observed that perfect form is\nproduced by leaving out particularities, and retaining only general\nideas.  I shall now endeavour to show that this principle, which I\nhave proved to be metaphysically just, extends itself to every part\nof the art; that it gives what is called the grand style to\ninvention, to composition, to expression, and even to colouring and\ndrapery.",
        "Invention in painting does not imply the invention of the subject,\nfor that is commonly supplied by the poet or historian.  With\nrespect to the choice, no subject can be proper that is not\ngenerally interesting.  It ought to be either some eminent instance\nof heroic action or heroic suffering.  There must be something\neither in the action or in the object in which men are universally\nconcerned, and which powerfully strikes upon the public sympathy.",
        "Strictly speaking, indeed, no subject can be of universal, hardly\ncan it be of general concern:  but there are events and characters\nso popularly known in those countries where our art is in request,\nthat they may be considered as sufficiently general for all our\npurposes.  Such are the great events of Greek and Roman fable and\nhistory, which early education and the usual course of reading have\nmade familiar and interesting to all Europe, without being degraded\nby the vulgarism of ordinary life in any country.  Such, too, are\nthe capital subjects of Scripture history, which, besides their\ngeneral notoriety, become venerable by their connection with our\nreligion.",
        "As it is required that the subject selected should be a general\none, it is no less necessary that it should be kept unembarrassed\nwith whatever may any way serve to divide the attention of the\nspectator.  Whenever a story is related, every man forms a picture\nin his mind of the action and the expression of the persons\nemployed.  The power of representing this mental picture in canvas\nis what we call invention in a painter.  And as in the conception\nof this ideal picture the mind does not enter into the minute\npeculiarities of the dress, furniture, or scene of action, so when\nthe painter comes to represent it he contrives those little\nnecessary concomitant circumstances in such a manner that they\nshall strike the spectator no more than they did himself in his\nfirst conception of the story.",
        "I am very ready to allow that some circumstances of minuteness and\nparticularity frequently tend to give an air of truth to a piece,\nand to interest the spectator in an extraordinary manner.  Such\ncircumstances, therefore, cannot wholly be rejected; but if there\nbe anything in the art which requires peculiar nicety of\ndiscernment, it is the disposition of these minute circumstantial\nparts which, according to the judgment employed in the choice,\nbecome so useful to truth or so injurious to grandeur.",
        "However, the usual and most dangerous error is on the side of\nminuteness, and, therefore, I think caution most necessary where\nmost have failed.  The general idea constitutes real excellence.\nAll smaller things, however perfect in their way, are to be\nsacrificed without mercy to the greater.  The painter will not\ninquire what things may be admitted without much censure.  He will\nnot think it enough to show that they may be there; he will show\nthat they must be there, that their absence would render his\npicture maimed and defective.",
        "Thus, though to the principal group a second or third be added, and\na second and third mass of light, care must be yet taken that these\nsubordinate actions and lights, neither each in particular, nor all\ntogether, come into any degree of competition with the principal;\nthey should make a part of that whole which would be imperfect\nwithout them.  To every part of painting this rule may be applied.\nEven in portraits, the grace and, we may add, the likeness,\nconsists more in taking the general air than in observing the\neffect similitude of every feature.",
        "Thus figures must have a ground whereon to stand; they must be\nclothed, there must be a background, there must be light and\nshadow; but none of these ought to appear to have taken up any part\nof the artist’s attention.  They should be so managed as not even\nto catch that of the spectator.  We know well enough, when we\nanalyse a piece, the difficulty and the subtlety with which an\nartist adjusts the background, drapery, and masses of light; we\nknow that a considerable part of the grace and effect of his\npicture depends upon them; but this art is so much concealed, even\nto a judicious eye, that no remains of any of these subordinate\nparts occur to memory when the picture is not present.",
        "The great end of the art is to strike the imagination.  The painter\nis, therefore, to make no ostentation of the means by which this is\ndone; the spectator is only to feel the result in his bosom.  An\ninferior artist is unwilling that any part of his industry should\nbe lost upon the spectator.  He takes as much pains to discover, as\nthe greater artist does to conceal, the marks of his subordinate\nassiduity.  In works of the lower kind everything appears studied\nand encumbered; it is all boastful art and open affectation.  The\nignorant often part from such pictures with wonder in their mouths,\nand indifference in their hearts.",
        "But it is not enough in invention that the artist should restrain\nand keep under all the inferior parts of his subject; he must\nsometimes deviate from vulgar and strict historical truth in\npursuing the grandeur of his design.",
        "How much the great style exacts from its professors to conceive and\nrepresent their subjects in a poetical manner, not confined to mere\nmatter of fact, may be seen in the cartoons of Raffaelle.  In all\nthe pictures in which the painter has represented the apostles, he\nhas drawn them with great nobleness; he has given them as much\ndignity as the human figure is capable of receiving yet we are\nexpressly told in Scripture they had no such respectable\nappearance; and of St. Paul in particular, we are told by himself,\nthat his bodily presence was mean.  Alexander is said to have been\nof a low stature:  a painter ought not so to represent him.\nAgesilaus was low, lame, and of a mean appearance.  None of these\ndefects ought to appear in a piece of which he is the hero.  In\nconformity to custom, I call this part of the art history painting;\nit ought to be called poetical, as in reality it is.",
        "All this is not falsifying any fact; it is taking an allowed\npoetical licence.  A painter of portraits retains the individual\nlikeness; a painter of history shows the man by showing his\nactions.  A painter must compensate the natural deficiencies of his\nart.  He has but one sentence to utter, but one moment to exhibit.\nHe cannot, like the poet or historian, expatiate, and impress the\nmind with great veneration for the character of the hero or saint\nhe represents, though he lets us know at the same time that the\nsaint was deformed, or the hero lame.  The painter has no other\nmeans of giving an idea of the dignity of the mind, but by that\nexternal appearance which grandeur of thought does generally,\nthough not always, impress on the countenance, and by that\ncorrespondence of figure to sentiment and situation which all men\nwish, but cannot command.  The painter, who may in this one\nparticular attain with ease what others desire in vain, ought to\ngive all that he possibly can, since there are so many\ncircumstances of true greatness that he cannot give at all.  He\ncannot make his hero talk like a great man; he must make him look\nlike one.  For which reason he ought to be well studied in the\nanalysis of those circumstances which constitute dignity of\nappearance in real life.",
        "As in invention, so likewise in, expression, care must be taken not\nto run into particularities, Those expressions alone should be\ngiven to the figures which their respective situations generally\nproduce.  Nor is this enough; each person should also have that\nexpression which men of his rank generally exhibit.  The joy or the\ngrief of a character of dignity is not to be expressed in the same\nmanner as a similar passion in a vulgar face.  Upon this principle\nBernini, perhaps, may be subject to censure.  This sculptor, in\nmany respects admirable, has given a very mean expression to his\nstatue of David, who is represented as just going to throw the\nstone from the sling; and in order to give it the expression of\nenergy he has made him biting his under-lip.  This expression is\nfar from being general, and still farther from being dignified.  He\nmight have seen it in an instance or two, and he mistook accident\nfor universality.",
        "With respect to colouring, though it may appear at first a part of\npainting merely mechanical, yet it still has its rules, and those\ngrounded upon that presiding principle which regulates both the\ngreat and the little in the study of a painter.  By this, the first\neffect of the picture is produced; and as this is performed the\nspectator, as he walks the gallery, will stop, or pass along.  To\ngive a general air of grandeur at first view, all trifling or\nartful play of little lights or an attention to a variety of tints\nis to be avoided; a quietness and simplicity must reign over the\nwhole work; to which a breadth of uniform and simple colour will\nvery much contribute.  Grandeur of effect is produced by two\ndifferent ways, which seem entirely opposed to each other.  One is,\nby reducing the colours to little more than chiaroscuro, which was\noften the practice of the Bolognian schools; and the other, by\nmaking the colours very distinct and forcible, such as we see in\nthose of Rome and Florence; but still, the presiding principle of\nboth those manners is simplicity.  Certainly, nothing can be more\nsimple than monotony, and the distinct blue, red, and yellow\ncolours which are seen in the draperies of the Roman and Florentine\nschools, though they have not that kind of harmony which is\nproduced by a variety of broken and transparent colours, have that\neffect of grandeur that was intended.  Perhaps these distinct\ncolours strike the mind more forcibly, from there not being any\ngreat union between them; as martial music, which is intended to\nrouse the noble passions, has its effect from the sudden and\nstrongly marked transitions from one note to another, which that\nstyle of music requires; whilst in that which is intended to move\nthe softer passions the notes imperceptibly melt into one another.",
        "In the same manner as the historical painter never enters into the\ndetail of colours, so neither does he debase his conceptions with\nminute attention to the discriminations of drapery.  It is the\ninferior style that marks the variety of stuffs.  With him, the\nclothing is neither woollen, nor linen, nor silk, satin, or velvet:\nit is drapery; it is nothing more.  The art of disposing the\nfoldings of the drapery make a very considerable part of the\npainter’s study.  To make it merely natural is a mechanical\noperation, to which neither genius or taste are required; whereas,\nit requires the nicest judgment to dispose the drapery, so that the\nfolds have an easy communication, and gracefully follow each other,\nwith such natural negligence as to look like the effect of chance,\nand at the same time show the figure under it to the utmost\nadvantage.",
        "Carlo Maratti was of opinion that the disposition of drapery was a\nmore difficult art than even that of drawing the human figure; that\na student might be more easily taught the latter than the former;\nas the rules of drapery, he said, could not be so well ascertained\nas those for delineating a correct form, This, perhaps, is a proof\nhow willingly we favour our own peculiar excellence.  Carlo Maratti\nis said to have valued himself particularly upon his skill in this\npart of the art yet in him the disposition appears so artificial,\nthat he is inferior to Raffaelle, even in that which gave him his\nbest claim to reputation",
        "Such is the great principle by which we must be directed in the\nnobler branches of our art.  Upon this principle the Roman, the\nFlorentine, the Bolognese schools, have formed their practice; and\nby this they have deservedly obtained the highest praise.  These\nare the three great schools of the world in the epic style.  The\nbest of the French school, Poussin, Le Sueur, and Le Brun, have\nformed themselves upon these models, and consequently may be said,\nthough Frenchmen, to be a colony from the Roman school.  Next to\nthese, but in a very different style of excellence, we may rank the\nVenetian, together with the Flemish and the Dutch schools, all\nprofessing to depart from the great purposes of painting, and\ncatching at applause by inferior qualities.",
        "I am not ignorant that some will censure me for placing the\nVenetians in this inferior class, and many of the warmest admirers\nof painting will think them unjustly degraded; but I wish not to be\nmisunderstood.  Though I can by no means allow them to hold any\nrank with the nobler schools of painting, they accomplished\nperfectly the thing they attempted.  But as mere elegance is their\nprincipal object, as they seem more willing to dazzle than to\naffect, it can be no injury to them to suppose that their practice\nis useful only to its proper end.  But what may heighten the\nelegant may degrade the sublime.  There is a simplicity, and I may\nadd, severity, in the great manner, which is, I am afraid, almost\nincompatible with this comparatively sensual style.",
        "Tintoret, Paul Veronese, and others of the Venetian schools, seem\nto have painted with no other purpose than to be admired for their\nskill and expertness in the mechanism of painting, and to make a\nparade of that art which, as I before observed, the higher style\nrequires its followers to conceal.",
        "In a conference of the French Academy, at which were present Le\nBrun, Sebastian Bourdon, and all the eminent artists of that age,\none of the academicians desired to have their opinion on the\nconduct of Paul Veronese, who, though a painter of great\nconsideration, had, contrary to the strict rules of art, in his\npicture of Perseus and Andromeda, represented the principal figure\nin shade.  To this question no satisfactory answer was then given.\nBut I will venture to say, that if they had considered the class of\nthe artist, and ranked him as an ornamental painter, there would\nhave been no difficulty in answering:  “It was unreasonable to\nexpect what was never intended.  His intention was solely to\nproduce an effect of light and Shadow; everything was to be\nsacrificed to that intent, and the capricious composition of that\npicture suited very well with the style he professed.”",
        "Young minds are indeed too apt to be captivated by this splendour\nof style, and that of the Venetians will be particularly pleasing;\nfor by them all those parts of the art that give pleasure to the\neye or sense have been cultivated with care, and carried to the\ndegree nearest to perfection.  The powers exerted in the mechanical\npart of the art have been called the language of painters; but we\nmust say, that it is but poor eloquence which only shows that the\norator can talk.  Words should be employed as the means, not as the\nend:  language is the instrument, conviction is the work.",
        "The language of painting must indeed be allowed these masters; but\neven in that they have shown more copiousness than choice, and more\nluxuriancy than judgment.  If we consider the uninteresting\nsubjects of their invention, or at least the uninteresting manner\nin which they are treated; if we attend to their capricious\ncomposition, their violent and affected contrasts, whether of\nfigures, or of light and shadow, the richness of their drapery,\nand, at the same time, the mean effect which the discrimination of\nstuffs gives to their pictures; if to these we add their total\ninattention to expression, and then reflect on the conceptions and\nthe learning of Michael Angelo, or the simplicity of Raffaelle, we\ncan no longer dwell on the comparison.  Even in colouring, if we\ncompare the quietness and chastity of the Bolognese pencil to the\nbustle and tumult that fills every part of, a Venetian picture,\nwithout the least attempt to interest the passions, their boasted\nart will appear a mere struggle without effect; an empty tale told\nby an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.",
        "Such as suppose that the great style might happily be blended with\nthe ornamental, that the simple, grave, and majestic dignity of\nRaffaelle could unite with the glow and bustle of a Paulo or\nTintoret, are totally mistaken.  The principles by which each are\nattained are so contrary to each other, that they seem, in my\nopinion, incompatible, and as impossible to exist together, as to\nunite in the mind at the same time the most sublime ideas and the\nlowest sensuality.",
        "The subjects of the Venetian painters are mostly such as give them\nan opportunity of introducing a great number of figures, such as\nfeasts, marriages, and processions, public martyrdoms, or miracles.\nI can easily conceive that Paul Veronese, if he were asked, would\nsay that no subject was proper for an historical picture but such\nas admitted at least forty figures; for in a less number, he would\nassert, there could be no opportunity of the painter’s showing his\nart in composition, his dexterity of managing and disposing the\nmasses of light, and groups of figures, and of introducing a\nvariety of Eastern dresses and characters in their rich stuffs.",
        "But the thing is very different with a pupil of the greater\nschools.  Annibale Caracci thought twelve figures sufficient for\nany story:  he conceived that more would contribute to no end but\nto fill space; that they would, be but cold spectators of the\ngeneral action, or, to use his own expression, that they would be\nfigures to be let.  Besides, it is impossible for a picture\ncomposed of so many parts to have that effect, so indispensably\nnecessary to grandeur, of one complete whole.  However\ncontradictory it may be in geometry, it is true in taste, that many\nlittle things will not make a great one.  The sublime impresses the\nmind at once with one great idea; it is a single blow:  the elegant\nindeed may be produced by a repetition, by an accumulation of many\nminute circumstances.",
        "However great the difference is between the composition of the\nVenetian and the rest of the Italian schools, there is full as\ngreat a disparity in the effect of their pictures as produced by\ncolours.  And though in this respect the Venetians must be allowed\nextraordinary skill, yet even that skill, as they have employed it,\nwill but ill correspond with the great style.  Their colouring is\nnot only too brilliant, but, I will venture to say, too harmonious\nto produce that solidity, steadiness, and simplicity of effect\nwhich heroic subjects require, and which simple or grave colours\nonly can give to a work.  That they are to be cautiously studied by\nthose who are ambitious of treading the great walk of history is\nconfirmed, if it wants confirmation, by the greatest of all\nauthorities, Michael Angelo.  This wonderful man, after having seen\na picture by Titian, told Vasari, who accompanied him, “that he\nliked much his colouring and manner; but then he added, that it was\na pity the Venetian painters did not learn to draw correctly in\ntheir early youth, and adopt a better manner of study.”",
        "By this it appears that the principal attention of the Venetian\npainters, in the opinion of Michael Angelo, seemed to be engrossed\nby the study of colours, to the neglect of the ideal beauty of\nform, or propriety of expression.  But if general censure was given\nto that school from the sight of a picture of Titian, how much more\nheavily, and more justly, would the censure fall on Paulo Veronese,\nor more especially on Tintoret?  And here I cannot avoid citing\nVasari’s opinion of the style and manner of Tintoret.  “Of all the\nextraordinary geniuses,” says he, “that have ever practised the art\nof painting, for wild, capricious, extravagant, and fantastical\ninventions, for furious impetuosity and boldness in the execution\nof his work, there is none like Tintoret; his strange whims are\neven beyond extravagance; and his works seem to be produced rather\nby chance than in consequence of any previous design, as if he\nwanted to convince the world that, the art was a trifle, and of the\nmost easy attainment.”",
        "For my own part, when I speak of the Venetian painters, I wish to\nbe understood to mean Paulo Veronese and Tintoret, to the exclusion\nof Titian; for though his style is not so pure as that of many\nother of the Italian schools, yet there is a sort of senatorial\ndignity about him, which, however awkward in his imitators, seems\nto become him exceedingly.  His portraits alone, from the nobleness\nand simplicity of character which he always gave them, will entitle\nhim to the greatest respect, as he undoubtedly stands in the first\nrank in this branch of the art.",
        "It is not with Titian, but with the seducing qualities of the two\nformer, that I could wish to caution you, against being too much\ncaptivated.  These are the persons who may be said to have\nexhausted all the powers of florid eloquence, to debauch the young\nand unexperienced, and have, without doubt, been the cause of\nturning off the attention of the connoisseur and of the patron of\nart, as well as that of the painter, from those higher excellences\nof which the art is capable, and which ought to be required in\nevery considerable production.  By them, and their imitators, a\nstyle merely ornamental has been disseminated throughout all\nEurope.  Rubens carried it to Flanders, Voet to France, and Luca\nGiordano to Spain and Naples.",
        "The Venetian is indeed the most splendid of the schools of\nelegance; and it is not without reason that the best performances\nin this lower school are valued higher than the second-rate\nperformances of those above them; for every picture has value when\nit has a decided character, and is excellent in its kind.  But the\nstudent must take care not to be so much dazzled with this\nsplendour as to be tempted to imitate what must ultimately lead\nfrom perfection.  Poussin, whose eye was always steadily fixed on\nthe sublime, has been often heard to say, “That a particular\nattention to colouring was an obstacle to the student in his\nprogress to the great end and design of the art; and that he who\nattaches himself to this principal end will acquire by practice a\nreasonably good method of colouring.”",
        "Though it be allowed that elaborate harmony of colouring, a\nbrilliancy of tints, a soft and gradual transition from one to\nanother, present to the eye what an harmonious concert of music\ndoes to the ear, it must be remembered that painting is not merely\na gratification of the sight.  Such excellence, though properly\ncultivated where nothing higher than elegance is intended, is weak\nand unworthy of regard, when the work aspires to grandeur and\nsublimity.",
        "The same reasons that have been urged why a mixture of the Venetian\nstyle cannot improve the great style will hold good in regard to\nthe Flemish and Dutch schools.  Indeed, the Flemish school, of\nwhich Rubens is the head, was formed upon that of the Venetian;\nlike them, he took his figures too much from the people before him.\nBut it must be allowed in favour of the Venetians that he was more\ngross than they, and carried all their mistaken methods to a far\ngreater excess.  In the Venetian school itself, where they all err\nfrom the same cause, there is a difference in the effect.  The\ndifference between Paulo and Bassano seems to be only that one\nintroduced Venetian gentlemen into his pictures, and the other the\nboors of the district of Bassano, and called them patriarchs and\nprophets.",
        "The painters of the Dutch school have still more locality.  With\nthem, a history piece is properly a portrait of themselves; whether\nthey describe the inside or outside of their houses, we have their\nown people engaged in their own peculiar occupations, working or\ndrinking, playing or fighting.  The circumstances that enter into a\npicture of this kind are so far from giving a general view of human\nlife that they exhibit all the minute particularities of a nation\ndiffering in several respects from the rest of mankind.  Yet, let\nthem have their share of more humble praise.  The painters of this\nschool are excellent in their own way; they are only ridiculous\nwhen they attempt general history on their own narrow principles,\nand debase great events by the meanness of their characters.",
        "Some inferior dexterity, some extraordinary mechanical power, is\napparently that from which they seek distinction.  Thus, we see,\nthat school alone has the custom of representing candle-light, not\nas it really appears to us by night, but red, as it would\nilluminate objects to a spectator by day.  Such tricks, however\npardonable in the little style, where petty effects are the sole\nend, are inexcusable in the greater, where the attention should\nnever be drawn aside by trifles, but should be entirely occupied by\nthe subject itself.",
        "The same local principles which characterise the Dutch school\nextend even to their landscape painters; and Rubens himself, who\nhas painted many landscapes, has sometimes transgressed in this\nparticular.  Their pieces in this way are, I think, always a\nrepresentation of an individual spot, and each in its kind a very\nfaithful but very confined portrait.",
        "Claude Lorraine, on the contrary, was convinced that taking nature\nas he found it seldom produced beauty.  His pictures are a\ncomposition of the various draughts which he has previously made\nfrom various beautiful scenes and prospects.  However, Rubens in\nsome measure has made amends for the deficiency with which he is\ncharged; he has contrived to raise and animate his otherwise\nuninteresting views, by introducing a rainbow, storm, or some\nparticular accidental effect of light.  That the practice of Claude\nLorraine, in respect to his choice, is to be adopted by landscape\npainters, in opposition to that of the Flemish and Dutch schools,\nthere can be no doubt, as its truth is founded upon the same\nprinciple as that by which the historical painter acquires perfect\nform.  But whether landscape painting has a right to aspire so far\nas to reject what the painters call accidents of nature is not easy\nto determine.  It is certain Claude Lorraine seldom, if ever,\navailed himself of those accidents; either he thought that such\npeculiarities were contrary to that style of general nature which\nhe professed, or that it would catch the attention too strongly,\nand destroy that quietness and repose which he thought necessary to\nthat kind of painting.",
        "A portrait painter likewise, when he attempts history, unless he is\nupon his guard, is likely to enter too much into the detail.  He\ntoo frequently makes his historical heads look like portraits; and\nthis was once the custom amongst those old painters who revived the\nart before general ideas were practised or understood.  A history\npainter paints man in general; a portrait painter, a particular\nman, and consequently a defective model.",
        "Thus an habitual practice in the lower exercises of the art will\nprevent many from attaining the greater.  But such of us who move\nin these humbler walks of the profession are not ignorant that, as\nthe natural dignity of the subject is less, the more all the little\nornamental helps are necessary to its embellishment.  It would be\nridiculous for a painter of domestic scenes, of portraits,\nlandscapes, animals, or of still life, to say that he despised\nthose qualities which have made the subordinate schools so famous.\nThe art of colouring, and the skilful management of light and\nshadow, are essential requisites in his confined labours.  If we\ndescend still lower, what is the painter of fruit and flowers\nwithout the utmost art in colouring, and what the painters call\nhandling; that is, a lightness of pencil that implies great\npractice, and gives the appearance of being done with ease?  Some\nhere, I believe, must remember a flower-painter whose boast it was\nthat he scorned to paint for the million; no, he professed to paint\nin the true Italian taste; and despising the crowd, called\nstrenuously upon the few to admire him.  His idea of the Italian\ntaste was to paint as black and dirty as he could, and to leave all\nclearness and brilliancy of colouring to those who were fonder of\nmoney than of immortality.  The consequence was such as might be\nexpected.  For these pretty excellences are here essential\nbeauties; and without this merit the artist’s work will be more\nshort-lived than the objects of his imitation.",
        "From what has been advanced, we must now be convinced that there\nare two distinct styles in history painting:  the grand, and the\nsplendid or ornamental.",
        "The great style stands alone, and does not require, perhaps does\nnot so well admit, any addition from inferior beauties.  The\nornamental style also possesses its own peculiar merit.  However,\nthough the union of the two may make a sort of composite style, yet\nthat style is likely to be more imperfect than either of those\nwhich go to its composition.  Both kinds have merit, and may be\nexcellent though in different ranks, if uniformity be preserved,\nand the general and particular ideas of nature be not mixed.  Even\nthe meanest of them is difficult enough to attain; and the first\nplace being already occupied by the great artists in either\ndepartment, some of those who followed thought there was less room\nfor them, and feeling the impulse of ambition and the desire of\nnovelty, and being at the same time perhaps willing to take the\nshortest way, they endeavoured to make for themselves a place\nbetween both.  This they have effected by forming a union of the\ndifferent orders.  But as the grave and majestic style would suffer\nby a union with the florid and gay, so also has the Venetian\nornament in some respect been injured by attempting an alliance\nwith simplicity.",
        "It may be asserted that the great style is always more or less\ncontaminated by any meaner mixture.  But it happens in a few\ninstances that the lower may be improved by borrowing from the\ngrand.  Thus, if a portrait painter is desirous to raise and\nimprove his subject, he has no other means than by approaching it\nto a general idea.  He leaves out all the minute breaks and\npeculiarities in the face, and changes the dress from a temporary\nfashion to one more permanent, which has annexed to it no ideas of\nmeanness from its being familiar to us.  But if an exact\nresemblance of an individual be considered as the sole object to be\naimed at, the portrait painter will be apt to lose more than he\ngains by the acquired dignity taken from general nature.  It is\nvery difficult to ennoble the character of a countenance but at the\nexpense of the likeness, which is what is most generally required\nby such as sit to the painter.",
        "Of those who have practised the composite style, and have succeeded\nin this perilous attempt, perhaps the foremost is Correggio.  His\nstyle is founded upon modern grace and elegance, to which is super,\nadded something of the simplicity of the grand style.  A breadth of\nlight and colour, the general ideas of the drapery, an\nuninterrupted flow of outline, all conspire to this effect.  Next\nhim (perhaps equal to him) Parmegiano has dignified the genteelness\nof modern effeminacy by uniting it with the simplicity of the\nancients and the grandeur and severity of Michael Angelo.  It must\nbe confessed, however, that these two extraordinary men, by\nendeavouring to give the utmost degree of grace, have sometimes,\nperhaps, exceeded its boundaries, and have fallen into the most\nhateful of all hateful qualities, affectation.  Indeed, it is the\npeculiar characteristic of men of genius to be afraid of coldness\nand insipidity, from which they think they never can be too far\nremoved.  It particularly happens to these great masters of grace\nand elegance.  They often boldly drive on to the very verge of\nridicule; the spectator is alarmed, but at the same time admires\ntheir vigour and intrepidity.",
        "Strange graces still, and stranger flights they had,\n. . .\nYet ne’er so sure our passion to create\nAe when they touch’d the brink of all we hate.",
        "The errors of genius, however, are pardonable, and none even of the\nmore exalted painters are wholly free from them; but they have\ntaught us, by the rectitude of their general practice, to correct\ntheir own affected or accidental deviation.  The very first have\nnot been always upon their guard, and perhaps there is not a fault\nbut what may take shelter under the most venerable authorities; yet\nthat style only is perfect in which the noblest principles are\nuniformly pursued; and those masters only are entitled to the first\nrank in, our estimation who have enlarged the boundaries of their\nart, and have raised it to its highest dignity, by exhibiting the\ngeneral ideas of nature.",
        "On the whole, it seems to me that there is but one presiding\nprinciple which regulates and gives stability to every art.  The\nworks, whether of poets, painters, moralists, or historians, which\nare built upon general nature, live for ever; while those which\ndepend for their existence on particular customs and habits, a\npartial view of nature, or the fluctuation of fashion, can only be\ncoeval with that which first raised them from obscurity.  Present\ntime and future maybe considered as rivals, and he who solicits the\none must expect to be discountenanced by the other.",
