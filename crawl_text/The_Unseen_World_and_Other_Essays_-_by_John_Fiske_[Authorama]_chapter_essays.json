        "Life has now and then some supreme moments of pure happiness,\nwhich in reminiscence give to single days the value of months\nor years. Two or three such moments it has been my good fortune\nto enjoy with you, in talking over the mysteries which forever\nfascinate while they forever baffle us. It was our midnight talks\nin Great Russell Street and the Addison Road, and our bright May\nholiday on the Thames, that led me to write this scanty essay on\nthe “Unseen World,” and to whom could I so heartily dedicate it\nas to you? I only wish it were more worthy of its origin. As for\nthe dozen papers which I have appended to it, by way of clearing\nout my workshop, I hope you will read them indulgently, and\nbelieve\nme",

        "“What are you, where did you come from, and whither are you\nbound?\"—the question which from Homer’s days has been put to the\nwayfarer in strange lands—is likewise the all-absorbing question\nwhich man is ever asking of the universe of which he is himself\nso tiny yet so wondrous a part. From the earliest times the\nultimate purpose of all scientific research has been to elicit\nfragmentary or partial responses to this question, and philosophy\nhas ever busied itself in piecing together these several bits of\ninformation according to the best methods at its disposal, in\norder to make up something like a satisfactory answer. In old\ntimes the best methods which philosophy had at its disposal for\nthis purpose were such as now seem very crude, and accordingly\nancient philosophers bungled considerably in their task, though\nnow and then they came surprisingly near what would to-day be\ncalled the truth. It was natural that their methods should be\ncrude, for scientific inquiry had as yet supplied but scanty\nmaterials for them to work with, and it was only after a very\nlong course of speculation and criticism that men could find out\nwhat ways of going to work are likely to prove successful and\nwhat are not. The earliest thinkers, indeed, were further\nhindered from accomplishing much by the imperfections of the\nlanguage by the aid of which their thinking was done; for science\nand philosophy have had to make a serviceable terminology by dint\nof long and arduous trial and practice, and linguistic processes\nfit for expressing general or abstract notions accurately grew up\nonly through numberless failures and at the expense of much\ninaccurate thinking and loose talking. As in most of nature’s\nprocesses, there was a great waste of energy before a good result\ncould be secured. Accordingly primitive men were very wide of the\nmark in their views of nature. To them the world was a sort of\nenchanted ground, peopled with sprites and goblins; the quaint\nnotions with which we now amuse our children in fairy tales\nrepresent a style of thinking which once was current among grown\nmen and women, and which is still current wherever men remain in\na savage condition. The theories of the world wrought out by\nearly priest-philosophers were in great part made up of such\ngrotesque notions; and having become variously implicated with\nethical opinions as to the nature and consequences of right and\nwrong behaviour, they acquired a kind of sanctity, so that any\nthinker who in the light of a wider experience ventured to alter\nor amend the primitive theory was likely to be vituperated as an\nirreligious man or atheist. This sort of inference has not yet\nbeen wholly abandoned, even in civilized communities. Even to-day\nbooks are written about “the conflict between religion and\nscience,” and other books are written with intent to reconcile\nthe two presumed antagonists. But when we look beneath the\nsurface of things, we see that in reality there has never been\nany conflict between religion and science, nor is any\nreconciliation called for where harmony has always existed. The\nreal historical conflict, which has been thus curiously misnamed,\nhas been the conflict between the more-crude opinions belonging\nto the science of an earlier age and the less-crude opinions\nbelonging to the science of a later age. In the course of this\ncontest the more-crude opinions have usually been defended in the\nname of religion, and the less-crude opinions have invariably won\nthe victory; but religion itself, which is not concerned with\nopinion, but with the aspiration which leads us to strive after a\npurer and holier life, has seldom or never been attacked. On the\ncontrary, the scientific men who have conducted the battle on\nbehalf of the less-crude opinions have generally been influenced\nby this religious aspiration quite as strongly as the apologists\nof the more-crude opinions, and so far from religious feeling\nhaving been weakened by their perennial series of victories, it\nhas apparently been growing deeper and stronger all the time. The\nreligious sense is as yet too feebly developed in most of us; but\ncertainly in no preceding age have men taken up the work of life\nwith more earnestness or with more real faith in the unseen than\nat the present day, when so much of what was once deemed\nall-important knowledge has been consigned to the limbo of\nmythology.",
        "The more-crude theories of early times are to be chiefly\ndistinguished from the less-crude theories of to-day as being\nlargely the products of random guesswork. Hypothesis, or\nguesswork, indeed, lies at the foundation of all scientific\nknowledge. The riddle of the universe, like less important\nriddles, is unravelled only by approximative trials, and the most\nbrilliant discoverers have usually been the bravest guessers.\nKepler’s laws were the result of indefatigable guessing, and so,\nin a somewhat different sense, was the wave-theory of light. But\nthe guesswork of scientific inquirers is very different now from\nwhat it was in older times. In the first place, we have slowly\nlearned that a guess must be verified before it can be accepted\nas a sound theory; and, secondly, so many truths have been\nestablished beyond contravention, that the latitude for\nhypothesis is much less than it once was. Nine tenths of the\nguesses which might have occurred to a mediaeval philosopher\nwould now be ruled out as inadmissible, because they would not\nharmonize with the knowledge which has been acquired since the\nMiddle Ages. There is one direction especially in which this\ncontinuous limitation of guesswork by ever-accumulating\nexperience has manifested itself. From first to last, all our\nspeculative successes and failures have agreed in teaching us\nthat the most general principles of action which prevail to-day,\nand in our own corner of the universe, have always prevailed\nthroughout as much of the universe as is accessible to our\nresearch. They have taught us that for the deciphering of the\npast and the predicting of the future, no hypotheses are\nadmissible which are not based upon the actual behaviour of\nthings in the present. Once there was unlimited facility for\nguessing as to how the solar system might have come into\nexistence; now the origin of the sun and planets is adequately\nexplained when we have unfolded all that is implied in the\nprocesses which are still going on in the solar system. Formerly\nappeals were made to all manner of violent agencies to account\nfor the changes which the earth’s surface has undergone since our\nplanet began its independent career; now it is seen that the same\nslow working of rain and tide, of wind and wave and frost, of\nsecular contraction and of earthquake pulse, which is visible\nto-day, will account for the whole. It is not long since it was\nsupposed that a species of animals or plants could be swept away\nonly by some unusual catastrophe, while for the origination of\nnew species something called an act of “special creation” was\nnecessary; and as to the nature of such extraordinary events\nthere was endless room for guesswork; but the discovery of\nnatural selection was the discovery of a process, going on\nperpetually under our very eyes, which must inevitably of itself\nextinguish some species and bring new ones into being. In these\nand countless other ways we have learned that all the rich\nvariety of nature is pervaded by unity of action, such as we\nmight expect to find if nature is the manifestation of an\ninfinite God who is without variableness or shadow of turning,\nbut quite incompatible with the fitful behaviour of the\nanthropomorphic deities of the old mythologies. By thus\nabstaining from all appeal to agencies that are extra-cosmic, or\nnot involved in the orderly system of events that we see\noccurring around us, we have at last succeeded in eliminating\nfrom philosophic speculation the character of random guesswork\nwhich at first of necessity belonged to it. Modern scientific\nhypothesis is so far from being a haphazard mental proceeding\nthat it is perhaps hardly fair to classify it with guesses. It is\nlifted out of the plane of guesswork, in so far as it has\nacquired the character of inevitable inference from that which\nnow is to that which has been or will be. Instead of the\ninnumerable particular assumptions which were once admitted into\ncosmic philosophy, we are now reduced to the one universal\nassumption which has been variously described as the “principle\nof continuity,” the “uniformity of nature,” the “persistence of\nforce,” or the “law of causation,” and which has been variously\nexplained as a necessary datum for scientific thinking or as a\nnet result of all induction. I am not unwilling, however, to\nadopt the language of a book which has furnished the occasion for\nthe present discussion, and to say that this grand assumption is\na supreme act of faith, the definite expression of a trust that\nthe infinite Sustainer of the universe “will not put us to\npermanent intellectual confusion.” For in this mode of statement\nthe harmony between the scientific and the religious points of\nview is well brought out. It is as affording the only outlet from\npermanent intellectual confusion that inquirers have been driven\nto appeal to the principle of continuity; and it is by unswerving\nreliance upon this principle that we have obtained such insight\ninto the past, present, and future of the world as we now\npossess.",
        "The work just mentioned[1] is especially interesting as an\nattempt to bring the probable destiny of the human soul into\nconnection with the modern theories which explain the past and\nfuture career of the physical universe in accordance with the\nprinciple of continuity. Its authorship is as yet unknown, but it\nis believed to be the joint production of two of the most eminent\nphysicists in Great Britain, and certainly the accurate knowledge\nand the ingenuity and subtlety of thought displayed in it are\nsuch as to lend great probability to this conjecture. Some\naccount of the argument it contains may well precede the\nsuggestions presently to be set forth concerning the Unseen\nWorld; and we shall find it most convenient to begin, like our\nauthors, with a brief statement of what the principle of\ncontinuity teaches as to the proximate beginning and end of the\nvisible universe. I shall in the main set down only results,\nhaving elsewhere[2] given a simple exposition of the arguments\nupon which these results are founded.",

        "The first great cosmological speculation which has been raised\nquite above the plane of guesswork by making no other assumption\nthan that of the uniformity of nature, is the well-known Nebular\nHypothesis. Every astronomer knows that the earth, like all other\ncosmical bodies which are flattened at the poles, was formerly a\nmass of fluid, and consequently filled a much larger space than\nat present. It is further agreed, on all hands, that the sun is a\ncontracting body, since there is no other possible way of\naccounting for the enormous quantity of heat which he generates.\nThe so-called primeval nebula follows as a necessary inference\nfrom these facts. There was once a time when the earth was\ndistended on all sides away out to the moon and beyond it, so\nthat the matter now contained in the moon was then a part of our\nequatorial zone. And at a still remoter date in the past, the\nmass of the sun was diffused in every direction beyond the orbit\nof Neptune, and no planet had an individual existence, for all\nwere indistinguishable parts of the solar mass. When the great\nmass of the sun, increased by the relatively small mass of all\nthe planets put together, was spread out in this way, it was a\nrare vapour or gas. At the period where the question is taken up\nin Laplace’s treatment of the nebular theory, the shape of this\nmass is regarded as spheroidal; but at an earlier period its\nshape may well have been as irregular as that of any of the\nnebulae which we now see in distant parts of the heavens, for,\nwhatever its primitive shape, the equalization of its rotation\nwould in time make it spheroidal. That the QUANTITY of rotation\nwas the same then as now is unquestionable; for no system of\nparticles, great or small, can acquire or lose rotation by any\naction going on within itself, any more than a man could pick\nhimself up by his waistband and lift himself over a stone wale So\nthat the primitive rotating spheroidal solar nebula is not a\nmatter of assumption, but is just what must once have existed,\nprovided there has been no breach of continuity in nature’s\noperations. Now proceeding to reason back from the past to the\npresent, it has been shown that the abandonment of successive\nequatorial belts by the contracting solar mass must have ensued\nin accordance with known mechanical laws; and in similar wise,\nunder ordinary circumstances. each belt must have parted into\nfragments, and the fragments chasing each other around the same\norbit, must have at last coalesced into a spheroidal planet. Not\nonly this, but it has also been shown that as the result of such\na process the relative sizes of the planets would be likely to\ntake the order which they now follow; that the ring immediately\nsucceeding that of Jupiter would be likely to abort and produce a\ngreat number of tiny planets instead of one good-sized one; that\nthe outer planets would be likely to have many moons, and that\nSaturn, besides having the greatest number of moons, would be\nlikely to retain some of his inner rings unbroken; that the earth\nwould be likely to have a long day and Jupiter a short one; that\nthe extreme outer planets would be not unlikely to rotate in a\nretrograde direction; and so on, through a long list of\ninteresting and striking details. Not only, therefore, are we\ndriven to the inference that our solar system was once a vaporous\nnebula, but we find that the mere contraction of such a nebula,\nunder the influence of the enormous mutual gravitation of its\nparticles, carries with it the explanation of both the more\ngeneral and the more particular features of the present system.\nSo that we may fairly regard this stupendous process as veritable\nmatter of history, while we proceed to study it under some\nfurther aspects and to consider what consequences are likely to\nfollow.",
        "Our attention should first be directed to the enormous waste of\nenergy which has accompanied this contraction of the solar\nnebula. The first result of such a contraction is the generation\nof a great quantity of heat, and when the heat thus generated has\nbeen lost by radiation into surrounding space it becomes possible\nfor the contraction to continue. Thus, as concentration goes on,\nheat is incessantly generated and incessantly dissipated. How\nlong this process is to endure depends chiefly on the size of the\ncontracting mass, as small bodies radiate heat much faster than\nlarge ones. The moon seems to be already thoroughly refrigerated,\nwhile Jupiter and Saturn are very much hotter than the earth, as\nis shown by the tremendous atmospheric phenomena which occur on\ntheir surfaces. The sun, again, generates heat so rapidly, owing\nto his great energy of contraction, and loses it so slowly, owing\nto his great size, that his surface is always kept in a state of\nincandescence. His surface-temperature is estimated at some three\nmillion degrees of Fahrenheit, and a diminution of his diameter\nfar too small to be detected by the finest existing instruments\nwould suffice to maintain the present supply of heat for more\nthan fifty centuries. These facts point to a very long future\nduring which the sun will continue to warm the earth and its\ncompanion planets, but at the same time they carry on their face\nthe story of inevitable ultimate doom. If things continue to go\non as they have all along gone on, the sun must by and by grow\nblack and cold, and all life whatever throughout the solar system\nmust come to an end. Long before this consummation, however, life\nwill probably have become extinct through the refrigeration of\neach of the planets into a state like the present state of the\nmoon, in which the atmosphere and oceans have disappeared from\nthe surface. No doubt the sun will continue to give out heat a\nlong time after heat has ceased to be needed for the support of\nliving organisms. For the final refrigeration of the sun will\nlong be postponed by the fate of the planets themselves. The\nseparation of the planets from their parent solar mass seems to\nbe after all but a temporary separation. So nicely balanced are\nthey now in their orbits that they may well seem capable of\nrolling on in their present courses forever. But this is not the\ncase. Two sets of circumstances are all the while striving, the\none to drive the planets farther away from the sun, the other to\ndraw them all into it. On the one hand, every body in our system\nwhich contains fluid matter has tides raised upon its surface by\nthe attraction of neighbouring bodies. All the planets raise\ntides upon the surface of the sun and the periodicity of\nsun-spots (or solar cyclones) depends upon this fact. These tidal\nwaves act as a drag or brake upon the rotation of the sun,\nsomewhat diminishing its rapidity. But, in conformity with a\nprinciple of mechanics well known to astronomers, though not\nfamiliar to the general reader, all the motion of rotation thus\nlost by the sun is added to the planets in the shape of annual\nmotion of revolution, and thus their orbits all tend to\nenlarge,—they all tend to recede somewhat from the sun. But this\nstate of things, though long-enduring enough, is after all only\ntemporary, and will at any rate come to an end when the sun and\nplanets have become solid. Meanwhile another set of circumstances\nis all the time tending to bring the planets nearer to the sun,\nand in the long run must gain the mastery. The space through\nwhich the planets move is filled with a kind of matter which\nserves as a medium for the transmission of heat and light, and\nthis kind of matter, though different in some respects from\nordinary ponderable matter, is yet like it in exerting friction.\nThis friction is almost infinitely little, yet it has a wellnigh\ninfinite length of time to work in, and during all this wellnigh\ninfinite length of time it is slowly eating up the momentum of\nthe planets and diminishing their ability to maintain their\ndistances from the sun. Hence in course of time the planets will\nall fall into the sun, one after another, so that the solar\nsystem will end, as it began, by consisting of a single mass of\nmatter.",
        "But this is by no means the end of the story. When two bodies\nrush together, each parts with some of its energy of motion, and\nthis lost energy of motion reappears as heat. In the concussion\nof two cosmical bodies, like the sun and the earth, an enormous\nquantity of motion is thus converted into heat. Now heat, when\nnot allowed to radiate, or when generated faster than it can be\nradiated, is transformed into motion of expansion. Hence the\nshock of sun and planet would at once result in the vaporization\nof both bodies; and there can be no doubt that by the time the\nsun has absorbed the outermost of his attendant planets, he will\nhave resumed something like his original nebulous condition. He\nwill have been dilated into a huge mass of vapour, and will have\nbecome fit for a new process of contraction and for a new\nproduction of life-bearing planets.",
        "We are now, however, confronted by an interesting but difficult\nquestion. Throughout all this grand past and future career of the\nsolar system which we have just briefly traced, we have been\nwitnessing a most prodigal dissipation of energy in the shape of\nradiant heat. At the outset we had an enormous quantity of what\nis called “energy of position,” that is, the outer parts of our\nprimitive nebula had a very long distance through which to travel\ntowards one another in the slow process of concentration; and\nthis distance was the measure of the quantity of work possible to\nour system. As the particles of our nebula drew nearer and nearer\ntogether, the energy of position continually lost reappeared\ncontinually as heat, of which the greater part was radiated off,\nbut of which a certain amount was retained. All the gigantic\namount of work achieved in the geologic development of our earth\nand its companion planets, and in the development of life\nwherever life may exist in our system, has been the product of\nthis retained heat. At the present day the same wasteful process\nis going on. Each moment the sun’s particles are losing energy of\nposition as they draw closer and closer together, and the heat\ninto which this lost energy is metamorphosed is poured out most\nprodigally in every direction. Let us consider for a moment how\nlittle of it gets used in our system. The earth’s orbit is a\nnearly circular figure more than five hundred million miles in\ncircumference, while only eight thousand miles of this path are\nat any one time occupied by the earth’s mass. Through these eight\nthousand miles the sun’s radiated energy is doing work, but\nthrough the remainder of the five hundred million it is idle and\nwasted. But the case is far more striking when we reflect that it\nis not in the plane of the earth’s orbit only that the sun’s\nradiance is being poured out. It is not an affair of a circle,\nbut of a sphere. In order to utilize all the solar rays, we\nshould need to have an immense number of earths arranged so as to\ntouch each other, forming a hollow sphere around the sun, with\nthe present radius of the earth’s orbit. We may well believe\nProfessor Tyndall, therefore, when he tells us that all the solar\nradiance we receive is less than a two-billionth part of what is\nsent flying through the desert regions of space. Some of the\nimmense residue of course hits other planets stationed in the way\nof it, and is utilized upon their surfaces; but the planets, all\nput together, stop so little of the total quantity that our\nstartling illustration is not materially altered by taking them\ninto the account. Now this two-billionth part of the solar\nradiance poured out from moment to moment suffices to blow every\nwind, to raise every cloud, to drive every engine, to build up\nthe tissue of every plant, to sustain the activity of every\nanimal, including man, upon the surface of our vast and stately\nglobe. Considering the wondrous richness and variety of the\nterrestrial life wrought out by the few sunbeams which we catch\nin our career through space, we may well pause overwhelmed and\nstupefied at the thought of the incalculable possibilities of\nexistence which are thrown away with the potent actinism that\ndarts unceasingly into the unfathomed abysms of immensity. Where\nit goes to or what becomes of it, no one of us can surmise.",
        "Now when, in the remote future, our sun is reduced to vapour by\nthe impact of the several planets upon his surface, the resulting\nnebulous mass must be a very insignificant affair compared with\nthe nebulous mass with which we started. In order to make a\nsecond nebula equal in size and potential energy to the first\none, all the energy of position at first existing should have\nbeen retained in some form or other. But nearly all of it has\nbeen lost, and only an insignificant fraction remains with which\nto endow a new system. In order to reproduce, in future ages,\nanything like that cosmical development which is now going on in\nthe solar system, aid must be sought from without. We must\nendeavour to frame some valid hypothesis as to the relation of\nour solar system to other systems.",
        "Thus far our view has been confined to the career of a single\nstar,—our sun,—with the tiny, easily-cooling balls which it has\ncast off in the course of its development. Thus far, too, our\ninferences have been very secure, for we have been dealing with a\ncircumscribed group of phenomena, the beginning and end of which\nhave been brought pretty well within the compass of our\nimagination. It is quite another thing to deal with the actual or\nprobable career of the stars in general, inasmuch as we do not\neven know how many stars there are, which form parts of a common\nsystem, or what. are their precise dynamic relations to one\nanother. Nevertheless we have knowledge of a few facts which may\nsupport some cautious inferences. All the stars which we can see\nare undoubtedly bound together by relations of gravitation. No\ndoubt our sun attracts all the other stars within our ken, and is\nreciprocally attracted by them. The stars, too, lie mostly in or\naround one great plane, as is the case with the members of the\nsolar system. Moreover, the stars are shown by the spectroscope\nto consist of chemical elements identical with those which are\nfound in the solar system. Such facts as these make it probable\nthat the career of other stars, when adequately inquired into,\nwould be found to be like that of our own sun. Observation daily\nenhances this probability, for our study of the sidereal universe\nis continually showing us stars in all stages of development. We\nfind irregular nebulae, for example; we find spiral and\nspheroidal nebulae; we find stars which have got beyond the\nnebulous stage, but are still at a whiter heat than our sun; and\nwe also find many stars which yield the same sort of spectrum as\nour sun. The inference seems forced upon us that the same process\nof concentration which has gone on in the case of our solar\nnebula has been going on in the case of other nebulae. The\nhistory of the sun is but a type of the history of stars in\ngeneral. And when we consider that all other visible stars and\nnebulae are cooling and contracting bodies, like our sun, to what\nother conclusion could we very well come? When we look at Sirius,\nfor instance, we do not see him surrounded by planets, for at\nsuch a distance no planet could be visible, even Sirius himself,\nthough fourteen times larger than our sun, appearing only as a\n\"twinkling little star.” But a comparative survey of the heavens\nassures us that Sirius can hardly have arrived at his present\nstage of concentration without detaching, planet-forming rings,\nfor there is no reason for supposing that mechanical laws out\nthere are at all different from what they are in our own system.\nAnd the same kind of inference must apply to all the matured\nstars which we see in the heavens.",
        "When we duly take all these things into the account, the case of\nour solar system will appear as only one of a thousand cases of\nevolution and dissolution with which the heavens furnish us.\nOther stars, like our sun, have undoubtedly started as vaporous\nmasses, and have thrown off planets in contracting. The inference\nmay seem a bold one, but it after all involves no other\nassumption than that of the continuity of natural phenomena. It\nis not likely, therefore, that the solar system will forever be\nleft to itself. Stars which strongly gravitate toward each other,\nwhile moving through a perennially resisting medium, must in time\nbe drawn together. The collision of our extinct sun with one of\nthe Pleiades, after this manner, would very likely suffice to\ngenerate even a grander nebula than the one with which we\nstarted. Possibly the entire galactic system may, in an\ninconceivably remote future, remodel itself in this way; and\npossibly the nebula from which our own group of planets has been\nformed may have owed its origin to the disintegration of systems\nwhich had accomplished their career in the depths of the bygone\neternity.",
        "When the problem is extended to these huge dimensions, the\nprospect of an ultimate cessation of cosmical work is\nindefinitely postponed, but at the same time it becomes\nimpossible for us to deal very securely with the questions we\nhave raised. The magnitudes and periods we have introduced are so\nnearly infinite as to baffle speculation itself: One point,\nhowever, we seem dimly to discern. Supposing the stellar universe\nnot to be absolutely infinite in extent, we may hold that the day\nof doom, so often postponed, must come at last. The concentration\nof matter and dissipation of energy, so often checked, must in\nthe end prevail, so that, as the final outcome of things, the\nentire universe will be reduced to a single enormous ball, dead\nand frozen, solid and black, its potential energy of motion\nhaving been all transformed into heat and radiated away. Such a\nconclusion has been suggested by Sir William Thomson, and it is\nquite forcibly stated by the authors of “The Unseen Universe.\"\nThey remind us that “if there be any one form of energy less\nreadily or less completely transformable than the others, and if\ntransformations constantly go on, more and more of the whole\nenergy of the universe will inevitably sink into this lower grade\nas time advances.” Now radiant heat, as we have seen, is such a\nlower grade of energy. “At each transformation of heat-energy\ninto work, a large portion is degraded, while only a small\nportion is transformed into work. So that while it is very easy\nto change all of our mechanical or useful energy into heat, it is\nonly possible to transform a portion of this heat-energy back\nagain into work. After each change, too, the heat becomes more\nand more dissipated or degraded, and less and less available for\nany future transformation. In other words,” our authors continue,\n\"the tendency of heat is towards equalization; heat is par\nexcellence the communist of our universe, and it will no doubt\nultimately bring the system to an end. .... It is absolutely\ncertain that life, so far as it is physical, depends essentially\nupon transformations of energy; it is also absolutely certain\nthat age after age the possibility of such transformations is\nbecoming less and less; and, so far as we yet know, the final\nstate of the present universe must be an aggregation (into one\nmass) of all the matter it contains, i. e. the potential energy\ngone, and a practically useless state of kinetic energy, i. e.\nuniform temperature throughout that mass.” Thus our authors\nconclude that the visible universe began in time and will in time\ncome to an end; and they add that under the physical conditions\nof such a universe “immortality is impossible.”",
        "Concerning the latter inference we shall by and by have something\nto say. Meanwhile this whole speculation as to the final\ncessation of cosmical work seems to me—as it does to my friend,\nProfessor Clifford[3]—by no means trustworthy. The conditions of\nthe problem so far transcend our grasp that any such speculation\nmust remain an unverifiable guess. I do not go with Professor\nClifford in doubting whether the laws of mechanics are absolutely\nthe same throughout eternity; I cannot quite reconcile such a\ndoubt with faith in the principle of continuity. But it does seem\nto me needful, before we conclude that radiated energy is\nabsolutely and forever wasted, that we should find out what\nbecomes of it. What we call radiant heat is simply transverse\nwave-motion, propagated with enormous velocity through an ocean\nof subtle ethereal matter which bathes the atoms of all visible\nor palpable bodies and fills the whole of space, extending beyond\nthe remotest star which the telescope can reach. Whether there\nare any bounds at all to this ethereal ocean, or whether it is as\ninfinite as space itself, we cannot surmise. If it be limited,\nthe possible dispersion of radiant energy is limited by its\nextent. Heat and light cannot travel through emptiness. If the\nether is bounded by surrounding emptiness, then a ray of heat, on\narriving at this limiting emptiness, would be reflected back as\nsurely as a ball is sent back when thrown against a solid wall.\nIf this be the case, it will not affect our conclusions\nconcerning such a tiny region of space as is occupied by the\nsolar system, but it will seriously modify Sir William Thomson’s\nsuggestion as to the fate of the universe as a whole. The\nradiance thrown away by the sun is indeed lost so far as the\nfuture of our system is concerned, but not a single unit of it is\nlost from the universe. Sooner or later, reflected back in all\ndirections, it must do work in one quarter or another, so that\nultimate stagnation be comes impossible. It is true that no such\nreturn of radiant energy has been detected in our corner of the\nworld; but we have not yet so far disentangled all the\nforce-relations of the universe that we are entitled to regard\nsuch a return as impossible. This is one way of escape from the\nconsummation of things depicted by our authors. Another way of\nescape is equally available, if we suppose that while the ether\nis without bounds the stellar universe also extends to infinity.\nFor in this case the reproduction of nebulous masses fit for\ngenerating new systems of worlds must go on through space that is\nendless, and consequently the process can never come to an end\nand can never have had a beginning. We have, therefore, three\nalternatives: either the visible universe is finite, while the\nether is infinite; or both are finite; or both are infinite. Only\non the first supposition, I think, do we get a universe which\nbegan in time and must end in time. Between such stupendous\nalternatives we have no grounds for choosing. But it would seem\nthat the third, whether strictly true or not, best represents the\nstate of the case relatively to our feeble capacity of\ncomprehension. Whether absolutely infinite or not, the dimensions\nof the universe must be taken as practically infinite, so far as\nhuman thought is concerned. They immeasurably transcend the\ncapabilities of any gauge we can bring to bear on them.\nAccordingly all that we are really entitled to hold, as the\noutcome of sound speculation, is the conception of innumerable\nsystems of worlds concentrating out of nebulous masses, and then\nrushing together and dissolving into similar masses, as bubbles\nunite and break up—now here, now there—in their play on the\nsurface of a pool, and to this tremendous series of events we can\nassign neither a beginning nor an end.",
        "[3] Fortnightly Review, April, 1875.",
        "We must now make some more explicit mention of the ether which\ncarries through space the rays of heat and light. In closest\nconnection with the visible stellar universe, the vicissitudes of\nwhich we have briefly traced, the all-pervading ether constitutes\na sort of unseen world remarkable enough from any point of view,\nbut to which the theory of our authors ascribes capacities\nhitherto unsuspected by science. The very existence of an ocean\nof ether enveloping the molecules of material bodies has been\ndoubted or denied by many eminent physicists, though of course\nnone have called in question the necessity for some interstellar\nmedium for the transmission of thermal and luminous vibrations.\nThis scepticism has been, I think, partially justified by the\nmany difficulties encompassing the conception, into which,\nhowever, we need not here enter. That light and heat cannot be\nconveyed by any of the ordinary sensible forms of matter is\nunquestionable. None of the forms of sensible matter can be\nimagined sufficiently elastic to propagate wave-motion at the\nrate of one hundred and eighty-eight thousand miles per second.\nYet a ray of light is a series of waves, and implies some\nsubstance in which the waves occur. The substance required is one\nwhich seems to possess strangely contradictory properties. It is\ncommonly regarded as an “ether” or infinitely rare substance;\nbut, as Professor Jevons observes, we might as well regard it as\nan infinitely solid “adamant.” “Sir John Herschel has calculated\nthe amount of force which may be supposed, according to the\nundulatory theory of light, to be exerted at each point in space,\nand finds it to be 1,148,000,000,000 times the elastic force of\nordinary air at the earth’s surface, so that the pressure of the\nether upon a square inch of surface must be about\n17,000,000,000,000, or seventeen billions of pounds.\"[4] Yet at\nthe same time the resistance offered by the ether to the\nplanetary motions is too minute to be appreciable. “All our\nordinary notions,” says Professor Jevons, “must be laid aside in\ncontemplating such an hypothesis; yet [it is] no more than the\nobserved phenomena of light and heat force us to accept. We\ncannot deny even the strange suggestion of Dr. Young, that there\nmay be independent worlds, some possibly existing in different\nparts of space, but others perhaps pervading each other, unseen\nand unknown, in the same space. For if we are bound to admit the\nconception of this adamantine firmament, it is equally easy to\nadmit a plurality of such.”",
        "[4] Jevons’s Principles of Science, Vol. II. p. 145. The figures,\nwhich in the English system of numeration read as seventeen\nbillions, would in the American system read as seventeen\ntrillions.",
        "The ether, therefore, is unlike any of the forms of matter which\nwe can weigh and measure. In some respects it resembles a fluid,\nin some respects a solid. It is both hard and elastic to an\nalmost inconceivable degree. It fills all material bodies like a\nsea in which the atoms of the material bodies are as islands, and\nit occupies the whole of what we call empty space. It is so\nsensitive that a disturbance in any part of it causes a “tremour\nwhich is felt on the surface of countless worlds.” Our old\nexperiences of matter give us no account of any substance like\nthis; yet the undulatory theory of light obliges us to admit such\na substance, and that theory is as well established as the theory\nof gravitation. Obviously we have here an enlargement of our\nexperience of matter. The analysis of the phenomena of light and\nradiant heat has brought us into mental relations with matter in\na different state from any in which we previously knew it. For\nthe supposition that the ether may be something essentially\ndifferent from matter is contradicted by all the terms we have\nused in describing it. Strange and contradictory as its\nproperties may seem, are they any more strange than the\nproperties of a gas would seem if we were for the first time to\ndiscover a gas after heretofore knowing nothing but solids and\nliquids? I think not; and the conclusion implied by our authors\nseems to me eminently probable, that in the so-called ether we\nhave simply a state of matter more primitive than what we know as\nthe gaseous state. Indeed, the conceptions of matter now current,\nand inherited from barbarous ages, are likely enough to be crude\nin the extreme. It is not strange that the study of such subtle\nagencies as heat and light should oblige us to modify them; and\nit will not be strange if the study of electricity should entail\nstill further revision of our ideas.",
        "We are now brought to one of the profoundest speculations of\nmodern times, the vortex-atom theory of Helmholtz and Thomson, in\nwhich the evolution of ordinary matter from ether is plainly\nindicated. The reader first needs to know what vortex-motion is;\nand this has been so beautifully explained by Professor Clifford,\nthat I quote his description entire: “Imagine a ring of\nindia-rubber, made by joining together the ends of a cylindrical\npiece (like a lead-pencil before it is cut), to be put upon a\nround stick which it will just fit with a little stretching. Let\nthe stick be now pulled through the ring while the latter is kept\nin its place by being pulled the other way on the outside. The\nindia-rubber has then what is called vortex-motion. Before the\nends were joined together, while it was straight, it might have\nbeen made to turn around without changing position, by rolling it\nbetween the hands. Just the same motion of rotation it has on the\nstick, only that the ends are now joined together. All the inside\nsurface of the ring is going one way, namely, the way the stick\nis pulled; and all the outside is going the other way. Such a\nvortex-ring is made by the smoker who purses his lips into a\nround hole and sends out a puff of smoke. The outside of the ring\nis kept back by the friction of his lips while the inside is\ngoing forwards; thus a rotation is set up all round the\nsmoke-ring as it travels out into the air.” In these cases, and\nin others as we commonly find it, vortex-motion owes its origin\nto friction and is after a while brought to an end by friction.\nBut in 1858 the equations of motion of an incompressible\nfrictionless fluid were first successfully solved by Helmholtz,\nand among other things he proved that, though vortex-motion could\nnot be originated in such a fluid, yet supposing it once to\nexist, it would exist to all eternity and could not be diminished\nby any mechanical action whatever. A vortex-ring, for example, in\nsuch a fluid, would forever preserve its own rotation, and would\nthus forever retain its peculiar individuality, being, as it\nwere, marked off from its neighbour vortex-rings. Upon this\nmechanical truth Sir William Thomson based his wonderfully\nsuggestive theory of the constitution of matter. That which is\npermanent or indestructible in matter is the ultimate homogeneous\natom; and this is probably all that is permanent, since chemists\nnow almost unanimously hold that so-called elementary molecules\nare not really simple, but owe their sensible differences to the\nvarious groupings of an ultimate atom which is alike for all.\nRelatively to our powers of comprehension the atom endures\neternally; that is, it retains forever unalterable its definite\nmass and its definite rate of vibration. Now this is just what a\nvortex-ring would do in an incompressible frictionless fluid.\nThus the startling question is suggested, Why may not the\nultimate atoms of matter be vortex-rings forever existing in such\na frictionless fluid filling the whole of space? Such a\nhypothesis is not less brilliant than Huyghens’s conjectural\nidentification of light with undulatory motion; and it is\nmoreover a legitimate hypothesis, since it can be brought to the\ntest of verification. Sir William Thomson has shown that it\nexplains a great many of the physical properties of matter: it\nremains to be seen whether it can explain them all.",
        "Of course the ether which conveys thermal and luminous\nundulations is not the frictionless fluid postulated by Sir\nWilliam Thomson. The most conspicuous property of the ether is\nits enormous elasticity, a property which we should not find in a\nfrictionless fluid. “To account for such elasticity,” says\nProfessor Clifford (whose exposition of the subject is still more\nlucid than that of our authors), “it has to be supposed that even\nwhere there are no material molecules the universal fluid is full\nof vortex-motion, but that the vortices are smaller and more\nclosely packed than those of [ordinary] matter, forming\naltogether a more finely grained structure. So that the\ndifference between matter and ether is reduced to a mere\ndifference in the size and arrangement of the component\nvortex-rings. Now, whatever may turn out to be the ultimate\nnature of the ether and of molecules, we know that to some extent\nat least they obey the same dynamic laws, and that they act upon\none another in accordance with these laws. Until, therefore, it\nis absolutely disproved, it must remain the simplest and most\nprobable assumption that they are finally made of the same stuff,\nthat the material molecule is some kind of knot or coagulation of\nether.\"[5]",
        "[5] Fortnightly Review, June, 1875, p. 784.",
        "Another interesting consequence of Sir William Thomson’s pregnant\nhypothesis is that the absolute hardness which has been\nattributed to material atoms from the time of Lucretius downward\nmay be dispensed with. Somewhat in the same way that a loosely\nsuspended chain becomes rigid with rapid rotation, the hardness\nand elasticity of the vortex-atom are explained as due to the\nswift rotary motion of a soft and yielding fluid. So that the\nvortex-atom is really indivisible, not by reason of its hardness\nor solidity, but by reason of the indestructibleness of its\nmotion.",
        "Supposing, now, that we adopt provisionally the vortex\ntheory,—the great power of which is well shown by the\nconsideration just mentioned,—we must not forget that it is\nabsolutely essential to the indestructibleness of the material\natom that the universal fluid in which it has an existence as a\nvortex-ring should be entirely destitute of friction. Once admit\neven the most infinitesimal amount of friction, while retaining\nthe conception of vortex-motion in a universal fluid, and the\nwhole case is so far altered that the material atom can no longer\nbe regarded as absolutely indestructible, but only as\nindefinitely enduring. It may have been generated, in bygone\neternity, by a natural process of evolution, and in future\neternity may come to an end. Relatively to our powers of\ncomprehension the practical difference is perhaps not great.\nScientifically speaking, Helmholtz and Thomson are as well\nentitled to reason upon the assumption of a perfectly\nfrictionless fluid as geometers in general are entitled to assume\nperfect lines without breadth and perfect surfaces without\nthickness. Perfect lines and surfaces do not exist within the\nregion of our experience; yet the conclusions of geometry are\nnone the less true ideally, though in any particular concrete\ninstance they are only approximately realized. Just so with the\nconception of a frictionless fluid. So far as experience goes,\nsuch a thing has no more real existence than a line without\nbreadth; and hence an atomic theory based upon such an assumption\nmay be as true ideally as any of the theorems of Euclid, but it\ncan give only an approximatively true account of the actual\nuniverse. These considerations do not at all affect the\nscientific value of the theory; but they will modify the tenour\nof such transcendental inferences as may be drawn from it\nregarding, the probable origin and destiny of the universe.",
        "The conclusions reached in the first part of this paper, while we\nwere dealing only with gross visible matter, may have seemed bold\nenough; but they are far surpassed by the inference which our\nauthors draw from the vortex theory as they interpret it. Our\nauthors exhibit various reasons, more or less sound, for\nattributing to the primordial fluid some slight amount of\nfriction; and in support of this view they adduce Le Sage’s\nexplanation of gravitation as a differential result of pressure,\nand Struve’s theory of the partial absorption of light-rays by\nthe ether,—questions with which our present purpose does not\nrequire us to meddle. Apart from such questions it is every way\nprobable that the primary assumption of Helmholtz and Thomson is\nonly an approximation to the truth. But if we accredit the\nprimordial fluid with even an infinitesimal amount of friction,\nthen we are required to conceive of the visible universe as\ndeveloped from the invisible and as destined to return into the\ninvisible. The vortex-atom, produced by infinitesimal friction\noperating through wellnigh infinite time, is to be ultimately\nabolished by the agency which produced it. In the words of our\nauthors, “If the visible universe be developed from an invisible\nwhich is not a perfect fluid, then the argument deduced by Sir\nWilliam Thomson in favour of the eternity of ordinary matter\ndisappears, since this eternity depends upon the perfect fluidity\nof the invisible. In fine, if we suppose the material universe to\nbe composed of a series of vortex-rings developed from an\ninvisible universe which is not a perfect fluid, it will be\nephemeral, just as the smoke-ring which we develop from air, or\nthat which we develop from water, is ephemeral, the only\ndifference being in duration, these lasting only for a few\nseconds, and the others it may be for billions of years.” Thus,\nas our authors suppose that “the available energy of the visible\nuniverse will ultimately be appropriated by the invisible,” they\ngo on to imagine, “at least as a possibility, that the separate\nexistence of the visible universe will share the same fate, so\nthat we shall have no huge, useless, inert mass existing in after\nages to remind the passer-by of a form of energy and a species of\nmatter that is long since out of date and functionally effete.\nWhy should not the universe bury its dead out of sight?”",
        "In one respect perhaps no more stupendous subject of\ncontemplation than this has ever been offered to the mind of man.\nIn comparison with the length of time thus required to efface the\ntiny individual atom, the entire cosmical career of our solar\nsystem, or even that of the whole starry galaxy, shrinks into\nutter nothingness. Whether we shall adopt the conclusion\nsuggested must depend on the extent of our speculative audacity.\nWe have seen wherein its probability consists, but in reasoning\nupon such a scale we may fitly be cautious and modest in\naccepting inferences, and our authors, we may be sure, would be\nthe first to recommend such modesty and caution. Even at the\ndimensions to which our theorizing has here grown, we may for\ninstance discern the possible alternative of a simultaneous or\nrhythmically successive generation and destruction of\nvortex-atoms which would go far to modify the conclusion just\nsuggested. But here we must pause for a moment, reserving for a\nsecond paper the weightier thoughts as to futurity which our\nauthors have sought to enwrap in these sublime physical\nspeculations.",
        "UP to this point, however remote from ordinary every-day thoughts\nmay be the region of speculation which we have been called upon\nto traverse, we have still kept within the limits of legitimate\nscientific hypothesis. Though we have ventured for a goodly\ndistance into the unknown, we have not yet been required to\nabandon our base of operations in the known. Of the views\npresented in the preceding paper, some are wellnigh certainly\nestablished, some are probable, some have a sort of plausibility,\nothers—to which we have refrained from giving assent—may\npossibly be true; but none are irretrievably beyond the\njurisdiction of scientific tests. No suggestion has so far been\nbroached which a very little further increase of our scientific\nknowledge may not show to be either eminently probable or\neminently improbable. We have kept pretty clear of mere\nsubjective guesses, such as men may wrangle about forever without\ncoming to any conclusion. The theory of the nebular origin of our\nplanetary system has come to command the assent of all persons\nqualified to appreciate the evidence on which it is based; and\nthe more immediate conclusions which we have drawn from that\ntheory are only such as are commonly drawn by astronomers and\nphysicists. The doctrine of an intermolecular and interstellar\nether is wrapped up in the well-established undulatory theory of\nlight. Such is by no means the case with Sir William Thomson’s\nvortex-atom theory, which to-day is in somewhat the same\ncondition as the undulatory theory of Huyghens two centuries ago.\nThis, however, is none the less a hypothesis truly scientific in\nconception, and in the speculations to which it leads us we are\nstill sure of dealing with views that admit at least of definite\nexpression and treatment. In other words, though our study of the\nvisible universe has led us to the recognition of a kind of\nunseen world underlying the world of things that are seen, yet\nconcerning the economy of this unseen world we have not been led\nto entertain any hypothesis that has not its possible\njustification in our experiences of visible phenomena.",
        "We are now called upon, following in the wake of our esteemed\nauthors, to venture on a different sort of exploration, in which\nwe must cut loose altogether from our moorings in the world of\nwhich we have definite experience. We are invited to entertain\nsuggestions concerning the peculiar economy of the invisible\nportion of the universe which we have no means of subjecting to\nany sort of test of probability, either experimental or\ndeductive. These suggestions are, therefore, not to be regarded\nas properly scientific; but, with this word of caution, we may\nproceed to show what they are.",
        "Compared with the life and death of cosmical systems which we\nhave heretofore contemplated, the life and death of individuals\nof the human race may perhaps seem a small matter; yet because we\nare ourselves the men who live and die, the small event is of\nvastly greater interest to us than the grand series of events of\nwhich it is part and parcel. It is natural that we should be more\ninterested in the ultimate fate of humanity than in the fate of a\nworld which is of no account to us save as our present\ndwelling-place. Whether the human soul is to come to an end or\nnot is to us a more important question than whether the visible\nuniverse, with its matter and energy, is to be absorbed in an\ninvisible ether. It is indeed only because we are interested in\nthe former question that we are so curious about the latter. If\nwe could dissociate ourselves from the material universe, our\nhabitat, we should probably speculate much less about its past\nand future. We care very little what becomes of the black ball of\nthe earth, after all life has vanished from its surface; or, if\nwe care at all about it, it is only because our thoughts about\nthe career of the earth are necessarily mixed up with our\nthoughts about life. Hence in considering the probable ultimate\ndestiny of the physical universe, our innermost purpose must be\nto know what is to become of all this rich and wonderful life of\nwhich the physical universe is the theatre. Has it all been\ndeveloped, apparently at almost infinite waste of effort, only to\nbe abolished again before it has attained to completeness, or\ndoes it contain or shelter some indestructible element which\nhaving drawn sustenance for a while from the senseless turmoil of\nphysical phenomena shall still survive their final decay? This\nquestion is closely connected with the time-honoured question of\nthe meaning, purpose, or tendency of the world. In the career of\nthe world is life an end, or a means toward an end, or only an\nincidental phenomenon in which we can discover no meaning?\nContemporary theologians seem generally to believe that one\nnecessary result of modern scientific inquiry must be the\ndestruction of the belief in immortal life, since against every\nthoroughgoing expounder of scientific knowledge they seek to hurl\nthe charge of “materialism.” Their doubts, however, are not\nshared by our authors, thorough men of science as they are,\nthough their mode of dealing with the question may not be such as\nwe can well adopt. While upholding the doctrine of evolution, and\nall the so-called “materialistic” views of modern science, they\nnot only regard the hypothesis of a future life as admissible,\nbut they even go so far as to propound a physical theory as to\nthe nature of existence after death. Let us see what this\nphysical theory is.",
        "As far as the visible universe is concerned, we do not find in it\nany evidence of immortality or of permanence of any sort, unless\nit be in the sum of potential and kinetic energies on the\npersistency of which depends our principle of continuity. In\nordinary language “the stars in their courses” serve as symbols\nof permanence, yet we have found reason to regard them as but\ntemporary phenomena. So, in the language of our authors, “if we\ntake the individual man, we find that he lives his short tale of\nyears, and that then the visible machinery which connects him\nwith the past, as well as that which enables him to act in the\npresent, falls into ruin and is brought to an end. If any germ or\npotentiality remains, it is certainly not connected with the\nvisible order of things.” In like manner our race is pretty sure\nto come to an end long before the destruction of the planet from\nwhich it now gets its sustenance. And in our authors opinion even\nthe universe will by and by become “old and effete, no less truly\nthan the individual: it is a glorious garment this visible\nuniverse, but not an immortal one; we must look elsewhere if we\nare to be clothed with immortality as with a garment.”",
        "It is at this point that our authors call attention to “the\napparently wasteful character of the arrangements of the visible\nuniverse.” The fact is one which we have already sufficiently\ndescribed, but we shall do well to quote the words in which our\nauthors recur to it: “All but a very small portion of the sun’s\nheat goes day by day into what we call empty space, and it is\nonly this very small remainder that is made use of by the various\nplanets for purposes of their own. Can anything be more\nperplexing than this seemingly frightful expenditure of the very\nlife and essence of the system? That this vast store of\nhigh-class energy should be doing nothing but travelling outwards\nin space at the rate of 188,000 miles per second is hardly\nconceivable, especially when the result of it is the inevitable\ndestruction of the visible universe.”",
        "Pursuing this teleological argument, it is suggested that perhaps\nthis apparent waste of energy is “only an arrangement in virtue\nof which our universe keeps up a memory of the past at the\nexpense of the present, inasmuch as all memory consists in an\ninvestiture of present resources in order to keep a hold upon the\npast.” Recourse is had to the ingenious argument in which Mr.\nBabbage showed that “if we had power to follow and detect the\nminutest effects of any disturbance, each particle of existing\nmatter must be a register of all that has happened. The track of\nevery canoe, of every vessel that has yet disturbed the surface\nof the ocean, whether impelled by manual force or elemental\npower, remains forever registered in the future movement of all\nsucceeding particles which may occupy its place. The furrow which\nis left is, indeed, instantly filled up by the closing waters;\nbut they draw after them other and larger portions of the\nsurrounding element, and these again, once moved, communicate\nmotion to others in endless succession.” In like manner, “the air\nitself is one vast library, on whose pages are forever written\nall that man has ever said or even whispered. There in their\nmutable but unerring characters, mixed with the earliest as well\nas the latest sighs of mortality, stand forever recorded vows\nunredeemed, promises unfulfilled, perpetuating in the united\nmovements of each particle the testimony of man’s changeful\nwill.\"[6] In some such way as this, records of every movement\nthat takes place in the world are each moment transmitted, with\nthe speed of light, through the invisible ocean of ether with\nwhich the world is surrounded. Even the molecular displacements\nwhich occur in our brains when we feel and think are thus\npropagated in their effects into the unseen world. The world of\nether is thus regarded by our authors as in some sort the obverse\nor complement of the world of sensible matter, so that whatever\nenergy is dissipated in the one is by the same act accumulated in\nthe other. It is like the negative plate in photography, where\nlight answers to shadow and shadow to light. Or, still better, it\nis like the case of an equation in which whatever quantity you\ntake from one side is added to the other with a contrary sign,\nwhile the relation of equality remains undisturbed. Thus, it will\nbe noticed, from the ingenious and subtle, but quite defensible\nsuggestion of Mr. Babbage, a leap is made to an assumption which\ncannot be defended scientifically, but only teleologically. It is\none thing to say that every movement in the visible world\ntransmits a record of itself to the surrounding ether, in such a\nway that from the undulation of the ether a sufficiently powerful\nintelligence might infer the character of the generating movement\nin the visible world. It is quite another thing to say that the\nether is organized in such a complex and delicate way as to be\nlike a negative image or counterpart of the world of sensible\nmatter. The latter view is no doubt ingenious, but it is\ngratuitous. It is sustained not by scientific analogy, but by the\ndesire to find some assignable use for the energy which is\nconstantly escaping from visible matter into invisible ether. The\nmoment we ask how do we know that this energy is not really\nwasted, or that it is not put to some use wholly undiscoverable\nby human intelligence, this assumption of an organized ether is\nat once seen to be groundless. It belongs not to the region of\nscience, but to that of pure mythology.",
        "[6] Babbage, Ninth Bridgewater Treatise, p. 115; Jevons,\nPrinciples of Science, Vol. II. p. 455.",
        "In justice to our authors, however, it should be remembered that\nthis assumption is put forth not as something scientifically\nprobable, but as something which for aught we know to the\ncontrary may possibly be true. This, to be sure, we need not\ndeny; nor if we once allow this prodigious leap of inference,\nshall we find much difficulty in reaching the famous conclusion\nthat “thought conceived to affect the matter of another universe\nsimultaneously with this may explain a future state.” This\nproposition, quaintly couched in an anagram, like the discoveries\nof old astronomers, was published last year in “Nature,” as\ncontaining the gist of the forthcoming book. On the\nnegative-image hypothesis it is not hard to see how thought is\nconceived to affect the seen and the unseen worlds\nsimultaneously. Every act of consciousness is accompanied by\nmolecular displacements in the brain, and these are of course\nresponded to by movements in the ethereal world. Thus as a series\nof conscious states build up a continuous memory in strict\naccordance with physical laws of motion,[7] so a correlative\nmemory is simultaneously built up in the ethereal world out of\nthe ethereal correlatives of the molecular displacements which go\non in our brains. And as there is a continual transfer of energy\nfrom the visible world to the ether, the extinction of vital\nenergy which we call death must coincide in some way with the\nawakening of vital energy in the correlative world; so that the\ndarkening of consciousness here is coincident with its dawning\nthere. In this way death is for the individual but a transfer\nfrom one physical state of existence to another; and so, on the\nlargest scale, the death or final loss of energy by the whole\nvisible universe has its counterpart in the acquirement of a\nmaximum of life by the correlative unseen world.",
        "There seems to be a certain sort of rigorous logical consistency\nin this daring speculation; but really the propositions of which\nit consists are so far from answering to anything within the\ndomain of human experience that we are unable to tell whether any\none of them logically follows from its predecessor or not. It is\nevident that we are quite out of the region of scientific tests,\nand to whatever view our authors may urge we can only languidly\nassent that it is out of our power to disprove it.",
        "[7] See my Outlines of Cosmic Philosophy, Vol. II. pp. 142-148.",
        "The essential weakness of such a theory as this lies in the fact\nthat it is thoroughly materialistic in character. It is currently\nassumed that the doctrine of a life after death cannot be\ndefended on materialistic grounds, but this is altogether too\nhasty an assumption. Our authors, indeed, are not philosophical\nmaterialists, like Dr. Priestley,—who nevertheless believed in a\nfuture life,—but one of the primary doctrines of materialism\nlies at the bottom of their argument. Materialism holds for one\nthing that consciousness is a product of a peculiar organization\nof matter, and for another thing that consciousness cannot\nsurvive the disorganization of the material body with which it is\nassociated. As held by philosophical materialists, like Buchner\nand Moleschott, these two opinions are strictly consistent with\neach other; nay, the latter seems to be the inevitable inference\nfrom the former, though Priestley did not so regard it. Now our\nauthors very properly refuse to commit themselves to the opinion\nthat mind is the product of matter, but their argument\nnevertheless implies that some sort of material vehicle is\nnecessary for the continuance of mind in a future state of\nexistence. This material vehicle they seek to supply in the\ntheory which connects by invisible bonds of transmitted energy\nthe perishable material body with its counterpart in the world of\nether. The materialism of the argument is indeed partly veiled by\nthe terminology in which this counterpart is called a “spiritual\nbody,” but in this novel use or abuse of scriptural language\nthere seems to me to be a strange confusion of ideas. Bear in\nmind that the “invisible universe” into which energy is\nconstantly passing is simply the luminiferous ether, which our\nauthors, to suit the requirements of their hypothesis, have\ngratuitously endowed with a complexity and variety of structure\nanalogous to that of the visible world of matter. Their language\nis not always quite so precise as one could desire, for while\nthey sometimes speak of the ether itself as the “unseen\nuniverse,” they sometimes allude to a primordial medium yet\nsubtler in constitution and presumably more immaterial. Herein\nlies the confusion. Why should the luminiferous ether, or any\nprimordial medium in which it may have been generated, be\nregarded as in any way “spiritual”? Great physicists, like less\ntrained thinkers, are sometimes liable to be unconsciously\ninfluenced by old associations of ideas which, ostensibly\nrepudiated, still lurk under cover of the words we use. I fear\nthat the old associations which led the ancients to describe the\nsoul as a breath or a shadow, and which account for the\netymologies of such words as “ghost” and “spirit,” have had\nsomething to do with this spiritualization of the interstellar\nether. Some share may also have been contributed by the Platonic\nnotion of the “grossness” or “bruteness” of tangible matter,—a\nnotion which has survived in Christian theology, and which\neducated men of the present day have by no means universally\noutgrown. Save for some such old associations as these, why\nshould it be supposed that matter becomes “spriritualized” as it\ndiminishes in apparent substantiality? Why should matter be\npronounced respectable in the inverse ratio of its density or\nponderability? Why is a diamond any more chargeable with\n\"grossness” than a cubic centimetre of hydrogen? Obviously such\nfancies are purely of mythologic parentage. Now the luminiferous\nether, upon which our authors make such extensive demands, may be\nphysically “ethereal” enough, in spite of the enormous elasticity\nwhich leads Professor Jevons to characterize it as “adamantine\";\nbut most assuredly we have not the slightest reason for speaking\nof it as “immaterial” or “spiritual.” Though we are unable to\nweigh it in the balance, we at least know it as a transmitter of\nundulatory movements, the size and shape of which we can\naccurately measure. Its force-relations with ponderable matter\nare not only universally and incessantly maintained, but they\nhave that precisely quantitative character which implies an\nessential identity between the innermost natures of the two\nsubstances. We have seen reason for thinking it probable that\nether and ordinary matter are alike composed of vortex-rings in a\nquasi-frictionless fluid; but whatever be the fate of this subtle\nhypothesis, we may be sure that no theory will ever be\nentertained in which the analysis of ether shall require\ndifferent symbols from that of ordinary matter. In our authors’\ntheory, therefore, the putting on of immortality is in no wise\nthe passage from a material to a spiritual state. It is the\npassage from one kind of materially conditioned state to another.\nThe theory thus appeals directly to our experiences of the\nbehaviour of matter; and in deriving so little support as it does\nfrom these experiences, it remains an essentially weak\nspeculation, whatever we may think of its ingenuity. For so long\nas we are asked to accept conclusions drawn from our experiences\nof the material world, we are justified in demanding something\nmore than mere unconditioned possibility. We require some\npositive evidence, be it ever so little in amount; and no theory\nwhich cannot furnish such positive evidence is likely to carry to\nour minds much practical conviction.",
        "This is what I meant by saying that the great weakness of the\nhypothesis here criticized lies in its materialistic character.\nIn contrast with this we shall presently see that the assertion\nof a future life which is not materially conditioned, though\nunsupported by any item of experience whatever, may nevertheless\nbe an impregnable assertion. But first I would conclude the\nforegoing criticism by ruling out altogether the sense in which\nour authors use the expression “Unseen Universe.” Scientific\ninference, however remote, is connected by such insensible\ngradations with ordinary perception, that one may well question\nthe propriety of applying the term “unseen” to that which is\npresented to “the mind’s eye” as inevitable matter of inference.\nIt is true that we cannot see the ocean of ether in which visible\nmatter floats; but there are many other invisible things which\nyet we do not regard as part of the “unseen world.” I do not see\nthe air which I am now breathing within the four walls of my\nstudy, yet its existence is sufficiently a matter of\nsense-perception as it fills my lungs and fans my cheek. The\natoms which compose a drop of water are not only invisible, but\ncannot in any way be made the objects of sense-perception; yet by\nproper inferences from their behaviour we can single them out for\nmeasurement, so that Sir William Thomson can tell us that if the\ndrop of water were magnified to the size of the earth, the\nconstituent atoms would be larger than peas, but not so large as\nbilliard-balls. If we do not see such atoms with our eyes, we\nhave one adequate reason in their tiny dimensions, though there\nare further reasons than this. It would be hard to say why the\nluminiferous ether should be relegated to the “unseen world” any\nmore than the material atom. Whatever we know as possessing\nresistance and extension, whatever we can subject to mathematical\nprocesses of measurement, we also conceive as existing in such\nshape that, with appropriate eyes and under proper visual\nconditions, we MIGHT see it, and we are not entitled to draw any\nline of demarcation between such an object of inference and\nothers which may be made objects of sense-perception. To set\napart the ether as constituting an “unseen universe” is therefore\nillegitimate and confusing. It introduces a distinction where\nthere is none, and obscures the fact that both invisible ether\nand visible matter form but one grand universe in which the sum\nof energy remains constant, though the order of its distribution\nendlessly varies.",
        "Very different would be the logical position of a theory which\nshould assume the existence of an “Unseen World” entirely\nspiritual in constitution, and in which material conditions like\nthose of the visible world should have neither place nor meaning.\nSuch a world would not consist of ethers or gases or ghosts, but\nof purely psychical relations akin to such as constitute thoughts\nand feelings when our minds are least solicited by\nsense-perceptions. In thus marking off the “Unseen World” from\nthe objective universe of which we have knowledge, our line of\ndemarcation would at least be drawn in the right place. The\ndistinction between psychical and material phenomena is a\ndistinction of a different order from all other distinctions\nknown to philosophy, and it immeasurably transcends all others.\nThe progress of modern discovery has in no respect weakened the\nforce of Descartes’s remark, that between that of which the\ndifferential attribute is Thought and that of which the\ndifferential attribute is Extension, there can be no similarity,\nno community of nature whatever. By no scientific cunning of\nexperiment or deduction can Thought be weighed or measured or in\nany way assimilated to such things as may be made the actual or\npossible objects of sense-perception. Modern discovery, so far\nfrom bridging over the chasm between Mind and Matter, tends\nrather to exhibit the distinction between them as absolute. It\nhas, indeed, been rendered highly probable that every act of\nconsciousness is accompanied by a molecular motion in the cells\nand fibres of the brain; and materialists have found great\ncomfort in this fact, while theologians and persons of little\nfaith have been very much frightened by it. But since no one ever\npretended that thought can go on, under the conditions of the\npresent life, without a brain, one finds it rather hard to\nsympathize either with the self-congratulations of Dr. Buchner’s\ndisciples[8] or with the terrors of their opponents. But what has\nbeen less commonly remarked is the fact that when the thought and\nthe molecular movement thus occur simultaneously, in no\nscientific sense is the thought the product of the molecular\nmovement. The sun-derived energy of motion latent in the food we\neat is variously transformed within the organism, until some of\nit appears as the motion of the molecules of a little globule of\nnerve-matter in the brain. In a rough way we might thus say that\nthe chemical energy of the food indirectly produces the motion of\nthese little nerve-molecules. But does this motion of\nnerve-molecules now produce a thought or state of consciousness?\nBy no means. It simply produces some other motion of\nnerve-molecules, and this in turn produces motion of contraction\nor expansion in some muscle, or becomes transformed into the\nchemical energy of some secreting gland. At no point in the whole\ncircuit does a unit of motion disappear as motion to reappear as\na unit of consciousness. The physical process is complete in\nitself, and the thought does not enter into it. All that we can\nsay is, that the occurrence of the thought is simultaneous with\nthat part of the physical process which consists of a molecular\nmovement in the brain.[9] To be sure, the thought is always there\nwhen summoned, but it stands outside the dynamic circuit, as\nsomething utterly alien from and incomparable with the events\nwhich summon it. No doubt, as Professor Tyndall observes, if we\nknew exhaustively the physical state of the brain, “the\ncorresponding thought or feeling might be inferred; or, given the\nthought or feeling, the corresponding state of the brain might be\ninferred. But how inferred? It would be at bottom not a case of\nlogical inference at all, but of empirical association. You may\nreply that many of the inferences of science are of this\ncharacter; the inference, for example, that an electric current\nof a given direction will deflect a magnetic needle in a definite\nway; but the cases differ in this, that the passage from the\ncurrent to the needle, if not demonstrable, is thinkable, and\nthat we entertain no doubt as to the final mechanical solution of\nthe problem. But the passage from the physics of the brain to the\ncorresponding facts of consciousness is unthinkable. Granted that\na definite thought and a definite molecular action in the brain\noccur simultaneously; we do not possess the intellectual organ,\nnor apparently any rudiment of the organ, which would enable us\nto pass by a process of reasoning from the one to the other. They\nappear together, but we do not know why.\"[10]",

        "An unseen world consisting of purely psychical or spiritual\nphenomena would accordingly be demarcated by an absolute gulf\nfrom what we call the material universe, but would not\nnecessarily be discontinuous with the psychical phenomena which\nwe find manifested in connection with the world of matter. The\ntransfer of matter, or physical energy, or anything else that is\nquantitatively measurable, into such an unseen world, may be set\ndown as impossible, by reason of the very definition of such a\nworld. Any hypothesis which should assume such a transfer would\ninvolve a contradiction in terms. But the hypothesis of a\nsurvival of present psychical phenomena in such a world, after\nbeing denuded of material conditions, is not in itself absurd or\nself-contradictory, though it may be impossible to support it by\nany arguments drawn from the domain of human experience. Such is\nthe shape which it seems to me that, in the present state of\nphilosophy, the hypothesis of a future life must assume. We have\nnothing to say to gross materialistic notions of ghosts and\nbogies, and spirits that upset tables and whisper to ignorant\nvulgar women the wonderful information that you once had an aunt\nSusan. The unseen world imagined in our hypothesis is not\nconnected with the present material universe by any such\n\"invisible bonds” as would allow Bacon and Addison to come to\nBoston and write the silliest twaddle in the most ungrammatical\nEnglish before a roomful of people who have never learned how to\ntest what they are pleased to call the “evidence of their\nsenses.” Our hypothesis is expressly framed so as to exclude all\nintercourse whatever between the unseen world of spirit\nunconditioned by matter and the present world of spirit\nconditioned by matter in which all our experiences have been\ngathered. The hypothesis being framed in such a way, the question\nis, What has philosophy to say to it? Can we, by searching our\nexperiences, find any reason for adopting such an hypothesis? Or,\non the other hand, supposing we can find no such reason, would\nthe total failure of experimental evidence justify us in\nrejecting it?",
        "The question is so important that I will restate it. I have\nimagined a world made up of psychical phenomena, freed from the\nmaterial conditions under which alone we know such phenomena. Can\nwe adduce any proof of the possibility of such a world? Or if we\ncannot, does our failure raise the slightest presumption that\nsuch a world is impossible?",
        "The reply to the first clause of the question is sufficiently\nobvious. We have no experience whatever of psychical phenomena\nsave as manifested in connection with material phenomena. We know\nof Mind only as a group of activities which are never exhibited\nto us except through the medium of motions of matter. In all our\nexperience we have never encountered such activities save in\nconnection with certain very complicated groupings of highly\nmobile material particles into aggregates which we call living\norganisms. And we have never found them manifested to a very\nconspicuous extent save in connection with some of those\nspecially organized aggregates which have vertebrate skeletons\nand mammary glands. Nay, more, when we survey the net results of\nour experience up to the present time, we find indisputable\nevidence that in the past history of the visible universe\npsychical phenomena have only begun to be manifested in\nconnection with certain complex aggregates of material phenomena.\nAs these material aggregates have age by age become more complex\nin structure, more complex psychical phenomena have been\nexhibited. The development of Mind has from the outset been\nassociated with the development of Matter. And to-day, though\nnone of us has any knowledge of the end of psychical phenomena in\nhis own case, yet from all the marks by which we recognize such\nphenomena in our fellow-creatures, whether brute or human, we are\ntaught that when certain material processes have been gradually\nor suddenly brought to an end, psychical phenomena are no longer\nmanifested. From first to last, therefore, our appeal to\nexperience gets but one response. We have not the faintest shadow\nof evidence wherewith to make it seem probable that Mind can\nexist except in connection with a material body. Viewed from this\nstandpoint of terrestrial experience, there is no more reason for\nsupposing that consciousness survives the dissolution of the\nbrain than for supposing that the pungent flavour of table-salt\nsurvives its decomposition into metallic sodium and gaseous\nchlorine.",
        "Our answer from this side is thus unequivocal enough. Indeed, so\nuniform has been the teaching of experience in this respect that\neven in their attempts to depict a life after death, men have\nalways found themselves obliged to have recourse to materialistic\nsymbols. To the mind of a savage the future world is a mere\nreproduction of the present, with its everlasting huntings and\nfightings. The early Christians looked forward to a renovation of\nthe earth and the bodily resurrection from Sheol of the\nrighteous. The pictures of hell and purgatory, and even of\nparadise, in Dante’s great poem, are so intensely materialistic\nas to seem grotesque in this more spiritual age. But even to-day\nthe popular conceptions of heaven are by no means freed from the\nnotion of matter; and persons of high culture, who realize the\ninadequacy of these popular conceptions, are wont to avoid the\ndifficulty by refraining from putting their hopes and beliefs\ninto any definite or describable form. Not unfrequently one sees\na smile raised at the assumption of knowledge or insight by\npreachers who describe in eloquent terms the joys of a future\nstate; yet the smile does not necessarily imply any scepticism as\nto the abstract probability of the soul’s survival. The\nscepticism is aimed at the character of the description rather\nthan at the reality of the thing described. It implies a tacit\nagreement, among cultivated people, that the unseen world must be\npurely spiritual in constitution. The agreement is not habitually\nexpressed in definite formulas, for the reason that no mental\nimage of a purely spiritual world can be formed. Much stress is\ncommonly laid upon the recognition of friends in a future life;\nand however deep a meaning may be given to the phrase “the love\nof God,” one does not easily realize that a heavenly existence\ncould be worth the longing that is felt for it, if it were to\nafford no further scope for the pure and tender household\naffections which give to the present life its powerful though\nindefinable charm. Yet the recognition of friends in a purely\nspiritual world is something of which we can frame no conception\nwhatever. We may look with unspeakable reverence on the features\nof wife or child, less because of their physical beauty than\nbecause of the beauty of soul to which they give expression, but\nto imagine the perception of soul by soul apart from the material\nstructure and activities in which soul is manifested, is\nsomething utterly beyond our power. Nay, even when we try to\nrepresent to ourselves the psychical activity of any single soul\nby itself as continuing without the aid of the physical machinery\nof sensation, we get into unmanageable difficulties. A great part\nof the contents of our minds consists of sensuous (chiefly\nvisual) images, and though we may imagine reflection to go on\nwithout further images supplied by vision or hearing, touch or\ntaste or smell, yet we cannot well see how fresh experiences\ncould be gained in such a state. The reader, if he require\nfurther illustrations, can easily follow out this line of\nthought. Enough has no doubt been said to convince him that our\nhypothesis of the survival of conscious activity apart from\nmaterial conditions is not only utterly unsupported by any\nevidence that can be gathered from the world of which we have\nexperience, but is utterly and hopelessly inconceivable.",
        "It is inconceivable BECAUSE it is entirely without foundation in\nexperience. Our powers of conception are closely determined by\nthe limits of our experience. When a proposition, or combination\nof ideas, is suggested, for which there has never been any\nprecedent in human experience, we find it to be UNTHINKABLE,—the\nideas will not combine. The proposition remains one which we may\nutter and defend, and perhaps vituperate our neighbours for not\naccepting, but it remains none the less an unthinkable\nproposition. It takes terms which severally have meanings and\nputs them together into a phrase which has no meaning.[11] Now\nwhen we try to combine the idea of the continuance of conscious\nactivity with the idea of the entire cessation of material\nconditions, and thereby to assert the existence of a purely\nspiritual world, we find that we have made an unthinkable\nproposition. We may defend our hypothesis as passionately as we\nlike, but when we strive coolly to realize it in thought we find\nourselves baulked at every step.",
        "[11] See my Outlines of Cosmic Philosophy, Vol. I. pp. 64-67.",
        "But now we have to ask, How much does this inconceivability\nsignify? In most cases, when we say that a statement is\ninconceivable, we practically declare it to be untrue; when we\nsay that a statement is without warrant in experience, we plainly\nindicate that we consider it unworthy of our acceptance. This is\nlegitimate in the majority of cases with which we have to deal in\nthe course of life, because experience, and the capacities of\nthought called out and limited by experience, are our only guides\nin the conduct of life. But every one will admit that our\nexperience is not infinite, and that our capacity of conception\nis not coextensive with the possibilities of existence. It is not\nonly possible, but in the very highest degree probable, that\nthere are many things in heaven, if not on earth, which are\nundreamed of in our philosophy. Since our ability to conceive\nanything is limited by the extent of our experience, and since\nhuman experience is very far from being infinite, it follows that\nthere may be, and in all probability is, an immense region of\nexistence in every way as real as the region which we know, yet\nconcerning which we cannot form the faintest rudiment of a\nconception. Any hypothesis relating to such a region of existence\nis not only not disproved by the total failure of evidence in its\nfavour, but the total failure of evidence does not raise even the\nslightest prima facie presumption against its validity.",
        "These considerations apply with great force to the hypothesis of\nan unseen world in which psychical phenomena persist in the\nabsence of material conditions. It is true, on the one hand, that\nwe can bring up no scientific evidence in support of such an\nhypothesis. But on the other hand it is equally true that in the\nvery nature of things no such evidence could be expected to be\nforthcoming: even were there such evidence in abundance, it could\nnot be accessible to us. The existence of a single soul, or\ncongeries of psychical phenomena, unaccompanied by a material\nbody, would be evidence sufficient to demonstrate the hypothesis.\nBut in the nature of things, even were there a million such souls\nround about us, we could not become aware of the existence of one\nof them, for we have no organ or faculty for the perception of\nsoul apart from the material structure and activities in which it\nhas been manifested throughout the whole course of our\nexperience. Even our own self-consciousness involves the\nconsciousness of ourselves as partly material bodies. These\nconsiderations show that our hypothesis is very different from\nthe ordinary hypotheses with which science deals. The entire\nabsence of testimony does not raise a negative presumption except\nin cases where testimony is accessible. In the hypotheses with\nwhich scientific men are occupied, testimony is always\naccessible; and if we do not find any, the presumption is raised\nthat there is none. When Dr. Bastian tells us that he has found\nliving organisms to be generated in sealed flasks from which all\nliving germs had been excluded, we demand the evidence for his\nassertion. The testimony of facts is in this case hard to elicit,\nand only skilful reasoners can properly estimate its worth. But\nstill it is all accessible. With more or less labour it can be\ngot at; and if we find that Dr. Bastian has produced no evidence\nsave such as may equally well receive a different interpretation\nfrom that which he has given it, we rightly feel that a strong\npresumption has been raised against his hypothesis. It is a case\nin which we are entitled to expect to find the favouring facts if\nthere are any, and so long as we do not find such, we are\njustified in doubting their existence. So when our authors\npropound the hypothesis of an unseen universe consisting of\nphenomena which occur in the interstellar ether, or even in some\nprimordial fluid with which the ether has physical relations, we\nare entitled to demand their proofs. It is not enough to tell us\nthat we cannot disprove such a theory. The burden of proof lies\nwith them. The interstellar ether is something concerning the\nphysical properties of which we have some knowledge; and surely,\nif all the things are going on which they suppose in a medium so\nclosely related to ordinary matter, there ought to be some\ntraceable indications of the fact. At least, until the contrary\ncan be shown, we must refuse to believe that all the testimony in\na case like this is utterly inaccessible; and accordingly, so\nlong as none is found, especially so long as none is even\nalleged, we feel that a presumption is raised against their\ntheory.",
        "These illustrations will show, by sheer contrast, how different\nit is with the hypothesis of an unseen world that is purely\nspiritual. The testimony in such a case must, under the\nconditions of the present life, be forever inaccessible. It lies\nwholly outside the range of experience. However abundant it may\nbe, we cannot expect to meet with it. And accordingly our failure\nto produce it does not raise even the slightest presumption\nagainst our theory. When conceived in this way, the belief in a\nfuture life is without scientific support; but at the same time\nit is placed beyond the need of scientific support and beyond the\nrange of scientific criticism. It is a belief which no imaginable\nfuture advance in physical discovery can in any way impugn. It is\na belief which is in no sense irrational, and which may be\nlogically entertained without in the least affecting our\nscientific habit of mind or influencing our scientific\nconclusions.",
        "To take a brief illustration: we have alluded to the fact that in\nthe history of our present world the development of mental\nphenomena has gone on hand in hand with the development of\norganic life, while at the same time we have found it impossible\nto explain mental phenomena as in any sense the product of\nmaterial phenomena. Now there is another side to all this. The\ngreat lesson which Berkeley taught mankind was that what we call\nmaterial phenomena are really the products of consciousness\nco-operating with some Unknown Power (not material) existing\nbeyond consciousness. We do very well to speak of “matter” in\ncommon parlance, but all that the word really means is a group of\nqualities which have no existence apart from our minds. Modern\nphilosophers have quite generally accepted this conclusion, and\nevery attempt to overturn Berkeley’s reasoning has hitherto\nresulted in complete and disastrous failure. In admitting this,\nwe do not admit the conclusion of Absolute Idealism, that nothing\nexists outside of consciousness. What we admit as existing\nindependently of our own consciousness is the Power that causes\nin us those conscious states which we call the perception of\nmaterial qualities. We have no reason for regarding this Power as\nin itself material: indeed, we cannot do so, since by the theory\nmaterial qualities have no existence apart from our minds. I have\nelsewhere sought to show that less difficulty is involved in\nregarding this Power outside of us as quasi-psychical, or in some\nmeasure similar to the mental part of ourselves; and I have gone\non to conclude that this Power may be identical with what men\nhave, in all times and by the aid of various imperfect symbols,\nendeavoured to apprehend as Deity.[12] We are thus led to a view\nof things not very unlike the views entertained by Spinoza and\nBerkeley. We are led to the inference that what we call the\nmaterial universe is but the manifestation of infinite Deity to\nour finite minds. Obviously, on this view, Matter—the only thing\nto which materialists concede real existence—is simply an\norderly phantasmagoria; and God and the Soul—which materialists\nregard as mere fictions of the imagination—are the only\nconceptions that answer to real existences.",
        "[12] See my Outlines of Cosmic Philosophy, Part I. Chap. IV.;\nPart III. Chaps. III., IV.",
        "In the foregoing paragraph I have been setting down opinions with\nwhich I am prepared to agree, and which are not in conflict with\nanything that our study of the development of the objective world\nhas taught us. In so far as that study may be supposed to bear on\nthe question of a future life, two conclusions are open to us.\nFirst we may say that since the phenomena of mind appear and run\ntheir course along with certain specialized groups of material\nphenomena, so, too, they must disappear when these specialized\ngroups are broken up. Or, in other words, we may say that every\nliving person is an organized whole; consciousness is something\nwhich pertains to this organized whole, as music belongs to the\nharp that is entire; but when the harp is broken it is silent,\nand when the organized whole of personality falls to pieces\nconsciousness ceases forever. To many well-disciplined minds this\nconclusion seems irresistible; and doubtless it would be a sound\none—a good Baconian conclusion—if we were to admit, with the\nmaterialists, that the possibilities of existence are limited by\nour tiny and ephemeral experience.",
        "But now, supposing some Platonic speculator were to come along\nand insist upon our leaving room for an alternative conclusion;\nsuppose he were to urge upon us that all this process of material\ndevelopment, with the discovery of which our patient study has\nbeen rewarded, may be but the temporary manifestation of\nrelations otherwise unknown between ourselves and the infinite\nDeity; suppose he were to argue that psychical qualities may be\ninherent in a spiritual substance which under certain conditions\nbecomes incarnated in matter, to wear it as a perishable garment\nfor a brief season, but presently to cast it off and enter upon\nthe freedom of a larger existence;—what reply should we be bound\nto make, bearing in mind that the possibilities of existence are\nin no wise limited by our experience? Obviously we should be\nbound to admit that in sound philosophy this conclusion is just\nas likely to be true as the other. We should, indeed, warn him\nnot to call on us to help him to establish it by scientific\narguments; and we should remind him that he must not make illicit\nuse of his extra-experiential hypotheses by bringing them into\nthe treatment of scientific questions that lie within the range\nof experience. In science, for example, we make no use of the\nconception of a “spiritual substance” (or of a “material\nsubstance” either), because we can get along sufficiently well by\ndealing solely with qualities. But with this general\nunderstanding we should feel bound to concede the impregnableness\nof his main position.",
        "I have supposed this theory only as an illustration, not as a\ntheory which I am prepared to adopt. My present purpose is not to\ntreat as an advocate the question of a future life, but to\nendeavour to point out what conditions should be observed in\ntreating the question philosophically. It seems to me that a\ngreat deal is gained when we have distinctly set before us what\nare the peculiar conditions of proof in the case of such\ntranscendental questions. We have gained a great deal when we\nhave learned how thoroughly impotent, how truly irrelevant, is\nphysical investigation in the presence of such a question. If we\nget not much positive satisfaction for our unquiet yearnings, we\noccupy at any rate a sounder philosophic position when we\nrecognize the limits within which our conclusions, whether\npositive or negative, are valid.",
        "It seems not improbable that Mr. Mill may have had in mind\nsomething like the foregoing considerations when he suggested\nthat there is no reason why one should not entertain the belief\nin a future life if the belief be necessary to one’s spiritual\ncomfort. Perhaps no suggestion in Mr. Mill’s richly suggestive\nposthumous work has been more generally condemned as\nunphilosophical, on the ground that in matters of belief we must\nbe guided, not by our likes and dislikes, but by the evidence\nthat is accessible. The objection is certainly a sound one so far\nas it relates to scientific questions where evidence is\naccessible. To hesitate to adopt a well-supported theory because\nof some vague preference for a different view is in scientific\nmatters the one unpardonable sin,—a sin which has been only too\noften committed. Even in matters which lie beyond the range of\nexperience, where evidence is inaccessible, desire is not to be\nregarded as by itself an adequate basis for belief. But it seems\nto me that Mr. Mill showed a deeper knowledge of the limitations\nof scientific method than his critics, when he thus hinted at the\npossibility of entertaining a belief not amenable to scientific\ntests. The hypothesis of a purely spiritual unseen world, as\nabove described, is entirely removed from the jurisdiction of\nphysical inquiry, and can only be judged on general\nconsiderations of what has been called “moral probability\"; and\nconsiderations of this sort are likely, in the future as in the\npast, to possess different values for different minds. He who, on\nsuch considerations, entertains a belief in a future life may not\ndemand that his sceptical neighbour shall be convinced by the\nsame considerations; but his neighbour is at the same time\nestopped from stigmatizing his belief as unphilosophical.",
        "The consideration which must influence most minds in their\nattitude toward this question, is the craving, almost universally\nfelt, for some teleological solution to the problem of existence.\nWhy we are here now is a question of even profounder interest\nthan whether we are to live hereafter. Unfortunately its solution\ncarries us no less completely beyond the range of experience! The\nbelief that all things are working together for some good end is\nthe most essential expression of religious faith: of all\nintellectual propositions it is the one most closely related to\nthat emotional yearning for a higher and better life which is the\nsum and substance of religion. Yet all the treatises on natural\ntheology that have ever been written have barely succeeded in\nestablishing a low degree of scientific probability for this\nbelief. In spite of the eight Bridgewater Treatises, and the\n\"Ninth” beside, dysteleology still holds full half the field as\nagainst teleology. Most of this difficulty, however, results from\nthe crude anthropomorphic views which theologians have held\nconcerning God. Once admitting that the Divine attributes may be\n(as they must be) incommensurably greater than human attributes,\nour faith that all things are working together for good may\nremain unimpugned.",
        "To many minds such a faith will seem incompatible with belief in\nthe ultimate destruction of sentiency amid the general doom of\nthe material universe. A good end can have no meaning to us save\nin relation to consciousness that distinguishes and knows the\ngood from the evil. There could be no better illustration of how\nwe are hemmed in than the very inadequacy of the words with which\nwe try to discuss this subject. Such words have all gained their\nmeanings from human experience, and hence of necessity carry\nanthropomorphic implications. But we cannot help this. We must\nthink with the symbols with which experience has furnished us;\nand when we so think, there does seem to be little that is even\nintellectually satisfying in the awful picture which science\nshows us, of giant worlds concentrating out of nebulous vapour,\ndeveloping with prodigious waste of energy into theatres of all\nthat is grand and sacred in spiritual endeavour, clashing and\nexploding again into dead vapour-balls, only to renew the same\ntoilful process without end,—a senseless bubble-play of Titan\nforces, with life, love, and aspiration brought forth only to be\nextinguished. The human mind, however “scientific” its training,\nmust often recoil from the conclusion that this is all; and there\nare moments when one passionately feels that this cannot be all.\nOn warm June mornings in green country lanes, with sweet\npine-odours wafted in the breeze which sighs through the\nbranches, and cloud-shadows flitting over far-off blue mountains,\nwhile little birds sing their love-songs, and golden-haired\nchildren weave garlands of wild roses; or when in the solemn\ntwilight we listen to wondrous harmonies of Beethoven and Chopin\nthat stir the heart like voices from an unseen world; at such\ntimes one feels that the profoundest answer which science can\ngive to our questionings is but a superficial answer after all.\nAt these moments, when the world seems fullest of beauty, one\nfeels most strongly that it is but the harbinger of something\nelse,—that the ceaseless play of phenomena is no mere sport of\nTitans, but an orderly scene, with its reason for existing, its",
        "Difficult as it is to disentangle the elements of reasoning that\nenter into these complex groups of feeling, one may still see, I\nthink, that it is speculative interest in the world, rather than\nanxious interest in self, that predominates. The desire for\nimmortality in its lowest phase is merely the outcome of the\nrepugnance we feel toward thinking of the final cessation of\nvigorous vital activity. Such a feeling is naturally strong with\nhealthy people. But in the mood which I have above tried to\ndepict, this feeling, or any other which is merely\nself-regarding, is lost sight of in the feeling which associates\na future life with some solution of the burdensome problem of\nexistence. Had we but faith enough to lighten the burden of this\nproblem, the inferior question would perhaps be less absorbing.\nCould we but know that our present lives are working together\ntoward some good end, even an end in no wise anthropomorphic, it\nwould be of less consequence whether we were individually to\nendure. To the dog under the knife of the experimenter, the world\nis a world of pure evil; yet could the poor beast but understand\nthe alleviation of human suffering to which he is contributing,\nhe would be forced to own that this is not quite true; and if he\nwere also a heroic or Christian dog, the thought would perhaps\ntake away from death its sting. The analogy may be a crude one;\nbut the reasonableness of the universe is at least as far above\nour comprehension as the purposes of man surpass the\nunderstanding of the dog. Believing, however, though as a simple\nact of trust, that the end will crown the work, we may rise\nsuperior to the question which has here concerned us, and\nexclaim, in the supreme language of faith, “Though He slay me,\nyet will I trust in Him!”",

        "Few of those who find pleasure in frequenting bookstores can have\nfailed to come across one or more of the profusely illustrated\nvolumes in which M. Louis Figuier has sought to render dry\nscience entertaining to the multitude. And of those who may have\ncasually turned over their pages, there are probably none,\ncompetent to form an opinion, who have not speedily perceived\nthat these pretentious books belong to the class of pests and\nunmitigated nuisances in literature. Antiquated views, utter lack\nof comprehension of the subjects treated, and shameless\nunscrupulousness as to accuracy of statement, are faults but ill\natoned for by sensational pictures of the “dragons of the prime\nthat tare each other in their slime,” or of the Newton-like brow\nand silken curls of that primitive man in contrast with whom the\nsaid dragons have been likened to “mellow music.”",
        "Nevertheless, the sort of scientific reputation which these\ndiscreditable performances have gained for M. Figuier among an\nuncritical public is such as to justify us in devoting a few\nparagraphs to a book[13] which, on its own merits, is unworthy of\nany notice whatever. “The To-morrow of Death\"—if one were to put\nhis trust in the translator’s prefatory note—discusses a grave\nquestion upon “purely scientific methods.” We are glad to see\nthis remark, because it shows what notions may be entertained by\npersons of average intelligence with reference to “scientific\nmethods.” Those—and they are many—who vaguely think that\nscience is something different from common-sense, and that any\nbook is scientific which talks about perihelia and asymptotes and\ncetacea, will find their vague notions here well corroborated.\nQuite different will be the impression made upon those—and they\nare yet too few—who have learned that the method of science is\nthe common-sense method of cautiously weighing evidence and\nwithholding judgment where evidence is not forthcoming. If\ntalking about remote and difficult subjects suffice to make one\nscientific, then is M. Figuier scientific to a quite terrible\ndegree. He writes about the starry heavens as if he had been\npresent at the hour of creation, or had at least accompanied the\nArabian prophet on his famous night-journey. Nor is his knowledge\nof physiology and other abstruse sciences at all less remarkable.\nBut these things will cease to surprise us when we learn the\nsources, hitherto suspected only in mythology, from which\nfavoured mortals can obtain a knowledge of what is going on\noutside of our planet.",

        "The four inner planets being nearly alike in size (?) and in\nlength of day, M. Figuier infers, by strictly scientific methods,\nthat whatever is true of one of them, as our earth, will be true\nof the others (p. 34). Hence, they are all inhabited by human\nbeings. It is true that human beings must find Venus rather warm,\nand are not unlikely to be seriously incommoded by the tropical\nclimate of Mercury. But we must remember that “the men of Venus\nand Mercury are made by nature to resist heat, as those of\nJupiter and Saturn are made to endure cold, and those of the\nEarth and Mars to live in a mean temperature: OTHERWISE THEY\nCOULD NOT EXIST” (p. 72). In view of this charming specimen of a\ntruly scientific inference, it is almost too bad to call\nattention to the fact that M. Figuier is quite behind the age in\nhis statement of facts. So far from Jupiter and Saturn being\ncold, observation plainly indicates that they are prodigiously\nhot, if not even incandescent and partly self-luminous; the\nexplanation being that, by reason of their huge bulk, they still\nretain much of the primitive heat which smaller planets have more\nquickly radiated away. As for M. Figuier’s statement, that polar\nsnows have been witnessed on these planets, it is simply untrue;\nno such thing has ever been seen there. Mars, on the other hand,\nhas been observed to resemble in many important respects its near\nneighbour, the Earth; whence our author declares that if an\naeronaut were to shoot clear of terrestrial gravitation and land\nupon Mars, he would unquestionably suppose himself to be still\nupon the earth. For aerolites, it seems, are somehow fired down\nupon our planet both from Mars and from Venus; and aerolites\nsometimes contain vegetable matter (?). Therefore, Mars has a\nvegetation, and very likely its red colour is caused by its\nluxuriant autumnal foliage! (p. 47.) To return to Jupiter: this\nplanet, indeed, has inconveniently short days. “In his ’Picture\nof the Heavens,’ the German astronomer, Littrow (these Germans\nthink of nothing but gormandizing), asks how the people of\nJupiter order their meals in the short interval of five hours.\"\nNevertheless, says our author, the great planet is compensated\nfor this inconvenience by its equable and delicious climate.",
        "In view, however, of our author’s more striking and original\ndisclosures, one would suppose that all this discussion of the\nphysical conditions of existence on the various planets might\nhave been passed over without detriment to the argument. After\nthese efforts at proving (for M. Figuier presumably regards this\nrigmarole as proof) that all the members of our solar system are\nhabitable, the interplanetary ether is forthwith peopled thickly\nwith “souls,” without any resort to argument. This, we suppose,\nis one of those scientific truths which as M. Figuier tells us,\nprecede and underlie demonstration. Upon this impregnable basis\nis reared the scientific theory of a future life. When we die our\nsoul passes into some other terrestrial body, unless we have been\nvery good, in which case we at once soar aloft and join the noble\nfraternity of the ether-folk. Bad men and young children, on\ndying, must undergo renewed probation here below, but ultimately\nall pass away into the interplanetary ether. The dweller in ether\nis chiefly distinguished from the mundane mortal by his acute\nsenses and his ability to subsist without food. He can see as if\nthrough a telescope and microscope combined. His intelligence is\nso great that in comparison an Aristotle would seem idiotic. It\nshould not be forgotten, too, that he possesses eighty-five per\ncent of soul to fifteen per cent of body, whereas in terrestrial\nman the two elements are mixed in equal proportions. There is no\nsex among the ether-folk, their numbers being kept up by the\ninflux of souls from the various planets. “Alimentation, that\nnecessity which tyrannizes over men and animals, is not imposed\nupon the inhabitants of ether. Their bodies must be repaired and\nsustained by the simple respiration of the fluid in which they\nare immersed, that is, of ether.” Most likely, continues our\nscientific author, the physiological functions of the ether-folk\nare confined to respiration, and that it is possible to breathe\n\"without numerous organs is proved by the fact that in all of a\nwhole class of animals—the batrachians—the mere bare skin\nconstitutes the whole machinery of respiration” (p. 95). Allowing\nfor the unfortunate slip of the pen by which “batrachians” are\nsubstituted for “fresh-water polyps,” how can we fail to admire\nthe severity of the scientific method employed in reaching these\ninteresting conclusions?",
        "But the King of Serendib must die, nor will the relentless scythe\nof Time spare our Etherians, with all their exalted attributes.\nThey will die repeatedly; and after having through sundry periods\nof probation attained spiritual perfection, they will all pour\ninto the sun. Since it is the sun which originates life and\nfeeling and thought upon the surface of our earth, “why may we\nnot declare that the rays transmitted by the sun to the earth and\nthe other planets are nothing more nor less than the emanations\nof these souls?” And now we may begin to form an adequate\nconception, of the rigorously scientific character of our\nauthor’s method. There have been many hypotheses by which to\naccount for the supply of solar radiance. One of the most\ningenious and probable of these hypotheses is that of Helmholtz,\naccording to which the solar radiance is due to the arrested\nmotion of the sun’s constituent particles toward their common\ncentre of gravity. But this is too fanciful to satisfy M.\nFiguier. The speculations of Helmholtz “have the disadvantage of\nresting on the idea of the sun’s nebulosity,—an hypothesis which\nwould need to be more closely examined before serving as a basis\nfor so important a deduction.” Accordingly, M. Figuier propounds\nan explanation which possesses the signal advantage that there is\nnothing hypothetical in it. “In our opinion, the solar radiation\nis sustained by the continual influx of souls into the sun.\"\nThis, as the reader will perceive, is the well-known theory of\nMayer, that the solar heat is due to a perennial bombardment of\nthe sun by meteors, save that, in place of gross materialistic\nmeteors, M. Figuier puts ethereal souls. The ether-folk are daily\nraining into the solar orb in untold millions, and to the\nunceasing concussion is due the radiation which maintains life in\nthe planets, and thus the circle is complete.",
        "In spite of their exalted position, the ether-folk do not disdain\nto mingle with the affairs of terrestrial mortals. They give us\ncounsel in dreams, and it is from this source, we presume, that\nour author has derived his rigid notions as to scientific method.\nIn evidence of this dream-theory we have the usual array of\ncases, “a celebrated journalist, M. R——,” “M. L——, a lawyer,\"\netc., etc., as in most books of this kind.",
        "M. Figuier is not a Darwinian: the derivation of our bodies from\nthe bodies of apes is a conception too grossly materialistic for\nhim. Our souls, however, he is quite willing to derive from the\nsouls of lower animals. Obviously we have pre-existed; how are we\nto account for Mozart’s precocity save by supposing his\npre-existence? He brought with him the musical skill acquired in\na previous life. In general, the souls of musical children come\nfrom nightingales, while the souls of great architects have\npassed into them from beavers (p. 247). We do not remember these\npast existences, it is true; but when we become ether-folk, we\nshall be able to look back in recollection over the whole series.",
        "Amid these sublime inquiries, M. Figuier is sometimes notably\noblivious of humbler truths, as might indeed be expected. Thus he\nrepeatedly alludes to Locke as the author of the doctrine of\ninnate ideas (!!),[14] and he informs us that Kepler never\nquitted Protestant England (p. 336), though we believe that the\nnearest Kepler ever came to living in England was the refusing of\nSir Henry Wotton’s request that he should move thither.",

        "And lastly, we are treated to a real dialogue, with quite a\ndramatic mise en scene. The author’s imaginary friend,\nTheophilus, enters, “seats himself in a comfortable chair, places\nan ottoman under his feet, a book under his elbow to support it,\nand a cigarette of Turkish tobacco between his lips, and sets\nhimself to the task of listening with a grave air of\ncollectedness, relieved by a certain touch of suspicious\nseverity, as becomes the arbiter in a literary and philosophic\nmatter.” “And so,” begins our author, “you wish to know, my dear\nTheophilus, WHERE I LOCATE GOD? I locate him in the centre of the\nuniverse, or, in better phrase, at the central focus, which must\nexist somewhere, of all the stars that make the universe, and\nwhich, borne onward in a common movement, gravitate together\naround this focus.”",

        "In republishing this and the following article on “The Christ of\nDogma,” I am aware that they do but scanty justice to their very\ninteresting subjects. So much ground is covered that it would be\nimpossible to treat it satisfactorily in a pair of\nreview-articles; and in particular the views adopted with regard\nto the New Testament literature are rather indicated than\njustified. These defects I hope to remedy in a future work on\n\"Jesus of Nazareth, and the Founding of Christianity,” for which\nthe present articles must be regarded as furnishing only a few\nintroductory hints. This work has been for several years on my\nmind, but as it may still be long before I can find the leisure\nneedful for writing it out, it seemed best to republish these\npreliminary sketches which have been some time out of print. The\nprojected work, however, while covering all the points here\ntreated, will have a much wider scope, dealing on the one hand\nwith the natural genesis of the complex aggregate of beliefs and\naspirations known as Christianity, and on the other hand with the\nmetamorphoses which are being wrought in this aggregate by modern\nknowledge and modern theories of the world.",

The author of\n\"Supernatural Religion” would no doubt admit that, even if the\nsynoptic gospels had not assumed their present form before the\nend of the second century, nevertheless the body of tradition\ncontained in them had been committed to writing very early in\nthat century.

With their value as testimony to so-called\nSUPERNATURAL events, the present essay is in no way concerned.",
        "Of all the great founders of religions, Jesus is at once the best\nknown and the least known to the modern scholar. From the\ndogmatic point of view he is the best known, from the historic\npoint of view he is the least known. The Christ of dogma is in\nevery lineament familiar to us from early childhood; but\nconcerning the Jesus of history we possess but few facts resting\nupon trustworthy evidence, and in order to form a picture of him\nat once consistent, probable, and distinct in its outlines, it is\nnecessary to enter upon a long and difficult investigation, in\nthe course of which some of the most delicate apparatus of modern\ncriticism is required. This circumstance is sufficiently singular\nto require especial explanation. The case of Sakyamuni, the\nfounder of Buddhism, which may perhaps be cited as parallel, is\nin reality wholly different. Not only did Sakyamuni live five\ncenturies earlier than Jesus, among a people that have at no time\npossessed the art of insuring authenticity in their records of\nevents, and at an era which is at best but dimly discerned\nthrough the mists of fable and legend, but the work which he\nachieved lies wholly out of the course of European history, and\nit is only in recent times that his career has presented itself\nto us as a problem needing to be solved. Jesus, on the other\nhand, appeared in an age which is familiarly and in many respects\nminutely known to us, and among a people whose fortunes we can\ntrace with historic certainty for at least seven centuries\nprevious to his birth; while his life and achievements have\nprobably had a larger share in directing the entire subsequent\nintellectual and moral development of Europe than those of any\nother man who has ever lived. Nevertheless, the details of his\npersonal career are shrouded in an obscurity almost as dense as\nthat which envelops the life of the remote founder of Buddhism.",
        "This phenomenon, however, appears less strange and paradoxical\nwhen we come to examine it more closely. A little reflection will\ndisclose to us several good reasons why the historical records of\nthe life of Jesus should be so scanty as they are. In the first\nplace, the activity of Jesus was private rather than public.\nConfined within exceedingly narrow limits, both of space and of\nduration, it made no impression whatever upon the politics or the\nliterature of the time. His name does not occur in the pages of\nany contemporary writer, Roman, Greek, or Jewish. Doubtless the\ncase would have been wholly different, had he, like Mohammed,\nlived to a ripe age, and had the exigencies of his peculiar\nposition as the Messiah of the Jewish people brought him into\nrelations with the Empire; though whether, in such case, the\nsuccess of his grand undertaking would have been as complete as\nit has actually been, may well be doubted.",
        "Secondly, Jesus did not, like Mohammed and Paul, leave behind him\nauthentic writings which might serve to throw light upon his\nmental development as well as upon the external facts of his\ncareer. Without the Koran and the four genuine Epistles of Paul,\nwe should be nearly as much in the dark concerning these great\nmen as we now are concerning the historical Jesus. We should be\ncompelled to rely, in the one case, upon the untrustworthy gossip\nof Mussulman chroniclers, and in the other case upon the garbled\nstatements of the “Acts of the Apostles,” a book written with a\ndistinct dogmatic purpose, sixty or seventy years after the\noccurrence of the events which it professes to record.",
        "It is true, many of the words of Jesus, preserved by hearsay\ntradition through the generation immediately succeeding his\ndeath, have come down to us, probably with little alteration, in\nthe pages of the three earlier evangelists. These are priceless\ndata, since, as we shall see, they are almost the only materials\nat our command for forming even a partial conception of the\ncharacter of Jesus’ work. Nevertheless, even here the cautious\ninquirer has only too often to pause in face of the difficulty of\ndistinguishing the authentic utterances of the great teacher from\nthe later interpolations suggested by the dogmatic necessities of\nthe narrators. Bitterly must the historian regret that Jesus had\nno philosophic disciple, like Xenophon, to record his\nMemorabilia. Of the various writings included in the New\nTestament, the Apocalypse alone (and possibly the Epistle of\nJude) is from the pen of a personal acquaintance of Jesus; and\nbesides this, the four epistles of Paul, to the Galatians,\nCorinthians, and Romans, make up the sum of the writings from\nwhich we may expect contemporary testimony. Yet from these we\nobtain absolutely nothing of that for which we are seeking. The\nbrief writings of Paul are occupied exclusively with the internal\nsignificance of Jesus’ work. The epistle of Jude—if it be really\nwritten by Jesus’ brother of that name, which is doubtful—is\nsolely a polemic directed against the innovations of Paul. And\nthe Apocalypse, the work of the fiery and imaginative disciple\nJohn, is confined to a prophetic description of the Messiah’s\nanticipated return, and tells us nothing concerning the deeds of\nthat Messiah while on the earth.",
        "Here we touch upon our third consideration,—the consideration\nwhich best enables us to see why the historic notices of Jesus\nare so meagre. Rightly considered, the statement with which we\nopened this article is its own explanation. The Jesus of history\nis so little known just because the Christ of dogma is so well\nknown.[16] Other teachers—Paul, Mohammed, Sakyamuni—have come\nmerely as preachers of righteousness, speaking in the name of\ngeneral principles with which their own personalities were not\ndirectly implicated. But Jesus, as we shall see, before the close\nof his life, proclaimed himself to be something more than a\npreacher of righteousness. He announced himself—and justly, from\nhis own point of view—as the long-expected Messiah sent by\nJehovah to liberate the Jewish race. Thus the success of his\nreligious teachings became at once implicated with the question\nof his personal nature and character. After the sudden and\nviolent termination of his career, it immediately became\nall-important with his followers to prove that he was really the\nMessiah, and to insist upon the certainty of his speedy return to\nthe earth. Thus the first generation of disciples dogmatized\nabout him, instead of narrating his life,—a task which to them\nwould have seemed of little profit. For them the all-absorbing\nobject of contemplation was the immediate future rather than the\nimmediate past. As all the earlier Christian literature informs\nus, for nearly a century after the death of Jesus, his followers\nlived in daily anticipation of his triumphant return to the\nearth. The end of all things being so near at hand, no attempt\nwas made to insure accurate and complete memoirs for the use of a\nposterity which was destined, in Christian imagination, never to\narrive. The first Christians wrote but little; even Papias, at\nthe end of a century, preferring second-hand or third-hand oral\ntradition to the written gospels which were then beginning to\ncome into circulation.[17] Memoirs of the life and teachings of\nJesus were called forth by the necessity of having a written\nstandard of doctrine to which to appeal amid the growing\ndifferences of opinion which disturbed the Church. Thus the\nearlier gospels exhibit, though in different degrees, the\nindications of a modifying, sometimes of an overruling dogmatic\npurpose. There is, indeed, no conscious violation of historic\ntruth, but from the varied mass of material supplied by\ntradition, such incidents are selected as are fit to support the\nviews of the writers concerning the personality of Jesus.\nAccordingly, while the early gospels throw a strong light upon\nthe state of Christian opinion at the dates when they were\nsuccessively composed, the information which they give concerning\nJesus himself is, for that very reason, often vague, uncritical,\nand contradictory. Still more is this true of the fourth gospel,\nwritten late in the second century, in which historic tradition\nis moulded in the interests of dogma until it becomes no longer\nrecognizable, and in the place of the human Messiah of the\nearlier accounts, we have a semi-divine Logos or Aeon, detached\nfrom God, and incarnate for a brief season in the likeness of\nman.",

        "Not only was history subordinated to dogma by the writers of the\ngospel-narratives, but in the minds of the Fathers of the Church\nwho assisted in determining what writings should be considered\ncanonical, dogmatic prepossession went very much further than\ncritical acumen. Nor is this strange when we reflect that\ncritical discrimination in questions of literary authenticity is\none of the latest acquisitions of the cultivated human mind. In\nthe early ages of the Church the evidence of the genuineness of\nany literary production was never weighed critically; writings\ncontaining doctrines acceptable to the majority of Christians\nwere quoted as authoritative while writings which supplied no\ndogmatic want were overlooked, or perhaps condemned as\napocryphal. A striking instance of this is furnished by the\nfortunes of the Apocalypse. Although perhaps the best\nauthenticated work in the New Testament collection, its\nmillenarian doctrines caused it to become unpopular as the Church\ngradually ceased to look for the speedy return of the Messiah,\nand, accordingly, as the canon assumed a definite shape, it was\nplaced among the “Antilegomena,” or doubtful books, and continued\nto hold a precarious position until after the time of the\nProtestant Reformation. On the other hand, the fourth gospel,\nwhich was quite unknown and probably did not exist at the time of\nthe Quartodeciman controversy (A. D. 168), was accepted with\nlittle hesitation, and at the beginning of the third century is\nmentioned by Irenaeus, Clement, and Tertullian, as the work of\nthe Apostle John. To this uncritical spirit, leading to the\nneglect of such books as failed to answer the dogmatic\nrequirements of the Church, may probably be attributed the loss\nof so many of the earlier gospels. It is doubtless for this\nreason that we do not possess the Aramaean original of the\n\"Logia” of Matthew, or the “Memorabilia” of Mark, the companion\nof Peter,—two works to which Papias (A. D. 120) alludes as\ncontaining authentic reports of the utterances of Jesus.",
        "These considerations will, we believe, sufficiently explain the\ncurious circumstance that, while we know the Christ of dogma so\nintimately, we know the Jesus of history so slightly. The\nliterature of early Christianity enables us to trace with\ntolerable completeness the progress of opinion concerning the\nnature of Jesus, from the time of Paul’s early missions to the\ntime of the Nicene Council; but upon the actual words and deeds\nof Jesus it throws a very unsteady light. The dogmatic purpose\neverywhere obscures the historic basis.",
        "This same dogmatic prepossession which has rendered the data for\na biography of Jesus so scanty and untrustworthy, has also until\ncomparatively recent times prevented any unbiassed critical\nexamination of such data as we actually possess. Previous to the\neighteenth century any attempt to deal with the life of Jesus\nupon purely historical methods would have been not only contemned\nas irrational, but stigmatized as impious. And even in the\neighteenth century, those writers who had become wholly\nemancipated from ecclesiastic tradition were so destitute of all\nhistoric sympathy and so unskilled in scientific methods of\ncriticism, that they utterly failed to comprehend the\nrequirements of the problem. Their aims were in the main polemic,\nnot historical. They thought more of overthrowing current dogmas\nthan of impartially examining the earliest Christian literature\nwith a view of eliciting its historic contents; and, accordingly,\nthey accomplished but little. Two brilliant exceptions must,\nhowever, be noticed. Spinoza, in the seventeenth century, and\nLessing, in the eighteenth, were men far in advance of their age.\nThey are the fathers of modern historical criticism; and to\nLessing in particular, with his enormous erudition and\nincomparable sagacity, belongs the honour of initiating that\nmethod of inquiry which, in the hands of the so-called Tubingen\nSchool, has led to such striking and valuable conclusions\nconcerning, the age and character of all the New Testament\nliterature. But it was long before any one could be found fit to\nbend the bow which Lessing and Spinoza had wielded. A succession\nof able scholars—Semler, Eichhorn, Paulus, Schleiermacher\nBretschneider, and De Wette—were required to examine, with\nGerman patience and accuracy, the details of the subject, and to\npropound various untenable hypotheses, before such a work could\nbe performed as that of Strauss. The “Life of Jesus,” published\nby Strauss when only twenty-six years of age, is one of the\nmonumental works of the nineteenth century, worthy to rank, as a\nhistorical effort, along with such books as Niebuhr’s “History of\nRome,” Wolf’s “Prolegomena,” or Bentley’s “Dissertations on\nPhalaris.” It instantly superseded and rendered antiquated\neverything which had preceded it; nor has any work on early\nChristianity been written in Germany for the past thirty years\nwhich has not been dominated by the recollection of that\nmarvellous book. Nevertheless, the labours of another generation\nof scholars have carried our knowledge of the New Testament\nliterature far beyond the point which it had reached when Strauss\nfirst wrote. At that time the dates of but few of the New\nTestament writings had been fixed with any approach to certainty;\nthe age and character of the fourth gospel, the genuineness of\nthe Pauline epistles, even the mutual relations of the three\nsynoptics, were still undetermined; and, as a natural. result of\nthis uncertainty, the progress of dogma during the first century\nwas ill understood. At the present day it is impossible to read\nthe early work of Strauss without being impressed with the\nnecessity of obtaining positive data as to the origin and\ndogmatic character of the New Testament writings, before\nattempting to reach any conclusions as to the probable career of\nJesus. These positive data we owe to the genius and diligence of\nthe Tubingen School, and, above all, to its founder, Ferdinand\nChristian Baur. Beginning with the epistles of Paul, of which he\ndistinguished four as genuine, Baur gradually worked his way\nthrough the entire New Testament collection, detecting—with that\ninspired insight which only unflinching diligence can impart to\noriginal genius—the age at which each book was written, and the\ncircumstances which called it forth. To give any account of\nBaur’s detailed conclusions, or of the method by which he reached\nthem, would require a volume. They are very scantily presented in\nMr. Mackay’s work on the “Tubingen School and its Antecedents,\"\nto which we may refer the reader desirous of further information.\nWe can here merely say that twenty years of energetic controversy\nhave only served to establish most of Baur’s leading conclusions\nmore firmly than ever. The priority of the so-called gospel of\nMatthew, the Pauline purpose of “Luke,” the second in date of our\ngospels, the derivative and second-hand character of “Mark,” and\nthe unapostolic origin of the fourth gospel, are points which may\nfor the future be regarded as wellnigh established by\ncircumstantial evidence. So with respect to the pseudo-Pauline\nepistles, Baur’s work was done so thoroughly that the only\nquestion still left open for much discussion is that concerning\nthe date and authorship of the first and second\n\"Thessalonians,\"—a point of quite inferior importance, so far as\nour present subject is concerned. Seldom have such vast results\nbeen achieved by the labour of a single scholar. Seldom has any\nhistorical critic possessed such a combination of analytic and of\nco-ordinating powers as Baur. His keen criticism and his\nwonderful flashes of insight exercise upon the reader a truly\npoetic effect like that which is felt in contemplating the\nmarvels of physical discovery.",
        "The comprehensive labours of Baur were followed up by Zeller’s\nable work on the “Acts of the Apostles,” in which that book was\nshown to have been partly founded upon documents written by Luke,\nor some other companion of Paul, and expanded and modified by a\nmuch later writer with the purpose of covering up the traces of\nthe early schism between the Pauline and the Petrine sections of\nthe Church. Along with this, Schwegler’s work on the\n\"Post-Apostolic Times” deserves mention as clearing up many\nobscure points relating to the early development of dogma.\nFinally, the “New Life of Jesus,” by Strauss, adopting and\nutilizing the principal discoveries of Baur and his followers,\nand combining all into one grand historical picture, worthily\ncompletes the task which the earlier work of the same author had\ninaugurated.",
        "The reader will have noticed that, with the exception of Spinoza,\nevery one of the names above cited in connection with the\nliterary analysis and criticism of the New Testament is the name\nof a German. Until within the last decade, Germany has indeed\npossessed almost an absolute monopoly of the science of Biblical\ncriticism; other countries having remained not only unfamiliar\nwith its methods, but even grossly ignorant of its conspicuous\nresults, save when some German treatise of more than ordinary\npopularity has now and then been translated. But during the past\nten years France has entered the lists; and the writings of\nReville, Reuss, Nicolas, D’Eichthal, Scherer, and Colani testify\nto the rapidity with which the German seed has fructified upon\nher soil.[18]",
        "[18] But now, in annexing Alsace, Germany has “annexed” pretty\nmuch the whole of this department of French scholarship,—a\ncurious incidental consequence of the late war.",
        "None of these books, however, has achieved such wide-spread\ncelebrity, or done so much toward interesting the general public\nin this class of historical inquiries, as the “Life of Jesus,” by\nRenan. This pre-eminence of fame is partly, but not wholly,\ndeserved. From a purely literary point of view, Renan’s work\ndoubtless merits all the celebrity it has gained. Its author\nwrites a style such as is perhaps surpassed by that of no other\nliving Frenchman. It is by far the most readable book which has\never been written concerning the life of Jesus. And no doubt some\nof its popularity is due to its very faults, which, from a\ncritical point of view, are neither few nor small. For Renan is\ncertainly very faulty, as a historical critic, when he\npractically ignores the extreme meagreness of our positive\nknowledge of the career of Jesus, and describes scene after scene\nin his life as minutely and with as much confidence as if he had\nhimself been present to witness it all. Again and again the\ncritical reader feels prompted to ask, How do you know all this?\nor why, out of two or three conflicting accounts, do you quietly\nadopt some particular one, as if its superior authority were\nself-evident? But in the eye of the uncritical reader, these\ndefects are excellences; for it is unpleasant to be kept in\nignorance when we are seeking after definite knowledge, and it is\ndisheartening to read page after page of an elaborate discussion\nwhich ends in convincing us that definite knowledge cannot be\ngained.",
        "In the thirteenth edition of the “Vie de Jesus,” Renan has\ncorrected some of the most striking errors of the original work,\nand in particular has, with praiseworthy candour, abandoned his\nuntenable position with regard to the age and character of the\nfourth gospel. As is well known, Renan, in his earlier editions,\nascribed to this gospel a historical value superior to that of\nthe synoptics, believing it to have been written by an eyewitness\nof the events which it relates; and from this source,\naccordingly, he drew the larger share of his materials. Now, if\nthere is any one conclusion concerning the New Testament\nliterature which must be regarded as incontrovertibly established\nby the labours of a whole generation of scholars, it is this,\nthat the fourth gospel was utterly unknown until about A. D. 170,\nthat it was written by some one who possessed very little direct\nknowledge of Palestine, that its purpose was rather to expound a\ndogma than to give an accurate record of events, and that as a\nguide to the comprehension of the career of Jesus it is of far\nless value than the three synoptic gospels. It is impossible, in\na brief review like the present, to epitomize the evidence upon\nwhich this conclusion rests, which may more profitably be sought\nin the Rev. J. J. Tayler’s work on “The Fourth Gospel,” or in\nDavidson’s “Introduction to the New Testament.” It must suffice\nto mention that this gospel is not cited by Papias; that Justin,\nMarcion, and Valentinus make no allusion to it, though, since it\nfurnishes so much that is germane to their views, they would\ngladly have appealed to it, had it been in existence, when those\nviews were as yet under discussion; and that, finally, in the\ngreat Quartodeciman controversy, A. D. 168, the gospel is not\nonly not mentioned, but the authority of John is cited by\nPolycarp in flat contradiction of the view afterwards taken by\nthis evangelist. Still more, the assumption of Renan led at once\ninto complicated difficulties with reference to the Apocalypse.\nThe fourth gospel, if it does not unmistakably announce itself as\nthe work of John, at least professes to be Johannine; and it\ncannot for a moment be supposed that such a book, making such\nclaims, could have gained currency during John’s lifetime without\ncalling forth his indignant protest. For, in reality, no book in\nthe New Testament collection would so completely have shocked the\nprejudices of the Johannine party. John’s own views are well\nknown to us from the Apocalypse. John was the most enthusiastic\nof millenarians and the most narrow and rigid of Judaizers. In\nhis antagonism to the Pauline innovations he went farther than\nPeter himself. Intense hatred of Paul and his followers appears\nin several passages of the Apocalypse, where they are stigmatized\nas “Nicolaitans,” “deceivers of the people,” “those who say they\nare apostles and are not,” “eaters of meat offered to idols,\"\n\"fornicators,” “pretended Jews,” “liars,” “synagogue of Satan,\"\netc. (Chap. II.). On the other hand, the fourth gospel contains\nnothing millenarian or Judaical; it carries Pauline universalism\nto a far greater extent than Paul himself ventured to carry it,\neven condemning the Jews as children of darkness, and by\nimplication contrasting them unfavourably with the Gentiles; and\nit contains a theory of the nature of Jesus which the Ebionitish\nChristians, to whom John belonged, rejected to the last.",
        "In his present edition Renan admits the insuperable force of\nthese objections, and abandons his theory of the apostolic origin\nof the fourth gospel. And as this has necessitated the omission\nor alteration of all such passages as rested upon the authority\nof that gospel, the book is to a considerable extent rewritten,\nand the changes are such as greatly to increase its value as a\nhistory of Jesus. Nevertheless, the author has so long been in\nthe habit of shaping his conceptions of the career of Jesus by\nthe aid of the fourth gospel, that it has become very difficult\nfor him to pass freely to another point of view. He still clings\nto the hypothesis that there is an element of historic tradition\ncontained in the book, drawn from memorial writings which had\nperhaps been handed down from John, and which were inaccessible\nto the synoptists. In a very interesting appendix, he collects\nthe evidence in favour of this hypothesis, which indeed is not\nwithout plausibility, since there is every reason for supposing\nthat the gospel was written at Ephesus, which a century before\nhad been John’s place of residence. But even granting most of\nRenan’s assumptions, it must still follow that the authority of\nthis gospel is far inferior to that of the synoptics, and can in\nno case be very confidently appealed to. The question is one of\nthe first importance to the historian of early Christianity. In\ninquiring into the life of Jesus, the very first thing to do is\nto establish firmly in the mind the true relations of the fourth\ngospel to the first three. Until this has been done, no one is\ncompetent to write on the subject; and it is because he has done\nthis so imperfectly, that Renan’s work is, from a critical point\nof view, so imperfectly successful.",
        "The anonymous work entitled “The Jesus of History,” which we have\nplaced at the head of this article, is in every respect\nnoteworthy as the first systematic attempt made in England to\nfollow in the footsteps of German criticism in writing a life of\nJesus. We know of no good reason why the book should be published\nanonymously; for as a historical essay it possesses extraordinary\nmerit, and does great credit not only to its author, but to\nEnglish scholarship and acumen.[19] It is not, indeed, a book\ncalculated to captivate the imagination of the reading public.\nThough written in a clear, forcible, and often elegant style, it\npossesses no such wonderful rhetorical charm as the work of\nRenan; and it will probably never find half a dozen readers where\nthe “Vie de Jesus” has found a hundred. But the success of a book\nof this sort is not to be measured by its rhetorical excellence,\nor by its adaptation to the literary tastes of an uncritical and\nuninstructed public, but rather by the amount of critical\nsagacity which it brings to bear upon the elucidation of the many\ndifficult and disputed points in the subject of which it treats.\nMeasured by this standard, “The Jesus of History” must rank very\nhigh indeed. To say that it throws more light upon the career of\nJesus than any work which has ever before been written in English\nwould be very inadequate praise, since the English language has\nbeen singularly deficient in this branch of historical\nliterature. We shall convey a more just idea of its merits if we\nsay that it will bear comparison with anything which even Germany\nhas produced, save only the works of Strauss, Baur, and Zeller.",
        "[19] “The Jesus of History” is now known to have been written by\nSir Richard Hanson, Chief Justice of South Australia.",
        "The fitness of our author for the task which he has undertaken is\nshown at the outset by his choice of materials. In basing his\nconclusions almost exclusively upon the statements contained in\nthe first gospel, he is upheld by every sound principle of\ncriticism. The times and places at which our three synoptic\ngospels were written have been, through the labours of the\nTubingen critics, determined almost to a certainty. Of the three,\n\"Mark” is unquestionably the latest; with the exception of about\ntwenty verses, it is entirely made up from “Matthew” and “Luke,\"\nthe diverse Petrine and Pauline tendencies of which it strives to\nneutralize in conformity to the conciliatory disposition of the\nChurch at Rome, at the epoch at which this gospel was written,\nabout A. D. 130. The third gospel was also written at Rome, some\nfifteen years earlier. In the preface, its author describes it as\na compilation from previously existing written materials. Among\nthese materials was certainly the first gospel, several passages\nof which are adopted word for word by the author of “Luke.” Yet\nthe narrative varies materially from that of the first gospel in\nmany essential points. The arrangement of events is less natural,\nand, as in the “Acts of the Apostles,” by the same author, there\nis apparent throughout the design of suppressing the old discord\nbetween Paul and the Judaizing disciples, and of representing\nChristianity as essentially Pauline from the outset. How far Paul\nwas correct in his interpretation of the teachings of Jesus, it\nis difficult to decide. It is, no doubt, possible that the first\ngospel may have lent to the words of Jesus an Ebionite colouring\nin some instances, and that now and then the third gospel may\npresent us with a truer account. To this supremely important\npoint we shall by and by return. For the present it must suffice\nto observe that the evidences of an overruling dogmatic purpose\nare generally much more conspicuous in the third synoptist than\nin the first; and that the very loose manner in which this writer\nhas handled his materials in the “Acts” is not calculated to\ninspire us with confidence in the historical accuracy of his\ngospel. The writer who, in spite of the direct testimony of Paul\nhimself could represent the apostle to the Gentiles as acting\nunder the direction of the disciples at Jerusalem, and who puts\nPauline sentiments into the mouth of Peter, would certainly have\nbeen capable of unwarrantably giving a Pauline turn to the\nteachings of Jesus himself. We are therefore, as a last resort,\nbrought back to the first gospel, which we find to possess, as a\nhistorical narrative, far stronger claims upon our attention than\nthe second and third. In all probability it had assumed nearly\nits present shape before A. D. 100, its origin is unmistakably\nPalestinian; it betrays comparatively few indications of dogmatic\npurpose; and there are strong reasons for believing that the\nspeeches of Jesus recorded in it are in substance taken from the\ngenuine “Logia” of Matthew mentioned by Papias, which must have\nbeen written as early as A. D. 60-70, before the destruction of\nJerusalem. Indeed, we are inclined to agree with our author that\nthe gospel, even in its present shape (save only a few\ninterpolated passages), may have existed as early as A. D. 80,\nsince it places the time of Jesus’ second coming immediately\nafter the destruction of Jerusalem; whereas the third evangelist,\nwho wrote forty-five years after that event, is careful to tell\nus, “The end is NOT immediately.” Moreover, it must have been\nwritten while the Paulo-Petrine controversy was still raging, as\nis shown by the parable of the “enemy who sowed the tares,” which\nmanifestly refers to Paul, and also by the allusions to “false\nprophets” (vii. 15), to those who say “Lord, Lord,” and who “cast\nout demons in the name of the Lord” (vii. 21-23), teaching men to\nbreak the commandments (v. 17-20). There is, therefore, good\nreason for believing that we have here a narrative written not\nmuch more than fifty years after the death of Jesus, based partly\nupon the written memorials of an apostle, and in the main\ntrustworthy, save where it relates occurrences of a marvellous\nand legendary character. Such is our author’s conclusion, and in\ndescribing the career of the Jesus of history, he relies almost\nexclusively upon the statements contained in the first gospel.\nLet us now after this long but inadequate introduction, give a\nbrief sketch of the life of Jesus, as it is to be found in our\nauthor.",
        "Concerning the time and place of the birth of Jesus, we know next\nto nothing. According to uniform tradition, based upon a\nstatement of the third gospel, he was about thirty years of age\nat the time when he began teaching. The same gospel states, with\nelaborate precision, that the public career of John the Baptist\nbegan in the fifteenth year of Tiberius, or A. D. 28. In the\nwinter of A. D. 35-36, Pontius Pilate was recalled from Judaea,\nso that the crucifixion could not have taken place later than in\nthe spring of 35. Thus we have a period of about six years during\nwhich the ministry of Jesus must have begun and ended; and if the\ntradition with respect to his age be trustworthy, we shall not be\nfar out of the way in supposing him to have been born somewhere\nbetween B. C. 5 and A. D. 5. He is everywhere alluded to in the\ngospels as Jesus of Nazareth in Galilee, where lived also his\nfather, mother brothers and sisters, and where very likely he was\nborn. His parents’ names are said to have been Joseph and Mary.\nHis own name is a Hellenized form of Joshua, a name very common\namong the Jews. According to the first gospel (xiii. 55), he had\nfour brothers,—Joseph and Simon; James, who was afterwards one\nof the heads of the church at Jerusalem, and the most formidable\nenemy of Paul; and Judas or Jude, who is perhaps the author of\nthe anti-Pauline epistle commonly ascribed to him.",
        "Of the early youth of Jesus, and of the circumstances which\nguided his intellectual development, we know absolutely nothing,\nnor have we the data requisite for forming any plausible\nhypothesis. He first appears in history about A. D. 29 or 30, in\nconnection with a very remarkable person whom the third\nevangelist describes as his cousin, and who seems, from his mode\nof life, to have been in some way connected with or influenced by\nthe Hellenizing sect of Essenes. Here we obtain our first clew to\nguide us in forming a consecutive theory of the development of\nJesus’ opinions. The sect of Essenes took its rise in the time of\nthe Maccabees, about B. C. 170. Upon the fundamental doctrines of\nJudaism it had engrafted many Pythagorean notions, and was\ndoubtless in the time of Jesus instrumental in spreading Greek\nideas among the people of Galilee, where Judaism was far from\nbeing so narrow and rigid as at Jerusalem. The Essenes attached\nbut little importance to the Messianic expectations of the\nPharisees, and mingled scarcely at all in national politics. They\nlived for the most part a strictly ascetic life, being indeed the\nlegitimate predecessors of the early Christian hermits and monks.\nBut while pre-eminent for sanctity of life, they heaped ridicule\nupon the entire sacrificial service of the Temple, despised the\nPharisees as hypocrites, and insisted upon charity toward all men\ninstead of the old Jewish exclusiveness.",
        "It was once a favourite theory that both John the Baptist and\nJesus were members of the Essenian brotherhood; but that theory\nis now generally abandoned. Whatever may have been the case with\nJohn, who is said to have lived like an anchorite in the desert,\nthere seems to have been but little practical Essenism in Jesus,\nwho is almost uniformly represented as cheerful and social in\ndemeanour, and against whom it was expressly urged that he came\neating and drinking, making no presence of puritanical holiness.\nHe was neither a puritan, like the Essenes, nor a ritualist, like\nthe Pharisees. Besides which, both John and Jesus seem to have\nbegun their careers by preaching the un-Essene doctrine of the\nspeedy advent of the “kingdom of heaven,” by which is meant the\nreign of the Messiah upon the earth. Nevertheless, though we\ncannot regard Jesus as actually a member of the Essenian\ncommunity or sect, we can hardly avoid the conclusion that he, as\nwell as John the Baptist, had been at some time strongly\ninfluenced by Essenian doctrines. The spiritualized conception of\nthe “kingdom of heaven” proclaimed by him was just what would\nnaturally and logically arise from a remodelling of the Messianic\ntheories of the Pharisees in conformity to advanced Essenian\nnotions. It seems highly probable that some such refined\nconception of the functions of the Messiah was reached by John,\nwho, stigmatizing the Pharisees and Sadducees as a “generation of\nvipers,” called aloud to the people to repent of their sins, in\nview of the speedy advent of the Messiah, and to testify to their\nrepentance by submitting to the Essenian rite of baptism. There\nis no positive evidence that Jesus was ever a disciple of John;\nyet the account of the baptism, in spite of the legendary\ncharacter of its details, seems to rest upon a historical basis;\nand perhaps the most plausible hypothesis which can be framed is,\nthat Jesus received baptism at John’s hands, became for a while\nhis disciple, and acquired from him a knowledge of Essenian\ndoctrines.",
        "The career of John seems to have been very brief. His stern\npuritanism brought him soon into disgrace with the government of\nGalilee. He was seized by Herod, thrown into prison, and\nbeheaded. After the brief hints given as to the intercourse\nbetween Jesus and John, we next hear of Jesus alone in the\ndesert, where, like Sakyamuni and Mohammed, he may have brooded\nin solitude over his great project. Yet we do not find that he\nhad as yet formed any distinct conception of his own Messiahship.\nThe total neglect of chronology by our authorities[20] renders it\nimpossible to trace the development of his thoughts step by step;\nbut for some time after John’s catastrophe we find him calling\nupon the people to repent, in view of the speedy approach of the\nMessiah, speaking with great and commanding personal authority,\nbut using no language which would indicate that he was striving\nto do more than worthily fill the place and add to the good work\nof his late master. The Sermon on the Mount, which the first\ngospel inserts in this place, was perhaps never spoken as a\ncontinuous discourse; but it no doubt for the most part contains\nthe very words of Jesus, and represents the general spirit of his\nteaching during this earlier portion of his career. In this is\ncontained nearly all that has made Christianity so powerful in\nthe domain of ethics. If all the rest of the gospel were taken\naway, or destroyed in the night of some future barbarian\ninvasion, we should still here possess the secret of the\nwonderful impression which Jesus made upon those who heard him\nspeak. Added to the Essenian scorn of Pharisaic formalism, and\nthe spiritualized conception of the Messianic kingdom, which\nJesus may probably have shared with John the Baptist, we have\nhere for the first time the distinctively Christian conception of\nthe fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of men, which\nultimately insured the success of the new religion. The special\npoint of originality in Jesus was his conception of Deity. As\nStrauss well says, “He conceived of God, in a moral point of\nview, as being identical in character with himself in the most\nexalted moments of his religious life, and strengthened in turn\nhis own religious life by this ideal. But the most exalted\nreligious tendency in his own consciousness was exactly that\ncomprehensive love, overpowering the evil only by the good, which\nhe therefore transferred to God as the fundamental tendency of\nHis nature.” From this conception of God, observes Zeller, flowed\nnaturally all the moral teaching of Jesus, the insistence upon\nspiritual righteousness instead of the mere mechanical observance\nof Mosaic precepts, the call to be perfect even as the Father is\nperfect, the principle of the spiritual equality of men before\nGod, and the equal duties of all men toward each other.",
        "[20] “The biographers [of Becket] are commonly rather careless as\nto the order of time. Each .... recorded what struck him most or\nwhat he best knew, one set down one event and another; and none\nof them paid much regard to the order of details.\"—Freeman,\nHistorical Essays, 1st series, p. 94.",
        "How far, in addition to these vitally important lessons, Jesus\nmay have taught doctrines of an ephemeral or visionary character,\nit is very difficult to decide. We are inclined to regard the\nthird gospel as of some importance in settling this point. The\nauthor of that gospel represents Jesus as decidedly hostile to\nthe rich. Where Matthew has “Blessed are the poor in spirit,\"\nLuke has “Blessed are ye poor.” In the first gospel we read,\n\"Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for\nthey will be filled\"; but in the third gospel we find, “Blessed\nare ye that hunger now, for ye will be filled\"; and this\nassurance is immediately followed by the denunciation, “Woe to\nyou that are rich, for ye have received your consolation! Woe to\nyou that are full now, for ye will hunger.” The parable of Dives\nand Lazarus illustrates concretely this view of the case, which\nis still further corroborated by the account, given in both the\nfirst and the third gospels, of the young man who came to seek\neverlasting life. Jesus here maintains that righteousness is\ninsufficient unless voluntary poverty be superadded. Though the\nyoung man has strictly fulfilled the greatest of the\ncommandments,—to love his neighbour as himself,—he is required,\nas a needful proof of his sincerity, to distribute all his vast\npossessions among the poor. And when he naturally manifests a\nreluctance to perform so superfluous a sacrifice, Jesus observes\nthat it will be easier for a camel to go through the eye of a\nneedle than for a rich man to share in the glories of the\nanticipated Messianic kingdom. It is difficult to escape the\nconclusion that we have here a very primitive and probably\nauthentic tradition; and when we remember the importance which,\naccording to the “Acts,” the earliest disciples attached to the\nprinciple of communism, as illustrated in the legend of Ananias\nand Sapphira, we must admit strong reasons for believing that\nJesus himself held views which tended toward the abolition of\nprivate property. On this point, the testimony of the third\nevangelist singly is of considerable weight; since at the time\nwhen he wrote, the communistic theories of the first generation\nof Christians had been generally abandoned, and in the absence of\nany dogmatic motives, he could only have inserted these\nparticular traditions because he believed them to possess\nhistorical value. But we are not dependent on the third gospel\nalone. The story just cited is attested by both our authorities,\nand is in perfect keeping with the general views of Jesus as\nreported by the first evangelist. Thus his disciples are enjoined\nto leave all, and follow him; to take no thought for the morrow;\nto think no more of laying up treasures on the earth, for in the\nMessianic kingdom they shall have treasures in abundance, which\ncan neither be wasted nor stolen. On making their journeys, they\nare to provide neither money, nor clothes, nor food, but are to\nlive at the expense of those whom they visit; and if any town\nrefuse to harbour them, the Messiah, on his arrival, will deal\nwith that town more severely than Jehovah dealt with the cities\nof the plain. Indeed, since the end of the world was to come\nbefore the end of the generation then living (Matt. xxiv. 34; 1\nCor. xv. 51-56, vii. 29), there could be no need for acquiring\nproperty or making arrangements for the future; even marriage\nbecame unnecessary. These teachings of Jesus have a marked\nEssenian character, as well as his declaration that in the\nMessianic kingdom there was to be no more marriage, perhaps no\ndistinction of sex (Matt. xxii. 30). The sect of Ebionites, who\nrepresented the earliest doctrine and practice of Christianity\nbefore it had been modified by Paul, differed from the Essenes in\nno essential respect save in the acknowledgment of Jesus as the\nMessiah, and the expectation of his speedy return to the earth.",
        "How long, or with what success, Jesus continued to preach the\ncoming of the Messiah in Galilee, it is impossible to conjecture.\nHis fellow-townsmen of Nazareth appear to have ridiculed him in\nhis prophetical capacity; or, if we may trust the third\nevangelist, to have arisen against him with indignation, and made\nan attempt upon his life. To them he was but a carpenter, the son\nof a carpenter (Matt. xiii. 55; Mark vi. 3), who told them\ndisagreeable truths. Our author represents his teaching in\nGalilee to have produced but little result, but the gospel\nnarratives afford no definite data for deciding this point. We\nbelieve the most probable conclusion to be that Jesus did attract\nmany followers, and became famous throughout Galilee; for Herod\nis said to have regarded him as John the Baptist risen from the\ngrave. To escape the malice of Herod, Jesus then retired to\nSyro-Phoenicia, and during this eventful journey the\nconsciousness of his own Messiahship seems for the first time to\nhave distinctly dawned upon him (Matt. xiv. 1, 13; xv. 21; xvi.\n13-20). Already, it appears, speculations were rife as to the\ncharacter of this wonderful preacher. Some thought he was John\nthe Baptist, or perhaps one of the prophets of the Assyrian\nperiod returned to the earth. Some, in accordance with a\ngenerally-received tradition, supposed him to be Elijah, who had\nnever seen death, and had now at last returned from the regions\nabove the firmament to announce the coming of the Messiah in the\nclouds. It was generally admitted, among enthusiastic hearers,\nthat he who spake as never man spake before must have some divine\ncommission to execute. These speculations, coming to the ears of\nJesus during his preaching in Galilee, could not fail to excite\nin him a train of self-conscious reflections. To him also must\nhave been presented the query as to his own proper character and\nfunctions; and, as our author acutely demonstrates, his only\nchoice lay between a profitless life of exile in Syro-Phoenicia,\nand a bold return to Jewish territory in some pronounced\ncharacter. The problem being thus propounded, there could hardly\nbe a doubt as to what that character should be. Jesus knew well\nthat he was not John the Baptist; nor, however completely he may\nhave been dominated by his sublime enthusiasm, was it likely that\nhe could mistake himself for an ancient prophet arisen from the\nlower world of shades, or for Elijah descended from the sky. But\nthe Messiah himself he might well be. Such indeed was the almost\ninevitable corollary from his own conception of Messiahship. We\nhave seen that he had, probably from the very outset, discarded\nthe traditional notion of a political Messiah, and recognized the\ntruth that the happiness of a people lies not so much in\npolitical autonomy as in the love of God and the sincere practice\nof righteousness. The people were to be freed from the bondage of\nsin, of meaningless formalism, of consecrated hypocrisy,—a\nbondage more degrading than the payment of tribute to the\nemperor. The true business of the Messiah, then, was to deliver\nhis people from the former bondage; it might be left to Jehovah,\nin his own good time, to deliver them from the latter. Holding\nthese views, it was hardly possible that it should not sooner or\nlater occur to Jesus that he himself was the person destined to\ndischarge this glorious function, to liberate his countrymen from\nthe thraldom of Pharisaic ritualism, and to inaugurate the real\nMessianic kingdom of spiritual righteousness. Had he not already\npreached the advent of this spiritual kingdom, and been\ninstrumental in raising many to loftier conceptions of duty, and\nto a higher and purer life? And might he not now, by a grand\nattack upon Pharisaism in its central stronghold, destroy its\nprestige in the eyes of the people, and cause Israel to adopt a\nnobler religious and ethical doctrine? The temerity of such a\npurpose detracts nothing from its sublimity. And if that purpose\nshould be accomplished, Jesus would really have performed the\nlegitimate work of the Messiah. Thus, from his own point of view,\nJesus was thoroughly consistent and rational in announcing\nhimself as the expected Deliverer; and in the eyes of the\nimpartial historian his course is fully justified.",
        "“From that time,” says the first evangelist, “Jesus began to show\nto his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many\nthings from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be put\nto death, and rise again on the third day.” Here we have,\nobviously, the knowledge of the writer, after the event,\nreflected back and attributed to Jesus. It is of course\nimpossible that Jesus should have predicted with such\ndefiniteness his approaching death; nor is it very likely that he\nentertained any hope of being raised from the grave “on the third\nday.” To a man in that age and country, the conception of a\nreturn from the lower world of shades was not a difficult one to\nframe; and it may well be that Jesus’ sense of his own exalted\nposition was sufficiently great to inspire him with the\nconfidence that, even in case of temporary failure, Jehovah would\nrescue him from the grave and send him back with larger powers to\ncarry out the purpose of his mission. But the difficulty of\ndistinguishing between his own words and the interpretation put\nupon them by his disciples becomes here insuperable; and there\nwill always be room for the hypothesis that Jesus had in view no\nposthumous career of his own, but only expressed his unshaken\nconfidence in the success of his enterprise, even after and in\nspite of his death.",
        "At all events, the possibility of his death must now have been\noften in his mind. He was undertaking a wellnigh desperate\ntask,—to overthrow the Pharisees in Jerusalem itself. No other\nalternative was left him. And here we believe Mr. F. W. Newman to\nbe singularly at fault in pronouncing this attempt of Jesus upon\nJerusalem a foolhardy attempt. According to Mr. Newman, no man\nhas any business to rush upon certain death, and it is only a\ncrazy fanatic who will do so.[21] But such “glittering\ngeneralizations” will here help us but little. The historic data\nshow that to go to Jerusalem, even at the risk of death, was\nabsolutely necessary to the realization of Jesus’ Messianic\nproject. Mr. Newman certainly would not have had him drag out an\ninglorious and baffled existence in Syro-Phoenicia. If the\nMessianic kingdom was to be fairly inaugurated, there was work to\nbe done in Jerusalem, and Jesus must go there as one in\nauthority, cost what it might. We believe him to have gone there\nin a spirit of grand and careless bravery, yet seriously and\nsoberly, and under the influence of no fanatical delusion. He\nknew the risks, but deliberately chose to incur them, that the\nwill of Jehovah might be accomplished.",
        "We next hear of Jesus travelling down to Jerusalem by way of\nJericho, and entering the sacred city in his character of\nMessiah, attended by a great multitude. It was near the time of\nthe Passover, when people from all parts of Galilee and Judaea\nwere sure to be at Jerusalem, and the nature of his reception\nseems to indicate that he had already secured a considerable\nnumber of followers upon whose assistance he might hope to rely,\nthough it nowhere appears that he intended to use other than\npurely moral weapons to insure a favourable reception. We must\nremember that for half a century many of the Jewish people had\nbeen constantly looking for the arrival of the Messiah, and there\ncan be little doubt that the entry of Jesus riding upon an ass in\nliteral fulfilment of prophecy must have wrought powerfully upon\nthe imagination of the multitude. That the believers in him were\nvery numerous must be inferred from the cautious, not to say\ntimid, behaviour of the rulers at Jerusalem, who are represented\nas desiring to arrest him, but as deterred from taking active\nsteps through fear of the people. We are led to the same\nconclusion by his driving the money-changers out of the Temple;\nan act upon which he could hardly have ventured, had not the\npopular enthusiasm in his favour been for the moment\noverwhelming. But the enthusiasm of a mob is short-lived, and\nneeds to be fed upon the excitement of brilliant and dramatically\narranged events. The calm preacher of righteousness, or even the\nfiery denouncer of the scribes and Pharisees, could not hope to\nretain undiminished authority save by the display of\nextraordinary powers to which, so far as we know, Jesus (like\nMohammed) made no presence (Matt. xvi. 1-4). The ignorant and\nmaterialistic populace could not understand the exalted\nconception of Messiahship which had been formed by Jesus, and as\nday after day elapsed without the appearance of any marvellous\nsign from Jehovah, their enthusiasm must naturally have cooled\ndown. Then the Pharisees appear cautiously endeavouring to entrap\nhim into admissions which might render him obnoxious to the Roman\ngovernor. He saw through their design, however, and foiled them\nby the magnificent repartee, “Render unto Caesar the things that\nare Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.” Nothing\ncould more forcibly illustrate the completely non-political\ncharacter of his Messianic doctrines. Nevertheless, we are told\nthat, failing in this attempt, the chief priests suborned false\nwitnesses to testify against him: this Sabbath-breaker, this\nderider of Mosaic formalism, who with his Messianic pretensions\nexcited the people against their hereditary teachers, must at all\nevents be put out of the way. Jesus must suffer the fate which\nsociety has too often had in store for the reformer; the fate\nwhich Sokrates and Savonarola, Vanini and Bruno, have suffered\nfor being wiser than their own generation. Messianic adventurers\nhad already given much trouble to the Roman authorities, who were\nnot likely to scrutinize critically the peculiar claims of Jesus.\nAnd when the chief priests accused him before Pilate of\nprofessing to be “King of the Jews,” this claim could in Roman\napprehension bear but one interpretation. The offence was\ntreason, punishable, save in the case of Roman citizens, by\ncrucifixion.",
        "[21] Phases of Faith, pp. 158-164.",
        "Such in its main outlines is the historic career of Jesus, as\nconstructed by our author from data furnished chiefly by the\nfirst gospel. Connected with the narrative there are many\ninteresting topics of discussion, of which our rapidly\ndiminishing space will allow us to select only one for comment.\nThat one is perhaps the most important of all, namely, the\nquestion as to how far Jesus anticipated the views of Paul in\nadmitting Gentiles to share in the privileges of the Messianic\nkingdom. Our author argues, with much force, that the designs of\nJesus were entirely confined to the Jewish people, and that it\nwas Paul who first, by admitting Gentiles to the Christian fold\nwithout requiring them to live like Jews, gave to Christianity\nthe character of a universal religion. Our author reminds us that\nthe third gospel is not to be depended upon in determining this\npoint, since it manifestly puts Pauline sentiments into the mouth\nof Jesus, and in particular attributes to Jesus an acquaintance\nwith heretical Samaria which the first gospel disclaims. He\nargues that the apostles were in every respect Jews, save in\ntheir belief that Jesus was the Messiah; and he pertinently asks,\nif James, who was the brother of Jesus, and Peter and John, who\nwere his nearest friends, unanimously opposed Paul and\nstigmatized him as a liar and heretic, is it at all likely that\nJesus had ever distinctly sanctioned such views as Paul\nmaintained?",
        "In the course of many years’ reflection upon this point, we have\nseveral times been inclined to accept the narrow interpretation\nof Jesus’ teaching here indicated; yet, on the whole, we do not\nbelieve it can ever be conclusively established. In the first\nplace it must be remembered that if the third gospel throws a\nPauline colouring over the events which it describes, the first\ngospel also shows a decidedly anti-Pauline bias, and the one\nparty was as likely as the other to attribute its own views to\nJesus himself. One striking instance of this tendency has been\npointed out by Strauss, who has shown that the verses Matt. v.\n17-20 are an interpolation. The person who teaches men to break\nthe commandments is undoubtedly Paul, and in order to furnish a\ntext against Paul’s followers, the “Nicolaitans,” Jesus is made\nto declare that he came not to destroy one tittle of the law, but\nto fulfil the whole in every particular. Such an utterance is in\nmanifest contradiction to the spirit of Jesus’ teaching, as shown\nin the very same chapter, and throughout a great part of the same\ngospel. He who taught in his own name and not as the scribes, who\nproclaimed himself Lord over the Sabbath, and who manifested from\nfirst to last a more than Essenian contempt for rites and\nceremonies, did not come to fulfil the law of Mosaism, but to\nsupersede it. Nor can any inference adverse to this conclusion be\ndrawn from the injunction to the disciples (Matt. x. 5-7) not to\npreach to Gentiles and Samaritans, but only “to the lost sheep of\nthe house of Israel\"; for this remark is placed before the\nbeginning of Jesus’ Messianic career, and the reason assigned for\nthe restriction is merely that the disciples will not have time\neven to preach to all the Jews before the coming of the Messiah,\nwhose approach Jesus was announcing (Matt. x. 23)",
        "These examples show that we must use caution in weighing the\ntestimony even of the first gospel, and must not too hastily cite\nit as proof that Jesus supposed his mission to be restricted to\nthe Jews. When we come to consider what happened a few years\nafter the death of Jesus, we shall be still less ready to insist\nupon the view defended by our anonymous author. Paul, according\nto his own confession, persecuted the Christians unto death. Now\nwhat, in the theories or in the practice of the Jewish disciples\nof Jesus, could have moved Paul to such fanatic behaviour?\nCertainly not their spiritual interpretation of Mosaism, for Paul\nhimself belonged to the liberal school of Gamaliel, to the views\nof which the teachings and practices of Peter, James, and John\nmight easily be accommodated. Probably not their belief in Jesus\nas the Messiah, for at the riot in which Stephen was murdered and\nall the Hellenist disciples driven from Jerusalem, the Jewish\ndisciples were allowed to remain in the city unmolested. (See\nActs viii. 1, 14.) This marked difference of treatment indicates\nthat Paul regarded Stephen and his friends as decidedly more\nheretical and obnoxious than Peter, James, and John, whom,\nindeed, Paul’s own master Gamaliel had recently (Acts v. 34)\ndefended before the council. And this inference is fully\nconfirmed by the account of Stephen’s death, where his murderers\ncharge him with maintaining that Jesus had founded a new religion\nwhich was destined entirely to supersede and replace Judaism\n(Acts vi. 14). The Petrine disciples never held this view of the\nmission of Jesus; and to this difference it is undoubtedly owing\nthat Paul and his companions forbore to disturb them. It would\nthus appear that even previous to Paul’s conversion, within five\nor six years after the death of Jesus, there was a prominent\nparty among the disciples which held that the new religion was\nnot a modification but an abrogation of Judaism; and their name\n\"Hellenists” sufficiently shows either that there were Gentiles\namong them or that they held fellowship with Gentiles. It was\nthis which aroused Paul to persecution, and upon his sudden\nconversion it was with these Hellenistic doctrines that he\nfraternized, taking little heed of the Petrine disciples\n(Galatians i. 17), who were hardly more than a Jewish sect.",
        "Now the existence of these Hellenists at Jerusalem so soon after\nthe death of Jesus is clear proof that he had never distinctly\nand irrevocably pronounced against the admission of Gentiles to\nthe Messianic kingdom, and it makes it very probable that the\ndownfall of Mosaism as a result of his preaching was by no means\nunpremeditated. While, on the other hand, the obstinacy of the\nPetrine party in adhering to Jewish customs shows equally that\nJesus could not have unequivocally committed himself in favour of\na new gospel for the Gentiles. Probably Jesus was seldom brought\ninto direct contact with others than Jews, so that the questions\nconcerning the admission of Gentile converts did not come up\nduring his lifetime; and thus the way was left open for the\ncontroversy which soon broke out between the Petrine party and\nPaul. Nevertheless, though Jesus may never have definitely\npronounced upon this point, it will hardly be denied that his\nteaching, even as reported in the first gospel, is in its utter\ncondemnation of formalism far more closely allied to the Pauline\nthan to the Petrine doctrines. In his hands Mosaism became\nspiritualized until it really lost its identity, and was\ntransformed into a code fit for the whole Roman world. And we do\nnot doubt that if any one had asked Jesus whether circumcision\nwere an essential prerequisite for admission to the Messianic\nkingdom, he would have given the same answer which Paul\nafterwards gave. We agree with Zeller and Strauss that, “as\nLuther was a more liberal spirit than the Lutheran divines of the\nsucceeding generation, and Sokrates a more profound thinker than\nXenophon or Antisthenes, so also Jesus must be credited with\nhaving raised himself far higher above the narrow prejudices of\nhis nation than those of his disciples who could scarcely\nunderstand the spread of Christianity among the heathen when it\nhad become an accomplished fact.”",

        "The meagreness of our information concerning the historic career\nof Jesus stands in striking contrast with the mass of information\nwhich lies within our reach concerning the primitive character of\nChristologic speculation. First we have the four epistles of\nPaul, written from twenty to thirty years after the crucifixion,\nwhich, although they tell us next to nothing about what Jesus\ndid, nevertheless give us very plain information as to the\nimpression which he made. Then we have the Apocalypse, written by\nJohn, A. D. 68, which exhibits the Messianic theory entertained\nby the earliest disciples. Next we have the epistles to the\nHebrews, Philippians, Colossians, and Ephesians, besides the four\ngospels, constituting altogether a connected chain of testimony\nto the progress of Christian doctrine from the destruction of\nJerusalem to the time of the Quartodeciman controversy (A. D.\n70-170). Finally, there is the vast collection of apocryphal,\nheretical, and patristic literature, from the writings of Justin\nMartyr, the pseudo-Clement, and the pseudo-Ignatius, down to the\ntime of the Council of Nikaia, when the official theories of\nChrist’s person assumed very nearly the shape which they have\nretained, within the orthodox churches of Christendom, down to\nthe present day. As we pointed out in the foregoing essay, while\nall this voluminous literature throws but an uncertain light upon\nthe life and teachings of the founder of Christianity, it\nnevertheless furnishes nearly all the data which we could desire\nfor knowing what the early Christians thought of the master of\ntheir faith. Having given a brief account of the historic career\nof Jesus, so far as it can now be determined, we propose here to\nsketch the rise and progress of Christologic doctrine, in its\nmost striking features, during the first three centuries.\nBeginning with the apostolic view of the human Messiah sent to\ndeliver Judaism from its spiritual torpor, and prepare it for the\nmillennial kingdom, we shall briefly trace the progressive\nmetamorphosis of this conception until it completely loses its\nidentity in the Athanasian theory, according to which Jesus was\nGod himself, the Creator of the universe, incarnate in human\nflesh.",
        "The earliest dogma held by the apostles concerning Jesus was that\nof his resurrection from the grave after death. It was not only\nthe earliest, but the most essential to the success of the new\nreligion. Christianity might have overspread the Roman Empire,\nand maintained its hold upon men’s faith until to-day, without\nthe dogmas of the incarnation and the Trinity; but without the\ndogma of the resurrection it would probably have failed at the\nvery outset. Its lofty morality would not alone have sufficed to\ninsure its success. For what men needed then, as indeed they\nstill need, and will always need, was not merely a rule of life\nand a mirror to the heart, but also a comprehensive and\nsatisfactory theory of things, a philosophy or theosophy. The\ntimes demanded intellectual as well as moral consolation; and the\ndisintegration of ancient theologies needed to be repaired, that\nthe new ethical impulse imparted by Christianity might rest upon\na plausible speculative basis. The doctrine of the resurrection\nwas but the beginning of a series of speculative innovations\nwhich prepared the way for the new religion to emancipate itself\nfrom Judaism, and achieve the conquest of the Empire. Even the\nfaith of the apostles in the speedy return of their master the\nMessiah must have somewhat lost ground, had it not been supported\nby their belief in his resurrection from the grave and his\nconsequent transfer from Sheol, the gloomy land of shadows, to\nthe regions above the sky.",
        "The origin of the dogma of the resurrection cannot be determined\nwith certainty. The question has, during the past century, been\nthe subject of much discussion, upon which it is not necessary\nfor us here to comment. Such apparent evidence as there is in\nfavour of the old theory of Jesus’ natural recovery from the\neffects of the crucifixion may be found in Salvador’s\n\"Jesus-Christ et sa Doctrine\"; but, as Zeller has shown, the\ntheory is utterly unsatisfactory. The natural return of Jesus to\nhis disciples never could have given rise to the notion of his\nresurrection, since the natural explanation would have been the\nmore obvious one; besides which, if we were to adopt this\nhypothesis, we should be obliged to account for the fact that the\nhistoric career of Jesus ends with the crucifixion. The most\nprobable explanation, on the whole, is the one suggested by the\naccounts in the gospels, that the dogma of the resurrection is\ndue originally to the excited imagination of Mary of Magdala.[23]\nThe testimony of Paul may also be cited in favour of this view,\nsince he always alludes to earlier Christophanies in just the\nsame language which he uses in describing his own vision on the\nroad to Damascus.",
        "[23] See Taine, De l’Intelligence, II. 192.",
        "But the question as to how the belief in the resurrection of\nJesus originated is of less importance than the question as to\nhow it should have produced the effect that it did. The dogma of\nthe resurrection has, until recent times, been so rarely treated\nfrom the historical point of view, that the student of history at\nfirst finds some difficulty in thoroughly realizing its import to\nthe minds of those who first proclaimed it. We cannot hope to\nunderstand it without bearing in mind the theories of the Jews\nand early Christians concerning the structure of the world and\nthe cosmic location of departed souls. Since the time of\nCopernicus modern Christians no longer attempt to locate heaven\nand hell; they are conceived merely as mysterious places remote\nfrom the earth. The theological universe no longer corresponds to\nthat which physical science presents for our contemplation. It\nwas quite different with the Jew. His conception of the abode of\nJehovah and the angels, and of departed souls, was exceedingly\nsimple and definite. In the Jewish theory the universe is like a\nsort of three-story house. The flat earth rests upon the waters,\nand under the earth’s surface is the land of graves, called\nSheol, where after death the souls of all men go, the righteous\nas well as the wicked, for the Jew had not arrived at the\ndoctrine of heaven and hell. The Hebrew Sheol corresponds\nstrictly to the Greek Hades, before the notions of Elysium and\nTartarus were added to it,—a land peopled with flitting shadows,\nsuffering no torment, but experiencing no pleasure, like those\nwhom Dante met in one of the upper circles of his Inferno. Sheol\nis the first story of the cosmic house; the earth is the second.\nAbove the earth is the firmament or sky, which, according to the\nbook of Genesis (chap. i. v. 6, Hebrew text), is a vast plate\nhammered out by the gods, and supports a great ocean like that\nupon which the earth rests. Rain is caused by the opening of\nlittle windows or trap-doors in the firmament, through which\npours the water of this upper ocean. Upon this water rests the\nland of heaven, where Jehovah reigns, surrounded by hosts of\nangels. To this blessed land two only of the human race had ever\nbeen admitted,—Enoch and Elijah, the latter of whom had ascended\nin a chariot of fire, and was destined to return to earth as the\nherald and forerunner of the Messiah. Heaven forms the third\nstory of the cosmic house. Between the firmament and the earth is\nthe air, which is the habitation of evil demons ruled by Satan,\nthe “prince of the powers of the air.”",
        "Such was the cosmology of the ancient Jew; and his theology was\nequally simple. Sheol was the destined abode of all men after\ndeath, and no theory of moral retribution was attached to the\nconception. The rewards and punishments known to the authors of\nthe Pentateuch and the early Psalms are all earthly rewards and\npunishments. But in course of time the prosperity of the wicked\nand the misfortunes of the good man furnished a troublesome\nproblem for the Jewish thinker; and after the Babylonish\nCaptivity, we find the doctrine of a resurrection from Sheol\ndevised in order to meet this case. According to this\ndoctrine—which was borrowed from the Zarathustrian theology of\nPersia—the Messiah on his arrival was to free from Sheol all the\nsouls of the righteous, causing them to ascend reinvested in\ntheir bodies to a renewed and beautiful earth, while on the other\nhand the wicked were to be punished with tortures like those of\nthe valley of Hinnom, or were to be immersed in liquid brimstone,\nlike that which had rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah. Here we get\nthe first announcement of a future state of retribution. The\ndoctrine was peculiarly Pharisaic, and the Sadducees, who were\nstrict adherents to the letter of Mosaism, rejected it to the\nlast. By degrees this doctrine became coupled with the Messianic\ntheories of the Pharisees. The loss of Jewish independence under\nthe dominion of Persians, Macedonians, and Romans, caused the\npeople to look ever more earnestly toward the expected time when\nthe Messiah should appear in Jerusalem to deliver them from their\noppressors. The moral doctrines of the Psalms and earlier\nprophets assumed an increasingly political aspect. The Jews were\nthe righteous “under a cloud,” whose sufferings were symbolically\ndepicted by the younger Isaiah as the afflictions of the “servant\nof Jehovah\"; while on the other hand, the “wicked” were the\nGentile oppressors of the holy people. Accordingly the Messiah,\non his arrival, was to sit in judgment in the valley of\nJehoshaphat, rectifying the wrongs of his chosen ones, condemning\nthe Gentile tyrants to the torments of Gehenna, and raising from\nSheol all those Jews who had lived and died during the evil times\nbefore his coming. These were to find in the Messianic kingdom\nthe compensation for the ills which they had suffered in their\nfirst earthly existence. Such are the main outlines of the theory\nfound in the Book of Enoch, written about B. C. 100, and it is\nadopted in the Johannine Apocalypse, with little variation, save\nin the recognition of Jesus as the Messiah, and in the\ntransferrence to his second coming of all these wonderful\nproceedings. The manner of the Messiah’s coming had been\nvariously imagined. According to an earlier view, he was to enter\nJerusalem as a King of the house of David, and therefore of human\nlineage. According to a later view, presented in the Book of\nDaniel, he was to descend from the sky, and appear among the\nclouds. Both these views were adopted by the disciples of Jesus,\nwho harmonized them by referring the one to his first and the\nother to his second appearance.",
        "Now to the imaginations of these earliest disciples the belief in\nthe resurrection of Jesus presented itself as a needful guarantee\nof his Messiahship. Their faith, which must have been shaken by\nhis execution and descent into Sheol, received welcome\nconfirmation by the springing up of the belief that he had been\nagain seen upon the face of the earth. Applying the imagery of\nDaniel, it became a logical conclusion that he must have ascended\ninto the sky, whence he might shortly be expected to make his\nappearance, to enact the scenes foretold in prophecy. That such\nwas the actual process of inference is shown by the legend of the\nAscension in the first chapter of the “Acts,” and especially by\nthe words, “This Jesus who hath been taken up from you into\nheaven, will come in the same manner in which ye beheld him going\ninto heaven.” In the Apocalypse, written A. D. 68, just after the\ndeath of Nero, this second coming is described as something\nimmediately to happen, and the colours in which it is depicted\nshow how closely allied were the Johannine notions to those of\nthe Pharisees. The glories of the New Jerusalem are to be\nreserved for Jews, while for the Roman tyrants of Judaea is\nreserved a fearful retribution. They are to be trodden underfoot\nby the Messiah, like grapes in a wine-press, until the gushing\nblood shall rise to the height of the horse’s bridle.",
        "In the writings of Paul the dogma of the resurrection assumes a\nvery different aspect. Though Paul, like the older apostles, held\nthat Jesus, as the Messiah, was to return to the earth within a\nfew years, yet to his catholic mind this anticipated event had\nbecome divested of its narrow Jewish significance. In the eyes of\nPaul, the religion preached by Jesus was an abrogation of\nMosaism, and the truths contained in it were a free gift to the\nGentile as well as to the Jewish world. According to Paul, death\ncame into the world as a punishment for the sin of Adam. By this\nhe meant that, had it not been for the original transgression,\nall men escaping death would either have remained upon earth or\nhave been conveyed to heaven, like Enoch and Elijah, in\nincorruptible bodies. But in reality as a penance for\ndisobedience, all men, with these two exceptions, had suffered\ndeath, and been exiled to the gloomy caverns of Sheol. The Mosaic\nritual was powerless to free men from this repulsive doom, but it\nhad nevertheless served a good purpose in keeping men’s minds\ndirected toward holiness, preparing them, as a schoolmaster would\nprepare his pupils, to receive the vitalizing truths of Christ.\nNow, at last, the Messiah or Christ had come as a second Adam,\nand being without sin had been raised by Jehovah out of Sheol and\ntaken up into heaven, as testimony to men that the power of sin\nand death was at last defeated. The way henceforth to avoid death\nand escape the exile to Sheol was to live spiritually like Jesus,\nand with him to be dead to sensual requirements. Faith, in Paul’s\napprehension, was not an intellectual assent to definitely\nprescribed dogmas, but, as Matthew Arnold has well pointed out,\nit was an emotional striving after righteousness, a developing\nconsciousness of God in the soul, such as Jesus had possessed,\nor, in Paul’s phraseology, a subjugation of the flesh by the\nspirit. All those who should thus seek spiritual perfection\nshould escape the original curse. The Messiah was destined to\nreturn to the earth to establish the reign of spiritual holiness,\nprobably during Paul’s own lifetime (1 Cor. xv. 51). Then the\ntrue followers of Jesus should be clothed in ethereal bodies,\nfree from the imperfections of “the flesh,” and should ascend to\nheaven without suffering death, while the righteous dead should\nat the same time be released from Sheol, even as Jesus himself\nhad been released.",
        "To the doctrine of the resurrection, in which ethical and\nspeculative elements are thus happily blended by Paul, the new\nreligion doubtless owed in great part its rapid success. Into an\naccount of the causes which favoured the spreading of\nChristianity, it is not our purpose to enter at present. But we\nmay note that the local religions of the ancient pagan world had\npartly destroyed each other by mutual intermingling, and had lost\ntheir hold upon people from the circumstance that their ethical\nteaching no longer corresponded to the advanced ethical feeling\nof the age. Polytheism, in short, was outgrown. It was outgrown\nboth intellectually and morally. People were ceasing to believe\nin its doctrines, and were ceasing to respect its precepts. The\nlearned were taking refuge in philosophy, the ignorant in\nmystical superstitions imported from Asia. The commanding ethical\nmotive of ancient republican times had been patriotism,—devotion\nto the interests of the community. But Roman dominion had\ndestroyed patriotism as a guiding principle of life, and thus in\nevery way the minds of men were left in a sceptical, unsatisfied\nstate,—craving after a new theory of life, and craving after a\nnew stimulus to right action. Obviously the only theology which\ncould now be satisfactory to philosophy or to common-sense was\nsome form of monotheism;—some system of doctrines which should\nrepresent all men as spiritually subjected to the will of a\nsingle God, just as they were subjected to the temporal authority\nof the Emperor. And similarly the only system of ethics which\ncould have a chance of prevailing must be some system which\nshould clearly prescribe the mutual duties of all men without\ndistinction of race or locality. Thus the spiritual morality of\nJesus, and his conception of God as a father and of all men as\nbrothers, appeared at once to meet the ethical and speculative\ndemands of the time.",
        "Yet whatever effect these teachings might have produced, if\nunaided by further doctrinal elaboration, was enhanced myriadfold\nby the elaboration which they received at the hands of Paul.\nPhilosophic Stoics and Epicureans had arrived at the conception\nof the brotherhood of men, and the Greek hymn of Kleanthes had\nexhibited a deep spiritual sense of the fatherhood of God. The\noriginality of Christianity lay not so much in its enunciation of\nnew ethical precepts as in the fact that it furnished a new\nethical sanction,—a commanding incentive to holiness of living.\nThat it might accomplish this result, it was absolutely necessary\nthat it should begin by discarding both the ritualism and the\nnarrow theories of Judaism. The mere desire for a monotheistic\ncreed had led many pagans, in Paul’s time, to embrace Judaism, in\nspite of its requirements, which to Romans and Greeks were\nmeaningless, and often disgusting; but such conversions could\nnever have been numerous. Judaism could never have conquered the\nRoman world; nor is it likely that the Judaical Christianity of\nPeter, James, and John would have been any more successful. The\ndoctrine of the resurrection, in particular, was not likely to\nprove attractive when accompanied by the picture of the Messiah\ntreading the Gentiles in the wine-press of his righteous\nindignation. But here Paul showed his profound originality The\ncondemnation of Jewish formalism which Jesus had pronounced, Paul\nturned against the older apostles, who insisted upon\ncircumcision. With marvellous flexibility of mind, Paul placed\ncircumcision and the Mosaic injunctions about meats upon a level\nwith the ritual observances of pagan nations, allowing each\nfeeble brother to perform such works as might tickle his fancy,\nbut bidding all take heed that salvation was not to be obtained\nafter any such mechanical method, but only by devoting the whole\nsoul to righteousness, after the example of Jesus.",
        "This was the negative part of Paul’s work. This was the knocking\ndown of the barriers which had kept men, and would always have\nkept them, from entering into the kingdom of heaven. But the\npositive part of Paul’s work is contained in his theory of the\nsalvation of men from death through the second Adam, whom Jehovah\nrescued from Sheol for his sinlessness. The resurrection of Jesus\nwas the visible token of the escape from death which might be\nachieved by all men who, with God’s aid, should succeed in\nfreeing themselves from the burden of sin which had encumbered\nall the children of Adam. The end of the world was at hand, and\nthey who would live with Christ must figuratively die with\nChrist, must become dead to sin. Thus to the pure and spiritual\nethics contained in the teachings of Jesus, Paul added an\nincalculably powerful incentive to right action, and a theory of\nlife calculated to satisfy the speculative necessities of the\npagan or Gentile world. To the educated and sceptical Athenian,\nas to the critical scholar of modern times, the physical\nresurrection of Jesus from the grave, and his ascent through the\nvaulted floor of heaven, might seem foolishness or naivete. But\nto the average Greek or Roman the conception presented no serious\ndifficulty. The cosmical theories upon which the conception was\nfounded were essentially the same among Jews and Gentiles, and\nindeed were but little modified until the establishment of the\nCopernican astronomy. The doctrine of the Messiah’s second coming\nwas also received without opposition, and for about a century men\nlived in continual anticipation of that event, until hope long\ndeferred produced its usual results; the writings in which that\nevent was predicted were gradually explained away, ignored, or\nstigmatized as uncanonical; and the Church ended by condemning as\na heresy the very doctrine which Paul and the Judaizing apostles,\nwho agreed in little else, had alike made the basis of their\nspeculative teachings. Nevertheless, by the dint of allegorical\ninterpretation, the belief has maintained an obscure existence\neven down to the present time; the Antiochus of the Book of\nDaniel and the Nero of the Apocalypse having given place to the\nRoman Pontiff or to the Emperor of the French.",
        "But as the millenarism of the primitive Church gradually died out\nduring the second century, the essential principles involved in\nit lost none of their hold on men’s minds. As the generation\ncontemporary with Paul died away and was gathered into Sheol, it\nbecame apparent that the original theory must be somewhat\nmodified, and to this question the author of the second epistle\nto the Thessalonians addresses himself. Instead of literal\npreservation from death, the doctrine of a resurrection from the\ngrave was gradually extended to the case of the new believers,\nwho were to share in the same glorious revival with the righteous\nof ancient times. And thus by slow degrees the victory over\ndeath, of which the resurrection of Jesus was a symbol and a\nwitness, became metamorphosed into the comparatively modern\ndoctrine of the rest of the saints in heaven, while the\nbanishment of the unrighteous to Sheol was made still more\ndreadful by coupling with the vague conception of a gloomy\nsubterranean cavern the horrible imagery of the lake of fire and\nbrimstone borrowed from the apocalyptic descriptions of Gehenna.\nBut in this modification of the original theory, the fundamental\nidea of a future state of retribution was only the more\ndistinctly emphasized; although, in course of time, the original\nincentive to righteousness supplied by Paul was more and more\nsubordinated to the comparatively degrading incentive involved in\nthe fear of damnation. There can hardly be a doubt that the\ndefiniteness and vividness of the Pauline theory of a future life\ncontributed very largely to the rapid spread of the Christian\nreligion; nor can it be doubted that to the desire to be holy\nlike Jesus, in order to escape death and live with Jesus, is due\nthe elevating ethical influence which, even in the worst times of\necclesiastic degeneracy, Christianity has never failed to exert.\nDoubtless, as Lessing long, ago observed, the notion of future\nreward and punishment needs to be eliminated in order that the\nincentive to holiness may be a perfectly pure one. The highest\nvirtue is that which takes no thought of reward or punishment;\nbut for a conception of this sort the mind of antiquity was not\nready, nor is the average mind of to-day yet ready; and the\nsudden or premature dissolution of the Christian theory—which is\nfortunately impossible—might perhaps entail a moral\nretrogradation.",
        "The above is by no means intended as a complete outline of the\nreligious philosophy of Paul. We have aimed only at a clear\ndefinition of the character and scope of the doctrine of the\nresurrection of Jesus, at the time when it was first elaborated.\nWe have now to notice the influence of that doctrine upon the\ndevelopment of Christologic speculation.",
        "In neither or the four genuine epistles of Paul is Jesus\ndescribed as superhuman, or as differing in nature from other\nmen, save in his freedom from sin. As Baur has shown, “the proper\nnature of the Pauline Christ is human. He is a man, but a\nspiritual man, one in whom spirit or pneuma was the essential\nprinciple, so that he was spirit as well as man. The principle of\nan ideal humanity existed before Christ in the bright form of a\ntypical man, but was manifested to mankind in the person of\nChrist.” Such, according to Baur, is Paul’s interpretation of the\nMessianic idea. Paul knows nothing of the miracles, of the\nsupernatural conception, of the incarnation, or of the Logos. The\nChrist whom he preaches is the man Jesus, the founder of a new\nand spiritual order of humanity, as Adam was the father of\nhumanity after the flesh. The resurrection is uniformly described\nby him as a manifestation of the power of Jehovah, not of Jesus\nhimself. The later conception of Christ bursting the barred gates\nof Sheol, and arising by his own might to heaven, finds no\nwarrant in the expressions of Paul. Indeed, it was essential to\nPaul’s theory of the Messiah as a new Adam, that he should be\nhuman and not divine; for the escape of a divine being from Sheol\ncould afford no precedent and furnish no assurance of the future\nescape of human beings. It was expressly because the man Jesus\nhad been rescued from the grave because of his spirituality, that\nother men might hope, by becoming spiritual like him, to be\nrescued also. Accordingly Paul is careful to state that “since\nthrough man came death, through man came also the resurrection of\nthe dead” (1 Cor. xv. 21); a passage which would look like an\nexpress denial of Christ’s superhuman character, were it probable\nthat any of Paul’s contemporaries had ever conceived of Jesus as\nother than essentially human.",
        "But though Paul’s Christology remained in this primitive stage,\nit contained the germs of a more advanced theory. For even Paul\nconceived of Jesus as a man wholly exceptional in spiritual\ncharacter; or, in the phraseology of the time, as consisting to a\nlarger extent of pneuma than any man who had lived before him.\nThe question was sure to arise, Whence came this pneuma or\nspiritual quality? Whether the question ever distinctly presented\nitself to Paul’s mind cannot be determined. Probably it did not.\nIn those writings of his which have come down to us, he shows\nhimself careless of metaphysical considerations. He is mainly\nconcerned with exhibiting the unsatisfactory character of Jewish\nChristianity, and with inculcating a spiritual morality, to which\nthe doctrine of Christ’s resurrection is made to supply a\nsurpassingly powerful sanction. But attempts to solve the problem\nwere not long in coming. According to a very early tradition, of\nwhich the obscured traces remain in the synoptic gospels, Jesus\nreceived the pneuma at the time of his baptism, when the Holy\nSpirit, or visible manifestation of the essence of Jehovah,\ndescended upon him and became incarnate in him. This theory,\nhowever, was exposed to the objection that it implied a sudden\nand entire transformation of an ordinary man into a person\ninspired or possessed by the Deity. Though long maintained by the\nEbionites or primitive Christians, it was very soon rejected by\nthe great body of the Church, which asserted instead that Jesus\nhad been inspired by the Holy Spirit from the moment of his\nconception. From this it was but a step to the theory that Jesus\nwas actually begotten by or of the Holy Spirit; a notion which\nthe Hellenic mind, accustomed to the myths of Leda, Anchises, and\nothers, found no difficulty in entertaining. According to the\nGospel of the Hebrews, as cited by Origen, the Holy Spirit was\nthe mother of Jesus, and Joseph was his father. But according to\nthe prevailing opinion, as represented in the first and third\nsynoptists, the relationship was just the other way. With greater\napparent plausibility, the divine aeon was substituted for the\nhuman father, and a myth sprang up, of which the materialistic\ndetails furnished to the opponents of the new religion an\nopportunity for making the most gross and exasperating\ninsinuations. The dominance of this theory marks the era at which\nour first and third synoptic gospels were composed,—from sixty\nto ninety years after the death of Jesus. In the luxuriant\nmythologic growth there exhibited, we may yet trace the various\nsuccessive phases of Christologic speculation but imperfectly\nblended. In “Matthew” and “Luke” we find the original Messianic\ntheory exemplified in the genealogies of Jesus, in which,\ncontrary to historic probability (cf. Matt. xxii. 41-46), but in\naccordance with a time-honoured tradition, his pedigree is traced\nback to David; “Matthew” referring him to the royal line of\nJudah, while “Luke” more cautiously has recourse to an assumed\nyounger branch. Superposed upon this primitive mythologic\nstratum, we find, in the same narratives, the account of the\ndescent of the pneuma at the time of the baptism; and crowning\nthe whole, there are the two accounts of the nativity which,\nthough conflicting in nearly all their details, agree in\nrepresenting the divine pneuma as the father of Jesus. Of these\nthree stages of Christology, the last becomes entirely\nirreconcilable with the first; and nothing can better illustrate\nthe uncritical character of the synoptists than the fact that the\nassumed descent of Jesus from David through his father Joseph is\nallowed to stand side by side with the account of the miraculous\nconception which completely negatives it. Of this difficulty\n\"Matthew” is quite unconscious, and “Luke,” while vaguely\nnoticing it (iii. 23), proposes no solution, and appears\nundisturbed by the contradiction.",
        "Thus far the Christology with which we have been dealing is\npredominantly Jewish, though to some extent influenced by\nHellenic conceptions. None of the successive doctrines presented\nin Paul, “Matthew,” and “Luke” assert or imply the pre-existence\nof Jesus. At this early period he was regarded as a human being\nraised to participation in certain attributes of divinity; and\nthis was as far as the dogma could be carried by the Jewish\nmetaphysics. But soon after the date of our third gospel, a\nHellenic system of Christology arose into prominence, in which\nthe problem was reversed, and Jesus was regarded as a semi-divine\nbeing temporarily lowered to participation in certain attributes\nof humanity. For such a doctrine Jewish mythology supplied no\nprecedents; but the Indo-European mind was familiar with the\nconception of deity incarnate in human form, as in the avatars of\nVishnu, or even suffering III the interests of humanity, as in\nthe noble myth of Prometheus. The elements of Christology\npre-existing in the religious conceptions of Greece, India, and\nPersia, are too rich and numerous to be discussed here. A very\nfull account of them is given in Mr. R. W. Mackay’s acute and\nlearned treatise on the “Religious Development of the Greeks and\nHebrews{.}”",
        "It was in Alexandria, where Jewish theology first came into\ncontact with Hellenic and Oriental ideas, that the way was\nprepared for the dogma of Christ’s pre-existence. The attempt to\nrationalize the conception of deity as embodied in the Jehovah of\nthe Old Testament gave rise to the class of opinions described as\nGnosis, or Gnosticism. The signification of Gnosis is simply\n\"rationalism,\"—the endeavour to harmonize the materialistic\nstatements of an old mythology with the more advanced\nspiritualistic philosophy of the time. The Gnostics rejected the\nconception of an anthropomorphic deity who had appeared visibly\nand audibly to the patriarchs; and they were the authors of the\ndoctrine, very widely spread during the second and third\ncenturies, that God could not in person have been the creator of\nthe world. According to them, God, as pure spirit, could not act\ndirectly upon vile and gross matter. The difficulty which\ntroubled them was curiously analogous to that which disturbed the\nCartesians and the followers of Leibnitz in the seventeenth\ncentury; how was spirit to act upon matter, without ceasing, pro\ntanto, to be spirit? To evade this difficulty, the Gnostics\npostulated a series of emanations from God, becoming successively\nless and less spiritual and more and more material, until at the\nlowest end of the scale was reached the Demiurgus or Jehovah of\nthe Old Testament, who created the world and appeared, clothed in\nmaterial form, to the patriarchs. According to some of the\nGnostics this lowest aeon or emanation was identical with the\nJewish Satan, or the Ahriman of the Persians, who is called “the\nprince of this world,” and the creation of the world was an\nessentially evil act. But all did not share in these extreme\nopinions. In the prevailing, theory, this last of the divine\nemanations was identified with the “Sophia,” or personified\n\"Wisdom,” of the Book of Proverbs (viii. 22-30), who is described\nas present with God before the foundation of the world. The\ntotality of these aeons constituted the pleroma, or “fulness of\nGod” (Coloss. i. 20; Eph. i. 23), and in a corollary which bears\nunmistakable marks of Buddhist influence, it was argued that, in\nthe final consummation of things, matter should be eliminated and\nall spirit reunited with God, from whom it had primarily flowed.",
        "It was impossible that such views as these should not soon be\ntaken up and applied to the fluctuating Christology of the time.\nAccording to the “Shepherd of Hermas,” an apocalyptic writing\nnearly contemporary with the gospel of “Mark,” the aeon or son of\nGod who existed previous to the creation was not the Christ, or\nthe Sophia, but the Pneuma or Holy Spirit, represented in the Old\nTestament as the “angel of Jehovah.” Jesus, in reward for his\nperfect goodness, was admitted to a share in the privileges of\nthis Pneuma (Reville, p. 39). Here, as M. Reville observes,\nthough a Gnostic idea is adopted, Jesus is nevertheless viewed as\nascending humanity, and not as descending divinity. The author of\nthe “Clementine Homilies” advances a step farther, and clearly\nassumes the pre-existence of Jesus, who, in his opinion, was the\npure, primitive man, successively incarnate in Adam, Enoch, Noah,\nAbraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and finally in the Messiah or\nChrist. The author protests, in vehement language, against those\nHellenists who, misled by their polytheistic associations, would\nelevate Jesus into a god. Nevertheless, his own hypothesis of\npre-existence supplied at once the requisite fulcrum for those\nGnostics who wished to reconcile a strict monotheism with the\nascription of divine attributes to Jesus. Combining with this\nnotion of pre-existence the pneumatic or spiritual quality\nattributed to Jesus in the writings of Paul, the Gnosticizing\nChristians maintained that Christ was an aeon or emanation from\nGod, redeeming men from the consequences entailed by their\nimprisonment in matter. At this stage of Christologic speculation\nappeared the anonymous epistle to the “Hebrews,” and the\npseudo-Pauline epistles to the “Colossians,” “Ephesians,” and\n\"Philippians” (A. D. 130). In these epistles, which originated\namong the Pauline Christians, the Gnostic theosophy is skilfully\napplied to the Pauline conception of the scope and purposes of\nChristianity. Jesus is described as the creator of the world\n(Coloss. i. 16), the visible image of the invisible God, the\nchief and ruler of the “throues, dominions, principalities, and\npowers,” into which, in Gnostic phraseology, the emanations of\nGod were classified. Or, according to “Colossians” and\n\"Philippians,” all the aeons are summed up in him, in whom dwells\nthe pleroma, or “fulness of God.” Thus Jesus is elevated quite\nabove ordinary humanity, and a close approach is made to\nditheism, although he is still emphatically subordinated to God\nby being made the creator of the world,—an office then regarded\nas incompatible with absolute divine perfection. In the\ncelebrated passage, “Philippians” ii. 6-11, the aeon Jesus is\ndescribed as being the form or visible manifestation of God, yet\nas humbling himself by taking on the form or semblance of\nhumanity, and suffering death, in return for which he is to be\nexalted even above the archangels. A similar view is taken in\n\"Hebrews\"; and it is probable that to the growing favour with\nwhich these doctrines were received, we owe the omission of the\nmiraculous conception from the gospel of “Mark,\"—a circumstance\nwhich has misled some critics into assigning to that gospel an\nearlier date than to “Matthew” and “Luke.” Yet the fact that in\nthis gospel Jesus is implicitly ranked above the angels (Mark\nxiii. 32), reveals a later stage of Christologic doctrine than\nthat reached by the first and third synoptists; and it is\naltogether probable that, in accordance with the noticeable\nconciliatory disposition of this evangelist, the supernatural\nconception is omitted out of deference to the Gnosticizing\ntheories of “Colossians” and “Philippians,” in which this\nmaterialistic doctrine seems to have had no assignable place. In\n\"Philippians” especially, many expressions seem to verge upon\nDocetism, the extreme form of Gnosticism, according to which the\nhuman body of Jesus was only a phantom. Valentinus, who was\ncontemporary with the Pauline writers of the second century,\nmaintained that Jesus was not born of Mary by any process of\nconception, but merely passed through her, as light traverses a\ntranslucent substance. And finally Marcion (A. D. 140) carried\nthe theory to its extreme limits by declaring that Jesus was the\npure Pneuma or Spirit, who contained nothing in common with\ncarnal humanity.",
        "The pseudo-Pauline writers steered clear of this extravagant\ndoctrine, which erred by breaking entirely with historic\ntradition, and was consequently soon condemned as heretical.\nTheir language, though unmistakably Gnostic, was sufficiently\nneutral and indefinite to allow of their combination with earlier\nand later expositions of dogma, and they were therefore\neventually received into the canon, where they exhibit a stage of\nopinion midway between that of Paul and that of the fourth\ngospel.",
        "For the construction of a durable system of Christology, still\nfurther elaboration was necessary. The pre-existence of Jesus, as\nan emanation from God, in whom were summed up the attributes of\nthe pleroma or full scale of Gnostic aeons, was now generally\nconceded. But the relation of this pleroqma to the Godhead of\nwhich it was the visible manifestation, needed to be more\naccurately defined. And here recourse was had to the conception\nof the “Logos,\"—a notion which Philo had borrowed from Plato,\nlending to it a theosophic significance. In the Platonic\nmetaphysics objective existence was attributed to general terms,\nthe signs of general notions. Besides each particular man, horse,\nor tree, and besides all men, horses, and trees, in the\naggregate, there was supposed to exist an ideal Man, Horse, and\nTree. Each particular man, horse, or tree consisted of abstract\nexistence plus a portion of the ideal man, horse, or tree.\nSokrates, for instance, consisted of Existence, plus Animality,\nplus Humanity, plus Sokraticity. The visible world of particulars\nthus existed only by virtue of its participation in the\nattributes of the ideal world of universals. God created the\nworld by encumbering each idea with an envelopment or clothing of\nvisible matter; and since matter is vile or imperfect, all things\nare more or less perfect as they partake more or less fully of\nthe idea. The pure unencumbered idea, the “Idea of ideas,” is the\nLogos, or divine Reason, which represents the sum-total of the\nactivities which sustain the world, and serves as a mediator\nbetween the absolutely ideal God and the absolutely non-ideal\nmatter. Here we arrive at a Gnostic conception, which the\nPhilonists of Alexandria were not slow to appropriate. The Logos,\nor divine Reason, was identified with the Sophia, or divine\nWisdom of the Jewish Gnostics, which had dwelt with God before\nthe creation of the world. By a subtle play upon the double\nmeaning of the Greek term (logos = “reason” or “word”), a\ndistinction was drawn between the divine Reason and the divine\nWord. The former was the archctypal idea or thought of God,\nexisting from all eternity; the latter was the external\nmanifestation or realization of that idea which occurred at the\nmoment of creation, when, according to Genesis, God SPOKE, and\nthe world was.",
        "In the middle of the second century, this Philonian theory was\nthe one thing needful to add metaphysical precision to the\nGnostic and Pauline speculations concerning the nature of Jesus.\nIn the writings of Justin Martyr (A. D. 150-166), Jesus is for\nthe first time identified with the Philonian Logos or “Word of\nGod.” According to Justin, an impassable abyss exists between the\nInfinite Deity and the Finite World; the one cannot act upon the\nother; pure spirit cannot contaminate itself by contact with\nimpure matter. To meet this difficulty, God evolves from himself\na secondary God, the Logos,—yet without diminishing himself any\nmore than a flame is diminished when it gives birth to a second\nflame. Thus generated, like light begotten of light (lumen de\nlumine), the Logos creates the world, inspires the ancient\nprophets with their divine revelations, and finally reveals\nhimself to mankind in the person of Christ. Yet Justin sedulously\nguards himself against ditheism, insisting frequently and\nemphatically upon the immeasurable inferiority of the Logos as\ncompared with the actual God (gr o ontws qeos).",
        "We have here reached very nearly the ultimate phase of New\nTestament speculation concerning Jesus. The doctrines enunciated\nby Justin became eventually, with slight modification, the\nofficial doctrines of the Church; yet before they could thus be\nreceived, some further elaboration was needed. The pre-existing\nLogos-Christ of Justin was no longer the human Messiah of the\nfirst and third gospels, born of a woman, inspired by the divine\nPneuma, and tempted by the Devil. There was danger that\nChristologic speculation might break quite loose from historic\ntradition, and pass into the metaphysical extreme of Docetism.\nHad this come to pass, there might perhaps have been a fatal\nschism in the Church. Tradition still remained Ebionitish; dogma\nhad become decidedly Gnostic; how were the two to be moulded into\nharmony with each other? Such was the problem which presented\nitself to the author of the fourth gospel (A. D. 170-180). As M.\nReville observes, “if the doctrine of the Logos were really to be\napplied to the person of Jesus, it was necessary to remodel the\nevangelical history.” Tradition must be moulded so as to fit the\ndogma, but the dogma must be restrained by tradition from running\ninto Docetic extravagance. It must be shown historically how “the\nWord became flesh” and dwelt on earth (John i. 14), how the deeds\nof Jesus of Nazareth were the deeds of the incarnate Logos, in\nwhom was exhibited the pleroma or fulness of the divine\nattributes. The author of the fourth gospel is, like Justin, a\nPhilonian Gnostic; but he differs from Justin in his bold and\nskilful treatment of the traditional materials supplied by the\nearlier gospels. The process of development in the theories and\npurposes of Jesus, which can be traced throughout the Messianic\ndescriptions of the first gospel, is entirely obliterated in the\nfourth. Here Jesus appears at the outset as the creator of the\nworld, descended from his glory, but destined soon to be\nreinstated. The title “Son of Man” has lost its original\nsignificance, and become synonymous with “Son of God.” The\ntemptation, the transfiguration, the scene in Gethsemane, are\nomitted, and for the latter is substituted a Philonian prayer.\nNevertheless, the author carefully avoids the extremes of\nDocetism or ditheism. Not only does he represent the human life\nof Jesus as real, and his death as a truly physical death, but he\ndistinctly asserts the inferiority of the Son to the Father (John\nxiv. 28). Indeed, as M. Reville well observes, it is part of the\nvery notion of the Logos that it should be imperfect relatively\nto the absolute God; since it is only its relative imperfection\nwhich allows it to sustain relations to the world and to men\nwhich are incompatible with absolute perfection, from the\nPhilonian point of view. The Athanasian doctrine of the Trinity\nfinds no support in the fourth gospel, any more than in the\nearlier books collected in the New Testament.",
        "The fourth gospel completes the speculative revolution by which\nthe conception of a divine being lowered to humanity was\nsubstituted for that of a human being raised to divinity. We have\nhere travelled a long distance from the risen Messiah of the\ngenuine Pauline epistles, or the preacher of righteousness in the\nfirst gospel. Yet it does not seem probable that the Church of\nthe third century was thoroughly aware of the discrepancy. The\nauthors of the later Christology did not regard themselves as\nadding new truths to Christianity, but merely as giving a fuller\nand more consistent interpretation to what must have been known\nfrom the outset. They were so completely destitute of the\nhistoric sense, and so strictly confined to the dogmatic point of\nview, that they projected their own theories back into the past,\nand vituperated as heretics those who adhered to tradition in its\nearlier and simpler form. Examples from more recent times are not\nwanting, which show that we are dealing here with an inveterate\ntendency of the human mind. New facts and new theories are at\nfirst condemned as heretical or ridiculous; but when once firmly\nestablished, it is immediately maintained that every one knew\nthem before. After the Copernican astronomy had won the day, it\nwas tacitly assumed that the ancient Hebrew astronomy was\nCopernican, and the Biblical conception of the universe as a kind\nof three-story house was ignored, and has been, except by\nscholars, quite forgotten. When the geologic evidence of the\nearth’s immense antiquity could no longer be gainsaid, it was\nsuddenly ascertained that the Bible had from the outset asserted\nthat antiquity; and in our own day we have seen an elegant\npopular writer perverting the testimony of the rocks and\ndistorting the Elohistic cosmogony of the Pentateuch, until the\ntwain have been made to furnish what Bacon long ago described as\n\"a heretical religion and a false philosophy.” Now just as in the\npopular thought of the present day the ancient Elohist is\naccredited with a knowledge of modern geology and astronomy, so\nin the opinion of the fourth evangelist and his contemporaries\nthe doctrine of the Logos-Christ was implicitly contained in the\nOld Testament and in the early traditions concerning Jesus, and\nneeded only to be brought into prominence by a fresh\ninterpretation. Hence arose the fourth gospel, which was no more\na conscious violation of historic data than Hugh Miller’s\nimaginative description of the “Mosaic Vision of Creation.” Its\nmetaphysical discourses were readily accepted as equally\nauthentic with the Sermon on the Mount. Its Philonian doctrines\nwere imputed to Paul and the apostles, the pseudo-Pauline\nepistles furnishing the needful texts. The Ebionites—who were\nsimply Judaizing Christians, holding in nearly its original form\nthe doctrine of Peter, James, and John—were ejected from the\nChurch as the most pernicious of heretics; and so completely was\ntheir historic position misunderstood and forgotten, that, in\norder to account for their existence, it became necessary to\ninvent an eponymous heresiarch, Ebion, who was supposed to have\nled them astray from the true faith!",
        "The Christology of the fourth gospel is substantially the same as\nthat which was held in the next two centuries by Tertullian,\nClement of Alexandria, Origen, and Arius. When the doctrine of\nthe Trinity was first announced by Sabellius (A. D. 250-260), it\nwas formally condemned as heretical, the Church being not yet\nquite prepared to receive it. In 269 the Council of Antioch\nsolemnly declared that the Son was NOT consubstantial with the\nFather,—a declaration which, within sixty years, the Council of\nNikaia was destined as solemnly to contradict. The Trinitarian\nChristology struggled long for acceptance, and did not finally\nwin the victory until the end of the fourth century. Yet from the\noutset its ultimate victory was hardly doubtful. The peculiar\ndoctrines of the fourth gospel could retain their integrity only\nso long as Gnostic ideas were prevalent. When Gnosticism declined\nin importance, and its theories faded out of recollection, its\npeculiar phraseology received of necessity a new interpretation.\nThe doctrine that God could not act directly upon the world sank\ngradually into oblivion as the Church grew more and more hostile\nto the Neo-Platonic philosophy. And when this theory was once\nforgotten, it was inevitable that the Logos, as the creator of\nthe world, should be raised to an equality or identity with God\nhimself. In the view of the fourth evangelist, the Creator was\nnecessarily inferior to God; in the view of later ages, the\nCreator could be none other than God. And so the very phrases\nwhich had most emphatically asserted the subordination of the Son\nwere afterward interpreted as asserting his absolute divinity. To\nthe Gnostic formula, lumen de lumine, was added the Athanasian\nscholium, Deum verum de Deo vero; and the Trinitarian dogma of\nthe union of persons in a single Godhead became thus the only\navailable logical device for preserving the purity of monotheism.",

        "[24] These comments on Mr. Henry Rogers’s review of M. Renan’s\nLes Apotres, contained in a letter to Mr. Lewes, were shortly\nafterwards published by him in the Fortnightly Review, September\n15, 1866,",
        "It is the lot of every book which attempts to treat the origin\nand progress of Christianity in a sober and scientific spirit, to\nmeet with unsparing attacks. Critics in plenty are always to be\nfound, who, possessed with the idea that the entire significance\nand value of the Christian religion are demolished unless we\nregard it as a sort of historical monstrosity, are only too eager\nto subject the offending work to a scathing scrutiny, displaying\nwithal a modicum of righteous indignation at the unblushing\nheresy of the author, not unmixed with a little scornful pity at\nhis inability to believe very preposterous stories upon very\nmeagre evidence. “Conservative” polemics of this sort have\ndoubtless their function. They serve to purge scientific\nliterature of the awkward and careless statements too often made\nby writers not sufficiently instructed or cautious, which in the\nabsence of hostile criticism might get accepted by the unthinking\nreader along with the truths which they accompany. Most\nscientific and philosophical works have their defects; and it is\nfortunate that there is such a thing as dogmatic ardour in the\nworld, ever sharpening its wits to the utmost, that it may spy\neach lurking inaccuracy and ruthlessly drag it to light. But this\nuseful spirit is wont to lead those who are inspired by it to\nshoot beyond the mark, and after pointing out the errors of\nothers, to commit fresh mistakes of their own. In the skilful\ncriticism of M. Renan’s work on the Apostles, in No. 29 of the\n\"Fortnightly Review” there is now and then a vulnerable spot\nthrough which a controversial shaft may perhaps be made to\npierce.",
        "It may be true that Lord Lyttelton’s tract on the Conversion of\nSt. Paul, as Dr. Johnson and Dr. Rogers have said, has never yet\nbeen refuted; but if I may judge from my own recollection of the\nwork, I should say that this must be because no competent writer\never thought it worth his pains to criticize it. Its argument\ncontains about as much solid consistency as a distended balloon,\nand collapses as readily at the first puncture. It attempts to\nprove, first, that the conversion of St. Paul cannot be made\nintelligible except on the assumption that there was a miracle in\nthe case; and secondly, that if Paul was converted by a miracle,\nthe truth of Christianity is impregnable. Now, if the first of\nthese points be established, the demonstration is not yet\ncomplete, for the second point must be proved independently. But\nif the first point be overthrown, the second loses its prop, and\nfalls likewise.",
        "Great efforts are therefore made to show that no natural\ninfluences could have intervened to bring about a change in the\nfeelings of Paul. He was violent, “thorough,” unaffected by pity\nor remorse; and accordingly he could not have been so completely\naltered as he was, had he not actually beheld the risen Christ:\nsuch is the argument which Mr. Rogers deems so conclusive. I do\nnot know that from any of Paul’s own assertions we are entitled\nto affirm that no shade of remorse had ever crossed his mind\nprevious to the vision near Damascus. But waiving this point, I\ndo maintain that, granting Paul’s feelings to have been as Mr.\nRogers thinks they were, his conversion is inexplicable, even on\nthe hypothesis of a miracle. He that is determined not to\nbelieve, will not believe, though one should rise from the dead.\nTo make Paul a believer, it was not enough that he should meet\nhis Lord face to face he must have been already prepared to\nbelieve. Otherwise he would have easily found means of explaining\nthe miracle from his own point of view. He would certainly have\nattributed it to the wiles of the demon, even as the Pharisees\nare said to have done with regard to the miraculous cures\nperformed by Jesus. A “miraculous” occurrence in those days did\nnot astonish as it would at present. “Miracles” were rather the\norder of the day, and in fact were lavished with such extreme\nbounty on all hands, that their convincing power was very slight.\nNeither side ever thought of disputing the reality of the\nmiracles supposed to be performed on the other; but each side\nconsidered the miracles of its antagonist to be the work of\ndiabolic agencies. Such being the case, it is useless to suppose\nthat Paul could have distinguished between a true and a false\nmiracle, or that a real miracle could of itself have had any\neffect in inducing him to depart from his habitual course of\nbelief and action. As far as Paul’s mental operations were\nconcerned, it could have made no difference whether he met with\nhis future Master in person, or merely encountered him in a\nvision. The sole point to be considered is whether or not he\nBELIEVED in the Divine character and authority of the event which\nhad happened. What the event might have really been was of no\npractical consequence to him or to any one else. What he believed\nit to be was of the first importance. And since he did believe\nthat he had been divinely summoned to cease persecuting, and\ncommence preaching the new faith, it follows that his state of\nmind must have been more or less affected by circumstances other\nthan the mere vision. Had he not been ripe for change, neither\nshadow nor substance could have changed him.",
        "This view of the case is by no means so extravagant as Mr. Rogers\nwould have us suppose. There is no reason for believing that\nPaul’s character was essentially different afterwards from what\nit had been before. The very fervour which caused him, as a\nPharisee, to exclude all but orthodox Jews from the hope of\nsalvation, would lead him, as a Christian, to carry the Christian\nidea to its extreme development, and admit all persons whatever\nto the privileges of the Church. The same zeal for the truth\nwhich had urged him to persecute the Christians unto the death\nafterwards led him to spare no toil and shun no danger which\nmight bring about the triumph of their cause. It must not be\nforgotten that the persecutor and the martyr are but one and the\nsame man under different circumstances. He who is ready to die\nfor his own faith will sometimes think it fair to make other men\ndie for theirs. Men of a vehement and fiery temperament,\nmoreover,—such as Paul always was,—never change their opinions\nslowly, never rest in philosophic doubt, never take a middle\ncourse. If they leave one extreme for an instant, they are drawn\nirresistibly to the other; and usually very little is needed to\nwork the change. The conversion of Omar is a striking instance in\npoint, and has been cited by M. Renan himself. The character of\nOmar bears a strong likeness to that of Paul. Previous to his\nconversion, he was a conscientious and virulent persecutor of\nMohammedanism.[25] After his conversion, he was Mohammed’s most\nefficient disciple, and it may be safely asserted that for\ndisinterestedness and self-abnegation he was not inferior to the\nApostle of the Gentiles. The change in his case was, moreover,\nquite as sudden and unexpected as it was with Paul; it was\nneither more nor less incomprehensible; and if Paul’s conversion\nneeds a miracle to explain it, Omar’s must need one likewise. But\nin truth, there is no difficulty in the case, save that which\nstupid dogmatism has created. The conversions of Paul and Omar\nare paralleled by innumerable events which occur in every period\nof religious or political excitement. Far from being\nextraordinary, or inexplicable on natural grounds, such phenomena\nare just what might occasionally be looked for.",

        "But, says Mr. Rogers, “is it possible for a moment to imagine the\ndoting and dreaming victim of hallucinations (which M. Renan’s\ntheory represents Paul) to be the man whose masculine sense,\nstrong logic, practical prudence, and high administrative talent\nappear in the achievements of his life, and in the Epistles he\nhas left behind him?” M. Renan’s theory does not, however,\nrepresent Paul as the “victim of hallucinations “to a greater\ndegree than Mohammed. The latter, as every one knows, laboured\nduring much of his life under almost constant “hallucination\";\nyet “masculine sense, strong logic,” etc., were qualities quite\nas conspicuous in him as in St. Paul.",
        "Here, as throughout his essay, Mr. Rogers shows himself totally\nunable to comprehend the mental condition of men in past ages. If\nan Apostle has a dream or sees a vision, and interprets it\naccording to the ideas of his time and country, instead of\naccording to the ideas of scientific England in the nineteenth\ncentury Mr. Rogers thinks he must needs be mad: and when\naccording to the well-known law that mental excitement is\ncontagious,[26] several persons are said to have concurred in\ninterpreting some phenomenon supernaturally, Mr. Rogers cannot\nsee why so many people should all go mad at once! “To go mad,” in\nfact is his favourite designation for a mental act, which nearly\nall the human race have habitually performed in all ages; the act\nof mistaking subjective impressions for outward realities. The\ndisposition to regard all strange phenomena as manifestations of\nsupernatural power was universally prevalent in the first century\nof Christianity, and long after. Neither greatness of intellect\nnor thoroughness of scepticism gave exemption. Even Julius\nCaesar, the greatest practical genius that ever lived, was\nsomewhat superstitious, despite his atheism and his Vigorous\ncommon-sense. It is too often argued that the prevalence of\nscepticism in the Roman Empire must have made men scrupulous\nabout accepting miracles. By no means. Nothing but physical\nscience ever drives out miracles: mere doctrinal scepticism is\npowerless to do it. In the age of the Apostles, little if any\nradical distinction was drawn between a miracle and an ordinary\noccurrence. No one supposed a miracle to be an infraction of the\nlaws of nature, for no one had a clear idea that there were such\nthings as laws of nature. A miracle was simply an extraordinary\nact, exhibiting the power of the person who performed it. Blank,\nindeed, would the evangelists have looked, had any one told them\nwhat an enormous theory of systematic meddling with nature was\ndestined to grow out of their beautiful and artless narratives.",
        "[26] Hecker’s Epidemics of the Middle Ages, pp. 87-152.",
        "The incapacity to appreciate this frame of mind renders the\ncurrent arguments in behalf of miracles utterly worthless. From\nthe fact that Celsus and others never denied the reality of the\nChristian miracles, it is commonly inferred that those miracles\nmust have actually happened. The same argument would, however,\nequally apply to the miracles of Apollonius and Simon Magus, for\nthe Christians never denied the reality of these. What these\nfacts really prove is that the state of human intelligence was as\nI have just described it: and the inference to be drawn from them\nis that no miraculous account emanating from an author of such a\nperiod is worthy of serious attention. When Mr. Rogers supposes\nthat if the miracles had not really happened they would have been\nchallenged, he is assuming that a state of mind existed in which\nit was possible for miracles to be challenged; and thus commits\nan anachronism as monstrous as if he had attributed the knowledge\nof some modern invention, such as steamboats, to those early\nages.",
        "Mr. Rogers seems to complain of M. Renan for “quietly assuming\"\nthat miracles are invariably to be rejected. Certainly a\nhistorian of the present day who should not make such an\nassumption would betray his lack of the proper qualifications for\nhis profession. It is not considered necessary for every writer\nto begin his work by setting out to prove the first principles of\nhistorical criticism. They are taken for granted. And, as M.\nRenan justly says, a miracle is one of those things which must be\ndisbelieved until it is proved. The onus probandi lies on the\nassertor of a fact which conflicts with universal experience.\nNevertheless, the great number of intelligent persons who, even\nnow, from dogmatic reasons, accept the New Testament miracles,\nforbids that they should be passed over in silence like similar\nphenomena elsewhere narrated. But, in the present state of\nhistorical science, the arguing against miracles is, as Colet\nremarked of his friend Erasmus’s warfare against the Thomists and\nScotists of Cambridge, “a contest more necessary than glorious or\ndifficult.” To be satisfactorily established, a miracle needs at\nleast to be recorded by an eyewitness; and the mental attainments\nof the witness need to be thoroughly known besides. Unless he has\na clear conception of the difference between the natural and the\nunnatural order of events, his testimony, however unimpeachable\non the score of honesty, is still worthless. To say that this\ncondition was fulfilled by those who described the New Testament\nmiracles, would be absurd. And in the face of what German\ncriticism has done for the early Christian documents, it would be\nan excess of temerity to assert that any one of the supernatural\naccounts contained in them rests on contemporary authority. Of\nall history, the miraculous part should be attested by the\nstrongest testimony, whereas it is invariably attested by the\nweakest. And the paucity of miracles wherever we have\ncontemporary records, as in the case of primitive Islamism, is a\nmost significant fact.",
        "In attempting to defend his principle of never accepting a\nmiracle, M. Renan has indeed got into a sorry plight, and Mr.\nRogers, in controverting him, has not greatly helped the matter.\nBy stirring M. Renan’s bemuddled pool, Mr. Rogers has only\nbemuddled it the more. Neither of these excellent writers seems\nto suspect that transmutation of species, the geologic\ndevelopment of the earth, and other like phenomena do not present\nfeatures conflicting with ordinary experience. Sir Charles Lyell\nand Mr. Darwin would be greatly astonished to be told that their\ntheories of inorganic and organic evolution involved any agencies\nnot known to exist in the present course of nature. The great\nachievement of these writers has been to show that all past\nchanges of the earth and its inhabitants are to be explained as\nresulting from the continuous action of causes like those now in\noperation, and that throughout there has been nothing even\nfaintly resembling a miracle. M. Renan may feel perfectly safe in\nextending his principle back to the beginning of things; and Mr.\nRogers’s argument, even if valid against M. Renan, does not help\nhis own case in the least.",
        "On some points, indeed, M. Renan has laid himself open to severe\ncriticism, and on other points he has furnished good handles for\nhis orthodox opponents. His views in regard to the authorship of\nthe Fourth Gospel and the Acts are not likely to be endorsed by\nmany scholars; and his revival of the rationalistic absurdities\nof Paulus merits in most instances all that Mr. Rogers has said\nabout it. As was said at the outset, orthodox criticisms upon\nheterodox books are always welcome. They do excellent service.\nAnd with the feeling which impels their authors to defend their\nfavourite dogmas with every available weapon of controversy I for\none can heartily sympathize. Their zeal in upholding what they\nconsider the truth is greatly to be respected and admired. But so\nmuch cannot always be said for the mode of argumentation they\nadopt, which too often justifies M. Renan’s description, when he\nsays, “Raisonnements triomphants sur des choses que l’adversaire\nn’a pas dites, cris de victoire sur des erreurs qu’il n’a pas\ncommises, rien ne parait deloyal a celui qui croft tenir en main\nles interets de la verite absolue.”",

        "[27] History of the Conflict between Religion and Science. by\nJohn William Draper, M. D., LL. D. Fourth edition. New York: D.\nAppleton & Co. 1875. 12mo, pp. xxii., 373. (International\nScientific Series, XII.)",
        "Some twelve years ago, Dr. Draper published a bulky volume\nentitled “A History of the Intellectual Development of Europe,\"\nin which his professed purpose was to show that nations or races\npass through certain definable epochs of development, analogous\nto the periods of infancy, childhood, youth, manhood, and old age\nin individuals. But while announced with due formality, the\ncarrying out of the argument was left for the most part to the\nheadings and running-titles of the several chapters, while in the\ntext the author peacefully meandered along down the stream of\ntime, giving us a succession of pleasant though somewhat\nthreadbare anecdotes, as well as a superabundance of detached and\nfragmentary opinions on divers historical events, having\napparently quite forgotten that he had started with a thesis to\nprove. In the arrangement of his “running heads,” some points\nwere sufficiently curious to require a word of explanation, as,\nfor example, when the early ages of Christianity were at one time\nlabelled as an epoch of progress and at another time as an epoch\nof decrepitude. But the argument and the contents never got so\nfar en rapport with each other as to clear up such points as\nthis. On the contrary, each kept on the even tenour of its way\nwithout much regard to the other. From the titles of the chapters\none was led to expect some comprehensive theory of European\ncivilization continuously expounded. But the text merely showed a\ngreat quantity of superficial and second-hand information,\nserving to illustrate the mental idiosyncrasies of the author.\nAmong these idiosyncrasies might be noted a very inadequate\nunderstanding of the part played by Rome in the work of\ncivilization, a singular lack of appreciation of the political\nand philosophical achievements of Greece under Athenian\nleadership, a strong hostility to the Catholic Church, a curious\ndisposition to overrate semi-barbarous. or abortive\ncivilizations, such as those of the old Asiatic and native\nAmerican communities, at the expense of Europe, and, above all,\nan undiscriminating admiration for everything, great or small,\nthat has ever worn the garb of Islam or been associated with the\ncareer of the Saracens. The discovery that in some respects the\nMussulmans of the Middle Ages were more highly cultivated than\ntheir Christian contemporaries, has made such an impression on\nDr. Draper’s mind that it seems to be as hard for him to get rid\nof it as it was for Mr. Dick to keep the execution of Charles I.\nout of his “Memorial.” Even in an essay on the “Civil Policy of\nAmerica,” the turbaned sage figures quite prominently; and it is\nneedless to add that he reappears, as large as life, when the\nsubject of discussion is the attitude of science toward religion.",
        "Speaking briefly with regard to this matter, we may freely admit\nthat the work done by the Arabs, in scientific inquiry as well as\nin the making of events, was very considerable. It was a work,\ntoo, the value of which is not commonly appreciated in the\naccounts of European history written for the general reader, and\nwe have no disposition to find fault with Dr. Draper for\ndescribing it with enthusiasm. The philosophers of Bagdad and\nCordova did excellent service in keeping alive the traditions of\nGreek physical inquiry at a time when Christian thinkers were too\nexclusively occupied with transcendental speculations in theology\nand logic. In some departments, as in chemistry and astronomy,\nthey made original discoveries of considerable value; and if we\nturn from abstract knowledge to the arts of life, it cannot be\ndenied that the mediaeval Mussulmans had reached a higher plane\nof material comfort than their Christian contemporaries. In\nshort, the work of all kinds done by these people would furnish\nthe judicious advocate of the claims of the Semitic race with\nmaterials for a pleasing and instructive picture. Dr. Draper,\nhowever, errs, though no doubt unintentionally, by so presenting\nthe case as to leave upon the reader’s mind the impression that\nall this scientific and practical achievement was the work of\nIslamism, and that the Mohammedan civilization was of a higher\ntype than the Christian. It is with an apparent feeling of regret\nthat he looks upon the ousting of the Moors from dominion in\nSpain; but this is a mistaken view. As regards the first point,\nit is a patent fact that scientific inquiry was conducted at the\ncost of as much theological obloquy in the Mohammedan as in the\nChristian world. It is true there was more actual tolerance of\nheresy on the part of Moslem governments than was customary in\nEurope in those days; but this is a superficial fact, which does\nnot indicate any superiority in Moslem popular sentiment. The\ncaliphate or emirate was a truly absolute despotism, such as the\nPapacy has never been, and the conduct of a sceptical emir in\nencouraging scientific inquiry goes but little way toward proving\nanything like a general prevalence of tolerance or of\nfree-thinking. And this brings us to the second point,—that\nMohammedan civilization was, on the whole, rather a skin-deep\naffair. It was superficial because of that extreme severance\nbetween government and people which has never existed in European\nnations within historic times, but which has always existed among\nthe principal races that have professed Moslemism. Nowhere in the\nMohammedan world has there ever been what we call a national\nlife, and nowhere do we find in its records any trace of such an\nintellectual impulse, thrilling through every fibre of the people\nand begetting prodigious achievements in art, poetry, and\nphilosophy, as was awakened in Europe in the thirteenth century\nand again in the fifteenth. Under the peculiar form of unlimited\nmaterial and spiritual despotism exemplified in the caliphate, a\nfew men may discover gases or comment on Aristotle, but no\ngeneral movement toward political progress or philosophical\ninquiry is possible. Such a society is rigid and inorganic at\nbottom, whatever scanty signs of flexibility and life it may show\nat the surface. There is no better illustration of this, when\nwell considered, than the fact that Moorish civilization\nremained, politically and intellectually, a mere excrescence in\nSpain, after having been fastened down over half the country for\nnearly eight centuries.",
        "But we are in danger of forgetting our main theme, as Dr. Draper\nseems to do, while we linger with him over these interesting\nwayside topics. We may perhaps be excused, however, if we have\nnot yet made any very explicit allusion to the “Conflict between\nReligion and Science,” because this work seems to be in the main\na repetition en petit of the “Intellectual Development of\nEurope,” and what we have said will apply as well to one as to\nthe other. In the little book, as in the big one, we hear a great\ndeal about the Arabs, and something about Columbus and Galileo,\nwho made men accept sundry truths in the teeth of clerical\nopposition; and, as before, we float gently down the current of\nhistory without being over well-informed as to the precise\ndidactic purpose of our voyage. Here, indeed, even our headings\nand running-titles do not materially help us, for though we are\nsupposed to be witnessing, or mayhap assisting in, a perennial\nconflict between “science” and “religion,” we are nowhere\nenlightened as to what the cause or character of this conflict\nis, nor are we enabled to get a good look at either of the\nparties to the strife. With regard to it “religion” especially\nare we left in the dark. What this dreadful thing is towards\nwhich “science” is always playing the part of Herakles towards\nthe Lernaean Hydra, we are left to gather from the course of the\nnarrative. Yet, in a book with any valid claim to\nclearsightedness, one would think such a point as this ought to\nreceive very explicit preliminary treatment.",
        "The course of the narrative, however, leaves us in little doubt\nas to what Dr. Draper means by a conflict between science and\nreligion. When he enlarges on the trite story of Galileo, and\nalludes to the more modern quarrel between the Church and the\ngeologists, and does this in the belief that he is thereby\nillustrating an antagonism between religion and science, it is\nobvious that he identifies the cause of the anti-geologists and\nthe persecutors of Galileo with the cause of religion. The word\n\"religion” is to him a symbol which stands for unenlightened\nbigotry or narrow-minded unwillingness to look facts in the face.\nSuch a conception of religion is common enough, and unhappily a\ngreat deal has been done to strengthen it by the very persons to\nwhom the interests of religion are presumed to be a professional\ncare. It is nevertheless a very superficial conception, and no\nbook which is vitiated by it can have much philosophic value. It\nis simply the crude impression which, in minds unaccustomed to\nanalysis, is left by the fact that theologians and other persons\ninterested in religion are usually alarmed at new scientific\ntruths, and resist them with emotions so highly wrought that they\nare not only incapable of estimating evidence, but often also\nhave their moral sense impaired, and fight with foul means when\nfair ones fail. If we reflect carefully on this class of\nphenomena, we shall see that something besides mere pride of\nopinion is involved in the struggle. At the bottom of changing\ntheological beliefs there lies something which men perennially\nvalue, and for the sake of which they cling to the beliefs as\nlong as possible. That which they value is not itself a matter of\nbelief, but it is a matter of conduct; it is the searching after\ngoodness,—after a higher life than the mere satisfaction of\nindividual desires. All animals seek for fulness of life; but in\ncivilized man this craving has acquired a moral significance, and\nhas become a spiritual aspiration; and this emotional tendency,\nmore or less strong in the human race, we call religious feeling\nor religion. Viewed in this light, religion is not only something\nthat mankind is never likely to get rid of, but it is\nincomparably the most noble as well as the most useful attribute\nof humanity.",
        "Now, this emotional prompting toward completeness of life\nrequires, of course, that conduct should be guided, as far as\npossible, in accordance with a true theory of the relations of\nman to the world in which he lives. Hence, at any given era the\nreligious feeling will always be found enlisted in behalf of some\ntheory of the universe. At any time, whatever may be their\nshortcomings in practice, religious men will aim at doing right\naccording to their conceptions of the order of the world. If\nmen’s conceptions of the order of nature remained constant, no\napparent conflict between their religious feelings and their\nknowledge need ever arise. But with the first advance in our\nknowledge of nature the case is altered. New and strange theories\nare naturally regarded with fear and dislike by persons who have\nalways been accustomed to find the sanction and justification of\ntheir emotional prompting toward righteousness in old familiar\ntheories which the new ones are seeking to supplant. Such persons\noppose the new doctrine because their engrained mental habits\ncompel them to believe that its establishment will in some way\nlower men’s standard of life, and make them less careful of their\nspiritual welfare. This is the case, at all events, when\ntheologians oppose scientific conclusions on religious grounds,\nand not simply from mental dulness or rigidity. And, in so far as\nit is religious feeling which thus prompts resistance to\nscientific innovation, it may be said, with some appearance of\ntruth, that there is a conflict between religion and science.",
        "But there must always be two parties to a quarrel, and our\nstatement has to be modified as soon as we consider what the\nscientific innovator impugns. It is not the emotional prompting\ntoward righteousness, it is not the yearning to live im Guten,\nGanzen, Wahren, that he seeks to weaken; quite likely he has all\nthis as much at heart as the theologian who vituperates him. Nor\nis it true that his discoveries, in spite of him, tend to destroy\nthis all-important mental attitude. It would be ridiculous to say\nthat the fate of religious feeling is really involved in the fate\nof grotesque cosmogonies and theosophies framed in the infancy of\nmen’s knowledge of nature; for history shows us quite the\ncontrary. Religious feeling has survived the heliocentric theory\nand the discoveries of geologists; and it will be none the worse\nfor the establishment of Darwinism. It is the merest truism to\nsay that religion strikes its roots deeper down into human nature\nthan speculative opinion, and is accordingly independent of any\nparticular set of beliefs. Since, then, the scientific innovator\ndoes not, either voluntarily or involuntarily, attack religion,\nit follows that there can be no such “conflict” as that of which\nDr. Draper has undertaken to write the history. The real contest\nis between one phase of science and another; between the\nmore-crude knowledge of yesterday and the less-crude knowledge of\nto-day. The contest, indeed, as presented in history, is simply\nthe measure of the difficulty which men find in exchanging old\nviews for new ones. All along, the practical question has been,\nwhether we should passively acquiesce in the crude\ngeneralizations of our ancestors or venture actively to revise\nthem. But as for the religious sentiment, the perennial struggle\nin which it has been engaged has not been with scientific\ninquiry, but with the selfish propensities whose tendency is to\nmake men lead the lives of brutes.",
        "The time is at hand when the interests of religion can no longer\nbe supposed to be subserved by obstinate adherence to crude\nspeculations bequeathed to us from pre-scientific antiquity. One\ngood result of the doctrine of evolution, which is now gaining\nsway in all departments of thought, is the lesson that all our\nopinions must be held subject to continual revision, and that\nwith none of them can our religious interests be regarded as\nirretrievably implicated. To any one who has once learned this\nlesson, a book like Dr. Draper’s can be neither interesting nor\nuseful. He who has not learned it can derive little benefit from\na work which in its very title keeps open an old and baneful\nsource of error and confusion.",

        "The fame of Lessing is steadily growing. Year by year he is\nvalued more highly, and valued by a greater number of people. And\nhe is destined, like his master and forerunner Spinoza, to\nreceive a yet larger share of men’s reverence and gratitude when\nthe philosophic spirit which he lived to illustrate shall have\nbecome in some measure the general possession of the civilized\npart of mankind. In his own day, Lessing, though widely known and\ngreatly admired, was little understood or appreciated. He was\nknown to be a learned antiquarian, a terrible controversialist,\nand an incomparable writer. He was regarded as a brilliant\nornament to Germany; and a paltry Duke of Brunswick thought a few\nhundred thalers well spent in securing the glory of having such a\nman to reside at his provincial court. But the majority of\nLessing’s contemporaries understood him as little perhaps as did\nthe Duke of Brunswick. If anything were needed to prove this, it\nwould he the uproar which was made over the publication of the\n\"Wolfenbuttel Fragments,” and the curious exegesis which was\napplied to the poem of “Nathan” on its first appearance. In order\nto understand the true character of this great poem, and of\nLessing’s religious opinions as embodied in it, it will be\nnecessary first to consider the memorable theological controversy\nwhich preceded it.",
        "During Lessing’s residence at Hamburg, he had come into\npossession of a most important manuscript, written by Hermann\nSamuel Reimarus, a professor of Oriental languages, and bearing\nthe title of an “Apology for the Rational Worshippers of God.\"\nStruck with the rigorous logic displayed in its arguments, and\nwith the quiet dignity of its style, while yet unable to accept\nits most general conclusions, Lessing resolved to publish the\nmanuscript, accompanying it with his own comments and strictures.\nAccordingly in 1774, availing himself of the freedom from\ncensorship enjoyed by publications drawn from manuscripts\ndeposited in the Ducal Library at Wolfenbuttel, of which he was\nlibrarian, Lessing published the first portion of this work,\nunder the title of “Fragments drawn from the Papers of an\nAnonymous Writer.” This first Fragment, on the “Toleration of\nDeists,” awakened but little opposition; for the eighteenth\ncentury, though intolerant enough, did not parade its bigotry,\nbut rather saw fit to disclaim it. A hundred years before,\nRutherford, in his “Free Disputation,” had declared “toleration\nof alle religions to bee not farre removed from blasphemie.\"\nIntolerance was then a thing to be proud of, but in Lessing’s\ntime some progress had been achieved, and men began to think it a\ngood thing to seem tolerant. The succeeding Fragments were to\ntest this liberality and reveal the flimsiness of the stuff of\nwhich it was made. When the unknown disputant began to declare\n\"the impossibility of a revelation upon which all men can rest a\nsolid faith,” and when he began to criticize the evidences of\nChrist’s resurrection, such a storm burst out in the theological\nworld of Germany as had not been witnessed since the time of\nLuther. The recent Colenso controversy in England was but a\ngentle breeze compared to it. Press and pulpit swarmed with\n\"refutations,” in which weakness of argument and scantiness of\nerudition were compensated by strength of acrimony and\nunscrupulousness of slander. Pamphlets and sermons, says M.\nFontanes, “were multiplied, to denounce the impious blasphemer,\nwho, destitute alike of shame and of courage, had sheltered\nhimself behind a paltry fiction, in order to let loose upon\nsociety an evil spirit of unbelief.” But Lessing’s artifice had\nbeen intended to screen the memory of Reimarus, rather than his\nown reputation. He was not the man to quail before any amount of\nhuman opposition; and it was when the tempest of invective was\njust at its height that he published the last and boldest\nFragment of all,—on “the Designs of Jesus and his Disciples.”",
        "The publication of these Fragments led to a mighty controversy.\nThe most eminent, both for uncompromising zeal and for worldly\nposition, of those who had attacked Lessing, was Melchior Goetze,\n\"pastor primarius” at the Hamburg Cathedral. Though his name is\nnow remembered only because of his connection with Lessing,\nGoetze was not destitute of learning and ability. He was a\ncollector of rare books, an amateur in numismatics, and an\nantiquarian of the narrow-minded sort. Lessing had known him\nwhile at Hamburg, and had visited him so constantly as to draw\nforth from his friends malicious insinuations as to the\nexcellence of the pastor’s white wine. Doubtless Lessing, as a\nwise man, was not insensible to the attractions of good Moselle;\nbut that which he chiefly liked in this theologian was his\nlogical and rigorously consistent turn of mind. “He always,” says\nM. Fontanes, “cherished a holy horror of loose, inconsequent\nthinkers; and the man of the past, the inexorable guardian of\ntradition, appeared to him far more worthy of respect than the\nheterodox innovator who stops in mid-course, and is faithful\nneither to reason nor to faith.”",
        "But when Lessing published these unhallowed Fragments, the hour\nof conflict had sounded, and Goetze cast himself into the arena\nwith a boldness and impetuosity which Lessing, in his artistic\ncapacity, could not fail to admire. He spared no possible means\nof reducing his enemy to submission. He aroused against him all\nthe constituted authorities, the consistories, and even the Aulic\nCouncil of the Empire, and he even succeeded in drawing along\nwith him the chief of contemporary rationalists, Semler, who so\nfar forgot himself as to declare that Lessing, for what he had\ndone, deserved to be sent to the madhouse. But with all Goetze’s\northodox valour, he was no match for the antagonist whom he had\nexcited to activity. The great critic replied with pamphlet after\npamphlet, invincible in logic and erudition, sparkling with wit,\nand irritating in their utter coolness. Such pamphlets had not\nbeen seen since Pascal published the “Provincial Letters.” Goetze\nfound that he had taken up arms against a master in the arts of\ncontroversy, and before long he became well aware that he was\nworsted. Having brought the case before the Aulic Council, which\nconsisted in great part of Catholics, the stout pastor,\nforgetting that judgment had not yet been rendered, allowed\nhimself to proclaim that all who do not recognize the Bible as\nthe only source of Christianity are not fit to be called\nChristians at all. Lessing was not slow to profit by this unlucky\ndeclaration. Questioned, with all manner of ferocious\nvituperation, by Goetze, as to what sort of Christianity might\nhave existed prior to and independently of the New Testament\ncanon, Lessing imperturbably answered: “By the Christian religion\nI mean all the confessions of faith contained in the collection\nof creeds of the first four centuries of the Christian Church,\nincluding, if you wish it, the so-called creed of the apostles,\nas well as the creed of Athanasius. The content of these\nconfessions is called by the earlier Fathers the regula fidei, or\nrule of faith. This rule of faith is not drawn from the writings\nof the New Testament. It existed before any of the books in the\nNew Testament were written. It sufficed not only for the first\nChristians of the age of the apostles, but for their descendants\nduring four centuries. And it is, therefore, the veritable\nfoundation upon which the Church of Christ is built; a foundation\nnot based upon Scripture.” Thus, by a master-stroke, Lessing\nsecured the adherence of the Catholics constituting a majority of\nthe Aulic Council of the Empire. Like Paul before him, he divided\nthe Sanhedrim. So that Goetze, foiled in his attempts at using\nviolence, and disconcerted by the patristic learning of one whom\nhe had taken to be a mere connoisseur in art and writer of plays\nfor the theatre, concluded that discretion was the surest kind of\nvalour, and desisted from further attacks.",
        "Lessing’s triumph came opportunely; for already the ministry of\nBrunswick had not only confiscated the Fragments, but had\nprohibited him from publishing anything more on the subject\nwithout first obtaining express authority to do so. His last\nreplies to Goetze were published at Hamburg; and as he held\nhimself in readiness to depart from Wolfenbuttel, he wrote to\nseveral friends that he had conceived the design of a drama, with\nwhich he would tear the theologians in pieces more than with a\ndozen Fragments. “I will try and see,” said he, “if they will let\nme preach in peace from my old pulpit, the theatre.” In this way\noriginated “Nathan the Wise.” But it in no way answered to the\nexpectations either of Lessing’s friends or of his enemies. Both\nthe one and the other expected to see the controversy with Goetze\ncarried on, developed, and generalized in the poem. They looked\nfor a satirical comedy, in which orthodoxy should be held up for\nscathing ridicule, or at least for a direful tragedy, the moral\nof which, like that of the great poem of Lucretius, should be",
        "Had Lessing produced such a poem, he would doubtless have\ngratified his free-thinking friends and wreaked due literary\nvengeance upon his theological persecutors. He would, perhaps,\nhave given articulate expression to the radicalism of his own\ntime, and, like Voltaire, might have constituted himself the\nleader of the age, the incarnation of its most conspicuous\ntendencies. But Lessing did nothing of the kind; and the\nexpectations formed of him by friends and enemies alike show how\nlittle he was understood by either. “Nathan the Wise” was, as we\nshall see, in the eighteenth century an entirely new phenomenon;\nand its author was the pioneer of a quite new religious\nphilosophy.",
        "Reimarus, the able author of the Fragments, in his attack upon\nthe evidences of revealed religion, had taken the same ground as\nVoltaire and the old English deists. And when we have said this,\nwe have sufficiently defined his position, for the tenets of the\ndeists are at the present day pretty well known, and are,\nmoreover, of very little vital importance, having long since been\nsupplanted by a more just and comprehensive philosophy. Reimarus\naccepted neither miracles nor revelation; but in accordance with\nthe rudimentary state of criticism in his time, he admitted the\nhistorical character of the earliest Christian records, and was\nthus driven to the conclusion that those writings must have been\nfraudulently composed. How such a set of impostors as the\napostles must on this hypothesis have been, should have succeeded\nin inspiring large numbers of their contemporaries with higher\nand grander religious notions than had ever before been\nconceived; how they should have laid the foundations of a\ntheological system destined to hold together the most enlightened\nand progressive portion of human society for seventeen or\neighteen centuries,—does not seem to have entered his mind.\nAgainst such attacks as this, orthodoxy was comparatively safe;\nfor whatever doubt might be thrown upon some of its leading\ndogmas, the system as a whole was more consistent and rational\nthan any of the theories which were endeavouring to supplant it.\nAnd the fact that nearly all the great thinkers of the eighteenth\ncentury adopted this deistic hypothesis, shows, more than\nanything else, the crudeness of their psychological knowledge,\nand their utter lack of what is called “the historical sense.”",
        "Lessing at once saw the weak point in Reimarus’s argument, but\nhis method of disposing of it differed signally from that adopted\nby his orthodox contemporaries. The more advanced German\ntheologians of that day, while accepting the New Testament\nrecords as literally historical, were disposed to rationalize the\naccounts of miracles contained in them, in such a way as to get\nrid of any presumed infractions of the laws of nature. This\nmethod of exegesis, which reached its perfection in Paulus, is\ntoo well known to need describing. Its unsatisfactory character\nwas clearly shown, thirty years ago, by Strauss, and it is now\ngenerally abandoned, though some traces of it may still be seen\nin the recent works of Renan. Lessing steadily avoided this\nmethod of interpretation. He had studied Spinoza to some purpose,\nand the outlines of Biblical criticism laid down by that\nremarkable thinker Lessing developed into a system wonderfully\nlike that now adopted by the Tubingen school. The cardinal\nresults which Baur has reached within the past generation were\nnearly all hinted at by Lessing, in his commentaries on the\nFragments. The distinction between the first three, or synoptic\ngospels, and the fourth, the later age of the fourth, and the\nmethod of composition of the first three, from earlier documents\nand from oral tradition, are all clearly laid down by him. The\ndistinct points of view from which the four accounts were\ncomposed, are also indicated,—the Judaizing disposition of\n\"Matthew,” the Pauline sympathies of “Luke,” the compromising or\nPetrine tendencies of “Mark,” and the advanced Hellenic character\nof “John.” Those best acquainted with the results of modern\ncriticism in Germany will perhaps be most surprised at finding\nsuch speculations in a book written many years before either\nStrauss or Baur were born.",
        "But such results, as might have been expected, did not satisfy\nthe pastor Goetze or the public which sympathized with him. The\nvaliant pastor unhesitatingly declared that he read the\nobjections which Lessing opposed to the Fragmentist with more\nhorror and disgust than the Fragments themselves; and in the\nteeth of the printed comments he declared that the editor was\ncraftily upholding his author in his deistical assault upon\nChristian theology. The accusation was unjust, because untrue.\nThere could be no genuine cooperation between a mere iconoclast\nlike Reimarus, and a constructive critic like Lessing. But the\nconfusion was not an unnatural one on Goetze’s part, and I cannot\nagree with M. Fontanes in taking it as convincing proof of the\npastor’s wrong-headed perversity. It appears to me that Goetze\ninterpreted Lessing’s position quite as accurately as M.\nFontanes. The latter writer thinks that Lessing was a Christian\nof the liberal school since represented by Theodore Parker in\nthis country and by M. Reville in France; that his real object\nwas to defend and strengthen the Christian religion by relieving\nit of those peculiar doctrines which to the freethinkers of his\ntime were a stumbling-block and an offence. And, in spite of\nLessing’s own declarations, he endeavours to show that he was an\nordinary theist,—a follower of Leibnitz rather than of Spinoza.\nBut I do not think he has made out his case. Lessing’s own\nconfession to Jacobi is unequivocal enough, and cannot well be\nargued away. In that remarkable conversation, held toward the\nclose of his life, he indicates clearly enough that his faith was\nneither that of the ordinary theist, the atheist, nor the\npantheist, but that his religious theory of the universe was\nidentical with that suggested by Spinoza, adopted by Goethe, and\nrecently elaborated in the first part of the “First Principles\"\nof Mr. Herbert Spencer. Moreover, while Lessing cannot be\nconsidered an antagonist of Christianity, neither did he assume\nthe attitude of a defender. He remained outside the theological\narena; looking at theological questions from the point of view of\na layman, or rather, as M. Cherbuliez has happily expressed it,\nof a Pagan. His mind was of decidedly antique structure. He had\nthe virtues of paganism: its sanity, its calmness, and its\nprobity; but of the tenderness of Christianity, and its\nquenchless aspirations after an indefinable ideal, of that\nfeeling which has incarnated itself in Gothic cathedrals, masses\nand oratorios, he exhibited but scanty traces. His intellect was\nabove all things self-consistent and incorruptible. He had that\nimperial good-sense which might have formed the ideal alike of\nHorace and of Epictetus. No clandestine preference for certain\nconclusions could make his reason swerve from the straight paths\nof logic. And he examined and rejected the conclusions of\nReimarus in the same imperturbable spirit with which he examined\nand rejected the current theories of the French classic drama.",
        "Such a man can have had but little in common with a preacher like\nTheodore Parker, or with a writer like M. Fontanes, whose whole\nbook is a noble specimen of lofty Christian eloquence. His\nattribute was light, not warmth. He scrutinized, but did not\nattack or defend. He recognized the transcendent merits of the\nChristian faith, but made no attempt to reinstate it where it had\nseemed to suffer shock. It was therefore with the surest of\ninstincts, with that same instinct of self-preservation which had\nonce led the Church to anathematize Galileo, that Goetze.\nproclaimed Lessing a more dangerous foe to orthodoxy than the\ndeists who had preceded him. Controversy, he doubtless thought,\nmay be kept up indefinitely, and blows given and returned\nforever; but before the steady gaze of that scrutinizing eye\nwhich one of us shall find himself able to stand erect? It has\nbecome fashionable to heap blame and ridicule upon those who\nviolently defend an antiquated order of things; and Goetze has\nreceived at the hands of posterity his full share of abuse. His\nwrath contrasted unfavourably with Lessing’s calmness; and it was\nhis misfortune to have taken up arms against an opponent who\nalways knew how to keep the laugh upon his own side. For my own\npart I am constrained to admire the militant pastor, as Lessing\nhimself admired him. From an artistic point of view he is not an\nuninteresting figure to contemplate. And although his attempts to\nawaken persecution were reprehensible, yet his ardour in\ndefending what he believed to be vital truth is none the less to\nbe respected. He had the acuteness to see that Lessing’s\nrefutation of deism did not make him a Christian, while the new\nviews proposed as a substitute for those of Reimarus were such as\nGoetze and his age could in no wise comprehend.",
        "Lessing’s own views of dogmatic religion are to be found in his\nwork entitled, “The Education of the Human Race.” These views\nhave since so far become the veriest commonplaces of criticism,\nthat one can hardly realize that, only ninety years ago, they\nshould have been regarded as dangerous paradoxes. They may be\nsummed up in the statement that all great religions are good in\ntheir time and place; that, “as there is a soul of goodness in\nthings evil, so also there is a soul of truth in things\nerroneous.” According to Lessing, the successive phases of\nreligious belief constitute epochs in the mental evolution of the\nhuman race. So that the crudest forms of theology, even\nfetishism, now to all appearance so utterly revolting, and\npolytheism, so completely inadequate, have once been the best,\nthe natural and inevitable results of man’s reasoning powers and\nappliances for attaining truth. The mere fact that a system of\nreligious thought has received the willing allegiance of large\nmasses of men shows that it must have supplied some consciously\nfelt want, some moral or intellectual craving. And the mere fact\nthat knowledge and morality are progressive implies that each\nsuccessive system may in due course of time be essentially\nmodified or finally supplanted. The absence of any reference to a\nfuture state of retribution, in the Pentateuch and generally in\nthe sacred writings of the Jews, and the continual appeal to\nhopes and fears of a worldly character, have been pronounced by\ndeists an irremediable defect in the Jewish religion. It is\nprecisely this, however, says Lessing, which constitutes one of\nits signal excellences. “That thy days may be long in the land\nwhich Jehovah thy God giveth thee,” was an appeal which the\nuncivilized Jew could understand, and which could arouse him to\naction; while the need of a future world, to rectify the\ninjustices of this, not yet being felt, the doctrine would have\nbeen of but little service. But in later Hebrew literature, many\nmagnificent passages revealed the despair felt by prophet and\nthinker over the insoluble problem presented by the evil fate of\nthe good and the triumphant success of the wicked; and a solution\nwas sought in the doctrine of a Messianic kingdom, until\nChristianity with its proclamation of a future life set the\nquestion entirely aside. By its appeal to what has been aptly\ntermed “other-worldliness,” Christianity immeasurably intensified\nhuman responsibility, besides rendering clearer its nature and\nlimits. But according to Lessing, yet another step remains to be\ntaken; and here we come upon the gulf which separates him from\nmen of the stamp of Theodore Parker. For, says Lessing, the\nappeal to unearthly rewards and punishments is after all an\nappeal to our lower feelings; other-worldliness is but a refined\nselfishness; and we are to cherish virtue for its own sake not\nbecause it will lead us to heaven. Here is the grand principle of\nStoicism. Lessing believed, with Mr. Mill, that the less we think\nabout getting rewarded either on earth or in heaven the better.\nHe was cast in the same heroic mould as Muhamad Efendi, who when\nled to the stake exclaimed: “Though I have no hope of recompense\nhereafter, yet the love of truth constraineth me to die in its\ndefence!”",
        "With the truth or completeness of these views of Lessing we are\nnot here concerned; our business being not to expound our own\nopinions, but to indicate as clearly as possible Lessing’s\nposition. Those who are familiar with the general philosophical\nspirit of the present age, as represented by writers otherwise so\ndifferent as Littre and Sainte-Beuve, will best appreciate the\npower and originality of these speculations. Coming in the last\ncentury, amid the crudities of deism, they made a well-defined\nepoch. They inaugurated the historical method of criticism, and\nthey robbed the spirit of intolerance of its only philosophical\nexcuse for existing. Hitherto the orthodox had been intolerant\ntoward the philosophers because they considered them heretics;\nand the philosophers had been intolerant toward the orthodox\nbecause they considered them fools. To Voltaire it naturally\nseemed that a man who could believe in the reality of miracles\nmust be what in French is expressively termed a sot. But\nhenceforth, to the disciple of Lessing, men of all shade of\nopinion were but the representatives and exponents of different\nphases in the general evolution of human intelligence, not\nnecessarily to be disliked or despised if they did not happen to\nrepresent the maturest phase.",
        "Religion, therefore, from this point of view, becomes clearly\ndemarcated from theology. It consists no longer in the mental\nassent to certain prescribed formulas, but in the moral obedience\nto the great rule of life; the great commandment laid down and\nillustrated by the Founder of the Christian religion, and\nconcerning which the profoundest modern philosophy informs us\nthat the extent to which a society has learned to conform to it\nis the test and gauge of the progress in civilization which that\nsociety has achieved. The command “to love one another,” to check\nthe barbarous impulses inherited from the pre-social state, while\ngiving free play to the beneficent impulses needful for the\nultimate attainment of social equilibrium,—or as Tennyson\nphrases it, to “move upward, working out the beast, and letting\nthe ape and tiger die,\"—was, in Lessing’s view, the task set\nbefore us by religion. The true religious feeling was thus, in\nhis opinion, what the author of “Ecce Homo” has finely termed\n\"the enthusiasm of humanity.” And we shall find no better\nlanguage than that of the writer just mentioned, in which to\ndescribe Lessing’s conception of faith:—",
        "“He who, when goodness is impressively put before him, exhibits\nan instinctive loyalty to it, starts forward to take its side,\ntrusts himself to it, such a man has faith, and the root of the\nmatter is in such a man. He may have habits of vice, but the\nloyal and faithful instinct in him will place him above many that\npractice virtue. He may be rude in thought and character, but he\nwill unconsciously gravitate toward what is right. Other virtues\ncan scarcely thrive without a fine natural organization and a\nhappy training. But the most neglected and ungifted of men may\nmake a beginning with faith. Other virtues want civilization, a\ncertain amount of knowledge, a few books; but in half-brutal\ncountenances faith will light up a glimmer of nobleness. The\nsavage, who can do little else, can wonder and worship and\nenthusiastically obey. He who cannot know what is right can know\nthat some one else knows; he who has no law may still have a\nmaster; he who is incapable of justice may be capable of\nfidelity; he who understands little may have his sins forgiven\nbecause he loves much.”",
        "Such was Lessing’s religion, so far as it can be ascertained from\nthe fragmentary writings which he has left on the subject.\nUndoubtedly it lacked completeness. The opinions which we have\nhere set down, though constituting something more than a mere\ntheory of morality, certainly do not constitute a complete theory\nof religion. Our valiant knight has examined but one side of the\nshield,—the bright side, turned toward us, whose marvellous\ninscriptions the human reason can by dint of unwearied effort\ndecipher. But the dark side, looking out upon infinity, and\ncovered with hieroglyphics the meaning of which we can never\nknow, he has quite forgotten to consider. Yet it is this side\nwhich genuine religious feeling ever seeks to contemplate. It is\nthe consciousness that there is about us an omnipresent Power, in\nwhich we live and move and have our being, eternally manifesting\nitself throughout the whole range of natural phenomena, which has\never disposed men to be religious, and lured them on in the vain\neffort to construct adequate theological systems. We may, getting\nrid of the last traces of fetishism, eliminate arbitrary volition\nas much as we will or can. But there still remains the\nconsciousness of a divine Life in the universe, of a Power which\nis beyond and above our comprehension, whose goings out and\ncomings in no man can follow. The more we know, the more we reach\nout for that which we cannot know. And who can realize this so\nvividly as the scientific philosopher? For our knowledge being,\naccording to the familiar comparison, like a brilliant sphere,\nthe more we increase it the greater becomes the number of\nperipheral points at which we are confronted by the impenetrable\ndarkness beyond. I believe that this restless yearning,—vague\nenough in the description, yet recognizable by all who, communing\nwith themselves or with nature, have felt it,—this constant\nseeking for what cannot be found, this persistent knocking at\ngates which, when opened, but reveal others yet to be passed,\nconstitutes an element which no adequate theory of religion can\noverlook. But of this we find nothing in Lessing. With him all is\nsunny, serene, and pagan. Not the dim aisle of a vast cathedral,\nbut the symmetrical portico of an antique temple, is the\nworshipping-place into which he would lead us.",
        "But if Lessing’s theology must be considered imperfect, it is\nnone the less admirable as far as it goes. With its peculiar\ndoctrines of love and faith, it teaches a morality far higher\nthan any that Puritanism ever dreamed of. And with its theory of\ndevelopment it cuts away every possible logical basis for\nintolerance. It is this theology to which Lessing has given\nconcrete expression in his immortal poem of “Nathan.”",
        "The central idea of “Nathan” was suggested to Lessing by\nBoccaccio’s story of “The Three Rings,” which is supposed to have\nhad a Jewish origin. Saladin, pretending to be inspired by a\nsudden, imperious whim, such as is “not unbecoming in a Sultan,\"\ndemands that Nathan shall answer him on the spur of the moment\nwhich of the three great religions then known—Judaism,\nMohammedanism, Christianity—is adjudged by reason to be the true\none. For a moment the philosopher is in a quandary. If he does\nnot pronounce in favour of his own religion, Judaism, he\nstultifies himself; but if he does not award the precedence to\nMohammedanism, he will apparently insult his sovereign. With true\nOriental tact he escapes from the dilemma by means of a parable.\nThere was once a man, says Nathan, who possessed a ring of\ninestimable value. Not only was the stone which it contained\nincomparably fine, but it possessed the marvellous property of\nrendering its owner agreeable both to God and to men. The old man\nbequeathed this ring to that one of his sons whom he loved the\nmost; and the son, in turn, made a similar disposition of it. So\nthat, passing from hand to hand, the ring finally came into the\npossession of a father who loved his three sons equally well.\nUnto which one should he leave it? To get rid of the perplexity,\nhe had two other rings made by a jeweller, exactly like the\noriginal, and to each of his three sons he bequeathed one. Each\nthen thinking that he had obtained the true talisman, they began\nviolently to quarrel, and after long contention agreed to carry\ntheir dispute before the judge. But the judge said: “Quarrelsome\nfellows! You are all three of you cheated cheats. Your three\nrings are alike counterfeit. For the genuine ring is lost, and to\nconceal the loss, your father had made these three substitutes.\"\nAt this unexpected denouement the Sultan breaks out in\nexclamations of delight; and it is interesting to learn that when\nthe play was brought upon the stage at Constantinople a few years\nago, the Turkish audience was similarly affected. There is in the\nstory that quiet, stealthy humour which is characteristic of many\nmediaeval apologues, and in which Lessing himself loved to deal.\nIt is humour of the kind which hits the mark, and reveals the\ntruth. In a note upon this passage, Lessing himself said: “The\nopinion of Nathan upon all positive religions has for a long time\nbeen my own.” Let him who has the genuine ring show it by making\nhimself loved of God and man. This is the central idea of the\npoem. It is wholly unlike the iconoclasm of the deists, and,\ncoming in the eighteenth century, it was like a veritable\nevangel.",
        "“Nathan” was not brought out until three years after Lessing’s\ndeath, and it kept possession of the stage for but a short time.\nIn a dramatic point of view, it has hardly any merits. Whatever\nplot there is in it is weak and improbable. The decisive\nincidents seem to be brought in like the deus ex machina of the\nlater Greek drama. There is no movement, no action, no\ndevelopment. The characters are poetically but not dramatically\nconceived. Considered as a tragedy, “Nathan” would be weak;\nconsidered as a comedy, it would be heavy. With full knowledge of\nthese circumstances, Lessing called it not a drama, but a\ndramatic poem; and he might have called it still more accurately\na didactic poem, for the only feature which it has in common with\nthe drama is that the personages use the oratio directa.",
        "“Nathan” is a didactic poem: it is not a mere philosophic\ntreatise written in verse, like the fragments of Xenophanes. Its\nlessons are conveyed concretely and not abstractly; and its\ncharacters are not mere lay figures, but living poetical\nconceptions. Considered as a poem among classic German poems, it\nmust rank next to, though immeasurably below, Goethe’s “Faust.”",
        "There are two contrasted kinds of genius, the poetical and the\nphilosophical; or, to speak yet more generally, the artistic and\nthe critical. The former is distinguished by a concrete, the\nlatter by an abstract, imagination. The former sees things\nsynthetically, in all their natural complexity; the latter pulls\nthings to pieces analytically, and scrutinizes their relations.\nThe former sees a tree in all its glory, where the latter sees an\nexogen with a pair of cotyledons. The former sees wholes, where\nthe latter sees aggregates.",
        "Corresponding with these two kinds of genius there are two\nclasses of artistic productions. When the critical genius writes\na poem or a novel, he constructs his plot and his characters in\nconformity to some prearranged theory, or with a view to\nillustrate some favourite doctrine. When he paints a picture, he\nfirst thinks how certain persons would look under certain given\ncircumstances, and paints them accordingly. When he writes a\npiece of music, he first decides that this phrase expresses joy,\nand that phrase disappointment, and the other phrase disgust, and\nhe composes accordingly. We therefore say ordinarily that he does\nnot create, but only constructs and combines. It is far different\nwith the artistic genius, who, without stopping to think, sees\nthe picture and hears the symphony with the eyes and ears of\nimagination, and paints and plays merely what he has seen and\nheard. When Dante, in imagination, arrived at the lowest circle\nof hell, where traitors like Judas and Brutus are punished, he\ncame upon a terrible frozen lake, which, he says,—",
        "I have always considered this line a marvellous instance of the\nintensity of Dante’s imagination. It shows, too, how Dante\ncomposed his poem. He did not take counsel of himself and say:\n\"Go to, let us describe the traitors frozen up to their necks in\na dismal lake, for that will be most terrible.” But the picture\nof the lake, in all its iciness, with the haggard faces staring\nout from its glassy crust, came unbidden before his mind with\nsuch intense reality that, for the rest of his life, he could not\nlook at a frozen pool without a shudder of horror. He described\nit exactly as he saw it; and his description makes us shudder who\nread it after all the centuries that have intervened. So Michael\nAngelo, a kindred genius, did not keep cutting and chipping away,\nthinking how Moses ought to look, and what sort of a nose he\nought to have, and in what position his head might best rest upon\nhis shoulders. But, he looked at the rectangular block of Carrara\nmarble, and beholding Moses grand and lifelike within it, knocked\naway the environing stone, that others also might see the mighty\nfigure. And so Beethoven, an artist of the same colossal order,\nwrote out for us those mysterious harmonies which his ear had for\nthe first time heard; and which, in his mournful old age, it\nheard none the less plainly because of its complete physical\ndeafness. And in this way Shakespeare wrote his “Othello\";\nspinning out no abstract thoughts about jealousy and its fearful\neffects upon a proud and ardent nature, but revealing to us the\nliving concrete man, as his imperial imagination had\nspontaneously fashioned him.",
        "Modern psychology has demonstrated that this is the way in which\nthe creative artistic imagination proceeds. It has proved that a\nvast portion of all our thinking goes on unconsciously; and that\nthe results may arise into consciousness piecemeal and gradually,\nchecking each other as they come; or that they may come all at\nonce, with all the completeness and definiteness of perceptions\npresented from without. The former is the case with the critical,\nand the latter with the artistic intellect. And this we recognize\nimperfectly when we talk of a genius being “inspired.” All of us\nprobably have these two kinds of imagination to a certain extent.\nIt is only given to a few supremely endowed persons like Goethe\nto possess them both to an eminent degree. Perhaps of no other\nman can it be said that he was a poet of the first order, and as\ngreat a critic as poet.",
        "It is therefore apt to be a barren criticism which studies the\nworks of creative geniuses in order to ascertain what theory lies\nbeneath them. How many systems of philosophy, how many subtle\nspeculations, have we not seen fathered upon Dante, Cervantes,\nShakespeare, and Goethe! Yet their works are, in a certain sense,\ngreater than any systems. They partake of the infinite complexity\nand variety of nature, and no more than nature itself can they be\nnarrowed down to the limits of a precise formula.",
        "Lessing was wont to disclaim the title of poet; but, as Goethe\nsaid, his immortal works refute him. He had not only poetical,\nbut dramatic genius; and his “Emilia Galotti” has kept the stage\nuntil to-day. Nevertheless, he knew well what he meant when he\nsaid that he was more of a critic than a poet. His genius was\nmainly of the critical order; and his great work, “Nathan the\nWise,” was certainly constructed rather than created. It was\nintended to convey a doctrine, and was carefully shaped for the\npurpose. And when we have pronounced it the greatest of all poems\nthat have been written for a set purpose, and admit of being\nexpressed in a definite formula, we have classified it with\nsufficient accuracy.",
        "For an analysis of the characters in the poem, nothing can be\nbetter than the essay by Kuno Fischer, appended to the present\nvolume. The work of translation has been admirably done; and\nthanks are due to Miss Frothingham for her reproduction of this\nbeautiful poem.",

        "History, says Sainte-Beuve, is in great part a set of fables\nwhich people agree to believe in. And, on reading books like the\npresent, one certainly needs a good deal of that discipline\nacquired by long familiarity with vexed historical questions, in\norder to check the disposition to accept the great critic’s\nironical remark in sober earnest. Much of what is currently\naccredited as authentic history is in fact a mixture of flattery\nand calumny, myth and fable. Yet in this set of fables, whatever\nmay have been the case in past times, people will no longer agree\nto believe. During the present century the criticism of recorded\nevents has gone far toward assuming the developed and\nsystematized aspect of a science, and canons of belief have been\nestablished. which it is not safe to disregard. Great\noccurrences, such as the Trojan War and the Siege of Thebes, not\nlong ago faithfully described by all historians of Greece, have\nbeen found to be part of the common mythical heritage of the\nAryan nations. Achilleus and Helena, Oidipous and Iokasta, Oinone\nand Paris, have been discovered in India and again in\nScandinavia, and so on, until their nonentity has become the\nlegitimate inference from their very ubiquity. Legislators like\nRomulus and Numa, inventors like Kadmos, have evaporated into\netymologies. Whole legions of heroes, dynasties of kings, and\nadulteresses as many as Dante saw borne on the whirlwind, have\nvanished from the face of history, and terrible has been the\nhavoc in the opening pages of our chronological tables. Nor is it\nprimitive history alone which has been thus metamorphosed.\nCharacters unduly exalted or defamed by party spirit are daily\nbeing set before us in their true, or at least in a truer, light.\nWhat Mr. Froude has done for Henry VIII. we know; and he might\nhave done more if he had not tried to do so much. Humpbacked\nRichard turns out to have been one of the handsomest kings that\never sat on the throne of England. Edward I., in his dealings\nwith Scotland, is seen to have been scrupulously just; while the\ndignity of the patriot hero Wallace has been somewhat impaired.\nElizabeth is proved to have befriended the false Mary Stuart much\nlonger than was consistent with her personal safety. Eloquent\nCicero has been held up as an object of contempt; and even\nweighty Tacitus has been said to owe much of his reputation to\nhis ability to give false testimony with a grave face. It has\nlately been suspected that gloomy Tiberius, apart from his\ngloominess, may have been rather a good fellow; not so licentious\nas puritanical, not cruel so much as exceptionally merciful,—a\nrare general, a sagacious statesman, and popular to boot with all\nhis subjects save the malignant oligarchy which he consistently\nsnubbed, and which took revenge on him by writing his life. And,\nto crown all, even Catiline, abuser of our patience, seducer of\nvestal nuns, and drinker of children’s blood,—whose very name\nsuggests murder, incest, and robbery,—even Catiline has found an\nable defender in Professor Beesly. It is claimed that Catiline\nwas a man of great abilities and average good character, a\nwell-calumniated leader of the Marian party which Caesar\nafterwards led to victory, and that his famous plot for burning\nRome never existed save in the unscrupulous Ciceronian fancy. And\nthose who think it easy to refute these conclusions of Professor\nBeesly had better set to work and try it. Such are a few of the\nsurprising questions opened by recent historical research; and in\nthe face of them the public is quite excusable if it declares\nitself at a loss what to believe.",
        "These, however, are cases in which criticism has at least made\nsome show of ascertaining the truth and detecting the causes of\nthe prevalent misconception. That men like Catiline and Tiberius\nshould have had their characters blackened is quite easily\nexplicable. President Johnson would have little better chance of\nobtaining justice at the hands of posterity, if the most widely\nread history of his administration should happen to be written by\na radical member of the Rump Congress. But the cases which Mr.\nDelepierre invites us to contemplate are of a different\ncharacter. They come neither under the head of myths nor under\nthat of misrepresentations. Some of them are truly vexed\nquestions which it may perhaps always be impossible\nsatisfactorily to solve. Others may be dealt with more easily,\nbut afford no clew to the origin of the popularly received error.\nLet us briefly examine a few of Mr. Delepierre’s “difficulties.\"\nAnd first, because simplest, we will take the case of the\nAlexandrian Library.",
        "Every one has heard how Amrou, after his conquest of Egypt, sent\nto Caliph Omar to know what should be done with the Alexandrian\nLibrary. “If the books agree with the Koran,” said the Caliph,\n\"they are superfluous; if they contradict it, they are damnable;\nin either case, destroy them.” So the books were taken and used\nto light the fires which heated water for the baths; and so vast\nwas the number that, used in this way, they lasted six months!\nAll this happened because John the Grammarian was over-anxious\nenough to request that the books might be preserved, and thus\ndrew Amrou’s attention to them. Great has been the obloquy poured\nupon Omar for this piece of vandalism, and loud has been the\nmourning over the treasures of ancient science and literature\nsupposed to have been irrecoverably lost in this ignominious\nconflagration Theologians, Catholic and Protestant, have been\nfond of quoting it as an instance of the hostility of\nMahometanism to knowledge, and we have even heard an edifying\nsermon preached about it. On seeing the story put to such uses,\none feels sometimes like using the ad hominem argument, and\nquoting the wholesale destruction of pagan libraries under\nValens, the burning of books by the Latin stormers of\nConstantinople, the alleged annihilation of 100,000 volumes by\nGenoese crusaders at Tripoli, the book-burning exploits of\nTorquemada, the bonfire of 80,000 valuable Arabic manuscripts,\nlighted up in the square of Granada by order of Cardinal Ximenes,\nand the irreparable cremation of Aztec writings by the first\nChristian bishops of Mexico. These examples, with perhaps others\nwhich do not now occur to us, might be applied in just though\nungentle retort by Mahometan doctors. Yet the most direct\nrejoinder would probably not occur to them: the Alexandrian\nLibrary was NOT destroyed by the orders of Omar, and the whole\nstory is a figment!",
        "The very pithiness of it, so characteristic of the excellent but\nbigoted Omar, is enough to cast suspicion upon it. De Quincey\ntells us that “if a saying has a proverbial fame, the probability\nis that it was never said.” How many amusing stories stand a\nchance of going down to posterity as the inventions of President\nLincoln, of which, nevertheless, he is doubtless wholly innocent!\nHow characteristic was Caesar’s reply to the frightened pilot!\nYet in all probability Caesar never made it.",
        "Now for the evidence. Alexandria was captured by Armrou in 640.\nThe story of the burning of the library occurs for the first time\nin the works of Abulpharagius, who flourished in 1264. Six\nhundred years had elapsed. It is as if a story about the crusades\nof Louis IX. were to be found for the first time in the writings\nof Mr. Bancroft. The Byzantine historians were furiously angry\nwith the Saracens; why did they, one and all, neglect to mention\nsuch an outrageous piece of vandalism? Their silence must be\nconsidered quite conclusive. Moreover we know “that the caliphs\nhad forbidden under severe penalties the destruction” of Jewish\nand Christian books, a circumstance wholly inconsistent with this\nfamous story. And finally, what a mediaeval recklessness of dates\nis shown in lugging into the story John the Grammarian, who was\ndead and in his grave when Alexandria was taken by Amrou!",
        "But the chief item of proof remains to be mentioned. The Saracens\ndid not burn the library, because there was no library there for\nthem to burn! It had been destroyed just two hundred and fifty\nyears before by a rabble of monks, incited by the patriarch\nTheophilus, who saw in such a vast collection of pagan literature\na perpetual insult and menace to religion. In the year 390 this\nturbulent bigot sacked the temple of Serapis, where the books\nwere kept, and drove out the philosophers who lodged there. Of\nthis violent deed we have contemporary evidence, for Orosius\ntells us that less than fifteen years afterwards, while passing\nthrough Alexandria, he saw the empty shelves. This fact disposes\nof the story.",
        "Passing from Egypt to France, and from the seventh century to the\nfifteenth, we meet with a much more difficult problem. That\nJeanne d’Arc was burnt at the stake, at Rouen, on the 30th of\nMay, 1431, and her bones and ashes thrown into the Seine, is\ngenerally supposed to be as indisputable as any event in modern\nhistory. Such is, however, hardly the case. Plausible evidence\nhas been brought to prove that Jeanne d’Arc was never burnt at\nthe stake, but lived to a ripe age, and was even happily married\nto a nobleman of high rank and reputation. We shall abridge Mr.\nDelepierre’s statement of this curious case.",
        "In the archives of Metz, Father Vignier discovered the following\nremarkable entry: “In the year 1436, Messire Phlin Marcou was\nSheriff of Metz, and on the 20th day of May of the aforesaid year\ncame the maid Jeanne, who had been in France, to La Grange of\nOrmes, near St. Prive, and was taken there to confer with any one\nof the sieurs of Metz, and she called herself Claude; and on the\nsame day there came to see her there her two brothers, one of\nwhom was a knight, and was called Messire Pierre, and the other\n’petit Jehan,’ a squire, and they thought that she had been\nburnt, but as soon as they saw her they recognized her and she\nthem. And on Monday, the 21st day of the said month, they took\ntheir sister with them to Boquelon, and the sieur Nicole, being a\nknight, gave her a stout stallion of the value of thirty francs,\nand a pair of saddle-cloths; the sieur Aubert Boulle, a\nriding-hood, the sieur Nicole Groguet, a sword; and the said\nmaiden mounted the said horse nimbly, and said several things to\nthe sieur Nicole by which he well understood that it was she who\nhad been in France; and she was recognized by many tokens to be\nthe maid Jeanne of France who escorted King Charles to Rheims,\nand several declared that she had been burnt in Normandy, and she\nspoke mostly in parables. She afterwards returned to the town of\nMarnelle for the feast of Pentecost, and remained there about\nthree weeks, and then set off to go to Notre Dame d’Alliance. And\nwhen she wished to leave, several of Metz went to see her at the\nsaid Marnelle and gave her several jewels, and they knew well\nthat she was the maid Jeanne of France; and she then went to\nErlon, in the Duchy of Luxembourg, where she was thronged,....\nand there was solemnized the marriage of Monsieur de Hermoise,\nknight, and the said maid Jeanne, and afterwards the said sieur\nHermoise, with his wife, the Maid, came to live at Metz, in the\nhouse the said sieur had, opposite St. Seglenne, and remained\nthere until it pleased them to depart.”",
        "This is surprising enough; but more remains behind. Dining\nshortly afterwards with M. des Armoises, member of one of the\noldest families in Lorraine, Father Vignier was invited to look\nover the family archives, that he might satisfy his curiosity\nregarding certain ancestors of his host. And on looking over the\nfamily register, what was his astonishment at finding a contract\nof marriage between Robert des Armoises, Knight, and Jeanne\nd’Arcy, the so-called Maid of Orleans!",
        "In 1740, some time after these occurrences, there was found, in\nthe town hall of Orleans, a bill of one Jacques l’Argentier, of\nthe year 1436, in which mention is made of a small sum paid for\nrefreshments furnished to a messenger who had brought letters\nfrom the Maid of Orleans, and of twelve livres given to Jean du\nLis, brother of Jeanne d’Arc, to help him pay the expenses of his\njourney back to his sister. Then come two charges which we shall\ntranslate literally. “To the sieur de Lis, 18th October, 1436,\nfor a journey which he made through the said city while on his\nway to the Maid, who was then at Erlon in Luxembourg, and for\ncarrying letters from Jeanne the Maid to the King at Loicher,\nwhere he was then staying, six livres.” And again: “To Renard\nBrune, 25th July, 1435, at evening, for paying the hire of a\nmessenger who was carrying letters from Jeanne the Maid, and was\non his way to William Beliers, bailiff of Troyes, two livres.”",
        "As no doubt has been thrown upon the genuineness of these\ndocuments, it must be considered established that in 1436, five\nyears after the public execution at Rouen, a young woman,\nbelieved to be the real Jeanne d’Arc, was alive in Lorraine and\nwas married to a M. Hermoises or Armoises. She may, of course,\nhave been an impostor; but in this case it is difficult to\nbelieve that her brothers, Jean and Pierre, and the people of\nLorraine, where she was well known, would not have detected the\nimposture at once. And that Jean du Lis, during a familiar\nintercourse of at least several months, as indicated in the above\nextracts, should have continued to mistake a stranger for his own\nsister, with whom he had lived from childhood, seems a very\nabsurd supposition. Nor is it likely that an impostor would have\nexposed herself to such a formidable test. If it had been a bold\ncharlatan who, taking advantage of the quite general belief, to\nwhich we have ample testimony, that there was something more in\nthe execution at Rouen than was allowed to come to the surface,\nhad resolved to usurp for herself the honours due to the woman\nwho had saved France, she would hardly have gone at the outset to\na part of the country where the real Maid had spent nearly all\nher life. Her instant detection and exposure, perhaps a\ndisgraceful punishment, would have been inevitable. But if this\nperson were the real Jeanne, escaped from prison or returning\nfrom an exile dictated by prudence, what should she have done but\ngo straightway to the haunts of her childhood, where she might\nmeet once more her own friends and family?",
        "But the account does not end here. M. Wallon, in his elaborate\nhistory of Jeanne d’Arc, states that in 1436 the supposed Maid\nvisited France, and appears to have met some of the men-at-arms\nwith whom she had fought. In 1439 she came to Orleans, for in the\naccounts of the town we read, “July 28, for ten pints of wine\npresented to Jeanne des Armoises, 14 sous.” And on the day of her\ndeparture, the citizens of Orleans, by a special decree of the\ntown-council, presented her with 210 livres, “for the services\nwhich she had rendered to the said city during the siege.” At the\nsame time the annual ceremonies for the repose of her soul were,\nquite naturally, suppressed. Now we may ask if it is at all\nprobable that the people of Orleans, who, ten years before,\nduring the siege, must have seen the Maid day after day, and to\nwhom her whole appearance must have been perfectly familiar,\nwould have been likely to show such attentions as these to an\nimpostor? “In 1440,” says Mr. Delepierre, “the people so firmly\nbelieved that Jeanne d’Arc was still alive, and that another had\nbeen sacrificed in her place, that an adventuress who endeavoured\nto pass herself off as the Maid of Orleans was ordered by the\ngovernment to be exposed before the public on the marble stone of\nthe palace hall, in order to prove that she was an impostor. Why\nwere not such measures taken against the real Maid of Orleans,\nwho is mentioned in so many public documents, and who took no\npains to hide herself?”",
        "There is yet another document bearing on this case, drawn from\nthe accounts of the auditor of the Orleans estate, in the year\n1444, which we will here translate. “An island on the River Loire\nis restored to Pierre du Lis, knight, ’on account of the\nsupplication of the said Pierre, alleging that for the acquittal\nof his debt of loyalty toward our Lord the King and M. the Duke\nof Orleans, he left his country to come to the service of the\nKing and M. the Duke, accompanied by his sister, Jeanne the Maid,\nwith whom, down to the time of her departure, and since, unto the\npresent time, he has exposed his body and goods in the said\nservice, and in the King’s wars, both in resisting the former\nenemies of the kingdom who were besieging the town of Orleans,\nand since then in divers enterprises,’ &c., &c.” Upon this Mr.\nDelepierre justly remarks that the brother might have presented\nhis claims in a much stronger light, “if in 1444,” instead of\nsaying ’up to the time of her departure,’ he had brought forward\nthe martyrdom of his sister, as having been the means of saving\nFrance from the yoke of England.” The expression here cited and\nitalicized in the above translation, may indeed be held to refer\ndelicately to her death, but the particular French phrase\nemployed, “jusques a son absentement,” apparently excludes such\nan interpretation. The expression, on the other hand, might well\nrefer to Jeanne’s departure for Lorraine, and her marriage, after\nwhich there is no evidence that she returned to France, except\nfor brief visits. Thus a notable amount of evidence goes to show\nthat Jeanne was not put to death in 1431, as usually supposed,\nbut was alive, married, and flourishing in 1444. Upon this\nsupposition, certain alleged difficulties in the traditional\naccount are easily disposed of. Mr. Delepierre urges upon the\ntestimony of Perceval de Cagny, that at the execution in Rouen\n\"the victim’s face was covered when walking to the stake, while\nat the same time a spot had been chosen for the execution that\npermitted the populace to have a good view. Why this\ncontradiction? A place is chosen to enable the people to see\neverything, but the victim is carefully hidden from their sight.\"\nWhether otherwise explicable or not, this fact is certainly\nconsistent with the hypothesis that some other victim was\nsecretly substituted for Jeanne by the English authorities.",
        "We have thus far contented ourselves with presenting and\nre-enforcing Mr. Delepierre’s statement of the case. It is now\ntime to interpose a little criticism. We must examine our data\nsomewhat more closely, for vagueness of conception allows a\nlatitude to belief which accuracy of conception considerably\nrestricts.",
        "On the hypothesis of her survival, where was Jeanne, and what was\nshe doing all the time from her capture before Compiegne, May 24,\n1430, until her appearance at Metz, May 20, 1436? Mr. Delepierre\nreminds us that the Duke of Bedford, regent of France for the\nEnglish king, died in 1435, and “that most probably Jeanne d’Arc\nwas released from prison after this event.” Now this supposition\nlands us in a fatally absurd conclusion. We are, in fact, asked\nto believe that the English, while holding Jeanne fast in their\nclutches, gratuitously went through the horrid farce of burning\nsome one else in her stead; and that, after having thus\ninexplicably behaved, they further stultified themselves by\nletting her go scot-free, that their foolishness might be duly\nexposed and confuted. Such a theory is childish. If Jeanne d’Arc\never survived the 30th May, 1431, it was because she escaped from\nprison and succeeded in hiding herself until safer times. When\ncould she have done this? In a sortie from Compiegne, May 24,\n1430, she was thrown from her horse by a Picard archer and taken\nprisoner by the Bastard of Vendome, who sold her to John of\nLuxembourg. John kept her in close custody at Beaulieu until\nAugust. While there, she made two attempts to escape; first,\napparently, by running out through a door, when she was at once\ncaught by the guards; secondly, by jumping from a high window,\nwhen the shock of the fall was so great that she lay insensible\non the ground until discovered. She was then removed to\nBeaurevoir, where she remained until the beginning of November.\nBy this time, Philip “the Good,” Duke of Burgundy, had made up\nhis mind to sell her to the English for 10,000 francs; and Jeanne\nwas accordingly taken to Arras, and thence to Cotoy, where she\nwas delivered to the English by Philip’s officers. So far, all is\nclear; but here it may be asked, WAS she really delivered to the\nEnglish, or did Philip, pocketing his 10,000 francs, cheat and\ndefraud his allies with a counterfeit Jeanne? Such crooked\ndealing would have been in perfect keeping with his character.\nThough a far more agreeable and gentlemanly person, he was almost\nas consummate and artistic a rascal as his\ngreat-great-great-grandson and namesake, Philip II. of Spain. His\nduplicity was so unfathomable and his policy so obscure, that it\nwould be hardly safe to affirm a priori that he might not, for\nreasons best known to himself, have played a double game with his\nfriend the Duke of Bedford. On this hypothesis, he would of\ncourse keep Jeanne in close custody so long as there was any\nreason for keeping his treachery secret. But in 1436, after the\ndeath of Bedford and the final expulsion of the English from\nFrance, no harm could come from setting her at liberty.",
        "But as soon as we cease to reason a priori, this is seen to be,\nafter all, a lame hypothesis. No one can read the trial of Jeanne\nat Rouen, the questions that were put to her and the answers\nwhich she made, without being convinced that we are here dealing\nwith the genuine Maid and not with a substitute. The first step\nof a counterfeit Jeanne would have naturally been to save herself\nfrom the flames by revealing her true character. Moreover, among\nthe multitudes who saw her during her cruel trial, it is not\nlikely that none were acquainted with the true Jeanne’s voice and\nfeatures. We must therefore conclude that Jeanne d’Arc was really\nconsigned to the tender mercies of the English. About the 21st of\nNovember she was taken on horseback, strongly guarded, from Cotoy\nto Rouen, where the trial began January 9, 1431. On the 21st of\nFebruary she appeared before the court; on the 13th of March she\nwas examined in the prison by an inquisitor; and on May 24, the\nThursday after Pentecost, upon a scaffold conspicuously placed in\nthe Cemetery of St. Ouen, she publicly recanted, abjuring her\n\"heresies” and asking the Church’s pardon for her “witchcraft.\"\nWe may be sure that the Church dignitaries would not knowingly\nhave made such public display of a counterfeit Jeanne; nor could\nthey well have been deceived themselves under such circumstances.\nIt may indeed be said, to exhaust all possible suppositions, that\na young girl wonderfully similar in feature and voice to Jeanne\nd’Arc was palmed off upon the English by Duke Philip, and\nafterwards, on her trial, comported herself like the Maid,\ntrusting in this recantation to effect her release. But we\nconsider such an hypothesis extremely far-fetched, nor does it\naccord with the events which immediately followed. It seems\nhardly questionable that it was the real Jeanne who publicly\nrecanted on the 24th of May. This was only six days before the\nexecution. Four days after, on Monday the 28th, it was reported\nthat Jeanne had relapsed, that she had, in defiance of the\nChurch’s prohibition, clothed herself in male attire, which had\nbeen left in a convenient place by the authorities, expressly to\ntest her sincerity. On the next day but one, the woman purporting\nto be the Maid of Orleans was led out, with her face carefully\ncovered, and burnt at the stake.",
        "Here is the first combination of circumstances which bears a\nsuspicious look. It disposes of our Burgundy hypothesis, for a\nfalse Jeanne, after recanting to secure her safety, would never\nhave stultified herself by such a barefaced relapse. But the true\nJeanne, after recanting, might certainly have escaped. Some\ncompassionate guard, who before would have scrupled to assist her\nwhile under the ban of the Church, might have deemed himself\nexcusable for lending her his aid after she had been absolved.\nPostulating, then, that Jeanne escaped from Rouen between the\n24th and the 28th, how shall we explain what happened immediately\nafterward?",
        "The English feared Jeanne d’Arc as much as they hated her. She\nhad, by her mere presence at the head of the French army, turned\ntheir apparent triumph into ignominious defeat. In those days the\ntrue psychological explanation of such an event was by no means\nobvious. While the French attributed the result to celestial\ninterposition in their behalf, the English, equally ready to\nadmit its supernatural character, considered the powers of hell\nrather than those of heaven to have been the prime instigators.\nIn their eyes Jeanne was a witch, and it was at least their cue\nto exhibit her as such. They might have put her to death when she\nfirst reached Rouen. Some persons, indeed, went so far as to\nadvise that she should be sewed up in a sack and thrown at once\ninto the Seine; but this was not what the authorities wanted. The\nwhole elaborate trial, and the extorted recantation, were devised\nfor the purpose of demonstrating her to be a witch, and thus\ndestroying her credit with the common people. That they intended\nafterwards to burn her cannot for an instant be doubted; that was\nthe only fit consummation for their evil work.",
        "Now when, at the end of the week after Pentecost, the bishops and\ninquisitors at Rouen learned, to their dismay, that their victim\nhad escaped, what were they to do? Confess that they had been\nfoiled, and create a panic in the army by the news that their\ndreaded enemy was at liberty? Or boldly carry out their purposes\nby a fictitious execution, trusting in the authority which\nofficial statements always carry, and shrewdly foreseeing that,\nafter her recantation, the disgraced Maid would no more venture\nto claim for herself the leadership of the French forces?\nClearly, the latter would have been the wiser course. We may\nassume, then, that, by the afternoon of the 28th, the story of\nthe relapse was promulgated, as a suitable preparation for what\nwas to come; and that on the 30th the poor creature who had been\nhastily chosen to figure as the condemned Maid was led out, with\nface closely veiled, to perish by a slow fire in the old\nmarket-place. Meanwhile the true Jeanne would have made her way,\ndoubtless, in what to her was the effectual disguise of a woman’s\napparel, to some obscure place of safety, outside of doubtful\nFrance and treacherous Burgundy, perhaps in Alsace or the Vosges.\nHere she would remain, until the final expulsion of the English\nand the conclusion of a treaty of peace in 1436 made it safe for\nher to show herself; when she would naturally return to Lorraine\nto seek her family.",
        "The comparative obscurity in which she must have remained for the\nrest of her life, otherwise quite inexplicable on any hypothesis\nof her survival, is in harmony with the above-given explanation.\nThe ingratitude of King Charles towards the heroine who had won\nhim his crown is the subject of common historical remark. M.\nWallon insists upon the circumstance that, after her capture at\nCompiegne, no attempts were made by the French Court to ransom\nher or to liberate her by a bold coup de main. And when, at\nRouen, she appealed in the name of the Church to the Pope to\ngrant her a fair trial, not a single letter was written by the\nArchbishop of Rheims, High Chancellor of France, to his\nsuffragan, the Bishop of Beauvais, demanding cognizance of the\nproceedings. Nor did the King make any appeal to the Pope, to\nprevent the consummation of the judicial murder. The Maid was\ndeliberately left to her fate. It is upon her enemies at court,\nLa Tremouille and Regnault de Chartres, that we must lay part of\nthe blame for this wicked negligence. But it is also probable\nthat the King, and especially his clerical advisers, were at\ntimes almost disposed to acquiesce in the theory of Jeanne’s\nwitchcraft. Admire her as they might, they could not help feeling\nthat in her whole behaviour there was something uncanny; and,\nafter having reaped the benefits of her assistance, they were\ncontent to let her shift for herself. This affords the clew to\nthe King’s inconsistencies. It may be thought sufficient to\nexplain the fact that Jeanne is said to have received public\ntestimonials at Orleans, while we have no reason to suppose that\nshe visited Paris. It may help to dispose of the objection that\nshe virtually disappears from history after the date of the\ntragedy at Rouen.",
        "Nevertheless, this last objection is a weighty one, and cannot\neasily be got rid of. It appears to me utterly incredible that,\nif Jeanne d’Arc had really survived, we should find no further\nmention of her than such as haply occurs in one or two\ntown-records and dilapidated account-books. If she was alive in\n1436, and corresponding with the King, some of her friends at\ncourt must have got an inkling of the true state of things. Why\ndid they not parade their knowledge, to the manifest discomfiture\nof La Tremouille and his company? Or why did not Pierre du Lis\ncause it to be proclaimed that the English were liars, his sister\nbeing safely housed in Metz?",
        "In the mere interests of historical criticism, we have said all\nthat we could in behalf of Mr. Delepierre’s hypothesis. But as to\nthe facts upon which it rests, we may remark, in the first place,\nthat the surname Arc or “Bow” was not uncommon in those days,\nwhile the Christian name Jeanne was and now is the very commonest\nof French names. There might have been a hundred Jeanne d’Arcs,\nall definable as pucelle or maid, just as we say “spinster”: we\neven read of one in the time of the Revolution. We have,\ntherefore, no doubt that Robert des Hermoises married a Jeanne\nd’Arc, who may also have been a maid of Orleans; but this does\nnot prove her to have been the historic Jeanne. Secondly, as to\nthe covering of the face, we may mention the fact, hitherto\nwithheld, that it was by no means an uncommon circumstance: the\nvictims of the Spanish Inquisition were usually led to the stake\nwith veiled faces. Thirdly, the phrase “jusques a son\nabsentement” is hopelessly ambiguous, and may as well refer to\nPierre du Lis himself as to his sister.",
        "These brief considerations seem to knock away all the main props\nof Mr. Delepierre’s hypothesis, save that furnished by the\napparent testimony of Jeanne’s brothers, given at second hand in\nthe Metz archives. And those who are familiar with the phenomena\nof mediaeval delusions will be unwilling to draw too hasty an\ninference from this alone. From the Emperor Nero to Don Sebastian\nof Portugal, there have been many instances of the supposed\nreappearance of persons generally believed to be dead. For my own\npart, therefore, I am by no means inclined to adopt the\nhypothesis of Jeanne’s survival, although I have endeavoured to\ngive it tangible shape and plausible consistency. But the fact\nthat so much can be said in behalf of a theory running counter\nnot only to universal tradition, but also to such a vast body of\ncontemporaneous testimony, should teach us to be circumspect in\nholding our opinions, and charitable in our treatment of those\nwho dissent from them. For those who can discover in the\nhistorian Renan and the critic Strauss nothing but the\nmalevolence of incredulity, the case of Jeanne d’Arc, duly\ncontemplated, may serve as a wholesome lesson.",
        "We have devoted so much space to this problem, by far the most\nconsiderable of those treated in Mr. Delepierre’s book, that we\nhave hardly room for any of the others. But a false legend\nconcerning Solomon de Caus, the supposed original inventor of the\nsteam-engine, is so instructive that we must give a brief account\nof it.",
        "In 1834 “there appeared in the Musee des Familles a letter from\nthe celebrated Marion Delorme, supposed to have been written on\nthe 3d February, 1641, to her lover Cinq-Mars.” In this letter it\nis stated that De Caus came four years ago [1637] from Normandy,\nto inform the King concerning a marvellous invention which he had\nmade, being nothing less than the application of steam to the\npropulsion of carriages. “The Cardinal [Richelieu] dismissed this\nfool without giving him a hearing.” But De Caus, nowise\ndiscouraged, followed close upon the autocrat’s heels wherever he\nwent, and so teased him, that the Cardinal, out of patience, sent\nhim off to a madhouse, where he passed the remainder of his days\nbehind a grated window, proclaiming his invention to the\npassengers in the street, and calling upon them to release him.\nMarion gives a graphic account of her visit, accompanied by the\nfamous Lord Worcester, to the asylum at Bicetre, where they saw\nDe Caus at his window; and Worcester, in whose mind the\nconception of the steam-engine was already taking shape, informed\nher that the raving prisoner was not a madman, but a genius. A\ngreat stir was made by this letter. The anecdote was copied into\nstandard works, and represented in engravings. Yet it was a\ncomplete hoax. De Caus was not only never confined in a madhouse,\nbut he was architect to Louis XIII. up to the time of his death,\nin 1630, just eleven years BEFORE Marion Delorme was said to have\nseen him at his grated window!",
        "“On tracing this hoax to its source,” says Mr. Delepierre, “we\nfind that M. Henri Berthoud, a literary man of some repute, and a\nconstant contributor to the Musee des Familles, confesses that\nthe letter attributed to Marion was in fact written by himself.\nThe editor of this journal had requested Gavarni to furnish him\nwith a drawing for a tale in which a madman was introduced\nlooking through the bars of his cell. The drawing was executed\nand engraved, but arrived too late; and the tale, which could not\nwait, appeared without the illustration. However, as the\nwood-engraving was effective, and, moreover, was paid for, the\neditor was unwilling that it should be useless. Berthoud was,\ntherefore, commissioned to look for a subject and to invent a\nstory to which the engraving might be applied. Strangely enough,\nthe world refused to believe in M. Berthoud’s confession, so\ngreat a hold had the anecdote taken on the public mind; and a\nParis newspaper went so far even as to declare that the original\nautograph of this letter was to be seen in a library in Normandy!\nM. Berthoud wrote again, denying its existence, and offered a\nmillion francs to any one who would produce the said letter.”",
        "From this we may learn two lessons, the first being that utterly\nbaseless but plausible stories may arise in queer ways. In the\nabove case, the most far-fetched hypothesis to account for the\norigin of the legend could hardly have been as apparently\nimprobable as the reality. Secondly, we may learn that if a myth\nonce gets into the popular mind, it is next to impossible to get\nit out again. In the Castle of Heidelberg there is a portrait of\nDe Caus, and a folio volume of his works, accompanied by a note,\nin which this letter of Marion Delorme is unsuspectingly cited as\ngenuine. And only three years ago, at a public banquet at\nLimoges, a well-known French Senator and man of letters made a\nspeech, in which he retailed the story of the madhouse for the\nedification of his hearers. Truly a popular error has as many\nlives as a cat; it comes walking in long after you have imagined\nit effectually strangled.",
        "In conclusion, we may remark that Mr. Delepierre does very scant\njustice to many of the interesting questions which he discusses.\nIt is to be regretted that he has not thought it worth while to\nargue his points more thoroughly, and that he has not been more\ncareful in making statements of fact. He sometimes makes strange\nblunders, the worst of which, perhaps, is contained in his\narticle on Petrarch and Laura. He thinks Laura was merely a\npoetical allegory, and such was the case, he goes on to say,\n\"with Dante himself, whose Beatrice was a child who died at nine\nyears of age.” Dante’s Beatrice died on the 9th of June, 1290, at\nthe age of twenty-four, having been the wife of Simone dei Bardi\nrather more than three years.",

        "[30] The Annals of Rural Bengal. By W. W. Hunter. Vol. I. The\nEthnical Frontier of Lower Bengal, with the Ancient\nPrincipalities of Beerbhoom and Bishenpore. Second Edition. New\nYork: Leypoldt and Holt. 1868. 8vo., pp. xvi., 475.",
        "No intelligent reader can advance fifty pages in this volume\nwithout becoming aware that he has got hold of a very remarkable\nbook. Mr. Hunter’s style, to begin with, is such as is written\nonly by men of large calibre and high culture. No words are\nwasted. The narrative flows calmly and powerfully along, like a\ngeometrical demonstration, omitting nothing which is significant,\nadmitting nothing which is irrelevant, glowing with all the\nwarmth of rich imagination and sympathetic genius, yet never\nallowing any overt manifestation of feeling, ever concealing the\nauthor’s personality beneath the unswerving exposition of the\nsubject-matter. That highest art, which conceals art, Mr. Hunter\nappears to have learned well. With him, the curtain is the\npicture.",
        "Such a style as this would suffice to make any book interesting,\nin spite of the remoteness of the subject. But the “Annals of\nRural Bengal” do not concern us so remotely as one might at first\nimagine. The phenomena of the moral and industrial growth or\nstagnation of a highly-endowed people must ever possess the\ninterest of fascination for those who take heed of the maxim that\n\"history is philosophy teaching by example.” National prosperity\ndepends upon circumstances sufficiently general to make the\nexperience of one country of great value to another, though\nignorant Bourbon dynasties and Rump Congresses refuse to learn\nthe lesson. It is of the intimate every-day life of rural Bengal\nthat Mr. Hunter treats. He does not, like old historians, try our\npatience with a bead-roll of names that have earned no just title\nto remembrance, or dazzle us with a bountiful display of\n\"barbaric pearls and gold,” or lead us in the gondolas of\nBuddhist kings down sacred rivers, amid “a summer fanned with\nspice\"; but he describes the labours and the sufferings, the\nmishaps and the good fortune, of thirty millions of people, who,\nhowever dusky may be their hue, tanned by the tropical suns of\nfifty centuries, are nevertheless members of the imperial Aryan\nrace, descended from the cool highlands eastward of the Caspian,\nwhere, long before the beginning of recorded history, their\nancestors and those of the Anglo-American were indistinguishably\nunited in the same primitive community.",
        "The narrative portion of the present volume is concerned mainly\nwith the social and economical disorganization wrought by the\ngreat famine of 1770, and with the attempts of the English\ngovernment to remedy the same. The remainder of the book is\noccupied with inquiries into the ethnic character of the\npopulation of Bengal, and particularly with an exposition of the\npeculiarities of the language, religion, customs, and\ninstitutions of the Santals, or hill-tribes of Beerbhoom. A few\nremarks on the first of these topics may not be uninteresting.",
        "Throughout the entire course of recorded European history, from\nthe remote times of which the Homeric poems preserve the dim\ntradition down to the present moment, there has occurred no\ncalamity at once so sudden and of such appalling magnitude as the\nfamine which in the spring and summer of 1770 nearly exterminated\nthe ancient civilization of Bengal. It presents that aspect of\npreternatural vastness which characterizes the continent of Asia\nand all that concerns it. The Black Death of the fourteenth\ncentury was, perhaps, the most fearful visitation which has ever\nafflicted the Western world. But in the concentrated misery which\nit occasioned the Bengal famine surpassed it, even as the\nHimalayas dwarf by comparison the highest peaks of Switzerland.\nIt is, moreover, the key to the history of Bengal during the next\nforty years; and as such, merits, from an economical point of\nview, closer attention than it has hitherto received.",
        "Lower Bengal gathers in three harvests each year; in the spring,\nin the early autumn, and in December, the last being the great\nrice-crop, the harvest on which the sustenance of the people\ndepends. Through the year 1769 there was great scarcity, owing to\nthe partial failure of the crops of 1768, but the spring rains\nappeared to promise relief, and in spite of the warning appeals\nof provincial officers, the government was slow to take alarm,\nand continued rigorously to enforce the land-tax. But in\nSeptember the rains suddenly ceased. Throughout the autumn there\nruled a parching drought; and the rice-fields, according to the\ndescription of a native superintendent of Bishenpore, “became\nlike fields of dried straw.” Nevertheless, the government at\nCalcutta made—with one lamentable exception, hereafter to be\nnoticed—no legislative attempt to meet the consequences of this\ndangerous condition of things. The administration of local\naffairs was still, at that date, intrusted to native officials.\nThe whole internal regulation was in the hands of the famous\nMuhamad Reza Ehan. Hindu or Mussulman assessors pried into every\nbarn and shrewdly estimated the probable dimensions of the crops\non every field; and the courts, as well as the police, were still\nin native hands. “These men,” says our author, “knew the country,\nits capabilities, its average yield, and its average\nrequirements, with an accuracy that the most painstaking English\nofficial can seldom hope to attain to. They had a strong interest\nin representing things to be worse than they were; for the more\nintense the scarcity, the greater the merit in collecting the\nland-tax. Every consultation is filled with their apprehensions\nand highly-coloured accounts of the public distress; but it does\nnot appear that the conviction entered the minds of the Council\nduring the previous winter months, that the question was not so\nmuch one of revenue as of depopulation.” In fact, the local\nofficers had cried “Wolf!” too often. Government was slow to\nbelieve them, and announced that nothing better could be expected\nthan the adoption of a generous policy toward those landholders\nwhom the loss of harvest had rendered unable to pay their\nland-tax. But very few indulgences were granted, and the tax was\nnot diminished, but on the contrary was, in the month of April,\n1770, increased by ten per cent for the following year. The\ncharacter of the Bengali people must also be taken into the\naccount in explaining this strange action on the part of the\ngovernment.",
        "“From the first appearance of Lower Bengal in history, its\ninhabitants have been reticent, self-contained, distrustful of\nforeign observation, in a degree without parallel among other\nequally civilized nations. The cause of this taciturnity will\nafterwards be clearly explained; but no one who is acquainted\neither with the past experiences or the present condition of the\npeople can be ignorant of its results. Local officials may write\nalarming reports, but their apprehensions seem to be contradicted\nby the apparent quiet that prevails. Outward, palpable proofs of\nsuffering are often wholly wanting; and even when, as in 1770,\nsuch proofs abound, there is generally no lack of evidence on the\nother side. The Bengali bears existence with a composure that\nneither accident nor chance can ruffle. He becomes silently rich\nor uncomplainingly poor. The emotional part of his nature is in\nstrict subjection, his resentment enduring but unspoken, his\ngratitude of the sort that silently descends from generation to\ngeneration. The. passion for privacy reaches its climax in the\ndomestic relations. An outer apartment, in even the humblest\nhouseholds, is set apart for strangers and the transaction of\nbusiness, but everything behind it is a mystery. The most\nintimate friend does not venture to make those commonplace kindly\ninquiries about a neighbour’s wife or daughter which European\ncourtesy demands from mere acquaintances. This family privacy is\nmaintained at any price. During the famine of 1866 it was found\nimpossible to render public charity available to the female\nmembers of the respectable classes, and many a rural household\nstarved slowly to death without uttering a complaint or making a\nsign.",
        "“All through the stifling summer of 1770 the people went on\ndying. The husbandmen sold their cattle; they sold their\nimplements of agriculture; they devoured their seed-grain; they\nsold their sons and daughters, till at length no buyer of\nchildren could be found; they ate the leaves of trees and the\ngrass of the field; and in June, 1770, the Resident at the Durbar\naffirmed that the living were feeding on the dead. Day and night\na torrent of famished and disease-stricken wretches poured into\nthe great cities. At an early period of the year pestilence had\nbroken out. In March we find small-pox at Moorshedabad, where it\nglided through the vice-regal mutes, and cut off the Prince Syfut\nin his palace. The streets were blocked up with promiscuous heaps\nof the dying and dead. Interment could not do its work quick\nenough; even the dogs and jackals, the public scavengers of the\nEast, became unable to accomplish their revolting work, and the\nmultitude of mangled and festering corpses at length threatened\nthe existence of the citizens..... In 1770, the rainy season\nbrought relief, and before the end of September the province\nreaped an abundant harvest. But the relief came too late to avert\ndepopulation. Starving and shelterless crowds crawled\ndespairingly from one deserted village to another in a vain\nsearch for food, or a resting-place in which to hide themselves\nfrom the rain. The epidemics incident to the season were thus\nspread over the whole country; and, until the close of the year,\ndisease continued so prevalent as to form a subject of\ncommunication from the government in Bengal to the Court of\nDirectors. Millions of famished wretches died in the struggle to\nlive through the few intervening weeks that separated them from\nthe harvest, their last gaze being probably fixed on the\ndensely-covered fields that would ripen only a little too late\nfor them..... Three months later, another bountiful harvest, the\ngreat rice-crop of the year, was gathered in. Abundance returned\nto Bengal as suddenly as famine had swooped down upon it, and in\nreading some of the manuscript records of December it is\ndifficult to realize that the scenes of the preceding ten months\nhave not been hideous phantasmagoria or a long, troubled dream.\nOn Christmas eve, the Council in Calcutta wrote home to the Court\nof Directors that the scarcity had entirely ceased, and,\nincredible as it may seem, that unusual plenty had returned.....\nSo generous had been the harvest that the government proposed at\nonce to lay in its military stores for the ensuing year, and\nexpected to obtain them at a very cheap rate.”",
        "Such sudden transitions from the depths of misery to the most\nexuberant plenty are by no means rare in the history of Asia,\nwhere the various centres of civilization are, in an economical\nsense, so isolated from each other that the welfare of the\npopulation is nearly always absolutely dependent on the\nirregular: and apparently capricious bounty of nature. For the\nthree years following the dreadful misery above described,\nharvests of unprecedented abundance were gathered in. Yet how\ninadequate they were to repair the fearful damage wrought by six\nmonths of starvation, the history of the next quarter of a\ncentury too plainly reveals. “Plenty had indeed returned,” says\nour annalist, “but it had returned to a silent and deserted\nprovince.” The extent of the depopulation is to our Western\nimaginations almost incredible. During those six months of\nhorror, more than TEN MILLIONS of people had perished! It was as\nif the entire population of our three or four largest\nStates—man, woman, and child—were to be utterly swept away\nbetween now and next August, leaving the region between the\nHudson and Lake Michigan as quiet and deathlike as the buried\nstreets of Pompeii. Yet the estimate is based upon most accurate\nand trustworthy official returns; and Mr. Hunter may well say\nthat “it represents an aggregate of individual suffering which no\nEuropean nation has been called upon to contemplate within\nhistoric times.”",
        "This unparalleled calamity struck down impartially the rich and\nthe poor. The old, aristocratic families of Lower Bengal were\nirretrievably ruined. The Rajah of Burdwan, whose possessions\nwere so vast that, travel as far as he would, he always slept\nunder a roof of his own and within his own jurisdiction, died in\nsuch indigence that his son had to melt down the family plate and\nbeg a loan from the government in order to discharge his father’s\nfuneral expenses. And our author gives other similar instances.\nThe wealthy natives who were appointed to assess and collect the\ninternal revenue, being unable to raise the sums required by the\ngovernment, were in many cases imprisoned, or their estates were\nconfiscated and re-let in order to discharge the debt.",
        "For fifteen years the depopulation went on increasing. The\nchildren in a community, requiring most nourishment to sustain\ntheir activity, are those who soonest succumb to famine. “Until\n1785,” says our author, “the old died off without there being any\nrising generation to step into their places.” From lack of\ncultivators, one third of the surface of Bengal fell out of\ntillage and became waste land. The landed proprietors began each\n\"to entice away the tenants of his neighbour, by offering\nprotection against judicial proceedings, and farms at very low\nrents.” The disputes and deadly feuds which arose from this\npractice were, perhaps, the least fatal of the evil results which\nflowed from it. For the competition went on until, the tenants\nobtaining their holdings at half-rates, the resident\ncultivators—who had once been the wealthiest farmers in the\ncountry—were no longer able to complete on such terms. They\nbegan to sell, lease, or desert their property, migrating to less\nafflicted regions, or flying to the hills on the frontier to\nadopt a savage life. But, in a climate like that of Northeastern\nIndia, it takes but little time to transform a tract of untilled\nland into formidable wilderness. When the functions of society\nare impeded, nature is swift to assert its claims. And\naccordingly, in 1789, “Lord Cornwallis after three years’\nvigilant inquiry, pronounced one third of the company’s\nterritories in Bengal to be a jungle, inhabited only by wild\nbeasts.”",
        "On the Western frontier of Beerbhoom the state of affairs was,\nperhaps, most calamitous. In 1776, four acres out of every seven\nremained untilled. Though in earlier times this district had been\na favourite highway for armies, by the year 1780 it had become an\nalmost impassable jungle. A small company of Sepoys, which in\nthat year by heroic exertions forced its way through, was obliged\nto traverse 120 miles of trackless forest, swarming with tigers\nand black shaggy bears. In 1789 this jungle “continued so dense\nas to shut off all communication between the two most important\ntowns, and to cause the mails to be carried by a circuit of fifty\nmiles through another district.”",
        "Such a state of things it is difficult for us to realize; but the\nmonotonous tale of disaster and suffering is not yet complete.\nBeerbhoom was, to all intents and purposes, given over to tigers.\n\"A belt of jungle, filled with wild beasts, formed round each\nvillage.” At nightfall the hungry animals made their dreaded\nincursions carrying away cattle, and even women and children, and\ndevouring them. “The official records frequently speak of the\nmail-bag being carried off by wild beasts.” So great was the\ndamage done by these depredations, that “the company offered a\nreward for each tiger’s head, sufficient to maintain a peasant’s\nfamily in comfort for three months; an item of expenditure it\ndeemed so necessary, that, when under extraordinary pressure it\nhad to suspend all payments, the tiger-money and diet allowance\nfor prisoners were the sole exceptions to the rule.” Still more\nformidable foes were found in the herds of wild elephants, which\ncame trooping along in the rear of the devastation caused by the\nfamine. In the course of a few years fifty-six villages were\nreported as destroyed by elephants, and as having lapsed into\njungle in consequence; “and an official return states that forty\nmarket-towns throughout the district had been deserted from the\nsame cause. In many parts of the country the peasantry did not\ndare to sleep in their houses, lest they should be buried beneath\nthem during the night.” These terrible beasts continued to infest\nthe province as late as 1810.",
        "But society during these dark days had even worse enemies than\ntigers and elephants. The barbarous highlanders, of a lower type\nof mankind, nourishing for forty centuries a hatred of their\nHindu supplanters, like that which the Apache bears against the\nwhite frontiersman, seized the occasion to renew their inroads\nupon the lowland country. Year by year they descended from their\nmountain fastnesses, plundering and burning. Many noble Hindu\nfamilies, ousted by the tax-collectors from their estates, began\nto seek subsistence from robbery. Others, consulting their\nselfish interests amid the general distress, “found it more\nprofitable to shelter banditti on their estates, levying\nblackmail from the surrounding villages as the price of immunity\nfrom depredation, and sharing in the plunder of such as would not\ncome to terms. Their country houses were robber strongholds, and\nthe early English administrators of Bengal have left it on record\nthat a gang-robbery never occurred without a landed proprietor\nbeing at the bottom of it.” The peasants were not slow to follow\nsuit, and those who were robbed of their winter’s store had no\nalternative left but to become robbers themselves. The thieveries\nof the Fakeers, or religious mendicants, and the bold, though\nstealthy attacks of Thugs and Dacoits—members of Masonic\nbrotherhoods, which at all times have lived by robbery and\nassassination—added to the general turmoil. In the cold weather\nof 1772 the province was ravaged far and wide by bands of armed\nfreebooters, fifty thousand strong; and to such a pass did things\narrive that the regular forces sent by Warren Hastings to\npreserve order were twice disastrously routed; while, in Mr.\nHunter’s graphic language, “villages high up the Ganges lived by\nhousebreaking in Calcutta.” In English mansions “it was the\ninvariable practice for the porter to shut the outer door at the\ncommencement of each meal, and not to open it till the butler\nbrought him word that the plate was safely locked up.” And for a\nlong time nearly all traffic ceased upon the imperial roads.",
        "This state of things, which amounted to chronic civil war,\ninduced Lord Cornwallis in 1788 to place the province under the\ndirect military control of an English officer. The administration\nof Mr. Keating—the first hardy gentleman to whom this arduous\noffice was assigned—is minutely described by our author. For our\npresent purpose it is enough to note that two years of severe\ncampaigning, attended and followed by relentless punishment of\nall transgressors, was required to put an end to the disorders.",
        "Such was the appalling misery, throughout a community of thirty\nmillion persons, occasioned by the failure of the winter\nrice-crop in 1769. In abridging Mr. Hunter’s account we have\nadhered as closely to our original as possible, but he who would\nobtain adequate knowledge of this tale of woe must seek it in the\never memorable description of the historian himself. The first\nquestion which naturally occurs to the reader—though, as Mr.\nHunter observes, it would have been one of the last to occur to\nthe Oriental mind—is, Who was to blame? To what culpable\nnegligence was it due that such a dire calamity was not foreseen,\nand at least partially warded off? We shall find reason to\nbelieve that it could not have been adequately foreseen, and that\nno legislative measures could in that state of society have\nentirely prevented it. Yet it will appear that the government,\nwith the best of intentions, did all in its power to make matters\nworse; and that to its blundering ignorance the distress which\nfollowed is largely due.",
        "The first duty incumbent upon the government in a case like that\nof the failure of the winter rice-crop of 1769, was to do away\nwith all hindrance to the importation of food into the province.\nOne chief cause of the far-reaching distress wrought by great\nAsiatic famines has been the almost complete commercial isolation\nof Asiatic communities. In the Middle Ages the European\ncommunities were also, though to a far less extent, isolated from\neach other, and in those days periods of famine were\ncomparatively frequent and severe. And one of the chief causes\nwhich now render the occurrence of a famine on a great scale\nalmost impossible in any part of the civilized world is the\nincreased commercial solidarity of civilized nations. Increased\nfacility of distribution has operated no less effectively than\nimproved methods of production.",
        "Now, in 1770 the province of Lower Bengal was in a state of\nalmost complete commercial isolation from other communities.\nImportation of food on an adequate scale was hardly possible. “A\nsingle fact speaks volumes as to the isolation of each district.\nAn abundant harvest, we are repeatedly told, was as disastrous to\nthe revenues as a bad one; for, when a large quantity of grain\nhad to be carried to market, the cost of carriage swallowed up\nthe price obtained. Indeed, even if the means of\nintercommunication and transport had rendered importation\npracticable, the province had at that time no money to give in\nexchange for food. Not only had its various divisions a separate\ncurrency which would pass nowhere else except at a ruinous\nexchange, but in that unfortunate year Bengal seems to have been\nutterly drained of its specie..... The absence of the means of\nimportation was the more to be deplored, as the neighbouring\ndistricts could easily have supplied grain. In the southeast a\nfair harvest had been reaped, except, in circumscribed spots; and\nwe are assured that, during the famine, this part of Bengal was\nenabled to export without having to complain of any deficiency in\nconsequence..... INDEED, NO MATTER HOW LOCAL A FAMINE MIGHT BE IN\nTHE LAST CENTURY, THE EFFECTS WERE EQUALLY DISASTROUS. Sylhet, a\ndistrict in the northeast of Bengal, had reaped unusually\nplentiful harvests in 1780 and 1781, but the next crop was\ndestroyed by a local inundation, and, notwithstanding the\nfacilities for importation afforded by water-carriage, one third\nof the people died.”",
        "Here we have a vivid representation of the economic condition of\na society which, however highly civilized in many important\nrespects, still retained, at the epoch treated of, its aboriginal\ntype of organization. Here we see each community brought face to\nface with the impossible task of supplying, unaided, the\ndeficiencies of nature. We see one petty district a prey to the\nmost frightful destitution, even while profuse plenty reigns in\nthe districts round about it. We find an almost complete absence\nof the commercial machinery which, by enabling the starving\nregion to be fed out of the surplus of more favoured localities,\nhas in the most advanced countries rendered a great famine\npractically impossible.",
        "Now this state of things the government of 1770 was indeed\npowerless to remedy. Legislative power and wisdom could not\nanticipate the invention of railroads; nor could it introduce\nthroughout the length and breadth of Bengal a system of coaches,\ncanals, and caravans; nor could it all at once do away with the\ntime-honoured brigandage, which increased the cost of transport\nby decreasing the security of it; nor could it in a trice remove\nthe curse of a heterogeneous coinage. None, save those\nuninstructed agitators who believe that governments can make\nwater run up-hill, would be disposed to find fault with the\nauthorities in Bengal for failing to cope with these\ndifficulties. But what we are to blame them for—though it was an\nerror of the judgment and not of the intentions—is their\nmischievous interference with the natural course of trade, by\nwhich, instead of helping matters, they but added another to the\nmany powerful causes which were conspiring to bring about the\neconomic ruin of Bengal. We refer to the act which in 1770\nprohibited under penalties all speculation in rice.",
        "This disastrous piece of legislation was due to the universal\nprevalence of a prejudice from which so-called enlightened\ncommunities are not yet wholly free. It is even now customary to\nheap abuse upon those persons who in a season of scarcity, when\nprices are rapidly rising, buy up the “necessaries of life,\"\nthereby still increasing for a time the cost of living. Such\npersons are commonly assailed with specious generalities to the\neffect that they are enemies of society. People whose only ideas\nare “moral ideas” regard them as heartless sharpers who fatten\nupon the misery of their fellow-creatures. And it is sometimes\nhinted that such “practices” ought to be stopped by legislation.",
        "Now, so far is this prejudice, which is a very old one, from\nbeing justified by facts, that, instead of being an evil,\nspeculation in breadstuffs and other necessaries is one of the\nchief agencies by which in modern times and civilized countries a\nreal famine is rendered almost impossible. This natural monopoly\noperates in two ways. In the first place, by raising prices, it\nchecks consumption, putting every one on shorter allowance until\nthe season of scarcity is over, and thus prevents the scarcity\nfrom growing into famine. In the second place, by raising prices,\nit stimulates importation from those localities where abundance\nreigns and prices are low. It thus in the long run does much to\nequalize the pressure of a time of dearth and diminish those\nextreme oscillations of prices which interfere with the even,\nhealthy course of trade. A government which, in a season of high\nprices, does anything to check such speculation, acts about as\nsagely as the skipper of a wrecked vessel who should refuse to\nput his crew upon half rations.",
        "The turning-point of the great Dutch Revolution, so far as it\nconcerned the provinces which now constitute Belgium, was the\nfamous siege and capture of Antwerp by Alexander Farnese, Duke of\nParma. The siege was a long one, and the resistance obstinate,\nand the city would probably not have been captured if famine had\nnot come to the assistance of the besiegers. It is interesting,\ntherefore, to inquire what steps the civic authorities had taken\nto prevent such a calamity. They knew that the struggle before\nthem was likely to be the life-and-death struggle of the Southern\nNetherlands; they knew that there was risk of their being\nsurrounded so that relief from without would be impossible; they\nknew that their assailant was one of the most astute and\nunconquerable of men, by far the greatest general of the\nsixteenth century. Therefore they proceeded to do just what our\nRepublican Congress, under such circumstances, would probably\nhave done, and just what the New York Tribune, if it had existed\nin those days, would have advised them to do. Finding that sundry\nspeculators were accumulating and hoarding up provisions in\nanticipation of a season of high prices, they hastily decided,\nfirst of all to put a stop to such “selfish iniquity.” In their\neyes the great thing to be done was to make things cheap. They\ntherefore affixed a very low maximum price to everything which\ncould be eaten, and prescribed severe penalties for all who\nshould attempt to take more than the sum by law decreed. If a\nbaker refused to sell his bread for a price which would have been\nadequate only in a time of great plenty, his shop was to be\nbroken open, and his loaves distributed among the populace. The\nconsequences of this idiotic policy were twofold.",
        "In the first place, the enforced lowness of prices prevented any\nbreadstuffs or other provisions from being brought into the city.\nIt was a long time before Farnese succeeded in so blockading the\nScheldt as to prevent ships laden with eatables from coming in\nbelow. Corn and preserved meats might have been hurried by\nthousands of tons into the beleaguered city. Friendly Dutch\nvessels, freighted with abundance, were waiting at the mouth of\nthe river. But all to no purpose. No merchant would expose his\nvaluable ship, with its cargo, to the risk of being sunk by\nFarnese’s batteries, merely for the sake of finding a market no\nbetter than a hundred others which could be entered without\nincurring danger. No doubt if the merchants of Holland had\nfollowed out the maxim Vivre pour autrui, they would have braved\nruin and destruction rather than behold their neighbours of\nAntwerp enslaved. No doubt if they could have risen to a broad\nphilosophic view of the future interests of the Netherlands, they\nwould have seen that Antwerp must be saved, no matter if some of\nthem were to lose money by it. But men do not yet sacrifice\nthemselves for their fellows, nor do they as a rule look far\nbeyond the present moment and its emergencies. And the business\nof government is to legislate for men as they are, not as it is\nsupposed they ought to be. If provisions had brought a high price\nin Antwerp, they would have been carried thither. As it was, the\ncity, by its own stupidity, blockaded itself far more effectually\nthan Farnese could have done it.",
        "In the second place, the enforced lowness of prices prevented any\ngeneral retrenchment on the part of the citizens. Nobody felt it\nnecessary to economize. Every one bought as much bread, and ate\nit as freely, as if the government by insuring its cheapness had\ninsured its abundance. So the city lived in high spirits and in\ngleeful defiance of its besiegers, until all at once provisions\ngave out, and the government had to step in again to palliate the\ndistress which it had wrought. It constituted itself\nquartermaster-general to the community, and doled out stinted\nrations alike to rich and poor, with that stern democratic\nimpartiality peculiar to times of mortal peril. But this served\nonly, like most artificial palliatives, to lengthen out the\nmisery. At the time of the surrender, not a loaf of bread could\nbe obtained for love or money.",
        "In this way a bungling act of legislation helped to decide for\nthe worse a campaign which involved the territorial integrity and\nfuture welfare of what might have become a great nation\nperforming a valuable function in the system of European\ncommunities.",
        "The striking character of this instructive example must be our\nexcuse for presenting it at such length. At the beginning of the\nfamine in Bengal the authorities legislated in very much the same\nspirit as the burghers who had to defend Antwerp against Parma.",
        "“By interdicting what it was pleased to term the monopoly of\ngrain, it prevented prices from rising at once to their natural\nrates. The Province had a certain amount of food in it, and this\nfood had to last about nine months. Private enterprise if left to\nitself would have stored up the general supply at the harvest,\nwith a view to realizing a larger profit at a later period in the\nscarcity. Prices would in consequence have immediately risen,\ncompelling the population to reduce their consumption from the\nvery beginning of the dearth. The general stock would thus have\nbeen husbanded, and the pressure equally spread over the whole\nnine months, instead of being concentrated upon the last six. The\nprice of grain, in place of promptly rising to three half-pence a\npound as in 1865-66, continued at three farthings during the\nearlier months of the famine. During the latter ones it advanced\nto twopence, and in certain localities reached fourpence.”",
        "The course taken by the great famine of 1866 well illustrates the\nabove views. This famine, also, was caused by the total failure\nof the December rice-crop, and it was brought to a close by an\nabundant harvest in the succeeding year.",
        "“Even as regards the maximum price reached, the analogy holds\ngood, in each case rice having risen in general to nearly\ntwopence, and in particular places to fourpence, a pound; and in\neach the quoted rates being for a brief period in several\nisolated localities merely nominal, no food existing in the\nmarket, and money altogether losing its interchangeable value. In\nboth the people endured silently to the end, with a fortitude\nthat casual observers of a different temperament and widely\ndissimilar race may easily mistake for apathy, but which those\nwho lived among the sufferers are unable to distinguish from\nqualities that generally pass under a more honourable name.\nDuring 1866, when the famine was severest, I superintended public\ninstruction throughout the southwestern division of Lower Bengal,\nincluding Orissa. The subordinate native officers, about eight\nhundred in number, behaved with a steadiness, and when called\nupon, with a self-abnegation, beyond praise. Many of them ruined\ntheir health. The touching scenes of self-sacrifice and humble\nheroism which I witnessed among the poor villagers on my tours of\ninspection will remain in my memory till my latest day.”",
        "But to meet the famine of 1866 Bengal was equipped with railroads\nand canals, and better than all, with an intelligent government.\nFar from trying to check speculation, as in 1770, the government\ndid all in its power to stimulate it. In the earlier famine one\ncould hardly engage in the grain trade without becoming amenable\nto the law. “In 1866 respectable men in vast numbers went into\nthe trade; for government, by publishing weekly returns of the\nrates in every district, rendered the traffic both easy and safe.\nEvery one knew where to buy grain cheapest, and where to sell it\ndearest, and food was accordingly brought from the districts that\ncould best spare it, and carried to those which most urgently\nneeded it. Not only were prices equalized so far as possible\nthroughout the stricken parts, but the publicity given to the\nhigh rates in Lower Bengal induced large shipments from the upper\nprovinces, and the chief seat of the trade became unable to\nafford accommodation for landing the vast stores of grain brought\ndown the river. Rice poured into the affected districts from all\nparts,—railways, canals, and roads vigorously doing their duty.”",
        "The result of this wise policy was that scarcity was heightened\ninto famine only in one remote corner of Bengal. Orissa was\ncommercially isolated in 1866, as the whole country had been in\n1770. “As far back as the records extend, Orissa has produced\nmore grain than it can use. It is an exporting, not an importing\nprovince, sending away its surplus grain by sea, and neither\nrequiring nor seeking any communication with Lower Bengal by\nland.” Long after the rest of the province had begun to prepare\nfor a year of famine, Orissa kept on exporting. In March, when\nthe alarm was first raised, the southwest monsoon had set in,\nrendering the harbours inaccessible. Thus the district was\nisolated. It was no longer possible to apply the wholesome policy\nwhich was operating throughout the rest of the country. The\ndoomed population of Orissa, like passengers in a ship without\nprovisions, were called upon to suffer the extremities of famine;\nand in the course of the spring and summer of 1866, some seven\nhundred thousand people perished.",

        "Tandem fit surculus arbor: the twig which Mr. Motley in his\nearlier volumes has described as slowly putting forth its leaves\nand rootless, while painfully struggling for existence in a\nhostile soil, has at last grown into a mighty tree of liberty,\ndrawing sustenance from all lands, and protecting all civilized\npeoples with its pleasant shade. We congratulate Mr. Motley upon\nthe successful completion of the second portion of his great\nwork; and we think that the Netherlanders of our time have reason\nto be grateful to the writer who has so faithfully and eloquently\ntold the story of their country’s fearful struggle against civil\nand ecclesiastical tyranny, and its manifold contributions to the\nadvancement of European civilization.",
        "Mr. Motley has been fortunate in his selection of a subject upon\nwhich to write. Probably no century of modern times lends itself\nto the purposes of the descriptive historian so well as the\nsixteenth. While on the one hand the problems which it presents\nare sufficiently near for us to understand them without too great\nan effort of the imagination, on the other hand they are\nsufficiently remote for us to study them without passionate and\nwarping prejudice. The contest between Catholicism and the\nreformed religion—between ecclesiastical autocracy and the right\nof private investigation—has become a thing of the past, and\nconstitutes a closed chapter in human history. The epoch which\nbegins where Mr. Motley’s history is designed to close—at the\npeace of Westphalia—is far more complicated. Since the middle of\nthe seventeenth century a double movement has been going on in\nreligion and philosophy, society and politics,—a movement of\ndestruction typified by Voltaire and Rousseau, and a constructive\nmovement represented by Diderot and Lessing. We are still living\nin the midst of this great epoch: the questions which it presents\nare liable to disturb our prejudices as well as to stimulate our\nreason; the results to which it must sooner or later attain can\nnow be only partially foreseen; and even its present tendencies\nare generally misunderstood, and in many quarters wholly ignored.\nWith the sixteenth century, as we have said, the case is far\ndifferent. The historical problem is far less complex. The issues\nat stake are comparatively simple, and the historian has before\nhim a straightforward story.",
        "From the dramatic, or rather from the epic, point of view, the\nsixteenth century is pre-eminent. The essentially transitional\ncharacter of modern history since the breaking up of the papal\nand feudal systems is at no period more distinctly marked. In\ntraversing the sixteenth century we realize that we have fairly\ngot out of one state of things and into another. At the outset,\nevents like the challenge of Barletta may make us doubt whether\nwe have yet quite left behind the Middle Ages. The belief in the\ncentral position of the earth is still universal, and the belief\nin its rotundity not yet, until the voyage of Magellan, generally\naccepted. We find England—owing partly to the introduction of\ngunpowder and the consequent disuse of archery, partly to the\nresults of the recent integration of France under Louis\nXI.—fallen back from the high relative position which it had\noccupied under the rule of the Plantagenets; and its policy still\ndirected in accordance with reminiscences of Agincourt, and\ngarnet, and Burgundian alliances. We find France just beginning\nher ill-fated career of intervention in the affairs of Italy; and\nSpain, with her Moors finally vanquished and a new world beyond\nthe ocean just added to her domain, rapidly developing into the\ngreatest empire which had been seen since the days of the first\nCaesars. But at the close of the century we find feudal life in\ncastles changed into modern life in towns; chivalric defiances\nexchanged for over-subtle diplomacy; Maurices instead of Bayards;\na Henry IV. instead of a Gaston de Foix. We find the old theory\nof man’s central position in the universe—the foundation of the\ndoctrine of final causes and of the whole theological method of\ninterpreting nature—finally overthrown by Copernicus. Instead of\nthe circumnavigability of the earth, the discovery of a Northwest\npassage—as instanced by the heroic voyage of Barendz, so nobly\ndescribed by Mr. Motley—is now the chief geographical problem.\nEast India Companies, in place of petty guilds of weavers and\nbakers, bear witness to the vast commercial progress. We find\nEngland, fresh from her stupendous victory over the whole power\nof Spain, again in the front rank of nations; France, under the\nmost astute of modern sovereigns, taking her place for a time as\nthe political leader of the civilized world; Spain, with her evil\nschemes baffled in every quarter, sinking into that terrible\ndeath-like lethargy, from which she has hardly yet awakened, and\nwhich must needs call forth our pity, though it is but the\ndeserved retribution for her past behaviour. While the little\nrealm of the Netherlands, filched and cozened from the\nunfortunate Jacqueline by the “good” Duke of Burgundy, carried\nover to Austria as the marriage-portion of Lady Mary, sent down\nto Spain as the personal inheritance of the “prudent” Philip, and\nby him intolerably tormented with an Inquisition, a\nBlood-Council, and a Duke of Alva, has after a forty years’ war\nof independence taken its position for a time as the greatest of\ncommercial nations, with the most formidable navy and one of the\nbest disciplined armies yet seen upon the earth.",
        "But the central phenomenon of the sixteenth century is the\nculmination of the Protestant movement in its decisive\nproclamation by Luther. For nearly three hundred years already\nthe power of the Church had been declining, and its function as a\ncivilizing agency had been growing more and more obsolete. The\nfirst great blow at its supremacy had been directed with partial\nsuccess in the thirteenth century by the Emperor Frederick II.\nCoincident with this attack from without, we find a reformation\nbegun within, as exemplified in the Dominican and Franciscan\nmovements. The second great blow was aimed by Philip IV. of\nFrance, and this time it struck with terrible force. The removal\nof the Papacy to Avignon, in 1305, was the virtual though\nunrecognized abdication of its beneficent supremacy. Bereft of\nits dignity and independence, from that time forth it ceased to\nbe the defender of national unity against baronial anarchy, of\npopular rights against monarchical usurpation, and became a\nformidable instrument of despotism and oppression. Through the\nvicissitudes of the great schism in the fourteenth century, and\nthe refractory councils in the fifteenth, its position became\nrapidly more and more retrograde and demoralized. And when, in\n1530, it joined its forces with those of Charles V., in crushing\nthe liberties of the worthiest of mediaeval republics, it became\nevident that the cause of freedom and progress must henceforth be\nintrusted to some more faithful champion. The revolt of Northern\nEurope, led by Luther and Henry VIII. was but the articulate\nannouncement of this altered state of affairs. So long as the\nRoman Church had been felt to be the enemy of tyrannical monarchs\nand the steadfast friend of the people, its encroachments, as\nrepresented by men like Dunstan and Becket, were regarded with\npopular favour. The strength of the Church lay ever in its\ndemocratic instincts; and when these were found to have abandoned\nit, the indignant protest of Luther sufficed to tear away half of\nEurope from its allegiance.",
        "By the end of the sixteenth century, we find the territorial\nstruggle between the Church and the reformed religion\nsubstantially decided. Protestantism and Catholicism occupied\nthen the same respective areas which they now occupy. Since 1600\nthere has been no instance of a nation passing from one form of\nworship to the other; and in all probability there never will be.\nSince the wholesale dissolution of religious beliefs wrought in\nthe last century, the whole issue between Romanism and\nProtestantism, regarded as dogmatic systems, is practically dead.\nM. Renan is giving expression to an almost self-evident truth,\nwhen he says that religious development is no longer to proceed\nby way of sectarian proselytism, but by way of harmonious\ninternal development. The contest is no longer between one\ntheology and another, but it is between the theological and the\nscientific methods of interpreting natural phenomena. The\nsixteenth century has to us therefore the interest belonging to a\nrounded and completed tale. It contains within itself\nsubstantially the entire history of the final stage of the\ntheological reformation.",
        "This great period falls naturally into two divisions, the first\ncorresponding very nearly with the reigns of Charles V. and Henry\nVIII., and the second with the age of Philip II. and Elizabeth.\nThe first of these periods was filled with the skirmishes which\nwere to open the great battle of the Reformation. At first the\nstrength and extent of the new revolution were not altogether\napparent. While the Inquisition was vigorously crushing out the\nfirst symptoms of disaffection in Spain, it at one time seemed as\nif the Reformers were about to gain the whole of the Empire,\nbesides acquiring an excellent foothold in France. Again, while\nEngland was wavering between the old and the new faith, the last\nhopes of the Reform in Germany seemed likely to be destroyed by\nthe military genius of Charles. But in Maurice, the red-bearded\nhero of Saxony, Charles found more than his match. The picture of\nthe rapid and desperate march of Maurice upon Innspruck, and of\nthe great Emperor flying for his life at the very hour of his\nimagined triumph, has still for us an intenser interest than\nalmost any other scene of that age; for it was the event which\nproved that Protestantism was not a mere local insurrection which\na monarch like Charles could easily put down, but a gigantic\nrevolution against which all the powers in the world might well\nstrive in vain.",
        "With the abdication of Charles in 1556 the new period may be said\nto begin, and it is here that Mr. Motley’s history commences.\nEvents crowded thick and fast. In 1556 Philip II., a prince bred\nand educated for the distinct purpose of suppressing heresy,\nsucceeded to the rule of the most powerful empire which had been\nseen since the days of the Antonines. In the previous year a new\nera had begun at the court of Rome. The old race of pagan\npontiffs, the Borgias, the Farneses, and the Medicis, had come to\nan end, and the papal throne was occupied by the puritanical\nCaraffa, as violent a fanatic as Robespierre, and a foe of\nfreedom as uncompromising as Philip II. himself. Under his\nauspices took place the great reform in the Church signalized by\nthe rise of the Jesuits, as the reform in the thirteenth century\nhad been attended by the rise of the Cordeliers and Dominicans.\nHis name should not be forgotten, for it is mainly owing to the\npolicy inaugurated by him that Catholicism was enabled to hold\nits ground as well as it did. In 1557 the next year, the strength\nof France was broken at St. Quentin, and Spain was left with her\nhands free to deal with the Protestant powers. In 1558, by the\naccession of Elizabeth, England became committed to the cause of\nReform. In 1559 the stormy administration of Margaret began in\nthe Netherlands. In 1560 the Scotch nobles achieved the\ndestruction of Catholicism in North Britain. By this time every\nnation except France, had taken sides in the conflict which was\nto last, with hardly any cessation, during two generations.",
        "Mr. Motley, therefore, in describing the rise and progress of the\nunited republic of the Netherlands, is writing not Dutch but\nEuropean history. On his pages France, Spain, and England make\nalmost as large a figure as Holland itself. He is writing the\nhistory of the Reformation during its concluding epoch, and he\nchooses the Netherlands as his main subject, because during that\nperiod the Netherlands were the centre of the movement. They\nconstituted the great bulwark of freedom, and upon the success or\nfailure of their cause the future prospect of Europe and of\nmankind depended. Spain and the Netherlands, Philip II. and\nWilliam the Silent, were the two leading antagonists and were\nfelt to be such by the other nations and rulers that came to\nmingle in the strife. It is therefore a stupid criticism which we\nhave seen made upon Mr. Motley, that, having brought his\nnarrative down to the truce of 1609, he ought, instead of\ndescribing the Thirty Years’ War, to keep on with Dutch history,\nand pourtray the wars against Cromwell and Charles II., and the\nstruggle of the second William of Orange against Louis XIV. By so\ndoing he would only violate the unity of his narrative. The wars\nof the Dutch against England and France belong to an entirely\ndifferent epoch in European history,—a modern epoch, in which\npolitical and commercial interests were of prime importance, and\ntheological interests distinctly subsidiary. The natural terminus\nof Mr. Motley’s work is the Peace of Westphalia. After bringing\ndown his history to the time when the independence of the\nNetherlands was virtually acknowledged, after describing the\nprincipal stages of the struggle against Catholicism and\nuniversal monarchy, as carried on in the first generation by\nElizabeth and William, and in the second by Maurice and Henry, he\nwill naturally go on to treat of the epilogue as conducted by\nRichelieu and Gustavus, ending in the final cessation of\nreligious wars throughout Europe.",
        "The conflict in the Netherlands was indeed far more than a mere\nreligious struggle. In its course was distinctly brought into\nprominence the fact which we have above signalized, that since\nthe Roman Church had abandoned the liberties of the people they\nhad found a new defender in the reformed religion. The Dutch\nrebellion is peculiarly interesting, because it was a revolt not\nmerely against the Inquisition, but also against the temporal\nsovereignty of Philip. Besides changing their religion, the\nsturdy Netherlanders saw fit to throw off the sway of their\nlegitimate ruler, and to proclaim the thrice heretical doctrine\nof the sovereignty of the people. In this one respect their views\nwere decidedly more modern than those of Elizabeth and Henry IV.\nThese great monarchs apparently neither understood nor relished\nthe republican theories of the Hollanders; though it is hardly\nnecessary for Mr. Motley to sneer at them quite so often because\nthey were not to an impossible degree in advance of their age.\nThe proclamation of a republic in the Netherlands marked of\nitself the beginning of a new era,—an era when flourishing\ncommunities of men were no longer to be bought and sold,\ntransferred and bequeathed like real estate and chattels, but\nwere to have and maintain the right of choosing with whom and\nunder whom they should transact their affairs. The interminable\nnegotiations for a truce, which fill nearly one third of Mr.\nMotley’s concluding volume, exhibit with striking distinctness\nthe difference between the old and new points of view. Here again\nwe think Mr. Motley errs slightly, in calling too much attention\nto the prevaricating diplomacy of the Spanish court, and too\nlittle to its manifest inability to comprehend the demands of the\nNetherlanders. How should statesmen brought up under Philip II.\nand kept under the eye of the Inquisition be expected to\nunderstand a claim for liberty originating in the rights of the\ncommon people and not in the gracious benevolence or intelligent\npolicy of the King? The very idea must have been practically\ninconceivable by them. Accordingly, they strove by every\navailable device of chicanery to wheedle the Netherlanders into\naccepting their independence as a gift from the King of Spain.\nBut to such a piece of self-stultification the clear-sighted\nDutchmen could by no persuasion be brought to consent. Their\nindependence, they argued, was not the King’s to give. They had\nwon it from him and his father, in a war of forty years, during\nwhich they had suffered atrocious miseries, and all that the King\nof Spain could do was to acknowledge it as their right, and cease\nto molest them in future. Over this point, so simple to us but\nknotty enough in those days, the commissioners wrangled for\nnearly two years. And when the Spanish government, unable to\ncarry on the war any longer without risk of utter bankruptcy, and\ndaily crippled in its resources by the attacks of the Dutch navy,\ngrudgingly a reed to a truce upon the Netherlanders’ terms, it\nvirtually acknowledged its own defeat and the downfall of the\nprinciples for which it had so obstinately fought. By the truce\nof 1609 the republican principle was admitted by the most\ndespotic of governments.",
        "Here was the first great triumph of republicanism over monarchy;\nand it was not long in bearing fruits. For the Dutch revolution,\nthe settlement of America by English Puritans, the great\nrebellion of the Commons, the Revolution of 1688, the revolt of\nthe American Colonies, and the general overthrow of feudalism in\n1789, are but successive acts in the same drama William the\nSilent was the worthy forerunner of Cromwell and Washington; and\nbut for the victory which he won, during his life and after his\nuntimely death, the subsequent triumphs of civil liberty might\nhave been long, postponed.",
        "Over the sublime figure of William—saevis tranquillus in\nundis—we should be glad to dwell, but we are not reviewing the\n\"Rise of the Dutch Republic,” and in Mr. Motley’s present volumes\nthe hero of toleration appears no longer. His antagonist,\nhowever,—the Philip whom God for some inscrutable purpose\npermitted to afflict Europe during a reign of forty-two\nyears,—accompanies us nearly to the end of the present work,\ndying just in time for the historian to sum up the case against\nhim, and pronounce final judgment. For the memory of Philip II.\nMr. Motley cherishes no weak pity. He rarely alludes to him\nwithout commenting upon his total depravity, and he dismisses him\nwith the remark that “if there are vices—as possibly there\nare—from which he was exempt, it is because it is not permitted\nto human nature to attain perfection in evil.” The verdict is\nnone the less just because of its conciseness. If there ever was\na strife between Hercules and Cacus, between Ormuzd and Ahriman,\nbetween the Power of Light and the Power of Darkness, it was\ncertainly the strife between the Prince of Orange and the Spanish\nMonarch. They are contrasted like the light and shade in one of\nDore’s pictures. And yet it is perhaps unnecessary for Mr. Motley\nto say that if Philip had been alive when Spinola won for him the\ngreat victory of Ostend, “he would have felt it his duty to make\nimmediate arrangements for poisoning him.” Doubtless the\nimputation is sufficiently justified by what we know of Philip;\nbut it is uncalled for. We do not care to hear about what the\ndespot might have done. We know what he did do, and the record is\nsufficiently damning. There is no harm in our giving the Devil\nhis due, or as Llorente wittily says, “Il ne faut pas calomnier\nmeme l’Inquisition.”",
        "Philip inherited all his father’s bad qualities, without any of\nhis good ones; and so it is much easier to judge him than his\nfather. Charles, indeed, is one of those characters whom one\nhardly knows whether to love or hate, to admire or despise. He\nhad much bad blood in him. Charles the Bold and Ferdinand of\nAragon were not grandparents to be proud of. Yet with all this he\ninherited from his grandmother Isabella much that one can like,\nand his face, as preserved by Titian, in spite of its frowning\nbrow and thick Burgundian lip, is rather prepossessing, while the\nface of Philip is simply odious. In intellect he must probably be\ncalled great, though his policy often betrayed the pettiness of\nselfishness. If, in comparison with the mediaeval emperor whose\nfame he envied, he may justly be called Charles the Little, he\nmay still, when compared to a more modern emulator of\nCharlemagne,—the first of the Bonapartes,—be considered great\nand enlightened. If he could lie and cheat more consummately than\nany contemporary monarch, not excepting his rival, Francis, he\ncould still be grandly magnanimous, while the generosity of\nFrancis flowed only from the shallow surface of a maudlin\ngood-nature. He spoke many languages and had the tastes of a\nscholar, while his son had only the inclinations of an unfeeling\npedagogue. He had an inkling of urbanity, and could in a measure\nbecome all things to all men, while Philip could never show\nhimself except as a gloomy, impracticable bigot. It is for some\nsuch reasons as these, I suppose, that Mr. Buckle—no friend to\ndespots—speaks well of Charles, and that Mr. Froude is moved to\ntell the following anecdote: While standing by the grave of\nLuther, and musing over the strange career of the giant monk\nwhose teachings had gone so far to wreck his most cherished\nschemes and render his life a failure, some fanatical bystander\nadvised the Emperor to have the body taken up and burned in the\nmarket-place. “There was nothing,” says Mr. Froude, “unusual in\nthe proposal; it was the common practice of the Catholic Church\nwith the remains of heretics, who were held unworthy to be left\nin repose in hallowed ground. There was scarcely, perhaps another\nCatholic prince who would have hesitated to comply. But Charles\nwas one of nature’s gentlemen. He answered, ’I war not with the\ndead.’ “ Mr. Motley takes a less charitable view of the great\nEmperor. His generous indignation against all persecutors makes\nhim severe; and in one of his earlier volumes, while speaking of\nthe famous edicts for the suppression of heresy in the\nNetherlands, he somewhere uses the word “murder.” Without\nattempting to palliate the crime of persecution, I doubt if it is\nquite fair to Charles to call him a murderer. We must not forget\nthat persecution, now rightly deemed an atrocious crime, was once\nreally considered by some people a sacred duty; that it was none\nother than the compassionate Isabella who established the Spanish\nInquisition; and that the “bloody” Mary Tudor was a woman who\nwould not wilfully have done wrong. With the progress of\ncivilization the time will doubtless come when warfare, having\nceased to be necessary, will be thought highly criminal; yet it\nwill not then be fair to hold Marlborough or Wellington\naccountable for the lives lost in their great battles. We still\nlive in an age when war is, to the imagination of some persons,\nsurrounded with false glories; and the greatest of modern\ngenerals[32] has still many undiscriminating admirers. Yet the\nday is no less certainly at hand when the edicts of Charles V.\nwill be deemed a more pardonable offence against humanity than\nthe wanton march to Moscow.",
        "[32] This was written before the deeds of Moltke had eclipsed\nthose of Napoleon.",
        "Philip II. was different from his father in capacity as a\ndrudging clerk, like Boutwell, is different from a brilliant\nfinancier like Gladstone. In organization he differed from him as\na boor differs from a gentleman. He seemed made of a coarser\nclay. The difference between them is well indicated by their\ntastes at the table. Both were terrible gluttons, a fact which\npuritanic criticism might set down as equally to the discredit of\neach of them. But even in intemperance there are degrees of\nrefinement, and the impartial critic of life and manners will no\ndoubt say that if one must get drunk, let it be on Chateau\nMargaux rather than on commissary whiskey. Pickled partridges,\nplump capons, syrups of fruits, delicate pastry, and rare fish\nwent to make up the diet of Charles in his last days at Yuste.\nBut the beastly Philip would make himself sick with a surfeit of\nunderdone pork.",
        "Whatever may be said of the father, we can hardly go far wrong in\nascribing the instincts of a murderer to the son. He not only\nburned heretics, but he burned them with an air of enjoyment and\nself-complacency. His nuptials with Elizabeth of France were\ncelebrated by a vast auto-da-fe. He studied murder as a fine art,\nand was as skilful in private assassinations as Cellini was in\nengraving on gems. The secret execution of Montigny, never\nbrought to light until the present century, was a veritable chef\nd’oeuvre of this sort. The cases of Escobedo and Antonio Perez\nmay also be cited in point. Dark suspicions hung around the\npremature death of Don John of Austria, his too brilliant and\npopular half-brother. He planned the murder of William the\nSilent, and rewarded the assassin with an annuity furnished by\nthe revenues of the victim’s confiscated estates. He kept a staff\nof ruffians constantly in service for the purpose of taking off\nElizabeth, Henry IV., Prince Maurice, Olden-Barneveldt, and St.\nAldegonde. He instructed Alva to execute sentence of death upon\nthe whole population of the Netherlands. He is partly responsible\nfor the martyrdoms of Ridley and Latimer, and the judicial murder\nof Cranmer. He first conceived the idea of the wholesale massacre\nof St. Bartholomew, many years before Catharine de’ Medici\ncarried it into operation. His ingratitude was as dangerous as\nhis revengeful fanaticism. Those who had best served his\ninterests were the least likely to escape the consequences of his\njealousy. He destroyed Egmont, who had won for him the splendid\nvictories of St. Quentin and Gravelines; and “with minute and\nartistic treachery” he plotted “the disgrace and ruin” of\nFarnese, “the man who was his near blood-relation, and who had\nserved him most faithfully from earliest youth.” Contemporary\nopinion even held him accountable for the obscure deaths of his\nwife Elizabeth and his son Carlos; but M. Gachard has shown that\nthis suspicion is unfounded. Philip appears perhaps to better\nadvantage in his domestic than in his political relations. Yet he\nwas addicted to vulgar and miscellaneous incontinence; toward the\nclose of his life he seriously contemplated marrying his own\ndaughter Isabella; and he ended by taking for his fourth wife his\nniece, Anne of Austria, who became the mother of his half-idiotic\nson and successor. We know of no royal family, unless it may be\nthe Claudians of Rome, in which the transmission of moral and\nintellectual qualities is more thoroughly illustrated than in\nthis Burgundian race which for two centuries held the sceptre of\nSpain. The son Philip and the grandmother Isabella are both\nneedful in order to comprehend the strange mixture of good and\nevil in Charles. But the descendants of Philip—two generations\nof idiocy, and a third of utter impotence—are a sufficient\ncommentary upon the organization and character of their\nprogenitor.",
        "Such was the man who for two generations had been considered the\nbulwark of the Catholic Church; who, having been at the bottom of\nnearly all the villany that had been wrought in Europe for half a\ncentury, was yet able to declare upon his death-bed that “in all\nhis life he had never consciously done wrong to any one.” At a\nripe old age he died of a fearful disease. Under the influence of\na typhus fever, supervening upon gout, he had begun to decompose\nwhile yet alive. “His sufferings,” says Mr. Motley, “were\nhorrible, but no saint could have manifested in them more gentle\nresignation or angelic patience. He moralized on the condition to\nwhich the greatest princes might thus be brought at last by the\nhand of God, and bade the Prince observe well his father’s\npresent condition, in order that when he too should be laid thus\nlow, he might likewise be sustained by a conscience void of\noffence.” What more is needed to complete the disgusting picture?\nPhilip was fanatical up to the point where fanaticism borders\nupon hypocrisy. He was possessed with a “great moral idea,” the\nidea of making Catholicism the ruler of the world, that he might\nbe the ruler of Catholicism. Why, it may be said, shall the\ncharge of fanaticism be allowed to absolve Isabella and extenuate\nthe guilt of Charles, while it only strengthens the case against\nPhilip? Because Isabella persecuted heretics in order to save\ntheir souls from a worse fate, while Philip burnt them in order\nto get them out of his way. Isabella would perhaps have gone to\nthe stake herself, if thereby she might have put an end to\nheresy. Philip would have seen every soul in Europe consigned to\neternal perdition before he would have yielded up an iota of his\nclaims to universal dominion. He could send Alva to browbeat the\nPope, as well as to oppress the Netherlanders. He could compass\nthe destruction of the orthodox Egmont and Farnese, as well as of\nthe heretical William. His unctuous piety only adds to the\nabhorrence with which we regard him; and his humility in face of\ndeath is neither better nor worse than the assumed humility which\nhad become second nature to Uriah Heep. In short, take him for\nall in all, he was probably the most loathsome character in all\nEuropean history. He has frequently been called, by Protestant\nhistorians, an incarnate devil; but we do not think that\nMephistopheles would acknowledge him. He should rather be classed\namong those creatures described by Dante as “a Dio spiacenti ed\nai nemici sui.”",
        "The abdication of Charles V. left Philip ruler over wider\ndominions than had ever before been brought together under the\nsway of one man. In his own right Philip was master not only of\nSpain, but of the Netherlands, Franche Comte, Lombardy, Naples,\nand Sicily, with the whole of North and South America; besides\nwhich he was married to the Queen of England. In the course of\nhis reign he became possessed of Portugal, with all its vast\ndomains in the East Indies. His revenues were greater than those\nof any other contemporary monarch; his navy was considered\ninvincible, and his army was the best disciplined in Europe. All\nthese great advantages he was destined to throw to the winds. In\nthe strife for universal monarchy, in the mad endeavour to\nsubject England, Scotland, and France to his own dominion and the\ntyranny of the Inquisition, besides re-conquering the\nNetherlands, all his vast resources were wasted. The Dutch war\nalone, like a bottomless pit, absorbed all that he could pour\ninto it. Long before the war was over, or showed signs of drawing\nto an end, his revenues were wasted, and his troops in Flanders\nwere mutinous for want of pay. He had to rely upon energetic\nviceroys like Farnese and the Spinolas to furnish funds out of\ntheir own pockets. Finally, he was obliged to repudiate all his\ndebts; and when he died the Spanish empire was in such a beggarly\ncondition that it quaked at every approach of a hostile Dutch\nfleet. Such a result is not evidence of a statesmanlike ability;\nbut Philip’s fanatical selfishness was incompatible with\nstatesmanship. He never could be made to believe that his\nprojects had suffered defeat. No sooner had the Invincible Armada\nbeen sent to the bottom by the guns of the English fleet and the\ngales of the German Ocean, than he sent orders to Farnese to\ninvade England at once with the land force under his command! He\nthought to obtain Scotland, when, after the death of Mary, it had\npassed under the undisputed control of the Protestant noblemen.\nHe dreamed of securing for his family the crown of France, even\nafter Henry, with free consent of the Pope, had made his\ntriumphal entry into Paris. He asserted complete and entire\nsovereignty over the Netherlands, even after Prince Maurice had\nwon back from him the last square foot of Dutch territory. Such\nobstinacy as this can only be called fatuity. If Philip had lived\nin Pagan times, he would doubtless, like Caligula, have demanded\nrecognition of his own divinity.",
        "The miserable condition of the Spanish people under this terrible\nreign, and the causes of their subsequent degeneracy, have been\nwell treated by Mr. Motley. The causes of the failure of Spanish\ncivilization are partly social and partly economical; and they\nhad been operating for eight hundred years when Philip succeeded\nto the throne. The Moorish conquest in 711 had practically\nisolated Spain from the rest of Europe. In the Crusades she took\nno part, and reaped none of the signal advantages resulting from\nthat great movement. Her whole energies were directed toward\nthrowing off the yoke of her civilized but “unbelieving\"\noppressors. For a longer time than has now elapsed since the\nNorman Conquest of England, the entire Gothic population of Spain\nwas engaged in unceasing religious and patriotic warfare. The\nunlimited power thus acquired by an unscrupulous clergy, and the\nspirit of uncompromising bigotry thus imparted to the whole\nnation, are in this way readily accounted for. But in spite of\nthis, the affairs of Spain at the accession of Charles V. were\nnot in an unpromising condition. The Spanish Visigoths had been\nthe least barbarous of the Teutonic settlers within the limits of\nthe Empire; their civil institutions were excellent; their cities\nhad obtained municipal liberties at an earlier date than those of\nEngland; and their Parliaments indulged in a liberty of speech\nwhich would have seemed extravagant even to De Montfort. So late\nas the time of Ferdinand, the Spaniards were still justly proud\nof their freedom; and the chivalrous ambition which inspired the\nmarvellous expedition of Cortes to Mexico, and covered the soil\nof Italy with Spanish armies, was probably in the main a healthy\none. But the forces of Spanish freedom were united at too late an\nepoch; in 1492, the power of despotism was already in the\nascendant. In England the case was different. The barons were\nenabled to combine and wrest permanent privileges from the crown,\nat a time when feudalism was strong. But the Spanish communes\nwaited for combined action until feudalism had become weak, and\nmodern despotism, with its standing armies and its control of the\nspiritual power, was arrayed in the ranks against them. The War\nof the Communes, early in the reign of Charles V., irrevocably\ndecided the case in favour of despotism, and from that date the\ninternal decline of Spain may be said to have begun.",
        "But the triumphant consolidation of the spiritual and temporal\npowers of despotism, and the abnormal development of loyalty and\nbigotry, were not the only evil results of the chronic struggle\nin which Spain had been engaged. For many centuries, while\nChristian Spain had been but a fringe of debatable border-land on\nthe skirts of the Moorish kingdom, perpetual guerilla warfare had\nrendered consecutive labour difficult or impracticable; and the\nphysical configuration of the country contributed in bringing\nabout this result. To plunder the Moors across the border was\neasier than to till the ground at home. Then as the Spaniards,\nexemplifying the military superiority of the feudal over the\nsultanic form of social organization, proceeded steadily to\nrecover dominion over the land, the industrious Moors, instead of\nmigrating backward before the advance of their conquerors,\nremained at home and submitted to them. Thus Spanish society\nbecame compounded of two distinct castes,—the Moorish Spaniards,\nwho were skilled labourers, and the Gothic Spaniards, by whom all\nlabour, crude or skilful, was deemed the stigma of a conquered\nrace, and unworthy the attention of respectable people. As Mr.\nMotley concisely says:—",
        "“The highest industrial and scientific civilization that had been\nexhibited upon Spanish territory was that of Moors and Jews. When\nin the course of time those races had been subjugated, massacred,\nor driven into exile, not only was Spain deprived of its highest\nintellectual culture and its most productive labour, but\nintelligence, science, and industry were accounted degrading,\nbecause the mark of inferior and detested peoples.”",
        "This is the key to the whole subsequent history of Spain.\nBigotry, loyalty, and consecrated idleness are the three factors\nwhich have made that great country what it is to-day,—the most\nbackward region in Europe. In view of the circumstances just\nnarrated, it is not surprising to learn that in Philip II.’s time\na vast portion of the real estate of the country was held by the\nChurch in mortmain; that forty-nine noble families owned all the\nrest; that all great estates were held in tail; and that the\nproperty of the aristocracy and the clergy was completely exempt\nfrom taxation. Thus the accumulation and the diffusion of capital\nwere alike prevented; and the few possessors of property wasted\nit in unproductive expenditure. Hence the fundamental error of\nSpanish political economy, that wealth is represented solely by\nthe precious metals; an error which well enough explains the\ntotal failure, in spite of her magnificent opportunities, of\nSpain’s attempts to colonize the New World. Such was the\nfrightful condition of Spanish society under Philip II.; and as\nif this state of things were not bad enough, the next king,\nPhilip III., at the instigation of the clergy, decided to drive\ninto banishment the only class of productive labourers yet\nremaining in the country. In 1610, this stupendous crime and\nblunder—unparalleled even in Spanish history—was perpetrated.\nThe entire Moorish population were expelled from their homes and\ndriven into the deserts of Africa. For the awful consequences of\nthis mad action no remedy was possible. No system of native\nindustry could be created on demand, to take the place of that\nwhich had been thus wantonly crushed forever. From this epoch\ndates the social ruin of Spain. In less than a century her people\nwere riotous with famine; and every sequestered glen and mountain\npathway throughout the country had become a lurking-place for\nrobbers. Whoever would duly realize to what a lamentable\ncondition this beautiful peninsula had in the seventeenth century\nbeen reduced, let him study the immortal pages of Lesage. He will\nlearn afresh the lesson, not yet sufficiently regarded in the\ndiscussion of social problems, that the laws of nature cannot be\nviolated without entailing a penalty fearful in proportion to the\nextent of the violation. But let him carefully remember also that\nthe Spaniards are not and never have been a despicable people. If\nSpain has produced one of the lowest characters in history, she\nhas also produced one of the highest. That man was every inch a\nSpaniard who, maimed, diseased, and poor, broken down by long\ncaptivity, and harassed by malignant persecution, lived\nnevertheless a life of grandeur and beauty fit to be a pattern\nfor coming generations,—the author of a book which has had a\nwider fame than any other in the whole range of secular\nliterature, and which for delicate humour, exquisite pathos, and\ndeep ethical sentiment, remains to-day without a peer or a rival.\nIf Philip II. was a Spaniard, so, too, was Cervantes.",
        "Spain could not be free, for she violated every condition by\nwhich freedom is secured to a people. “Acuteness of intellect,\nwealth of imagination, heroic qualities of heart and hand and\nbrain, rarely surpassed in any race and manifested on a thousand\nbattle-fields, and in the triumphs of a magnificent and most\noriginal literature, had not been able to save a whole nation\nfrom the disasters and the degradation which the mere words\nPhilip II. and the Holy Inquisition suggest to every educated\nmind.” Nor could Spain possibly become rich, for, as Mr. Motley\ncontinues, “nearly every law, according to which the prosperity\nof a country becomes progressive, was habitually violated.” On\nturning to the Netherlands we find the most complete contrast,\nboth in historical conditions and in social results; and the\nsuccess of the Netherlands in their long struggle becomes easily\nintelligible. The Dutch and Flemish provinces had formed a part\nof the renovated Roman Empire of Charles the Great and the Othos.\nTaking advantage of the perennial contest for supremacy between\nthe popes and the Roman emperors, the constituent baronies and\nmunicipalities of the Empire succeeded in acquiring and\nmaintaining a practical though unrecognized independence; and\nthis is the original reason why Italy and Germany, unlike the\nthree western European communities, have remained fragmentary\nuntil our own time. By reason of the practical freedom of action\nthus secured, the Italian civic republics, the Hanse towns, and\nthe cities of Holland and Flanders, were enabled gradually to\ndevelop a vast commerce. The outlying position of the\nNetherlands, remote from the imperial authorities, and on the\ndirect line of commerce between Italy and England, was another\nand a peculiar advantage. Throughout the Middle Ages the Flemish\nand Dutch cities were of considerable political importance, and\nin the fifteenth century the Netherland provinces were the most\nhighly civilized portion of Europe north of the Alps. For several\ngenerations they had enjoyed, and had known how to maintain,\ncivic liberties, and when Charles and Philip attempted to fasten\nupon them their “peculiar institution,” the Spanish Inquisition,\nthey were ripe for political as well as theological revolt.\nNatural laws were found to operate on the Rhine as well as on the\nTagus, and at the end of the great war of independence, Holland\nwas not only better equipped than Spain for a European conflict,\nbut was rapidly ousting her from the East Indian countries which\nshe had in vain attempted to colonize.",
        "But if we were to take up all the interesting and instructive\nthemes suggested by Mr. Motley’s work, we should never come to an\nend. We must pass over the exciting events narrated in these last\nvolumes; the victory of Nieuport, the siege of Ostend, the\nmarvellous career of Maurice, the surprising exploits of Spinola.\nWe have attempted not so much to describe Mr. Motley’s book as to\nindulge in sundry reflections suggested by the perusal of it. But\nwe cannot close without some remarks upon a great man, whose\ncharacter Mr. Motley seems to have somewhat misconceived.",
        "If Mr. Motley exhibits any serious fault, it is perhaps the\nnatural tendency to TAKE SIDES in the events which he is\ndescribing, which sometimes operates as a drawback to complete\nand thoroughgoing criticism. With every intention to do justice\nto the Catholics, Mr. Motley still writes as a Protestant,\nviewing all questions from the Protestant side. He praises and\ncondemns like a very fair-minded Huguenot, but still like a\nHuguenot. It is for this reason that he fails to interpret\ncorrectly the very complex character of Henry IV., regarding him\nas a sort of selfish renegade whom he cannot quite forgive for\naccepting the crown of France at the hands of the Pope. Now this\nvery action of Henry, in the eye of an impartial criticism, must\nseem to be one of his chief claims to the admiration and\ngratitude of posterity. Henry was more than a mere Huguenot: he\nwas a far-seeing statesman. He saw clearly what no ruler before\nhim, save William the Silent, had even dimly discerned, that not\nCatholicism and not Protestantism, but absolute spiritual freedom\nwas the true end to be aimed at by a righteous leader of opinion.\nIt was as a Catholic sovereign that he could be most useful even\nto his Huguenot subjects; and he shaped his course accordingly.\nIt was as an orthodox sovereign, holding his position by the\ngeneral consent of Europe, that he could best subserve the\ninterests of universal toleration. This principle he embodied in\nhis admirable edict of Nantes. What a Huguenot prince might have\ndone, may be seen from the shameful way in which the French\nCalvinists abused the favour which Henry—and Richelieu\nafterwards—accorded to them. Remembering how Calvin himself\n\"dragooned” Geneva, let us be thankful for the fortune which, in\none of the most critical periods of history, raised to the\nhighest position in Christendom a man who was something more than\na sectarian.",
        "With this brief criticism, we must regretfully take leave of Mr.\nMotley’s work. Much more remains to be said about a historical\ntreatise which is, on the whole, the most valuable and important\none yet produced by an American; but we have already exceeded our\nlimits. We trust that our author will be as successful in the\nfuture as he has been in the past; and that we shall soon have an\nopportunity of welcoming the first instalment of his “History of\nthe Thirty Years’ War.”",

        "[33] The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri. Translated by Henry\nWadsworth Longfellow. 3 vols. Boston: Ticknor & Fields, 1867.",
        "THE task of a translator is a thankless one at best. Be he never\nso skilful and accurate, be he never so amply endowed with the\ndivine qualifications of the poet, it is still questionable if he\ncan ever succeed in saying satisfactorily with new words that\nwhich has once been inimitably said—said for all time—with the\nold words. Psychologically, there is perhaps nothing more complex\nthan an elaborate poem. The sources of its effect upon our minds\nmay be likened to a system of forces which is in the highest\ndegree unstable; and the slightest displacement of phrases, by\ndisturbing the delicate rhythmical equilibrium of the whole, must\ninevitably awaken a jarring sensation.” Matthew Arnold has given\nus an excellent series of lectures upon translating Homer, in\nwhich he doubtless succeeds in showing that some methods of\ntranslation are preferable to others, but in which he proves\nnothing so forcibly as that the simplicity and grace, the\nrapidity, dignity, and fire, of Homer are quite incommunicable,\nsave by the very words in which they first found expression. And\nwhat is thus said of Homer will apply to Dante with perhaps even\ngreater force. With nearly all of Homer’s grandeur and rapidity,\nthough not with nearly all his simplicity, the poem of Dante\nmanifests a peculiar intensity of subjective feeling which was\nforeign to the age of Homer, as indeed to all pre-Christian\nantiquity. But concerning this we need not dilate, as it has\noften been duly remarked upon, and notably by Carlyle, in his\n\"Lectures on Hero-Worship.” Who that has once heard the wail of\nunutterable despair sounding in the line",
        "can rest satisfied with the interpretation",
        "yet this rendering is literally exact.",
        "[34] As Dante himself observes, “E pero sappia ciascuno, che\nnulla cosa per legame musaico armonizzata si puo della sue\nloquela in altra trasmutare sanza rompere tutta sue dolcezza e\narmonia. E questa e la ragione per che Omero non si muto di greco\nin latino, come l’altre scritture che avemo da loro: e questa e\nla ragione per che i versi del Psaltero sono sanza dolcezza di\nmusica e d’armonia; che essi furono trasmutati d’ ebreo in\ngreco, e di greco in latino, e nella prima trasmutazione tutta\nquella dolcezza venne meno.” Convito, I. 7, Opere Minori, Tom.\nIII. p. 80. The noble English version of the Psalms possesses a\nbeauty which is all its own.",
        "A second obstacle, hardly less formidable, hardly less fatal to a\nsatisfactory translation, is presented by the highly complicated\nsystem of triple rhyme upon which Dante’s poem is constructed.\nThis, which must ever be a stumbling-block to the translator,\nseems rarely to interfere with the free and graceful movement of\nthe original work. The mighty thought of the master felt no\nimpediment from the elaborate artistic panoply which must needs\nobstruct and harass the interpretation of the disciple. Dante’s\nterza rima is a bow of Odysseus which weaker mortals cannot bend\nwith any amount of tugging, and which Mr. Longfellow has\njudiciously refrained from trying to bend. Yet no one can fail to\nremark the prodigious loss entailed by this necessary sacrifice\nof one of the most striking characteristics of the original poem.\nLet any one who has duly reflected upon the strange and subtle\neffect produced on him by the peculiar rhyme of Tennyson’s “In\nMemoriam,” endeavour to realize the very different effect which\nwould be produced if the verses were to be alternated or coupled\nin successive pairs, or if rhyme were to be abandoned for blank\nverse. The exquisite melody of the poem would be silenced. The\nrhyme-system of the “Divine Comedy” refuses equally to be\ntampered with or ignored. Its effect upon the ear and the mind is\nquite as remarkable as that of the rhyme-system of “In Memoriam\";\nand the impossibility of reproducing it is one good reason why\nDante must always suffer even more from translation than most\npoets.",
        "Something, too, must be said of the difficulties inevitably\narising from the diverse structure and genius of the Italian and\nEnglish languages. None will deny that many of them are\ninsurmountable. Take the third line of the first canto,—",
        "which Mr. Longfellow translates",
        "Perhaps there is no better word than “lost” by which to translate\nsmarrita in this place; yet the two words are far from equivalent\nin force. About the word smarrita there is thrown a wide penumbra\nof meaning which does not belong to the word lost.[35] By its\ndiffuse connotations the word smarrita calls up in our minds an\nadequate picture of the bewilderment and perplexity of one who is\nlost in a trackless forest. The high-road with out, beaten hard\nby incessant overpassing of men and beasts and wheeled vehicles,\ngradually becomes metamorphosed into the shady lane, where grass\nsprouts up rankly between the ruts, where bushes encroach upon\nthe roadside, where fallen trunks now and then intercept the\ntraveller; and this in turn is lost in crooked by-ways, amid\nbrambles and underbrush and tangled vines, growing fantastically\nathwart the path, shooting up on all sides of tile bewildered\nwanderer, and rendering advance and retreat alike hopeless. No\none who in childhood has wandered alone in the woods can help\nfeeling all this suggested by the word smarrita in this passage.\nHow bald in comparison is the word lost, which might equally be\napplied to a pathway, a reputation, and a pocket-book![36] The\nEnglish is no doubt the most copious and variously expressive of\nall living languages, yet I doubt if it can furnish any word\ncapable by itself of calling up the complex images here suggested\nby smarrita.[37] And this is but one example, out of many that\nmight be cited, in which the lack of exact parallelism between\nthe two languages employed causes every translation to suffer.",
        "[35] See Diez, Romance Dictionary, s. v. “Marrir.”\n\n[36] On literally retranslating lost into Italian, we should get\nthe quite different word perduta.\n\n[37] The more flexible method of Dr. Parsons leads to a more\nsatisfactory but still inadequate result:—\n  “Half-way on our life’s Journey, in a wood,\n   From the right path I found myself astray.”",
        "All these, however, are difficulties which lie in the nature of\nthings,—difficulties for which the translator is not\nresponsible; of which he must try to make the best that can be\nmade, but which he can never expect wholly to surmount. We have\nnow to inquire whether there are not other difficulties,\navoidable by one method of translation, though not by another;\nand in criticizing Mr. Longfellow, we have chiefly to ask whether\nhe has chosen the best method of translation,—that which most\nsurely and readily awakens in the reader’s mind the ideas and\nfeelings awakened by the original.",
        "The translator of a poem may proceed upon either of two distinct\nprinciples. In the first case, he may render the text of his\noriginal into English, line for line and word for word,\npreserving as far as possible its exact verbal sequences, and\ntranslating each individual word into an English word as nearly\nas possible equivalent in its etymological force. In the second\ncase, disregarding mere syntactic and etymologic equivalence, his\naim will be to reproduce the inner meaning and power of the\noriginal, so far as the constitutional difference of the two\nlanguages will permit him.",
        "It is the first of these methods that Mr. Longfellow has followed\nin his translation of Dante. Fidelity to the text of the original\nhas been his guiding principle; and every one must admit that, in\ncarrying out that principle, he has achieved a degree of success\nalike delightful and surprising. The method of literal\ntranslation is not likely to receive any more splendid\nillustration. It is indeed put to the test in such a way that the\nshortcomings now to be noticed bear not upon Mr. Longfellow’s own\nstyle of work so much as upon the method itself with which they\nare necessarily implicated. These defects are, first, the too\nfrequent use of syntactic inversion, and secondly, the too\nmanifest preference extended to words of Romanic over words of\nSaxon origin.",
        "To illustrate the first point, let me give a few examples. In\nCanto I. we have:—",
        "which is thus rendered by Mr. Cary,—",
        "and by Dr. Parsons,—",
        "Inferno, I. 7-10.",
        "Again in Canto X. we find:—",
        "an inversion which is perhaps not more unidiomatic than Mr.\nCary’s,—",
        "but which is advantageously avoided by Mr. Wright,—",
        "and is still better rendered by Dr. Parsons,—",
        "[39] “Suo cimitero da questa parte hanno\n   Con Epieuro tutti i suoi seguaci,\n   Che l’anima col corpo morta fanno.\"\n   Inferno, X. 13-15.",
        "And here my eyes, reverting to the end of Canto IX.,",
        "fall upon a similar contrast between Mr. Longfellow’s lines,—",
        "and those of Dr. Parsons,—",
        "[40] “Che tra gli avelli flamme erano sparte,\n   Per le quali eran si del tutto accesi,\n   Che ferro piu non chiede verun’ arte.\"\n   Inferno, IX. 118-120.",
        "Does it not seem that in all these cases Mr. Longfellow, and to a\nslightly less extent Mr. Cary, by their strict adherence to the\nletter, transgress the ordinary rules of English construction;\nand that Dr. Parsons, by his comparative freedom of movement,\nproduces better poetry as well as better English? In the last\nexample especially, Mr. Longfellow’s inversions are so violent\nthat to a reader ignorant of the original Italian, his sentence\nmight be hardly intelligible. In Italian such inversions are\npermissible; in English they are not; and Mr. Longfellow, by\ntransplanting them into English, sacrifices the spirit to the\nletter, and creates an obscurity in the translation where all is\nlucidity in the original. Does not this show that the theory of\nabsolute literality, in the case of two languages so widely\ndifferent as English and Italian, is not the true one?",
        "Secondly, Mr. Longfellow’s theory of translation leads him in\nmost cases to choose words of Romanic origin in preference to\nthose of Saxon descent, and in many cases to choose an unfamiliar\ninstead of a familiar Romanic word, because the former happens to\nbe etymologically identical with the word in the original. Let me\ncite as an example the opening of Canto III.:—",
        "Here are three lines which, in their matchless simplicity and\ngrandeur, might well excite despair in the breast of any\ntranslator. Let us contrast Mr. Longfellow’s version.—",
        "with that of Dr. Parsons,—,",
        "I do not think any one will deny that Dr. Parsons’s version,\nwhile far more remote than Mr. Longfellow’s from the diction of\nthe original, is somewhat nearer its spirit. It remains to seek\nthe explanation of this phenomenon. It remains to be seen why\nwords the exact counterpart of Dante’s are unfit to call up in\nour minds the feelings which Dante’s own words call up in the\nmind of an Italian. And this inquiry leads to some general\nconsiderations respecting the relation of English to other\nEuropean languages.",
        "Every one is aware that French poetry, as compared with German\npoetry, seems to the English reader very tame and insipid; but\nthe cause of this fact is by no means so apparent as the fact\nitself. That the poetry of Germany is actually and intrinsically\nsuperior to that of France, may readily be admitted; but this is\nnot enough to account for all the circumstances of the case. It\ndoes not explain why some of the very passages in Corneille and\nRacine, which to us appear dull and prosaic, are to the\nFrenchman’s apprehension instinct with poetic fervour. It does\nnot explain the undoubted fact that we, who speak English, are\nprone to underrate French poetry, while we are equally disposed\nto render to German poetry even more than its due share of merit.\nThe reason is to be sought in the verbal associations established\nin our minds by the peculiar composition of the English language.\nOur vocabulary is chiefly made up on the one hand of indigenous\nSaxon words, and on the other hand of words derived from Latin or\nFrench. It is mostly words of the first class that we learn in\nchildhood, and that are associated with our homeliest and deepest\nemotions; while words of the second class—usually acquired\nsomewhat later in life and employed in sedate abstract\ndiscourse—have an intellectual rather than an emotional function\nto fulfil. Their original significations, the physical metaphors\ninvolved in them, which are perhaps still somewhat apparent to\nthe Frenchman, are to us wholly non-existent. Nothing but the\nderivative or metaphysical signification remains. No physical\nimage of a man stepping over a boundary is presented to our minds\nby the word transgress, nor in using the word comprehension do we\npicture to ourselves any manual act of grasping. It is to this\ndouble structure of the English language that it owes its\nsuperiority over every other tongue, ancient or modern, for\nphilosophical and scientific purposes. Albeit there are numerous\nexceptions, it may still be safely said, in a general way, that\nwe possess and habitually use two kinds of language,—one that is\nphysical, for our ordinary purposes, and one that is\nmetaphysical, for purposes of abstract reasoning and discussion.\nWe do not say like the Germans, that we “begripe” (begreifen) an\nidea, but we say that we “conceive” it. We use a word which once\nhad the very same material meaning as begreifen, but which has in\nour language utterly lost it. We are accordingly able to carry on\nphilosophical inquiries by means of words which are nearly or\nquite free from those shadows of original concrete meaning which,\nin German, too often obscure the acquired abstract signification.\nWhoever has dealt in English and German metaphysics will not fail\nto recognize the prodigious superiority of English in force and\nperspicuity, arising mainly from the causes here stated. But\nwhile this homogeneity of structure in German injures it for\nphilosophical purposes, it is the very thing which makes it so\nexcellent as an organ for poetical expression, in the opinion of\nthose who speak English. German being nearly allied to\nAnglo-Saxon, not only do its simple words strike us with all the\nforce of our own homely Saxon terms, but its compounds also,\npreserving their physical significations almost unimpaired, call\nup in our minds concrete images of the greatest definiteness and\nliveliness. It is thus that German seems to us pre-eminently a\npoetical language, and it is thus that we are naturally inclined\nto overrate rather than to depreciate the poetry that is written\nin it.",
        "With regard to French, the case is just the reverse. The\nFrenchman has no Saxon words, but he has, on the other hand, an\nindigenous stock of Latin words, which he learns in early\nchildhood, which give outlet to his most intimate feelings, and\nwhich retain to some extent their primitive concrete\npicturesqueness. They are to him just as good as our Saxon words\nare to us. Though cold and merely intellectual to us, they are to\nhim warm with emotion; and this is one reason why we cannot do\njustice to his poetry, or appreciate it as he appreciates it. To\nmake this perfectly clear, let us take two or three lines from\nShakespeare:—",
        "which I have somewhere seen thus rendered into French:",
        "Why are we inclined to laugh as we read this? Because it excites\nin us an undercurrent of consciousness which, if put into words,\nmight run something like this:—",
        "No such effect would be produced upon a Frenchman. The\ntranslation would strike him as excellent, which it really is.\nThe last line in particular would seem poetical to us, did we not\nhappen to have in our language words closely akin to dent and\npenetrante, and familiarly employed in senses that are not\npoetical.",
        "Applying these considerations to Mr. Longfellow’s choice of words\nin his translation of Dante, we see at once the unsoundness of\nthe principle that Italian words should be rendered by their\nRomanic equivalents in English. Words that are etymologically\nidentical with those in the original are often, for that very\nreason, the worst words that could be used. They are harsh and\nforeign to the English ear, however homelike and musical they may\nbe to the ear of an Italian. Their connotations are unlike in the\ntwo languages; and the translation which is made literally exact\nby using them is at the same time made actually inaccurate, or at\nleast inadequate. Dole and dolent are doubtless the exact\ncounterparts of dolore and dolente, so far as mere etymology can\ngo. But when we consider the effect that is to be produced upon\nthe mind of the reader, wretchedness and despairing are fat\nbetter equivalents. The former may compel our intellectual\nassent, but the latter awaken our emotional sympathy.",
        "Doubtless by long familiarity with the Romanic languages, the\nscholar becomes to a great degree emancipated from the conditions\nimposed upon him by the peculiar composition of his native\nEnglish. The concrete significance of the Romanic words becomes\napparent to him, and they acquire energy and vitality. The\nexpression dolent may thus satisfy the student familiar with\nItalian, because it calls up in his mind, through the medium of\nits equivalent dolente, the same associations which the latter\ncalls up in the mind of the Italian himself.[41] But this power\nof appreciating thoroughly the beauties of a foreign tongue is in\nthe last degree an acquired taste,—as much so as the taste for\nolives and kirschenwasser to the carnal palate. It is only by\nlong and profound study that we can thus temporarily vest\nourselves, so to speak, with a French or Italian consciousness in\nexchange for our English one. The literary epicure may keenly\nrelish such epithets as dolent; but the common English reader,\nwho loves plain fare, can hardly fail to be startled by it. To\nhim it savours of the grotesque; and if there is any one thing\nespecially to be avoided in the interpretation of Dante, it is\ngrotesqueness.",
        "[41] A consummate Italian scholar, the delicacy of whose taste is\nquestioned by no one, and whose knowledge of Dante’s diction is\nprobably not inferior to Mr. Longfellow’s, has told me that he\nregards the expression as a noble and effective one, full of\ndignity and solemnity.",
        "Those who have read over Dante without reading into him, and\nthose who have derived their impressions of his poem from M.\nDore’s memorable illustrations, will here probably demur. What!\nDante not grotesque! That tunnel-shaped structure of the infernal\npit; Minos passing sentence on the damned by coiling his tail;\nCharon beating the lagging shades with his oar; Antaios picking\nup the poets with his fingers and lowering them in the hollow of\nhis hand into the Ninth Circle; Satan crunching in his monstrous\njaws the arch-traitors, Judas, Brutus and Cassius; Ugolino\nappeasing his famine upon the tough nape of Ruggieri; Bertrand de\nBorn looking (if I may be allowed the expression) at his own\ndissevered head; the robbers exchanging form with serpents; the\nwhole demoniac troop of Malebolge,—are not all these things\ngrotesque beyond everything else in poetry? To us, nurtured in\nthis scientific nineteenth century, they doubtless seem so; and\nby Leigh Hunt, who had the eighteenth-century way of appreciating\nother ages than his own, they were uniformly treated as such. To\nus they are at first sight grotesque, because they are no longer\nreal to us. We have ceased to believe in such things, and they no\nlonger awaken any feeling akin to terror. But in the thirteenth\ncentury, in the minds of Dante and his readers, they were living,\nterrible realities. That Dante believed literally in all this\nunearthly world, and described it with such wonderful minuteness\nbecause he believed in it, admits of little doubt. As he walked\nthe streets of Verona the people whispered, “See, there is the\nman who has been in hell!” Truly, he had been in hell, and\ndescribed it as he had seen it, with the keen eyes of imagination\nand faith. With all its weird unearthliness, there is hardly\nanother book in the whole range of human literature which is\nmarked with such unswerving veracity as the “Divine Comedy.\"\nNothing is there set down arbitrarily, out of wanton caprice or\nfor the sake of poetic effect, but because to Dante’s imagination\nit had so imposingly shown itself that he could not but describe\nit as he saw it. In reading his cantos we forget the poet, and\nhave before us only the veracious traveller in strange realms,\nfrom whom the shrewdest cross-examination can elicit but one\nconsistent account. To his mind, and to the mediaeval mind\ngenerally, this outer kingdom, with its wards of Despair,\nExpiation, and Beatitude, was as real as the Holy Roman Empire\nitself. Its extraordinary phenomena were not to be looked on with\ncritical eyes and called grotesque, but were to be seen with eyes\nof faith, and to be worshipped, loved, or shuddered at. Rightly\nviewed, therefore, the poem of Dante is not grotesque, but\nunspeakably awful and solemn; and the statement is justified that\nall grotesqueness and bizarrerie in its interpretation is to be\nsedulously avoided.",
        "Therefore, while acknowledging the accuracy with which Mr.\nLongfellow has kept pace with his original through line after\nline, following the “footing of its feet,” according to the motto\nquoted on his title-page, I cannot but think that his accuracy\nwould have been of a somewhat higher kind if he had now and then\nallowed himself a little more liberty of choice between English\nand Romanic words and idioms.",
        "A few examples will perhaps serve to strengthen as well as to\nelucidate still further this position.",
        "“Inferno,” Canto III., line 22, according to Longfellow:—",
        "According to Cary:—",
        "According to Parsons:—",

        "Mr. Cary’s “bright vespertine ray” is only a trifle better; but\nMr. Wright’s “splendour of the evening ray” is, in its\nsimplicity, far preferable.",
        "Canto XXXI., line 131:—",
        "Here Mr. Longfellow has apparently followed the authority of the\nCrusca, reading",
        "and translating carribo by saraband, a kind of Moorish dance. The\nbest manuscripts, however, sanction M. Witte’s reading:—",
        "If this be correct, carribo cannot signify “a dance,” but rather\n\"the song which accompanies the dance\"; and the true sense of the\npassage will have been best rendered by Mr. Cary.[49]",
        "[49] See Blanc, Vocabolario Dantesco, s. v. “caribo.”",
        "Whenever Mr. Longfellow’s translation is kept free from oddities\nof diction and construction, it is very animated and vigorous.\nNothing can be finer than his rendering of “Purgatorio,” Canto\nVI., lines 97-117:—",
        "[50] “O Alberto Tedesco, che abbandoni\n   Costei ch’ e fatta indomita e selvaggia,\n   E dovresti inforcar li suoi arcioni,\n\n Giusto gindizio dalle stelle caggia\n   Sopra il tuo sangue, e sia nuovo ed aperto,\n   Tal che il tuo successor temenza n’ aggia:\n Cheavete tu e il tuo padre sofferto,\n   Per cupidigia di costa distretti,\n   Che il giardin dell’ imperio sia diserto.\n\n Vieni a veder Montecchi e Cappelletti,\n   Monaldi e Filippeschi, uom senza cura:\n   Color gia tristi, e questi con sospetti.\n Vien, crudel, vieni, e vedi la pressura\n   De’ tuoi gentili, e cure lor magagne,\n   E vedrai Santafior com’ e oscura [secura?].\n Vieni a veder la tua Roma che piagne,\n   Vedova e sola, e di e notte chiama:\n   Cesare mio, perche non m’ accompagne?\n Vieni a veder la gente quanto s’ ama;\n   E se nulla di noi pieta ti move,\n   A vergognar ti vien della tua fama.”",

        "So, too, Canto III., lines 79-84:—",
        "[51] “Come le pecorelle escon del chiuso\n   Ad una, a due, a tre, e l’ altre stanno\n   Timidette atterrando l’ occhio e il muso;\n\n E cio che fa la prima, e l’ altre sanno,\n   Addossandosi a lei s’ ella s’ arresta,\n   Semplici e quete, e lo ’mperche non sanno.”",
        "Francesca’s exclamation to Dante is thus rendered by Mr.\nLongfellow:—",
        "[52] “Ed ella a me: Nessun maggior dolore\n Che ricordarsi del tempo felice Nella miseria.\"\nInferno, V. 121-123.",
        "This is admirable,—full of the true poetic glow, which would\nhave been utterly quenched if some Romanic equivalent of dolore\nhad been used instead of our good Saxon sorrow.[53] So, too, the\n\"Paradiso,” Canto I., line 100:—",
        "[53] Yet admirable as it is, I am not quite sure that Dr.\nParsons, by taking further liberty with the original, has not\nsurpassed it:—\n  “And she to me: The mightiest of all woes\n   Is in the midst of misery to be cursed\n   With bliss remembered.”\n\n[54] “Ond’ ella, appresso d’un pio sospiro\n, Gli occhi drizzo ver me con quel sembiante,\n Che madre fa sopra figlinol deliro.”",
        "And, finally, the beginning of the eighth canto of the\n\"Purgatorio”:—",
        "[55] “Era gia l’ ora che volge il disio\n   Ai naviganti, e intenerisce il core\n   Lo di ch’ hen detto ai dolci amici addio;\n E che lo nuovo peregrin d’ amore\n   Punge, se ode squilla di lontano,\n   Che paia il giorno pianger che si more.”",
        "This passage affords an excellent example of what the method of\nliteral translation can do at its best. Except in the second\nline, where “those who sail the sea” is wisely preferred to any\nRomanic equivalent of naviganti the version is utterly literal;\nas literal as the one the school-boy makes, when he opens his\nVirgil at the Fourth Eclogue, and lumberingly reads, “Sicilian\nMuses, let us sing things a little greater.” But there is nothing\nclumsy, nothing which smacks of the recitation-room, in these\nlines of Mr. Longfellow. For easy grace and exquisite beauty it\nwould be difficult to surpass them. They may well bear comparison\nwith the beautiful lines into which Lord Byron has rendered the\nsame thought:—",
        "[56] Don Juan, III. 108.",
        "Setting aside the concluding sentimental generalization,—which\nis much more Byronic than Dantesque,—one hardly knows which\nversion to call more truly poetical; but for a faithful rendering\nof the original conception one can hardly hesitate to give the\npalm to Mr. Longfellow.",
        "Thus we see what may be achieved by the most highly gifted of\ntranslators who contents himself with passively reproducing the\ndiction of his original, who constitutes himself, as it were, a\nconduit through which the meaning of the original may flow. Where\nthe differences inherent in the languages employed do not\nintervene to alloy the result, the stream of the original may, as\nin the verses just cited, come out pure and unweakened. Too\noften, however, such is the subtle chemistry of thought, it will\ncome out diminished in its integrity, or will appear, bereft of\nits primitive properties as a mere element in some new\ncombination. Our channel is a trifle too alkaline perhaps; and\nthat the transferred material may preserve its pleasant\nsharpness, we may need to throw in a little extra acid. Too often\nthe mere differences between English and Italian prevent Dante’s\nexpressions from coming out in Mr. Longfellow’s version so pure\nand unimpaired as in the instance just cited. But these\ndifferences cannot be ignored. They lie deep in the very\nstructure of human speech, and are narrowly implicated with\nequally profound nuances in the composition of human thought. The\ncauses which make dolente a solemn word to the Italian ear, and\ndolent a queer word to the English ear, are causes which have\nbeen slowly operating ever since the Italican and the Teuton\nparted company on their way from Central Asia. They have brought\nabout a state of things which no cunning of the translator can\nessentially alter, but to the emergencies of which he must\ngraciously conform his proceedings. Here, then, is the sole point\non which we disagree with Mr. Longfellow, the sole reason we have\nfor thinking that he has not attained the fullest possible\nmeasure of success. Not that he has made a “realistic\"\ntranslation,—so far we conceive him to be entirely right; but\nthat, by dint of pushing sheer literalism beyond its proper\nlimits, he has too often failed to be truly realistic. Let us\nhere explain what is meant by realistic translation.",
        "Every thoroughly conceived and adequately executed translation of\nan ancient author must be founded upon some conscious theory or\nsome unconscious instinct of literary criticism. As is the\ncritical spirit of an age, so among other things will be its\ntranslations. Now the critical spirit of every age previous to\nour own has been characterized by its inability to appreciate\nsympathetically the spirit of past and bygone times. In the\nseventeenth century criticism made idols of its ancient models;\nit acknowledged no serious imperfections in them; it set them up\nas exemplars for the present and all future times to copy. Let\nthe genial Epicurean henceforth write like Horace, let the epic\nnarrator imitate the supreme elegance of Virgil,—that was the\nconspicuous idea, the conspicuous error, of seventeenth-century\ncriticism. It overlooked the differences between one age and\nanother. Conversely, when it brought Roman patricians and Greek\noligarchs on to the stage, it made them behave like French\ncourtiers or Castilian grandees or English peers. When it had to\ndeal with ancient heroes, it clothed them in the garb and imputed\nto them the sentiments of knights-errant. Then came the\nrevolutionary criticism of the eighteenth century, which assumed\nthat everything old was wrong, while everything new was right. It\nrecognized crudely the differences between one age and another,\nbut it had a way of looking down upon all ages except the\npresent. This intolerance shown toward the past was indeed a\nmeasure of the crudeness with which it was comprehended. Because\nMohammed, if he had done what he did, in France and in the\neighteenth century, would have been called an impostor, Voltaire,\nthe great mouthpiece and representative of this style of\ncriticism, portrays him as an impostor. Recognition of the fact\nthat different ages are different, together with inability to\nperceive that they ought to be different, that their differences\nlie in the nature of progress,—this was the prominent\ncharacteristic of eighteenth-century criticism. Of all the great\nmen of that century, Lessing was perhaps the only one who outgrew\nthis narrow critical habit.",
        "Now nineteenth-century criticism not only knows that in no\npreceding age have men thought and behaved as they now think and\nbehave, but it also understands that old-fashioned thinking and\nbehaviour was in its way just as natural and sensible as that\nwhich is now new-fashioned. It does not flippantly sneer at an\nancient custom because we no longer cherish it; but with an\nenlightened regard for everything human, it inquires into its\norigin, traces its effects, and endeavours to explain its decay.\nIt is slow to characterize Mohammed as an impostor, because it\nhas come to feel that Arabia in the seventh century is one thing\nand Europe in the nineteenth another. It is scrupulous about\nbranding Caesar as an usurper, because it has discovered that\nwhat Mr. Mill calls republican liberty and what Cicero called\nrepublican liberty are widely different notions. It does not tell\nus to bow down before Lucretius and Virgil as unapproachable\nmodels, while lamenting our own hopeless inferiority; nor does it\ntell us to set them down as half-skilled apprentices, while\ncongratulating ourselves on our own comfortable superiority; but\nit tells us to study them as the exponents of an age forever\ngone, from which we have still many lessons to learn, though we\nno longer think as it thought or feel as it felt. The eighteenth\ncentury, as represented by the characteristic passage from\nVoltaire, cited by Mr. Longfellow, failed utterly to understand\nDante. To the minds of Voltaire and his contemporaries the great\nmediaeval poet was little else than a Titanic monstrosity,—a\nmaniac, whose ravings found rhythmical expression; his poem a\ngrotesque medley, wherein a few beautiful verses were buried\nunder the weight of whole cantos of nonsensical scholastic\nquibbling. This view, somewhat softened, we find also in Leigh\nHunt, whose whole account of Dante is an excellent specimen of\nthis sort of criticism. Mr. Hunt’s fine moral nature was shocked\nand horrified by the terrible punishments described in the\n\"Inferno.” He did not duly consider that in Dante’s time these\nfearful things were an indispensable part of every man’s theory\nof the world; and, blinded by his kindly prejudices, he does not\nseem to have perceived that Dante, in accepting eternal torments\nas part and parcel of the system of nature, was nevertheless, in\ndescribing them, inspired with that ineffable tenderness of pity\nwhich, in the episodes of Francesca and of Brunetto Latini, has\nmelted the hearts of men in past times, and will continue to do\nso in times to come. “Infinite pity, yet infinite rigour of law!\nIt is so Nature is made: it is so Dante discerned that she was\nmade.\"[57] This remark of the great seer of our time is what the\neighteenth century could in no wise comprehend. The men of that\nday failed to appreciate Dante, just as they were oppressed or\ndisgusted at the sight of Gothic architecture; just as they\npronounced the scholastic philosophy an unmeaning jargon; just as\nthey considered mediaeval Christianity a gigantic system of\ncharlatanry, and were wont unreservedly to characterize the\nPapacy as a blighting despotism. In our time cultivated men think\ndifferently. We have learned that the interminable hair-splitting\nof Aquinas and Abelard has added precision to modern\nthinking.[58] We do not curse Gregory VII. and Innocent III. as\nenemies of the human race, but revere them as benefactors. We can\nspare a morsel of hearty admiration for Becket, however strongly\nwe may sympathize with the stalwart king who did penance for his\nfoul murder; and we can appreciate Dante’s poor opinion of Philip\nthe Fair no less than his denunciation of Boniface VIII. The\ncontemplation of Gothic architecture, as we stand entranced in\nthe sublime cathedrals of York or Rouen, awakens in our breasts a\ngenuine response to the mighty aspirations which thus became\nincarnate in enduring stone. And the poem of Dante—which has\nbeen well likened to a great cathedral—we reverently accept,\nwith all its quaint carvings and hieroglyphic symbols, as the\nauthentic utterance of feelings which still exist, though they no\nlonger choose the same form of expression.",
        "[57] Carlyle, Heroes and Hero-Worship, p. 84.\n\n[58] See my Outlines of Cosmic Philosophy, Vol. I. p. 123.",
        "A century ago, therefore, a translation of Dante such as Mr.\nLongfellow’s would have been impossible. The criticism of that\ntime was in no mood for realistic reproductions of the antique.\nIt either superciliously neglected the antique, or else dressed\nit up to suit its own notions of propriety. It was not like a\nseven-league boot which could fit everybody, but it was like a\nProcrustes-bed which everybody must be made to fit. Its great\nexponent was not a Sainte-Beuve, but a Boileau. Its typical\nsample of a reproduction of the antique was Pope’s translation of\nthe Iliad. That book, we presume, everybody has read; and many of\nthose who have read it know that, though an excellent and\nspirited poem, it is no more Homer than the age of Queen Anne was\nthe age of Peisistratos. Of the translations of Dante made during\nthis period, the chief was unquestionably Mr. Cary’s.[59] For a\nman born and brought up in the most unpoetical of centuries, Mr.\nCary certainly made a very good poem, though not so good as\nPope’s. But it fell far short of being a reproduction of Dante.\nThe eighteenth-century note rings out loudly on every page of it.\nLike much other poetry of the time, it is laboured and\nartificial. Its sentences are often involved and occasionally\nobscure. Take, for instance, Canto IV. 25-36 of the “Paradiso”:",
        "[59] This work comes at the end of the eighteenth-century period,\nas Pope’s translation of Homer comes at the beginning.",
        "Here Mr. Cary not only fails to catch Dante’s grand style; he\ndoes not even write a style at all. It is too constrained and\nawkward to be dignified, and dignity is an indispensable element\nof style. Without dignity we may write clearly, or nervously, or\nracily, but we have not attained to a style. This is the second\nshortcoming of Mr. Cary’s translation. Like Pope’s, it fails to\ncatch the grand style of its original. Unlike Pope’s, it\nfrequently fails to exhibit any style.",
        "It is hardly necessary to spend much time in proving that Mr.\nLongfellow’s version is far superior to Mr. Cary’s. It is usually\neasy and flowing, and save in the occasional use of violent\ninversions, always dignified. Sometimes, as in the episode of\nUgolino, it even rises to something like the grandeur of the\noriginal:",
        "[60] “Quand’ ebbe detto cio, eon gli occhi torti\n Riprese il teschio misero coi denti,\n Che furo all’ osso, come d’un can, forti.\"\n  Inferno, XXXIII. 76.",
        "That is in the grand style, and so is the following, which\ndescribes those sinners locked in the frozen lake below\nMalebolge:—",
        "[61] “Lo pianto stesso li pianger non lascia,\n E il duol, che trova in sugli occhi rintoppo,\n Si volve in entro a far crescer l’ ambascia.\"\n Inferno, XXXIII. 94.",
        "And the exclamation of one of these poor “wretches of the frozen\ncrust” is an exclamation that Shakespeare might have written:—",
        "[62] “Levatemi dal viso i duri veli,\n Si ch’ io sfoghi il dolor che il cor m’ impregna.\"\n        Ib. 112.",
        "There is nothing in Mr. Cary’s translation which can stand a\ncomparison with that. The eighteenth century could not translate\nlike that. For here at last we have a real reproduction of the\nantique. In the Shakespearian ring of these lines we recognize\nthe authentic rendering of the tones of the only man since the\nChristian era who could speak like Shakespeare.",
        "In this way Mr. Longfellow’s translation is, to an eminent\ndegree, realistic. It is a work conceived and executed in entire\naccordance with the spirit of our time. Mr. Longfellow has set\nabout making a reconstructive translation, and he has succeeded\nin the attempt. In view of what he has done, no one can ever wish\nto see the old methods of Pope and Cary again resorted to. It is\nonly where he fails to be truly realistic that he comes short of\nsuccess. And, as already hinted, it is oftenest through sheer\nexcess of LITERALISM that he ceases to be realistic, and departs\nfrom the spirit of his author instead of coming nearer to it. In\nthe “Paradiso,” Canto X. 1-6, his method leads him into\nawkwardness:—",
        "This seems clumsy and halting, yet it is an extremely literal\nparaphrase of a graceful and flowing original:—",
        "Now to turn a graceful and flowing sentence into one that is\nclumsy and halting is certainly not to reproduce it, no matter\nhow exactly the separate words are rendered, or how closely the\nsyntactic constructions match each other. And this consideration\nseems conclusive as against the adequacy of the literalist\nmethod. That method is inadequate, not because it is too\nREALISTIC, but because it runs continual risk of being too\nVERBALISTIC.

        "Good taste and poetic genius are, however, better than the best\nof rules, and so, after all said and done, we can only conclude\nthat Mr. Longfellow has given us a great and noble work not\nlikely soon to be equalled. Leopardi somewhere, in speaking of\nthe early Italian translators of the classics and their\nwell-earned popularity, says, who knows but Caro will live in\nmen’s remembrance as long as Virgil? “La belie destinee,” adds\nSainte-Beuve, “de ne pouvoir plus mourir, sinon avec un\nimmortel!” Apart from Mr. Longfellow’s other titles to undying\nfame, such a destiny is surely marked out for him, and throughout\nthe English portions of the world his name will always be\nassociated with that of the great Florentine.",
        "  June, 1867.",
        "For music-lovers in America the great event of the season has\nbeen the performance of Mr. Paine’s oratorio, “St. Peter,” at\nPortland, June 3. This event is important, not only as the first\nappearance of an American oratorio, but also as the first direct\nproof we have had of the existence of creative musical genius in\nthis country. For Mr. Paine’s Mass in D—a work which was brought\nout with great success several years ago in Berlin—has, for some\nreason or other, never been performed here. And, with the\nexception of Mr. Paine, we know of no American hitherto who has\nshown either the genius or the culture requisite for writing\nmusic in the grand style, although there is some of the\nKapellmeister music, written by our leading organists and\nchoristers, which deserves honourable mention. Concerning the\nrank likely to be assigned by posterity to “St. Peter,” it would\nbe foolish now to speculate; and it would be equally unwise to\nbring it into direct comparison with masterpieces like the\n\"Messiah,” “Elijah,” and “St. Paul,” the greatness of which has\nbeen so long acknowledged. Longer familiarity with the work is\nneeded before such comparisons, always of somewhat doubtful\nvalue, can be profitably undertaken. But it must at least be\nsaid, as the net result of our impressions derived both from\nprevious study of the score and from hearing, the performance at\nPortland, that Mr. Paine’s oratorio has fairly earned for itself\nthe right to be judged by the same high standard which we apply\nto these noble works of Mendelssohn and Handel.",
        "In our limited space we can give only the briefest description of\nthe general structure of the work. The founding of Christianity,\nas illustrated in four principal scenes of the life of St. Peter,\nsupplies the material for the dramatic development of the\nsubject. The overture, beginning with an adagio movement in\nB-flat minor, gives expression to the vague yearnings of that\ntime of doubt and hesitancy when the “oracles were dumb,” and the\ndawning of a new era of stronger and diviner faith was matter of\npresentiment rather than of definite hope or expectation. Though\nthe tonality is at first firmly established, yet as the movement\nbecomes more agitated, the final tendency of the modulations also\nbecomes uncertain, and for a few bars it would seem as if the key\nof F-sharp minor might be the point of destination. But after a\nshort melody by the wind instruments, accompanied by a rapid\nupward movement of strings, the dominant chord of C major asserts\nitself, being repeated, with sundry inversions, through a dozen\nbars, and leading directly into the triumphant and majestic\nchorus, “ The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of heaven is at\nhand.” The second subject, introduced by the word “repent\"\ndescending through the interval of a diminished seventh and\ncontrasted with the florid counterpoint of the phrase, “and\nbelieve the glad tidings of God,” is a masterpiece of\ncontrapuntal writing, and, if performed by a choir of three or\nfour hundred voices, would produce an overpowering effect. The\ndivine call of Simon Peter and his brethren is next described in\na tenor recitative; and the acceptance of the glad tidings is\nexpressed in an aria, “The spirit of the Lord is upon me,” which,\nby an original but appropriate conception, is given to the\nsoprano voice. In the next number, the disciples are dramatically\nrepresented by twelve basses and tenors, singing in four-part\nharmony, and alternating or combining with the full chorus in\ndescription of the aims of the new religion. The poem ends with\nthe choral, “How lovely shines the Morning Star!” Then follows\nthe sublime scene from Matthew xvi. 14-18, where Peter declares\nhis master to be “the Christ, the Son of the living God,\"—one of\nthe most impressive scenes, we have always thought, in the gospel\nhistory, and here not inadequately treated. The feeling of\nmysterious and awful grandeur awakened by Peter’s bold\nexclamation, “Thou art the Christ,” is powerfully rendered by the\nentrance of the trombones upon the inverted subdominant triad of\nC-sharp minor, and their pause upon the dominant of the same key.\nThroughout this scene the characteristic contrast between the\nardent vigour of Peter and the sweet serenity of Jesus is well\ndelineated in the music. After Peter’s stirring aria, “My heart\nis glad,” the dramatic climax is reached in the C-major chorus,\n\"The Church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and\nprophets.”",
        "The second scene is carried out to somewhat greater length,\ncorresponding nearly to the last half of the first part of\n\"Elijah,” from the point where the challenge is given to the\nprophets of Baal. In the opening passages of mingled recitative\nand arioso, Peter is forewarned that he shall deny his Master,\nand his half-indignant remonstrance is sustained, with added\nemphasis, by the voices of the twelve disciples, pitched a fourth\nhigher. Then Judas comes, with a great multitude, and Jesus is\ncarried before the high-priest. The beautiful F-minor chorus, “We\nhid our faces from him,” furnishes the musical comment upon the\nstatement that “the disciples all forsook him and fled.” We\nhardly dare to give full expression to our feelings about this\nchorus (which during the past month has been continually singing\nitself over and over again in our recollection), lest it should\nbe supposed that our enthusiasm has got the better of our sober\njudgment. The second theme, “He was brought as a lamb to the\nslaughter, yet he opened not his mouth,” is quite Handel-like in\nthe simplicity and massiveness of its magnificent harmonic\nprogressions. With the scene of the denial, for which we are thus\nprepared, the dramatic movement becomes exceedingly rapid, and\nthe rendering of the events in the high-priest’s hall—Peter’s\nbass recitative alternating its craven protestations with the\nclamorous agitato chorus of the servants—is stirring in the\nextreme. The contralto aria describing the Lord’s turning and\nlooking upon Peter is followed by the orchestra with a lament in\nB-flat minor, introducing the bass aria of the repentant and\nremorse-stricken disciple, “O God, my God, forsake me not.” As\nthe last strains of the lamentation die away, a choir of angels\nis heard, of sopranos and contraltos divided, singing, “Remember\nfrom whence thou art fallen,” to an accompaniment of harps. The\nsecond theme, “He that overcometh shall receive a crown of life,\"\nis introduced in full chorus, in a cheering allegro movement,\npreparing the way for a climax higher than any yet reached in the\ncourse of the work. This climax—delayed for a few moments by an\nandante aria for a contralto voice, “The Lord is faithful and\nrighteous\"—at last bursts upon us with a superb crescendo of\nstrings, and the words, “Awake, thou that sleepest, arise from\nthe dead, and Christ shall give thee light.” This chorus, which\nfor reasons presently to be given was heard at considerable\ndisadvantage at Portland, contains some of the best fugue-writing\nin the work, and is especially rich and powerful in its\ninstrumentation.",
        "The second part of the oratorio begins with the crucifixion and\nascension of Jesus. Here we must note especially the deeply\npathetic opening chorus, “The Son of Man was delivered into the\nhands of sinful men,” the joyous allegro, “And on the third day\nhe rose again,” the choral, “Jesus, my Redeemer, lives,” and the\nquartet, “Feed the flock of God,” commenting upon the command of\nJesus, “Feed my lambs.” This quartet has all the heavenly\nsweetness of Handel’s “He shall feed his flock,” which it\nsuggests by similarity of subject, though not by similarity of\ntreatment; but in a certain quality of inwardness, or religious\nmeditativeness, it reminds one more of Mr. Paine’s favourite\nmaster, Bach. The choral, like the one in the first part and the\none which follows the scene of Pentecost, is taken from the\nLutheran Choral Book, and arranged with original harmony and\ninstrumentation, in accordance with the custom of Bach,\nMendelssohn, and other composers, “of introducing into their\nsacred compositions the old popular choral melodies which are the\npeculiar offspring of a religious age.” Thus the noblest choral\never written, the “Sleepers, wake,” in “St. Paul,” was composed\nin 1604 by Praetorius, the harmonization and accompaniment only\nbeing the work of Mendelssohn.",
        "In “St. Peter,” as in “Elijah,” the second part, while forming\nthe true musical climax of the oratorio, admits of a briefer\ndescription than the first part. The wave of emotion answering to\nthe sensuously dramatic element having partly spent itself, the\nwave of lyric emotion gathers fresh strength, and one feels that\none has reached the height of spiritual exaltation, while,\nnevertheless, there is not so much which one can describe to\nothers who may not happen to have gone through with the same\nexperience. Something of the same feeling one gets in studying\nDante’s “Paradiso,” after finishing the preceding divisions of\nhis poem: there is less which can be pictured to the eye of\nsense, or left to be supplied by the concrete imagination.\nNevertheless, in the scene of Pentecost, which follows that of\nthe Ascension, there is no lack of dramatic vividness. Indeed,\nthere is nothing in the work more striking than the orchestration\nof the introductory tenor recitative, the mysterious chorus, “The\nvoice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire,” or the amazed\nquery which follows, “Behold, are not all these who speak\nGalileans? and how is it that we every one hear them in our own\ntongue wherein we were born?” We have heard the opinion expressed\nthat Mr. Paine’s oratorio must be lacking in originality, since\nit suggests such strong reminiscences of “St. Paul.” Now, this\nsuggestion, it seems to us, is due partly to the similarity of\nthe subjects, independently of any likeness in the modes of\ntreatment, and partly, perhaps, to the fact that Mr. Paine, as\nwell as Mendelssohn, has been a devoted student of Bach, whose\ncharacteristics are so strong that they may well have left their\nmark upon the works of both composers. But especially it would\nseem that there is some real, though very general resemblance\nbetween this colloquial chorus, “Behold,” etc., and some choruses\nin “St. Paul,” as, for example Nos. 29 and 36-38. In the same way\nthe scene in the high-priest’s hall might distantly suggest\neither of these passages, or others in “Elijah;” These\nresemblances, however, are very superficial, pertaining not to\nthe musical but to the dramatic treatment of situations which are\ngenerically similar in so far, and only in so far, as they\nrepresent conversational passages between an apostle or prophet\nand an ignorant multitude, whether amazed or hostile, under the\nsway of violent excitement. As regards the musical elaboration of\nthese terse and striking alternations of chorus and recitative,\nits originality can be questioned only after we have decided to\nrefer all originality on such matters to Bach, or, indeed, even\nbehind him, into the Middle Ages.",
        "After the preaching of Peter, and the sweet contralto aria, “As\nfor man, his days are as grass,” the culmination of this scene\ncomes in the D-major chorus, “This is the witness of God.” What\nfollows, beginning with the choral, “Praise to the Father,” is to\nbe regarded as an epilogue or peroration to the whole work. It is\nin accordance with a sound tradition that the grand sacred drama\nof an oratorio should conclude with a lyric outburst of\nthanksgiving, a psalm of praise to the Giver of every good and\nperfect gift. Thus, after Peter’s labours are ended in the aria,\n\"Now as ye were redeemed,” in which the twelve disciples and the\nfull chorus join, a duet for tenor and soprano, “Sing unto God,\"\nbrings us to the grand final chorus in C major, “Great and\nmarvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty.”",
        "The cadence of this concluding chorus reminds us that one of the\nnoteworthy points in the oratorio is the character of its\ncadences. The cadence prepared by the 6/4 chord, now become so\nhackneyed from its perpetual and wearisome repetition in popular\nchurch music, seems to be especially disliked by Mr. Paine, as it\noccurs but once or twice in the course of the work. In the great\nchoruses the cadence is usually reached either by a pedal on the\ntonic, as in the chorus, “Awake, thou that sleepest,” or by a\npedal on the dominant culminating in a chord of the major ninth,\nas in the final chorus; or there is a plagal cadence, as in the\nfirst chorus of the second part; or, if the 6/4 chord is\nintroduced, as it is in the chorus, “He that overcometh,” its\nordinary effect is covered and obscured by the movement of the\ndivided sopranos. We do not remember noticing anywhere such a\ndecided use of the 6/4 chord as is made, for example, by\nMendelssohn, in “Thanks be to God,” or in the final chorus of\n\"St. Paul.” Perhaps if we were to confess our lingering fondness\nfor the cadence prepared by the 6/4 chord, when not too\nfrequently introduced, it might only show that we retain a liking\nfor New England “psalm-tunes\"; but it does seem to us that a\nsense of final repose, of entire cessation of movement, is more\neffectually secured by this cadence than by any other. Yet while\nthe 6/4 cadence most completely expresses finality and rest, it\nwould seem that the plagal and other cadences above enumerated as\npreferred by Mr. Paine have a certain sort of superiority by\nreason of the very incompleteness with which they express\nfinality. There is no sense of finality whatever about the\nPhrygian cadence; it leaves the mind occupied with the feeling of\na boundless region beyond, into which one would fain penetrate;\nand for this reason it has, in sacred music, a great value.\nSomething of the same feeling, too, attaches to those cadences in\nwhich an unexpected major third usurps the place of the minor\nwhich the ear was expecting, as in the “Incarnatus” of Mozart’s\n\"Twelfth Mass,” or in Bach’s sublime “Prelude,” Part I., No. 22\nof the “Well-tempered Clavichord.” In a less degree, an analogous\neffect was produced upon us by the cadence with a pedal on the\ntonic in the choruses, “The Church is built,” and “Awake, thou\nthat sleepest.” On these considerations it may become\nintelligible that to some hearers Mr. Paine’s cadences have\nseemed unsatisfactory, their ears having missed the positive\ncategorical assertion of finality which the 6/4 cadence alone can\ngive. To go further into this subject would take us far beyond\nour limits.",
        "The pleasant little town of Portland has reason to congratulate\nitself, first, on being the birthplace of such a composer as Mr.\nPaine; secondly, on having been the place where the first great\nwork of America in the domain of music was brought out; and\nthirdly, on possessing what is probably the most thoroughly\ndisciplined choral society in this country. Our New York friends,\nafter their recent experiences, will perhaps be slow to believe\nus when we say that the Portland choir sang this new work even\nbetter, in many respects, than the Handel and Haydn Society sing\nthe old and familiar “Elijah\"; but it is true. In their command\nof the pianissimo and the gradual crescendo, and in the precision\nof their attack, the Portland singers can easily teach the Handel\nand Haydn a quarter’s lessons. And, besides all this, they know\nhow to preserve their equanimity under the gravest persecutions\nof the orchestra; keeping the even tenour of their way where a\nless disciplined choir, incited by the excessive blare of the\ntrombones and the undue scraping of the second violins, would be\nlikely to lose its presence of mind and break out into an\nuntimely fortissimo.",
        "No doubt it is easier to achieve perfect chorus-singing with a\nchoir of one hundred and twenty-five voices than with a choir of\nsix hundred. But this diminutive size, which was an advantage so\nfar as concerned the technical excellence of the Portland choir,\nwas decidedly a disadvantage so far as concerned the proper\nrendering of the more massive choruses in “St. Peter.” All the\ngreatest choruses—such as Nos. 1, 8, 19, 20, 28, 35, and\n39—were seriously impaired in the rendering by the lack of\nmassiveness in the voices. For example, the grand chorus, “Awake,\nthou that sleepest,” begins with a rapid crescendo of strings,\nintroducing the full chorus on the word “Awake,” upon the\ndominant triad of D major; and after a couple of beats the voices\nare reinforced by the trombones, producing the most tremendous\neffect possible in such a crescendo. Unfortunately, however, the\nbrass asserted itself at this point so much more emphatically\nthan the voices that the effect was almost to disjoin the latter\nportion of the chord from its beginning, and thus to dwarf the\nutterance of the word “Awake.” To us this effect was very\ndisagreeable; and it was obviously contrary to the effect\nintended by the composer. But with a weight of four or five\nhundred voices, the effect would be entirely different. Instead\nof entering upon the scene as intruders, the mighty trombones\nwould only serve to swell and enrich the ponderous chord which\nopens this noble chorus. Given greater weight only, and the\nperformance of the admirable Portland choir would have left\nnothing to be desired.",
        "We cannot speak with so much satisfaction of the performance of\nthe orchestra. The instrumentation of “St. Peter” is remarkably\nfine. But this instrumentation was rather clumsily rendered by\nthe orchestra, whose doings constituted the least enjoyable part\nof the performance. There was too much blare of brass, whine of\nhautboy, and scraping of strings. But in condonation of this\nserious defect, one must admit that the requisite amount of\nrehearsal is out of the question when one’s choir is in Portland\nand one’s orchestra in Boston; besides which the parts had been\ninaccurately copied. For a moment, at the beginning of the\norchestral lament, there was risk of disaster, the wind\ninstruments failing to come in at the right time, when Mr. Paine,\nwith fortunate presence of mind, stopped the players, and the\nmovement was begun over again,—the whole occurring so quickly\nand quietly as hardly to attract attention.",
        "In conclusion we would say a few words suggested by a recent\ncritical notice of Mr. Paine’s work in the “Nation.” While\nacknowledging the importance of the publication of this oratorio,\nas an event in the art-history of America, the writer betrays\nmanifest disappointment that this work should not rather have\nbeen a symphony,[63] and thus have belonged to what he calls the\n\"domain of absolute music.” Now with regard to the assumption\nthat the oratorio is not so high a form of music as the symphony,\nor, in other words, that vocal music in general is artistically\ninferior to instrumental music, we may observe, first, that\nAmbros and Dommer—two of the most profound musical critics now\nliving—do not sustain it. It is Beanquier, we think, who\nsuggests that instrumental music should rank above vocal, because\nit is “pure music,” bereft of the fictitious aids of language and\nof the emotional associations which are grouped about the\npeculiar timbre of the human voice.[64] At first the suggestion\nseems plausible; but on analogous grounds we might set the piano\nabove the orchestra, because the piano gives us pure harmony and\ncounterpoint, without the adventitious aid of variety in timbre.\nAnd it is indeed true that, for some such reason as this,\nmusicians delight in piano-sonatas, which are above all things\ntedious and unintelligible to the mind untrained in music.\nNevertheless, in spite of its great and peculiar prerogatives, it\nwould be absurd to prefer the piano to the orchestra; and there\nis a kindred absurdity involved in setting the orchestra above\nthat mighty union of orchestra, organ, and voices which we get in\nthe oratorio. When the reason alleged for ranking the symphony\nabove the oratorio leads us likewise to rank the sonata above the\nsymphony, we seem to have reached a reductio ad absurdum.",
        "[63] Now within two years, Mr. Paine’s C-minor symphony has\nfollowed the completion of his oratorio.\n\n[64] These peculiar associations are no doubt what is chiefly\nenjoyed in music, antecedent to a properly musical culture.\nPersons of slight acquaintance with music invariably prefer the\nvoice to the piano.",
        "Rightly considered, the question between vocal and instrumental\nmusic amounts to this, What does music express? This is a great\npsychological question, and we have not now the space or the\nleisure requisite for discussing it, even in the most summary\nway. We will say, however, that we do not see how music can in\nany way express ideas, or anything but moods or emotional states\nto which the ideas given in language may add determination and\nprecision. The pure symphony gives utterance to moods, and will\nbe a satisfactory work of art or not, according as the composer\nhas been actuated by a legitimate sequence of emotional states,\nlike Beethoven, or by a desire to produce novel and startling\neffects, like Liszt. But the danger in purely instrumental music\nis that it may run riot in the extravagant utterance of emotional\nstates which are not properly concatenated by any normal sequence\nof ideas associated with them. This is sometimes exemplified in\nthe most modern instrumental music.",
        "Now, as in real life our sequent clusters of emotional states are\nin general determined by their association with our sequent\ngroups of intellectual ideas, it would seem that music, regarded\nas an exponent of psychical life, reaches its fullest\nexpressiveness when the sequence of the moods which it incarnates\nin sound is determined by some sequence of ideas, such as is\nfurnished by the words of a libretto. Not that the words should\nhave predominance over the music, or even coequal sway with it,\nbut that they should serve to give direction to the succession of\nfeelings expressed by the music. “Lift up your heads” and\n\"Hallelujah” do not owe their glory to the text, but to that\ntremendous energy of rhythmic and contrapuntal progression which\nthe text serves to concentrate and justify. When precision and\ndefiniteness of direction are thus added to the powerful physical\nmeans of expression which we get in the combination of chorus,\norchestra, and organ, we have attained the greatest sureness as\nwell as the greatest wealth of musical expressiveness. And thus\nwe may see the reasonableness of Dommer’s opinion that in order\nto restrain instrumental music from ruining itself by meaningless\nextravagance, it is desirable that there should be a renaissance\nof vocal music, such as it was in the golden age of Palestrina\nand Orlando Lasso.",
        "We are not inclined to deny that in structural beauty—in the\nsymmetrical disposition and elaboration of musical themes—the\nsymphony has the advantage. The words, which in the oratorio\nserve to give definite direction to the currents of emotion, may\nalso sometimes hamper the free development of the pure musical\nconception, just as in psychical life the obtrusive entrance of\nideas linked by association may hinder the full fruition of some\nemotional state. Nevertheless, in spite of this possible\ndrawback, it may be doubted if the higher forms of polyphonic\ncomposition fall so very far short of the symphony in capability\nof giving full elaboration to the musical idea. The practical\ntestimony of Beethoven, in his Ninth Symphony, is decidedly\nadverse to any such supposition.",
        "But to pursue this interesting question would carry us far beyond\nour limits. Whatever may be the decision as to the respective\nclaims of vocal and instrumental music, we have every reason for\nwelcoming the appearance, in our own country, of an original work\nin the highest form of vocal music. It is to be hoped that we\nshall often have the opportunity to “hear with our ears” this\ninteresting work; for as a rule great musical compositions are\npeculiarly unfortunate among works of art, in being known at\nfirst hand by comparatively few persons. In this way is rendered\npossible that pretentious kind of dilettante criticism which is\nso common in musical matters, and which is often positively\ninjurious, as substituting a factitious public opinion for one\nthat is genuine. We hope that the favour with which the new\noratorio has already been received will encourage the author to\npursue the enviable career upon which he has entered. Even\nrestricting ourselves to vocal music, there is still a broad\nfield left open for original work. The secular cantata—attempted\nin recent times by Schumann, as well as by English composers of\nsmaller calibre—is a very high form of vocal music; and if\nfounded on an adequate libretto, dealing with some supremely\ngrand or tragical situation, is capable of being carried to an\nunprecedented height of musical elaboration. Here is an\nopportunity for original achievement, of which it is to be hoped\nthat some gifted and well-trained composer, like the author of\n\"St. Peter,” may find it worth while to avail himself.",

        "We are glad of a chance to introduce to our readers one of the\nworks of a great writer. Though not yet[66] widely known in this\ncountry, M. Taine has obtained a very high reputation in Europe.\nHe is still quite a young man, but is nevertheless the author of\nnineteen goodly volumes, witty, acute, and learned; and already\nhe is often ranked with Renan, Littre, and Sainte-Beuve, the\ngreatest living French writers.",
        "[66] That is, in 1868.",
        "Hippolyte Adolphe Taine was born at Vouziers, among the grand\nforests of Ardennes, in 1828, and is therefore about forty years\nold. His family was simple in habits and tastes, and entertained\na steadfast belief in culture, along with the possession of a\nfair amount of it. His grandfather was sub-prefect at Rocroi, in\n1814 and 1815, under the first restoration of the Bourbons. His\nfather, a lawyer by profession, was the first instructor of his\nson, and taught him Latin, and from an uncle, who had been in\nAmerica, he learned English, while still a mere child. Having\ngone to Paris with his mother in 1842, he began his studies at\nthe College Bourbon and in 1848 was promoted to the ecole\nNormale. Weiss, About, and Prevost-Paradol were his\ncontemporaries at this institution. At that time great liberty\nwas enjoyed in regard to the order and the details of the\nexercises; so that Taine, with his surprising rapidity, would do\nin one week the work laid out for a month, and would spend the\nremainder of the time in private reading. In 1851 he left\ncollege, and after two or three unsatisfactory attempts at\nteaching, in Paris and in the provinces, he settled down at Paris\nas a private student. He gave himself the very best elementary\npreparation which a literary man can have,—a thorough course in\nmathematics and the physical sciences. His studies in anatomy and\nphysiology were especially elaborate and minute. He attended the\nSchool of Medicine as regularly as if he expected to make his\ndaily bread in the profession. In this way, when at the age of\ntwenty-five he began to write books, M. Taine was a really\neducated man; and his books show it. The day is past when a man\ncould write securely, with a knowledge of the classics alone. We\ndoubt if a philosophical critic is perfectly educated for his\ntask, unless he can read, for instance, Donaldson’s “New\nCratylus” on the one hand, and Rokitansky’s “Pathological\nAnatomy” on the other, for the sheer pleasure of the thing. At\nany rate, it was an education of this sort which M. Taine, at the\noutset of his literary career, had secured. By this solid\ndiscipline of mathematics, chemistry, and medicine, M. Taine\nbecame that which above all things he now is,—a man possessed of\na central philosophy, of an exact, categorical, well-defined\nsystem, which accompanies and supports him in his most distant\nliterary excursions. He does not keep throwing out ideas at\nrandom, like too many literary critics, but attaches all his\ncriticisms to a common fundamental principle; in short, he is not\na dilettante, but a savant.",
        "His treatise on La Fontaine, in 1853, attracted much attention,\nboth the style and the matter being singularly fresh and\noriginal. He has since republished it, with alterations which\nserve to show that he can be docile toward intelligent\ncriticisms. About the same time he prepared for the French\nAcademy his work upon the historian Livy, which was crowned in\n1855. Suffering then from overwork, he was obliged to make a\nshort journey to the Pyrenees, which he has since described in a\ncharming little volume, illustrated by Dore.",
        "His subsequent works are a treatise on the French philosophers of\nthe present century, in which the vapid charlatanism of M. Cousin\nis satisfactorily dealt with; a history of English literature in\nfive volumes; a humorous book on Paris; three volumes upon the\ngeneral theory of art; and two volumes of travels in Italy;\nbesides a considerable collection of historical and critical\nessays. We think that several of these works would be interesting\nto the American public, and might profitably be translated.",
        "Some three or four years ago, M. Taine was appointed Professor in\nthe ecole des Beaux Arts, and we suppose his journey to Italy\nmust have been undertaken partly with a view to qualify himself\nfor his new position. He visited the four cities which may be\nconsidered the artistic centres of Italy,—Rome, Naples,\nFlorence, and Venice,—and a large part of his account of his\njourney is taken up with descriptions and criticisms of pictures,\nstatues, and buildings.",
        "This is a department of criticism which, we may as well frankly\nacknowledge, is far better appreciated on the continent of Europe\nthan in England or America. Over the English race there passed,\nabout two centuries ago, a deluge of Puritanism, which for a time\nalmost drowned out its artistic tastes and propensities. The\nPuritan movement, in proportion to its success, was nearly as\ndestructive to art in the West, as Mohammedanism had long before\nbeen in the East. In its intense and one-sided regard for\nmorality, Puritanism not only relegated the love for beauty to an\ninferior place, but contemned and spat upon it, as something\nsinful and degrading. Hence, the utter architectural impotence\nwhich characterizes the Americans and the modern English; and\nhence the bewildered ignorant way in which we ordinarily\ncontemplate pictures and statues. For two centuries we have been\nremoved from an artistic environment, and consequently can with\ndifficulty enter into the feelings of those who have all this\ntime been nurtured in love for art, and belief in art for its own\nsake. These peculiarities, as Mr. Mill has ably pointed out, have\nentered deep into our ethnic character. Even in pure morals there\nis a radical difference between the Englishman and the inhabitant\nof the continent of Europe. The Englishman follows virtue from a\nsense of duty, the Frenchman from an emotional aspiration toward\nthe beautiful The one admires a noble action because it is right,\nthe other because it is attractive. And this difference underlies\nthe moral judgments upon men and events which are to be found\nrespectively in English and in continental literature. By keeping\nit constantly in view, we shall be enabled to understand many\nthings which might otherwise surprise us in the writings of\nFrench authors.",
        "We are now slowly outgrowing the extravagances of Puritanism. It\nhas given us an earnestness and sobriety of character, to which\nmuch of our real greatness is owing, both here and in the mother\ncountry. It has made us stronger and steadier, but it has at the\nsame time narrowed us in many respects, and rendered our lives\nincomplete. This incompleteness, entailed by Puritanism, we are\ngradually getting rid of; and we are learning to admire and\nrespect many things upon which Puritanism set its mark of\ncontempt. We are beginning, for instance, to recognize the\ntranscendent merits of that great civilizing agency, the drama;\nwe no longer think it necessary that our temples for worshipping\nGod should be constructed like hideous barracks; we are gradually\npermitting our choirs to discard the droning and sentimental\nmodern “psalm-tune” for the inspiring harmonies of Beethoven and\nMozart; and we admit the classical picture and the undraped\nstatue to a high place in our esteem. Yet with all this it will\nprobably be some time before genuine art ceases to be an exotic\namong us, and becomes a plant of unhindered native growth. It\nwill be some time before we cease to regard pictures and statues\nas a higher species of upholstery, and place them in the same\ncategory with poems and dramas, duly reverencing them as\nauthentic revelations of the beauty which is to be found in\nnature. It will be some time before we realize that art is a\nthing to be studied, as well as literature, and before we can be\nquite reconciled to the familiar way in which a Frenchman quotes\na picture as we would quote a poem or novel.",
        "Artistic genius, as M. Taine has shown, is something which will\ndevelop itself only under peculiar social circumstances; and,\ntherefore, if we have not art, we can perhaps only wait for it,\ntrusting that when the time comes it will arise among us. But\nwithout originating, we may at least intelligently appreciate.\nThe nature of a work of art, and the mode in which it is\nproduced, are subjects well worthy of careful study. Architecture\nand music, poetry, painting and sculpture, have in times past\nconstituted a vast portion of human activity; and without knowing\nsomething of the philosophy of art, we need not hope to\nunderstand thoroughly the philosophy of history.",
        "In entering upon the study of art in general, one may find many\nsuggestive hints in the little books of M. Taine, reprinted from\nthe lectures which he has been delivering at the ecole des Beaux\nArts. The first, on the Philosophy of Art, designated at the head\nof this paper, is already accessible to the American reader; and\ntranslations of the others are probably soon to follow. We shall\nfor the present give a mere synopsis of M. Taine’s general views.",
        "And first it must be determined what a work of art is. Leaving\nfor a while music and architecture out of consideration, it will\nbe admitted that poetry, painting, and sculpture have one obvious\ncharacter in common: they are arts of IMITATION. This, says\nTaine, appears at first sight to be their essential character. It\nwould appear that their great object is to IMITATE as closely as\npossible. It is obvious that a statue is intended to imitate a\nliving man, that a picture is designed to represent real persons\nin real attitudes, or the interior of a house, or a landscape,\nsuch as it exists in nature. And it is no less clear that a novel\nor drama endeavours to represent with accuracy real characters,\nactions, and words, giving as precise and faithful an image of\nthem as possible. And when the imitation is incomplete, we say to\nthe painter, “Your people are too largely proportioned, and the\ncolour of your trees is false\"; we tell the sculptor that his leg\nor arm is incorrectly modelled; and we say to the dramatist,\n\"Never has a man felt or thought as your hero is supposed to have\nfelt and thought.”",
        "This truth, moreover, is seen. both in the careers of individual\nartists, and in the general history of art. According to Taine,\nthe life of an artist may generally be divided into two parts. In\nthe first period, that of natural growth, he studies nature\nanxiously and minutely, he keeps the objects themselves before\nhis eyes, and strives to represent them with scrupulous fidelity.\nBut when the time for mental growth ends, as it does with every\nman, and the crystallization of ideas and impressions commences,\nthen the mind of the artist is no longer so susceptible to new\nimpressions from without. He begins to nourish himself from his\nown substance. He abandons the living model, and with recipes\nwhich he has gathered in the course of his experience, he\nproceeds to construct a drama or novel, a picture or statue. Now,\nthe first period, says Taine, is that of genuine art; the second\nis that of mannerism. Our author cites the case of Michael\nAngelo, a man who was one of the most colossal embodiments of\nphysical and mental energy that the world has ever seen. In\nMichael Angelo’s case, the period of growth, of genuine art, may\nbe said to have lasted until after his sixtieth year. But look,\nsays Taine, at the works which he executed in his old age;\nconsider the Conversion of St. Paul, and the Last Judgment,\npainted when he was nearly seventy. Even those who are not\nconnoisseurs can see that these frescos are painted by rule, that\nthe artist, having stocked his memory with a certain set of\nforms, is making use of them to fill out his tableau; that he\nwantonly multiplies queer attitudes and ingenious\nforeshortenings; that the lively invention, the grand outburst of\nfeeling, the perfect truth, by which his earlier works are\ndistinguished, have disappeared; and that, if he is still\nsuperior to all others, he is nevertheless inferior to himself.\nThe careers of Scott, of Goethe, and of Voltaire will furnish\nparallel examples. In every school of art, too, the flourishing\nperiod is followed by one of decline; and in every case the\ndecline is due to a failure to imitate the living models. In\npainting, we have the exaggerated foreshorteners and\nmuscle-makers who copied Michael Angelo; the lovers of theatrical\ndecorations who succeeded Titian and Giorgione and the degenerate\nboudoir-painters who followed Claucle and Poussin. In literature,\nwe have the versifiers, epigrammatists, and rhetors of the Latin\ndecadence; the sensual and declamatory dramatists who represent\nthe last stages of old English comedy; and the makers of sonnets\nand madrigals, or conceited euphemists of the Gongora school, in\nthe decline of Italian and Spanish poetry. Briefly it may be\nsaid, that the masters copy nature and the pupils copy the\nmasters. In this way are explained the constantly recurring\nphenomena of decline in art, and thus, also, it is seen that art\nis perfect in proportion as it successfully imitates nature.",
        "But we are not to conclude that absolute imitation is the sole\nand entire object of art. Were this the case, the finest works\nwould be those which most minutely correspond to their external\nprototypes. In sculpture, a mould taken from the living features\nis that which gives the most faithful representation of the\nmodel; but a well-moulded bust is far from being equal to a good\nstatue. Photography is in many respects more accurate than\npainting; but no one would rank a photograph, however exquisitely\nexecuted, with an original picture. And finally, if exact\nimitation were the supreme object of art, the best tragedy, the\nbest comedy, and the best drama would be a stenographic report of\nthe proceedings in a court of justice, in a family gathering, in\na popular meeting, in the Rump Congress. Even the works of\nartists are not rated in proportion to their minute exactness.\nNeither in painting nor in any other art do we give the\nprecedence to that which deceives the eye simply. Every one\nremembers how Zeuxis was said to have painted grapes so\nfaithfully that the birds came and pecked at them; and how,\nParrhasios, his rival, surpassed even this feat by painting a\ncurtain so natural in its appearance that Zeuxis asked him to\npull it aside and show the picture behind it. All this is not\nart, but mere knack and trickery. Perhaps no painter was ever so\nminute as Denner. It used to take him four years to make one\nportrait. He would omit nothing,—neither the bluish lines made\nby the veins under the skin, nor the little black points\nscattered over the nose, nor the bright spots in the eye where\nneighbouring objects are reflected; the head seems to start out\nfrom the canvas, it is so like flesh and blood. Yet who cares for\nDenner’s portraits? And who would not give ten times as much for\none which Van Dyck or Tintoretto might have painted in a few\nhours? So in the churches of Naples and Spain we find statues\ncoloured and draped, saints clothed in real coats, with their\nskin yellow and bloodless, their hands bleeding, and their feet\nbruised; and beside them Madonnas in royal habiliments, in gala\ndresses of lustrous silk, adorned with diadems, precious\nnecklaces, bright ribbons, and elegant laces, with their cheeks\nrosy, their eyes brilliant, their eyelashes sweeping. And by this\nexcess of literal imitation, there is awakened a feeling, not of\npleasure, but always of repugnance, often of disgust, and\nsometimes of horror So in literature, the ancient Greek theatre,\nand the best Spanish and English dramatists, alter on purpose the\nnatural current of human speech, and make their characters talk\nunder all the restraints of rhyme and rhythm. But we pronounce\nthis departure from literal truth a merit and not a defect. We\nconsider Goethe’s second “Iphigenie,” written in verse, far\npreferable to the first one written in prose; nay, it is the\nrhythm or metre itself which communicates to the work its\nincomparable beauty. In a review of Longfellow’s “Dante,\"\npublished last year, we argued this very point in one of its\nspecial applications; the artist must copy his original, but he\nmust not copy it too literally.",
        "What then must he copy? He must copy, says Taine, the mutual\nrelations and interdependences of the parts of his model. And\nmore than this, he must render the essential characteristic of\nthe object—that characteristic upon which all the minor\nqualities depend—as salient and conspicuous as possible. He must\nput into the background the traits which conceal it, and bring\ninto the foreground the traits which manifest it. If he is\nsculpturing a group like the Laocoon, he must strike upon the\nsupreme moment, that in which the whole tragedy reveals itself,\nand he must pass over those insignificant details of position and\nmovement which serve only to distract our attention and weaken\nour emotions by dividing them. If he is writing a drama, he must\nnot attempt to give us the complete biography of his character;\nhe must depict only those situations which stand in direct\nsubordination to the grand climax or denoument. As a final\nresult, therefore. Taine concludes that a work of art is a\nconcrete representation of the relations existing between the\nparts of an object, with the intent to bring the essential or\ndominating character thereof into prominence.",
        "We should overrun our limits if we were to follow out the\nadmirable discussion in which M. Taine extends this definition to\narchitecture and music. These closely allied arts are\ndistinguished from poetry, painting, and sculpture, by appealing\nfar less directly to the intelligence, and far more exclusively\nto the emotions. Yet these arts likewise aim, by bringing into\nprominence certain relations of symmetry in form as perceived by\nthe eye, or in aerial vibrations as perceived by the ear, to\nexcite in us the states of feeling with which these species of\nsymmetry are by subtle laws of association connected. They, too,\nimitate, not literally, but under the guidance of a predominating\nsentiment or emotion, relations which really exist among the\nphenomena of nature. And here, too, we estimate excellence, not\nin proportion to the direct, but to the indirect imitation. A\nGothic cathedral is not, as has been supposed, directly imitated\nfrom the towering vegetation of Northern forests; but it may well\nbe the expression of the dim sentiment of an unseen,\nall-pervading Power, generated by centuries of primeval life amid\nsuch forests. So the sounds which in a symphony of Beethoven are\nwoven into a web of such amazing complexity may exist in\ndifferent combinations in nature; but when a musician steps out\nof his way to imitate the crowing of cocks or the roar of the\ntempest, we regard his achievement merely as a graceful conceit.\nArt is, therefore, an imitation of nature; but it is an\nintellectual and not a mechanical imitation; and the performances\nof the camera and the music-box are not to be classed with those\nof the violinist’s bow or the sculptor’s chisel.",
        "And lastly, in distinguishing art from science, Taine remarks,\nthat in disengaging from their complexity the, causes which are\nat work in nature, and the fundamental laws according to which\nthey work, science describes them in abstract formulas conveyed\nin technical language. But art reveals these operative causes and\nthese dominant laws, not in arid definitions, inaccessible to\nmost people, intelligible only to specially instructed men, but\nin a concrete symbol, addressing itself not only to the\nunderstanding, but still more to the sentiments of the ordinary\nman. Art has, therefore, this peculiarity, that it is at once\nelevated and popular, that it manifests that which is often most\nrecondite, and that it manifests it to all.",
        "Having determined what a work of art is, our author goes on to\nstudy the social conditions under which works of art are\nproduced; and he concludes that the general character of a work\nof art is determined by the state of intellect and morals in the\nsociety in which it is executed. There is, in fact, a sort of\nmoral temperature which acts upon mental development much as\nphysical temperature acts upon organic development. The condition\nof society does not produce the artist’s talent; but it assists\nor checks its efforts to display itself; it decides whether or\nnot it shall be successful And it exerts a “natural selection\"\nbetween different kinds of talents, stimulating some and starving\nothers. To make this perfectly clear, we will cite at some length\nTaine’s brilliant illustration.",
        "The case chosen for illustration is a very simple one,—that of a\nstate of society in which one of the predominant feelings is\nmelancholy. This is not an arbitrary supposition, for such a time\nhas occurred more than once in human history; in Asia, in the\nsixth century before Christ, and especially in Europe, from the\nfourth to the tenth centuries of our era. To produce such a state\nof feeling, five or six generations of decadence, accompanied\nwith diminution of population, foreign invasions, famines,\npestilences, and increasing difficulty in procuring the\nnecessaries of life, are amply sufficient. It then happens that\nmen lose courage and hope, and consider life an evil. Now,\nadmitting that among the artists who live in such a time, there\nare likely to be the same relative numbers of melancholy, joyous,\nor indifferent temperaments as at other times, let us see how\nthey will be affected by reigning circumstances.",
        "Let us first remember, says Taine, that the evils which depress\nthe public will also depress the artist. His risks are no less\nthan those of less gifted people. He is liable to suffer from\nplague or famine, to be ruined by unfair taxation or\nconscription, or to see his children massacred and his wife led\ninto captivity by barbarians. And if these ills do not reach him\npersonally, he must at least behold those around him affected by\nthem. In this way, if he is joyous by temperament, he must\ninevitably become less joyous; if he is melancholy, he must\nbecome more melancholy.",
        "Secondly, having been reared among melancholy contemporaries, his\neducation will have exerted upon him a corresponding influence.\nThe prevailing religious doctrine, accommodated to the state of\naffairs, will tell him that the earth is a place of exile, life\nan evil, gayety a snare, and his most profitable occupation will\nbe to get ready to die. Philosophy, constructing its system of\nmorals in conformity to the existing phenomena of decadence, will\ntell him that he had better never have been born. Daily\nconversation will inform him of horrible events, of the\ndevastation of a province, the sack of a town by the Goths, the\noppression of the neighbouring peasants by the imperial\ntax-collectors, or the civil war that has just burst out between\nhalf a dozen pretenders to the throne. As he travels about, he\nbeholds signs of mourning and despair, crowds of beggars, people\ndying of hunger, a broken bridge which no one is mending, an\nabandoned suburb which is going to ruin, fields choked with\nweeds, the blackened walls of burned houses. Such sights and\nimpressions, repeated from childhood to old age (and we must\nremember that this has actually been the state of things in what\nare now the fairest parts of the globe), cannot fail to deepen\nwhatever elements of melancholy there may be already in the\nartist’s disposition.",
        "The operation of all these causes will be enhanced by that very\npeculiarity of the artist which constitutes his talent. For,\naccording to the definitions above given, that which makes him an\nartist is his capacity for seizing upon the essential\ncharacteristics and the salient traits of surrounding objects and\nevents. Other men see things in part fragmentarily; he catches\nthe spirit of the ensemble. And in this way he will very likely\nexaggerate in his works the general average of contemporary\nfeeling.",
        "Lastly, our author reminds us that a man who writes or paints\ndoes not remain alone before his easel or his writing-desk. He\ngoes out, looks about him, receives suggestions from friends,\nfrom rivals, from books, and works of art whenever accessible,\nand hears the criticisms of the public upon his own productions\nand those of his contemporaries. In order to succeed, he must not\nonly satisfy to some extent the popular taste, but he must feel\nthat the public is in sympathy with him. If in this period of\nsocial decadence and gloom he endeavours to represent gay,\nbrilliant, or triumphant ideas, he will find himself left to his\nown resources; and, as Taine rightly says, the power of an\nisolated man is always insignificant. His work will be likely to\nbe mediocre. If he attempts to write like Rabelais or paint like\nRubens, he will get neither assistance nor sympathy from a public\nwhich prefers the pictures of Rembrandt, the melodies of Chopin,\nand the poetry of Heine.",
        "Having thus explained his position by this extreme instance,\nsignified for the sake of clearness, Taine goes on to apply such\ngeneral considerations to four historic epochs, taken in all\ntheir complexity. He discusses the aspect presented by art in\nancient Greece, in the feudal and Catholic Middle Ages, in the\ncentralized monarchies of the seventeenth century, and in the\nscientific, industrial democracy in which we now live. Out of\nthese we shall select, as perhaps the simplest, the case of\nancient Greece, still following our author closely, though\nnecessarily omitting many interesting details.",
        "The ancient Greeks, observes Taine, understood life in a new and\noriginal manner. Their energies were neither absorbed by a great\nreligious conception, as in the case of the Hindus and Egyptians,\nnor by a vast social organization, as in the case of the\nAssyrians and Persians, nor by a purely industrial and commercial\nregime, as in the case of the Phoenicians and Carthaginians.\nInstead of a theocracy or a rigid system of castes, instead of a\nmonarchy with a hierarchy of civil officials, the men of this\nrace invented a peculiar institution, the City, each city giving\nrise to others like itself, and from colony to colony reproducing\nitself indefinitely. A single Greek city, for instance, Miletos,\nproduced three hundred other cities, colonizing with them the\nentire coast of the Black Sea. Each city was substantially\nself-ruling; and the idea of a coalescence of several cities into\na nation was one which the Greek mind rarely conceived, and never\nwas able to put into operation.",
        "In these cities, labour was for the most part carried on by\nslaves. In Athens there were four or five for each citizen, and\nin places like Korinth and Aigina the slave population is said to\nhave numbered four or five hundred thousand. Besides, the Greek\ncitizen had little need of personal service. He lived out of\ndoors, and, like most Southern people, was comparatively\nabstemious in his habits. His dinners were slight, his clothing\nwas simple, his house was scantily furnished, being intended\nchiefly for a den to sleep in.",
        "Serving neither king nor priest, the citizen was free and\nsovereign in his own city. He elected his own magistrates, and\nmight himself serve as city-ruler, as juror, or as judge.\nRepresentation was unknown. Legislation was carried on by all the\ncitizens assembled in mass. Therefore politics and war were the\nsole or chief employments of the citizen. War, indeed, came in\nfor no slight share of his attention. For society was not so well\nprotected as in these modern days. Most of these Greek cities,\nscattered over the coasts of the Aigeian, the Black Sea, and the\nMediterranean, were surrounded by tribes of barbarians,\nScythians, Gauls Spaniards, and Africans. The citizen must\ntherefore keep on his guard, like the Englishman of to-day in New\nZealand, or like the inhabitant of a Massachusetts town in tho\nseventeenth century. Otherwise Gauls Samnites, or Bithynians, as\nsavage as North American Indians, would be sure to encamp upon\nthe blackened ruins of his town. Moreover, the Greek cities had\ntheir quarrels with each other, and their laws of war were very\nbarbarous. A conquered city was liable to be razed to the ground,\nits male inhabitants put to the sword, its women sold as slaves.\nUnder such circumstances, according to Taine’s happy expression,\na citizen must be a politician and warrior, on pain of death. And\nnot only fear, but ambition also tended to make him so. For each\ncity strove to subject or to humiliate its neighbours, to acquire\ntribute, or to exact homage from its rivals. Thus the citizen\npassed his life in the public square, discussing alliances,\ntreaties, and constitutions, hearing speeches, or speaking\nhimself, and finally going aboard of his ship to fight his\nneighbour Greeks, or to sail against Egypt or Persia.",
        "War (and politics as subsidiary to it) was then the chief pursuit\nof life. But as there was no organized industry, so there were no\nmachines of warfare. All fighting was done hand to hand.\nTherefore, the great thing in preparing for war was not to\ntransform the soldiers into precisely-acting automata, as in a\nmodern army, but to make each separate soldier as vigorous and\nactive as possible. The leading object of Greek education was to\nmake men physically perfect. In this respect, Sparta may be taken\nas the typical Greek community, for nowhere else was physical\ndevelopment so entirely made the great end of social life. In\nthese matters Sparta was always regarded by the other cities as\ntaking the lead,—as having attained the ideal after which all\nalike were striving. Now Sparta, situated in the midst of a\nnumerous conquered population of Messenians and Helots, was\npartly a great gymnasium and partly a perpetual camp. Her\ncitizens were always in training. The entire social constitution\nof Sparta was shaped with a view to the breeding and bringing up\nof a strong and beautiful race. Feeble or ill-formed infants were\nput to death. The age at which citizens might marry was\nprescribed by law; and the State paired off men and women as the\nmodern breeder pairs off horses, with a sole view to the\nexcellence of the off-spring. A wife was not a helpmate, but a\nbearer of athletes. Women boxed, wrestled, and raced; a\ncircumstance referred to in the following passage of\nAristophanes, as rendered by Mr. Felton:—",
        "The young men lived together, like soldiers in a camp. They ate\nout-of-doors, at a public table. Their fare was as simple as that\nof a modern university boat-crew before a race. They slept in the\nopen air, and spent their waking hours in wrestling, boxing,\nrunning races, throwing quoits, and engaging in mock battles.\nThis was the way in which the Spartans lived; and though no other\ncity carried this discipline to such an extent, yet in all a very\nlarge portion of the citizen’s life was spent in making himself\nhardy and robust.",
        "The ideal man, in the eyes of a Greek, was, therefore not the\ncontemplative or delicately susceptible thinker but the naked\nathlete, with firm flesh and swelling muscles. Most of their\nbarbarian neighbours were ashamed to be seen undressed, but the\nGreeks seem to have felt little embarrassment in appearing naked\nin public. Their gymnastic habits entirely transformed their\nsense of shame. Their Olympic and other public games were a\ntriumphant display of naked physical perfection. Young men of the\nnoblest families and from the farthest Greek colonies came to\nthem, and wrestled and ran, undraped, before countless multitudes\nof admiring spectators. Note, too, as significant, that the Greek\nera began with the Olympic games, and that time was reckoned by\nthe intervals between them; as well as the fact that the grandest\nlyric poetry of antiquity was written in celebration of these\ngymnastic contests. The victor in the foot-race gave his name to\nthe current Olympiad; and on reaching home, was received by his\nfellow-citizens as if he had been a general returning from a\nsuccessful campaign. To be the most beautiful man in Greece was\nin the eyes of a Greek the height of human felicity; and with the\nGreeks, beauty necessarily included strength. So ardently did\nthis gifted people admire corporeal perfection that they actually\nworshipped it. According to Herodotos, a young Sicilian was\ndeified on account of his beauty, and after his death altars were\nraised to him. The vast intellectual power of Plato and Sokrates\ndid not prevent them from sharing this universal enthusiasm.\nPoets like Sophokles, and statesmen like Alexander, thought it\nnot beneath their dignity to engage publicly in gymnastic sports.",
        "Their conceptions of divinity were framed in accordance with\nthese general habits. Though sometimes, as in the case of\nHephaistos, the exigencies of the particular myth required the\ndeity to be physically imperfect, yet ordinarily the Greek god\nwas simply an immortal man, complete in strength and beauty. The\ndeity was not invested with the human form as a mere symbol. They\ncould conceive no loftier way of representing him. The grandest\nstatue, expressing most adequately the calmness of absolutely\nunfettered strength, might well, in their eyes, be a veritable\nportrait of divinity. To a Greek, beauty of form was a\nconsecrated thing. More than once a culprit got off with his life\nbecause it would have been thought sacrilegious to put an end to\nsuch a symmetrical creature. And for a similar reason, the\nGreeks, though perhaps not more humane than the Europeans of the\nMiddle Ages, rarely allowed the human body to be mutilated or\ntortured. The condemned criminal must be marred as little as\npossible; and he was, therefore, quietly poisoned, instead of\nbeing hung, beheaded, or broken on the wheel.",
        "Is not the unapproachable excellence of Greek statuary—that art\nnever since equalled, and most likely, from the absence of the\nneedful social stimulus, destined never to be equalled—already\nsufficiently explained? Consider, says our author, the nature of\nthe Greek sculptor’s preparation. These men have observed the\nhuman body naked and in movement, in the bath and the gymnasium,\nin sacred dances and public games. They have noted those forms\nand attitudes in which are revealed vigour, health, and activity.\nAnd during three or four hundred years they have thus modified,\ncorrected and developed their notions of corporeal beauty. There\nis, therefore, nothing surprising in the fact that Greek\nsculpture finally arrived at the ideal model, the perfect type,\nas it was, of the human body. Our highest notions of physical\nbeauty, down to the present day, have been bequeathed to us by\nthe Greeks. The earliest modern sculptors who abandoned the bony,\nhideous, starveling figures of the monkish Middle Ages, learned\ntheir first lessons in better things from Greek bas-reliefs. And\nif, to-day, forgetting our half-developed bodies, inefficiently\nnourished, because of our excessive brain-work, and with their\nmuscles weak and flabby from want of strenuous exercise, we wish\nto contemplate the human form in its grandest perfection, we must\ngo to Hellenic art for our models.",
        "The Greeks were, in the highest sense of the word, an\nintellectual race; but they never allowed the mind to tyrannize\nover the body. Spiritual perfection, accompanied by corporeal\nfeebleness, was the invention of asceticism; and the Greeks were\nnever ascetics. Diogenes might scorn superfluous luxuries, but if\nhe ever rolled and tumbled his tub about as Rabelais says he did,\nit is clear that the victory of spirit over body formed no part\nof his theory of things. Such an idea would have been\nincomprehensible to a Greek in Plato’s time. Their consciences\nwere not over active. They were not burdened with a sense of\nsinfulness. Their aspirations were decidedly finite; and they\nbelieved in securing the maximum completeness of this terrestrial\nlife. Consequently they never set the physical below the\nintellectual. To return to our author, they never, in their\nstatues, subordinated symmetry to expression, the body to the\nhead. They were interested not only in the prominence of the\nbrows, the width of the forehead, and the curvature of the lips,\nbut quite as much in the massiveness of the chest, the\ncompactness of the thighs, and the solidity of the arms and legs.\nNot only the face, but the whole body, had for them its\nphysiognomy. They left picturesqueness to the painter, and\ndramatic fervour to the poet; and keeping strictly before their\neyes the narrow but exalted problem of representing the beauty of\nsymmetry, they filled their sanctuaries and public places with\nthose grand motionless people of brass, gold, ivory, copper, and\nmarble, in whom humanity recognizes its highest artistic types.\nStatuary was the central art of Greece. No other art was so\npopular, or so completely expressed the national life. The number\nof statues was enormous. In later days, when Rome had spoiled the\nGreek world of its treasures, the Imperial City possessed a\npopulation of statues almost equal in number to its population of\nhuman beings. And at the present day, after all the destructive\naccidents of so many intervening centuries, it is estimated that\nmore than sixty thousand statues have been obtained from Rome and\nits suburbs alone.",
        "In citing this admirable exposition as a specimen of M. Taine’s\nmethod of dealing with his subject, we have refrained from\ndisturbing the pellucid current of thought by criticisms of our\nown. We think the foregoing explanation correct enough, so far as\nit goes, though it deals with the merest rudiments of the\nsubject, and really does nothing toward elucidating the deeper\nmysteries of artistic production. For this there is needed a\nprofounder psychology than M. Taine’s. But whether his theory of\nart be adequate or not, there can be but one opinion as to the\nbrilliant eloquence with which it is set forth.",
        "  June, 1868.",
        "IN a very interesting essay on British and Foreign\nCharacteristics, published a few years ago, Mr. W. R. Greg quotes\nthe famous letter of the Turkish cadi to Mr. Layard, with the\ncomment that “it contains the germ and element of a wisdom to\nwhich our busy and bustling existence is a stranger\"; and he uses\nit as a text for an instructive sermon on the “gospel of\nleisure.” He urges, with justice, that the too eager and restless\nmodern man, absorbed in problems of industrial development, may\nlearn a wholesome lesson from the contemplation of his Oriental\nbrother, who cares not to say, “Behold, this star spinneth round\nthat star, and this other star with a tail cometh and goeth in so\nmany years\"; who aspires not after a “double stomach,” nor hopes\nto attain to Paradise by “seeking with his eyes.” If any one may\nbe thought to stand in need of some such lesson, it is the\nAmerican of to-day. Just as far as the Turk carries his apathy to\nexcess, does the American carry to excess his restlessness. But\njust because the incurious idleness of the Turk is excessive, so\nas to be detrimental to completeness of living, it is unfit to\nsupply us with the hints we need concerning the causes,\ncharacter, and effects of our over-activity. A sermon of leisure,\nif it is to be of practical use to us, must not be a sermon of\nlaziness. The Oriental state of mind is incompatible with\nprogressive improvement of any sort, physical, intellectual, or\nmoral. It is one of the phenomena attendant upon the arrival of a\ncommunity at a stationary condition before it has acquired a\ncomplex civilization. And it appears serviceable rather as a\nbackground upon which to exhibit in relief our modern turmoil,\nthan by reason of any lesson which it is itself likely to convey.\nLet us in preference study one of the most eminently progressive\nof all the communities that have existed. Let us take an example\nquite different from any that can be drawn from Oriental life,\nbut almost equally contrasted with any that can be found among\nourselves; and let us, with the aid of it, examine the respective\neffects of leisure and of hurry upon the culture of the\ncommunity.",
        "What do modern critics mean by the “healthy completeness” of\nancient life, which they are so fond of contrasting with the\n\"heated,” “discontented,” or imperfect and one-sided existence of\nmodern communities? Is this a mere set of phrases, suited to some\nimaginary want of the literary critic, but answering to nothing\nreal? Are they to be summarily disposed of as resting upon some\ntacit assumption of that old-grannyism which delights in\nasseverating that times are not what they used to be? Is the\ncontrast an imaginary one, due to the softened, cheerful light\nwith which we are wont to contemplate classic antiquity through\nthe charmed medium of its incomparable literature? Or is it a\nreal contrast, worthy of the attention and analysis of the\nhistorical inquirer? The answer to these queries will lead us far\ninto the discussion of the subject which we have propounded, and\nwe shall best reach it by considering some aspects of the social\ncondition of ancient Greece. The lessons to be learned from that\nwonderful country are not yet exhausted Each time that we return\nto that richest of historic mines, and delve faithfully and\ncarefully, we shall be sure to dig up some jewel worth carrying\naway.",
        "And in considering ancient Greece, we shall do well to confine\nour attention, for the sake of definiteness of conception, to a\nsingle city. Comparatively homogeneous as Greek civilization was,\nthere was nevertheless a great deal of difference between the\nsocial circumstances of sundry of its civic communities. What was\ntrue of Athens was frequently not true of Sparta or Thebes, and\ngeneral assertions about ancient Greece are often likely to be\ncollect only in a loose and general way. In speaking, therefore,\nof Greece, I must be understood in the main as referring to\nAthens, the eye and light of Greece, the nucleus and centre of\nHellenic culture.",
        "Let us note first that Athens was a large city surrounded by\npleasant village-suburbs,—the demes of Attika,—very much as\nBoston is closely girdled by rural places like Brookline, Jamaica\nPlain, and the rest, village after village rather thickly\ncovering a circuit of from ten to twenty miles’ radius. The\npopulation of Athens with its suburbs may perhaps have exceeded\nhalf a million; but the number of adult freemen bearing arms did\nnot exceed twenty-five thousand.[67] For every one of these\nfreemen there were four or five slaves; not ignorant, degraded\nlabourers, belonging to an inferior type of humanity, and bearing\nthe marks of a lower caste in their very personal formation and\nin the colour of their skin, like our lately-enslaved negroes;\nbut intelligent, skilled labourers, belonging usually to the\nHellenic, and at any rate to the Aryan race, as fair and perhaps\nas handsome as their masters, and not subjected to especial\nignominy or hardship. These slaves, of whom there were at least\none hundred thousand adult males, relieved the twenty-five\nthousand freemen of nearly all the severe drudgery of life; and\nthe result was an amount of leisure perhaps never since known on\nan equal scale in history.",
        "[67] See Herod. V. 97; Aristoph. Ekkl. 432; Thukyd. II. 13;\nPlutarch, Perikl. 37.",
        "The relations of master and slave in ancient Athens constituted,\nof course, a very different phenomenon from anything which the\nhistory of our own Southern States has to offer us. Our Southern\nslaveholders lived in an age of industrial development; they were\nmoney-makers: they had their full share of business in managing\nthe operations for which their labourers supplied the crude\nphysical force. It was not so in Athens. The era of civilization\nfounded upon organized industry had not begun; money-making had\nnot come to be, with the Greeks, the one all-important end of\nlife; and mere subsistence, which is now difficult, was then\neasy. The Athenian lived in a mild, genial, healthy climate, in a\ncountry which has always been notable for the activity and\nlongevity of its inhabitants. He was frugal in his habits,—a\nwine-drinker and an eater of meat, but rarely addicted to\ngluttony or intemperance. His dress was inexpensive, for the\nGreek climate made but little protection necessary, and the\ngymnastic habits of the Greeks led them to esteem more highly the\nbeauty of the body than that of its covering. His house was\nsimple, not being intended for social purposes, while of what we\nshould call home-life the Greeks had none. The house was a\nshelter at night, a place where the frugal meal might be taken, a\nplace where the wife might stay, and look after the household\nslaves or attend to the children. And this brings us to another\nnotable feature of Athenian life. The wife having no position in\nsociety, being nothing, indeed, but a sort of household utensil,\nhow greatly was life simplified! What a door for expenditure was\nthere, as yet securely closed, and which no one had thought of\nopening! No milliner’s or dressmaker’s bills, no evening parties,\nno Protean fashions, no elegant furniture, no imperious necessity\nfor Kleanthes to outshine Kleon, no coaches, no Chateau Margaux,\nno journeys to Arkadia in the summer! In such a state of society,\nas one may easily see, the labour of one man would support half a\ndozen. It cost the Athenian but a few cents daily to live, and\neven these few cents might be earned by his slaves. We need not,\ntherefore, be surprised to learn that in ancient Athens there\nwere no paupers or beggars. There might be poverty, but indigence\nwas unknown; and because of the absence of fashion, style, and\ndisplay, even poverty entailed no uncomfortable loss of social\nposition. The Athenians valued wealth highly, no doubt, as a\nsource of contributions to public festivals and to the\nnecessities of the state. But as far as the circumstances of\ndaily life go, the difference between the rich man and the poor\nman was immeasurably less than in any modern community, and the\nincentives to the acquirement of wealth were, as a consequence,\ncomparatively slight.",
        "I do not mean to say that the Athenians did not engage in\nbusiness. Their city was a commercial city, and their ships\ncovered the Mediterranean. They had agencies and factories at\nMarseilles, on the remote coasts of Spain, and along the shores\nof the Black Sea. They were in many respects the greatest\ncommercial people of antiquity, and doubtless knew, as well as\nother people, the keen delights of acquisition. But my point is,\nthat with them the acquiring of property had not become the chief\nor only end of life. Production was carried on almost entirely by\nslave-labour; interchange of commodities was the business of the\nmasters, and commerce was in those days simple. Banks, insurance\ncompanies, brokers’ boards,—all these complex instruments of\nMammon were as yet unthought of. There was no Wall Street in\nancient Athens; there were no great failures, no commercial\npanics, no over-issues of stock. Commerce, in short, was a quite\nsubordinate matter, and the art of money-making was in its\ninfancy.",
        "The twenty-five thousand Athenian freemen thus enjoyed, on the\nwhole, more undisturbed leisure, more freedom from petty\nharassing cares, than any other community known to history.\nNowhere else can we find, on careful study, so little of the\nhurry and anxiety which destroys the even tenour of modern\nlife,—nowhere else so few of the circumstances which tend to\nmake men insane, inebriate, or phthisical, or prematurely old.",
        "This being granted, it remains only to state and illustrate the\nobverse fact. It is not only true that Athens has produced and\neducated a relatively larger number of men of the highest calibre\nand most complete culture than any other community of like\ndimensions which has ever existed; but it is also true that there\nhas been no other community, of which the members have, as a\ngeneral rule, been so highly cultivated, or have attained\nindividually such completeness of life. In proof of the first\nassertion it will be enough to mention such names as those of\nSolon, Themistokles, Perikles, and Demosthenes; Isokrates and\nLysias; Aristophanes and Menander; Aischylos, Sophokles, and\nEuripides; Pheidias and Praxiteles; Sokrates and Plato;\nThukydides and Xenophon: remembering that these men,\ndistinguished for such different kinds of achievement, but like\neach other in consummateness of culture, were all produced within\none town in the course of three centuries. At no other time and\nplace in human history has there been even an approach to such a\nfact as this.",
        "My other assertion, about the general culture of the community in\nwhich such men were reared, will need a more detailed\nexplanation. When I say that the Athenian public was, on the\nwhole, the most highly cultivated public that has ever existed, I\nrefer of course to something more than what is now known as\nliterary culture. Of this there was relatively little in the days\nof Athenian greatness; and this was because there was not yet\nneed for it or room for it. Greece did not until a later time\nbegin to produce scholars and savants; for the function of\nscholarship does not begin until there has been an accumulation\nof bygone literature to be interpreted for the benefit of those\nwho live in a later time. Grecian greatness was already becoming\na thing of the past, when scholarship and literary culture of the\nmodern type began at Rome and Alexandria. The culture of the\nancient Athenians was largely derived from direct intercourse\nwith facts of nature and of life, and with the thoughts of rich\nand powerful minds orally expressed. The value of this must not\nbe underrated. We moderns are accustomed to get so large a\nportion of our knowledge and of our theories of life out of\nbooks, our taste and judgment are so largely educated by\nintercourse with the printed page, that we are apt to confound\nculture with book-knowledge; we are apt to forget the innumerable\nways in which the highest intellectual faculties may be\ndisciplined without the aid of literature. We must study\nantiquity to realize how thoroughly this could be done. But even\nin our day, how much more fruitful is the direct influence of an\noriginal mind over us, in the rare cases when it can be enjoyed,\nthan any indirect influence which the same mind may exert through\nthe medium of printed books! What fellow of a college, placed\namid the most abundant and efficient implements of study, ever\ngets such a stimulus to the highest and richest intellectual life\nas was afforded to Eckermann by his daily intercourse with\nGoethe? The breadth of culture and the perfection of training\nexhibited by John Stuart Mill need not surprise us when we\nrecollect that his earlier days were spent in the society of\nJames Mill and Jeremy Bentham. And the remarkable extent of view,\nthe command of facts, and the astonishing productiveness of such\nmodern Frenchmen as Sainte-Beuve and Littre become explicable\nwhen we reflect upon the circumstance that so many able and\nbrilliant men are collected in one city, where their minds may\ncontinually and directly react upon each other. It is from the\nlack of such personal stimulus that it is difficult or indeed\nwellnigh impossible, even for those whose resources are such as\nto give them an extensive command of books, to keep up to the\nhighest level of contemporary culture while living in a village\nor provincial town. And it is mainly because of the personal\nstimulus which it affords to its students, that a great\nuniversity, as a seat of culture, is immeasurably superior to a\nsmall one.",
        "Nevertheless, the small community in any age possesses one signal\nadvantage over the large one, in its greater simplicity of life\nand its consequent relative leisure. It was the prerogative of\nancient Athens that it united the advantages of the large to\nthose of the small community. In relative simplicity of life it\nwas not unlike the modern village, while at the same time it was\nthe metropolis where the foremost minds of the time were enabled\nto react directly upon one another. In yet another respect these\nopposite advantages were combined. The twenty-five thousand free\ninhabitants might perhaps all know something of each other. In\nthis respect Athens was doubtless much like a New England country\ntown, with the all-important difference that the sordid tone due\nto continual struggle for money was absent. It was like the small\ntown in the chance which it afforded for publicity and community\nof pursuits among its inhabitants. Continuous and unrestrained\nsocial intercourse was accordingly a distinctive feature of\nAthenian life. And, as already hinted, this intercourse did not\nconsist in evening flirtations, with the eating of indigestible\nfood at unseasonable hours, and the dancing of “the German.” It\nwas carried on out-of-doors in the brightest sunlight; it brooked\nno effeminacy; its amusements were athletic games, or dramatic\nentertainments, such as have hardly since been equalled. Its\narena was a town whose streets were filled with statues and\nadorned with buildings, merely to behold which was in itself an\neducation. The participators in it were not men with minds so\ndwarfed by exclusive devotion to special pursuits that after\n\"talking shop” they could find nothing else save wine and cookery\nto converse about. They were men with minds fresh and open for\nthe discussion of topics which are not for a day only.",
        "A man like Sokrates, living in such a community, did not need to\nwrite down his wisdom. He had no such vast public as the modern\nphilosopher has to reach. He could hail any one he happened to\npass in the street, begin an argument with him forthwith, and set\na whole crowd thinking and inquiring about subjects the mere\ncontemplation of which would raise them for the moment above\nmatters of transient concern. For more than half a century any\ncitizen might have gratis the benefit of oral instruction from\nsuch a man as he. And I sometimes think, by the way,\nthat—curtailed as it is to literary proportions in the dialogues\nof Plato, bereft of all that personal potency which it had when\nit flowed, instinct with earnestness, from the lips of the\nteacher—even to this day the wit of man has perhaps devised no\nbetter general gymnastics for the understanding than the Sokratic\ndialectic. I am far from saying that all Athens listened to\nSokrates or understood him: had it been so, the caricature of\nAristophanes would have been pointless, and the sublime yet\nmournful trilogy of dialogues which pourtray the closing scenes\nof the greatest life of antiquity would never have been written.\nBut the mere fact that such a man lived and taught in the way\nthat he did goes far in proof of the deep culture of the Athenian\npublic. Further confirmation is to be found in the fact that such\ntragedies as the Antigone, the Oidipous, and the Prometheus were\nwritten to suit the popular taste of the time; not to be read by\nliterary people, or to be performed before select audiences such\nas in our day listen to Ristori or Janauschek, but to hold\nspell-bound that vast concourse of all kinds of people which\nassembled at the Dionysiac festivals.",
        "Still further proof is furnished by the exquisite literary\nperfection of Greek writings. One of the common arguments in\nfavour of the study of Greek at the present day is based upon the\nopinion that in the best works extant in that language the art of\nliterary expression has reached wellnigh absolute perfection. I\nfully concur in this opinion, so far as to doubt if even the\ngreatest modern writers, even a Pascal or a Voltaire, can fairly\nsustain a comparison with such Athenians as Plato or Lysias. This\nexcellence of the ancient books is in part immediately due to the\nfact that they were not written in a hurry, or amid the anxieties\nof an over-busy existence; but it is in greater part due to the\nindirect consequences of a leisurely life. These books were\nwritten for a public which knew well how to appreciate the finer\nbeauties of expression; and, what is still more to the point,\ntheir authors lived in a community where an elegant style was\nhabitual. Before a matchless style can be written, there must be\na good style “in the air,” as the French say. Probably the most\nfinished talking and writing of modern times has been done in and\nabout the French court in the seventeenth century; and it is\naccordingly there that we find men like Pascal and Bossuet\nwriting a prose which for precision, purity, and dignity has\nnever since been surpassed. It is thus that the unapproachable\nliterary excellence of ancient Greek books speaks for the genuine\nculture of the people who were expected to read them, or to hear\nthem read. For one of the surest indices of true culture, whether\nprofessedly literary or not, is the power to express one’s self\nin precise, rhythmical, and dignified language. We hardly need a\nbetter evidence than this of the superiority of the ancient\ncommunity in the general elevation of its tastes and perceptions.\nRecollecting how Herodotos read his history at the Olympic games,\nlet us try to imagine even so picturesque a writer as Mr. Parkman\nreading a few chapters of his “Jesuits in North America” before\nthe spectators assembled at the Jerome Park races, and we shall\nthe better realize how deep-seated was Hellenic culture.",
        "As yet, however, I have referred to but one side of Athenian\nlife. Though “seekers after wisdom,” the cultivated people of\nAthens did not spend all their valuable leisure in dialectics or\nin connoisseurship. They were not a set of dilettanti or dreamy\nphilosophers, and they were far from subordinating the material\nside of life to the intellectual. Also, though they dealt not in\nmoney-making after the eager fashion of modern men, they had\nstill concerns of immediate practical interest with which to busy\nthemselves. Each one of these twenty-five thousand free Athenians\nwas not only a free voter, but an office-holder, a legislator, a\njudge. They did not control the government through a\nrepresentative body, but they were themselves the government.\nThey were, one and all, in turn liable to be called upon to make\nlaws, and to execute them after they were made, as well as to\nadminister justice in civil and criminal suits. The affairs and\ninterests, not only of their own city, but of a score or two of\nscattered dependencies, were more or less closely to be looked\nafter by them. It lay with them to declare war, to carry it on\nafter declaring it, and to pay the expenses of it. Actually and\nnot by deputy they administered the government of their own city,\nboth in its local and in its imperial relations. All this implies\na more thorough, more constant, and more vital political training\nthan that which is implied by the modern duties of casting a\nballot and serving on a jury. The life of the Athenian was\nemphatically a political life. From early manhood onward, it was\npart of his duty to hear legal questions argued by powerful\nadvocates, and to utter a decision upon law and fact; or to mix\nin debate upon questions of public policy, arguing, listening,\nand pondering. It is customary to compare the political talent of\nthe Greeks unfavourably with that displayed by the Romans, and I\nhave no wish to dispute this estimate. But on a careful study it\nwill appear that the Athenians, at least, in a higher degree than\nany other community of ancient times, exhibited parliamentary\ntact, or the ability to sit still while both sides of a question\nare getting discussed,—that sort of political talent for which\nthe English races are distinguished, and to the lack of which so\nmany of the political failures of the French are egregiously due.\nOne would suppose that a judicature of the whole town would be\nlikely to execute a sorry parody of justice; yet justice was by\nno means ill-administered at Athens. Even the most unfortunate\nand disgraceful scenes,—as where the proposed massacre of the\nMytilenaians was discussed, and where summary retribution was\ndealt out to the generals who had neglected their duty at\nArginusai,—even these scenes furnish, when thoroughly examined,\nas by Mr. Grote, only the more convincing proof that the Athenian\nwas usually swayed by sound reason and good sense to an\nextraordinary degree. All great points in fact, were settled\nrather by sober appeals to reason than by intrigue or lobbying;\nand one cannot help thinking that an Athenian of the time of\nPerikles would have regarded with pitying contempt the trick of\nthe “previous question.” And this explains the undoubted\npre-eminence of Athenian oratory. This accounts for the fact that\nwe find in the forensic annals of a single city, and within the\ncompass of a single century, such names as Lysias, Isokrates,\nAndokides, Hypereides, Aischines, and Demosthenes. The art of\noratory, like the art of sculpture, shone forth more brilliantly\nthen than ever since, because then the conditions favouring its\ndevelopment were more perfectly combined than they have since\nbeen. Now, a condition of society in which the multitude can\nalways be made to stand quietly and listen to a logical discourse\nis a condition of high culture. Readers of Xenophon’s Anabasis\nwill remember the frequency of the speeches in that charming\nbook. Whenever some terrible emergency arose, or some alarming\nquarrel or disheartening panic occurred, in the course of the\nretreat of the Ten Thousand, an oration from one of the\ncommanders—not a demagogue’s appeal to the lower passions, but a\ncalm exposition of circumstances addressed to the sober\njudgment—usually sufficed to set all things in order. To my mind\nthis is one of the most impressive historical lessons conveyed in\nXenophon’s book. And this peculiar kind of self-control,\nindicative of intellectual sobriety and high moral training,\nwhich was more or less characteristic of all Greeks, was\nespecially characteristic of the Athenians.",
        "These illustrations will, I hope, suffice to show that there is\nnothing extravagant in the high estimate which I have made of\nAthenian culture. I have barely indicated the causes of this\nsingular perfection of individual training in the social\ncircumstances amid which the Athenians lived. I have alleged it\nas an instance of what may be accomplished by a well-directed\nleisure and in the absence or very scanty development of such a\ncomplex industrial life as that which surrounds us to-day. But I\nhave not yet quite done with the Athenians. Before leaving this\npart of the subject, I must mention one further circumstance\nwhich tends to make ancient life appear in our eyes more sunny\nand healthy and less distressed, than the life of modern times.\nAnd in this instance, too, though we are not dealing with any\nimmediate or remote effects of leisureliness, we still have to\nnote the peculiar advantage gained by the absence of a great\ncomplexity of interests in the ancient community.",
        "With respect to religion, the Athenians were peculiarly situated.\nThey had for the most part outgrown the primitive terrorism of\nfetishistic belief. Save in cases of public distress, as in the\nmutilation of the Hermai, or in the refusal of Nikias to retreat\nfrom Syracuse because of an eclipse of the moon, they were no\nlonger, like savages, afraid of the dark. Their keen aesthetic\nsense had prevailed to turn the horrors of a primeval\nnature-worship into beauties. Their springs and groves were\npeopled by their fancy with naiads and dryads, not with trolls\nand grotesque goblins. Their feelings toward the unseen powers at\nwork about them were in the main pleasant; as witness the little\nstory about Pheidippides meeting the god Pan as he was making\nwith hot haste toward Sparta to announce the arrival of the\nPersians. Now, while this original source of mental discomfort,\nwhich afflicts the uncivilized man, had ceased materially to\naffect the Athenians, they on the other hand lived at a time when\nthe vague sense of sin and self-reproof which was characteristic\nof the early ages of Christianity, had not yet invaded society.\nThe vast complication of life brought about by the extension of\nthe Roman Empire led to a great development of human sympathies,\nunknown in earlier times, and called forth unquiet yearnings,\ndesire for amelioration, a sense of short-coming, and a morbid\nself-consciousness. It is accordingly under Roman sway that we\nfirst come across characters approximating to the modern type,\nlike Cicero, Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. It is then\nthat we find the idea of social progress first clearly expressed,\nthat we discover some glimmerings of a conscious philanthropy,\nand that we detect the earliest symptoms of that unhealthy\ntendency to subordinate too entirely the physical to the moral\nlife, which reached its culmination in the Middle Ages. In the\npalmy days of the Athenians it was different. When we hint that\nthey were not consciously philanthropists, we do not mean that\nthey were not humane; when we accredit them with no idea of\nprogress, we do not forget how much they did to render both the\nidea and the reality possible; when we say that they had not a\ndistressing sense of spiritual unworthiness, we do not mean that\nthey had no conscience. We mean that their moral and religious\nlife sat easily on them, like their own graceful drapery,—did\nnot gall and worry them, like the hair-cloth garment of the monk.\nThey were free from that dark conception of a devil which lent\nterror to life in the Middle Ages; and the morbid\nself-consciousness which led mediaeval women to immure themselves\nin convents would have been to an Athenian quite inexplicable.\nThey had, in short, an open and childlike conception of religion;\nand, as such, it was a sunny conception. Any one who will take\nthe trouble to compare an idyl of Theokritos with a modern\npastoral, or the poem of Kleanthes with a modern hymn, or the\nAphrodite of Melos with a modern Madonna, will realize most\neffectually what I mean.",
        "And, finally, the religion of the Athenians was in the main\nsymbolized in a fluctuating mythology, and had never been\nhardened into dogmas. The Athenian was subject to no priest, nor\nwas he obliged to pin his faith to any formulated creed. His\nhospitable polytheism left little room for theological\npersecution, and none for any heresy short of virtual atheism.\nThe feverish doubts which rack the modern mind left him\nundisturbed. Though he might sink to any depth of scepticism in\nphilosophy, yet the eternal welfare of his soul was not supposed\nto hang upon the issue of his doubts. Accordingly Athenian\nsociety was not only characterized in the main by freedom of\nopinion, in spite of the exceptional cases of Anaxagoras and\nSokrates; but there was also none of that Gothic gloom with which\nthe deep-seated Christian sense of infinite responsibility for\nopinion has saddened modern religious life.",
        "In these reflections I have wandered a little way from my\nprincipal theme, in order more fully to show why the old Greek\nlife impresses us as so cheerful. Returning now to the keynote\nwith which we started, let us state succinctly the net result of\nwhat has been said about the Athenians. As a people we have seen\nthat they enjoyed an unparalleled amount of leisure, living\nthrough life with but little turmoil and clatter. Their life was\nmore spontaneous and unrestrained, less rigorously marked out by\nuncontrollable circumstances, than the life of moderns. They did\nnot run so much in grooves. And along with this we have seen\nreason to believe that they were the most profoundly cultivated\nof all peoples; that a larger proportion of men lived complete,\nwell-rounded, harmonious lives in ancient Athens than in any\nother known community. Keen, nimble-minded, and self-possessed;\naudacious speculators, but temperate and averse to extravagance;\nemotionally healthy, and endowed with an unequalled sense of\nbeauty and propriety; how admirable and wonderful they seem when\nlooked at across the gulf of ages intervening,—and what a\npriceless possession to humanity, of what noble augury for the\ndistant future, is the fact that such a society has once existed!",
        "The lesson to be drawn from the study of this antique life will\nimpress itself more deeply upon us after we have briefly\ncontemplated the striking contrast to it which is afforded by the\nphase of civilization amid which we live to-day. Ever since Greek\ncivilization was merged in Roman imperialism, there has been a\nslowly growing tendency toward complexity of social life,—toward\nthe widening of sympathies, the multiplying of interests, the\nincrease of the number of things to be done. Through the later\nMiddle Ages, after Roman civilization had absorbed and\ndisciplined the incoming barbarism which had threatened to\ndestroy it, there was a steadily increasing complication of\nsociety, a multiplication of the wants of life, and a consequent\nenhancement of the difficulty of self-maintenance. The ultimate\ncauses of this phenomenon lie so far beneath the surface that\nthey could be satisfactorily discussed only in a technical essay\non the evolution of society. It will be enough for us here to\nobserve that the great geographical discoveries of the sixteenth\ncentury and the somewhat later achievements of physical science\nhave, during the past two hundred years, aided powerfully in\ndetermining the entrance of the Western world upon an industrial\nepoch,—an epoch which has for its final object the complete\nsubjection of the powers of nature to purposes of individual\ncomfort and happiness. We have now to trace some of the effects\nof this lately-begun industrial development upon social life and\nindividual culture. And as we studied the leisureliness of\nantiquity where its effects were most conspicuous, in the city of\nAthens, we shall now do well to study the opposite\ncharacteristics of modern society where they are most\nconspicuously exemplified, in our own country. The attributes of\nAmerican life which it will be necessary to signalize will be\nseen to be only the attributes of modern life in their most\nexaggerated phase.",
        "To begin with, in studying the United States, we are no longer\ndealing with a single city, or with small groups of cities. The\ncity as a political unit, in the antique sense, has never existed\namong us, and indeed can hardly be said now to exist anywhere.\nThe modern city is hardly more than a great emporium of trade, or\na place where large numbers of people find it convenient to live\nhuddled together; not a sacred fatherland to which its\ninhabitants owe their highest allegiance, and by the requirements\nof which their political activity is limited. What strikes us\nhere is that our modern life is diffused or spread out, not\nconcentrated like the ancient civic life. If the Athenian had\nbeen the member of an integral community, comprising all\npeninsular Greece and the mainland of Asia Minor, he could not\nhave taken life so easily as he did.",
        "Now our country is not only a very large one, but compared to its\nvast territorial extent it contains a very small population. If\nwe go on increasing at the present rate, so that a century hence\nwe number four or five hundred millions, our country will be\nhardly more crowded than China is to-day. Or if our whole\npopulation were now to be brought east of Niagara Falls, and\nconfined on the south by the Potomac, we should still have as\nmuch elbow-room as they have in France. Political economists can\nshow the effects of this high ratio of land to inhabitants, in\nincreasing wages, raising the interest of money, and stimulating\nproduction. We are thus living amid circumstances which are\ngoading the industrial activity characteristic of the last two\ncenturies, and notably of the English race, into an almost\nfeverish energy. The vast extent of our unwrought territory is\nconstantly draining fresh life from our older districts, to aid\nin the establishment of new frontier communities of a somewhat\nlower or less highly organized type. And these younger\ncommunities, daily springing up, are constantly striving to take\non the higher structure,—to become as highly civilized and to\nenjoy as many of the prerogatives of civilization as the rest.\nAll this calls forth an enormous quantity of activity, and causes\nAmerican life to assume the aspect of a life-and-death struggle\nfor mastery over the material forces of that part of the earth’s\nsurface upon which it thrives.",
        "It is thus that we are traversing what may properly be called the\nBARBAROUS epoch of our history,—the epoch at which the\npredominant intellectual activity is employed in achievements\nwhich are mainly of a material character. Military barbarism, or\nthe inability of communities to live together without frequent\nwarfare, has been nearly outgrown by the whole Western world.\nPrivate wars, long since made everywhere illegal, have nearly\nceased; and public wars, once continual, have become infrequent.\nBut industrial barbarism, by which I mean the inability of a\ncommunity to direct a portion of its time to purposes of\nspiritual life, after providing for its physical\nmaintenance,—this kind of barbarism the modern world has by no\nmeans outgrown. To-day, the great work of life is to live; while\nthe amount of labour consumed in living has throughout the\npresent century been rapidly increasing. Nearly the whole of this\nAmerican community toils from youth to old age in merely\nprocuring the means for satisfying the transient wants of life.\nOur time and energies, our spirit and buoyancy, are quite used up\nin what is called “getting on.”",
        "Another point of difference between the structure of American and\nof Athenian society must not be left out of the account. The time\nhas gone by in which the energies of a hundred thousand men and\nwomen could be employed in ministering to the individual\nperfection of twenty-five thousand. Slavery, in the antique\nsense,—an absolute command of brain as well as of muscle, a\nslave-system of skilled labour,—we have never had. In our day it\nis for each man to earn his own bread; so that the struggle for\nexistence has become universal. The work of one class does not\nfurnish leisure for another class. The exceptional circumstances\nwhich freed the Athenian from industrial barbarism, and enabled\nhim to become the great teacher and model of culture for the\nhuman race, have disappeared forever.",
        "Then the general standard of comfortable living, as already\nhinted, has been greatly raised, and is still rising. What would\nhave satisfied the ancient would seem to us like penury. We have\na domestic life of which the Greek knew nothing. We live during a\nlarge part of the year in the house. Our social life goes on\nunder the roof. Our houses are not mere places for eating and\nsleeping, like the houses of the ancients. It therefore costs us\na large amount of toil to get what is called shelter for our\nheads. The sum which a young married man, in “good society,” has\nto pay for his house and the furniture contained in it, would\nhave enabled an Athenian to live in princely leisure from youth\nto old age. The sum which he has to pay out each year, to meet\nthe complicated expense of living in such a house, would have\nmore than sufficed to bring up an Athenian family. If worthy\nStrepsiades could have got an Asmodean glimpse of Fifth Avenue,\nor even of some unpretending street in Cambridge, he might have\ngone back to his aristocratic wife a sadder but a more contented\nman.",
        "Wealth—or at least what would until lately have been called\nwealth—has become essential to comfort; while the opportunities\nfor acquiring it have in recent times been immensely multiplied.\nTo get money is, therefore, the chief end of life in our time and\ncountry. “Success in life” has become synonymous with “becoming\nwealthy.” A man who is successful in what he undertakes is a man\nwho makes his employment pay him in money. Our normal type of\ncharacter is that of the shrewd, circumspect business man; as in\nthe Middle Ages it was that of the hardy warrior. And as in those\ndays when fighting was a constant necessity, and when the only\nhonourable way for a gentleman of high rank to make money was by\nfreebooting, fighting came to be regarded as an end desirable in\nitself; so in these days the mere effort to accumulate has become\na source of enjoyment rather than a means to it. The same truth\nis to be witnessed in aberrant types of character. The infatuated\nspeculator and the close-fisted millionaire are our substitutes\nfor the mediaeval berserkir,—the man who loved the pell-mell of\na contest so well that he would make war on his neighbour, just\nto keep his hand in. In like manner, while such crimes as murder\nand violent robbery have diminished in frequency during the past\ncentury, on the other hand such crimes as embezzlement, gambling\nin stocks, adulteration of goods, and using of false weights and\nmeasures, have probably increased. If Dick Turpin were now to be\nbrought back to life, he would find the New York Custom-House a\nmore congenial and profitable working-place than the king’s\nhighway.",
        "The result of this universal quest for money is that we are\nalways in a hurry. Our lives pass by in a whirl. It is all labour\nand no fruition. We work till we are weary; we carry our work\nhome with us; it haunts our evenings, and disturbs our sleep as\nwell as our digestion. Our minds are so burdened with it that our\nconversation, when serious, can dwell upon little else. If we\nstep into a railway-car, or the smoking-room of a hotel, or any\nother place where a dozen or two of men are gathered together, we\nshall hear them talking of stocks, of investments, of commercial\npaper, as if there were really nothing in this universe worth\nthinking of, save only the interchange of dollars and\ncommodities. So constant and unremitted is our forced\napplication, that our minds are dwarfed for everything except the\nprosecution of the one universal pursuit.",
        "Are we now prepared for the completing of the contrast? Must we\nsay that, as Athens was the most leisurely and the United States\nis the most hurried community known in history, so the Americans\nare, as a consequence of their hurry, lacking in thoroughness of\nculture? Or, since it is difficult to bring our modern culture\ndirectly into contrast with that of an ancient community, let me\nstate the case after a different but equivalent fashion. Since\nthe United States present only an exaggerated type of the modern\nindustrial community, since the turmoil of incessant\nmoney-getting, which affects all modern communities in large\nmeasure, affects us most seriously of all, shall it be said that\nwe are, on the whole, less highly cultivated than our\ncontemporaries in Western Europe? To a certain extent we must\nconfess that this is the case. In the higher culture—in the\nculture of the whole man, according to the antique idea—we are\nundoubtedly behind all other nations with which it would be fair\nto compare ourselves. It will not do to decide a question like\nthis merely by counting literary celebrities, although even thus\nwe should by no means get a verdict in our favour. Since the\nbeginning of this century, England has produced as many great\nwriters and thinkers as France or Germany; yet the general status\nof culture in England is said—perhaps with truth—to be lower\nthan it is in these countries. It is said that the average\nEnglishman is less ready than the average German or Frenchman to\nsympathize with ideas which have no obvious market-value. Yet in\nEngland there is an amount of high culture among those not\nprofessionally scholars, which it would be vain to seek among\nourselves. The purposes of my argument, however, require that the\ncomparison should be made between our own country and Western\nEurope in general. Compare, then, our best magazines—not solely\nwith regard to their intrinsic excellence, but also with regard\nto the way in which they are sustained—with the Revue des Deux\nMondes or the Journal des Debats. Or compare our leading\npoliticians with men like Gladstone, Disraeli, or Sir G. C.\nLewis; or even with such men as Brougham or Thiers. Or compare\nthe slovenly style of our newspaper articles, I will not say with\nthe exquisite prose of the lamented Prevost-Paradol, but with the\nordinary prose of the French or English newspaper. But a far\nbetter illustration—for it goes down to the root of things—is\nsuggested by the recent work of Matthew Arnold on the schools of\nthe continent of Europe. The country of our time where the\ngeneral culture is unquestionably the highest is Prussia. Now, in\nPrussia, they are able to have a Minister of Education, who is a\nmember of the Cabinet. They are sure that this minister will not\nappoint or remove even an assistant professor for political\nreasons. Only once, as Arnold tells us, has such a thing been\ndone; and then public opinion expressed itself in such an\nemphatic tone of disapproval that the displaced teacher was\ninstantly appointed to another position. Nothing of this sort,\nsays Arnold, could have occurred in England; but still less could\nit occur in America. Had we such an educational system, there\nwould presently be an “Education Ring” to control it. Nor can\nthis difference be ascribed to the less eager political activity\nof Germany. The Prussian state of things would have been possible\nin ancient Athens, where political life was as absorbing and\nnearly as turbulent as in the United States. The difference is\ndue to our lack of faith in culture, a lack of faith in that of\nwhich we have not had adequate experience.",
        "We lack culture because we live in a hurry, and because our\nattention is given up to pursuits which call into activity and\ndevelop but one side of us. On the one hand contemplate Sokrates\nquietly entertaining a crowd in the Athenian market-place, and on\nthe other hand consider Broadway with its eternal clatter, and\nits throngs of hurrying people elbowing and treading on each\nother’s heels, and you will get a lively notion of the difference\nbetween the extreme phases of ancient and modern life. By the\ntime we have thus rushed through our day, we have no strength\nleft to devote to things spiritual. To-day finds us no nearer\nfruition than yesterday. And if perhaps the time at last arrives\nwhen fruition is practicable, our minds have run so long in the\nruts that they cannot be twisted out.",
        "As it is impossible for any person living in a given state of\nsociety to keep himself exempt from its influences, detrimental\nas well as beneficial, we find that even those who strive to make\na literary occupation subservient to purposes of culture are not,\nsave in rare cases, spared by the general turmoil. Those who have\nat once the ability, the taste, and the wealth needful for\ntraining themselves to the accomplishment of some many-sided and\npermanent work are of course very few. Nor have our universities\nyet provided themselves with the means for securing to literary\ntalent the leisure which is essential to complete mental\ndevelopment, or to a high order of productiveness. Although in\nmost industrial enterprises we know how to work together so\nsuccessfully, in literature we have as yet no co-operation. We\nhave not only no Paris, but we have not even a Tubingen, a\nLeipsic, or a Jena, or anything corresponding to the fellowships\nin the English universities. Our literary workers have no choice\nbut to fall into the ranks, and make merchandise of their\nhalf-formed ideas. They must work without co-operation, they must\nwrite in a hurry, and they must write for those who have no\nleisure for aught but hasty and superficial reading.",
        "Bursting boilers and custom-house frauds may have at first sight\nnothing to do with each other or with my subject. It is\nindisputable, however, that the horrible massacres perpetrated\nevery few weeks or mouths by our common carriers, and the\ndisgraceful peculation in which we allow our public servants to\nindulge with hardly ever an effective word of protest, are alike\nto be ascribed to the same causes which interfere with our higher\nculture. It is by no means a mere accidental coincidence that for\nevery dollar stolen by government officials in Prussia, at least\nfifty or a hundred are stolen in the United States. This does not\nshow that the Germans are our superiors in average honesty, but\nit shows that they are our superiors in thoroughness. It is with\nthem an imperative demand that any official whatever shall be\nqualified for his post; a principle of public economy which in\nour country is not simply ignored in practice, but often openly\nlaughed at. But in a country where high intelligence and thorough\ntraining are imperatively demanded, it follows of necessity that\nthese qualifications must insure for their possessors a permanent\ncareer in which the temptations to malfeasance or dishonesty are\nreduced to the minimum. On the other hand, in a country where\nintelligence and training have no surety that they are to carry\nthe day against stupidity and inefficiency, the incentives to\ndishonourable conduct are overpowering. The result in our own\npolitical life is that the best men are driven in disgust from\npolitics, and thus one of the noblest fields for the culture of\nthe whole man is given over to be worked by swindlers and\ncharlatans. To an Athenian such a severance of the highest\nculture from political life would have been utterly\ninconceivable. Obviously the deepest explanation of all this lies\nin our lack of belief in the necessity for high and thorough\ntraining. We do not value culture enough to keep it in our employ\nor to pay it for its services; and what is this short-sighted\nnegligence but the outcome of the universal shiftlessness\nbegotten of the habit of doing everything in a hurry? On every\nhand we may see the fruits of this shiftlessness, from buildings\nthat tumble in, switches that are misplaced, furnaces that are\nill-protected, fire-brigades that are without discipline, up to\nunauthorized meddlings with the currency, and revenue laws which\ndefeat their own purpose.",
        "I said above that the attributes of American life which we should\nfind it necessary for our purpose to signalize are simply the\nattributes of modern life in their most exaggerated phase. Is\nthere not a certain sense in which all modern handiwork is\nhastily and imperfectly done? To begin with common household\narts, does not every one know that old things are more durable\nthan new things? Our grandfathers wore better shoes than we wear,\nbecause there was leisure enough to cure the leather properly. In\nold times a chair was made of seasoned wood, and its joints\ncarefully fitted; its maker had leisure to see that it was well\nput together. Now a thousand are turned off at once by machinery,\nout of green wood, and, with their backs glued on, are hurried\noff to their evil fate,—destined to drop in pieces if they\nhappen to stand near the fireplace, and liable to collapse under\nthe weight of a heavy man. Some of us still preserve, as\nheirlooms, old tables and bedsteads of Cromwellian times: in the\ntwenty-first century what will have become of our machine-made\nbedsteads and tables?",
        "Perhaps it may seem odd to talk about tanning and joinery in\nconnection with culture, but indeed there is a subtle bond of\nunion holding together all these things. Any phase of life can be\nunderstood only by associating with it some different phase.\nSokrates himself has taught us how the homely things illustrate\nthe grand things. If we turn to the art of musical composition\nand inquire into some of the differences between our recent music\nand that of Handel’s time, we shall alight upon the very\ncriticism which Mr. Mill somewhere makes in comparing ancient\nwith modern literature: the substance has improved, but the form\nhas in some respects deteriorated. The modern music expresses the\nresults of a richer and more varied emotional experience, and in\nwealth of harmonic resources, to say nothing of increased skill\nin orchestration, it is notably superior to the old music. Along\nwith this advance, however, there is a perceptible falling off in\nsymmetry and completeness of design, and in what I would call\nspontaneousness of composition. I believe that this is because\nmodern composers, as a rule, do not drudge patiently enough upon\ncounterpoint. They do not get that absolute mastery over\ntechnical difficulties of figuration which was the great secret\nof the incredible facility and spontaneity of composition\ndisplayed by Handel and Bach. Among recent musicians Mendelssohn\nis the most thoroughly disciplined in the elements of\ncounterpoint; and it is this perfect mastery of the technique of\nhis art which has enabled him to outrank Schubert and Schumann,\nneither of whom would one venture to pronounce inferior to him in\nnative wealth of musical ideas. May we not partly attribute to\nrudimentary deficiency in counterpoint the irregularity of\nstructure which so often disfigures the works of the great Wagner\nand the lesser Liszt, and which the more ardent admirers of these\ncomposers are inclined to regard as a symptom of progress?",
        "I am told that a similar illustration might be drawn from the\nmodern history of painting; that, however noble the conceptions\nof the great painters of the present century, there are none who\nhave gained such a complete mastery over the technicalities of\ndrawing and the handling of the brush as was required in the\ntimes of Raphael, Titian, and Rubens. But on this point I can\nonly speak from hearsay, and am quite willing to end here my\nseries of illustrations, fearing that I may already have been\nwrongly set down as a lavulator temporis acti. Not the idle\npraising of times gone by, but the getting a lesson from them\nwhich may be of use to us, has been my object. And I believe\nenough has been said to show that the great complexity of modern\nlife, with its multiplicity of demands upon our energy, has got\nus into a state of chronic hurry, the results of which are\neverywhere to be seen in the shape of less thorough workmanship\nand less rounded culture.",
        "For one moment let me stop to note a further source of the\nrelative imperfection of modern culture, which is best\nillustrated in the case of literature. I allude to the immense,\nunorganized mass of literature in all departments, representing\nthe accumulated acquisitions of past ages, which must form the\nbasis of our own achievement, but with which our present methods\nof education seem inadequate to deal properly. Speaking roughly,\nmodern literature may be said to be getting into the state which\nRoman jurisprudence was in before it was reformed by Justinian.\nPhilosophic criticism has not yet reached the point at which it\nmay serve as a natural codifier. We must read laboriously and\nexpend a disproportionate amount of time and pains in winnowing\nthe chaff from the wheat. This tends to make us “digs” or\nliterary drudges; but I doubt if the “dig” is a thoroughly\ndeveloped man. Goethe, with all his boundless knowledge, his\nuniversal curiosity, and his admirable capacity for work, was not\na “dig.” But this matter can only be hinted at: it is too large\nto be well discussed at the fag end of an essay while other\npoints are pressing for consideration.",
        "A state of chronic hurry not only directly hinders the\nperformance of thorough work, but it has an indirect tendency to\nblunt the enjoyment of life. Let us consider for a moment one of\nthe psychological consequences entailed by the strain of a too\ncomplex and rapid activity. Every one must have observed that in\ngoing off for a vacation of two or three weeks, or in getting\nfreed in any way from the ruts of every-day life, time slackens\nits gait somewhat, and the events which occur are apt a few years\nlater to cover a disproportionately large area in our\nrecollections. This is because the human organism is a natural\ntimepiece in which the ticks are conscious sensations. The\ngreater the number of sensations which occupy the foreground of\nconsciousness during the day, the longer the day seems in the\nretrospect. But the various groups of sensations which accompany\nour daily work tend to become automatic from continual\nrepetition, and to sink into the background of consciousness; and\nin a very complex and busied life the number of sensations or\nstates of consciousness which can struggle up to the front and\nget attended to, is comparatively small It is thus that the days\nseem so short when we are busy about every-day matters, and that\nthey get blurred together, and as it were individually\nannihilated in recollection. When we travel, a comparatively\nlarge number of fresh sensations occupy attention, there is a\nmaximum of consciousness, and a distinct image is left to loom up\nin memory. For the same reason the weeks and years are much\nlonger to the child than to the grown man. The life is simpler\nand less hurried, so that there is time to attend to a great many\nsensations. Now this fact lies at the bottom of that keen\nenjoyment of existence which is the prerogative of childhood and\nearly youth. The day is not rushed through by the automatic\ndischarge of certain psychical functions, but each sensation\nstays long enough to make itself recognized. Now when once we\nunderstand the psychology of this matter, it becomes evident that\nthe same contrast that holds between the child and the man must\nhold also between the ancient and the modern. The number of\nelements entering into ancient life were so few relatively, that\nthere must have been far more than there is now of that intense\nrealization of life which we can observe in children and remember\nof our own childhood. Space permitting, it would be easy to show\nfrom Greek literature how intense was this realization of life.\nBut my point will already have been sufficiently apprehended.\nAlready we cannot fail to see how difficult it is to get more\nthan a minimum of conscious fruition out of a too complex and\nrapid activity.",
        "One other point is worth noticing before we close. How is this\nturmoil of modern existence impressing itself upon the physical\nconstitutions of modern men and women? When an individual man\nengages in furious productive activity, his friends warn him that\nhe will break down. Does the collective man of our time need some\nsuch friendly warning? Let us first get a hint from what\nforeigners think of us ultra-modernized Americans. Wandering\njournalists, of an ethnological turn of mind, who visit these\nshores, profess to be struck with the slenderness, the apparent\nlack of toughness, the dyspeptic look, of the American physique.\nAnd from such observations it has been seriously argued that the\nstalwart English race is suffering inevitable degeneracy in this\nforeign climate. I have even seen it doubted whether a race of\nmen can ever become thoroughly naturalized in a locality to which\nit is not indigenous. To such vagaries it is a sufficient answer\nthat the English are no more indigenous to England than to\nAmerica. They are indigenous to Central Asia, and as they have\nsurvived the first transplantation, they may be safely counted on\nto survive the second. A more careful survey will teach us that\nthe slow alteration of physique which is going on in this country\nis only an exaggeration of that which modern civilization is\ntending to bring about everywhere. It is caused by the premature\nand excessive strain upon the mental powers requisite to meet the\nemergencies of our complex life. The progress of events has\nthrown the work of sustaining life so largely upon the brain that\nwe are beginning to sacrifice the physical to the intellectual.\nWe are growing spirituelle in appearance at the expense of\nrobustness. Compare any typical Greek face, with its firm\nmuscles, its symmetry of feature, and its serenity of expression,\nto a typical modern portrait, with its more delicate contour, its\nexaggerated forehead, its thoughtful, perhaps jaded look. Or\nconsider in what respects the grand faces of the Plantagenet\nmonarchs differ from the refined countenances of the leading\nEnglish statesmen of to-day. Or again, consider the familiar\npictures of the Oxford and Harvard crews which rowed a race on\nthe Thames in 1869, and observe how much less youthful are the\nfaces of the Americans. By contrast they almost look careworn.\nThe summing up of countless such facts is that modern\ncivilization is making us nervous. Our most formidable diseases\nare of nervous origin. We seem to have got rid of the mediaeval\nplague and many of its typhoid congeners; but instead we have an\nincreased amount of insanity, methomania, consumption, dyspepsia,\nand paralysis. In this fact it is plainly written that we are\nsuffering physically from the over-work and over-excitement\nentailed by excessive hurry.",
        "In view of these various but nearly related points of difference\nbetween ancient and modern life as studied in their extreme\nmanifestations, it cannot be denied that while we have gained\nmuch, we have also lost a good deal that is valuable, in our\nprogress. We cannot but suspect that we are not in all points\nmore highly favoured than the ancients. And it becomes probable\nthat Athens, at all events, which I have chosen as my example,\nmay have exhibited an adumbration of a state of things which, for\nthe world at large, is still in the future,—still to be remotely\nhoped for. The rich complexity of modern social achievement is\nattained at the cost of individual many-sidedness. As Tennyson\nputs it, “The individual withers and the world is more and more.\"\nYet the individual does not exist for the sake of society, as the\npositivists would have us believe, but society exists for the\nsake of the individual. And the test of complete social life is\nthe opportunity which it affords for complete individual life.\nTried by this test, our contemporary civilization will appear\nseriously defective,—excellent only as a preparation for\nsomething better.",
        "This is the true light in which to regard it. This incessant\nturmoil, this rage for accumulation of wealth, this crowding,\njostling, and trampling upon one another, cannot be regarded as\npermanent, or as anything more than the accompaniment of a\ntransitional stage of civilization. There must be a limit to the\nextent to which the standard of comfortable living can be raised.\nThe industrial organization of society, which is now but\nbeginning, must culminate in a state of things in which the means\nof expense will exceed the demand for expense, in which the human\nrace will have some surplus capital. The incessant manual labour\nwhich the ancients relegated to slaves will in course of time be\nmore and more largely performed by inanimate machinery. Unskilled\nlabour will for the most part disappear. Skilled labour will\nconsist in the guiding of implements contrived with versatile\ncunning for the relief of human nerve and muscle. Ultimately\nthere will be no unsettled land to fill, no frontier life, no\nsavage races to be assimilated or extirpated, no extensive\nmigration. Thus life will again become comparatively stationary.\nThe chances for making great fortunes quickly will be diminished,\nwhile the facilities for acquiring a competence by steady labour\nwill be increased. When every one is able to reach the normal\nstandard of comfortable living, we must suppose that the\nexaggerated appetite for wealth and display will gradually\ndisappear. We shall be more easily satisfied, and thus enjoy more\nleisure. It may be that there will ultimately exist, over the\ncivilized world, conditions as favourable to the complete\nfruition of life as those which formerly existed within the\nnarrow circuit of Attika; save that the part once played by\nenslaved human brain and muscle will finally be played by the\nenslaved forces of insentient nature. Society will at last bear\nthe test of providing for the complete development of its\nindividual members.",
        "So, at least, we may hope; such is the probability which the\nprogress of events, when carefully questioned, sketches out for\nus. “Need we fear,” asks Mr. Greg, “that the world would stagnate\nunder such a change? Need we guard ourselves against the\nmisconstruction of being held to recommend a life of complacent\nand inglorious inaction? We think not. We would only substitute a\nnobler for a meaner strife,—a rational for an excessive\ntoil,—an enjoyment that springs from serenity, for one that\nsprings from excitement only. . . . . To each time its own\npreacher, to each excess its own counteraction. In an age of\ndissipation, languor, and stagnation, we should join with Mr.\nCarlyle in preaching the ’Evangel of Work,’ and say with him,\n’Blessed is the man who has found his work,—let him ask no other\nblessedness.’ In an age of strenuous, frenzied, .... and often\nutterly irrational and objectless exertion, we join Mr. Mill in\npreaching the milder and more needed ’Evangel of Leisure.’ “",
        "Bearing all these things in mind, we may understand the remark of\nthe supremely cultivated Goethe, when asked who were his masters:\nDie Griechen, die Griechen, und immer die Griechen. We may\nappreciate the significance of Mr. Mill’s argument in favour of\nthe study of antiquity, that it preserves the tradition of an era\nof individual completeness. There is a disposition growing among\nus to remodel our methods of education in conformity with the\ntemporary requirements of the age in which we live. In this\nendeavour there is much that is wise and practical; but in so far\nas it tends to the neglect of antiquity, I cannot think it\nwell-timed. Our education should not only enhance the value of\nwhat we possess; is should also supply the consciousness of what\nwe lack. And while, for generations to come, we pass toilfully\nthrough an era of exorbitant industrialism, some fragment of our\ntime will not be misspent in keeping alive the tradition of a\nstate of things which was once briefly enjoyed by a little\ncommunity, but which, in the distant future, will, as it is\nhoped, become the permanent possession of all mankind.",
