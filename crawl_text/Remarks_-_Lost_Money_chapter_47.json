        "Most anyone could collect and tell a good many incidents about lost money\nthat has been found, if he would try, but these cases came under my own\nobservation and I can vouch for their truth.",
        "A farmer in the Kinnekinnick Valley was paid $1,000 while he was loading\nhay. He put it in his vest pocket, and after he had unloaded the hay he\ndiscovered that he had lost it, and no doubt had pitched the whole load\ninto the mow on top of it. He went to work and pitched it all out, a\nhandful at a time, upon the barn floor, and when the hired man’s fork tine\ncame up with a $100 bill on it he knew they had struck a lead. He got it\nall.",
        "A man gave me two $5 bills once to pay a balance on some store teeth and\nasked me to bring the teeth back with me. The dentist was fifteen miles\naway and when I got there I found I had lost the money. That was before I\nhad amassed much of a fortune, so I went to the tooth foundry and told the\nforeman that I had started with $10 to get a set of teeth for an intimate\nfriend, but had lost the funds. He said that my intimate friend would, no\ndoubt, have to gum it awhile. Owing to the recent shrinkage in values he\nwas obliged to sell teeth for cash, as the goods were comparatively\nuseless after they had been used one season. I went back over the same\nroad the next day and found the money by the side of the road, although a\nhundred teams had passed by it.",
        "A young man, one spring, plowed a pocket-book and $30 in greenbacks under,\nand by a singular coincidence the next spring it was plowed out, and,\nthough rotten clear through, was sent to the Treasury, where it was\ndiscovered that the bills were on a Michigan National Bank, whither they\nwere sent and redeemed.",
        "I lost a roll of a hundred dollars the spring of ’82, and hunted my house\nand the office through, in search for it, in vain. I went over the road\nbetween the office and the house twenty times, but it was useless. I then\nadvertised the loss of the money, giving the different denominations of\nthe bills and stating, as was the case, that there was an elastic band\naround the roll when lost. The paper had not been issued more than an hour\nbefore I got my money, every dollar of it. It was in the pocket of my\nother vest.",
        "This should teach us, first, the value of advertising, and, secondly, the\nutter folly of two vests at the same time.",
        "Apropos of recent bank failures, I want to tell this one on James S.\nKelley, commonly called “Black Jim.” He failed himself along in the\nfifties, and by a big struggle had made out to pay everybody but Lo\nBartlett, to whom he was indebted in the sum of $18. He got this money,\nfinally, and as Lo wasn’t in town, Black Jim put it in a bank, the name of\nwhich has long ago sunk into oblivion. In fact, it began the oblivion\nbusiness about forty-eight hours after Jim had put his funds in there.",
        "Meeting Lo on the street, Jim said:",
        "“Your money is up in the Wild Oat Bank, Lo. I’ll give you a check for it.”",
        "“No use, old man, she’s gone up.”",
        "“No!!”",
        "“Yes, she’s a total wreck.”",
        "Jim went over to the president’s room. He knocked as easy as he could,\nconsidering that his breath was coming so hard.",
        "“Who’s there?”",
        "“It’s Jim Kelley, Black Jim, and I’m in something of a hurry.”",
        "“Well, I’m very busy, Mr. Kelley. Come again this afternoon.”",
        "“That will be too remote. I am very busy myself. Now is the accepted time.\nWill you open the door or shall I open it.”",
        "The president opened it because it was a good door and he wanted to\npreserve it.",
        "Black Jim turned the key in the door and sat down.",
        "“What did you want of me?” says the president",
        "“I wanted to see you about a certificate of deposit I’ve got here on your\nbank for eighteen dollars.”",
        "“We can’t pay it. Everything is gone.”",
        "“Well, I am here to get $18 or to leave you looking like a giblet pie.\nEighteen dollars will relieve you of this mental strain, but if you do not\nput up I will paper this wall with your classic features and ruin the\ncarpet with what remains.”",
        "The president hesitated a moment. Then he took a roll out of his boot and\npaid Jim eighteen dollars.",
        "“You will not mention this on the street, of course,” said the president.",
        "“No,” says Jim, “not till I get there.”",
        "When the crowd got back, however, the president had fled and he has\nremained fled ever since. The longer he remained away and thought it over,\nthe more he became attached to Canada, and the more of a confirmed and\nincurable fugitive he became.",
        "I saw Black Jim last evening and he said he had passed through two bank\nfailures, but had always realized on his certificates of deposit. One\ncashier told Jim that he was the homeliest man that ever looked through\nthe window of a busted bank. He said Kelley looked like a man who ate bank\ncashiers on toast and directors raw with a slice of lemon on top.",
