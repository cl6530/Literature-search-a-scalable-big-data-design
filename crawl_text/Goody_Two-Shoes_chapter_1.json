        "In The London Chronicle for December 19–January 1, 1765–the\nfollowing advertisement appeared:–",
        " “The Philosophers, Politicians, Necromancers, and the Learned in every\n  Faculty are desired to observe that on the 1st of January, being New\n  Year’s Day (Oh, that we may all lead new Lives!), Mr Newbery intends\n  to publish the following important volumes, bound and gilt, and hereby\n  invites all his little friends who are good to call for them at the\n  Bible and Sun, in St Paul’s Churchyard: but those who are naughty are\n  to have none.",
        " “1. The Renowned History of Giles Gingerbread: a little boy who lived\n     upon learning.",
        " “2. The Easter Gift; or the way to be good; a book much wanted.",
        " “3. The Whitsuntide Gift: or the way to be happy; a book very necessary\n     for all families.",
        " “4. The Valentine Gift: or how to behave with honour, integrity, and\n     humanity: very useful with a Trading Nation.",
        " “5. The Fairing: or a golden present for children. In which they can\n     see all the fun of the fair, and at home be as happy as if they were\n     there, a Book of great consequence to all whom it may concern.’",
        " “We are also desired to give notice that there is in the Press, and\n  speedily will be published either by subscription or otherwise, as the\n  Public shall please to determine, The History of Little Goody Two\n  Shoes, otherwise called Margery Two Shoes. Printed and sold at The\n  Bible and Sun in St Paul’s Churchyard, where may be had all Mr\n  Newbery’s little books for the children and youth of these kingdoms\n  and the colonies. New Editions of those which were out of print are\n  now republished.",
        " “The publication of the Lilliputian System of Politics is postponed\n  till the meeting of Parliament. This work, which will be replete with\n  cuts and characters, is not intended to exalt or depress any\n  particular country, to support the pride of any particular family, or\n  to feed the folly of any particular party, but to stimulate the mind\n  to virtue, to promote universal benevolence, to make mankind happy.\n  Those who would know more of the matter may enquire of Mr Newbery.”",
        "This quaint and curious announcement, with its sly humour and serious\nplayfulness, is characteristic of the house of John Newbery, in the\nlatter part of the last century; and there is no need to speak here of\nthe fame of the books for children which he published; “the\nphilanthropic publisher of St Paul’s Churchyard,” as Goldsmith calls\nhim, conferred inestimable benefits upon thousands of little folk, of\nboth high and low estate. It is said of Southey when a child that",
        " “The well-known publishers of “Goody Two Shoes,” “Giles Gingerbread,\"\n  and other such delectable histories, in sixpenny books for children,\n  splendidly bound in the flowered and gilt Dutch paper of former days,\n  sent him twenty such volumes, and laid the foundation of a love of\n  books which grew with the child’s growth, and did not cease even when\n  the vacant mind and eye could only gaze in piteous, though blissful\n  imbecility upon the things they loved.\"[A]",
        "Many of these little books have been doubtless long since forgotten,\nthough they did not deserve such a fate; but the name of “Goody Two\nShoes” is still familiar to the ears of English children, though the\nbook itself may be unknown to thousands of little ones of this later\ngeneration.",
        "“Goody Two Shoes” was published in April 1765, and few nursery books\nhave had a wider circulation, or have retained their position so long.\nThe number of editions that have been published both in England and\nAmerica is legion, and it has appeared in mutilated versions under the\nauspices of numerous publishing houses in London and the provinces,\nalthough of late years there have been no new issues. Even in 1802,\nCharles Lamb in writing to Coleridge, said–",
        " “\"Goody Two Shoes” is almost out of print. Mrs Barbauld’s stuff has\n  banished all the old classics of the nursery, and the shopman at\n  Newbery’s hardly deigned to reach them off an old exploded corner of\n  a shelf, when Mary asked for them. Mrs Barbauld’s and Mrs Trimmer’s\n  nonsense lay in piles about. Knowledge, insignificant and vapid as Mrs\n  Barbauld’s books convey, it seems must come to a child in the shape of\n  knowledge; and his empty noddle must be turned with conceit of his own\n  powers when he has learnt that a horse is an animal, and Billy is\n  better than a horse, and such like, instead of that beautiful interest\n  in wild tales, which made the child a man, while all the time he\n  suspected himself to be no bigger than a child. Science has succeeded\n  to poetry no less in the little walks of children than with men. Is\n  there no possibility of averting this sore evil? Think what you would\n  have been now, if instead of being fed with tales and old wives’\n  fables in childhood, you had been crammed with geography and natural\n  history!",
        " “Hang them!–I mean the cursed Barbauld crew, those blights and blasts\n  of all that is human in man and child.\"[B]",
        "There must, however, be many parents still living who remember the\ndelight that the little story gave them in their younger days, and\nthey will, no doubt, be pleased to see it once more in the form which\nwas then so familiar to them. The children of to-day, too, will look\non it with some curiosity, on account of the fact that it is one of\nthe oldest of our nursery tales, and amused and edified their\ngrand-parents and great grand-parents when they were children, while\nthey cannot fail to be attracted by its simple, pretty, and\ninteresting story.",
        "The question of the authorship of the book is still an unsettled one.\nIt was at one time commonly attributed to Oliver Goldsmith, and no one\nwho reads the book will consider it to be unworthy of the poet’s pen.\nWe find, however, in Nichol’s Literary Anecdotes, that",
        " “It is not perhaps generally known that to Mr Griffith Jones, and a\n  brother of his, Mr Giles Jones, in conjunction with Mr John Newbery,\n  the public are indebted for the origin of those numerous and popular\n  little books for the amusement and instruction of children which have\n  been ever since received with universal approbation. The Lilliputian\n  histories of Goody Two Shoes, Giles Gingerbread, Tommy Trip, &c., &c.,\n  are remarkable proofs of the benevolent minds of the projectors of\n  this plan of instruction, and respectable instances of the\n  accommodation of superior talents to the feeble intellects of\n  infantine felicity.”",
        "Mr Giles Jones was the grandfather of the late Mr Winter Jones,\nformerly the Principal Librarian of the British Museum, and the book\nis attributed to the first-named gentleman in the catalogue of the\nBritish Museum. It is claimed also that the book offers internal\nevidence in support of Mr Giles Jones’ authorship, inasmuch as Goody\nTwo Shoes becomes Lady Jones, and one of the prominent families in the\nbook is also named Jones.",
        "Beyond this, however, there appears to be no evidence as to Mr Giles\nJones being the writer, and I think something may be said as to the\nclaim on behalf of the poet Goldsmith, although I am by no means\nanxious that the honour of having written it should be ascribed either\nto the one or to the other: the following remarks, which are mainly\ntaken from an article I contributed to the Athenæum in April\n1881, are offered simply as speculations which may not be without\ninterest to lovers of the little book. They may, perhaps, show that\nthere is some reason for attributing the work to Oliver Goldsmith,\nalthough, of course, it is not claimed that they absolutely establish\nthe fact.",
        "Having occasion to examine carefully as many of the books for children\npublished by John Newbery as I could procure (and they are as scarce\nas blackberries in midwinter, for what among books has so brief a life\nas a nursery book?), I was struck while perusing them with a certain\ndistinct literary flavour, so to speak, which appeared to be common to\na group of little volumes, all published about the same period. These\nwere: “Goody Two Shoes,” “Giles Gingerbread,” “Tom Thumb’s Folio,\"\n“The Lilliputian Magazine,” “The Lilliputian Masquerade,” “The Easter\nGift,” “A Pretty Plaything,” “The Fairing,” “Be Merry and Wise,” “The\nValentine’s Gift,” “Pretty Poems for the Amusement of Children Three\nFeet High,” “A Pretty Book of Pictures,” “Tom Telescope,” and a few\nothers. I give abbreviated titles only, but if space permitted I mould\nlike to quote them in full; they are remarkable no less for their\ncurious quaintness and their clever ingenuity than for their\nattractiveness to both parents (who, it must not be forgotten, are\nmore often the real buyers of children’s books) and the young people\nfor whom they were written, and they are in themselves most\nentertaining and amusing reading. This group of little books\npossesses, moreover, another characteristic that is sufficiently\nremarkable of itself to be noticed. While they all evince a real\ngenius for writing in a style suited to the capacities of little folk,\nthere is a nameless something about them which, far more than is the\ncase with thousands of other books for the young, is calculated to\nenforce the attention and excite the interest of “children of a larger\ngrowth.”",
        "Now one of this little group, “The Lilliputian Magazine,” is\nattributed in the British Museum Catalogue to Oliver Goldsmith; and so\nstrong is the family likeness in all the books I have mentioned, that\nI cannot but believe they are all by the same hand–a belief which I\nthink will be shared by any one who will take the trouble to compare\nthem carefully. But I should advise him to rely on the Newbery\neditions alone, for grievously garbled versions of nearly every one of\nthese books have been issued from many different houses throughout the\ncountry.",
        "Many authorities have supported the view that Goldsmith was the author\nof “Goody Two Shoes.” Conspicuous among them was Washington Irving,\nwho says, “It is suggested with great probability that he wrote for Mr\nNewbery the famous nursery story of ’Goody Two Shoes.’” It is said\nalso that William Godwin held this opinion; and I believe there is\nauthority for stating that the Misses Bewick, the daughters of the\ncelebrated engraver, who illustrated an edition of the book for T.\nSaint, of Newcastle, understood from their father that it was by\nOliver Goldsmith.",
        "But let us turn to the book itself and see if it furnishes any\nevidence on the point. The very title, with its quaint phrasing, shows\nno common genius, and as Washington Irving says, “bears the stamp of\nhis [Goldsmith’s] sly and playful humour.” As the book was published\nin 1765, it would most likely have been written just at the time when\nGoldsmith was working most industriously in the service of Newbery\n(1763-4), at which period it will be remembered that he was living\nnear Newbery at Islington, and his publisher was paying for his board\nand lodging.",
        "Without, of course, claiming that similarity of idea in different\nwritings necessarily betokens the same authorship, I think the\nparallels that are to be found in this little book, with many of the\nsentiments in Oliver Goldsmith’s acknowledged work–to say nothing of\nthe almost universally recognized likeness to Goldsmith’s style that\nis found in “Goody Two Shoes” may fairly be considered as throwing\nsome light upon the question.",
        "The most striking of these parallels is perhaps that furnished by the\ncurious little political preface to the work–a preface which is quite\nunnecessary to the book, and I think would only have been inserted by\none who was full of the unjustnesses at which he was preparing to aim\na still heavier blow. In describing the parish of Mouldwell, where\nlittle Margery was born, an exact picture is drawn of “The Deserted\nVillage,” where",
        "  One only master grasps the whole domain\n  And half a tillage tints thy smiling plain;",
        "And where",
        "  –– the man of wealth and pride\n  Takes up a space that many a poor supplied:\n  Space for his lakes his park’s extended bounds,\n  Space for his horses, equipage, and hounds.",
        "And by this and other tyrannies, and being also",
        "  Scourged by famine from the smiling land,",
        "for he was “unfortunate in his business” at about the same time, Sir\nTimothy accomplishes his aim, and",
        "  Indignant spurns the cottage from the green.",
        "Ruined by this oppression, poor Mr Meanwell is turned out of doors,\nand flew to another parish for succour.",
        "  Where, then, ah! where shall poverty reside\n  To ’scape the pressure of contiguous pride?",
        "Sir Timothy, however, suffers for his injustice and wickedness, for\n“great part of the land lay untilled for some years, which was deemed\na just reward for such diabolical proceedings.”",
        "  Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,\n  Where wealth accumulates and men decay.",
        "Miss Charlotte Yonge, to whom I shall refer again, lays upon this: “If\nthe conjecture be true which attributes this tale to Oliver Goldsmith,\nwe have seen the same spirit which prompted his poem of ’The Deserted\nVillage,’ namely, indignation and dismay at the discouragement of\nsmall holdings in the early part of the eighteenth century.\"[C]\nIndeed, it may well be that we have in this preface even a more true\npicture of Lissoy than that given in the poem, which, as Mr William\nBlack says in his monograph on Goldsmith, “is there seen through the\nsoftening and beautifying mist of years.”",
        "Much more might be said of the characteristics of this little book,\nwhich contains so much that reminds us not only of the style but the\nmatter of many of Goldsmith’s writings. Miss Yonge says: “There is a\ncertain dry humour in some passages and a tenderness in others that\nincline us much to the belief that it could come from no one else but\nthe writer of ’The Vicar of Wakefield’ and ’The Deserted Village.’\nIndeed, we could almost imagine that Dr Primrose himself had described\nthe panic at the supposed ghost in the church in the same tone as the\nride to church, the family portrait, or the gross of green\nspectacles.’[D] We find in “Goody Two Shoes” every one of those\ndistinctive qualities of Goldsmith’s writings which Mr William Black\nso well summarizes in the book already referred to–\"his genuine and\ntender pathos, that never at any time verges on the affected or\ntheatrical;” his “quaint, delicate, delightful humour;” his “broader\nhumour, that is not afraid to provoke the wholesome laughter of\nmankind by dealing with common and familiar ways and manners and men;\"\nhis “choiceness of diction;” his “lightness and grace of touch, that\nlend a charm even to” his “ordinary hack work.”",
        "The reprint which is here presented is a photographic facsimile of\nthe earliest complete copy that we have been able to procure. Judging\nfrom fragments of earlier editions in the possession of the\npublishers, it would appear to be printed from exactly the same types\nas the original issue of April 1765. The copy from which the reprint\nis made was kindly lent to the publishers by Mr Ernest Hartley\nColeridge, whose collection at the South Kensington Museum of\neighteenth century books for children is well known. The actual size\nof that book is 4 inches by 2-3/4, but it has been thought better to\nprint on somewhat larger paper. The original is bound in the once\nfamiliar Dutch flowered and gilt pattern paper, and we had hoped to\npresent the reprint in a similar cover, but it was found impossible,\nas nothing like it could be procured, nor could the manufacturers of\nthe present day exactly reproduce it.",

By the Editor.\nAll the World must allow, that Two Shoes was not her real Name.\nNo; her Father’s Name was Meanwell; and he was for many Years a\nconsiderable Farmer in the Parish where Margery was born; but\nby the Misfortunes which he met with in Business, and the wicked\nPersecutions of Sir Timothy Gripe, and an over-grown Farmer\ncalled Graspall, he was effectually ruined.\nThe Case was thus. The Parish of Mouldwell where they lived,\nhad for many Ages been let by the Lord of the Manor into twelve\ndifferent Farms, in which the Tenants lived comfortably, brought up\nlarge Families, and carefully supported the poor People who laboured\nfor them; until the Estate by Marriage and by Death came into the\nHands of Sir Timothy.\nThis Gentleman, who loved himself better than all his Neighbours,\nthought it less Trouble to write one Receipt for his Rent than twelve,\nand Farmer Graspall offering to take all the Farms as the Leases\nexpired, Sir Timothy agreed with him, and in Process of Time he was\npossessed of every Farm, but that occupied by little Margery’sFather; which he also wanted; for as Mr. Meanwell was a charitable\ngood Man, he stood up for the Poor at the Parish Meetings, and was\nunwilling to have them oppressed by Sir Timothy, and this\navaricious Farmer.–Judge, oh kind, humane and courteous Reader, what\na terrible Situation the Poor must be in, when this covetous Man was\nperpetual Overseer, and every Thing for their Maintenance was drawn\nfrom his hard Heart and cruel Hand. But he was not only perpetual\nOverseer, but perpetual Church-warden; and judge, oh ye Christians,\nwhat State the Church must be in, when supported by a Man without\nReligion or Virtue. He was also perpetual Surveyor of the Highways,\nand what Sort of Roads he kept up for the Convenience of Travellers,\nthose best know who have had the Misfortune to be obliged to pass\nthro’ that Parish.–Complaints indeed were made, but to what Purpose\nare Complaints, when brought against a Man, who can hunt, drink, and\nsmoak with the Lord of the Manor, who is also the Justice of Peace?\nThe Opposition which little Margery’s Father made to this Man’s\nTyranny, gave Offence to Sir Timothy, who endeavoured to force\nhim out of his Farm; and to oblige him to throw up the Lease, ordered\nboth a Brick Kiln and a Dog-kennel to be erected in the Farmer’s\nOrchard. This was contrary to Law, and a Suit was commenced, in which\nMargery’s Father got the better. The same Offence was again\ncommitted three different Times, and as many Actions brought, in all\nof which the Farmer had a Verdict and Costs paid him; but\nnotwithstanding these Advantages, the Law was so expensive, that he\nwas ruined in the Contest, and obliged to give up all he had to his\nCreditors; which effectually answered the Purpose of Sir\nTimothy, who erected those Nuisances in the Farmer’s Orchard\nwith that Intention only. Ah, my dear Reader, we brag of Liberty, and\nboast of our Laws: but the Blessings of the one, and the Protection of\nthe other, seldom fall to the Lot of the Poor; and especially when a\nrich Man is their Adversary. How, in the Name of Goodness, can a poor\nWretch obtain Redress, when thirty Pounds are insufficient to try his\nCause? Where is he to find Money to see Council, or how can he plead\nhis Cause himself (even if he was permitted) when our Laws are so\nobscure, and so multiplied, that an Abridgment of them cannot be\ncontained in fifty Volumes in Folio?\nAs soon as Mr. Meanwell had called together his Creditors, Sir\nTimothy seized for a Year’s Rent, and turned the Farmer, his\nWife, little Margery, and her Brother out of Doors, without any\nof the Necessaries of Life to support them.\nThis elated the Heart of Mr. Graspall, this crowned his Hopes,\nand filled the Measure of his Iniquity; for besides gratifying his\nRevenge, this Man’s Overthrow gave him the sole Dominion of the Poor,\nwhom he depressed and abused in a Manner too horrible to mention.\nMargery’s Father flew into another Parish for Succour, and all\nthose who were able to move left their Dwellings and sought Employment\nelsewhere, as they found it would be impossible to live under the\nTyranny of two such People. The very old, the very lame and the blind\nwere obliged to stay behind, and whether they were starved, or what\nbecame of them, History does not say; but the Character of the great\nSir Timothy, and his avaricious Tenant, were so infamous, that\nnobody would work for them by the Day, and Servants were afraid to\nengage themselves by the Year, lest any unforeseen Accident should\nleave them Parishioners in a Place, where they knew they must perish\nmiserably; so that great Part of the Land lay untilled for some Years,\nwhich was deemed a just Reward for such diabolical Proceedings.\nBut what, says the Reader, can occasion all this? Do you intend this\nfor Children, Mr. NEWBERY? Why, do you suppose this is written by Mr.\nNEWBERY, Sir? This may come from another Hand. This is not the Book,\nSir, mentioned in the Title, but the Introduction to that Book; and it\nis intended, Sir, not for those Sort of Children, but for Children of\nsix Feet high, of which, as my Friend has justly observed, there are\nmany Millions in the Kingdom; and these Reflections, Sir, have been\nrendered necessary, by the unaccountable and diabolical Scheme which\nmany Gentlemen now give into, of laying a Number of Farms into one,\nand very often of a whole Parish into one Farm; which in the End must\nreduce the common People to a State of Vassalage, worse than that\nunder the Barons of old, or of the Clans in Scotland; and will\nin Time depopulate the Kingdom. But as you are tired of the Subject, I\nshall take myself away, and you may visit Little Margery. So,\nSir, your Servant,\nThe Editor.\nContinue... Part I. Introduction  •  Chap. I.  •  Chap.

This was contrary to Law, and a Suit was commenced, in which\nMargery’s Father got the better. The same Offence was again\ncommitted three different Times, and as many Actions brought, in all\nof which the Farmer had a Verdict and Costs paid him; but\nnotwithstanding these Advantages, the Law was so expensive, that he\nwas ruined in the Contest, and obliged to give up all he had to his\nCreditors; which effectually answered the Purpose of Sir\nTimothy, who erected those Nuisances in the Farmer’s Orchard\nwith that Intention only. Ah, my dear Reader, we brag of Liberty, and\nboast of our Laws: but the Blessings of the one, and the Protection of\nthe other, seldom fall to the Lot of the Poor; and especially when a\nrich Man is their Adversary. How, in the Name of Goodness, can a poor\nWretch obtain Redress, when thirty Pounds are insufficient to try his\nCause? Where is he to find Money to see Council, or how can he plead\nhis Cause himself (even if he was permitted) when our Laws are so\nobscure, and so multiplied, that an Abridgment of them cannot be\ncontained in fifty Volumes in Folio?",
        "As soon as Mr. Meanwell had called together his Creditors, Sir\nTimothy seized for a Year’s Rent, and turned the Farmer, his\nWife, little Margery, and her Brother out of Doors, without any\nof the Necessaries of Life to support them.",
        "This elated the Heart of Mr. Graspall, this crowned his Hopes,\nand filled the Measure of his Iniquity; for besides gratifying his\nRevenge, this Man’s Overthrow gave him the sole Dominion of the Poor,\nwhom he depressed and abused in a Manner too horrible to mention.",
        "Margery’s Father flew into another Parish for Succour, and all\nthose who were able to move left their Dwellings and sought Employment\nelsewhere, as they found it would be impossible to live under the\nTyranny of two such People. The very old, the very lame and the blind\nwere obliged to stay behind, and whether they were starved, or what\nbecame of them, History does not say; but the Character of the great\nSir Timothy, and his avaricious Tenant, were so infamous, that\nnobody would work for them by the Day, and Servants were afraid to\nengage themselves by the Year, lest any unforeseen Accident should\nleave them Parishioners in a Place, where they knew they must perish\nmiserably; so that great Part of the Land lay untilled for some Years,\nwhich was deemed a just Reward for such diabolical Proceedings.",
        "But what, says the Reader, can occasion all this? Do you intend this\nfor Children, Mr. NEWBERY? Why, do you suppose this is written by Mr.\nNEWBERY, Sir? This may come from another Hand. This is not the Book,\nSir, mentioned in the Title, but the Introduction to that Book; and it\nis intended, Sir, not for those Sort of Children, but for Children of\nsix Feet high, of which, as my Friend has justly observed, there are\nmany Millions in the Kingdom; and these Reflections, Sir, have been\nrendered necessary, by the unaccountable and diabolical Scheme which\nmany Gentlemen now give into, of laying a Number of Farms into one,\nand very often of a whole Parish into one Farm; which in the End must\nreduce the common People to a State of Vassalage, worse than that\nunder the Barons of old, or of the Clans in Scotland; and will\nin Time depopulate the Kingdom. But as you are tired of the Subject, I\nshall take myself away, and you may visit Little Margery. So,\nSir, your Servant,",
