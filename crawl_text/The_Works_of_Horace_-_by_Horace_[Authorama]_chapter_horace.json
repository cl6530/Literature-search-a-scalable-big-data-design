        "TO MAECENAS.",
        "Maecenas, descended from royal ancestors, O both my protection and my\ndarling honor! There are those whom it delights to have collected\nOlympic dust in the chariot race; and [whom] the goal nicely avoided by\nthe glowing wheels, and the noble palm, exalts, lords of the earth, to\nthe gods.",
        "This man, if a crowd of the capricious Quirites strive to raise him to\nthe highest dignities; another, if he has stored up in his own granary\nwhatsoever is swept from the Libyan thrashing floors: him who delights\nto cut with the hoe his patrimonial fields, you could never tempt, for\nall the wealth of Attalus, [to become] a timorous sailor and cross the\nMyrtoan sea in a Cyprian bark. The merchant, dreading the south-west\nwind contending with the Icarian waves, commends tranquility and the\nrural retirement of his village; but soon after, incapable of being\ntaught to bear poverty, he refits his shattered vessel. There is\nanother, who despises not cups of old Massic, taking a part from the\nentire day, one while stretched under the green arbute, another at the\nplacid head of some sacred stream.",
        "The camp, and the sound of the trumpet mingled with that of the clarion,\nand wars detested by mothers, rejoice many.",
        "The huntsman, unmindful of his tender spouse, remains in the cold air,\nwhether a hart is held in view by his faithful hounds, or a Marsian boar\nhas broken the fine-wrought toils.",
        "Ivy, the reward of learned brows, equals me with the gods above: the\ncool grove, and the light dances of nymphs and satyrs, distinguish me\nfrom the crowd; if neither Euterpe withholds her pipe, nor Polyhymnia\ndisdains to tune the Lesbian lyre. But, if you rank me among the lyric\npoets, I shall tower to the stars with my exalted head.",
        "ODE II.",
        "TO AUGUSTUS CAESAR",
        "Enough of snow and dreadful hail has the Sire now sent upon the earth,\nand having hurled [his thunderbolts] with his red right hand against the\nsacred towers, he has terrified the city; he has terrified the nations,\nlest the grievous age of Pyrrha, complaining of prodigies till then\nunheard of, should return, when Proteus drove all his [marine] herd to\nvisit the lofty mountains; and the fishy race were entangled in the elm\ntop, which before was the frequented seat of doves; and the timorous\ndeer swam in the overwhelming flood. We have seen the yellow Tiber, with\nhis waves forced back with violence from the Tuscan shore, proceed to\ndemolish the monuments of king [Numa], and the temples of Vesta; while\nhe vaunts himself the avenger of the too disconsolate Ilia, and the\nuxorious river, leaving his channel, overflows his left bank,\nnotwithstanding the disapprobation of Jupiter.",
        "Our youth, less numerous by the vices of their fathers, shall hear of\nthe citizens having whetted that sword [against themselves], with which\nit had been better that the formidable Persians had fallen; they shall\nhear of [actual] engagements. Whom of the gods shall the people invoke\nto the affairs of the sinking empire? With what prayer shall the sacred\nvirgins importune Vesta, who is now inattentive to their hymns? To whom\nshall Jupiter assign the task of expiating our wickedness? Do thou at\nlength, prophetic Apollo, (we pray thee!) come, vailing thy radiant\nshoulders with a cloud: or thou, if it be more agreeable to thee,\nsmiling Venus, about whom hover the gods of mirth and love: or thou, if\nthou regard thy neglected race and descendants, our founder Mars, whom\nclamor and polished helmets, and the terrible aspect of the Moorish\ninfantry against their bloody enemy, delight, satiated at length with\nthy sport, alas! of too long continuance: or if thou, the winged son of\ngentle Maia, by changing thy figure, personate a youth upon earth,\nsubmitting to be called the avenger of Caesar; late mayest thou return\nto the skies, and long mayest thou joyously be present to the Roman\npeople; nor may an untimely blast transport thee from us, offended at\nour crimes. Here mayest thou rather delight in magnificent triumphs, and\nto be called father and prince: nor suffer the Parthians with impunity\nto make incursions, you, O Caesar, being our general.",
        "ODE III.",
        "TO THE SHIP, IN WHICH VIRGIL WAS ABOUT TO SAIL TO ATHENS.",
        "So may the goddess who rules over Cyprus; so may the bright stars, the\nbrothers of Helen; and so may the father of the winds, confining all\nexcept Iapyx, direct thee, O ship, who art intrusted with Virgil; my\nprayer is, that thou mayest land him safe on the Athenian shore, and\npreserve the half of my soul. Surely oak and three-fold brass surrounded\nhis heart who first trusted a frail vessel to the merciless ocean, nor\nwas afraid of the impetuous Africus contending with the northern storms,\nnor of the mournful Hyades, nor of the rage of Notus, than whom there is\nnot a more absolute controller of the Adriatic, either to raise or\nassuage its waves at pleasure. What path of death did he fear, who\nbeheld unmoved the rolling monsters of the deep; who beheld unmoved the\ntempestuous swelling of the sea, and the Acroceraunians–ill-famed\nrocks?",
        "In vain has God in his wisdom divided the countries of the earth by the\nseparating ocean, if nevertheless profane ships bound over waters not to\nbe violated. The race of man presumptuous enough to endure everything,\nrushes on through forbidden wickedness.",
        "The presumptuous son of Iapetus, by an impious fraud, brought down fire\ninto the world. After fire was stolen from the celestial mansions,\nconsumption and a new train of fevers settled upon the earth, and the\nslow approaching necessity of death, which, till now, was remote,\naccelerated its pace. Daedalus essayed the empty air with wings not\npermitted to man. The labor of Hercules broke through Acheron. There is\nnothing too arduous for mortals to attempt. We aim at heaven itself in\nour folly; neither do we suffer, by our wickedness, Jupiter to lay aside\nhis revengeful thunderbolts.",
        "ODE IV.",
        "TO SEXTIUS.",
        "Severe winter is melted away beneath the agreeable change of spring and\nthe western breeze; and engines haul down the dry ships. And neither\ndoes the cattle any longer delight in the stalls, nor the ploughman in\nthe fireside; nor are the meadows whitened by hoary frosts. Now\nCytherean Venus leads off the dance by moonlight; and the comely Graces,\nin conjunction with the Nymphs, shake the ground with alternate feet;\nwhile glowing Vulcan kindles the laborious forges of the Cyclops. Now it\nis fitting to encircle the shining head either with verdant myrtle, or\nwith such flowers as the relaxed earth produces. Now likewise it is\nfitting to sacrifice to Faunus in the shady groves, whether he demand a\nlamb, or be more pleased with a kid. Pale death knocks at the cottages\nof the poor, and the palaces of kings, with an impartial foot. O happy\nSextius! The short sum total of life forbids us to form remote\nexpectations. Presently shall darkness, and the unreal ghosts, and the\nshadowy mansion of Pluto oppress you; where, when you shall have once\narrived, you shall neither decide the dominion of the bottle by dice,\nnor shall you admire the tender Lycidas, with whom now all the youth is\ninflamed, and for whom ere long the maidens will grow warm.",
        "ODE V.",
        "TO PYRRHA.",
        "What dainty youth, bedewed with liquid perfumes, caresses you, Pyrrha,\nbeneath the pleasant grot, amid a profusion of roses? For whom do you\nbind your golden hair, plain in your neatness? Alas! how often shall he\ndeplore your perfidy, and the altered gods; and through inexperience be\namazed at the seas, rough with blackening storms who now credulous\nenjoys you all precious, and, ignorant of the faithless gale, hopes you\nwill be always disengaged, always amiable! Wretched are those, to whom\nthou untried seemest fair? The sacred wall [of Neptune’s temple]\ndemonstrates, by a votive tablet, that I have consecrated my dropping\ngarments to the powerful god of the sea.",
        "ODE VI.",
        "TO AGRIPPA.",
        "You shall be described by Varius, a bird of Maeonian verse, as brave,\nand a subduer of your enemies, whatever achievements your fierce\nsoldiery shall have accomplished, under your command; either on\nship-board or on horseback. We humble writers, O Agrippa, neither\nundertake these high subjects, nor the destructive wrath of inexorable\nAchilles, nor the voyages of the crafty Ulysses, nor the cruel house of\nPelops: while diffidence, and the Muse who presides over the peaceful\nlyre, forbid me to diminish the praise of illustrious Caesar, and yours,\nthrough defect of genius. Who with sufficient dignity will describe Mars\ncovered with adamantine coat of mail, or Meriones swarthy with Trojan\ndust, or the son of Tydeus by the favor of Pallas a match for the gods?\nWe, whether free, or ourselves enamored of aught, light as our wont,\nsing of banquets; we, of the battles of maids desperate against young\nfellows–with pared nails.",
        "ODE VII.",
        "TO MUNATIUS PLANCUS.",
        "Other poets shall celebrate the famous Rhodes, or Mitylene, or Ephesus,\nor the walls of Corinth, situated between two seas, or Thebes,\nillustrious by Bacchus, or Delphi by Apollo, or the Thessalian Tempe.\nThere are some, whose one task it is to chant in endless verse the city\nof spotless Pallas, and to prefer the olive culled from every side, to\nevery other leaf. Many a one, in honor of Juno, celebrates Argos,\nproductive of steeds, and rich Mycenae. Neither patient Lacedaemon so\nmuch struck me, nor so much did the plain of fertile Larissa, as the\nhouse of resounding Albunea, and the precipitately rapid Anio, and the\nTiburnian groves, and the orchards watered by ductile rivulets. As the\nclear south wind often clears away the clouds from a lowering sky, now\nteems with perpetual showers; so do you, O Plancus, wisely remember to\nput an end to grief and the toils of life by mellow wine; whether the\ncamp, refulgent with banners, possess you, or the dense shade of your\nown Tibur shall detain you. When Teucer fled from Salamis and his\nfather, he is reported, notwithstanding, to have bound his temples,\nbathed in wine, with a poplar crown, thus accosting his anxious friends:\n\"O associates and companions, we will go wherever fortune, more\npropitious than a father, shall carry us. Nothing is to be despaired of\nunder Teucer’s conduct, and the auspices of Teucer: for the infallible\nApollo has promised, that a Salamis in a new land shall render the name\nequivocal. O gallant heroes, and often my fellow-sufferers in greater\nhardships than these, now drive away your cares with wine: to-morrow we\nwill re-visit the vast ocean.”",
        "ODE VIII.",
        "TO LYDIA.",
        "Lydia, I conjure thee by all the powers above, to tell me why you are so\nintent to ruin Sybaris by inspiring him with love? Why hates he the\nsunny plain, though inured to bear the dust and heat? Why does he\nneither, in military accouterments, appear mounted among his equals; nor\nmanage the Gallic steed with bitted reins? Why fears he to touch the\nyellow Tiber? Why shuns he the oil of the ring more cautiously than\nviper’s blood? Why neither does he, who has often acquired reputation by\nthe quoit, often by the javelin having cleared the mark, any longer\nappear with arms all black-and-blue by martial exercises? Why is he\nconcealed, as they say the son of the sea-goddess Thetis was, just\nbefore the mournful funerals of Troy; lest a manly habit should hurry\nhim to slaughter, and the Lycian troops?",
        "ODE IX.",
        "TO THALIARCHUS.",
        "You see how Soracte stands white with deep snow, nor can the laboring\nwoods any longer support the weight, and the rivers stagnate with the\nsharpness of the frost. Dissolve the cold, liberally piling up billets\non the hearth; and bring out, O Thaliarchus, the more generous wine,\nfour years old, from the Sabine jar. Leave the rest to the gods, who\nhaving once laid the winds warring with the fervid ocean, neither the\ncypresses nor the aged ashes are moved. Avoid inquiring what may happen\ntomorrow; and whatever day fortune shall bestow on you, score it up for\ngain; nor disdain, being a young fellow, pleasant loves, nor dances, as\nlong as ill-natured hoariness keeps off from your blooming age. Now let\nboth the Campus Martius and the public walks, and soft whispers at the\napproach of evening be repeated at the appointed hour: now, too, the\ndelightful laugh, the betrayer of the lurking damsel from some secret\ncorner, and the token ravished from her arms or fingers, pretendingly\ntenacious of it.",
        "ODE X.",
        "TO MERCURY.",
        "Mercury, eloquent grandson of Atlas, thou who artful didst from the\nsavage manners of the early race of men by oratory, and the institution\nof the graceful Palaestra: I will celebrate thee, messenger of Jupiter\nand the other gods, and parent of the curved lyre; ingenious to conceal\nwhatever thou hast a mind to, in jocose theft. While Apollo, with angry\nvoice, threatened you, then but a boy, unless you would restore the\noxen, previously driven away by your fraud, he laughed, [when he found\nhimself] deprived of his quiver [also]. Moreover, the wealthy Priam too,\non his departure from Ilium, under your guidance deceived the proud sons\nof Atreus, and the Thessalian watch-lights, and the camp inveterate\nagaist Troy. You settle the souls of good men in blissful regions, and\ndrive together the airy crowd with your golden rod, acceptable both to\nthe supernal and infernal gods.",
        "ODE XI.",
        "TO LEUCONOE.",
        "Inquire not, Leuconoe (it is not fitting you should know), how long a\nterm of life the gods have granted to you or to me: neither consult the\nChaldean calculations. How much better is it to bear with patience\nwhatever shall happen! Whether Jupiter have granted us more winters, or\n[this as] the last, which now breaks the Etrurian waves against the\nopposing rocks. Be wise; rack off your wines, and abridge your hopes [in\nproportion] to the shortness of your life. While we are conversing,\nenvious age has been flying; seize the present day, not giving the least\ncredit to the succeeding one.",
        "ODE XII.",
        "TO AUGUSTUS.",
        "What man, what hero, O Clio, do you undertake to celebrate on the harp,\nor the shrill pipe? What god? Whose name shall the sportive echo\nresound, either in the shady borders of Helicon, or on the top of\nPindus, or on cold Haemus? Whence the woods followed promiscuously the\ntuneful Orpheus, who by his maternal art retarded the rapid courses of\nrivers, and the fleet winds; and was so sweetly persuasive, that he drew\nalong the listening oaks with his harmonious strings. But what can I\nsing prior to the usual praises of the Sire, who governs the affairs of\nmen and gods; who [governs] the sea, the earth, and the whole world with\nthe vicissitudes of seasons? Whence nothing is produced greater than\nhim; nothing springs either like him, or even in a second degree to him:\nnevertheless, Pallas has acquired these honors, which are next after\nhim.",
        "Neither will I pass thee by in silence, O Bacchus, bold in combat; nor\nthee, O Virgin, who art an enemy to the savage beasts; nor thee, O\nPhoebus, formidable for thy unerring dart.",
        "I will sing also of Hercules, and the sons of Leda, the one illustrious\nfor his achievements on horseback, the other on foot; whose\nclear-shining constellation as soon as it has shone forth to the\nsailors, the troubled surge falls down from the rocks, the winds cease,\nthe clouds vanish, and the threatening waves subside in the sea–because\nit was their will. After these, I am in doubt whom I shall first\ncommemorate, whether Romulus, or the peaceful reign of Numa, or the\nsplendid ensigns of Tarquinius, or the glorious death of Cato. I will\ncelebrate, out of gratitude, with the choicest verses, Regulus, and the\nScauri, and Paulus, prodigal of his mighty soul, when Carthage\nconquered, and Fabricius.",
        "Severe poverty, and an hereditary farm, with a dwelling suited to it,\nformed this hero useful in war; as it did also Curius with his rough\nlocks, and Camillus. The fame of Marcellus increases, as a tree does in\nthe insensible progress of time. But the Julian constellation shines\namid them all, as the moon among the smaller stars. O thou son of\nSaturn, author and preserver of the human race, the protection of Caesar\nis committed to thy charge by the Fates: thou shalt reign supreme, with\nCaesar for thy second. Whether he shall subdue with a just victory the\nParthians making inroads upon Italy, or shall render subject the Seres\nand Indians on the Eastern coasts; he shall rule the wide world with\nequity, in subordination to thee. Thou shalt shake Olympus with thy\ntremendous car; thou shalt hurl thy hostile thunderbolts against the\npolluted groves.",
        "ODE XIII.",
        "TO LYDIA.",
        "O Lydia, when you commend Telephus’ rosy neck, and the waxen arms of\nTelephus, alas! my inflamed liver swells with bile difficult to be\nrepressed. Then neither is my mind firm, nor does my color maintain a\ncertain situation: and the involuntary tears glide down my cheek,\nproving with what lingering flames I am inwardly consumed. I am on fire,\nwhether quarrels rendered immoderate by wine have stained your fair\nshoulders; or whether the youth, in his fury, has impressed with his\nteeth a memorial on your lips. If you will give due attention to my\nadvice, never expect that he will be constant, who inhumanly wounds\nthose sweet kisses, which Venus has imbued with the fifth part of all\nher nectar. O thrice and more than thrice happy those, whom an\nindissoluble connection binds together; and whose love, undivided by\nimpious complainings, does not separate them sooner than the last day!",
        "ODE XIV.",
        "TO THE ROMAN STATE.",
        "O ship, new waves will bear you back again to sea. O what are you doing?\nBravely seize the port. Do you not perceive, that your sides are\ndestitute of oars, and your mast wounded by the violent south wind, and\nyour main-yards groan, and your keel can scarcely support the\nimpetuosity of the waves without the help of cordage? You have not\nentire sails; nor gods, whom you may again invoke, pressed with\ndistress: notwithstanding you are made of the pines of Pontus, and as\nthe daughter of an illustrious wood, boast your race, and a fame now of\nno service to you. The timorous sailor has no dependence on a painted\nstern. Look to yourself, unless you are destined to be the sport of the\nwinds. O thou, so lately my trouble and fatigue, but now an object of\ntenderness and solicitude, mayest thou escape those dangerous seas which\nflow among the shining Cyclades.",
        "ODE XV.",
        "TO PARIS.",
        "When the perfidious shepherd (Paris) carried off by sea in Trojan ships\nhis hostess Helen, Nereus suppressed the swift winds in an unpleasant\ncalm, that he might sing the dire fates. “With unlucky omen art thou\nconveying home her, whom Greece with a numerous army shall demand back\nagain, having entered into a confederacy to dissolve your nuptials, and\nthe ancient kingdom of Priam. Alas! what sweat to horses, what to men,\nis just at hand! What a destruction art thou preparing for the Trojan\nnation! Even now Pallas is fitting her helmet, and her shield, and her\nchariot, and her fury. In vain, looking fierce through the patronage of\nVenus, will you comb your hair, and run divisions upon the effeminate\nlyre with songs pleasing to women. In vain will you escape the spears\nthat disturb the nuptial bed, and the point of the Cretan dart, and the\ndin [of battle], and Ajax swift in the pursuit. Nevertheless, alas! the\ntime will come, though late, when thou shalt defile thine adulterous\nhairs in the dust. Dost thou not see the son of Laertes, fatal to thy\nnation, and Pylian Nestor, Salaminian Teucer, and Sthenelus skilled in\nfight (or if there be occasion to manage horses, no tardy charioteer),\npursue thee with intrepidity? Meriones also shalt thou experience.\nBehold! the gallant son of Tydeus, a better man than his father, glows\nto find you out: him, as a stag flies a wolf, which he has seen on the\nopposite side of the vale, unmindful of his pasture, shall you,\neffeminate, fly, grievously panting:–not such the promises you made\nyour mistress. The fleet of the enraged Achilles shall defer for a time\nthat day, which is to be fatal to Troy and the Trojan matrons: but,\nafter a certain number of years, Grecian fire shall consume the Trojan\npalaces.”",
        "ODE XVI.",
        "TO A YOUNG LADY HORACE HAD OFFENDED.",
        "O daughter, more charming than your charming mother, put what end you\nplease to my insulting iambics; either in the flames, or, if you choose\nit, in the Adriatic. Nor Cybele, nor Apollo, the dweller in the shrines,\nso shakes the breast of his priests; Bacchus does not do it equally, nor\ndo the Corybantes so redouble their strokes on the sharp-sounding\ncymbals, as direful anger; which neither the Noric sword can deter, nor\nthe shipwrecking sea, nor dreadful fire, not Jupiter himself rushing\ndown with awful crash. It is reported that Prometheus was obliged to add\nto that original clay [with which he formed mankind], some ingredient\ntaken from every animal, and that he applied the vehemence of the raging\nlion to the human breast. It was rage that destroyed Thyestes with\nhorrible perdition; and has been the final cause that lofty cities have\nbeen entirely demolished, and that an insolent army has driven the\nhostile plowshare over their walls. Compose your mind. An ardor of soul\nattacked me also in blooming youth, and drove me in a rage to the\nwriting of swift-footed iambics. Now I am desirous of exchanging\nseverity for good nature, provided that you will become my friend, after\nmy having recanted my abuse, and restore me your affections.",
        "ODE XVII.",
        "TO TYNDARIS.",
        "The nimble Faunus often exchanges the Lycaean mountain for the pleasant\nLucretilis, and always defends my she-goats from the scorching summer,\nand the rainy winds. The wandering wives of the unsavory husband seek\nthe hidden strawberry-trees and thyme with security through the safe\ngrove: nor do the kids dread the green lizards, or the wolves sacred to\nMars; whenever, my Tyndaris, the vales and the smooth rocks of the\nsloping Ustica have resounded with his melodious pipe. The gods are my\nprotectors. My piety and my muse are agreeable to the gods. Here plenty,\nrich with rural honors, shall flow to you, with her generous horn filled\nto the brim. Here, in a sequestered vale, you shall avoid the heat of\nthe dog-star; and, on your Anacreontic harp, sing of Penelope and the\nfrail Circe striving for one lover; here you shall quaff, under the\nshade, cups of unintoxicating Lesbian. Nor shall the raging son of\nSemele enter the combat with Mars; and unsuspected you shall not fear\nthe insolent Cyrus, lest he should savagely lay his intemperate hands on\nyou, who are by no means a match for him; and should rend the chaplet\nthat is platted in your hair, and your inoffensive garment.",
        "ODE XVIII.",
        "TO VARUS.",
        "O Varus, you can plant no tree preferable to the sacred vine, about the\nmellow soil of Tibur, and the walls of Catilus. For God hath rendered\nevery thing cross to the sober; nor do biting cares disperse any\notherwise [than by the use of wine]. Who, after wine, complains of the\nhardships of war or of poverty? Who does not rather [celebrate] thee,\nFather Bacchus, and thee, comely Venus? Nevertheless, the battle of the\nCentaurs with the Lapithae, which was fought in their cups, admonishes\nus not to exceed a moderate use of the gifts of Bacchus. And Bacchus\nhimself admonishes us in his severity to the Thracians; when greedy to\nsatisfy their lusts, they make little distinction between right and\nwrong. O beauteous Bacchus, I will not rouse thee against thy will, nor\nwill I hurry abroad thy [mysteries, which are] covered with various\nleaves. Cease your dire cymbals, together with your Phrygian horn, whose\nfollowers are blind Self-love and Arrogance, holding up too high her\nempty head, and the Faith communicative of secrets, and more transparent\nthan glass.",
        "ODE XIX.",
        "TO GLYCERA.",
        "The cruel mother of the Cupids, and the son of the Theban Gemele, and\nlascivious ease, command me to give back my mind to its deserted loves.\nThe splendor of Glycera, shining brighter than the Parian marble,\ninflames me: her agreeable petulance, and her countenance, too unsteady\nto be beheld, inflame me. Venus, rushing on me with her whole force, has\nquitted Cyprus; and suffers me not to sing of the Scythians, and the\nParthian, furious when his horse is turned for flight, or any subject\nwhich is not to the present purpose. Here, slaves, place me a live turf;\nhere, place me vervains and frankincense, with a flagon of two-year-old\nwine. She will approach more propitious, after a victim has been\nsacrificed.",
        "ODE XX.",
        "TO MAECENAS.",
        "My dear knight Maecenas, you shall drink [at my house] ignoble Sabine\nwine in sober cups, which I myself sealed up in the Grecian cask, stored\nat the time, when so loud an applause was given to you in the\namphitheatre, that the banks of your ancestral river, together with the\ncheerful echo of the Vatican mountain, returned your praises. You [when\nyou are at home] will drink the Caecuban, and the grape which is\nsqueezed in the Calenian press; but neither the Falernian vines, nor the\nFormian hills, season my cups.",
        "ODE XXI.",
        "ON DIANA AND APOLLO.",
        "Ye tender virgins, sing Diana; ye boys, sing Apollo with his unshorn\nhair, and Latona passionately beloved by the supreme Jupiter. Ye\n(virgins), praise her that rejoices in the rivers, and the thick groves,\nwhich project either from the cold Algidus, or the gloomy woods of\nErymanthus, or the green Cragus. Ye boys, extol with equal praises\nApollo’s Delos, and his shoulder adorned with a quiver, and with his\nbrother Mercury’s lyre. He, moved by your intercession, shall drive away\ncalamitous war, and miserable famine, and the plague from the Roman\npeople and their sovereign Caesar, to the Persians and the Britons.",
        "ODE XXII.",
        "TO ARISTIUS FUSCUS.",
        "The man of upright life and pure from wickedness, O Fuscus, has no need\nof the Moorish javelins, or bow, or quiver loaded with poisoned darts.\nWhether he is about to make his journey through the sultry Syrtes, or\nthe inhospitable Caucasus, or those places which Hydaspes, celebrated in\nstory, washes. For lately, as I was singing my Lalage, and wandered\nbeyond my usual bounds, devoid of care, a wolf in the Sabine wood fled\nfrom me, though I was unarmed: such a monster as neither the warlike\nApulia nourishes in its extensive woods, nor the land of Juba, the\ndry-nurse of lions, produces. Place me in those barren plains, where no\ntree is refreshed by the genial air; at that part of the world, which\nclouds and an inclement atmosphere infest. Place me under the chariot of\nthe too neighboring sun, in a land deprived of habitations; [there] will\nI love my sweetly-smiling, sweetly-speaking Lalage.",
        "ODE XXIII.",
        "TO CHLOE.",
        "You shun me, Chloe, like a fawn that is seeking its timorous mother in\nthe pathless mountains, not without a vain dread of the breezes and the\nthickets: for she trembles both in her heart and knees, whether the\narrival of the spring has terrified by its rustling leaves, or the green\nlizards have stirred the bush. But I do not follow you, like a savage\ntigress, or a Gaetulian lion, to tear you to pieces. Therefore, quit\nyour mother, now that you are mature for a husband.",
        "ODE XXIV.",
        "TO VIRGIL.",
        "What shame or bound can there be to our affectionate regret for so dear\na person? O Melpomene, on whom your father has bestowed a clear voice\nand the harp, teach me the mournful strains. Does then perpetual sleep\noppress Quinctilius? To whom when will modesty, and uncorrupt faith the\nsister of Justice, and undisguised truth, find any equal? He died\nlamented by many good men, but more lamented by none than by you, my\nVirgil. You, though pious, alas! in vain demand Quinctilius back from\nthe gods, who did not lend him to us on such terms. What, though you\ncould strike the lyre, listened to by the trees, with more sweetness\nthan the Thracian Orpheus; yet the blood can never return to the empty\nshade, which Mercury, inexorable to reverse the fates, has with his\ndreadful Caduceus once driven to the gloomy throng. This is hard: but\nwhat it is out of our power to amend, becomes more supportable by\npatience.",
        "ODE XXV.",

But the game\nnight awaits all, and the road of death must once be travelled. The\nFuries give up some to the sport of horrible Mars: the greedy ocean is\ndestructive to sailors: the mingled funerals of young and old are\ncrowded together: not a single person does the cruel Proserpine pass by.\nThe south wind, the tempestuous attendant on the setting Orion, has sunk\nme also in the Illyrian waves. But do not thou, O sailor, malignantly\ngrudge to give a portion of loose sand to my bones and unburied head.\nSo, whatever the east wind shall threaten to the Italian sea, let the\nVenusinian woods suffer, while you are in safety; and manifold profit,\nfrom whatever port it may, come to you by favoring Jove, and Neptune,\nthe defender of consecrated Tarentum.

A rivulet of clear water, and a wood of a few\nacres, and a certain prospect of my good crop, are blessings unknown to\nhim who glitters in the proconsulship of fertile Africa: I am more\nhappily circumstanced.

But those\ntroops, which had been for a long while and extensively victorious,\nbeing subdued by the conduct of a youth, perceived what a disposition,\nwhat a genius rightly educated under an auspicious roof, what the\nfatherly affection of Augustus toward the young Neros, could effect. The\nbrave are generated by the brave and good; there is in steers, there is\nin horses, the virtue of their sires; nor do the courageous eagles\nprocreate the unwarlike dove. But learning improves the innate force,\nand good discipline confirms the mind: whenever morals are deficient,\nvices disgrace what is naturally good. What thou owest, O Rome, to the\nNeros, the river Metaurus is a witness, and the defeated Asdrubal, and\nthat day illustrious by the dispelling of darkness from Italy, and which\nfirst smiled with benignant victory; when the terrible African rode\nthrough the Latian cities, like a fire through the pitchy pines, or the\neast wind through the Sicilian waves. After this the Roman youth\nincreased continually in successful exploits, and temples, laid waste by\nthe impious outrage of the Carthaginians, had the [statues of] their\ngods set up again.

Should you sink it in the depth, it will come out more\nbeautiful: should you contend with it, with great glory will it\noverthrow the conqueror unhurt before, and will fight battles to be the\ntalk of wives. No longer can I send boasting messengers to Carthage: all\nthe hope and success of my name is fallen, is fallen by the death of\nAsdrubal.

        "But oh, by all the gods in heaven, who rule the earth and human race,\nwhat means this tumult? And what the hideous looks of all these [hags,\nfixed] upon me alone? I conjure thee by thy children (if invoked Lucina\nwas ever present at any real birth of thine), I [conjure] thee by this\nempty honor of my purple, by Jupiter, who must disapprove these\nproceedings, why dost thou look at me as a step-mother, or as a wild\nbeast stricken with a dart? While the boy made these complaints with a\nfaltering voice, he stood with his bandages of distinction taken from\nhim, a tender frame, such as might soften the impious breasts of the\ncruel Thracians; Canidia, having interwoven her hair and uncombed head\nwith little vipers, orders wild fig-trees torn up from graves, orders\nfuneral cypresses and eggs besmeared with the gore of a loathsome toad,\nand feathers of the nocturnal screech-owl, and those herbs, which\nlolchos, and Spain, fruitful in poisons, transmits, and bones snatched\nfrom the mouth of a hungry bitch, to be burned in Colchian flames. But\nSagana, tucked up for expedition, sprinkling the waters of Avernus all\nover the house, bristles up with her rough hair like a sea-urchin, or a\nboar in the chase. Veia, deterred by no remorse of conscience, groaning\nwith the toil, dug up the ground with the sharp spade; where the boy,\nfixed in, might long be tormented to death at the sight of food varied\ntwo or three times in a day: while he stood out with his face, just as\nmuch at bodies suspended by the chin [in swimming] project from the\nwater, that his parched marrow and dried liver might be a charm for\nlove; when once the pupils of his eyes had wasted away, fixed on the\nforbidden food. Both the idle Naples, and every neighboring town\nbelieved, that Folia of Ariminum, [a witch] of masculine lust, was not\nabsent: she, who with her Thessalian incantations forces the charmed\nstars and the moon from heaven. Here the fell Canidia, gnawing her\nunpaired thumb with her livid teeth, what said she? or what did she not\nsay? O ye faithful witnesses to my proceedings, Night and Diana, who\npresidest over silence, when the secret rites are celebrated: now, now\nbe present, now turn your anger and power against the houses of our\nenemies, while the savage wild beasts lie hid in the woods, dissolved in\nsweet repose; let the dogs of Suburra (which may be matter of ridicule\nfor every body) bark at the aged profligate, bedaubed with ointment,\nsuch as my hands never made any more exquisite. What is the matter? Why\nare these compositions less efficacious than those of the barbarian\nMedea? by means of which she made her escape, after having revenged\nherself on [Jason’s] haughty mistress, the daughter of the mighty Creon;\nwhen the garment, a gift that was injected with venom, took off his new\nbride by its inflammatory power. And yet no herb, nor root hidden in\ninaccessible places, ever escaped my notice. [Nevertheless,] he sleeps\nin the perfumed bed of every harlot, from his forgetfulness [of me]. Ah!\nah! he walks free [from my power] by the charms of some more knowing\nwitch. Varus, (oh you that will shortly have much to lament!) you shall\ncome back to me by means of unusual spells; nor shall you return to\nyourself by all the power of Marsian enchantments, I will prepare a\nstronger philter: I will pour in a stronger philter for you, disdainful\nas you are; and the heaven shall subside below the sea, with the earth\nextended over it, sooner than you shall not burn with love for me, in\nthe same manner as this pitch [burns] in the sooty flames. At these\nwords, the boy no longer [attempted], as before, to move the impious\nhags by soothing expressions; but, doubtful in what manner he should\nbreak silence, uttered Thyestean imprecations. Potions [said he] have a\ngreat efficacy in confounding right and wrong, but are not able to\ninvert the condition of human nature; I will persecute you with curses;\nand execrating detestation is not to be expiated by any victim.\nMoreover, when doomed to death I shall have expired, I will attend you\nas a nocturnal fury; and, a ghost, I will attack your faces with my\nhooked talons (for such is the power of those divinities, the Manes),\nand, brooding upon your restless breasts, I will deprive you of repose\nby terror. The mob, from village to village, assaulting you on every\nside with stones, shall demolish you filthy hags. Finally, the wolves\nand Esquiline vultures shall scatter abroad your unburied limbs. Nor\nshall this spectacle escape the observation of my parents, who, alas!\nmust survive me.",

You, when you have filled the grove with your fearful\nbarking, you smell at the food that is thrown to you. Have a care, have\na care; for, very bitter against bad men, I exert my ready horns uplift;\nlike him that was rejected as a son-in-law by the perfidious Lycambes,\nor the sharp enemy of Bupalus.

This custom [of warfare] never obtained even among either wolves\nor savage lions, unless against a different species. Does blind phrenzy,\nor your superior valor, or some crime, hurry you on at this rate? Give\nanswer. They are silent: and wan paleness infects their countenances,\nand their stricken souls are stupefied.

May you be happy: and may\ntriumphal statues adorn your funeral procession; and may no matron\nappear in public abounding with richer pearls. What follows, because the\nStoic treatises sometimes love to be on silken pillows? Are unlearned\nconstitutions the less robust? Or are their limbs less stout?

As lately, when the Neptunian admiral, driven from the sea,\nand his navy burned, fled, after having menaced those chains to Rome,\nwhich, like a friend, he had taken off from perfidious slaves. The Roman\nsoldiers (alas! ye, our posterity, will deny the fact), enslaved to a\nwoman, carry palisadoes and arms, and can be subservient to haggard\neunuchs; and among the military standards, oh shame! the sun beholds an\n[Egyptian] canopy.

Dost thou\ndelay the golden chariots and untouched heifers? Hail, god of triumph!\nYou neither brought back a general equal [to Caesar] from the Jugurthine\nwar; nor from the African [war, him], whose valor raised him a monument\nover Carthage. Our enemy, overthrown both by land and sea, has changed\nhis purple vestments for mourning. He either seeks Crete, famous for her\nhundred cities, ready to sail with unfavorable winds; or the Syrtes,\nharassed by the south; or else is driven by the uncertain sea.

This is the third\nDecember that has shaken the [leafy] honors from the woods, since I\nceased to be mad for Inachia. Ah me! (for I am ashamed of so great a\nmisfortune) what a subject of talk was I throughout the city! I repent\ntoo of the entertainments, at which both a languishing and silence and\nsighs, heaved from the bottom of my breast, discovered the lover. As\nsoon as the indelicate god [Bacchus] by the glowing wine had removed, as\nI grew warm, the secrets of [my heart] from their repository, I made my\ncomplaints, lamenting to you, “Has the fairest genius of a poor man no\nweight against wealthy lucre? Wherefore, if a generous indignation boil\nin my breast, insomuch as to disperse to the winds these disagreeable\napplications, that give no ease to the desperate wound; the shame [of\nbeing overcome] ending, shall cease to contest with rivals of such a\nsort.” When I, with great gravity, had applauded these resolutions in\nyour presence, being ordered to go home, I was carried with a wandering\nfoot to posts, alas! to me not friendly, and alas! obdurate gates,\nagainst which I bruised my loins and side. Now my affections for the\ndelicate Lyciscus engross all my time; from them neither the unreserved\nadmonitions, nor the serious reprehensions of other friends can recall\nme [to my former taste for poetry]; but, perhaps, either a new flame for\nsome fair damsel, or for some graceful youth who binds his long hair in\na knot, [may do so].",

What sweatiness, and how rank an odor every where\nrises from her withered limbs! when she strives to lay her furious rage\nwith impossibilities; now she has no longer the advantage of moist\ncosmetics, and her color appears as if stained with crocodile’s ordure;\nand now, in wild impetuosity, she tears her bed, bedding, and all she\nhas.

There can be no determination better than this; namely, to go\nwherever our feet will carry us, wherever the south or boisterous\nsouth-west shall summon us through the waves; in the same manner as the\nstate of the Phocaeans fled, after having uttered execrations [against\nsuch as should return], and left their fields and proper dwellings and\ntemples to be inhabited by boars and ravenous wolves.

There\nthe she-goats come to the milk-pails of their own accord, and the\nfriendly flock return with their udders distended; nor does the bear at\nevening growl about the sheepfold, nor does the rising ground swell with\nvipers; and many more things shall we, happy [Romans], view with\nadmiration: how neither the rainy east lays waste the corn-fields with\nprofuse showers, nor is the fertile seed burned by a dry glebe; the king\nof gods moderating both [extremes]. The pine rowed by the Argonauts\nnever attempted to come hither; nor did the lascivious [Medea] of\nColchis set her foot [in this place]: hither the Sidonian mariners never\nturned their sail-yards, nor the toiling crew of Ulysses.

But further, that I may not run over\nthis in a laughing manner, like those [who treat] on ludicrous subjects\n(though what hinders one being merry, while telling the truth? as\ngood-natured teachers at first give cakes to their boys, that they may\nbe willing to learn their first rudiments: railery, however, apart, let\nus investigate serious matters). He that turns the heavy glebe with the\nhard ploughshare, this fraudulent tavern-keeper, the soldier, and the\nsailors, who dauntless run through every sea, profess that they endure\ntoil with this intention, that as old men they may retire into a secure\nresting place, when once they have gotten together a sufficient\nprovision.",
        "Thus the little ant (for she is an example), of great industry, carries\nin her mouth whatever she is able, and adds to the heap which she piles\nup, by no means ignorant and not careless for the future. Which [ant,\nnevertheless], as soon, as Aquarius saddens the changed year, never\ncreeps abroad, but wisely makes use of those stores which were provided\nbeforehand: while neither sultry summer, nor winter, fire, ocean, sword,\ncan drive you from gain. You surmount every obstacle, that no other man\nmay be richer than yourself. What pleasure is it for you, trembling to\ndeposit an immense weight of silver and gold in the earth dug up by\nstealth? Because if you lessen it, it may be reduced to a paltry\nfarthing.",
        "But unless that be the case, what beauty has an accumulated hoard?\nThough your thrashing-floor should yield a hundred thousand bushels of\ncorn, your belly will not on that account contain more than mine: just\nas if it were your lot to carry on your loaded shoulder the basket of\nbread among slaves, you would receive no more [for your own share] than\nhe who bore no part of the burthen. Or tell me, what is it to the\npurpose of that man, who lives within the compass of nature, whether he\nplow a hundred or a thousand acres?",
        "“But it is still delightful to take out of a great hoard.”",
        "While you leave us to take as much out of a moderate store, why should\nyou extol your granaries, more than our corn-baskets? As if you had\noccasion for no more than a pitcher or glass of water, and should say,\n\"I had rather draw [so much] from a great river, than the very same\nquantity from this little fountain.” Hence it comes to pass, that the\nrapid Aufidus carries away, together with the bank, such men as an\nabundance more copious than what is just delights. But he who desires\nonly so much as is sufficient, neither drinks water fouled with the mud,\nnor loses his life in the waves.",
        "But a great majority of mankind, misled by a wrong desire cry, “No sum\nis enough; because you are esteemed in proportion to what you possess.\"\nWhat can one do to such a tribe as this? Why, bid them be wretched,\nsince their inclination prompts them to it. As a certain person is\nrecorded [to have lived] at Athens, covetous and rich, who was wont to\ndespise the talk of the people in this manner: “The crowd hiss me; but I\napplaud myself at home, as soon as I contemplate my money in my chest.\"\nThe thirsty Tantalus catches at the streams, which elude his lips. Why\ndo you laugh? The name changed, the tale is told of you.

Are you ignorant of what\nvalue money has, what use it can afford? Bread, herbs, a bottle of wine\nmay be purchased; to which [necessaries], add [such others], as, being\nwithheld, human nature would be uneasy with itself. What, to watch half\ndead with terror, night and day, to dread profligate thieves, fire, and\nyour slaves, lest they should run away and plunder you; is this\ndelightful? I should always wish to be very poor in possessions held\nupon these terms.",
        "But if your body should be disordered by being seized with a cold, or\nany other casualty should confine you to your bed, have you one that\nwill abide by you, prepare medicines, entreat the physician that he\nwould set you upon your feet, and restore you to your children and dear\nrelations?",
        "Neither your wife, nor your son, desires your recovery; all your\nneighbors, acquaintances, [nay the very] boys and girls hate you. Do you\nwonder that no one tenders you the affection which you do not merit,\nsince you prefer your money to everything else? If you think to retain,\nand preserve as friends, the relations which nature gives you, without\ntaking any pains; wretch that you are, you lose your labor equally, as\nif any one should train an ass to be obedient to the rein, and run in\nthe Campus [Martius]. Finally, let there be some end to your search;\nand, as your riches increase, be in less dread of poverty; and begin to\ncease from your toil, that being acquired which you coveted: nor do as\ndid one Umidius (it is no tedious story), who was so rich that he\nmeasured his money, so sordid that he never clothed him self any better\nthan a slave; and, even to his last moments, was in dread lest want of\nbread should oppress him: but his freed-woman, the bravest of all the\ndaughters of Tyndarus, cut him in two with a hatchet.",

        "You are going [now] to make things tally, that are contradictory in\ntheir natures. When I bid you not be a miser, I do not order you to\nbecome a debauchee or a prodigal. There is some difference between the\ncase of Tanais and his son-in-law Visellius, there is a mean in things;\nfinally, there are certain boundaries, on either side of which moral\nrectitude can not exist. I return now whence I digressed. Does no one,\nafter the miser’s example, like his own station, but rather praise those\nwho have different pursuits; and pines, because his neighbor’s she-goat\nbears a more distended udder: nor considers himself in relation to the\ngreater multitude of poor; but labors to surpass, first one and then\nanother? Thus the richer man is always an obstacle to one that is\nhastening [to be rich]: as when the courser whirls along the chariot\ndismissed from the place of starting; the charioteer presses upon those\nhorses which outstrip his own, despising him that is left behind coming\non among the last. Hence it is, that we rarely find a man who can say he\nhas lived happy, and content with his past life, can retire from the\nworld like a satisfied guest. Enough for the present: nor will I add one\nword more, lest you should suspect that I have plundered the escrutoire\nof the blear-eyed Crispinus.",
        "SATIRE II.",
        "Bad men, when they avoid certain vices, fall into their opposite\nextremes.\nThe tribes of female flute-players, quacks, vagrants, mimics,\nblackguards; all this set is sorrowful and dejected on account of the\ndeath of the singer Tigellius; for he was liberal [toward them]. On the\nother hand, this man, dreading to be called a spendthrift, will not give\na poor friend wherewithal to keep off cold and pinching hunger. If you\nask him why he wickedly consumes the noble estate of his grandfather and\nfather in tasteless gluttony, buying with borrowed money all sorts of\ndainties; he answers, because he is unwilling to be reckoned sordid, or\nof a mean spirit: he is praised by some, condemned by others. Fufidius,\nwealthy in lands, wealthy in money put out at interest, is afraid of\nhaving the character of a rake and spendthrift. This fellow deducts 5\nper cent. Interest from the principal [at the time of lending]; and, the\nmore desperate in his circumstances any one is, the more severely be\npinches him: he hunts out the names of young fellows that have just put\non the toga virilis under rigid fathers. Who does not cry out, O\nsovereign Jupiter! when he has heard [of such knavery]? But [you will\nsay, perhaps,] this man expends upon himself in proportion to his gain.\nYou can hardly believe how little a friend he is to himself: insomuch\nthat the father, whom Terence’s comedy introduces as living miserable\nafter he had caused his son to run away from him, did not torment\nhimself worse than he. Now if any one should ask, “To what does this\nmatter tend?” To this: while fools shun [one sort of] vices, they fall\nupon their opposite extremes. Malthinus walks with his garments trailing\nupon the ground; there is another droll fellow who [goes] with them\ntucked up even to his middle; Rufillus smells like perfume itself,\nGorgonius like a he-goat. There is no mean. There are some who would not\nkeep company with a lady, unless her modest garment perfectly conceal\nher feet. Another, again, will only have such as take their station in a\nfilthy brothel. When a certain noted spark came out of a stew, the\ndivine Cato [greeted] him with this sentence: “Proceed (says he) in your\nvirtuous course. For, when once foul lust has inflamed the veins, it is\nright for young fellows to come hither, in comparison of their meddling\nwith other men’s wives.” I should not be willing to be commended on such\nterms, says Cupiennius, an admirer of the silken vail.",
        "Ye, that do not wish well to the proceedings of adulterers, it is worth\nyour while to hear how they are hampered on all sides; and that their\npleasure, which happens to them but seldom, is interrupted with a great\ndeal of pain, and often in the midst of very great dangers. One has\nthrown himself headlong from the top of a house; another has been\nwhipped almost to death: a third, in his flight, has fallen into a\nmerciless gang of thieves: another has paid a fine, [to avoid] corporal\n[punishment]: the lowest servants have treated another with the vilest\nindignities. Moreover, this misfortune happened to a certain person, he\nentirely lost his manhood. Every body said, it was with justice: Galba\ndenied it.",
        "But how much safer is the traffic among [women] of the second rate! I\nmean the freed-women: after which Sallustius is not less mad, than he\nwho commits adultery. But if he had a mind to be good and generous, as\nfar as his estate and reason would direct him, and as far as a man might\nbe liberal with moderation; he would give a sufficiency, not what would\nbring upon himself ruin and infamy. However, he hugs himself in this one\n[consideration]; this he delights in, this he extols: “I meddle with no\nmatron.” Just as Marsaeus, the lover of Origo, he who gives his paternal\nestate and seat to an actress, says, “I never meddle with other men’s\nwives.” But you have with actresses, you have with common strumpets:\nwhence your reputation derives a greater perdition, than your estate.\nWhat, is it abundantly sufficient to avoid the person, and not the\n[vice] which is universally noxious? To lose one’s good name, to\nsquander a father’s effects, is in all cases an evil. What is the\ndifference [then, with regard to yourself,] whether you sin with the\nperson of a matron, a maiden, or a prostitute?",
        "Villius, the son-in-law of Sylla (by this title alone he was misled),\nsuffered [for his commerce] with Fausta, an adequate and more than\nadequate punishment, by being drubbed and stabbed, while he was shut\nout, that Longarenus might enjoy her within. Suppose this [young man’s]\nmind had addressed him in the words of his appetite, perceiving such\nevil consequences: “What would you have? Did I ever, when my ardor was\nat the highest, demand a woman descended from a great consul, and\ncovered with robes of quality?” What could he answer? Why, “the girl was\nsprung from an illustrious father.” But how much better things, and how\ndifferent from this, does nature, abounding in stores of her own,\nrecommend; if you would only make a proper use of them, and not confound\nwhat is to be avoided with that which is desirable! Do you think it is\nof no consequence, whether your distresses arise from your own fault or\nfrom [a real deficiency] of things? Wherefore, that you may not repent\n[when it is too late], put a stop to your pursuit after matrons; whence\nmore trouble is derived, than you can obtain of enjoyment from success.\nNor has [this particular matron], amid her pearls and emeralds, a softer\nthigh, or-limbs mere delicate than yours, Cerinthus; nay, the\nprostitutes are frequently preferable. Add to this, that [the\nprostitute] bears about her merchandize without any varnish, and openly\nshows what she has to dispose of; nor, if she has aught more comely than\nordinary, does she boast and make an ostentation of it, while she is\nindustrious to conceal that which is offensive. This is the custom with\nmen of fortune: when they buy horses, they inspect them covered: that,\nif a beautiful forehand (as often) be supported by a tender hoof, it may\nnot take in the buyer, eager for the bargain, because the back is\nhandsome, the head little, and the neck stately. This they do\njudiciously. Do not you, [therefore, in the same manner] contemplate the\nperfections of each [fair one’s] person with the eyes of Lynceus; but be\nblinder than Hypsaea, when you survey such parts as are deformed. [You\nmay cry out,] “O what a leg! O, what delicate arms!” But [you suppress]\nthat she is low-hipped, short-waisted, with a long nose, and a splay\nfoot. A man can see nothing but the face of a matron, who carefully\nconceals her other charms, unless it be a Catia. But if you will seek\nafter forbidden charms (for the [circumstance of their being forbidden]\nmakes you mad after them), surrounded as they are with a fortification,\nmany obstacles will then be in your way: such as guardians, the sedan,\ndressers, parasites, the long robe hanging down to the ankles, and\ncovered with an upper garment; a multiplicity of circumstances, which\nwill hinder you from having a fair view. The other throws no obstacle in\nyour way; through the silken vest you may discern her, almost as well as\nif she was naked; that she has neither a bad leg, nor a disagreeable\nfoot, you may survey her form perfectly with your eye. Or would you\nchoose to have a trick put upon you, and your money extorted, before the\ngoods are shown you? [But perhaps you will sing to me these verses out\nof Callimachus.] As the huntsman pursues the hare in the deep snow, but\ndisdains to touch it when it is placed before him: thus sings the rake,\nand applies it to himself; my love is like to this, for it passes over\nan easy prey, and pursues what flies from it. Do you hope that grief,\nand uneasiness, and bitter anxieties, will be expelled from your breast\nby such verses as these? Would It not be more profitable to inquire what\nboundary nature has affixed to the appetites, what she can patiently do\nwithout, and what she would lament the deprivation of, and to separate\nwhat is solid from what is vain? What! when thirst parches your jaws,\nare you solicitous for golden cups to drink out of? What! when you are\nhungry, do you despise everything but peacock and turbot? When your\npassions are inflamed, and a common gratification is at hand, would you\nrather be consumed with desire than possess it? I would not: for I love\nsuch pleasures as are of easiest attainment. But she whose language is,\n\"By and by,” “But for a small matter more,” “If my husband should be out\nof the way.” [is only] for petit-maitres: and for himself, Philodemus\nsays, he chooses her, who neither stands for a great price, nor delays\nto come when she is ordered. Let her be fair, and straight, and so far\ndecent as not to appear desirous of seeming fairer than nature has made\nher. When I am in the company of such an one, she is my Ilia and\nAegeria; I give her any name. Nor am I apprehensive, while I am in her\ncompany, lest her husband should return from the country: the door\nshould be broken open; the dog should bark; the house, shaken, should\nresound on all sides with a great noise; the woman, pale [with fear],\nshould bound away from me; lest the maid, conscious [of guilt], should\ncry out, she is undone; lest she should be in apprehension for her\nlimbs, the detected wife for her portion, I for myself: lest I must run\naway with my clothes all loose, and bare-footed, for fear my money, or\nmy person, or, finally my character should be demolished. It is a\ndreadful thing to be caught; I could prove this, even if Fabius were the\njudge.",

        "This is a fault common to all singers, that among their friends they\nnever are inclined to sing when they are asked, [but] unasked, they\nnever desist. Tigellius, that Sardinian, had this [fault]. Had Caesar,\nwho could have forced him to compliance, besought him on account of his\nfather’s friendship and his own, he would have had no success; if he\nhimself was disposed, he would chant lo Bacche over and over, from the\nbeginning of an entertainment to the very conclusion of it; one while at\nthe deepest pitch of his voice, at another time with that which answers\nto the highest string of the tetrachord. There was nothing uniform in\nthat fellow; frequently would he run along, as one flying from an enemy;\nmore frequently [he walked] as if he bore [in procession] the sacrifice\nof Juno: he had often two hundred slaves, often but ten: one while\ntalking of kings and potentates, every thing that was magnificent; at\nanother–\"Let me have a three-legged table, and a cellar of clean salt,\nand a gown which, though coarse, may be sufficient to keep out the\ncold.” Had you given ten hundred thousand sesterces to this moderate man\nwho was content with such small matters, in five days’ time there would\nbe nothing in his bags. He sat up at nights, [even] to day-light; he\nsnored out all the day. Never was there anything so inconsistent with\nitself. Now some person may say to me, “What are you? Have you no\nfaults?” Yes, others; but others, and perhaps of a less culpable nature.",
        "When Maenius railed at Novius in his absence: “Hark ye,” says a certain\nperson, “are you ignorant of yourself? or do you think to impose\nyourself upon us a person we do not know?” “As for me, I forgive\nmyself,” quoth Maenius. This is a foolish and impious self-love, and\nworthy to be stigmatized. When you look over your own vices, winking at\nthem, as it were, with sore eyes; why are you with regard to those of\nyour friends as sharp-sighted as an eagle, or the Epidaurian serpent?\nBut, on the other hand, it is your lot that your friends should inquire\ninto your vices in turn. [A certain person] is a little too hasty in his\ntemper; not well calculated for the sharp-witted sneers of these men: he\nmay be made a jest of because his gown hangs awkwardly, he [at the same\ntime] being trimmed in a very rustic manner, and his wide shoe hardly\nsticks to his foot. But he is so good, that no man can be better; but he\nis your friend; but an immense genius is concealed under this unpolished\nperson of his. Finally, sift yourself thoroughly, whether nature has\noriginally sown the seeds of any vice in you, or even an ill-habit [has\ndone it]. For the fern, fit [only] to be burned, overruns the neglected\nfields.",
        "Let us return from our digression. As his mistress’s disagreeable\nfailings escape the blinded lover, or even give him pleasure (as Hagna’s\nwen does to Balbinus), I could wish that we erred in this manner with\nregard to friendship, and that virtue had affixed a reputable\nappellation to such an error. And as a father ought not to contemn his\nson, if he has any defect, in the same manner we ought not [to contemn]\nour friend. The father calls his squinting boy a pretty leering rogue;\nand if any man has a little despicable brat, such as the abortive\nSisyphus formerly was, he calls it a sweet moppet; this [child] with\ndistorted legs, [the father] in a fondling voice calls one of the Vari;\nand another, who is club-footed, he calls a Scaurus. [Thus, does] this\nfriend of yours live more sparingly than ordinarily? Let him be styled a\nman of frugality. Is another impertinent, and apt to brag a little? He\nrequires to be reckoned entertaining to his friends. But [another] is\ntoo rude, and takes greater liberties than are fitting. Let him be\nesteemed a man of sincerity and bravery. Is he too fiery, let him be\nnumbered among persons of spirit. This method, in my opinion, both\nunites friends, and preserves them in a state of union. But we invert\nthe very virtues themselves, and are desirous of throwing dirt upon the\nuntainted vessel. Does a man of probity live among us? he is a person of\nsingular diffidence; we give him the name of a dull and fat-headed\nfellow. Does this man avoid every snare, and lay himself open to no\nill-designing villain; since we live amid such a race, where keen envy\nand accusations are flourishing? Instead of a sensible and wary man, we\ncall him a disguised and subtle fellow. And is any one more open, [and\nless reserved] than usual in such a degree as I often have presented\nmyself to you, Maecenas, so as perhaps impertinently to interrupt a\nperson reading, or musing, with any kind of prate? We cry, “[this\nfellow] actually wants common sense.” Alas! how indiscreetly do we\nordain a severe law against ourselves! For no one Is born without vices:\nhe is the best man who is encumbered with the least. When my dear\nfriend, as is just, weighs my good qualities against my bad ones, let\nhim, if he is willing to be beloved, turn the scale to the majority of\nthe former (if I have indeed a majority of good qualities), on this\ncondition, he shall be placed in the same balance. He who requires that\nhis friend should not take offence at his own protuberances, will excuse\nhis friend’s little warts. It is fair that he who entreats a pardon for\nhis own faults, should grant one in his turn.",
        "Upon the whole, forasmuch as the vice anger, as well as others inherent\nin foolish [mortals], cannot be totally eradicated, why does not human\nreason make use of its own weights and measures; and so punish faults,\nas the nature of the thing demands? If any man should punish with the\ncross, a slave, who being ordered to take away the dish should gorge\nthe half-eaten fish and warm sauce; he would, among people in their\nsenses, be called a madder man than Labeo. How much more irrational and\nheinous a crime is this! Your friend has been guilty of a small error\n(which, unless you forgive, you ought to be reckoned a sour, ill-natured\nfellow), you hate and avoid him, as a debtor does Ruso; who, when the\nwoful calends come upon the unfortunate man, unless he procures the\ninterest or capital by hook or by crook, is compelled to hear his\nmiserable stories with his neck stretched out like a slave. [Should my\nfriend] in his liquor water my couch, or has he thrown down a jar carved\nby the hands of Evander: shall he for this [trifling] affair, or because\nin his hunger he has taken a chicken before me out of my part of the\ndish, be the less agreeable friend to me? [If so], what could I do if he\nwas guilty of theft, or had betrayed things committed to him in\nconfidence, or broken his word. They who are pleased [to rank all]\nfaults nearly on an equality, are troubled when they come to the truth\nof the matter: sense and morality are against them, and utility itself,\nthe mother almost of right and of equity.",
        "When [rude] animals, they crawled forth upon the first-formed earth, the\nmute and dirty herd fought with their nails and fists for their acorn\nand caves, afterward with clubs, and finally with arms which experience\nhad forged: till they found out words and names, by which they\nascertained their language and sensations: thenceforward they began to\nabstain from war, to fortify towns, and establish laws: that no person\nshould be a thief, a robber, or an adulterer. For before Helen’s time\nthere existed [many] a woman who was the dismal cause of war: but those\nfell by unknown deaths, whom pursuing uncertain venery, as the bull in\nthe herd, the strongest slew. It must of necessity be acknowledged, if\nyou have a mind to turn over the aeras and anuals of the world, that\nlaws were invented from an apprehension of the natural injustice [of\nmankind]. Nor can nature separate what is unjust from what is just, in\nthe same manner as she distinguishes what is good from its reverse, and\nwhat is to be avoided from that which is to be sought, nor will reason\npersuade men to this, that he who breaks down the cabbage-stalk of his\nneighbor, sins in as great a measure, and in the same manner, as he who\nsteals by night things consecrated to the gods. Let there be a settled\nstandard, that may inflict adequate punishments upon crimes, lest you\nshould persecute any one with the horrible thong, who is only deserving\nof a slight whipping. For I am not apprehensive, that you should correct\nwith the rod one that deserves to suffer severer stripes: since you\nassert that pilfering is an equal crime with highway robbery, and\nthreaten that you would prune off with an undistinguishing hook little\nand great vices, if mankind were to give you the sovereignty over them.\nIf he be rich, who is wise, and a good shoemaker, and alone handsome,\nand a king, why do you wish for that which you are possessed of? You do\nnot understand what Chrysippus, the father [of your sect], says: “The\nwise man never made himself shoes nor slippers: nevertheless, the wise\nman is a shoemaker.” How so? In the same manner, though Hermogenes be\nsilent, he is a fine singer, notwithstanding, and an excellent musician:\nas the subtle [lawyer] Alfenus, after every instrument of his calling\nwas thrown aside, and his shop shut up, was [still] a barber; thus is\nthe wise man of all trades, thus is he a king. O greatest of great\nkings, the waggish boys pluck you by the beard; whom unless you restrain\nwith your staff, you will be jostled by a mob all about you, and you may\nwretchedly bark and burst your lungs in vain. Not to be tedious: while\nyou, my king, shall go to the farthing bath, and no guard shall attend\nyou, except the absurd Crispinus; my dear friends will both pardon me in\nany matter in which I shall foolishly offend, and I in turn will\ncheerfully put up with their faults; and though a private man, I shall\nlive more happily than you, a king.",

        "He apologizes for the liberties taken by satiric poets in general, and\nparticularly by himself.",
        "The poets Eupolis, and Cratinus, and Aristophanes, and others, who are\nauthors of the ancient comedy, if there was any person deserving to be\ndistinguished for being a rascal or a thief, an adulterer or a\ncut-throat, or in any shape an infamous fellow, branded him with great\nfreedom. Upon these [models] Lucilius entirely depends, having imitated\nthem, changing only their feet and numbers: a man of wit, of great\nkeenness, inelegant in the composition of verse: for in this respect he\nwas faulty; he would often, as a great feat, dictate two hundred verses\nin an hour, standing in the same position. As he flowed muddily, there\nwas [always] something that one would wish to remove; he was verbose,\nand too lazy to endure the fatigue of writing–of writing accurately:\nfor, with regard to the quantity [of his works], I make no account of\nit. See! Crispinus challenges me even for ever so little a wager. Take,\nif you dare, take your tablets, and I will take mine; let there be a\nplace, a time, and persons appointed to see fair play: let us see who\ncan write the most. The gods have done a good part by me, since they\nhave framed me of an humble and meek disposition, speaking but seldom,\nbriefly: but do you, [Crispinus,] as much as you will, imitate air which\nis shut up in leathern bellows, perpetually putting till the fire\nsoftens the iron. Fannius is a happy man, who, of his own accord, has\npresented his manuscripts and picture [to the Palatine Apollo]; when not\na soul will peruse my writings, who am afraid to rehearse in public, on\nthis account, because there are certain persons who can by no means\nrelish this kind [of satiric writing], as there are very many who\ndeserve censure. Single any man out of the crowd; he either labors under\na covetous disposition, or under wretched ambition. One is mad in love\nwith married women, another with youths; a third the splendor of silver\ncaptivates: Albius is in raptures with brass; another exchanges his\nmerchandize from the rising sun, even to that with which the western\nregions are warmed: but he is burried headlong through dangers, as dust\nwrapped up in a whirlwind; in dread lest he should lose anything out of\nthe capital, or [in hope] that he may increase his store. All these are\nafraid of verses, they hate poets. “He has hay on his horn, [they cry;]\navoid him at a great distance: if he can but raise a laugh for his own\ndiversion, he will not spare any friend: and whatever he has once\nblotted upon his paper, he will take a pleasure in letting all the boys\nand old women know, as they return from the bakehouse or the lake.” But,\ncome on, attend to a few words on the other side of the question.",
        "In the first place, I will except myself out of the number of those I\nwould allow to be poets: for one must not call it sufficient to tag a\nverse: nor if any person, like me, writes in a style bordering on\nconversation, must you esteem him to be a poet. To him who has genius,\nwho has a soul of a diviner cast, and a greatness of expression, give\nthe honor of this appellation. On this account some have raised the\nquestion, whether comedy be a poem or not; because an animated spirit\nand force is neither in the style, nor the subject-matter: bating that\nit differs from prose by a certain measure, it is mere prose. But [one\nmay object to this, that even in comedy] an inflamed father rages,\nbecause his dissolute son, mad after a prostitute mistress, refuses a\nwife with a large portion; and (what is an egregious scandal) rambles\nabout drunk with flambeaux by day-light. Yet could Pomponius, were his\nfather alive, hear less severe reproofs! Wherefore it is not sufficient\nto write verses merely in proper language; which if you take to pieces,\nany person may storm in the same manner as the father in the play. If\nfrom these verses which I write at this present, or those that Lucilius\ndid formerly, you take away certain pauses and measures, and make that\nword which was first in order hindermost, by placing the latter [words]\nbefore those that preceded [in the verse]; you will not discern the\nlimbs of a poet, when pulled in pieces, in the same manner as you would\nwere you to transpose ever so [these lines of Ennius]:",
        "    When discord dreadful bursts the brazen bars,\n    And shatters iron locks to thunder forth her wars.",
        "So far of this matter; at another opportunity [I may investigate]\nwhether [a comedy] be a true poem or not: now I shall only consider this\npoint, whether this [satiric] kind of writing be deservedly an object of\nyour suspicion. Sulcius the virulent, and Caprius hoarse with their\nmalignancy, walk [openly], and with their libels too [in their hands];\neach of them a singular terror to robbers: but if a man lives honestly\nand with clean hands, he may despise them both. Though you be like\nhighwaymen, Coelus and Byrrhus, I am not [a common accuser], like\nCaprius and Sulcius; why should you be afraid of me? No shop nor stall\nholds my books, which the sweaty hands of the vulgar and of Hermogenes\nTigellius may soil. I repeat to nobody, except my intimates, and that\nwhen I am pressed; nor any where, and before any body. There are many\nwho recite their writings in the middle of the forum; and who [do it]\nwhile bathing: the closeness of the place, [it seems,] gives melody to\nthe voice. This pleases coxcombs, who never consider whether they do\nthis to no purpose, or at an unseasonable time. But you, says he,\ndelight to hurt people, and this you do out of a mischievous\ndisposition. From what source do you throw this calumny upon me? Is any\none then your voucher, with whom I have lived? He who backbites his\nabsent friend; [nay more,] who does not defend, at another’s accusing\nhim; who affects to raise loud laughs in company, and the reputation of\na funny fellow, who can feign things he never saw; who cannot keep\nsecrets; he is a dangerous man: be you, Roman, aware of him. You may\noften see it [even in crowded companies], where twelve sup together on\nthree couches; one of which shall delight at any rate to asperse the\nrest, except him who furnishes the bath; and him too afterward in his\nliquor, when truth-telling Bacchus opens the secrets of his heart. Yet\nthis man seems entertaining, and well-bred, and frank to you, who are an\nenemy to the malignant: but do I, if I have laughed because the fop\nRufillus smells all perfumes, and Gorgonius, like a he-goat, appear\ninsidious and a snarler to you? If by any means mention happen to be\nmade of the thefts of Petillius Capitolinus in your company, you defend\nhim after your manner: [as thus,] Capitolinus has had me for a companion\nand a friend from childhood, and being applied to, has done many things\non my account: and I am glad that he lives secure in the city; but I\nwonder, notwithstanding, how he evaded that sentence. This is the very\nessence of black malignity, this is mere malice itself: which crime,\nthat it shall be far remote from my writings, and prior to them from my\nmind, I promise, if I can take upon me to promise any thing sincerely of\nmyself. If I shall say any thing too freely, if perhaps too ludicrously,\nyou must favor me by your indulgence with this allowance. For my\nexcellent father inured me to this custom, that by noting each\nparticular vice I might avoid it by the example [of others]. When he\nexhorted me that I should live thriftily, frugally, and content with\nwhat he had provided for me; don’t you see, [would he say,] how\nwretchedly the son of Albius lives? and how miserably Barrus? A strong\nlesson to hinder any one from squandering away his patrimony. When he\nwould deter me from filthy fondness for a light woman: [take care, said\nhe,] that you do not resemble Sectanus. That I might not follow\nadulteresses, when I could enjoy a lawful amour: the character cried he,\nof Trobonius, who was caught in the fact, is by no means creditable.\nThe philosopher may tell you the reasons for what is better to be\navoided, and what to be pursued. It is sufficient for me, if I can\npreserve the morality traditional from my forefathers, and keep your\nlife and reputation inviolate, so long as you stand in need of a\nguardian: so soon as age shall have strengthened your limbs and mind,\nyou will swim without cork. In this manner he formed me, as yet a boy:\nand whether he ordered me to do any particular thing: You have an\nauthority for doing this: [then] he instanced some one of the select\nmagistrates: or did he forbid me [any thing]; can you doubt, [says he,]\nwhether this thing be dishonorable, and against your interest to be\ndone, when this person and the other is become such a burning shame for\nhis bad character [on these accounts]? As a neighboring funeral\ndispirits sick gluttons, and through fear of death forces them to have\nmercy upon themselves; so other men’s disgraces often deter tender minds\nfrom vices. From this [method of education] I am clear from all such\nvices, as bring destruction along with them: by lighter foibles, and\nsuch as you may excuse, I am possessed. And even from these, perhaps, a\nmaturer age, the sincerity of a friend, or my own judgment, may make\ngreat reductions. For neither when I am in bed, or in the piazzas, am I\nwanting to myself: this way of proceeding is better; by doing such a\nthing I shall live more comfortably; by this means I shall render myself\nagreeable to my friends; such a transaction was not clever; what, shall\nI, at any time, imprudently commit any thing like it? These things I\nresolve in silence by myself. When I have any leisure, I amuse myself\nwith my papers. This is one of those lighter foibles [I was speaking\nof]: to which if you do not grant your indulgence, a numerous band of\npoets shall come, which will take my part (for we are many more in\nnumber), and, like the Jews, we will force you to come over to our\nnumerous party.",

        "Having left mighty Rome, Aricia received me in but a middling inn:\nHeliodorus the rhetorician, most learned in the Greek language, was my\nfellow-traveller: thence we proceeded to Forum-Appi, stuffed with\nsailors and surly landlords. This stage, but one for better travellers\nthan we, being laggard we divided into two; the Appian way is less\ntiresome to bad travelers. Here I, on account of the water, which was\nmost vile, proclaim war against my belly, waiting not without impatience\nfor my companions while at supper. Now the night was preparing to spread\nher shadows upon the earth, and to display the constellations in the\nheavens. Then our slaves began to be liberal of their abuse to the\nwatermen, and the watermen to our slaves. “Here bring to.” “You are\nstowing in hundreds; hold, now sure there is enough.” Thus while the\nfare is paid, and the mule fastened a whole hour is passed away. The\ncursed gnats, and frogs of the fens, drive off repose. While the\nwaterman and a passenger, well-soaked with plenty of thick wine, vie\nwith one another in singing the praises of their absent mistresses: at\nlength the passenger being fatigued, begins to sleep; and the lazy\nwaterman ties the halter of the mule, turned out a-grazing, to a stone,\nand snores, lying flat on his back. And now the day approached, when we\nsaw the boat made no way; until a choleric fellow, one of the\npassengers, leaps out of the boat, and drubs the head and sides of both\nmule and waterman with a willow cudgel. At last we were scarcely set\nashore at the fourth hour. We wash our faces and hands in thy water, O\nFeronia. Then, having dined we crawled on three miles; and arrive under\nAnxur, which is built up on rocks that look white to a great distance.\nMaecenas was to come here, as was the excellent Cocceius. Both sent\nambassadors on matters of great importance, having been accustomed to\nreconcile friends at variance. Here, having got sore eyes, I was obliged\nto use the black ointment. In the meantime came Maecenas, and Cocceius,\nand Fonteius Capito along with them, a man of perfect polish, and\nintimate with Mark Antony, no man more so.",
        "Without regret we passed Fundi, where Aufidius Luscus was praetor,\nlaughing at the honors of that crazy scribe, his praetexta, laticlave,\nand pan of incense. At our next stage, being weary, we tarry in the city\nof the Mamurrae, Murena complimenting us with his house, and Capito with\nhis kitchen.",
        "The next day arises, by much the most agreeable to all: for Plotius, and\nVarius, and Virgil met us at Sinuessa; souls more candid ones than\nwhich the world never produced, nor is there a person in the world more\nbound to them than myself. Oh what embraces, and what transports were\nthere! While I am in my senses, nothing can I prefer to a pleasant\nfriend. The village, which is next adjoining to the bridge of Campania,\naccommodated us with lodging [at night]; and the public officers with\nsuch a quantity of fuel and salt as they are obliged to [by law]. From\nthis place the mules deposited their pack-saddles at Capua betimes [in\nthe morning]. Maecenas goes to play [at tennis]; but I and Virgil to our\nrepose: for to play at tennis is hurtful to weak eyes and feeble\nconstitutions.",
        "From this place the villa of Cocceius, situated above the Caudian inns,\nwhich abounds with plenty, receives us. Now, my muse, I beg of you\nbriefly to relate the engagement between the buffoon Sarmentus and\nMessius Cicirrus; and from what ancestry descended each began the\ncontest. The illustrious race of Messius-Oscan: Sarmentus’s mistress is\nstill alive. Sprung from such families as these, they came to the\ncombat. First, Sarmentus: “I pronounce thee to have the look of a mad\nhorse.” We laugh; and Messius himself [says], “I accept your challenge:\"\nand wags his head. “O!” cries he, “if the horn were not cut off your\nforehead, what would you not do; since, maimed as you are, you bully at\nsuch a rate?” For a foul scar has disgraced the left part of Messius’s\nbristly forehead. Cutting many jokes upon his Campanian disease, and\nupon his face, he desired him to exhibit Polyphemus’s dance: that he had\nno occasion for a mask, or the tragic buskins. Cicirrus [retorted]\nlargely to these: he asked, whether he had consecrated his chain to the\nhousehold gods according to his vow; though he was a scribe, [he told\nhim] his mistress’s property in him was not the less. Lastly, he asked,\nhow he ever came to run away; such a lank meager fellow, for whom a\npound of corn [a-day] would be ample. We were so diverted, that we\ncontinued that supper to an unusual length.",
        "Hence we proceed straight on for Beneventum; where the bustling landlord\nalmost burned himself, in roasting some lean thrushes: for, the fire\nfalling through the old kitchen [floor], the spreading flame made a\ngreat progress toward the highest part of the roof. Then you might have\nseen the hungry guests and frightened slaves snatching their supper out\n[of the flames], and everybody endeavoring to extinguish the fire.",
        "After this Apulia began to discover to me her well-known mountains,\nwhich the Atabulus scorches [with his blasts]: and through which we\nshould never have crept, unless the neighboring village of Trivicus had\nreceived us, not without a smoke that brought tears into our eyes;\noccasioned by a hearth’s burning some green boughs with the leaves upon\nthem. Here, like a great fool as I was, I wait till midnight for a\ndeceitful mistress; sleep, however, overcomes me while meditating love;\nand disagreeable dreams make me ashamed of myself and every thing about\nme.",
        "Hence we were bowled away in chaises twenty-four miles, intending to\nstop at a little town, which one cannot name in a verse, but it is\neasily enough known by description. For water is sold here, though the\nworst in the world; but their bread is exceeding fine, inasmuch that the\nweary traveler is used to carry it willingly on his shoulders; for [the\nbread] at Canusium is gritty; a pitcher of water is worth no more [than\nit is here]: which place was formerly built by the valiant Diomedes.\nHere Varius departs dejected from his weeping friends.",
        "Hence we came to Rubi, fatigued: because we made a long journey, and it\nwas rendered still more troublesome by the rains. Next day the weather\nwas better, the road worse, even to the very walls of Barium that\nabounds in fish. In the next place Egnatia, which [seems to have] been\nbuilt on troubled waters, gave us occasion for jests and laughter; for\nthey wanted to persuade us, that at this sacred portal the incense\nmelted without fire. The Jew Apella may believe this, not I. For I have\nlearned [from Epicurus], that the gods dwell in a state of tranquillity;\nnor, if nature effect any wonder, that the anxious gods send it from the\nhigh canopy of the heavens.",

        "Of true nobility.",
        "Not Maecenas, though of all the Lydians that ever inhabited the Tuscan\nterritories, no one is of a nobler family than yourself; and though you\nhave ancestors both on father’s and mother’s side, that in times past\nhave had the command of mighty legions; do you, as the generality are\nwont, toss up your nose at obscure people, such as me, who has [only] a\nfreed-man for my father: since you affirm that it is of no consequence\nof what parents any man is born, so that he be a man of merit. You\npersuade yourself, with truth, that before the dominions of Tullius, and\nthe reign of one born a slave, frequently numbers of men descended from\nancestors of no rank, have both lived as men of merit, and have been\ndistinguished by the greatest honors: [while] on the other hand\nLaevinus, the descendant of that famous Valerius, by whose means\nTarquinius Superbus was expelled from his kingdom, was not a farthing\nmore esteemed [on account of his family, even] in the judgment of the\npeople, with whose disposition you are well acquainted; who often\nfoolishly bestow honors on the unworthy, and are from their stupidity\nslaves to a name: who are struck with admiration by inscriptions and\nstatues. What is it fitting for us to do, who are far, very far removed\nfrom the vulgar [in our sentiments]? For grant it, that the people had\nrather confer a dignity on Laevinus than on Decius, who is a new man;\nand the censor Appius would expel me [the senate-house], because I was\nnot sprung from a sire of distinction: and that too deservedly, inasmuch\nas I rested not content in my own condition. But glory drags in her\ndazzling car the obscure as closely fettered as those of nobler birth.\nWhat did it profit you, O Tullius, to resume the robe that you [were\nforced] to lay aside, and become a tribune [again]? Envy increased upon\nyou, which had been less, it you had remained in a private station. For\nwhen any crazy fellow has laced the middle of his leg with the sable\nbuskins, and has let flow the purple robe from his breast, he\nimmediately hears: “Who is this man? Whose son is he?” Just as if there\nbe any one, who labors under the same distemper as Barrus does, so that\nhe is ambitious of being reckoned handsome; let him go where he will, he\nexcites curiosity among the girls of inquiring into particulars; as what\nsort of face, leg, foot, teeth, hair, he has. Thus he who engages to his\ncitizens to take care of the city, the empire, and Italy, and the\nsanctuaries of the gods, forces every mortal to be solicitous, and to\nask from what sire he is descended, or whether he is base by the\nobscurity of his mother. What? do you, the son of a Syrus, a Dana, or a\nDionysius, dare to cast down the citizens of Rome from the [Tarpeian]\nrock, or deliver them up to Cadmus [the executioner]? But, [you may\nsay,] my colleague Novius sits below me by one degree: for he is only\nwhat my father was. And therefore do you esteem yourself a Paulus or a\nMessala? But he (Novius), if two hundred carriages and three funerals\nwere to meet in the forum, could make noise enough to drown all their\nhorns and trumpets: this [kind of merit] at least has its weight with\nus.",
        "Now I return to myself, who am descended from a freed-man; whom every\nbody nibbles at, as being descended from a freed-man. Now, because,\nMaecenas, I am a constant guest of yours; but formerly, because a Roman\nlegion was under my command, as being a military tribune. This latter\ncase is different from the former: for, though any person perhaps might\njustly envy me that post of honor, yet could he not do so with regard to\nyour being my friend! especially as you are cautious to admit such as\nare worthy; and are far from having any sinister ambitious views. I can\nnot reckon myself a lucky fellow on this account, as if it were by\naccident that I got you for my friend; for no kind of accident threw you\nin my way. That best of men, Virgil, long ago, and after him, Varius,\ntold you what I was. When first I came into your presence, I spoke a few\nwords in a broken manner (for childish bashfulness hindered me from\nspeaking more); I did not tell you that I was the issue of an\nillustrious father: I did not [pretend] that I rode about the country on\na Satureian horse, but plainly what I really was; you answer (as your\ncustom is) a few words: I depart: and you re-invite me after the ninth\nmonth, and command me to be in the number of your friends. I esteem it a\ngreat thing that I pleased you, who distinguish probity from baseness,\nnot by the illustriousness of a father, but by the purity of heart and\nfeelings.",
        "And yet if my disposition be culpable for a few faults, and those small\nones, otherwise perfect (as if you should condemn moles scattered over a\nbeautiful skin), if no one can justly lay to my charge avarice, nor\nsordidness, nor impure haunts; if, in fine (to speak in my own praise),\nI live undefiled, and innocent, and dear to my friends; my father was\nthe cause of all this: who though a poor man on a lean farm, was\nunwilling to send me to a school under [the pedant] Flavius, where great\nboys, sprung from great centurions, having their satchels and tablets\nswung over their left arm, used to go with money in their hands the very\nday it was due; but had the spirit to bring me a child to Rome, to be\ntaught those arts which any Roman knight and senator can teach his own\nchildren. So that, if any person had considered my dress, and the slaves\nwho attended me in so populous a city, he would have concluded that\nthose expenses were supplied to me out of some hereditary estate. He\nhimself, of all others the most faithful guardian, was constantly about\nevery one of my preceptors. Why should I multiply words? He preserved me\nchaste (which is the first honor or virtue) not only from every actual\nguilt, but likewise from [every] foul imputation, nor was he afraid lest\nany should turn it to his reproach, if I should come to follow a\nbusiness attended with small profits, in capacity of an auctioneer, or\n(what he was himself) a tax-gatherer. Nor [had that been the case]\nshould I have complained. On this account the more praise is due to him,\nand from me a greater degree of gratitude. As long as I am in my senses,\nI can never be ashamed of such a father as this, and therefore shall not\napologize [for my birth], in the manner that numbers do, by affirming it\nto be no fault of theirs. My language and way of thinking is far\ndifferent from such persons. For if nature were to make us from a\ncertain term of years to go over our past time again, and [suffer us] to\nchoose other parents, such as every man for ostentation’s sake would\nwish for himself; I, content with my own, would not assume those that\nare honored with the ensigns and seats of state; [for which I should\nseem] a madman in the opinion of the mob, but in yours, I hope a man of\nsense; because I should be unwilling to sustain a troublesome burden,\nbeing by no means used to it. For I must [then] immediately set about\nacquiring a larger fortune, and more people must be complimented; and\nthis and that companion must be taken along, so that I could neither\ntake a jaunt into the country, or a journey by myself; more attendants\nand more horses must be fed; coaches must be drawn. Now, if I please, I\ncan go as far as Tarentum on my bob-tail mule, whose loins the\nportmanteau galls with his weight, as does the horseman his shoulders.\nNo one will lay to my charge such sordidness as he may, Tullius, to you,\nwhen five slaves follow you, a praetor, along the Tiburtian way,\ncarrying a traveling kitchen, and a vessel of wine. Thus I live more\ncomfortably, O illustrious senator, than you, and than thousands of\nothers. Wherever I have a fancy, I walk by myself: I inquire the price\nof herbs and bread; I traverse the tricking circus, and the forum often\nin the evening: I stand listening among the fortune-tellers: thence I\ntake myself home to a plate of onions, pulse, and pancakes. My supper is\nserved up by three slaves; and a white stone slab supports two cups and\na brimmer: near the salt-cellar stands a homely cruet with a little\nbowl, earthen-ware from Campania. Then I go to rest; by no means\nconcerned that I must rise in the morning, and pay a visit to the statue\nof Marsyas, who denies that he is able to bear the look of the younger\nNovius. I lie a-bed to the fourth hour; after that I take a ramble, or\nhaving read or written what may amuse me in my privacy, I am anointed\nwith oil, but not with such as the nasty Nacca, when he robs the lamps.\nBut when the sun, become more violent, has reminded me to go to bathe, I\navoid the Campus Martius and the game of hand-ball. Having dined in a\ntemperate manner, just enough to hinder me from having an empty stomach,\nduring the rest of the day I trifle in my own house. This is the life of\nthose who are free from wretched and burthensome ambition: with such\nthings as these I comfort myself, in a way to live more delightfully\nthan if my grandfather had been a quaestor, and father and uncle too.",

This Persius, being a man of fortune, had very great business\nat Clazomenae, and, into the bargain, certain troublesome litigations\nwith King; a hardened fellow, and one who was able to exceed even King\nin virulence; confident, blustering, of such a bitterness of speech,\nthat he would outstrip the Sisennae and Barri, if ever so well equipped.",

If discord sets two cowards to work; or if an engagement\nhappens between two that are not of a match, as that of Diomed and the\nLycian Glaucus; the worst man will walk off, [buying his peace] by\nvoluntarily sending presents), when Brutus held as praetor the fertile\nAsia, this pair, Rupilius and Persius, encountered; in such a manner,\nthat [the gladiators] Bacchius and Bithus were not better matched.\nImpetuous they hurry to the cause, each of them a fine sight.",

The blood was poured into a ditch, that thence\nthey might charm out the shades of the dead, ghosts that were to give\nthem answers. There was a woolen effigy too, another of wax: the woolen\none larger, which was to inflict punishment on the little one.

        "Here there was an opportunity of interrupting him. “Have you a mother,\n[or any] relations that are interested in your welfare?” “Not one have\nI; I have buried them all.” “Happy they! now I remain. Dispatch me: for\nthe fatal moment is at hand, which an old Sabine sorceress, having\nshaken her divining urn, foretold when I was a boy; ’This child, neither\nshall cruel poison, nor the hostile sword, nor pleurisy, nor cough, nor\nthe crippling gout destroy: a babbler shall one day demolish him; if he\nbe wise, let him avoid talkative people, as soon as he comes to man’s\nestate.’”",
        "One fourth of the day being now passed, we came to Vesta’s temple; and,\nas good luck would have it, he was obliged to appear to his\nrecognizance; which unless he did, he must have lost his cause. “If you\nlove me,” said he, “step in here a little.” “May I die! if I be either\nable to stand it out, or have any knowledge of the civil laws: and\nbesides, I am in a hurry, you know whither.” “I am in doubt what I shall\ndo,” said he; “whether desert you or my cause.” “Me, I beg of you.” “I\nwill not do it,” said he; and began to take the lead of me. I (as it is\ndifficult to contend with one’s master) follow him. “How stands it with\nMaecenas and you?” Thus he begins his prate again. “He is one of few\nintimates, and of a very wise way of thinking. No man ever made use of\nopportunity with more cleverness. You should have a powerful assistant,\nwho could play an underpart, if you were disposed to recommend this man;\nmay I perish, if you should not supplant all the rest!” “We do not live\nthere in the manner you imagine; there is not a house that is freer or\nmore remote from evils of this nature. It is never of any disservice to\nme, that any particular person is wealthier or a better scholar than I\nam: every individual has his proper place.” “You tell me a marvelous\nthing, scarcely credible.” “But it is even so.” “You the more inflame my\ndesires to be near his person.” “You need only be inclined to it: such\nis your merit, you will accomplish it: and he is capable of being won;\nand on that account the first access to him he makes difficult.” “I will\nnot be wanting to myself: I will corrupt his servants with presents; if\nI am excluded to-day, I will not desist; I will seek opportunities; I\nwill meet him in the public streets; I will wait upon him home. Life\nallows nothing to mortals without great labor.” While he was running on\nat this rate, lo! Fuscus Aristius comes up, a dear friend of mine, and\none who knows the fellow well. We make a stop. “Whence come you? whither\nare you going?” he asks and answers. I began to twitch him [by the\nelbow], and to take hold of his arms [that were affectedly] passive,\nnodding and distorting my eyes, that he might rescue me. Cruelly arch\nhe laughs, and pretends not to take the hint: anger galled my liver.\n\"Certainly,” [said I, “Fuscus,] you said that you wanted to communicate\nsomething to me in private.” “I remember it very well; but will tell it\nyou at a better opportunity: to-day is the thirtieth sabbath. Would you\naffront the circumcised Jews?” I reply, “I have no scruple [on that\naccount].” “But I have: I am something weaker, one of the multitude. You\nmust forgive me: I will speak with you on another occasion.” And has\nthis sun arisen so disastrous upon me! The wicked rogue runs away, and\nleaves me under the knife. But by luck his adversary met him: and,\n\"Whither are you going, you infamous fellow?” roars he with a loud\nvoice: and, “Do you witness the arrest?” I assent. He hurries him into\ncourt: there is a great clamor on both sides, a mob from all parts. Thus\nApollo preserved me.",

        "He supports the judgment which he had before given of Lucilius, and\nintersperses some excellent precepts for the writing of Satire.\nTo be sure I did say, that the verses of Lucilius did not run smoothly.\nWho is so foolish an admirer of Lucilius, that he would not own this?\nBut the same writer is applauded in the same Satire, on account of his\nhaving lashed the town with great humor. Nevertheless granting him this,\nI will not therefore give up the other [considerations]; for at that\nrate I might even admire the farces of Laberius, as fine poems. Hence it\nis by no means sufficient to make an auditor grim with laughter: and yet\nthere is some degree of merit even in this. There is need of conciseness\nthat the sentence may run, and not embarrass itself with verbiage, that\noverloads the sated ear; and sometimes a grave, frequently jocose style\nis necessary, supporting the character one while of the orator and [at\nanother] of the poet, now and then that of a graceful rallier that curbs\nthe force of his pleasantry and weakens it on purpose. For ridicule\noften decides matters of importance more effectually and in a better\nmanner, than severity. Those poets by whom the ancient comedy was\nwritten, stood upon this [foundation], and in this are they worthy of\nimitation: whom neither the smooth-faced Hermogenes ever read, nor that\nbaboon who is skilled in nothing but singing [the wanton compositions\nof] Calvus and Catullus.",
        "But [Lucilius, say they,] did a great thing, when he intermixed Greek\nwords with Latin. O late-learned dunces! What! do you think that arduous\nand admirable, which was done by Pitholeo the Rhodian? But [still they\ncry] the style elegantly composed of both tongues is the more pleasant,\nas if Falernian wine is mixed with Chian. When you make verses, I ask\nyou this question; were you to undertake the difficult cause of the\naccused Petillius, would you (for instance), forgetful of your country\nand your father, while Pedius, Poplicola, and Corvinus sweat through\ntheir causes in Latin, choose to intermix words borrowed from abroad,\nlike the double-tongued Canusinian. And as for myself, who was born on\nthis side the water, when I was about making Greek verses; Romulus\nappearing to me after midnight, when dreams are true, forbade me in\nwords to this effect; “You could not be guilty of more madness by\ncarrying timber into a wood, than by desiring to throng in among the\ngreat crowds of Grecian writers.”",
        "While bombastical Alpinus murders Memnon, and while he deforms the muddy\nsource of the Rhine, I amuse myself with these satires; which can\nneither be recited in the temple [of Apollo], as contesting for the\nprize when Tarpa presides as judge, nor can have a run over and over\nagain represented in the theatres. You, O Fundanius, of all men\nbreathing are the most capable of prattling tales in a comic vein, how\nan artful courtesan and a Davus impose upon an old Chremes. Pollio sings\nthe actions of kings in iambic measure; the sublime Varias composes the\nmanly epic, in a manner that no one can equal: to Virgil the Muses,\ndelighting in rural scenes, have granted the delicate and the elegant.\nIt was this kind [of satiric writing], the Aticinian Varro and some\nothers having attempted it without success, in which I may have some\nslight merit, inferior to the inventor: nor would I presume to pull off\nthe [laurel] crown placed upon his brow with great applause.",
        "But I said that he flowed muddily, frequently indeed bearing along more\nthings which ought to be taken away than left. Be it so; do you, who are\na scholar, find no fault with any thing in mighty Homer, I pray? Does\nthe facetious Lucilius make no alterations in the tragedies of Accius?\nDoes not he ridicule many of Ennius’ verses, which are too light for\nthe gravity [of the subject]? When he speaks of himself by no means as\nsuperior to what he blames. What should hinder me likewise, when I am\nreading the works of Lucilius, from inquiring whether it be his\n[genius], or the difficult nature of his subject, that will not suffer\nhis verses to be more finished, and to run more smoothly than if some\none, thinking it sufficient to conclude a something of six feet, be fond\nof writing two hundred verses before he eats, and as many after supper?\nSuch was the genius of the Tuscan Cassius, more impetuous than a rapid\nriver; who, as it is reported, was burned [at the funeral pile] with his\nown books and papers. Let it be allowed, I say, that Lucilius was a\nhumorous and polite writer; that he was also more correct than [Ennius],\nthe author of a kind of poetry [not yet] well cultivated, nor attempted\nby the Greeks, and [more correct likewise] than the tribe of our old\npoets: but yet he, if he had been brought down by the Fates to this age\nof ours, would have retrenched a great deal from his writings: he would\nhave pruned off every thing that transgressed the limits of perfection;\nand, in the composition of verses, would often have scratched his head,\nand bit his nails to the quick.",
        "You that intend to write what is worthy to be read more than once, blot\nfrequently: and take no-pains to make the multitude admire you, content\nwith a few [judicious] readers. What, would you be such a fool as to be\nambitious that your verses should be taught in petty schools? That is\nnot my case. It is enough for me, that the knight [Maecenas] applauds:\nas the courageous actress, Arbuscula, expressed herself, in contempt of\nthe rest of the audience, when she was hissed [by the populace]. What,\nshall that grubworm Pantilius have any effect upon me? Or can it vex me,\nthat Demetrius carps at me behind my back? or because the trifler\nFannius, that hanger-on to Hermogenes Tigellius, attempts to hurt me?\nMay Plotius and Varius, Maecenas and Virgil, Valgius and Octavius\napprove these Satires, and the excellent Fuscus likewise; and I could\nwish that both the Visci would join in their commendations: ambition\napart, I may mention you, O Pollio: you also, Messala, together with\nyour brother; and at the same time, you, Bibulus and Servius; and along\nwith these you, candid Furnius; many others whom, though men of learning\nand my friends, I purposely omit–to whom I would wish these Satires,\nsuch as they are, may give satisfaction; and I should be chagrined, if\nthey pleased in a degree below my expectation. You, Demetrius, and you,\nTigellius, I bid lament among the forms of your female pupils.",

        "There are some persons to whom I seem too severe in [the writing of]\nsatire, and to carry it beyond proper bounds: another set are of\nopinion, that all I have written is nerveless, and that a thousand\nverses like mine may be spun out in a day. Trebatius, give me your\nadvice, what shall I do. Be quiet. I should not make, you say, verses at\nall. I do say so. May I be hanged, if that would not be best: but I can\nnot sleep. Let those, who want sound sleep, anointed swim thrice across\nthe Tiber: and have their clay well moistened with wine over-night.

Nevertheless you may describe him just and brave, as the wise\nLucilius did Scipio. I will not be wanting to myself, when an\nopportunity presents itself: no verses of Horace’s, unless well-timed,\nwill gain the attention of Caesar; whom, [like a generous steed,] if you\nstroke awkwardly, he will kick upon you, being at all quarters on his\nguard. How much better would this be, than to wound with severe satire\nPantolabus the buffoon, and the rake Nomentanus! when every body is\nafraid for himself, [lest he should be the next,] and hates you, though\nhe is not meddled with. What shall I do? Milonius falls a dancing the\nmoment he becomes light-headed and warm, and the candles appear\nmultiplied. Castor delights in horsemanship: and he, who sprang from the\nsame egg, in boxing. As many thousands of people [as there are in the\nworld], so many different inclinations are there. It delights me to\ncombine words in meter, after the manner of Lucilius, a better man than\nboth of us. He long ago communicated his secrets to his books, as to\nfaithful friends; never having recourse elsewhere, whether things went\nwell or ill with him: whence it happens, that the whole life of this old\n[poet] is as open to the view, as if it had been painted en a votive\ntablet. His example I follow, though in doubt whether I am a Lucanian or\nan Apulian; for the Venusinian farmers plow upon the boundaries of both\ncountries, who (as the ancient tradition has it) were sent, on the\nexpulsion of the Samnites, for this purpose, that the enemy might not\nmake incursions on the Romans, through a vacant [unguarded frontier]: or\nlest the Apulian nation, or the fierce Lucanian, should make an\ninvasion. But this pen of mine shall not willfully attack any man\nbreathing, and shall defend me like a sword that is sheathed in the\nscabbard which why should I attempt to draw, [while I am] safe from\nhostile villains? O Jupiter, father and sovereign, may my weapon laid\naside wear away with rust, and may no one injure me, who am desirous of\npeace? But that man shall provoke me (I give notice, that it is better\nnot to touch me) shall weep [his folly], and as a notorious character\nshall be sung through all the streets of Rome.",

How every animal terrifies those whom he suspects, with\nthat in which he is most powerful, and how strong natural instinct\ncommands this, thus infer with me.–The wolf attacks with his teeth, the\nbull with his horns. From what principle is this, if not a suggestion\nfrom within? Intrust that debauchee Scaeva with the custody of his\nancient mother; his pious hand will commit no outrage. A wonder indeed!\njust as the wolf does not attack any one with his hoof, nor the bull\nwith his teeth; but the deadly hemlock in the poisoned honey will take\noff the old dame.",
        "That I may not be tedious, whether a placid old age awaits me, or\nwhether death now hovers about me with his sable wings; rich or poor, at\nRome or (if fortune should so order it) an exile abroad; whatever be the\ncomplexion of my life, I will write. O my child, I fear you can not be\nlong, lived; and that some creature of the great ones will strike you\nwith the cold of death. What? when Lucilius had the courage to be the\nfirst in composing verses after this manner, and to pull off that mask,\nby means of which each man strutted in public view with a fair outside,\nthough foul within; was Laelius, and he who derived a well deserved\ntitle from the destruction of Carthage, offended at his wit, or were\nthey hurt at Metellus being lashed, or Lupus covered over with his\nlampoons? But he took to task the heads of the people, and the people\nthemselves, class by class; in short, he spared none but virtue and her\nfriends. Yet, when the valorous Scipio, and the mild philosophical\nLaelius, had withdrawn themselves from the crowd and the public scene,\nthey used to divert themselves with him, and joke in a free manner,\nwhile a few vegetables were boiled [for supper]. Of whatever rank I am,\nthough below the estate and wit of Lucilius, yet envy must be obliged to\nown that I have lived well with great men; and, wanting to fasten her\ntooth upon some weak part, will strike it against the solid: unless you,\nlearned Trebatius, disapprove of any thing [I have said]. For my part, I\ncan not make any objection to this. But however, that forewarned you may\nbe upon your guard, lest in ignorance of our sacred laws should bring\nyou into trouble, [be sure of this] if any person shall make scandalous\nverses against a particular man, an action lies, and a sentence.\nGranted, if they are scandalous: but if a man composes good ones, and is\npraised by such a judge as Caesar? If a man barks only at him who\ndeserves his invectives, while he himself is unblamable? The process\nwill be canceled with laughter: and you, being dismissed, may depart in\npeace.",

        "What and how great is the virtue to live on a little (this is no\ndoctrine of mine, but what Ofellus the peasant, a philosopher without\nrules and of a home-spun wit, taught me), learn, my good friends, not\namong dishes and splendid tables; when the eye is dazzled with the vain\nglare, and the mind, intent upon false appearances, refuses [to admit]\nbetter things; but here, before dinner, discuss this point with me. Why\nso? I will inform you, if I can. Every corrupted judge examines badly\nthe truth. After hunting the hare, or being wearied by an unruly horse,\nor (if the Roman exercise fatigues you, accustomed to act the Greek)\nwhether the swift ball, while eagerness softens and prevents your\nperceiving the severity of the game, or quoits (smite the yielding air\nwith the quoit) when exercise has worked of squeamishness, dry and\nhungry, [then let me see you] despise mean viands; and don’t drink\nanything but Hymettian honey qualified with Falernian wine. Your butler\nis abroad, and the tempestuous sea preserves the fish by its wintery\nstorms; bread and salt will sufficiently appease an importunate stomach.\nWhence do you think this happens? and how is it obtained? The consummate\npleasure is not in the costly flavor, but in yourself. Do you seek for\nsauce by sweating. Neither oysters, nor scar, nor the far-fetched\nlagois, can give any pleasure to one bloated and pale through\nintemperance. Nevertheless, if a peacock were served up, I should hardly\nbe able to prevent your gratifying the palate with that, rather than a\npullet, since you are prejudiced by the vanities of things; because the\nscarce bird is bought with gold, and displays a fine sight with its\npainted tail, as if that were anything to the purpose. “What; do you eat\nthat plumage, which you extol? or has the bird the same beauty when\ndressed?” Since however there is no difference in the meat, in one\npreferably to the other; it is manifest that you are imposed upon by the\ndisparity of their appearances. Be it so.",
        "By what gift are you able to distinguish, whether this lupus, that now\nopens its jaws before us, was taken in the Tiber, or in the sea? whether\nit was tossed between the bridges or at the mouth of the Tuscan river?\nFool, you praise a mullet, that weighs three pounds; which you are\nobliged to cut into small pieces. Outward appearances lead you, I see.\nTo what intent then do you contemn large lupuses? Because truly these\nare by nature bulky, and those very light. A hungry stomach seldom\nloathes common victuals. O that I could see a swingeing mullet extended\non a swingeing dish! cries that gullet, which is fit for the voracious\nharpies themselves. But O [say I] ye southern blasts, be present to\ntaint the delicacies of the [gluttons]: though the boar and turbot\nnewly taken are rank, when surfeiting abundance provokes the sick\nstomach; and when the sated guttler prefers turnips and sharp\nelecampane. However, all [appearance of] poverty is not quite banished\nfrom the banquets of our nobles; for there is, even at this day, a place\nfor paltry eggs and black olives. And it was not long ago, since the\ntable of Gallonius, the auctioneer, was rendered infamous, by having a\nsturgeon, [served whole upon it]. What? was the sea at that time less\nnutritive of turbots? The turbot was secure and the stork unmolested in\nher nest; till the praetorian [Sempronius], the inventor, first taught\nyou [to eat them]. Therefore, if any one were to give it out that\nroasted cormorants are delicious, the Roman youth, teachable in\ndepravity, would acquiesce, in it.",

For it is to no purpose for you to shun that\nvice [of luxury]; if you perversely fly to the contrary extreme.\nAvidienus, to whom the nickname of Dog is applied with propriety, eats\nolives of five years old, and wild cornels, and can not bear to rack off\nhis wine unless it be turned sour, and the smell of his oil you can not\nendure: which (though clothed in white he celebrates the wedding\nfestival, his birthday, or any other festal days) he pours out himself\nby little and little from a horn cruet, that holds two pounds, upon his\ncabbage, [but at the same time] is lavish enough of his old vinegar.",
        "What manner of living therefore shall the wise man put in practice, and\nwhich of these examples shall he copy? On one side the wolf presses on,\nand the dog on the other, as the saying is. A person will be accounted\ndecent, if he offends not by sordidness, and is not despicable through\neither extreme of conduct. Such a man will not, after the example, of\nold Albutius, be savage while he assigns to his servants their\nrespective offices; nor, like simple Naevius, will he offer greasy water\nto his company: for this too is a great fault.",

In the first place, you will enjoy good health; for you may\nbelieve how detrimental a diversity of things is to any man, when you\nrecollect that sort of food, which by its simplicity sat so well upon\nyour stomach some time ago. But, when you have once mixed boiled and\nroast together, thrushes and shell-fish; the sweet juices will turn\ninto bile, and a thick phlegm will bring a jarring upon the stomach. Do\nnot you see, how pale each guest rises from a perplexing variety of\ndishes at an entertainment. Beside this, the body, overloaded with the\ndebauch of yesterday, depresses the mind along with it, and dashes to\nthe earth that portion of the divine spirit. Another man, as soon as he\nhas taken a quick repast, and rendered up his limbs to repose, rises\nvigorous to the duties of his calling. However, he may sometimes have\nrecourse to better cheer; whether the returning year shall bring on a\nfestival, or if he have a mind to refresh his impaired body; and when\nyears shall approach, and feeble age require to be used more tenderly.\nBut as for you, if a troublesome habit of body, or creeping old age,\nshould come upon you, what addition can be made to that soft indulgence,\nwhich you, now in youth and in health anticipate?",

I wish that\nthe primitive earth had produced me among such heroes as these.",
        "Have you any regard for reputation, which affects the human ear more\nagreeably than music? Great turbots and dishes bring great disgrace\nalong with them, together with expense. Add to this, that your relations\nand neighbors will be exasperated at you, while you will be at enmity\nwith yourself and desirous of death in vain, since you will not in your\npoverty have three farthings left to purchase a rope withal. Trausius,\nyou say, may with justice be called to account in such language as this;\nbut I possess an ample revenue, and wealth sufficient for three\npotentates, Why then have you no better method of expending your\nsuperfluities?

Why do not you,\nwretch that you are, bestow something on your dear country, out of so\nvast a hoard? What, will matters always go well with you alone? O thou,\nthat hereafter shalt be the great derision of thine enemies! which of\nthe two shall depend upon himself in exigences with most certainty?

        "That you may the more readily give credit to these things: I myself,\nwhen a little boy, took notice that this Ofellua did not use his\nunencumbered estate more profusely, than he does now it is reduced. You\nmay see the sturdy husbandman laboring for hire in the land [once his\nown, but now] assigned [to others], with his cattle and children,\ntalking to this effect; I never ventured to eat any thing on a work-day\nexcept pot-herbs, with a hock of smoke-dried bacon. And when a friend\ncame to visit me after a long absence, or a neighbor, an acceptable\nguest to me resting from work on account of the rain, we lived well; not\non fishes fetched from the city, but on a pullet and a kid: then a dried\ngrape, and a nut, with a large fig, set off our second course. After\nthis, it was our diversion to have no other regulation in our cups, save\nthat against drinking to excess; then Ceres worshiped [with a libation],\nthat the corn might arise in lofty stems, smoothed with wine the\nmelancholy of the contracted brow. Let fortune rage, and stir up new\ntumults what can she do more to impair my estate? How much more savingly\nhave either I lived, or how much less neatly have you gone, my children,\nsince this new possessor came? For nature has appointed to be lord of\nthis earthly property, neither him, nor me, nor any one. He drove us\nout: either iniquity or ignorance in the quirks of the law shall [do the\nsame] him: certainly in the end his long lived heir shall expel him. Now\nthis field under the denomination of Umbrenus’, lately it was Ofellus’,\nthe perpetual property of no man; for it turns to my use one while, and\nby and by to that of another.

        "You write so seldom, as not to call for parchment four times in the\nyear, busied in reforming your writings, yet are you angry with\nyourself, that indulging in wine and sleep you produce nothing worthy to\nbe the subject of conversation. What will be the consequence? But you\ntook refuge here, it seems, at the very celebration of the Saturnalia,\nout of sobriety. Dictate therefore something worthy of your promises;\nbegin. There is nothing. The pens are found fault with to no purpose,\nand the harmless wall, which must have been built under the displeasure\nof gods and poets, suffers [to no end]. But you had the look of one that\nhad threatened many and excellent things, when once your villa had\nreceived you, free from employment, under its warm roof. To what purpose\nwas it to stow Plato upon Menander? Eupolis, Archilochus? For what end\ndid you bring abroad such companions? What? are you setting about\nappeasing envy by deserting virtue? Wretch, you will be despised. That\nguilty Siren, Sloth, must be avoided; or whatever acquisitions you have\nmade in the better part of your life, must with equanimity be given up.\nMay the gods and godnesses, O Damasippus, present you with a barber for\nyour sound advice! But by what means did you get so well acquainted with\nme? Since all my fortunes were dissipated at the middle of the exchange,\ndetached from all business of my own, I mind that of other people. For\nformerly I used to take a delight in inquiring, in what vase the crafty\nSisyphus might have washed his feet; what was carved in an unworkmanlike\nmanner, and what more roughly cast than it ought to be; being a\nconnoisseur, I offered a hundred thousand sesterces for such a statue; I\nwas the only man who knew how to purchase gardens and fine seats to the\nbest advantage: whence the crowded ways gave me the surname of\nMercurial. I know it well; and am amazed at your being cured of that\ndisorder. Why a new disorder expelled the old one in a marvelous manner;\nas it is accustomed to do, when the pain of the afflicted side, or the\nhead, is turned upon the stomach; as it is with a man in a lethargy,\nwhen he turns boxer, and attacks his physician. As long as you do\nnothing like this, be it even as you please. O my good friend, do not\ndeceive yourself; you likewise are mad, and it is almost “fools all,” if\nwhat Stertinius insists upon has any truth in it; from whom, being of a\nteachable disposition, I derived these admirable precepts, at the very\ntime when, having given me consolation, he ordered me to cultivate a\nphilosophical beard, and to return cheerfully from the Fabrician bridge.\nFor when, my affairs being desperate, I had a mind to throw myself into\nthe river, having covered my head [for that purpose], he fortunately was\nat my elbow; and [addressed me to this effect]: Take care, how do any\nthing unworthy of yourself; a false shame, says he, afflicts you, who\ndread to be esteemed a madman among madmen. For in the first place, I\nwill inquire, what it is to be mad: and, if this distemper be in you\nexclusively, I will not add a single word, to prevent you from dying\nbravely.",
        "The school and sect of Chrysippus deem every man mad, whom vicious folly\nor the ignorance of truth drives blindly forward. This definition takes\nin whole nations, this even great kings, the wise man [alone] excepted.\nNow learn, why all those, who have fixed the name of madman upon you,\nare as senseless as yourself. As in the woods, where a mistake makes\npeople wander about from the proper path; one goes out of the way to the\nright, another to the left; there is the same blunder on both sides,\nonly the illusion is in different directions: in this manner imagine\nyourself mad; so that he, who derides you, hangs his tail not one jot\nwiser than yourself. There is one species of folly, that dreads things\nnot in the least formidable; insomuch that it will complain of fires,\nand rocks, and rivers opposing it in the open plain; there is another\ndifferent from this, but not a whit more approaching to wisdom, that\nruns headlong through the midst of flames and floods. Let the loving\nmother, the virtuous sister, the father, the wife, together with all the\nrelations [of a man possessed with this latter folly], cry out: “Here is\na deep ditch; here is a prodigious rock; take care of yourself:” he\nwould give no more attention, than did the drunken Fufius some time ago,\nwhen he overslept the character of Ilione, twelve hundred Catieni at the\nsame time roaring out, O mother, I call you to my aid. I will\ndemonstrate to you, that the generality of all mankind are mad in the\ncommission of some folly similar to this.",
        "Damasippus is mad for purchasing antique statues: but is Damasippus’\ncreditor in his senses? Well, suppose I should say to you: receive this,\nwhich you can never repay: will you be a madman, if you receive it; or\nwould you be more absurd for rejecting a booty, which propitious Mercury\noffers? Take bond, like the banker Nerius, for ten thousand sesterces;\nit will not signify: add the forms of Cicuta, so versed in the knotty\npoints of law: add a thousand obligations: yet this wicked Proteus will\nevade all these ties. When you shall drag him to justice, laughing as if\nhis cheeks were none of his own; he will be transformed into a boar,\nsometimes into a bird, sometimes into a stone, and when he pleases Into\na tree. If to conduct one’s affairs badly be the part of a madman; and\nthe reverse, that of a man well in his senses; brain of Perillius\n(believe me), who orders you [that sum of money], which you can never\nrepay, is much more unsound [than yours].",

        "By far the largest portion of hellebore is to be administered to the\ncovetous: I know not, whether reason does not consign all Anticyra to\ntheir use. The heirs of Staberius engraved the sum [which he left them]\nupon his tomb: unless they had acted in this manner, they were under an\nobligation to exhibit a hundred pair of gladiators to the people, beside\nan entertainment according to the direction of Arrius; and as much corn\nas is cut in Africa. Whether I have willed this rightly or wrongly, it\nwas my will; be not severe against me, [cries the testator]. I imagine\nthe provident mind of Staberius foresaw this. What then did he moan,\nwhen he appointed by will that his heirs should engrave the sum of their\npatrimony upon his tomb-stone? As long as he lived, he deemed poverty a\ngreat vice, and nothing did he more industriously avoid: insomuch that,\nhad he died less rich by one farthing, the more Iniquitous would he have\nappeared to himself. For every thing, virtue, fame, glory, divine and\nhuman affairs, are subservient to the attraction of riches; which\nwhoever shall have accumulated, shall be illustrious, brave, just–What,\nwise too? Ay, and a king, and whatever else he pleases. This he was in\nhopes would greatly redound to his praise, as if it had been an\nacquisition of his virtue. In what respect did the Grecian Aristippus\nact like this; who ordered his slaves to throw away his gold in the\nmidst of Libya; because, encumbered with the burden, they traveled too\nslowly? Which is the greater madman of these two? An example is nothing\nto the purpose, that decides one controversy by creating another. If any\nperson were to buy lyres, and [when he had bought them] to stow them in\none place; though neither addicted to the lyre nor to any one muse\nwhatsoever: if a man were [to buy] paring-knives and lasts, and were no\nshoemaker; sails fit for navigation, and were averse to merchandizing;\nhe every where deservedly be styled delirious, and out of his senses.\nHow does he differ from these, who boards up cash and gold [and] knows\nnot how to use them when accumulated, and is afraid to touch them as if\nthey were consecrated? If any person before a great heap of corn should\nkeep perpetual watch with a long club, and, though the owner of it, and\nhungry, should not dare to take a single grain from it; and should\nrather feed upon bitter leaves: if while a thousand hogsheads of Chian,\nor old Falernian, is stored up within (nay, that is nothing–three\nhundred thousand), he drink nothing, but what is mere sharp vinegars\nagain–if, wanting but one year of eighty, he should lie upon straw, who\nhas bed-clothes rotting in his chest, the food of worms and moths; he\nwould seem mad, belike, but to few persons: because the greatest part of\nmankind labors, under the same malady.",
        "Thou dotard, hateful to the gods, dost thou guard [these possessions],\nfor fear of wanting thyself: to the end that thy son, or even the\nfreedman thy heir, should guzzle it all up?

You neither did\nthis at Argos, nor slew your mother with the sword, as the mad Orestes\ndid. What, do you imagine that he ran? mad after he had murdered his\nparent; and that he was not driven mad by the wicked Furies, before he\nwarmed his sharp steel in his mother’s throat? Nay, from the time that\nOrestes is deemed to have been of a dangerous disposition, he did\nnothing in fact that you can blame; he did not dare to offer violence\nwith his sword to Pylades, nor to his sister Electra; he only gave ill\nlanguage to both of them, by calling her a Fury, and him some other\n[opprobrious name], which, his violent choler suggested.",

His physician, a man of much dispatch and fidelity,\nraises him in this manner: he orders a table to be brought, and the bags\nof money to be poured out, and several persons to approach in order to\ncount it: by this method he sets the man upon his legs again. And at the\nsame time he addresses him to this effect. Unless you guard your money\nyour ravenous heir will even now carry off these [treasures] of yours.\nWhat, while I am alive?

Why so, Stoic? I will tell you. Such\na patient (suppose Craterus [the physician] said this) is not sick at\nthe heart. Is he therefore well, and shall he get up? No, he will forbid\nthat; because his side or his reins are harassed with an acute disease.\n[In like manner], such a man is not perjured, nor sordid; let him then\nsacrifice a hog to his propitious household gods.

        "Servius Oppidius, rich in the possession of an ancient estate, is\nreported when dying to have divided two farms at Canusium between his\ntwo sons, and to have addressed the boys, called to his bed-side, [in\nthe following manner]: When I saw you, Aulus, carry your playthings and\nnuts carelessly in your bosom, [and] to give them and game them away;\nyou, Tiberius, count them, and anxious hide them in holes; I was afraid\nlest a madness of a different nature should possess you: lest you\n[Aulus], should follow the example of Nomentanus, you, [Tiberius], that\nof Cicuta. Wherefore each of you, entreated by our household gods, do\nyou (Aulus) take care lest you lessen; you (Tiberius) lest you make that\ngreater, which your father thinks and the purposes of nature determine\nto be sufficient. Further, lest glory should entice you, I will bind\neach of you by an oath: whichever of you shall be an aedile or a\npraetor, let him be excommunicated and accursed. Would you destroy your\neffects in [largesses of] peas, beans, and lupines, that you may stalk\nin the circus at large, or stand in a statue of brass, O madman,\nstripped of your paternal estate, stripped of your money?

        "O Agamemnon, why do you prohibit any one from burying Ajax? I am a king.\nI, a plebeian, make no further inquiry. And I command a just thing: but,\nif I seem unjust to any one, I permit you to speak your sentiments with\nimpunity. Greatest of kings, may the gods grant that, after the taking\nof Troy, you may conduct your fleet safe home: may I then have the\nliberty to ask questions, and reply in my turn? Ask. Why does Ajax, the\nsecond hero after Achilles, rot [above ground], so often renowned for\nhaving saved the Grecians; that Priam and Priam’s people may exult in\nhis being unburied, by whose means so many youths have been deprived of\ntheir country’s rites of sepulture. In his madness he killed a thousand\nsheep, crying out that he was destroying the famous Ulysses and\nMenelaus, together with me. When you at Aulis substituted your sweet\ndaughter in the place of a heifer before the altar, and, O impious one,\nsprinkled her head with the salt cake; did you preserve soundness of\nmind? Why do you ask? What then did the mad Ajax do, when he slew the\nflock with his sword? He abstained from any violence to his wife and\nchild, though he had imprecated many curses on the sons of Atreus: he\nneither hurt Teucer, nor even Ulysses himself. But I, out of prudence,\nappeased the gods with blood, that I might loose the ships detained on\nan adverse shore. Yes, madman! with your own blood. With my own\n[indeed], but I was not mad. Whoever shall form images foreign from\nreality, and confused in the tumult of impiety, will always be reckoned\ndisturbed in mind: and it will not matter, whether he go wrong through\nfolly or through rage. Is Ajax delirious, while he kills the harmless\nlambs? Are you right in your head, when you willfully commit a crime for\nempty titles? And is your heart pure, while it is swollen with the vice?\nIf any person should take a delight to carry about with him in his sedan\na pretty lambkin; and should provide clothes, should provide maids and\ngold for it, as for a daughter, should call it Rufa and Rufilla, and\nshould destine it a wife for some stout husband; the praetor would\ntake power from him being interdicted, and the management of him would\ndevolve to his relations, that were in their senses. What, if a man\ndevote his daughter instead of a dumb lambkin, is he right of mind?\nNever say it. Therefore, wherever there is a foolish depravity, there\nwill be the height of madness. He who is wicked, will be frantic too:\nBellona, who delights in bloodshed, has thundered about him, whom\nprecarious fame has captivated.",
        "Now, come on, arraign with me luxury and Nomentanus; for reason will\nevince that foolish spendthrifts are mad. This fellow, as soon as he\nreceived a thousand talents of patrimony, issues an order that the\nfishmonger, the fruiterer, the poulterer, the perfumer, and the impious\ngang of the Tuscan alley, sausage-maker, and buffoons, the whole\nshambles, together with [all] Velabrum, should come to his house in the\nmorning. What was the consequence? They came in crowds. The pander makes\na speech: “Whatever I, or whatever each of these has at home, believe it\nto be yours: and give your order for it either directly, or to-morrow.\"\nHear what reply the considerate youth made: “You sleep booted in\nLucanian snow, that I may feast on a boar: you sweep the wintry seas for\nfish: I am indolent, and unworthy to possess so much. Away with it: do\nyou take for your share ten hundred thousand sesterces; you as much; you\nthrice the sum, from whose house your spouse runs, when called for, at\nmidnight.” The son of Aesopus, [the actor] (that he might, forsooth,\nswallow a million of sesterces at a draught), dissolved in vinegar a\nprecious pearl, which he had taken from the ear of Metella: how much\nwiser was he [in doing this,] than if he had thrown the same into a\nrapid river, or the common sewer? The progeny of Quintius Arrius, an\nillustrious pair of brothers, twins in wickedness and trifling and the\nlove of depravity, used to dine upon nightingales bought at a vast\nexpense: to whom do these belong? Are they in their senses? Are they to\nbe marked With chalk, or with charcoal?",
        "If an [aged person] with a long beard should take a delight to build\nbaby-houses, to yoke mice to a go-cart, to play at odd and even, to ride\nupon a long cane, madness must be his motive. If reason shall evince,\nthat to be in love is a more childish thing than these; and that there\nis no difference whether you play the same games in the dust as when\nthree years old, or whine in anxiety for the love of a harlot: I beg to\nknow, if you will act as the reformed Polemon did of old? Will you lay\naside those ensigns of your disease, your rollers, your mantle, your\nmufflers; as he in his cups is said to have privately torn the chaplet\nfrom his neck, after he was corrected by the speech of his fasting\nmaster? When you offer apples to an angry boy, he refuses them: here,\ntake them, you little dog; he denies you: if you don’t give them, he\nwants them. In what does an excluded lover differ [from such a boy];\nwhen he argues with himself whether he should go or not to that very\nplace whither he was returning without being sent for, and cleaves to\nthe hated doors? “What shall I not go to her now, when she invites me of\nher own accord? or shall I rather think of putting an end to my pains?\nShe has excluded me; she recalls me: shall I return? No, not if she\nwould implore me.” Observe the servant, not a little wiser: “O master,\nthat which has neither moderation nor conduct, can not be guided by\nreason or method. In love these evils are inherent; war [one while],\nthen peace again. If any one should endeavor to ascertain these things,\nthat are various as the weather, and fluctuating by blind chance; he\nwill make no more of it, than if he should set about raving by right\nreason and rule.” What–when, picking the pippins from the Picenian\napples, you rejoice if haply you have hit the vaulted roof; are you\nyourself? What–when you strike out faltering accents from your\nantiquated palate, how much wiser are you than [a child] that builds\nlittle houses? To the folly [of love] add bloodshed, and stir the fire\nwith a sword. I ask you, when Marius lately, after he had stabbed\nHellas, threw himself down a precipice, was he raving mad? Or will you\nabsolve the man from the imputation of a disturbed mind, and condemn him\nfor the crime, according to your custom, imposing, on things named that\nhave an affinity in signification?",

What–is it fitting that, in every thing\nMaecenas does, you, who are so very much unlike him and so much his\ninferior, should vie with him? The young ones of a frog being in her\nabsence crushed by the foot of a calf, when one of them had made his\nescape, he told his mother what a huge beast had dashed his brethren to\npieces. She began to ask, how big? Whether it were so great? puffing\nherself up. Greater by half. What, so big? when she had swelled herself\nmore and more. If you should burst yourself, says he, you will not be\nequal to it. This image bears no great dissimilitude to you.

Nay, but I was anxious, how I might retain all [these\nprecepts]; as being things of a delicate nature, and in a delicate\nstyle. Tell me the name of this man; and at the same time whether he is\na Roman, or a foreigner? As I have them by heart, I will recite the\nprecepts: the author shall be concealed.",
        "Remember to serve up those eggs that are of an oblong make, as being of\nsweeter flavor and more nutritive than the round ones: for, being\ntough-shelled, they contain a male yelk. Cabbage that grows in dry\nlands, is sweeter than that about town: nothing is more insipid than a\ngarden much watered. If a visitor should come unexpectedly upon you in\nthe evening, lest the tough old hen prove disagreeable to his palate,\nyou must learn to drown it in Falernian wine mixed [with water]: this\nwill make it tender. The mushrooms that grow in meadows, are of the best\nkind: all others are dangerously trusted. That man shall spend his\nsummers healthy who shall finish his dinners with mulberries black [with\nripeness], which he shall have gathered from the tree before the sun\nbecomes violent. Aufidius used to mix honey with strong Falernian\ninjudiciously; because it is right to commit nothing to the empty veins,\nbut what is emollient: you will, with more propriety, wash your stomach\nwith soft mead. If your belly should be hard bound, the limpet and\ncoarse cockles will remove obstructions, and leaves of the small sorrel;\nbut not without Coan white wine. The increasing moons swell the\nlubricating shell-fish. But every sea is not productive of the exquisite\nsorts. The Lucrine muscle is better than the Baian murex: [The best]\noysters come from the Circaean promontory; cray-fish from Misenum: the\nsoft Tarentum plumes herself on her broad escalops. Let no one\npresumptuously arrogate to himself the science of banqueting, unless the\nnice doctrine of tastes has been previously considered by him with exact\nsystem. Nor is it enough to sweep away a parcel of fishes from the\nexpensive stalls, [while he remains] ignorant for what sort stewed sauce\nis more proper, and what being roasted, the sated guest will presently\nreplace himself on his elbow. Let the boar from Umbria, and that which\nhas been fed with the acorns of the scarlet oak, bend the round dishes\nof him who dislikes all flabby meat: for the Laurentian boar, fattened\nwith flags and reeds, is bad. The vineyard does not always afford the\nmost eatable kids. A man of sense will be fond of the shoulders of a\npregnant hare. What is the proper age and nature of fish and fowl,\nthough inquired after, was never discovered before my palate. There are\nsome, whose genius invents nothing but new kinds of pastry. To waste\none’s care upon one thing, is by no means sufficient; just as if any\nperson should use all his endeavors for this only, that the wine be not\nbad; quite careless what oil he pours upon his fish. If you set out\nMassic wine in fair weather, should there be any thing thick in it, it\nwill be attenuated by the nocturnal air, and the smell unfriendly to the\nnerves will go off: but, if filtrated through linen, it will lose its\nentire flavor. He, who skillfully mixes the Surrentine wine with\nFalernian lees, collects the sediment with a pigeon’s egg: because the\nyelk sinks to the bottom, rolling down with it all the heterogeneous\nparts. You may rouse the jaded toper with roasted shrimps and African\ncockles; for lettuce after wine floats upon the soured stomach: by ham\npreferably, and by sausages, it craves to be restored to its appetite:\nnay, it will prefer every thing which is brought smoking hot from the\nnasty eating-houses. It is worth while to be acquainted with the two\nkinds of sauce. The simple consists of sweet oil; which it will be\nproper to mix with rich wine and pickle, but with no other pickle than\nthat by which the Byzantine jar has been tainted. When this, mingled\nwith shredded herbs, has boiled, and sprinkled with Corycian saffron,\nhas stood, you shall over and above add what the pressed berry of the\nVenafran olive yields. The Tiburtian yield to the Picenian apples in\njuice, though they excel in look. The Venusian grape is proper for\n[preserving in] pots. The Albanian you had better harden in the smoke. I\nam found to be the first that served up this grape with apples in neat\nlittle side-plates, to be the first [likewise that served up] wine-lees\nand herring-brine, and white pepper finely mixed with black salt. It is\nan enormous fault to bestow three thousand sesterces on the fish-market,\nand then to cramp the roving fishes in a narrow dish. It causes a great\nnausea in the stomach, if even the slave touches the cup with greasy\nhands, while he licks up snacks, or if offensive grime has adhered to\nthe ancient goblet. In trays, in mats, in sawdust, [that are so] cheap,\nwhat great expense can there be? But, if they are neglected, it is a\nheinous shame. What, should you sweep Mosaic pavements with a dirty\nbroom made of palm, and throw Tyrian carpets over the unwashed furniture\nof your couch! forgetting, that by how much less care and expense these\nthings are attended, so much the more justly may [the want of them] be\ncensured, than of those things which can not be obtained but at the\ntables of the rich?",

Use your craft to lie at catch for the last wills of old\nmen: nor, if one or two cunning chaps escape by biting the bait off the\nhook, either lay aside hope, or quit the art, though disappointed in\nyour aim. If an affair, either of little or great consequence, shall be\ncontested at any time at the bar; whichever of the parties live wealthy\nwithout heirs, should he be a rogue, who daringly takes the law of a\nbetter man, be thou his advocate: despise the citizen, who is superior\nin reputation, and [the justness of] his cause, if at home he has a son\nor a fruitful wife.

Attack him with complaisance: if the air freshens, advise him\ncarefully to cover up his precious head: disengage him from the crowd by\nopposing your shoulders to it: closely attach your ear to him if chatty.\nIs he immoderately fond of being praised? Pay him home, till he shall\ncry out, with his hands lifted up to heaven, “Enough:” and puff up the\nswelling bladder with tumid speeches. When he shall have [at last]\nreleased you from your long servitude and anxiety; and being certainly\nawake, you shall hear [this article in his will]? “Let Ulysses be heir\nto one fourth of my estate:” “is then my companion Damas now no more?\nwhere shall I find one so brave and so faithful?” Throw out [something\nof this kind] every now and then: and if you can a little, weep for him.\nIt is fit to disguise your countenance, which [otherwise] would betray\nyour joy. As for the monument, which is left to your own discretion,\nerect it without meanness. The neighborhood will commend the funeral\nhandsomely performed. If haply any of your co-heirs, being advanced in\nyears, should have a dangerous cough; whether he has a mind to be a\npurchaser of a farm or a house out of your share, tell him, you will\n[come to any terms he shall propose, and] make it over to him gladly for\na trifling sum.

At Rome you hurry me away to be bail; “Away,\ndispatch, [you cry,] lest any one should be beforehand with you in doing\nthat friendly office:” I must go, at all events, whether the north wind\nsweep the earth, or winter contracts the snowy day into a narrower\ncircle. After this, having uttered in a clear and determinate manner\n[the legal form], which may be a detriment to me, I must bustle through\nthe crowd; and must disoblige the tardy. “What is your will, madman, and\nwhat are you about, impudent fellow?” So one accosts me with his\npassionate curses. “You jostle every thing that is in your way, if with\nan appointment full in your mind you are away to Maecenas.” This pleases\nme, and is like honey: I will not tell a lie. But by the time I reached\nthe gloomy Esquiliae, a hundred affairs of other people’s encompass me\non every side: “Roscius begged that you would be with him at the\ncourt-house to-morrow before the second hour.” “The secretaries\nrequested you would remember, Quintus, to return to-day about an affair\nof public concern, and of great consequence.” “Get Maecenas to put his\nsignet to these tablets.” Should one say, “I will endeavor at it:” “If\nyou will, you can,” adds he; and is more earnest. The seventh year\napproaching to the eighth is now elapsed, from the time that Maecenas\nbegan to reckon me in the number of his friends; only thus far, as one\nhe would like to take along with him in his chariot, when he went a\njourney, and to whom he would trust such kind of trifles as these: “What\nis the hour?” “Is Gallina, the Thracian, a match for [the gladiator]\nSyrus?” “The cold morning air begins to pinch those that are ill\nprovided against it;\"–and such things-as are well enough intrusted to a\nleaky ear. For all this time, every day and hour, I have been more\nsubjected to envy. “Our son of fortune here, says every body, witnessed\nthe shows in company with [Maecenas], and played with him in the Campus\nMartius.” Does any disheartening report spread from the rostrum through\nthe streets, whoever comes in my way consults me [concerning it]: “Good\nsir, have you (for you must know, since you approach nearer the gods)\nheard any thing relating to the Dacians?” “Nothing at all for my part,\"\n[I reply]. “How you ever are a sneerer!” “But may all the gods torture\nme, if I know any thing of the matter.” “What? will Caesar give the\nlands he promised the soldiers, in Sicily, or in Italy?” As I am\nswearing I know nothing about it, they wonder at me, [thinking] me, to\nbe sure, a creature of profound and extraordinary secrecy.",
        "Among things of this nature the day is wasted by me, mortified as I am,\nnot without such wishes as these: O rural retirement, when shall I\nbehold thee? and when shall it be in my power to pass through the\npleasing oblivion of a life full of solicitude, one while with the books\nof the ancients, another while in sleep and leisure? O when shall the\nbean related to Pythagoras, and at the same time herbs well larded with\nfat bacon, be set before me? O evenings, and suppers fit for gods! with\nwhich I and my friends regale ourselves in the presence of my household\ngods; and feed my saucy slaves with viands, of which libations have been\nmade. The guest, according to every one’s inclination, takes off the\nglasses of different sizes, free from mad laws: whether one of a strong\nconstitution chooses hearty bumpers; or another more joyously gets\nmellow with moderate ones.

Meanwhile, my neighbor\nCervius prates away old stories relative to the subject. For, if any one\nignorantly commends the troublesome riches of Aurelius, he thus begins:\n\"On a time a country-mouse is reported to have received a city-mouse\ninto his poor cave, an old host, his old acquaintance; a blunt fellow\nand attentive to his acquisitions, yet so as he could [on occasion]\nenlarge his narrow soul in acts of hospitality. What need of many words?\nHe neither grudged him the hoarded vetches, nor the long oats; and\nbringing in his mouth a dry plum, and nibbled scraps of bacon, presented\nthem to him, being desirous by the variety of the supper to get the\nbetter of the daintiness of his guest, who hardly touched with his\ndelicate tooth the several things: while the father of the family\nhimself, extended on fresh straw, ate a spelt and darnel leaving that\nwhich was better [for his guest]. At length the citizen addressing him,\n’Friend,’ says he, ’what delight have you to live laboriously on the\nridge of a rugged thicket? Will you not prefer men and the city to the\nsavage woods? Take my advice, and go along with me: since mortal lives\nare allotted to all terrestrial animals, nor is there any escape from\ndeath, either for the great or the small. Wherefore, my good friend,\nwhile it is in your power, live happy in joyous circumstances: live\nmindful of how brief an existence you are.’ Soon as these speeches had\nwrought upon the peasant, he leaps nimbly from his cave: thence they\nboth pursue their intended journey, being desirous to steal under the\ncity walls by night. And now the night possessed the middle region of\nthe heavens, when each of them set foot in a gorgeous palace, where\ncarpets dyed with crimson grain glittered upon ivory couches, and many\nbaskets of a magnificent entertainment remained, which had yesterday\nbeen set by in baskets piled upon one another. After he had placed the\npeasant then, stretched at ease upon a splendid carpet; he bustles about\nlike an adroit host, and keeps bringing up one dish close upon another,\nand with an affected civility performs all the ceremonies, first tasting\nof every thing he serves up. He, reclined, rejoices in the change of his\nsituation, and acts the part of a boon companion in the good cheer: when\non a sudden a prodigious rattling of the folding doors shook them both\nfrom their couches. Terrified they began to scamper all about the room,\nand more and more heartless to be in confusion, while the lofty house\nresounded with [the barking of] mastiff dogs; upon which, says the\ncountry-mouse, ’I have no desire for a life like this; and so farewell:\nmy wood and cave, secure from surprises, shall with homely tares comfort\nme.’”",

After\nthis he informed me that honey-apples were most ruddy when gathered\nunder the waning moon. What difference this makes you will hear best\nfrom himself. Then [says] Vibidius to Balatro; “If we do not drink to\nhis cost, we shall die in his debt;” and he calls for larger tumblers.

My age is not the same,\nnor is my genius. Veianius, his arms consecrated on a pillar of\nHercules’ temple, lives snugly retired in the country, that he may not\nfrom the extremity of the sandy amphitheater so often supplicate the\npeople’s favor. Some one seems frequently to ring in my purified ear:\n\"Wisely in time dismiss the aged courser, lest, an object of derision,\nhe miscarry at last, and break his wind.” Now therefore I lay aside both\nverses, and all other sportive matters; my study and inquiry is after\nwhat is true and fitting, and I am wholly engaged in this: I lay up, and\ncollect rules which I may be able hereafter to bring into use. And lest\nyou should perchance ask under what leader, in what house [of\nphilosophy], I enter myself a pupil: addicted to swear implicitly to the\nipse-dixits of no particular master, wherever the weather drives me, I\nam carried a guest. One while I become active, and am plunged in the\nwaves of state affairs, a maintainer and a rigid partisan of strict\nvirtue; then again I relapse insensibly into Aristippus’ maxims, and\nendeavor to adapt circumstances to myself, not myself to circumstances.\nAs the night seems long to those with whom a mistress has broken her\nappointment, and the day slow to those who owe their labor; as the year\nmoves lazy with minors, whom the harsh guardianship of their mothers\nconfines; so all that time to me flows tedious and distasteful, which\ndelays my hope and design of strenuously executing that which is of\nequal benefit to the poor and to the rich, which neglected will be of\nequal detriment to young and to old. It remains, that I conduct and\ncomfort myself by these principles; your sight is not so piercing as\nthat of Lynceus; you will not however therefore despise being anointed,\nif you are sore-eyed: nor because you despair of the muscles of the\ninvincible Glycon, will you be careless of preserving your body from the\nknotty gout. There is some point to which we may reach, if we can go no\nfurther. Does your heart burn with avarice, and a wretched desire of\nmore? Spells there are, and incantations, with which you may mitigate\nthis pain, and rid yourself of a great part of the distemper. Do you\nswell with the love of praise? There are certain purgations which can\nrestore you, a certain treatise, being perused thrice with purity of\nmind.

And will you\nnot learn, and hear, and be advised by one who is wiser, that you may no\nlonger regard those things which you foolishly admire and wish for? What\nlittle champion of the villages and of the streets would scorn being\ncrowned at the great Olympic games, who had the hopes and happy\nopportunity of victory without toil? Silver is less valuable than gold,\ngold than virtue. “O citizens, citizens, money is to be sought first;\nvirtue after riches:” this the highest Janus from the lowest inculcates;\nyoung men and old repeat these maxims, having their bags and\naccount-books hung on the left arm.

Tell me, pray is the Roscian law best, or the boy’s song which\noffers the kingdom to them that do right, sung by the manly Curii and\nCamilli? Does he advise you best, who says, “Make a fortune; a fortune,\nif you can, honestly; if not, a fortune by any means\"–that you may view\nfrom a nearer bench the tear-moving poems of Puppius; or he, who still\nanimates and enables you to stand free and upright, a match for haughty\nfortune?",
        "If now perchance the Roman people should ask me, why I do not enjoy the\nsame sentiments with them, as [I do the same] porticoes, nor pursue or\nfly from whatever they admire or dislike; I will reply, as the cautious\nfox once answered the sick lion: “Because the foot-marks all looking\ntoward you, and none from you, affright me.” Thou art a monster with\nmany heads. For what shall I follow, or whom? One set of men delight to\nfarm the public revenues: there are some, who would inveigle covetous\nwidows with sweet-meats and fruits, and insnare old men, whom they would\nsend [like fish] into their ponds: the fortunes of many grow by\nconcealed usury. But be it, that different men are engaged in different\nemployments and pursuits: can the same persons continue an hour together\napproving the same things? If the man of wealth has said, “No bay in the\nworld outshines delightful Baiae,” the lake and the sea presently feel\nthe eagerness of their impetuous master: to whom, if a vicious humor\ngives the omen, [he will cry,]–\"to-morrow, workmen, ye shall convey\nhence your tools to Teanum.” Has he in his hall the genial bed? He says\nnothing is preferable to, nothing better than a single life. If he has\nnot, he swears the married only are happy. With what noose can I hold\nthis Proteus, varying thus his forms? What does the poor man? Laugh [at\nhim too]: is he not forever changing his garrets, beds, baths, barbers?\nHe is as much surfeited in a hired boat, as the rich man is, whom his\nown galley conveys.",
        "If I meet you with my hair cut by an uneven barber, you laugh [at me]:\nif I chance to have a ragged shirt under a handsome coat, or if my\ndisproportioned gown fits me ill, you laugh. What [do you do], when my\njudgment contradicts itself? it despises what it before desired; seeks\nfor that which lately it neglected; is all in a ferment, and is\ninconsistent in the whole tenor of life; pulls down, builds up, changes\nsquare to round. In this case, you think I am mad in the common way, and\nyou do not laugh, nor believe that I stand in need of a physician, or\nof a guardian assigned by the praetor; though you are the patron of my\naffairs, and are disgusted at the ill-pared nail of a friend that\ndepends upon you, that reveres you.",

        "TO LOLLIUS.",
        "He prefers Homer to all the philosophers, as a moral writer, and\nadvises an early cultivation of virtue.",
        "While you, great Lollius, declaim at Rome, I at Praeneste have perused\nover again the writer of the Trojan war; who teaches more clearly, and\nbetter than Chrysippus and Crantor, what is honorable, what shameful,\nwhat profitable, what not so. If nothing hinders you, hear why I have\nthus concluded. The story is which, on account of Paris’s intrigue,\nGreece is stated to be wasted in a tedious war with the barbarians,\ncontains the tumults of foolish princes and people. Antenor gives his\nopinion for cutting off the cause of the war. What does Paris? He can\nnot be brought to comply, [though it be in order] that he may reign\nsafe, and live happy. Nestor labors to compose the differences between\nAchilles and Agamemnon: love inflames one; rage both in common. The\nGreeks suffer for what their princes act foolishly. Within the walls of\nIlium, and without, enormities are committed by sedition, treachery,\ninjustice, and lust, and rage.",
        "Again, to show what virtue and what wisdom can do, he has propounded\nUlysses an instructive pattern: who, having subdued Troy, wisely got an\ninsight into the constitutions and customs of many nations; and, while\nfor himself and his associates he is contriving a return, endured many\nhardships on the spacious sea, not to be sunk by all the waves of\nadversity. You are well acquainted with the songs of the Sirens, and\nCirce’s cups: of which, if he had foolishly and greedily drunk along\nwith his attendants, he had been an ignominious and senseless slave\nunder the command of a prostitute: he had lived a filthy dog, or a hog\ndelighting in mire.",
        "We are a mere number and born to consume the fruits of the earth; like\nPenelope’s suitors, useless drones; like Alcinous’ youth, employed above\nmeasure in pampering their bodies; whose glory was to sleep till\nmid-day, and to lull their cares to rest by the sound of the harp.\nRobbers rise by night, that they may cut men’s throats; and will not you\nawake to save yourself? But, if you will not when you are in health, you\nwill be forced to take exercise when you are in a dropsy; and unless\nbefore day you call for a book with a light, unless you brace your mind\nwith study and honest employments, you will be kept awake and tormented\nwith envy or with love. For why do you hasten to remove things that hurt\nyour eyes, but if any thing gnaws your mind, defer the time of curing it\nfrom year to year? He has half the deed done, who has made a beginning.\nBoldly undertake the study of true wisdom: begin it forthwith. He who\npostpones the hour of living well, like the hind [in the fable], waits\ntill [all the water in] the river be run off: whereas it flows, and will\nflow, ever rolling on.",
        "Money is sought, and a wife fruitful in bearing children, and wild\nwoodlands are reclaimed by the plow. [To what end all this?] He, that\nhas got a competency, let him wish for no more. Not a house and farm,\nnor a heap of brass and gold, can remove fevers from the body of their\nsick master, or cares from his mind. The possessor must be well, if he\nthinks of enjoying the things which he has accumulated. To him that is a\nslave to desire or to fear, house and estate do just as much good as\npaintings to a sore-eyed person, fomentations to the gout, music to ears\nafflicted with collected matter. Unless the vessel be sweet, whatever\nyou pour into it turns sour. Despise pleasures, pleasure bought with\npain is hurtful. The covetous man is ever in want; set a certain limit\nto your wishes. The envious person wastes at the thriving condition of\nanother: Sicilian tyrants never invented a greater torment than envy. He\nwho will not curb his passion, will wish that undone which his grief and\nresentment suggested, while he violently plies his revenge with unsated\nrancor. Rage is a short madness. Rule your passion, which commands, if\nit do not obey; do you restrain it with a bridle, and with fetters. The\ngroom forms the docile horse, while his neck is yet tender, to go the\nway which his rider directs him: the young hound, from the time that he\nbarked at the deer’s skin in the hall, campaigns it in the woods. Now,\nwhile you are young, with an untainted mind Imbibe instruction: now\napply yourself to the best [masters of morality]. A cask will long\npreserve the flavor, with which when new it was once impregnated.

        "I long to know, Julius Florus, in what regions of the earth Claudius,\nthe step-son of Augustus, is waging war. Do Thrace and Hebrus, bound\nwith icy chains, or the narrow sea running between the neighboring\ntowers, or Asia’s fertile plains and hills detain you? What works is the\nstudious train planning? In this too I am anxious–who takes upon\nhimself to write the military achievements of Augustus? Who diffuses\ninto distant ages his deeds in war and peace? What is Titius about, who\nshortly will be celebrated by every Roman tongue; who dreaded not to\ndrink of the Pindaric spring, daring to disdain common waters and open\nstreams: how does he do? How mindful is he of me? Does he employ himself\nto adapt Theban measures to the Latin lyre, under the direction of his\nmuse? Or does he storm and swell in the pompous style of traffic art?\nWhat is my Celsus doing? He has been advised, and the advice is still\noften to be repeated, to acquire stock of his own, and forbear to touch\nwhatever writings the Palatine Apollo has received: lest, if it chance\nthat the flock of birds should some time or other come to demand their\nfeathers, he, like the daw stripped of his stolen colors, be exposed to\nridicule. What do you yourself undertake? What thyme are you busy\nhovering about? Your genius is not small, is not uncultivated nor\ninelegantly rough. Whether you edge your tongue for [pleading] causes,\nor whether you prepare to give counsel in the civil law, or whether you\ncompose some lovely poem; you will bear off the first prize of the\nvictorious ivy. If now you could quit the cold fomentations of care;\nwhithersoever heavenly wisdom would lead you, you would go. Let us,\nboth small and great, push forward in this work, in this pursuit: if to\nour country, if to ourselves we would live dear.",
        "You must also write me word of this, whether Munatiua is of as much\nconcern to you as he ought to be? Or whether the ill-patched\nreconciliation in vain closes, and is rent asunder again?

Writing what may excel the works\nof Cassius Parmensis; or sauntering silently among the healthful groves,\nconcerning yourself about every thing worthy a wise and good man? You\nwere not a body without a mind. The gods have given you a beautiful\nform, the gods [have given] you wealth, and the faculty of enjoying it.",

        "If you can repose yourself as my guest upon Archias’ couches, and are\nnot afraid to make a whole meal on all sorts of herbs from a moderate\ndish; I will expect you, Torquatus, at my house about sun set. You shall\ndrink wine poured into the vessel in the second consulship of Taurus,\nproduced between the fenny Minturnae and Petrinum of Sinuessa. If you\nhave any thing better, send for it; or bring your commands. Bright\nshines my hearth, and my furniture is clean for you already. Dismiss\nairy hopes, and contests about riches, and Moschus’ cause. To-morrow, a\nfestal day on account of Caesar’s birth, admits of indulgence and\nrepose. We shall have free liberty to prolong the summer evening with\nfriendly conversation. To what purpose have I fortune, if I may not use\nit? He that is sparing out of regard to his heir, and too niggardly, is\nnext neighbor to a madman. I will begin to drink and scatter flowers,\nand I will endure even to be accounted foolish. What does not wine\nfreely drunken enterprise? It discloses secrets; commands our hopes to\nbe ratified; pushes the dastard on to the fight; removes the pressure\nfrom troubled minds; teaches the arts. Whom have not plentiful cups made\neloquent? Whom have they not [made] free and easy under pinching\npoverty?",
        "I, who am both the proper person and not unwilling, am charged to take\ncare of these matters; that no dirty covering on the couch, no foul\nnapkin contract your nose into wrinkles; and that the cup and the dish\nmay show you to yourself; that there be no one to carry abroad what is\nsaid among faithful friends; that equals may meet and be joined with\nequals I will add to you Butra, and Septicius, and Sabinus, unless a\nbetter entertainment and a mistress more agreeable detain him. There is\nroom also for many introductions: but goaty ramminess is offensive in\nover-crowded companies.",

There are who view this sun, and the stars,\nand the seasons retiring at certain periods, untainted with any fear.\nWhat do you think of the gifts of the earth? What of the sea, that\nenriches the remote Arabians and Indians? What of scenical shows, the\napplause and favors of the kind Roman? In what manner do you think they\nare to be looked upon, with what apprehensions and countenance? He that\ndreads the reverse of these, admires them almost in the same way as he\nthat desires them; fear alike disturbs both ways: an unforeseen turn of\nthings equally terrifies each of them: let a man rejoice or grieve,\ndesire or fear; what matters it–if, whatever he perceives better or\nworse than his expectations, with downcast look he be stupefied in mind\nand body? Let the wise man bear the name of fool, the just of unjust; if\nhe pursue virtue itself beyond proper bounds.",
        "Go now, look with transport upon silver, and antique marble, and brazen\nstatues, and the arts: admire gems, and Tyrian dyes: rejoice, that a\nthousand eyes are fixed upon you while you speak: industrious repair\nearly to the forum, late to your house, that Mutus may not reap more\ngrain [than you] from his lands gained in dowry, and (unbecoming, since\nhe sprung from meaner parents) that he may not be an object of\nadmiration to you rather than you to him. Whatever is in the earth, time\nwill bring forth into open day light; will bury and hide things, that\nnow shine brightest. When Agrippa’s portico, and the Appian way, shall\nhave beheld you well known; still it remains for you to go where Numa\nand Ancus are arrived. If your side or your reins are afflicted with an\nacute disease, seek a remedy from the disease. Would you live happily?\nWho would not? If virtue alone can confer this, discarding pleasures,\nstrenuously pursue it. Do you think virtue mere words, as a grove is\ntrees? Be it your care that no other enter the port before you; that you\nlose not your traffic with Cibyra, with Bithynia. Let the round sum of a\nthousand talents be completed; as many more; further, let a third\nthousand succeed, and the part which may square the heap. For why,\nsovereign money gives a wife with a [large] portion, and credit, and\nfriends, and family, and beauty; and [the goddesses], Persuasion and\nVenus, graced the well-moneyed man. The king of the Cappadocians, rich\nin slaves, is in want of coin; be not you like him. Lucullus, as they\nsay, being asked if he could lend a hundred cloaks for the stage, “How\ncan I so many?” said he: “yet I will see, and send as many as I have;” a\nlittle after he writes that he had five thousand cloaks in his house;\nthey might take part of them, or all. It is a scanty house, where there\nare not many things superfluous, and which escape the owner’s notice,\nand are the gain of pilfering slaves. If then wealth alone can make and\nkeep a man happy, be first in beginning this work, be last in leaving it\noff. If appearances and popularity make a man fortunate, let as purchase\na slave to dictate [to us] the names [of the citizens], to jog us on the\nleft-side, and to make us stretch our hand over obstacles: “This man has\nmuch interest in the Fabian, that in the Veline tribe; this will give\nthe fasces to any one, and, indefatigably active, snatch the curule\nivory from whom he pleases; add [the names of] father, brother:\naccording as the age of each is, so courteously adopt him. If he who\nfeasts well, lives well; it is day, let us go whither our appetite leads\nus: let us fish, let us hunt, as did some time Gargilius: who ordered\nhis toils, hunting-spears, slaves, early in the morning to pass through\nthe crowded forum and the people: that one mule among many, in the sight\nof the people, might return loaded with a boar purchased with money. Let\nus bathe with an indigested and full-swollen stomach, forgetting what is\nbecoming, what not; deserving to be enrolled among the citizens of\nCaere; like the depraved crew of Ulysses of Ithaca, to whom forbidden\npleasure was dearer than their country.

But, if the winter shall scatter snow upon the Alban fields, your\npoet will go down to the seaside, and be careful of himself, and read\nbundled up; you, dear friend, he will revisit with the zephyrs, if you\nwill give him leave, and with the first swallow.",

A good and wise man professes himself ready to do\nkindness to the deserving; and yet is not ignorant, how true coins\ndiffer from lupines. I will also show myself deserving of the honor of\nbeing grateful. But if you would not have me depart any whither, you\nmust restore my vigorous constitution, the black locks [that grew] on my\nnarrow forehead: you must restore to me the power of talking pleasantly:\nyou must restore to me the art of laughing with becoming ease, and\nwhining over my liquor at the jilting of the wanton Cynara.",

You have often commended me for being modest; when present\nyou heard [from me the appellations of] king and father, nor am I a word\nmore sparing in your absence. Try whether I can cheerfully restore what\nyou have given me. Not amiss [answered] Telemachus, son of the patient\nUlysses: “The country of Ithaca is not proper for horses, as being\nneither extended into champaign fields, nor abounding with much grass:\nAtrides, I will leave behind me your gifts, [which are] more proper for\nyourself.” Small things best suit the small.

        "“I would inquire of him himself all this, which you report; bid him come\nto sup with me.” Maena can not believe it; he wonders silently within\nhimself. Why many words? He answers, “It is kind.” “Can he deny me?\"\n\"The rascal denies, and disregards or dreads you.” In the morning Philip\ncomes unawares upon Vulteius, as he is selling brokery-goods to the\ntunic’d populace, and salutes him first.

When he had often been seen, to\nrepair like a fish to the concealed hook, in the morning a client, and\nnow as a constant guest; he is desired to accompany [Philip] to his\ncountry-seat near the city, at the proclaiming of the Latin festivals.\nMounted on horseback, he ceases not to cry up the Sabine fields and air.\nPhilip sees it, and smiles: and, while he is seeking amusement and\ndiversion for himself out of every thing, while he makes him a present\nof seven thousand sesterces, and promises to lend him seven thousand\nmore: he persuades him to purchase a farm: he purchases one. That I may\nnot detain you with a long story beyond what is necessary, from a smart\ncit he becomes a downright rustic, and prates of nothing but furrows and\nvineyards; prepares his elms; is ready to die with eager diligence, and\ngrows old through a passionate desire of possessing. But when his sheep\nwere lost by theft, his goats by distemper, his harvest deceived his\nhopes, his ox was killed with plowing; fretted with these losses, at\nmidnight he snatches his nag, and in a passion makes his way to Philip’s\nhouse. Whom as soon as Philip beheld, rough and unshaven, “Vulteius,\"\nsaid he, “you seem to me to be too laborious and earnest.” “In truth,\npatron,” replied he, “you would call me a wretch, if you would apply to\nme my true name. I beseech and conjure you then, by your genius and your\nright hand and your household gods, restore me to my former life.” As\nsoon as a man perceives, how much the things he has discarded excel\nthose which he pursues, let him return in time, and resume those which\nhe relinquished.",

        "The stag, superior in fight, drove the horse from the common pasture,\ntill the latter, worsted in the long contest, implored the aid of man\nand received the bridle; but after he had parted an exulting conqueror\nfrom his enemy, he could not shake the rider from his back, nor the bit\nfrom his mouth. So he who, afraid of poverty, forfeits his liberty, more\nvaluable than mines, avaricious wretch, shall carry a master, and shall\neternally be a slave, for not knowing how to use a little. When a man’s\ncondition does not suit him, it will be as a shoe at any time; which, if\ntoo big for his foot, will throw him down; if too little, will pinch\nhim. [If you are] cheerful under your lot, Aristius, you will live\nwisely; nor shall you let me go uncorrected, if I appear to scrape\ntogether more than enough and not have done. Accumulated money is the\nmaster or slave of each owner, and ought rather to follow than to lead\nthe twisted rope.",

        "What, Bullatius, do you think of Chios, and of celebrated Lesbos? What\nof neat Samos? What of Sardis, the royal residence of Croesus? What of\nSmyrna, and Colophon? Are they greater or less than their fame? Are they\nall contemptible in comparison of the Campus Martius and the river\nTiber? Does one of Attalus’ cities enter into your wish? Or do you\nadmire Lebedus, through a surfeit of the sea and of traveling? You know\nwhat Lebedus is; it is a more unfrequented town than Gabii and Fidenae;\nyet there would I be willing to live; and, forgetful of my friends and\nforgotten by them, view from land Neptune raging at a distance. But\nneither he who comes to Rome from Capua, bespattered with rain and mire,\nwould wish to live in an inn; nor does he, who has contracted a cold,\ncry up stoves and bagnios as completely furnishing a happy life: nor, if\nthe violent south wind has tossed you in the deep, will you therefore\nsell your ship on the other side of the Aegean Sea. On a man sound in\nmind Rhodes and beautiful Mitylene have such an effect, as a thick cloak\nat the summer solstice, thin drawers in snowy weather, [bathing in] the\nTiber in winter, a fire in the month of August. While it is permitted,\nand fortune preserves a benign aspect, let absent Samos, and Chios, and\nRhodes, be commended by you here at Rome. Whatever prosperous; hour\nProvidence bestows upon you, receive it with a thankful hand: and defer\nnot [the enjoyment of] the comforts of life, till a year be at an end;\nthat in whatever place you are, you may say you have lived with\nsatisfaction. For if reason and discretion, not a place that commands a\nprospect of the wide-extended sea, remove our cares; they change their\nclimate, not their disposition, who run beyond the sea: a busy idleness\nharrasses us: by ships and by chariots we seek to live happily.

        "O Iccius, if you rightly enjoy the Sicilian products, which you collect\nfor Agrippa, it is not possible that greater affluence can be given you\nby Jove. Away with complaints! for that man is by no means poor, who has\nthe use or everything, he wants. If it is well with your belly, your\nback, and your feet, regal wealth can add nothing greater. If perchance\nabstemious amid profusion you live upon salad and shell-fish, you will\ncontinue to live in such a manner, even if presently fortune shall flow\nupon you in a river of gold; either because money can not change the\nnatural disposition, or because it is your opinion that all things are\ninferior to virtue alone. Can we wonder that cattle feed upon the\nmeadows and corn-fields of Democritus, while his active soul is abroad\n[traveling] without his body? When you, amid such great impurity and\ninfection of profit, have no taste for any thing trivial, but still mind\n[only] sublime things: what causes restrain the sea, what rules the\nyear, whether the stars spontaneously or by direction wander about and\nare erratic, what throws obscurity on the moon, and what brings out her\norb, what is the intention and power of the jarring harmony of things,\nwhether Empedocles or the clever Stertinius be in the wrong.",
        "However, whether you murder fishes, or onions and garlic, receive\nPompeius Grosphus; and, if he asks any favor, grant it him frankly:\nGrosphus will desire nothing but what is right and just. The proceeds of\nfriendship are cheap, when good men want any thing.",
        "But that you may not be ignorant in what situation the Roman affairs\nare; the Cantabrians have fallen by the valor of Agrippa, the Armenians\nby that of Claudius Nero: Phraates has, suppliant on his knees, admitted\nthe laws and power of Caesar.

If haply the\nheavy load of my paper should gall you, cast it from you, rather than\nthrow down your pack in a rough manner where you are directed to carry\nit, and turn your paternal name of Asina into a jest, and make yourself\na common story.

        "Though my affection and solicitude for Lamia, mourning for his brother,\nlamenting inconsolably for his brother’s loss, detain me; nevertheless\nmy heart and soul carry me thither and long to break through those\nbarriers that obstruct my way. I pronounce him the happy man who dwells\nin the country, you him [who lives] in the city. He to whom his\nneighbor’s lot is agreeable, must of consequence dislike his own. Each\nof us is a fool for unjustly blaming the innocent place. The mind is in\nfault, which never escapes from itself. When you were a drudge at every\none’s beck, you tacitly prayed for the country: and now, [being\nappointed] my steward, you wish for the city, the shows, and the baths.\nYou know I am consistent with myself, and loth to go, whenever\ndisagreeable business drags me to Rome. We are not admirers of the same\nthings: henoe you and I disagree. For what you reckon desert and\ninhospitable wilds, he who is of my way of thinking calls delightful\nplaces; and dislikes what you esteem pleasant. The bagnio, I perceive,\nand the greasy tavern raise your inclination for the city: and this,\nbecause my little spot will sooner yield frankincense and pepper than\ngrapes; nor is there a tavern near, which can supply you with wine; nor\na minstrel harlot, to whose thrumming you may dance, cumbersome to the\nground: and yet you exercise with plowshares the fallows that have been\na long while untouched, you take due care of the ox when unyoked, and\ngive him his fill with leaves stripped [from the boughs].

There there is no one who reduces my possessions with\nenvious eye, nor poisons them with obscure malice and biting slander;\nthe neighbors smile at me removing clods and stones. You had rather be\nmunching your daily allowance with the slaves in town; you earnestly\npray to be of the number of these: [while my] cunning foot-boy envies\nyou the use of the firing, the flocks and the garden.

My course must be altered, and my horse driven beyond his\naccustomed stages. Whither are you going? will the angry rider say,\npulling in the left-hand rein, I am not bound for Cumae or Baiae:–but\nthe horse’s ear is in the bit.)

        "When Maenius, having bravely made away with his paternal and maternal\nestates, began to be accounted a merry fellow–a vagabond droll, who had\nno certain place of living; who, when dinnerless, could not distinguish\na fellow-citizen from an enemy; unmerciful in forging any scandal\nagainst any person; the pest, and hurricane, and gulf of the market;\nwhatever he could get, he gave to his greedy gut. This fellow, when he\nhad extorted little or nothing from the favorers of his iniquity, or\nthose that dreaded it, would eat up whole dishes of coarse tripe and\nlamb’s entrails; as much as would have sufficed three bears; then truly,\n[like] reformer Bestius, would he say, that the bellies of extravagant\nfellows ought to be branded with a red-hot iron. The same man [however],\nwhen he had reduced to smoke and ashes whatever more considerable booty\nhe had gotten; ’Faith, said he, I do not wonder if some persons eat up\ntheir estates; since nothing is better than a fat thrush, nothing finer\nthan a lage sow’s paunch. In fact, I am just such another myself; for,\nwhen matters are a little deficient, I commend, the snug and homely\nfare, of sufficient resolution amid mean provisions; but, if any thing\nbe offered better and more delicate, I, the same individual, cry out,\nthat ye are wise and alone live well, whose wealth and estate are\nconspicuous from the elegance of your villas.",

        "Ask me not, my best Quinctius, whether my farm maintains its master with\ncorn-fields, or enriches him with olives, or with fruits, or meadow\nland, or the elm tree clothed with vines: the shape and situation of my\nground shall be described to you at large.",
        "There is a continued range of mountains, except where they are separated\nby a shadowy vale; but in such a manner, that the approaching sun views\nit on the right side, and departing in his flying car warms the left.\nYou would commend its temperature. What? If my [very] briers produce in\nabundance the ruddy cornels and damsens? If my oak and holm tree\naccommodate my cattle with plenty of acorns, and their master with a\ncopious shade? You would say that Tarentum, brought nearer [to Rome],\nshone in its verdant beauty. A fountain too, deserving to give name to a\nriver, insomuch that Hebrus does not surround Thrace more cool or more\nlimpid, flows salubrious to the infirm head, salubrious to the bowels.\nThese sweet, yea now (if you will credit me) these delightful retreats\npreserve me to you in a state of health [even] in the September season.",
        "You live well, if you take care to support the character which you bear.\nLong ago, all Rome has proclaimed you happy: but I am apprehensive, lest\nyou should give more credit concerning yourself to any one than\nyourself; and lest you should imagine a man happy, who differs from the\nwise and good; or, because the people pronounce you sound and perfectly\nwell, lest you dissemble the lurking fever at meal-times, until a\ntrembling seize your greased hands. The false modesty of fools conceals\nulcers [rather than have them cured]. If any one should mention battles\nwhich you had fought by land and sea, and in such expressions as these\nshould soothe your listening ears: “May Jupiter, who consults the safety\nboth of you and of the city, keep it in doubt, whether the people be\nmore solicitous for your welfare, or you for the people’s;” you might\nperceive these encomiums to belong [only] to Augustus when you suffer\nyourself to be termed a philosopher, and one of a refined life; say,\npr’ythee, would you answer [to these appellations] in your own name? To\nbe sure–I like to be called a wise and good man, as well as you. He who\ngave this character to-day, if he will, can take it away to-morrow: as\nthe same people, if they have conferred the consulship on an unworthy\nperson, may take it away from him: “Resign; it is ours,” they cry: I do\nresign it accordingly, and chagrined withdraw. Thus if they should call\nme rogue, deny me to be temperate, assert that I had strangled my own\nfather with a halter; shall I be stung, and change color at these false\nreproaches? Whom does false honor delight, or lying calumny terrify,\nexcept the vicious and sickly-minded? Who then is a good man? He who\nobserves the decrees of the senate, the laws and rules of justice; by\nwhose arbitration many and important disputes are decided; by whose\nsurety private property, and by whose testimony causes are safe. Yet\n[perhaps] his own family and all the neighborhood observe this man,\nspecious in a fair outside, [to be] polluted within. If a slave should\nsay to me, “I have not committed a robbery, nor run away:” “You have\nyour reward; you are not galled with the lash,” I reply. “I have not\nkilled any man:” “You shall not [therefore] feed the carrion crows on\nthe cross.” I am a good man, and thrifty: your Sabine friend denies, and\ncontradicts the fact. For the wary wolf dreads the pitfall, and the hawk\nthe suspected snares, and the kite the concealed hook. The good, [on the\ncontrary,] hate to sin from the love of virtue; you will commit no crime\nmerely for the fear of punishment. Let there be a prospect of escaping,\nyou will confound sacred and profane things together. For, when from a\nthousand bushels of beans you filch one, the loss in that case to me is\nless, but not your villainy. The honest man, whom every forum and every\ncourt of justice looks upon with reverence, whenever he makes an\natonement to the gods with a wine or an ox; after he has pronounced in a\nclear distinguishable voice, “O father Janus, O Apollo;” moves his lips\nas one afraid of being heard; “O fair Laverna put it in my power to\ndeceive; grant me the appearance of a just and upright man: throw a\ncloud of night over my frauds.” I do not see how a covetous man can be\nbetter, how more free than a slave, when he stoops down for the sake of\na penny, stuck in the road [for sport]. For he who will be covetous,\nwill also be anxious: but he that lives in a state of anxiety, will\nnever in my estimation be free. He who is always in a hurry, and\nimmersed in the study of augmenting his fortune, has lost the arms, and\ndeserted the post of virtue. Do not kill your captive, if you can sell\nhim: he will serve you advantageously: let him, being inured to\ndrudgery, feed [your cattle], and plow; let him go to sea, and winter in\nthe midst of the waves; let him be of use to the market, and import corn\nand provisions. A good and wise man will have courage to say, “Pentheus,\nking of Thebes, what indignities will you compel me to suffer and\nendure. ’I will take away your goods:’ my cattle, I suppose, my land, my\nmovables and money: you may take them. ’I will confine you with\nhandcuffs and fetters under a merciless jailer.’ The deity himself will\ndischarge me, whenever I please.” In my opinion, this is his meaning; I\nwill die.

        "If pleasant rest, and sleep till seven o’clock, delight you; if dust and\nthe rumbling of wheels, if the tavern offend you, I shall order you off\nfor Ferentinum. For joys are not the property of the rich alone: nor\nhas he lived ill, who at his birth and at his death has passed\nunnoticed. If you are disposed to be of service to your friends, and to\ntreat yourself with somewhat more indulgence, you, being poor, must pay\nyour respects to the great. Aristippus, if he could dine to his\nsatisfaction on herbs, would never frequent [the tables] of the great.\nIf he who blames me, [replies Aristippus,] knew how to live with the\ngreat, he would scorn his vegetables. Tell me, which maxim and conduct\nof the two you approve; or, since you are my junior, hear the reason why\nAristippus’ opinion is preferable; for thus, as they report, he baffled\nthe snarling cynic: “I play the buffoon for my own advantage, you [to\nplease] the populace. This [conduct of mine] is better and far more\nhonorable; that a horse may carry and a great man feed me, pay court to\nthe great: you beg for refuse, an inferior to the [poor] giver; though\nyou pretend you are in want of nothing.” As for Aristippus, every\ncomplexion of life, every station and circumstance sat gracefully upon\nhim, aspiring in general to greater things, yet equal to the present: on\nthe other hand, I shall be much surprised, if a contrary way of life\nshould become [this cynic], whom obstinacy clothes with a double rag.\nThe one will not wait for his purple robe; but dressed in any thing,\nwill go through the most frequented places, and without awkwardness\nsupport either character: the other will shun the cloak wrought at\nMiletus with greater aversion than [the bite of] dog or viper; he will\ndie with cold, unless you restore him his ragged garment; restore it,\nand let him live like a fool as he is. To perform exploits, and show the\ncitizens their foes in chains, reaches the throne of Jupiter, and aims\nat celestial honors. To have been acceptable to the great, is not the\nlast of praises. It is not every man’s lot to gain Corinth. He\n[prudently] sat still who was afraid lest he should not succeed: be it\nso; what then? Was it not bravely done by him, who carried his point?\nEither here therefore, or nowhere, is what we are investigating. The one\ndreads the burden, as too much for a pusillanimous soul and a weak\nconstitution; the other under takes, and carries it through. Either\nvirtue is an empty name, or the man who makes the experiment deservedly\nclaims the honor and the reward.",
        "Those who mention nothing of their poverty before their lord, will gain\nmore than the importunate. There is a great difference between modestly\naccepting, or seizing by violence But this was the principle and source\nof every thing [which I alleged].

There is an opposite vice to\nthis, rather the greater [of the two]; a clownish, inelegant, and\ndisagreeable bluntness, which would recommend itself by an unshaven face\nand black teeth; while it desires to be termed pure freedom and true\nsincerity. Virtue is the medium of the two vices; and equally remote\nfrom either. The one is over-prone to complaisance, and a jester of the\nlowest, couch, he so reverences the rich man’s nod, so repeats his\nspeeches, and catches up his falling words; that you would take him for\na school-boy saying his lesson to a rigid master, or a player acting an\nunderpart; another often wrangles about a goat’s hair, and armed engages\nfor any trifle: “That I, truly, should not have the first credit; and\nthat I should not boldly speak aloud, what is my real sentiment–[upon\nsuch terms], another life would be of no value.” But what is the subject\nof this controversy?

For by such means the\namity of the twins Zethus and Amphion, broke off; till the lyre,\ndisliked by the austere brother, was silent. Amphion is thought to have\ngiven way to his brother’s humors; so do you yield to the gentle\ndictates of your friend in power: as often as he leads forth his dogs\ninto the fields and his cattle laden with Aetolian nets, arise and lay\naside the peevishness of your unmannerly muse, that you may sup together\non the delicious fare purchased by your labor; an exercise habitual to\nthe manly Romans, of service to their fame and life and limbs:\nespecially when you are in health, and are able either to excel the dog\nin swiftness, or the boar in strength. Add [to this], that there is no\none who handles martial weapons more gracefully.

        "In every thing you must read and consult the learned, by what means you\nmay be enabled to pass your life in an agreeable manner: that insatiable\ndesire may not agitate and torment you, nor the fear and hope of things\nthat are but of little account: whether learning acquires virtue, or\nnature bestows it? What lessens cares, what may endear you to yourself?\nWhat perfectly renders the temper calm; honor or enticing lucre, or a\nsecret passage and the path of an unnoticed life?",

Why, that my fortune may remain as it is now; or even [if it be\nsomething] less: and that I may live to myself, what remains of my time,\nif the gods will that aught do remain: that I may have a good store of\nbooks, and corn provided for the year; lest I fluctuate in suspense of\neach uncertain hour.

        "He shows the folly of some persons who would imitate; and the envy of\nothers who would censure him.",
        "O learned Maecenas, if you believe old Gratinus, no verses which are\nwritten by water-drinkers can please, or be long-lived. Ever since\nBacchus enlisted the brain-sick poets among the Satyrs and the Fauns,\nthe sweet muses have usually smelt of wine in the morning. Homer, by his\nexcessive praises of wine, is convicted as a booser: father Ennius\nhimself never sallied forth to sing of arms, unless in drink. “I will\ncondemn the sober to the bar and the prater’s bench, and deprive the\nabstemious of the power of singing.”",
        "As soon as he gave out this edict, the poets did not cease to contend in\nmidnight cups, and to smell of them by day. What! if any savage, by a\nstern countenance and bare feet, and the texture of a scanty gown,\nshould imitate Cato; will he represent the virtue and morals of Cato?\nThe tongue that imitated Timagenes was the destruction of the Moor,\nwhile he affected to be humorous, and attempted to seem eloquent. The\nexample that is imitable in its faults, deceives [the ignorant]. Soh! if\nI was to grow up pale by accident, [these poetasters] would drink the\nblood-thinning cumin. O ye imitators, ye servile herd, how often your\nbustlings have stirred my bile, how often my mirth!",
        "I was the original, who set my free footsteps upon the vacant sod; I\ntrod not in the steps of others. He who depends upon himself, as leader,\ncommands the swarm. I first showed to Italy the Parian iambics:\nfollowing the numbers and spirit of Archilochus, but not his subject and\nstyle, which afflicted Lycambes. You must not, however, crown me with a\nmore sparing wreath, because I was afraid to alter the measure and\nstructure of his verse: for the manly Sappho governs her muse by the\nmeasures of Archilochus, so does Alcaeus; but differing from him in the\nmaterials and disposition [of his lines], neither does he seek for a\nfather-in-law whom he may defame with his fatal lampoons, nor does he\ntie a rope for his betrothed spouse in scandalous verse. Him too, never\ncelebrated by any other tongue, I the Roman lyrist first made known. It\ndelights me, as I bring out new productions, to be perused by the eyes,\nand held in the hands of the ingenuous.",
        "Would you know why the ungrateful reader extols and is fond of many\nworks at home, unjustly decries them without doors? I hunt not after the\napplause of the inconstant vulgar, at the expense of entertainments, and\nfor the bribe of a worn-out colt: I am not an auditor of noble writers,\nnor a vindictive reciter, nor condescend to court the tribes and desks\nof the grammarians. Hence are these tears. If I say that “I am ashamed\nto repeat my worthless writings to crowded theatres, and give an air of\nconsequence to trifles:” “You ridicule us,” says [one of them], “and you\nreserve those pieces for the ears of Jove: you are confident that it is\nyou alone that can distill the poetic honey, beautiful in your own\neyes.” At these words I am afraid to turn up my nose; and lest I should\nbe torn by the acute nails of my adversary, “This place is\ndisagreeable,” I cry out, “and I demand a prorogation of the contest.\"\nFor contest is wont to beget trembling emulation and strife, and strife\ncruel enmities and funereal war.",

        "In vain he endeavors to retain his book, desirous of getting abroad;\ntells it what trouble it is to undergo, and imparts some things to be\nsaid of him to posterity.\nYou seem, my book, to look wistfully at Janus and Vertumnus; to the end\nthat you may be set out for sale, neatly polished by the pumice-stone of\nthe Sosii. You hate keys and seals, which are agreeable to a modest\n[volume]; you grieve that you are shown but to a few, and extol public\nplaces; though educated in another manner. Away with you, whither you\nare so solicitous of going down: there will be no returning for you,\nwhen you are once sent out. “Wretch that I am, what have I done? What\ndid I want?\"–you will say: when any one gives you ill treatment, and\nyou know that you will be squeezed into small compass, as soon as the\neager reader is satiated. But, if the augur be not prejudiced by\nresentment of your error, you shall be caressed at Rome [only] till your\nyouth be passed. When, thumbed by the hands of the vulgar, you begin to\ngrow dirty; either you shall in silence feed the grovelling book-worms,\nor you shall make your escape to Utica, or shall be sent bound to\nIlerda. Your disregarded adviser shall then laugh [at you]: as he, who\nin a passion pushed his refractory ass over the precipice. For who would\nsave [an ass] against his will? This too awaits you, that faltering\ndotage shall seize on you, to teach boys their rudiments in the skirts\nof the city. But when the abating warmth of the sun shall attract more\nears, you shall tell them, that I was the son of a freedman, and\nextended my wings beyond my nest; so that, as much as you take away from\nmy family, you may add to my merit: that I was in favor with the first\nmen in the state, both in war and peace; of a short stature, gray\nbefore my time, calculated for sustaining heat, prone to passion, yet so\nas to be soon appeased. If any one should chance to inquire my age; let\nhim know that I had completed four times eleven Decembers, in the year\nin which Lollius admitted Lepidus as his colleague.",
        "EPISTLE I.",
        "TO AUGUSTUS.",
        "He honors him with the highest compliments; then treats copiously of\npoetry, its origin, character, and excellence.",
        "Since you alone support so many and such weighty concerns, defend Italy\nwith your arms, adorn it by your virtue, reform it by your laws; I\nshould offend, O Caesar, against the public interests, if I were to\ntrespass upon your time with a long discourse.",
        "Romulus, and father Bacchus, and Castor and Pollux, after great\nachievements, received into the temples of the gods, while they were\nimproving the world and human nature, composing fierce dissensions,\nsettling property, building cities, lamented that the esteem which they\nexpected was not paid in proportion to their merits. He who crushed the\ndire Hydra, and subdued the renowned monsters by his forefated labor,\nfound envy was to be tamed by death [alone]. For he burns by his very\nsplendor, whose superiority is oppressive to the arts beneath him: after\nhis decease, he shall be had in honor. On you, while present among us,\nwe confer mature honors, and rear altars where your name is to be sworn\nby; confessing that nothing equal to you has hitherto risen, or will\nhereafter rise. But this your people, wise and just in one point (for\npreferring you to our own, you to the Grecian heroes), by no means\nestimate other things with like proportion and measure: and disdain and\ndetest every thing, but what they see removed from earth and already\ngone by; such favorers are they of antiquity, as to assert that the\nMuses [themselves] upon Mount Alba, dictated the twelve tables,\nforbidding to trangress, which the decemviri ratified; the leagues of\nour kings concluded with the Gabii, or the rigid Sabines; the records of\nthe pontifices, and the ancient volumes of the augurs.",
        "If, because the most ancient writings of the Greeks are also the best,\nRoman authors are to be weighed in the same scale, there is no need we\nshould say much: there is nothing hard in the inside of an olive,\nnothing [hard] in the outside of a nut. We are arrived at the highest\npitch of success [in arts]: we paint, and sing, and wrestle more\nskillfully than the annointed Greeks. If length of time makes poems\nbetter, as it does wine, I would fain know how many years will stamp a\nvalue upon writings. A writer who died a hundred years ago, is he to be\nreckoned among the perfect and ancient, or among the mean and modern\nauthors? Let some fixed period exclude all dispute. He is an old and\ngood writer who completes a hundred years. What! one that died a month\nor a year later, among whom is he to be ranked? Among the old poets, or\namong those whom both the present age and posterity will disdainfully\nreject? He may fairly be placed among the ancients, who is younger\neither by a short month only, or even by a whole year. I take the\nadvantage of this concession, and pull away by little and little, as [if\nthey were] the hairs of a horse’s tail: and I take away a single one and\nthen again another single one; till, like a tumbling heap, [my\nadversary], who has recourse to annals and estimates excellence by the\nyear, and admires nothing but what Libitina has made sacred, falls to\nthe ground.",
        "Ennius the wise, the nervous, and (as our critics say) a second Homer,\nseems lightly to regard what becomes of his promises and Pythagorean\ndreams. Is not Naevius in people’s hands, and sticking almost fresh in\ntheir memory? So sacred is every ancient poem. As often as a debate\narises, whether this poet or the other be preferable; Pacuvius bears\naway the character of a learned, Accius, of a lofty writer; Afranius’\ngown is said to have fitted Menander; Plautus, to hurry after the\npattern of the Sicilian Epicharmus; Caecilius, to excel in gravity,\nTerence in contrivance. These mighty Rome learns by heart, and these she\nviews crowded in her narrow theater; these she esteems and accounts her\npoets from Livy the writer’s age down to our time. Sometimes the\npopulace see right; sometimes they are wrong. If they admire and extol\nthe ancient poets so as to prefer nothing before, to compare nothing\nwith them, they err; if they think and allow that they express some\nthings in an obsolete, most in a stiff, many in a careless manner; they\nboth think sensibly, and agree with me, and determine with the assent of\nJove himself. Not that I bear an ill-will against Livy’s epics, and\nwould doom them to destruction, which I remember the severe Orbilius\ntaught me when a boy; but they should seem correct, beautiful, and very\nlittle short of perfect, this I wonder at: among which if by chance a\nbright expression shines forth, and if one line or two [happen to be]\nsomewhat terse and musical, this unreasonably carries off and sells the\nwhole poem. I am disgusted that any thing should be found fault with,\nnot because it is a lumpish composition or inelegant, but because it is\nmodern; and that not a favorable allowance, but honor and rewards are\ndemanded for the old writers. Should I scruple, whether or not Atta’s\ndrama trod the saffron and flowers in a proper manner, almost all the\nfathers would cry out that modesty was lost; since I attempted to find\nfault with those pieces which the pathetic Aesopus, which the skillful\nRoscius acted: either because they esteem nothing right, but what has\npleased themselves; or because they think it disgraceful to submit to\ntheir juniors, and to confess, now they are old, that what they learned\nwhen young is deserving only to be destroyed. Now he who extols Numa’s\nSalian hymn, and would alone seem to understand that which, as well as\nme, he is ignorant of, does not favor and applaud the buried geniuses,\nbut attacks ours, enviously hating us moderns and every thing of ours.\nWhereas if novelty had been detested by the Greeks as much as by us,\nwhat at this time would there have been ancient? Or what what would\nthere have been for common use to read and thumb, common to every body.",
        "When first Greece, her wars being over, began to trifle, and through\nprosperity to glide into folly; she glowed with the love, one while of\nwrestlers, another while of horses; was fond of artificers in marble, or\nin ivory, or in brass; hung her looks and attention upon a picture; was\ndelighted now with musicians, now with tragedians; as if an infant girl\nshe sported under the nurse; soon cloyed, she abandoned what [before]\nshe earnestly desired. What is there that pleases or is odious, which\nyou may not think mutable? This effect had happy times of peace, and\nfavorable gales [of fortune].",
        "At Rome it was long pleasing and customary to be up early with open\ndoors, to expound the laws to clients; to lay out money cautiously upon\ngood securities: to hear the elder, and to tell the younger by what\nmeans their fortunes might increase and pernicious luxury be diminished.\nThe inconstant people have changed their mind, and glow with a universal\nardor for learning: young men and grave fathers sup crowned with leaves,\nand dictate poetry. I myself, who affirm that I write no verses, am\nfound more false than the Parthians: and, awake before the sun is risen,\nI call for my pen and papers and desk. He that is ignorant of a ship is\nafraid to work a ship; none but he who has learned, dares administer\n[even] southern wood to the sick; physicians undertake what belongs to\nphysicians; mechanics handle tools; but we, unlearned and learned,\npromiscuously write poems.",
        "Yet how great advantages this error and this slight madness has, thus\ncompute: the poet’s mind is not easily covetous; fond of verses, he\nstudies this alone; he laughs at losses, flights of slaves, fires; he\ncontrives no fraud against his partner, or his young ward; he lives on\nhusks, and brown bread; though dastardly and unfit for war, he is useful\nat home, if you allow this, that great things may derive assistance from\nsmall ones. The poet fashions the child’s tender and lisping mouth, and\nturns his ear even at this time from obscene language; afterward also he\nforms his heart with friendly precepts, the corrector of his rudeness,\nand envy, and passion; he records virtuous actions, he instructs the\nrising age with approved examples, he comforts the indigent and the\nsick. Whence should the virgin, stranger to a husband, with the chaste\nboys, learn the solemn prayer, had not the muse given a poet? The chorus\nentreats the divine aid, and finds the gods propitious; sweet in learned\nprayer, they implore the waters of the heavens; avert diseases, drive\noff impending dangers, obtain both peace and years enriched with fruits.\nWith song the gods above are appeased, with song the gods below.",
        "Our ancient swains, stout and happy with a little, after the grain was\nlaid up, regaling in a festival season their bodies and even their\nminds, patient of hardships through the hope of their ending, with their\nslaves and faithful wife, the partners of their labors, atoned with a\nhog [the goddess] Earth, with milk Silvanus, with flowers and wine the\ngenius that reminds us of our short life. Invented by this custom, the\nFemminine licentiousness poured forth its rustic taunts in alternate\nstanzas; and this liberty, received down through revolving years,\nsported pleasingly; till at length the bitter raillery began to be\nturned into open rage, and threatening with impunity to stalk through\nreputable families. They, who suffered from its bloody tooth smarted\nwith the pain; the unhurt likewise were concerned for the common\ncondition: further also, a law and a penalty were enacted, which forbade\nthat any one should be stigmatized in lampoon. Through fear of the\nbastinado, they were reduced to the necessity of changing their manner,\nand of praising and delighting.",
        "Captive Greece took captive her fierce conqueror, and introduced her\narts into rude Latium. Thus flowed off the rough Saturnian numbers, and\ndelicacy expelled the rank venom: but for a long time there remained,\nand at this day remain traces of rusticity. For late [the Roman writer]\napplied his genius to the Grecian pages; and enjoying rest after the\nPunic wars, began to search what useful matter Sophocles, and Thespis,\nand Aeschylus afforded: he tried, too, if he could with dignity\ntranslate their works; and succeeded in pleasing himself, being by\nnature [of a genius] sublime and strong; for he breathes a spirit tragic\nenough, and dares successfully; but fears a blot, and thinks it\ndisgraceful in his writings.",
        "Comedy is believed to require the least pains, because it fetches its\nsubjects from common life; but the less indulgence It meets with, the\nmore labor it requires. See how Plautus supports the character of a\nlover under age, how that of a covetous father, how those of a cheating\npimp: how Dossennus exceeds all measure in his voracious parasites; with\nhow loose a sock he runs over the stage: for he is glad to put the money\nin his pocket, after this regardless whether his play stand or fall.",
        "Him, whom glory in her airy car has brought upon the stage, the careless\nspectator dispirits, the attentive renders more diligent: so slight, so\nsmall a matter it is, which overturns or raises a mind covetous of\npraise! Adieu the ludicrous business [of dramatic writing], if applause\ndenied brings me back meagre, bestowed [makes me] full of flesh and\nspirits.",
        "This too frequently drives away and deters even an adventurous poet?\nthat they who are in number more, in worth and rank inferior, unlearned\nand foolish, and (if the equestrian order dissents) ready to fall to\nblows, in the midst of the play, call for either a bear or boxers; for\nin these the mob delight. Nay, even all the pleasures of our knights is\nnow transferred from the ear to the uncertain eye, and their vain\namusements. The curtains are kept down for four hours or more, while\ntroops of horse and companies of foot flee over the stage: next is\ndragged forward the fortune of kings, with their hands bound behind\nthem; chariots, litters, carriages, ships hurry on; captive ivory,\ncaptive Corinth, is borne along. Democritus, if he were on earth, would\nlaugh; whether a panther a different genus confused with the camel, or a\nwhite elephant attracted the eye of the crowd. He would view the people\nmore attentively than the sports themselves, as affording him more\nstrange sights than the actor: and for the writers, he would think they\ntold their story to a deaf ass. For what voices are able to overbear the\ndin with which our theatres resound? You would think the groves of\nGarganus, or the Tuscan Sea, was roaring; with so great noise are viewed\nthe shows and contrivances, and foreign riches: with which the actor\nbeing daubed over, as soon as he appears upon the stage, each right hand\nencounters with the left. Has he said any thing yet? Nothing at all.\nWhat then pleases? The cloth imitating [the color of] violets, with the\ndye of Tarentum.",
        "And, that you may not think I enviously praise those kinds of writing\nwhich I decline undertaking, when others handle them well: that poet to\nme seems able to walk upon an extended rope, who with his fictions\ngrieves my soul, enrages, soothes, fills it with false terrors, as an\nenchanter; and sets me now in Thebes, now in Athens.",
        "But of those too, who had rather trust themselves with a reader, than\nbear the disdain of an haughty spectator, use a little care; if you\nwould fill with books [the library you have erected], an offering worthy\nof Apollo, and add an incentive to the poets, that with greater\neagerness they may apply to verdant Helicon.",
        "We poets, it is true (that I may hew down my own vineyards), often do\nourselves many mischiefs, when we present a work to you while thoughtful\nor fatigued; when we are pained, if my friend has dared to find fault\nwith one line; when, unasked, we read over again passages already\nrepeated: when we lament that our labors do not appear, and war poems,\nspun out in a fine thread: when we hope the thing will come to this,\nthat as soon as you are apprised we are penning verses, you will kindly\nof yourself send for us and secure us from want, and oblige us to write.\nBut yet it is worth while to know, who shall be the priests of your\nvirtue signalized in war and at home, which is not to be trusted to an\nunworthy poet. A favorite of king Alexander the Great was that\nChoerilus, who to his uncouth and ill-formed verses owed the many pieces\nhe received of Philip’s royal coin. But, as ink when touched leaves\nbehind it a mark and a blot, so writers as it were stain shining actions\nwith foul poetry. That same king, who prodigally bought so dear so\nridiculous a poem, by an edict forbade that any one beside Apelles\nshould paint him, or that any other than Lysippus should mold brass for\nthe likeness of the valiant Alexander. But should you call that faculty\nof his, so delicate in discerning other arts, to [judge of] books and of\nthese gifts of the muses, you would swear he had been born in the gross\nair of the Boeotians. Yet neither do Virgil and Varius, your beloved\npoets, disgrace your judgment of them, and the presents which they have\nreceived with great honor to the donor; nor do the features of\nillustrious men appear more lively when expressed by statues of brass,\nthan their manners and minds expressed by the works of a poet. Nor would\nI rather compose such tracts as these creeping on the ground, than\nrecord deeds of arms, and the situations of countries, and rivers, and\nforts reared upon mountains, and barbarous kingdoms, and wars brought to\na conclusion through the whole world under your auspices, and the\nbarriers that confine Janus the guardian of peace, and Rome treaded by\nthe Parthians under your government, if I were but able to do as much as\nI could wish. But neither does your majesty admit of humble poetry, nor\ndares my modesty attempt a subject which my strength is unable to\nsupport. Yet officiousness foolishly disgusts the person whom it loves;\nespecially when it recommends itself by numbers, and the art [of\nwriting]. For one learns sooner, and more willingly remembers, that\nwhich a man derides, than that which he approves and venerates. I value\nnot the zeal that gives me uneasiness; nor do I wish to be set out any\nwhere in wax with a face formed for the worse, nor to be celebrated in\nill-composed verses; lest I blush, when presented with the gross gift;\nand, exposed in an open box along with my author, be conveyed into the\nstreet that sells frankincense, and spices, and pepper, and whatever is\nwrapped up in impertinent writings.",

Lavish promises lessen credit, when any one cries up\nextravagantly the wares he has for sale, which he wants to put off. No\nemergency obliges me [to dispose of him]: though poor, I am in nobody’s\ndebt. None of the chapmen would do this for you; nor should every body\nreadily receive the same favor from me.

Give me your money, if this runaway trick, which\nI have expected, does not offend you.” In my opinion, the man may take\nhis price, and be secure from any punishment: you wittingly purchased a\ngood-for-nothing boy: the condition of the contract was told you.\nNevertheless you prosecute this man, and detain him in an unjust suit.",
        "I told you, at your setting out, that I was indolent: I told you I was\nalmost incapable of such offices: that you might not chide me in angry\nmood, because no letter [from me] came to hand.

        "A soldier of Lucullus, [having run through] a great many hardships, was\nrobbed of his collected stock to a penny, as he lay snoring in the night\nquite fatigued: after this, like a ravenous wolf, equally exasperated at\nhimself and the enemy, eager, with his hungry fangs, he beat off a royal\nguard from a post (as they report) very strongly fortified, and well\nsupplied with stores. Famous on account of this exploit, he is adorned\nwith honorable rewards, and receives twenty thousand sesterces into the\nbargain. It happened about this time that his officer being inclined to\nbatter down a certain fort, began to encourage the same man, with words\nthat might even have given courage to a coward: “Go, my brave fellow,\nwhither your valor calls you: go with prosperous step, certain to\nreceive ample rewards for your merit.

But the troublesome times removed me from that\npleasant spot; and the tide of a civil war carried me away,\nunexperienced as I was, into arms, [into arms] not likely to be a match\nfor the sinews of Augustus Caesar.

        "Those who make bad verses are laughed at: but they are pleased in\nwriting, and reverence themselves; and if you are silent, they, happy,\nfall to praising of their own accord whatever they have written. But he\nwho desires to execute a genuine poem, will with his papers assume the\nspirit of an honest critic: whatever words shall have but little\nclearness and elegance, or shall be without weight and held unworthy of\nestimation, he will dare to displace: though they may recede with\nreluctance, and still remain in the sanctuary of Vesta: those that have\nbeen long hidden from the people he kindly will drag forth, and bring to\nlight those expressive denominations of things that were used by the\nCatos and Cethegi of ancient times, though now deformed dust and\nneglected age presses upon them: he will adopt new words, which use, the\nparent [of language], shall produce: forcible and perspicuous, and\nbearing the utmost similitude to a limpid stream, he will pour out his\ntreasures, and enrich Latium with a comprehensive language. The\nluxuriant he will lop, the too harsh he will soften with a sensible\ncultivation: those void of expression he will discard: he will exhibit\nthe appearance of one at play; and will be [in his invention] on the\nrack, like [a dancer on the stage], who one while affects the motions of\na satyr, at another of a clumsy cyclops.",
        "I had rather be esteemed a foolish and dull writer, while my faults\nplease myself, or at least escape my notice, than be wise and smart for\nit. There lived at Argos a man of no mean rank, who imagined that he was\nhearing some admirable tragedians, a joyful sitter and applauder in an\nempty theater: who [nevertheless] could support the other duties of life\nin a just manner; a truly honest neighbor, an amiable host, kind toward\nhis wife, one who could pardon his slaves, nor would rave at the\nbreaking of a bottle-seal: one who [had sense enough] to avoid a\nprecipice, or an open well. This man, being cured at the expense and by\nthe care of his relations, when he had expelled by the means of pure\nhellebore the disorder and melancholy humor, and returned to himself;\n\"By Pollux, my friends (said he), you have destroyed, not saved me; from\nwhom my pleasure is thus taken away, and a most agreeable delusion of\nmind removed by force.”",
        "In a word, it is of the first consequence to be wise in the rejection\nof trifles, and leave childish play to boys for whom it is in season,\nand not to scan words to be set to music for the Roman harps, but\n[rather] to be perfectly an adept in the numbers and proportions of real\nlife. Thus therefore I commune with myself, and ponder these things in\nsilence: “If no quantity of water would put an end to your thirst, you\nwould tell it to your physicians. And is there none to whom you dare\nconfess, that the more you get the more you crave? If you had a wound\nwhich was not relieved by a plant or root prescribed to you, you would\nrefuse being doctored with a root or plant that did no good. You have\nheard that vicious folly left the man, on whom the gods conferred\nwealth; and though you are nothing wiser, since you become richer, will\nyou nevertheless use the same monitors as before? But could riches make\nyou wise, could they make you less covetous and mean-spirited, you well\nmight blush, if there lived on earth one more avaricious than yourself.”",
        "If that be any man’s property, which he has bought by the pound and\npenny, [and] there be some things to which (if you give credit to the\nlawyers) possession gives a claim, [then] the field that feeds you is\nyour own; and Orbius’ steward, when he harrows the corn which is soon to\ngive you flour, finds you are [in effect] the proper master. You give\nyour money; you receive grapes, pullets, eggs, a hogshead of strong\nwine: certainly in this manner you by little and little purchase that\nfarm, for which perhaps the owner paid three hundred thousand sesterces,\nor more. What does it signify, whether you live on what was paid for the\nother day, or a long while ago? He who purchased the Aricinian and\nVeientine fields some time since, sups on bought vegetables, however he\nmay think otherwise; boils his pot with bought wood at the approach of\nthe chill evening. But he calls all that his own, as far as where the\nplanted poplar prevents quarrels among neighbors by a determinate\nlimitation: as if anything were a man’s property, which in a moment of\nthe fleeting hour, now by solicitations, now by sale, now by violence,\nand now by the supreme lot [of all men], may change masters and come\ninto another’s jurisdiction. Thus since the perpetual possession is\ngiven to none, and one man’s heir urges on another’s, as wave impels\nwave, of what importance are houses, or granaries; or what the Lucanian\npastures joined to the Calabrian; if Hades, inexorable to gold, mows\ndown the great together with the small?",
        "Gems, marble, ivory, Tuscan statues, pictures, silver-plate, robes dyed\nwith Getulian purple, there are who can not acquire; and there are\nothers, who are not solicitous of acquiring. Of two brothers, why one\nprefers lounging, play, and perfume, to Herod’s rich palm-tree groves;\nwhy the other, rich and uneasy, from the rising of the light to the\nevening shade, subdues his woodland with fire and steel: our attendant\ngenius knows, who governs the planet of our nativity, the divinity [that\npresides] over human nature, who dies with each individual, of various\ncomplexion, white and black.",
        "I will use, and take out from my moderate stock, as much as my exigence\ndemands: nor will I be under any apprehensions what opinion my heir\nshall hold concerning me, when he shall, find [I have left him] no more\nthan I had given me. And yet I, the same man, shall be inclined to know\nhow far an open and cheerful person differs from a debauchee, and how\ngreatly the economist differs from the miser. For there is some\ndistinction whether you throw away your money in a prodigal manner, or\nmake an entertainment without grudging, nor toil to accumulate more; or\nrather, as formerly in Minerva’s holidays, when a school-boy, enjoys by\nstarts the short and pleasant vacation.",
        "Let sordid poverty be far away. I, whether borne in a large or small\nvessel, let me be borne uniform and the same. I am not wafted with\nswelling sail before the north wind blowing fair: yet I do not bear my\ncourse of life against the adverse south. In force, genius, figure,\nvirtue, station, estate, the last of the first-rate, [yet] still before\nthose of the last.",
        "You are not covetous, [you say]:–go to.–What then? Have the rest of\nyour vices fled from you, together with this? Is your breast free from\nvain ambition? Is it free from the fear of death and from anger? Can you\nlaugh at dreams, magic terrors, wonders, witches, nocturnal goblins, and\nThessalian prodigies? Do you number your birth-days with a grateful\nmind? Are you forgiving to your friends? Do you grow milder and better\nas old age approaches? What profits you only one thorn eradicated out of\nmany? If you do not know how to live in a right manner, make way for\nthose that do. You have played enough, eaten and drunk enough, it is\ntime for you to walk off: lest having tippled too plentifully, that age\nwhich plays the wanton with more propriety, and drive you [off the\nstage].",
        "HORACE’S BOOK UPON THE ART OF POETRY.",
        "TO THE PISOS.",
        "If a painter should wish to unite a horse’s neck to a human head, and\nspread a variety of plumage over limbs [of different animals] taken from\nevery part [of nature], so that what is a beautiful woman in the upper\npart terminates unsightly in an ugly fish below; could you, my friends,\nrefrain from laughter, were you admitted to such a sight? Believe, ye\nPisos, the book will be perfectly like such a picture, the ideas of\nwhich, like a sick man’s dreams, are all vain and fictitious: so that\nneither head nor foot can correspond to any one form. “Poets and\npainters [you will say] have ever had equal authority for attempting any\nthing.” We are conscious of this, and this privilege we demand and allow\nin turn: but not to such a degree, that the tame should associate with\nthe savage; nor that serpents should be coupled with birds, lambs with\ntigers.",
        "In pompous introductions, and such as promise a great deal, it generally\nhappens that one or two verses of purple patch-work, that may make a\ngreat show, are tagged on; as when the grove and the altar of Diana and\nthe meandering of a current hastening through pleasant fields, or the\nriver Rhine, or the rainbow is described. But here there was no room for\nthese [fine things]: perhaps, too, you know how to draw a cypress: but\nwhat is that to the purpose, if he, whe is painted for the given price,\nis [to be represented as] swimming hopeless out of a shipwreck? A large\nvase at first was designed: why, as the wheel revolves, turns out a\nlittle pitcher? In a word, be your subject what it will, let it be\nmerely simple and uniform.",
        "The great majority of us poets, father, and youths worthy such a\nfather, are misled by the appearance of right. I labor to be concise, I\nbecome obscure: nerves and spirit fail him, that aims at the easy: one,\nthat pretends to be sublime, proves bombastical: he who is too cautious\nand fearful of the storm, crawls along the ground: he who wants to vary\nhis subject in a marvelous manner, paints the dolphin in the woods, the\nboar in the sea. The avoiding of an error leads to a fault, if it lack\nskill.",
        "A statuary about the Aemilian school shall of himself, with singular\nskill, both express the nails, and imitate in brass the flexible hair;\nunhappy yet in the main, because he knows not how to finish a complete\npiece. I would no more choose to be such a one as this, had I a mind to\ncompose any thing, than to live with a distorted nose, [though]\nremarkable for black eyes and jetty hair.",
        "Ye who write, make choice of a subject suitable to your abilities; and\nrevolve in your thoughts a considerable time what your strength\ndeclines, and what it is able to support. Neither elegance of style, nor\na perspicuous disposition, shall desert the man, by whom the subject\nmatter is chosen judiciously.",
        "This, or I am mistaken, will constitute the merit and beauty of\narrangement, that the poet just now say what ought just now to be said,\nput off most of his thoughts, and waive them for the present.",
        "In the choice of his words, too, the author of the projected poem must\nbe delicate and cautious, he must embrace one and reject another: you\nwill express yourself eminently well, if a dexterous combination should\ngive an air of novelty to a well-known word. If it happen to be\nnecessary to explain some abstruse subjects by new invented terms; it\nwill follow that you must frame words never heard of by the\nold-fashioned Cethegi: and the license will be granted, if modestly\nused: and the new and lately-formed words will have authority, if they\ndescend from a Greek source, with a slight deviation. But why should the\nRomans grant to Plutus and Caecilius a privilege denied to Virgil and\nVarius? Why should I be envied, if I have it in my power to acquire a\nfew words, when the language of Cato and Ennius has enriched our native\ntongue, and produced new names of things? It has been, and ever will be,\nallowable to coin a word marked with the stamp in present request. As\nleaves in the woods are changed with the fleeting years; the earliest\nfall off first: in this manner words perish with old age, and those\nlately invented nourish and thrive, like men in the time of youth. We,\nand our works, are doomed to death: Whether Neptune, admitted into the\ncontinent, defends our fleet from the north winds, a kingly work; or the\nlake, for a long time unfertile and fit for oars, now maintains its\nneighboring cities and feels the heavy plow; or the river, taught to run\nin a more convenient channel, has changed its course which was so\ndestructive to the fruits. Mortal works must perish: much less can the\nhonor and elegance of language be long-lived. Many words shall revive,\nwhich now have fallen off; and many which are now in esteem shall fall\noff, if it be the will of custom, in whose power is the decision and\nright and standard of language.",
        "Homer has instructed us in what measure the achievements of kings, and\nchiefs, and direful war might be written.",
        "Plaintive strains originally were appropriated to the unequal numbers\n[of the elegiac]: afterward [love and] successful desires were included.\nYet what author first published humble elegies, the critics dispute, and\nthe controversy still waits the determination of a judge.",
        "Rage armed Archilochus with the iambic of his own invention. The sock\nand the majestic buskin assumed this measure as adapted for dialogue,\nand to silence the noise of the populace, and calculated for action.",
        "To celebrate gods, and the sons of gods, and the victorious wrestler,\nand the steed foremost in the race, and the inclination of youths, and\nthe free joys of wine, the muse has alotted to the lyre.",
        "If I am incapable and unskilful to observe the distinction described,\nand the complexions of works [of genius], why am I accosted by the name\nof “Poet?” Why, out of false modesty, do I prefer being ignorant to\nbeing learned?",
        "A comic subject will not be handled in tragic verse: in like manner the\nbanquet of Thyestes will not bear to be held in familiar verses, and\nsuch as almost suit the sock. Let each peculiar species [of writing]\nfill with decorum its proper place. Nevertheless sometimes even comedy\nexalts her voice, and passionate Chremes rails in a tumid strain: and a\ntragic writer generally expresses grief in a prosaic style. Telephus and\nPeleus, when they are both in poverty and exile, throw aside their rants\nand gigantic expressions if they have a mind to move the heart of the\nspectator with their complaint.",
        "It is not enough that poems be beautiful; let them be tender and\naffecting, and bear away the soul of the auditor whithersoever they\nplease. As the human countenance smiles on those that smile, so does it\nsympathize with those that weep. If you would have me weep you must\nfirst express the passion of grief yourself; then, Telephus or Peleus,\nyour misfortunes hurt me: if you pronounce the parts assigned you ill, I\nshall either fall asleep or laugh.",
        "Pathetic accents suit a melancholy countenance; words full of menace, an\nangry one; wanton expressions, a sportive look; and serious matter, an\naustere one. For nature forms us first within to every modification of\ncircumstances; she delights or impels us to anger, or depresses us to\nthe earth and afflicts us with heavy sorrow: then expresses those\nemotions of the mind by the tongue, its interpreter. If the words be\ndiscordant to the station of the speaker, the Roman knights and plebians\nwill raise an immoderate laugh. It will make a wide difference, whether\nit be Davus that speaks, or a hero; a man well-stricken in years, or a\nhot young fellow in his bloom; and a matron of distinction, or an\nofficious nurse; a roaming merchant, or the cultivator of a verdant\nlittle farm; a Colchian, or an Assyrian; one educated at Thebes, or one\nat Argos.",
        "You, that write, either follow tradition, or invent such fables as are\ncongruous to themselves. If as poet you have to represent the renowned\nAchilles; let him be indefatigable, wrathful, inexorable, courageous,\nlet him deny that laws were made for him, let him arrogate every thing\nto force of arms. Let Medea be fierce and untractable, Ino an object of\npity, Ixion perfidious, Io wandering, Orestes in distress.",
        "If you offer to the stage any thing unattempted, and venture to form a\nnew character; let it be preserved to the last such as it set out at the\nbeginning, and be consistent with itself. It is difficult to write with\npropriety on subjects to which all writers have a common claim; and you\nwith more prudence will reduce the Iliad into acts, than if you first\nintroduce arguments unknown and never treated of before. A public story\nwill become your own property, if you do not dwell upon the whole circle\nof events, which is paltry and open to every one; nor must you be so\nfaithful a translator, as to take the pains of rendering [the original]\nword for word; nor by imitating throw yourself into straits, whence\neither shame or the rules of your work may forbid you to retreat.",
        "Nor must you make such an exordium, as the Cyclic writer of old: “I will\nsing the fate of Priam, and the noble war.” What will this boaster\nproduce worthy of all this gaping? The mountains are in labor, a\nridiculous mouse will be brought forth. How much more to the purpose he,\nwho attempts nothing improperly? “Sing for me, my muse, the man who,\nafter the time of the destruction of Troy, surveyed the manners and\ncities of many men.” He meditates not [to produce] smoke from a flash,\nbut out of smoke to elicit fire, that he may thence bring forth his\ninstances of the marvelous with beauty, [such as] Antiphates, Scylla,\nthe Cyclops, and Charybdis. Nor does he date Diomede’s return from\nMeleager’s death, nor trace the rise of the Trojan war from [Leda’s]\neggs: he always hastens on to the event; and hurries away his reader in\nthe midst of interesting circumstances, no otherwise than as if they\nwere [already] known; and what he despairs of, as to receiving a polish\nfrom his touch, he omits; and in such a manner forms his fictions, so\nintermingles the false with the true, that the middle is not\ninconsistent with the beginning, nor the end with the middle.",
        "Do you attend to what I, and the public in my opinion, expect from you\n[as a dramatic writer]. If you are desirous of an applauding spectator,\nwho will wait for [the falling of] the curtain, and till the chorus\ncalls out “your plaudits;” the manners of every age must be marked by\nyou, and a proper decorum assigned to men’s varying dispositions and\nyears. The boy, who is just able to pronounce his words, and prints the\nground with a firm tread, delights to play with his fellows, and\ncontracts and lays aside anger without reason, and is subject to change\nevery hour. The beardless youth, his guardian being at length\ndischarged, joys in horses, and dogs, and the verdure of the sunny\nCampus Martius; pliable as wax to the bent of vice, rough to advisers, a\nslow provider of useful things, prodigal of his money, high-spirited,\nand amorous, and hasty in deserting the objects of his passion. [After\nthis,] our inclinations being changed, the age and spirit of manhood\nseeks after wealth, and [high] connections, is subservient to points of\nhonor; and is cautious of committing any action, which he would\nsubsequently be industrious to correct. Many inconviences encompass a\nman in years; either because he seeks [eagerly] for gain, and abstains\nfrom what he has gotten, and is afraid to make use of it; or because he\ntransacts every thing in a timorous and dispassionate manner, dilatory,\nslow in hope, remiss, and greedy of futurity. Peevish, querulous, a\npanegyrist of former times when he was a boy, a chastiser and censurer\nof his juniors. Our advancing years bring many advantages along with\nthem. Many our declining ones take away. That the parts [therefore]\nbelonging to age may not be given to youth, and those of a man to a boy,\nwe must dwell upon those qualities which are joined and adapted to each\nperson’s age.",
        "An action is either represented on the stage, or being done elsewhere is\nthere related. The things which enter by the ear affect the mind more\nlanguidly, than such as are submitted to the faithful eyes, and what a\nspectator presents to himself. You must not, however, bring upon the\nstage things fit only to be acted behind the scenes: and you must take\naway from view many actions, which elegant description may soon after\ndeliver in presence [of the spectators]. Let not Medea murder her sons\nbefore the people; nor the execrable Atreus openly dress human entrails:\nnor let Progue be metamorphosed into a bird, Cadmus into a serpent.\nWhatever you show to me in this manner, not able to give credit to, I\ndetest.",
        "Let a play which would be inquired after, and though seen, represented\nanew, be neither shorter nor longer than the fifth act. Neither let a\ngod interfere, unless a difficulty worthy a god’s unraveling should\nhappen; nor let a fourth person be officious to speak.",
        "Let the chorus sustain the part and manly character of an actor: nor let\nthem sing any thing between the acts which is not conducive to, and\nfitly coherent with, the main design. Let them both patronize the good,\nand give them friendly advice, and regulate the passionate, and love to\nappease those who swell [with rage]: let them praise the repast of a\nshort meal, and salutary effects of justice, laws, and peace with her\nopen gates; let them conceal what is told to them in confidence, and\nsupplicate and implore the gods that prosperity may return to the\nwretched, and abandon the haughty. The flute, (not as now, begirt with\nbrass and emulous of the trumpet, but) slender and of simple form, with\nfew stops, was of service to accompany and assist the chorus, and with\nits tone was sufficient to fill the rows that were not as yet too\ncrowded, where an audience, easily numbered, as being small and sober,\nchaste and modest, met together. But when the victorious Romans began to\nextend their territories, and an ampler wall encompassed the city, and\ntheir genius was indulged on festivals by drinking wine in the day-time\nwithout censure; a greater freedom arose both, to the numbers [of\npoetry], and the measure [of music]. For what taste could an unlettered\nclown and one just dismissed from labors have, when in company with the\npolite; the base, with the man of honor? Thus the musician added now\nmovements and a luxuriance to the ancient art, and strutting backward\nand forward, drew a length of train over the stage; thus likewise new\nnotes were added to the severity of the lyre, and precipitate eloquence\nproduced an unusual language [in the theater]: and the sentiments [of\nthe chorus, then] expert in teaching useful things and prescient of\nfuturity, differ hardly from the oracular Delphi.",
        "The poet, who first tried his skill in tragic verse for the paltry\n[prize of a] goat, soon after exposed to view wild satyrs naked, and\nattempted raillery with severity, still preserving the gravity [of\ntragedy]: because the spectator on festivals, when heated with wine and\ndisorderly, was to be amused with captivating shows and agreeable\nnovelty. But it will be expedient so to recommend the bantering, so the\nrallying satyrs, so to turn earnest into jest; that none who shall be\nexhibited as a god, none who is introduced as a hero lately conspicuous\nin regal purple and gold, may deviate into the low style of obscure,\nmechanical shops; or, [on the contrary,] while he avoids the ground,\neffect cloudy mist and empty jargon. Tragedy disdaining to prate forth\ntrivial verses, like a matron commanded to dance on the festival days,\nwill assume an air of modesty, even in the midst of wanton satyrs. As a\nwriter of satire, ye Pisos, I shall never be fond of unornamented and\nreigning terms: nor shall I labor to differ so widely from the\ncomplexion of tragedy, as to make no distinction, whether Davus be the\nspeaker. And the bold Pythias, who gained a talent by gulling Simo; or\nSilenus, the guardian and attendant of his pupil-god [Bacchus]. I would\nso execute a fiction taken from a well-known story, that any body might\nentertain hopes of doing the same thing; but, on trial, should sweat and\nlabor in vain. Such power has a just arrangement and connection of the\nparts: such grace may be added to subjects merely common. In my\njudgment the Fauns, that are brought out of the woods, should not be too\ngamesome with their tender strains, as if they were educated in the\ncity, and almost at the bar; nor, on the other hand; should blunder out\ntheir obscene and scandalous speeches. For [at such stuff] all are\noffended, who have a horse, a father, or an estate: nor will they\nreceive with approbation, nor give the laurel crown, as the purchasers\nof parched peas and nuts are delighted with.",
        "A long syllable put after a short one is termed an iambus, a lively\nmeasure, whence also it commanded the name of trimeters to be added to\niambics, though it yielded six beats of time, being similar to itself\nfrom first to last. Not long ago, that it might come somewhat slower and\nwith more majesty to the ear, it obligingly and contentedly admitted\ninto its paternal heritage the steadfast spondees; agreeing however, by\nsocial league, that it was not to depart from the second and fourth\nplace. But this [kind of measure] rarely makes its appearance in the\nnotable trimeters of Accius, and brands the verse of Ennius brought upon\nthe stage with a clumsy weight of spondees, with the imputation of being\ntoo precipitate and careless, or disgracefully accuses him of ignorance\nin his art.",
        "It is not every judge that discerns inharmonious verses, and an\nundeserved indulgence is [in this case] granted to the Roman poets. But\nshall I on this account run riot and write licentiously? Or should not I\nrather suppose, that all the world are to see my faults; secure, and\ncautious [never to err] but with hope of being pardoned? Though,\nperhaps, I have merited no praise, I have escaped censure.",
        "Ye [who are desirous to excel,] turn over the Grecian models by night,\nturn them by day. But our ancestors commended both the numbers of\nPlautus, and his strokes of pleasantry; too tamely, I will not say\nfoolishly, admiring each of them; if you and I but know how to\ndistinguish a coarse joke from a smart repartee, and understand the\nproper cadence, by [using] our fingers and ears.",
        "Thespis is said to have invented a new kind of tragedy, and to have\ncarried his pieces about in carts, which [certain strollers], who had\ntheir faces besmeared with lees of wine, sang and acted. After him\nAeschylus, the inventor of the vizard mask and decent robe, laid the\nstage over with boards of a tolerable size, and taught to speak in lofty\ntone, and strut in the buskin. To these succeeded the old comedy, not\nwithout considerable praise: but its personal freedom degenerated into\nexcess and violence, worthy to be regulated by law; a law was made\naccordingly, and the chorus, the right of abusing being taken away,\ndisgracefully became silent.",
        "Our poets have left no species [of the art] unattempted; nor have those\nof them merited the least honor, who dared to forsake the footsteps of\nthe Greeks, and celebrate domestic facts; whether they have instructed\nus in tragedy, of comedy. Nor would Italy be raised higher by valor and\nfeats of arms, than by its language, did not the fatigue and tediousness\nof using the file disgust every one of our poets. Do you, the decendants\nof Pompilius, reject that poem, which many days and many a blot have not\nten times subdued to the most perfect accuracy. Because Democritus\nbelieves that genius is more successful than wretched art, and excludes\nfrom Helicon all poets who are in their senses, a great number do not\ncare to part with their nails or beard, frequent places of solitude,\nshun the baths. For he will acquire, [he thinks,] the esteem and title\nof a poet, if he neither submits his head, which is not to be cured by\neven three Anticyras, to Licinius the barber. What an unlucky fellow am\nI, who am purged for the bile in spring-time! Else nobody would compose\nbetter poems; but the purchase is not worth the expense. Therefore I\nwill serve instead of a whetstone, which though not able of itself to\ncut, can make steel sharp: so I, who can write no poetry myself, will\nteach the duty and business [of an author]; whence he may be stocked\nwith rich materials; what nourishes and forms the poet; what gives\ngrace, what not; what is the tendency of excellence, what that of error.",
        "To have good sense, is the first principle and fountain of writing well.\nThe Socratic papers will direct you in the choice of your subjects; and\nwords will spontaneously accompany the subject, when it is well\nconceived. He who has learned what he owes to his country, and what to\nhis friends; with what affection a parent, a brother, and a stranger,\nare to be loved; what is the duty of a senator, what of a judge; what\nthe duties of a general sent out to war; he, [I say,] certainly knows\nhow to give suitable attributes to every character. I should direct the\nlearned imitator to have a regard to the mode of nature and manners, and\nthence draw his expressions to the life. Sometimes a play, that is\nshowy with common-places, and where the manners are well marked, though\nof no elegance, without force or art, gives the people much higher\ndelight and more effectually commands their attention, than verse void\nof matter, and tuneful trifles.",
        "To the Greeks, covetous of nothing but praise, the muse gave genius; to\nthe Greeks the power of expressing themselves in round periods. The\nRoman youth learn by long computation to subdivide a pound into an\nhundred parts. Let the son of Albinus tell me, if from five ounces one\nbe subtracted, what remains? He would have said the third of a\npound.–Bravely done! you will be able to take care of your own affairs.\nAn ounce is added: what will that be? Half a pound. When this sordid\nrust and hankering after wealth has once tainted their minds, can we\nexpect that such verses should be made as are worthy of being anointed\nwith the oil of cedar, and kept in the well-polished cypress?",
        "Poets wish either to profit or to delight; or to deliver at once both\nthe pleasures and the necessaries of life. Whatever precepts you give,\nbe concise; that docile minds may soon comprehend what is said, and\nfaithfully retain it. All superfluous instructions flow from the too\nfull memory. Let what ever is imagined for the sake of entertainment,\nhave as much likeness to truth as possible; let not your play demand\nbelief for whatever [absurdities] it is inclinable [to exhibit]: nor\ntake out of a witch’s belly a living child that she had dined upon. The\ntribes of the seniors rail against every thing that is void of\nedification: the exalted knights disregard poems which are austere. He\nwho joins the instructive with the agreeable, carries off every vote, by\ndelighting and at the same time admonishing the reader. This book gains\nmoney for the Sosii; this crosses the sea, and continues to its renowned\nauthor a lasting duration.",
        "Yet there are faults, which we should be ready to pardon: for neither\ndoes the string [always] form the sound which the hand and conception\n[of the performer] intends, but very often returns a sharp note when he\ndemands a flat; nor will the bow always hit whatever mark it threatens.\nBut when there is a great majority of beauties in a poem, I will not be\noffended with a few blemishes, which either inattention has dropped, or\nhuman nature has not sufficiently provided against. What therefore [is\nto be determined in this matter]? As a transcriber, if he still commits\nthe same fault though he has been reproved, is without excuse; and the\nharper who always blunders on the same string, is sure to be laughed at;\nso he who is excessively deficient becomes another Choerilus; whom, when\nI find him tolerable in two or three places, I wonder at with laughter;\nand at the same time am I grieved whenever honest Homer grows drowsy?\nBut it is allowable, that sleep should steal upon [the progress of] a\nking work.",
        "As is painting, so is poetry: some pieces will strike you more if you\nstand near, and some, if you are at a greater distance: one loves the\ndark; another, which is not afraid of the critic’s subtle judgment,\nchooses to be seen in the light; the one has pleased once, the other\nwill give pleasure if ten times repeated.",
        "O ye elder of the youths, though you are framed to a right judgment by\nyour father’s instructions, and are wise in yourself, yet take this\ntruth along with you, [and] remember it; that in certain things a medium\nand tolerable degree of eminence may be admitted: a counselor and\npleader at the bar of the middle rate is far removed from the merit of\neloquent Messala, nor has so much knowledge of the law as Casselius\nAulus, but yet he is in request; [but] a mediocrity in poets neither\ngods, nor men, nor [even] the booksellers’ shops have endured. As at an\nagreeable entertainment discordant music, and muddy perfume, and poppies\nmixed with Sardinian honey give offense, because the supper might have\npassed without them; so poetry, created and invented for the delight of\nour souls, if it comes short ever so little of the summit, sinks to the\nbottom.",
        "He who does not understand the game, abstains from the weapons of the\nCampus Martius: and the unskillful in the tennis-ball, the quoit, and\nthe troques keeps himself quiet; lest the crowded ring should raise a\nlaugh at his expense: notwithstanding this, he who knows nothing of\nverses presumes to compose. Why not! He is free-born, and of a good\nfamily; above all, he is registered at an equestrian sum of moneys, and\nclear from every vice. You, [I am persuaded,] will neither say nor do\nany thing in opposition to Minerva: such is your judgment, such your\ndisposition. But if ever you shall write anything, let it be submitted\nto the ears of Metius [Tarpa], who is a judge, and your father’s, and\nmine; and let it be suppressed till the ninth year, your papers being\nheld up within your own custody. You will have it in your power to blot\nout what you have not made public: a word ice sent abroad can never\nreturn.",
        "Orpheus, the priest and Interpreter of the gods, deterred the savage\nrace of men from slaughters and inhuman diet; once said to tame tigers\nand furious lions: Amphion too, the builder of the Theban wall, was said\nto give the stones moon with the sound of his lyre, and to lead them\nwhithersover he would, by engaging persuasion. This was deemed wisdom of\nyore, to distinguish the public from private weal; things sacred from\nthings profane; to prohibit a promiscuous commerce between the sexes; to\ngive laws to married people; to plan out cities; to engrave laws on\n[tables of] wood. Thus honor accrued to divine poets, and their songs.\nAfter these, excellent Homer and Tyrtaeus animated the manly mind to\nmartial achievements with their verses. Oracles were delivered in\npoetry, and the economy of life pointed out, and the favor of sovereign\nprinces was solicited by Pierian drains, games were instituted, and a\n[cheerful] period put to the tedious labors of the day; [this I remind\nyou of,] lest haply you should be ashamed of the lyric muse, and Apollo\nthe god of song.",
        "It has been made a question, whether good poetry be derived from nature\nor from art. For my part, I can neither conceive what study can do\nwithout a rich [natural] vein, nor what rude genius can avail of itself:\nso much does the one require the assistance of the other, and so\namicably do they conspire [to produce the same effect]. He who is\nindustrious to reach the wished-for goal, has done and suffered much\nwhen a boy; he has sweated and shivered with cold; he has abstained from\nlove and wine; he who sings the Pythian strains, was a learner first,\nand in awe of a master. But [in poetry] it is now enough for a man to\nsay of himself: “I make admirable verses: a murrain seize the hindmost:\nit is scandalous for me to be outstripped, and fairly to Acknowledge\nthat I am ignorant of that which I never learned.”",
        "As a crier who collects the crowd together to buy his goods, so a poet\nrich in land, rich in money put out at interest, invites flatterers to\ncome [and praise his works] for a reward. But if he be one who is well\nable to set out an elegant table, and give security for a poor man, and\nrelieve when entangled in glaomy law-suits; I shall wonder if with his\nwealth he can distinguish a true friend from false one. You, whether\nyou have made, or intend to make, a present to any one, do not bring him\nfull of joy directly to your finished verses: for then he will cry out,\n\"Charming, excellent, judicious,” he will turn pale; at some parts he\nwill even distill the dew from his friendly eyes; he will jump about; he\nwill beat the ground [with ecstasy]. As those who mourn at funerals for\npay, do and say more than those that are afflicted from their hearts; so\nthe sham admirer is more moved than he that praises with sincerity.\nCertain kings are said to ply with frequent bumpers, and by wine make\ntrial of a man whom they are sedulous to know whether he be worthy of\ntheir friendship or not. Thus, if you compose verses, let not the fox’s\nconcealed intentions impose upon you.",
        "If you had recited any thing to Quintilius, he would say, “Alter, I\npray, this and this:” if you replied, you could do it no better, having\nmade the experiment twice or thrice in vain; he would order you to blot\nout, and once more apply to the anvil your ill-formed verses: if you\nchoose rather to defend than correct a fault, he spent not a word more\nnor fruitless labor, but you alone might be fond of yourself and your\nown works, without a rival. A good and sensible man will censure\nspiritless verses, he will condemn the rugged, on the incorrect he will\ndraw across a black stroke with his pen; he will lop off ambitious [and\nredundant] ornaments; he will make him throw light on the parts that are\nnot perspicuous; he will arraign what is expressed ambiguously; he will\nmark what should be altered; [in short,] he will be an Aristarchus: he\nwill not say, “Why should I give my friend offense about mere trifles?\"\nThese trifles will lead into mischiefs of serious consequence, when once\nmade an object of ridicule, and used in a sinister manner.",
        "Like one whom an odious plague or jaundice, fanatic phrensy or lunacy,\ndistresses; those who are wise avoid a mad poet, and are afraid to touch\nhim; the boys jostle him, and the incautious pursue him. If, like a\nfowler intent upon his game, he should fall into a well or a ditch while\nhe belches out his fustian verses and roams about, though he should cry\nout for a long time, “Come to my assistance, O my countrymen;” not one\nwould give himself the trouble of taking him up. Were any one to take\npains to give him aid, and let down a rope; “How do you know, but he\nthrew himself in hither on purpose?” I shall say: and will relate the\ndeath of the Sicilian poet. Empedocles, while he was ambitious of being\nesteemed an immortal god, in cold blood leaped into burning Aetna. Let\npoets have the privilege and license to die [as they please]. He who\nsaves a man against his will, does the same with him who kills him\n[against his will]. Neither is it the first time that he has behaved in\nthis manner; nor, were he to be forced from his purposes, would he now\nbecome a man, and lay aside his desire of such a famous death. Neither\ndoes it appear sufficiently, why he makes verses: whether he has defiled\nhis father’s ashes, or sacrilegiously removed the sad enclosure of the\nvindictive thunder: it is evident that he is mad, and like a bear that\nhas burst through the gates closing his den, this unmerciful rehearser\nchases the learned and unlearned. And whomsoever he seizes, he fastens\non and assassinates with recitation: a leech that will not quit the\nskin, till satiated with blood.",
