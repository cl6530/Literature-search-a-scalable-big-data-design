        "\n\n",
        "The most famous king that Scotland ever had was Robert Bruce.  He\nlived in the days when Edward I, Edward II, and Edward III were\nkings of England.",
        "During the reign of Edward I the king of Scotland died and thirteen\nmen claimed the throne.  Instead of fighting to decide which of them\nshould be king they asked Edward to settle the question.  When he\nmet the Scottish nobles and the rivals, each of whom thought that\nnext day he would be wearing the crown, Edward told them that he\nwould himself be their king.  Just then an English army marched\nup.  What could the nobles do but kneel at the feet of Edward and\npromise to be his vassals?  This they did; and so Scotland became\na part of Edward’s kingdom and Baliol (Ba’-li-ol), one of the rivals\nwho claimed the Scottish throne, was made the vassal king.",
        "Some time after this Edward ordered Baliol to raise an army and\nhelp him fight the French.  Baliol refused to do this, so Edward\nmarched with an army into Scotland and took him prisoner.  He was\ndetermined that the Scotch should have no more kings of their own.\nSo he carried away the sacred stone of Scone (scoon), on which all\nkings of Scotland had to sit when they were crowned, and put it in\nWestminster Abbey in London, and there it is to this day.  [NOTE\nFROM Brett Fishburne:  As of 1994, the stone is in Edinburgh\nCastle.]  It is underneath the chair on which the sovereigns of\nEngland always sit when the crown of England, Scotland, and Ireland\nis placed upon their heads.  It is said to have been the very\nstone that Jacob used for a pillow on the night that he saw, in his\ndream, angels ascending and descending on the ladder that reached\nfrom earth to heaven.",
        "Edward now supposed, as he had this sacred stone and had put King\nBaliol in prison, that Scotland was conquered.",
        "But the men whom he appointed to govern the Scotch ruled unwisely\nand nearly all the people were discontented.  Suddenly an army of\nScots was raised.  It was led by Sir William Wallace, a knight who\nwas almost a giant in size.  Wallace’s men drove the English out\nof the country and Wallace was made the “Guardian of the Realm.”",
        "Edward then led a great army against him.  The Scottish soldiers were\nnearly all on foot.  Wallace arranged them in hollow squares—spearmen\non the outside, bowmen within.  The English horsemen dashed vainly\nagainst the walls of spear-points.  But King Edward now brought\nhis archers to the front.  Thousands of arrows flew from their bows\nand thousands of Wallace’s men fell dead.  The spears were broken\nand the Scotch were defeated.  Wallace barely escaped with his life.\nHe was afterwards betrayed to Edward, who cruelly put him to death.",
        "But the Scotch had learned what they could do and they still went\non fighting for freedom, under two leaders named Robert Bruce and\nJohn Comyn.  Edward marched against them with another large army.\nHe won a great victory, and the nobles once more swore to obey him.",
        "But in spite of this oath, Bruce meant to free Scotland if he could,\nand win the crown.  He was privately crowned king of Scotland in\nthe Abbey of Scone in 1306.",
        "He said to his wife, “Henceforth you are the queen and I am the\nking of our country.”",
        "“I fear,” said his wife, “that we are only playing at being king\nand queen, like children in their games.”",
        "“Nay, I shall be king in earnest,” said Bruce.",
        "The news that Bruce had been crowned roused all Scotland and the\npeople took up arms to fight under him against the English.  But\nagain King Edward defeated the Scotch and Bruce himself fled to\nthe Grampian Hills.",
        "For two months he was closely pursued by the English who used\nbloodhounds to track him.  He and his followers had many narrow\nescapes.  Once he had to scramble barefoot up some steep rocks, and\nanother time all the party would have been captured had not Bruce\nawakened just in time to hear the approach of the enemy.  He and\nhis men lived by hunting and fishing.",
        "However, many brave patriots joined them, until after a while Bruce\nhad a small army.  Five times he attacked the English, and five\ntimes he was beaten.  After his last defeat he fled from Scotland\nand took refuge in a wretched hut on an island off the north coast\nof Ireland.  Here he stayed all alone during one winter.",
        "It is said that one day, while he was very down-hearted, he saw\na spider trying to spin a web between two beams of his hut.  The\nlittle creature tried to throw a thread from one beam to another,\nbut failed.  Not discouraged, it tried four times more without\nsuccess.",
        "“Five times has the spider failed,” said Bruce.  “That is just the\nnumber of times the English have defeated me.  If the spider has\ncourage to try again, I also will try to free Scotland!”",
        "He watched the spider.  It rested for a while as if to gain strength,\nand then threw its slender thread toward the beam.  This time it\nsucceeded.",
        "“I thank God!” exclaimed Bruce.  “The spider has taught me a lesson.\nNo more will I be discouraged.”",
        "About this time Edward I died and his son, Edward II, succeeded\nto the throne of England.  For about two years the new king paid\nlittle attention to Scotland.",
        "Meantime Bruce captured nearly all the Scotch castles that were held\nby the English, and the nobles and chiefs throughout the country\nacknowledged him as their king.",
        "At last Edward II marched into Scotland at the head of a hundred\nthousand men.  Bruce met him at Bannockburn on June 24, 1314, with\nthirty thousand soldiers.",
        "Before the battle began Bruce rode along the front of his army to\nencourage his men.  Suddenly an English knight, Henry de Bohun,\ngalloped across the field and tried to strike him down with\na spear.  Bruce saw his danger in time and with a quick stroke of\nhis battle-axe cleft the knight’s skull.",
        "The Scotch army shouted again and again at this feat of their\ncommander, and they went into the battle feeling sure that the\nvictory would be theirs.  They rushed upon the English with fury\nand although outnumbered three to one, completely defeated them.\nThousands of the English were slain and a great number captured.",
        "In spite of this terrible blow Edward never gave up his claim to\nthe Scottish crown.  But his son Edward III, in 1328, recognized\nScotland’s independence and acknowledged Bruce as her king.",
