        "It is a curious fact that of that class of literature to which\nMunchausen belongs, that namely of Voyages Imaginaires, the three\ngreat types should have all been created in England. Utopia, Robinson\nCrusoe, and Gulliver, illustrating respectively the philosophical, the\nedifying, and the satirical type of fictitious travel, were all\nwritten in England, and at the end of the eighteenth century a fourth\ntype, the fantastically mendacious, was evolved in this country. Of\nthis type Munchausen was the modern original, and remains the\nclassical example. The adaptability of such a species of composition\nto local and topical uses might well be considered prejudicial to its\nchances of obtaining a permanent place in literature. Yet Munchausen\nhas undoubtedly achieved such a place. The Baron’s notoriety is\nuniversal, his character proverbial, and his name as familiar as that\nof Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, or Robinson Crusoe, mariner, of York.\nCondemned by the learned, like some other masterpieces, as worthless,\nMunchausen’s travels have obtained such a world-wide fame, that the\nstory of their origin possesses a general and historic interest apart\nfrom whatever of obscurity or of curiosity it may have to recommend\nit.",
        "The work first appeared in London in the course of the year 1785. No\ncopy of the first edition appears to be accessible; it seems, however,\nto have been issued some time in the autumn, and in the Critical\nReview for December 1785 there is the following notice: “Baron\nMunchausen’s Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in\nRussia. Small 8vo, IS. (Smith). This is a satirical production\ncalculated to throw ridicule on the bold assertions of some\nparliamentary declaimers. If rant may be best foiled at its own\nweapons, the author’s design is not ill-founded; for the marvellous\nhas never been carried to a more whimsical and ludicrous extent.” The\nreviewer had probably read the work through from one paper cover to\nthe other. It was in fact too short to bore the most blasé of his\nkind, consisting of but forty-nine small octavo pages. The second\nedition, which is in the British Museum, bears the following title;\n\"Baron Munchausen’s Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns\nin Russia; humbly dedicated and recommended to country gentlemen, and\nif they please to be repeated as their own after a hunt, at horse\nraces, in watering places, and other such polite assemblies; round the\nbottle and fireside. Smith. Printed at Oxford. 1786.” The fact that\nthis little pamphlet again consists of but forty-nine small octavo\npages, combined with the similarity of title (as far as that of the\nfirst edition is given in the Critical Review), publisher, and\nprice, affords a strong presumption that it was identical with the\nfirst edition. This edition contains only chapters ii., iii., iv., v.,\nand vi. (pp. 10-44) of the present reprint. These chapters are the\nbest in the book and their substantial if peculiar merit can hardly be\ndenied, but the pamphlet appears to have met with little success, and\nearly in 1786 Smith seems to have sold the property to another\nbookseller, Kearsley. Kearsley had it enlarged, but not, we are\nexpressly informed, in the preface to the seventh edition, by the hand\nof the original author (who happened to be in Cornwall at the time).\nHe also had it illustrated and brought it out in the same year in book\nform at the enhanced price of two shillings, under the title:\n\"Gulliver Reviv’d: The Singular Travels, Campaigns, Voyages and\nSporting Adventures of Baron Munnikhouson commonly pronounced\nMunchausen; as he relates them over a bottle when surrounded by his\nfriends. A new edition considerably enlarged with views from the\nBaron’s drawings. London. 1786.” A well-informed Critical Reviewer\nwould have amended the title thus: “Lucian reviv’d: or Gulliver Beat\nwith his own Bow.”",
        "Four editions now succeeded each other with rapidity and without\nmodification. A German translation appeared in 1786 with the imprint\nLondon: it was, however, in reality printed by Dieterich at Göttingen.\nIt was a free rendering of the fifth edition, the preface being a\nclumsy combination of that prefixed to the original edition with that\nwhich Kearsley had added to the third.",
        "The fifth edition (which is, with the exception of trifling\ndifferences on the title-page, identical with the third, fourth, and\nsixth) is also that which has been followed in the present reprint\ndown to the conclusion of chapter twenty, where it ends with the words\n\"the great quadrangle.” The supplement treating of Munchausen’s\nextraordinary flight on the back of an eagle over France to Gibraltar,\nSouth and North America, the Polar Regions, and back to England is\nderived from the seventh edition of 1793, which has a new sub-title:–\n\"Gulliver reviv’d, or the Vice of Lying properly exposed.” The preface\nto this enlarged edition also informs the reader that the last four\neditions had met with extraordinary success, and that the\nsupplementary chapters, all, that is, with the exception of chapters\nii., iii., iv., v., and vi., which are ascribed to Baron Munchausen\nhimself, were the production of another pen, written, however, in the\nBaron’s manner. To the same ingenious person the public was indebted\nfor the engravings with which the book was embellished. The seventh\nwas the last edition by which the classic text of Munchausen was\nseriously modified. Even before this important consummation had been\narrived at, a sequel, which was within a fraction as long as the\noriginal work (it occupies pp. 163-299 of this volume), had appeared\nunder the title, “A Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen.\n. . . Humbly dedicated to Mr. Bruce the Abyssinian traveller, as the\nBaron conceives that it may be some service to him, previous to his\nmaking another journey into Abyssinia. But if this advice does not\ndelight Mr. Bruce, the Baron is willing to fight him on any terms he\npleases.” This work was issued separately. London, 1792, 8vo.",
        "Such is the history of the book during the first eight or constructive\nyears of its existence, beyond which it is necessary to trace it,\nuntil at least we have touched upon the long-vexed question of its\nauthorship.",
        "Munchausen’s travels have in fact been ascribed to as many different\nhands as those of Odysseus. But (as in most other respects) it differs\nfrom the more ancient fabulous narrative in that its authorship has\nbeen the subject of but little controversy. Many people have\nentertained erroneous notions as to its authorship, which they have\ncirculated with complete assurance; but they have not felt it\nincumbent upon them to support their own views or to combat those of\nother people. It has, moreover, been frequently stated with equal\nconfidence and inaccuracy that the authorship has never been settled.\nAn early and persistent version of the genesis of the travels was that\nthey took their origin from the rivalry in fabulous tales of three\naccomplished students at Göttingen University, Bürger, Kästner, and\nLichtenberg; another ran that Gottfried August Bürger, the German poet\nand author of “Lenore,” had at a later stage of his career met Baron\nMunchausen in Pyrmont and taken down the stories from his own lips.\nPercy in his anecdotes attributes the Travels to a certain Mr. M.\n(Munchausen also began with an M.) who was imprisoned at Paris during\nthe Reign of Terror. Southey in his “Omniana” conjectured, from the\ncoincidences between two of the tales and two in a Portuguese\nperiodical published in 1730, that the English fictions must have been\nderived from the Portuguese. William West the bookseller and numerous\nfollowers have stated that Munchausen owed its first origin to Bruce’s\nTravels, and was written for the purpose of burlesquing that unfairly\ntreated work. Pierer boldly stated that it was a successful anonymous\nsatire upon the English government of the day, while Meusel with equal\ntemerity affirmed in his “Lexikon” that the book was a translation of\nthe “well-known Munchausen lies” executed from a (non-existent) German\noriginal by Rudolph Erich Raspe. A writer in the Gentleman’s\nMagazine for 1856 calls the book the joint production of Bürger and\nRaspe.",
        "Of all the conjectures, of which these are but a selection, the most\naccurate from a German point of view is that the book was the work of\nBürger, who was the first to dress the Travels in a German garb, and\nwas for a long time almost universally credited with the sole\nproprietorship. Bürger himself appears neither to have claimed nor\ndisclaimed the distinction. There is, however, no doubt whatever that\nthe book first appeared in English in 1785, and that Bürger’s German\nversion did not see the light until 1786. The first German edition\n(though in reality printed at Göttingen) bore the imprint London, and\nwas stated to be derived from an English source; but this was,\nreasonably enough, held to be merely a measure of precaution in case\nthe actual Baron Munchausen (who was a well-known personage in\nGöttingen) should be stupid enough to feel aggrieved at being made the\nbutt of a gross caricature. In this way the discrepancy of dates\nmentioned above might easily have been obscured, and Bürger might\nstill have been credited with a work which has proved a better\nprotection against oblivion than “Lenore,” had it not been for the\nofficious sensitiveness of his self-appointed biographer, Karl von\nReinhard. Reinhard, in an answer to an attack made upon his hero for\nbringing out Munchausen as a pot-boiler in German and English\nsimultaneously, definitely stated in the Berlin Gesellschafters of\nNovember 1824, that the real author of the original work was that\ndisreputable genius, Rudolph Erich Raspe, and that the German work was\nmerely a free translation made by Bürger from the fifth edition of the\nEnglish work. Bürger, he stated, was well aware of, but was too high-\nminded to disclose the real authorship.",
        "Taking Reinhard’s solemn asseveration in conjunction with the\nascertained facts of Raspe’s career, his undoubted acquaintance with\nthe Baron Munchausen of real life and the first appearance of the work\nin 1785, when Raspe was certainly in England, there seems to be little\ndifficulty in accepting his authorship as a positive fact. There is no\ndifficulty whatever, in crediting Raspe with a sufficient mastery of\nEnglish idiom to have written the book without assistance, for as\nearly as January 1780 (since which date Raspe had resided\nuninterruptedly in this country) Walpole wrote to his friend Mason\nthat “Raspe writes English much above ill and speaks it as readily as\nFrench,” and shortly afterwards he remarked that he wrote English\n\"surprisingly well.” In the next year, 1781, Raspe’s absolute command\nof the two languages encouraged him to publish two moderately good\nprose-translations, one of Lessing’s “Nathan the Wise,” and the other\nof Zachariae’s Mock-heroic, “Tabby in Elysium.” The erratic character\nof the punctuation may be said, with perfect impartiality, to be the\nonly distinguishing feature of the style of the original edition of\n\"Munchausen.”",
        "Curious as is this long history of literary misappropriation, the\nchequered career of the rightful author, Rudolph Erich Raspe, offers a\nchapter in biography which has quite as many points of singularity.",
        "Born in Hanover in 1737, Raspe studied at the Universities of\nGöttingen and Leipsic. He is stated also to have rendered some\nassistance to a young nobleman in sowing his wild oats, a sequel to\nhis university course which may possibly help to explain his\nsubsequent aberrations. The connection cannot have lasted long, as in\n1762, having already obtained reputation as a student of natural\nhistory and antiquities, he obtained a post as one of the clerks in\nthe University Library at Hanover.",
        "No later than the following year contributions written in elegant\nLatin are to be found attached to his name in the Leipsic Nova Acta\nEruditorum. In 1764 he alluded gracefully to the connection between\nHanover and England in a piece upon the birthday of Queen Charlotte,\nand having been promoted secretary of the University Library at\nGöttingen, the young savant commenced a translation of Leibniz’s\nphilosophical works which was issued in Latin and French after the\noriginal MSS. in the Royal Library at Hanover, with a preface by\nRaspe’s old college friend Kästner (Göttingen, 1765). At once a\ncourtier, an antiquary, and a philosopher, Raspe next sought to\ndisplay his vocation for polite letters, by publishing an ambitious\nallegorical poem of the age of chivalry, entitled “Hermin and\nGunilde,” which was not only exceedingly well reviewed, but received\nthe honour of a parody entitled “Harlequin and Columbine.” He also\nwrote translations of several of the poems of Ossian, and a\ndisquisition upon their genuineness; and then with better inspiration\nhe wrote a considerable treatise on “Percy’s Reliques of Ancient\nPoetry,” with metrical translations, being thus the first to call the\nattention of Germany to these admirable poems, which were afterwards\nso successfully ransacked by Bürger, Herder, and other early German\nromanticists.",
        "In 1767 Raspe was again advanced by being appointed Professor at the\nCollegium Carolinum in Cassel, and keeper of the landgrave of Hesse’s\nrich and curious collection of antique gems and medals. He was shortly\nafterwards appointed Librarian in the same city, and in 1771 he\nmarried. He continued writing on natural history, mineralogy, and\narchæology, and in 1769 a paper in the 59th volume of the\nPhilosophical Transactions, on the bones and teeth of elephants and\nother animals found in North America and various boreal regions of the\nworld, procured his election as an honorary member of the Royal\nSociety of London. His conclusion in this paper that large elephants\nor mammoths must have previously existed in boreal regions has, of\ncourse, been abundantly justified by later investigations. When it is\nadded that Raspe during this part of his life also wrote papers on\nlithography and upon musical instruments, and translated Algarotti’s\nTreatise on “Architecture, Painting, and Opera Music,” enough will\nhave been said to make manifest his very remarkable and somewhat\nprolix versatility. In 1773 he made a tour in Westphalia in quest of\nMSS., and on his return, by way of completing his education, he turned\njournalist, and commenced a periodical called the Cassel Spectator,\nwith Mauvillon as his co-editor. In 1775 he was travelling in Italy on\na commission to collect articles of vertu for the landgrave, and it\nwas apparently soon after his return that he began appropriating to\nhis own use valuable coins abstracted from the cabinets entrusted to\nhis care. He had no difficulty in finding a market for the antiques\nwhich he wished to dispose of, and which, it has been charitably\nsuggested, he had every intention of replacing whenever opportunity\nshould serve. His consequent procedure was, it is true, scarcely that\nof a hardened criminal. Having obtained the permission of the\nlandgrave to visit Berlin, he sent the keys of his cabinet back to the\nauthorities at Cassel–and disappeared. His thefts, to the amount of\ntwo thousand rixdollars, were promptly discovered, and advertisements\nwere issued for the arrest of the Councillor Raspe, described without\nsuspicion of flattery as a long-faced man, with small eyes, crooked\nnose, red hair under a stumpy periwig, and a jerky gait. The\nnecessities that prompted him to commit a felony are possibly\nindicated by the addition that he usually appeared in a scarlet dress\nembroidered with gold, but sometimes in black, blue, or grey clothes.\nHe was seized when he had got no farther than Klausthal, in the Hartz\nmountains, but he lost no time in escaping from the clutches of the\npolice, and made his way to England. He never again set foot on the\ncontinent.",
        "He was already an excellent English scholar, so that when he reached\nLondon it was not unnatural that he should look to authorship for\nsupport. Without loss of time, he published in London in 1776 a volume\non some German Volcanoes and their productions; in 1777 he translated\nthe then highly esteemed mineralogical travels of Ferber in Italy and\nHungary. In 1780 we have an interesting account of him from Horace\nWalpole, who wrote to his friend, the Rev. William Mason: “There is a\nDutch sçavant come over who is author of several pieces so learned\nthat I do not even know their titles: but he has made a discovery in\nmy way which you may be sure I believe, for it proves what I expected\nand hinted in my ’Anecdotes of Painting,’ that the use of oil colours\nwas known long before Van Eyck.” Raspe, he went on to say, had\ndiscovered a MS. of Theophilus, a German monk in the fourth century,\nwho gave receipts for preparing the colours, and had thereby convicted\nVasari of error. “Raspe is poor, and I shall try and get subscriptions\nto enable him to print his work, which is sensible, clear, and\nunpretending.” Three months later it was, “Poor Raspe is arrested by\nhis tailor. I have sent him a little money, and he hopes to recover\nhis liberty, but I question whether he will be able to struggle on\nhere.” His “Essay on the Origin of Oil Painting” was actually\npublished through Walpole’s good service in April 1781. He seems to\nhave had plans of going to America and of excavating antiquities in\nEgypt, where he might have done good service, but the bad name that he\nhad earned dogged him to London. The Royal Society struck him off its\nrolls, and in revenge he is said to have threatened to publish a\ntravesty of their transactions. He was doubtless often hard put to it\nfor a living, but the variety of his attainments served him in good\nstead. He possessed or gained some reputation as a mining expert, and\nmaking his way down into Cornwall, he seems for some years subsequent\nto 1782 to have been assay-master and storekeeper of some mines at\nDolcoath. While still at Dolcoath, it is very probable that he put\ntogether the little pamphlet which appeared in London at the close of\n1785, with the title “Baron Munchausen’s Narrative of his Marvellous\nTravels and Campaigns in Russia,” and having given his jeu d’esprit\nto the world, and possibly earned a few guineas by it, it is not\nlikely that he gave much further thought to the matter. In the course\nof 1785 or 1786, he entered upon a task of much greater magnitude and\nimmediate importance, namely, a descriptive catalogue of the\nCollection of Pastes and Impressions from Ancient and Modern Gems,\nformed by James Tassie, the eminent connoisseur. Tassie engaged Raspe\nin 1785 to take charge of his cabinets, and to commence describing\ntheir contents: he can hardly have been ignorant of his employé’s\ndelinquencies in the past, but he probably estimated that mere casts\nof gems would not offer sufficient temptation to a man of Raspe’s\neclectic tastes to make the experiment a dangerous one. Early in 1786,\nRaspe produced a brief but well-executed conspectus of the arrangement\nand classification of the collection, and this was followed in 1791 by\n\"A Descriptive Catalogue,” in which over fifteen thousand casts of\nancient and modern engraved gems, cameos, and intaglios from the most\nrenowned cabinets in Europe were enumerated and described in French\nand English. The two quarto volumes are a monument of patient and\nhighly skilled industry, and they still fetch high prices. The\nelaborate introduction prefixed to the work was dated from Edinburgh,\nApril 16, 1790.",
        "This laborious task completed, Raspe lost no time in applying himself\nwith renewed energy to mineralogical work. It was announced in the\nScots Magazine for October 1791 that he had discovered in the\nextreme north of Scotland, where he had been invited to search for\nminerals, copper, lead, iron, manganese, and other valuable products\nof a similar character. From Sutherland he brought specimens of the\nfinest clay, and reported a fine vein of heavy spar and “every symptom\nof coal.” But in Caithness lay the loadstone which had brought Raspe\nto Scotland. This was no other than Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster, a\nbenevolent gentleman of an ingenious and inquiring disposition, who\nwas anxious to exploit the supposed mineral wealth of his barren\nScottish possessions. With him Raspe took up his abode for a\nconsiderable time at his spray-beaten castle on the Pentland Firth,\nand there is a tradition, among members of the family, of Sir John’s\nunfailing appreciation of the wide intelligence and facetious humour\nof Raspe’s conversation. Sinclair had some years previously discovered\na small vein of yellow mundick on the moor of Skinnet, four miles from\nThurso. The Cornish miners he consulted told him that the mundick was\nitself of no value, but a good sign of the proximity of other valuable\nminerals. Mundick, said they, was a good horseman, and always rode on\na good load. He now employed Raspe to examine the ground, not\ndesigning to mine it himself, but to let it out to other capitalists\nin return for a royalty, should the investigation justify his hopes.\nThe necessary funds were put at Raspe’s disposal, and masses of\nbright, heavy material were brought to Thurso Castle as a foretaste of\nwhat was coming. But when the time came for the fruition of this\ngolden promise, Raspe disappeared, and subsequent inquiries revealed\nthe deplorable fact that these opulent ores had been carefully\nimported by the mining expert from Cornwall, and planted in the places\nwhere they were found. Sir Walter Scott must have had the incident\n(though not Raspe) in his mind when he created the Dousterswivel of\nhis “Antiquary.” As for Raspe, he betook himself to a remote part of\nthe United Kingdom, and had commenced some mining operations in\ncountry Donegal, when he was carried off by scarlet fever at Muckross\nin 1794. Such in brief outline was the career of Rudolph Erich Raspe,\nscholar, swindler, and undoubted creator of Baron Munchausen.",
        "The merit of Munchausen, as the adult reader will readily perceive,\ndoes not reside in its literary style, for Raspe is no exception to\nthe rule that a man never has a style worthy of the name in a language\nthat he did not prattle in. But it is equally obvious that the real\nand original Munchausen, as Raspe conceived and doubtless intended at\none time to develop him, was a delightful personage whom it would be\nthe height of absurdity to designate a mere liar. Unfortunately the\ntask was taken out of his hand and a good character spoiled, like many\nanother, by mere sequel-mongers. Raspe was an impudent scoundrel, and\nfortunately so; his impudence relieves us of any difficulty in\nresolving the question,–to whom (if any one) did he owe the original\nconception of the character whose fame is now so universal.",
        "When Raspe was resident in Göttingen he obtained, in all probability\nthrough Gerlach Adolph von Munchausen, the great patron of arts and\nletters and of Göttingen University, an introduction to Hieronynimus\nKarl Friedrich von Munchausen, at whose hospitable mansion at\nBodenwerder he became an occasional visitor. Hieronynimus, who was\nborn at Bodenwerder on May 11, 1720, was a cadet of what was known as\nthe black line of the house of Rinteln Bodenwerder, and in his youth\nserved as a page in the service of Prince Anton Ulrich of Brunswick.\nWhen quite a stripling he obtained a cornetcy in the “Brunswick\nRegiment” in the Russian service, and on November 27, 1740, he was\ncreated a lieutenant by letters patent of the Empress Anna, and served\ntwo arduous campaigns against the Turks during the following years. In\n1750 he was promoted to be a captain of cuirassiers by the Empress\nElizabeth, and about 1760 he retired from the Russian service to live\nupon his patrimonial estate at Bodenwerder in the congenial society of\nhis wife and his paragon among huntsmen, Rösemeyer, for whose\nparticular benefit he maintained a fine pack of hounds. He kept open\nhouse, and loved to divert his guests with stories, not in the\nbraggart vein of Dugald Dalgetty, but so embellished with palpably\nextravagant lies as to crack with a humour that was all their own. The\nmanner has been appropriated by Artemus Ward and Mark Twain, but it\nwas invented by Munchausen. Now the stories mainly relate to sporting\nadventures, and it has been asserted by one contemporary of the baron\nthat Munchausen contracted the habit of drawing such a long-bow as a\nmeasure of self-defence against his invaluable but loquacious\nhenchman, the worthy Rösemeyer. But it is more probable, as is hinted\nin the first preface, that Munchausen, being a shrewd man, found the\npractice a sovereign specific against bores and all other kinds of\nserious or irrelevant people, while it naturally endeared him to the\nfriends of whom he had no small number.",
        "He told his stories with imperturbable sang froid, in a dry manner,\nand with perfect naturalness and simplicity. He spoke as a man of the\nworld, without circumlocution; his adventures were numerous and\nperhaps singular, but only such as might have been expected to happen\nto a man of so much experience. A smile never traversed his face as he\nrelated the least credible of his tales, which the less intimate of\nhis acquaintance began in time to think he meant to be taken\nseriously. In short, so strangely entertaining were both manner and\nmatter of his narratives, that “Munchausen’s Stories” became a by-word\namong a host of appreciative acquaintance. Among these was Raspe, who\nyears afterwards, when he was starving in London, bethought himself of\nthe incomparable baron. He half remembered some of his sporting\nstories, and supplemented these by gleanings from his own commonplace\nbook. The result is a curious medley, which testifies clearly to\nlearning and wit, and also to the turning over of musty old books of\nfacetiæ written in execrable Latin.",
        "  The story of the Baron’s horse being cut in two by the descending\n  portcullis of a besieged town, and the horseman’s innocence of the\n  fact until, upon reaching a fountain in the midst of the city, the\n  insatiate thirst of the animal betrayed his deficiency in hind\n  quarters, was probably derived by Raspe from the Facetiæ\n  Bebelianæ of Heinrich Bebel, first published at Strassburgh in\n  1508.",
        "  There it is given as follows: “De Insigni Mendacio. Faber\n  clavicularius quem superius fabrum mendaciorum dixi, narravit se\n  tempore belli, credens suos se subsecuturos equitando ad cujusdam\n  oppidi portas penetrasse: et cum ad portas venisset cataractam\n  turre demissam, equum suum post ephippium discidisse,\n  dimidiatumque reliquisse, atque se media parte equi ad forum usque\n  oppidi equitasse, et caedem non modicam peregisse. Sed cum\n  retrocedere vellet multitudine hostium obrutus, tum demum equum\n  cecidisse seque captum fuisse.”",
        "  The drinking at the fountain was probably an embellishment of\n  Raspe’s own. Many of Bebel’s jests were repeated in J. P. Lange’s\n  Delici Academic (Heilbronn, 1665), a section of which was\n  expressly devoted to “Mendacia Ridicula\"; but the yarn itself is\n  probably much older than either. Similarly, the quaint legend of\n  the thawing of the horn was told by Castiglione in his\n  Cortegiano, first published in 1528. This is how Castiglione\n  tells it: A merchant of Lucca had travelled to Poland in order to\n  buy furs; but as there was at that time a war with Muscovy, from\n  which country the furs were procured, the Lucchese merchant was\n  directed to the confines of the two countries. On reaching the\n  Borysthenes, which divided Poland and Muscovy, he found that the\n  Muscovite traders remained on their own side of the river from\n  distrust, on account of the state of hostilities. The Muscovites,\n  desirous of being heard across the river announced the prices of\n  their furs in a loud voice; but the cold was so intense that their\n  words were frozen in the air before they could reach the opposite\n  side. Hereupon the Poles lighted a fire in the middle of the\n  river, which was frozen into a solid mass; and in the course of an\n  hour the words which had been frozen up were melted, and fell\n  gently upon the further bank, although the Muscovite traders had\n  already gone away. The prices demanded were, however, so high that\n  the Lucchese merchant returned without making any purchase. A\n  similar idea is utilised by Rabelais in Pantagruel, and by\n  Steele in one of his Tatlers. The story of the cherry tree\n  growing out of the stag’s head, again, is given in Lange’s book,\n  and the fact that all three tales are of great antiquity is proved\n  by the appearance of counterparts to them in Lady Guest’s edition\n  of the Mabinogion. A great number of nug canor of a\n  perfectly similar type are narrated in the sixteenth century\n  “Travels of the Finkenritter” attributed to Lorenz von Lauterbach.",
        "To humorous waifs of this description, without fixed origin or\nbirthplace, did Raspe give a classical setting amongst embroidered\nversions of the baron’s sporting jokes. The unscrupulous manner in\nwhich he affixed Munchausen’s own name to the completed jeu d’esprit\nis, ethically speaking, the least pardonable of his crimes; for when\nRaspe’s little book was first transformed and enlarged, and then\ntranslated into German, the genial old baron found himself the victim\nof an unmerciful caricature, and without a rag of concealment. It is\nconsequently not surprising to hear that he became soured and reticent\nbefore his death at Bodenwerder in 1797.",
        "Strangers had already begun to come down to the place in the hope of\ngetting a glimpse of the eccentric nobleman, and foolish stories were\ntold of his thundering out his lies with apoplectic visage, his eyes\nstarting out of his head, and perspiration beading his forehead. The\nfountain of his reminiscences was in reality quite dried up, and it\nmust be admitted that this excellent old man had only too good reason\nto consider himself an injured person.",
        "In this way, then, came to be written the first delightful chapters of\nBaron Munchausen’s “Narrative of his Travels and Campaigns in Russia.\"\nIt was not primarily intended as a satire, nor was it specially\ndesigned to take of the extravagant flights of contemporary\ntravellers. It was rather a literary frivolity, thrown off at one\neffort by a tatterdemalion genius in sore need of a few guineas.",
        "The remainder of the book is a melancholy example of the fallacy of\nenlargements and of sequels. Neither Raspe nor the baron can be\nseriously held responsible for a single word of it. It must have been\nwritten by a bookseller’s hack, whom it is now quite impossible to\nidentify, but who was evidently of native origin; and the book is a\ncharacteristically English product, full of personal and political\nsatire, with just a twang of edification. The first continuation\n(chapters one and seven, to twenty, inclusive), which was supplied\nwith the third edition, is merely a modern rechauffé, with “up to\ndate” allusions, of Lucian’s Vera Historia. Prototypes of the\nmajority of the stories may either be found in Lucian or in the twenty\nvolumes of Voyages Imaginaires, published at Paris in 1787. In case,\nhowever, any reader should be sceptical as to the accuracy of this\nstatement he will have no very great difficulty in supposing, as Dr.\nJohnson supposed of Ossian, that anybody could write a great amount of\nsuch stuff if he would only consent to abandon his mind to the task.",
        "With the supplementary chapters commence topical allusions to the\nrecently issued memoirs of Baron de Tott, an enterprising Frenchman\nwho had served the Great Turk against the Russians in the Crimea (an\nEnglish translation of his book had appeared in 1785). The satire upon\nthis gallant soldier’s veracity appears to be quite undeserved, though\none can hardly read portions of his adventures without being forcibly\nreminded of the Baron’s laconic style. It is needless to add that the\namazing account of De Tott’s origin is grossly libellous. The amount\nof public interest excited by the æronautical exploits of Montgolfier\nand Blanchard was also playfully satirised. Their first imitator in\nEngland, Vincenzo Lunardi, had made a successful ascent from\nMoorfields as recently as 1784, while in the following year Blanchard\ncrossed the channel in a balloon and earned the sobriquet Don Quixote\nde la Manche. His grotesque appropriation of the motto “Sic itur ad\nastra” made him, at least, a fit object for Munchausen’s gibes. In\nthe Baron’s visit to Gibraltar we have evidence that the anonymous\nwriter, in common with the rest of the reading public, had been\nstudying John Drinkwater’s “History of the Siege of Gibraltar\"\n(completed in 1783), which had with extreme rapidity established its\nreputation as a military classic. Similarly, in the Polar adventures,\nthe “Voyage towards the North Pole,” 1774, of Constantine John Phipps,\nafterwards Lord Mulgrave, is gently ridiculed, and so also some\nincidents from Patrick Brydone’s “Tour through Sicily and Malta\"\n(1773), are, for no obvious reason, contemptuously dragged in. The\nexploitation of absurd and libellous chap-book lives of Pope Clement\nXIV., the famous Ganganelli, can only be described as a low bid for\nvulgar applause. A French translation of Baron Friedrich von Trenck’s\ncelebrated Memoirs appeared at Metz in 1787, and it would certainly\nseem that in overlooking them the compiler of Munchausen was guilty of\na grave omission. He may, however, have regarded Trenck’s adventures\nless as material for ridicule than as a series of hâbleries which\nthreatened to rival his own.",
        "The Seventh Edition, published in 1793, with the supplement (pp. 142-\n161), was, with the abominable proclivity to edification which marked\nthe publisher of the period (that of “Goody Two-Shoes” and “Sandford\nand Merton”), styled “Gulliver Reviv’d: or the Vice of Lying Properly\nExposed.” The previous year had witnessed the first appearance of the\nsequel, of which the full title has already been given, “with twenty\ncapital copperplates, including the baron’s portrait.” The merit of\nMunchausen as a mouthpiece for ridiculing traveller’s tall-talk, or\nindeed anything that shocked the incredulity of the age, was by this\ntime widely recognised. And hence with some little ingenuity the\npopular character was pressed into the service of the vulgar clamour\nagainst James Bruce, whose “Travels to Discover the Sources of the\nNile” had appeared in 1790. In particular Bruce’s description of the\nAbyssinian custom of feeding upon “live bulls and kava” provoked a\nchorus of incredulity. The traveller was ridiculed upon the stage as\nMacfable, and in a cloud of ephemeral productions; nor is the\nfollowing allusion in Peter Pindar obscure:–",
        " “Nor have I been where men (what loss alas!)\n  Kill half a cow, then send the rest to grass.”",
        "The way in which Bruce resented the popular scepticism is illustrated\nby the following anecdote told by Sir Francis Head, his biographer. A\ngentleman once observed, at a country house where Bruce was staying,\nthat it was not possible that the natives of Abyssinia could eat raw\nmeat! “Bruce said not a word, but leaving the room, shortly returned\nfrom the kitchen with a piece of raw beef-steak, peppered and salted\nin the Abyssinian fashion. ’You will eat that, sir, or fight me,’ he\nsaid. When the gentleman had eaten up the raw flesh (most willingly\nwould he have eaten his words instead), Bruce calmly observed, ’Now,\nsir, you will never again say it is impossible.’” In reality, Bruce\nseems to have been treated with much the same injustice as Herodotus.\nThe truth of the bulk of his narrative has been fully established,\nalthough a passion for the picturesque may certainly have led him to\nembellish many of the minor particulars. And it must be remembered,\nthat his book was not dictated until twelve years after the events\nnarrated.",
        "Apart from Bruce, however, the sequel, like the previous continuation,\ncontains a great variety of political, literary, and other allusions\nof the most purely topical character–Dr. Johnson’s Tour in the\nHebrides, Mr. Pitt, Burke’s famous pamphlet upon the French\nRevolution, Captain Cook, Tippoo Sahib (who had been brought to bay by\nLord Cornwallis between 1790 and 1792). The revolutionary pandemonium\nin Paris, and the royal flight to Varennes in June 1791, and the loss\nof the “Royal George” in 1782, all form the subjects of quizzical\ncomments, and there are many other allusions the interest of which is\nquite as ephemeral as those of a Drury Lane pantomime or a Gaiety\nBurlesque.",
        "Nevertheless the accretions have proved powerless to spoil\n\"Munchausen.” The nucleus supplied by Raspe was instinct with so much\nenergy that it has succeeded in vitalising the whole mass of\nextraneous extravagance.",
        "Although, like “Gulliver’s Travels,” “Munchausen” might at first sight\nappear to be ill-suited, in more than one respect, for the nursery,\nyet it has proved the delight of children of all ages; and there are\nprobably few, in the background of whose childish imagination the\nastonishing Munchausen has not at one time or another, together with\nRobinson Crusoe, Jack-the-Giant-Killer, and the Pied Piper of Hamelyn,\nassumed proportions at once gigantic and seductively picturesque.",
        "The work, as has been shown, assumed its final form before the close\nof the eighteenth century; with the nineteenth it commenced its\ntriumphant progress over the civilised world. Some of the subsequent\ntransformations and migrations of the book are worthy of brief record.",
        "A voluminous German continuation was published at Stendhal in three\nvolumes between 1794 and 1800. There was also a continuation\ncomprising exploits at Walcheren, the Dardanelles, Talavera, Cintra,\nand elsewhere, published in London in 1811. An elaborate French\ntranslation, with embellishments in the French manner, appeared at\nParis in 1862. Immerman’s celebrated novel entitled “Munchausen” was\npublished in four volumes at Dusseldorf in 1841, and a very free\nrendering of the Baron’s exploits, styled “Munchausen’s\nLugenabenteuer,” at Leipsic in 1846. The work has also been translated\ninto Dutch, Danish, Magyar (Bard de Mánx), Russian, Portuguese,\nSpanish (El Conde de las Maravillas), and many other tongues, and an\nestimate that over one hundred editions have appeared in England,\nGermany, and America alone, is probably rather under than above the\nmark.",
        "The book has, moreover, at the same time provided illustrations to\nwriters and orators, and the richest and most ample material for\nillustrations to artists. The original rough woodcuts are anonymous,\nbut the possibilities of the work were discovered as early as 1809, by\nThomas Rowlandson, who illustrated the edition published in that year.\nThe edition of 1859 owed embellishments to Crowquill, while Cruikshank\nsupplied some characteristic woodcuts to that of 1869. Coloured\ndesigns for the travels were executed by a French artist Richard in\n1878, and illustrations were undertaken independently for the German\neditions by Riepenhausen and Hosemann respectively. The German artist\nAdolph Schrödter has also painted a celebrated picture representing\nthe Baron surrounded by his listeners. But of all the illustrations\nyet invented, the general verdict has hitherto declared in favour of\nthose supplied to Théophile Gautier’s French edition of 1862 by\nGustave Doré, who fully maintained by them the reputation he had\ngained for work of a similar genre in his drawings for Balzac’s\nContes Drôlatiques. When, however, the public has had an opportunity\nof appreciating the admirably fantastic drawings made by Mr. William\nStrang and Mr. J. B. Clark for the present edition, they will probably\nadmit that Baron Munchausen’s indebtedness to his illustrations,\nalready very great, has been more than doubled.",
        "Baron Munnikhouson or Munchausen, of Bodenweder, near Hamelyn on the\nWeser, belongs to the noble family of that name, which gave to the\nKing’s German dominions the late prime minister and several other\npublic characters equally bright and illustrious. He is a man of great\noriginal humour; and having found that prejudiced minds cannot be\nreasoned into common sense, and that bold assertors are very apt to\nbully and speak their audience out of it, he never argues with either\nof them, but adroitly turns the conversation upon indifferent topics\nand then tells a story of his travels, campaigns, and sporting\nadventures, in a manner peculiar to himself, and well calculated to\nawaken and shame the common sense of those who have lost sight of it\nby prejudice or habit.",
        "As this method has been often attended with good success, we beg leave\nto lay some of his stories before the public, and humbly request those\nwho shall find them rather extravagant and bordering upon the\nmarvellous, which will require but a very moderate share of common\nsense, to exercise the same upon every occurrence of life, and chiefly\nupon our English politics, in which old habits and bold\nassertions, set off by eloquent speeches and supported by\nconstitutional mobs, associations, volunteers, and foreign influence,\nhave of late, we apprehend, but too successfully turned our brains,\nand made us the laughing-stock of Europe, and of France and Holland in\nparticular.",
        "Having heard, for the first time, that my adventures have been\ndoubted, and looked upon as jokes, I feel bound to come forward and\nvindicate my character for veracity, by paying three shillings at\nthe Mansion House of this great city for the affidavits hereto\nappended.",
        "This I have been forced into in regard of my own honour, although I\nhave retired for many years from public and private life; and I hope\nthat this, my last edition, will place me in a proper light with my\nreaders.",
        "At the City of London, England.",

        "Some years before my beard announced approaching manhood, or, in other\nwords, when I was neither man nor boy, but between both, I expressed\nin repeated conversations a strong desire of seeing the world, from\nwhich I was discouraged by my parents, though my father had been no\ninconsiderable traveller himself, as will appear before I have reached\nthe end of my singular, and, I may add, interesting adventures. A\ncousin, by my mother’s side, took a liking to me, often said I was\nfine forward youth, and was much inclined to gratify my curiosity. His\neloquence had more effect than mine, for my father consented to my\naccompanying him in a voyage to the island of Ceylon, where his uncle\nhad resided as governor many years.",
        "We sailed from Amsterdam with despatches from their High Mightinesses\nthe States of Holland. The only circumstance which happened on our\nvoyage worth relating was the wonderful effects of a storm, which had\ntorn up by the roots a great number of trees of enormous bulk and\nheight, in an island where we lay at anchor to take in wood and water;\nsome of these trees weighed many tons, yet they were carried by the\nwind so amazingly high, that they appeared like the feathers of small\nbirds floating in the air, for they were at least five miles above the\nearth: however, as soon as the storm subsided they all fell\nperpendicularly into their respective places, and took root again,\nexcept the largest, which happened, when it was blown into the air, to\nhave a man and his wife, a very honest old couple, upon its branches,\ngathering cucumbers (in this part of the globe that useful vegetable\ngrows upon trees): the weight of this couple, as the tree descended,\nover-balanced the trunk, and brought it down in a horizontal position:\nit fell upon the chief man of the island, and killed him on the spot;\nhe had quitted his house in the storm, under an apprehension of its\nfalling upon him, and was returning through his own garden when this\nfortunate accident happened. The word fortunate, here, requires some\nexplanation. This chief was a man of a very avaricious and oppressive\ndisposition, and though he had no family, the natives of the island\nwere half-starved by his oppressive and infamous impositions.",
        "The very goods which he had thus taken from them were spoiling in his\nstores, while the poor wretches from whom they were plundered were\npining in poverty. Though the destruction of this tyrant was\naccidental, the people chose the cucumber-gatherers for their\ngovernors, as a mark of their gratitude for destroying, though\naccidentally, their late tyrant.",
        "After we had repaired the damages we sustained in this remarkable\nstorm, and taken leave of the new governor and his lady, we sailed\nwith a fair wind for the object of our voyage.",
        "In about six weeks we arrived at Ceylon, where we were received with\ngreat marks of friendship and true politeness. The following singular\nadventures may not prove unentertaining.",
        "After we had resided at Ceylon about a fortnight I accompanied one of\nthe governor’s brothers upon a shooting party. He was a strong,\nathletic man, and being used to that climate (for he had resided there\nsome years), he bore the violent heat of the sun much better than I\ncould; in our excursion he had made a considerable progress through a\nthick wood when I was only at the entrance.",
        "Near the banks of a large piece of water, which had engaged my\nattention, I thought I heard a rustling noise behind; on turning about\nI was almost petrified (as who would not be?) at the sight of a lion,\nwhich was evidently approaching with the intention of satisfying his\nappetite with my poor carcase, and that without asking my consent.\nWhat was to be done in this horrible dilemma? I had not even a moment\nfor reflection; my piece was only charged with swan-shot, and I had no\nother about me: however, though I could have no idea of killing such\nan animal with that weak kind of ammunition, yet I had some hopes of\nfrightening him by the report, and perhaps of wounding him also. I\nimmediately let fly, without waiting till he was within reach, and the\nreport did but enrage him, for he now quickened his pace, and seemed\nto approach me full speed: I attempted to escape, but that only added\n(if an addition could be made) to my distress; for the moment I turned\nabout I found a large crocodile, with his mouth extended almost ready\nto receive me. On my right hand was the piece of water before\nmentioned, and on my left a deep precipice, said to have, as I have\nsince learned, a receptacle at the bottom for venomous creatures; in\nshort I gave myself up as lost, for the lion was now upon his hind-\nlegs, just in the act of seizing me; I fell involuntarily to the\nground with fear, and, as it afterwards appeared, he sprang over me. I\nlay some time in a situation which no language can describe, expecting\nto feel his teeth or talons in some part of me every moment: after\nwaiting in this prostrate situation a few seconds I heard a violent\nbut unusual noise, different from any sound that had ever before\nassailed my ears; nor is it at all to be wondered at, when I inform\nyou from whence it proceeded: after listening for some time, I\nventured to raise my head and look round, when, to my unspeakable joy,\nI perceived the lion had, by the eagerness with which he sprung at me,\njumped forward, as I fell, into the crocodile’s mouth! which, as\nbefore observed, was wide open; the head of the one stuck in the\nthroat of the other! and they were struggling to extricate themselves!\nI fortunately recollected my couteau de chasse, which was by my\nside; with this instrument I severed the lion’s head at one blow, and\nthe body fell at my feet! I then, with the butt-end of my fowling-\npiece, rammed the head farther into the throat of the crocodile, and\ndestroyed him by suffocation, for he could neither gorge nor eject it.",
        "Soon after I had thus gained a complete victory over my two powerful\nadversaries, my companion arrived in search of me; for finding I did\nnot follow him into the wood, he returned, apprehending I had lost my\nway, or met with some accident.",
        "After mutual congratulations, we measured the crocodile, which was\njust forty feet in length.",
        "As soon as we had related this extraordinary adventure to the\ngovernor, he sent a waggon and servants, who brought home the two\ncarcases. The lion’s skin was properly preserved, with its hair on,\nafter which it was made into tobacco-pouches, and presented by me,\nupon our return to Holland, to the burgomasters, who, in return,\nrequested my acceptance of a thousand ducats.",
        "The skin of the crocodile was stuffed in the usual manner, and makes a\ncapital article in their public museum at Amsterdam, where the\nexhibitor relates the whole story to each spectator, with such\nadditions as he thinks proper. Some of his variations are rather\nextravagant; one of them is, that the lion jumped quite through the\ncrocodile, and was making his escape at the back door, when, as soon\nas his head appeared, Monsieur the Great Baron (as he is pleased to\ncall me) cut it off, and three feet of the crocodile’s tail along with\nit; nay, so little attention has this fellow to the truth, that he\nsometimes adds, as soon as the crocodile missed his tail, he turned\nabout, snatched the couteau de chasse out of Monsieur’s hand, and\nswallowed it with such eagerness that it pierced his heart and killed\nhim immediately!",
        "The little regard which this impudent knave has to veracity makes me\nsometimes apprehensive that my real facts may fall under suspicion,\nby being found in company with his confounded inventions.",
        "  In which the Baron proves himself a good shot–He loses his\n  horse, and finds a wolf–Makes him draw his sledge–Promises to\n  entertain his company with a relation of such facts as are well\n  deserving their notice.",
        "I set off from Rome on a journey to Russia, in the midst of winter,\nfrom a just notion that frost and snow must of course mend the roads,\nwhich every traveller had described as uncommonly bad through the\nnorthern parts of Germany, Poland, Courland, and Livonia. I went on\nhorseback, as the most convenient manner of travelling; I was but\nlightly clothed, and of this I felt the inconvenience the more I\nadvanced north-east. What must not a poor old man have suffered in\nthat severe weather and climate, whom I saw on a bleak common in\nPoland, lying on the road, helpless, shivering, and hardly having\nwherewithal to cover his nakedness? I pitied the poor soul: though I\nfelt the severity of the air myself, I threw my mantle over him, and\nimmediately I heard a voice from the heavens, blessing me for that\npiece of charity, saying–",
        "“You will be rewarded, my son, for this in time.”",
        "I went on: night and darkness overtook me. No village was to be seen.\nThe country was covered with snow, and I was unacquainted with the\nroad.",
        "Tired, I alighted, and fastened my horse to something like a pointed\nstump of a tree, which appeared above the snow; for the sake of safety\nI placed my pistols under my arm, and laid down on the snow, where I\nslept so soundly that I did not open my eyes till full daylight. It is\nnot easy to conceive my astonishment to find myself in the midst of a\nvillage, lying in a churchyard; nor was my horse to be seen, but I\nheard him soon after neigh somewhere above me. On looking upwards I\nbeheld him hanging by his bridle to the weather-cock of the steeple.\nMatters were now very plain to me: the village had been covered with\nsnow overnight; a sudden change of weather had taken place; I had sunk\ndown to the churchyard whilst asleep, gently, and in the same\nproportion as the snow had melted away; and what in the dark I had\ntaken to be a stump of a little tree appearing above the snow, to\nwhich I had tied my horse, proved to have been the cross or weather-\ncock of the steeple!",
        "Without long consideration I took one of my pistols, shot the bridle\nin two, brought the horse, and proceeded on my journey. [Here the\nBaron seems to have forgot his feelings; he should certainly have\nordered his horse a feed of corn, after fasting so long.]",
        "He carried me well–advancing into the interior parts of Russia. I\nfound travelling on horseback rather unfashionable in winter,\ntherefore I submitted, as I always do, to the custom of the country,\ntook a single horse sledge, and drove briskly towards St. Petersburg.\nI do not exactly recollect whether it was in Eastland or Jugemanland,\nbut I remember that in the midst of a dreary forest I spied a terrible\nwolf making after me, with all the speed of ravenous winter hunger. He\nsoon overtook me. There was no possibility of escape. Mechanically I\nlaid myself down flat in the sledge, and let my horse run for our\nsafety. What I wished, but hardly hoped or expected, happened\nimmediately after. The wolf did not mind me in the least, but took a\nleap over me, and falling furiously on the horse, began instantly to\ntear and devour the hind-part of the poor animal, which ran the faster\nfor his pain and terror. Thus unnoticed and safe myself, I lifted my\nhead slyly up, and with horror I beheld that the wolf had ate his way\ninto the horse’s body; it was not long before he had fairly forced\nhimself into it, when I took my advantage, and fell upon him with the\nbutt-end of my whip. This unexpected attack in his rear frightened him\nso much, that he leaped forward with all his might: the horse’s\ncarcase dropped on the ground, but in his place the wolf was in the\nharness, and I on my part whipping him continually: we both arrived in\nfull career safe at St. Petersburg, contrary to our respective\nexpectations, and very much to the astonishment of the spectators.",
        "I shall not tire you, gentlemen, with the politics, arts, sciences,\nand history of this magnificent metropolis of Russia, nor trouble you\nwith the various intrigues and pleasant adventures I had in the\npoliter circles of that country, where the lady of the house always\nreceives the visitor with a dram and a salute. I shall confine myself\nrather to the greater and nobler objects of your attention, horses and\ndogs, my favourites in the brute creation; also to foxes, wolves, and\nbears, with which, and game in general, Russia abounds more than any\nother part of the world; and to such sports, manly exercises, and\nfeats of gallantry and activity, as show the gentleman better than\nmusty Greek or Latin, or all the perfume, finery, and capers of French\nwits or petit-maîtres.",
        "  An encounter between the Baron’s nose and a door-post, with its\n  wonderful effects–Fifty brace of ducks and other fowl destroyed\n  by one shot–Flogs a fox out of his skin–Leads an old sow home in\n  a new way, and vanquishes a wild boar.",
        "It was some time before I could obtain a commission in the army, and\nfor several months I was perfectly at liberty to sport away my time\nand money in the most gentleman-like manner. You may easily imagine\nthat I spent much of both out of town with such gallant fellows as\nknew how to make the most of an open forest country. The very\nrecollection of those amusements gives me fresh spirits, and creates a\nwarm wish for a repetition of them. One morning I saw, through the\nwindows of my bed-room, that a large pond not far off was covered with\nwild ducks. In an instant I took my gun from the corner, ran down-\nstairs and out of the house in such a hurry, that I imprudently struck\nmy face against the door-post. Fire flew out of my eyes, but it did\nnot prevent my intention; I soon came within shot, when, levelling my\npiece, I observed to my sorrow, that even the flint had sprung from\nthe cock by the violence of the shock I had just received. There was\nno time to be lost. I presently remembered the effect it had on my\neyes, therefore opened the pan, levelled my piece against the wild\nfowls, and my fist against one of my eyes. [The Baron’s eyes have\nretained fire ever since, and appear particularly illuminated when he\nrelates this anecdote.] A hearty blow drew sparks again; the shot went\noff, and I killed fifty brace of ducks, twenty widgeons, and three\ncouple of teals. Presence of mind is the soul of manly exercises. If\nsoldiers and sailors owe to it many of their lucky escapes, hunters\nand sportsmen are not less beholden to it for many of their successes.\nIn a noble forest in Russia I met a fine black fox, whose valuable\nskin it would have been a pity to tear by ball or shot. Reynard stood\nclose to a tree. In a twinkling I took out my ball, and placed a good\nspike-nail in its room, fired, and hit him so cleverly that I nailed\nhis brush fast to the tree. I now went up to him, took out my hanger,\ngave him a cross-cut over the face, laid hold of my whip, and fairly\nflogged him out of his fine skin.",
        "Chance and good luck often correct our mistakes; of this I had a\nsingular instance soon after, when, in the depth of a forest, I saw a\nwild pig and sow running close behind each other. My ball had missed\nthem, yet the foremost pig only ran away, and the sow stood\nmotionless, as fixed to the ground. On examining into the matter, I\nfound the latter one to be an old sow, blind with age, which had taken\nhold of her pig’s tail, in order to be led along by filial duty. My\nball, having passed between the two, had cut his leading-string, which\nthe old sow continued to hold in her mouth; and as her former guide\ndid not draw her on any longer, she had stopped of course; I therefore\nlaid hold of the remaining end of the pig’s tail, and led the old\nbeast home without any further trouble on my part, and without any\nreluctance or apprehension on the part of the helpless old animal.",
        "Terrible as these wild sows are, yet more fierce and dangerous are the\nboars, one of which I had once the misfortune to meet in a forest,\nunprepared for attack or defence. I retired behind an oak-tree just\nwhen the furious animal levelled a side-blow at me, with such force,\nthat his tusks pierced through the tree, by which means he could\nneither repeat the blow nor retire. Ho, ho! thought I, I shall soon\nhave you now! and immediately I laid hold of a stone, wherewith I\nhammered and bent his tusks in such a manner, that he could not\nretreat by any means, and must wait my return from the next village,\nwhither I went for ropes and a cart, to secure him properly, and to\ncarry him off safe and alive, in which I perfectly succeeded.",

        "You have heard, I dare say, of the hunter and sportsman’s saint and\nprotector, St. Hubert, and of the noble stag, which appeared to him in\nthe forest, with the holy cross between his antlers. I have paid my\nhomage to that saint every year in good fellowship, and seen this stag\na thousand times, either painted in churches, or embroidered in the\nstars of his knights; so that, upon the honour and conscience of a\ngood sportsman, I hardly know whether there may not have been\nformerly, or whether there are not such crossed stags even at this\npresent day. But let me rather tell what I have seen myself. Having\none day spent all my shot, I found myself unexpectedly in presence of\na stately stag, looking at me as unconcernedly as if he had known of\nmy empty pouches. I charged immediately with powder, and upon it a\ngood handful of cherry-stones, for I had sucked the fruit as far as\nthe hurry would permit. Thus I let fly at him, and hit him just on the\nmiddle of the forehead, between his antlers; it stunned him–he\nstaggered–yet he made off. A year or two after, being with a party in\nthe same forest, I beheld a noble stag with a fine full grown cherry-\ntree above ten feet high between his antlers. I immediately\nrecollected my former adventure, looked upon him as my property, and\nbrought him to the ground by one shot, which at once gave me the\nhaunch and cherry-sauce; for the tree was covered with the richest\nfruit, the like I had never tasted before. Who knows but some\npassionate holy sportsman, or sporting abbot or bishop, may have shot,\nplanted, and fixed the cross between the antlers of St. Hubert’s stag,\nin a manner similar to this? They always have been, and still are,\nfamous for plantations of crosses and antlers; and in a case of\ndistress or dilemma, which too often happens to keen sportsmen, one is\napt to grasp at anything for safety, and to try any expedient rather\nthan miss the favourable opportunity. I have many times found myself\nin that trying situation.",
        "What do you say of this, for example? Daylight and powder were spent\none day in a Polish forest. When I was going home a terrible bear made\nup to me in great speed, with open mouth, ready to fall upon me; all\nmy pockets were searched in an instant for powder and ball, but in\nvain; I found nothing but two spare flints: one I flung with all my\nmight into the monster’s open jaws, down his throat. It gave him pain\nand made him turn about, so that I could level the second at his back-\ndoor, which, indeed, I did with wonderful success; for it flew in, met\nthe first flint in the stomach, struck fire, and blew up the bear with\na terrible explosion. Though I came safe off that time, yet I should\nnot wish to try it again, or venture against bears with no other\nammunition.",
        "There is a kind of fatality in it. The fiercest and most dangerous\nanimals generally came upon me when defenceless, as if they had a\nnotion or an instinctive intimation of it. Thus a frightful wolf\nrushed upon me so suddenly, and so close, that I could do nothing but\nfollow mechanical instinct, and thrust my fist into his open mouth.\nFor safety’s sake I pushed on and on, till my arm was fairly in up to\nthe shoulder. How should I disengage myself? I was not much pleased\nwith my awkward situation–with a wolf face to face; our ogling was\nnot of the most pleasant kind. If I withdrew my arm, then the animal\nwould fly the more furiously upon me; that I saw in his flaming eyes.\nIn short, I laid hold of his tail, turned him inside out like a glove,\nand flung him to the ground, where I left him.",
        "The same expedient would not have answered against a mad dog, which\nsoon after came running against me in a narrow street at St.\nPetersburg. Run who can, I thought; and to do this the better, I threw\noff my fur cloak, and was safe within doors in an instant. I sent my\nservant for the cloak, and he put it in the wardrobe with my other\nclothes. The day after I was amazed and frightened by Jack’s bawling,\n\"For God’s sake, sir, your fur cloak is mad!” I hastened up to him,\nand found almost all my clothes tossed about and torn to pieces. The\nfellow was perfectly right in his apprehensions about the fur cloak’s\nmadness. I saw him myself just then falling upon a fine full-dress\nsuit, which he shook and tossed in an unmerciful manner.",

        "All these narrow and lucky escapes, gentlemen, were chances turned to\nadvantage by presence of mind and vigorous exertions, which, taken\ntogether, as everybody knows, make the fortunate sportsman, sailor,\nand soldier; but he would be a very blamable and imprudent sportsman,\nadmiral, or general, who would always depend upon chance and his\nstars, without troubling himself about those arts which are their\nparticular pursuits, and without providing the very best implements,\nwhich insure success. I was not blamable either way; for I have always\nbeen as remarkable for the excellency of my horses, dogs, guns, and\nswords, as for the proper manner of using and managing them, so that\nupon the whole I may hope to be remembered in the forest, upon the\nturf, and in the field. I shall not enter here into any detail of my\nstables, kennel, or armoury; but a favourite bitch of mine I cannot\nhelp mentioning to you; she was a greyhound, and I never had or saw a\nbetter. She grew old in my service, and was not remarkable for her\nsize, but rather for her uncommon swiftness. I always coursed with\nher. Had you seen her you must have admired her, and would not have\nwondered at my predilection, and at my coursing her so much. She ran\nso fast, so much, and so long in my service, that she actually ran off\nher legs; so that, in the latter part of her life, I was under the\nnecessity of working and using her only as a terrier, in which quality\nshe still served me many years.",
        "Coursing one day a hare, which appeared to me uncommonly big, I pitied\nmy poor bitch, being big with pups, yet she would course as fast as\never. I could follow her on horseback only at a great distance. At\nonce I heard a cry as it were of a pack of hounds–but so weak and\nfaint that I hardly knew what to make of it. Coming up to them, I was\ngreatly surprised. The hare had littered in running; the same had\nhappened to my bitch in coursing, and there were just as many leverets\nas pups. By instinct the former ran, the latter coursed: and thus I\nfound myself in possession at once of six hares, and as many dogs, at\nthe end of a course which had only begun with one.",
        "I remember this, my wonderful bitch, with the same pleasure and\ntenderness as a superb Lithuanian horse, which no money could have\nbought. He became mine by an accident, which gave me an opportunity of\nshowing my horsemanship to a great advantage. I was at Count\nPrzobossky’s noble country-seat in Lithuania, and remained with the\nladies at tea in the drawing-room, while the gentlemen were down in\nthe yard, to see a young horse of blood which had just arrived from\nthe stud. We suddenly heard a noise of distress; I hastened down-\nstairs, and found the horse so unruly, that nobody durst approach or\nmount him. The most resolute horsemen stood dismayed and aghast;\ndespondency was expressed in every countenance, when, in one leap, I\nwas on his back, took him by surprise, and worked him quite into\ngentleness and obedience with the best display of horsemanship I was\nmaster of. Fully to show this to the ladies, and save them unnecessary\ntrouble, I forced him to leap in at one of the open windows of the\ntea-room, walked round several times, pace, trot, and gallop, and at\nlast made him mount the tea-table, there to repeat his lessons in a\npretty style of miniature which was exceedingly pleasing to the\nladies, for he performed them amazingly well, and did not break either\ncup or saucer. It placed me so high in their opinion, and so well in\nthat of the noble lord, that, with his usual politeness, he begged I\nwould accept of this young horse, and ride him full career to conquest\nand honour in the campaign against the Turks, which was soon to be\nopened, under the command of Count Munich.",
        "I could not indeed have received a more agreeable present, nor a more\nominous one at the opening of that campaign, in which I made my\napprenticeship as a soldier. A horse so gentle, so spirited, and so\nfierce–at once a lamb and a Bucephalus, put me always in mind of the\nsoldier’s and the gentleman’s duty! of young Alexander, and of the\nastonishing things he performed in the field.",
        "We took the field, among several other reasons, it seems, with an\nintention to retrieve the character of the Russian arms, which had\nbeen blemished a little by Czar Peter’s last campaign on the Pruth;\nand this we fully accomplished by several very fatiguing and glorious\ncampaigns under the command of that great general I mentioned before.",
        "Modesty forbids individuals to arrogate to themselves great successes\nor victories, the glory of which is generally engrossed by the\ncommander–nay, which is rather awkward, by kings and queens who never\nsmelt gunpowder but at the field-days and reviews of their troops;\nnever saw a field of battle, or an enemy in battle array.",
        "Nor do I claim any particular share of glory in the great engagements\nwith the enemy. We all did our duty, which, in the patriot’s,\nsoldier’s, and gentleman’s language, is a very comprehensive word, of\ngreat honour, meaning, and import, and of which the generality of idle\nquidnuncs and coffee-house politicians can hardly form any but a very\nmean and contemptible idea. However, having had the command of a body\nof hussars, I went upon several expeditions, with discretionary\npowers; and the success I then met with is, I think, fairly and only\nto be placed to my account, and to that of the brave fellows whom I\nled on to conquest and to victory. We had very hot work once in the\nvan of the army, when we drove the Turks into Oczakow. My spirited\nLithuanian had almost brought me into a scrape: I had an advanced\nfore-post, and saw the enemy coming against me in a cloud of dust,\nwhich left me rather uncertain about their actual numbers and real\nintentions: to wrap myself up in a similar cloud was common prudence,\nbut would not have much advanced my knowledge, or answered the end for\nwhich I had been sent out; therefore I let my flankers on both wings\nspread to the right and left and make what dust they could, and I\nmyself led on straight upon the enemy, to have nearer sight of them:\nin this I was gratified, for they stood and fought, till, for fear of\nmy flankers, they began to move off rather disorderly. This was the\nmoment to fall upon them with spirit; we broke them entirely–made a\nterrible havoc amongst them, and drove them not only back to a walled\ntown in their rear, but even through it, contrary to our most sanguine\nexpectation.",
        "The swiftness of my Lithuanian enabled me to be foremost in the\npursuit; and seeing the enemy fairly flying through the opposite gate,\nI thought it would be prudent to stop in the market-place, to order\nthe men to rendezvous. I stopped, gentlemen; but judge of my\nastonishment when in this market-place I saw not one of my hussars\nabout me! Are they scouring the other streets? or what is become of\nthem? They could not be far off, and must, at all events, soon join\nme. In that expectation I walked my panting Lithuanian to a spring in\nthis market-place, and let him drink. He drank uncommonly, with an\neagerness not to be satisfied, but natural enough; for when I looked\nround for my men, what should I see, gentlemen! the hind part of the\npoor creature–croup and legs were missing, as if he had been cut in\ntwo, and the water ran out as it came in, without refreshing or doing\nhim any good! How it could have happened was quite a mystery to me,\ntill I returned with him to the town-gate. There I saw, that when I\nrushed in pell-mell with the flying enemy, they had dropped the\nportcullis (a heavy falling door, with sharp spikes at the bottom, let\ndown suddenly to prevent the entrance of an enemy into a fortified\ntown) unperceived by me, which had totally cut off his hind part, that\nstill lay quivering on the outside of the gate. It would have been an\nirreparable loss, had not our farrier contrived to bring both parts\ntogether while hot. He sewed them up with sprigs and young shoots of\nlaurels that were at hand; the wound healed, and, what could not have\nhappened but to so glorious a horse, the sprigs took root in his body,\ngrew up, and formed a bower over me; so that afterwards I could go\nupon many other expeditions in the shade of my own and my horse’s\nlaurels.",

        "I was not always successful. I had the misfortune to be overpowered by\nnumbers, to be made prisoner of war; and, what is worse, but always\nusual among the Turks, to be sold for a slave. [The Baron was\nafterwards in great favour with the Grand Seignior, as will appear\nhereafter.] In that state of humiliation my daily task was not very\nhard and laborious, but rather singular and irksome. It was to drive\nthe Sultan’s bees every morning to their pasture-grounds, to attend\nthem all the day long, and against night to drive them back to their\nhives. One evening I missed a bee, and soon observed that two bears\nhad fallen upon her to tear her to pieces for the honey she carried. I\nhad nothing like an offensive weapon in my hands but the silver\nhatchet, which is the badge of the Sultan’s gardeners and farmers. I\nthrew it at the robbers, with an intention to frighten them away, and\nset the poor bee at liberty; but, by an unlucky turn of my arm, it\nflew upwards, and continued rising till it reached the moon. How\nshould I recover it? how fetch it down again? I recollected that\nTurkey-beans grow very quick, and run up to an astonishing height. I\nplanted one immediately; it grew, and actually fastened itself to one\nof the moon’s horns. I had no more to do now but to climb up by it\ninto the moon, where I safely arrived, and had a troublesome piece of\nbusiness before I could find my silver hatchet, in a place where\neverything has the brightness of silver; at last, however, I found it\nin a heap of chaff and chopped straw. I was now for returning: but,\nalas! the heat of the sun had dried up my bean; it was totally useless\nfor my descent: so I fell to work, and twisted me a rope of that\nchopped straw, as long and as well as I could make it. This I fastened\nto one of the moon’s horns, and slid down to the end of it. Here I\nheld myself fast with the left hand, and with the hatchet in my right,\nI cut the long, now useless end of the upper part, which, when tied to\nthe lower end, brought me a good deal lower: this repeated splicing\nand tying of the rope did not improve its quality, or bring me down to\nthe Sultan’s farm. I was four or five miles from the earth at least\nwhen it broke; I fell to the ground with such amazing violence, that I\nfound myself stunned, and in a hole nine fathoms deep at least, made\nby the weight of my body falling from so great a height: I recovered,\nbut knew not how to get out again; however, I dug slopes or steps with\nmy finger-nails [the Baron’s nails were then of forty years’ growth],\nand easily accomplished it.",
        "Peace was soon after concluded with the Turks, and gaining my liberty,\nI left St. Petersburg at the time of that singular revolution, when\nthe emperor in his cradle, his mother, the Duke of Brunswick, her\nfather, Field-Marshal Munich, and many others were sent to Siberia.\nThe winter was then so uncommonly severe all over Europe, that ever\nsince the sun seems to be frost-bitten. At my return to this place, I\nfelt on the road greater inconveniences than those I had experienced\non my setting out.",
        "I travelled post, and finding myself in a narrow lane, bid the\npostillion give a signal with his horn, that other travellers might\nnot meet us in the narrow passage. He blew with all his might; but his\nendeavours were in vain, he could not make the horn sound, which was\nunaccountable, and rather unfortunate, for soon after we found\nourselves in the presence of another coach coming the other way: there\nwas no proceeding; however, I got out of my carriage, and being pretty\nstrong, placed it, wheels and all, upon my head: I then jumped over a\nhedge about nine feet high (which, considering the weight of the\ncoach, was rather difficult) into a field, and came out again by\nanother jump into the road beyond the other carriage: I then went back\nfor the horses, and placing one upon my head, and the other under my\nleft arm, by the same means brought them to my coach, put to, and\nproceeded to an inn at the end of our stage. I should have told you\nthat the horse under my arm was very spirited, and not above four\nyears old; in making my second spring over the hedge, he expressed\ngreat dislike to that violent kind of motion by kicking and snorting;\nhowever, I confined his hind legs by putting them into my coat-pocket.\nAfter we arrived at the inn my postillion and I refreshed ourselves:\nhe hung his horn on a peg near the kitchen fire; I sat on the other\nside.",
        "Suddenly we heard a tereng! tereng! teng! teng! We looked round, and\nnow found the reason why the postillion had not been able to sound his\nhorn; his tunes were frozen up in the horn, and came out now by\nthawing, plain enough, and much to the credit of the driver; so that\nthe honest fellow entertained us for some time with a variety of\ntunes, without putting his mouth to the horn–\"The King of Prussia’s\nMarch,” “Over the Hill and over the Dale,” with many other favourite\ntunes; at length the thawing entertainment concluded, as I shall this\nshort account of my Russian travels.",

        "I embarked at Portsmouth in a first-rate English man-of-war, of one\nhundred guns, and fourteen hundred men, for North America. Nothing\nworth relating happened till we arrived within three hundred leagues\nof the river St. Laurence, when the ship struck with amazing force\nagainst (as we supposed) a rock; however, upon heaving the lead we\ncould find no bottom, even with three hundred fathom. What made this\ncircumstance the more wonderful, and indeed beyond all comprehension,\nwas, that the violence of the shock was such that we lost our rudder,\nbroke our bowsprit in the middle, and split all our masts from top to\nbottom, two of which went by the board; a poor fellow, who was aloft\nfurling the mainsheet, was flung at least three leagues from the ship;\nbut he fortunately saved his life by laying hold of the tail of a\nlarge sea-gull, who brought him back, and lodged him on the very spot\nfrom whence he was thrown. Another proof of the violence of the shock\nwas the force with which the people between decks were driven against\nthe floors above them; my head particularly was pressed into my\nstomach, where it continued some months before it recovered its\nnatural situation. Whilst we were all in a state of astonishment at\nthe general and unaccountable confusion in which we were involved, the\nwhole was suddenly explained by the appearance of a large whale, who\nhad been basking, asleep, within sixteen feet of the surface of the\nwater. This animal was so much displeased with the disturbance which\nour ship had given him–for in our passage we had with our rudder\nscratched his nose–that he beat in all the gallery and part of the\nquarter-deck with his tail, and almost at the same instant took the\nmainsheet anchor, which was suspended, as it usually is, from the\nhead, between his teeth, and ran away with the ship, at least sixty\nleagues, at the rate of twelve leagues an hour, when fortunately the\ncable broke, and we lost both the whale and the anchor. However, upon\nour return to Europe, some months after, we found the same whale\nwithin a few leagues of the same spot, floating dead upon the water;\nit measured above half a mile in length. As we could take but a small\nquantity of such a monstrous animal on board, we got our boats out,\nand with much difficulty cut off his head, where, to our great joy, we\nfound the anchor, and above forty fathom of the cable, concealed on\nthe left side of his mouth, just under his tongue. [Perhaps this was\nthe cause of his death, as that side of his tongue was much swelled,\nwith a great degree of inflammation.] This was the only extraordinary\ncircumstance that happened on this voyage. One part of our distress,\nhowever, I had like to have forgot: while the whale was running away\nwith the ship she sprung a leak, and the water poured in so fast, that\nall our pumps could not keep us from sinking; it was, however, my good\nfortune to discover it first. I found it a large hole about a foot\ndiameter; you will naturally suppose this circumstance gives me\ninfinite pleasure, when I inform you that this noble vessel was\npreserved, with all its crew, by a most fortunate thought! in short, I\nsat down over it, and could have dispensed with it had it been larger;\nnor will you be surprised when I inform you I am descended from Dutch\nparents. [The Baron’s ancestors have but lately settled there; in\nanother part of his adventures he boasts of royal blood.]",

        "I was once in great danger of being lost in a most singular manner in\nthe Mediterranean: I was bathing in that pleasant sea near Marseilles\none summer’s afternoon, when I discovered a very large fish, with his\njaws quite extended, approaching me with the greatest velocity; there\nwas no time to be lost, nor could I possibly avoid him. I immediately\nreduced myself to as small a size as possible, by closing my feet and\nplacing my hands also near my sides, in which position I passed\ndirectly between his jaws, and into his stomach, where I remained some\ntime in total darkness, and comfortably warm, as you may imagine; at\nlast it occurred to me, that by giving him pain he would be glad to\nget rid of me: as I had plenty of room, I played my pranks, such as\ntumbling, hop, step, and jump, &c., but nothing seemed to disturb him\nso much as the quick motion of my feet in attempting to dance a\nhornpipe; soon after I began he put me out by sudden fits and starts:\nI persevered; at last he roared horridly, and stood up almost\nperpendicularly in the water, with his head and shoulders exposed, by\nwhich he was discovered by the people on board an Italian trader, then\nsailing by, who harpooned him in a few minutes. As soon as he was\nbrought on board I heard the crew consulting how they should cut him\nup, so as to preserve the greatest quantity of oil. As I understood\nItalian, I was in most dreadful apprehensions lest their weapons\nemployed in this business should destroy me also; therefore I stood as\nnear the centre as possible, for there was room enough for a dozen men\nin this creature’s stomach, and I naturally imagined they would begin\nwith the extremities; however, my fears were soon dispersed, for they\nbegan by opening the bottom of the belly. As soon as I perceived a\nglimmering of light I called out lustily to be released from a\nsituation in which I was now almost suffocated. It is impossible for\nme to do justice to the degree and kind of astonishment which sat upon\nevery countenance at hearing a human voice issue from a fish, but more\nso at seeing a naked man walk upright out of his body; in short,\ngentlemen, I told them the whole story, as I have done you, whilst\namazement struck them dumb.",
        "After taking some refreshment, and jumping into the sea to cleanse\nmyself, I swam to my clothes, which lay where I had left them on the\nshore. As near as I can calculate, I was near four hours and a half\nconfined in the stomach of this animal.",

        "When I was in the service of the Turks I frequently amused myself in a\npleasure-barge on the Marmora, which commands a view of the whole city\nof Constantinople, including the Grand Seignior’s Seraglio. One\nmorning, as I was admiring the beauty and serenity of the sky, I\nobserved a globular substance in the air, which appeared to be about\nthe size of a twelve-inch globe, with somewhat suspended from it. I\nimmediately took up my largest and longest barrel fowling-piece, which\nI never travel or make even an excursion without, if I can help it; I\ncharged with a ball, and fired at the globe, but to no purpose, the\nobject being at too great a distance. I then put in a double quantity\nof powder, and five or six balls: this second attempt succeeded; all\nthe balls took effect, and tore one side open, and brought it down.\nJudge my surprise when a most elegant gilt car, with a man in it, and\npart of a sheep which seemed to have been roasted, fell within two\nyards of me. When my astonishment had in some degree subsided, I\nordered my people to row close to this strange aërial traveller.",
        "I took him on board my barge (he was a native of France): he was much\nindisposed from his sudden fall into the sea, and incapable of\nspeaking; after some time, however, he recovered, and gave the\nfollowing account of himself, viz.: “About seven or eight days since,\nI cannot tell which, for I have lost my reckoning, having been most of\nthe time where the sun never sets, I ascended from the Land’s End in\nCornwall, in the island of Great Britain, in the car from which I have\nbeen just taken, suspended from a very large balloon, and took a sheep\nwith me to try atmospheric experiments upon: unfortunately, the wind\nchanged within ten minutes after my ascent, and instead of driving\ntowards Exeter, where I intended to land, I was driven towards the\nsea, over which I suppose I have continued ever since, but much too\nhigh to make observations.",
        "“The calls of hunger were so pressing, that the intended experiments\nupon heat and respiration gave way to them. I was obliged, on the\nthird day, to kill the sheep for food; and being at that time\ninfinitely above the moon, and for upwards of sixteen hours after so\nvery near the sun that it scorched my eyebrows, I placed the carcase,\ntaking care to skin it first, in that part of the car where the sun\nhad sufficient power, or, in other words, where the balloon did not\nshade it from the sun, by which method it was well roasted in about\ntwo hours. This has been my food ever since.” Here he paused, and\nseemed lost in viewing the objects about him. When I told him the\nbuildings before us were the Grand Seignior’s Seraglio at\nConstantinople, he seemed exceedingly affected, as he had supposed\nhimself in a very different situation. “The cause,” added he, “of my\nlong flight, was owing to the failure of a string which was fixed to a\nvalve in the balloon, intended to let out the inflammable air; and if\nit had not been fired at, and rent in the manner before mentioned, I\nmight, like Mahomet, have been suspended between heaven and earth till\ndoomsday.”",
        "The Grand Seignior, to whom I was introduced by the Imperial, Russian,\nand French ambassadors, employed me to negotiate a matter of great\nimportance at Grand Cairo, and which was of such a nature that it must\never remain a secret.",
        "I went there in great state by land; where, having completed the\nbusiness, I dismissed almost all my attendants, and returned like a\nprivate gentleman; the weather was delightful, and that famous river\nthe Nile was beautiful beyond all description; in short, I was tempted\nto hire a barge to descend by water to Alexandria. On the third day of\nmy voyage the river began to rise most amazingly (you have all heard,\nI presume, of the annual overflowing of the Nile), and on the next day\nit spread the whole country for many leagues on each side! On the\nfifth, at sunrise, my barge became entangled with what I at first took\nfor shrubs, but as the light became stronger I found myself surrounded\nby almonds, which were perfectly ripe, and in the highest perfection.\nUpon plumbing with a line my people found we were at least sixty feet\nfrom the ground, and unable to advance or retreat. At about eight or\nnine o’clock, as near as I could judge by the altitude of the sun, the\nwind rose suddenly, and canted our barge on one side: here she filled,\nand I saw no more of her for some time. Fortunately we all saved\nourselves (six men and two boys) by clinging to the tree, the boughs\nof which were equal to our weight, though not to that of the barge: in\nthis situation we continued six weeks and three days, living upon the\nalmonds; I need not inform you we had plenty of water. On the forty-\nsecond day of our distress the water fell as rapidly as it had risen,\nand on the forty-sixth we were able to venture down upon terra\nfirma. Our barge was the first pleasing object we saw, about two\nhundred yards from the spot where she sunk. After drying everything\nthat was useful by the heat of the sun, and loading ourselves with\nnecessaries from the stores on board, we set out to recover our lost\nground, and found, by the nearest calculation, we had been carried\nover garden-walls, and a variety of enclosures, above one hundred and\nfifty miles. In four days, after a very tiresome journey on foot, with\nthin shoes, we reached the river, which was now confined to its banks,\nrelated our adventures to a boy, who kindly accommodated all our\nwants, and sent us forward in a barge of his own. In six days more we\narrived at Alexandria, where we took shipping for Constantinople. I\nwas received kindly by the Grand Seignior, and had the honour of\nseeing the Seraglio, to which his highness introduced me himself.",

The enemy’s\nball recoiled back with such violence as to kill the man who had\ndischarged it, by carrying his head fairly off, with sixteen others\nwhich it met with in its progress to the Barbary coast, where its\nforce, after passing through three masts of vessels that then lay in a\nline behind each other in the harbour, was so much spent, that it only\nbroke its way through the roof of a poor labourer’s hut, about two\nhundred yards inland, and destroyed a few teeth an old woman had left,\nwho lay asleep upon her back with her mouth open. The ball lodged in\nher throat. Her husband soon after came home, and endeavoured to\nextract it; but finding that impracticable, by the assistance of a\nrammer he forced it into her stomach. Our ball did excellent service;\nfor it not only repelled the other in the manner just described, but,\nproceeding as I intended it should, it dismounted the very piece of\ncannon that had just been employed against us, and forced it into the\nhold of the ship, where it fell with so much force as to break its way\nthrough the bottom. The ship immediately filled and sank, with above a\nthousand Spanish sailors on board, besides a considerable number of\nsoldiers. This, to be sure, was a most extraordinary exploit; I will\nnot, however, take the whole merit to myself; my judgment was the\nprincipal engine, but chance assisted me a little; for I afterwards\nfound, that the man who charged our forty-eight pounder put in, by\nmistake, a double quantity of powder, else we could never have\nsucceeded so much beyond all expectation, especially in repelling the\nenemy’s ball.",
        "General Elliot would have given me a commission for this singular\npiece of service; but I declined everything, except his thanks, which\nI received at a crowded table of officers at supper on the evening of\nthat very day.",
        "As I am very partial to the English, who are beyond all doubt a brave\npeople, I determined not to take my leave of the garrison till I had\nrendered them another piece of service, and in about three weeks an\nopportunity presented itself. I dressed myself in the habit of a\nPopish priest, and at about one o’clock in the morning stole out of\nthe garrison, passed the enemy’s lines, and arrived in the middle of\ntheir camp, where I entered the tent in which the Prince d’Artois was,\nwith the commander-in-chief, and several other officers, in deep\ncouncil, concerting a plan to storm the garrison next morning. My\ndisguise was my protection; they suffered me to continue there,\nhearing everything that passed, till they went to their several beds.\nWhen I found the whole camp, and even the sentinels, were wrapped up\nin the arms of Morpheus, I began my work, which was that of\ndismounting all their cannon (above three hundred pieces), from forty-\neight to twenty-four pounders, and throwing them three leagues into\nthe sea. Having no assistance, I found this the hardest task I ever\nundertook, except swimming to the opposite shore with the famous\nTurkish piece of ordnance, described by Baron de Tott in his Memoirs,\nwhich I shall hereafter mention. I then piled all the carriages\ntogether in the centre of the camp, which, to prevent the noise of the\nwheels being heard, I carried in pairs under my arms; and a noble\nappearance they made, as high at least as the rock of Gibraltar. I\nthen lighted a match by striking a flint stone, situated twenty feet\nfrom the ground (in an old wall built by the Moors when they invaded\nSpain), with the breech of an iron eight-and-forty pounder, and so set\nfire to the whole pile. I forgot to inform you that I threw all their\nammunition-waggons upon the top.",
        "Before I applied the lighted match I had laid the combustibles at the\nbottom so judiciously, that the whole was in a blaze in a moment. To\nprevent suspicion I was one of the first to express my surprise. The\nwhole camp was, as you may imagine, petrified with astonishment: the\ngeneral conclusion was, that their sentinels had been bribed, and that\nseven or eight regiments of the garrison had been employed in this\nhorrid destruction of their artillery. Mr. Drinkwater, in his account\nof this famous siege, mentions the enemy sustaining a great loss by a\nfire which happened in their camp, but never knew the cause; how\nshould he? as I never divulged it before (though I alone saved\nGibraltar by this night’s business), not even to General Elliot. The\nCount d’Artois and all his attendants ran away in their fright, and\nnever stopped on the road till they reached Paris, which they did in\nabout a fortnight; this dreadful conflagration had such an effect upon\nthem that they were incapable of taking the least refreshment for\nthree months after, but, chameleon-like, lived upon the air.",
        "If any gentleman will say he doubts the truth of this story, I will\nfine him a gallon of brandy and make him drink it at one draught.",
        "About two months after I had done the besieged this service, one\nmorning, as I sat at breakfast with General Elliot, a shell (for I had\nnot time to destroy their mortars as well as their cannon) entered the\napartment we were sitting in; it lodged upon our table: the General,\nas most men would do, quitted the room directly; but I took it up\nbefore it burst, and carried it to the top of the rock, when, looking\nover the enemy’s camp, on an eminence near the sea-coast I observed a\nconsiderable number of people, but could not, with my naked eye,\ndiscover how they were employed. I had recourse again to my telescope,\nwhen I found that two of our officers, one a general, the other a\ncolonel, with whom I spent the preceding evening, and who went out\ninto the enemy’s camp about midnight as spies, were taken, and then\nwere actually going to be executed on a gibbet. I found the distance\ntoo great to throw the shell with my hand, but most fortunately\nrecollecting that I had the very sling in my pocket which assisted\nDavid in slaying Goliath, I placed the shell in it, and immediately\nthrew it in the midst of them: it burst as it fell, and destroyed all\npresent, except the two culprits, who were saved by being suspended so\nhigh, for they were just turned off: however, one of the pieces of the\nshell fled with such force against the foot of the gibbet, that it\nimmediately brought it down. Our two friends no sooner felt terra\nfirma than they looked about for the cause; and finding their guards,\nexecutioner, and all, had taken it in their heads to die first, they\ndirectly extricated each other from their disgraceful cords, and then\nran down to the sea-shore, seized a Spanish boat with two men in it,\nand made them row to one of our ships, which they did with great\nsafety, and in a few minutes after, when I was relating to General\nElliot how I had acted, they both took us by the hand, and after\nmutual congratulations we retired to spend the day with festivity.",

        "You wish (I can see by your countenances) I would inform you how I\nbecame possessed of such a treasure as the sling just mentioned. (Here\nfacts must be held sacred.) Thus then it was: I am a descendant of the\nwife of Uriah, whom we all know David was intimate with; she had\nseveral children by his majesty; they quarrelled once upon a matter of\nthe first consequence, viz., the spot where Noah’s ark was built, and\nwhere it rested after the flood. A separation consequently ensued. She\nhad often heard him speak of this sling as his most valuable treasure:\nthis she stole the night they parted; it was missed before she got out\nof his dominions, and she was pursued by no less than six of the\nking’s body-guards: however, by using it herself she hit the first of\nthem (for one was more active in the pursuit than the rest) where\nDavid did Goliath, and killed him on the spot. His companions were so\nalarmed at his fall that they retired, and left Uriah’s wife to pursue\nher journey. She took with her, I should have informed you before, her\nfavourite son by this connection, to whom she bequeathed the sling;\nand thus it has, without interruption, descended from father to son\ntill it came into my possession. One of its possessors, my great-\ngreat-great-grandfather, who lived about two hundred and fifty years\nago, was upon a visit to England, and became intimate with a poet who\nwas a great deer-stealer; I think his name was Shakespeare: he\nfrequently borrowed this sling, and with it killed so much of Sir\nThomas Lucy’s venison, that he narrowly escaped the fate of my two\nfriends at Gibraltar. Poor Shakespeare was imprisoned, and my ancestor\nobtained his freedom in a very singular manner. Queen Elizabeth was\nthen on the throne, but grown so indolent, that every trifling matter\nwas a trouble to her; dressing, undressing, eating, drinking, and some\nother offices which shall be nameless, made life a burden to her; all\nthese things he enabled her to do without, or by a deputy! and what do\nyou think was the only return she could prevail upon him to accept for\nsuch eminent services? setting Shakespeare at liberty! Such was his\naffection for that famous writer, that he would have shortened his own\ndays to add to the number of his friend’s.",
        "I do not hear that any of the queen’s subjects, particularly the\nbeef-eaters, as they are vulgarly called to this day, however they\nmight be struck with the novelty at the time, much approved of her\nliving totally without food. She did not survive the practice herself\nabove seven years and a half.",
        "My father, who was the immediate possessor of this sling before me,\ntold me the following anecdote:–",
        "He was walking by the sea-shore at Harwich, with this sling in his\npocket; before his paces had covered a mile he was attacked by a\nfierce animal called a seahorse, open-mouthed, who ran at him with\ngreat fury; he hesitated a moment, then took out his sling, retreated\nback about a hundred yards, stooped for a couple of pebbles, of which\nthere were plenty under his feet, and slung them both so dexterously\nat the animal, that each stone put out an eye, and lodged in the\ncavities which their removal had occasioned. He now got upon his back,\nand drove him into the sea; for the moment he lost his sight he lost\nalso ferocity, and became as tame as possible: the sling was placed as\na bridle in his mouth; he was guided with the greatest facility across\nthe ocean, and in less than three hours they both arrived on the\nopposite shore, which is about thirty leagues. The master of the\nThree Cups, at Helvoetsluys, in Holland, purchased this marine\nhorse, to make an exhibition of, for seven hundred ducats, which was\nupwards of three hundred pounds, and the next day my father paid his\npassage back in the packet to Harwich.",
        "–My father made several curious observations in this passage, which\nI will relate hereafter.",
        "  The frolic; its consequences–Windsor Castle–St. Paul’s–College\n  of Physicians–Undertakers, sextons, &c., almost ruined–Industry\n  of the apothecaries.",
        "the Frolic.",
        "This famous sling makes the possessor equal to any task he is desirous\nof performing.",
        "I made a balloon of such extensive dimensions, that an account of the\nsilk it contained would exceed all credibility; every mercer’s shop\nand weaver’s stock in London, Westminster, and Spitalfields\ncontributed to it: with this balloon and my sling I played many\ntricks, such as taking one house from its station, and placing another\nin its stead, without disturbing the inhabitants, who were generally\nasleep, or too much employed to observe the peregrinations of their\nhabitations. When the sentinel at Windsor Castle heard St. Paul’s\nclock strike thirteen, it was through my dexterity; I brought the\nbuildings nearly together that night, by placing the castle in St.\nGeorge’s Fields, and carried it back again before daylight, without\nwaking any of the inhabitants; notwithstanding these exploits, I\nshould have kept my balloon, and its properties a secret, if\nMontgolfier had not made the art of flying so public.",
        "On the 30th of September, when the College of Physicians chose their\nannual officers, and dined sumptuously together, I filled my balloon,\nbrought it over the dome of their building, clapped the sling round\nthe golden ball at the top, fastening the other end of it to the\nballoon, and immediately ascended with the whole college to an immense\nheight, where I kept them upwards of three months. You will naturally\ninquire what they did for food such a length of time? To this I\nanswer, Had I kept them suspended twice the time, they would have\nexperienced no inconvenience on that account, so amply, or rather\nextravagantly, had they spread their table for that day’s feasting.",
        "Though this was meant as an innocent frolic, it was productive of much\nmischief to several respectable characters amongst the clergy,\nundertakers, sextons, and grave-diggers: they were, it must be\nacknowledged, sufferers; for it is a well-known fact, that during the\nthree months the college was suspended in the air, and therefore\nincapable of attending their patients, no deaths happened, except a\nfew who fell before the scythe of Father Time, and some melancholy\nobjects who, perhaps to avoid some trifling inconvenience here, laid\nthe hands of violence upon themselves, and plunged into misery\ninfinitely greater than that which they hoped by such a rash step to\navoid, without a moment’s consideration.",
        "If the apothecaries had not been very active during the above time,\nhalf the undertakers in all probability would have been bankrupts.",
        "                         A TRIP TO THE NORTH",
        "  The Baron sails with Captain Phipps, attacks two large bears, and\n  has a very narrow escape–Gains the confidence of these animals,\n  and then destroys thousands of them; loads the ship with their\n  hams and skins; makes presents of the former, and obtains a\n  general invitation to all city feasts–A dispute between the\n  Captain and the Baron, in which, from motives of politeness, the\n  Captain is suffered to gain his point–The Baron declines the\n  offer of a throne, and an empress into the bargain.",
        "We all remember Captain Phipps’s (now Lord Mulgrave) last voyage of\ndiscovery to the north. I accompanied the captain, not as an officer,\nbut as a private friend. When we arrived in a high northern latitude I\nwas viewing the objects around me with the telescope which I\nintroduced to your notice in my Gibraltar adventures. I thought I saw\ntwo large white bears in violent action upon a body of ice\nconsiderably above the masts, and about half a league distance. I\nimmediately took my carbine, slung it across my shoulder, and ascended\nthe ice. When I arrived at the top, the unevenness of the surface made\nmy approach to those animals troublesome and hazardous beyond\nexpression: sometimes hideous cavities opposed me, which I was obliged\nto spring over; in other parts the surface was as smooth as a mirror,\nand I was continually falling: as I approached near enough to reach\nthem, I found they were only at play. I immediately began to calculate\nthe value of their skins, for they were each as large as a well-fed\nox: unfortunately, at the very instant I was presenting my carbine my\nright foot slipped, I fell upon my back, and the violence of the blow\ndeprived me totally of my senses for nearly half an hour; however,\nwhen I recovered, judge of my surprise at finding one of those large\nanimals I have been just describing had turned me upon my face, and\nwas just laying hold of the waistband of my breeches, which were then\nnew and made of leather: he was certainly going to carry me feet\nforemost, God knows where, when I took this knife (showing a large\nclasp knife) out of my side-pocket, made a chop at one of his hind\nfeet, and cut off three of his toes; he immediately let me drop and\nroared most horribly. I took up my carbine and fired at him as he ran\noff; he fell directly. The noise of the piece roused several thousand\nof these white bears, who were asleep upon the ice within half a mile\nof me; they came immediately to the spot. There was no time to be\nlost. A most fortunate thought arrived in my pericranium just at that\ninstant. I took off the skin and head of the dead bear in half the\ntime that some people would be in skinning a rabbit, and wrapped\nmyself in it, placing my own head directly under Bruin’s; the whole\nherd came round me immediately, and my apprehensions threw me into a\nmost piteous situation to be sure: however, my scheme turned out a\nmost admirable one for my own safety. They all came smelling, and\nevidently took me for a brother Bruin; I wanted nothing but bulk to\nmake an excellent counterfeit: however, I saw several cubs amongst\nthem not much larger than myself. After they had all smelt me, and the\nbody of their deceased companion, whose skin was now become my\nprotector, we seemed very sociable, and I found I could mimic all\ntheir actions tolerably well; but at growling, roaring, and hugging\nthey were quite my masters. I began now to think that I might turn the\ngeneral confidence which I had created amongst these animals to my\nadvantage.",
        "I had heard an old army surgeon say a wound in the spine was instant\ndeath. I now determined to try the experiment, and had again recourse\nto my knife, with which I struck the largest in the back of the neck,\nnear the shoulders, but under great apprehensions, not doubting but\nthe creature would, if he survived the stab, tear me to pieces.\nHowever, I was remarkably fortunate, for he fell dead at my feet\nwithout making the least noise. I was now resolved to demolish them\nevery one in the same manner, which I accomplished without the least\ndifficulty; for although they saw their companions fall, they had no\nsuspicion of either the cause or the effect. When they all lay dead\nbefore me, I felt myself a second Samson, having slain my thousands.",
        "To make short of the story, I went back to the ship, and borrowed\nthree parts of the crew to assist me in skinning them, and carrying\nthe hams on board, which we did in a few hours, and loaded the ship\nwith them. As to the other parts of the animals, they were thrown into\nthe sea, though I doubt not but the whole would eat as well as the\nlegs, were they properly cured.",
        "As soon as we returned I sent some of the hams, in the captain’s name,\nto the Lords of Admiralty, others to the Lords of the Treasury, some\nto the Lord Mayor and Corporation of London, a few to each of the\ntrading companies, and the remainder to my particular friends, from\nall of whom I received warm thanks; but from the city I was honoured\nwith substantial notice, viz., an invitation to dine at Guildhall\nannually on Lord Mayor’s day.",
        "The bear-skins I sent to the Empress of Russia, to clothe her majesty\nand her court in the winter, for which she wrote me a letter of thanks\nwith her own hand, and sent it by an ambassador extraordinary,\ninviting me to share the honours of her crown; but as I never was\nambitious of royal dignity, I declined her majesty’s favour in the\npolitest terms. The same ambassador had orders to wait and bring my\nanswer to her majesty personally, upon which business he was absent\nabout three months: her majesty’s reply convinced me of the strength\nof her affections, and the dignity of her mind; her late indisposition\nwas entirely owing (as she, kind creature! was pleased to express\nherself in a late conversation with the Prince Dolgoroucki) to my\ncruelty. What the sex see in me I cannot conceive, but the Empress is\nnot the only female sovereign who has offered me her hand.",
        "Some people have very illiberally reported that Captain Phipps did not\nproceed as far as he might have done upon that expedition. Here it\nbecomes my duty to acquit him; our ship was in a very proper trim till\nI loaded it with such an immense quantity of bear-skins and hams,\nafter which it would have been madness to have attempted to proceed\nfurther, as we were now scarcely able to combat a brisk gale, much\nless those mountains of ice which lay in the higher latitudes.",
        "The captain has since often expressed a dissatisfaction that he had no\nshare in the honours of that day, which he emphatically called bear-\nskin day. He has also been very desirous of knowing by what art I\ndestroyed so many thousands, without fatigue or danger to myself;\nindeed, he is so ambitious of dividing the glory with me, that we have\nactually quarrelled about it, and we are not now upon speaking terms.\nHe boldly asserts I had no merit in deceiving the bears, because I was\ncovered with one of their skins; nay, he declares there is not, in his\nopinion, in Europe, so complete a bear naturally as himself among the\nhuman species.",

        "Baron de Tott, in his Memoirs, makes as great a parade of a single act\nas many travellers whose whole lives have been spent in seeing the\ndifferent parts of the globe; for my part, if I had been blown from\nEurope to Asia from the mouth of a cannon, I should have boasted less\nof it afterwards than he has done of only firing off a Turkish piece\nof ordnance. What he says of this wonderful gun, as near as my memory\nwill serve me, is this:–\"The Turks had placed below the castle, and\nnear the city, on the banks of Simois, a celebrated river, an enormous\npiece of ordnance cast in brass, which would carry a marble ball of\neleven hundred pounds weight. I was inclined,” says Tott, “to fire it,\nbut I was willing first to judge of its effect; the crowd about me\ntrembled at this proposal, as they asserted it would overthrow not\nonly the castle, but the city also; at length their fears in part\nsubsided, and I was permitted to discharge it. It required not less\nthan three hundred and thirty pounds’ weight of powder, and the ball\nweighed, as before mentioned, eleven hundredweight. When the engineer\nbrought the priming, the crowds who were about me retreated back as\nfast as they could; nay, it was with the utmost difficulty I persuaded\nthe Pacha, who came on purpose, there was no danger: even the engineer\nwho was to discharge it by my direction was considerably alarmed. I\ntook my stand on some stone-work behind the cannon, gave the signal,\nand felt a shock like that of earthquake! At the distance of three\nhundred fathom the ball burst into three pieces; the fragments crossed\nthe strait, rebounded on the opposite mountain, and left the surface\nof the water all in a foam through the whole breadth of the channel.”",
        "This, gentlemen, is, as near as I can recollect, Baron Tott’s account\nof the largest cannon in the known world. Now, when I was there not\nlong since, the anecdote of Tott’s firing this tremendous piece was\nmentioned as a proof of that gentleman’s extraordinary courage.",
        "I was determined not to be outdone by a Frenchman, therefore took this\nvery piece upon my shoulder, and, after balancing it properly, jumped\ninto the sea with it, and swam to the opposite shore, from whence I\nunfortunately attempted to throw it back into its former place. I say\nunfortunately, for it slipped a little in my hand just as I was about\nto discharge it, and in consequence of that it fell into the middle of\nthe channel, where it now lies, without a prospect of ever recovering\nit: and notwithstanding the high favour I was in with the Grand\nSeignior, as before mentioned, this cruel Turk, as soon as he heard of\nthe loss of his famous piece of ordnance, issued an order to cut off\nmy head. I was immediately informed of it by one of the Sultanas, with\nwhom I was become a great favourite, and she secreted me in her\napartment while the officer charged with my execution was, with his\nassistants, in search of me.",
        "That very night I made my escape on board a vessel bound to Venice,\nwhich was then weighing anchor to proceed on her voyage.",
        "The last story, gentlemen, I am not fond of mentioning, as I\nmiscarried in the attempt, and was very near losing my life into the\nbargain: however, as it contains no impeachment of my honour, I would\nnot withhold it from you.",

        "His reputed father was a native of Berne, in Switzerland; his\nprofession was that of a surveyor of the streets, lanes, and alleys,\nvulgarly called a scavenger. His mother was a native of the mountains\nof Savoy, and had a most beautiful large wen on her neck, common to\nboth sexes in that part of the world; she left her parents when young,\nand sought her fortune in the same city which gave his father birth;\nshe maintained herself while single by acts of kindness to our sex,\nfor she never was known to refuse them any favour they asked, provided\nthey did but pay her some compliment beforehand. This lovely couple\nmet by accident in the street, in consequence of their being both\nintoxicated, for by reeling to one centre they threw each other down;\nthis created mutual abuse, in which they were complete adepts; they\nwere both carried to the watch-house, and afterwards to the house of\ncorrection; they soon saw the folly of quarrelling, made it up, became\nfond of each other, and married; but madam returning to her old\ntricks, his father, who had high notions of honour, soon separated\nhimself from her; she then joined a family who strolled about with a\npuppet-show. In time she arrived at Rome, where she kept an oyster-\nstand. You have all heard, no doubt of Pope Ganganelli, commonly\ncalled Clement XIV.: he was remarkably fond of oysters. One Good\nFriday, as he was passing through this famous city in state, to assist\nat high mass at St. Peter’s Church, he saw this woman’s oysters (which\nwere remarkably fine and fresh); he could not proceed without tasting\nthem. There were about five thousand people in his train; he ordered\nthem all to stop, and sent word to the church he could not attend mass\ntill next day; then alighting from his horse (for the Pope always\nrides on horseback upon these occasions) he went into her stall, and\nate every oyster she had there, and afterwards retired into the cellar\nwhere she had a few more. This subterraneous apartment was her\nkitchen, parlour, and bed-chamber. He liked his situation so much that\nhe discharged all his attendants, and to make short of the story, His\nHoliness passed the whole night there! Before they parted he gave her\nabsolution, not only for every sin she had, but all she might\nhereafter commit.",
        "Now, gentlemen, I have his mother’s word for it (and her honour\ncannot be doubted), that Baron Tott is the fruit of that amour. When\nTott was born, his mother applied to His Holiness, as the father of\nher child; he immediately placed him under the proper people, and as\nhe grew up gave him a gentleman’s education, had him taught the use of\narms, procured him promotion in France, and a title, and when he died\nhe left him a good estate.",

        "“On my arrival,” says my father, “at Helvoetsluys, I was observed to\nbreathe with some difficulty; upon the inhabitants inquiring into the\ncause, I informed them that the animal upon whose back I rode from\nHarwich across to their shore did not swim! Such is their peculiar\nform and disposition, that they cannot float or move upon the surface\nof the water; he ran with incredible swiftness upon the sands from the\nshore, driving fish in millions before him, many of which were quite\ndifferent from any I had yet seen, carrying their heads at the\nextremity of their tails. I crossed,” continued he, “one prodigious\nrange of rocks, equal in height to the Alps (the tops or highest parts\nof these marine mountains are said to be upwards of one hundred\nfathoms below the surface of the sea), on the sides of which there was\na great variety of tall, noble trees, loaded with marine fruit, such\nas lobsters, crabs, oysters, scollops, mussels, cockles, &c. &c.; some\nof which were a cart-load singly! and none less than a porter’s! All\nthose which are brought on shore and sold in our markets are of an\ninferior dwarf kind, or, properly, waterfalls, i.e., fruit shook off\nthe branches of the tree it grows upon by the motion of the water, as\nthose in our gardens are by that of the wind! The lobster-trees\nappeared the richest, but the crab and oysters were the tallest. The\nperiwinkle is a kind of shrub; it grows at the foot of the oyster-\ntree, and twines round it as the ivy does the oak. I observed the\neffect of several accidents by shipwreck, &c., particularly a ship\nthat had been wrecked by striking against a mountain or rock, the top\nof which lay within three fathoms of the surface. As she sank she fell\nupon her side, and forced a very large lobster-tree out of its place.\nIt was in the spring, when the lobsters were very young, and many of\nthem being separated by the violence of the shock, they fell upon a\ncrab-tree which was growing below them; they have, like the farina of\nplants, united, and produced a fish resembling both. I endeavoured to\nbring one with me, but it was too cumbersome, and my salt-water\nPegasus seemed much displeased at every attempt to stop his career\nwhilst I continued upon his back; besides, I was then, though\ngalloping over a mountain of rocks that lay about midway the passage,\nat least five hundred fathom below the surface of the sea, and began\nto find the want of air inconvenient, therefore I had no inclination\nto prolong the time. Add to this, my situation was in other respects\nvery unpleasant; I met many large fish, who were, if I could judge by\ntheir open mouths, not only able, but really wished to devour us; now,\nas my Rosinante was blind, I had these hungry gentlemen’s attempts to\nguard against, in addition to my other difficulties.",
        "“As we drew near the Dutch shore, and the body of water over our heads\ndid not exceed twenty fathoms, I thought I saw a human figure in a\nfemale dress then lying on the sand before me with some signs of life;\nwhen I came close I perceived her hand move: I took it into mine, and\nbrought her on shore as a corpse. An apothecary, who had just been\ninstructed by Dr. Hawes [the Baron’s father must have lived very\nlately if Dr. Hawes was his preceptor], of London, treated her\nproperly, and she recovered. She was the rib of a man who commanded a\nvessel belonging to Helvoetsluys. He was just going out of port on a\nvoyage, when she, hearing he had got a mistress with him, followed him\nin an open boat. As soon as she had got on the quarter-deck she flew\nat her husband, and attempted to strike him with such impetuosity,\nthat he thought it most prudent to slip on one side, and let her make\nthe impression of her fingers upon the waves rather than his face: he\nwas not much out in his ideas of the consequence; for meeting no\nopposition, she went directly overboard, and it was my unfortunate lot\nto lay the foundation for bringing this happy pair together again.",
        "“I can easily conceive what execrations the husband loaded me with\nwhen, on his return, he found this gentle creature waiting his\narrival, and learned the means by which she came into the world again.\nHowever, great as the injury is which I have done this poor devil, I\nhope he will die in charity with me, as my motive was good, though the\nconsequences to him are, it must be confessed, horrible.”",
        "  This is a very short chapter, but contains a fact for which the\n  Baron’s memory ought to be dear to every Englishman, especially\n  those who may hereafter have the misfortune of being made\n  prisoners of war.",
        "On my return from Gibraltar I travelled by way of France to England.\nBeing a foreigner, this was not attended with any inconvenience to me.\nI found, in the harbour of Calais, a ship just arrived with a number\nof English sailors as prisoners of war. I immediately conceived an\nidea of giving these brave fellows their liberty, which I accomplished\nas follows:–After forming a pair of large wings, each of them forty\nyards long, and fourteen wide, and annexing them to myself, I mounted\nat break of day, when every creature, even the watch upon deck, was\nfast asleep. As I hovered over the ship I fastened three grappling\nirons to the tops of the three masts with my sling, and fairly lifted\nher several yards out of the water, and then proceeded across to\nDover, where I arrived in half an hour! Having no further occasion for\nthese wings, I made them a present to the governor of Dover Castle,\nwhere they are now exhibited to the curious.",
        "As to the prisoners, and the Frenchmen who guarded them, they did not\nawake till they had been near two hours on Dover Pier. The moment the\nEnglish understood their situation they changed places with their\nguard, and took back what they had been plundered of, but no more, for\nthey were too generous to retaliate and plunder them in return.",

        "In a voyage which I made to the East Indies with Captain Hamilton, I\ntook a favourite pointer with me; he was, to use a common phrase,\nworth his weight in gold, for he never deceived me. One day when we\nwere, by the best observations we could make, at least three hundred\nleagues from land, my dog pointed; I observed him for near an hour\nwith astonishment, and mentioned the circumstance to the captain and\nevery officer on board, asserting that we must be near land, for my\ndog smelt game. This occasioned a general laugh; but that did not\nalter in the least the good opinion I had of my dog. After much\nconversation pro and con, I boldly told the captain I placed more\nconfidence in Tray’s nose than I did in the eyes of every seaman on\nboard, and therefore proposed laying the sum I had agreed to pay for\nmy passage (viz., one hundred guineas) that we should find game within\nhalf an hour. The captain (a good, hearty fellow) laughed again,\ndesired Mr. Crowford the surgeon, who was prepared, to feel my pulse;\nhe did so, and reported me in perfect health. The following dialogue\nbetween them took place; I overheard it, though spoken low, and at\nsome distance.",
        "CAPTAIN\nHis brain is turned; I cannot with honour accept his wager.",
        "SURGEON\nI am of a different opinion; he is quite sane, and depends more upon\nthe scent of his dog than he will upon the judgment of all the\nofficers on board; he will certainly lose, and he richly merits it.",
        "CAPTAIN\nSuch a wager cannot be fair on my side; however, I’ll take him up, if\nI return his money afterwards.",
        "During the above conversation Tray continued in the same situation,\nand confirmed me still more in my former opinion. I proposed the wager\na second time, it was then accepted.",
        "Done! and done! were scarcely said on both sides, when some sailors\nwho were fishing in the long-boat, which was made fast to the stern of\nthe ship, harpooned an exceeding large shark, which they brought on\nboard and began to cut up for the purpose of barrelling the oil, when,\nbehold, they found no less than six brace of live partridges in this\nanimal’s stomach!",
        "They had been so long in that situation, that one of the hens was\nsitting upon four eggs, and a fifth was hatching when the shark was\nopened!!! This young bird we brought up by placing it with a litter of\nkittens that came into the world a few minutes before! The old cat was\nas fond of it as of any of her own four-legged progeny, and made\nherself very unhappy, when it flew out of her reach, till it returned\nagain. As to the other partridges, there were four hens amongst them;\none or more were, during the voyage, constantly sitting, and\nconsequently we had plenty of game at the captain’s table; and in\ngratitude to poor Tray (for being a means of winning one hundred\nguineas) I ordered him the bones daily, and sometimes a whole bird.",

        "  A second visit (but an accidental one) to the moon–The ship\n  driven by a whirlwind a thousand leagues above the surface of the\n  water, where a new atmosphere meets them and carries them into a\n  capacious harbour in the moon–A description of the inhabitants,\n  and their manner of coming into the lunarian world–Animals,\n  customs, weapons of war, wine, vegetables, &c.",
        "I have already informed you of one trip I made to the moon, in search\nof my silver hatchet; I afterwards made another in a much pleasanter\nmanner, and stayed in it long enough to take notice of several things,\nwhich I will endeavour to describe as accurately as my memory will\npermit.",
        "I went on a voyage of discovery at the request of a distant relation,\nwho had a strange notion that there were people to be found equal in\nmagnitude to those described by Gulliver in the empire of BROBDIGNAG.\nFor my part I always treated that account as fabulous: however, to\noblige him, for he had made me his heir, I undertook it, and sailed\nfor the South seas, where we arrived without meeting with anything\nremarkable, except some flying men and women who were playing at leap-\nfrog, and dancing minuets in the air.",
        "On the eighteenth day after we had passed the Island of Otaheite,\nmentioned by Captain Cook as the place from whence they brought Omai,\na hurricane blew our ship at least one thousand leagues above the\nsurface of the water, and kept it at the height till a fresh gale\narising filled the sails in every part, and onwards we travelled at a\nprodigious rate; thus we proceeded above the clouds for six weeks. At\nlast we discovered a great land in the sky, like a shining island,\nround and bright, where, coming into a convenient harbour, we went on\nshore, and soon found it was inhabited. Below us we saw another earth,\ncontaining cities, trees, mountains, rivers, seas, &c., which we\nconjectured was this world which we had left. Here we saw huge figures\nriding upon vultures of a prodigious size, and each of them having\nthree heads. To form some idea of the magnitude of these birds, I must\ninform you that each of their wings is as wide and six times the\nlength of the main sheet of our vessel, which was about six hundred\ntons burthen. Thus, instead of riding upon horses, as we do in this\nworld, the inhabitants of the moon (for we now found we were in Madam\nLuna) fly about on these birds. The king, we found, was engaged in a\nwar with the sun, and he offered me a commission, but I declined the\nhonour his majesty intended me. Everything in this world is of\nextraordinary magnitude! a common flea being much larger than one of\nour sheep: in making war, their principal weapons are radishes, which\nare used as darts: those who are wounded by them die immediately.\nTheir shields are made of mushrooms, and their darts (when radishes\nare out of season) of the tops of asparagus. Some of the natives of\nthe dog-star are to be seen here; commerce tempts them to ramble;\ntheir faces are like large mastiffs’, with their eyes near the lower\nend or tip of their noses: they have no eyelids, but cover their eyes\nwith the end of their tongues when they go to sleep; they are\ngenerally twenty feet high. As to the natives of the moon, none of\nthem are less in stature than thirty-six feet: they are not called the\nhuman species, but the cooking animals, for they all dress their food\nby fire, as we do, but lose not time at their meals, as they open\ntheir left side, and place the whole quantity at once in their\nstomach, then shut it again till the same day in the next month; for\nthey never indulge themselves with food more than twelve times a year,\nor once a month. All but gluttons and epicures must prefer this method\nto ours.",
        "There is but one sex either of the cooking or any other animals in the\nmoon; they are all produced from trees of various sizes and foliage;\nthat which produces the cooking animal, or human species, is much more\nbeautiful than any of the others; it has large straight boughs and\nflesh-coloured leaves, and the fruit it produces are nuts or pods,\nwith hard shells at least two yards long; when they become ripe, which\nis known from their changing colour, they are gathered with great\ncare, and laid by as long as they think proper: when they choose to\nanimate the seed of these nuts, they throw them into a large cauldron\nof boiling water, which opens the shells in a few hours, and out jumps\nthe creature.",
        "Nature forms their minds for different pursuits before they come into\nthe world; from one shell comes forth a warrior, from another a\nphilosopher, from a third a divine, from a fourth a lawyer, from a\nfifth a farmer, from a sixth a clown, &c. &c., and each of them\nimmediately begins to perfect themselves, by practising what they\nbefore knew only in theory.",
        "When they grow old they do not die, but turn into air, and dissolve\nlike smoke! As for their drink, they need none; the only evacuations\nthey have are insensible, and by their breath. They have but one\nfinger upon each hand, with which they perform everything in as\nperfect a manner as we do who have four besides the thumb. Their heads\nare placed under their right arm, and when are going to travel, or\nabout any violent exercise, they generally leave them at home, for\nthey can consult them at any distance; this is a very common practice;\nand when those of rank or quality among the Lunarians have an\ninclination to see what’s going forward among the common people, they\nstay at home, i.e., the body stays at home, and sends the head only,\nwhich is suffered to be present incog., and return at pleasure with\nan account of what has passed.",
        "The stones of their grapes are exactly like hail; and I am perfectly\nsatisfied that when a storm or high wind in the moon shakes their\nvines, and breaks the grapes from the stalks, the stones fall down and\nform our hail showers. I would advise those who are of my opinion to\nsave a quantity of these stones when it hails next, and make Lunarian\nwine. It is a common beverage at St. Luke’s. Some material\ncircumstances I had nearly omitted. They put their bellies to the same\nuse as we do a sack, and throw whatever they have occasion for into\nit, for they can shut and open it again when they please, as they do\ntheir stomachs; they are not troubled with bowels, liver, heart, or\nany other intestines, neither are they encumbered with clothes, nor is\nthere any part of their bodies unseemly or indecent to exhibit.",
        "Their eyes they can take in and out of their places when they please,\nand can see as well with them in their hand as in their head! and if\nby any accident they lose or damage one, they can borrow or purchase\nanother, and see as clearly with it as their own. Dealers in eyes are\non that account very numerous in most parts of the moon, and in this\narticle alone all the inhabitants are whimsical: sometimes green and\nsometimes yellow eyes are the fashion. I know these things appear\nstrange; but if the shadow of a doubt can remain on any person’s mind,\nI say, let him take a voyage there himself, and then he will know I am\na traveller of veracity.",

        "My first visit to England was about the beginning of the present\nking’s reign. I had occasion to go down to Wapping, to see some goods\nshipped, which I was sending to some friends at Hamburgh; after that\nbusiness was over, I took the Tower Wharf in my way back. Here I found\nthe sun very powerful, and I was so much fatigued that I stepped into\none of the cannon to compose me, where I fell fast asleep. This was\nabout noon: it was the fourth of June; exactly at one o’clock these\ncannon were all discharged in memory of the day. They had been all\ncharged that morning, and having no suspicion of my situation, I was\nshot over the houses on the opposite side of the river, into a\nfarmer’s yard, between Bermondsey and Deptford, where I fell upon a\nlarge hay-stack, without waking, and continued there in a sound sleep\ntill hay became so extravagantly dear (which was about three months\nafter), that the farmer found it his interest to send his whole stock\nto market: the stack I was reposing upon was the largest in the yard,\ncontaining above five hundred load; they began to cut that first. I\nwoke with the voices of the people who had ascended the ladders to\nbegin at the top, and got up, totally ignorant of my situation: in\nattempting to run away I fell upon the farmer to whom the hay\nbelonged, and broke his neck, yet received no injury myself. I\nafterwards found, to my great consolation, that this fellow was a most\ndetestable character, always keeping the produce of his grounds for\nextravagant markets.",

        "Mr. Drybones’ “Travels to Sicily,” which I had read with great\npleasure, induced me to pay a visit to Mount Etna; my voyage to this\nplace was not attended with any circumstances worth relating. One\nmorning early, three or four days after my arrival, I set out from a\ncottage where I had slept, within six miles of the foot of the\nmountain, determined to explore the internal parts, if I perished in\nthe attempt. After three hours’ hard labour I found myself at the top;\nit was then, and had been for upwards of three weeks, raging: its\nappearance in this state has been so frequently noticed by different\ntravellers, that I will not tire you with descriptions of objects you\nare already acquainted with. I walked round the edge of the crater,\nwhich appeared to be fifty times at least as capacious as the Devil’s\nPunch-Bowl near Petersfield, on the Portsmouth Road, but not so broad\nat the bottom, as in that part it resembles the contracted part of a\nfunnel more than a punch-bowl. At last, having made up my mind, in I\nsprang feet foremost; I soon found myself in a warm berth, and my body\nbruised and burnt in various parts by the red-hot cinders, which, by\ntheir violent ascent, opposed my descent: however, my weight soon\nbrought me to the bottom, where I found myself in the midst of noise\nand clamour, mixed with the most horrid imprecations; after recovering\nmy senses, and feeling a reduction of my pain, I began to look about\nme. Guess, gentlemen, my astonishment, when I found myself in the\ncompany of Vulcan and his Cyclops, who had been quarrelling, for the\nthree weeks before mentioned, about the observation of good order and\ndue subordination, and which had occasioned such alarms for that space\nof time in the world above. However, my arrival restored peace to the\nwhole society, and Vulcan himself did me the honour of applying\nplasters to my wounds, which healed them immediately; he also placed\nrefreshments before me, particularly nectar, and other rich wines,\nsuch as the gods and goddesses only aspire to. After this repast was\nover Vulcan ordered Venus to show me every indulgence which my\nsituation required. To describe the apartment, and the couch on which\nI reposed, is totally impossible, therefore I will not attempt it; let\nit suffice to say, it exceeds the power of language to do it justice,\nor speak of that kind-hearted goddess in any terms equal to her merit.",
        "Vulcan gave me a very concise account of Mount Etna: he said it was\nnothing more than an accumulation of ashes thrown from his forge; that\nhe was frequently obliged to chastise his people, at whom, in his\npassion, he made it a practice to throw red-hot coals at home, which\nthey often parried with great dexterity, and then threw them up into\nthe world to place them out of his reach, for they never attempted to\nassault him in return by throwing them back again. “Our quarrels,\"\nadded he, “last sometimes three or four months, and these appearances\nof coals or cinders in the world are what I find you mortals call\neruptions.” Mount Vesuvius, he assured me, was another of his shops,\nto which he had a passage three hundred and fifty leagues under the\nbed of the sea, where similar quarrels produced similar eruptions. I\nshould have continued here as an humble attendant upon Madam Venus,\nbut some busy tattlers, who delight in mischief, whispered a tale in\nVulcan’s ear, which roused in him a fit of jealousy not to be\nappeased. Without the least previous notice he took me one morning\nunder his arm, as I was waiting upon Venus, agreeable to custom, and\ncarried me to an apartment I had never before seen, in which there\nwas, to all appearance, a well with a wide mouth: over this he held\nme at arm’s length, and saying, “Ungrateful mortal, return to the\nworld from whence you came,” without giving me the least opportunity\nof reply, dropped me in the centre. I found myself descending with an\nincreasing rapidity, till the horror of my mind deprived me of all\nreflection. I suppose I fell into a trance, from which I was suddenly\naroused by plunging into a large body of water illuminated by the rays\nof the sun!!",
        "I could, from my infancy, swim well, and play tricks in the water. I\nnow found myself in paradise, considering the horrors of mind I had\njust been released from. After looking about me some time, I could\ndiscover nothing but an expanse of sea, extending beyond the eye in\nevery direction; I also found it very cold, a different climate from\nMaster Vulcan’s shop. At last I observed at some distance a body of\namazing magnitude, like a huge rock, approaching me; I soon discovered\nit to be a piece of floating ice; I swam round it till I found a place\nwhere I could ascend to the top, which I did, but not without some\ndifficulty. Still I was out of sight of land, and despair returned\nwith double force; however, before night came on I saw a sail, which\nwe approached very fast; when it was within a very small distance I\nhailed them in German; they answered in Dutch. I then flung myself\ninto the sea, and they threw out a rope, by which I was taken on\nboard. I now inquired where we were, and was informed, in the great\nSouthern Ocean; this opened a discovery which removed all my doubts\nand difficulties. It was now evident that I had passed from Mount Etna\nthrough the centre of the earth to the South Seas: this, gentlemen,\nwas a much shorter cut than going round the world, and which no man\nhas accomplished, or ever attempted, but myself; however, the next\ntime I perform it I will be much more particular in my observations.",
        "I took some refreshment, and went to rest. The Dutch are a very rude\nsort of people; I related the Etna passage to the officers, exactly as\nI have done to you, and some of them, particularly the Captain, seemed\nby his grimace and half-sentence to doubt my veracity; however, as he\nhad kindly taken me on board his vessel, and was then in the very act\nof administering to my necessities, I pocketed the affront.",
        "I now in my turn began to inquire where they were bound? To which they\nanswered, they were in search of new discoveries; “and if,” said\nthey, “your story is true, a new passage is really discovered, and we\nshall not return disappointed.” We were now exactly in Captain Cook’s\nfirst track, and arrived the next morning in Botany Bay. This place I\nwould by no means recommend to the English government as a receptacle\nfor felons, or place of punishment; it should rather be the reward of\nmerit, nature having most bountifully bestowed her best gifts upon it.",
        "We stayed here but three days; the fourth after our departure a most\ndreadful storm arose, which in a few hours destroyed all our sails,\nsplintered our bowsprit, and brought down our topmast; it fell\ndirectly upon the box that enclosed our compass, which, with the\ncompass, was broken to pieces. Every one who has been at sea knows the\nconsequences of such a misfortune: we now were at a loss where to\nsteer. At length the storm abated, which was followed by a steady,\nbrisk gale, that carried us at least forty knots an hour for six\nmonths! [we should suppose the Baron has made a little mistake, and\nsubstituted months for days] when we began to observe an amazing\nchange in everything about us: our spirits became light, our noses\nwere regaled with the most aromatic effluvia imaginable: the sea had\nalso changed its complexion, and from green became white!! Soon after\nthese wonderful alterations we saw land, and not at any great distance\nan inlet, which we sailed up near sixty leagues, and found it wide and\ndeep, flowing with milk of the most delicious taste. Here we landed,\nand soon found it was an island consisting of one large cheese: we\ndiscovered this by one of the company fainting away as soon as we\nlanded: this man always had an aversion to cheese; when he recovered,\nhe desired the cheese to be taken from under his feet: upon\nexamination we found him perfectly right, for the whole island, as\nbefore observed, was nothing but a cheese of immense magnitude! Upon\nthis the inhabitants, who are amazingly numerous, principally sustain\nthemselves, and it grows every night in proportion as it is consumed\nin the day. Here seemed to be plenty of vines, with bunches of large\ngrapes, which, upon being pressed, yielded nothing but milk. We saw\nthe inhabitants running races upon the surface of the milk: they were\nupright, comely figures, nine feet high, have three legs, and but one\narm; upon the whole, their form was graceful, and when they quarrel,\nthey exercise a straight horn, which grows in adults from the centre\nof their foreheads, with great adroitness; they did not sink at all,\nbut ran and walked upon the surface of the milk, as we do upon a\nbowling-green.",
        "Upon this island of cheese grows great plenty of corn, the ears of\nwhich produce loaves of bread, ready made, of a round form like\nmushrooms. We discovered, in our rambles over this cheese, seventeen\nother rivers of milk, and ten of wine.",
        "After thirty-eight days’ journey we arrived on the opposite side to\nthat on which we landed: here we found some blue mould, as cheese-\neaters call it, from whence spring all kinds of rich fruit; instead of\nbreeding mites it produced peaches, nectarines, apricots, and a\nthousand delicious fruits which we are not acquainted with. In these\ntrees, which are of an amazing size, were plenty of birds’ nests;\namongst others was a king-fisher’s of prodigious magnitude; it was at\nleast twice the circumference of the dome of St. Paul’s Church in\nLondon. Upon inspection, this nest was made of huge trees curiously\njoined together; there were, let me see (for I make it a rule always\nto speak within compass), there were upwards of five hundred eggs in\nthe nest, and each of them was as large as four common hogsheads, or\neight barrels, and we could not only see, but hear the young ones\nchirping within. Having, with great fatigue, cut open one of these\neggs, we let out a young one unfeathered, considerably larger than\ntwenty full-grown vultures. Just as we had given this youngster his\nliberty the old kingfisher lighted, and seizing our captain, who had\nbeen active in breaking the egg, in one of her claws, flew with him\nabove a mile high, and then let him drop into the sea, but not till\nshe had beaten all his teeth out of his mouth with her wings.",
        "Dutchmen generally swim well: he soon joined us, and we retreated to\nour ship. On our return we took a different route, and observed many\nstrange objects. We shot two wild oxen, each with one horn, also like\nthe inhabitants, except that it sprouted from between the eyes of\nthese animals; we were afterwards concerned at having destroyed them,\nas we found, by inquiry, they tamed these creatures, and used them as\nwe do horses, to ride upon and draw their carriages; their flesh, we\nwere informed, is excellent, but useless where people live upon cheese\nand milk. When we had reached within two days’ journey of the ship we\nobserved three men hanging to a tall tree by their heels; upon\ninquiring the cause of their punishment, I found they had all been\ntravellers, and upon their return home had deceived their friends by\ndescribing places they never saw, and relating things that never\nhappened: this gave me no concern, as I have ever confined myself to\nfacts.",
        "As soon as we arrived at the ship we unmoored, and set sail from this\nextraordinary country, when, to our astonishment, all the trees upon\nshore, of which there were a great number very tall and large, paid\ntheir respects to us twice, bowing to exact time, and immediately\nrecovered their former posture, which was quite erect.",
        "By what we could learn of this CHEESE, it was considerably larger than\nthe continent of all Europe!",
        "After sailing three months we knew not where, being still without\ncompass, we arrived in a sea which appeared to be almost black: upon\ntasting it we found it most excellent wine, and had great difficulty\nto keep the sailors from getting drunk with it: however, in a few\nhours we found ourselves surrounded by whales and other animals of an\nimmense magnitude, one of which appeared to be too large for the eye\nto form a judgment of: we did not see him till we were close to him.\nThis monster drew our ship, with all her masts standing, and sails\nbent, by suction into his mouth, between his teeth, which were much\nlarger and taller than the mast of a first-rate man-of-war. After we\nhad been in his mouth some time he opened it pretty wide, took in an\nimmense quantity of water, and floated our vessel, which was at least\n500 tons burthen, into his stomach; here we lay as quiet as at anchor\nin a dead calm. The air, to be sure, was rather warm, and very\noffensive. We found anchors, cables, boats, and barges in abundance,\nand a considerable number of ships, some laden and some not, which\nthis creature had swallowed. Everything was transacted by torch-light;\nno sun, no moon, no planet, to make observations from. We were all\ngenerally afloat and aground twice a-day; whenever he drank, it became\nhigh water with us; and when he evacuated, we found ourselves aground;\nupon a moderate computation, he took in more water at a single draught\nthan is generally to be found in the Lake of Geneva, though that is\nabove thirty miles in circumference. On the second day of our\nconfinement in these regions of darkness, I ventured at low water, as\nwe called it when the ship was aground, to ramble with the Captain,\nand a few of the other officers, with lights in our hands; we met with\npeople of all nations, to the amount of upwards of ten thousand; they\nwere going to hold a council how to recover their liberty; some of\nthem having lived in this animal’s stomach several years; there were\nseveral children here who had never seen the world, their mothers\nhaving lain in repeatedly in this warm situation. Just as the chairman\nwas going to inform us of the business upon which we were assembled,\nthis plaguy fish, becoming thirsty, drank in his usual manner; the\nwater poured in with such impetuosity, that we were all obliged to\nretreat to our respective ships immediately, or run the risk of being\ndrowned; some were obliged to swim for it, and with difficulty saved\ntheir lives. In a few hours after we were more fortunate, we met again\njust after the monster had evacuated. I was chosen chairman, and the\nfirst thing I did was to propose splicing two main-masts together, and\nthe next time he opened his mouth to be ready to wedge them in, so as\nto prevent his shutting it. It was unanimously approved. One hundred\nstout men were chosen upon this service. We had scarcely got our masts\nproperly prepared when an opportunity offered; the monster opened his\nmouth, immediately the top of the mast was placed against the roof,\nand the other end pierced his tongue, which effectually prevented him\nfrom shutting his mouth. As soon as everything in his stomach was\nafloat, we manned a few boats, who rowed themselves and us into the\nworld. The daylight, after, as near as we could judge, three months’\nconfinement in total darkness, cheered our spirits surprisingly. When\nwe had all taken our leave of this capacious animal, we mustered just\na fleet of ninety-five ships, of all nations, who had been in this\nconfined situation.",
        "We left the two masts in his mouth, to prevent others being confined\nin the same horrid gulf of darkness and filth. Our first object was to\nlearn what part of the world we were in; this we were for some time at\na loss to ascertain: at last I found, from former observations, that\nwe were in the Caspian Sea! which washes part of the country of the\nCalmuck Tartars. How we came here is was impossible to conceive, as\nthis sea has no communication with any other. One of the inhabitants\nof the Cheese Island, whom I had brought with me, accounted for it\nthus:–that the monster in whose stomach we had been so long confined\nhad carried us here through some subterraneous passage; however, we\npushed to shore, and I was the first who landed. Just as I put my foot\nupon the ground a large bear leaped upon me with its fore-paws; I\ncaught one in each hand, and squeezed him till he cried out most\nlustily; however, in this position I held him till I starved him to\ndeath. You may laugh, gentlemen, but this was soon accomplished, as I\nprevented him licking his paws. From hence I travelled up to St.\nPetersburg a second time: here an old friend gave me a most excellent\npointer, descended from the famous bitch before-mentioned, that\nlittered while she was hunting a hare. I had the misfortune to have\nhim shot soon after by a blundering sportsman, who fired at him\ninstead of a covey of partridges which he had just set. Of this\ncreature’s skin I have had this waistcoat made (showing his\nwaistcoat), which always leads me involuntarily to game if I walk in\nthe fields in the proper season, and when I come within shot, one of\nthe buttons constantly flies off, and lodges upon the spot where the\nsport is; and as the birds rise, being always primed and cocked, I\nnever miss them. Here are now but three buttons left. I shall have a\nnew set sewed on against the shooting season commences.",
        "When a covey of partridges is disturbed in this manner, by the button\nfalling amongst them, they always rise from the ground in a direct\nline before each other. I one day, by forgetting to take my ramrod out\nof my gun, shot it straight through a leash, as regularly as if the\ncook had spitted them. I had forgot to put in any shot, and the rod\nhad been made so hot with the powder, that the birds were completely\nroasted by the time I reached home.",
        "Since my arrival in England I have accomplished what I had very much\nat heart, viz., providing for the inhabitant of the Cheese Island,\nwhom I had brought with me. My old friend, Sir William Chambers, who\nis entirely indebted to me for all his ideas of Chinese gardening, by\na description of which he has gained such high reputation; I say,\ngentlemen, in a discourse which I had with this gentlemen, he seemed\nmuch distressed for a contrivance to light the lamps at the new\nbuildings, Somerset House; the common mode with ladders, he observed,\nwas both dirty and inconvenient. My native of the Cheese Island popped\ninto my head; he was only nine feet high when I first brought him from\nhis own country, but was now increased to ten and a half: I introduced\nhim to Sir William, and he is appointed to that honourable office. He\nis also to carry, under a large cloak, a utensil in each coat pocket,\ninstead of those four which Sir William has very properly fixed for\nprivate purposes in so conspicuous a situation, the great quadrangle.",
        "He has also obtained from Mr. PITT the situation of messenger to his\nMajesty’s lords of the bed-chamber, whose principal employment will\nnow be, divulging the secrets of the Royal household to their\nworthy Patron.",
        "  Extraordinary flight on the back of an eagle, over France to\n  Gibraltar, South and North America, the Polar Regions, and back to\n  England, within six-and-thirty hours.",
        "About the beginning of his present Majesty’s reign I had some business\nwith a distant relation who then lived on the Isle of Thanet; it was a\nfamily dispute, and not likely to be finished soon. I made it a\npractice during my residence there, the weather being fine, to walk\nout every morning. After a few of these excursions I observed an\nobject upon a great eminence about three miles distant: I extended my\nwalk to it, and found the ruins of an ancient temple: I approached it\nwith admiration and astonishment; the traces of grandeur and\nmagnificence which yet remained were evident proofs of its former\nsplendour: here I could not help lamenting the ravages and\ndevastations of time, of which that once noble structure exhibited\nsuch a melancholy proof. I walked round it several times, meditating\non the fleeting and transitory nature of all terrestrial things; on\nthe eastern end were the remains of a lofty tower, near forty feet\nhigh, overgrown with ivy, the top apparently flat; I surveyed it on\nevery side very minutely, thinking that if I could gain its summit I\nshould enjoy the most delightful prospect of the circumjacent country.\nAnimated with this hope, I resolved, if possible, to gain the summit,\nwhich I at length effected by means of the ivy, though not without\ngreat difficulty and danger; the top I found covered with this\nevergreen, except a large chasm in the middle. After I had surveyed\nwith pleasing wonder the beauties of art and nature that conspired to\nenrich the scene, curiosity prompted me to sound the opening in the\nmiddle, in order to ascertain its depth, as I entertained a suspicion\nthat it might probably communicate with some unexplored subterranean\ncavern in the hill; but having no line I was at a loss how to proceed.\nAfter revolving the matter in my thoughts for some time, I resolved to\ndrop a stone down and listen to the echo: having found one that\nanswered my purpose I placed myself over the hole, with one foot on\neach side, and stooping down to listen, I dropped the stone, which I\nhad no sooner done than I heard a rustling below, and suddenly a\nmonstrous eagle put up its head right opposite my face, and rising up\nwith irresistible force, carried me away seated on its shoulders: I\ninstantly grasped it round the neck, which was large enough to fill my\narms, and its wings, when extended, were ten yards from one extremity\nto the other. As it rose with a regular ascent, my seat was perfectly\neasy, and I enjoyed the prospect below with inexpressible pleasure. It\nhovered over Margate for some time, was seen by several people, and\nmany shots were fired at it; one ball hit the heel of my shoe, but did\nme no injury. It then directed its course to Dover cliff, where it\nalighted, and I thought of dismounting, but was prevented by a sudden\ndischarge of musketry from a party of marines that were exercising on\nthe beach; the balls flew about my head, and rattled on the feathers\nof the eagle like hail-stones, yet I could not perceive it had\nreceived any injury. It instantly reascended and flew over the sea\ntowards Calais, but so very high that the Channel seemed to be no\nbroader than the Thames at London Bridge. In a quarter of an hour I\nfound myself over a thick wood in France, where the eagle descended\nvery rapidly, which caused me to slip down to the back part of its\nhead; but alighting on a large tree, and raising its head, I recovered\nmy seat as before, but saw no possibility of disengaging myself\nwithout the danger of being killed by the fall; so I determined to sit\nfast, thinking it would carry me to the Alps, or some other high\nmountain, where I could dismount without any danger. After resting a\nfew minutes it took wing, flew several times round the wood, and\nscreamed loud enough to be heard across the English Channel. In a few\nminutes one of the same species arose out of the wood, and flew\ndirectly towards us; it surveyed me with evident marks of displeasure,\nand came very near me. After flying several times round, they both\ndirected their course to the south-west. I soon observed that the one\nI rode upon could not keep pace with the other, but inclined towards\nthe earth, on account of my weight; its companion perceiving this,\nturned round and placed itself in such a position that the other could\nrest its head on its rump; in this manner they proceeded till noon,\nwhen I saw the rock of Gibraltar very distinctly. The day being clear,\nnotwithstanding my degree of elevation, the earth’s surface appeared\njust like a map, where land, sea, lakes, rivers, mountains, and the\nlike were perfectly distinguishable; and having some knowledge of\ngeography, I was at no loss to determine what part of the globe I was\nin.",
        "Whilst I was contemplating this wonderful prospect a dreadful howling\nsuddenly began all around me, and in a moment I was invested by\nthousands of small, black, deformed, frightful looking creatures, who\npressed me on all sides in such a manner that I could neither move\nhand or foot: but I had not been in their possession more than ten\nminutes when I heard the most delightful music that can possibly be\nimagined, which was suddenly changed into a noise the most awful and\ntremendous, to which the report of cannon, or the loudest claps of\nthunder could bear no more proportion than the gentle zephyrs of the\nevening to the most dreadful hurricane; but the shortness of its\nduration prevented all those fatal effects which a prolongation of it\nwould certainly have been attended with.",
        "The music commenced, and I saw a great number of the most beautiful\nlittle creatures seize the other party, and throw them with great\nviolence into something like a snuff-box, which they shut down, and\none threw it away with incredible velocity; then turning to me, he\nsaid they whom he had secured were a party of devils, who had wandered\nfrom their proper habitation; and that the vehicle in which they were\nenclosed would fly with unabating rapidity for ten thousand years,\nwhen it would burst of its own accord, and the devils would recover\ntheir liberty and faculties, as at the present moment. He had no\nsooner finished this relation than the music ceased, and they all\ndisappeared, leaving me in a state of mind bordering on the confines\nof despair.",
        "When I had recomposed myself a little, and looking before me with\ninexpressible pleasure, I observed that the eagles were preparing to\nlight on the peak of Teneriffe: they descended on the top of the rock,\nbut seeing no possible means of escape if I dismounted determined me\nto remain where I was. The eagles sat down seemingly fatigued, when\nthe heat of the sun soon caused them both to fall asleep, nor did I\nlong resist its fascinating power. In the cool of the evening, when\nthe sun had retired below the horizon, I was roused from sleep by the\neagle moving under me; and having stretched myself along its back, I\nsat up, and reassumed my travelling position, when they both took\nwing, and having placed themselves as before, directed their course to\nSouth America. The moon shining bright during the whole night, I had a\nfine view of all the islands in those seas.",
        "About the break of day we reached the great continent of America, that\npart called Terra Firma, and descended on the top of a very high\nmountain. At this time the moon, far distant in the west, and obscured\nby dark clouds, but just afforded light sufficient for me to discover\na kind of shrubbery all around, bearing fruit something like cabbages,\nwhich the eagles began to feed on very eagerly. I endeavoured to\ndiscover my situation, but fogs and passing clouds involved me in the\nthickest darkness, and what rendered the scene still more shocking was\nthe tremendous howling of wild beasts, some of which appeared to be\nvery near: however, I determined to keep my seat, imagining that the\neagle would carry me away if any of them should make a hostile\nattempt. When daylight began to appear, I thought of examining the\nfruit which I had seen the eagles eat, and as some was hanging which I\ncould easily come at, I took out my knife and cut a slice; but how\ngreat was my surprise to see that it had all the appearance of roast\nbeef regularly mixed, both fat and lean! I tasted it, and found it\nwell flavoured and delicious, then cut several large slices and put in\nmy pocket, where I found a crust of bread which I had brought from\nMargate; took it out, and found three musket-balls that had been\nlodged in it on Dover cliff. I extracted them, and cutting a few\nslices more, made a hearty meal of bread and cold beef fruit. I then\ncut down two of the largest that grew near me, and tying them together\nwith one of my garters, hung them over the eagle’s neck for another\noccasion, filling my pockets at the same time. While I was settling\nthese affairs I observed a large fruit like an inflated bladder, which\nI wished to try an experiment upon: and striking my knife into one of\nthem, a fine pure liquor like Hollands gin rushed out, which the\neagles observing, eagerly drank up from the ground. I cut down the\nbladder as fast as I could, and saved about half a pint in the bottom\nof it, which I tasted, and could not distinguish it from the best\nmountain wine. I drank it all, and found myself greatly refreshed. By\nthis time the eagles began to stagger against the shrubs. I\nendeavoured to keep my seat, but was soon thrown to some distance\namong the bushes. In attempting to rise I put my hand upon a large\nhedgehog, which happened to lie among the grass upon its back: it\ninstantly closed round my hand, so that I found it impossible to shake\nit off. I struck it several times against the ground without effect;\nbut while I was thus employed I heard a rustling among the shrubbery,\nand looking up, I saw a huge animal within three yards of me; I could\nmake no defence, but held out both my hands, when it rushed upon me,\nand seized that on which the hedgehog was fixed. My hand being soon\nrelieved, I ran to some distance, where I saw the creature suddenly\ndrop down and expire with the hedgehog in its throat. When the danger\nwas past I went to view the eagles, and found them lying on the grass\nfast asleep, being intoxicated with the liquor they had drank. Indeed,\nI found myself considerably elevated by it, and seeing everything\nquiet, I began to search for some more, which I soon found; and having\ncut down two large bladders, about a gallon each, I tied them\ntogether, and hung them over the neck of the other eagle, and the two\nsmaller ones I tied with a cord round my own waist. Having secured a\ngood stock of provisions, and perceiving the eagles begin to recover,\nI again took my seat. In half an hour they arose majestically from the\nplace, without taking the least notice of their incumbrance. Each\nreassumed its former station; and directing their course to the\nnorthward, they crossed the Gulf of Mexico, entered North America, and\nsteered directly for the Polar regions, which gave me the finest\nopportunity of viewing this vast continent that can possibly be\nimagined.",
        "Before we entered the frigid zone the cold began to affect me; but\npiercing one of my bladders, I took a draught, and found that it could\nmake no impression on me afterwards. Passing over Hudson’s Bay, I saw\nseveral of the Company’s ships lying at anchor, and many tribes of\nIndians marching with their furs to market.",
        "By this time I was so reconciled to my seat, and become such an expert\nrider, that I could sit up and look around me; but in general I lay\nalong the eagle’s neck, grasping it in my arms, with my hands immersed\nin its feathers, in order to keep them warm.",
        "In those cold climates I observed that the eagles flew with greater\nrapidity, in order, I suppose, to keep their blood in circulation. In\npassing Baffin’s Bay I saw several large Greenlandmen to the eastward,\nand many surprising mountains of ice in those seas.",
        "While I was surveying these wonders of nature it occurred to me that\nthis was a good opportunity to discover the north-west passage, if any\nsuch thing existed, and not only obtain the reward offered by\ngovernment, but the honour of a discovery pregnant with so many\nadvantages to every European nation. But while my thoughts were\nabsorbed in this pleasing reverie I was alarmed by the first eagle\nstriking its head against a solid transparent substance, and in a\nmoment that which I rode experienced the same fate, and both fell down\nseemingly dead.",
        "Here our lives must inevitably have terminated, had not a sense of\ndanger, and the singularity of my situation, inspired me with a degree\nof skill and dexterity which enabled us to fall near two miles\nperpendicular with as little inconveniency as if we had been let down\nwith a rope: for no sooner did I perceive the eagles strike against a\nfrozen cloud, which is very common near the poles, than (they being\nclose together) I laid myself along the back of the foremost, and took\nhold of its wings to keep them extended, at the same time stretching\nout my legs behind to support the wings of the other. This had the\ndesired effect, and we descended very safe on a mountain of ice, which\nI supposed to be about three miles above the level of the sea.",
        "I dismounted, unloaded the eagles, opened one of the bladders, and\nadministered some of the liquor to each of them, without once\nconsidering that the horrors of destruction seemed to have conspired\nagainst me. The roaring of waves, crashing of ice, and the howling of\nbears, conspired to form a scene the most awful and tremendous: but\nnotwithstanding this, my concern for the recovery of the eagles was so\ngreat, that I was insensible of the danger to which I was exposed.\nHaving rendered them every assistance in my power, I stood over them\nin painful anxiety, fully sensible that it was only by means of them\nthat I could possibly be delivered from these abodes of despair.",
        "But suddenly a monstrous bear began to roar behind me, with a voice\nlike thunder. I turned round, and seeing the creature just ready to\ndevour me, having the bladder of liquor in my hands, through fear I\nsqueezed it so hard, that it burst, and the liquor flying in the eyes\nof the animal, totally deprived it of sight. It instantly turned from\nme, ran away in a state of distraction, and soon fell over a precipice\nof ice into the sea, where I saw it no more.",
        "The danger being over, I again turned my attention to the eagles, whom\nI found in a fair way of recovery, and suspecting that they were faint\nfor want of victuals, I took one of the beef fruit, cut it into small\nslices, and presented them with it, which they devoured with avidity.",
        "Having given them plenty to eat and drink, and disposed of the\nremainder of my provision, I took possession of my seat as before.\nAfter composing myself, and adjusting everything in the best manner, I\nbegan to eat and drink very heartily; and through the effects of the\nmountain wine, as I called it, was very cheerful, and began to sing a\nfew verses of a song which I had learned when I was a boy: but the\nnoise soon alarmed the eagles, who had been asleep, through the\nquantity of liquor which they had drank, and they rose seemingly much\nterrified. Happily for me, however, when I was feeding them I had\naccidentally turned their heads towards the south-east, which course\nthey pursued with a rapid motion. In a few hours I saw the Western\nIsles, and soon after had the inexpressible pleasure of seeing Old\nEngland. I took no notice of the seas or islands over which I passed.",
        "The eagles descended gradually as they drew near the shore, intending,\nas I supposed, to alight on one of the Welsh mountains; but when they\ncame to the distance of about sixty yards two guns were fired at them,\nloaded with balls, one of which took place in a bladder of liquor that\nhung to my waist; the other entered the breast of the foremost eagle,\nwho fell to the ground, while that which I rode, having received no\ninjury, flew away with amazing swiftness.",
        "This circumstance alarmed me exceedingly, and I began to think it was\nimpossible for me to escape with my life; but recovering a little, I\nonce more looked down upon the earth, when, to my inexpressible joy, I\nsaw Margate at a little distance, and the eagle descending on the old\ntower whence it had carried me on the morning of the day before. It no\nsooner came down than I threw myself off, happy to find that I was\nonce more restored to the world. The eagle flew away in a few minutes,\nand I sat down to compose my fluttering spirits, which I did in a few\nhours.",
        "I soon paid a visit to my friends, and related these adventures.\nAmazement stood in every countenance; their congratulations on my\nreturning in safety were repeated with an unaffected degree of\npleasure, and we passed the evening as we are doing now, every person\npresent paying the highest compliments to my COURAGE and VERACITY.",
        "Baron Munchausen has certainly been productive of much benefit to the\nliterary world; the numbers of egregious travellers have been such,\nthat they demanded a very Gulliver to surpass them. If Baron de Tott\ndauntlessly discharged an enormous piece of artillery, the Baron\nMunchausen has done more; he has taken it and swam with it across the\nsea. When travellers are solicitous to be the heroes of their own\nstory, surely they must admit to superiority, and blush at seeing\nthemselves out-done by the renowned Munchausen: I doubt whether any\none hitherto, Pantagruel, Gargantua, Captain Lemuel, or De Tott, has\nbeen able to out-do our Baron in this species of excellence: and as at\npresent our curiosity seems much directed to the interior of Africa,\nit must be edifying to have the real relation of Munchausen’s\nadventures there before any further intelligence arrives; for he seems\nto adapt himself and his exploits to the spirit of the times, and\nrecounts what he thinks should be most interesting to his auditors.",
        "I do not say that the Baron, in the following stories, means a satire\non any political matters whatever. No; but if the reader understands\nthem so, I cannot help it.",
        "If the Baron meets with a parcel of negro ships carrying whites into\nslavery to work upon their plantations in a cold climate, should we\ntherefore imagine that he intends a reflection on the present traffic\nin human flesh? And that, if the negroes should do so, it would be\nsimple justice, as retaliation is the law of God! If we were to think\nthis a reflection on any present commercial or political matter, we\nshould be tempted to imagine, perhaps, some political ideas conveyed\nin every page, in every sentence of the whole. Whether such things are\nor are not the intentions of the Baron the reader must judge.",
        "We have had not only wonderful travellers in this vile world, but\nsplenetic travellers, and of these not a few, and also conspicuous\nenough. It is a pity, therefore, that the Baron has not endeavoured to\nsurpass them also in this species of story-telling. Who is it can read\nthe travels of Smellfungus, as Sterne calls him, without admiration?\nTo think that a person from the North of Scotland should travel\nthrough some of the finest countries in Europe, and find fault with\neverything he meets–nothing to please him! And therefore, methinks,\nthe Tour to the Hebrides is more excusable, and also perhaps Mr.\nTwiss’s Tour in Ireland. Dr. Johnson, bred in the luxuriance of\nLondon, with more reason should become cross and splenetic in the\nbleak and dreary regions of the Hebrides.",
        "The Baron, in the following work, seems to be sometimes philosophical;\nhis account of the language of the interior of Africa, and its analogy\nwith that of the inhabitants of the moon, show him to be profoundly\nversed in the etymological antiquities of nations, and throw new light\nupon the abstruse history of the ancient Scythians, and the\nCollectanea.",
        "His endeavour to abolish the custom of eating live flesh in the\ninterior of Africa, as described in Bruce’s Travels, is truly humane.\nBut far be it from me to suppose, that by Gog and Magog and the Lord\nMayor’s show he means a satire upon any person or body of persons\nwhatever: or, by a tedious litigated trial of blind judges and dumb\nmatrons following a wild goose chase all round the world, he should\nglance at any trial whatever.",
        "Nevertheless, I must allow that it was extremely presumptuous in\nMunchausen to tell half the sovereigns of the world that they were\nwrong, and advise them what they ought to do; and that instead of\nordering millions of their subjects to massacre one another, it would\nbe more to their interest to employ their forces in concert for the\ngeneral good; as if he knew better than the Empress of Russia, the\nGrand Vizier, Prince Potemkin, or any other butcher in the world. But\nthat he should be a royal Aristocrat, and take the part of the injured\nQueen of France in the present political drama, I am not at all\nsurprised; but I suppose his mind was fired by reading the pamphlet\nwritten by Mr. Burke.",
        "  The Baron insists on the veracity of his former Memoirs–Forms a\n  design of making discoveries in the interior parts of Africa–His\n  discourse with Hilaro Frosticos about it–His conversation with\n  Lady Fragrantia–The Baron goes, with other persons of\n  distinction, to Court; relates an anecdote of the Marquis de\n  Bellecourt.",
        "All that I have related before, said the Baron, is gospel; and if\nthere be any one so hardy as to deny it, I am ready to fight him with\nany weapon he pleases. Yes, cried he, in a more elevated tone, as he\nstarted from his seat, I will condemn him to swallow this decanter,\nglass and all perhaps, and filled with kerren-wasser [a kind of ardent\nspirit distilled from cherries, and much used in some parts of\nGermany]. Therefore, my dear friends and companions, have confidence\nin what I say, and pay honour to the tales of Munchausen. A traveller\nhas a right to relate and embellish his adventures as he pleases, and\nit is very unpolite to refuse that deference and applause they\ndeserve.",
        "Having passed some time in England since the completion of my former\nmemoirs, I at length began to revolve in my mind what a prodigious\nfield of discovery must be in the interior part of Africa. I could not\nsleep with the thoughts of it; I therefore determined to gain every\nproper assistance from Government to penetrate the celebrated source\nof the Nile, and assume the viceroyship of the interior kingdoms of\nAfrica, or, at least, the great realm of Monomotapa. It was happy for\nme that I had one most powerful friend at court, whom I shall call the\nillustrious Hilaro Frosticos. You perchance know him not by that name;\nbut we had a language among ourselves, as well we may, for in the\ncourse of my peregrinations I have acquired precisely nine hundred and\nninety-nine leash of languages. What! gentlemen, do you stare? Well, I\nallow there are not so many languages spoken in this vile world; but\nthen, have I not been in the moon? and trust me, whenever I write a\ntreatise upon education, I shall delineate methods of inculcating\nwhole dozens of languages at once, French, Spanish, Greek, Hebrew,\nCherokee, &c., in such a style as will shame all the pedagogues\nexisting.",
        "Having passed a whole night without being able to sleep for the vivid\nimagination of African discoveries, I hastened to the levee of my\nillustrious friend Hilaro Frosticos, and having mentioned my intention\nwith all the vigour of fancy, he gravely considered my words, and\nafter some awful meditations thus he spoke: Olough, ma genesat, istum\nfullanah, cum dera kargos belgarasah eseum balgo bartigos\ntriangulissimus! However, added he, it behoveth thee to consider and\nponder well upon the perils and the multitudinous dangers in the way\nof that wight who thus advanceth in all the perambulation of\nadventures: and verily, most valiant sire and Baron, I hope thou wilt\ndemean thyself with all that laudable gravity and precaution which, as\nis related in the three hundred and forty-seventh chapter of the\nProphilactics, is of more consideration than all the merit in this\nterraqueous globe. Yes, most truly do I advise thee unto thy good, and\nspeak unto thee, most valiant Munchausen, with the greatest esteem,\nand wish thee to succeed in thy voyage; for it is said, that in the\ninterior realms of Africa there are tribes that can see but just three\ninches and a half beyond the extremity of their noses; and verily thou\nshouldest moderate thyself, even sure and slow; they stumble who walk\nfast. But we shall bring you unto the Lady Fragrantia, and have her\nopinion of the matter. He then took from his pocket a cap of dignity,\nsuch as described in the most honourable and antique heraldry, and\nplacing it upon my head, addressed me thus:–\"As thou seemest again to\nrevive the spirit of ancient adventure, permit me to place upon thy\nhead this favour, as a mark of the esteem in which I hold thy valorous\ndisposition.”",
        "The Lady Fragrantia, my dear friends, was one of the most divine\ncreatures in all Great Britain, and was desperately in love with me.\nShe was drawing my portrait upon a piece of white satin, when the most\nnoble Hilaro Frosticos advanced. He pointed to the cap of dignity\nwhich he had placed upon my head. “I do declare, Hilaro,” said the\nlovely Fragrantia, “’tis pretty, ’tis interesting; I love you, and I\nlike you, my dear Baron,” said she, putting on another plume: “this\ngives it an air more delicate and more fantastical. I do thus, my dear\nMunchausen, as your friend, yet you can reject or accept my present\njust as you please; but I like the fancy, ’tis a good one, and I mean\nto improve it: and against whatever enemies you go, I shall have the\nsweet satisfaction to remember you bear my favour on your head!”",
        "I snatched it with trepidation, and gracefully dropping on my knees, I\nthree times kissed it with all the rapture of romantic love. “I\nswear,” cried I, “by thy bright eyes, and by the lovely whiteness of\nthine arm, that no savage, tyrant, or enemy upon the face of the earth\nshall despoil me of this favour, while one drop of the blood of the\nMunchausens doth circulate in my veins! I will bear it triumphant\nthrough the realms of Africa, whither I now intend my course, and make\nit respected, even in the court of Prester John.”",
        "“I admire your spirit,” replied she, “and shall use my utmost interest\nat court to have you despatched with every pomp, and as soon as\npossible; but here comes a most brilliant company indeed, Lady\nCarolina Wilhelmina Amelia Skeggs, Lord Spigot, and Lady Faucet, and\nthe Countess of Belleair.”",
        "After the ceremonies of introduction to this company were over, we\nproceeded to consult upon the business; and as the cause met with\ngeneral applause, it was immediately determined that I should proceed\nwithout delay, as soon as I obtained the sovereign approbation. “I am\nconvinced,” said Lord Spigot, “that if there be any thing really\nunknown and worthy of our most ardent curiosity, it must be in the\nimmense regions of Africa; that country, which seems to be the oldest\non the globe, and yet with the greater part of which we are almost\nutterly unacquainted; what prodigious wealth of gold and diamonds must\nnot lie concealed in those torrid regions, when the very rivers on the\ncoast pour forth continual specimens of golden sand! ’Tis my opinion,\ntherefore, that the Baron deserves the applause of all Europe for his\nspirit, and merits the most powerful assistance of the sovereign.”",
        "So flattering an approbation, you may be sure, was delightful to my\nheart, and with every confidence and joy I suffered them to take me to\ncourt that instant. After the usual ceremonies of introduction,\nsuffice it to say that I met with every honour and applause that my\nmost sanguine expectations could demand. I had always a taste for the\nfashionable je ne sais quoi of the most elegant society, and in the\npresence of all the sovereigns of Europe I ever found myself quite at\nhome, and experienced from the whole court the most flattering esteem\nand admiration. I remember, one particular day, the fate of the\nunfortunate Marquis de Bellecourt. The Countess of Rassinda, who\naccompanied him, looked most divinely. “Yes, I am confident,” said the\nMarquis de Bellecourt to me, “that I have acted according to the\nstrictest sentiments of justice and of loyalty to my sovereign. What\nstronger breast-plate than a heart untainted? and though I did not\nreceive a word nor a look, yet I cannot think–no, it were impossible\nto be misrepresented. Conscious of my own integrity, I will try again\n–I will go boldly up.” The Marquis de Bellecourt saw the opportunity;\nhe advanced three paces, put his hand upon his breast and bowed.\n\"Permit me,” said he, “with the most profound respect, to––.” His\ntongue faltered–he could scarcely believe his sight, for at that\nmoment the whole company were moving out of the room. He found himself\nalmost alone, deserted by every one. “What!” said he, “and did he turn\nupon his heel with the most marked contempt? Would he not speak to me?\nWould he not even hear me utter a word in my defence?” His heart died\nwithin him–not even a look, a smile from any one. “My friends! Do\nthey not know me? Do they not see me? Alas! they fear to catch the\ncontagion of my––. Then,” said he, “adieu!–’tis more than I can\nbear. I shall go to my country seat, and never, never will return.\nAdieu, fond court, adieu!–”",
        "The venerable Marquis de Bellecourt stopped for a moment ere he\nentered his carriage. Thrice he looked back, and thrice he wiped the\nstarting tear from his eye. “Yes,” said he, “for once, at least, truth\nshall be found–in the bottom of a well!”",
        "Peace to thy ghost, most noble marquis! a King of kings shall pity\nthee; and thousands who are yet unborn shall owe their happiness to\nthee, and have cause to bless the thousands, perhaps, that shall never\neven know thy name; but Munchausen’s self shall celebrate thy glory!",
        "  Preparations for the Baron’s expedition into Africa–Description\n  of his chariot; the beauties of its interior decorations; the\n  animals that drew it, and the mechanism of the wheels.",
        "Everything being concluded, and having received my instructions for\nthe voyage, I was conducted by the illustrious Hilaro Frosticos, the\nLady Fragrantia, and a prodigious crowd of nobility, and placed\nsitting upon the summit of the whale’s bones at the palace; and having\nremained in this situation for three days and three nights, as a trial\nordeal, and a specimen of my perseverance and resolution, the third\nhour after midnight they seated me in the chariot of Queen Mab. It was\na prodigious dimension, large enough to contain more stowage than the\ntun of Heidelberg, and globular like a hazel-nut: in fact, it seemed\nto be really a hazel-nut grown to a most extravagant dimension, and\nthat a great worm of proportionable enormity had bored a hole in the\nshell. Through this same entrance I was ushered. It was as large as a\ncoach-door, and I took my seat in the centre, a kind of chair self-\nbalanced without touching anything, like the fancied tomb of Mahomet.\nThe whole interior surface of the nutshell appeared a luminous\nrepresentation of all the stars of heaven, the fixed stars, the\nplanets, and a comet. The stars were as large as those worn by our\nfirst nobility, and the comet, excessively brilliant, seemed as if you\nhad assembled all the eyes of the beautiful girls in the kingdom, and\ncombined them, like a peacock’s plumage, into the form of a comet–\nthat is, a globe, and a bearded tail to it, diminishing gradually to a\npoint. This beautiful constellation seemed very sportive and\ndelightful. It was much in the form of a tadpole! and, without\nceasing, went, full of playful giddiness, up and down, all over the\nheaven on the concave surface of the nutshell. One time it would be at\nthat part of the heavens under my feet, and in the next minute would\nbe over my head. It was never at rest, but for ever going east, west,\nnorth, or south, and paid no more respect to the different worlds than\nif they were so many lanterns without reflectors. Some of them he\nwould dash against and push out of their places; others he would burn\nup and consume to ashes: and others again he would split into\nfritters, and their fragments would instantly take a globular form,\nlike spilled quicksilver, and become satellites to whatever other\nworlds they should happen to meet with in their career. In short, the\nwhole seemed an epitome of the creation, past, present, and future;\nand all that passes among the stars during one thousand years was here\ngenerally performed in as many seconds.",
        "I surveyed all the beauties of the chariot with wonder and delight.\n\"Certainly,” cried I, “this is heaven in miniature!” In short, I took\nthe reins in my hand. But before I proceed on my adventures, I shall\nmention the rest of my attendant furniture. The chariot was drawn by a\nteam of nine bulls harnessed to it, three after three. In the first\nrank was a most tremendous bull named John Mowmowsky; the rest were\ncalled Jacks in general, but not dignified by any particular\ndenomination. They were all shod for the journey, not indeed like\nhorses, with iron, or as bullocks commonly are, to drag on a cart; but\nwere shod with men’s skulls. Each of their feet was, hoof and all,\ncrammed into a man’s head, cut off for the purpose, and fastened\ntherein with a kind of cement or paste, so that the skull seemed to be\na part of the foot and hoof of the animal. With these skull-shoes the\ncreatures could perform astonishing journeys, and slide upon the\nwater, or upon the ocean, with great velocity. The harnesses were\nfastened with golden buckles, and decked with studs in a superb style,\nand the creatures were ridden by nine postillions, crickets of a great\nsize, as large as monkeys, who sat squat upon the heads of the bulls,\nand were continually chirping at a most infernal rate, loud in\nproportion to their bodies.",
        "The wheels of the chariot consisted of upwards of ten thousand\nsprings, formed so as to give the greater impetuosity to the vehicle,\nand were more complex than a dozen clocks like that of Strasburgh. The\nexternal of the chariot was adorned with banners, and a superb festoon\nof laurel that formerly shaded me on horseback. And now, having given\nyou a very concise description of my machine for travelling into\nAfrica, which you must allow to be far superior to the apparatus of\nMonsieur Vaillant, I shall proceed to relate the exploits of my\nvoyage.",
        "  The Baron proceeds on his voyage–Convoys a squadron to Gibraltar\n  –Declines the acceptance of the island of Candia–His chariot\n  damaged by Pompey’s Pillar and Cleopatra’s Needle–The Baron out-\n  does Alexander–Breaks his chariot, and splits a great rock at the\n  Cape of Good Hope.",
        "Taking the reins in my hand, while the music gave a general salute, I\ncracked my whip, away they went, and in three hours I found myself\njust between the Isle of Wight and the main land of England. Here I\nremained four days, until I had received part of my accompaniment,\nwhich I was ordered to take under my convoy. ’Twas a squadron of men-\nof-war that had been a long time prepared for the Baltic, but which\nwere now destined for the Mediterranean. By the assistance of large\nhooks and eyes, exactly such as are worn in our hats, but of a greater\nsize, some hundredweight each, the men-of-war hooked themselves on to\nthe wheels of the vehicle: and, in fact, nothing could be more simple\nor convenient, because they could be hooked or unhooked in an instant\nwith the utmost facility. In short, having given a general discharge\nof their artillery, and three cheers, I cracked my whip, away we went,\nhelter skelter, and in six jiffies I found myself and all my retinue\nsafe and in good spirits just at the rock of Gibraltar. Here I\nunhooked my squadron, and having taken an affectionate leave of the\nofficers, I suffered them to proceed in their ordinary manner to the\nplace of their destination. The whole garrison were highly delighted\nwith the novelty of my vehicle; and at the pressing solicitations of\nthe governor and officers I went ashore, and took a view of that\nbarren old rock, about which more powder has been fired away than\nwould purchase twice as much fertile ground in any part of the world!\nMounting my chariot, I took the reins, and again made forward, in mad\ncareer, down the Mediterranean to the isle of Candia. Here I received\ndespatches from the Sublime Porte, entreating me to assist in the war\nagainst Russia, with a reward of the whole island of Candia for my\nalliance. At first I hesitated, thinking that the island of Candia\nwould be a most valuable acquisition to the sovereign who at that time\nemployed me, and that the most delicious wines, sugar, &c., in\nabundance would flourish on the island; yet, when I considered the\ntrade of the East India Company, which would most probably suffer by\nthe intercourse with Persia through the Mediterranean, I at once\nrejected the proposal, and had afterwards the thanks of the Honourable\nthe House of Commons for my propriety and political discernment.",
        "Having been properly refreshed at Candia, I again proceeded, and in a\nshort time arrived in the land of Egypt. The land of this country, at\nleast that part of it near the sea, is very low, so that I came upon\nit ere I was aware, and the Pillar of Pompey got entangled in the\nvarious wheels of the machine, and damaged the whole considerably.\nStill I drove on through thick and thin, till, passing over that great\nobelisk, the Needle of Cleopatra, the work got entangled again, and\njolted at a miserable rate over the mud and swampy ground of all that\ncountry; yet my poor bulls trotted on with astonishing labour across\nthe Isthmus of Suez into the Red Sea, and left a track, an obscure\nchannel, which has since been taken by De Tott for the remains of a\ncanal cut by some of the Ptolemies from the Red Sea to the\nMediterranean; but, as you perceive, was in reality no more than the\ntrack of my chariot, the car of Queen Mab.",
        "As the artists at present in that country are nothing wonderful,\nthough the ancient Egyptians, ’tis said, were most astonishing\nfellows, I could not procure any new coach-springs, or have a\npossibility of setting my machine to rights in the kingdom of Egypt;\nand as I could not presume to attempt another journey overland, and\nthe great mountains of marble beyond the source of the Nile, I thought\nit most eligible to make the best way I could, by sea, to the Cape of\nGood Hope, where I supposed I should get some Dutch smiths and\ncarpenters, or perhaps some English artists; and my vehicle being\nproperly repaired, it was my intention thence to proceed, overland,\nthrough the heart of Africa. The surface of the water, I well knew,\nafforded less resistance to the wheels of the machine–it passed along\nthe waves like the chariot of Neptune; and in short, having gotten\nupon the Red Sea, we scudded away to admiration through the pass of\nBabelmandeb to the great Western coast of Africa, where Alexander had\nnot the courage to venture.",
        "And really, my friends, if Alexander had ventured toward the Cape of\nGood Hope he most probably would have never returned. It is difficult\nto determine whether there were then any inhabitants in the more\nsouthern parts of Africa or not; yet, at any rate, this conqueror of\nthe world would have made but a nonsensical adventure; his miserable\nships, not contrived for a long voyage, would have become leaky, and\nfoundered, before he could have doubled the Cape, and left his Majesty\nfairly beyond the limits of the then known world. Yet it would have\nbeen an august exit for an Alexander, after having subdued Persia and\nIndia, to be wandering the Lord knows where, to Jup or Ammon, perhaps,\nor on a voyage to the moon, as an Indian chief once said to Captain\nCook.",
        "But, for my part, I was far more successful than Alexander; I drove on\nwith the most amazing rapidity, and thinking to halt on shore at the\nCape, I unfortunately drove too close, and shattered the right side\nwheels of my vehicle against the rock, now called the Table Mountain.\nThe machine went against it with such impetuosity as completely\nshivered the rock in a horizontal direction; so that the summit of the\nmountain, in the form of a semi-sphere, was knocked into the sea, and\nthe steep mountain becoming thereby flattened at the top, has since\nreceived the name of the Table Mountain, from its similarity to that\npiece of furniture.",
        "Just as this part of the mountain was knocked off, the ghost of the\nCape, that tremendous sprite which cuts such a figure in the Lusiad,\nwas discovered sitting squat in an excavation formed for him in the\ncentre of the mountain. He seemed just like a young bee in his little\ncell before he comes forth, or like a bean in a bean-pod; and when the\nupper part of the mountain was split across and knocked off, the\nsuperior half of his person was discovered. He appeared of a bottle-\nblue colour, and started, dazzled with the unexpected glare of the\nlight: hearing the dreadful rattle of the wheels, and the loud\nchirping of the crickets, he was thunder-struck, and instantly giving\na shriek, sunk down ten thousand fathoms into the earth, while the\nmountain, vomiting out some smoke, silently closed up, and left not a\ntrace behind!",
        "  The Baron secures his chariot, &c., at the Cape and takes his\n  passage for England in a homeward-bound Indiaman–Wrecked upon an\n  island of ice, near the coast of Guinea–Escapes from the wreck,\n  and rears a variety of vegetables upon the island–Meets some\n  vessels belonging to the negroes bringing white slaves from\n  Europe, in retaliation, to work upon their plantations in a cold\n  climate near the South Pole–Arrives in England, and lays an\n  account of his expedition before the Privy Council–Great\n  preparations for a new expedition–The Sphinx, Gog and Magog, and\n  a great company attend him–The ideas of Hilaro Frosticos\n  respecting the interior parts of Africa.",
        "I perceived with grief and consternation the miscarriage of all my\napparatus; yet I was not absolutely dejected: a great mind is never\nknown but in adversity. With permission of the Dutch governor the\nchariot was properly laid up in a great storehouse, erected at the\nwater’s edge, and the bulls received every refreshment possible after\nso terrible a voyage. Well, you may be sure they deserved it, and\ntherefore every attendance was engaged for them, until I should\nreturn.",
        "As it was not possible to do anything more I took my passage in a\nhomeward-bound Indiaman, to return to London, and lay the matter\nbefore the Privy Council.",
        "We met with nothing particular until we arrived upon the coast of\nGuinea, where, to our utter astonishment, we perceived a great hill,\nseemingly of glass, advancing against us in the open sea; the rays of\nthe sun were reflected upon it with such splendour, that it was\nextremely difficult to gaze at the phenomenon. I immediately knew it\nto be an island of ice, and though in so very warm a latitude,\ndetermined to make all possible sail from such horrible danger. We did\nso, but all in vain, for about eleven o’clock at night, blowing a very\nhard gale, and exceedingly dark, we struck upon the island. Nothing\ncould equal the distraction, the shrieks, and despair of the whole\ncrew, until I, knowing there was not a moment to be lost, cheered up\ntheir spirits, and bade them not despond, but do as I should request\nthem. In a few minutes the vessel was half full of water, and the\nenormous castle of ice that seemed to hem us in on every side, in some\nplaces falling in hideous fragments upon the deck, killed one half of\nthe crew; upon which, getting upon the summit of the mast, I contrived\nto make it fast to a great promontory of the ice, and calling to the\nremainder of the crew to follow me, we all escaped from the wreck, and\ngot upon the summit of the island.",
        "The rising sun soon gave us a dreadful prospect of our situation, and\nthe loss, or rather iceification, of the vessel; for being closed in\non every side with castles of ice during the night, she was absolutely\nfrozen over and buried in such a manner that we could behold her under\nour feet, even in the central solidity of the island. Having debated\nwhat was best to be done, we immediately cut down through the ice, and\ngot up some of the cables of the vessel, and the boats, which, making\nfast to the island, we towed it with all our might, determined to\nbring home island and all, or perish in the attempt. On the summit of\nthe island we placed what oakum and dregs of every kind of matter we\ncould get from the vessel, which, in the space of a very few hours, on\naccount of the liquefying of the ice, and the warmth of the sun, were\ntransformed into a very fine manure; and as I had some seeds of exotic\nvegetables in my pocket, we shortly had a sufficiency of fruits and\nroots growing upon the island to supply the whole crew, especially the\nbread-fruit tree, a few plants of which had been in the vessel; and\nanother tree, which bore plum-puddings so very hot, and with such\nexquisite proportion of sugar, fruit, &c., that we all acknowledged it\nwas not possible to taste anything of the kind more delicious in\nEngland: in short, though the scurvy had made such dreadful progress\namong the crew before our striking upon the ice, the supply of\nvegetables, and especially the bread-fruit and pudding-fruit, put an\nalmost immediate stop to the distemper.",
        "We had not proceeded thus many weeks, advancing with incredible\nfatigue by continual towing, when we fell in with a fleet of Negro-\nmen, as they call them. These wretches, I must inform you, my dear\nfriends, had found means to make prizes of those vessels from some\nEuropeans upon the coast of Guinea, and tasting the sweets of luxury,\nhad formed colonies in several new discovered islands near the South\nPole, where they had a variety of plantations of such matters as would\nonly grow in the coldest climates. As the black inhabitants of Guinea\nwere unsuited to the climate and excessive cold of the country, they\nformed the diabolical project of getting Christian slaves to work for\nthem. For this purpose they sent vessels every year to the coast of\nScotland, the northern parts of Ireland, and Wales, and were even\nsometimes seen off the coast of Cornwall. And having purchased, or\nentrapped by fraud or violence, a great number of men, women, and\nchildren, they proceeded with their cargoes of human flesh to the\nother end of the world, and sold them to their planters, where they\nwere flogged into obedience, and made to work like horses all the rest\nof their lives.",
        "My blood ran cold at the idea, while every one on the island also\nexpressed his horror that such an iniquitous traffic should be\nsuffered to exist. But, except by open violence, it was found\nimpossible to destroy the trade, on account of a barbarous prejudice,\nentertained of late by the negroes, that the white people have no\nsouls! However, we were determined to attack them, and steering down\nour island upon them, soon overwhelmed them: we saved as many of the\nwhite people as possible, but pushed all the blacks into the water\nagain. The poor creatures we saved from slavery were so overjoyed,\nthat they wept aloud through gratitude, and we experienced every\ndelightful sensation to think what happiness we should shower upon\ntheir parents, their brothers and sisters and children, by bringing\nthem home safe, redeemed from slavery, to the bosom of their native\ncountry.",
        "Having happily arrived in England, I immediately laid a statement of\nmy voyage, &c., before the Privy Council, and entreated an immediate\nassistance to travel into Africa, and, if possible, refit my former\nmachine, and take it along with the rest. Everything was instantly\ngranted to my satisfaction, and I received orders to get myself ready\nfor departure as soon as possible.",
        "As the Emperor of China had sent a most curious animal as a present to\nEurope, which was kept in the Tower, and it being of an enormous\nstature, and capable of performing the voyage with éclat, she was\nordered to attend me. She was called Sphinx, and was one of the most\ntremendous though magnificent figures I ever beheld. She was harnessed\nwith superb trappings to a large flat-bottomed boat, in which was\nplaced an edifice of wood, exactly resembling Westminster Hall. Two\nballoons were placed over it, tackled by a number of ropes to the\nboat, to keep up a proper equilibrium, and prevent it from\noverturning, or filling, from the prodigious weight of the fabric.",
        "The interior of the edifice was decorated with seats, in the form of\nan amphitheatre, and crammed as full as it could hold with ladies and\nlords, as a council and retinue for your humble servant. Nearly in the\ncentre was a seat elegantly decorated for myself, and on either side\nof me were placed the famous Gog and Magog in all their pomp.",
        "The Lord Viscount Gosamer being our postillion, we floated gallantly\ndown the river, the noble Sphinx gambolling like the huge leviathan,\nand towing after her the boat and balloons.",
        "Thus we advanced, sailing gently, into the open sea; being calm\nweather, we could scarcely feel the motion of the vehicle, and passed\nour time in grand debate upon the glorious intention of our voyage,\nand the discoveries that would result.",
        "“I am of opinion,” said my noble friend, Hilaro Frosticos, “that\nAfrica was originally inhabited for the greater part, or, I may say,\nsubjugated by lions which, next to man, seem to be the most dreaded of\nall mortal tyrants. The country in general–at least, what we have\nbeen hitherto able to discover, seems rather inimical to human life;\nthe intolerable dryness of the place, the burning sands that overwhelm\nwhole armies and cities in general ruin, and the hideous life many\nroving hordes are compelled to lead, incline me to think, that if ever\nwe form any great settlements therein, it will become the grave of our\ncountrymen. Yet it is nearer to us than the East Indies, and I cannot\nbut imagine, that in many places every production of China, and of the\nEast and West Indies, would flourish, if properly attended to. And as\nthe country is so prodigiously extensive and unknown, what a source of\ndiscovery must not it contain! In fact, we know less about the\ninterior of Africa than we do of the moon; for in this latter we\nmeasure the very prominences, and observe the varieties and\ninequalities of the surface through our glasses–",
        " “Forests and mountains on her spotted orb.",
        "“But we see nothing in the interior of Africa, but what some compilers\nof maps or geographers are fanciful enough to imagine. What a happy\nevent, therefore, should we not expect from a voyage of discovery and\ncolonisation undertaken in so magnificent a style as the present! what\na pride–what an acquisition to philosophy!”",
        "  Count Gosamer thrown by Sphinx into the snow on the top of\n  Teneriffe–Gog and Magog conduct Sphinx for the rest of the voyage\n  –The Baron arrives at the Cape, and unites his former chariot,\n  &c., to his new retinue–Passes into Africa, proceeding from the\n  Cape northwards–Defeats a host of lions by a curious stratagem–\n  Travels through an immense desert–His whole company, chariot,\n  &c., overwhelmed by a whirlwind of sand–Extricates them, and\n  arrives in a fertile country.",
        "The brave Count Gosamer, with a pair of hell-fire spurs on, riding\nupon Sphinx, directed the whole retinue towards the Madeiras. But the\nCount had no small share of an amiable vanity, and perceiving great\nmultitudes of people, Gascons, &c., assembled upon the French coast,\nhe could not refrain from showing some singular capers, such as they\nhad never seen before: but especially when he observed all the members\nof the National Assembly extend themselves along the shore, as a piece\nof French politeness, to honour this expedition, with Rousseau,\nVoltaire, and Beelzebub at their head; he set spurs to Sphinx, and at\nthe same time cut and cracked away as hard as he could, holding in the\nreins with all his might, striving to make the creature plunge and\nshow some uncommon diversion. But sulky and ill-tempered was Sphinx at\nthe time: she plunged indeed–such a devil of a plunge, that she\ndashed him in one jerk over her head, and he fell precipitately into\nthe water before her. It was in the Bay of Biscay, all the world knows\na very boisterous sea, and Sphinx, fearing he would be drowned, never\nturned to the left or the right out of her way, but advancing furious,\njust stooped her head a little, and supped the poor count off the\nwater, into her mouth, together with the quantity of two or three tuns\nof water, which she must have taken in along with him, but which were,\nto such an enormous creature as Sphinx, nothing more than a spoonful\nwould be to any of you or me. She swallowed him, but when she had got\nhim in her stomach, his long spurs so scratched and tickled her, that\nthey produced the effect of an emetic. No sooner was he in, but out he\nwas squirted with the most horrible impetuosity, like a ball or a\nshell from the calibre of a mortar. Sphinx was at this time quite sea-\nsick, and the unfortunate count was driven forth like a sky-rocket,\nand landed upon the peak of Teneriffe, plunged over head and ears in\nthe snow–requiescat in pace!",
        "I perceived all this mischief from my seat in the ark, but was in such\na convulsion of laughter that I could not utter an intelligible word.\nAnd now Sphinx, deprived of her postillion, went on in a zigzag\ndirection, and gambolled away after a most dreadful manner. And thus\nhad everything gone to wreck, had I not given instant orders to Gog\nand Magog to sally forth. They plunged into the water, and swimming on\neach side, got at length right before the animal, and then seized the\nreins. Thus they continued swimming on each side, like tritons,\nholding the muzzle of Sphinx, while I, sallying forth astride upon the\ncreature’s back, steered forward on our voyage to the Cape of Good\nHope.",
        "Arriving at the Cape, I immediately gave orders to repair my former\nchariot and machines, which were very expeditiously performed by the\nexcellent artists I had brought with me from Europe. And now\neverything being refitted, we launched forth upon the water: perhaps\nthere never was anything seen more glorious or more august. ’Twas\nmagnificent to behold Sphinx make her obeisance on the water, and the\ncrickets chirp upon the bulls in return of the salute; while Gog and\nMagog, advancing, took the reins of the great John Mowmowsky, and\nleading towards us chariot and all, instantly disposed of them to the\nforepart of the ark by hooks and eyes, and tackled Sphinx before all\nthe bulls. Thus the whole had a most tremendous and triumphal\nappearance. In front floated forwards the mighty Sphinx, with Gog and\nMagog on each side; next followed in order the bulls with crickets\nupon their heads; and then advanced the chariot of Queen Mab,\ncontaining the curious seat and orrery of heaven; after which appeared\nthe boat and ark of council, overtopped with two balloons, which gave\nan air of greater lightness and elegance to the whole. I placed in the\ngalleries under the balloons, and on the backs of the bulls, a number\nof excellent vocal performers, with martial music of clarionets and\ntrumpets. They sung the “Watery Dangers,” and the “Pomp of Deep\nCerulean!” The sun shone glorious on the water while the procession\nadvanced toward the land, under five hundred arches of ice,\nilluminated with coloured lights, and adorned in the most grotesque\nand fanciful style with sea-weed, elegant festoons, and shells of\nevery kind; while a thousand water-spouts danced eternally before and\nafter us, attracting the water from the sea in a kind of cone, and\nsuddenly uniting with the most fantastical thunder and lightning.",
        "Having landed our whole retinue, we immediately began to proceed\ntoward the heart of Africa, but first thought it expedient to place a\nnumber of wheels under the ark for its greater facility of advancing.\nWe journeyed nearly due north for several days, and met with nothing\nremarkable except the astonishment of the savage natives to behold our\nequipage.",
        "The Dutch Government at the Cape, to do them justice, gave us every\npossible assistance for the expedition. I presume they had received\ninstruction on that head from their High Mightinesses in Holland.\nHowever, they presented us with a specimen of some of the most\nexcellent of their Cape wine, and showed us every politeness in their\npower. As to the face of the country, as we advanced, it appeared in\nmany places capable of every cultivation, and of abundant fertility.\nThe natives and Hottentots of this part of Africa have been frequently\ndescribed by travellers, and therefore it is not necessary to say any\nmore about them. But in the more interior parts of Africa the\nappearance, manners, and genius of the people are totally different.",
        "We directed our course by the compass and the stars, getting every day\nprodigious quantities of game in the woods, and at night encamping\nwithin a proper enclosure for fear of the wild beasts. One whole day\nin particular we heard on every side, among the hills, the horrible\nroaring of lions, resounding from rock to rock like broken thunder. It\nseemed as if there was a general rendezvous of all these savage\nanimals to fall upon our party. That whole day we advanced with\ncaution, our hunters scarcely venturing beyond pistol shot from the\ncaravan for fear of dissolution. At night we encamped as usual, and\nthrew up a circular entrenchment round our tents. We had scarce\nretired to repose when we found ourselves serenaded by at least one\nthousand lions, approaching equally on every side, and within a\nhundred paces. Our cattle showed the most horrible symptoms of fear,\nall trembling, and in cold perspiration. I directly ordered the whole\ncompany to stand to their arms, and not to make any noise by firing\ntill I should command them. I then took a large quantity of tar, which\nI had brought with our caravan for that purpose, and strewed it in a\ncontinued stream round the encampment, within which circle of tar I\nimmediately placed another train or circle of gunpowder, and having\ntaken this precaution, I anxiously waited the lions’ approach. These\ndreadful animals, knowing, I presume, the force of our troop, advanced\nvery slowly, and with caution, approaching on every side of us with an\nequal pace, and growling in hideous concert, so as to resemble an\nearthquake, or some similar convulsion of the world. When they had at\nlength advanced and steeped all their paws in the tar, they put their\nnoses to it, smelling it as if it were blood, and daubed their great\nbushy hair and whiskers with it equal to their paws. At that very\ninstant, when, in concert, they were to give the mortal dart upon us,\nI discharged a pistol at the train of gunpowder, which instantly\nexploded on every side, made all the lions recoil in general uproar,\nand take to flight with the utmost precipitation. In an instant we\ncould behold them scattered through the woods at some distance,\nroaring in agony, and moving about like so many Will-o’-the-Wisps,\ntheir paws and faces all on fire from the tar and the gun-powder. I\nthen ordered a general pursuit: we followed them on every side through\nthe woods, their own light serving as our guide, until, before the\nrising of the sun, we followed into their fastnesses and shot or\notherwise destroyed every one of them, and during the whole of our\njourney after we never heard the roaring of a lion, nor did any wild\nbeast presume to make another attack upon our party, which shows the\nexcellence of immediate presence of mind, and the terror inspired into\nthe savage enemies by a proper and well-timed proceeding.",
        "We at length arrived on the confines of an immeasurable desert–an\nimmense plain, extending on every side of us like an ocean. Not a\ntree, nor a shrub, nor a blade of grass was to be seen, but all\nappeared an extreme fine sand, mixed with gold-dust and little\nsparkling pearls.",
        "The gold-dust and pearls appeared to us of little value, because we\ncould have no expectation of returning to England for a considerable\ntime. We observed, at a great distance, something like a smoke arising\njust over the verge of the horizon, and looking with our telescopes we\nperceived it to be a whirlwind tearing up the sand and tossing it\nabout in the heavens with frightful impetuosity. I immediately ordered\nmy company to erect a mound around us of a great size, which we did\nwith astonishing labour and perseverance, and then roofed it over with\ncertain planks and timber, which we had with us for the purpose. Our\nlabour was scarcely finished when the sand came rolling in like the\nwaves of the sea; ’twas a storm and river of sand united. It continued\nto advance in the same direction, without intermission, for three\ndays, and completely covered over the mound we had erected, and buried\nus all within. The intense heat of the place was intolerable; but\nguessing, by the cessation of the noise, that the storm was passed, we\nset about digging a passage to the light of day again, which we\neffected in a very short time, and ascending, perceived that the whole\nhad been so completely covered with the sand, that there appeared no\nhills, but one continued plain, with inequalities or ridges on it like\nthe waves of the sea. We soon extricated our vehicle and retinue from\nthe burning sands, but not without great danger, as the heat was very\nviolent, and began to proceed on our voyage. Storms of sand of a\nsimilar nature several times attacked us, but by using the same\nprecautions we preserved ourselves repeatedly from destruction. Having\ntravelled more than nine thousand miles over this inhospitable plain,\nexposed to the perpendicular rays of a burning sun, without ever\nmeeting a rivulet, or a shower from heaven to refresh us, we at length\nbecame almost desperate, when, to our inexpressible joy, we beheld\nsome mountains at a great distance, and on our nearer approach\nobserved them covered with a carpet of verdure and groves and woods.\nNothing could appear more romantic or beautiful than the rocks and\nprecipices intermingled with flowers and shrubs of every kind, and\npalm-trees of such a prodigious size as to surpass anything ever seen\nin Europe. Fruits of all kinds appeared growing wild in the utmost\nabundance, and antelopes and sheep and buffaloes wandered about the\ngroves and valleys in profusion. The trees resounded with the melody\nof birds, and everything displayed a general scene of rural happiness\nand joy.",
        "  A feast on live bulls and kava–The inhabitants admire the\n  European adventurers–The Emperor comes to meet the Baron, and\n  pays him great compliments–The inhabitants of the centre of\n  Africa descended from the people of the moon proved by an\n  inscription in Africa, and by the analogy of their language, which\n  is also the same with that of the ancient Scythians–The Baron is\n  declared sovereign of the interior of Africa on the decease of the\n  Emperor–He endeavours to abolish the custom of eating live bulls,\n  which excites much discontent–The advice of Hilaro Frosticos upon\n  the occasion–The Baron makes a speech to an Assembly of the\n  states, which only excites greater murmurs–He consults with\n  Hilaro Frosticos.",
        "Having passed over the nearest mountains we entered a delightful vale,\nwhere we perceived a multitude of persons at a feast of living bulls,\nwhose flesh they cut away with great knives, making a table of the\ncreature’s carcase, serenaded by the bellowing of the unfortunate\nanimal. Nothing seemed requisite to add to the barbarity of this feast\nbut kava, made as described in Cook’s voyages, and at the conclusion\nof the feast we perceived them brewing this liquor, which they drank\nwith the utmost avidity. From that moment, inspired with an idea of\nuniversal benevolence, I determined to abolish the custom of eating\nlive flesh and drinking of kava. But I knew that such a thing could\nnot be immediately effected, whatever in future time might be\nperformed.",
        "Having rested ourselves during a few days, we determined to set out\ntowards the principal city of the empire. The singularity of our\nappearance was spoken of all over the country as a phenomenon. The\nmultitude looked upon Sphinx, the bulls, the crickets, the balloons,\nand the whole company, as something more than terrestrial, but\nespecially the thunder of our fire-arms, which struck horror and\namazement into the whole nation.",
        "We at length arrived at the metropolis, situated on the banks of a\nnoble river, and the emperor, attended by all his court, came out in\ngrand procession to meet us. The emperor appeared mounted on a\ndromedary, royally caparisoned, with all his attendants on foot\nthrough respect for his Majesty. He was rather above the middle\nstature of that country, four feet three inches in height, with a\ncountenance, like all his countrymen, as white as snow! He was\npreceded by a band of most exquisite music, according to the fashion\nof the country, and his whole retinue halted within about fifty paces\nof our troop. We returned the salute by a discharge of musketry, and a\nflourish of our trumpets and martial music. I commanded our caravan to\nhalt, and dismounting, advanced uncovered, with only two attendants,\ntowards his Majesty. The emperor was equally polite, and descending\nfrom his dromedary, advanced to meet me. “I am happy,” said he, “to\nhave the honour to receive so illustrious a traveller, and assure you\nthat everything in my empire shall be at your disposal.”",
        "I thanked his Majesty for his politeness, and expressed how happy I\nwas to meet so polished and refined a people in the centre of Africa,\nand that I hoped to show myself and company grateful for his esteem,\nby introducing the arts and sciences of Europe among the people.",
        "I immediately perceived the true descent of this people, which does\nnot appear of terrestrial origin, but descended from some of the\ninhabitants of the moon, because the principal language spoken there,\nand in the centre of Africa, is very nearly the same. Their alphabet\nand method of writing are pretty much the same, and show the extreme\nantiquity of this people, and their exalted origin. I here give you a\nspecimen of their writing [Vide Otrckocsus de Orig. Hung. p. 46]:–\nStregnah, dna skoohtop.",
        "These characters I have submitted to the inspection of a celebrated\nantiquarian, and it will be proved to the satisfaction of every one,\nin his next volume, what an immediate intercourse there must have been\nbetween the inhabitants of the moon and the ancient Scythians, which\nScythians did not by any means inhabit a part of Russia, but the\ncentral part of Africa, as I can abundantly prove to my very learned\nand laborious friend. The above words, written in our characters, are\nSregnah dna skoohtop; that is, The Scythians are of heavenly origin.\nThe word Sregnah, which signifies Scythians, is compounded of\nsreg or sre, whence our present English word sire, or sir: and\nnah, or gnah, knowledge, because the Scythians united the\nessentials of nobility and learning together: dna signifies heaven,\nor belonging to the moon, from duna, who was anciently worshipped as\ngoddess of that luminary. And skooh-top signifies the origin or\nbeginning of anything, from skoo, the name used in the moon for a\npoint in geometry, and top or htop, vegetation. These words are\ninscribed at this day upon a pyramid in the centre of Africa, nearly\nat the source of the river Niger; and if any one refuses his assent,\nhe may go there to be convinced.",
        "The emperor conducted me to his court amidst the admiration of his\ncourtiers, and paid us every possible politeness that African\nmagnificence could bestow. He never presumed to proceed on any\nexpedition without consulting us, and looking upon us as a species of\nsuperior beings, paid the greatest respect to our opinions. He\nfrequently asked me about the states of Europe, and the kingdom of\nGreat Britain, and appeared lost in admiration at the account I gave\nhim of our shipping, and the immensity of the ocean. We taught him to\nregulate the government nearly on the same plan with the British\nconstitution, and to institute a parliament and degrees of nobility.\nHis majesty was the last of his royal line, and on his decease, with\nthe unanimous consent of the people, made me heir to the whole empire.\nThe nobility and chiefs of the country immediately waited upon me with\npetitions, entreating me to accept the government. I consulted with my\nnoble friends, Gog and Magog, &c., and after much consultation it was\nagreed that I should accept the government, not as actual and\nindependent monarch of the place, but as viceroy to his Majesty of\nEngland.",
        "I now thought it high time to do away the custom of eating of live\nflesh and drinking of kava, and for that purpose used every persuasive\nmethod to wean the majority of the people from it. This, to my\nastonishment, was not taken in good part by the nation, and they\nlooked with jealousy at those strangers who wanted to make innovations\namong them.",
        "Nevertheless, I felt much concern to think that my fellow-creatures\ncould be capable of such barbarity. I did everything that a heart\nfraught with universal benevolence and good will to all mankind could\nbe capable of desiring. I first tried every method of persuasion and\nincitement. I did not harshly reprove them, but I invited frequently\nwhole thousands to dine, after the fashion of Europe, upon roasted\nmeat. Alas, ’twas all in vain! my goodness nearly excited a sedition.\nThey murmured among themselves, spoke of my intentions, my wild and\nambitious views, as if I, O heaven! could have had any personal\ninterested motive in making them live like men, rather than like\ncrocodiles and tigers. In fine, perceiving that gentleness could be of\nno avail, well knowing that when complaisance can effect nothing from\nsome spirits, compulsion excites respect and veneration, I prohibited,\nunder the pain of the severest penalties, the drinking of kava, or\neating of live flesh, for the space of nine days, within the districts\nof Angalinar and Paphagalna.",
        "But this created such an universal abhorrence and detestation of my\ngovernment, that my ministers, and even myself, were universally\npasquinadoed; lampoons, satires, ridicule, and insult, were showered\nupon the name of Munchausen wherever it was mentioned; and in fine,\nthere never was a government so much detested, or with such little\nreason.",
        "In this dilemma I had recourse to the advice of my noble friend Hilaro\nFrosticos. In his good sense I now expected some resource, for the\nrest of the council, who had advised me to the former method, had\ngiven but a poor specimen of their abilities and discernment, or I\nshould have succeeded more happily. In short, he addressed himself to\nme and to the council as follows:–",
        "“It is in vain, most noble Munchausen, that your Excellency endeavours\nto compel or force these people to a life to which they have never\nbeen accustomed. In vain do you tell them that apple-pies, pudding,\nroast beef, minced pies, or tarts, are delicious, that sugar is sweet,\nthat wine is exquisite. Alas! they cannot, they will not comprehend\nwhat deliciousness is, what sweetness, or what the flavour of the\ngrape. And even if they were convinced of the superior excellence of\nyour way of life, never, never would they be persuaded; and that if\nfor no other reason, but because force or persuasion is employed to\ninduce them to it. Abandon that idea for the present, and let us try\nanother method. My opinion, therefore, is, that we should at once\ncease all endeavours to compel or persuade them. But let us, if\npossible, procure a quantity of fudge from England, and carelessly\nscatter it over all the country; and from this disposal of matters I\npresume–nay, I have a moral certainty, that we shall reclaim this\npeople from horror and barbarity.”",
        "Had this been proposed at any other time, it would have been violently\nopposed in the council; but now, when every other attempt had failed,\nwhen there seemed no other resource, the majority willingly submitted\nto they knew not what, for they absolutely had no idea of the manner,\nthe possibilities of success, or how they could bring matters to bear.\nHowever, ’twas a scheme, and as such they submitted. For my part, I\nlistened with ecstasy to the words of Hilaro Frosticos, for I knew\nthat he had a most singular knowledge of human kind, and could humour\nand persuade them on to their own happiness and universal good.\nTherefore, according to the advice of Hilaro, I despatched a balloon\nwith four men over the desert to the Cape of Good Hope, with letters\nto be forwarded to England, requiring, without delay, a few cargoes of\nfudge.",
        "The people had all this time remained in a general state of ferment\nand murmur. Everything that rancour, low wit, and deplorable ignorance\ncould conceive to asperse my government, was put in execution. The\nmost worthy, even the most beneficent actions, everything that was\namiable, were perverted into opposition.",
        "The heart of Munchausen was not made of such impenetrable stuff as to\nbe insensible to the hatred of even the most worthless wretch in the\nwhole kingdom; and once, at a general assembly of the states, filled\nwith an idea of such continued ingratitude, I spoke as pathetic as\npossible, not, methought, beneath my dignity, to make them feel for\nme: that the universal good and happiness of the people were all I\nwished or desired; that if my actions had been mistaken, or improper\nsurmises formed, still I had no wish, no desire, but the public\nwelfare, &c. &c. &c.",
        "Hilaro Frosticos was all this time much disturbed; he looked sternly\nat me–he frowned, but I was so engrossed with the warmth of my heart,\nmy intentions, that I understood him not: in a minute I saw nothing\nbut as if through a cloud (such is the force of amiable sensibility)–\nlords, ladies, chiefs–the whole assembly seemed to swim before my\nsight. The more I thought on my good intentions, the lampoons which so\nmuch affected my delicacy, good nature, tenderness–I forgot myself–I\nspoke rapid, violent–beneficence–fire–tenderness–alas! I melted\ninto tears!",
        "“Pish! pish!” said Hilaro Frosticos.",
        "Now, indeed, was my government lampooned, satirised, carribonadoed,\nbepickled, and bedevilled. One day, with my arm full of lampoons, I\nstarted up as Hilaro entered the room, the tears in my eyes: “Look,\nlook here, Hilaro!–how can I bear all this? It is impossible to\nplease them; I will leave the government–I cannot bear it! See what\npitiful anecdotes–what surmises: I will make my people feel for me–I\nwill leave the government!”",
        "“Pshaw!” says Hilaro. At that simple mono-syllable I found myself\nchanged as if by magic! for I ever looked on Hilaro as a person so\nexperienced–such fortitude, such good sense. “There are three sails,\nunder the convoy of a frigate,” added Hilaro, “just arrived at the\nCape, after a fortunate passage, laden with the fudge that we\ndemanded. No time is to be lost; let it be immediately conducted\nhither, and distributed through the principal granaries of the\nempire.”",
        "  A proclamation by the Baron–Excessive curiosity of the people to\n  know what fudge was–The people in a general ferment about it–\n  They break open all the granaries in the empire–The affections of\n  the people conciliated–An ode performed in honour of the Baron–\n  His discourse with Fragrantia on the excellence of the music.",
        "Some time after I ordered the following proclamation to be published\nin the Court Gazette, and in all the other papers of the empire:–",
        "  BY THE MOST MIGHTY AND PUISSANT LORD,\n  HIS EXCELLENCY THE\n  LORD BARON MUNCHAUSEN.",
        "  Whereas a quantity of fudge has been distributed through all the\n  granaries of the empire for particular uses; and as the natives\n  have ever expressed their aversion to all manner of European\n  eatables, it is hereby strictly forbidden, under pain of the\n  severest penalties, for any of the officers charged with the\n  keeping of the said fudge to give, sell, or suffer to be sold, any\n  part or quantity whatever of the said material, until it be\n  agreeable unto our good will and pleasure.",
        "  Dated in our Castle of Gristariska\n    this Triskill of the month of\n    Griskish, in the year Moulikasra-\n    navas-kashna-vildash.",
        "This proclamation excited the most ardent curiosity all over the\nempire. “Do you know what this fudge is?” said Lady Mooshilgarousti to\nLord Darnarlaganl. “Fudge!” said he, “Fudge! no: what fudge?” “I\nmean,” replied her Ladyship, “the enormous quantity of fudge that has\nbeen distributed under guards in all the strong places in the empire,\nand which is strictly forbidden to be sold or given to any of the\nnatives under the severest penalties.” “Lord!” replied he, “what in\nthe name of wonder can it be? Forbidden! why it must, but pray do you,\nLady Fashashash, do you know what this fudge is? Do you, Lord\nTrastillauex? or you, Miss Gristilarkask? What! nobody know what this\nfudge can be?”",
        "It engrossed for several days the chit-chat of the whole empire.\nFudge, fudge, fudge, resounded in all companies and in all places,\nfrom the rising until the setting of the sun; and even at night, when\ngentle sleep refreshed the rest of mortals, the ladies of all that\ncountry were dreaming of fudge!",
        "“Upon my honour,” said Kitty, as she was adjusting her modesty piece\nbefore the glass, just after getting out of bed, “there is scarce\nanything I would not give to know what this fudge can be.” “La! my\ndear,” replied Miss Killnariska, “I have been dreaming the whole night\nof nothing but fudge; I thought my lover kissed my hand, and pressed\nit to his bosom, while I, frowning, endeavoured to wrest it from him:\nthat he kneeled at my feet. No, never, never will I look at you, cried\nI, till you tell me what this fudge can be, or get me some of it.\nBegone! cried I, with all the dignity of offended beauty, majesty, and\na tragic queen. Begone! never see me more, or bring me this delicious\nfudge. He swore, on the honour of a knight, that he would wander o’er\nthe world, encounter every danger, perish in the attempt, or satisfy\nthe angel of his soul.”",
        "The chiefs and nobility of the nation, when they met together to drink\ntheir kava, spoke of nothing but fudge. Men, women, and children all,\nall talked of nothing but fudge. ’Twas a fury of curiosity, one\ngeneral ferment, and universal fever–nothing but fudge could allay\nit.",
        "But in one respect they all agreed, that government must have had some\ninterested view, in giving such positive orders to preserve it, and\nkeep it from the natives of the country. Petitions were addressed to\nme from all quarters, from every corporation and body of men in the\nwhole empire. The majority of the people instructed their\nconstituents, and the parliament presented a petition, praying that I\nwould be pleased to take the state of the nation under consideration,\nand give orders to satisfy the people, or the most dreadful\nconsequences were to be apprehended. To these requests, at the\nentreaty of my council, I made no reply, or at best but unsatisfactory\nanswers. Curiosity was on the rack; they forgot to lampoon the\ngovernment, so engaged were they about the fudge. The great assembly\nof the states could think of nothing else. Instead of enacting laws\nfor the regulation of the people, instead of consulting what should\nseem most wise, most excellent, they could think, talk, and harangue\nof nothing but fudge. In vain did the Speaker call to order; the more\nchecks they got the more extravagant and inquisitive they were.",
        "In short, the populace in many places rose in the most outrageous and\ntumultuous manner, forced open the granaries in all places in one day,\nand triumphantly distributed the fudge through the whole empire.",
        "Whether on account of the longing, the great curiosity, imagination,\nor the disposition of the people, I cannot say–but they found it\ninfinitely to their taste; ’twas intoxication of joy, satisfaction,\nand applause.",
        "Finding how much they liked this fudge, I procured another quantity\nfrom England, much greater than the former, and cautiously bestowed it\nover all the kingdom. Thus were the affections of the people regained;\nand they, from hence, began to venerate, applaud, and admire my\ngovernment more than ever. The following ode was performed at the\ncastle, in the most superb style, and universally admired:–",
        "  Ye bulls and crickets, and Gog, Magog,\n  And trump’ts high chiming anthrophog,\n  Come sing blithe choral all in og,\n  Caralog, basilog, fog, and bog!",
        "  Great and superb appears thy cap sublime,\n    Admired and worshipp’d as the rising sun;\n  Solemn, majestic, wise, like hoary Time,\n    And fam’d alike for virtue, sense, and fun.",
        "  Then swell the noble strain with song,\n    And elegance divine,\n  While goddesses around shall throng,\n    And all the muses nine.",
        "  And bulls, and crickets, and Gog, Magog,\n  And trumpets chiming anthrophog,\n  Shall sing blithe choral all in og,\n  Caralog, basilog, fog, and bog!",
        "This piece of poetry was much applauded, admired, and encored in\nevery public assembly, celebrated as an astonishing effort of genius;\nand the music, composed by Minheer Gastrashbark Gkrghhbarwskhk, was\nthought equal to the sense!–Never was there anything so universally\nadmired, the summit of the most exquisite wit, the keenest praise, the\nmost excellent music.",
        "“Upon my honour, and the faith I owe my love,” said I, “music may be\ntalked of in England, but to possess the very soul of harmony the\nworld should come to the performance of this ode.” Lady Fragrantia was\nat that moment drumming with her fingers on the edge of her fan, lost\nin a reverie, thinking she was playing upon–– Was it a forte piano?",
        "“No, my dear Fragrantia,” said I, tenderly taking her in my arms while\nshe melted into tears; “never, never, will I play upon any other––!”",
        "Oh! ’twas divine, to see her like a summer’s morning, all blushing and\nfull of dew!",
        "  The Baron sets all the people of the empire to work to build a\n  bridge from their country to Great Britain–His contrivance to\n  render the arch secure–Orders an inscription to be engraved on\n  the bridge–Returns with all his company, chariot, etc., to\n  England–Surveys the kingdoms and nations under him from the\n  middle of the bridge.",
        "“And now, most noble Baron,” said the illustrious Hilaro Frosticos,\n\"now is the time to make this people proceed in any business that we\nfind convenient. Take them at this present ferment of the mind, let\nthem not think, but at once set them to work.” In short, the whole\nnation went heartily to the business, to build an edifice such as was\nnever seen in any other country. I took care to supply them with their\nfavourite kava and fudge, and they worked like horses. The tower of\nBabylon, which, according to Hermogastricus, was seven miles high, or\nthe Chinese wall, was a mere trifle, in comparison to this stupendous\nedifice, which was completed in a very short space of time.",
        "It was of an immense height, far beyond anything that ever had been\nbefore erected, and of such gentle ascent, that a regiment of cavalry\nwith a train of cannon could ascend with perfect ease and facility. It\nseemed like a rainbow in the heavens, the base of which appeared to\nrise in the centre of Africa, and the other extremity seemed to stoop\ninto great Britain. A most noble bridge indeed, and a piece of masonry\nthat has outdone Sir Christopher Wren. Wonderful must it have been to\nform so tremendous an arch, especially as the artists had certain\ndifficulties to labour against which they could not have in the\nformation of any other arch in the world–I mean, the attraction of\nthe moon and planets: Because the arch was of so great a height, and\nin some parts so elongated from the earth, as in a great measure to\ndiminish in its gravitation to the centre of our globe; or rather,\nseemed more easily operated upon by the attraction of the planets: So\nthat the stones of the arch, one would think, at certain times, were\nready to fall up to the moon, and at other times to fall down to the\nearth. But as the former was more to be dreaded, I secured stability\nto the fabric by a very curious contrivance: I ordered the architects\nto get the heads of some hundred numbskulls and blockheads, and fix\nthem to the interior surface of the arch, at certain intervals, all\nthe whole length, by which means the arch was held together firm, and\nits inclination to the earth eternally established; because of all the\nthings in the world, the skulls of these kind of animals have a\nstrange facility of tending to the centre of the earth.",
        "The building being completed, I caused an inscription to be engraved\nin the most magnificent style upon the summit of the arch, in letters\nso great and luminous, that all vessels sailing to the East or West\nIndies might read them distinct in the heavens, like the motto of\nConstantine.",
        "  KARDOL BAGARLAN KAI TON FARINGO SARGAI RA\n  MO PASHROL VATINEAC CAL COLNITOS RO NA FILNAT\n  AGASTRA SA DINGANNAL FANO.",
        "That is to say, “As long as this arch and bond of union shall exist,\nso long shall the people be happy. Nor can all the power of the world\naffect them, unless the moon, advancing from her usual sphere, should\nso much attract the skulls as to cause a sudden elevation, on which\nthe whole will fall into the most horrible confusion.”",
        "An easy intercourse being thus established between Great Britain and\nthe centre of Africa, numbers travelled continually to and from both\ncountries, and at my request mail coaches were ordered to run on the\nbridge between both empires. After some time, having settled the\ngovernment to my satisfaction, I requested permission to resign, as a\ngreat cabal had been excited against me in England; I therefore\nreceived my letters of recall, and prepared to return to Old England.",
        "In fine, I set out upon my journey, covered with applause and general\nadmiration. I proceeded with the same retinue that I had before–\nSphinx, Gog and Magog, &c., and advanced along the bridge, lined on\neach side with rows of trees, adorned with festoons of various\nflowers, and illuminated with coloured lights. We advanced at a great\nrate along the bridge, which was so very extensive that we could\nscarcely perceive the ascent, but proceeded insensibly until we\narrived on the centre of the arch. The view from thence was glorious\nbeyond conception; ’twas divine to look down on the kingdoms and seas\nand islands under us. Africa seemed in general of a tawny brownish\ncolour, burned up by the sun: Spain seemed more inclining to a yellow,\non account of some fields of corn scattered over the kingdom; France\nappeared more inclining to a bright straw-colour, intermixed with\ngreen; and England appeared covered with the most beautiful verdure. I\nadmired the appearance of the Baltic Sea, which evidently seemed to\nhave been introduced between those countries by the sudden splitting\nof the land, and that originally Sweden was united to the western\ncoast of Denmark; in short, the whole interstice of the Gulf of\nFinland had no being, until these countries, by mutual consent,\nseparated from one another. Such were my philosophical meditations as\nI advanced, when I observed a man in armour with a tremendous spear or\nlance, and mounted upon a steed, advancing against me. I soon\ndiscovered by a telescope that it could be no other than Don Quixote,\nand promised myself much amusement in the rencounter.",
        "  The Baron’s retinue is opposed in a heroic style by Don Quixote,\n  who in his turn is attacked by Gog and Magog–Lord Whittington,\n  with the Lord Mayor’s show, comes to the assistance of Don Quixote\n  –Gog and Magog assail his Lordship–Lord Whittington makes a\n  speech, and deludes Gog and Magog to his party–A general scene of\n  uproar and battle among the company, until the Baron, with great\n  presence of mind, appeases the tumult.",
        "“What art thou?” exclaimed Don Quixote on his potent steed. “Who art\nthou? Speak! or, by the eternal vengeance of mine arm, thy whole\nmachinery shall perish at sound of this my trumpet!”",
        "Astonished at so rude a salutation, the great Sphinx stopped short,\nand bridling up herself, drew in her head, like a snail when it\ntouches something that it does not like: the bulls set up a horrid\nbellowing, the crickets sounded an alarm, and Gog and Magog advanced\nbefore the rest. One of these powerful brothers had in his hand a\ngreat pole, to the extremity of which was fastened a cord of about two\nfeet in length, and to the end of the cord was fastened a ball of\niron, with spikes shooting from it like the rays of a star; with this\nweapon he prepared to encounter, and advancing thus he spoke:–",
        "“Audacious wight! that thus, in complete steel arrayed, doth dare to\nventure cross my way, to stop the great Munchausen. Know then, proud\nknight, that thou shalt instant perish ’neath my potent arm.”",
        "When Quixote, Mancha’s knight, responded firm:–",

        "At that same moment ten thousand frogs started from the morions of Gog\nand Magog, and furiously assailed the knight on every side. In vain he\nroared, and invoked fair Dulcinea del Toboso: for frogs’ wild croaking\nseemed more loud, more sonorous than all his invocations. And thus in\nbattle vile the knight was overcome, and spawn all swarmed upon his\nglittering helmet.",
        "“Detested miscreants!” roared the knight; “avaunt!

        "He spake, and sudden good Lord Whittington, at head of all his raree-\nshow, came forth, armour antique of chivalry, and helmets old, and\ntroops, all streamers, flags and banners glittering gay, red, gold,\nand purple; and in every hand a square of gingerbread, all gilded\nnice, was brandished awful. At a word, ten thousand thousand Naples\nbiscuits, crackers, buns, and flannel-cakes, and hats of gingerbread\nencountered in mid air in glorious exaltation, like some huge storm of\nmill-stones, or when it rains whole clouds of dogs and cats.",
        "The frogs, astonished, thunderstruck, forgot their notes and music,\nthat before had seemed so terrible, and drowned the cries of knight\nrenown, and mute in wonder heard the words of Whittington, pronouncing\nsolemn:–\"Goblins, chimeras dire, or frogs, or whatsoe’er enchantment\nthus presents in antique shape, attend and hear the words of peace;\nand thou, good herald, read aloud the Riot Act!”",
        "He ceased, and dismal was the tone that softly breathed from all the\nfrogs in chorus, who quick had petrified with fright, unless redoubted\nGog and Magog, both with poles, high topped with airy bladders by a\nstring dependent, had not stormed against his lordship. Ever and anon\nthe bladders, loud resounding on his chaps, proclaimed their fury\nagainst all potent law, coercive mayoralty; when he, submissive, thus\nin cunning guile addressed the knights assailant:–\"Gog, Magog,\nrenowned and famous! what, my sons, shall you assail your father,\nfriend, and chief confessed? Shall you, thus armed with bladders vile,\nattack my title, eminence, and pomp sublime? Subside, vile discord,\nand again return to your true ’legiance. Think, my friends, how oft\nyour gorgeous pouch I’ve crammed, all calapash, green fat, and\ncalapee. Remember how you’ve feasted, stood inert for ages, until size\nimmense you’ve gained. And think, how different is the service of\nMunchausen, where you o’er seas, cold, briny, float along the tide,\neternal toiling like to slaves of Algiers and Tripoli. And ev’n on\nhigh, balloon like, through the heavens have journeyed late, upon a\nrainbow or some awful bridge stretched eminent, as if on earth he had\nnot work sufficient to distress your potent servitudes, but he should\nalso seek in heaven dire cause of labour! Recollect, my friends, even\nwhy or wherefore should you thus assail your lawful magistrate, or why\ndesert his livery? or for what or wherefore serve this German Lord\nMunchausen, who for all your labour shall alone bestow some fudge and\nheroic blows in war? Then cease, and thus in amity return to\nfriendship aldermanic, bungy, brown, and sober.”",
        "Ceased he then, right worshipful, when both the warring champions\ninstant stemmed their battle, and in sign of peace and unity\nreturning, ’neath their feet reclined their weapons. Sudden at a\nsignal either stamped his foot sinistrine, and the loud report of\nbursten bladder stunned each ear surrounding, like the roar of thunder\nfrom on high convulsing heaven and earth.",
        "’Twas now upon the saddle once again the knight of Mancha rose, and in\nhis hand far balancing his lance, full tilt against the troops of\nbulls opposing run.

And now Whittington advanced, ’midst armour antique and the\npowers Magog and Gog, and with his rod enchanting touched the head of\nevery frog, long mute and thunderstruck, at which, in universal chorus\nand salute, they sung blithe jocund, and amain advanced rebellious\n’gainst my troop.",
        "While Sphinx, though great, gigantic, seemed instinctive base and\ncowardly, and at the sight of storming gingerbread, and powers, Magog\nand Gog, and Quixote, all against her, started fierce, o’erturning\nboat, balloons, and all; loud roared the bulls, hideous, and the crash\nof wheels, and chaos of confusion drear, resounded far from earth to\nheaven. And still more fierce in charge the great Lord Whittington,\nfrom poke of ermine his famed Grimalkin took. She screamed, and harsh\nattacked my bulls confounded; lightning-like she darted, and from half\nthe troop their eyes devouring tore. Nor could the riders, crickets\nthroned sublime, escape from rage, from fury less averse than cannons\nmurder o’er the stormy sea. The great Mowmowsky roared amain and\nplunged in anguish, shunning every dart of fire-eyed fierce Grimalkin.\nDire the rage of warfare and contending crickets, Quixote and great\nMagog; when Whittington advancing–\"Good, my friends and warriors,\nheadlong on the foe bear down impetuous.” He spoke, and waving high\nthe mighty rod, tipped wonderful each bull, at which more fierce the\ncreatures bellowed, while enchantment drear devoured their vitals. And\nall had gone to wreck in more than mortal strife, unless, like Neptune\norient from the stormy deep, I rose, e’en towering o’er the ruins of\nmy fighting troops. Serene and calm I stood, and gazed around\nundaunted; nor did aught oppose against my foes impetuous. But sudden\nfrom chariot purses plentiful of fudge poured forth, and scattered it\namain o’er all the crowd contending. As when old Catherine or the\ncareful Joan doth scatter to the chickens bits of bread and crumbs\nfragmented, while rejoiced they gobble fast the proffered scraps in\ngeneral plenty and fraternal peace, and “hush,” she cries, “hush!\nhush!”",

        "Having arrived in England once more, the greatest rejoicings were made\nfor my return; the whole city seemed one general blaze of\nillumination, and the Colossus of Rhodes, hearing of my astonishing\nfeats, came on purpose to England to congratulate me on such\nunparalleled achievements. But above all other rejoicings on my\nreturn, the musical oratorio and song of triumph were magnificent in\nthe extreme. Gog and Magog were ordered to take the maiden tower of\nWindsor, and make a tambourine or great drum of it. For this purpose\nthey extended an elephant’s hide, tanned and prepared for the design,\nacross the summit of the tower, from parapet to parapet, so that in\nproportion this extended elephant’s hide was to the whole of the\ncastle what the parchment is to a drum, in such a manner that the\nwhole became one great instrument of war.",
        "To correspond with this, Colossus took Guildhall and Westminster\nAbbey, and turning the foundations towards the heavens, so that the\nroofs of the edifices were upon the ground, he strung them across with\nbrass and steel wire from side to side, and thus, when strung, they\nhad the appearance of most noble dulcimers. He then took the great\ndome of St. Paul’s, raising it off the earth with as much facility as\nyou would a decanter of claret. And when once risen up it had the\nappearance of a quart bottle. Colossus instantly, with his teeth,\ncracked off the superior part of the cupola, and then applying his\nlips to the instrument, began to sound it like a trumpet. ’Twas\nmartial beyond description–tantara!–tara!–ta!",
        "During the concert I walked in the park with Lady Fragrantia: she was\ndressed that morning in a chemise à la reine. “I like,” said she,\n\"the dew of the morning, ’tis delicate and ethereal, and, by thus\nbespangling me, I think it will more approximate me to the nature of\nthe rose [for her looks were like Aurora]; and to confirm the\nvermilion I shall go to Spa.” “And drink the Podhon spring?” added I,\ngazing at her from top to toe. “Yes,” replied the lovely Fragrantia,\n\"with all my heart; ’tis the drink of sweetness and delicacy. Never\nwere there any creatures like the water-drinkers at spa; they seem\nlike so many thirsty blossoms on a peach-tree, that suck up the shower\nin the scorching heat. There is a certain something in the waters that\ngives vigour to the whole frame, and expands every heart with rapture\nand benevolence. They drink! good gods! how they do drink! and then,\nhow they sleep! Pray, my dear Baron, were you ever at the falls of\nNiagara?” “Yes, my lady,” replied I, surprised at such a strange\nassociation of ideas; “I have been, many years ago, at the Falls of\nNiagara, and found no more difficulty in swimming up and down the\ncataracts than I should to move a minuet.” At that moment she dropped\nher nosegay. “Ah,” said she, as I presented it to her, “there is no\ngreat variety in these polyanthuses. I do assure you, my dear Baron,\nthat there is taste in the selection of flowers as well as everything\nelse, and were I a girl of sixteen I should wear some rosebuds in my\nbosom, but at five-and-twenty I think it would be more apropos to\nwear a full-blown rose, quite ripe, and ready to drop off the stalk\nfor want of being pulled–heigh-ho!” “But pray, my lady,” said I, “how\ndo you like the concert?” “Alas!” said she, languishingly, while she\nlaid her hand upon my shoulder, “what are these bodiless sounds and\nvibration to me? and yet what an exquisite sweetness in the songs of\nthe northern part of our island:–’Thou art gone awa’ from me,\nMary!’ How pathetic and divine the little airs of Scotland and the\nHebrides! But never, never can I think of that same Doctor Johnson–\nthat CONSTABLE, as Fergus MacLeod calls him–but I have an idea of a\ngreat brown full-bottomed wig and a hogshead of porter! Oh, ’twas\nbase! to be treated everywhere with politeness and hospitality, and in\nreturn invidiously to smellfungus them all over; to go to the country\nof Kate of Aberdeen, of Auld Robin Gray, ’midst rural innocence and\nsweetness, take up their plaids, and dance. Oh! Doctor, Doctor!”",
        "“And what would you say, Fragrantia, if you were to write a tour to\nthe Hebrides?” “Peace to the heroes,” replied she, in a delicate and\ntheatrical tone; “peace to the heroes who sleep in the isle of Iona;\nthe sons of the wave, and the chiefs of the dark-brown shield! The\ntear of the sympathising stranger is scattered by the wind over the\nhoary stones as she meditates sorrowfully on the times of old! Such\ncould I say, sitting upon some druidical heap or tumulus. The fact is\nthis, there is a right and wrong handle to everything, and there is\nmore pleasure in thinking with pure nobility of heart than with the\nilliberal enmities and sarcasm of a blackguard.”",

        "The contention between Gog and Magog, and Sphinx, Hilaro Frosticos,\nthe Lord Whittington, &c., was productive of infinite litigation. All\nthe lawyers in the kingdom were employed, to render the affair as\ncomplex and gloriously uncertain as possible; and, in fine, the whole\nnation became interested, and were divided on both sides of the\nquestion. Colossus took the part of Sphinx, and the affair was at\nlength submitted to the decision of a grand council in a great hall,\nadorned with seats on every side in form of an amphitheatre. The\nassembly appeared the most magnificent and splendid in the world. A\ncourt or jury of one hundred matrons occupied the principal and most\nhonourable part of the amphitheatre; they were dressed in flowing\nrobes of sky-blue velvet adorned with festoons of brilliants and\ndiamond stars; grave and sedate-looking matrons, all in uniform, with\nspectacles upon their noses; and opposite to these were placed one\nhundred judges, with curly white wigs flowing down on each side of\nthem to their very feet, so that Solomon in all his glory was not so\nwise in appearance. At the ardent request of the whole empire I\ncondescended to be the president of the court, and being arrayed\naccordingly, I took my seat beneath a canopy erected in the centre.\nBefore every judge was placed a square inkstand, containing a gallon\nof ink, and pens of a proportionable size; and also right before him\nan enormous folio, so large as to serve for table and book at the same\ntime. But they did not make much use of their pens and ink, except to\nblot and daub the paper; for, that they should be the more impartial,\nI had ordered that none but the blind should be honoured with the\nemployment: so that when they attempted to write anything, they\nuniformly dipped their pens into the machine containing sand, and\nhaving scrawled over a page as they thought, desiring them to dry it\nwith sand, would spill half a gallon of ink upon the paper, and\nthereby daubing their fingers, would transfer the ink to their face\nwhenever thy leaned their cheek upon their hand for greater gravity.\nAs to the matrons, to prevent an eternal prattle that would drown all\nmanner of intelligibility, I found it absolutely necessary to sew up\ntheir mouths; so that between the blind judges and the dumb matrons\nmethought the trial had a chance of being terminated sooner than it\notherwise would. The matrons, instead of their tongues, had other\ninstruments to convey their ideas: each of them had three quizzes, one\nquiz pendent from the string that sewed up her mouth, and another quiz\nin either hand. When she wished to express her negative, she darted\nand recoiled the quizzes in her right and left hand; and when she\ndesired to express her affirmative, she, nodding, made the quiz\npendent from her mouth flow down and recoil again. The trial proceeded\nin this manner for a long time, to the admiration of the whole empire,\nwhen at length I thought proper to send to my old friend and ally,\nPrester John, entreating him to forward to me one of the species of\nwild and curious birds found in his kingdom, called a Wauwau. This\ncreature was brought over the great bridge before mentioned, from the\ninterior of Africa, by a balloon. The balloon was placed upon the\nbridge, extending over the parapets on each side, with great wings or\noars to assist its velocity, and under the balloon was placed pendant\na kind of boat, in which were the persons to manage the steerage of\nthe machine, and protect Wauwau. This oracular bird, arriving in\nEngland, instantly darted through one of the windows of the great\nhall, and perched upon the canopy in the centre to the admiration of\nall present. Her cackling appeared quite prophetic and oracular; and\nthe first question proposed to her by the unanimous consent of the\nmatrons and judges was, Whether or not the moon was composed of green\ncheese? The solution of this question was deemed absolutely necessary\nbefore they could proceed farther on the trial.",
        "Wauwau seemed in figure not very much differing from a swan, except\nthat the neck was not near so long, and she stood after an admirable\nfashion like to Vestris. She began cackling most sonorously, and the\nwhole assembly agreed that it was absolutely necessary to catch her,\nand having her in their immediate possession, nothing more would be\nrequisite for the termination of this litigated affair. For this\npurpose the whole house rose up to catch her, and approached in\ntumult, the judges brandishing their pens, and shaking their big wigs,\nand the matrons quizzing as much as possible in every direction, which\nvery much startled Wauwau, who, clapping her wings, instantly flew out\nof the hall. The assembly began to proceed after her in order and\nstyle of precedence, together with my whole train of Gog and Magog,\nSphinx, Hilaro Frosticos, Queen Mab’s chariot, the bulls and crickets,\n&c., preceded by bands of music; while Wauwau, descending on the\nearth, ran on like an ostrich before the troop, cackling all the way.\nThinking suddenly to catch this ferocious animal, the judges and\nmatrons would suddenly quicken their pace, but the creature would as\nquickly outrun them, or sometimes fly away for many miles together,\nand then alight to take breath until we came within sight of her\nagain. Our train journeyed over a most prodigious tract of country in\na direct line, over hills and dales, to the summit of Plinlimmon,\nwhere we thought to have seized Wauwau; but she instantly took flight,\nand never ceased until she arrived at the mouth of the Potomac river\nin Virginia.",
        "Our company immediately embarked in the machines before described, in\nwhich we had journeyed into Africa, and after a few days’ sail arrived\nin North America. We met with nothing curious on our voyage, except a\nfloating island, containing some very delightful villages, inhabited\nby a few whites and negroes; the sugar cane did not thrive there well,\non account, as I was informed, of the variety of the climates; the\nisland being sometimes driven up as far as the north pole, and at\nother times wafted under the equinoctial. In pity to the poor\nislanders, I got a huge stake of iron, and driving it through the\ncentre of the island, fastened it to the rocks and mud at the bottom\nof the sea, since which time the island has become stationary, and is\nwell known at present by the name of St. Christopher’s, and there is\nnot an island in the world more secure.",
        "Arriving in North America, we were received by the President of the\nUnited States with every honour and politeness. He was pleased to give\nus all the information possible relative to the woods and immense\nregions of America, and ordered troops of the different tribes of the\nEsquimaux to guide us through the forests in pursuit of Wauwau, who,\nwe at length found, had taken refuge in the centre of a morass. The\ninhabitants of the country, who loved hunting, were much delighted to\nbehold the manner in which we attempted to seize upon Wauwau; the\nchase was noble and uncommon. I determined to surround the animal on\nevery side, and for this purpose ordered the judges and matrons to\nsurround the morass with nets extending a mile in height, on various\nparts of which net the company disposed themselves, floating in the\nair like so many spiders upon their cobwebs. Magog, at my command, put\non a kind of armour that he had carried with him for the purpose,\ncorselet of steel, with gauntlets, helmet, &c., so as nearly to\nresemble a mole. He instantly plunged into the earth, making way with\nhis sharp steel head-piece, and tearing up the ground with his iron\nclaws, and found not much difficulty therein, as morass in general is\nof a soft and yielding texture. Thus he hoped to undermine Wauwau, and\nsuddenly rising, seize her by the foot, while his brother Gog ascended\nthe air in a balloon, hoping to catch her if she could escape Magog.\nThus the animal was surrounded on every side, and at first was very\nmuch terrified, knowing not which way she had best to go. At length\nhearing an obscure noise under ground, Wauwau took flight before Magog\ncould have time to catch her by the foot. She flew to the right, then\nto the left, north, east, west, and south, but found on every side the\ncompany prepared upon their nets. At length she flew right up, soaring\nat a most astonishing rate towards the sun, while the company on every\nside set up one general acclamation. But Gog in his balloon soon\nstopped Wauwau in the midst of her career, and snared her in a net,\nthe cords of which he continued to hold in his hand. Wauwau did not\ntotally lose her presence of mind, but after a little consideration,\nmade several violent darts against the volume of the balloon; so\nfierce, as at length to tear open a great space, on which the\ninflammable air rushing out, the whole apparatus began to tumble to\nthe earth with amazing rapidity. Gog himself was thrown out of the\nvehicle, and letting go the reins of the net, Wauwau got liberty\nagain, and flew out of sight in an instant.",
        "Gog had been above a mile elevated from the earth when he began to\nfall, and as he advanced the rapidity increased, so that he went like\na ball from a cannon into the morass, and his nose striking against\none of the iron-capped hands of his brother Magog, just then rising\nfrom the depths, he began to bleed violently, and, but for the\nsoftness of the morass, would have lost his life.",
        "  The Baron harangues the company, and they continue the pursuit–\n  The Baron, wandering from his retinue, is taken by the savages,\n  scalped, and tied to a stake to be roasted; but he contrives to\n  extricate himself, and kills the savages–The Baron travels\n  overland through the forests of North America, to the confines of\n  Russia–Arrives at the castle of the Nareskin Rowskimowmowsky, and\n  gallops into the kingdom of Loggerheads–A battle, in which the\n  Baron fights the Nareskin in single combat, and generously gives\n  him his life–Arrives at the Friendly Islands, and discourses with\n  Omai–The Baron, with all his attendants, goes from Otaheite to\n  the isthmus of Darien, and having cut a canal across the isthmus,\n  returns to England.",
        "“My friends, and very learned and profound Judiciarii,” said I, “be\nnot disheartened that Wauwau has escaped from you at present:\npersevere, and we shall yet succeed. You should never despair,\nMunchausen being your general; and therefore be brave, be courageous,\nand fortune shall second your endeavours. Let us advance undaunted in\npursuit, and follow the fierce Wauwau even three times round the\nglobe, until we entrap her.”",
        "My words filled them with confidence and valour, and they unanimously\nagreed to continue the chase. We penetrated the frightful deserts and\ngloomy woods of America, beyond the source of the Ohio, through\ncountries utterly unknown before. I frequently took the diversion of\nshooting in the woods, and one day that I happened with three\nattendants to wander far from our troop, we were suddenly set upon by\na number of savages. As we had expended our powder and shot, and\nhappened to have no side-arms, it was in vain to make any resistance\nagainst hundreds of enemies. In short, they bound us, and made us walk\nbefore them to a gloomy cavern in a rock, where they feasted upon what\ngame they had killed, but which not being sufficient, they took my\nthree unfortunate companions and myself, and scalped us. The pain of\nlosing the flesh from my head was most horrible; it made me leap in\nagonies, and roar like a bull. They then tied us to stakes, and making\ngreat fires around us, began to dance in a circle, singing with much\ndistortion and barbarity, and at times putting the palms of their\nhands to their mouths, set up the war-whoop. As they had on that day\nalso made a great prize of some wine and spirits belonging to our\ntroop, these barbarians, finding it delicious, and unconscious of its\nintoxicating quality, began to drink it in profusion, while they\nbeheld us roasting, and in a very short time they were all completely\ndrunk, and fell asleep around the fires. Perceiving some hopes, I used\nmost astonishing efforts to extricate myself from the cords which I\nwas tied, and at length succeeded. I immediately unbound my\ncompanions, and though half roasted, they still had power enough to\nwalk. We sought about for the flesh that had been taken off our heads,\nand having found the scalps, we immediately adapted them to our bloody\nheads, sticking them on with a kind of glue of a sovereign quality,\nthat flows from a tree in that country, and the parts united and\nhealed in a few hours. We took care to revenge ourselves on the\nsavages, and with their own hatchets put every one of them to death.\nWe then returned to our troop, who had given us up for lost, and they\nmade great rejoicings on our return. We now proceeded in our journey\nthrough this prodigious wilderness, Gog and Magog acting as pioneers,\nhewing down the trees, &c., at a great rate as we advanced. We passed\nover numberless swamps and lakes and rivers, until at length we\ndiscovered a habitation at some distance. It appeared a dark and\ngloomy castle, surrounded with strong ramparts, and a broad ditch. We\ncalled a council of war, and it was determined to send a deputation\nwith a trumpet to the walls of the castle, and demand friendship from\nthe governor, whoever he might be, and an account if aught he knew of\nWauwau. For this purpose our whole caravan halted in the wood, and Gog\nand Magog reclined amongst the trees, that their enormous strength and\nsize should not be discovered, and give umbrage to the lord of the\ncastle. Our embassy approached the castle, and having demanded\nadmittance for some time, at length the drawbridge was let down, and\nthey were suffered to enter. As soon as they had passed the gate it\nwas immediately closed after them, and on either side they perceived\nranks of halberdiers, who made them tremble with fear. “We come,” the\nherald proclaimed, “on the part of Hilaro Frosticos, Don Quixote, Lord\nWhittington, and the thrice-renowned Baron Munchausen, to claim\nfriendship from the governor of this puissant castle, and to seek\nWauwau.” “The most noble the governor,” replied the officer, “is at\nall times happy to entertain such travellers as pass through these\nimmense deserts, and will esteem it an honour that the great Hilaro\nFrosticos, Don Quixote, Lord Whittington, and the thrice-renowned\nBaron Munchausen, enter his castle walls.”",
        "In short, we entered the castle. The governor sat with all our company\nto table, surrounded by his friends, of a very fierce and warlike\nappearance. They spoke but little, and seemed very austere and\nreserved, until the first course was served up. The dishes were\nbrought in by a number of bears walking on their hind-legs, and on\nevery dish was a fricassee of pistols, pistol-bullets, sauce of\ngunpowder, and aqua-vitæ. This entertainment seemed rather\nindigestible by even an ostrich’s stomach, when the governor addressed\nus, and informed me that it was ever his custom to strangers to offer\nthem for the first course a service similar to that before us; and if\nthey were inclined to accept the invitation, he would fight them as\nmuch as they pleased, but if they could not relish the pistol-bullets,\n&c., he would conclude them peaceable, and try what better politeness\nhe could show them in his castle. In short, the first course being\nremoved untouched, we dined, and after dinner the governor forced the\ncompany to push the bottle about with alacrity and to excess. He\ninformed us that he was the Nareskin Rowskimowmowsky, who had retired\namidst these wilds, disgusted with the court of Petersburgh. I was\nrejoiced to meet him; I recollected my old friend, whom I had known at\nthe court of Russia, when I rejected the hand of the Empress. The\nNareskin, with all his knights-companions, drank to an astonishing\ndegree, and we all set off upon hobby horses in full cry out of the\ncastle. Never was there seen such a cavalcade before. In front\ngalloped a hundred knights belonging to the castle, with hunting horns\nand a pack of excellent dogs; and then came the Nareskin\nRowskimowmowsky, Gog and Magog, Hilaro Frosticos, and your humble\nservant, hallooing and shouting like so many demoniacs, and spurring\nour hobby horses at an infernal rate until we arrived in the kingdom\nof Loggerheads. The kingdom of Loggerheads was wilder than any part of\nSiberia, and the Nareskin had here built a romantic summer-house in a\nGothic taste, to which he would frequently retire with his company\nafter dinner. The Nareskin had a dozen bears of enormous stature that\ndanced for our amusement, and their chiefs performed the minuet de la\ncour to admiration. And here the most noble Hilaro Frosticos thought\nproper to ask the Nareskin some intelligence about Wauwau, in quest of\nwhom we had travelled over such a tract of country, and encountered so\nmany dangerous adventures, and also invited the Nareskin\nRowskimowmowsky to attend us with all his bears in the expedition. The\nNareskin appeared astonished at the idea; he looked with infinite\nhauteur and ferocity on Hilaro, and affecting a violent passion asked\nhim, “Did he imagine that the Nareskin Rowskimowmowsky could\ncondescend to take notice of a Wauwau, let her fly what way she would!\nOr did he think a chief possessing such blood in his veins could\nengage in such a foreign pursuit? By the blood and by the ashes of my\ngreat grandmother, I would cut off your head!”",
        "Hilaro Frosticos resented this oration, and in short a general riot\ncommenced. The bears, together with the hundred knights, took the part\nof the Nareskin, and Gog and Magog, Don Quixote, the Sphinx, Lord\nWhittington, the bulls, the crickets, the judges, the matrons, and\nHilaro Frosticos, made noble warfare against them.",
        "I drew my sword, and challenged the Nareskin to single combat. He\nfrowned, while his eyes sparkled fire and indignation, and bracing a\nbuckler on his left arm, he advanced against me. I made a blow at him\nwith all my force, which he received upon his buckler, and my sword\nbroke short.",
        "Ungenerous Nareskin; seeing me disarmed, he still pushed forward,\ndealing his blows upon me with the utmost violence, which I parried\nwith my shield and the hilt of my broken sword, and fought like a\ngame-cock.",
        "An enormous bear at the same time attacked me, but I ran my hand still\nretaining the hilt of my broken sword down his throat, and tore up his\ntongue by the roots. I then seized his carcase by the hind-legs, and\nwhirling it over my head, gave the Nareskin such a blow with his own\nbear as evidently stunned him. I repeated my blows, knocking the\nbear’s head against the Nareskin’s head, until, by one happy blow, I\ngot his head into the bear’s jaws, and the creature being still\nsomewhat alive and convulsive, the teeth closed upon him like\nnutcrackers. I threw the bear from me, but the Nareskin remained\nsprawling, unable to extricate his head from the bear’s jaws,\nimploring for mercy. I gave the wretch his life: a lion preys not\nupon carcases.",
        "At the same time my troop had effectually routed the bears and the\nrest of their adversaries. I was merciful, and ordered quarter to be\ngiven.",
        "At that moment I perceived Wauwau flying at a great height through the\nheavens, and we instantly set out in pursuit of her, and never stopped\nuntil we arrived at Kamschatka; thence we passed to Otaheite. I met my\nold acquaintance Omai, who had been in England with the great\nnavigator, Cook, and I was glad to find he had established Sunday\nschools over all the islands. I talked to him of Europe, and his\nformer voyage to England. “Ah!” said he, most emphatically, “the\nEnglish, the cruel English, to murder me with goodness, and refine\nupon my torture–took me to Europe, and showed me the court of\nEngland, the delicacy of exquisite life; they showed me gods, and\nshowed me heaven, as if on purpose to make me feel the loss of them.”",
        "From these islands we set out, attended by a fleet of canoes with\nfighting-stages and the chiefest warriors of the islands, commanded by\nOmai. Thus the chariot of Queen Mab, my team of bulls and the\ncrickets, the ark, the Sphinx, and the balloons, with Hilaro\nFrosticos, Gog and Magog, Lord Whittington, and the Lord Mayor’s show,\nDon Quixote, &c., with my fleet of canoes, altogether cut a very\nformidable appearance on our arrival at the Isthmus of Darien.\nSensible of what general benefit it would be to mankind, I immediately\nformed a plan of cutting a canal across the isthmus from sea to sea.",
        "For this purpose I drove my chariot with the greatest impetuosity\nrepeatedly from shore to shore, in the same track, tearing up the\nrocks and earth thereby, and forming a tolerable bed for the water.\nGog and Magog next advanced at the head of a million of people from\nthe realms of North and South America, and from Europe, and with\ninfinite labour cleared away the earth, &c., that I had ploughed up\nwith my chariot. I then again drove my chariot, making the canal wider\nand deeper, and ordered Gog and Magog to repeat their labour as\nbefore. The canal being a quarter of a mile broad, and three hundred\nyards in depth, I thought it sufficient, and immediately let in the\nwaters of the sea. I did imagine, that from the rotatory motion of the\nearth on its axis from west to east the sea would be higher on the\neastern than the western coast, and that on the uniting of the two\nseas there would be a strong current from the east, and it happened\njust as I expected. The sea came in with tremendous magnificence, and\nenlarged the bounds of the canal, so as to make a passage of some\nmiles broad from ocean to ocean, and make an island of South America.\nSeveral sail of trading vessels and men-of-war sailed through this new\nchannel to the South Seas, China, &c., and saluted me with all their\ncannon as they passed.",
        "I looked through my telescope at the moon, and perceived the\nphilosophers there in great commotion. They could plainly discern the\nalteration on the surface of our globe, and thought themselves somehow\ninterested in the enterprise of their fellow-mortals in a neighbouring\nplanet. They seemed to think it admirable that such little beings as\nwe men should attempt so magnificent a performance, that would be\nobservable even in a separate world.",
        "Thus having wedded the Atlantic Ocean to the South Sea, I returned to\nEngland, and found Wauwau precisely in the very spot whence she had\nset out, after having led us a chase all round the world.",
        "  The Baron goes to Petersburgh, and converses with the Empress–\n  Persuades the Russians and Turks to cease cutting one another’s\n  throats, and in concert cut a canal across the Isthmus of Suez–\n  The Baron discovers the Alexandrine Library, and meets with Hermes\n  Trismegistus–Besieges Seringapatam, and challenges Tippoo Sahib\n  to single combat–They fight–The Baron receives some wounds to\n  his face, but at last vanquishes the tyrant–The Baron returns to\n  Europe, and raises the hull of the “Royal George.”",
        "Seized with a fury of canal-cutting, I took it in my head to form an\nimmediate communication between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, and\ntherefore set out for Petersburgh.",
        "The sanguinary ambition of the Empress would not listen to my\nproposals, until I took a private opportunity, taking a cup of coffee\nwith her Majesty, to tell her that I would absolutely sacrifice myself\nfor the general good of mankind, and if she would accede to my\nproposals, would, on the completion of the canal, ipso facto, give\nher my hand in marriage!",
        "“My dear, dear Baron,” said she, “I accede to everything you please,\nand agree to make peace with the Porte on the conditions you mention.\nAnd,” added she, rising with all the majesty of the Czarina, Empress\nof half the world, “be it known to all subjects, that We ordain these\nconditions, for such is our royal will and pleasure.”",
        "I now proceeded to the Isthmus of Suez, at the head of a million of\nRussian pioneers, and there united my forces with a million of Turks,\narmed with shovels and pickaxes. They did not come to cut each other’s\nthroats, but for their mutual interest, to facilitate commerce and\ncivilisation, and pour all the wealth of India by a new channel into\nEurope. “My brave fellows,” said I, “consider the immense labour of\nthe Chinese to build their celebrated wall; think of what superior\nbenefit to mankind is our present undertaking; persevere, and fortune\nwill second your endeavours. Remember it is Munchausen who leads you\non, and be convinced of success.”",
        "Saying these words, I drove my chariot with all my might in my former\ntrack, that vestige mentioned by the Baron de Tott, and when I was\nadvanced considerably, I felt my chariot sinking under me. I attempted\nto drive on, but the ground, or rather immense vault, giving way, my\nchariot and all went down precipitately. Stunned by the fall, it was\nsome moments before I could recollect myself, when at length, to my\namazement, I perceived myself fallen into the Alexandrine Library,\noverwhelmed in an ocean of books; thousands of volumes came tumbling\non my head amidst the ruins of that part of the vault through which my\nchariot had descended, and for a time buried my bulls and all beneath\na heap of learning. However, I contrived to extricate myself, and\nadvanced with awful admiration through the vast avenues of the\nlibrary. I perceived on every side innumerable volumes and\nrepositories of ancient learning, and all the science of the\nAntediluvian world. Here I met with Hermes Trismegistus, and a parcel\nof old philosophers debating upon the politics and learning of their\ndays. I gave them inexpressible delight in telling them, in a few\nwords, all the discoveries of Newton, and the history of the world\nsince their time. These gentry, on the contrary, told me a thousand\nstories of antiquity that some of our antiquarians would give their\nvery eyes to hear.",
        "In short, I ordered the library to be preserved, and I intend making a\npresent of it, as soon as it arrives in England, to the Royal Society,\ntogether with Hermes Trismegistus, and half a dozen old philosophers.\nI have got a beautiful cage made, in which I keep these extraordinary\ncreatures, and feed them with bread and honey, as they seem to believe\nin a kind of doctrine of transmigration, and will not touch flesh.\nHermes Trismegistus especially is a most antique looking being, with a\nbeard half a yard long, covered with a robe of golden embroidery, and\nprates like a parrot. He will cut a very brilliant figure in the\nMuseum.",
        "Having made a track with my chariot from sea to sea, I ordered my\nTurks and Russians to begin, and in a few hours we had the pleasure of\nseeing a fleet of British East Indiamen in full sail through the\ncanal. The officers of this fleet were very polite, and paid me every\napplause and congratulation my exploits could merit. They told me of\ntheir affairs in India, and the ferocity of that dreadful warrior,\nTippoo Sahib, on which I resolved to go to India and encounter the\ntyrant. I travelled down the Red Sea to Madras, and at the head of a\nfew Sepoys and Europeans pursued the flying army of Tippoo to the\ngates of Seringapatam. I challenged him to mortal combat, and, mounted\non my steed, rode up to the walls of the fortress amidst a storm of\nshells and cannon-balls. As fast as the bombs and cannon-balls came\nupon me, I caught them in my hands like so many pebbles, and throwing\nthem against the fortress, demolished the strongest ramparts of the\nplace. I took my mark so direct, that whenever I aimed a cannon-ball\nor a shell at any person on the ramparts I was sure to hit him: and\none time perceiving a tremendous piece of artillery pointed against\nme, and knowing the ball must be so great it would certainly stun me,\nI took a small cannon-ball, and just as I perceived the engineer going\nto order them to fire, and opening his mouth to give the word of\ncommand, I took aim and drove my ball precisely down his throat.",
        "Tippoo, fearing that all would be lost, that a general and successful\nstorm would ensue if I continued to batter the place, came forth upon\nhis elephant to fight me; I saluted him, and insisted he should fire\nfirst.",
        "Tippoo, though a barbarian, was not deficient in politeness, and\ndeclined the compliment; upon which I took off my hat, and bowing,\ntold him it was an advantage Munchausen should never be said to accept\nfrom so gallant a warrior: on which Tippoo instantly discharged his\ncarbine, the ball from which, hitting my horse’s ear, made him plunge\nwith rage and indignation. In return I discharged my pistol at Tippoo,\nand shot off his turban. He had a small field-piece mounted with him\non his elephant, which he then discharged at me, and the grape-shot\ncoming in a shower, rattled in the laurels that covered and shaded me\nall over, and remained pendant like berries on the branches. I then,\nadvancing, took the proboscis of his elephant, and turning it against\nthe rider, struck him repeatedly with the extremity of it on either\nside of the head, until I at length dismounted him. Nothing could\nequal the rage of the barbarian finding himself thrown from his\nelephant. He rose in a fit of despair, and rushed against my steed and\nmyself: but I scorned to fight him at so great a disadvantage on his\nside, and directly dismounted to fight him hand to hand. Never did I\nfight with any man who bore himself more nobly than this adversary; he\nparried my blows, and dealt home his own in return with astonishing\nprecision. The first blow of his sabre I received upon the bridge of\nmy nose, and but for the bony firmness of that part of my face, it\nwould have descended to my mouth. I still bear the mark upon my nose.",
        "He next made a furious blow at my head, but I, parrying, deadened the\nforce of his sabre, so that I received but one scar on my forehead,\nand at the same instant, by a blow of my sword, cut off his arm, and\nhis hand and sabre fell to the earth; he tottered for some paces, and\ndropped at the foot of his elephant. That sagacious animal, seeing the\ndanger of his master, endeavoured to protect him by flourishing his\nproboscis round the head of the Sultan.",
        "Fearless I advanced against the elephant, desirous to take alive the\nhaughty Tippoo Sahib; but he drew a pistol from his belt, and\ndischarged it full in my face as I rushed upon him, which did me no\nfurther harm than wound my cheek-bone, which disfigures me somewhat\nunder my left eye. I could not withstand the rage and impulse of that\nmoment, and with one blow of my sword separated his head from his\nbody.",
        "I returned overland from India to Europe with admirable velocity, so\nthat the account of Tippoo’s defeat by me has not as yet arrived by\nthe ordinary passage, nor can you expect to hear of it for a\nconsiderable time. I simply relate the encounter as it happened\nbetween the Sultan and me; and if there be any one who doubts the\ntruth of what I say, he is an infidel, and I will fight him at any\ntime and place, and with any weapon he pleases.",
        "Hearing so many persons talk about raising the “Royal George,” I began\nto take pity on that fine old ruin of British plank, and determined to\nhave her up. I was sensible of the failure of the various means\nhitherto employed for the purpose, and therefore inclined to try a\nmethod different from any before attempted. I got an immense balloon,\nmade of the toughest sail-cloth, and having descended in my diving-\nbell, and properly secured the hull with enormous cables, I ascended\nto the surface, and fastened my cables to the balloon. Prodigious\nmultitudes were assembled to behold the elevation of the “Royal\nGeorge,” and as soon as I began to fill my balloon with inflammable\nair the vessel evidently began to move: but when my balloon was\ncompletely filled, she carried up the “Royal George” with the greatest\nrapidity. The vessel appearing on the surface occasioned a universal\nshout of triumph from the millions assembled on the occasion. Still\nthe balloon continued ascending, trailing the hull after like a\nlantern at the tail of a kite, and in a few minutes appeared floating\namong the clouds.",
        "It was then the opinion of many philosophers that it would be more\ndifficult to get her down then it had been to draw her up. But I\nconvinced them to the contrary by taking my aim so exactly with a\ntwelve-pounder, that I brought her down in an instant.",
        "I considered, that if I should break the balloon with a cannon-ball\nwhile she remained with the vessel over the land, the fall would\ninevitable occasion the destruction of the hull, and which, in its\nfall, might crush some of the multitude; therefore I thought it safer\nto take my aim when the balloon was over the sea, and pointing my\ntwelve-pounder, drove the ball right through the balloon, on which the\ninflammable air rushed out with great force, and the “Royal George\"\ndescended like a falling star into the very spot from whence she had\nbeen taken. There she still remains, and I have convinced all Europe\nof the possibility of taking her up.",
        "  The Baron makes a speech to the National Assembly, and drives out\n  all the members–Routs the fishwomen and the National Guards–\n  Pursues the whole rout into a Church, where he defeats the\n  National Assembly, &c., with Rousseau, Voltaire, and Beelzebub at\n  their head, and liberates Marie Antoinette and the Royal Family.",
        "Passing through Switzerland on my return from India, I was informed\nthat several of the German nobility had been deprived of the honours\nand immunities of their French estates. I heard of the sufferings of\nthe amiable Marie Antoinette, and swore to avenge every look that had\nthreatened her with insult. I went to the cavern of these\nAnthropophagi, assembled to debate, and gracefully putting the hilt of\nmy sword to my lips–\"I swear,” cried I, “by the sacred cross of my\nsword, that if you do not instantly reinstate your king and his\nnobility, and your injured queen, I will cut the one half of you to\npieces.”",
        "On which the President, taking up a leaden inkstand, flung it at my\nhead. I stooped to avoid the blow, and rushing to the tribunal seized\nthe Speaker, who was fulminating against the Aristocrats, and taking\nthe creature by one leg, flung him at the President. I laid about me\nmost nobly, drove them all out of the house, and locking the doors put\nthe key in my pocket.",
        "I then went to the poor king, and making my obeisance to him–\"Sire,\"\nsaid I, “your enemies have all fled. I alone am the National Assembly\nat present, and I shall register your edicts to recall the princes and\nthe nobility; and in future, if your majesty pleases, I will be your\nParliament and Council.” He thanked me, and the amiable Marie\nAntoinette, smiling, gave me her hand to kiss.",
        "At that moment I perceived a party of the National Assembly, who had\nrallied with the National Guards, and a vast procession of fishwomen,\nadvancing against me. I deposited their Majesties in a place of\nsafety, and with my drawn sword advanced against my foes. Three\nhundred fishwomen, with bushes dressed with ribbons in their hands,\ncame hallooing and roaring against me like so many furies. I scorned\nto defile my sword with their blood, but seized the first that came\nup, and making her kneel down I knighted her with my sword, which so\nterrified the rest that they all set up a frightful yell and ran away\nas fast as they could for fear of being aristocrated by knighthood.",
        "As to the National Guards and the rest of the Assembly, I soon put\nthem to flight; and having made prisoners of some of them, compelled\nthem to take down their national, and put the old royal cockade in its\nplace.",
        "I then pursued the enemy to the top of a hill, where a most noble\nedifice dazzled my sight; noble and sacred it was but now converted to\nthe vilest purposes, their monument de grands hommes, a Christian\nchurch that these Saracens had perverted into abomination. I burst\nopen the doors, and entered sword in hand. Here I observed all the\nNational Assembly marching round a great altar erected to Voltaire;\nthere was his statue in triumph, and the fishwomen with garlands\ndecking it, and singing “Ca ira!” I could bear the sight no longer;\nbut rushed upon these pagans, and sacrificed them by dozens on the\nspot. The members of the Assembly, and the fishwomen, continued to\ninvoke their great Voltaire, and all their masters in this monument\nde grands hommes, imploring them to come down and succour them\nagainst the Aristocrats and the sword of Munchausen. Their cries were\nhorrible, like the shrieks of witches and enchanters versed in magic\nand the black art, while the thunder growled, and storms shook the\nbattlements, and Rousseau, Voltaire, and Beelzebub appeared, three\nhorrible spectres; one all meagre, mere skin and bone, and cadaverous,\nseemed death, that hideous skeleton; it was Voltaire, and in his hand\nwere a lyre and a dagger. On the other side was Rousseau, with a\nchalice of sweet poison in his hand, and between them was their father\nBeelzebub!",
        "I shuddered at the sight, and with all the enthusiasm of rage, horror,\nand piety, rushed in among them. I seized that cursed skeleton\nVoltaire, and soon compelled him to renounce all the errors he had\nadvanced; and while he spoke the words, as if by magic charm, the\nwhole assembly shrieked, and the pandemonium began to tumble in\nhideous ruin on their heads.",
        "I returned in triumph to the palace, where the Queen rushed into my\narms, weeping tenderly. “Ah, thou flower of nobility,” cried she,\n\"were all the nobles of France like thee, we should never have been\nbrought to this!”",
        "I bade the lovely creature dry her eyes, and with the King and Dauphin\nascend my carriage, and drive post to Mont-Medi, as not an instant was\nto be lost. They took my advice and drove away. I conveyed them within\na few miles of Mont-Medi, when the King, thanking me for my\nassistance, hoped I would not trouble myself any farther, as he was\nthen, he presumed, out of danger; and the Queen also, with tears in\nher eyes, thanked me on her knees, and presented the Dauphin for my\nblessing. In short, I left the King eating a mutton chop. I advised\nhim not to delay, or he would certainly be taken, and setting spurs to\nmy horse, wished them a good evening, and returned to England. If the\nKing remained too long at table, and was taken, it was not my fault.",
