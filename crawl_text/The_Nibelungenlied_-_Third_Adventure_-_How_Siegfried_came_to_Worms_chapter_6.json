        "Seldom in sooth, if ever, / the hero’s heart was sad.\nHe heard them tell the story, / how that a winsome maid\nThere lived afar in Burgundy, / surpassing fair to see:\nGreat joy she brought him later, / but eke she brought him misery.",
        "45",
        "Of her exceeding beauty / the fame spread far and near,\nAnd of the thing, moreover, / were knights oft-times aware\nHow the maid’s high spirit / no mortal could command:\nThe thing lured many a stranger / from far unto King Gunther’s land.",
        "46",
        "Although to win her favor / were many wooers bent,\nIn her own heart would never / Kriemhild thereto consent\nThat any one amongst them / for lover she would have:\nStill to her was he a stranger / to whom anon her troth she gave.",
        "47",
        "To true love turned his fancy / the son of Siegelind.\n’Gainst his, all others’ wooing / was like an idle wind:\nFull well did he merit / a lady fair to woo,\nAnd soon the noble Kriemhild / to Siegfried bold was wedded true.",
        "48",
        "By friends he oft was counselled, / and many a faithful man,\nSince to think of wooing / in earnest he began,\nThat he a wife should find him / of fitting high degree.\nThen spoke the noble Siegfried: / “In sooth fair Kriemhild shall it be,",
        "49",
        "“The noble royal maiden / in Burgundy that dwells,\nFor sake of all her beauty. / Of her the story tells,\nNe’er monarch was so mighty / that, if for spouse he sighed,\n’Twere not for him befitting / to take the princess for his bride.”",
        "50",
        "Unto King Siegmund also / the thing was soon made known.\nHis people talked about it, / whereby to him was shown\nThe Prince’s fixed purpose. / It grieved him sorely, too,\nThat his son intent was / the full stately maid to woo.",
        "51",
        "Siegelind asked and learned it, / the noble monarch’s wife.\nFor her loved son she sorrowed / lest he should lose his life,\nFor well she knew the humor / of Gunther and his men.\nThen gan they from the wooing / strive to turn the noble thane.",
        "52",
        "Then said the doughty Siegfried: / “O father dear to me,\nWithout the love of woman / would I ever be,\nCould I not woo in freedom / where’er my heart is set.\nWhate’er be said by any, / I’ll keep the selfsame purpose yet.”",
        "53",
        "“Since thou wilt not give over,\" / the king in answer said,\n“Am I of this thy purpose / inwardly full glad,\nAnd straightway to fulfil it / I’ll help as best I can,\nYet in King Gunther’s service / is many a haughty-minded man.",
        "54",
        "“And were there yet none other / than Hagen, warrior-knight,\nHe with such haughty bearing / is wont to show his might,\nThat I do fear right sorely / that sad our end may be,\nIf we set out with purpose / to win the stately maid for thee.”",
        "55",
        "“Shall we by that be hindered?\" / outspake Siegfried then;\n“Whate’er in friendly fashion / I cannot obtain\nI’ll yet in other manner / take that, with sword in hand.\nI trow from them I’ll further / wrest both their vassals and their land.”",
        "56",
        "“I grieve to hear thy purpose,\" / said Siegmund the king;\n“If any one this story / unto the Rhine should bring,\nThen durst thou never after / within that land be seen.\nGunther and Gernot, / –well known to me they long have been.",
        "57",
        "“By force, however mighty, / no man can win the maid,\"\nSpake King Siegmund further, / “to me hath oft been said.\nBut if with knightly escort / thither thou wilt ride,\nGood friends–an have we any– / shall soon be summoned to thy side.”",
        "58",
        "“No wish,” then answered Siegfried, / “it ever was of mine,\nThat warrior knights should follow / with me unto the Rhine\nAs if arrayed for battle: / ’twould make my heart full sad,\nTo force in hostile manner / to yield to me the stately maid.",
        "59",
        "“By my own hand–thus only– / trust I to win my bride;\nWith none but twelve in company / to Gunther’s land I’ll ride.\nIn this, O royal father, / thy present help I pray.\"\nGray and white fur raiment / had his companions for the way.",
        "60",
        "Siegelind his mother / then heard the story too,\nAnd grieved she was on hearing / what her dear son would do,\nFor she did fear to lose him / at hands of Gunther’s men.\nThereat with heart full heavy / began to weep the noble queen.",
        "61",
        "Then came forth Sir Siegfried / where the queen he sought,\nAnd to his weeping mother / thus gently spake his thought:\n“No tear of grief thou shouldest / ever shed for me,\nFor I care not a tittle / for all the warriors that be.",
        "62",
        "“So help me on my journey / to the land of Burgundy,\nAnd furnish such apparel / for all my knights and me,\nAs warriors of our station / might well with honor wear.\nThen I in turn right truly / to thee my gratitude will swear.”",
        "63",
        "“Since thou wilt not give over,\" / Siegelind then replied,\n“My only son, I’ll help thee / as fits thee forth to ride,\nWith the best apparel / that riders ever wore,\nThee and thy companions: / ye shall of all have goodly store.”",
        "64",
        "Then bowed the youthful Siegfried / the royal dame before,\nAnd said: “Upon the journey / will I take no more,\nBut twelve good knights only: / for these rich dress provide,\nFor I would know full gladly / how ’t doth with Kriemhild betide.”",
        "65",
        "Then sat at work fair women / by night and eke by day,\nAnd rest indeed but little / from busy toil had they,\nUntil they had made ready / the dress Siegfried should wear.\nFirm bent upon the journey, / no other counsel would he hear.",
        "66",
        "His father bade a costly / garb for him prepare,\nThat leaving Siegmund’s country / he the same might wear.\nFor all their glittering breastplates / were soon prepared beside,\nAnd helmets firmly welded, / and shining shields long and wide.",
        "67",
        "Then fast the day grew nearer / when they should thence depart.\nMen and likewise women / went sorrowing in heart,\nIf that they should ever / see more their native land.\nWith full equipment laden / the sumpter horses there did stand.",
        "68",
        "Their steeds were stately, furnished / with trappings rich with gold;\nIt were a task all bootless / to seek for knights more bold\nThan were the gallant Siegfried / and his chosen band.\nHe longed to take departure / straightway for Burgundian land.",
        "69",
        "Leave granted they with sadness, / both the king and queen,\nThe which to turn to gladness / sought the warrior keen,\nAnd spake then: “Weep ye shall not / at all for sake of me,\nForever free from doubtings / about my safety may ye be.”",
        "70",
        "Stern warriors stood there sorrowing, / –in tears was many a maid.\nI ween their hearts erred nothing, / as sad forebodings said\nThat ’mongst their friends so many / thereby were doomed to die.\nGood cause had they to sorrow / at last o’er all their misery.",
        "71",
        "Upon the seventh morning / to Worms upon the strand\nDid come the keen knights riding. / Bright shone many a band\nOf gold from their apparel / and rich equipment then;\nAnd gently went their chargers / with Siegfried and his chosen men.",
        "72",
        "New-made shields they carried / that were both strong and wide\nAnd brightly shone their helmets / as thus to court did ride\nSiegfried the keen warrior / into King Gunther’s land.\nOf knights before was never / beheld so richly clad a band.",
        "73",
        "The points of their long scabbards / reached down unto the spur,\nAnd spear full sharply pointed / bore each chosen warrior.\nThe one that Siegfried carried / in breadth was two good span,\nAnd grimly cut its edges / when driven by the fearless man.",
        "74",
        "Reins with gold all gleaming / held they in the hand,\nThe saddle-bands were silken. / So came they to the land.\nOn every side the people / to gape at them began,\nAnd also out to meet them / the men that served King Gunther ran.",
        "75",
        "Gallant men high-hearted, / knight and squire too,\nHastened to receive them, / for such respect was due,\nAnd bade the guests be welcome / unto their master’s land.\nThey took from them their chargers, / and shields as well from out the\n      hand.",
        "76",
        "Then would they eke the chargers / lead forth unto their rest;\nBut straight the doughty Siegfried / to them these words addressed:\n“Yet shall ye let our chargers / stand the while near by;\nSoon take we hence our journey; / thereon resolved full well am I.",
        "77",
        "“If that be known to any, / let him not delay,\nWhere I your royal master / now shall find, to say,–\nGunther, king so mighty / o’er the land of Burgundy.\"\nThen told him one amongst them / to whom was known where that might be:",
        "78",
        "“If that the king thou seekest, / right soon may he be found.\nWithin that wide hall yonder / with his good knights around\nBut now I saw him sitting. / Thither do thou repair,\nAnd thou may’st find around him / many a stately warrior there.”",
        "79",
        "Now also to the monarch / were the tidings told,\nThat within his castle / were knights arrived full bold,\nAll clad in shining armor / and apparelled gorgeously;\nBut not a man did know them / within the land of Burgundy.",
        "80",
        "Thereat the king did wonder / whence were come to him\nThese knights adventure seeking / in dress so bright and trim,\nAnd shields adorned so richly / that new and mighty were.\nThat none the thing could tell him / did grieve him sorely to hear.",
        "81",
        "Outspake a knight then straightway, / Ortwein by name was he,\nStrong and keen as any / well was he known to be:\n“Since we of them know nothing, / bid some one quickly go\nAnd fetch my uncle Hagen: / to him thou shalt the strangers show.",
        "82",
        "“To him are known far kingdoms / and every foreign land,\nAnd if he know these strangers / we soon shall understand.\"\nThe king then sent to fetch him: / with his train of men\nUnto the king’s high presence / in stately gear went he then.",
        "83",
        "What were the king’s good pleasure, / asked Hagen grim in war.\n“In the court within my castle / are warriors from afar,\nAnd no one here doth know them: / if them thou e’er didst see\nIn any land far distant, / now shalt thou, Hagen, tell to me.”",
        "84",
        "“That will I do, ’tis certain.\"– / To a window then he went,\nAnd on the unknown strangers / his keen eye he bent.\nWell pleased him their equipment / and the rich dress they wore,\nYet ne’er had he beheld them / in land of Burgundy before.",
        "85",
        "He said that whencesoever / these knights come to the Rhine,\nThey bear a royal message, / or are of princely line.\n“Their steeds are so bedizened, / and their apparel rare:\nNo matter whence they journey, / high-hearted men in truth they are.”",
        "86",
        "Further then spake Hagen: / “As far as goes my ken,\nThough I the noble Siegfried / yet have never seen,\nYet will I say meseemeth, / howe’er the thing may be,\nThis knight who seeks adventure, / and yonder stands so proud, is he.",
        "87",
        "“’Tis some new thing he bringeth / hither to our land.\nThe valiant Nibelungen / fell by the hero’s hand,\nSchilbung and Nibelung, / from royal sire sprung;\nDeeds he wrought most wondrous / anon when his strong arm he swung.",
        "88",
        "“As once alone the hero / rode without company,\nFound he before a mountain / –as hath been told to me–\nWith the hoard of Nibelung / full many stalwart men;\nTo him had they been strangers / until he chanced to find them then.",
        "89",
        "“The hoard of King Nibelung / entire did they bear\nForth from a mountain hollow. / And now the wonder hear,\nHow that they would share it, / these two Nibelung men.\nThis saw the fearless Siegfried, / and filled he was with wonder then.",
        "90",
        "“He came so near unto them / that he the knights espied,\nAnd they in turn him also. / One amongst them said:\n’Here comes the doughty Siegfried, / hero of Netherland.’\nSince ’mongst the Nibelungen / strange wonders wrought his mighty hand.",
        "91",
        "“Right well did they receive him, / Schilbung and Nibelung,\nAnd straight they both together, / these noble princes young,\nBade him mete out the treasure, / the full valorous man,\nAnd so long time besought him / that he at last the task began.",
        "92",
        "“As we have heard in story, / he saw of gems such store\nThat they might not be laden / on wagons full five score;\nMore still of gold all shining / from Nibelungenland.\n’Twas all to be divided / between them by keen Siegfried’s hand.",
        "93",
        "“Then gave they him for hire / King Nibelung’s sword.\nAnd sooth to say, that service / brought them but small reward,\nThat for them there performed / Siegfried of dauntless mood.\nHis task he could not finish; / thereat they raged as were they wood.",
        "94",
        "“They had there of their followers / twelve warriors keen,\nAnd strong they were as giants: / what booted giants e’en?\nThem slew straightway in anger / Siegfried’s mighty hand,\nAnd warriors seven hundred / he felled in Nibelungenland",
        "95",
        "“With the sword full trusty, / Balmung that hight.\nFull many a youthful warrior / from terror at the sight\nOf that deadly weapon / swung by his mighty hand\nDid render up his castle / and pledge him fealty in the land.",
        "96",
        "“Thereto the kings so mighty, / them slew he both as well.\nBut into gravest danger / through Alberich he fell,\nWho thought for his slain masters / vengeance to wreak straightway,\nUntil the mighty Siegfried / his wrath with strong arm did stay.",
        "97",
        "“Nor could prevail against him / the Dwarf, howe’er he tried.\nE’en as two wild lions / they coursed the mountainside,\nWhere he the sightless mantle[1] / from Alberich soon won.\nThen Siegfried, knight undaunted, / held the treasure for his own.",
        "[1] This is the tarnkappe, a cloak that made the wearer invisible,\n    and also gave him the strength of twelve men.",
        "98",
        "“Who then dared join the struggle, / all slain around they lay.\nThen he bade the treasure / to draw and bear away\nThither whence ’twas taken / by the Nibelungen men.\nAlberich for his valor / was then appointed Chamberlain.",
        "99",
        "“An oath he had to swear him, / he’d serve him as his slave;\nTo do all kinds of service / his willing pledge he gave\"–\nThus spake of Tronje Hagen– / “That has the hero done;\nMight as great before him / was never in a warrior known.",
        "100",
        "“Still know I more about him, / that has to me been told.\nA dragon, wormlike monster, / slew once the hero bold.\nThen in its blood he bathed him, / since when his skin hath been\nSo horn-hard, ne’er a weapon / can pierce it, as hath oft been seen.",
        "101",
        "“Let us the brave knight-errant / receive so courteously\nThat we in nought shall merit / his hate, for strong is he.\nHe is so keen of spirit / he must be treated fair:\nHe has by his own valor / done many a deed of prowess rare.”",
        "102",
        "The monarch spake in wonder: / “In sooth thou tellest right.\nNow see how proudly yonder / he stands prepared for fight,\nHe and his thanes together, / the hero wondrous keen!\nTo greet him we’ll go thither, / and let our fair intent be seen.”",
        "103",
        "“That canst thou,” out spake Hagen, / “well in honor do.\nHe is of noble kindred, / a high king’s son thereto.\n’Tis seen in all his bearing; / meseems in truth, God wot,\nThe tale is worth the hearing / that this bold knight has hither\n      brought.”",
        "104",
        "Then spake the mighty monarch: / “Be he right welcome here.\nKeen is he and noble, / of fame known far and near.\nSo shall he be fair treated / in the land of Burgundy.\"\nDown then went King Gunther, / and Siegfried with his men found he.",
        "105",
        "The king and his knights with him / received so well the guest,\nThat the hearty greeting / did their good will attest.\nThereat in turn the stranger / in reverence bowed low,\nThat in their welcome to him / they did such courtesy bestow.",
        "106",
        "“To me it is a wonder,\" / straightway spake the host,\n“From whence, O noble Siegfried, / come to our land thou dost,\nOr what here thou seekest / at Worms upon the Rhine.\"\nHim the stranger answered: / “Put thou away all doubts of thine.",
        "107",
        "“I oft have heard the tiding / within my sire’s domain,\nHow at thy court resided / –and know this would I fain–\nKnights, of all the keenest, / –’tis often told me so–\nThat e’er a monarch boasted: / now come I hither this to know.",
        "108",
        "“Thyself have I heard also / high praised for knightly worth;\n’Tis said a nobler monarch / ne’er lived in all the earth.\nThus speak of thee the people / in all the lands around.\nNor will I e’er give over / until in this the truth I’ve found.",
        "109",
        "“I too am warrior noble / and born to wear a crown;\nSo would I right gladly / that thou of me shouldst own\nThat I of right am master / o’er people and o’er land.\nOf this shall now my honor / and eke my head as pledges stand.",
        "110",
        "“And art thou then so valiant / as hath to me been told,\nI reck not, will he nill he / thy best warrior bold,\nI’ll wrest from thee in combat / whatever thou may’st have;\nThy lands and all thy castles / shall naught from change of masters\n      save.”",
        "111",
        "The king was seized with wonder / and all his men beside,\nTo see the manner haughty / in which the knight replied\nThat he was fully minded / to take from him his land.\nIt chafed his thanes to hear it, / who soon in raging mood did stand.",
        "112",
        "“How could it be my fortune,\" / Gunther the king outspoke,\n“What my sire long ruled over / in honor for his folk,\nNow to lose so basely / through any vaunter’s might?\nIn sooth ’twere nobly showing / that we too merit name of knight!”",
        "113",
        "“Nowise will I give over,\" / was the keen reply.\n“If peace through thine own valor / thy land cannot enjoy,\nTo me shall all be subject: / if heritage of mine\nThrough thy arm’s might thou winnest, / of right shall all hence-forth be\n      thine.",
        "114",
        "“Thy land and all that mine is, / at stake shall equal lie.\nWhiche’er of us be victor / when now our strength we try,\nTo him shall all be subject, / the folk and eke the land.\"\nBut Hagen spake against it, / and Gernot too was quick at hand.",
        "115",
        "“Such purpose have we never,\" / Gernot then said,\n“For lands to combat ever, / that any warrior dead\nShould lie in bloody battle. / We’ve mighty lands and strong;\nOf right they call us master, / and better they to none belong.”",
        "116",
        "There stood full grim and moody / Gernot’s friends around,\nAnd there as well amongst them / was Ortwein to be found.\nHe spake: “This mild peace-making / doth grieve me sore at heart,\nFor by the doughty Siegfried / attacked all undeserved thou art.",
        "117",
        "“If thou and thy two brothers / yourselves to help had naught,\nAnd if a mighty army / he too had hither brought,\nI trow I’d soon be able / to make this man so keen\nHis manner now so haughty / of need replace by meeker mien.”",
        "118",
        "Thereat did rage full sorely / the hero of Netherland:\n“Never shall be measured / ’gainst me in fight thy hand.\nI am a mighty monarch, / thou a king’s serving-knight;\nOf such as thou a dozen / dare not withstand me in the fight.”",
        "119",
        "For swords then called in anger / of Metz Sir Ortwein:\nSon of Hagen’s sister / he was, of Tronje’s line.\nThat Hagen so long was silent / did grieve the king to see.\nGernot made peace between them: / a gallant knight and keen was he.",
        "120",
        "Spake he thus to Ortwein: / “Curb now thy wrathful tongue,\nFor here the noble Siegfried / hath done us no such wrong;\nWe yet can end the quarrel / in peace,–such is my rede–\nAnd live with him in friendship; / that were for us a worthier deed.”",
        "121",
        "Then spake the mighty Hagen: / “Sad things do I forebode\nFor all thy train of warriors, / that this knight ever rode\nUnto the Rhine thus armed. / ’Twere best he stayed at home;\nFor from my masters never / to him such wrong as this had come.”",
        "122",
        "But outspake Siegfried proudly, / whose heart was ne’er dismayed:\n“An’t please thee not, Sir Hagen, / what I now have said,\nThis arm shall give example / whereby thou plain shall see\nHow stern anon its power / here in Burgundy will be.”",
        "123",
        "“Yet that myself will hinder,\" / said then Gernot.\nAll his men forbade he / henceforth to say aught\nWith such unbridled spirit / to stir the stranger’s ire.\nThen Siegfried eke was mindful / of one most stately maid and fair.",
        "124",
        "“Such strife would ill befit us,\" / Gernot spake again;\n“For though should die in battle / a host of valiant men\n’Twould bring us little honor / and ye could profit none.\"\nThereto gave Siegfried answer, / good King Siegmund’s noble son:",
        "125",
        "“Wherefore bides thus grim Hagen, / and Ortwein tardy is\nTo begin the combat / with all those friends of his,\nOf whom he hath so many / here in Burgundy?\"\nAnswer him they durst not, / for such was Gernot’s stern decree.",
        "126",
        "“Thou shalt to us be welcome,\" / outspake young Giselher,\n“And all thy brave companions / that hither with thee fare.\nFull gladly we’ll attend thee, / I and all friends of mine.\"\nFor the guests then bade they / pour out in store of Gunther’s wine.",
        "127",
        "Then spake the stately monarch: / “But ask thou courteously,\nAnd all that we call ours / stands at thy service free;\nSo with thee our fortune / we’ll share in ill and good.\"\nThereat the noble Siegfried / a little milder was of mood.",
        "128",
        "Then carefully was tended / all their knightly gear,\nAnd housed in goodly manner / in sooth the strangers were,\nAll that followed Siegfried; / they found a welcome rest.\nIn Burgundy full gladly / anon was seen the noble guest.",
        "129",
        "They showed him mickle honor / thereafter many a day,\nAnd more by times a thousand / than I to you could say.\nHis might respect did merit, / ye may full well know that.\nScarce a man e’er saw him / who bore him longer any hate.",
        "130",
        "And when they held their pastime, / the kings with many a man,\nThen was he ever foremost; / whatever they began,\nNone there that was his equal, / –so mickle was his might–\nIf they the stone were putting, / or hurling shaft with rival knight.",
        "131",
        "As is the knightly custom, / before the ladies fair\nTo games they turned for pastime, / these knights of mettle rare;\nThen ever saw they gladly / the hero of Netherland.\nBut he had fixed his fancy / to win one fairest maiden’s hand.",
        "132",
        "In all that they were doing / he’d take a ready part.\nA winsome loving maiden / he bore within his heart;\nHim only loved that lady, / whose face he ne’er had seen,\nBut she full oft in secret / of him spake fairest words, I ween.",
        "133",
        "And when before the castle / they sped in tournament,\nThe good knights and squires, / oft-times the maiden went\nAnd gazed adown from casement, / Kriemhild the princess rare.\nPastime there was none other / for her that could with this compare.",
        "134",
        "And knew he she was gazing / whom in his heart he bore,\nHe joy enough had found him / in jousting evermore.\nAnd might he only see her, / –that can I well believe–\nOn earth through sight none other / his eyes could such delight receive.",
        "135",
        "Whene’er with his companions / to castle court he went,\nE’en as do now the people / whene’er on pleasure bent,\nThere stood ’fore all so graceful / Siegelind’s noble son,\nFor whom in love did languish / the hearts of ladies many a one.",
        "136",
        "Eke thought he full often: / “How shall it ever be,\nThat I the noble maiden / with my own eyes may see,\nWhom I do love so dearly / and have for many a day?\nTo me is she a stranger, / which sorely grieves my heart to say.”",
        "137",
        "Whene’er the kings so mighty / rode o’er their broad domain,\nThen of valiant warriors / they took a stately train.\nWith them abroad rode Siegfried, / which grieved those ladies sore:\n–He too for one fair maiden / at heart a mickle burden bore.",
        "138",
