        "from whom I first learned the pragmatic openness of mind and whom my\nfancy likes to picture as our leader were he alive to-day.",
        "The lectures that follow were delivered at the Lowell Institute in\nBoston in November and December, 1906, and in January, 1907, at\nColumbia University, in New York. They are printed as delivered,\nwithout developments or notes. The pragmatic movement, so-called–I\ndo not like the name, but apparently it is too late to change it–\nseems to have rather suddenly precipitated itself out of the air. A\nnumber of tendencies that have always existed in philosophy have all\nat once become conscious of themselves collectively, and of their\ncombined mission; and this has occurred in so many countries, and\nfrom so many different points of view, that much unconcerted\nstatement has resulted. I have sought to unify the picture as it\npresents itself to my own eyes, dealing in broad strokes, and\navoiding minute controversy. Much futile controversy might have been\navoided, I believe, if our critics had been willing to wait until we\ngot our message fairly out.",
        "If my lectures interest any reader in the general subject, he will\ndoubtless wish to read farther. I therefore give him a few\nreferences.",
        "In America, John Dewey’s ’Studies in Logical Theory’ are the\nfoundation. Read also by Dewey the articles in the Philosophical\nReview, vol. xv, pp. 113 and 465, in Mind, vol. xv, p. 293, and in\nthe Journal of Philosophy, vol. iv, p. 197.",
        "Probably the best statements to begin with however, are F. C. S.\nSchiller’s in his ’Studies in Humanism,’ especially the essays\nnumbered i, v, vi, vii, xviii and xix. His previous essays and in\ngeneral the polemic literature of the subject are fully referred to\nin his footnotes.",
        "Furthermore, see G. Milhaud: le Rationnel, 1898, and the fine\narticles by Le Roy in the Revue de Metaphysique, vols. 7, 8 and 9.\nAlso articles by Blondel and de Sailly in the Annales de Philosophie\nChretienne, 4me Serie, vols. 2 and 3. Papini announces a book on\nPragmatism, in the French language, to be published very soon.",
        "To avoid one misunderstanding at least, let me say that there is no\nlogical connexion between pragmatism, as I understand it, and a\ndoctrine which I have recently set forth as ’radical empiricism.’\nThe latter stands on its own feet. One may entirely reject it and\nstill be a pragmatist.",
        "Harvard University, April, 1907.",
        "In the preface to that admirable collection of essays of his called\n’Heretics,’ Mr. Chesterton writes these words: “There are some\npeople–and I am one of them–who think that the most practical and\nimportant thing about a man is still his view of the universe. We\nthink that for a landlady considering a lodger, it is important to\nknow his income, but still more important to know his philosophy. We\nthink that for a general about to fight an enemy, it is important to\nknow the enemy’s numbers, but still more important to know the\nenemy’s philosophy. We think the question is not whether the theory\nof the cosmos affects matters, but whether, in the long run,\nanything else affects them.”",
        "I think with Mr. Chesterton in this matter. I know that you, ladies\nand gentlemen, have a philosophy, each and all of you, and that the\nmost interesting and important thing about you is the way in which\nit determines the perspective in your several worlds. You know the\nsame of me. And yet I confess to a certain tremor at the audacity of\nthe enterprise which I am about to begin. For the philosophy which\nis so important in each of us is not a technical matter; it is our\nmore or less dumb sense of what life honestly and deeply means. It\nis only partly got from books; it is our individual way of just\nseeing and feeling the total push and pressure of the cosmos. I have\nno right to assume that many of you are students of the cosmos in\nthe class-room sense, yet here I stand desirous of interesting you\nin a philosophy which to no small extent has to be technically\ntreated. I wish to fill you with sympathy with a contemporaneous\ntendency in which I profoundly believe, and yet I have to talk like\na professor to you who are not students. Whatever universe a\nprofessor believes in must at any rate be a universe that lends\nitself to lengthy discourse. A universe definable in two sentences\nis something for which the professorial intellect has no use. No\nfaith in anything of that cheap kind! I have heard friends and\ncolleagues try to popularize philosophy in this very hall, but they\nsoon grew dry, and then technical, and the results were only\npartially encouraging. So my enterprise is a bold one. The founder\nof pragmatism himself recently gave a course of lectures at the\nLowell Institute with that very word in its title-flashes of\nbrilliant light relieved against Cimmerian darkness! None of us, I\nfancy, understood ALL that he said–yet here I stand, making a very\nsimilar venture.",
        "I risk it because the very lectures I speak of DREW–they brought\ngood audiences. There is, it must be confessed, a curious\nfascination in hearing deep things talked about, even tho neither we\nnor the disputants understand them. We get the problematic thrill,\nwe feel the presence of the vastness. Let a controversy begin in a\nsmoking-room anywhere, about free-will or God’s omniscience, or good\nand evil, and see how everyone in the place pricks up his ears.\nPhilosophy’s results concern us all most vitally, and philosophy’s\nqueerest arguments tickle agreeably our sense of subtlety and\ningenuity.",
        "Believing in philosophy myself devoutly, and believing also that a\nkind of new dawn is breaking upon us philosophers, I feel impelled,\nper fas aut nefas, to try to impart to you some news of the\nsituation.",
        "Philosophy is at once the most sublime and the most trivial of human\npursuits. It works in the minutest crannies and it opens out the\nwidest vistas. It ’bakes no bread,’ as has been said, but it can\ninspire our souls with courage; and repugnant as its manners, its\ndoubting and challenging, its quibbling and dialectics, often are to\ncommon people, no one of us can get along without the far-flashing\nbeams of light it sends over the world’s perspectives. These\nilluminations at least, and the contrast-effects of darkness and\nmystery that accompany them, give to what it says an interest that\nis much more than professional.",
        "The history of philosophy is to a great extent that of a certain\nclash of human temperaments. Undignified as such a treatment may\nseem to some of my colleagues, I shall have to take account of this\nclash and explain a good many of the divergencies of philosophers by\nit. Of whatever temperament a professional philosopher is, he tries\nwhen philosophizing to sink the fact of his temperament. Temperament\nis no conventionally recognized reason, so he urges impersonal\nreasons only for his conclusions. Yet his temperament really gives\nhim a stronger bias than any of his more strictly objective\npremises. It loads the evidence for him one way or the other, making\nfor a more sentimental or a more hard-hearted view of the universe,\njust as this fact or that principle would. He trusts his\ntemperament. Wanting a universe that suits it, he believes in any\nrepresentation of the universe that does suit it. He feels men of\nopposite temper to be out of key with the world’s character, and in\nhis heart considers them incompetent and ’not in it,’ in the\nphilosophic business, even tho they may far excel him in dialectical\nability.",
        "Yet in the forum he can make no claim, on the bare ground of his\ntemperament, to superior discernment or authority. There arises thus\na certain insincerity in our philosophic discussions: the potentest\nof all our premises is never mentioned. I am sure it would\ncontribute to clearness if in these lectures we should break this\nrule and mention it, and I accordingly feel free to do so.",
        "Of course I am talking here of very positively marked men, men of\nradical idiosyncracy, who have set their stamp and likeness on\nphilosophy and figure in its history. Plato, Locke, Hegel, Spencer,\nare such temperamental thinkers. Most of us have, of course, no very\ndefinite intellectual temperament, we are a mixture of opposite\ningredients, each one present very moderately. We hardly know our\nown preferences in abstract matters; some of us are easily talked\nout of them, and end by following the fashion or taking up with the\nbeliefs of the most impressive philosopher in our neighborhood,\nwhoever he may be. But the one thing that has COUNTED so far in\nphilosophy is that a man should see things, see them straight in his\nown peculiar way, and be dissatisfied with any opposite way of\nseeing them. There is no reason to suppose that this strong\ntemperamental vision is from now onward to count no longer in the\nhistory of man’s beliefs.",
        "Now the particular difference of temperament that I have in mind in\nmaking these remarks is one that has counted in literature, art,\ngovernment and manners as well as in philosophy. In manners we find\nformalists and free-and-easy persons. In government, authoritarians\nand anarchists. In literature, purists or academicals, and realists.\nIn art, classics and romantics. You recognize these contrasts as\nfamiliar; well, in philosophy we have a very similar contrast\nexpressed in the pair of terms ’rationalist’ and ’empiricist,’\n’empiricist’ meaning your lover of facts in all their crude variety,\n’rationalist’ meaning your devotee to abstract and eternal\nprinciples. No one can live an hour without both facts and\nprinciples, so it is a difference rather of emphasis; yet it breeds\nantipathies of the most pungent character between those who lay the\nemphasis differently; and we shall find it extraordinarily\nconvenient to express a certain contrast in men’s ways of taking\ntheir universe, by talking of the ’empiricist’ and of the\n’rationalist’ temper. These terms make the contrast simple and\nmassive.",
        "More simple and massive than are usually the men of whom the terms\nare predicated. For every sort of permutation and combination is\npossible in human nature; and if I now proceed to define more fully\nwhat I have in mind when I speak of rationalists and empiricists, by\nadding to each of those titles some secondary qualifying\ncharacteristics, I beg you to regard my conduct as to a certain\nextent arbitrary. I select types of combination that nature offers\nvery frequently, but by no means uniformly, and I select them solely\nfor their convenience in helping me to my ulterior purpose of\ncharacterizing pragmatism. Historically we find the terms\n’intellectualism’ and ’sensationalism’ used as synonyms of\n’rationalism’ and ’empiricism.’ Well, nature seems to combine most\nfrequently with intellectualism an idealistic and optimistic\ntendency. Empiricists on the other hand are not uncommonly\nmaterialistic, and their optimism is apt to be decidedly conditional\nand tremulous. Rationalism is always monistic. It starts from wholes\nand universals, and makes much of the unity of things. Empiricism\nstarts from the parts, and makes of the whole a collection-is not\naverse therefore to calling itself pluralistic. Rationalism usually\nconsiders itself more religious than empiricism, but there is much\nto say about this claim, so I merely mention it. It is a true claim\nwhen the individual rationalist is what is called a man of feeling,\nand when the individual empiricist prides himself on being hard-\nheaded. In that case the rationalist will usually also be in favor\nof what is called free-will, and the empiricist will be a fatalist–\nI use the terms most popularly current. The rationalist finally will\nbe of dogmatic temper in his affirmations, while the empiricist may\nbe more sceptical and open to discussion.",
        "I will write these traits down in two columns. I think you will\npractically recognize the two types of mental make-up that I mean if\nI head the columns by the titles ’tender-minded’ and ’tough-minded’\nrespectively.",
        "Rationalistic (going by ’principles’),\nIntellectualistic,\nIdealistic,\nOptimistic,\nReligious,\nFree-willist,\nMonistic,\nDogmatical.",
        "Empiricist (going by ’facts’),\nSensationalistic,\nMaterialistic,\nPessimistic,\nIrreligious,\nFatalistic,\nPluralistic,\nSceptical.",
        "Pray postpone for a moment the question whether the two contrasted\nmixtures which I have written down are each inwardly coherent and\nself-consistent or not–I shall very soon have a good deal to say on\nthat point. It suffices for our immediate purpose that tender-minded\nand tough-minded people, characterized as I have written them down,\ndo both exist. Each of you probably knows some well-marked example\nof each type, and you know what each example thinks of the example\non the other side of the line. They have a low opinion of each\nother. Their antagonism, whenever as individuals their temperaments\nhave been intense, has formed in all ages a part of the philosophic\natmosphere of the time. It forms a part of the philosophic\natmosphere to-day. The tough think of the tender as sentimentalists\nand soft-heads. The tender feel the tough to be unrefined, callous,\nor brutal. Their mutual reaction is very much like that that takes\nplace when Bostonian tourists mingle with a population like that of\nCripple Creek. Each type believes the other to be inferior to\nitself; but disdain in the one case is mingled with amusement, in\nthe other it has a dash of fear.",
        "Now, as I have already insisted, few of us are tender-foot\nBostonians pure and simple, and few are typical Rocky Mountain\ntoughs, in philosophy. Most of us have a hankering for the good\nthings on both sides of the line. Facts are good, of course–give us\nlots of facts. Principles are good–give us plenty of principles.\nThe world is indubitably one if you look at it in one way, but as\nindubitably is it many, if you look at it in another. It is both one\nand many–let us adopt a sort of pluralistic monism. Everything of\ncourse is necessarily determined, and yet of course our wills are\nfree: a sort of free-will determinism is the true philosophy. The\nevil of the parts is undeniable; but the whole can’t be evil: so\npractical pessimism may be combined with metaphysical optimism. And\nso forth–your ordinary philosophic layman never being a radical,\nnever straightening out his system, but living vaguely in one\nplausible compartment of it or another to suit the temptations of\nsuccessive hours.",
        "But some of us are more than mere laymen in philosophy. We are\nworthy of the name of amateur athletes, and are vexed by too much\ninconsistency and vacillation in our creed. We cannot preserve a\ngood intellectual conscience so long as we keep mixing incompatibles\nfrom opposite sides of the line.",
        "And now I come to the first positively important point which I wish\nto make. Never were as many men of a decidedly empiricist proclivity\nin existence as there are at the present day. Our children, one may\nsay, are almost born scientific. But our esteem for facts has not\nneutralized in us all religiousness. It is itself almost religious.\nOur scientific temper is devout. Now take a man of this type, and\nlet him be also a philosophic amateur, unwilling to mix a hodge-\npodge system after the fashion of a common layman, and what does he\nfind his situation to be, in this blessed year of our Lord 1906? He\nwants facts; he wants science; but he also wants a religion. And\nbeing an amateur and not an independent originator in philosophy he\nnaturally looks for guidance to the experts and professionals whom\nhe finds already in the field. A very large number of you here\npresent, possibly a majority of you, are amateurs of just this sort.",
        "Now what kinds of philosophy do you find actually offered to meet\nyour need? You find an empirical philosophy that is not religious\nenough, and a religious philosophy that is not empirical enough for\nyour purpose. If you look to the quarter where facts are most\nconsidered you find the whole tough-minded program in operation, and\nthe ’conflict between science and religion’ in full blast. Either it\nis that Rocky Mountain tough of a Haeckel with his materialistic\nmonism, his ether-god and his jest at your God as a ’gaseous\nvertebrate’; or it is Spencer treating the world’s history as a\nredistribution of matter and motion solely, and bowing religion\npolitely out at the front door:–she may indeed continue to exist,\nbut she must never show her face inside the temple. For a hundred\nand fifty years past the progress of science has seemed to mean the\nenlargement of the material universe and the diminution of man’s\nimportance. The result is what one may call the growth of\nnaturalistic or positivistic feeling. Man is no law-giver to nature,\nhe is an absorber. She it is who stands firm; he it is who must\naccommodate himself. Let him record truth, inhuman tho it be, and\nsubmit to it! The romantic spontaneity and courage are gone, the\nvision is materialistic and depressing. Ideals appear as inert by-\nproducts of physiology; what is higher is explained by what is lower\nand treated forever as a case of ’nothing but’–nothing but\nsomething else of a quite inferior sort. You get, in short, a\nmaterialistic universe, in which only the tough-minded find\nthemselves congenially at home.",
        "If now, on the other hand, you turn to the religious quarter for\nconsolation, and take counsel of the tender-minded philosophies,\nwhat do you find?",
        "Religious philosophy in our day and generation is, among us English-\nreading people, of two main types. One of these is more radical and\naggressive, the other has more the air of fighting a slow retreat.\nBy the more radical wing of religious philosophy I mean the so-\ncalled transcendental idealism of the Anglo-Hegelian school, the\nphilosophy of such men as Green, the Cairds, Bosanquet, and Royce.\nThis philosophy has greatly influenced the more studious members of\nour protestant ministry. It is pantheistic, and undoubtedly it has\nalready blunted the edge of the traditional theism in protestantism\nat large.",
        "That theism remains, however. It is the lineal descendant, through\none stage of concession after another, of the dogmatic scholastic\ntheism still taught rigorously in the seminaries of the catholic\nchurch. For a long time it used to be called among us the philosophy\nof the Scottish school. It is what I meant by the philosophy that\nhas the air of fighting a slow retreat. Between the encroachments of\nthe hegelians and other philosophers of the ’Absolute,’ on the one\nhand, and those of the scientific evolutionists and agnostics, on\nthe other, the men that give us this kind of a philosophy, James\nMartineau, Professor Bowne, Professor Ladd and others, must feel\nthemselves rather tightly squeezed. Fair-minded and candid as you\nlike, this philosophy is not radical in temper. It is eclectic, a\nthing of compromises, that seeks a modus vivendi above all things.\nIt accepts the facts of darwinism, the facts of cerebral physiology,\nbut it does nothing active or enthusiastic with them. It lacks the\nvictorious and aggressive note. It lacks prestige in consequence;\nwhereas absolutism has a certain prestige due to the more radical\nstyle of it.",
        "These two systems are what you have to choose between if you turn to\nthe tender-minded school. And if you are the lovers of facts I have\nsupposed you to be, you find the trail of the serpent of\nrationalism, of intellectualism, over everything that lies on that\nside of the line. You escape indeed the materialism that goes with\nthe reigning empiricism; but you pay for your escape by losing\ncontact with the concrete parts of life. The more absolutistic\nphilosophers dwell on so high a level of abstraction that they never\neven try to come down. The absolute mind which they offer us, the\nmind that makes our universe by thinking it, might, for aught they\nshow us to the contrary, have made any one of a million other\nuniverses just as well as this. You can deduce no single actual\nparticular from the notion of it. It is compatible with any state of\nthings whatever being true here below. And the theistic God is\nalmost as sterile a principle. You have to go to the world which he\nhas created to get any inkling of his actual character: he is the\nkind of god that has once for all made that kind of a world. The God\nof the theistic writers lives on as purely abstract heights as does\nthe Absolute. Absolutism has a certain sweep and dash about it,\nwhile the usual theism is more insipid, but both are equally remote\nand vacuous. What you want is a philosophy that will not only\nexercise your powers of intellectual abstraction, but that will make\nsome positive connexion with this actual world of finite human\nlives.",
        "You want a system that will combine both things, the scientific\nloyalty to facts and willingness to take account of them, the spirit\nof adaptation and accommodation, in short, but also the old\nconfidence in human values and the resultant spontaneity, whether of\nthe religious or of the romantic type. And this is then your\ndilemma: you find the two parts of your quaesitum hopelessly\nseparated. You find empiricism with inhumanism and irreligion; or\nelse you find a rationalistic philosophy that indeed may call itself\nreligious, but that keeps out of all definite touch with concrete\nfacts and joys and sorrows.",
        "I am not sure how many of you live close enough to philosophy to\nrealize fully what I mean by this last reproach, so I will dwell a\nlittle longer on that unreality in all rationalistic systems by\nwhich your serious believer in facts is so apt to feel repelled.",
        "I wish that I had saved the first couple of pages of a thesis which\na student handed me a year or two ago. They illustrated my point so\nclearly that I am sorry I cannot read them to you now. This young\nman, who was a graduate of some Western college, began by saying\nthat he had always taken for granted that when you entered a\nphilosophic class-room you had to open relations with a universe\nentirely distinct from the one you left behind you in the street.\nThe two were supposed, he said, to have so little to do with each\nother, that you could not possibly occupy your mind with them at the\nsame time. The world of concrete personal experiences to which the\nstreet belongs is multitudinous beyond imagination, tangled, muddy,\npainful and perplexed. The world to which your philosophy-professor\nintroduces you is simple, clean and noble. The contradictions of\nreal life are absent from it. Its architecture is classic.\nPrinciples of reason trace its outlines, logical necessities cement\nits parts. Purity and dignity are what it most expresses. It is a\nkind of marble temple shining on a hill.",
        "In point of fact it is far less an account of this actual world than\na clear addition built upon it, a classic sanctuary in which the\nrationalist fancy may take refuge from the intolerably confused and\ngothic character which mere facts present. It is no EXPLANATION of\nour concrete universe, it is another thing altogether, a substitute\nfor it, a remedy, a way of escape.",
        "Its temperament, if I may use the word temperament here, is utterly\nalien to the temperament of existence in the concrete. REFINEMENT is\nwhat characterizes our intellectualist philosophies. They\nexquisitely satisfy that craving for a refined object of\ncontemplation which is so powerful an appetite of the mind. But I\nask you in all seriousness to look abroad on this colossal universe\nof concrete facts, on their awful bewilderments, their surprises and\ncruelties, on the wildness which they show, and then to tell me\nwhether ’refined’ is the one inevitable descriptive adjective that\nsprings to your lips.",
        "Refinement has its place in things, true enough. But a philosophy\nthat breathes out nothing but refinement will never satisfy the\nempiricist temper of mind. It will seem rather a monument of\nartificiality. So we find men of science preferring to turn their\nbacks on metaphysics as on something altogether cloistered and\nspectral, and practical men shaking philosophy’s dust off their feet\nand following the call of the wild.",
        "Truly there is something a little ghastly in the satisfaction with\nwhich a pure but unreal system will fill a rationalist mind.\nLeibnitz was a rationalist mind, with infinitely more interest in\nfacts than most rationalist minds can show. Yet if you wish for\nsuperficiality incarnate, you have only to read that charmingly\nwritten ’Theodicee’ of his, in which he sought to justify the ways\nof God to man, and to prove that the world we live in is the best of\npossible worlds. Let me quote a specimen of what I mean.",
        "Among other obstacles to his optimistic philosophy, it falls to\nLeibnitz to consider the number of the eternally damned. That it is\ninfinitely greater, in our human case, than that of those saved he\nassumes as a premise from the theologians, and then proceeds to\nargue in this way. Even then, he says:",
        "“The evil will appear as almost nothing in comparison with the good,\nif we once consider the real magnitude of the City of God. Coelius\nSecundus Curio has written a little book, ’De Amplitudine Regni\nCoelestis,’ which was reprinted not long ago. But he failed to\ncompass the extent of the kingdom of the heavens. The ancients had\nsmall ideas of the works of God. ... It seemed to them that only our\nearth had inhabitants, and even the notion of our antipodes gave\nthem pause. The rest of the world for them consisted of some shining\nglobes and a few crystalline spheres. But to-day, whatever be the\nlimits that we may grant or refuse to the Universe we must recognize\nin it a countless number of globes, as big as ours or bigger, which\nhave just as much right as it has to support rational inhabitants,\ntho it does not follow that these need all be men. Our earth is only\none among the six principal satellites of our sun. As all the fixed\nstars are suns, one sees how small a place among visible things our\nearth takes up, since it is only a satellite of one among them. Now\nall these suns MAY be inhabited by none but happy creatures; and\nnothing obliges us to believe that the number of damned persons is\nvery great; for a VERY FEW INSTANCES AND SAMPLES SUFFICE FOR THE\nUTILITY WHICH GOOD DRAWS FROM EVIL. Moreover, since there is no\nreason to suppose that there are stars everywhere, may there not be\na great space beyond the region of the stars? And this immense\nspace, surrounding all this region, ... may be replete with\nhappiness and glory. ... What now becomes of the consideration of\nour Earth and of its denizens? Does it not dwindle to something\nincomparably less than a physical point, since our Earth is but a\npoint compared with the distance of the fixed stars. Thus the part\nof the Universe which we know, being almost lost in nothingness\ncompared with that which is unknown to us, but which we are yet\nobliged to admit; and all the evils that we know lying in this\nalmost-nothing; it follows that the evils may be almost-nothing in\ncomparison with the goods that the Universe contains.”",
        "Leibnitz continues elsewhere: “There is a kind of justice which aims\nneither at the amendment of the criminal, nor at furnishing an\nexample to others, nor at the reparation of the injury. This justice\nis founded in pure fitness, which finds a certain satisfaction in\nthe expiation of a wicked deed. The Socinians and Hobbes objected to\nthis punitive justice, which is properly vindictive justice and\nwhich God has reserved for himself at many junctures. ... It is\nalways founded in the fitness of things, and satisfies not only the\noffended party, but all wise lookers-on, even as beautiful music or\na fine piece of architecture satisfies a well-constituted mind. It\nis thus that the torments of the damned continue, even tho they\nserve no longer to turn anyone away from sin, and that the rewards\nof the blest continue, even tho they confirm no one in good ways.\nThe damned draw to themselves ever new penalties by their continuing\nsins, and the blest attract ever fresh joys by their unceasing\nprogress in good. Both facts are founded on the principle of\nfitness, ... for God has made all things harmonious in perfection as\nI have already said.”",
        "Leibnitz’s feeble grasp of reality is too obvious to need comment\nfrom me. It is evident that no realistic image of the experience of\na damned soul had ever approached the portals of his mind. Nor had\nit occurred to him that the smaller is the number of ’samples’ of\nthe genus ’lost-soul’ whom God throws as a sop to the eternal\nfitness, the more unequitably grounded is the glory of the blest.\nWhat he gives us is a cold literary exercise, whose cheerful\nsubstance even hell-fire does not warm.",
        "And do not tell me that to show the shallowness of rationalist\nphilosophizing I have had to go back to a shallow wigpated age. The\noptimism of present-day rationalism sounds just as shallow to the\nfact-loving mind. The actual universe is a thing wide open, but\nrationalism makes systems, and systems must be closed. For men in\npractical life perfection is something far off and still in process\nof achievement. This for rationalism is but the illusion of the\nfinite and relative: the absolute ground of things is a perfection\neternally complete.",
        "I find a fine example of revolt against the airy and shallow\noptimism of current religious philosophy in a publication of that\nvaliant anarchistic writer Morrison I. Swift. Mr. Swift’s anarchism\ngoes a little farther than mine does, but I confess that I\nsympathize a good deal, and some of you, I know, will sympathize\nheartily with his dissatisfaction with the idealistic optimisms now\nin vogue. He begins his pamphlet on ’Human Submission’ with a series\nof city reporter’s items from newspapers (suicides, deaths from\nstarvation and the like) as specimens of our civilized regime. For\ninstance:",
        "“’After trudging through the snow from one end of the city to the\nother in the vain hope of securing employment, and with his wife and\nsix children without food and ordered to leave their home in an\nupper east side tenement house because of non-payment of rent, John\nCorcoran, a clerk, to-day ended his life by drinking carbolic acid.\nCorcoran lost his position three weeks ago through illness, and\nduring the period of idleness his scanty savings disappeared.\nYesterday he obtained work with a gang of city snow shovelers, but\nhe was too weak from illness and was forced to quit after an hour’s\ntrial with the shovel. Then the weary task of looking for employment\nwas again resumed. Thoroughly discouraged, Corcoran returned to his\nhome late last night to find his wife and children without food and\nthe notice of dispossession on the door.’ On the following morning\nhe drank the poison.",
        "“The records of many more such cases lie before me [Mr. Swift goes\non]; an encyclopedia might easily be filled with their kind. These\nfew I cite as an interpretation of the universe. ’We are aware of\nthe presence of God in His world,’ says a writer in a recent English\nReview. [The very presence of ill in the temporal order is the\ncondition of the perfection of the eternal order, writes Professor\nRoyce (’The World and the Individual,’ II, 385).] ’The Absolute is\nthe richer for every discord, and for all diversity which it\nembraces,’ says F. H. Bradley (Appearance and Reality, 204). He\nmeans that these slain men make the universe richer, and that is\nPhilosophy. But while Professors Royce and Bradley and a whole host\nof guileless thoroughfed thinkers are unveiling Reality and the\nAbsolute and explaining away evil and pain, this is the condition of\nthe only beings known to us anywhere in the universe with a\ndeveloped consciousness of what the universe is. What these people\nexperience IS Reality. It gives us an absolute phase of the\nuniverse. It is the personal experience of those most qualified in\nall our circle of knowledge to HAVE experience, to tell us WHAT is.\nNow, what does THINKING ABOUT the experience of these persons come\nto compared with directly, personally feeling it, as they feel it?\nThe philosophers are dealing in shades, while those who live and\nfeel know truth. And the mind of mankind-not yet the mind of\nphilosophers and of the proprietary class-but of the great mass of\nthe silently thinking and feeling men, is coming to this view. They\nare judging the universe as they have heretofore permitted the\nhierophants of religion and learning to judge THEM. ...",
        "“This Cleveland workingman, killing his children and himself\n[another of the cited cases], is one of the elemental, stupendous\nfacts of this modern world and of this universe. It cannot be glozed\nover or minimized away by all the treatises on God, and Love, and\nBeing, helplessly existing in their haughty monumental vacuity. This\nis one of the simple irreducible elements of this world’s life after\nmillions of years of divine opportunity and twenty centuries of\nChrist. It is in the moral world like atoms or sub-atoms in the\nphysical, primary, indestructible. And what it blazons to man is the\n... imposture of all philosophy which does not see in such events\nthe consummate factor of conscious experience. These facts\ninvincibly prove religion a nullity. Man will not give religion two\nthousand centuries or twenty centuries more to try itself and waste\nhuman time; its time is up, its probation is ended. Its own record\nends it. Mankind has not sons and eternities to spare for trying out\ndiscredited systems....” [Footnote: Morrison I. Swift, Human\nSubmission, Part Second, Philadelphia, Liberty Press, 1905, pp. 4-\n10.]",
        "Such is the reaction of an empiricist mind upon the rationalist bill\nof fare. It is an absolute ’No, I thank you.’ “Religion,” says Mr.\nSwift, “is like a sleep-walker to whom actual things are blank.” And\nsuch, tho possibly less tensely charged with feeling, is the verdict\nof every seriously inquiring amateur in philosophy to-day who turns\nto the philosophy-professors for the wherewithal to satisfy the\nfulness of his nature’s needs. Empiricist writers give him a\nmaterialism, rationalists give him something religious, but to that\nreligion “actual things are blank.” He becomes thus the judge of us\nphilosophers. Tender or tough, he finds us wanting. None of us may\ntreat his verdicts disdainfully, for after all, his is the typically\nperfect mind, the mind the sum of whose demands is greatest, the\nmind whose criticisms and dissatisfactions are fatal in the long\nrun.",
        "It is at this point that my own solution begins to appear. I offer\nthe oddly-named thing pragmatism as a philosophy that can satisfy\nboth kinds of demand. It can remain religious like the rationalisms,\nbut at the same time, like the empiricisms, it can preserve the\nrichest intimacy with facts. I hope I may be able to leave many of\nyou with as favorable an opinion of it as I preserve myself. Yet, as\nI am near the end of my hour, I will not introduce pragmatism bodily\nnow. I will begin with it on the stroke of the clock next time. I\nprefer at the present moment to return a little on what I have said.",
        "If any of you here are professional philosophers, and some of you I\nknow to be such, you will doubtless have felt my discourse so far to\nhave been crude in an unpardonable, nay, in an almost incredible\ndegree. Tender-minded and tough-minded, what a barbaric disjunction!\nAnd, in general, when philosophy is all compacted of delicate\nintellectualities and subtleties and scrupulosities, and when every\npossible sort of combination and transition obtains within its\nbounds, what a brutal caricature and reduction of highest things to\nthe lowest possible expression is it to represent its field of\nconflict as a sort of rough-and-tumble fight between two hostile\ntemperaments! What a childishly external view! And again, how stupid\nit is to treat the abstractness of rationalist systems as a crime,\nand to damn them because they offer themselves as sanctuaries and\nplaces of escape, rather than as prolongations of the world of\nfacts. Are not all our theories just remedies and places of escape?\nAnd, if philosophy is to be religious, how can she be anything else\nthan a place of escape from the crassness of reality’s surface? What\nbetter thing can she do than raise us out of our animal senses and\nshow us another and a nobler home for our minds in that great\nframework of ideal principles subtending all reality, which the\nintellect divines? How can principles and general views ever be\nanything but abstract outlines? Was Cologne cathedral built without\nan architect’s plan on paper? Is refinement in itself an\nabomination? Is concrete rudeness the only thing that’s true?",
        "Believe me, I feel the full force of the indictment. The picture I\nhave given is indeed monstrously over-simplified and rude. But like\nall abstractions, it will prove to have its use. If philosophers can\ntreat the life of the universe abstractly, they must not complain of\nan abstract treatment of the life of philosophy itself. In point of\nfact the picture I have given is, however coarse and sketchy,\nliterally true. Temperaments with their cravings and refusals do\ndetermine men in their philosophies, and always will. The details of\nsystems may be reasoned out piecemeal, and when the student is\nworking at a system, he may often forget the forest for the single\ntree. But when the labor is accomplished, the mind always performs\nits big summarizing act, and the system forthwith stands over\nagainst one like a living thing, with that strange simple note of\nindividuality which haunts our memory, like the wraith of the man,\nwhen a friend or enemy of ours is dead.",
        "Not only Walt Whitman could write “who touches this book touches a\nman.” The books of all the great philosophers are like so many men.\nOur sense of an essential personal flavor in each one of them,\ntypical but indescribable, is the finest fruit of our own\naccomplished philosophic education. What the system pretends to be\nis a picture of the great universe of God. What it is–and oh so\nflagrantly!–is the revelation of how intensely odd the personal\nflavor of some fellow creature is. Once reduced to these terms (and\nall our philosophies get reduced to them in minds made critical by\nlearning) our commerce with the systems reverts to the informal, to\nthe instinctive human reaction of satisfaction or dislike. We grow\nas peremptory in our rejection or admission, as when a person\npresents himself as a candidate for our favor; our verdicts are\ncouched in as simple adjectives of praise or dispraise. We measure\nthe total character of the universe as we feel it, against the\nflavor of the philosophy proffered us, and one word is enough.",
        "“Statt der lebendigen Natur,” we say, “da Gott die Menschen schuf\nhinein\"–that nebulous concoction, that wooden, that straight-laced\nthing, that crabbed artificiality, that musty schoolroom product,\nthat sick man’s dream! Away with it. Away with all of them!\nImpossible! Impossible!",
        "Our work over the details of his system is indeed what gives us our\nresultant impression of the philosopher, but it is on the resultant\nimpression itself that we react. Expertness in philosophy is\nmeasured by the definiteness of our summarizing reactions, by the\nimmediate perceptive epithet with which the expert hits such complex\nobjects off. But great expertness is not necessary for the epithet\nto come. Few people have definitely articulated philosophies of\ntheir own. But almost everyone has his own peculiar sense of a\ncertain total character in the universe, and of the inadequacy fully\nto match it of the peculiar systems that he knows. They don’t just\ncover HIS world. One will be too dapper, another too pedantic, a\nthird too much of a job-lot of opinions, a fourth too morbid, and a\nfifth too artificial, or what not. At any rate he and we know\noffhand that such philosophies are out of plumb and out of key and\nout of ’whack,’ and have no business to speak up in the universe’s\nname. Plato, Locke, Spinoza, Mill, Caird, Hegel–I prudently avoid\nnames nearer home!–I am sure that to many of you, my hearers, these\nnames are little more than reminders of as many curious personal\nways of falling short. It would be an obvious absurdity if such ways\nof taking the universe were actually true. We philosophers have to\nreckon with such feelings on your part. In the last resort, I\nrepeat, it will be by them that all our philosophies shall\nultimately be judged. The finally victorious way of looking at\nthings will be the most completely IMPRESSIVE way to the normal run\nof minds.",
        "One word more–namely about philosophies necessarily being abstract\noutlines. There are outlines and outlines, outlines of buildings\nthat are FAT, conceived in the cube by their planner, and outlines\nof buildings invented flat on paper, with the aid of ruler and\ncompass. These remain skinny and emaciated even when set up in stone\nand mortar, and the outline already suggests that result. An outline\nin itself is meagre, truly, but it does not necessarily suggest a\nmeagre thing. It is the essential meagreness of WHAT IS SUGGESTED by\nthe usual rationalistic philosophies that moves empiricists to their\ngesture of rejection. The case of Herbert Spencer’s system is much\nto the point here. Rationalists feel his fearful array of\ninsufficiencies. His dry schoolmaster temperament, the hurdy-gurdy\nmonotony of him, his preference for cheap makeshifts in argument,\nhis lack of education even in mechanical principles, and in general\nthe vagueness of all his fundamental ideas, his whole system wooden,\nas if knocked together out of cracked hemlock boards–and yet the\nhalf of England wants to bury him in Westminster Abbey.",
        "Why? Why does Spencer call out so much reverence in spite of his\nweakness in rationalistic eyes? Why should so many educated men who\nfeel that weakness, you and I perhaps, wish to see him in the Abbey\nnotwithstanding?",
        "Simply because we feel his heart to be IN THE RIGHT PLACE\nphilosophically. His principles may be all skin and bone, but at any\nrate his books try to mould themselves upon the particular shape of\nthis, particular world’s carcase. The noise of facts resounds\nthrough all his chapters, the citations of fact never cease, he\nemphasizes facts, turns his face towards their quarter; and that is\nenough. It means the right kind of thing for the empiricist mind.",
        "The pragmatistic philosophy of which I hope to begin talking in my\nnext lecture preserves as cordial a relation with facts, and, unlike\nSpencer’s philosophy, it neither begins nor ends by turning positive\nreligious constructions out of doors–it treats them cordially as\nwell.",
        "I hope I may lead you to find it just the mediating way of thinking\nthat you require.",
        "Some years ago, being with a camping party in the mountains, I\nreturned from a solitary ramble to find everyone engaged in a\nferocious metaphysical dispute. The corpus of the dispute was a\nsquirrel–a live squirrel supposed to be clinging to one side of a\ntree-trunk; while over against the tree’s opposite side a human\nbeing was imagined to stand. This human witness tries to get sight\nof the squirrel by moving rapidly round the tree, but no matter how\nfast he goes, the squirrel moves as fast in the opposite direction,\nand always keeps the tree between himself and the man, so that never\na glimpse of him is caught. The resultant metaphysical problem now\nis this: DOES THE MAN GO ROUND THE SQUIRREL OR NOT? He goes round\nthe tree, sure enough, and the squirrel is on the tree; but does he\ngo round the squirrel? In the unlimited leisure of the wilderness,\ndiscussion had been worn threadbare. Everyone had taken sides, and\nwas obstinate; and the numbers on both sides were even. Each side,\nwhen I appeared, therefore appealed to me to make it a majority.\nMindful of the scholastic adage that whenever you meet a\ncontradiction you must make a distinction, I immediately sought and\nfound one, as follows: “Which party is right,” I said, “depends on\nwhat you PRACTICALLY MEAN by ’going round’ the squirrel. If you mean\npassing from the north of him to the east, then to the south, then\nto the west, and then to the north of him again, obviously the man\ndoes go round him, for he occupies these successive positions. But\nif on the contrary you mean being first in front of him, then on the\nright of him, then behind him, then on his left, and finally in\nfront again, it is quite as obvious that the man fails to go round\nhim, for by the compensating movements the squirrel makes, he keeps\nhis belly turned towards the man all the time, and his back turned\naway. Make the distinction, and there is no occasion for any farther\ndispute. You are both right and both wrong according as you conceive\nthe verb ’to go round’ in one practical fashion or the other.”",
        "Altho one or two of the hotter disputants called my speech a\nshuffling evasion, saying they wanted no quibbling or scholastic\nhair-splitting, but meant just plain honest English ’round,’ the\nmajority seemed to think that the distinction had assuaged the\ndispute.",
        "I tell this trivial anecdote because it is a peculiarly simple\nexample of what I wish now to speak of as THE PRAGMATIC METHOD. The\npragmatic method is primarily a method of settling metaphysical\ndisputes that otherwise might be interminable. Is the world one or\nmany?–fated or free?–material or spiritual?–here are notions\neither of which may or may not hold good of the world; and disputes\nover such notions are unending. The pragmatic method in such cases\nis to try to interpret each notion by tracing its respective\npractical consequences. What difference would it practically make to\nanyone if this notion rather than that notion were true? If no\npractical difference whatever can be traced, then the alternatives\nmean practically the same thing, and all dispute is idle. Whenever a\ndispute is serious, we ought to be able to show some practical\ndifference that must follow from one side or the other’s being\nright.",
        "A glance at the history of the idea will show you still better what\npragmatism means. The term is derived from the same Greek word [pi\nrho alpha gamma mu alpha], meaning action, from which our words\n’practice’ and ’practical’ come. It was first introduced into\nphilosophy by Mr. Charles Peirce in 1878. In an article entitled\n’How to Make Our Ideas Clear,’ in the ’Popular Science Monthly’ for\nJanuary of that year [Footnote: Translated in the Revue\nPhilosophique for January, 1879 (vol. vii).] Mr. Peirce, after\npointing out that our beliefs are really rules for action, said that\nto develope a thought’s meaning, we need only determine what conduct\nit is fitted to produce: that conduct is for us its sole\nsignificance. And the tangible fact at the root of all our thought-\ndistinctions, however subtle, is that there is no one of them so\nfine as to consist in anything but a possible difference of\npractice. To attain perfect clearness in our thoughts of an object,\nthen, we need only consider what conceivable effects of a practical\nkind the object may involve–what sensations we are to expect from\nit, and what reactions we must prepare. Our conception of these\neffects, whether immediate or remote, is then for us the whole of\nour conception of the object, so far as that conception has positive\nsignificance at all.",
        "This is the principle of Peirce, the principle of pragmatism. It lay\nentirely unnoticed by anyone for twenty years, until I, in an\naddress before Professor Howison’s philosophical union at the\nuniversity of California, brought it forward again and made a\nspecial application of it to religion. By that date (1898) the times\nseemed ripe for its reception. The word ’pragmatism’ spread, and at\npresent it fairly spots the pages of the philosophic journals. On\nall hands we find the ’pragmatic movement’ spoken of, sometimes with\nrespect, sometimes with contumely, seldom with clear understanding.\nIt is evident that the term applies itself conveniently to a number\nof tendencies that hitherto have lacked a collective name, and that\nit has ’come to stay.’",
        "To take in the importance of Peirce’s principle, one must get\naccustomed to applying it to concrete cases. I found a few years ago\nthat Ostwald, the illustrious Leipzig chemist, had been making\nperfectly distinct use of the principle of pragmatism in his\nlectures on the philosophy of science, tho he had not called it by\nthat name.",
        "“All realities influence our practice,” he wrote me, “and that\ninfluence is their meaning for us. I am accustomed to put questions\nto my classes in this way: In what respects would the world be\ndifferent if this alternative or that were true? If I can find\nnothing that would become different, then the alternative has no\nsense.”",
        "That is, the rival views mean practically the same thing, and\nmeaning, other than practical, there is for us none. Ostwald in a\npublished lecture gives this example of what he means. Chemists have\nlong wrangled over the inner constitution of certain bodies called\n’tautomerous.’ Their properties seemed equally consistent with the\nnotion that an instable hydrogen atom oscillates inside of them, or\nthat they are instable mixtures of two bodies. Controversy raged;\nbut never was decided. “It would never have begun,” says Ostwald,\n\"if the combatants had asked themselves what particular experimental\nfact could have been made different by one or the other view being\ncorrect. For it would then have appeared that no difference of fact\ncould possibly ensue; and the quarrel was as unreal as if,\ntheorizing in primitive times about the raising of dough by yeast,\none party should have invoked a ’brownie,’ while another insisted on\nan ’elf’ as the true cause of the phenomenon.” [Footnote: ’Theorie\nund Praxis,’ Zeitsch. des Oesterreichischen Ingenieur u.\nArchitecten-Vereines, 1905, Nr. 4 u. 6. I find a still more radical\npragmatism than Ostwald’s in an address by Professor W. S. Franklin:\n\"I think that the sickliest notion of physics, even if a student\ngets it, is that it is ’the science of masses, molecules and the\nether.’ And I think that the healthiest notion, even if a student\ndoes not wholly get it, is that physics is the science of the ways\nof taking hold of bodies and pushing them!” (Science, January 2,\n1903.)]",
        "It is astonishing to see how many philosophical disputes collapse\ninto insignificance the moment you subject them to this simple test\nof tracing a concrete consequence. There can BE no difference any-\nwhere that doesn’t MAKE a difference elsewhere–no difference in\nabstract truth that doesn’t express itself in a difference in\nconcrete fact and in conduct consequent upon that fact, imposed on\nsomebody, somehow, somewhere and somewhen. The whole function of\nphilosophy ought to be to find out what definite difference it will\nmake to you and me, at definite instants of our life, if this world-\nformula or that world-formula be the true one.",
        "There is absolutely nothing new in the pragmatic method. Socrates\nwas an adept at it. Aristotle used it methodically. Locke, Berkeley\nand Hume made momentous contributions to truth by its means.\nShadworth Hodgson keeps insisting that realities are only what they\nare ’known-as.’ But these forerunners of pragmatism used it in\nfragments: they were preluders only. Not until in our time has it\ngeneralized itself, become conscious of a universal mission,\npretended to a conquering destiny. I believe in that destiny, and I\nhope I may end by inspiring you with my belief.",
        "Pragmatism represents a perfectly familiar attitude in philosophy,\nthe empiricist attitude, but it represents it, as it seems to me,\nboth in a more radical and in a less objectionable form than it has\never yet assumed. A pragmatist turns his back resolutely and once\nfor all upon a lot of inveterate habits dear to professional\nphilosophers. He turns away from abstraction and insufficiency, from\nverbal solutions, from bad a priori reasons, from fixed principles,\nclosed systems, and pretended absolutes and origins. He turns\ntowards concreteness and adequacy, towards facts, towards action,\nand towards power. That means the empiricist temper regnant, and the\nrationalist temper sincerely given up. It means the open air and\npossibilities of nature, as against dogma, artificiality and the\npretence of finality in truth.",
        "At the same time it does not stand for any special results. It is a\nmethod only. But the general triumph of that method would mean an\nenormous change in what I called in my last lecture the\n’temperament’ of philosophy. Teachers of the ultra-rationalistic\ntype would be frozen out, much as the courtier type is frozen out in\nrepublics, as the ultramontane type of priest is frozen out in\nprotestant lands. Science and metaphysics would come much nearer\ntogether, would in fact work absolutely hand in hand.",
        "Metaphysics has usually followed a very primitive kind of quest. You\nknow how men have always hankered after unlawful magic, and you know\nwhat a great part, in magic, WORDS have always played. If you have\nhis name, or the formula of incantation that binds him, you can\ncontrol the spirit, genie, afrite, or whatever the power may be.\nSolomon knew the names of all the spirits, and having their names,\nhe held them subject to his will. So the universe has always\nappeared to the natural mind as a kind of enigma, of which the key\nmust be sought in the shape of some illuminating or power-bringing\nword or name. That word names the universe’s PRINCIPLE, and to\npossess it is, after a fashion, to possess the universe itself.\n’God,’ ’Matter,’ ’Reason,’ ’the Absolute,’ ’Energy,’ are so many\nsolving names. You can rest when you have them. You are at the end\nof your metaphysical quest.",
        "But if you follow the pragmatic method, you cannot look on any such\nword as closing your quest. You must bring out of each word its\npractical cash-value, set it at work within the stream of your\nexperience. It appears less as a solution, then, than as a program\nfor more work, and more particularly as an indication of the ways in\nwhich existing realities may be CHANGED.",
        "THEORIES THUS BECOME INSTRUMENTS, NOT ANSWERS TO ENIGMAS, IN WHICH\nWE CAN REST. We don’t lie back upon them, we move forward, and, on\noccasion, make nature over again by their aid. Pragmatism unstiffens\nall our theories, limbers them up and sets each one at work. Being\nnothing essentially new, it harmonizes with many ancient philosophic\ntendencies. It agrees with nominalism for instance, in always\nappealing to particulars; with utilitarianism in emphasizing\npractical aspects; with positivism in its disdain for verbal\nsolutions, useless questions, and metaphysical abstractions.",
        "All these, you see, are ANTI-INTELLECTUALIST tendencies. Against\nrationalism as a pretension and a method, pragmatism is fully armed\nand militant. But, at the outset, at least, it stands for no\nparticular results. It has no dogmas, and no doctrines save its\nmethod. As the young Italian pragmatist Papini has well said, it\nlies in the midst of our theories, like a corridor in a hotel.\nInnumerable chambers open out of it. In one you may find a man\nwriting an atheistic volume; in the next someone on his knees\npraying for faith and strength; in a third a chemist investigating a\nbody’s properties. In a fourth a system of idealistic metaphysics is\nbeing excogitated; in a fifth the impossibility of metaphysics is\nbeing shown. But they all own the corridor, and all must pass\nthrough it if they want a practicable way of getting into or out of\ntheir respective rooms.",
        "No particular results then, so far, but only an attitude of\norientation, is what the pragmatic method means. THE ATTITUDE OF\nLOOKING AWAY FROM FIRST THINGS, PRINCIPLES, ’CATEGORIES,’ SUPPOSED\nNECESSITIES; AND OF LOOKING TOWARDS LAST THINGS, FRUITS,\nCONSEQUENCES, FACTS.",
        "So much for the pragmatic method! You may say that I have been\npraising it rather than explaining it to you, but I shall presently\nexplain it abundantly enough by showing how it works on some\nfamiliar problems. Meanwhile the word pragmatism has come to be used\nin a still wider sense, as meaning also a certain theory of TRUTH. I\nmean to give a whole lecture to the statement of that theory, after\nfirst paving the way, so I can be very brief now. But brevity is\nhard to follow, so I ask for your redoubled attention for a quarter\nof an hour. If much remains obscure, I hope to make it clearer in\nthe later lectures.",
        "One of the most successfully cultivated branches of philosophy in\nour time is what is called inductive logic, the study of the\nconditions under which our sciences have evolved. Writers on this\nsubject have begun to show a singular unanimity as to what the laws\nof nature and elements of fact mean, when formulated by\nmathematicians, physicists and chemists. When the first\nmathematical, logical and natural uniformities, the first LAWS, were\ndiscovered, men were so carried away by the clearness, beauty and\nsimplification that resulted, that they believed themselves to have\ndeciphered authentically the eternal thoughts of the Almighty. His\nmind also thundered and reverberated in syllogisms. He also thought\nin conic sections, squares and roots and ratios, and geometrized\nlike Euclid. He made Kepler’s laws for the planets to follow; he\nmade velocity increase proportionally to the time in falling bodies;\nhe made the law of the sines for light to obey when refracted; he\nestablished the classes, orders, families and genera of plants and\nanimals, and fixed the distances between them. He thought the\narchetypes of all things, and devised their variations; and when we\nrediscover any one of these his wondrous institutions, we seize his\nmind in its very literal intention.",
        "But as the sciences have developed farther, the notion has gained\nground that most, perhaps all, of our laws are only approximations.\nThe laws themselves, moreover, have grown so numerous that there is\nno counting them; and so many rival formulations are proposed in all\nthe branches of science that investigators have become accustomed to\nthe notion that no theory is absolutely a transcript of reality, but\nthat any one of them may from some point of view be useful. Their\ngreat use is to summarize old facts and to lead to new ones. They\nare only a man-made language, a conceptual shorthand, as someone\ncalls them, in which we write our reports of nature; and languages,\nas is well known, tolerate much choice of expression and many\ndialects.",
        "Thus human arbitrariness has driven divine necessity from scientific\nlogic. If I mention the names of Sigwart, Mach, Ostwald, Pearson,\nMilhaud, Poincare, Duhem, Ruyssen, those of you who are students\nwill easily identify the tendency I speak of, and will think of\nadditional names.",
        "Riding now on the front of this wave of scientific logic Messrs.\nSchiller and Dewey appear with their pragmatistic account of what\ntruth everywhere signifies. Everywhere, these teachers say, ’truth’\nin our ideas and beliefs means the same thing that it means in\nscience. It means, they say, nothing but this, THAT IDEAS (WHICH\nTHEMSELVES ARE BUT PARTS OF OUR EXPERIENCE) BECOME TRUE JUST IN SO\nFAR AS THEY HELP US TO GET INTO SATISFACTORY RELATION WITH OTHER\nPARTS OF OUR EXPERIENCE, to summarize them and get about among them\nby conceptual short-cuts instead of following the interminable\nsuccession of particular phenomena. Any idea upon which we can ride,\nso to speak; any idea that will carry us prosperously from any one\npart of our experience to any other part, linking things\nsatisfactorily, working securely, simplifying, saving labor; is true\nfor just so much, true in so far forth, true INSTRUMENTALLY. This is\nthe ’instrumental’ view of truth taught so successfully at Chicago,\nthe view that truth in our ideas means their power to ’work,’\npromulgated so brilliantly at Oxford.",
        "Messrs. Dewey, Schiller and their allies, in reaching this general\nconception of all truth, have only followed the example of\ngeologists, biologists and philologists. In the establishment of\nthese other sciences, the successful stroke was always to take some\nsimple process actually observable in operation–as denudation by\nweather, say, or variation from parental type, or change of dialect\nby incorporation of new words and pronunciations–and then to\ngeneralize it, making it apply to all times, and produce great\nresults by summating its effects through the ages.",
        "The observable process which Schiller and Dewey particularly singled\nout for generalization is the familiar one by which any individual\nsettles into NEW OPINIONS. The process here is always the same. The\nindividual has a stock of old opinions already, but he meets a new\nexperience that puts them to a strain. Somebody contradicts them; or\nin a reflective moment he discovers that they contradict each other;\nor he hears of facts with which they are incompatible; or desires\narise in him which they cease to satisfy. The result is an inward\ntrouble to which his mind till then had been a stranger, and from\nwhich he seeks to escape by modifying his previous mass of opinions.\nHe saves as much of it as he can, for in this matter of belief we\nare all extreme conservatives. So he tries to change first this\nopinion, and then that (for they resist change very variously),\nuntil at last some new idea comes up which he can graft upon the\nancient stock with a minimum of disturbance of the latter, some idea\nthat mediates between the stock and the new experience and runs them\ninto one another most felicitously and expediently.",
        "This new idea is then adopted as the true one. It preserves the\nolder stock of truths with a minimum of modification, stretching\nthem just enough to make them admit the novelty, but conceiving that\nin ways as familiar as the case leaves possible. An outree\nexplanation, violating all our preconceptions, would never pass for\na true account of a novelty. We should scratch round industriously\ntill we found something less excentric. The most violent revolutions\nin an individual’s beliefs leave most of his old order standing.\nTime and space, cause and effect, nature and history, and one’s own\nbiography remain untouched. New truth is always a go-between, a\nsmoother-over of transitions. It marries old opinion to new fact so\nas ever to show a minimum of jolt, a maximum of continuity. We hold\na theory true just in proportion to its success in solving this\n’problem of maxima and minima.’ But success in solving this problem\nis eminently a matter of approximation. We say this theory solves it\non the whole more satisfactorily than that theory; but that means\nmore satisfactorily to ourselves, and individuals will emphasize\ntheir points of satisfaction differently. To a certain degree,\ntherefore, everything here is plastic.",
        "The point I now urge you to observe particularly is the part played\nby the older truths. Failure to take account of it is the source of\nmuch of the unjust criticism leveled against pragmatism. Their\ninfluence is absolutely controlling. Loyalty to them is the first\nprinciple–in most cases it is the only principle; for by far the\nmost usual way of handling phenomena so novel that they would make\nfor a serious rearrangement of our preconceptions is to ignore them\naltogether, or to abuse those who bear witness for them.",
        "You doubtless wish examples of this process of truth’s growth, and\nthe only trouble is their superabundance. The simplest case of new\ntruth is of course the mere numerical addition of new kinds of\nfacts, or of new single facts of old kinds, to our experience–an\naddition that involves no alteration in the old beliefs. Day follows\nday, and its contents are simply added. The new contents themselves\nare not true, they simply COME and ARE. Truth is what we say about\nthem, and when we say that they have come, truth is satisfied by the\nplain additive formula.",
        "But often the day’s contents oblige a rearrangement. If I should now\nutter piercing shrieks and act like a maniac on this platform, it\nwould make many of you revise your ideas as to the probable worth of\nmy philosophy. ’Radium’ came the other day as part of the day’s\ncontent, and seemed for a moment to contradict our ideas of the\nwhole order of nature, that order having come to be identified with\nwhat is called the conservation of energy. The mere sight of radium\npaying heat away indefinitely out of its own pocket seemed to\nviolate that conservation. What to think? If the radiations from it\nwere nothing but an escape of unsuspected ’potential’ energy, pre-\nexistent inside of the atoms, the principle of conservation would be\nsaved. The discovery of ’helium’ as the radiation’s outcome, opened\na way to this belief. So Ramsay’s view is generally held to be true,\nbecause, altho it extends our old ideas of energy, it causes a\nminimum of alteration in their nature.",
        "I need not multiply instances. A new opinion counts as ’true’ just\nin proportion as it gratifies the individual’s desire to assimilate\nthe novel in his experience to his beliefs in stock. It must both\nlean on old truth and grasp new fact; and its success (as I said a\nmoment ago) in doing this, is a matter for the individual’s\nappreciation. When old truth grows, then, by new truth’s addition,\nit is for subjective reasons. We are in the process and obey the\nreasons. That new idea is truest which performs most felicitously\nits function of satisfying our double urgency. It makes itself true,\ngets itself classed as true, by the way it works; grafting itself\nthen upon the ancient body of truth, which thus grows much as a tree\ngrows by the activity of a new layer of cambium.",
        "Now Dewey and Schiller proceed to generalize this observation and to\napply it to the most ancient parts of truth. They also once were\nplastic. They also were called true for human reasons. They also\nmediated between still earlier truths and what in those days were\nnovel observations. Purely objective truth, truth in whose\nestablishment the function of giving human satisfaction in marrying\nprevious parts of experience with newer parts played no role\nwhatever, is nowhere to be found. The reasons why we call things\ntrue is the reason why they ARE true, for ’to be true’ MEANS only to\nperform this marriage-function.",
        "The trail of the human serpent is thus over everything. Truth\nindependent; truth that we FIND merely; truth no longer malleable to\nhuman need; truth incorrigible, in a word; such truth exists indeed\nsuperabundantly–or is supposed to exist by rationalistically minded\nthinkers; but then it means only the dead heart of the living tree,\nand its being there means only that truth also has its paleontology\nand its ’prescription,’ and may grow stiff with years of veteran\nservice and petrified in men’s regard by sheer antiquity. But how\nplastic even the oldest truths nevertheless really are has been\nvividly shown in our day by the transformation of logical and\nmathematical ideas, a transformation which seems even to be invading\nphysics. The ancient formulas are reinterpreted as special\nexpressions of much wider principles, principles that our ancestors\nnever got a glimpse of in their present shape and formulation.",
        "Mr. Schiller still gives to all this view of truth the name of\n’Humanism,’ but, for this doctrine too, the name of pragmatism seems\nfairly to be in the ascendant, so I will treat it under the name of\npragmatism in these lectures.",
        "Such then would be the scope of pragmatism–first, a method; and\nsecond, a genetic theory of what is meant by truth. And these two\nthings must be our future topics.",
        "What I have said of the theory of truth will, I am sure, have\nappeared obscure and unsatisfactory to most of you by reason of us\nbrevity. I shall make amends for that hereafter. In a lecture on\n’common sense’ I shall try to show what I mean by truths grown\npetrified by antiquity. In another lecture I shall expatiate on the\nidea that our thoughts become true in proportion as they\nsuccessfully exert their go-between function. In a third I shall\nshow how hard it is to discriminate subjective from objective\nfactors in Truth’s development. You may not follow me wholly in\nthese lectures; and if you do, you may not wholly agree with me. But\nyou will, I know, regard me at least as serious, and treat my effort\nwith respectful consideration.",
        "You will probably be surprised to learn, then, that Messrs.\nSchiller’s and Dewey’s theories have suffered a hailstorm of\ncontempt and ridicule. All rationalism has risen against them. In\ninfluential quarters Mr. Schiller, in particular, has been treated\nlike an impudent schoolboy who deserves a spanking. I should not\nmention this, but for the fact that it throws so much sidelight upon\nthat rationalistic temper to which I have opposed the temper of\npragmatism. Pragmatism is uncomfortable away from facts. Rationalism\nis comfortable only in the presence of abstractions. This pragmatist\ntalk about truths in the plural, about their utility and\nsatisfactoriness, about the success with which they ’work,’ etc.,\nsuggests to the typical intellectualist mind a sort of coarse lame\nsecond-rate makeshift article of truth. Such truths are not real\ntruth. Such tests are merely subjective. As against this, objective\ntruth must be something non-utilitarian, haughty, refined, remote,\naugust, exalted. It must be an absolute correspondence of our\nthoughts with an equally absolute reality. It must be what we OUGHT\nto think, unconditionally. The conditioned ways in which we DO think\nare so much irrelevance and matter for psychology. Down with\npsychology, up with logic, in all this question!",
        "See the exquisite contrast of the types of mind! The pragmatist\nclings to facts and concreteness, observes truth at its work in\nparticular cases, and generalizes. Truth, for him, becomes a class-\nname for all sorts of definite working-values in experience. For the\nrationalist it remains a pure abstraction, to the bare name of which\nwe must defer. When the pragmatist undertakes to show in detail just\nWHY we must defer, the rationalist is unable to recognize the\nconcretes from which his own abstraction is taken. He accuses us of\nDENYING truth; whereas we have only sought to trace exactly why\npeople follow it and always ought to follow it. Your typical ultra-\nabstractionist fairly shudders at concreteness: other things equal,\nhe positively prefers the pale and spectral. If the two universes\nwere offered, he would always choose the skinny outline rather than\nthe rich thicket of reality. It is so much purer, clearer, nobler.",
        "I hope that as these lectures go on, the concreteness and closeness\nto facts of the pragmatism which they advocate may be what approves\nitself to you as its most satisfactory peculiarity. It only follows\nhere the example of the sister-sciences, interpreting the unobserved\nby the observed. It brings old and new harmoniously together. It\nconverts the absolutely empty notion of a static relation of\n’correspondence’ (what that may mean we must ask later) between our\nminds and reality, into that of a rich and active commerce (that\nanyone may follow in detail and understand) between particular\nthoughts of ours, and the great universe of other experiences in\nwhich they play their parts and have their uses.",
        "But enough of this at present? The justification of what I say must\nbe postponed. I wish now to add a word in further explanation of the\nclaim I made at our last meeting, that pragmatism may be a happy\nharmonizer of empiricist ways of thinking, with the more religious\ndemands of human beings.",
        "Men who are strongly of the fact-loving temperament, you may\nremember me to have said, are liable to be kept at a distance by the\nsmall sympathy with facts which that philosophy from the present-day\nfashion of idealism offers them. It is far too intellectualistic.\nOld fashioned theism was bad enough, with its notion of God as an\nexalted monarch, made up of a lot of unintelligible or preposterous\n’attributes’; but, so long as it held strongly by the argument from\ndesign, it kept some touch with concrete realities. Since, however,\ndarwinism has once for all displaced design from the minds of the\n’scientific,’ theism has lost that foothold; and some kind of an\nimmanent or pantheistic deity working IN things rather than above\nthem is, if any, the kind recommended to our contemporary\nimagination. Aspirants to a philosophic religion turn, as a rule,\nmore hopefully nowadays towards idealistic pantheism than towards\nthe older dualistic theism, in spite of the fact that the latter\nstill counts able defenders.",
        "But, as I said in my first lecture, the brand of pantheism offered\nis hard for them to assimilate if they are lovers of facts, or\nempirically minded. It is the absolutistic brand, spurning the dust\nand reared upon pure logic. It keeps no connexion whatever with\nconcreteness. Affirming the Absolute Mind, which is its substitute\nfor God, to be the rational presupposition of all particulars of\nfact, whatever they may be, it remains supremely indifferent to what\nthe particular facts in our world actually are. Be they what they\nmay, the Absolute will father them. Like the sick lion in Esop’s\nfable, all footprints lead into his den, but nulla vestigia\nretrorsum. You cannot redescend into the world of particulars by the\nAbsolute’s aid, or deduce any necessary consequences of detail\nimportant for your life from your idea of his nature. He gives you\nindeed the assurance that all is well with Him, and for his eternal\nway of thinking; but thereupon he leaves you to be finitely saved by\nyour own temporal devices.",
        "Far be it from me to deny the majesty of this conception, or its\ncapacity to yield religious comfort to a most respectable class of\nminds. But from the human point of view, no one can pretend that it\ndoesn’t suffer from the faults of remoteness and abstractness. It is\neminently a product of what I have ventured to call the\nrationalistic temper. It disdains empiricism’s needs. It substitutes\na pallid outline for the real world’s richness. It is dapper; it is\nnoble in the bad sense, in the sense in which to be noble is to be\ninapt for humble service. In this real world of sweat and dirt, it\nseems to me that when a view of things is ’noble,’ that ought to\ncount as a presumption against its truth, and as a philosophic\ndisqualification. The prince of darkness may be a gentleman, as we\nare told he is, but whatever the God of earth and heaven is, he can\nsurely be no gentleman. His menial services are needed in the dust\nof our human trials, even more than his dignity is needed in the\nempyrean.",
        "Now pragmatism, devoted tho she be to facts, has no such\nmaterialistic bias as ordinary empiricism labors under. Moreover,\nshe has no objection whatever to the realizing of abstractions, so\nlong as you get about among particulars with their aid and they\nactually carry you somewhere. Interested in no conclusions but those\nwhich our minds and our experiences work out together, she has no a\npriori prejudices against theology. IF THEOLOGICAL IDEAS PROVE TO\nHAVE A VALUE FOR CONCRETE LIFE, THEY WILL BE TRUE, FOR PRAGMATISM,\nIN THE SENSE OF BEING GOOD FOR SO MUCH. FOR HOW MUCH MORE THEY ARE\nTRUE, WILL DEPEND ENTIRELY ON THEIR RELATIONS TO THE OTHER TRUTHS\nTHAT ALSO HAVE TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED.",
        "What I said just now about the Absolute of transcendental idealism\nis a case in point. First, I called it majestic and said it yielded\nreligious comfort to a class of minds, and then I accused it of\nremoteness and sterility. But so far as it affords such comfort, it\nsurely is not sterile; it has that amount of value; it performs a\nconcrete function. As a good pragmatist, I myself ought to call the\nAbsolute true ’in so far forth,’ then; and I unhesitatingly now do\nso.",
        "But what does TRUE IN SO FAR FORTH mean in this case? To answer, we\nneed only apply the pragmatic method. What do believers in the\nAbsolute mean by saying that their belief affords them comfort? They\nmean that since in the Absolute finite evil is ’overruled’ already,\nwe may, therefore, whenever we wish, treat the temporal as if it\nwere potentially the eternal, be sure that we can trust its outcome,\nand, without sin, dismiss our fear and drop the worry of our finite\nresponsibility. In short, they mean that we have a right ever and\nanon to take a moral holiday, to let the world wag in its own way,\nfeeling that its issues are in better hands than ours and are none\nof our business.",
        "The universe is a system of which the individual members may relax\ntheir anxieties occasionally, in which the don’t-care mood is also\nright for men, and moral holidays in order–that, if I mistake not,\nis part, at least, of what the Absolute is ’known-as,’ that is the\ngreat difference in our particular experiences which his being true\nmakes for us, that is part of his cash-value when he is\npragmatically interpreted. Farther than that the ordinary lay-reader\nin philosophy who thinks favorably of absolute idealism does not\nventure to sharpen his conceptions. He can use the Absolute for so\nmuch, and so much is very precious. He is pained at hearing you\nspeak incredulously of the Absolute, therefore, and disregards your\ncriticisms because they deal with aspects of the conception that he\nfails to follow.",
        "If the Absolute means this, and means no more than this, who can\npossibly deny the truth of it? To deny it would be to insist that\nmen should never relax, and that holidays are never in order. I am\nwell aware how odd it must seem to some of you to hear me say that\nan idea is ’true’ so long as to believe it is profitable to our\nlives. That it is GOOD, for as much as it profits, you will gladly\nadmit. If what we do by its aid is good, you will allow the idea\nitself to be good in so far forth, for we are the better for\npossessing it. But is it not a strange misuse of the word ’truth,’\nyou will say, to call ideas also ’true’ for this reason?",
        "To answer this difficulty fully is impossible at this stage of my\naccount. You touch here upon the very central point of Messrs.\nSchiller’s, Dewey’s and my own doctrine of truth, which I cannot\ndiscuss with detail until my sixth lecture. Let me now say only\nthis, that truth is ONE SPECIES OF GOOD, and not, as is usually\nsupposed, a category distinct from good, and co-ordinate with it.\nTHE TRUE IS THE NAME OF WHATEVER PROVES ITSELF TO BE GOOD IN THE WAY\nOF BELIEF, AND GOOD, TOO, FOR DEFINITE, ASSIGNABLE REASONS. Surely\nyou must admit this, that if there were NO good for life in true\nideas, or if the knowledge of them were positively disadvantageous\nand false ideas the only useful ones, then the current notion that\ntruth is divine and precious, and its pursuit a duty, could never\nhave grown up or become a dogma. In a world like that, our duty\nwould be to SHUN truth, rather. But in this world, just as certain\nfoods are not only agreeable to our taste, but good for our teeth,\nour stomach and our tissues; so certain ideas are not only agreeable\nto think about, or agreeable as supporting other ideas that we are\nfond of, but they are also helpful in life’s practical struggles. If\nthere be any life that it is really better we should lead, and if\nthere be any idea which, if believed in, would help us to lead that\nlife, then it would be really BETTER FOR US to believe in that idea,\nUNLESS, INDEED, BELIEF IN IT INCIDENTALLY CLASHED WITH OTHER GREATER\nVITAL BENEFITS.",
        "’What would be better for us to believe’! This sounds very like a\ndefinition of truth. It comes very near to saying ’what we OUGHT to\nbelieve’: and in THAT definition none of you would find any oddity.\nOught we ever not to believe what it is BETTER FOR US to believe?\nAnd can we then keep the notion of what is better for us, and what\nis true for us, permanently apart?",
        "Pragmatism says no, and I fully agree with her. Probably you also\nagree, so far as the abstract statement goes, but with a suspicion\nthat if we practically did believe everything that made for good in\nour own personal lives, we should be found indulging all kinds of\nfancies about this world’s affairs, and all kinds of sentimental\nsuperstitions about a world hereafter. Your suspicion here is\nundoubtedly well founded, and it is evident that something happens\nwhen you pass from the abstract to the concrete, that complicates\nthe situation.",
        "I said just now that what is better for us to believe is true UNLESS\nTHE BELIEF INCIDENTALLY CLASHES WITH SOME OTHER VITAL BENEFIT. Now\nin real life what vital benefits is any particular belief of ours\nmost liable to clash with? What indeed except the vital benefits\nyielded by OTHER BELIEFS when these prove incompatible with the\nfirst ones? In other words, the greatest enemy of any one of our\ntruths may be the rest of our truths. Truths have once for all this\ndesperate instinct of self-preservation and of desire to extinguish\nwhatever contradicts them. My belief in the Absolute, based on the\ngood it does me, must run the gauntlet of all my other beliefs.\nGrant that it may be true in giving me a moral holiday.\nNevertheless, as I conceive it,–and let me speak now\nconfidentially, as it were, and merely in my own private person,–it\nclashes with other truths of mine whose benefits I hate to give up\non its account. It happens to be associated with a kind of logic of\nwhich I am the enemy, I find that it entangles me in metaphysical\nparadoxes that are inacceptable, etc., etc.. But as I have enough\ntrouble in life already without adding the trouble of carrying these\nintellectual inconsistencies, I personally just give up the\nAbsolute. I just TAKE my moral holidays; or else as a professional\nphilosopher, I try to justify them by some other principle.",
        "If I could restrict my notion of the Absolute to its bare holiday-\ngiving value, it wouldn’t clash with my other truths. But we cannot\neasily thus restrict our hypotheses. They carry supernumerary\nfeatures, and these it is that clash so. My disbelief in the\nAbsolute means then disbelief in those other supernumerary features,\nfor I fully believe in the legitimacy of taking moral holidays.",
        "You see by this what I meant when I called pragmatism a mediator and\nreconciler and said, borrowing the word from Papini, that he\nunstiffens our theories. She has in fact no prejudices whatever, no\nobstructive dogmas, no rigid canons of what shall count as proof.\nShe is completely genial. She will entertain any hypothesis, she\nwill consider any evidence. It follows that in the religious field\nshe is at a great advantage both over positivistic empiricism, with\nits anti-theological bias, and over religious rationalism, with its\nexclusive interest in the remote, the noble, the simple, and the\nabstract in the way of conception.",
        "In short, she widens the field of search for God. Rationalism sticks\nto logic and the empyrean. Empiricism sticks to the external senses.\nPragmatism is willing to take anything, to follow either logic or\nthe senses, and to count the humblest and most personal experiences.\nShe will count mystical experiences if they have practical\nconsequences. She will take a God who lives in the very dirt of\nprivate fact-if that should seem a likely place to find him.",
        "Her only test of probable truth is what works best in the way of\nleading us, what fits every part of life best and combines with the\ncollectivity of experience’s demands, nothing being omitted. If\ntheological ideas should do this, if the notion of God, in\nparticular, should prove to do it, how could pragmatism possibly\ndeny God’s existence? She could see no meaning in treating as ’not\ntrue’ a notion that was pragmatically so successful. What other kind\nof truth could there be, for her, than all this agreement with\nconcrete reality?",
        "In my last lecture I shall return again to the relations of\npragmatism with religion. But you see already how democratic she is.\nHer manners are as various and flexible, her resources as rich and\nendless, and her conclusions as friendly as those of mother nature.",
        "I am now to make the pragmatic method more familiar by giving you\nsome illustrations of its application to particular problems. I will\nbegin with what is driest, and the first thing I shall take will be\nthe problem of Substance. Everyone uses the old distinction between\nsubstance and attribute, enshrined as it is in the very structure of\nhuman language, in the difference between grammatical subject and\npredicate. Here is a bit of blackboard crayon. Its modes,\nattributes, properties, accidents, or affections,–use which term\nyou will,–are whiteness, friability, cylindrical shape,\ninsolubility in water, etc., etc. But the bearer of these attributes\nis so much chalk, which thereupon is called the substance in which\nthey inhere. So the attributes of this desk inhere in the substance\n’wood,’ those of my coat in the substance ’wool,’ and so forth.\nChalk, wood and wool, show again, in spite of their differences,\ncommon properties, and in so far forth they are themselves counted\nas modes of a still more primal substance, matter, the attributes of\nwhich are space occupancy and impenetrability. Similarly our\nthoughts and feelings are affections or properties of our several\nsouls, which are substances, but again not wholly in their own\nright, for they are modes of the still deeper substance ’spirit.’",
        "Now it was very early seen that all we know of the chalk is the\nwhiteness, friability, etc., all WE KNOW of the wood is the\ncombustibility and fibrous structure. A group of attributes is what\neach substance here is known-as, they form its sole cash-value for\nour actual experience. The substance is in every case revealed\nthrough THEM; if we were cut off from THEM we should never suspect\nits existence; and if God should keep sending them to us in an\nunchanged order, miraculously annihilating at a certain moment the\nsubstance that supported them, we never could detect the moment, for\nour experiences themselves would be unaltered. Nominalists\naccordingly adopt the opinion that substance is a spurious idea due\nto our inveterate human trick of turning names into things.\nPhenomena come in groups–the chalk-group, the wood-group, etc.–and\neach group gets its name. The name we then treat as in a way\nsupporting the group of phenomena. The low thermometer to-day, for\ninstance, is supposed to come from something called the ’climate.’\nClimate is really only the name for a certain group of days, but it\nis treated as if it lay BEHIND the day, and in general we place the\nname, as if it were a being, behind the facts it is the name of. But\nthe phenomenal properties of things, nominalists say, surely do not\nreally inhere in names, and if not in names then they do not inhere\nin anything. They ADhere, or COhere, rather, WITH EACH OTHER, and\nthe notion of a substance inaccessible to us, which we think\naccounts for such cohesion by supporting it, as cement might support\npieces of mosaic, must be abandoned. The fact of the bare cohesion\nitself is all that the notion of the substance signifies. Behind\nthat fact is nothing.",
        "Scholasticism has taken the notion of substance from common sense\nand made it very technical and articulate. Few things would seem to\nhave fewer pragmatic consequences for us than substances, cut off as\nwe are from every contact with them. Yet in one case scholasticism\nhas proved the importance of the substance-idea by treating it\npragmatically. I refer to certain disputes about the mystery of the\nEucharist. Substance here would appear to have momentous pragmatic\nvalue. Since the accidents of the wafer don’t change in the Lord’s\nsupper, and yet it has become the very body of Christ, it must be\nthat the change is in the substance solely. The bread-substance must\nhave been withdrawn, and the divine substance substituted\nmiraculously without altering the immediate sensible properties. But\ntho these don’t alter, a tremendous difference has been made, no\nless a one than this, that we who take the sacrament, now feed upon\nthe very substance of divinity. The substance-notion breaks into\nlife, then, with tremendous effect, if once you allow that\nsubstances can separate from their accidents, and exchange these\nlatter.",
        "This is the only pragmatic application of the substance-idea with\nwhich I am acquainted; and it is obvious that it will only be\ntreated seriously by those who already believe in the ’real\npresence’ on independent grounds.",
        "MATERIAL SUBSTANCE was criticized by Berkeley with such telling\neffect that his name has reverberated through all subsequent\nphilosophy. Berkeley’s treatment of the notion of matter is so well\nknown as to need hardly more than a mention. So far from denying the\nexternal world which we know, Berkeley corroborated it. It was the\nscholastic notion of a material substance unapproachable by us,\nBEHIND the external world, deeper and more real than it, and needed\nto support it, which Berkeley maintained to be the most effective of\nall reducers of the external world to unreality. Abolish that\nsubstance, he said, believe that God, whom you can understand and\napproach, sends you the sensible world directly, and you confirm the\nlatter and back it up by his divine authority. Berkeley’s criticism\nof ’matter’ was consequently absolutely pragmatistic. Matter is\nknown as our sensations of colour, figure, hardness and the like.\nThey are the cash-value of the term. The difference matter makes to\nus by truly being is that we then get such sensations; by not being,\nis that we lack them. These sensations then are its sole meaning.\nBerkeley doesn’t deny matter, then; he simply tells us what it\nconsists of. It is a true name for just so much in the way of\nsensations.",
        "Locke, and later Hume, applied a similar pragmatic criticism to the\nnotion of SPIRITUAL SUBSTANCE. I will only mention Locke’s treatment\nof our ’personal identity.’ He immediately reduces this notion to\nits pragmatic value in terms of experience. It means, he says, so\nmuch consciousness,’ namely the fact that at one moment of life we\nremember other moments, and feel them all as parts of one and the\nsame personal history. Rationalism had explained this practical\ncontinuity in our life by the unity of our soul-substance. But Locke\nsays: suppose that God should take away the consciousness, should WE\nbe any the better for having still the soul-principle? Suppose he\nannexed the same consciousness to different souls, | should we, as\nWE realize OURSELVES, be any the worse for that fact? In Locke’s day\nthe soul was chiefly a thing to be rewarded or punished. See how\nLocke, discussing it from this point of view, keeps the question\npragmatic:",
        "Suppose, he says, one to think himself to be the same soul that once\nwas Nestor or Thersites. Can he think their actions his own any more\nthan the actions of any other man that ever existed? But | let him\nonce find himself CONSCIOUS of any of the actions of Nestor, he then\nfinds himself the same person with Nestor. ... In this personal\nidentity is founded all the right and justice of reward and\npunishment. It may be reasonable to think, no one shall be made to\nanswer for what he knows nothing of, but shall receive his doom, his\nconsciousness accusing or excusing. Supposing a man punished now for\nwhat he had done in another life, whereof he could be made to have\nno consciousness at all, what difference is there between that\npunishment and being created miserable?",
        "Our personal identity, then, consists, for Locke, solely in\npragmatically definable particulars. Whether, apart from these\nverifiable facts, it also inheres in a spiritual principle, is a\nmerely curious speculation. Locke, compromiser that he was,\npassively tolerated the belief in a substantial soul behind our\nconsciousness. But his successor Hume, and most empirical\npsychologists after him, have denied the soul, save as the name for\nverifiable cohesions in our inner life. They redescend into the\nstream of experience with it, and cash it into so much small-change\nvalue in the way of ’ideas’ and their peculiar connexions with each\nother. As I said of Berkeley’s matter, the soul is good or ’true’\nfor just SO MUCH, but no more.",
        "The mention of material substance naturally suggests the doctrine of\n’materialism,’ but philosophical materialism is not necessarily knit\nup with belief in ’matter,’ as a metaphysical principle. One may\ndeny matter in that sense, as strongly as Berkeley did, one may be a\nphenomenalist like Huxley, and yet one may still be a materialist in\nthe wider sense, of explaining higher phenomena by lower ones, and\nleaving the destinies of the world at the mercy of its blinder parts\nand forces. It is in this wider sense of the word that materialism\nis opposed to spiritualism or theism. The laws of physical nature\nare what run things, materialism says. The highest productions of\nhuman genius might be ciphered by one who had complete acquaintance\nwith the facts, out of their physiological conditions, regardless\nwhether nature be there only for our minds, as idealists contend, or\nnot. Our minds in any case would have to record the kind of nature\nit is, and write it down as operating through blind laws of physics.\nThis is the complexion of present day materialism, which may better\nbe called naturalism. Over against it stands ’theism,’ or what in a\nwide sense may be termed ’spiritualism.’ Spiritualism says that mind\nnot only witnesses and records things, but also runs and operates\nthem: the world being thus guided, not by its lower, but by its\nhigher element.",
        "Treated as it often is, this question becomes little more than a\nconflict between aesthetic preferences. Matter is gross, coarse,\ncrass, muddy; spirit is pure, elevated, noble; and since it is more\nconsonant with the dignity of the universe to give the primacy in it\nto what appears superior, spirit must be affirmed as the ruling\nprinciple. To treat abstract principles as finalities, before which\nour intellects may come to rest in a state of admiring\ncontemplation, is the great rationalist failing. Spiritualism, as\noften held, may be simply a state of admiration for one kind, and of\ndislike for another kind, of abstraction. I remember a worthy\nspiritualist professor who always referred to materialism as the\n’mud-philosophy,’ and deemed it thereby refuted.",
        "To such spiritualism as this there is an easy answer, and Mr.\nSpencer makes it effectively. In some well-written pages at the end\nof the first volume of his Psychology he shows us that a ’matter’ so\ninfinitely subtile, and performing motions as inconceivably quick\nand fine as those which modern science postulates in her\nexplanations, has no trace of grossness left. He shows that the\nconception of spirit, as we mortals hitherto have framed it, is\nitself too gross to cover the exquisite tenuity of nature’s facts.\nBoth terms, he says, are but symbols, pointing to that one\nunknowable reality in which their oppositions cease.",
        "To an abstract objection an abstract rejoinder suffices; and so far\nas one’s opposition to materialism springs from one’s disdain of\nmatter as something ’crass,’ Mr. Spencer cuts the ground from under\none. Matter is indeed infinitely and incredibly refined. To anyone\nwho has ever looked on the face of a dead child or parent the mere\nfact that matter COULD have taken for a time that precious form,\nought to make matter sacred ever after. It makes no difference what\nthe PRINCIPLE of life may be, material or immaterial, matter at any\nrate co-operates, lends itself to all life’s purposes. That beloved\nincarnation was among matter’s possibilities.",
        "But now, instead of resting in principles after this stagnant\nintellectualist fashion, let us apply the pragmatic method to the\nquestion. What do we MEAN by matter? What practical difference can\nit make NOW that the world should be run by matter or by spirit? I\nthink we find that the problem takes with this a rather different\ncharacter.",
        "And first of all I call your attention to a curious fact. It makes\nnot a single jot of difference so far as the PAST of the world goes,\nwhether we deem it to have been the work of matter or whether we\nthink a divine spirit was its author.",
        "Imagine, in fact, the entire contents of the world to be once for\nall irrevocably given. Imagine it to end this very moment, and to\nhave no future; and then let a theist and a materialist apply their\nrival explanations to its history. The theist shows how a God made\nit; the materialist shows, and we will suppose with equal success,\nhow it resulted from blind physical forces. Then let the pragmatist\nbe asked to choose between their theories. How can he apply his test\nif the world is already completed? Concepts for him are things to\ncome back into experience with, things to make us look for\ndifferences. But by hypothesis there is to be no more experience and\nno possible differences can now be looked for. Both theories have\nshown all their consequences and, by the hypothesis we are adopting,\nthese are identical. The pragmatist must consequently say that the\ntwo theories, in spite of their different-sounding names, mean\nexactly the same thing, and that the dispute is purely verbal. [I am\nopposing, of course, that the theories HAVE been equally successful\nin their explanations of what is.]",
        "For just consider the case sincerely, and say what would be the\nWORTH of a God if he WERE there, with his work accomplished arid his\nworld run down. He would be worth no more than just that world was\nworth. To that amount of result, with its mixed merits and defects,\nhis creative power could attain, but go no farther. And since there\nis to be no future; since the whole value and meaning of the world\nhas been already paid in and actualized in the feelings that went\nwith it in the passing, and now go with it in the ending; since it\ndraws no supplemental significance (such as our real world draws)\nfrom its function of preparing something yet to come; why then, by\nit we take God’s measure, as it were. He is the Being who could once\nfor all do THAT; and for that much we are thankful to him, but for\nnothing more. But now, on the contrary hypothesis, namely, that the\nbits of matter following their laws could make that world and do no\nless, should we not be just as thankful to them? Wherein should we\nsuffer loss, then, if we dropped God as an hypothesis and made the\nmatter alone responsible? Where would any special deadness, or\ncrassness, come in? And how, experience being what is once for all,\nwould God’s presence in it make it any more living or richer?",
        "Candidly, it is impossible to give any answer to this question. The\nactually experienced world is supposed to be the same in its details\non either hypothesis, “the same, for our praise or blame,” as\nBrowning says. It stands there indefeasibly: a gift which can’t be\ntaken back. Calling matter the cause of it retracts no single one of\nthe items that have made it up, nor does calling God the cause\naugment them. They are the God or the atoms, respectively, of just\nthat and no other world. The God, if there, has been doing just what\natoms could do–appearing in the character of atoms, so to speak–\nand earning such gratitude as is due to atoms, and no more. If his\npresence lends no different turn or issue to the performance, it\nsurely can lend it no increase of dignity. Nor would indignity come\nto it were he absent, and did the atoms remain the only actors on\nthe stage. When a play is once over, and the curtain down, you\nreally make it no better by claiming an illustrious genius for its\nauthor, just as you make it no worse by calling him a common hack.",
        "Thus if no future detail of experience or conduct is to be deduced\nfrom our hypothesis, the debate between materialism and theism\nbecomes quite idle and insignificant. Matter and God in that event\nmean exactly the same thing–the power, namely, neither more nor\nless, that could make just this completed world–and the wise man is\nhe who in such a case would turn his back on such a supererogatory\ndiscussion. Accordingly, most men instinctively, and positivists and\nscientists deliberately, do turn their backs on philosophical\ndisputes from which nothing in the line of definite future\nconsequences can be seen to follow. The verbal and empty character\nof philosophy is surely a reproach with which we are, but too\nfamiliar. If pragmatism be true, it is a perfectly sound reproach\nunless the theories under fire can be shown to have alternative\npractical outcomes, however delicate and distant these may be. The\ncommon man and the scientist say they discover no such outcomes, and\nif the metaphysician can discern none either, the others certainly\nare in the right of it, as against him. His science is then but\npompous trifling; and the endowment of a professorship for such a\nbeing would be silly.",
        "Accordingly, in every genuine metaphysical debate some practical\nissue, however conjectural and remote, is involved. To realize this,\nrevert with me to our question, and place yourselves this time in\nthe world we live in, in the world that HAS a future, that is yet\nuncompleted whilst we speak. In this unfinished world the\nalternative of ’materialism or theism?’ is intensely practical; and\nit is worth while for us to spend some minutes of our hour in seeing\nthat it is so.",
        "How, indeed, does the program differ for us, according as we\nconsider that the facts of experience up to date are purposeless\nconfigurations of blind atoms moving according to eternal laws, or\nthat on the other hand they are due to the providence of God? As far\nas the past facts go, indeed there is no difference. Those facts are\nin, are bagged, are captured; and the good that’s in them is gained,\nbe the atoms or be the God their cause. There are accordingly many\nmaterialists about us to-day who, ignoring altogether the future and\npractical aspects of the question, seek to eliminate the odium\nattaching to the word materialism, and even to eliminate the word\nitself, by showing that, if matter could give birth to all these\ngains, why then matter, functionally considered, is just as divine\nan entity as God, in fact coalesces with God, is what you mean by\nGod. Cease, these persons advise us, to use either of these terms,\nwith their outgrown opposition. Use a term free of the clerical\nconnotations, on the one hand; of the suggestion of gross-ness,\ncoarseness, ignobility, on the other. Talk of the primal mystery, of\nthe unknowable energy, of the one and only power, instead of saying\neither God or matter. This is the course to which Mr. Spencer urges\nus; and if philosophy were purely retrospective, he would thereby\nproclaim himself an excellent pragmatist.",
        "But philosophy is prospective also, and, after finding what the\nworld has been and done and yielded, still asks the further question\n’what does the world PROMISE?’ Give us a matter that promises\nSUCCESS, that is bound by its laws to lead our world ever nearer to\nperfection, and any rational man will worship that matter as readily\nas Mr. Spencer worships his own so-called unknowable power. It not\nonly has made for righteousness up to date, but it will make for\nrighteousness forever; and that is all we need. Doing practically\nall that a God can do, it is equivalent to God, its function is a\nGod’s function, and is exerted in a world in which a God would now\nbe superfluous; from such a world a God could never lawfully be\nmissed. ’Cosmic emotion’ would here be the right name for religion.",
        "But is the matter by which Mr. Spencer’s process of cosmic evolution\nis carried on any such principle of never-ending perfection as this?\nIndeed it is not, for the future end of every cosmically evolved\nthing or system of things is foretold by science to be death and\ntragedy; and Mr. Spencer, in confining himself to the aesthetic and\nignoring the practical side of the controversy, has really\ncontributed nothing serious to its relief. But apply now our\nprinciple of practical results, and see what a vital significance\nthe question of materialism or theism immediately acquires.",
        "Theism and materialism, so indifferent when taken retrospectively,\npoint, when we take them prospectively, to wholly different outlooks\nof experience. For, according to the theory of mechanical evolution,\nthe laws of redistribution of matter and motion, tho they are\ncertainly to thank for all the good hours which our organisms have\never yielded us and for all the ideals which our minds now frame,\nare yet fatally certain to undo their work again, and to redissolve\neverything that they have once evolved. You all know the picture of\nthe last state of the universe which evolutionary science foresees.\nI cannot state it better than in Mr. Balfour’s words: “The energies\nof our system will decay, the glory of the sun will be dimmed, and\nthe earth, tideless and inert, will no longer tolerate the race\nwhich has for a moment disturbed its solitude. Man will go down into\nthe pit, and all his thoughts will perish. The uneasy, consciousness\nwhich in this obscure corner has for a brief space broken the\ncontented silence of the universe, will be at rest. Matter will know\nitself no longer. ’Imperishable monuments’ and ’immortal deeds,’\ndeath itself, and love stronger than death, will be as though they\nhad never been. Nor will anything that is, be better or be worse for\nall that the labour, genius, devotion, and suffering of man have\nstriven through countless generations to effect.” [Footnote: The\nFoundations of Belief, p. 30.]",
        "That is the sting of it, that in the vast driftings of the cosmic\nweather, tho many a jeweled shore appears, and many an enchanted\ncloud-bank floats away, long lingering ere it be dissolved–even as\nour world now lingers, for our joy-yet when these transient products\nare gone, nothing, absolutely NOTHING remains, of represent those\nparticular qualities, those elements of preciousness which they may\nhave enshrined. Dead and gone are they, gone utterly from the very\nsphere and room of being. Without an echo; without a memory; without\nan influence on aught that may come after, to make it care for\nsimilar ideals. This utter final wreck and tragedy is of the essence\nof scientific materialism as at present understood. The lower and\nnot the higher forces are the eternal forces, or the last surviving\nforces within the only cycle of evolution which we can definitely\nsee. Mr. Spencer believes this as much as anyone; so why should he\nargue with us as if we were making silly aesthetic objections to the\n’grossness’ of ’matter and motion,’ the principles of his\nphilosophy, when what really dismays us is the disconsolateness of\nits ulterior practical results?",
        "No the true objection to materialism is not positive but negative.\nIt would be farcical at this day to make complaint of it for what it\nIS for ’grossness.’ Grossness is what grossness DOES–we now know\nTHAT. We make complaint of it, on the contrary, for what it is NOT–\nnot a permanent warrant for our more ideal interests, not a\nfulfiller of our remotest hopes.",
        "The notion of God, on the other hand, however inferior it may be in\nclearness to those mathematical notions so current in mechanical\nphilosophy, has at least this practical superiority over them, that\nit guarantees an ideal order that shall be permanently preserved. A\nworld with a God in it to say the last word, may indeed burn up or\nfreeze, but we then think of him as still mindful of the old ideals\nand sure to bring them elsewhere to fruition; so that, where he is,\ntragedy is only provisional and partial, and shipwreck and\ndissolution not the absolutely final things. This need of an eternal\nmoral order is one of the deepest needs of our breast. And those\npoets, like Dante and Wordsworth, who live on the conviction of such\nan order, owe to that fact the extraordinary tonic and consoling\npower of their verse. Here then, in these different emotional and\npractical appeals, in these adjustments of our concrete attitudes of\nhope and expectation, and all the delicate consequences which their\ndifferences entail, lie the real meanings of materialism and\nspiritualism–not in hair-splitting abstractions about matter’s\ninner essence, or about the metaphysical attributes of God.\nMaterialism means simply the denial that the moral order is eternal,\nand the cutting off of ultimate hopes; spiritualism means the\naffirmation of an eternal moral order and the letting loose of hope.\nSurely here is an issue genuine enough, for anyone who feels it;\nand, as long as men are men, it will yield matter for a serious\nphilosophic debate.",
        "But possibly some of you may still rally to their defence. Even\nwhilst admitting that spiritualism and materialism make different\nprophecies of the world’s future, you may yourselves pooh-pooh the\ndifference as something so infinitely remote as to mean nothing for\na sane mind. The essence of a sane mind, you may say, is to take\nshorter views, and to feel no concern about such chimaeras as the\nlatter end of the world. Well, I can only say that if you say this,\nyou do injustice to human nature. Religious melancholy is not\ndisposed of by a simple flourish of the word insanity. The absolute\nthings, the last things, the overlapping things, are the truly\nphilosophic concerns; all superior minds feel seriously about them,\nand the mind with the shortest views is simply the mind of the more\nshallow man.",
        "The issues of fact at stake in the debate are of course vaguely\nenough conceived by us at present. But spiritualistic faith in all\nits forms deals with a world of PROMISE, while materialism’s sun\nsets in a sea of disappointment. Remember what I said of the\nAbsolute: it grants us moral holidays. Any religious view does this.\nIt not only incites our more strenuous moments, but it also takes\nour joyous, careless, trustful moments, and it justifies them. It\npaints the grounds of justification vaguely enough, to be sure. The\nexact features of the saving future facts that our belief in God\ninsures, will have to be ciphered out by the interminable methods of\nscience: we can STUDY our God only by studying his Creation. But we\ncan ENJOY our God, if we have one, in advance of all that labor. I\nmyself believe that the evidence for God lies primarily in inner\npersonal experiences. When they have once given you your God, his\nname means at least the benefit of the holiday. You remember what I\nsaid yesterday about the way in which truths clash and try to ’down’\neach other. The truth of ’God’ has to run the gauntlet of all our\nother truths. It is on trial by them and they on trial by it. Our\nFINAL opinion about God can be settled only after all the truths\nhave straightened themselves out together. Let us hope that they\nshall find a modus vivendi!",
        "Let me pass to a very cognate philosophic problem, the QUESTION of\nDESIGN IN NATURE. God’s existence has from time immemorial been held\nto be proved by certain natural facts. Many facts appear as if\nexpressly designed in view of one another. Thus the woodpecker’s\nbill, tongue, feet, tail, etc., fit him wondrously for a world of\ntrees with grubs hid in their bark to feed upon. The parts of our\neye fit the laws of light to perfection, leading its rays to a sharp\npicture on our retina. Such mutual fitting of things diverse in\norigin argued design, it was held; and the designer was always\ntreated as a man-loving deity.",
        "The first step in these arguments was to prove that the design\nexisted. Nature was ransacked for results obtained through separate\nthings being co-adapted. Our eyes, for instance, originate in intra-\nuterine darkness, and the light originates in the sun, yet see how\nthey fit each other. They are evidently made FOR each other. Vision\nis the end designed, light and eyes the separate means devised for\nits attainment.",
        "It is strange, considering how unanimously our ancestors felt the\nforce of this argument, to see how little it counts for since the\ntriumph of the darwinian theory. Darwin opened our minds to the\npower of chance-happenings to bring forth ’fit’ results if only they\nhave time to add themselves together. He showed the enormous waste\nof nature in producing results that get destroyed because of their\nunfitness. He also emphasized the number of adaptations which, if\ndesigned, would argue an evil rather than a good designer. Here all\ndepends upon the point of view. To the grub under the bark the\nexquisite fitness of the woodpecker’s organism to extract him would\ncertainly argue a diabolical designer.",
        "Theologians have by this time stretched their minds so as to embrace\nthe darwinian facts, and yet to interpret them as still showing\ndivine purpose. It used to be a question of purpose AGAINST\nmechanism, of one OR the other. It was as if one should say “My\nshoes are evidently designed to fit my feet, hence it is impossible\nthat they should have been produced by machinery.” We know that they\nare both: they are made by a machinery itself designed to fit the\nfeet with shoes. Theology need only stretch similarly the designs of\nGod. As the aim of a football-team is not merely to get the ball to\na certain goal (if that were so, they would simply get up on some\ndark night and place it there), but to get it there by a fixed\nMACHINERY OF CONDITIONS–the game’s rules and the opposing players;\nso the aim of God is not merely, let us say, to make men and to save\nthem, but rather to get this done through the sole agency of\nnature’s vast machinery. Without nature’s stupendous laws and\ncounterforces, man’s creation and perfection, we might suppose,\nwould be too insipid achievements for God to have designed them.",
        "This saves the form of the design-argument at the expense of its old\neasy human content. The designer is no longer the old man-like\ndeity. His designs have grown so vast as to be incomprehensible to\nus humans. The WHAT of them so overwhelms us that to establish the\nmere THAT of a designer for them becomes of very little consequence\nin comparison. We can with difficulty comprehend the character of a\ncosmic mind whose purposes are fully revealed by the strange mixture\nof goods and evils that we find in this actual world’s particulars.\nOr rather we cannot by any possibility comprehend it. The mere word\n’design’ by itself has, we see, no consequences and explains\nnothing. It is the barrenest of principles. The old question of\nWHETHER there is design is idle. The real question is WHAT is the\nworld, whether or not it have a designer–and that can be revealed\nonly by the study of all nature’s particulars.",
        "Remember that no matter what nature may have produced or may be\nproducing, the means must necessarily have been adequate, must have\nbeen FITTED TO THAT PRODUCTION. The argument from fitness to design\nwould consequently always apply, whatever were the product’s\ncharacter. The recent Mont-Pelee eruption, for example, required all\nprevious history to produce that exact combination of ruined houses,\nhuman and animal corpses, sunken ships, volcanic ashes, etc., in\njust that one hideous configuration of positions. France had to be a\nnation and colonize Martinique. Our country had to exist and send\nour ships there. IF God aimed at just that result, the means by\nwhich the centuries bent their influences towards it, showed\nexquisite intelligence. And so of any state of things whatever,\neither in nature or in history, which we find actually realized. For\nthe parts of things must always make SOME definite resultant, be it\nchaotic or harmonious. When we look at what has actually come, the\nconditions must always appear perfectly designed to ensure it. We\ncan always say, therefore, in any conceivable world, of any\nconceivable character, that the whole cosmic machinery MAY have been\ndesigned to produce it.",
        "Pragmatically, then, the abstract word ’design’ is a blank\ncartridge. It carries no consequences, it does no execution. What\nsort of design? and what sort of a designer? are the only serious\nquestions, and the study of facts is the only way of getting even\napproximate answers. Meanwhile, pending the slow answer from facts,\nanyone who insists that there is a designer and who is sure he is a\ndivine one, gets a certain pragmatic benefit from the term–the\nsame, in fact which we saw that the terms God, Spirit, or the\nAbsolute, yield us ’Design,’ worthless tho it be as a mere\nrationalistic principle set above or behind things for our\nadmiration, becomes, if our faith concretes it into something\ntheistic, a term of PROMISE. Returning with it into experience, we\ngain a more confiding outlook on the future. If not a blind force\nbut a seeing force runs things, we may reasonably expect better\nissues. This vague confidence in the future is the sole pragmatic\nmeaning at present discernible in the terms design and designer. But\nif cosmic confidence is right not wrong, better not worse, that is a\nmost important meaning. That much at least of possible ’truth’ the\nterms will then have in them.",
        "Let me take up another well-worn controversy, THE FREE-WILL PROBLEM.\nMost persons who believe in what is called their free-will do so\nafter the rationalistic fashion. It is a principle, a positive\nfaculty or virtue added to man, by which his dignity is\nenigmatically augmented. He ought to believe it for this reason.\nDeterminists, who deny it, who say that individual men originate\nnothing, but merely transmit to the future the whole push of the\npast cosmos of which they are so small an expression, diminish man.\nHe is less admirable, stripped of this creative principle. I imagine\nthat more than half of you share our instinctive belief in free-\nwill, and that admiration of it as a principle of dignity has much\nto do with your fidelity.",
        "But free-will has also been discussed pragmatically, and, strangely\nenough, the same pragmatic interpretation has been put upon it by\nboth disputants. You know how large a part questions of\nACCOUNTABILITY have played in ethical controversy. To hear some\npersons, one would suppose that all that ethics aims at is a code of\nmerits and demerits. Thus does the old legal and theological leaven,\nthe interest in crime and sin and punishment abide with us. ’Who’s\nto blame? whom can we punish? whom will God punish?’–these\npreoccupations hang like a bad dream over man’s religious history.",
        "So both free-will and determinism have been inveighed against and\ncalled absurd, because each, in the eyes of its enemies, has seemed\nto prevent the ’imputability’ of good or bad deeds to their authors.\nQueer antinomy this! Free-will means novelty, the grafting on to the\npast of something not involved therein. If our acts were\npredetermined, if we merely transmitted the push of the whole past,\nthe free-willists say, how could we be praised or blamed for\nanything? We should be ’agents’ only, not ’principals,’ and where\nthen would be our precious imputability and responsibility?",
        "But where would it be if we HAD free-will? rejoin the determinists.\nIf a ’free’ act be a sheer novelty, that comes not FROM me, the\nprevious me, but ex nihilo, and simply tacks itself on to me, how\ncan I, the previous I, be responsible? How can I have any\npermanent CHARACTER that will stand still long enough for praise or\nblame to be awarded? The chaplet of my days tumbles into a cast of\ndisconnected beads as soon as the thread of inner necessity is drawn\nout by the preposterous indeterminist doctrine. Messrs. Fullerton\nand McTaggart have recently laid about them doughtily with this\nargument.",
        "It may be good ad hominem, but otherwise it is pitiful. For I ask\nyou, quite apart from other reasons, whether any man, woman or\nchild, with a sense for realities, ought not to be ashamed to plead\nsuch principles as either dignity or imputability. Instinct and\nutility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social\nbusiness of punishment and praise. If a man does good acts we shall\npraise him, if he does bad acts we shall punish him–anyhow, and\nquite apart from theories as to whether the acts result from what\nwas previous in him or are novelties in a strict sense. To make our\nhuman ethics revolve about the question of ’merit’ is a piteous\nunreality–God alone can know our merits, if we have any. The real\nground for supposing free-will is indeed pragmatic, but it has\nnothing to do with this contemptible right to punish which had made\nsuch a noise in past discussions of the subject.",
        "Free-will pragmatically means NOVELTIES IN THE WORLD, the right to\nexpect that in its deepest elements as well as in its surface\nphenomena, the future may not identically repeat and imitate the\npast. That imitation en masse is there, who can deny? The general\n’uniformity of nature’ is presupposed by every lesser law. But\nnature may be only approximately uniform; and persons in whom\nknowledge of the world’s past has bred pessimism (or doubts as to\nthe world’s good character, which become certainties if that\ncharacter be supposed eternally fixed) may naturally welcome free-\nwill as a MELIORISTIC doctrine. It holds up improvement as at least\npossible; whereas determinism assures us that our whole notion of\npossibility is born of human ignorance, and that necessity and\nimpossibility between them rule the destinies of the world.",
        "Free-will is thus a general cosmological theory of PROMISE, just\nlike the Absolute, God, Spirit or Design. Taken abstractly, no one\nof these terms has any inner content, none of them gives us any\npicture, and no one of them would retain the least pragmatic value\nin a world whose character was obviously perfect from the start.\nElation at mere existence, pure cosmic emotion and delight, would,\nit seems to me, quench all interest in those speculations, if the\nworld were nothing but a lubberland of happiness already. Our\ninterest in religious metaphysics arises in the fact that our\nempirical future feels to us unsafe, and needs some higher\nguarantee. If the past and present were purely good, who could wish\nthat the future might possibly not resemble them? Who could desire\nfree-will? Who would not say, with Huxley, “let me be wound up every\nday like a watch, to go right fatally, and I ask no better freedom.\"\n’Freedom’ in a world already perfect could only mean freedom to BE\nWORSE, and who could be so insane as to wish that? To be necessarily\nwhat it is, to be impossibly aught else, would put the last touch of\nperfection upon optimism’s universe. Surely the only POSSIBILITY\nthat one can rationally claim is the possibility that things may be\nBETTER. That possibility, I need hardly say, is one that, as the\nactual world goes, we have ample grounds for desiderating.",
        "Free-will thus has no meaning unless it be a doctrine of RELIEF. As\nsuch, it takes its place with other religious doctrines. Between\nthem, they build up the old wastes and repair the former\ndesolations. Our spirit, shut within this courtyard of sense-\nexperience, is always saying to the intellect upon the tower:\n’Watchman, tell us of the night, if it aught of promise bear,’ and\nthe intellect gives it then these terms of promise.",
        "Other than this practical significance, the words God, free-will,\ndesign, etc., have none. Yet dark tho they be in themselves, or\nintellectualistically taken, when we bear them into life’s thicket\nwith us the darkness THERE grows light about us. If you stop, in\ndealing with such words, with their definition, thinking that to be\nan intellectual finality, where are you? Stupidly staring at a\npretentious sham! “Deus est Ens, a se, extra et supra omne genus,\nnecessarium, unum, infinite perfectum, simplex, immutabile,\nimmensum, aeternum, intelligens,” etc.,–wherein is such a\ndefinition really instructive? It means less, than nothing, in its\npompous robe of adjectives. Pragmatism alone can read a positive\nmeaning into it, and for that she turns her back upon the\nintellectualist point of view altogether. ’God’s in his heaven;\nall’s right with the world!’–THAT’S the heart of your theology, and\nfor that you need no rationalist definitions.",
        "Why shouldn’t we all of us, rationalists as well as pragmatists,\nconfess this? Pragmatism, so far from keeping her eyes bent on the\nimmediate practical foreground, as she is accused of doing, dwells\njust as much upon the world’s remotest perspectives.",
        "See then how all these ultimate questions turn, as it were, up their\nhinges; and from looking backwards upon principles, upon an\nerkenntnisstheoretische Ich, a God, a Kausalitaetsprinzip, a Design,\na Free-will, taken in themselves, as something august and exalted\nabove facts,–see, I say, how pragmatism shifts the emphasis and\nlooks forward into facts themselves. The really vital question for\nus all is, What is this world going to be? What is life eventually\nto make of itself? The centre of gravity of philosophy must\ntherefore alter its place. The earth of things, long thrown into\nshadow by the glories of the upper ether, must resume its rights. To\nshift the emphasis in this way means that philosophic questions will\nfall to be treated by minds of a less abstractionist type than\nheretofore, minds more scientific and individualistic in their tone\nyet not irreligious either. It will be an alteration in ’the seat of\nauthority’ that reminds one almost of the protestant reformation.\nAnd as, to papal minds, protestantism has often seemed a mere mess\nof anarchy and confusion, such, no doubt, will pragmatism often seem\nto ultra-rationalist minds in philosophy. It will seem so much sheer\ntrash, philosophically. But life wags on, all the same, and\ncompasses its ends, in protestant countries. I venture to think that\nphilosophic protestantism will compass a not dissimilar prosperity.",
        "We saw in the last lecture that the pragmatic method, in its\ndealings with certain concepts, instead of ending with admiring\ncontemplation, plunges forward into the river of experience with\nthem and prolongs the perspective by their means. Design, free-will,\nthe absolute mind, spirit instead of matter, have for their sole\nmeaning a better promise as to this world’s outcome. Be they false\nor be they true, the meaning of them is this meliorism. I have\nsometimes thought of the phenomenon called ’total reflexion’ in\noptics as a good symbol of the relation between abstract ideas and\nconcrete realities, as pragmatism conceives it. Hold a tumbler of\nwater a little above your eyes and look up through the water at its\nsurface–or better still look similarly through the flat wall of an\naquarium. You will then see an extraordinarily brilliant reflected\nimage say of a candle-flame, or any other clear object, situated on\nthe opposite side of the vessel. No candle-ray, under these\ncircumstances gets beyond the water’s surface: every ray is totally\nreflected back into the depths again. Now let the water represent\nthe world of sensible facts, and let the air above it represent the\nworld of abstract ideas. Both worlds are real, of course, and\ninteract; but they interact only at their boundary, and the locus of\neverything that lives, and happens to us, so far as full experience\ngoes, is the water. We are like fishes swimming in the sea of sense,\nbounded above by the superior element, but unable to breathe it pure\nor penetrate it. We get our oxygen from it, however, we touch it\nincessantly, now in this part, now in that, and every time we touch\nit we are reflected back into the water with our course re-\ndetermined and re-energized. The abstract ideas of which the air\nconsists, indispensable for life, but irrespirable by themselves, as\nit were, and only active in their re-directing function. All similes\nare halting but this one rather takes my fancy. It shows how\nsomething, not sufficient for life in itself, may nevertheless be an\neffective determinant of life elsewhere.",
        "In this present hour I wish to illustrate the pragmatic method by\none more application. I wish to turn its light upon the ancient\nproblem of ’the one and the many.’ I suspect that in but few of you\nhas this problem occasioned sleepless nights, and I should not be\nastonished if some of you told me it had never vexed you. I myself\nhave come, by long brooding over it, to consider it the most central\nof all philosophic problems, central because so pregnant. I mean by\nthis that if you know whether a man is a decided monist or a decided\npluralist, you perhaps know more about the rest of his opinions than\nif you give him any other name ending in IST. To believe in the one\nor in the many, that is the classification with the maximum number\nof consequences. So bear with me for an hour while I try to inspire\nyou with my own interest in the problem.",
        "Philosophy has often been defined as the quest or the vision of the\nworld’s unity. We never hear this definition challenged, and it is\ntrue as far as it goes, for philosophy has indeed manifested above\nall things its interest in unity. But how about the VARIETY in\nthings? Is that such an irrelevant matter? If instead of using the\nterm philosophy, we talk in general of our intellect and its needs\nwe quickly see that unity is only one of these. Acquaintance with\nthe details of fact is always reckoned, along with their reduction\nto system, as an indispensable mark of mental greatness. Your\n’scholarly’ mind, of encyclopedic, philological type, your man\nessentially of learning, has never lacked for praise along with your\nphilosopher. What our intellect really aims at is neither variety\nnor unity taken singly but totality.[Footnote: Compare  A.\nBellanger: Les concepts de Cause, et l’activite intentionelle de\nl’Esprit. Paris, Alcan, 1905, p. 79 ff.] In this, acquaintance with\nreality’s diversities is as important as understanding their\nconnexion. The human passion of curiosity runs on all fours with the\nsystematizing passion.",
        "In spite of this obvious fact the unity of things has always been\nconsidered more illustrious, as it were, than their variety. When a\nyoung man first conceives the notion that the whole world forms one\ngreat fact, with all its parts moving abreast, as it were, and\ninterlocked, he feels as if he were enjoying a great insight, and\nlooks superciliously on all who still fall short of this sublime\nconception. Taken thus abstractly as it first comes to one, the\nmonistic insight is so vague as hardly to seem worth defending\nintellectually. Yet probably everyone in this audience in some way\ncherishes it. A certain abstract monism, a certain emotional\nresponse to the character of oneness, as if it were a feature of the\nworld not coordinate with its manyness, but vastly more excellent\nand eminent, is so prevalent in educated circles that we might\nalmost call it a part of philosophic common sense. Of COURSE the\nworld is one, we say. How else could it be a world at all?\nEmpiricists as a rule, are as stout monists of this abstract kind as\nrationalists are.",
        "The difference is that the empiricists are less dazzled. Unity\ndoesn’t blind them to everything else, doesn’t quench their\ncuriosity for special facts, whereas there is a kind of rationalist\nwho is sure to interpret abstract unity mystically and to forget\neverything else, to treat it as a principle; to admire and worship\nit; and thereupon to come to a full stop intellectually.",
        "’The world is One!’–the formula may become a sort of number-\nworship. ’Three’ and ’seven’ have, it is true, been reckoned sacred\nnumbers; but, abstractly taken, why is ’one’ more excellent than\n’forty-three,’ or than ’two million and ten’? In this first vague\nconviction of the world’s unity, there is so little to take hold of\nthat we hardly know what we mean by it.",
        "The only way to get forward with our notion is to treat it\npragmatically. Granting the oneness to exist, what facts will be\ndifferent in consequence? What will the unity be known-as? The world\nis one–yes, but HOW one? What is the practical value of the oneness\nfor US?",
        "Asking such questions, we pass from the vague to the definite, from\nthe abstract to the concrete. Many distinct ways in which oneness\npredicated of the universe might make a difference, come to view. I\nwill note successively the more obvious of these ways.",
        "1. First, the world is at least ONE SUBJECT OF DISCOURSE. If its\nmanyness were so irremediable as to permit NO union whatever of it\nparts, not even our minds could ’mean’ the whole of it at once: the\nwould be like eyes trying to look in opposite directions. But in\npoint of fact we mean to cover the whole of it by our abstract term\n’world’ or ’universe,’ which expressly intends that no part shall be\nleft out. Such unity of discourse carries obviously no farther\nmonistic specifications. A ’chaos,’ once so named, has as much unity\nof discourse as a cosmos. It is an odd fact that many monists\nconsider a great victory scored for their side when pluralists say\n’the universe is many.’ “’The universe’!” they chuckle–\"his speech\nbewrayeth him. He stands confessed of monism out of his own mouth.\"\nWell, let things be one in that sense! You can then fling such a\nword as universe at the whole collection of them, but what matters\nit? It still remains to be ascertained whether they are one in any\nother sense that is more valuable.",
        "2. Are they, for example, CONTINUOUS? Can you pass from one to\nanother, keeping always in your one universe without any danger of\nfalling out? In other words, do the parts of our universe HANG\ntogether, instead of being like detached grains of sand?",
        "Even grains of sand hang together through the space in which they\nare embedded, and if you can in any way move through such space, you\ncan pass continuously from number one of them to number two. Space\nand time are thus vehicles of continuity, by which the world’s parts\nhang together. The practical difference to us, resultant from these\nforms of union, is immense. Our whole motor life is based upon\nthem.",
        "3. There are innumerable other paths of practical continuity among\nthings. Lines of INFLUENCE can be traced by which they together.\nFollowing any such line you pass from one thing to another till you\nmay have covered a good part of the universe’s extent. Gravity and\nheat-conduction are such all-uniting influences, so far as the\nphysical world goes. Electric, luminous and chemical influences\nfollow similar lines of influence. But opaque and inert bodies\ninterrupt the continuity here, so that you have to step round them,\nor change your mode of progress if you wish to get farther on that\nday. Practically, you have then lost your universe’s unity, SO FAR\nAS IT WAS CONSTITUTED BY THOSE FIRST LINES OF INFLUENCE. There are\ninnumerable kinds of connexion that special things have with other\nspecial things; and the ENSEMBLE of any one of these connexions\nforms one sort of system by which things are conjoined. Thus men are\nconjoined in a vast network of ACQUAINTANCESHIP. Brown knows Jones,\nJones knows Robinson, etc.; and BY CHOOSING YOUR FARTHER\nINTERMEDIARIES RIGHTLY you may carry a message from Jones to the\nEmpress of China, or the Chief of the African Pigmies, or to anyone\nelse in the inhabited world. But you are stopped short, as by a non-\nconductor, when you choose one man wrong in this experiment. What\nmay be called love-systems are grafted on the acquaintance-system. A\nloves (or hates) B; B loves (or hates) C, etc. But these systems are\nsmaller than the great acquaintance-system that they presuppose.",
        "Human efforts are daily unifying the world more and more in definite\nsystematic ways. We found colonial, postal, consular, commercial\nsystems, all the parts of which obey definite influences that\npropagate themselves within the system but not to facts outside of\nit. The result is innumerable little hangings-together of the\nworld’s parts within the larger hangings-together, little worlds,\nnot only of discourse but of operation, within the wider universe.\nEach system exemplifies one type or grade of union, its parts being\nstrung on that peculiar kind of relation, and the same part may\nfigure in many different systems, as a man may hold several offices\nand belong to various clubs. From this ’systematic’ point of view,\ntherefore, the pragmatic value of the world’s unity is that all\nthese definite networks actually and practically exist. Some are\nmore enveloping and extensive, some less so; they are superposed\nupon each other; and between them all they let no individual\nelementary part of the universe escape. Enormous as is the amount of\ndisconnexion among things (for these systematic influences and\nconjunctions follow rigidly exclusive paths), everything that exists\nis influenced in SOME way by something else, if you can only pick\nthe way out rightly Loosely speaking, and in general, it may be said\nthat all things cohere and adhere to each other SOMEHOW, and that\nthe universe exists practically in reticulated or concatenated forms\nwhich make of it a continuous or ’integrated’ affair. Any kind of\ninfluence whatever helps to make the world one, so far as you can\nfollow it from next to next. You may then say that ’the world IS\nOne’–meaning in these respects, namely, and just so far as they\nobtain. But just as definitely is it NOT one, so far as they do not\nobtain; and there is no species of connexion which will not fail,\nif, instead of choosing conductors for it, you choose non-\nconductors. You are then arrested at your very first step and have\nto write the world down as a pure MANY from that particular point of\nview. If our intellect had been as much interested in disjunctive as\nit is in conjunctive relations, philosophy would have equally\nsuccessfully celebrated the world’s DISUNION.",
        "The great point is to notice that the oneness and the manyness are\nabsolutely co-ordinate here. Neither is primordial or more essential\nor excellent than the other. Just as with space, whose separating of\nthings seems exactly on a par with its uniting of them, but\nsometimes one function and sometimes the other is what come home to\nus most, so, in our general dealings with the world of influences,\nwe now need conductors and now need non-conductors, and wisdom lies\nin knowing which is which at the appropriate moment.",
        "4. All these systems of influence or non-influence may be listed\nunder the general problem of the world’s CAUSAL UNITY. If the minor\ncausal influences among things should converge towards one common\ncausal origin of them in the past, one great first cause for all\nthat is, one might then speak of the absolute causal unity of the\nworld. God’s fiat on creation’s day has figured in traditional\nphilosophy as such an absolute cause and origin. Transcendental\nIdealism, translating ’creation’ into ’thinking’ (or ’willing to’\nthink’) calls the divine act ’eternal’ rather than ’first’; but the\nunion of the many here is absolute, just the same–the many would\nnot BE, save for the One. Against this notion of the unity of origin\nof all there has always stood the pluralistic notion of an eternal\nself-existing many in the shape of atoms or even of spiritual units\nof some sort. The alternative has doubtless a pragmatic meaning, but\nperhaps, as far as these lectures go, we had better leave the\nquestion of unity of origin unsettled.",
        "5. The most important sort of union that obtains among things,\npragmatically speaking, is their GENERIC UNITY. Things exist in\nkinds, there are many specimens in each kind, and what the ’kind’\nimplies for one specimen, it implies also for every other specimen\nof that kind. We can easily conceive that every fact in the world\nmight be singular, that is, unlike any other fact and sole of its\nkind. In such a world of singulars our logic would be useless, for\nlogic works by predicating of the single instance what is true of\nall its kind. With no two things alike in the world, we should be\nunable to reason from our past experiences to our future ones. The\nexistence of so much generic unity in things is thus perhaps the\nmost momentous pragmatic specification of what it may mean to say\n’the world is One.’ ABSOLUTE generic unity would obtain if there\nwere one summum genus under which all things without exception could\nbe eventually subsumed. ’Beings,’ ’thinkables,’ ’experiences,’ would\nbe candidates for this position. Whether the alternatives expressed\nby such words have any pragmatic significance or not, is another\nquestion which I prefer to leave unsettled just now.",
        "6. Another specification of what the phrase ’the world is One’ may\nmean is UNITY OF PURPOSE. An enormous number of things in the world\nsubserve a common purpose. All the man-made systems, administrative,\nindustrial, military, or what not, exist each for its controlling\npurpose. Every living being pursues its own peculiar purposes. They\nco-operate, according to the degree of their development, in\ncollective or tribal purposes, larger ends thus enveloping lesser\nones, until an absolutely single, final and climacteric purpose\nsubserved by all things without exception might conceivably be\nreached. It is needless to say that the appearances conflict with\nsuch a view. Any resultant, as I said in my third lecture, MAY have\nbeen purposed in advance, but none of the results we actually know\nin is world have in point of fact been purposed in advance in all\ntheir details. Men and nations start with a vague notion of being\nrich, or great, or good. Each step they make brings unforeseen\nchances into sight, and shuts out older vistas, and the\nspecifications of the general purpose have to be daily changed. What\nis reached in the end may be better or worse than what was proposed,\nbut it is always more complex and different.",
        "Our different purposes also are at war with each other. Where one\ncan’t crush the other out, they compromise; and the result is again\ndifferent from what anyone distinctly proposed beforehand. Vaguely\nand generally, much of what was purposed may be gained; but\neverything makes strongly for the view that our world is\nincompletely unified teleologically and is still trying to get its\nunification better organized.",
        "Whoever claims ABSOLUTE teleological unity, saying that there is one\npurpose that every detail of the universe subserves, dogmatizes at\nhis own risk. Theologians who dogmalize thus find it more and more\nimpossible, as our acquaintance with the warring interests of the\nworld’s parts grows more concrete, to imagine what the one\nclimacteric purpose may possibly be like. We see indeed that certain\nevils minister to ulterior goods, that the bitter makes the cocktail\nbetter, and that a bit of danger or hardship puts us agreeably to\nour trumps. We can vaguely generalize this into the doctrine that\nall the evil in the universe is but instrumental to its greater\nperfection. But the scale of the evil actually in sight defies all\nhuman tolerance; and transcendental idealism, in the pages of a\nBradley or a Royce, brings us no farther than the book of Job did–\nGod’s ways are not our ways, so let us put our hands upon our mouth.\nA God who can relish such superfluities of horror is no God for\nhuman beings to appeal to. His animal spirits are too high. In other\nwords the ’Absolute’ with his one purpose, is not the man-like God\nof common people.",
        "7. AESTHETIC UNION among things also obtains, and is very analogous\nto ideological union. Things tell a story. Their parts hang together\nso as to work out a climax. They play into each other’s hands\nexpressively. Retrospectively, we can see that altho no definite\npurpose presided over a chain of events, yet the events fell into a\ndramatic form, with a start, a middle, and a finish. In point of\nfact all stories end; and here again the point of view of a many is\nthat more natural one to take. The world is full of partial stories\nthat run parallel to one another, beginning and ending at odd times.\nThey mutually interlace and interfere at points, but we cannot unify\nthem completely in our minds. In following your life-history, I must\ntemporarily turn my attention from my own. Even a biographer of\ntwins would have to press them alternately upon his reader’s\nattention.",
        "It follows that whoever says that the whole world tells one story\nutters another of those monistic dogmas that a man believes at his\nrisk. It is easy to see the world’s history pluralistically, as a\nrope of which each fibre tells a separate tale; but to conceive of\neach cross-section of the rope as an absolutely single fact, and to\nsum the whole longitudinal series into one being living an undivided\nlife, is harder. We have indeed the analogy of embryology to help\nus. The microscopist makes a hundred flat cross-sections of a given\nembryo, and mentally unites them into one solid whole. But the great\nworld’s ingredients, so far as they are beings, seem, like the\nrope’s fibres, to be discontinuous cross-wise, and to cohere only in\nthe longitudinal direction. Followed in that direction they are\nmany. Even the embryologist, when he follows the DEVELOPMENT of his\nobject, has to treat the history of each single organ in turn.\nABSOLUTE aesthetic union is thus another barely abstract ideal. The\nworld appears as something more epic than dramatic.",
        "So far, then, we see how the world is unified by its many systems,\nkinds, purposes, and dramas. That there is more union in all these\nways than openly appears is certainly true. That there MAY be one\nsovereign purpose, system, kind, and story, is a legitimate\nhypothesis. All I say here is that it is rash to affirm this\ndogmatically without better evidence than we possess at present.",
        "8. The GREAT monistic DENKMITTEL for a hundred years past has been\nthe notion of THE ONE KNOWER. The many exist only as objects for his\nthought–exist in his dream, as it were; and AS HE KNOWS them, they\nhave one purpose, form one system, tell one tale for him. This\nnotion of an ALL-ENVELOPING NOETIC UNITY in things is the sublimest\nachievement of intellectualist philosophy. Those who believe in the\nAbsolute, as the all-knower is termed, usually say that they do so\nfor coercive reasons, which clear thinkers cannot evade. The\nAbsolute has far-reaching practical consequences, some of which I\ndrew attention in my second lecture. Many kinds of difference\nimportant to us would surely follow from its being true. I cannot\nhere enter into all the logical proofs of such a Being’s existence,\nfarther than to say that none of them seem to me sound. I must\ntherefore treat the notion of an All-Knower simply as an hypothesis,\nexactly on a par logically with the pluralist notion that there is\nno point of view, no focus of information extant, from which the\nentire content of the universe is visible at once. “God’s\nconsciousness,” says Professor Royce,[Footnote: The Conception of\nGod, New York, 1897, p. 292.] “forms in its wholeness one luminously\ntransparent conscious moment\"–this is the type of noetic unity on\nwhich rationalism insists. Empiricism on the other hand is satisfied\nwith the type of noetic unity that is humanly familiar. Everything\ngets known by SOME knower along with something else; but the knowers\nmay in the end be irreducibly many, and the greatest knower of them\nall may yet not know the whole of everything, or even know what he\ndoes know at one single stroke:–he may be liable to forget.\nWhichever type obtained, the world would still be a universe\nnoetically. Its parts would be conjoined by knowledge, but in the\none case the knowledge would be absolutely unified, in the other it\nwould be strung along and overlapped.",
        "The notion of one instantaneous or eternal Knower–either adjective\nhere means the same thing–is, as I said, the great intellectualist\nachievement of our time. It has practically driven out that\nconception of ’Substance’ which earlier philosophers set such store\nby, and by which so much unifying work used to be done–universal\nsubstance which alone has being in and from itself, and of which all\nthe particulars of experience are but forms to which it gives\nsupport. Substance has succumbed to the pragmatic criticisms of the\nEnglish school. It appears now only as another name for the fact\nthat phenomena as they come are actually grouped and given in\ncoherent forms, the very forms in which we finite knowers experience\nor think them together. These forms of conjunction are as much parts\nof the tissue of experience as are the terms which they connect; and\nit is a great pragmatic achievement for recent idealism to have made\nthe world hang together in these directly representable ways instead\nof drawing its unity from the ’inherence’ of its parts–whatever\nthat may mean–in an unimaginable principle behind the scenes.",
        "’The world is one,’ therefore, just so far as we experience it to be\nconcatenated, one by as many definite conjunctions as appear. But\nthen also NOT one by just as many definite DISjunctions as we find.\nThe oneness and the manyness of it thus obtain in respects which can\nbe separately named. It is neither a universe pure and simple nor a\nmultiverse pure and simple. And its various manners of being one\nsuggest, for their accurate ascertainment, so many distinct programs\nof scientific work. Thus the pragmatic question ’What is the oneness\nknown-as? What practical difference will it make?’ saves us from all\nfeverish excitement over it as a principle of sublimity and carries\nus forward into the stream of experience with a cool head. The\nstream may indeed reveal far more connexion and union than we now\nsuspect, but we are not entitled on pragmatic principles to claim\nabsolute oneness in any respect in advance.",
        "It is so difficult to see definitely what absolute oneness can mean,\nthat probably the majority of you are satisfied with the sober\nattitude which we have reached. Nevertheless there are possibly some\nradically monistic souls among you who are not content to leave the\none and the many on a par. Union of various grades, union of diverse\ntypes, union that stops at non-conductors, union that merely goes\nfrom next to next, and means in many cases outer nextness only, and\nnot a more internal bond, union of concatenation, in short; all that\nsort of thing seems to you a halfway stage of thought. The oneness\nof things, superior to their manyness, you think must also be more\ndeeply true, must be the more real aspect of the world. The\npragmatic view, you are sure, gives us a universe imperfectly\nrational. The real universe must form an unconditional unit of\nbeing, something consolidated, with its parts co-implicated through\nand through. Only then could we consider our estate completely\nrational. There is no doubt whatever that this ultra-monistic way of\nthinking means a great deal to many minds. “One Life, One Truth, one\nLove, one Principle, One Good, One God\"–I quote from a Christian\nScience leaflet which the day’s mail brings into my hands–beyond\ndoubt such a confession of faith has pragmatically an emotional\nvalue, and beyond doubt the word ’one’ contributes to the value\nquite as much as the other words. But if we try to realize\nINTELLECTUALLY what we can possibly MEAN by such a glut of oneness\nwe are thrown right back upon our pragmatistic determinations again.\nIt means either the mere name One, the universe of discourse; or it\nmeans the sum total of all the ascertainable particular conjunctions\nand concatenations; or, finally, it means some one vehicle of\nconjunction treated as all-inclusive, like one origin, one purpose,\nor one knower. In point of fact it always means one KNOWER to those\nwho take it intellectually to-day. The one knower involves, they\nthink, the other forms of conjunction. His world must have all its\nparts co-implicated in the one logical-aesthetical-teleological\nunit-picture which is his eternal dream.",
        "The character of the absolute knower’s picture is however so\nimpossible for us to represent clearly, that we may fairly suppose\nthat the authority which absolute monism undoubtedly possesses, and\nprobably always will possess over some persons, draws its strength\nfar less from intellectual than from mystical grounds. To interpret\nabsolute monism worthily, be a mystic. Mystical states of mind in\nevery degree are shown by history, usually tho not always, to make\nfor the monistic view. This is no proper occasion to enter upon the\ngeneral subject of mysticism, but I will quote one mystical\npronouncement to show just what I mean. The paragon of all monistic\nsystems is the Vedanta philosophy of Hindostan, and the paragon of\nVedantist missionaries was the late Swami Vivekananda who visited\nour shores some years ago. The method of Vedantism is the mystical\nmethod. You do not reason, but after going through a certain\ndiscipline YOU SEE, and having seen, you can report the truth.\nVivekananda thus reports the truth in one of his lectures here:",
        "“Where is any more misery for him who sees this Oneness in the\nUniverse...this Oneness of life, Oneness of everything? ...This\nseparation between man and man, man and woman, man and child, nation\nfrom nation, earth from moon, moon from sun, this separation between\natom and atom is the cause really of all the misery, and the Vedanta\nsays this separation does not exist, it is not real. It is merely\napparent, on the surface. In the heart of things there is Unity\nstill. If you go inside you find that Unity between man and man,\nwomen and children, races and races, high and low, rich and poor,\nthe gods and men: all are One, and animals too, if you go deep\nenough, and he who has attained to that has no more delusion. ...\nWhere is any more delusion for him? What can delude him? He knows\nthe reality of everything, the secret of everything. Where is there\nany more misery for him? What does he desire? He has traced the\nreality of everything unto the Lord, that centre, that Unity of\neverything, and that is Eternal Bliss, Eternal Knowledge, Eternal\nExistence. Neither death nor disease, nor sorrow nor misery, nor\ndiscontent is there ... in the centre, the reality, there is no one\nto be mourned for, no one to be sorry for. He has penetrated\neverything, the Pure One, the Formless, the Bodiless, the Stainless,\nHe the Knower, He the Great Poet, the Self-Existent, He who is\ngiving to everyone what he deserves.”",
        "Observe how radical the character of the monism here is. Separation\nis not simply overcome by the One, it is denied to exist. There is\nno many. We are not parts of the One; It has no parts; and since in\na sense we undeniably ARE, it must be that each of us is the One,\nindivisibly and totally. AN ABSOLUTE ONE, AND I THAT ONE–surely we\nhave here a religion which, emotionally considered, has a high\npragmatic value; it imparts a perfect sumptuosity of security. As\nour Swami says in another place:",
        "“When man has seen himself as one with the infinite Being of the\nuniverse, when all separateness has ceased, when all men, all women,\nall angels, all gods, all animals, all plants, the whole universe\nhas been melted into that oneness, then all fear disappears. Whom to\nfear? Can I hurt myself? Can I kill myself? Can I injure myself? Do\nyou fear yourself? Then will all sorrow disappear. What can cause me\nsorrow? I am the One Existence of the universe. Then all jealousies\nwill disappear; of whom to be jealous? Of myself? Then all bad\nfeelings disappear. Against whom will I have this bad feeling?\nAgainst myself? There is none in the universe but me. ... Kill out\nthis differentiation; kill out this superstition that there are\nmany. ’He who, in this world of many, sees that One; he who in this\nmass of insentiency sees that One Sentient Being; he who in this\nworld of shadow catches that Reality, unto him belongs eternal\npeace, unto none else, unto none else.’”",
        "We all have some ear for this monistic music: it elevates and\nreassures. We all have at least the germ of mysticism in us. And\nwhen our idealists recite their arguments for the Absolute, saying\nthat the slightest union admitted anywhere carries logically\nabsolute Oneness with it, and that the slightest separation admitted\nanywhere logically carries disunion remediless and complete, I\ncannot help suspecting that the palpable weak places in the\nintellectual reasonings they use are protected from their own\ncriticism by a mystical feeling that, logic or no logic, absolute\nOneness must somehow at any cost be true. Oneness overcomes MORAL\nseparateness at any rate. In the passion of love we have the mystic\ngerm of what might mean a total union of all sentient life. This\nmystical germ wakes up in us on hearing the monistic utterances,\nacknowledges their authority, and assigns to intellectual\nconsiderations a secondary place.",
        "I will dwell no longer on these religious and moral aspects of the\nquestion in this lecture. When I come to my final lecture there will\nbe something more to say.",
        "Leave then out of consideration for the moment the authority which\nmystical insights may be conjectured eventually to possess; treat\nthe problem of the One and the Many in a purely intellectual way;\nand we see clearly enough where pragmatism stands. With her\ncriterion of the practical differences that theories make, we see\nthat she must equally abjure absolute monism and absolute pluralism.\nThe world is one just so far as its parts hang together by any\ndefinite connexion. It is many just so far as any definite connexion\nfails to obtain. And finally it is growing more and more unified by\nthose systems of connexion at least which human energy keeps framing\nas time goes on.",
        "It is possible to imagine alternative universes to the one we know,\nin which the most various grades and types of union should be\nembodied. Thus the lowest grade of universe would be a world of mere\nWITHNESS, of which the parts were only strung together by the\nconjunction ’and.’ Such a universe is even now the collection of our\nseveral inner lives. The spaces and times of your imagination, the\nobjects and events of your day-dreams are not only more or less\nincoherent inter se, but are wholly out of definite relation with\nthe similar contents of anyone else’s mind. Our various reveries now\nas we sit here compenetrate each other idly without influencing or\ninterfering. They coexist, but in no order and in no receptacle,\nbeing the nearest approach to an absolute ’many’ that we can\nconceive. We cannot even imagine any reason why they SHOULD be known\nall together, and we can imagine even less, if they were known\ntogether, how they could be known as one systematic whole.",
        "But add our sensations and bodily actions, and the union mounts to a\nmuch higher grade. Our audita et visa and our acts fall into those\nreceptacles of time and space in which each event finds its date and\nplace. They form ’things’ and are of ’kinds’ too, and can be\nclassed. Yet we can imagine a world of things and of kinds in which\nthe causal interactions with which we are so familiar should not\nexist. Everything there might be inert towards everything else, and\nrefuse to propagate its influence. Or gross mechanical influences\nmight pass, but no chemical action. Such worlds would be far less\nunified than ours. Again there might be complete physico-chemical\ninteraction, but no minds; or minds, but altogether private ones,\nwith no social life; or social life limited to acquaintance, but no\nlove; or love, but no customs or institutions that should\nsystematize it. No one of these grades of universe would be\nabsolutely irrational or disintegrated, inferior tho it might appear\nwhen looked at from the higher grades. For instance, if our minds\nshould ever become ’telepathically’ connected, so that we knew\nimmediately, or could under certain conditions know immediately,\neach what the other was thinking, the world we now live in would\nappear to the thinkers in that world to have been of an inferior\ngrade.",
        "With the whole of past eternity open for our conjectures to range\nin, it may be lawful to wonder whether the various kinds of union\nnow realized in the universe that we inhabit may not possibly have\nbeen successively evolved after the fashion in which we now see\nhuman systems evolving in consequence of human needs. If such an\nhypothesis were legitimate, total oneness would appear at the end of\nthings rather than at their origin. In other words the notion of the\n’Absolute’ would have to be replaced by that of the ’Ultimate.’ The\ntwo notions would have the same content–the maximally unified\ncontent of fact, namely–but their time-relations would be\npositively reversed. [Footnote: Compare on the Ultimate, Mr.\nSchiller’s essay “Activity and Substance,” in his book entitled\nHumanism, p. 204.]",
        "After discussing the unity of the universe in this pragmatic way,\nyou ought to see why I said in my second lecture, borrowing the word\nfrom my friend G. Papini, that pragmatism tends to UNSTIFFEN all our\ntheories. The world’s oneness has generally been affirmed abstractly\nonly, and as if anyone who questioned it must be an idiot. The\ntemper of monists has been so vehement, as almost at times to be\nconvulsive; and this way of holding a doctrine does not easily go\nwith reasonable discussion and the drawing of distinctions. The\ntheory of the Absolute, in particular, has had to be an article of\nfaith, affirmed dogmatically and exclusively. The One and All, first\nin the order of being and of knowing, logically necessary itself,\nand uniting all lesser things in the bonds of mutual necessity, how\ncould it allow of any mitigation of its inner rigidity? The\nslightest suspicion of pluralism, the minutest wiggle of\nindependence of any one of its parts from the control of the\ntotality, would ruin it. Absolute unity brooks no degrees–as well\nmight you claim absolute purity for a glass of water because it\ncontains but a single little cholera-germ. The independence, however\ninfinitesimal, of a part, however small, would be to the Absolute as\nfatal as a cholera-germ.",
        "Pluralism on the other hand has no need of this dogmatic rigoristic\ntemper. Provided you grant SOME separation among things, some tremor\nof independence, some free play of parts on one another, some real\nnovelty or chance, however minute, she is amply satisfied, and will\nallow you any amount, however great, of real union. How much of\nunion there may be is a question that she thinks can only be decided\nempirically. The amount may be enormous, colossal; but absolute\nmonism is shattered if, along with all the union, there has to be\ngranted the slightest modicum, the most incipient nascency, or the\nmost residual trace, of a separation that is not ’overcome.’",
        "Pragmatism, pending the final empirical ascertainment of just what\nthe balance of union and disunion among things may be, must\nobviously range herself upon the pluralistic side. Some day, she\nadmits, even total union, with one knower, one origin, and a\nuniverse consolidated in every conceivable way, may turn out to be\nthe most acceptable of all hypotheses. Meanwhile the opposite\nhypothesis, of a world imperfectly unified still, and perhaps always\nto remain so, must be sincerely entertained. This latter hypothesis\nis pluralism’s doctrine. Since absolute monism forbids its being\neven considered seriously, branding it as irrational from the start,\nit is clear that pragmatism must turn its back on absolute monism,\nand follow pluralism’s more empirical path.",
        "This leaves us with the common-sense world, in which we find things\npartly joined and partly disjoined. ’Things,’ then, and their\n’conjunctions’–what do such words mean, pragmatically handled? In\nmy next lecture, I will apply the pragmatic method to the stage of\nphilosophizing known as Common Sense.",
        "In the last lecture we turned ourselves from the usual way of\ntalking of the universe’s oneness as a principle, sublime in all its\nblankness, towards a study of the special kinds of union which the\nuniverse enfolds. We found many of these to coexist with kinds of\nseparation equally real. “How far am I verified?” is the question\nwhich each kind of union and each kind of separation asks us here,\nso as good pragmatists we have to turn our face towards experience,\ntowards ’facts.’",
        "Absolute oneness remains, but only as an hypothesis, and that\nhypothesis is reduced nowadays to that of an omniscient knower who\nsees all things without exception as forming one single systematic\nfact. But the knower in question may still be conceived either as an\nAbsolute or as an Ultimate; and over against the hypothesis of him\nin either form the counter-hypothesis that the widest field of\nknowledge that ever was or will be still contains some ignorance,\nmay be legitimately held. Some bits of information always may\nescape.",
        "This is the hypothesis of NOETIC PLURALISM, which monists consider\nso absurd. Since we are bound to treat it as respectfully as noetic\nmonism, until the facts shall have tipped the beam, we find that our\npragmatism, tho originally nothing but a method, has forced us to be\nfriendly to the pluralistic view. It MAY be that some parts of the\nworld are connected so loosely with some other parts as to be strung\nalong by nothing but the copula AND. They might even come and go\nwithout those other parts suffering any internal change. This\npluralistic view, of a world of ADDITIVE constitution, is one that\npragmatism is unable to rule out from serious consideration. But\nthis view leads one to the farther hypothesis that the actual world,\ninstead of being complete ’eternally,’ as the monists assure us, may\nbe eternally incomplete, and at all times subject to addition or\nliable to loss.",
        "It IS at any rate incomplete in one respect, and flagrantly so. The\nvery fact that we debate this question shows that our KNOWLEDGE is\nincomplete at present and subject to addition. In respect of the\nknowledge it contains the world does genuinely change and grow. Some\ngeneral remarks on the way in which our knowledge completes itself–\nwhen it does complete itself–will lead us very conveniently into\nour subject for this lecture, which is ’Common Sense.’",
        "To begin with, our knowledge grows IN SPOTS. The spots may be large\nor small, but the knowledge never grows all over: some old knowledge\nalways remains what it was. Your knowledge of pragmatism, let us\nsuppose, is growing now. Later, its growth may involve considerable\nmodification of opinions which you previously held to be true. But\nsuch modifications are apt to be gradual. To take the nearest\npossible example, consider these lectures of mine. What you first\ngain from them is probably a small amount of new information, a few\nnew definitions, or distinctions, or points of view. But while these\nspecial ideas are being added, the rest of your knowledge stands\nstill, and only gradually will you ’line up’ your previous opinions\nwith the novelties I am trying to instil, and modify to some slight\ndegree their mass.",
        "You listen to me now, I suppose, with certain prepossessions as to\nmy competency, and these affect your reception of what I say, but\nwere I suddenly to break off lecturing, and to begin to sing ’We\nwon’t go home till morning’ in a rich baritone voice, not only would\nthat new fact be added to your stock, but it would oblige you to\ndefine me differently, and that might alter your opinion of the\npragmatic philosophy, and in general bring about a rearrangement of\na number of your ideas. Your mind in such processes is strained, and\nsometimes painfully so, between its older beliefs and the novelties\nwhich experience brings along.",
        "Our minds thus grow in spots; and like grease-spots, the spots\nspread. But we let them spread as little as possible: we keep\nunaltered as much of our old knowledge, as many of our old\nprejudices and beliefs, as we can. We patch and tinker more than we\nrenew. The novelty soaks in; it stains the ancient mass; but it is\nalso tinged by what absorbs it. Our past apperceives and co-\noperates; and in the new equilibrium in which each step forward in\nthe process of learning terminates, it happens relatively seldom\nthat the new fact is added RAW. More usually it is embedded cooked,\nas one might say, or stewed down in the sauce of the old.",
        "New truths thus are resultants of new experiences and of old truths\ncombined and mutually modifying one another. And since this is the\ncase in the changes of opinion of to-day, there is no reason to\nassume that it has not been so at all times. It follows that very\nancient modes of thought may have survived through all the later\nchanges in men’s opinions. The most primitive ways of thinking may\nnot yet be wholly expunged. Like our five fingers, our ear-bones,\nour rudimentary caudal appendage, or our other ’vestigial’\npeculiarities, they may remain as indelible tokens of events in our\nrace-history. Our ancestors may at certain moments have struck into\nways of thinking which they might conceivably not have found. But\nonce they did so, and after the fact, the inheritance continues.\nWhen you begin a piece of music in a certain key, you must keep the\nkey to the end. You may alter your house ad libitum, but the ground-\nplan of the first architect persists–you can make great changes,\nbut you cannot change a Gothic church into a Doric temple. You may\nrinse and rinse the bottle, but you can’t get the taste of the\nmedicine or whiskey that first filled it wholly out.",
        "My thesis now is this, that OUR FUNDAMENTAL WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT\nTHINGS ARE DISCOVERIES OF EXCEEDINGLY REMOTE ANCESTORS, WHICH HAVE\nBEEN ABLE TO PRESERVE THEMSELVES THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF ALL\nSUBSEQUENT TIME. They form one great stage of equilibrium in the\nhuman mind’s development, the stage of common sense. Other stages\nhave grafted themselves upon this stage, but have never succeeded in\ndisplacing it. Let us consider this common-sense stage first, as if\nit might be final.",
        "In practical talk, a man’s common sense means his good judgment, his\nfreedom from excentricity, his GUMPTION, to use the vernacular word.\nIn philosophy it means something entirely different, it means his\nuse of certain intellectual forms or categories of thought. Were we\nlobsters, or bees, it might be that our organization would have led\nto our using quite different modes from these of apprehending our\nexperiences. It MIGHT be too (we cannot dogmatically deny this) that\nsuch categories, unimaginable by us to-day, would have proved on the\nwhole as serviceable for handling our experiences mentally as those\nwhich we actually use.",
        "If this sounds paradoxical to anyone, let him think of analytical\ngeometry. The identical figures which Euclid defined by intrinsic\nrelations were defined by Descartes by the relations of their points\nto adventitious co-ordinates, the result being an absolutely\ndifferent and vastly more potent way of handling curves. All our\nconceptions are what the Germans call denkmittel, means by which we\nhandle facts by thinking them. Experience merely as such doesn’t\ncome ticketed and labeled, we have first to discover what it is.\nKant speaks of it as being in its first intention a gewuehl der\nerscheinungen, a rhapsodie der wahrnehmungen, a mere motley which we\nhave to unify by our wits. What we usually do is first to frame some\nsystem of concepts mentally classified, serialized, or connected in\nsome intellectual way, and then to use this as a tally by which we\n’keep tab’ on the impressions that present themselves. When each is\nreferred to some possible place in the conceptual system, it is\nthereby ’understood.’ This notion of parallel ’manifolds’ with their\nelements standing reciprocally in ’one-to-one relations,’ is proving\nso convenient nowadays in mathematics and logic as to supersede more\nand more the older classificatory conceptions. There are many\nconceptual systems of this sort; and the sense manifold is also such\na system. Find a one-to-one relation for your sense-impressions\nANYWHERE among the concepts, and in so far forth you rationalize the\nimpressions. But obviously you can rationalize them by using various\nconceptual systems.",
        "The old common-sense way of rationalizing them is by a set of\nconcepts of which the most important are these:",
        "Thing;",
        "The same or different;",
        "Kinds;",
        "Minds;",
        "Bodies;",
        "One Time;",
        "One Space;",
        "Subjects and attributes;",
        "Causal influences;",
        "The fancied;",
        "The real.",
        "We are now so familiar with the order that these notions have woven\nfor us out of the everlasting weather of our perceptions that we\nfind it hard to realize how little of a fixed routine the\nperceptions follow when taken by themselves. The word weather is a\ngood one to use here. In Boston, for example, the weather has almost\nno routine, the only law being that if you have had any weather for\ntwo days, you will probably but not certainly have another weather\non the third. Weather-experience as it thus comes to Boston, is\ndiscontinuous and chaotic. In point of temperature, of wind, rain or\nsunshine, it MAY change three times a day. But the Washington\nweather-bureau intellectualizes this disorder by making each\nsuccessive bit of Boston weather EPISODIC. It refers it to its place\nand moment in a continental cyclone, on the history of which the\nlocal changes everywhere are strung as beads are strung upon a cord.",
        "Now it seems almost certain that young children and the inferior\nanimals take all their experiences very much as uninstructed\nBostonians take their weather. They know no more of time or space as\nworld-receptacles, or of permanent subjects and changing predicates,\nor of causes, or kinds, or thoughts, or things, than our common\npeople know of continental cyclones. A baby’s rattle drops out of\nhis hand, but the baby looks not for it. It has ’gone out’ for him,\nas a candle-flame goes out; and it comes back, when you replace it\nin his hand, as the flame comes back when relit. The idea of its\nbeing a ’thing,’ whose permanent existence by itself he might\ninterpolate between its successive apparitions has evidently not\noccurred to him. It is the same with dogs. Out of sight, out of\nmind, with them. It is pretty evident that they have no GENERAL\ntendency to interpolate ’things.’ Let me quote here a passage from\nmy colleague G. Santayana’s book.",
        "“If a dog, while sniffing about contentedly, sees afar off his\nmaster arriving after long absence...the poor brute asks for no\nreason why his master went, why he has come again, why he should be\nloved, or why presently while lying at his feet you forget him and\nbegin to grunt and dream of the chase–all that is an utter mystery,\nutterly unconsidered. Such experience has variety, scenery, and a\ncertain vital rhythm; its story might be told in dithyrambic verse.\nIt moves wholly by inspiration; every event is providential, every\nact unpremeditated. Absolute freedom and absolute helplessness have\nmet together: you depend wholly on divine favour, yet that\nunfathomable agency is not distinguishable from your own life.\n...[But] the figures even of that disordered drama have their exits\nand their entrances; and their cues can be gradually discovered by a\nbeing capable of fixing his attention and retaining the order of\nevents. ...In proportion as such understanding advances each moment\nof experience becomes consequential and prophetic of the rest. The\ncalm places in life are filled with power and its spasms with\nresource. No emotion can overwhelm the mind, for of none is the\nbasis or issue wholly hidden; no event can disconcert it altogether,\nbecause it sees beyond. Means can be looked for to escape from the\nworst predicament; and whereas each moment had been formerly filled\nwith nothing but its own adventure and surprised emotion, each now\nmakes room for the lesson of what went before and surmises what may\nbe the plot of the whole.\"[Footnote: The Life of Reason: Reason in\nCommon Sense, 1905, p. 59.]",
        "Even to-day science and philosophy are still laboriously trying to\npart fancies from realities in our experience; and in primitive\ntimes they made only the most incipient distinctions in this line.\nMen believed whatever they thought with any liveliness, and they\nmixed their dreams with their realities inextricably. The categories\nof ’thought’ and ’things’ are indispensable here–instead of being\nrealities we now call certain experiences only ’thoughts.’ There is\nnot a category, among those enumerated, of which we may not imagine\nthe use to have thus originated historically and only gradually\nspread.",
        "That one Time which we all believe in and in which each event has\nits definite date, that one Space in which each thing has its\nposition, these abstract notions unify the world incomparably; but\nin their finished shape as concepts how different they are from the\nloose unordered time-and-space experiences of natural men!\nEverything that happens to us brings its own duration and extension,\nand both are vaguely surrounded by a marginal ’more’ that runs into\nthe duration and extension of the next thing that comes. But we soon\nlose all our definite bearings; and not only do our children make no\ndistinction between yesterday and the day before yesterday, the\nwhole past being churned up together, but we adults still do so\nwhenever the times are large. It is the same with spaces. On a map I\ncan distinctly see the relation of London, Constantinople, and Pekin\nto the place where I am; in reality I utterly fail to FEEL the facts\nwhich the map symbolizes. The directions and distances are vague,\nconfused and mixed. Cosmic space and cosmic time, so far from being\nthe intuitions that Kant said they were, are constructions as\npatently artificial as any that science can show. The great majority\nof the human race never use these notions, but live in plural times\nand spaces, interpenetrant and DURCHEINANDER.",
        "Permanent ’things’ again; the ’same’ thing and its various\n’appearances’ and ’alterations’; the different ’kinds’ of thing;\nwith the ’kind’ used finally as a ’predicate,’ of which the thing\nremains the ’subject’–what a straightening of the tangle of our\nexperience’s immediate flux and sensible variety does this list of\nterms suggest! And it is only the smallest part of his experience’s\nflux that anyone actually does straighten out by applying to it\nthese conceptual instruments. Out of them all our lowest ancestors\nprobably used only, and then most vaguely and inaccurately, the\nnotion of ’the same again.’ But even then if you had asked them\nwhether the same were a ’thing’ that had endured throughout the\nunseen interval, they would probably have been at a loss, and would\nhave said that they had never asked that question, or considered\nmatters in that light.",
        "Kinds, and sameness of kind–what colossally useful DENKMITTEL for\nfinding our way among the many! The manyness might conceivably have\nbeen absolute. Experiences might have all been singulars, no one of\nthem occurring twice. In such a world logic would have had no\napplication; for kind and sameness of kind are logic’s only\ninstruments. Once we know that whatever is of a kind is also of that\nkind’s kind, we can travel through the universe as if with seven-\nleague boots. Brutes surely never use these abstractions, and\ncivilized men use them in most various amounts.",
        "Causal influence, again! This, if anything, seems to have been an\nantediluvian conception; for we find primitive men thinking that\nalmost everything is significant and can exert influence of some\nsort. The search for the more definite influences seems to have\nstarted in the question: “Who, or what, is to blame?\"–for any\nillness, namely, or disaster, or untoward thing. From this centre\nthe search for causal influences has spread. Hume and ’Science’\ntogether have tried to eliminate the whole notion of influence,\nsubstituting the entirely different DENKMITTEL of ’law.’ But law is\na comparatively recent invention, and influence reigns supreme in\nthe older realm of common sense.",
        "The ’possible,’ as something less than the actual and more than the\nwholly unreal, is another of these magisterial notions of common\nsense. Criticize them as you may, they persist; and we fly back to\nthem the moment critical pressure is relaxed. ’Self,’ ’body,’ in the\nsubstantial or metaphysical sense–no one escapes subjection to\nTHOSE forms of thought. In practice, the common-sense DENKMITTEL are\nuniformly victorious. Everyone, however instructed, still thinks of\na ’thing’ in the common-sense way, as a permanent unit-subject that\n’supports’ its attributes interchangeably. No one stably or\nsincerely uses the more critical notion, of a group of sense-\nqualities united by a law. With these categories in our hand, we\nmake our plans and plot together, and connect all the remoter parts\nof experience with what lies before our eyes. Our later and more\ncritical philosophies are mere fads and fancies compared with this\nnatural mother-tongue of thought.",
        "Common sense appears thus as a perfectly definite stage in our\nunderstanding of things, a stage that satisfies in an\nextraordinarily successful way the purposes for which we think.\n’Things’ do exist, even when we do not see them. Their ’kinds’ also\nexist. Their ’qualities’ are what they act by, and are what we act\non; and these also exist. These lamps shed their quality of light on\nevery object in this room. We intercept IT on its way whenever we\nhold up an opaque screen. It is the very sound that my lips emit\nthat travels into your ears. It is the sensible heat of the fire\nthat migrates into the water in which we boil an egg; and we can\nchange the heat into coolness by dropping in a lump of ice. At this\nstage of philosophy all non-European men without exception have\nremained. It suffices for all the necessary practical ends of life;\nand, among our own race even, it is only the highly sophisticated\nspecimens, the minds debauched by learning, as Berkeley calls them,\nwho have ever even suspected common sense of not being absolutely\ntrue.",
        "But when we look back, and speculate as to how the common-sense\ncategories may have achieved their wonderful supremacy, no reason\nappears why it may not have been by a process just like that by\nwhich the conceptions due to Democritus, Berkeley, or Darwin,\nachieved their similar triumphs in more recent times. In other\nwords, they may have been successfully DISCOVERED by prehistoric\ngeniuses whose names the night of antiquity has covered up; they may\nhave been verified by the immediate facts of experience which they\nfirst fitted; and then from fact to fact and from man to man they\nmay have SPREAD, until all language rested on them and we are now\nincapable of thinking naturally in any other terms. Such a view\nwould only follow the rule that has proved elsewhere so fertile, of\nassuming the vast and remote to conform to the laws of formation\nthat we can observe at work in the small and near.",
        "For all utilitarian practical purposes these conceptions amply\nsuffice; but that they began at special points of discovery and only\ngradually spread from one thing to another, seems proved by the\nexceedingly dubious limits of their application to-day. We assume\nfor certain purposes one ’objective’ Time that AEQUABILITER FLUIT,\nbut we don’t livingly believe in or realize any such equally-flowing\ntime. ’Space’ is a less vague notion; but ’things,’ what are they?\nIs a constellation properly a thing? or an army? or is an ENS\nRATIONIS such as space or justice a thing? Is a knife whose handle\nand blade are changed the ’same’? Is the ’changeling,’ whom Locke so\nseriously discusses, of the human ’kind’? Is ’telepathy’ a ’fancy’\nor a ’fact’? The moment you pass beyond the practical use of these\ncategories (a use usually suggested sufficiently by the\ncircumstances of the special case) to a merely curious or\nspeculative way of thinking, you find it impossible to say within\njust what limits of fact any one of them shall apply.",
        "The peripatetic philosophy, obeying rationalist propensities, has\ntried to eternalize the common-sense categories by treating them\nvery technically and articulately. A ’thing’ for instance is a\nbeing, or ENS. An ENS is a subject in which qualities ’inhere.’ A\nsubject is a substance. Substances are of kinds, and kinds are\ndefinite in number, and discrete. These distinctions are fundamental\nand eternal. As terms of DISCOURSE they are indeed magnificently\nuseful, but what they mean, apart from their use in steering our\ndiscourse to profitable issues, does not appear. If you ask a\nscholastic philosopher what a substance may be in itself, apart from\nits being the support of attributes, he simply says that your\nintellect knows perfectly what the word means.",
        "But what the intellect knows clearly is only the word itself and its\nsteering function. So it comes about that intellects SIBI PERMISSI,\nintellects only curious and idle, have forsaken the common-sense\nlevel for what in general terms may be called the ’critical’ level\nof thought. Not merely SUCH intellects either–your Humes and\nBerkeleys and Hegels; but practical observers of facts, your\nGalileos, Daltons, Faradays, have found it impossible to treat the\nNAIFS sense-termini of common sense as ultimately real. As common\nsense interpolates her constant ’things’ between our intermittent\nsensations, so science EXTRApolates her world of ’primary’\nqualities, her atoms, her ether, her magnetic fields, and the like,\nbeyond the common-sense world. The ’things’ are now invisible\nimpalpable things; and the old visible common-sense things are\nsupposed to result from the mixture of these invisibles. Or else the\nwhole NAIF conception of thing gets superseded, and a thing’s name\nis interpreted as denoting only the law or REGEL DER VERBINDUNG by\nwhich certain of our sensations habitually succeed or coexist.",
        "Science and critical philosophy thus burst the bounds of common\nsense. With science NAIF realism ceases: ’Secondary’ qualities\nbecome unreal; primary ones alone remain. With critical philosophy,\nhavoc is made of everything. The common-sense categories one and all\ncease to represent anything in the way of BEING; they are but\nsublime tricks of human thought, our ways of escaping bewilderment\nin the midst of sensation’s irremediable flow.",
        "But the scientific tendency in critical thought, tho inspired at\nfirst by purely intellectual motives, has opened an entirely\nunexpected range of practical utilities to our astonished view.\nGalileo gave us accurate clocks and accurate artillery-practice; the\nchemists flood us with new medicines and dye-stuffs; Ampere and\nFaraday have endowed us with the New York subway and with Marconi\ntelegrams. The hypothetical things that such men have invented,\ndefined as they have defined them, are showing an extraordinary\nfertility in consequences verifiable by sense. Our logic can deduce\nfrom them a consequence due under certain conditions, we can then\nbring about the conditions, and presto, the consequence is there\nbefore our eyes. The scope of the practical control of nature newly\nput into our hand by scientific ways of thinking vastly exceeds the\nscope of the old control grounded on common sense. Its rate of\nincrease accelerates so that no one can trace the limit; one may\neven fear that the BEING of man may be crushed by his own powers,\nthat his fixed nature as an organism may not prove adequate to stand\nthe strain of the ever increasingly tremendous functions, almost\ndivine creative functions, which his intellect will more and more\nenable him to wield. He may drown in his wealth like a child in a\nbath-tub, who has turned on the water and who cannot turn it off.",
        "The philosophic stage of criticism, much more thorough in its\nnegations than the scientific stage, so far gives us no new range of\npractical power. Locke, Hume, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, have all been\nutterly sterile, so far as shedding any light on the details of\nnature goes, and I can think of no invention or discovery that can\nbe directly traced to anything in their peculiar thought, for\nneither with Berkeley’s tar-water nor with Kant’s nebular hypothesis\nhad their respective philosophic tenets anything to do. The\nsatisfactions they yield to their disciples are intellectual, not\npractical; and even then we have to confess that there is a large\nminus-side to the account.",
        "There are thus at least three well-characterized levels, stages or\ntypes of thought about the world we live in, and the notions of one\nstage have one kind of merit, those of another stage another kind.\nIt is impossible, however, to say that any stage as yet in sight is\nabsolutely more TRUE than any other. Common sense is the more\nCONSOLIDATED stage, because it got its innings first, and made all\nlanguage into its ally. Whether it or science be the more AUGUST\nstage may be left to private judgment. But neither consolidation nor\naugustness are decisive marks of truth. If common sense were true,\nwhy should science have had to brand the secondary qualities, to\nwhich our world owes all its living interest, as false, and to\ninvent an invisible world of points and curves and mathematical\nequations instead? Why should it have needed to transform causes and\nactivities into laws of ’functional variation’? Vainly did\nscholasticism, common sense’s college-trained younger sister, seek\nto stereotype the forms the human family had always talked with, to\nmake them definite and fix them for eternity. Substantial forms (in\nother words our secondary qualities) hardly outlasted the year of\nour Lord 1600. People were already tired of them then; and Galileo,\nand Descartes, with his ’new philosophy,’ gave them only a little\nlater their coup de grace.",
        "But now if the new kinds of scientific ’thing,’ the corpuscular and\netheric world, were essentially more ’true,’ why should they have\nexcited so much criticism within the body of science itself?\nScientific logicians are saying on every hand that these entities\nand their determinations, however definitely conceived, should not\nbe held for literally real. It is AS IF they existed; but in reality\nthey are like co-ordinates or logarithms, only artificial short-cuts\nfor taking us from one part to another of experience’s flux. We can\ncipher fruitfully with them; they serve us wonderfully; but we must\nnot be their dupes.",
        "There is no RINGING conclusion possible when we compare these types\nof thinking, with a view to telling which is the more absolutely\ntrue. Their naturalness, their intellectual economy, their\nfruitfulness for practice, all start up as distinct tests of their\nveracity, and as a result we get confused. Common sense is BETTER\nfor one sphere of life, science for another, philosophic criticism\nfor a third; but whether either be TRUER absolutely, Heaven only\nknows. Just now, if I understand the matter rightly, we are\nwitnessing a curious reversion to the common-sense way of looking at\nphysical nature, in the philosophy of science favored by such men as\nMach, Ostwald and Duhem. According to these teachers no hypothesis\nis truer than any other in the sense of being a more literal copy of\nreality. They are all but ways of talking on our part, to be\ncompared solely from the point of view of their USE. The only\nliterally true thing is REALITY; and the only reality we know is,\nfor these logicians, sensible reality, the flux of our sensations\nand emotions as they pass. ’Energy’ is the collective name\n(according to Ostwald) for the sensations just as they present\nthemselves (the movement, heat, magnetic pull, or light, or whatever\nit may be) when they are measured in certain ways. So measuring\nthem, we are enabled to describe the correlated changes which they\nshow us, in formulas matchless for their simplicity and fruitfulness\nfor human use. They are sovereign triumphs of economy in thought.",
        "No one can fail to admire the ’energetic’ philosophy. But the\nhypersensible entities, the corpuscles and vibrations, hold their\nown with most physicists and chemists, in spite of its appeal. It\nseems too economical to be all-sufficient. Profusion, not economy,\nmay after all be reality’s key-note.",
        "I am dealing here with highly technical matters, hardly suitable for\npopular lecturing, and in which my own competence is small. All the\nbetter for my conclusion, however, which at this point is this. The\nwhole notion of truth, which naturally and without reflexion we\nassume to mean the simple duplication by the mind of a ready-made\nand given reality, proves hard to understand clearly. There is no\nsimple test available for adjudicating offhand between the divers\ntypes of thought that claim to possess it. Common sense, common\nscience or corpuscular philosophy, ultra-critical science, or\nenergetics, and critical or idealistic philosophy, all seem\ninsufficiently true in some regard and leave some dissatisfaction.\nIt is evident that the conflict of these so widely differing systems\nobliges us to overhaul the very idea of truth, for at present we\nhave no definite notion of what the word may mean. I shall face that\ntask in my next lecture, and will add but a few words, in finishing\nthe present one.",
        "There are only two points that I wish you to retain from the present\nlecture. The first one relates to common sense. We have seen reason\nto suspect it, to suspect that in spite of their being so venerable,\nof their being so universally used and built into the very structure\nof language, its categories may after all be only a collection of\nextraordinarily successful hypotheses (historically discovered or\ninvented by single men, but gradually communicated, and used by\neverybody) by which our forefathers have from time immemorial\nunified and straightened the discontinuity of their immediate\nexperiences, and put themselves into an equilibrium with the surface\nof nature so satisfactory for ordinary practical purposes that it\ncertainly would have lasted forever, but for the excessive\nintellectual vivacity of Democritus, Archimedes, Galileo, Berkeley,\nand other excentric geniuses whom the example of such men inflamed.\nRetain, I pray you, this suspicion about common sense.",
        "The other point is this. Ought not the existence of the various\ntypes of thinking which we have reviewed, each so splendid for\ncertain purposes, yet all conflicting still, and neither one of them\nable to support a claim of absolute veracity, to awaken a\npresumption favorable to the pragmatistic view that all our theories\nare INSTRUMENTAL, are mental modes of ADAPTATION to reality, rather\nthan revelations or gnostic answers to some divinely instituted\nworld-enigma? I expressed this view as clearly as I could in the\nsecond of these lectures. Certainly the restlessness of the actual\ntheoretic situation, the value for some purposes of each thought-\nlevel, and the inability of either to expel the others decisively,\nsuggest this pragmatistic view, which I hope that the next lectures\nmay soon make entirely convincing. May there not after all be a\npossible ambiguity in truth?",
        "When Clerk Maxwell was a child it is written that he had a mania for\nhaving everything explained to him, and that when people put him off\nwith vague verbal accounts of any phenomenon he would interrupt them\nimpatiently by saying, “Yes; but I want you to tell me the\nPARTICULAR GO of it!” Had his question been about truth, only a\npragmatist could have told him the particular go of it. I believe\nthat our contemporary pragmatists, especially Messrs. Schiller and\nDewey, have given the only tenable account of this subject. It is a\nvery ticklish subject, sending subtle rootlets into all kinds of\ncrannies, and hard to treat in the sketchy way that alone befits a\npublic lecture. But the Schiller-Dewey view of truth has been so\nferociously attacked by rationalistic philosophers, and so\nabominably misunderstood, that here, if anywhere, is the point where\na clear and simple statement should be made.",
        "I fully expect to see the pragmatist view of truth run through the\nclassic stages of a theory’s career. First, you know, a new theory\nis attacked as absurd; then it is admitted to be true, but obvious\nand insignificant; finally it is seen to be so important that its\nadversaries claim that they themselves discovered it. Our doctrine\nof truth is at present in the first of these three stages, with\nsymptoms of the second stage having begun in certain quarters. I\nwish that this lecture might help it beyond the first stage in the\neyes of many of you.",
        "Truth, as any dictionary will tell you, is a property of certain of\nour ideas. It means their ’agreement,’ as falsity means their\ndisagreement, with ’reality.’ Pragmatists and intellectualists both\naccept this definition as a matter of course. They begin to quarrel\nonly after the question is raised as to what may precisely be meant\nby the term ’agreement,’ and what by the term ’reality,’ when\nreality is taken as something for our ideas to agree with.",
        "In answering these questions the pragmatists are more analytic and\npainstaking, the intellectualists more offhand and irreflective. The\npopular notion is that a true idea must copy its reality. Like other\npopular views, this one follows the analogy of the most usual\nexperience. Our true ideas of sensible things do indeed copy them.\nShut your eyes and think of yonder clock on the wall, and you get\njust such a true picture or copy of its dial. But your idea of its\n’works’ (unless you are a clock-maker) is much less of a copy, yet\nit passes muster, for it in no way clashes with the reality. Even\ntho it should shrink to the mere word ’works,’ that word still\nserves you truly; and when you speak of the ’time-keeping function’\nof the clock, or of its spring’s ’elasticity,’ it is hard to see\nexactly what your ideas can copy.",
        "You perceive that there is a problem here. Where our ideas cannot\ncopy definitely their object, what does agreement with that object\nmean? Some idealists seem to say that they are true whenever they\nare what God means that we ought to think about that object. Others\nhold the copy-view all through, and speak as if our ideas possessed\ntruth just in proportion as they approach to being copies of the\nAbsolute’s eternal way of thinking.",
        "These views, you see, invite pragmatistic discussion. But the great\nassumption of the intellectualists is that truth means essentially\nan inert static relation. When you’ve got your true idea of\nanything, there’s an end of the matter. You’re in possession; you\nKNOW; you have fulfilled your thinking destiny. You are where you\nought to be mentally; you have obeyed your categorical imperative;\nand nothing more need follow on that climax of your rational\ndestiny. Epistemologically you are in stable equilibrium.",
        "Pragmatism, on the other hand, asks its usual question. “Grant an\nidea or belief to be true,” it says, “what concrete difference will\nits being true make in anyone’s actual life? How will the truth be\nrealized? What experiences will be different from those which would\nobtain if the belief were false? What, in short, is the truth’s\ncash-value in experiential terms?”",
        "The moment pragmatism asks this question, it sees the answer: TRUE\nIDEAS ARE THOSE THAT WE CAN ASSIMILATE, VALIDATE, CORROBORATE AND\nVERIFY. FALSE IDEAS ARE THOSE THAT WE CANNOT. That is the practical\ndifference it makes to us to have true ideas; that, therefore, is\nthe meaning of truth, for it is all that truth is known-as.",
        "This thesis is what I have to defend. The truth of an idea is not a\nstagnant property inherent in it. Truth HAPPENS to an idea. It\nBECOMES true, is MADE true by events. Its verity is in fact an\nevent, a process: the process namely of its verifying itself, its\nveri-FICATION. Its validity is the process of its valid-ATION.",
        "But what do the words verification and validation themselves\npragmatically mean? They again signify certain practical\nconsequences of the verified and validated idea. It is hard to find\nany one phrase that characterizes these consequences better than the\nordinary agreement-formula–just such consequences being what we\nhave in mind whenever we say that our ideas ’agree’ with reality.\nThey lead us, namely, through the acts and other ideas which they\ninstigate, into or up to, or towards, other parts of experience with\nwhich we feel all the while-such feeling being among our\npotentialities–that the original ideas remain in agreement. The\nconnexions and transitions come to us from point to point as being\nprogressive, harmonious, satisfactory. This function of agreeable\nleading is what we mean by an idea’s verification. Such an account\nis vague and it sounds at first quite trivial, but it has results\nwhich it will take the rest of my hour to explain.",
        "Let me begin by reminding you of the fact that the possession of\ntrue thoughts means everywhere the possession of invaluable\ninstruments of action; and that our duty to gain truth, so far from\nbeing a blank command from out of the blue, or a ’stunt’ self-\nimposed by our intellect, can account for itself by excellent\npractical reasons.",
        "The importance to human life of having true beliefs about matters of\nfact is a thing too notorious. We live in a world of realities that\ncan be infinitely useful or infinitely harmful. Ideas that tell us\nwhich of them to expect count as the true ideas in all this primary\nsphere of verification, and the pursuit of such ideas is a primary\nhuman duty. The possession of truth, so far from being here an end\nin itself, is only a preliminary means towards other vital\nsatisfactions. If I am lost in the woods and starved, and find what\nlooks like a cow-path, it is of the utmost importance that I should\nthink of a human habitation at the end of it, for if I do so and\nfollow it, I save myself. The true thought is useful here because\nthe house which is its object is useful. The practical value of true\nideas is thus primarily derived from the practical importance of\ntheir objects to us. Their objects are, indeed, not important at all\ntimes. I may on another occasion have no use for the house; and then\nmy idea of it, however verifiable, will be practically irrelevant,\nand had better remain latent. Yet since almost any object may some\nday become temporarily important, the advantage of having a general\nstock of extra truths, of ideas that shall be true of merely\npossible situations, is obvious. We store such extra truths away in\nour memories, and with the overflow we fill our books of reference.\nWhenever such an extra truth becomes practically relevant to one of\nour emergencies, it passes from cold-storage to do work in the\nworld, and our belief in it grows active. You can say of it then\neither that ’it is useful because it is true’ or that ’it is true\nbecause it is useful.’ Both these phrases mean exactly the same\nthing, namely that here is an idea that gets fulfilled and can be\nverified. True is the name for whatever idea starts the\nverification-process, useful is the name for its completed function\nin experience. True ideas would never have been singled out as such,\nwould never have acquired a class-name, least of all a name\nsuggesting value, unless they had been useful from the outset in\nthis way.",
        "From this simple cue pragmatism gets her general notion of truth as\nsomething essentially bound up with the way in which one moment in\nour experience may lead us towards other moments which it will be\nworth while to have been led to. Primarily, and on the common-sense\nlevel, the truth of a state of mind means this function of A LEADING\nTHAT IS WORTH WHILE. When a moment in our experience, of any kind\nwhatever, inspires us with a thought that is true, that means that\nsooner or later we dip by that thought’s guidance into the\nparticulars of experience again and make advantageous connexion with\nthem. This is a vague enough statement, but I beg you to retain it,\nfor it is essential.",
        "Our experience meanwhile is all shot through with regularities. One\nbit of it can warn us to get ready for another bit, can ’intend’ or\nbe ’significant of’ that remoter object. The object’s advent is the\nsignificance’s verification. Truth, in these cases, meaning nothing\nbut eventual verification, is manifestly incompatible with\nwaywardness on our part. Woe to him whose beliefs play fast and\nloose with the order which realities follow in his experience: they\nwill lead him nowhere or else make false connexions.",
        "By ’realities’ or ’objects’ here, we mean either things of common\nsense, sensibly present, or else common-sense relations, such as\ndates, places, distances, kinds, activities. Following our mental\nimage of a house along the cow-path, we actually come to see the\nhouse; we get the image’s full verification. SUCH SIMPLY AND FULLY\nVERIFIED LEADINGS ARE CERTAINLY THE ORIGINALS AND PROTOTYPES OF THE\nTRUTH-PROCESS. Experience offers indeed other forms of truth-\nprocess, but they are all conceivable as being primary verifications\narrested, multiplied or substituted one for another.",
        "Take, for instance, yonder object on the wall. You and I consider it\nto be a ’clock,’ altho no one of us has seen the hidden works that\nmake it one. We let our notion pass for true without attempting to\nverify. If truths mean verification-process essentially, ought we\nthen to call such unverified truths as this abortive? No, for they\nform the overwhelmingly large number of the truths we live by.\nIndirect as well as direct verifications pass muster. Where\ncircumstantial evidence is sufficient, we can go without eye-\nwitnessing. Just as we here assume Japan to exist without ever\nhaving been there, because it WORKS to do so, everything we know\nconspiring with the belief, and nothing interfering, so we assume\nthat thing to be a clock. We USE it as a clock, regulating the\nlength of our lecture by it. The verification of the assumption here\nmeans its leading to no frustration or contradiction. VerifiABILITY\nof wheels and weights and pendulum is as good as verification. For\none truth-process completed there are a million in our lives that\nfunction in this state of nascency. They turn us TOWARDS direct\nverification; lead us into the SURROUNDINGS of the objects they\nenvisage; and then, if everything runs on harmoniously, we are so\nsure that verification is possible that we omit it, and are usually\njustified by all that happens.",
        "Truth lives, in fact, for the most part on a credit system. Our\nthoughts and beliefs ’pass,’ so long as nothing challenges them,\njust as bank-notes pass so long as nobody refuses them. But this all\npoints to direct face-to-face verifications somewhere, without which\nthe fabric of truth collapses like a financial system with no cash-\nbasis whatever. You accept my verification of one thing, I yours of\nanother. We trade on each other’s truth. But beliefs verified\nconcretely by SOMEBODY are the posts of the whole superstructure.",
        "Another great reason–beside economy of time–for waiving complete\nverification in the usual business of life is that all things exist\nin kinds and not singly. Our world is found once for all to have\nthat peculiarity. So that when we have once directly verified our\nideas about one specimen of a kind, we consider ourselves free to\napply them to other specimens without verification. A mind that\nhabitually discerns the kind of thing before it, and acts by the law\nof the kind immediately, without pausing to verify, will be a ’true’\nmind in ninety-nine out of a hundred emergencies, proved so by its\nconduct fitting everything it meets, and getting no refutation.",
        "INDIRECTLY OR ONLY POTENTIALLY VERIFYING PROCESSES MAY THUS BE TRUE\nAS WELL AS FULL VERIFICATION-PROCESSES. They work as true processes\nwould work, give us the same advantages, and claim our recognition\nfor the same reasons. All this on the common-sense level of, matters\nof fact, which we are alone considering.",
        "But matters of fact are not our only stock in trade. RELATIONS AMONG\nPURELY MENTAL IDEAS form another sphere where true and false beliefs\nobtain, and here the beliefs are absolute, or unconditional. When\nthey are true they bear the name either of definitions or of\nprinciples. It is either a principle or a definition that 1 and 1\nmake 2, that 2 and 1 make 3, and so on; that white differs less from\ngray than it does from black; that when the cause begins to act the\neffect also commences. Such propositions hold of all possible\n’ones,’ of all conceivable ’whites’ and ’grays’ and ’causes.’ The\nobjects here are mental objects. Their relations are perceptually\nobvious at a glance, and no sense-verification is necessary.\nMoreover, once true, always true, of those same mental objects.\nTruth here has an ’eternal’ character. If you can find a concrete\nthing anywhere that is ’one’ or ’white’ or ’gray,’ or an ’effect,’\nthen your principles will everlastingly apply to it. It is but a\ncase of ascertaining the kind, and then applying the law of its kind\nto the particular object. You are sure to get truth if you can but\nname the kind rightly, for your mental relations hold good of\neverything of that kind without exception. If you then,\nnevertheless, failed to get truth concretely, you would say that you\nhad classed your real objects wrongly.",
        "In this realm of mental relations, truth again is an affair of\nleading. We relate one abstract idea with another, framing in the\nend great systems of logical and mathematical truth, under the\nrespective terms of which the sensible facts of experience\neventually arrange themselves, so that our eternal truths hold good\nof realities also. This marriage of fact and theory is endlessly\nfertile. What we say is here already true in advance of special\nverification, IF WE HAVE SUBSUMED OUR OBJECTS RIGHTLY. Our ready-\nmade ideal framework for all sorts of possible objects follows from\nthe very structure of our thinking. We can no more play fast and\nloose with these abstract relations than we can do so with our\nsense-experiences. They coerce us; we must treat them consistently,\nwhether or not we like the results. The rules of addition apply to\nour debts as rigorously as to our assets. The hundredth decimal of\npi, the ratio of the circumference to its diameter, is predetermined\nideally now, tho no one may have computed it. If we should ever need\nthe figure in our dealings with an actual circle we should need to\nhave it given rightly, calculated by the usual rules; for it is the\nsame kind of truth that those rules elsewhere calculate.",
        "Between the coercions of the sensible order and those of the ideal\norder, our mind is thus wedged tightly. Our ideas must agree with\nrealities, be such realities concrete or abstract, be they facts or\nbe they principles, under penalty of endless inconsistency and\nfrustration. So far, intellectualists can raise no protest. They can\nonly say that we have barely touched the skin of the matter.",
        "Realities mean, then, either concrete facts, or abstract kinds of\nthings and relations perceived intuitively between them. They\nfurthermore and thirdly mean, as things that new ideas of ours must\nno less take account of, the whole body of other truths already in\nour possession. But what now does ’agreement’ with such three-fold\nrealities mean?–to use again the definition that is current.",
        "Here it is that pragmatism and intellectualism begin to part\ncompany. Primarily, no doubt, to agree means to copy, but we saw\nthat the mere word ’clock’ would do instead of a mental picture of\nits works, and that of many realities our ideas can only be symbols\nand not copies. ’Past time,’ ’power,’ ’spontaneity’–how can our\nmind copy such realities?",
        "To ’agree’ in the widest sense with a reality, CAN ONLY MEAN TO BE\nGUIDED EITHER STRAIGHT UP TO IT OR INTO ITS SURROUNDINGS, OR TO BE\nPUT INTO SUCH WORKING TOUCH WITH IT AS TO HANDLE EITHER IT OR\nSOMETHING CONNECTED WITH IT BETTER THAN IF WE DISAGREED. Better\neither intellectually or practically! And often agreement will only\nmean the negative fact that nothing contradictory from the quarter\nof that reality comes to interfere with the way in which our ideas\nguide us elsewhere. To copy a reality is, indeed, one very important\nway of agreeing with it, but it is far from being essential. The\nessential thing is the process of being guided. Any idea that helps\nus to DEAL, whether practically or intellectually, with either the\nreality or its belongings, that doesn’t entangle our progress in\nfrustrations, that FITS, in fact, and adapts our life to the\nreality’s whole setting, will agree sufficiently to meet the\nrequirement. It will hold true of that reality.",
        "Thus, NAMES are just as ’true’ or ’false’ as definite mental\npictures are. They set up similar verification-processes, and lead\nto fully equivalent practical results.",
        "All human thinking gets discursified; we exchange ideas; we lend and\nborrow verifications, get them from one another by means of social\nintercourse. All truth thus gets verbally built out, stored up, and\nmade available for everyone. Hence, we must TALK consistently just\nas we must THINK consistently: for both in talk and thought we deal\nwith kinds. Names are arbitrary, but once understood they must be\nkept to. We mustn’t now call Abel ’Cain’ or Cain ’Abel.’ If we do,\nwe ungear ourselves from the whole book of Genesis, and from all its\nconnexions with the universe of speech and fact down to the present\ntime. We throw ourselves out of whatever truth that entire system of\nspeech and fact may embody.",
        "The overwhelming majority of our true ideas admit of no direct or\nface-to-face verification-those of past history, for example, as of\nCain and Abel. The stream of time can be remounted only verbally, or\nverified indirectly by the present prolongations or effects of what\nthe past harbored. Yet if they agree with these verbalities and\neffects, we can know that our ideas of the past are true. AS TRUE AS\nPAST TIME ITSELF WAS, so true was Julius Caesar, so true were\nantediluvian monsters, all in their proper dates and settings. That\npast time itself was, is guaranteed by its coherence with everything\nthat’s present. True as the present is, the past was also.",
        "Agreement thus turns out to be essentially an affair of leading–\nleading that is useful because it is into quarters that contain\nobjects that are important. True ideas lead us into useful verbal\nand conceptual quarters as well as directly up to useful sensible\ntermini. They lead to consistency, stability and flowing human\nintercourse. They lead away from excentricity and isolation, from\nfoiled and barren thinking. The untrammeled flowing of the leading-\nprocess, its general freedom from clash and contradiction, passes\nfor its indirect verification; but all roads lead to Rome, and in\nthe end and eventually, all true processes must lead to the face of\ndirectly verifying sensible experiences SOMEWHERE, which somebody’s\nideas have copied.",
        "Such is the large loose way in which the pragmatist interprets the\nword agreement. He treats it altogether practically. He lets it\ncover any process of conduction from a present idea to a future\nterminus, provided only it run prosperously. It is only thus that\n’scientific’ ideas, flying as they do beyond common sense, can be\nsaid to agree with their realities. It is, as I have already said,\nas if reality were made of ether, atoms or electrons, but we mustn’t\nthink so literally. The term ’energy’ doesn’t even pretend to stand\nfor anything ’objective.’ It is only a way of measuring the surface\nof phenomena so as to string their changes on a simple formula.",
        "Yet in the choice of these man-made formulas we cannot be capricious\nwith impunity any more than we can be capricious on the common-sense\npractical level. We must find a theory that will WORK; and that\nmeans something extremely difficult; for our theory must mediate\nbetween all previous truths and certain new experiences. It must\nderange common sense and previous belief as little as possible, and\nit must lead to some sensible terminus or other that can be verified\nexactly. To ’work’ means both these things; and the squeeze is so\ntight that there is little loose play for any hypothesis. Our\ntheories are wedged and controlled as nothing else is. Yet sometimes\nalternative theoretic formulas are equally compatible with all the\ntruths we know, and then we choose between them for subjective\nreasons. We choose the kind of theory to which we are already\npartial; we follow ’elegance’ or ’economy.’ Clerk Maxwell somewhere\nsays it would be “poor scientific taste” to choose the more\ncomplicated of two equally well-evidenced conceptions; and you will\nall agree with him. Truth in science is what gives us the maximum\npossible sum of satisfactions, taste included, but consistency both\nwith previous truth and with novel fact is always the most imperious\nclaimant.",
        "I have led you through a very sandy desert. But now, if I may be\nallowed so vulgar an expression, we begin to taste the milk in the\ncocoanut. Our rationalist critics here discharge their batteries\nupon us, and to reply to them will take us out from all this dryness\ninto full sight of a momentous philosophical alternative.",
        "Our account of truth is an account of truths in the plural, of\nprocesses of leading, realized in rebus, and having only this\nquality in common, that they PAY. They pay by guiding us into or\ntowards some part of a system that dips at numerous points into\nsense-percepts, which we may copy mentally or not, but with which at\nany rate we are now in the kind of commerce vaguely designated as\nverification. Truth for us is simply a collective name for\nverification-processes, just as health, wealth, strength, etc., are\nnames for other processes connected with life, and also pursued\nbecause it pays to pursue them. Truth is MADE, just as health,\nwealth and strength are made, in the course of experience.",
        "Here rationalism is instantaneously up in arms against us. I can\nimagine a rationalist to talk as follows:",
        "“Truth is not made,” he will say; “it absolutely obtains, being a\nunique relation that does not wait upon any process, but shoots\nstraight over the head of experience, and hits its reality every\ntime. Our belief that yon thing on the wall is a clock is true\nalready, altho no one in the whole history of the world should\nverify it. The bare quality of standing in that transcendent\nrelation is what makes any thought true that possesses it, whether\nor not there be verification. You pragmatists put the cart before\nthe horse in making truth’s being reside in verification-processes.\nThese are merely signs of its being, merely our lame ways of\nascertaining after the fact, which of our ideas already has\npossessed the wondrous quality. The quality itself is timeless, like\nall essences and natures. Thoughts partake of it directly, as they\npartake of falsity or of irrelevancy. It can’t be analyzed away into\npragmatic consequences.”",
        "The whole plausibility of this rationalist tirade is due to the fact\nto which we have already paid so much attention. In our world,\nnamely, abounding as it does in things of similar kinds and\nsimilarly associated, one verification serves for others of its\nkind, and one great use of knowing things is to be led not so much\nto them as to their associates, especially to human talk about them.\nThe quality of truth, obtaining ante rem, pragmatically means, then,\nthe fact that in such a world innumerable ideas work better by their\nindirect or possible than by their direct and actual verification.\nTruth ante rem means only verifiability, then; or else it is a case\nof the stock rationalist trick of treating the NAME of a concrete\nphenomenal reality as an independent prior entity, and placing it\nbehind the reality as its explanation. Professor Mach quotes\nsomewhere an epigram of Lessing’s:",
        "Sagt Hanschen Schlau zu Vetter Fritz,\n\"Wie kommt es, Vetter Fritzen,\nDass grad’ die Reichsten in der Welt,\nDas meiste Geld besitzen?”",
        "Hanschen Schlau here treats the principle ’wealth’ as something\ndistinct from the facts denoted by the man’s being rich. It\nantedates them; the facts become only a sort of secondary\ncoincidence with the rich man’s essential nature.",
        "In the case of ’wealth’ we all see the fallacy. We know that wealth\nis but a name for concrete processes that certain men’s lives play a\npart in, and not a natural excellence found in Messrs. Rockefeller\nand Carnegie, but not in the rest of us.",
        "Like wealth, health also lives in rebus. It is a name for processes,\nas digestion, circulation, sleep, etc., that go on happily, tho in\nthis instance we are more inclined to think of it as a principle and\nto say the man digests and sleeps so well BECAUSE he is so healthy.",
        "With ’strength’ we are, I think, more rationalistic still, and\ndecidedly inclined to treat it as an excellence pre-existing in the\nman and explanatory of the herculean performances of his muscles.",
        "With ’truth’ most people go over the border entirely, and treat the\nrationalistic account as self-evident. But really all these words in\nTH are exactly similar. Truth exists ante rem just as much and as\nlittle as the other things do.",
        "The scholastics, following Aristotle, made much of the distinction\nbetween habit and act. Health in actu means, among other things,\ngood sleeping and digesting. But a healthy man need not always be\nsleeping, or always digesting, any more than a wealthy man need be\nalways handling money, or a strong man always lifting weights. All\nsuch qualities sink to the status of ’habits’ between their times of\nexercise; and similarly truth becomes a habit of certain of our\nideas and beliefs in their intervals of rest from their verifying\nactivities. But those activities are the root of the whole matter,\nand the condition of there being any habit to exist in the\nintervals.",
        "’The true,’ to put it very briefly, is only the expedient in the way\nof our thinking, just as ’the right’ is only the expedient in the\nway of our behaving. Expedient in almost any fashion; and expedient\nin the long run and on the whole of course; for what meets\nexpediently all the experience in sight won’t necessarily meet all\nfarther experiences equally satisfactorily. Experience, as we know,\nhas ways of BOILING OVER, and making us correct our present\nformulas.",
        "The ’absolutely’ true, meaning what no farther experience will ever\nalter, is that ideal vanishing-point towards which we imagine that\nall our temporary truths will some day converge. It runs on all\nfours with the perfectly wise man, and with the absolutely complete\nexperience; and, if these ideals are ever realized, they will all be\nrealized together. Meanwhile we have to live to-day by what truth we\ncan get to-day, and be ready to-morrow to call it falsehood.\nPtolemaic astronomy, euclidean space, aristotelian logic, scholastic\nmetaphysics, were expedient for centuries, but human experience has\nboiled over those limits, and we now call these things only\nrelatively true, or true within those borders of experience.\n’Absolutely’ they are false; for we know that those limits were\ncasual, and might have been transcended by past theorists just as\nthey are by present thinkers.",
        "When new experiences lead to retrospective judgments, using the past\ntense, what these judgments utter WAS true, even tho no past thinker\nhad been led there. We live forwards, a Danish thinker has said, but\nwe understand backwards. The present sheds a backward light on the\nworld’s previous processes. They may have been truth-processes for\nthe actors in them. They are not so for one who knows the later\nrevelations of the story.",
        "This regulative notion of a potential better truth to be established\nlater, possibly to be established some day absolutely, and having\npowers of retroactive legislation, turns its face, like all\npragmatist notions, towards concreteness of fact, and towards the\nfuture. Like the half-truths, the absolute truth will have to be\nMADE, made as a relation incidental to the growth of a mass of\nverification-experience, to which the half-true ideas are all along\ncontributing their quota.",
        "I have already insisted on the fact that truth is made largely out\nof previous truths. Men’s beliefs at any time are so much experience\nfunded. But the beliefs are themselves parts of the sum total of the\nworld’s experience, and become matter, therefore, for the next day’s\nfunding operations. So far as reality means experienceable reality,\nboth it and the truths men gain about it are everlastingly in\nprocess of mutation-mutation towards a definite goal, it may be–but\nstill mutation.",
        "Mathematicians can solve problems with two variables. On the\nNewtonian theory, for instance, acceleration varies with distance,\nbut distance also varies with acceleration. In the realm of truth-\nprocesses facts come independently and determine our beliefs\nprovisionally. But these beliefs make us act, and as fast as they do\nso, they bring into sight or into existence new facts which re-\ndetermine the beliefs accordingly. So the whole coil and ball of\ntruth, as it rolls up, is the product of a double influence. Truths\nemerge from facts; but they dip forward into facts again and add to\nthem; which facts again create or reveal new truth (the word is\nindifferent) and so on indefinitely. The ’facts’ themselves\nmeanwhile are not TRUE. They simply ARE. Truth is the function of\nthe beliefs that start and terminate among them.",
        "The case is like a snowball’s growth, due as it is to the\ndistribution of the snow on the one hand, and to the successive\npushes of the boys on the other, with these factors co-determining\neach other incessantly.",
        "The most fateful point of difference between being a rationalist and\nbeing a pragmatist is now fully in sight. Experience is in mutation,\nand our psychological ascertainments of truth are in mutation–so\nmuch rationalism will allow; but never that either reality itself or\ntruth itself is mutable. Reality stands complete and ready-made from\nall eternity, rationalism insists, and the agreement of our ideas\nwith it is that unique unanalyzable virtue in them of which she has\nalready told us. As that intrinsic excellence, their truth has\nnothing to do with our experiences. It adds nothing to the content\nof experience. It makes no difference to reality itself; it is\nsupervenient, inert, static, a reflexion merely. It doesn’t EXIST,\nit HOLDS or OBTAINS, it belongs to another dimension from that of\neither facts or fact-relations, belongs, in short, to the\nepistemological dimension–and with that big word rationalism closes\nthe discussion.",
        "Thus, just as pragmatism faces forward to the future, so does\nrationalism here again face backward to a past eternity. True to her\ninveterate habit, rationalism reverts to ’principles,’ and thinks\nthat when an abstraction once is named, we own an oracular solution.",
        "The tremendous pregnancy in the way of consequences for life of this\nradical difference of outlook will only become apparent in my later\nlectures. I wish meanwhile to close this lecture by showing that\nrationalism’s sublimity does not save it from inanity.",
        "When, namely, you ask rationalists, instead of accusing pragmatism\nof desecrating the notion of truth, to define it themselves by\nsaying exactly what THEY understand by it, the only positive\nattempts I can think of are these two:",
        "1. “Truth is just the system of propositions which have an un-\nconditional claim to be recognized as valid.” [Footnote: A. E.\nTaylor, Philosophical Review, vol. xiv, p. 288.]",
        "2. Truth is a name for all those judgments which we find ourselves\nunder obligation to make by a kind of imperative duty. [Footnote: H.\nRickert, Der Gegenstand der Erkenntniss, chapter on ’Die\nUrtheilsnothwendigkeit.’]",
        "The first thing that strikes one in such definitions is their\nunutterable triviality. They are absolutely true, of course, but\nabsolutely insignificant until you handle them pragmatically. What\ndo you mean by ’claim’ here, and what do you mean by ’duty’? As\nsummary names for the concrete reasons why thinking in true ways is\noverwhelmingly expedient and good for mortal men, it is all right to\ntalk of claims on reality’s part to be agreed with, and of\nobligations on our part to agree. We feel both the claims and the\nobligations, and we feel them for just those reasons.",
        "But the rationalists who talk of claim and obligation EXPRESSLY SAY\nTHAT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR PRACTICAL INTERESTS OR\nPERSONAL REASONS. Our reasons for agreeing are psychological facts,\nthey say, relative to each thinker, and to the accidents of his\nlife. They are his evidence merely, they are no part of the life of\ntruth itself. That life transacts itself in a purely logical or\nepistemological, as distinguished from a psychological, dimension,\nand its claims antedate and exceed all personal motivations\nwhatsoever. Tho neither man nor God should ever ascertain truth, the\nword would still have to be defined as that which OUGHT to be\nascertained and recognized.",
        "There never was a more exquisite example of an idea abstracted from\nthe concretes of experience and then used to oppose and negate what\nit was abstracted from.",
        "Philosophy and common life abound in similar instances. The\n’sentimentalist fallacy’ is to shed tears over abstract justice and\ngenerosity, beauty, etc., and never to know these qualities when you\nmeet them in the street, because there the circumstances make them\nvulgar. Thus I read in the privately printed biography of an\neminently rationalistic mind: “It was strange that with such\nadmiration for beauty in the abstract, my brother had no enthusiasm\nfor fine architecture, for beautiful painting, or for flowers.” And\nin almost the last philosophic work I have read, I find such\npassages as the following: “Justice is ideal, solely ideal. Reason\nconceives that it ought to exist, but experience shows that it can-\nnot. ... Truth, which ought to be, cannot be. ... Reason is deformed\nby experience. As soon as reason enters experience, it becomes\ncontrary to reason.”",
        "The rationalist’s fallacy here is exactly like the sentimentalist’s.\nBoth extract a quality from the muddy particulars of experience, and\nfind it so pure when extracted that they contrast it with each and\nall its muddy instances as an opposite and higher nature. All the\nwhile it is THEIR nature. It is the nature of truths to be\nvalidated, verified. It pays for our ideas to be validated. Our\nobligation to seek truth is part of our general obligation to do\nwhat pays. The payments true ideas bring are the sole why of our\nduty to follow them.",
        "Identical whys exist in the case of wealth and health. Truth makes\nno other kind of claim and imposes no other kind of ought than\nhealth and wealth do. All these claims are conditional; the concrete\nbenefits we gain are what we mean by calling the pursuit a duty. In\nthe case of truth, untrue beliefs work as perniciously in the long\nrun as true beliefs work beneficially. Talking abstractly, the\nquality ’true’ may thus be said to grow absolutely precious, and the\nquality ’untrue’ absolutely damnable: the one may be called good,\nthe other bad, unconditionally. We ought to think the true, we ought\nto shun the false, imperatively.",
        "But if we treat all this abstraction literally and oppose it to its\nmother soil in experience, see what a preposterous position we work\nourselves into.",
        "We cannot then take a step forward in our actual thinking. When\nshall I acknowledge this truth and when that? Shall the\nacknowledgment be loud?–or silent? If sometimes loud, sometimes\nsilent, which NOW? When may a truth go into cold-storage in the\nencyclopedia? and when shall it come out for battle? Must I\nconstantly be repeating the truth ’twice two are four’ because of\nits eternal claim on recognition? or is it sometimes irrelevant?\nMust my thoughts dwell night and day on my personal sins and\nblemishes, because I truly have them?–or may I sink and ignore them\nin order to be a decent social unit, and not a mass of morbid\nmelancholy and apology?",
        "It is quite evident that our obligation to acknowledge truth, so far\nfrom being unconditional, is tremendously conditioned. Truth with a\nbig T, and in the singular, claims abstractly to be recognized, of\ncourse; but concrete truths in the plural need be recognized only\nwhen their recognition is expedient. A truth must always be\npreferred to a falsehood when both relate to the situation; but when\nneither does, truth is as little of a duty as falsehood. If you ask\nme what o’clock it is and I tell you that I live at 95 Irving\nStreet, my answer may indeed be true, but you don’t see why it is my\nduty to give it. A false address would be as much to the purpose.",
        "With this admission that there are conditions that limit the\napplication of the abstract imperative, THE PRAGMATISTIC TREATMENT\nOF TRUTH SWEEPS BACK UPON US IN ITS FULNESS. Our duty to agree with\nreality is seen to be grounded in a perfect jungle of concrete\nexpediencies.",
        "When Berkeley had explained what people meant by matter, people\nthought that he denied matter’s existence. When Messrs. Schiller and\nDewey now explain what people mean by truth, they are accused of\ndenying ITS existence. These pragmatists destroy all objective\nstandards, critics say, and put foolishness and wisdom on one level.\nA favorite formula for describing Mr. Schiller’s doctrines and mine\nis that we are persons who think that by saying whatever you find it\npleasant to say and calling it truth you fulfil every pragmatistic\nrequirement.",
        "I leave it to you to judge whether this be not an impudent slander.\nPent in, as the pragmatist more than anyone else sees himself to be,\nbetween the whole body of funded truths squeezed from the past and\nthe coercions of the world of sense about him, who so well as he\nfeels the immense pressure of objective control under which our\nminds perform their operations? If anyone imagines that this law is\nlax, let him keep its commandment one day, says Emerson. We have\nheard much of late of the uses of the imagination in science. It is\nhigh time to urge the use of a little imagination in philosophy. The\nunwillingness of some of our critics to read any but the silliest of\npossible meanings into our statements is as discreditable to their\nimaginations as anything I know in recent philosophic history.\nSchiller says the true is that which ’works.’ Thereupon he is\ntreated as one who limits verification to the lowest material\nutilities. Dewey says truth is what gives ’satisfaction.’ He is\ntreated as one who believes in calling everything true which, if it\nwere true, would be pleasant.",
        "Our critics certainly need more imagination of realities. I have\nhonestly tried to stretch my own imagination and to read the best\npossible meaning into the rationalist conception, but I have to\nconfess that it still completely baffles me. The notion of a reality\ncalling on us to ’agree’ with it, and that for no reasons, but\nsimply because its claim is ’unconditional’ or ’transcendent,’ is\none that I can make neither head nor tail of. I try to imagine\nmyself as the sole reality in the world, and then to imagine what\nmore I would ’claim’ if I were allowed to. If you suggest the\npossibility of my claiming that a mind should come into being from\nout of the void inane and stand and COPY me, I can indeed imagine\nwhat the copying might mean, but I can conjure up no motive. What\ngood it would do me to be copied, or what good it would do that mind\nto copy me, if farther consequences are expressly and in principle\nruled out as motives for the claim (as they are by our rationalist\nauthorities) I cannot fathom. When the Irishman’s admirers ran him\nalong to the place of banquet in a sedan chair with no bottom, he\nsaid, “Faith, if it wasn’t for the honor of the thing, I might as\nwell have come on foot.” So here: but for the honor of the thing, I\nmight as well have remained uncopied. Copying is one genuine mode of\nknowing (which for some strange reason our contemporary\ntranscendentalists seem to be tumbling over each other to\nrepudiate); but when we get beyond copying, and fall back on unnamed\nforms of agreeing that are expressly denied to be either copyings or\nleadings or fittings, or any other processes pragmatically\ndefinable, the WHAT of the ’agreement’ claimed becomes as\nunintelligible as the why of it. Neither content nor motive can be\nimagine for it. It is an absolutely meaningless abstraction.\n[Footnote: I am not forgetting that Professor Rickert long ago gave\nup the whole notion of truth being founded on agreement with\nreality. Reality, according to him, is whatever agrees with truth,\nand truth is founded solely on our primal duty. This fantastic\nflight, together with Mr. Joachim’s candid confession of failure in\nhis book The Nature of Truth, seems to me to mark the bankruptcy of\nrationalism when dealing with this subject. Rickert deals with part\nof the pragmatistic position under the head of what he calls\n’Relativismus.’ I cannot discuss his text here. Suffice it to say\nthat his argumentation in that chapter is so feeble as to seem\nalmost incredible in so generally able a writer.]",
        "Surely in this field of truth it is the pragmatists and not the\nrationalists who are the more genuine defenders of the universe’s\nrationality.",
        "What hardens the heart of everyone I approach with the view of truth\nsketched in my last lecture is that typical idol of the tribe, the\nnotion of THE Truth, conceived as the one answer, determinate and\ncomplete, to the one fixed enigma which the world is believed to\npropound. For popular tradition, it is all the better if the answer\nbe oracular, so as itself to awaken wonder as an enigma of the\nsecond order, veiling rather than revealing what its profundities\nare supposed to contain. All the great single-word answers to the\nworld’s riddle, such as God, the One, Reason, Law, Spirit, Matter,\nNature, Polarity, the Dialectic Process, the Idea, the Self, the\nOversoul, draw the admiration that men have lavished on them from\nthis oracular role. By amateurs in philosophy and professionals\nalike, the universe is represented as a queer sort of petrified\nsphinx whose appeal to man consists in a monotonous challenge to his\ndivining powers. THE Truth: what a perfect idol of the rationalistic\nmind! I read in an old letter–from a gifted friend who died too\nyoung–these words: “In everything, in science, art, morals and\nreligion, there MUST be one system that is right and EVERY other\nwrong.” How characteristic of the enthusiasm of a certain stage of\nyouth! At twenty-one we rise to such a challenge and expect to find\nthe system. It never occurs to most of us even later that the\nquestion ’what is THE truth?’ is no real question (being irrelative\nto all conditions) and that the whole notion of THE truth is an\nabstraction from the fact of truths in the plural, a mere useful\nsummarizing phrase like THE Latin Language or THE Law.",
        "Common-law judges sometimes talk about the law, and school-masters\ntalk about the latin tongue, in a way to make their hearers think\nthey mean entities pre-existent to the decisions or to the words and\nsyntax, determining them unequivocally and requiring them to obey.\nBut the slightest exercise of reflexion makes us see that, instead\nof being principles of this kind, both law and latin are results.\nDistinctions between the lawful and the unlawful in conduct, or\nbetween the correct and incorrect in speech, have grown up\nincidentally among the interactions of men’s experiences in detail;\nand in no other way do distinctions between the true and the false\nin belief ever grow up. Truth grafts itself on previous truth,\nmodifying it in the process, just as idiom grafts itself on previous\nidiom, and law on previous law. Given previous law and a novel case,\nand the judge will twist them into fresh law. Previous idiom; new\nslang or metaphor or oddity that hits the public taste:–and presto,\na new idiom is made. Previous truth; fresh facts:–and our mind\nfinds a new truth.",
        "All the while, however, we pretend that the eternal is unrolling,\nthat the one previous justice, grammar or truth is simply\nfulgurating, and not being made. But imagine a youth in the\ncourtroom trying cases with his abstract notion of ’the’ law, or a\ncensor of speech let loose among the theatres with his idea of ’the’\nmother-tongue, or a professor setting up to lecture on the actual\nuniverse with his rationalistic notion of ’the Truth’ with a big T,\nand what progress do they make? Truth, law, and language fairly boil\naway from them at the least touch of novel fact. These things MAKE\nTHEMSELVES as we go. Our rights, wrongs, prohibitions, penalties,\nwords, forms, idioms, beliefs, are so many new creations that add\nthemselves as fast as history proceeds. Far from being antecedent\nprinciples that animate the process, law, language, truth are but\nabstract names for its results.",
        "Laws and languages at any rate are thus seen to be man-made: things.\nMr. Schiller applies the analogy to beliefs, and proposes the name\nof ’Humanism’ for the doctrine that to an unascertainable extent our\ntruths are man-made products too. Human motives sharpen all our\nquestions, human satisfactions lurk in all our answers, all our\nformulas have a human twist. This element is so inextricable in the\nproducts that Mr. Schiller sometimes seems almost to leave it an\nopen question whether there be anything else. “The world,” he says,\n\"is essentially [u lambda nu], it is what we make of it. It is\nfruitless to define it by what it originally was or by what it is\napart from us; it IS what is made of it. Hence ... the world is\nPLASTIC.” [Footnote: Personal Idealism, p. 60.] He adds that we can\nlearn the limits of the plasticity only by trying, and that we ought\nto start as if it were wholly plastic, acting methodically on that\nassumption, and stopping only when we are decisively rebuked.",
        "This is Mr. Schiller’s butt-end-foremost statement of the humanist\nposition, and it has exposed him to severe attack. I mean to defend\nthe humanist position in this lecture, so I will insinuate a few\nremarks at this point.",
        "Mr. Schiller admits as emphatically as anyone the presence of\nresisting factors in every actual experience of truth-making, of\nwhich the new-made special truth must take account, and with which\nit has perforce to ’agree.’ All our truths are beliefs about\n’Reality’; and in any particular belief the reality acts as\nsomething independent, as a thing FOUND, not manufactured. Let me\nhere recall a bit of my last lecture.",
        "’REALITY’ IS IN GENERAL WHAT TRUTHS HAVE TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF;\n[Footnote: Mr. Taylor in his Elements of Metaphysics uses this\nexcellent pragmatic definition.] and the FIRST part of reality from\nthis point of view is the flux of our sensations. Sensations are\nforced upon us, coming we know not whence. Over their nature, order,\nand quantity we have as good as no control. THEY are neither true\nnor false; they simply ARE. It is only what we say about them, only\nthe names we give them, our theories of their source and nature and\nremote relations, that may be true or not.",
        "The SECOND part of reality, as something that our beliefs must also\nobediently take account of, is the RELATIONS that obtain between our\nsensations or between their copies in our minds. This part falls\ninto two sub-parts: 1) the relations that are mutable and\naccidental, as those of date and place; and 2) those that are fixed\nand essential because they are grounded on the inner natures of\ntheir terms–such as likeness and unlikeness. Both sorts of relation\nare matters of immediate perception. Both are ’facts.’ But it is the\nlatter kind of fact that forms the more important sub-part of\nreality for our theories of knowledge. Inner relations namely are\n’eternal,’ are perceived whenever their sensible terms are compared;\nand of them our thought–mathematical and logical thought, so-\ncalled–must eternally take account.",
        "The THIRD part of reality, additional to these perceptions (tho\nlargely based upon them), is the PREVIOUS TRUTHS of which every new\ninquiry takes account. This third part is a much less obdurately\nresisting factor: it often ends by giving way. In speaking of these\nthree portions of reality as at all times controlling our belief’s\nformation, I am only reminding you of what we heard in our last\nhour.",
        "Now however fixed these elements of reality may be, we still have a\ncertain freedom in our dealings with them. Take our sensations. THAT\nthey are is undoubtedly beyond our control; but WHICH we attend to,\nnote, and make emphatic in our conclusions depends on our own\ninterests; and, according as we lay the emphasis here or there,\nquite different formulations of truth result. We read the same facts\ndifferently. ’Waterloo,’ with the same fixed details, spells a\n’victory’ for an englishman; for a frenchman it spells a ’defeat.’\nSo, for an optimist philosopher the universe spells victory, for a\npessimist, defeat.",
        "What we say about reality thus depends on the perspective into which\nwe throw it. The THAT of it is its own; but the WHAT depends on the\nWHICH; and the which depends on US. Both the sensational and the\nrelational parts of reality are dumb: they say absolutely nothing\nabout themselves. We it is who have to speak for them. This dumbness\nof sensations has led such intellectualists as T.H. Green and Edward\nCaird to shove them almost beyond the pale of philosophic\nrecognition, but pragmatists refuse to go so far. A sensation is\nrather like a client who has given his case to a lawyer and then has\npassively to listen in the courtroom to whatever account of his\naffairs, pleasant or unpleasant, the lawyer finds it most expedient\nto give.",
        "Hence, even in the field of sensation, our minds exert a certain\narbitrary choice. By our inclusions and omissions we trace the\nfield’s extent; by our emphasis we mark its foreground and its\nbackground; by our order we read it in this direction or in that. We\nreceive in short the block of marble, but we carve the statue\nourselves.",
        "This applies to the ’eternal’ parts of reality as well: we shuffle\nour perceptions of intrinsic relation and arrange them just as\nfreely. We read them in one serial order or another, class them in\nthis way or in that, treat one or the other as more fundamental,\nuntil our beliefs about them form those bodies of truth known as\nlogics, geometries, or arithmetics, in each and all of which the\nform and order in which the whole is cast is flagrantly man-made.",
        "Thus, to say nothing of the new FACTS which men add to the matter of\nreality by the acts of their own lives, they have already impressed\ntheir mental forms on that whole third of reality which I have\ncalled ’previous truths.’ Every hour brings its new percepts, its\nown facts of sensation and relation, to be truly taken account of;\nbut the whole of our PAST dealings with such facts is already funded\nin the previous truths. It is therefore only the smallest and\nrecentest fraction of the first two parts of reality that comes to\nus without the human touch, and that fraction has immediately to\nbecome humanized in the sense of being squared, assimilated, or in\nsome way adapted, to the humanized mass already there. As a matter\nof fact we can hardly take in an impression at all, in the absence\nof a pre-conception of what impressions there may possibly be.",
        "When we talk of reality ’independent’ of human thinking, then, it\nseems a thing very hard to find. It reduces to the notion of what is\njust entering into experience, and yet to be named, or else to some\nimagined aboriginal presence in experience, before any belief about\nthe presence had arisen, before any human conception had been\napplied. It is what is absolutely dumb and evanescent, the merely\nideal limit of our minds. We may glimpse it, but we never grasp it;\nwhat we grasp is always some substitute for it which previous human\nthinking has peptonized and cooked for our consumption. If so vulgar\nan expression were allowed us, we might say that wherever we find\nit, it has been already FAKED. This is what Mr. Schiller has in mind\nwhen he calls independent reality a mere unresisting [u lambda nu],\nwhich IS only to be made over by us.",
        "That is Mr. Schiller’s belief about the sensible core of reality. We\n’encounter’ it (in Mr. Bradley’s words) but don’t possess it.\nSuperficially this sounds like Kant’s view; but between categories\nfulminated before nature began, and categories gradually forming\nthemselves in nature’s presence, the whole chasm between rationalism\nand empiricism yawns. To the genuine ’Kantianer’ Schiller will\nalways be to Kant as a satyr to Hyperion.",
        "Other pragmatists may reach more positive beliefs about the sensible\ncore of reality. They may think to get at it in its independent\nnature, by peeling off the successive man-made wrappings. They may\nmake theories that tell us where it comes from and all about it; and\nif these theories work satisfactorily they will be true. The\ntranscendental idealists say there is no core, the finally completed\nwrapping being reality and truth in one. Scholasticism still teaches\nthat the core is ’matter.’ Professor Bergson, Heymans, Strong, and\nothers, believe in the core and bravely try to define it. Messrs.\nDewey and Schiller treat it as a ’limit.’ Which is the truer of all\nthese diverse accounts, or of others comparable with them, unless it\nbe the one that finally proves the most satisfactory? On the one\nhand there will stand reality, on the other an account of it which\nproves impossible to better or to alter. If the impossibility prove\npermanent, the truth of the account will be absolute. Other content\nof truth than this I can find nowhere. If the anti-pragmatists have\nany other meaning, let them for heaven’s sake reveal it, let them\ngrant us access to it!",
        "Not BEING reality, but only our belief ABOUT reality, it will\ncontain human elements, but these will KNOW the non-human element,\nin the only sense in which there can be knowledge of anything. Does\nthe river make its banks, or do the banks make the river? Does a man\nwalk with his right leg or with his left leg more essentially? Just\nas impossible may it be to separate the real from the human factors\nin the growth of our cognitive experience.",
        "Let this stand as a first brief indication of the humanistic\nposition. Does it seem paradoxical? If so, I will try to make it\nplausible by a few illustrations, which will lead to a fuller\nacquaintance with the subject.",
        "In many familiar objects everyone will recognize the human element.\nWe conceive a given reality in this way or in that, to suit our\npurpose, and the reality passively submits to the conception. You\ncan take the number 27 as the cube of 3, or as the product of 3 and\n9, or as 26 PLUS 1, or 100 MINUS 73, or in countless other ways, of\nwhich one will be just as true as another. You can take a chessboard\nas black squares on a white ground, or as white squares on a black\nground, and neither conception is a false one. You can treat the\nadjoined figure [Figure of a ’Star of David’] as a star, as two big\ntriangles crossing each other, as a hexagon with legs set up on its\nangles, as six equal triangles hanging together by their tips, etc.\nAll these treatments are true treatments–the sensible THAT upon the\npaper resists no one of them. You can say of a line that it runs\neast, or you can say that it runs west, and the line per se accepts\nboth descriptions without rebelling at the inconsistency.",
        "We carve out groups of stars in the heavens, and call them\nconstellations, and the stars patiently suffer us to do so–tho if\nthey knew what we were doing, some of them might feel much surprised\nat the partners we had given them. We name the same constellation\ndiversely, as Charles’s Wain, the Great Bear, or the Dipper. None of\nthe names will be false, and one will be as true as another, for all\nare applicable.",
        "In all these cases we humanly make an addition to some sensible\nreality, and that reality tolerates the addition. All the additions\n’agree’ with the reality; they fit it, while they build it out. No\none of them is false. Which may be treated as the more true, depends\naltogether on the human use of it. If the 27 is a number of dollars\nwhich I find in a drawer where I had left 28, it is 28 minus 1. If\nit is the number of inches in a shelf which I wish to insert into a\ncupboard 26 inches wide, it is 26 plus 1. If I wish to ennoble the\nheavens by the constellations I see there, ’Charles’s Wain’ would be\nmore true than ’Dipper.’ My friend Frederick Myers was humorously\nindignant that that prodigious star-group should remind us Americans\nof nothing but a culinary utensil.",
        "What shall we call a THING anyhow? It seems quite arbitrary, for we\ncarve out everything, just as we carve out constellations, to suit\nour human purposes. For me, this whole ’audience’ is one thing,\nwhich grows now restless, now attentive. I have no use at present\nfor its individual units, so I don’t consider them. So of an ’army,’\nof a ’nation.’ But in your own eyes, ladies and gentlemen, to call\nyou ’audience’ is an accidental way of taking you. The permanently\nreal things for you are your individual persons. To an anatomist,\nagain, those persons are but organisms, and the real things are the\norgans. Not the organs, so much as their constituent cells, say the\nhistologists; not the cells, but their molecules, say in turn the\nchemists.",
        "We break the flux of sensible reality into things, then, at our\nwill. We create the subjects of our true as well as of our false\npropositions.",
        "We create the predicates also. Many of the predicates of things\nexpress only the relations of the things to us and to our feelings.\nSuch predicates of course are human additions. Caesar crossed the\nRubicon, and was a menace to Rome’s freedom. He is also an American\nschool-room pest, made into one by the reaction of our schoolboys on\nhis writings. The added predicate is as true of him as the earlier\nones.",
        "You see how naturally one comes to the humanistic principle: you\ncan’t weed out the human contribution. Our nouns and adjectives are\nall humanized heirlooms, and in the theories we build them into, the\ninner order and arrangement is wholly dictated by human\nconsiderations, intellectual consistency being one of them.\nMathematics and logic themselves are fermenting with human\nrearrangements; physics, astronomy and biology follow massive cues\nof preference. We plunge forward into the field of fresh experience\nwith the beliefs our ancestors and we have made already; these\ndetermine what we notice; what we notice determines what we do; what\nwe do again determines what we experience; so from one thing to\nanother, altho the stubborn fact remains that there IS a sensible\nflux, what is true of it seems from first to last to be largely a\nmatter of our own creation.",
        "We build the flux out inevitably. The great question is: does it,\nwith our additions, rise or fall in value? Are the additions WORTHY\nor UNWORTHY? Suppose a universe composed of seven stars, and nothing\nelse but three human witnesses and their critic. One witness names\nthe stars ’Great Bear’; one calls them ’Charles’s Wain’; one calls\nthem the ’Dipper.’ Which human addition has made the best universe\nof the given stellar material? If Frederick Myers were the critic,\nhe would have no hesitation in ’turning-down’ the American witness.",
        "Lotze has in several places made a deep suggestion. We naively\nassume, he says, a relation between reality and our minds which may\nbe just the opposite of the true one. Reality, we naturally think,\nstands ready-made and complete, and our intellects supervene with\nthe one simple duty of describing it as it is already. But may not\nour descriptions, Lotze asks, be themselves important additions to\nreality? And may not previous reality itself be there, far less for\nthe purpose of reappearing unaltered in our knowledge, than for the\nvery purpose of stimulating our minds to such additions as shall\nenhance the universe’s total value. “Die erhohung des vorgefundenen\ndaseins” is a phrase used by Professor Eucken somewhere, which\nreminds one of this suggestion by the great Lotze.",
        "It is identically our pragmatistic conception. In our cognitive as\nwell as in our active life we are creative. We ADD, both to the\nsubject and to the predicate part of reality. The world stands\nreally malleable, waiting to receive its final touches at our hands.\nLike the kingdom of heaven, it suffers human violence willingly. Man\nENGENDERS truths upon it.",
        "No one can deny that such a role would add both to our dignity and\nto our responsibility as thinkers. To some of us it proves a most\ninspiring notion. Signer Papini, the leader of italian pragmatism,\ngrows fairly dithyrambic over the view that it opens, of man’s\ndivinely-creative functions.",
        "The import of the difference between pragmatism and rationalism is\nnow in sight throughout its whole extent. The essential contrast is\nthat for rationalism reality is ready-made and complete from all\neternity, while for pragmatism it is still in the making, and awaits\npart of its complexion from the future. On the one side the universe\nis absolutely secure, on the other it is still pursuing its\nadventures.",
        "We have got into rather deep water with this humanistic view, and it\nis no wonder that misunderstanding gathers round it. It is accused\nof being a doctrine of caprice. Mr. Bradley, for example, says that\na humanist, if he understood his own doctrine, would have to “hold\nany end however perverted to be rational if I insist on it\npersonally, and any idea however mad to be the truth if only some\none is resolved that he will have it so.” The humanist view of\n’reality,’ as something resisting, yet malleable, which controls our\nthinking as an energy that must be taken ’account’ of incessantly\n(tho not necessarily merely COPIED) is evidently a difficult one to\nintroduce to novices. The situation reminds me of one that I have\npersonally gone through. I once wrote an essay on our right to\nbelieve, which I unluckily called the WILL to Believe. All the\ncritics, neglecting the essay, pounced upon the title.\nPsychologically it was impossible, morally it was iniquitous. The\n\"will to deceive,” the “will to make-believe,” were wittily proposed\nas substitutes for it.",
        "THE ALTERNATIVE BETWEEN PRAGMATISM AND RATIONALISM, IN THE SHAPE IN\nWHICH WE NOW HAVE IT BEFORE US, IS NO LONGER A QUESTION IN THE\nTHEORY OF KNOWLEDGE, IT CONCERNS THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE\nITSELF.",
        "On the pragmatist side we have only one edition of the universe,\nunfinished, growing in all sorts of places, especially in the places\nwhere thinking beings are at work.",
        "On the rationalist side we have a universe in many editions, one\nreal one, the infinite folio, or edition de luxe, eternally\ncomplete; and then the various finite editions, full of false\nreadings, distorted and mutilated each in its own way.",
        "So the rival metaphysical hypotheses of pluralism and monism here\ncome back upon us. I will develope their differences during the\nremainder of our hour.",
        "And first let me say that it is impossible not to see a\ntemperamental difference at work in the choice of sides. The\nrationalist mind, radically taken, is of a doctrinaire and\nauthoritative complexion: the phrase ’must be’ is ever on its lips.\nThe belly-band of its universe must be tight. A radical pragmatist\non the other hand is a happy-go-lucky anarchistic sort of creature.\nIf he had to live in a tub like Diogenes he wouldn’t mind at all if\nthe hoops were loose and the staves let in the sun.",
        "Now the idea of this loose universe affects your typical\nrationalists in much the same way as ’freedom of the press’ might\naffect a veteran official in the russian bureau of censorship; or as\n’simplified spelling’ might affect an elderly schoolmistress. It\naffects him as the swarm of protestant sects affects a papist\nonlooker. It appears as backboneless and devoid of principle as\n’opportunism’ in politics appears to an old-fashioned french\nlegitimist, or to a fanatical believer in the divine right of the\npeople.",
        "For pluralistic pragmatism, truth grows up inside of all the finite\nexperiences. They lean on each other, but the whole of them, if such\na whole there be, leans on nothing. All ’homes’ are in finite\nexperience; finite experience as such is homeless. Nothing outside\nof the flux secures the issue of it. It can hope salvation only from\nits own intrinsic promises and potencies.",
        "To rationalists this describes a tramp and vagrant world, adrift in\nspace, with neither elephant nor tortoise to plant the sole of its\nfoot upon. It is a set of stars hurled into heaven without even a\ncentre of gravity to pull against. In other spheres of life it is\ntrue that we have got used to living in a state of relative\ninsecurity. The authority of  ’the State,’ and that of an absolute\n’moral law,’ have resolved themselves into expediencies, and holy\nchurch has resolved itself into ’meeting-houses.’ Not so as yet\nwithin the philosophic class-rooms. A universe with such as US\ncontributing to create its truth, a world delivered to OUR\nopportunisms and OUR private judgments! Home-rule for Ireland would\nbe a millennium in comparison. We’re no more fit for such a part\nthan the Filipinos are ’fit for self-government.’ Such a world would\nnot be RESPECTABLE, philosophically. It is a trunk without a tag, a\ndog without a collar, in the eyes of most professors of philosophy.",
        "What then would tighten this loose universe, according to the\nprofessors?",
        "Something to support the finite many, to tie it to, to unify and\nanchor it. Something unexposed to accident, something eternal and\nunalterable. The mutable in experience must be founded on\nimmutability. Behind our de facto world, our world in act, there\nmust be a de jure duplicate fixed and previous, with all that can\nhappen here already there in posse, every drop of blood, every\nsmallest item, appointed and provided, stamped and branded, without\nchance of variation. The negatives that haunt our ideals here below\nmust be themselves negated in the absolutely Real. This alone makes\nthe universe solid. This is the resting deep. We live upon the\nstormy surface; but with this our anchor holds, for it grapples\nrocky bottom. This is Wordsworth’s “central peace subsisting at the\nheart of endless agitation.” This is Vivekananda’s mystical One of\nwhich I read to you. This is Reality with the big R, reality that\nmakes the timeless claim, reality to which defeat can’t happen. This\nis what the men of principles, and in general all the men whom I\ncalled tender-minded in my first lecture, think themselves obliged\nto postulate.",
        "And this, exactly this, is what the tough-minded of that lecture\nfind themselves moved to call a piece of perverse abstraction-\nworship. The tough-minded are the men whose alpha and omega are\nFACTS. Behind the bare phenomenal facts, as my tough-minded old\nfriend Chauncey Wright, the great Harvard empiricist of my youth,\nused to say, there is NOTHING. When a rationalist insists that\nbehind the facts there is the GROUND of the facts, the POSSIBILITY\nof the facts, the tougher empiricists accuse him of taking the mere\nname and nature of a fact and clapping it behind the fact as a\nduplicate entity to make it possible. That such sham grounds are\noften invoked is notorious. At a surgical operation I heard a\nbystander ask a doctor why the patient breathed so deeply. “Because\nether is a respiratory stimulant,” the doctor answered. “Ah!” said\nthe questioner, as if relieved by the explanation. But this is like\nsaying that cyanide of potassium kills because it is a ’poison,’ or\nthat it is so cold to-night because it is ’winter,’ or that we have\nfive fingers because we are ’pentadactyls.’ These are but names for\nthe facts, taken from the facts, and then treated as previous and\nexplanatory. The tender-minded notion of an absolute reality is,\naccording to the radically tough-minded, framed on just this\npattern. It is but our summarizing name for the whole spread-out and\nstrung-along mass of phenomena, treated as if it were a different\nentity, both one and previous.",
        "You see how differently people take things. The world we live in\nexists diffused and distributed, in the form of an indefinitely\nnumerous lot of eaches, coherent in all sorts of ways and degrees;\nand the tough-minded are perfectly willing to keep them at that\nvaluation. They can stand that kind of world, their temper being\nwell adapted to its insecurity. Not so the tender-minded party. They\nmust back the world we find ourselves born into by “another and a\nbetter” world in which the eaches form an All and the All a One that\nlogically presupposes, co-implicates, and secures each EACH without\nexception.",
        "Must we as pragmatists be radically tough-minded? or can we treat\nthe absolute edition of the world as a legitimate hypothesis? It is\ncertainly legitimate, for it is thinkable, whether we take it in its\nabstract or in its concrete shape.",
        "By taking it abstractly I mean placing it behind our finite life as\nwe place the word ’winter’ behind to-night’s cold weather. ’Winter’\nis only the name for a certain number of days which we find\ngenerally characterized by cold weather, but it guarantees nothing\nin that line, for our thermometer to-morrow may soar into the 70’s.\nNevertheless the word is a useful one to plunge forward with into\nthe stream of our experience. It cuts off certain probabilities and\nsets up others: you can put away your straw-hats; you can unpack\nyour arctics. It is a summary of things to look for. It names a part\nof nature’s habits, and gets you ready for their continuation. It is\na definite instrument abstracted from experience, a conceptual\nreality that you must take account of, and which reflects you\ntotally back into sensible realities. The pragmatist is the last\nperson to deny the reality of such abstractions. They are so much\npast experience funded.",
        "But taking the absolute edition of the world concretely means a\ndifferent hypothesis. Rationalists take it concretely and OPPOSE it\nto the world’s finite editions. They give it a particular nature. It\nis perfect, finished. Everything known there is known along with\neverything else; here, where ignorance reigns, far otherwise. If\nthere is want there, there also is the satisfaction provided. Here\nall is process; that world is timeless. Possibilities obtain in our\nworld; in the absolute world, where all that is NOT is from eternity\nimpossible, and all that IS is necessary, the category of\npossibility has no application. In this world crimes and horrors are\nregrettable. In that totalized world regret obtains not, for “the\nexistence of ill in the temporal order is the very condition of the\nperfection of the eternal order.”",
        "Once more, either hypothesis is legitimate in pragmatist eyes, for\neither has its uses. Abstractly, or taken like the word winter, as a\nmemorandum of past experience that orients us towards the future,\nthe notion of the absolute world is indispensable. Concretely taken,\nit is also indispensable, at least to certain minds, for it\ndetermines them religiously, being often a thing to change their\nlives by, and by changing their lives, to change whatever in the\nouter order depends on them.",
        "We cannot therefore methodically join the tough minds in their\nrejection of the whole notion of a world beyond our finite\nexperience. One misunderstanding of pragmatism is to identify it\nwith positivistic tough-mindedness, to suppose that it scorns every\nrationalistic notion as so much jabber and gesticulation, that it\nloves intellectual anarchy as such and prefers a sort of wolf-world\nabsolutely unpent and wild and without a master or a collar to any\nphilosophic class-room product, whatsoever. I have said so much in\nthese lectures against the over-tender forms of rationalism, that I\nam prepared for some misunderstanding here, but I confess that the\namount of it that I have found in this very audience surprises me,\nfor I have simultaneously defended rationalistic hypotheses so far\nas these re-direct you fruitfully into experience.",
        "For instance I receive this morning this question on a post-card:\n\"Is a pragmatist necessarily a complete materialist and agnostic?\"\nOne of my oldest friends, who ought to know me better, writes me a\nletter that accuses the pragmatism I am recommending, of shutting\nout all wider metaphysical views and condemning us to the most\nterre-a-terre naturalism. Let me read you some extracts from it.",
        "“It seems to me,” my friend writes, “that the pragmatic objection to\npragmatism lies in the fact that it might accentuate the narrowness\nof narrow minds.",
        "“Your call to the rejection of the namby-pamby and the wishy-washy\nis of course inspiring. But although it is salutary and stimulating\nto be told that one should be responsible for the immediate issues\nand bearings of his words and thoughts, I decline to be deprived of\nthe pleasure and profit of dwelling also on remoter bearings and\nissues, and it is the TENDENCY of pragmatism to refuse this\nprivilege.",
        "“In short, it seems to me that the limitations, or rather the\ndangers, of the pragmatic tendency, are analogous to those which\nbeset the unwary followers of the ’natural sciences.’ Chemistry and\nphysics are eminently pragmatic and many of their devotees, smugly\ncontent with the data that their weights and measures furnish, feel\nan infinite pity and disdain for all students of philosophy and\nmeta-physics, whomsoever. And of course everything can be expressed-\n-after a fashion, and ’theoretically’–in terms of chemistry and\nphysics, that is, EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE VITAL PRINCIPLE OF THE\nWHOLE, and that, they say, there is no pragmatic use in trying to\nexpress; it has no bearings–FOR THEM. I for my part refuse to be\npersuaded that we cannot look beyond the obvious pluralism of the\nnaturalist and the pragmatist to a logical unity in which they take\nno interest.”",
        "How is such a conception of the pragmatism I am advocating possible,\nafter my first and second lectures? I have all along been offering\nit expressly as a mediator between tough-mindedness and tender-\nmindedness. If the notion of a world ante rem, whether taken\nabstractly like the word winter, or concretely as the hypothesis of\nan Absolute, can be shown to have any consequences whatever for our\nlife, it has a meaning. If the meaning works, it will have SOME\ntruth that ought to be held to through all possible reformulations,\nfor pragmatism.",
        "The absolutistic hypothesis, that perfection is eternal, aboriginal,\nand most real, has a perfectly definite meaning, and it works\nreligiously. To examine how, will be the subject of my next and\nfinal lecture.",
        "At the close of the last lecture I reminded you of the first one, in\nwhich I had opposed tough-mindedness to tender-mindedness and\nrecommended pragmatism as their mediator. Tough-mindedness\npositively rejects tender-mindedness’s hypothesis of an eternal\nperfect edition of the universe coexisting with our finite\nexperience.",
        "On pragmatic principles we cannot reject any hypothesis if\nconsequences useful to life flow from it. Universal conceptions, as\nthings to take account of, may be as real for pragmatism as\nparticular sensations are. They have indeed no meaning and no\nreality if they have no use. But if they have any use they have that\namount of meaning. And the meaning will be true if the use squares\nwell with life’s other uses.",
        "Well, the use of the Absolute is proved by the whole course of men’s\nreligious history. The eternal arms are then beneath. Remember\nVivekananda’s use of the Atman: it is indeed not a scientific use,\nfor we can make no particular deductions from it. It is emotional\nand spiritual altogether.",
        "It is always best to discuss things by the help of concrete\nexamples. Let me read therefore some of those verses entitled “To\nYou” by Walt Whitman–\"You” of course meaning the reader or hearer\nof the poem whosoever he or she may be.",
        "Whoever you are, now I place my hand upon you, that you be my poem;\nI whisper with my lips close to your ear,\nI have loved many women and men, but I love none better than you.",
        "O I have been dilatory and dumb;\nI should have made my way straight to you long ago;\nI should have blabb’d nothing but you, I should have chanted nothing\nbut you.",
        "I will leave all, and come and make the hymns of you;\nNone have understood you, but I understand you;\nNone have done justice to you–you have not done justice to\nyourself;\nNone but have found you imperfect–I only find no imperfection in\nyou.",
        "O I could sing such grandeurs and glories about you!\nYou have not known what you are–you have slumber’d upon yourself\nall your life;\nWhat you have done returns already in mockeries.",
        "But the mockeries are not you;\nUnderneath them, and within them, I see you lurk;\nI pursue you where none else has pursued you;\nSilence, the desk, the flippant expression, the night, the\naccustom’d routine, if these conceal you from others, or from\nyourself, they do not conceal you from me;\nThe shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure complexion, if these\nbalk others, they do not balk me,\nThe pert apparel, the deform’d attitude, drunkenness, greed,\npremature death, all these I part aside.",
        "There is no endowment in man or woman that is not tallied in you;\nThere is no virtue, no beauty, in man or woman, but as good is in\nyou;\nNo pluck, no endurance in others, but as good is in you;\nNo pleasure waiting for others, but an equal pleasure waits for you.",
        "Whoever you are! claim your own at any hazard!\nThese shows of the east and west are tame, compared to you;\nThese immense meadows–these interminable rivers–you are immense\nand interminable as they;\nYou are he or she who is master or mistress over them,\nMaster or mistress in your own right over Nature, elements, pain,\npassion, dissolution.",
        "The hopples fall from your ankles–you find an unfailing\nsufficiency;\nOld or young, male or female, rude, low, rejected by the rest,\nwhatever you are promulges itself;\nThrough birth, life, death, burial, the means are provided, nothing\nis scanted;\nThrough angers, losses, ambition, ignorance, ennui, what you are\npicks its way.",
        "Verily a fine and moving poem, in any case, but there are two ways\nof taking it, both useful.",
        "One is the monistic way, the mystical way of pure cosmic emotion.\nThe glories and grandeurs, they are yours absolutely, even in the\nmidst of your defacements. Whatever may happen to you, whatever you\nmay appear to be, inwardly you are safe. Look back, LIE back, on\nyour true principle of being! This is the famous way of quietism, of\nindifferentism. Its enemies compare it to a spiritual opium. Yet\npragmatism must respect this way, for it has massive historic\nvindication.",
        "But pragmatism sees another way to be respected also, the\npluralistic way of interpreting the poem. The you so glorified, to\nwhich the hymn is sung, may mean your better possibilities\nphenomenally taken, or the specific redemptive effects even of your\nfailures, upon yourself or others. It may mean your loyalty to the\npossibilities of others whom you admire and love so, that you are\nwilling to accept your own poor life, for it is that glory’s\npartner. You can at least appreciate, applaud, furnish the audience,\nof so brave a total world. Forget the low in yourself, then, think\nonly of the high. Identify your life therewith; then, through\nangers, losses, ignorance, ennui, whatever you thus make yourself,\nwhatever you thus most deeply are, picks its way.",
        "In either way of taking the poem, it encourages fidelity to\nourselves. Both ways satisfy; both sanctify the human flux. Both\npaint the portrait of the YOU on a gold-background. But the\nbackground of the first way is the static One, while in the second\nway it means possibles in the plural, genuine possibles, and it has\nall the restlessness of that conception.",
        "Noble enough is either way of reading the poem; but plainly the\npluralistic way agrees with the pragmatic temper best, for it\nimmediately suggests an infinitely larger number of the details of\nfuture experience to our mind. It sets definite activities in us at\nwork. Altho this second way seems prosaic and earthborn in\ncomparison with the first way, yet no one can accuse it of tough-\nmindedness in any brutal sense of the term. Yet if, as pragmatists,\nyou should positively set up the second way AGAINST the first way,\nyou would very likely be misunderstood. You would be accused of\ndenying nobler conceptions, and of being an ally of tough-mindedness\nin the worst sense.",
        "You remember the letter from a member of this audience from which I\nread some extracts at our previous meeting. Let me read you an\nadditional extract now. It shows a vagueness in realizing the\nalternatives before us which I think is very widespread.",
        "“I believe,” writes my friend and correspondent, “in pluralism; I\nbelieve that in our search for truth we leap from one floating cake\nof ice to another, on an infinite sea, and that by each of our acts\nwe make new truths possible and old ones impossible; I believe that\neach man is responsible for making the universe better, and that if\nhe does not do this it will be in so far left undone.",
        "“Yet at the same time I am willing to endure that my children should\nbe incurably sick and suffering (as they are not) and I myself\nstupid and yet with brains enough to see my stupidity, only on one\ncondition, namely, that through the construction, in imagination and\nby reasoning, of a RATIONAL UNITY OF ALL THINGS, I can conceive my\nacts and my thoughts and my troubles as SUPPLEMENTED: BY ALL THE\nOTHER PHENOMENA OF THE WORLD, AND AS FORMING–WHEN THUS\nSUPPLEMENTED–A SCHEME WHICH I APPROVE AND ADOPT AS MY I OWN; and\nfor my part I refuse to be persuaded that we cannot look beyond the\nobvious pluralism of the naturalist and pragmatist to a logical\nunity in which they take no interest or stock.”",
        "Such a fine expression of personal faith warms the heart of the\nhearer. But how much does it clear his philosophic head? Does the\nwriter consistently favor the monistic, or the pluralistic,\ninterpretation of the world’s poem? His troubles become atoned for\nWHEN THUS SUPPLEMENTED, he says, supplemented, that is, by all the\nremedies that THE OTHER PHENOMENA may supply. Obviously here the\nwriter faces forward into the particulars of experience, which he\ninterprets in a pluralistic-melioristic way.",
        "But he believes himself to face backward. He speaks of what he calls\nthe rational UNITY of things, when all the while he really means\ntheir possible empirical UNIFICATION. He supposes at the same time\nthat the pragmatist, because he criticizes rationalism’s abstract\nOne, is cut off from the consolation of believing in the saving\npossibilities of the concrete many. He fails in short to distinguish\nbetween taking the world’s perfection as a necessary principle, and\ntaking it only as a possible terminus ad quem.",
        "I regard the writer of this letter as a genuine pragmatist, but as a\npragmatist sans le savoir. He appears to me as one of that numerous\nclass of philosophic amateurs whom I spoke of in my first lecture,\nas wishing to have all the good things going, without being too\ncareful as to how they agree or disagree. “Rational unity of all\nthings” is so inspiring a formula, that he brandishes it offhand,\nand abstractly accuses pluralism of conflicting with it (for the\nbare names do conflict), altho concretely he means by it just the\npragmatistically unified and ameliorated world. Most of us remain in\nthis essential vagueness, and it is well that we should; but in the\ninterest of clear-headedness it is well that some of us should go\nfarther, so I will try now to focus a little more discriminatingly\non this particular religious point.",
        "Is then this you of yous, this absolutely real world, this unity\nthat yields the moral inspiration and has the religious value, to be\ntaken monistically or pluralistically? Is it ante rem or in rebus?\nIs it a principle or an end, an absolute or an ultimate, a first or\na last? Does it make you look forward or lie back? It is certainly\nworth while not to clump the two things together, for if\ndiscriminated, they have decidedly diverse meanings for life.",
        "Please observe that the whole dilemma revolves pragmatically about\nthe notion of the world’s possibilities. Intellectually, rationalism\ninvokes its absolute principle of unity as a ground of possibility\nfor the many facts. Emotionally, it sees it as a container and\nlimiter of possibilities, a guarantee that the upshot shall be good.\nTaken in this way, the absolute makes all good things certain, and\nall bad things impossible (in the eternal, namely), and may be said\nto transmute the entire category of possibility into categories more\nsecure. One sees at this point that the great religious difference\nlies between the men who insist that the world MUST AND SHALL BE,\nand those who are contented with believing that the world MAY BE,\nsaved. The whole clash of rationalistic and empiricist religion is\nthus over the validity of possibility. It is necessary therefore to\nbegin by focusing upon that word. What may the word ’possible’\ndefinitely mean?",
        "To unreflecting men the possible means a sort of third estate of\nbeing, less real than existence, more real than non-existence, a\ntwilight realm, a hybrid status, a limbo into which and out of which\nrealities ever and anon are made to pass. Such a conception is of\ncourse too vague and nondescript to satisfy us. Here, as elsewhere,\nthe only way to extract a term’s meaning is to use the pragmatic\nmethod on it. When you say that a thing is possible, what difference\ndoes it make?",
        "It makes at least this difference that if anyone calls it impossible\nyou can contradict him, if anyone calls it actual you can contradict\nHIM, and if anyone calls it necessary you can contradict him too.\nBut these privileges of contradiction don’t amount to much. When you\nsay a thing is possible, does not that make some farther difference\nin terms of actual fact?",
        "It makes at least this negative difference that if the statement be\ntrue, it follows that there is nothing extant capable of preventing\nthe possible thing. The absence of real grounds of interference may\nthus be said to make things not impossible, possible therefore in\nthe bare or abstract sense.",
        "But most possibles are not bare, they are concretely grounded, or\nwell-grounded, as we say. What does this mean pragmatically? It\nmeans, not only that there are no preventive conditions present, but\nthat some of the conditions of production of the possible thing\nactually are here. Thus a concretely possible chicken means: (1)\nthat the idea of chicken contains no essential self-contradiction;\n(2) that no boys, skunks, or other enemies are about; and (3) that\nat least an actual egg exists. Possible chicken means actual egg–\nplus actual sitting hen, or incubator, or what not. As the actual\nconditions approach completeness the chicken becomes a better-and-\nbetter-grounded possibility. When the conditions are entirely\ncomplete, it ceases to be a possibility, and turns into an actual\nfact.",
        "Let us apply this notion to the salvation of the world. What does it\npragmatically mean to say that this is possible? It means that some\nof the conditions of the world’s deliverance do actually exist. The\nmore of them there are existent, the fewer preventing conditions you\ncan find, the better-grounded is the salvation’s possibility, the\nmore PROBABLE does the fact of the deliverance become.",
        "So much for our preliminary look at possibility.",
        "Now it would contradict the very spirit of life to say that our\nminds must be indifferent and neutral in questions like that of the\nworld’s salvation. Anyone who pretends to be neutral writes himself\ndown here as a fool and a sham. We all do wish to minimize the\ninsecurity of the universe; we are and ought to be unhappy when we\nregard it as exposed to every enemy and open to every life-\ndestroying draft. Nevertheless there are unhappy men who think the\nsalvation of the world impossible. Theirs is the doctrine known as\npessimism.",
        "Optimism in turn would be the doctrine that thinks the world’s\nsalvation inevitable.",
        "Midway between the two there stands what may be called the doctrine\nof meliorism, tho it has hitherto figured less as a doctrine than as\nan attitude in human affairs. Optimism has always been the regnant\nDOCTRINE in european philosophy. Pessimism was only recently\nintroduced by Schopenhauer and counts few systematic defenders as\nyet. Meliorism treats salvation as neither inevitable nor\nimpossible. It treats it as a possibility, which becomes more and\nmore of a probability the more numerous the actual conditions of\nsalvation become.",
        "It is clear that pragmatism must incline towards meliorism. Some\nconditions of the world’s salvation are actually extant, and she\ncannot possibly close her eyes to this fact: and should the residual\nconditions come, salvation would become an accomplished reality.\nNaturally the terms I use here are exceedingly summary. You may\ninterpret the word ’salvation’ in any way you like, and make it as\ndiffuse and distributive, or as climacteric and integral a\nphenomenon as you please.",
        "Take, for example, any one of us in this room with the ideals which\nhe cherishes, and is willing to live and work for. Every such ideal\nrealized will be one moment in the world’s salvation. But these\nparticular ideals are not bare abstract possibilities. They are\ngrounded, they are LIVE possibilities, for we are their live\nchampions and pledges, and if the complementary conditions come and\nadd themselves, our ideals will become actual things. What now are\nthe complementary conditions? They are first such a mixture of\nthings as will in the fulness of time give us a chance, a gap that\nwe can spring into, and, finally, OUR ACT.",
        "Does our act then CREATE the world’s salvation so far as it makes\nroom for itself, so far as it leaps into the gap? Does it create,\nnot the whole world’s salvation of course, but just so much of this\nas itself covers of the world’s extent?",
        "Here I take the bull by the horns, and in spite of the whole crew of\nrationalists and monists, of whatever brand they be, I ask WHY NOT?\nOur acts, our turning-places, where we seem to ourselves to make\nourselves and grow, are the parts of the world to which we are\nclosest, the parts of which our knowledge is the most intimate and\ncomplete. Why should we not take them at their face-value? Why may\nthey not be the actual turning-places and growing-places which they\nseem to be, of the world–why not the workshop of being, where we\ncatch fact in the making, so that nowhere may the world grow in any\nother kind of way than this?",
        "Irrational! we are told. How can new being come in local spots and\npatches which add themselves or stay away at random, independently\nof the rest? There must be a reason for our acts, and where in the\nlast resort can any reason be looked for save in the material\npressure or the logical compulsion of the total nature of the world?\nThere can be but one real agent of growth, or seeming growth,\nanywhere, and that agent is the integral world itself. It may grow\nall-over, if growth there be, but that single parts should grow per\nse is irrational.",
        "But if one talks of rationality and of reasons for things, and\ninsists that they can’t just come in spots, what KIND of a reason\ncan there ultimately be why anything should come at all? Talk of\nlogic and necessity and categories and the absolute and the contents\nof the whole philosophical machine-shop as you will, the only REAL\nreason I can think of why anything should ever come is that someone\nwishes it to be here. It is DEMANDED, demanded, it may be, to give\nrelief to no matter how small a fraction of the world’s mass. This\nis living reason, and compared with it material causes and logical\nnecessities are spectral things.",
        "In short the only fully rational world would be the world of\nwishing-caps, the world of telepathy, where every desire is\nfulfilled instanter, without having to consider or placate\nsurrounding or intermediate powers. This is the Absolute’s own\nworld. He calls upon the phenomenal world to be, and it IS, exactly\nas he calls for it, no other condition being required. In our world,\nthe wishes of the individual are only one condition. Other\nindividuals are there with other wishes and they must be propitiated\nfirst. So Being grows under all sorts of resistances in this world\nof the many, and, from compromise to compromise, only gets organized\ngradually into what may be called secondarily rational shape. We\napproach the wishing-cap type of organization only in a few\ndepartments of life. We want water and we turn a faucet. We want a\nkodak-picture and we press a button. We want information and we\ntelephone. We want to travel and we buy a ticket. In these and\nsimilar cases, we hardly need to do more than the wishing–the world\nis rationally organized to do the rest.",
        "But this talk of rationality is a parenthesis and a digression. What\nwe were discussing was the idea of a world growing not integrally\nbut piecemeal by the contributions of its several parts. Take the\nhypothesis seriously and as a live one. Suppose that the world’s\nauthor put the case to you before creation, saying: “I am going to\nmake a world not certain to be saved, a world the perfection of\nwhich shall be conditional merely, the condition being that each\nseveral agent does its own ’level best.’ I offer you the chance of\ntaking part in such a world. Its safety, you see, is unwarranted. It\nis a real adventure, with real danger, yet it may win through. It is\na social scheme of co-operative work genuinely to be done. Will you\njoin the procession? Will you trust yourself and trust the other\nagents enough to face the risk?”",
        "Should you in all seriousness, if participation in such a world were\nproposed to you, feel bound to reject it as not safe enough? Would\nyou say that, rather than be part and parcel of so fundamentally\npluralistic and irrational a universe, you preferred to relapse into\nthe slumber of nonentity from which you had been momentarily aroused\nby the tempter’s voice?",
        "Of course if you are normally constituted, you would do nothing of\nthe sort. There is a healthy-minded buoyancy in most of us which\nsuch a universe would exactly fit. We would therefore accept the\noffer–\"Top! und schlag auf schlag!” It would be just like the world\nwe practically live in; and loyalty to our old nurse Nature would\nforbid us to say no. The world proposed would seem ’rational’ to us\nin the most living way.",
        "Most of us, I say, would therefore welcome the proposition and add\nour fiat to the fiat of the creator. Yet perhaps some would not; for\nthere are morbid minds in every human collection, and to them the\nprospect of a universe with only a fighting chance of safety would\nprobably make no appeal. There are moments of discouragement in us\nall, when we are sick of self and tired of vainly striving. Our own\nlife breaks down, and we fall into the attitude of the prodigal son.\nWe mistrust the chances of things. We want a universe where we can\njust give up, fall on our father’s neck, and be absorbed into the\nabsolute life as a drop of water melts into the river or the sea.",
        "The peace and rest, the security desiderated at such moments is\nsecurity against the bewildering accidents of so much finite\nexperience. Nirvana means safety from this everlasting round of\nadventures of which the world of sense consists. The hindoo and the\nbuddhist, for this is essentially their attitude, are simply afraid,\nafraid of more experience, afraid of life.",
        "And to men of this complexion, religious monism comes with its\nconsoling words: “All is needed and essential–even you with your\nsick soul and heart. All are one with God, and with God all is well.\nThe everlasting arms are beneath, whether in the world of finite\nappearances you seem to fail or to succeed.” There can be no doubt\nthat when men are reduced to their last sick extremity absolutism is\nthe only saving scheme. Pluralistic moralism simply makes their\nteeth chatter, it refrigerates the very heart within their breast.",
        "So we see concretely two types of religion in sharp contrast. Using\nour old terms of comparison, we may say that the absolutistic scheme\nappeals to the tender-minded while the pluralistic scheme appeals to\nthe tough. Many persons would refuse to call the pluralistic scheme\nreligious at all. They would call it moralistic, and would apply the\nword religious to the monistic scheme alone. Religion in the sense\nof self-surrender, and moralism in the sense of self-sufficingness,\nhave been pitted against each other as incompatibles frequently\nenough in the history of human thought.",
        "We stand here before the final question of philosophy. I said in my\nfourth lecture that I believed the monistic-pluralistic alternative\nto be the deepest and most pregnant question that our minds can\nframe. Can it be that the disjunction is a final one? that only one\nside can be true? Are a pluralism and monism genuine incompatibles?\nSo that, if the world were really pluralistically constituted, if it\nreally existed distributively and were made up of a lot of eaches,\nit could only be saved piecemeal and de facto as the result of their\nbehavior, and its epic history in no wise short-circuited by some\nessential oneness in which the severalness were already ’taken up’\nbeforehand and eternally ’overcome’? If this were so, we should have\nto choose one philosophy or the other. We could not say ’yes, yes’\nto both alternatives. There would have to be a ’no’ in our relations\nwith the possible. We should confess an ultimate disappointment: we\ncould not remain healthy-minded and sick-minded in one indivisible\nact.",
        "Of course as human beings we can be healthy minds on one day and\nsick souls on the next; and as amateur dabblers in philosophy we may\nperhaps be allowed to call ourselves monistic pluralists, or free-\nwill determinists, or whatever else may occur to us of a reconciling\nkind. But as philosophers aiming at clearness and consistency, and\nfeeling the pragmatistic need of squaring truth with truth, the\nquestion is forced upon us of frankly adopting either the tender or\nthe robustious type of thought. In particular THIS query has always\ncome home to me: May not the claims of tender-mindedness go too far?\nMay not the notion of a world already saved in toto anyhow, be too\nsaccharine to stand? May not religious optimism be too idyllic? Must\nALL be saved? Is NO price to be paid in the work of salvation? Is\nthe last word sweet? Is all ’yes, yes’ in the universe? Doesn’t the\nfact of ’no’ stand at the very core of life? Doesn’t the very\n’seriousness’ that we attribute to life mean that ineluctable noes\nand losses form a part of it, that there are genuine sacrifices\nsomewhere, and that something permanently drastic and bitter always\nremains at the bottom of its cup?",
        "I can not speak officially as a pragmatist here; all I can say is\nthat my own pragmatism offers no objection to my taking sides with\nthis more moralistic view, and giving up the claim of total\nreconciliation. The possibility of this is involved in the\npragmatistic willingness to treat pluralism as a serious hypothesis.\nIn the end it is our faith and not our logic that decides such\nquestions, and I deny the right of any pretended logic to veto my\nown faith. I find myself willing to take the universe to be really\ndangerous and adventurous, without therefore backing out and crying\n’no play.’ I am willing to think that the prodigal-son attitude,\nopen to us as it is in many vicissitudes, is not the right and final\nattitude towards the whole of life. I am willing that there should\nbe real losses and real losers, and no total preservation of all\nthat is. I can believe in the ideal as an ultimate, not as an\norigin, and as an extract, not the whole. When the cup is poured\noff, the dregs are left behind forever, but the possibility of what\nis poured off is sweet enough to accept.",
        "As a matter of fact countless human imaginations live in this\nmoralistic and epic kind of a universe, and find its disseminated\nand strung-along successes sufficient for their rational needs.\nThere is a finely translated epigram in the greek anthology which\nadmirably expresses this state of mind, this acceptance of loss as\nunatoned for, even tho the lost element might be one’s self:",
        "“A shipwrecked sailor, buried on this coast, Bids you set sail.\nFull many a gallant bark, when we were lost, Weathered the gale.”",
        "Those puritans who answered ’yes’ to the question: Are you willing\nto be damned for God’s glory? were in this objective and magnanimous\ncondition of mind. The way of escape from evil on this system is NOT\nby getting it ’aufgehoben,’ or preserved in the whole as an element\nessential but ’overcome.’ It is by dropping it out altogether,\nthrowing it overboard and getting beyond it, helping to make a\nuniverse that shall forget its very place and name.",
        "It is then perfectly possible to accept sincerely a drastic kind of\na universe from which the element of ’seriousness’ is not to be\nexpelled. Whoso does so is, it seems to me, a genuine pragmatist. He\nis willing to live on a scheme of uncertified possibilities which he\ntrusts; willing to pay with his own person, if need be, for the\nrealization of the ideals which he frames.",
        "What now actually ARE the other forces which he trusts to co-operate\nwith him, in a universe of such a type? They are at least his fellow\nmen, in the stage of being which our actual universe has reached.\nBut are there not superhuman forces also, such as religious men of\nthe pluralistic type we have been considering have always believed\nin? Their words may have sounded monistic when they said “there is\nno God but God\"; but the original polytheism of mankind has only\nimperfectly and vaguely sublimated itself into monotheism, and\nmonotheism itself, so far as it was religious and not a scheme of\nclass-room instruction for the metaphysicians, has always viewed God\nas but one helper, primus inter pares, in the midst of all the\nshapers of the great world’s fate.",
        "I fear that my previous lectures, confined as they have been to\nhuman and humanistic aspects, may have left the impression on many\nof you that pragmatism means methodically to leave the superhuman\nout. I have shown small respect indeed for the Absolute, and I have\nuntil this moment spoken of no other superhuman hypothesis but that.\nBut I trust that you see sufficiently that the Absolute has nothing\nbut its superhumanness in common with the theistic God. On\npragmatistic principles, if the hypothesis of God works\nsatisfactorily in the widest sense of the word, it is true. Now\nwhatever its residual difficulties may be, experience shows that it\ncertainly does work, and that the problem is to build it out and\ndetermine it, so that it will combine satisfactorily with all the\nother working truths. I cannot start upon a whole theology at the\nend of this last lecture; but when I tell you that I have written a\nbook on men’s religious experience, which on the whole has been\nregarded as making for the reality of God, you will perhaps exempt\nmy own pragmatism from the charge of being an atheistic system. I\nfirmly disbelieve, myself, that our human experience is the highest\nform of experience extant in the universe. I believe rather that we\nstand in much the same relation to the whole of the universe as our\ncanine and feline pets do to the whole of human life. They inhabit\nour drawing-rooms and libraries. They take part in scenes of whose\nsignificance they have no inkling. They are merely tangent to curves\nof history the beginnings and ends and forms of which pass wholly\nbeyond their ken. So we are tangents to the wider life of things.\nBut, just as many of the dog’s and cat’s ideals coincide with our\nideals, and the dogs and cats have daily living proof of the fact,\nso we may well believe, on the proofs that religious experience\naffords, that higher powers exist and are at work to save the world\non ideal lines similar to our own.",
        "You see that pragmatism can be called religious, if you allow that\nreligion can be pluralistic or merely melioristic in type. But\nwhether you will finally put up with that type of religion or not is\na question that only you yourself can decide. Pragmatism has to\npostpone dogmatic answer, for we do not yet know certainly which\ntype of religion is going to work best in the long run. The various\noverbeliefs of men, their several faith-ventures, are in fact what\nare needed to bring the evidence in. You will probably make your own\nventures severally. If radically tough, the hurly-burly of the\nsensible facts of nature will be enough for you, and you will need\nno religion at all. If radically tender, you will take up with the\nmore monistic form of religion: the pluralistic form, with its\nreliance on possibilities that are not necessities, will not seem to\nafford you security enough.",
        "But if you are neither tough nor tender in an extreme and radical\nsense, but mixed as most of us are, it may seem to you that the type\nof pluralistic and moralistic religion that I have offered is as\ngood a religious synthesis as you are likely to find. Between the\ntwo extremes of crude naturalism on the one hand and transcendental\nabsolutism on the other, you may find that what I take the liberty\nof calling the pragmatistic or melioristic type of theism is exactly\nwhat you require.",
