        "Our arrival at Green Bay was at an unfortunate moment. It was the time\nof a treaty between the United States Government and the Menomonees and\nWaubanakees. Consequently, not only the commissioners of the treaty,\nwith their clerks and officials, but traders, claimants, travellers, and\nidlers innumerable were upon the ground. Most of these were congregated\nin the only hotel the place afforded. This was a tolerably-sized house\nnear the river-side, and as we entered the long dining-room, cold and\ndripping from the open boat, we were infinitely amused at the motley\nassemblage it contained. Various groups were seated around. New comers,\nlike ourselves, stood here and there, for there were not seats enough to\naccommodate all who sought entertainment. The landlord sat calm and\nindifferent, his hands in his pockets, exhibiting all the phlegm of a\nPennsylvania Dutchman.",
        "His fat, notable spouse was trotting round, now stopping to scold about\nsome one who, “burn his skin!” had fallen short in his duty; now\nlaughing good-humoredly until her sides shook, at some witticism\naddressed to her.",
        "She welcomed us very cordially, but to our inquiry, “Can you\naccommodate us?” her reply was, “Not I. I have got twice as many people\nnow as I know what to do with. I have had to turn my own family out of\ntheir quarters, what with the commissioners and the lot of folks that\nhas come in upon us.”",
        "“What are we to do, then? It is too late and stormy to go up to\nShanty-town to seek for lodgings.”",
        "“Well, sit you down and take your supper, and we will see what we can\ndo.”",
        "And she actually did contrive to find a little nook, in which we were\nglad to take refuge from the multitudes around us.",
        "A slight board partition separated us from the apartment occupied by\nGeneral Root, of New York, one of the commissioners of the treaty. The\nsteamer in which we came had brought the mail, at that day a rare\nblessing to the distant settlements. The opening and reading of all the\ndispatches, which the General received about bed-time, had, of course,\nto be gone through with, before he could retire to rest. His eyes being\nweak, his secretaries were employed to read the communications. He was a\nlittle deaf withal, and through the slight division between the two\napartments the contents of the letters, and his comments upon them, were\nunpleasantly audible, as he continually admonished his secretary to\nraise his voice.",
        "“What is that, Walter? Read that over again.”",
        "In vain we coughed and hemmed, and knocked over sundry pieces of\nfurniture. They were too deeply interested to hear aught that passed\naround them, and if we had been politicians we should have had all the\nsecrets of the working-men’s party at our disposal, out of which to\nhave made capital.",
        "The next morning it was still rain! rain! nothing but rain! In spite of\nit, however, the gentlemen would take a small boat to row to the\nsteamer, to bring up the luggage, not the least important part of that\nwhich appertained to us being sundry boxes of silver for paying the\nannuities to the Winnebagoes at the Portage.",
        "I went out with some others of the company upon the piazza, to witness\ntheir departure. A gentleman pointed out to me Fort Howard, on a\nprojecting point of the opposite shore, about three-quarters of a mile\ndistant–the old barracks, the picketed inclosure, the walls, all\nlooking quaint, and, considering their modern erection, really ancient\nand venerable. Presently we turned our attention to the boat, which had\nby this time gained the middle of the river. One of the passengers was\nstanding up in the stern, apparently giving some directions.",
        "“That is rather a venturesome fellow,” remarked one; “if he is not\ncareful he will lose his balance.” And at this moment we saw him\nactually perform a summerset backward, and disappear in the water.",
        "“Oh!” cried I, “he will be drowned!”",
        "The gentlemen laughed. “No, there he is; they are helping him in again.”",
        "The course of the boat was immediately changed, and the party returned\nto the shore. It was not until one disembarked and came dripping and\nlaughing towards me, that I recognized him as my own peculiar property.\nHe was pleased to treat the matter as a joke, but I thought it rather a\nsad beginning of Western experience.",
        "He suffered himself to be persuaded to intrust the care of his effects\nto his friends, and having changed his dress, prepared to remain quietly\nwith me, when just at this moment a vehicle drove up to the door, and we\nrecognized the pleasant, familiar face of our old friend, Judge Doty.",
        "He had received the news of our arrival, and had come to take us at\nonce to his hospitable mansion. We were only too happy to gather\ntogether our bags and travelling-baskets and accompany him without\nfarther ceremony.",
        "Our drive took us first along the edge of Navarino, next through\nShanty-town (the latter a far more appropriate name than the former),\namid mud and mire, over bad roads, and up and down hilly, break-neck\nplaces, until we reached the little brick dwelling of our friends. Mrs.\nDoty received us with such true, sisterly kindness, and everything\nseemed so full of welcome, that we soon felt ourselves at home.",
        "We found that, expecting our arrival, invitations had already been\nprepared to assemble the whole circle of Green Bay society to meet us at\nan evening party–this, in a new country, being the established mode of\ndoing honor to guests or strangers.",
        "We learned, upon inquiry, that Captain Harney, who had kindly offered to\ncome with a boat and crew of soldiers from Fort Winnebago, to convey us\nto that place, our destined home, had not yet arrived; we therefore felt\nat liberty to make arrangements for a few days of social enjoyment at\n“the Bay.”",
        "It was pleasant to people, secluded in such a degree from the world at\nlarge, to bear all the news we had brought–all the particulars of life\nand manners–the thousand little items that the newspapers of that day\ndid not dream of furnishing–the fashions, and that general gossip, in\nshort, which a lady is erroneously supposed more au fait of, than a\ngentleman.",
        "I well remember that, in giving and receiving information, the day\npassed in a pretty uninterrupted stream of communication. All the party\nexcept myself had made the journey, or rather voyage, up the Fox River\nand down the Wisconsin to the Mississippi.",
        "There were plenty of anecdotes of a certain trip performed by the\nthree, in company with a French trader and his two sisters, then making\ntheir debut as Western travellers. The manner in which Mademoiselle\nJulie would borrow, without leave, a fine damask napkin or two, to wipe\nout the ducks in preparation for cooking–the difficulty of persuading\neither of the sisters of the propriety of washing and rinsing their\ntable apparatus nicely before packing it away in the mess-basket, the\nconsequence of which was, that another nice napkin must be stealthily\nwhisked out, to wipe the dishes when the hour for meals arrived–the fun\nof the young gentleman in hunting up his stray articles, thus\nmisappropriated, from the nooks and corners of the boat, tying them with\na cord, and hanging them over the stern, to make their way down the\nWisconsin to Prairie du Chien.",
        "Then there was a capital story of M. Rolette himself. At one point on\nthe route (I think in crossing Winnebago Lake) the travellers met one of\nthe Company’s boats on its way to Green Bay for supplies. M. Rolette was\none of the agents of the Company, and the people in the boat were his\nemployés. Of course after an absence of some weeks from home, the\nmeeting on these lonely waters and the exchanging of news was an\noccasion of great excitement.",
        "The boats were stopped–earnest greetings interchanged–question\nfollowed question.",
        "“Eh bien–have they finished the new house?”",
        "“Oui, Monsieur.”",
        "“Et la cheminée, fume-t-elle?” (Does the chimney smoke?)",
        "“Non, Monsieur.”",
        "“And the harvest–how is that?”",
        "“Very fine, indeed.”",
        "“Is the mill at work?”",
        "“Yes, plenty of water.”",
        "“How is Whip?” (his favorite horse.)",
        "“Oh! Whip is first-rate.”",
        "Everything, in short, about the store, the farm, the business of various\ndescriptions being satisfactorily gone over, there was no occasion for\nfarther delay. It was time to proceed.",
        "“Eh bien–adieu! bon voyage!“",
        "“Arrachez, mes gens!” (Go ahead, men!)",
        "Then suddenly–”Arrêtez! arrêtez!” (Stop, stop!)",
        "“Comment se portent Madame Rolette et les enfans?” (How are Mrs.\nRolette and the children?)",
        "This day, with its excitement, was at length over, and we retired to our\nrest, thankful that we had not General Root and his secretary close to\nour bed’s head, with their budget of political news.",
        "My slumbers were not destined, however, to be quite undisturbed. I was\nawakened, at the first slight peep of dawn, by a sound from an apartment\nbeneath our own–a plaintive, monotonous chant, rising and then falling\nin a sort of mournful cadence. It seemed to me a wail of something\nunearthly–so wild–so strange–so unaccountable. In terror I awoke my\nhusband, who reassured me by telling me it was the morning salutation of\nthe Indians to the opening day.",
        "Some Menomonees had been kindly given shelter for the night in the\nkitchen below, and, having fulfilled their unvarying custom of chanting\ntheir morning hymn, they now ceased, and again composed themselves to\nsleep. But not so their auditor. There was to me something inexpressibly\nbeautiful in this morning song of praise from the untaught sons of the\nforest. What a lesson did it preach to the civilized, Christianized\nworld, too many of whom lie down and rise up without an aspiration of\nthanksgiving to their Almighty Preserver–without even a remembrance of\nHis care, who gives His angels charge concerning them! Never has the\nimpression of that simple act of worship faded from my mind. I have\nloved to think that, with some, these strains might be the outpouring of\na devotion as pure as that of the Christian when he utters the inspiring\nwords of the sainted Ken–",
        "“Awake, my soul! and with the sun,” etc.",
        "Among the visitors who called to offer me a welcome to the West, were\nMr. and Miss Cadle, who were earnestly engaged in the first steps of\ntheir afterwards flourishing enterprise for the education of Indian and\nhalf-breed children. The school-houses and chapel were not yet erected,\nbut we visited their proposed site, and listened with great interest to\nbright anticipations of the future good that was to be accomplished–the\nsuccess that was to crown their efforts for taming the heathen and\nteaching them the knowledge of their Saviour and the blessings of\ncivilized life. The sequel has shown how little the zeal of the few can\naccomplish, when opposed to the cupidity of the many.",
        "Our evening party went off as parties do elsewhere. The most interesting\nfeature to me, because the most novel, was the conversation of some\nyoung ladies to whom I was introduced, natives of Green Bay or its\nvicinity. Their mother was a Menomonee, but their father was a\nFrenchman, a descendant of a settler some generations back, and who,\nthere is reason to believe, was a branch of the same family of Grignon\nto which the daughter of Madame de Sévigné belonged. At least, it is\nsaid there are in the possession of the family many old papers and\nrecords which would give that impression, although the orthography of\nthe name has become slightly changed. Be that as it may, the Miss\nGrignons were strikingly dignified, well-bred young ladies, and there\nwas a charm about their soft voices, and original, unsophisticated\nremarks, very attractive to a stranger.",
        "They opened to me, however, a new field of apprehension; for, on my\nexpressing my great impatience to see my new home, they exclaimed, with\na look of wonder,–",
        "“Vous n’avez donc pas peur des serpens?”",
        "“Snakes! was it possible there were snakes at Fort Winnebago?”",
        "“At the Portage! oh! yes–one can never walk out for\nthem–rattle-snakes–copper-heads–all sorts!”",
        "I am not naturally timid, but I must confess that the idea of the\nserpens sonnettes and the siffleurs was not quite a subject of\nindifference.",
        "There was one among these young ladies whose tall, graceful figure,\nrich, blooming complexion, and dark, glancing eye, would have\ndistinguished her in any drawing-room–and another, whose gentle\nsweetness and cultivated taste made it a matter of universal regret that\nshe was afterwards led to adopt the seclusion of a convent.",
        "Captain Harney and his boat arrived in due time, and active preparations\nfar the comfort of our journey commenced under the kind supervision of\nMrs. Doty. The mess-basket was stowed with good things of every\ndescription–ham and tongue–biscuit and plum-cake–not to mention the\nsubstantiate of crackers, bread, and boiled pork, the latter of which,\nhowever, a lady was supposed to be too fastidious to think of touching,\neven if starving in the woods.",
        "We had engaged three Canadian voyageurs to take charge of our tent,\nmess-basket, and matters and things in general. Their business it was to\nbe to cut the wood for our fires, prepare our meals, and give a helping\nhand to whatever was going forward. A messenger had also been sent to\nthe Kakalin, or rapids, twenty-one miles above, to notify\nWish-tay-yun,[3] the most accomplished guide through the difficult\npasses of the river, to be in readiness for our service on a specified\nday.",
        "In the mean time, we had leisure for one more party, and it was to be a\n“real Western hop.” Everybody will remember that dance at Mrs. Baird’s.\nAll the people, young and old, that would be gathered throughout, or, as\nit was the fashion to express it, on Green Bay, were assembled. The\nyoung officers were up from Fort Howard, looking so smart in their\nuniforms–treasures of finery, long uncalled forth, were now brought to\nlight–everybody was bound to do honor to the strangers by appearing in\ntheir very best. It was to be an entertainment unequalled by any given\nbefore. All the house was put in requisition for the occasion. Desks and\nseats were unceremoniously dismissed from Mr. B.’s office, which formed\none wing, to afford more space for the dancers. Not only the front\nportion of the dwelling, but even the kitchen was made fit for the\nreception of company, in case any primitive visitor, as was sometimes\nthe case, should prefer sitting down quietly there and smoking his\ncigar. This was an emergency that, in those days, had always to be\nprovided for.",
        "Nothing could exceed the mirth and hilarity of the company. No\nrestraint, but of good manners–no excess of conventionalities–genuine,\nhearty good-humor and enjoyment, such as pleasant, hospitable people,\nwith just enough of the French element to add zest to anything like\namusement, could furnish, to make the entertainment agreeable. In a\ncountry so new, and where, in a social gathering, the number of the\ncompany was more important than the quality, the circle was not always,\nstrictly speaking, select.",
        "I was aware of this, and was therefore more amused than surprised when a\nclumsy little man, with a broad, red, laughing face, waddled across the\nroom to where I had taken my seat after a dance, and thus addressed me:",
        "“Miss K––, nobody hain’t never introduced you to me, but I’ve seen\nyou a good many times, and I know your husband very well, so I thought I\nmight just as well come and speak to you–my name is A––.”",
        "“Ah! Mr. A––, good-evening. I hope you are enjoying yourself. How is\nyour sister?”",
        "“Oh! she is a great deal worse–her cold has got into her eye, and it is\nall shot up.”",
        "Then turning full upon a lady[4] who sat near, radiant with youth and\nbeauty, sparkling with wit and genuine humor:",
        "“Oh! Mrs. Beall,” he began, “what a beautiful gown you have got on, and\nhow handsome you do look! I declare you’re the prettiest woman in the\nroom, and dance the handsomest.”",
        "“Indeed, Mr. A––,” replied she, suppressing her love of fun and\nassuming a demure look, “I am afraid you flatter me.”",
        "“No, I don’t–I’m in earnest. I’ve just come to ask you to dance.”",
        "Such was the penalty of being too charming.",
