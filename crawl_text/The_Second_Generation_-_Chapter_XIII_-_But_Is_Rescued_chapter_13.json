        "By the time he reached Saint X our young “man of affairs” believed his\nconscience soundly converted to his adventure; and, as he drove toward\nthe house, a final survey of his defenses and justifications satisfied\nhim that they were impregnable. Nevertheless, as he descended from the\nstation hack and entered the grounds of the place that in his heart of\nheart was all that the word “home” can contain, he felt strangely like a\ntraitor and a sneak. He kept his manner of composed seriousness, but he\nreasoned in vain against those qualms of shame and panic. At the open\nfront door he dared not lift his eyes lest he should be overwhelmed by\nthe sight of that colossal figure, with a look in its face that would\nforce him to see the truth about his thoughts and his acts. The house\nseemed deserted; on the veranda that opened out from the back parlor he\nfound Dory Hargrave, reading. He no longer felt bitter toward Dory.\nThinking over the whole of the Ranger-Whitney relations and the sudden\ndouble break in them, he had begun to believe that perhaps Adelaide had\nhad the good luck to make an extremely clever stroke when she shifted\nfrom Ross Whitney to Hargrave. Anyhow, Dory was a fine fellow, both in\nlooks and in brains, with surprisingly good, yes, really amazing air and\nmanner–considering his opportunities; he’d be an ornament to any family\nas soon as he had money enough properly to equip himself–which would be\nvery soon, now that the great Dawson was about to open fire on the will\nand demolish it.",
        "“Howdy,” he accordingly said, with only a shade less than his old\nfriendliness, and that due to embarrassment, and not at all to ill\nfeeling. “Where’s mother–and Del?”",
        "“Your sister has taken your mother for a drive,” replied Hargrave.",
        "“Smoke?” said Arthur, extending his gold cigarette case, open.",
        "Dory preferred his own brand of cigarettes; but, feeling that he ought to\nmeet any advance of Arthur’s, he took one of the big, powerful Egyptians\nwith “A.K.” on it in blue monogram. They smoked in silence a moment or\nso, Arthur considering whether to practise on Dory the story of his\nproposed contest, to enable him to tell it in better form to his mother\nand sister. “I’ve been to Chicago to see about contesting the will,” he\nbegan, deciding for the rehearsal.",
        "“I supposed so,” said Hargrave.",
        "“Of course, for mother’s and Del’s sake I simply have to do it,” he went\non, much encouraged. “Anyone who knew father knows he must have been out\nof his mind when he made that will.”",
        "“I see your point of view,” said Dory, embarrassed. Then, with an effort\nhe met Arthur’s eyes, but met them fearlessly. “You misunderstood me. I\nthink a contest is a mistake.”",
        "Arthur flamed. “Naturally you defend your father,” he sneered.",
        "“Let us leave my father out of this,” said Dory. His manner made it\nimpossible for Arthur to persist. For Dory was one of those who have\nthe look of “peace with honor” that keeps to bounds even the man\ncrazed by anger.",
        "“You can’t deny I have a legal right to make the contest,” pursued\nArthur.",
        "“Undoubtedly.”",
        "“And a moral right, too,” said Arthur, somewhat defiantly.",
        "“Yes,” assented Dory. The tone of the “yes\"–or was it Arthur’s own\nself-respect–made him suspect Dory of thinking that a man might have the\nclearest legal and moral right and still not be able to get his honor’s\nconsent. “But why discuss the matter, Arthur? You couldn’t be changed by\nanything I’d say.”",
        "“We will discuss it!” exclaimed Arthur furiously. “I see what your plan\nis. You know I’m bound to win; so you’ll try to influence Del and mother\nagainst me, and get the credit for taking high ground, and at the same\ntime get the benefit of the breaking of the will. When the will’s broken,\nmother’ll have her third; you think you can stir up a quarrel between her\nand me, and she’ll leave all of her third to Del and you.”",
        "Arthur had started up threateningly. There showed at his eyes and mouth\nthe ugliest of those alien passions which his associations had thrust\ninto him, and which had been master ever since the reading of the will.\nThe signs were all for storm; but Dory sat impassive. He looked steadily\nat Arthur until Arthur could no longer withstand, but had to drop his\neyes. Then he said: “I want you to think over what you have just said to\nme, Artie–especially your calculations on the death of your mother.”",
        "Arthur dropped back into his chair.",
        "“Honestly, Artie, honestly,” Dory went on, with the friendliest\nearnestness, “isn’t there something wrong about anything that causes the\nman you are by nature to think and feel and talk that way, when his\nfather is not a week dead?”",
        "Arthur forced a sneer, but without looking at Dory.",
        "“Do you remember the day of the funeral?” Dory went on. “It had been\nannounced in the papers that the burial would be private. As we drove out\nof the front gates there, I looked round–you remember it was raining.\nThere were uncovered farm wagons blocking the streets up and down. There\nwere thousands of people standing in the rain with bared heads. And I saw\ntears thick as the rain drops streaming down faces of those who had known\nyour father as boy and man, who had learned to know he was all that a\nhuman being should be.”",
        "Arthur turned away to hide his features from Dory.",
        "“That was your father, Artie. What if he could have heard you a few\nminutes ago?”",
        "“I don’t need to have anyone praise my father to me,” said Arthur,\ntrying to mask his feelings behind anger. “And what you say is no reason\nwhy I should let mother and Del and myself be cheated out of what he\nwanted us to have.”",
        "Dory left it to Arthur’s better self to discuss that point with him. “I\nknow you’ll do what is right,” said he sincerely. “You are more like\nyour father than you suspect as yet, Artie. I should have said nothing\nto you if you hadn’t forced your confidence on me. What I’ve said is\nonly what you’d say to me, were I in your place and you in mine–what\nyou’ll think yourself a month from now. What lawyer advised you to\nundertake the contest?”",
        "“Dawson of Mitchell, Dawson, Vance & Bischoffsheimer. As good lawyers as\nthere are in the country.”",
        "“I ought to tell you,” said Dory, after brief hesitation, “that Judge\nTorrey calls them a quartette of unscrupulous scoundrels–says they’re\nregarded as successful only because success has sunk to mean supremacy in\ncheating and double-dealing. Would you mind telling me what terms they\ngave you–about fee and expenses?”",
        "“A thousand down, and a note for five thousand,” replied Arthur,\ncompelled to speech by the misgivings Dory was raising within him in\nspite of himself.",
        "“That is, as the first installment, they take about all the money in\nsight. Does that look as if they believed in the contest?”",
        "At this Arthur remembered and understood Dawson’s remark, apparently\ncasual, but really crucial, about the necessity of attaching Dr. Schulze.\nWithout Schulze, he had no case; and Dawson had told him so! What kind of\na self-hypnotized fool was he, not to hear the plainest warnings? And\nwithout waiting to see Schulze, he had handed over his money!",
        "“I know you think I am not unprejudiced about this will,” Dory went on.\n“But I ask you to have a talk with Judge Torrey. While he made the will,\nit was at your father’s command, and he didn’t and doesn’t approve it. He\nknows all the circumstances. Before you go any further, wouldn’t it be\nwell to see him? You know there isn’t an abler lawyer, and you also know\nhe’s honest. If there’s any way of breaking the will, he’ll tell you\nabout it.”",
        "Hiram Ranger’s son now had the look of his real self emerging from the\nsubsiding fumes of his debauch of folly and fury. “Thank you, Hargrave,\"\nhe said. “You are right.”",
        "“Go straight off,” advised Dory. “Go before you’ve said anything to your\nmother about what you intend to do. And please let me say one thing more.\nSuppose you do finally decide to make this contest. It means a year, two\nyears, three years, perhaps five or six, perhaps ten or more, of\nsuspense, of degrading litigation, with the best of you shriveling, with\nyour abilities to do for yourself paralyzed. If you finally lose–you’ll\nowe those Chicago sharks an enormous sum of money, and you’ll be\nembittered and blighted for life. If you win, they and their pals will\nhave most of the estate; you will have little but the barren victory; and\nyou will have lost your mother. For, Arthur, if you try to prove that\nyour father was insane, and cut off his family in insane anger, you know\nit will kill her.”",
        "A long silence; then Arthur moved toward the steps leading down to the\ndrive. “I’ll think it over,” he said, in a tone very different from any\nhe had used before.",
        "Dory watched him depart with an expression of friendship and admiration.\n“He’s going to Judge Torrey,” he said to himself. “Scratch that veneer of\nhis, and you find his mother and father.”",
        "The old judge received Arthur like a son, listened sympathetically as the\nyoung man gave him in detail the interview with Dawson. Even as Arthur\nrecalled and related, he himself saw Dawson’s duplicity; for, that past\nmaster of craft had blundered into the commonest error of craft of all\ndegrees–he had underestimated the intelligence of the man he was trying\nto cozen. He, rough in dress and manners and regarding “dudishness” as\nunfailing proof of weak-mindedness, had set down the fashionable Arthur,\nwith his Harvard accent and his ignorance of affairs, as an unmitigated\nass. He had overlooked the excellent natural mind which false education\nand foolish associations had tricked out in the motley, bells and bauble\nof “culture\"; and so, he had taken no pains to cozen artistically. Also,\nas he thought greediness the strongest and hardiest passion in all human\nbeings, because it was so in himself, he had not the slightest fear that\nanyone or anything could deflect his client from pursuing the fortune\nwhich dangled, or seemed to dangle, tantalizingly near.",
        "Arthur, recalling the whole interview, was accurate where he had been\nvisionary, intelligent where he had been dazed. He saw it all, before he\nwas half done; he did not need Torrey’s ejaculated summary: “The\nswindling scoundrel!” to confirm him.",
        "“You signed the note?” said the judge.",
        "“Yes,” replied Arthur. He laughed with the frankness of self-derision\nthat augurs so well for a man’s teachableness.",
        "“He must have guessed,” continued the judge, “that a contest is useless.”",
        "At that last word Arthur changed expression, changed color–or, rather,\nlost all color. “Useless?” he repeated, so overwhelmed that he clean\nforgot pride of appearances and let his feelings have full play in his\nface. Useless! A contest useless. Then–",
        "“I did have some hopes,” interrupted Judge Torrey’s deliberate, judicial\ntones, “but I had to give them up after I talked with Schulze and\nPresident Hargrave. Your father may have been somewhat precipitate,\nArthur, but he was sane when he made that will. He believed his wealth\nwould be a curse to his children. And–I ain’t at all sure he wasn’t\nright. As I look round this town, this whole country, and see how the\nsecond generation of the rich is rotten with the money-cancer, I feel\nthat your grand, wise father had one of the visions that come only to\nthose who are about to leave the world and have their eyes cleared of the\ndust of the combat, and their minds cooled of its passions.” Here the old\nman leaned forward and laid his hand on the knee of the white, haggard\nyouth. “Arthur,” he went on, “your father’s mind may have been befogged\nby his affections in the years when he was letting his children do as\nthey pleased, do like most children of the rich. And his mind may have\nbeen befogged by his affections again, after he made that will and went\ndown into the Dark Valley. But, I tell you, boy, he was sane when he\nmade that will. He was saner than most men have the strength of mind to\nbe on the best day of their whole lives.”",
        "Arthur was sitting with elbows on the desk; his face stared out, somber\nand gaunt, from between his hands. “How much he favors his father,\"\nthought the old judge. “What a pity it don’t go any deeper than looks.\"\nBut the effect of the resemblance was sufficient to make it impossible\nfor him to offer any empty phrases of cheer and consolation. After a long\ntime the hopeless, dazed expression slowly faded from the young man’s\nface; in its place came a calm, inscrutable look. The irresponsible boy\nwas dead; the man had been born–in rancorous bitterness, but in strength\nand decision.",
        "It was the man who said, as he rose to depart, “I’ll write Dawson that\nI’ve decided to abandon the contest.”",
        "“Ask him to return the note,” advised Torrey. “But,” he added, “I doubt\nif he will.”",
        "“He won’t,” said Arthur. “And I’ll not ask him. Anyhow, a few dollars\nwould be of no use to me. I’d only prolong the agony of getting down to\nwhere I’ve got to go.”",
        "“Five thousand dollars is right smart of money,” protested the judge. “On\nsecond thought, I guess you’d better let me negotiate with him.” The old\nman’s eyes were sparkling with satisfaction in the phrases that were\nforming in his mind for the first letter to Dawson.",
        "“Thank you,” said Arthur. But it was evident that he was not\ninterested. “I must put the past behind me,” he went on presently. “I\nmustn’t think of it.”",
        "“After all,” suggested Torrey, “you’re not as bad off as more than\nninety-nine per cent of the young men. You’re just where they are–on bed\nrock. And you’ve got the advantage of your education.”",
        "Arthur smiled satirically. “The tools I learned to use at college,” said\nhe, “aren’t the tools for the Crusoe Island I’ve been cast away on.”",
        "“Well, I reckon a college don’t ruin a young chap with the right stuff in\nhim, even if it don’t do him any great sight of good.” He looked uneasily\nat Arthur, then began: “If you’d like to study law\"–as if he feared the\noffer would be accepted, should he make it outright.",
        "“No; thank you, I’ve another plan,” replied Arthur, though “plan” would\nhave seemed to Judge Torrey a pretentious name for the hazy possibilities\nthat were beginning to gather in the remote corners of his mind.",
        "“I supposed you wouldn’t care for the law,” said Torrey, relieved that\nhis faint hint of a possible offer had not got him into trouble. He liked\nArthur, but estimated him by his accent and his dress, and so thought him\nprobably handicapped out of the running by those years of training for a\ncareer of polite uselessness. “That East!” he said to himself, looking\npityingly at the big, stalwart youth in the elaborate fopperies of\nfashionable mourning. “That damned East! We send it most of our money\nand our best young men; and what do we get from it in return? Why, sneers\nand snob-ideas.” However, he tried to change his expression to one less\ndiscouraging; but his face could not wholly conceal his forebodings.\n“It’s lucky for the boy,” he reflected, “that Hiram left him a good home\nas long as his mother’s alive. After she’s gone–and the five thousand,\nif I get it back–I suppose he’ll drop down and down, and end by clerking\nit somewhere.” With a survey of Arthur’s fashionable attire, “I should\nsay he might do fairly well in a gent’s furnishing store in one of those\ndamn cities.” The old man was not unfeeling–far from it; he had simply\nbeen educated by long years of experience out of any disposition to\nexaggerate the unimportant in the facts of life. “He’ll be better off and\nmore useful as a clerk than he would be as a pattern of damnfoolishness\nand snobbishness. So, Hiram was right anyway I look at it, and no matter\nhow it comes out. But–it did take courage to make that will!”",
        "“Well, good day, judge,” Arthur was saying, to end both their reveries.\n“I must,” he laughed curtly, “’get a move on.’”",
        "“Good day, and God bless you, boy,” said the old man, with a hearty\nearnestness that, for the moment, made Arthur’s eyes less hard. “Take\nyour time, settling on what to do. Don’t be in a hurry.”",
        "“On the contrary,” said Arthur. “I’m going to make up my mind at once.\nNothing stales so quickly as a good resolution.”",
