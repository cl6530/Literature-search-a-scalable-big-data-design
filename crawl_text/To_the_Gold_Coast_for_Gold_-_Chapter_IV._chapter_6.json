        "MADEIRA (continued)–CHRISTMAS–SMALL INDUSTRIES–\nWINE–DEPARTURE FOR TENERIFE.",
        "The Christmas of 1881 at Madeira could by no means be called gay. The\nforeign colony was hospitable, as usual, with dinners, dances, and\nChristmas trees. But amongst the people festivities seemed to consist\nchiefly of promenading one’s best clothes about the military band and\nfiring royal salutes, not to speak of pistols and squibs. The noise\nreminded me of Natal amongst the Cairene Greeks; here, as in the Brazil,\nif you give a boy a copper he expends it not on lollipops, but on\nfireworks. We wished one another boas entradas, the ’buon’\nprincipio’ of Italy, and remembered the procession of seventeen years\nago. The life-sized figures, coarsely carved in wood and dressed in real\nclothes, were St. Francis, St. Antonio de Noto, a negro (Madeiran\nCatholics recognise no ’aristocracy of the skin’); a couple of married\nsaints (for even matrimony may be sanctified), SS. Bono and Luzia, with\nhalf a dozen others. The several platforms, carried by the brotherhoods\nin purple copes, were preceded by the clergy with banners and crosses\nand were followed by soldiers. The latter then consisted of a battalion\nof caçadores, 480 to 500 men, raised in the island and commanded\nby a colonel entitled ’Military Governor.’ They are small, dark figures\ncompared with the burly Portuguese artillerymen stationed at the Loo\nFort and São Thiago Battery, and they are armed with old English\nsniders.",
        "Behind the Tree of Penitence and the crosses of the orders came an Ecce\nHomo and a bit of the ’true Cross’ shaded by a canopy. The peasantry,\nwho crowded into town–they do so no longer–knelt to kiss whatever was\nkissable, and dodged up and down the back streets to gain\nopportunities. Even the higher ranks were afoot; they used to acquire in\ninfancy a relish for these mild amusements. And one thing is to be noted\nin favour of the processions; the taste of town-decoration was\nexcellent, and the combinations of floral colours were admirable.\nPerhaps there is too much of nosegay in Madeira, making us\nremember the line–",
        "  Posthume, non bene olet qui bane semper olet.",
        "I went to the Jesuit church to hear the predica, or sermon. The\npreacher does not part his hair ’amidships,’ or display cambric and\ndiamond-rings, yet his manner is none the less maniérée. For him\nand his order, in Portugal as in Spain, the strictest minutiae of\ndemeanour and deportment are laid down. The body should be borne\nupright, but not stuck up, and when the congregation is addressed the\nchest is slightly advanced. The dorsal region must never face the\nSacrament; this would be turning one’s back, as it were, upon the\nDeity. The elbow may not rest upon the cushion. The head, held erect,\nbut not haughtily, should move upon the atlas gently and suavely,\navoiding ’lightness’ and undue vivacity. The lips must not smile; but,\nwhen occasion calls for it, they may display a saintly joy. The eyebrows\nmust not be raised too high towards the hair-roots; nor should one be\nelevated while the other is depressed. The voice should be at times\ntremolando, and the tone periodically ’sing-song.’  Finally, the\neyes are ordered to wander indiscriminately, and with all pudicity, over\nthe whole flock, and never to be fixed upon a pretty lamb.",
        "Our countrymen are not over-popular in Portugal or in Madeira; such\nmortal insults as those offered by Byron, to name only the corypheus,\nwill rankle and can never be forgotten. In this island strangers,\nespecially Englishmen, have a bad practice of not calling upon the two\ngovernors, civil and military. The former, Visconde de Villa Mendo, is\nexceptional; he likes England and the English. As a rule the highest\nclasses mix well with strangers; not so the medio ceto who, under\na constitutional régime, rule the roast. Men with small fixed\nincomes have little to thank us for; we make things dear, and we benefit\nonly the working men. Bourgeois exactions have driven both French ships\nand American whalers to Tenerife; and many of them would do the same\nwith the English and German residents and visitors of Funchal. Not a few\nhave noble and historic names, whose owners are fallen into extreme\npoverty. Professor Azevedo’s book is also a nobiliaire de\nMadère. The last generation used to be remarkably prim and precise,\nin dress as in language and manner. They never spoke of ’hogs’ or\n’horns,’ and they wore the skimpy waistcoats and the regulation whiskers\nof Wellington’s day. The fair sex appeared only at ’functions,’ at\nchurch, and at the Sunday promenade in the Place. The moderns dress\nbetter than their parents, who affected the most violent colours, an\nexceedingly pink pink upon a remarkably green green; and the shape of\nthe garment was an obsolete caricature of London and Paris. They no\nlonger assume the peculiar waddle, looking as if the lower limbs were\nunequal to the weight of the upper story; but the walk never equals that\nof the Spanish woman. This applies to Portugal as well. The strong\npoints, here as in the Peninsula, are velvety black eyes and blue-black\nhair dressed à la Diane. It is still the fashion, as at Lisbon,\nto look somewhat boudeuse when abroad, by way of hint that man\nmust not expect too much; yet these cross faces at home or with\nintimates are those of bonnes enfants. Lastly, the dark\ncomplexions and the irregular features do not contrast well with the\ncharming faces and figures of Tenerife, who mingle the beauty of\nGuanchedom with that of Spain and Ireland.",
        "The list of public amusements at Funchal is not extensive. Years ago the\ntheatre was converted into a grain-store, and now it is a\nwine-store. The circus of lumber has been transferred from under the\nPeak Fort to near the sea; it mostly lacks men and horses. The Germans\nhave a tolerable lending library; and the public bibliotheca in\nthe Town House, near the Jesuit church, is rich in old volumes, mostly\ncollected from religious houses. In 1851 the books numbered 1,800; now\nthey may be 2,000; kept neat and clean in two rooms of the fine solid\nold building. Of course the collection is somewhat mixed, Fox’s\n’Martyrs’ and the ’Lives of the Saints’ standing peacefully near the\n’Encyclopédie’ and Voltaire. A catalogue can hardly be expected.",
        "There are three Masonic lodges and two Portuguese clubs, one good, the\nother not; and the former (Club Funchalense), well lodged in a house\nbelonging to Viscountess Torre Bella, gives some twice or three times a\nyear very enjoyable balls. The Café Central, with estaminet and\nFrench billiard-table, is much frequented by the youth of the town, but\nnot by residents. The great institution is the club called the ’English\nRooms,’ which has been removed from over a shop in the Aljube to\nViscondessa de Torre Bella’s house in the Rua da Alfandega. The British\nConsulate is under the same roof, and next door is Messieurs Blandy’s\nubiquitous ’Steamer Agency.’ The roomy and comfortable quarters, with a\nfine covered balcony looking out upon the sea, are open to both\nsexes. The collection of books is old; but the sum of 100l. laid\nout on works of reference would bring it fairly up to the level of the\naverage English country-club. Strangers’ names were hospitably put down\nby any proprietary member as guests and visitors if they did not outstay\nthe fortnight; otherwise they became subscribers. But crowding was the\nresult, and the term has been reduced to three days: a month’s\nsubscription, however, costs only 10s. 6d. The doors close\nat 7.30 P.M.: I used to think this an old-world custom kept up by the\nveteran hands; but in an invalid place perhaps it is wisely done.",
        "The principal passetemps at Madeira consists of eating, drinking,\nand smoking; it is the life of a horse in a loose box, where the animal\neats pour passer le temps. After early tea and toast there is\nbreakfast à la fourchette at nine; an equally heavy lunch, or rather\nan early dinner (No. 1), appears at 1 to 2 P.M.; afternoon tea follows,\nand a second dinner at 6 to 7. Residents and invalids suppress tiffin\nand dine at 2 to 3 P.M. In fact, as on board ship, people eat because\nthey have nothing else to do; and English life does not admit of the\nsensible French hours–déjeuner à la fourchette at 11 A.M. and\ndinner after sunset.",
        "The first walk through Funchal shows that it has not improved during the\nlast score of years, and to be stationary in these days is equivalent to\nbeing retrograde. It received two heavy blows–in 1852 the vine-disease;\nand, since that time, a gradual decline of reputation as a\nsanatorium. Yet it may, I think, look for a better future when the Land\nBill Law system, extending to England and Scotland, will cover the\ncontinent with colonies of British rentiers who rejoice in large\nfamilies and small incomes. Moreover, Anglo-African officials are\ngradually learning that it is best to leave their ’wives and wees’ at\nMadeira; and the coming mines of the Gold Coast will greatly add to the\nnumbers. For the economist Funchal and its environs present peculiar\nadvantages. The dearness of coin appears in the cheapness of houses and\npremises. Estates which cost 5,000l. to 15,000l. a generation\nago have been sold to ’Demerarists’ for one-tenth that\nsum. ’Palmeira,’ for instance, was built for 42,000l., and was\nbought for 4,000l. A family can live quietly, even keeping\nponies, for 500l. per annum; and it is something to find a place\nfour to seven days’ sail from England inhabitable, to a certain extent\nall the year round. The mean annual temperature is 67.3 degrees; that of\nsummer varies from 70 degrees to 85 degrees, and in winter it rarely\nfalls below 50 degrees to 60 degrees. The range, which is the most\nimportant consideration, averages 9 degrees, with extremes of 5 degrees\nto 35 degrees. The moist heat is admirably adapted for old age, and I\ndoubt not that it greatly prolongs life. Youth, English youth, cannot\nthrive in this subtropical air; there are certain advantages for\neducation at Funchal; but children are sent north, as from Anglo-India,\nto be reared. Otherwise they will grow up yellow and languid, without\nenergy or industry, and with no object in life but to live.",
        "Madeira has at once gained credit for comfort and has lost reputation as\na sanatorium, a subject upon which fashion is peculiarly fickle. During\nthe last century the Faculty sent its incurables to Lisbon and\nMontpellier despite the mistral and the fatal vent de\nbise. The latter town then lodged some 300 English families of\ninvalids, presently reduced to a few economists and wine-merchants.\nSucceeded Nice and Pisa, one of the most wearying and relaxing\nof ’sick bays;’ and Pau in the Pyrenees, of which the native\nBéarnais said that the year has eight months of winter and four of\ninferno. Madeira then rose in the world, and a host of medical residents\nsounded her praises, till Mentone was written up and proved a powerful\nrival. And the climate of the hot-damp category was found to suit,\nmainly if not only, that tubercular cachexy and those, bronchial\naffections and lung-lesions in which the viscus would suffer from the\nover-excitement of an exceedingly dry air like the light invigorating\nmedium of Tenerife or Thebes. Lastly, when phthisis was determined to be\na disease of debility, of anæmia, of organic exhaustion, and of\ndefective nutrition, cases fitted for Madeira were greatly limited. Here\ninstruments deceive us as to humidity. The exceeding dampness is shown\nby the rusting of iron and the tarnishing of steel almost as effectually\nas upon the West African coast. Yet Mr. Vivian’s observations, assuming\n100 to be saturation, made Torquay 76 and Funchal 73. [Footnote: Others\nmake the mean humidity of Funchal 76, and remark that in the healthiest\nand most pleasant climates the figures range between 70 and\n80]. Moreover it was found out that consumption, as well as intermittent\nfevers, are common on the island, so common, indeed, as to require an\nespecial hospital for the poorer classes, although the people declare\nthem to have been imported by the stranger. I may here observe that\nwhile amongst all the nations of Southern Europe great precautions are\ntaken against the contagion of true phthisis, English medicos seem to\nignore it. A Pisan housekeeper will even repaper the rooms after the\ndeath of a consumptive patient. At Funchal sufferers in every stage of\nthe disease live in the same house and even in the same rooms.",
        "Then came the discovery that for consumptives dry cold is a medium\nsuperior to damp heat. Invalids were sent to the Tyrol, to the Engadine,\nto Canada, and even to Iceland, where phthisis is absolutely unknown,\nand where a diet of oleaginous fish is like feeding upon cod-liver or\nshark-liver oil. The air as well as the diet proved a tonic, and\npatients escaped the frequent cough, catarrh, influenza, and neuralgia\nwhich are so troublesome at Funchal. Here, too, the invalid must be\naccompanied by a ’prudent and watchful friend,’ or friends, and the\ncompanions will surely suffer. I know few climates so bad and none worse\nfor those fecund causes of suffering in Europe, liver-affections\n(’mucous fevers’), diarrhoeas, and dysenteries; for nervous complaints,\ntic douloureux, and neuralgia, or for rheumatism and lumbago. Asthma is\none of the disorders which shows the most peculiar forms, and must be\ntreated in the most various ways: here some sufferers are benefitted,\nothers are not. Madeira is reputedly dangerous also for typhoid\naffections, for paralysis, and for apoplexy. There is still another\nchange to come. The valley north of the beautiful and ever maligned\n’Dead Sea’ of Palestine, where the old Knights Templar had their\nsugar-mills and indigo-manufactories, has peculiar merits. Lying some\n1,350 feet below the Mediterranean, it enables a man to live with a\nquarter of a lung: you may run till your legs fail with fatigue, but you\ncan no more get out of breath than you can sink in the saline waters of\nLake Asphaltites. When a railway from Jafa to Jerusalem shall civilise\nthe ’Holy Land,’ I expect great things from the sites about the Jordan\nembouchure.",
        "After the ’gadding vine’ had disappeared the people returned to their\nold amours, the sugar-cane, whose five loaves, disposed crosswise, gave\nthe island her heraldic cognisance. Madeira first cultivated sugar in\nthe western hemisphere and passed it on to the New World. Yet the cane\nwas always worked under difficulties. Space is limited: the upper\nextreme of cultivation on the southern side may be estimated at 1,000\nfeet. The crop exhausts the soil; the plant requires water, and it\ndemands what it can rarely obtain in quantity–manure. Again, machinery\nis expensive and adventure is small. Jamaica and her slave-labour soon\nreduced the mills from one hundred and fifty to three, and now five. My\nhospitable friend, Mr. William Hinton, is the only islander who works\nsugar successfully at the Torreão. The large rival mill with the\ntall regulation smoke-stack near the left mouth of the Ribeira de São’\nJoão, though inscribed ’Omnia vincit improbus labor,’ and though\nprovided with the most expensive modern appliances, is understood not to\nbe a success for the Companhia Fabril d’Assucar.",
        "Here sugar-working in the present day requires for bare existence high\nprotective duties. The Government, however, has had the common sense,\nand the Madeirans patriotic feeling enough, to defend their industry\nfrom certain ruinous vagaries, by taxing imported growths 80 reis\n(4d.) per kilo. A hard-grit free-trader would abolish this\nabomination and ruin half the island. And here I would remark that in\nEngland the world has seen for the first time a wealthy and commercial,\na great and generous nation proclaim, and take pride in proclaiming, the\nmost immoral doctrine. ’Free Trade,’ so called, I presume, because it is\npractically the reverse of free or fair trade, openly abjures public\nspirit and the chief obligation of the citizen–to think of his\nneighbour as well as himself, and not to let charity end, as it often\nbegins, at home. ’Buy cheap and sell dear’ is the law delivered by its\nprophets, the whole duty of ’the merchant and the man.’ When its\ntheorists ask me the favourite question, ’Would you not buy in the\ncheapest market?’ I reply, ’Yes, but my idea of cheapness is not yours:\nI want the best, no matter what its price, because it will prove\ncheapest in the end.’ How long these Free-trade fads and fooleries will\nlast no one can say; but they can hardly endure till that millennium\nwhen the world accepts the doctrine, and when Free Trade becomes free\ntrade and fair trade.",
        "As regards petite industrie in Madeira, there is a considerable\ntraffic in ’products of native industry,’ sold to steamer-passengers.\nThe list gives jewellery and marquetry or inlaid woodwork;\nfeather-flowers, straw hats, lace and embroidery, the latter an\nimportant item; boots and shoes of unblackened leather; sweetmeats,\nespecially guava-cheese; wax-fruits, soap-berry bracelets, and ’Job’s\ntears;’ costumes in wood and clay; basketry, and the well-known wicker\nchairs, tables, and sofas. The cooperage is admirable; I have nowhere\nseen better-made casks. The handsomest shops, as we might expect, are\nthe apothecaries’; and, here, as elsewhere, they thrive by charging a\nsixpence for what cost them a halfpenny.",
        "An enterprising Englishman lately imported sheep from home. The native\nmutton was described in 1842 as ’strong in flavour and lean in\ncondition;’ in fact, very little superior to that of Trieste. Now it is\nremarkably good, and will be better. Silk, I have said, has not been\nfairly tried, and the same is the case with ginger. Cotton suffered\nterribly from the worm. Chinchona propagated from cuttings, not from the\nseed, did well. Dr. Grabham [Footnote: The Climate and Resources of\nMadeira. By Michael C. Grabham, M.D., F.R.G.S., F.R.C.P. London;\nChurchill, 1870.] tells us that the coffee-berry ripens and yields a\nbeverage locally thought superior to that of the imported kinds. It has\nbecome almost extinct in consequence of protracted blights: the island\nair is far too damp. Tea did not succeed. [Footnote: Page 189, Du\nClimat de Madère, etc., par C. A. Mourão Pitta, Montpellier, 1859.]\nCochineal also proved a failure. The true Mexican cactus (Opuntia\nTuna) was brought to supplant the tree-like and lean-leafed native\ngrowth; but there is too much wind and rain for the insects, and the\npeople prefer to eat the figs or ’prickly pears.’ Bananas grow well, and\na large quantity is now exported for the English market. But the climate\ndoes not agree with European fruits and vegetables; strawberries and\nFrench beans are equally flavourless. I remarked the same in the\nglorious valley of the Lower Congo: it must result from some telluric or\natmospheric condition which we cannot yet appreciate.",
        "Tobacco has been tried with some success, though the results do not\nequal those of the Canaries; there, however, the atmosphere is too dry,\nhere it is not. The estanco (monopoly) and the chronic debt to\nthose who farm the import-tax long compelled the public to pay dear for\na poor article. Home-growth was forbidden till late years; now it is\nencouraged, and rate-payers contribute a small additional sum. Hitherto,\nhowever, results have not been over-favourable, because, I believe, the\ntobacco-beds have been unhappily placed. Rich valley-soils and\nsea-slopes, as at Cuban Vuelta de Abajo and Syrian Latakia, are the\nproper habitats of the ’holy herb.’ Here it is planted in the high dry\ngrounds about the ’Peak Fort’ and the uplands east of the city. Manure\nalso is rare and dear, and so is water, which, by the by, is sadly\nwasted in Madeira for want of reservoirs. Consequently the peasants\nsmoke tobacco from the Azores.",
        "The Casa Funchalense, north of the Cathedral, is the chief depôt for\nisland-growths. It sells ’Escuros’ (dark brands) of 20 reis, or\n1d., and 50 reis, according to size. The ’Claros,’ which seem to\nbe the same leaf steamed, fetch from 40 to 100 reis. A small half-ounce\nof very weak and poor-flavoured pipe-tobacco also is worth 1d.",
        "An influential planter, Senhor João de Salles Caldeira, kindly sent to\nMr. John Blandy some specimens of his nicotiana for me to test in\nAfrica. The leaf-tobaccos, all grown between 1879 and 1881, at Magdalena\nin the parish of St. Antonio, were of three kinds. The Havano was far\ntoo short for the trade; the Bahiano, also dark, was longer; and the\nso-called ’North-American’ was still longer, light-coloured and well\ntied in prick-shape. The negro verdict was, ’Left, a lilly he be foine,’\nmeaning they want but little to be excellent. The Gold Coast prefers\nyellow Virginia, whose invoice price is 7d. per lb. The traders\nare now introducing Kentucky, which, landed from Yankee ships, costs\n6d. But, here as elsewhere, it is difficult to bring about any\nsuch change.",
        "There were two qualities of Madeiran charutos (cigars): one long\nClaro which smoked very mild, and a short Escuro, which tasted a trifle\nbitter. The blacks complained that they were too new; and I should rank\nthem with the average produce of Brazilian Bahia. A papered\ncigarilha, clad in an outer leaf of tobacco, was exceptionally\ngood. The cígarros (cigarettes), neatly bound in bundles of\ntwenty-five, were of three kinds, fortes (strong),\nentre-fortes, and fracos (mild). All were excellent and\nfull of flavour; they did not sicken during the voyage, and I should\nrank them with the far-famed Bragança of the Brazil.",
        "The most successful of these small speculations is that of\nMr. E. Hollway. Assisted by an able gardener from Saint Michael, Azores,\nwhere the pineapple made a little fortune for Ponta Delgada, he has\nconverted Mount Pleasant, his father’s house and grounds on the Caminho\ndo Meio, into one huge pinery. The Madeiran sun does all the work of\nEnglish fires and flues; but the glass must be whitewashed; otherwise,\nbeing badly made, with bubbles and flaws, it would burn holes in the\nplants. The best temperature for the hot-houses is about 90° F.: it will\nrise after midday to 140°, and fall at night to 65°. The species\npreferred are, in order of merit, the Cayena, the black Jamaica, and the\nBrazilian Abacaxi. The largest of Mr. Hollway’s produce weighed 20\nlbs.–pumpkin size. Those of 12 lbs. and 15 lbs. are common, but the\nmarket prefers 8 lbs. His highest price was 2l., and he easily\nobtains from 10s. to 15s. In one greenhouse we saw 2,500\nplants potted and bedded; the total numbers more than double that\nfigure. The proprietor has a steam-saw, makes his own boxes, and packs\nhis pines with dry leaves of maize and plantain. He is also cultivating\na dwarf banana, too short to be wind-wrung. His ground will grow\nanything: the wild asparagus, which in Istria rises knee-high, here\nbecomes a tall woody shrub.",
        "And now of the wine which once delighted the world, and which has not\nyet become ’food for the antiquary.’ To begin with, a few dates and\nfigures are necessary. In 1852, that terrible year for France, the\nOïdium fungus attacked the vine, and soon reduced to 2,000 the normal\nyearly production of 20,000 and even 22,000 pipes.",
        "[Footnote: Between 1792 and 1827 the yearly average was 20,000.\nIn 1813 it was 22,000.\n “ 1814   “    14,000.\n “ 1816   “    15,000.",
        "In 1816 it was 12,000.\n “ 1818   “    18,000.\n “ 1825   “    14,000.",
        "It then decreased to an average of 7,000 till the oïdium-year\n(Miss E. M, Taylor, p. 74).]",
        "The finest growths suffered first, as animals of the highest blood\nsuccumb the soonest to epidemics. When I wrote in 1863 the grape was\nbeing replanted, chiefly the white verdelho, the Tuscan\nverdea. In 1873 the devastating Phylloxera appeared, and before\n1881 it had ruined two of the finest southern districts. The following\nnumerals show the rapid decline of yield:–6,000 pipes in 1878, 5,000 in\n1879, 3,000 in 1880, and 2,000 in 1881. There are still in store some\n30,000 pipes, each=92 gallons (forty-five dozen); and a single firm,\nMessrs. Blandy Brothers, own 3,000. Mr. Charles R. Blandy, the late head\nof the house, bought up all the must grown since 1863; but he did\nnot care to sell. This did much harm to the trade, by baulking the\ndemand and by teaching the public to do without it. His two surviving\nsons have worked hard and advertised on a large scale; they issue a\nyearly circular, and the result is improved enquiry. Till late years the\nworld was not aware that the Madeiran vine has again produced Madeira\nwine; and a Dutch admiral, amongst others, was surprised to hear that\nall was not made at Cettes. I give below Messrs. Blandy’s trade-prices,\nto which some 20 per cent, must be added for retail.",
        "[Footnote: Sound light medium Madeiras from 26s. to 32s. per dozen,\npacked and delivered in London; light, golden, delicate, 36s.;\ntawny Tinta, also called ’Madeira Burgundy,’ a red wine mixing well with\nwater, 40s.; fine old dry Verdelho, 48s.; rich soft old\nBual, not unlike Amontillado, 54s.; very fine dry old Sercial\n(the Riesling grape), 56s.; and the same for highly-flavoured\nsoft old Malmsey, ’Malvasia Candida,’ corrupted from ’Candia’ because\nsupposed to have been imported from that island in 1445. ’Grand Old Oama\nde Lobos’ is worth 70s., and the best Old Preserve wine\n86s. For wines very old in bottle there are special quotations.]",
        "The lowest price free on board is 23l, and the values rise from\n40l. at four years old to 1OOl. at ten years old.",
        "’Madeira’ was most popular in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,\nespecially at the Court of Francois I. Shakespeare in ’Henry IV.’  makes\ndrouthy Jack sell his soul on Good Friday for a cup of Madeira and a\ncold capon’s leg. Mr. H. Vizetelly, whose professional work should be\nread by all who would master the subject, marvels why and how this\n’magnificent wine’ went out of fashion. The causes are many, all easy to\ntrace. Men not yet very old remember the day when England had no vino\nde pasto fit to be drunk at meals; when they found only ports,\nsherries, and loaded clarets; and when they sighed in vain for light\nRhine or Bordeaux growths, good ordinaire being to drink what\nbread is to food.",
        "[Footnote: This, however, is a mere individual opinion. I have lately\nread a book recommending strong and well-brandied wines as preventing\nthe crave for pure alcohol.]",
        "Now, however, the national taste has changed; the supply of Madeira not\nsufficing for the demand, the class called boticarios\n(apothecaries) brought rivals into the market; and extensive imitation’s\nwith apples, loquats (Japanese medlars), and other frauds, brandied to\nmake the stuff keep, plastered or doctored with Paris-plaster to correct\nover-acidity, and coloured and sweetened with burnt sugar and with\nboiled ’must’ (mosto) to mock the Madeira flavour, gave the\nisland-produce a bad name. Again, the revolution in the wine-trade of\n1860-61 brought with it certain Continental ideas. In France a glass of\nMadeira follows soup, and in Austria it is drunk in liqueur-glasses like\nTokay.",
        "[Footnote: ’Madeira’ is the island modification of the Cyprus and the\nCandia (?) grape. ’Tokay’ comes from the Languedoc muscatel, and\n’Constantia’ from Burgundy, like most of the Rhine-wines.]",
        "The island wine must change once more to suit public taste. At present\nit ships at the average strength of 18°-25° per cent, of ’proof spirit,’\nwhich consists of alcohol and water in equal proportions. For that\npurpose each pipe is dosed with a gallon or two of Porto Santo or São\nVicente brandy. This can do no harm; the addition is homogeneous and\nchemically combines with the grape-juice; but when potato-spirit and\ncane-rum are substituted for alcohol distilled from wine, the result is\nbad. The vintage is rarely ripened by time, whose unrivalled work is\nimperfectly done in the estufa or flue-stove, the old fumarium,\nor in the sertio (apotheca), an attic whose glass roofing admits\nthe sun. The voyage to the East Indies was a clumsy contrivance for the\nsame purpose; and now the merchants are beginning to destroy the germs\nof fermentation not by mere heat, but by the strainer extensively used\nin Jerez. The press shown to me was one of Messrs. Johnson and Co.,\nwhich passes the liquor through eighteen thick cottons supported by iron\nplates. It might be worth while to apply electricity in the form used to\ndestroy fusel-oil. Lastly, the wine made for the market is a brand or a\nblend, not a ’vintage-wine.’  At any of the armazems, or stores,\nyou can taste the wines of ’70, ’75, ’76, and so forth, of A 1 quality;\nand you can learn their place as well as their date of birth. But these\nare mixed when wine of a particular kind is required and the produce\nbecomes artificial. What is now wanted is a thin light wine, red or\nwhite, with the Madeira flavour, and this will be the drink of the\nfuture. The now-forgotten tisane de Madère and the ’rain-water\nMadeira,’ made for the American markets, a soft, delicate, and\nstraw-coloured beverage, must be the models.",
        "I sampled the new wines carefully; and, with due remembrance of the\npeaches in ’Gil Blas,’ I came to the conclusion that they are no longer\nwhat they were. The wine is tainted with sulphur in its odorous union\nwith hydrogen. It is unduly saccharine, fermenting irregularly and\ninsufficiently. For years the plant has constantly been treated against\noidium with antiseptics, which destroy the spores and germ-growths; and\nwe can hardly expect a first-rate yield from a chronically-diseased\nstock. Still the drink is rich and highly flavoured; and, under many\ncircumstances, it answers better than any kind of sherry. No more\nsatisfactory refreshment on a small scale than a biscuit and a glass of\nBual. Moreover, the palate requires variety, and here finds it in a\nharmless form. But as a daily drink Madeira should be avoided: even in\nthe island I should prefer French Bordeaux, not English claret, with an\noccasional change to Burgundy. Meanwhile, ’London particular’ is a fact,\nand the supply will probably exceed the demand of the present\ngeneration.",
        "I also carefully sampled the wines of the north coast, which had not, as\nin Funchal, been subjected to doctoring by stove, by spirits, and by\nblend. They are lighter than the southern; but, if unbrandied, some soon\nturn sour, and others by keeping get strong and heady. The proportion of\nalcoholism is peremptorily determined by climate–that is, the\ncomparative ratio of sun and rain. In Europe, for instance, light wines\ncannot be produced without ’liquor,’ as the trade calls aqua\npura, by latitudes lower than Germany and Southern France. When heat\ngreatly exceeds moisture, the wines may be mild to mouth and nose, yet\nthey are exceedingly potent; witness the vino d’oro of the\nLibanus.",
        "At Funchal I also tasted a very neat wine, a vin de pays with the\nisland flavour and not old enough to become spirituous. If the vine be\nagain grown in these parts, its produce will be drunk in England under\nsome such form. But Madeira has at last found her ’manifest destiny:’\nshe will be an orchard to Northern Europe and (like the England of the\nfuture) a kitchen-garden to the West African Coast, especially the Gold\nMines.",
        "My sojourn at the Isle of Wood and its ’lotus-eating’ (which means\ndouble dinners) came to an end on Sunday, January 8, the\ns.s. Senegal Captain W. L. Keene, bringing my long-expected\nfriend Cameron, of African fame. The last day passed pleasantly enough\nin introducing him to various admirers; and we ate at Santa Clara a\nfinal dinner, perfectly conscious that we were not likely to see its\nlike for many a month. We were followed to the beach by a choice band of\nwell-wishers–Baron Adelin de Vercour, Colonel H. W. Keays Young, and\nDr. Struthers–who determined upon accompanying us to Tenerife. The\nnight was black as it well could be, and the white surf rattled the\nclicking pebbles, as we climbed into the shore-boat with broad\ncheek-pieces, and were pulled off shipwards. On board we found\nMr. William Reid, junior, who had carefully lodged our numerous\nimpediments; and, at 10 P.M., we weighed for Tenerife.",
        "I must not leave the Isle of Wood, which has so often given me\nhospitality, without expressing a hearty wish that the Portuguese\n’Government,’ now rhyming with ’impediment,’ will do its duty by\nher. The Canaries and their free ports, which are different from ’free\ntrade,’ have set the best example; and they have made great progress\nwhile the Madeiras have stood still, or rather have retrograded. The\nFunchal custom-house is a pest; the import charges are so excessive that\nvisitors never import, and for landing a single parcel the ship must pay\nhigh port-charges where no port exists. The population is heavily taxed,\nand would willingly ’pronounce’ if it could only find a head. The\nproduce, instead of being spent upon the island, is transmitted to\nLisbon: surely a portion of it might be diverted from bureaucratic\npockets and converted into an emigration fund. It is sad to think that a\nsingle stroke of the Ministerial pen would set all right and give new\nlife to the lovely island, and yet that the pen remains idle.",
        "And a parting word of praise for Madeira. Whatever the traveller from\nEurope may think of this quasi-tropical Tyrol, those homeward-bound from\nAsia and Africa will pronounce her a Paradise. They will enjoy good\nhotels, comfortable tables d’hôte, and beef that does not\nresemble horseflesh or unsalted junk. Nor is there any better place\nwherein to rest and recruit after hard service in the tropics. Moreover,\nat the end of a month spent in perfect repose the visitor will look\nforward with a manner of dismay to the plunge into excited civilised\nlife.",
        "But Madeira is not ’played out;’ au contraire, she is one of\nthose ’obligatory points’ for commerce which cannot but prosper as the\nworld progresses. The increasing traffic of the West African coast will\nmake men resort to her for comforts and luxuries, for climate and\nrepose. And when the Gold Mines shall be worked as they should be this\nisland may fairly look forward to catch many a drop of the golden\nshower.",
        "The following interesting table, given to me by M. d’Oliveira, clerk of\nthe English Rooms, shows what movement is already the rule of Funchal.",
