        "I have tendered my resignation to the court. I hope it will be\naccepted, and you will forgive me for not having previously consulted\nyou. It is necessary I should leave this place. I know all you\nwill urge me to stay, and therefore I beg you will soften this\nnews to my mother. I am unable to do anything for myself: how,\nthen, should I be competent to assist others? It will afflict her\nthat I should have interrupted that career which would have made\nme first a privy councillor, and then minister, and that I should\nlook behind me, in place of advancing. Argue as you will, combine\nall the reasons which should have induced me to remain, I am going:\nthat is sufficient. But, that you may not be ignorant of my\ndestination, I may mention that the Prince of — is here. He is\nmuch pleased with my company; and, having heard of my intention\nto resign, he has invited me to his country house, to pass the\nspring months with him. I shall be left completely my own master;\nand, as we agree on all subjects but one, I shall try my fortune,\nand accompany him.",
