        "Patriotism, or love of country, is one of the tests of nobility of\ncharacter. No great man ever lived that was not a patriot in the\nhighest and truest sense. From the earliest times, the sentiment of\npatriotism has been aroused in the hearts of men by the narrative of\nheroic deeds inspired by love of country and love of liberty. This\ntruth furnishes the key to the arrangement and method of the present\nwork. The ten epochs treated are those that have been potential in\nshaping subsequent events; and when men have struck blows for human\nliberty against odds and regardless of personal consequences. The\nsimple narrative carries its own morals, and the most profitable work\nfor the teacher will be to merely supplement the narrative so that the\npicture presented shall be all the more vivid. Moral reflections are\nwearisome and superfluous.",
