        "STATELY, PLUMP BUCK MULLIGAN CAME FROM THE STAIRHEAD, bearing a bowl of\nlather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown,\nungirdled, was sustained gently behind him by the mild morning air. He\nheld the bowl aloft and intoned:",
        "–Introibo Ad Altare Dei.",
        "Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:",
        "–Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!",
        "Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about\nand blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the\nawaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent\ntowards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and\nshaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms\non the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling\nface that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured\nhair, grained and hued like pale oak.",
        "Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered\nthe bowl smartly.",
        "–Back to barracks! he said sternly.",
        "He added in a preacher’s tone:",
        "–For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and\nblood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. A\nlittle trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.",
        "He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused\nawhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there\nwith gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answered\nthrough the calm.",
        "–Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off the\ncurrent, will you?",
        "He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering\nabout his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and\nsullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages. A\npleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.",
        "–The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!",
        "He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,\nlaughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily\nhalfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he\npropped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and\nlathered cheeks and neck.",
        "Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.",
        "–My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a\nHellenic ring, hasn’t it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We\nmust go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty\nquid?",
        "He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:",
        "–Will he come? The jejune jesuit!",
        "Ceasing, he began to shave with care.",
        "–Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.",
        "–Yes, my love?",
        "–How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?",
        "Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.",
        "–God, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks\nyou’re not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money\nand indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you\nhave the real Oxford manner. He can’t make you out. O, my name for you is\nthe best: Kinch, the knife-blade.",
        "He shaved warily over his chin.",
        "–He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is\nhis guncase?",
        "–A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?",
        "–I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark\nwith a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a\nblack panther. You saved men from drowning. I’m not a hero, however. If\nhe stays on here I am off.",
        "Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down\nfrom his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.",
        "–Scutter! he cried thickly.",
        "He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper\npocket, said:",
        "–Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.",
        "Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a\ndirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.\nThen, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:",
        "–The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.\nYou can almost taste it, can’t you?",
        "He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair\noakpale hair stirring slightly.",
        "–God! he said quietly. Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet\nmother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. EPI OINOPA PONTON.\nAh, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them in the\noriginal. THALATTA! THALATTA! She is our great sweet mother. Come and\nlook.",
        "Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked\ndown on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of\nKingstown.",
        "–Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.",
        "He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s\nface.",
        "–The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That’s why she won’t\nlet me have anything to do with you.",
        "–Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.",
        "–You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked\nyou, Buck Mulligan said. I’m hyperborean as much as you. But to think of\nyour mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for\nher. And you refused. There is something sinister in you ...",
        "He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant\nsmile curled his lips.",
        "–But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest\nmummer of them all!",
        "He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.",
        "Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against\nhis brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.\nPain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently, in\na dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its\nloose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her\nbreath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of\nwetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a\ngreat sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay and\nskyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had stood\nbeside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up\nfrom her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.",
        "Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.",
        "–Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt and\na few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?",
        "–They fit well enough, Stephen answered.",
        "Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.",
        "–The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God\nknows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair\nstripe, grey. You’ll look spiffing in them. I’m not joking, Kinch. You\nlook damn well when you’re dressed.",
        "–Thanks, Stephen said. I can’t wear them if they are grey.",
        "–He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.\nEtiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey\ntrousers.",
        "He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the\nsmooth skin.",
        "Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its\nsmokeblue mobile eyes.",
        "–That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says\nyou have g.p.i. He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. General\nparalysis of the insane!",
        "He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad\nin sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and\nthe edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strong\nwellknit trunk.",
        "–Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!",
        "Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a\ncrooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this face\nfor me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.",
        "–I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her\nall right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. Lead\nhim not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.",
        "Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes.",
        "–The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If\nWilde were only alive to see you!",
        "Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:",
        "–It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked looking-glass of a servant.",
        "Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him\nround the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had\nthrust them.",
        "–It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly. God\nknows you have more spirit than any of them.",
        "Parried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The\ncold steelpen.",
        "–Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs\nand touch him for a guinea. He’s stinking with money and thinks you’re\nnot a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or\nsome bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and I could only work\ntogether we might do something for the island. Hellenise it.",
        "Cranly’s arm. His arm.",
        "–And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I’m the only one\nthat knows what you are. Why don’t you trust me more? What have you up\nyour nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I’ll bring\ndown Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive\nKempthorpe.",
        "Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms. Palefaces:\nthey hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall\nexpire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit\nribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the\ntable, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the\ntailor’s shears. A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade. I don’t want\nto be debagged! Don’t you play the giddy ox with me!",
        "Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf\ngardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower on\nthe sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.",
        "To ourselves ... new paganism ... omphalos.",
        "–Let him stay, Stephen said. There’s nothing wrong with him except at\nnight.",
        "–Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I’m\nquite frank with you. What have you against me now?",
        "They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the\nwater like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm quietly.",
        "–Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.",
        "–Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don’t remember anything.",
        "He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow,\nfanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of\nanxiety in his eyes.",
        "Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:",
        "–Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s\ndeath?",
        "Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:",
        "–What? Where? I can’t remember anything. I remember only ideas and\nsensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?",
        "–You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get\nmore hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom.\nShe asked you who was in your room.",
        "–Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.",
        "–You said, Stephen answered, O, IT’S ONLY DEDALUS WHOSE MOTHER IS\nBEASTLY DEAD.",
        "A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck\nMulligan’s cheek.",
        "–Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?",
        "He shook his constraint from him nervously.",
        "–And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own? You saw\nonly your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and\nRichmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It’s a beastly\nthing and nothing else. It simply doesn’t matter. You wouldn’t kneel down\nto pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why? Because\nyou have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected the wrong\nway. To me it’s all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes are not\nfunctioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups\noff the quilt. Humour her till it’s over. You crossed her last wish in\ndeath and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like some hired\nmute from Lalouette’s. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I didn’t mean to\noffend the memory of your mother.",
        "He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds\nwhich the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:",
        "–I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.",
        "–Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.",
        "–Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.",
        "Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.",
        "–O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.",
        "He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post,\ngazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now grew\ndim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt\nthe fever of his cheeks.",
        "A voice within the tower called loudly:",
        "–Are you up there, Mulligan?",
        "–I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.",
        "He turned towards Stephen and said:",
        "–Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola, Kinch,\nand come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.",
        "His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level\nwith the roof:",
        "–Don’t mope over it all day, he said. I’m inconsequent. Give up the\nmoody brooding.",
        "His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the\nstairhead:",
        "    AND NO MORE TURN ASIDE AND BROOD\n   UPON LOVE’S BITTER MYSTERY\n   FOR FERGUS RULES THE BRAZEN CARS.",
        "Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the\nstairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of\nwater whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of the\ndim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the\nharpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words\nshimmering on the dim tide.",
        "A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in\ndeeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus’ song:\nI sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. Her door\nwas open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and pity I went to\nher bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For those words,\nStephen: love’s bitter mystery.",
        "Where now?",
        "Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a\ngaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the sunny\nwindow of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing in the\npantomime of TURKO THE TERRIBLE and laughed with others when he sang:",
        "    I AM THE BOY\n    THAT CAN ENJOY\n    INVISIBILITY.",
        "Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.",
        "    and No More Turn Aside and Brood.",
        "Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his\nbrooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had\napproached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,\nroasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely\nfingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s\nshirts.",
        "In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its\nloose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,\nbent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.",
        "Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On me\nalone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the tortured\nface. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on\ntheir knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. LILIATA RUTILANTIUM TE\nCONFESSORUM TURMA CIRCUMDET: IUBILANTIUM TE VIRGINUM CHORUS EXCIPIAT.",
        "Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!",
        "No, mother! Let me be and let me live.",
        "–Kinch ahoy!",
        "Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the\nstaircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry,\nheard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.",
        "–Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is\napologising for waking us last night. It’s all right.",
        "–I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.",
        "–Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our\nsakes.",
        "His head disappeared and reappeared.",
        "–I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it’s very clever. Touch\nhim for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.",
        "–I get paid this morning, Stephen said.",
        "–The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.",
        "–If you want it, Stephen said.",
        "–Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We’ll have a\nglorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent sovereigns.",
        "He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of\ntune with a Cockney accent:",
        "    O, WON’T WE HAVE A MERRY TIME,\n    DRINKING WHISKY, BEER AND WINE!\n    ON CORONATION,\n    CORONATION DAY!\n    O, WON’T WE HAVE A MERRY TIME\n    ON CORONATION DAY!",
        "Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone,\nforgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it there\nall day, forgotten friendship?",
        "He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,\nsmelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. So\nI carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and yet\nthe same. A servant too. A server of a servant.",
        "In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form\nmoved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its\nyellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor\nfrom the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of\ncoalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.",
        "–We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?",
        "Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the\nhammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open\nthe inner doors.",
        "–Have you the key? a voice asked.",
        "–Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I’m choked!",
