        "The impression produced by the first week of war was that the British\ncontingent had come just in time for the end of the world. Or rather,\nfor any sensitive and civilised man, touched by the modern doubt but by\nthe equally modern mysticism, that old theocratic vision fell far short\nof the sickening terror of the time. For it was a day of judgment in\nwhich upon the throne in heaven and above the cherubim, sat not God, but\nanother.",
        "The British had been posted at the extreme western end of the allied\nline in the north. The other end rested on the secure city and fortress\nof Namur; their end rested upon nothing. It is not wholly a sentimental\nfancy to say that there was something forlorn in the position of that\nloose end in a strange land, with only the sad fields of Northern France\nbetween them and the sea. For it was really round that loose end that\nthe foe would probably fling the lasso of his charge; it was here that\ndeath might soon be present upon every side. It must be remembered that\nmany critics, including many Englishmen, doubted whether a rust had not\neaten into this as into other parts of the national life, feared that\nEngland had too long neglected both the ethic and the technique of war,\nand would prove a weak link in the chain. The enemy was absolutely\ncertain that it was so. To these men, standing disconsolately amid the\nhedgeless plains and poplars, came the news that Namur was gone, which\nwas to their captains one of the four corners of the earth. The two\narmies had touched; and instantly the weaker took an electric shock\nwhich told of electric energy, deep into deep Germany, battery behind\nbattery of abysmal force. In the instant it was discovered that the\nenemy was more numerous than they had dreamed. He was actually more\nnumerous even than they discovered. Every oncoming horseman doubled as\nin a drunkard’s vision; and they were soon striving without speech in a\nnightmare of numbers. Then all the allied forces at the front were\noverthrown in the tragic battle of Mons; and began that black retreat,\nin which so many of our young men knew war first and at its worst in\nthis terrible world; and so many never returned.",
        "In that blackness began to grow strange emotions, long unfamiliar to our\nblood. Those six dark days are as full of legends as the six centuries\nof the Dark Ages. Many of these may be exaggerated fancies, one was\ncertainly an avowed fiction, others are quite different from it and more\ndifficult to dissipate into the daylight. But one curious fact remains\nabout them if they were all lies, or even if they were all deliberate\nworks of art. Not one of them referred to those close, crowded, and\nstirring three centuries which are nearest to us, and which alone are\ncovered in this sketch, the centuries during which the Teutonic\ninfluence had expanded itself over our islands. Ghosts were there\nperhaps, but they were the ghosts of forgotten ancestors. Nobody saw\nCromwell or even Wellington; nobody so much as thought about Cecil\nRhodes. Things were either seen or said among the British which linked\nthem up, in matters deeper than any alliance, with the French, who spoke\nof Joan of Arc in heaven above the fated city; or the Russians who\ndreamed of the Mother of God with her hand pointing to the west. They\nwere the visions or the inventions of a mediaeval army; and a prose poet\nwas in line with many popular rumours when he told of ghostly archers\ncrying “Array, Array,” as in that long-disbanded yeomanry in which I\nhave fancied Cobbett as carrying a bow. Other tales, true or only\nsymptomatic, told of one on a great white horse who was not the victor\nof Blenheim or even the Black Prince, but a faint figure out of far-off\nmartyrologies–St. George. One soldier is asserted to have claimed to\nidentify the saint because he was “on every quid.” On the coins, St.\nGeorge is a Roman soldier.",
        "But these fancies, if they were fancies, might well seem the last sickly\nflickerings of an old-world order now finally wounded to the death. That\nwhich was coming on, with the whole weight of a new world, was something\nthat had never been numbered among the Seven Champions of Christendom.\nNow, in more doubtful and more hopeful days, it is almost impossible to\nrepicture what was, for those who understood, the gigantic finality of\nthe first German strides. It seemed as if the forces of the ancient\nvalour fell away to right and left; and there opened a grand, smooth\ngranite road right to the gate of Paris, down which the great Germania\nmoved like a tall, unanswerable sphinx, whose pride could destroy all\nthings and survive them. In her train moved, like moving mountains,\nCyclopean guns that had never been seen among men, before which walled\ncities melted like wax, their mouths set insolently upwards as if\nthreatening to besiege the sun. Nor is it fantastic to speak so of the\nnew and abnormal armaments; for the soul of Germany was really expressed\nin colossal wheels and cylinders; and her guns were more symbolic than\nher flags. Then and now, and in every place and time, it is to be noted\nthat the German superiority has been in a certain thing and of a certain\nkind. It is not unity; it is not, in the moral sense, discipline.\nNothing can be more united in a moral sense than a French, British, or\nRussian regiment. Nothing, for that matter, could be more united than a\nHighland clan at Killiecrankie or a rush of religious fanatics in the\nSoudan. What such engines, in such size and multiplicity, really meant\nwas this: they meant a type of life naturally intolerable to happier and\nmore healthy-minded men, conducted on a larger scale and consuming\nlarger populations than had ever been known before. They meant cities\ngrowing larger than provinces, factories growing larger than cities;\nthey meant the empire of the slum. They meant a degree of detailed\nrepetition and dehumanised division of labour, to which no man born\nwould surrender his brief span in the sunshine, if he could hope to beat\nhis ploughshare into a sword. The nations of the earth were not to\nsurrender to the Kaiser; they were to surrender to Krupp, his master and\ntheirs; the French, the British, the Russians were to surrender to Krupp\nas the Germans themselves, after a few swiftly broken strikes, had\nalready surrendered to Krupp. Through every cogwheel in that\nincomparable machinery, through every link in that iron and unending\nchain, ran the mastery and the skill of a certain kind of artist; an\nartist whose hands are never idle through dreaming or drawn back in\ndisgust or lifted in wonder or in wrath; but sure and tireless in their\ntouch upon the thousand little things that make the invisible machinery\nof life. That artist was there in triumph; but he had no name. The\nancient world called him the Slave.",
        "From this advancing machine of millions, the slighter array of the\nAllies, and especially the British at their ultimate outpost, saved\nthemselves by a succession of hair’s-breadth escapes and what must have\nseemed to the soldiers the heartrending luck of a mouse before a cat.\nAgain and again Von Kluck’s cavalry, supported by artillery and\ninfantry, clawed round the end of the British force, which eluded it as\nby leaping back again and again. Sometimes the pursuer was, so to speak,\nso much on top of his prey that it could not even give way to him; but\nhad to hit such blows as it could in the hope of checking him for the\ninstant needed for escape. Sometimes the oncoming wave was so close that\na small individual accident, the capture of one man, would mean the\nwashing out of a whole battalion. For day after day this living death\nendured. And day after day a certain dark truth began to be revealed,\nbit by bit, certainly to the incredulous wonder of the Prussians, quite\npossibly to the surprise of the French, and quite as possibly to the\nsurprise of themselves; that there was something singular about the\nBritish soldiers. That singular thing may be expressed in a variety of\nways; but it would be almost certainly expressed insufficiently by\nanyone who had not had the moral courage to face the facts about his\ncountry in the last decades before the war. It may perhaps be best\nexpressed by saying that some thousands of Englishmen were dead: and\nthat England was not.",
        "The fortress of Maubeuge had gaped, so to speak, offering a refuge for\nthe unresting and tormented retreat; the British Generals had refused it\nand continued to fight a losing fight in the open for the sake of the\ncommon plan. At night an enormous multitude of Germans had come\nunexpectedly through the forest and caught a smaller body of the British\nin Landrecies; failed to dislodge them and lost a whole battalion in\nthat battle of the darkness. At the extreme end of the line\nSmith-Dorrien’s division, who seemed to be nearly caught or cut off, had\nfought with one gun against four, and so hammered the Germans that they\nwere forced to let go their hold; and the British were again free. When\nthe blowing up of a bridge announced that they had crossed the last\nriver, something other than that battered remnant was saved; it was the\nhonour of the thing by which we live.",
        "The driven and defeated line stood at last almost under the walls of\nParis; and the world waited for the doom of the city. The gates seemed\nto stand open; and the Prussian was to ride into it for the third and\nthe last time: for the end of its long epic of liberty and equality was\ncome. And still the very able and very French individual on whom rested\nthe last hope of the seemingly hopeless Alliance stood unruffled as a\nrock, in every angle of his sky-blue jacket and his bulldog figure. He\nhad called his bewildered soldiers back when they had broken the\ninvasion at Guise; he had silently digested the responsibility of\ndragging on the retreat, as in despair, to the last desperate leagues\nbefore the capital; and he stood and watched. And even as he watched the\nwhole huge invasion swerved.",
        "Out through Paris and out and around beyond Paris, other men in dim blue\ncoats swung out in long lines upon the plain, slowly folding upon Von\nKluck like blue wings. Von Kluck stood an instant; and then, flinging a\nfew secondary forces to delay the wing that was swinging round on him,\ndashed across the Allies’ line at a desperate angle, to smash it in the\ncentre as with a hammer. It was less desperate than it seemed; for he\ncounted, and might well count, on the moral and physical bankruptcy of\nthe British line and the end of the French line immediately in front of\nhim, which for six days and nights he had chased before him like autumn\nleaves before a whirlwind. Not unlike autumn leaves, red-stained,\ndust-hued, and tattered, they lay there as if swept into a corner. But\neven as their conquerors wheeled eastwards, their bugles blew the\ncharge; and the English went forward through the wood that is called\nCrecy, and stamped it with their seal for the second time, in the\nhighest moment of all the secular history of man.",
        "But it was not now the Crecy in which English and French knights had met\nin a more coloured age, in a battle that was rather a tournament. It was\na league of all knights for the remains of all knighthood, of all\nbrotherhood in arms or in arts, against that which is and has been\nradically unknightly and radically unbrotherly from the beginning. Much\nwas to happen after–murder and flaming folly and madness in earth and\nsea and sky; but all men knew in their hearts that the third Prussian\nthrust had failed, and Christendom was delivered once more. The empire\nof blood and iron rolled slowly back towards the darkness of the\nnorthern forests; and the great nations of the West went forward; where\nside by side as after a long lover’s quarrel, went the ensigns of St.\nDenys and St. George.",
        "The words “England” and “English” as used here require a word of\nexplanation, if only to anticipate the ire of the inevitable Scot. To\nbegin with, the word “British” involves a similar awkwardness. I have\ntried to use it in the one or two cases that referred to such things as\nmilitary glory and unity: though I am sure I have failed of full\nconsistency in so complex a matter. The difficulty is that this sense of\nglory and unity, which should certainly cover the Scotch, should also\ncover the Irish. And while it is fairly safe to call a Scotsman a North\nBriton (despite the just protest of Stevenson), it is very unsafe indeed\nto call an Irishman a West Briton. But there is a deeper difficulty. I\ncan assure the Scot that I say “England,” not because I deny Scottish\nnationality, but because I affirm it. And I can say, further, that I\ncould not here include Scots in the thesis, simply because I could not\ninclude them in the condemnation. This book is a study, not of a disease\nbut rather of a weakness, which has only been predominant in the\npredominant partner. It would not be true, for instance, to say either\nof Ireland or Scotland that the populace lacked a religion; but I do\nthink that British policy as a whole has suffered from the English lack\nof one, with its inevitable result of plutocracy and class contempt.",
