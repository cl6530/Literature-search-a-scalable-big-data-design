        "I sat down in an armchair and felt very sick.  That lasted for maybe\nfive minutes, and was succeeded by a fit of the horrors.  The poor\nstaring white face on the floor was more than I could bear, and I\nmanaged to get a table-cloth and cover it.  Then I staggered to a\ncupboard, found the brandy and swallowed several mouthfuls.  I\nhad seen men die violently before; indeed I had killed a few myself\nin the Matabele War; but this cold-blooded indoor business was\ndifferent.  Still I managed to pull myself together.  I looked at my\nwatch, and saw that it was half-past ten.",
        "An idea seized me, and I went over the flat with a small-tooth\ncomb.  There was nobody there, nor any trace of anybody, but I\nshuttered and bolted all the windows and put the chain on the door.\nBy this time my wits were coming back to me, and I could think\nagain.  It took me about an hour to figure the thing out, and I did\nnot hurry, for, unless the murderer came back, I had till about six\no’clock in the morning for my cogitations.",
        "I was in the soup–that was pretty clear.  Any shadow of a doubt\nI might have had about the truth of Scudder’s tale was now gone.\nThe proof of it was lying under the table-cloth.  The men who\nknew that he knew what he knew had found him, and had taken\nthe best way to make certain of his silence.  Yes; but he had been in\nmy rooms four days, and his enemies must have reckoned that he\nhad confided in me.  So I would be the next to go.  It might be that\nvery night, or next day, or the day after, but my number was up\nall right.",
        "Then suddenly I thought of another probability.  Supposing I\nwent out now and called in the police, or went to bed and let\nPaddock find the body and call them in the morning.  What kind of\na story was I to tell about Scudder?  I had lied to Paddock about\nhim, and the whole thing looked desperately fishy.  If I made a clean\nbreast of it and told the police everything he had told me, they\nwould simply laugh at me.  The odds were a thousand to one that I\nwould be charged with the murder, and the circumstantial evidence\nwas strong enough to hang me.  Few people knew me in England; I\nhad no real pal who could come forward and swear to my character.\nPerhaps that was what those secret enemies were playing for.  They\nwere clever enough for anything, and an English prison was as\ngood a way of getting rid of me till after June 15th as a knife in\nmy chest.",
        "Besides, if I told the whole story, and by any miracle was believed,\nI would be playing their game.  Karolides would stay at home,\nwhich was what they wanted.  Somehow or other the sight of\nScudder’s dead face had made me a passionate believer in his\nscheme.  He was gone, but he had taken me into his confidence, and\nI was pretty well bound to carry on his work.",
        "You may think this ridiculous for a man in danger of his life, but\nthat was the way I looked at it.  I am an ordinary sort of fellow, not\nbraver than other people, but I hate to see a good man downed,\nand that long knife would not be the end of Scudder if I could play\nthe game in his place.",
        "It took me an hour or two to think this out, and by that time I\nhad come to a decision.  I must vanish somehow, and keep vanished\ntill the end of the second week in June.  Then I must somehow find\na way to get in touch with the Government people and tell them\nwhat Scudder had told me.  I wished to Heaven he had told me\nmore, and that I had listened more carefully to the little he had told\nme.  I knew nothing but the barest facts.  There was a big risk that,\neven if I weathered the other dangers, I would not be believed in\nthe end.  I must take my chance of that, and hope that something\nmight happen which would confirm my tale in the eyes of the Government.",
        "My first job was to keep going for the next three weeks.  It was\nnow the 24th day of May, and that meant twenty days of hiding\nbefore I could venture to approach the powers that be.  I reckoned\nthat two sets of people would be looking for me–Scudder’s\nenemies to put me out of existence, and the police, who would\nwant me for Scudder’s murder.  It was going to be a giddy hunt,\nand it was queer how the prospect comforted me.  I had been slack\nso long that almost any chance of activity was welcome.  When I\nhad to sit alone with that corpse and wait on Fortune I was no\nbetter than a crushed worm, but if my neck’s safety was to hang on\nmy own wits I was prepared to be cheerful about it.",
        "My next thought was whether Scudder had any papers about him\nto give me a better clue to the business.  I drew back the table-cloth\nand searched his pockets, for I had no longer any shrinking from\nthe body.  The face was wonderfully calm for a man who had been\nstruck down in a moment.  There was nothing in the breast-pocket,\nand only a few loose coins and a cigar-holder in the waistcoat.  The\ntrousers held a little penknife and some silver, and the side pocket\nof his jacket contained an old crocodile-skin cigar-case.  There was\nno sign of the little black book in which I had seen him making\nnotes.  That had no doubt been taken by his murderer.",
        "But as I looked up from my task I saw that some drawers had\nbeen pulled out in the writing-table.  Scudder would never have left\nthem in that state, for he was the tidiest of mortals.  Someone must\nhave been searching for something–perhaps for the pocket-book.",
        "I went round the flat and found that everything had been ransacked\n–the inside of books, drawers, cupboards, boxes, even the\npockets of the clothes in my wardrobe, and the sideboard in the\ndining-room.  There was no trace of the book.  Most likely the enemy\nhad found it, but they had not found it on Scudder’s body.",
        "Then I got out an atlas and looked at a big map of the British\nIsles.  My notion was to get off to some wild district, where my\nveldcraft would be of some use to me, for I would be like a trapped\nrat in a city.  I considered that Scotland would be best, for my\npeople were Scotch and I could pass anywhere as an ordinary\nScotsman.  I had half an idea at first to be a German tourist, for my\nfather had had German partners, and I had been brought up to\nspeak the tongue pretty fluently, not to mention having put in\nthree years prospecting for copper in German Damaraland.  But I\ncalculated that it would be less conspicuous to be a Scot, and less in\na line with what the police might know of my past.  I fixed on\nGalloway as the best place to go.  It was the nearest wild part of\nScotland, so far as I could figure it out, and from the look of the\nmap was not over thick with population.",
        "A search in Bradshaw informed me that a train left St Pancras at\n7.10, which would land me at any Galloway station in the late\nafternoon.  That was well enough, but a more important matter was\nhow I was to make my way to St Pancras, for I was pretty certain\nthat Scudder’s friends would be watching outside.  This puzzled me\nfor a bit; then I had an inspiration, on which I went to bed and\nslept for two troubled hours.",
        "I got up at four and opened my bedroom shutters.  The faint\nlight of a fine summer morning was flooding the skies, and the\nsparrows had begun to chatter.  I had a great revulsion of feeling,\nand felt a God-forgotten fool.  My inclination was to let things\nslide, and trust to the British police taking a reasonable view of my\ncase.  But as I reviewed the situation I could find no arguments to\nbring against my decision of the previous night, so with a wry\nmouth I resolved to go on with my plan.  I was not feeling in any\nparticular funk; only disinclined to go looking for trouble, if you\nunderstand me.",
        "I hunted out a well-used tweed suit, a pair of strong nailed boots,\nand a flannel shirt with a collar.  Into my pockets I stuffed a spare\nshirt, a cloth cap, some handkerchiefs, and a tooth-brush.  I had\ndrawn a good sum in gold from the bank two days before, in case\nScudder should want money, and I took fifty pounds of it in\nsovereigns in a belt which I had brought back from Rhodesia.  That\nwas about all I wanted.  Then I had a bath, and cut my moustache,\nwhich was long and drooping, into a short stubbly fringe.",
        "Now came the next step.  Paddock used to arrive punctually at\n7.30 and let himself in with a latch-key.  But about twenty minutes\nto seven, as I knew from bitter experience, the milkman turned up\nwith a great clatter of cans, and deposited my share outside my\ndoor.  I had seen that milkman sometimes when I had gone out for\nan early ride.  He was a young man about my own height, with an\nill-nourished moustache, and he wore a white overall.  On him I\nstaked all my chances.",
        "I went into the darkened smoking-room where the rays of morning\nlight were beginning to creep through the shutters.  There I\nbreakfasted off a whisky-and-soda and some biscuits from the cupboard.\nBy this time it was getting on for six o’clock.  I put a pipe in\nMy Pocket and filled my pouch from the tobacco jar on the table by\nthe fireplace.",
        "As I poked into the tobacco my fingers touched something hard,\nand I drew out Scudder’s little black pocket-book ...",
        "That seemed to me a good omen.  I lifted the cloth from the body\nand was amazed at the peace and dignity of the dead face.  ’Goodbye,\nold chap,’ I said; ’I am going to do my best for you.  Wish me\nwell, wherever you are.’",
        "Then I hung about in the hall waiting for the milkman.  That was\nthe worst part of the business, for I was fairly choking to get out of\ndoors.  Six-thirty passed, then six-forty, but still he did not come.\nThe fool had chosen this day of all days to be late.",
        "At one minute after the quarter to seven I heard the rattle of the\ncans outside.  I opened the front door, and there was my man,\nsingling out my cans from a bunch he carried and whistling through\nhis teeth.  He jumped a bit at the sight of me.",
        "’Come in here a moment,’ I said.  ’I want a word with you.’  And\nI led him into the dining-room.",
        "’I reckon you’re a bit of a sportsman,’ I said, ’and I want you to\ndo me a service.  Lend me your cap and overall for ten minutes, and\nhere’s a sovereign for you.’",
        "His eyes opened at the sight of the gold, and he grinned broadly.\n’Wot’s the gyme?’he asked.",
        "’A bet,’ I said.  ’I haven’t time to explain, but to win it I’ve got to\nbe a milkman for the next ten minutes.  All you’ve got to do is to\nstay here till I come back.  You’ll be a bit late, but nobody will\ncomplain, and you’ll have that quid for yourself.’",
        "’Right-o!’ he said cheerily.  ’I ain’t the man to spoil a bit of sport.\n’Ere’s the rig, guv’nor.’",
        "I stuck on his flat blue hat and his white overall, picked up the\ncans, banged my door, and went whistling downstairs.  The porter\nat the foot told me to shut my jaw, which sounded as if my make-up\nwas adequate.",
        "At first I thought there was nobody in the street.  Then I caught\nsight of a policeman a hundred yards down, and a loafer shuffling\npast on the other side.  Some impulse made me raise my eyes to the\nhouse opposite, and there at a first-floor window was a face.  As the\nloafer passed he looked up, and I fancied a signal was exchanged.",
        "I crossed the street, whistling gaily and imitating the jaunty\nswing of the milkman.  Then I took the first side street, and went\nup a left-hand turning which led past a bit of vacant ground.  There\nwas no one in the little street, so I dropped the milk-cans inside the\nhoarding and sent the cap and overall after them.  I had only just\nput on my cloth cap when a postman came round the corner.  I gave\nhim good morning and he answered me unsuspiciously.  At the\nmoment the clock of a neighbouring church struck the hour of seven.",
        "There was not a second to spare.  As soon as I got to Euston\nRoad I took to my heels and ran.  The clock at Euston Station\nshowed five minutes past the hour.  At St Pancras I had no time to\ntake a ticket, let alone that I had not settled upon my destination.  A\nporter told me the platform, and as I entered it I saw the train\nalready in motion.  Two station officials blocked the way, but I\ndodged them and clambered into the last carriage.",
        "Three minutes later, as we were roaring through the northern\ntunnels, an irate guard interviewed me.  He wrote out for me a\nticket to Newton-Stewart, a name which had suddenly come back\nto my memory, and he conducted me from the first-class compartment\nwhere I had ensconced myself to a third-class smoker,\noccupied by a sailor and a stout woman with a child.  He went off\ngrumbling, and as I mopped my brow I observed to my companions\nin my broadest Scots that it was a sore job catching trains.  I had\nalready entered upon my part.",
        "’The impidence o’ that gyaird!’ said the lady bitterly.  ’He needit a\nScotch tongue to pit him in his place.  He was complainin’ o’ this\nwean no haein’ a ticket and her no fower till August twalmonth,\nand he was objectin’ to this gentleman spittin’.’",
        "The sailor morosely agreed, and I started my new life in an\natmosphere of protest against authority.  I reminded myself that a\nweek ago I had been finding the world dull.",
