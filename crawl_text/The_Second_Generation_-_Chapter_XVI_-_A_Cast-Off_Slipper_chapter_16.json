        "A large sum would soon be available; so the carrying out of the plans to\nextend, or, rather, to construct Tecumseh, must be begun. The trustees\ncommissioned young Hargrave to go abroad at once in search of educational\nand architectural ideas, and to get apparatus that would make the\nlaboratories the best in America. Chemistry and its most closely related\nsciences were to be the foundation of the new university, as they are at\nthe foundation of life. “We’ll model our school, not upon what the\nignorant wise of the Middle Ages thought ought to be life, but upon life\nitself,” said Dr. Hargrave. “We’ll build not from the clouds down, but\nfrom the ground up.” He knew in the broad outline what was wanted for the\nTecumseh of his dream; but he felt that he was too old, perhaps too\nrusted in old-fashioned ways and ideas, himself to realize the dream; so\nhe put the whole practical task upon Dory, whom he had trained from\ninfancy to just that end.",
        "When it was settled that Dory was to go, would be away a year at the\nleast, perhaps two years, he explained to Adelaide. “They expect me to\nleave within a fortnight,” he ended. And she knew what was in his\nmind–what he was hoping she would say.",
        "It so happened that, in the months since their engagement, an immense\namount of work had been thrust upon Dory. Part of it was a study of the\ngreat American universities, and that meant long absences from home. All\nof it was of the kind that must be done at once or not at all–and Work\nis the one mistress who, if she be enamored enough of a man to resolve\nto have him and no other, can compel him, whether he be enamored of her\nor not. However, for the beginning of the artificial relation between\nthis engaged couple, the chief cause was not his work but his attitude\ntoward her, his not unnatural but highly unwise regard for the peculiar\ncircumstances in which they had become engaged. Respect for the real\nfeelings of others is all very well, if not carried too far; but respect\nfor the purely imaginary feelings of others simply encourages them to\nplunge deeper into the fogs and bogs of folly. There was excuse for\nDory’s withholding from his love affair the strong and firm hand he laid\nupon all his other affairs; but it cannot be denied that he deserved what\nhe got, or, rather, that he failed to deserve what he did not get. And\nthe irony of it was that his unselfishness was chiefly to blame; for a\nselfish man would have gone straight at Del and, with Dory’s advantages,\nwould have captured her forthwith.",
        "As it was, she drifted aimlessly through day after day, keeping close at\nhome, interested in nothing. She answered briefly or not at all the\nletters from her old friends, and she noted with a certain blunted\nbitterness how their importunities fainted and died away, as the news of\nthe change in her fortunes got round. If she had been seeing them face to\nface every day, or if she had been persistent and tenacious, they would\nhave extricated themselves less abruptly; for not the least important\namong the sacred “appearances” of conventionality is the “appearance” of\ngood-heartedness; it is the graceful cloak for that icy selfishness which\nis as inevitable among the sheltered and pampered as sympathy and\nhelpfulness are among those naked to the joys and sorrows of real life.\nAdelaide was far from her friends, and she deliberately gave them every\nopportunity to abandon and to forget her without qualms or fears of\n“appearing” mean and snobbish. There were two girls from whom she rather\nhoped for signs of real friendship. She had sought them in the first\nplace because they were “of the right sort,” but she had come to like\nthem for themselves and she believed they liked her for herself. And so\nthey did; but their time was filled with the relentless routine of the\nfashionable life, and they had not a moment to spare for their own\npersonal lives; besides, Adelaide wouldn’t have “fitted in” comfortably.\nThe men of their set would be shy of her now; the women would regard her\nas a waste of time.",
        "Her beauty and her cleverness might have saved her, had she been of one\nof those “good families” whom fashionables the world over recognize,\nregardless of their wealth or poverty, because recognition of them gives\nan elegant plausibility to the pretense that Mammon is not the supreme\ngod in the Olympus of aristocracy. But–who were the Rangers? They might\nbe “all right” in Saint X, but where was Saint X? Certainly, not on any\nmap in the geography of fashion.",
        "So Adelaide, sore but too lethargic to suffer, drifted drearily along,\nfeeling that if Dory Hargrave were not under the influence of that\nbrilliant, vanished past of hers, even he would abandon her as had the\nrest, or, at least, wouldn’t care for her. Not that she doubted his\nsincerity in the ideals he professed; but people deceived themselves so\ncompletely. There was her own case; had she for an instant suspected how\nflimsily based was her own idea of herself and of her place in the\nworld?–the “world” meaning, of course, “the set.” As is the rule in\n“sets,” her self-esteem’s sole foundation had been what she had, or,\nrather, what the family had, and now that that was gone, she held what\nwas left cheap indeed–and held herself the cheaper that she could feel\nthus. At the outset, Arthur, after the familiar male fashion, was\napparently the weaker of the two. But when the test came, when the time\nfor courageous words was succeeded by the time for deeds, the shrinking\nfrom action that, since the nation grew rich, has become part of the\neducation of the women of the classes which shelter and coddle their\nwomen, caused Adelaide to seem feeble indeed beside her brother.\nAlso–and this should never be forgotten in judging such a woman–Arthur\nhad the advantage of the man’s compulsion to act, while Adelaide had the\ndisadvantage of being under no material necessity to act–and what\nnecessity but the material is there?",
        "Dory–his love misleading his passion, as it usually does when it has\nmuch influence before marriage–reasoned that, in the interest of the\nAdelaide that was to be, after they were married, and in his own interest\nwith her as well, the wise course for him to pursue was to wait until\ntime and the compulsion of new circumstances should drive away her mood,\nshould give her mind and her real character a chance to assert\nthemselves. In the commission to go abroad, he saw the external force for\nwhich he had been waiting and hoping. And it seemed to him most\ntimely–for Ross’s wedding invitations were out.",
        "“Two weeks,” said Adelaide absently. “You will sail in two weeks.” Then\nin two weeks she could be out of it all, could be far away in new\nsurroundings, among new ideas, among strangers. She could make the new\nstart; she could submerge, drown her old self in the new interests.",
        "“Will you come?” he said, when he could endure the suspense no longer.\n“Won’t you come?”",
        "She temporized. “I’m afraid I couldn’t–oughtn’t to leave–mother and\nArthur just now.”",
        "He smiled sadly. She might need her mother and her brother; but in the\nmood in which she had been for the last few months, they certainly did\nnot need her. “Adelaide,” said he, with that firmness which he knew so\nwell how to combine with gentleness, without weakening it, “our whole\nfuture depends on this. If our lives are to grow together, we must begin.\nThis is our opportunity.”",
        "She knew that Dory was not a man she could play fast and loose with, even\nhad she been so disposed. Clearly, she must decide whether she intended\nto marry him, to make his life hers and her life his. She looked\nhelplessly round. What but him was there to build on? Without him–She\nbroke the long silence with, “That is true. We must begin.” Then, after a\npause during which she tried to think and found she couldn’t, “Make up my\nmind for me.”",
        "“Let us be married day after to-morrow,” said he. “We can leave for New\nYork on the one o’clock train and sail on Thursday.”",
        "“You had it planned!”",
        "“I had several plans,” he answered. “That’s the best one.”",
        "What should she do? Impulsively–why, she did not know–she gave Dory her\nanswer: “Yes, that is the best plan. I must begin–at once.” And she\nstarted up, in a fever to be doing.",
        "Dory, dazed by his unexpected, complete victory, went immediately, lest\nhe should say or do something that would break or weaken the current of\nher aroused energy. He went without as much as touching her hand.\nCertainly, if ever man tempted fate to snatch from him the woman he\nloved, Dory did then; and at that time Del must, indeed, have been\nstrongly drawn to him, or she would have been unable to persist.",
        "The problem of the trousseau was almost as simple for her as for him. She\nhad been extravagant and luxurious, had accumulated really unmanageable\nquantities of clothing of all kinds, far, far more than any woman without\na maid could take care of. The fact that she had not had a maid was in\npart responsible for this superfluity. She had neither the time nor the\npatience for making or for directing the thousand exasperating little\nrepairs that are necessary if a woman with a small wardrobe is always to\nlook well. So, whenever repairs were necessary, she bought instead; and\nas she always kept herself fresh and perfect to the smallest detail she\nhad to buy profusely. As soon as a dress or a hat or a blouse or a\nparasol, a pair of boots, slippers, stockings, or any of the costly,\nflimsy, all but unlaunderable underwear she affected, became not quite\nperfect, she put it aside against that vague day when she should have\nleisure or inclination for superintending a seamstress. Within two hours\nof her decision she had a seamstress in the house, and they and her\nmother were at work. There was no necessity to bother about new dresses.\nShe would soon be putting off black, and she could get in Paris what she\nwould then need.",
        "In the whirlwind of those thirty-six hours, she had not a moment to think\nof anything but the material side of the wedding–the preparations for\nthe journey and for the long absence. She was half an hour late in\ngetting down to the front parlor for the ceremony, and she looked so\ntired from toil and lack of sleep that Dory in his anxiety about her was\nall but unconscious that they were going through the supposedly solemn\nmarriage rite. Looking back on it afterwards, they could remember little\nabout it–perhaps even less than can the average couple, under our social\nsystem which makes a wedding a social function, not a personal rite. They\nhad once in jesting earnest agreed that they would have the word “obey\"\nleft out of the vows; but they forgot this, and neither was conscious of\nrepeating “obey” after the preacher. Adelaide was thinking of her trunks,\nwas trying to recall the things she felt she must have neglected in the\nrush; Dory was worrying over her paleness and the heavy circles under her\neyes, was fretting about the train–Del’s tardiness had not been in the\ncalculations. Even the preacher, infected by the atmosphere of haste, ran\nover the sentences, hardly waiting for the responses. Adelaide’s mother\nwas hearing the trunks going down to the van, and was impatient to be\nwhere she could superintend–there was a very important small trunk, full\nof underclothes, which she was sure they were overlooking. Arthur was\ngloomily abstracted, was in fierce combat with the bitter and melancholy\nthoughts which arose from the contrast he could not but make–this simple\nwedding, with Dory Hargrave as her groom, when in other circumstances\nthere would have been such pomp and grandeur. He and Mary the cook and\nEllen the upstairs girl and old Miss Skeffington, generalissimo of the\nHargrave household, were the only persons present keenly conscious that\nthere was in progress a wedding, a supposedly irrevocable union of a man\nand woman for life and for death and for posterity. Even old Dr. Hargrave\nwas thinking of what Dory was to do on the other side, was mentally\ngoing over the elaborate scheme for his son’s guidance which he had drawn\nup and committed to paper. Judge Torrey, the only outsider, was putting\ninto form the speech he intended to make at the wedding breakfast.",
        "But there was no wedding breakfast–at least, none for bride and groom.\nThe instant the ceremony was over, Mary the cook whispered to Mrs.\nRanger: “Mike says they’ve just got time to miss the train.”",
        "“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Ranger. And she darted out to halt the van\nand count the trunks. Then she rushed in and was at Adelaide’s arm.\n“Hurry, child!” she exclaimed. “Here is my present for you.”",
        "And she thrust into her hand a small black leather case, the cover of a\nletter of credit. Seeing that Del was too dazed to realize what was going\non, she snatched it away and put it into the traveling case which Mary\nwas carrying. Amid much shaking hands and kissing and nervous crying,\namid flooding commonplaces and hysterical repetitions of “Good-by! Good\nluck!” the young people were got off. There was no time for Mary to bring\nthe rice from the kitchen table, but Ellen had sequestered one of\nAdelaide’s old dancing slippers under the front stair. She contrived to\nget it out and into action, and to land it full in Adelaide’s lap by a\nlucky carom against the upright of the coach window.",
        "Adelaide looked down at it vaguely. It was one of a pair of slippers she\nhad got for the biggest and most fashionable ball she had ever attended.\nShe remembered it all–the gorgeousness of the rooms, the flowers, the\ndresses, the favors, her own ecstasy in being where it was supposed to be\nso difficult to get; how her happiness had been marred in the early part\nof the evening by Ross’s attendance on Helen Galloway in whose honor the\nball was given; how he made her happy again by staying beside her the\nwhole latter part of the evening, he and more young men than any other\ngirl had. And here was the slipper, with its handsome buckle torn off,\nstained, out of shape from having been so long cast aside. Where did it\ncome from? How did it get here? Why had this ghost suddenly appeared to\nher? On the opposite seat, beside her traveling case, fashionable,\nobviously expensive, with her initials in gold, was a bag marked\n“T.H.\"–of an unfashionable appearance, obviously inexpensive, painfully\nnew. She could not take her fascinated eyes from it; and the hammering of\nher blood upon her brain, as the carriage flew toward the station, seemed\nto be a voice monotonously repeating, “Married–married–” She shuddered.\n“My fate is settled for life,” she said to herself. “I am married!”",
        "She dared not look at her husband–Husband! In that moment of cruel\nmemory, of ghastly chopfallen vanity, it was all she could do not visibly\nto shrink from him. She forgot that he was her best friend, her friend\nfrom babyhood almost, Theodore Hargrave. She felt only that he was her\nhusband, her jailer, the representative of all that divided her forever\nfrom the life of luxury and show which had so permeated her young blood\nwith its sweet, lingering poison. She descended from the carriage, passed\nthe crowd of gaping, grinning loungers, and entered the train, with\ncheeks burning and eyes downcast, an ideal bride in appearance of shy and\nrefined modesty. And none who saw her delicate, aristocratic beauty of\nface and figure and dress could have attributed to her the angry, ugly,\nsnobbish thoughts, like a black core hidden deep in the heart of a\nbewitching flower.",
        "As he sat opposite her in the compartment, she was exaggerating into\nglaring faults the many little signs of indifference to fashion in his\ndress. She had never especially noted before, but now she was noting as\na shuddering exhibition of “commonness,” that he wore detachable\ncuffs–and upon this detail her distraught mind fixed as typical. She\ncould not take her eyes off his wrists; every time he moved his arms so\nthat she could see the wristband within his cuff, she felt as if a piece\nof sandpaper were scraping her skin. He laid his hand on her two gloved\nhands, folded loosely in her lap. Every muscle, every nerve of her body\ngrew tense; she only just fought down the impulse to snatch her hands\naway and shriek at him.",
        "She sat rigid, her teeth set, her eyes closed, until her real self got\nsome control over the monstrous, crazy creature raving within her. Then\nshe said: “Please don’t–touch me–just now. I’ve been on such a\nstrain–and I’m almost breaking down.”",
        "He drew his hand away. “I ought to have understood,” he said. “Would you\nlike to be left alone for a while?”",
        "Without waiting for her answer, he left the compartment to her. She\nlocked the door and let herself loose. When she had had her cry “out,\"\nshe felt calm; but oh, so utterly depressed. “This is only a mood,” she\nsaid to herself. “I don’t really feel that way toward him. Still–I’ve\nmade a miserable mistake. I ought not to have married him. I must hide\nit. I mustn’t make him suffer for what’s altogether my own fault. I must\nmake the best of it.”",
        "When he came back, she proceeded to put her programme into action. All\nthe afternoon he strove with her sweet gentleness and exaggerated\nconsideration for him; he tried to make her see that there was no\nnecessity for this elaborate pose and pretense. But she was too absorbed\nin her part to heed him. In the evening, soon after they returned to the\ncompartment from the dining car, he rose. “I am going out to smoke,” he\nsaid. “I’ll tell the porter to make up your berth. You must be very\ntired. I have taken another–out in the car–so that you will not be\ndisturbed.”",
        "She grew white, and a timid, terrified look came into her eyes.",
        "He touched her shoulder–gently. “Don’t–please!” he said quietly. “In\nall the years we’ve known each other, have you ever seen anything in me\nto make you feel–like–that?”",
        "Her head drooped still lower, and her face became crimson.",
        "“Adelaide, look at me!”",
        "She lifted her eyes until they met his uncertainly.",
        "He put out his hand. “We are friends, aren’t we?”",
        "She instantly laid her hand in his.",
        "“Friends,” he repeated. “Let us hold fast to that–and let the rest take\ncare of itself.”",
        "“I’m ashamed of myself,” said she. And in her swift revulsion of\nfeeling there was again opportunity for him. But he was not in the mood\nto see it.",
        "“You certainly ought to be,” replied he, with his frank smile that was so\nfull of the suggestions of health and sanity and good humor. “You’ll\nnever get a martyr’s crown at my expense.”",
        "At New York he rearranged their steamer accommodations. It was no longer\ndiffidence and misplaced consideration that moved him permanently to\nestablish the most difficult of barriers between them; it was pride now,\nfor in her first stormy, moments in the train he had seen farther into\nher thoughts than he dared let himself realize.",
