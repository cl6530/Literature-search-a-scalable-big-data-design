        "The nice young man did more than find my missing trunks; he found a\ncustom-house officer, and, after asking me privately which trunks\ncontained my most valuable possessions and how much I had thought of\ndeclaring, he succeeded in having them passed through on my own\nvaluation without any undue exposure of their contents.",
        "By this time Dad had grown very respectful. To see his little\nElizabeth treated like a queen, while on all sides angry women were\nhaving their best gowns pawed over and mussed; was a most wholesome\nlesson. He paid the thousand and odd dollars duty like a little man.",
        "We’d been saved a lot of bother, and nobody hates a lot of bother\nmore than Dad. So when the trunks were locked and strapped and ready\nto be sent to our hotel, Dad went up to the nice young man and said:\n“I’m Tom Middleton, from California, and this is my daughter\nElizabeth. We’re both very grateful to you, and if you should ever\nhappen to come to California, I hope you’ll look us up.”",
        "That’s Dad all over!",
        "I never saw anybody look so pleased as the young man: “My name’s\nPorter,” he said, “Blakely Porter. If my mother were in New York I\nwould ask if she might call on Miss Middleton, but, as it happens,\nshe’s in California, where I intend to join her, so I shall look\nforward to seeing you there.”",
        "Then Dad did just the right thing. “What’s the use of waiting till\nwe get to California?” he said. “Why not dine with us to-night!”",
        "There are people, merely conventional people, who could never\nappreciate the fine directness and simplicity, of Dad’s nature—not\nif they lived to be a thousand years old. But Mr. Blakely Porter\nunderstood perfectly; I know he did, for he told me so afterwards.\n“It was the greatest compliment I ever had paid me in my life,” he\nsaid. “Your father knew nothing about me, absolutely nothing, yet he\ninvited me to dine with him—and you. It was splendid, splendid!”",
        "The dear boy didn’t know, perhaps, that honesty shone in his eyes,\nthat one could not look at him and deny he was a gentleman. And, of\ncourse, I didn’t enlighten him, for it is well for men,\nparticularly, young men, to feel grateful, and the least bit humble;\nit keeps them from being spoiled.",
        "But to return to the dinner invitation: Mr. Porter accepted it\neagerly. “It is more than kind of you,” he said. “My mother is away,\nand her house is closed. It is my first home-coming in four years,\nand I should have been lonely to-night.”",
        "And poor Dad, who has been lonely—oh, so lonely!—ever since\nNinette died, shook hands with him, and said: “If my daughter and I\ncan keep you from feeling lonely, we shall be so. glad. We are\nstopping at The Plaza, and we dine at half past seven.”",
        "Then Mr. Porter found us a taxi-cab, and away we went.",
        "It was good to be in America again. I made Dad stop the car, and\nhave the top put back, even though it was freezing cold, for I had\nnever been in New York before (when I’d gone to France, I had sailed\nfrom New Orleans) and I wanted to see everything. The tall\nbuildings, the elevated, even the bad paving till we got to Fifth\nAvenue, interested me immensely, as they would any one to whom.\nParis had been home, and New York a foreign city. Not that I had\never thought of Paris as my real home; home was, where my heart was-\n-with Dad. I tried to make him understand how, happy I was to be\nwith him, how I had missed him, and California.",
        "“So you missed your old father; did you, girlie?”",
        "“Yes, Dad.”",
        "“And you’ll be glad to go to California?”",
        "“Oh, so glad!”",
        "“Then,” said Dad, “we’ll start tomorrow.”",
        "Our rooms at the hotel were perfect; there was a bed room and bath\nfor me a bed room and bath for Dad, with a sitting room between, all\nfacing the Park. And there were roses everywhere; huge American\nBeauties, dear, wee, pink roses, roses of flaming red. I turned to\nDad, who was standing in the middle of the sitting room, beaming at\nme. “You delightful old spendthrift!” I cried. “What do you mean by\nbuying millions of roses? And in the middle of January too! You\ndeserve to be disciplined, and you shall be.”",
        "“Discipline is an excellent thing; even if it does disturb the set\nof one’s tie,” Dad remarked thoughtfully, a moment later.",
        "“I couldn’t help hugging you, Daddy.”",
        "“My dear, that hug of yours was the sweetest thing that has happened\nto your dad in many a long year.”",
        "And then, of course, I had to hug him again.",
        "After luncheon (we had it in our sitting room) Dad asked if I would\nenjoy a drive through the Park.",
        "“I should enjoy it immensely,” I said, “but I can’t possibly go.”",
        "You see, there was a trunk to unpack, the one holding my prettiest\ndinner gown. Of course Valentine was quite capable of attending to\nthe unpacking. Still, one likes to inspect everything one is to\nwear, especially when one is expecting a guest to dinner. “Then,\"\nsaid Dad, “I think I’ll order dinner, and go for a walk., shall we\nhave dinner here?”",
        "“Oh, by all means! This is so much more homelike than a public\ndining room.”",
        "“I’ll not be gone more than an hour or two. . . Hullo! Come in.”",
        "A small boy entered, carrying a box quite as big as himself. “For\nMiss Middleton,” he said.",
        "“Another present from you, Dad?”",
        "“Open it, my dear.”",
        "“I thought so,” he remarked, as the removal of the cover displayed\nmore American Beauties. (There were five dozen;) I counted them\nafter Dad had gone. Another million roses and in the middle of\nJanuary! “Who’s the spendthrift this time, Elizabeth?”",
        "“His name,” I said, slipping a card: from the envelope that lay on a\nhuge bow of red ribbon, “is Mr. Blakely Porter.”",
        "Although I know, now, there are many things more beautiful, I\nbelieved, then, that nothing more beautiful had ever happened; for\nit was the first time a man had ever sent me roses. Nineteen years\nold, and my first roses! They made me so happy. Paris seemed very\nfar away; the convent was a mythical place I had seen in a dream;\nnothing was real but Dad, and America, and the roses somebody, had\nsent. Somebody!",
