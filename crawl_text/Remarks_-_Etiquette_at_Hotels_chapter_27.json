        "Etiquette at hotels is a subject that has been but lightly treated upon by\nour modern philosophy, and yet it is a subject that lies very near to\nevery American heart. Had I not already more reforms on hand than I can\npossibly successfully operate I would gladly use my strong social\ninfluence and trenchant pen in that direction. Etiquette at hotels, both\non the part of the proprietor, and his hirelings, and the guest, is a\nmatter that calls loudly for improvement.",
        "The hotel waiter alone, would well repay a close study. From the tardy and\npolished loiterer of the effete East, to the off-hand and social equal of\nthe budding West, all waiters are deserving of philosophical scrutiny. I\nwas thrown in contact with a waiter in New York last summer, whose manners\nwere far more polished than my own. Every time I saw him standing there\nwith his immediate pantaloons and swallow-tail coat, and the far-away,\nchastened look of one who had been unfortunate, but not crushed, I felt\nthat I was unworthy to be waited upon by such a blue-blooded thoroughbred,\nand I often wished that we had more such men in Congress. And when he\nwould take my order and go away with it, and after the meridian of my life\nhad softened into the mellow glory of the sere and yellow leaf, when he\ncame back, still looking quite young, and never having forgotten me,\nrecognizing me readily after the long, dull, desolate years, I was glad,\nand I felt that he deserved something more than mere empty thanks and I\nsaid to him: “Ah, sir, you still remember me after years of privation and\nsuffering. When every one else in New York has forgotten me, with the\nexception of the confidence man, you came to me with the glad light of\nrecognition in your clear eye. Would you be offended if I gave you this\ntrifling testimonial of my regard?” at the same time giving him my note at\nthirty days.",
        "I wanted him to have something by which to always remember me, and I guess\nhe has.",
        "Speaking of waiters, reminds me of one at Glendive, Montana. We had to\ntelegraph ahead in order to get a place to sleep, and when we registered\nthe landlord shoved out an old double-entry journal for us to record our\nnames and postoffice address in. The office was the bar and before we\ncould get our rooms assigned us, we had to wait forty-five minutes for the\nlandlord to collect pay for thirteen drinks and lick a personal friend.\nFinally, when he got around to me, he told me that I could sleep in the\nnight bar-tender’s bed, as he would be up all night, and might possibly\nget killed and never need it again, anyhow. It would cost me $4 cash in\nadvance to sleep one night in the bartender’s bed, he said, and the house\nwas so blamed full that he and his wife had got to wait till things kind\nof quieted down, and then they would have to put a mattress on the 15 ball\npool table and sleep there.",
        "I called attention to my valuable valise that had been purchased at great\ncost, and told him that he would be safe to keep that behind the bar till\nI paid; but he said he wasn’t in the second-hand valise business, and so I\npaid in advance. It was humiliating, but he had the edge on me.",
        "At the tea table I noticed that the waiter was a young man who evidently\nhad not been always thus. He had the air of one who yearns to have some\none tread on the tail of his coat. Meekness, with me, is one of my\ncharacteristics. It is almost a passion. It is the result of personal\ninjuries received in former years at the hands of parties who excelled me\nin brute force and who succeeded in drawing me out in conversation, as it\nwere, till I made remarks that were injudicious.",
        "So I did not disagree with this waiter, although I had grounds. When he\ncame around and snorted in my ear, “Salt pork, antelope and cold beans,\"\nat the same time leaning his full weight on my back, while he evaded the\nrevenue laws by retailing his breath to the guests without a license, I\nthought I would call for what he had the most of, so I said if he didn’t\nmind and it wouldn’t be too much trouble, I would take cold beans.",
        "I will leave it to the calm, impassionate and unpartisan reader to state\nwhether that remark ought to create ill-feeling. I do not think it ought.\nHowever, he was irritable, and life to him seemed to be cold and dark. So\nhe went to the general delivery window that led into the cold bean\nlaboratory, and remarked in a hoarse, insolent, and ironical tone of\nvoice:",
        "“Nother damned suspicious looking character wants cold beans.”",
