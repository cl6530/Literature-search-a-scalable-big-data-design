        "Mme. de Beauseant turned to Rastignac. “What was the blunder that you\nmade, monsieur?” she asked. “The poor boy is only just launched into\nthe world, Antoinette, so that he understands nothing of all this that\nwe are speaking of. Be merciful to him, and let us finish our talk\nto-morrow. Everything will be announced to-morrow, you know, and your\nkind informal communication can be accompanied by official\nconfirmation.”",
        "The Duchess gave Eugene one of those insolent glances that measure a\nman from head to foot, and leave him crushed and annihilated.",
        "“Madame, I have unwittingly plunged a dagger into Mme. de Restaud’s\nheart; unwittingly–therein lies my offence,” said the student of law,\nwhose keen brain had served him sufficiently well, for he had detected\nthe biting epigrams that lurked beneath this friendly talk. “You\ncontinue to receive, possibly you fear, those who know the amount of\npain that they deliberately inflict; but a clumsy blunderer who has no\nidea how deeply he wounds is looked upon as a fool who does not know\nhow to make use of his opportunities, and every one despises him.”",
        "Mme. de Beauseant gave the student a glance, one of those glances in\nwhich a great soul can mingle dignity and gratitude. It was like balm\nto the law student, who was still smarting under the Duchess’ insolent\nscrutiny; she had looked at him as an auctioneer might look at some\narticle to appraise its value.",
        "“Imagine, too, that I had just made some progress with the Comte de\nRestaud; for I should tell you, madame,” he went on, turning to the\nDuchess with a mixture of humility and malice in his manner, “that as\nyet I am only a poor devil of a student, very much alone in the world,\nand very poor––”",
        "“You should not tell us that, M. de Rastignac. We women never care\nabout anything that no one else will take.”",
        "“Bah!” said Eugene. “I am only two-and-twenty, and I must make up my\nmind to the drawbacks of my time of life. Besides, I am confessing my\nsins, and it would be impossible to kneel in a more charming\nconfessional; you commit your sins in one drawing-room, and receive\nabsolution for them in another.”",
        "The Duchess’ expression grew colder, she did not like the flippant\ntone of these remarks, and showed that she considered them to be in\nbad taste by turning to the Vicomtesse with–\"This gentleman has only\njust come––”",
        "Mme. de Beauseant began to laugh outright at her cousin and at the\nDuchess both.",
        "“He has only just come to Paris, dear, and is in search of some one\nwho will give him lessons in good taste.”",
        "“Mme. la Duchesse,” said Eugene, “is it not natural to wish to be\ninitiated into the mysteries which charm us?” (\"Come, now,” he said to\nhimself, “my language is superfinely elegant, I’m sure.”)",
        "“But Mme. de Restaud is herself, I believe, M. de Trailles’ pupil,\"\nsaid the Duchess.",
        "“Of that I had no idea, madame,” answered the law student, “so I\nrashly came between them. In fact, I got on very well with the lady’s\nhusband, and his wife tolerated me for a time until I took it into my\nhead to tell them that I knew some one of whom I had just caught a\nglimpse as he went out by a back staircase, a man who had given the\nCountess a kiss at the end of a passage.”",
        "“Who was it?” both women asked together.",
        "“An old man who lives at the rate of two louis a month in the Faubourg\nSaint-Marceau, where I, a poor student, lodge likewise. He is a truly\nunfortunate creature, everybody laughs at him–we all call him ’Father\nGoriot.’”",
        "“Why, child that you are,” cried the Vicomtesse, “Mme. de Restaud was\na Mlle. Goriot!”",
        "“The daughter of a vermicelli manufacturer,” the Duchess added; “and\nwhen the little creature went to Court, the daughter of a pastry-cook\nwas presented on the same day. Do you remember, Claire? The King began\nto laugh, and made some joke in Latin about flour. People–what was\nit?–people––”",
        "“Ejusdem farinoe,” said Eugene.",
        "“Yes, that was it,” said the Duchess.",
        "“Oh! is that her father?” the law student continued, aghast.",
        "“Yes, certainly; the old man had two daughters; he dotes on them, so\nto speak, though they will scarcely acknowledge him.”",
        "“Didn’t the second daughter marry a banker with a German name?” the\nVicomtesse asked, turning to Mme. de Langeais, “a Baron de Nucingen?\nAnd her name is Delphine, is it not? Isn’t she a fair-haired woman who\nhas a side-box at the Opera? She comes sometimes to the Bouffons, and\nlaughs loudly to attract attention.”",
        "The Duchess smiled and said:",
        "“I wonder at you, dear. Why do you take so much interest in people of\nthat kind? One must have been as madly in love as Restaud was, to be\ninfatuated with Mlle. Anastasie and her flour sacks. Oh! he will not\nfind her a good bargain! She is in M. de Trailles’ hands, and he will\nruin her.”",
        "“And they do not acknowledge their father!” Eugene repeated.",
        "“Oh! well, yes, their father, the father, a father,” replied the\nVicomtesse, “a kind father who gave them each five or six hundred\nthousand francs, it is said, to secure their happiness by marrying\nthem well; while he only kept eight or ten thousand livres a year for\nhimself, thinking that his daughters would always be his daughters,\nthinking that in them he would live his life twice over again, that in\ntheir houses he should find two homes, where he would be loved and\nlooked up to, and made much of. And in two years’ time both his\nsons-in-law had turned him out of their houses as if he were one\nof the lowest outcasts.”",
        "Tears came into Eugene’s eyes. He was still under the spell of\nyouthful beliefs, he had just left home, pure and sacred feelings had\nbeen stirred within him, and this was his first day on the battlefield\nof civilization in Paris. Genuine feeling is so infectious that for a\nmoment the three looked at each other in silence.",
        "“Eh, mon Dieu!” said Mme. de Langeais; “yes, it seems very horrible,\nand yet we see such things every day. Is there not a reason for it?\nTell me, dear, have you ever really thought what a son-in-law is? A\nson-in-law is the man for whom we bring up, you and I, a dear little\none, bound to us very closely in innumerable ways; for seventeen years\nshe will be the joy of her family, its ’white soul,’ as Lamartine\nsays, and suddenly she will become its scourge. When HE comes and\ntakes her from us, his love from the very beginning is like an axe\nlaid to the root of all the old affection in our darling’s heart, and\nall the ties that bound her to her family are severed. But yesterday\nour little daughter thought of no one but her mother and father, as we\nhad no thought that was not for her; by to-morrow she will have become\na hostile stranger. The tragedy is always going on under our eyes. On\nthe one hand you see a father who has sacrificed himself to his son,\nand his daughter-in-law shows him the last degree of insolence. On the\nother hand, it is the son-in-law who turns his wife’s mother out of\nthe house. I sometimes hear it said that there is nothing dramatic\nabout society in these days; but the Drama of the Son-in-law is\nappalling, to say nothing of our marriages, which have come to be very\npoor farces. I can explain how it all came about in the old vermicelli\nmaker’s case. I think I recollect that Foriot––”",
        "“Goriot, madame.”",
        "“Yes, that Moriot was once President of his Section during the\nRevolution. He was in the secret of the famous scarcity of grain, and\nlaid the foundation of his fortune in those days by selling flour for\nten times its cost. He had as much flour as he wanted. My\ngrandmother’s steward sold him immense quantities. No doubt Noriot\nshared the plunder with the Committee of Public Salvation, as that\nsort of person always did. I recollect the steward telling my\ngrandmother that she might live at Grandvilliers in complete security,\nbecause her corn was as good as a certificate of civism. Well, then,\nthis Loriot, who sold corn to those butchers, has never had but one\npassion, they say–he idolizes his daughters. He settled one of them\nunder Restaud’s roof, and grafted the other into the Nucingen family\ntree, the Baron de Nucingen being a rich banker who had turned\nRoyalist. You can quite understand that so long as Bonaparte was\nEmperor, the two sons-in-law could manage to put up with the old\nNinety-three; but after the restoration of the Bourbons, M. de Restaud\nfelt bored by the old man’s society, and the banker was still more\ntired of it. His daughters were still fond of him; they wanted ’to\nkeep the goat and the cabbage,’ so they used to see Joriot whenever\nthere was no one there, under pretence of affection. ’Come to-day,\npapa, we shall have you all to ourselves, and that will be much\nnicer!’ and all that sort of thing. As for me, dear, I believe that\nlove has second-sight: poor Ninety-three; his heart must have bled. He\nsaw that his daughters were ashamed of him, that if they loved their\nhusbands his visits must make mischief. So he immolated himself. He\nmade the sacrifice because he was a father; he went into voluntary\nexile. His daughters were satisfied, so he thought that he had done\nthe best thing he could; but it was a family crime, and father and\ndaughters were accomplices. You see this sort of thing everywhere.\nWhat could this old Doriot have been but a splash of mud in his\ndaughters’ drawing-rooms? He would only have been in the way, and\nbored other people, besides being bored himself. And this that\nhappened between father and daughters may happen to the prettiest\nwoman in Paris and the man she loves the best; if her love grows\ntiresome, he will go; he will descend to the basest trickery to leave\nher. It is the same with all love and friendship. Our heart is a\ntreasury; if you pour out all its wealth at once, you are bankrupt. We\nshow no more mercy to the affection that reveals its utmost extent\nthan we do to another kind of prodigal who has not a penny left. Their\nfather had given them all he had. For twenty years he had given his\nwhole heart to them; then, one day, he gave them all his fortune too.\nThe lemon was squeezed; the girls left the rest in the gutter.”",
        "“The world is very base,” said the Vicomtesse, plucking at the threads\nof her shawl. She did not raise her head as she spoke; the words that\nMme. de Langeais had meant for her in the course of her story had cut\nher to the quick.",
        "“Base? Oh, no,” answered the Duchess; “the world goes its own way,\nthat is all. If I speak in this way, it is only to show that I am not\nduped by it. I think as you do,” she said, pressing the Vicomtesse’s\nhand. “The world is a slough; let us try to live on the heights above\nit.”",
        "She rose to her feet and kissed Mme. de Beauseant on the forehead as\nshe said: “You look very charming to-day, dear. I have never seen such\na lovely color in your cheeks before.”",
        "Then she went out with a slight inclination of the head to the cousin.",
        "“Father Goriot is sublime!” said Eugene to himself, as he remembered\nhow he had watched his neighbor work the silver vessel into a\nshapeless mass that night.",
        "Mme. de Beauseant did not hear him; she was absorbed in her own\nthoughts. For several minutes the silence remained unbroken till the\nlaw student became almost paralyzed with embarrassment, and was\nequally afraid to go or stay or speak a word.",
        "“The world is basely ungrateful and ill-natured,” said the Vicomtesse\nat last. “No sooner does a trouble befall you than a friend is ready\nto bring the tidings and to probe your heart with the point of a\ndagger while calling on you to admire the handle. Epigrams and\nsarcasms already! Ah! I will defend myself!”",
        "She raised her head like the great lady that she was, and lightnings\nflashed from her proud eyes.",
        "“Ah!” she said, as she saw Eugene, “are you there?”",
        "“Still,” he said piteously.",
        "“Well, then, M. de Rastignac, deal with the world as it deserves. You\nare determined to succeed? I will help you. You shall sound the depths\nof corruption in woman; you shall measure the extent of man’s pitiful\nvanity. Deeply as I am versed in such learning, there were pages in\nthe book of life that I had not read. Now I know all. The more\ncold-blooded your calculations, the further you will go. Strike\nruthlessly; you will be feared. Men and women for you must be nothing\nmore than post-horses; take a fresh relay, and leave the last to drop\nby the roadside; in this way you will reach the goal of your ambition.\nYou will be nothing here, you see, unless a woman interests herself in\nyou; and she must be young and wealthy, and a woman of the world. Yet,\nif you have a heart, lock it carefully away like a treasure; do not\nlet any one suspect it, or you will be lost; you would cease to be the\nexecutioner, you would take the victim’s place. And if ever you should\nlove, never let your secret escape you! Trust no one until you are\nvery sure of the heart to which you open your heart. Learn to mistrust\nevery one; take every precaution for the sake of the love which does\nnot exist as yet. Listen, Miguel\"–the name slipped from her so\nnaturally that she did not notice her mistake–\"there is something\nstill more appalling than the ingratitude of daughters who have cast\noff their old father and wish that he were dead, and that is a rivalry\nbetween two sisters. Restaud comes of a good family, his wife has been\nreceived into their circle; she has been presented at court; and her\nsister, her wealthy sister, Mme. Delphine de Nucingen, the wife of a\ngreat capitalist, is consumed with envy, and ready to die of spleen.\nThere is gulf set between the sisters–indeed, they are sisters no\nlonger–the two women who refuse to acknowledge their father do not\nacknowledge each other. So Mme. de Nucingen would lap up all the mud\nthat lies between the Rue Saint-Lazare and the Rue de Grenelle to gain\nadmittance to my salon. She fancied that she should gain her end\nthrough de Marsay; she has made herself de Marsay’s slave, and she\nbores him. De Marsay cares very little about her. If you will\nintroduce her to me, you will be her darling, her Benjamin; she will\nidolize you. If, after that, you can love her, do so; if not, make her\nuseful. I will ask her to come once or twice to one of my great\ncrushes, but I will never receive her here in the morning. I will bow\nto her when I see her, and that will be quite sufficient. You have\nshut the Comtesse de Restaud’s door against you by mentioning Father\nGoriot’s name. Yes, my good friend, you may call at her house twenty\ntimes, and every time out of the twenty you will find that she is not\nat home. The servants have their orders, and will not admit you. Very\nwell, then, now let Father Goriot gain the right of entry into her\nsister’s house for you. The beautiful Mme. de Nucingen will give the\nsignal for a battle. As soon as she singles you out, other women will\nbegin to lose their heads about you, and her enemies and rivals and\nintimate friends will all try to take you from her. There are women\nwho will fall in love with a man because another woman has chosen him;\nlike the city madams, poor things, who copy our millinery, and hope\nthereby to acquire our manners. You will have a success, and in Paris\nsuccess is everything; it is the key of power. If the women credit you\nwith wit and talent, the men will follow suit so long as you do not\nundeceive them yourself. There will be nothing you may not aspire to;\nyou will go everywhere, and you will find out what the world is–an\nassemblage of fools and knaves. But you must be neither the one nor\nthe other. I am giving you my name like Ariadne’s clue of thread to\ntake with you into the labyrinth; make no unworthy use of it,” she\nsaid, with a queenly glance and curve of her throat; “give it back to\nme unsullied. And now, go; leave me. We women also have our battles to\nfight.”",
        "“And if you should ever need some one who would gladly set a match to\na train for you––”",
        "“Well?” she asked.",
        "He tapped his heart, smiled in answer to his cousin’s smile, and went.",
        "It was five o’clock, and Eugene was hungry; he was afraid lest he\nshould not be in time for dinner, a misgiving which made him feel that\nit was pleasant to be borne so quickly across Paris. This sensation of\nphysical comfort left his mind free to grapple with the thoughts that\nassailed him. A mortification usually sends a young man of his age\ninto a furious rage; he shakes his fist at society, and vows vengeance\nwhen his belief in himself is shaken. Just then Rastignac was\noverwhelmed by the words, “You have shut the Countess’ door against\nyou.”",
        "“I shall call!” he said to himself, “and if Mme. de Beauseant is\nright, if I never find her at home–I . . . well, Mme. de Restaud\nshall meet me in every salon in Paris. I will learn to fence and have\nsome pistol practice, and kill that Maxime of hers!”",
        "“And money?” cried an inward monitor. “How about money, where is that\nto come from?” And all at once the wealth displayed in the Countess de\nRestaud’s drawing-room rose before his eyes. That was the luxury which\nGoriot’s daughter had loved too well, the gilding, the ostentatious\nsplendor, the unintelligent luxury of the parvenu, the riotous\nextravagance of a courtesan. Then the attractive vision suddenly went\nunder an eclipse as he remembered the stately grandeur of the Hotel de\nBeauseant. As his fancy wandered among these lofty regions in the\ngreat world of Paris, innumerable dark thoughts gathered in his heart;\nhis ideas widened, and his conscience grew more elastic. He saw the\nworld as it is; saw how the rich lived beyond the jurisdiction of law\nand public opinion, and found in success the ultima ratio mundi.",
        "“Vautrin is right, success is virtue!” he said to himself.",
        "Arrived in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, he rushed up to his room\nfor ten francs wherewith to satisfy the demands of the cabman, and\nwent in to dinner. He glanced round the squalid room, saw the eighteen\npoverty-stricken creatures about to feed like cattle in their stalls,\nand the sight filled him with loathing. The transition was too sudden,\nand the contrast was so violent that it could not but act as a\npowerful stimulant; his ambition developed and grew beyond all social\nbounds. On the one hand, he beheld a vision of social life in its most\ncharming and refined forms, of quick-pulsed youth, of fair,\nimpassioned faces invested with all the charm of poetry, framed in a\nmarvelous setting of luxury or art; and, on the other hand, he saw a\nsombre picture, the miry verge beyond these faces, in which passion\nwas extinct and nothing was left of the drama but the cords and\npulleys and bare mechanism. Mme. de Beauseant’s counsels, the words\nuttered in anger by the forsaken lady, her petulant offer, came to his\nmind, and poverty was a ready expositor. Rastignac determined to open\ntwo parallel trenches so as to insure success; he would be a learned\ndoctor of law and a man of fashion. Clearly he was still a child!\nThose two lines are asymptotes, and will never meet.",
        "“You are very dull, my lord Marquis,” said Vautrin, with one of the\nshrewd glances that seem to read the innermost secrets of another\nmind.",
        "“I am not in the humor to stand jokes from people who call me ’my lord\nMarquis,’” answered Eugene. “A marquis here in Paris, if he is not\nthe veriest sham, ought to have a hundred thousand livres a year at\nleast; and a lodger in the Maison Vauquer is not exactly Fortune’s\nfavorite.”",
        "Vautrin’s glance at Rastignac was half-paternal, half-contemptuous.\n“Puppy!” it seemed to say; “I should make one mouthful of him!” Then\nhe answered:",
        "“You are in a bad humor; perhaps your visit to the beautiful Comtesse\nde Restaud was not a success.”",
        "“She has shut her door against me because I told her that her father\ndined at our table,” cried Rastignac.",
        "Glances were exchanged all round the room; Father Goriot looked down.",
        "“You have sent some snuff into my eye,” he said to his neighbor,\nturning a little aside to rub his hand over his face.",
        "“Any one who molests Father Goriot will have henceforward to reckon\nwith me,” said Eugene, looking at the old man’s neighbor; “he is worth\nall the rest of us put together.–I am not speaking of the ladies,” he\nadded, turning in the direction of Mlle. Taillefer.",
        "Eugene’s remarks produced a sensation, and his tone silenced the\ndinner-table. Vautrin alone spoke. “If you are going to champion\nFather Goriot, and set up for his responsible editor into the bargain,\nyou had need be a crack shot and know how to handle the foils,” he\nsaid, banteringly.",
        "“So I intend,” said Eugene.",
        "“Then you are taking the field to-day?”",
        "“Perhaps,” Rastignac answered. “But I owe no account of myself to any\none, especially as I do not try to find out what other people do of a\nnight.”",
        "Vautrin looked askance at Rastignac.",
        "“If you do not mean to be deceived by the puppets, my boy, you must go\nbehind and see the whole show, and not peep through holes in the\ncurtain. That is enough,” he added, seeing that Eugene was about to\nfly into a passion. “We can have a little talk whenever you like.”",
        "There was a general feeling of gloom and constraint. Father Goriot was\nso deeply dejected by the student’s remark that he did not notice the\nchange in the disposition of his fellow-lodgers, nor know that he had\nmet with a champion capable of putting an end to the persecution.",
        "“Then, M. Goriot sitting there is the father of a countess,” said Mme.\nVauquer in a low voice.",
        "“And of a baroness,” answered Rastignac.",
        "“That is about all he is capable of,” said Bianchon to Rastignac; “I\nhave taken a look at his head; there is only one bump–the bump of\nPaternity; he must be an eternal father.”",
        "Eugene was too intent on his thoughts to laugh at Bianchon’s joke. He\ndetermined to profit by Mme. de Beauseant’s counsels, and was asking\nhimself how he could obtain the necessary money. He grew grave. The\nwide savannas of the world stretched before his eyes; all things lay\nbefore him, nothing was his. Dinner came to an end, the others went,\nand he was left in the dining-room.",
        "“So you have seen my daughter?” Goriot spoke tremulously, and the\nsound of his voice broke in upon Eugene’s dreams. The young man took\nthe elder’s hand, and looked at him with something like kindness in\nhis eyes.",
        "“You are a good and noble man,” he said. “We will have some talk about\nyour daughters by and by.”",
        "He rose without waiting for Goriot’s answer, and went to his room.\nThere he wrote the following letter to his mother:–",
        " “My Dear Mother,–Can you nourish your child from your breast\n  again? I am in a position to make a rapid fortune, but I want\n  twelve hundred francs–I must have them at all costs. Say nothing\n  about this to my father; perhaps he might make objections, and\n  unless I have the money, I may be led to put an end to myself, and\n  so escape the clutches of despair. I will tell you everything when\n  I see you. I will not begin to try to describe my present\n  situation; it would take volumes to put the whole story clearly\n  and fully. I have not been gambling, my kind mother, I owe no one\n  a penny; but if you would preserve the life that you gave me, you\n  must send me the sum I mention. As a matter of fact, I go to see\n  the Vicomtesse de Beauseant; she is using her influence for me; I\n  am obliged to go into society, and I have not a penny to lay out\n  on clean gloves. I can manage to exist on bread and water, or go\n  without food, if need be, but I cannot do without the tools with\n  which they cultivate the vineyards in this country. I must\n  resolutely make up my mind at once to make my way, or stick in the\n  mire for the rest of my days. I know that all your hopes are set\n  on me, and I want to realize them quickly. Sell some of your old\n  jewelry, my kind mother; I will give you other jewels very soon. I\n  know enough of our affairs at home to know all that such a\n  sacrifice means, and you must not think that I would lightly ask\n  you to make it; I should be a monster if I could. You must think\n  of my entreaty as a cry forced from me by imperative necessity.\n  Our whole future lies in the subsidy with which I must begin my\n  first campaign, for life in Paris is one continual battle. If you\n  cannot otherwise procure the whole of the money, and are forced to\n  sell our aunt’s lace, tell her that I will send her some still\n  handsomer,” and so forth.",
        "He wrote to ask each of his sisters for their savings–would they\ndespoil themselves for him, and keep the sacrifice a secret from the\nfamily? To his request he knew that they would not fail to respond\ngladly, and he added to it an appeal to their delicacy by touching the\nchord of honor that vibrates so loudly in young and high-strung\nnatures.",
        "Yet when he had written the letters, he could not help feeling\nmisgivings in spite of his youthful ambition; his heart beat fast, and\nhe trembled. He knew the spotless nobleness of the lives buried away\nin the lonely manor house; he knew what trouble and what joy his\nrequest would cause his sisters, and how happy they would be as they\ntalked at the bottom of the orchard of that dear brother of theirs in\nParis. Visions rose before his eyes; a sudden strong light revealed\nhis sisters secretly counting over their little store, devising some\ngirlish stratagem by which the money could be sent to him incognito,\nessaying, for the first time in their lives, a piece of deceit that\nreached the sublime in its unselfishness.",
        "“A sister’s heart is a diamond for purity, a deep sea of tenderness!\"\nhe said to himself. He felt ashamed of those letters.",
        "What power there must be in the petitions put up by such hearts; how\npure the fervor that bears their souls to Heaven in prayer! What\nexquisite joy they would find in self-sacrifice! What a pang for his\nmother’s heart if she could not send him all that he asked for! And\nthis noble affection, these sacrifices made at such terrible cost,\nwere to serve as the ladder by which he meant to climb to Delphine de\nNucingen. A few tears, like the last grains of incense flung upon the\nsacred alter fire of the hearth, fell from his eyes. He walked up and\ndown, and despair mingled with his emotion. Father Goriot saw him\nthrough the half-open door.",
        "“What is the matter, sir?” he asked from the threshold.",
        "“Ah! my good neighbor, I am as much a son and brother as you are a\nfather. You do well to fear for the Comtesse Anastasie; there is one\nM. Maxime de Trailles, who will be her ruin.”",
        "Father Goriot withdrew, stammering some words, but Eugene failed to\ncatch their meaning.",
        "The next morning Rastignac went out to post his letters. Up to the\nlast moment he wavered and doubted, but he ended by flinging them into\nthe box. “I shall succeed!” he said to himself. So says the gambler;\nso says the great captain; but the three words that have been the\nsalvation of some few, have been the ruin of many more.",
        "A few days after this Eugene called at Mme. de Restaud’s house; she\nwas not at home. Three times he tried the experiment, and three times\nhe found her doors closed against him, though he was careful to choose\nan hour when M. de Trailles was not there. The Vicomtesse was right.",
        "The student studied no longer. He put in an appearance at lectures\nsimply to answer to his name, and after thus attesting his presence,\ndeparted forthwith. He had been through a reasoning process familiar\nto most students. He had seen the advisability of deferring his\nstudies to the last moment before going up for his examinations; he\nmade up his mind to cram his second and third years’ work into the\nthird year, when he meant to begin to work in earnest, and to complete\nhis studies in law with one great effort. In the meantime he had\nfifteen months in which to navigate the ocean of Paris, to spread the\nnets and set the lines that would bring him a protectress and a\nfortune. Twice during that week he saw Mme. de Beauseant; he did not\ngo to her house until he had seen the Marquis d’Ajuda drive away.",
        "Victory for yet a few more days was with the great lady, the most\npoetic figure in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; and the marriage of the\nMarquis d’Ajuda-Pinto with Mlle. de Rochefide was postponed. The dread\nof losing her happiness filled those days with a fever of joy unknown\nbefore, but the end was only so much the nearer. The Marquis d’Ajuda\nand the Rochefides agreed that this quarrel and reconciliation was a\nvery fortunate thing; Mme. de Beauseant (so they hoped) would\ngradually become reconciled to the idea of the marriage, and in the\nend would be brought to sacrifice d’Ajuda’s morning visits to the\nexigencies of a man’s career, exigencies which she must have foreseen.\nIn spite of the most solemn promises, daily renewed, M. d’Ajuda was\nplaying a part, and the Vicomtesse was eager to be deceived. “Instead\nof taking a leap heroically from the window, she is falling headlong\ndown the staircase,” said her most intimate friend, the Duchesse de\nLangeais. Yet this after-glow of happiness lasted long enough for the\nVicomtesse to be of service to her young cousin. She had a\nhalf-superstitious affection for him. Eugene had shown her sympathy\nand devotion at a crisis when a woman sees no pity, no real comfort\nin any eyes; when if a man is ready with soothing flatteries, it is\nbecause he has an interested motive.",
        "Rastignac made up his mind that he must learn the whole of Goriot’s\nprevious history; he would come to his bearings before attempting to\nboard the Maison de Nucingen. The results of his inquiries may be\ngiven briefly as follows:–",
        "In the days before the Revolution, Jean-Joachim Goriot was simply a\nworkman in the employ of a vermicelli maker. He was a skilful, thrifty\nworkman, sufficiently enterprising to buy his master’s business when\nthe latter fell a chance victim to the disturbances of 1789. Goriot\nestablished himself in the Rue de la Jussienne, close to the Corn\nExchange. His plain good sense led him to accept the position of\nPresident of the Section, so as to secure for his business the\nprotection of those in power at that dangerous epoch. This prudent\nstep had led to success; the foundations of his fortune were laid in\nthe time of the Scarcity (real or artificial), when the price of grain\nof all kinds rose enormously in Paris. People used to fight for bread\nat the bakers’ doors; while other persons went to the grocers’ shops\nand bought Italian paste foods without brawling over it. It was during\nthis year that Goriot made the money, which, at a later time, was to\ngive him all the advantage of the great capitalist over the small\nbuyer; he had, moreover, the usual luck of average ability; his\nmediocrity was the salvation of him. He excited no one’s envy, it was\nnot even suspected that he was rich till the peril of being rich was\nover, and all his intelligence was concentrated, not on political, but\non commercial speculations. Goriot was an authority second to none on\nall questions relating to corn, flour, and “middlings\"; and the\nproduction, storage, and quality of grain. He could estimate the yield\nof the harvest, and foresee market prices; he bought his cereals in\nSicily, and imported Russian wheat. Any one who had heard him hold\nforth on the regulations that control the importation and exportation\nof grain, who had seen his grasp of the subject, his clear insight\ninto the principles involved, his appreciation of weak points in the\nway that the system worked, would have thought that here was the stuff\nof which a minister is made. Patient, active, and persevering,\nenergetic and prompt in action, he surveyed his business horizon with\nan eagle eye. Nothing there took him by surprise; he foresaw all\nthings, knew all that was happening, and kept his own counsel; he was\na diplomatist in his quick comprehension of a situation; and in the\nroutine of business he was as patient and plodding as a soldier on the\nmarch. But beyond this business horizon he could not see. He used to\nspend his hours of leisure on the threshold of his shop, leaning\nagainst the framework of the door. Take him from his dark little\ncounting-house, and he became once more the rough, slow-witted\nworkman, a man who cannot understand a piece of reasoning, who is\nindifferent to all intellectual pleasures, and falls asleep at the\nplay, a Parisian Dolibom in short, against whose stupidity other minds\nare powerless.",
        "Natures of this kind are nearly all alike; in almost all of them you\nwill find some hidden depth of sublime affection. Two all-absorbing\naffections filled the vermicelli maker’s heart to the exclusion of\nevery other feeling; into them he seemed to put all the forces of his\nnature, as he put the whole power of his brain into the corn trade. He\nhad regarded his wife, the only daughter of a rich farmer of La Brie,\nwith a devout admiration; his love for her had been boundless. Goriot\nhad felt the charm of a lovely and sensitive nature, which, in its\ndelicate strength, was the very opposite of his own. Is there any\ninstinct more deeply implanted in the heart of man than the pride of\nprotection, a protection which is constantly exerted for a fragile and\ndefenceless creature? Join love thereto, the warmth of gratitude that\nall generous souls feel for the source of their pleasures, and you\nhave the explanation of many strange incongruities in human nature.",
        "After seven years of unclouded happiness, Goriot lost his wife. It was\nvery unfortunate for him. She was beginning to gain an ascendency over\nhim in other ways; possibly she might have brought that barren soil\nunder cultivation, she might have widened his ideas and given other\ndirections to his thoughts. But when she was dead, the instinct of\nfatherhood developed in him till it almost became a mania. All the\naffection balked by death seemed to turn to his daughters, and he\nfound full satisfaction for his heart in loving them. More or less\nbrilliant proposals were made to him from time to time; wealthy\nmerchants or farmers with daughters vied with each other in offering\ninducements to him to marry again; but he determined to remain a\nwidower. His father-in-law, the only man for whom he felt a decided\nfriendship, gave out that Goriot had made a vow to be faithful to his\nwife’s memory. The frequenters of the Corn Exchange, who could not\ncomprehend this sublime piece of folly, joked about it among\nthemselves, and found a ridiculous nickname for him. One of them\nventured (after a glass over a bargain) to call him by it, and a blow\nfrom the vermicelli maker’s fist sent him headlong into a gutter in\nthe Rue Oblin. He could think of nothing else when his children were\nconcerned; his love for them made him fidgety and anxious; and this\nwas so well known, that one day a competitor, who wished to get rid of\nhim to secure the field to himself, told Goriot that Delphine had just\nbeen knocked down by a cab. The vermicelli maker turned ghastly pale,\nleft the Exchange at once, and did not return for several days\nafterwards; he was ill in consequence of the shock and the subsequent\nrelief on discovering that it was a false alarm. This time, however,\nthe offender did not escape with a bruised shoulder; at a critical\nmoment in the man’s affairs, Goriot drove him into bankruptcy, and\nforced him to disappear from the Corn Exchange.",
        "As might have been expected, the two girls were spoiled. With an\nincome of sixty thousand francs, Goriot scarcely spent twelve hundred\non himself, and found all his happiness in satisfying the whims of the\ntwo girls. The best masters were engaged, that Anastasie and Delphine\nmight be endowed with all the accomplishments which distinguish a good\neducation. They had a chaperon–luckily for them, she was a woman who\nhad good sense and good taste;–they learned to ride; they had a\ncarriage for their use; they lived as the mistress of a rich old lord\nmight live; they had only to express a wish, their father would hasten\nto give them their most extravagant desires, and asked nothing of them\nin return but a kiss. Goriot had raised the two girls to the level of\nthe angels; and, quite naturally, he himself was left beneath them.\nPoor man! he loved them even for the pain that they gave him.",
        "When the girls were old enough to be married, they were left free to\nchoose for themselves. Each had half her father’s fortune as her\ndowry; and when the Comte de Restaud came to woo Anastasie for her\nbeauty, her social aspirations led her to leave her father’s house for\na more exalted sphere. Delphine wished for money; she married\nNucingen, a banker of German extraction, who became a Baron of the\nHoly Roman Empire. Goriot remained a vermicelli maker as before. His\ndaughters and his sons-in-law began to demur; they did not like to see\nhim still engaged in trade, though his whole life was bound up with\nhis business. For five years he stood out against their entreaties,\nthen he yielded, and consented to retire on the amount realized by the\nsale of his business and the savings of the last few years. It was\nthis capital that Mme. Vauquer, in the early days of his residence\nwith her, had calculated would bring in eight or ten thousand livres\nin a year. He had taken refuge in her lodging-house, driven there by\ndespair when he knew that his daughters were compelled by their\nhusbands not only to refuse to receive him as an inmate in their\nhouses, but even to see him no more except in private.",
        "This was all the information which Rastignac gained from a M. Muret\nwho had purchased Goriot’s business, information which confirmed the\nDuchesse de Langeais’ suppositions, and herewith the preliminary\nexplanation of this obscure but terrible Parisian tragedy comes to an\nend.",
        "Towards the end of the first week in December Rastignac received two\nletters–one from his mother, and one from his eldest sister. His\nheart beat fast, half with happiness, half with fear, at the sight of\nthe familiar handwriting. Those two little scraps of paper contained\nlife or death for his hopes. But while he felt a shiver of dread as he\nremembered their dire poverty at home, he knew their love for him so\nwell that he could not help fearing that he was draining their very\nlife-blood. His mother’s letter ran as follows:–",
        " “MY DEAR CHILD,–I am sending you the money that you asked for.\n  Make a good use of it. Even to save your life I could not raise so\n  large a sum a second time without your father’s knowledge, and\n  there would be trouble about it. We should be obliged to mortgage\n  the land. It is impossible to judge of the merits of schemes of\n  which I am ignorant; but what sort of schemes can they be, that\n  you should fear to tell me about them? Volumes of explanation\n  would not have been needed; we mothers can understand at a word,\n  and that word would have spared me the anguish of uncertainty. I\n  do not know how to hide the painful impression that your letter\n  has made upon me, my dear son. What can you have felt when you\n  were moved to send this chill of dread through my heart? It must\n  have been very painful to you to write the letter that gave me so\n  much pain as I read it. To what courses are you committed? You are\n  going to appear to be something that you are not, and your whole\n  life and success depends upon this? You are about to see a society\n  into which you cannot enter without rushing into expense that you\n  cannot afford, without losing precious time that is needed for\n  your studies. Ah! my dear Eugene, believe your mother, crooked\n  ways cannot lead to great ends. Patience and endurance are the two\n  qualities most needed in your position. I am not scolding you; I\n  do not want any tinge of bitterness to spoil our offering. I am\n  only talking like a mother whose trust in you is as great as her\n  foresight for you. You know the steps that you must take, and I,\n  for my part, know the purity of heart, and how good your\n  intentions are; so I can say to you without a doubt, ’Go forward,\n  beloved!’ If I tremble, it is because I am a mother, but my\n  prayers and blessings will be with you at every step. Be very\n  careful, dear boy. You must have a man’s prudence, for it lies\n  with you to shape the destinies of five others who are dear to\n  you, and must look to you. Yes, our fortunes depend upon you, and\n  your success is ours. We all pray to God to be with you in all\n  that you do. Your aunt Marcillac has been most generous beyond\n  words in this matter; she saw at once how it was, even down to\n  your gloves. ’But I have a weakness for the eldest!’ she said\n  gaily. You must love your aunt very much, dear Eugene. I shall\n  wait till you have succeeded before telling you all that she has\n  done for you, or her money would burn your fingers. You, who are\n  young, do not know what it is to part with something that is a\n  piece of your past! But what would we not sacrifice for your\n  sakes? Your aunt says that I am to send you a kiss on the forehead\n  from her, and that kiss is to bring you luck again and again, she\n  says. She would have written you herself, the dear kind-hearted\n  woman, but she is troubled with the gout in her fingers just now.\n  Your father is very well. The vintage of 1819 has turned out\n  better than we expected. Good-bye, dear boy; I will say nothing\n  about your sisters, because Laure is writing to you, and I must\n  let her have the pleasure of giving you all the home news. Heaven\n  send that you may succeed! Oh! yes, dear Eugene, you must succeed.\n  I have come, through you, to a knowledge of a pain so sharp that I\n  do not think I could endure it a second time. I have come to know\n  what it is to be poor, and to long for money for my children’s\n  sake. There, good-bye! Do not leave us for long without news of\n  you; and here, at the last, take a kiss from your mother.”",
        "By the time Eugene had finished the letter he was in tears. He thought\nof Father Goriot crushing his silver keepsake into a shapeless mass\nbefore he sold it to meet his daughter’s bill of exchange.",
        "“Your mother has broken up her jewels for you,” he said to himself;\n“your aunt shed tears over those relics of hers before she sold them\nfor your sake. What right have you to heap execrations on Anastasie?\nYou have followed her example; you have selfishly sacrificed others to\nyour own future, and she sacrifices her father to her lover; and of\nyou two, which is the worse?”",
        "He was ready to renounce his attempts; he could not bear to take that\nmoney. The fires of remorse burned in his heart, and gave him\nintolerable pain, the generous secret remorse which men seldom take\ninto account when they sit in judgment upon their fellow-men; but\nperhaps the angels in heaven, beholding it, pardon the criminal whom\nour justice condemns. Rastignac opened his sister’s letter; its\nsimplicity and kindness revived his heart.",
        " “Your letter came just at the right time, dear brother. Agathe and\n  I had thought of so many different ways of spending our money,\n  that we did not know what to buy with it; and now you have come\n  in, and, like the servant who upset all the watches that belonged\n  to the King of Spain, you have restored harmony; for, really and\n  truly, we did not know which of all the things we wanted we wanted\n  most, and we were always quarreling about it, never thinking, dear\n  Eugene, of a way of spending our money which would satisfy us\n  completely. Agathe jumped for you. Indeed, we have been like two\n  mad things all day, ’to such a prodigious degree’ (as aunt would\n  say), that mother said, with her severe expression, ’Whatever can\n  be the matter with you, mesdemoiselles?’ I think if we had been\n  scolded a little, we should have been still better pleased. A\n  woman ought to be very glad to suffer for one she loves! I,\n  however, in my inmost soul, was doleful and cross in the midst of\n  all my joy. I shall make a bad wife, I am afraid, I am too fond of\n  spending. I had bought two sashes and a nice little stiletto for\n  piercing eyelet-holes in my stays, trifles that I really did not\n  want, so that I have less than that slow-coach Agathe, who is so\n  economical, and hoards her money like a magpie. She had two\n  hundred francs! And I have only one hundred and fifty! I am nicely\n  punished; I could throw my sash down the well; it will be painful\n  to me to wear it now. Poor dear, I have robbed you. And Agathe was\n  so nice about it. She said, ’Let us send the three hundred and\n  fifty francs in our two names!’ But I could not help telling you\n  everything just as it happened.",
        " “Do you know how we managed to keep your commandments? We took our\n  glittering hoard, we went out for a walk, and when once fairly on\n  the highway we ran all the way to Ruffec, where we handed over the\n  coin, without more ado, to M. Grimbert of the Messageries Royales.\n  We came back again like swallows on the wing. ’Don’t you think\n  that happiness has made us lighter?’ Agathe said. We said all\n  sorts of things, which I shall not tell you, Monsieur le Parisien,\n  because they were all about you. Oh, we love you dearly, dear\n  brother; it was all summed up in those few words. As for keeping\n  the secret, little masqueraders like us are capable of anything\n  (according to our aunt), even of holding our tongues. Our mother\n  has been on a mysterious journey to Angouleme, and the aunt went\n  with her, not without solemn councils, from which we were shut\n  out, and M. le Baron likewise. They are silent as to the weighty\n  political considerations that prompted their mission, and\n  conjectures are rife in the State of Rastignac. The Infantas are\n  embroidering a muslin robe with open-work sprigs for her Majesty\n  the Queen; the work progresses in the most profound secrecy. There\n  be but two more breadths to finish. A decree has gone forth that\n  no wall shall be built on the side of Verteuil, but that a hedge\n  shall be planted instead thereof. Our subjects may sustain some\n  disappointment of fruit and espaliers, but strangers will enjoy\n  a fair prospect. Should the heir-presumptive lack\n  pocket-handkerchiefs, be it known unto him that the dowager Lady\n  of Marcillac, exploring the recesses of her drawers and boxes\n  (known respectively as Pompeii and Herculaneum), having brought to\n  light a fair piece of cambric whereof she wotted not, the Princesses\n  Agathe and Laure place at their brother’s disposal their thread,\n  their needles, and hands somewhat of the reddest. The two young\n  Princes, Don Henri and Don Gabriel, retain their fatal habits of\n  stuffing themselves with grape-jelly, of teasing their sisters, of\n  taking their pleasure by going a-bird-nesting, and of cutting\n  switches for themselves from the osier-beds, maugre the laws of\n  the realm. Moreover, they list not to learn naught, wherefore the\n  Papal Nuncio (called of the commonalty, M. le Cure) threateneth\n  them with excommunication, since that they neglect the sacred\n  canons of grammatical construction for the construction of other\n  canon, deadly engines made of the stems of elder.",
        " “Farewell, dear brother, never did letter carry so many wishes for\n  your success, so much love fully satisfied. You will have a great\n  deal to tell us when you come home! You will tell me everything,\n  won’t you? I am the oldest. From something the aunt let fall, we\n  think you must have had some success.",
        " “Something was said of a lady, but nothing more was said . . .",
        " “Of course not, in our family! Oh, by-the-by, Eugene, would you\n  rather that we made that piece of cambric into shirts for you\n  instead of pocket-handkerchiefs? If you want some really nice\n  shirts at once, we ought to lose no time in beginning upon them;\n  and if the fashion is different now in Paris, send us one for a\n  pattern; we want more particularly to know about the cuffs. Good-\n  bye! Good-bye! Take my kiss on the left side of your forehead, on\n  the temple that belongs to me, and to no one else in the world. I\n  am leaving the other side of the sheet for Agathe, who has\n  solemnly promised not to read a word that I have written; but, all\n  the same, I mean to sit by her side while she writes, so as to be\n  quite sure that she keeps her word.–Your loving sister,",
        "“Laure De Rastignac.”",
        "“Yes!” said Eugene to himself. “Yes! Success at all costs now! Riches\ncould not repay such devotion as this. I wish I could give them every\nsort of happiness! Fifteen hundred and fifty francs,” he went on after\na pause. “Every shot must go to the mark! Laure is right. Trust a\nwoman! I have only calico shirts. Where some one else’s welfare is\nconcerned, a young girl becomes as ingenious as a thief. Guileless\nwhere she herself is in question, and full of foresight for me,–she\nis like a heavenly angel forgiving the strange incomprehensible sins\nof earth.”",
        "The world lay before him. His tailor had been summoned and sounded,\nand had finally surrendered. When Rastignac met M. de Trailles, he had\nseen at once how great a part the tailor plays in a young man’s\ncareer; a tailor is either a deadly enemy or a staunch friend, with an\ninvoice for a bond of friendship; between these two extremes there is,\nalack! no middle term. In this representative of his craft Eugene\ndiscovered a man who understood that his was a sort of paternal\nfunction for young men at their entrance into life, who regarded\nhimself as a stepping-stone between a young man’s present and future.\nAnd Rastignac in gratitude made the man’s fortune by an epigram of a\nkind in which he excelled at a later period of his life.",
        "“I have twice known a pair of trousers turned out by him make a match\nof twenty thousand livres a year!”",
        "Fifteen hundred francs, and as many suits of clothes as he chose to\norder! At that moment the poor child of the South felt no more doubts\nof any kind. The young man went down to breakfast with the indefinable\nair which the consciousness of the possession of money gives to youth.\nNo sooner are the coins slipped into a student’s pocket than his\nwealth, in imagination at least, is piled into a fantastic column,\nwhich affords him a moral support. He begins to hold up his head as he\nwalks; he is conscious that he has a means of bringing his powers to\nbear on a given point; he looks you straight in the face; his gestures\nare quick and decided; only yesterday he was diffident and shy, any\none might have pushed him aside; to-morrow, he will take the wall of a\nprime minister. A miracle has been wrought in him. Nothing is beyond\nthe reach of his ambition, and his ambition soars at random; he is\nlight-hearted, generous, and enthusiastic; in short, the fledgling\nbird has discovered that he has wings. A poor student snatches at\nevery chance pleasure much as a dog runs all sorts of risks to steal a\nbone, cracking it and sucking the marrow as he flies from pursuit; but\na young man who can rattle a few runaway gold coins in his pocket can\ntake his pleasure deliberately, can taste the whole of the sweets of\nsecure possession; he soars far above earth; he has forgotten what the\nword poverty means; all Paris is his. Those are days when the whole\nworld shines radiant with light, when everything glows and sparkles\nbefore the eyes of youth, days that bring joyous energy that is never\nbrought into harness, days of debts and of painful fears that go hand\nin hand with every delight. Those who do not know the left bank of the\nSeine between the Rue Saint-Jacques and the Rue des Saints-Peres know\nnothing of life.",
        "“Ah! if the women of Paris but knew,” said Rastignac, as he devoured\nMme. Vauquer’s stewed pears (at five for a penny), “they would come\nhere in search of a lover.”",
        "Just then a porter from the Messageries Royales appeared at the door\nof the room; they had previously heard the bell ring as the wicket\nopened to admit him. The man asked for M. Eugene de Rastignac, holding\nout two bags for him to take, and a form of receipt for his signature.\nVautrin’s keen glance cut Eugene like a lash.",
        "“Now you will be able to pay for those fencing lessons and go to the\nshooting gallery,” he said.",
        "“Your ship has come in,” said Mme. Vauquer, eyeing the bags.",
        "Mlle. Michonneau did not dare to look at the money, for fear her eyes\nshould betray her cupidity.",
        "“You have a kind mother,” said Mme. Couture.",
        "“You have a kind mother, sir,” echoed Poiret.",
        "“Yes, mamma has been drained dry,” said Vautrin, “and now you can have\nyour fling, go into society, and fish for heiresses, and dance with\ncountesses who have peach blossom in their hair. But take my advice,\nyoung man, and don’t neglect your pistol practice.”",
        "Vautrin struck an attitude, as if he were facing an antagonist.\nRastignac, meaning to give the porter a tip, felt in his pockets and\nfound nothing. Vautrin flung down a franc piece on the table.",
        "“Your credit is good,” he remarked, eyeing the student, and Rastignac\nwas forced to thank him, though, since the sharp encounter of wits at\ndinner that day, after Eugene came in from calling on Mme. de\nBeauseant, he had made up his mind that Vautrin was insufferable. For\na week, in fact, they had both kept silence in each other’s presence,\nand watched each other. The student tried in vain to account to\nhimself for this attitude.",
        "An idea, of course, gains in force by the energy with which it is\nexpressed; it strikes where the brain sends it, by a law as\nmathematically exact as the law that determines the course of a shell\nfrom a mortar. The amount of impression it makes is not to be\ndetermined so exactly. Sometimes, in an impressible nature, the idea\nworks havoc, but there are, no less, natures so robustly protected,\nthat this sort of projectile falls flat and harmless on skulls of\ntriple brass, as cannon-shot against solid masonry; then there are\nflaccid and spongy-fibred natures into which ideas from without sink\nlike spent bullets into the earthworks of a redoubt. Rastignac’s head\nwas something of the powder-magazine order; the least shock sufficed\nto bring about an explosion. He was too quick, too young, not to be\nreadily accessible to ideas; and open to that subtle influence of\nthought and feeling in others which causes so many strange phenomena\nthat make an impression upon us of which we are all unconscious at the\ntime. Nothing escaped his mental vision; he was lynx-eyed; in him the\nmental powers of perception, which seem like duplicates of the senses,\nhad the mysterious power of swift projection that astonishes us in\nintellects of a high order–slingers who are quick to detect the weak\nspot in any armor.",
        "In the past month Eugene’s good qualities and defects had rapidly\ndeveloped with his character. Intercourse with the world and the\nendeavor to satisfy his growing desires had brought out his defects.\nBut Rastignac came from the South side of the Loire, and had the good\nqualities of his countrymen. He had the impetuous courage of the\nSouth, that rushes to the attack of a difficulty, as well as the\nsouthern impatience of delay or suspense. These traits are held to be\ndefects in the North; they made the fortune of Murat, but they\nlikewise cut short his career. The moral would appear to be that when\nthe dash and boldness of the South side of the Loire meets, in a\nsouthern temperament, with the guile of the North, the character is\ncomplete, and such a man will gain (and keep) the crown of Sweden.",
        "Rastignac, therefore, could not stand the fire from Vautrin’s\nbatteries for long without discovering whether this was a friend or a\nfoe. He felt as if this strange being was reading his inmost soul, and\ndissecting his feelings, while Vautrin himself was so close and\nsecretive that he seemed to have something of the profound and unmoved\nserenity of a sphinx, seeing and hearing all things and saying\nnothing. Eugene, conscious of that money in his pocket, grew\nrebellious.",
        "“Be so good as to wait a moment,” he said to Vautrin, as the latter\nrose, after slowly emptying his coffee-cup, sip by sip.",
        "“What for?” inquired the older man, as he put on his large-brimmed\nhat and took up the sword-cane that he was wont to twirl like a man\nwho will face three or four footpads without flinching.",
        "“I will repay you in a minute,” returned Eugene. He unsealed one of\nthe bags as he spoke, counted out a hundred and forty francs, and\npushed them towards Mme. Vauquer. “Short reckonings make good friends\"\nhe added, turning to the widow; “that clears our accounts till the end\nof the year. Can you give me change for a five-franc piece?”",
        "“Good friends make short reckonings,” echoed Poiret, with a glance at\nVautrin.",
        "“Here is your franc,” said Rastignac, holding out the coin to the\nsphinx in the black wig.",
        "“Any one might think that you were afraid to owe me a trifle,\"\nexclaimed this latter, with a searching glance that seemed to read the\nyoung man’s inmost thoughts; there was a satirical and cynical smile\non Vautrin’s face such as Eugene had seen scores of times already;\nevery time he saw it, it exasperated him almost beyond endurance.",
        "“Well . . . so I am,” he answered. He held both the bags in his hand,\nand had risen to go up to his room.",
        "Vautrin made as if he were going out through the sitting-room, and the\nstudent turned to go through the second door that opened into the\nsquare lobby at the foot of the staircase.",
        "“Do you know, Monsieur le Marquis de Rastignacorama, that what you\nwere saying just now was not exactly polite?” Vautrin remarked, as he\nrattled his sword-cane across the panels of the sitting-room door, and\ncame up to the student.",
        "Rastignac looked coolly at Vautrin, drew him to the foot of the\nstaircase, and shut the dining-room door. They were standing in the\nlittle square lobby between the kitchen and the dining-room; the place\nwas lighted by an iron-barred fanlight above a door that gave access\ninto the garden. Sylvie came out of her kitchen, and Eugene chose that\nmoment to say:",
        "“Monsieur Vautrin, I am not a marquis, and my name is not\nRastignacorama.”",
        "“They will fight,” said Mlle. Michonneau, in an indifferent tone.",
        "“Fight!” echoed Poiret.",
        "“Not they,” replied Mme. Vauquer, lovingly fingering her pile of\ncoins.",
        "“But there they are under the lime-trees,” cried Mlle. Victorine, who\nhad risen so that she might see out into the garden. “Poor young man!\nhe was in the right, after all.”",
        "“We must go upstairs, my pet,” said Mme. Couture; “it is no business\nof ours.”",
        "At the door, however, Mme. Couture and Victorine found their progress\nbarred by the portly form of Sylvie the cook.",
        "“What ever can have happened?” she said. “M. Vautrin said to M.\nEugene, ’Let us have an explanation!’ then he took him by the arm, and\nthere they are, out among the artichokes.”",
        "Vautrin came in while she was speaking. “Mamma Vauquer,” he said\nsmiling, “don’t frighten yourself at all. I am only going to try my\npistols under the lime-trees.”",
        "“Oh! monsieur,” cried Victorine, clasping her hands as she spoke, “why\ndo you want to kill M. Eugene?”",
        "Vautrin stepped back a pace or two, and gazed at Victorine.",
        "“Oh! this is something fresh!” he exclaimed in a bantering tone, that\nbrought the color into the poor girl’s face. “That young fellow yonder\nis very nice, isn’t he?” he went on. “You have given me a notion, my\npretty child; I will make you both happy.”",
        "Mme. Couture laid her hand on the arm of her ward, and drew the girl\naway, as she said in her ear:",
        "“Why, Victorine, I cannot imagine what has come over you this\nmorning.”",
        "“I don’t want any shots fired in my garden,” said Mme. Vauquer. “You\nwill frighten the neighborhood and bring the police up here all in a\nmoment.”",
        "“Come, keep cool, Mamma Vauquer,” answered Vautrin. “There, there;\nit’s all right; we will go to the shooting-gallery.”",
        "He went back to Rastignac, laying his hand familiarly on the young\nman’s arm.",
        "“When I have given you ocular demonstration of the fact that I can put\na bullet through the ace on a card five times running at thirty-five\npaces,” he said, “that won’t take away your appetite, I suppose? You\nlook to me to be inclined to be a trifle quarrelsome this morning, and\nas if you would rush on your death like a blockhead.”",
        "“Do you draw back?” asked Eugene.",
        "“Don’t try to raise my temperature,” answered Vautrin, “it is not cold\nthis morning. Let us go and sit over there,” he added, pointing to the\ngreen-painted garden seats; “no one can overhear us. I want a little\ntalk with you. You are not a bad sort of youngster, and I have no\nquarrel with you. I like you, take Trump–(confound it!)–take\nVautrin’s word for it. What makes me like you? I will tell you\nby-and-by. Meantime, I can tell you that I know you as well as if I\nhad made you myself, as I will prove to you in a minute. Put down your\nbags,” he continued, pointing to the round table.",
        "Rastignac deposited his money on the table, and sat down. He was\nconsumed with curiosity, which the sudden change in the manner of the\nman before him had excited to the highest pitch. Here was a strange\nbeing who, a moment ago, had talked of killing him, and now posed as\nhis protector.",
