        "THE King was a man that stood well before the world; his smile was \nsweet as clover, but his soul withinsides was as little as a pea.  \nHe had two sons; and the younger son was a boy after his heart, but \nthe elder was one whom he feared.  It befell one morning that the \ndrum sounded in the dun before it was yet day; and the King rode \nwith his two sons, and a brave array behind them.  They rode two \nhours, and came to the foot of a brown mountain that was very \nsteep.",
        "“Where do we ride?” said the elder son.",
        "“Across this brown mountain.” said the King, and smiled to himself.",
        "“My father knows what he is doing,” said the younger son.",
        "And they rode two hours more, and came to the sides of a black \nriver that was wondrous deep.",
        "“And where do we ride?” asked the elder son.",
        "“Over this black river,” said the King, and smiled to himself.",
        "“My father knows what he is doing,” said the younger son.",
        "And they rode all that day, and about the time of the sunsetting \ncame to the side of a lake, where was a great dun.",
        "“It is here we ride,” said the King; “to a King’s house, and a \npriest’s, and a house where you will learn much.”",
        "At the gates of the dun, the King who was a priest met them; and he \nwas a grave man, and beside him stood his daughter, and she was as \nfair as the morn, and one that smiled and looked down.",
        "“These are my two sons,” said the first King.",
        "“And here is my daughter,” said the King who was a priest.",
        "“She is a wonderful fine maid,” said the first King, “and I like \nher manner of smiling,”",
        "“They are wonderful well-grown lads,” said the second, “and I like \ntheir gravity.”",
        "And then the two Kings looked at each other, and said, “The thing \nmay come about”.",
        "And in the meanwhile the two lads looked upon the maid, and the one \ngrew pale and the other red; and the maid looked upon the ground \nsmiling.",
        "“Here is the maid that I shall marry,” said the elder.  “For I \nthink she smiled upon me.”",
        "But the younger plucked his father by the sleeve.  “Father,” said \nhe, “a word in your ear.  If I find favour in your sight, might not \nI wed this maid, for I think she smiles upon me?”",
        "“A word in yours,” said the King his father.  “Waiting is good \nhunting, and when the teeth are shut the tongue is at home.”",
        "Now they were come into the dun, and feasted; and this was a great \nhouse, so that the lads were astonished; and the King that was a \npriest sat at the end of the board and was silent, so that the lads \nwere filled with reverence; and the maid served them smiling with \ndowncast eyes, so that their hearts were enlarged.",
        "Before it was day, the elder son arose, and he found the maid at \nher weaving, for she was a diligent girl.  “Maid,” quoth he, “I \nwould fain marry you.”",
        "“You must speak with my father,” said she, and she looked upon the \nground smiling, and became like the rose.",
        "“Her heart is with me,” said the elder son, and he went down to the \nlake and sang.",
        "A little after came the younger son.  “Maid,” quoth he, “if our \nfathers were agreed, I would like well to marry you.”",
        "“You can speak to my father,” said she; and looked upon the ground, \nand smiled and grew like the rose.",
        "“She is a dutiful daughter,” said the younger son, “she will make \nan obedient wife.”  And then he thought, “What shall I do?” and he \nremembered the King her father was a priest; so he went into the \ntemple, and sacrificed a weasel and a hare.",
        "Presently the news got about; and the two lads and the first King \nwere called into the presence of the King who was a priest, where \nhe sat upon the high seat.",
        "“Little I reck of gear,” said the King who was a priest, “and \nlittle of power.  For we live here among the shadow of things, and \nthe heart is sick of seeing them.  And we stay here in the wind \nlike raiment drying, and the heart is weary of the wind.  But one \nthing I love, and that is truth; and for one thing will I give my \ndaughter, and that is the trial stone.  For in the light of that \nstone the seeming goes, and the being shows, and all things besides \nare worthless.  Therefore, lads, if ye would wed my daughter, out \nfoot, and bring me the stone of touch, for that is the price of \nher.”",
        "“A word in your ear,” said the younger son to his father.  “I think \nwe do very well without this stone.”",
        "“A word in yours,” said the father.  “I am of your way of thinking; \nbut when the teeth are shut the tongue is at home.”  And he smiled \nto the King that was a priest.",
        "But the elder son got to his feet, and called the King that was a \npriest by the name of father.  “For whether I marry the maid or no, \nI will call you by that word for the love of your wisdom; and even \nnow I will ride forth and search the world for the stone of touch.”  \nSo he said farewell, and rode into the world.",
        "“I think I will go, too,” said the younger son, “if I can have your \nleave.  For my heart goes out to the maid.”",
        "“You will ride home with me,” said his father.",
        "So they rode home, and when they came to the dun, the King had his \nson into his treasury.  “Here,” said he, “is the touchstone which \nshows truth; for there is no truth but plain truth; and if you will \nlook in this, you will see yourself as you are.”",
        "And the younger son looked in it, and saw his face as it were the \nface of a beardless youth, and he was well enough pleased; for the \nthing was a piece of a mirror.",
        "“Here is no such great thing to make a work about,” said he; “but \nif it will get me the maid I shall never complain.  But what a fool \nis my brother to ride into the world, and the thing all the while \nat home!”",
        "So they rode back to the other dun, and showed the mirror to the \nKing that was a priest; and when he had looked in it, and seen \nhimself like a King, and his house like a King’s house, and all \nthings like themselves, he cried out and blessed God.  “For now I \nknow,” said he, “there is no truth but the plain truth; and I am a \nKing indeed, although my heart misgave me.”  And he pulled down his \ntemple, and built a new one; and then the younger son was married \nto the maid.",
        "In the meantime the elder son rode into the world to find the \ntouchstone of the trial of truth; and whenever he came to a place \nof habitation, he would ask the men if they had heard of it.  And \nin every place the men answered: “Not only have we heard of it, but \nwe alone, of all men, possess the thing itself, and it hangs in the \nside of our chimney to this day”.  Then would the elder son be \nglad, and beg for a sight of it.  And sometimes it would be a piece \nof mirror, that showed the seeming of things; and then he would \nsay, “This can never be, for there should be more than seeming”.  \nAnd sometimes it would be a lump of coal, which showed nothing; and \nthen he would say, “This can never be, for at least there is the \nseeming”.  And sometimes it would be a touchstone indeed, beautiful \nin hue, adorned with polishing, the light inhabiting its sides; and \nwhen he found this, he would beg the thing, and the persons of that \nplace would give it him, for all men were very generous of that \ngift; so that at the last he had his wallet full of them, and they \nchinked together when he rode; and when he halted by the side of \nthe way he would take them out and try them, till his head turned \nlike the sails upon a windmill.",
        "“A murrain upon this business!” said the elder son, “for I perceive \nno end to it.  Here I have the red, and here the blue and the \ngreen; and to me they seem all excellent, and yet shame each other.  \nA murrain on the trade!  If it were not for the King that is a \npriest and whom I have called my father, and if it were not for the \nfair maid of the dun that makes my mouth to sing and my heart \nenlarge, I would even tumble them all into the salt sea, and go \nhome and be a King like other folk.”",
        "But he was like the hunter that has seen a stag upon a mountain, so \nthat the night may fall, and the fire be kindled, and the lights \nshine in his house; but desire of that stag is single in his bosom.",
        "Now after many years the elder son came upon the sides of the salt \nsea; and it was night, and a savage place, and the clamour of the \nsea was loud.  There he was aware of a house, and a man that sat \nthere by the light of a candle, for he had no fire.  Now the elder \nson came in to him, and the man gave him water to drink, for he had \nno bread; and wagged his head when he was spoken to, for he had no \nwords.",
        "“Have you the touchstone of truth?” asked the elder son and when \nthe man had wagged his head, “I might have known that,” cried the \nelder son.  “I have here a wallet full of them!”  And with that he \nlaughed, although his heart was weary.",
        "And with that the man laughed too, and with the fuff of his \nlaughter the candle went out.",
        "“Sleep,” said the man, “for now I think you have come far enough; \nand your quest is ended, and my candle is out.”",
        "Now when the morning came, the man gave him a clear pebble in his \nhand, and it had no beauty and no colour; and the elder son looked \nupon it scornfully and shook his head; and he went away, for it \nseemed a small affair to him.",
        "All that day he rode, and his mind was quiet, and the desire of the \nchase allayed.  “How if this poor pebble be the touchstone, after \nall?” said he: and he got down from his horse, and emptied forth \nhis wallet by the side of the way.  Now, in the light of each \nother, all the touchstones lost their hue and fire, and withered \nlike stars at morning; but in the light of the pebble, their beauty \nremained, only the pebble was the most bright.  And the elder son \nsmote upon his brow.  “How if this be the truth?” he cried, “that \nall are a little true?”  And he took the pebble, and turned its \nlight upon the heavens, and they deepened about him like the pit; \nand he turned it on the hills, and the hills were cold and rugged, \nbut life ran in their sides so that his own life bounded; and he \nturned it on the dust, and he beheld the dust with joy and terror; \nand he turned it on himself, and kneeled down and prayed.",
        "“Now, thanks be to God,” said the elder son, “I have found the \ntouchstone; and now I may turn my reins, and ride home to the King \nand to the maid of the dun that makes my mouth to sing and my heart \nenlarge.”",
        "Now when he came to the dun, he saw children playing by the gate \nwhere the King had met him in the old days; and this stayed his \npleasure, for he thought in his heart, “It is here my children \nshould be playing”.  And when he came into the hall, there was his \nbrother on the high seat and the maid beside him; and at that his \nanger rose, for he thought in his heart, “It is I that should be \nsitting there, and the maid beside me”.",
        "“Who are you?” said his brother.  “And what make you in the dun?”",
        "“I am your elder brother,” he replied.  “And I am come to marry the \nmaid, for I have brought the touchstone of truth.”",
        "Then the younger brother laughed aloud.  “Why,” said he, “I found \nthe touchstone years ago, and married the maid, and there are our \nchildren playing at the gate.”",
        "Now at this the elder brother grew as gray as the dawn.  “I pray \nyou have dealt justly,” said he, “for I perceive my life is lost.”",
        "“Justly?” quoth the younger brother.  “It becomes you ill, that are \na restless man and a runagate, to doubt my justice, or the King my \nfather’s, that are sedentary folk and known in the land.”",
        "“Nay,” said the elder brother, “you have all else, have patience \nalso; and suffer me to say the world is full of touchstones, and it \nappears not easily which is true.”",
        "“I have no shame of mine,” said the younger brother.  “There it is, \nand look in it.”",
        "So the elder brother looked in the mirror, and he was sore amazed; \nfor he was an old man, and his hair was white upon his head; and he \nsat down in the hall and wept aloud.",
        "“Now,” said the younger brother, “see what a fool’s part you have \nplayed, that ran over all the world to seek what was lying in our \nfather’s treasury, and came back an old carle for the dogs to bark \nat, and without chick or child.  And I that was dutiful and wise \nsit here crowned with virtues and pleasures, and happy in the light \nof my hearth.”",
        "“Methinks you have a cruel tongue,” said the elder brother; and he \npulled out the clear pebble and turned its light on his brother; \nand behold the man was lying, his soul was shrunk into the \nsmallness of a pea, and his heart was a bag of little fears like \nscorpions, and love was dead in his bosom.  And at that the elder \nbrother cried out aloud, and turned the light of the pebble on the \nmaid, and, lo! she was but a mask of a woman, and withinside’s she \nwas quite dead, and she smiled as a clock ticks, and knew not \nwherefore.",
        "“Oh, well,” said the elder brother, “I perceive there is both good \nand bad.  So fare ye all as well as ye may in the dun; but I will \ngo forth into the world with my pebble in my pocket.”",
