        "  In honour of Chia Ching’s birthday, a family banquet is spread in the\n      Ning Mansion.\n  At the sight of Hsi-feng, Chia Jui entertains feelings of licentious\n      love.",
        "We will now explain, in continuation of our story, that on the day of\nChia Ching’s birthday, Chia Chen began by getting ready luscious\ndelicacies and rare fruits, which he packed in sixteen spacious present\nboxes, and bade Chia Jung take them, along with the servants belonging\nto the household, over to Chia Ching.",
        "Turning round towards Chia Jung: “Mind,” he said, “that you observe\nwhether your grandfather be agreeable or not, before you set to work and\npay your obeisance! ’My father,’ tell him, ’has complied with your\ndirections, venerable senior, and not presumed to come over; but he has\nat home ushered the whole company of the members of the family (into\nyour apartments), where they all paid their homage facing the side of\nhonour.’”",
        "After Chia Jung had listened to these injunctions, he speedily led off\nthe family domestics, and took his departure. During this interval, one\nby one arrived the guests. First came Chia Lien and Chia Se, who went to\nsee whether the seats in the various places (were sufficient). “Is there\nto be any entertainment or not?” they also inquired.",
        "“Our master,” replied the servants, “had, at one time, intended to\ninvite the venerable Mr. Chia Ching to come and spend this day at home,\nand hadn’t for this reason presumed to get up any entertainment. But\nwhen the other day he came to hear that the old gentleman was not\ncoming, he at once gave us orders to go in search of a troupe of young\nactors, as well as a band of musicians, and all these people are now\nengaged making their preparations on the stage in the garden.”",
        "Next came, in a group, mesdames Hsing and Wang, lady Feng and Pao-yü,\nfollowed immediately after by Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu; Mrs. Yu’s mother\nhaving already arrived and being in there in advance of her. Salutations\nwere exchanged between the whole company, and they pressed one another\nto take a seat. Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu both handed the tea round.",
        "“Our venerable lady,” they explained, as they smiled, “is a worthy\nsenior; while our father is, on the other hand, only her nephew; so that\non a birthday of a man of his age, we should really not have had the\naudacity to invite her ladyship; but as the weather, at this time, is\ncool, and the chrysanthemums, in the whole garden, are in luxuriant\nblossom, we have requested our venerable ancestor to come for a little\ndistraction, and to see the whole number of her children and\ngrand-children amuse themselves. This was the object we had in view,\nbut, contrary to our expectations, our worthy senior has not again\nconferred upon us the lustre of her countenance.”",
        "Lady Feng did not wait until madame Wang could open her mouth, but took\nthe initiative to reply. “Our venerable lady,” she urged, “had, even so\nlate as yesterday, said that she meant to come; but, in the evening,\nupon seeing brother Pao eating peaches, the mouth of the old lady once\nagain began to water, and after partaking of a little more than the half\nof one, she had, about the fifth watch, to get out of bed two\nconsecutive times, with the result that all the forenoon to-day, she\nfelt her body considerably worn out. She therefore bade me inform our\nworthy senior that it was utterly impossible for her to come to-day;\nadding however that, if there were any delicacies, she fancied a few\nkinds, but that they should be very tender.”",
        "When Chia Chen heard these words, he smiled. “Our dowager lady,” he\nreplied, “is, I argued, so fond of amusement that, if she doesn’t come\nto-day, there must, for a certainty, be some valid reason; and that’s\nexactly what happens to be the case.”",
        "“The other day I heard your eldest sister explain,” interposed madame\nWang, “that Chia Jung’s wife was anything but well; but what’s after all\nthe matter with her?”",
        "“She has,” observed Mrs. Yu, “contracted this illness verily in a\nstrange manner! Last moon at the time of the mid-autumn festival, she\nwas still well enough to be able to enjoy herself, during half the\nnight, in company with our dowager lady and madame Wang. On her return,\nshe continued in good health, until after the twentieth, when she began\nto feel more and more languid every day, and loth, likewise, to eat\nanything; and this has been going on for well-nigh half a month and\nmore; she hasn’t besides been anything like her old self for two\nmonths.”",
        "“May she not,” remarked madame Hsing, taking up the thread of the\nconversation, “be ailing for some happy event?”",
        "But while she was uttering these words, some one from outside announced:\n\"Our senior master, second master and all the gentlemen of the family\nhave come, and are standing in the Reception Hall!” Whereupon Chia Chen\nand Chia Lien quitted the apartment with hurried step; and during this\nwhile, Mrs. Yu reiterated how that some time ago a doctor had also\nexpressed the opinion that she was ailing for a happy event, but that\nthe previous day, had come a doctor, recommended by Feng Tzu-ying–a\ndoctor, who had from his youth up made medicine his study, and was very\nproficient in the treatment of diseases,–who asserted, after he had\nseen her, that it was no felicitous ailment, but that it was some grave\ncomplaint. “It was only yesterday,” (she explained,) “that he wrote his\nprescription; and all she has had is but one dose, and already to-day\nthe giddiness in the head is considerably better; as regards the other\nsymptoms they have as yet shown no marked improvement.”",
        "“I maintain,” remarked lady Feng, “that, were she not quite unfit to\nstand the exertion, would she in fact, on a day like this, be unwilling\nto strain every nerve and come round.”",
        "“You saw her,” observed Mrs. Yu, “on the third in here; how that she\nbore up with a violent effort for ever so long, but it was all because\nof the friendship that exists between you two, that she still longed for\nyour society, and couldn’t brook the idea of tearing herself away.”",
        "When lady Feng heard these words, her eyes got quite red, and after a\ntime she at length exclaimed: “In the Heavens of a sudden come wind and\nrain; while with man, in a day and in a night, woe and weal survene! But\nwith her tender years, if for a complaint like this she were to run any\nrisk, what pleasure is there for any human being to be born and to\nsojourn in the world?”",
        "She was just speaking, when Chia Jung walked into the apartment; and\nafter paying his respects to madame Hsing, madame Wang, and lady Feng,\nhe then observed to Mrs. Yu: “I have just taken over the eatables to our\nvenerable ancestor; and, at the same time, I told him that my father was\nat home waiting upon the senior, and entertaining the junior gentlemen\nof the whole family, and that in compliance with grandfather’s orders,\nhe did not presume to go over. The old gentleman was much delighted by\nwhat he heard me say, and having signified that that was all in order,\nbade me tell father and you, mother, to do all you can in your\nattendance upon the senior gentlemen and ladies, enjoining me to\nentertain, with all propriety, my uncles, aunts, and my cousins. He also\nwent on to urge me to press the men to cut, with all despatch, the\nblocks for the Record of Meritorious Deeds, and to print ten thousand\ncopies for distribution. All these messages I have duly delivered to my\nfather, but I must now be quick and go out, so as to send the eatables\nfor the elder as well as for the younger gentlemen of the entire\nhousehold.”",
        "“Brother Jung Erh,” exclaimed lady Feng, “wait a moment. How is your\nwife getting on? how is she, after all, to-day?”",
        "“Not well,” replied Chia Jung. “But were you, aunt, on your return to go\nin and see her, you will find out for yourself.”",
        "Chia Jung forthwith left the room. During this interval, Mrs. Yu\naddressed herself to mesdames Hsing and Wang; “My ladies,” she asked,\n\"will you have your repast in here, or will you go into the garden for\nit? There are now in the garden some young actors engaged in making\ntheir preparations?”",
        "“It’s better in here,” madame Wang remarked, as she turned towards\nmadame Hsing.",
        "Mrs. Yu thereupon issued directions to the married women and matrons to\nbe quick in serving the eatables. The servants, in waiting outside the\ndoor, with one voice signified their obedience; and each of them went\noff to fetch what fell to her share. In a short while, the courses were\nall laid out, and Mrs. Yu pressed mesdames Hsing and Wang, as well as\nher mother, into the upper seats; while she, together with lady Feng and\nPao-yü, sat at a side table.",
        "“We’ve come,” observed mesdames Hsing and Wang, “with the original idea\nof paying our congratulations to our venerable senior on the occasion of\nhis birthday; and isn’t this as if we had come for our own birthdays?”",
        "“The old gentleman,” answered lady Feng, “is a man fond of a quiet life;\nand as he has already consummated a process of purification, he may well\nbe looked upon as a supernatural being, so that the purpose to which\nyour ladyships have given expression may be considered as manifest to\nhis spirit, upon the very advent of the intention.”",
        "As this sentence was uttered the whole company in the room burst out\nlaughing. Mrs. Yu’s mother, mesdames Hsing and Wang, and lady Feng\nhaving one and all partaken of the banquet, rinsed their mouths and\nwashed their hands, which over, they expressed a wish to go into the\ngarden.",
        "Chia Jung entered the room. “The senior gentlemen,” he said to Mrs. Yu,\n\"as well as all my uncles and cousins, have finished their repast; but\nthe elder gentleman Mr. Chia She, who excused himself on the score of\nhaving at home something to attend to, and Mr. Secundus (Chia Cheng),\nwho is not partial to theatrical performances and is always afraid that\npeople will be too boisterous in their entertainments, have both of them\ntaken their departure. The rest of the family gentlemen have been taken\nover by uncle Secundus Mr. Lien, and Mr. Se, to the other side to listen\nto the play. A few moments back Prince Nan An, Prince Tung P’ing, Prince\nHsi Ning, Prince Pei Ching, these four Princes, with Niu, Duke of Chen\nKuo, and five other dukes, six in all, and Shih, Marquis of Chung Ching,\nand other seven, in all eight marquises, sent their messengers with\ntheir cards and presents. I have already told father all about it; but\nbefore I did so, the presents were put away in the counting room, the\nlists of presents were all entered in the book, and the ’received with\nthanks’ cards were handed to the respective messengers of the various\nmansions; the men themselves were also tipped in the customary manner,\nand all of them were kept to have something to eat before they went on\ntheir way. But, mother, you should invite the two ladies, your mother\nand my aunt, to go over and sit in the garden.”",
        "“Just so!” observed Mrs. Yu, “but we’ve only now finished our repast,\nand were about to go over.”",
        "“I wish to tell you, madame,” interposed lady Feng, “that I shall go\nfirst and see brother Jung’s wife and then come and join you.”",
        "“All right,” replied madame Wang; “we should all have been fain to have\npaid her a visit, did we not fear lest she should look upon our\ndisturbing her with displeasure, but just tell her that we would like to\nknow how she is getting on!”",
        "“My dear sister,” remarked Mrs. Yu, “as our son’s wife has a ready ear\nfor all you say, do go and cheer her up, (and if you do so,) it will\nbesides set my own mind at ease; but be quick and come as soon as you\ncan into the garden.”",
        "Pao-yü being likewise desirous to go along with lady Feng to see lady\nCh’in, madame Wang remarked, “Go and see her just for a while, and then\ncome over at once into the garden; (for remember) she is your nephew’s\nwife, (and you couldn’t sit in there long).”",
        "Mrs. Yu forthwith invited mesdames Wang and Hsing, as well as her own\nmother, to adjourn to the other side, and they all in a body walked into\nthe garden of Concentrated Fragrance; while lady Feng and Pao-yü betook\nthemselves, in company with Chia Jung, over to this side.",
        "Having entered the door, they with quiet step walked as far as the\nentrance of the inner chamber. Mrs. Ch’in, upon catching sight of them,\nwas bent upon getting up; but “Be quick,” remonstrated lady Feng, “and\ngive up all idea of standing up; for take care your head will feel\ndizzy.”",
        "Lady Feng hastened to make a few hurried steps forward and to grasp Mrs.\nCh’in’s hand in hers. “My dear girl!” she exclaimed; “How is it that\nduring the few days I’ve not seen you, you have grown so thin?”",
        "Readily she then took a seat on the rug, on which Mrs. Ch’in was seated,\nwhile Pao-yü, after inquiring too about her health, sat in the chair on\nthe opposite side.",
        "“Bring the tea in at once,” called out Chia Jung, “for aunt and uncle\nSecundus have not had any tea in the drawing room.”",
        "Mrs. Ch’in took lady Feng’s hand in her own and forced a smile. “This is\nall due to my lack of good fortune; for in such a family as this, my\nfather and mother-in-law treat me just as if I were a daughter of their\nown flesh and blood! Besides, your nephew, (my husband,) may, it is\ntrue, my dear aunt, be young in years, but he is full of regard for me,\nas I have regard for him, and we have had so far no misunderstanding\nbetween us! In fact, among the senior generation, as well as that of the\nsame age as myself, in the whole clan, putting you aside, aunt, about\nwhom no mention need be made, there is not one who has not ever had\nanything but love for me, and not one who has not ever shown me anything\nbut kindness! But since I’ve fallen ill with this complaint, all my\nenergy has even every bit of it been taken out of me, so that I’ve been\nunable to show to my father and mother-in-law any mark of filial\nattention, yea so much as for one single day and to you, my dear aunt,\nwith all this affection of yours for me, I have every wish to be dutiful\nto the utmost degree, but, in my present state, I’m really not equal to\nit; my own idea is, that it isn’t likely that I shall last through this\nyear.”",
        "Pao-yü kept, while (she spoke,) his eyes fixed intently upon a picture\non the opposite side, representing some begonias drooping in the spring\ntime, and upon a pair of scrolls, with this inscription written by Ch’in\nTai-hsü:\r\r",
        "  A gentle chill doth circumscribe the dreaming man because the spring\n      is cold!\n  The fragrant whiff which wafts itself into man’s nose, is the perfume\n      of wine!",
        "And he could not help recalling to mind his experiences at the time when\nhe had fallen asleep in this apartment, and had, in his dream, visited\nthe confines of the Great Void. He was just plunged in a state of\nabstraction, when he heard Mrs. Ch’in give utterance to these\nsentiments, which pierced his heart as if they were ten thousand arrows,\n(with the result that) tears unwittingly trickled from his eyes.",
        "Lady Feng perceiving him in tears felt it extremely painful within\nherself to bear the sight; but she was on pins and needles lest the\npatient should detect their frame of mind, and feel, instead (of\nbenefit), still more sore at heart, which would not, after all, be quite\nthe purpose of her visit; which was to afford her distraction and\nconsolation. “Pao-yü,” she therefore exclaimed, “you are like an old\nwoman! Ill, as she is, simply makes her speak in this wise, and how ever\ncould things come to such a pass! Besides, she is young in years, so\nthat after a short indisposition, her illness will get all right!\"\n\"Don’t,” she said as she turned towards Mrs. Ch’in, “give way to silly\nthoughts and idle ideas! for by so doing won’t you yourself be\naggravating your ailment?”",
        "“All that her sickness in fact needs,” observed Chia Jung, “is, that she\nshould be able to take something to eat, and then there will be nothing\nto fear.”",
        "“Brother Pao,” urged lady Feng, “your mother told you to go over, as\nsoon as you could, so that don’t stay here, and go on in the way you’re\ndoing, for you after all incite this lady also to feel uneasy at heart.\nBesides, your mother over there is solicitous on your account.” “You had\nbetter go ahead with your uncle Pao,” she consequently continued,\naddressing herself to Chia Jung, “while I sit here a little longer.”",
        "When Chia Jung heard this remark, he promptly crossed over with Pao-yü\ninto the garden of Concentrated Fragrance, while lady Feng went on both\nto cheer her up for a time, and to impart to her, in an undertone, a\ngood deal of confidential advice.",
        "Mrs. Yu had despatched servants, on two or three occasions, to hurry\nlady Feng, before she said to Mrs. Ch’in: “Do all you can to take good\ncare of yourself, and I’ll come and see you again. You’re bound to get\nover this illness; and now, in fact, that you’ve come across that\nrenowned doctor, you have really nothing more to fear.”",
        "“He might,” observed Mrs. Ch’in as she smiled, “even be a supernatural\nbeing and succeed in healing my disease, but he won’t be able to remedy\nmy destiny; for, my dear aunt, I feel sure that with this complaint of\nmine, I can do no more than drag on from day to day.”",
        "“If you encourage such ideas,” remonstrated lady Feng, “how can this\nillness ever get all right? What you absolutely need is to cast away all\nthese notions, and then you’ll improve. I hear moreover that the doctor\nasserts that if no cure be effected, the fear is of a change for the\nworse in spring, and not till then. Did you and I moreover belong to a\nfamily that hadn’t the means to afford any ginseng, it would be\ndifficult to say how we could manage to get it; but were your father and\nmother-in-law to hear that it’s good for your recovery, why not to speak\nof two mace of ginseng a day, but even two catties will be also within\ntheir means! So mind you do take every care of your health! I’m now off\non my way into the garden.”",
        "“Excuse me, my dear aunt,” added Mrs. Ch’in, “that I can’t go with you;\nbut when you have nothing to do, I entreat you do come over and see me!\nand you and I can sit and have a long chat.”",
        "After lady Feng had heard these words, her eyes unwillingly got quite\nred again. “When I’m at leisure I shall, of course,” she rejoined, “come\noften to see you;” and forthwith leading off the matrons and married\nwomen, who had come over with her, as well as the women and matrons of\nthe Ning mansion, she passed through the inner part of the house, and\nentered, by a circuitous way, the side gate of the park, when she\nperceived: yellow flowers covering the ground; white willows flanking\nthe slopes; diminutive bridges spanning streams, resembling the Jo Yeh;\nzigzag pathways (looking as if) they led to the steps of Heaven; limpid\nsprings dripping from among the rocks; flowers hanging from hedges\nemitting their fragrance, as they were flapped by the winds; red leaves\non the tree tops swaying to and fro; groves picture-like, half stripped\nof foliage; the western breeze coming with sudden gusts, and the wail of\nthe oriole still audible; the warm sun shining with genial rays, and the\ncicada also adding its chirp: structures, visible to the gaze at a\ndistance in the South-east, soaring high on various sites and resting\nagainst the hills; three halls, visible near by on the North-west,\nstretching in one connected line, on the bank of the stream; strains of\nmusic filling the pavilion, imbued with an unwonted subtle charm; and\nmaidens in fine attire penetrating the groves, lending an additional\nspell to the scene.",
        "Lady Feng, while engaged in contemplating the beauties of the spot,\nadvanced onwards step by step. She was plunged in a state of ecstasy,\nwhen suddenly, from the rear of the artificial rockery, egressed a\nperson, who approached her and facing her said, “My respects to you,\nsister-in-law.”",
        "Lady Feng was so startled by this unexpected appearance that she drew\nback. “Isn’t this Mr. Jui?” she ventured.",
        "“What! sister-in-law,” exclaimed Chia Jui, “don’t you recognise even\nme?”",
        "“It isn’t that I didn’t recognise you,” explained lady Feng, “but at the\nsudden sight of you, I couldn’t conceive that it would possibly be you,\nsir, in this place!”",
        "“This was in fact bound to be,” replied Chia Jui; “for there’s some\nsubtle sympathy between me and you, sister-in-law. Here I just\nstealthily leave the entertainment, in order to revel for a while in\nthis solitary place when, against every expectation, I come across you,\nsister-in-law; and isn’t this a subtle sympathy?”",
        "As he spoke, he kept his gaze fixed on lady Feng, who being an\nintelligent person, could not but arrive, at the sight of his manner, at\nthe whole truth in her surmises. “It isn’t to be wondered at,” she\nconsequently observed, as she smiled hypocritically, “that your eldest\nbrother should make frequent allusion to your qualities! for after\nseeing you on this occasion, and hearing you utter these few remarks, I\nhave readily discovered what an intelligent and genial person you are! I\nam just now on my way to join the ladies on the other side, and have no\nleisure to converse with you; but wait until I’ve nothing to attend to,\nwhen we can meet again.”",
        "“I meant to have gone over to your place and paid my respects to you,\nsister-in-law,” pleaded Chia Jui, “but I was afraid lest a person of\ntender years like yourself mightn’t lightly receive any visitors!”",
        "Lady Feng gave another sardonic smile. “Relatives,” she continued, “of\none family, as we are, what need is there to say anything of tender\nyears?”",
        "After Chia Jui had heard these words, he felt his heart swell within him\nwith such secret joy that he was urged to reflect: “I have at length\nto-day, when least I expected it, obtained this remarkable encounter\nwith her!”",
        "But as the display of his passion became still more repulsive, lady Feng\nurged him to go. “Be off at once,” she remarked, “and join the\nentertainment; for mind, if they find you out, they will mulct you in so\nmany glasses of wine!”",
        "By the time this suggestion had reached Chia Jui’s ears, half of his\nbody had become stiff like a log of wood; and as he betook himself away,\nwith lothful step, he turned his head round to cast glances at her. Lady\nFeng purposely slackened her pace; and when she perceived that he had\ngone a certain distance, she gave way to reflection. “This is indeed,\"\nshe thought, “knowing a person, as far as face goes, and not as heart!\nCan there be another such a beast as he! If he really continues to\nbehave in this manner, I shall soon enough compass his death, with my\nown hands, and he’ll then know what stuff I’m made of.”",
        "Lady Feng, at this juncture moved onward, and after turning round a\nchain of hillocks, she caught sight of two or three matrons coming along\nwith all speed. As soon as they espied lady Feng they put on a smile.\n\"Our mistress,” they said, “perceiving that your ladyship was not\nforthcoming, has been in a great state of anxiety, and bade your\nservants come again to request you to come over.",
        "“Is your mistress,” observed lady Feng, “so like a quick-footed demon?”",
        "While lady Feng advanced leisurely, she inquired, “How many plays have\nbeen recited?” to which question one of the matrons replied, “They have\ngone through eight or nine.” But while engaged in conversation, they had\nalready reached the back door of the Tower of Celestial Fragrance, where\nshe caught sight of Pao-yü playing with a company of waiting-maids and\npages. “Brother Pao,” lady Feng exclaimed, “don’t be up to too much\nmischief!” “The ladies are all sitting upstairs,” interposed one of the\nmaids. “Please, my lady, this is the way up.”",
        "At these words lady Feng slackened her pace, raised her dress, and\nwalked up the stairs, where Mrs. Yu was already at the top of the\nlanding waiting for her.",
        "“You two,” remarked Mrs. Yu, smiling, “are so friendly, that having met\nyou couldn’t possibly tear yourself away to come. You had better\nto-morrow move over there and take up your quarters with her and have\ndone; but sit down and let me, first of all, present you a glass of\nwine.”",
        "Lady Feng speedily drew near mesdames Hsing and Wang, and begged\npermission to take a seat; while Mrs. Yu brought the programme, and\npressed lady Feng to mark some plays.",
        "“The senior ladies occupy the seats of honour,” remonstrated lady Feng,\n\"and how can I presume to choose?”",
        "“We, and our relative by marriage, have selected several plays,\"\nexplained mesdames Hsing and Wang, “and it’s for you now to choose some\ngood ones for us to listen to.”",
        "Standing up, lady Feng signified her obedience; and taking over the\nprogramme, and perusing it from top to bottom, she marked off one\nentitled, the “Return of the Spirit,” and another called “Thrumming and\nSinging;” after which she handed back the programme, observing, “When\nthey have done with the ’Ennoblement of two Officers,’ which they are\nsinging just at present, it will be time enough to sing these two.”",
        "“Of course it will,” retorted madame Wang, “but they should get it over\nas soon as they can, so as to allow your elder Brother and your\nSister-in-law to have rest; besides, their hearts are not at ease.”",
        "“You senior ladies don’t come often,” expostulated Mrs. Yu, “and you and\nI will derive more enjoyment were we to stay a little longer; it’s as\nyet early in the day!”",
        "Lady Feng stood up and looked downstairs. “Where have all the gentlemen\ngone to?” she inquired.",
        "“The gentlemen have just gone over to the Pavilion of Plenteous\nEffulgence,” replied a matron, who stood by; “they have taken along with\nthem ten musicians and gone in there to drink their wine.”",
        "“It wasn’t convenient for them,” remarked lady Feng, “to be over here;\nbut who knows what they have again gone to do behind our backs?”",
        "“Could every one,” interposed Mrs. Yu, “resemble you, a person of such\npropriety!”",
        "While they indulged in chatting and laughing, the plays they had chosen\nwere all finished; whereupon the tables were cleared of the wines, and\nthe repast was served. The meal over, the whole company adjourned into\nthe garden, and came and sat in the drawing-room. After tea, they at\nlength gave orders to get ready the carriages, and they took their leave\nof Mrs. Yu’s mother. Mrs. Yu, attended by all the secondary wives,\nservants, and married women, escorted them out, while Chia Chen, along\nwith the whole bevy of young men, stood by the vehicles, waiting in a\ngroup for their arrival.",
        "After saluting mesdames Hsing and Wang, “Aunts,” they said, “you must\ncome over again to-morrow for a stroll.”",
        "“We must be excused,” observed madame Wang, “we’ve sat here the whole\nday to-day, and are, after all, feeling quite tired; besides, we shall\nneed to have some rest to-morrow.”",
        "Both of them thereupon got into their carriages and took their\ndeparture, while Chia Jui still kept a fixed gaze upon lady Feng; and it\nwas after Chia Chen had gone in that Li Kuei led round the horse, and\nthat Pao-yü mounted and went off, following in the track of mesdames\nHsing and Wang.",
        "Chia Chen and the whole number of brothers and nephews belonging to the\nfamily had, during this interval, partaken of their meal, and the whole\nparty at length broke up. But in like manner, all the inmates of the\nclan and the guests spent on the morrow another festive day, but we need\nnot advert to it with any minuteness.",
        "After this occasion, lady Feng came in person and paid frequent visits\nto Mrs. Ch’in; but as there were some days on which her ailment was\nconsiderably better, and others on which it was considerably worse, Chia\nChen, Mrs. Yu, and Chia Jung were in an awful state of anxiety.",
        "Chia Jui, it must moreover be noticed, came over, on several instances,\non a visit to the Jung mansion; but it invariably happened that he found\nthat lady Feng had gone over to the Ning mansion.",
        "This was just the thirtieth of the eleventh moon, the day on which the\nwinter solstice fell; and the few days preceding that season, dowager\nlady Chia, madame Wang and lady Feng did not let one day go by without\nsending some one to inquire about Mrs. Ch’in; and as the servants, on\ntheir return, repeatedly reported that, during the last few days,\nneither had her ailment aggravated, nor had it undergone any marked\nimprovement, madame Wang explained to dowager lady Chia, that as a\ncomplaint of this nature had reached this kind of season without getting\nany worse, there was some hope of recovery.",
        "“Of course there is!” observed the old lady; “what a dear child she is!\nshould anything happen to her, won’t it be enough to make people die\nfrom grief!” and as she spake she felt for a time quite sore at heart.\n\"You and she,” continuing, she said to lady Feng, “have been friends for\never so long; to-morrow is the glorious first (and you can’t go), but\nafter to-morrow you should pay her a visit and minutely scrutinise her\nappearance: and should you find her any better, come and tell me on your\nreturn! Whatever things that dear child has all along a fancy for, do\nsend her round a few even as often as you can by some one or other!”",
        "Lady Feng assented to each of her recommendations; and when the second\narrived, she came, after breakfast, to the Ning mansion to see how Mrs.\nCh’in was getting on; and though she found her none the worse, the flesh\nall over her face and person had however become emaciated and parched\nup. She readily sat with Mrs. Ch’in for a long while, and after they had\nchatted on one thing and another, she again reiterated the assurances\nthat this illness involved no danger, and distracted her for ever so\nlong.",
        "“Whether I get well or not,” observed Mrs. Ch’in, “we’ll know in spring;\nnow winter is just over, and I’m anyhow no worse, so that possibly I may\nget all right; and yet there’s no saying; but, my dear sister-in-law, do\npress our old lady to compose her mind! yesterday, her ladyship sent me\nsome potato dumplings, with minced dates in them, and though I had two,\nthey seem after all to be very easily digested!”",
        "“I’ll send you round some more to-morrow,” lady Feng suggested; “I’m now\ngoing to look up your mother-in-law, and will then hurry back to give my\nreport to our dowager lady.”",
        "“Please, sister-in-law,” Mrs. Ch’in said, “present my best respects to\nher venerable ladyship, as well as to madame Wang.”",
        "Lady Feng signified that she would comply with her wishes, and,\nforthwith leaving the apartment, she came over and sat in Mrs. Yu’s\nsuite of rooms.",
        "“How do you, who don’t see our son’s wife very often, happen to find\nher?” inquired Mrs. Yu.\r",
        "Lady Feng drooped her head for some time. “There’s no help,” she\nventured, “for this illness! but you should likewise make every\nsubsequent preparation, for it would also be well if you could scour it\naway.”",
        "“I’ve done so much as to secretly give orders,” replied Mrs. Yu, “to get\nthings ready; but for that thing (the coffin), there’s no good timber to\nbe found, so that it will have to be looked after by and by.”",
        "Lady Feng swallowed hastily a cup of tea, and after a short chat, “I\nmust be hurrying back,” she remarked, “to deliver my message to our\ndowager lady!”",
        "“You should,” urged Mrs. Yu, “be sparse in what you tell her lady ship\nso as not to frighten an old person like her!”",
        "“I know well enough what to say,” replied lady Feng.",
        "Without any further delay, lady Feng then sped back. On her arrival at\nhome she looked up the old lady. “Brother Jung’s wife,” she explained,\n\"presents her compliments, and pays obeisance to your venerable\nladyship; she says that she’s much better, and entreats you, her worthy\nsenior, to set your mind at ease! That as soon as she’s a little better\nshe will come and prostrate herself before your ladyship.”",
        "“How do you find her?” inquired dowager lady Chia.",
        "“For the present there’s nothing to fear,” continued lady Feng; “for her\nmien is still good.”",
        "After the old lady had heard these words, she was plunged for a long\nwhile in deep reflection; and as she turned towards lady Feng, “Go and\ndivest yourself of your toilette,” she said, “and have some rest.”",
        "Lady Feng in consequence signified her obedience, and walked away,\nreturning home after paying madame Wang a visit. P’ing Erh helped lady\nFeng to put on the house costume, which she had warmed by the fire, and\nlady Feng eventually took a seat and asked “whether there was anything\ndoing at home?”",
        "P’ing Erh then brought the tea, and after going over to hand the cup:\n\"There’s nothing doing,” she replied; “as regards the interest on the\nthree hundred taels, Wang Erh’s wife has brought it in, and I’ve put it\naway. Besides this, Mr. Jui sent round to inquire if your ladyship was\nat home or not, as he meant to come and pay his respects and to have a\nchat.”",
        "“Heng!” exclaimed lady Feng at these words. “Why should this beast\ncompass his own death? we’ll see when he comes what is to be done.”",
        "“Why is this Mr. Jui so bent upon coming?’ P’ing Erh having inquired,\nlady Feng readily gave her an account of how she had met him in the\ncourse of the ninth moon in the Ning mansion, and of what had been said\nby him.",
        "“What a mangy frog to be bent upon eating the flesh of a heavenly\ngoose!” ejaculated P’ing Erh. “A stupid and disorderly fellow with no\nconception of relationship, to harbour such a thought! but we’ll make\nhim find an unnatural death!”",
        "“Wait till he comes,” added lady Feng, “when I feel certain I shall find\nsome way.”",
        "What happened, however, when Chia Jui came has not, as yet, been\nascertained, but listen, reader, to the explanation given in the next\nchapter.",
        "  Wang Hsi-feng maliciously lays a trap for Chia Jui, under pretence\n      that his affection is reciprocated.\n  Chia T’ien-hsiang gazes at the face of the mirror of Voluptuousness.",
        "Lady Feng, it must be noticed in continuation of our narrative, was just\nengaged in talking with P’ing Erh, when they heard some one announce\nthat Mr. Jui had come. Lady Feng gave orders that he should be invited\nto step in, and Chia Jui perceiving that he had been asked to walk in\nwas at heart elated at the prospect of seeing her.",
        "With a face beaming with smiles, Lady Feng inquired again and again how\nhe was; and, with simulated tenderness she further pressed him to take a\nseat and urged him to have a cup of tea.",
        "Chia Jui noticed how still more voluptuous lady Feng looked in her\npresent costume, and, as his eyes burnt with love, “How is it,” he\ninquired, “that my elder brother Secundus is not yet back?”",
        "“What the reason is I cannot tell,” lady Feng said by way of reply.",
        "“May it not be,” Chia Jui smilingly insinuated, “that some fair damsel\nhas got hold of him on the way, and that he cannot brook to tear himself\nfrom her to come home?”",
        "“That makes it plain that there are those among men who fall in love\nwith any girl they cast their eyes on,” hinted lady Feng.",
        "“Your remarks are, sister-in-law, incorrect, for I’m none of this kind!\"\nChia Jui explained smirkingly.",
        "“How many like you can there be!” rejoined lady Feng with a sarcastic\nsmile; “in ten, not one even could be picked out!”",
        "When Chia Jui heard these words, he felt in such high glee that he\nrubbed his ears and smoothed his cheeks. “My sister-in-law,” he\ncontinued, “you must of course be extremely lonely day after day.”",
        "“Indeed I am,” observed lady Feng, “and I only wish some one would come\nand have a chat with me to break my dull monotony.”",
        "“I daily have ample leisure,” Chia Jui ventured with a simper, “and\nwouldn’t it be well if I came every day to dispel your dulness,\nsister-in-law?”",
        "“You are simply fooling me,” exclaimed lady Feng laughing. “It isn’t\nlikely you would wish to come over here to me?”",
        "“If in your presence, sister-in-law, I utter a single word of falsehood,\nmay the thunder from heaven blast me!” protested Chia Jui. “It’s only\nbecause I had all along heard people say that you were a dreadful\nperson, and that you cannot condone even the slightest shortcoming\ncommitted in your presence, that I was induced to keep back by fear; but\nafter seeing you, on this occasion, so chatty, so full of fun and most\nconsiderate to others, how can I not come? were it to be the cause of my\ndeath, I would be even willing to come!”",
        "“You’re really a clever person,” lady Feng observed sarcastically. “And\noh so much superior to both Chia Jung and his brother! Handsome as their\npresence was to look at, I imagined their minds to be full of\nintelligence, but who would have thought that they would, after all, be\na couple of stupid worms, without the least notion of human affection!”",
        "The words which Chia Jui heard, fell in so much the more with his own\nsentiments, that he could not restrain himself from again pressing\nforward nearer to her; and as with eyes strained to give intentness to\nhis view, he gazed at lady Feng’s purse: “What rings have you got on?\"\nhe went on to ask.",
        "“You should be a little more deferential,” remonstrated lady Feng in a\nlow tone of voice, “so as not to let the waiting-maids detect us.”",
        "Chia Jui withdrew backward with as much alacrity as if he had received\nan Imperial decree or a mandate from Buddha.",
        "“You ought to be going!” lady Feng suggested, as she gave him a smile.",
        "“Do let me stay a while longer,” entreated Chia Jui, “you are indeed\nruthless, my sister-in-law.”",
        "But with gentle voice did lady Feng again expostulate. “In broad\ndaylight,” she said, “with people coming and going, it is not really\nconvenient that you should abide in here; so you had better go, and when\nit’s dark and the watch is set, you can come over, and quietly wait for\nme in the corridor on the Eastern side!”",
        "At these words, Chia Jui felt as if he had received some jewel or\nprecious thing. “Don’t make fun of me!” he remarked with vehemence. “The\nonly thing is that crowds of people are ever passing from there, and how\nwill it be possible for me to evade detection?”",
        "“Set your mind at ease!” lady Feng advised; “I shall dismiss on leave\nall the youths on duty at night; and when the doors, on both sides, are\nclosed, there will be no one else to come in!”",
        "Chia Jui was delighted beyond measure by the assurance, and with\nimpetuous haste, he took his leave and went off; convinced at heart of\nthe gratification of his wishes. He continued, up to the time of dusk, a\nprey to keen expectation; and, when indeed darkness fell, he felt his\nway into the Jung mansion, availing himself of the moment, when the\ndoors were being closed, to slip into the corridor, where everything was\nactually pitch dark, and not a soul to be seen going backwards or\nforwards.",
        "The door leading over to dowager lady Chia’s apartments had already been\nput under key, and there was but one gate, the one on the East, which\nhad not as yet been locked. Chia Jui lent his ear, and listened for ever\nso long, but he saw no one appear. Suddenly, however, was heard a sound\nlike “lo teng,” and the east gate was also bolted; but though Chia Jui\nwas in a great state of impatience, he none the less did not venture to\nutter a sound. All that necessity compelled him to do was to issue, with\nquiet steps, from his corner, and to try the gates by pushing; but they\nwere closed as firmly as if they had been made fast with iron bolts; and\nmuch though he may, at this juncture, have wished to find his way out,\nescape was, in fact, out of the question; on the south and north was one\ncontinuous dead wall, which, even had he wished to scale, there was\nnothing which he could clutch and pull himself up by.",
        "This room, besides, was one the interior (of which was exposed) to the\nwind, which entered through (the fissure) of the door; and was perfectly\nempty and bare; and the weather being, at this time, that of December,\nand the night too very long, the northerly wind, with its biting gusts,\nwas sufficient to penetrate the flesh and to cleave the bones, so that\nthe whole night long he had a narrow escape from being frozen to death;\nand he was yearning, with intolerable anxiety for the break of day, when\nhe espied an old matron go first and open the door on the East side, and\nthen come in and knock at the western gate.",
        "Chia Jui seeing that she had turned her face away, bolted out, like a\nstreak of smoke, as he hugged his shoulders with his hands (from intense\ncold.) As luck would have it, the hour was as yet early, so that the\ninmates of the house had not all got out of bed; and making his escape\nfrom the postern door, he straightaway betook himself home, running back\nthe whole way.",
        "Chia Jui’s parents had, it must be explained, departed life at an early\nperiod, and he had no one else, besides his grandfather Tai-ju, to take\r\ncharge of his support and education. This Tai-ju had, all along,\nexercised a very strict control, and would not allow Chia Jui to even\nmake one step too many, in the apprehension that he might gad about out\nof doors drinking and gambling, to the neglect of his studies.",
        "Seeing, on this unexpected occasion, that he had not come home the whole\nnight, he simply felt positive, in his own mind, that he was certain to\nhave run about, if not drinking, at least gambling, and dissipating in\nhouses of the demi-monde up to the small hours; but he never even gave\nso much as a thought to the possibility of a public scandal, as that in\nwhich he was involved. The consequence was that during the whole length\nof the night he boiled with wrath.",
        "Chia Jui himself, on the other hand, was (in such a state of\ntrepidation) that he could wipe the perspiration (off his face) by\nhandfuls; and he felt constrained on his return home, to have recourse\nto deceitful excuses, simply explaining that he had been at his eldest\nmaternal uncle’s house, and that when it got dark, they kept him to\nspend the night there.",
        "“Hitherto,” remonstrated Tai-ju, “when about to go out of doors, you\nnever ventured to go, on your own hook, without first telling me about\nit, and how is it that yesterday you surreptitiously left the house? for\nthis offence alone you deserve a beating, and how much more for the lie\nimposed upon me.”",
        "Into such a violent fit of anger did he consequently fly that laying\nhands on him, he pulled him over and administered to him thirty or forty\nblows with a cane. Nor would he allow him to have anything to eat, but\nbade him remain on his knees in the court conning essays; impressing on\nhis mind that he would not let him off, before he had made up for the\nlast ten days’ lessons.",
        "Chia Jui had in the first instance, frozen the whole night, and, in the\nnext place, came in for a flogging. With a stomach, besides, gnawed by\nthe pangs of hunger, he had to kneel in a place exposed to drafts\nreading the while literary compositions, so that the hardships he had to\nendure were of manifold kinds.",
        "Chia Jui’s infamous intentions had at this junction undergone no change;\nbut far from his thoughts being even then any idea that lady Feng was\nhumbugging him, he seized, after the lapse of a couple of days, the\nfirst leisure moments to come again in search of that lady.",
        "Lady Feng pretended to bear him a grudge for his breach of faith, and\nChia Jui was so distressed that he tried by vows and oaths (to establish\nhis innocence.) Lady Feng perceiving that he had, of his own accord,\nfallen into the meshes of the net laid for him, could not but devise\nanother plot to give him a lesson and make him know what was right and\nmend his ways.",
        "With this purpose, she gave him another assignation. “Don’t go over\nthere,” she said, “to-night, but wait for me in the empty rooms giving\non to a small passage at the back of these apartments of mine. But\nwhatever you do, mind don’t be reckless.”",
        "“Are you in real earnest?” Chia Jui inquired.",
        "“Why, who wants to play with you?” replied lady Feng; “if you don’t\nbelieve what I say, well then don’t come!”",
        "“I’ll come, I’ll come, yea I’ll come, were I even to die!” protested\nChia Jui.",
        "“You should first at this very moment get away!” lady Feng having\nsuggested, Chia Jui, who felt sanguine that when evening came, success\nwould for a certainty crown his visit, took at once his departure in\nanticipation (of his pleasure.)",
        "During this interval lady Feng hastily set to work to dispose of her\nresources, and to add to her stratagems, and she laid a trap for her\nvictim; while Chia Jui, on the other hand, was until the shades of\ndarkness fell, a prey to incessant expectation.",
        "As luck would have it a relative of his happened to likewise come on\nthat very night to their house and to only leave after he had dinner\nwith them, and at an hour of the day when the lamps had already been\nlit; but he had still to wait until his grandfather had retired to rest\nbefore he could, at length with precipitate step, betake himself into\nthe Jung mansion.",
        "Straightway he came into the rooms in the narrow passage, and waited\nwith as much trepidation as if he had been an ant in a hot pan. He\nhowever waited and waited, but he saw no one arrive; he listened but not\neven the sound of a voice reached his ear. His heart was full of intense\nfear, and he could not restrain giving way to surmises and suspicion.\n\"May it not be,” he thought, “that she is not coming again; and that I\nmay have once more to freeze for another whole night?”",
        "While indulging in these erratic reflections, he discerned some one\ncoming, looking like a black apparition, who Chia Jui readily concluded,\nin his mind, must be lady Feng; so that, unmindful of distinguishing\nblack from white, he as soon as that person arrived in front of him,\nspeedily clasped her in his embrace, like a ravenous tiger pouncing upon\nits prey, or a cat clawing a rat, and cried: “My darling sister, you\nhave made me wait till I’m ready to die.”",
        "As he uttered these words, he dragged the comer, in his arms, on to the\ncouch in the room; and while indulging in kisses and protestations of\nwarm love, he began to cry out at random epithets of endearment.",
        "Not a sound, however, came from the lips of the other person; and Chia\nJui had in the fulness of his passion, exceeded the bounds of timid love\nand was in the act of becoming still more affectionate in his\nprotestations, when a sudden flash of a light struck his eye, by the\nrays of which he espied Chia Se with a candle in hand, casting the light\nround the place, “Who’s in this room?” he exclaimed.",
        "“Uncle Jui,” he heard some one on the couch explain, laughing, “was\ntrying to take liberties with me!”",
        "Chia Jui at one glance became aware that it was no other than Chia Jung;\nand a sense of shame at once so overpowered him that he could find\nnowhere to hide himself; nor did he know how best to extricate himself\nfrom the dilemma. Turning himself round, he made an attempt to make good\r\nhis escape, when Chia Se with one grip clutched him in his hold.",
        "“Don’t run away,” he said; “sister-in-law Lien has already reported your\nconduct to madame Wang; and explained that you had tried to make her\ncarry on an improper flirtation with you; that she had temporised by\nhaving recourse to a scheme to escape your importunities, and that she\nhad imposed upon you in such a way as to make you wait for her in this\nplace. Our lady was so terribly incensed, that she well-nigh succumbed;\nand hence it is that she bade me come and catch you! Be quick now and\nfollow me, and let us go and see her.”",
        "After Chia Jui had heard these words, his very soul could not be\ncontained within his body.",
        "“My dear nephew,” he entreated, “do tell her that it wasn’t I; and I’ll\nshow you my gratitude to-morrow in a substantial manner.”",
        "“Letting you off,” rejoined Chia Se, “is no difficult thing; but how\nmuch, I wonder, are you likely to give? Besides, what you now utter with\nyour lips, there will be no proof to establish; so you had better write\na promissory note.”",
        "“How could I put what happened in black and white on paper?” observed\nChia Jui.",
        "“There’s no difficulty about that either!” replied Chia Se; “just write\nan account of a debt due, for losses in gambling, to some one outside;\nfor payment of which you had to raise funds, by a loan of a stated\nnumber of taels, from the head of the house; and that will be all that\nis required.”",
        "“This is, in fact, easy enough!” Chia Jui having added by way of answer;\nChia Se turned round and left the room; and returning with paper and\npencils, which had been got ready beforehand for the purpose, he bade\nChia Jui write. The two of them (Chia Jung and Chia Se) tried, the one\nto do a good turn, and the other to be perverse in his insistence; but\n(Chia Jui) put down no more than fifty taels, and appended his\nsignature.",
        "Chia Se pocketed the note, and endeavoured subsequently to induce Chia\nJung to come away; but Chia Jung was, at the outset, obdurate and\nunwilling to give in, and kept on repeating; “To-morrow, I’ll tell the\nmembers of our clan to look into your nice conduct!”",
        "These words plunged Chia Jui in such a state of dismay, that he even\nwent so far as to knock his head on the ground; but, as Chia Se was\ntrying to get unfair advantage of him though he had at first done him a\ngood turn, he had to write another promissory note for fifty taels,\nbefore the matter was dropped.",
        "Taking up again the thread of the conversation, Chia Se remarked, “Now\nwhen I let you go, I’m quite ready to bear the blame! But the gate at\nour old lady’s over there is already bolted, and Mr. Chia Cheng is just\nnow engaged in the Hall, looking at the things which have arrived from\nNanking, so that it would certainly be difficult for you to pass through\nthat way. The only safe course at present is by the back gate; but if\nyou do go by there, and perchance meet any one, even I will be in for a\nmess; so you might as well wait until I go first and have a peep, when\nI’ll come and fetch you! You couldn’t anyhow conceal yourself in this\nroom; for in a short time they’ll be coming to stow the things away, and\nyou had better let me find a safe place for you.”",
        "These words ended, he took hold of Chia Jui, and, extinguishing again\nthe lantern, he brought him out into the court, feeling his way up to\nthe bottom of the steps of the large terrace. “It’s safe enough in this\nnest,” he observed, “but just squat down quietly and don’t utter a\nsound; wait until I come back before you venture out.”",
        "Having concluded this remark, the two of them (Chia Se and Chia Jung)\nwalked away; while Chia Jui was, all this time, out of his senses, and\nfelt constrained to remain squatting at the bottom of the terrace\nstairs. He was about to consider what course was open for him to adopt,\nwhen he heard a noise just over his head; and, with a splash, the\ncontents of a bucket, consisting entirely of filthy water, was emptied\nstraight down over him from above, drenching, as luck would have it, his\nwhole person and head.",
        "Chia Jui could not suppress an exclamation. “Ai ya!” he cried, but he\nhastily stopped his mouth with his hands, and did not venture to give\nvent to another sound. His whole head and face were a mass of filth, and\nhis body felt icy cold. But as he shivered and shook, he espied Chia Se\ncome running. “Get off,” he shouted, “with all speed! off with you at\nonce!”",
        "As soon as Chia Jui returned to life again, he bolted with hasty\nstrides, out of the back gate, and ran the whole way home. The night had\nalready reached the third watch, so that he had to knock at the door for\nit to be opened.",
        "“What’s the matter?” inquired the servants, when they saw him in this\nsorry plight; (an inquiry) which placed him in the necessity of making\nsome false excuse. “The night was dark,” he explained, “and my foot\nslipped and I fell into a gutter.”",
        "Saying this, he betook himself speedily to his own apartment; and it was\nonly after he had changed his clothes and performed his ablutions, that\nhe began to realise that lady Feng had made a fool of him. He\nconsequently gave way to a fit of wrath; but upon recalling to mind the\ncharms of lady Feng’s face, he felt again extremely aggrieved that he\ncould not there and then clasp her in his embrace, and as he indulged in\nthese wild thoughts and fanciful ideas, he could not the whole night\nlong close his eyes.",
        "From this time forward his mind was, it is true, still with lady Feng,\nbut he did not have the courage to put his foot into the Jung mansion;\nand with Chia Jung and Chia Se both coming time and again to dun him for\nthe money, he was likewise full of fears lest his grandfather should\ncome to know everything.",
        "His passion for lady Feng was, in fact, already a burden hard to bear,\nand when, moreover, the troubles of debts were superadded to his tasks,\nwhich were also during the whole day arduous, he, a young man of about\ntwenty, as yet unmarried, and a prey to constant cravings for lady Feng,\nwhich were difficult to gratify, could not avoid giving way, to a great\nextent, to such evil habits as exhausted his energies. His lot had, what\nis more, been on two occasions to be frozen, angered and to endure much\nhardship, so that with the attacks received time and again from all\nsides, he unconsciously soon contracted an organic disease. In his heart\ninflammation set in; his mouth lost the sense of taste; his feet got as\nsoft as cotton from weakness; his eyes stung, as if there were vinegar\nin them. At night, he burnt with fever. During the day, he was\nrepeatedly under the effects of lassitude. Perspiration was profuse,\nwhile with his expectorations of phlegm, he brought up blood. The whole\nnumber of these several ailments came upon him, before the expiry of a\nyear, (with the result that) in course of time, he had not the strength\nto bear himself up. Of a sudden, he would fall down, and with his eyes,\nalbeit closed, his spirit would be still plunged in confused dreams,\nwhile his mouth would be full of nonsense and he would be subject to\nstrange starts.",
        "Every kind of doctor was asked to come in, and every treatment had\nrecourse to; and, though of such medicines as cinnamon, aconitum seeds,\nturtle shell, ophiopogon, Yü-chü herb, and the like, he took several\ntens of catties, he nevertheless experienced no change for the better;\nso that by the time the twelfth moon drew once again to an end, and\nspring returned, this illness had become still more serious.",
        "Tai-ju was very much concerned, and invited doctors from all parts to\nattend to him, but none of them could do him any good. And as later on,\nhe had to take nothing else but decoctions of pure ginseng, Tai-ju could\nnot of course afford it. Having no other help but to come over to the\nJung mansion, and make requisition for some, Madame Wang asked lady Feng\nto weigh two taels of it and give it to him. “The other day,” rejoined\nlady Feng, “not long ago, when we concocted some medicine for our\ndowager lady, you told us, madame, to keep the pieces that were whole,\r\nto present to the spouse of General Yang to make physic with, and as it\nhappens it was only yesterday that I sent some one round with them.”",
        "“If there’s none over here in our place,” suggested madame Wang, “just\nsend a servant to your mother-in-law’s, on the other side, to inquire\nwhether they have any. Or it may possibly be that your elder\nbrother-in-law Chen, over there, might have a little. If so, put all you\nget together, and give it to them; and when he shall have taken it, and\ngot well and you shall have saved the life of a human being, it will\nreally be to the benefit of you all.”",
        "Lady Feng acquiesced; but without directing a single person to institute\nany search, she simply took some refuse twigs, and making up a few mace,\nshe despatched them with the meagre message that they had been sent by\nmadame Wang, and that there was, in fact, no more; subsequently\nreporting to madame Wang that she had asked for and obtained all there\nwas and that she had collected as much as two taels, and forwarded it to\nthem.",
        "Chia Jui was, meanwhile, very anxious to recover his health, so that\nthere was no medicine that he would not take, but the outlay of money\nwas of no avail, for he derived no benefit.",
        "On a certain day and at an unexpected moment, a lame Taoist priest came\nto beg for alms, and he averred that he had the special gift of healing\ndiseases arising from grievances received, and as Chia Jui happened,\nfrom inside, to hear what he said, he forthwith shouted out: “Go at\nonce, and bid that divine come in and save my life!” while he\nreverentially knocked his head on the pillow.",
        "The whole bevy of servants felt constrained to usher the Taoist in; and\nChia Jui, taking hold of him with a dash, “My Buddha!” he repeatedly\ncried out, “save my life!”",
        "The Taoist heaved a sigh. “This ailment of yours,” he remarked, “is not\none that could be healed with any medicine; I have a precious thing here\nwhich I’ll give you, and if you gaze at it every day, your life can be\nsaved!”",
        "When he had done talking, he produced from his pouch a looking-glass\nwhich could reflect a person’s face on the front and back as well. On\nthe upper part of the back were engraved the four characters: “Precious\nMirror of Voluptuousness.” Handing it over to Chia Jui: “This object,\"\nhe proceeded, “emanates from the primordial confines of the Great Void\nand has been wrought by the Monitory Dream Fairy in the Palace of\nUnreality and Spirituality, with the sole intent of healing the\nillnesses which originate from evil thoughts and improper designs.\nPossessing, as it does, the virtue of relieving mankind and preserving\nlife, I have consequently brought it along with me into the world, but I\nonly give it to those intelligent preëminent and refined princely men to\nset their eyes on. On no account must you look at the front side; and\nyou should only gaze at the back of it; this is urgent, this is\nexpedient! After three days, I shall come and fetch it away; by which\ntime, I’m sure, it will have made him all right.”",
        "These words finished, he walked away with leisurely step, and though all\ntried to detain him, they could not succeed.",
        "Chia Jui received the mirror. “This Taoist,” he thought, “would seem to\nspeak sensibly, and why should I not look at it and try its effect?” At\nthe conclusion of these thoughts, he took up the Mirror of\nVoluptuousness, and cast his eyes on the obverse side; but upon\nperceiving nought else than a skeleton standing in it, Chia Jui\nsustained such a fright that he lost no time in covering it with his\nhands and in abusing the Taoist. “You good-for-nothing!” he exclaimed,\n\"why should you frighten me so? but I’ll go further and look at the\nfront and see what it’s like.”",
        "While he reflected in this manner, he readily looked into the face of\nthe mirror, wherein he caught sight of lady Feng standing, nodding her\nhead and beckoning to him. With one gush of joy, Chia Jui felt himself,\nin a vague and mysterious manner, transported into the mirror, where he\nheld an affectionate tête-à-tête with lady Feng. Lady Feng escorted him\nout again. On his return to bed, he gave vent to an exclamation of “Ai\nyah!” and opening his eyes, he turned the glass over once more; but\nstill, as hitherto, stood the skeleton in the back part.",
        "Chia Jui had, it is true, experienced all the pleasant sensations of a\ntête-à-tête, but his heart nevertheless did not feel gratified; so that\nhe again turned the front round, and gazed at lady Feng, as she still\nwaved her hand and beckoned to him to go. Once more entering the mirror,\nhe went on in the same way for three or four times, until this occasion,\nwhen just as he was about to issue from the mirror, he espied two\npersons come up to him, who made him fast with chains round the neck,\nand hauled him away. Chia Jui shouted. “Let me take the mirror and I’ll\ncome along.” But only this remark could he utter, for it was forthwith\nbeyond his power to say one word more. The servants, who stood by in\nattendance, saw him at first still holding the glass in his hand and\nlooking in, and then, when it fell from his grasp, open his eyes again\nto pick it up, but when at length the mirror dropped, and he at once\nceased to move, they in a body came forward to ascertain what had\nhappened to him. He had already breathed his last. The lower part of his\nbody was icy-cold; his clothes moist from profuse perspiration. With all\npromptitude they changed him there and then, and carried him to another\nbed.",
        "Tai-ju and his wife wept bitterly for him, to the utter disregard of\ntheir own lives, while in violent terms they abused the Taoist priest.\n\"What kind of magical mirror is it?” they asked. “If we don’t destroy\nthis glass, it will do harm to not a few men in the world!”",
        "Having forthwith given directions to bring fire and burn it, a voice was\nheard in the air to say, “Who told you to look into the face of it? You\nyourselves have mistaken what is false for what is true, and why burn\nthis glass of mine?”",
        "Suddenly the mirror was seen to fly away into the air; and when Tai-ju\nwent out of doors to see, he found no one else than the limping Taoist,\nshouting, “Who is he who wishes to destroy the Mirror of\nVoluptuousness?” While uttering these words, he snatched the glass, and,\nas all eyes were fixed upon him, he moved away lissomely, as if swayed\nby the wind.",
        "Tai-ju at once made preparations for the funeral and went everywhere to\ngive notice that on the third day the obsequies would commence, that on\nthe seventh the procession would start to escort the coffin to the Iron\nFence Temple, and that on the subsequent day, it would be taken to his\noriginal home.",
        "Not much time elapsed before all the members of the Chia family came, in\na body, to express their condolences. Chia She, of the Jung Mansion,\npresented twenty taels, and Chia Cheng also gave twenty taels. Of the\nNing Mansion, Chia Chen likewise contributed twenty taels. The remainder\nof the members of the clan, of whom some were poor and some rich, and\nnot equally well off, gave either one or two taels, or three or four,\nsome more, some less. Among strangers, there were also contributions,\nrespectively presented by the families of his fellow-scholars,\namounting, likewise, collectively to twenty or thirty taels.",
        "The private means of Tai-ju were, it is true, precarious, but with the\nmonetary assistance he obtained, he anyhow performed the funeral rites\nwith all splendour and éclat.",
        "But who would have thought it, at the close of winter of this year, Lin\nJu-hai contracted a serious illness, and forwarded a letter, by some\none, with the express purpose of fetching Lin Tai-yü back. These\ntidings, when they reached dowager lady Chia, naturally added to the\ngrief and distress (she already suffered), but she felt compelled to\nmake speedy preparations for Tai-yü’s departure. Pao-yü too was\nintensely cut up, but he had no alternative but to defer to the\naffection of father and daughter; nor could he very well place any\nhindrance in the way.",
        "Old lady Chia, in due course, made up her mind that she would like Chia\nLien to accompany her, and she also asked him to bring her back again\nalong with him. But no minute particulars need be given of the manifold\nlocal presents and of the preparations, which were, of course,\neverything that could be wished for in excellence and perfectness.\nForthwith the day for starting was selected, and Chia Lien, along with\nLin Tai-yü, said good-bye to all the members of the family, and,\nfollowed by their attendants, they went on board their boats, and set\nout on their journey for Yang Chou.",
        "But, Reader, should you have any wish to know fuller details, listen to\nthe account given in the subsequent Chapter.",
        "  Ch’in K’o-ch’ing dies, and Chia Jung is invested with the rank of\n      military officer to the Imperial Body-guard.\n  Wang Hsi-feng lends her help in the management of the Jung Kuo\n      Mansion.",
        "Lady Feng, it must be added, in prosecuting our narrative, was ever\nsince Chia Lien’s departure to accompany Tai-yü to Yang Chou, really\nvery dejected at heart; and every day, when evening came, she would,\nafter simply indulging in a chat and a laugh with P’ing Erh, turn in, in\na heedless frame of mind, for the night.",
        "In the course of the night of this day, she had been sitting with P’ing\nErh by lamp-light clasping the hand-stove; and weary of doing her work\nof embroidery, she had at an early hour, given orders to warm the\nembroidered quilt, and both had gone to bed; and as she was bending her\nfingers, counting the progress of the journey, and when they should be\narriving, unexpectedly, the third watch struck.",
        "P’ing Erh had already fallen fast asleep; and lady Feng was feeling at\nlength her sleepy eyes slightly dose, when she faintly discerned Mrs.\nCh’in walk in from outside.",
        "“My dear sister-in-law,” she said as she smiled, “sleep in peace; I’m on\nmy way back to-day, and won’t even you accompany me just one stage? But\nas you and I have been great friends all along, I cannot part from you,\nsister-in-law, and have therefore come to take my leave of you. There\nis, besides, a wish of mine, which isn’t yet accomplished; and if I\ndon’t impart it to you, it isn’t likely that telling any one else will\nbe of any use.”",
        "Lady Feng could not make out the sense of the words she heard. “What\nwish is it you have?” she inquired, “do tell me, and it will be safe\nenough with me.”",
        "“You are, my dear sister-in-law, a heroine among women,” observed Mrs.\nCh’in, “so much so that those famous men, with sashes and official hats,\ncannot excel you; how is it that you’re not aware of even a couple of\nlines of common adages, of that trite saying, ’when the moon is full, it\nbegins to wane; when the waters are high, they must overflow?’ and of\nthat other which says that ’if you ascend high, heavy must be your\nfall.’ Our family has now enjoyed splendour and prosperity for already\nwell-nigh a century, but a day comes when at the height of good fortune,\ncalamity arises; and if the proverb that ’when the tree falls, the\nmonkeys scatter,’ be fulfilled, will not futile have been the reputation\nof culture and old standing of a whole generation?”",
        "Lady Feng at these words felt her heart heavy, and overpowered by\nintense awe and veneration.",
        "“The fears you express are well founded,” she urgently remarked, “but\nwhat plan is there adequate to preserve it from future injury?”",
        "“My dear sister-in-law,” rejoined Mrs. Ch’in with a sardonic smile,\n\"you’re very simple indeed! When woe has reached its climax, weal\nsupervenes. Prosperity and adversity, from days of yore up to the\r\npresent time, now pass away, and now again revive, and how can\n(prosperity) be perpetuated by any human exertion? But if now, we could\nin the time of good fortune, make provision against any worldly\nconcerns, which might arise at any season of future adversity, we might\nin fact prolong and preserve it. Everything, for instance, is at present\nwell-regulated; but there are two matters which are not on a sure\nfooting, and if such and such suitable action could be adopted with\nregard to these concerns, it will, in subsequent days, be found easy to\nperpetuate the family welfare in its entity.”",
        "“What matters are these?” inquired lady Feng.",
        "“Though at the graves of our ancestors,” explained Mrs. Ch’in,\n\"sacrifices and oblations be offered at the four seasons, there’s\nnevertheless no fixed source of income. In the second place, the family\nschool is, it is true, in existence; but it has no definite\ngrants-in-aid. According to my views, now that the times are prosperous,\nthere’s, as a matter of course, no lack of offerings and contributions;\nbut by and bye, when reverses set in, whence will these two outlays be\nmet from? Would it not be as well, and my ideas are positive on this\nscore, to avail ourselves of the present time, when riches and honours\nstill reign, to establish in the immediate vicinity of our ancestral\ntombs, a large number of farms, cottages, and estates, in order to\nenable the expenditure for offerings and grants to entirely emanate from\nthis source? And if the household school were also established on this\nprinciple, the old and young in the whole clan can, after they have, by\ncommon consent, determined upon rules, exercise in days to come control,\nin the order of the branches, over the affairs connected with the landed\nproperty, revenue, ancestral worship and school maintenance for the year\n(of their respective term.) Under this rotatory system, there will\nlikewise be no animosities; neither will there be any mortgages, or\nsales, or any of these numerous malpractices; and should any one happen\nto incur blame, his personal effects can be confiscated by Government.\nBut the properties, from which will be derived the funds for ancestral\nworship, even the officials should not be able to appropriate, so that\nwhen reverses do supervene, the sons and grandsons of the family may be\nable to return to their homes, and prosecute their studies, or go in for\nfarming. Thus, while they will have something to fall back upon, the\nancestral worship will, in like manner, be continued in perpetuity. But,\nif the present affluence and splendour be looked upon as bound to go on\nwithout intermission, and with no thought for the day to come, no\nenduring plan be after all devised, presently, in a little while, there\nwill, once again, transpire a felicitous occurrence of exceptional kind,\nwhich, in point of fact, will resemble the splendour of oil scorched on\na violent fire, or fresh flowers decorated with brocades. You should\nbear in mind that it will also be nothing more real than a transient\npageant, nothing but a short-lived pleasure! Whatever you do, don’t\nforget the proverb, that ’there’s no banquet, however sumptuous, from\nwhich the guests do not disperse;’ and unless you do, at an early date,\ntake precautions against later evils, regret will, I apprehend, be of no\navail.”",
        "“What felicitous occurrence will take place?” lady Feng inquired with\nalacrity.",
        "“The decrees of Heaven cannot be divulged; but as I have been very\nfriendly with you, sister-in-law, for so long, I will present you,\nbefore I take my leave, with two lines, which it behoves you to keep in\nmind,” rejoined Mrs. Ch’in, as she consequently proceeded to recite what\nfollows:",
        "  The three springs, when over, all radiance will wane;\n  The inmates to seek each a home will be fain.",
        "Lady Feng was bent upon making further inquiries, when she heard a\nmessenger at the second gate strike the “cloudy board” four consecutive\nblows. It was indeed the announcement of a death; and it woke up lady\nFeng with a start. A servant reported that lady Jung of the eastern\nmansion was no more.",
        "Lady Feng was so taken aback that a cold perspiration broke out all over\nher person, and she fell for a while into vacant abstraction. But she\nhad to change her costume, with all possible haste, and to come over to\nmadame Wang’s apartments.",
        "By this time, all the members of the family were aware of the tidings,\nand there was not one of them who did not feel disconsolate; one and all\nof them were much wounded at heart. The elder generation bethought\nthemselves of the dutiful submission which she had all along displayed;\nthose of the same age as herself reflected upon the friendship and\nintimacy which had ever existed with her; those younger than her\nremembered her past benevolence. Even the servants of the household,\nwhether old or young, looked back upon her qualities of sympathy with\nthe poor, pity of the destitute, affection for the old, and\nconsideration for the young; and not one of them all was there who did\nnot mourn her loss, and give way to intense grief.",
        "But these irrelevant details need not be dilated upon; suffice it to\nconfine ourselves to Pao-yü.",
        "Consequent upon Lin Tai-yü’s return home, he was left to his own self\nand felt very lonely. Neither would he go and disport himself with\nothers; but with the daily return of dusk, he was wont to retire quietly\nto sleep.",
        "On this day, while he was yet under the influence of a dream, he heard\nthe announcement of Mrs. Ch’in’s death, and turning himself round\nquickly he crept out of bed, when he felt as if his heart had been\nstabbed with a sword. With a sudden retch, he straightway expectorated a\nmouthful of blood, which so frightened Hsi Jen and the rest that they\nrushed forward and supported him.",
        "“What is the matter?” they inquired, and they meant also to go and let\ndowager lady Chia know, so as to send for a doctor, but Pao-yü dissuaded\nthem.",
        "“There’s no need of any flurry; it’s nothing at all,” he said, “it’s\nsimply that the fire of grief has attacked the heart, and that the blood\ndid not circulate through the arteries.”",
        "As he spoke, he speedily raised himself up, and, after asking for his\nclothes and changing, he came over to see dowager lady Chia. His wish\nwas to go at once to the other side; and Hsi Jen, though feeling uneasy\nat heart, seeing the state of mind he was in, did not again hinder him,\nas she felt constrained to let him please himself.",
        "When old lady Chia saw that he was bent upon going: “The breath is just\ngone out of the body,” she consequently remonstrated, “and that side is\nstill sullied. In the second place it’s now dark, and the wind is high;\nso you had better wait until to-morrow morning, when you will be in\nample time.”",
        "Pao-yü would not agree to this, and dowager lady Chia gave orders to get\nthe carriage ready, and to depute a few more attendants and followers to\ngo with him. Under this escort he went forward and straightway arrived\nin front of the Ning mansion, where they saw the main entrance wide\nopen, the lamps on the two sides giving out a light as bright as day,\nand people coming and going in confused and large numbers; while the\nsound of weeping inside was sufficient to shake the mountains and to\nmove the hills.",
        "Pao-yü dismounted from the carriage; and with hurried step, walked into\nthe apartment, where the coffin was laid. He gave vent to bitter tears\nfor a few minutes, and subsequently paid his salutations to Mrs. Yu.\nMrs. Yu, as it happened, had just had a relapse of her old complaint of\npains in the stomach and was lying on her bed.",
        "He eventually came out again from her chamber to salute Chia Chen, just\nat the very moment that Chia Tai-ju, Chia Tai-hsiu, Chia Ch’ih, Chiao\nHsiao, Chia Tun, Chia She, Chia Cheng, Chia Tsung, Chia Pin, Chia Hsing,\r\nChia Kuang, Chia Shen, Chia Ch’iung, Chia Lin, Chia Se, Chia Ch’ang,\nChia Ling, Chia Yün, Chia Ch’in, Chia Chen, Chia P’ing, Chia Tsao, Chia\nHeng, Chia Fen, Chia Fang, Chia Lan, Chia Chun, Chia Chih and the other\nrelatives of the families had likewise arrived in a body.",
        "Chia Chen wept so bitterly that he was like a man of tears. “Of the\nwhole family, whether young or old, distant relatives or close friends,\"\nhe was just explaining to Chia Tai-ju and the rest, “who did not know\nthat this girl was a hundred times better than even our son? but now\nthat her spirit has retired, it’s evident that this elder branch of the\nfamily will be cut off and that there will be no survivor.”",
        "While he gave vent to these words, he again burst into tears, and the\nwhole company of relatives set to work at once to pacify him. “She has\nalready departed this life,” they argued, “and tears are also of no\navail, besides the pressing thing now is to consult as to what kind of\narrangements are to be made.”",
        "Chia Chen clapped his hands. “What arrangements are to be made!” he\nexclaimed; “nothing is to be done, but what is within my means.”",
        "As they conversed, they perceived Ch’in Yeh and Ch’in Chung, as well as\nseveral relations of Mrs. Yu, arrive, together with Mrs. Yu’s sisters;\nand Chia Chen forthwith bade Chia Ch’ung, Chia Shen, Chia Lin and Chia\nSe, the four of them, to go and entertain the guests; while he, at the\nsame time, issued directions to go and ask the Astrologer of the\nImperial Observatory to come and choose the days for the ceremonies.",
        "(This Astrologer) decided that the coffin should remain in the house for\nseven times seven days, that is forty-nine days; that after the third\nday, the mourning rites should be begun and the formal cards should be\ndistributed; that all that was to be done during these forty-nine days\nwas to invite one hundred and eight Buddhist bonzes to perform, in the\nmain Hall, the High Confession Mass, in order to ford the souls of\ndeparted relatives across the abyss of suffering, and afterwards to\ntransmute the spirit (of Mrs. Ch’in); that, in addition, an altar should\nbe erected in the Tower of Heavenly Fragrance, where nine times nine\nvirtuous Taoist priests should, for nineteen days, offer up prayers for\nabsolution from punishment, and purification from retribution. That\nafter these services, the tablet should be moved into the Garden of\nConcentrated Fragrance, and that in the presence of the tablet, fifteen\nadditional eminent bonzes and fifteen renowned Taoist Priests should\nconfront the altar and perform meritorious deeds every seven days.",
        "The news of the death of the wife of his eldest grandson reached Chia\nChing; but as he himself felt sure that, at no distant date, he would\nascend to the regions above, he was loth to return again to his home,\nand so expose himself to the contamination of the world, as to\ncompletely waste the meritorious excellence acquired in past days. For\nthis reason, he paid no heed to the event, but allowed Chia Chen a free\nhand to accomplish the necessary preparations.",
        "Chia Chen, to whom we again revert, was fond of display and\nextravagance, so that he found, on inspection of coffins, those few made\nof pine-wood unsuitable to his taste; when, strange coincidence, Hsüeh\nP’an came to pay his visit of condolence, and perceiving that Chia Chen\nwas in quest of a good coffin: “In our establishment,” he readily\nsuggested, “we have a lot of timber of some kind or other called Ch’iang\nwood, which comes from the T’ieh Wang Mount, in Huang Hai; and which\nmade into coffins will not rot, not for ten thousand years. This lot\nwas, in fact, brought down, some years back, by my late father; and had\nat one time been required by His Highness I Chung, a Prince of the royal\nblood; but as he became guilty of some mismanagement, it was, in\nconsequence, not used, and is still lying stored up in our\nestablishment; and another thing besides is that there’s no one with the\nmeans to purchase it. But if you do want it, you should come and have a\nlook at it.”",
        "Chia Chen, upon hearing this, was extremely delighted, and gave orders\nthat the planks should be there and then brought over. When the whole\nfamily came to inspect them, they found those for the sides and the\nbottom to be all eight inches thick, the grain like betel-nut, the smell\nlike sandal-wood or musk, while, when tapped with the hand, the sound\nemitted was like that of precious stones; so that one and all agreed in\npraising the timber for its remarkable quality.",
        "“What is their price?” Chia Chen inquired with a smile.",
        "“Even with one thousand taels in hand,” explained Hsüeh P’an laughingly,\n\"I feel sure you wouldn’t find any place, where you could buy the like.\nWhy ask about price? if you just give the workmen a few taels for their\nlabour, it will be quite sufficient.”",
        "Chia Chen, at these words, lost no time in giving expression to profuse\nassurances of gratitude, and was forthwith issuing directions that the\ntimber should be split, sawn and made up, when Chia Cheng proffered his\nadvice. “Such articles shouldn’t,” he said, “be, in my idea, enjoyed by\npersons of the common run; it would be quite ample if the body were\nplaced in a coffin made of pine of the best quality.”",
        "But Chia Chen would not listen to any suggestion.",
        "Suddenly he further heard that Mrs. Ch’in’s waiting-maid, Jui Chu by\nname, had, after she had become alive to the fact that her mistress had\ndied, knocked her head against a post, and likewise succumbed to the\nblows. This unusual occurrence the whole clan extolled in high terms;\nand Chia Chen promptly directed that, with regard to ceremonies, she\nshould be treated as a granddaughter, and that the body should, after it\nhad been placed in the coffin, be also deposited in the Hall of Attained\nImmortality, in the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance.",
        "There was likewise a young waiting-maid, called Pao Chu, who, as Mrs.\nCh’in left no issue, was willing to become an adopted child, and begged\nto be allowed to undertake the charge of dashing the mourning bowl, and\naccompanying the coffin; which pleased Chia Chen so much that he\nspeedily transmitted orders that from that time forth Pao Chu should be\naddressed by all as ’young miss.’",
        "Pao Chu, after the rites of an unmarried daughter, mourned before the\ncoffin to such an unwonted degree, as if bent upon snapping her own\nlife; while the members of the entire clan, as well as the inmates of\nthe Mansions, each and all, readily observed, in their conduct, the\nestablished mourning usages, without of course any transgression or\nconfusion.",
        "“Chia Jung,” pondered Chia Chen, “has no higher status than that of\ngraduate by purchase, and were this designation written on the funeral\nstreamer, it will not be imposing, and, in point of fact, the retinue\nwill likewise be small.” He therefore was exceedingly unhappy, in his\nown mind, when, as luck would have it, on this day, which was the fourth\nday of the first seven, Tai Ch’üan, a eunuch of the Palace of High\nRenown, whose office was that of Palace Overseer, first prepared\nsacrificial presents, which he sent round by messengers, and next came\nhimself in an official chair, preceded by criers beating the gong, to\noffer sacrificial oblations.",
        "Chia Chen promptly received him, and pressed him into a seat; and when\nthey adjourned into the Hall of the Loitering Bees, tea was presented.",
        "Chia Chen had already arrived at a fixed purpose, so that he seized an\nopportunity to tell him of his wish to purchase an office for Chia\nJung’s advancement.",
        "Tai Ch’üan understood the purport of his remark. “It is, I presume,” he\nadded smilingly, “that the funeral rites should be a little more\nsumptuous.”",
        "“My worthy sir,” eagerly rejoined Chia Chen, “your surmise on that score\nis perfectly correct.”",
        "“The question,” explained Tai Ch’üan, “comes up at an opportune moment;\nfor there is just at present a good vacancy. Of the three hundred\nofficers who at present constitute the Imperial Body Guard, there are\ntwo wanting. Yesterday marquis Hsiang Yang’s third brother came to\nappeal to me with one thousand five hundred taels of ready money, which\nhe brought over to my house. You know the friendship of old standing\nwhich exists between him and me, so that, placing other considerations\naside, I without a second thought, assented for his father’s sake. But\nthere still remains another vacancy, which, who would have thought it,\nfat general Feng, of Yung Hsing, asked to purchase for his son; but I\nhave had no time to give him an answer. Besides, as our child wants to\npurchase it, you had better at once write a statement of his\nantecedents.”",
        "Chia Chen lost no time in bidding some one write the statement on red\npaper, which Tai Ch’üan found, on perusal, to record that Chia Jung was\na graduate, by purchase, of the District of Chiang Ning, of the Ying\nT’ien Prefecture, in Chiang Nan; that Chia Tai-hua, his great\ngrandfather, had been Commander-in-Chief of the Metropolitan Camp, and\nan hereditary general of the first class, with the prefix of Spiritual\nMajesty; that his grandfather Chia Ching was a metropolitan graduate of\nthe tripos in the Ping Ch’en year; and that his father Chia Chen had\ninherited a rank of nobility of the third degree, and was a general,\nwith the prefix of Majestic Intrepidity.",
        "Tai Ch’üan, after perusal, turned his hand behind him and passed (the\nstatement) to a constant attendant of his, to put away: “Go back,” he\nenjoined him, “and give it to His Excellency Mr. Chao, at the head of\nthe Board of Revenue, and tell him, that I present him my compliments,\nand would like him to draw up a warrant for subaltern of the Imperial\nBody Guard of the fifth grade, and to also issue a commission; that he\nshould take the particulars from this statement and fill them up; and\nthat to-morrow I’ll come and have the money weighed and sent over.”",
        "The young attendant signified his obedience, and Tai Ch’üan thereupon\ntook his leave. Chia Chen did all he could to detain him, but with no\nsuccess; so that he had no alternative but to escort him as far as the\nentrance of the Mansion. As he was about to mount into his chair, Chia\nChen inquired, “As regards the money, shall I go and pay it into the\nBoard, or am I to send it to the Board of Eunuchs?”",
        "“If you were to go and pay it at the Board,” observed Tai Ch’üan; “you\nare sure to suffer loss; so that it would be better if you just weighed\nexactly one thousand taels and sent them over to my place; for then an\nend will be put to all trouble.”",
        "Chia Chen was incessant in his expression of gratitude. “When the period\nof mourning has expired,” he consequently added, “I shall lead in\nperson, my despicable eldest son to your mansion, to pay our obeisance,\nand express our thanks.”",
        "They then parted company, but close upon this, were heard again the\nvoices of runners. It was, in fact, the spouse of Shih Ting, the marquis\nof Chung Ching, who was just arriving. Shih Hsiang-yun, mesdames Wang,\nand Hsing, lady Feng and the rest came out at once, to greet her, and\nlead her into the Main Building; when they further saw the sacrificial\npresents of the three families, of the marquis of Chin Hsiang, the\nmarquis of Ch’uan Ning, and the earl of Shou Shan, likewise spread out\nin front of the tablet.",
        "In a short while, these three noblemen descended from their chairs, and\nChia Chen received them in the Large Hall. In like manner all the\nrelatives and friends arrived in such quick succession, one coming,\nanother going, that it is impossible to remember even so much as their\nnumber. One thing need be said that during these forty-nine days the\nstreet on which the Ning Kuo mansion stood, was covered with a sheet of\nwhite, formed by the people, coming and going; and thronged with\nclusters of flowers, as the officials came and went.",
        "At the instance of Chia Chen, Chia Jung, the next day donned his gala\r\ndress and went over for his papers; and on his return the articles in\nuse in front of the coffin, as well as those belonging to the cortege\nand other such things, were all regulated by the rules prescribed for an\nofficial status of the fifth degree; while, on the tablet and notice\nalike the inscription consisted of: Spirit of lady Ch’in, (by marriage)\nof the Chia mansion, and by patent a lady of the fifth rank (of the\ntitles of honour).",
        "The main entrance of the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance, adjoining the\nstreet, was opened wide; and on both sides were raised sheds for the\nmusicians, and two companies of players, dressed in blue, discoursed\nmusic at the proper times; while one pair after another of the\nparaphernalia was drawn out so straight as if cut by a knife or slit by\nan axe. There were also two large carmine boards, carved with gilt\ninscriptions, erected outside the gate; the designations in bold\ncharacters on the upper sides being: Guard of the Imperial Antechamber,\ncharged with the protection of the Inner Palace and Roads, in the Red\nProhibited City.",
        "On the opposite side, facing each other, rose, high above the ground,\ntwo altars for the services of the Buddhist and Taoist priests, while a\nplacard bore the inscription in bold type: Funeral Obsequies of lady\nCh’in, (by marriage) of the Chia mansion, by patent a lady of the fifth\nrank, consort of the eldest grandson of the hereditary duke of Ning Kuo,\nand guard of the Imperial Antechamber, charged with the protection of\nthe Inner Palace and Roads in the Red Prohibited City. We, Wan Hsü, by\nHeaven’s commands charged with the perennial preservation of perfect\npeace in the Kingdom of the Four Continents, as well as of the lands\ncontained therein, Head Controller of the School of Void and Asceticism,\nand Superior in Chief (of the Buddhist hierarchy); and Yeh Sheng,\nPrincipal Controller, since the creation, of the Disciples of Perfect\nExcellence and Superior in Chief (of the Taoist priesthood), and others,\nhaving in a reverent spirit purified ourselves by abstinence, now raise\nour eyes up to Heaven, prostrate ourselves humbly before Buddha, and\ndevoutly pray all the Chia Lans, Chieh Tis, Kung Ts’aos and other\ndivinities to extend their sacred bounties, and from afar to display\ntheir spiritual majesty, during the forty-nine days (of the funeral\nrites), for the deliverance from judgment and the absolution from\nretribution (of the spirit of lady Ch’in), so that it may enjoy a\npeaceful and safe passage, whether by sea or by land; and other such\nprayers to this effect, which are in fact not worth the trouble of\nputting on record.",
        "Chia Chen had, it is true, all his wishes gratified; but, as his wife\nwas laid up in the inner chambers, with a relapse of her old complaint,\nand was not in a fit state to undertake the direction of the ceremonies,\nhe was very much distressed lest, when the high officials (and their\nwives) came and went, there should occur any breach of the prescribed\nconventionalities, which he was afraid would evoke ridicule. Hence it\nwas that he felt in low spirits; but while he was plunged in solicitude\nPao-yü, who happened to be close by, readily inquired, “Everything may\nbe safely looked upon as being satisfactorily settled, and why need you,\nelder brother, still be so full of concern?”",
        "Chia Chen forthwith explained to him how it was that in the ladies’\napartments there was no one (to do the honours), but Pao-yü at these\nwords smiled: “What difficulty is there about it?” he remarked; “I’ll\nrecommend some one to take temporary charge of the direction of things\nfor you during the month, and I can guarantee that everything will be\nproperly carried out.”",
        "“Who is it?” Chia Chen was quick to ask; but as Pao-yü perceived that\nthere were still too many relatives and friends seated around, he did\nnot feel as if he could very well speak out; so that he went up to Chia\nChen and whispered a couple of remarks in his ear.",
        "Chia Chen’s joy knew no bounds when he heard this suggestion.\n\"Everything will indeed be properly carried out,” he added laughingly;\n\"but I must now be going at once.”",
        "With these words, he drew Pao-yü along, and taking leave of the whole\nnumber of visitors, they forthwith came into the drawing rooms.",
        "This day was luckily not a grand occasion, so that few relatives and\nfriends had come. In the inner apartments there were only a small number\nof ladies of close kinship. Mesdames Hsing and Wang, and lady Feng, and\nthe women of the whole household, were entertaining the guests, when\nthey heard a servant announce that Mr. Chia Chen had come. (This\nannouncement) took the whole body of ladies and young ladies so much by\nsurprise, that, with a rushing sound, they tried to hide in the back\nrooms; but they were not quick enough (to effect their escape).",
        "Lady Feng alone composedly stood up. Chia Chen was himself at this time\nrather unwell, and being also very much cut up, he entered the room\nshuffling along, propping himself up with a staff.",
        "“You are not well?” therefore remarked madame Hsing and the others, “and\nyou’ve had besides so much to attend to during these consecutive days,\nthat what you require is rest to get all right; and why do you again\ncome over?”",
        "Chia Chen was, as he leant on his staff, straining every nerve to bend\nhis body so as to fall on his knees and pay his respects to them, and\nexpress his sense of obligation for the trouble they had taken, when\nmadame Hsing and the other ladies hastily called Pao-yü to raise him up,\nbidding a servant move a chair for him to sit on. Chia Chen would not\ntake a seat; but making an effort to return a smile, “Your nephew,” he\nurged, “has come over, as there’s a favour that I want to ask of my two\naunts as well as of my eldest cousin.”",
        "“What is it?” promptly inquired madame Hsing and the rest.",
        "“My aunts,” Chia Chen replied with all haste, “you surely are aware that\nyour grandson’s wife is now no more; your nephew’s wife is also laid up\nunwell, and, as I see that things in the inner apartments are really not\nwhat they should properly be, I would trouble my worthy eldest cousin to\nundertake in here the direction of affairs for a month; and if she does,\nmy mind will be set at ease.”",
        "Madame Hsing smiled. “Is it really about this that you’ve come?” she\nasked; “your eldest cousin is at present staying with your aunt Secunda,\nand all you have to do is to speak to her and it will be all right.”",
        "“How ever could a mere child like her,” speedily remonstrated madame\nWang, “carry out all these matters? and shouldn’t she manage things\nproperly, she will, on the contrary, make people laugh, so it would\ntherefore be better that you should trouble some one else.”",
        "“What your ideas are, aunt,” rejoined Chia Chen smiling, “your nephew\nhas guessed; you’re afraid lest my eldest cousin should have to bear\nfatigue and annoyance; for as to what you say, that she cannot manage\nthings, why my eldest cousin has, from her youth up, ever been in her\nromping and playing so firm and decided; and now that she has entered\nthe married estate, and has the run of affairs in that mansion, she must\nhave reaped so much the more experience, and have become quite an old\nhand! I’ve been thinking these last few days that outside my eldest\ncousin, there’s no one else who could come to my help; and, aunt, if you\ndon’t do it for the face of your nephew and your nephew’s wife, do it,\nat least, for the affection you bore to her who is no more.”",
        "While he uttered these words tears trickled down his face. The fears\nthat madame Wang inwardly entertained were that lady Feng had no\nexperience in funeral matters, and she apprehended, that if she was not\nequal to managing them, she would incur the ridicule of others; but when\nshe now heard Chia Chen make the appeal in such a disconsolate mood, she\nrelented considerably in her resolution. But as she turned her eyes\ntowards lady Feng (to ascertain her wishes), she saw that she was\nplunged in abstraction.",
        "Lady Feng had all along found the greatest zest in taking the initiative\nin everything, with the idea of making a display of her abilities, so\nthat when she perceived how earnest Chia Chen was in his entreaties, she\nhad, at an early period, made up her mind to give a favourable reply.\nSeeing besides madame Wang show signs of relenting, she readily turned\nround and said to her, “My elder cousin has made his appeal in such a\nsolicitous way that your ladyship should give your consent and have done\nwith it.”",
        "“Do you think you are equal to the task?” inquired madame Wang in a\nwhisper.",
        "“What’s there that I couldn’t be equal to?” replied lady Feng; “for\nurgent matters outside, my cousin may be said to have already made full\nprovision; and all there is to be done is to keep an eye over things\ninside. But should there occur anything that I don’t know, I can ask\nyou, madame, and it will be right.”",
        "Madame Wang perceiving the reasonableness of what she heard her say,\nuttered not a word, and when Chia Chen saw that lady Feng had assented;\n\"How much you do attend to I don’t mind,” he observed, forcing another\nsmile, “but I must, in any case, entreat you, cousin, to assume the\nonerous charge. As a first step I’ll pay my obeisance to you in here,\nand when everything has been finished, I shall then come over into that\nmansion to express my thanks.”",
        "With these words still on his lips, he made a low bow, but lady Feng had\nscarcely had time to return the compliment, before Chia Chen had\ndirected a servant to fetch the warrant of the Ning mansion, which he\nbade Pao-yü hand over to lady Feng.",
        "“Cousin,” he added, “take whatever steps you think best; and if you want\nanything, all you have to do is to simply send for it with this, and\nthere will even be no use to consult me. The only thing I must ask you\nis, not to be too careful in order to save me expense, for the main\nconsideration is that things should be handsomely done. In the second\nplace, it will be well if you were also to treat servants here in the\nsame way as in the other mansion, and not be too scrupulous in the fear\nthat any one might take offence. Outside these two concerns, there’s\nnothing else to disturb my mind.”",
        "Lady Feng did not venture to take over the warrant at once, but merely\nturned round to ascertain what were madame Wang’s wishes.",
        "“In view of the reason brother Chen advances,” madame Wang rejoined,\n\"you had better assume the charge at once and finish with it; don’t,\nhowever, act on your own ideas; but when there’s aught to be done, be\ncareful and send some one to consult your cousin’s wife, ever so little\nthough it be on the subject.”",
        "Pao-yü had already taken over the warrant from Chia Chen’s grasp, and\nforcibly handed it to lady Feng, “Will you, cousin,” he went on to\nquestion, “take up your quarters here or will you come every day? should\nyou cross over, day after day, it will be ever so much more fatiguing\nfor you, so that I shall speedily have a separate court got ready for\nyou in here, where you, cousin, can put up for these several days and be\nmore comfortable.”",
        "“There’s no need,” replied lady Feng smiling; “for on that side they\ncan’t do without me; and it will be better if I were to come daily.”",
        "“Do as you like,” Chia Chen observed; and after subsequently passing a\nfew more irrelevant remarks, he at length left the room.",
        "After a time, the lady relatives dispersed, and madame Wang seized the\nopportunity to inquire of lady Feng, “What do you purpose doing to-day?”",
        "“You had better, please madame, go back,” urged lady Feng, “for I must\nfirst of all find out some clue before I can go home.”",
        "Madame Wang, upon hearing these words, returned to her quarters, in\nadvance, in company with madame Hsing, where we will leave them.",
        "Lady Feng meanwhile came into a colonnade, which enclosed a suite of\nthree apartments, and taking a seat, she gave way to reflection. “The\nfirst consideration,” she communed within herself, “is that the\nhousehold is made up of mixed elements, and things might be lost; the\nsecond is that the preparations are under no particular control, with\nthe result that, when the time comes, the servants might shirk their\nduties; the third is that the necessary expenditure being great, there\nwill be reckless disbursements and counterfeit receipts; the fourth,\nthat with the absence of any distinction in the matter of duties,\nwhether large or small, hardship and ease will be unequally shared; and\nthe fifth, that the servants being arrogant, through leniency, those\nwith any self-respect will not brook control, while those devoid of\n’face’ will not be able to improve their ways.”",
        "These five were, in point of fact, usages in vogue in the Ning mansion.\nBut as you are unable, reader, to ascertain here how lady Feng set\nthings right, listen to the explanations given in the following chapter.",
        "  Lin Ju-hai dies in the City of Yang Chou.\n  Chia Pao-yü meets the Prince of Pei Ching on the way.",
        "When Lai Sheng, be it noticed in continuing our story, the major-domo in\nthe Ning Kuo mansion, came to hear that from inside an invitation had\nbeen extended to lady Feng to act as deputy, he summoned together his\nco-workers and other servants. “Lady Secunda, of the western mansion,\"\nhe harangued them, “has now been asked to take over the control of\ninternal affairs; and should she come we must, when we apply for\nanything, or have anything to say, be circumspect in our service; we\nshould all every day come early and leave late; and it’s better that we\nshould exert ourselves during this one month and take rest after it’s\nover. We mustn’t throw away our old ’face,’ for she’s well known to be\nan impetuous thing, with a soured face and a hard heart, who, when\nangry, knows no distinction of persons.”",
        "The whole company unanimously admitted that he was right; and one of\ntheir number too observed smilingly, “It’s but right that for the inner\napartments, we should, in fact, get her to come and put things in proper\norder, as everything is very much what it should not be.”",
        "But while he uttered these words, they saw Lai Wang’s wife coming, with\nan indent in hand, to fetch paper for the supplications and prayers, the\namount of which was mentioned on the order; and they one and all\nhastened to press her into a seat, and to help her to a cup of tea;\nwhile a servant was told to fetch the quantity of paper required. (When\nit was brought,) Lai Wang carried it in his arms and came, the whole way\nwith his wife, as far as the ceremonial gate; when he, at length,\ndelivered it over to her and she clasped it, and walked into the room\nall alone.",
        "Lady Feng issued prompt directions to Ts’ai Ming to prepare a register;\nand sending, there and then, for Lai Sheng’s wife, she asked her to\nsubmit, for her perusal, the roll with the servants’ names. She\nfurthermore fixed upon an early hour of the following day to convene the\ndomestics and their wives in the mansion, in order that they should\nreceive their orders; but, after cursorily glancing over the number of\nentries in the list, and making a few inquiries of Lai Sheng’s wife, she\nsoon got into her curricle, and went home.",
        "On the next day, at six and two quarters, she speedily came over. The\nmatrons and married women of the Ning Kuo mansion assembled together, as\nsoon as they heard of her arrival; but, perceiving lady Feng, assisted\nby Lai Sheng’s wife, engaged in apportioning the duties of each servant,\nthey could not presume to intrude, but remained outside the window\nlistening to what was going on.",
        "“As I’ve been asked to take over the charge,” they heard lady Feng\nexplain to Lai Sheng’s wife, “I’m, needless to say, sure to incur the\ndispleasure of you all, for I can’t compare with your mistress, who has\nsuch a sweet temper, and allows you to have your own way. But saying\nnothing more of those ways, which prevailed hitherto among your people\nin this mansion, you must now do as I tell you; for on the slightest\ndisregard of my orders, I shall, with no discrimination between those\nwho may be respectable and those who may not be, clearly and distinctly\ncall all alike to account.”",
        "Having concluded these remarks, she went on to order Ts’ai Ming to read\nthe roll; and, as their names were uttered, one by one was called in,\nand passed under inspection. After this inspection, which was got over\nin a short time, she continued giving further directions. “These\ntwenty,” she said “should be divided into two companies; ten in each\ncompany, whose sole daily duties should be to attend inside to the\nguests, coming and going, and to serve tea for them; while with any\nother matters, they needn’t have anything to do. These other twenty\nshould also be divided into two companies, whose exclusive duties will\nbe, day after day, to look after the tea and eatables of the relatives\nof our family; and these too will have no business to concern themselves\nwith outside matters. These forty will again be divided into two\ncompanies, who will have nothing else to look to than to remain in front\nof the coffin and offer incense, renew the oil, hang up the streamers,\nwatch the coffin, offer sacrifices of rice, and oblations of tea, and\nmourn with the mourners; and neither need they mind anything outside\nthese duties. These four servants will be specially attached to the\ninner tea-rooms to look after cups, saucers and the tea articles\ngenerally; and in the event of the loss of any single thing, the four of\nthem will have to make it good between them. These other four servants\nwill have the sole charge of the articles required for eatables and\nwine; and should any get mislaid compensation will have likewise to be\nmade by them. These eight servants will only have to attend to taking\nover the sacrificial offerings; while these eight will have nothing more\nto see to beyond keeping an eye over the lamps, oil, candles and paper\nwanted everywhere. I’ll have a whole supply served out and handed to you\neight to by and by apportion to the various places, in quantities which\nI will determine. These thirty servants are each day, by rotation, to\nkeep watch everywhere during the night, looking after the gates and\nwindows, taking care of the fires and candles, and sweeping the grounds;\nwhile the servants, who remain, are to be divided for duty in the houses\nand rooms, each one having charge of a particular spot. And beginning\nfrom the tables, chairs and curios in each place, up to the very\ncuspidors and brooms, yea even to each blade of grass or sprout of herb,\nwhich may be there, the servants looking after this part will be called\nupon to make good anything that may be either mislaid or damaged. You,\nLai Sheng’s wife, will every day have to exercise general supervision\nand inspection; and should there be those who be lazy, any who may\ngamble, drink, fight or wrangle, come at once and report the matter to\nme; and you mustn’t show any leniency, for if I come to find it out, I\nshall have no regard to the good old name of three or four generations,\nwhich you may enjoy. You now all have your fixed duties, so that\nwhatever batch of you after this acts contrary to these orders, I shall\nsimply have something to say to that batch and to no one else. The\nservants, who have all along been in my service, carry watches on their\npersons, and things, whether large or small, are invariably done at a\nfixed time. But, in any case, you also have clocks in your master’s\nrooms, so that at 6.30, I shall come and read the roll, and at ten\nyou’ll have breakfast. Whenever there is any indent of any permits to be\nmade or any report to be submitted, it should be done at 11.30 a.m. and\nno later. At 7 p.m., after the evening paper has been burnt, I shall\ncome to each place in person to hold an inspection; and on my return,\nthe servants on watch for the night will hand over the keys. The next\nday, I shall again come over at 6.30 in the morning; and needless to say\nwe must all do the best we can for these few days; and when the work has\nbeen finished your master is sure to recompense you.”",
        "When she had done speaking, she went on to give orders that tea, oil,\ncandles, feather dusters, brooms and other necessaries should be issued,\naccording to the fixed quantities. She also had furniture, such as\ntable-covers, antimacassars, cushions, rugs, cuspidors, stools and the\nlike brought over and distributed; while, at the same time, she took up\nthe pencil and made a note of the names of the persons in charge of the\nvarious departments, and of the articles taken over by the respective\nservants, in entries remarkable for the utmost perspicacity.",
        "The whole body of servants received their charge and left; but they all\nhad work to go and attend to; not as in former times, when they were at\nliberty to select for themselves what was convenient to do, while the\narduous work, which remained over, no one could be found to take in\nhand. Neither was it possible for them in the various establishments to\nany longer avail themselves of the confusion to carelessly mislay\nthings. In fact, visitors came and guests left, but everything after all\nwent off quietly, unlike the disorderly way which prevailed hitherto,\nwhen there was no clue to the ravel; and all such abuses as indolence,\nand losses, and the like were completely eradicated.",
        "Lady Feng, on her part, (perceiving) the weight her influence had in\nenjoining the observance of her directions, was in her heart exceedingly\ndelighted. But as she saw, that Chia Chen was, in consequence of Mrs.\nYu’s indisposition, even so much the more grieved as to take very little\nto drink or to eat, she daily, with her own hands, prepared, in the\nother mansion, every kind of fine congee and luscious small dishes,\nwhich she sent over, in order that he might be tempted to eat.",
        "And Chia Lien had likewise given additional directions that every day\nthe finest delicacies should be taken into the ante-chamber, for the\nexclusive use of lady Feng.",
        "Lady Feng was not one to shirk exertion and fatigue, so that, day after\nday, she came over at the proper time, called the roll, and managed\nbusiness, sitting all alone in the ante-chamber, and not congregating\nwith the whole bevy of sisters-in-law. Indeed, even when relatives or\nvisitors came or went, she did not go to receive them, or see them off.",
        "This day was the thirty-fifth day, the very day of the fifth seven, and\nthe whole company of bonzes had just (commenced the services) for\nunclosing the earth, and breaking Hell open; for sending a light to show\nthe way to the departed spirit; for its being admitted to an audience by\nthe king of Hell; for arresting all the malicious devils, as well as for\nsoliciting the soul-saving Buddha to open the golden bridge and to lead\nthe way with streamers. The Taoist priests were engaged in reverently\nreading the prayers; in worshipping the Three Pure Ones and in\nprostrating themselves before the Gemmy Lord. The disciples of\nabstraction were burning incense, in order to release the hungered\nspirits, and were reading the water regrets manual. There was also a\ncompany of twelve nuns of tender years, got up in embroidered dresses,\nand wearing red shoes, who stood before the coffin, silently reading all\nthe incantations for the reception of the spirit (from the lower\nregions,) with the result that the utmost bustle and stir prevailed.",
        "Lady Feng, well aware that not a few guests would call on this day, was\nquick to get out of bed at four sharp, to dress her hair and perform her\nablutions. After having completed every arrangement for the day, she\nchanged her costume, washed her hands, and swallowed a couple of\nmouthfuls of milk. By the time she had rinsed her mouth, it was exactly\n6.30; and Lai Wang’s wife, at the head of a company of servants, had\nbeen waiting a good long while, when lady Feng appeared in front of the\nEntrance Hall, mounted her carriage and betook herself, preceded by a\npair of transparent horn lanterns, on which were written, in large type,\nthe three characters, Jung Kuo mansion, to the main entrance gate of the\nNing Household. The door lanterns shed brilliant rays from where they\nwere suspended; while on either side the lanterns, of uniform colours,\npropped upright, emitted a lustrous light as bright as day.",
        "The servants of the family, got up in their mourning clothes, covered\nthe ground far and wide like a white sheet. They stood drawn in two\nrows, and requested that the carriage should drive up to the main\nentrance. The youths retired, and all the married women came forward,\nand raising the curtain of the carriage, lady Feng alighted; and as with\none arm she supported herself on Feng Erh, two married women, with\nlanterns in their hands, lighted the way. Pressed round by the servants,\nlady Feng made her entry. The married women of the Ning mansion advanced\nto greet her, and to pay their respects; and this over, lady Feng, with\ngraceful bearing, entered the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance.\nAscending the Spirit Hall, where the tablet was laid, the tears, as soon\nas she caught sight of the coffin, trickled down her eyes like pearls\nwhose string had snapped; while the youths in the court, and their\nnumber was not small, stood in a reverent posture, with their arms\nagainst their sides, waiting to burn the paper. Lady Feng uttered one\nremark, by way of command: “Offer the tea and burn the paper!” when the\nsound of two blows on the gong was heard and the whole band struck up\ntogether. A servant had at an early period placed a large armchair in\nfront of the tablet, and lady Feng sat down, and gave way to loud\nlamentations. Promptly all those, who stood inside or outside, whether\nhigh or low, male or female, took up the note, and kept on wailing and\nweeping until Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu, after a time, sent a message to\nadvise her to withhold her tears; when at length lady Feng desisted.",
        "Lai Wang’s wife served the tea; and when she had finished rinsing her\nmouth, lady Feng got up; and, taking leave of all the members of the\nclan, she walked all alone into the ante-chamber, where she ascertained,\nin the order of their names, the number of the servants of every\ndenomination in there. They were all found to be present, with the\nexception of one, who had failed to appear, whose duties consisted in\nreceiving and escorting the relatives and visitors. Orders were promptly\ngiven to summon him, and the man appeared in a dreadful fright. “What!\"\nexclaimed lady Feng, as she forced a smile, “is it you who have been\nremiss? Is it because you’re more respectable than they that you don’t\nchoose to listen to my words?”",
        "“Your servant,” he pleaded, “has come at an early hour every day; and\nit’s only to-day that I come late by one step; and I entreat your\nladyship to forgive this my first offence.”",
        "While yet he spoke, she perceived the wife of Wang Hsing, of the Jung\nKuo mansion, come forward and pop her head in to see what was going on;\nbut lady Feng did not let this man go, but went on to inquire of Wang\nHsing’s wife what she had come for.",
        "Wang Hsing’s wife drew near. “I’ve come,” she explained, “to get an\norder, so as to obtain some thread to make tassels for the carriages and\nchairs.” Saying this, she produced the permit and handed it up,\nwhereupon lady Feng directed Ts’ai Ming to read the contents aloud. “For\ntwo large, sedan chairs,” he said, “four small sedan chairs and four\ncarriages, are needed in all so many large and small tassels, each\ntassel requiring so many catties of beads and thread.”",
        "Lady Feng finding, after she had heard what was read, that the numbers\n(and quantities) corresponded, forthwith bade Ts’ai Ming make the proper\nentry; and when the order from the Jung Kuo mansion had been fetched,\nand thrown at her, Wang Hsing’s wife took her departure.",
        "Lady Feng was on the very point of saying something, when she espied\nfour managers of the Jung Kuo mansion walk in; all of whom wanted\npermits to indent for stores. Having asked them to read out the list of\nwhat they required, she ascertained that they wanted four kinds of\narticles in all. Drawing attention to two items: “These entries,” she\nremarked, “are wrong; and you had better go again and make out the\naccount clearly, and then come and fetch a permit.”",
        "With these words, she flung down the requisitions, and the two men went\ntheir way in lower spirits than when they had come.",
        "Lady Feng then caught sight of the wife of Chang Ts’ai standing by, and\nasked her what was her business, whereupon Chang Ts’ai’s wife promptly\nproduced an indent. “The covers of the carriages and sedan chairs,” she\nreported, “have just been completed, and I’ve come to fetch the amount\ndue to the tailors for wages.”",
        "Lady Feng, upon hearing her explanation, took over the indent, and\ndirected Ts’ai Ming to enter the items in the book. After Wang Hsing had\nhanded over the money, and obtained the receipt of the accountant, duly\nsigned, which tallied with the payment, he subsequently walked away in\ncompany with Chang Ts’ai’s wife. Lady Feng simultaneously proceeded to\ngive orders that another indent should be read, which was for money to\npurchase paper with to paste on the windows of Pao-yü’s outer\nschool-room, the repairs to which had been brought to completion, and as\nsoon as lady Feng heard the nature of the application, she there and\nthen gave directions that the permit should be taken over and an entry\nmade, and that the money should be issued after Chang Ts’ai’s wife had\ndelivered everything clearly.",
        "“If to-morrow he were to come late,” lady Feng then remarked, “and if\nthe day after, I were to come late; why by and by there’ll be no one\nhere at all! I should have liked to have let you off, but if I be\nlenient with you on this first instance, it will be hard for me, on the\noccurrence of another offence, to exercise any control over the rest.\nIt’s much better therefore that I should settle accounts with you.”",
        "The moment she uttered these words, she put on a serious look, and gave\norders that he should be taken out and administered twenty blows with\nthe bamboo. When the servants perceived that lady Feng was in an angry\nmood, they did not venture to dilly-dally, but dragged him out, and gave\nhim the full number of blows; which done, they came in to report that\nthe punishment had been inflicted.",
        "Lady Feng likewise threw down the Ning Mansion order and exclaimed,\naddressing herself to Lai Sheng: “Cut him a month’s wages and rice! and\ntell them all to disperse, and have done with it!”",
        "All the servants at length withdrew to attend to their respective\nduties, while the man too, who had been flogged, walked away, as he did\nall he could to conceal his shame and stifle his tears. About this time\narrived and went, in an incessant stream, servants from both the Jung\nand Ning mansions, bent upon applying for permits and returning permits,\nand with one by one again did lady Feng settle accounts. And, as in due\ncourse, the inmates of the Ning mansion came to know how terrible lady\nFeng was, each and all were ever since so wary and dutiful that they did\nnot venture to be lazy.",
        "But without going into further details on this subject, we shall now\nreturn to Pao-yü. Seeing that there were a lot of people about and\nfearing lest Ch’in Chung might receive some offence, he lost no time in\ncoming along with him to sit over at lady Feng’s. Lady Feng was just\nhaving her repast, and upon seeing them arrive: “Your legs are long\nenough, and couldn’t you have come somewhat quicker!” she laughingly\nobserved.",
        "“We’ve had our rice, thanks,” replied Pao-yü.",
        "“Have you had it,” inquired lady Feng, “outside here, or over on the\nother side?”",
        "“Would we eat anything with all that riff-raff?” exclaimed Pao-yü;\n\"we’ve really had it over there; in fact, I now come after having had\nmine with dowager lady Chia.”",
        "As he uttered these words, they took their seats. Lady Feng had just\nfinished her meal, when a married woman from the Ning mansion came to\nget an order to obtain an advance of money to purchase incense and\nlanterns with.",
        "“I calculated,” observed lady Feng, “that you would come to-day to make\nrequisition, but I was under the impression that you had forgotten; had\nyou really done so you would certainly have had to get them on your own\naccount, and I would have been the one to benefit.”",
        "“Didn’t I forget? I did,” rejoined the married woman as she smiled; “and\nit’s only a few minutes back that it came to my mind; had I been one\nsecond later I wouldn’t have been in time to get the things.”",
        "These words ended, she took over the order and went off. Entries had, at\nthe time to be made in the books, and orders to be issued, and Ch’in\nChung was induced to interpose with a smirk, “In both these mansions of\nyours, such orders are alike in use; but were any outsider stealthily to\ncounterfeit one and to abscond, after getting the money, what could ever\nbe done?”",
        "“In what you say,” replied lady Feng, “you take no account of the laws\nof the land.”",
        "“How is it that from our house, no one comes to get any orders or to\nobtain anything?” Pao-yü having inquired: “At the time they come to\nfetch them,” rejoined lady Feng, “you’re still dreaming; but let me ask\nyou one thing, when will you two at last begin your evening course of\nstudies?”",
        "“Oh, I wish we were able to begin our studies this very day,” Pao-yü\nadded; “that would be the best thing, but they’re very slow in putting\nthe school-room in order, so that there’s no help for it!”",
        "Lady Feng laughed. “Had you asked me,” she remarked, “I can assure you\nit would have been ready quick enough.”",
        "“You too would have been of no use,” observed Pao-yü, “for it will\ncertainly be ready by the time they ought to finish it in.”",
        "“But in order that they should do the work,” suggested lady Feng, “it’s\nalso necessary that they should have the material, they can’t do without\nthem; and if I don’t give them any permits, it will be difficult to\nobtain them.”",
        "Pao-yü at these words readily drew near to lady Feng, and there and then\napplied for the permits. “My dear sister,” he added, “do give them the\npermits to enable them to obtain the material and effect the repairs.”",
        "“I feel quite sore from fatigue,” ventured lady Feng, “and how can I\nstand your rubbing against me? but compose your mind. They have this\nvery day got the paper, and gone to paste it; and would they, for\nwhatever they need, have still waited until they had been sent for? they\nare not such fools after all!”",
        "Pao-yü would not believe it, and lady Feng at once called Ts’ai Ming to\nlook up the list, which she handed for Pao-yü’s inspection; but while\nthey were arguing a servant came in to announce that Chao Erh, who had\ngone to Su Chow, had returned, and lady Feng all in a flurry directed\nthat he should be asked to walk in. Chao Erh bent one knee and paid his\nobeisance.",
        "“Why have you come back?” lady Feng readily inquired.",
        "“Mr. Secundus (Chia Lien),” he reported, “sent me back to tell you that\nMr. Lin (our dowager lady’s) son-in-law, died on the third of the ninth\nmoon; that Master Secundus is taking Miss Lin along with him to escort\nthe coffin of Mr. Lin as far as Su Chow; and that they hope to be back\nsome time about the end of the year. Master despatched me to come and\nannounce the news, to bring his compliments, and to crave our old lady’s\ninstructions as well as to see how you are getting on in my lady’s home.\nHe also bade me take back to him a few long fur pelisses.”",
        "“Have you seen any one else besides me?” lady Feng inquired.",
        "“I’ve seen every one,” rejoined Chao Erh; and withdrew hastily at the\nconclusion of this remark, out of the apartment, while lady Feng turned\ntowards Pao-yü with a smile and said, “Your cousin Lin can now live in\nour house for ever.”",
        "“Poor thing!” exclaimed Pao-yü. “I presume that during all these days\nshe has wept who knows how much;” and saying this he wrinkled his brow\nand heaved a deep sigh.",
        "Lady Feng saw Chao Erh on his return, but as she could not very well, in\nthe presence of third persons, make minute inquiries after Chia Lien,\nshe had to continue a prey to inward solicitude till it was time to go\nhome, for, not having got through what she had to do, she was compelled\nto wait patiently until she went back in the evening, when she again\nsent word for Chao Erh to come in, and asked him with all minuteness\nwhether the journey had been pleasant throughout, and for full\nparticulars. That very night, she got in readiness the long pelisses,\nwhich she herself, with the assistance of P’ing Erh, packed up in a\nbundle; and after careful thought as to what things he would require,\nshe put them in the same bundle and committed them to Chao Erh’s care.\nShe went on to solicitously impress upon Chao Erh to be careful in his\nattendance abroad. “Don’t provoke your master to wrath,” she said, “and\nfrom time to time do advise him not to drink too much wine; and don’t\nentice him to make the acquaintance of any low people; for if you do,\nwhen you come back I will cut your leg off.”",
        "The preparations were hurriedly and confusedly completed; and it was\nalready the fourth watch of the night when she went to sleep. But soon\nagain the day dawned, and after hastily performing her toilette and\nablutions, she came over to the Ning Mansion.",
        "As Chia Chen realised that the day for escorting the body away was\ndrawing nigh, he in person went out in a curricle, along with\ngeomancers, to the Temple of the Iron Fence to inspect a suitable place\nfor depositing the coffin. He also, point by point, enjoined the\nresident managing-bonze, Se K’ung, to mind and get ready brand-new\narticles of decoration and furniture, and to invite a considerable\nnumber of bonzes of note to be at hand to lend their services for the\nreception of the coffin.",
        "Se K’ung lost no time in getting ready the evening meal, but Chia Chen\nhad, in fact, no wish for any tea or rice; and, as the day was far\nadvanced and he was not in time to enter the city, he had, after all, to\nrest during that night as best he could in a “chaste” room in the\ntemple. The next morning, as soon as it was day, he hastened to come\ninto the city and to make every preparation for the funeral. He likewise\ndeputed messengers to proceed ahead to the Temple of the Iron Fence to\ngive, that very night, additional decorative touches to the place where\nthe coffin was to be deposited, and to get ready tea and all the other\nnecessaries, for the use of the persons who would be present at the\nreception of the coffin.",
        "Lady Feng, seeing that the day was not far distant, also apportioned\nduties and made provision for everything beforehand with circumspect\ncare; while at the same time she chose in the Jung mansion, such\ncarriages, sedan chairs and retinue as were to accompany the cortege, in\nattendance upon madame Wang, and gave her mind furthermore to finding a\nplace where she herself could put up in at the time of the funeral.\nAbout this very time, it happened that the consort of the Duke Shan Kuo\ndeparted this life, and that mesdames Wang and Hsing had likewise to go\nand offer sacrifices, and to follow the burial procession; that the\nbirthday occurred of the consort of Prince Hsi An; that presents had to\nbe forwarded on the occasion of this anniversary; and that the consort\nof the Duke of Chen Kuo gave birth to a first child, a son, and\ncongratulatory gifts had, in like manner, to be provided. Besides, her\nuterine brother Wang Jen was about to return south, with all his family,\nand she had too to write her home letters, to send her reverent\ncompliments to her father and mother, as well as to get the things ready\nthat were to be taken along. There was also Ying Ch’un, who had\ncontracted some illness, and the doctor had every day to be sent for,\nand medicines to be administered, the notes of the doctor to be looked\nafter, consisting of the bulletins of the diagnosis and the\nprescriptions, with the result that the various things that had to be\nattended to by lady Feng were so manifold that it would, indeed, be\ndifficult to give an exhaustive idea of them.",
        "In addition to all this, the day for taking the coffin away was close at\nhand, so that lady Feng was so hard pressed for time that she had even\nno desire for any tea to drink or anything to eat, and that she could\nnot sit or rest in peace. As soon as she put her foot into the Ning\nmansion, the inmates of the Jung mansion would follow close upon her\nheels; and the moment she got back into the Jung mansion, the servants\nagain of the Ning mansion would follow her about. In spite however of\nthis great pressure, lady Feng, whose natural disposition had ever been\nto try and excel, was urged to strain the least of her energies, as her\nsole dread was lest she should incur unfavourable criticism from any\none; and so excellent were the plans she devised, that every one in the\nclan, whether high or low, readily conceded her unlimited praise.",
        "On the night of this day, the body had to be watched, and in the inner\nsuite of apartments two companies of young players as well as jugglers\nentertained the relatives, friends and other visitors during the whole\nof the night. Mrs. Yu was still laid up in the inside room, so that the\nwhole task of attending to and entertaining the company devolved upon\r\nlady Feng alone, who had to look after everything; for though there\nwere, in the whole clan, many sisters-in-law, some there were too\nbashful to speak, others too timid to stand on their feet; while there\nwere also those who were not accustomed to meeting company; and those\nlikewise who were afraid of people of high estate and shy of officials.\nOf every kind there were, but the whole number of them could not come up\nto lady Feng’s standard, whose deportment was correct and whose speech\nwas according to rule. Hence it was that she did not even so much as\nheed any of that large company, but gave directions and issued orders,\nadopting any course of action which she fancied, just as if there were\nno bystander.",
        "The whole night, the lanterns emitted a bright light and the fires\nbrilliant rays; while guests were escorted on their way out and\nofficials greeted on their way in; but of this hundredfold bustle and\nstir nothing need, of course, be said.",
        "The next morning at the dawn of day, and at a propitious moment,\nsixty-four persons, dressed all alike in blue, carried the coffin,\npreceded by a streamer with the record in large characters: Coffin of\nlady Ch’in, a lady of the fifth degree, (by marriage) of the Chia\nmansion, deceased at middle age, consort of the grandson of the Ning Kuo\nDuke with the first rank title of honour, (whose status is) a guard of\nthe Imperial antechamber, charged with the protection of the Inner\nPalace and Roads in the Red Prohibited City.",
        "The various paraphernalia and ornaments were all brand-new, hurriedly\nmade for the present occasion, and the uniform lustrous brilliancy they\nshed was sufficient to dazzle the eyes.",
        "Pao-chu, of course, observed the rites prescribed for unmarried\ndaughters, and dashed the bowl and walked by the coffin, as she gave way\nto most bitter lamentations.",
        "At that time, among the officials who escorted the funeral procession,\nwere Niu Chi-tsung, the grandson of the Chen Kuo duke, who had now\ninherited the status of earl of the first degree; Liu Fang, the grandson\nof Liu Piao, duke of Li Kuo, who had recently inherited the rank of\nviscount of the first class; Ch’en Jui-wen, a grandson of Ch’en Yi, duke\nof Ch’i Kuo, who held the hereditary rank of general of the third\ndegree, with the prefix of majestic authority; Ma Shang, the grandson of\nMa K’uei, duke of Chih Kuo, by inheritance general of the third rank\nwith the prefix of majesty afar; Hou Hsiao-keng, an hereditary viscount\nof the first degree, grandson of the duke of Hsiu Kuo, Hou Hsiao-ming by\nname; while the death of the consort of the duke of Shan Kuo had obliged\nhis grandson Shih Kuang-chu to go into mourning so that he could not be\npresent. These were the six families which had, along with the two\nhouseholds of Jung and Ning, been, at one time, designated the eight\ndukes.",
        "Among the rest, there were besides the grandson of the Prince of Nan An;\nthe grandson of the Prince of Hsi An; Shih Ting, marquis of Chung Ching;\nChiang Tzu-ning, an hereditary baron of the second grade, grandson of\nthe earl of P’ing Yuan; Hsieh K’un, an hereditary baron of the second\norder and Captain of the Metropolitan camp, grandson of the marquis of\nTing Ch’ang: Hsi Chien-hui, an hereditary baron of the second rank, a\ngrandson of the marquis of Nang Yang; Ch’in Liang, in command of the\nFive Cities, grandson of the marquis of Ching T’ien. The remainder were\nWei Chi, the son of the earl of Chin Hsiang; Feng Tzu-ying, the son of a\ngeneral, whose prefix was supernatural martial spirit; Ch’en Yeh-chün,\nWei Jo-lan and others, grandsons and sons of princes who could not be\nenumerated.",
        "In the way of ladies, there were also in all about ten large official\nsedan chairs full of them, thirty or forty private chairs, and including\nthe official and non-official chairs, and carriages containing inmates\nof the household, there must have been over a hundred and ten; so that\nwith the various kinds of paraphernalia, articles of decoration and\nhundreds of nick-nacks, which preceded, the vast expanse of the cortege\ncovered a continuous line extending over three or four li.",
        "They had not been very long on their way, when they reached variegated\nsheds soaring high by the roadside, in which banquets were spread,\nfeasts laid out, and music discoursed in unison. These were the viatory\nsacrificial offerings contributed by the respective families. The first\nshed contained the sacrificial donations of the mansion of the Prince of\nTung P’ing; the second shed those of the Prince of Nan An; the third\nthose of the Prince of Hsi Ning, and the fourth those of the Prince of\nPei Ching.",
        "Indeed of these four Princes, the reputation enjoyed in former days by\nthe Prince of Pei Ching had been the most exalted, and to this day his\nsons and grandsons still succeeded to the inheritance of the princely\ndignity. The present incumbent of the Princedom of Pei Ching, Shih Jung,\nhad not as yet come of age, but he was gifted with a presence of\nexceptional beauty, and with a disposition condescending and genial. At\nthe demise, recently, of the consort of the eldest grandson of the\nmansion of Ning Kuo, he, in consideration of the friendship which had\nformerly existed between the two grandfathers, by virtue of which they\nhad been inseparable, both in adversity as well as in prosperity,\ntreating each other as if they had not been of different surnames, was\nconsequently induced to pay no regard to princely dignity or to his\nimportance, but having like the others paid, on the previous day, his\ncondolences and presented sacrificial offerings, he had further now\nraised a shed wherein to offer libations. Having directed every one of\nhis subordinate officers to remain in this spot in attendance, he\nhimself went at the fifth watch to court, and when he acquitted himself\nof his public duties he forthwith changed his attire for a mourning\ncostume, and came along, in an official sedan chair, preceded by gongs\nand umbrellas. Upon reaching the front of the shed the chair was\ndeposited on the ground, and as his subordinate officers pressed on\neither side and waited upon him, neither the military nor the populace,\nwhich composed the mass of people, ventured to make any commotion. In a\nshort while, the long procession of the Ning mansion became visible,\nspreading far and wide, covering in its course from the north, the whole\nground like a silver mountain. At an early hour, the forerunners,\nmessengers and other attendants on the staff of the Ning mansion\napprised Chia Chen (of the presence of the sheds), and Chia Chen with\nall alacrity gave orders that the foremost part of the cortege should\nhalt. Attended by Chia She and Chia Chen, the three of them came with\nhurried step to greet (the Prince of Pei Ching), whom they saluted with\ndue ceremony. Shih Jung, who was seated in his sedan chair, made a bow\nand returned their salutations with a smile, proceeding to address them\nand to treat them, as he had done hitherto, as old friends, without any\nairs of self-importance.",
        "“My daughter’s funeral has,” observed Chia Chen, “put your Highness to\nthe trouble of coming, an honour which we, though noble by birth, do not\ndeserve.”",
        "Shih Jung smiled. “With the terms of friendship,” he added, “which have\nexisted for so many generations (between our families), is there any\nneed for such apologies?”",
        "Turning his head round there and then, he gave directions to the senior\nofficer of his household to preside at the sacrifices and to offer\nlibations in his stead; and Chia She and the others stood together on\none side and made obeisance in return, and then came in person again and\ngave expression to their gratitude for his bounty.",
        "Shih Jung was most affable and complaisant. “Which is the gentleman,” he\ninquired of Chia Chen, “who was born with a piece of jade in his mouth?\nI’ve long had a wish to have the pleasure of seeing him, and as he’s\nsure to be on the spot on an occasion like this, why shouldn’t you\ninvite him to come round?”",
        "Chia Chen speedily drew back, and bidding Pao-yü change his mourning\nclothes, he led him forward and presented him.",
        "Pao-yü had all along heard that Shih Jung was a worthy Prince, perfect\nin ability as well as in appearance, pleasant and courteous, not bound\ndown by any official custom or state rite, so that he had repeatedly\nfelt a keen desire to meet him. With the sharp control, however, which\nhis father exercised over him, he had not been able to gratify his wish.\nBut on this occasion, he saw on the contrary that he came to call him,\nand it was but natural that he should be delighted. Whilst advancing, he\nscrutinised Shih Jung with the corner of his eye, who, seated as he was\nin the sedan chair, presented an imposing sight.",
        "But, reader, what occurred on his approach is not yet known, but listen\nto the next chapter, which will divulge it.",
        "  Lady Peng, née Wang, exercises her authority in the Iron Fence Temple.\n  Ch’in Ching-ch’ing (Ch’ing Chung) amuses himself in the Man-t’ou\n      (Bread) nunnery.",
        "But we shall now resume our story. When Pao-yü raised his eyes, he\nnoticed that Shih Jung, Prince of Pei Ching, wore on his head a princely\ncap with pure white tassels and silvery feathers, that he was appareled\nin a white ceremonial robe, (with a pattern representing) the toothlike\nripple of a river and the waters of the sea, embroidered with\nfive-clawed dragons; and that he was girded with a red leather belt,\ninlaid with white jade. That his face was like a beauteous gem; that his\neyes were like sparkling stars; and that he was, in very truth, a human\nbeing full of graceful charms.",
        "Pao-yü hastily pressed forward and made a reverent obeisance, and Shih\nJung lost no time in extending his arms from inside the sedan-chair, and\nembracing him. At a glance, he saw that Pao-yü had on his head a silver\ncap, to which the hair was attached, that he had, round his forehead, a\nflap on which were embroidered a couple of dragons issuing from the sea,\nthat he wore a white archery-sleeved robe, ornamented with dragons, and\nthat his waist was encircled by a silver belt, inlaid with pearls; that\nhis face resembled vernal flowers and that his eyes were like drops of\nlacquer.",
        "Shih Jung smiled. “Your name is,” he said, “no trumped-up story; for\nyou, verily, resemble a precious gem; but where’s the valuable trinket\nyou had in your mouth?” he inquired.",
        "As soon as Pao-yü heard this inquiry, he hastened to produce the jade\nfrom inside his clothes and to hand it over to Shih Jung. Shih Jung\nminutely examined it; and having also read the motto on it, he\nconsequently ascertained whether it was really efficacious or not.",
        "“It’s true that it’s said to be,” Pao-yü promptly explained, “but it\nhasn’t yet been put to the test.”",
        "Shih Jung extolled it with unbounded praise, and, as he did so, he set\nthe variegated tassels in proper order, and, with his own hands,\nattached it on to Pao-yü’s neck. Taking also his hand in his, he\ninquired of Pao-yü what was his age? and what books he was reading at\npresent, to each of which questions Pao-yü gave suitable answer.",
        "Shih Jung perceiving the perspicacity of his speech and the propriety of\nhis utterances, simultaneously turned towards Chia Chen and observed\nwith a smile on his face: “Your worthy son is, in very truth, like the\nyoung of a dragon or like the nestling of a phoenix! and this isn’t an\nidle compliment which I, a despicable prince, utter in your venerable\npresence! But how much more glorious will be, in the future, the voice\nof the young phoenix than that of the old phoenix, it isn’t easy to\nascertain.”",
        "Chia Chen forced a smile: “My cur-like son,” he replied, “cannot presume\nto such bountiful praise and golden commendation; but if, by the virtue\nof your Highness’ excess of happiness, he does indeed realise your\nwords, he will be a source of joy to us all!”",
        "“There’s one thing, however,” continued Shih Jung; “with the excellent\nabilities which your worthy scion possesses, he’s sure, I presume, to be\nextremely loved by her dowager ladyship, (his grandmother), and by all\nclasses. But for young men of our age it’s a great drawback to be doated\nupon, for with over-fondness, we cannot help utterly frustrating the\nbenefits of education. When I, a despicable prince, was young, I walked\nin this very track, and I presume that your honourable son cannot\nlikewise but do the same. By remaining at home, your worthy scion will\nfind it difficult to devote his attention to study; and he will not reap\nany harm, were he to come, at frequent intervals, to my humble home; for\nthough my deserts be small, I nevertheless enjoy the great honour of the\nacquaintance of all the scholars of note in the Empire, so that,\nwhenever any of them visit the capital, not one of them is there who\ndoes not lower his blue eyes upon me. Hence it is that in my mean abode,\neminent worthies rendezvous; and were your esteemed son to come, as\noften as he can, and converse with them and meet them, his knowledge\nwould, in that case, have every opportunity of making daily strides\ntowards improvement.”",
        "Chia Chen speedily bent his body and expressed his acquiescence, by way\nof reply; whereupon Shih Jung went further, and taking off from his\nwrist a chaplet of pearls, he presented it to Pao-yü.",
        "“This is the first time we meet,” he observed. “Our meeting was so\nunexpected that I have no suitable congratulatory present to offer you.\nThis was conferred upon me by His Majesty, and is a string of\nchaplet-pearls, scented with Ling Ling, which will serve as a temporary\ntoken of respectful congratulations.”",
        "Pao-yü hastened to receive it from his hands, and turning round, he\nreverently presented it to Chia Chen. Chia Chen and Pao-yü jointly\nreturned thanks; and forthwith Chia She, Chia Chen and the rest came\nforward in a body, and requested the Prince to turn his chair homewards.",
        "“The departed,” expostulated Shih Jung, “has already ascended the\nspiritual regions, and is no more a mortal being in this dusty world\nexposed to vicissitude like you and I. Although a mean prince like me\nhas been the recipient of the favour of the Emperor, and has\nundeservedly been called to the princely inheritance, how could I\npresume to go before the spiritual hearse and return home?”",
        "Chia She and the others, perceiving how persistent he was in his refusal\nhad no course but to take their leave, express their sense of gratitude\nand to rejoin the cortege. They issued orders to their servants to stop\nthe band, and to hush the music, and making the procession go by, they\nat length left the way clear for Shih Jung to prosecute his way.",
        "But we will now leave him and resume our account of the funeral of the\nNing mansion. All along its course the road was plunged in unusual\ncommotion. As soon as they reached the city gates Chia She, Chia Cheng,\nChia Chen, and the others again received donations from all their fellow\nofficers and subordinates, in sacrificial sheds erected by their\nrespective families, and after they returned thanks to one after\nanother, they eventually issued from the city walls, and proceeded\neventually along the highway, in the direction of the Temple of the Iron\nFence.",
        "Chia Chen, at this time, went, together with Chia Jung, up to all their\nseniors, and pressed them to get into their sedan chairs, and to ride\ntheir horses; and Chia She and all of the same age as himself were\nconsequently induced to mount into their respective carriages or chairs.\nChia Chen and those of the same generation were likewise about to ride\ntheir horses, when lady Feng, through her solicitude on Pao-yü’s\naccount, gave way to fears lest now that they had reached the open\ncountry, he should do as he pleased, and not listen to the words of any\nof the household, and lest Chia Chen should not be able to keep him in\ncheck; and, as she dreaded that he might go astray, she felt compelled\nto bid a youth call him to her; and Pao-yü had no help but to appear\nbefore her curricle.",
        "“My dear brother,” lady Feng remarked smiling, “you are a respectable\nperson, and like a girl in your ways, and shouldn’t imitate those\nmonkeys on horseback! do get down and let both you and I sit together in\nthis carriage; and won’t that be nice?”",
        "At these words, Pao-yü readily dismounted and climbed up into the\ncarriage occupied by lady Feng; and they both talked and laughed, as\nthey continued their way.",
        "But not a long time elapsed before two men, on horseback, were seen\napproaching from the opposite direction. Coming straight up to lady\nFeng’s vehicle they dismounted, and said, as they leaned on the sides of\nher carriage, “There’s a halting place here, and will it not please your\nladyship to have a rest and change?”",
        "Lady Feng directed them to ask the two ladies Hsing and Wang what they\nwould like to do, and the two men explained: “These ladies have\nsignified that they had no desire to rest, and they wish your ladyship\nto suit your convenience.”",
        "Lady Feng speedily issued orders that they should have a rest, before\nthey prosecuted their way, and the servant youth led the harnessed\nhorses through the crowd of people and came towards the north, while\nPao-yü, from inside the carriage, urgently asked that Mr. Ch’in should\nbe requested to come.",
        "Ch’in Chung was at this moment on horseback following in the track of\nhis father’s carriage, when unexpectedly he caught sight of Pao-yü’s\npage, come at a running pace and invite him to have some refreshment.\nCh’in Chung perceived from a distance that the horse, which Pao-yü had\nbeen riding, walked behind lady Feng’s vehicle, as it went towards the\nnorth, with its saddle and bridles all piled up, and readily concluding\nthat Pao-yü must be in the same carriage with that lady, he too turned\nhis horse and came over in haste and entered, in their company, the door\nof a farm-house.",
        "This dwelling of the farmer’s did not contain many rooms so that the\nwomen and girls had nowhere to get out of the way; and when the village\nlasses and country women perceived the bearing and costumes of lady\nFeng, Pao-yü, and Ch’in Chung, they were inclined to suspect that\ncelestial beings had descended into the world.",
        "Lady Feng entered a thatched house, and, in the first place, asked\nPao-yü and the rest to go out and play. Pao-yü took the hint, and, along\nwith Ch’in Chung, he led off the servant boys and went to romp all over\nthe place.",
        "The various articles in use among the farmers they had not seen before,\nwith the result that after Pao-yü had inspected them, he thought them\nall very strange; but he could neither make out their names nor their\nuses. But among the servant boys, there were those who knew, and they\nexplained to them, one after another, what they were called, as well as\nwhat they were for. As Pao-yü, after this explanation, nodded his head;\n\"It isn’t strange,” he said, “that an old writer has this line in his\npoetical works, ’Who can realise that the food in a bowl is, grain by\ngrain, all the fruit of labour.’ This is indeed so!” As he spoke, they\nhad come into another house; and at the sight of a spinning wheel on a\nstove-bed, they thought it still more strange and wonderful, but the\nservant boys again told them that it was used for spinning the yarn to\nweave cloth with, and Pao-yü speedily jumping on to the stove-bed, set\nto work turning the wheel for the sake of fun, when a village lass of\nabout seventeen or eighteen years of age came forward, and asked them\nnot to meddle with it and spoil it.",
        "The servant boys promptly stopped her interference; but Pao-yü himself\ndesisted, as he added: “It’s because I hadn’t seen one before that I\ncame to try it for fun.”",
        "“You people can’t do it,” rejoined the lass, “let me turn it for you to\nsee.”",
        "Ch’in Chung secretly pulled Pao-yü and remarked, “It’s great fun in this\nvillage!” but Pao-yü gave him a nudge and observed, “If you talk\nnonsense again, I’ll beat you.” Watching intently, as he uttered these\nwords, the village girl who started reeling the thread, and presented,\nin very truth, a pretty sight. But suddenly an old woman from the other\nside gave a shout. “My girl Secunda, come over at once;” and the lass\ndiscarded the spinning-wheel and hastily went on her way.",
        "Pao-yü was the while feeling disappointed and unhappy, when he espied a\nservant, whom lady Feng had sent, come and call them both in. Lady Feng\nhad washed her hands and changed her costume; and asked him whether he\nwould change or not, and Pao-yü, having replied “No! it doesn’t matter\nafter all if I don’t change,” the female attendants served tea, cakes\nand fruits and also poured the scented tea. Lady Feng and the others\ndrank their tea, and waiting until they had put the various articles by,\nand made all the preparations, they promptly started to get into their\ncarriages. Outside, Wang Erh had got ready tips and gave them to the\npeople of the farm, and the farm women and all the inmates went up to\nthem to express their gratitude; but when Pao-yü came to look carefully,\nhe failed to see anything of the lass who had reeled the thread. But\nthey had not gone far before they caught sight of this girl Secunda\ncoming along with a small child in her arms, who, they concluded, was\nher young brother, laughing and chatting, in company with a few young\ngirls.",
        "Pao-yü could not suppress the voice of love, but being seated in the\ncarriage, he was compelled to satisfy himself by following her with his\neyes. Soon however the vehicle sped on as rapidly as a cloud impelled by\nthe wind, so that when he turned his head round, there was already no\nvestige to be seen of her; but, while they were bandying words, they had\nunexpectedly overtaken the great concourse of the cortege.",
        "Likewise, at an early stage men were stationed ahead, with Buddhist\ndrums and gold cymbals, with streamers, and jewelled coverings; and the\nwhole company of bonzes, belonging to the Iron Fence Temple, had already\nbeen drawn out in a line by the sides of the road. In a short while,\nthey reached the interior of the temple, where additional sacrifices\nwere offered and Buddhistic services performed; and where altars had\nagain been erected to burn incense on. The coffin was deposited in a\nside room of the inner court; and Pao Chu got ready a bed-room in which\nshe could keep her watch.",
        "In the outer apartments, Chia Chen did the honours among the whole party\nof relatives and friends, some of whom asked to be allowed to stay for\ntheir meals, while others at this stage took their leave. And after they\nhad one by one returned thanks, the dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts\nand barons, each in respective batches, (got up to go,) and they kept on\nleaving from between 1 and 3 p.m. before they had finally all dispersed.",
        "In the inner Chambers, the ladies were solely entertained and attended\nto by lady Feng. First to make a move were the consorts of officials;\nand noon had also come, by the time the whole party of them had taken\ntheir departure. Those that remained were simply a few relatives of the\nsame clan and others like them, who eventually left after the completion\nof the three days’ rationalistic liturgies.",
        "The two ladies Hsing and Wang, well aware at this time that lady Feng\ncould on no account return home, desired to enter the city at once; and\nmadame Wang wanted to take Pao-yü home; but Pao-yü, who had, on an\nunexpected occasion, come out into the country, entertained, of course,\nno wish to go back; and he would agree to nothing else than to stay\nbehind with lady Feng, so that madame Wang had no alternative but to\nhand him over to her charge and to start.",
        "This Temple of the Iron Fence had, in fact, been erected in days gone\nby, at the expense of the two dukes Ning and Jung; and there still\nremained up to these days, acres of land, from which were derived the\nfunds for incense and lights for such occasions, on which the coffins of\nany members, old or young, (who died) in the capital, had to be\ndeposited in this temple; and the inner and outer houses, in this\ncompound were all kept in readiness and good order, for the\naccommodation of those who formed part of the cortège.",
        "At this time, as it happened, the descendants mustered an immense crowd,\nand among them were poor and rich of various degrees, or with likes and\ndislikes diametrically opposed. There were those, who, being in\nstraitened circumstances at home, and easily contented, readily took up\ntheir quarters in the temple. And there were those with money and\nposition, and with extravagant ideas, who maintained that the\naccommodation in the temple was not suitable, and, of course, went in\nsearch of additional quarters, either in country houses, or in convents,\nwhere they could have their meals and retire, after the ceremonies were\nover.",
        "On the occasion of Mrs. Ch’in’s funeral, all the members of the clan put\nup temporarily in the Iron Fence Temple; lady Feng alone looked down\nupon it as inconvenient, and consequently despatched a servant to go and\ntell Ch’ing Hsü, a nun in the Bread Convent, to empty two rooms for her\nto go and live in.",
        "This Bread Convent had at one time been styled the Shui Yueh nunnery\n(water moon); but as good bread was made in that temple, it gave rise to\nthis nickname.",
        "This convent was not very distant from the Temple of the Iron Fence, so\nthat as soon as the bonzes brought their functions to a close, and the\nsacrifice of evening was offered, Chia Chen asked Chia Jung to request\nlady Feng to retire to rest; and as lady Feng perceived that there still\nremained several sisters-in-law to keep company to the female relatives,\nshe readily, of her own accord, took leave of the whole party, and,\nalong with Pao-yü and Ch’in Chung, came to the Water Moon Convent.",
        "Ch’in Yeh, it must be noticed, was advanced in years and a victim to\nmany ailments, so that he was unable to remain in the temple long, and\nhe bade Ch’in Chung tarry until the coffin had been set in its resting\nplace, with the result that Ch’in Chung came along, at the same time as\nlady Feng and Pao-yü, to the Water Moon Convent, where Ch’ing Hsü\nappeared, together with two neophytes, Chih Shan and Chih Neng, to\nreceive them. After they had exchanged greetings, lady Feng and the\nothers entered the “chaste” apartments to change their clothes and wash\ntheir hands; and when they had done, as she perceived how much taller in\nstature Chih Neng had grown and how much handsomer were her features,\nshe felt prompted to inquire, “How is it that your prioress and\nyourselves haven’t been all these days as far as our place?”",
        "“It’s because during these days we haven’t had any time which we could\ncall our own,” explained Ch’ing Hsü. “Owing to the birth of a son in Mr.\nHu’s mansion, dame Hu sent over about ten taels and asked that we should\ninvite several head-nuns to read during three days the service for the\nchurching of women, with the result that we’ve been so very busy and had\nso little leisure, that we couldn’t come over to pay our respects to\nyour ladyship.”",
        "But leaving aside the old nun, who kept lady Feng company, we will now\nreturn to the two lads Pao-yü and Ch’in Chung. They were up to their\npranks in the main building of the convent, when seeing Chih Neng come\nover: “Here’s Neng Erh,” Pao-yü exclaimed with a smile.",
        "“Why notice a creature like her?” remarked Ch’in Chung; to which Pao-yü\nrejoined laughingly: “Don’t be sly! why then did you the other day, when\nyou were in the old lady’s rooms, and there was not a soul present, hold\nher in your arms? and do you want to fool me now ?”",
        "“There was nothing of the kind,” observed Ch’in Chung smiling.",
        "“Whether there was or not,” replied Pao-yü, “doesn’t concern me; but if\nyou will stop her and tell her to pour a cup of tea and bring it to me\nto drink, I’ll then keep hands off.”",
        "“This is indeed very strange!” Ch’in Chung answered laughing; “do you\nfear that if you told her to pour you one, that she wouldn’t; and what\nneed is there that I should tell her?”",
        "“If I ask her,” Pao-yü observed, “to pour it, she wouldn’t be as ready\nas she would were you to tell her about it.”",
        "Ch’in Chung had no help but to speak. “Neng Erh!” he said, “bring a cup\nof tea.”",
        "This Neng Erh had, since her youth, been in and out of the Jung mansion,\nso that there was no one that she did not know; and she had also, time\nafter time, romped and laughed with Pao-yü and Ch’in Chung. Being now\ngrown up she gradually came to know the import of love, and she readily\ntook a fancy to Ch’in Chung, who was an amorous being. Ch’in Chung too\nreturned her affection, on account of her good looks; and, although he\nand she had not had any very affectionate tête-à-têtes, they had,\nhowever, long ago come to understand each other’s feelings and wishes.",
        "Chih Neng walked away and returned after having poured the tea.",
        "“Give it to me,” Ch’in Chung cried out smirkingly; while Pao-yü likewise\nshouted: “Give it to me.”",
        "Chih Neng compressed her lips and sneeringly rejoined, “Are you going to\nhave a fight even over a cup of tea? Is it forsooth likely that there’s\nhoney in my hand?”",
        "Pao-yü was the first to grasp and take over the cup, but while drinking\nit, he was about to make some inquiry, when he caught sight of Chih\nShan, who came and called Chih Neng away to go and lay the plates with\nfruit on the table. Not much time elapsed before she came round to\nrequest the two lads to go and have tea and refreshments; but would they\neat such things as were laid before them? They simply sat for a while\nand came out again and resumed their play.",
        "Lady Feng too stayed for a few moments, and then returned, with the old\nnun as her escort, into the “unsullied” rooms to lie down. By this time,\nall the matrons and married women discovered that there was nothing else\nto be done, and they dispersed in succession, retiring each to rest.\nThere only remained in attendance several young girls who enjoyed her\nconfidence, and the old nun speedily availed herself of the opportunity\nto speak. “I’ve got something,” she said, “about which I mean to go to\nyour mansion to beg of madame Wang; but I’ll first request you, my lady,\nto tell me how to set to work.”",
        "“What’s it?” ascertained lady Feng.",
        "“O-mi-to-fu!” exclaimed the old nun, “It’s this; in days gone by, I\nfirst lived in the Ch’ang An district. When I became a nun and entered\nthe monastery of Excellent Merit, there lived, at that time, a\nsubscriber, Chang by surname, a very wealthy man. He had a daughter,\nwhose infant name was Chin Ko; the whole family came in the course of\nthat year to the convent I was in, to offer incense, and as luck would\nhave it they met Li Ya-nei, a brother of a secondary wife of the Prefect\nof the Ch’ang An Prefecture. This Li Ya-nei fell in love at first sight\nwith her, and would wed Chin Ko as his wife. He sent go-betweens to ask\nher in marriage, but, contrary to his expectations, Chin Ko had already\nreceived the engagement presents of the son of the ex-Major of the\nCh’ang An Prefecture. The Chang family, on the other hand, were afraid\nthat if they withdrew from the match, the Major would not give up his\nclaim, and they therefore replied that she was already promised to\nanother. But, who would have thought it, this Mr. Li was seriously bent\nupon marrying the young lady. But while the Chang family were at a loss\nwhat plan to devise, and both parties were in a dilemma, the family of\nthe Major came unexpectedly to hear of the news; and without even\nlooking thoroughly into the matter, they there and then had recourse to\ninsult and abuse. ’Is a girl,’ they insinuated, ’to be promised to the\nsons of several families!’ And obstinately refusing to allow the\nrestitution of the betrothal presents, they at once had recourse to\nlitigation and brought an action (against the girl’s people.) That\nfamily was at their wits’ end, and had no alternative but to find some\none to go to the capital to obtain means of assistance; and, losing all\npatience, they insisted upon the return of the presents. I believe that\nthe present commander of the troops at Ch’ang An, Mr. Yün, is on\nfriendly terms with your honourable family, and could one solicit madame\nWang to put in a word with Mr. Chia Cheng to send a letter and ask Mr.\nYün to speak to that Major, I have no fear that he will not agree.\nShould (your ladyship) be willing to take action, the Chang family are\neven ready to present all they have, though it may entail the ruin of\ntheir estate.”",
        "“This affair is, it’s true, of no great moment,” lady Feng replied\nsmiling, after hearing this appeal; “but the only thing is that madame\nWang does no longer attend to matters of this nature.”",
        "“If madame doesn’t heed them,” suggested the old nun, “you, my lady, can\nsafely assume the direction.”",
        "“I’m neither in need of any money to spend,” added lady Feng with a\nsmirk, “nor do I undertake such matters!”",
        "These words did not escape Ching Hsü’s ear; they scattered to the winds\nher vain hopes. After a minute or so she heaved a sigh.",
        "“What you say may be true enough,” she remarked; “but the Chang family\nare also aware that I mean to come and make my appeal to your mansion;\nand were you now not to manage this affair, the Chang family having no\nidea that the lack of time prevents any steps being taken and that no\nimportance is attached to their presents, it will appear, on the\ncontrary, as if there were not even this little particle of skill in\nyour household.”",
        "At these words lady Feng felt at once inspirited. “You’ve known of old,\"\nshe added, “that I’ve never had any faith in anything concerning\nretribution in the Court of Judgment in the unseen or in hell; and that\nwhatever I say that I shall do, that I do; tell them therefore to bring\nthree thousand taels; and I shall then remedy this grievance of theirs.”",
        "The old nun upon hearing this remark was so exceedingly delighted, that\nshe precipitately exclaimed, “They’ve got it, they’ve got it! there will\nbe no difficulty about it.”",
        "“I’m not,” lady Feng went on to add, “like those people, who afford help\nand render assistance with an eye to money; these three thousand taels\nwill be exclusively devoted for the travelling expenses of those youths,\nwho will be sent to deliver messages and for them to make a few cash for\ntheir trouble; but as for me I don’t want even so much as a cash. In\nfact I’m able at this very moment to produce as much as thirty thousand\ntaels.”",
        "The old nun assented with alacrity, and said by way of reply, “If that\nbe so, my lady, do display your charitable bounty at once to-morrow and\nbring things to an end.”",
        "“Just see,” remarked lady Feng, “how hard pressed I am; which place can\ndo without me? but since I’ve given you my word, I shall, needless to\nsay, speedily bring the matter to a close.”",
        "“A small trifle like this,” hinted the old nun, “would, if placed in the\nhands of any one else, flurry her to such an extent that she would be\nquite at a loss what to do; but in your hands, my lady, even if much\nmore were superadded, it wouldn’t require as much exertion as a wave of\nyour hand. But the proverb well says: ’that those who are able have much\nto do;’ for madame Wang, seeing that your ladyship manages all concerns,\nwhether large or small, properly, has still more shoved the burden of\neverything on your shoulders, my lady; but you should, it’s but right,\nalso take good care of your precious health.”",
        "This string of flattery pleased lady Feng more and more, so that\nheedless of fatigue she went on to chat with still greater zest.",
        "But, thing unthought of, Ch’in Chung availed himself of the darkness, as\nwell as of the absence of any one about, to come in quest of Chih Neng.\nAs soon as he reached the room at the back, he espied Chih Neng all\nalone inside washing the tea cups; and Ch’in Chung forthwith seized her\nin his arms and implanted kisses on her cheek. Chih Neng got in a\ndreadful state, and stamping her feet, cried, “What are you up to?” and\nshe was just on the point of shouting out, when Ch’in Chung rejoined:\n\"My dear girl! I’m nearly dead from impatience, and if you don’t again\nto-day accept my advances, I shall this very moment die on this spot.”",
        "“What you’re bent upon,” added Chih Neng, “can’t be effected; not unless\nyou wait until I’ve left this den and parted company from these people,\nwhen it will be safe enough.”",
        "“This is of course easy enough!” remonstrated Ch’in Chung; “but the\ndistant water cannot extinguish the close fire!”",
        "As he spoke, with one puff, he put out the light, plunging the whole\nroom in pitch darkness; and seizing Chih Neng, he pushed her on to the\nstove-couch and started a violent love affair. Chih Neng could not,\nthough she strained every nerve, escape his importunities; nor could she\nvery well shout, so that she felt compelled to humour him; but while he\nwas in the midst of his ecstatic joy, they perceived a person walk in,\nwho pressed both of them down, without uttering even so much as a sound,\nand plunged them both in such a fright that their very souls flew away\nand their spirits wandered from their bodies; and it was after the third\nparty had burst out laughing with a spurting sound that they eventually\nbecame aware that it was Pao-yü; when, springing to his feet\nimpetuously, Ch’in Chung exclaimed full of resentment, “What’s this that\nyou’re up to!”",
        "“If you get your monkey up,” retorted Pao-yü, “why, then let you and I\nstart bawling out;” which so abashed Chih Neng that she availed herself\nof the gloomy light to make her escape; while Pao-yü had dragged Ch’in\nChung out of the room and asked, “Now then, do you still want to play\nthe bully!”",
        "“My dear fellow,” pleaded Ch’in Chung smilingly, “whatever you do don’t\nshout out and let every one know; and all you want, I’ll agree to.”",
        "“We needn’t argue just now,” Pao-yü observed with a grin; “wait a while,\nand when all have gone to sleep, we can minutely settle accounts\ntogether.”",
        "Soon it was time to ease their clothes, and go to bed; and lady Feng\noccupied the inner room; Ch’in Chung and Pao-yü the outer; while the\nwhole ground was covered with matrons of the household, who had spread\ntheir bedding, and sat watching. As lady Feng entertained fears that the\njade of Spiritual Perception might be lost, she waited until Pao-yü fell\nasleep, when having directed a servant to bring it to her, she placed it\nunder the side of her own pillow.",
        "What accounts Pao-yü settled with Ch’in Chung cannot be ascertained; and\nas in the absence of any positive proof what is known is based upon\nsurmises, we shall not venture to place it on record.",
        "Nothing worth noticing occurred the whole night; but the next day, as\nsoon as the morning dawned, dowager lady Chia and madame Wang promptly\ndespatched servants to come and see how Pao-yü was getting on; and to\ntell him likewise to put on two pieces of extra clothing, and that if\nthere was nothing to be done it would be better for him to go back.",
        "But was it likely that Pao-yü would be willing to go back? Besides Ch’in\nChung, in his inordinate passion for Chih Neng, instigated Pao-yü to\nentreat lady Feng to remain another day. Lady Feng pondered in her own\nmind that, although the most important matters connected with the\nfuneral ceremonies had been settled satisfactorily, there were still a\nfew minor details, for which no provision had been made, so that could\nshe avail herself of this excuse to remain another day would she not win\nfrom Chia Chen a greater degree of approbation, in the second place,\nwould she not be able further to bring Ch’ing Hsü’s business to an\nissue, and, in the third place, to humour Pao-yü’s wish? In view of\nthese three advantages, which would accrue, “All that I had to do, I\nhave done,” she readily signified to Pao-yü, “and if you be bent upon\nrunning about in here, you’ll unavoidably place me in still greater\ntrouble; so that we must for certain start homewards to-morrow.”",
        "“My dear cousin, my own dear cousin,” urgently entreated Pao-yü, when he\nheard these words, “let’s stay only this one day, and to-morrow we can\ngo back without fail.”",
        "They actually spent another night there, and lady Feng availed herself\nof their stay to give directions that the case which had been entrusted\nto her the previous day by the old nun should be secretly communicated\nto Lai Wang Erh. Lai Wang’s mind grasped the import of all that was said\nto him, and, having entered the city with all despatch, he went in\nsearch of the gentleman, who acted as secretary (in Mr. Yün’s office),\npretending that he had been directed by Mr. Chia Lien to come and ask\nhim to write a letter and to send it that very night to the Ch’ang An\nmagistrate. The distance amounted to no more than one hundred li, so\nthat in the space of two days everything was brought to a satisfactory\nsettlement. The general, whose name was Yün Kuang, had been for a long\ntime under obligations to the Chia family, so that he naturally could\nnot refuse his co-operation in such small trifles. When he had handed\nhis reply, Wang Erh started on his way back; where we shall leave him\nand return to lady Feng.",
        "Having spent another day, she on the morrow took leave of the old nun,\nwhom she advised to come to the mansion after the expiry of three days\nto fetch a reply.",
        "Ch’in Chung and Chih Neng could not, by any means, brook the separation,\nand they secretly agreed to a clandestine assignation; but to these\ndetails we need not allude with any minuteness; sufficient to say that\nthey had no alternative but to bear the anguish and to part.",
        "Lady Feng crossed over again to the temple of the Iron Fence and\nascertained how things were progressing. But as Pao Chu was obstinate in\nher refusal to return home, Chia Chen found himself under the necessity\nof selecting a few servants to act as her companions. But the reader\nmust listen to what is said in the next chapter by way of explanation.",
        "  Chia Yuan-ch’un is, on account of her talents, selected to enter the\n      Feng Ts’ao Palace.\n  Ch’in Ching-ch’ing departs, in the prime of life, by the yellow spring\n      road.",
        "But we must now return to the two lads, Ch’in Chung and Pao-yü. After\nthey had passed, along with lady Feng from the Temple of the Iron Fence,\nwhither she had gone to see how things were getting on, they entered the\ncity in their carriages. On their arrival at home, they paid their\nobeisance to dowager lady Chia, madame Wang and the other members of the\nfamily, whence they returned to their own quarters, where nothing worth\nmentioning transpired during the night.",
        "On the next day, Pao-yü perceiving that the repairs to the outer\nschoolroom had been completed, settled with Ch’in Chung that they should\nhave evening classes. But as it happened that Ch’in Chung, who was\nnaturally of an extremely delicate physique, caught somewhat of a chill\nin the country and clandestinely indulged, besides, in an intimacy with\nChih Neng, which unavoidably made him fail to take good care of himself,\nhe was, shortly after his return, troubled with a cough and a feverish\ncold, with nausea for drink and food, and fell into such an extremely\npoor state of health that he simply kept indoors and nursed himself, and\nwas not in a fit condition to go to school. Pao-yü’s spirits were\nreadily damped, but as there was likewise no remedy he had no other\ncourse than to wait until his complete recovery, before he could make\nany arrangements.",
        "Lady Feng had meanwhile received a reply from Yün Kuang, in which he\ninformed her that everything had been satisfactorily settled, and the\nold nun apprised the Chang family that the major had actually suppressed\nhis indignation, hushed his complaints, and taken back the presents of\nthe previous engagement. But who would have ever anticipated that a\nfather and mother, whose hearts were set upon position and their\nambition upon wealth, could have brought up a daughter so conscious of\npropriety and so full of feeling as to seize the first opportunity,\nafter she had heard that she had been withdrawn from her former\nintended, and been promised to the Li family, to stealthily devise a way\nto commit suicide, by means of a handkerchief. The son of the Major,\nupon learning that Chin Ko had strangled herself, there and then jumped\ninto the river and drowned himself, as he too was a being full of love.\nThe Chang and Li families were, sad to relate, very much cut up, and, in\nvery truth, two lives and money had been sacrificed all to no use.",
        "Lady Feng, however, during this while, quietly enjoyed the three\nthousand taels, and madame Wang did not have even so much as the\nfaintest idea of the whole matter. But ever since this occasion, lady\nFeng’s audacity acquired more and more strength; and the actions of this\nkind, which she, in after days, performed, defy enumeration.",
        "One day, the very day on which Chia Cheng’s birthday fell, while the\nmembers of the two households of Ning and Jung were assembled together\noffering their congratulations, and unusual bustle and stir prevailed, a\ngatekeeper came in, at quite an unexpected moment, to announce that Mr.\nHsia, Metropolitan Head Eunuch of the six palaces, had come with the\nspecial purpose of presenting an edict from his Majesty; a bit of news\nwhich plunged Chia She, Chia Cheng and the whole company into great\nconsternation, as they could not make out what was up. Speedily\ninterrupting the theatrical performance, they had the banquet cleared,\nand the altar laid out with incense, and opening the centre gate they\nfell on their knees to receive the edict.",
        "Soon they caught sight of the head eunuch, Hsia Ping-chung, advancing on\nhorseback, and besides himself, a considerable retinue of eunuchs. The\neunuch Hsia did not, in fact, carry any mandate or present any decree;\nbut straightway advancing as far as the main hall, he dismounted, and,\nwith a face beaming with smiles, he walked into the Hall and took his\nstand on the southern side.",
        "“I have had the honour,” he said, “of receiving a special order to at\nonce summon Chia Cheng to present himself at Court and be admitted in\nHis Majesty’s presence in the Lin Ching Hall.”",
        "When he had delivered this message, he did not so much as take any tea,\nbut forthwith mounted his horse and took his leave.",
        "Chia Cheng and the others could not even conceive what omen this summons\nimplied, but he had no alternative but to change his clothes with all\nhaste and to present himself at Court, while dowager lady Chia and the\ninmates of the whole household were, in their hearts, a prey to such\nperplexity and uncertainty that they incessantly despatched messengers\non flying steeds to go and bring the news.",
        "After the expiry of four hours, they suddenly perceived Lai Ta and three\nor four other butlers run in, quite out of breath, through the\nceremonial gate and report the glad tidings. “We have received,” they\nadded, “our master’s commands, to hurriedly request her venerable\nladyship to take madame Wang and the other ladies into the Palace, to\nreturn thanks for His Majesty’s bounty;” and other words to the same\npurport.",
        "Dowager lady Chia was, at this time, standing, with agitated heart,\nunder the verandah of the Large Hall waiting for tidings, whilst the two\nladies, mesdames Hsing and Wang, Mrs. Yu, Li Wan, lady Feng, Ying Ch’un\nand her sisters, even up to Mrs. Hsüeh and the rest, were congregated in\none place ascertaining what was the news. Old lady Chia likewise called\nLai Ta in and minutely questioned him as to what had happened. “Your\nservants,” replied Lai Ta, “simply stood waiting outside the Lin Chuang\ngate, so that we were in total ignorance of what was going on inside,\nwhen presently the Eunuch Hsia came out and imparted to us the glad\ntidings; telling us that the eldest of the young ladies in our household\nhad been raised, by His Majesty, to be an overseer in the Feng Ts’ao\nPalace, and that he had, in addition, conferred upon her the rank of\nworthy and virtuous secondary consort. By and by, Mr. Chia Cheng came\nout and also told us the same thing. Master is now gone back again to\nthe Eastern Palace, whither he requests your venerable ladyship to go at\nonce and offer thanks for the Imperial favour.”",
        "When old lady Chia and the other members of the family heard these\ntidings they were at length reassured in their minds, and so elated were\nthey all in one moment that joy was visible in their very faces. Without\nloss of time, they commenced to don the gala dresses suitable to their\nrank; which done, old lady Chia led the way for the two ladies, mesdames\nHsing and Wang, as well as for Mrs. Yu; and their official chairs, four\nof them in all, entered the palace like a trail of fish; while Chia She\nand Chia Chen, who had likewise changed their clothes for their court\ndress, took Chia Se and Chia Jung along and proceeded in attendance upon\ndowager lady Chia.",
        "Indeed, of the two households of Ning and Jung, there was not one,\nwhether high or low, woman or man, who was not in a high state of\nexultation, with the exception of Pao-yü, who behaved just as if the\nnews had not reached his ears; and can you, reader, guess why? The fact\nis that Chih Neng, of the Water Moon Convent, had recently entered the\ncity in a surreptitious manner in search of Ch’in Chung; but, contrary\nto expectation, her visit came to be known by Ch’in Yeh, who drove Chih\nNeng away and laid hold of Ch’in Chung and gave him a flogging. But this\noutburst of temper of his brought about a relapse of his old complaint,\nwith the result that in three or five days, he, sad to say, succumbed.\nCh’in Chung had himself ever been in a delicate state of health and had\nbesides received a caning before he had got over his sickness, so that\nwhen he now saw his aged father pass away from the consequences of a fit\nof anger, he felt, at this stage, so full of penitence and distress that\nthe symptoms of his illness were again considerably aggravated. Hence it\nwas that Pao-yü was downcast and unhappy at heart, and that nothing\ncould, in spite of the promotion of Yuan Ch’un by imperial favour,\ndispel the depression of his spirits.",
        "Dowager lady Chia and the rest in due course offered thanks and returned\nhome, the relatives and friends came to present their congratulations,\ngreat stir and excitement prevailed during these few days in the two\nmansions of Ning and Jung, and every one was in high glee; but he alone\nlooked upon everything as if it were nothing; taking not the least\ninterest in anything; and as this reason led the whole family to sneer\nat him, the result was that he got more and more doltish.",
        "Luckily, however, Chia Lien and Tai-yü were on their way back, and had\ndespatched messengers, in advance, to announce the news that they would\nbe able to reach home the following day, so that when Pao-yü heard the\ntidings, he was at length somewhat cheered. And when he came to\ninstitute minute inquiries, he eventually found out: “that Chia Yü-ts’un\nwas also coming to the capital to have an audience with His Majesty,\nthat it was entirely because Wang Tzu-t’eng had repeatedly laid before\nthe Throne memorials recommending him that he was coming on this\noccasion to wait in the metropolis for a vacancy which he could fill up;\nthat as he was a kinsman of Chia Lien’s, acknowledging the same\nancestors as he did, and he stood, on the other hand, with Tai-yü, in\nthe relationship of tutor and pupil, he was in consequence following the\nsame road and coming as their companion; that Lin Ju-hai had already\nbeen buried in the ancestral vault, and that every requirement had been\nattended to with propriety; that Chia Lien, on this voyage to the\ncapital, would, had he progressed by the ordinary stages, have been over\na month before he could reach home, but that when he came to hear the\ngood news about Yuan Ch’un, he pressed on day and night to enter the\ncapital; and that the whole journey had been throughout, in every\nrespect, both pleasant and propitious.”",
        "But Pao-yü merely ascertained whether Tai-yü was all right, and did not\neven so much as trouble his mind with the rest of what he heard; and he\nremained on the tiptoe of expectation, till noon of the morrow; when, in\npoint of fact, it was announced that Mr. Lien, together with Miss Lin,\nhad made their entrance into the mansion. When they came face to face,\ngrief and joy vied with each other; and they could not help having a\ngood cry for a while; after which followed again expressions of sympathy\nand congratulations; while Pao-yü pondered within himself that Tai-yü\nhad become still more surpassingly handsome.",
        "Tai-yü had also brought along with her a good number of books, and she\npromptly gave orders that the sleeping rooms should be swept, and that\nthe various nicknacks should be put in their proper places. She further\nproduced a certain quantity of paper, pencils and other such things, and\ndistributed them among Pao Ch’ai, Ying Ch’un, Pao-yü and the rest; and\nPao-yü also brought out, with extreme care, the string of Ling-ling\nscented beads, which had been given to him by the Prince of Pei Ching,\nand handed them, in his turn, to Tai-yü as a present.",
        "“What foul man has taken hold of them?” exclaimed Tai-yü. “I don’t want\nany such things;” and as she forthwith dashed them down, and would not\naccept them, Pao-yü was under the necessity of taking them back. But for\nthe time being we will not allude to them, but devote our attention to\nChia Lien.",
        "Having, after his arrival home, paid his salutations to all the inmates,\nhe retired to his own quarters at the very moment that lady Feng had\nmultifarious duties to attend to, and had not even a minute to spare;\nbut, considering that Chia Lien had returned from a distant journey, she\ncould not do otherwise than put by what she had to do, and to greet him\nand wait on him.",
        "“Imperial uncle,” she said, in a jocose manner, when she realised that\nthere was no outsider present in the room, “I congratulate you! What\nfatigue and hardship you, Imperial uncle, have had to bear throughout\nthe whole journey, your humble servant heard yesterday, when the courier\nsent ahead came and announced that Your Highness would this day reach\nthis mansion. I have merely got ready a glass of mean wine for you to\nwipe down the dust with, but I wonder, whether Your Highness will deign\nto bestow upon it the lustre of your countenance, and accept it.”",
        "Chia Lien smiled. “How dare I presume to such an honour,” he added by\nway of rejoinder; “I’m unworthy of such attention! Many thanks, many\nthanks.”",
        "P’ing Erh and the whole company of waiting-maids simultaneously paid\ntheir obeisance to him, and this ceremony concluded, they presented tea.\nChia Lien thereupon made inquiries about the various matters, which had\ntranspired in their home after his departure, and went on to thank lady\nFeng for all the trouble she had taken in the management of them.",
        "“How could I control all these manifold matters,” remarked lady Feng;\n\"my experience is so shallow, my speech so dull and my mind so simple,\nthat if any one showed me a club, I would mistake it for a pin. Besides,\nI’m so tender-hearted that were any one to utter a couple of glib\nremarks, I couldn’t help feeling my heart give way to compassion and\nsympathy. I’ve had, in addition, no experience in any weighty questions;\nmy pluck is likewise so very small that when madame Wang has felt in the\nleast displeased, I have not been able to close my eyes and sleep.\nUrgently did I more than once resign the charge, but her ladyship\nwouldn’t again agree to it; maintaining, on the contrary, that my object\nwas to be at ease, and that I was not willing to reap experience.\nLeaving aside that she doesn’t know that I take things so much to heart,\nthat I can scoop the perspiration in handfuls, that I daren’t utter one\nword more than is proper, nor venture to recklessly take one step more\nthan I ought to, you know very well which of the women servants, in\ncharge of the menage in our household, is easy to manage! If ever I make\nthe slightest mistake, they laugh at me and poke fun at me; and if I\nincline a little one way, they show their displeasure by innuendoes;\nthey sit by and look on, they use every means to do harm, they stir up\ntrouble, they stand by on safe ground and look on and don’t give a\nhelping hand to lift any one they have thrown over, and they are, one\nand all of them, old hands in such tricks. I’m moreover young in years\nand not able to keep people in check, so that they naturally don’t show\nany regard for me! What is still more ridiculous is that after the death\nof Jung Erh’s wife in that mansion, brother Chen, time and again, begged\nmadame Wang, on his very knees, to do him the favour to ask me to lend\nhim a hand for several days. I repeatedly signified my refusal, but her\nladyship gave her consent in order to oblige him, so that I had no help\nbut to carry out her wish; putting, as is my wont, everything\ntopsy-turvey, and making matters worse than they were; with the result\nthat brother Chen up to this day bears me a grudge and regrets having\nasked for my assistance. When you see him to-morrow, do what you can to\nexcuse me by him. ’Young as she is,’ tell him, ’and without experience\nof the world, who ever could have instigated Mr. Chia Cheng to make such\na mistake as to choose her.’”",
        "While they were still chatting, they heard people talking in the outer\napartments, and lady Feng speedily inquired who it was. P’ing Erh\nentered the room to reply. “Lady Hsüeh,” she said, “has sent sister\nHsiang Ling over to ask me something; but I’ve already given her my\nanswer and sent her back.”",
        "“Quite so,” interposed Chia Lien with a smile. “A short while ago I went\nto look up Mrs. Hsüeh and came face to face with a young girl, whose\nfeatures were supremely perfect, and as I suspected that, in our\nhousehold, there was no such person, I asked in the course of\nconversation, Mrs. Hsüeh about her, and found out eventually that this\nwas the young waiting-maid they had purchased on their way to the\ncapital, Hsiang Ling by name, and that she had after all become an\ninmate of the household of that big fool Hsüeh. Since she’s had her hair\ndressed as a married woman she does look so much more pre-eminently\nbeautiful! But that big fool Hsüeh has really brought contamination upon\nher.”",
        "“Ai!” exclaimed lady Feng, “here you are back from a trip to Suchow and\nHang Chow, where you should have seen something of the world! and have\nyou still an eye as envious and a heart so covetous? Well, if you wish\nto bestow your love on her, there’s no difficulty worth speaking of.\nI’ll take P’ing Erh over and exchange her for her; what do you say to\nthat? that old brother Hsüeh is also one of those men, who, while eating\nwhat there is in the bowl, keeps an eye on what there is in the pan! For\nthe last year or so, as he couldn’t get Hsiang Ling to be his, he made\never so many distressing appeals to Mrs. Hsüeh; and Mrs. Hsüeh while\nesteeming Hsiang Ling’s looks, though fine, as after all a small matter,\n(thought) her deportment and conduct so far unlike those of other girls,\nso gentle and so demure that almost the very daughters of masters and\nmistresses couldn’t attain her standard, that she therefore went to the\ntrouble of spreading a banquet, and of inviting guests, and in open\ncourt, and in the legitimate course, she gave her to him for a secondary\nwife. But half a month had scarcely elapsed before he looked upon her\nalso as a good-for-nothing person as he did upon a large number of them!\nI can’t however help feeling pity for her in my heart.”",
        "Scarcely had she time to conclude what she had to say when a youth, on\nduty at the second gate, transmitted the announcement that Mr. Chia\nCheng was in the Library waiting for Mr. Secundus. At these words, Chia\nLien speedily adjusted his clothes, and left the apartment; and during\nhis absence, lady Feng inquired of P’ing Erh what Mrs. Hsüeh wanted a\nfew minutes back, that she sent Hsiang Ling round in such a hurry.",
        "“What Hsiang Ling ever came?” replied P’ing Erh. “I simply made use of\nher name to tell a lie for the occasion. Tell me, my lady, (what’s come\nto) Wang Erh’s wife? why she’s got so bad that there’s even no common\r\r\nsense left in her!” Saying this she again drew near lady Feng’s side,\nand in a soft tone of voice, she continued: “That interest of yours, my\nlady, she doesn’t send later, nor does she send it sooner; but she must\nsend it round the very moment when master Secundus is at home! But as\nluck would have it, I was in the hall, so that I came across her;\notherwise, she would have walked in and told your ladyship, and Mr.\nSecundus would naturally have come to know about it! And our master\nwould, with that frame of mind of his, have fished it out and spent it,\nhad the money even been at the bottom of a pan full of oil! and were he\nto have heard that my lady had private means, would he not have been\nstill more reckless in spending? Hence it was that, losing no time in\ntaking the money over, I had to tell her a few words which, who would\nhave thought, happened to be overheard by your ladyship; that’s why, in\nthe presence of master Secundus, I simply explained that Hsiang Ling had\ncome!”",
        "These words evoked a smile from lady Feng. “Mrs. Hsueh, I thought to\nmyself,” she observed, “knows very well that your Mr. Secundus has come,\nand yet, regardless of propriety, she, instead (of keeping her at home),\nsends some one over from her inner rooms! and it was you after all, you\nvixen, playing these pranks!”",
        "As she uttered this remark, Chia Lien walked in, and lady Feng issued\norders to serve the wine and the eatables, and husband and wife took\ntheir seats opposite to each other; but notwithstanding that lady Feng\nwas very partial to drink, she nevertheless did not have the courage to\nindulge her weakness, but merely partook of some to keep him company.\nChia Lien’s nurse, dame Chao, entered the room, and Chia Lien and lady\nFeng promptly pressed her to have a glass of wine, and bade her sit on\nthe stove-couch, but dame Chao was obstinate in her refusal. P’ing Erh\nand the other waiting-maids had at an early hour placed a square stool\nnext to the edge of the couch, where was likewise a small footstool, and\non this footstool dame Chao took a seat, whereupon Chia Lien chose two\ndishes of delicacies from the table, which he handed her to place on the\nsquare stool for her own use.",
        "“Dame Chao,” lady Feng remarked, “couldn’t very well bite through that,\nfor mind it might make her teeth drop! This morning,” she therefore\nasked of P’ing Erh, “I suggested that that shoulder of pork stewed with\nham was so tender as to be quite the thing to be given to dame Chao to\neat; and how is it you haven’t taken it over to her? But go at once and\ntell them to warm it and bring it in! Dame Chao,” she went on, “just you\ntaste this Hui Ch’üan wine brought by your foster-son.”",
        "“I’ll drink it,” replied dame Chao, “but you, my lady, must also have a\ncup: what’s there to fear? the one thing to guard against is any excess,\nthat’s all! But I’ve now come over, not for any wine or eatables; on the\ncontrary, there’s a serious matter, which I would ask your ladyship to\nimpress on your mind, and to show me some regard, for this master of\nours is only good to utter fine words, but when the time (to act) does\ncome, he forgets all about us! As I have had the good fortune to nurse\nhim in his infancy and to bring him up to this age, ’I too have grown\nold in years,’ I said to him, ’and all that belong to me are those two\nsons, and do look upon them with some particular favour!’ With any one\nelse I shouldn’t have ventured to open my mouth, but him I anyway\nentreated time and again on several occasions. His assent was of course\nwell and good, but up to this very moment he still withholds his help.\nNow besides from the heavens has dropped such a mighty piece of good\nluck; and in what place will there be no need of servants? that’s why I\ncome to tell you, my lady, as is but right, for were I to depend upon\nour master, I fear I shall even die of starvation.”",
        "Lady Feng laughed. “You’d better,” she suggested, “put those two elder\nfoster brothers of his both under my charge! But you’ve nursed that\nfoster-son from his babyhood, and don’t you yet know that disposition of\nhis, how that he takes his skin and flesh and sticks it, (not on the\nbody of a relative), but, on the contrary, on that of an outsider and\nstranger? (to Chia Lien.) Which of those foster brothers whom you have\nnow discarded, isn’t clearly better than others? and were you to have\nshown them some favour and consideration, who would have ventured to\nhave said ’don’t?’ Instead of that, you confer benefits upon thorough\nstrangers, and all to no purpose whatever! But these words of mine are\nalso incorrect, eh? for those whom we regard as strangers you,\ncontrariwise, will treat just as if they were relatives!”",
        "At these words every one present in the room burst out laughing; even\nnurse Chao could not repress herself; and as she invoked Buddha,–\"In\nvery truth,” she exclaimed, “in this room has sprung up a kind-hearted\nperson! as regards relatives and strangers, such foolish distinctions\naren’t drawn by our master; and it’s simply because he’s full of pity\nand is tenderhearted that he can’t put off any one who gives vent to a\nfew words of entreaty, and nothing else!”",
        "“That’s quite it!” rejoined lady Feng smiling sarcastically, “to those\nwhom he looks upon as relatives, he’s kindhearted, but with me and his\nmother he’s as hard as steel.”",
        "“What you say, my lady, is very considerate,” remarked nurse Chao, “and\nI’m really so full of delight that I’ll have another glass of good wine!\nand, if from this time forward, your ladyship will act as you think\nbest, I’ll have then nothing to be sorry for!”",
        "Chia Lien did not at this juncture feel quite at his ease, but he could\ndo no more than feign a smile. “You people,” he said, “should leave off\ntalking nonsense, and bring the eatables at once and let us have our\nmeal, as I have still to go on the other side and see Mr. Chia Chen, to\nconsult with him about business.”",
        "“To be sure you have,” ventured lady Feng, “and you shouldn’t neglect\nyour legitimate affairs; but what did Mr. Chia Chen tell you when he\nsent for you just a while back?”",
        "“It was about the visit (of Yuan Ch’un) to her parents,” Chia Lien\nexplained.",
        "“Has after all permission for the visit been granted?” lady Feng\ninquired with alacrity.",
        "“Though not quite granted,” Chia Lien replied joyously, “it’s\nnevertheless more or less an accomplished fact.”",
        "“This is indeed evidence of the great bounty of the present Emperor!\"\nlady Feng observed smirkingly; “one doesn’t hear in books, or see in\nplays, written from time to time, any mention of such an instance, even\nso far back as the days of old!”",
        "Dame Chao took up again the thread of the conversation. “Indeed it’s\nso!” she interposed; “But I’m in very truth quite stupid from old age,\nfor I’ve heard every one, high and low, clamouring during these few\ndays, something or other about ’Hsing Ch’in’ or no ’Hsing Ch’in,’ but I\ndidn’t really pay any heed to it; and now again, here’s something more\nabout this ’Hsing Ch’in,’ but what’s it all about, I wonder?”",
        "“The Emperor at present on the Throne,” explained Chia Lien, “takes into\nconsideration the feelings of his people. In the whole world, there is\n(in his opinion), no more essential thing than filial piety; maintaining\nthat the feelings of father, mother, son and daughter are\nindiscriminately subject to one principle, without any distinction\nbetween honorable and mean. The present Emperor himself day and night\nwaits upon their majesties his Father and the Empress Dowager, and yet\ncannot, in the least degree, carry out to the full his ideal of filial\npiety. The secondary consorts, meritorious persons and other inmates of\nthe Palace, he remembered, had entered within its precincts many years\nback, casting aside fathers and mothers, so how could they not help\nthinking of them? Besides, the fathers and mothers, who remain at home\nmust long for their daughters, of whom they cannot get even so much as a\nglimpse, and if, through this solicitude, they were to contract any\nillness, the harmony of heaven would also be seriously impaired, so for\nthis reason, he memorialised the Emperor, his father, and the Empress\nDowager that every month, on the recurrence of the second and sixth\ndays, permission should be accorded to the relatives of the imperial\nconsorts to enter the palace and make application to see their\ndaughters. The Emperor, his father, and Empress Dowager were, forthwith,\nmuch delighted by this representation, and eulogised, in high terms, the\npiety and generosity of the present Emperor, his regard for the will of\nheaven and his research into the nature of things. Both their sacred\nMajesties consequently also issued a decree to the effect: that the\nentrance of the relatives of the imperial consorts into the Palace could\nnot but interfere with the dignity of the state, and the rules of\nconventional rites, but that as the mothers and daughters could not\ngratify the wishes of their hearts, Their Majesties would, after all,\nshow a high proof of expedient grace, and issue a special command that:\n’exclusive of the generous bounty, by virtue of which the worthy\nrelations of the imperial consorts could enter the palace on the second\nand sixth days, any family, having extensive accommodation and separate\ncourts suitable for the cantonment of the imperial body-guard, could,\nwithout any detriment, make application to the Inner Palace, for the\nentrance of the imperial chair into the private residences, to the end\nthat the personal feelings of relations might be gratified, and that\nthey should collectively enjoy the bliss of a family reunion.’ After the\nissue of this decree, who did not leap from grateful joy! The father of\nthe honourable secondary consort Chou has now already initiated works,\nin his residence, for the repairs to the separate courts necessary for\nthe visiting party. Wu T’ien-yu too, the father of Wu, the distinguished\nconsort, has likewise gone outside the city walls in search of a\r\nsuitable plot of ground; and don’t these amount to well-nigh\naccomplished facts?”",
        "“O-mi-to-fu!” exclaimed dame Chao. “Is it really so? but from what you\nsay, our family will also be making preparations for the reception of\nthe eldest young lady!”",
        "“That goes without saying,” added Chia Lien, “otherwise, for what\npurpose could we be in such a stir just now?”",
        "“It’s of course so!” interposed lady Feng smiling, “and I shall now have\nan opportunity of seeing something great of the world. My misfortune is\nthat I’m young by several years; for had I been born twenty or thirty\nyears sooner, all these old people wouldn’t really be now treating me\ncontemptuously for not having seen the world! To begin with, the Emperor\nTai Tsu, in years gone by, imitated the old policy of Shun, and went on\na tour, giving rise to more stir than any book could have ever produced;\nbut I happen to be devoid of that good fortune which could have enabled\nme to come in time.”",
        "“Ai ya, ya!” ejaculated dame Chao, “such a thing is rarely met with in a\nthousand years! I was old enough at that time to remember the\noccurrence! Our Chia family was then at Ku Su, Yangchow and all along\nthat line, superintending the construction of ocean vessels, and the\nrepairs to the seaboard. This was the only time in which preparations\nwere made for the reception of the Emperor, and money was lavished in\nquantities as great as the billowing waters of the sea!”",
        "This subject once introduced, lady Feng took up the thread of the\nconversation with vehemence. “Our Wang family,” she said, “did also make\npreparations on one occasion. At that time my grandfather was in sole\ncharge of all matters connected with tribute from various states, as\nwell as with general levées, so that whenever any foreigners arrived,\nthey all came to our house to be entertained, while the whole of the\ngoods, brought by foreign vessels from the two Kuang provinces, from\nFukien, Yunnan and Chekiang, were the property of our family.”",
        "“Who isn’t aware of these facts?” ventured dame Chao; “there is up to\nthis day a saying that, ’in the eastern sea, there was a white jade bed\nrequired, and the dragon prince came to request Mr. Wang of Chin Ling\n(to give it to him)!’ This saying relates to your family, my lady, and\nremains even now in vogue. The Chen family of Chiang Nan has recently\nheld, oh such a fine old standing! it alone has entertained the Emperor\non four occasions! Had we not seen these things with our own eyes, were\nwe to tell no matter whom, they wouldn’t surely ever believe them! Not\nto speak of the money, which was as plentiful as mud, all things,\nwhether they were to be found in the world or not, were they not heaped\nup like hills, and collected like the waters of the sea? But with the\nfour characters representing sin and pity they didn’t however trouble\ntheir minds.”",
        "“I’ve often heard,” continued lady Feng, “my eldest uncle say that\nthings were in such a state, and how couldn’t I believe? but what\nsurprises me is how it ever happened that this family attained such\nopulence and honour!”",
        "“I’ll tell your ladyship and all in one sentence,” replied nurse Chao.\n\"Why they simply took the Emperor’s money and spent it for the Emperor’s\nperson, that’s all! for what family has such a lot of money as to\nindulge in this useless extravagance?”",
        "While they were engaged in this conversation, a servant came a second\ntime, at the instance of madame Wang, to see whether lady Feng had\nfinished her meal or not; and lady Feng forthwith concluding that there\nmust be something waiting for her to attend to, hurriedly rushed through\nher repast. She had just rinsed her mouth and was about to start when\nthe youths, on duty at the second gate, also reported that the two\ngentlemen, Mr. Chia Jung and Mr. Chia Se, belonging to the Eastern\nmansion, had arrived.",
        "Chia Lien had, at length, rinsed his mouth; but while P’ing Erh\npresented a basin for him to wash his hands, he perceived the two young\nmen walk in, and readily inquired of them what they had to say.",
        "Lady Feng was, on account (of their arrival), likewise compelled to\nstay, and she heard Chia Jung take the lead and observe: “My father has\nsent me to tell you, uncle, that the gentlemen, have already decided\nthat the whole extent of ground, starting from the East side, borrowing\n(for the occasion) the flower garden of the Eastern mansion, straight up\nto the North West, had been measured and found to amount in all to three\nand a half li; that it will be suitable for the erection of extra\naccommodation for the visiting party; that they have already\ncommissioned an architect to draw a plan, which will be ready by\nto-morrow; that as you, uncle, have just returned home, and must\nunavoidably feel fatigued, you need not go over to our house, but that\nif you have anything to say you should please come tomorrow morning, as\nearly as you can, and consult verbally with him.”",
        "“Thank uncle warmly,” Chia Lien rejoined smilingly, “for the trouble he\nhas taken in thinking of me; I shall, in that case, comply with his\nwishes and not go over. This plan is certainly the proper one, for while\ntrouble will thus be saved, the erection of the quarters will likewise\nbe an easy matter; for had a distinct plot to be selected and to be\npurchased, it would involve far greater difficulties. What’s more,\nthings wouldn’t, after all, be what they properly should be. When you\nget back, tell your father that this decision is the right one, and that\nshould the gentlemen have any further wish to introduce any change in\ntheir proposals, it will rest entirely with my uncle to prevent them, as\nit’s on no account advisable to go and cast one’s choice on some other\nplot; that to-morrow as soon as it’s daylight, I’ll come and pay my\nrespects to uncle, when we can enter into further details in our\ndeliberations!”",
        "Chia Jung hastily signified his assent by several yes’s, and Chia Se\nalso came forward to deliver his message. “The mission to Ku Su,” he\nexplained, “to find tutors, to purchase servant girls, and to obtain\nmusical instruments, and theatrical properties and the like, my uncle\nhas confided to me; and as I’m to take along with me the two sons of a\ncouple of majordomos, and two companions of the family, besides, Tan\nP’ing-jen and Pei Ku-hsiu, he has, for this reason, enjoined me to come\nand see you, uncle.”",
        "Upon hearing this, Chia Lien scrutinised Chia Se. “What!” he asked, “are\nyou able to undertake these commissions? These matters are, it’s true,\nof no great moment; but there’s something more hidden in them!”",
        "Chia Se smiled. “The best thing I can do,” he remarked, “will be to\nexecute them in my novice sort of way, that’s all.”",
        "Chia Jung was standing next to lady Feng, out of the light of the lamp,\nand stealthily pulled the lapel of her dress. Lady Feng understood the\nhint, and putting on a smiling expression, “You are too full of fears!\"\nshe interposed. “Is it likely that our uncle Chen doesn’t, after all,\nknow better than we do what men to employ, that you again give way to\napprehensions that he isn’t up to the mark! but who are those who are,\nin every respect, up to the mark? These young fellows have grown up\nalready to this age, and if they haven’t eaten any pork, they have\nnevertheless seen a pig run. If Mr. Chen has deputed him to go, he is\nsimply meant to sit under the general’s standard; and do you imagine,\nforsooth, that he has, in real earnest, told him to go and bargain about\nthe purchase money, and to interview the brokers himself? My own idea is\nthat (the choice) is a very good one.”",
        "“Of course it is!” observed Chia Lien; “but it isn’t that I entertain\nany wish to be factious; my only object is to devise some plan or other\nfor him. Whence will,” he therefore went on to ask, “the money required\nfor this purpose come from?”",
        "“A little while ago the deliberations reached this point,” rejoined Chia\nSe; “and Mr. Lai suggested that there was no necessity at all to take\nany funds from the capital, as the Chen family, in Chiang Nan, had still\nin their possession Tls. 50,000 of our money. That he would to-morrow\nwrite a letter of advice and a draft for us to take along, and that we\nshould, first of all, obtain cash to the amount of Tls. 30,000, and let\nthe balance of Tls. 20,000 remain over, for the purchase of painted\nlanterns, and coloured candles, as well as for the outlay for every kind\nof portieres, banners, curtains and streamers.”",
        "Chia Lien nodded his head. “This plan is first-rate!” he added.",
        "“Since that be so,” observed lady Feng, as she addressed herself to Chia\nSe, “I’ve two able and reliable men; and if you would take them with\nyou, to attend to these matters, won’t it be to your convenience?”",
        "Chia Se forced a smile. “I was just on the point,” he rejoined, “of\nasking you, aunt, for the loan of two men, so that this suggestion is a\nstrange coincidence.”",
        "As he went on to ascertain what were their names, lady Feng inquired\nwhat they were of nurse Chao. But nurse Chao had, by this time, become\nquite dazed from listening to the conversation, and P’ing Erh had to\ngive her a push, as she smiled, before she returned to consciousness.\n\"The one,” she hastened to reply, “is called Chao T’ien-liang and the\nother Chao T’ien-tung.”",
        "“Whatever you do,” suggested lady Feng, “don’t forget them; but now I’m\noff to look after my duties.”",
        "With these words, she left the room, and Chia Jung promptly followed her\nout, and with gentle voice he said to her: “Of whatever you want, aunt,\nissue orders that a list be drawn up, and I’ll give it to my brother to\ntake with him, and he’ll carry out your commissions according to the\nlist.”",
        "“Don’t talk nonsense!” replied lady Feng laughing; “I’ve found no place,\nas yet, where I could put away all my own things; and do the stealthy\npractices of you people take my fancy?”",
        "As she uttered these words she straightway went her way.",
        "Chia Se, at this time, likewise, asked Chia Lien: “If you want anything\n(in the way of curtains), I can conveniently have them woven for you,\nalong with the rest, and bring them as a present to you.”",
        "“Don’t be in such high glee!” Chia Lien urged with a grin, “you’ve but\nrecently been learning how to do business, and have you come first and\nforemost to excel in tricks of this kind? If I require anything, I’ll of\ncourse write and tell you, but we needn’t talk about it.”",
        "Having finished speaking, he dismissed the two young men; and, in quick\nsuccession, servants came to make their business reports, not limited to\nthree and five companies, but as Chia Lien felt exhausted, he forthwith\nsent word to those on duty at the second gate not to allow any one at\nall to communicate any reports, and that the whole crowd should wait\ntill the next day, when he would give his mind to what had to be done.",
        "Lady Feng did not come to retire to rest till the third watch; but\nnothing need be said about the whole night.",
        "The next morning, at an early hour, Chia Lien got up and called on Chia\nShe and Chia Cheng; after which, he came over to the Ning Kuo mansion;\nwhen, in company with the old major-domos and other servants, as well as\nwith several old family friends and companions, he inspected the grounds\nof the two mansions, and drew plans of the palatial buildings (for the\naccommodation of the Imperial consort and her escort) on her visit to\nher parents; deliberating at the same time, on the subject of the works\nand workmen.",
        "From this day the masons and workmen of every trade were collected to\nthe full number; and the articles of gold, silver, copper, and pewter,\nas well as the earth, timber, tiles, and bricks, were brought over, and\ncarried in, in incessant supplies. In the first place, orders were\nissued to the workmen to demolish the wall and towers of the garden of\nConcentrated Fragrance, and extend a passage to connect in a straight\nline with the large court in the East of the Jung mansion; for the whole\nextent of servants’ quarters on the Eastern side of the Jung mansion had\npreviously been pulled down.",
        "The two residences of Ning and Jung were, in these days, it is true,\ndivided by a small street, which served as a boundary line, and there\nwas no communication between them, but this narrow passage was also\nprivate property, and not in any way a government street, so that they\ncould easily be connected, and as in the garden of Concentrated\nFragrance, there was already a stream of running water, which had been\nintroduced through the corner of the Northern wall, there was no further\nneed now of going to the trouble of bringing in another. Although the\nrockeries and trees were not sufficient, the place where Chia She lived,\nwas an old garden of the Jung mansion, so that the bamboos, trees, and\nrockeries in that compound, as well as the arbours, railings and other\nsuch things could all be very well removed to the front; and by these\nmeans, these two grounds, situated as they were besides so very near to\neach other, could, by being thrown into one, conduce to the saving of\nconsiderable capital and labour; for, in spite of some deficiency, what\nhad to be supplied did not amount to much. And it devolved entirely upon\na certain old Hu, a man of note, styled Shan Tzu-yeh, to deliberate upon\none thing after another, and to initiate its construction.",
        "Chia Cheng was not up to these ordinary matters, so that it fell to Chia\nShe, Chia Chen, Chia Lien, Lai Ta, Lai Sheng, Lin Chih-hsiao, Wu\nHsin-teng, Chan Kuang, Ch’eng Jih-hsing and several others to allot the\nsites, to set things in order, (and to look after) the heaping up of\nrockeries, the digging of ponds, the construction of two-storied\nbuildings, the erection of halls, the plantation of bamboos and the\ncultivation of flowers, everything connected with the improvement of the\nscenery devolving, on the other hand, upon Shan Tzu-yeh to make\nprovision for, and after leaving Court, he would devote such leisure\nmoments as he had to merely going everywhere to give a look at the most\nimportant spots, and to consult with Chia She and the others; after\nwhich he troubled his mind no more with anything. And as Chia She did\nnothing else than stay at home and lie off, whenever any matter turned\nup, trifling though it may have been as a grain of mustard seed or a\nbean, Chia Chen and his associates had either to go and report it in\nperson or to write a memorandum of it. Or if he had anything to say, he\nsent for Chia Lien, Lai Ta and others to come and receive his\ninstructions. Chia Jung had the sole direction of the manufacture of the\narticles in gold and silver; and as for Chia Se, he had already set out\non his journey to Ku Su. Chia Chen, Lai Ta and the rest had also to call\nout the roll with the names of the workmen, to superintend the works and\nother duties relative thereto, which could not be recorded by one pen\nalone; sufficient to say that a great bustle and stir prevailed, but to\nthis subject we shall not refer for a time, but allude to Pao-yü.",
        "As of late there were in the household concerns of this magnitude to\nattend to, Chia Cheng did not come to examine him in his lessons, so\nthat he was, of course, in high spirits, but, as unfortunately Ch’in\nChung’s complaint became, day by day, more serious, he was at the same\ntime really so very distressed at heart on his account, that enjoyment\nwas for him out of the question.",
        "On this day, he got up as soon as it was dawn, and having just combed\nhis hair and washed his face and hands, he was bent upon going to ask\ndowager lady Chia to allow him to pay a visit to Ch’in Chung, when he\nsuddenly espied Ming Yen peep round the curtain-wall at the second gate,\nand then withdraw his head. Pao-yü promptly walked out and inquired what\nhe was up to.",
        "“Mr. Ch’in Chung,” observed Ming Yen, “is not well at all.”",
        "Pao-yü at these words was quite taken aback. “It was only yesterday,” he\nhastily added, “that I saw him, and he was still bright and cheery; and\nhow is it that he’s anything but well now?”",
        "“I myself can’t explain,” replied Ming Yen; “but just a few minutes ago\nan old man belonging to his family came over with the express purpose of\ngiving me the tidings.”",
        "Upon hearing this news, Pao-yü there and then turned round and told\ndowager lady Chia; and the old lady issued directions to depute some\ntrustworthy persons to accompany him. “Let him go,” (she said), “and\nsatisfy his feelings towards his fellow-scholar; but as soon as he has\ndone, he must come back; and don’t let him tarry too long.”",
        "Pao-yü with hurried step left the room and came and changed his clothes.\nBut as on his arrival outside, the carriage had not as yet been got\nready, he fell into such a state of excitement, that he went round and\nround all over the hall in quite an erratic manner. In a short while,\nafter pressure had been brought to bear, the carriage arrived, and\nspeedily mounting the vehicle, he drove up to the door of Ch’in Chung’s\nhouse, followed by Li Kuei, Ming Yen and the other servants. Everything\nwas quiet. Not a soul was about. Like a hive of bees they flocked into\nthe house, to the astonishment of two distant aunts, and of several male\ncousins of Ch’in Chung, all of whom had no time to effect their retreat.",
        "Ch’in Chung had, by this time, had two or three fainting fits, and had\nalready long ago been changed his mat. As soon as Pao-yü realised the\nsituation, he felt unable to repress himself from bursting forth aloud.\nLi Kuei promptly reasoned with him. “You shouldn’t go on in this way,\"\nhe urged, “you shouldn’t. It’s because Mr. Ch’in is so weak that lying\nflat on the stove-couch naturally made his bones feel uncomfortable; and\nthat’s why he has temporarily been removed down here to ease him a\nlittle. But if you, sir, go on in this way, will you not, instead of\ndoing him any good, aggravate his illness?”",
        "At these words, Pao-yü accordingly restrained himself, and held his\ntongue; and drawing near, he gazed at Ch’in Chung’s face, which was as\nwhite as wax, while with closed eyes, he gasped for breath, rolling\nabout on his pillow.",
        "“Brother Ching,” speedily exclaimed Pao-yü, “Pao-yü is here!” But though\nhe shouted out two or three consecutive times, Ch’in Chung did not heed\nhim.",
        "“Pao-yü has come!” Pao-yü went on again to cry. But Ch’in Chung’s spirit\nhad already departed from his body, leaving behind only a faint breath\nof superfluous air in his lungs.",
        "He had just caught sight of a number of recording devils, holding a\nwarrant and carrying chains, coming to seize him, but Ch’in Chung’s soul\nwould on no account go along with them; and remembering how that there\nwas in his home no one to assume the direction of domestic affairs, and\nfeeling concerned that Chih Neng had as yet no home, he consequently\nused hundreds of arguments in his entreaties to the recording devils;\nbut alas! these devils would, none of them, show him any favour. On the\ncontrary, they heaped invectives upon Ch’in Chung.",
        "“You’re fortunate enough to be a man of letters,” they insinuated, “and\ndon’t you know the common saying that: ’if the Prince of Hell call upon\nyou to die at the third watch, who can presume to retain you, a human\nbeing, up to the fifth watch?’ In our abode, in the unseen, high as well\nas low, have all alike a face made of iron, and heed not selfish\nmotives; unlike the mortal world, where favouritism and partiality\nprevail. There exist therefore many difficulties in the way (to our\nyielding to your wishes).”",
        "While this fuss was going on, Ch’in Chung’s spirit suddenly grasped the\nfour words, “Pao-yü has come,” and without loss of time, it went on\nagain to make further urgent appeals. “Gentlemen, spiritual deputies,\"\nit exclaimed; “show me a little mercy and allow me to return to make\njust one remark to an intimate friend of mine, and I’ll be back again.”",
        "“What intimate friend is this again?” the devils observed with one\nvoice.",
        "“I’m not deceiving you, gentlemen,” rejoined Ch’in Chung; “it’s the\ngrandson of the duke of Jung Kuo, whose infant name is Pao-yü.”",
        "The Decider of life was, at first, upon hearing these words, so seized\nwith dismay that he vehemently abused the devils sent on the errand.",
        "“I told you,” he shouted, “to let him go back for a turn; but you would\nby no means comply with my words! and now do you wait until he has\nsummoned a man of glorious fortune and prosperous standing to at last\ndesist?”",
        "When the company of devils perceived the manner of the Decider of life,\nthey were all likewise so seized with consternation that they bustled\nwith hand and feet; while with hearts also full of resentment: “You,\nsir,” they replied, “were at one time such a terror, formidable as\nlightning; and are you not forsooth able to listen with equanimity to\nthe two sounds of ’Pao-yü?’ our humble idea is that mortal as he is, and\nimmortal as we are, it wouldn’t be to our credit if we feared him!”",
        "But whether Ch’in Chung, after all, died or survived, the next chapter\nwill explain.",
        "  In the Ta Kuan Garden, (Broad Vista,) the merits of Pao-yü are put to\n      the test, by his being told to write devices for scrolls and\n      tablets.\n  Yuan Ch’un returns to the Jung Kuo mansion, on a visit to her parents,\n      and offers her congratulations to them on the feast of lanterns,\n      on the fifteenth of the first moon.",
        "Ch’in Chung, to resume our story, departed this life, and Pao-yü went on\nso unceasingly in his bitter lamentations, that Li Kuei and the other\nservants had, for ever so long, an arduous task in trying to comfort him\nbefore he desisted; but on his return home he was still exceedingly\ndisconsolate.",
        "Dowager lady Chia afforded monetary assistance to the amount of several\ntens of taels; and exclusive of this, she had sacrificial presents\nlikewise got ready. Pao-yü went and paid a visit of condolence to the\nfamily, and after seven days the funeral and burial took place, but\nthere are no particulars about them which could be put on record.",
        "Pao-yü, however, continued to mourn (his friend) from day to day, and\nwas incessant in his remembrance of him, but there was likewise no help\nfor it. Neither is it known after how many days he got over his grief.",
        "On this day, Chia Chen and the others came to tell Chia Cheng that the\nworks in the garden had all been reported as completed, and that Mr.\nChia She had already inspected them. “It only remains,” (they said),\n\"for you, sir, to see them; and should there possibly be anything which\nis not proper, steps will be at once taken to effect the alterations, so\nthat the tablets and scrolls may conveniently be written.”",
        "After Chia Cheng had listened to these words, he pondered for a while.\n\"These tablets and scrolls,” he remarked, “present however a difficult\ntask. According to the rites, we should, in order to obviate any\nshortcoming, request the imperial consort to deign and compose them; but\nif the honourable consort does not gaze upon the scenery with her own\neyes, it will also be difficult for her to conceive its nature and\nindite upon it! And were we to wait until the arrival of her highness,\nto request her to honour the grounds with a visit, before she composes\nthe inscriptions, such a wide landscape, with so many pavilions and\narbours, will, without one character in the way of a motto, albeit it\nmay abound with flowers, willows, rockeries, and streams, nevertheless\nin no way be able to show off its points of beauty to advantage.”",
        "The whole party of family companions, who stood by, smiled. “Your views,\nremarkable sir,” they ventured, “are excellent; but we have now a\nproposal to make. Tablets and scrolls for every locality cannot, on any\naccount, be dispensed with, but they could not likewise, by any means,\nbe determined upon for good! Were now, for the time being, two, three or\nfour characters fixed upon, harmonising with the scenery, to carry out,\nfor form’s sake, the idea, and were they provisionally utilised as\nmottoes for the lanterns, tablets and scrolls, and hung up, pending the\narrival of her highness, and her visit through the grounds, when she\ncould be requested to decide upon the devices, would not two exigencies\nbe met with satisfactorily?”",
        "“Your views are perfectly correct,” observed Chia Cheng, after he had\nheard their suggestion; “and we should go to-day and have a look at the\nplace so as then to set to work to write the inscriptions; which, if\nsuitable, can readily be used; and, if unsuitable, Yü-ts’un can then be\nsent for, and asked to compose fresh ones.”",
        "The whole company smiled. “If you, sir, were to compose them to-day,\"\nthey ventured, “they are sure to be excellent; and what need will there\nbe again to wait for Yü-ts’un!”",
        "“You people are not aware,” Chia Cheng added with a smiling countenance,\n\"that I’ve been, even in my young days, very mediocre in the composition\nof stanzas on flowers, birds, rockeries and streams; and that now that\nI’m well up in years and have moreover the fatigue and trouble of my\nofficial duties, I’ve become in literary compositions like these, which\nrequire a light heart and gladsome mood, still more inapt. Were I even\nto succeed in composing any, they will unavoidably be so doltish and\nforced that they would contrariwise be instrumental in making the\nflowers, trees, garden and pavilions, through their demerits, lose in\nbeauty, and present instead no pleasing feature.”",
        "“This wouldn’t anyhow matter,” remonstrated all the family companions,\n\"for after perusing them we can all decide upon them together, each one\nof us recommending those he thinks best; which if excellent can be kept,\nand if faulty can be discarded; and there’s nothing unfeasible about\nthis!”",
        "“This proposal is most apposite,” rejoined Chia Cheng. “What’s more, the\nweather is, I rejoice, fine to-day; so let’s all go in a company and\nhave a look.”",
        "Saying this, he stood up and went forward, at the head of the whole\nparty; while Chia Chen betook himself in advance into the garden to let\nevery one know of their coming. As luck would have it, Pao-yü–for he\nhad been these last few days thinking of Ch’in Chung and so ceaselessly\nsad and wounded at heart, that dowager lady Chia had frequently directed\nthe servants to take him into the new garden to play–made his entrance\njust at this very time, and suddenly became aware of the arrival of Chia\nChen, who said to him with a smile, “Don’t you yet run away as fast as\nyou can? Mr. Chia Cheng will be coming in a while.”",
        "At these words, Pao-yü led off his nurse and the youths, and rushed at\nonce out of the garden, like a streak of smoke; but as he turned a\ncorner, he came face to face with Chia Cheng, who was advancing towards\nthat direction, at the head of all the visitors; and as he had no time\nto get out of the way, the only course open to him was to stand on one\nside.",
        "Chia Cheng had, of late, heard the tutor extol him by saying that he\ndisplayed special ability in rhyming antithetical lines, and that\nalthough he did not like to read his books, he nevertheless possessed\nsome depraved talents, and hence it was that he was induced at this\nmoment to promptly bid him follow him into the garden, with the intent\nof putting him to the test.",
        "Pao-yü could not make out what his object was, but he was compelled to\nfollow. As soon as they reached the garden gate, and he caught sight of\nChia Chen, standing on one side, along with several managers: “See that\nthe garden gate is closed for a time,” Chia Cheng exclaimed, “for we’ll\nfirst see the outside and then go in.”",
        "Chia Chen directed a servant to close the gate, and Chia Cheng first\nlooked straight ahead of him towards the gate and espied on the same\nside as the main entrance a suite of five apartments. Above, the\ncylindrical tiles resembled the backs of mud eels. The doors, railings,\nwindows, and frames were all finely carved with designs of the new\nfashion, and were painted neither in vermilion nor in white colours. The\nwhole extent of the walls was of polished bricks of uniform colour;\nwhile below, the white marble on the terrace and steps was engraved with\nwestern foreign designs; and when he came to look to the right and to\nthe left, everything was white as snow. At the foot of the white-washed\nwalls, tiger-skin pebbles were, without regard to pattern, promiscuously\ninserted in the earth in such a way as of their own selves to form\nstreaks. Nothing fell in with the custom of gaudiness and display so\nmuch in vogue, so that he naturally felt full of delight; and, when he\nforthwith asked that the gate should be thrown open, all that met their\neyes was a long stretch of verdant hills, which shut in the view in\nfront of them.",
        "“What a fine hill, what a pretty hill!” exclaimed all the companions\nwith one voice.",
        "“Were it not for this one hill,” Chia Cheng explained, “whatever scenery\nis contained in it would clearly strike the eye, as soon as one entered\ninto the garden, and what pleasure would that have been?”",
        "“Quite so,” rejoined all of them. “But without large hills and ravines\nin one’s breast (liberal capacities), how could one attain such\nimagination!”",
        "After the conclusion of this remark, they cast a glance ahead of them,\nand perceived white rugged rocks looking, either like goblins, or\nresembling savage beasts, lying either crossways, or in horizontal or\nupright positions; on the surface of which grew moss and lichen with\nmottled hues, or parasitic plants, which screened off the light; while,\nslightly visible, wound, among the rocks, a narrow pathway like the\nintestines of a sheep.",
        "“If we were now to go and stroll along by this narrow path,” Chia Cheng\nsuggested, “and to come out from over there on our return, we shall have\nbeen able to see the whole grounds.”",
        "Having finished speaking, he asked Chia Chen to lead the way; and he\nhimself, leaning on Pao-yü, walked into the gorge with leisurely step.\nRaising his head, he suddenly beheld on the hill a block of stone, as\nwhite as the surface of a looking-glass, in a site which was, in very\ndeed, suitable to be left for an inscription, as it was bound to meet\nthe eye.",
        "“Gentlemen,” Chia Cheng observed, as he turned his head round and\nsmiled, “please look at this spot. What name will it be fit to give it?”",
        "When the company heard his remark, some maintained that the two words\n\"Heaped verdure” should be written; and others upheld that the device\nshould be “Embroidered Hill.” Others again suggested: “Vying with the\nHsiang Lu;” and others recommended “the small Chung Nan.” And various\nkinds of names were proposed, which did not fall short of several tens.",
        "All the visitors had been, it must be explained, aware at an early\nperiod of the fact that Chia Cheng meant to put Pao-yü’s ability to the\ntest, and for this reason they merely proposed a few combinations in\ncommon use. But of this intention, Pao-yü himself was likewise\ncognizant.",
        "After listening to the suggestions, Chia Cheng forthwith turned his head\nround and bade Pao-yü think of some motto.",
        "“I’ve often heard,” Pao-yü replied, “that writers of old opine that it’s\nbetter to quote an old saying than to compose a new one; and that an old\nengraving excels in every respect an engraving of the present day.\nWhat’s more, this place doesn’t constitute the main hill or the chief\nfeature of the scenery, and is really no site where any inscription\nshould be put, as it no more than constitutes the first step in the\ninspection of the landscape. Won’t it be well to employ the exact text\nof an old writer consisting of ’a tortuous path leading to a secluded\n(nook).’ This line of past days would, if inscribed, be, in fact,\nliberal to boot.”",
        "After listening to the proposed line, they all sang its praise.\n\"First-rate! excellent!” they cried, “the natural talents of your second\nson, dear friend, are lofty; his mental capacity is astute; he is unlike\nourselves, who have read books but are simple fools.”",
        "“You shouldn’t,” urged Chia Cheng smilingly, “heap upon him excessive\npraise; he’s young in years, and merely knows one thing which he turns\nto the use of ten purposes; you should laugh at him, that’s all; but we\ncan by and by choose some device.”",
        "As he spoke, he entered the cave, where he perceived beautiful trees\nwith thick foliage, quaint flowers in lustrous bloom, while a line of\nlimpid stream emanated out of a deep recess among the flowers and trees,\nand oozed down through the crevice of the rock. Progressing several\nsteps further in, they gradually faced the northern side, where a\nstretch of level ground extended far and wide, on each side of which\nsoared lofty buildings, intruding themselves into the skies, whose\ncarved rafters and engraved balustrades nestled entirely among the\ndepressions of the hills and the tops of the trees. They lowered their\neyes and looked, and beheld a pure stream flowing like jade, stone steps\ntraversing the clouds, a balustrade of white marble encircling the pond\nin its embrace, and a stone bridge with three archways, the animals upon\nwhich had faces disgorging water from their mouths. A pavilion stood on\nthe bridge, and in this pavilion Chia Chen and the whole party went and\nsat.",
        "“Gentlemen,” he inquired, “what shall we write about this?”",
        "“In the record,” they all replied, “of the ’Drunken Old Man’s Pavilion,’\nwritten in days of old by Ou Yang, appears this line: ’There is a\npavilion pinioned-like,’ so let us call this ’the pinioned-like\npavilion,’ and finish.”",
        "“Pinioned-like,” observed Chia Cheng smiling, “is indeed excellent; but\nthis pavilion is constructed over the water, and there should, after\nall, be some allusion to the water in the designation. My humble opinion\nis that of the line in Ou Yang’s work, ’(the water) drips from between\nthe two peaks,’ we should only make use of that single word ’drips.’”",
        "“First-rate!” rejoined one of the visitors, “capital! but what would\nreally be appropriate are the two characters ’dripping jadelike.’”",
        "Chia Chen pulled at his moustache, as he gave way to reflection; after\nwhich, he asked Pao-yü to also propose one himself.",
        "“What you, sir, suggested a while back,” replied Pao-yü, “will do very\nwell; but if we were now to sift the matter thoroughly, the use of the\nsingle word ’drip’ by Ou Yang, in his composition about the Niang\nspring, would appear quite apposite; while the application, also on this\noccasion, to this spring, of the character ’drip’ would be found not\nquite suitable. Moreover, seeing that this place is intended as a\nseparate residence (for the imperial consort), on her visit to her\nparents, it is likewise imperative that we should comply with all the\nprinciples of etiquette, so that were words of this kind to be used,\nthey would besides be coarse and inappropriate; and may it please you to\nfix upon something else more recondite and abstruse.”",
        "“What do you, gentlemen, think of this argument?” Chia Cheng remarked\nsneeringly. “A little while ago, when the whole company devised\nsomething original, you observed that it would be better to quote an old\ndevice; and now that we have quoted an old motto, you again maintain\nthat it’s coarse and inappropriate! But you had better give us one of\nyours.”",
        "“If two characters like ’dripping jadelike’ are to be used,” Pao-yü\nexplained, “it would be better then to employ the two words ’Penetrating\nFragrance,’ which would be unique and excellent, wouldn’t they?”",
        "Chia Cheng pulled his moustache, nodded his head and did not utter a\nword; whereupon the whole party hastily pressed forward with one voice\nto eulogize Pao-yü’s acquirements as extraordinary.",
        "“The selection of two characters for the tablet is an easy matter,\"\nsuggested Chia Cheng, “but now go on and compose a pair of antithetical\nphrases with seven words in each.”",
        "Pao-yü cast a glance round the four quarters, when an idea came into his\nhead, and he went on to recite:",
        "  The willows, which enclose the shore, the green borrow from three\n      bamboos;\n  On banks apart, the flowers asunder grow, yet one perfume they give.",
        "Upon hearing these lines, Chia Cheng gave a faint smile, as he nodded\nhis head, whilst the whole party went on again to be effusive in their\npraise. But forthwith they issued from the pavilions, and crossed the\npond, contemplating with close attention each elevation, each stone,\neach flower, or each tree. And as suddenly they raised their heads, they\ncaught sight, in front of them, of a line of white wall, of numbers of\ncolumns, and beautiful cottages, where flourished hundreds and thousands\nof verdant bamboos, which screened off the rays of the sun.",
        "“What a lovely place!” they one and all exclaimed.",
        "Speedily the whole company penetrated inside, perceiving, as soon as\nthey had entered the gate, a zigzag arcade, below the steps of which was\na raised pathway, laid promiscuously with stones, and on the furthest\npart stood a diminutive cottage with three rooms, two with doors leading\ninto them and one without. Everything in the interior, in the shape of\nbeds, teapoys, chairs and tables, were made to harmonise with the space\navailable. Leading out of the inner room of the cottage was a small door\nfrom which, as they egressed, they found a back-court with lofty pear\ntrees in blossom and banana trees, as well as two very small retiring\nback-courts. At the foot of the wall, unexpectedly became visible an\naperture where was a spring, for which a channel had been opened\nscarcely a foot or so wide, to enable it to run inside the wall. Winding\nround the steps, it skirted the buildings until it reached the front\ncourt, where it coiled and curved, flowing out under the bamboos.",
        "“This spot,” observed Chia Cheng full of smiles, “is indeed pleasant!\nand could one, on a moonlight night, sit under the window and study, one\nwould not spend a whole lifetime in vain!”",
        "As he said this, he quickly cast a glance at Pao-yü, and so terrified\ndid Pao-yü feel that he hastily drooped his head. The whole company lost\nno time in choosing some irrelevant talk to turn the conversation, and\ntwo of the visitors prosecuted their remarks by adding that on the\ntablet, in this spot, four characters should be inscribed.",
        "“Which four characters?” Chia Cheng inquired, laughingly.",
        "“The bequeathed aspect of the river Ch’i!” suggested one of them.",
        "“It’s commonplace,” observed Chia Cheng.",
        "Another person recommended “the remaining vestiges of the Chü Garden.”",
        "“This too is commonplace!” replied Chia Cheng.",
        "“Let brother Pao-yü again propound one!” interposed Chia Chen, who stood\nby.",
        "“Before he composes any himself,” Chia Cheng continued, “his wont is to\nfirst discuss the pros and cons of those of others; so it’s evident that\nhe’s an impudent fellow!”",
        "“He’s most reasonable in his arguments,” all the visitors protested,\n\"and why should he be called to task?”",
        "“Don’t humour him so much!” Chia Cheng expostulated. “I’ll put up for\nto-day,” he however felt constrained to tell Pao-yü, “with your haughty\nmanner, and your rubbishy speech, so that after you have, to begin with,\ngiven us your opinion, you may next compose a device. But tell me, are\nthere any that will do among the mottoes suggested just now by all the\ngentlemen?”",
        "“They all seem to me unsuitable!” Pao-yü did not hesitate to say by way\nof reply to this question.",
        "Chia Cheng gave a sardonic smile. “How all unsuitable?” he exclaimed.",
        "“This,” continued Pao-yü, “is the first spot which her highness will\nhonour on her way, and there should be inscribed, so that it should be\nappropriate, something commending her sacred majesty. But if a tablet\nwith four characters has to be used, there are likewise devices ready at\nhand, written by poets of old; and what need is there to compose any\nmore?”",
        "“Are forsooth the devices ’the river Ch’i and the Chu Garden’ not those\nof old authors?” insinuated Chia Cheng.",
        "“They are too stiff,” replied Pao-yü. “Would not the four characters: ’a\nphoenix comes with dignified air,’ be better?”",
        "With clamorous unanimity the whole party shouted: “Excellent:” and Chia\nCheng nodding his head; “You beast, you beast!” he ejaculated, “it may\nwell be said about you that you see through a thin tube and have no more\njudgment than an insect! Compose another stanza,” he consequently bade\nhim; and Pao-yü recited:",
        "  In the precious tripod kettle, tea is brewed, but green is still the\n      smoke!\n  O’er is the game of chess by the still window, but the fingers are yet\n      cold.",
        "Chia Cheng shook his head. “Neither does this seem to me good!” he said;\nand having concluded this remark he was leading the company out, when\njust as he was about to proceed, he suddenly bethought himself of\nsomething.",
        "“The several courts and buildings and the teapoys, sideboards, tables\nand chairs,” he added, “may be said to be provided for. But there are\nstill all those curtains, screens and portieres, as well as the\nfurniture, nicknacks and curios; and have they too all been matched to\nsuit the requirements of each place?”",
        "“Of the things that have to be placed about,” Chia Chen explained, a\ngood number have, at an early period, been added, and of course when the\ntime comes everything will be suitably arranged. As for the curtains,\nscreens, and portieres, which have to be hung up, I heard yesterday\nbrother Lien say that they are not as yet complete, that when the works\nwere first taken in hand, the plan of each place was drawn, the\nmeasurements accurately calculated and some one despatched to attend to\nthe things, and that he thought that yesterday half of them were bound\nto come in.",
        "Chia Cheng, upon hearing this explanation, readily remembered that with\nall these concerns Chia Chen had nothing to do; so that he speedily sent\nsome one to go and call Chia Lien.",
        "Having arrived in a short while, “How many sorts of things are there in\nall?” Chia Cheng inquired of him. “Of these how many kinds have by this\ntime been got ready? and how many more are short?”",
        "At this question, Chia Lien hastily produced, from the flaps of his\nboot, a paper pocket-book, containing a list, which he kept inside the\ntops of his boot. After perusing it and reperusing it, he made suitable\nreply. “Of the hundred and twenty curtains,” he proceeded, “of stiff\nspotted silks, embroidered with dragons in relief, and of the curtains\nlarge and small, of every kind of damask silk, eighty were got\nyesterday, so that there still remain forty of them to come. The two\nportieres were both received yesterday; and besides these, there are the\ntwo hundred red woollen portieres, two hundred portieres of Hsiang Fei\nbamboo; two hundred door-screens of rattan, with gold streaks, and of\nred lacquered bamboo; two hundred portieres of black lacquered rattan;\ntwo hundred door-screens of variegated thread-netting with clusters of\nflowers. Of each of these kinds, half have come in, but the whole lot of\nthem will be complete no later than autumn. Antimacassars, table-cloths,\nflounces for the beds, and cushions for the stools, there are a thousand\ntwo hundred of each, but these likewise are ready and at hand.”",
        "As he spoke, they proceeded outwards, but suddenly they perceived a hill\nextending obliquely in such a way as to intercept the passage; and as\nthey wound round the curve of the hill faintly came to view a line of\nyellow mud walls, the whole length of which was covered with paddy\nstalks for the sake of protection, and there were several hundreds of\napricot trees in bloom, which presented the appearance of being fire,\nspurted from the mouth, or russet clouds, rising in the air. Inside this\nenclosure, stood several thatched cottages. Outside grew, on the other\nhand, mulberry trees, elms, mallows, and silkworm oaks, whose tender\nshoots and new twigs, of every hue, were allowed to bend and to\nintertwine in such a way as to form two rows of green fence. Beyond this\nfence and below the white mound, was a well, by the side of which stood\na well-sweep, windlass and such like articles; the ground further down\nbeing divided into parcels, and apportioned into fields, which, with the\nfine vegetables and cabbages in flower, presented, at the first glance,\nthe aspect of being illimitable.",
        "“This is,” Chia Cheng observed chuckling, “the place really imbued with\na certain amount of the right principle; and laid out, though it has\nbeen by human labour, yet when it strikes my eye, it so moves my heart,\nthat it cannot help arousing in me the wish to return to my native place\nand become a farmer. But let us enter and rest a while.”",
        "As he concluded these words, they were on the point of walking in, when\nthey unexpectedly discerned a stone, outside the trellis gate, by the\nroadside, which had also been left as a place on which to inscribe a\nmotto.",
        "“Were a tablet,” argued the whole company smilingly, “put up high in a\nspot like this, to be filled up by and by, the rustic aspect of a farm\nwould in that case be completely done away with; and it will be better,\nyea far better to erect this slab on the ground, as it will further make\nmanifest many points of beauty. But unless a motto could be composed of\nthe same excellence as that in Fan Shih-hu’s song on farms, it will not\nbe adequate to express its charms!”",
        "“Gentlemen,” observed Chia Cheng, “please suggest something.”",
        "“A short while back,” replied the whole company, “your son, venerable\nbrother, remarked that devising a new motto was not equal to quoting an\nold one, and as sites of this kind have been already exhausted by\nwriters of days of old, wouldn’t it be as well that we should\nstraightway call it the ’apricot blossom village?’ and this will do\nsplendidly.”",
        "When Chia Cheng heard this remark, he smiled and said, addressing\nhimself to Chia Chen: “This just reminds me that although this place is\nperfect in every respect, there’s still one thing wanting in the shape\nof a wine board; and you had better then have one made to-morrow on the\nvery same pattern as those used outside in villages; and it needn’t be\nanything gaudy, but hung above the top of a tree by means of bamboos.”",
        "Chia Chen assented. “There’s no necessity,” he went on to explain, “to\nkeep any other birds in here, but only to rear a few geese, ducks, fowls\nand such like; as in that case they will be in perfect keeping with the\nplace.”",
        "“A splendid idea!” Chia Cheng rejoined, along with all the party.",
        "“’Apricot blossom village’ is really first-rate,” continued Chia Cheng\nas he again addressed himself to the company; “but the only thing is\nthat it encroaches on the real designation of the village; and it will\nbe as well to wait (until her highness comes), when we can request her\nto give it a name.”",
        "“Certainly!” answered the visitors with one voice; “but now as far as a\nname goes, for mere form, let us all consider what expressions will be\nsuitable to employ.”",
        "Pao-yü did not however give them time to think; nor did he wait for Chia\nCheng’s permission, but suggested there and then: “In old poetical works\nthere’s this passage: ’At the top of the red apricot tree hangs the flag\nof an inn,’ and wouldn’t it be advisable, on this occasion, to\ntemporarily adopt the four words: ’the sign on the apricot tree is\nvisible’?”",
        "“’Is visible’ is excellent,” suggested the whole number of them, “and\nwhat’s more it secretly accords with the meaning implied by ’apricot\nblossom village.’”",
        "“Were the two words ’apricot blossom’ used for the name of the village,\nthey would be too commonplace and unsuitable;” added Pao-yü with a\nsardonic grin, “but there’s another passage in the works of a poet of\nthe T’ang era: ’By the wooden gate near the water the corn-flower emits\nits fragrance;’ and why not make use of the motto ’corn fragrance\nvillage,’ which will be excellent?”",
        "When the company heard his proposal, they, with still greater vigour,\nunanimously combined in crying out “Capital!” as they clapped their\nhands.",
        "Chia Cheng, with one shout, interrupted their cries, “You ignorant child\nof wrath!” he ejaculated; “how many old writers can you know, and how\nmany stanzas of ancient poetical works can you remember, that you will\nhave the boldness to show off in the presence of all these experienced\ngentlemen? (In allowing you to give vent to) all the nonsense you\nuttered my object was no other than to see whether your brain was clear\nor muddled; and all for fun’s sake, that’s all; and lo, you’ve taken\nthings in real earnest!”",
        "Saying this, he led the company into the interior of the hall with the\nmallows. The windows were pasted with paper, and the bedsteads made of\nwood, and all appearance of finery had been expunged, and Chia Cheng’s\nheart was naturally much gratified; but nevertheless, scowling angrily\nat Pao-yü, “What do you think of this place?” he asked.",
        "When the party heard this question, they all hastened to stealthily give\na nudge to Pao-yü, with the express purpose of inducing him to say it\nwas nice; but Pao-yü gave no ear to what they all urged. “It’s by far\nbelow the spot,” he readily replied, “designated ’a phoenix comes with\ndignified air.’”",
        "“You ignorant stupid thing!” exclaimed Chia Cheng at these words; “what\nyou simply fancy as exquisite, with that despicable reliance of yours\nupon luxury and display, are two-storied buildings and painted pillars!\nBut how can you know anything about this aspect so pure and unobtrusive,\nand this is all because of that failing of not studying your books!”",
        "“Sir,” hastily answered Pao-yü, “your injunctions are certainly correct;\r\nbut men of old have often made allusion to ’natural;’ and what is, I\nwonder, the import of these two characters?”",
        "The company had perceived what a perverse mind Pao yü possessed, and\nthey one and all were much surprised that he should be so silly beyond\nthe possibility of any change; and when now they heard the question he\nasked, about the two characters representing “natural,” they, with one\naccord, speedily remarked, “Everything else you understand, and how is\nit that on the contrary you don’t know what ’natural’ implies? The word\n’natural’ means effected by heaven itself and not made by human labour.”",
        "“Well, just so,” rejoined Pao-yü; “but the farm, which is laid out in\nthis locality, is distinctly the handiwork of human labour; in the\ndistance, there are no neighbouring hamlets; near it, adjoin no wastes;\nthough it bears a hill, the hill is destitute of streaks; though it be\nclose to water, this water has no spring; above, there is no pagoda\nnestling in a temple; below, there is no bridge leading to a market; it\nrises abrupt and solitary, and presents no grand sight! The palm would\nseem to be carried by the former spot, which is imbued with the natural\nprinciple, and possesses the charms of nature; for, though bamboos have\nbeen planted in it, and streams introduced, they nevertheless do no\nviolence to the works executed. ’A natural landscape,’ says, an ancient\nauthor in four words; and why? Simply because he apprehended that what\nwas not land, would, by forcible ways, be converted into land; and that\nwhat was no hill would, by unnatural means, be raised into a hill. And\ningenious though these works might be in a hundred and one ways, they\ncannot, after all, be in harmony.”...",
        "But he had no time to conclude, as Chia Cheng flew into a rage. “Drive\nhim off,” he shouted; (but as Pao-yü) was on the point of going out, he\nagain cried out: “Come back! make up,” he added, “another couplet, and\nif it isn’t clear, I’ll for all this give you a slap on your mouth.”",
        "Pao-yü had no alternative but to recite as follows:",
        "  A spot in which the “Ko” fibre to bleach, as the fresh tide doth swell\n      the waters green!\n  A beauteous halo and a fragrant smell the man encompass who the cress\n      did pluck!",
        "Chia Cheng, after this recital, nodded his head. “This is still worse!\"\nhe remarked, but as he reproved him, he led the company outside, and\nwinding past the mound, they penetrated among flowers, and wending their\nsteps by the willows, they touched the rocks and lingered by the stream.\nPassing under the trellis with yellow roses, they went into the shed\nwith white roses; they crossed by the pavilion with peonies, and walked\nthrough the garden, where the white peony grew; and entering the court\nwith the cinnamon roses, they reached the island of bananas. As they\nmeandered and zigzagged, suddenly they heard the rustling sound of the\nwater, as it came out from a stone cave, from the top of which grew\nparasitic plants drooping downwards, while at its bottom floated the\nfallen flowers.",
        "“What a fine sight!” they all exclaimed; “what beautiful scenery!”",
        "“Gentlemen,” observed Chia Cheng, “what name do you propose for this\nplace?”",
        "“There’s no further need for deliberation,” the company rejoined; “for\nthis is just the very spot fit for the three words ’Wu Ling Spring.’”",
        "“This too is matter-of-fact!” Chia Cheng objected laughingly, “and\nlikewise antiquated.”",
        "“If that won’t do,” the party smiled, “well then what about the four\ncharacters implying ’An old cottage of a man of the Ch’in dynasty?’”",
        "“This is still more exceedingly plain!” interposed Pao-yü. “’The old\ncottage of a man of the Ch’in dynasty’ is meant to imply a retreat from\nrevolution, and how will it suit this place? Wouldn’t the four\ncharacters be better denoting ’an isthmus with smart weed, and a stream\nwith flowers’?”",
        "When Chia Cheng heard these words, he exclaimed: “You’re talking still\nmore stuff and nonsense?” and forthwith entering the grotto, Chia Cheng\nwent on to ask of Chia Chen, “Are there any boats or not?”",
        "“There are to be,” replied Chia Chen, “four boats in all from which to\npick the lotus, and one boat for sitting in; but they haven’t now as yet\nbeen completed.”",
        "“What a pity!” Chia Cheng answered smilingly, “that we cannot go in.”",
        "“But we could also get into it by the tortuous path up the hill,” Chia\nChen ventured; and after finishing this remark, he walked ahead to show\nthe way, and the whole party went over, holding on to the creepers, and\nsupporting themselves by the trees, when they saw a still larger\nquantity of fallen leaves on the surface of the water, and the stream\nitself, still more limpid, gently and idly meandering along on its\ncircuitous course. By the bank of the pond were two rows of weeping\nwillows, which, intermingling with peach and apricot trees, screened the\nheavens from view, and kept off the rays of the sun from this spot,\nwhich was in real truth devoid of even a grain of dust.",
        "Suddenly, they espied in the shade of the willows, an arched wooden\nbridge also reveal itself to the eye, with bannisters of vermilion\ncolour. They crossed the bridge, and lo, all the paths lay open before\nthem; but their gaze was readily attracted by a brick cottage spotless\nand cool-looking; whose walls were constructed of polished bricks, of\nuniform colour; (whose roof was laid) with speckless tiles; and whose\nenclosing walls were painted; while the minor slopes, which branched off\nfrom the main hill, all passed along under the walls on to the other\nside.",
        "“This house, in a site like this, is perfectly destitute of any charm!\"\nadded Chia Cheng.",
        "And as they entered the door, abruptly appeared facing them, a large\nboulder studded with holes and soaring high in the skies, which was\nsurrounded on all four sides by rocks of every description, and\ncompletely, in fact, hid from view the rooms situated in the compound.\nBut of flowers or trees, there was not even one about; and all that was\nvisible were a few strange kinds of vegetation; some being of the\ncreeper genus, others parasitic plants, either hanging from the apex of\nthe hill, or inserting themselves into the base of the rocks; drooping\ndown even from the eaves of the house, entwining the pillars, and\nclosing round the stone steps. Or like green bands, they waved and\nflapped; or like gold thread, they coiled and bent, either with seeds\nresembling cinnabar, or with blossoms like golden olea; whose fragrance\nand aroma could not be equalled by those emitted by flowers of ordinary\nspecies.",
        "“This is pleasant!” Chia Cheng could not refrain from saying; “the only\nthing is that I don’t know very much about flowers.”",
        "“What are here are lianas and ficus pumila!” some of the company\nobserved.",
        "“How ever can the liana and the ficus have such unusual scent?\"\nquestioned Chia Cheng.",
        "“Indeed they aren’t!” interposed Pao-yü. “Among all these flowers, there\nare also ficus and liana, but those scented ones are iris, ligularia,\nand ’Wu’ flowers; that kind consist, for the most part, of ’Ch’ih’\nflowers and orchids; while this mostly of gold-coloured dolichos. That\nspecies is the hypericum plant, this the ’Yü Lu’ creeper. The red ones\nare, of course, the purple rue; the green ones consist for certain, of\nthe green ’Chih’ plant; and, to the best of my belief, these various\nplants are mentioned in the ’Li Sao’ and ’Wen Hsuan.’ These rare plants\nare, some of them called something or other like ’Huo Na’ and ’Chiang\nHui;’ others again are designated something like ’Lun Tsu’ and ’Tz’u\nFeng;’ while others there are whose names sound like ’Shih Fan,’ ’Shui\nSung’ and ’Fu Liu,’ which together with other species are to be found in\nthe ’Treatise about the Wu city’ by Tso T’ai-chung. There are also those\nwhich go under the appellation of ’Lu T’i,’ or something like that;\nwhile there are others that are called something or other like ’Tan\nChiao,’ ’Mi Wu’ and ’Feng Lien;’ reference to which is made in the\n’Treatise on the Shu city.’ But so many years have now elapsed, and the\ntimes have so changed (since these treatises were written), that people,\nbeing unable to discriminate (the real names) may consequently have had\nto appropriate in every case such names as suited the external aspect,\nso that they may, it is quite possible, have gradually come to be called\nby wrong designations.”",
        "But he had no time to conclude; for Chia Cheng interrupted him. “Who has\never asked you about it?” he shouted; which plunged Pao-yü into such a\nfright, that he drew back, and did not venture to utter another word.",
        "Chia Cheng perceiving that on both sides alike were covered passages\nresembling outstretched arms, forthwith continued his steps and entered\nthe covered way, when he caught sight, at the upper end, of a\nfive-roomed building, without spot or blemish, with folding blinds\nextending in a connected line, and with corridors on all four sides; (a\nbuilding) which with its windows so green, and its painted walls,\nexcelled, in spotless elegance, the other buildings they had seen\nbefore, to which it presented such a contrast.",
        "Chia Cheng heaved a sigh. “If one were able,” he observed, “to boil his\ntea and thrum his lyre in here, there wouldn’t even be any need for him\nto burn any more incense. But the execution of this structure is so\nbeyond conception that you must, gentlemen, compose something nice and\noriginal to embellish the tablet with, so as not to render such a place\nof no effect!”",
        "“There’s nothing so really pat,” suggested the company smiling; “as ’the\norchid-smell-laden breeze’ and ’the dew-bedecked epidendrum!”",
        "“These are indeed the only four characters,” rejoined Chia Cheng, “that\ncould be suitably used; but what’s to be said as far as the scroll\ngoes?”",
        "“I’ve thought of a couplet,” interposed one of the party, “which you’ll\nall have to criticise, and put into ship-shape; its burden is this:",
        " “The musk-like epidendrum smell enshrouds the court, where shines the\n      sun with oblique beams;\n  The iris fragrance is wafted over the isle illumined by the moon’s\n      clear rays.”",
        "“As far as excellence is concerned, it’s excellent,” observed the whole\nparty, “but the two words representing ’with oblique beams’ are not\nfelicitous.”",
        "And as some one quoted the line from an old poem:",
        "  The angelica fills the court with tears, what time the sun doth slant.",
        "“Lugubrious, lugubrious!” expostulated the company with one voice.",
        "Another person then interposed. “I also have a couplet, whose merits\nyou, gentlemen, can weigh; it runs as follows:",
        " “Along the three pathways doth float the Yü Hui scented breeze!\n  The radiant moon in the whole hall shines on the gold orchid!”",
        "Chia Cheng tugged at his moustache and gave way to meditation. He was\njust about also to suggest a stanza, when, upon suddenly raising his\nhead, he espied Pao-yü standing by his side, too timid to give vent to a\nsingle sound.",
        "“How is it,” he purposely exclaimed, “that when you should speak, you\ncontrariwise don’t? Is it likely that you expect some one to request you\nto confer upon us the favour of your instruction?”",
        "“In this place,” Pao-yü rejoined at these words, “there are no such\nthings as orchids, musk, resplendent moon or islands; and were one to\nbegin quoting such specimens of allusions, to scenery, two hundred\ncouplets could be readily given without, even then, having been able to\nexhaust the supply!”",
        "“Who presses your head down,” Chia Cheng urged, “and uses force that you\nmust come out with all these remarks?”",
        "“Well, in that case,” added Pao-yü, “there are no fitter words to put on\nthe tablet than the four representing: ’The fragrance pure of the\nligularia and iris.’ While the device on the scroll might be:",
        " “Sung is the nutmeg song, but beauteous still is the sonnet!\n  Near the T’u Mei to sleep, makes e’en a dream with fragrance full!”",
        "“This is,” laughed Chia Cheng sneeringly, “an imitation of the line:",
        " “A book when it is made of plaintain leaves, the writing green is also\n      bound to be!",
        "“So that there’s nothing remarkable about it.”",
        "“Li T’ai-po, in his work on the Phoenix Terrace,” protested the whole\nparty, “copied, in every point, the Huang Hua Lou. But what’s essential\nis a faultless imitation. Now were we to begin to criticise minutely the\ncouplet just cited, we would indeed find it to be, as compared with the\nline ’A book when it is made of plantain leaves,’ still more elegant and\nof wider application!”",
        "“What an idea?” observed Chia Cheng derisively.",
        "But as he spoke, the whole party walked out; but they had not gone very\nfar before they caught sight of a majestic summer house, towering high\npeak-like, and of a structure rising loftily with storey upon storey;\nand completely locked in as they were on every side they were as\nbeautiful as the Jade palace. Far and wide, road upon road coiled and\nwound; while the green pines swept the eaves, the jady epidendrum\nencompassed the steps, the animals’ faces glistened like gold, and the\ndragons’ heads shone resplendent in their variegated hues.",
        "“This is the Main Hall,” remarked Chia Cheng; “the only word against it\nis that there’s a little too much finery.”",
        "“It should be so,” rejoined one and all, “so as to be what it’s intended\nto be! The imperial consort has, it is true, an exalted preference for\neconomy and frugality, but her present honourable position requires the\nobservance of such courtesies, so that (finery) is no fault.”",
        "As they made these remarks and advanced on their way the while, they\nperceived, just in front of them, an archway project to view,\nconstructed of jadelike stone; at the top of which the coils of large\ndragons and the scales of small dragons were executed in perforated\nstyle.",
        "“What’s the device to be for this spot?” inquired Chia Cheng.",
        "“It should be ’fairy land,’” suggested all of them, “so as to be\napposite!”",
        "Chia Cheng nodded his head and said nothing. But as soon as Pao-yü\ncaught sight of this spot something was suddenly aroused in his heart\nand he began to ponder within himself. “This place really resembles\nsomething that I’ve seen somewhere or other.” But he could not at the\nmoment recall to mind what year, moon, or day this had happened.",
        "Chia Cheng bade him again propose a motto; but Pao-yü was bent upon\nthinking over the details of the scenery he had seen on a former\noccasion, and gave no thought whatever to this place, so that the whole\ncompany were at a loss what construction to give to his silence, and\ncame simply to the conclusion that, after the bullying he had had to put\nup with for ever so long, his spirits had completely vanished, his\ntalents become exhausted and his speech impoverished; and that if he\nwere harassed and pressed, he might perchance, as the result of anxiety,\ncontract some ailment or other, which would of course not be a suitable\nissue, and they lost no time in combining together to dissuade Chia\nCheng.",
        "“Never mind,” they said, “to-morrow will do to compose some device;\nlet’s drop it now.”",
        "Chia Cheng himself was inwardly afraid lest dowager lady Chia should be\nanxious, so that he hastily remarked as he forced a smile. “You beast,\nthere are, after all, also occasions on which you are no good! but never\nmind! I’ll give you one day to do it in, and if by to-morrow you haven’t\nbeen able to compose anything, I shall certainly not let you off. This\nis the first and foremost place and you must exercise due care in what\nyou write.”",
        "Saying this, he sallied out, at the head of the company, and cast\nanother glance at the scenery.",
        "Indeed from the time they had entered the gate up to this stage, they\nhad just gone over five or six tenths of the whole ground, when it\nhappened again that a servant came and reported that some one had\narrived from Mr. Yü-’ts’un’s to deliver a message. “These several places\n(which remain),” Chia Cheng observed with a smile, “we have no time to\npass under inspection; but we might as well nevertheless go out at least\nby that way, as we shall be able, to a certain degree, to have a look at\nthe general aspect.”",
        "With these words, he showed the way for the family companions until they\nreached a large bridge, with water entering under it, looking like a\ncurtain made of crystal. This bridge, the fact is, was the dam, which\ncommunicated with the river outside, and from which the stream was\nintroduced into the grounds.",
        "“What’s the name of this water-gate?” Chia Cheng inquired.",
        "“This is,” replied Pao-yü, “the main stream of the Hsin Fang river, and\nis therefore called the Hsin Fang water-gate.”",
        "“Nonsense!” exclaimed Chia Cheng. “The two words Hsin Fang must on no\naccount be used!”",
        "And as they speedily advanced on their way, they either came across\nelegant halls, or thatched cottages; walls made of piled-up stone, or\ngates fashioned of twisted plants; either a secluded nunnery or Buddhist\nfane, at the foot of some hill; or some unsullied houses, hidden in a\ngrove, tenanted by rationalistic priestesses; either extensive corridors\nand winding grottoes; or square buildings, and circular pavilions. But\nChia Cheng had not the energy to enter any of these places, for as he\nhad not had any rest for ever so long, his legs felt shaky and his feet\nweak.",
        "Suddenly they also discerned ahead of them a court disclose itself to\nview.",
        "“When we get there,” Chia Cheng suggested, “we must have a little rest.\"\nStraightway as he uttered the remark, he led them in, and winding round\nthe jade-green peach-trees, covered with blossom, they passed through\nthe bamboo fence and flower-laden hedge, which were twisted in such a\nway as to form a circular, cavelike gateway, when unexpectedly appeared\nbefore their eyes an enclosure with whitewashed walls, in which verdant\nwillows drooped in every direction.",
        "Chia Cheng entered the gateway in company with the whole party. Along\nthe whole length of both sides extended covered passages, connected with\neach other; while in the court were laid out several rockeries. In one\nquarter were planted a number of banana trees; on the opposite stood a\nplant of begonia from Hsi Fu. Its appearance was like an open umbrella.\nThe gossamer hanging (from its branches) resembled golden threads. The\ncorollas (seemed) to spurt out cinnabar.",
        "“What a beautiful flower! what a beautiful flower!” ejaculated the whole\nparty with one voice; “begonias are verily to be found; but never before\nhave we seen anything the like of this in beauty.”",
        "“This is called the maiden begonia and is, in fact, a foreign species,\"\nChia Cheng observed. “There’s a homely tradition that it is because it\nemanates from the maiden kingdom that its flowers are most prolific; but\nthis is likewise erratic talk and devoid of common sense.”",
        "“They are, after all,” rejoined the whole company, “so unlike others (we\nhave seen), that what’s said about the maiden kingdom is, we are\ninclined to believe, possibly a fact.”",
        "“I presume,” interposed Pao-yü, “that some clever bard or poet,\n(perceiving) that this flower was red like cosmetic, delicate as if\npropped up in sickness, and that it closely resembled the nature of a\nyoung lady, gave it, consequently, the name of maiden! People in the\nworld will propagate idle tales, all of which are unavoidably treated as\ngospel!”",
        "“We receive (with thanks) your instructions; what excellent\nexplanation!” they all remarked unanimously, and as they expressed these\nwords, the whole company took their seats on the sofas under the\ncolonnade.",
        "“Let’s think of some original text or other for a motto,” Chia Cheng\nhaving suggested, one of the companions opined that the two characters:\n\"Banana and stork” would be felicitous; while another one was of the\nidea that what would be faultless would be: “Collected splendour and\r\nwaving elegance!”",
        "“’Collected splendour and waving elegance’ is excellent,” Chia Cheng\nobserved addressing himself to the party; and Pao-yü himself, while also\nextolling it as beautiful, went on to say: “There’s only one thing\nhowever to be regretted!”",
        "“What about regret?” the company inquired.",
        "“In this place,” Pao-yü explained, “are set out both bananas as well as\nbegonias, with the intent of secretly combining in them the two\nproperties of red and green; and if mention of one of them be made, and\nthe other be omitted, (the device) won’t be good enough for selection.”",
        "“What would you then suggest?” Chia Cheng asked.",
        "“I would submit the four words, ’the red (flowers) are fragrant, the\ngreen (banana leaves) like jade,’ which would render complete the\nbeauties of both (the begonias and bananas).”",
        "“It isn’t good! it isn’t good!” Chia Cheng remonstrated as he shook his\nhead; and while passing this remark, he conducted the party into the\nhouse, where they noticed that the internal arrangements effected\ndiffered from those in other places, as no partitions could, in fact, be\ndiscerned. Indeed, the four sides were all alike covered with boards\ncarved hollow with fretwork, (in designs consisting) either of rolling\nclouds and hundreds of bats; or of the three friends of the cold season\nof the year, (fir, bamboo and almond); of scenery and human beings, or\nof birds or flowers; either of clusters of decoration, or of relics of\nolden times; either of ten thousand characters of happiness or of ten\nthousand characters of longevity. The various kinds of designs had been\nall carved by renowned hands, in variegated colours, inlaid with gold,\nand studded with precious gems; while on shelf upon shelf were either\r\narranged collections of books, or tripods were laid out; either pens and\ninkslabs were distributed about, or vases with flowers set out, or\nfigured pots were placed about; the designs of the shelves being either\nround or square; or similar to sunflowers or banana leaves; or like\r\nlinks, half overlapping each other. And in very truth they resembled\nbouquets of flowers or clusters of tapestry, with all their fretwork so\ntransparent. Suddenly (the eye was struck) by variegated gauzes pasted\n(on the wood-work), actually forming small windows; and of a sudden by\nfine thin silks lightly overshadowing (the fretwork) just as if there\nwere, after all, secret doors. The whole walls were in addition traced,\nwith no regard to symmetry, with outlines of the shapes of curios and\nnick-nacks in imitation of lutes, double-edged swords, hanging bottles\nand the like, the whole number of which, though (apparently) suspended\non the walls, were all however on a same level with the surface of the\npartition walls.",
        "“What fine ingenuity!” they all exclaimed extollingly; “what a labour\nthey must have been to carry out!”",
        "Chia Cheng had actually stepped in; but scarcely had they reached the\nsecond stage, before the whole party readily lost sight of the way by\nwhich they had come in. They glanced on the left, and there stood a\ndoor, through which they could go. They cast their eyes on the right,\nand there was a window which suddenly impeded their progress. They went\nforward, but there again they were obstructed by a bookcase. They turned\ntheir heads round, and there too stood windows pasted with transparent\ngauze and available door-ways: but the moment they came face to face\nwith the door, they unexpectedly perceived that a whole company of\npeople had likewise walked in, just in front of them, whose appearance\nresembled their own in every respect. But it was only a mirror. And when\nthey rounded the mirror, they detected a still larger number of doors.",
        "“Sir,” Chia Chen remarked with a grin; “if you’ll follow me out through\nthis door, we’ll forthwith get into the back-court; and once out of the\nback-court, we shall be, at all events, nearer than we were before.”",
        "Taking the lead, he conducted Chia Cheng and the whole party round two\ngauze mosquito houses, when they verily espied a door through which they\nmade their exit, into a court, replete with stands of cinnamon roses.\nPassing round the flower-laden hedge, the only thing that spread before\ntheir view was a pure stream impeding their advance. The whole company\nwas lost in admiration. “Where does this water again issue from?” they\ncried.",
        "Chia Chen pointed to a spot at a distance. “Starting originally,” he\nexplained, “from that water-gate, it runs as far as the mouth of that\ncave, when from among the hills on the north-east side, it is introduced\ninto that village, where again a diverging channel has been opened and\nit is made to flow in a south-westerly direction; the whole volume of\nwater then runs to this spot, where collecting once more in one place,\nit issues, on its outward course, from beneath that wall.”",
        "“It’s most ingenious!” they one and all exclaimed, after they had\nlistened to him; but, as they uttered these words, they unawares\nrealised that a lofty hill obstructed any further progress. The whole\nparty felt very hazy about the right road. But “Come along after me,\"\nChia Chen smilingly urged, as he at once went ahead and showed the way,\nwhereupon the company followed in his steps, and as soon as they turned\nround the foot of the hill, a level place and broad road lay before\nthem; and wide before their faces appeared the main entrance.",
        "“This is charming! this is delightful!” the party unanimously exclaimed,\n\"what wits must have been ransacked, and ingenuity attained, so as to\nbring things to this extreme degree of excellence!”",
        "Forthwith the party egressed from the garden, and Pao-yü’s heart\nanxiously longed for the society of the young ladies in the inner\nquarters, but as he did not hear Chia Cheng bid him go, he had no help\nbut to follow him into the library. But suddenly Chia Cheng bethought\nhimself of him. “What,” he said, “you haven’t gone yet! the old lady\nwill I fear be anxious on your account; and is it pray that you haven’t\nas yet had enough walking?”",
        "Pao-yü at length withdrew out of the library. On his arrival in the\ncourt, a page, who had been in attendance on Chia Cheng, at once pressed\nforward, and took hold of him fast in his arms. “You’ve been lucky\nenough,” he said, “to-day to have been in master’s good graces! just a\nwhile back when our old mistress despatched servants to come on several\noccasions and ask after you, we replied that master was pleased with\nyou; for had we given any other answer, her ladyship would have sent to\nfetch you to go in, and you wouldn’t have had an opportunity of\ndisplaying your talents. Every one admits that the several stanzas you\nrecently composed were superior to those of the whole company put\ntogether; but you must, after the good luck you’ve had to-day, give us a\ntip!”",
        "“I’ll give each one of you a tiao,” Pao-yü rejoined smirkingly.",
        "“Who of us hasn’t seen a tiao?” they all exclaimed, “let’s have that\npurse of yours, and have done with it!”",
        "Saying this, one by one advanced and proceeded to unloosen the purse,\nand to unclasp the fan-case; and allowing Pao-yü no time to make any\nremonstrance, they stripped him of every ornament in the way of\nappendage which he carried about on his person. “Whatever we do let’s\nescort him home!” they shouted, and one after another hustled round him\nand accompanied him as far as dowager lady Chia’s door.",
        "Her ladyship was at this moment awaiting his arrival, so that when she\nsaw him walk in, and she found out that (Chia Cheng) had not bullied\nhim, she felt, of course, extremely delighted. But not a long interval\nelapsed before Hsi Jen came to serve the tea; and when she perceived\nthat on his person not one of the ornaments remained, she consequently\nsmiled and inquired: “Have all the things that you had on you been again\ntaken away by these barefaced rascals?”",
        "As soon as Lin Tai-yü heard this remark, she crossed over to him and saw\nat a glance that not one single trinket was, in fact, left. “Have you\nalso given them,” she felt constrained to ask, “the purse that I gave\nyou? Well, by and by, when you again covet anything of mine, I shan’t\nlet you have it.”",
        "After uttering these words, she returned into her apartment in high\ndudgeon, and taking the scented bag, which Pao-yü had asked her to make\nfor him, and which she had not as yet finished, she picked up a pair of\nscissors, and instantly cut it to pieces.",
        "Pao-yü noticing that she had lost her temper, came after her with\nhurried step, but the bag had already been cut with the scissors; and as\nPao-yü observed how extremely fine and artistic this scented bag was, in\nspite of its unfinished state, he verily deplored that it should have\nbeen rent to pieces for no rhyme or reason. Promptly therefore\nunbuttoning his coat, he produced from inside the lapel the purse, which\nhad been fastened there. “Look at this!” he remarked as he handed it to\nTai-yü; “what kind of thing is this! have I given away to any one what\nwas yours?” Lin Tai-yü, upon seeing how much he prized it as to wear it\nwithin his clothes, became alive to the fact that it was done with\nintent, as he feared lest any one should take it away; and as this\nconviction made her sorry that she had been so impetuous as to have cut\nthe scented bag, she lowered her head and uttered not a word.",
        "“There was really no need for you to have cut it,” Pao-yü observed; “but\nas I know that you’re loth to give me anything, what do you say to my\nreturning even this purse?”",
        "With these words, he threw the purse in her lap and walked off; which\nvexed Tai-yü so much the more that, after giving way to tears, she took\nup the purse in her hands to also destroy it with the scissors, when\nPao-yü precipitately turned round and snatched it from her grasp.",
        "“My dear cousin,” he smilingly pleaded, “do spare it!” and as Tai-yü\ndashed down the scissors and wiped her tears: “You needn’t,” she urged,\n\"be kind to me at one moment, and unkind at another; if you wish to have\na tiff, why then let’s part company!” But as she spoke, she lost control\nover her temper, and, jumping on her bed, she lay with her face turned\ntowards the inside, and set to work drying her eyes.",
        "Pao-yü could not refrain from approaching her. “My dear cousin, my own\ncousin,” he added, “I confess my fault!”",
        "“Go and find Pao-yü!” dowager lady Chia thereupon gave a shout from\nwhere she was in the front apartment, and all the attendants explained\nthat he was in Miss Lin’s room.",
        "“All right, that will do! that will do!” her ladyship rejoined, when she\nheard this reply; “let the two cousins play together; his father kept\nhim a short while back under check, for ever so long, so let him have\nsome distraction. But the only thing is that you mustn’t allow them to\nhave any quarrels.” To which the servants in a body expressed their\nobedience.",
        "Tai-yü, unable to put up with Pao-yü’s importunity, felt compelled to\nrise. “Your object seems to be,” she remarked, “not to let me have any\nrest. If it is, I’ll run away from you.” Saying which, she there and\nthen was making her way out, when Pao-yü protested with a face full of\nsmiles: “Wherever you go, I’ll follow!” and as he, at the same time,\ntook the purse and began to fasten it on him, Tai-yü stretched out her\nhand, and snatching it away, “You say you don’t want it,” she observed,\n\"and now you put it on again! I’m really much ashamed on your account!\"\nAnd these words were still on her lips when with a sound of Ch’ih, she\nburst out laughing.",
        "“My dear cousin,” Pao-yü added, “to-morrow do work another scented bag\nfor me!”",
        "“That too will rest upon my good pleasure,” Tai-yü rejoined.",
        "As they conversed, they both left the room together and walked into\nmadame Wang’s suite of apartments, where, as luck would have it,\nPao-ch’ai was also seated.",
        "Unusual commotion prevailed, at this time, over at madame Wang’s, for\nthe fact is that Chia Se had already come back from Ku Su, where he had\nselected twelve young girls, and settled about an instructor, as well as\nabout the theatrical properties and the other necessaries. And as Mrs.\nHsüeh had by this date moved her quarters into a separate place on the\nnortheast side, and taken up her abode in a secluded and quiet house,\n(madame Wang) had had repairs of a distinct character executed in the\nPear Fragrance Court, and then issued directions that the instructor\nshould train the young actresses in this place; and casting her choice\nupon all the women, who had, in days of old, received a training in\nsinging, and who were now old matrons with white hair, she bade them\nhave an eye over them and keep them in order. Which done, she enjoined\nChia Se to assume the chief control of all matters connected with the\ndaily and monthly income and outlay, as well as of the accounts of all\narticles in use of every kind and size.",
        "Lin Chih-hsiao also came to report: “that the twelve young nuns and\nTaoist girls, who had been purchased after proper selection, had all\narrived, and that the twenty newly-made Taoist coats had also been\nreceived. That there was besides a maiden, who though devoted to\nasceticism, kept her chevelure unshaved; that she was originally a\ndenizen of Suchow, of a family whose ancestors were also people of\nletters and official status; that as from her youth up she had been\nstricken with much sickness, (her parents) had purchased a good number\nof substitutes (to enter the convent), but all with no relief to her,\nuntil at last this girl herself entered the gate of abstraction when she\nat once recovered. That hence it was that she grew her hair, while she\ndevoted herself to an ascetic life; that she was this year eighteen\nyears of age, and that the name given to her was Miao Yü; that her\nfather and mother were, at this time, already dead; that she had only by\nher side, two old nurses and a young servant girl to wait upon her; that\nshe was most proficient in literature, and exceedingly well versed in\nthe classics and canons; and that she was likewise very attractive as\nfar as looks went; that having heard that in the city of Ch’ang-an,\nthere were vestiges of Kuan Yin and relics of the canons inscribed on\nleaves, she followed, last year, her teacher (to the capital). She now\nlives,” he said, “in the Lao Ni nunnery, outside the western gate; her\nteacher was a great expert in prophetic divination, but she died in the\nwinter of last year, and her dying words were that as it was not\nsuitable for (Miao Yü) to return to her native place, she should await\nhere, as something in the way of a denouement was certain to turn up;\nand this is the reason why she hasn’t as yet borne the coffin back to\nher home!”",
        "“If such be the case,” madame Wang readily suggested, “why shouldn’t we\nbring her here?”",
        "“If we are to ask her,” Lin Chih-hsiao’s wife replied, “she’ll say that\na marquis’ family and a duke’s household are sure, in their honourable\nposition, to be overbearing to people; and I had rather not go.”",
        "“As she’s the daughter of an official family,” madame Wang continued,\n\"she’s bound to be inclined to be somewhat proud; but what harm is there\nto our sending her a written invitation to ask her to come!”",
        "Lin Chih-hsiao’s wife assented; and leaving the room, she made the\nsecretary write an invitation and then went to ask Miao Yü. The next day\nservants were despatched, and carriages and sedan chairs were got ready\nto go and bring her over.",
        "What subsequently transpired is not as yet known, but, reader, listen to\nthe account given in the following chapter.",
        "  His Majesty shows magnanimous bounty.\n  The Imperial consort Yuan pays a visit to her parents.\n  The happiness of a family gathering.\n  Pao-yü displays his polished talents.",
        "But let us resume our story. A servant came, at this moment, to report\nthat for the works in course of execution, they were waiting for gauze\nand damask silk to paste on various articles, and that they requested\nlady Feng to go and open the depôt for them to take the gauze and silk,\nwhile another servant also came to ask lady Feng to open the treasury\nfor them to receive the gold and silver ware. And as Madame Wang, the\nwaiting-maids and the other domestics of the upper rooms had all no\nleisure, Pao-ch’ai suggested: “Don’t let us remain in here and be in the\nway of their doing what there is to be done, and of going where they\nhave to go,” and saying this, she betook herself, escorted by Pao-yü and\nthe rest, into Ying Ch’un’s rooms.",
        "Madame Wang continued day after day in a great state of flurry and\nconfusion, straight up to within the tenth moon, by which time every\narrangement had been completed, and the overseers had all handed in a\nclear statement of their accounts. The curios and writing materials,\nwherever needed, had all already been laid out and everything got ready,\nand the birds (and animals), from the stork, the deer and rabbits to the\nchickens, geese and the like, had all been purchased and handed over to\nbe reared in the various localities in the garden; and over at Chia\nSe’s, had also been learnt twenty miscellaneous plays, while a company\nof young nuns and Taoist priestesses had likewise the whole number of\nthem, mastered the intonation of Buddhist classics and incantations.",
        "Chia Cheng after this, at length, was slightly composed in mind, and\ncheerful at heart; and having further invited dowager lady Chia and\nother inmates to go into the garden, he deliberated with them on, and\nmade arrangements for, every detail in such a befitting manner that not\nthe least trifle remained for which suitable provision had not been\nmade; and Chia Cheng eventually mustered courage to indite a memorial,\nand on the very day on which the memorial was presented, a decree was\nreceived fixing upon the fifteenth day of the first moon of the ensuing\nyear, the very day of the Shang Yuan festival, for the honourable\nconsorts to visit their homes.",
        "Upon the receipt of this decree, with which the Chia family was\nhonoured, they had still less leisure, both by day as well as by night;\nso much so that they could not even properly observe the new year\nfestivities. But in a twinkle of the eye, the festival of the full moon\nof the first moon drew near; and beginning from the eighth day of the\nfirst moon, eunuchs issued from the palace and inspected beforehand the\nvarious localities, the apartments in which the imperial consort was to\nchange her costume; the place where she would spend her leisure moments;\nthe spot where she would receive the conventionalities; the premises\nwhere the banquets would be spread; the quarters where she would retire\nfor rest.",
        "There were also eunuchs who came to assume the patrol of the grounds and\nthe direction of the defences; and they brought along with them a good\nmany minor eunuchs, whose duty it was to look after the safety of the\nvarious localities, to screen the place with enclosing curtains, to\ninstruct the inmates and officials of the Chia mansion whither to go out\nand whence to come in from, what side the viands should be brought in\nfrom, where to report matters, and in the observance of every kind of\netiquette; and for outside the mansion, there were, on the other hand,\nofficers from the Board of Works, and a superintendent of the Police, of\nthe “Five Cities,” in charge of the sweeping of the streets and roads,\nand the clearing away of loungers. While Chia She and the others\nsuperintended the workmen in such things as the manufacture of flowered\nlanterns and fireworks.",
        "The fourteenth day arrived and everything was in order; but on this\nnight, one and all whether high or low, did not get a wink of sleep; and\nwhen the fifteenth came, every one, at the fifth watch, beginning from\ndowager lady Chia and those who enjoyed any official status, appeared in\nfull gala dress, according to their respective ranks. In the garden, the\ncurtains were, by this time, flapping like dragons, the portieres flying\nabout like phoenixes with variegated plumage. Gold and silver glistened\nwith splendour. Pearls and precious gems shed out their brilliant\nlustre. The tripod censers burnt the Pai-ho incense. In the vases were\nplaced evergreens. Silence and stillness prevailed, and not a man\nventured so much as to cough.",
        "Chia She and the other men were standing outside the door giving on to\nthe street on the west; and old lady Chia and the other ladies were\noutside the main entrance of the Jung mansion at the head of the street,\nwhile at the mouth of the lane were placed screens to rigorously\nobstruct the public gaze. They were unable to bear the fatigue of any\nfurther waiting when, at an unexpected moment, a eunuch arrived on\nhorseback, and Chia Cheng went up to meet him, and ascertained what\ntidings he was the bearer of.",
        "“It’s as yet far too early,” rejoined the eunuch, “for at one o’clock\n(her highness) will have her evening repast, and at two she has to\nbetake herself to the Palace of Precious Perception to worship Buddha.\nAt five, she will enter the Palace of Great Splendour to partake of a\nbanquet, and to see the lanterns, after which, she will request His\nMajesty’s permission; so that, I’m afraid, it won’t be earlier than\nseven before they set out.”",
        "Lady Feng’s ear caught what was said. “If such be the case,” she\ninterposed, “may it please your venerable ladyship, and you, my lady, to\nreturn for a while to your apartments, and wait; and if you come when\nit’s time you’ll be here none too late.”",
        "Dowager lady Chia and the other ladies immediately left for a time and\nsuited their own convenience, and as everything in the garden devolved\nupon lady Feng to supervise, she ordered the butlers to take the eunuchs\nand give them something to eat and drink; and at the same time, she sent\nword that candles should be brought in and that the lanterns in the\nvarious places should be lit.",
        "But unexpectedly was heard from outside the continuous patter of horses\nrunning, whereupon about ten eunuchs hurried in gasping and out of\nbreath. They clapped their hands, and the several eunuchs (who had come\nbefore), understanding the signal, and knowing that the party had\narrived, stood in their respective positions; while Chia She, at the\nhead of all the men of the clan, remained at the western street door,\nand dowager lady Chia, at the head of the female relatives of the\nfamily, waited outside the principal entrance to do the honours.",
        "For a long interval, everything was plunged in silence and quiet; when\nsuddenly two eunuchs on horseback were espied advancing with leisurely\nstep. Reaching the western street gate, they dismounted, and, driving\ntheir horses beyond the screens, they forthwith took their stand facing\nthe west. After another long interval, a second couple arrived, and went\nlikewise through the same proceedings. In a short time, drew near about\nten couples, when, at length, were heard the gentle strains of music,\nand couple by couple advanced with banners, dragons, with fans made with\nphoenix feathers, and palace flabella of pheasant plumes; and those\nbesides who carried gold-washed censers burning imperial incense. Next\nin order was brought past a state umbrella of golden yellow, with\ncrooked handle and embroidered with seven phoenixes; after which quickly\nfollowed the crown, robe, girdle and shoes.",
        "There were likewise eunuchs, who took a part in the procession, holding\nscented handkerchiefs and embroidered towels, cups for rinsing the\nmouth, dusters and other such objects; and company after company went\npast, when, at the rear, approached with stately step eight eunuchs\ncarrying an imperial sedan chair, of golden yellow, with a gold knob and\nembroidered with phoenixes.",
        "Old lady Chia and the other members of the family hastily fell on their\nknees, but a eunuch came over at once to raise her ladyship and the\nrest; and the imperial chair was thereupon carried through the main\nentrance, the ceremonial gate and into a court on the eastern side, at\nthe door of which stood a eunuch, who prostrated himself and invited\n(her highness) to dismount and change her costume.",
        "Having forthwith carried her inside the gate, the eunuchs dispersed; and\nonly the maids-of-honour and ladies-in-waiting ushered Yuan Ch’un out of\nthe chair, when what mainly attracted her eye in the park was the\nbrilliant lustre of the flowered lamps of every colour, all of which\nwere made of gauze or damask, and were beautiful in texture, and out of\nthe common run; while on the upper side was a flat lantern with the\ninscription in four characters, “Regarded (by His Majesty’s) benevolence\nand permeated by his benefits.”",
        "Yuan Ch’un entered the apartment and effected the necessary changes in\nher toilette; after which, she again egressed, and, mounting her chair,\nshe made her entry into the garden, when she perceived the smoke of\nincense whirling and twirling, and the reflection of the flowers\nconfusing the eyes. Far and wide, the rays of light, shed by the\nlanterns, intermingled their brilliancy, while, from time to time, fine\nstrains of music sounded with clamorous din. But it would be impossible\nto express adequately the perfect harmony in the aspect of this scene,\nand the grandeur of affluence and splendour.",
        "The imperial consort of the Chia family, we must now observe, upon\ncatching sight, from the interior of her chair, of the picture presented\nwithin as well as without the confines of this garden, shook her head\nand heaved a sigh. “What lavish extravagance! What excessive waste!” she\nsoliloquised.",
        "But of a sudden was again seen a eunuch who, on his knees, invited her\nto get into a boat; and the Chia consort descended from the chair and\nstepped into the craft, when the expanse of a limpid stream met her\ngaze, whose grandeur resembled that of the dragon in its listless\ncourse. The stone bannisters, on each side, were one mass of air-tight\nlanterns, of every colour, made of crystal or glass, which threw out a\nlight like the lustre of silver or the brightness of snow.",
        "The willow, almond and the whole lot of trees, on the upper side, were,\nit is true, without blossom and leaves; but pongee and damask silks,\npaper and lustring had been employed, together with rice-paper, to make\nflowers of, which had been affixed on the branches. Upon each tree were\nsuspended thousands of lanterns; and what is more, the lotus and aquatic\nplants, the ducks and water fowl in the pond had all, in like manner,\nbeen devised out of conches and clams, plumes and feathers. The various\nlanterns, above and below, vied in refulgence. In real truth, it was a\ncrystal region, a world of pearls and precious stones. On board the boat\nwere also every kind of lanterns representing such designs as are used\non flower-pots, pearl-laden portieres, embroidered curtains, oars of\ncinnamon wood, and paddles of magnolia, which need not of course be\nminutely described.",
        "They entered a landing with a stone curb; and on this landing was\nerected a flat lantern upon which were plainly visible the four\ncharacters the “Persicary beach and flower-laden bank.” But, reader, you\nhave heard how that these four characters “the persicary beach and the\nflower-laden bank,” the motto “a phoenix comes with dignified air,” and\nthe rest owe one and all their origin to the unexpected test to which\nChia Cheng submitted, on a previous occasion, Pao-yü’s literary\nabilities; but how did it come about that they were actually adopted?",
        "You must remember that the Chia family had been, generation after\ngeneration, given to the study of letters, so that it was only natural\nthat there should be among them one or two renowned writers of verses;\nfor how could they ever resemble the families of such upstarts, who only\nemploy puerile expressions as a makeshift to get through what they have\nto do? But the why and the wherefore must be sought in the past. The\nconsort, belonging to the Chia mansion, had, before she entered the\npalace, been, from her infancy, also brought up by dowager lady Chia;\nand when Pao-yü was subsequently added to the family, she was the eldest\nsister and Pao-yü the youngest child. The Chia consort, bearing in mind\nhow that she had, when her mother was verging on old age, at length\nobtained this younger brother, she for this reason doated upon him with\nsingle love; and as they were besides companions in their attendance\nupon old lady Chia, they were inseparable for even a moment. Before\nPao-yü had entered school, and when three or four years of age, he had\nalready received oral instruction from the imperial spouse Chia from the\ncontents of several books and had committed to memory several thousands\nof characters, for though they were only sister and brother, they were\nlike mother and child. And after she had entered the Palace, she was\nwont time and again to have letters taken out to her father and her\ncousins, urgently recommending them to be careful with his bringing up,\nthat if they were not strict, he could not possibly become good for\nanything, and that if they were immoderately severe, there was the\ndanger of something unpropitious befalling him, with the result,\nmoreover, that his grandmother would be stricken with sorrow; and this\nsolicitude on his account was never for an instant lost sight of by her.",
        "Hence it was that Chia Cheng having, a few days back, heard his teacher\nextol him for his extreme abilities, he forthwith put him to the test on\nthe occasion of their ramble through the garden. And though (his\ncompositions) were not in the bold style of a writer of note, yet they\nwere productions of their own family, and would, moreover, be\ninstrumental, when the Chia consort had her notice attracted by them,\nand come to know that they were devised by her beloved brother, in also\nnot rendering nugatory the anxious interest which she had ever\nentertained on his behalf, and he, therefore, purposely adopted what had\nbeen suggested by Pao-yü; while for those places, for which on that day\nno devices had been completed, a good number were again subsequently\ncomposed to make up what was wanted.",
        "After the Chia consort had, for we shall now return to her, perused the\nfour characters, she gave a smile. “The two words ’flower-laden bank,’\"\nshe said, “are really felicitous, so what use was there for ’persicary\nbeach?’”",
        "When the eunuch in waiting heard this observation, he promptly jumped\noff the craft on to the bank, and at a flying pace hurried to\ncommunicate it to Chia Cheng, and Chia Cheng instantly effected the\nnecessary alteration.",
        "By this time the craft had reached the inner bank, and leaving the boat,\nand mounting into her sedan chair, she in due course contemplated the\nmagnificent Jade-like Palace; the Hall of cinnamon wood, lofty and\nsublime; and the marble portals with the four characters in bold style:\nthe “Precious confines of heavenly spirits,” which the Chia consort gave\ndirections should be changed for the four words denoting: “additional\nHall (for the imperial consort) on a visit to her parents.” And\nforthwith making her entrance into the travelling lodge her gaze was\nattracted by torches burning in the court encompassing the heavens,\nfragments of incense strewn on the ground, fire-like trees and gem-like\nflowers, gold-like windows and jade-like bannisters. But it would be\ndifficult to give a full account of the curtains, which rolled up (as\nfine as a) shrimp’s moustache; of the carpets of other skins spread on\nthe floor; of the tripods exhaling the fragrant aroma of the brain of\nthe musk deer; of the screens in a row resembling fans made of pheasant\ntails. Indeed, the gold-like doors and the windows like jade were\nsuggestive of the abode of spirits; while the halls made of cinnamon\nwood and the palace of magnolia timber, of the very homes of the\nimperial secondary consorts.",
        "“Why is it,” the Chia consort inquired, “that there is no tablet in this\nHall?”",
        "The eunuch in waiting fell on his knees. “This is the main Hall,” he\nreverently replied, “and the officials, outside the palace, did not\npresume to take upon themselves to suggest any motto.”",
        "The Chia consort shook her head and said not a word; whereupon the\neunuch, who acted as master of ceremonies, requested Her Majesty to\nascend the throne and receive homage. The band stationed on the two\nflights of steps struck up a tune, while two eunuchs ushered Chia She,\nChia Cheng and the other members on to the moonlike stage, where they\narranged themselves in order and ascended into the hall, but when the\nladies-in-waiting transmitted her commands that the homage could be\ndispensed with, they at once retraced their footsteps.",
        "(The master of the ceremonies), in like manner led forward the dowager\nlady of the Jung Kuo mansion, as well as the female relatives, from the\nsteps on the east side, on to the moon-like stage; where they were\nplaced according to their ranks. But the maids-of-honour again commanded\nthat they should dispense with the ceremony, so they likewise promptly\nwithdrew.",
        "After tea had been thrice presented, the Chia consort descended the\nThrone, and the music ceased. She retired into a side room to change her\ncostume, and the private chairs were then got ready for her visit to her\nparents. Issuing from the garden, she came into the main quarters\nbelonging to dowager lady Chia, where she was bent upon observing the\ndomestic conventionalities, when her venerable ladyship, and the other\nmembers of the family, prostrated themselves in a body before her, and\nmade her desist. Tears dropped down from the eyes of the Chia consort as\n(she and her relatives) mutually came forward, and greeted each other,\nand as with one hand she grasped old lady Chia, and with the other she\nheld madame Wang, the three had plenty in their hearts which they were\nfain to speak about; but, unable as each one of them was to give\nutterance to their feelings, all they did was to sob and to weep, as\nthey kept face to face to each other; while madame Hsing, widow Li Wan,\nWang Hsi-feng, and the three sisters: Ying Ch’un, T’an Ch’un, and Hsi\nCh’un, stood aside in a body shedding tears and saying not a word.",
        "After a long time, the Chia consort restrained her anguish, and forcing\na smile, she set to work to reassure old lady Chia and madame Wang.\n\"Having in days gone by,” she urged, “been sent to that place where no\nhuman being can be seen, I have to-day after extreme difficulty returned\nhome; and now that you ladies and I have been reunited, instead of\nchatting or laughing we contrariwise give way to incessant tears! But\nshortly, I shall be gone, and who knows when we shall be able again to\neven see each other!”",
        "When she came to this sentence, they could not help bursting into\nanother tit of crying; and Madame Hsing hastened to come forward, and to\nconsole dowager lady Chia and the rest. But when the Chia consort\nresumed her seat, and one by one came again, in turn, to exchange\nsalutations, they could not once more help weeping and sobbing for a\ntime.",
        "Next in order, were the managers and servants of the eastern and western\nmansions to perform their obeisance in the outer pavilion; and after the\nmarried women and waiting-maids had concluded their homage, the Chia\nconsort heaved a sigh. “How many relatives,” she observed, “there are\nall of whom, alas! I may not see.”",
        "“There are here now,” madame Wang rejoined with due respect, “kindred\nwith outside family names, such as Mrs. Hsüeh, née Wang, Pao-ch’ai, and\nTai-yü waiting for your commands; but as they are distant relatives, and\nwithout official status, they do not venture to arrogate to themselves\nthe right of entering into your presence.” But the Chia consort issued\ndirections that they should be invited to come that they should see each\nother; and in a short while, Mrs. Hsüeh and the other relatives walked\nin, but as they were on the point of performing the rites, prescribed by\nthe state, she bade them relinquish the observance so that they came\nforward, and each, in turn, alluded to what had transpired during the\nlong separation.",
        "Pao Ch’in also and a few other waiting-maids, whom the Chia consort had\noriginally taken along with her into the palace, knocked their heads\nbefore dowager lady Chia, but her ladyship lost no time in raising them\nup, and in bidding them go into a separate suite of rooms to be\nentertained; and as for the retainers, eunuchs as well as\nmaids-of-honour, ladies-in-waiting and every attendant, there were\nneedless to say, those in the two places, the Ning mansion and Chia\nShe’s residence, to wait upon them; there only remained three or four\nyoung eunuchs to answer the summons.",
        "The mother and daughter and her cousins conversed for some time on what\nhad happened during the protracted separation, as well as on domestic\naffairs and their private feelings, when Chia Cheng likewise advanced as\nfar as the other side of the portiere, and inquired after her health,\nand the Chia consort from inside performed the homage and other\nconventionalities (due to her parent).",
        "“The families of farmers,” she further went on to say to her father,\n\"feed on salted cabbage, and clothe in cotton material; but they readily\nenjoy the happiness of the relationships established by heaven! We,\nhowever, relatives though we now be of one bone and flesh, are, with all\nour affluence and honours, living apart from each other, and deriving no\nhappiness whatsoever!”",
        "Chia Cheng, on his part endeavoured, to restrain his tears. “I\nbelonged,” he rejoined, “to a rustic and poor family; and among that\nwhole number of pigeons and pheasants, how could I have imagined that I\nwould have obtained the blessing of a hidden phoenix! Of late all for\nthe sake of your honourable self, His Majesty, above, confers upon us\nhis heavenly benefits; while we, below, show forth the virtue of our\nancestors! And it is mainly because the vital principle of the hills,\nstreams, sun, and moon, and the remote virtue of our ancestors have been\nimplanted in you alone that this good fortune has attained me Cheng and\nmy wife! Moreover, the present emperor, bearing in mind the great bounty\nshewn by heaven and earth in promoting a ceaseless succession, has\nvouchsafed a more generous act of grace than has ever been displayed\nfrom old days to the present. And although we may besmear our liver and\nbrain in the mire, how could we show our gratitude, even to so slight a\ndegree as one ten-thousandth part. But all I can do is, in the daytime,\nto practise diligence, vigilance at night, and loyalty in my official\nduties. My humble wish is that His Majesty, my master, may live ten\nthousand years and see thousands of autumns, so as to promote the\nwelfare of all mankind in the world! And you, worthy imperial consort,\nmust, on no account, be mindful of me Cheng and my wife, decrepid as we\nare in years. What I would solicit more than anything is that you should\nbe more careful of yourself, and that you should be diligent and\nreverential in your service to His Majesty, with the intent that you may\nnot prove ungrateful of his affectionate regard and bountiful grace.”",
        "The Chia consort, on the other hand, enjoined “that much as it was\nexpedient to display zeal, in the management of state matters, it\nbehoved him, when he had any leisure, to take good care of himself, and\nthat he should not, whatever he did, give way to solicitude on her\nbehalf.” And Chia Cheng then went on to say “that the various\ninscriptions in the park over the pavilions, terraces, halls and\nresidences had been all composed by Pao-yü, and, that in the event of\nthere being one or two that could claim her attention, he would be happy\nif it would please her to at once favour him with its name.” Whereupon\nthe imperial consort Yüan, when she heard that Pao-yü could compose\nverses, forthwith exclaimed with a smile: “He has in very truth made\nprogress!”",
        "After Chia Cheng had retired out of the hall, the Chia consort made it a\npoint to ask: “How is it that I do not see Pao-yü?” and dowager lady\nChia explained: “An outside male relative as he is, and without official\nrank, he does not venture to appear before you of his own accord.”",
        "“Bring him in!” the imperial consort directed; whereupon a young eunuch\nushered Pao-yü in. After he had first complied with the state\nceremonies, she bade him draw near to her, and taking his hand, she held\nit in her lap, and, as she went on to caress his head and neck, she\nsmiled and said: “He’s grown considerably taller than he was before;\"\nbut she had barely concluded this remark, when her tears ran down as\nprofuse as rain. Mrs. Yu, lady Feng, and the rest pressed forward. “The\nbanquet is quite ready,” they announced, “and your highness is requested\nto favour the place with your presence.”",
        "The imperial consort Yuan stood up and asking Pao-yü to lead the way,\nshe followed in his steps, along with the whole party, and betook\nherself on foot as far as the entrance of the garden gate, whence she at\nonce espied, in the lustre shed by the lanterns, every kind of\ndecorations. Entering the garden, they first passed the spots with the\ndevice “a phoenix comes with dignified air,” “the red (flowers are)\nfragrant and the green (banana leaves like) jade!” “the sign on the\napricot tree is visible,” “the fragrance pure of the ligularia and\niris,” and other places; and ascending the towers they walked up the\nhalls, forded the streams and wound round the hills; contemplating as\nthey turned their gaze from side to side, each place arranged in a\ndifferent style, and each kind of article laid out in unique designs.\nThe Chia consort expressed her admiration in most profuse eulogiums, and\nthen went on to advise them: “that it was not expedient to indulge in\nfuture in such excessive extravagance and that all these arrangements\nwere over and above what should have been done.”",
        "Presently they reached the main pavilion, where she commanded that they\ncould dispense with the rites and take their seats. A sumptuous banquet\nwas laid out, at which dowager lady Chia and the other ladies occupied\nthe lower seats and entertained each other, while Mrs. Yu, widow Li Wan,\nlady Feng and the rest presented the soup and handed the cups. The\nImperial consort Yuan subsequently directed that the pencils and\ninkslabs should be brought, and with her own hands she opened the silken\npaper. She chose the places she liked, and conferred upon them a name;\nand devising a general designation for the garden, she called it the Ta\nKuan garden (Broad vista), while for the tablet of the main pavilion the\ndevice she composed ran as follows: “Be mindful of the grace and\nremember the equity (of His Majesty);” with this inscription on the\nantithetical scrolls:",
        "  Mercy excessive Heaven and earth display,\n  And it men young and old hail gratefully;\n  From old till now they pour their bounties great\n  Those rich gifts which Cathay and all states permeate.",
        "Changing also the text: “A phoenix comes with dignified air for the\nHsiao Hsiang Lodge.”",
        "“The red (flowers are) fragrant and the green (banana leaves like)\njade,” she altered into “Happy red and joyful green\"; bestowing upon the\nplace the appellation of the I Hung court (joyful red). The spot where\n\"the fragrance pure of the ligularia and iris,” was inscribed, she\ncalled “the ligularia and the ’Wu’ weed court;” and where was “the sign\nin the apricot tree is visible,” she designated “the cottage in the\nhills where dolichos is bleached.” The main tower she called the Broad\nVista Tower. The lofty tower facing the east, she designated “the\nvariegated and flowery Hall;” bestowing on the line of buildings, facing\nthe west, the appellation of “the Hall of Occult Fragrance;” and besides\nthese figured such further names as: “the Hall of peppery wind,” “the\nArbour of lotus fragrance,” “the Islet of purple caltrop,” “the Bank of\ngolden lotus,” and the like. There were also tablets with four\ncharacters such as: “the peach blossom and the vernal rain;” “the\nautumnal wind prunes the Eloecocca,” “the artemisia leaves and the night\nsnow,” and other similar names which could not all be placed on record.\nShe furthermore directed that such tablets as were already put up,\nshould not be dismounted, and she forthwith took the lead and composed\nan heptameter stanza, the burden of which was:",
        "  Hills it enclasps, embraces streams, with skill it is laid out:\n  What task the grounds to raise! the works to start and bring about!\n  Of scenery in heaven and amongst men store has been made;\n  The name Broad Vista o’er the fragrant park should be engraved.",
        "When she had finished writing, she observed smilingly, as she addressed\nherself to all the young ladies: “I have all along lacked the quality of\nsharpness and never besides been good at verses; as you, sisters, and\nall of you have ever been aware; but, on a night like this I’ve been\nfain to do my best, with the object of escaping censure, and of not\nreflecting injustice on this scenery and nothing more. But some other\nday when I’ve got time, be it ever so little, I shall deem it my duty to\nmake up what remains by inditing a record of the Broad Vista Garden, as\nwell as a song on my visit to my parents and other such literary\nproductions in memory of the events of this day. You sisters and others\nmust, each of you, in like manner compose a stanza on the motto on each\ntablet, expressing your sentiments, as you please, without being\nrestrained by any regard for my meagre ability. Knowing as I do besides\nthat Pao-yü is, indeed, able to write verses, I feel the more delighted!\nBut among his compositions, those I like the best are those in the two\nplaces, ’the Hsiao Hsiang Lodge,’ and ’the court of Heng and Wu;’ and\nnext those of ’the Joyful red court,’ and ’the cottage in the hills,\nwhere the dolichos is bleached.’ As for grand sites like these four,\nthere should be found some out-of-the-way expressions to insert in the\nverses so that they should be felicitous. The antithetical lines\ncomposed by you, (Pao-yü), on a former occasion are excellent, it is\ntrue; but you should now further indite for each place, a pentameter\nstanza, so that by allowing me to test you in my presence, you may not\nshow yourself ungrateful for the trouble I have taken in teaching you\nfrom your youth up.”",
        "Pao-yü had no help but to assent, and descending from the hall, he went\noff all alone to give himself up to reflection.",
        "Of the three Ying Ch’un, T’an Ch’un, and Hsi Ch’un, T’an Ch’un must be\nconsidered to have also been above the standard of her sisters, but she,\nin her own estimation, imagined it, in fact, difficult to compete with\nHsüeh Pao-ch’ai and Lin Tai-yü. With no alternative however than that of\ndoing her best, she followed the example of all the rest with the sole\npurpose of warding off criticism. And Li Wan too succeeded, after much\nexertion, in putting together a stanza.",
        "The consort of the Chia family perused in due order the verses written\nby the young ladies, the text of which is given below.",
        "The lines written by Ying Ch’un on the tablet of “Boundless spirits and\nblissful heart” were:",
        "  A park laid out with scenery surpassing fine and rare!\n  Submissive to thy will, on boundless bliss bashful I write!\n  Who could believe that yonder scenes in this world found a share!\n  Will not thy heart be charmed on thy visit by the sight?",
        "These are the verses by T’an Ch’un on the tablet of “All nature vies in\nsplendour”:",
        "  Of aspect lofty and sublime is raised a park of fame!\n  Honoured with thy bequest, my shallow lore fills me with shame.\n  No words could e’er amply exhaust the beauteous skill,\n  For lo! in very truth glory and splendour all things fill!",
        "Thus runs Hsi Ch’un’s stanza on the tablet of the “Conception of\nliterary compositions”:",
        "  The hillocks and the streams crosswise beyond a thousand li extend!\n  The towers and terraces ’midst the five-coloured clouds lofty ascend!\n  In the resplendent radiance of both sun and moon the park it lies!\n  The skill these scenes to raise the skill e’en essays to conceive\n      outvies!",
        "The lines composed by Li Wan on the tablet “grace and elegance,\"\nconsisted of:",
        "  The comely streams and hillocks clear, in double folds, embrace;\n  E’en Fairyland, forsooth, transcend they do in elegance and grace!\n  The “Fragrant Plant” the theme is of the ballad fan, green-made.\n  Like drooping plum-bloom flap the lapel red and the Hsiang gown.\n  From prosperous times must have been handed down those pearls and\n      jade.\n  What bliss! the fairy on the jasper terrace will come down!\n  When to our prayers she yields, this glorious park to contemplate,\n  No mortal must e’er be allowed these grounds to penetrate.",
        "The ode by Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai on the tablet of “Concentrated Splendour and\nAccumulated auspiciousness” was:",
        "  Raised on the west of the Imperial city, lo! the park stored with\n      fragrant smell,\n  Shrouded by Phoebe’s radiant rays and clouds of good omen, in wondrous\n      glory lies!\n  The willows tall with joy exult that the parrots their nests have\n      shifted from the dell.\n  The bamboo groves, when laid, for the phoenix with dignity to come,\n      were meant to rise.\n  The very eve before the Empress’ stroll, elegant texts were ready and\n      affixed.\n  If even she her parents comes to see, how filial piety supreme must\n      be!\n  When I behold her beauteous charms and talents supernatural, with awe\n      transfixed,\n  One word, to utter more how can I troth ever presume, when shame\n      overpowers me.",
        "The distich by Lin Tai-yü on the tablet of “Spiritual stream outside the\nworld,” ran thus:",
        "  Th’ imperial visit doth enhance joy and delight.\n  This fairy land from mortal scenes what diff’rent sight!\n  The comely grace it borrows of both hill and stream;\n  And to the landscape it doth add a charm supreme.\n  The fumes of Chin Ku wine everything permeate;\n  The flowers the inmate of the Jade Hall fascinate.\n  The imperial favour to receive how blessed our lot!\n  For oft the palace carriage will pass through this spot.",
        "The Chia consort having concluded the perusal of the verses, and\nextolled them for a time: “After all,” she went on to say with a smile,\n\"those composed by my two cousins, Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai and Lin Tai-yü,\ndiffer in excellence from those of all the rest; and neither I, stupid\nas I am, nor my sisters can attain their standard.”",
        "Lin Tao-yü had, in point of fact, made up her mind to display, on this\nevening, her extraordinary abilities to their best advantage, and to put\ndown every one else, but contrary to her expectations the Chia consort\nhad expressed her desire that no more than a single stanza should be\nwritten on each tablet, so that unable, after all, to disregard her\ndirections by writing anything in excess, she had no help but to compose\na pentameter stanza, in an offhand way, merely with the intent of\ncomplying with her wishes.",
        "Pao-yü had by this time not completed his task. He had just finished two\nstanzas on the Hsiao Hsiang Lodge and the Heng Wu garden, and was just\nthen engaged in composing a verse on the “Happy red Court.” In his draft\nfigured a line: “The (leaves) of jade-like green in spring are yet\nrolled up,” which Pao-ch’ai stealthily observed as she turned her eyes\nfrom side to side; and availing herself of the very first moment, when\nnone of the company could notice her, she gave him a nudge. “As her\nhighness,” she remarked, “doesn’t relish the four characters,\nrepresenting the red (flowers are) fragrant, and the green (banana\nleaves) like jade, she changed them, just a while back, for ’the joyful\nred and gladsome green;’ and if you deliberately now again employ these\ntwo words ’jade-like green,’ won’t it look as if you were bent upon\nbeing at variance with her? Besides, very many are the old books, in\nwhich the banana leaves form the theme, so you had better think of\nanother line and substitute it and have done with it!”",
        "When Pao-yü heard the suggestion made by Pao-ch’ai, he speedily replied,\nas he wiped off the perspiration: “I can’t at all just at present call\nto mind any passage from the contents of some old book.”",
        "“Just simply take,” proposed Pao-ch’ai smilingly, “the character jade in\njade-like green and change it into the character wax, that’s all.”",
        "“Does ’green wax,’” Pao-yü inquired, “come out from anywhere?”",
        "Pao-ch’ai gently smacked her lips and nodded her head as she laughed. “I\nfear,” she said, “that if, on an occasion like to-night, you show no\nmore brains than this, by and by when you have to give any answers in\nthe golden hall, to the questions (of the examiner), you will, really,\nforget (the very first four names) of Chao, Oh’ien, Sun and Li (out of\nthe hundred)! What, have you so much as forgotten the first line of the\npoem by Han Yü, of the T’ang dynasty, on the Banana leaf:",
        " “Cold is the candle and without a flame, the green wax dry?”",
        "On hearing these words, Pao-yü’s mind suddenly became enlightened. “What\na fool I am!” he added with a simper; “I couldn’t for the moment even\nremember the lines, ready-made though they were and staring at me in my\nvery eyes! Sister, you really can be styled my teacher, little though\nyou may have taught me, and I’ll henceforward address you by no other\nname than ’teacher,’ and not call you ’sister’ any more!”",
        "“Don’t you yet hurry to go on,” Pao-ch’ai again observed in a gentle\ntone of voice sneeringly, “but keep on calling me elder sister and\nyounger sister? Who’s your sister? that one over there in a yellow coat\nis your sister!”",
        "But apprehending, as she bandied these jokes, lest she might be wasting\nhis time, she felt constrained to promptly move away; whereupon Pao-yü\ncontinued the ode he had been working at, and brought it to a close,\nwriting in all three stanzas.",
        "Tai-yü had not had so far an opportunity of making a display of her\nability, and was feeling at heart in a very dejected mood; but when she\nperceived that Pao-yü was having intense trouble in conceiving what he\nhad to write, and she found, upon walking up to the side of the table,\nthat he had only one stanza short, that on “the sign on the apricot tree\nis visible,” she consequently bade him copy out clean the first three\nodes, while she herself composed a stanza, which she noted down on a\nslip of paper, rumpled up into a ball, and threw just in front of\nPao-yü.",
        "As soon as Pao-yü opened it and glanced at it, he realised that it was a\nhundred times better than his own three stanzas, and transcribing it\nwithout loss of time, in a bold writing, he handed up his compositions.",
        "On perusal, the Chia Consort read what follows. By Pao-yü, on: “A\nphoenix comes with dignified air:”",
        "  The bamboos just now don that jadelike grace,\n  Which worthy makes them the pheasant to face;\n  Each culm so tender as if to droop fain,\n  Each one so verdant, in aspect so cool,\n  The curb protects, from the steps wards the pool.\n  The pervious screens the tripod smell restrain.\n  The shadow will be strewn, mind do not shake\n  And (Hsieh) from her now long fine dream (awake)!",
        "On “the pure fragrance of the Ligularia and Iris Florentina:”",
        "  Hengs and Wus the still park permeate;\n  The los and pis their sweet perfume enhance;\n  And supple charms the third spring flowers ornate;\n  Softly is wafted one streak of fragrance!\n  A light mist doth becloud the tortuous way!\n  With moist the clothes bedews, that verdure cold!\n  The pond who ever sinuous could hold?\n  Dreams long and subtle, dream the household Hsieh.",
        "On “the happy red and joyful green:”",
        "  Stillness pervades the deep pavilion on a lengthy day.\n  The green and red, together matched, transcendent grace display.\n  Unfurled do still remain in spring the green and waxlike leaves.\n  No sleep yet seeks the red-clad maid, though night’s hours be\n      far-spent,\n  But o’er the rails lo, she reclines, dangling her ruddy sleeves;\n  Against the stone she leans shrouded by taintless scent,\n  And stands the quarter facing whence doth blow the eastern wind!\n  Her lord and master must look up to her with feelings kind.",
        "On “the sign on the apricot tree is visible:”",
        "  The apricot tree sign to drink wayfarers doth invite;\n  A farm located on a hill, lo! yonder strikes the sight!\n  And water caltrops, golden lotus, geese, as well as flows,\n  And mulberry and elm trees which afford rest to swallows.\n  That wide extent of spring leeks with verdure covers the ground;\n  And o’er ten li the paddy blossom fragrance doth abound.\n  In days of plenty there’s a lack of dearth and of distress,\n  And what need then is there to plough and weave with such briskness?",
        "When the Chia consort had done with the perusal, excessive joy filled\nher heart. “He has indeed made progress!” she exclaimed, and went on to\npoint at the verses on “the sign on the apricot tree,” as being the\ncrowning piece of the four stanzas. In due course, she with her own\nhands changed the motto “a cottage in the hills where dolichos is\nbleached” into “the paddy-scented village;” and bidding also T’an Ch’un\nto take the several tens of stanzas written then, and to transcribe them\nseparately on ornamented silk paper, she commanded a eunuch to send them\nto the outer quarters. And when Chia Cheng and the other men perused\nthem, one and all sung their incessant praise, while Chia Cheng, on his\npart, sent in some complimentary message, with regard to her return home\non a visit.",
        "Yuan Ch’un went further and gave orders that luscious wines, a ham and\nother such presents should be conferred upon Pao-yü, as well as upon\nChia Lan. This Chia Lan was as yet at this time a perfect youth without\nany knowledge of things in general, so that all that he could do was to\nfollow the example of his mother, and imitate his uncle in performing\nthe conventional rites.",
        "At the very moment that Chia Se felt unable, along with a company of\nactresses, to bear the ordeal of waiting on the ground floor of the\ntwo-storied building, he caught sight of a eunuch come running at a\nflying pace. “The composition of verses is over,” he said, “so quick\ngive me the programme;” whereupon Chia Se hastened to present the\nprogramme as well as a roll of the names of the twelve girls. And not a\nlong interval elapsed before four plays were chosen; No. 1 being the\nImperial Banquet; No. 2 Begging (the weaver goddess) for skill in\nneedlework; No. 3 The spiritual match; and No. 4 the Parting spirit.\nChia Se speedily lent a hand in the getting up, and the preparations for\nthe performance, and each of the girls sang with a voice sufficient to\nsplit the stones and danced in the manner of heavenly spirits; and\nthough their exterior was that of the characters in which they were\ndressed up for the play, their acting nevertheless represented, in a\nperfect manner, both sorrow as well as joy. As soon as the performance\nwas brought to a close, a eunuch walked in holding a golden salver\ncontaining cakes, sweets, and the like, and inquired who was Ling Kuan;\nand Chia Se readily concluding that these articles were presents\nbestowed upon Ling Kuan, made haste to take them over, as he bade Ling\nKuan prostrate herself.",
        "“The honourable consort,” the eunuch further added, “directs that Ling\nKuan, who is the best actress of the lot, should sing two more songs;\nany two will do, she does not mind what they are.”",
        "Chia Se at once expressed his obedience, and felt constrained to urge\nLing Kuan to sing the two ballads entitled: “The walk through the\ngarden” and “Frightened out of a dream.” But Ling Kuan asserted that\nthese two ballads had not originally been intended for her own role; and\nbeing firm in her refusal to accede and insisting upon rendering the two\nsongs “The Mutual Promise” and “The Mutual Abuse,” Chia Se found it hard\nto bring her round, and had no help but to let her have her own way. The\nChia consort was so extremely enchanted with her that she gave\ndirections that she should not be treated harshly, and that this girl\nshould receive a careful training, while besides the fixed number of\npresents, she gave her two rolls of palace silk, two purses, gold and\nsilver ingots, and presents in the way of eatables.",
        "Subsequently, when the banquet had been cleared, and she once more\nprosecuted her visit through those places to which she had not been, she\nquite accidentally espied the Buddhist Temple encircled by hills, and\npromptly rinsing her hands, she walked in and burnt incense and\nworshipped Buddha. She also composed the device for a tablet, “a humane\nboat on the (world’s) bitter sea,” and went likewise so far as to show\nspecial acts of additional grace to a company of ascetic nuns and Taoist\npriestesses.",
        "A eunuch came in a short while and reverently fell on his knees. “The\npresents are all in readiness,” he reported, “and may it please you to\ninspect them and to distribute them, in compliance with custom;” and\npresented to her a list, which the Chia consort perused from the very\ntop throughout without raising any objection, and readily commanding\nthat action should be taken according to the list, a eunuch descended\nand issued the gifts one after another. The presents for dowager lady\nChia consisted, it may be added, of two sceptres, one of gold, the other\nof jade, with “may your wishes be fulfilled” inscribed on them; a staff\nmade of lign-aloes; a string of chaplet beads of Chia-nan fragrant wood;\nfour rolls of imperial satins with words “Affluence and honours” and\nPerennial Spring (woven in them); four rolls of imperial silk with\nPerennial Happiness and Longevity; two shoes of purple gold bullion,\nrepresenting a pen, an ingot and “as you like;” and ten silver ingots\nwith the device “Felicitous Blessings.” While the two shares for madame\nHsing and madame Wang were only short of hers by the sceptres and\nstaffs, four things in all. Chia She, Chia Cheng and the others had each\napportioned to him a work newly written by the Emperor, two boxes of\nsuperior ink, and gold and silver cups, two pairs of each; their other\ngifts being identical with those above. Pao-ch’ai, Tai-yü, all the\nsisters and the rest were assigned each a copy of a new book, a fine\nslab and two pair of gold and silver ornaments of a novel kind and\noriginal shape; Pao-yü likewise receiving the same presents. Chia Lan’s\ngifts consisted of two necklets, one of gold, the other of silver, and\nof two pair of gold ingots. Mrs. Yu, widow Li Wan, lady Feng and the\nothers had each of them, four ingots of gold and silver; and, in the way\nof keepsakes, four pieces of silk. There were, in addition, presents\nconsisting of twenty-four pieces of silk and a thousand strings of good\ncash to be allotted to the nurses, and waiting-maids, in the apartments\nof dowager lady Chia, madame Wang and of the respective sisters; while\nChia Chen, Chia Lien, Chia Huan, Chia Jung and the rest had, every one,\nfor presents, a piece of silk, and a pair of gold and silver ingots.",
        "As regards the other gifts, there were a hundred rolls of various\ncoloured silks, a thousand ounces of pure silver, and several bottles of\nimperial wine, intended to be bestowed upon all the men-servants of the\nmansions, on the East and the West, as well as upon those who had been\nin the garden overseeing works, arranging the decorations, and in\nwaiting to answer calls, and upon those who looked after the theatres\nand managed the lanterns. There being, besides, five hundred strings of\npure cash for the cooks, waiters, jugglers and hundreds of actors and\nevery kind of domestic.",
        "The whole party had finished giving expression to their thanks for her\nbounty, when the managers and eunuchs respectfully announced: “It is\nalready a quarter to three, and may it please your Majesty to turn back\nyour imperial chariot;” whereupon, much against her will, the Chia\nconsort’s eyes brimmed over, and she once more gave vent to tears.\nForcing herself however again to put on a smile, she clasped old lady\nChia’s and madame Wang’s hands, and could not bring herself to let them\ngo; while she repeatedly impressed upon their minds: that there was no\nneed to give way to any solicitude, and that they should take good care\nof their healths; that the grace of the present emperor was so vast,\nthat once a month he would grant permission for them to enter the palace\nand pay her a visit. “It is easy enough for us to see each other,” (she\nsaid,) “and why should we indulge in any excess of grief? But when his\nmajesty in his heavenly generosity allows me another time to return\nhome, you shouldn’t go in for such pomp and extravagance.”",
        "Dowager lady Chia and the other inmates had already cried to such an\nextent that sobs choked their throats and they could with difficulty\ngive utterance to speech. But though the Chia consort could not\nreconcile herself to the separation, the usages in vogue in the imperial\nhousehold could not be disregarded or infringed, so that she had no\nalternative but to stifle the anguish of her heart, to mount her\nchariot, and take her departure.",
        "The whole family experienced meanwhile a hard task before they succeeded\nin consoling the old lady and madame Wang and in supporting them away\nout of the garden. But as what follows is not ascertained, the next\nchapter will disclose it.",
        "  In the vehemence of her feelings, Hua (Hsi Jen) on a quiet evening\n      admonishes Pao-yü.\n  While (the spell) of affection continues unbroken, Pao-yü, on a still\n      day, perceives the fragrance emitted from Tai-yü’s person.",
        "The Chia consort, we must now go on to explain, returned to the Palace,\nand the next day, on her appearance in the presence of His Majesty, she\nthanked him for his bounty and gave him furthermore an account of her\nexperiences on her visit home. His Majesty’s dragon countenance was much\nelated, and he also issued from the privy store coloured satins, gold\nand silver and such like articles to be presented to Chia Cheng and the\nother officials in the various households of her relatives. But\ndispensing with minute details about them, we will now revert to the two\nmansions of Jung and Ning.",
        "With the extreme strain on mind and body for successive days, the\nstrength of one and all was, in point of fact, worn out and their\nrespective energies exhausted. And it was besides after they had been\nputting by the various decorations and articles of use for two or three\ndays, that they, at length, got through the work.",
        "Lady Feng was the one who had most to do, and whose responsibilities\nwere greatest. The others could possibly steal a few leisure moments and\nretire to rest, while she was the sole person who could not slip away.\nIn the second place, naturally anxious as she was to excel and both to\nfall in people’s estimation, she put up with the strain just as if she\nwere like one of those who had nothing to attend to. But the one who had\nthe least to do and had the most leisure was Pao-yü.",
        "As luck would have it on this day, at an early hour, Hsi Jen’s mother\ncame again in person and told dowager lady Chia that she would take Hsi\nJen home to drink a cup of tea brewed in the new year and that she would\nreturn in the evening. For this reason Pao-yü was only in the company of\nall the waiting-maids, throwing dice, playing at chess and amusing\nhimself. But while he was in the room playing with them with a total\nabsence of zest, he unawares perceived a few waiting-maids arrive, who\ninformed him that their senior master Mr. Chen, of the Eastern Mansion,\nhad come to invite him to go and see a theatrical performance, and the\nfireworks, which were to be let off.",
        "Upon hearing these words, Pao-yü speedily asked them to change his\nclothes; but just as he was ready to start, presents of cream, steamed\nwith sugar, arrived again when least expected from the Chia Consort, and\nPao-yü recollecting with what relish Hsi Jen had partaken of this dish\non the last occasion forthwith bid them keep it for her; while he went\nhimself and told dowager lady Chia that he was going over to see the\nplay.",
        "The plays sung over at Chia Chen’s consisted, who would have thought it,\nof “Ting L’ang recognises his father,” and “Huang Po-ying deploys the\nspirits for battle,” and in addition to these, “Sung Hsing-che causes\ngreat commotion in the heavenly palace;” “Ghiang T’ai-kung kills the\ngeneral and deifies him,” and other such like. Soon appeared the spirits\nand devils in a confused crowd on the stage, and suddenly also became\nvisible the whole band of sprites and goblins, among which were some\nwaving streamers, as they went past in a procession, invoking Buddha and\nburning incense. The sound of the gongs and drums and of shouts and\ncries were audible at a distance beyond the lane; and in the whole\nstreet, one and all extolled the performance as exceptionally grand, and\nthat the like could never have been had in the house of any other\nfamily.",
        "Pao-yü, noticing that the commotion and bustle had reached a stage so\nunbearable to his taste, speedily betook himself, after merely sitting\nfor a little while, to other places in search of relaxation and fun.\nFirst of all, he entered the inner rooms, and after spending some time\nin chatting and laughing with Mrs. Yu, the waiting-maids, and secondary\nwives, he eventually took his departure out of the second gate; and as\nMrs. Yu and her companions were still under the impression that he was\ngoing out again to see the play, they let him speed on his way, without\nso much as keeping an eye over him.",
        "Chia Chen, Chia Lien, Hsúeh P’an and the others were bent upon guessing\nenigmas, enforcing the penalties and enjoying themselves in a hundred\nand one ways, so that even allowing that they had for a moment noticed\nthat he was not occupying his seat, they must merely have imagined that\nhe had gone inside and not, in fact, worried their minds about him. And\nas for the pages, who had come along with Pao-yü, those who were a\nlittle advanced in years, knowing very well that Pao-yü would, on an\noccasion like the present, be sure not to be going before dusk,\nstealthily therefore took advantage of his absence, those, who could, to\ngamble for money, and others to go to the houses of relatives and\nfriends to drink of the new year tea, so that what with gambling and\ndrinking the whole bevy surreptitiously dispersed, waiting for dusk\nbefore they came back; while those, who were younger, had all crept into\nthe green rooms to watch the excitement; with the result that Pao-yü\nperceiving not one of them about bethought himself of a small reading\nroom, which existed in previous days on this side, in which was\nsuspended a picture of a beauty so artistically executed as to look\nlife-like. “On such a bustling day as this,” he reasoned, “it’s pretty\ncertain, I fancy, that there will be no one in there; and that beautiful\nperson must surely too feel lonely, so that it’s only right that I\nshould go and console her a bit.” With these thoughts, he hastily betook\nhimself towards the side-house yonder, and as soon as he came up to the\nwindow, he heard the sound of groans in the room. Pao-yü was really\nquite startled. “What!” (he thought), “can that beautiful girl,\npossibly, have come to life!” and screwing up his courage, he licked a\nhole in the paper of the window and peeped in. It was not she, however,\nwho had come to life, but Ming Yen holding down a girl and likewise\nindulging in what the Monitory Dream Fairy had taught him.",
        "“Dreadful!” exclaimed Pao-yü, aloud, unable to repress himself, and,\nstamping one of his feet, he walked into the door to the terror of both\nof them, who parting company, shivered with fear, like clothes that are\nbeing shaken. Ming Yen perceiving that it was Pao-yü promptly fell on\nhis knees and piteously implored for pardon.",
        "“What! in broad daylight! what do you mean by it? Were your master Mr.\nChen to hear of it, would you die or live?” asked Pao-yü, as he\nsimultaneously cast a glance at the servant-girl, who although not a\nbeauty was anyhow so spick and span, and possessed besides a few charms\nsufficient to touch the heart. From shame, her face was red and her ears\npurple, while she lowered her head and uttered not a syllable.",
        "Pao-yü stamped his foot. “What!” he shouted, “don’t you yet bundle\nyourself away!”",
        "This simple remark suggested the idea to the girl’s mind who ran off, as\nif she had wings to fly with; but as Pao-yü went also so far as to go in\npursuit of her, calling out: “Don’t be afraid, I’m not one to tell\nanyone,” Ming Yen was so exasperated that he cried, as he went after\nthem, “My worthy ancestor, this is distinctly telling people about it.”",
        "“How old is that servant girl?” Pao-yü having asked; “She’s, I expect,\nno more than sixteen or seventeen,” Ming Yen rejoined.",
        "“Well, if you haven’t gone so far as to even ascertain her age,” Pao-yü\nobserved, “you’re sure to know still less about other things; and it\nmakes it plain enough that her acquaintance with you is all vain and\nfutile! What a pity! what a pity!”",
        "He then went on to enquire what her name was; and “Were I,” continued\nMing Yen smiling, “to tell you about her name it would involve a long\nyarn; it’s indeed a novel and strange story! She relates that while her\nmother was nursing her, she dreamt a dream and obtained in this dream\npossession of a piece of brocaded silk, on which were designs, in\nvariegated colours, representing opulence and honour, and a continuous\nline of the character Wan; and that this reason accounts for the name of\nWan Erh, which was given her.”",
        "“This is really strange!” Pao-yü exclaimed with a grin, after lending an\near to what he had to say; “and she is bound, I think, by and by to have\na good deal of good fortune!”",
        "These words uttered, he plunged in deep thought for a while, and Ming\nYen having felt constrained to inquire: “Why aren’t you, Mr. Secundus,\nwatching a theatrical performance of this excellent kind?” “I had been\nlooking on for ever so long,” Pao-yü replied, “until I got quite weary;\nand had just come out for a stroll, when I happened to meet you two. But\nwhat’s to be done now?”",
        "Ming Yen gave a faint smile. “As there’s no one here to know anything\nabout it,” he added, “I’ll stealthily take you, Mr. Secundus, for a walk\noutside the city walls; and we’ll come back shortly, before they’ve got\nwind of it.”",
        "“That won’t do,” Pao-yü demurred, “we must be careful, or else some\nbeggar might kidnap us away; besides, were they to come to hear of it,\nthere’ll be again a dreadful row; and isn’t it better that we should go\nto some nearer place, from which we could, after all, return at once?”",
        "“As for some nearer place,” Ming Yen observed; “to whose house can we\ngo? It’s really no easy matter!”",
        "“My idea is,” Pao-yü suggested with a smirk, “that we should simply go,\nand find sister Hua, and see what she’s up to at home.”",
        "“Yes! Yes!” Ming Yen replied laughingly; “the fact is I had forgotten\nall about her home; but should it reach their ears,” he continued,\n\"they’ll say that it was I who led you, Mr. Secundus, astray, and\nthey’ll beat me!”",
        "“I’m here for you!” Pao-yü having assured him; Ming Yen at these words\nled the horses round, and the two of them speedily made their exit by\nthe back gate. Luckily Hsi Jen’s house was not far off. It was no\nfurther than half a li’s distance, so that in a twinkle they had already\nreached the front of the door, and Ming Yen was the first to walk in and\nto call for Hsi Jen’s eldest brother Hua Tzu-fang.",
        "Hsi Jen’s mother had, on this occasion, united in her home Hsi Jen,\nseveral of her sister’s daughters, as well as a few of her nieces, and\nthey were engaged in partaking of fruits and tea, when they heard some\none outside call out, “Brother Hua.” Hua Tzu-fang lost no time in\nrushing out; and upon looking and finding that it was the two of them,\nthe master and his servant, he was so taken by surprise that his fears\ncould not be set at rest. Promptly, he clasped Pao-yü in his arms and\ndismounted him, and coming into the court, he shouted out at the top of\nhis voice: “Mr. Pao has come.” The other persons heard the announcement\nof his arrival, with equanimity, but when it reached Hsi Jen’s ears, she\ntruly felt at such a loss to fathom the object of his visit that issuing\nhastily out of the room, she came to meet Pao-yü, and as she laid hold\nof him: “Why did you come?” she asked.",
        "“I felt awfully dull,” Pao-yü rejoined with a smile, “and came to see\nwhat you were up to.”",
        "Hsi Jen at these words banished, at last, all anxiety from her mind.\n\"You’re again up to your larks,” she observed, “but what’s the aim of\nyour visit? Who else has come along with him?” she at the same time went\non to question Ming Yen.",
        "“All the others know nothing about it!” explained Ming Yen exultingly;\n\"only we two do, that’s all.”",
        "When Hsi Jen heard this remark, she gave way afresh to solicitous fears:\n\"This is dreadful!” she added; “for were you to come across any one from\nthe house, or to meet master; or were, in the streets, people to press\nagainst you, or horses to collide with you, as to make (his horse) shy,\nand he were to fall, would that too be a joke? The gall of both of you\nis larger than a peck measure; but it’s all you, Ming Yen, who has\nincited him, and when I go back, I’ll surely tell the nurses to beat\nyou.”",
        "Ming Yen pouted his mouth. “Mr. Secundus,” he pleaded, “abused me and\nbeat me, as he bade me bring him here, and now he shoves the blame on my\nshoulders! ’Don’t let us go,’ I suggested; ’but if you do insist, well\nthen let us go and have done.’”",
        "Hua Tzu-fang promptly interceded. “Let things alone,” he said; “now that\nthey’re already here, there’s no need whatever of much ado. The only\nthing is that our mean house with its thatched roof is both so crammed\nand so filthy that how could you, sir, sit in it!”",
        "Hsi Jen’s mother also came out at an early period to receive him, and\nHsi Jen pulled Pao-yü in. Once inside the room, Pao-yü perceived three\nor five girls, who, as soon as they caught sight of him approaching, all\nlowered their heads, and felt so bashful that their faces were suffused\nwith blushes. But as both Hua Tzu-fang and his mother were afraid that\nPao-yü would catch cold, they pressed him to take a seat on the\nstove-bed, and hastened to serve a fresh supply of refreshments, and to\nat once bring him a cup of good tea.",
        "“You needn’t be flurrying all for nothing,” Hsi Jen smilingly\ninterposed; “I, naturally, should know; and there’s no use of even\nlaying out any fruits, as I daren’t recklessly give him anything to\neat.”",
        "Saying this, she simultaneously took her own cushion and laid it on a\nstool, and after Pao-yü took a seat on it, she placed the footstove she\nhad been using, under his feet; and producing, from a satchet, two\npeach-blossom-scented small cakes, she opened her own hand-stove and\nthrew them into the fire; which done, she covered it well again and\nplaced it in Pao-yü’s lap. And eventually, she filled her own tea-cup\nwith tea and presented it to Pao-yü, while, during this time, her mother\nand sister had been fussing about, laying out in fine array a tableful\nof every kind of eatables.",
        "Hsi Jen noticed that there were absolutely no things that he could eat,\nbut she felt urged to say with a smile: “Since you’ve come, it isn’t\nright that you should go empty away; and you must, whether the things be\ngood or bad, taste a little, so that it may look like a visit to my\nhouse!”",
        "As she said this, she forthwith took several seeds of the fir-cone, and\ncracking off the thin skin, she placed them in a handkerchief and\npresented them to Pao-yü. But Pao-yü, espying that Hsi Jen’s two eyes\nwere slightly red, and that the powder was shiny and moist, quietly\ntherefore inquired of Hsi Jen, “Why do you cry for no rhyme or reason?”",
        "“Why should I cry?” Hsi Jen laughed; “something just got into my eyes\nand I rubbed them.” By these means she readily managed to evade\ndetection; but seeing that Pao-yü wore a deep red archery-sleeved\npelisse, ornamented with gold dragons, and lined with fur from foxes’\nribs and a grey sable fur surtout with a fringe round the border. “What!\nhave you,” she asked, “put on again your new clothes for? specially to\ncome here? and didn’t they inquire of you where you were going?”",
        "“I had changed,” Pao-yü explained with a grin, “as Mr. Chen had invited\nme to go over and look at the play.”",
        "“Well, sit a while and then go back;” Hsi Jen continued as she nodded\nher head; “for this isn’t the place for you to come to!”",
        "“You’d better be going home now,” Pao-yü suggested smirkingly; “where\nI’ve again kept something good for you.”",
        "“Gently,” smiled Hsi Jen, “for were you to let them hear, what figure\nwould we cut?” And with these, words, she put out her hand and\nunclasping from Pao-yü’s neck the jade of Spiritual Perception, she\nfaced her cousins and remarked exultingly. “Here! see for yourselves;\nlook at this and learn! When I repeatedly talked about it, you all\nthought it extraordinary, and were anxious to have a glance at it;\nto-day, you may gaze on it with all your might, for whatever precious\nthing you may by and by come to see will really never excel such an\nobject as this!”",
        "When she had finished speaking, she handed it over to them, and after\nthey had passed it round for inspection, she again fastened it properly\non Pao-yü’s neck, and also bade her brother go and hire a small\ncarriage, or engage a small chair, and escort Pao-yü back home.",
        "“If I see him back,” Hua Tzu-fang remarked, “there would be no harm,\nwere he even to ride his horse!”",
        "“It isn’t because of harm,” Hsi Jen replied; “but because he may come\nacross some one from the house.”",
        "Hua Tzu-fang promptly went and bespoke a small chair; and when it came\nto the door, the whole party could not very well detain him, and they of\ncourse had to see Pao-yü out of the house; while Hsi Jen, on the other\nhand, snatched a few fruits and gave them to Ming Yen; and as she at the\nsame time pressed in his hand several cash to buy crackers with to let\noff, she enjoined him not to tell any one as he himself would likewise\nincur blame.",
        "As she uttered these words, she straightway escorted Pao-yü as far as\noutside the door, from whence having seen him mount into the sedan\nchair, she dropped the curtain; whereupon Ming Yen and her brother, the\ntwo of them, led the horses and followed behind in his wake. Upon\nreaching the street where the Ning mansion was situated, Ming Yen told\nthe chair to halt, and said to Hua Tzu-fang, “It’s advisable that I\nshould again go, with Mr. Secundus, into the Eastern mansion, to show\nourselves before we can safely betake ourselves home; for if we don’t,\npeople will suspect!”",
        "Hua Tzu-fang, upon hearing that there was good reason in what he said,\npromptly clasped Pao-yü out of the chair and put him on the horse,\nwhereupon after Pao-yü smilingly remarked: “Excuse me for the trouble\nI’ve surely put you to,” they forthwith entered again by the back gate;\nbut putting aside all details, we will now confine ourselves to Pao-yü.",
        "After he had walked out of the door, the several waiting-maids in his\napartments played and laughed with greater zest and with less restraint.\nSome there were who played at chess, others who threw the dice or had a\ngame of cards; and they covered the whole floor with the shells of\nmelon-seeds they were cracking, when dame Li, his nurse, happened to\ncome in, propping herself on a staff, to pay her respects and to see\nPao-yü, and perceiving that Pao-yü was not at home and that the\nservant-girls were only bent upon romping, she felt intensely disgusted.\n\"Since I’ve left this place,” she therefore exclaimed with a sigh, “and\ndon’t often come here, you’ve become more and more unmannerly; while the\nother nurse does still less than ever venture to expostulate with you;\nPao-yü is like a candlestick eighty feet high, shedding light on others,\nand throwing none upon himself! All he knows is to look down upon people\nas being filthy; and yet this is his room and he allows you to put it\ntopsy-turvey, and to become more and more unmindful of decorum!”",
        "These servant-girls were well aware that Pao-yü was not particular in\nthese respects, and that in the next place nurse Li, having pleaded old\nage, resigned her place and gone home, had nowadays no control over\nthem, so that they simply gave their minds to romping and joking, and\npaid no heed whatever to her. Nurse Li however still kept on asking\nabout Pao-yü, “How much rice he now ate at one meal? and at what time he\nwent to sleep?” to which questions, the servant-girls replied quite at\nrandom; some there being too who observed: “What a dreadful despicable\nold thing she is!”",
        "“In this covered bowl,” she continued to inquire, “is cream, and why not\ngive it to me to eat?” and having concluded these words, she took it up\nand there and then began eating it.",
        "“Be quick, and leave it alone!” a servant-girl expostulated, “that, he\nsaid, was kept in order to be given to Hsi Jen; and on his return, when\nhe again gets into a huff, you, old lady, must, on your own motion,\nconfess to having eaten it, and not involve us in any way as to have to\nbear his resentment.”",
        "Nurse Li, at these words, felt both angry and ashamed. “I can’t\nbelieve,” she forthwith remarked, “that he has become so bad at heart!\nNot to speak of the milk I’ve had, I have, in fact every right to even\nsomething more expensive than this; for is it likely that he holds Hsi\nJen dearer than myself? It can’t forsooth be that he doesn’t bear in\nmind how that I’ve brought him up to be a big man, and how that he has\neaten my blood transformed into milk and grown up to this age! and will\nbe because I’m now having a bowl of milk of his be angry on that score!\nI shall, yes, eat it, and we’ll see what he’ll do! I don’t know what you\npeople think of Hsi Jen, but she was a lowbred girl, whom I’ve with my\nown hands raised up! and what fine object indeed was she!”",
        "As she spoke, she flew into a temper, and taking the cream she drank the\nwhole of it.",
        "“They don’t know how to speak properly!” another servant-girl interposed\nsarcastically, “and it’s no wonder that you, old lady, should get angry!\nPao-yü still sends you, venerable dame, presents as a proof of his\ngratitude, and is it possible that he will feel displeased for such a\nthing like this?”",
        "“You girls shouldn’t also pretend to be artful flatterers to cajole me!\"\nnurse Li added; “do you imagine that I’m not aware of the dismissal, the\nother day, of Hsi Hsüeh, on account of a cup of tea? and as it’s clear\nenough that I’ve incurred blame, I’ll come by and by and receive it!”",
        "Having said this, she went off in a dudgeon, but not a long interval\nelapsed before Pao-yü returned, and gave orders to go and fetch Hsi Jen;\nand perceiving Ching Ling reclining on the bed perfectly still: “I\npresume she’s ill,” Pao-yü felt constrained to inquire, “or if she isn’t\nill, she must have lost at cards.”",
        "“Not so!” observed Chiu Wen; “she had been a winner, but dame Li came in\nquite casually and muddled her so that she lost; and angry at this she\nrushed off to sleep.”",
        "“Don’t place yourselves,” Pao-yü smiled, “on the same footing as nurse\nLi, and if you were to let her alone, everything will be all right.”",
        "These words were still on his lips when Hsi Jen arrived. After the\nmutual salutations, Hsi Jen went on to ask of Pao-yü: “Where did you\nhave your repast? and what time did you come back?” and to present\nlikewise, on behalf of her mother and sister, her compliments to all the\ngirls, who were her companions. In a short while, she changed her\ncostume and divested herself of her fineries, and Pao-yü bade them fetch\nthe cream.",
        "“Nurse Li has eaten it,” the servant-girls rejoined, and as Pao-yü was\non the point of making some remark Hsi Jen hastened to interfere,\nlaughing the while; “Is it really this that you had kept for me? many\nthanks for the trouble; the other day, when I had some, I found it very\ntoothsome, but after I had partaken of it, I got a pain in the stomach,\nand was so much upset, that it was only after I had brought it all up\nthat I felt all right. So it’s as well that she has had it, for, had it\nbeen kept here, it would have been wasted all for no use! What I fancy\nare dry chestnuts; and while you clean a few for me, I’ll go and lay the\nbed!”",
        "Pao-yü upon hearing these words credited them as true, so that he\ndiscarded all thought of the cream and fetched the chestnuts, which he,\nwith his own hands, selected and pealed. Perceiving at the same time\nthat none of the party were present in the room, he put on a smile and\ninquired of Hsi Jen: “Who were those persons dressed in red to day?”",
        "“They’re my two cousins on my mother’s side,” Hsi Jen explained, and\nhearing this, Pao-yü sang their praise as he heaved a couple of sighs.",
        "“What are you sighing for?” Hsi Jen remarked. “I know the secret reasons\nof your heart; it’s I fancy because she isn’t fit to wear red!”",
        "“It isn’t that,” Pao-yü protested smilingly, “it isn’t that; if such a\nperson as that isn’t good enough to be dressed in red, who would\nforsooth presume to wear it? It’s because I find her so really lovely!\nand if we could, after all, manage to get her into our family, how nice\nit would be then!”",
        "Hsi Jen gave a sardonic smile. “That it’s my own fate to be a slave\r\ndoesn’t matter, but is it likely that the destiny of even my very\nrelatives could be to become one and all of them bond servants? But you\nshould certainly set your choice upon some really beautiful girl, for\nshe would in that case be good enough to enter your house.”",
        "“Here you are again with your touchiness!” Pao-yü eagerly exclaimed\nsmiling, “if I said that she should come to our house, does it\nnecessarily imply that she should be a servant? and wouldn’t it do were\nI to mention that she should come as a relative!”",
        "“That too couldn’t exalt her to be a fit match for you!” rejoined Hsi\nJen; but Pao-yü being loth to continue the conversation, simply busied\nhimself with cleaning the chestnuts.",
        "“How is it you utter not a word?” Hsi Jen laughed; “I expect it’s\nbecause I just offended you by my inconsiderate talk! But if by and by\nyou have your purpose fixed on it, just spend a few ounces of silver to\npurchase them with, and bring them in and have done!”",
        "“How would you have one make any reply?” Pao-yü smilingly rejoined; “all\nI did was to extol her charms; for she’s really fit to have been born in\na deep hall and spacious court as this; and it isn’t for such foul\nthings as myself and others to contrariwise spend our days in this\nplace!”",
        "“Though deprived of this good fortune,” Hsi Jen explained, “she’s\nnevertheless also petted and indulged and the jewel of my maternal uncle\nand my aunt! She’s now seventeen years of age, and everything in the way\nof trousseau has been got ready, and she’s to get married next year.”",
        "Upon hearing the two words “get married,” he could not repress himself\nfrom again ejaculating: “Hai hai!” but while he was in an unhappy frame\nof mind, he once more heard Hsi Jen remark as she heaved a sigh: “Ever\nsince I’ve come here, we cousins haven’t all these years been able to\nget to live together, and now that I’m about to return home, they, on\nthe other hand, will all be gone!”",
        "Pao-yü, realising that there lurked in this remark some meaning or\nother, was suddenly so taken aback that dropping the chestnuts, he\ninquired: “How is it that you now want to go back?”",
        "“I was present to-day,” Hsi Jen explained, “when mother and brother held\nconsultation together, and they bade me be patient for another year, and\nthat next year they’ll come up and redeem me out of service!”",
        "Pao-yü, at these words, felt the more distressed. “Why do they want to\nredeem you?” he consequently asked.",
        "“This is a strange question!” Hsi Jen retorted, “for I can’t really be\ntreated as if I were the issue born in this homestead of yours! All the\nmembers of my family are elsewhere, and there’s only myself in this\nplace, so that how could I end my days here?”",
        "“If I don’t let you go, it will verily be difficult for you to get\naway!” Pao-yü replied.",
        "“There has never been such a principle of action!” urged Hsi Jen; “even\nin the imperial palace itself, there’s a fixed rule, by which possibly\nevery certain number of years a selection (of those who have to go takes\nplace), and every certain number of years a new batch enters; and\nthere’s no such practice as that of keeping people for ever; not to\nspeak of your own home.”",
        "Pao-yü realised, after reflection, that she, in point of fact, was\nright, and he went on to observe: “Should the old lady not give you your\nrelease, it will be impossible for you to get off.”",
        "“Why shouldn’t she release me?” Hsi Jen questioned. “Am I really so very\nextraordinary a person as to have perchance made such an impression upon\nher venerable ladyship and my lady that they will be positive in not\nletting me go? They may, in all likelihood, give my family some more\nounces of silver to keep me here; that possibly may come about. But, in\ntruth, I’m also a person of the most ordinary run, and there are many\nmore superior to me, yea very many! Ever since my youth up, I’ve been in\nher old ladyship’s service; first by waiting upon Miss Shih for several\nyears, and recently by being in attendance upon you for another term of\nyears; and now that our people will come to redeem me, I should, as a\nmatter of right, be told to go. My idea is that even the very redemption\nmoney won’t be accepted, and that they will display such grace as to let\nme go at once. And, as for being told that I can’t be allowed to go as\nI’m so diligent in my service to you, that’s a thing that can on no\naccount come about! My faithful attendance is an obligation of my\nduties, and is no exceptional service! and when I’m gone you’ll again\nhave some other faithful attendant, and it isn’t likely that when I’m no\nmore here, you’ll find it impracticable to obtain one!”",
        "After Pao-yü had listened to these various arguments, which proved the\nreasonableness of her going and the unreasonableness of any detention,\nhe felt his heart more than ever a prey to distress. “In spite of all\nyou say,” he therefore continued, “the sole desire of my heart is to\ndetain you; and I have no doubt but that the old lady will speak to your\nmother about it; and if she were to give your mother ample money,\nshe’ll, of course, not feel as if she could very well with any decency\ntake you home!”",
        "“My mother won’t naturally have the audacity to be headstrong!” Hsi Jen\nventured, “not to speak besides of the nice things, which may be told\nher and the lots of money she may, in addition, be given; but were she\neven not to be paid any compliments, and not so much as a single cash\ngiven her, she won’t, if you set your mind upon keeping me here, presume\nnot to comply with your wishes, were it also against my inclination. One\nthing however; our family would never rely upon prestige, and trust upon\nhonorability to do anything so domineering as this! for this isn’t like\nanything else, which, because you take a fancy to it, a hundred per cent\nprofit can be added, and it obtained for you! This action can be well\ntaken if the seller doesn’t suffer loss! But in the present instance,\nwere they to keep me back for no rhyme or reason, it would also be of no\nbenefit to yourself; on the contrary, they would be instrumental in\nkeeping us blood relatives far apart; a thing the like of which, I feel\npositive that dowager lady Chia and my lady will never do!”",
        "After lending an ear to this argument, Pao-yü cogitated within himself\nfor a while. “From what you say,” he then observed, “when you say you’ll\ngo, it means that you’ll go for certain!”",
        "“Yes, that I’ll go for certain,” Hsi Jen rejoined.",
        "“Who would have anticipated,” Pao-yü, after these words, mused in his\nown heart, “that a person like her would have shown such little sense of\ngratitude, and such a lack of respect! Had I,” he then remarked aloud\nwith a sigh, “been aware, at an early date, that your whole wish would\nhave been to go, I wouldn’t, in that case, have brought you over! But\nwhen you’re away, I shall remain alone, a solitary spirit!”",
        "As he spoke, he lost control over his temper, and, getting into bed, he\nwent to sleep.",
        "The fact is that when Hsi Jen had been at home, and she heard her mother\nand brother express their intention of redeeming her back, she there and\nthen observed that were she even at the point of death, she would not\nreturn home. “When in past days,” she had argued, “you had no rice to\neat, there remained myself, who was still worth several taels; and\nhadn’t I urged you to sell me, wouldn’t I have seen both father and\nmother die of starvation under my very eyes? and you’ve now had the good\nfortune of selling me into this place, where I’m fed and clothed just\nlike a mistress, and where I’m not beaten by day, nor abused by night!\nBesides, though now father be no more, you two have anyhow by putting\nthings straight again, so adjusted the family estate that it has resumed\nits primitive condition. And were you, in fact, still in straitened\ncircumstances, and you could by redeeming me back, make again some more\nmoney, that would be well and good; but the truth is that there’s no\nsuch need, and what would be the use for you to redeem me at such a time\nas this? You should temporarily treat me as dead and gone, and shouldn’t\nagain recall any idea of redeeming me!”",
        "Having in consequence indulged in a loud fit of crying, her mother and\nbrother resolved, when they perceived her in this determined frame of\nmind, that for a fact there was no need for her to come out of service.\nWhat is more they had sold her under contract until death, in the\ndistinct reliance that the Chia family, charitable and generous a family\nas it was, would, possibly, after no more than a few entreaties, make\nthem a present of her person as well as the purchase money. In the\nsecond place, never had they in the Chia mansion ill-used any of those\nbelow; there being always plenty of grace and little of imperiousness.\nBesides, the servant-girls, who acted as personal attendants in the\napartments of the old as well as of the young, were treated so far\nunlike the whole body of domestics in the household that the daughters\neven of an ordinary and penniless parentage could not have been so\nlooked up to. And these considerations induced both the mother as well\nas her son to at once dispel the intention and not to redeem her, and\nwhen Pao-yü had subsequently paid them an unexpected visit, and the two\nof them (Pao-yü and Hsi Jen) were seen to be also on such terms, the\nmother and her son obtained a clearer insight into their relations, and\nstill one more burden (which had pressed on their mind) fell to the\nground, and as besides this was a contingency, which they had never\nreckoned upon, they both composed their hearts, and did not again\nentertain any idea of ransoming her.",
        "It must be noticed moreover that Hsi Jen had ever since her youth not\nbeen blind to the fact that Pao-yü had an extraordinary temperament,\nthat he was self-willed and perverse, far even in excess of all young\nlads, and that he had, in addition, a good many peculiarities and many\nunspeakable defects. And as of late he had placed such reliance in the\nfond love of his grandmother that his father and mother even could not\nexercise any extreme control over him, he had become so much the more\nremiss, dissolute, selfish and unconcerned, not taking the least\npleasure in what was proper, that she felt convinced, whenever she\nentertained the idea of tendering him advice, that he would not listen\nto her. On this day, by a strange coincidence, came about the discussion\nrespecting her ransom, and she designedly made use, in the first\ninstance, of deception with a view to ascertain his feelings, to\nsuppress his temper, and to be able subsequently to extend to him some\nwords of admonition; and when she perceived that Pao-yü had now silently\ngone to sleep, she knew that his feelings could not brook the idea of\nher return and that his temper had already subsided. She had never had,\nas far as she was concerned, any desire of eating chestnuts, but as she\nfeared lest, on account of the cream, some trouble might arise, which\nmight again lead to the same results as when Hsi Hsüeh drank the tea,\nshe consequently made use of the pretence that she fancied chestnuts, in\norder to put off Pao-yü from alluding (to the cream) and to bring the\nmatter speedily to an end. But telling forthwith the young waiting-maids\nto take the chestnuts away and eat them, she herself came and pushed\nPao-yü; but at the sight of Pao-yü with the traces of tears on his face,\nshe at once put on a smiling expression and said: “What’s there in this\nto wound your heart? If you positively do wish to keep me, I shall, of\ncourse, not go away!”",
        "Pao-yü noticed that these words contained some hidden purpose, and\nreadily observed: “Do go on and tell me what else I can do to succeed in\nkeeping you here, for of my own self I find it indeed difficult to say\nhow!”",
        "“Of our friendliness all along,” Hsi Jen smilingly rejoined, “there’s\nnaturally no need to speak; but, if you have this day made up your mind\nto retain me here, it isn’t through this friendship that you’ll succeed\nin doing so. But I’ll go on and mention three distinct conditions, and,\nif you really do accede to my wishes, you’ll then have shown an earnest\ndesire to keep me here, and I won’t go, were even a sword to be laid on\nmy neck!”",
        "“Do tell me what these conditions are,” Pao-yü pressed her with\nalacrity, as he smiled, “and I’ll assent to one and all. My dear sister,\nmy own dear sister, not to speak of two or three, but even two or three\nhundred of them I’m quite ready to accept. All I entreat you is that you\nand all of you should combine to watch over me and take care of me,\nuntil some day when I shall be transformed into flying ashes; but flying\nashes are, after all, not opportune, as they have form and substance and\nthey likewise possess sense, but until I’ve been metamorphosed into a\nstreak of subtle smoke. And when the wind shall have with one puff\ndispelled me, all of you then will be unable to attend to me, just as\nmuch as I myself won’t be able to heed you. You will, when that time\ncomes, let me go where I please, as I’ll let you speed where you choose\nto go!”",
        "These words so harassed Hsi Jen that she hastened to put her hand over\nhis mouth. “Speak decently,” she said; “I was on account of this just\nabout to admonish you, and now here you are uttering all this still more\nloathsome trash.”",
        "“I won’t utter these words again,” Pao-yü eagerly added.",
        "“This is the first fault that you must change,” Hsi Jen replied.",
        "“I’ll amend,” Pao-yü observed, “and if I say anything of the kind again\nyou can wring my mouth; but what else is there?”",
        "“The second thing is this,” Hsi Jen explained; “whether you really like\nto study or whether you only pretend to like study is immaterial; but\nyou should, when you are in the presence of master, or in the presence\nof any one else, not do nothing else than find fault with people and\nmake fun of them, but behave just as if you were genuinely fond of\nstudy, so that you shouldn’t besides provoke your father so much to\nanger, and that he should before others have also a chance of saying\nsomething! ’In my family,’ he reflects within himself, ’generation after\ngeneration has been fond of books, but ever since I’ve had you, you\nhaven’t accomplished my expectations, and not only is it that you don’t\ncare about reading books,’–and this has already filled his heart with\nanger and vexation,–’but both before my face and behind my back, you\nutter all that stuff and nonsense, and give those persons, who have,\nthrough their knowledge of letters, attained high offices, the nickname\nof the “the salaried worms.” You also uphold that there’s no work\nexclusive (of the book where appears) “fathom spotless virtue;” and that\nall other books consist of foolish compilations, which owe their origin\nto former authors, who, unable themselves to expound the writings of\nConfucius, readily struck a new line and invented original notions.’ Now\nwith words like these, how can one wonder if master loses all patience,\nand if he does from time to time give you a thrashing! and what do you\nmake other people think of you?”",
        "“I won’t say these things again,” Pao-yü laughingly protested, “these\nare the reckless and silly absurdities of a time when I was young and\nhad no idea of the height of the heavens and the thickness of the earth;\nbut I’ll now no more repeat them. What else is there besides?”",
        "“It isn’t right that you should sneer at the bonzes and vilify the\nTaoist priests, nor mix cosmetics or prepare rouge,” Hsi Jen continued;\n\"but there’s still another thing more important, you shouldn’t again\nindulge the bad habits of licking the cosmetic, applied by people on\ntheir lips, nor be fond of (girls dressed) in red!”",
        "“I’ll change in all this,” Pao-yü added by way of rejoinder; “I’ll\nchange in all this; and if there’s anything more be quick and tell me.”",
        "“There’s nothing more,” Hsi Jen observed; “but you must in everything\nexercise a little more diligence, and not indulge your caprices and\nallow your wishes to run riot, and you’ll be all right. And should you\ncomply to all these things in real earnest, you couldn’t carry me out,\neven in a chair with eight bearers.”",
        "“Well, if you do stay in here long enough,” Pao-yü remarked with a\nsmile, “there’s no fear as to your not having an eight-bearer-chair to\nsit in!”",
        "Hsi Jen gave a sardonic grin. “I don’t care much about it,” she replied;\n\"and were I even to have such good fortune, I couldn’t enjoy such a\nright. But allowing I could sit in one, there would be no pleasure in\nit!”",
        "While these two were chatting, they saw Ch’iu Wen walk in. “It’s the\nthird watch of the night,” she observed, “and you should go to sleep.\nJust a few moments back your grandmother lady Chia and our lady sent a\nnurse to ask about you, and I replied that you were asleep.”",
        "Pao-yü bade her fetch a watch, and upon looking at the time, he found\nindeed that the hand was pointing at ten; whereupon rinsing his mouth\nagain and loosening his clothes, he retired to rest, where we will leave\nhim without any further comment.",
        "The next day, Hsi Jen got up as soon as it was dawn, feeling her body\nheavy, her head sore, her eyes swollen, and her limbs burning like fire.\nShe managed however at first to keep up, an effort though it was, but as\nsubsequently she was unable to endure the strain, and all she felt\ndisposed to do was to recline, she therefore lay down in her clothes on\nthe stove-couch. Pao-yü hastened to tell dowager lady Chia, and the\ndoctor was sent for, who, upon feeling her pulse and diagnosing her\ncomplaint, declared that there was nothing else the matter with her than\na chill, which she had suddenly contracted, that after she had taken a\ndose or two of medicine, it would be dispelled, and that she would be\nquite well. After he had written the prescription and taken his\ndeparture, some one was despatched to fetch the medicines, which when\nbrought were properly decocted. As soon as she had swallowed a dose,\nPao-yü bade her cover herself with her bed-clothes so as to bring on\nperspiration; while he himself came into Tai-yü’s room to look her up.\nTai-yü was at this time quite alone, reclining on her bed having a\nmidday siesta, and the waiting-maids having all gone out to attend to\nwhatever they pleased, the whole room was plunged in stillness and\nsilence. Pao-yü raised the embroidered soft thread portiere and walked\nin; and upon espying Tai-yü in the room fast asleep, he hurriedly\napproached her and pushing her: “Dear cousin,” he said, “you’ve just had\nyour meal, and are you asleep already?” and he kept on calling “Tai-yü\"\ntill he woke her out of her sleep.",
        "Perceiving that it was Pao-yü, “You had better go for a stroll,” Tai-yü\nurged, “for the day before yesterday I was disturbed the whole night,\nand up to this day I haven’t had rest enough to get over the fatigue. My\nwhole body feels languid and sore.”",
        "“This languor and soreness,” Pao-yü rejoined, “are of no consequence;\nbut if you go on sleeping you’ll be feeling very ill; so I’ll try and\ndistract you, and when we’ve dispelled this lassitude, you’ll be all\nright.”",
        "Tai-yü closed her eyes. “I don’t feel any lassitude,” she explained,\n\"all I want is a little rest; and you had better go elsewhere and come\nback after romping about for a while.”",
        "“Where can I go?” Pao-yü asked as he pushed her. “I’m quite sick and\ntired of seeing the others.”",
        "At these words, Tai-yü burst out laughing with a sound of Ch’ih. “Well!\nsince you wish to remain here,” she added, “go over there and sit down\nquietly, and let’s have a chat.”",
        "“I’ll also recline,” Pao-yü suggested.",
        "“Well, then, recline!” Tai-yü assented.",
        "“There’s no pillow,” observed Pao-yü, “so let us lie on the same\npillow.”",
        "“What nonsense!” Tai-yü urged, “aren’t those pillows outside? get one\nand lie on it.”",
        "Pao-yü walked into the outer apartment, and having looked about him, he\nreturned and remarked with a smile: “I don’t want those, they may be,\nfor aught I know, some dirty old hag’s.”",
        "Tai-yü at this remark opened her eyes wide, and as she raised herself\nup: “You’re really,” she exclaimed laughingly, “the evil star of my\nexistence! here, please recline on this pillow!” and as she uttered\nthese words, she pushed her own pillow towards Pao-yü, and, getting up\nshe went and fetched another of her own, upon which she lay her head in\nsuch a way that both of them then reclined opposite to each other. But\nTai-yü, upon turning up her eyes and looking, espied on Pao-yü’s cheek\non the left side of his face, a spot of blood about the size of a\nbutton, and speedily bending her body, she drew near to him, and rubbing\nit with her hand, she scrutinised it closely. “Whose nail,” she went on\nto inquire, “has scratched this open?”",
        "Pao-yü with his body still reclining withdrew from her reach, and as he\ndid so, he answered with a smile: “It isn’t a scratch; it must, I\npresume, be simply a drop, which bespattered my cheek when I was just\nnow mixing and clarifying the cosmetic paste for them.”",
        "Saying this, he tried to get at his handkerchief to wipe it off; but\nTai-yü used her own and rubbed it clean for him, while she observed: “Do\nyou still give your mind to such things? attend to them you may; but\nmust you carry about you a placard (to make it public)? Though uncle\nmayn’t see it, were others to notice it, they would treat it as a\nstrange occurrence and a novel bit of news, and go and tell him to curry\nfavour, and when it has reached uncle’s ear, we shall all again not come\nout clean, and provoke him to anger.”",
        "Pao-yü did not in the least heed what she said, being intent upon\nsmelling a subtle scent which, in point of fact, emanated from Tai-yü’s\nsleeve, and when inhaled inebriated the soul and paralysed the bones.\nWith a snatch, Pao-yü laid hold of Tai-yü’s sleeve meaning to see what\nobject was concealed in it; but Tai-yü smilingly expostulated: “At such\na time as this,” she said, “who keeps scents about one?”",
        "“Well, in that case,” Pao-yü rejoined with a smirking face, “where does\nthis scent come from?”",
        "“I myself don’t know,” Tai-yü replied; “I presume it must be, there’s no\nsaying, some scent in the press which has impregnated the clothes.”",
        "“It doesn’t follow,” Pao-yü added, as he shook his head; “the fumes of\nthis smell are very peculiar, and don’t resemble the perfume of\nscent-bottles, scent-balls, or scented satchets!”",
        "“Is it likely that I have, like others, Buddhistic disciples,” Tai-yü\nasked laughing ironically, “or worthies to give me novel kinds of\nscents? But supposing there is about me some peculiar scent, I haven’t,\nat all events, any older or younger brothers to get the flowers, buds,\ndew, and snow, and concoct any for me; all I have are those common\nscents, that’s all.”",
        "“Whenever I utter any single remark,” Pao-yü urged with a grin, “you at\nonce bring up all these insinuations; but unless I deal with you\nseverely, you’ll never know what stuff I’m made of; but from henceforth\nI’ll no more show you any grace!”",
        "As he spoke, he turned himself over, and raising himself, he puffed a\ncouple of breaths into both his hands, and hastily stretching them out,\nhe tickled Tai-yü promiscuously under her armpits, and along both sides.\nTai-yü had never been able to stand tickling, so that when Pao-yü put\nout his two hands and tickled her violently, she forthwith giggled to\nsuch an extent that she could scarcely gasp for breath. “If you still go\non teasing me,” she shouted, “I’ll get angry with you!”",
        "Pao-yü then kept his hands off, and as he laughed, “Tell me,” he asked,\n\"will you again come out with all those words or not?”",
        "“I daren’t do it again,” Tai-yü smiled and adjusted her hair; adding\nwith another laugh: “I may have peculiar scents, but have you any ’warm’\nscents?”",
        "Pao-yü at this question, could not for a time unfold its meaning: “What\n’warm’ scent?” he therefore asked.",
        "Tai-yü nodded her head and smiled deridingly. “How stupid! what a fool!\"\nshe sighed; “you have jade, and another person has gold to match with\nyou, and if some one has ’cold’ scent, haven’t you any ’warm’ scent as a\nset-off?”",
        "Pao-yü at this stage alone understood the import of her remark.",
        "“A short while back you craved for mercy,” Pao-yü observed smilingly,\n\"and here you are now going on talking worse than ever;” and as he spoke\nhe again put out his hands.",
        "“Dear cousin,” Tai-yü speedily implored with a smirk, “I won’t venture\nto do it again.”",
        "“As for letting you off,” Pao-yü remarked laughing, “I’ll readily let\nyou off, but do allow me to take your sleeve and smell it!” and while\nuttering these words, he hastily pulled the sleeve, and pressing it\nagainst his face, kept on smelling it incessantly, whereupon Tai-yü drew\nher hand away and urged: “You must be going now!”",
        "“Though you may wish me to go, I can’t,” Pao-yü smiled, “so let us now\nlie down with all propriety and have a chat,” laying himself down again,\nas he spoke, while Tai-yü likewise reclined, and covered her face with\nher handkerchief. Pao-yü in a rambling way gave vent to a lot of\nnonsense, which Tai-yü did not heed, and Pao-yü went on to inquire: “How\nold she was when she came to the capital? what sights and antiquities\nshe saw on the journey? what relics and curiosities there were at Yang\nChou? what were the local customs and the habits of the people?”",
        "Tai-yü made no reply; and Pao-yü fearing lest she should go to sleep,\nand get ill, readily set to work to beguile her to keep awake. “Ai yah!\"\nhe exclaimed, “at Yang Chou, where your official residence is, has\noccurred a remarkable affair; have you heard about it?”",
        "Tai-yü perceiving that he spoke in earnest, that his words were correct\nand his face serious, imagined that what he referred to was a true\nstory, and she therefore inquired what it was?",
        "Pao-yü upon hearing her ask this question, forthwith suppressed a laugh,\nand, with a glib tongue, he began to spin a yarn. “At Yang Chou,” he\nsaid, “there’s a hill called the Tai hill; and on this hill stands a\ncave called the Lin Tzu.”",
        "“This must all be lies,” Tai-yü answered sneeringly, “as I’ve never\nbefore heard of such a hill.”",
        "“Under the heavens many are the hills and rivers,” Pao-yü rejoined, “and\nhow could you know them all? Wait until I’ve done speaking, when you\nwill be free to express your opinion!”",
        "“Go on then,” Tai-yü suggested, whereupon Pao-yü prosecuted his\nraillery. “In this Lin Tzu cave,” he said, “there was once upon a time a\nwhole swarm of rat-elves. In some year or other and on the seventh day\nof the twelfth moon, an old rat ascended the throne to discuss matters.\n’Tomorrow,’ he argued, ’is the eighth of the twelfth moon, and men in\nthe world will all be cooking the congee of the eighth of the twelfth\nmoon. We have now in our cave a short supply of fruits of all kinds, and\nit would be well that we should seize this opportunity to steal a few\nand bring them over.’ Drawing a mandatory arrow, he handed it to a\nsmall rat, full of aptitude, to go forward on a tour of inspection. The\nyoung rat on his return reported that he had already concluded his\nsearch and inquiries in every place and corner, and that in the temple\nat the bottom of the hill alone was the largest stock of fruits and\nrice. ’How many kinds of rice are there?’ the old rat ascertained, ’and\nhow many species of fruits?’ ’Rice and beans,’ the young rat rejoined,\n’how many barns-full there are, I can’t remember; but in the way of\nfruits there are five kinds: 1st, red dates; 2nd, chestnuts; 3rd, ground\nnuts; 4th, water caltrops, and 5th, scented taros.’ At this report the\nold rat was so much elated that he promptly detailed rats to go forth;\nand as he drew the mandatory arrow, and inquired who would go and steal\nthe rice, a rat readily received the order and went off to rob the rice.\nDrawing another mandatory arrow, he asked who would go and abstract the\nbeans, when once more a rat took over the arrow and started to steal the\nbeans; and one by one subsequently received each an arrow and started on\nhis errand. There only remained the scented taros, so that picking again\na mandatory arrow, he ascertained who would go and carry away the taros:\nwhereupon a very puny and very delicate rat was heard to assent. ’I\nwould like,’ he said, ’to go and steal the scented taros.’ The old rat\nand all the swarm of rats, upon noticing his state, feared that he would\nnot be sufficiently expert, and apprehending at the same time that he\nwas too weakly and too devoid of energy, they one and all would not\nallow him to proceed. ’Though I be young in years and though my frame be\ndelicate,’ the wee rat expostulated, ’my devices are unlimited, my talk\nis glib and my designs deep and farseeing; and I feel convinced that, on\nthis errand, I shall be more ingenious in pilfering than any of them.’\n’How could you be more ingenious than they?’ the whole company of rats\nasked. ’I won’t,’ explained the young rat, ’follow their example, and go\nstraight to work and steal, but by simply shaking my body, and\ntransforming myself, I shall metamorphose myself into a taro, and roll\nmyself among the heap of taros, so that people will not be able to\ndetect me, and to hear me; whereupon I shall stealthily, by means of the\nmagic art of dividing my body into many, begin the removal, and little\nby little transfer the whole lot away, and will not this be far more\ningenious than any direct pilfering or forcible abstraction?’ After the\nwhole swarm of rats had listened to what he had to say, they, with one\nvoice, exclaimed: ’Excellent it is indeed, but what is this art of\nmetamorphosis we wonder? Go forth you may, but first transform yourself\nand let us see you.’ At these words the young rat laughed. ’This isn’t a\nhard task!’ he observed, ’wait till I transform myself.’",
        "“Having done speaking, he shook his body and shouted out ’transform,’\nwhen he was converted into a young girl, most beauteous and with a most\nlovely face.",
        "“’You’ve transformed yourself into the wrong thing,’ all the rats\npromptly added deridingly; ’you said that you were to become a fruit,\nand how is it that you’ve turned into a young lady?’",
        "“The young rat in its original form rejoined with a sneering smile: ’You\nall lack, I maintain, experience of the world; what you simply are aware\nof is that this fruit is the scented taro, but have no idea that the\nyoung daughter of Mr. Lin, of the salt tax, is, in real truth, a genuine\nscented taro.’”",
        "Tai-yü having listened to this story, turned herself round and raising\nherself, she observed laughing, while she pushed Pao-yü: “I’ll take that\nmouth of yours and pull it to pieces! Now I see that you’ve been\nimposing upon me.”",
        "With these words on her lips, she readily gave him a pinch, and Pao-yü\nhastened to plead for mercy. “My dear cousin,” he said, “spare me; I\nwon’t presume to do it again; and it’s when I came to perceive this\nperfume of yours, that I suddenly bethought myself of this old story.”",
        "“You freely indulge in abusing people,” Tai-yü added with a smile, “and\nthen go on to say that it’s an old story.”",
        "But hardly had she concluded this remark before they caught sight of\nPao-ch’ai walk in. “Who has been telling old stories?” she asked with a\nbeaming face; “do let me also hear them.”",
        "Tai-yü pressed her at once into a seat. “Just see for yourself who else\nbesides is here!” she smiled; “he goes in for profuse abuses and then\nmaintains that it’s an old story!”",
        "“Is it indeed cousin Pao-yü?” Pao-ch’ai remarked. “Well, one can’t feel\nsurprised at his doing it; for many have ever been the stories stored up\nin his brain. The only pity is that when he should make use of old\nstories, he invariably forgets them! To-day, he can easily enough recall\nthem to mind, but in the stanza of the other night on the banana leaves,\nwhen he should have remembered them, he couldn’t after all recollect\nwhat really stared him in the face! and while every one else seemed so\ncool, he was in such a flurry that he actually perspired! And yet, at\nthis moment, he happens once again to have a memory!”",
        "At these words, Tai-yü laughed. “O-mi-to-fu!” she exclaimed. “You are\nindeed my very good cousin! But you’ve also (to Pao-yü) come across your\nmatch. And this makes it clear that requital and retribution never fail\nor err.”",
        "She had just reached this part of her sentence, when in Pao-yü’s rooms\nwas heard a continuous sound of wrangling; but as what transpired is not\nyet known, the ensuing chapter will explain.",
        "  Wang Hsi-feng with earnest words upbraids Mrs. Chao’s jealous notions.\n  Lin Tai-yü uses specious language to make sport of Shih Hsiang-yün’s\n      querulous tone of voice.",
        "But to continue. Pao-yü was in Tai yü’s apartments relating about the\nrat-elves, when Pao-ch’ai entered unannounced, and began to gibe Pao-yü,\nwith trenchant irony: how that on the fifteenth of the first moon, he\nhad shown ignorance of the allusion to the green wax; and the three of\nthem then indulged in that room in mutual poignant satire, for the sake\nof fun. Pao-yü had been giving way to solicitude lest Tai-yü should, by\nbeing bent upon napping soon after her meal, be shortly getting an\nindigestion, or lest sleep should, at night, be completely dispelled, as\nneither of these things were conducive to the preservation of good\nhealth, when luckily Pao-ch’ai walked in, and they chatted and laughed\ntogether; and when Lin Tai-yü at length lost all inclination to dose, he\nhimself then felt composed in his mind. But suddenly they heard\nclamouring begin in his room, and after they had all lent an ear and\nlistened, Lin Tai-yü was the first to smile and make a remark. “It’s\nyour nurse having a row with Hsi Jen!” she said. “Hsi Jen treats her\nwell enough, but that nurse of yours would also like to keep her well\nunder her thumb; she’s indeed an old dotard;” and Pao-yü was anxious to\ngo over at once, but Pao-ch’ai laid hold of him and kept him back,\nsuggesting: “It’s as well that you shouldn’t wrangle with your nurse,\nfor she’s quite stupid from old age; and it’s but fair, on the contrary,\nthat you should bear with her a little.”",
        "“I know all about that!” Pao-yü rejoined. But having concluded this\nremark, he walked into his room, where he discovered nurse Li, leaning\non her staff, standing in the centre of the floor, abusing Hsi Jen,\nsaying: “You young wench! how utterly unmindful you are of your origin!\nIt’s I who’ve raised you up, and yet, when I came just now, you put on\nhigh airs and mighty side, and remained reclining on the stove-couch!\nYou saw me well enough, but you paid not the least heed to me! Your\nwhole heart is set upon acting like a wily enchantress to befool Pao-yü;\nand you so impose upon Pao-yü that he doesn’t notice me, but merely\nlends an ear to what you people have to say! You’re no more than a low\ngirl bought for a few taels and brought in here; and will it ever do\nthat you should be up to your mischievous tricks in this room? But\nwhether you like it or not, I’ll drag you out from this, and give you to\nsome mean fellow, and we’ll see whether you will still behave like a\nvery imp, and cajole people or not?”",
        "Hsi Jen was, at first, under the simple impression that the nurse was\nwrath for no other reason than because she remained lying down, and she\nfelt constrained to explain that “she was unwell, that she had just\nsucceeded in perspiring, and that having had her head covered, she\nhadn’t really perceived the old lady;” but when she came subsequently to\nhear her mention that she imposed upon Pao-yü, and also go so far as to\nadd that she would be given to some mean fellow, she unavoidably\nexperienced both a sense of shame and injury, and found it impossible to\nrestrain herself from beginning to cry.",
        "Pao-yü had, it is true, caught all that had been said, but unable with\nany propriety to take notice of it, he thought it his duty to explain\nmatters for her. “She’s ill,” he observed, “and is taking medicines; and\nif you don’t believe it,” he went on, “well then ask the rest of the\nservant-girls.”",
        "Nurse Li at these words flew into a more violent dudgeon. “Your sole\ndelight is to screen that lot of sly foxes!” she remarked, “and do you\npay any notice to me? No, none at all! and whom would you like me to go\nand ask; who’s it that doesn’t back you? and who hasn’t been dismounted\nfrom her horse by Hsi Jen? I know all about it; but I’ll go with you and\nexplain all these matters to our old mistress and my lady; for I’ve\nnursed you till I’ve brought you to this age, and now that you don’t\nfeed on milk, you thrust me on one side, and avail yourself of the\nservant-girls, in your wish to browbeat me.”",
        "As she uttered this remark, she too gave way to tears, but by this time,\nTai-yü and Pao-ch’ai had also come over, and they set to work to\nreassure her. “You, old lady,” they urged, “should bear with them a\nlittle, and everything will be right!” And when nurse Li saw these two\narrive, she hastened to lay bare her grievances to them; and taking up\nthe question of the dismissal in days gone by, of Hsi Hsüeh, for having\ndrunk some tea, of the cream eaten on the previous day, and other\nsimilar matters, she spun a long, interminable yarn.",
        "By a strange coincidence lady Feng was at this moment in the upper\nrooms, where she had been making up the account of losses and winnings,\nand upon hearing at the back a continuous sound of shouting and\nbustling, she readily concluded that nurse Li’s old complaint was\nbreaking forth, and that she was finding fault with Pao-yü’s servants.\nBut she had, as luck would have it, lost money in gambling on this\noccasion, so that she was ready to visit her resentment upon others.\nWith hurried step, she forthwith came over, and laying hold of nurse Li,\n\"Nurse,” she said smiling, “don’t lose your temper, on a great festival\nlike this, and after our venerable lady has just gone through a day in\nexcellent spirits! You’re an old dame, and should, when others get up a\nrow, still do what is right and keep them in proper order; and aren’t\nyou, instead of that, aware what good manners imply, that you will start\nvociferating in this place, and make our dowager lady full of\ndispleasure? Tell me who’s not good, and I’ll beat her for you; but be\nquick and come along with me over to my quarters, where a pheasant which\nthey have roasted is scalding hot, and let us go and have a glass of\nwine!” And as she spoke, she dragged her along and went on her way.\n\"Feng Erh,” she also called, “hold the staff for your old lady Li, and\nthe handkerchief to wipe her tears with!” While nurse Li walked along\nwith lady Feng, her feet scarcely touched the ground, as she kept on\nsaying: “I don’t really attach any value to this decrepid existence of\nmine! and I had rather disregard good manners, have a row and lose face,\nas it’s better, it seems to me, than to put up with the temper of that\nwench!”",
        "Behind followed Pao-ch’ai and Tai-yü, and at the sight of the way in\nwhich lady Feng dealt with her, they both clapped their hands, and\nexclaimed, laughing, “What piece of luck that this gust of wind has\ncome, and dragged away this old matron!” while Pao-yü nodded his head to\nand fro and soliloquised with a sigh: “One can neither know whence\noriginates this score; for she will choose the weak one to maltreat; nor\ncan one see what girl has given her offence that she has come to be put\nin her black books!”",
        "Scarcely had he ended this remark, before Ch’ing Wen, who stood by, put\nin her word. “Who’s gone mad again?” she interposed, “and what good\nwould come by hurting her feelings? But did even any one happen to hurt\nher, she would have pluck enough to bear the brunt, and wouldn’t act so\nimproperly as to involve others!”",
        "Hsi Jen wept, and as she, did so, she drew Pao-yü towards her: “All\nthrough my having aggrieved an old nurse,” she urged, “you’ve now again\ngiven umbrage, entirely on my account, to this crowd of people; and\nisn’t this still enough for me to bear but must you also go and drag in\nthird parties?”",
        "When Pao-yü realised that to this sickness of hers, had also been\nsuperadded all these annoyances, he promptly stifled his resentment,\nsuppressed his voice and consoled her so far as to induce her to lie\ndown again to perspire. And when he further noticed how scalding like\nsoup and burning like fire she was, he himself watched by her, and\nreclining by her side, he tried to cheer her, saying: “All you must do\nis to take good care of your ailment; and don’t give your mind to those\ntrifling matters, and get angry.”",
        "“Were I,” Hsi Jen smiled sardonically, “to lose my temper over such\nconcerns, would I be able to stand one moment longer in this room? The\nonly thing is that if she goes on, day after day, doing nothing else\nthan clamour in this manner, how can she let people get along? But you\nrashly go and hurt people’s feelings for our sakes; but they’ll bear it\nin mind, and when they find an opportunity, they’ll come out with what’s\neasy enough to say, but what’s not pleasant to hear, and how will we all\nfeel then?”",
        "While her mouth gave utterance to these words, she could not stop her\ntears from running; but fearful, on the other hand, lest Pao-yü should\nbe annoyed, she felt compelled to again strain every nerve to repress\nthem. But in a short while, the old matrons employed for all sorts of\nduties, brought in some mixture of two drugs; and, as Pao-yü noticed\nthat she was just on the point of perspiring, he did not allow her to\nget up, but readily taking it up to her, she immediately swallowed it,\nwith her head still on her pillow; whereupon he gave speedy directions\nto the young servant-maids to lay her stove-couch in order.",
        "“Whether you mean to have anything to eat or not,” Hsi Jen advised, “you\nshould after all sit for a time with our old mistress and our lady, and\nhave a romp with the young ladies; after which you can come back again;\nwhile I, by quietly keeping lying down, will also feel the better.”",
        "When Pao-yü heard this suggestion, he had no help but to accede, and,\nafter she had divested herself of her hair-pins and earrings, and he saw\nher lie down, he betook himself into the drawing-rooms, where he had his\nrepast with old lady Chia. But the meal over, her ladyship felt still\ndisposed to play at cards with the nurses, who had looked after the\nhousehold for many years; and Pao-yü, bethinking himself of Hsi Jen,\nhastened to return to his apartments; where seeing that Hsi Jen was\ndrowsily falling asleep, he himself would have wished to go to bed, but\nthe hour was yet early. And as about this time Ch’ing Wen, I Hsia, Ch’in\nWen, Pi Hen had all, in their desire of getting some excitement, started\nin search of Yüan Yang, Hu Po and their companions, to have a romp with\nthem, and he espied She Yüeh alone in the outer room, having a game of\ndominoes by lamp-light, Pao-yü inquired full of smiles: “How is it you\ndon’t go with them?”",
        "“I’ve no money,” She Yüeh replied.",
        "“Under the bed,” continued Pao-yü, “is heaped up all that money, and\nisn’t it enough yet for you to lose from?”",
        "“Had we all gone to play,” She Yüeh added, “to whom would the charge of\nthis apartment have been handed over? That other one is sick again, and\nthe whole room is above, one mass of lamps, and below, full of fire; and\nall those old matrons, ancient as the heavens, should, after all their\nexertions in waiting upon you from morning to night, be also allowed\nsome rest; while the young servant girls, on the other hand, have\nlikewise been on duty the whole day long, and shouldn’t they even at\nthis hour be left to go and have some distraction? and that’s why I am\nin here on watch.”",
        "When Pao-yü heard these words, which demonstrated distinctly that she\nwas another Hsi Jen, he consequently put on a smile and remarked: “I’ll\nsit in here, so you had better set your mind at ease and go!”",
        "“Since you remain in here, there’s less need for me to go,” resumed She\nYüeh, “for we two can chat and play and laugh; and won’t that be nice?”",
        "“What can we two do? it will be awfully dull! but never mind,” Pao-yü\nrejoined; “this morning you said that your head itched, and now that you\nhave nothing to do, I may as well comb it for you.”",
        "“Yes! do so!” readily assented She Yüeh, upon catching what he\nsuggested; and while still speaking, she brought over the dressing-case\ncontaining a set of small drawers and looking-glass, and taking off her\nornaments, she dishevelled her hair; whereupon Pao-yü picked up the fine\ncomb and passed it repeatedly through her hair; but he had only combed\nit three or five times, when he perceived Ch’ing Wen hurriedly walk in\nto fetch some money. As soon as she caught sight of them both: “You\nhaven’t as yet drunk from the marriage cup,” she said with a smile full\nof irony, “and have you already put up your hair?”",
        "“Now that you’ve come, let me also comb yours for you,” Pao-yü\ncontinued.",
        "“I’m not blessed with such excessive good fortune!” Ch’ing Wen retorted,\nand as she uttered these words, she took the money, and forthwith\ndashing the portiere after her, she quitted the room.",
        "Pao-yü stood at the back of She Yüeh, and She Yüeh sat opposite the\nglass, so that the two of them faced each other in it, and Pao-yü\nreadily observed as he gazed in the glass, “In the whole number of rooms\nshe’s the only one who has a glib tongue!”",
        "She Yüeh at these words hastily waved her hand towards the inside of the\nglass, and Pao-yü understood the hint; and suddenly a sound of “hu” was\nheard from the portiere, and Ch’ing Wen ran in once again.",
        "“How have I got a glib tongue?” she inquired; “it would be well for us\nto explain ourselves.”",
        "“Go after your business, and have done,” She Yüeh interposed laughingly;\n\"what’s the use of your coming and asking questions of people?”",
        "“Will you also screen him?” Ch’ing Wen smiled significantly; “I know all\nabout your secret doings, but wait until I’ve got back my capital, and\nwe’ll then talk matters over!”",
        "With this remark still on her lips, she straightway quitted the room,\nand during this while, Pao-yü having finished combing her hair, asked\nShe Yüeh to quietly wait upon him, while he went to sleep, as he would\nnot like to disturb Hsi Jen.\r\n\r\nOf the whole night there is nothing to record. But the next day, when he\ngot up at early dawn, Hsi Jen had already perspired, during the night,\nso that she felt considerably lighter and better; but limiting her diet\nto a little rice soup, she remained quiet and nursed herself, and Pao-yü\nwas so relieved in mind that he came, after his meal, over on this side\nto his aunt Hsüeh’s on a saunter. The season was the course of the first\nmoon, and the school was shut up for the new year holidays; while in the\ninner chambers the girls had put by their needlework, and were all\nhaving a time of leisure, and hence it was that when Chia Huan too came\nover in search of distraction, he discovered Pao-ch’ai, Hsiang Ling,\nYing Erh, the three of them, in the act of recreating themselves by\nplaying at chess. Chia Huan, at the sight of them, also wished to join\nin their games; and Pao-ch’ai, who had always looked upon him with, in\nfact, the same eye as she did Pao-yü, and with no different sentiment of\nany kind, pressed him to come up, upon hearing that he was on this\noccasion desirous to play; and, when he had seated himself together with\nthem, they began to gamble, staking each time a pile of ten cash. The\nfirst time, he was the winner, and he felt supremely elated at heart,\nbut as it happened that he subsequently lost in several consecutive\ngames he soon became a prey to considerable distress. But in due course\ncame the game in which it was his turn to cast the dice, and, if in\nthrowing, he got seven spots, he stood to win, but he was likewise bound\nto be a winner were he to turn up six; and when Ying Erh had turned up\nthree spots and lost, he consequently took up the dice, and dashing them\nwith spite, one of them settled at five; and, as the other reeled wildly\nabout, Ying Erh clapped her hands, and kept on shouting, “one spot;\"\nwhile Chia Huan at once gazed with fixed eye and cried at random: “It’s\nsix, it’s seven, it’s eight!” But the dice, as it happened, turned up at\none spot, and Chia Huan was so exasperated that putting out his hand, he\nspeedily made a snatch at the dice, and eventually was about to lay hold\nof the money, arguing that it was six spot. But Ying Erh expostulated,\n\"It was distinctly an ace,” she said. And as Pao-ch’ai noticed how\ndistressed Chia Huan was, she forthwith cast a glance at Ying Erh and\nobserved: “The older you get, the less manners you have! Is it likely\nthat gentlemen will cheat you? and don’t you yet put down the money?”",
        "Ying Erh felt her whole heart much aggrieved, but as she heard Pao-ch’ai\nmake these remarks, she did not presume to utter a sound, and as she was\nunder the necessity of laying down the cash, she muttered to herself:\n\"This one calls himself a gentleman, and yet cheats us of these few\ncash, for which I myself even have no eye! The other day when I played\nwith Mr. Pao-yü, he lost ever so many, and yet he did not distress\nhimself! and what remained of the cash were besides snatched away by a\nfew servant-girls, but all he did was to smile, that’s all!”",
        "Pao-ch’ai did not allow her time to complete what she had to say, but\nthere and then called her to account and made her desist; whereupon Chia\nHuan exclaimed: “How can I compare with Pao-yü; you all fear him, and\nkeep on good terms with him, while you all look down upon me for not\nbeing the child of my lady.” And as he uttered these words, he at once\ngave way to tears.",
        "“My dear cousin,” Pao-ch’ai hastened to advise him, “leave off at once\nlanguage of this kind, for people will laugh at you;” and then went on\nto scold Ying Erh, when Pao-yü just happened to come in. Perceiving him\nin this plight, “What is the matter?” he asked; but Chia Huan had not\nthe courage to say anything.",
        "Pao-ch’ai was well aware of the custom, which prevailed in their family,\nthat younger brothers lived in respect of the elder brothers, but she\nwas not however cognisant of the fact that Pao-yü would not that any one\nshould entertain any fear of him. His idea being that elder as well as\nyounger brothers had, all alike, father and mother to admonish them, and\nthat there was no need for any of that officiousness, which, instead of\ndoing good gave, on the contrary, rise to estrangement. “Besides,” (he\nreasoned,) “I’m the offspring of the primary wife, while he’s the son of\nthe secondary wife, and, if by treating him as leniently as I have done,\nthere are still those to talk about me, behind my back, how could I\nexercise any control over him?” But besides these, there were other\nstill more foolish notions, which he fostered in his mind; but what\nfoolish notions they were can you, reader, guess? As a result of his\ngrowing up, from his early youth, among a crowd of girls, of whom, in\nthe way of sister, there was Yüan Ch’un, of cousins, from his paternal\nuncle’s side, there were Ying Ch’un, and Hsi Ch’un, and of relatives\nalso there were Shih Hsiang-yün, Lin Tai-yü, Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai and the\nrest, he, in due course, resolved in his mind that the divine and\nunsullied virtue of Heaven and earth was only implanted in womankind,\nand that men were no more than feculent dregs and foul dirt. And for\nthis reason it was that men were without discrimination, considered by\nhim as so many filthy objects, which might or might not exist; while the\nrelationships of father, paternal uncles, and brothers, he did not\nhowever presume to disregard, as these were among the injunctions\nbequeathed by the holy man, and he felt bound to listen to a few of\r\ntheir precepts. But to the above causes must be assigned the fact that,\namong his brothers, he did no more than accomplish the general purport\nof the principle of human affections; bearing in mind no thought\nwhatever that he himself was a human being of the male sex, and that it\nwas his duty to be an example to his younger brothers. And this is why\nChia Huan and the others entertained no respect for him, though in their\nveneration for dowager lady Chia, they yielded to him to a certain\ndegree.",
        "Pao-ch’ai harboured fears lest, on this occasion, Pao-yü should call him\nto book, and put him out of face, and she there and then lost no time in\ntaking Chia Huan’s part with a view to screening him.",
        "“In this felicitous first moon what are you blubbering for?” Pao-yü\ninquired, “if this place isn’t nice, why then go somewhere else to play.\nBut from reading books, day after day, you’ve studied so much that\nyou’ve become quite a dunce. If this thing, for instance, isn’t good,\nthat must, of course, be good, so then discard this and take up that,\nbut is it likely that by sticking to this thing and crying for a while\nthat it will become good? You came originally with the idea of reaping\nsome fun, and you’ve instead provoked yourself to displeasure, and isn’t\nit better then that you should be off at once.”",
        "Chia Huan upon hearing these words could not but come back to his\nquarters; and Mrs. Chao noticing the frame of mind in which he was felt\nconstrained to inquire: “Where is it that you’ve been looked down upon\nby being made to fill up a hole, and being trodden under foot?”",
        "“I was playing with cousin Pao-ch’ai,” Chia Huan readily replied, “when\nYing Erh insulted me, and deprived me of my money, and brother Pao-yü\ndrove me away.”",
        "“Ts’ui!” exclaimed Mrs. Chao, “who bade you (presume so high) as to get\nup into that lofty tray? You low and barefaced thing! What place is\nthere that you can’t go to and play; and who told you to run over there\nand bring upon yourself all this shame?”",
        "As she spoke, lady Feng was, by a strange coincidence, passing outside\nunder the window; so that every word reached her ear, and she speedily\nasked from outside the window: “What are you up to in this happy first\nmoon? These brothers are, really, but mere children, and will you just\nfor a slight mistake, go on preaching to him! what’s the use of coming\nout with all you’ve said? Let him go wherever he pleases; for there are\nstill our lady and Mr. Chia Cheng to keep him in order. But you go and\nsputter him with your gigantic mouth; he’s at present a master, and if\nthere be anything wrong about him, there are, after all, those to rate\nhim; and what business is that of yours? Brother Huan, come out with\nyou, and follow me and let us go and enjoy ourselves.”",
        "Chia Huan had ever been in greater fear and trembling of lady Feng, than\nof madame Wang, so that when her summons reached his ear, he hurriedly\nwent out, while Mrs. Chao, on the other hand, did not venture to breathe\na single word.",
        "“You too,” resumed lady Feng, addressing Chia Huan; “are a thing devoid\nof all natural spirit! I’ve often told you that if you want to eat,\ndrink, play, or laugh, you were quite free to go and play with whatever\nfemale cousin, male cousin, or sister-in-law you choose to disport\nyourself with; but you won’t listen to my words. On the contrary, you\nlet all these persons teach you to be depraved in your heart, perverse\nin your mind, to be sly, artful, and domineering; and you’ve, besides,\nno respect for your own self, but will go with that low-bred lot! and\nyour perverse purpose is to begrudge people’s preferences! But what\nyou’ve lost are simply a few cash, and do you behave in this manner? How\nmuch did you lose?” she proceeded to ask Chia Huan; and Chia Huan, upon\nhearing this question, felt constrained to obey, by saying something in\nthe way of a reply. “I’ve lost,” he explained, “some hundred or two\nhundred cash.”",
        "“You have,” rejoined lady Feng, “the good fortune of being a gentleman,\nand do you make such a fuss for the loss of a hundred or two hundred\ncash!” and turning her head round, “Feng Erh,” she added, “go and fetch\na thousand cash; and as the girls are all playing at the back, take him\nalong to go and play. And if again by and by, you’re so mean and\ndeceitful, I shall, first of all, beat you, and then tell some one to\nreport it at school, and won’t your skin be flayed for you? All because\nof this want of respect of yours, your elder cousin is so angry with you\nthat his teeth itch; and were it not that I prevent him, he would hit\nyou with his foot in the stomach and kick all your intestines out! Get\naway,” she then cried; whereupon Chia Huan obediently followed Feng Erh,\nand taking the money he went all by himself to play with Ying Ch’un and\nthe rest; where we shall leave him without another word.",
        "But to return to Pao-yü. He was just amusing himself and laughing with\nPao-ch’ai, when at an unexpected moment, he heard some one announce that\nMiss Shih had come. At these words, Pao-yü rose, and was at once going\noff when “Wait,” shouted Pao-ch’ai with a smile, “and we’ll go over\ntogether and see her.”",
        "Saying this, she descended from the stove-couch, and came, in company\nwith Pao-yü, to dowager lady Chia’s on this side, where they saw Shih\nHsiang-yün laughing aloud, and talking immoderately; and upon catching\nsight of them both, she promptly inquired after their healths, and\nexchanged salutations.",
        "Lin Tai-yü just happened to be standing by, and having set the question\nto Pao-yü “Where do you come from?” “I come from cousin Pao-ch’ai’s\nrooms,” Pao-yü readily replied.",
        "Tai-yü gave a sardonic smile. “What I maintain is this,” she rejoined,\n\"that lucky enough for you, you were detained over there; otherwise, you\nwould long ago have, at once, come flying in here!”",
        "“Am I only free to play with you?” Pao-yü inquired, “and to dispel your\nennui! I simply went over to her place for a run, and that quite\ncasually, and will you insinuate all these things?”",
        "“Your words are quite devoid of sense,” Tai-yü added; “whether you go or\nnot what’s that to me? neither did I tell you to give me any\ndistraction; you’re quite at liberty from this time forth not to pay any\nnotice to me!”",
        "Saying this, she flew into a high dudgeon and rushed back into her room;\nbut Pao-yü promptly followed in her footsteps: “Here you are again in a\nhuff,” he urged, “and all for no reason! Had I even passed any remark\nthat I shouldn’t, you should anyhow have still sat in there, and chatted\nand laughed with the others for a while; instead of that, you come again\nto sit and mope all alone!”",
        "“Are you my keeper?” Tai-yü expostulated.",
        "“I couldn’t, of course,” Pao-yü smiled, “presume to exercise any\ninfluence over you; but the only thing is that you are doing your own\nhealth harm!”",
        "“If I do ruin my health,” Tai-yü rejoined, “and I die, it’s my own\nlookout! what’s that to do with you?”",
        "“What’s the good,” protested Pao-yü, “of talking in this happy first\nmoon of dying and of living?”",
        "“I will say die,” insisted Tai-yü, “die now, at this very moment!\nbut you’re afraid of death; and you may live a long life of a hundred\nyears, but what good will that be!”",
        "“If all we do is to go on nagging in this way,” Pao-yü remarked smiling,\n\"will I any more be afraid to die? on the contrary, it would be better\nto die, and be free!”",
        "“Quite so!” continued Tai-yü with alacrity, “if we go on nagging in this\nway, it would be better for me to die, and that you should be free of\nme!”",
        "“I speak of my own self dying,” Pao-yü added, “so don’t misunderstand my\nwords and accuse people wrongly.”",
        "While he was as yet speaking, Pao-ch’ai entered the room: “Cousin Shih\nis waiting for you;” she said; and with these words, she hastily pushed\nPao-yü on, and they walked away.",
        "Tai-yü, meanwhile, became more and more a prey to resentment; and\ndisconsolate as she felt, she shed tears in front of the window. But not\ntime enough had transpired to allow two cups of tea to be drunk, before\nPao-yü came back again. At the sight of him, Tai-yü sobbed still more\nfervently and incessantly, and Pao-yü realising the state she was in,\nand knowing well enough how arduous a task it would be to bring her\nround, began to join together a hundred, yea a thousand kinds of soft\nphrases and tender words to console her. But at an unforeseen moment,\nand before he could himself open his mouth, he heard Tai-yü anticipate\nhim.",
        "“What have you come back again for?” she asked. “Let me die or live, as\nI please, and have done! You’ve really got at present some one to play\nwith you, one who, compared with me, is able to read and able to\ncompose, able to write, to speak, as well as to joke, one too who for\nfear lest you should have ruffled your temper dragged you away: and what\ndo you return here for now?”",
        "Pao-yü, after listening to all she had to say, hastened to come up to\nher. “Is it likely,” he observed in a low tone of voice, “that an\nintelligent person like you isn’t so much as aware that near relatives\ncan’t be separated by a distant relative, and a remote friend set aside\nan old friend! I’m stupid, there’s no gainsaying, but I do anyhow\nunderstand what these two sentiments imply. You and I are, in the first\nplace, cousins on my father’s sister’s side; while sister Pao-ch’ai and\nI are two cousins on mother’s sides, so that, according to the degrees\nof relationship, she’s more distant than yourself. In the second place,\nyou came here first, and we two have our meals at one table and sleep in\none bed, having ever since our youth grown up together; while she has\nonly recently come, and how could I ever distance you on her account?”",
        "“Ts’ui!” Tai-yü exclaimed. “Will I forsooth ever make you distance her!\nwho and what kind of person have I become to do such a thing? What (I\nsaid) was prompted by my own motives.”",
        "“I too,” Pao-yü urged, “made those remarks prompted by my own heart’s\nmotives, and do you mean to say that your heart can only read the\nfeelings of your own heart, and has no idea whatsoever of my own?”",
        "Tai-yü at these words, lowered her head and said not a word. But after a\nlong interval, “You only know,” she continued, “how to feel bitter\nagainst people for their action in censuring you: but you don’t, after\nall, know that you yourself provoke people to such a degree, that it’s\nhard for them to put up with it! Take for instance the weather of to-day\nas an example. It’s distinctly very cold, to-day, and yet, how is it\nthat you are so contrary as to go and divest yourself of the pelisse\nwith the bluish breast-fur overlapping the cloth?”",
        "“Why say I didn’t wear it?” Pao-yü smilingly observed. “I did, but\nseeing you get angry I felt suddenly in such a terrible blaze, that I at\nonce took it off!”",
        "Tai-yü heaved a sigh. “You’ll by and by catch a cold,” she remarked,\n\"and then you’ll again have to starve, and vociferate for something to\neat!”",
        "While these two were having this colloquy, Hsiang-yün was seen to walk\nin! “You two, Ai cousin and cousin Lin,” she ventured jokingly, “are\ntogether playing every day, and though I’ve managed to come after ever\nso much trouble, you pay no heed to me at all!”",
        "“It’s invariably the rule,” Tai-yü retorted smilingly, “that those who\nhave a defect in their speech will insist upon talking; she can’t even\ncome out correctly with ’Erh’ (secundus) cousin, and keeps on calling\nhim ’Ai’ cousin, ’Ai’ cousin! And by and by when you play ’Wei Ch’i’\nyou’re sure also to shout out yao, ai, (instead of erh), san; (one, two,\nthree).”",
        "Pao-yü laughed. “If you imitate her,” he interposed, “and get into that\nhabit, you’ll also begin to bite your tongue when you talk.”",
        "“She won’t make even the slightest allowance for any one,” Hsiang-yün\nrejoined; “her sole idea being to pick out others’ faults. You may\nreadily be superior to any mortal being, but you shouldn’t, after all,\noffend against what’s right and make fun of every person you come\nacross! But I’ll point out some one, and if you venture to jeer her,\nI’ll at once submit to you.”",
        "“Who is it?” Tai-yü vehemently inquired.",
        "“If you do have the courage,” Hsiang-yün answered, “to pick out cousin\nPao-ch’ai’s faults, you then may well be held to be first-rate!”",
        "Tai-yü after hearing these words, gave a sarcastic smile. “I was\nwondering,” she observed, “who it was. Is it indeed she? How could I\never presume to pick out hers?”",
        "Pao-yü allowed her no time to finish, but hastened to say something to\ninterrupt the conversation.",
        "“I couldn’t, of course, during the whole of this my lifetime,\"\nHsiang-yün laughed, “attain your standard! but my earnest wish is that\nby and by should be found for you, cousin Lin, a husband, who bites his\ntongue when he speaks, so that you should every minute and second listen\nto ’ai-ya-os!’ O-mi-to-fu, won’t then your reward be manifest to my\neyes!”",
        "As she made this remark, they all burst out laughing heartily, and\nHsiang-yün speedily turned herself round and ran away.",
        "But reader, do you want to know the sequel? Well, then listen to the\nexplanation given in the next chapter.",
        "  The eminent Hsi Jen, with winsome ways, rails at Pao-yü, with a view\n      to exhortation.\n  The beauteous P’ing Erh, with soft words, screens Chia Lien.",
        "But to resume our story. When Shih Hsiang-yün ran out of the room, she\nwas all in a flutter lest Lin Tai-yü should catch her up; but Pao-yü,\nwho came after her, readily shouted out, “You’ll trip and fall. How ever\ncould she come up to you?”",
        "Lin Tai-yü went in pursuit of her as far as the entrance, when she was\nimpeded from making further progress by Pao-yü, who stretched his arms\nout against the posts of the door.",
        "“Were I to spare Yün Erh, I couldn’t live!” Lin Tai-yü exclaimed, as she\ntugged at his arms. But Hsiang-yün, perceiving that Pao-yü obstructed\nthe door, and surmising that Tai-yü could not come out, speedily stood\nstill. “My dear cousin,” she smilingly pleaded, “do let me off this\ntime!”",
        "But it just happened that Pao-ch’ai, who was coming along, was at the\nback of Hsiang-yün, and with a face also beaming with smiles: “I advise\nyou both,” she said, “to leave off out of respect for cousin Pao-yü, and\nhave done.”",
        "“I don’t agree to that,” Tai-yü rejoined; “are you people, pray, all of\none mind to do nothing but make fun of me?”",
        "“Who ventures to make fun of you?” Pao-yü observed advisingly; “and\nhadn’t you made sport of her, would she have presumed to have said\nanything about you?”",
        "While this quartet were finding it an arduous task to understand one\nanother, a servant came to invite them to have their repast, and they\neventually crossed over to the front side, and as it was already time\nfor the lamps to be lit, madame Wang, widow Li Wan, lady Feng, Ying\nCh’un, T’an Ch’un, Hsi Ch’un and the other cousins, adjourned in a body\nto dowager lady Chia’s apartments on this side, where the whole company\nspent a while in a chat on irrelevant topics, after which they each\nreturned to their rooms and retired to bed. Hsiang-yün, as of old,\nbetook herself to Tai-yü’s quarters to rest, and Pao-yü escorted them\nboth into their apartment, and it was after the hour had already past\nthe second watch, and Hsi Jen had come and pressed him several times,\nthat he at length returned to his own bedroom and went to sleep. The\nnext morning, as soon as it was daylight, he threw his clothes over him,\nput on his low shoes and came over into Tai-yü’s room, where he however\nsaw nothing of the two girls Tzu Chüan and Ts’ui Lu, as there was no one\nelse here in there besides his two cousins, still reclining under the\ncoverlets. Tai-yü was closely wrapped in a quilt of almond-red silk, and\nlying quietly, with closed eyes fast asleep; while Shih Hsiang-yün, with\nher handful of shiny hair draggling along the edge of the pillow, was\ncovered only up to the chest, and outside the coverlet rested her curved\nsnow-white arm, with the gold bracelets, which she had on.",
        "At the sight of her, Pao-yü heaved a sigh. “Even when asleep,” he\nsoliloquised, “she can’t be quiet! but by and by, when the wind will\nhave blown on her, she’ll again shout that her shoulder is sore!” With\nthese words, he gently covered her, but Lin Tai-yü had already awoke out\nof her sleep, and becoming aware that there was some one about, she\npromptly concluded that it must, for a certainty, be Pao-yü, and turning\nherself accordingly round, and discovering at a glance that the truth\nwas not beyond her conjectures, she observed: “What have you run over to\ndo at this early hour?” to which question Pao-yü replied: “Do you call\nthis early? but get up and see for yourself!”",
        "“First quit the room,” Tai-yü suggested, “and let us get up!”",
        "Pao-yü thereupon made his exit into the ante-chamber, and Tai-yü jumped\nout of bed, and awoke Hsiang-yün. When both of them had put on their\nclothes, Pao-yü re-entered and took a seat by the side of the toilet\ntable; whence he beheld Tzu-chüan and Hsüeh Yen walk in and wait upon\nthem, as they dressed their hair and performed their ablutions.\nHsiang-yün had done washing her face, and Ts’üi Lü at once took the\nremaining water and was about to throw it away, when Pao-yü interposed,\nsaying: “Wait, I’ll avail myself of this opportunity to wash too and\nfinish with it, and thus save myself the trouble of having again to go\nover!” Speaking the while, he hastily came forward, and bending his\nwaist, he washed his face twice with two handfuls of water, and when Tzu\nChüan went over to give him the scented soap, Pao-yü added: “In this\nbasin, there’s a good deal of it, and there’s no need of rubbing any\nmore!” He then washed his face with two more handfuls, and forthwith\nasked for a towel, and Ts’üi Lü exclaimed: “What! have you still got\nthis failing? when will you turn a new leaf?” But Pao-yü paid not so\nmuch as any heed to her, and there and then called for some salt, with\nwhich he rubbed his teeth, and rinsed his mouth. When he had done, he\nperceived that Hsiang-yün had already finished combing her hair, and\nspeedily coming up to her, he put on a smile, and said: “My dear cousin,\ncomb my hair for me!”",
        "“This can’t be done!” Hsiang-yün objected.",
        "“My dear cousin,” Pao-yü continued smirkingly, “how is it that you\ncombed it for me in former times?”",
        "“I’ve forgotten now how to comb it!” Hsiang-yün replied.",
        "“I’m not, after all, going out of doors,” Pao-yü observed, “nor will I\nwear a hat or frontlet, so that all that need be done is to plait a few\nqueues, that’s all!” Saying this, he went on to appeal to her in a\nthousand and one endearing terms, so that Hsiang-yün had no alternative,\nbut to draw his head nearer to her and to comb one queue after another,\nand as when he stayed at home he wore no hat, nor had, in fact, any\ntufted horns, she merely took the short surrounding hair from all four\nsides, and twisting it into small tufts, she collected it together over\nthe hair on the crown of the head, and plaited a large queue, binding it\nfast with red ribbon; while from the root of the hair to the end of the\nqueue, were four pearls in a row, below which, in the way of a tip, was\nsuspended a golden pendant.",
        "“Of these pearls there are only three,” Hsiang-yün remarked as she went\non plaiting; “this isn’t one like them; I remember these were all of one\nkind, and how is it that there’s one short?”",
        "“I’ve lost one,” Pao-yü rejoined.",
        "“It must have dropped,” Hsiang-yün added, “when you went out of doors,\nand been picked up by some one when you were off your guard; and he’s\nnow, instead of you, the richer for it.”",
        "“One can neither tell whether it has been really lost,” Tai-yü, who\nstood by, interposed, smiling the while sarcastically; “nor could one\nsay whether it hasn’t been given away to some one to be mounted in some\ntrinket or other and worn!”",
        "Pao-yü made no reply; but set to work, seeing that the two sides of the\ndressing table were all full of toilet boxes and other such articles,\ntaking up those that came under his hand and examining them. Grasping\nunawares a box of cosmetic, which was within his reach, he would have\nliked to have brought it to his lips, but he feared again lest\nHsiang-yün should chide him. While he was hesitating whether to do so or\nnot, Hsiang-yün, from behind, stretched forth her arm and gave him a\nsmack, which sent the cosmetic flying from his hand, as she cried out:\n\"You good-for-nothing! when will you mend those weaknesses of yours!\"\nBut hardly had she had time to complete this remark, when she caught\nsight of Hsi Jen walk in, who upon perceiving this state of things,\nbecame aware that he was already combed and washed, and she felt\nconstrained to go back and attend to her own coiffure and ablutions. But\nsuddenly, she saw Pao-ch’ai come in and inquire: “Where’s cousin Pao-yü\ngone?”",
        "“Do you mean to say,” Hsi Jen insinuated with a sardonic smile, “that\nyour cousin Pao-yü has leisure to stay at home?”",
        "When Pao-ch’ai heard these words, she inwardly comprehended her meaning,\nand when she further heard Hsi Jen remark with a sigh: “Cousins may well\nbe on intimate terms, but they should also observe some sort of\npropriety; and they shouldn’t night and day romp together; and no matter\nhow people may tender advice it’s all like so much wind blowing past the\nears.” Pao-ch’ai began, at these remarks, to cogitate within her mind:\n\"May I not, possibly, have been mistaken in my estimation of this girl;\nfor to listen to her words, she would really seem to have a certain\namount of savoir faire!”",
        "Pao-ch’ai thereupon took a seat on the stove-couch, and quietly, in the\ncourse of their conversation on one thing and another, she managed to\nascertain her age, her native village and other such particulars, and\nthen setting her mind diligently to put, on the sly, her conversation\nand mental capacity to the test, she discovered how deeply worthy she\nwas to be respected and loved. But in a while Pao-yü arrived, and\nPao-ch’ai at once quitted the apartment.",
        "“How is it,” Pao-yü at once inquired, “that cousin Pao-ch’ai was\nchatting along with you so lustily, and that as soon as she saw me\nenter, she promptly ran away?”",
        "Hsi Jen did not make any reply to his first question, and it was only\nwhen he had repeated it that Hsi Jen remarked: “Do you ask me? How can I\nknow what goes on between you two?”",
        "When Pao-yü heard these words, and he noticed that the look on her face\nwas so unlike that of former days, he lost no time in putting on a smile\nand asking: “Why is it that you too are angry in real earnest?”",
        "“How could I presume to get angry!” Hsi Jen rejoined smiling\nindifferently; “but you mustn’t, from this day forth, put your foot into\nthis room! and as you have anyhow people to wait on you, you shouldn’t\ncome again to make use of my services, for I mean to go and attend to\nour old mistress, as in days of old.”",
        "With this remark still on her lips, she lay herself down on the\nstove-couch and closed her eyes. When Pao-yü perceived the state of mind\nshe was in, he felt deeply surprised and could not refrain from coming\nforward and trying to cheer her up. But Hsi Jen kept her eyes closed and\npaid no heed to him, so that Pao-yü was quite at a loss how to act. But\nespying She Yüeh enter the room, he said with alacrity: “What’s up with\nyour sister?”",
        "“Do I know?” answered She Yüeh, “examine your own self and you’ll\nreadily know!”",
        "After these words had been heard by Pao-yü, he gazed vacantly for some\ntime, feeling the while very unhappy; but raising himself impetuously:\n\"Well!” he exclaimed, “if you don’t notice me, all right, I too will go\nto sleep,” and as he spoke he got up, and, descending from the couch, he\nbetook himself to his own bed and went to sleep. Hsi Jen noticing that\nhe had not budged for ever so long, and that he faintly snored, presumed\nthat he must have fallen fast asleep, so she speedily rose to her feet,\nand, taking a wrapper, came over and covered him. But a sound of “hu\"\nreached her ear, as Pao-yü promptly threw it off and once again closed\nhis eyes and feigned sleep. Hsi Jen distinctly grasped his idea and,\nforthwith nodding her head, she smiled coldly. “You really needn’t lose\nyour temper! but from this time forth, I’ll become mute, and not say one\nword to you; and what if I do?”",
        "Pao-yü could not restrain himself from rising. “What have I been up to\nagain,” he asked, “that you’re once more at me with your advice? As far\nas your advice goes, it’s all well and good; but just now without one\nword of counsel, you paid no heed to me when I came in, but, flying into\na huff, you went to sleep. Nor could I make out what it was all about,\nand now here you are again maintaining that I’m angry. But when did I\nhear you, pray, give me a word of advice of any kind?”",
        "“Doesn’t your mind yet see for itself?” Hsi Jen replied; “and do you\nstill expect me to tell you?”",
        "While they were disputing, dowager lady Chia sent a servant to call him\nto his repast, and he thereupon crossed over to the front; but after he\nhad hurriedly swallowed a few bowls of rice, he returned to his own\napartment, where he discovered Hsi Jen reclining on the outer\nstove-couch, while She Yüeh was playing with the dominoes by her side.\nPao-yü had been ever aware of the intimacy which existed between She\nYüeh and Hsi Jen, so that paying not the slightest notice to even She\nYüeh, he raised the soft portiere and straightway walked all alone into\nthe inner apartment. She Yüeh felt constrained to follow him in, but\nPao-yü at once pushed her out, saying: “I don’t venture to disturb you\ntwo;” so that She Yüeh had no alternative but to leave the room with a\nsmiling countenance, and to bid two young waiting-maids go in. Pao-yü\ntook hold of a book and read for a considerable time in a reclining\nposition; but upon raising his head to ask for some tea, he caught sight\nof a couple of waiting-maids, standing below; the one of whom, slightly\nolder than the other, was exceedingly winsome.",
        "“What’s your name?” Pao-yü eagerly inquired.",
        "“I’m called Hui Hsiang, (orchid fragrance),” that waiting-maid rejoined\nsimperingly.",
        "“Who gave you this name?” Pao-yü went on to ask.",
        "“I went originally under the name of Yün Hsiang (Gum Sandarac),” added\nHui Hsiang, “but Miss Hua it was who changed it.”",
        "“You should really be called Hui Ch’i, (latent fragrance), that would be\nproper; and why such stuff as Hui Hsiang, (orchid fragrance)?”",
        "“How many sisters have you got?” he further went on to ask of her.",
        "“Four,” replied Hui Hsiang.",
        "“Which of them are you?” Pao-yü asked.",
        "“The fourth,” answered Hui Hsiang.",
        "“By and by you must be called Ssu Erh, (fourth child),” Pao-yü\nsuggested, “for there’s no need for any such nonsense as Hui Hsiang\n(orchid fragrance) or Lan Ch’i (epidendrum perfume.) Which single girl\ndeserves to be compared to all these flowers, without profaning pretty\nnames and fine surnames!”",
        "As he uttered these words, he bade her give him some tea, which he\ndrank; while Hsi Jen and She Yüeh, who were in the outer apartment, had\nbeen listening for a long time and laughing with compressed lips.",
        "Pao-yü did not, on this day, so much as put his foot outside the door of\nhis room, but sat all alone sad and dejected, simply taking up his\nbooks, in order to dispel his melancholy fit, or diverting himself with\nhis writing materials; while he did not even avail himself of the\nservices of any of the family servants, but simply bade Ssu Erh answer\nhis calls.",
        "This Ssu Erh was, who would have thought it, a girl gifted with\nmatchless artfulness, and perceiving that Pao-yü had requisitioned her\nservices, she speedily began to devise extreme ways and means to\ninveigle him. When evening came, and dinner was over, Pao-yü’s eyes were\nscorching hot and his ears burning from the effects of two cups of wine\nthat he had taken. Had it been in past days, he would have now had Hsi\nJen and her companions with him, and with all their good cheer and\nlaughter, he would have been enjoying himself. But here was he, on this\noccasion, dull and forlorn, a solitary being, gazing at the lamp with an\nabsolute lack of pleasure. By and by he felt a certain wish to go after\nthem, but dreading that if they carried their point, they would, in the\nfuture, come and tender advice still more immoderate, and that, were he\nto put on the airs of a superior to intimidate them, he would appear to\nbe too deeply devoid of all feeling, he therefore, needless to say,\nthwarted the wish of his heart, and treated them just as if they were\ndead. And as anyway he was constrained also to live, alone though he\nwas, he readily looked upon them, for the time being as departed, and\ndid not worry his mind in the least on their account. On the contrary,\nhe was able to feel happy and contented with his own society. Hence it\nwas that bidding Ssu Erh trim the candles and brew the tea, he himself\nperused for a time the “Nan Hua Ching,” and upon reaching the precept:\n\"On thieves,” given on some additional pages, the burden of which was:\n\"Therefore by exterminating intuitive wisdom, and by discarding\nknowledge, highway robbers will cease to exist, and by taking off the\njade and by putting away the pearls, pilferers will not spring to\nexistence; by burning the slips and by breaking up the seals, by\nsmashing the measures, and snapping the scales, the result will be that\nthe people will not wrangle; by abrogating, to the utmost degree, wise\nrules under the heavens, the people will, at length, be able to take\r\npart in deliberation. By putting to confusion the musical scale, and\ndestroying fifes and lutes, by deafening the ears of the blind Kuang,\nthen, at last, will the human race in the world constrain his sense of\nhearing. By extinguishing literary compositions, by dispersing the five\ncolours and by sticking the eyes of Li Chu, then, at length, mankind\nunder the whole sky, will restrain the perception of his eyes. By\ndestroying and eliminating the hooks and lines, by discarding the\ncompasses and squares, and by amputating Kung Chui’s fingers, the human\nrace will ultimately succeed in constraining his ingenuity,\"–his high\nspirits, on perusal of this passage, were so exultant that taking\nadvantage of the exuberance caused by the wine, he picked up his pen,\nfor he could not repress himself, and continued the text in this wise:\n\"By burning the flower, (Hua-Hsi Jen) and dispersing the musk, (She\nYüeh), the consequence will be that the inmates of the inner chambers\nwill, eventually, keep advice to themselves. By obliterating Pao-ch’ai’s\nsupernatural beauty, by reducing to ashes Tai-yü’s spiritual perception,\nand by destroying and extinguishing my affectionate preferences, the\nbeautiful in the inner chambers as well as the plain will then, at\nlength, be put on the same footing. And as they will keep advice to\nthemselves, there will be no fear of any disagreement. By obliterating\nher supernatural beauty, I shall then have no incentive for any violent\naffection; by dissolving her spiritual perception, I will have no\nfeelings with which to foster the memory of her talents. The hair-pin,\njade, flower and musk (Pao-ch’ai, Tai-yü, Hsi Jen and She Yüeh) do each\nand all spread out their snares and dig mines, and thus succeed in\ninveigling and entrapping every one in the world.”",
        "At the conclusion of this annex, he flung the pen away, and lay himself\ndown to sleep. His head had barely reached the pillow before he at once\nfell fast asleep, remaining the whole night long perfectly unconscious\nof everything straight up to the break of day, when upon waking and\nturning himself round, he, at a glance, caught sight of no one else than\nHsi Jen, sleeping in her clothes over the coverlet.",
        "Pao-yü had already banished from his mind every thought of what had\ntranspired the previous day, so that forthwith giving Hsi Jen a push:\n\"Get up!” he said, “and be careful where you sleep, as you may catch\ncold.”",
        "The fact is that Hsi Jen was aware that he was, without regard to day or\nnight, ever up to mischief with his female cousins; but presuming that\nif she earnestly called him to account, he would not mend his ways, she\nhad, for this reason, had recourse to tender language to exhort him, in\nthe hope that, in a short while, he would come round again to his better\nself. But against all her expectations Pao-yü had, after the lapse of a\nwhole day and night, not changed the least in his manner, and as she\nreally was in her heart quite at a loss what to do, she failed to find\nthroughout the whole night any proper sleep. But when on this day, she\nunexpectedly perceived Pao-yü in this mood, she flattered herself that\nhe had made up his mind to effect a change, and readily thought it best\nnot to notice him. Pao-yü, seeing that she made no reply, forthwith\nstretched out his hand and undid her jacket; but he had just unclasped\nthe button, when his arm was pushed away by Hsi Jen, who again made it\nfast herself.",
        "Pao-yü was so much at his wit’s ends that he had no alternative but to\ntake her hand and smilingly ask: “What’s the matter with you, after all,\nthat I’ve had to ask you something time after time?”",
        "Hsi Jen opened her eyes wide. “There’s nothing really the matter with\nme!” she observed; “but as you’re awake, you surely had better be going\nover into the opposite room to comb your hair and wash; for if you\ndilly-dally any longer, you won’t be in time.”",
        "“Where shall I go over to?” Pao-yü inquired.",
        "Hsi Jen gave a sarcastic grin. “Do you ask me?” she rejoined; “do I\nknow? you’re at perfect liberty to go over wherever you like; from this\nday forth you and I must part company so as to avoid fighting like cocks\nor brawling like geese, to the amusement of third parties. Indeed, when\nyou get surfeited on that side, you come over to this, where there are,\nafter all, such girls as Fours and Fives (Ssu Erh and Wu Erh) to dance\nattendance upon you. But such kind of things as ourselves uselessly\ndefile fine names and fine surnames.”",
        "“Do you still remember this to-day!” Pao-yü asked with a smirk.",
        "“Hundred years hence I shall still bear it in mind,” Hsi Jen protested;\n\"I’m not like you, who treat my words as so much wind blowing by the\nside of your ears, that what I’ve said at night, you’ve forgotten early\nin the morning.”",
        "Pao-yü perceiving what a seductive though angry air pervaded her face\nfound it difficult to repress his feelings, and speedily taking up, from\nthe side of the pillow, a hair-pin made of jade, he dashed it down\nbreaking it into two exclaiming: “If I again don’t listen to your words,\nmay I fare like this hair-pin.”",
        "Hsi Jen immediately picked up the hair-pin, as she remarked: “What’s up\nwith you at this early hour of the morning? Whether you listen or not is\nof no consequence; and is it worth while that you should behave as you\ndo?”",
        "“How can you know,” Pao-yü answered, “the anguish in my heart!”",
        "“Do you also know what anguish means?” Hsi Jen observed laughing; “if\nyou do, then you can judge what the state of my heart is! But be quick\nand get up, and wash your face and be off!”",
        "As she spoke, they both got out of bed and performed their toilette; but\nafter Pao-yü had gone to the drawing rooms, and at a moment least\nexpected by any one, Tai-yü walked into his apartment. Noticing that\nPao-yü was not in, she was fumbling with the books on the table and\nexamining them, when, as luck would have it, she turned up the Chuang\nTzu of the previous day. Upon perusing the passage tagged on by Pao-yü,\nshe could not help feeling both incensed and amused. Nor could she\nrestrain herself from taking up the pen and appending a stanza to this\neffect:",
        "  Who is that man, who of his pen, without good rhyme, made use,\n  A toilsome task to do into the Chuang-tzu text to steal,\n  Who for the knowledge he doth lack no sense of shame doth feel,\n  But language vile and foul employs third parties to abuse?",
        "At the conclusion of what she had to write, she too came into the\ndrawing room; but after paying her respects to dowager lady Chia, she\nwalked over to madame Wang’s quarters.",
        "Contrary to everybody’s expectations, lady Feng’s daughter, Ta Chieh\nErh, had fallen ill, and a great fuss was just going on as the doctor\nhad been sent for to diagnose her ailment.",
        "“My congratulations to you, ladies,” the doctor explained; “this young\nlady has fever, as she has small-pox; indeed it’s no other complaint!”",
        "As soon as madame Wang and lady Feng heard the tidings, they lost no\ntime in sending round to ascertain whether she was getting on all right\nor not, and the doctor replied: “The symptoms are, it is true, serious,\nbut favourable; but though after all importing no danger, it’s necessary\nto get ready the silkworms and pigs’ tails.”",
        "When lady Feng received this report, she, there and then, hastened to\nmake the necessary preparations, and while she had the rooms swept and\noblations offered to the goddess of small-pox, she, at the same time,\ntransmitted orders to her household to avoid viands fried or roasted in\nfat, or other such heating things; and also bade P’ing Erh get ready the\nbedding and clothes for Chia Lien in a separate room, and taking pieces\nof deep red cotton material, she distributed them to the nurses,\nwaiting-maids and all the servants, who were in close attendance, to cut\nout clothes for themselves. And having had likewise some apartments\noutside swept clean, she detained two doctors to alternately deliberate\non the treatment, feel the pulse and administer the medicines; and for\ntwelve days, they were not at liberty to return to their homes; while\nChia Lien had no help but to move his quarters temporarily into the\nouter library, and lady Feng and P’ing Erh remained both in daily\nattendance upon madame Wang in her devotions to the goddess.",
        "Chia Lien, now that he was separated from lady Feng, soon felt disposed\nto look round for a flame. He had only slept alone for a couple of\nnights, but these nights had been so intensely intolerable that he had\nno option than to choose, for the time being, from among the young\npages, those who were of handsome appearance, and bring them over to\nrelieve his monotony. In the Jung Kuo mansion, there was, it happened, a\ncook, a most useless, good-for-nothing drunkard, whose name was To Kuan,\nin whom people recognised an infirm and a useless husband so that they\nall dubbed him with the name of To Hun Ch’ung, the stupid worm To. As\nthe wife given to him in marriage by his father and mother was this year\njust twenty, and possessed further several traits of beauty, and was\nalso naturally of a flighty and frivolous disposition, she had an\nextreme penchant for violent flirtations. But To Hun-ch’ung, on the\nother hand, did not concern himself (with her deportment), and as long\nas he had wine, meat and money he paid no heed whatever to anything. And\nfor this reason it was that all the men in the two mansions of Ning and\nJung had been successful in their attentions; and as this woman was\nexceptionally fascinating and incomparably giddy, she was generally\nknown by all by the name To Ku Ning (Miss To).",
        "Chia Lien, now that he had his quarters outside, chafed under the pangs\nof irksome ennui, yet he too, in days gone by, had set his eyes upon\nthis woman, and had for long, watered in the mouth with admiration; but\nas, inside, he feared his winsome wife, and outside, he dreaded his\nbeloved lads, he had not made any advances. But this To Ku Niang had\nlikewise a liking for Chia Lien, and was full of resentment at the\nabsence of a favourable opportunity; but she had recently come to hear\nthat Chia Lien had shifted his quarters into the outer library, and her\nwont was, even in the absence of any legitimate purpose, to go over\nthree and four times to entice him on; but though Chia Lien was, in\nevery respect, like a rat smitten with hunger, he could not dispense\nwith holding consultation with the young friends who enjoyed his\nconfidence; and as he struck a bargain with them for a large amount of\nmoney and silks, how could they ever not have come to terms (with him to\nspeak on his behalf)? Besides, they were all old friends of this woman,\nso that, as soon as they conveyed the proposal, she willingly accepted\nit. When night came To Hun Ch’ung was lying on the couch in a state of\ndrunkenness, and at the second watch, when every one was quiet, Chia\nLien at once slipped in, and they had their assignation. As soon as he\ngazed upon her face, he lost control over his senses, and without even\none word of ordinary greeting or commonplace remark, they forthwith,\nfervently indulged in a most endearing tête-à-tête.",
        "This woman possessed, who could have thought it, a strange natural\ncharm; for, as soon as any one of her lovers came within any close\ndistance of her, he speedily could not but notice that her very tendons\nand bones mollified, paralysed-like from feeling, so that his was the\nsensation of basking in a soft bower of love. What is more, her\ndemonstrative ways and free-and-easy talk put even those of a born\ncoquette to shame, with the result that while Chia Lien, at this time,\nlonged to become heart and soul one with her, the woman designedly\nindulged in immodest innuendoes.",
        "“Your daughter is at home,” she insinuated in her recumbent position,\n\"ill with the small-pox, and prayers are being offered to the goddess;\nand your duty too should be to abstain from love affairs for a couple of\ndays, but on the contrary, by flirting with me, you’ve contaminated\nyourself! but, you’d better be off at once from me here!”",
        "“You’re my goddess!” gaspingly protested Chia Lien, as he gave way to\ndemonstrativeness; “what do I care about any other goddess!”",
        "The woman began to be still more indelicate in her manner, so that Chia\nLien could not refrain himself from making a full exhibition of his warm\nsentiments. When their tête-à-tête had come to a close, they both went\non again to vow by the mountains and swear by the seas, and though they\nfound it difficult to part company and hard to tear themselves away,\nthey, in due course, became, after this occasion, mutual sworn friends.\nBut by a certain day the virus in Ta Chieh’s system had become\nexhausted, and the spots subsided, and at the expiry of twelve days the\ngoddess was removed, and the whole household offered sacrifices to\nheaven, worshipped the ancestors, paid their vows, burnt incense,\nexchanged congratulations, and distributed presents. And these\nformalities observed, Chia Lien once more moved back into his own\nbedroom and was reunited with lady Feng. The proverb is indeed true\nwhich says: “That a new marriage is not equal to a long separation,” for\nthere ensued between them demonstrations of loving affection still more\nnumerous than heretofore, to which we need not, of course, refer with\nany minuteness.",
        "The next day, at an early hour, after lady Feng had gone into the upper\nrooms, P’ing Erh set to work to put in order the clothes and bedding,\nwhich had been brought from outside, when, contrary to her expectation,\na tress of hair fell out from inside the pillow-case, as she was intent\nupon shaking it. P’ing Erh understood its import, and taking at once the\nhair, she concealed it in her sleeve, and there and then came over into\nthe room on this side, where she produced the hair, and smirkingly asked\nChia Lien, “What’s this?”",
        "Chia Lien, at the sight of it, lost no time in making a snatch with the\nidea of depriving her of it; and when P’ing Erh speedily endeavoured to\nrun away, she was clutched by Chia Lien, who put her down on the\nstove-couch, and came up to take it from her hand.",
        "“You heartless fellow!” P’ing Erh laughingly exclaimed, “I conceal this,\nwith every good purpose, from her knowledge, and come to ask you about\nit, and you, on the contrary, fly into a rage! But wait till she comes\nback, and I’ll tell her, and we’ll see what will happen.”",
        "At these words, Chia Lien hastily forced a smile. “Dear girl!” he\nentreated, “give it to me, and I won’t venture again to fly into a\npassion.”",
        "But hardly was this remark finished, when they heard the voice of lady\nFeng penetrate into the room. As soon as it reached the ear of Chia\nLien, he was at a loss whether it was better to let her go or to snatch\nit away, and kept on shouting, “My dear girl! don’t let her know.”",
        "P’ing Erh at once rose to her feet; but lady Feng had already entered\nthe room; and she went on to bid P’ing Erh be quick and open a box and\nfind a pattern for madame Wang. P’ing Erh expressed her obedience with\nalacrity; but while in search of it, lady Feng caught sight of Chia\nLien; and suddenly remembering something, she hastened to ask P’ing Erh\nabout it.",
        "“The other day,” she observed, “some things were taken out, and have you\nbrought them all in or not?”",
        "“I have!” P’ing Erh assented.",
        "“Is there anything short or not?” lady Feng inquired.",
        "“I’ve carefully looked at them,” P’ing Erh added, “and haven’t found\neven one single thing short.”",
        "“Is there anything in excess?” lady Feng went on to ascertain.",
        "P’ing Erh laughed. “It’s enough,” she rejoined, “that there’s nothing\nshort; and how could there really turn out to be anything over and\nabove?”",
        "“That this half month,” lady Feng continued still smiling, “things have\ngone on immaculately it would be hard to vouch; for some intimate friend\nthere may have been, who possibly has left something behind, in the\nshape of a ring, handkerchief or other such object, there’s no saying\nfor certain!”",
        "While these words were being spoken, Chia Lien’s face turned perfectly\nsallow, and, as he stood behind lady Feng, he was intent upon gazing at\nP’ing Erh, making signs to her (that he was going) to cut her throat as\na chicken is killed, (threatening her not to utter a sound) and\nentreating her to screen him; but P’ing Erh pretended not to notice him,\nand consequently observed smiling: “How is it that my ideas should\ncoincide with those of yours, my lady; and as I suspected that there may\nhave been something of the kind, I carefully searched all over, but I\ndidn’t find even so much as the slightest thing wrong; and if you don’t\nbelieve me, my lady, you can search for your own self.”",
        "“You fool!” lady Feng laughed, “had he any things of the sort, would he\nbe likely to let you and I discover them!”",
        "With these words still on her lips, she took the patterns and went her\nway; whereupon P’ing Erh pointed at her nose, and shook her head to and\nfro. “In this matter,” she smiled, “how much you should be grateful to\nme!” A remark which so delighted Chia Lien that his eyebrows distended,\nand his eyes smiled, and running over, he clasped her in his embrace,\nand called her promiscuously: “My darling, my pet, my own treasure!”",
        "“This,” observed P’ing Erh, with the tress in her hand, “will be my\nsource of power, during all my lifetime! if you treat me kindly, then\nwell and good! but if you behave unkindly, then we’ll at once produce\nthis thing!”",
        "“Do put it away, please,” Chia Lien entreated smirkingly, “and don’t, on\nan any account, let her know about it!” and as he uttered these words,\nhe noticed that she was off her guard, and, with a snatch, readily\ngrabbed it adding laughingly: “In your hands, it would be a source of\nwoe, so that it’s better that I should burn it, and have done with it!\"\nSaying this he simultaneously shoved it down the sides of his boot,\nwhile P’ing Erh shouted as she set her teeth close: “You wicked man! you\ncross the river and then demolish the bridge! but do you imagine that\nI’ll by and by again tell lies on your behalf!”",
        "Chia Lien perceiving how heart-stirring her seductive charms were,\nforthwith clasped her in his arms, and begged her to be his; but P’ing\nErh snatched her hands out of his grasp and ran away out of the room;\nwhich so exasperated Chia Lien that as he bent his body, he exclaimed,\nfull of indignation: “What a dreadful niggardly young wench! she\nactually sets her mind to stir up people’s affections with her wanton\nblandishments, and then, after all, she runs away!”",
        "“If I be wanton, it’s my own look-out;” P’ing Erh answered, from outside\nthe window, with a grin, “and who told you to arouse your affections? Do\nyou forsooth mean to imply that my wish is to become your tool? And did\nshe come to know about it would she again ever forgive me?”",
        "“You needn’t dread her!” Chia Lien urged; “wait till my monkey is up,\nand I’ll take this jealous woman, and beat her to atoms; and she’ll then\nknow what stuff I’m made of. She watches me just as she would watch a\nthief! and she’s only to hobnob with men, and I’m not to say a word to\nany girl! and if I do say aught to a girl, or get anywhere near one, she\nmust at once give way to suspicion. But with no regard to younger\nbrothers or nephews, to young and old, she prattles and giggles with\nthem, and doesn’t entertain any fear that I may be jealous; but\nhenceforward I too won’t allow her to set eyes upon any man.”",
        "“If she be jealous, there’s every reason,” P’ing Erh answered, “but for\nyou to be jealous on her account isn’t right. Her conduct is really\nstraightforward, and her deportment upright, but your conduct is\nactuated by an evil heart, so much so that even I don’t feel my heart at\nease, not to say anything of her.”",
        "“You two,” continued Chia Lien, “have a mouth full of malicious breath!\nEverything the couple of you do is invariably proper, while whatever I\ndo is all from an evil heart! But some time or other I shall bring you\nboth to your end with my own hands!”",
        "This sentence was scarcely at an end, when lady Feng walked into the\ncourt. “If you’re bent upon chatting,” she urgently inquired, upon\nseeing P’ing Erh outside the window, “why don’t you go into the room?\nand what do you mean, instead, by running out, and speaking with the\nwindow between?”",
        "Chia Lien from inside took up the string of the conversation. “You\nshould ask her,” he said. “It would verily seem as if there were a tiger\nin the room to eat her up.”",
        "“There’s not a single person in the room,” P’ing Erh rejoined, “and what\nshall I stay and do with him?”",
        "“It’s just the proper thing that there should be no one else! Isn’t it?\"\nlady Feng remarked grinning sarcastically.",
        "“Do these words allude to me?” P’ing Erh hastily asked, as soon as she\nhad heard what she said.",
        "Lady Feng forthwith laughed. “If they don’t allude to you,” she\ncontinued, “to whom do they?”",
        "“Don’t press me to come out with some nice things!” P’ing Erh\ninsinuated, and, as she spoke, she did not even raise the portiere (for\nlady Feng to enter), but straightway betook herself to the opposite\nside.",
        "Lady Feng lifted the portiere with her own hands, and walked into the\nroom. “That girl P’ing Erh,” she exclaimed, “has gone mad, and if this\nhussey does in real earnest wish to try and get the upper hand of me, it\nwould be well for you to mind your skin.”",
        "Chia Lien listened to her, as he kept reclining on the couch. “I never\nin the least knew,” he ventured, clapping his hands and laughing, “that\nP’ing Erh was so dreadful; and I must, after all, from henceforth look\nup to her with respect!”",
        "“It’s all through your humouring her,” lady Feng rejoined; “so I’ll\nsimply settle scores with you and finish with it.”",
        "“Ts’ui!” ejaculated Chia Lien at these words, “because you two can’t\nagree, must you again make a scapegoat of me! Well then, I’ll get out of\nthe way of both of you!”",
        "“I’ll see where you’ll go and hide,” lady Feng observed.",
        "“I’ve got somewhere to go!” Chia Lien added; and with these words, he\nwas about to go, when lady Feng urged: “Don’t be off! I have something\nto tell you.”",
        "What it is, is not yet known, but, reader, listen to the account given\nin the next chapter.",
        "  Upon hearing the text of the stanza, Pao-yü comprehends the Buddhistic\n      spells.\n  While the enigmas for the lanterns are being devised, Chia Cheng is\n      grieved by a prognostic.",
        "Chia Lien, for we must now prosecute our story, upon hearing lady Feng\nobserve that she had something to consult about with him, felt\nconstrained to halt and to inquire what it was about.",
        "“On the 21st,” lady Feng explained, “is cousin Hsüeh’s birthday, and\nwhat do you, after all, purpose doing?”",
        "“Do I know what to do?” exclaimed Chia Lien; “you have made, time and\nagain, arrangements for ever so many birthdays of grown-up people, and\ndo you, really, find yourself on this occasion without any resources?”",
        "“Birthdays of grown-up people are subject to prescribed rules,” lady\nFeng expostulated; “but her present birthday is neither one of an adult\nnor that of an infant, and that’s why I would like to deliberate with\nyou!”",
        "Chia Lien upon hearing this remark, lowered his head and gave himself to\nprotracted reflection. “You’re indeed grown dull!” he cried; “why you’ve\na precedent ready at hand to suit your case! Cousin Lin’s birthday\naffords a precedent, and what you did in former years for cousin Lin,\nyou can in this instance likewise do for cousin Hsüeh, and it will be\nall right.”",
        "At these words lady Feng gave a sarcastic smile. “Do you, pray, mean to\ninsinuate,” she added, “that I’m not aware of even this! I too had\npreviously come, after some thought, to this conclusion; but old lady\nChia explained, in my hearing yesterday, that having made inquiries\nabout all their ages and their birthdays, she learnt that cousin Hsüeh\nwould this year be fifteen, and that though this was not the birthday,\nwhich made her of age, she could anyhow well be regarded as being on the\ndawn of the year, in which she would gather up her hair, so that our\ndowager lady enjoined that her anniversary should, as a matter of\ncourse, be celebrated, unlike that of cousin Lin.”",
        "“Well, in that case,” Chia Lien suggested, “you had better make a few\nadditions to what was done for cousin Lin!”",
        "“That’s what I too am thinking of,” lady Feng replied, “and that’s why\nI’m asking your views; for were I, on my own hook, to add anything you\nwould again feel hurt for my not have explained things to you.”",
        "“That will do, that will do!” Chia Lien rejoined laughing, “none of\nthese sham attentions for me! So long as you don’t pry into my doings it\nwill be enough; and will I go so far as to bear you a grudge?”",
        "With these words still in his mouth, he forthwith went off. But leaving\nhim alone we shall now return to Shih Hsiang-yün. After a stay of a\ncouple of days, her intention was to go back, but dowager lady Chia\nsaid: “Wait until after you have seen the theatrical performance, when\nyou can return home.”",
        "At this proposal, Shih Hsiang-yün felt constrained to remain, but she,\nat the same time, despatched a servant to her home to fetch two pieces\nof needlework, which she had in former days worked with her own hands,\nfor a birthday present for Pao-ch’ai.",
        "Contrary to all expectations old lady Chia had, since the arrival of\nPao-ch’ai, taken quite a fancy to her, for her sedateness and good\nnature, and as this happened to be the first birthday which she was\nabout to celebrate (in the family) she herself readily contributed\ntwenty taels which, after sending for lady Feng, she handed over to her,\nto make arrangements for a banquet and performance.",
        "“A venerable senior like yourself,” lady Feng thereupon smiled and\nventured, with a view to enhancing her good cheer, “is at liberty to\ncelebrate the birthday of a child in any way agreeable to you, without\nany one presuming to raise any objection; but what’s the use again of\ngiving a banquet? But since it be your good pleasure and your purpose to\nhave it celebrated with éclat, you could, needless to say, your own self\nhave spent several taels from the private funds in that old treasury of\nyours! But you now produce those twenty taels, spoiled by damp and\nmould, to play the hostess with, with the view indeed of compelling us\nto supply what’s wanted! But hadn’t you really been able to contribute\nany more, no one would have a word to say; but the gold and silver,\nround as well as flat, have with their heavy weight pressed down the\nbottom of the box! and your sole object is to harass us and to extort\nfrom us. But raise your eyes and look about you; who isn’t your\nvenerable ladyship’s son and daughter? and is it likely, pray, that in\nthe future there will only be cousin Pao-yü to carry you, our old lady,\non his head, up the Wu T’ai Shan? You may keep all these things for him\nalone! but though we mayn’t at present, deserve that anything should be\nspent upon us, you shouldn’t go so far as to place us in any\nperplexities (by compelling us to subscribe). And is this now enough for\nwines, and enough for the theatricals?”",
        "As she bandied these words, every one in the whole room burst out\nlaughing, and even dowager lady Chia broke out in laughter while she\nobserved: “Do you listen to that mouth? I myself am looked upon as\nhaving the gift of the gab, but why is it that I can’t talk in such a\nwise as to put down this monkey? Your mother-in-law herself doesn’t dare\nto be so overbearing in her speech; and here you are jabber, jabber with\nme!”",
        "“My mother-in-law,” explained lady Feng, “is also as fond of Pao-yü as\nyou are, so much so that I haven’t anywhere I could go and give vent to\nmy grievances; and instead of (showing me some regard) you say that I’m\noverbearing in my speech!”",
        "With these words, she again enticed dowager lady Chia to laugh for a\nwhile. The old lady continued in the highest of spirits, and, when\nevening came, and they all appeared in her presence to pay their\nobeisance, her ladyship made it a point, while the whole company of\nladies and young ladies were engaged in chatting, to ascertain of\nPao-ch’ai what play she liked to hear, and what things she fancied to\neat.",
        "Pao-ch’ai was well aware that dowager lady Chia, well up in years though\nshe was, delighted in sensational performances, and was partial to sweet\nand tender viands, so that she readily deferred, in every respect, to\nthose things, which were to the taste of her ladyship, and enumerated a\nwhole number of them, which made the old lady become the more exuberant.\nAnd the next day, she was the first to send over clothes, nicknacks and\nsuch presents, while madame Wang and lady Feng, Tai-yü and the other\ngirls, as well as the whole number of inmates had all presents for her,\nregulated by their degree of relationship, to which we need not allude\nin detail.",
        "When the 21st arrived, a stage of an ordinary kind, small but yet handy,\nwas improvised in dowager lady Chia’s inner court, and a troupe of young\nactors, who had newly made their début, was retained for the nonce,\namong whom were both those who could sing tunes, slow as well as fast.\nIn the drawing rooms of the old lady were then laid out several tables\nfor a family banquet and entertainment, at which there was not a single\noutside guest; and with the exception of Mrs. Hsüeh, Shih Hsiang-yün,\nand Pao-ch’ai, who were visitors, the rest were all inmates of her\nhousehold.",
        "On this day, Pao-yü failed, at any early hour, to see anything of Lin\nTai-yü, and coming at once to her rooms in search of her, he discovered\nher reclining on the stove-couch. “Get up,” Pao-yü pressed her with a\nsmile, “and come and have breakfast, for the plays will commence\nshortly; but whichever plays you would like to listen to, do tell me so\nthat I may be able to choose them.”",
        "Tai-yü smiled sarcastically. “In that case,” she rejoined, “you had\nbetter specially engage a troupe and select those I like sung for my\nbenefit; for on this occasion you can’t be so impertinent as to make use\nof their expense to ask me what I like!”",
        "“What’s there impossible about this?” Pao-yü answered smiling; “well,\nto-morrow I’ll readily do as you wish, and ask them too to make use of\nwhat is yours and mine.”",
        "As he passed this remark, he pulled her up, and taking her hand in his\nown, they walked out of the room and came and had breakfast. When the\ntime arrived to make a selection of the plays, dowager lady Chia of her\nown motion first asked Pao-ch’ai to mark off those she liked; and though\nfor a time Pao-ch’ai declined, yielding the choice to others, she had no\nalternative but to decide, fixing upon a play called, “the Record of the\nWestern Tour,” a play of which the old lady was herself very fond. Next\nin order, she bade lady Feng choose, and lady Feng, had, after all, in\nspite of madame Wang ranking before her in precedence, to consider old\nlady Chia’s request, and not to presume to show obstinacy by any\ndisobedience. But as she knew well enough that her ladyship had a\npenchant for what was exciting, and that she was still more partial to\njests, jokes, epigrams, and buffoonery, she therefore hastened to\nprecede (madame Wang) and to choose a play, which was in fact no other\nthan “Liu Erh pawns his clothes.”",
        "Dowager lady Chia was, of course, still more elated. And after this she\nspeedily went on to ask Tai-yü to choose. Tai-yü likewise concedingly\nyielded her turn in favour of madame Wang and the other seniors, to make\ntheir selections before her, but the old lady expostulated. “To-day,\"\nshe said, “is primarily an occasion, on which I’ve brought all of you\nhere for your special recreation; and we had better look after our own\nselves and not heed them! For have I, do you imagine, gone to the\ntrouble of having a performance and laying a feast for their special\nbenefit? they’re already reaping benefit enough by being in here,\nlistening to the plays and partaking of the banquet, when they have no\nright to either; and are they to be pressed further to make a choice of\nplays?”",
        "At these words, the whole company had a hearty laugh; after which,\nTai-yü, at length, marked off a play; next in order following Pao-yü,\nShih Hsiang-yün, Ying-ch’un, T’an Ch’un, Hsi Ch’un, widow Li Wan, and\nthe rest, each and all of whom made a choice of plays, which were sung\nin the costumes necessary for each. When the time came to take their\nplaces at the banquet, dowager lady Chia bade Pao-ch’ai make another\nselection, and Pao-ch’ai cast her choice upon the play: “Lu Chih-shen,\nin a fit of drunkenness stirs up a disturbance up the Wu T’ai mountain;\"\nwhereupon Pao-yü interposed, with the remark: “All you fancy is to\nchoose plays of this kind;” to which Pao-ch’ai rejoined, “You’ve\nlistened to plays all these years to no avail! How could you know the\nbeauties of this play? the stage effect is grand, but what is still\nbetter are the apt and elegant passages in it.”",
        "“I’ve always had a dread of such sensational plays as these!” Pao-yü\nretorted.",
        "“If you call this play sensational,” Pao-ch’ai smilingly expostulated,\n\"well then you may fitly be looked upon as being no connoisseur of\nplays. But come over and I’ll tell you. This play constitutes one of a\nset of books, entitled the ’Pei Tien Peng Ch’un,’ which, as far as\nharmony, musical rests and closes, and tune go, is, it goes without\nsaying, perfect; but there’s among the elegant compositions a ballad\nentitled: ’the Parasitic Plant,’ written in a most excellent style; but\nhow could you know anything about it?”",
        "Pao-yü, upon hearing her speak of such points of beauty, hastily drew\nnear to her. “My dear cousin,” he entreated, “recite it and let me hear\nit!” Whereupon Pao-ch’ai went on as follows:",
        "  My manly tears I will not wipe away,\n  But from this place, the scholar’s home, I’ll stray.\n  The bonze for mercy I shall thank; under the lotus altar shave my\n      pate;\n  With Yüan to be the luck I lack; soon in a twinkle we shall separate,\n  And needy and forlorn I’ll come and go, with none to care about my\n      fate.\n  Thither shall I a suppliant be for a fog wrapper and rain hat; my\n      warrant I shall roll,\n  And listless with straw shoes and broken bowl, wherever to convert my\n      fate may be, I’ll stroll.",
        "As soon as Pao-yü had listened to her recital, he was so full of\nenthusiasm, that, clapping his knees with his hands, and shaking his\nhead, he gave vent to incessant praise; after which he went on to extol\nPao-ch’ai, saying: “There’s no book that you don’t know.”",
        "“Be quiet, and listen to the play,” Lin Tai-yü urged; “they haven’t yet\nsung about the mountain gate, and you already pretend to be mad!”",
        "At these words, Hsiang-yün also laughed. But, in due course, the whole\nparty watched the performance until evening, when they broke up. Dowager\nlady Chia was so very much taken with the young actor, who played the\nrole of a lady, as well as with the one who acted the buffoon, that she\ngave orders that they should be brought in; and, as she looked at them\nclosely, she felt so much the more interest in them, that she went on to\ninquire what their ages were. And when the would-be lady (replied) that\nhe was just eleven, while the would-be buffoon (explained) that he was\njust nine, the whole company gave vent for a time to expressions of\nsympathy with their lot; while dowager lady Chia bade servants bring a\nfresh supply of meats and fruits for both of them, and also gave them,\nbesides their wages, two tiaos as a present.",
        "“This lad,” lady Feng observed smiling, “is when dressed up (as a girl),\na living likeness of a certain person; did you notice it just now?”",
        "Pao-ch’ai was also aware of the fact, but she simply nodded her head\nassentingly and did not say who it was. Pao-yü likewise expressed his\nassent by shaking his head, but he too did not presume to speak out.\nShih Hsiang-yün, however, readily took up the conversation. “He\nresembles,” she interposed, “cousin Lin’s face!” When this remark\nreached Pao-yü’s ear, he hastened to cast an angry scowl at Hsiang-yün,\nand to make her a sign; while the whole party, upon hearing what had\nbeen said, indulged in careful and minute scrutiny of (the lad); and as\nthey all began to laugh: “The resemblance is indeed striking!” they\nexclaimed.",
        "After a while, they parted; and when evening came Hsiang-yün directed\nTs’ui Lü to pack up her clothes.",
        "“What’s the hurry?” Ts’ui Lü asked. “There will be ample time to pack\nup, on the day on which we go!”",
        "“We’ll go to-morrow,” Hsiang-yün rejoined; “for what’s the use of\nremaining here any longer–to look at people’s mouths and faces?”",
        "Pao-yü, at these words, lost no time in pressing forward.",
        "“My dear cousin,” he urged; “you’re wrong in bearing me a grudge! My\ncousin Lin is a girl so very touchy, that though every one else\ndistinctly knew (of the resemblance), they wouldn’t speak out; and all\nbecause they were afraid that she would get angry; but unexpectedly out\nyou came with it, at a moment when off your guard; and how ever couldn’t\nshe but feel hurt? and it’s because I was in dread that you would give\noffence to people that I then winked at you; and now here you are angry\nwith me; but isn’t that being ungrateful to me? Had it been any one\nelse, would I have cared whether she had given offence to even ten; that\nwould have been none of my business!”",
        "Hsiang-yün waved her hand: “Don’t,” she added, “come and tell me these\nflowery words and this specious talk, for I really can’t come up to your\ncousin Lin. If others poke fun at her, they all do so with impunity,\nwhile if I say anything, I at once incur blame. The fact is I shouldn’t\nhave spoken of her, undeserving as I am; and as she’s the daughter of a\nmaster, while I’m a slave, a mere servant girl, I’ve heaped insult upon\nher!”",
        "“And yet,” pleaded Pao-yü, full of perplexity, “I had done it for your\nsake; and through this, I’ve come in for reproach. But if it were with\nan evil heart I did so, may I at once become ashes, and be trampled upon\nby ten thousands of people!”",
        "“In this felicitous firstmonth,” Hsiang-yün remonstrated, “you shouldn’t\ntalk so much reckless nonsense! All these worthless despicable oaths,\ndisjointed words, and corrupt language, go and tell for the benefit of\nthose mean sort of people, who in everything take pleasure in irritating\nothers, and who keep you under their thumb! But mind don’t drive me to\nspit contemptuously at you.”",
        "As she gave utterance to these words, she betook herself in the inner\nroom of dowager lady Chia’s suite of apartments, where she lay down in\nhigh dudgeon, and, as Pao-yü was so heavy at heart, he could not help\ncoming again in search of Tai-yü; but strange to say, as soon as he put\nhis foot inside the doorway, he was speedily hustled out of it by\nTai-yü, who shut the door in his face.",
        "Pao-yü was once more unable to fathom her motives, and as he stood\noutside the window, he kept on calling out: “My dear cousin,” in a low\ntone of voice; but Tai-yü paid not the slightest notice to him so that\nPao-yü became so melancholy that he drooped his head, and was plunged in\nsilence. And though Hsi Jen had, at an early hour, come to know the\ncircumstances, she could not very well at this juncture tender any\nadvice.",
        "Pao-yü remained standing in such a vacant mood that Tai-yü imagined that\nhe had gone back; but when she came to open the door she caught sight of\nPao-yü still waiting in there; and as Tai-yü did not feel justified to\nagain close the door, Pao-yü consequently followed her in.",
        "“Every thing has,” he observed, “a why and a wherefore; which, when\nspoken out, don’t even give people pain; but you will rush into a rage,\nand all without any rhyme! but to what really does it owe its rise?”",
        "“It’s well enough, after all, for you to ask me,” Tai-yü rejoined with\nan indifferent smile, “but I myself don’t know why! But am I here to\nafford you people amusement that you will compare me to an actress, and\nmake the whole lot have a laugh at me?”",
        "“I never did liken you to anything,” Pao-yü protested, “neither did I\never laugh at you! and why then will you get angry with me?”",
        "“Was it necessary that you should have done so much as made the\ncomparison,” Tai-yü urged, “and was there any need of even any laughter\nfrom you? why, though you mayn’t have likened me to anything, or had a\nlaugh at my expense, you were, yea more dreadful than those who did\ncompare me (to a singing girl) and ridiculed me!”",
        "Pao-yü could not find anything with which to refute the argument he had\njust heard, and Tai-yü went on to say. “This offence can, anyhow, be\ncondoned; but, what is more, why did you also wink at Yün Erh? What was\nthis idea which you had resolved in your mind? wasn’t it perhaps that if\nshe played with me, she would be demeaning herself, and making herself\ncheap? She’s the daughter of a duke or a marquis, and we forsooth the\nmean progeny of a poor plebeian family; so that, had she diverted\nherself with me, wouldn’t she have exposed herself to being depreciated,\nhad I, perchance, said anything in retaliation? This was your idea\nwasn’t it? But though your purpose was, to be sure, honest enough, that\ngirl wouldn’t, however, receive any favours from you, but got angry with\nyou just as much as I did; and though she made me also a tool to do you\na good turn, she, on the contrary, asserts that I’m mean by nature and\ntake pleasure in irritating people in everything! and you again were\nafraid lest she should have hurt my feelings, but, had I had a row with\nher, what would that have been to you? and had she given me any offence,\nwhat concern would that too have been of yours?”",
        "When Pao-yü heard these words, he at once became alive to the fact that\nshe too had lent an ear to the private conversation he had had a short\nwhile back with Hsiang-yün: “All because of my, fears,” he carefully\nmused within himself, “lest these two should have a misunderstanding, I\nwas induced to come between them, and act as a mediator; but I myself\nhave, contrary to my hopes, incurred blame and abuse on both sides! This\njust accords with what I read the other day in the Nan Hua Ching. ’The\ningenious toil, the wise are full of care; the good-for-nothing seek for\nnothing, they feed on vegetables, and roam where they list; they wander\npurposeless like a boat not made fast!’ ’The mountain trees,’ the text\ngoes on to say, ’lead to their own devastation; the spring (conduces) to\nits own plunder; and so on.” And the more he therefore indulged in\nreflection, the more depressed he felt. “Now there are only these few\ngirls,” he proceeded to ponder minutely, “and yet, I’m unable to treat\nthem in such a way as to promote perfect harmony; and what will I\nforsooth do by and by (when there will be more to deal with)!”",
        "When he had reached this point in his cogitations, (he decided) that it\nwas really of no avail to agree with her, so that turning round, he was\nmaking his way all alone into his apartments; but Lin Tai-yü, upon\nnoticing that he had left her side, readily concluded that reflection\nhad marred his spirits and that he had so thoroughly lost his temper as\nto be going without even giving vent to a single word, and she could not\nrestrain herself from feeling inwardly more and more irritated. “After\nyou’ve gone this time,” she hastily exclaimed, “don’t come again, even\nfor a whole lifetime; and I won’t have you either so much as speak to\nme!”",
        "Pao-yü paid no heed to her, but came back to his rooms, and laying\nhimself down on his bed, he kept on muttering in a state of chagrin; and\nthough Hsi Jen knew full well the reasons of his dejection, she found it\ndifficult to summon up courage to say anything to him at the moment, and\r\nshe had no alternative but to try and distract him by means of\nirrelevant matters. “The theatricals which you’ve seen to-day,” she\nconsequently observed smiling, “will again lead to performances for\nseveral days, and Miss Pao-ch’ai will, I’m sure, give a return feast.”",
        "“Whether she gives a return feast or not,” Pao-yü rejoined with an\napathetic smirk, “is no concern of mine!”",
        "When Hsi Jen perceived the tone, so unlike that of other days, with\nwhich these words were pronounced: “What’s this that you’re saying?” she\ntherefore remarked as she gave another smile. “In this pleasant and\npropitious first moon, when all the ladies and young ladies are in high\nglee, how is it that you’re again in a mood of this sort?”",
        "“Whether the ladies and my cousins be in high spirits or not,” Pao-yü\nreplied forcing a grin, “is also perfectly immaterial to me.”",
        "“They are all,” Hsi Jen added, smilingly, “pleasant and agreeable, and\nwere you also a little pleasant and agreeable, wouldn’t it conduce to\nthe enjoyment of the whole company?”",
        "“What about the whole company, and they and I?” Pao-yü urged. “They all\nhave their mutual friendships; while I, poor fellow, all forlorn, have\nnone to care a rap for me.”",
        "His remarks had reached this clause, when inadvertently the tears\ntrickled down; and Hsi Jen realising the state of mind he was in, did\nnot venture to say anything further. But as soon as Pao-yü had reflected\nminutely over the sense and import of this sentence, he could not\nrefrain from bursting forth into a loud fit of crying, and, turning\nhimself round, he stood up, and, drawing near the table, he took up the\npencil, and eagerly composed these enigmatical lines:",
        "  If thou wert me to test, and I were thee to test,\n  Our hearts were we to test, and our minds to test,\n  When naught more there remains for us to test\n  That will yea very well be called a test,\n  And when there’s naught to put, we could say, to the test,\n  We will a place set up on which our feet to rest.",
        "After he had finished writing, he again gave way to fears that though he\nhimself could unfold their meaning, others, who came to peruse these\nlines, would not be able to fathom them, and he also went on\nconsequently to indite another stanza, in imitation of the “Parasitic\nPlant,” which he inscribed at the close of the enigma; and when he had\nread it over a second time, he felt his heart so free of all concern\nthat forthwith he got into his bed, and went to sleep.",
        "But, who would have thought it, Tai-yü, upon seeing Pao-yü take his\ndeparture in such an abrupt manner, designedly made use of the excuse\nthat she was bent upon finding Hsi Jen, to come round and see what he\nwas up to.",
        "“He’s gone to sleep long ago!” Hsi Jen replied.",
        "At these words, Tai-yü felt inclined to betake herself back at once; but\nHsi Jen smiled and said: “Please stop, miss. Here’s a slip of paper, and\nsee what there is on it!” and speedily taking what Pao-yü had written a\nshort while back, she handed it over to Tai-yü to examine. Tai-yü, on\nperusal, discovered that Pao-yü had composed it, at the spur of the\nmoment, when under the influence of resentment; and she could not help\nthinking it both a matter of ridicule as well as of regret; but she\nhastily explained to Hsi Jen: “This is written for fun, and there’s\nnothing of any consequence in it!” and having concluded this remark, she\nreadily took it along with her to her room, where she conned it over in\ncompany with Hsiang-yün; handing it also the next day to Pao-ch’ai to\nperuse. The burden of what Pao-ch’ai read was:",
        "  In what was no concern of mine, I should to thee have paid no heed,\n  For while I humour this, that one to please I don’t succeed!\n  Act as thy wish may be! go, come whene’er thou list; ’tis naught to\n      me.\n  Sorrow or joy, without limit or bound, to indulge thou art free!\n  What is this hazy notion about relatives distant or close?\n  For what purpose have I for all these days racked my heart with woes?\n  Even at this time when I look back and think, my mind no pleasure\n      knows.",
        "After having finished its perusal, she went on to glance at the\nBuddhistic stanza, and smiling: “This being,” she soliloquised; “has\nawakened to a sense of perception; and all through my fault, for it’s\nthat ballad of mine yesterday which has incited this! But the subtle\ndevices in all these rationalistic books have a most easy tendency to\nunsettle the natural disposition, and if to-morrow he does actually get\nup, and talk a lot of insane trash, won’t his having fostered this idea\nowe its origin to that ballad of mine; and shan’t I have become the\nprime of all guilty people?”",
        "Saying this, she promptly tore the paper, and, delivering the pieces to\nthe servant girls, she bade them go at once and burn them.",
        "“You shouldn’t have torn it!” Tai-yü remonstrated laughingly. “But wait\nand I’ll ask him about it! so come along all of you, and I vouch I’ll\nmake him abandon that idiotic frame of mind and that depraved language.”",
        "The three of them crossed over, in point of fact, into Pao-yü’s room,\nand Tai-yü was the first to smile and observe. “Pao-yü, may I ask you\nsomething? What is most valuable is a precious thing; and what is most\nfirm is jade, but what value do you possess and what firmness is innate\nin you?”",
        "But as Pao-yü could not, say anything by way of reply, two of them\nremarked sneeringly: “With all this doltish bluntness of his will he\nafter all absorb himself in abstraction?” While Hsiang-yün also clapped\nher hands and laughed, “Cousin Pao has been discomfited.”",
        "“The latter part of that apothegm of yours,” Tai-yü continued, “says:",
        " “We would then find some place on which our feet to rest.",
        "“Which is certainly good; but in my view, its excellence is not as yet\ncomplete! and I should still tag on two lines at its close;” as she\nproceeded to recite:",
        " “If we do not set up some place on which our feet to rest,\n  For peace and freedom then it will be best.”",
        "“There should, in very truth, be this adjunct to make it thoroughly\nexplicit!” Pao-ch’ai added. “In days of yore, the sixth founder of the\nSouthern sect, Hui Neng, came, when he went first in search of his\npatron, in the Shao Chou district; and upon hearing that the fifth\nfounder, Hung Jen, was at Huang Mei, he readily entered his service in\nthe capacity of Buddhist cook; and when the fifth founder, prompted by a\nwish to select a Buddhistic successor, bade his neophytes and all the\nbonzes to each compose an enigmatical stanza, the one who occupied the\nupper seat, Shen Hsiu, recited:",
        " “A P’u T’i tree the body is, the heart so like a stand of mirror\n      bright,\n  On which must needs, by constant careful rubbing, not be left dust to\n      alight!",
        "“And Hui Neng, who was at this time in the cook-house pounding rice,\noverheard this enigma. ’Excellent, it is excellent,’ he ventured, ’but\nas far as completeness goes it isn’t complete;’ and having bethought\nhimself of an apothegm: ’The P’u T’i, (an expression for Buddha or\nintelligence),’ he proceeded, ’is really no tree; and the resplendent\nmirror, (Buddhistic term for heart), is likewise no stand; and as, in\nfact, they do not constitute any tangible objects, how could they be\ncontaminated by particles of dust?’ Whereupon the fifth founder at once\ntook his robe and clap-dish and handed them to him. Well, the text now\nof this enigma presents too this identical idea, for the simple fact is\nthat those lines full of subtleties of a short while back are not, as\nyet, perfected or brought to an issue, and do you forsooth readily give\nup the task in this manner?”",
        "“He hasn’t been able to make any reply,” Tai-yü rejoined sneeringly,\n\"and must therefore be held to be discomfited; but were he even to make\nsuitable answer now, there would be nothing out of the common about it!\nAnyhow, from this time forth you mustn’t talk about Buddhistic spells,\nfor what even we two know and are able to do, you don’t as yet know and\ncan’t do; and do you go and concern yourself with abstraction?”",
        "Pao-yü had, in his own mind, been under the impression that he had\nattained perception, but when he was unawares and all of a sudden\nsubjected to this question by Tai-yü, he soon found it beyond his power\nto give any ready answer. And when Pao-ch’ai furthermore came out with a\nreligious disquisition, by way of illustration, and this on subjects, in\nall of which he had hitherto not seen them display any ability, he\ncommuned within himself: “If with their knowledge, which is indeed in\nadvance of that of mine, they haven’t, as yet, attained perception, what\nneed is there for me now to bring upon myself labour and vexation?”",
        "“Who has, pray,” he hastily inquired smilingly, after arriving at the\nend of his reflections, “indulged in Buddhistic mysteries? what I did\namounts to nothing more than nonsensical trash, written, at the spur of\nthe moment, and nothing else.”",
        "At the close of this remark all four came to be again on the same terms\nas of old; but suddenly a servant announced that the Empress (Yüan\nCh’un) had despatched a messenger to bring over a lantern-conundrum with\nthe directions that they should all go and guess it, and that after they\nhad found it out, they should each also devise one and send it in. At\nthese words, the four of them left the room with hasty step, and\nadjourned into dowager lady Chia’s drawing room, where they discovered a\nyoung eunuch, holding a four-cornered, flat-topped lantern, of white\ngauze, which had been specially fabricated for lantern riddles. On the\nfront side, there was already a conundrum, and the whole company were\nvying with each other in looking at it and making wild guesses; when the\nyoung eunuch went on to transmit his orders, saying: “Young ladies, you\nshould not speak out when you are guessing; but each one of you should\nsecretly write down the solutions for me to wrap them up, and take them\nall in together to await her Majesty’s personal inspection as to whether\nthey be correct or not.”",
        "Upon listening to these words, Pao-ch’ai drew near, and perceived at a\nglance, that it consisted of a stanza of four lines, with seven\ncharacters in each; but though there was no novelty or remarkable\nfeature about it, she felt constrained to outwardly give utterance to\nwords of praise. “It’s hard to guess!” she simply added, while she\npretended to be plunged in thought, for the fact is that as soon as she\nhad cast her eye upon it, she had at once solved it. Pao-yü, Tai-yü,\nHsiang-yün, and T’an-ch’un, had all four also hit upon the answer, and\neach had secretly put it in writing; and Chia Huan, Chia Lan and the\nothers were at the same time sent for, and every one of them set to work\nto exert the energies of his mind, and, when they arrived at a guess,\nthey noted it down on paper; after which every individual member of the\nfamily made a choice of some object, and composed a riddle, which was\ntranscribed in a large round hand, and affixed on the lantern. This\ndone, the eunuch took his departure, and when evening drew near, he came\nout and delivered the commands of the imperial consort. “The conundrum,\"\nhe said, “written by Her Highness, the other day, has been solved by\nevery one, with the exception of Miss Secunda and master Tertius, who\nmade a wrong guess. Those composed by you, young ladies, have likewise\nall been guessed; but Her Majesty does not know whether her solutions\nare right or not.” While speaking, he again produced the riddles, which\nhad been written by them, among which were those which had been solved,\nas well as those which had not been solved; and the eunuch, in like\nmanner, took the presents, conferred by the imperial consort, and handed\nthem over to those who had guessed right. To each person was assigned a\nbamboo vase, inscribed with verses, which had been manufactured for\npalace use, as well as articles of bamboo for tea; with the exception of\nYing-ch’un and Chia Huan, who were the only two persons who did not\nreceive any. But as Ying-ch’un looked upon the whole thing as a joke and\na trifle, she did not trouble her mind on that score, but Chia Huan at\nonce felt very disconsolate.",
        "“This one devised by Mr. Tertius,” the eunuch was further heard to say,\n\"is not properly done; and as Her Majesty herself has been unable to\nguess it she commanded me to bring it back, and ask Mr. Tertius what it\nis about.”",
        "After the party had listened to these words, they all pressed forward to\nsee what had been written. The burden of it was this:",
        "  The elder brother has horns only eight;\n  The second brother has horns only two;\n  The elder brother on the bed doth sit;\n  Inside the room the second likes to squat.",
        "After perusal of these lines, they broke out, with one voice, into a\nloud fit of laughter; and Chia Huan had to explain to the eunuch that\nthe one was a pillow, and the other the head of an animal. Having\ncommitted the explanation to memory and accepted a cup of tea, the\neunuch took his departure; and old lady Chia, noticing in what buoyant\nspirits Yüan Ch’un was, felt herself so much the more elated, that\nissuing forthwith directions to devise, with every despatch, a small but\ningenious lantern of fine texture in the shape of a screen, and put it\nin the Hall, she bade each of her grandchildren secretly compose a\nconundrum, copy it out clean, and affix it on the frame of the lantern;\nand she had subsequently scented tea and fine fruits, as well as every\nkind of nicknacks, got ready, as prizes for those who guessed right.",
        "And when Chia Cheng came from court and found the old lady in such high\nglee he also came over in the evening, as the season was furthermore\nholiday time, to avail himself of her good cheer to reap some enjoyment.\nIn the upper part of the room seated themselves, at one table dowager\nlady Chia, Chia Cheng, and Pao-yü; madame Wang, Pao-ch’ai, Tai-yü,\nHsiang-yün sat round another table, and Ying-ch’un, Tan-ch’un and Hsi\nCh’un the three of them, occupied a separate table, and both these\ntables were laid in the lower part, while below, all over the floor,\nstood matrons and waiting-maids for Li Kung-ts’ai and Hsi-feng were both\nseated in the inner section of the Hall, at another table.",
        "Chia Chen failed to see Chia Lan, and he therefore inquired: “How is it\nI don’t see brother Lan,” whereupon the female servants, standing below,\nhastily entered the inner room and made inquiries of widow Li. “He\nsays,” Mrs. Li stood up and rejoined with a smile, “that as your master\ndidn’t go just then to ask him round, he has no wish to come!” and when\na matron delivered the reply to Chia Cheng; the whole company exclaimed\nmuch amused: “How obstinate and perverse his natural disposition is!\"\nBut Chia Cheng lost no time in sending Chia Huan, together with two\nmatrons, to fetch Chia Lan; and, on his arrival, dowager lady Chia bade\nhim sit by her side, and, taking a handful of fruits, she gave them to\nhim to eat; after which the party chatted, laughed, and enjoyed\nthemselves.",
        "Ordinarily, there was no one but Pao-yü to say much or talk at any\nlength, but on this day, with Chia Cheng present, his remarks were\nlimited to assents. And as to the rest, Hsiang-yün had, though a young\ngirl, and of delicate physique, nevertheless ever been very fond of\ntalking and discussing; but, on this instance, Chia Cheng was at the\nfeast, so that she also held her tongue and restrained her words. As for\nTai-yü she was naturally peevish and listless, and not very much\ninclined to indulge in conversation; while Pao-ch’ai, who had never been\nreckless in her words or frivolous in her deportment, likewise behaved\non the present occasion in her usual dignified manner. Hence it was that\nthis banquet, although a family party, given for the sake of relaxation,\nassumed contrariwise an appearance of restraint, and as old lady Chia\nwas herself too well aware that it was to be ascribed to the presence of\nChia Cheng alone, she therefore, after the wine had gone round three\ntimes, forthwith hurried off Chia Cheng to retire to rest.",
        "No less cognisant was Chia Cheng himself that the old lady’s motives in\npacking him off were to afford a favourable opportunity to the young\nladies and young men to enjoy themselves, and that is why, forcing a\nsmile, he observed: “Having to-day heard that your venerable ladyship\nhad got up in here a large assortment of excellent riddles, on the\noccasion of the spring festival of lanterns, I too consequently prepared\nprizes, as well as a banquet, and came with the express purpose of\njoining the company; and why don’t you in some way confer a fraction of\nthe fond love, which you cherish for your grandsons and granddaughters,\nupon me also, your son?”",
        "“When you’re here,” old lady Chia replied smilingly, “they won’t venture\nto chat or laugh; and unless you go, you’ll really fill me with intense\ndejection! But if you feel inclined to guess conundrums, well, I’ll tell\nyou one for you to solve; but if you don’t guess right, mind, you’ll be\nmulcted!”",
        "“Of course I’ll submit to the penalty,” Chia Cheng rejoined eagerly, as\nhe laughed, “but if I do guess right, I must in like manner receive a\nreward!”",
        "“This goes without saying!” dowager lady Chia added; whereupon she went\non to recite:",
        "  The monkey’s body gently rests on the tree top!",
        "“This refers,” she said, “to the name of a fruit.”",
        "Chia Cheng was already aware that it was a lichee, but he designedly\nmade a few guesses at random, and was fined several things; but he\nsubsequently gave, at length, the right answer, and also obtained a\npresent from her ladyship.",
        "In due course he too set forth this conundrum for old lady Chia to\nguess:",
        "  Correct its body is in appearance,\n  Both firm and solid is it in substance;\n  To words, it is true, it cannot give vent,\n  But spoken to, it always does assent.",
        "When he had done reciting it, he communicated the answer in an undertone\nto Pao-yü; and Pao-yü fathoming what his intention was, gently too told\nhis grandmother Chia, and her ladyship finding, after some reflection,\nthat there was really no mistake about it, readily remarked that it was\nan inkslab.",
        "“After all,” Chia Cheng smiled; “Your venerable ladyship it is who can\nhit the right answer with one guess!” and turning his head round, “Be\nquick,” he cried, “and bring the prizes and present them!” whereupon the\nmarried women and waiting-maids below assented with one voice, and they\nsimultaneously handed up the large trays and small boxes.",
        "Old lady Chia passed the things, one by one, under inspection; and\nfinding that they consisted of various kinds of articles, novel and\ningenious, of use and of ornament, in vogue during the lantern festival,\nher heart was so deeply elated that with alacrity she shouted, “Pour a\nglass of wine for your master!”",
        "Pao-yü took hold of the decanter, while Ying Ch’un presented the cup of\nwine.",
        "“Look on that screen!” continued dowager lady Chia, “all those riddles\nhave been written by the young ladies; so go and guess them for my\nbenefit!”",
        "Chia Cheng signified his obedience, and rising and walking up to the\nfront of the screen, he noticed the first riddle, which was one composed\nby the Imperial consort Yüan, in this strain:",
        "  The pluck of devils to repress in influence it abounds,\n  Like bound silk is its frame, and like thunder its breath resounds.\n  But one report rattles, and men are lo! in fear and dread;\n  Transformed to ashes ’tis what time to see you turn the head.",
        "“Is this a cracker?” Chia Cheng inquired.",
        "“It is,” Pao-yü assented.",
        "Chia Cheng then went on to peruse that of Ying-Ch’un’s, which referred\nto an article of use:",
        "  Exhaustless is the principle of heavenly calculations and of human\n      skill;\n  Skill may exist, but without proper practice the result to find hard\n      yet\n  will be!\n  Whence cometh all this mixed confusion on a day so still?\n  Simply it is because the figures Yin and Yang do not agree.",
        "“It’s an abacus,” Chia Cheng observed.",
        "“Quite so!” replied Ying Ch’un smiling; after which they also conned the\none below, by T’an-ch’un, which ran thus and had something to do with an\nobject:",
        "  This is the time when ’neath the stairs the pages their heads raise!\n  The term of “pure brightness” is the meetest time this thing to make!\n  The vagrant silk it snaps, and slack, without tension it strays!\n  The East wind don’t begrudge because its farewell it did take!",
        "“It would seem,” Chia Cheng suggested, “as if that must be a kite!”",
        "“It is,” answered T’an C’h’un; whereupon Chia Cheng read the one below,\nwhich was written by Tai-yü to this effect and bore upon some thing:",
        "  After the audience, his two sleeves who brings with fumes replete?\n  Both by the lute and in the quilt, it lacks luck to abide!\n  The dawn it marks; reports from cock and man renders effete!\n  At midnight, maids no trouble have a new one to provide!\n  The head, it glows during the day, as well as in the night!\n  Its heart, it burns from day to day and ’gain from year to year!\n  Time swiftly flies and mete it is that we should hold it dear!\n  Changes might come, but it defies wind, rain, days dark or bright!",
        "“Isn’t this a scented stick to show the watch?” Chia Cheng inquired.",
        "“Yes!” assented Pao-yü, speaking on Tai-yü’s behalf; and Chia Cheng\nthereupon prosecuted the perusal of a conundrum, which ran as follows,\nand referred to an object;",
        "  With the South, it sits face to face,\n  And the North, the while, it doth face;\n  If the figure be sad, it also is sad,\n  If the figure be glad, it likewise is glad!",
        "“Splendid! splendid!” exclaimed Chia Cheng, “my guess is that it’s a\nlooking-glass. It’s excellently done!”",
        "Pao-yü smiled. “It is a looking glass!” he rejoined.",
        "“This is, however, anonymous; whose work is it?” Chia Cheng went on to\nask, and dowager lady Chia interposed: “This, I fancy, must have been\ncomposed by Pao-yü,” and Chia Cheng then said not a word, but continued\nreading the following conundrum, which was that devised by Pao-ch’ai, on\nsome article or other:",
        "  Eyes though it has; eyeballs it has none, and empty ’tis inside!\n  The lotus flowers out of the water peep, and they with gladness meet,\n  But when dryandra leaves begin to drop, they then part and divide,\n  For a fond pair they are, but, united, winter they cannot greet.",
        "When Chia Cheng finished scanning it, he gave way to reflection. “This\nobject,” he pondered, “must surely be limited in use! But for persons of\ntender years to indulge in all this kind of language, would seem to be\nstill less propitious; for they cannot, in my views, be any of them the\nsort of people to enjoy happiness and longevity!” When his reflections\nreached this point, he felt the more dejected, and plainly betrayed a\nsad appearance, and all he did was to droop his head and to plunge in a\nbrown study.",
        "But upon perceiving the frame of mind in which Chia Cheng was, dowager\nlady Chia arrived at the conclusion that he must be fatigued; and\nfearing, on the other hand, that if she detained him, the whole party of\nyoung ladies would lack the spirit to enjoy themselves, she there and\nthen faced Chia Cheng and suggested: “There’s no need really for you to\nremain here any longer, and you had better retire to rest; and let us\nsit a while longer; after which, we too will break up!”",
        "As soon as Chia Cheng caught this hint, he speedily assented several\nconsecutive yes’s; and when he had further done his best to induce old\nlady Chia to have a cup of wine, he eventually withdrew out of the Hall.\nOn his return to his bedroom, he could do nothing else than give way to\ncogitation, and, as he turned this and turned that over in his mind, he\ngot still more sad and pained.",
        "“Amuse yourselves now!” readily exclaimed dowager lady Chia, during this\nwhile, after seeing Chia Cheng off; but this remark was barely finished,\nwhen she caught sight of Pao-yü run up to the lantern screen, and give\nvent, as he gesticulated with his hands and kicked his feet about, to\nany criticisms that first came to his lips. “In this,” he remarked,\n\"this line isn’t happy; and that one, hasn’t been suitably solved!\"\nwhile he behaved just like a monkey, whose fetters had been let loose.",
        "“Were the whole party after all,” hastily ventured Tai-yü, “to sit down,\nas we did a short while back and chat and laugh; wouldn’t that be more\nin accordance with good manners?”",
        "Lady Feng thereupon egressed from the room in the inner end and\ninterposed her remarks. “Such a being as you are,” she said, “shouldn’t\nsurely be allowed by Mr. Chia Cheng, an inch or a step from his side,\nand then you’ll be all right. But just then it slipped my memory, for\nwhy didn’t I, when your father was present, instigate him to bid you\ncompose a rhythmical enigma; and you would, I have no doubt, have been\nup to this moment in a state of perspiration!”",
        "At these words, Pao-yü lost all patience, and laying hold of lady Feng,\nhe hustled her about for a few moments.",
        "But old lady Chia went on for some time to bandy words with Li\nKung-ts’ai, with the whole company of young ladies and the rest, so that\nshe, in fact, felt considerably tired and worn out; and when she heard\nthat the fourth watch had already drawn nigh, she consequently issued\ndirections that the eatables should be cleared away and given to the\ncrowd of servants, and suggested, as she readily rose to her feet, “Let\nus go and rest! for the next day is also a feast, and we must get up at\nan early hour; and to-morrow evening we can enjoy ourselves again!\"\nwhereupon the whole company dispersed.",
        "But now, reader, listen to the sequel given in the chapter which\nfollows.",
        "  Pao-yü and Tai-yü make use of some beautiful passages from the Record\n      of the Western Side-building to bandy jokes.\n  The excellent ballads sung in the Peony Pavilion touch the tender\n      heart of Tai-yü.",
        "Soon after the day on which Chia Yuan-ch’un honoured the garden of Broad\nVista with a visit, and her return to the Palace, so our story goes, she\nforthwith desired that T’an-ch’un should make a careful copy, in\nconsecutive order, of the verses, which had been composed and read out\non that occasion, in order that she herself should assign them their\nrank, and adjudge the good and bad. And she also directed that an\ninscription should be engraved on a stone, in the Broad Vista park, to\nserve in future years as a record of the pleasant and felicitous event;\nand Chia Cheng, therefore, gave orders to servants to go far and wide,\nand select skilful artificers and renowned workmen, to polish the stone\nand engrave the characters in the garden of Broad Vista; while Chia Chen\nput himself at the head of Chia Jung, Chia P’ing and others to\nsuperintend the work. And as Chia Se had, on the other hand, the control\nof Wen Kuan and the rest of the singing girls, twelve in all, as well as\nof their costumes and other properties, he had no leisure to attend to\nanything else, and consequently once again sent for Chia Ch’ang and Chia\nLing to come and act as overseers.",
        "On a certain day, the works were taken in hand for rubbing the stones\nsmooth with wax, for carving the inscription, and tracing it with\nvermilion, but without entering into details on these matters too\nminutely, we will return to the two places, the Yu Huang temple and the\nTa Mo monastery. The company of twelve young bonzes and twelve young\nTaoist priests had now moved out of the Garden of Broad Vista, and Chia\nCheng was meditating upon distributing them to various temples to live\napart, when unexpectedly Chia Ch’in’s mother, née Chou,–who resided in\nthe back street, and had been at the time contemplating to pay a visit\nto Chia Cheng on this side so as to obtain some charge, be it either\nlarge or small, for her son to look after, that he too should be put in\nthe way of turning up some money to meet his expenses with,–came, as\nluck would have it, to hear that some work was in hand in this mansion,\nand lost no time in driving over in a curricle and making her appeal to\nlady Feng. And as lady Feng remembered that she had all along not\npresumed on her position to put on airs, she willingly acceded to her\nrequest, and after calling to memory some suitable remarks, she at once\nwent to make her report to madame Wang: “These young bonzes and Taoist\npriests,” she said, “can by no means be sent over to other places; for\nwere the Imperial consort to come out at an unexpected moment, they\nwould then be required to perform services; and in the event of their\nbeing scattered, there will, when the time comes to requisition their\nhelp, again be difficulties in the way; and my idea is that it would be\nbetter to send them all to the family temple, the Iron Fence Temple; and\nevery month all there will be to do will be to depute some one to take\nover a few taels for them to buy firewood and rice with, that’s all, and\nwhen there’s even a sound of their being required uttered, some one can\nat once go and tell them just one word ’come,’ and they will come\nwithout the least trouble!”",
        "Madame Wang gave a patient ear to this proposal, and, in due course,\nconsulted with Chia Cheng.",
        "“You’ve really,” smiled Chia Cheng at these words, “reminded me how I\nshould act! Yes, let this be done!” And there and then he sent for Chia\nLien.",
        "Chia Lien was, at the time, having his meal with lady Feng, but as soon\nas he heard that he was wanted, he put by his rice and was just walking\noff, when lady Feng clutched him and pulled him back. “Wait a while,\"\nshe observed with a smirk, “and listen to what I’ve got to tell you! if\nit’s about anything else, I’ve nothing to do with it; but if it be about\nthe young bonzes and young Taoists, you must, in this particular matter,\nplease comply with this suggestion of mine,” after which, she went on in\nthis way and that way to put him up to a whole lot of hints.",
        "“I know nothing about it,” Chia Lien rejoined smilingly, “and as you\nhave the knack you yourself had better go and tell him!”",
        "But as soon as lady Feng heard this remark, she stiffened her head and\nthrew down the chopsticks; and, with an expression on her cheeks, which\nlooked like a smile and yet not a smile, she glanced angrily at Chia\nLien. “Are you speaking in earnest,” she inquired, “or are you only\njesting?”",
        "“Yün Erh, the son of our fifth sister-in-law of the western porch, has\ncome and appealed to me two or three times, asking for something to look\nafter,” Chia Lien laughed, “and I assented and bade him wait; and now,\nafter a great deal of trouble, this job has turned up; and there you are\nonce again snatching it away!”",
        "“Compose your mind,” lady Feng observed grinning, “for the Imperial\nConsort has hinted that directions should be given for the planting, in\nthe north-east corner of the park, of a further plentiful supply of pine\nand cedar trees, and that orders should also be issued for the addition,\nround the base of the tower, of a large number of flowers and plants and\nsuch like; and when this job turns up, I can safely tell you that Yun\nErh will be called to assume control of these works.”",
        "“Well if that be really so,” Chia Lien rejoined, “it will after all do!\nBut there’s only one thing; all I was up to last night was simply to\nhave some fun with you, but you obstinately and perversely wouldn’t.”",
        "Lady Feng, upon hearing these words, burst out laughing with a sound of\nCh’ih, and spurting disdainfully at Chia Lien, she lowered her head and\nwent on at once with her meal; during which time Chia Lien speedily\nwalked away laughing the while, and betook himself to the front, where\nhe saw Chia Cheng. It was, indeed, about the young bonzes, and Chia Lien\nreadily carried out lady Feng’s suggestion. “As from all appearances,\"\nhe continued, “Ch’in Erh has, actually, so vastly improved, this job\nshould, after all, be entrusted to his care and management; and provided\nthat in observance with the inside custom Ch’in Erh were each day told\nto receive the advances, things will go on all right.” And as Chia Cheng\nhad never had much attention to give to such matters of detail, he, as\nsoon as he heard what Chia Lien had to say, immediately signified his\napproval and assent. And Chia Lien, on his return to his quarters,\ncommunicated the issue to lady Feng; whereupon lady Feng at once sent\nsome one to go and notify dame Chou.",
        "Chia Ch’in came, in due course, to pay a visit to Chia Lien and his\nwife, and was incessant in his expressions of gratitude; and lady Feng\nbestowed upon him a further favour by giving him, as a first instalment,\nan advance of the funds necessary for three months’ outlay, for which\nshe bade him write a receipt; while Chia Lien filled up a cheque and\nsigned it; and a counter-order was simultaneously issued, and he came\nout into the treasury where the sum specified for three months’\nsupplies, amounting to three hundred taels, was paid out in pure ingots.",
        "Chia Ch’in took the first piece of silver that came under his hand, and\ngave it to the men in charge of the scales, with which he told them to\nhave a cup of tea, and bidding, shortly after, a boy-servant take the\nmoney to his home, he held consultation with his mother; after which, he\nhired a donkey for himself to ride on, and also bespoke several\ncarriages, and came to the back gate of the Jung Kuo mansion; where\nhaving called out the twenty young priests, they got into the carriages,\nand sped straightway beyond the city walls, to the Temple of the Iron\nFence, where nothing of any note transpired at the time.",
        "But we will now notice Chia Yüan-ch’un, within the precincts of the\nPalace. When she had arranged the verses composed in the park of Broad\nVista in their order of merit, she suddenly recollected that the sights\nin the garden were sure, ever since her visit through them, to be\ndiligently and respectfully kept locked up by her father and mother; and\nthat by not allowing any one to go in was not an injustice done to this\ngarden? “Besides,” (she pondered), “in that household, there are at\npresent several young ladies, capable of composing odes, and able to\nwrite poetry, and why should not permission be extended to them to go\nand take their quarters in it; in order too that those winsome persons\nmight not be deprived of good cheer, and that the flowers and willows\nmay not lack any one to admire them!”",
        "But remembering likewise that Pao-yü had from his infancy grown up among\nthat crowd of female cousins, and was such a contrast to the rest of his\nmale cousins that were he not allowed to move into it, he would, she\nalso apprehended, be made to feel forlorn; and dreading lest his\ngrandmother and his mother should be displeased at heart, she thought it\nimperative that he too should be permitted to take up his quarters\ninside, so that things should be put on a satisfactory footing; and\ndirecting the eunuch Hsia Chung to go to the Jung mansion and deliver\nher commands, she expressed the wish that Pao-ch’ai and the other girls\nshould live in the garden and that it should not be kept closed, and\nurged that Pao-yü should also shift into it, at his own pleasure, for\nthe prosecution of his studies. And Chia Cheng and madame Wang, upon\nreceiving her commands, hastened, after the departure of Hsia Chung, to\nexplain them to dowager lady Chia, and to despatch servants into the\ngarden to tidy every place, to dust, to sweep, and to lay out the\nportieres and bed-curtains. The tidings were heard by the rest even with\nperfect equanimity, but Pao-yü was immoderately delighted; and he was\nengaged in deliberation with dowager lady Chia as to this necessary and\nto that requirement, when suddenly they descried a waiting-maid arrive,\nwho announced: “Master wishes to see Pao-yü.”",
        "Pao-yü gazed vacantly for a while. His spirits simultaneously were swept\naway; his countenance changed colour; and clinging to old lady Chia, he\nreadily wriggled her about, just as one would twist the sugar (to make\nsweetmeats with), and could not, for the very death of him, summon up\ncourage to go; so that her ladyship had no alternative but to try and\nreassure him. “My precious darling” she urged, “just you go, and I’ll\nstand by you! He won’t venture to be hard upon you; and besides, you’ve\ndevised these excellent literary compositions; and I presume as Her\nMajesty has desired that you should move into the garden, his object is\nto give you a few words of advice; simply because he fears that you\nmight be up to pranks in those grounds. But to all he tells you,\nwhatever you do, mind you acquiesce and it will be all right!”",
        "And as she tried to compose him, she at the same time called two old\nnurses and enjoined them to take Pao-yü over with due care, “And don’t\nlet his father,” she added, “frighten him!”",
        "The old nurses expressed their obedience, and Pao-yü felt constrained to\nwalk ahead; and with one step scarcely progressing three inches, he\nleisurely came over to this side. Strange coincidence Chia Cheng was in\nmadame Wang’s apartments consulting with her upon some matter or other,\nand Chin Ch’uan-erh, Ts’ai Yun, Ts’ai Feng, Ts’ai Luan, Hsiu Feng and\nthe whole number of waiting-maids were all standing outside under the\nverandah. As soon as they caught sight of Pao-yü, they puckered up their\nmouths and laughed at him; while Chin Ch’uan grasped Pao-yü with one\nhand, and remarked in a low tone of voice: “On these lips of mine has\njust been rubbed cosmetic, soaked with perfume, and are you now inclined\nto lick it or not?” whereupon Ts’ai Yün pushed off Chin Ch’uan with one\nshove, as she interposed laughingly, “A person’s heart is at this moment\nin low spirits and do you still go on cracking jokes at him? But avail\nyourself of this opportunity when master is in good cheer to make haste\nand get in!”",
        "Pao-yü had no help but to sidle against the door and walk in. Chia Cheng\nand madame Wang were, in fact, both in the inner rooms, and dame Chou\nraised the portière. Pao-yü stepped in gingerly and perceived Chia Cheng\nand madame Wang sitting opposite to each other, on the stove-couch,\nengaged in conversation; while below on a row of chairs sat Ying Ch’un,\nT’an Ch’un, Hsi Ch’un and Chia Huan; but though all four of them were\nseated in there only T’an Ch’un, Hsi Ch’un and Chia Huan rose to their\nfeet, as soon as they saw him make his appearance in the room; and when\nChia Cheng raised his eyes and noticed Pao-yü standing in front of him,\nwith a gait full of ease and with those winsome looks of his, so\ncaptivating, he once again realised what a mean being Chia Huan was, and\nhow coarse his deportment. But suddenly he also bethought himself of\nChia Chu, and as he reflected too that madame Wang had only this son of\nher own flesh and blood, upon whom she ever doated as upon a gem, and\nthat his own beard had already begun to get hoary, the consequence was\nthat he unwittingly stifled, well nigh entirely, the feeling of hatred\nand dislike, which, during the few recent years he had ordinarily\nfostered towards Pao-yü. And after a long pause, “Her Majesty,” he\nobserved, “bade you day after day ramble about outside to disport\nyourself, with the result that you gradually became remiss and lazy; but\nnow her desire is that we should keep you under strict control, and that\nin prosecuting your studies in the company of your cousins in the\ngarden, you should carefully exert your brains to learn; so that if you\ndon’t again attend to your duties, and mind your regular tasks, you had\nbetter be on your guard!” Pao-yü assented several consecutive yes’s;\nwhereupon madame Wang drew him by her side and made him sit down, and\r\nwhile his three cousins resumed the seats they previously occupied:\n\"Have you finished all the pills you had been taking a short while\nback?” madame Wang inquired, as she rubbed Pao-yü’s neck.",
        "“There’s still one pill remaining,” Pao-yü explained by way of reply.",
        "“You had better,” madame Wang added, “fetch ten more pills tomorrow\nmorning; and every day about bedtime tell Hsi Jen to give them to you;\nand when you’ve had one you can go to sleep!”",
        "“Ever since you, mother, bade me take them,” Pao-yü rejoined, “Hsi Jen\nhas daily sent me one, when I was about to turn in.”",
        "“Who’s this called Hsi Jen?” Chia Chen thereupon ascertained.",
        "“She’s a waiting-maid!” madame Wang answered.",
        "“A servant girl,” Chia Cheng remonstrated, “can be called by whatever\nname one chooses; anything is good enough; but who’s it who has started\nthis kind of pretentious name!”",
        "Madame Wang noticed that Chia Cheng was not in a happy frame of mind, so\nthat she forthwith tried to screen matters for Pao-yü, by saying: “It’s\nour old lady who has originated it!”",
        "“How can it possibly be,” Chia Cheng exclaimed, “that her ladyship knows\nanything about such kind of language? It must, for a certainty, be\nPao-yü!”",
        "Pao-yü perceiving that he could not conceal the truth from him, was\nunder the necessity of standing up and of explaining; “As I have all\nalong read verses, I remembered the line written by an old poet:",
        " “What time the smell of flowers wafts itself into man, one knows the\n      day is warm.",
        "“And as this waiting-maid’s surname was Hua (flower), I readily gave her\nthe name, on the strength of this sentiment.”",
        "“When you get back,” madame Wang speedily suggested addressing Pao-yü,\n\"change it and have done; and you, sir, needn’t lose your temper over\nsuch a trivial matter!”",
        "“It doesn’t really matter in the least,” Chia Cheng continued; “so that\nthere’s no necessity of changing it; but it’s evident that Pao-yü\ndoesn’t apply his mind to legitimate pursuits, but mainly devotes his\nenergies to such voluptuous expressions and wanton verses!” And as he\nfinished these words, he abruptly shouted out: “You brute-like child of\nretribution! Don’t you yet get out of this?”",
        "“Get away, off with you!” madame Wang in like manner hastened to urge;\n\"our dowager lady is waiting, I fear, for you to have her repast!”",
        "Pao-yü assented, and, with gentle step, he withdrew out of the room,\nlaughing at Chin Ch’uan-erh, as he put out his tongue; and leading off\nthe two nurses, he went off on his way like a streak of smoke. But no\nsooner had he reached the door of the corridor than he espied Hsi Jen\nstanding leaning against the side; who perceiving Pao-yü come back safe\nand sound heaped smile upon smile, and asked: “What did he want you\nfor?”",
        "“There was nothing much,” Pao-yü explained, “he simply feared that I\nwould, when I get into the garden, be up to mischief, and he gave me all\nsorts of advice;” and, as while he explained matters, they came into the\npresence of lady Chia, he gave her a clear account, from first to last,\nof what had transpired. But when he saw that Lin Tai-yü was at the\nmoment in the room, Pao-yü speedily inquired of her: “Which place do you\nthink best to live in?”",
        "Tai-yü had just been cogitating on this subject, so that when she\nunexpectedly heard Pao-yü’s inquiry, she forthwith rejoined with a\nsmile: “My own idea is that the Hsio Hsiang Kuan is best; for I’m fond\nof those clusters of bamboos, which hide from view the tortuous\nbalustrade and make the place more secluded and peaceful than any\nother!”",
        "Pao-yü at these words clapped his hands and smiled. “That just meets\nwith my own views!” he remarked; “I too would like you to go and live in\nthere; and as I am to stay in the I Hung Yuan, we two will be, in the\nfirst place, near each other; and next, both in quiet and secluded\nspots.”",
        "While the two of them were conversing, a servant came, sent over by Chia\nCheng, to report to dowager lady Chia that: “The 22nd of the second moon\nwas a propitious day for Pao-yü and the young ladies to shift their\nquarters into the garden; that during these few days, servants should be\nsent in to put things in their proper places and to clean; that Hsueh\nPao-ch’ai should put up in the Heng Wu court; that Lin Tai-yü was to\nlive in the Hsiao Hsiang lodge; that Chia Ying-ch’un should move into\nthe Cho Chin two-storied building; that T’an Ch’un should put up in the\nCh’iu Yen library; that Hsi Ch’un should take up her quarters in the\nLiao Feng house; that widow Li should live in the Tao Hsiang village,\nand that Pao-yü was to live in the I Hung court. That at every place two\nold nurses should be added and four servant-girls; that exclusive of the\nnurse and personal waiting-maid of each, there should, in addition, be\nservants, whose special duties should be to put things straight and to\nsweep the place; and that on the 22nd, they should all, in a body, move\ninto the garden.”",
        "When this season drew near, the interior of the grounds, with the\nflowers waving like embroidered sashes, and the willows fanned by the\nfragrant breeze, was no more as desolate and silent as it had been in\nprevious days; but without indulging in any further irrelevant details,\nwe shall now go back to Pao-yü.",
        "Ever since he shifted his quarters into the park, his heart was full of\njoy, and his mind of contentment, fostering none of those extraordinary\nideas, whose tendency could be to give birth to longings and hankerings.\nDay after day, he simply indulged, in the company of his female cousins\nand the waiting-maids, in either reading his books, or writing\ncharacters, or in thrumming the lute, playing chess, drawing pictures\nand scanning verses, even in drawing patterns of argus pheasants, in\nembroidering phoenixes, contesting with them in searching for strange\nplants, and gathering flowers, in humming poetry with gentle tone,\nsinging ballads with soft voice, dissecting characters, and in playing\nat mora, so that, being free to go everywhere and anywhere, he was of\ncourse completely happy. From his pen emanate four ballads on the times\nof the four seasons, which, although they could not be looked upon as\nfirst-rate, afford anyhow a correct idea of his sentiments, and a true\naccount of the scenery.",
        "The ballad on the spring night runs as follows:",
        "  The silken curtains, thin as russet silk, at random are spread out.\n  The croak of frogs from the adjoining lane but faintly strikes the\n      ear.\n  The pillow a slight chill pervades, for rain outside the window falls.\n  The landscape, which now meets the eye, is like that seen in dreams by\n      man.\n  In plenteous streams the candles’ tears do drop, but for whom do they\n      weep?\n  Each particle of grief felt by the flowers is due to anger against me.\n  It’s all because the maids have by indulgence indolent been made.\n  The cover over me I’ll pull, as I am loth to laugh and talk for long.",
        "This is the description of the aspect of nature on a summer night:",
        "  The beauteous girl, weary of needlework, quiet is plunged in a long\n      dream.\n  The parrot in the golden cage doth shout that it is time the tea to\n      brew.\n  The lustrous windows with the musky moon like open palace-mirrors\n      look;\n  The room abounds with fumes of sandalwood and all kinds of imperial\n      scents.\n  From the cups made of amber is poured out the slippery dew from the\n      lotus.\n  The banisters of glass, the cool zephyr enjoy flapped by the willow\n      trees.\n  In the stream-spanning kiosk, the curtains everywhere all at one time\n      do wave.\n  In the vermilion tower the blinds the maidens roll, for they have made\n      the night’s toilette.",
        "The landscape of an autumnal evening is thus depicted:",
        "  In the interior of the Chiang Yün house are hushed all clamorous din\n      and noise.\n  The sheen, which from Selene flows, pervades the windows of carnation\n      gauze.\n  The moss-locked, streaked rocks shelter afford to the cranes, plunged\n      in sleep.\n  The dew, blown on the t’ung tree by the well, doth wet the roosting\n      rooks.\n  Wrapped in a quilt, the maid comes the gold phoenix coverlet to\n      spread.\n  The girl, who on the rails did lean, on her return drops the\n      kingfisher flowers!\n  This quiet night his eyes in sleep he cannot close, as he doth long\n      for wine.\n  The smoke is stifled, and the fire restirred, when tea is ordered to\n      be brewed.",
        "The picture of a winter night is in this strain:",
        "  The sleep of the plum trees, the dream of the bamboos the third watch\n      have already reached.\n  Under the embroidered quilt and the kingfisher coverlet one can’t\n      sleep for the cold.\n  The shadow of fir trees pervades the court, but cranes are all that\n      meet the eye.\n  Both far and wide the pear blossom covers the ground, but yet the hawk\n      cannot be heard.\n  The wish, verses to write, fostered by the damsel with the green\n      sleeves, has waxéd cold.\n  The master, with the gold sable pelisse, cannot endure much wine.\n  But yet he doth rejoice that his attendant knows the way to brew the\n      tea.\n  The newly-fallen snow is swept what time for tea the water must be\n      boiled.",
        "But putting aside Pao-yü, as he leisurely was occupied in scanning some\nverses, we will now allude to all these ballads. There lived, at that\ntime, a class of people, whose wont was to servilely court the\ninfluential and wealthy, and who, upon perceiving that the verses were\ncomposed by a young lad of the Jung Kuo mansion, of only twelve or\nthirteen years of age, had copies made, and taking them outside sang\ntheir praise far and wide. There were besides another sort of\nlight-headed young men, whose heart was so set upon licentious and\nseductive lines, that they even inscribed them on fans and screen-walls,\nand time and again kept on humming them and extolling them. And to the\nabove reasons must therefore be ascribed the fact that persons came in\nsearch of stanzas and in quest of manuscripts, to apply for sketches and\nto beg for poetical compositions, to the increasing satisfaction of\nPao-yü, who day after day, when at home, devoted his time and attention\nto these extraneous matters. But who would have anticipated that he\ncould ever in his quiet seclusion have become a prey to a spirit of\nrestlessness? Of a sudden, one day he began to feel discontent, finding\nfault with this and turning up his nose at that; and going in and coming\nout he was simply full of ennui. And as all the girls in the garden were\njust in the prime of youth, and at a time of life when, artless and\nunaffected, they sat and reclined without regard to retirement, and\ndisported themselves and joked without heed, how could they ever have\ncome to read the secrets which at this time occupied a place in the\nheart of Pao-yü? But so unhappy was Pao-yü within himself that he soon\nfelt loth to stay in the garden, and took to gadding about outside like\nan evil spirit; but he behaved also the while in an idiotic manner.",
        "Ming Yen, upon seeing him go on in this way, felt prompted, with the\nidea of affording his mind some distraction, to think of this and to\ndevise that expedient; but everything had been indulged in with surfeit\nby Pao-yü, and there was only this resource, (that suggested itself to\nhim,) of which Pao-yü had not as yet had any experience. Bringing his\nreflections to a close, he forthwith came over to a bookshop, and\nselecting novels, both of old and of the present age, traditions\nintended for outside circulation on Fei Yen, Ho Te, Wu Tse-t’ien, and\nYang Kuei-fei, as well as books of light literature consisting of\nstrange legends, he purchased a good number of them with the express\npurpose of enticing Pao-yü to read them. As soon as Pao-yü caught sight\nof them, he felt as if he had obtained some gem or jewel. “But you\nmustn’t,” Ming Yen went on to enjoin him, “take them into the garden;\nfor if any one were to come to know anything about them, I shall then\nsuffer more than I can bear; and you should, when you go along, hide\nthem in your clothes!”",
        "But would Pao-yü agree to not introducing them into the garden? So after\nmuch wavering, he picked out only several volumes of those whose style\nwas more refined, and took them in, and threw them over the top of his\nbed for him to peruse when no one was present; while those coarse and\nvery indecent ones, he concealed in a bundle in the outer library.",
        "On one day, which happened to be the middle decade of the third moon,\nPao-yü, after breakfast, took a book, the “Hui Chen Chi,” in his hand\nand walked as far as the bridge of the Hsin Fang lock. Seating himself\non a block of rock, that lay under the peach trees in that quarter, he\nopened the Hui Chen Chi and began to read it carefully from the\nbeginning. But just as he came to the passage: “the falling red\n(flowers) have formed a heap,” he felt a gust of wind blow through the\ntrees, bringing down a whole bushel of peach blossoms; and, as they\nfell, his whole person, the entire surface of the book as well as a\nlarge extent of ground were simply bestrewn with petals of the blossoms.\nPao-yü was bent upon shaking them down; but as he feared lest they\nshould be trodden under foot, he felt constrained to carry the petals in\nhis coat and walk to the bank of the pond and throw them into the\nstream. The petals floated on the surface of the water, and, after\nwhirling and swaying here and there, they at length ran out by the Hsin\nFang lock. But, on his return under the tree, he found the ground again\none mass of petals, and Pao-yü was just hesitating what to do, when he\nheard some one behind his back inquire, “What are you up to here?” and\nas soon as Pao-yü turned his head round, he discovered that it was Lin\r\nTai-yü, who had come over carrying on her shoulder a hoe for raking\nflowers, that on this hoe was suspended a gauze-bag, and that in her\nhand she held a broom.",
        "“That’s right, well done!” Pao-yü remarked smiling; “come and sweep\nthese flowers, and throw them into the water yonder. I’ve just thrown a\nlot in there myself!”",
        "“It isn’t right,” Lin Tai-yü rejoined, “to throw them into the water.\nThe water, which you see, is clean enough here, but as soon as it finds\nits way out, where are situated other people’s grounds, what isn’t there\nin it? so that you would be misusing these flowers just as much as if\nyou left them here! But in that corner, I have dug a hole for flowers,\nand I’ll now sweep these and put them into this gauze-bag and bury them\nin there; and, in course of many days, they will also become converted\ninto earth, and won’t this be a clean way (of disposing of them)?”",
        "Pao-yü, after listening to these words, felt inexpressibly delighted.\n\"Wait!” he smiled, “until I put down my book, and I’ll help you to clear\nthem up!”",
        "“What’s the book?” Tai-yü inquired.",
        "Pao-yü at this question was so taken aback that he had no time to\nconceal it. “It’s,” he replied hastily, “the Chung Yung and the Ta\nHsüeh!”",
        "“Are you going again to play the fool with me? Be quick and give it to\nme to see; and this will be ever so much better a way!”",
        "“Cousin,” Pao-yü replied, “as far as you yourself are concerned I don’t\nmind you, but after you’ve seen it, please don’t tell any one else. It’s\nreally written in beautiful style; and were you to once begin reading\nit, why even for your very rice you wouldn’t have a thought?”",
        "As he spoke, he handed it to her; and Tai-yü deposited all the flowers\non the ground, took over the book, and read it from the very first page;\nand the more she perused it, she got so much the more fascinated by it,\nthat in no time she had finished reading sixteen whole chapters. But\naroused as she was to a state of rapture by the diction, what remained\neven of the fascination was enough to overpower her senses; and though\nshe had finished reading, she nevertheless continued in a state of\nabstraction, and still kept on gently recalling the text to mind, and\nhumming it to herself.",
        "“Cousin, tell me is it nice or not?” Pao-yü grinned.",
        "“It is indeed full of zest!” Lin Tai-yü replied exultingly.",
        "“I’m that very sad and very sickly person,” Pao-yü explained laughing,\n\"while you are that beauty who could subvert the empire and overthrow\nthe city.”",
        "Lin Tai-yü became, at these words, unconsciously crimson all over her\ncheeks, even up to her very ears; and raising, at the same moment, her\ntwo eyebrows, which seemed to knit and yet not to knit, and opening wide\nthose eyes, which seemed to stare and yet not to stare, while her\npeach-like cheeks bore an angry look and on her thin-skinned face lurked\ndispleasure, she pointed at Pao-yü and exclaimed: “You do deserve death,\nfor the rubbish you talk! without any provocation you bring up these\nlicentious expressions and wanton ballads to give vent to all this\ninsolent rot, in order to insult me; but I’ll go and tell uncle and\naunt.”",
        "As soon as she pronounced the two words “insult me,” her eyeballs at\nonce were suffused with purple, and turning herself round she there and\nthen walked away; which filled Pao-yü with so much distress that he\njumped forward to impede her progress, as he pleaded: “My dear cousin, I\nearnestly entreat you to spare me this time! I’ve indeed said what I\nshouldn’t; but if I had any intention to insult you, I’ll throw myself\nto-morrow into the pond, and let the scabby-headed turtle eat me up, so\nthat I become transformed into a large tortoise. And when you shall have\nby and by become the consort of an officer of the first degree, and you\nshall have fallen ill from old age and returned to the west, I’ll come\nto your tomb and bear your stone tablet for ever on my back!”",
        "As he uttered these words, Lin Tai-yü burst out laughing with a sound of\n\"pu ch’ih,” and rubbing her eyes, she sneeringly remarked: “I too can\ncome out with this same tune; but will you now still go on talking\nnonsense? Pshaw! you’re, in very truth, like a spear-head, (which looks)\nlike silver, (but is really soft as) wax!”",
        "“Go on, go on!” Pao-yü smiled after this remark; “and what you’ve said,\nI too will go and tell!”",
        "“You maintain,” Lin Tai-yü rejoined sarcastically, “that after glancing\nat anything you’re able to recite it; and do you mean to say that I\ncan’t even do so much as take in ten lines with one gaze?”",
        "Pao-yü smiled and put his book away, urging: “Let’s do what’s right and\nproper, and at once take the flowers and bury them; and don’t let us\nallude to these things!”",
        "Forthwith the two of them gathered the fallen blossoms; but no sooner\nhad they interred them properly than they espied Hsi Jen coming, who\nwent on to observe: “Where haven’t I looked for you? What! have you\nfound your way as far as this! But our senior master, Mr. Chia She, over\nthere isn’t well; and the young ladies have all gone over to pay their\nrespects, and our old lady has asked that you should be sent over; so go\nback at once and change your clothes!”",
        "When Pao-yü heard what she said, he hastily picked up his books, and\nsaying good bye to Tai-yü, he came along with Hsi Jen, back into his\nroom, where we will leave him to effect the necessary change in his\ncostume. But during this while, Lin Tai-yü was, after having seen Pao-yü\nwalk away, and heard that all her cousins were likewise not in their\nrooms, wending her way back alone, in a dull and dejected mood, towards\nher apartment, when upon reaching the outside corner of the wall of the\nPear Fragrance court, she caught, issuing from inside the walls, the\nharmonious strains of the fife and the melodious modulations of voices\nsinging. Lin Tai-yü readily knew that it was the twelve singing-girls\nrehearsing a play; and though she did not give her mind to go and\nlisten, yet a couple of lines were of a sudden blown into her ears, and\nwith such clearness, that even one word did not escape. Their burden was\nthis:",
        "  These troth are beauteous purple and fine carmine flowers, which in\n      this way all round do bloom,\n  And all together lie ensconced along the broken well, and the\n      dilapidated wall!",
        "But the moment Lin Tai-yü heard these lines, she was, in fact, so\nintensely affected and agitated that she at once halted and lending an\near listened attentively to what they went on to sing, which ran thus:",
        "  A glorious day this is, and pretty scene, but sad I feel at heart!\n  Contentment and pleasure are to be found in whose family courts?",
        "After overhearing these two lines, she unconsciously nodded her head,\nand sighed, and mused in her own mind. “Really,” she thought, “there is\nfine diction even in plays! but unfortunately what men in this world\nsimply know is to see a play, and they don’t seem to be able to enjoy\nthe beauties contained in them.”",
        "At the conclusion of this train of thought, she experienced again a\nsting of regret, (as she fancied) she should not have given way to such\nidle thoughts and missed attending to the ballads; but when she once\nmore came to listen, the song, by some coincidence, went on thus:",
        "  It’s all because thy loveliness is like a flower and like the comely\n      spring,\n  That years roll swiftly by just like a running stream.",
        "When this couplet struck Tai-yu’s ear, her heart felt suddenly a prey to\nexcitement and her soul to emotion; and upon further hearing the words:",
        "  Alone you sit in the secluded inner rooms to self-compassion giving\n      way.",
        "–and other such lines, she became still more as if inebriated, and like\nas if out of her head, and unable to stand on her feet, she speedily\nstooped her body, and, taking a seat on a block of stone, she minutely\npondered over the rich beauty of the eight characters:",
        "  It’s all because thy loveliness is like a flower and like the comely\n      spring,\n  That years roll swiftly by just like a running stream.",
        "Of a sudden, she likewise bethought herself of the line:",
        "  Water flows away and flowers decay, for both no feelings have.",
        "–which she had read some days back in a poem of an ancient writer, and\nalso of the passage:",
        "  When on the running stream the flowers do fall, spring then is past\n      and gone;",
        "–and of:",
        "  Heaven (differs from) the human race,",
        "–which also appeared in that work; and besides these, the lines, which\nshe had a short while back read in the Hsi Hiang Chi:",
        "  The flowers, lo, fall, and on their course the waters red do flow!\n  Petty misfortunes of ten thousand kinds (my heart assail!)",
        "both simultaneously flashed through her memory; and, collating them all\ntogether, she meditated on them minutely, until suddenly her heart was\nstricken with pain and her soul fleeted away, while from her eyes\ntrickled down drops of tears. But while nothing could dispel her present\nstate of mind, she unexpectedly realised that some one from behind gave\nher a tap; and, turning her head round to look, she found that it was a\nyoung girl; but who it was, the next chapter will make known.",
        "  The drunken Chin Kang makes light of lucre and shows a preference for\n      generosity.\n  The foolish girl mislays her handkerchief and arouses mutual thoughts.",
        "But to return to our narrative. Lin Tai-yü’s sentimental reflections\nwere the while reeling and ravelling in an intricate maze, when\nunexpectedly some one from behind gave her a tap, saying: “What are you\nup to all alone here?” which took Lin Tai-yu so much by surprise that\nshe gave a start, and turning her head round to look and noticing that\nit was Hsiang Ling and no one else; “You stupid girl!” Lin Tai-yü\nreplied, “you’ve given me such a fright! But where do you come from at\nthis time?”",
        "Hsiang Ling giggled and smirked. “I’ve come,” she added, “in search of\nour young lady, but I can’t find her anywhere. But your Tzu Chuan is\nalso looking after you; and she says that lady Secunda has sent a\npresent to you of some tea. But you had better go back home and sit\ndown.”",
        "As she spoke, she took Tai-yü by the hand, and they came along back to\nthe Hsiao Hsiang Kuan; where lady Feng had indeed sent her two small\ncatties of a new season tea, of superior quality. But Lin Tai-yü sat\ndown, in company with Hsiang Ling, and began to converse on the merits\nof this tapestry and the fineness of that embroidery; and after they had\nalso had a game at chess, and read a few sentences out of a book, Hsiang\nLing took her departure. But we need not speak of either of them, but\nreturn now to Pao-yü. Having been found, and brought back home, by Hsi\nJen, he discovered Yuan Yang reclining on the bed, in the act of\nexamining Hsi Jen’s needlework; but when she perceived Pao-yü arrive,\nshe forthwith remarked: “Where have you been? her venerable ladyship is\nwaiting for you to tell you to go over and pay your obeisance to our\nSenior master, and don’t you still make haste to go and change your\nclothes and be off!”",
        "Hsi Jen at once walked into the room to fetch his clothes, and Pao-yü\nsat on the edge of the bed, and pushed his shoes off with his toes; and,\nwhile waiting for his boots to put them on, he turned round and\nperceiving that Yüan Yang, who was clad in a light red silk jacket and a\ngreen satin waistcoat, and girdled with a white crepe sash, had her face\nturned the other way, and her head lowered giving her attention to the\ncriticism of the needlework, while round her neck she wore a collar with\nembroidery, Pao-yü readily pressed his face against the nape of her\nneck, and as he sniffed the perfume about it, he did not stay his hand\nfrom stroking her neck, which in whiteness and smoothness was not below\nthat of Hsi Jen; and as he approached her, “My dear girl,” he said\nsmiling and with a drivelling face, “do let me lick the cosmetic off\nyour mouth!” clinging to her person, as he uttered these words, like\ntwisted sweetmeat.",
        "“Hsi Jen!” cried Yüan Yang at once, “come out and see! You’ve been with\nhim a whole lifetime, and don’t you give him any advice; but let him\nstill behave in this fashion!” Whereupon, Hsi Jen walked out, clasping\nthe clothes, and turning to Pao-yü, she observed, “I advise you in this\nway and it’s no good, I advise you in that way and you don’t mend; and\nwhat do you mean to do after all? But if you again behave like this, it\nwill then, in fact, be impossible for me to live any longer in this\nplace!”",
        "As she tendered these words of counsel, she urged him to put his clothes\non, and, after he had changed, he betook himself, along with Yuan Yang,\nto the front part of the mansion, and bade good-bye to dowager lady\nChia; after which he went outside, where the attendants and horses were\nall in readiness; but when he was about to mount his steed, he perceived\nChia Lien back from his visit and in the act of dismounting; and as the\ntwo of them stood face to face, and mutually exchanged some inquiries,\nthey saw some one come round from the side, and say: “My respects to\nyou, uncle Pao-yü!”",
        "When Pao-yü came to look at him, he noticed that this person had an\noblong face, that his body was tall and lanky, that his age was only\neighteen or nineteen, and that he possessed, in real truth, an air of\nrefinement and elegance; but though his features were, after all,\nexceedingly familiar, he could not recall to mind to what branch of the\nfamily he belonged, and what his name was.",
        "“What are you staring vacantly for?” Chia Lien inquired laughing.",
        "“Don’t you even recognise him? He’s Yün Erh, the son of our fifth\nsister-in-law, who lives in the back court!”",
        "“Of course!” Pao-yü assented complacently. “How is it that I had\nforgotten just now!” And having gone on to ask how his mother was, and\nwhat work he had to do at present; “I’ve come in search of uncle\nSecundus, to tell him something,” Chia Yün replied, as he pointed at\nChia Lien.",
        "“You’ve really improved vastly from what you were before,” added Pao-yü\nsmiling; “you verily look just is if you were my son!”",
        "“How very barefaced!” Chia Lien exclaimed as he burst out laughing;\n\"here’s a person four or five years your senior to be made your son!”",
        "“How far are you in your teens this year?” Pao-yü inquired with a smile.",
        "“Eighteen!” Chia Yün rejoined.",
        "This Chia Yün was, in real deed, sharp and quick-witted; and when he\nheard Pao-yü remark that he looked like his son, he readily gave a\nsarcastic smile and observed, “The proverb is true which says, ’the\ngrandfather is rocked in the cradle while the grandson leans on a\nstaff.’ But though old enough in years, I’m nevertheless like a\nmountain, which, in spite of its height, cannot screen the sun from\nview. Besides, since my father’s death, I’ve had no one to look after\nme, and were you, uncle Pao, not to disdain your doltish nephew, and to\nacknowledge me as your son, it would be your nephew’s good fortune!”",
        "“Have you heard what he said?” Chia Lien interposed cynically. “But to\nacknowledge him as a son is no easy question to settle!” and with these\nwords, he walked in; whereupon Pao-yü smilingly said: “To-morrow when\nyou have nothing to do, just come and look me up; but don’t go and play\nany devilish pranks with them! I’ve just now no leisure, so come\nto-morrow, into the library, where I’ll have a chat with you for a whole\nday, and take you into the garden for some fun!”",
        "With this remark still on his lips, he laid hold of the saddle and\nmounted his horse; and, followed by the whole bevy of pages, he crossed\nover to Chia She’s on this side; where having discovered that Chia She\nhad nothing more the matter with him than a chill which he had suddenly\ncontracted, he commenced by delivering dowager lady Chia’s message, and\nnext paid his own obeisance. Chia She, at first, stood up and made\nsuitable answer to her venerable ladyship’s inquiries, and then calling\na servant, “Take the gentleman,” he said, “into my lady’s apartment to\nsit down.”",
        "Pao-yü withdrew out of the room, and came by the back to the upper\napartment; and as soon as madame Hsing caught sight of him, she, before\neverything else, rose to her feet and asked after old lady Chia’s\nhealth; after which, Pao-yü made his own salutation, and madame Hsing\ndrew him on to the stove-couch, where she induced him to take a seat,\nand eventually inquired after the other inmates, and also gave orders to\nserve the tea. But scarcely had they had tea, before they perceived Chia\nTsung come in to pay his respects to Pao-yü.",
        "“Where could one find such a living monkey as this!” madame Hsing\nremarked; “is that nurse of yours dead and gone that she doesn’t even\nkeep you clean and tidy, and that she lets you go about with those\neyebrows of yours so black and that mouth so filthy! you scarcely look\nlike the child of a great family of scholars.”",
        "While she spoke, she perceived both Chia Huan and Chia Lan, one of whom\nwas a young uncle and the other his nephew, also advance and present\ntheir compliments, and madame Hsing bade the two of them sit down on the\nchairs. But when Chia Huan noticed that Pao-yü sat on the same rug with\nmadame Hsing, and that her ladyship was further caressing and petting\nhim in every possible manner, he soon felt so very unhappy at heart,\nthat, after sitting for a short time, he forthwith made a sign to Chia\nLan that he would like to go; and as Chia Lan could not but humour him,\nthey both got up together to take their leave. But when Pao-yü perceived\nthem rise, he too felt a wish to go back along with them, but madame\nHsing remarked smilingly, “You had better sit a while as I’ve something\nmore to tell you,” so that Pao-yü had no alternative but to stay. “When\nyou get back,” madame Hsing added, addressing the other two, “present,\neach one of you, my regards to your respective mothers. The young\nladies, your cousins, are all here making such a row that my head is\ndazed, so that I won’t to-day keep you to have your repast here.” To\nwhich Chia Huan and Chia Lan assented and quickly walked out.",
        "“If it be really the case that all my cousins have come over,” Pao-yü\nventured with a smirk, “how is it that I don’t see them?”",
        "“After sitting here for a while,” madame Hsing explained, “they all went\nat the back; but in what rooms they have gone, I don’t know.”",
        "“My senior aunt, you said you had something to tell me, Pao-yü observed;\nwhat’s it, I wonder?”",
        "“What can there possibly be to tell you?” madame Hsing laughed; “it was\nsimply to make you wait and have your repast with the young ladies and\nthen go; but there’s also a fine plaything that I’ll give you to take\nback to amuse yourself with.”",
        "These two, the aunt and her nephew, were going on with their colloquy\nwhen, much to their surprise, it was time for dinner and the young\nladies were all invited to come. The tables and chairs were put in their\nplaces, and the cups and plates were arranged in proper order; and,\nafter the mother, her daughter and the cousins had finished their meal,\nPao-yü bade good-bye to Chia She and returned home in company with all\nthe young ladies; and when they had said good-night to dowager lady\nChia, madame Wang and the others, they each went back into their rooms\nand retired to rest; where we shall leave them without any further\ncomment and speak of Chia Yün’s visit to the mansion. As soon as he saw\nChia Lien, he inquired what business it was that had turned up, and Chia\nLien consequently explained: “The other day something did actually\npresent itself, but as it happened that your aunt had again and again\nentreated me, I gave it to Chia Ch’in; as she promised me that there\nwould be by and by in the garden several other spots where flowers and\ntrees would be planted; and that when this job did occur, she would, for\na certainty, give it to you and finish!”",
        "Chia Yün, upon hearing these words, suggested after a short pause; “If\nthat be so, there’s nothing for me to do than to wait; but, uncle, you\ntoo mustn’t make any allusion beforehand in the presence of aunt to my\nhaving come to-day to make any inquiries; for there will really be ample\ntime to speak to her when the job turns up!”",
        "“Why should I allude to it?” Chia Lien rejoined. “Have I forsooth got\nall this leisure to talk of irrelevant matters! But to-morrow, besides,\nI’ve got to go as far as Hsing Yi for a turn, and it’s absolutely\nnecessary that I should hurriedly come back the very same day; so off\nwith you now and go and wait; and the day after to-morrow, after the\nwatch has been set, come and ask for news; but mind at any earlier hour,\nI shan’t have any leisure!” With these words, he hastily went at the\nback to change his clothes. And from the time Chia Yun put his foot out\nof the door of the Jung Kuo mansion, he was, the whole way homeward,\nplunged in deep thought; but having bethought himself of some expedient,\nhe straightway wended his steps towards the house of his maternal uncle,\nPu Shih-jen. This Pu Shih-jen, it must be explained, kept, at the\npresent date, a shop for the sale of spices. He had just returned home\nfrom his shop, and as soon as he noticed Chia Yun, he inquired of him\nwhat business brought him there.",
        "“There’s something,” Chia Yun replied, “in which I would like to crave\nyour assistance, uncle; I’m in need of some baroos camphor and musk, so\nplease, uncle, give me on credit four ounces of each kind, and on the\nfestival of the eighth moon, I’ll bring you the amount in full.”",
        "Pu Shih-jen gave a sardonic smile. “Don’t,” he said, “again allude to\nany such thing as selling on tick! Some time back a partner in our\nestablishment got several ounces of goods for his relatives on credit,\nand up to this date the bill hasn’t as yet been settled; the result\nbeing that we’ve all had to make the amount good, so that we’ve entered\ninto an agreement that we should no more allow any one to obtain on tick\nanything on behalf of either relative or friend, and that whoever acted\ncontrary to this resolution should be, at once, fined twenty taels, with\nwhich to stand a treat. Besides, the stock of these articles is now\nshort, and were you also to come, with ready money to this our mean shop\nto buy any, we wouldn’t even have as much to give you. The best way\ntherefore is for you to go elsewhere. This is one side of the question;\nfor on the other, you can’t have anything above-board in view; and were\nyou to obtain what you want as a loan you would again go and play the\ngiddy dog! But you’ll simply say that on every occasion your uncle sees\nyou, he avails himself of it to find fault with you, but a young fellow\nlike you doesn’t know what’s good and what is bad; and you should,\nbesides, make up your mind to earn a few cash, wherewith to clothe and\nfeed yourself, so that, when I see you, I too may rejoice!”",
        "“What you, uncle, say,” Chia Yun rejoined smiling, “is perfectly right;\nthe only thing is that at the time of my father’s death, I was likewise\nso young in years that I couldn’t understand anything; but later on, I\nheard my mother explain how that for everything, it was lucky that you,\nafter all, my uncles, went over to our house and devised the ways and\nmeans, and managed the funeral; and is it likely you, uncle, aren’t\naware of these things? Besides, have I forsooth had a single acre of\nland or a couple of houses, the value of which I’ve run through as soon\nas it came into my hands? An ingenious wife cannot make boiled rice\nwithout raw rice; and what would you have me do? It’s your good fortune\nhowever that you’ve got to deal with one such as I am, for had it been\nany one else barefaced and shameless, he would have come, twice every\nthree days, to worry you, uncle, by asking for two pints of rice and two\nof beans, and you then, uncle, would have had no help for it.”",
        "“My dear child,” Pu Shih-jen exclaimed, “had I anything that I could\ncall my own, your uncle as I am, wouldn’t I feel bound to do something\nfor you? I’ve day after day mentioned to your aunt that the misfortune\nwas that you had no resources. But should you ever succeed in making up\nyour mind, you should go into that mighty household of yours, and when\nthe gentlemen aren’t looking, forthwith pocket your pride and hobnob\nwith those managers, or possibly with the butlers, as you may, even\nthrough them, be able to get some charge or other! The other day, when I\nwas out of town, I came across that old Quartus of the third branch of\nthe family, astride of a tall donkey, at the head of four or five\ncarriages, in which were about forty to fifty bonzes and Taoist priests\non their way to the family fane, and that man can’t lack brains, for\nsuch a charge to have fallen to his share!”",
        "Chia Yün, upon hearing these words, indulged in a long and revolting\nrigmarole, and then got up to take his leave.",
        "“What are you in such a hurry for?” Pu Shih-jen remarked. “Have your\nmeal and then go!”",
        "But this remark was scarcely ended when they heard his wife say: “Are\nyou again in the clouds? When I heard that there was no rice, I bought\nhalf a catty of dry rice paste, and brought it here for you to eat; and\ndo you pray now still put on the airs of a well-to-do, and keep your\nnephew to feel the pangs of hunger?”",
        "“Well, then, buy half a catty more, and add to what there is, that’s\nall,” Pu Shih-jen continued; whereupon her mother explained to her\ndaughter, Yin Chieh, “Go over to Mrs. Wang’s opposite, and ask her if\nshe has any cash, to lend us twenty or thirty of them; and to-morrow,\nwhen they’re brought over, we’ll repay her.”",
        "But while the husband and wife were carrying on this conversation, Chia\nYün had, at an early period, repeated several times: “There’s no need to\ngo to this trouble,” and off he went, leaving no trace or shadow behind.\nBut without passing any further remarks on the husband and wife of the\nPu family, we will now confine ourselves to Chia Yün. Having gone in\nhigh dudgeon out of the door of his uncle’s house, he started straight\non his way back home; but while distressed in mind, and preoccupied with\nhis thoughts, he paced on with drooping head, he unexpectedly came into\ncollision with a drunken fellow, who gripped Chia Yün, and began to\nabuse him, crying: “Are your eyes gone blind, that you come bang against\nme?”",
        "The tone of voice, when it reached Chia Yün ears, sounded like that of\nsome one with whom he was intimate; and, on careful scrutiny, he found,\nin fact, that it was his next-door neighbour, Ni Erh. This Ni Erh was a\ndissolute knave, whose only idea was to give out money at heavy rates of\ninterest and to have his meals in the gambling dens. His sole delight\nwas to drink and to fight.",
        "He was, at this very moment, coming back home from the house of a\ncreditor, whom he had dunned, and was already far gone with drink, so\nthat when, at an unforeseen moment, Chia Yün ran against him, he meant\nthere and then to start a scuffle with him.",
        "“Old Erh!” Chia Yün shouted, “stay your hand; it’s I who have hustled\nagainst you.”",
        "As soon as Ni Erh heard the tone of his voice, he opened wide his\ndrunken eyes and gave him a look; and realising that it was Chia Yün, he\nhastened to loosen his grasp and to remark with a smile, as he staggered\nabout, “Is it you indeed, master Chia Secundus? where were you off to\nnow?”",
        "“I couldn’t tell you!” Chia Yün rejoined; “I’ve again brought\ndispleasure upon me, and all through no fault of mine.”",
        "“Never mind!” urged Ni Erh, “if you’re in any trouble you just tell me,\nand I’ll give vent to your spite for you; for in these three streets,\nand six lanes, no matter who may give offence to any neighbours of mine,\r\nof me, Ni Erh, the drunken Chin Kang, I’ll wager that I compel that\nman’s family to disperse, and his home to break up!”",
        "“Old Ni, don’t lose your temper,” Chia Yün protested, “but listen and\nlet me tell you what happened!” After which, he went on to tell Ni Erh\nthe whole affair with Pu Shih-jen. As soon as Ni Erh heard him, he got\ninto a frightful rage; “Were he not,” he shouted, a “relative of yours,\nmaster Secundus, I would readily give him a bit of my mind! Really\nresentment will stifle my breath! but never mind! you needn’t however\ndistress yourself. I’ve got here a few taels ready at hand, which, if\nyou require, don’t scruple to take; and from such good neighbours as you\nare, I won’t ask any interest upon this money.”",
        "With this remark still on his lips, he produced from his pouch a bundle\nof silver.",
        "“Ni Erh has, it is true, ever been a rogue,” Chia Yün reflected in his\nown mind, “but as he is regulated in his dealings by a due regard to\npersons, he enjoys, to a great degree, the reputation of generosity; and\nwere I to-day not to accept this favour of his, he’ll, I fear, be put to\nshame; and it won’t contrariwise be nice on my part! and isn’t it better\nthat I should make use of his money, and by and by I can repay him\ndouble, and things will be all right!”",
        "“Old Erh,” he therefore observed aloud with a smile, “you’re really a\nfine fellow, and as you’ve shown me such eminent consideration, how can\nI presume not to accept your offer! On my return home, I’ll write the\ncustomary I.O.U., and send it to you, and all will be in order.”",
        "Ni Erh gave a broad grin. “It’s only fifteen taels and three mace,” he\nanswered, “and if you insist upon writing an I.O.U., I won’t then lend\nit to you!”",
        "Chia Yün at these words, took over the money, smiling the while. “I’ll\nreadily,” he retorted, “comply with your wishes and have done; for\nwhat’s the use of exasperating you!”",
        "“Well then that will be all right!” Ni Erh laughed; “but the day is\ngetting dark; and I shan’t ask you to have a cup of tea or stand you a\ndrink, for I’ve some small things more to settle. As for me, I’m going\nover there, but you, after all, should please wend your way homewards;\nand I shall also request you to take a message for me to my people. Tell\nthem to close the doors and turn in, as I’m not returning home; and that\nin the event of anything occurring, to bid our daughter come over\nto-morrow, as soon as it is daylight, to short-legged Wang’s house, the\nhorse-dealer’s, in search of me!” And as he uttered this remark he\nwalked away, stumbling and hobbling along. But we will leave him without\nfurther notice and allude to Chia Yün.",
        "He had, at quite an unexpected juncture, met this piece of luck, so that\nhis heart was, of course, delighted to the utmost degree. “This Ni Erh,\"\nhe mused, “is really a good enough sort of fellow, but what I dread is\nthat he may have been open-handed in his fit of drunkenness, and that he\nmayn’t, by and by, ask for his money to be paid twice over; and what\nwill I do then? Never mind,” he suddenly went on to ponder, “when that\njob has become an accomplished fact, I shall even have the means to pay\nhim back double the original amount.”",
        "Prompted by this resolution, he came over to a money-shop, and when he\nhad the silver weighed, and no discrepancy was discovered in the weight,\nhe was still more elated at heart; and on his way back, he first and\nforemost delivered Ni Erh’s message to his wife, and then returned to\nhis own home, where he found his mother seated all alone on a\nstove-couch spinning thread. As soon as she saw him enter, she inquired\nwhere he had been the whole day long, in reply to which Chia Yün,\nfearing lest his parent should be angry, forthwith made no allusion to\nwhat transpired with Pu Shih-jen, but simply explained that he had been\nin the western mansion, waiting for his uncle Secundus, Lien. This over,\nhe asked his mother whether she had had her meal or not, and his parent\nsaid by way of reply: “I’ve had it, but I’ve kept something for you in\r\nthere,” and calling to the servant-maid, she bade her bring it round,\nand set it before him to eat. But as it was already dark, when the lamps\nhad to be lit, Chia Yün, after partaking of his meal, got ready and\nturned in.",
        "Nothing of any notice transpired the whole night; but the next day, as\nsoon it was dawn, he got up, washed his face, and came to the main\nstreet, outside the south gate, and purchasing some musk from a\nperfumery shop, he, with rapid stride, entered the Jung Kuo mansion; and\nhaving, as a result of his inquiries, found out that Chia Lien had gone\nout of doors, Chia Yün readily betook himself to the back, in front of\nthe door of Chia Lien’s court, where he saw several servant-lads, with\nimmense brooms in their hands, engaged in that place in sweeping the\ncourt. But as he suddenly caught sight of Chou Jui’s wife appear outside\nthe door, and call out to the young boys; “Don’t sweep now, our lady is\ncoming out,” Chia Yün eagerly walked up to her and inquired, with a face\nbeaming with smiles: “Where’s aunt Secunda going to?”",
        "To this inquiry, Chou Jui’s wife explained: “Our old lady has sent for\nher, and I expect, it must be for her to cut some piece of cloth or\nother.” But while she yet spoke, they perceived a whole bevy of people,\npressing round lady Feng, as she egressed from the apartment.",
        "Chia Yün was perfectly aware that lady Feng took pleasure in flattery,\nand delighted in display, so that hastily dropping his arms, he with all\nreverence, thrust himself forward and paid his respects to her. But lady\nFeng did not even so much as turn to look at him with straight eyes; but\ncontinued, as hitherto, her way onwards, simply confining herself to\nascertaining whether his mother was all right, and adding: “How is it\nthat she doesn’t come to our house for a stroll?”",
        "“The thing is,” Chia Yün replied, “that she’s not well: she, however,\noften thinks fondly of you, aunt, and longs to see you; but as for\ncoming round, she’s quite unable to do so.”",
        "“You have, indeed, the knack of telling lies!” lady Feng laughed with\nirony; “for hadn’t I alluded to her, she would never have thought of\nme!”",
        "“Isn’t your nephew afraid,” Chia Yün protested smilingly, “of being\nblasted by lightning to have the audacity of telling lies in the\npresence of an elder! Even so late as yesterday evening, she alluded to\nyou, aunt! ’Though naturally,’ she said, ’of a weak constitution, you\nhad, however, plenty to attend to! that it’s thanks to your supremely\neminent energies, aunt, that you’re, after all, able to manage\neverything in such a perfect manner; and that had you ever made the\nslightest slip, there would have long ago crept up, goodness knows, what\ntroubles!’”",
        "As soon as lady Feng heard these words, her whole face beamed with\nsmiles, and she unconsciously halted her steps, while she proceeded to\nask: “How is it that, both your mother and yourself, tattle about me\nbehind my back, without rhyme or reason?”",
        "“There’s a reason for it,” Chia Yün observed, “which is simply this.\nI’ve an excellent friend with considerable money of his own at home, who\nrecently kept a perfumery shop; but as he obtained, by purchase, the\nrank of deputy sub-prefect, he was, the other day, selected for a post\nin Yunnan, in some prefecture or other unknown to me; whither he has\ngone together with his family. He even closed this shop of his, and\nforthwith collecting all his wares, he gave away, what he could give\naway, and what he had to sell at a discount, was sold at a loss; while\nsuch valuable articles, as these, were all presented to relatives or\nfriends; and that’s why it is that I came in for some baroos camphor and\nmusk. But I at the time, deliberated with my mother that to sell them\nbelow their price would be a pity, and that if we wished to give them as\na present to any one, there was no one good enough to use such perfumes.\nBut remembering how you, aunt, had all along in years gone by, even to\nthis day, to spend large bundles of silver, in purchasing such articles,\nand how, not to speak of this year with an imperial consort in the\nPalace, what’s even required for this dragon boat festival, will also\nnecessitate the addition of hundred times as much as the quantity of\nprevious years, I therefore present them to you, aunt, as a token of my\nesteem!”",
        "With these words still on his lips, he simultaneously produced an\nornamented box, which he handed over to her. And as lady Feng was, at\nthis time, making preparations for presents for the occasion of the\ndragon boat festival, for which perfumes were obligatory, she, with all\npromptitude, directed Feng Erh: “Receive Mr. Yün’s present and take it\nhome and hand it over to P’ing Erh. To one,” she consequently added,\n\"who seems to me so full of discrimination, it isn’t a wonder that your\nuncle is repeatedly alluding, and that he speaks highly of you; how that\nyou talk with all intelligence and that you have experience stored up in\nyour mind.”",
        "Chia Yün upon hearing this propitious language, hastily drew near one\nstep, and designedly asked: “Does really uncle often refer to me?”",
        "The moment lady Feng caught this question, she was at once inclined to\ntell him all about the charge to be entrusted to him, but on second\nthought, she again felt apprehensive lest she should be looked lightly\nupon by him, by simply insinuating that she had promptly and needlessly\npromised him something to do, so soon as she got a little scented ware;\nand this consideration urged her to once more restrain her tongue, so\nthat she never made the slightest reference even to so much as one word\nabout his having been chosen to look after the works of planting the\nflowers and trees. And after confining herself to making the first few\nirrelevant remarks which came to her lips, she hastily betook herself\ninto dowager lady Chia’s apartments.",
        "Chia Yün himself did not feel as if he could very well advert to the\nsubject, with the result that he had no alternative but to retrace his\nsteps homewards. But as when he had seen Pao-yü the previous day, he had\nasked him to go into the outer library and wait for him, he therefore\nfinished his meal and then once again entered the mansion and came over\ninto the I Hsia study, situated outside the ceremonial gate, over at old\nlady Chia’s part of the compound, where he discovered the two lads Ming\nYen, whose name had been changed into Pei Ming, and Chu Yo playing at\nchess, and just arguing about the capture of a castle; and besides them,\nYin Ch’uan, Sao Hua, T’iao Yün, Pan Ho, these four or five of them, up\nto larks, stealing the young birds from the nests under the eaves of the\nhouse.",
        "As soon as Chia Yün entered the court, he stamped his foot and shouted,\n\"The monkeys are up to mischief! Here I am, I’ve come;” and when the\ncompany of servant-boys perceived him, they one and all promptly\ndispersed; while Chia Yün walked into the library, and seating himself\nat once in a chair, he inquired, “Has your master Secundus, Mr. Pao,\ncome down?”",
        "“He hasn’t been down here at all to-day,” Pei Ming replied, “but if you,\nMr. Secundus, have anything to tell him, I’ll go and see what he’s up to\nfor you.”",
        "Saying this he there and then left the room; and Chia Yün meanwhile gave\nhimself to the inspection of the pictures and nicknacks. But some\nconsiderable time elapsed, and yet he did not see him arrive; and\nnoticing besides that the other lads had all gone to romp, he was just\nplunged in a state of despondency, when he heard outside the door a\nvoice cry out, with winning tone, and tender accents: “My elder\nbrother!”",
        "Chia Yün looked out, and saw that it was a servant-maid of fifteen or\nsixteen, who was indeed extremely winsome and spruce. As soon however as\nthe maid caught a glimpse of Chia Yün, she speedily turned herself round\nand withdrew out of sight. But, as luck would have it, it happened that\nPei Ming was coming along, and seeing the servant-maid in front of the\ndoor, he observed: “Welcome, welcome! I was quite at a loss how to get\r\nany news of Pao-yü.” And as Chia Yün discerned Pei Ming, he hastily too,\nran out in pursuit of him, and ascertained what was up; whereupon Pei\nMing returned for answer: “I waited a whole day long, and not a single\nsoul came over; but this girl is attached to master Secundus’ (Mr.\nPao’s) rooms!” and, “My dear girl,” he consequently went on to say, “go\nin and take a message. Say that Mr. Secundus, who lives under the\nportico, has come!”",
        "The servant-maid, upon hearing these words, knew at once that he was a\nyoung gentleman belonging to the family in which she served, and she did\nnot skulk out of sight, as she had done in the first instance; but with\na gaze sufficient to kill, she fixed her two eyes upon Chia Yün, when\nshe heard Chia Yün interpose: “What about over the portico and under the\nportico; you just tell him that Yün Erh is come, that’s all.”",
        "After a while this girl gave a sarcastic smile. “My idea is,” she\nventured, “that you, master Secundus, should really, if it so please\nyou, go back, and come again to-morrow; and to-night, if I find time,\nI’ll just put in a word with him!”",
        "“What’s this that you’re driving at?” Pei Ming then shouted.",
        "And the maid rejoined: “He’s not even had a siesta to-day, so that he’ll\nhave his dinner at an early hour, and won’t come down again in the\nevening; and is it likely that you would have master Secundus wait here\nand suffer hunger? and isn’t it better than he should return home? The\nright thing is that he should come to-morrow; for were even by and by\nsome one to turn up, who could take a message, that person would simply\nacquiesce with the lips, but would he be willing to deliver the message\nin for you?”",
        "Chia Yün, upon finding how concise and yet how well expressed this\ngirl’s remarks had been, was bent upon inquiring what her name was; but\nas she was a maid employed in Pao-yü’s apartments, he did not therefore\nfeel justified in asking the question, and he had no other course but to\nadd, “What you say is quite right, I’ll come to-morrow!” and as he\nspoke, he there and then was making his way outside, when Pei Ming\nremarked: “I’ll go and pour a cup of tea; and master Secundus, have your\ntea and then go.”",
        "Chia Yün turned his head round, as he kept on his way, and said by way\nof rejoinder: “I won’t have any tea; for I’ve besides something more to\nattend to!” and while with his lips he uttered these words, he, with his\neyes, stared at the servant-girl, who was still standing in there.",
        "Chia Yün wended his steps straightway home; and the next day, he came to\nthe front entrance, where, by a strange coincidence, he met lady Feng on\nher way to the opposite side to pay her respects. She had just mounted\nher carriage, but perceiving Chia Yün arrive, she eagerly bade a servant\nstop him, and, with the window between them, she smiled and observed:\n\"Yün Erh, you’re indeed bold in playing your pranks with me! I thought\nit strange that you should give me presents; but the fact is you had a\nfavour to ask of me; and your uncle told me even yesterday that you had\nappealed to him!”",
        "Chia Yün smiled. “Of my appeal to uncle, you needn’t, aunt, make any\nmention; for I’m at this moment full of regret at having made it. Had I\nknown, at an early hour, that things would have come to this pass, I\nwould, from the very first, have made my request to you, aunt; and by\nthis time everything would have been settled long ago! But who would\nhave anticipated that uncle was, after all, a man of no worth!”",
        "“Strange enough,” lady Feng remarked sneeringly, “when you found that\nyou didn’t succeed in that quarter, you came again yesterday in search\nof me!”",
        "“Aunt, you do my filial heart an injustice,” Chia Yün protested; “I\nnever had such a thought; had I entertained any such idea, wouldn’t I,\naunt, have made my appeal to you yesterday? But as you are now aware of\neverything, I’ll really put uncle on one side, and prefer my request to\nyou; for circumstances compel me to entreat you, aunt, to be so good as\nto show me some little consideration!”",
        "Lady Feng laughed sardonically. “You people will choose the long road to\nfollow and put me also in a dilemma! Had you told me just one word at an\nearly hour, what couldn’t have been brought about? an affair of state\nindeed to be delayed up to this moment! In the garden, there are to be\nmore trees planted and flowers laid down, and I couldn’t think of any\nperson that I could have recommended, and had you spoken before this,\nwouldn’t the whole question have been settled soon enough?”",
        "“Well, in that case, aunt,” ventured Chia Yün with a smile, “you had\nbetter depute me to-morrow, and have done!”",
        "“This job,” continued lady Feng after a pause, “is not, my impression\nis, very profitable; and if you were to wait till the first moon of next\nyear, when the fireworks, lanterns, and candles will have to be\npurveyed, I’ll depute you as soon as those extensive commissions turn\nup.”",
        "“My dear aunt,” pleaded Chia Yün, “first appoint me to this one, and if\nI do really manage this satisfactorily, you can then commission me with\nthat other!”",
        "“You know in truth how to draw a long thread,” lady Feng observed\nlaughing. “But hadn’t it been that your uncle had spoken to me on your\naccount, I wouldn’t have concerned myself about you. But as I shall\ncross over here soon after the repast, you had better come at eleven\na.m., and fetch the money, for you to enter into the garden the day\nafter to-morrow, and have the flowers planted!”",
        "As she said this, she gave orders to drive the “scented” carriage, and\nwent on her way by the quickest cut; while Chia Yün, who was\nirrepressibly delighted, betook himself into the I Hsia study, and\ninquired after Pao-yü. But, who would have thought it, Pao-yü had, at an\nearly hour, gone to the mansion of the Prince of Pei Ching, so that Chia\nYün had to sit in a listless mood till noon; and when he found out that\nlady Feng had returned, he speedily wrote an acknowledgment and came to\nreceive the warrant. On his arrival outside the court, he commissioned a\nservant to announce him, and Ts’ai Ming thereupon walked out, and merely\nasking for the receipt, went in, and, after filling in the amount, the\nyear and moon, he handed it over to Chia Yün together with the warrant.\nChia Yün received them from him, and as the entry consisted of two\nhundred taels, his heart was full of exultant joy; and turning round, he\nhurried to the treasury, where after he had taken over the amount in\nsilver, he returned home and laid the case before his mother, and\nneedless to say, that both the parent and her son were in high spirits.\nThe next day, at the fifth watch, Chia Yun first came in search of Ni\nErh, to whom he repaid the money, and then taking fifty taels along with\nhim, he sped outside the western gate to the house of Fang Ch’un, a\ngardener, to purchase trees, where we will leave him without saying\nanything more about him.",
        "We will now resume our story with Pao-yü. The day on which he\nencountered Chia Yün, he asked him to come in on the morrow and have a\nchat with him, but this invitation was practically the mere formal talk\nof a rich and well-to-do young man, and was not likely to be so much as\nborne in mind; and so it was that it readily slipped from his memory. On\nthe evening of the day, however, on which he returned home from the\nmansion of the Prince Pei Ching, he came, after paying his salutations\nto dowager lady Chia, madame Wang, and the other inmates, back into the\ngarden; but upon divesting himself of all his fineries, he was just\nabout to have his bath, when, as Hsi Jen had, at the invitation of Hsüeh\nPao-ch’ai, crossed over to tie a few knotted buttons, as Ch’in Wen and\nPi Hen had both gone to hurry the servants to bring the water, as T’an\nYun had likewise been taken home, on account of her mother’s illness,\nand She Yueh, on the other hand, was at present ailing in her quarters,\nwhile the several waiting-maids, who were in there besides to attend to\nthe dirty work, and answer the calls, had, surmising that he would not\nrequisition their services, one and all gone out in search of their\nfriends and in quest of their companions, it occurred, contrary to their\ncalculations, that Pao-yü remained this whole length of time quite alone\nin his apartments; and as it so happened that Pao-yü wanted tea to\ndrink, he had to call two or three times before he at last saw three old\nmatrons walk in. But at the sight of them, Pao-yü hastily waved his hand\nand exclaimed: “No matter, no matter; I don’t want you,” whereupon the\nmatrons had no help but to withdraw out of the rooms; and as Pao-yü\nperceived that there were no waiting-maids at hand, he had to come down\nand take a cup and go up to the teapot to pour the tea; when he heard\nsome one from behind him observe: “Master Secundus, beware, you’ll\nscorch your hand; wait until I come to pour it!” And as she spoke, she\nwalked up to him, and took the cup from his grasp, to the intense\nsurprise, in fact, of Pao-yü, who inquired: “Where were you that you\nhave suddenly come to give me a start?”",
        "The waiting-maid smiled as she handed him the tea. “I was in the back\ncourt,” she replied, “and just came in from the back door of the inner\nrooms; and is it likely that you didn’t, sir, hear the sound of my\nfootsteps?”",
        "Pao-yü drank his tea, and as he simultaneously passed the servant-girl\nunder a minute inspection, he found that though she wore several\narticles of clothing the worse for wear, she was, nevertheless, with\nthat head of beautiful hair, as black as the plumage of a raven, done up\nin curls, her face so oblong, her figure so slim and elegant, indeed,\nsupremely beautiful, sweet, and spruce, and Pao-yü eagerly inquired:\n\"Are you also a girl attached to this room of mine?”",
        "“I am,” rejoined that waiting-maid.",
        "“But since you belong to this room, how is it I don’t know you?” Pao-yü\nadded.",
        "When the maid heard these words, she forced a laugh. “There are even\nmany,” she explained, “that are strangers to you; and is it only myself?\nI’ve never, before this, served tea, or handed water, or brought in\nanything; nor have I attended to a single duty in your presence, so how\ncould you know me?”",
        "“But why don’t you attend to any of those duties that would bring you to\nmy notice?” Pao-yü questioned.",
        "“I too,” answered the maid, “find it as difficult to answer such a\nquestion. There’s however one thing that I must report to you, master\nSecundus. Yesterday, some Mr. Yün Erh or other came to see you; but as I\nthought you, sir, had no leisure, I speedily bade Pei Ming tell him to\ncome early to-day. But you unexpectedly went over again to the mansion\nof the Prince of Pei Ching.”",
        "When she had spoken as far as this, she caught sight of Ch’iu Wen and Pi\nHen enter the court, giggling and laughing; the two of them carrying\nbetween them a bucket of water; and while raising their skirts with one\nhand, they hobbled along, as the water spurted and plashed. The\nwaiting-maid hastily come out to meet them so as to relieve them of\ntheir burden, but Ch’iu Wen and Pi Hen were in the act of standing face\nto face and finding fault with each other; one saying, “You’ve wetted my\nclothes,” the other adding, “You’ve trod on my shoes,” and upon, all of\na sudden, espying some one walk out to receive the water, and\ndiscovering, when they came to see, that it was actually no one else\nthan Hsiao Hung, they were at once both so taken aback that, putting\ndown the bucket, they hurried into the room; and when they looked about\nand saw that there was no other person inside besides Pao-yü they were\nat once displeased. But as they were meanwhile compelled to get ready\nthe articles necessary for his bath, they waited until Pao-yü was about\nto divest himself of his clothes, when the couple of them speedily\npulled the door to behind them, as they went out, and walked as far as\nthe room on the opposite side, in search of Hsiao Hung; of whom they\ninquired: “What were you doing in his room a short while back?”",
        "“When was I ever in the room?” Hsiao Hung replied; “simply because I\nlost sight of my handkerchief, I went to the back to try and find it,\nwhen unexpectedly Mr. Secundus, who wanted tea, called for you sisters;\nand as there wasn’t one even of you there, I walked in and poured a cup\nfor him, and just at that very moment you sisters came back.”",
        "“You barefaced, low-bred thing!” cried Ch’iu Wen, turning towards her\nand spurting in her face. “It was our bounden duty to tell you to go and\nhurry them for the water, but you simply maintained that you were busy\nand made us go instead, in order to afford you an opportunity of\nperforming these wily tricks! and isn’t this raising yourself up li by\nli? But don’t we forsooth, even so much as come up to you? and you just\ntake that looking-glass and see for yourself, whether you be fit to\nserve tea and to hand water or not?”",
        "“To-morrow,” continued Pi Hea, “I’ll tell them that whenever there’s\nanything to do connected with his wanting tea, or asking for water, or\nwith fetching things for him, not one of us should budge, and that\nshe alone should be allowed to go, and have done!”",
        "“If this be your suggestion,” remarked Ch’iu Wen, “wouldn’t it be still\nbetter that we should all disperse, and let her reign supreme in this\nroom!”",
        "But while the two of them were up to this trouble, one saying one thing,\nand another, another, they caught sight of two old nurses walk in to\ndeliver a message from lady Feng; who explained: “To-morrow, someone\nwill bring in gardeners to plant trees, and she bids you keep under more\nrigorous restraint, and not sun your clothes and petticoats anywhere and\neverywhere; nor air them about heedlessly; that the artificial hill\nwill, all along, be entirely shut in by screening curtains, and that you\nmustn’t he running about at random.”",
        "“I wonder,” interposed Ch’iu Wen with alacrity, “who it is that will\nbring the workmen to-morrow, and supervise the works?”",
        "“Some one or other called Mr. Yün, living at the back portico,” the old\nwoman observed.",
        "But Ch’iu Wen and Pi Hen were neither of them acquainted with him, and\nthey went on promiscuously asking further questions on his account, but\nHsiao Hung knew distinctly in her mind who it was, and was well aware\nthat it was the person whom she had seen, the previous day, in the outer\nlibrary.",
        "The surname of this Hsiao Hung had, in fact, been originally Lin, while\nher infant name had been Hung Yü; but as the word Yü improperly\ncorresponded with the names of Pao-yü and Tai-yü, she was, in due\ncourse, simply called Hsiao Hung. She was indeed an hereditary servant\nof the mansion; and her father had latterly taken over the charge of all\nmatters connected with the farms and farmhouses in every locality. This\nHung-yü came, at the age of sixteen, into the mansion, to enter into\nservice, and was attached to the Hung Yuan, where in point of fact she\nfound both a quiet and pleasant home; and when contrary to all\nexpectation, the young ladies as well as Pao-yü, were subsequently\npermitted to move their quarters into the garden of Broad Vista, it so\nhappened that this place was, moreover, fixed upon by Pao-yü. This Hsiao\nHung was, it is true, a girl without any experience, but as she could,\nto a certain degree, boast of a pretty face, and as, in her own heart,\nshe recklessly fostered the idea of exalting herself to a higher\nstandard, she was ever ready to thrust herself in Pao-yü’s way, with a\nview to showing herself off. But attached to Pao-yü’s personal service\nwere a lot of servants, all of whom were glib and specious, so that how\ncould she ever find an opportunity of thrusting herself forward? But\ncontrary to her anticipations, there turned up, eventually on this day,\nsome faint glimmer of hope, but as she again came in for a spell of\nspiteful abuse from Ch’iu Wen and her companion, her expectations were\nsoon considerably frustrated, and she was just plunged in a melancholy\nmood, when suddenly she heard the old nurse begin the conversation about\nChia Yün, which unconsciously so affected her heart that she hastily\nreturned, quite disconsolate, into her room, and lay herself down on her\nbed, giving herself quietly to reflection. But while she was racking and\ntorturing her brain and at a moment when she was at a loss what decision\nto grasp, her ear unexpectedly caught, emanating from outside the\nwindow, a faint voice say: “Hsiao Hung, I’ve picked up your pocket\nhandkerchief in here!” and as soon as Hsiao Hung heard these words, she\nwalked out with hurried step and found that it was no one else than Chia\nYün in person; and as Hsiao Hung unwillingly felt her powdered face\nsuffused with brushes: “Where did you pick it up, Mr. Secundus?” she\nasked.",
        "“Come over,” Chia Yün smiled, “and I’ll tell you!” And as he uttered\nthese words, he came up and drew her to him; but Hsiao Hung twisted\nherself round and ran away; but was however tripped over by the step of\nthe door.",
